It was observed that the presence of serum reduces the cellular association of 20 nm carboxylate - modified fluorescent polystyrene beads up to 20 - fold , relative to cells incubated in serum - free media . Analysis by confocal microscopy demonstrated that the presence of serum greatly reduces the cell surface association of nanoparticles , as well as the potential for internalization . However , both in the presence and absence of serum , nanoparticle entry depends upon clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Finally , experiments performed with cells cooled to 4 ° C suggest that a proportion of the accumulation of nanoparticles in cells was likely due to direct permeabilization of the plasma membrane . Keywords : nanoparticles , polystyrene beads , serum , endocytosis , dynamin , clathrin , permeabilization Introduction Nanoparticles are defined as structures with at least one dimension smaller than 100 nm . 1 Although humans have always come into contact with naturally occurring nanoparticles , the ever increasing production and application of manufactured nanopar - ticles in industry , research , and medicine has led to greater potential for incidental envi - ronmental contact , as well as deliberate exposure through products and therapeutics . 2 , 3 However , the potential for cellular entry and toxicity of manufactured nanoparticles has only recently begun to be investigated . The extent of potential cellular effects follow - ing nanoparticle exposure can depend upon target cell type , environmental conditions , nanoparticle composition , size , shape , surface chemistry , and dosage . 4 Given the potential for heterogeneity , when comparing different nanoparticles , cells , and experimental conditions , each particular system of interest must be empirically analyzed . Therefore , model nanoparticles with well - defined characteristics have been serving as a valuable tool in understanding the potential for intracellular exposure and cellular toxicity . 5 – 9 Polystyrene nanoparticles can be generated ( eg , FluoSpheres ® from Invitrogen Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) within accurate size ranges , to a nearly uniform shape , and with a variety of surface coatings and fluorescent labels useful for tracking in biological systems . Already , numerous studies have been published analyz - ing the entry of polystyrene nanoparticles into different types of cells ; however , these reports have not been entirely consistent in the observations reported . 5 – 9 In particular , size and surface characteristics have emerged as potentially important characteristics regulating the potential for cellular entry and the specific mechanisms involved . 4 – 10 Dovepress submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com Dovepress 2045 O R I G I N A L RE S E A R C H open access to scientific and medical research Open Access Full Text Article http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 2147 / IJN .

Taken together , the results demonstrate a striking serum dependence for plasma membrane binding and subsequent nanoparticle entry into cells via clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Finally , these studies suggest that plasma membrane permeabilization is another potential mode of nanoparticle entry into cells . This is significant when considering other nanomaterials that are used for humans as this effect was seen both in the presence and absence of serum , suggesting this effect may be size dependent only . Material and methods Cell culture HeLa and MDCK cell lines ( Health Protection Agency Culture Collections , Salisbury , United Kingdom ) were grown at 37 ° C in the presence of 5 % carbon dioxide with Gibco ® Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( Invitrogen ) , and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were detached with trypsin ( Invitrogen ) following Gibco phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) wash ( Invitrogen ) . Detached cells were trans - ferred at appropriate dilutions into new flasks or plated onto 24 mm glass coverslips in six - well plates for fixation . They were incubated in a CO 2 ncubator ( MCO - 17AIC ; SANYO , Osaka , Japan ) at 37 ° C in the presence of 5 % carbon dioxide for ∼ 24 hours prior to transfection ( see below ) or incubation in nanoparticles ( see below ) . Nanoparticle uptake experiments : plate reader Cells were grown in µ Clear ® black 96 - well glass bottom plates ( Greiner Bio - One GmbH , Frickenhausen , Germany ) . Yellow / green and red 20 nm carboxylate - modified polystyrene FluoSpheres ( Invitrogen ) ( stock 0 . 02 g / mL ≡ 4 . 54 × 10 15 nano - particles / mL ) were at a 1 % dilution in either serum - containing or serum - free media and added to cells for 0 , 5 , 15 , 30 , 60 , and 120 minutes . After the allotted time , cells were rinsed twice with 100 µ L PBS and incubated for 5 minutes in 100 µ L of 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hatfield , PA ) in PBS . They were then rinsed twice more with 100 µ L PBS . The fluorescence was observed with PBS solution inside the wells with a FLUOStar Omega fluorescence plate reader ( BMG LABTECH GmbH , Ortenberg , Germany ) . Determination of size and zeta potential by dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering Size ( hydrodynamic diameter ) and zeta potential measure - ments of nanoparticle dispersion were done using a Zetasizer ® Nano ZS ZEN3600 ( Malvern Instruments Ltd , Malvern , United Kingdom ) to investigate possible aggregation of nanoparticles . Nanoparticles were at 0 . 5 % dilution from stock in each experimental variation and sonicated in ultrasonic bath ( XUB18 ; Grant Instruments , Shepreth , UK ) for 20 minutes before measurement . Nanoparticle cytotoxicity experiments Cells were grown on MatTek glass bottom plates ( MatTek Corporation , Ashland , MA ) for 24 hours in 2 mL serum - containing media . The media was exchanged for one of the following : serum - containing media ; serum - free media ; serum - containing media with 1 % nanoparticles from stock solution ; or serum free media with 1 % nanoparticles from stock solution for 15 minutes at 37 ° C . These were then replaced with serum - containing media and returned to the incubator for a further 24 or 72 hours . For counting , the cells were rinsed twice with 2 mL PBS and incubated in 1 mL trypsin for 4 minutes . Cells were put into a Hawksley counting chamber ( AS1000 Improved Neubauer Double Cell Standard ; Hawksley , Sussex , United Kingdom ) and counted . Nanoparticle uptake experiments : microscopy Cells were attached onto glass coverslips and incubated overnight . For the 4 ° C experiment , cells were put on ice for 5 minutes in either serum - containing or serum - free media . Chilled green nanoparticles diluted to 1 % in either serum - containing or serum - free media were introduced to the cells for 15 minutes . For fixation , cells were rinsed in 2 mL chilled PBS twice and fixed with 1 mL 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 minutes . At this time the chilled cells were brought back to room temperature . They were then rinsed twice more with 2 mL PBS and then placed cells down on a coverslip with a small drop of Vectashield ® containing 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( Vector Laboratories Ltd , Peterborough , United Kingdom ) . They were then held in submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com Dovepress Dovepress 2046 Smith et al I n t e r na t i ona l J ou r na l o f N ano m ed i c i ne do w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / www . do v ep r e ss . c o m / b y 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 on 01 - M a y - 2019 F o r pe r s ona l u s e on l y .

Dynasore inhibition of nanoparticle uptake The following day after attachment to glass coverslips , cells were rinsed twice with warm DMEM and incubated with 2 mL per well of DMEM and a 0 . 1 % dilution of dynasore ( Sigma - Aldrich Corporation , St , Louis , MO ) from 80 mM stock or 0 . 1 % dilution of dimethyl sulfoxide ( Sigma - Aldrich ) from 5 µ g / mL stock . After 15 minutes the media was removed and replaced with : 1 mL of either DMEM or DMEM with 10 % fetal calf serum ; 0 . 1 % dilution of dynasore or dimethyl sulfoxide ; and 1 % red FluoSpheres , which were then incubated for 15 minutes . Cells were then rinsed with PBS , fixed , and imaged as below . Nanoparticle uptake studies in dominant negative transfected cells Cells were transfected with 4 µ g of either green fluores - cent protein ( GFP ; Clontech Laboratories Inc , Mountain View , CA ) , EH29 - GFP ( provided by Alexandre Benmerah , Institut Cochin , Paris , France ) , or Caveolin1 ( Y14F ) - GFP ( provided by Mark McNiven , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN ) using Lipofectamine™ 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Nanoparticle uptake assays were conducted the following day with two 2 mL PBS rinses followed by a 15 - minute incubation with DMEM , which was then removed . Cells were incubated with a 1 % dilution ( from stock 0 . 2 mg / mL ) of 20 nm carboxylate - modified polystyrene red FluoSpheres in either 1 mL of DMEM or DMEM with 10 % fetal calf serum media for 15 minutes and washed twice in 2 mL PBS . Coverslips were fixed as above . Transferrin uptake experiments Cells were attached onto glass coverslips and incubated overnight . For the 4 ° C experiment , cells were put on ice for 10 minutes in either serum - containing or serum - free media . Chilled transferrin ( Alexa Fluor 488 - labeled ; Invitrogen ) diluted to 0 . 2 % in serum - free media were introduced to the cells for 15 minutes . For fixation , cells were rinsed in 2 mL chilled PBS twice and fixed with 2 mL 4 % paraformalde - hyde for 5 minutes . Chilled cells were then brought back to room temperature . They were then rinsed twice more with 2 mL PBS and then placed cells down on a coverslip with a small drop of Vectashield containing 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole . They were then held in place using a small coat of nail varnish around the edge and stored in a refrigerator . Sytox ® Green ( Invitrogen ) The Sytox Green for the nanoparticle and control conditions was in serum - free or serum - containing media during incu - bation at a concentration of 0 . 02 % . Alternatively , the fixed cells were incubated for 5 minutes in 0 . 1 % Triton X100 solu - tion ( Sigma – Aldrich Corporation , St Louis , MO ) and then incubated for 5 minutes in a 0 . 02 % Sytox Green solution ( Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY ) before mounting . Imaging and image analysis Images for the comparison of nanoparticle effects at 4 ° C and 37 ° C were taken on an A1R inverted confocal microscope ( Nikon Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) using a 60 × oil immersed objective . All other images were taken using an LSM 710 confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH , Oberkochen , Germany ) using 488 nm and 543 nm lasers with a 40 × or 60 × oil objective lens . All analyses were conducted using NIS - Elements 3 . 2 imaging software ( Nikon ) . A cell that wasn’t in contact with any others was selected , and an image from the center of the confocal Z - stack was chosen . Total intensity of fluorescence per nanoparticle spot ( defined as the visible intracellular accumulations of nanoparticles ) was calculated by drawing around each spot and taking intensity values for it . The intracellular background fluorescence was subtracted ( calculated from an area adjacent to the spot , of equal size ) . The number of nanoparticle spots per cell area was calculated by counting the number of visible nanoparticle spots in the slice chosen , and dividing it by the area of the cell in that slice . Any spots that lay on the cell membrane were not counted . Each experiment was performed three times , and from each experiment ten cells were analyzed . Results Serum effects Previous studies have demonstrated a role for endocytosis pathways in the cellular entry of polystyrene nanoparticles . 5 – 9 Cells are conventionally cultured in the presence of 10 % fetal calf serum ; however , most assays for receptor - mediated endocytosis are performed in serum - free conditions . 13 – 15 Furthermore , it has been previously suggested that the formation of a protein corona around nanoparticles might reduce membrane adsorption , 10 , 16 and that interaction with the membrane may be important in permitting cellular entry . 12 , 17 Therefore , the potential for serum - dependent cellular submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com Dovepress Dovepress 2047 Cellular entry of nanoparticles I n t e r na t i ona l J ou r na l o f N ano m ed i c i ne do w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / www . do v ep r e ss . c o m / b y 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 on 01 - M a y - 2019 F o r pe r s ona l u s e on l y .

HeLa human carcinoma cells were incubated with nano - particles in the presence or absence of serum . As depicted in Figure 1 , analysis of cellular - associated nanoparticle signal in a fluorescence plate reader demonstrated striking serum dependence . In both the presence and absence of serum , a time - dependent cellular nanoparticle signal was observed . However , at each time point evaluated the addition of serum resulted in an up to 20 - fold decrease in cellular - associated nanoparticle signal . Similar effects were observed with MDCK canine epithelial cells ( Figure 1C ) , suggesting that this effect is neither cell type nor species dependent . One possible explanation for the observed serum depen - dence in cellular association of nanoparticles would be that the serum proteins are causing the nanoparticles to aggregate , which might prevent cellular binding and / or entry . However , previously published dynamic light scattering data demon - strate that serum does not cause aggregation of carboxylate - modified polystyrene nanoparticles . 18 Furthermore , this was verified in the dynamic light scattering measurements of the current study ( Figure 1E ) . Another possible explanation for the observed effects could be due to serum directly reducing the fluorescence of the nanoparticles . However , time - lapse confocal microscopy demonstrates that the addition of serum to nanoparticles incubated in the absence of cells did not affect nanoparticle fluorescence ( Figure 2 ) . The particles depicted within a single field were individually quanti - fied over time and no overall decrease in fluorescence was observed . Thus , it can be concluded that serum is directly reducing the potential of nanoparticles to interact with cells , rather than the fluorescence of the nanoparticles . One pos - sible explanation for this can be the serum effects on the zeta potential of the nanoparticles ( Figure 1D ) . The reduced negative charge may be a major contributing factor in the ability of nanoparticles to bind to the cell membrane . One limitation of assays performed in a fluorescence plate reader is that it cannot readily distinguish between fluores - cence associated with the cell surface and intracellular signal . Therefore , to further analyze the effects of serum upon the interactions of nanoparticles with cells , confocal microscopy studies were performed . As depicted in Figure 3 , when imaged with identical laser power and gain settings , both the cell sur - face binding and the intracellular accumulation of nanoparticles was clearly higher in cells incubated in serum - free media when compared to cells exposed to nanoparticles in the presence submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com Dovepress Dovepress 2048 Smith et al I n t e r na t i ona l J ou r na l o f N ano m ed i c i ne do w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / www . do v ep r e ss . c o m / b y 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 on 01 - M a y - 2019 F o r pe r s ona l u s e on l y . Powered by TCPDF ( www . tcpdf . org ) 1 / 1 International Journal of Nanomedicine 2012 : 7 of 10 % serum . Quantification of the brightness of numerous intracellular nanoparticle accumulations reveals significantly higher fluorescence in the serum - free group compared to the serum group ( Figure 3C ) . The higher fluorescence seen on the cell membrane can also be seen ( Figure 3E ) . It should be noted that the blue 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole channel gain and exposure times were adjusted to facilitate the identification of cells , hence the discrepancy in appearance . Although the precise intracellular compartment ( s ) within which the nanoparticles are present is not currently known , the apparent size and brightness is potentially consistent with endosomal localization . Furthermore , when compared with the nanoparticles imaged in vitro ( Figure 2 ) , it is clear that the intracellular nanoparticle accumulations are much larger than the potentially monodisperse population adhered to the cover - slip . Interestingly , it can also be seen from these images that accumulation of nanoparticles in the nucleus was not observed . Finally , the number of intracellular nanoparticle accumulations per unit area was no different between the two conditions ( Figure 3D ) , suggesting that although the total amount of nano - particles able to enter cells is lower in the presence of serum , in both the presence and absence of serum the nanoparticles might be entering cells via the same pathway ( s ) . A cytotoxicity assay was performed to evaluate whether increased cell surface binding of nanoparticles has more of a detrimental effect on cells . As seen in Figure 4 , cells exposed to these polystyrene nanoparticles display a moder - ate degree of cytotoxicity . An approximately 30 % decrease in cell numbers was observed relative to control at both 24 and 72 hours following nanoparticle treatment , both when serum was present and absent at the time of exposure . However , due to internal variance and the modest effect observed , this was only statistically significant in the 24 - hour serum - free and 72 - hour serum - containing conditions . Endocytosis studies Different pathways have been implicated in the cellular entry of nanoparticles depending upon the particular cell line used and / or the physiochemical characteristics of the specific particles being tested ( eg , size , composition , or sur - C 180 160 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 P r e - s e r u m 15 m i n 25 m i n 5 m i n 30 m i n 20 m i n 10 m i n F l uo r esce n ce i n t e n s i t y A B 2 µm 2 µ m 30 minutes post - serum Pre - serum Figure 2 The addition of serum to nanoparticles in the absence of cells does not affect nanoparticle fluorescence .

Dynamin is a large guanosine triphosphatase which regulates several endocytosis pathways and is potently and specifically inhibited by the small molecule dynasore . 19 , 20 As depicted in Figure 5 , in the absence of serum , dynasore treatment results in a clear inhibition of nanoparticle entry . Results from studies in the presence of serum have been omitted as previous studies have shown that serum inhibits dynasore function . 21 Two main endocytosis pathways regulated by dynamin are clathrin - mediated endocytosis and caveolar endocytosis . 19 Therefore , one intention of this work was to determine whether each of these might be involved in nanoparticle entry . Importantly , the authors have extensive experience with these inhibitors in endocytosis assays , and have previously shown positive controls for each . 13 – 15 , 22 – 24 As observed in Figure 6 , expression of the inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis eps15 ( EH29 ) , 25 but not dominant negative caveolin1 , 26 significantly reduced nanoparticle uptake . In cells exposed to nanoparticles in serum free media following transfection with either GFP , as control , EH29 , to inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis , or caveolin1 ( Y14F ) , to inhibit caveolar endocytosis , only EH29 inhibited nanoparticle entry . Quantification revealed that both the brightness and density of intracellular nano - particle accumulations were significantly inhibited by expression of EH29 . Similar observations were obtained in cells expressing these constructs and incubated with nanoparticles in the presence of serum ( Figure 7 ) . Interestingly though , although the expression of EH29 significantly reduced the number of nanoparticle accumulations per cell , relative to the control , while decreased quantitatively , the nanoparticle spot fluores - cence was not significantly different ( P value = 0 . 058 ) .

Therefore , it is possible that inhibiting caveolar endocytosis increases nanoparticle entry , possibly through a similar mechanism as was recently observed in cells taking up fluorescent dextran . 27 In this study , expression of this same mutant increased uptake of 70 kDa dextran in ARPE - 19 cells . Thus , taken together , these results demonstrate that both in the presence and absence of serum , nanoparticles can enter cells through dynamin - dependent / clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and that in this system caveolar endocytosis does not seem to be directly involved in nano - particle entry . Nanoparticle - mediated cellular permeabilization As depicted in Figures 5 – 7 , inhibition of dynamin - dependent / clathrin - mediated endocytosis significantly , but not completely , inhibited nanoparticle entry into cells .

An alternative method for inhibiting endocytosis is to cool cells to 4 ° C , 28 and , as can be seen in Figure 8 , at 4 ° C nanoparticles are still able to gain entry into the cytosol .

This might suggest that an endocytosis - independent route for nanoparticle entry exists , particularly when considering that the presence of serum during nanoparticle incuba - tion at 4 ° C does not inhibit entry ; in fact , the intracellular density of nanoparticle accumulations was slightly higher compared to cells kept in serum - free media . Given the size and negative charge of the nanoparticles being studied , it is not likely that nanoparticles are able to freely diffuse across the plasma membrane . However , it might be that nanoparticles are entering through discontinuities in the plasma membrane , either preexisting or induced by the nanoparticles through direct permeabilization of the cell surface . Sytox Green is a commercially available reagent that is membrane impermeant and brightly fluorescent only fol - lowing binding to nucleic acids . 29 Therefore , Sytox Green can be used to measure the potential for plasma membrane permeabilization . As depicted in Figure 10 , incubation of cells in the presence of nanoparticles at 4 ° C in serum - free and serum - containing media resulted in significantly higher Sytox Green fluorescence than control cells . Strikingly , the extent of Sytox Green fluorescence was roughly equivalent to that observed in cells incubated in the presence of 0 . 1 % Triton X100 , a detergent which is commonly employed to permeabilize the plasma membrane .

Discussion The increased potential for human exposure to manufac - tured nanomaterials emphasizes the need for a greater understanding of cellular nanotoxicology . In many cases , particular nanoparticles and target cell types will need to be empirically investigated as varying cell types react in distinct ways to the introduction of nanoparticles , 9 which themselves display unique behaviors in biological fluid . 30 However , the use of well - characterized model nanoparticles with known properties is necessary to provide insight into potentially biomedically relevant phenomena . In this study , a detailed analysis of the route of entry for 20 nm carboxylate - modified polystyrene nanoparticles was performed . The results of the analyses provide exciting new observations which open up new perspectives in the field of cellular nanotoxicology , and suggest several mechanisms relevant to nanoparticle entry that should be considered in future studies . The first series of experiments consider the potential effects of serum on nanoparticle entry into cultured cells . With a fluorescence plate reader , a striking reduction in cellular - associated nanoparticle signal was observed when cells were incubated with nanoparticles in serum - containing , versus serum - free , conditions . Furthermore , this was observed with cells from different organisms , and in both epithelial and transformed cells . A more detailed analysis through confocal microscopy revealed that the presence of serum both reduced nanoparticle signal at the plasma membrane and intracellular accumulation . Therefore , serum appears to be able to reduce the ability of nanoparticles to bind to and enter cells , observations previously alluded to with the use of larger ( eg , ∼ 64 nm ) positively - charged nanoparticles . 10 Next , several potential mechanisms for nanoparticle internalization into cells were evaluated . In both serum - free and serum - containing studies , it was demonstrated that these nanoparticles can enter cells through dynamin - dependent / clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and not caveolar endocytosis . However , the presence of endocytosis - independent nanopar - ticle uptake was also able to be demonstrated . The analyses demonstrate that 20 nm carboxylate - modified polystyrene nanoparticles have the capacity to induce plasma membrane permeabilization . Therefore , this may reflect an alternative means by which nanoparticles are able to gain entry to the intracellular space , and potentially cause cellular damage . In the current study , it was demonstrated that nano - particle interaction with , and subsequent entry into cells , is significantly inhibited by the presence of serum . It has been noted that a highly fluidic protein corona with a rapid exchange rate is less likely to adsorb to the plasma mem - brane , 16 possibly due to the resulting reduced zeta potential . Furthermore , carboxy functionalization of nanoparticles has been proposed to be more amiable to nanoparticle – protein interactions than amino modifications . 11 Finally , the relation - ship between decreased membrane adsorption and reduced uptake of nanoparticles has been previously suggested . 10 , 17 10 µ m 10 µ m 10 µ m D E SFM Serum A ve r a g e sy t o x g r ee n f l uo r esce n ce p e r ce ll A ve r a g e sy t o x g r ee n f l uo r esce n ce p e r ce ll A Control B NPs C TritonX 100 P - value < 0 . 05 P - value < 0 . 05 P - value < 0 . 05 P - value < 0 . 05 Control 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 NPs TritonX 100 Control NPs TritonX 100 Figure 10 Incubation of HeLa cells in the presence of nanoparticles at 4 ° C in serum - free media resulted in significantly higher Sytox ® Green ( Invitrogen Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) fluorescence than control cells .

Powered by TCPDF ( www . tcpdf . org ) 1 / 1 International Journal of Nanomedicine 2012 : 7 Taken together , this suggests that the addition of serum gen - erates a highly fluidic protein corona with a rapid exchange rate which prevents absorption to the plasma membrane and subsequent internalization . In order to quantitatively assess the relative potential for nanoparticle entry through the fluid phase , dispersed in the lumen of a vesicle , as opposed to through receptor - mediated means , adhered to the inner membrane of the vesicle , a series of calculations was performed to estimate the number of nanoparticles that could enter a vesicle under the incubation conditions described above ( Figure 11 ) . This analysis assumed a total vesicle diameter of 150 nm , 31 and that the entire cell surface has the capacity to be coated in nanoparticles . Even though the latter might be an overestimation , the current analyses suggest that under these conditions nanoparticles are nearly 25 , 000 times more likely to enter cells bound to the inner membrane of a vesicle than through the fluid phase . Thus , when taken together , the data suggest that cellular entry of 20 nm carboxylate - modified polystyrene nanoparticles is reduced in the presence of serum primarily through inhibition of cell surface binding , that clathrin - mediated endocytosis represents a significant route for nanoparticle uptake , and that these nano - particles potentially have the capacity to enter the cell directly through permeabilization of the plasma membrane . Conclusion In summary , the current report analyzes the cellular inter - nalization of model nanoparticles , focusing on factors which might affect the association of nanoparticles with cells and possible routes of entry into cells . It has been established that the presence of serum in media greatly decreases cellular nanoparticle fluorescence intensity . This was shown to be neither cell type nor species dependent . Furthermore , it was shown that nanoparticle entry into cells was greatly reduced when inhibiting the dynamin - dependent / clathrin - mediated endocytosis pathway . Finally , using a membrane impermeant nucleic acid stain , it was shown that the presence of nano - particles permeabilizes the plasma membrane to a similar extent as a detergent , Triton X100 . This would suggest that permeabilization of the plasma membrane may be responsible for a proportion of nanoparticle entry into cells . Executive summary • Cells were incubated with 20 nm carboxylate - modified polystyrene nanoparticles in the presence of serum - containing and serum - free media . • Serum - containing media was found to decrease intra - cellular nanoparticle accumulation , primarily through inhibition of cell surface binding . • Clathrin - mediated endocytosis represents a significant route for nanoparticle uptake . • These nanoparticles potentially have the capacity to enter the cell directly through permeabilization of the cell membrane .
