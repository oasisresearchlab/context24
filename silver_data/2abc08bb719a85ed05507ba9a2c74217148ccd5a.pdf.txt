However , a major limitation of endocytic pathway is entrapment of the CPP - cargo in intracellular vesicles from which the cargo must escape into the cytoplasm to exert its biological activity . Here we demonstrate that a CPP tagged with an endosomolytic fusion peptide derived from the inﬂuenza virus hemagglutinin - 2 ( HA2 ) remarkably enhances the cytosolic delivery of proteins in human A549 cells . To determine the endosome - disruptive effects , recombinant DNA plasmids containing coding sequences of HA2 , CPPs and red ﬂuorescent proteins ( RFPs ) were constructed . The fusion proteins were puriﬁed from plasmid - transformed Escherichia coli , and their effects on protein transduction were examined using live cell imaging and ﬂow cytometry . Our data indicate that endocytosis is the major route for cellular internalization of CPP - HA2 - tagged RFP . Mechanistic studies revealed that the fusogenic HA2 peptide dramatically facilitates CPP - mediated protein entry through the release of endocytosed RFPs from endosomes into the cytoplasm . Furthermore , incorporating the HA2 fusion peptide of the CPP - HA2 fusion protein improved cytosolic uptake without causing cytotoxicity . These ﬁndings strongly suggest that the CPP - HA2 tag could be an efﬁcient and safe carrier that overcomes endosomal entrapment of delivered therapeutic drugs . © 2012 Elsevier Inc .

Cell - penetrating peptides ( CPPs ) , also called protein transduction domains ( PTDs ) , are a group of short , highly basic peptides that are able to pene - trate the cell membrane either alone or carried with cargoes [ 9 ] . In 1988 , two groups independently discovered that the transactiva - tor of transcription ( TAT ) protein of the human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) can penetrate cells and activate viral genome replication [ 16 , 21 ] . The process by which TAT protein and other CPPs cross the cell membrane and deliver macromolecule cargoes is referred to as protein transduction [ 11 , 31 , 50 ] . CPPs can be cate - gorized into three groups based upon their composition [ 35 ] . The ﬁrst group is comprised of protein - derived peptides , such as PTD of TAT and antennapedia . The second group includes chimeric pep - tides , such as transportan , that contain two or more motifs from different peptides [ 41 ] . The last group is comprised of synthetic peptides , such as polyarginines [ 17 ] . Although protein transduction has been widely used as a research tool , and twenty clinical trials are now testing 0196 - 9781 / $ – see front matter © 2012 Elsevier Inc .

Liou et al . / Peptides 37 ( 2012 ) 273 – 284 CPP - mediated delivery of drug conjugates in patients with a variety of diseases [ 48 ] , the mechanisms of CPP - mediated cellu - lar uptake and the subsequent intracellular trafﬁcking are still under extensive investigation . Presently , it is believed that most CPPs utilize multiple pathways for cellular entry [ 35 , 37 , 43 , 48 ] . The two major uptake mechanisms of CPPs are direct membrane translocation and endocytosis . Direct membrane translocation , also called direct cell penetration , encompasses a variety of energy - independent pathways , including pore formation , inverted micelle formation , carpet - like model and membrane thinning model [ 35 , 48 ] . Endocytosis is divided into two major categories ; phago - cytosis involves the uptake of large particles while pinocytosis involves solute uptake [ 23 , 35 ] . Pinocytosis can be further divided into macropinocytosis , clathrin - dependent , caveolin - dependent and clathrin / caveolin - independent pathways [ 6 ] . Numerous fac - tors , including the experimental conditions and physicochemical properties of CPPs and their cargoes , appear to inﬂuence the route of cellular uptake [ 35 , 48 ] . Insofar as endocytosis is one of the primary mechanisms for cel - lular delivery mediated by CPPs , the fate of endocytosed cargoes is of paramount importance . Endocytosed cargoes often become trapped in organelles , such as vesicles , endosomes , lysosomes and macropinosomes [ 42 ] , where they may be degraded by hydrolytic enzymes . Thus , escape from endocytic vesicles into the cytoplasm is essential to preserve biological activity of endocytosed cargoes and becomes a limiting factor in the usage of CPPs to deliver bioactive molecules [ 11 , 35 , 43 , 48 , 51 ] . Recently , several endosome - disruptive peptides ( membrane destabilizing / fusion peptides ) were derived from certain pathogens , including viruses and bacterial toxins [ 37 ] . These membrane - disrupting peptides are triggered by endosomal acidiﬁcation and promote endosomal escape [ 12 , 39 , 51 ] . The human inﬂuenza virus is an enveloped virus that contains two major envelope glycoproteins , hemagglutinin ( HA ) and neu - raminidase [ 58 ] . HA is composed of two subunits : hemagglutinin - 1 responsible for binding to cells and hemagglutinin - 2 ( HA2 ) respon - sible for endosomal escape . The N - terminal domain of the HA2 subunit possesses 23 amino acids ( GLFGAIAGFIENGWEGMIDG - WYG ) , a relatively hydrophobic region referred to as fusion peptide [ 7 , 56 ] . This fusion peptide domain is buried in the HA trimer in its resting conformation . Acidiﬁcation in the endosome trig - gers an irreversible conformational change of HA2 , exposing the fusion peptide and allowing it to insert itself into endosomal membranes . Subsequent formation of a fusion pore results in membrane fusion and leading to transfer of viral genome into the cytosol [ 7 ] . The INF7 ( GLFEAIEGFIENGWEGMIDGWYG ) pep - tide , a glutamic acid - enriched HA2 analog , was identiﬁed as a more potent endosome membrane - destabilizing peptide [ 40 ] . In this peptide , two glutamic acid moieties ( underlined in peptide sequence ) were introduced into the original HA2 fusion peptide to extend the (cid:2) - helix structure , thereby increasing pH sensitivity [ 14 ] . HA2 was used to enhance CPP - mediated endosomal escape of cargoes [ 13 , 18 , 28 – 30 , 36 , 45 , 46 , 51 , 61 , 62 ] . Certain delivered molecules are intended to target nucleus . Molecules can enter the nucleus from the cytoplasm by both passive diffusion and active transport mechanisms [ 10 ] . Small molecules less than 10 nm in diameter or 50 – 60 kDa in size can diffuse through nuclear pore complexes [ 50 ] . Most protein molecules are transported by energy - dependent transport mecha - nisms mediated by nuclear localization signals ( NLS ) . These signals are recognized by importin family proteins that mediate the trans - port across the nuclear envelope with the participation of Ran - GTP [ 10 ] . The goals in the present study were to ( 1 ) compare the trans - duction efﬁciency of CPP - , HA2 - and / or NLS - tagged red ﬂuorescent proteins ( RFPs ) and ( 2 ) determine the uptake mechanisms and subcellular localization of these proteins . To achieve these goals , Table 1 Sequences of tags . Tag Amino acid sequence ( single letter code ) HA2 ( INF7 ) GLFEAIEGFIENGWEGMIDGWYG 6His HHHHHH NLS PKKKRKV R9 RRRRRRRRR we ﬁrst constructed a series of novel DNA plasmids containing coding sequences of CPP , HA2 and / or NLS fused RFP . These plas - mids were expressed in bacteria , and the transduction efﬁciency of these fusion proteins was determined in human lung cancer A549 cells using live cell imaging and ﬂow cytometry . To elucidate the uptake mechanisms , pharmacological and physical inhibitors were used to block cellular uptake processes . We found that uptake of CPP - HA2 - tagged RFP involves energy - dependent endocytosis . This study with constructed CPP - containing plasmids reveals valuable mechanistic insights into how these CPPs cause endosomal escape and provides a basis for the design of optimized delivery agents . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Plasmid construction The mCherry plasmid ( kindly provided by Dr . Roger Y . Tsien , University of California , San Diego , CA , USA ) is a prokaryotic expression vector that encodes a hexa - histidine ( 6His ) - tagged monomeric RFP sequence ( Table 1 ) [ 44 ] . The pR9 - mCherry plasmid containing a nona - arginine ( R9 , a CPP ) and HA tag ( YPYDVPDYA ) fused RFP coding region under the control of the T7 promoter was described previously [ 54 ] . This HA tag does not appear to interfere with the bioactivity of recombinant fusion proteins and facilitates the detection , isolation and puriﬁcation of many protein fusions [ 47 ] . The pR9 - HA2 - mCherry plasmid consisting of an R9 and HA2 ( INF7 ) fused RFP coding sequence was constructed by the annealing and digestion of two overlapping primers ( HA2 - U [ 5 (cid:3) - TTAGATCTAGGCCTATTCGAGGCAATAGAAGGTTTCATAGAAAATGG - TTGGGA - 3 (cid:3) , with the Bgl II site underlined ] and HA2 - D [ 5 (cid:3) - TTGGATCCCCGTACCAACCGTCTATCATTCCCTCCCAACCATTTTCTAT - GAAA - 3 (cid:3) , with the Bam HI site underlined ] ) cloned into the Bam HI site of the pR9 - mCherry plasmid . The pR9 - NLS - mCherry plasmid containing an R9 and NLS fused RFP was generated using two overlapping 5 (cid:3) phosphorylated primers ( NLS - U [ 5 (cid:3) - GATCCCAAGAAGAAGAGGAAAGTC - 3 (cid:3) ] and NLS - D [ 5 (cid:3) - GATCGACTTTCCTCTTCTTCTTGG - 3 (cid:3) ] ) cloned into the Bam HI site of the pR9 - mCherry plasmid . The pR9 - HA2 - NLS - mCherry plasmid consisting of an R9 , HA2 and NLS fused RFP was constructed by cloning the NLS - U / D fragment at the Bam HI site of the pR9 - HA2 - mCherry plasmid . All constructs were conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing . 2 . 2 . Protein puriﬁcation and characterization Protein expression and puriﬁcation were as described pre - viously with modiﬁcations [ 3 , 27 ] . All plasmid constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli KRX strain ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) . Bacteria were grown to OD 600 = 0 . 4 and then induced with 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) rhamnose ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) overnight at 37 ◦ C . Expressed proteins were puriﬁed by metal chela - tion chromatography . The binding ( 5 mM imidazole , 0 . 5 M NaCl , 20 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 9 ) and wash ( 80 mM imidazole , 0 . 5 M NaCl , 20 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 9 ) buffers were used during puriﬁcation . Puriﬁed proteins were concentrated as well as dialyzed using Ami - con Ultra - 4 centrifugal ﬁlter devices ( Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) and quantiﬁed by a protein assay kit ( Bio - Rad , Hercule , CA , USA ) . J . - S . Liou et al . / Peptides 37 ( 2012 ) 273 – 284 275 Luminescent images of proteins were captured using the Typhoon FLA 9000 Biomolecular Imager ( GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) with the excitation wavelength at 532 nm for RFPs [ 32 ] . Emission spectra of RFPs were evaluated using an EnSpire 2300 Multilabel Reader ( PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA , USA ) with excitation at 488 nm and emission varying from 510 to 700 nm . 2 . 3 . Protein transduction , subcellular colocalization and mechanistic assays Human lung carcinoma A549 cells ( American Type Culture Col - lection , Manassas , VA , USA ; CCL - 185 ) were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) 1640 medium ( Gibco , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) containing phenol red supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) bovine serum ( Gibco ) , as previously described [ 54 ] . To deter - mine the optimal concentration for protein transduction , cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 5 cells per 35 - mm petri dish and then incubated overnight in 1 ml of growth medium . Cells were washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and then treated with various proteins at the ﬁnal concentrations of 1 , 5 , 10 , 30 and 60 (cid:3) M in RPMI 1640 medium with neither phenol red nor serum at 37 ◦ C for 1 h . Cells were washed ﬁve times with PBS to remove free proteins . To determine subcellular colocalization , cells were treated with 30 (cid:3) M of various proteins for different durations ( 30 min , 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 and 24 h ) in RPMI medium with neither phenol red nor serum at 37 ◦ C . Cells were washed with PBS for ﬁve times to remove free proteins followed by staining with ﬂuorescent organelle - speciﬁc trackers [ 27 ] . Hoechst 33342 , LysoSensor Green DND - 153 ( Invit - rogen ) and ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) mouse anti - human early endosome antigen 1 protein ( EEA1 ) antibody ( BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) were utilized to visualize nuclei , lyso - somes and early endosomes , respectively . Fluorescent images were detected using a BD Pathway 435 System ( BD Biosciences ) . To conduct energy - dependent uptake experiments , cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 ◦ C at which temperature energy - dependent molecular movement in the cell membrane is essentially arrested [ 49 ] . Cells were then treated with 30 (cid:3) M of R9 - HA2 - mCherry at 4 ◦ C for 6 h followed by staining with Hoechst 33342 for 40 min and LysoSensor trackers for 30 min . The inﬂuence of modulators that inhibit or enhance uptake processes was studied in cells treated without or with cytochalasin D ( CytD ) , nocodazole [ 33 ] or chloroquine ( Sigma – Aldrich ) [ 60 ] . Cells were pretreated in the absence or presence of 10 (cid:3) M of CytD , 10 (cid:3) M of nocodazole or 25 (cid:3) M of chloroquine at 37 ◦ C for 30 min . These cells were then treated with 30 (cid:3) M of R9 - HA2 - mCherry in the absence or presence of CytD or nocodazole at 37 ◦ C for 6 h , or chloroquine for 12 h fol - lowed by staining with Hoechst 33342 and LysoSensor trackers . To test any synergistic effect of the HA2 and chloroquine combination [ 57 ] , cells were pretreated in the absence or presence of chloro - quine at 37 ◦ C for 30 min . These cells were then treated with 30 (cid:3) M of R9 - mCherry or R9 - HA2 - mCherry in the absence or presence of chloroquine for 12 h . To assess the CPP - HA2 - mediated cargo delivery , cells were treated with collagen - ﬂuorescein ( Sigma – Aldrich ) [ 23 ] , R9 - HA2 - mCherry or R9 - HA2 - mCherry / collagen - ﬂuorescein complexes at various ratios . Fluorescent images were detected using a BD Path - way 435 System ( BD Biosciences ) . 2 . 4 . Confocal and ﬂuorescent microscopy Fluorescent and bright - ﬁeld live cell images were recorded using a BD Pathway 435 System ( BD Biosciences ) equipped with the Olympus 20 × and 60 × oil objectives ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) [ 27 ] . This system includes both confocal and ﬂuorescent microscopy sets . Excitation ﬁlters were set at 377 / 50 nm , 482 / 35 nm and 543 / 22 nm for blue , green and red ﬂuorescence , respectively . Emis - sion ﬁlters were set at 435LP ( long - pass ) , 536 / 40 nm and 593 / 40 nm for blue ( BFP ) , green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) and RFP channels , respectively . Transmitted light with the 536 / 40 nm emission ﬁlter was used to observe cell morphology as bright - ﬁeld images . 2 . 5 . Flow cytometric analysis A549 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 5 cells per well in 24 - well plates and then incubated overnight in 500 (cid:3) l / well of cul - ture medium . Cells were treated with ﬁve proteins for designated durations ( 1 , 5 , 10 , 30 , 60 min , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 and 24 h ) in RPMI medium with neither phenol red nor serum at 37 ◦ C and then washed ﬁve times with PBS . Cells were analyzed using a Cytomics FC500 Flow Cytometer ( Beckman Coulter , Fullerton , CA , USA ) , as previously described [ 24 ] . For RFP detection , excitation was set at 488 nm and emission at 615 nm with a FL3 ﬁlter . Results are reported as the percentage of the total cell population . 2 . 6 . Cytotoxicity assay A549 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 10 4 cells in 96 - well plates and incubated overnight in 200 (cid:3) l / well of growth medium . Cells were treated with 1 , 5 , 10 , 30 and 60 (cid:3) M of ﬁve proteins in RPMI medium without phenol red nor serum , washed with PBS , and cultured in RPMI medium without serum at 37 ◦ C for 24 h . Cells were treated with PBS as a negative control and 70 % alcohol as a positive control . Cytotoxicity was assessed by the ability of the cells to reduce 1 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 3 , 5 - diphenylformazan ( MTT ) [ 23 , 54 ] . MTT absorbance was measured at 570 nm wave - length using a Model 680 Microplate Reader ( Bio - Rad ) . 2 . 7 . Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation . Mean val - ues and standard deviations were calculated from at least three independent experiments carried out in triplicates in each group . Statistical comparisons between the control and treated groups were performed by the Student t - test , using levels of statistical signiﬁcance of P < 0 . 05 ( * , † , ‡ ) and 0 . 01 ( * * , †† , ‡‡ ) , as indicated . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . RFP - fusion protein analysis To examine the endosomolytic effect of HA2 , we constructed several CPP - containing RFP expression plasmids ( Fig . 1 ) . The mCherry , R9 - mCherry , R9 - HA2 - mCherry , R9 - NLS - mCherry , and R9 - HA2 - NLS - mCherry proteins were overexpressed and puriﬁed in E . coli KRX strain transformed with the relevant plasmids . These plasmids produced 6His - tagged RFP alone or in - frame fused RFPs with a combination of R9 , HA2 and NLS ( Table 1 ) under the control of the T7 promoter . SDS - PAGE analysis of puriﬁed mCherry , R9 - mCherry , R9 - HA2 - mCherry , R9 - NLS - mCherry and R9 - HA2 - NLS - mCherry fusion proteins was detected by a luminescent imager ( Fig . 2A ) or by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue ( Fig . 2B ) . The ﬁve puriﬁed recombinant RFPs have calculated molec - ular masses of 30 . 6 – 36 . 4 kDa . Luminescent scan revealed emission spectra of the ﬂuorescent RFPs ( Fig . 3 ) . All RFPs had maximal emis - sion at about 610 nm upon excitation at 488 nm , indicating that the ﬂuorescent property of the RFP - fusion proteins is not compromised by the addition of peptide tags to the original RFP . 276 J . - S .

Protein transduction efﬁciency of RFPs To determine the optimal concentration for protein transduc - tion , human A549 cells were treated with various concentrations of mCherry , R9 - mCherry or R9 - HA2 - mCherry proteins for 1 h . No ﬂu - orescent signal was detected by ﬂow cytometric analysis in the cells treated with mCherry ( Fig . 4 ) . Red ﬂuorescent signal was observed in the cells treated with R9 - mCherry at the concentration of 60 (cid:3) M , which is consistent with our previous results [ 2 , 24 , 34 , 54 ] . Remark - ably , the cells treated with ≥ 1 (cid:3) M of R9 - HA2 - mCherry exhibited signiﬁcantly higher ﬂuorescence intensity than those treated with equivalent concentrations of mCherry or R9 - mCherry . The inten - sity of the ﬂuorescent signal in R9 - HA2 - mCherry treated cells was concentration - dependent . Measurements of protein transduction were obtained by confocal imaging . A549 cells were treated with a series of concentrations of mCherry ( Fig . 5A ) , R9 - mCherry ( Fig . 5B ) or R9 - HA2 - mCherry ( Fig . 5C ) proteins for 30 min , stained with Hoechst 33342 and then imaged . The imaging data were in good accordance with the above results of ﬂow cytometric analysis , con - ﬁrming that HA2 tag is able to remarkably increase CPP - mediated protein transduction activity . After 30 min , R9 - HA2 - mCherry was primarily located around the inner perimembraneous area . Accord - ing to Figures 4 and 5 , 30 (cid:3) M of ﬂuorescent proteins were chosen as the optimal concentration for subsequent experiments due to more clear and consistent images . 3 . 3 . Time course analysis of CPP - HA2 - mediated protein transduction To understand the kinetics of protein transduction , cells were treated with mCherry , R9 - mCherry , R9 - HA2 - mCherry , R9 - NLS - mCherry or R9 - HA2 - NLS - mCherry ﬂuorescent proteins , and cellular uptake of proteins was measured at various time points by ﬂow cytometry . The cells treated with R9 - HA2 - mCherry at 5 min showed higher red ﬂuorescent intensity than the cells treated with the other four proteins ( Fig . 6A ) . The fraction of the Fig . 2 .

Images were recorded using a BD pathway system at a magniﬁcation of 200 × .

Time course analysis of CPP - HA2 - mediated protein transduction . Cells were treated with 30 (cid:3) M of mCherry , R9 - mCherry , R9 - HA2 - mCherry , R9 - NLS - mCherry or R9 - HA2 - NLS - mCherry for short ( 1 , 5 , 10 , 30 and 60 min ) ( A ) and long ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 and 24 h ) ( B ) periods of time and then analyzed by a ﬂow cytometer . Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments . R9 - HA2 - mCherry treated cells with ﬂuorescence continued to increase over time . At 1 h , the R9 - HA2 - mCherry group showed 80 times higher protein uptake than the other groups . When the time point was extended to 18 h , the uptake of R9 - mCherry , R9 - HA2 - mCherry , R9 - NLS - mCherry and R9 - HA2 - NLS - mCherry ﬂuorescent proteins reached about 90 % of all cells ( Fig . 6B ) . These results conﬁrm that HA2 peptide accelerates endosomolytic activity to increase CPP - mediated protein transduction . Moreover , NLS tags seemed to inhibit HA2 enhancement of protein transduction . To study the endosomolytic ability of HA2 , cells were treated with mCherry , R9 - mCherry , R9 - HA2 - mCherry , R9 - NLS - mCherry or R9 - HA2 - NLS - mCherry proteins for 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 and 24 h , stained with organelle - speciﬁc green ﬂuorescent markers and then analyzed by confocal microscopy . No red ﬂuorescence could be detected in the cells treated with mCherry at any time ( Fig . 7A ) . In contrast , the cells treated with R9 - mCherry ( Fig . 7B ) and R9 - NLS - mCherry ( data not shown ) proteins exhibited a time - dependent increase in red ﬂuorescence in the cytoplasm , a few yellow / orangey spots in lysosomes but not the nuclei . Strikingly , the cells treated with R9 - HA2 - mCherry displayed red ﬂuorescence in plasma mem - brane at 1 h , around the inner perimembraneous area at 3 h and throughout the cytosol after 6 h ( Fig . 7C ) . Results from the cells treated with R9 - HA2 - NLS - mCherry ( data not shown ) were simi - lar to those of R9 - HA2 - mCherry treatment , although the uptake was lower . Further , we noticed some yellow / orangey punctate for - mations within the cells treated with R9 - HA2 - mCherry after 6 h ( Fig . 7C and D ) and R9 - HA2 - NLS - mCherry after 12 h ( Fig . 7D ) , sug - gesting that these proteins were associated with lysosomes and endosomes . Together , these results suggest that the pathway of cel - lular internalization of R9 - HA2 - mCherry and R9 - HA2 - NLSmCherry involves endocytosis . The fusogenic HA2 peptide dramatically enhanced CPP - mediated protein transduction apparently by help - ing the escape of RFPs from endosomes into the cytoplasm . 3 . 4 . Energy - dependent mechanism of CPP - HA2 - mediated protein transduction To reveal the mechanistic aspect of R9 - HA2 - mCherry internal - ization , cells were treated with R9 - HA2 - mCherry at 4 ◦ C or 37 ◦ C ( as a control ) for 6 h ( Fig . 8A ) . Low temperature incubation inhib - ited cellular uptake of R9 - HA2 - mCherry ( Fig . 8A and B ) . These data are in agreement with the results in Fig . 7C and suggest that pro - tein transduction of R9 - HA2 - mCherry involves energy - dependent endocytosis . To examine the molecular aspect of endocytic processes , cells were treated with R9 - mCherry or R9 - HA2 - mCherry in the absence or presence of CytD , nocodazole or chloroquine . Both endo - cytic inhibitors , CytD and nocodazole , disrupted cellular uptake of R9 - HA2 - mCherry ( Fig . 8B ) . The lysosomotropic agent chloro - quine further enhanced the cellular uptake of R9 - HA2 - mCherry compared to that of R9 - mCherry ( Fig . 8C and D ) . However , the com - bination of chloroquine and HA2 fusion peptide did not produce a synergistic increase of protein transduction ( Fig . 8D ) . 3 . 5 . MTT - based cell viability assay To assess cytotoxicity caused by CPPs tagged with HA2 and / or NLS in eukaryotes , A549 cells were treated with mCherry , R9 - mCherry , R9 - HA2 - mCherry , R9 - NLS - mCherry or R9 - HA2 - NLS - mCherry proteins for 24 h and then analyzed by the MTT reduction assay ( Fig . 9 ) . Cells treated with PBS and 70 % alcohol were used as negative and positive controls , respectively . Cells treated with 1 , 5 , 10 , 30 and 60 (cid:3) M of any of RFP - fusion proteins did not display cytotoxicity . 3 . 6 . CPP - HA2 - based cargo delivery To assess that the CPP - HA2 - mediated protein transduction is applicable in cargo delivery , collagen - ﬂuorescein previously used as a ﬂuorescence - labeled protein cargo in our transdermal study [ 23 ] was served as one of examples . A549 cells were treated with collagen - ﬂuorescein alone , R9 - HA2 - mCherry or R9 - HA2 - mCherry / collagen - ﬂuorescein complexes and analyzed by confocal microscopy . No green ﬂuorescence could be detected in the cells treated with collagen - ﬂuorescein ( Fig . 10 ) . In contrast , the cells treated with R9 - HA2 - mCherry and R9 - HA2 - mCherry / collagen - ﬂuorescein complexes in different ratios displayed red and red / green ﬂuorescence , respectively .

Discussion In this report , we demonstrate that the endosomolytic HA2 tag increases cellular uptake , accelerates endosomal escape and pro - motes even cytosolic distribution of endocytosed CPP - containing RFPs in human A549 cells . We constructed a series of plasmids con - taining coding sequences of CPP , HA2 and / or NLS fused RFP . These plasmids were expressed in bacteria , and the uptake of the puri - ﬁed proteins was measured in A549 cells . Live cell imaging and ﬂow cytometry revealed mechanistic details of cellular uptake and endosomolytic activity . Our results indicate that ( 1 ) endocytosis is the major route for cellular uptake of CPP - HA2 - tagged RFP , ( 2 ) the endosomolytic HA2 peptide promotes the escape of RFPs from endosomes into the cytoplasm and ( 3 ) incorporating the HA2 fusion peptide of the CPP - HA2 fusion protein improves cytosolic uptake . Recent studies indicated that poor intracellular trafﬁcking and limited endosomal release are major factors reducing the efﬁciency of protein transduction [ 11 , 35 , 43 , 48 , 51 ] . CPP - cargo trapped in endosomes or macropinosomes can be released into the cytosol by membrane perturbation , such as that induced by the INF7 peptide ( a glutamic acid - enriched HA2 analog ) [ 13 , 18 , 28 , 36 , 45 , 46 , 61 , 62 ] . Contrarily , a recent report showed that the glutamate - rich HA2 analog E5 tags can lyse endosomes , while HA2 - protein ( E5 - TAT - mCherry ) conjugates may remain associated with lysed endosomes [ 30 ] . In this case , HA2 causes the retention of its fused protein inside endosomes without the diffusion into the cytoplasm even after endosomal lysis takes place [ 30 ] . Our results show that R9 - HA2 - mCherry has the highest protein uptake efﬁciency among ﬁve RFPs examined ( Figs . 4 – 6 ) . Subcellular colocalization and mechanistic studies of CPP - mediated protein internalization indicate that the HA2 tag promotes the escape of RFPs from endosomes into the cyto - plasm ( Figs . 7 and 8 ) . Together , we conclude that the incorporation of fusogenic HA2 facilitates endosomal disruption and increases cellular internalization of R9 - HA2 - mCherry . Studies have used the vacuolating toxin VacA to depict a typical endocytosis timeline . The process requires dynamic F - actin struc - tures on early endosomes for trafﬁcking to late endosomes in HeLa cells [ 19 , 20 ] . The pinocytosis of VacA involves four steps : ( 1 ) bind - ing of VacA to the cell by a Rac - dependent process , ( 2 ) accumulation of VacA into early endosomes within 10 min in a Cdc42 - dependent nonmacropinocytic manner , ( 3 ) enrichment of VacA in the early endosomes within 30 min and ( 4 ) transfer of VacA from early to late endosomes within 120 min . According to reports on VacA and related compounds [ 15 , 19 , 20 , 22 ] , our studies of kinetics , molecu - lar mechanisms of uptake and subcellular localization suggest that endosomal disruption caused by HA2 of R9 - HA2 - mCherry occurs within 0 . 5 – 2 h ( Figs . 6 – 8 ) . Our study informed quick endosomal release of R9 - HA2 - mCherry compared to the other four proteins ( Fig . 6 ) . Rapid escape from endosomes may preserve biological activity of delivered cargoes . A report of N - stearylated NLS sug - gested an enhancement of the CPP - mediated transfection activity by overcoming limitations of cell membrane and nuclear pores [ 53 ] . Contrarily , our limited data from the constructs with the NLS tag seemed to suggest a possible interference of the NLS tag with the HA2 - enhanced protein transduction at the relatively early time points . The details of this NLS interference remained to be eluci - dated . Despite the broad acceptance of CPPs as molecular carriers , the cellular uptake mechanism of CPPs and CPP - cargo is still under vigorous investigation [ 35 , 37 , 43 , 48 ] . The internalization of R9 - HA2 - mCherry was inhibited by incubation at 4 ◦ C and by CytD as well as nocodazole , indicating that the intracellular delivery of R9 - HA2 - mCherry involves energy - dependent endocytosis ( Fig . 8B ) . Chloroquine , a lysosomotropic agent that prevents endosomal acidiﬁcation and the degradation by lysosomal enzymes , is often used to improve the efﬁciency of the gene delivery in laboratory studies [ 37 , 60 ] . The combination of chloroquine and INF7 - SGSC peptide caused a synergistic increase of polylysine - mediated DNA J . - S . Liou et al . / Peptides 37 ( 2012 ) 273 – 284 283 transfection activity in human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) 293 cells [ 57 ] . Our data indicate that chloroquine increases the cellular uptake of R9 - HA2 - mCherry ( Fig . 8C and D ) in a non - synergistic manner . CPPs are very attractive , noncytotoxic candidates for affect - ing the delivery of therapeutic macromolecules , such as proteins and nucleic acids [ 12 , 42 , 48 , 51 ] . The safety of most CPPs has been conﬁrmed in a detailed metabolic analysis [ 26 ] . Our data demon - strate that CPPs do not compromise membrane integrity nor result in cytotoxicity of A549 cells as indicated by trypan blue [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 23 , 54 , 55 ] , MTT [ 5 , 23 , 55 ] , MTS [ 59 ] and sulforhodamine B ( SRB ) [ 24 , 27 , 32 , 33 ] assays . Previous studies used CPPs at 0 . 1 (cid:3) M for 2 h [ 36 ] , 1 – 20 (cid:3) M for 3 – 24 h [ 28 , 62 ] , 20 – 50 (cid:3) M for 1 – 2 h [ 38 ] or 0 – 100 (cid:3) M for 6 – 24 h [ 45 , 46 ] for fusion protein treat - ment . Further , the usages of CPP concentrations at or less than 100 (cid:3) M did not cause cytotoxicity [ 25 ] . Together , these ﬁndings suggest the HA2 fusion peptide as an effective and safe trig - ger to enhance protein transduction activity . However , the HA2 fusion peptide located at the N - terminus of CPP - fusion proteins has been reported to be cytotoxic [ 28 , 38 , 45 , 62 ] . HA2 - TAT [ 45 , 62 ] , E5 - TAT [ 28 ] ( 5 (cid:3) M ) and N - E5L [ 38 ] ( 100 (cid:3) M ) caused cytotoxic - ity , while HA2 - p53 - R9 [ 36 ] ( 0 . 1 (cid:3) M ) and stearylated INF7 [ 13 ] did not . Further , chemically synthesized HA2 - R9 peptide with HA2 at the N - terminus exerted a certain degree of cytotoxicity at high concentrations in eukaryotes ( manuscript in preparation ) . Due to data limitation , the true effect of HA2 located at either N - or C - terminus of fusion protein remains unknown . It is impor - tant to note that the E5 - TAT - mCherry construct was successfully expressed in E . coli by blocking the N - terminus of the fusion pro - tein with a cleavable SUMO ( small ubiquitin - related modiﬁer ) tag [ 30 ] . This SUMO tag can be removed by the SUMO protease to obtain an N - terminal glycine residue of the E5 sequence after puriﬁcation of E5 - TAT - mCherry protein . We therefore conjectured that protein with HA2 tagged at the extreme N - terminus may be membrane - lytic or membrane - active [ 36 , 52 ] . It is possible that strong lytic ( including endosomolytic ) activities of HA2 have been reduced by addition of tags to the N - terminus of HA2 . This is a big advantage of our CPP - HA2 - tagged proteins with increased plasma membrane association and possibly greater endocytic uptake , because other HA2 - fusion proteins have shown much higher toxicity [ 28 , 38 , 45 , 62 ] . In order to ascertain whether RFP - fusion proteins cause cytotox - icity during protein transduction , we performed the MTT toxicity test in human A549 cells ( Fig . 9 ) . None to very minimal cytotox - icity was observed with any of the ﬁve RFPs at concentrations up to 30 (cid:3) M . When collagen - ﬂuorescein was used as a cargo , our results demonstrated that the CPP - HA2 - mediated protein trans - duction system is applicable in cargo delivery into cells ( Fig . 10 ) . These results suggest that CPP tagged with a HA2 fusion peptide at the C - terminus is a relatively safe design for protein transduction promoting agents . 5 . Conclusion Endocytosis is the major route for cellular uptake of CPP - HA2 - tagged RFP . The fusogenic HA2 tag facilitates the release of endocytosed RFPs from endosomes into the cytoplasm resulting in a diffuse cytosolic distribution . Remarkably , incor - porating the HA2 fusion peptide of the CPP - HA2 fusion protein improved cytosolic uptake without causing cytotoxicity . R9 - HA2 - mCherry was capable of delivering collagen - ﬂuorescein into cells . Collectively , these results indicate that the CPP - HA2 tag could be an efﬁcient and safe carrier of biologically active molecules . Acknowledgements We thank Dr . Roger Y .
