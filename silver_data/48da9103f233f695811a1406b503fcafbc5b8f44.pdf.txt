TM will be successful only if the individuals , often patients with medical conditions , are willing to accept and adopt it in their daily lives . This study aimed to determine the prevalence of willingness of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and / or hypertension towards the use of TM , and the factors influencing their uptake . Methods : A cross - sectional survey was conducted at two public primary care clinics ( polyclinics ) in north - eastern Singapore , where TM had not been implemented . After the patients with T2DM and / or hypertension consented after fulfilling the eligibility criteria , they were first introduced to the concept of TM using pictogram and explanation by the investigators . Data on their demography , clinical parameters , technological literacy and acceptance of TM based on the Health Information Technology Acceptance Model ( HITAM ) were subsequently collected , computed , analyzed , followed by regression analyses to identify the factors associated with their willingness to use TM . Results : Among 1125 eligible multi - ethnic Asian patients approached , 899 of them completed the assisted questionnaire survey , yielding a response rate of 79 . 9 % . Their mean age was 58 ± 8 years , females 51 . 3 % and Chinese 69 . 3 % . Overall , 53 . 0 % of the patients were willing to use TM . Personal beliefs on technology ( OR = 3 . 54 , 95 % CI = 2 . 50 – 4 . 50 , p < 0 . 001 ) , prior technology utility ( OR = 3 . 18 , 95 % CI = 1 . 57 – 6 . 42 , p = 0 . 001 ) , Patient ’ s requirements to be accompanied ( OR = 1 . 48 , 95 % CI = 1 . 054 – 2 . 082 , P = 0 . 03 ) Cost considerations ( OR = 2 . 96 , 95 % CI = 2 . 257 – 3 . 388 , P < 0 . 01 ) and technological literacy ( OR = 2 . 77 , 95 % CI = 2 . 05 – 3 . 38 , p < 0 . 001 ) were associated with willingness to use TM . Conclusion : Slightly over half of the patients were willing to use TM . Factors such as age , ethnicity , technological literacy , beliefs and previous utility of technology of the patients have to be addressed before implementing TM in primary care .

BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2020 ) 20 : 11 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s12911 - 020 - 1024 - 4 Background Telemedicine or Telehealth is the delivery of health - care services remotely by means of telecommunica - tions technology [ 1 , 2 ] . Tele - monitoring ( TM is a method of remote monitoring of vital parameters by persons outside of healthcare setting ( such as from their residences ) , which are transmitted electronically via blue tooth technology to the healthcare provider [ 3 – 8 ] . Leveraging on TM to check on the clinical status of patients with non - communicable diseases ( NCD ) such as Type 2 Diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and hypertension in the community is of particular significance and relevance to their optimal long term management . The global prevalence of NCD is in - creasing rapidly . T2DM was estimated to be 9 % in 2014 , contributing to 1 . 5 million deaths and 89 mil - lion disability - adjusted life - years ( DALYS ) [ 9 ] . Global prevalence for hypertension was even higher at over 22 % , leading to 9 . 4 million deaths [ 1 , 9 ] . There is thus an urgent need to curb the rising morbidity and mortality from these NCD . Traditional model of care for NCD is episodic . Physicians review patients during face - to - face consultations but do not have access to their clinical status in between consul - tations . Patients may develop complications as a re - sult of events or occurrences that go unnoticed or unattended to during this interval , resulting in missed opportunities for early intervention to prevent adverse outcomes . Optimal glycaemic and blood pressure ( BP ) control are critical in preventing vascular complications and mortality . Regular monitoring of these vital parame - ters via TM allows patients to gain better insights into their real - time diabetes and hypertension control in relation to their treatment . TM has shown to be beneficial for chronic disease management [ 3 – 8 ] such as in Diabetes mellitus management in children , out - comes in women with gestational Diabetes Mellitus , in management of uncontrolled hypertension and paired with self - monitoring of blood pressure . In addition , any abnormal health status trend detected via TM can alert the patients and their care pro - viders , enabling them to take remedial measures to prevent complications . Thus , TM extends the scope of patient monitoring beyond the clinical setting , which is important for surveillance of NCD such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension . Acceptance and adoption of TM is pivotal in achieving its objectives . Despite its potential to com - plement traditional model of care , the benefits of TM can only be reaped if there is sufficient uptake by pa - tients themselves . Theoretical frameworks have been developed to assess the acceptance of technology im - plementation in healthcare , one of which is the Health Information Technology Acceptance Model ( HITAM ) [ 10 ] . This framework takes into account be - havioural beliefs , normative beliefs and efficacy belief , leading to the concepts of perceived threat , usefulness and ease of use respectively . Understanding and addressing the barriers towards the use of TM is necessary for its successful implementation . Known deterrents of TM include older age , lower educa - tion , patients ’ beliefs , concerns about the costs and privacy , and preferences for face - to - face consultations [ 11 – 16 ] . These factors are influenced by the socioeconomic , psychological and cultural context of the local popula - tion . Located at the centre of Southeast Asia , Singapore has an urbanised , Western - educated multi - ethnic Asian population with one of the highest pene - trance of info - communication technology in the world [ 17 , 18 ] . Nonetheless , a local study in 2008 reported that only 40 . 3 % of patients , who were managed in public primary care centres ( polyclinics ) , were willing to use communication technologies in healthcare ser - vices , namely Short Message Service ( SMS ) and inter - net [ 19 ] . Patients ’ personal beliefs and technological literacy were the main factors which influenced their acceptance of a technology - based healthcare system . However , we postulated that the level of acceptance of TM would have risen since 2008 , as info - communication technology has advanced significantly over the last decade to mitigate some of the barriers . The need to re - evaluate the acceptability and per - ceptions of TM in Singapore is imminent , in view of rising prevalence of NCD such as T2DM and hyper - tension , and a shrinking workforce to support its rap - idly aging population [ 20 ] . In the last 10 years , complexity of technology , access to technology , health behaviors and the medico - legal landscape have signifi - cantly evolved [ 21 ] . . Population demographics and healthcare needs in Singapore have also evolved in the past decade , with an aging population increasingly consisting of more educated and self - reliant middle - aged population , and a shift in focus from tertiary and acute care to preventive and primary care in the community . Since 2008 , there have been greater inte - gration of technology and healthcare such as through E - appointments , E - payment , Teleradiology at the in - stitution where the study was executed . However , technology can be expensive . With rising number of people living with chronic diseases , increasing healthcare cost and increasing evidence to support the use of tele - monitoring in patients with non - communicable diseases , a re - evaluation of the acceptability and perceptions of Tele - monitoring in Singapore is timely to support its imple - mentation successfully in the community , so as to maximize the use of scarce healthcare manpower and re - sources . . TM is a potential tool to maximise the healthcare Sin et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2020 ) 20 : 11 Page 2 of 11 manpower to manage these NCD and to engage the respective patients in self - management to optimise disease control and alleviate the rising disease burden . Thus the study aimed to determine the prevalence of willingness and associated factors in the use of TM by patients who consulted the polyclinics for their T2DM and / or hypertension management . It takes into consideration that patients have varying levels of un - derstanding of tele - monitoring , and that tele - monitoring interventions , with the potential to be wide - ranging , are grounded by similar concepts . Method Study design A cross - sectional observational study was conducted using interviewer - administered questionnaires . The question - naires consists of 3 segments . First , information was col - lected on patients ’ biodata , perceptions towards medical conditions , self - monitoring behaviours , accessibility to technology and technological literacy , underpinned by the Health Information Technology Acceptance Model ( HITAM ) [ 10 , 22 – 33 ] . ( Additional file 1 : Questionnaire and Fig . 1 ) . Next , concepts and current TM services were intro - duced to each patient via a scripted explanation and infor - mation pamphlet to ensure a standardised understanding of TM across the study . ( Figure 2 in Appendix ) : education segment . The information were standardized and scripted after close discussion with SingHealth Polyclinics , a major public primary healthcare provider . In the final segment , the willingness to use TM and as - sociated factors were assessed based on the question “ Would you be willing to use tele - monitoring as part of managing your diabetes / hypertension now ? ” Response options to this question were “ Yes ” , “ Sometimes ” , “ No ” , and “ Unsure ” . As TM will require a certain level of com - mitment to work as intended , a “ yes ” response was taken to mean that the patient was willing , while the remaining options were regarded as unwilling . A pilot study was conducted at a clinic to assess the content of the questionnaire as well as the feasibility of its administration . Amendments were made based on the feedbacks and issues identified during the pilot study . The final questionnaire was also translated to mandarin language for ease of administration to the pre - dominant Chinese patient pool in the polyclinics .

BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2020 ) 20 : 11 Page 3 of 11 Study site and population Multi - ethnic Asian patients were recruited from two public primary care clinics ( polyclinics ) located in Pasir Ris and Sengkang in north - eastern Singapore [ 34 ] . In 2015 , the former manages daily attendances of 600 – 700 patients in an estate with a population of 139 , 890 residents . The latter attended to 1000 – 1100 patients daily in an estate populated by 206 , 690 residents . The eligibility criteria for study participants were : aged 21 – 70 years old ; had Type 2 DM and / or hypertension with ≥ 2 follow - up consultations within the past year and were able to converse in English or Mandarin . We ex - cluded patients with prior exposure to TM and / or could not respond to the survey due to language , cognitive , hearing or visual barriers . Recruitment This study used consecutive sampling to recruit suit - able patients . Study team members were stationed at the Health Monitoring Station ( HMS ) in each study site , where all patients on follow - up visits for diabetes and / or hypertension had measurements of their blood pressure and body mass index by trained healthcare workers . Every patient at the HMS from 7 to 15 February 2017 were approached and screened for their eligibility for this study . After queries on the study were addressed , verbal con - sent was obtained from each patient in a private room where the questionnaire survey was conducted . A participant information sheet was provided for all participants . A total of 37 interviewers , comprising final year medical students , underwent rigorous pre - implementation training prior to the study initiation . Every interviewer used the standardized script to admin - ister the questionnaire to ensure consistency . Sample size estimation and statistical analysis Assuming a 3 % error margin and a prevalence of willingness of 66 . 8 % derived from studies done overseas , it was estimated that a total of 944 respon - dents would be required [ 35 – 37 ] . All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics software Version 23 . 0 ( IBM Co . , Armonk , New York , US ) . Descriptive data is presented as counts and in percentages . Bivariate analyses were conducted using the Pearson Chi - Squared Test for categorical variables . To adjust for confounding variables , a lo - gistic regression model was performed on all factors that were significant in the univariate analysis . A p - value of < 0 . 05 was used to determine statistical significance . Ethics approval and funding This study was approved by SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board ( CIRB Ref : 2016 / 3162 ) . Funding for printing of questionnaires and materials was provided by the Yong Loo Lin School of Medi - cine at the National University of Singapore . The in - vestigators declared no conflict of interest in this study . Results Among the 1125 eligible patients who were approached , 899 of them consented and completed the survey , yield - ing a response rate of 79 . 9 % . The demographic charac - teristics of the study population are presented in Table 1 . Primary study objective : willingness to take - up Tele - monitoring A total of 472 patients ( 52 . 5 % ) were willing to take up TM to manage their condition , regardless of their med - ical conditions . Among the 427 participants who re - ported unwillingness to use TM , 52 . 2 % of them felt that they would be willing after hearing positive reports . Factors associated with willingness to take up Tele - monitoring All socio - demographic characteristics investigated were significantly associated with willingness to take up TM based on univariate analysis . Younger , males , married , minority ethnicity , English speaking , working patients , those with higher education , those with higher income and those without any need for financial assistance were more willing to use TM ( Table 1 ) . Table 2 shows the HITAM related factors which were associated with willingness to use TM . Hand - phone and smartphone ownerships , and self - reported computer skills were associated with increased willingness to use TM . In contrast , patients who set aside more time for polyclinic visits , and those who had concerns about priv - acy violations were less willing to use TM . Results of the multi - variate analysis are presented in Table 3 . Patients who perceived comparable satisfaction between TM and face - to face physician consultation , no privacy violation , cost savings with TM , need accom - paniment for physician visit , were convinced of positive results of TM , and did not face challenges in using com - munication devices , were associated with willingness to take up TM . Discussion Our study revealed a slim majority of our study popula - tion ( 52 . 5 % ) were willing to use TM to manage their NCD . Nonetheless , the willingness to use TM has in - creased compared to 40 . 3 % in the earlier survey [ 19 ] . In Sin et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2020 ) 20 : 11 Page 4 of 11 this study 95 . 1 and 88 . 5 % of patients owned a hand - phone and had access to the internet respectively , versus 71 . 2 and 49 . 4 % in the earlier study . Greater access to mobile technology is postulated to be associated with the rising willingness to use TM . Based on HITAM , ownership of hand - phone ( s ) , usage of smartphone apps and having at least basic computer skills were important ‘ technological ’ factors influencing the use of TM ( Table 2 ) . Those who found “ using com - munication devices challenging ” were less willing to use TM ( Table 3 ) . Nevertheless , over these years , govern - ment agencies have launched programmes , such as the Smart Nation Singapore initiative , to improve the tech - nology literacy of the local population [ 38 ] . Specific ef - forts are directed to equip the elderly with the relevant technological skills through various free or heavily subsi - dized courses and workshops in the community [ 39 ] . The prevalence of willingness to use TM in disease sur - veillance is expected to escalate in the immediate future with these measures to lower the barriers [ 19 ] .

BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2020 ) 20 : 11 Page 6 of 11 Patients who required caregivers to accompany them for their physician consultation were more willing to use TM . Convenience is likely the major attributing factor . For stable patients who are diligently monitoring their clinical parameters , TM could potentially replace a phys - ician visit but safety has to be evaluated more stringently with appropriately designed trial . The healthcare infra - structure must also be able to document their health sta - tus via linkage to the electronic health records and support the continuity and timely supply of their medi - cations . However , TM should not be confused with tele - consultation . It should remain as an adjunct tool to sup - port patients in their chronic disease management . Individual beliefs and perceptions of TM in healthcare also influence a patient ’ s willingness to use TM . Patients were more willing to use TM if they were shown re - ported evidences of its effectiveness . However , the re - sults showed that patients had other concerns .

BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2020 ) 20 : 11 Page 7 of 11 The fee - for - service healthcare system in Singapore also has implications for the introduction of TM to patients . Patients who consult primary care physicians have to pay for the services and medications . The technology in - volved in TM can be expensive and cost will eventually be passed over to these primary care users . What mat - tered to them seemed to be their perceived cost - savings of using the TM system , as alluded in this study . Cost consideration for adding on TM to a polyclinic consult - ation is inevitable . It is imperative to assess if the popu - lation is ready to pay for the new technology in monitoring their health . Substitution for a face - to - face consultation when clinical parameters from the TM sys - tem are stable and economy of scale when the pool of users expands can potentially lead to cost - savings . Thus , aside from patients , the results of the study will interest the health finance and policy makers to evaluate the feasi - bility and cost - effectiveness of scaling up a TM system to support chronic disease management nation - wide . These factors are potentially modifiable but will re - quire time and intervention to gain public trust . TM has been implemented in isolated private healthcare system in Singapore but the results are not published [ 40 ] . A well - designed randomised controlled trial on TM is be - ing planned in a public primary care institution , which will be able to provide proof of values in terms of satis - faction of TM to the users , its cost - effectiveness and scalability in its implementation . Perception of non - intrusion to personal privacy in using TM is also a key influencing factor . A TM system with secured data encryption , data repository and re - stricted access when transmitting patient data to health - care providers [ 41 ] is essential for its implementation [ 42 ] . . Privacy protection is especially critical where mul - tiple incidences of data breaches in local healthcare sys - tems were recently reported [ 43 , 44 ] . Local healthcare providers have to work closely with the official IT gov - erning agencies to ensure strict adherence to measures which have since been implemented for personal data protection . The strength of this study lies in the systematic sam - pling of the potential patients , notwithstanding the large daily volumes of patients at the study sites . The results showed that perceptions and beliefs of TM influenced the willingness of its adoption . They are modifiable and can be mitigated with appropriate measures to optimise the successful implementation of TM in primary care . Nonetheless , we acknowledged that self - reported will - ingness to adopt TM might not correspond to actual utility by the patients . The forthcoming trial will provide more objective evidences of TM utilization . Conclusion Our study showed that 52 . 5 % of patients with T2DM and / or hypertension reported willingness to adopt TM . They were influenced by perceived effectiveness ease of use , cost savings , privacy protection , and satis - faction of care using TM compared to face - to - face phys - ician consultation . It is heartening to recognise from the results that the awareness of telemonitoring among pa - tients has increased with the growth and expanding use of technology in our society . A randomised controlled study ( RCT ) is to be implemented soon , to prove effectiveness in health outcomes of the patients recruited into the tele - monitoring system compared with usual care . Beyond the RCT , there are plans to scale up the telemonitoring sys - tem to cater to those who are currently unwilling to use it using implementation science approaches .
