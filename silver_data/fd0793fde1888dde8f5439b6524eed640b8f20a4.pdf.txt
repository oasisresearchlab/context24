INTRODUCTION We present the design and development of i * CATch , a modular , textile - friendly , plug - and - play construction toolkit for wearable and physical computing , designed to support the integration of quick prototyping and rapid engagement into wearable and physical computing , especially for use in education by novices . The focus of computing education has shifted in recent years . The commoditization of computers has resulted in major changes in the discipline . Where computers used to be deployed mainly in high - end engineering , mathematical , or scientiﬁc applications , they are now present in almost all facets of daily life , from work to entertainment . As a result , computing systems are now used by a much more diverse population of users and for much more diverse purposes . For instance , even the arts and aesthetics , which are This work was partially supported by the eToy Laboratory of the Department of Computing , several grants ( project codes 8CGF , G - U529 and 464A ) from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and grant number PolyU - 523511 from the Hong Kong Research Grants Council .

Ngai et al . not traditionally associated with engineering and computing , are increasingly making use of computing technologies . Computing education has responded to this trend by introducing aspects of design , entertainment , and service into the curriculum and the classroom , and many technolo - gies have been brought out of the laboratory and redesigned for use in the classroom , often in the form of educational toolkits that are specially designed for use by novices , students and even children . One of the best examples , perhaps , is that of robotics , as exempliﬁed by the many robotics kits such as VEX [ 2006 ] and Lego Mindstorms’ RCX and NXT sets [ Lego 2006 ] . In addition to robotics , a number of other technologies have also been repurposed as educational technology . The Scratch [ Maloney et al . 2004 ] and Alice [ Conway et al . 2000 ] software kits deploy multimedia and 3D graphics technol - ogy to present computational concepts using drag - and - drop , icon - based programming , enhanced with animation and sound effects . Even though the original purposes of these construction and software kits were to demonstrate and teach computational or engineering concepts , they have come to be used to teach a wide variety of concepts and courses . For example , the Lego Mindstorms kits have been used to teach a multiplicity of science , technology and engineering concepts , ranging from high school physics [ Church et al . 2010 ] to introductory programming [ Lawhead et al . 2003 ] and artiﬁcial intelligence [ Klassner 2002 ] at the college level . Much of the success of these kits in education can be attributed to their ability to present academic concepts in the context of a technology that excites and entertains the students , by abstracting away the low - level complexities and presenting the higher - level concepts in a way that encourages exploration and experimentation . This corroborates the work by Greenberg [ 2007 ] , which states that in addition to putting the technology within easy reach of the general public , well - designed toolkits can also facilitate creativity and innovation successfully in the classroom as well as in the research laboratory . In recent years , tangible interaction and pervasive computing have attracted much interest , in both the research community and the general public . There is much at - traction and appeal in computer systems with which one can interact physically , and the idea of intelligent , interactive environments and fashion is futuristic and exciting . They also have a stronger aesthetic and design element when compared with traditional robotics and programming , and have been proven to be able to attract a new demo - graphic of users and students to computing and engineering [ Buechley and Hill 2010 ] . 2 . CURRENT STATE OF THE ART IN EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES Wearable computing has come a long way from the early constructions that focused on power and functionality . Those early constructions were essentially portable computers augmented with peripheral sensors for applications such as body monitoring in medi - cal or military contexts . An example is the Georgia Tech Wearable Motherboard [ Park et al . 2002 ] , which was developed for military use and demonstrated the concept of per - sonalized mobile information processing ( PMIP ) in the context of pervasive / invisible computing . These systems incorporated a lot of computing power and functionality , but did not aim to be aesthetically attractive . More recently , though , there has been an additional focus on wearable computing as a vehicle for aesthetics , interaction , and per - sonal expression [ Berzowska 2005 ] . Previous works [ Orth et al . 1998 ; Post et al . 2000 ] have introduced fabric computing interfaces that use sewn fabric sensors and circuits to eliminate uncomfortable and heavy wires , connectors and electronics . The e - Tags [ Lehn et al . 2004 ] and Electric Suspenders [ Gorlick 1999 ] work developed innovative meth - ods for introducing reconﬁgurability and for embedding electronic communications and power supply into textiles . ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . Designing i * CATch : A Multipurpose , Education - Friendly Construction Kit 7 : 3 Many of the recent developments in the ﬁeld of wearable computing have been aimed at “democratizing” the ﬁeld by providing a low - cost , low - threshold entry point that allows enthusiasts to experiment with technology that was previously available only in laboratories . The Arduino LilyPad [ Buechley et al . 2008 ] , for example , provides a set of low - cost , easy - to - use controllers and sensors with a form factor speciﬁcally for wearable computing and e - textiles . This was complemented by related work and experience sharing from various sources [ Post et al . 2000 ; Buechley and Eisenberg 2009 ; Katterfeldt et al . 2009 ; Church et al . 2010 ] , which moved wearable computing further into the realm of tangible interactivity and artistry . The TeeBoard [ Ngai et al . 2009 ] went one step further by eliminating the need for formerly indispensible low - level skills , such as sewing and ironing , and facilitated the use of wearable computing as an educational and outreach tool for engineering and computing . These efforts have made it possible and inspired others to incorporate wearable computing technology into educational activities [ Katterfeldt et al . 2009 ; Buechley and Eisenberg 2009 ] . There has also been similar work in physical computing and tangible interaction . The Phidgets [ Greenberg and Fitchett 2001 ] series , which focuses on exploration and quick prototyping , consists of a set of modules that are meant to be “physical repre - sentations of GUI widgets” and a set of application programming interfaces ( APIs ) in various programming languages . The Picoblocks construction kit [ Rusk et al . 2008 ] is similar to the Lego Mindstorms robotics kits , with a focus on encouraging creativity and aesthetics through play . 3 . DESIGN OBJECTIVES If wearable computing holds such promise for education , why has it not achieved the level of popularity of robotics in education ? Even though previous advances have lowered the threshold to wearable computing by lowering the economic and accessibility thresholds , the usability thresholds have stayed at the level of the skilled hobbyist and substantial background knowledge of electronics and programming is still required . For example , it is difﬁcult to imagine average people having enough of this knowledge to be able to create their own intelligent clothing with one of the existing construction kits . For the semiskilled hobbyist or the student in a wearable computing workshop , it is still difﬁcult to create wearable computing fashions with more than a few sensors and actuators . Our goal was to design a modular , user - composable , textile - friendly construction kit for wearable computing and physical computing . We envisioned a construction kit that could be used to demonstrate and teach a wide range of computing concepts to a diverse variety of students , which could be used reliably in the classroom and be able to support both good educational practices and good computing practices . We believed that the most effective approach to addressing the current limitations would be through a construction kit that covers all the aspects of designing and con - structing a wearable or physical computing application from start to ﬁnish . This was inspired by the multitude of robotics kits such as Lego and Vex , which are widely avail - able and easy to use , even by untrained novices or by children . Indeed , we believe that much of the popularity enjoyed by the ﬁeld of robotics in education , toys , and research can be attributed to these robotic kits . An investigation of the various successful robotic kits and a comparison between them and current wearable computing toolkits revealed several major differences . The successful robotic toolkits tend to be comprised of a set of highly durable components that can be reused over and over . They are also extremely easy to use and to learn and , as a result , have found their way into elementary and secondary schools worldwide . Finally , they are priced economically , making it possible for the general public to treat them as toys or gadgets . ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . 7 : 4 G . Ngai et al . In contrast , existing wearable computing toolkits usually require consumable com - ponents that cannot be reused . For example , conductive thread is often used in lieu of wires to create electrical traces on fabric , and this thread is nonreusable . This in - troduces issues related to the cost and the continued availability of these items . In addition , as there are usually no affordances or constraints to guide the user as to cor - rect usage of the modules , it is much easier to make incorrect attachments ; for example , connecting an LED the wrong way around or confusing digital and analog pins . This raises the complexity and unpredictability levels of the task . Finally , most wearable computing kits require a certain aptitude for low - level skills such as sewing or ironing , which again raises the complexity of these toolkits . We argue that these issues are the main reasons why wearable computing has , so far , not been adopted either by the general public as a toy or by the educational com - munity as a learning tool . The i * CATch construction kit was intended to address these limitations by being a wearable computing toolkit suitable for teaching . Our design objectives are based on characteristics and affordances that are typically associated with physical and wearable computing , our investigations into the successful robotics kits , and previous research work in toolkit design and development [ Myers et al . 2000 ] . We outline ﬁve criteria that we felt the i * CATch construction kit would need to meet in order to achieve our objectives . 3 . 1 . Low Floor , High Ceiling , Wide Walls Successful construction kits are often characterized as having a combination of a low ﬂoor , a high ceiling , and wide walls [ Myers et al . 2000 ; Resnick and Silverman 2005 ] . The low ﬂoor criterion dictates the provision of appropriate guidance about proper us - age that will allow even novices to use the construction kit properly . In our particular case , given that our construction kit was intended to support wearable and physi - cal computing , the fulﬁllment of this requirement means that our kit should support novices who do not have prior experience in computing , engineering , or textiles . The high ceiling criterion speciﬁes that the construction kit should not limit users only to simple projects , but instead should allow more advanced users to build increasingly sophisticated applications . Finally , the wide walls criterion ensures that the construc - tion kit does not overly constrain the user in the process of ensuring correct usage , but rather , it should give the user space for personal creativity , thus supporting and encouraging a wide range of different explorations and a diverse variety of designs , at varying levels of complexity . A construction kit fulﬁlling this requirement will necessarily have to support and encourage self - learning and exploration . This should include support for learning styles such as iterative and trial - and - error learning . It should also provide affordances and constraints to give the users adequate conﬁdence that they are using the construction kit in the correct manner . 3 . 2 . Reusable and Self - Contained When investigating successful robotic toolkits , we observed that most of them are com - prised of a set of highly durable and reusable components . This is in contrast with many wearable computing or physical computing toolkits that require consumable compo - nents such as electric wire or conductive thread . These nonreusable components raise the cost of using the toolkit , as well as the inconvenience for the user . To reduce the de - sign complexity and usage uncertainty , the components should not only be reusable , but should also , as far as possible , be self - contained and not require additional components . 3 . 3 . Economically Accessible and Extensible Part of the success of the robotic kits is because they are easily accessible to the research community and the general public . In fact , they appeal to students and the general ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . Designing i * CATch : A Multipurpose , Education - Friendly Construction Kit 7 : 5 public as toys , but teachers see their value at the same time as teaching equipment , masquerading as toys . To control the acquisition cost most effectively , the components of a good construction kit should be easily producible with conventional manufacturing methods . In addition , it should also be fairly easy to extend the construction kit with new modules as needed , which implies a standardized interface , with easily available components and widely accepted protocols . 3 . 4 . Supports Communications and Social Interactions In much the same way that robotics are often linked to intelligent agents that interact with and manipulate the environment—thereby necessitating mechatronic actuators that can grasp , pull , or push—physical computing is linked closely with “smart environ - ments” and ubiquitous computing . Such environments often involve multiple devices communicating and sharing information among themselves . Wearable computing fur - ther involves computers that are intimate with one’s body and that ﬁt naturally into one’s daily life . These situations often involve people using computing devices to inter - act , communicate , and share information through social interaction . We believe , therefore , that a successful physical and wearable computing construc - tion kit should support device - to - device communications , human - to - human commu - nications , and environmental sensing , assisted by the devices . For example , such a construction kit should support proximity detection , which allows devices ( and the people wearing them ) to sense the presence of other devices and wearers . In addition , we proposed that such a construction kit should support social interac - tions . Social computing has become ubiquitous in daily life—much of it conducted via wearable devices [ Burke et al . 2011 ] —and it has a strong personal aspect that res - onates with the intimacy associated with wearable computing . A construction kit that supports and facilitates social interactions between the wearers or users can provide space for creative design and offers potential to introduce computational concepts in a new and exciting way . 3 . 5 . Supports Computing Education Finally , we wanted our construction kit to be able to support a variety of courses for computing at various levels . At the very least , we wanted it to be able to demonstrate academic concepts and encourage students to develop good programming practices . We also wanted it to inspire students to explore and investigate the classroom - taught concepts at higher and deeper levels . 4 . A USER - COMPOSABLE CONSTRUCTION KIT FOR PHYSICAL AND WEARABLE COMPUTING Our vision for i * CATch was a kit that could be used by ordinary users , including novices and beginners , to construct textile - based wearable computing or physical computing systems . These systems consist of electronic components that are embedded into host substructures . These substructures may be garments , soft accessories , or even furni - ture items such as curtains or cushions . Our construction kit , therefore , needed to be compatible with a variety of host substructures , some of which may be very different in form factor or nature from each other . We addressed this challenge by building our construction kit with a modular design that minimizes the coupling between the physical computing layer and the underlying host substructure . Figure 1 illustrates our design . We decoupled the details of the host infrastructure from the functional control , sensing , and actuating layer with a standardized communications and power infrastructure interface . This enabled the two layers to be designed and modiﬁed as independently as possible . It also allowed for ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . 7 : 6 G . Ngai et al . Fig . 1 . Modular design architecture of the i * CATch construction kit . potential future expansion for additional functionality and to different domains and applications . 4 . 1 . An Infrastructure Interface for Communications and Power The power and communications infrastructure provides two functions . First , to support the operation of the functional electronic modules , it must act as a channel for power transmission and signal communications . Second , to support the composability of the construction kit , it needs to serve as an attachment interface between the functional modules and the host substructure , as well as between different host substructure mod - ules . In the following , we will highlight the communications architecture in the context of programming and connection , followed by the adaptation of physical materials to the actual physical interface . 4 . 1 . 1 . LogicalCommunicationsArchitecture . Modules located in the same computing sys - tem usually communicate with each other via two possible models . The ﬁrst is point - to - point , in which the modules are connected directly to each other . The alternative is the broadcast - based model , in which the modules sit on a common communications channel , all messages are received by all devices , and device identiﬁers are embedded into messages to identify the sender and recipient . Point - to - point communications are used by many current state - of - the - art construc - tion kits in wearable computing , physical computing , or robotics . Such architectures are computationally simple after connecting the proper inputs and the proper outputs on the modules and microcontroller . However , they increase the complexity of the con - struction process , as plugging in a component correctly requires prior knowledge about connective inputs and outputs required by the module and identiﬁcation of correspond - ing ports on the microcontroller . This can be intimidating to users without prior experi - ence of electronics or programming . Furthermore , this architecture can also complicate modiﬁcations , as moving a device from one location to another may involve changing the ports to which it is attached , which then necessitates a change in the controlling program as well . This is especially true for wearable computing constructions , in which the wires are usually incorporated into the host substructure for aesthetics and safety reasons , and care must be taken in order to avoid crossing or overlapping wires . We decided to address the aforementioned challenges through a broadcast - based communications architecture , which greatly simpliﬁes the construction process in the construction kits with extensibility , address invariance , scalability , and modularity . Broadcast - based technologies have been used previously , with some success , in wearable computing and physical computing , especially for complex systems that perform monitoring and logging functions , such as PadNet [ Junker et al . 2003 ] and ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . Designing i * CATch : A Multipurpose , Education - Friendly Construction Kit 7 : 7 Weaver [ 2003 ] . However , these fall into the area of high - functionality , specialized applications , not the user - customizable , creativity - oriented applications that we are interested in . The i * CATch construction kit has adopted the interintegrated circuit ( I2C ) bus technology [ Irazabel and Blozis 2003 ] for the broadcast - based communi - cations between the electronic devices . This decision was driven primarily by its widespread use and acceptance in the community , which demonstrates its reliability and extensibility , in contrast to other technologies , such as the one - wire bus technology , which was also considered but not chosen because of the lack of open - source modules . 4 . 1 . 2 . ATextile - CompatibleInfrastructureforPhysicalAttachment , Communications , andPower . One of the biggest challenges encountered when designing i * CATch was the need to accommodate and interface components of different materials . This is especially true when the host substructures are textile - based , such as in wearable computing ( garments and soft accessories ) and textile - based items in physical computing . As far as we know , there is no commonly accepted method to interface electronics to textiles that supports user - level composability . To address this challenge , the approach to the i * CATch construction kit involves mod - ular host substructures that form the infrastructure for communications and power transmission effectively . These host substructures can be combined and joined recur - sively to form bigger structures . They can also support the attachment of functional electronic modules for control , sensing , and actuating . The power and signal transmission infrastructure and attachment interface were realized through the integration of a fabric “cable” with conductive lines that carry the signals and power . “Sockets” built into the communications infrastructure allow a user to “plug in” the electronic components . Given the nature and design objectives of the i * CATch framework , the construc - tion platform , consisting of the host substructure and the communications and power infrastructure ( the fabric cable ) , needed to satisfy the following requirements . —The sockets needed to be able to accommodate repeated attachments and detach - ments of electronic modules , without any deterioration of performance . —The sockets needed to be created from inexpensive , easily obtained parts that work equally well with textiles and electronics and should be consistent with the theme of textiles and wearable computing . —The cable needed to be capable of transmitting the signal over reasonable distances without signiﬁcant deterioration , even when the computing system is under physical stress or deformation , such as when the system is implemented on a garment that is being worn by a user in motion . —The construction interface needed to be understood and learned easily , even by be - ginners and children , and , to the fullest possible extent , to protect novices against their own errors . Since our host substructures are textile - based , the power and communications infras - tructure uses a fabric cable for consistency and compatibility . Previous work [ Buechley and Eisenberg 2009 ] has successfully repurposed strips of conductive fabric as signal and power - carrying lines in place of electrical wires . Our design drew on this experi - ence , and the communications bus was fabricated from conductive fabric . Two lines carry the I2C data communications signals , and the other two lines supply the current . This means that the modules are functional as soon as they are connected to the cable , without any need to carry their own power supply or a separate power source . Figure 2 illustrates the construction of the fabric cable . First , the conductive fabric strips ( lines ) for communications and power in the fabric cable were cut to predeﬁned lengths , including 1 - cm tabs that are extended from the main line at right angles at ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . 7 : 8 G . Ngai et al . ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) Fig . 2 . Making the fabric cable : ( a ) the lines are cut from conductive fabric ; ( b ) insulated with nylon ; ( c ) laid over each other ; ( d ) sewn together to create the ﬁnal cable . the locations in which a socket was desired . Each strip was then adhered to a length of close - weave insulating nylon . The strips were then laid over each other with the data line at the bottom , then the ground line , and then the power , and ﬁnally the clock line on top . This allowed for the necessary separation between the data clock lines to minimize capacitive interference and crosstalk [ Irazabel and Blozis 2003 ] . The edges of the insulating nylon were then sewn together to create a fabric “cable , ” which was stitched to the textile - based components . The “sockets” serve the dual purposes of physically attaching the electronic sens - ing and actuating modules to the host substructure and electronically connecting the sensing and actuating modules to the fabric - based bus , through which the electronics modules can be powered and communicate with each other . The requirements of mul - tiple attach - and - detach cycles rule out the use of pins [ Laerhoven et al . 2002 ] , which can damage the integrity of the fabric communications bus or the host substructure . They also rule out the use of conductive hook - and - loop material [ Nanda et al . 2004 ] . Although it is light and blends in well with the host substructure , it is too susceptible to user error with unsecure or mistaken connections , as the hooks and loops attach too easily to each other . Given all the constraints , our ﬁnal design for the connection “sockets” on the I2C bus made use of 1 - cm - diameter spring - loaded metal snap fasteners . These fasteners are very robust and reusable , as the in - built spring keeps the connection secure over multiple connect / disconnect cycles . They are familiar items to most children , who have no trouble using them . They are also compatible with both fabrics and electronics : On the electronics side , they are conductive and can be soldered securely onto the PCB substrate ; on the fabric side , the buttons can be easily attached to the communications bus and the fabric substrate using a button gun . The four lines in the cable meant that the “sockets” allowing the modules to attach to the cable needed to include four individual “slots” for the “prongs” on the electronic modules to “plug” into . We have designed and manufactured a standardized interface using a snap button for each “slot” to ensure that the layout and conﬁguration of the four snap buttons are identical across the construction kit . To reduce possible errors and misuse , such as plugging in the modules the wrong way , which would damage the electronics , the “slots” for the clock and power lines use female snap buttons , while the other two lines use male snaps , and vice versa for the “prongs” on the electronic modules ( Figure 3 ( d ) ) . The design for the i * CATch construction platform decouples the process of manu - facturing the supporting infrastructure for communications and power transmission from that of manufacturing the host substructure . This has the advantage of mak - ing the process far more repeatable and controllable than if the two processes were interdependent . In addition , the fabric cable itself is a physically separate artifact , ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 .

Creating the fabric - based modules : ( a and b ) the fabric cable is stitched onto the textile base , holes are punched through the substrate and the cable ; ( c ) the snap fasteners are attached ; ( d ) the conﬁguration of a socket ; ( e ) the ﬁnished module . which facilitates the design of host substructure modules of different forms and functions . 4 . 2 . A Modular Design for the Host Substructure The host substructure forms the construction platform for the wearable or physical construction , similar to the role of a breadboard or a printed circuit board ( PCB ) in electronic circuits . As the i * CATch kit was designed to support both physical and wearable computing , the host substructures include both textile - based and electronics - based components . 4 . 2 . 1 . Textile - Based Modules for Wearable Computing . Most previous work on low - entry - threshold wearable computing [ Buechley and Eisenberg 2009 ; Katterfeldt et al . 2009 ] has deployed ready - made garments , such as caps or jackets , as construction platforms . Users sew electronic components directly onto the fabric wearable with conductive thread or attach them with iron - on adhesives . In contrast , the authors have pioneered the development of prefabricated , reusable host substructures for wearable computing . The TeeBoard [ Ngai et al . 2009 ] is a con - struction platform that mimics a fabric - based breadboard , with pre – laid - out strips of conductive fabric , spring - clip - loaded perforations of snap buttons , and jump wires of conductive fabric insulated with ribbons . The TeeBoard eliminates the need for low - level sewing and ironing skills and allows the user to focus more on high - level tasks such as design and programming . It also makes plug - and - play wearable computing pos - sible , and this in turn facilitates explorative learning . The TeeBoard’s plug - and - play paradigm was extended to a more usable and robust form for i * CATch . The host substructure modules consist of ( i ) functional pieces with the fabric bus embedded inside , and sockets on the fabric bus that support the attachment of modules ; ( ii ) connection pieces with plugs ( instead of sockets ) that join together functional pieces and transmit signals and current between them ; and ( iii ) foundational pieces that provide the form factor of the wearable or accessory . These modular pieces are then assembled and the modules are attached to create the ﬁnal wearable construction . Figure 3 shows the process of creating a substructure module . The fabric cable is ﬁrst stitched onto the textile base . A small hole is then punched through the extension tab on the fabric cable through the textile substrate . The post of the base of the snap fastener is pushed through the hole , and the surface of the fastener is attached . This enables the electrical signals and current to be transmitted from the conductive fabric line through the fastener to the functional surface , which attaches to the electronic module . This modular approach allows us to mix and match and reuse the same piece in different contexts . For example , Figure 4 shows a vest constructed from one founda - tional piece , two functional pieces , and one connection piece . One functional piece is then paired with another foundational piece and more functional pieces to construct a satchel . Finally , the same foundational piece with a set of functional pieces is used in ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . 7 : 10 G .

Right : Adapter modules with that accept connections from standard RJ11 sockets . the construction of a decorative quilt . This approach is similar to that used by Nanda et al . [ 2004 ] , with the difference that their modular pieces are more homogeneous and serve the same purpose , while our approach combines heterogeneous modular pieces with different functionality . 4 . 2 . 2 . Electronics - BasedModulesforPhysicalComputingandPrototyping . Compared with the textile - based components , the design of the electronics - based components was straight - forward . Our electronics - based components are built upon printed circuit boards ( PCBs ) , and snap buttons are soldered on to facilitate the attachment of electronic mod - ules . Figure 5 shows the electronics - based modules . As physical computing installations may be very diverse in form , the i * CATch kit includes host substructure modules with standard RJ11 sockets that accept connections via conventional telephone wires .

Finally , to aid in prototyping and testing purposes , the i * CATch kit also includes a testing board module designed to accept multiple functional modules , including the main control module and the power supply . 4 . 2 . 3 . FunctionalElectronicModulesforControl , Sensing , andActuating . The functionality of the wearable computing construction is provided by the i * CATch electronic modules . They include a main control module , which is the “brain” of the entire construction , and peripheral modules that provide input or output for the system . Figure 6 shows some of our modules . Previous work [ Buechley and Eisenberg 2009 ] demonstrated the possibility of man - ufacturing fabric - based circuit boards . However , as these methods are not yet widely available in manufacturing , the i * CATch construction kit uses conventional but small - footprint PCBs that are customized to interface to the textile - based host substructure by soldering on the snap buttons . This allows us to take advantage of the low costs of industrial manufacturing . All of our electronic modules interface electronically with the host substructure mod - ules via the same spring - loaded metal snap fasteners that were repurposed as connec - tors . The snap fasteners are soldered to the PCB in the i * CATch interface conﬁguration . This has created semirigid “plugs” that can be plugged into the “sockets” on the sub - structure modules .

The main control module executes the user program and directs the peripheral modules on input / output . For extensibility and standardization , we ruled out using proprietary hardware or software for the platform ; we designed our main control module on top of the open - source Arduino platform [ 2012 ] , which is widely used in the research and hobbyist communities and which already has a number of modules available for reference . The module , therefore , uses an ATMega 168 or 328 as the microcontroller , with pins 27 and 28 repurposed as the I2C signal lines . To allow for wireless connectivity , the module also includes a serial output interface that can accommodate the attachment of a Bluetooth or a Zigbee module . From experience , we noted that introductory tasks in wearable computing workshops typically revolve around the same sets of sensors and actuators , a small set of which is capable of accommodating a large set of popular designs . For example , many tasks include turning lights on and off , turning a motor on and off , getting a reading from the light sensor , and waiting for a switch to be pressed . To facilitate the use of the i * CATch construction kit for learning , we , therefore , designed the main control module to incorporate a small set of sensors and actuators on - board—two LED lights , a light sensor , and two switches . This integration allows users to write a large number of functional programs without needing to add any peripherals . 4 . 2 . 5 . PeripheralSensorandActuatorModules . If the i * CATch main board is the “brain” of the system , then the peripheral modules serve as the input and output of the wearable computing construction . Examples are input sensors such as light sensors , switches , or movement sensors ( such as tilt sensors or accelerometers ) , as well as output actuators such as lights , speakers or ﬂash memory readers . To facilitate the third - party development of new components or the modiﬁcation of existing components , the peripheral modules were also based on the Arduino open - source platform . Each module , which is identiﬁed with its own unique address , contains an ATMega 168 microcontroller acting as the serial peripheral interface ( SPI ) and connected to one or more sensors and / or actuators . This also allows some preprocessing of received signals to take place on board the peripheral module , thereby alleviating the demand on the microcontroller and the bandwidth of the I2C channel . As the Arduino platform is open - source , other users can modify our modules with their own driver programs , or they can develop their own modules using their own sensors , which is a move toward creating an open standard for the ﬁeld of wearable computing . The only drawbacks are that the ATMega 168 is somewhat overpowered for this task , and the inclusion of the chip on every peripheral module raises the cost of the modules ( by less than US $ 2 per module at the time of writing ) , but we felt that this was a small price to pay for open - source user extensibility and a standardizable interface . 4 . 2 . 6 . PowerSupply . The i * CATch power supply was designed to be interchangeable with the electronic modules and plugs into the same sockets as the electronic mod - ules . The low resistance of the fabric cable ensures that the placement of the power supply does not affect the operation of the electronic modules . This allows the user maximum ﬂexibility in placing the power supply , depending on the usage and design of the construction . 4 . 2 . 7 . Programming Environment . As the i * CATch modules are based on the Arduino platform , the Arduino integrated development environment can be used to program our main board using the programming language Processing , a variant of C . This is the approach taken by many other wearable computing workshops [ Buechley et al . 2008 ; Katterfeldt et al . 2009 ] , and i * CATch programs will also run on the LilyPad and other Arduino - based boards . However , it has been shown [ Resnick and Silverman 2005 ] that ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . Designing i * CATch : A Multipurpose , Education - Friendly Construction Kit 7 : 13 Fig . 7 . The i * CATch development environment . Children can program by dragging icons and linking them together in the top window . The textual program is generated in real time in the bottom window . conventional text - based programming is not the most effective way to teach program - ming to young children . Therefore , we created a hybrid text - graphical programming language that is inspired by Bricklayer [ Cheung et al . 2009 ] and Robolab [ Portsmore 1999 ] , with its own integrated development environment ( IDE ) , which allows program - ming by dragging and dropping graphical blocks representing programming constructs and joining them together to denote program ﬂow . This bears some resemblance to the programming model adopted by the successful instructional programming language Scratch [ Maloney et al . 2004 ] developed by MIT for novice users , albeit with two di - mensions of freedom of expression . Figure 7 shows a screenshot of the programming environment . As the user con - structs his / her program , the actual source code is generated in real time , thus allowing the user to actually see what is being generated and sent to the i * CATch main board and facilitating a later switch to pure text - based programming . Since the text area where the program code resides is editable , at any point , the user may also move from programming in graphical blocks and switches to typing in text programming ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . 7 : 14 G .

We observed some of the best - performing children trying this out , as it made their lives easier , espe - cially when multiple , similar constructs were involved , as they could cut - and - paste the programming code ! A close look at the programs shown in Figures 7 and 8 gives a sense of the complexity allowed by our IDE . In Figure 8 , three programs are shown : The top program is typical of the types of programs written by children at the start of the workshops—a simple sequential program that checks the light sensor and decides whether to turn on the ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 .

The middle program is more complex and is also representative of what we observed children writ - ing after a few sessions : A garment with a light sensor and multiple LEDs detects the ambient light level and controls a vibration sensor accordingly . Figure 7 shows a more complex version of the same program with a timer included for ﬁne - grained control of the garment’s behavior . The bottom screenshot in Figure 8 gives an sense of the high ceiling . The program here is quite complex in logic , incorporating multiple sensors and actuators , and complex effects including light patterns and a tune composed as a sequence of single tones . 4 . 2 . 8 . DesigningforManufacturability . For a construction kit that will be disseminated to the research community as well as the general public , manufacturability on a medium - to - large scale is crucial in order to reduce cost and enhance accessibility . Among other things , it should be manufacturable using common or easily accessible methods and should be easily and reliably repeatable . Finally , there must be a method to assure the quality of the ﬁnished product . By nature , the electronic modules and the programming environment are the easiest parts of the i * CATch construction kit to control for quality and reliability . Conventional software assurance methods can be used to check the correctness of the programming environment , and virtually all of the electronic modules can be assembled by machine , which reduces errors , and tested via conventional methods . The quality and the reliability of the textile - based host substructures , on the other hand , is much more difﬁcult to assure , and this poses a major limitation to our con - struction kit . Our past experience has identiﬁed multiple places where mistakes can be made during the construction process . For example , open circuits can be easily in - troduced into the platform via a snap fastener that is not securely fastened to the conductive fabric , extensions to the fabric cable that are not properly afﬁxed to the main line , or even stitches that place too much stress on the fabric and cause it to fray . Another common problem occurs when the insulating nylon is not secured around the edges of the conductive fabric , thereby creating short circuits when the fabric bus is crumpled and the conductive strips slide around and contact each other . Errors of this sort are not easy to detect—the standard conductivity check by a multimeter fails to detect momentary interruptions in the conductivity . These interruptions disrupt bus signals and cause board resets or program stalls . As there is currently no conventional testing procedure for textile - based conductive strips integrated into garments , we developed the i * CATch test kit ( Figure 9 ) for this purpose . The kit was inspired by the network testers that are used to test the integrity ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . 7 : 16 G . Ngai et al . of Ethernet cables , and its objective is to determine quickly whether the connection between each pair of sockets is functional . Our kit includes two electronic modules , one of which is attached to a battery pack . The modules have LED indicator lights on them , which light up in different patterns corresponding to the connection status between the two modules . These different combi - nations allow us to check if commonly found problems are present in the construction platform , namely loose connections between snap fasteners and fabric cable , short - circuits and / or open circuits , and I2C signal attenuation due to length or resistance of the fabric cable . The i * CATch test kit allows us to control the quality of the i * CATch construction platform reliably as it is manufactured . Furthermore , our kit can also be used by untrained individuals , enhancing the manufacturability of our platform on a larger scale . 4 . 2 . 9 . Highlights . To our knowledge , there has been no similar work done on the design and development of an entire wearable computing construction kit . The LilyPad kit is the most similar in nature , but , as mentioned previously , it is not as self - contained and , as described in previous work [ Ngai et al . 2010 ] , does not support iterative plug - and - play construction to the same extent . 5 . EVALUATION—DEPLOYMENT IN COMPUTING EDUCATION The effectiveness of the i * CATch construction kit was evaluated along with its abil - ity to achieve its design objectives . Since the design objectives are quite diverse , we designed six real - use scenarios that involve multiuser , multiday interactions with the construction kit . Table I summarizes the scenarios , which were chosen to cover a broad range of user types , construction environments , and design requirements . Our ﬁrst two evaluations involved children as users and environments in which the i * CATch toolkit was used as the primary teaching tool in extracurricular summer camps and workshops . The workshops took a constructionist approach [ Harel and Papert 1991 ] and focused on problem solving and learning by incrementally enlarging and building onto fundamental concepts . The instructors were computer science under - graduates , mostly in their ﬁrst year , who were teaching the camps as part of a summer internship program . The instructors were , in turn , supervised by one of the authors . The instructors were directed to help the children work out their designs by acting as a sounding board and a “sanity check , ” but not to help them in the coding or in the construction or assembly of the products . The data were collected through observations , both from the instructors and the au - thors , and the creativity and levels of the ﬁnished projects were demonstrated through presentations by the children as well as code inspection by the instructors and authors . Focus group interviews with the instructors were also used to ascertain the children’s learning experiences and achievement levels . Owing to the children’s maturity , we were not able to conduct focus group interviews with them to collect more in - depth evidence to substantiate our evaluation results . Evaluations were thus more one - sided from the teachers’ point of view , provided by the instructors and authors ; this was the major limitation to these two evaluations . The last four evaluations used the i * CATch toolkit as a supporting and motivating tool in conventional academic courses at the university level or above . A conventional lecture and recitation mode was used , and grades were given based on the correctness and quality of the assignments . The goal here was to illustrate the toolkit’s potential to support academic courses in a manner similar to the way robotics have been deployed as a supporting tool for teaching computing . Regardless of the course nature and the level of the students involved , these courses were all taught by one of the members of ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 .

Ngai et al . the project team and assisted by graduate teaching assistants . As a result , we were able to collect ﬁrst - hand evaluation data , which were collected via observations , assessment of the students’ assignments and projects , and interviews and surveys of the students and the teaching assistants . Although we conducted focus group interviews with the teaching assistants , the major limitation in some of these evaluations was that there were relatively few student focus group interviews . Each of the scenarios was evaluated based on evidence of the respondents’ support of the various design objectives . The low - ﬂoor criterion was determined based on the amount of time that it took the participants to start producing interesting projects . High ceilings , in contrast , were determined by the complexity of the product . Wide walls were determined based on the diversity of the projects that were produced by the participants within the same evaluation scenario , as deﬁned by the way in which users would end up interacting with the product . Since the objective of the i * CATch toolkit is to support computing education , it is also interesting to consider the computational concepts that were evidenced in the participants’ projects . We will describe this aspect for the ﬁrst three scenarios , which involved younger children or participants working at a very introductory level . As they were less biased by prior background knowledge and advanced programming concepts , they provided us with good case studies with which to demonstrate the low - ﬂoor criterion . Their performances also served as a good input for the evaluation of two key pedagogical attributes , namely being able to apply and create . In the following sections , we will discuss the reception of the toolkit by students from different demographic groups . Some of the more notable projects will be described in greater detail . 5 . 1 . Evaluation 1 : Low - Floor Physical Computing Our ﬁrst experiment scenario involved a conventional summer outreach workshop on creative computing . The participants were a group of 11 girls between the ages of 10 and 12 years , recruited through open advertisements . They were familiar with casual usage of computers , but none of them had prior experience with programming , electronics , or textiles . The workshop lasted ﬁve half - days ( ﬁve sessions of 3 hours each ) . The theme of the workshop was “Intelligent Living , ” and the participants worked in ﬁve groups of two to three each . To get the children started , each group was asked to imagine and draw a “device” or a wearable garment related to the theme . The next session introduced them to basic programming principles . The children were then invited to revise their designs and also to start designing the computational logic behind their devices . The ﬁnal two sessions provided the opportunity for the children to put together their devices and to present them in front of the class . On average , each group spent about 7 to 9 hours on the construction and debugging . One group chose to create a wearable computing device ( “an intelligent blindfold for blind - man’s bluff” ) , and the other four groups designed various devices that could be used around the home . One group created a combination entrance doorbell and lighting system ( Figure 10 ) , and another group created a set of curtains that would open automatically in the morning to let in the sunlight . Given the modular design of our construction substrate , the form factors of the projects were very diverse . This experiment demonstrates i * CATch’s achievement of the following design objectives . Low Floor . This experiment clearly required i * CATch to have a low threshold for creating physical computing devices . The children did not have background experi - ence in any of the related topics . Being fairly young , they could not be expected to have the skills and dexterity required to handle more complex tasks such as sewing or soldering . The duration of the workshop was also fairly short , with a signiﬁcant ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . Designing i * CATch : A Multipurpose , Education - Friendly Construction Kit 7 : 19 Fig . 10 . Two girls work on their combination doorbell and lighting system . amount of material to be covered . However , they were still able to design and imple - ment their own projects successfully , due to the low threshold and easy learnability of i * CATch . Wide Walls . This experiment also demonstrated successfully that i * CATch affords wide walls in supporting a variety of designs and devices . Even though the con - structed devices were quite simple , they were nevertheless very different from each other , in form factor , functionality , and logic . The modular design was a contributing factor : By mixing and matching and connecting different pieces together , the children were able to create very diverse devices . This was also facilitated by the broadcast - based architecture , as the program was independent of the location of the electronic module , which encouraged the children to experiment with the appearances of their device . ComputationalConceptsEvidenced . Due to the duration and the nature of the workshop , plus the ages of the children , the computational concepts that were taught and were thus evidenced in the participants’ projects were fairly elementary . Most of the pro - grams involved conditional statements that checked the status of sensors within an inﬁnite loop , linked to sequential statements or simple iterations that controlled the actuators , yet this already covered the three fundamental programming concepts of sequentiality , iterations , and conditionals ! AppealtoNontraditionalStudents . The participants in this scenario were all girls , and the participants invested a lot of effort in the aesthetics of their projects as well as on the minor details of the programs . In describing their projects , they often used the words “pretty” or “beautiful , ” which are not terms commonly associated with robotics or computing ! The children also reported that they enjoyed the workshop , and they especially enjoyed the opportunity to make “useful pretty things” with the toolkit . 5 . 2 . Evaluation 2 : Low - Floor Wearable Computing with Storytelling Our second experimental scenario also involved a summer outreach workshop in en - gineering and technology , but with the theme of creative storytelling and theater ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . 7 : 20 G . Ngai et al . Fig . 11 . Storytelling with wearable computing : A boy pantomimes falling down as the result of an accident ; electronic components on jacket complement story with special effects . art . The participants were 40 junior high school students ( around Grades 7 – 9 , ages 13 – 16 ) , recruited through open advertisements . The objective of the workshop was to use creative art and self - expression to introduce the children to innovative technology and computing . The 5 - day workshop started by introducing the students to computational constructs—such as sequential logic , iterations , and repetition—through a series of simple tasks . For example , they were introduced to sequential logic through program - ming a given pattern of light ﬂashes and speaker effects , and then to iterations by repeating the pattern several times . Conditionals were then introduced through per - forming certain tasks only under certain circumstances , for example , only when the light levels were below a certain threshold . The students’ ﬁnal task for the workshops was to come up with a story that could be expressed with the help of electronic effects on the garments and to act it out before the rest of the class . On average , the students had approximately 6 to 9 hours to work on their ﬁnal stories . Whereas the ﬁrst experiment used i * CATch to construct devices or garments that were in keeping with the theme of intelligent garments or physical computing devices , this experiment extended i * CATch in another direction—to support self - expression and creativity . An observation of the children’s stories and applications of electronic effects showed surprising levels of diversity and creativity . The following gives an example of one of the plays , together with the embedded effects . “A boy goes into the forest [ walking ] and is listening to mp3s [ speaker plays a song ] . He doesn’t notice a tree in front of him and he walks into it [ walks towards a desk in front of him , which is detected by the ultrasonic sensor ] , and he’s badly hurt [ the ultrasonic sensor triggers the turning on of a series of red LEDs ] and falls down [ pantomimes falling down , ( Figure 11 ) ] . An ambulance arrives [ speaker plays a series of notes resembling the siren of an ambulance ] , the boy is sent to hospital [ walks a few steps ] . However , it is too late ; he sees the bright lights of heaven [ all the white LEDs on the jacket turn on ] , and God receives him into heaven [ ﬂings open arms ] . ” Other projects resembled games more than stories . One group devised a garment that incorporated the i * CATch microcontroller , “dressed up” with colored paper and felt scraps to look like a movie director , with two touch sensors “dressed up” to represent gunmen in a Western movie and positioned at the wearer’s hands . A series of blue LEDs was afﬁxed along the tops of the user’s arms . When one touch sensor was pressed , the ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . Designing i * CATch : A Multipurpose , Education - Friendly Construction Kit 7 : 21 blue LEDs were turned on , one after the other , starting from the LED closest to the triggered “gunman , ” and ending at the other “gunman , ” representing the trajectory of a bullet . This experiment demonstrates i * CATch’s support of the following design objectives . Low Floor . The students’ success in creating their stories and garments demon - strates i * CATch’s low threshold and support for learning . While the students in this experiment were not as young as those in the ﬁrst experiment , most of them had no previous background in programming , electronics , or textiles . In terms of using this as a medium for self - expression , this kind of activity was also new to them . Nevertheless , all of the groups were successful at creating projects and presenting their stories in front of the class . Wide Walls . Similarly , the diversity in the students’ projects also demonstrates i * CATch’s wide - wall characteristics and support for creativity and diversity . The projects had a similar form factor ( they were all jackets ) , but there was signiﬁcant variation in the placement and use of the electronic peripheral modules . In addition , the fact that i * CATch was used successfully in this workshop on different stories demonstrates the construction kit’s wide walls and the support for a broad range of potential projects and domains . ComputationalConceptsEvidenced . Compared with the ﬁrst evaluation scenario , the du - ration of the workshop was longer , which allowed the instructors more time to practice computational concepts with the children , who were also older than those in the ﬁrst evaluation . The programs were , as a result , longer and more complex . Compared with the ﬁrst evaluation scenario , the programs also tended to be more linear—this is con - sistent with previous research [ Adams and Webster 2012 ] that showed a tendency for storytelling activities to produce programs that were structured quite differently from games . This perhaps limits the full potential of programming logic , but we noted that complex computational concepts were still evident . Iterations were used mainly for special effects , such as playing a song or ﬂashing of light patterns . Conditionals were also used widely , mainly as triggers to force the program to “wait” for a signal from the user indicating that he / she had reached that point in the story . AppealtoNontraditionalStudents . There were both male and female participants in this workshop , and while we did not notice a difference in the level of engagement , we did notice that the two groups interacted quite differently with the toolkit and the project . In general , the girls’ projects tended to be more story - like and incorporated more characters , while the boys’ stories usually incorporated only one narrator , who also manipulated the controls , or were more game - like ( as in the case of the gunman project ) . The girls also tended to invest more effort into the details , such as meticulously programming their garment to play a song or controlling the LEDs on their garment to ﬂash in a speciﬁed pattern . 5 . 3 . Evaluation 3 : Low - Floor Social and Intelligent Fashions Our third evaluation scenario involved a class of 120 ﬁrst - year , ﬁrst - semester students in an introductory programming course for computer science and information systems majors . Approximately half of the students came from nonscience backgrounds , and about 30 % of them were female . This deviates from the norm in computer science pro - grams in Western countries . The i * CATch construction kit was used in ﬁve assignments involving communications and interaction through the intelligent garment . Some com - munication was between a human being and an inanimate object . For example , one assignment required the users to create synchronized robot – human movements by detecting when a user was walking ( using a tilt sensor attached to the garment ) , and ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . 7 : 22 G . Ngai et al . signaling the robot to move in unison with the human . Other assignments involved communications over social networks . For example , one assignment required students to write a program to check for friends’ status updates on a social network , and then to signal a new status update , and the sentiment behind that update , to the user via lights and sounds on their garment . The students worked in groups of four for the assignments , and they were pro - vided with the following set of components : the main microcontroller with a Bluetooth wireless module , a 4 × 4 LED matrix display , a speaker module , and several sensors , including a tilt sensor and a ﬁve - way joystick . Python was used as the main program - ming language , and the program was executed in “remote control” mode . For the social network assignment , as we did not wish to risk ﬂooding a real social network with run - away requests , we developed our own small network that supported “status updates” and “comments . ” APIs were provided to support communications and control of the i * CATch modules and for data collection from the social network , and to abstract away some of the lower - level details from the students . Out of the 30 groups , only two were not successful at completing all ﬁve assignments . ( The two groups that did not complete the assignments had interpersonal problems that prevented them from working well together ; it was also not helped by the fact that they had members who found computing in general to be too difﬁcult or not particularly interesting and decided to drop out . ) Some of the assignments were also quite creative in their use of sound , light , and color combinations for communications , for example , to indicate different kinds of emotions and to distinguish between an “old” status update and a fresh one . This experiment demonstrates i * CATch’s achievements of the following design objectives . Low Floor . The students in this experiment were all introductory level , and many of them did not possess much background knowledge in science or mathematics . Most of them had never worked with hardware , including robotics , before , either . Nonetheless , as shown in the results of the experiment , most of them did not have any trouble completing their assignments , which is a demonstration of the support of the i * CATch construction kit for novice users . Wide Walls . The students in this experiment were able to create interesting com - munication results via a combination of the device status displayed as well as visu - alization of user emotion . Even though these were in the assignment speciﬁcations , there were also substantial variations in the way in which the students chose to ful - ﬁll the requirements , thus demonstrating the construction kit’s wide - wall support for creativity . Reusability and Reconﬁgurability . This experiment demonstrates the reusability and reconﬁgurability afforded by i * CATch . There were ﬁve assignments over the space of a semester , and there was substantial variation between the requirements of these assignments . We observed that the design of the garments changed quite a bit from assignment to assignment , and interviews with the students indicated that many of the groups chose to start their designs from scratch for each new assignment , taking off all the modules and starting with a “clean” garment . This was clearly possible only because i * CATch supports and encourages plug - and - play and iterative construction , as it would have been quite painful to take out and redo stitches from assignment to assignment ! Communications and Social Interaction . Another illustration of this experiment is the support that i * CATch provides for communications and social interaction . All of the assignments required multipary communications of some sort—either between humans and robots or from humans to humans—and most of the students were able ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . Designing i * CATch : A Multipurpose , Education - Friendly Construction Kit 7 : 23 to fulﬁll the assignment requirements . The students also reported that the commu - nications part , although challenging , was entertaining and made the assignments more interesting . ComputationalConceptsEvidenced . Since this was a formal academic course , as opposed to an extracurricular workshop , it is not surprising that the students took the pro - gramming part a lot more seriously than in the previous two scenarios ! Given that this was an introductory course and a signiﬁcant proportion of our students were from nonscience backgrounds , the programs were not overly complex , although they still dis - played the usual conditional , iterative , and functional constructs . It should be noted , though , that this scenario differed from the two previous ones in the sense that the i * CATch kit and wearable computing was used as an assistive and motivational tool , albeit a heavily used one , rather than as the main focus of the course . AppealtoNontraditionalStudents . Even though this was a university - level course , the class still consisted of a fair number of nonscience and information systems students , who can be described as nontraditional students . We noticed throughout the semester that these students were no less engaged than their peers , and , interestingly , when the projects were presented , quite a number of the groups were represented by their female members , whereas in previous years when robotics were used , it was usually the male members who represented their groups , while the female students looked on . While part of this may be due to the stereotype of fashion and clothes , this is also promising in that it helps to engage a group of students who had previously tended to be more disengaged from the learning process . 5 . 4 . Evaluation 4 : Low - Floor Physical and Embedded Computing The following evaluation scenario involved 150 ﬁrst - year undergraduate students in a compulsory operating systems course , again for computer science and information systems majors . As a course project , they were asked to use the i * CATch construction kit to build an embedded system that was capable of scheduling multiple processes , each of which needed to interact with the environment by changing the color and on / off state of some of the LEDs in the LED matrix . The students worked in groups of four or ﬁve for this project , and each group was issued with a small , ﬁxed set of modules : a microcontroller board , a 4 × 4 LED matrix display , a ﬁve - way joystick , and a buzzer . Driven by the project objective to build an embedded system , an electronics - based module was used as the host substructure . The key task was to simulate the scheduling of multiple processes based on a dynamic pri - ority deﬁned in a pseudorandom manner via a hash function . The dynamic priority was adopted to simulate behavorial changes in the processes . The users simulated the in - sertion of processes into a queue using the joystick , with the available joystick positions corresponding to process numbers , and the order in which the positions were triggered corresponding to the order in which the processes were inserted into the queue . As the processes were “scheduled” to be “executed” ( i . e . , permitted to use the CPU for execution ) , they would change the light - up pattern of the LEDs in the matrix , and the resultant pattern would correspond to the dynamic outcome of the scheduling algo - rithm on the set of processes . Simple pattern management functions , such as browsing , deletion , and automatic generation , were also included in the project requirement . The students programmed the microcontroller directly , using the Processing language to implement the dynamic process priority calculation associated with the selected pattern for all the eight processes . They also programmed the scheduling mechanism for the eight processes based on the dynamic priority , thereby realizing the relevant operating systems concepts . ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . 7 : 24 G . Ngai et al . This experiment has illustrated the i * CATch construction kit’s achievement of the following design objectives . Low Floor . Similar to the previous experiment , the students in this scenario were ﬁrst - year undergraduate students in a second introductory - level course . Many of them were not yet comfortable with additional interface and programming with the computer , let alone with hardware . However , the groups had no real trouble working with the i * CATch construction kit . In fact , they found that the relatively abstract concepts of dynamic priority calculation and process scheduling were a lot more difﬁcult to grasp , beyond the more tangible pattern management functionalities and LED control ! Wide Walls . Even though the design of the assignment did not allow for much cre - ativity on the part of the students , the nature of this experiment was very different from that of the other scenarios , both in the nature of the materials involved and the concepts that it was designed to illustrate , namely , a combination of abstract process control and scheduling concepts with the tangible LED light color change and on / off toggling mechanism . We believe that this is a demonstration of the ﬂexibility , and hence the wide walls , of the i * CATch construction kit in supporting a diversiﬁed educational goal , namely a technical and conceptual one . 5 . 5 . Evaluation 5 : High - Ceiling Wearable Computing with Social Interaction Our next evaluation scenario involved 40 junior - year undergraduate students in an elective computer science course on object - oriented program design . As their course project , the students were asked to design an integrated system involving an intelligent garment and a social network . The requirement was deliberately kept open to allow the students to exercise their creativity ; they were told that they would be graded on the innovativeness of their solutions , as well as the object - oriented designs exercised in their frameworks . The students worked in groups of four or ﬁve on this project . Java was used as the programming language , and a Twitter extension was developed for them to interface the i * CATch construction kit to the social network . The integration of the wearable computer and the social network was implemented using a Bluetooth link to a server program running on a desktop . The students were allowed 4 weeks to ﬁnish their project . Given the design of the assignment , the projects were very diverse . A number of the groups worked on fairly conventional designs , such as using the LEDs to indicate the presence of new messages on the social network . However , there were some creative projects . One group designed a simple “social - exercise machine , ” using an ultrasonic sensor to count push - ups made by the wearer of an intelligent garment , and shared the results with his / her friends on Twitter ( Figure 12 ) . Another group posted the location of the user on Twitter to help this user make arrangements with friends for lunch appointments . By and large , none of the groups had trouble producing satisfactory projects . This experiment demonstrated i * CATch’s achievements of the following design ob - jectives . High Ceiling and Wide Walls . In contrast with the users in the previously described experiments , this experiment involved users who were primarily junior - year com - puter science students . Since this was an elective course , it can also be assumed that students would not register for it unless they had a certain level of conﬁdence and interest in the course matter . In keeping with the requirements and expectations ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . Designing i * CATch : A Multipurpose , Education - Friendly Construction Kit 7 : 25 Fig . 12 . Social exercise machine . The number of push - ups was counted and used for social network updates . of the course , their projects were also fairly sophisticated . This experiment , there - fore , demonstrated the high ceiling of i * CATch in its ability to accommodate more advanced users . At the same time , this experiment also illustrated the wide walls of the i * CATch construction kit . Although the form factor of the students’ projects were all garment related , there was a lot of variation in their functions , and hence the deployed modules . The fact that the different projects could be accommodated shows the ﬂexibility of the i * CATch construction kit . Communications and Social Interaction . Similar to Evaluation 3 ( Section 5 . 3 ) , this project mixed social interaction and communications with wearable computing , us - ing a real social network environment . We observed that this particular requirement posed the biggest challenge to the students , as they were required to think “out of the box , ” but also triggered the most creativity . 5 . 6 . Evaluation 6 : High - Ceiling Physical Computing Our ﬁnal experimental scenario involved a group of 23 computer science graduate stu - dents in a human – computer interaction course . As their course project , the students were asked to design and prototype a physical computing device using i * CATch , with the requirement that it must be able to support “interaction between multiple par - ties . ” Many of the students were technically adept ; a few even had substantial prior experience with electronics . The students worked in groups of four for this project , and they were allowed to use any of the supported programming languages . They were also encouraged to use multiple sensor and actuator modules and to interface the i * CATch construction kit to other third - party platforms . The focus was on creativity and usability of their ﬁnal product . Similar to the previous experiment , the students’ designs were very diverse . One group created a set of “musician chairs” that would detect the positions of their users , which would correspond to changes in the volume or instrument of a piece of music that was being played . Another group created an innovative “pet minder” ( Figure 13 ) , comprised of a garment that would be worn by a pet , an ad - hoc network that would be able to locate the pet through analysis of its links and nodes , and a smartphone app that would post updates about the pet’s status ( location ) onto a social network and also allow the user to check up on the pet via voice control . Yet another group developed ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . 7 : 26 G . Ngai et al . Fig . 13 . A social pet minder . The dog’s movements and eating habits ( and whether he has enough food ) are updated to a social network , which can be queried via a smartphone app . a combination vest / handbag that would sense when the bag was out of range ( and presumably forgotten ) and alert the user if his / her cell phone was ringing inside the bag . This experiment demonstrates i * CATch’s achievements of the following design objectives . High Ceiling and Wide Walls . Unlike all the previous experiments , the users in this experiment were much more advanced , with substantially more background and skills in the relevant areas . They were also afforded adequate time—over the course of a semester—to iterate over and reﬁne their designs . The impact can be seen from their projects , which were much more sophisticated and complex than those from the previous experiments with children or undergraduate students . Their projects were also very diverse in both form factor and functionality . The fact that the students were able to design such complex and diverse projects demonstrated the construction kit’s high ceiling and wide walls . Extensibility . This experiment also demonstrated the extensibility of i * CATch . Three of the six projects expanded the capabilities of the construction kit with additional hardware and / or software . For example , the musician chairs integrated music - mixing software into their project , and the pet minder project involved func - tionalities from social networks ( Twitter ) , voice recognition , and proximity detection . The combination vest / handbag also used proximity detection as well as a cell phone ring detector . Communications and Social Interaction . Similar to the previous two scenarios , this experiment demonstrated i * CATch’s support for communications and social interac - tion . Most of the projects involved multiple microcontrollers ( with attached sensors and actuators ) interacting and thus communicating with each other . At the same time , several projects also integrated social computing interactions ; for example , the pet minder project tweeted the status of the pet onto Twitter , and another project posted Facebook updates about the status of an ofﬁce user , as sensed by the i * CATch components . 5 . 7 . Observations Common to All Experiments In addition to the aforementioned observations , there were others that were common to all experiments and that help to demonstrate i * CATch’s achievements of the different design objectives . ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . Designing i * CATch : A Multipurpose , Education - Friendly Construction Kit 7 : 27 Reusability . To enhance i * CATch’s potential as a construction kit , especially for novices and children , it has to be reusable and durable . During the workshops in the ﬁrst two experiments , we asked the instructors to be especially observant of instability issues with the construction kit modules . Overall , the i * CATch modules were stable and reliable . The semirigid plugs and sockets were durable and stood up to rough handling from the children . This especially applied to Experiments 3 through 6 , in which the students were allowed to take the kits home , which increased the probability of damage to the modules . However , quality control testing after each experiment showed that virtually all of the modules could be reused without repairing . The estimated survival rate per scenario was between 95 % and 98 % . Compared with state of the art , this is an improvement upon the estimated 85 to 90 % survival rate from the LilyPad / TeeBoard workshops [ Ngai et al . 2009 ] . EconomicallyAccessible . As the accessibility of the construction kit depends to a great extent on controlling its cost , the i * CATch construction kit was designed for manufac - turability on a medium - to - large scale . We evaluated the achievement of this objective by manufacturing the necessary electronic modules and construction platforms for our outreach workshops and the introductory programming class . The cost for the basic set ( e . g . , the microcontroller and a small set of sensors and actuators , such as LED lights and light / proximity sensors , plus a small set of construction substrates ) is estimated at under US $ 200 at the time of writing . The manufacturing of the electronic modules was straightforward . The modules had been designed to be manufacturable via conventional automated means , with the exception of the snap button fasteners , which had to be soldered on by hand . However , that was a fairly trivial process and only added a minimal delay ( about 2 - 3 minutes per module ) to our manufacturing process . The manufacturing of the textile construction platform was more complicated , as conventional garment manufacturing processes do not generally involve the integration of conductive components , thus requiring a level of precision and quality control that is not commonly seen in garment manufacturing . We addressed that problem with a design process that is fairly foolproof and easily repeatable , even by untrained individuals , as well as the i * CATch test kit that allows one to assess the quality of the ﬁnished platform easily . In our laboratory , construction platforms are routinely manufactured by ﬁrst creating the communications bus , then afﬁxing it to the textile substrate or an off - the - shelf garment or accessory , and ﬁnally securing the snap fasteners . This process is usually carried out without much difﬁculty by undergraduate students who do not have training in textiles or electronics . Extensibility . The extensibility objective was demonstrated in Experiment 6 . This ob - jective can also be seen through the variety of modules that are currently available for i * CATch . The i * CATch interface is clearly speciﬁed and easily duplicated , and the modules are built upon the Arduino open - source platform , which means that almost any currently existing module can be interfaced easily to work with the i * CATch con - struction kit . Table II shows a list of the modules that are currently available , some of which are adapted from off - the - shelf available modules , and some that were developed by the research team . We envision that more diversiﬁed experiments can be conducted in the future to make full usage of the accessories in i * CATch to further demonstrate its extensibility . Engagement of Nontraditional Students . As mentioned in each evaluation scenario , the domains of wearable and physical computing were well received by the participants . We were especially encouraged by the observations from the third evaluation scenario , in which we noticed that the female students were more participative and engaged than in previous iterations when robotics were used . One notable point , though , is ACM Transactions on Computing Education , Vol . 13 , No . 2 , Article 7 , Publication date : June 2013 . 7 : 28 G . Ngai et al . Table II . Currently Available Functional Modules for the i * CATch Toolkit General Utility Modules Environmental Sensors Actuators • Infrared sensor • Joystick • Communications ( Bluetooth ) • Communications ( Zigbee ) • Proximity detection ( Ultrasonic ) • Proximity detection ( Zigbee ) • Touch • Vibration • Solid state storage • Ultraviolet • Light • Sound • Air quality ( carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide ) • Ambient temperature • LED Matrix • Sound broadcast / recording • LED lights • Frequency modulated buzzer that the older male students were actually somewhat reluctant to participate when wearable computing was involved , that is , they were somewhat reluctant to wear their “product” ! This was not observed , however , when a physical computing product was substituted ( e . g . , in the last three evaluation scenarios ) . We believe that this may indicate a gender preference for robotics / devices over clothing , although this will need to be veriﬁed through further experiments and investigations . 6 . CONCLUSIONS We presented the design of the i * CATch construction kit , a user - composable construc - tion kit for wearable and physical computing that was designed speciﬁcally to support education . i * CATch facilitates plug - and - play , iterative and exploratory construction of wearable computing or physical computing installations by novices and children . It also supports the integration of social computing , which opens up new possibilities for computing education and research . Finally , it was also designed to be easily extensible to a large range of functions and modules . This was achieved through the adoption of a scalable bus - based architecture for the communications network , a standardized interface for the modules and a hybrid text / graphical programming language . To evaluate the achievement of the design objectives and also to assess its efﬁcacy in supporting education , the i * CATch construction kit was deployed in a series of multiday , multiparticipant evaluation scenarios with authentic teaching environments , with the help of more than 380 students . Our evaluation results show that the i * CATch construction kit is successful in facilitating education at a diverse range of academic levels and courses and in satisfying the ﬁve preferable criteria that we identiﬁed .
