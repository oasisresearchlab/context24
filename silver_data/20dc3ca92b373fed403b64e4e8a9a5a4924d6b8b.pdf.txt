A special subset of these arrays comprises membrane - enveloped protrusions of tightly bundled parallel actin filaments , which include filopodia , microvilli , and inner ear stereocilia . These protrusions enhance cells’ abilities to transduce extracellular signals and transport essential metabolites ( Gupton and Gertler , 2007 ; Crawley et al . , 2014 ) . Stereocilia of the inner ear ' s sensory hair cells are par - ticularly exaggerated examples of actin protrusions . Dozens to hundreds of coupled stereocilia make up the hair bundle , the organelle in the inner ear that transduces sound or head move - ments into electrical signals ( Fig . 1 A ) . Each stereocilium is filled with a paracrystalline array of parallel actin filaments ; an interfilament distance of ∼ 10 nm ( Tilney et al . , 1980 ) indicates that cross - linking is performed by tight actin cross - linkers , which include the espin , fascin , and plastin families ( Volkmann et al . , 2001 ; Purdy et al . , 2007 ; Jansen et al . , 2011 ) . Indeed , fas - cin 2 ( FSCN2 ) , plastin 1 ( PLS1 ) , and espin ( ESPN ) have each been reported to be abundant in hair cells ( Tilney et al . , 1989 ; Zheng et al . , 2000 ; Shin et al . , 2010 ; Fig . 1 B ) . Bundled , parallel actin filaments in biological structures are packed either hex - agonally or with liquid order , where the filaments show a high degree of order without being arranged on a regular lattice ( Til - ney et al . , 1980 ) . Stereocilia actin packing is either hexagonal , as seen in chick cochlea and utricle ( Tilney et al . , 1983 ; Shin et al . , 2013 ) , or liquid , as seen in mouse inner hair cells ( IHCs ) and lizard cochlea ( DeRosier et al . , 1980 ; Tilney et al . , 1980 ; Mogensen et al . , 2007 ) . Because they rely on stereocilia for their physiological function , hair cells are ideal for studying structures made of bundled actin filaments . Hair - bundle phenotypes of human , mouse , and zebrafish mutants are often illuminating ; mutations that inactivate hair cell function often do not affect other cell types , either because specialized paralogs are employed by hair cells or because compensation from related molecules can prevent loss of function in other cell types . In many cases , the morphological consequences of mutation of the genes encoding With their essential role in inner ear function , stereocilia of sensory hair cells demonstrate the importance of cellular actin protrusions . Actin packing in stereocilia is mediated by cross - linkers of the plastin , fascin , and espin families . Although mice lacking espin ( ESPN ) have no vestibular or auditory function , we found that mice that either lacked plastin 1 ( PLS1 ) or had nonfunctional fascin 2 ( FSCN2 ) had reduced inner ear function , with double - mutant mice most strongly affected . Targeted mass spectrometry indicated that PLS1 was the most abundant cross - linker in vestibular stereocilia and the second most abundant protein overall ; ESPN only accounted for ∼ 15 % of the total cross - linkers in bundles . Mouse utricle stereocilia lacking PLS1 were shorter and thinner than wild - type stereocilia . Surprisingly , although wild - type stereocilia had random liquid packing of their actin filaments , stereocilia lacking PLS1 had orderly hexagonal packing . Although all three cross - linkers are required for stereocilia structure and function , PLS1 biases actin toward liquid packing , which allows stereocilia to grow to a greater diameter . Plastin 1 widens stereocilia by transforming actin filament packing from hexagonal to liquid Jocelyn F . Krey , 1 , 2 Evan S . Krystofiak , 4 Rachel A .

Here , we examined stereocilia of the mouse vestibular sys - tem , which allowed us to combine phenotypic analysis of mice lacking functional versions of the cross - linkers with thorough protein quantitation and detailed structural analysis . Previous work showed that mutations in Espn , Fscn2 , and Pls1 all cause hearing loss , which manifests at different developmental ages for each mutant mouse ( Zheng et al . , 2000 ; Shin et al . , 2010 ; Sekerková et al . , 2011 ; Perrin et al . , 2013 ; Taylor et al . , 2015 ) . Although deaf jerker mice ( bearing a null mutation in Espn ) lack balance function ( Grüneberg et al . , 1941 ; Jones et al . , 2005 ) , little is known about vestibular activity in mice lacking Pls1 or Fscn2 . We found that thresholds for vestibular evoked potentials , a mea - sure of vestibular sensitivity , were significantly elevated in mice lacking functional PLS1 , FSCN2 , or both . Although PLS1 was the second most abundant protein of utricular bundles ( consid - erably more abundant than FSCN2 and ESPN ) , bundles lacking PLS1 had unaltered levels of other cross - linkers . Utricle ste - reocilia from mice lacking PLS1 were significantly thinner and shorter than those of wild - type mice ; by contrast , stereocilia from mice that express a nonfunctional form of FSCN2 had wild - type dimensions . Double - mutant stereocilia had dimensions that were similar to those mice only lacking PLS1 . The mutants also var - ied markedly in their actin - filament packing . Although wild - type utricle stereocilia had liquid packing of their actin filaments , ste - reocilia formed without PLS1 had actin packed in a hexagonal lattice . Actin packing in utricle stereocilia with mutant FSCN2 was similar to that of wild type , but packing of actin filaments from double mutants was also hexagonal . These results show that PLS1 generates liquid packing of stereocilia actin , even though ESPN favors hexagonal packing . Finally , PLS1 is necessary for formation of stereocilia with larger diameters . Results Functional consequences of the absence of PLS1 or FSCN2 on auditory function To better understand the role of PLS1 and FSCN2 in stereocilia function , we used Pls1 − / − ( Grimm - Günter et al . , 2009 ; Revenu et al . , 2012 ; Taylor et al . , 2015 ) and B6 . D2 - Fscn2 R109H mice ( Perrin et al . , 2013 ) ; the latter line is referred to here as Fscn2 R109H . Pls1 − / − mice were on a C57BL / 6 background ; we confirmed by protein immunoblotting ( Fig . 1 C ) and immunocytochemistry ( Fig . S1 , A – C ) that PLS1 was absent from hair bundles in Pls1 − / − mice and that heterozygotes had intermediate levels of PLS1 protein . Fscn2 R109H is a subcongenic strain containing mostly C57BL / 6 except for the region surrounding the Fscn2 gene , which was derived from the DBA2 / J strain ( Perrin et al . , 2013 ) . Fscn2 is mutated in DBA2 / J , and the R109H - FSCN2 protein produced in this strain can bind to actin filaments but cannot cross - link them ( Perrin et al . , 2013 ) . Mice with this mutation in Fscn2 exhibit progressive hearing loss ( Shin et al . , 2010 ) . We used two strains of control mice , Pls1 + / + and C57BL / 6 . As with Pls1 − / − mice , Pls1 + / + mice were derived from the original Pls1 targeting ex - periments but were maintained as a separate inbred colony . With the exception of modest differences in auditory behavior , results were identical with the two control strains . As previously reported ( Taylor et al . , 2015 ) , Pls1 − / − mice had substantially diminished hearing ; thresholds for auditory brainstem responses ( ABRs ) , which test the activity of the au - ditory system from external ear to brainstem , were significantly elevated in the 8 - to 41 - kHz frequency range when compared either to C57BL / 6 mice or Pls1 + / + littermates ( Fig . 2 A ) . Like - wise , Fscn2 R109H / R109H mice had elevated ABR thresholds at high frequencies , similar to previous studies ( Shin et al . , 2010 ; Perrin et al . , 2013 ) . We also generated mice that both lacked PLS1 and had no functional FSCN2 ( Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H ) ; these double mutant mice had a more severe hearing loss as judged by ABR threshold elevations ( Fig . 2 A ) . Using Kruskal – Wallis nonpara - metric tests followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison tests , we found that Pls1 + / + ABR thresholds were not significantly different from those of C57BL / 6 at all frequencies . In contrast , thresholds for Pls1 − / − and Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H were significantly higher than C57BL / 6 at all frequencies , whereas Fscn2 R109H / R109H was significantly higher than C57BL / 6 at only 32 and 41 . 2 kHz . Thus at 2 mo of age , loss of PLS1 causes hearing loss at all frequencies , whereas loss of FSCN2 only affects hearing at high frequencies . At 8 kHz , where all mutant strains showed some ABR re - sponse , we also found that the positive peak 1 ( p1 ) latencies were prolonged and p1 to negative peak 1 ( n1 ) distance ( p1 - n1 amplitude ) were decreased , with much larger effects for Pls1 − / − and Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H mice ( Fig . S2 , A and C ) . When the responses were normalized for threshold , however , the latency - intensity and amplitude - intensity functions for mu - tant strains converged with those of control mice ( Fig . S2 , B and D ) , suggesting that sensitivity of the cochlea accounted for the differences , not features of the auditory nerve and brainstem . Distortion - product otoacoustic emissions ( DPO AEs ) , which test the activity of outer hair cells ( OHCs ) , were smaller in all mutant strains compared with C57BL / 6 mice , and the dou - ble - mutant mice were more affected than either single mutant alone ( Fig . 2 B ) . Although all mutant strains showed DPO AE amplitudes at or near the noise floor for high frequencies ( > 27 kHz ) , lower frequencies ( < 27 kHz ) showed some strain - specific distinctions . Note that as compared with C57BL / 6 , DPO AE Figure 1 . Actin cross - linkers of mouse vestibular stereocilia . ( A ) Scanning electron micrograph of P30 mouse utricle hair bundles .

ESPN - 1 ( the longest espin splice form ) has nine ankyrin repeats ( ANK ) , two proline - rich domains ( P1 and P2 ) , a masked actin - binding domain ( xAB ) domain , a Wiskott - Aldrich homology 2 ( WH2 ) domain , and an actin - binding module ( ABM ) .

Molecular mass markers ( in kD ) are indicated . Plastin - 1 produces liquid - packed actin filaments • Krey et al . 469 amplitudes were diminished at high frequencies for Pls1 + / + mice . At lower frequencies , DPO AE amplitudes for Pls1 − / − mice were similar to those of C57BL / 6 mice ; however , Fscn2 R109H / R109H ( P = 0 . 021 ) and Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H ( P = 10 − 3 ) mice had significantly reduced amplitudes compared with C57BL / 6 by analysis of variance ( ANO VA ) . At higher frequencies , Pls1 − / − , Fscn2 R109H / R109H , and Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H were not signifi - cantly different from each other . Thus mice lacking FSCN2 had diminished DPO AEs across the frequencies tested , whereas those lacking PLS1 alone were only affected at high frequencies . Functional consequences of the absence of PLS1 or FSCN2 on vestibular function We assessed function of the vestibular system by measur - ing vestibular sensory - evoked potentials ( VsEPs ) , compound action potentials generated by the vestibular portion of the eighth nerve and central relays ( Jones and Jones , 1999 ; Jones et al . , 2005 , 2006 ) that arise in response to a linear jerk stimulus ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . In particular , VsEP thresholds measure the sensitivity of the gravity receptor end organs , the utricle and the saccule . Although VsEPs have previously been used to show the profound functional deficits of mutations of the Espn gene ( Jones et al . , 2005 ) , little is known of the significance of PLS1 and FSCN2 for the vestibular system . Vestibular evoked potential thresholds were modestly elevated ( sensitivity was decreased ) in Fscn2 R109H / R109H mice and more substantially elevated in Pls1 − / − mice ( Fig . 2 D ) . Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H mice were also strongly affected ; they had VsEP thresholds that were only slightly elevated beyond Pls1 − / − alone ( Fig . 2 D ) .

JCB • Volume 215 • NumBer 4 • 2016 470 vealed statistical significance for Fscn2 R109H / R109H mice ( P = 0 . 013 ) , compared with C57BL / 6 , and a much stronger effect for Pls1 − / − and double - mutant mice ( P < 10 − 3 ) . Pls1 + / + VsEPs were not significantly different from those of C57BL / 6 ( P = 0 . 9 ) . Latencies of the p1 and n1 waves were also significantly pro - longed ( P = 0 . 001 ) ; when normalized for threshold , however , the latency - intensity and amplitude - intensity functions essen - tially overlapped across genotypes ( Fig . S3 ) . The VsEP results thus indicate that loss of FSCN2 has a modest effect on vestib - ular function , and that loss of PLS1 more strongly elevates sen - sitivity thresholds . Nevertheless , even losing PLS1 and FSCN2 together has substantially less effect on vestibular function than does the loss of ESPN alone ( Jones et al . , 2005 ) . Accurate quantitation of actin cross - linkers in hair cells An advantage of studying stereocilia cross - linkers in the ves - tibular system is the ability to isolate utricle hair bundles ef - ficiently and quantify their proteins using mass spectrometry ( MS ; Krey et al . , 2015 ) . We previously estimated that the av - erage chick utricle stereocilium has ∼ 400 , 000 actin monomers ( Shin et al . , 2013 ) ; our estimates based on the dimensions of bundles from mouse utricles ( Li et al . , 2008 ; Sekerková et al . , 2011 ) ranged from ∼ 300 , 000 to ∼ 700 , 000 actin molecules per stereocilium , depending on assumptions used . To provide the greatest continuity with previous studies and to permit uni - formity in comparisons of stoichiometry , we assumed that the average wild - type mouse utricle stereocilium also contains 400 , 000 actin monomers . Although the stronger effects on vestibular function of Espn mutations than mutations of Pls1 or Fscn2 suggests that ESPN is the dominant actin cross - linker of stereocilia , a pre - liminary examination of cross - linker concentration in rat utri - cle stereocilia suggested that PLS1 and FSCN2 were present at much higher levels than ESPN ( Shin et al . , 2010 ) . We used the twist - off bundle technique to isolate hair bundles from utri - cles of CD - 1 mice ( Gillespie and Hudspeth , 1991 ; Dumont et al . , 2002 ; Krey et al . , 2015 ) , initially using in - gel digestion to prepare peptides ( Shevchenko et al . , 2006 ) ; we then performed quantitative shotgun MS with an Orbitrap instrument and Max - Quant analysis of the data ( Cox and Mann , 2008 ; Cox et al . , 2011 ) . In experiments performed with bundles from postnatal day 4 ( P4 ) to P6 ( “P5” ) or P21 to P25 ( “P23” ) mice ( Krey et al . , 2015 ) , PLS1 was the second most abundant protein after actin ; there were ∼ 30 , 000 PLS1 molecules per stereocilium ( Fig . 3 A ) . FSCN2 was the second most abundant cross - linker , rising from ∼ 7 , 000 molecules per stereocilium at P5 to ∼ 19 , 000 at P23 ; ESPN was next but was only present at 3 , 500 ( P5 ) and 1600 ( P23 ) molecules per stereocilium . Corroborating the MS results , quantitative protein immunoblotting of cross - linkers in whole utricle extracts suggested that PLS1 was fourfold more abundant than FSCN2 ( Fig . S4 ) . Although label - free quantitation using shotgun pro - teomics on average reports accurate protein concentrations , individual proteins can vary substantially in their signal per peptide . To accurately and precisely measure the abundances of actin , PLS1 , FSCN2 , ESPN ( all isoforms ) , and ESPN - 1 , we used an Orbitrap Tribrid Fusion mass spectrometer to carry out targeted MS / MS . This targeted - proteomics mo - dality is also known as parallel reaction monitoring ( Gallien and Domon , 2015 ) . To improve sensitivity and coverage , we used the enhanced filter - aided sample preparation technique ( eFASP ) to prepare peptides ( Erde et al . , 2014 ) . We used as standards two or three heavy - isotope – labeled peptides for each protein , all of which showed linearity when diluted in utricle extracts over the appropriate concentration ranges ( Fig . 3 , D , G , J , and M ) . The spiked - in heavy - labeled stan - dards comigrated with unlabeled peptides derived from hair bundles ( Fig . 3 , E , F , H , I , K , L , N , and O ) , and all peaks were identified as the correct peptide by searching MS2 spectra against a mouse protein database . Using targeted MS / MS with heavy standards , we esti - mated that PLS1 , FSCN2 , and ESPN were present in hair bun - dles of P23 CD - 1 mice , respectively , at 30 , 500 ± 700 , 16 , 100 ± 600 , and 14 , 800 ± 500 molecules per stereocilium ( Fig . 3 B ) . Between P4 and P23 , the amount of PLS1 and ESPN decreased and that of FSCN2 increased ( Fig . 3 B ) , which was consis - tent with the shotgun proteomics results ( Fig . 3 A ) . C57BL / 6 mice had similar levels of the three cross - linkers , although the ratio of PLS1 to FSCN2 or ESPN was higher in these mice than in CD - 1 mice ( Fig . 3 C ) , a trend that was also seen in shotgun experiments . The amount of ESPN determined by targeted MS / MS analysis was 10 - fold higher than estimates from prior mouse ( Krey et al . , 2015 ) and chick ( Shin et al . , 2010 , 2013 ) hair - bundle experiments . Because we suspected that the in - gel protein digest used in previous experiments led to losses of small molecules like the short ESPN splice forms ( ∼ 30 kD ) , we digested embryonic day 20 chicken bundle proteins with trypsin either in SDS gels or directly in the agarose used to capture bundles . Although the estimated concentrations of most proteins were similar in the two experiments , small proteins ( < 30 kD ) , including ESPN , were substantially under - represented in the in - gel digests ( Fig . S5 ) . We conclude that although PLS1 and FSCN2 account for ∼ 85 % of the actin cross - linkers in stereocilia , ESPN is present at a substantially higher level than previously appreciated . Localization of cross - linkers during development The changes in cross - linker abundance during development were largely corroborated by immunocytochemistry ( Fig . 4 ) , where we used directly labeled primary antibodies to im - prove antibody penetration into the stereocilia actin core ( Per - rin et al . , 2010 ) . PLS1 was readily detected in stereocilia at P1 ( Fig . 4 A ) and increased in intensity over development . FSCN2 levels were modest at P1 but increased at P8 and P21 ( Fig . 4 B ) . Finally , ESPN levels in stereocilia remained high between P1 and P21 ; immunoreactivity was highest in the smallest hair bundles ( Fig . 4 C ) . Interestingly , although each of the cross - linkers appeared uniformly distributed in stereo - cilia , no immunoreactivity was seen for any of them in the taper region at the base of the stereocilia or the rootlets that project into the cell ( Fig . 4 , A – C ) . We also used targeted MS / MS to measure cross - linker abundance during development ( Fig . 4 , D – F ) ; because we measured levels in whole utricle , the final value was the com - bination of the hair - bundle and soma concentrations . In whole utricle , PLS1 was much more abundant than either of the other cross - linkers at P1 ( Fig . 4 , D – F ) . From P1 to P23 , each of the three increased relative to actin ( Fig . 4 , D – F ) . During this time period , the number of hair cells more than doubled ( Fig . 4 , D – F ) . Although the amount of actin in bundles increases over this same time period , Tilney suggested that hair cells build Plastin - 1 produces liquid - packed actin filaments • Krey et al . 471 bundles with a fixed amount of actin ( Tilney and Tilney , 1988 ) . The increases seen in whole utricle over development must therefore reflect increased translation of the cross - linkers in each hair cell , not hair cell production . Interestingly , at 4 mo of age , whole - utricle FSCN2 levels remained high , but PLS1 and ESPN levels declined appreciably . No proteins are up - regulated in hair bundles after loss of PLS1 We used shotgun MS with an ion - trap mass spectrometer to determine whether vestibular hair cells up - regulate or re - distribute actin cross - linkers to compensate for the loss of PLS1 ( Fig . 5 A ) . Except for PLS1 , there were no significant changes in protein abundance in Pls1 − / − hair bundles for any of the ∼ 40 most abundant proteins in hair bundles , including all actin cross - linkers ( Fig . 5 A ) . Moreover , no other protein that might play a cross - linking role ( e . g . , GAP DH ; Waingeh et al . , 2006 ) was present at levels close to that of PLS1 in wild - type or knockout bundles . The lack of up - regulation or redistribution of key stereocilia molecules in Pls1 − / − mice was confirmed by targeted MS / MS ( Fig . 5 B ) and protein immu - noblotting ( Fig . 5 , C and D ) ; note that variability in both as - says could have obscured a small increase in FSCN2 or ESPN . Thus the absence of PLS1 leads to a partial loss of vestibu - lar function without any significant compensatory expression of other cross - linkers . Figure 3 .

JCB • Volume 215 • NumBer 4 • 2016 472 Stereocilia dimensions are altered in mice lacking functional PLS1 There were , however , significant structural consequences of the Pls1 knockout in utricular stereocilia . The tallest stereocilia of Pls1 − / − utricle hair bundles were ∼ 20 % shorter than wild - type stereocilia ( Fig . 6 , A – C ) and stopped lengthening after P7 , unlike wild - type stereocilia ( Fig . 6 B ) . Lengths of P21 Pls1 + / + and C57BL / 6 mice were not significantly different ( P = 0 . 2 ) . The shortest stereocilia of Pls1 − / − bundles were also ∼ 20 % shorter than those of wild type , and the lengths of heterozy - gous stereocilia were intermediate ( Fig . S1 D ) . Other param - eter values describing bundle structure , including bundle array length , bundle slope , and kinocilium length ( Li et al . , 2008 ) , were not significantly different between wild - type and Pls1 − / − mice , except for the ratio between kinocilium and stereocilium length ( Fig . S1 , E – G ) . When examined by confocal microscopy , Pls1 − / − utricular stereocilia appeared to be slightly thinner than those of wild - type utricles ( Fig . 6 A ) . To more accurately determine the di - ameter of wild - type and mutant stereocilia , we isolated them by adsorption to polylysine - coated glass coverslips ( Shepherd et al . , 1990 ) and imaged them using structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ; Gustafsson , 2000 ) . The relatively narrow point - spread function of this microscopy modality permits a more accurate determination of diameter than conventional confocal microscopy ( Gustafsson , 2000 ) . Pls1 − / − stereocilia were indeed thinner ( Fig . 6 , D – F ) ; this observation was cor - roborated by the reduced phalloidin signal ( Fig . 6 D ) , which indicated that mutant stereocilia had less F - actin . As with the lengthening , widening largely ceased in Pls1 − / − stereocilia after P7 ( Fig . 6 E ) . Stereocilia that are 20 % shorter and 20 % thinner should have only half as much actin as wild - type stereocilia ; indeed , protein immunoblotting indicated that Pls1 − / − stereo - cilia had an actin content only ∼ 60 % that of wild - type stereo - cilia ( Fig . 5 , C and D ) . Stereocilia of Fscn2 R109H / R109H utricles were normal both in length and diameter ( Fig . 6 , C and F ) . Moreover , hair bundles of Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H double mutant mice were also relatively normal in appearance ( Fig . 6 A ) , but their stereocilia dimen - sions were identical to those of Pls1 − / − mice ( Fig . 6 , C and F ) . These results show that PLS1 is essential for the lengthening and widening of stereocilia during late postnatal development . PLS1 shifts actin - filament packing from hexagonal to liquid The internal structure of utricle stereocilia changed substan - tially with the loss of Pls1 ; strikingly , the liquid packing seen in wild type was replaced with robust hexagonal packing in Pls1 − / − stereocilia ( Figs . 7 and 8 ) . Packing of actin filaments in stereocilia can be analyzed by optical diffraction ( DeRosier and Moore , 1970 ; DeRosier and Tilney , 1982 ) , where a frequen - cy - domain image resulting from a fast Fourier transformation ( FFT ) displays the geometric characteristics ( like repeat inter - vals ) of the spatial - domain image . Using transmission EM , we examined thin sections of stereocilia processed using freeze substitution . Optical diffraction analysis of transverse sections showed the change in packing clearly ; although the FFT of wild - type stereocilia revealed a circular feature corresponding to liquid packing ( Fig . 7 , A – D ) , the FFT of Pls1 − / − stereocilia actin cores always produced a hexagonal pattern ( Fig . 7 , E – H ) .

The distance from the center to the dense features in the Fourier transform corresponds to the inverse of the actin - fil - ament spacing , which showed that actin filaments were more tightly packed in Pls1 − / − than in wild - type stereocilia ( Fig . 7 K ) .

JCB • Volume 215 • NumBer 4 • 2016 474 In addition , the number of actin filaments in Pls1 − / − stereocilia ( 335 ± 23 , n = 9 ) was significantly reduced relative to the num - ber in wild - type stereocilia ( 403 ± 39 , n = 9 ; P = 10 − 4 ; Fig . 7 L ) . The decreased diameter of the actin core of Pls1 − / − stereocilia thus arises from both fewer actin filaments and tighter packing . Using FFT analysis of small regions or Fourier mask anal - ysis , we saw no evidence for local hexagonal packing within wild - type stereocilia ; packing appeared to be uniformly liq - uid . Likewise , immunogold EM with anti - ESPN antibodies indicated that the distribution of ESPN was not significantly different in cross sections of wild - type and Pls1 − / − ste - reocilia ( Fig . S1 , H – J ) . Images of narrow Pls1 − / − stereocilia , likely taken near the stereocilia base , showed that not only was the packing of the actin filaments hexagonal , but also the actin para - crystal itself could be hexagonal ( Fig . 7 J , arrows ) . In ad - dition , some Pls1 − / − stereocilia had gaps where filaments were missing ( Fig . 7 J , asterisks ) ; gaps were rarely observed in wild - type stereocilia . Tapers , rootlets , and tips of Pls1 − / − stereocilia appeared normal . Actin packing in single and double mutants We also compared all four genotypes using transmission EM with dehydration processing ( Fig . 8 ) . Although mem - branes were more poorly preserved with this method , the liq - uid - to - hexagonal shift in actin - filament packing was also seen when wild - type and Pls1 − / − stereocilia were compared ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) . Analysis of the Fourier features showed that although filaments were spaced 9 . 7 ± 0 . 8 nm ( mean ± SD , n = 96 ) in wild - type stereocilia , they were spaced only 7 . 9 ± 0 . 6 nm ( n = 97 ) in Pls1 − / − stereocilia . The packing arrangement of actin filaments in stereocilia of Fscn2 R109H / R109H utricles was similar to that in wild - type ste - reocilia ; Fourier analysis indicated that the packing was liquid ( Fig . 8 C ) . At 10 . 4 ± 0 . 7 nm ( n = 104 ) , the spacing between actin filaments in Fscn2 R109H / R109H stereocilia was significantly greater than that in wild - type stereocilia . In contrast , packing of filaments in Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H double - mutant mice was hexagonal , with no apparent differences from that of Pls1 − / − stereocilia ( Fig . 8 D ) ; actin - filament spacing in these stereocilia was 8 . 9 ± 0 . 5 nm ( n = 102 ) . We used a multivariate ANO VA analysis to determine the statistical significance of the addition of each cross - linker as compared with the ESPN - only state ( Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H ) . Addition of either PLS1 ( Fscn2 R109H / R109H mice ) or FSCN2 ( Pls1 − / − mice ) significantly changed the actin - filament spacing ( P < 10 − 3 ) , albeit with different polarities . Actin filaments in stereo - cilia with all three cross - linkers ( wild type ) were also spaced more widely apart from those with ESPN alone ( P = 0 . 014 ) , indicating that the effect of PLS1 on spacing outweighed that of FSCN2 . Loss of PLS1 causes changes in actin packing in cochlear stereocilia Given the auditory phenotype seen in Pls1 − / − mice ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) , we examined whether stereocilia structure was affected in outer or IHCs of P23 cochleas ( Fig . 9 , A and B , top row ) . In OHCs , like in utricle hair cells , Pls1 − / − stereocilia actin cores were smaller in diameter when compared with wild type ( 169 ± 22 vs . 186 ± 21 nm ; P = 10 − 11 ) . Moreover , FFT transformation showed that wild - type OHC stereocilia had liquid packing of their actin filaments , whereas Pls1 − / − stereocilia had hexagonal packing ( Fig . 9 , A and B , bottom row ) .

Plastin - 1 produces liquid - packed actin filaments • Krey et al . 475 Stereocilia of Pls1 − / − IHCs have reduced diameters as compared with wild - type stereocilia ( Taylor et al . , 2015 ) . Like in other stereocilia , FFTs indicated a high degree of hex - agonal actin - filament packing in stereocilia of Pls1 − / − IHCs ( Fig . 9 D ) . Surprisingly , many wild - type IHC stereocilia images had a composite liquid - hexagonal structure revealed by FFT ( Fig . 9 C ) . When we used a Fourier mask to reveal the loca - tion of highly hexagonal regions of these wild - type stereocilia , we found that central regions had a higher degree of hexago - nal packing ( Fig . 9 E ) . In Pls1 − / − IHCs , nearly the entire para - crystal was hexagonally packed ( Fig . 9 F ) , as with OHC and vestibular stereocilia . Discussion Hair cells rely on three different cross - linkers to produce the composite properties of the actin paracrystal cores of their ste - reocilia . Despite its comparatively low abundance , ESPN is the most critical cross - linker of stereocilia ; this conclusion is reinforced by the severity of the stereocilia structural pheno - type in deaf jerker mice ( Zheng et al . , 2000 ; Sekerková et al . , 2011 ) and the complete loss of VsEPs in these mice ( Jones et al . , 2005 ) . We found that loss of PLS1 and FSCN2 also affects vestibular function and stereocilia structure , but with notably milder phenotypes . Stereocilia grew to their wild - type length and width only if PLS1 was present , suggesting that the liquid packing of actin filaments mediated by PLS1 may be necessary for stereocilia to grow to their proper dimensions . By contrast , loss of FSCN2 did not impact stereocilia dimensions , consistent with its ability to stabilize the actin core during rapid hair - bun - dle stimulation but allow actin dynamics at longer timescales ( Hwang et al . , 2015 ) . Formation of normal mouse vestibular stereocilia thus requires both ESPN and PLS1 , but long - term stereocilia maintenance ( at least in mouse cochlea ) depends on FSCN2 ( Perrin et al . , 2013 ) . Consistent with those conclusions , FSCN2 expression remained high in the oldest utricles we ex - amined , whereas PLS1 and ESPN levels were reduced . In mouse utricle , there were ∼ 68 , 000 total cross - linkers per 400 , 000 actin monomers , close to the theoretical maximum of ∼ 90 , 000 ( Shin et al . , 2013 ) . PLS1 was the most abundant of the cross - linkers ( ∼ 60 % of the total ) , as well as the second most abundant protein overall ; FSCN2 ( ∼ 25 % ) and ESPN ( ∼ 15 % ) were less abundant . The ESPN concentration we re - port here is considerably higher than that previously estimated using shotgun proteomics with in - gel trypsin digestion ( Shin et al . , 2010 , 2013 ; Krey et al . , 2015 ) , reinforcing the value of the more rigorous targeted MS / MS approach with eFASP peptide preparation . Similar inaccuracies may apply to other proteins quantified with in - gel digestion and shotgun MS , particularly those of low molecular mass . Although not statistically significant , both shotgun pro - teomics ( Fig . 5 A ) and immunoblotting ( Fig . 5 D ) indicated that the ESPN / actin ratio was increased approximately twofold in Pls1 − / − stereocilia as compared with wild - type stereocilia . If the ESPN abundance measured by targeted MS / MS analysis is used , these results suggest that somewhat more ESPN might be present in mutant stereocilia than in those of wild - type animals . There was no evidence for up - regulation of FSCN2 , however . Mice lacking functional PLS1 or FSCN2 have auditory and vestibular dysfunction Pls1 − / − and Fscn2 R109H / R109H mice each display progressive hear - ing loss that correlates with morphological defects in cochlear stereocilia ( Perrin et al . , 2013 ; Taylor et al . , 2015 ) . We con - firmed those observations and showed additionally that Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H mice have an auditory phenotype that is even more severe . Interestingly , Pls1 − / − mice were strongly affected at low frequencies ( < 15 kHz ) in measurements of ABRs , but not of distortion product otoacoustic emissions . By contrast , at low frequencies , ABR thresholds for Fscn2 R109H / R109H mice were normal , but DPO AE amplitudes were reduced . These re - sults suggest that at low frequencies , the Pls1 mutation more strongly affected IHCs , whereas the Fscn2 mutation more strongly affected OHCs . Because we can use proteomics to characterize utricle hair bundles , our focus here is on vestibular hair cells and their function . Thresholds for detecting vestibular - evoked potentials in mice with mutations in Pls1 or Fscn2 were substantially ele - vated , suggesting reduced vestibular function . Double mutants were even more affected . p1 latencies , n1 latencies , and p1 - n1 amplitudes were all affected by the cross - linker mutations . When stimulus values were normalized for threshold , how - ever , the functions overlap ; this result suggests that differences Figure 8 . Packing of actin filaments in single and double mutants .

JCB • Volume 215 • NumBer 4 • 2016 476 seen in latency and amplitude were primarily caused by thresh - old differences in the genotypes . Thus , the loss of vestibular function in mutant animals was primarily caused by reduced end - organ sensitivity rather than changes in neural timing or synchrony ; this conclusion is consistent with PLS1 and FSCN2 expression , which is restricted to hair cells . We also noted that Pls1 − / − , Fscn2 R109H / R109H , and Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H mice did not exhibit overt behavior that correlated with loss of vestibu - lar function ( e . g . , circling ) ; as long as ESPN was present , ste - reocilia formed relatively normally and vestibular function was only partially reduced . These results suggest that formation of functional stereo - cilia actin paracrystals may not require extensive cross - linking , at least in the vestibular system . Although reducing the concen - tration of cross - linkers will decrease the stiffness of an individual stereocilium , this reduction should have almost no effect on overall hair - bundle stiffness ; the taper region and the interstereocilia links dominate bundle compliance ( Hudspeth , 1989 ) and are much more compliant than a paracrystal with hundreds of actin filaments , whether they are heavily cross - linked or not ( Gardel et al . , 2004 ) . Assembly of actin paracrystals by rigid and flexible cross - linkers Actin filaments lack perfect helical symmetry , and opposing subunits on adjacent filaments are not optimally positioned to be bridged by a cross - linker ( DeRosier and Tilney , 1984 ; Claessens et al . , 2008 ) . To form a cross - linked actin paracrys - tal , either filaments must be twisted by rigid cross - linkers or cross - linkers must exhibit enough flexibility to accommodate the mismatches ( Claessens et al . , 2008 ) . Indeed , the actin poly - mer exhibits a significant amount of angular disorder between adjacent subunits ( Egelman et al . , 1982 ; DeRosier and Tilney , 1984 ) , which suggests that filaments have enough intrinsic flex - ibility to twist ; still , the twist must be driven by cross - linkers . Each of the three cross - linker families is thought to bind actin differently and produce different amounts of twist in the actin helical structure ( Claessens et al . , 2008 ) . Espin forms rigid cross - links and induces overtwisting of actin filaments at low stoichiometry ( Purdy et al . , 2007 ; Claes - sens et al . , 2008 ; Shin et al . , 2009 ) , properties that are ideal for controlling the diameter of an actin paracrystal . By contrast , fascins form flexible , rapidly reversible cross - links that can be incorporated during or after actin polymerization ( Vignjevic et al . , 2006 ; Claessens et al . , 2008 ; Shin et al . , 2009 ) ; these prop - erties are ideal for a cross - linker that is used to stabilize a pre - formed actin paracrystal or for a homogeneous actin structure that relies on a single cross - linker . Consistent with this view , Fscn2b of zebrafish stereocilia is highly dynamic ( Hwang et al . , 2015 ) . Finally , plastins are also flexible cross - linkers but must be present during actin - filament polymerization to incorporate into a paracrystal ( Volkmann et al . , 2001 ) . ESPN and PLS1 are expressed early during hair - bundle formation , followed later by FSCN2 . Although the total amount of ESPN in the mouse utricle increases between P5 and P23 , the amount per stereocilium decreases modestly ( Fig . 3 B ) . Im - munocytochemistry indicated that ESPN is at its highest level relative to actin in small bundles ( Fig . 4 C ) , which are presum - ably newly formed . PLS1 also acts early ; although the PLS1 / actin ratio doubled in whole utricle between P1 and P23 , the ratio remained constant in bundles between P5 and P23 , indicat - ing that PLS1 levels at P5 were sufficient to saturate stereocilia binding sites . Finally , FSCN2 expression in the whole utricle increased 10 - fold between P1 and P23 , and the ratio of FSCN2 to actin in stereocilia increased over this period as well ( Fig . 3 ) . The physical properties of fascins coupled with this expression pattern suggest that FSCN2 enters stereocilia late , stabilizing paracrystals already formed by ESPN and PLS1 . These interpretations are supported by results with mu - tant mice . The deaf jerker mouse phenotype , which includes primary effects on stereocilia diameter and secondary effects on length in both auditory and vestibular hair cells , supports an essential role for ESPN ( Zheng et al . , 2000 ; Sekerková et al . , 2011 ) . Reduced length and width of stereocilia lacking PLS1 , corresponding to a ∼ 40 % reduction of filamentous actin ( cor - roborated by the immunoblotting results of Fig . 5 [ C and D ] and the filament numbers of Fig . 7 L ) , suggests that PLS1 drives stereocilia expansion , especially during later stages . In contrast , Fscn2 R109H stereocilia do not show length or diameter defects , consistent with a role for FSCN2 in structural support , but not actin paracrystal dimensions . Stereocilia form their actin cytoskeleton nearly normally with only ESPN as their actin cross - linker . ESPN has several roles in stereocilia , however , as the ESPN - 1 splice form is thought to Figure 9 . Packing of actin filaments in cochlear stereocilia .

Plastin - 1 produces liquid - packed actin filaments • Krey et al . 477 control stereocilia elongation by its local action at stereocilia tips ( Salles et al . , 2009 ; Merritt et al . , 2012 ; Ebrahim et al . , 2016 ) . Espn - 1 knockout mice have mostly normal stereocilia ( Ebrahim et al . , 2016 ) , implying that the shorter ESPN isoforms are crucial for assembling stereocilia . Still , hair bundles initially form with nearly normal morphology in the deaf jerker mouse , which sug - gests that the combination of PLS1 and FSCN2 is sufficient to form a bundle with distinct stereocilia of systematically varying heights . The final form of the bundle thus requires multiple cross - linkers , yet bundles formed with only one or two cross - linkers still function sufficiently well to allow the inner ear to function . Control of actin - paracrystal properties using multiple cross - linkers What features are gained by the use of a composite actin - cross - linker matrix ? Use of more than one cross - linker allows for different packing of actin filaments . Two uniform packing ar - rangements are possible with actin filaments : hexagonal and tetragonal . Both arrangements use the same bonding rules , but successive cross - linkers bind at 60° and 90° intervals , respec - tively ( DeRosier et al . , 1980 ) . Although there is no evidence in vivo for tetragonal packing , many stereocilia , including those from lizard ( Tilney et al . , 1980 ) and mouse ( Mogensen et al . , 2007 ) , show liquid packing , which is intermediate between hex - agonal and tetragonal ( DeRosier et al . , 1980 ; DeRosier and Til - ney , 1984 ) . Our data show that in the absence of PLS1 , mouse stereocilia revert to hexagonal packing of their actin filaments , demonstrating that PLS1 drives liquid packing in stereocilia . Although either ESPN alone or PLS1 alone can produce hex - agonal filament packing , mismatched cross - linker lengths when both cross - linkers are used leads to liquid packing ( Fig . 7 M ) . Other data indicate that PLS1 induces liquid packing in stereo - cilia . Hair bundles of both chicken utricles and chicken cochlea have much more FSCN2 than PLS1 ( Shin et al . , 2013 ; Avenar - ius et al . , 2014 ) , and actin filaments are packed hexagonally in each ( Tilney and DeRosier , 1986 ; Shin et al . , 2013 ) . Liquid packing confers several advantages to wild - type stereocilia . First , the maximal number of cross - linkers required will be reduced by ∼ 20 % ( DeRosier and Tilney , 1984 ) . Second , the entropy of a disordered paracrystal will be favorable , and liquid packing may correspond to a local energy minimum ( DeRosier and Tilney , 1984 ) . Finally , liq - uid packing should allow the diameter of the paracrystal to grow much larger . Actin paracrystals formed with single cross - linkers reach a maximum diameter in vitro of 50 – 200 nm ( Claessens et al . , 2008 ; Jansen et al . , 2011 ) ; the maximum is likely reached when internal strain increases as the actin paracrystal grows larger . The use of more than one cross - linker therefore allows the actin core of a stereocilium to in - crease beyond this limit . Materials and methods Antibodies The mouse monoclonal anti – PLS1 antibody was purchased from Ab - nova ( clone 3G10 , H00005357 - M04 ) , and the rabbit polyclonal anti – ESPN antibody ( against all isoforms ) was generated in the Kachar laboratory ( PB127 ) . For direct immunostaining , each antibody was conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 dye using an Alexa Fluor 488 Antibody Labeling kit according to the kit’s instructions ( Invitrogen ) . Alexa Fluor 568 – conjugated anti – FSCN2 antibody was provided by B . Perrin ( Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis , Indianapolis , IN ; Perrin et al . , 2013 ) . A mouse monoclonal anti – actin antibody ( JLA - 20 ; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) , rabbit polyclonal anti – FSCN2 antibody ( # 37 against peptide CYT LEF KAG KLA FKD ; Shin et al . , 2010 ) , rabbit polyclonal anti – ESPN ( C terminus ) antibody ( pro - vided by S . Heller , Stanford University , Palo Alto , CA ) , and Abnova anti - PLS1 were used for immunoblotting . Mutant mice Production of Pls1 − / − has been described previously ( Grimm - Günter et al . , 2009 ; Revenu et al . , 2012 ; Taylor et al . , 2015 ) ; we maintained them on a C57BL / 6J background by periodic backcrossing to C57BL / 6 . This line was the same as that used for characterization of the auditory system ( Taylor et al . , 2015 ) . We also maintained a colony of Pls1 + / + mice that were derived from the original Pls1 targeting experiments ; these mice have not been backcrossed to C57BL / 6 and have apparently suffered some genetic drift . All results in the vestibular system were the same for C57BL / 6 and Pls1 + / + mice ; the two strains only differed in the auditory system , where at high frequencies , the sensitivity of Pls1 + / + mice was reduced relative to C57BL / 6 . We used separate mutant and wild - type colonies for the proteomics experiments to eliminate the need to discard heterozygous animals , which would be generated by Pls1 + / − incrossing . Because they harbor the R109H mutation of FSCN2 ( Shin et al . , 2010 ) , we used DBA2 / J ( D2 ) mice for early experiments with mutant FSCN2 . Results reported here , however , were all from B6 . D2 - Fscn2 ahl8 / 4Kjn ( Perrin et al . , 2013 ) , a homozygous subcongenic line that we refer to as Fscn2 R109H . These mice , which are available from The Jackson Lab - oratory ( stock 009629 ) , have a mostly C57BL / 6 background except for a small region surrounding the Fscn2 gene , which is derived from the D2 genome ( Perrin et al . , 2013 ) . Results were similar with D2 and Fscn2 R109H mice . The Fscn2 R109H line was maintained by incrossing ( two to five generations for the animals in this study ) . We generated Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H double mutants by standard breeding techniques ; this line was also maintained by incrossing ( two to five generations for the animals in this study ) . If not otherwise noted , wild - type mice were C57BL / 6 . All experiments were performed in accordance with the US Department of Health and Human Services Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals ; animal research was reviewed and approved by institutional animal care and use committees at Oregon Health and Science University and University of Nebraska - Lincoln . Inner ear functional measures Functional studies were completed for the following strains at 2 mo of age : C57BL / 6 , Pls1 + / + wild type , Pls1 + / − heterozygote , Pls1 − / − homo - zygote , Fscn2 R109H , and Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H . Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine ( 18 and 2 mg / ml ; 5 – 7 µl / g body weight ) , followed by maintenance doses of 50 µl every 60 min or as needed to maintain adequate anesthesia . Core body tem - perature was maintained at 37 . 0 ± 0 . 2°C using a homeothermic heating pad ( FHC , Inc . ) . Recording electrodes were placed subcutaneously at the nuchal crest ( noninverting electrode ) , behind the right pinna ( invert - ing electrode ) , and at the hip ( ground electrode ) . Functional measures were completed in the following order : DPO AEs , ABRs , and VsEPs . DPO AEs DPO AE measures were completed for 8 C57BL / 6J , 6 Pls1 + / + , 6 Pls1 + / − , 11 Pls1 − / − , 7 Fscn2 R109H / R109H , and 9 Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H mice . DPO AE stimuli were generated and controlled using TDT System III ( RX6 , PA5 modules ) and SigGen / BioSig software . Pure tone frequencies ( f2 / f1 ratio = 1 . 25 ) , at equal levels ( L1 = L2 = 60 dB sound - pressure level [ SPL ] ) , 150 ms duration , were generated by RX6 multifunction pro - cessor , attenuated through PA5 programmable attenuators and routed JCB • Volume 215 • NumBer 4 • 2016 478 through separate drivers to mix acoustically in the ear canal via the same eartip used for ABR testing . Primary stimulus frequencies were such that the geometric mean ( GM = ( f1 × f2 ) 0 . 5 ) frequencies ranged from 5 . 8 to 47 . 6 kHz . Ear canal SPLs were recorded with a low - noise probe microphone ( ER 10B + ; Etymotic Research Inc . ) . The micro - phone output was amplified 10 times and routed to the RX6 multifunc - tion processor for sampling at 100 kHz and averaging of FFTs of the acoustic signals . The amplitudes of f1 , f2 , and the cubic ( 2f1 - f2 ) distor - tion product were measured from the FFT waveform . The correspond - ing noise floor was determined from the mean sound levels in the fifth and tenth frequency bins above and below the 2f1 - f2 frequency bin . ABRs ABR testing was completed for 8 C57BL / 6 , 6 Pls1 + / + , 6 Pls1 + / − , 11 Pls1 − / − , 7 Fscn2 R109H / R109H , and 10 Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H mice . For ABR testing , pure tone burst stimuli were generated and controlled using National Instruments data acquisition system and custom soft - ware . Tone bursts at 8 , 16 , 32 , and 41 . 2 kHz had 1 . 0 ms rise and fall times with 1 . 0 ms plateau ( 3 ms total duration ) . Stimuli were calibrated using a Bruel and Kjaar 1 / 4 - inch microphone and Nexus amplifier in decibel peak - equivalent SPL ( Burkard , 2006 ) and were presented via high frequency transducers ( SA1 speaker amplifier , MF1 speakers ; Tucker - Davis Technologies ) coupled at the ear via a modified com - mercial eartip ( ER 10D - T03 ; Etymotic Research Inc . ) . Condensation and rarefaction tone bursts were presented at a rate of 17 stimuli per second . ABR intensity series were collected by initiating recordings at the maximum stimulus level and then reducing the stimulus in 5 - dB steps until no response could be detected . Signal averaging was used to resolve ABR responses out of background electroencephalographic activity as described for VsEP recordings . For transient stimuli like those used for ABR , the SPL cannot be accurately measured with a sound level meter . Calibration therefore relied on measuring the deci - bel SPL of a long - duration tone with a peak - to - peak amplitude equiv - alent to the peak - to - peak amplitude of the transient stimulus , giving the peak - equivalent SPL . VsEPs VsEP measures were completed for 15 C57BL / 6 , 8 Pls1 + / + , 9 Pls1 + / − , 14 Pls1 − / − , 15 Fscn2 R109H / R109H , and 16 Pls1 − / − Fscn2 R109H / R109H mice . For VsEP testing , linear acceleration ramps ( producing rectangular jerk pulses ) were generated and controlled using National Instruments data acquisition system and custom software . Mice were placed su - pine on a stationary platform , and the head was secured within a spring clip coupled to a voltage - controlled mechanical shaker ( Model 132 - 2 ; Labworks ) . The head was oriented with nose up , and linear transla - tion stimuli were presented in the naso - occipital axis parallel to the earth - vertical axis . Vestibular stimuli consisted of 2 - ms linear jerk pulses , delivered to the head using two stimulus polarities ( normal , with an initial upward jerk , and inverted , with an initial downward jerk ) at a rate of 17 pulses per second . Stimulus amplitudes ranged from + 6 dB to − 18 dB referenced to 1 . 0 g / ms ( where 1 g = 9 . 8 m / s 2 ) , adjusted in 3 - dB steps . A broadband forward masker ( 50 – 50 , 000 Hz , 94 dB SPL ) was presented during VsEP measurements to confirm the absence of auditory components ( Jones and Jones , 1999 ) . Signal averaging was used to extract the VsEP responses from the background electrophysiological activity . Ongoing electroenceph - alographic activity was amplified ( 200 , 000× ) , filtered ( 300 – 3 , 000 Hz , − 6 dB points ) , and digitized beginning at the onset of each jerk stimu - lus ( 1 , 024 points , 10 µs / point ) to produce one primary response trace . For each stimulus intensity and polarity , 128 primary responses were averaged to produce an averaged response waveform . Four averaged response waveforms were recorded for each stimulus intensity ( two waveforms recorded for normal stimulus polarity and two for inverted polarity ) . Final individual response traces were produced by summing one averaged response to each stimulus polarity and dividing the re - sult by two , thus producing two response traces for each stimulus in - tensity for each animal . Inner ear functional measure data analysis Thresholds for VsEP ( in dB referenced to 1 . 0 g / ms ) and ABR ( in dB peak - equivalent SPL ) were defined as the stimulus level midway be - tween the lowest level producing a discernible response and the maxi - mum level where no response was observed . The first positive ( p1 ) and negative ( n1 ) response peaks of the VsEP and ABR waveforms were scored for latency ( in milliseconds ) and amplitude ( in microvolts ) at all stimulus levels . For DPO AEs , data points at 17 . 6 , 20 , and 21 . 2 kHz were excluded from the dataset , because these frequencies are at or near the ear canal standing wave resonances . For statistical compari - sons , DPO AE absolute amplitudes for the remaining 2f1 - f2 frequencies were averaged for each animal across low ( 6 . 4 – 26 . 2 kHz ) and high ( 27 . 6 – 53 . 2 kHz ) frequency ranges . A multivariate ANO VA analysis was used to compare thresholds , latencies , and amplitudes for differ - ences among the genotypes . In cases where equality of error variance was not met ( using Levine’s test ) , Kruskal – Wallis independent samples nonparametric test was used with Dunn’s pairwise comparisons . Signif - icance level was set at 0 . 05 for all analyses . Hair - bundle isolation Hair bundles were isolated from P21 to P25 mouse utricles using the twist - off method , which is described in detail elsewhere ( Gillespie and Hudspeth , 1991 ; Dumont et al . , 2002 ; Krey et al . , 2015 ) . In brief , utri - cles were adhered to the bottom of a plastic tissue - culture disk , then were immersed in 4 % agarose in Leibovitz - 15 medium at 42°C . The agarose was cooled until firm , and then the utricles were yanked off , leaving the bundles in agarose . Damaged tissue imbedded in agarose was dissected away , and the recovery was estimated by examination using dark - field illumination and a dissecting microscope . Small blocks of agarose ( < 0 . 5 µl ) , each containing the bundles from a single ear , were dissected out and frozen at − 80°C until use . Isolation efficiency was examined using phalloidin staining of isolated bundles in agarose . Hair bundles were fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 4 % formaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in PBS . Agarose blocks were washed with PBS , permeabilized for 10 min in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , and then incubated for 2 h at room tem - perature with Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin ( 1 : 500 ; Invitrogen ) diluted in PBS . Agarose blocks were then rinsed three times for 10 min each , and then a thin disc containing the bundles was shaved from the block using a fine tungsten needle . Agarose sections were mounted on a slide using VEC TAS HIE LD ( Vector Laboratories ) . Images of isolated hair bun - dles were acquired at room temperature on a FluoView FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope ( Olympus ) system and AF10 - ASW 3 . 0 acquisition software , using a 10× 0 . 4 NA U Plan S - Apo objective with 1 . 5× zoom . Images were processed with Fiji ( ImageJ ) software . Bright - ness and contrast were globally adjusted and all z sections were merged into one plane using the Z project tool on Fiji . Shotgun proteomics We quantified stereocilia proteins from wild - type CD1 mice using shot - gun MS with an Orbitrap mass spectrometer . Peptides were identified with Andromeda ( Cox et al . , 2011 ) and then quantified and assem - bled into proteins using MaxQuant ( Cox and Mann , 2008 ) . Technical details for these experiments have been reported previously ( Krey et al . , 2015 ) , and the data are available from ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD002167 . Plastin - 1 produces liquid - packed actin filaments • Krey et al . 479 Comparative proteomics using Pls1 + / + and Pls1 − / − mice were performed using shotgun MS with an LTQ Velos ion - trap mass spec - trometer . Peptides were identified with SEQ UEST ( Eng et al . , 1994 ) and then assembled into proteins using the PAW pipeline ( Wilmarth et al . , 2009 ) . Proteins were quantified using normalized molar intensity ( Krey et al . , 2014 ) . The data are available from ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD004044 . Targeted proteomics For targeted MS / MS quantitation of cross - linkers , we measured ACT , PLS1 , FSCN2 , ESPN , and ESPN - 1 peptides from four preparations of 10 ear equivalents of hair bundles isolated from P21 to P25 C57BL / 6 mice and from four preparations from two different ages of CD - 1 mice ( P4 – P6 and P21 – P23 ) , each of 13 – 14 ear equivalents of hair bundles . In - solution tryptic digests of the samples were prepared using an eFASP method ( Erde et al . , 2014 ) . Proteins were digested in the filter unit in 100 µl digestion buffer with 200 ng sequencing - grade modified trypsin ( Promega ) at 37°C for 12 – 16 h . Three quantified synthetic stable - iso - tope – labeled peptides ( SpikeTides - TQL ) corresponding to each mouse protein sequence ( ACT : EIT ALA PST MK , GYS FTT TAER , AGF AGD DAPR ; PLS1 : IYA LPD DLV EVK PK , MIN LSE PDT IDER , VAF VNW INK ; FSCN2 : FFG GIE DR , FLV LPQ PDGR , YLA PVG PAG TLK ; ESPN : LAP WQR , LAS LPA WR , TLG YDE AK ; and ESPN - 1 : DNS GAT VLH LAAR , YLV EEV ALP AVSR , YLV QEC SAD PHLR ) were ob - tained from JPT Peptide Technologies and used as internal standards ; any cysteine residues were substituted by carbamoylmethylated cys - teines during synthesis . The following amounts of each peptide were added along with the trypsin solution before digestion of each sample : ACT peptides , 500 fmol ; PLS1 peptides , 50 fmol ; FSCN2 peptides , 50 fmol ; ESPN peptides 10 fmol ; and ESPN1 peptides , 1 fmol . Cali - bration curves were run for all peptides by adding four dilutions of each peptide ( centered on the amount spiked into the sample ) to four mouse utricular lysate samples ( 0 . 5 ear equivalents ) prepared in the same way as the bundle samples . Peptides were isolated by centrifugation and were extracted with ethyl acetate to remove remaining deoxycholic acid ( Erde et al . , 2014 ) . Heavy and endogenous forms of each peptide were monitored by targeted MS / MS . Peptide samples were analyzed with an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) coupled to a Thermo / Dionex Ultimate 3000 Rapid Separation UPLC system and EasySpray nanosource . Samples were loaded onto an Acclaim PepMap C18 , 5 - µm particle , 100 - µm × 2 - cm trap using a 5 - µl / min flow rate and then separated on a EasySpray PepMap RSLC , C18 , 2 - µm particle , 75 - µm × 25 - cm column at a 300 - nl / min flow rate . Solvent A was water , and solvent B was acetonitrile ; each contained 0 . 1 % ( vol / vol ) formic acid . After loading at 2 % B for 5 min , peptides were separated using a 55 - min gradient from 7 . 5 – 30 % B , 10 - min gradient from 30 – 90 % B , and 6 - min at 90 % B , followed by a 19 - min reequilibration at 2 % B . Peptides were analyzed using the targeted MS2 mode of the Xcalibur software in which the doubly or triply charged precursor ion corresponding to each peptide was isolated in the quadrupole , fragmented by higher - energy collisional dissociation , and full m / z 350 – 1 , 600 scans of fragment ions at 30 , 000 resolution were collected in the Orbitrap . Targeted MS2 parameters included an isolation width of 2 m / z for each precursor of interest , collision energy of 30 % , AGC target of 5 × 10 4 , maximum ion injection time of 100 ms , spray voltage of 2 , 400 V , and ion transfer temperature of 275°C . No more than 75 precursors were targeted in each run , and no scheduling was used . Three unique peptides for each protein of interest were chosen for isolation based on previous data - dependent discovery data or from online peptide databases ( http : / / www . peptideatlas . org and http : / / www . thegpm . org ) . Precursor isolation lists for all peptides of interest were exported from the software package Skyline ( http : / / proteome . gs . washington . edu / software / skyline / ) and imported into the Orbitrap control software . Skyline was used to analyze targeted MS / MS data . Chromato - graphic and spectral data from the RAW files were loaded into Skyline and analyzed to determine fragment ion peaks corresponding to each peptide . RAW files were also processed using Proteome Discoverer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) software in order to match MS / MS spectra to an Ensembl spectral database using Sequest HT . Fragment ion peaks that coeluted with the fragment ion peaks for the corresponding heavy peptide were chosen for analysis . The type and proportion of daughter ions contributing to the peptide peak were required to match that of the heavy peptide peak . In addition , one or more spectra within the light or heavy peptide peak were matched to the correct peptide sequence within the spectral database . If spectra within a specific sample were not identified , then ( a ) the retention time of the chosen peak must be within 2 min of the retention time of an identified peak for that peptide from another sample , and ( b ) the type of daughter ions contributing to the peak must match the identified peptide peak from another sample . Chromatographic peak areas from all detected fragment ions for the light and heavy version of each peptide were integrated and summed , and then the peak area ratio between the light and heavy peptides was calculated . This ratio was multiplied by the amount of spiked heavy peptide to give the femtomole amount of each light peptide in the sample . The peptide femtomole amounts for each protein of interest were averaged for each sample ( and normalized to the mean amount , in femtomoles , of actin within the same sample ) . The normalized peak areas were then averaged for the four biological replicates of each age and mouse strain to give a mean protein intensity measurement for each protein of interest . For the calibration curve samples , a linear re - gression of the heavy peptide peak area in each of the four calibration samples was performed and tested for linearity around the measure - ment range . Peptides that did not perform linearly ( R 2 > 0 . 98 ) were excluded from analysis . For targeted MS / MS experiments comparing relative protein ex - pression in wild - type versus Pls1 − / − bundles , peptides were measured from three ( C57BL / 6 ) or two ( Pls1 − / − ) preparations of 10 ear - equiva - lents of hair bundles . Peptides were generated using in - gel digestion methods , which have been previously described ( Krey et al . , 2015 ) . Prior to digestion with trypsin , 150 fmol of heavy ACT peptides was added , and light peptide peak areas were measured for all other proteins of interest . Peptide peak areas for each protein were averaged for each sample and normalized to the mean peptide peak area for actin within the same sample . The normalized peak areas were then averaged for the three biological replicates of each genotype to give a mean protein intensity measurement for each protein of interest . All targeted MS / MS data are available at https : / / panoramaweb . org / labkey / crosslinkers . url . Immunoblotting To each sample of mouse utricle hair bundles and whole utricles , NuPAGE 4× LDS sample buffer ( NP0008 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and 10× reducing agent ( NP0009 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) were added to a final 1× concentration . Samples were heated at 65°C for 15 min and then at 95°C for 5 min , and resolved using 4 – 12 % SDS - PAGE gels with MES or MOPS buffer ( NuPAGE gels and buffers ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Proteins were transferred to PVDF ( Immo - bilon - P ; EMD Millipore ) and were visualized with India Ink ( 1 : 5 , 000 ) in PBS / 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 . Membranes were blocked with Prime Block - ing Agent ( RPN418 ; GE Healthcare ) , and probed with specific primary antibodies which were detected with species - specific HRP - coupled secondary antibodies ( AffiniPure 111 - 035 - 144 and 115 - 035 - 003 ; Jack - son ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc . ) and ECL Prime ( RPN2232 ; JCB • Volume 215 • NumBer 4 • 2016 480 GE Healthcare ) . Intensity measurements were made using the Gel Analysis module on Fiji . Immunocytochemistry For direct immunostaining with cross - linker antibodies , dissected utri - cles ( with otoconia removed ) were fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 4 % formaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in PBS . Organs were rinsed in PBS , permeabilized for 10 min in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , and blocked for 1 h in 5 % normal donkey serum in PBS . Utricles were then incubated overnight at 4°C with fluorophore - labeled primary antibodies ( see Antibodies section ; 1 : 250 dilution ) and either CF633 Phalloidin ( 1 : 500 ; Biotium ) or Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Invitrogen ) , diluted in blocking solution . Tissue was then rinsed three times for 10 min each , postfixed in 4 % formaldehyde for 5 – 10 min , and rinsed twice in PBS before mounting . For stereocilia length analysis , ears were removed and holes were created in the bone near the vestibular organs . Ears were then incubated overnight at 4°C in 4 % formaldehyde in PBS . After fixa - tion , the utricles were dissected out in PBS , then incubated in 50 µg / ml protease XXVI ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS for 5 min , and then otolithic membranes were removed with an eyelash . Organs were rinsed in PBS , permeabilized for 10 min in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , and blocked for 1 h in 2 % bovine serum albumin / 5 % normal donkey serum in PBS . Organs were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti - acetylated tubulin ( T6793 clone 6 - 11B - 1 , 1 : 1 , 000 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) diluted in blocking solution , and then rinsed three times for 10 min each . Organs were then incubated for 3 – 4 h in blocking solution with donkey anti – mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 647 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Invitrogen ) secondary antibodies and 0 . 4 U / ml Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin ( Molecular Probes and Invitrogen ) , followed by three 10 - min rinses in PBS . All utricles were mounted on slides in VEC TAS HIE LD using one Secure - Seal spacer ( eight wells , 0 . 12 mm deep ; Invitrogen ) . For the isolated stereocilia samples used for SIM , utricles were dissected and otoconia were removed with an eyelash . Square # 1 . 5 glass coverslips ( Corning ) were washed with water and 70 % ethanol , autoclaved , and then coated with 100 µg / ml poly - l - lysine for 10 – 20 min . Poly - l - lysine was removed and coverslips dried for 30 – 60 min . Dissected utricles were dropped onto the coverslips in dissection media and gently pressed to the coverslip with the epithelium side down . The utricle and dissection solution was then removed and 200 µl of 4 % formaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in PBS was added to each coverslip for 20 min . Coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS and then placed on top of a Petri dish lid inside a humidity chamber . Samples were permeabilized for 15 min in 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % BSA , and 1 % normal donkey serum in PBS and then blocked for 1 h in 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin / 2 % normal donkey serum in PBS . Cover - slips were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution and then rinsed three for 10 min each . Coverslips were then incubated for 3 – 4 h in blocking solution with Alexa Fluor 488 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Invitrogen ) secondary antibodies ( unless primary anti - body was directly labeled ) and CF633 Phalloidin ( 1 : 500 ; Biotium ) fol - lowed by three 10 - min rinses with PBS . Coverslips were rinsed briefly in water , excess water was blotted on a paper towel , and then coverslips were mounted on slides using EverBrite mounting medium ( Biotium ) . Confocal microscopy and image analysis Utricle images were acquired at room temperature on a FluoView FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope system ( Olympus ) and AF10 - ASW 3 . 0 acquisition software , using a 60× 1 . 42 NA Plan - Apo - chromat objective with 4× zoom and 0 . 35 - µm z - steps . All z - stacks were processed using Bitplane Imaris 7 . 3D projections of each z - stack were visualized using the “Surpass” mode and were cropped along the x or y dimension to include one row of hair cells using the “Crop 3D” tool . The cropped 3D projection was then rotated in Surpass mode to visual - ize a y - z or x - z slab of the stack with the hair bundles oriented vertically , and the “Snapshot” tool was using to generate a tiff image of the projec - tion . Stereocilia lengths were measured from the full z - stacks using the “Filaments” tool under manual mode in Bitplane Imaris 7 . The lower and upper end of the longest stereocilium within each bundle was man - ually marked with a point within the 3D projection and then a filament connecting these points was automatically drawn and measured . Isolated stereocilia images were acquired at room temperature using a 100× 1 . 46 NA Plan - Apochromat objective on a Elyra PS . 1 sys - tem ( ZEI SS ) , which reconstructs superresolution images from a series of images acquired under SIM ; the system uses an iXon 897 EMC CD camera ( Andor Technology ) . Images were processed for SIM recon - struction in Zen 2012 ( ZEI SS ) , and selected Z - planes were exported as tiff images in Biplane Imaris 7 . Stereocilia widths ( at their widest dimension ) were manually measured in slice mode in Bitplane Imaris 7 using the measurement tool . Transmission EM : freeze - substitution protocol Freeze substitution and immuno - gold labeling were performed as previ - ously described ( Rzadzinska et al . , 2005 ; Francis et al . , 2015 ) . Utricles and organ of Corti were isolated from the inner ear , quickly transferred to 4 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer at pH 7 . 2 , and allowed to fix for 2 h . The samples were slowly transi - tioned to 30 % glycerol as a cryoprotectant and plunge - frozen in liquid ethane at − 180°C using a Leica Biosystems grid plunger . Afterwards , the samples were freeze - substituted in a Leica Biosystems AFS with 1 . 5 % uranyl acetate in absolute methanol at − 90°C for 2 d and infil - trated with HM20 Lowicryl resin ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) over the course of 2 d at − 45°C . The resin was UV - polymerized for 3 d between − 45°C and 0°C . Ultrathin sections were cut at 70 to 100 nm and collected on hexagonal 300 - mesh Ni grids ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . For immunogold labeling , sections were blocked with nor - mal goat serum , incubated with rabbit anti - espin ( PB127 ) , and labeled with 10 - nm colloidal gold conjugated to goat anti – rabbit secondary antibody . All freeze - substituted samples were imaged using a 200 - kV JEOL 2100 of LaB6 gun type , which was equipped with a Gatan Orius 832 CCD camera . Acquisition software was DigitalMicrograph ( Gatan ) ; processing was done with DigitalMicrograph and Fiji and was limited to cropping and linear adjustments to brightness and contrast . Transmission EM : dehydration protocol Utricles from P21 to P25 mice were dissected in Leibovitz - 15 and then immediately fixed for 0 . 3 – 1 . 5 h in 4 % formaldehyde / 1 % glutaraldehyde ( Ted Pella ) in phosphate buffer at pH 7 . 2 , followed by 40 min on ice in 1 % glutaraldehyde / 1 % OsO 4 ( Ted Pella ) in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7 . 2 . Fixed utricles were then thoroughly rinsed with H 2 O . The tissues were stained en bloc in 0 . 5 % uranyl acetate for 3 h at room temperature and then washed in H 2 O . The utricles were subsequently dehydrated stepwise in acetone ( 50 % , 75 % , 95 % , and 100 % ) at room tempera - ture , using 10 – 15 min for each step . An overnight room - temperature incubation in 1 : 1 acetone / Araldite ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) was performed , followed by embedding in freshly prepared Araldite in embedding molds ( Ted Pella ) . Araldite was polymerized at 65°C for 48 h . Thick and thin sections were cut on an RMC Products MT - 7000 ultramicrotome ; thin sections were collected on 200 - mesh , Rh - flashed copper Maxtaform grids ( Ted Pella ) and stained with Reynold’s lead citrate and uranyl acetate . Sections were imaged on an 80 - kV FEI Tecnai 12 BioTWIN transmission electron microscope with a tungsten filament gun , which was equipped with an AMT Active Vu - M 16 megapixel cam - era ( Advanced Microscopy Techniques ) . Acquisition software was AMT Plastin - 1 produces liquid - packed actin filaments • Krey et al . 481 Image Capture Engine V602 ; processing was done with Fiji and was limited to cropping and linear adjustments to brightness and contrast . Transmission EM : analysis Fiji was used for analysis of transmission EM micrographs . Areas of in - terest in longitudinal or transverse sections of stereocilia were selected , and then the FFT tool was used to carry out a spatial Fourier transform on the selection . To measure cross - linker spacing from FFT transforms of transverse sections , for each stereocilium , three measurements were made from the image center to the spacing feature ( ring or hexagon ) , which were averaged together ; the inverse of this distance equals the cross - linker spacing ( read out directly in Fiji , however ) . Approximately 100 measurements were made for each genotype . Fourier filtering was performed with DigitalMicrograph and Fiji . The area to be filtered was selected and then FFT - transformed . A hex - agonal mask was placed over the predominant reflections in Fourier space using the masking tools built - in DigitalMicrograph , making the mask as tight as possible to reduce background Fourier signal . After ap - plying the mask , an inverse FFT was taken to generate the correspond - ing real - space image ; this image was thresholded in Fiji to remove any background signal and then added back to the original .
