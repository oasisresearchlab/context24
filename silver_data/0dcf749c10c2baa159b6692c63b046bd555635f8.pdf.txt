Harrap See Editorial Commentary , pp XX – XX Abstract —Variants in the gene encoding the (cid:1) - subunit of the epithelial sodium channel ( SCNN1G ) are associated with both Mendelian and quantitative effects on blood pressure . Here , in 4 cohorts of 1611 white European families composed of a total of 8199 individuals , we undertook staged testing of candidate single - nucleotide polymorphisms for SCNN1G ( supplemented with imputation based on data from the 1000 Genomes Project ) followed by a meta - analysis in all of the families of the strongest candidate . We also examined relationships between the genotypes and relevant intermediate renal phenotypes , as well as expression of SCNN1G in human kidneys . We found that an intronic single - nucleotide polymorphism of SCNN1G ( rs13331086 ) was significantly associated with age - , sex - , and body mass index – adjusted blood pressure in each of the 4 populations ( P (cid:1) 0 . 05 ) . In an inverse variance - weighted meta - analysis of this single - nucleotide polymorphism in all 4 of the populations , each additional minor allele copy was associated with a 1 - mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure and 0 . 52 - mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure ( SE (cid:2) 0 . 33 , P (cid:2) 0 . 002 for systolic blood pressure ; SE (cid:2) 0 . 21 , P (cid:2) 0 . 011 for diastolic blood pressure ) . The same allele was also associated with higher 12 - hour overnight urinary potassium excretion ( P (cid:2) 0 . 04 ) , consistent with increased epithelial sodium channel activity . Renal samples from hypertensive subjects showed a nonsignificant ( P (cid:2) 0 . 07 ) 1 . 7 - fold higher expression of SCNN1G compared with normotensive controls . These data provide genetic and phenotypic evidence in support of a role for a common genetic variant of SCNN1G in blood pressure determination .

Mutations in the gene encoding the (cid:1) - subunit of ENaC , SCNN1G , have been iden - tified as causes of Mendelian forms of hypertension and hypotension . A number of independent studies including our own have consistently shown an association between the SCNN1G locus and BP variation in the general population . 1 – 7 More recently , in the Victorian Family Heart Study ( VFHS ) , we used a selective genotyping approach by comparing genotypes in unrelated individuals in the highest and lowest systolic BP ( SBP ) deciles to identify associated single - nucle - otide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in a gene - centered analysis of SCNN1G . 8 This approach identified 6 SNPs with association to BP . In the present study we extend our observations by undertaking much larger and more comprehensive analyses in the VFHS and in 3 other independent populations . Our strategy was to initially test the 6 SCNN1G candidate SNPs in all of the available participants of the VFHS and also in the Utah High Risk Pedigree Study ( UPS ) . 9 From these we selected the 2 most strongly associated SNPs for testing in 2 additional independent family studies , the Silesian Hyperten - sion Study ( SHS ) 10 and the Genetic Regulation of Arterial Pressure of Humans in the Community ( GRAPHIC ) 7 cohorts . We then combined data from all of the family studies in a Received May 19 , 2011 ; first decision June 4 , 2011 ; revision accepted September 14 , 2011 . From the Department of Physiology ( C . J .

Finally , using the human kidney samples from the Silesian Renal Tissue Bank we have investigated the correlation among hypertension , the genotype of SCNN1G , and its renal expression at the transcript level . 11 Methods Study Populations A total of 8199 individuals of white European ancestry from 1611 families recruited into 4 cohorts , the VFHS , 12 the UPS , 9 the SHS , 10 and the GRAPHIC , 7 were included in the association analysis . Details of the recruitment and phenotypic measures for each of the cohorts have been published previously and are summarized in Table S1 ( available in the online Data Supplement at http : / / hyper . aha journals . org ) . In brief , the VFHS and GRAPHIC families were recruited from the general population and the SHS and the UPS were recruited through probands with high cardiovascular risk . BP / hypertension was a primary phenotype of interest in all 4 of the studies . SBPs and diastolic BPs ( DBPs ) were measured using standard sphygmomanometry in the VFHS and SHS and using automated devices in the UPS ( Infrasonde SR - 2 Automatic Blood Pressure Recorder , Sphygmetrics Inc , Woodlands , CA ) and GRAPHIC ( Omron HEM - 705CP digital BP monitor ) cohorts . In all of the cohorts , subjects had 3 BP measurements taken . Representa - tive measures used in this study were those used originally by the specific cohorts : for the SHS this was the average of the 3 measurements , and in the VFHS , UPS , and GRAPHIC this was the average of the last 2 measurements . The UPS cohort is a prospective study with data available at baseline and 25 - year follow - up time points . Only the recent 25 - year follow - up time point was used in the present study . In 648 of the UPS participants , urinary concentrations of sodium , potassium , and aldosterone were obtained from a 12 - hour overnight urine sample at the same 25 - year follow - up time point . Plasma sodium and potas - sium from fasting blood samples were obtained for 1292 of the UPS participants . 13 , 14 The Silesian Renal Tissue Bank is a collection of human kidneys obtained from adult Polish patients ( all of white European ancestry ) with noninvasive renal cancer who underwent elective unilateral nephrectomy . 11 BP measurements were conducted ( in triplicate ) in each subject according to the protocol used in the SHS . 10 Hypertension was defined as SBP and / or DBP (cid:2) 140 / 90 mm Hg on (cid:2) 3 separate occasions and / or treatment with antihypertensive medication . Genotyping and Quality Control Genotyping was first performed in all of the subjects from the VFHS and UPS cohorts on 6 SNPs identified previously in the VFHS based on evidence of suggestive association with SBP ( P (cid:1) 0 . 1 ) in our earlier selective genotyping case - control study ( rs13331086 , rs11074553 , rs4299163 , rs5740 , rs4281710 , and rs4470152 ) . 8 Geno - typing was performed using the LightScanner High Resolution Melting platform ( Idaho Technology ) , which resolves genotype based on melt - ing temperature of the DNA strands . Genotyping of the 2 SNPs with strongest evidence of association with BP in the VFHS and UPS ( rs13331086 and rs11074553 ) was conducted using commercially available TaqMan assays on the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detec - tion System ( Applied Biosystems ) in the SHS . Genotypes of these 2 SNPs in the GRAPHIC Study were retrieved from large - scale genotyp - ing conducted using a 50K Illumina Human CVD BeadChip array . 15 Genotypes for all of the SNPs passed our quality control thresholds ( call rate : (cid:3) 90 % ) and were in Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium ( P (cid:3) 0 . 05 ) . Statistical Analysis Means or proportions for BP and covariates were calculated for each population . Genotypes were tested for Mendelian inconsistencies using family based association test software ( http : / / www . hsph . harvard . edu / (cid:4) fbat / fbat . htm ) . Before statistical analysis , BP values were adjusted for treatment by adding 10 mm Hg to SBP and 5 mm Hg to DBP according to previously described and validated methods . 16 , 17 Initial investigation of association with BP phenotypes was performed in the VFHS population using quantitative trait linkage disequilibrium ( QTLD ) analysis 18 in SOLAR ( Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines ) 19 using a variance compo - nents model specific to the VFHS family structure , including additive genetic , shared environment , and nonshared environmental components of variance ( described in detail in the online Data Supplement ) . To adjust for multiple testing , we used the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Spectral Decomposition method of cor - recting for nonindependence of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) with each other . 20 We did not correct for the number of phenotypes tested because of the strong linear correlation between SBP and DBP ( r (cid:2) 0 . 74 ) . Associations between SCNN1G SNPs and SBP and DBP in the UPS , GRAPHIC , and SHS were examined using generalized esti - mating equation analyses with an exchangeable correlation structure to adjust for intrafamilial correlations and using age , sex , and body mass index as additional covariates . In addition , because of the age structure in the GRAPHIC Study ( paternal generation : 40 – 60 years ; offspring : 18 – 40 years ) , we included age 2 as an additional covariate in the association analysis . In the UPS ( with 3 generations ) we included age . 3 We then combined the inverse variance - weighted averages of (cid:3) - coefficients and SEs from VFHS , UPS , GRAPHIC , and SCS in a fixed - effects meta - analysis . A summary effect size and overall P value were calculated for the combined sample under an additive model of inheritance using METAL software ( http : / / www . sph . umich . edu / csg / abecasis / metal / index . html ) . The between - study heterogene - ity was evaluated using a (cid:4) 2 test . Genotype Imputation Analyses To evaluate whether the association signal could be attributed to other SNPs in the region , we performed imputation of genotypes in the GRAPHIC cohort . A total of 11 SCNN1G SNPs genotyped using the 50K Illumina Human CVD BeadChip array in the GRAPHIC cohort 21 and listed in Table S2 were used for imputation . All of these SNPs were in Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium ( in the parental genera - tion ; P (cid:3) 0 . 05 ) and had very low missingness rate ( (cid:1) 2 % ) . The genotyped SNPs provide (cid:5) 90 % coverage for common SCNN1G SNPs ( minor allele frequency : (cid:3) 5 % ) . We used IMPUTE version 2 22 , 23 ( http : / / mathgen . stats . ox . ac . uk / impute / impute _ v2 . html ) to impute genotypes for SNPs in the chro - mosome 16 interval 23 110 000 to 23 320 000 using reference haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project and HapMap Phase 3 . We then performed generalized estimating equation analysis on the imputed genotypes as described above . Only genotypes with (cid:2) 80 % probability after imputation were used in the analyses . SCNN1G mRNA Expression Analysis In brief , renal tissue was sampled immediately after surgery from the pole of the kidney that was unaffected by cancer and was secured in RNAlater ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) for additional mRNA analysis . Total RNA was extracted from 43 human renal samples ( 24 hypertensive and 19 normotensive ; 25 men and 18 women ) with the use of a commercially available assay ( RNeasy , Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . First - strand cDNA was synthesized with the use of 500 ng of total RNA and random hexamer primers ( High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit , Applied Biosys - tems ) and analyzed by quantitative PCR using Power SYBR Green chemistry and the Eppendorf Realplex system ( Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany ) . Predesigned QuantiTect primers ( Qiagen ) were used ( QT00063217 ) and normalized to expression of the cyclophilin control gene . Each assay was performed in triplicate using 20 - (cid:5) L reaction mixtures containing 10 (cid:5) L of Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( (cid:6) 2 ; Applied Biosystems ) and 200 nmol / L of forward and reverse primers . Amplification was performed according to the following conditions , 1 cycle at 95°C for 10 minutes , 50 cycles at 95°C for 15 seconds , and 60°C for 1 minute . Melting curve analyses were performed to check PCR product specificity .

The fold difference in SCNN1G expression between hypertensive and normotensive subjects was calculated according to the following formula : fold difference (cid:2) 2 (cid:7) difference between dCt of hypertensive and normotensive samples . 24 Genotyping of rs13331086 was completed in the Silesian Renal Tissue Bank using TaqMan assays on the ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system ( Applied Biosystems ) . Because of low minor allele frequency , individuals with a minor homozygous genotype were grouped with heterozygous genotype subjects in the data analysis . A 2 - tailed t test was used to compare differences in renal expression of SCNN1G between both groups . Additional information on materials and methods is provided in the online Data Supplement ( please see http : / / hyper . ahajournals . org ) . Results Association Analyses SCNN1G and BP in the VFHS Of the 2959 participants in the VFHS cohort , DNA was available for 2876 individuals , and this was included in the present study . Six SNPs were genotyped in this cohort , rs13331086 , rs11074553 , rs4299163 , rs5740 , rs4281710 , and rs4470152 . After adjustment for treatment effect and demographic variables in QTLD analysis , we identified an association between SBP and 1 SCNN1G SNP ( rs13331086 ; QTLD P (cid:2) 0 . 014 ; Table 1 ) . This result passed the significance threshold of P (cid:1) 0 . 017 as determined by the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Spectral Decomposition method to account for multiple testing . Our estimations showed that each addi - tional minor allele was associated with a 0 . 81 - mm Hg ( SE : (cid:8) 0 . 46 mm Hg ) increase in SBP ( Table 1 ) . The direction of the allele effect on DBP was consistent with SBP , but the association was not significant ( P (cid:2) 0 . 58 ; Table 1 ) . SNP rs11074553 showed borderline association with SBP ( P (cid:2) 0 . 08 ) . No other SNPs displayed any evidence of associ - ation with these phenotypes ( all other P values (cid:3) 0 . 1 ) . Utah Pedigree Study Evidence of association in the UPS cohort was detected between the SCNN1G SNP rs13331086 and DBP , each additional copy of the minor allele was associated with a 1 - mm Hg ( (cid:8) 0 . 48 mm Hg ; P (cid:2) 0 . 04 ) increase in DBP ( Table S3 ) . The association between SBP and rs13331086 was not observed in this population ( P (cid:2) 0 . 49 ) . Other SNPs were not associated with BP ( all other P values (cid:3) 0 . 1 ) . GRAPHIC Study There was a borderline association between rs13331086 and SBP ( (cid:3) (cid:2) 1 . 15 ; SE (cid:2) 0 . 6 ; P (cid:2) 0 . 06 ) in the GRAPHIC Study . No association was observed with rs11074553 ( all P values (cid:3) 0 . 1 , see Table S4 ) . Silesian Hypertension Study In the SHS cohort , there was association between rs13331086 and both SBP ( (cid:3) (cid:2) 4 . 25 ; SE (cid:2) 1 . 74 ; P (cid:2) 0 . 02 ) and DBP ( (cid:3) (cid:2) 2 . 05 ; SE (cid:2) 1 ; P (cid:2) 0 . 04 ) . No association was observed with rs11074553 ( P (cid:3) 0 . 1 , see Table S5 ) . Meta - Analysis In the combined inverse variance effects meta - analysis of the data from the 6753 informative subjects from the VFHS , UPS , SHS , and GRAPHIC cohorts , each copy of the minor allele of rs13331086 was associated with 1 . 01 - mm Hg higher SBP ( P (cid:2) 0 . 002 ) and 0 . 52 - mm Hg higher DBP ( P (cid:2) 0 . 01 ) after adjustment for age , sex , and body mass index ( Table 2 ) . There was no evidence of heterogeneity in effect sizes across the 4 populations included in the meta - analysis ( P (cid:2) 0 . 19 ) . Imputation Analyses A total of 43 SCNN1G SNPs were included in the analysis of clinic SBP and DBP after all of the postimputation quality filters in the GRAPHIC Study . Generalized estimating equation - based analysis was adjusted for treatment effect , as well as age , age 2 , sex , and body mass index , as per the original analyses . None of the imputed SCNN1G SNPs showed association with clinic BP at the nominal level of statistical significance ; however , the magnitude of association with SBP for a total of 26 imputed SNPs ( linked to rs13331086 , LD r 2 (cid:3) 0 . 9 ; Table S6 ) was similar to that with rs13331086 .

No significant evidence of asso - ciation was detected between rs13331086 and 12 - hour uri - nary excretion of sodium ( P (cid:2) 0 . 24 ) or aldosterone ( P (cid:2) 0 . 24 ) . No association was observed with the urinary sodium / potas - sium ratio ( P (cid:2) 0 . 99 ) or with plasma sodium or potassium levels ( P (cid:2) 0 . 30 and 0 . 57 , respectively ) . SCNN1G and Hypertension : Renal Expression Analysis Our preliminary analyses of SCNN1G expression in renal tissue revealed that , compared with normotensive individuals , hyper - tensive patients had a 1 . 7 - fold higher expression of SCNN1G in kidneys ( dCt for normotensives (cid:2) 2 . 5 (cid:8) 0 . 33 versus 1 . 7 (cid:8) 0 . 22 for hypertensives ; P (cid:2) 0 . 07 ) . The genotype distribution of rs13331086 in these individuals was in HWE ( P (cid:2) 0 . 41 ) , and we observed that there was no difference in renal expression of SCNN1G between contrasting genotypes of rs13331086 ( P (cid:2) 0 . 36 ; minor allele carriers n (cid:2) 20 , dCt (cid:2) 1 . 87 (cid:8) 0 . 17 ; major allele homozygotes n (cid:2) 23 , dCt (cid:2) 2 . 22 (cid:8) 0 . 21 ) . Discussion In these independent family based analyses of the association of BP with genetic variation in SCNN1G , our attention was focused on the SNP rs13331086 , which we had detected as the most significant variant in our previous study . 8 In the present study we undertook family based association analyses in the entire VFHS cohort and obtained corroborative evi - dence for association between rs13331086 and SBP . Meta - analysis in the 4 populations indicated that the minor allele of this SNP ( G ) was associated with a 1 . 01 - mm Hg increase in SBP and 0 . 52 - mm Hg increase in DBP . In an individual homozygous for the minor allele of the SNP , this equates to a BP on average 2 / 1 mm Hg higher than those homozygous for the common allele . Although modest in clinical terms , the magnitude of association between BP and rs13331086 corre - sponds well with expected effect of a single SNP on this complex , polygenic trait . Similar estimates were documented in a recently published genome - wide association study for BP . 25 The SNP rs13331086 is located in an intronic region of SCNN1G that is not evolutionarily conserved and has no obvious functional annotation ; however , according to the University of California , Santa Cruz Genome Browser data - base ( http : / / genome . ucsc . edu / ) , the SNP rs13331086 lies within a human expressed sequence tag , and it , therefore , has a potential role as a regulator of SCNN1G expression . It is possible that a functional variant in strong LD with rs13331086 could be a driver for the observed association . Indeed , 26 SCNN1G SNPs are in strong LD with rs13331086 ( Figure ) . Of these , (cid:2) 3 may affect mRNA structure / protein function when introduced into in silico analyses . The SNP rs5723 is a synonymous coding variant , and SNP rs5727 is located in the 3 (cid:9) untranslated region and is predicted in silico by the SNP Function Annotation Portal ( http : / / brainarray . mbni . med . umich . edu / Brainarray / default . asp ) to be a potential microRNA binding site for hsa - miR - 29a and hsa - miR - 29c , whereas SNP rs13306653 is predicted to be in a functional region of the gene ( splice site ) . Similar to rs13331086 , these 3 potentially functional SNPs showed borderline association with clinic SBP in the imputation analysis . This predominantly genetic analysis was not designed to investigate potential phenotypic correlates in any detailed fashion . The availability of data from the UPS cohort regard - ing relevant urinary and plasma measures related to the renal function of the ENaC offered an opportunity for preliminary analysis . We found that the G allele of rs13331086 , which is associated with higher BP , was also associated with increased urinary potassium excretion measured over a 12 - hour over - night period . One could postulate increased expression of ENaC in the distal nephron of the kidney that would favor increased sodium reabsorption , which , as a result of subse - quent electrochemical gradients , would favor the excretion of potassium via the renal outer medullary potassium channel . 26 We did not observe any significant association of the SNP with either urinary Na or the Na / K ratio . A previous study examining hypertensive patients compared with normoten - sive controls found that variants in the (cid:3) - and (cid:1) - subunit ENaC genes were associated with the urinary potassium / plasma renin ratio , although they did not detect association with either variable alone . 27 They suggested that , even with - out strong effects on the phenotypes , the variants could act as subtle genes conferring predisposition to sodium retention and hypertension acting continuously over a lifetime . In addition , a recently published study has shown that SCNN1G variants are associated with the BP response to dietary sodium intake , indicating that SCNN1G may be involved in short - term response to sodium . 28 Accordingly , the expression study of human renal tissue indicates a trend toward increased expression of SCNN1G mRNA in hypertensive patients compared with controls . Although not significant and although it may not be directly linked to the SNP rs13331086 , the fact that this trend emerges from the diverse sources of confounding variables that might obscure potentially subtle expression changes in the kidney indicates a potentially important lead that requires more detailed studies . It is clear that an increase in ENaC expres - sion is associated with the development of hypertension , whereas the inverse is related to decreased BP , as is evident in the phenotypes of Liddle syndrome and pseudohypoaldo - steronism type I , respectively . 29 Moreover , decreased ENaC expression / activity has been shown to prevent the develop - ment of hypertension in a mouse model of activation of the thiazide - sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter . 30 To our knowledge , this is the first study to compare the expression of ENaC between hypertensive and normotensive kidneys in humans . It would be fair to acknowledge that , although traditionally considered as a renal determinant of BP , the ENaC is also expressed in other tissues . For example , ENaC has been located on smooth muscle cells in arteries where it appears to 4 Hypertension December 2011 by gu e s t on A p r il 20 , 2017 h tt p : / / hyp e r . a h a j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m serve as an initiator of pressure - dependent myogenic re - sponses in juxtamedullary afferent arterioles . 31 Other vascular autoregulatory roles of this channel have been attributed to endothelial mechanisms that mediate the arterial flow - dependent vasodilatation . Evidence exists that ENaC medi - ates sodium entry into endothelial cells , thereby altering their deformability and sensitivity to shear stress that results in the release of NO and , consequently , vasodilatation . 32 These channels are also known to exist in central nervous regions involved in BP homeostasis and have been identified as important mediators of aldosterone production in the adrenal cortex . 33 , 34 Perspectives Identifying the genes responsible for population variation in BP is a complex challenge . Although the large genome - wide association studies have been successful in identifying novel genes for multiple complex disorders , in the field of hyper - tension they have had limited success . Using a candidate gene approach with a strong physiological justification , we have identified a common genetic variant in the SCNN1G gene associated with increased SBP and DBP in a meta - analysis of (cid:3) 6000 individuals . In addition , our preliminary experiments indicate increased SCNN1G mRNA expression in hyperten - sive patients and hint at increased ENaC activity in subjects carrying the minor allele . This common variant with rela - tively small phenotypic effects on a population - wide basis adds to the role for SCNN1G in BP , better known for the well - characterized rare SCNN1G mutations associated with hypertensive Mendelian diseases . It is clear that a thorough investigation of the physiological actions associated with the rs13331086 SNP and those in strong LD should be a focus for further research .

Where individuals j and k are not twins , γ jk was estimated and assumed to be no greater than one . Correlation between spouses was treated differently . No attempt was made to separate this into genetic and environmental components , and γ sp represents the combined correlation 1 . Environmental correlations for both MZ and DZ twin pairs were set equal to 1 , in order to satisfy the assumptions of the classic twin model and to ensure identifiability . SOLAR uses matrix notation which requires the use of Δ ( the probability that a pair of individuals share 2 alleles IBD ) and Φ to determine relationships as described below for the VFHS families . The model was specified such that if Δ was equal to 0 . 25 , it was a sibling pair or DZ twin , and if φ was equal to 0 the pair were spouses . Multipoint IBD estimation was performed using the SNP genotypes and these values were used to estimate a linkage component of variance ( σ 2Q ) , though as there was only SNP data available these did not produce useful estimates and as such were not used in the final analyses . Variances were estimated in one model without genotype information as per the linear model in Equation 2 - 2 by specifying the mean with centred covariates as follows : ) 0599 . 25 ( ) 7933 . 39 ( − + + − + = bmi female age mean BMI sex age β β β µ ( 1 - 2 ) Variances were then estimated in a model with genotype information as a covariate as follows : SNP BMI sex age bmi female age mean β β β β µ + − + + − + = ) 0599 . 25 ( ) 7933 . 39 ( ( 1 - 3 ) where β SNP is the genotype coded as 0 , 1 or 2 . 3 Supplementary Table S1 .
