ORIGINAL ARTICLE Transducer of Cdc42 - dependent actin assembly promotes breast cancer invasion and metastasis H Chander 1 , P Truesdell 1 , J Meens 1 and AWB Craig 1 , 2 Metastatic breast adenocarcinomas display activation signatures for signaling pathways that trigger cell motility and tissue invasion . Here , we report that the adaptor protein transducer of Cdc42 - dependent actin assembly - 1 ( Toca - 1 ) is expressed in highly invasive breast cancers and regulates their metastatic phenotypes . We show that Toca - 1 localizes to the ﬁlamentous actin - rich core of invadopodial protrusions actively degrading the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . Toca - 1 colocalizes with Cortactin , and we show that this interaction is mediated by the SH3 domain of Toca - 1 . Stable knockdown ( KD ) of Toca - 1 expression in MDA - MB - 231 cells led to a signiﬁcant defect in epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) - induced cell migration and invasion . Toca - 1 KD cells also showed signiﬁcant defects in EGF - and Src - induced ECM digestion and formation of invadopodial membrane protrusions . To test the role of Toca - 1 in metastasis , we achieved stable Toca - 1 KD in both human and rat metastatic breast adenocarcinoma cell lines . Orthotopic tumor xenografting of control and Toca - 1 KD cells in natural - killer / B - / T - cell - deﬁcient mice revealed a signiﬁcant defect in spontaneous lung metastases with Toca - 1 silencing in vivo . In contrast , no defects in primary tumor growth or lung seeding following tail vein injection of Toca - 1 KD cells was observed , suggesting that Toca - 1 functions at an early step in the dissemination of metastatic breast tumor cells . Taken together , our results identify Toca - 1 as a proinvasive protein in breast adenocarcinoma and a potential therapeutic target to limit tumor metastasis .

We recently reported that Toca - 1 is required for maximal EGF - induced cell motility and invasion of A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells . 26 The current study investigates the role of Toca - 1 in regulating breast cancer migration , invasion and metastasis .

Toca - 1 is also expressed in both normal breast tissue , primarily in the ductal epithelium , and in invasive ductal carcinomas . In MDA - MB - 231 cells , Toca - 1 interacts with actin regulatory proteins , including an SH3 domain - mediated binding to Cortactin . Similarly to Cortactin , Toca - 1 localizes within the F - actin core of invadopodia that are actively degrading ECM . To test the function of Toca - 1 , we used stable silencing of Toca - 1 in MDA - MB - 231 cells to show that Toca - 1 promotes EGF - induced cell migration and invasion by promoting the formation of invadopo - dia . To study the role of Toca - 1 in metastasis , we performed orthotopic xenografting of breast cancer cell lines with a range of metastatic potential . Although Toca - 1 silencing had no signiﬁcant effect on primary tumor growth , we observed a signiﬁcant reduction in lung metastases . Taken together , these ﬁndings identify Toca - 1 as a component of invadopodia that promotes cell migration and invasion in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo . RESULTS Toca - 1 expression in breast cancer cells and tumors Although Toca - 1 expression has been noted in several breast cancer cell lines , 33 , 34 the potential roles of Toca - 1 in breast cancer have not been reported . We compared Toca - 1 transcript levels in immortalized breast epithelial cell lines and a panel of luminal and TNBC cell lines by quantitative reverse transcription – PCR . Although Toca - 1 expression was detectable in immortalized human breast epithelial HBL - 100 cell line , we observed increased Toca - 1 expression in luminal ( MCF - 7 ) and TNBC cell lines ( MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - MB - 435 , MDA - MB - 453 , MDA - MB - 468 and Hs578T ; Figure 1a ) . To test Toca - 1 protein levels , lysates from a similar panel of cell lines were subjected to immunoblot with Toca - 1 antisera . Toca - 1 levels were lowest in normal breast epithelial HBL - 100 cells , at slightly higher levels in luminal cell lines ( MCF - 7 , T47D , SK - BR - 3 ) and at high levels in most TNBC cell lines ( Figure 1b ; Actin served as a loading control ) . Thus , Toca - 1 is expressed in human breast epithelial cells and at higher levels in several invasive TNBC cell lines . To examine Toca - 1 expression in normal human breast tissues and tumors , we performed immunohistochemistry staining of Toca - 1 in tissue microarrays . To ensure that the signals correspond to Toca - 1 expression , we validated the speciﬁcity of rabbit Toca - 1 antisera by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry on breast cancer cells and xenograft tumors , with or without Toca - 1 silencing ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . In normal breast tissues , Toca - 1 expression was primarily detected in the ductal epithelium , with very low levels in the mammary stroma ( Figure 1c ) . Invasive ductal carcinomas from patients with lymph node involvement showed a range of Toca - 1 expression , with moderate to high expression in 70 % of tumors ( Figure 1c ) . Taken together , these results show that Toca - 1 is frequently overexpressed in metastatic breast tumors . Toca - 1 interacts with Cortactin and other actin regulatory proteins in MDA - MB - 231 cells To test whether Toca - 1 associates with actin regulatory proteins in TNBC cells , and whether EGFR signaling is involved , we chose the well - studied MDA - MB - 231 cell line . Cells were treated with or without EGF ( 5min ) and lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation ( IP ) with control or Toca - 1 antibodies . Several known binding partners of Toca - 1 were detected , including Dynamin , Abi1 and N - WASP ( Figure 2a ; data not shown ) . In addition , the p34 Arc subunit of Arp2 / 3 complex and Cortactin were detected in Toca - 1 IPs , but not with control IgG ( Figure 2a ) . However , EGF treatment had no effect on the levels or recovery of these Toca - 1 - associated proteins . As Cortactin has not been previously reported to associate with Toca - 1 , we performed the reciprocal co - IP experiment , and detected Toca - 1 in Cortactin IPs , but not those with control IgG ( Figure 2b ) . These results are consistent with Toca - 1 interacting directly or indirectly with Cortactin , a key component of invadopodia in MDA - MB - 231 cells . 36 To identify the domains of Toca - 1 that contribute to binding of Cortactin , we performed cotransfections of green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged Cortactin with red ﬂuorescent protein ( RFP ) - tagged Toca - 1 in HEK293T cells . We observed co - IP of RFP - Toca - 1 with GFP - Cortactin and not GFP control ( Figure 2c , compare lanes 5 and 6 ) . This interaction was maintained with an HR1 domain mutant ( MGD / IST ) , but lost upon disruption of the SH3 domain ( W518K ) ( Figure 2c , compare lanes 6 – 8 ) . These differences were not due to altered expression of RFP - Toca - 1 mutants or differential recovery of GFP - Cortactin . These results suggest that the SH3 domain of Toca - 1 is required for Cortactin binding . To test whether the SH3 domain was sufﬁcient , we performed pull - down assays using lysates from MDA - MB - 231 cells that were incubated with beads containing either glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) or GST fused to the Toca - 1 SH3 domain . Endogenous Cortactin was recovered with the Toca - 1 SH3 domain as the bait , compared with Figure 1 . Toca - 1 expression in human breast cell lines and tumors . ( a ) Quantitative reverse transcription – PCR analysis of Toca - 1 mRNA expression in immortalized , normal breast epithelial cell lines ( HBL - 100 ) , luminal ( MCF - 7 ) and TNBC cell lines ( MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - MB - 435 , MDA - MB - 453 , MDA - MB - 468 , Hs578T ) . 2 (cid:2) DD C T values for Toca - 1 were normalized to GAPDH for each cell line , and graph depicts transcript levels relative to HBL - 100 cells ( mean ± s . d . ; triplicate samples ) . ( b ) Lysates from a similar panel of cell lines were subjected to immunoblot ( IB ) with Toca - 1 and b - Actin antisera . Positions of molecular mass markers are shown on the left . ( c ) Immunohisto - chemistry for Toca - 1 was performed on tumor tissue microarrays as described in Materials and Methods . Representative micrographs for normal human breast tissue and invasive ductal carcinomas with low , moderate and high Toca - 1 expression are shown ( n ¼ 54 tumors analyzed ) . Toca - 1 promotes breast cancer metastasis H Chander et al 3081 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2013 ) 3080 – 3090 minimal recovery with GST control ( Figure 2d ) . Taken together , these results identify Cortactin as a novel binding partner of Toca - 1 ( via the SH3 domain ) , and provides yet another link between Toca - 1 and actin regulatory pathways . Toca - 1 localizes to invadopodia in breast cancer cells To study Toca - 1 localization in breast cancer cells , MDA - MB - 231 cells were cotransfected with Toca - 1 - RFP and GFP - Cortactin constructs . 25 , 37 Phalloidin staining was also performed to visualize F - actin structures . Confocal microscopy revealed Toca - 1 localization in the perinuclear region , and in puncta within the cytoplasm and cell periphery ( Figure 3a ) . Invadopodia form in the perinuclear region of MDA - MB - 231 cells , and are marked by F - actin dots , Cortactin and MT1 - MMP . 36 Toca - 1 showed extensive colocalization with Cortactin and F - actin dots in the perinuclear region ( Figure 3a , see arrows ; right panel shows co - localized pixels from all three channels ; E 30 % colocalization of Toca - 1 , Cortactin and F - actin was observed ) . The orthogonal views provide further support for colocalization of GFP - Cortactin and RFP - Toca - 1 in columns that mostly emanate from the ventral cell surface ( Figure 3b , see merge and x – z panels ) . Given previous studies on Cortactin as a key marker of invadopodia , 36 these results are consistent with Toca - 1 localization to invadopodia in breast cancer cells . To test whether endogenous Toca - 1 localizes to invadopodia actively degrading ECM , we used MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing activated Src ( MDA - Src ) that form clusters of invadopodia at the cell periphery , similar to rosettes described for Src - induced podosomes . 33 , 36 Toca - 1 and Cortactin localization was analyzed by immunoﬂuorescence in MDA - Src cells plated on coverslips coated with ﬂuorescent ECM . Confocal micrographs at the ventral surface of the cells revealed rosettes of invadopodia marked with Cortactin dots at the cell periphery ( Figure 3c ) . Endogenous Toca - 1 was detected within these invadopodia marked with Cortactin , which colocalized with zones of active ECM digestion ( Figure 3d , see x – z and y – z panels ) . Orthogonal views through a cluster of invadopodia show that Toca - 1 partially colocalized with Cortactin in the F - actin - rich core of invadopodia protruding into the ECM ( Figure 3d , see high magniﬁcation view of x – z panels ) . Together , these results identify Toca - 1 as a novel component of invadopo - dia , which may contribute to localized activation of actin nucleation promoting factors within these F - actin - rich structures . Toca - 1 promotes invadopodia formation , migration and invasion of breast cancer cells To study the function of Toca - 1 in MDA - MB - 231 cells , we established stable Toca - 1 knockdown ( KD ) cell pools using two separate short hairpin RNAs ( shRNAs ) or a control lentiviral vector , as previously described for A431 cells . 26 We observed an almost complete depletion of Toca - 1 protein in lysates from MDA - KD1 cells , and partial depletion in MDA - KD2 , compared with levels in vector control ( MDA - vec ) cell lysates ( Figure 4a ) . The silencing of Toca - 1 did not alter CIP4 or FBP17 expression ( data not shown ) , or EGF - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR ( pY - EGFR ; Figure 4b ) . As Toca - 1 localizes to invadopodia ( Figure 3 ) , we tested whether Toca - 1 silencing alters EGF - induced invadopodia formation in MDA - MB - 231 cells . MDA - vec and Toca - 1 KD cells were plated on coverslips coated with ﬂuorescent ECM , and treated with or without EGF for 36 h . After performing F - actin staining , epiﬂuorescence micrographs for EGF - treated cells show Figure 2 . Toca - 1 associates with actin regulatory proteins in breast cancer cells . ( a ) Serum - starved MDA - MB - 231 cells were treated with or without EGF ( 12 . 5n M ) for 5min . Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation ( IP ) with mouse anti - Toca - 1 or a control mouse IgG ( Ctl IgG ) before performing immunoblot ( IB ) with the indicated antibodies . ( b ) Lysates prepared as above were subjected to IP with mouse anti - Cortactin or Ctl IgG and IB performed with indicated antibodies .

( d ) MDA - MB - 231 cell lysates were subjected to pull - down assays with GST or GST - Toca - 1 SH3 domain conjugated to beads , followed by IB with Cortactin and GST antisera . Positions of molecular mass markers are shown on the left . Toca - 1 promotes breast cancer metastasis H Chander et al 3082 Oncogene ( 2013 ) 3080 – 3090 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited small areas of ECM digestion for both cell lines ( Figure 4c ) . A qualitative comparison of the control and Toca - 1 KD cells showed that fewer EGF - treated cells were actively degrading ECM ( Figure 4c ; 30 % for control and 9 % for Toca - 1 KD , data not shown ) . In addition , quantitative analysis of the ECM degradation area per cell revealed a signiﬁcant defect in Toca - 1 KD cells compared with control cells ( Figure 4d ) . These results suggest that Toca - 1 is a positive regulator of invadopodia . As invadopodia promote cell migration and invasion , 36 , 38 we tested whether Toca - 1 silencing alters these cellular responses . EGF treatment led to increased migration of vector control cells , but signiﬁcantly less motile cells were detected for Toca - 1 KD1 and KD2 cell lines ( Figure 4e ) . As both shRNAs used to silence Toca - 1 have the same effect , this suggests that the defects are due to Toca - 1 silencing and not potential off - target effects . Moreover , the extent of the motility defect correlated with the extent of Toca - 1 depletion in KD1 and KD2 cell lines ( Figures 4a and e ) . As KD1 was most effective , all subsequent experiments were performed comparing vector and KD1 cell pools . We next examined the contribution of Toca - 1 to invasion of MDA - MB - 231 cells through a layer of Matrigel ( BD Biosciences , Mississauga , ON , Canada ) using transwell chambers . EGF treat - ment of MDA - vec cells promoted their invasion through Matrigel , and this response was signiﬁcantly reduced in Toca - 1 KD cells ( Figure 4f ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings identify Toca - 1 as a positive regulator of invadopodia formation or maturation that promotes breast cancer cell migration and invasion . Toca - 1 silencing impairs Src - induced invadopodia in MDA - MB - 231 cells To test whether Toca - 1 is also functioning in invadopodia induced by activated Src , we performed stable silencing of Toca - 1 in MDA - Src cells , which showed an almost complete depletion of Toca - 1 ( Figure 5a ; actin served as a loading control ) . MDA - Src cells show a more uniformly invasive phenotype , with more invadopodia per cell and more rapid digestion of ECM . 33 , 36 MDA - Src vector and Toca - 1 KD cells were plated on coverslips coated with ﬂuorescent ECM overnight , followed by staining of F - actin . Epiﬂuorescence micrographs show extensive formation of invadopodia marked by F - actin dots over zones of ECM digestion ( Figure 5b ) . Although ECM digestion and invadopodia were detected in Toca - 1 KD MDA - Src cells ( Figure 5b ) , there was a signiﬁcant defect in the percentage of actively degrading cells ( Figure 5c ) and in the amount of ECM digestion compared with control cells ( Figure 5d ) . To ensure that these defects were caused by Toca - 1 depletion , we performed rescue experiments by transfecting MDA - Src - KD cells with an shRNA - resistant GFP - Toca - 1 plasmid . Compared with transfection with GFP control vector , which showed low levels of ECM digestion , we observed a signiﬁcant increase in ECM digestion in cells with restored expression of GFP - Toca - 1 ( Figure 5e , see Figure 5f for quantiﬁcation ) . Taken together , these results suggest that Toca - 1 signals downstream of EGFR and Src to promote invadopodia formation and / or maturation in breast cancer cells . Toca - 1 promotes formation of invadopodial protrusions As Toca - 1 is linked to actin nucleation promoting factor activation pathways , 18 , 21 we tested the formation of F - actin - rich invadopodial protrusions through 1 - m m pores as recently described . 39 For MDA - Src - vec control cells , we observed frequent formation of invadopodial protrusions through the pores , whereas few pores had invadopodial protrusions in Toca - 1 KD cells ( Figure 6a ; see arrows ) . Quantiﬁcation of these results showed a signiﬁcant defect in F - actin - based protrusions through pores present below Toca - 1 KD cells compared with vector control ( Figure 6b ) . Similar assays were performed on MDA - vec and MDA - KD cells treated with or without EGF , with similar defects observed upon Toca - 1 silencing ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that Toca - 1 localization to invadopodia promotes F - actin nuclea - tion pathways to drive or support membrane protrusions . Figure 3 .

Toca - 1 promotes breast cancer metastasis H Chander et al 3083 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2013 ) 3080 – 3090 Toca - 1 promotes breast tumor metastasis to the lungs To investigate contributions of Toca - 1 to breast cancer metastasis , we performed mammary fat pad xenografting of control and Toca - 1 KD breast cell lines in Rag2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) g c (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . A recent study demonstrated that the natural killer cell deﬁciency in this model is ideal to study spontaneous lung metastases of rat mammary adenocarinoma MTLn3 - PL ( expressing GFP ) and MTLn3 - B1 cells ( expressing GFP and human EGFR ) . 40 We performed these experiments with weakly metastatic MDA - MB - 231 cells ( expressing GFP ) , moderately metastatic MTLn3 - PL cells and highly metastatic MTLn3 - B1 cells . Using a similar silencing approach , we achieved an almost complete depletion of rat Toca - 1 in MTLn3 - PL and MTLn3 - B1 cells ( Figure 7a ) . The vector control and Toca - 1 KD cell pools from each cell line were injected into the mammary fat pads of 5 – 7 - week - old female Rag2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) g c (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . After 4 – 5 weeks ( 4 weeks was optimal for MTLn3 - B1 cells , 5 weeks for MTLn3 - PL and MDA - MB - 231 cells ) , mammary tumors were removed following euthanasia . We observed no signiﬁcant defects in tumor mass with Toca - 1 KD ( Figure 7b ) . We also conﬁrmed that Toca - 1 silencing was maintained in vivo , as tumor homogenates from Toca - 1 KD cells showed a substantial decrease in Toca - 1 compared with vector control tumors for each cell system ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . Further analysis of lung tissues revealed GFP - positive metastases for all three cell lines ( Figure 7c ) . The numbers and size of the metastases were reduced in lungs from mice injected with Toca - 1 KD cells ( Figure 7c ) . Quantiﬁcation of these lung metastases revealed a reproducible and signiﬁcant decrease in metastases in mice injected with Toca - 1 KD cells Figure 4 . Stable silencing of Toca - 1 impairs EGF - induced invadopodia formation , migration and invasion of MDA - MB - 231 cells . ( a ) MDA - MB - 231 cells transduced with vector ( vec ) , Toca - 1 shRNA1 ( KD1 ) or Toca - 1 shRNA2 ( KD2 ) were treated Toca - 1 levels by immunoblot ( IB ) with Toca - 1 and Actin antisera . ( b ) MDA - vec and MDA - KD1 cells were treated with or without EGF ( 12 . 5n M ) for 5min and lysates prepared for IB with active EGFR ( pY - EGFR ) and pan EGFR antisera . ( c ) MDA - MB - 231 and Toca - 1 KD cells were seeded on TRITC - FN coverslips for 36h in the presence and absence of EGF ( 12 . 5n M ) before F - actin staining .

Toca - 1 promotes breast cancer metastasis H Chander et al 3084 Oncogene ( 2013 ) 3080 – 3090 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited ( Figure 7d ) . As expected , the number of metastases was highest in mice with MTLn3 - B1 cell - derived mammary tumors , but Toca - 1 silencing caused a signiﬁcant reduction in lung metastases ( Figure 7e ) . To conﬁrm that GFP - positive signals in whole lung coincide with metastatic nodules , we analyzed lung tissue sections , which showed numerous metastases for mice with MTLn3 - B1 - vector tumors ( Figure 7f ) . Fewer and smaller nodules were evident in lung sections for mice with MTLn3 - B1 - Toca - 1 KD tumors ( Figure 7f ) , and quantiﬁcation revealed a signiﬁcant reduction in metastases with Toca - 1 silencing ( Figure 7g ) .

Toca - 1 promotes breast cancer metastasis H Chander et al 3085 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2013 ) 3080 – 3090 results demonstrate that silencing of Toca - 1 renders highly metastatic breast cancer cells less invasive in both cell - based assays and mouse models . To determine whether Toca - 1 KD impairs the ability of breast cancer cells to extravasate and colonize the lung , we performed experimental metastasis assays using MTLn3 - B1 vector control and Toca - 1 KD cells . Cells were injected into the lateral tail veins of 5 – 7 - week - old female Rag2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) g c (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice , and 2 weeks later lungs were excised and examined for metastases . Fluorescence micrographs revealed extensive GFP - positive lung metastases for both vector control and Toca - 1 KD cells ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . Quantiﬁcation of these lung metastases from multiple mice revealed no statistically signiﬁcant difference between control and Toca - 1 KD cells . These results suggest that Toca - 1 is not required for seeding or colonization of the lung , and suggest that Toca - 1 functions in early steps of tumor cell dissemination . DISCUSSION In this study , we report novel ﬁndings linking the F - BAR protein Toca - 1 to promoting invasion and metastasis of breast adenocarcinomas . Basal - like breast cancers are frequently meta - static , with activated EGFR and Src signaling pathways that induce invadopodia formation and promote metastasis . 10 , 12 , 40 , 41 In this paper , we report that Toca - 1 is highly expressed in human breast tumors , and that Toca - 1 associates with a number of actin regulatory proteins linked to invadopodia formation . We have identiﬁed Cortactin as a novel Toca - 1 - binding partner ( via the SH3 domain of Toca - 1 ) , and show that these proteins colocalize within active zones of ECM digestion . Toca - 1 localizes to the F - actin / Cortactin - rich core that supports invadopodial protrusions , and likely promotes actin branching in these structures . Toca - 1 function in basal breast cancer cells was tested by stable silencing of Toca - 1 , which impaired EGF - induced migration and invasion through Matrigel . This defect is likely due to reduced EGF - and Src - induced invadopodia in Toca - 1 KD cells , leading to impaired ECM digestion . This also correlated with reduced F - actin - based protrusions in Toca - 1 KD cells . Interestingly , the stable silencing of Toca - 1 was maintained in tumor xenografting studies in mice , and we found that Toca - 1 promotes spontaneous metastasis of breast adenocarcinomas from the mammary gland to the lung . This ﬁnding was observed for both weakly metastatic and highly metastatic breast adenocarcinoma cell lines . In experimental metastasis assays , Toca - 1 silencing had no effect on lung seeding efﬁciency , suggesting that Toca - 1 functions at an early step in tumor metastasis . Collectively , our study identiﬁes Toca - 1 as a key node in the pathways promoting invasion and metastasis in breast cancer . Figure 6 . Toca - 1 promotes the formation of invadopodial protrusions . ( a ) MDA - Src and Toca - 1 knockdown cells were plated on ﬁlters with 1 - m m pores .

Toca - 1 promotes breast cancer metastasis H Chander et al 3086 Oncogene ( 2013 ) 3080 – 3090 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited As an F - BAR adaptor protein , Toca - 1 is likely functioning as a scaffold for directing the recruitment of actin regulatory proteins involved in actin branching and nucleation pathways . 21 , 29 As most F - BAR domains induce or stabilize membrane invaginations , 42 , 43 the recruitment mechanisms for Toca - 1 to membrane protrusions , such as lamellipodia , ﬁlopodia or invadopodia , are not well deﬁned 25 , 26 ( this study ) . This may be directed by protein – protein interactions with Toca - 1 , or possibly by F - BAR domain sensing of membrane curvature at the neck of the ventral membrane protrusions . A similar mechanism was recently reported to direct the F - BAR protein Pacsin - 2 / Syndapin - II to the base of the ﬁlopodia . 44 Both Toca - 1 and Pacsin - 2 induce ﬁlopodia formation , 25 , 44 which may involve assembly of the branched actin base on which the bundled actin core is polymerized by formins . 29 The precise role of Toca - 1 within invadopodia awaits further studies , including the contributions of the F - BAR , HR1 and SH3 domains to its function in actin assembly and localization . In addition , the potential contributions of other F - BAR proteins to the dynamics of membrane remodeling and actin polymerization within invadopodia have begun to emerge in recent studies . 33 – 35 FBP17 was identiﬁed as a positive regulator of invadopodia in bladder cancer cells , and this required the F - BAR and SH3 domains , which may promote recruitment of Dynamin - 2 . 35 As FBP17 and Toca - 1 are both capable of inducing actin polymerization on curved membranes via activation of the Cdc42 / N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 complex , 23 it is possible that these proteins are partially redundant in their functions . Another component of invadopodia in breast cancer cells is CIP4 , which Figure 7 . Toca - 1 promotes lung metastasis of mammary adenocarcinomas in mice .

Toca - 1 promotes breast cancer metastasis H Chander et al 3087 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2013 ) 3080 – 3090 has been reported to have both positive and negative roles in these structures . 33 , 34 Pichot et al . 34 reported a loss of invadopodia and defects in migration and invasion in CIP4 KD MDA - MB - 231 cells . Our laboratory used a stable silencing of CIP4 in both MDA and MDA - Src cells , which led to increased invadopodia formation and ECM degradation . 33 This inhibitory effect of CIP4 correlated with elevated surface levels of MT1 - MMP in CIP4 KD cells , suggesting that CIP4 may regulate invadopodia via inter - nalization of MT1 - MMP . 33 A recent study of CIP4 subfamily proteins in actin pepestal formation by enterohemorrhagic E . coli found distinct roles for CIP4 , FBP17 and Toca - 1 . 45 Interestingly , CIP4 inhibited these F - actin - based structures , whereas Toca - 1 promoted pedestal formation , 45 which is consistent with our ﬁndings for these proteins in invadopodia ( Hu et al . , 33 and this paper ) . Further studies using experimental models of breast cancer metastasis , such as the model reported here for Toca - 1 , should help resolve the contributions of CIP4 to this process . Our ﬁndings identify Toca - 1 as a key node in cell invasion and metastasis mechanisms of invasive breast adenocarcinomas . This has important implications for proper regulation of Toca - 1 expression levels and for its scaffolding function . It is worth noting that gene expression proﬁling of breast tumor cells identiﬁed Cdc42 and Arp2 / 3 upregulation in highly invasive cells compared with less invasive cells from the same tumor . 46 , 47 These proinvasive proteins likely require Toca - 1 to promote metastasis in these tumor cells . Thus , it will be important to test whether Toca - 1 expression is also altered in tumor metastases , and how Toca - 1 expression levels are controlled in normal epithelial cells and metastatic cancer cells . The recent ﬁnding that F - BAR proteins are potentially autoinhibited by their SH3 domains binding to the F - BAR domain 48 , 49 provides another potential mode of regulation for this protein family . It will be interesting to determine whether these mechanisms apply to Toca - 1 , and whether this autoinhibition is lost in highly invasive cancer cells with high levels of active Cdc42 and actin regulatory proteins . Our study provides the ﬁrst evidence that Toca - 1 has a causal role in tumor metastasis , and is therefore a potential therapeutic target in metastatic breast cancer . As metastasis is the leading cause of cancer - related deaths , it will be important to further characterize this EGFR / Src / Cdc42 / Toca - 1 signaling pathway in other metastatic cancer models . Our experiments demonstrate that depletion of Toca - 1 inhibits spontaneous metastasis of breast adenocarcinomas with low or high metastatic potential . As these basal - like TNBCs are highly aggressive and have worse prognosis compared with other subtypes , 50 alternative therapeutic approaches are needed . Our study identiﬁes Toca - 1 as a key node in signaling pathways linked to tumor progression and metastasis . Future studies will be required to develop tools to limit Toca - 1 expression or block Toca - 1 signaling to actin regulatory proteins in metastatic cancers . This study adds Toca - 1 to the growing list of key regulators of invadopodia that promote cell invasion and tumor metastasis . 51 Inhibitors to several components of invadopodia including Src kinase and MT1 - MMP have shown promise in preclinical models of breast cancer . 41 , 52 , 53 MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies and reagents Noncommercial antibodies included mouse anti - Toca - 1 28 and rabbit anti - CIP4 . 33 Commercial antibodies included rabbit anti - Toca - 1 ( EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) , mouse anti - Cortactin ( Upstate Biotech , Lake Placid , NY , USA ) , rabbit anti - p34 - Arc ( EMD Millipore ) , rabbit anti - EGFR ( Santa Cruz Biotech , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , mouse anti - active EGFR ( BD Biosciences ) , mouse anti - GST ( Sigma - Aldrich , Oakville , ON , Canada ) , mouse anti - b - actin ( Santa Cruz Biotech ) , mouse anti - Dynamin ( Upstate Biotech . ) , dsRed antibody for RFP ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA , USA ) , rabbit anti - Erk , mouse , normal mouse and rabbit IgG ( Santa Cruz Biotech ) . Secondary antibodies included Alexa Fluor 488 - or Alexa Fluor 633 - conjugated goat anti - mouse / rabbit IgG ( Life Technologies Inc . , Burlington , ON , Canada ) . F - actin staining was performed using either Alexa Fluor 488 - or 350 - conjugated phalloidin ( Life Technologies Inc . ) . Other materials included gelatin , ﬁbronectin and bovine serum albumin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , human and murine EGF ( Peprotech , Rocky Hill , NJ , USA ) , transwell chambers ( 8 and 1 m m pore size ) and growth factor - reduced Matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) . Quantitative reverse transcription – PCR assays Immortalized human breast epithelial cells ( HBL - 100 ) and human luminal type ( MCF - 7 , T47D , SK - BR - 3 ) and TNBC cell lines ( MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - MB - 435 , MDA - MB - 453 , MDA - MB - 468 and Hs578T ) were harvested for total RNA extraction according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( RNeasy Plus mini kit , Qiagen , Inc . , Mississauga , ON , Canada ) . cDNA synthesis was performed with random hexamer primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase ( Life Technologies Inc . ) . Quantitative PCR was performed on cDNA using human Toca - 1 primers ( Forward primer 5 0 - CAAACCAGGAAGTCCGTGGGCC - 3 0 ; Reverse primer 5 0 - ATGTCACACATGGCACAAAGGTGC - 3 0 ) and GAPDH pri - mers ( Forward primer 5 0 - GCCTTCCGTGTCCCCACTGC - 3 0 ; Reverse primer 5 0 - CAATGCCAGCCCCAGCGTCA - 3 0 ) and the SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix kit ( Sigma - Aldrich ; 58 1 C annealing , 40 cycles , BioRad iCycler , Bio - Rad Laboratories , Mississauga , ON , Canada ) . Transcript levels were analyzed using the 2 (cid:2) DD C T method . 54 Toca - 1 mRNA levels were ﬁrst normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels in each sample , and expressed as relative values to that observed for HBL - 100 cells ( set at 1 ) . Cell culture and transfections MDA - MB - 231 cells and a derivative expressing Src - Y527F ( MDA - Src ) cells were described previously . 33 Both lines were grown in DMEM supple - mented with 10 % FBS , 1 % antibiotics and 1 % glutamine ( Invitrogen ) at 37 1 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 . MTLn3 , MTLn3 - PL and MTLn3 - B1 cells and their culture conditions were described previously 12 ( kindly provided by Jeffrey Segall , Albert Einstein College of Medicine ) . MDA - MB - 231 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP - Cortactin , GFP - Toca - 1 , mRFP - Toca - 1 25 , 37 , 42 , 55 using Xtremegene HP DNA ( Roche Diagnostics , Laval , QC , Canada ) in serum and antibiotic - free media for 8h , followed by replacement with complete media for 40h . HEK293T cells were cotransfected for 48h with GFP - Cortactin , mRFP - Toca - 1 and its domain mutants using Trans - LT1 transfection reagent ( Mirus Biocorporation , Madison , WI , USA ) for co - IP studies . Generation of stable Toca - 1 KD cell lines Lentiviral transduction of MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - Src , MTLn3 - PL and MTLn3 - B1 cells with vector or Toca - 1 - speciﬁc shRNAs was performed essentially as described previously . 26 In MDA cells , KD1 refers to clone ‘C12’ ( 5 0 - GAACAG AACTATGCGAAACAA - 3 0 ; TRCN0000130069 ; Open Biosystems , Lafayette , CO , USA ) , whereas KD2 refers to clone ‘D1’ ( 5 0 - CCATTTCTGATGGGACTATCA - 3 0 ; TRCN0000130220 ; Open Biosystems ) . In MTLn3 - PL and MTLn3 - B1 cells , Toca - 1 KD refers to clone ‘C12’ , which has perfect complementarity to rat Toca - 1 . Cell pools that survived puromycin selection were propagated for several passages , along with cell pools stably selected with an equal titer of the lentiviral pLKO . 1 vector . The efﬁciency of Toca - 1 KD was assessed over several passages by immunoblot using mouse anti - Toca - 1 and anti - actin as a loading control . Rescue experiments were performed using a Toca - 1 construct ( pLVX - puro - based ) expressing human Toca - 1 with several silent mutations in the C12 shRNA target sequence that we previously described 26 fused at the C - terminus to GFP ( pLVX - GFP - puro served as a negative control ) . Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting To identify Toca - 1 - associated proteins , MDA - MB - 231 cells were starved overnight with serum - free medium before treatment with or without EGF ( 12 . 5n M ) for 5min . Cells were lysed and subjected to IP with mouse anti - Toca - 1 or mouse anti - Cortactin . Following recovery of IP complexes using GammaBind - Sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare , Mississauga , ON , Canada ) , and washing , bound proteins were resolved by SDS – PAGE . Following transfer of proteins to Immobilon P membranes ( Millipore ) using a semidry transfer method ( BioRad ) , immunoblot with indicated antibodies was carried out followed by appropriate horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies , and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence ( Perkin Elmer , Woodbridge , ON , Canada ) . Toca - 1 promotes breast cancer metastasis H Chander et al 3088 Oncogene ( 2013 ) 3080 – 3090 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited Migration and invasion assays Invasion assays were performed as described previously . 26 Brieﬂy , transwell inserts ( 8 m m pore ) were coated with 100 m l of ice - cold Matrigel ( 1 : 5 dilution in DMEM with 0 . 5 % FBS ) for invasion , and coated with 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) gelatin for migration assays and incubated at 37 1 C for 30min to solidify . A total of 50000 cells were added in the upper chamber , which was placed in a 24 - well plate containing EGF as a chemoattractant . After overnight incubation , the ﬁlters were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , cells and Matrigel on the top of the ﬁlter were removed and the cells attached to the underside of the ﬁlter were stained with DAPI . Epiﬂuorescence microscopy was performed to detect nuclei of cells that migrated to the underside of the ﬁlters . Scoring of migrating or invading cells from four separate ﬁelds was performed for triplicate ﬁlters using the Image Pro Plus software ( Media Cybernetics , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . Colocalization analysis The Image Pro - Plus software was used for analyzing colocalization of F - actin , Cortactin and Toca - 1 . Colocalization masks for F - actin / Cortactin were prepared and then overlayed with the Toca - 1 channel . Colocalization coefﬁcients were calculated for cotransfected cells ( n ¼ 10 cells ) . Extracellular matrix degradation assays MDA - MB - 231 vector and Toca - 1 KD cells were seeded on gelatin - coated glass coverslips ( 15000 cells ) containing a layer of TRITC - conjugated ﬁbronectin , prepared as described previously . 33 After incubation for 24 – 48h , cells were ﬁxed and stained with F - actin . Epiﬂuorescence microscopy was performed and the areas of ECM digestion underneath the cells stained with F - actin were quantiﬁed as digestion area per cell using the Image Pro Plus software . At least 100 cells were quantiﬁed for each condition and cell line . Invadopodium protrusion assay Invadopodium protrusion assays were performed in 1 - m m - pore size Transwell chambers coated with 0 . 1 % gelatin as described . 39 MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - Src vector and Toca - 1 KD cells were starved overnight and then plated in transwells for 24h ( MDA - MB - 231 cells ) or 16 – 18h for MDA - Src cells . Cells were ﬁxed and F - actin stained using Alexa ﬂuor - 488 phalloidin to identify protrusions . At least 10 different ﬁelds per condition were randomly imaged in each experiment using spinning disk confocal microscopy . Invadopodium protrusions were quantiﬁed as the percentage of total pores under the cells contraining F - actin - based protrusions . Orthogonal views and overlay images were prepared using Image Pro Plus . Immunohistochemistry Toca - 1 expression in human breast tissues and tumors was assessed by immunohistochemistry on human breast tissue microarrays ( TMAs ; T086b and BR10010a ; US Biomax Inc , Rockville , MD , USA ) using the LSAB þ System - HRP ( Dako , Burlington , ON , Canada ) . Antigens were retrieved by heating at 94 1 C in 10m M sodium citrate , pH 6 . 0 , for 40min . After peroxidase treatment for 5min , samples were blocked in TBS / 2 % goat serum / 2 % BSA for 30min and incubated with rabbit anti - Toca - 1 antibody ( Millipore ) , diluted 1 : 100 in blocking buffer for 60min . The reaction was visualized using the goat anti - rabbit IgG biotinylated linker ( Dako ) for 20min followed by Streptavidin – horseradish peroxidase for 20min and the DAB solution for 3 – 4min . Tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin in ammonia water and mounted before imaging by microscopy . Each tumor tissue was analyzed using the H - score system on digitized scans of slides using the Aperio software ( Aperio , Vista , CA , USA ) . The H - score ( 0 – 300 ) is calculated as the sum of the percentage of tumor cells in each intensity category ( low , moderate and high Toca - 1 expression ) . 56 Orthotopic tumor xenografting assays Rag2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) g c (cid:2) / (cid:2) ( BALB / c ) mice that are deﬁcient in natural killer , B , and T cells were recently reported to be an optimal model for the detection of lung metastasis from orthotopic mammary tumor xenografts with MTLn3 cells . 40 Animals were housed in a speciﬁc pathogen - free facility ( Queen’s University Animal Care Services ) , with ventilated cages and sterilized food and water supply . All procedures with mice were approved by the Queen’s University Animal Care Committee . Control and Toca - 1 KD MDA - MB - 231 ( transduced with pLVXpuro - EGFP ) , MTLn3 - PL and MTLn3 - B1 cells were grown to 70 – 85 % conﬂuence before trypsinization and counting . For xenografting , 1 . 5 (cid:3) 10 6 MDA - MB - 231 , or 5 (cid:3) 10 5 for MTLn3 - PL and MTLn3 - ErbB1 cells , were injected into the right thoracic mammary fat pads of the Rag2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) g c (cid:2) / (cid:2) female mice in a volume of 100 m l of 50 % Matrigel using a hypodermic syringe . At end points of 4 weeks for MTLn3 - B1 , or 5 weeks for MTLn3 - PL and MDA - MB - 231 cells , mice were killed and primary tumor mass recorded . Several tissues were removed for detection of GFP þ metastases , which were primarily observed in the lungs . Lungs were excised , rinsed with cold PBS , placed ﬂat on a microscope slide and imaged with an epiﬂuorescent microscope ( (cid:3) 4 objective ) . The GFP - positive metastases were counted using the Image J software ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . The primary tumors and lungs from each mouse were used for histological analysis . Samples were ﬁxed in formalin and embedded in parafﬁn , and 5 m m sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin . Experimental lung metastasis assays For experimental lung metastasis assays , MDA - MB - 231 , MTLn3 - PL and MTLn3 - B1 control and Toca - 1 KD cells ( 2 (cid:3) 10 5 ) were injected into the lateral tail veins of 5 – 7 - week - old female Rag2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) g c (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . Two weeks later mice were killed , and the lungs were removed and subjected to ﬂuorescent imaging and histological examination . Statistical analysis Differences between the control and Toca - 1 KD cells were examined for statistical signiﬁcance ( * P o 0 . 05 , or * * P o 0 . 01 ) using a paired Student’s t - test in Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA , USA ) .
