We studied whether during platelet activation Rho - kinase stimulates LIM - kinase ( LIMK ) leading to subsequent phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin . Platelet shape change and aggregation / secretion were induced by low and high concentrations of thrombin , respectively . We found that during these platelet responses Rho kinase activation was responsible for mediating rapid Thr508 phosphorylation and activation of LIMK - 1 , and the F - actin increase during shape change and , in part , during secretion . Surprisingly , during shape change cofilin phosphorylation was unaltered , and during aggregation / secretion cofilin was first rapidly dephosphorylated by an okadaic acid - insensitive phosphatase and then slowly rephosphorylated by LIMK - 1 . LIMK - 1 phosphorylation and cofilin de - and rephosphorylation during aggregation were independent of integrin α IIb ß 3 engagement . Cofilin phosphorylation did not regulate cofilin association with F - actin and was unrelated to the F - actin increase in thrombin - activated platelets . Our study identifies LIMK - 1 being activated by Rho kinase in thrombin - stimulated platelets . Two counteracting pathways , a cofilin phosphatase and LIMK - 1 , are activated during platelet aggregation / secretion regulating cofilin phosphorylation sequentially and independently of integrin α IIb ß 3 engagement . Rho - kinase mediated F - actin increase during platelet shape change and secretion involves a mechanism other than LIMK - 1 mediated cofilin phosphorylation , raising the possibility of another LIMK - substrate regulating platelet actin assembly . For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 3 Introduction Dynamic remodeling of actin structures underlies the different morphological and functional platelet responses such as shape change , spreading , secretion and aggregation . 1 , 2 The remodeling of actin is mediated by factors that regulate actin polymerization and depolymerization , disassembly of existing filaments , formation of new filaments , crosslinking of filaments to networks , and bundling of actin filaments . 3 - 5 They include signaling proteins that regulate actin dynamics as well as proteins that bind directly to actin and modulate the diverse actin structures . A key protein regulating actin remodeling is cofilin 6 , 7 an essential , ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved actin - binding protein . Binding of cofilin to actin filaments stabilizes a twisted form of F - actin , thereby weakening lateral subunit interactions and promoting filament severing and depolymerization . 8 , 9 However , filament severing by cofilin also results in the generation of free barbed ends , which in turn is crucial for efficient enhancement of actin polymerization . 10 - 12 Cofilin is therefore an actin dynamizing protein , which favors depolymerization or polymerization of actin depending on the cellular content of actin filaments relative to actin monomers and free barbed ends . 13 In unstimulated cells cofilin is present both in a phosphorylated and a non - phosphorylated form . 14 , 15 The depolymerizing activity of cofilin and cofilin binding to actin are inhibited by its phosphorylation on Ser3 16 mediated by LIM - kinases ( LIMKs ) . 17 , 18 Two forms of LIM - kinase have been described , LIMK - 1 and LIMK - 2 . 19 Rho - like small GTPases such as Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 play a major role in regulating actin dynamics in stimulated cells . The kinase downstream of Rho - GTPase , the Rho - kinase ( p160ROCK ) , first isolated from platelets , 20 plays a major role in platelet shape change . 21 , 22 Rho - kinase directly phosphorylates the 130 - kD myosin phosphatase targeting subunit ( MYPT ) of myosin phosphatase , thereby inhibiting the catalytic subunit of the enzyme leading to an increase of myosin light chain phosphorylation . Phosphorylated myosin interacts with For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 4 actin filaments , and develops actin - activated adenosine triphosphatase ( ATPase ) activity . These properties of myosin are important for the contraction of the actin cytoskeleton during shape change and facilitate platelet secretion . 1 , 4 Based on in vitro and in vivo studies of transfected cells , it has been proposed that Rho - kinase also phosphorylates and activates LIMKs 23 leading to cofilin phosphorylation and stabilization of actin cytoskeletal structures . 17 LIMKs can also be phosphorylated by Rac - activated PAKs ( p21 activated kinases ) . 24 Both Rac 25 , 26 and PAK 27 , 28 are stimulated during platelet activation . So far it is not known , whether the LIMK / cofilin phosphorylation pathway is stimulated during physiological activation of platelets . Also , it is ambiguous whether Rho - mediated Rho - kinase activation or Rac - mediated PAK activation cause LIMK phosphorylation in physiologically activated platelets . We studied which forms of LIMK are expressed in platelets , whether LIMKs are activated upon platelet activation , and whether Rho - kinase is the kinase responsible for LIMK activation . We also analyzed whether LIMK activation leads to cofilin phosphorylation , and whether a Rho - kinase / LIM - kinase / cofilin pathway might regulate the increase of F - actin underlying platelet shape change and secretion / aggregation stimulated by thrombin . Our study identifies LIMK - 1 being rapidly activated by Rho - kinase during shape change and aggregation . However , cofilin phosphorylation did not change during shape change , and unexpectedly cofilin was rapidly and reversibly dephosphorylated during aggregation . Two counteracting pathways , a cofilin phosphatase and LIMK - 1 regulate cofilin phosphorylation differently during shape change and secretion .

Protein A - sepharose was prepared by incubating the beads in swelling buffer ( 20mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 15M NaCl , and 0 . 1 % NaN 3 ) containing 2 % BSA to block unspecific binding . Pre - cleared supernatants were incubated overnight with anti - LIMK - 1 antibody ( 1 : 50 dilution ) followed by addition of 80µl 50 % protein A - Sepharose slurry and incubation at 4°C for 1hr . The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 13 , 000rpm for 25sec , washed three times with 1ml of ice - cold 1x immunoprecipitation lysis buffer and processed for immunoblot analysis as described above or for the kinase assay . All steps were performed at 4°C . LIMK - 1 kinase assay The protein concentration of the immunoprecipitated samples was measured using dotMETRIC TM protein assay kit ( Geno Technology , Inc . , St . Louis , MO ) . For the kinase assay , equal amount of protein was added to 100µl of kinase buffer containing 50mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 5mM MgCl 2 , 10mM NaF 2 and 1mM Na 3 VO 4 .

For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 10 Results F - actin increase during thrombin - induced platelet shape change is mediated by Rho - kinase activation Washed platelets were stimulated with low concentrations of thrombin ( 0 . 075 U / ml ) to induce selectively platelet shape change , without platelet aggregation ( Fig . 1A ) and secretion ( data not shown ) . As observed previously , 22 shape change after this low concentration of thrombin was inhibited by Y - 27632 , indicating that shape change was mediated by Rho kinase activation . Thrombin induced in the same samples an increase in F - actin from 43±2 % of total in resting platelets to 55±3 % ( mean± SD , n = 4 ) 30 sec after thrombin stimulation which was inhibited by Y - 27632 ( Fig . 1B ) . Interestingly , Y - 27632 increased significantly the F - actin content in unstimulated platelets . In order to analyze Rho - kinase activation , phosphorylation of one of its substrates , the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit ( MYPT ) was measured . Thrombin induced a rapid irreversible increase of MYPT phosphorylation at Thr853 ( about 2 - fold ) during shape change ( Fig . 1C ) . The established Rho - kinase inhibitor Y - 27632 35 completely abolished the thrombin - induced increase of MYPT phosphorylation ( Fig . 1C ) . These results indicate that Rho - kinase is activated during shape change and mediates the F - actin increase underlying shape change . Rho - kinase stimulates LIMK - 1 during thrombin - induced shape change To analyze , how Rho - kinase activation regulates the increase of F - actin , the activation of LIM - kinases known to phosphorylate and inactivate cofilin was analyzed . We investigated first , whether platelets contain LIM - kinases , and which type of LIM - kinase is expressed in platelets . The polyclonal antibody we had produced against the recombinant kinase domain of LIMK - 2 recognized a specific band at 72 kDa in platelets ( data not shown ) . Since this antibody might not distinguish between LIMK - 1 and LIMK - 2 , specific peptide antibodies For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 11 against these two forms of LIMKs were used . The specificity of the anti - LIMK - 1 and anti - LIMK - 2 was probed by immunoblotting endothelial cells transfected with different GFP - LIMK - 2 constructs . The anti - LIMK - 2 antibody identified the different GFP - LIMK - 2 constructs at their respective positions in the immunoblot , while the anti - LIMK - 1 antibody did not ( data not shown ) . Only LIMK - 1 but not LIMK - 2 is expressed in platelets ( Fig . 2A ) . In contrast , endothelial cells contain both LIMK - 1 and LIMK - 2 . To explore , whether LIMK - 1 phosphorylation was increased during shape change , a specific anti - phospho - LIMK antibody was used , which recognizes the phosphorylated Thr508 in the kinase domain . LIMK - 1 - Thr508 phosphorylation increased during shape change , and LIMK - 1 phosphorylation was rapid and irreversible ( Fig . 2B ) . LIMK - 1 phosphorylation was slightly slower than MYPT phosphorylation ( compare with Fig . 1C ) . The specificity of the anti - phospho - LIMK antibody was probed using the respective unphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptide ( amino acids 500 - 512 ) of LIMK - 1 . Only the phosphorylated peptide blocked the signal of the phosphorylated LIMK - 1 on immunoblots of activated platelets ( data not shown ) . LIMK - 1 phosphorylation was completely Rho - kinase dependent , since it was abolished after platelet pre - incubation with Y - 27632 ( Fig . 2C ) . Regulation of cofilin phosphorylation and cofilin binding to F - actin in resting platelets and during shape change In resting platelets , one third of total cofilin is present in its phosphorylated form as measured after separation of these two forms by isoelectric focusing and subsequent cofilin immunoblot ( Fig . 2A ) . Preincubation of platelets with Y - 27632 completely inhibited basal LIMK - 1 phosphorylation and decreased cofilin phosphorylation ( Fig . 2C ) . We investigated , how cofilin phosphorylation was related to the amount of F - actin , and the amount of cofilin associated with F - actin in resting platelets . Inhibition of LIMK - 1 by Y - 27632 reduced cofilin For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 12 phosphorylation by 20 % ( Fig . 2C ) , increased F - actin , and increased cofilin association with F - actin in resting platelets ( Fig . 1B , Fig . 2B ) . Therefore , LIMK - 1 mediated cofilin phosphorylation might reduce F - actin and cofilin association with F - actin in resting platelets . Unexpectedly in spite of the rapid and pronounced LIMK - 1 phosphorylation , we could not observe a concomitant increase in cofilin phosphorylation during shape change ( Fig . 2B ) . After pretreatment with Y - 27632 , thrombin induced a decrease of cofilin phosphorylation ( from 76±10 % to 54±12 % of control , p < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 2C ) . These results suggest that cofilin dephosphorylation by a cofilin phosphatase might mask the concomitant stimulation of cofilin phosphorylation by LIMK - 1 during shape change . Confirming previous studies , 36 we found that cofilin only in its unphosphorylated form bound with F - actin in platelets , while the phosphorylated cofilin did not ( data not shown ) . Since there was no net increase in the phospho - cofilin pool during the shape change , where an increase of F - actin was observed , we wondered , whether the association of active unphosphorylated cofilin with F - actin was changed , and analyzed the cofilin association with F - actin at different time intervals during shape change . We found a significant small increase of cofilin ( about 5 % ) with platelet F - actin ( Fig . 3B ) . However , cofilin relative to F - actin did not increase as measured by the ratio of F - actin - associated cofilin with F - actin ( Fig . 3C ) . Furthermore , pre - treatment of platelets with Y - 27632 increased cofilin association with F - actin in resting platelets and inhibited the increase during shape change . Y - 27632 which resulted in cofilin dephosphorylation of 40 % 2 min after thrombin stimulation ( Fig . 2C ) , rather decreased than increased the association of cofilin with F - actin at this time point ( Fig . 3B , C ) . We conclude that the F - actin increase and the association of the small pool of cofilin with F - actin ( 5 % ) during shape change is regulated by a mechanism other than cofilin For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 13 phosphorylation . No association of LIMK - 1 and phospho - LIMK - 1 with the actin cytoskeleton could be detected in resting or activated platelets ( data not shown ) . Analysis of the Rho - kinase / LIMK - 1 pathway , cofilin phosphorylation , F - actin increase and cofilin / F - actin association during thrombin - induced platelet aggregation and / or secretion . LIMK - 1 phosphorylation and regulation of cofilin phosphorylation are independent of the integrin α IIb ß 3 . Platelets were stimulated with thrombin ( 0 . 5U / ml ) to induce platelet aggregation and secretion ( Fig . 4 ) . Since Rho - kinase phosphorylates myosin phosphatase targeting subunit ( MYPT ) not only at Thr853 , 37 but also at Thr696 38 both phosphorylation sites were measured after thrombin stimulation . Thrombin induced a rapid and reversible increase of MYPT phosphorylation at both Thr696 ( Fig . 5A ) and Thr853 ( not shown ) which was not only inhibited by Y - 27362 ( Fig . 6A ) , but also by the new specific Rho - kinase inhibitor H - 1152 39 ( 20µM ; data not shown ) . Y - 27632 inhibited thrombin - induced aggregation and secretion ( Fig . 4 ) . The Y - 27632 - mediated inhibition of secretion was also observed in the presence of RGDS indicating that inhibition of aggregation by Y - 27632 is due to inhibition of secretion . These results suggest a role of a Rho - kinase dependent pathway in platelet secretion . The reversible MYPT phosphorylation pattern during platelet aggregation was different from the irreversible time course of MYPT phosphorylation during shape change . MYPT phosphorylation even decreased under control levels in aggregated platelets ( Fig . 5A ) . These differences might be explained by an aggregation - dependent stimulation of dephosphorylation of MYPT at Thr696 and Thr853 . Indeed , the tetrapeptide RGDS , which blocks the integrin α IIb ß 3 and platelet aggregation , or the absence of stirring during platelet incubation with thrombin inhibited the dephosphorylation of MYPT at Thr696 and Thr853 completely For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 14 ( Fig . 5A , and data not shown ) . Therefore in thrombin - aggregated platelets , the increase of MYPT phosphorylation is due activation of Rho - kinase , and the rapid and pronounced decrease of MYPT phosphorylation is due to activation of a phosphatase acting on MYPT Thr696 and Thr853 phosphorylation sites that is activated by engagement of the integrin α IIb ß 3 . The increase of LIMK - 1 phosphorylation was higher during aggregation ( 13 - fold ) than during shape change ( 5 - fold ) ( compare Fig . 5B with Fig . 2B ) . The phosphorylation of LIMK - 1 in thrombin - stimulated platelets was Rho - kinase dependent , since it was completely inhibited by Y - 27632 and H - 1152 ( Fig . 6A ; and data not shown ) . Despite LIMK - 1 activation , cofilin phosphorylation rapidly decreased after thrombin stimulation of platelets . The decrease of cofilin phosphorylation was about 60 % 30sec after thrombin addition , and was followed by slow rephosphorylation ( Fig . 5C ) . LIMK - 1 phosphorylation during aggregation was independent of integrin α IIb β 3 engagement , since the pattern of LIMK - 1 phosphorylation was unchanged in the presence of RGDS or by the absence of platelet stirring ( Fig . 5B ) . Also the rapid dephosphorylation and subsequent slow rephosphorylation of cofilin were independent of outside - in signaling of the integrin α IIb β 3 ( Fig . 5C ) . In platelets preincubated with Y - 27632 and stimulated with thrombin , no change in the initial phase of cofilin dephosphorylation was observed , but the subsequent rephosphorylation of cofilin was completely blocked ( Fig . 6B ) . Similar results were obtained with the novel and specific Rho kinase inhibitor H - 1152 ( data not shown ) . To measure LIMK - 1 activity , LIMK - 1 was immunoprecipitated from thrombin - stimulated and unstimulated platelets , and LIMK - P immunoblots and kinase assays using the specific LIMK substrate cofilin were performed . Thrombin stimulated both LIMK - 1 phosphorylation and LIMK - 1 activity in platelets , both of which were inhibited by Y - 27632 ( Fig . 6C ) . Hence , these results strongly suggest that in For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 15 thrombin - stimulated platelets cofilin rephosphorylation is mediated by Rho - kinase - activation of LIMK - 1 . To explore , which type of phosphatase might be involved in the rapid dephosphorylation of cofilin after platelet stimulation with thrombin , platelets were incubated with okadaic acid , a PP1 / PP2A type phosphatase inhibitor . Okadaic acid did not inhibit cofilin dephosphorylation indicating that cofilin is not dephosphorylated by a PP1 / PP2A type phosphatase ( data not shown ) . Platelet aggregation and secretion is associated with a different actin reorganization in platelets as compared to shape change . 1 Since cofilin was rapidly dephosphorylated during platelet secretion independently of whether platelets aggregated or not ( Fig . 4 and Fig . 5C ) , we wondered , whether the association of cofilin with F - actin was increased . Experiments were performed in the presence of RGDS to avoid possible artifacts during isolation of platelet F - actin associated with platelet aggregation ( such as unspecific trapping of cofilin in aggregated platelets and inefficient lysis of platelet aggregates with Triton X - 100 ) . The presence of RGDS during stirring decreased F - actin in resting platelets as compared to control , but did not change cofilin phosphorylation and the association of cofilin with F - actin ( 8 % ) in resting platelets ( Fig . 1B , Fig . 3B , Fig . 7A , B , Fig . 5C ) . Confirming previous observations , we found that the increase in F - actin was higher during platelet secretion as compared to shape change : F - actin increased from 34±1 % in resting platelets to 56±5 % of total 30sec after addition of thrombin ( Fig . 7A ) . Cofilin association with F - actin increased from 8±2 % in resting platelets to 29±5 % . This increase was a net increase , since the ratio of F - actin - associated cofilin relative to F - actin increased 3 - fold from 0 . 23 in resting platelets to 0 . 64 30sec after addition of thrombin ( Fig . 7C ) . These results suggest that For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 16 the rapid cofilin dephosphorylation ( maximum at 30sec ) generating more active cofilin enhances its association with F - actin and increases F - actin during platelet secretion . Cofilin remained associated with F - actin 60 and 120sec after thrombin stimulation ( Fig . 7B , C ) , indicating that LIMK - 1 - mediated cofilin rephosphorylation did not cause cofilin dissociation from F - actin . Inhibition of Rho - kinase / LIMK - 1 lead to a reduced F - actin increase at 30sec , did not reduce the rapid cofilin dephosphorylation and cofilin association with F - actin during the first 30sec ( Fig . 6A ; Fig . 7A , B ) and reversed the increase of F - actin and the cofilin association with F - actin ( Fig . 6A ; Fig . 7A , B ) . We conclude that Rho - kinase regulates the F - actin increase during platelet secretion through a mechanism other than cofilin phosphorylation and association with F - actin . Discussion Our study identifies LIMK - 1 being activated by Rho - kinase in thrombin - stimulated platelets . Rho - kinase mediated LIMK - 1 phosphorylation during shape change and aggregation / secretion . Although LIMK - 1 was activated , stimulation of cofilin phosphorylation was not observed . Either cofilin phosphorylation was found to be unchanged ( as seen during shape change ) , or cofilin was reversibly dephosphorylated ( as found during aggregation / secretion ) . Both LIMK - 1 activation and changes of cofilin phosphorylation were independent of integrin α IIb ß 3 engagement . Activation of Rho - kinase in activated platelets was measured using a new approach , i . e . by quantifying the phosphorylation of the substrate MYPT on Thr696 38 or Thr853 . 37 Rho kinase activation preceded the increase of F - actin during shape change , and Y - 27632 inhibited the increase of F - actin during shape change , and reduced and reversed the F - actin increase during secretion indicating that Rho - kinase activation mediates the increase of F - actin during shape change , and in part , secretion . We found , that of the two isoforms of LIM - kinase only LIMK - For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 17 1 is expressed in platelets . LIMK - 1 was rapidly phosphorylated during shape change and secretion / aggregation . The kinetics of LIMK - 1 phosphorylation during shape change and secretion were similar to the kinetics of Rho - kinase activation as measured by MYPT phosphorylation suggesting that Rho - kinase phosphorylates LIMK - 1 in intact platelets . Indeed , LIMK - 1 phosphorylation was completely inhibited by two different Rho - kinase inhibitors , Y - 27632 and H - 1152 . Our study is to our knowledge the first to provide evidence that Rho - kinase activates LIMK - 1 during physiological cell activation . Y - 27632 , which does not affect the activity of PAK even at high concentrations ( 100µM ) 35 inhibited completely LIMK - 1 phosphorylation during thrombin - induced platelet shape change , secretion and aggregation , and blocked the increase of LIMK - 1 activity in thrombin - stimulated platelets . Moreover , the novel specific Rho - kinase inhibitor , H - 1152 provided similar results . Other groups using transfected cells have reported that LIMK - 1 can be phosphorylated and activated either by p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) 24 or Rho - kinase . 10 PAK has been shown to be activated during thrombin induced shape change 27 and aggregation , 28 raising the possibility that PAK might phosphorylate LIM - kinase . Our study clearly shows that LIMK - 1 phosphorylation and activation was entirely dependent on Rho - kinase . In agreement with observations made previously , 14 we found that about one third of total cofilin is phosphorylated in resting platelets . We observed a significant decrease of cofilin phosphorylation in resting platelets after incubation with Y - 27632 indicating that the Rho - kinase / LIMK - 1 pathway is needed to maintain this basal level of cofilin phosphorylation . Surprisingly , activation of LIMK - 1 failed to increase cofilin phosphorylation during shape change . The lack of increase of cofilin phosphorylation is explained either by inaccessibility of cofilin for LIMK - 1 in intact platelets and / or by simultaneous activation of a cofilin phosphatase . In support of the latter , we found after inhibiting LIMK - 1 a decrease of cofilin phosphorylation during shape change , indicating that a cofilin phosphatase is activated during For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 18 shape change counteracting the effect of LIMK - 1 on cofilin . Therefore we suggest that phosphocycling of cofilin increases due to simultaneous activation of both LIMK - 1 and a cofilin phosphatase . A similar observation was made previously during neurite extension stimulated with growth factors . 15 A further possibility for the lack of cofilin phosphorylation by LIMK - 1 during shape change is the presence of another LIMK - 1 substrate in platelets . Platelets were stimulated with higher concentrations of thrombin to induce platelet aggregation and secretion subsequent to shape change . In agreement with a previous study showing that Rho and Rho - kinase activation in platelets are upstream of the integrin α IIb β 3 , 26 we found that Rho - kinase activation and subsequent LIMK - 1 activation were independent of integrin α IIb β 3 engagement in thrombin - aggregated platelets . Also cofilin dephosphorylation / rephosphorylation occurred independently , whether platelets aggregated or not indicating that the regulation of cofilin phosphorylation was independent of the integrin α IIb β 3 . The results of rapid cofilin dephosphorylation in thrombin - stimulated platelets are similar to previous and recent findings . 14 , 40 . However , in TRAP - stimulated platelets no decrease of cofilin phosphorylation , only an increase 3 to 5 min after activation was found . 41 In contrast to our results , the study of Falet et al showed that during thrombin - induced platelet aggregation , cofilin remained dephosphorylated suggesting that integrin α IIb β 3 activation leads to cofilin dephosphorylation . Also , a recent study in epithelial cells showed that β 3 overexpression reduced phospho - cofilin levels . 42 A possible explanation for the discrepancies between the study by Falet et al and our study might be the different methods used to isolate washed platelets . We applied a commonly used platelet preparation protocol whereas Falet et al . isolated platelets from plasma using a metrizamide gradient . For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 19 LIMK - 1 phosphorylation during secretion / aggregation was rapid , irreversible and higher than during shape change . In contrast to shape change , cofilin phosphorylation during platelet secretion was rapidly decreased followed by LIMK - 1 mediated rephosphorylation to the level of resting platelets within 2 minutes . The results of inhibition of the Rho - kinase / LIMK - 1 mediated cofilin rephosphorylation with Y - 27632 indicate that this pathway regulates primarily secretion , not aggregation . Y - 27632 did not inhibit cofilin dephosphorylation up to 30 sec . These results suggest , that during platelet secretion the two counteracting pathways regulating cofilin phosphorylation , i . e . cofilin phosphatase and LIMK - 1 sequentially act on cofilin . The rapid and large dephosphorylation of cofilin shows that a cofilin phosphatase is activated very rapidly , and that this enzyme has a better access to its substrate phospho - cofilin than LIMK - 1 ( which is also activated rapidly ) to cofilin . Cofilin might be dephosphorylated by a specific cofilin phosphatase such as the recently identified “slingshot” , which is insensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid . 43 Such an assumption is supported by our results showing that the PP1 / PP2A type phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid did not affect the cofilin dephosphorylation . Since LIMK - 1 is rapidly activated in thrombin - stimulated platelets , but cofilin is rapidly dephosphorylated , one has also to assume a compartmentalisation in order to explain these results . LIMK - 1 is known to bind to a number of different proteins including slingshot , 44 14 - 3 - 3 45 and some transmembrane receptors , 46 so even in its activated form it may not have direct access to cofilin . In summary , we interpret the cofilin phosphorylation data in thrombin - stimulated platelets by rapid activation of a cofilin phosphatase generating active cofilin which is after 30sec rephosphorylated and inactivated by LIMK - 1 . However , we can not exclude that cofilin is phosphorylated in intact platelets by other kinases than LIMK - 1 . We investigated , how cofilin phosphorylation was related to the amount of F - actin , and to the amount of cofilin associated with F - actin . The results with Y - 27632 in resting platelets suggested that LIMK - 1 - mediated cofilin phosphorylation might reduce F - actin content and For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 20 cofilin association with F - actin . However , during shape change there was no relation of the unchanged phospho - cofilin levels with the increase of F - actin ( 11 % ) and cofilin association with F - actin ( 5 % ) . During the initial phase of thrombin induced secretion ( up to 30 sec ) , cofilin dephosphorylation ( Fig . 5C ) was associated a larger increase of F - actin ( 22 % ) and a higher amount of cofilin associated with F - actin ( 21 % ) as compared to shape change ( Fig . 7A , B ) . However , cofilin rephosphorylation after 30 sec did not decrease F - actin , and cofilin association with F - actin . Moreover Y - 27632 pre - treatment reversed the increase of F - actin and cofilin association with F - actin which was associated with an inhibition of cofilin rephosphorylation . We conclude that LIMK - 1 mediated cofilin phosphorylation does not regulate the F - actin increase and cofilin association with F - actin in thrombin - activated platelets . Confirming our results Falet et al 40 showed that only cofilin , but not phospho - cofilin bound to F - actin , that the initial cofilin dephosphorylation was accompanied with an increase in F - actin content and increased association of cofilin with F - actin . However , in contrast to our results , cofilin rephosphorylation 5 to 10 min after thrombin stimulation was paralleled by its dissociation from F - actin . This difference in the study by Falet et al and ours might be due to different lysis methods used for isolation of F - actin . We observed that phalloidin , which was not used in our method but in in the study by Falet et al , displaced cofilin from F - actin and caused F - actin increase during lysis ( data not shown ) . The incubation time for platelet lysis is also critical to avoid changes that occur after platelet lysis . 47 In conclusion , our study indicates that Rho kinase mediates rapidly LIMK - 1 activation and the increase of F - actin during thrombin - induced shape change and aggregation / secretion . The rapid LIMK - 1 activation did , however , not lead to an increased cofilin phosphorylation during shape change and the early phase of secretion . This might be explained by two counteracting pathways regulating cofilin phosphorylation , cofilin phosphatase and LIMK - 1 , and by For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 21 compartmentalisation of LIMK - 1 with reduced accessibility to cofilin in intact platelets .
