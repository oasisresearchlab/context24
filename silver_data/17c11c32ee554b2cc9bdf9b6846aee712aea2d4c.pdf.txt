These cell - matrix contacts contain membrane proteins such as integrins , which bind both matrix components and cellular proteins , thus bridging the substratum and the cytoskeleton ( reviewed in Adams , 2001 ) . Matrix contacts provide the physical linkage that enables cells to adhere to and migrate on ( or through ) the matrix . Moreover , they can also act as localized ‘relay stations’ for important signaling pathways . Well - known cell - matrix contacts include focal complexes and focal adhesions , whereas others , such as ﬁbrillar adhesions , podosomes and invadopodia are just beginning to attract widespread attention . Focal complexes have a dash - like appearance , a length of ~ 0 . 5 µ m and constitute some of the earliest matrix contacts formed by a protruding cell . They are integrin - based and enriched in talin , paxillin and vinculin ( Zamir and Geiger , 2001 ) . Focal complexes can mature into focal adhesions through the application of force – for example , during the retraction of cellular protrusions . This transformation is accompanied by an increase in size , the formation of actin bundles ( stress ﬁbres ) , that contact the structure , and the recruitment of zyxin ( Zaidel - Bar et al . , 2004 ) . Focal adhesions are formed on rigid substrates and contain high levels of phosphotyrosine but low amounts of the actin - binding protein tensin . On soft matrices , however , focal adhesions can give rise to a third type of contact , ﬁbrillar adhesions . In contrast to focal adhesions , ﬁbrillar adhesions display high levels of tensin but contain little phosphotyrosine ( Zamir et al . , 1999 ) . In sum , these matrix contacts not only impart close adhesion to the substratum but also act as mechanosensors , and their ultimate form ( focal adhesion vs ﬁbrillar adhesion ) depends strongly on matrix rigidity ( Zamir and Geiger , 2001 ) .

Structurally , their most distinguishing feature is their two - part architecture : they have a core of F - actin and actin - associated proteins that is surrounded by a ring structure consisting of plaque proteins such as talin or vinculin . This actin - rich core is not present in other cell - matrix contacts . Consequently , actin regulatory pathways exert a major additional inﬂuence on podosome - type contacts . Functionally , the ability of podosomes and invadopodia to engage in matrix degradation clearly sets them apart from other cell - matrix contacts . Podosomes are typically formed in cells of the monocytic lineage , such as macrophages ( Lehto et al . , 1982 ; Linder et al . , 1999 ) , osteoclasts ( Marchisio et al . , 1984 ) or ( immature ) dendritic cells ( Burns et al . , 2001 ) . However , they can also be found or induced in a variety of other cell types , including smooth muscle cells ( Gimona et al . , 2003 ) and endothelial cells ( Moreau et al . , 2003 ; Osiak et al . , 2005 ) . By contrast , invadopodia are found in ﬁbroblasts transformed with viral oncogenes encoding protein tyrosine kinases ( Tarone et al . , 1985 ) and in some malignant cell types ( Buccione et al . , 2004 ) . Indeed , the ﬁrst observation of podosome - type adhesions 25 years ago described such virally induced invadopodia ( David - Pfeuty and Singer , 1980 ) . Podosomes and invadopodia differ in their respective sizes and numbers . Typically , a cell forms dozens of podosomes , but there are only a few invadopodia per cell . However , what invadopodia lack in numbers , they make up for in size : Podosomes have a diameter of 0 . 5 - 1 µ m and a depth of 0 . 2 - 0 . 4 µ m , whereas invadopodia can correspond to an array of membrane invaginations that have a diameter of ~ 8 µ m and also can form root - like extensions into the matrix that are several micrometers deep ( Buccione et al . , 2004 ; McNiven et al . , 2004 ) . Despite these differences , basic similarities between the two structures , both in composition and architecture , are apparent . Indeed , it has been proposed that invadopodia might develop from podosomal precursors ( Linder and Aepfelbacher , 2003 ; Buccione et al . , 2004 ) . It is therefore an attractive speculation that podosomes and invadopodia represent a continuum of specialized matrix contacts comparable to the succession of focal complexes , focal adhesions and ﬁbrillar adhesions described above . The growing list of podosome - containing cells may point to a widespread ability of cells to form this type of actin - rich structure . Furthermore , the fact that podosomes are also formed on soft substrates , such as endothelial monolayers ( Linder and Aepfelbacher , 2003 ) , adds to the notion that podosomes are physiological structures that are also formed in the context of tissues . Functions The main functions of podosomes appear to be adhesion and matrix degradation . Moreover , podosomes have also been implicated in cell migration and invasion . However , much of the evidence for these functions is still circumstantial and needs to be rigorously tested . It is very possible that podosomes have a role in adhesion , because they establish close contact to the substratum , which can be shown by total internal reﬂection ( TIRF ) microscopy , are enriched in adhesion - mediating integrins ( Linder and Aepfelbacher , 2003 ) and form only at the substrate - attached cell side . The aptly named invadopodia were deﬁned through their ability to perform matrix degradation ( Buccione et al . , 2004 ; McNiven et al . , 2004 ) . For podosomes , the case has been less clear cut : podosomes in osteoclasts are enriched in matrix metalloproteases ( Sato et al . , 1997 ; Delaissé et al . , 2000 ) , but it was not shown until recently that , in various cell systems , podosomes overlap regions of matrix degradation ( Burgstaller and Gimona , 2005 ; Osiak et al . , 2005 ) . It is therefore very possible that podosomes , like invadopodia , have an inherent ability to lyse the ECM . Podosomes may also play an accessory role in cell migration . They might help to establish localized anchorage , thus stabilizing sites of cell protrusion and ultimately enabling productive directional movement . The observation that podosomes are recruited to sites of cell protrusion , especially to the leading edge , appears to be in line with such a concept . Podosome - type adhesions are mainly formed in cells that have to cross tissue boundaries such as monocytes , immature dendritic cells or some types of cancer cell ( invadopodia in this case ) . Podosome - localized matrix degradation at the leading edge may therefore also confer invasive potential to cells . Finally , podosomes are a prominent part of the actin cytoskeleton in osteoclasts , where they form continuous belts at the cell periphery ( Pfaff and Jurdic , 1999 ) . Their probable roles in adhesion and matrix degradation suggest an important role in bone homeostasis . Moreover , their fusion was believed to form the bone - remodeling organelle of osteoclasts , the so - called sealing zone , a tightly adherent structure surrounding the space into which lytic enzymes and protons are secreted ( Lakkakorpi and Väänänen , 1996 ) . However , recent data suggest that both types of organelle are formed independently ( Saltel et al . , 2004 ) . Furthermore , on mineralized bone , their physiological substrate , osteoclasts form only sealing zones , but not podosomes ( Saltel et al . , 2004 ) . The proposed role for podosomes – as opposed to sealing zones – in bone homeostasis is therefore again open for debate . Structure and components Podosomes comprise a core of F - actin and actin - associated proteins embedded in a ring structure of integrins and integrin - associated proteins ( see poster , middle and right ) . Ring and core are probably linked by bridging molecules such as α - actinin , and the whole structure is surrounded by a cloud of mostly monomeric actin molecules ( Destaing et al . , 2003 ) . Many podosome components show a distinct localization to either the core or ring structure . Typical core components are F - actin , actin regulators such as members of the Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASP ) family , the Jo u rn a l of Cell S cience 11 8 ( 10 ) J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Arp2 / 3 complex , gelsolin and cortactin , whereas adhesion mediators such as paxillin , vinculin or talin , and kinases such as PI3K or Pyk2 / FAK preferentially associate with the ring structure ( Linder and Aepfelbacher , 2003 ; Buccione et al . , 2004 ) . Podosomes are anchored in the extracellular matrix through integrins . These are distributed over the whole outer surface of the podosome , but show an isotype - speciﬁc localization : β 1 integrins localize mostly to the core , whereas β 2 and β 3 integrins localize to the ring . Regulation Podosomes are inﬂuenced by a variety of cellular signaling pathways . Major modes of podosome regulation include signaling by Rho family GTPases , actin regulatory pathways , protein tyrosine phosphorylation , and the inﬂuence of the microtubule system . Rho GTP as e s The RhoGTPases RhoA , Rac1 and CDC42 have all been shown to regulate podosome turnover in various cell types . Their inﬂuence on podosomes is undisputed ; however , their particular mode of action may depend on the cell type . For example , both dominant active and inactive mutants of these GTPases can interfere with podosome formation or localization in dendritic cells ( Burns et al . , 2001 ) , while expression of dominant active CDC42 leads to podosome formation in aortic endothelial cells ( Moreau et al . , 2003 ) . In any case , podosome turnover appears to need subcellular ﬁne tuning of the GTP / GDP cycles of these cellular master switches ( Linder and Aepfelbacher , 2003 ) . Accordingly , active Rho has been localized to invadopodia in transformed ﬁbroblasts ( Berdeaux et al . , 2004 ) . Actin reg u l a tion The most prominent feature of podosomes is their F - actin - rich core , which is also necessary for the stability of the whole structure ( Lehto et al . , 1982 ) . Members of the WASP family , as well as actin - nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex are both strongly enriched in the podosome core . Absence of these components , either induced artiﬁcially ( Linder et al . , 2000a ) or in disease ( Linder et al . , 1999 ; Burns et al . , 2001 ) ( reviewed in Calle et al . , 2004 ) , results in disruption of podosomes . Another prominent podosome component involved in actin regulation is gelsolin . It probably contributes to actin turnover through its ability to both sever and cap actin ﬁlaments ( Chellaiah et al . , 1998 ) . Tyro s ine pho s phoryl a tion It was noted early on that podosome - type adhesions can be induced by transformation of cells with viruses whose oncogenes encode tyrosine kinases such as v - Src ( Tarone et al . , 1985 ; Marchisio et al . , 1987 ) . Indeed , one of the best ways to visualize podosomes is by staining phosphorylated tyrosine ( Linder and Apfelbacher , 2003 ) , which is highly enriched in some types of adhesive structure . Not surprisingly , cellular tyrosine kinases such as Src and Csk play major roles in podosome regulation ( Howell and Cooper , 1994 ) , and tools for podosome manipulation include Src kinase inhibitors , which disrupt podosomes ( Linder et al . , 2000b ) , and vanadate , a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor , which is able to induce podosome formation ( Marchisio et al . , 1988 ) . Microt ubu le s Microtubules are closely associated with podosomes . Moreover , they have been shown to stabilize podosome patterns such as the marginal belts in osteoclasts ( Babb et al . , 1997 ) , to inﬂuence the fusion and ﬁssion rates of podosome precursors in murine macrophages ( Evans et al . , 2003 ) and to regulate podosome formation in human macrophages ( Linder et al . , 2000b ) . A model for podo s ome form a tion Analysis of podosome - inducing path - ways has been performed in a variety of cell types . From these data we can propose the following simpliﬁed model for podosome formation : The key signal for initiation is attachment of the cell to the substrate , because podosomes are only observed in adherent cells . This leads to clustering and activation of integrins and signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases . One of the most upstream signals is probably PKC activity . This is underscored by the fact that podosome formation can be induced by PKC - activating agents , such as phorbol esters ( Gimona et al . , 2003 ) . An important subsequent switch is activation of Src . Downstream , a variety of pathways are initiated , most notably PI3K signaling ( Chellaiah et al . , 1998 ) , which leads to the formation of the phosphatidylinositols PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , and activation of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) or its haematopoietic relative Pyk2 . 3 (cid:1) phosphoinositide signaling is also inﬂuenced by the RhoGTPases Rho and ( probably ) Rac ( Chellaiah et al . , 2001 ; Sechi and Wehland , 2000 ) . CDC42 , another RhoGTPase , is crucial for the local initiation of actin ﬁlament formation , which gives rise to the formation of the actin - rich core structure . This is achieved by releasing the autoinhibition of N - WASP or its relative WASP , which in turn activates actin - nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex ( Linder et al . , 1999 ; Linder et al . , 2000a ; Burns et al . , 2001 ) . Turnover of core - localized actin ﬁlaments is probably facilitated by gelsolin ( Chellaiah et al . , 1998 ) and the GTPase dynamin ( McNiven et al . , 2004 ; Buccione et al . , 2004 ) . Additionally , dynamin may also play a role in podosome - localized matrix degradation by facilitating matrix metalloprotease release . It is unclear how core - and ring - formation are coordinated . However , similarly to core molecules , central components of the ring structure , such as talin and vinculin , are also inﬂuenced by phosphoinositides ( Sechi and Wehland , 2000 ) , and activation of paxillin through integrin - related signaling ( Pfaff and Jurdic , 2001 ) may constitute one of the earliest signals in ring formation . Dynamics Podosomes are highly dynamic organelles with a half - life of 2 - 12 minutes . Moreover , their inner dynamic is even faster : F - actin in the core turnes over 2 - 3 times during the life span of a podosome ( Destaing et al . , 2003 ) . Individual podosomes are motile within Cell S cience a t a Gl a nce 20 8 1 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 20 8 2 a certain radius , but movement of larger podosome groups is achieved through assembly at the front and disassembly at the rear . This is especially visible in migratory cells where podosomes are recruited to the leading edge . Podosomes can assemble de novo or by branching off precursor clusters , which undergo constant fusion and ﬁssion ( Evans et al . , 2003 ) ( see poster , lower right ) . ‘Regular’ podosomes are mostly found in the inner regions of the cell , while the larger precursor clusters localize to the cell periphery or the leading lamella of migrating cells . Disease Podosomes are assembled from molecules that have multiple functions in the cell , such as actin and Src kinases . Inhibitors of podosome assembly therefore also have profound effects on other parts of the cytoskeleton . Similarly , the absence of podosomes in diseases based on defects in a podosome component ( s ) may only constitute a side effect . The podosome aﬁcionado should therefore take care to ascertain whether a lack of podosomes causes or is simply symptomatic of a particular phenotype . Podosome - associated diseases include Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome ( WAS ) and chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . WAS - patient macrophages ( Linder et al . , 1999 ) and dendritic cells from CML patients ( Dong et al . , 2003 ) both display pronounced defects in podosome formation and chemotaxis .
