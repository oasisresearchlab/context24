To achieve properly controlled migration , motile cells sense environmental chemical signals and transduce them into protrusive activity ( Xu et al . , 2003 ; Van Haastert and Devreotes , 2004 ) . Actin filaments ( F - actins ) polymerize at the leading edge of motile cells and depolymerize proximally ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Le Clainche and Carlier , 2008 ) , which , in conjunction with myosin II activity , induces retrograde flow of F - actins ( Forscher and Smith , 1988 ; Katoh et al . , 1999 ; Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) . Mod - ulation of mechanical coupling between F - actin retrograde flow and cell adhesions by “clutch” molecules is thought to play a key role in the signal - force transduction required for regulatory cell migration ( Mitchison and Kirschner , 1988 ; Suter and Forscher , 2000 ; Le Clainche and Carlier , 2008 ; Toriyama et al . , 2013 ) . An increase in the coupling efficiency produces traction forces on extracellular substrates and concurrently reduces the speed of the F - actin retrograde flow , thereby converting actin polymerization into force that pushes the leading edge membrane . However , the molecular machinery that executes the regulatory coupling remains unknown despite considerable efforts to identify clutch molecules ( Bard et al . , 2008 ; Shimada et al . , 2008 ; Giannone et al . , 2009 ; Lowery and Van Vactor , 2009 ; Thievessen et al . , 2013 ) . Shootin1 is a key molecule involved in neuronal polariza - tion and axon outgrowth ( Toriyama et al . , 2006 , 2010 ; Inagaki et al . , 2011 ; Sapir et al . , 2013 ) . It accumulates at the leading edge of axonal growth cones , and mediates the mechanical coupling between F - actin retrograde flow and the cell adhesion molecule ( CAM ) L1 - CAM ( Kamiguchi et al . , 1998 ) as a clutch molecule ( Shimada et al . , 2008 ) . Pak1 is a downstream kinase of Cdc42 and Rac1 , and is also involved in axon outgrowth and cell mi - gration ( Jacobs et al . , 2007 ; Delorme - Walker et al . , 2011 ) . Re - cently , we reported that the attractive axon guidance molecule netrin - 1 ( Serafini et al . , 1994 ; Li et al . , 2008 ) induces Pak1 - me - diated shootin1 phosphorylation in axonal growth cones ( Tori - yama et al . , 2013 ) . This in turn enhances the coupling between F - actins and shootin1 , thereby promoting the traction forces for axon outgrowth . However , the molecular basis of this regula - tory coupling was not elucidated ( Shimada et al . , 2008 ) . The F - actin binding protein cortactin ( Weed and Parsons , 2001 ) accumulates at sites of dynamic actin assembly , such as the lamellipodia and filopodia of axonal growth cones and mi - grating cells ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ; Weed et al . , 2000 ; Decourt et al . , 2009 ; Kurklinsky et al . , 2011 ) , and the invadopodia of cancer cells ( MacGrath and Koleske , 2012b ) . It induces mem - brane protrusion , lamellipodia persistence , and formation of filopodia and invadopodia ( Kinley et al . , 2003 ; Bryce et al . , Motile cells transduce environmental chemical signals into mechanical forces to achieve properly controlled migration . This signal – force transduction is thought to require regulated mechanical coupling between actin filaments ( F - actins ) , which undergo retrograde flow at the cellular leading edge , and cell adhesions via linker “clutch” molecules . However , the molecular machinery mediating this regulatory coupling remains unclear . Here we show that the F - actin binding molecule cortactin directly interacts with a clutch molecule , shootin1 , in axonal growth cones , thereby mediating the linkage between F - actin retrograde flow and cell adhesions through L1 - CAM . Shootin1 – cortactin interaction was en - hanced by shootin1 phosphorylation by Pak1 , which is activated by the axonal chemoattractant netrin - 1 . We provide evidence that shootin1 – cortactin interaction participates in netrin - 1 – induced F - actin adhesion coupling and in the pro - motion of traction forces for axon outgrowth . Under cell signaling , this regulatory F - actin adhesion coupling in growth cones cooperates with actin polymerization for efficient cellular motility .

We have analyzed the molecular basis of the coupling between F - actin retrograde flow and cell adhesions in axonal growth cones , and show here that cortactin directly mediates the linkage between F - actin retrograde flow and shootin1 as a clutch molecule . Our data further suggest that the shootin1 – cortactin interaction serves as a crucial regulatory interface for signal – force transduction in axon outgrowth . Results Cortactin directly interacts with shootin1 in axonal growth cones To address the missing link between shootin1 and F - actins in the clutch machinery ( Shimada et al . , 2008 ) , we searched for actin - binding proteins that interact with shootin1 using coim - munoprecipitation assays . Among the seven actin binding pro - teins examined ( fascin , VASP , p21 - ARC , Esp8 , XAC2 , capping protein β 1 , and cortactin ) , we detected an interaction between cortactin and shootin1 expressed in COS7 cells ( Fig . 1 A ) . A binding assay using purified shootin1 and FLAG - cortac - tin confirmed their direct interaction in vitro ( Fig . 1 B ) , and , furthermore , cortactin was immunoprecipitated with shootin1 in P6 rat brain lysates ( Fig . 1 C ) . Fig . 1 ( D and E ) shows the subcellular localization of cortactin and shootin1 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons . As previously reported ( Du et al . , 1998 ; Toriyama et al . , 2006 ) , cortactin was localized in growth cones of axons and immature dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons ( Fig . 1 D , arrows and arrowheads ) , whereas shootin1 accumulated preferentially in axonal growth cones ( arrows ) . Cortactin was highly colocalized with shootin1 in the peripheral region of axonal growth cones ( Fig . 1 E , arrowheads ) . Together , these results indicate that cortactin interacts directly with shoo - tin1 in axonal growth cones . Figure 1 . Cortactin directly interacts with shootin1 in axonal growth cones . ( A ) Coimmunoprecipitation of shootin1 and cortactin in COS7 cells . Cells were cotransfected with myc - shootin1 and FLAG - cortactin , and lysates were incubated with anti - FLAG antibody .

As reported previously ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ; MacGrath and Koleske , 2012a ) , purified cortactin is composed of a single major band at 80 kD and an additional upper band ( blue arrowheads ) .

Force generation by shootin1 – cortactin interaction • Kubo et al . 665 Cortactin interacts with F - actin retrograde flow in axonal growth cones Cortactin also colocalized with F - actins in the growth cone pe - ripheral domain ( Fig . 2 A ) , where F - actins undergo directional retrograde flow . Punctate staining of cortactin preferentially co - localized with F - actins in the distal parts of filopodia and lamel - lipodia ( Fig . 2 A , arrowheads ) , as reported previously ( Yamada et al . , 2013 ) . This is consistent with the previous observations that actin molecules are incorporated into F - actins at distal parts ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) and that cortactin binds pref - erentially to newly polymerized ATP / ADP - Pi - F - actin ( Bryce et al . , 2005 ) . To analyze the interaction between cortactin and F - actin retrograde flow at axonal growth cones , we expressed EGFP - cortactin in hippocampal neurons and performed live - cell fluorescence microscopy ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ; Shimada et al . , 2008 ) . EGFP - cortactin displayed fluorescent features that moved retrogradely at the peripheral domain of growth cones ( Fig . 2 B , arrowheads ; and Video 1 ) . To com - pare the movement of the fluorescent features of cortactin directly with that of F - actin retrograde flow , we coexpressed EGFP - cortactin and mCherry - actin in XTC fibroblasts , which are suitable for live - cell fluorescence microscopy of actin in lamellipodia ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) . The signals of EGFP - cortactin and mCherry - actin showed retrograde move - ment at similar speeds ( EGFP - cortactin , 5 . 21 ± 0 . 14 µm / min , n = 30 ; mCherry - actin , 5 . 29 ± 0 . 11 µm / min , n = 30 ; Fig . 2 C and Video 2 ) . To confirm the interaction between cortactin and F - actin retrograde flow , we inhibited actin polymerization with cytochalasin D . Treatment of XTC fibroblasts with 1 µM cyto - chalasin D led to disruption of F - actin flow at the leading edge of lamellipodia , as previously reported ( Shimada et al . , 2008 ) ; this is accompanied by similar redistribution of EGFP - cortactin signals ( Fig . S1 and Video 3 ) . Similar disruption of EGFP - cort - actin signals was induced by cytochalasin D in axonal growth cones ( Fig . 2 D and Video 4 ) , indicating that cortactin interacts with F - actin retrograde flow at axonal growth cones .

JCB • Volume 210 • NumBer 4 • 2015 666 Cortactin functions as a clutch molecule , mediating the linkage between F - actin retrograde flow and L1 - CAM To determine whether cortactin directly mediates the link - age between F - actin and shootin1 , we performed an F - actin cosedimentation assay . As shown in Fig . 3 A , purified cort - actin associated with F - actin as reported ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) , whereas no direct interaction between F - actin and shootin1 was detectable . However , shootin1 cosedimented with F - actin in the presence of cortactin , indicating that cort - actin mediates directly the linkage between F - actin and shoo - tin1 in vitro . To further examine whether cortactin mediates the linkage between F - actins and shootin1 in growth cones , we quantified shootin1 immunoreactivity in neurons cultured on polylysine - coated coverslips ( see Materials and methods ) . Reduction of cortactin expression by RNAi ( Fig . S2 , A and B ) significantly decreased the localization of endogenous shootin1 to axonal growth cones ( Fig . 3 B ) without affect - ing the amount of F - actin ( Fig . S2 C ) , thereby suggesting its dissociation from F - actins . To determine whether cortactin , by linking shoo - tin1 to F - actins , mediates the mechanical coupling be - tween F - actin retrograde flow and L1 - CAM , we performed bead - tracking experiments . Microbeads coated with L1 - CAM - Fc were placed on axonal growth cones using laser optical tweezers . As the L1 - CAM molecules on the bead bind homophilically to L1 - CAM molecules expressed in the growth cone plasma membrane , the bead can monitor the movement of L1 - CAM in the membrane ( Shimada et al . , 2008 ) . On control growth cones , 70 % of the beads showed Figure 3 . Cortactin mediates the linkage be - tween F - actin and shootin1 as a clutch mole - cule . ( A ) Cosedimentation of shootin1 with F - actin in the presence of cortactin . Polymer - ized actin ( 5 µM ) was incubated with purified cortactin ( 1 . 5 µM ; C ) , purified shootin1 - myc ( 1 . 5 µM ; S ) , or both ( C + S ) . After centrifuga - tion , the pellets were immunoblotted with an - ti - cortactin or anti - myc antibody . F - actin was detected by Coomassie brilliant blue ( CBB ) staining . ( B ) Hippocampal neurons were trans - fected with miRNA against cortactin ( # 1 or # 2 ) or control miRNA , and cultured on poly - lysine - coated coverslips for 48 h . They were then fixed and immunostained with anti - shoo - tin1 antibody . The vectors for the miRNAs are designed to coexpress EGFP . Arrowheads indi - cate an axonal growth cone .

See Videos 5 and 6 . The bottom panel illustrates the percentage of beads that showed retrograde flow on growth cones expressing control miRNA ( n = 38 ) or cortactin miRNA ( n = 38 ; left ) , the mean velocity of moving beads ( middle ) , and the percentage of moving beads with the indicated velocities ( right ) .

Force generation by shootin1 – cortactin interaction • Kubo et al . 667 retrograde movement ( Fig . 3 C and Video 5 ) at a velocity of 0 . 93 ± 0 . 07 µm / min ( mean ± SE , n = 38 ) , as reported previously ( Shimada et al . , 2008 ) . However , suppression of cortactin by RNAi significantly reduced the flow velocity of the beads ( 0 . 48 ± 0 . 05 µm / min , n = 38 ; Fig . 3 C and Video 6 ) , indicating a reduction of the linkage between F - actin retrograde flow and L1 - CAM . We conclude from these experiments that cortactin functions as a clutch mole - cule mediating the linkage between F - actin retrograde flow and L1 - CAM in growth cones . Cortactin is involved in shootin1 - mediated and L1 - CAM – dependent axon outgrowth We next investigated the role of cortactin in axon outgrowth . Con - sistent with a previous study ( Toriyama et al . , 2006 ) , overexpres - sion of shootin1 in hippocampal neurons cultured on coverslips coated with L1 - CAM - Fc promoted formation of multiple axons ( Fig . 4 A ) . However , this shootin1 - mediated axon formation was inhibited by reducing the level of cortactin by RNAi , and this inhibition was rescued by expression of an RNAi - refractory cort - actin ( Fig . 4 A ) . As reported previously ( Shimada et al . , 2008 ) , Figure 4 . Cortactin is involved in shootin1 - mediated and L1 - CAM – dependent axon outgrowth . ( A ) Hippocampal neurons overexpressing myc - GST ( con - trol ) or myc - shootin1 were cultured on coverslips coated with L1 - CAM - Fc for 6 d and then immunostained with anti - myc and tau - 1 antibodies . The neurons were also cotransfected with a vector to express a control miRNA or cortactin miRNA ( # 1 or # 2 ) , which also coexpresses EGFP . RNAi - refractory cortactin was also coexpressed in the indicated experiments .

JCB • Volume 210 • NumBer 4 • 2015 668 hippocampal neurons cultured on L1 - CAM - Fc developed longer axons than those on a control substrate , polylysine ( Fig . 4 B ) . Suppression of cortactin expression by RNAi resulted in a signif - icant decrease in axonal length on L1 - CAM - Fc but not on poly - lysine ( Fig . 4 B ) . In addition , expression of an RNAi - refractory cortactin rescued the effect of cortactin RNAi . Our previous work also showed that shootin1 knockdown selectively inhibits axonal outgrowth on L1 - CAM – coated substrates ( Shimada et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , consistent with the idea that cortactin constitutes a clutch system involving shootin1 and L1 - CAM , shootin1 - mediated and L1 - CAM – dependent axon outgrowth is also cortactin - dependent . The shootin1 – cortactin interaction is enhanced by Pak1 - mediated shootin1 phosphorylation Netrin - 1 induces Pak1 - mediated shootin1 phosphorylation at Ser101 and Ser249 , thereby enhancing the interaction between F - actin and shootin1 ( Toriyama et al . , 2013 ) . To determine whether the shootin1 – cortactin interaction functions as a key interface for the netrin - induced F - actin adhesion coupling , we analyzed the interaction between the phosphorylated shootin1 and cortactin . An in vitro binding assay detected the interaction of cortactin with phosphomimic shootin1 ( shootin1 - DD ) , in which Ser101 and Ser249 were replaced by aspartate ( Figs . 5 A and S3 A ) . Importantly , the interaction of cortactin with shootin1 - DD was stronger than that with shootin1 wild type ( shootin1 - WT ) . This corresponded to a 2 . 2 - fold decrease ( P < 0 . 05 , n = 4 ) in the apparent dissociation constant for shoo - tin1 - DD ( K d = 11 . 5 ± 1 . 2 nM ) compared with shootin1 - WT ( K d = 25 . 0 ± 4 . 9 nM ; Fig . 5 B ) . Consistently , shootin1 phosphor - ylated by Pak1 showed a stronger interaction with cortactin than did unphosphorylated shootin1 ( Fig . 5 C ) . Coimmuno - precipitation assays detected cortactin – shootin1 – DD and cort - actin – shootin1 – WT interactions in COS7 cells ( Fig . S3 B ) . Figure 5 . Pak1 - mediated shootin1 phosphorylation enhances shootin1 – cortactin interaction . ( A and B ) In vitro binding assay using purified shootin1 and purified FLAG - cortactin . Shootin1 - DD or shootin1 - WT at increasing concentrations were incubated with FLAG - cortactin and anti - FLAG antibody . The immu - noprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti - shootin1 or anti - FLAG antibody ( A ) , and the bound shootin1 - DD and - WT were then quantified ( B ) . Data rep - resent means ± SEM ( error bars ; n = 4 ) . ( C ) In vitro binding assay using purified Pak1 - phosphorylated shootin1 and purified FLAG - cortactin . Shootin1 - WT ( 80 nM ) or Pak1 - phosphorylated shootin1 - WT ( 80 nM ) were incubated with FLAG - cortactin ( 80 nM ) and anti - FLAG antibody . The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti - shootin1 , anti - pSer249 - shootin1 , anti – pSer101 - shootin1 , or anti - FLAG antibody . ( D ) Coimmunoprecipitation of shootin1 and cortactin in COS7 cells . Cells were transfected with vectors to express FLAG - shootin1 and myc - cortactin ; some of them were also cotransfected with a vector to express dominant - negative Pak1 ( KD ) or constitutively active Pak1 ( CA ) as indicated . Cell lysates were then incubated with anti - FLAG antibody . The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti - myc , anti - FLAG , anti - pSer249 - shootin1 , or anti – pSer101 - shootin1 antibody .

Force generation by shootin1 – cortactin interaction • Kubo et al . 669 However , we could not detect an interaction between cortactin and unphosphorylated shootin1 ( shootin1 - AA ) where Ser101 and Ser249 were replaced by alanine . Consistent with this , ectopic expression of a constitutively active PAK1 increased phosphorylation of FLAG - shootin1 at Ser101 and Ser249 in COS cells ; this in turn promoted the shootin1 – cortactin inter - action ( Fig . 5 D ) . Conversely , expression of a dominant - neg - ative PAK1 decreased shootin1 phosphorylation and inhibited the interaction ( Fig . 5 D ) . In axonal growth cones , phosphory - lated shootin1 was highly colocalized with cortactin ( Fig . 5 E ) , strengthening our conclusion that shootin1 phosphorylation by Pak1 promotes the shootin1 – cortactin interaction . Cortactin mediates netrin - 1 – induced F - actin - substrate coupling and the promotion of traction force for axon outgrowth We further examined the role of cortactin in netrin - 1 – induced F - actin – substrate coupling by monitoring the F - actin flow in growth cones . Hippocampal neurons expressing mRFP - actin were cultured on coverslips coated with L1 - CAM - Fc , and F - actin flow in the growth cone was monitored by live - cell flu - orescence microscopy ( Fig . 6 A ) . Coupling between F - actins and substrate reduces the speed of F - actin flow ( Suter et al . , 1998 ; Le Clainche and Carlier , 2008 ; Toriyama et al . , 2013 ) . In control growth cones , the fluorescent features of mRFP - ac - tin moved retrogradely at 3 . 4 ± 0 . 1 µm / min ( mean ± SE , n = 40 ) , as previously reported ( Toriyama et al . , 2013 ) . Consistent with the role of cortactin as a clutch molecule , a reduction of cortactin expression by RNAi increased the velocity of F - actin flow ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) , reflecting increased slippage of F - ac - tin – substrate coupling ( Le Clainche and Carlier , 2008 ; Lowery and Van Vactor , 2009 ) . However , netrin - 1 stimulation signifi - cantly decreased the velocity of F - actin flow , but increased it when cortactin expression was reduced ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) , suggesting that netrin - 1 – mediated F - actin – substrate coupling is also cortactin dependent . To determine whether cortactin is involved in generat - ing traction force for axon outgrowth , we performed traction force microscopy . Hippocampal neurons were cultured on L1 - CAM - Fc – coated polyacrylamide gels embedded with 200 - nm fluorescent beads . Traction forces under the growth cones were monitored by visualizing force - induced deforma - tion of the elastic substrate , which is reflected by displace - ment of the beads from their original positions . As reported previously ( Chan and Odde , 2008 ; Toriyama et al . , 2013 ) , the reporter beads under the growth cones moved dynamically toward the center in a “load - and - fail” manner ( Fig . 6 C and Video 7 ) and the net force was oriented toward the rear of the growth cones ( Fig . 6 D ) . The magnitude of the traction force increased markedly after netrin - 1 treatment , which is consistent with our observation that netrin - 1 promotes clutch engagement ( Toriyama et al . , 2013 ) . Suppressing cortactin expression by RNAi decreased both the basal level of trac - tion forces and netrin - 1 – mediated promotion of traction forces at growth cones ( Fig . 6 D ) . Consistently , cortactin RNAi also decreased axon length and inhibited netrin - 1 – in - duced axon outgrowth ( Fig . 6 E ) . In addition , reexpression of an RNAi - refractory cortactin rescued the effects of cort - actin RNAi ( Fig . 6 , D and E ) . The present data for cort - actin knockdown are similar to those obtained previously by shootin1 RNAi ( Toriyama et al . , 2013 ) , and suggest that cortactin is involved in netrin - 1 – induced generation of trac - tion force for axon outgrowth . The shootin1 – cortactin interaction mediates netrin - 1 – induced generation of traction force and axon outgrowth Finally , we asked whether the interaction between shootin1 and cortactin is involved in netrin - 1 – induced generation of traction force and axon outgrowth . To address this , we analyzed the shootin1 region that interacts with cortactin , and the cortactin domain that binds to shootin1 - DD , using deletion mutants . An in vitro binding assay showed that residues 261 – 377 of shoo - tin1 ( shootin1 ( 261 – 377 ) ) were essential and sufficient to bind to cortactin ( Fig . 7 A ) , whereas the cortactin repeats region ( residues 80 – 287 ) interacted with shootin1 - DD ( Fig . S4 A ) . To examine whether shootin1 ( 261 – 377 ) disturbs the interaction between full - length shootin1 and cortactin , we overexpressed shootin1 ( 261 – 377 ) in XTC fibroblasts . We fused the nuclear export signal ( NES ) LSLKLAGLDL ( Fukuda et al . , 1996 ) to shootin1 ( 261 – 377 ) , as shootin1 ( 261 – 377 ) unexpectedly ac - cumulated in the neuronal nucleus ( unpublished data ) . Overex - pression of a control protein myc - GST in hippocampal neurons did not decrease the number of EGFP - shootin1 signals that dis - played retrograde movement ( Fig . S4 B and Video 8 ) . However , overexpression of myc - NES - shootin1 ( 261 – 377 ) substantially decreased the number of EGFP - shootin1 signals that displayed retrograde movement , without affecting the retrograde flow of mRFP - actin signals ( Fig . S4 B and Video 9 ) , thereby suggest - ing that myc - NES - shootin1 ( 261 – 377 ) disturbs the interaction between shootin1 and cortactin . When expressed in hippocam - pal neurons , Myc - NES - shootin1 ( 261 – 377 ) was highly colocal - ized with cortactin in axonal growth cones ( Fig . S4 C ) . As in the case of cortactin RNAi , overexpression of myc - NES - shootin1 ( 261 – 377 ) in hippocampal neurons led to a decrease in both the basal level of traction forces and netrin - 1 – induced generation of traction forces at growth cones ( Fig . 7 B ) . Overexpression of myc - NES - shootin1 ( 261 – 377 ) also decreased axon length and inhibited netrin - 1 – induced axon outgrowth ( Fig . 7 C ) . To - gether , these data suggest that the shootin1 – cortactin interac - tion mediates netrin - 1 – induced generation of traction force and concomitant axon outgrowth . Discussion Molecular machinery to regulate F - actin – adhesion coupling Coupling between F - actin retrograde flow and adhesion by clutch machinery has long been implicated in the regula - tion of cellular protrusion and migration . The present study reveals that the shootin1 – cortactin complex serves as a core regulatory component of the clutch machinery in the axonal growth cone . Here , Pak1 - mediated shootin1 phosphorylation enhances the shootin1 – cortactin interaction , thereby execut - ing signal – force transduction in axon outgrowth ( Fig . 7 D ) . The identified clutch machinery uses L1 - CAM as a CAM , and the shootin1 – L1 - CAM interaction is the missing link at present : whether shootin1 interacts directly with L1 - CAM as well as whether this interaction is regulated by signaling are unclear . Previous studies reported that Pak1 and other protein kinases phosphorylate cortactin ( Vidal et al . , 2002 ; Grassart et al . , 2010 ; MacGrath and Koleske , 2012b ) , raising JCB • Volume 210 • NumBer 4 • 2015 670 Figure 6 .

( D ) Statistical analyses ( right ) of the magnitude and angle ( θ ) of the traction Force generation by shootin1 – cortactin interaction • Kubo et al . 671 the possibility that cortactin phosphorylation may regulate the shootin1 – cortactin interaction . In addition , modification of the interaction between F - actin and cortactin ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ; MacGrath and Koleske , 2012a ) would also influ - ence F - actin adhesion coupling . In nonneuronal cells , the integrin - based focal adhesion ( FA ) is thought to play a key role in F - actin – substrate coupling at the cellular front , and candidate clutch components such as vinculin and talin have been identified ( Le Clainche and Carlier , 2008 ; Zhang et al . , 2008 ; Thievessen et al . , 2013 ) . However , the FA is a complex structure composed of a large number of different proteins , and the molecular machinery that regulates F - actin – FA coupling is unclear . Cortactin is expressed in non - neuronal cells ( Weed and Parsons , 2001 ; MacGrath and Koleske , 2012b ) , and although shootin1 analyzed here is a brain - specific protein ( Toriyama et al . , 2006 ) , we have found that an alter - native splicing variant of shootin1 is expressed in peripheral tissues ( unpublished data ) . A shootin – cortactin interaction in nonneuronal cells is an intriguing issue for future analyses . Cortactin as a clutch molecule Cortactin interacts with a large number of signaling , cytoskel - etal , and membrane trafficking proteins , and multiple mecha - nisms for cortactin - mediated cell motility have been proposed ( Kirkbride et al . , 2011 ; MacGrath and Koleske , 2012b ) . Cort - actin binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Weed et al . , 2000 ) , which is essential for F - actin nucleation ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) , and serves as a cofactor for its activation ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . Cortactin stabilizes Arp2 / 3 - mediated F - ac - tin branches ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) , and is also reported to play a role in endocytic processes ( Cao et al . , 2003 ; Sauvonnet et al . , 2005 ) and secretion of extracellular matrix ( Sung et al . , 2011 ) . forces under axonal growth cones expressing control miRNA or miRNA against cortactin before or after netrin - 1 stimulation .

Netrin - 1 induces Pak1 - mediated shootin1 phosphorylation , which in turn promotes the interaction between shootin1 and cortactin . The shootin1 – cortactin interaction couples F - actin retrograde flow with cell adhesion , thereby transmitting the force of F - actin retrograde flow ( black arrow ) onto the extracellular substrate ( blue arrow ) . This also reduces the speed of the F - actin flow , thereby converting actin polymerization into force that pushes the leading edge membrane ( red arrow ) . F - actin adhesion coupling and actin polymerization , under the activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 , cooperate complementarily for efficient promotion of protrusive forces .

JCB • Volume 210 • NumBer 4 • 2015 672 Our data present a previously unknown mechanism for cortactin - mediated cell motility . Reduction of endogenous cort - actin did not significantly decrease the F - actin content in the growth cones ( Fig . S2 C ) , suggesting that cortactin - mediated F - actin nucleation and stabilization through Arp2 / 3 complex do not have a dominant effect . This is further supported by the find - ing that cortactin RNAi led to an increase in the rate of F - actin flow in growth cones ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . If cortactin contributed to axon outgrowth by activating actin polymerization through Arp2 / 3 complex , cortactin RNAi should lead to a decrease in the F - actin flow rate ; however , the inverse effect was observed . We therefore conclude that cortactin promotes traction force and L1 - CAM – dependent axon outgrowth mainly by coupling F - actins with cell adhesions . A recent study reported that cortactin can bind and stabi - lize F - actins ( Courtemanche et al . , 2015 ) ; it also forms a ring complex together with dynamin 1 that mechanically stabilizes F - actin bundles in growth cone filopodia ( Yamada et al . , 2013 ) . The cortactin - dependent force generation may cooperate with the F - actin stabilizing activity of cortactin in the formation of growth cone filopodia and axon outgrowth . In addition , the present mechanism may explain the observation of Decourt et al . ( 2009 ) that cortactin accumulates at IgCAM adhesion sites together with F - actins in Aplysia californica growth cones . Interestingly , another recent study showed that inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex , which interacts with cortactin , led to delocal - ization of Arp2 / 3 complex from the leading edge of A . califor - nica growth cones and an increase in F - actin flow rate ( Yang et al . , 2012 ) . The effect on the F - actin flow rate appears dif - ficult to explain in terms of the Arp2 / 3 complex activity that nucleates F - actins to generate actin networks ; thus , it would be interesting to examine whether inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex also leads to a delocalization of cortactin from the leading edge , which may inhibit F - actin adhesion coupling and subsequently increase the F - actin flow rate . Cooperation between F - actin adhesion coupling and actin polymerization in protrusive activity Stimulation of actin polymerization also plays a key role in cel - lular motility ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Lowery and Van Vac - tor , 2009 ) . The regulatory clutch machinery identified here , in conjunction with actin polymerization , provides an integrated view of how forces for cellular motility are generated under cell signaling . As shown here , an increase in the coupling ef - ficiency produces traction force on the extracellular substrate ( Fig . 7 D , blue arrow ) . This also reduces the speed of F - actin retrograde flow , thereby converting actin polymerization into force that pushes the leading edge membrane ( Fig . 7 D , red arrow ) . However , promotion of actin polymerization at the lead - ing edge not only produces force to push the front ( Fig . 7 D , red arrow ) but also increases the F - actin flow rate by counter - acting force ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) ; this in turn increases the traction force on the extracellular sub - strate ( Fig . 7 D , blue arrow ) . In this regard , F - actin adhesion coupling and actin polymerization play complementary roles in triggering protrusive forces . Activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 promotes not only Pak1 - mediated shootin1 phosphorylation but also actin polym - erization ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Miki et al . , 2000 ; Peng et al . , 2003 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Le Clainche and Carlier , 2008 ; Fig . 7 D ) . Stimulation of axonal growth cones with netrin - 1 , which activates Cdc42 and Rac1 ( Shekarabi et al . , 2005 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Toriyama et al . , 2013 ) , led to an increase in the F - ac - tin flow rate when promotion of F - actin adhesion coupling was inhibited by cortactin RNAi ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . We believe that this effect reflects increased actin polymerization ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) induced by the activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 . In this case , in contrast to the control exper - iment , netrin - 1 stimulation did not promote formation of trac - tion force or axon outgrowth ( Fig . 6 , D and E ) . Similar results were obtained when F - actin adhesion coupling was blocked by shootin1 RNAi ( Toriyama et al . , 2013 ) . Together , these data underscore the role of F - actin adhesion coupling in linking in - creased actin polymerization to forces for protrusive activity . In conclusion , the present study identifies a molecular complex that regulates F - actin adhesion coupling , and thus paves the way for acquiring molecular - level and structural insights underlying it . Intracellular asymmetric activation of F - actin adhesion coupling would contribute to directional axon formation and guidance ( Li et al . , 2008 ; Mai et al . , 2009 ) . The system involving polymerizing F - actins , the molecular clutch , and adhesion molecules ( Fig . 7 D ) would integrate not only dif - fusible chemical signals but also adhesive and mechanical cues ( Esch et al . , 1999 ; Chan and Odde , 2008 ) to regulate protrusive activity . A comprehensive elucidation of this system will lead to a profound understanding of cell migration , development , and various pathological processes . Materials and methods Cultures and transfection Hippocampal neurons prepared from embryonic day 18 rat embryos were cultured on coverslips coated with L1 - CAM - Fc or polylysine as described previously ( Shimada et al . , 2008 ) . For preparation of L1 - CAM - Fc , COS - 7 cells were transfected with pCAGGS - L1 - CAM - Fc vector using the calcium phosphate method . The culture media were conditioned for 48 h , and the L1 - CAM - Fc were purified from the cul - ture supernatant by a recombinant protein A – Sepharose column ( GE Healthcare ) . All experiments except for the measurement of forces were performed on L1 - CAM – coated or polylysine - coated glass sur - faces . The neurons were transfected with vectors using Nucleofector ( Lonza ) before plating . We previously reported that shootin1 accumu - lation at the growth cone is influenced by the length of neurite ( Tori - yama et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , to examine the effects of cortactin RNAi on shootin1 localization in axonal growth cones ( Fig . 3 B ) , we cul - tured neurons on polylysine - coated coverslips because suppression of cortactin expression by RNAi did not result in a decrease in axonal length on polylysine ( Fig . 4 B ) . XTC cells were cultured as described previously ( Higashida et al . , 2004 ) and transfected with vectors using FuGENE 6 ( Roche ) . COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modi - fied Eagle’s medium ( Sigma - Aldrich ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Japan Bio Serum ) and transfected with vectors by the calcium phosphate method . DNA constructs Rat cortactin cDNA was amplified by PCR from a rat brain cDNA library ( Takara Bio Inc . ) with the primers 5 ′ - CTGGATCCATGT - GGAAAGCTTCTGCAGGC - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - CTGGATCCCTACTG - CCGCAGCTCCACATAG - 3 ′ . cDNA fragments of cortactin and shootin1 deletion mutants were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX - 6P - 1 ( fused to N - terminal GST - tag , tac promoter ; GE Health - care ) , pCAGGS - myc ( fused to N - terminal myc - tag , β - actin promoter ; Force generation by shootin1 – cortactin interaction • Kubo et al . 673 Niwa et al . , 1991 ) , pCMV - myc ( fused to N - terminal myc - tag , cytomeg - alovirus [ CMV ] promoter ; Agilent Technologies ) , or pEGFP - C1 ( fused to N - terminal EGFP - tag , CMV promoter ; Takara Bio Inc . ) vector . The generation of unphosphorylated ( S101A / S249A : AA ) and phosphomi - metic ( S101D / S249D : DD ) mutants of shootin1 has been described pre - viously ( Toriyama et al . , 2013 ) . pCAGGS - myc was used to overexpress proteins under the β - actin promoter as described previously ( Toriyama et al . , 2006 ) . Unexpectedly , myc - shootin1 ( 261 – 377 ) preferentially ac - cumulated in the neuronal nucleus , whereas it was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of XTC cells . To express myc - shootin1 ( 261 – 377 ) in the cytoplasm of neurons , we fused the NES LSLKLAGLDL ( Fukuda et al . , 1996 ) to the N terminus of myc - shootin1 ( 261 – 377 ) . RNAi For RNAi experiments , we used a Block - iT Pol II miR RNAi expres - sion kit ( Invitrogen ) . The targeting miRNA sequences of cortactin miRNA # 1 ( 5 ′ - GCAGCACAGCATGTCCTTGTA - 3 ′ ) and cortactin miRNA # 2 ( 5 ′ - TACATCGCGTCTGCGTGTGTT - 3 ′ ) correspond to nucleotides 2708 – 2728 and nucleotides 1719 – 1739 in the 3 ′ UTR re - gion of rat cortactin mRNA , respectively . The control vector pcDNA 6 . 2 - GW / EmGFP - miR - neg encodes an miRNA ( 5 ′ - GAAATGTACT - GCGCGTGGAGACGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACGTCTCCACG - CAGTACATTT - 3 ′ ) that targets no known vertebrate gene . To ensure a high level of expression of cortactin miRNA before axon outgrowth , neurons transfected with miRNA were cultured in suspension on non - coated polystyrene dishes for 24 h ( Toriyama et al . , 2006 ) , and then collected and seeded onto coated - glass coverslips , polyacrylamide gels , or glass - bottom dishes . Reduction of cortactin levels in neurons was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry , using anti - cortactin antibody ( Fig . S2 , A and B ) . As cortactin miRNA # 1 and cortactin miRNA # 2 target 3 ′ UTR regions of cortactin mRNA , cort - actin exogenously expressed by the pCMV - myc vector functioned as an RNAi - refractory cortactin . Protein preparation and in vitro kinase assay Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins and purified on Glutathione Sepharose columns ( GE Healthcare ) , after which GST was removed from them by PreScission protease ( GE Healthcare ) . L1 - CAM - Fc was prepared as described previously ( Shimada et al . , 2008 ) . Kinase reactions were performed in 20 µl kinase buffer ( 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM MnCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , and 125 µM ATP , in the presence or absence of 10 µCi γ - [ 32 P ] ATP ) containing 250 ng active GST - Pak1 ( Invitrogen ) and 2 . 1 µg purified shootin1 . In vitro binding assay and F - actin sedimentation assay Purified FLAG - cortactin and shootin1 were incubated overnight at 4°C in reaction buffer ( 0 . 3 % CHAPS , 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA , and 1 mM DTT ) and centrifuged for 15 min at 17 , 400 g at 4°C . The supernatants were incubated with 15 µl ( bed volume ) of an - ti - FLAG M2 gel ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 2 h at 4°C . Anti - FLAG M2 gels were washed three times with wash buffer ( reaction buffer + 150 mM NaCl ) and once with TED buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA , and 1 mM DTT ) . For elution , the gels were incubated with 25 µl of FLAG peptide ( 400 µg / ml ; Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 h at 4°C . The supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting . Apparent dissociation constants were calculated by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism 6 ( GraphPad Software ) . Human nonmuscle actin was obtained from Cytoskeleton , Inc . F - actin sedimentation assays were performed according to the manu - facturer’s protocol with slight modifications . We used actin stored in general actin buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 ) supple - mented with 0 . 2 mM ATP . Actin was polymerized in polymerization buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM ATP ) , and polymerized actin was centrifuged for 1 h at 100 , 000 g at 4°C . After removal of the supernatant , the pellet was resuspended in buffer A ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 0 . 5 mM ATP ) . To perform the F - actin sedimentation assay , 1 . 5 µM of purified protein was incubated with 7 . 5 µg of polymerized actin for 1 h at room temperature . 25 µl of the mixture was overlaid on 50 µl of buffer A containing 10 % sucrose , and centrifuged for 1 h at 100 , 000 g at 4°C . The pellet fractions were washed three times with buffer A and analyzed by immunoblotting . Immunocytochemistry , microscopy , immunoprecipitation , and immunoblotting Cultured neurons were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in Krebs buffer for 10 min at room temperature , followed by treatment for 15 min with 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 in PBS on ice and 10 % fetal bovine serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature . They were then stained with antibodies ( mouse anti - cortactin , mouse anti - Tau1 , rabbit anti - shootin1 , and rab - bit anti - myc antibodies ) and Alexa Fluor 350 phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) , as described previously ( Shimada et al . , 2008 ) . Secondary antibodies and phalloidin were conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 ( Invitrogen ) or Alexa Fluor 594 ( Invitrogen ) . We used 50 % glycerol and 50 % PBS as the mounting medium . Fluorescence and phase - contrast images of neu - rons were acquired using a fluorescence microscope ( Axioplan2 ; Carl Zeiss ) equipped with a plan - Neofluar 20× 0 . 50 NA or 63× oil 1 . 40 NA objective lens ( Carl Zeiss ) , a charge - coupled device camera ( AxioCam MRm ; Carl Zeiss ) , and imaging software ( Axiovision3 ; Carl Zeiss ) . Axon length and the relative fluorescence intensity of shootin1 or F - ac - tin were measured using Multi Gauge software ( Fujifilm ) . Immunopre - cipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously ( Shimada et al . , 2008 ) . For immunoprecipitation , supernatants of brain lysates or cell lysates were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4°C , and immunocomplexes were then precipitated with protein G – Sephar - ose 4B ( GE Healthcare ) . After washing out beads with RIPA buffer , immunocomplexes were analyzed by immunoblotting . Bead tracking , live - cell fluorescence microscopy , and traction force microscopy Bead tracking and live - cell fluorescence microscopy were performed as described previously ( Shimada et al . , 2008 ) . In brief , 1 - µm - diameter polystyrene beads ( Polysciences , Inc . ) were coated with L1 - CAM - Fc . We used the laser optical trap system to place beads on growth cones cultured in Leibovitz’s L - 15 medium ( Invitrogen ) . Differential inter - ference contrast ( DIC ) images of beads were acquired at room tem - perature using a fluorescence microscope ( Eclipse TE2000 - U ; Nikon ) equipped with a plan - Apochromat 60× water immersion 1 . 20 NA ob - jective lens ( Nikon ) and a digital video camera ( DCR - SR100 ; Sony ) . Bead velocity was quantified using Multi Gauge software . The live - cell fluorescence imaging data in Fig . 6 A were obtained using neurons cultured on coverslips coated with L1 - CAM - Fc , whereas the other data for live - cell imaging were obtained with neurons or XTC cells cultured on polylysine - coated coverslips . Traction force microscopy was performed as described pre - viously ( Toriyama et al . , 2013 ) . In brief , neurons were cultured on L1 - CAM - Fc – coated polyacrylamide gels embedded with fluorescent microspheres ( 200 nm diameter ; Invitrogen ) . Time - lapse imaging of fluorescent beads and growth cones was performed at 37°C using a confocal microscope ( LSM710 ; Carl Zeiss ) equipped with a C - Apo - chromat 63× / 1 . 2 W Corr objective lens . The growth cone area was determined from EGFP fluorescence or DIC images . Traction forces under the growth cones were monitored by visualizing force - induced JCB • Volume 210 • NumBer 4 • 2015 674 deformation of the elastic substrate , which is reflected by displace - ment of the beads from their original positions , and expressed as vec - tors ( Toriyama et al . , 2013 ) . The force vectors detected by the beads under individual growth cones were then averaged , and were expressed as vectors composed of magnitude and angle ( θ ; Fig . 6 D , left ) . To compare the forces under different conditions , the force vectors of in - dividual growth cones under each condition were then averaged , and the magnitude and angle of the averaged force vector were obtained ( Fig . 6 D , right two panels ) . Statistical analysis Significance was determined by the unpaired Student’s t test in most cases . For multiple comparisons , we used one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with Schaffer’s post hoc test . Materials Preparations of anti - shootin1 , anti - pSer101 - shootin1 , and anti - pS - er249 - shootin1 antibodies have been described elsewhere ( Toriyama et al . , 2006 , 2013 ) . Antibodies against cortactin ( 4F11 ) and actin were obtained from EMD Millipore . Antibodies against Tau - 1 , myc , and FLAG were obtained from EMD Millipore , MBL , and Sigma - Al - drich , respectively . Cytochalasin D and polylysine were obtained from EMD Millipore and Sigma - Aldrich , respectively .
