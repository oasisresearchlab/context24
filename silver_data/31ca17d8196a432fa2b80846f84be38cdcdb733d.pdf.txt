Inthepresentstudy , we demonstrated that stabilizing actin ﬁ laments by inhibiting gene expression of the two main actin depolymerizing factors ( ADFs ) : Co ﬁ lin 1 ( CFL1 ) and Destrin ( DSTN ) in hMSCs , enhanced cellviability and differ - entiation into osteoblastic cells ( OB ) in vitro , as well as heterotopic bone formation in vivo .

Introduction Cytoskeleton is a cellular scaffolding contained within cytoplasm . It maintains the cell shape , provides mechanical strength , directs locomo - tion , regulates chromosome separation in mitosis and meiosis and intra - cellular transport of organelles in cells ( Doherty and McMahon , 2008 ; Van Troys et al . , 2008 ) . Actin micro ﬁ laments are the major structure of the cytoskeleton . The actin protein exists within cells in either globular / monomer ( G - actin ) or ﬁ lamentous ( F - actin ) forms and thus in highly dynamic transitions of depolymerization and polymerizationin . During depolymerization , polymerized actin ( F - actin ) is severed / depolymerized and turns to monomer actin ( G - actin ) . G - actin can be recycled , trans - ferredbackinto ﬁ lamentformbyanADP - to - ATPexchange . ATP - actinbe - comes available for assembly and polymerization to F - actin ( Ono , 2007 ) . The process of assembly and disassembly of actin ﬁ laments in cells is regulated by actin depolymerizing factors ( ADFs ) that in mammals include : Co ﬁ lin1 ( CFL1 , non - muscle Co ﬁ lin ) , Co ﬁ lin2 ( CFL2 , muscle Co ﬁ lin ) , andDestrin ( DSTN , alsocalledADForCorn1 ) . CFL1isubiquitous - ly expressed , while CFL2 is only expressed in muscles . DSTN also exhibits ubiquitous expression , and its levels are about 5 % to 10 % of CFL1 levels ( Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ) . Co ﬁ lin binds to actin monomers and ﬁ laments , causing depolymerization of actin ﬁ laments preventing their reassembly ( Ghosh et al . , 2004 ) . Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulate Co ﬁ lin ’ s binding and associating activity with actin ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Maekawa et al . , 1999 ) . DSTN is a component protein in micro ﬁ laments . It severs actin ﬁ laments ( F - actin ) and binds to G - actin , thereby , sequestering actin monomers and preventing polymerization ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ) . During lineage speci ﬁ c differentiation , human stromal ( skeletal ) stem cells ( hMSCs ) exhibit signi ﬁ cant changes in morphology and actin cytoskeletal organization ( McBeath et al . , 2004 ; Yourek et al . , 2007 ; Treiser et al . , 2010 ) . For example , during adipocyte differentia - tion , the cells undergo a morphological change from ﬁ broblastic to spherical cells ﬁ lled with lipid droplets ( Fan et al . , 1983 ) . The change in cell shape takes place early in the differentiation process prior to the up - regulation of many adipocyte speci ﬁ c genes and in association with cytoskeletal changes including decreased actin synthesis and actin reorganization ( Antras et al . , 1989 ) . Altered actin organization in ﬂ uences cytoskeletal tension which has been demonstrated to play a Stem Cell Research 15 ( 2015 ) 281 – 289 ☆ Author contributions in the study : L . Chen and M .

Similarly , during chondrocyte differentiation of hMSCs , signi ﬁ cant changes in cell shape that transform from a ﬁ broblast - liketo a circularmorphology leading to a signi ﬁ cant increase in cell volume ( Xu et al . , 2008 ) . Similar - ly , the regulatory role of actin dynamics in chondrocyte differentiation has been supported by a number of experiments . Actin - disruptingcom - pounds , such as cytochalasin D , stimulate chondrogenesis ( Loty et al . , 1995 ) . In addition , intracellular kinases induced by adhesion signaling from extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins , regulate chondrocyte differ - entiation through changes in actin cytoskeleton ( Woods et al . , 2005 , 2007 ; Nurminsky et al . , 2007 ) . We became interested in the potential role of ADF genes and actin dynamics during osteoblast ( OB ) differentiation of hMSCs for several reasons . First , actin and microtubules are abundant in osteoblasts ( Aubin et al . , 1983 ; Arena et al . , 1991 ) . During OB differentiation , cell morphology is found to alter from ﬁ broblast - like to cuboidal morpholo - gy ; this is accompanied by changes in actin cytoskeleton ( Lomri et al . , 1987 ) . Second , bone is a tissue that is sensitive to mechanical stimula - tion . Theresponsesof osteoblastic cells to the applied mechanical forces are transmitted through plasma membrane adhesion molecules and in - duce alterations in actin cytoskeletal organization ( Sakai et al . , 2011 ) . Third , some studies have reported that the upstream regulator of ADFs , such as Rho GTPase / Rho - Associated kinase ( Rock ) , extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components , and adhesion kinases , act as regulators for OB differentiation ( Harmey et al . , 2004 ; Hamidouche et al . , 2009 ; Mathews et al . , 2012 ) . However , evidence for the direct role of ADFs and dynamic organization of actin in MSCs biology and OB differentia - tion are not clear ( Kawano et al . , 2013 ; Shuang et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , weexaminedtheregulatoryroleofADFsandactincytoskeletal changes on lineage speci ﬁ c differentiation of hMSCs . We demonstrated that G - actin ( monomer ) and F - actin ( polymerized ) ratio was altered after induction of OB differentiation of hMSCs and was associated with signi ﬁ cant changes in expression of ADFs . Lowering the expression levels of ADFs enhanced the polymerization of actin ﬁ laments , enhanced cell viability , and OB differentiation of hMSCs . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Cell culture and OB differentiation of hMSCs Primary hMSCs were isolated from human bone marrow aspirate as described previously ( Stenderup et al . , 2004 ) . As a model for primary hMSCs , we employed the hMSC - TERT cell created in our laboratory by overexpression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) gene ( Simonsen et al . , 2002 ) . hMSC - TERT exhibits all the characteristics of primary MSC in vitro and form normal heterotopic bone when implanted in vivo ( Simonsen et al . , 2002 ) . Cells were grown in Minimal Essential Media ( MEM ) without Phenol red and L - glutamine , supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 2 mM Glutamax , 100 units / ml penicillin , and 100 μ g / ml streptomycin ( Gibco - Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , referred to as standard growth medium . Invitro OBdifferentiationofhMSCwascarriedoutusingOBin - duction medium containing standard growth medium supplemented with 10 - 8 M dexamethasone , 0 . 2 mM L - ascorbic acid , 10 mM β - glycerophosphate ( Sigma ) , and 10 mM 1 . 25 - vitamin - D3 ( Leo® pharma ) . 2 . 2 . Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and Alizarin red S ( AZR ) staining ALP cytochemical staining was performed on cultured cells by rins - ing the cell layer with PBS followed by ﬁ xation in acetone / citrate ( 1 . 5 : 1 , v : v ) buffer ( pH 4 . 2 ) for 5 minutes at room temperature . The cells were incubated with buffer containing 0 . 2 mg / ml naphthol AS - TR phosphate ( Sigma ) . After incubation for one hour at 37 °C , the cell layer was washed with deionized water . Alizarin red S staining was employed to assess the presence of in vitro formed mineralized matrix . The medium was removed , and the cell layer was rinsed with PBS and ﬁ xed in 70 % ethanol for 1 hour at - 20 °C . The cell layer was washed with deionized water . The ﬁ xed cells were stained with 40 mM Alizarin red S pH 4 . 2 ( Sigma ) for 10 minutes at room temperature . The cell layer was washed with deionized water . For quantitative assessment of the degree of mineralization , the color was eluted by 10 % ( wt / vol ) cetylpyridinium chloride ( Sigma ) for 1 h and quanti ﬁ ed by spectropho - tometric absorbance measurements at OD570nm ( Gregory et al . , 2004 ) . 2 . 3 . ALP activity assay ALP activity assay was performed in the96 - well plate . Cell number ( i . e . the number of viable cells ) was determined by adding the CellTiter - Blue solution ( Promega ) for 1 hour and measured the ﬂ uores - cence at wavelength of 579 Ex / 584 Em . The cells were then rinsed with PBS and ﬁ xed in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde - 90 % ethanol for 30 seconds at room temperature . A reaction mixture containing 100 μ l 50 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 mMMgCl 2 ( Sigma ) and1 mg / mlof p - nitrophenyl phosphate ( Sigma ) wasaddedintoeachwellandincubatedat37°Cfor20minutes . The reactionwas stopped by adding50 μ l of 3 M NaOH . Absorbance was determined at 405 nm in an ELISA microplate reader . ALP enzymatic activity was normalized to cell number in each well . 2 . 4 . Cell transfection Small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) duplex oligos targeting DSTN , CFL1 , CFL2 , LIMK1 , as well as non - targeting duplex oligo ( siRNA negative controls ) werepurchased fromAmbion ( Life TechnologyInc . ) . These re - agents were transfected into hMSC - TERT at a ﬁ nal concentration of 12 nM for siRNA . All transfections were performed using Lipofecta - mine2000TransfectionReagent ( Invitrogen ) , accordingtothemanufac - turer ’ s instructions . 2 . 5 . Treatment with Cytochalasin D and Phalloidin during OB differentiation in hMSCs hMSCs were seeded in 24 - well plate or 96 - well plate and induced to osteogenic differentiation as described above . The media was changed every third day . Before media change , the cells were pre - treated with Cytochalstin D ( Sigma , C8273 ) ( 1 - 20 uM ) for 1 h or Phalloidin ( Sigma , P2141 ) ( 0 - 6 uM ) for 3 h . After treatment , cells were washed and incu - bated in differentiation medium . Equal volumes of DMSO solution was added into the corresponding controls wells . 2 . 6 . Actin staining and cell shape detection by high content cellomic analysis Cells were seeded at adensity of 2000 cells per well into clear bottom 96 - well CellCarrier ™ microtiter plates ( PerkinElmer ) , the Operetta® High Content Imaging System was used to study the cellular changes . Cells were washed with PBS , ﬁ xed with 4 % formaldehyde for 30 min , and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton ™ - X - 100 for 10 min . Subsequently , the cells were stained with a dye solution containing 10 μ g / mL 4 ' , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( Sigma - Aldrich® , D8417 ) and 5 μ g / mL Phalloidin - TRITC ( Sigma - Aldrich® , P1951 ) . Images were acquired on an Operetta® high content image System ( Perkin Elmer ) using a 10X high NA ( numerical apertures ) objective in wide - ﬁ eld mode . All pictures wereacquiredwiththesame contrast and brightness parameters . For quantitative analyses , individual cells were segmented based on the DAPI nuclear stain using the Find Nuclei building block in the Harmony® High Content Imaging and Analysis Software . The fol - lowing parameters were determined per cell : cell size ( area ) ( μ m2 ) , cell length ( μ m ) , cell width ( μ m ) , cell roundness , cell ratio ( width to length ) , nuclear size ( μ m2 ) , and nuclear roundness . The staining inten - sity of TRITC was measured in each well and normalized to the cell number . 282 L . Chen et al . / Stem Cell Research 15 ( 2015 ) 281 – 289 2 . 7 . G - actin / F - actin assay The ﬁ lamentous ( F - actin ) andmonomeractin ( G - actin ) incells were quantitated by G - actin / F - actin in vivo assay kit as manufacturer ’ s in - structions ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) . Cells were harvested by scraping in lysis and F - actin stabilization buffer . The homogenates were incubated at 37 °C for 10 mins , transferred to a pre - warmed ( 37 °C ) , ultracentri - fuge ( SORVALL / Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) , and spun at 100 , 000 g for 1 h at 37 °C to separate the globular ( G ) - actin ( supernatant ) and ﬁ lamentous ( F ) - actin fractions ( pellet ) . The pellets were re - suspended in ice - cold depolymeraizing buffer . All samples were diluted with the appropriate loading buffer and boiled for 5 min . The samples were further separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and Western blot analysis . The blots were scanned and the protein bands were subjected to intensity quanti ﬁ cation in ImageJ® software . The ratios of F - actin or G - actin in cells were calculated according to the density . 2 . 8 . Western blot analysis hMSC cells were washed in PBS and lysed inRIPA buffer ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with protease inhibitors ( Roche ) . After 1 h incubation at 4 °C , samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 12 , 000 rpm at 4 °C . Protein concentration was determined with Pierce Coomassie Plus Bradford assay ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) , and equal amounts of protein were loaded on a 10 % polyacrylamide gel ( Invitrogen ) . Blotted nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C . Mem - branes were incubated with HRP conjugated anti - mouse or anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) for 45 min at room temperature . The protein bands were visualized with Amersham ECL chemiluminescence detection system ( GE Healthcare Bio - Sciences Corp ) in X - ray ﬁ lms . Results were scanned and edited in Photoshop® . Antibodies ( total or phosphor ) speci ﬁ c for AKT , SMAD1 / 5 / 8 , ERK , RUNX2 and LIMK1 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology® . Antibodies for phos - CFL1 , total CFL1 were purchased from Abcam® . Antibodies for DSTN and α - tubulin were bought from Sigma® . The antibody for actin was bought with G - actin / F - actin in vivo assay kit ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) . All antibodies were used at 1 : 1000 dilutions except α - tubulin antibody ( 1 : 5000 ) in this study . 2 . 9 . Quantitative real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) For gene expression , total RNA was extracted with TriZoL reagent ( Invitrogen ) , and cDNA was prepared using revert Aid H minus ﬁ rst strand cDNA synthesis kit ( Fermentas ) . The primers that were employed are listed in Table S1 . The PCR products were visualized in real - time using SYBR Green I Supermix ( Bio - Rad ) and an iCycle instru - ment ( Bio - Rad ) using standard curve protocols normalized to beta - 2 - microglobulin ( B2m ) . The quantitative data presented are an average of duplicate or triplicate per independent experiment . 2 . 10 . In vivo heterotopic bone formation assay hMSC ( 5 × 10 5 cells / sample ) were loaded on 40 mg wet hydroxyapatite / tricalcium phosphate ( HA / TCP ) ( Zimmer ) , incubated at 37 °C overnight , and implanted subcutaneously on the dorsal side of 8 - week - old NOD . CB17 - Prkdcscid / J mice ( NOD / SCID ) as previously described ( Stenderup et al . , 2004 ; Abdallah et al . , 2008 ) . Implants were removed after 8 weeks , ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , decalci ﬁ ed in formic acid , and embedded in paraf ﬁ n . Sections ( 4 - μ m ) were cut and stained with eosin / hematoxlyin ( Bie & Berntsens , Denmark ) . Bone volume per total volume was quanti ﬁ ed as previously described ( Abdallah et al . , 2008 ) . All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with permissions issued by The Animal Experiments Inspectorate . 2 . 11 . Statistical analysis Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean ( SEM ) . Statistical testing was performed using Student ' s t - test to detect differences between groups . Differences were considered statistically signi ﬁ cant at P b 0 . 05 ( * ) , P b 0 . 001 ( * * ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Changes in cytoskeletal proteins expression during osteoblast ( OB ) differentiation of hMSCs We observed an association of changes in actin forms and expres - sions of ADFs during in vitro OB differentiation of hMSCs . In undifferen - tiated hMSCs , we measured that 46 % of actin is soluble ( G - actin ) and 54 % is polymeric ( F - actin ) . During the initial differentiation , until day 3 , there was a decrease of F - actin ( to around 40 % ) and increase of G - actin ( up to around 60 % ) . Following OB differentiation induction , we observed a gradual increase in polymeric actin ( F - actin ) that reached maximal levels on day 13 ( F - actin , 63 % ) ( Fig . 1A ) . The change in actin forms during OB differentiation was associated with changes in the expression levels of key ADFs . Levels of total CFL1 remained stable throughout the differentiation process , but levels of phosphory - lated ( P - ) CFL1 ( inactive form ) were increased . Conversely , DSTN levels increasedatthebeginningofdifferentiationanddecreasedfollowingin - duction of OB differentiation . The LIMK1 phosphorylation increased during OB differentiation , while the total LIMK1 was unchanged ( Fig . 1B ) . 3 . 2 . siRNA - mediated knock - down of Co ﬁ lin and Destrin expression enhanced OB differentiation of hMSCs in vitro and heterotopic bone formation in vivo In order to detect theroleof ADFs andactin dynamicsin OBdifferen - tiation , we employed siRNA - mediated knock down of the two key ADFs and examined the effects on OB differentiation of hMSCs . Knock down of CFL1 or DSTN in hMSCs blocked the protein expression in cells ( around 95 % , see Fig . S1 for real time PCR and Western blot analysis ) . Knocking down of CFL1 and DSTN both increased viable cell numbers on day 7 of OB differentiation , and decreasing DSTN has signi ﬁ cant Fig . 1 . Changesinmonomeric ( G - actin ) , polymericactin ( F - actin ) andactindepolymerizing factors ( ADFs ) during OB differentiation in hMSCs . Human stromal ( skeletal ) stem cells ( hMSCs ) were induced to osteoblast ( OB ) differentiation as evidenced by positive cytochemical staining of alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and Alizarin red ( AZR ) presented as scanned pictures of culture dishes ( B ) . Protein samples were harvested at differentiation day 0 , 3 , 7 , 10 and 13 . A ) Actins were separated by ultracentrifugation to F - actin and G - actin and subjected to Western Blot analysis ( upper part ) for quantitation of the ratio of F - actin and G - actin in cells ( lower part ) . D : Days after differentiation induction . B ) Total cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis of ADFs and LIMK1 . Alpha - tubulin was measured as protein loading control . Results show the representational data derivedfrom at least three independentexperiments . 283 L . Chen et al . / Stem Cell Research 15 ( 2015 ) 281 – 289 effect ( Fig . 2A & Fig . S2C ) . siRNA - mediated knockdown of CFL1 en - hanced OB differentiation of hMSCs evidenced by signi ﬁ cant increase in ALP staining at day 7 ( Fig . 2B ) and mineralized matrix formation at day 10 ( Fig . 2C ) of OB differentiation . For DSTN , the effects of knock down were more pronounced on mineralized matrix formation ( Fig . 2C ) . Similar results were observed upon siRNA - mediated knock down of CFL1 and DSTN in human bone marrow derived primary MSC ( Fig . S2 ) . Interestingly , knocking down of CFL2 , a muscle speci ﬁ c ADF , did not lead to detectable effects on OB differentiation ( Fig . S3 ) . To investigate the function of ADFs on bone formation , hMSCs transfected with siRNA against CFL1 and DSTN or corresponding non - target controls , were implanted subcutaneously into immune de ﬁ cient mice . Heterotopic bone formation was signi ﬁ cantly increased ( more than 1 . 5 times ) in implants of hMSCs de ﬁ cient in CFL1 or DSTN compared with control ( Fig . 2D , E ) . 3 . 3 . siRNA - mediated knockdown of CFL1 and DSTN increased polymerized actin ( F - actin ) and not change cell morphology of hMSCs To further detect the effects of siRNA - mediated knock down of CFL1 and DSTN on actin dynamics , we stained cells by TRITC - coupled Phalloidin that binds polymerized actin ﬁ laments ( F - actin ) . We exam - ined the morphological changes in the cells using high content imaging ( Fig . 3A ) . N Knockdown of CFL1 or DSTN did not affect cellular morphol - ogy i . e . nuclear size , nuclear roundness , cell size , cell width , cell length , ratio of cell width to length , and cell roundness ( Fig . 3B ) . We detected a signi ﬁ cantincreaseintheintensityofTRITC - Phalloidinstaining ( Fig . 3C ) suggesting increased polymerized actin ﬁ lament formation . This was con ﬁ rmed by direct measurement of F actin / G actin ratio ( Fig . 3D ) . 3 . 4 . Cytochalasin D and Phalloidin treatment led to signi ﬁ cant changes in OB differentiation in hMSCs . siRNA - mediated knock down of CFL1 or DSTN in hMSCs increased polymerized F - actin that was associated with enhanced OB differentia - tion of hMSCs . To con ﬁ rm that increased levels of actin polymerization exert signi ﬁ cant increase on the proliferation and OB differentiation of hMSCs , we treatedhMSCswithCytochalsinDandPhalloidin . Cytochala - sin D promotes depolymerizing actin and phalloidin stabilizes actin ﬁ laments ( Fig . S4 ) . Treating hMSCs with Cytochalasin D inhibited OB differentiation evidenced by a dose - dependent decrease in ALP activity and decreased mineralized matrix formation ( Fig . 4A ) . Con - versely , Phalloidin treated hMSCs exhibited increased ALP activity and mineralized matrix formation ( Fig . 4B ) . The effects of Cytochalasin D and Phalloidin on OB differentiation were also con ﬁ rmed in human primary bone marrow MSCs ( Fig . S5 ) and mouse bone marrow MSCs ( Fig . S6 ) . 3 . 5 . Inhibition of LIMK1 inhibited phosphorylation of Co ﬁ lin and OB differentiation of hMSCs . Duringthecourse of OB differentiationof hMSCs , phosphorylationof Co ﬁ lin was up - regulated ( Fig . 1 ) suggesting that phosphorylation of Co ﬁ lin mediates changes in OB differentiation . Co ﬁ lin is inactivated by the phosphorylation at Ser3 by LIM kinase ( LIMK ) and activated by phosphatase SSH1 . The spatially coordinated activities of LIMK and Co ﬁ lin phosphatase are required for regulating actin dynamics and con - trollingactin - dependentcellularprocesses ( Yang et al . , 1998 ) . Toexam - ine whether the Co ﬁ lin phosphorylation loop plays a regulatory role in Fig . 2 . siRNA - mediated knockdown of CFL1 and DSTN enhanced osteoblast differentiation in vitro and heterotopic bone formation of hMSCs in vivo . Human stromal ( skeletal ) stem cells ( hMSCs ) were cultured and transfected with siRNAs for CFL1 , DSTN or with non - target siRNA ( control ) . In vitro osteoblast ( OB ) differentiation : Twenty four hours following transfection , the cells were induced to OB differentiation as described in Material & Methods . Cell viability ( A ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) activity and ALP staining ( B ) and mineralized matrix formation visualized by Alizarin red S ( AZR ) staining and quantitation ( C ) were performed . Results were presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean ( SEM ) of at least three independent experiments . For in vivo heterotopic bone formation , siRNA - transfected cells were implanted coupled to hydroxyapatite / tricalcium phosphate ( HA / TCP ) scaffold subcutaneously into immune de ﬁ cient NOD / SCID mice .

Chen et al . / Stem Cell Research 15 ( 2015 ) 281 – 289 OB differentiation of hMSCs , we treated hMSC with LIMK inhibitor ( LIMKi ) . LIMK inhibitor reduced the phosphorylated Co ﬁ lin in a dose dependent manner from 100 nM to 10 μ M ( Fig . 5A ) , and concomitantly inhibited OB differentiation , as revealed by a dose - dependent decrease in cell viability , ALP staining and activity , as well as a reduction in mineralized matrix formation shown by Alizarin red ( AZR ) staining Fig . 3 . siRNA - mediated knockdown of CFL1 and DSTN increased polymerized actin ( F - actin ) levels but did not change cell morphology of human stromal ( skeletal ) stem cells ( hMSCs ) . hMSCs were cultured and transfected with siRNAs for CFL1 , DSTN or with non - target siRNA ( control ) . After 24 hours , the cells were stained with TRITC - Phalloidin and DAPI ( A ) . Scale bar : 100 μ m . Analysis of changes of cell morphology was carried out by the Operetta® High Content Imaging System . Cell morphology and intensity of TRITC - Phalloidin binding actin were analyzed by the Harmony® software ( B & C ) .

( B , C ) Cell viability was measured on day 7 in hMSCs treated with Phalloidin ( 3 hours each other day ) or Cytochalsin D ( 1 hour each other day ) during OB differentiation . ( D ) The activation of intracellular signaling pathways ( FAK , P38 , JNK , Erk , Akt , Smad1 / 5 / 8 ) was analyzed by Western Blot analysis . Left part : hMSCs were transfected by siRNA for non - target control , or CFL1 and DSTN . Right part : hMSCs were treated by Cytochalasin D ( 5 μ M , 1 hour ) or Phallodin ( 3 mM , 3 hours ) . Total cell lysates were subjected Western blot analysis . Data represents representative resultfrom at least three independent experiments . 286 L . Chen et al . / Stem Cell Research 15 ( 2015 ) 281 – 289 ( Fig . 5B , C ) . siRNA - mediated knock down of LIMK1 in hMSCs led to sim - ilar results ( Fig . S7 ) . We also checked the knockdown of phosphatase SSH1 in hMSCs , but the knockdown of SSH1 in cells induced severe cell death of hMSCs ( data not shown ) . 3 . 6 . Changes in actin dynamics affect cell viability As mentioned above , change in actin dynamic assembly was associ - ated with changes in cell viability . To further analyze this phenomenon , we determined changes in the viable cells during the course of OB dif - ferentiation . siRNA - mediated knock down of CFL1orDSTNin hMSCs in - creased the cell proliferation ( Fig . 6A ) suggesting that enhancing actin polymerization improves cell survival . This notion was corroborated by treating the cells with Cytochalasin D and Phalloidin . Cytochalasin D reduced and Phalloidin increased the number of viable cells ( Fig . 6B , C ) . Similarly , LIMKi reduced viable cell numbers ( Fig . 5B ) . 3 . 7 . Changes in actin dynamics are associated with alterations in FAK , p38 , and JNK signalling SincechangesinactindynamicsaffectshMSCs viability anddifferen - tiation , we examined changes in a number of signaling pathways knowntobeimportantinhMSCsbiology . Wedetectedincreasedactiva - tion of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , p38 , and JNK kinases following siRNA - mediated inhibition of CFL1 and DSTN expression and following treatment with Phalloidin . The opposite effects were observed following treatment with Cytochalasin D . We did not detect changes in the activation at ERK , Akt , and Smad1 / 5 / 8 pathways ( Fig . 6D ) 4 . Discussion Actin cytoskeleton undergoes cycles of actin assembly that exists in two states : a monomeric state ( globular , G - actin ) and a ﬁ brous state ( ﬁ lamentous , F - actin ) . A variety of actin ﬁ lament lengths and shapes are established by actin - depolymerizing factors ( ADFs ) and other actin binding factors that are responsible for changes in structure and mor - phology of eukaryotic cells under different physiological conditions . Among the ADFs , active Co ﬁ lin ( non - phosphorylated ) and DSTN bind to F - actin without capping and severe the actin ﬁ lament ( F - actin ) into monomers free ends actin ( G - actin ) . Polymerization of actin is regulat - ed by a series of kinases , suchasGTPaseRhoA , RhoA kinase ( ROCK ) , and LIM kinases , which phosphorylates the actin depolymerizing protein Co ﬁ lin and stabilizes actin ﬁ laments ( Lodish et al . , 2000 ) . In the present study , we demonstrated that changes in the levels of ADFs lead to changes in viability and OB differentiation of hMSCs . siRNA - mediated knocking down of CFL1 or DSTN enhanced OB differentiation and het - erotopic bone formation of hMSCs in vivo . Our results con ﬁ rm part of the ﬁ ndings in previous related studies ( Rodriguez et al . , 2004 ; Sonowal et al . , 2013 ) , and ful ﬁ l the map where the balance of actin as - sembly ( depolymerization and polymerization ) is a regulatory factor for viability and OB differentiation of hMSCs and that these effects are mediated through a number of intracellular signaling pathways ( Fig . 7 ) . We observed that changes in actin dynamics induce alterations in cell viability . A number of studies have indicated that factors regulating actin cytoskeleton , can exert regulatory functions on cell proliferation . For ex - ample , Co ﬁ lin phosphorylation mediates proliferation in response to platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) in rat aortic smooth muscle cells ( Won et al . , 2008 ) , and inhibition of Co ﬁ lin - 1 expression blocks PDGF - induced proliferation in endometrium ( Wang et al . , 2013 ) . Conversely , ectopic - expressionofofADFs andCo ﬁ linsuppressthemotilityandprolif - erationofhumanlungcancercells ( Leeetal . , 2005 ) . Theseresults suggest thatdirectregulationofADFsandactinreassemblycanaffectcellprolifer - ationandviability . ItispossiblethatADFsandactinassemblycanexertdi - rect regulation of cell cycle genes . It is also possible that actin reassembly provide mechanical structure for cell division ( Warn and Magrath , 1983 ; Kaji et al . , 2003 ) and the mitotic process ( Tsai et al . , 2009 ) . ADFs have been reported to regulate cell differentiation in a number of tissues . CFL1 and DSTN are required for ureteric bud branching morphogenesis ( Kuureetal . , 2010 ) . ConditionaldeletionofCFL1inneu - ronal cells enhances cell differentiation ( Bellenchi et al . , 2007 ) . In addi - tion , Co ﬁ lin and phospho - Co ﬁ lin expression are increased in conditions favoring myo ﬁ broblast differentiation . Knockdown of CFL1 inhibited collagen gel contraction and reduced myo ﬁ broblast differentiation ( Pho et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , CFL1 has been reported to be activated at the time of podosome belt assembly during osteoclast differentiation ( Blangy et al . , 2012 ) . We report that ADFs participate in the regulation of OB differentiation of hMSCs and provide a link between changes in cytoskeleton and lineage speci ﬁ cation of hMSCs . HumanDSTNandCFL1aremorethan70 % identicalinaminoacidse - quence . DSTN has a much higher actin depolymerizing activity than Co ﬁ lin ( Yeoh et al . , 2002 ) which is explained by sequence differences at the F - actin - binding site ( Pope et al . , 2004 ) . CFL1 de ﬁ ciency is embry - onic lethal at E11 . 5 – 12 . 5 and displays defects in neural tube closure and neural crest cell migration despite high expression of DSTN ( Gurniak et al . , 2005 ) . DSTN de ﬁ cient mice are viable but have corneal defects leading to eventual blindness in adult mice . Conversely , DSTN de ﬁ cient micehavenormalbraindevelopment ( Ikedaetal . , 2003 ) . Wefoundthat lowering both DSTN and CFL1 could enhance OB differentiation . How - ever , part of DSTN ’ s effect on cell differentiation may be mediated through enhancement of cell viability . The observed differences can be caused by differences in binding af ﬁ nity with actin or actin depolymer - ization ef ﬁ ciency . Further studiesare needed to study these hypotheses . In eukaryotic cells , Co ﬁ lin is an important dynamic regulator of actin assembly . Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation at the N - terminal Fig . 7 . A working model illustrating the effect of changes in actin depolymerizing factors ( ADFs ) on cell viability and osteoblast differentiation of human stromal ( skeletal ) stem cells ( hMSCs ) . CFL : Co ﬁ lin ; DSTN : Destrin ; LIMK : LIM kinase ; FAK : Focal adhesion kinase ; p38 : p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ; JNK : c - Jun N - terminal kinase . 287 L . Chen et al . / Stem Cell Research 15 ( 2015 ) 281 – 289 Serine 3 that inhibits its activity and the binding to G - actin . Dephosphor - ylation at Ser - 3 recovers CFL1 activity . LIM kinase ( LIMK ) is one of the key kinases that regulate the activity of ADFs through phosphorylation of the actin depolymerizingprotein Co ﬁ lin ( inactive Co ﬁ lin ) thereby sta - bilizing actin ﬁ lament formation within the cell . In our study , inhibition of LIMK by a chemical inhibitor or speci ﬁ c siRNA , resulted in inhibition of activation and phosphorylation of Co ﬁ lin and inhibition of hMSCs via - bility and OB differentiation . Our ﬁ ndings provide a molecular explana - tion to previous observations of presence of low bone mass phenotype in LIMK 1 de ﬁ cient mice ( Kawano et al . , 2013 ) . In addition to LIMK1 , other upstream kinases are involved in the regulation of Co ﬁ lin phos - phorylation and its activity . The Rho small GTPase family and its down - stream effectors , Rho - associated kinase ( ROCK ) and p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) , can both phosphorylate activate LIMK and therefore inac - tivate Co ﬁ lin ( Zigmond , 1996 ; Bernard , 2007 ) . Another kinase named testis - speci ﬁ c kinase ( TESK ) can inactivate Co ﬁ lin through phosphoryla - tion and is dependent on signaling through integrin ( Toshima et al . , 2001 ) . In contrast , slingshot ( SSH ) phosphatase and chronophin ( CIN ) have been shown to activate Co ﬁ lin by dephosphorylating at Serine 3 residue and suppressing the assembly of actin ﬁ laments ( Niwa et al . , 2002 ; Huang et al . , 2006 ) . Many studies have demonstrated that the above mentioned kinases , such as Rho , Rac , Rock , LIMK and 14 - 3 - 3 , are possible regulators of OB differentiation ( Liu et al . , 2007 ; Yamashita et al . , 2008 ; Prowse et al . , 2013 ) . Our study suggest that these signaling pathways can mediate their biological effects through changes in actin cytoskeletal organization through conversion of ADFs and Co ﬁ lin in cells and further signaling through FAK , JNK , and p38 MAP kinases sig - nalingpathways . Several studies have reported that the main actin bind - ing proteins in vertebrate such as thymosin - beta 4 and pro ﬁ lin regulate cell differentiation , e . g . odontogenic differentiation or sternum develop - ment ( Lee et al . , 2013 ; Someya et al . , 2015 ) related to Akt , P38 , JNK , ERK , BMP pathways , followed by transcriptional regulation of Runx2 and Osterix ( Lee et al . , 2013 ; Sonowal et al . , 2013 ; Someya et al . , 2015 ) . Since there exists over 60 families of actin - binding proteins that in ﬂ u - ence actin ﬁ lament assembly / disassembly , it will be very interesting to explore the networks associated with actin assembly ( composed by ki - nases and actin binding proteins ) during different lineage commitment and differentiations of stem cells .
