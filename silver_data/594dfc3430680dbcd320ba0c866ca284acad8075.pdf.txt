Multi - word expressions ( MWEs ) are characterised by non - compositionality as they comprise two or more words , which have a unique meaning not traceable to any of the combined words . This study examines the syntactic behaviour of MWEs in Yorulish code - switched grammar , with an eye to the meaning before and after code - switching / mixing . The adopted theoreti - cal framework is a combination of Myers - Scotton’s Matrix Language Frame theory and Chomsky’s Transformational Generative Grammar . Data were pur - posively sampled from standard dictionaries and textbooks on English and Yorùbá languages , and code - switched / mixed with words from the alternate language . The MWEs selected are idioms ( from English and Yorùbá ) ; phrasal verbs , phrasal - prepositional verbs and prepositional verbs ( from English ) ; and splitting verbs and serial verb constructions ( from Yorùbá ) . The study suggests that switching is allowed when components of MWEs are relatively free as in English prepositional verbs , but barred when they are fixed as in Yorùbá split - ting verbs and idioms . Nevertheless , apart from idioms where both English and Yorùbá substrates resist switching , the other Yorùbá MWEs are more imper - vious to switching than do those of English origin , which suggests that Yorùbá is the base language . Keywords : Yorulish , code - mixing , multi - word expressions , Matrix Language Frame theory 1 . Introduction Yorulish is a term coined by Lamidi and Ajongolo ( 2001 ) . It is a blend of Yorùbá and English , and refers to the combined substrates of Yorùbá - English code - mixed / switched linguistic variety . Code - switching is described as a switch from one Ghana Journal of Linguistics 6 . 2 : 30 - 55 ( 2017 ) 31 language to another in the course of speaking with respect to topic , tone , audience , situation , mood , etc . ( Bentahila and Davies 1983 ) . Code - mixing on the other hand is the mixture of words from languages in contact ( Essien 1995 ) . They are both referred to respectively as inter - sentential and intra - sentential code - switching ( Muysken 2000 ) . This study is based on intra - sentential code - switching , otherwise called code - mixing . Multi - word expressions ( MWEs ) are words that are usually collocated every - where they occur in sentences . Such expressions , which are found in different lan - guages , include ( but are not limited to ) idioms ( from English and Yorùbá ) , phrasal verbs , prepositional verbs , and phrasal - prepositional verbs ( from English ) ; and splitting verbs and serial verbs ( from Yorùbá ) . This paper discusses all MWEs identified in the preceding sentence . The MWEs refer to combinations of a lexical verb and one or more words or particles . The particles are either adverbs or prepositions or both . When the particle is an adverb , the multi - word combination is a phrasal verb . When the particle is a preposition , the combination is a prepositional verb ; and when both adverb and preposition particles co - occur with the verb , the combination is a phrasal - prepositional verb ( Quirk and Greenbaum , 1979 ; Greenbaum and Nelson , 2002 ; van Gelderen , 2010 ) . All these originate from the English language . The splitting verbs and the serial verbs discussed here originate from Yorùbá language . Splitting verbs have the peculiar nature of either occurring alone or being split into two ( Awobuluyi 1978 ) , whereas serial verbs refer to a series of verbs that occur adjacent to one another in a structure ( Lawal 1986 ) . Regardless of the combina - tion , the MWE constitutes a unit of meaning ; it is not necessarily an aggregate of the meaning of the individual components . The combined words behave like a single verb . In this paper , the behaviour of MWE verbs in Yorulish code - switching is explored within the purview of Matrix Language Frame and Transformational Generative Gram - mar , a competence grammar . The paper looks at issues of compositionality , grammati - cality and acceptability . 2 . Syntax - semantics interface in Yorulish Code - switching This eclectic study is being carried out from a combination of different theories and concepts . The first is Matrix Language Frame ( MLF ) , propounded by Myers - Scot - ton . Myers - Scotton ( 1993b , 2002 ) has tried to formalise a psycholinguistic / grammati - cal theory of code - switching . She presents the Matrix Language Frame ( MLF ) , which posits the occurrence of a main or base ( or host ) language and an embedded language in a code - switched grammar . The main language is said to donate most of the functional categories in a code - switched structure . She justifies this through the two twin concepts of ( i ) Morpheme Order Principle , in which case the order of the morpheme will be in MT Lamidi : The Syntax of Multi - Word Expressions in Yorulish Code - Mixing _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 32 the Matrix Language ( ML ) structure and ( ii ) System Morpheme principle , in which the system morphemes come from the host language . The second is Chomsky’s transformational generative grammar ( TGG ) . Alt - hough TGG has many models , this paper will be concerned with the concept of com - petence , which runs through them all . Competence is the ideal native speaker / hearer’s ability to use a language flawlessly . This study is located in this theory , since it is con - cerned with the acceptability and grammaticality of expressions . A sentence is gram - matical if it obeys all the relevant rules guiding the formation of the sentence ; other - wise , not . Borsley ( 1991 ) draws a line between grammaticality and acceptability . A structure that is grammatical may be acceptable or unacceptable . A structure that vio - lates the rule ( s ) of grammar is unacceptable . When a structure is too long for the per - ceptive ability of an individual , it is considered unacceptable . In the same vein , a sen - tence that requires pen and paper analysis before it can be understood is also unaccepta - ble . This study will be looking at structures in the context of the switching of codes from one to the other of the languages involved in code - switching . In this sense , the switch from one code to another is a major means of determining whether a structure is grammatical or acceptable . In other words , if a structure tolerates switching , the prod - uct of the switching will be grammatical and acceptable . If , however , a structure resists switching , the product of switching any of its components will be considered ungram - matical and unacceptable . Of particular relevance to this study is the concept of head . The head is the most important word in a phrase . It is unique and obligatory in phrases . The head has been defined by many scholars ( such as Jackendoff , 1977 and Chomsky , 1986 ) ; but we shall be guided by the definitions offered in Hoeksema ( 1990 : 2 ) : ( A ) Semantic : The head of A is a hyperonym of A , i . e . when A denotes a set X , the example of A denotes a superset of X ( B ) Distributional : The head of X is a part with the same distribution as X . ( C ) Morphosyntactic : The head is the locus of Inflection ( D ) Technical : The head of X is the part , which determines the category of X . This study adopts these definitions as they determine the grammaticality and acceptability of elements under the scope of the head . The study focuses particularly on the implication of the technical and semantic definitions because they account for subcategorisation and semantic selection features . While syntax deals with the arrangement of words in an expression , semantics deals with the meaning of such expressions . Regardless of the syntactic structure , words Ghana Journal of Linguistics 6 . 2 : 30 - 55 ( 2017 ) 33 can occur freely or co - occur with other words regularly with constant meaning ( collo - cation ) . One area of syntax – semantics interface is compositionality . “ Compositionality refers to the degree to which the meaning of a MWE can be predicted by combining the meanings of its components” ( Korkontzelos and Manandhar , 2009 : 65 ) . MWEs or collocated expressions are said to be compositional if each word contributes to the to - tality of the meaning of an expression . According to Carnie ( 2010 : 22 ) , The hypothesis of compositionality holds that the syntactic tree is the road map for this semantic computation . That is , semantic composition applies precisely in the order specified by the hierarchical constituent structure . If two elements x and y form a constituent excluding z , then the meaning of the ( x , y ) pair is computed before z is added into the mix . This means that words participate structurally and semantically in the realiza - tion of the structure and meaning of expressions . Each word has a meaning and belongs to a syntactic category . So , when a word is removed from an expression , it leaves a gap in the structure and meaning of the expression . For instance , the expression , a young man , is compositional , referring to a male that has not matured . If we remove young , the meaning is reduced because the meaning of young has been left out in the overall interpretation . Conversely , a structure is not compositional if we cannot identify the contribu - tion of each of its component parts . In other words , all the words in the structure form a unit of meaning . In this sense , when a word is removed from the group , the initial meaning is disrupted or unrealised . Rather , we get a literal meaning or a nonsense meaning . The whole expression is listed in the lexicon as a unit of meaning . In the following example , for instance , if any word is taken away , the total meaning collapses . In eat humble pie , if we take away humble , the meaning changes and becomes compo - sitional : eat pie . This is a literal translation . Sometimes , however , certain collocated expressions can be twisted or modified . This , however , makes the expression suscepti - ble to literal translations or changes in meaning . For instance , look can be collocated with different particles or prepositions . Hence , we have look out ( be vigilant / face ) , look in ( look briefly ) and look for ( search for ) . Considering the different meanings indicated against each expression in the brackets , the first two belong to MWEs , the last does not . The expressions with deep / embedded meaning as opposed to those with literal mean - ings include idioms and metaphors . Regardless of the compositional status of MWEs , however , there is an internal unity orchestrated by the head and the complements in conformity with the rules of the language . If , for instance , a syntactic rule is broken , MT Lamidi : The Syntax of Multi - Word Expressions in Yorulish Code - Mixing _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 34 the expression becomes unacceptable . Hence , MWEs also have internal syntactic rules guiding their components . Given the fact that a set of words also with unified meaning allows splits or interchange with particles and some expressions have a unified meaning for a number of words without switches , this study investigates the phenomenon of code - mixing in both cases , to see the speech patterns and how mixing occurs as well as how meaning is affected by the phenomenon . With MLF theory in the background , and Competence and Compositionality at the forefront , the paper is expected to distinguish between lit - eral and idiomatic expressions through the phenomenon of code - mixing . This study looks at the syntax - semantics relationship of words within MWEs . We examine how MWEs behave when they are code - mixed and identify what makes them grammatical or ungrammatical . 3 . Previous studies Several studies in code - switching have been carried out on different aspects of the phenomena . These include the motivation for switching between languages ( Myers - Scotton 1993a , Auer 1998 ) , classification of switches ( Muysken 2000 ) , psycholin - guistic perspectives on code - switching ( Green 1998 , Treffers - Daller 1998 , Toribio 2001 ) , the grammatical basis of code - switching as well as constraints that apply to each pair of mixed languages ( Poplack 1980 , Bentahila and Davies 1983 , Myers - Scotton 1993b , 2000 , MacSwan 2000 , van Gelderen and MacSwan 2008 ) , bilingual children ’ s code - switching ( Treffers - Daller 1998 , Hoeksema 1990 , Carnie 2010 , Cantone & M ü l - ler 2008 , Liceras et al . 2008 ) and code - switching in e - mails ( Hinrichs 2006 ) . Many studies have also been carried out on pairs of languages , but very few exist on code - switching involving more than two languages ( Ogechi 2002 , Kyuchukov 2002 ) and , still less are studies on written code - switching especially on virtual speech communities ( Montes - Alcalá , 2007 ; Lamidi , 2013 ) . Studies have also been conducted on pairs of languages such as Spanish - English ( Pfaff 1979 ; Poplack 1980 , Sankoff and Poplack 1981 , Franco and Solorio 2007 ) ; Ar - abic - French ( Bentahila and Davies 1983 ) , American Sign Language - English ( Lucas and Valli , 1992 ) , English - Creole ( Hinrichs 2006 ) , Swahili - English ( Myers - Scotton 1993 a & b , 2002 ) , Turkish - Dutch ( Backus and Eversteijni 2002 ) and Yorùbá - English ( Banjo 1983 , Goke - Pariola 1983 , Lamidi 2013 ) . In Yor ù b á - English CS , the studies have been largely on sociolinguistics ( see Banjo 1983 , 1996 ; Goke - Pariola , 1983 ; Bamiro , 2006 , Ayeomoni , 2006 ; and Babalola & Taiwo 2009 ) and on morphology and syntax ( see Lamidi & Ajongolo , 2001 ; Lamidi 2003 , 2004 , 2008 a & b and 2013 ) . Lamidi and Ajongolo ( 2001 ) discuss the morphosyn - Ghana Journal of Linguistics 6 . 2 : 30 - 55 ( 2017 ) 35 tactic structure of heads in Yorulish code - switched words . The study identifies mor - phemes from the Yorùbá substrate as heads of their respective code - switched words , thus confirming Myers - Scotton ’ s MLF theory . The same conclusion was reached in Lamidi ( 2004 ) which looks at the scopal authority of heads in the Yorùbá - English code - mixed grammar . According to the study , functional heads such as complementiser and determiner regulate the structure of a phrase ; lexical heads determine the type of word that follows them . Both head types subcategorise or determine the structure of their complements ( which fall within their scope ) . The study concludes that Yorùbá is the Matrix language . These two papers are relevant to the current effort , which also dis - cusses Yoru ̀ ba ́ - English code - mixing . It is important to emphasise that the current study involves syntax - semantics interface , which the earlier study did not consider . The study will benefit from the concept of head and scopal authority within phrases . It will explore grammaticality and acceptability from the perspective of subcategorisation and s - selec - tion . Another relevant study is Lamidi ( 2008a ) . It investigates hybrid verbs in Yorùbá - English code - mixing . The study identifies clean verbs , which exhibit the nor - mal features of verbs from English and Yorùbá from their respective source substrates , and hybrid verbs , which have idiosyncratic features different from what obtains in their respective source languages . Lamidi ( 2004 ) is principally on how a head regulates the items that are dependent on it in its scope and Lamidi ( 2008a ) is principally on the nature of lexical verbs . However , the current study is on multi - word expressions ; and , to my knowledge , no study so far has discussed Yorùbá - English code - mixing in multi - word expressions , least of all , its syntax - semantics interface , grammaticality and ac - ceptability , which are the foci of the current paper . Therefore , the current study pushes forward the discussion in Lamidi ( 2008a ) as it explores the behaviour of a variety of code - switched MWE structures in different contexts . 4 . Data Collection Data comprising MWEs were collected from the Oxford Advanced Learners’ Dictionary of English ( for English language ) and Awobuluyi ( 1978 ) ( for Yorùbá lan - guage ) . Additional data were also generated through introspection by the researcher , who has native speaker competence in Yorùbá . The data collected were phrasal verbs , prepositional verbs and phrasal prepositional verbs ( from English ) ; serial verb con - structions , splitting verbs ( from Yorùbá ) ; and idioms ( English and Yorùbá ) . Of all these , those MWEs that are relatively in common use among the Nigerian populace were purposively selected for code - mixing with the other language . The data from Eng - lish were code - mixed with words from Yorùbá while data from Yorùbá were code - MT Lamidi : The Syntax of Multi - Word Expressions in Yorulish Code - Mixing _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 36 mixed with words from English . Idioms from English were code - mixed with words from Yorùbá while idioms from Yorùbá were code - mixed with words from English . The products of the code - mixing processes were analysed for grammaticality and ac - ceptability . In the data that follows , English expressions are presented in italic typeface while Yorùbá expressions have normal typeface . This is to distinguish the two codes in each structure . The MWEs are presented in bold print . 5 . Phrasal Verbs A phrasal verb consists of a verb and an adverb , both forming a unit of meaning . However , in English grammar , because the adverb ‘ no longer always expresses place or direction ’ ( van Gelderen , 2010 : 91 ) , it is called a particle in this context . Quirk and Greenbaum ( 1979 ) have classified phrasal verbs into two : intransitive phrasal verbs and transitive phrasal verbs . In Yorulish grammar , the phrasal verb is contributed by the English substrate . 5 . 1 Intransitive Phrasal Verbs Transitive phrasal verbs take objects while intransitive phrasal verbs do not . Here are some examples of intransitive phrasal verbs from the Yorulish grammar : 1a . Plane y ẹ n ti take off . Plane the ASP taken off ‘The plane has taken off . ’ b . Olú turn up n í meeting y ẹ n unexpectedly . Olú turned up at meeting that unexpectedly ‘Olu turned up at the meeting unexpectedly . ’ c . Ṣ é ó ń catch on ? Q 3SG CONT catch on ‘Does s / he catch on ? ’ d . Man y ẹ n break down lój ì jì . Man that break down suddenly ‘That man broke down suddenly . ’ Ghana Journal of Linguistics 6 . 2 : 30 - 55 ( 2017 ) 37 e . Ó ń play around 3sg CONT play around ‘He’s playing around . ’ The first observation about these sentences is that the system morphemes are usually from the Yorùbá substrate . Normally , Yorùbá verbs are always not inflected for tense and agreement . This lack of inflection also occurs on the first words in the phrasal verbs . In the foregoing examples , for instance , the tense and agreement features of Eng - lish are replaced by the non - inflected form of Yorùbá , even on English verbs . In addi - tion , function words such as perfective and progressive aspect markers ( ti and ń respec - tively ) are in Yorùbá . The clitic ( ó ) , the determiner ( y ẹ n ) and the question marker ( ṣ é ) are all donated by the Yorùbá substrate . In addition , following the Morpheme Order Principle , we can see that the word order favoured is that of Yorùbá . For instance , meet - ing y ẹ n has the structure N + Determiner , whereas the reverse , Determiner + N , is the structure permitted in English . English polar questions involve the use of auxiliary - NP inversion , but the polar question in ( 1c ) uses a question marker that is attached sen - tence - initially . These features are peculiar to the Yorùbá substrate . In these and subse - quent examples in this paper , these are the overriding features . Hence , we confirm that Yorùbá is the host language ( following the ideas of Myers - Scotton , 1993 ) in the code - switched grammar under discussion as observed in previous literature . 1 Considering the examples from the perspective of MWEs , the phrasal verbs , as a unit , do not have objects . Rather , they are either left bare ( 1a , c & e ) or followed by adverbials ( 1b & d ) . In all the examples , switching of other elements in the sentences are permitted but switching items within phrasal verbs to Yorùbá is not permitted . Oth - erwise , the sentence will be barred as in the following : 2a . * Ol ú take kúrò b . * Olú turn l ó kè ni meeting y ẹ n unexpectedly . c . * Man y ẹ n kán off l ó j ì jì d . * Ṣé o ń mú on ? e . * O ń play àyíká 1 To avoid repetitions of the same ideas , the status of Yorùbá as the host language in the code - switched grammar will not be pursued further in other examples below . Readers may wish to read up on the subject in Banjo ( 1983 ) , Goke - Pariola , ( 1983 ) and Bamiro ( 2006 ) , among others . MT Lamidi : The Syntax of Multi - Word Expressions in Yorulish Code - Mixing _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 38 As examples ( 2a - e ) show , switching of this class of phrasal verbs into Yorùbá causes ungrammaticality and is therefore barred . What accounts for the ungrammati - cality ? We can trace this to the heads of the phrasal verbs : take , turn , kán , mú and play . The heads , following the ideas of Lamidi ( 2004 ) , have scope over the particles and determine the type of word that follows them and whether such words or particles can be switched from English to Yorùbá without negative repercussions . As observed in examples ( 2a - e ) , switching is not allowed between the head and the particle in the in - transitive phrasal verb . However , a phrase of Yorùbá origin can come before and / or after the phrasal verb as seen in ( 1a - e ) . Hence , the intransitive phrasal verb can be seen as an embedded island ( Myers - Scotton , 1993b ) . The structures also fail on the pedestal of acceptability . This is because the meanings do not tally with the intended ones de - picted in the translations . By invoking Hoeksema’s descriptions of head above , we can identify the words take , turn , catch , break and play as heads in their respective phrasal verbs in ( 1a - e ) . The heads have semantic content , which determines the meaning of the respective struc - tures . They occur at the beginning of the expressions ( Distributional content ) , they col - locate with the particles and earn the structure its name ( Technical content ) and they are changeable , depending on agreement or tense factors : he turned up ; she turns up ( Morphosyntactic content ) . Hence , in this and subsequent examples from the English substrate , the first word in the MWE is the head . This conclusion appears to contradict Williams’ ( 1982 ) Right Hand Head Rule , which states that the inflection to the head occurs at the right - hand side of the word . To accommodate this claim , we shall posit that the inflections occur to the right - hand side of the word which is within another structure . However , since this is beyond the scope of this paper , and it will no longer be pursued here . 5 . 2 Transitive phrasal verbs As in lexical verbs , the transitive phrasal verbs require an object . This fact is exempli - fied in the following : 3a . W ọ́ n switch on iná sitting room they switch on light sitting room ‘They switched on the light in the sitting room . ’ b . A set up committee tuntun we set up committee new ‘We set up a new committee . ’ Ghana Journal of Linguistics 6 . 2 : 30 - 55 ( 2017 ) 39 c . A ti call off strike y ẹ n We ASP call off strike that ‘We have called off that strike . ’ d . Ó f ẹ́ find out nǹkan t í w ọ́ n ń plan 3sg want find out what that they CONT plan ‘S / he wants to find out what they are planning . ’ e . Òun l ’ ó bring over à w ọ n boys y ẹ n . 3sg FOC bring over PL boys that ‘It was s / he that brought over those boys . ’ In examples ( 3a - e ) , each of the sentences may not be complete if the noun phrases adjoining the phrasal verbs are removed . Hence , the phrasal verbs are transitive . The phrasal verbs in these examples also reject switching within the components of the phrasal verbs . However , they may allow Yorùbá words to come in - between them . In this sense , we cannot tag them as embedded language ( EL ) like their intransitive coun - terparts . Here are examples ; they have the respective translations in ( 3 ) above . 4a . W ọ́ n switch iná sitting room on . b . A set committee tuntun up . c . A ti call strike y ẹ n off . d . Ó f ẹ́ find nǹkan ti wọ́n ń plan out . e . Òun l ’ ó bring à w ọ n boys y ẹ n over . Again , as the examples from both types of phrasal verbs show , switching is permitted within the sentences containing the multi - word , but the phrasal verbs are not switched into Yorùbá , as exemplified below : 5a . * W ọ́ n yí on iná sitting room . b . * A set òkè committee tuntun . c . * A ti pè off strike y ẹ n . d . * Ó f ẹ́ find ìta nǹkan ti wọ́n ń plan . e . * Òun l ’ ó mú over àw ọ n boys y ẹ n MT Lamidi : The Syntax of Multi - Word Expressions in Yorulish Code - Mixing _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 40 Examples ( 5a - e ) demonstrate that switching is barred for this class of phrasal verbs . The question is : what is the nature of switching in these constructions ? Consider the following additional examples with variations in switch patterns : 6a . Olú give up ‘Olu gave up . ’ b . * Olú give òkè c . * Olú fún up 7a . Ṣadé give in ‘Sade gave in . ’ b . * Ṣ ad é give in ú c . * Ṣ ad é fún in 8a . Àw ọ n terrorists blow up motor y ẹ n . b . Àw ọ n terrorists blow motor y ẹ n up . ‘The terrorists blew up the vehicle . ’ c . * Àw ọ n terrorist f ọ́ motor y ẹ n up . d . * Àw ọ n terrorists blow motor y ẹ n sókè . In these sentences , the components of the phrasal verbs are switched either into Yorùbá or English ( 6b & c , 7b & c , 8c & d ) . While the first item is switched into Yorùbá in ( 6 & 7c ) the second word is switched into Yorùbá in ( 6 & 7b ) . The position is reversed for ( 8c & d ) , respectively . In all cases , the result is ungrammatical and unacceptable . Nevertheless , there are some good cases , which confirms that individual heads also determine the grammaticality and acceptability of the code - switched expressions : 9a . Ó ń act fún president ‘He’s acting for the president . ’ b . W ọ́ n adhere to / abide by the rule c . W ọ́ n adhere sí / abide p ẹ̀ lú rule y ẹ n ‘They abided by / adhered to that rule . ’ In these examples , act for becomes act fún , adhere to / adhere by becomes adhere sí / abide p ẹ̀ lú . Instances of these are not many in our data . Hence , within phrasal verbs , switching components of the multi - word verbs into Yorùbá is usually disallowed as evidenced in the bad cases . The first reason given above is about the head determining what comes after it . This is a syntactic reason . The second possible reason , a semantic reason , is that the multi - word is a unified phrase Ghana Journal of Linguistics 6 . 2 : 30 - 55 ( 2017 ) 41 with a recurrent meaning . If switching is allowed in any of its components , the meaning may be lost or distorted . This is a confirmation that the phrasal verb is a form of idiom , as widely observed in the literature . 6 . Prepositional verbs Prepositional verbs contain a verb and a preposition ; hence the name ‘preposi - tional verbs’ . However , if we follow van Gelderen’s ( 2010 ) ideas , the preposition may be seen as a particle . Either way , it does not affect the analysis here ; hence ‘preposition’ is adopted . In the following examples , there are different patterns regarding switching . 6 . 1 Prepositional verbs that reject switching In this type of structure , switching is barred within components of a preposi - tional verb , though other constituents within the sentence in which the prepositional verb occurs may be switched . Consider the following ; the prepositional verbs are typed in bold : 10a . Adé look after bàbá ẹ̀ . Ade looked after father his ‘Ade looked after his father . ’ b . * Adé wo after bàbá ẹ̀ c . * Adé look l ẹ́ yìn bàbá ẹ̀ 11a . Excitement wo ̣n ti die down Excitement their ASP die down ‘Their excitement has died down . ’ 12 . a . * Excitement wo ̣n ti kú down b . * Excitement wo ̣n ti die sílè ̣ c . * Excitement wo ̣n ti kú sílè ̣ 13a . Wó ̣n put off decision wo ̣n They put off decision their ‘They put off their decision . ’ b . * Wó ̣n gbé decision wo ̣n off c . * Wó ̣n put decision wo ̣n kúrò MT Lamidi : The Syntax of Multi - Word Expressions in Yorulish Code - Mixing _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 42 14a . Wó ̣n stand up nígbà t’ó dé They stand up when that : he arrive ‘They stood up when he arrived . ’ b . * Wó ̣n stand dúró nígbà tó arrive / when he arrived c . * Wó ̣n dìde up nígbà tó arrive / when he arrived d . Wó ̣n dìde dúró when he arrived / nígbà tó arrive 15a . Discussion go on fún ìgbà pípe ̣ ́ Discussion go on for time late ‘The discussion went on for a long time . ’ b . * Discussion lọ on fún ìgbà pípé ̣ c . * Discussion went s ̣íwájú for a long time In these examples , the first word in each prepositional verb is the head . The switching of either part of the prepositional verb is not allowed , as the starred ( b & c ) examples in all the examples show . Note , however , that in ( 14d ) , both components of the prepositional verbs are switched into Yorùbá . This is possible because the two words collocate in Yorùbá but a Yorùbá word and an English word that jointly form a prepositional verb may not collocate . 6 . 2 Preposition deletion pattern Another pattern is that in which the English preposition is elided in the code - switched grammar , leaving only the lexical verb . Notice also that this elision does not affect the original meaning of the multi - word verb . This is another method of avoiding ungrammaticality in the code - switched grammar . Consider the example below . 16a . Ó approve of your behaviour 3sg approve of your behaviour ‘S / he approves of your behaviour . ’ b . Ó approve – behav ̣iour e ̣ c . Ó approve ( ? of ) behaviour e ̣ In this example , the second part of the prepositional verb ( of ) occurs in ( 16a ) in what Myers - Scotton ( 1993b ) calls embedded language ( EL ) ( a structure that is wholly of a particular substrate in a code - switched language and thus maintaining the rules of that language only ) . It is deleted in ( 16b ) , following the rules of the matrix language ( in this case , Yorùbá ) . In ( 16c ) , however , the structure is of doubtful acceptability . Further data may be required to establish its status . Ghana Journal of Linguistics 6 . 2 : 30 - 55 ( 2017 ) 43 6 . 3 Prepositional verbs that permit switching The third pattern is that in which the preposition is switched from English into Yorùbá . Again , the original meaning of the multi - word prepositional verb is not af - fected . This is exemplified in ( 17 - 22 ) . 17a . Principal call fún water ‘The principal called for water . ’ b . * Principal call for omi c . Heavy smoking ń lead to / sí cancer ‘Heavy smoking leads to cancer . ’ 18a . Ó blame accident y ẹ n on the driver ( embedded language ) ‘She / He blamed the accident on the driver . ’ b . Ó blame accident y ẹ n l ’ órí driver . 19a . Ó lè order drink fún mi ‘He / she can order a drink for me . ’ b . Ó lè order drink for me ( embedded language ) 20a . Ó explain fún mi ‘He / She explained to me . ’ b . Ó explain to me ( embedded language ) 21a . Ó forgive mi fún rude remarks mi ‘He / She forgave me for my rude remarks’ b . Ó dárí jì mí for my rude remarks ( embedded language ) 22a . Ó congratulate ẹ̀ fún convocation ẹ̀ ‘She / he congratulated him / her on his / her convocation’ b . W ọ́ n abide p ẹ̀ lú terms wa ‘They abided with our terms’ c . Ó refer s í article y ẹ n ‘He / she referred to that article . ’ In these examples , the prepositional verbs are call for , lead to , blame on , order [ something ] for , explain to , forgive for and congratulate on . These are switched re - spectively , to call fún , lead sí , blame lórí , order fún , explain fún , forgive fún and MT Lamidi : The Syntax of Multi - Word Expressions in Yorulish Code - Mixing _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 44 congratulate fún . The possibility of switching here ensued from the fact that the lexical verbs have the major meaning while the preposition is merely playing a supportive role by just linking the verb to the NP that serves as the complement . Again , switches are allowed only on the second element of the prepositional verbs without any negative repercussion . However , when the second element of the MWE is in English , an embed - ded language must be formed with this second element as in ( 18a , 19b , 20b , 21b ) to avoid ungrammaticality . Finally , the structure is grammatical if the prepositional verb occurs with a switch ( as in 17a , 18b , 20a , 21a & 22 ) , with an intervening element ( 18 , 19 , 21 & 22a ) and along with embedded language ( 18a , 19b , 20b & 21b ) , which are all good cases . 7 . Phrasal - Prepositional Verbs These are verbs followed by two particles : an adverb and a preposition ( in that order ) . Just like what obtains under prepositional verbs , some prepositional phrasal verbs allow switching of their components , but some do not as in the following exam - ples : 23a . W ọ́ n ń look down on àw ọ n neighbours w ọ n They CONT look down on PL neighbours their ‘They are looking down on their neighbours / They look down on their neigh - bours . ’ b . O walk out on me ! ‘You walked out on me ! ’ There is also a pattern where switching is allowed . However , only the last compo - nent of the MWE can be switched . 24a . W ọ́ n put ẹ̀ up fún eviction . They put 3sg up for eviction ‘They put her / him up for eviction . ’ b . Ó put problem y ẹ n down sí inexperience . 3sg put problem that down to inexperience ‘She / He put the problem down to inexperience . ’ c . Mi ò lè put up p ẹ̀ lú ẹ̀ m ọ́ . I NEG can put up with 3sg again ‘I can’t put up with her / him / it any longer . ’ Ghana Journal of Linguistics 6 . 2 : 30 - 55 ( 2017 ) 45 d . Biola come up p ẹ̀ lú new ideas / theory tuntun . Biola come up with new ideas / theory new ‘Biola came up with new ideas / a new theory . ’ In comparison with what happened in the discussion on prepositional verbs , the preposition is observed to be the only item that switches to Yorùbá wherever switching is permitted . This means that the lexical verb and the adverbial particle are not switched . Again , while some phrasal - prepositional verbs allow switching , some do not . This im - plies that there are different levels of non - compositionality among the MWEs . The more compositional an expression is , the more it permits switches ; the less composi - tional it is , the less it permits switching . 8 . Splitting Verbs Splitting verbs are contributed to the code - switched structure by the Yorùbá substrate . They refer to verbs that have two parts each of which cannot occur inde - pendently and be meaningful . Hence , they normally co - occur either as a combined word or as splits in a sentence . According to Awobuluyi ( 1978 : 53 ) , “when used with an object , each verb in this class is always split into two halves , and their object is inserted between them . . . Many of them have idiomatic meanings . ” Examples include bàj ẹ́ ‘spoil’ , gbàgb ọ́ ‘believe’ and túká ‘disperse . ’ When they occur together as a word , splitting verbs can be switched wholly into English as in the following examples : 25a . Computer yìí ti bàj ẹ́ / crash ‘This computer has got spoilt / crashed’ b . À w ọ n students ti túká / disperse ‘Students have dispersed’ c . Ó gbàgb ọ́ / believe pé man y ẹ n try ‘She / He believed that that man tried . ’ However , when they are split , neither part of a splitting verb may be switched into English , but rather English nouns / words can come in between them .

Hence , ‘ - ’ is often used instead in some cases . In other cases , meaning that approxi - mates to each half of the splitting verb is presented . The first part of the splitting verb seems to have some sort of meaning which approximates partially to the intended mean - ing . Throughout these examples , we can see that the splitting verbs are impervious to switching . However , splitting verbs generally allow English words to come in - between them as demonstrated in all the examples presented above . So , what accounts for the ungrammaticality of the other examples ? The major reason for the unacceptability of switching is that each part of the splitting verb is mean - ingless without the other part . Although each of the parts may be meaningful in some contexts as an individual word , such meanings may not be sustainable when the words are switched into English . This explains why certain halves of the splitting verbs are translatable while the other parts are not . We conclude , therefore , that splitting verbs maintain their identity in code - mixed structures . Switches of either part of the splitting verb may render the expres - sions ungrammatical and unacceptable . 9 . Serial Verb Constructions Serial verb constructions ( SVCs ) are a series of two or more verb roots that co - occur but are not compounded in a sentence ( Payne , 1997 : 307 ) . However , the tense is often reflected on the first verb ( Lawal , 1989 ; Collins , 1997 ) . The Yorùbá part of the code - switched grammar contributes the SVC structure and English words are switched with them . Again , this confirms the Yorùbá substrate as the host language . Here are some examples : ( 41 - 46 ) are borrowed from Lamidi , ( 2003 ) : 41 . Mo f ẹ́ l ọ pray . I want go pray ‘I want to go and pray . ’ Ghana Journal of Linguistics 6 . 2 : 30 - 55 ( 2017 ) 49 42 . Kí ni o fi register ? What you use register ‘ What did you use to register ? ’ 43 . Mo fe ̣ ̣́ record è ̣ . I want record it ‘ I want to record it . ’ 44 . Òjó grumble wá síbí . Òjó grumble come here ‘Òjó grumbled as he came here . ’ 45 . O se rice j ẹ . You cook : pst rice eat : pst ‘You cooked rice and ate it . ’ 46 . Ṣo ̣ ́ ja ̀ plan coup dáràn . Soldier plan coup get : into : trouble ‘A soldier planned a coup and got into trouble . ’ We can subject these examples to different switch patterns and see how the SVCs behave . 47a . * Mo f ẹ́ go pray . b . * Mo like l ọ pray . c . * Kí ni o use register ? d . * Mo like record ( V ) ẹ́ . e . * Òjó grumble come síbí ( Lamidi , 2003 : 315 ) From the good examples , we can see that switches are permitted among com - ponents of SVC . From ( 41 - 43 ) , the first word in the SVC is in Yorùbá , while the sec - ond / third word is in English . In ( 44 & 46 ) the second word of the SVC is Yorùbá ; and in ( 45 ) , the SVC is purely in Yorùbá . However , in the bad examples ( 47a - e ) , it is shown that it is not every component of the SVC that can be switched ; the switches are peculiar to each SVC structure . The ungrammaticality shows that those components of the SVCs MT Lamidi : The Syntax of Multi - Word Expressions in Yorulish Code - Mixing _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 50 that were switched made the structures ill - formed . Most especially , all the components of the SVC may not be switched ( as in 47c - e ) . 10 . Idioms An idiom is a combination of words with a figurative meaning . Idiomatic ex - pressions can be words , phrases , clauses or sentences . Idioms have a unique meaning , which cannot be pieced together ( following the concept of compositionality ) from the meaning of individual words in an expression . Rather , the expression has only one uni - fied meaning . In English and Yorùbá ( as well as other natural languages ) , idioms and metaphors have a unified meaning that cannot be deduced from the surface structure of individual words . Consider the following code - switched examples : 48a . He kicked the bucket . ‘He died . ’ b . Ó kick bucket náà ( literal translation results : He kicked the bucket . ’ ) c . Ó ta bucket nípàá ‘He kicked a ( particular ) bucket . ’ 49a . He is pulling your leg ‘He is joking with you . ’ b . Ó ń pull leg / ẹ s ẹ̀ ẹ ( literal translation : He’s pulling your leg . ) 50a . Lead a dog’s life ‘live an unhappy life . ’ b . Eat humble pie ‘show remorse . ’ c . Throw in the towel ‘surrender . ’ These idioms are of English language origin . As they are , they may permit switching ( as in 49b ) , but at the cost of the intended meaning . In ( 48b & c ) , the meanings of the expressions are literal . Both expressions refer to a particular bucket that an indi - vidual kicked or a leg that is pulled . This is different from the intended meaning of someone’s death ( 48a ) and joking ( 49a ) . Hence , English idioms do not allow switching , if they must maintain their meaning . Consider the following Yorùbá idioms . 51a . Ó ta téru nípàá ‘He died’ b . * Ó kick téru 3sg kick white - cloth Ghana Journal of Linguistics 6 . 2 : 30 - 55 ( 2017 ) 51 52a . Gbogbo attempts y ẹ n fi orí ṣ ánp ọ́ n All attempts that use head - ‘All the attempts failed . ’ b . * Gbogbo attempts y ẹ n fi head ṣ ánp ọ́ n 53a . Àw ọ n workers y ẹ leader w ọ n n í sáà / * period Pl workers dislodge leader them at period ‘Workers disgraced / lowered the status of their leader . ’ b . * Àw ọ n workers remove leader w ọ n from sáà . In these examples , the idioms of Yorùbá origin resist switching . Apart from the fact that switching makes the expression unacceptable , it is not amenable to literal trans - lations . So , if any word is changed , the meaning of the expression collapses . 11 . Conclusions Having gone through the analyses of different MWEs , we have come to the following conclusions . Switching in MWEs is effected through scopal authority and semantic selection . In scopal authority , the heads subcategorise the particles ( if re - quired ) , determine the kind of particles / words that should follow them and the possi - bility of switching them to the other language ( as we find in 5 and other sections ) . The first word in a MWE serves as the head which determines whether the next or subse - quent word will be switched . Semantic selection determines the logical form or mean - ing of an expression before and after switching . When switches occur , the meaning may become literal ( as in idioms ) or remain intact ( as in other cases ) . Two patterns of switching are found in Yorulish MWEs : ( a ) Total rejection of switching and ( b ) partial rejection of switching . While splitting verbs and idioms ( es - pecially from Yorùbá ) ( sections 8 & 10 ) totally reject switching of their components into the other substrate language , phrasal verbs ( section 5 ) , prepositional verbs ( section 6 ) , phrasal - prepositional verbs ( section 7 ) and serial verbs ( section 9 ) allow switching in some cases but reject it in others . This means that there is a hierarchy , starting from the most impervious to the least impervious to switching . The reason for the rejection of switching can be traced to the non - compositional nature of the expressions that reject switching and the flexi - bility in the composition of those expressions that partially tolerate switching . Hence , we can observe levels of compositionality between two opposites . Those that are im - pervious to switching are non - compositional , while those that allow mixing are partially MT Lamidi : The Syntax of Multi - Word Expressions in Yorulish Code - Mixing _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 52 compositional , mixing / switching being more difficult as expressions become more non - compositional . Finally , although both English and Yorùbá are similar in their sentence typology ( they have Subject Verb Object word order ) , the order of words in each code - mixed structure usually conforms to the pattern in Yorùbá ( as discussed in section 5 . 1 ) . In the few cases where they do not conform , they are embedded language . This confirms that Yorùbá is the matrix language in Yorulish .
