We used a recombinant Fn - binding integrin , all & , to define rules for integrin - initiated Fn matrix forma - tion . We report the following . First , multiple Fn - binding integrins can support matrix assembly ; their activation state controls fibrillogenesis . Second , Fn binding to cells expressing an activated integrin is nec - essary but not sufficient for matrix assembly . Addi - tional “postoccupancy”events involving the integrin p , but not the a subunit , cytoplasmic domain are needed . Third , these postoccupancy events require an intact actin cytoskeleton . We propose a model for integrin involvement in Fn fibrillogenesis that reconciles previ - ous paradoxes and suggests novel approaches to the therapeutic control of Fn matrix assembly . Introduction Fibronectin ( Fn ) is a glycoprotein indispensable for verte - brate embryogenesis ( George et al . , 1993 ) . Fn exists both in a soluble form ( plasma concentration - 1 PM ) and as an insoluble matrix . Fn matrices are deposited in a temporally and spatially defined pattern utilizing both newly synthe - sized cellular Fn and soluble Fn ( Mosher et al . , 1992 ) . Cells use these Fn matrices as migratory tracks during development ( Boucaut et al . , 1990 ) . More importantly , the Fn matrix is imprinted with positional information that con - tributes to the directional migration of mesoderm ( Boucaut et al . , 1990 ; Winklbauer and Nagel , 1991 ) . This positional information may be important for preservation of the left - right asymmetry ( Yost , 1992 ) of the embryo . Cell migration along Fn matrices is also involved in wound healing ( Clark and Colvin , 1985 ) . Furthermore , loss of capacity to form an Fn matrix is a feature of the transformed phenotype ( Hynes et al . , 1978 ) ; restoration of matrix assembly corre - lates with reduced malignant behavior ( Giancotti and Ru - oslahti , 1990 ) . Thus , the generation of Fn matrices is vital in vertebrate development and response to injury , and its disruption may contribute to tumorigenesis . Fn matrix assembly often depends on Fn binding to integrins , ubiquitous heterodimeric adhesion receptors ( Hynes , 1992 ) . Fn fragments containing the a & - binding domain or antibodies against that domain ( McDonald et al . , 1987 ) or against a & itself ( Fogerty et al . , 1990 ; Aki - yama et al . , 1989 ) block Fn matrix assembly in vitro . Chi - nese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells lacking asPI assemble a matrix only after reconstitution of the integrin by transfec - tion ( Wu et al . , 1993 ) . To date , the only integrin implicated in Fn fibrillogenesis is a & . Nevertheless , in the absence of a & , certain mesodermal structures form and cells can assemble a matrix ( Yang et al . , 1993 ) , suggesting that other integrin or nonintegrin receptors can substitute for ad % . The role of integrins in matrix assembly is not com - pletely understood . Fn binds to layers of substrate - at - tached , matrix - forming cells in part via the N - terminal 70 kDa domain of Fn ( 70K ) ( McKeown - Longo and Mosher , 1983 , 1985 ) . The 70K fragment blocks matrix assembly ( McDonald et al . , 1987 ; Quade and McDonald , 1988 ) , but is not known to interact directly with a & . Fragments of Fn that lack known integrin - binding sites can be incorporated into an existing Fn matrix ( Schwarzbauer , 1991 ; Sottile and Wiley , 1994 ) . Similarly , the first type Ill repeat in Fn ( Ill - l ) does not interact with a & , but seems to play a role in this process ( Morla and Ruoslahti , 1992 ; Mosher et al . , 1992 ; Chernousov et al . , 1991 ; Hocking et al . , 1994 ; Aguirre et al . , 1994 ) . Furthermore , the expression of inte - grin a & is not sufficient to enable a cell to assemble an Fn matrix . For example , certain tumor cells show no reduc - tion in expression of this integrin ( Akiyama et al . , 1990 ; Dedhar and Saulnier , 1990 ) . One explanation for these apparent paradoxes is that there might exist a distinct cell surface matrix assembly receptor that binds to the 70K N - terminal region of Fn ( McKeown - Longo and Mosher , 1985 ) . The ligand binding affinity of many integrins is regulated by cellular signaling events . In particular , a & can exist in high ( operationally defined as activated ) or low affinity states with respect to Fn binding ( Faull et al . , 1993 ) . A number of cell lines express only low affinity a & ( Faull et al . , 1993 ) . These cells do not assemble an Fn matrix in vitro ( R . Faull and M . H . G . , unpublished data ) . Further - more , in the presence of physiological concentrations of soluble Fn , high affinity a $ , is saturated with ligand and thus cannot mediate cell adhesion ( Faull et al . , 1993 ) . Fi - nally , overexpression of isolated integrin fl cytoplasmic domains disrupts the high affinity state of integrins ( Chen et al . , 1994 ) and blocks matrix assembly ( LaFlamme et al . , 1994 ) . Thus , the activation state of Fn - binding inte - grins , such as a & , may regulate fibrillogenesis . all & z ( platelet GPllb - llla ) is the most abundant platelet integrin and is a prototype for analysis of changes in inte - grin affinity . aI & becomes activated when platelets spread ( Loftus and Albrecht , 1984 ) and form Fn fibrils ( Hynes et al . , 1978 ) . Because all & is an Fn - binding inte - grin ( Ginsberg et al . , 1983 ; Gardner and Hynes , 1985 ; Parise and Phillips , 1986 ) , it could enable platelets to as - semble an Fn matrix . Activation state can be precisely Cell 716 controlled in recombinant all & by three distinct mecha - nisms . First , chimeras composed of the cytoplasmic do - mains of various a and f3 subunits joined to the transmem - brane and extracellular domains of alI & can be activated via energy - dependent , cell type - specific cellular machin - ery ( O’Toole et al . , 1994 ) . Second , elimination of the con - served membrane - proximal GFFKR motif in the a subunit cytoplasmic domain ( Figure 1 ) activates aII & . These dele - tion mutantsdo not utilize thecellular machinery employed by the chimeras ; hence , they have been termed hinge mutants to emphasize this distinction ( 07oole et al . , 1994 ) . Third , certain monoclonal antibodies , e . g . , anti - LlSS6 ( Frelinger et al . , 1991 ) , bind directly to aI & and activate it independent of cellular context . To test the hy - pothesis that the activation state of Fn - binding integrins regulates fibrillogenesis , we examined the capacity of re - combinant ajIbS to assemble an Fn matrix in CHO cells . Our results demonstrate that two distinct features of a Fn - binding integrin are essential elements in assembly of a Fn matrix . These are activation of the integrin to bind Fn with high affinity and postreceptor occupancy events that require an intact b subunit cytoplasmic domain . To - gether , these results define a testable model of the essen - tial and initial steps in Fn matrix assembly and document the importance of its control via modulation of the func - tional state of integrins . “5 - - Pt - aLA ( b”GFFK ) - - - - - - - Figure 1 .

To assess the capacity of these domains to control assembly of the Fn matrix , we used CHO cells expressing recombinant al & , an Fn - binding integrin whose functional state is readily assessed . Because these cells can utilize endogenous a & to form an Fn matrix , we added saturating quantities of an anti - as antibody , PBl ( Brown and Juliano , 1985 , 1988 ) . Under these conditions , the a & , - expressing CHO cells did not form Fn fibrils ( Fig - ure 2A ) . The same cells assembled an Fn matrix in the presence or absence of the allb6S - blQCking antibody 2G12 ( Figure 2B ) , indicating that the cells could form Fn fibrils‘ using endogenous hamster a & .

CHO cells ^ ’ that expressed this chimera assembled an Fn matrix in the presence of an a & - blocking antibody ( Figure 2D ) . Moreover , a combination of both aII & - and a & - blocking antibodies was required to ablate Fn matrix assembly by these cells ( Figure 2F ) ; either antibody alone failed to do so . The ability of the chimeric * allba & j & integrin to support matrix assembly was not attributable to enhanced biosyn - thesis of endogenous a & , as expression levels were simi - lar to those in the a , , & - transfected cells ( Figure 2G ) . Thus , replacing the cytoplasmic domains of all & integrin with those of a & integrin enabled alI & to support Fn matrix assembly . Fn Matrix Assembly Depends on lntegrin Activation The * allba & ( jl chimera differs from alI & in its ligand bind - ingaffinityinCHOcells ( 07ooleetal . , 1994 ) . Todetermine whether activation is vital for initiation of Fn matrix assem - bly , we employed a mutation that enhances ligand binding affinity through a mechanism different from that of the * allba & & chimera . The * allbaLA chimera ( see Figure 1 ) was expressed with 83 in as - deficient CHO 82 cells . In the * allbaLA chimera , the conserved VGFFK sequence is deleted ( see Figure 1 ) . When l allbaLA is expressed with f & , the resulting integrin exhibits high affinity ligand bind - ing that is independent of cellular signaling machinery ( 07oole et al . , 1994 ) . Consistent with their deficiency of endogenous a & ( Schreiner et al . , 1989 ; Wu et al . , 1993 ) , CHO 82 cells expressing wild - type a , , & integrin did not assemble an Fn matrix ( Figure 3A ) . In contrast , CHO 82 cells expressing similar levels ( Figure 3E ) of * allbaLAps did so ( Figure 3B ) . Matrix assembly by these cells depended on the al & extracellular domain , since it was inhibited by the all & - blOCkirIg antibody 2G12 ( Figure 3C ) or the all & specific inhibitor R044 - 9883 ( data not shown ) . Iden - tical results were obtained when CHO Kl cells expressing the same * C & C & & chimera were tested in the presence of the a & blocking antibody PBl ( data not shown ) .

The numbers in parentheses represent the geometric mean fluorescence intensities . activation of alI & via a hinge mutation enables allb & to support Fn matrix assembly . The aI & integrin can be activated and maintained in a high affinity binding state by certain antibodies , such as anti - LIBSG ( Frelingeretal . , 1991 ) . Weutilizedthisantibody as a third approach to examine the relationship between high affinity state and Fn matrix assembly . CHO cells ex - lntegrins and Matrix Assembly 719 also participate in matrix assembly by cells expressing activated a & , we utilized an antibody against the cell - binding domain of Fn ( N294 ) and the 70 kDa N - terminal fragment of Fn ( McDonald et al . , 1987 ) . Both reagents blocked Fn matrix formation ( Figures 5A and 5C ) by alI $ J . transfected CHO B2 cells cultured in the presence of anti - LIBSG antibody . The inhibition was specific , as neither an irrelevant mouse immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) ( Figure 58 ) nor a 60 kDa gelatin - binding Fn fragment that lacks the N - ter - minus had any effect ( Figure 5D ) . The N294 antibody and the 70 kDa fragment also inhibited Fn matrix assembly mediated by the constitutively active l allbaLAp3 chimeric integrin ( data not shown ) . Thus , both the cell - binding and N - terminal domains of Fn are involved in matrix assembly mediated by activated alI & and a & , consistent with a common mechanism supported by both integrins . The Fn matrix deposited by cells expressing a & is typi - cally stabilized by disulfide bonds ( Keski - Oja , 1976 ; Ali and Hynes , 1978 ) and resists solubilization in sodium deoxycholate ( McKeown - Longo and Mosher , 1983 ) . To determine whether the Fn matrix assembled by cells ex - pressing activated alI & integrin shares these characteris - tics , we cultured CHO Kl cells expressing the constitu - tively active * allbaLAp3 chimera , as well as control CHO A5 cells expressing inactive wild - type aI & integrin , with ‘z51 - labeled Fn . The anti - a & antibody PBl was included in the culture media to block endogenous a & activity . After 48 hr , the cell layer was extracted with 2 % deoxycho - late , and the deoxycholate insoluble matrix fraction was dissolved in SDS and analyzed by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) under nonreducing and reducing conditions . The l allbaLAP3 chimera ( Figure 5E , lane a ) , but not the wild - type alI & integrin ( lane b ) , caused formation of high molecular weight detergent - insoluble complexes containing 1Z51 - labeled Fn . The formation of these complexes was inhibited by the a & - specific inhibi - tor R044 - 9883 ( Figure 5E , lane c ) , confirming that alI & integrin participated in the assembly process . Disulfide bonds stabilized the multimeric Fn complexes , as mono - meric Fn subunits were released from the complex in the presence of dithiothreitol ( Figure 5E , lane e ) . Some of the complexes resisted reduction . The nature of the bond ( s ) cross - linking Fn in these complexes is unknown , but could be & - ( y - glutamyl ) lysyl bond ( s ) catalyzed by transglutami - nase ( Barry and Mosher , 1989 ) . Thus , based on morphol - ogy , utilization of sites in Fn , and disulfide stabilization , the matrix induced by aI & closely resembles that assem - bled by a & . Fn Binding to Cells Expressing an Activated lntegrin Is Not Sufficient for Fn Matrix Assembly The experiments described above demonstrated that acti - vation , normally regulated by integrin cytoplasmic do - of ‘251 - labeled human plasma Fn . In lanes a - d , samples were prepared in nonreducing SDS - PAGE sample buffer ( 2 % SDS , 62 . 5 mM Tris [ pH 6 . 81 ) . In lanes e - h , samples were prepared in the same buffer containing 100 mM dithiothreitol . mains , controls integrin - mediated Fn matrixassembly . We next sought to evaluate the roles of the cytoplasmic do - mains apart from their capacity to regulate affinity . To do this , we used either anti - LIBSG ( 07oole et al . , 1991 ) or hinge mutants ( O’Toole et al . , 1994 ) whose high affinity state is independent of distal sequences in the a and B cytoplasmic domains . Cells expressing allbA996 ( 33 ( see Figure l ) , in which the allb cytoplasmic domain is nearly completely truncated , formed Fn fibrils in the presence of anti - LIBSG ( Figure 6B ) . This result suggests that the distal a cytoplasmic domain is not required for matrix assembly once an integrin is activated . Strikingly different results were obtained with cells expressing p cytoplasmic domain truncation mutants depicted in Figure 1 . The B cytoplasmic domain truncation mutant ail & A728 ( Kd = 72 nM ) bound Fn with similar affinity to aII & ( Kd = 76 nM ) when activated by anti - LIBSG in suspension ( Figure 6F ) . However , adher - ent CHO cells expressing this integrin did not assemble an Fn matrix ( Figure 6D ) . CHO cells expressing the activated ( O’Toole et al . , 1994 ) variant * anba & f13A724 , in which the I3 cytoplasmic domain was truncated and the VGFFK se - quence was deleted from the a cytoplasmic domain , were also incapable of assembling an Fn matrix ( Figure 6E ) . Thus , some function ( s ) of the p cytoplasmic domain , in addition to inside - out signaling , is required to support Fn matrix assembly . One important function of the p cytoplasmic domain is interaction with the actin cytoskeleton ( Solowska et al . , 1989 ; Hayashi et al . , 1990 ) . Consequently , [ 3 cytoplasmic domain truncation could block assembly by preventing the interaction of the ligand - occupied integrin with the cy - toskeleton . To investigate this further , we added cytocha - lasin D to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton of cells expressing activated a & . Fn matrix assembly mediated by anti - LIBSG - activated allbps was abolished by cytochalasin D ( Figures 7A and 7B ) , whereas Fn binding to suspended cells was completely unaffected ( Table 1 ) . Removal of cy - tochalasin D from the cells restored their ability to assem - ble an Fn matrix ( data not shown ) . Thus , Fn binding to an activated integrin is necessary but not sufficient for an integrin to support Fn matrix assembly . Discussion Our results provide several insights into the mechanism of formation of Fn fibrils . First , multiple Fn - binding inte - grins can support Fn matrix assembly . Second , integrin activation state regulates fibrillogenesis . Third , Fn binding to cells expressing an activated integrin is necessary but not sufficient for matrix assembly . Additional postoccu - panty events involving the p , but not the a subunit cyto - plasmic domain are required . Fourth , these postoccu - panty events require an intact actin cytoskeleton . Based on these data , we propose a model for integrin involve - ment in Fn fibrillogenesis , an event of importance in devel - opment , wound healing , and malignant transformation . This model reconciles previous paradoxical results and suggests novel approaches to the therapeutic control of Fn matrix assembly .

The scale bar in ( A ) is 50 urn and applies to both panels . The high affinity form of several Fn - binding integrins can initiate Fn matrix assembly . In cells in which a & was either blocked or absent , aI & could support assembly of Fn fibrils . Activation induced by two mechanistically dis - tinct cytoplasmic domain mutations or by an activating monoclonal antibody was a prerequisite for a & to sup - port fibrillogenesis . The matrices formed under control of al & and a & were indistinguishable basedon morpholog - ical appearance , Fn domains required , or appearance of disulfide bond - stabilized multimers . Matrix assembly is a precisely regulated process in vivo ( Critchley et al . , 1979 ) ; this regulation cannot solely be explained by changes in integrin expression repertoires ( J . Ramos and D . DeSi - mone , personal communication ) . Because changing inte - grin activation regulates matrix assembly , inside - out inte - grin signaling ( Ginsberg et al . , 1992 ) could modulate the assembly process . Our finding that Fn - binding integrins other than a $ en - able assembly of an Fn matrix suggests that such inte - grins , e . g . , a & ( Char0 et al . , 1990 ) could account for matrix assembly in a5 null mice . Indeed , we have observed that activated a & supports matrix assembly ( C . W . , un - published data ) . Both a & and alI & recognizesimilarsites in the adjacent ninth and tenth type Ill modules of Fn ( Bow - ditch et al . , 1994 ; Aota et al . , 1994 ) , while a & recognizes only the tenth module ( Bowditch et al . , 1994 ) .

After incubation in the presence or absence of 10 PM cytochalasin D , specifically bound Fn was determined as described in the Experimental Procedures . a Mean i : SEM of triplicate determinations . quently , an integrin capable of binding to the site in the ninth module is not absolutely required for assembly . In addition , a & integrin mediates Fn matrix assembly , albeit indirectly via binding of entactin , which apparently in turn binds Fn ( Wu et al . , 1995 ) . The identification of alternative integrins mediating Fn matrix assembly does not a priori exclude a & from a unique role in fibrillogenesis . a & is critical for normal development , although it is not clear whether its principal role is in Fn assembly , in recognition , or in providing unique intracellular signals ( Yang et al . , 1993 ) . In adult tissues , a & is not generally expressed in vivo , except at sitesof tissue injury and repair , concomitant with the appearance and recognition of Fn matrices . This suggests that a & may be indispensable for certain as - pects of matrix assembly and indicates that additional in vivo experiments are required to define its special role . Fn binding to cells expressing an activated integrin is not sufficient to support matrix assembly . Cytochalasin D or truncation of the p cytoplasmic domain disrupted Fn matrix formation , even though Fn bound to aI , & with a similar affinity . This finding establishes that events subse - quent to ligand binding are essential for fibril formation . The I3 cytoplasmic domain is required for integrin - cyto - skeleton associations ( Solowska et al . , 1989 ) , and cyto - chalasin D disrupts the actin cytoskeleton leading to a change in cell shape . Furthermore , Fn fibrils codistribute with actin - containing stress fibers ( Hynes and Destree , 1978 ; Roman et al . , 1989 ) . Consequently , it is likely that the postoccupancy events required for matrix assembly depend on the cytoskeleton . Lysophosphatidic acid rap - idly stimulates cytoskeletal organization ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) and the binding of the 70K fragment of Fn to cell layers ( Zhang et al . , 1994 ) . In contrast , anti - integrin anti - bodies require - 15 min to inhibit 70K binding ( Fogerty et al . , 1990 ) . Our results suggest that this 15 min delay is ascribable to the capacity of previously bound Fn to con - tinue to support the cytoskeleton - dependent postoccu - pancyevents . Thus , integrin participation in matrix assem - bly requires an activated Fn - binding integrin , the presence of a S cytoplasmic domain , and an intact cellular cyto - skeleton . The results presented here suggest a working model for the role of integrins in the generation of binding sites for the N - terminal 70K domain of Fn and subsequent fibril - logenesis ( Figure 8 ) . One essential step is the binding of Fn to an activated integrin , an event that is cell type spe - cific and subject to rapid and dynamic regulation ( 07oole et al . , 1994 ; Faull et al . , 1994 ) . An additional step involves the I3 subunit cytoplasmic domain and the actin cytoskele - ton . The first type Ill module of Fn ( Ill - l ) can bind to the 70K fragment ( Hocking et al . , 1994 ; Aguirre et al . , 1994 ) ; binding is enhanced by denaturation of the fragment ( Hocking et al . , 1994 ) . Moreover , peptides from Ill - 1 can either inhibit ( Morla and Ruoslahti , 1992 ) or promote ( Morla et al . , 1994 ) Fn fibrillogenesis . Thus , a change in Ill - 1 in - volving denaturation or partial unfolding of integrin - bound Fn could account for generation of 70K binding sites . Er - ickson ( 1994 ) has proposed that forces on the order of Figure 6 . The Integrin - Dependent Steps in Fn Matrix Assembly Initially , fibril formation requires activation of the integrin and high affinity Fn binding . Subsequently , postoccupancyevents involving the cytoskeleton and an intact p cytoplasmic domain expose an active assembly site that binds to the N - terminal region ( N - terminal matrix assembly domain as indicated by the open circles ) . As discussed in the text , Fn type III modules are a candidate for the active assembly site . The type Ill site could be activated via mechanochemical transduc - tion caused by reversible unfolding of the module in response to force generated in the cytoskeleton and transmitted through the integrin . Note that the model implies that the Fn molecule must be tethered to a second point as well as to the integrin . Because Fn is a dimer linked together at its C - terminus and the integrin binds to 111 - 10 , the second site of tethering could dictate which type Ill modules were placed under tension . For example if the second tethering sitewere at the N - terminus of the same subunit via interactions with collagen or another Fn mole - cule , then Ill - l to Ill - 9 would be stretched . If as , depicted , if the second tether was another integrin , then Ill - 11 to Ill - 15 would be stretched . Because unfolding would expose the hydrophobic core of the type III module , the most conserved region ( Leahy et al . , 1992 ; Main et al . , 1992 ) , it is possible that multiple unfolded repeats could function as active assembly sites . Present evidence suggests that this function is primarily performed by Ill - 1 ( Hocking et al . , 1994 ; Aguirre et al . , 1994 ; Morla and Ruoslahti , 1992 ; Chernousov et al . , 1991 ) . Cell 722 5 pN , which are readily achievable in vivo , are sufficient to reversibly unfold type Ill modules . The maintenance of cells under tension is required for Fn fibrillogenesis ( Halli - day and Tomasek , 1995 ) , and the 70K fragment binds preferentially to focal adhesions ( Dzamba et al . , 1994 ) , sites of traction between the cell and substratum . The abil - ity of integrins to transmit force to the extracellular matrix requires the presence of a 6 cytoplasmic domain ( Ylanne et al . , 1993 ) . Thus , the postoccupancy event required for exposure of the 70K binding site may involve force applied to Fnviathe connection of the integrin to the actin cytoskel - eton . Consequently , formation of stable connections be - tween the matrix and the cytoskeleton , the property that engendered the term integrin ( Tamkun et al . , 1986 ) , may be required for these receptors to support Fn fibrillo - genesis . In the time since this paper was submitted , Wennerberg et al . ( 1995 ) have provided additional evidence that ( j3 inte - grins can assemble an Fn matrix . These authors report that 6 , - deficient embryonic stem cells assembled an Fn matrix . Both av and p3 subunits colocalize with the Fn fibrils , suggesting that integrin a & is involved in assem - bling the matrix . Experimental Procedures Antibodies and Reagents The inhibitory anti - hamster c5 antibody PBl ( Brown and Juliano , 1985 , 1988 ) the activation - dependent anti - a , , & antibody PACl ( Shattil et al . , 1985 ) , andtheinhibitoryanti - a , , ~ ~ santibody2G12 ( Plowetal . , 1985 ; Woods etal . , 1984 ) were obtained from Drs . R . L . Juliano ( University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , NC ) , S . Shattil ( University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA ) , and V . L . Woods , Jr . ( University of California - San Diego , La Jolla , CA ) , respectively . The activating anti - a , , & antibody LIBSG , noninhibitory anti - a & antibodies D57 and Ab15 ( 07oole et al . , 1994 ) and the anti - Fn antibody N294 recognizing the RGD - containing cell - binding domain ( McDonald et al . , 1987 ) have been described previously . Purified mouse IgG and cytochalasin D were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company ( St . Louis , MO ) . Bo - vine and human plasma Fns , and the 70 kDa N - terminal fragment and 60 kDa gelatin - binding fragment of human plasma Fn , were prepared as previously described ( Quade and McDonald , 1988 ) . Fn labeled with ‘ ? was prepared using IODO - BEADS ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) ( Quade and McDonald , 1988 ) . The all & - specific peptidomimetic inhibitor R044 - 9883 ( Alig et al . , 1992 ) was provided by Dr . B . Steiner ( Hoff - mann - La Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) . cDNA Vectors , Transfection , and Cell Culture CHO Ki cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collec - tion ( Rockville , MD ) . The a & - deficient CHO 82 cell line ( Schreiner et al . , 1989 ) was provided by Dr . R . L . Juliano . CHO cellswere maintained in a - MEM medium ( GIBCO Laboratories , Grand Island , NY ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Atlanta Biologicals , Norcross , GA ) , 1 % antibiotic - antimycotic mixture ( SigmaChemical Company ) , and 2 mM glutamine . The generation of expression vectors in pCDM8 encoding the integrin subunits arIb , allbA996 , ( xv , all & A , a , , & 83 . 8 & , , 8 , A724 , and 8 , A728 has been described ( Loftus et al . , 1990 ; 07oole et al . , 1989 , 1990 , 1994 ) ( Figure 1 ) . AllcDNAconstructswereverified by DNA sequencing and purified by CsCl centrifugation before transfection into the specified CHO cell line ( Kl or 82 ) using lipofectamine reagent ( Bethesda Research Laboratories , Gaithersburg , MD ) as described in the protocols of the manufacturer , The cDNA constructs are depicted in Figure 1 . Constructs encoding activated , e . g . , high affinity ligand - binding integrins as reported ( OToole et al . , 1994 ) are indicated by an asterisk in Figure 1 and thereafter . Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Cell surface expression of wild - type alI & integrin and the a & mutants was analyzed using the anti - a , , & antibody D57 and an FITC - conjugated goat anti - mouse ( Tago , Burlingame , CA ) secondary anti - body on a FACScan ( Becton Dickinson lmmunocytometry Systems , Rutherford , NJ ) as described ( Loftus et al . , 1990 ; 07oole et al . , 1989 , 1990 , 1994 ) . Cell lines that stably expressvarious a & mutants ( Figure 1 ) were isolated by single cell sorting on a FACStar plus ( Becton Dickin - son lmmunocytometry Systems ) as described ( Loftus et al . , 1990 ) . Fn Matrix Assembly Assays QualitativeFn matrixassemblywas determined byimmunofluorescent staining of cell monolayers , using measures to minimize observer bias ( McDonald et al . , 1987 ) . Cells were suspended in a - MEM medium containing 10 % FBS depleted of Fn by gelatin affinity absorption and supplemented with purified bovine plasma Fn , antibodies , or other additives as specified . All reagents were dialyzed against three changes of 100 vol of a - MEM medium and filtered through a 0 . 2 pm filter before adding to culture medium . Cells were plated in Lab - Tek 8 - chamber culture slides ( Nunc , Incorporated , Naperville , IL ; 200 PI / well ) or 12 - well HTC slides ( Cel - Line , Incorporated , Newfield , NJ ; 50 nl / well ) at a final density of 2 . 5 x 1 O5 cells / ml and cultured in a 37OC incubator under a 5 % CO , , 95 % air atmosphere . Cells were fixed with 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde and stained with a rabbit anti - bovine plasma Fn antibody ( 32 wglml ) and Cy3 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG anti - bodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories . Incoroorated . West Grove , PA ; 7 . 5 rig / ml ) . Stained cell monolayers were observed using a Nikon FXA epifluorescence microscope . and reoresentative fields were photographed using KodakT - Max 40dor Ektachrome 16OOdirect positive slide film . To obtain representative images , exposure times for different experimental conditions were fixed , using the positive , i . e . , matrix - forming cells , as the index exposure length . All critical im - munostaining experiments were reviewed and coded independently by one observer ( J . A . M . ) without knowledge of the experimental conditions . Isolation and Biochemical Characterization of Extracellular Matrix Fn Cells were cultured in 35 mm tissue culture elates ( Cornina . Incoroo - rated , Corning , NY ) in a - MEM medium containing‘lO % Fn : depleted FBS , 123 nM ‘251 - labeled human plasma Fn ( 1 . 46 x 1 05comlnmoh . and \ - ~ , II other additives as specified . After seeding ( 2 days ) , the cell monolayers were washed twice with PBS and harvested with a cell scraper . The extracellular matrix fraction was isolated bv seauential extraction of I the cells with the following : first , 3 % Triton X - 100 in PBS containing 10 nM EDTA , 0 . 2 mM 4 - [ 2 - aminoethylj - benzenesulfonvl fluoride . 10 nM leupeptin , and 1 pM pepstatin ; second , 100 rig / ml DNase I in 50 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 4 ) IO mM MnCI * , 1 M NaCI ; third , 2 % deoxycholate in Tris ( pH 8 . 8 ) 10 mM EDTA , 0 . 2 mM 4 - [ 2 - aminoethylj - benzenesulfonyl fluoride , 10 nM leupeptin , and 1 pM pepstatin ( Wu et al . , 1993 ) . ‘ ? m labeled Fn in the deoxycholate - insoluble extracellular matrix fraction was analyzed by reducing and nonreducing SDS - PAGE ( 5 % stacking and 7 . 5 % running polyacrylamide gel ) and autoradiography . Fn Binding to Cells The binding of ‘251rlabeled Fn to CHO cells was quantified as described ( OToole et al . , 1990 ; Plow and Ginsberg . 1981 ) . and the ‘251 - labeled I . I . Fn binding results were analyzed using the LIGAND program ( Munson and Rodbard , 1980 ) . In brief , cells were harvested with EDTA and trypsin and resuspended in a modified Tyrode’s buffer ( 150 mM NaCI , 2 . 5 mM KCI , 2 mM NaHC03 , 2 mM MgClz , 2 mM CaC12 , 1 mglml BSA , and 1 mglml dextrose ) . Cells ( 0 . 2 ml of5 x 106cells / ml ) were incubated with ‘Z51 - labeled Fn for 30 min at 37OC . Aliquots ( 50 ~ 1 ) were layered on 0 . 3 ml of 20 % sucrose and centrifuged for 3 min at 12 , 000 rpm . ‘251 - labeled Fn associated with the cell pellet was determined by scintil - lation spectrometry .
