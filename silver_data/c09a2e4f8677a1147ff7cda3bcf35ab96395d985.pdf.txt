The latter can be further cleaved into an amino - terminal p37 domain and a carboxy - terminal p58 domain , which remain noncovalently linked . Secreted VacA is a flower - shaped oligomer , formed by six or seven monomers . After a short exposure to acidic or basic pH , the oligomer is disassembled and VacA becomes able to interact with lipid bilayers . Interaction with biological membranes triggers restoration of the oligomers to form anion - selective , voltage - dependent channels . 5 The membrane channel - forming ability of VacA resides in its aminoterminal portion , and single amino acid substitutions ( P9A and G14A ) in the p37 domain completely abrogate it . 6 , 7 Vacuolization of epithelial cells by VacA is strictly dependent on the formation of anion - selective membrane channels , which are targeted to late endosomes after internalization of the toxin . 3 , 5 , 8 , 9 Indeed , once bound to the cell surface , VacA is rapidly internalized by a pinocytic mechanism that involves F - actin but is independent of clathrin , dynamin , and of the ARF6 GTPase . It is then routed to early endosomes before reaching late endosomes . 10 , 11 H . pylori has been associated with increased level of apoptosis in human gastric mucosa . 12 - 15 It has been proposed that loss of specialized cells ( especially the gastric parietal cells ) resulted in alterations of crucial cellular crosstalk pathways , eventually leading to disturbed differentiation and to the initiation of the metaplasia / dysplasia / carcinoma sequence . 16 Although multiple H . pylori factors , including products of cag pathogenicity island 17 and lipopolysaccharide , 18 are likely to be involved , VacA is per se sufficient to induce cell death . 19 , 20 Apoptosis is a genetically controlled , evolutionarily conserved pathway in which intracellular organelles have a major regulatory role . Mitochondria , in particular , integrate and amplify diverse apoptotic signals by releasing into the cytosol ( Cyt ) cytochrome c and other cofactors required for the activation of the effector caspases , which then dismantle the cellular structures . The release of cytochrome c is controlled by BCL - 2 family members , which include both anti - and pro - apoptotic proteins . In a widely accepted model , the so - called ‘BH3 - only’ proapoptotic members of the family sense the damage signal and transmit it to the so - called ‘multidomain proapoptotics’ BAX and BAK , which are required for the activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis . Once activated by BH3 - only proteins , BAX and BAK provide a physical pathway for the efflux of cytochrome c from mitochondria . In addition , they dictate steady - state Ca 2 + levels in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , thus controlling the response to Ca 2 + - mediated death stimuli . 21 Apoptosis induced by VacA might follow the activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis , as suggested by the ability of VacA to lower mitochondrial membrane potential ( Δ Ψ m ) 22 and to release cytochrome c . 23 Accordingly , both a fusion protein between the N - terminal fragment of VacA ( p37 ) and GFP , and the purified toxin , localize to mitochondria . 24 Loss of Δ Ψ m and cytochrome c release require the channel - forming domain of VacA . 7 , 24 , 25 This led to the hypothesis that Δ Ψ m dissipation and / or cytochrome c release were a direct consequence of a VacA channel in the mitochondrial inner membrane , independently from host factors . 26 However , VacA activates the multidomain proapoptotic proteins BAX and BAK before the release of cytochrome c . 27 This complicates the picture and leaves us with a number of open questions : Is VacA targeted to mitochondria ? How ? Does it require BAX and BAK to kill ? Does it rely on adequate ER Ca 2 + levels or on the direct mitochondrial function of BAX and BAK ? In this study we used a genetic approach to investigate the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by VacA . VacA requires BAX and BAK at the mitochondrial level to kill . Unexpectedly , active VacA also induces the translocation of BAX to endosomes , in parallel with the co - Calore et al . Page 2 Cell Death Differ . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2011 March 4 . U KP M C F unde r s G r oup A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t U KP M C F unde r s G r ou p A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t segregation of endosomal and mitochondrial membranes . Co - segregation and cell death strictly depend on the channel - forming domain of the toxin and on the presence of BAX and BAK . Thus , the program of VacA - induced apoptosis includes an unexpected subroutine of BAX - and BAK - dependent endosomal juxtaposition to mitochondria , extending the known roles of these proapoptotic proteins . Results Apoptosis by VacA requires integrity of its channel - forming domain and BAX and BAK We evaluated whether apoptosis induced by H . pylori culture supernatant ( CS ) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) required the multidomain proapoptotics BAX and BAK . MEFs doubly deficient for Bax and Bak ( double knockout ( DKO ) ) 28 were resistant to apoptosis induced by the H . pylori supernatant when compared with their wild - type ( wt ) counterparts ( Figures 1a and b ) . We then verified whether apoptosis occurring in wt cells required the channel - forming activity of VacA . CS obtained from two isogenic mutants of H . pylori carrying a point mutation in the VacA gene ( P9A and G14A ) that renders the toxin unable of forming anion channels 7 , 29 were greatly ineffective in inducing cell death ( Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure 1a ) . When we measured vacuolization of wt and DKO MEFs in response to the CS of H . pylori wt , we found that DKO cells were much more responsive , reaching maximal vacuolization after 5 h ( Figure 2 ) , whereas wt cells showed little or no vacuolization until 24 h ( not shown ) . As expected , DKO cells did not vacuolated after exposing to the CS of the H . pylori mutant strain ( not shown ) . Thus , vacuolization and apoptosis seem to be independent , with the former even stimulated by the lack of BAX and BAK . In conclusion , the proapoptotic proteins BAX and BAK are required for VacA - induced apoptosis , which relies on its VacA channel properties . VacA - induced apoptosis involves BAX - dependent regulation at the mitochondrial level As BAX and BAK regulate apoptosis at multiple levels , 30 we reasoned that the insensitivity of DKO cells to VacA - induced apoptosis could reflect their downregulation of Ca 2 + levels in the ER . To test this possibility , we turned to a model of DKO MEFs whose multiple defects were genetically and selectively corrected : the mitochondrial one by targeting BAX exclusively to mitochondria , and the ER one by overexpressing sarco / endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + - ATPase ( SERCA ) , 30 the Ca 2 + - ATPase responsible for the uptake of Ca 2 + from the Cyt into the ER lumen . 31 Expression of mitochondria - targeted BAX ( mtBAX ) restored the sensitivity of DKO MEF cells to VacA - induced apoptosis , although cells remained more viable than their wt counterparts ( compare Figure 3a with 1a ) , probably because of the lack of BAK . Conversely , the overexpression of SERCA had no effect ( Figure 3b ) . This indicates that VacA falls into the category of stimuli that require mitochondria - based multidomain proapoptotics and can proceed despite depleted intracellular Ca 2 + stores . As expected , CS from the H . pylori VacA P9A channel mutant was also unable to trigger apoptosis in mtBAX - corrected DKO cells . In conclusion , VacA recruits the so - called ‘mitochondrial gateway’ of apoptosis to kill intoxicated cells . VacA induces BAX activation and its recruitment to mitochondria In resting cells the multidomain proapoptotic protein BAX resides as a monomer in the Cyt or is loosely attached to intracellular membranes . Once cells are stressed by an apoptotic stimulus , BAX becomes active , exposes its C - terminal α - 9 helix , and translocates to mitochondria . 32 - 34 This conformational change can be monitored by following the exposure of new epitopes using specific antibodies . The wt H . pylori CS induced BAX activation and the parallel staining with anti - VacA antibodies revealed a partial , but significant , colocalization between the two proteins ( Figure 4a ) . No BAX activation was observed after administrating the CS of the mutant strain , again underlining the central role of the VacA Calore et al . Page 3 Cell Death Differ .

The weaker VacA staining observed in the latter case was probably because of a less efficient entry of the toxin into the cell . We therefore waited until 48 h , when the staining of VacA increased ; yet , BAX did not become activated ( not shown ) . Furthermore , mitochondria purified from cells incubated for 24 h with wt CS revealed a clearcut recruitment of BAX that was completely absent in untreated cells or in cells exposed to the mutant strain ( Figure 4b ) . This was not a consequence of an increase in total BAX , as measured by specific immunoblotting in lysates of cell exposed to wt and mutant CS ( data not shown ) . The channel - forming region of VacA is required for its localization to mitochondria Whether VacA is targeted to mitochondria during apoptosis , or is retained in late endosomes , remains an open question . 23 , 24 , 27 Given the requirement of the mitochondrial gateway to induce apoptosis , we investigated the subcellular localization of VacA from its entry into the cell to the induction of apoptosis . In a preliminary set of experiments we verified that our subcellular fractionation of cells yielded pure mitochondrial and early and late endosomal fractions ( Figure 5 ) . We therefore monitored by immunoblotting the accumulation of VacA in purified mitochondrial and early and late endosomal subcellular fractions from cells incubated for 24 h with wt or with VacA P9A H . pylori CS . Wt VacA was present in both endosomal compartments , as expected for a toxin that enters the cells by endocytosis , and interestingly , in part also in the mitochondrial fraction ( Figure 6a ) . Conversely , VacA P9A accumulated in endosomal compartments without reaching mitochondria ( Figure 6a ) . Moreover , the mutated toxin was internalized less efficiently than the wt one , despite a similar concentration in the CS ( not shown ) . A gel overloaded with endosomal and mitochondrial proteins , purified from VacA P9A - intoxicated cells , permitted to exclude that the absence of the protein in mitochondrial fraction was because of its less efficient internalization ( Figure 6a ) . The role of the channel activity of VacA in its targeting to mitochondria was further confirmed by applying to the cells the other channel - defective mutant , VacA G14A ; 7 it accumulated in endosomes as well as the wt counterpart , but it did not reach mitochondria ( Supplementary Figure 1b ) . We further confirmed the subcellular localization of VacA by confocal microscopy using anti - VacA antibodies in MEFs expressing a mitochondrially targeted red fluorescent protein . Although in cells treated with the mutated VacA the distribution of the toxin - positive vesicles was clearly distinct from that of mitochondria , in cells incubated for 24 h with wt VacA several toxin - positive spots appeared closely apposed to mitochondria ( Figure 6b ) . Thus , association of VacA with mitochondria seems to require the same domain involved in channel formation . In VacA - intoxicated cells , endosomes are juxtaposed to mitochondria Our previous experiments left open the question of how VacA transited from endosomes to mitochondria , leading to BAX activation . We therefore decided to follow the subcellular localization of VacA in infected wt and DKO cells in parallel with BAX activation in the former . The wt toxin accumulated in the endosomal fractions as early as 2 h and 30 min after infection , although a small portion of the protein was already detectable in the mitochondrial fraction . After 12 h , wt VacA was extensively retrieved in the mitochondrial fraction , whereas endosomes exclusively remained positive for the mutated toxin ( devoid of channel activity ) . Unexpectedly , in cells treated with the active H . pylori CS , after as soon as 2 h and 30 min , BAX was retrieved in the early endosomes fraction , devoid of contamination by Cyt , as confirmed by the absence of the cytosolic marker GAPDH ( Supplementary Figure 2b ) . The major proportion of BAX recruited on endosomes was not membrane integral , as confirmed by its sensitivity to alkali extraction ( Supplementary Figure 2a ) . Notably , no recruitment of active BAX was detected on endosomal and mitochondrial fractions in cells exposed to mutated VacA , as well as in untreated cells ( Figure 7 ) . Furthermore , wt VacA induced a progressive accumulation of early ( EEA1 ) and Calore et al . Page 4 Cell Death Differ . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2011 March 4 . U KP M C F unde r s G r oup A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t U KP M C F unde r s G r ou p A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t late ( LAMP1 ) endosomal markers in the mitochondrial fraction ( Figure 7 ) . In contrast , when cells were incubated with the mutant in the channel - forming region of VacA ( P9A mutant ) , both markers were confined to their correspondent fraction and did not co - purify with mitochondria ( Figure 7 ) . Similarly , neither endosomal markers nor BAX were found associated with mitochondria in cells exposed to the other channel - defective mutant , VacA G14A ( Figure 8a ) . Importantly , the endosomal fractions of wt VacA - treated cells were not positive for a mitochondrial marker ( Figure 8b ) , indicating that the retrieval of BAX in endosomes was not an epiphenomenon of the accumulation of mitochondrial fragments within the endosomal fraction . Thus , VacA induces a major alteration in vesicular traffic that results in co - segregation of early and late endosomes with mitochondria , a situation similar to that reported in Fas - activated T cells . 35 This early alteration occurs around the same time as the accumulation of active BAX in the early endosomes fraction , well before its retrieval on mitochondria . It is noteworthy that no endosomal recruitment of the already mitochondrial BAK was observed ( not shown ) . Significant amounts of VacA accumulate in the mitochondrial fraction after 12 h of intoxication ( Figure 7 ) , when apoptosis is still not measurable , suggesting that targeting precedes induction of death . To confirm this , we turned to DKO cells , in which we expected to recapitulate the targeting to mitochondria of VacA and their cofractionation with endosomes , in the complete absence of apoptosis . Surprisingly , in these cells VacA did not colocalize at all with mitochondrial markers , nor it induced a co - segregation of endosomal and mitochondrial membranes within 12 h of intoxication ( Figure 7 ) . At 24 h , a small portion of VacA appeared to be targeted to mitochondria , even if endosomal markers did not reach the mitochondrial fraction . We wished to confirm that mitochondria and endosomes become closer in cells intoxicated with VacA . Immunofluorescence analysis of cells exposed to VacA further substantiated the ability of the wt toxin to promote juxtaposition between early / late endosomes and mitochondria ( Figure 9 ) , and suggested an association of endosomal vesicles ( containing VacA ) with mitochondria . It is noteworthy that the relocalization of endosomes in proximity to mitochondria was not observed in cells exposed to intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic stimuli , such as staurosporine , etoposide and TNF - α ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . This suggests that juxtaposition of endosome to mitochondria occurs specifically in cell exposed to VacA and is not a general feature of apoptosis . Immunoelectron microscopy analysis performed on intoxicated MEF cells further corroborated this finding . Intoxication of wt MEFs with CS from H . pylori wt strain , but not from the mutant one , for 2 h and 30 min triggered the juxtaposition of endosomal compartments ( positive to the late endosomal marker lysobisphosphatidic acid ( LBPA ) ) to mitochondria ( Figure 10a and see quantification in b ) . At the same time , endosomal area remained the same in wt VacA - intoxicated and untreated cells ( Figure 10c ) . Unfortunately , any attempt to visualize early endosome - positive structures failed as a consequence of the very poor immunoreactivity of the EEA1 antibody in our immunoelectron microscopy protocol ( not shown ) . In conclusion , the combination of subcellular fractionation , imaging and immunoelectron microscopy indicates that in cells intoxicated with VacA , mitochondria and endosomes are in close proximity . Notably , at longer time points the juxtaposition evolves in the engulfment of mitochondria in autophagosomes ( not shown ) . 36 Calore et al . Page 5 Cell Death Differ .

U KP M C F unde r s G r oup A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t U KP M C F unde r s G r ou p A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Discussion In this study we report that in cells intoxicated with the H . pylori cytotoxin VacA endosomes are retrieved in close proximity to mitochondria , in parallel with the accumulation of the toxin in the latter organelle . The endosomal markers EEA1 ( specific for early endosomes ) and LAMP1 ( more typical of late endosomes ) are enriched in the mitochondrial fraction after as early as 2 h and 30 min from intoxication . Hence , the colocalization of VacA with Rab7 reported by Yamasaki et al . 27 could reflect the same membrane mistargeting as documented here . We suggest that VacA targets mitochondria in virtue of the cross - talk between these organelles that may be enhanced during apoptosis induction . 35 In support of this conclusion , in Bax / Bak DKO cells that show no accumulation of endosomal markers in mitochondria , VacA remains confined at the endosomal level . The co - segregation of VacA and endosomal markers with mitochondria is not a mere consequence of apoptosis induction , because it occurs before any detectable cell death . Convergent traffic between endosomes and mitochondria has been previously documented in TNF - α - exposed hepatocytes , 37 Fas - activated T cells 35 and also reticulocytes , in which a direct shuttling of iron from one organelle to the other occurs without any cytosolic intermediary . 38 In addition , changes in the intracellular localization of mitochondria and generation of clusters of organelles has been reported in a variety of apoptotic settings . 39 Although this inter - organelle membrane traffic may be specific to some cellular contexts , the possibility that such a traffic pathway is constitutively present in other cell types deserves further investigation . Previous results showed that VacA induced activation of the proapoptotic proteins BAX and BAK . 27 However , the main proapoptotic ‘multidomain’ proteins BAX and BAK control not only the physical permeabilization of the outer membrane of mitochondria , 28 but also the levels of ER Ca 2 + and hence the susceptibility to Ca 2 + - dependent death stimuli . 30 Our results lend support to a model in which VacA engages the so - called ‘mitochondrial gateway’ of apoptosis . Cells lacking both Bax and Bak intoxicated with VacA do not die , indicating the requirement of these key mediators of apoptosis in the death by VacA . Re - expression of a BAX mutant exclusively targeted to mitochondria significantly restored cell sensitivity to the toxin , whereas the genetic correction of the reduced ER Ca 2 + levels of the Bax - and Bak - deficient cells did not restore their susceptibility to VacA . During apoptosis BAX can be targeted to different intracellular membranes , from mitochondria to ER to Golgi . 40 However , to the best of our knowledge , BAX has never been reported to localize on endosomes . More importantly , these organelles could serve as platforms for BAX recruitment onto mitochondria . Our data would be consistent with two models : ( 1 ) BAX is recruited to early endosomes in a VacA - dependent process ; BAX activated on endosomal membranes then drags the whole organelles to mitochondria by virtue of its affinity to the outer mitochondrial membrane ; and ( 2 ) alternatively , although a fraction of BAX is directly recruited to the mitochondrial membrane as a consequence of VacA intoxication , another fraction of BAX reaches the mitochondria through membrane trafficking involving endosomes . This latter model is consistent with the observation that the amount of BAX associated with mitochondria after 12 h of incubation with VacA is significantly greater than would be expected solely from its recruitment after intermixing of mitochondria with endosomes . The selectivity of BAX recruitment to early ( rather than late ) endosomes is not clear . Co - immunoprecipitation did not reveal any interaction between VacA and the proapoptotic protein . However , this is not indicative that the two proteins do not interact ; for example , co - immunoprecipitation between BID and BAX is similarly negative as the interaction occurs in the membrane . 41 This envisions a scenario in which VacA is responsible for the mistargeting of endosomal membranes close to the Calore et al .

U KP M C F unde r s G r oup A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t U KP M C F unde r s G r ou p A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t mitochondria . This seems to be an essential step for accumulation of VacA and BAX in mitochondria , thereby dictating the final amount of this proapoptotic protein accumulated in this organelle during VacA intoxication . The VacA - induced endosome relocalization , as well as the BAX recruitment onto these organelles , requires the channel - forming domain of VacA ; mutations in this region arrested the toxin in late endosomes , abrogated recruitment of BAX to endosomes and mitochondria and eliminated the proapoptotic effect of the toxin . Surprisingly , DKO cells are much more susceptible to vacuolization after VacA intoxication than their wt counterpart , showing that vacuolization and apoptosis are two genetically distinguishable processes , despite the requirement of channel - forming domain for both . As the different vacuolization does not result from an increased entry of the toxin in DKO cells , it raises the intriguing possibility that BAX and BAK are involved in an intracellular traffic of membranes . In this scenario , the absence of BAX / BAK would result in larger endosomes , explaining the pronounced effect of VacA on size and extent of vacuoles in DKO cells ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . If the constitutive pathway of endosomal remodeling is somehow blunted by the lack of these multidomain proapoptotics , more membranes would be available for vacuolization by VacA . Consistently , VacA is unable to induce the co - fractionation of endosomes and mitochondria in DKO cells . In conclusion , our work shows that apoptosis induced by VacA requires BAX and BAK and is Ca 2 + independent . Furthermore , it elucidates the route used by VacA to target mitochondria in the course of apoptosis and indicates an unexpected new function for the key proapoptotic protein BAX in the dynamics of intracellular organelles .

Endosomes were isolated at 4°C as described in Genisset et al . 29 In brief , cells were washed with ice - cold PBS , detached with a cell scraper and pelleted by centrifugation ( 500 × g , 10 min ) . They were then washed in 3 ml of Homogenization Buffer ( HB - EDTA , 0 . 25 M sucrose ( 8 % ) 3 mM imidazole and 0 . 5 mM EDTA pH 7 . 4 ) , pelleted ( 1300 × g , 10 min ) , resuspended in 0 . 7 ml of HB - EDTA and homogenized by 10 passages through a 22 - gauge ( 1 1 / 4 inch ) needle . After centrifugation ( 1300 × g , 10 min ) , post nuclear supernatant ( PNS ) was collected and its sucrose concentration was increased up to 40 . 6 % by slow addition of 62 % sucrose in HB - EDTA . PNS was then carefully layered on a cushion of 1 . 5 ml of 35 % and 1 ml of 25 % sucrose in EDTA . Tubes were filled with HB , and centrifuged at 35 000 r . p . m . for 1 h at 4°C in a SW60 Ti rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Fullerton , CA , USA ) . Late endosome - enriched fraction and early endosome - enriched fraction were collected at the interface between the 25 % sucrose and HB and between the 35 and 25 % sucrose , respectively . Purified mitochondria were obtained from the nuclear pellet ( NP ) discharged during the purification of endosomes . 35 In brief , NP was re - homogenized in assay buffer ( 0 . 12 M mannitol , 0 . 08 M KCl , 1 mM EDTA and 20 mM K - Hepes , pH 7 . 4 ) and centrifuged at 600 × g . The supernatant was layered onto a cushion of 1 M mannitol in assay buffer . Tubes were filled with 2 % BSA in assay buffer . After centrifugation at 9000 × g for 15 min at 4°C , pellet was resuspended in 0 . 5 ml of assay buffer , centrifuged at 10 000 × g for 10 min and finally resuspended in 25 μ l of assay buffer . Protein concentration of all subcellular fractions was determined by Bradford assay . 47 To obtain the cytosolic fraction , PNS collected from 24 - h - intoxicated cells was centrifuged three times at 8000 × g for 10 min at 4°C as described above . Mitochondria - free supernatant was centrifuged at 100 000 × g for 1 h at 4°C in a 100 Ti rotor ( Beckman Instruments ) and the supernatant was collected as cytosolic fraction . Immunoprecipitation , alkali extraction and immunoblotting Co - immunoprecipitation of VacA and BAX was performed as indicated by Sawada et al . 48 Purified mitochondria ( 1 mg ) were lysed in NP40 buffer ( 142 . 5 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 and 0 . 2 % Nonidet P40 ) supplemented with protease inhibitors ( 1 : 10 dilution of protease inhibitor cocktail ) . After preclearing of the sample with 20 μ l protein A - Sepharose at 4°C for 2 h , lysed mitochondria were added to the beads in the presence of 4 μ g of anti - BAX polyclonal antibody . After a 16 - h incubation at 4°C , beads were extensively washed with NP40 buffer plus 0 . 03 % BSA . Proteins were finally solubilized from beads in SDS - PAGE loading buffer , before being analyzed by western blot . For alkali extraction , early endosomes purified from cells incubated with H . pylori wt CS for 24 h were exposed to alkali treatment as described . 49 In brief , early endosomes were centrifuged at 100 000 × g for 1 h at 4°C in a 100 Ti rotor ( Beckman Instruments ) and 15 μ g was resuspended in 1 ml of 100 mM Na 2 CO 3 pH 11 . 5 , incubated for 30 min on ice , and centrifuged at 100 000 × g for 1 h at 4°C . The supernatant , containing alkali solubilized proteins , was collected and neutralized by HCl 1 M . Pellet , containing membrane integral proteins , was solubilized and proteins in both fractions were separated by SDS - PAGE and analyzed by western blot . For immunoblotting , the following antibodies were used : anti - EEA1 , LAMP1 BAX , VacA , TOM20 and COX II ( dilution 1 : 1000 ) . Antibodies anti - EEA1 and LAMP1 were used instead of anti - Rab5 and LBPA ( applied in immunofluorescence ) for identifying early Calore et al . Page 9 Cell Death Differ .

Genetic correction of DKO MEF cells Genetic correction of DKO SERCA and mtBAX DKO MEF cells was described in Scorrano et al . 30 GFP - BAX was reconstituted into Bax and Bak doubly deficient MEFs using an MSCV retroviral vector ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA , USA ) . Stable clones expressing BAX - fusion protein were generated by limiting dilution . Full - length murine BAX was fused with an 11 amino acid N - terminal hemagglutinin ( HA ) tag to generate HA - BAX . Mitochondria - targeted HA - BAX ( mtBAX ) was constructed by fusing the 29 amino acid mitochondrial - targeted sequence from subunit VIII of human cytochrome c oxidase ( COX VIII ) onto the N - terminal end of HA - BAX and was present on the outer mitochondrial membrane surface . Full - length rabbit SERCA - 2 and mtBAX were cloned into pcDNA3 for transient expression experiments and into a retroviral vector ( MFIG ) containing loxP - flanked green fluorescence protein ( GFP ) preceded by an internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) for stable expression . Stable clones were established by limiting dilution and were selected on the basis of GFP expression by FACS analysis . Protein expression levels of gene products were confirmed by immunoblot . Measurement of cell death MEF cells were incubated with the phosphatidylserine - binding protein Annexin - V conjugated to Alexa 568 ( Bender MedSystem , Burlingame , CA , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Viability was measured by flow cytometry ( FACSCalibur , BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) as the percentage of Annexin - V - negative events in the gated population . For the viability evaluation of genetically corrected DKO MEF cells ( SERCA or mtBAX ) the percentage of Annexin - V - negative events was performed in the GFP - positive gated population . Electron microscopy Immunoelectron microscopy was performed according to the conventional protocol of Tokuyasu 50 and adapted by Slot and Geuze . 51 MEF cells were fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde in PBS for 2 h at room temperature , embedded in 12 % gelatin and cooled at 4°C for 10 min . Convenient blocks were cut and infiltrated in 2 . 3 M sucrose overnight and then frozen in liquid nitrogen . Ultrathin cryosections ( 60 nm ) were cut and picked up in 1 : 1 2 . 3 M sucrose and 2 % metylcellulose . Cryosections were immediately immunolabeled for LBPA with mouse anti - LBPA ( dilution 1 : 20 ) , and detected with a rabbit anti - mouse antibody and Protein A gold 15 nm as previously described . 48 Statistical analysis Data were expressed as mean values±S . D . . Student’s t - test was used for statistical analysis of differences between H . pylori wt CS - treated cells versus P9A or G14A H . pylori CS - intoxicated cells / untreated cells . A P - value of ≤ 0 . 05 was considered as significant .
