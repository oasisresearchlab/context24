They are involved in the formation of nanodomains ( “ lipid rafts ” ) , which serve as important signaling platforms . Inva - sive bacterial pathogens exploit these signaling domains to trigger actin polymerization for the bending of the plasma membrane and the engulfment of the bacterium — a key process in bacterial up - take . However , it is unknown whether glycosphingolipids directly take part in the membrane invagination process . Here , we dem - onstrate that a “ lipid zipper , ” which is formed by the interaction between the bacterial surface lectin LecA and its cellular receptor , the glycosphingolipid Gb3 , triggers plasma membrane bending during host cell invasion of the bacterium Pseudomonas aerugi - nosa . In vitro experiments with Gb3 - containing giant unilamellar vesicles revealed that LecA / Gb3 - mediated lipid zippering was suf - ficient to achieve complete membrane engulfment of the bacte - rium . In addition , theoretical modeling elucidated that the adhe - sion energy of the LecA – Gb3 interaction is adequate to drive the engulfment process . In cellulo experiments demonstrated that inhi - bition of the LecA / Gb3 lipid zipper by either lecA knockout , Gb3 depletion , or application of soluble sugars that interfere with LecA binding to Gb3 significantly lowered P . aeruginosa uptake by host cells . Of note , membrane engulfment of P . aeruginosa occurred in - dependently of actin polymerization , thus corroborating that lipid zippering alone is sufficient for this crucial first step of bacterial host - cell entry . Our study sheds new light on the impact of glycosphin - golipids in the cellular invasion of bacterial pathogens and provides a mechanistic explication of the initial uptake processes . membrane curvature | glycolipid | infection G lycosphingolipids ( GSLs ) are essential components of bio - logical membranes that have significant impact on the or - ganization and the molecular architecture of the membrane ( 1 , 2 ) . Preferential association of GSLs with cholesterol , various other lipid species , and proteins induces formation of micro - and nano - domains . Such domains , which are also termed “ lipid rafts , ” are involved in the signal transduction across the membrane ( 3 ) . Sev - eral invasive bacterial pathogens hijack these membrane domains as signaling platforms for actin polymerization , which leads to the engulfment of the bacterium by the host plasma membrane ( PM ) ( 4 – 6 ) . For example , Listeria monocytogenes exploits lipid raft - dependent E - cadherin and HGF - R / Met signaling in the host cell to trigger actin polymerization for bacterial uptake ( 7 ) . The oppor - tunistic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa can also invade and survive in diverse epithelial and endothelial cells ( 8 – 14 ) , which significantly contributes to its pathogenicity ( 8 , 10 , 15 ) . Numerous reports suggested various host cell factors , including cell surface receptors and signaling components , including α 5 β 1 integrin , cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator , and Abelson tyro - sine - protein kinase 1 - dependent pathway ( 16 – 18 ) , that are involved in the cellular uptake of P . aeruginosa . Host - cell GSLs have been identified as important molecules contributing to host specificity and adhesion of P . aeruginosa ( 19 , 20 ) . Recent observations suggest that GSLs might be of critical importance for the internalization of P . aeruginosa into nonphagocytic cells ( 9 ) . The homotetrameric , galactophilic lectin LecA , which is localized to the outer bacterial membrane ( 21 ) , belongs to the carbohydrate binding proteins expressed by P . aeruginosa that recognize GSLs ( 22 , 23 ) and rep - resents one of the virulence factors ( 24 ) . The preferential binding of LecA to the GSL globotriaosylceramide ( also known as Gb3 / CD77 or Pk histo - blood group antigen ) ( 22 , 25 ) prompted us to investigate the role of LecA – Gb3 interaction in the cellular uptake of P . aeruginosa . In our study , we demonstrated that GSLs have a major impact on the bending of the host plasma membrane and engulfment of the pathogen . Binding of GSL by P . aeruginosa induced negative membrane curvature on synthetic , giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) , solely driven by LecA – Gb3 interaction . This interaction resulted in a bacterium tightly engulfed by the lipid bilayer of the GUV . Because the glycolipid component plays the major role in this process , we termed this mechanism “ lipid zipper ” as a novel zipper - type mode of bacterial entry ( 26 ) . Further experiments re - vealed that the lipid zipper has a significant impact on P . aeruginosa uptake in several epithelial cell lines . Interestingly , actin Significance Entry of bacteria into host cells critically depends on their proper engulfment by the plasma membrane . So far , actin polymerization has been described as a major driving force in this process . However , our study reveals that the interaction of the bacterial surface lectin LecA with the host cell glyco - sphingolipid Gb3 is fully sufficient to promote engulfment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , whereas actin polymerization is dispensable . Hence , the formation of a “ lipid zipper ” repre - sents a previously unidentified mechanism of bacterial uptake and demonstrates that bacterial pathogens have evolved lipid - based invasion strategies that may function in addition to protein receptor - based ones . Furthermore , by identifying the LecA / Gb3 interaction as the major invasion - promoting factor , our study provides new targets for drugs that may prevent bacterial invasion and dissemination .

Results A LecA – Gb3 Lipid Zipper Is Sufficient for Membrane Engulfment of P . aeruginosa in a Synthetic Lipid Bilayer System . We used Gb3 - containing GUVs as a membrane model system to directly ad - dress the impact of LecA – Gb3 interactions on the curvature of a lipid bilayer without any potential interference of cellular fac - tors , particularly actin . We incubated GUVs with the invasive P . aeruginosa PAO1 WT strain and a lecA deletion mutant ( Δ lecA ) that did not express LecA ( Fig . S1 , Inset ) . Both strains were chromosomally GFP - tagged and did not differ in their growth rates ( Fig . S1 ) . PAO1 WT not only bound to Gb3 - con - taining GUVs but also induced a highly curved GUV membrane at the contact point , which finally led to a complete engulfment of the WT bacteria by the GUV membrane ( Fig . 1 A and Fig . S2 A – C ) . Remarkably , we also observed membrane - engulfed bac - teria that were connected via tether - like structures to the sur - rounding GUV membrane ( Fig . S2 A , arrowhead and B ) . Inter - estingly , we observed clustering of lipid material at sites where bacteria attached to the GUVs and were engulfed ( Fig . 1 A ) . In total , 82 ± 6 . 5 % of the analyzed GUVs were bound by PAO1 WT and of these 45 ± 6 . 4 % showed bacteria , which were engulfed by the GUV membrane ( Fig . 1 B ) . In contrast , the Δ lecA mutant essentially did not induce membrane invaginations ( Fig . S2 D – F ) . Although still 22 ± 7 . 7 % of the GUVs were bound by the Δ lecA mutant ( Fig . 1 B ) , only 1 of 102 GUVs analyzed in total showed a membrane - engulfed bacterium . Lowering of the Gb3 concen - tration in GUVs from 5 to 0 mol % led to a dose - dependent decrease of GUVs containing membrane - engulfed bacteria ( Fig . 1 C ) , clearly indicating a crucial role of Gb3 in the process of bacterial membrane engulfment . Without Gb3 , only 1 of the 106 GUVs analyzed showed a wrapped bacterium . In the next step we addressed the impact of the mechanical properties of the GUV membrane . When decreasing the surface tension by applying a hyperosmolar buffer solution from the outside ( 550 mOsm · L − 1 outside vs . 290 mOsm · L − 1 inside the GUVs ) , GUVs containing 0 . 1 mol % Gb3 showed a number of membrane - wrapped bacteria comparable to that obtained with 5 mol % Gb3 GUVs at iso - osmolar conditions ( Fig . S3 and Fig . 1 C ) . Cholesterol plays a pivotal role in membrane physiology because it is implicated in the generation of lipid raft domains and can in - fluence membrane rigidity , which might affect the formation of the lipid zipper . Therefore , we compared the efficiency of lipid zipper formation on GUVs in the presence or absence of cholesterol . The efficiency was reduced by 65 % in the absence of cholesterol ( 45 ± 6 . 4 % vs . 15 . 7 ± 4 . 8 % ) , which , apparently , was not due to a decrease in binding of bacteria to GUVs , which was just 10 % less ( 70 ± 4 . 2 % ) compared with cholesterol - containing GUVs ( 81 . 7 ± 5 . 4 % ) ( Fig . 1 D ) . In summary , these data provide clear evidence that binding of LecA to Gb3 mediates a cholesterol - dependent , zipper - like engulfment of bacteria by the GUV membrane . The LecA – Gb3 Interaction Provides Enough Energy for Complete Engulfment of P . aeruginosa by a Lipid Membrane . We developed a theoretical model to investigate whether the LecA – Gb3 in - teraction is sufficient to mediate membrane engulfment of bac - teria . The GUV was described as an elastic surface consisting of mobile lipid constituents , and P . aeruginosa was modeled as a LecA - covered , rigid rod ( Fig . 2 A and SI Materials and Methods ) . The total energy of the system consists of three terms : ( i ) me - chanical Helfrich energy ( 27 ) , which favors flat membrane con - figurations ; ( ii ) curvature - promoting adhesion energy owing to LecA – Gb3 interaction ; and ( iii ) mixing entropy ( 28 ) of mobile lipids . The final configuration of the bacterium relative to the GUV membrane is the result of minimizing the total energy and depends solely on the physical properties of the system , that is , size of the bacterium , bending rigidity , and surface tension of the GUV membrane , as well as Gb3 density . In Fig . 2 B we show the wrapping height h of a bacterium ( L = 2 . 5 μ m ) in dependence of surface tension γ and Gb3 density σ for constant bending rigidity ( SI Materials and Methods ) . For realistic values of GUV Gb3 densities ( σ ≈ 10 5 μ m − 2 ) , the model predicts a complete mem - brane engulfment of the bacterium . Similar effects are predicted for the host - cell PMs , for which Gb3 densities in the range of σ = 1 , 400 − 7 , 400 μ m − 2 ( SI Materials and Methods ) and surface ten - sions between 10 μ J · m − 2 and 300 μ J · m − 2 ( 29 – 31 ) are realistic . Furthermore , the model reveals that LecA - dependent clustering of mobile Gb3 lipids is crucial . When Gb3 is kept immobile , the global Gb3 concentration required to achieve full engulfment increased by two orders of magnitude ( Fig . 2 C ; compare curves in color and black for mobile and immobile Gb3 , respectively ) . Full engulfment occurred at local Gb3 densities well below critical values ( i . e . , close packing of Gb3 ) ( compare Fig . 2 C and Fig . S4 C ) . To further explore the dependence of the wrapping on the global Gb3 density and the vesicle size , we incubated GUVs prepared from lipid mixtures containing different Gb3 concen - trations ( Materials and Methods ) with P . aeruginosa PAO1 WT . By microscopic analysis we measured the equatorial diameter of GUVs in a random field of view . On the basis of our model Fig . 1 . P . aeruginosa induces a lipid zipper on giant unilamellar vesicles by binding of LecA to Gb3 . ( A ) GUVs reconstituted with Texas Red - labeled 1 , 2 - dihexadecanoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( DHPE - TR ) and Gb3 were inoculated with GFP - tagged P . aeruginosa PAO1 WT ( PAO1 - GFP ) for 15 min at 37 °C .

( see above ) , we calculated the minimal vesicle size for which the bacteria would be fully wrapped ( h = 2 . 5 μ m ) for the global Gb3 density σ on the vesicle at the applied Gb3 concentrations . Fig . 2 D compares the experimental results with the theoretical pre - diction for three different surface tensions ( solid line , γ = 800 μ J · m − 2 ) . The shaded area in Fig . 2 D denotes the uncertainty range for the minimal vesicle size assuming that the bacterium is at least wrapped up to the spherical cap ( h = 2 . 25 μ m ) and a 40 % variation in the Gb3 content ( SI Materials and Methods ) . Addi - tionally , we experimentally tested our model by variation of the surface tension of GUVs as a critical parameter for bacterial wrapping ( Materials and Methods ) . According to the model the critical vesicle size should decrease with decreasing surface tension ( compare in Fig . 2 D the solid line for γ = 800 μ J · m − 2 with the dashed line for γ = 600 μ J · m − 2 ) . This should lead to an in - creased fraction of bacteria - wrapped GUV in the low - diameter range . The experimental results for GUVs with a diameter of ≤ 20 μ m show that the fraction of bacteria - wrapped GUVs is increased by 25 % at higher osmolarity compared with iso - osmolar con - ditions ( compare in Fig . 2 E GUVs with 0 . 1 mol % Gb3 at 290 vs . 550 mOsm · L − 1 ) . Taken together , our theoretical model shows that for typical Gb3 densities and surface tensions of GUVs and cells the energy provided by LecA – Gb3 binding and clustering is sufficient to induce total membrane engulfment of bacteria - sized objects . For engulfment of smaller particles such as viruses ad - ditional mechanisms were required ( SI Materials and Methods ) , which is in agreement with previous experimental and theoretical results ( 32 , 33 ) . LecA Promotes a Lipid Zipper on Epithelial Cells Independent of Actin Polymerization . In further experiments , we directly assessed whether a lipid zipper mechanism is implicated in bacterial invasion of living host cells . We first verified that cell entry of P . aeruginosa into our cell model , the human lung epithelial cell line H1299 , indeed depends on GSL expression , as previously reported ( 9 ) . Quantification of the cellular invasion of P . aeruginosa showed an 80 % reduction of invasion upon inhibition of GSL synthesis by D - threo - l - phenyl - 2 - palmitoylarmino - 3 - morpholino - l - propanol ( PPMP ) treatment , whereas bacterial attachment was not affected ( Fig . S5 A ) . Disappearance of Gb3 expression was verified by a loss of Shiga toxin B - subunit ( StxB ) binding to cells ( Fig . S5 B ) . In the following we studied the entry process of P . aeruginosa into H1299 cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy . Shortly after binding to H1299 cells , bacteria induced negative PM curvature at the cellular entry site ( Fig . S6 A ) that progressed into the engulfment of the bacterium by PM ( Fig . 3 A , arrow - heads ) . For the Δ lecA mutant , the number of PM - surrounded bacteria was significantly lower ( about 64 . 5 % ) at 1 h postin - fection compared with the WT strain ( Fig . 3 B ) , suggesting that mainly LecA contributes to the zipper - like engulfment of bac - teria by PM . In line with the GUV data , extraction of cholesterol by methyl - β - cyclodextrin treatment lowered the occurrence of zipper - like , PM - engulfed bacteria by about 50 % ( Fig . S7 ) and thereby to the same extent as observed for GUVs , with and without cholesterol ( Fig . 1 D ) . Interestingly , actin polymerization does not play a role for the PM engulfment of the bacteria , because actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex ( Arp2 ) depletion ( Fig . 3 D and Fig . S6 B and D ) ( 34 ) or latrunculin A treatment ( Fig . S6 E ) ( 35 ) did not prevent initial envelopment of bacteria by PM . Nevertheless , accumulation of actin , as well as of the PM marker GPI - mCherry , was frequently seen close to invading bacteria even in Arp2 - depleted cells ( Fig . 3 D ) . However , actin coverage seems not to be functionally linked to the formation of mem - brane invaginations , because we observed actin - covered , PM - enveloped bacteria under all perturbations ( Fig . 3 D and Fig . S6 E , arrowheads ) . Most likely , actin coverage around invading bacteria represents persistent , cortical actin filaments . To further test whether actin polymerization is redundant for the zipper process , we studied the interactions of WT bacteria with plasma membrane spheres ( PMS ) induced in H1299 cells that stably expressed the actin marker LifeAct - mCherry . In PMS , no endo - cytic machinery is present and ( cortical ) actin is excluded ( 36 ) . Intriguingly , we observed bacteria that were tightly engulfed by the membrane of PMS , which demonstrates membrane wrapping even in the absence of actin ( Fig . S8 ) . These PM - enveloped bacteria closely resembled those wrapped by GUV membranes ( Fig . S2 B and C ) . Therefore , we propose a mechanistic model in which actin polymerization is dispensable for membrane engulf - ment but required for completion of the invasion process and Fig . 2 . Gb3 binding and clustering predicts complete membrane engulfment of P . aeruginosa . ( A ) Rotationally symmetric geometry of a modeled rod - shaped bacterium engulfed by GUV membrane .

The shaded area shows the effect of uncertainty in effective Gb3 content in a single vesicle at γ = 800 μ J · m − 2 ( SI Materials and Methods ) . For the right column , the osmolarity of the outside buffer was increased from 290 to 550 mOsm · L − 1 , whereas the inside buffer was kept at 290 mOsm · L − 1 ; the thereby reduced surface tension enhances wrapping at moderate GUV sizes . The theoretical curves show qualitative agreement with the observed statistics . Eierhoff et al .

This hypothesis is supported by the fact that P . aeruginosa requires actin polymerization for complete entry into lung cells , as indicated by the reduced invasion into Arp2 - knockdown cells ( Fig . S6 C ) . LecA / Gb3 - Mediated Lipid Zipper Contributes Measurable Impact on the Cellular Invasion of P . aeruginosa . Because P . aeruginosa is capa - ble of inducing a Gb3 – LecA lipid zipper on GUVs ( Fig . 1 ) and cells ( Fig . 3 ) we quantified how the lipid zipper affects bacterial host - cell invasion efficiency . The P . aeruginosa PAO1 Δ lecA mutant strain showed a 61 . 3 % reduced invasion into H1299 cells compared with PAO1 WT ( Fig . 4 A , “ untreated ” ) . Next , we depleted PM Gb3 levels by StxB - induced endocytosis of Gb3 ( 32 ) ( Fig . S9 A and B ) . StxB - mediated depletion of Gb3 reduced the invasion of the WT strain into H1299 cells by 69 . 0 % ( Fig . 4 A , “ StxB - treated ” ) compared with untreated cells . No significant difference in invasion efficiency was observed with the Δ lecA strain on Gb3 - depleted ( “ StxB - treated ” ) and Gb3 - containing ( “ untreated ” ) H1299 cells . Additionally , we confirmed by ectopic expression of Gb3 in MDCKII cells that the invasion of PAO1 WT correlated with the amount of PM - localized Gb3 ( Fig . 4 B ) . Moreover , pretreatment of the bacteria with the LecA - binder para - nitrophenyl - α - D - galactopyranoside ( PNPG ) de - creased the invasiveness of PAO1 WT by 68 . 6 % ( Fig . 4 A , “ PNPG - treated ” ) . PNPG selectively prevented LecA , but not StxB , binding to cells ( Fig . S9 C and D ) . In contrast , cellular invasion by the Δ lecA strain was not affected by PNPG , because the invasion efficiency was at a similar level compared with the untreated Δ lecA strain . None of the tested conditions significantly affected the adhesion of P . aeruginosa PAO1 WT or Δ lecA strains to host cells ( Fig . 4 C ) . These findings strongly suggest a major role of LecA and Gb3 as internalization factors rather than adhesion factors . Moreover , the cholesterol dependency of the lipid zipper formation in GUVs and Fig . 3 . P . aeruginosa induces plasma membrane invaginations depending on LecA .

Invasion in cholesterol - depleted cells was significantly de - creased by about 70 % compared with control cells ( Fig . S10 ) . This suggests an overall critical role of cholesterol for the lipid zipper in vitro and in cellulo . To test the capacity of LecA as an invasion factor , we explored the invasiveness of a noninvasive E . coli strain upon induced expression of lecA by isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) ( 25 ) . Remarkably , ectopic expression of lecA in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) transduced this strain into an invasive one , evi - denced by a significant increase of invasion into H1299 cells of about 340 % compared with non - lecA - expressing E . coli strains ( Fig . 4 D ) . Interestingly , adherence of lecA - expressing E . coli to H1299 cells was drastically reduced ( approximately 20 - fold ) compared with the non - lecA - expressing E . coli strains ( Fig . 4 D ) . Probably LecA functionally interferes with endogenous adher - ence factors of E . coli , which consequently prevents efficient adhesion to H1299 cells . However , these findings highlight the dominant , invasin - like function of LecA . In summary , these data demonstrate that Gb3 and LecA represent key factors for the cellular entry of P . aeruginosa into nonphagocytic cells . Discussion By studying the interaction of P . aeruginosa with synthetic and cellular membranes we have identified a mechanism for bacterial entry that requires host GSLs and bacterial lectins but does not depend on actin polymerization for membrane engulfment . The lipid zipper highlights the particular importance of glycolipids in bacterial invasion processes . Numerous host - cell factors have been described to interact with P . aeruginosa to orchestrate cel - lular entry and infection of the bacterium . Therefore , it is in - triguing that only two interacting factors , the host - cell GSL Gb3 and the bacterial , GSL - binding lectin LecA are sufficient to in - duce the initial processes of the cellular entry of P . aeruginosa . GSLs are key components of lipid rafts and as such are in - volved in establishing signal transduction platforms in biological membranes ( 1 , 37 ) . Cholesterol has been described to cluster GSLs in the external leaflet of the PM and thereby to stabilize lipid raft domains . We show that the lipid zipper mechanism depends on lipid raft components such as cholesterol and the GSL Gb3 , whereas a nonraft lipid , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) , does not directly promote the in - duction of the lipid zipper . Our results suggest that cholesterol stabilizes LecA - induced domains with a sufficiently high Gb3 den - sity to trigger the lipid zipper , and finally the efficient cellular in - vasion . Therefore , our findings expand the lipid raft concept because ( i ) they introduce an autonomous role for GSLs ( i . e . , Gb3 ) in triggering an endocytic event , uncoupled from cytoplasmic sig - naling processes , and ( ii ) consider raft domains to serve as mem - brane areas providing sufficiently high GSL densities for lipid zippering bacterial pathogens . The effect of cholesterol on membrane stiffness is complex . Membrane stiffness is not necessarily decreased in cholesterol - depleted membranes . It could even be increased , at least in choles - terol - depleted cells ( 38 ) . We found that cholesterol extraction on cells decreased the frequency of the lipid zipper , which could , in line with ref . 38 , point to an increase in membrane stiffness , impairing the lipid zipper . Following a study on DOPC vesicles , cholesterol has no ( significant ) effect on bending rigidity ( 39 ) . However , we found a significantly lower occurrence of the lipid zipper in cho - lesterol - free GUVs . Interpreting our results in the context of the above - mentioned report ( 39 ) , cholesterol might affect the lipid zipper on GUVs by mechanisms other than membrane stiffness . Studies of SV40 entry engaging the GSL GM1 for cellular entry ( 33 ) revealed that the chemical structure of the GSL ( i . e . , fatty acid chainlengthandsaturation ) iscriticalfortheuptake . Therefore , itwill be interesting to investigate in future studies whether and how dif - ferent Gb3 species affect the uptake of P . aeruginosa . It is well established that the cellular uptake of Gram - negative bacterial pathogens ( e . g . , Salmonella and Shigella species ) critically depends on secreted bacterial effector proteins that induce a re - organization of the host cytoskeleton ( 40 , 41 ) . The expression of a type - III secretion system ( T3SS ) by P . aeruginosa and T3SS - and T6SS - secreted effector proteins have been reported to be required for the cellular invasion and are supposed to influence the growth - phase dependent cellular uptake of P . aeruginosa ( 11 , 42 – 45 ) . However , our data suggest that initial membrane curvature and wrapping of the bacterium by the host PM depends neither on a bacterial secretion system nor on secreted effector proteins . Furthermore , actin polymerization and an active endocytic ma - chinery are not required for the formation of PM invaginations , as suggested by actin inhibition experiments . The GUV experiments and model calculations clearly demonstrate that the induction of membrane invaginations by P . aeruginosa through LecA – Gb3 in - teractions is a thermodynamically favored , ATP - independent process that does not depend on cytosolic factors or on bacterial effectors . However , other bacterial and cellular effector proteins might be necessary to accelerate and / or finalize the uptake . In analogy to a previous report indicating that actin dynamics drive membrane scission on StxB - induced membrane invaginations ( 46 ) , actin could be actively involved in late stages of endocytic pro - cessing of PM invaginations . In addition , because P . aeruginosa induces membrane curvature , curvature - sensing Bin Amphiphysin Rvs . ( BAR ) domain - containing proteins ( 47 ) might be recruited to the entry site and activate signaling pathways to promote the cel - lular uptake of P . aeruginosa . Moreover , our work demonstrates a previously unidentified pathophysiological relevance for LecA . So far , LecA has been re - lated to bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation ( 20 , 48 ) and represents one of the virulence factors contributing to lung injury during infection ( 24 ) . Our data identify LecA as an invasion factor for P . aeruginosa , which might contribute to the dissemination of the pathogen within its host organism during infection . This is strongly supported by the finding that ectopic lecA expression induced an invasive phenotype of an originally noninvasive E . coli strain . Moreover , this finding shows that LecA does not need to interact with specific P . aeruginosa factors to fulfill its invasive function . Inhibition of the LecA / Gb3 - dependent pathway reduced host - cell invasion by P . aeruginosa . Therefore , strategies to interfere with the binding of LecA to Gb3 could be the basis for new drugs that efficiently prevent the dissemination and persistence of P . aeruginosa . Moreover , many bacterial pathogens express lec - tins on their cellular surface that recognize host GSLs ( 49 ) . In the context of our findings , it is possible that these pathogens use GSL - dependent mechanisms to trigger their uptake by host cells , alternatively or synergistically to protein receptor - based entry pathways , such as the invasin - induced entry of Yersinia ( 50 ) or the internalin - triggered pathway of Listeria spp . ( 51 , 52 ) . Clearly , the lipid zipper mechanism that drives bacterial in - vasion shares some common features with the GSL - mediated endocytosis of toxins ( 32 ) and viruses ( 33 , 53 ) . Multivalent lectin – glycosphingolipid interactions trigger the formation of plasma membrane invaginations in the absence of cytosolic proteins ( e . g . , coat proteins and actin ) . However , for bacteria , in contrast to smaller particles such as toxins and viruses , the adhesion energy resulting from lectin - induced GSL clustering is already sufficient to overcome the energy penalty for membrane bending as an initial step for their cellular uptake . Materials and Methods Detailed materials , methods , and the theoretical model are described in SI Materials and Methods . Briefly , GUVs were prepared as described ( 54 ) . H1299 and MDCKII cells stably expressing marker proteins or Gb3 synthase were cultured in RPMI or DMEM supplemented with Geneticin and 10 % ( vol / vol ) ( 5 % vol / vol ) FBS . Recombinant LecA - , lecA - , and non - lecA - expressing E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) were produced as reported ( 25 ) . GFP tags and LecA mutants of Eierhoff et al . PNAS | September 2 , 2014 | vol . 111 | no . 35 | 12899 M I C R O B I O L O G Y P . aeruginosa PAO1 were produced as described in SI Materials and Methods . Invasion assays were performed as essentially described ( 11 ) . GSL synthesis was inhibited by incubation of cells for 3 d with 5 μ M PPMP . For LecA in - hibition , soluble LecA ( 2 μ g · mL − 1 ) or bacteria were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 10 mM PNPG . Gb3 and cholesterol was depleted using 5 μ g · mL − 1 Cy3 - labled StxB and 10 mM methyl - β - cyclodextrin , respectively . Actin poly - merization was inhibited by latrunculin A treatment ( 0 . 1 μ M ) or knockdown of Arp2 by siRNA . PMS were induced as described ( 36 ) and visualized by FM4 - 64 dye . Cells , GUVs , and P . aeruginosa infection were imaged on a confocal microscope ( Nikon Eclipse Ti - E with A1R confocal laser scanner , 60 × oil ob - jective , N . A . 1 . 49 ) . Statistical testing was performed with Excel with data of n ≥ 3 independent experiments using two - tailed , unpaired t test , unless stated otherwise . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . W .
