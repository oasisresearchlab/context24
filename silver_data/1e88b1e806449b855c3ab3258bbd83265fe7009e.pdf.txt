Smart Construction and Sustainable Cities Research attitudes at a crossroads : advancing research on smart and sustainable cities Shui‑Long Shen 1 * The educational paradigm embraced in society for dec - ades has predisposed learners to mechanical think - ing patterns . There are obvious differences between the research attitudes of the pioneers of the “Scientific Revolution” and that of today’s researchers , who are no strangers to the modern education system . Single - dis - cipline - centred research tends to restrain the learners’ creativity and beliefs about cognitive abilities . How can the adoption of more ambitious research strategies ( e . g . , multidisciplinary schemes ) impact scientific innovation ? What role will Smart Construction and Sustainable Cities ( SCSC ) play in promoting multidisciplinary research ? 1 The original intention of the research matter Like their medieval predecessors before them , the pio - neers of the “Scientific Revolution” [ 1 ] such as Coper - nicus , Galileo , and Isaac Newton , fell into science by interest and the want to understand the world around them . Several of these scientists initially attended uni - versity with the intent of absorbing and learning the liberal arts ( including astronomy , geometry , and arith - metic ) from their predecessors . For instance , Newton attended the Trinity College of Cambridge in the early 1660s [ 2 ] . These scholars , however , regarded the knowl - edge taught by these institutions as old - fashioned . They , therefore , began developing new ideas and methods that would become unrivalled contributions to science . For example , Newton developed calculus to tackle the issues he encountered in his physics research . He later devel - oped the law of gravitation , which is one of the most remarkable discoveries from the 1660s to the present time . The common thread among the pioneers of the Scien - tific Revolution is the practice of education and research , with interest as the primary motivation . This interest promoted the concomitant exploration of various dis - ciplines by scholars around that period . Karl Terzaghi , the father of modern soil mechanics , founded the disci - pline based on the aforementioned interest - motivated research . He originally studied mechanical engineering at a university which provided him with a sound foun - dation in mechanics [ 3 ] . Terzaghi was also fascinated by geological science and , at some point , combined these two disciplines ( explaining geological phenomena from a mechanical perspective ) to create soil mechanics [ 3 ] . He subsequently developed additional futuristic concepts for geotechnical engineering . These examples demonstrate that the original intention of research should not be sin - gle - focused i . e . , constrained by professional or academic disciplines . What made early scientists successful was their practice of curiosity - driven research and the explo - ration of various disciplines . However , with university development , discipline - focused curricula have gradually been adopted by higher education systems worldwide . 2 Mono‑discipline oriented research : a myth or an opportunity From the early modern period to the twentieth century , Western universities have substantially evolved in terms of their structure and functioning . For instance , the * Correspondence : Shui‑Long Shen shensl @ stu . edu . cn 1 College of Engineering , Shantou University , Shantou , China Page 2 of 3 Shen Smart Construction and Sustainable Cities ( 2023 ) 1 : 1 twentieth century brought about a dichotomy between science and technology , developing into different disci - plines , such as geotechnical engineering , structure engi - neering , engineering management , water conservancy engineering , and traffic engineering . This differentiation among disciplines promoted the systemic training of graduates based on discipline rather than interest ( in contrast to the research attitudes discussed previously ) . This shift in the educational paradigm has generated changes in the attitudes of learners / scholars towards research . Due to the uniqueness of the research focus , for example , graduate students are very likely to have a discipline - constrained perception of their research , which , combined with potential suboptimal tutoring , sel - dom produces innovative achievements . In reality , early research attitudes have been lost over the decades due to the evolution of educational structures and systems . It is speculated that the creative abilities of early research - ers comprised short paths between concepts and high connectivity . Individuals with higher creativity gener - ally demonstrate a flexible network structure indicative of creative thinking [ 4 ] . This characterisation of creative thinking and semantic memory contrasts , for example , with the current doctoral training system , which tends to convey little research , thereby limiting the creative think - ing of the learner . This state of play substantiates the rela - tive stagnation of certain disciplines ( e . g . , soil mechanics and physics ) that have witnessed no significant break - throughs in decades or even centuries . The lack of dis - coveries has resulted in an endless stream of practical engineering problems , which existing theories have failed to accurately predict or solve . 3 A needed resurgence of early research attitudes While the development of modern technology has opened up new opportunities for solving long - deemed indecipherable problems , the resurgence of ancient research attitudes is bound to hinder the dynamics of innovation and discovery . It is critical to recourse to research approaches that promote an interdisciplinary exploration of targeted mechanisms , to regain the “origin of research” . The origin or original intention of research should be free from the limitations of discipline and direction . An effective method for scientific research is a combination of inductive and deductive reasoning . The reader can refer to Nola [ 5 ] for a detailed introduction to these methods . As a matter of illustration , in the early 1920s , Terzaghi used his personal perception or “art sensing” to propose the assumption of effective stress based on his long - term “live with the soil” ( means one must love and under - stand every aspect of soil behaviour both in the labora - tory and in the field ) [ 3 ] . Since Terzaghi hypothesised the concept of effective stress in 1923 , macroscopic meas - urement of this quantity has always been achieved using an indirect method . Specifically , the effective stress has been obtained by subtracting the measured pore water pressure from the measured total stress . Although this approach has been deemed trustworthy , the develop - ment of a direct measurement method has remained at an embryonic stage for decades owing to innovation dif - ficulties and stagnation . With the development of opti - cal fibre technology , this centennially unsolved case has been effectively resolved in recent years by Hong Kong - based researchers [ 6 ] . Their work provided experimental confirmation of Terzaghi’s hypotheses . This contribution was an unprecedented achievement in the field of soil mechanics following Terzaghi’s seminal work . The devel - opment of modern information perception technologies , e . g . , sensors and digital technologies is bound to upgrade our early “art sensing” and promote the development of innovative construction techniques that preserve the sus - tainability of modern cities . Some examples include good results obtained via the observation of field disc cutter wear [ 7 ] and shield vibration [ 8 ] to judge the geological characteristics and timing of the cutter . More construc - tion technologies have been developed to guide intel - ligent compaction processes and quality control using global positioning systems [ 9 ] . Data - driven methods are also applied in underground space [ 10 ] and disaster pre - vention in urban areas [ 11 ] . Moreover , green material [ 12 ] for sustainable cities is another aspect of the needs . 4 Role of smart construction and sustainable cities The journal Smart Construction and Sustainable Cit - ies is committed to the promotion and interdisciplinary research that embraces the philosophy discussed above . This provides an interdisciplinary forum for applying information technologies to the construction and man - agement of sustainable cities . Cities are economic powerhouses that serve as nerve centres for the global economy and society and have the potential to be agents of positive change . However , rapid and disorderly urbanisation has led to deep inequalities and an unsustainable urban environmental reality . The challenges posed by the urbanisation trend are numer - ous , spanning social , economic , and environmental issues that are intertwined . Insecurity , public health , inequality , pollution , waste management , and accessi - bility of services are responsible for the well - being and development of people . Making cities more inclusive , safe , resilient , and sustainable , as called for in SDG11 , is a timely and pressing necessity . The development of smart cities is a rational strategy to achieve this . The Fourth Industrial Revolution has generated powerful technolo - gies that are pivotal game - changers . Smart Construction Page 3 of 3 Shen Smart Construction and Sustainable Cities ( 2023 ) 1 : 1 and Sustainable Cities offer a forum for the discussion of intelligent solutions to achieve smart governance of societies and self - adaptive and sustainable cities . More importantly , the journal embraces a multidisciplinary vision towards valuable research / scientific achievements in the application of information science and technol - ogy for the development of smart and sustainable cities . Therefore , in line with the previously discussed ‘research attitudes’ , Smart Construction and Sustainable Cities wel - come research from various disciplines , including civil engineering , artificial intelligence , urban planning and management , manufacturing , urban governance , data science , transportation , mechanical engineering , elec - tronic information , and computer science . The journal will feature transformative solutions , sys - tematic approaches , science - policy - practice , and inno - vative systems to support the development of urban intelligent construction and maintenance , intelligent manufacturing , intelligent perception and digital image processing , the future urban brain , and intelligent com - puting . Furthermore , in support of innovation and nov - elty , the journal has waived article processing charges . The authors , therefore , do not need to pay any article pro - cessing charges for its early issues . The journal strongly welcomes stimulating comments , reviews , perspectives , case studies , communications , and original research fall - ing within the scope of the journal and in support of the Sustainable Development Goals , particularly SDG11 .
