( A ) Schematic representation of the role of epsin in the coupling of the endocytic clathrin coat to actin in cooperation with Hip1R ( left ) . This coupling helps invaginate the pit . Only epsin localized at the equator of the bud is shown to emphasize its actin - related function in pit invagination , but epsin is not restricted to the equator . Higher magnification representation of the interactions of epsin ( right ) : the N - terminal ENTH domain binds ( 1 ) the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich membrane bilayer of the plasma membrane ( and partially penetrates it ) , ( 2 ) the ANTH domain of Hip1R , and ( 3 ) synaptobrevin2 / VAMP2 ; its tail binds ( 1 ) ubiquitinated cargo proteins ( via UIMs ) , ( 2 ) AP - 2 and clathrin heavy chain ( via DPF / DPW motifs and ‘clathrin boxes’ , respectively ) , and ( 3 ) the EH domain region of Eps15 ( via NPF motifs ) . Epsin ' s tail also binds F - actin and co - oper - ates with the THATCH domain of Hip1R in the coupling of the actin cytoskeleton to the clathrin - coated pit . In both fields Hip1R is depicted as a monomer but functions as a dimer , or heterodimer with Hip1 . ( B ) Schematic represen - tation of the multiple functions of epsin in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Epsin participates in the early stages of the reaction as a coat nucleator , curvature inducer / sensor and also helps coupling bud formation to SNARE incorporation . As the coat matures , ubiquitinated cargo is recruited . Additionally , the link between epsin / Hip1R and actin is required for the deep invagination of the pit , and this is the process at which the action of epsin becomes essential . Subsequently , the force produced by actin and the bilayer destabilizing properties of epsin ' s ENTH domain may co - operate with dynamin in fission . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 03311 . 013
