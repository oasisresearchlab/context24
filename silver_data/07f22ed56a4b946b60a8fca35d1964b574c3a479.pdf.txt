LPA acts through six known G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , termed LPA 1 – 6 , which show both overlapping and distinct signaling properties and tissue distributions [ 1 , 2 ] . The three classical and best studied LPA receptors , LPA 1 – 3 , belong to the so - called Edg subfamily of GPCRs . Three additional LPA receptors , termed LPA 4 ( formerly P2Y9 ) , LPA 5 ( GPR92 ) and LPA 6 ( P2Y5 ) stand apart from the Edg family and are more closely related to the purinergic receptor family , strongly suggesting that LPA receptors have evolved from distinct ancestor genes [ 1 , 2 ] . LPA receptors couple to multiple G protein - effector pathways , accounting for the multitude of cellular responses to LPA . LPA is a major constituent of serum [ 3 ] and is produced through the hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine ( LPC ) by a secreted lysophospholipase D , named autotaxin ( ATX ) , originally identified as a motility - enhancing factor for melanoma cells ( reviewed in [ 4 , 5 ] ) . The ATX - LPA signaling axis is of vital importance for embryonic development [ 4 ] and is an effector of tumor growth , angiogenesis and metastasis in mice [ 6 – 11 ] . Cell migration plays a key role in embryogenesis , tissue renewal , immune responses and cancer metastasis . Most tumor cells , including carcinoma , lymphoma , glioma and melanoma cells , show an enhanced migratory response to LPA ( positive chemo - taxis ) [ 12 – 17 ] . Where examined , LPA - induced migration is primarily mediated by Edg - family LPA 1 and LPA 2 receptors and involves both G i - and G 12 / 13 - mediated signaling pathways . One non - Edg - family receptor , notably LPA 4 , has been reported to suppress cell migration [ 18 ] . In general , cell migration is driven by pathways controlled by Rho GTPases and phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , acting in a coordinate fashion to control the spatiotemporal dynamics of cytoskeletal components . However , soluble second messengers such as Ca 2 + [ 19 , 20 ] and cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) [ 21 , 22 ] also play crucial roles in directing cell migration and chemotaxis . Here we show that , unexpectedly , LPA strongly impedes the basal and growth factor - induced migration of B16F10 melanoma cells . We show that the inhibitory effect of LPA is mediated by the LPA 5 receptor and that a rise in cAMP with consequent activation of protein kinase A ( PKA ) is an important effector of LPA 5 - mediated chemorepulsion , with a possible additional role for reduced phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) signaling . Our results identify LPA 5 as an anti - migratory receptor and they point to a mechanism of LPA - induced chemorepulsion likely to be relevant for tumor cells that predominantly express LPA 5 , acting to override positive chemotactic signals . Results and Discussion LPA , serum and autotaxin inhibit B16 cell migration in a highly polarized fashion When testing various tumor cell types for their chemotactic response to 1 - oleoyl - LPA ( LPA ( 18 : 1 ) ) and serum ( FCS ) in transwell assays , we found that B16F10 melanoma cell migration is strongly inhibited by both FCS and LPA ( 18 : 1 ) ( Figure 1A , B ) . Under serum - free conditions , B16 cells show a high rate of basal , ‘spontaneous’ transwell migration during a 3 hr assay period . Addition of FCS or LPA to the lower transwell chamber inhibited the basal migration of B16 cells almost completely . Half - maximal inhibitory effects were PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 December 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 12 | e29260 observed at , 100 nM LPA and 1 % FCS ( containing up to 50 nM LPA ; [ 3 ] ) ( Figure 1A , B ) . Strikingly , the inhibitory effects were observed only when LPA and FCS were present in the bottom well of the transwell chamber . LPA or serum added to the top well had no detectable effect on cell migration , regardless of the concentra - tion or the direction of the LPA gradient across the filter ( Figure 1C ) . In other words , the inhibitory response to LPA is highly polarized . In keeping with this notion , LPA had no detectable effect on the random motility of B16 cells in low - density culture , as evidenced by time - lapse video microscopy ( not shown ) . LPA is produced extracellularly from lysophosphatidylcholine ( LPC ) by autotaxin ( ATX ) . Addition of LPC ( 18 : 1 ) alone to the lower chamber had no effect , but cell migration was significantly inhibited when LPC was added together with recombinant ATX ( Figure 1D ) . Again , inhibition of migration was only observed when ATX plus LPC were present in the lower chamber . Even though the basal migration rate of B16 cells is already high , it could be further enhanced by hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) . As shown in Figure 1E , LPA reduced the chemotactic activity of HGF by some 60 % , but only when both LPA and HGF were present in the lower chamber . This result defines LPA as an anti - chemotactic agonist for B16 cells . Based on these findings , we conclude that LPA inhibits B16 cell migration in a highly polarized fashion , likely reflecting localized LPA receptor signaling in the extending pseudopodia . We also tested the effect of LPA on B16 cell proliferation . Melanomas are often characterized by activating mutations in B - Raf , leading to constitutive activation of the mitogenic MAPK / ERK1 / 2 pathway . B16F10 cells , however , express wild - type B - Raf [ 23 ] . Consistent with their normal B - Raf status , B16 cells showed very low basal MAPK / ERK1 / 2 activity , which was strongly enhanced upon LPA addition ( Figure 2A ) . Yet , LPA ( up to 10 m M ) did not significantly affect the rate of B16 cell proliferation , either in the presence or absence of limiting concentrations of serum ( Figure 2B ) . Dissection of LPA signaling pathways : involvement of cAMP and protein kinase A We next set out to explore the signaling determinants of the chemorepulsive effect of LPA . Optimal transwell migration was observed with cells plated on fibronectin - coated membranes . When B16 cells were plated on poly - L - lysine , which does not interact with integrins , migration was similarly inhibited by LPA ( Figure 3A ) . Thus , the anti - migratory effect of LPA is independent of the nature of the adhesive substrate and , by inference , does not involve specific integrins . Figure 1 .

Pretreatment of B16 cells with PTX ( 200 ng / ml ) did not affect the basal cell migration rate nor its inhibition by LPA , which rules out the involvement of G i - linked pathways . In addition , we used the Rho - kinase ( ROCK ) inhibitor Y27632 , the protein kinase C inhibitor Ro - 31 - 8220 and two MEK inhibitors ( PD598059 and U - 0126 ) , which were added to both chambers . However , none of these inhibitors influenced the anti - migratory effect of LPA during a 4 hrs time period ( data summarized in Table S1 ) . The lack of effect of Y27632 is somewhat unexpected , since the RhoA - ROCK pathway is known to mediate contractile and anti - migratory events and , furthermore , underlies LPA - induced chemorepulsion of neuronal growth cones ; in the latter case , Y27632 can even convert chemorepulsion into chemoattraction [ 24 ] . We measured RhoA - GTP levels in B16 cells before and after LPA stimulation , but were unable to detect a significant effect of LPA on RhoA - GTP accumulation in these cells ( data not shown ) . Given the multifunctional role of cAMP in cytoskeletal regulation and cell migration , we tested the cAMP - raising agents forskolin and 8 - Br - cAMP . Both stimuli partly mimicked LPA in inhibiting the basal migration rate of B16 cells ( Figure 3B and Table S1 ) , indicating that cAMP is a candidate messenger for mediating LPA - induced chemorepulsion . cAMP acts through activation of protein kinase A ( PKA ) , while at higher levels it exerts additional effects through activation of Epac [ 25 ] . Epac is an exchange factor for the Rap GTPase and is activated by direct binding of cAMP . The PKA inhibitor H - 89 attenuated the inhibitory responses to LPA and forskolin without affecting the basal migration rate ( Figure 3C ) , whereas the Epac activator 8CPT - 2Me - cAMP [ 26 ] had no detectable effect on cell migration ( Table S1 ) . We confirmed that H - 89 inhibits PKA activity by using a FRET - based PKA sensor in forskolin - treated cells as described previously [ 27 ] . To monitor changes in cAMP , we used the FRET - based cAMP sensor CFP - Epac - YFP [ 27 ] . When expressed in mammalian cells , CFP - Epac - YFP shows a significant FRET signal that rapidly decreases upon a rise in cAMP [ 27 ] . In B16 cells expressing this biosensor , LPA induced an initial transient rise in cAMP lasting for about 5 min , followed by a prolonged phase of elevated cAMP levels ( Figure 4A , B ) . From these results we conclude that the cAMP - PKA pathway , rather than the cAMP - Epac - Rap pathway , contributes to LPA - induced chemorepulsion . LPA - induced PIP3 depletion from the plasma membrane In many cases , directed cell migration is critically dependent on the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trispho - sphate ( PIP3 ) , which recruits PH - domain - containing proteins to regulate F - actin remodeling and other key signaling events . Local changes in PIP3 levels can be readily visualized by the Figure 2 . Effect of LPA on ERK1 / 2 activity and cell proliferation . A . LPA - induced activation of ERK1 / 2 in B16F10 cells .

Most , if not all , chemoattractants activate phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) to induce rapid accumulation of PIP3 at the plasma membrane , as detected by the translocation of PIP3 - sensitive probes from the cytosol to the plasma membrane [ 28 – 30 ] . Using PH - GRP1 - GFP as a biosensor , we found that non - stimulated B16 cells show already relatively high basal PIP3 levels at the plasma membrane . LPA triggered a rapid depletion of PIP3 from the plasma membrane as inferred from the translocation of PH ( GRP1 ) - GFP to the cytosol ( Figure 4C , D and Video S1 ) . The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin induced a more sustained depletion of PIP3 from the plasma membrane ( Figure 4C , D ) and inhibited the basal migration of B16 cells ( Table S1 ) . We also examined the PIP3 - dependent phosphor - ylation state of Akt ( protein kinase B ) [ 31 ] . Consistent with the PIP3 imaging results , basal pAkt levels were high in non - stimulated B16 cells . LPA induced a modest fall in pAkt levels , while a PI3K inhibitor reduced basal pAkt levels to almost zero ( Figure S1 ) . It thus appears that LPA - induced chemorepulsion of B16 cells is associated with ( i ) an increase in intracellular cAMP and ( ii ) PIP3 depletion from the plasma membrane . PIP3 depletion is not secondary to a prior rise in cAMP levels , since the cAMP - raising agonist a - melanocyte - stimulating hormone ( a - MSH ) ( see below ) and forskolin failed to trigger PIP3 depletion ( Figure 4D and data not shown ) . Whether LPA - induced PIP3 depletion is due to inhibition of basal PI3K activity or enhanced PIP3 phosphatase activity , or both , remains to be determined . Chemorepulsion is mediated by LPA 5 , an alkyl - LPA preferring receptor Which LPA receptor ( s ) mediate ( s ) the observed chemorepulsive effect ? Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that B16 cells co - express LPA 2 , LPA 5 and LPA 6 , with the relative expression levels of LPA 5 and LPA 6 being much higher than that of LPA 2 ( Figure 5A ) . We used siRNA to knock down LPA 5 and LPA 6 and assess the effects on migration . The inhibitory effect of LPA on cell migration was largely abolished after knockdown of LPA 5 , but not after knockdown of LPA 6 . LPA 5 knockdown did not significantly affect the basal cell migration rate , nor did it alter the expression levels of LPA 2 and LPA 6 ( Figure 5B , C ) . This strongly suggests that LPA 5 mediates the anti - migratory response of B16 cells . Figure 4 . LPA - induced changes in cAMP and PIP3 in B16 cells . A – B .

We therefore compared the efficacy of LPA ( 18 : 1 ) to that of the corresponding ether - linked analog 1 - O - alkyl - LPA ( 18 : 1 ) . As shown in Figure 5D , alkyl - LPA ( 18 : 1 ) was , 10 - fold more potent than acyl - LPA ( 18 : 1 ) in inhibiting cell migration ( IC 50 , 10 nM versus 100 nM ) . This difference in potency cannot be reconciled with Edg - family LPA receptors ( LPA 1 - 3 ) , which prefer the acyl forms of LPA . This result confirms critical involvement of LPA 5 in mediating the anti - migratory response to LPA . To further establish the anti - migratory potential of LPA 5 , we evaluated LPA 5 in HeLa cells . These cells express LPA 1 , LPA 2 and LPA 5 at about equal mRNA levels ( Figure 6A ) , while their basal migration rate is very low ( Figure 6B ) . LPA induced a robust chemotactic response in HeLa cells . In LPA 5 - overexpress - ing HeLa cells , however , LPA - induced chemotaxis was signifi - cantly reduced ( Figure 6B ) . These results support the view that the relative expression pattern of LPA receptors in a given cell type determines migration outcome . That is , the chemorepulsive activity of LPA is observed in those cells where LPA 5 is the predominant receptor , overriding the chemoattractant activity of LPA 1 and LPA 2 . LPA 5 mediates an increase in cAMP Thus far , the signaling properties of LPA 5 / GPR92 have been inferred from heterologous expression studies [ 34 – 37 ] . LPA 5 / GPR92 - transfected B103 neuroblastoma cells undergo cytoskeletal contraction ( Rho kinase - dependent ) , Ca 2 + mobilization and an increase in cAMP after LPA addition , whereas control B103 cells do not [ 35 ] . The rise in cAMP is not mediated by the canonical G a s pathway , but most likely involves bc subunits ; there is no evidence for LPA 5 coupling to G i pathways [ 35 ] . To assess whether the increase in cAMP in LPA - treated B16 cells ( Figure 4B ) is mediated by LPA 5 , we monitored cAMP levels in LPA 5 - depleted B16 cells . While the LPA - induced rise in cAMP was not affected in cells treated with non - targeting siRNA , it was absent in LPA 5 knockdown cells ( Figure 7A , B ) , indicating that LPA 5 mediates the cAMP signal . We next expressed LPA 5 in HEK293 cells , as these cells do not normally show a rise in cAMP upon LPA stimulation ( Figure 7C ) . In LPA 5 - transfected HEK293 cells , LPA evoked a significant increase in cAMP with kinetics similar to those observed in B16 cells ( Figure 7D ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that LPA 5 is a cAMP - elevating receptor , both in its native cellular context and in transfected cells , and they reinforce the notion that the anti - Figure 5 .

Comparing LPA to a - MSH and sphingosine 1 - phosphate To confirm that cAMP serves as an anti - migratory signal we used a - MSH , an agonist of G a s - coupled melanocortin receptors . It has been reported that a - MSH suppresses the metastatic potential of B16 cells but does not affect their proliferation [ 38 ] . a - MSH induced a very rapid and prominent increase in cAMP ( Figure 8A , B ) and partly inhibited B16 cell migration , regardless of whether a - MSH was present in the lower or upper chamber ( Figure 8C ) ; the latter result clearly differs from LPA action . The anti - migratory effect of a - MSH was less pronounced than observed with LPA , while the rise in cAMP is more rapid and more sustained , similar to what is observed with forskolin . The marked difference between the a - MSH - and LPA - induced cAMP signals must reflect a fundamental distinction between the canonical ( a s ) and the noncanonical ( bc ) pathway , respectively , by which GPCRs can stimulate cAMP production . Together , these results support the view that cAMP is an anti - migratory signal for B16 cells . However , a - MSH and forskolin appear to act globally , whereas LPA signals in a polarized manner . Further - more , LPA triggers PIP3 depletion from the plasma membrane , whereas a - MSH does not ( Figure 4D ) . Inhibition of B16 cell migration is also induced by sphingosine 1 - phosphate ( S1P ) , acting through the S1P 2 receptor , which has been associated with altered Rac / Rho - kinase signaling [ 39 ] . Unlike LPA , however , S1P inhibited B16 cell migration when the agonist was present alone in the upper chamber ; furthermore , S1P failed to affect basal cAMP levels in B16 cells ( Figure S2 ) . This suggests that S1P 2 and LPA 5 differ fundamentally in their anti - migratory signaling mechanisms . LPA 5 subcellular localization Next , we asked whether the polarized response of B16 cells to LPA is attributable to an asymmetrical distribution of LPA 5 . Certain GPCRs show a polarized subcellular localization as exemplified by the P2Y receptor family [ 40 ] . In MDCK epithelial cells , a subset of P2Y receptors resides at the basolateral membrane , while other P2Y members are only found at the apical plasma membrane [ 40 ] . We examined the distribution of HA - tagged LPA 5 in MDCK , HeLa and B16 cells . However , none of these cell types showed a clear asymmetric distribution of LPA 5 ( Figure S3 ) . We therefore assume that the polarized response of migrating B16 cells to LPA is a reflection of localized effector pathways in the pseudopodia , rather than of localized LPA 5 expression . Conclusions How does the cAMP - PKA pathway , with a possible additional role for reduced PIP3 signaling , contribute to the chemorepulsive effect of LPA 5 ? PKA can exert both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration [ 41 ] , but its action is very complex since PKA acts on numerous target proteins depending on agonist , cell type and subcellular localization of PKA [ 42 ] . In epithelial cells , the PKA catalytic subunit ( encoded by PRKCA ) emerged as an anti - migratory gene from RNAi screens [ 43 , 44 ] . In fibroblasts and carcinoma cells , the cAMP - PKA pathway can inhibit cell migration by interfering with lamellipodia formation [ 45 ] . Other studies show that PKA is enriched in protrusive pseudopodia [ 46 , 47 ] , but the specific PKA substrates remain to be identified . Inhibition of cell migration by LPA 5 most likely occurs through PKA - mediated and PIP3 - dependent mod - ulation of components in the Rho / Rac and cytoskeletal assembly pathways . Localized PKA activation , along with PIP3 depletion , would then lead to destabilization and retraction of extending pseudopodia . Chemoattractants and repellents cooperate during tumor cell migration and metastasis , and hence the outcome of cell migration is dictated by the relative expression levels of individual receptors . While the precise mechanisms underlying LPA 5 - mediated che - Figure 8 . Effects of a - MSH on cAMP and cell migration . A – B .

By inhibiting cell migration , LPA 5 - selective agonists might have therapeutic potential for those tumors in which LPA 5 is a predominant receptor . Caution will be needed , however , since LPA 5 signaling may also impact on platelet and mast cell functions [ 32 , 33 , 48 ] .

Transfections of LPA 5 and CFP - Epac - YFP plasmids were done using Fugene according to the manufacturer’s protocol , using 10 m g of DNA on 25 m l of Fugene for a 10 - cm dish with 3 6 10 6 cells in suspension . Transfection efficiency was determined by side - by - side transfection with GFP and was typically around 75 % . PH ( GRP1 ) - GFP was transfected into B16F10 cells using Fugene according to the manufacturer’s protocol , using 1 m g of DNA on 3 m l of Fugene6 per well on a 6 - well plate . Efficiency was typically around 30 % . Cell migration assays Cell migration was measured using 48 - well chemotaxis chambers ( Neuro Probe , Inc . ) equipped with 8 m m - pore polycar - bonate membranes , which were coated with either fibronectin or poly - L - lysine ( 20 m g / ml ) . Cells ( 1 6 10 6 / ml ) were added to the upper chamber . Fatty acid - free BSA ( 1 mg / ml ) was used as a lysophospholipid carrier . Migration was allowed for 3 hrs for B16F10 and 24 hrs for HeLa cells at 37 u C in humidified air containing 5 % CO 2 . Migrated cells were fixed in Diff - Quik Fix and stained using Diff - Quik II . Migration was quantified by color intensity measurements using TINA software . Western blotting Cells were washed in ice - cold PBS ( phosphate - buffered saline containing 2 mM Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ) , lysed in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors and spun down . 15 m l of lysate was loaded onto a 4 – 12 % NuPage H Bis - Tris Gel . Electrophoresis was carried out at 200 V for 40 min in NuPage H MOPS running buffer . Protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot H Dry Blotting System . The membrane was blocked for 1 hour at room - temperature in 50 mg / ml non - fat milk powder in TBST . Incubation with antibodies was done overnight at 4 u C . Proteins were visualized using chemiluminescence . Monitoring cAMP Intracellular cAMP levels were monitored in real - time using the FRET - based CFP - Epac - YFP sensor , as described [ 27 ] . Transfect - ed cells on coverslips were placed on an inverted NIKON microscope and excited at 425 nm . Emission of CFP and YFP was detected simultaneously through 470 6 20 and 530 6 25 nm band - pass filters . Data were digitized and FRET was expressed as the ratio of CFP to YFP signals , the value of which was set to 1 . 0 at the onset of the experiments . Changes were measured as percentage deviation from this initial value . PIP3 imaging Agonist - induced changes in the levels of phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) in the plasma membrane were monitored using a biosensor consisting of the PIP3 - specific PH domain of GRP1 ( general receptor for phosphoinositides - 1 ) fused to GFP , PH ( GRP1 ) - GFP [ 28 ] . PH ( GRP1 ) - GFP - transfected B16F10 cells were grown on glass coverslips and serum starved overnight . Live - cell imaging was done on a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope equipped with an Ar 488 laser system . Images were taken using a 63 6 NA 1 . 32 objective . Coverslips were mounted in a metal ring system and buffer was applied ( 140 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 23 mM NaHCO 3 , 10 mM HEPES , 10 mM glucose ) . Cells were selected randomly . Agonists were added while images were collected at appropriate time intervals ( 2 – 7 . 5 sec ) .
