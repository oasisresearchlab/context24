Although these homeo - static F - actin networks are usually investigated separately , competition for a limited pool of actin monomers ( G - actin ) helps to regulate their size and density . However , the mechanism by which G - actin is correctly distributed between rival F - actin networks is not clear . Using a combination of cell biological approaches and in vitro reconstitution of competition between actin assembly factors , we found that the small G - actin binding protein proﬁlin directly inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin assembly . Proﬁlin is therefore required for formin to compete effectively with excess Arp2 / 3 complex for limited G - actin and to assemble F - actin for contrac - tile ring formation in dividing cells . INTRODUCTION Within a common cytoplasm , cells simultaneously assemble and maintain multiple F - actin networks of different organization and dynamics for diverse processes ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ; Michelot and Drubin , 2011 ) . Fission yeast assembles three primary F - actin network structures , each of which depends on a speciﬁc actin assembly factor ( Kovar et al . , 2011 ) . Approximately 15 , 000 active Arp2 / 3 complexes , distributed between 30 and 50 endocytic actin patches , assemble short - branched F - actin networks that consume up to 50 % of the actin ( Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ; Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) . Less than 1 , 000 active formins use (cid:1) 20 % of the actin to assemble long - unbranched F - actin for either contractile rings ( formin Cdc12 ) or polarizing actin cables ( formin For3 ) ( Kovar et al . , 2011 ; Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) . We recently found that actin patches , contractile rings , and actin cables are in homeostasis , whereby their density and size are regulated in part by competition for G - actin ( Burke et al . , 2014 ) . How then is actin properly distributed into different networks , and how can (cid:1) 10 - fold fewer formins successfully compete with an excess of Arp2 / 3 complex ? Despite an effective critical concentration for actin assembly of only 0 . 1 m M , cells maintain a reserve of 10 – 100 m M un - assembled G - actin ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ) . High concentrations of unassembled actin are maintained by a combination of G - actin - binding proteins that prevent spontaneous nucleation of new ﬁlaments and barbed end capping proteins that prevent elongation of ﬁlaments ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ) . Proﬁlin is the primary evolutionarily conserved small G - actin - binding protein ( Carlsson et al . , 1977 ) , which is typically present in con - centrations similar to unassembled G - actin ( Kaiser et al . , 1999 ; Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) . Proﬁlin binds tightly ( K d = 0 . 1 m M ) to ATP - G - actin ( Perelroizen et al . , 1994 ; Vinson et al . , 1998 ) , and thereby prevents spontaneous actin nucleation and elongation of the actin ﬁlament pointed end ( Kang et al . , 1999 ; Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ; Pring et al . , 1992 ) . Proﬁlin has been regarded as a general actin cytoskeleton housekeeping factor , which is assumed to maintain a reserve of unassembled G - actin that is similarly available for incor - poration into diverse actin ﬁlament networks ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ) . However , proﬁlin binds directly to continuous proline residue stretches in actin assembly factors such as formin and Ena / VASP ( Ferron et al . , 2007 ) . Proﬁlin thereby signiﬁcantly increases the elongation rate of formin - assembled ﬁlaments ( Kovar et al . , 2003 , 2006 ; Romero et al . , 2004 ) , and is required for formin to assemble F - actin efﬁciently in vivo ( Evangelista et al . , 2002 ) . Here , we used complementary in vivo ﬁssion yeast experiments and single molecule in vitro reconstitution approaches to test our hypothesis that proﬁlin regulates com - petition for G - actin by favoring formin - mediated over Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin assembly . RESULTS The Ratio of Proﬁlin to Actin Is Critical for Proper F - Actin Network Homeostasis We previously reported that speciﬁc actin expression levels are critical for proper F - actin network distribution in ﬁssion yeast ( Burke et al . , 2014 ) . One possibility is that altering actin expres - sion disrupts the appropriate ratio of proﬁlin to actin . Actin over - expression ( low proﬁlin / actin ratio ) favors Arp2 / 3 complex actin patches , whereas actin underexpression ( high proﬁlin / actin ratio ) favors formin contractile rings ( Burke et al . , 2014 ) . The ratio of soluble proﬁlin to actin in wild - type cells is (cid:1) 0 . 8 ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . We perturbed this ratio by overexpressing Developmental Cell 32 , 1 – 11 , January 12 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 1 Please cite this article in press as : Suarez et al . , Proﬁlin Regulates F - Actin Network Homeostasis by Favoring Formin over Arp2 / 3 Complex , Develop - mental Cell ( 2015 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . devcel . 2014 . 10 . 027 ( O . E . ) actin , proﬁlin SpPRF ( Cdc3 ) , or both in ﬁssion yeast cells by replacing their endogenous promoters with the thiamine - repressible Pnmt1 promoter ( Figure 1 ) . Growing cells in the absence of thiamine for 22 hr increases soluble proﬁlin (cid:1) 20 - fold , and soluble actin (cid:1) 4 - fold ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . In general , O . E . proﬁlin ( proﬁlin / actin = 17 ) favors formin Cdc12 contractile rings , whereas O . E . actin ( proﬁlin / actin = 0 . 2 ) favors Arp2 / 3 com - plex actin patches , and O . E . both ( proﬁlin / actin = (cid:1) 3 . 6 ) restores F - actin network homeostasis ( Figures 1C ) . Speciﬁcally , O . E . pro - ﬁlin reduces the density of actin patches more than 2 - fold ( Fig - ure 1D ) , because the actin patch initiation rate is reduced by more than half ( Figure 1F ) , but patch internalization is not ulti - matelyprevented ( Figures1Gand1H ) . Thesefeweractinpatches have double the peak Lifeact - GFP ﬂuorescence ( Figure 1H ) , but the reasons are not clear . Conversely , O . E . actin increases the density of actin patches (cid:1) 1 . 5 - fold ( Figure 1D ) and the duration ofactin patchdisassembly ( Figure1H ) , butcompletely eliminates contractile rings ( Figure 1E ) ( Burke et al . , 2014 ) . Importantly , O . E . actin and proﬁlin simultaneously suppress contractile ring and actin patch defects caused by O . E . either actin or proﬁlin alone ( Figures 1D – 1H ) , and signiﬁcantly rescues growth defects caused by O . E . actin alone ( Figure S1 available online ) ( Balasu - bramanian et al . , 1994 ; Magdolen et al . , 1993 ) . These results emphasize a critical balance between proﬁlin and actin that ensures the proper density and dynamics of formin Cdc12 con - tractile rings and Arp2 / 3 complex actin patches .

Proﬁlin Has Separable Roles in Actin Patch and Contractile Ring Assembly Because changing the ratio of proﬁlin to actin affects actin patches and contractile rings differently , we suspected that proﬁlin has different roles in these processes . It is well documented that proﬁlin is required for contractile ring assembly ( see Figures 2F and 2G ) ( Balasubrama - nian et al . , 1994 ; Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) , presumably because proﬁlin increases the elongation rate of ﬁlaments assembled by formin Cdc12 (cid:1) 100 - fold ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ) . However , the role of proﬁlin in actin patch assembly is less clear . We compared the behavior of actin patches , labeled with the general F - actin marker Lifeact - mCherry , in wild - type ( WT ) and temperature sensitive proﬁlin mutant cdc3 - 124 cells . At the restrictive temperature of 36 (cid:3) C , patches in cdc3 - 124 cells incor - porate (cid:1) 2 - fold more actin and internalize one - third as far as actin patches in WT cells ( Figures 2A – 2C ; Movie S1 ) , indicating that proﬁlin’s role is to limit incorporation of actin into patches . Actin patch defects in cdc3 - 124 cells at 36 (cid:3) C are suppressed by inhib - itingArp2 / 3complexwith50 m MCK - 666 ( Figures2Dand2E ) , sug - gesting that overassembly of actin into patches in the absence of proﬁlin inhibits patch movement , possibly by trapping an endo - cyticvesiclebyadenseF - actinnetworkattheplasmamembrane . Conversely , inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex with CK - 666 at the permissive temperature of 25 (cid:3) C also decreases patch motility , indicatingthatdecreasedF - actinnetworkdensityinthepresence of CK - 666 is less efﬁcient in promoting patch internalization . We next investigated whether it is possible to separate the roles of proﬁlin in actin patches and contractile rings .

Therefore , contractile ring assembly requires that proﬁlin associates with both G - actin and formin Cdc12 ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ) , whereas proﬁlin’s function in actin patches depends only on binding G - actin . Collectively , these in vivo experiments reveal that proﬁlin has separate roles in actin patches and contractile rings , and that proﬁlin speciﬁcally limits the amount of actin incorporated into patches . Proﬁlin Inhibits Arp2 / 3 Complex - Mediated F - Actin Branching In Vitro Because overexpressing proﬁlin reduces the number of actin patches , whereas actin patches in proﬁlin loss - of - function mutant cdc3 - 124 cells incorporate more actin , we suspected that proﬁlin inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex . Proﬁlin reduces Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin assembly in ‘‘bulk’’ pyrene actin assays ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Rodal et al . , 2003 ) , although the branch density was not determined . We tested whether proﬁlin inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro by directly observing the assembly of Oregon green - actin with total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) . In the presence of its WASP activator SpWsp1 ( VCA ) , ﬁssion yeast SpArp2 / 3 complex generates a branched F - actin network with (cid:1) 0 . 08 branches per micron after 6 minutes ( Figures 3A Developmental Cell 32 , 1 – 11 , January 12 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 3 Please cite this article in press as : Suarez et al . , Proﬁlin Regulates F - Actin Network Homeostasis by Favoring Formin over Arp2 / 3 Complex , Develop - mental Cell ( 2015 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . devcel . 2014 . 10 . 027 and 3B ; Movie S2 ) . WT proﬁlin SpPRF inhibits branching by at least 4 - fold in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . SpPRF also inhibits SpArp2 / 3 complex in the presence of formin Cdc12 ( Figures 3A and 3B ; Movie S2 ) , as well as in ‘‘bulk’’ pyrene actin assays ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . Proﬁlin also inhibits branch formation by SpArp2 / 3 complex and full - length SpWsp1 ( FL ) , which contains a proline - rich domain expected to bind proﬁlin ( Figures S2C – S2E ) . Signiﬁcantly , the ability of the ligand - speciﬁc proﬁlin mutants to suppress actin patch defects in proﬁlin mutant cdc3 - 124 cells ( Figures 2A – 2C ) correlates with their ability to inhibit SpArp2 / 3 complex in vitro ( Figure 3B ; Figure S2B ) . SpPRF ( Y5D ) inhibits SpArp2 / 3 complex in vitro and largely re - stores normal actin patches in vivo . Conversely , SpPRF ( K81E ) does not inhibit SpArp2 / 3 complex in vitro and completely fails to suppress actin patch defects in vivo . Therefore , the ability of proﬁlin to stimulate formin - mediated actin assembly can be separated from its ability to inhibit Arp2 / 3 complex , and inhibi - tion of Arp2 / 3 complex by proﬁlin is required for normal actin patch dynamics . Proﬁlin Inhibits Arp2 / 3 Complex by Competing with WASP for G - Actin Activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by WASP and subsequent daughter branch formation involves multiple steps ( Pollard , 2007 ) , and proﬁlin could inhibit one or more of these steps . For example , it is possible that by binding Arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) , proﬁlin might prevent the association of Arp2 / 3 complex with WASP . Alternatively , proﬁlin might compete with WASP for G - actin ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ; Rodal et al . , 2003 ) . We tested these possibilities with biochemical assays . An excess of 58 m M WT proﬁlin SpPRF only slightly decreases the amount of 0 . 3 m M SpArp2 / 3 complex that is pulled down by 2 m M GST - SpWsp1 ( VCA ) with glutathione - sepharose beads ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . On the other hand , a series of ﬂuorescent anisotropy assays revealed that proﬁlin decreases the apparent afﬁnity of SpWsp1 ( VCA ) for G - actin by (cid:1) 5 - to 7 - fold ( Figures 3E – 3H ) . TMR - labeled SpWsp1 ( VCA ) binds to G - actin with a dissociation constant K d of (cid:1) 21 nM ( Figure 3E ) , which is similar to the afﬁnity measured by FRET ( K d = 15 . 5 nM ) ( Nolen and Pollard , 2008 ) . The inclusion of near - saturating amounts of SpPRF increases the apparent K d to 105 nM ( Figure 3F ) , and a similar increase ( apparent K d = (cid:1) 150 nM ) was measured by add - ing a range of proﬁlin concentrations in a competition - binding assay ( Figure 3G ) . Importantly , the ability of ligand - speciﬁc pro - ﬁlin mutants to disrupt the association of G - actin with SpWsp1 ( VCA ) ( Figure 3H ) correlates with their ability to inhibit branching by SpArp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 3B ) . SpPRF ( Y5D ) dis - rupts the association of G - actin with SpWsp1 ( VCA ) and inhibits branching , whereas SpPRF ( K81E ) does not inhibit either . Together these results reveal that proﬁlin directly inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated branching in vitro by sequestering G - actin away from WASP Wsp1 ( VCA ) , consistent with partial overlap of WH2 domain and proﬁlin binding sites on the barbed end of an actin monomer ( Chereau et al . , 2005 ) .

Proﬁlin may therefore be capable of favoring formin - over Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin assembly . We tested this possibility by using two - color TIRFM to observe the consequences of adding proﬁlin to in vitro reactions contain - ing a mixture of an (cid:1) 400 - fold excess of SpArp2 / 3 complex to ﬂuorescent - labeled formin SNAP - 549 ( red ) - Cdc12 ( FH1 1P FH2 ) ( Figures 4A – 4D ; Movie S3 ) . Initially Oregon green - actin was assembled in reactions containing SpArp2 / 3 complex , SpWsp1 ( VCA ) and formin Cdc12 , which produces ﬁlaments that are formed ( 1 ) spontaneously , ( 2 ) nucleated by formin Cdc12 , or ( 3 ) branches nucleated by Arp2 / 3 complex . These initial conditions without proﬁlin are favorable for all three types of nucleation , but not elongation by Cdc12 . We then ﬂowed in a new mix of Oregon green - actin with SpArp2 / 3 complex and SpWsp1 ( VCA ) , in the absence or presence of SpPRF . Without proﬁlin , SpArp2 / 3 complex is favored because the branch den - sity increases over time , whereas Cdc12 - associated ﬁlaments elongate (cid:1) 20 - fold slower than free barbed ends ( Figures 4A , 4C , and 4D ; Movie S3 ) . Conversely , the addition of WT SpPRF favors formin because the rate of formation of new branches is reduced (cid:1) 10 - fold ( Figures 4B – 4D ; Movie S3 ) , whereas the elongation rate of Cdc12 - associated ﬁlaments increases 25 - fold , resulting in an (cid:1) 15 - fold increase of Cdc12 - assembled F - actin after 180 s ( Figures 4B – 4D ; Movie S3 ) ( Kovar et al . , 2003 , 2006 ) . Neither separation of function proﬁlin mutant enhances formin - mediated actin ﬁlament elongation ( Figure 4D ; Figures S3A and S3B ) ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ) , and only SpPRF ( Y5D ) inhibits SpArp2 / 3 complex - mediated branch formation ( Fig - ure 4C ; Figures S3A and S3B ) . Thus , although proﬁlin reduces nucleation by both Arp2 / 3 complex and formin , proﬁlin favors formin - mediated actin assembly by speciﬁcally increasing the elongation rate of formin - associated ﬁlaments . Biomimetic Reconstitution of Competition between Arp2 / 3 Complex and Formin In Vitro Within cells , Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation - promoting factors such as WASP are clustered , and different F - actin networks are assembled at distinct locations ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ) . We used two - color TIRFM biomimetic assays with WASP and formin clustered on different polystyrene beads , which spatially sepa - rates the assembling F - actin networks . Because the activity of ﬁssion yeast formin Cdc12 is low on polystyrene beads , these reactions contained vertebrate formin mDia2 , mammalian Arp2 / 3 ( mArp2 / 3 ) complex , a pWA fragment of its WASP acti - vator that includes a central proline - rich domain , and human proﬁlin HPRO1 or ﬁssion yeast proﬁlin SpPRF . Proﬁlin HPRO1 potently inhibits the nucleation of branched networks from beads by mArp2 / 3 complex , but has little effect on their elongation . Figures 5A – 5E and Movie S4 show F - actin networks assembled by mArp2 / 3 complex from TMR ( red ) - actin on the surface of beads coated with GST - pWA . Addition ( time = 0 s , blue arrows ) of Oregon Green - actin with mArp2 / 3 complex labels new actin incorporation into the networks . Two successive rounds of ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleach - ing Oregon green - actin ( red arrows ) reveal that in the absence of proﬁlin , new mArp2 / 3 complex branched ﬁlaments are contin - uously generated from the bead surface ( Figure 5E ) . Conversely , the inclusion of 5 m M proﬁlin HPRO1 signiﬁcantly reduces Oregon green - actin ﬂuorescence recovery at the bead surface , indicating that mArp2 / 3 complex branch formation is inhibited ( Figure 5E ) . On the other hand , both proﬁlin HPRO1 and SpPRF enhance the elongation of formin mDia2 - mediated networks from beads . Figure S4 shows F - actin networks assembled on formin SNAP - mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) - coated beads . Formin mDia2 - assem - bled ﬁlaments elongate 4 - fold slower than control ﬁlaments in the absence of proﬁlin ( Figures S4A and S4B ) . Conversely , mDia2 - assembled ﬁlaments elongate (cid:1) 4 - and (cid:1) 2 - fold faster than control ﬁlaments in the presence of SpPRF ( Figures S4 C and S4D ) or HPRO1 ( Figures S4E and S4F ) ( Kovar , 2006 ) .

For - min mDia2 - mediated ﬁlaments continue to elongate rapidly because formin inhibits capping protein by remaining proces - sively associated with the elongating barbed end ( Zigmond et al . , 2003 ) . On the other hand , the combination of proﬁlin and capping protein severely blocks F - actin network assembly from GST - pWA - coated beads because proﬁlin reduces the number of branches and capping protein blocks their elongation . Proﬁlin Antagonizes Arp2 / 3 Complex to Facilitate Formin - Mediated Actin Assembly in Fission Yeast By simultaneously inhibiting Arp2 / 3 complex branching and facilitating rapid formin - mediated actin elongation in vitro ( Fig - ures 4 and 5 ) , proﬁlin could be a key regulator of F - actin network homeostasis in cells . We therefore investigated cytokinesis in proﬁlin mutant cdc3 - 124 ﬁssion yeast cells , in both the presence and absence of functional Arp2 / 3 complex , to test whether inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex by proﬁlin is required for formin - mediated actin assembly ( Figure 6 ) . At permissive temperature , asynchronous WT and cdc3 - 124 cultures contain only (cid:1) 20 % of dividing cells , without cytokinesis defects . Conversely , after 4 hr at the semipermissive tempera - ture of 33 . 5 (cid:3) C , (cid:1) 80 % of cdc3 - 124 cells develop signiﬁcant cyto - kinesis defects with abnormal contractile rings and septa , and two or more nuclei ( Figures 6A – 6E ) ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1994 ; Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) . Cytokinesis defects in cdc3 - 124 cells are signiﬁcantly suppressed by inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex with intermediate concentration of the Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor CK - 666 ( Figures 6A – 6E ) , or by mutations in Arp2 / 3 complex ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1996 ; McCollum et al . , 1996 ) . Thus , formin function is restored by inhibiting formin’s competitor for actin monomers , most likely by increasing the pool of G - actin available to formin . Importantly , a minimal level of proﬁlin is required for formin Cdc12 - mediated contractile ring assembly , as inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex does not suppress cdc3 - 124 cytokinesis defects at the fully restrictive temperature of 36 (cid:3) C ( Figures 6A and 6F ) ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1996 ) . Furthermore , suppression is speciﬁc to proﬁlin mutant cdc3 - 124 cells , as other contractile ring mutants including formin cdc12 - 112 , myosin light chain cdc4 - 8 and tropomyosin cdc8 - 27 are not sup - pressed by inhibiting Arp2 / 3 complex at 33 . 5 (cid:3) C ( Table S1 ) ( Bala - subramanian et al . , 1996 ) . DISCUSSION Here , and in an accompanying paper using animal ﬁbroblast cells ( Rotty et al . , 2014 , in this issue of Developmental Cell ) , we discovered that proﬁlin is not simply a housekeeping G - actin binding protein that similarly facilitates actin assembly by diverse actin assembly factors .

Although proﬁlin slows nucleation by formins ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ; Li and Higgs , 2003 ; Paul and Pollard , 2008 ; Pring et al . , 2003 ) , once ﬁlaments are formed proﬁlin increases their elonga - tion rate as much as 10 - fold faster than the rate of free barbed ends assembled by Arp2 / 3 complex ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Romero et al . , 2004 ) . This results in fewer ﬁlaments that elongate quickly . Additionally , formins remain continuously associated on growing barbed ends ( Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ) , allowing rapid elongation in the presence of capping protein ( Zigmond et al . , 2003 ) . Conversely , proﬁlin signiﬁcantly reduces Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated branch formation by inhibiting the association of its activator WASP VCA with actin ( see Figure 3 ) ( Egile et al . , 1999 ; Higgs et al . , 1999 ; Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Rodal et al . , 2003 ) , and proﬁlin does not increase the elongation rate of Arp2 / 3 complex - nucleated ﬁlaments . Furthermore , ﬁlaments with free barbed ends produced by Arp2 / 3 complex are rapidly capped by capping protein ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore , the combination of proﬁlin and capping protein dramatically favors formin over Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 5J and 5K ) . These opposing effects of proﬁlin allow formin to assemble F - actin networks by efﬁciently competing with Arp2 / 3 complex for G - actin . Signiﬁcantly , ﬁssion yeast cells expressing the proﬁ - lin separation of function mutant SpPRF ( Y5D ) , which binds to G - actin and inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex but cannot bind to formin , fail cytokinesis . Conversely , cytokinesis defects in proﬁlin mutant cdc3 - 124 cells are suppressed by inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex . Therefore , both enhancing formin and suppressing Arp2 / 3 complex are important functions of proﬁlin . How does proﬁlin inhibit Arp2 / 3 complex ? Activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by WASP and subsequent branch formation requires multiple steps ( Pollard , 2007 ) : ( 1 ) Arp2 / 3 complex binds two WASP molecules , each associated with an actin monomer ( Padrick et al . , 2011 ; Ti et al . , 2011 ) , ( 2 ) the WASP - actin - Arp2 / 3 complex associates with a mother ﬁlament ( Smith et al . , 2013 ) , ( 3 ) Arp2 / 3 complex adopts an active conformation resembling a short - pitch actin dimer ( Goley et al . , 2010 ; Rouil - ler et al . , 2008 ) , ( 4 ) WASP delivers and helps position the ﬁrst and second actin subunits of the daughter ﬁlament ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Marchand et al . , 2001 ; Padrick et al . , 2011 ) , ( 5 ) WASP dissociates from a nascent actin branch ( Smith et al . , 2013 ) , and ( 6 ) new actin monomers are added to the barbed end of the Arp2 / 3 complex nucleus . Proﬁlin might theoretically modify several steps in actin branch formation . However , based on experimental evidence , we favor a simple hypothesis that proﬁlin and WASP compete for actin monomers ( Mache - sky et al . , 1999 ; Rodal et al . , 2003 ) . First , both human and ﬁssion yeast WASP and proﬁlin cannot bind actin monomers simultaneously ( Figures 3E – 3H ) ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) . Second , the proﬁlin SpPRF ( K81E ) mutant does not inhibit the associationofWASPwithG - actin ( Figure3H ) anddoesnotinhibit Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 3B ) . By competing with VCA for binding actin monomers , proﬁlin prevents the delivery of the ﬁrst actin subunit to the daughter ﬁlament , thereby blocking branch forma - tion . Wealsofoundthatproﬁlinslightlydisruptstheassociationof WASP with Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 3C and 3D ) , so we cannot fully rule out that proﬁlin might also disrupt the association of the WASP - G - actin complex with Arp2 / 3 complex or sterically hinder Arp2 / 3 complex activation by binding Arp2 ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . On the other hand , we can rule out the importance of proﬁlin binding directly to WASP because ( 1 ) proﬁlin similarly inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex activation by WASP fragments with or without the proline - rich domain ( Figures S4C – S4E ) , and ( 2 ) the proﬁlin SpPRF ( Y5D ) mutant inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex as well as WT SpPRF . Interestingly , proﬁlin also inhibits formin - mediated nucleation ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ; Li and Higgs , 2003 ; Paul and Pollard , 2008 ; Pring et al . , 2003 ) , suggesting that a general role of proﬁlin is to limit the nucleation step of actin assembly , even by nucleation factors . The role of proﬁlin as a regulator of homeostatic F - actin networks may be evolutionarily conserved . Modifying proﬁlin levels alters speciﬁc F - actin networks in diverse cell types . Reducing proﬁlin levels often leads to defects speciﬁcally in formin - mediated processes such as cytokinesis in diverse cells including ﬁssion yeast , worms , and mice ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1994 ; Severson et al . , 2002 ; Witke et al . , 2001 ) . Conversely , increased proﬁlin levels often lead to the disap - pearance of Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated networks such as lamellipodia in animal cells ( Cao et al . , 1992 ) , Listeria actin comet tails ( Sanger et al . , 1995 ) , or actin patches in yeast ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1994 ) . Similarly , Rotty et al . ( 2014 ) found that proﬁlin antagonizes Arp2 / 3 complex in animal ﬁbro - blasts . We suspect that the spatial and temporal regulation of proﬁlin may be a key molecular switch that allows assembly of diverse F - actin networks via different actin assembly factors .

Cartoon Model for Proﬁlin’s Role in Regulating F - Actin Network Homeostasis The majority of G - actin in cells is bound to proﬁlin , which helps distribute actin assembly between diverse F - actin networks . Proﬁlin inhibits nucle - ation by formin but dramatically increases the elongation rate of formin - associated ﬁla - ments . Proﬁlin inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated daughter branch formation by disrupting the as - sociation of its activator WASP VCA with actin , but has little effect on their elongation rate . Further - more , formin - associated ﬁlaments continue to elongate in the presence of capping protein , whereas Arp2 / 3 complex - branched ﬁlaments are rapidly capped . Therefore , proﬁlin is necessary for formin to rapidly assemble unbranched actin ﬁla - ments in the presence of excess Arp2 / 3 complex . 8 Developmental Cell 32 , 1 – 11 , January 12 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc .

Higher eukaryotic cells with multiple proﬁlin isoforms might have particular isoforms expressed at a partic - ular time and place , and / or tailored to facilitate actin assembly for different F - actin networks ( Mouneimne et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , phosphorylation of proﬁlin ( Fan et al . , 2012 ) , and / or release of proﬁlin’s inhibitory association with mem - brane phosphoinositides ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1991 ) , might also affect the spatial and temporal regulation of actin assembly by formins and the Arp2 / 3 complex . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Fission Yeast Strain Construction and Assay Conditions Fission yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table S2 . Cells were maintained on standard YE5S complete and EMM5S minimal growth media . All strains combining two or more markers and / or mutants were constructed by genetic crosses and tetrad dissection . To overexpress proﬁlin , the endogenous Pcdc3 promoter was replaced with the thiamine - repressible 3xPnmt1 promoter by integrating pFA6a - kanMX6 - P3nmt1 cassette ( Ba¨hler et al . , 1998 ) in place of (cid:4) 1 to (cid:4) 140 nucleotide region in the 5 0 UTR of the endogenous cdc3 locus . For data in Figure S1 , proﬁlin was overexpressed from the high expression vector pREP3x - cdc3 , which was transformed by lithium acetate into WT cells or cells O . E . actin ( Burke et al . , 2014 ) . Stock solutions of 10 mM CK - 666 ( Sigma ) were prepared in DMSO ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ) . Seven hundred microliters of exponentially growing cells were treated with DMSO or 50 m M CK - 666 , incubated at 25 (cid:3) C , 33 . 5 (cid:3) C , or 36 (cid:3) C and then imaged each hour with differential interference contrast and epiﬂuorescence microscopy . Aliquots were ﬁxed in MeOH and labeled with DAPI and Calcoﬂuor to stain nuclei and septa . For actin patch tracking in cdc3 - 124 cells , cells were grown for 4 hours at 25 (cid:3) C or 36 (cid:3) C in the presence orabsenceofCK - 666 , andthenimaged . StrainsexpressingWTormutantpro - ﬁlins were generated by integration of pJK148 - SpPRF constructs into leu1 - 32 locus of cdc3 - 124 cells . In these strains , proﬁlin expression is under control of the 81xPnmt1 promoter that was induced by growing cells for 26 hr in EMM5S without thiamine . Cells were grown for an additional 2 hours at 36 (cid:3) C for actin patch tracking , and for an additional 2 hours at 33 . 5 (cid:3) C for contractile ring tracking . Actin and proﬁlin overexpression strains were grown in YE5S at 25 (cid:3) Cfor 24 hr , thengrown inEMM5S without thiamine at 25 (cid:3) C for 22 hrbefore imaging . Cell Imaging ConfocalimageswerecollectedwithaCascade512BTcamera ( Photometrics ) on a Zeiss Axioimager M1 equipped with 63 3 , 1 . 4 numerical aperture oil - immersion lens and a Yokogawa CSU - X1 spinning - disk unit ( Solamere ) with a Tempcontrol - 37 objective heater ( Zeiss ) . z Stacks were acquired with a 100 3 , 1 . 4 NA objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M equipped with a Yokogawa CSU - 10 spinning - disk unit ( McBain ) illuminated with a 50 - mW 473 - nm DPSS laser , and a Cascade 512B EM - CCD camera ( Photometrics ) controlled by MetaMorph software ( Molecular Devices ) . Differential interference contrast and epiﬂuorescence images were collected using an Orca - ER camera ( Hamamatsu ) on an IX - 81 microscope ( Olympus ) equipped with a Plan Apo 60 3 / NA 1 . 4 NA objective . WT , actin , and proﬁlin overexpressing cells in Fig - ure 1 were imaged on pads of 25 % gelatin in EMM5S using UltraView VoX ( PerkinElmer ) spinningdiskconfocalsystemequippedwithC9100 - 50EMCCD camera ( Hamamatsu ) , installed on a Nikon Ti - E microscope with a 100 3 / 1 . 4 NA Plan Apo lens , and controlled by Volocity software . Actin patch dynamics were analyzed using ImageJ and the plugin TrackMate from the program Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . At least ten patches for each strain were measured for ﬂuorescence intensity and distance traveled from the cell cortex over time . Timecourses forindividual patcheswere alignedtotheinitiationofpatch movement ( time 0 in Figures 1H and 2C ) or peak intensity ( in Figure 2B ) and averaged at each time point . TIRF Microscopy Microscope slides ( no . 1 . 5 , Fisher Scientiﬁc ) were coated with mPEG - Silane ( Winkelman et al . , 2014 ) . TIRF microscopy images of Oregon green - labeled actin ( 488 nm ) , TMR - labeled actin ( 561 nm ) , and SNAP - 549 ( red ) - SpCdc12 ( FH1 1P FH2 ) ( 561 nm ) were collected at 10 s intervals with an iXon EMCCD camera ( Andor Technology ) using an Olympus IX - 71 micro - scopeequippedwiththrough - the - objective TIRFMillumination . Mg - ATP - actin ( 1 . 5 m M , 15 % Oregon green - actin or 15 % TMR - actin ) was mixed with other proteins in a polymerization mix containing 10 mM Imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 50 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 50 m M CaCl 2 , 15 mM glucose , 20 m g / ml catalase , 100 m g / ml glucose oxidase , and 0 . 5 % ( wt / vol ) methylcellulose 400 centipoise to induce assembly , and transferred to a ﬂow cell ( Winkelman et al . , 2014 ) . For biomimetic assays , carboxylated 2 m m microspheres ( Polysciences ) were coated with either 2 m M of GST - pWA or formin SNAP - mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) and introduced into the polymerization mix .
