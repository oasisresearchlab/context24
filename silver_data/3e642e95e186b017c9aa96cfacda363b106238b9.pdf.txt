We tested the hypothesis that the albumin - docking protein gp60 , which is localized in caveolae , couples to the heterotrimeric GTP binding protein G i , and thereby activates plasmalemmal vesicle formation and the directed migration of vesicles in endothelial cells ( ECs ) . We used the water - soluble styryl pyridinium dye N - ( 3 - triethylaminopropyl ) - 4 - ( p - dibutylaminostyryl ) pyridinium dibromide ( FM 1 - 43 ) to quantify vesicle traf - ﬁcking by confocal and digital ﬂuorescence microscopy . FM 1 - 43 and ﬂuorescently labeled anti - gp60 antibody ( Ab ) were colocalized in endocytic vesicles within 5 min of gp60 activation . Vesicles migrated to the basolateral surface where they released FM 1 - 43 , the ﬂuid phase styryl probe . FM 1 - 43 ﬂuorescence disappeared from the basolateral EC surface without the loss of anti - gp60 Ab ﬂuorescence . Activation of cell - surface gp60 by cross - linking ( using anti - gp60 Ab and secondary Ab ) in EC grown on microporous ﬁlters increased transendo - thelial 125 I - albumin permeability without altering liquid permeability ( hydraulic conductivity ) , thus , indicating the dissociation of hydraulic conductivity from the albu - min permeability pathway . The ﬁndings that the sterol - binding agent , ﬁlipin , prevented gp60 - activated vesicle formation and that caveolin - 1 and gp60 were colocal - ized in vesicles suggest the caveolar origin of endocytic vesicles . Pertussis toxin pretreatment and expression of the dominant negative construct encoding an 11 – amino acid G a i carboxyl - terminal peptide inhibited endothelial 125 I - albumin endocytosis and vesicle formation induced by gp60 activation . Expression of dominant negative Src ( dn - Src ) and overexpression of wild - type caveolin - 1 also prevented gp60 - activated endocytosis . Caveolin - 1 over - expression resulted in the sequestration of G a i with the caveolin - 1 , whereas dn - Src inhibited G a i binding to ca - veolin - 1 . Thus , vesicle formation induced by gp60 and migration of vesicles to the basolateral membrane re - quires the interaction of gp60 with caveolin - 1 , followed by the activation of the downstream G i - coupled Src ki - nase signaling pathway . Key words : transcytosis • endocytosis • caveolae • microvascular endothelial cells • albumin permeability Introduction Albumin is the primary plasma protein that maintains the colloid osmotic pressure gradient across the semi - permeable microvascular endothelial barrier and , hence , the plasma in - terstitial albumin concentration gradient is critical in regulat - ing tissue fluid balance ( for review see Lum and Malik , 1994 ) . A transcellular pathway through endothelial cells has been implicated in the transport of albumin ( Ghitescu et al . , 1986 ; Milici et al . , 1987 ; Shasby and Peterson , 1987 ; Michel , 1992 ) , lipids , hormones , peptides , and drugs that bind avidly to albu - min ( Peters , 1975 ; Partridge , 1979 ; Forker and Luxton , 1983 ) . The endothelial cell surface 60 - kD glycoprotein , gp60 1 or al - bondin ( Schnitzer et al . , 1988 ; Ghinea et al . , 1989 ; Schnitzer and Oh , 1994 ; Tiruppathi et al . , 1996 ) , is believed to be im - portant in the mechanism of albumin binding and activation of transcellular albumin transport via vesicles . Albumin can also cross the endothelial barrier via a diffusional - convective paracellular pathway ( Lum and Malik , 1994 ) . Inflammatory Address correspondence to Asrar B .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 150 , 2000 1058 mediators such as thrombin and histamine increase endothe - lial albumin permeability by increasing the size of interen - dothelial clefts ( Majno et al . , 1969 ; Garcia et al . , 1986 ; Del Vecchio et al . , 1987 ; Qiao et al . 1995 ; Rabiet et al . , 1996 ) . We purified gp60 from pulmonary microvascular endo - thelial cells and showed it could bind specifically and in a saturable manner to albumin ( Tiruppathi et al . , 1996 ) . We also showed that activation of the cell - surface gp60 using a cross - linking antibody ( Ab ) induced the transendothelial flux of albumin ( Tiruppathi et al . , 1997 ) . Inhibitor studies suggested the increased albumin flux involved the activa - tion of Src family tyrosine kinases that phosphorylated ca - veolin - 1 and gp60 ( Tiruppathi et al . , 1997 ) . Formation of vesicles induced by gp60 was inhibited by the tyrosine ki - nase inhibitors , herbimycin A and genistein ( Tiruppathi et al . , 1997 ; Niles and Malik , 1999 ) . Trafficking of vesicles to the basolateral membrane in endothelial cells also required the N - ethylmaleimide – sensitive fusion factor ( NSF ) and soluble NSF attachment protein receptor ( Niles and Malik , 1999 ) . The heterotrimeric GTP binding protein , G i , binds to caveolin - 1 in the caveolar membrane ( Li et al . , 1995 ; Oka - moto et al . , 1998 ) and activates Src kinases ( Luttrell et al . , 1996 ; Igishi and Gutkind , 1998 ; Ellis et al . , 1999 ) , which also bind to caveolin - 1 ( Li et al . , 1996 ) . Since gp60 is local - ized in the caveolar membrane ( Schnitzer and Oh , 1994 ) and is capable of activating Src family tyrosine kinases ( Tiruppathi et al . , 1997 ) , we addressed the possible role of the G a i - coupled Src kinase pathway in gp60 - activated sig - naling vesicle formation and trafficking in endothelial cells . Materials and Methods Antibodies gp60 Ab was prepared as described previously ( Tiruppathi et al . ( 1996 ) . Polyclonal anti - gp60 Ab was labeled with the Cy3 bisfunctional reactive dye ( Tiruppathi et al . , 1997 ) . Monoclonal and polyclonal anti – caveolin - 1 antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories . Rabbit - anti - G a i polyclonal Ab recognizing the carboxyl - terminal region of isoforms 1 and 2 ( KNNLKDCGLF ) was purchased from Calbiochem . Goat anti – rab - bit and anti – mouse IgG labeled with rhodamine , FITC , Alexa 568 , or Al - exa 488 and BSA - Alexa 488 conjugate were purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories and Molecular Probes , Inc . Fluorescent Probes We used fluorescent water - soluble styryl pyridinium dyes N - ( 3 - trieth - ylaminopropyl ) - 4 - ( p - dibutylaminostyryl ) pyridinium dibromide ( FM 1 - 43 ) and N - ( 3 - triethylammoniumpropyl ) - 4 - ( 4 - ( 4 - ( diethylamino ) phenyl ) buta - dienyl ) pyridinium dibromide ( RH 414 ; Molecular Probes , Inc . ) to label plasmalemma - derived vesicles ( Niles and Malik , 1999 ) . Stock solutions of 5 mg / ml were prepared in DMSO and stored in a desiccator at 2 80 8 C for up to 1 mo . Cell staining solutions ( 5 m g / ml ) were made in HBSS contain - ing 20 mM Hepes , 2 mM Ca 2 1 , and 2 mM Mg 2 1 . Staining solutions and subsequent washing buffer contained fixed BSA concentration ( 6 mg / ml ; fraction V , 99 % pure , endotoxin - free ; Sigma Chemical Co . ) . Albumin Iodination BSA was labeled with Na 125 I ( New England Nuclear ) using the chloramine T procedure ( Bocci , 1964 ) . Free iodine - 125 , separated from 125 I - albumin with a Sephadex G25 column , constituted , 0 . 3 % of the total radioactivity . Endothelial Cell ( EC ) Cultures Bovine lung microvessel ECs ( BLMVEC ) were isolated and cultured in high glucose DME ( GIBCO BRL ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Hy - clone ) , 5 mM glutamine , 50 U / ml penicillin , and 50 m g / ml streptomycin ( Del Vecchio et al . , 1992 ) . Endothelial cell cultures were maintained in an incubator at 37 8 C in 5 % CO 2 / 95 % room air . Plasmid DNA Preparations Wild - type ( wt ) caveolin - 1 was prepared from human umbilical vein ECs endothelial cells by reverse transcription – PCR ( RT - PCR ) . The sequenced RT - PCR product was identical to human caveolin - 1 . The RT - PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA3 . 1 ( Invitrogen ) and used for transfection stud - ies . Dominant negative Src ( dn - Src ) ( Y527F , K295M ) and wt - Src in vector pSM were obtained from Dr . Silvio Gutkind ( National Institute of Dental Research , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . G a i and G a q dom - inant negative minigenes encoding the 11 – amino acid carboxyl terminus of G a i ( IKNNLKDCGLF ) or G a q ( LQLNLKEYNAV ; Gilchrist et al . , 1998 ) were ligated into pcDNA3 . 1 plasmid vector . A minigene encoding a scram - bled sequence of G a i ( NGIKCLSNDKL ) was used as a negative control . Green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) plasmid DNA ( plasmid pGREEN LAN - TERN - 1 ) was purchased from GIBCO BRL . 125 I - Albumin Endocytosis Endocytosis of 125 I - albumin was measured as described previously ( Tirup - pathi et al . , 1997 ) . BLMVEC were grown to confluence in either 6 - or 12 - well culture plates . Monolayers were washed twice with 10 mM Hepes - buff - ered DME , pH 7 . 4 , and the uptake of 125 I - albumin was carried out for 25 min at 37 8 C . Endocytosis was terminated by placing EC monolayers on ice and washing three times with either pH 2 . 5 buffer ( 0 . 2 M acetic acid and 0 . 5 M NaCl ) or pH 3 . 0 buffer ( 20 mM glycine - HCl and 0 . 15 M NaCl ) to remove the surface - bound 125 I - albumin ( Tiruppathi et al . , 1992 ) . Cells were lysed with 50 mM Tris - HCl buffer , pH 7 . 4 , containing 1 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 5 % SDS , and the lysate was used to measure endocytosis of 125 I - albumin . Transendothelial 125 I - Albumin Permeability Transendothelial 125 I - BSA permeability of BLMVEC monolayers grown on microporous polycarbonate transwell filter inserts ( Corning Costar Corp . ) was measured as previously described ( Del Vecchio et al . , 1987 ; Siflinger - Birnboim et al . , 1988 ) . Endothelial Monolayer Hydraulic Conductivity ( L p ) Confluent BLMVEC on gelatin - coated microporous polycarbonate filters were used to measure transendothelial fluid flux using the two - compart - ment system ( Qiao et al . , 1993 ) . Both upper and lower chambers were filled with 0 . 5 % albumin in HBSS , pH 7 . 4 , at 37 8 C and sealed with rubber stoppers . Constant flow perfusion was used to renew the luminal fluid ev - ery minute and to prevent an increase in osmolarity . Hydrostatic pressure in the upper chamber was controlled by adjusting the height of the out - flow tubing . The filtrate was collected in 1 - min intervals and the filtration rate per unit surface ( Jv [ 3 10 - 6 ml / cm 2 / s ] ) was calculated by measuring the timed movement of fluid meniscus in the collecting tubing . The filtration rate at the two given pressures ( P 1 5 0 cm H 2 O and P 2 5 5 cm H 2 O ) at 20 - min intervals was measured for up to 2 h . The L p was calculated as ( Qiao et al . , 1993 ) . Cell - surface gp60 Cross - linking BLMVEC monolayers were washed twice with Hepes - buffered DME ( at 4 8 C ) and incubated with 10 m g / ml of anti - gp60 Ab , followed by 10 m g / ml of a secondary Ab ( goat anti – rabbit ) for 30 min at 4 8 C ( Tiruppathi et al . , 1997 ) . After treatment , the cells were rewarmed to 37 8 C for the experiments . Styryl Pyridinium Dye Uptake Endocytosis in endothelial cells was quantified as described previously ( Niles and Malik , 1999 ) using the styryl pyridinium dyes , FM 1 - 43 and RH 414 . In brief , 5 3 10 4 BLMVEC were plated on 25 - mm - diam No . 1 cover - slips or Lab - tek chamber slides ( Nalge Nunc Intl . ) coated with 0 . 1 % gela - tin . Cells were incubated in buffered medium containing 5 m g / ml FM 1 - 43 or RH 414 at 37 8 C for 15 min , and then washed three times in ice - cold HBSS . As styryl pyridinium dyes fluoresce brightly at the membrane – water interface ( Betz et al . , 1992 ) , FM 1 - 43 fluorescence associated with the cells after washing cell surface probe was the result of incorporation of FM 1 - 43 into plasmalemma - derived vesicles . Jv 1 Jv 2 – ( ) P 1 P 2 – ( ) ⁄ Minshall et al . Gp60 - activated Endothelial Permeability 1059 Digital Fluorescent Microscopy Live cell fluorescent imaging was performed with an inverted Nikon mi - croscope as previously described ( Niles and Malik , 1999 ) . Fluorescence and differential interference contrast images were recorded for each cell field with a cooled integrating charge - coupled device camera ( Imagepoint ; Photometrics ) . Quantitative analysis of images ( median cell brightness and the number of particles per cell ) was performed using Image Pro Plus soft - ware with custom written functions as previously described ( Niles and Malik , 1999 ) . Data expressed as median cell brightness or number of par - ticles per cell were consistent within each treatment . Colocalization of gp60 and FM 1 - 43 Confluent BLMVEC on coverslips were incubated for 15 min at 37 8 C in a mixture of 5 m g / ml FM 1 - 43 and 5 m g / ml Cy3 - conjugated anti - gp60 Ab in HBSS plus 10 mg / ml BSA to colabel cytosolic vesicles . Cells were washed quickly three times with ice - cold HBSS containing 10 mg / ml albumin to re - move external FM 1 - 43 and three times for 5 min each with ice - cold pH 5 . 0 buffer ( 0 . 1 M NaCl plus 0 . 05 M sodium acetate ) to remove Cy3 - labeled anti - gp60 Ab attached to cell - surface gp60 . The cells were warmed to 37 8 C for 5 or 45 min to allow the colabeled vesicles to migrate . Cells were viewed by laser scanning confocal microscopy ( laser scanning microscope [ LSM ] 410 and 510 ; Carl Zeiss ) in sequential optical sections . The section plane was ad - vanced in 0 . 1 - m m increments through the cell from the apical to the basolat - eral side . At each optical plane , the specimen was scanned at 488 nm to ex - cite FM 1 - 43 and then at 568 nm to excite Cy3 ( argon / krypton laser ) . FM 1 - 43 ( green ) and Cy3 ( red ) images were overlaid and analyzed for coincident red and green pixels ( thus the colocalized fluorescence was in yellow ) .

( e ) 15 - min incubation with FM 1 - 43 at 4 8 C ( to inhibit endocytosis ) prevents fluorescent dye internal - ization . Other details are described in Materials and Methods . Identical results were observed with the chemically similar styryl dye , RH 414 ( as shown in Fig . 8 and Fig . 9 ) ; thus , FM 1 - 43 and RH 414 dyes were used interchangeably to label endocytic vesicles . Results are representative of five experiments . Bar , 20 m m . and plasmalemmal vesicles of endothelial cells exposed to albumin or gp60 cross - linking ( described above ) was determined by immunocytochemical labeling and laser scanning confocal microscopy ( Zeiss LSM 210 and 510 ) . BLMVEC were serum - deprived for 24 h , washed three times with Hepes - buffered HBSS or phenol red - free DME , and exposed to 6 mg / ml BSA in the presence or absence of 50 m g / ml Alexa 488 – conjugated BSA and / or 3 . 5 m g / ml cy3 - anti - gp60 Ab for up to 30 min . Cells were either washed three times with HBSS and imaged live , or fixed with 4 % paraformalde - hyde in HBSS and blocked for 30 min in HBSS containing 5 % goat serum , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 0 . 01 % NaN 3 . Primary Ab labeling was performed overnight at 4 8 C with anti – caveolin - 1 mAb ( 1 m g / ml ) , polyclonal anti - G a i Ab ( 1 : 100 dilution ) , or 20 m g / ml anti - gp60 IgG . Coverslips were washed three times for 10 min in HBSS , blocked for 30 min with 5 % goat serum , and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with fluorescently labeled goat anti – rabbit and goat anti – mouse Ab . In some cases , 4 9 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phe - nylindole , dihydrochloride ( DAPI ; 1 m g / ml ) was added to visualize the nu - cleus . Confocal microscopy was performed using 364 - , 488 - , and 568 - nm excitation laser lines to detect DAPI ( BP385 - 470 nm emission ) , FITC / Al - exa 488 ( BP505 - 550 emission ) , and rhodamine / Alexa 568 fluorescence ( LP585 emission ) in optical sections , 1 m m in thickness ( pinhole set to achieve 1 Airy unit ) . Pertussis Toxin Treatment Confluent BLMVEC were incubated in DME containing 100 ng / ml per - tussis toxin for 6 h at 37 8 C . Control cells were incubated in toxin - free me - dium for 6 h before labeling with the styryl dye . Filipin Treatment Confluent BLMVEC were serum - deprived for 24 h and pretreated with 50 nM filipin ( 25 ng / ml ) for 30 min at 37 8 C . Control cells were incubated with serum - and phenol red – free DME containing vehicle DMSO ( 0 . 005 % DMSO ) . Plasmid Transfection Studies Expression of G a i minigene , wt - caveolin - 1 , and dn - Src . BLMVEC were grown to 50 % confluence in 60 - mm - diam plates and transfected using Ef - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 150 , 2000 1060 fectene ( QIAGEN Inc . ) according to manufacturer’s protocol . Plasmid DNA – Effectene complexes containing either 0 . 25 m g / ml vector alone , wt - caveolin - 1 , wt - Src , dn - Src , dn - PKC a , or G a i - , G a q - , or G a - random se - quence minigene constructs were incubated with 0 . 25 m g / ml GFP ( GIBCO BRL ) in DME containing 10 % FBS . The transfection mixture was re - moved after 6 h and fresh media containing 10 % FBS was applied . At 24 h after transfection , cells were trypsinized and transferred to either multi - well Lab - tek chambers for styryl pyridinium dye uptake studies , to 35 - mm - diam wells for obtaining cell lysates , or to 12 mm - diam No . 1 glass coverslips for immunostaining . Cells were allowed to grow for an addi - tional 24 h , and then used for experiments ( 48 h after transfection ) . Trans - fection efficiency was . 30 % . Coimmunoprecipitation of Caveolin - 1 and gp60 Confluent BLMVEC in 60 - mm - diam culture dishes were kept in serum - free medium overnight and metabolically labeled with 200 m Ci / ml 32 P - orthophosphate for 4 h . Cells were stimulated for 20 min with 6 mg / ml BSA and lysed ( 30 min at 4 8 C in 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , containing 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 25 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 . 0 % NP - 40 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 mM NaF , 2 m g / ml leupeptin , 2 m g / ml pepstatin A , 2 m g / ml aprotinin , and 44 m g / ml PMSF ) . Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation ( 13 , 000 g for 15 min ) before overnight immunoprecipita - tion with preimmune IgG ( 10 m g / ml ) , anti - gp60 Ab ( 10 m g / ml ) , or poly - clonal anti – caveolin - 1 Ab ( 1 m g / ml ) at 4 8 C . Protein A or G agarose beads were added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at 4 8 C . Immunoprecipi - Figure 2 .

Colocalization and migration of gp60 and plas - malemma - derived vesicles . ( a ) Cy3 - labeled anti - gp60 Ab was used to fluorescently tag gp60 in BLMVEC incubated in 10 mg / ml BSA . Endo - somes were labeled at the same time with 5 m g / ml FM 1 - 43 to show colocalization of vesicles with gp60 . After coincubation with both probes for the indicated times , cell - surface fluores - cence was removed by exten - sive rinsing with pH 5 . 0 buffer at 4 8 C .

Plot gives relative colocalized fluorescence intensity versus depth of the optical section through the endothelial cell . Peak fluorescent intensity occurred near the luminal cell surface at 5 min after co - labeling , whereas the peak is shifted towards the basolateral sur - face at 45 min . The peak colocalized fluorescence intensity de - creased at 45 min compared with 5 min because of exocytosis of FM 1 - 43 and dilution of its fluorescence in extracellular fluid . Results are representative of five experiments . Minshall et al . Gp60 - activated Endothelial Permeability 1061 washes , membranes were incubated at 22 8 C with HRP - conjugated goat anti – rabbit Ab . After incubation , membranes were washed twice , and protein bands were localized by incubating with enhanced chemilumines - cence reagent ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) . Statistical Analysis Statistical comparisons were made using the t test with the significance level set at P , 0 . 05 . Results Activation of gp60 Induces Plasmalemmal Vesicle Formation The cellular distribution of gp60 was determined after in - cubating confluent endothelial cells for 30 min with Cy3 - conjugated anti - gp60 Ab . We observed punctate distribu - tion of fluorescence after incubation of the probe at 37 8 C , followed by cold ( 4 8 C ) wash buffer to remove the cell sur - face – bound Cy3 probe ( Fig . 1 a ) . To visualize internalized gp60 , cell - surface fluorescence was removed by an acid wash . The resultant image showed that gp60 was internal - ized during the incubation period ( Fig . 1 b ) . Reduction of the temperature to 4 8 C followed by a low pH wash pre - vented the gp60 internalization ( Fig . 1 c ) . Endothelial cell monolayers were incubated with styryl pyridinium dye , FM 1 - 43 ( 5 m g / ml ) , for 15 min at 37 8 C , and then rinsed with dye - free buffer to visualize plasma - lemma - derived endocytic vesicles . Endothelial cells incu - bated in FM 1 - 43 exhibited the punctate distribution of fluorescence characteristic of vesicles ( Fig . 1 d ) . Vesicle formation was inhibited when cells were kept at 4 8 C dur - ing the dye loading period ( Fig . 1 e ) . To determine the effects of gp60 cross - linking on vesicle formation , BLMVEC were incubated with either anti - gp60 Ab or preimmune IgG ( control Ab ) for 30 min at 4 8 C followed by anti - rabbit secondary Ab for 30 min at 4 8 C . Cells were exposed to FM 1 - 43 for 15 min at 37 8 C , mem - brane - bound dye was washed , and intracellular FM 1 - 43 fluorescence was quantified as median brightness of cells and the number of fluorescent particles per cell . The gp60 cross - linking produced 2 . 0 – 3 . 8 - fold increases in cell fluo - rescence by either measure compared with controls ( Fig . 2 ) . Activation of gp60 Induces Transcellular Migration of Plasmalemma - derived Vesicles To determine the fate of gp60 and of vesicles formed by gp60 activation , FM 1 - 43 – labeled vesicles were colocalized with the Cy3 - conjugated anti - gp60 Ab . Cells were washed with acid buffer to detach Cy3 - anti - gp60 Ab from the cell surface before imaging . Confocal images of each fluores - cent probe were obtained at 0 . 1 - m m z - axis step increments from the apical to basolateral cell membrane . Colocaliza - tion was determined by merging red ( Cy3 fluorescence ) and green images ( Fig . 3 a ; FM 1 - 43 fluorescence ) . Al - though FM 1 - 43 labels all plasmalemmal - derived vesicles , a fraction of these vesicles were colocalized ( yellow ) with the fluorescently labeled gp60 Ab . To follow the migration of plasmalemma - derived vesi - cles , endothelial cells were colabeled with fluorescent anti - gp60 Ab and FM 1 - 43 for 15 min at 37 8 C , washed ( 4 8 C ) , and rewarmed ( 37 8 C ) for either 5 or 45 min to activate the ves - Figure 4 . Gp60 activation increases transendothelial flux of 125 I - albumin without increasing barrier hydraulic conductivity . ( a ) BLMVEC monolayers on filters were washed twice with Hepes - DME and incubated with either anti - gp60 Ab or preimmune ( PI ) IgG ( 10 m g / ml ) for 30 min at 22 8 C , followed by treatment with 10 m g / ml goat anti – rabbit secondary Ab for 30 min . Monolayers were used for transendothelial 125 I - albumin permeability mea - surements at 37 8 C . Both luminal and albuminal compartments contained 30 mg / ml of unlabeled albumin . Asterisk indicates the difference from control ( P , 0 . 001 ) . ( b ) Lack of effect of gp60 cross - linking on endothelial monolayer hydraulic conductivity ( L p ) . A system consisting of BLMVEC cultured on filters using the two compartment system was used to measure L p ( Qiao et al . , 1993 ) ; medium albumin concentration was 5 mg / ml . Monolayers were washed and incubated with either anti - gp60 Ab ( to induce gp60 cross - linking ) or preimmune IgG ( 10 m g / ml ) for 10 min , followed by secondary Ab treatment for 5 min . Values are the mean 6 SEM ( n 5 5 ) . tates were gently washed three times with 150 mM Tris - HCl buffer con - taining 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 mM NaF , 2 m g / ml leupeptin , 2 m g / ml pepstatin A , 2 m g / ml aprotinin , and 44 m g / ml PMSF . Immunopre - cipitated proteins were resolved on SDS - PAGE , transferred to Duralose membrane , and visualized by autoradiography . Protein bands were identi - fied by reprobing with either anti - gp60 Ab or anti – caveolin - 1 Ab . Western Blot Analysis BLMVEC lysates ( 10 m g protein was loaded per lane ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE on a 12 % separating gel under reducing conditions and trans - ferred to Duralose membrane . Membranes were blocked with ( 5 % dry milk in 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ) for 2 h at 22 8 C . Membranes were incubated with a 1 : 3 , 000 dilution of polyclonal anti – caveolin - 1 Ab or 0 . 4 m g / ml anti - G a i or G a q Ab at 22 8 C for 3 h . After The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 150 , 2000 1062 icle migration . At 5 min after colabeling , the vesicles that formed during the dye incubation period were lo - cated in the cytosol near the apical plasmalemma ; i . e . , in upper one - third of each cell ( Fig . 3 a , top row ) . At 45 min after colabeling , the vesicles containing gp60 and endocytic marker dye had migrated to the lower half of the cell near the basolateral plasmalemma ( Fig . 3 a , bot - tom row ) . Fig . 3 b shows the colocalization of fluorescence in dif - ferent optical section depths of the cell at either 5 or 45 min after gp60 activation . At 5 min after gp60 activation , the peak colocalized fluorescence ( i . e . , the gp60 - activated vesicles ) was observed , 0 . 5 m m from the apical surface . At 45 min , the peak colocalized fluorescence was shifted toward the basolateral cell surface ( i . e . , at a section depth of 1 . 5 m m ) . Because of the release of styryl dye into the ba - solateral extracellular compartment , the immunofluores - cence intensity of the 45 - min peak was markedly dimin - ished , such that residual immunofluorescence primarily reflected the persistence of gp60 antigen in the basolateral aspect of the cell . Effects of gp60 Activation on Transendothelial 125 I - Albumin Flux and Endothelial Hydraulic Conductivity We measured transendothelial flux of tracer 125 I - albumin and hydraulic conductivity in confluent BLMVEC mono - layers grown on polycarbonate filters to determine gp60 - activated transendothelial albumin permeability and its relationship to liquid permeability . Cross - linking of gp60 at 37 8 C using 10 m g / ml anti - gp60 Ab plus secondary Ab increased transendothelial 125 I - albumin permeability by twofold ( Fig . 4 a ) . However , the increased 125 I - albumin per - meability was dissociated from endothelial monolayer hy - draulic conductivity ( L p ; Fig . 4 b ) . As gp60 activation in - creased transendothelial albumin permeability without increasing water permeability , the results indicate in - creased albumin flux through transcellular pathways .

Coimmunoprecipitation and migration of caveolin - 1 and gp60 . BLMVEC were grown to confluence , serum - deprived over - night , and metabolically labeled for 4 h with 200 m Ci / ml 32 P - orthophosphate . Cells were either stimulated for 20 min with 6 mg / ml BSA ( b ) or not stimulated with BSA ( a ) and lysed . Total cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with preimmune rabbit IgG ( lanes 1 and 4 ) , rab - bit anti - gp60 IgG ( lanes 2 and 5 ) , or rabbit anti – caveolin - 1 IgG ( lanes 3 and 6 ) , separated by SDS - PAGE , transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane , and visualized by autoradiography . As shown in lane 4 ( b ) , the cell lysate that immunoprecipitated with the anti - gp60 Ab also contained a 22 - kD protein , which migrated similarly to that immunoprecipitated with anti – caveolin - 1 Ab ( b , lane 6 ) .

The cells were serum - deprived for 24 h and incubated for 15 min with 6 mg / ml BSA and 5 m g / ml RH 414 .

Bar : ( a ) 10 m m ; ( b ) 2 m m . albumin fluorescent staining is shown in Fig . 5 b . The en face ( x - y ) view of stacked z - plane images ( 22 sections ) showed marked colocalization of gp60 Ab and albumin in the same endocytic vesicles ( Fig . 5 b ) . Gp60 and Caveolin - 1 Interaction We metabolically labeled serum - deprived BLMVEC with 32 P - orthophosphate for 4 h , stimulated with or without 6 mg / ml albumin for 20 min , and prepared the cell lysates for immunoprecipitation to study caveolin - 1 and gp60 in - teractions ( see Materials and Methods ) . Incubation of the cell lysate with control Ab failed to precipitate either gp60 or caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 6 , a and b , lanes 1 and 4 ) . In the absence of albumin , anti - gp60 Ab or anti – caveolin - 1 Ab immuno - precipitates revealed 60 - and 22 - kD proteins ( Fig . 6 a , lane 2 and 3 ) , which corresponded to gp60 and caveolin - 1 , re - spectively . However , in the case of albumin stimulation , anti - gp60 Ab immunoprecipitated 60 - , 36 - , and 22 - kD pro - teins ( Fig . 6 b , lane 5 ) . The 60 - and 22 - kD bands were identified as gp60 and caveolin - 1 , respectively , by Western blotting ( not shown ) . The 36 - kD band may be CD36 , the low density lipoprotein receptor ( Huang et al . , 1991 ; Lisanti et al . , 1994 ; Tiruppathi et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , anti – cave - olin - 1 Ab precipitated caveolin - 1 as well as gp60 in the al - bumin - stimulated cells ( Fig . 6 b , lane 6 ) . Thus , the physical association of gp60 with caveolin - 1 in endothelial cells is facilitated by the activation of gp60 with albumin . Serum - deprived BLMVEC were stimulated with albu - min for 0 , 3 , or 30 min , and were fixed and stained with anti - gp60 and caveolin - 1 Abs to address whether gp60 and ca - veolin - 1 immunostaining comigrated from the apical to basolateral surfaces as a function of albumin exposure . In the absence of albumin , gp60 ( red ) and caveolin - 1 ( green ) immunostaining , which showed a marked overlap ( in yel - low ) , appeared near the apical surface of BLMVEC mono - layers ( Fig . 6 c ) , as seen in the z - axis optical sections ( top left , apical surface ; bottom right , basolateral surface ) . Exposing cells to 6 mg / ml BSA for 3 min ( Fig . 6 d ) or 30 min ( Fig . 6 e ) to activate gp60 induced the internalization and basolateral migration of gp60 . The green fluorescence , which marked caveolin - 1 , did not redistribute towards the basolateral membrane to the same extent as gp60 . In control experi - ments , nonspecific immunofluorescence observed in the presence of preimmune rabbit IgG , control mouse IgG , or with secondary antibodies alone was minimal ; it did not show a pattern of colocalization and also did not change af - ter the exposure of endothelial cell monolayers to albumin . BLMVEC were treated with filipin to determine whether disruption of caveolae influenced albumin uptake induced by gp60 . BLMVEC were incubated in the presence or ab - sence of 50 nM filipin for 30 min at 37 8 C and incubated with anti - gp60 Ab for 30 min at 4 8 C to cross - link gp60 . Cells were incubated with Alexa 488 - BSA for 30 min in media containing 5 mg / ml of unlabeled BSA and acid - washed to remove extracellular label . As shown in Fig . 6 g , filipin prevented the formation of vesicles as compared with control cells ( Fig . 6 f ) . G i Transduces gp60 - activated Vesicle Formation We used three approaches to address the role of G i in the mechanism of gp60 - induced vesicle formation and traffick - ing : ( 1 ) pertussis toxin , which prevents activation of G i / G 0 by ADP ribosylation ( Hepler and Gilman , 1992 ) ; ( 2 ) trans - fection of the dn construct encoding the 11 – amino acid carboxyl - terminal peptide sequence of G a i1 / 2 , which com - petes for G a i – receptor interactions ( Gilchrist et al . , 1998 ) ; and ( 3 ) G a i immunostaining . In control BLMVEC , G a i was localized in the apical membrane ( Fig . 7 a , left ) . Cross - linking of gp60 for 10 min resulted in a decreased apical membrane – associated G a i immunostaining ( Fig . 7 a , right ) . Pretreatment of endothe - lial monolayers with the pertussis toxin prevented both FM 1 - 43 and 125 I - albumin endocytosis induced by gp60 ( Fig . 7 , b and c ) . In addition , the expression of G a i car - boxyl - terminal peptide ( dn - G a i ) in BLMVEC also pre - vented the gp60 - activated vesicle formation as determined by RH 414 uptake in green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) – positive endothelial cells ( Fig . 7 , d and e ) . In control ex - periments , endothelial cells transfected with the G a q mini - gene ( dn - G a q ) or control minigene encoding a randomized sequence of G a i carboxyl terminus ( G a - scr ; Fig . 7 , d and e ) showed the characteristic activation of endocytosis sec - ondary to gp60 stimulation . Expression of Caveolin - 1 and dn - Src Inhibit Vesicle Formation We studied the effects of overexpression of wt - caveolin - 1 since caveolin - 1 can bind to G a i ( Li et al . , 1995 ) and , thus , may functionally inactivate endogenous G a i . Since caveo - lin - 1 and gp60 are phosphorylated by Src family kinases after gp60 activation ( Tiruppathi et al . , 1997 ) , we also studied the role of Src by inducing the expression of dn - Src . Whole cell lysates from BLMVEC transfected with vector alone ( Mock ) , wt - caveolin - 1 ( wt - Cav - 1 ) , or dn - Src were immunoprecipitated with anti – caveolin - 1 Ab , sepa - rated by SDS - PAGE , and blotted with Abs against caveo - lin - 1 , G a i , and G a q ( Fig . 8 ) . The resulting blots showed a twofold increase in expression of caveolin - 1 in cells trans - fected with wt - caveolin - 1 ( lane 2 ) compared with mock - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 150 , 2000 1066 transfected cells ( lane 1 ) . Caveolin - 1 overexpression aug - mented the association of caveolin - 1 with both G a i and G a q ( lane 2 ) , indicating the sequestration of G - proteins with the expressed caveolin - 1 . Expression of dn - Src de - creased the amount of caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 8 , lane 3 , top ) and abolished association of caveolin - 1 with G a i ( Fig . 8 , lane 3 , middle ) , whereas it had no effect on caveolin - 1 association with G a q ( Fig . 8 , lane 3 , bottom panel ) . Thus , the dissocia - tion of G a i from caveolin - 1 induced by dn - Src suggests an important role of Src in regulating the integrity of the ca - veolin - 1 / G a i signaling complex . To determine the effects of caveolin - 1 overexpression and dn - Src expression on gp60 - activated vesicle forma - tion , GFP was co - expressed with wt - caveolin - 1 or dn - Src in BLMVEC , and styryl dye uptake was measured in the GFP - positive cells . Images of GFP - positive cells in the left panels ( Fig . 9 , a , c , and e ) are shown with images of the same field of RH 414 uptake in the right panels ( Fig . 9 , b , d , and f ) . In cells expressing the empty vector ( Fig . 9 a ) , we observed gp60 - activated RH 414 dye uptake ( Fig . 9 b ) . However , overexpression of wt - caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 9 c ) or expression of dn - Src ( Fig . 9 e ) prevented vesicle for - mation ( Fig . 9 , d and f ) in the GFP - positive cells , but not in the nontransfected cells ( ntf ) . As a control for dn - Src , wt - Src and dn - PKC a were co - expressed with GFP in BLMVEC . In these control experiments , we observed the characteristic activation of endocytosis secondary to gp60 activation ( Fig . 9 , g – h ) . Thus , the results show that caveolin - 1 overexpression and dn - Src expression abol - ished gp60 - activated vesicle formation in endothelial cells . Discussion Serum albumin is critical for the maintenance of the nor - mal oncotic pressure gradient across microvessels and for stability of the endothelial barrier ( Michel and Curry , 1999 ) . The endothelial cell monolayer has the capacity to regu - late the directed movement of albumin between its lumi - nal and albumin membrane surface . Transcytosis involves albumin uptake from the vascular space by endocytosis , the vectorial transfer of vesicles from the apical to the ba - solateral membrane , and the release of albumin by exocy - tosis into the subendothelial space . Transcytosis may be physiologically important in regulating the transendothe - lial albumin concentration gradient and transport of albu - min - bound ligands such as hormones , nonesterified fatty acids , and ions . The endothelial cell - surface glycoprotein gp60 , an albu - min - binding protein , has been invoked in the mechanism of albumin transcytosis ( Schnitzer et al . , 1988 ; Ghinea et al . , 1989 ; Schnitzer , 1992 ; Schnitzer and Oh , 1994 ; Tiruppathi et al . , 1996 , 1997 ) . The present study provides new infor - mation on the signal transduction pathways activated by gp60 that induce the formation of vesicles and the targeted mi - gration of vesicles to the basolateral membrane . We showed that upon gp60 activation , gp60 becomes colocalized with albumin and it interacts with caveolin - 1 . Albumin , the gp60 ligand , did not induce the formation of plasmalem - mal - derived vesicles in brain microvessel endothelial cells that lacked gp60 ( Minshall et al . , data not shown ) . Vesicle formation , which was activated by gp60 , required the het - erotrimeric G protein G i , since treatment of cells with per - tussis toxin and expression of an antagonist peptide , which uncouples G a i from its receptor binding site ( Gilchrist et al . , 1998 ) , prevented the budding of vesicles and albumin en - docytosis . Overexpression of wt - caveolin - 1 , which was shown to sequester G a i , and expression of dn - Src also prevented the gp60 - induced vesicle formation by interfering with the G i signaling pathway . The present study demonstrates an important role of gp60 in stimulating endocytosis and the directed migration of vesicles in endothelial cells . Analysis of serial confocal sections showed the apical - to - basolateral migration of ves - icles activated by gp60 in live endothelial cells , which is suggestive of a transcytotic process . We showed that vesic - ular markers ( FM 1 - 43 and RH 414 ) were taken up in the apical membrane – derived , gp60 - positive vesicles , and that the destaining of vesicular markers occurred at the baso - lateral endothelial cell surface . Interestingly , gp60 re - mained localized in the basolateral vesicles after the re - lease of styryl dye , suggesting that gp60 has the potential to recycle to the apical membrane and to reactivate en - docytosis . In addition , we showed that gp60 activation ( with cross - linking Ab ) also increased 125 I - labeled albumin clearance across endothelial monolayers and the transcel - lular migration of styryl pyridinium dye - filled vesicles . Thus , the activation of gp60 - induced transcellular mem - brane traffic was associated with increased transendothe - lial albumin permeability . However , gp60 activation did not change the endothelial barrier L P , suggesting that the interendothelial junctional or paracellular permeability pathway did not increase when albumin transport was stimulated by gp60 . These physiological experiments pro - vide further proof that increased albumin permeability af - ter gp60 activation occurred via a transcellular or nonhy - draulic permeability pathway . Caveolae , the nonclathrin - coated pits that are abundant in vascular endothelial cells , have been implicated in the mechanism of endocytosis ( Lisanti et al . , 1994 ; Anderson , 1998 ) and transcellular permeability ( Milici et al . , 1987 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1994 ; Tiruppathi et al . , 1997 ) . We showed that gp60 and caveolin - 1 , the caveolar structural protein Figure 8 . Effects of caveolin - 1 overexpression and domi - nant negative Src ( dn - Src ) ex - pression on the association of G a i and G a q with caveolin - 1 . BLMVEC transfected with pcDNA3 . 1 alone ( Mock ) ; and wt - caveolin - 1 ( cav - 1 ) or dn - Src was grown to confluence ( 48 h posttransfection ) . Cells were washed and lysed ( see details in Materials and Methods ) , and the lysate was immunoprecipitated using 2 . 5 m g / ml anti – caveolin - 1 Ab . Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE and transferred to the Duralose mem - brane . The membrane was blotted with anti – caveolin - 1 Ab ( top ) , anti - G a i Ab ( middle ) , and anti - G a q Ab ( bottom ) . Representative data from three experiments are shown . Minshall et al . Gp60 - activated Endothelial Permeability 1067 ( Rothberg et al . , 1992 ) , were colocalized in endothelial cell apical plasma membrane – derived vesicles , and that they migrated in the basolateral direction after activation of gp60 . However , caveolin - 1 did not redistribute towards the ba - solateral membrane to the same extent as gp60 , suggesting that gp60 translocates across the cell mainly , though not exclusively , with caveolin - 1 . Immunoprecipitation data showed that gp60 and caveolin - 1 were physically associ - ated after gp60 activation , which is suggestive of a critical interaction between gp60 and caveolin - 1 . Endocytosis of fluorescent albumin was blocked by filipin , a sterol - bind - ing agent that dissembles the cholesterol - rich caveolae ( Rothberg et al . , 1990 , 1992 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1994 ) . Taken together , these data support the concept that gp60 - acti - vated albumin endocytosis occurs by means of vesicles de - rived from caveolae . The budding of vesicles may be the result of dynamin - regulated fission of the caveolar plas - malemmal membrane ( Oh et al . , 1998 ) . Plasmalemmal membrane – derived vesicles have been shown to contain caveolin - 1 , G proteins , G protein – cou - pled receptors , and Src family tyrosine kinases ( Chun et al . , 1994 ; Li et al . , 1996 ; Liu et al . , 1996 ; Murphy et al . , 1996 ; Song et al . , 1997 ; Zacchi et al . , 1998 ; for review see Ander - son , 1998 ) . Caveolin - 1 is known to sequester caveolae - asso - ciated signaling proteins such as Src and G i in their inac - tive form ( Okamoto et al . , 1998 ) . As caveolin - 1 may be involved in gp60 - induced vesicle formation ( Milici et al . , 1987 ; Tiruppathi et al . , 1997 ) , we overexpressed caveolin - 1 Figure 9 . Effects of caveolin - 1 overexpression and dominant negative Src ( dn - Src ) expression on gp60 - induced vesicle forma - tion . BLMVEC cotransfected with GFP and either 0 . 25 m g / ml vector alone , wt - caveolin - 1 , or dn - Src were plated in 4 - well Lab - tek chambers and , at 48 h after transfection , were assayed for RH 414 uptake induced by albumin . Cells were incubated with 5 m g / ml RH 414 for 15 min at 37 8 C , rinsed three times in HBSS ( 4 8 C ) , and whole cell fluo - rescent images of RH 414 were acquired in GFP - positive cells .

( g and h ) Expression of wt - Src or dn - PKC a had no effect on RH 414 uptake . Results are rep - resentative of three to five ex - periments . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 150 , 2000 1068 in endothelial cells and addressed the effects of this inter - vention on vesicle formation after gp60 activation . We ob - served that caveolin - 1 overexpression sequestered G a i and , importantly , it prevented gp60 - activated vesicle for - mation . This finding is consistent with the role of caveolin - 1 in binding ( and thereby in sequestering ) G proteins and other signaling molecules ( Okamoto et al . , 1998 ) . We ad - dressed the possible role of G i in activating gp60 - induced vesicle formation using pertussis toxin ( Hepler and Gilman , 1992 ) and the expression of G a i antagonist peptide ( Gil - christ et al . , 1998 ; Ellis et al . , 1999 ) . As both inhibitors pre - vented gp60 - activated vesicle formation in endothelial cells , the results indicate that G i plays a critical role in transduc - ing the gp60 - induced vesicle formation . Since G i induces the activation of downstream Src ki - nase ( Luttrell et al . , 1996 ; Igishi and Gutkind , 1998 ) , we addressed whether Src kinase was also involved in the gp60 - activated signaling cascade . The results indicated that the expression of dn - Src prevented gp60 - activated vesicle formation in endothelial cells . Interestingly , dn - Src expression also prevented the binding of G a i to caveolin - 1 . As Src kinase and G a i can compete for a common binding domain on caveolin - 1 ( Li et al . , 1996 ; Okamoto et al . , 1998 ) , an explanation for our finding is that binding of dn - Src to caveolin - 1 displaced G a i from caveolin - 1 . This could account for the observation that significantly less G a i coim - munoprecipitated with caveolin - 1 in the cells transfected with dn - Src . The data are consistent with the model that caveo - lin - 1 serves as a scaffolding protein for G i and Src family kinases , which activate the signaling machinery mediating the gp60 - induced vesicular transport . Src family tyrosine kinases activated by receptor dimerization ( Marshall , 1995 ) or by bg subunits upon stimulation of G - protein – coupled receptors ( Luttrell et al . , 1996 ; Igishi and Gutkind , 1998 ) may phosphorylate caveolin - 1 ( Lisanti et al . , 1994 ; Li et al . , 1996 ; Tiruppathi et al . , 1997 ) and gp60 ( Tiruppathi et al . , 1997 ) , and thereby signal vesicle formation and trafficking . Thus , the gp60 – caveolin - 1 complex could function in much the same manner as G - protein – coupled receptors that in - teract with G a i and Src . In summary , we have shown that G i is required for sig - naling of vesicle formation in endothelial cells after gp60 activation . Overexpression of wt - caveolin - 1 and expres - sion of dn - Src prevented gp60 - induced formation of vesi - cles . In each case , the role of G i was important since cave - olin - 1 – overexpressing cells sequestered G a i , whereas dn - Src expression interfered with the binding of G a i to ca - veolin - 1 . These results indicate an important role of gp60 - induced activation of the G i - coupled Src kinase pathway in signaling the formation of endocytic vesicles and their di - rected migration to the basolateral surface of the vascular endothelial barrier .
