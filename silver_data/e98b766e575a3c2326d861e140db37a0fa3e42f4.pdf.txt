In vertebrates , alternative splicing gives rise to two CDC42 proteins : the ubiquitously expressed isoform ( CDC42u ) and the brain isoform ( CDC42b ) , whose specific roles are not fully elucidated . The two isoforms only differ in their carboxy - terminal sequence , which includes the CAAX motif essential for CDC42 interaction with membrane . Here we show that these divergent sequences do not directly affect the range of CDC42’s potential binding partners , but indirectly influence CDC42 - driven signaling by controlling the specific subcellular localization of the two isoforms . In astrocytes and neural precursors , which naturally express both variants , CDC42u is mainly cytosolic and associates with the leading - edge plasma membrane of migrating cells where it recruits the Par6 - PKC z complex to fulfill its polarity function . In contrast , CDC42b mainly localizes to intracellular membrane compartments , where it interacts with N - WASP . CDC42b does not participate in cell polarization but embodies the major isoform regulating endocytosis . Both CDC42 isoforms act in concert by contributing their specific functions to promote chemotaxis of neural precursors , demonstrating that the expression pattern of the two isoforms is decisive for the tissue - specific behavior of cells . 3 Introduction CDC42 is a small G protein of the Rho family ( Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2002 ) ( Etienne - Manneville , 2004 ) . Like most Rho GTPases , it switches between a GDP - bound inactive status and a GTP - bound form that can activate a large panel of effector proteins . Through these effectors RhoGTPases participate in numerous signaling cascades regulating a wide range of cellular responses . CDC42 interactions with its regulators and effectors generally occur on the cytosolic sides of cellular membranes whose planar geometry is thought to facilitate molecular interactions . Specific GEFs and GAPs regulate GTP - GDP cycling of CDC42 ( Hodge and Ridley , 2016 ) . The membrane localization of CDC42 , like of other RhoGTPases , relies on the post - translational prenylation of the cysteine included in the carboxy - terminal CAAX box . This modification promotes the protein anchorage in the lipid bilayer . GDIs can interact with the lipid anchors of Rho GTPases to sequester them in the cytosol and thereby inhibit their functions ( Hodge and Ridley , 2016 ; Johnson et al . , 2009 ; Nomanbhoy et al . , 1999 ) . The Rho GTPase CDC42 is more particularly known for its fundamental role in the control of polarity during cell asymmetric division , cell differentiation and cell migration in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals ( Etienne - Manneville , 2004 ) . CDC42 – mediated signaling controls cytoskeleton rearrangement , which affects various actin and / or microtubule - dependent cellular processes and plays a key role in clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytosis , in exocytosis and , in vesicle transport ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ; Chen et al . , 2005 ; Erickson and Cerione , 2001 ; Harris and Tepass , 2010 ; Mayor et al . , 2014 ; Ridley , 2006 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ; Wu et al . , 2000 ) . Functional dysregulation of CDC42 has been implicated in the pathology of several disease states and developmental disorders , including cancer ( Aspenstrom , 2018 ; Martinelli et al . , 2018 ) . Studies using constitutively active or dominant - negative CDC42 mutants showed that CDC42 acts an oncoprotein which promotes cellular transformation and metastasis in the context of loss of polarity ( Fidyk et al . , 2006 ; Haga and Ridley , 2016 ; Johnson et al . , 2010 ; Reymond et al . , 2012 ) . On the contrary , gene knockout studies suggested that CDC42 might also function as a tumor suppressor , because targeted knockout of the CDC42 gene in hepatocytes or blood stem / progenitor cells resulted in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma or myeloproliferative disease in mice ( van Hengel et al . , 2008 ) . This ambiguity makes understanding the role of CDC42 driven polarization in the context of cancer biology challenging . 4 Previous CDC42 studies have been mostly focused on the ubiquitous CDC42 isoform ( CDC42u ) . However , the human CDC42 gene located on chromosome 1 gives rise to three transcripts via alternative splicing , which translate into two distinct CDC42 isoforms . CDC42u , initially described as placental CDC42 , does not include the exon 6 but an alternative exon 7 and is ubiquitously expressed ( Marks and Kwiatkowski , 1996 ) . In contrast , the so - called brain isoform ( CDC42b ) , is generated by translation of the exons 1 - 6 and was initially detected in brain tissue . The expression of the ubiquitous isoform CDC42u in neuronal precursors and non - neuronal cells switches to a stable co - expression of the CDC42b and CDC42u isoforms at the single - neuron level . During neurogenesis , CDC42u specifically drives the formation of neuroprogenitor cells , whereas CDC42b is essential for promoting the transition of neuroprogenitor cells to neurons . However , the molecular mechanisms responsible for the specific functions of these two isoforms and their role in non - neuronal cells remain unknown . In fact , both isoforms were found to be expressed in a range of commonly used laboratory cell lines , including HEK and MDCKII cells ( Wirth et al . , 2013 ) . This splice variant may thus also be expressed in non - brain tissue cells underlining the need to clarify the functional differences between the two CDC42 variants in non - cell specific functions . By inactivating specifically each of the two CDC42 variants in brain cells such as astrocytes and neural precursor cells ( NPC ) , we unravel the specific localization and functions of the two isoforms during persistent directed migration . Results Cell polarization relies on ubiquitous CDC42 To determine whether CDC42 isoforms had different functions , we used primary astrocytes , glial cells in which we determined the expression levels of CDC42 isoforms . Primary rat astrocytes were transfected with siRNAs designed to selectively knockdown brain ( si - b1 , si - b2 ) or ubiquitous ( si - u1 , si - u2 ) CDC42 or with a siRNA targeting a common sequence ( si - both ) to simultaneously inhibit both isoforms . We developed a CDC42b specific antibody to assess the specific expression of this isoform ( Fig . S1A , S1B ) . Unfortunately , we could not obtain an antibody specific for CDC42u . Thus , we used qPCR to quantify CDC42u and total CDC42 mRNA level . Knockdown of each isoform revealed that roughly 15 - 20 % of total CDC42 mRNA in astrocytes encodes the brain isoform ( Fig . S1C , S1D ) ( Yap et al . , 2016 ) . 5 We then chose to determine the contribution of each CDC42 isoform in cell directed migration , a more complex and integrated cell function . Control and CDC42 knockdown cells were submitted to a scratch - induced migration assay , a well - characterized model system in which we have previously demonstrated that CDC42 is activated by an integrin - mediated signaling and involved in microtubule - dependent front - rear cell polarization , Golgi and centrosome reorientation , and directed membrane recycling ( Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2001 ; Osmani et al . , 2006 ) . Knockdown of both CDC42 isoforms did not influence the migration velocity , but led to a strong decrease in directionality ( 83 % to about 55 % ) and persistence ( 85 % to about 60 % ) of migration ( Fig . 1A - 1C ) . The specific depletion of CDC42u led to similar results with a significant decrease in the directionality and persistence of migration , whereas CDC42b - depleted cells migrated similarly as control astrocytes ( Fig . 1A - 1C ) . Associated with the alteration of directional persistence , the number of filopodia , classic actin - driven function of CDC42 at the cell leading edge was strongly inhibited by the simultaneous depletion of both isoforms . A similar result was observed upon specific depletion of CDC42u . In contrast , CDC42b depletion alone had no impact on filopodia formation , suggesting a more predominant role of CDC42u in this phenomenon ( Fig . S1E ) . To assess the mechanisms involved in the control of directed migration , we looked at Golgi reorientation in cells at the wound edge . Following wounding of the astrocyte monolayer , the Golgi apparatus together with the centrosome localizes in front of the nucleus in the direction of migration in a CDC42 - dependent manner ( Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2001 ) . Here , microtubule polarized rearrangement and Golgi reorientation were dramatically impaired by the depletion of both CDC42 isoforms as expected , and were similarly affected by the specific depletion of the CDC42u ( Fig . 1D , E ) . In contrast , CDC42b knockdown had no detectable effect ( Fig . 1D , E ) . The Par6 / PKCζ polarity complex is a key mediator of CDC42 function in astrocyte polarization ( Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2001 ; Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2003a ; Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2003b ; Etienne - Manneville et al . , 2005 ) . Depletion of CDC42u alone or of both CDC42 variants , but not of CDC42b alone , prevented the recruitment of the aPKC protein family member PKCζ to the cell leading edge ( Fig . 1F , G ) , confirming that CDC42u , but not CDC42b , is required for the activation of the polarity pathway in astrocytes . To determine whether the lack of function of CDC42b was due to its relatively low level of expression , siRNA - resistant CDC42u ( u RES ) or CDC42b ( b RES ) were expressed . u RES , but not b RES rescued Golgi reorientation in CDC42 - depleted astrocytes ( si - both ) ( Fig . 1H ) . Together , these 6 observations point to the ubiquitous CDC42u isoform as the main regulator of cell polarity and directed migration in astrocytes . Brain and ubiquitous isoforms show similar binding partners We then investigated the molecular differences that could explain the functional specificity of the two CDC42 isoforms . The alternative splicing of the carboxy - terminal ( C - ter ) exons causes a major difference in the last 10 amino acids of CDC42 isoforms ( Fig . 2A ) . Since the C - ter domain of Rac was shown to participate in its interaction with some of its effectors ( Abdrabou and Wang , 2018 ; Knaus et al . , 1998 ) , we examined whether both CDC42 variants could interact with the same effectors . We first tested their interaction with Par6 and PKCζ by performing immunoprecipitation of constitutively active ( CA ) V12 - , GFP - tagged CDC42b and CDC42u in HEK cells ( Fig . 2B ) . In these conditions , both isoforms appear to interact similarly with the Par6 - aPKCζ polarity complex ( Fig . 2C ) . Thus , we next performed GFP - trap pull - down assays using HEK cells overexpressing GFP tagged CDC42 isoforms ( Fig . 2D ) . The GFP - tagged WT - or CA - Cdc42 resins along with co - immunoprecipitated interactors were sent for a mass spectrometric proteomic screen . Quantitative analysis was performed to assess the fold change of peptides bound to one isoform of CDC42 in comparison to GFP control . Analysis of best binding partners was performed with the CA mutant of each isoform to capture a maximum of effector proteins ( see methods for access to PRIDE repository containing raw data and screen analysis ) . We then performed loose filtering parameters to segregate the interactors of the screen into effectors and also GEFs , GAPs . We identified 29 effectors out of 40 known epithelial effector proteins of CDC42 ( Fig 2D , S2A ) ( Pichaud et al . , 2019 ) . We could also detect 7 known GEFs ( Fig 2E , S2B ) and 5 known GAPs ( Fig 2F , S2C ) . We could not identify any statistically significant difference in the list of effectors or in the fold change of effectors between both isoforms ( Fig . S2 and PRIDE repository ) . These results show that despite their divergent carboxy - terminal sequences , both CDC42 isoforms can biochemically interact with the same binding partners . From the correlation plots of the corresponding fold change for each isoform we analyzed the linear regression for all three plots . The R 2 = 0 . 893 for GEFs , 0 , 900 for GAPs and 0 . 978 for effectors therefore indicated a good linear fit correlation ( Fig 2D - F ) , which may suggest that the alternative splicing does not strongly modify the binding affinity of the CDC42 with its main partners . Brain and ubiquitous CDC42 display different intracellular localization 7 Seeking an alternative explanation to the functional specificity of the two isoforms , we asked whether the carboxy - terminal sequence which includes the CAAX box required for membrane recruitment of the CDC42 proteins may influence the protein subcellular localization and ability to encounter its interactors . Immunoprecipitation experiments are typically performed using cells which strongly overexpress the tagged CDC42 ( Fig . 2G ) , leaving the possibility that a specific subcellular localization of endogenous protein isoforms may be a critical factor in the control of CDC42 interactions with its effectors . Since we could not find nor produce any antibody that specifically recognize CDC42 isoforms in immunoprecipitation or in immunofluorescence , we microinjected constructs encoding fluorescently - tagged CDC42 isoforms into astrocyte nuclei . Cells were imaged after a short time of expression ( 4h ) to obtain low levels of expression . In contrast to cell transfection , short - term expression after microinjection revealed a different localization of the two CDC42 isoforms in astrocytes ( Fig . 3A and Movie 1 - 3 ) . Movie 1 shows non - migrating astrocytes expressing GFP - CDC42b together with mCherry - CDC42u . CDC42u is mainly cytosolic , whereas CDC42b appears to be largely associated with intracellular compartments . Movies 2 and 3 show the localization of CDC42 isoforms in cells actively migrating in a scratch - induced migration assay , previously shown to activate CDC42 through the integrin - mediated recruitment of the GEF β PIX ( Osmani et al . , 2010 ) . . CDC42u accumulated at the leading edge plasma membrane , including in filopodia . CDC42b was recruited to the cell front , generally slightly behind the leading edge ( Fig . 3A ) . CDC42b was most strikingly found on intracellular membranes including cytoplasmic vesicles where it colocalized with the early endosome marker EEA1 and Golgi apparatus where it colocalized with the cis - marker GM130 ( Fig . 3A - C ) . In contrast , CDC42u was rarely detectable at these sites ( Movie 3 , Fig . 3A - C ) . This differential subcellular localization of the isoforms was confirmed using a different , smaller ALFA tag ( Fig . S1F ) . We asked whether specific subcellular localization was due to the divergent C - ter domain of CDC42 . The C - ter CAAX box of both isoforms is geranyl - geranylated but CDC42b can bear an additional palmitoyl group attached to the last cysteine residue in a reversible manner ( Kang et al . , 2008 ; Nishimura and Linder , 2013 , Nishimura , 2019 # 19536 ) . Suppression of the geranyl - geranylation by a CVLL to SVLL mutation in CDC42u ( u ( SVLL ) ) ( Nishimura and Linder , 2013 ) led to its accumulation in the nucleus ( Fig . 3D ) . A similar CCIF to SCIF mutation in CDC42b ( b ( SCIF ) ) to prevent all lipid modification of CDC42b resulted in complete loss of endomembrane - binding and cytosolic distribution of the protein . In contrast , the CCIF to CSIF mutation , which specifically prevents 8 palmitoylation but not geranyl - geranylation , inhibited recruitment of CDC42b to the plasma membrane and on endocytic vesicles , but did not prevent its association with the Golgi apparatus ( Fig . 3D ) , suggesting that palmitoylation controls the recruitment of CDC42b to the cytoplasmic vesicles from the Golgi apparatus . We confirmed the role of lipid anchors in the membrane association of CDC42 isoforms by treating cells with GGTI298 , which prevents both geranyl - geranylation and palmitoylation , or with 2 - bromopalmitate ( 2BP ) , a specific inhibitor of palmitoylation ( Fig . S3A ) . These results show that the lipid modifications of the carboxy - terminal domain of CDC42 isoforms are crucial for the specific membrane association of the two proteins . They further suggest that the divergent C - ter domains may contribute to the functional specificities of CDC42 isoforms by controlling their subcellular localization , indirectly affecting their abitlity to interact with their effectors . Brain CDC42 is the major CDC42 isoform involved in N - WASP dependent endocytosis Following this line of reasoning , we sought for CDC42b specific functions on intracellular membrane compartments . In migrating astrocytes , CDC42 not only controls Par6 - dependent cell polarity , it is also involved together with Arf6 in vesicular recycling from the plasma membrane ( Osmani et al . , 2010 ) . Because CDC42b showed a strong enrichment on EEA1 - positive organelles compared to CDC42u ( Fig . 3A - C ) , we performed dextran uptake experiments to examine the role of CDC42 isoforms in the formation of the EEA1 - positive pinosomes which are frequently observed at the leading edge of migrating astrocytes . Knockdown of both isoforms of CDC42 strongly reduced ( - 47 % ) dextran uptake ( Fig . 4A ) . Strikingly , CDC42u depletion caused a minor reduction of dextran internalization , whereas CDC42b knockdown significantly decreased the uptake rates ( by approximately 40 % ; Fig . 4A ) . The predominant role of CDC42b in pinocytosis was confirmed by rescue experiments in astrocytes depleted for both isoforms . GFP - CDC42b RES led to a stronger rescue than GFP - CDC42u RES ( Fig . 4B ) . The non - lipid - modified mutants of either isoform ( b RES ( SCIF ) , u RES ( SVLL ) ) did not rescue dextran uptake ( Fig . 4B ) . Furthermore , overexpression of the non - palmitoylable CDC42b mutant ( b RES ( CSIF ) ) did not restore the dextran uptake ( Fig . 4B ) indicating that palmitoylation , which promotes CDC42b association with intracellular vesicles specifically ( Fig . 3D ) is crucial for its function in pinocytosis . Dextran uptake experiments using specific inhibitors of lipid modification ( GGTI298 or 2BP ) confirmed these findings ( Fig . S3B ) . These results 9 show that palmitoylated CDC42b is the major CDC42 isoform involved in pinocytosis in migrating astrocytes . SiRNA - mediated depletion of N - WASP ( Fig . 4C ) inhibited dextran uptake in migrating astrocytes to a similar level as CDC42b knock - down ( Fig . 4A and 4B ) , as previously reported ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2002 ; Legg et al . , 2007 ) . A double knockdown of CDC42b and N - WASP did not further increase the reduction in dextran uptake ( ~ 40 % ) ( Fig . 4D ) . Finally , expression of an activated form of N - WASP ( GFP - NWCA ) in CDC42b depleted cells rescued macropinocytosis confirming that N - WASP is the major effector of CDC42b controlling macropinocytosis in astrocytes ( Fig . 4E ) . We looked at the localization CDC42b colocalized with N - WASP on macropinosomes in migrating astrocytes , whereas CDC42u was rarely observed on any intracellular vesicles including macropinosomes ( Fig . 3A , 3C and 4F , movie 4 ) . These data indicate that the C - ter domain of CDC42b controls its association with intracellular vesicles , its interaction with N - WASP and CDC42 / N - WASP - mediated pinocytosis . However , when N - WASP association with CDC42 isoforms was assessed in overexpressing HEK cells ( Fig . 4G ) , there was no significant difference in the ability of N - WASP to bind each isoform ( Fig . 4G , 4H ) as observed in proteomic analysis of CDC42 interactome ( Fig . 2E ) . We conclude that even if both isoforms can interact with N - WASP in vitro , CDC42b is main regulator of N - WASP - dependent micropinocytosis in cells because of its specific localization on endocytic vesicles . Both CDC42 isoforms contribute their specific functions during chemotaxis of neural precursor cells Since CDC42 isoforms show functional differences , we asked whether they may cooperate in more complex migratory situations where both front - rear polarization and endocytosis are required . Neural precursor cells ( NPCs ) migrate long distances from their zones of origin to their final destination where they differentiate , following gradients of chemoattractants ( Leong et al . , 2011 ) . In NPCs , both isoforms are expressed at approximately identical levels ( Fig . 5A ) ( Yap et al . , 2016 ) . Like in astrocytes , short - term expression of microinjected CDC42 constructs in NPCs illustrated the distinct subcellular localization of CDC42u and CDC42b . CDC42u was mainly visible in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane and the CDC42b accumulated on intracellular EEA1 - positive vesicles and on the Golgi apparatus ( Fig . 5B , 5C ) . 10 NPCs grow in a primary 3D tissue culture system ( neurospheres ) and their migration can be observed when neurospheres are placed on an adhesive substrate ( Durbec et al . , 2008 ) ( Fig . 5D ) . Using video microscopy , we first analyzed NPC migration out from neurospheres . The directional persistence was strongly reduced in CDC42u - depleted cells ( from 76 % to 58 - 60 % ) and in cells lacking both isoforms ( to 50 % ) , but was not significantly altered by CDC42b or N - WASP depletion ( Fig 5D , 5E , and S3C ) . We next performed dextran uptake assays in siRNA treated NPCs . CDC42b specific depletion , like N - WASP depletion , significantly decreased dextran uptake into NPCs , whereas knockdown of CDC42u had no significant effect ( Fig . 5F and S3D ) . These results in NPCs confirmed the predominant role of CDC42u in cell polarization and of CDC42b in macropinocytosis . We then tested the contribution of the two isoforms during NPC chemotactic migration , during which endocytosis is involved in the processing of chemotactic signals ( Zhou et al . , 2007 ) . We used a Boyden chamber - based xCelligence - assay to analyze the chemotactic migration of astrocytes and NPCs . In the absence of a gradient , astrocytes and NPCs barely migrated through the filter ( Fig . S3E , S3F ) . Addition of FBS in the lower compartment induced the chemotactic migration of both astrocytes and NPCs ( Fig . 5G , 5H ) . The knockdown of N - WASP decreased chemotaxis efficiency in NPCs but did not affect astrocyte chemotaxis ( Fig . 5G , 5H ) . When astrocytes or NPCs were transfected with siRNAs targeting both CDC42 isoforms , chemotaxis was strongly reduced in both cell types ( Fig . 5I , 5J ) . For both cell types , CDC42u specific depletion also strongly reduced chemotactic migration . In contrast , CDC42b depletion led to a significant decrease in N - WASP - dependent NPC chemotaxis without altering N - WASP - independent astrocyte migration ( Fig . 5I , 5J ) . We conclude that CDC42b is the major isoform involved in N - WASP dependent function in NPC chemotaxis and that both isoforms of CDC42 contribute their specific functions to participate to complex migratory processes such as NPC chemotaxis . Discussion In conclusion , we show that , while both CDC42 isoform can in principle interact with the same effectors in vitro , they do have non - redundant functions in cells . These findings illustrate the impact of subcellular localization on specific protein molecular interactions and cellular functions . More specifically , efficient cell polarization and directed persistent migration solely require the CDC42u isoform both in astrocytes and in NPCs . Although both CDC42u and CDC42b can biochemically interact with Par6 - aPKC , only 11 CDC42u can recruit Par6 and aPKC at the leading edge plasma membrane . Conversaly , although both CDC42u and CDC42b can biochemically interact with N - WASP , CDC42b which preferentially localizes on intracellular compartments , is the predominant splice variant involved in the regulation of N - WASP - dependent endocytosis . Altogether , these observations the importance of subcellular compartmentalization in CDC42 and more generally Rho GTPases’ functions . The recruitment of CDC42 as well as other RhoGTPases is dictated by their carboxy - terminal sequence and at least in part by lipid modifications ( Farhan and Hsu 2016 ; Ravichandran , Goud , and Manneville 2020 ) . Related to this finding , mutations that touch on this carboxy - terminal variable sequence of CDC42 and can affect either one or both CDC42 , are associated with distinct dramatic disorders ( Bekhouche et al . , 2020 ; Martinelli et al . , 2018 ) . The fact that palmitoylation as well as scratch - induced signaling influence Cdc42b recruitment to trafficking vesicles from the Golgi apparatus suggests that each isoform may be regulated by distinct pathways . The fact that GDI3 , a GDI expressed in the brain and pancreas , localizes at the Golgi apparatus via a N - terminal hydrophobic anchor ( Brunet et al . , 2002 ) , suggests yet another potential regulatory mechanism . Future work will focus on deciphering how the amino acid sequence and / or the lipid modifications lead to such radical differences in CDC42 localization to better understand how alterations of the carboxy - terminal sequence can induce specific diseases ( Bekhouche et al . , 2020 ) . The two CDC42 isoforms have been reported to be functionally specialized during neurogenesis . CDC42u stimulates mTORC1 activity to promote neuroprogenitor formation , whereas CDC42b works synergistically with activated CDC42 - associated kinase ( ACK ) in down - regulating mTOR expression and promoting neuronal differentiation . It is remarkable that the two highly - similar CDC42 splice variants regulate distinct stages of neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation ( Endo et al . , 2020 ) . Moreover the conditional inactivation of the CDC42 gene in cortical neurons reduces the efficiency of axon formation ( Garvalov et al . , 2007 ) . In this context , CDC42u whose mRNA preferentially localizes into axons plays a role in axonogenesis ( Lee et al . , 2021 ) whereas the palmitoylation of CDC42b accounts for its preferential localization to dendritic spines and its role in dendrite maturation . These findings have advanced the understanding of mechanisms underlying axo - dendritic polarity in developing neurons and argue that co - expression of the non - redundant CDC42 isoforms in the same cell is important during neuronal development ( Yap et al . , 12 2016 ) . . With the identification of the role of CDC42b in the formation of dendritic spines during neuronal differentiation ( Kang et al . , 2008 ; Wirth et al . , 2013 ) , our identification of its role in endocytosis and NPC chemotaxis is increasing evidence that the brain variant controls specific neural functions . NPC migration is a crucial step in brain development and conditional deletion of both CDC42 isoforms in mouse NPCs has been shown to cause malformations in the brain ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) . Nevertheless both CDC42 isoforms contribute , albeit differently , to the behavior of NPCs , underlining that the co - expression of these non - redundant isoforms is essential during neuronal development . Materials and Methods Antibodies and inhibitors The following primary antibodies were used in this study : rat monoclonal anti - α - tubulin ( AbDSerotec MCA77G ) , mouse monoclonal anti - GM130 ( BD Transduction 610823 ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - pericentrin ( Covance PRB 432 - C ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - N - WASP ( Abcam AB23394 ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - PKCζ C - 20 ( Santa Cruz Biotech SC - 216 ) , mouse anti - EEA1 ( BD biosciences 610457 ) and HRP coupled anti - GFP ( Abcam ab6663 ) . As secondary antibodies we used standard antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch : Cy5 conjugated donkey anti - mouse , Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated donkey anti - rat , TRITC conjugated donkey anti - rabbit , as well as HRP coupled donkey anti - mouse , anti - rabbit and anti - goat . For Western Blot detection of CDC42b a custom - made isoform specific rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated by Covalab using 2 peptides for 2 immunization steps . Peptide 1 for first immunization step : C - AALEPPETQPKRK - coNH2 ( CDC42b amino acids 175 - 187 ) ; peptide 2 for second immunization step : C - ETQPKRK - coNH2 ( CDC42b amino acids 181 - 187 ) . The antibody was subsequently purified from the anti - serum via immobilized peptide 2 . DAPI in ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent ( Life Tech ) was used to visualize nuclei . To suppress lipid modification of CDC42 isoforms , cells were treated overnight in 120 µM 2BP ( to suppress palmitoylation ; Sigma ) or 20 µM GGTI298 ( to suppress geranyl - geranylation and palmitoylation ; Tocris ) Cell Culture All procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines approved by the French Ministry of Agriculture , following European standards . Preparation of neurosphere cultures was performed as described ( Calaora et al . , 2001 ) . Briefly , the striata of E14 OFA rats 13 were removed from the embryos and mechanically dissociated before cells were seeded at 1 . 2 × 10 5 cells / ml in uncoated 260 ml culture flasks ( Fisher Bioblock Sc . ) . Culture medium consisted of DMEM / F - 12 ( Gibco ) supplemented with 2 % B27 ( Gibco ) and 50µg / ml gentamicin ( Sigma ) in the presence of 20 ng / ml EGF ( R & D Systems Europe ) . Media were supplemented with 20 ng / ml EGF every 48h , and spheres passaged using 0 . 025 % trypsin - EDTA ( Gibco ) on the fourth and sixth day in culture . Human FGF - b ( RayBiotech ) was also added to the medium at 10 ng / ml for the first four days of culture . For preparation of primary astrocyte cultures , the telencephala of E18 OFA rats were removed from the embryos and mechanically dissociated . Cells were plated and maintained as previously described ( Etienne - Manneville , 2006 ) using 1g / l glucose DMEM ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Eurobio ) and penicillin / streptomycin ( 10 , 000 U ml −1 and 10 , 000 μg ml −1 ; Gibco ) as culture medium . HEK and HeLa cells were cultured in 4 . 5g / l glucose DMEM ( Gibco ) supplemented with FBS and antibiotics as added for astrocytes . All cells were kept in a 37°C incubator at 5 % CO2 . Immunoprecipitation assay and mass spectrometric proteomic screen GFP Immunoprecipitation assay was carried out , where HEK cells transfected with GFP tagged constructs of CDC42 were lysed using 50mM TRIS base , Triton 2 % , 200mM NaCl as well as 1 tablet / 10 ml protease inhibitor Mini - complete , EDTA - free ( Roche ) . After removal of insoluble fragments via centrifugation at 12 , 000 g for 25 min , lysates were incubated with 15 µl of GFP - Trap Agarose beads from Chromotek for 1h at 4 °C on a rotary wheel . The beads were washed using a wash buffer comprising of 50mM TRIS base , 150mM NaCl , 1mM EDTA and 2 . 5 mM MgCl2 and pH adjusted to 7 . 5 . Following the final wash beads were stored with wash buffer in 4°C prior to depositing at the Institut Curie Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics facility ( LSMP ) . Where proteins on beads were washed twice with 100μL of 25mM NH 4 HCO 3 and we performed on - beads digestion with 0 . 2μg of trypsin / LysC ( Promega ) for 1 hour in 100µL of 25mM NH 4 HCO 3 . Sample was then loaded onto a homemade C18 StageTips for desalting . Peptides were eluted using 40 / 60 MeCN / H2O + 0 . 1 % formic acid and vacuum concentrated to dryness . Online chromatography was performed with an RSLCnano system ( Ultimate 3000 , Thermo Scientific ) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer ( Thermo Scientific ) . Peptides were trapped on a C18 column ( 75μm inner diameter × 2cm ; 14 nanoViper Acclaim PepMapTM 100 , Thermo Scientific ) with buffer A ( 2 / 98 MeCN / H 2 O in 0 . 1 % formic acid ) at a flow rate of 4 . 0µL / min over 4 min . Separation was performed on a 50cm x 75μm C18 column ( nanoViper Acclaim PepMapTM RSLC , 2μm , 100Å , Thermo Scientific ) regulated to a temperature of 55°C with a linear gradient of 5 % to 25 % buffer B ( 100 % MeCN in 0 . 1 % formic acid ) at a flow rate of 300nL / min over 100 min . Full - scan MS was acquired in the Orbitrap analyzer with a resolution set to 120 , 000 and ions from each full scan were HCD fragmented and analyzed in the linear ion trap . For identification the data were searched against the Homo sapiens ( UP000005640 ) SwissProt database using Sequest HF through proteome discoverer ( version 2 . 2 ) . Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin and a maximum of two missed cleavage site were allowed . Oxidized methionine , N - terminal acetylation , and carbamidomethyl cysteine were set as variable modifications . Maximum allowed mass deviation was set to 10 ppm for monoisotopic precursor ions and 0 . 6 Da for MS / MS peaks . The resulting files were further processed using myProMS ( Poullet et al . , 2007 ) v3 . 6 ( work in progress ) . FDR calculation used Percolator and was set to 1 % at the peptide level for the whole study . The label free quantification was performed by peptide Extracted Ion Chromatograms ( XICs ) computed with MassChroQ version 2 . 2 ( Valot et al . , 2011 ) . For protein quantification , XICs from proteotypic peptides shared between compared conditions ( TopN matching ) with no missed cleavages were used . Median and scale normalization was applied on the total signal to correct the XICs for each biological replicate . To estimate the significance of the change in protein abundance , a linear model ( adjusted on peptides and biological replicates ) was performed and p - values were adjusted with a Benjamini – Hochberg FDR procedure with a control threshold set to 0 . 05 . The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE ( Vizcaino et al . , 2016 ) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD017477 ( username : reviewer51683 @ ebi . ac . uk , Password : 4fNr03LX ) Cell transfection and RNAi siRNA constructs were introduced into rat astrocytes or NPCs by Nucleofection technology ( Amaxa Biosystems ) using Lonza protocols . Plasmids encoding fluorescently tagged constructs were microinjected . All siRNAs were obtained from Eurofins except for a non - targeting control , which was obtained from Dharmacon . To quantify knockdowns , protein samples were analyzed using ECL immunoblotting and ImageJ . Alternatively , mRNA levels were measured using qPCR ( see below ) . In each case , cells were analyzed 15 4 days after transfection with siRNAs . Transfection of HEK293 and HeLa cells with plasmids was performed with the calcium phosphate method . si - N - WASP : 5’ - CUUGUCAAGUAGCUCUUAA ( dTdT ) - 3’ si - both : 5’ - UGAUGGUGCUGUUGGUAAA ( dTdT ) - 3’ si - u1 : 5’ - CAAUAAUGACAGACGACCU ( dTdT ) - 3’ si - u2 : 5’ - GCAAUAUUGGCUGCCUUGGUU ( dTdT ) - 3’ si - b1 : 5’ - CCAUUUAACAAUCGACUUA ( dTdT ) - 3’ si - b2 : 5’ - ACUCAACCCAAAAGGAAGUUU ( dTdT ) - 3’ Real time qPCR For isolation of total RNA striatal neurospheres or cultured astrocytes were prepared from E14 or E18 rat embryos respectively . RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy Mini Kit ( QIAGEN ) followed by the digestion of contaminating genomic DNA ( Turbo DNA Free ) . RNA concentration and purity were determined by spectrophotometry . cDNA synthesis was performed according to kit instructions ( VILO cDNA synthesis ; Invitrogen ) . Quantitative real - time PCR was performed using Applied Biosystems custom TaqMan Gene Expression Assays designed using the Taqman Assay Search Tool ( Life Technologies ) for the ubiquitous CDC42 isoform . Assay Rn00821429 _ g1 was used to quantify panCDC42 mRNA levels ( both isoforms ) . As endogenous control we used PGK1 ( assay Rn00821429 _ g1 ) and Ppia ( assay Rn00690933 _ m1 ) ( all from Life Technologies ) for astrocytes and Casc3 ( Rn00595941 _ m1 ) and Eif2b1 ( Rn00596951 _ m1 ) for neural precursor cells . Real - time PCR amplification was performed on a Sequence Detection System ( 7500 ; Applied Biosystems ) using TaqMan Universal MMix II ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Thermal cycling conditions were as follows : 50°C for 2 min , 95°C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s , and 60°C for 1 min . Data were collected and analyzed with the SDS software v2 . 0 . 6 ( Applied Biosystems ) . The comparative CT Method ( ΔΔC T ) was used as described in the AB7500 SDS guidelines . Live spinning disk confocal microscopy To study protein localization in live cells , plasmids encoding the GFP - or mCherry tagged protein were microinjected into wound border astrocytes plated on glass bottom dishes ( MatTek ) and scratched 1h before microinjection . Live imaging was done 4 - 8h later using 16 a spinning disk confocal microscope ( Perkin Elmer Ultra View ERS ) equipped with a heating chamber ( 37°C ) and CO2 supply ( 5 % ) . Centrosome / Golgi reorientation and PKCζ localization assays Scratch - induced cell polarization of astrocytes was studied as detailed previously ( Etienne - Manneville , 2006 ) . Briefly , a monolayer of astrocytes plated on poly - L - ornithine ( Sigma ) coated coverslips was scratched and fixed 8h later followed by immunostaining of centrosome , Golgi and microtubules . Wound border cells were counted as polarized when the centrosome and Golgi were situated within the 90° or 120°C section of a virtual circle drawn around the nucleus that faces the wound ( see Fig . 4B ) . Images were acquired on a Leica DM6000 epifluorescence microscope equipped with 40× , NA 1 . 25 and a 63× , NA 1 . 4 objective lenses and were recorded with a CCD camera ( CoolSNAP HQ , Roper Scientific ) using Leica LAS AF software . PKCζ accumulation at the cell front was studied in knockdown cells situated on poly - L - ornithine coated cover slips and fixed 4h after wounding . Cell Spreading Assays Sixteen - well E - plates ( Ozyme ) were pre - coated with 25µg / ml Fibronectin ( Sigma ) for NPCs or used uncoated for astrocytes . Single cell suspensions of 1x10 5 NPC or 5x10 4 astrocytes in 100µl of normal culture medium were added per well . Each condition ( control or siRNA Transfected ) was run in triplicate wells . Cell adhesion and spreading was measured as changes in impedance measured on the xCelligence RTCA DP Analyzer ( ACEA Biosciences ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Cell Migration Assays Astrocyte wound healing and neurosphere migration assays : For live imaging of astrocyte wound healing experiments , Transfected astrocytes were seeded into poly - L - ornithin ( Sigma ) coated 12 - well standard plastic dishes using normal cell culture medium . Cell monolayers were scratched immediately before image acquisition followed by addition of 20mM Hepes ( Sigma ) as well as antioxidant ( Sigma ) to the medium and addition of liquid paraffin on top of the medium . Video time - lapse data were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a 37°C humidified heating chamber as well as CO2 supply ( 5 % ) by taking pictures every 15min over 16h and analyzed by manual tracking of cells using ImageJ , as described previously ( Camand et al . , 2012 ) . For tracking of NPCs , 17 neurospheres obtained from suspension cultures of transfected cells were plated into fibronectin coated 12 - well plastic dishes immediately before life imaging followed by addition of HEPES , antioxidant and paraffin as for astrocytes . Images were taken every 5 min for NPCs . Chemotaxis assays : The bottom wells of sixteen - well C . I . M plates ( Ozyme ) were filled with 160µl of normal culture medium for astrocytes or NPCs containing 10 % FBS in both cases . The upper wells were filled with 50µl of normal culture medium without FBS ( but containing B27 in case of NPCs ) . After 1h of equilibration in the incubator , single cell suspensions of 1x10 5 NPC or 5x10 4 astrocytes in 100µl medium ( without FBS ) were added to the upper wells plated in the upper wells . Each condition ( control or siRNA Transfected ) was run in triplicate wells on the xCelligence RTCA DP Analyzer according to user guidelines . Cell migration was measured as changes in impedance with the slopes of cell migration being compared over 10h . Endocytosis assays Neurospheres were incubated for 1 . 5h at 37°C in 1mg / ml Texas Red labeled dextran ( 10 kDa Invitrogen ) , extensively washed and plated on poly - L - ornithine and fibronectin coated glass coverslips for 4h , before being fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde . Transfected astrocytes were plated on poly - L - ornithine coated coverslips and scratched 4d later followed by addition of 1mg / ml fluorescent dextran . Cells were fixed in PFA after 1 . 5 h and analyzed on the Leica DM6000 epifluorescence microscope described above . The relative amount of dextran uptake was determined using ImageJ to quantify the number of fluorescence maxima per cell after background subtraction . Pull down assays HEK cells were used non - transfected to test interactions with an endogenous protein . Cells were lysed using pull down buffer containing 500mM NaCl , 15mM KCl , 8mM TRIS base , 12mM HEPES free base , 3mM MgCl2 , 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 as well as 1 tablet / 10ml protease inhibitor Mini - complete , EDTA - free ( Roche ) . After removal of insoluble compounds via centrifugation , lysates were incubated with glutathione Sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare ) coated with the other interaction partner for 30min at 4°C on a rotary wheel . Subsequently , beads were washed three times for 10min with the same buffer containing however doubled amounts of NaCl on the rotary wheel , followed by detection of associated proteins using Western Blotting . 18 Acknowledgements This work was supported by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and the Institut Pasteur .
