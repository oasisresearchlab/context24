A behavioral study was performed in an attempt to understand the neurological mechanism involved in yawning in rats . Intraperitoneal injections of low doses ( 0 . 25 mg / kg ) of apomorphine , which preferentially activate presynaptic dopamine autore - ceptors , eiicited yawning . Whereas apomorphine , at a high dose of 2 mg / kg , produces stereotypy which has been thought to be mediated by stimulation ofpostsyn - aptic dopamine receptors . The yawning and stereotypy did not occur simultaneously in the rat . The apomorphine - induced yawning was completely inhi - bited by pretreatment with fluphenazine ( 9 mg / kg , IM ) or scopolamine ( 0 . 5 mg / kg IP ) , but markedly increased by reserpine ( 5 mg / kg , SC ) , however it was not affected by methyiscopolamine ( 0 . 5 mg / kg , IP ) . Both physostig - mine ( 0 . 2 mg / kg , IP ) , an indirect ace @ choline agonist , and pilocarpine ( 4 mg / kg , P ) , a direct ace @ choline agonist , also induced yawning . Th : is was aboiished by scopolamine ( 0 . 5 mg / kg , IP ) and increased by reserpine ( 5 mg / kg , SC ) . Fluphenazine ( 9 mg / kg , ! P ) did not affect the pilocarpine - induced yawning but increased the physostigmine - induced yawning . The results in - dicate that apomorphine elicits yawning by stimulating presynaptic dopamine receptors , and that dopaminer - gic inhibition and cholinergic activation are concom - itantly involved in the yawning . Key words : " Yawning - Apomorphine - Physostigmine - Pilocarpine - Dopaminergic neu - rons - - Cholinergic neurons It has been reported that the characteristic yawning behavior appears after intracerebral iNection of adreno - corscotrophic hormone ( ACTH ) , meianocyte - stimulating hormone ( MSH ) or fi - lipotrophic hormone ( / 3 - LPH ) in many animals , such as monkeys , dogs , cats , Ojj } ) rint reqz4ests to : K . Yamada rabbits , rats and mice ( Gessa et ai . , 1966 ; Baldwin et al . , 1974 ; Gispen et al . , 1975 ; Rees et al . , 1976 ) . In infant rats , cholinergic agonists also elicited yawning ( Urbfi - Holmgren et al . , 1977 ) , suggesting that yawning is due to cholinergic stimulation . However , few studies have been made on the neurological mechanisms involved in yawning which still remain to be elucidated . There is evidence that catalepsy elicited by neuro - ieptic agents , which are dopamine antagonists , is blocked by antichoIinergic agents ( Costa ! l and Oliey , 97I ; Ma et a ! . , ! 976 ) , and that the nigro - striatal dopaminergic neurons inhibit the striata ! cholinergic neurons ( Trabucchi et al . , 1975 ; Agid et al . , ~ 975 ; Roth arid Bunney , 1976 ) . Apomorphine may be a direct - acting dopamine receptor agonist ( And6n et al . , ~ 967 ; Carlsson , I975 ) , and , a : ; a ! ow dose , produces an inlhibition of dopamine release from presynaptic sites that results in activation of cholinergic neurons ( Carlsson , ~ 975 ; Chiara et al . , 1976 ) . Consequently apomorphine , at a low dose , ought to elicit yawning . In the present investigation , we 5ound that apomor - phine did elicit yawning in adult rats and we attempted further to understand the neurological mechanism involved . Materials and Methods At ~ mvaLr . Healthy male Wistar rats ( 250 - 300 g ) were obtained from Kyudo Animal Laboratory ( Kumamoto , Japan ) . They were per - mitted food ( MF , Oriental Yeast Ltd . ) and water ad libitnm except during triais . All trials and breeding were carried out at an environmental temperature of 23 _ + 1 - ' C , with a ! 2 h light - dark cycle ( 7 : 00 a . m 7 : 00 p . m . ) . / Jeasm ' ement . Pairs of rats were placed h ~ transpare * ~ t plastic boxes ( 35 (cid:141) 30 (cid:141) { 7 cm ) containing wood shavings . Yawns were counted for 60 rain after ! P injection of saline , apomorphine , physostigmine or pilocarpine . Stereotypy was rated at 20 rain after saline or apomor - : obine according to the scale of Costall and Nayler ( ~ 973 ) : ( 0 ) normal behavior ; ( 1 ) exploratory activity , discontinuous sniffing ; ( 2 ) con - thmous sniffing ; ( 3 ) continuous sniffing , discontinuous licking or biting ; ( 4 ) coxatinuous licking or biting . 0033 - 3158 / 80 / 0067 / 0039 / $ 0 ! . 00 40 Psychopharmacology 67 ( 1980 ) Administration of Drugs . To induce yawning , rats received in - traperitoneal injections of apomorphine at doses ranging from 0 . 05 - 4 mg / kg , physostigmine at 0 . 2 mg / kg or pilocarpine at 4 mg / kg . The time interval between pretreatment with the following drugs and injection of the yawning - inducers was 24h or 14 days for fluphen - azine enanthate ( 9 mg / kg , IM ) , 24 h for fluphenazine decanoate ( 9 mg / kg , IM ) aad reserpine ( 5 mg / kg , SC ) , 30 min for scopolamine ( 0 . 5 mg / kg , IP ) and methylscopolamine ( 0 . 5 mg / kg , IP ) . In the control experiments , saline instead of the drug was injected at the same time interval . Drugs . The following drugs were used : Apomorphine hydrochloride ( Sandoz , A . G . ) , fluphenazine enanthate ( Squibb ) , fluphenazine decanoate ( Squibb ) ~ reserpine ( Apoplon Injection , Daiichi Pharmaceutical ) , scopolamine hydrobromide ( Nakarai Chemicals ) , scopolamine methylbromide ( Nakarai Chemicals ) , physostigmiue salicylate ( Merck ) , pilocarpine hydrochloride ( Nakarai Chemicals ) . Flnphenazine enanthate and fluphenazine decanoate were dissolved in sesame oil and administered intramuscularly ( IM ) using 0 . 5 ml syrings ( 0 . 1 ml / 100 g ) . The other drugs were dissolved in saline and injected intraperitoneally ( IP ) or subcutaneously ( SC ) , into experi - mental animals . Statistical Analysis ' . Yawning responses and stereotypy scores were expressed as mean values , and statistical analysis was calculated using the two - tailed Mann - Whitney U - test ( Siegel , 1956 ) .

The rats showed recurrent episodes of yawn - ing with or without penile erections after injection of tow doses ofapomorphine . Each yawn was preceded by grooming or chewing or sometimes by sudden stretch - ing of the forelimbs . The yawning began within 5 rain of injection and was marked after 10 - 20rain . These responses to apomorphine were most pronounced at a dose of 0 . 25 mg / kg , the incidence of yawning at this dose was 87 . 5 ~ and the mean number of yawns in 60 min was 4 . At high doses apomorphine induced a dose - dependent stereotypy , characterized by slight sniffing at a dose of 0 . 5 mg / kg of apomorphine and by continuous licking and biting at a higher dose of 2 . 0 mg / kg . These responses were greatest 20 min after injection . The yawning and stereotypy did not appear simultaneously . The influence of the following drugs on yawning were studied next : Fluphenazine enanthate ( 9 mg / kg , IM ) , fluphenazine decanoate ( 9 mg / kg , IM ) , scopol - amine ( 0 . 5 mg / kg , IP ) , methylscopolamine ( 0 . 5 mg / kg , IP ) or reserpine ( 5 mg / kg , SC ) . Yawning was seldom observed in the control groups pretreated with these drugs and saline , the mean numbers of yawns during 60 rain being 0 . 5 ( n = 14 ) , 1 . 3 ( n = 14 ) , 0 ( n = 8 ) , 1 . 6 ( n = 8 ) and 1 . 7 ( n = 14 ) , respectively . As shown in Fig . 2 , yawning induced by 0 . 25 mg / kg of apomorphine was blocked by fluphenazine en - anthate , fluphenazine decanoate or scopolamine but not by methylscopolamine , whereas the yawning Drugs ( mg / kg ) Saline Apornorphioe 0 . 25 FZ - Enanthate 9 + Apo . 0 . 25 fZ - Oeeanoate 9 + Apo . 0 . 25 Scopolamine 0 . 5 + Apo , 0 . 25 Yawns in 60rnin ( mean ) 2 4 ; i i i p , ~ J = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ~ ( 1 ~ ) . : . : . : : ' . : : ' i : : : : : - : : : : - - : : . > : . _ . . : . : . : . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The incidence of yawning was 91 . 7 ~ and the mean number of yawns in 60 rain was 3 . 2 . Physostigmine - induced yawning was markedly inhibited by scopolamine but not by methylscopol - amine . On the other hand , yawning was increased by fluphenazine enanthate and reserpine . This increased yawning was accompanied by incessant chewing and marked protrusion of the tongue . As demonstrated in Fig . 4 , pilocarpine ( 4 mg / kg ) induced yawning . This began about ~ 0 rain after in - jection and was marked after 20 - 30 rain . The in . - cidence of yawning was 93 . 8 ~ and the mean number of yawns in 60 rain was 4 . 3 . Pilocarpine - induced yawning was markedly diminished by scopolamine bat not by methylscopolamine . Treatment with reserpine in - creased the pilocarpine - induced yawning , while flu - phenazine enanthate had no effect . DiSc ~ ISSiO ~ Low doses of apomorphine induced yawning without producing typical symptoms of behavioral excitation , such as stereotypy and hypermotility . Yawning was accompanied by penile erections which were similar to tkose seen in the sexuai arousal elicited by ACTH , MSH or fi - LPH in rats ( Colbern et al . , 1977 ) and rabbits ( Bertolini eta ! . , 1969 ; Baldwin eta ] . , 1974 ) . Higher doses of apomorphine produced stereotypy . It has been proposed that apomorphine exerts biphasic effects on behavior , i . e . , decrease of motor activity at iow doses , and stereotypy and hypermotility at higher doses ( Carlsson , 1975 ; Str6mbom . 1976 ; Chiara et al . , 1976 ) . It has also been reported that low doses of apomorphine preferentially activate presynaptic do - pamine autoreceptors , which results in an inhibition of dopamine release and consequent decrease in its syn - thesis , whereas higher doses stimulate postsynaptic receptors ( Roberts et al . , 1975 ; Groves et al . , 1975 ; Waiters and Roth , 1976 ) . Accordingly , yawning elicited by ! ow doses of apomorphine seems to be due to an activation of presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors , while stereotypy induced by higher doses may be attributed to a stimulation of postsynaptic dopamine receptors as previousiy proposed ( Kelly et al . , 1975 ) . Apomorphine - induced yawning was not inhibited by the predominantly peripherally acting methyl - scopoiamine but was blocked by scopolamine , an antichotinergic agent . Physostigmine , an anticholines - terase agent , and pilocarpine , a direct acetylcholine agonist , also elicited yawning in adult rats , as observed previously in infant rats with cholinergic agents ( Urb ~ - Holmgren et al . , 1977 ) . This was abolished by scopol - amine but not by methylscopolamine , suggesting that yawning is mediated by activation of eholinergic neu - rons in the brain . Recently biiateral intranigrai in - jection of picrotoxin combined with SC injection of apomorphine , 0 . 2 mg / kg , was found to induce simul - taneous catalepsy and yawning in rats ( Olianas et al . , i978 ) , suggesting that the nigro - striatal dopaminergic neurons are involved . There is also accumulated evi - dence that the nigro - striatal dopaminergic neurons inhibit the striata ! cholinergic neurons ( Trabucchi et al . , ~ 975 ; Roth and Bunney , 1976 ; Choi and Roth , 1978 ) , while a dopaminergic - cho ! inergic link is lacking in the mesotimbic area such as the nucleus accumbens 42 Psychopharmacology 67 ( 1980 ) septi and tuberculum olfactorium ( Consolo et al . , 1977 , 1978 ) . Therefore , in apomorphine - induced yawning , in addition to an inhibition of dopamine release resulting from activation of presynaptic dopamine autorecep - tors , a consequent activation of cholinergic neurons seems to be concomitantly involved . Further studies on inhibitory and stimulative effects of certain drugs corroborate the present proposal that yawning may be induced through activation of cholin - ergic neurons which are regulated by dopaminergic neurons . Reserpine , an amine depletor ( Furukawa et al . , 1976 , 1979 ; Yamada and Furukawa , 1979 ) , mark - edly increased not only the apomorphine - induced yawning , with little increase in stereotypy , but also the physostigmine - and pilocarpine - elicited yawnings . This increase in yawning thus seems to be due to an inhibition of dopamine release resulting from a pre - synaptic depletion of dopamine produced by reserpine . On the other hand , fluphenazine , a long - acting neuroleptic , blocks both pre - and postsynaptic do - pamine receptors ( Nowycky and Roth , 1977 ; Choi and Roth , 1978 ; Yamada et al . , 1979 ) . In the present study , fluphenazine decreased the apomorphine - induced yawning , markedly increased the physostigmine - induced yawning , but failed to affect the pilocarpine - induced yawning . This inhibitory effect of the do - pamine antagonist on the apomorphine - induced yawn - ing can be explained by the blockade of presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors . While the effects of physo - stigmine , an indirect cholinergic agonist , seem to depend on the status of cholinergic neurons . Modifi - cation of the cholinergic system by dopaminergic agents can alter the effects of physostigmine ( Guyenet et al . , 1975 ; Dunstan and Jackson , 1977 ) . Accordingly , blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors by the dopamine antagonist and a consequent activation of cholinergic neurons may account for the stimulatory effect on the physostigmine - induced yawning . With regard to alteration of receptor sensitivity by long - term administration of a drug , it has been reported that chronic treatment with atropine for 21 days produced a supersensitivity to direct cholinergic agents ( Takeyasu et al . , 1979 ) , whereas repeated injections of haloperidol ( Dunstan and Jackson , 1977 ) or treatment with 6 - hydroxydopamine ( Kato et al . , 1978 ) , elicited a cho - linergic hyposensitivity as a consequence of hyper - activity of cholinergic neurons which are regulated by dopaminergic neurons . However , since fluphenazine failed to potentiate the pilocarpine - induced yawning in this study , it seems not to induce an alteration in postsynaptic sensitivity to direct acetylcholine agonists after 24 h . From these results , it is suggested that the sites of action of neuroleptics on pre - or postsynaptic do - pamine receptors can be determined by observing their inhibitory or stimulatory effects on yawning induced by apomorphine or physostigmine . The yawning elicited by intracranial injection of peptides , such as ACTH , MSH and fi - LPH , appeared with a time lag of about 40 - 60 min and then lasted for 1 - 2 h ( Ferrari , 1958 ; Ferrari et al . , 1963 ; Gessa et al . , 1967 ; Izumi et al . , 1973 ; Baldwin et al . , 1974 ) . ACTH and MSH were also considered to activate cholinergic neurons in the brain ( Torda and Wolff , 1952 ; Marx , 1975 ) . In fact , the ACTH - induced yawning was sup - pressed by chlorpromazine or atropine ( Ferrari et al . , 1963 ) suggesting a possible involvement of dopaminer - gic and cholinergic neurons . It is therefore probable that the effect of the peptides may involve other neurological mechanisms , presumably dopaminergic and / or cholinergic neurons , when they elicit yawning behavior .
