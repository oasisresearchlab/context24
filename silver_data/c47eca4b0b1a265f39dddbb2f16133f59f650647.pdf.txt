We analyzed a coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) outbreak involving three 46 families in a restaurant in Guangzhou , China , assessed the possibility of airborne 47 transmission , and characterized the associated environmental conditions . We collected 48 epidemiological data , obtained a full video recording and seating records from the restaurant , 49 and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the 50 index case . Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled 51 droplets . We compared the in - room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the 52 simulated virus - laden aerosol tracer . The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer gas 53 concentration decay method . This outbreak involved ten infected persons in three families ( A , 54 B , C ) . All ten persons ate lunch at three neighboring tables at the same restaurant on January 55 24 , 2020 . None of the restaurant staff or the 68 patrons at the other 15 tables became infected . 56 During this occasion , the measured ventilation rate was 0 . 9 L / s per person . No close contact 57 or fomite contact was identified , aside from back - to - back sitting in some cases . Analysis of 58 the airflow dynamics indicates that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread 59 pattern representative of long - range transmission of exhaled virus - laden aerosols . Airborne 60 transmission of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus is possible in crowded space with a ventilation rate of 61 1 L / s per person . 62 Keywords : COVID - 19 , SARS - CoV - 2 , airborne transmission , aerosol transmission , building 63 ventilation 64 65 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 1 . Introduction 66 Following a debate of airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 ( Morawska and Cao , 2020 ) , the 67 virus that causes COVID - 19 , in the continuing COVID - 19 pandemic , leading health 68 authorities have recognized the importance of airborne transmission in special settings since 69 October 2020 ( US CDC , 2020 ; WHO , 2020 ) . The well - known Wells - Riley equation ( Riley et 70 al . 1978 ) suggests the importance of sufficient building ventilation in diluting the infectious 71 aerosols . However , the effective minimum ventilation rate for avoiding airborne transmission 72 remains unknown . Existing ventilation standards such as ASHRAE 62 . 1 ( 2019 ) do not 73 consider infection control as their objectives . The Wells - Riley equation or its variants may 74 be used to determine the minimum ventilation rate if the quanta generation rate is known , 75 however , significant uncertainty exists in the existing available quanta generation data for 76 COVID - 19 ( Buonanno et al . 2020 ; Dai and Zhao , 2020 ; Miller et al . 2021 ) . Measurement of 77 ventilation rates in the infection venue of an outbreak has been challenging due to difficulties 78 in identification of an airborne outbreak , and difficulties in immediate access to infection 79 venue and data availability of infectors and susceptible in infection venue at the time of 80 infection . 81 Here we report a detailed epidemiological and environmental study of a restaurant outbreak 82 in Guangzhou , China . The COVID - 19 outbreak was identified in early 2020 and linked to 83 three seemingly non - associated clusters of unrelated families ( A , B , C ) ( Lu et al . 2020 ) . 84 Families B ( n = 4 ) and C ( n = 7 ) comprised local Guangzhou residents with no history of 85 travel to or encounters with inhabitants from Hubei , but nevertheless three members of family 86 B and two members of family C were confirmed to be infected with SARS - CoV - 2 on 87 February 4 or 6 , at which time only 322 cases of infection ( 98 local cases and 224 imported 88 cases ) had been confirmed in the city of nearly 13 million residents . 89 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 Local health officials learned that families B and C had eaten lunch at the same restaurant on 90 Chinese New Year’s Eve ( January 24 , 2020 ) , as had family A ( n = 10 ) from Wuchang , 91 Wuhan ( the epicenter of the Chinese epidemic ) , who had arrived in Guangdong by train on 92 January 23 . One person from family A reported experiencing the onset of COVID - 19 93 symptoms on January 24 , and video records from the restaurant show that families A , B , and 94 C were seated at tables along the exterior window , with family A’s table in the center . None 95 of the restaurant waiters or remaining 68 patrons distributed at 15 other tables became 96 infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . Families A , B , and C had not met previously and did not have 97 close contact during the lunch , aside from some patrons sitting back - to - back . 98 Our field measurement of ventilation was performed in the restaurant with the original table 99 setup on March 19 – 20 . To investigate the possibility of airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 100 2 , we also analyzed the spatial distribution data from this outbreak using computational fluid 101 dynamics ( CFD ) simulations . We use our results to assess the ventilation conditions of 102 airborne transmission . 103 2 . Methods 104 2 . 1 . Epidemiologic analysis 105 We obtained the seating arrangement of the three family members and remaining patrons in 106 Restaurant X as well as the dates of COVID - 19 symptom onset , where the symptom onset 107 date is defined as the day when symptoms ( e . g . , fever or cough ) were first noticed by the 108 patient . SARS - CoV - 2 infection was confirmed by real - time polymerase chain reaction with 109 reverse transcription ( RT - PCR ) analysis of throat swabs . Demographic data , travel history , 110 exposure history , and symptoms of the infected individuals were collected ( Lu et al . 2020 ) . 111 We also obtained the floor plan and design of the air conditioning and ventilation system of 112 the restaurant , and the hourly weather data for January 24 from a weather station near the site . 113 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 Full closed - circuit television camera records of the restaurant and elevator were reviewed to 114 determine the elevator use by patrons , the fire - door use by both patrons and waiters , the table 115 and seating arrangement during the lunch , and any close contact behavior between Family A 116 and others . 117 Restaurant X has five floors . The outbreak occurred on the third floor , which has a volume of 118 431 m 3 ( height of 3 . 14 m , length of 17 m , and average width of 8 . 1 m ) ( Figure 1 ) . Large and 119 small tables have a diameter of 1 . 8 m and 1 . 2 m , respectively , and rectangular tables measure 120 0 . 9 m · 0 . 9 m and 1 . 2 m · 0 . 9 m . Five fan coil air - conditioning units are installed on the third 121 floor , and there is no outdoor air supply : ventilation is thus achieved using only infiltration 122 and natural ventilation through an occasionally open door driven by buoyancy forces and an 123 exhaust fan installed inside the restroom . Four exhaust fans are installed on the south glass 124 window but were not used during this lunch . At noon on January 24 , the third floor of the 125 restaurant had 18 tables and 89 patrons . We label tables A , B , and C as TA , TB , and TC , 126 respectively , and the remaining tables are labeled as T4 – T18 ( Figure 1 ) . According to video 127 analyses , the fire door was used approximately every 2 min . 128 129 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 130 Figure 1 . ( Color Online ) Distribution of SARS - CoV - 2 infection cases at tables in Restaurant 131 X . The probable air - flow zones are shown in dark grey and light grey . Eighty - nine patrons 132 are shown at the 18 tables , with one table being empty ( T04 ) . Tables TA , TB , and TC are 133 where families A , B , and C sat , some of whose members became infected . Patient A1 at TA 134 is the suspected index case , who had symptoms shortly after returning to the hotel where 135 Family A was staying . Patients A2 – A5 , B1 – B3 , and C1 – C2 are the individuals who became 136 infected . Other tables are numbered as T04 – T18 . Each of the five air - conditioning units ( fan 137 coil units ) condition a particular zone . Patrons and waiters entered the restaurant floor via the 138 elevator and stairwell , which are connected by the fire door . 139 140 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 We studied the infection data with regards to seating location and used a chi - square test to 141 explore the association between a patron’s location ( i . e . , table ) and his / her probability of 142 becoming infected . Table A was excluded in this analysis . The other tables were categorized 143 according to two criteria : distance from TA ( e . g . , immediate vs . remote neighbors ) and air - 144 conditioning zone . The ABC zone was that immediately around TA , TB , and TC and 145 serviced by one air conditioning unit , and the non - ABC zone was everywhere else , serviced 146 by the four other air conditioning units . 147 2 . 2 . Experimental tracer gas measurements and computational fluid - dynamics 148 simulations 149 Tracer gas measurements and computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) simulations were used to 150 predict the spread of fine droplets exhaled by the index case and the detailed airflow pattern 151 in the restaurant . The CFD simulation models were the same as those used in previous studies 152 of two 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) outbreaks in 153 Hong Kong ( Li et al . 2005 ; Wong et al . 2004 ; Yu et al . 2004 ) . 154 The tracer measurement was carried out on March 19 – 20 when the intensity of the direct 155 solar radiation was similar to that on January 24 , i . e . , weak sunshine , with clouds and rain . 156 We first measured the supply / return / exhaust air flow and temperature at each air - conditioning 157 unit and at the exhaust fan in the restroom . We arranged the tables and chairs to match the 158 arrangement used at the January 24 lunch , as determined by the video analyses . The air 159 conditioning units were turned on and the exhaust fans in the vertical glass window were left 160 off to simulate the air - flow conditions at the time of SARS - CoV - 2 infection during the lunch 161 on January 24 . Volunteers were not recruited because the experiment was performed during 162 the strict intervention ( i . e . , partial lockdown ) phase of the epidemic in Guangzhou . However , 163 nine of our team members volunteered to sit at tables A , B , and C and simple thermal 164 mannequins were placed at the others . The mannequins were warm and hollow , containing a 165 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 60 - W electrical bulb enclosed by a stainless steel cylinder , which produced warm plumes 166 similar to those produced by the human volunteers . A 60 - W electrical bulb was also used to 167 simulate warm food on each table . 168 The tracer gas measurement consisted of two stages . In the first stage , we released ethane gas 169 through an 8 - mm inner diameter pipe at a speed of 1 . 5 m / s at 32 – 34 °C , with the pipe outlet 170 placed immediately above the index case’s nose . This mode of release mimicked the index 171 case ( assumed to be A1 ) talking and moving their head around . Tracer gas is known to be an 172 effective surrogate for modeling the spread of fine droplets or droplet nuclei ( Bivolarova et al . 173 2017 ) . In the first of two experiments , we monitored the gas concentrations at 14 points , 174 namely all of the chairs where the infected members of families B and C had sat ( Figure C . 1 ) . 175 In the second experiment , gas concentrations were only monitored at seven points , owing to 176 the time required for rotational sampling at each point . 177 In the second stage , the ventilation rate was measured using the tracer concentration decay 178 method , which involved the release of a tracer gas into the restaurant and subsequent mixing 179 with the flow from 10 desk fans . We measured the tracer concentration at three points in the 180 room . The elevator and fire door were opened every 2 min to mimic the traffic that was 181 observed in the recording of the January 24 lunch , with the fire door closing automatically 182 after a period of 3 s . We identified an exhaust flow through the doorway of the restroom and 183 bidirectional air exchange through the opening and closing of the fire door . The non - 184 operating exhaust fans were sealed relatively well , with nearly negligible air flow . After the 185 measurements , we assigned the health status ( ill vs . healthy ) of each person at non - A tables 186 as the dependent variable and applied a binary logistic regression model to investigate the 187 association between the measured concentrations of tracer gas and infection probability . 188 We adopted the widely used CFD software package Fluent ( Ansys Fluent , USA ) , which is a 189 three - dimensional , general - purpose CFD software package for modeling fluid flows . We used 190 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 the basic renormalization - group ( RNG ) k - ε turbulence model to simulate the effects of 191 turbulence on airflow and dispersion of pollutants . We assumed that the virus - laden water 192 droplets generated from the index case at TA rapidly evaporated ( i . e . , after a few s in air ) . We 193 first approximated the exhaled droplet nuclei as a passive scalar , as in the experiments , and 194 the deposition effect was therefore neglected . The prediction was then compared to the 195 measured value . Next , we considered the deposition of droplet nuclei ( using a drift - flux 196 model of Holmberg and Li , 1998 ) , filtration of the air conditioning units ( with a filtration 197 efficiency of 20 % following a preliminary measurement on site ) , and deactivation of the virus 198 in aerosols ( Van Doremalen et al . 2020 ) , and predicted the temporal concentration profiles of 199 the droplet nuclei containing the virus , which was then used to calculate the total exposure at 200 each table . Only a representative droplet nuclei size of 5 m m is modeled , and its surface 201 deposition was ignored as the deposition loss of fine droplet nuclei is significantly small 202 compared to virus deactivation ( Miller et al . 2021 ) . After CFD modeling , we used the health 203 status ( ill vs . healthy ) of each person at non - A tables as the dependent variable and applied a 204 binary logistic regression model to investigate the association between the predicted 205 concentration of tracer gas and predicted exposure to droplet nuclei and infection probability . 206 3 . Results 207 3 . 1 . The outbreak 208 Detailed epidemiological , clinical , laboratory , and genomic findings for this outbreak and all 209 of the associated patients have been described in detail by Lu et al . ( 2020 ) . The first 210 confirmed case ( A1 ) from family A , who was confirmed on January 24 , is assumed to be the 211 index case ( Figure 1 ) . Patient A1 first had symptoms of a fever and cough in the late 212 afternoon of January 24 ( Figure 2A , Table A . 1 ) . The last patient was confirmed on February 213 6 ( Figure 2B ) . The three families occupied the restaurant at different times ( family A 12 : 01 – 214 13 : 23 ; family B 11 : 37 – 12 : 54 ; and family C 12 : 03 – 13 : 18 ) . According to the video analysis , 215 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 there was no significant close contact between the three families in the elevator or restroom 216 ( Supplementary information B ) . Contact tracing identified 68 patrons on the third floor at the 217 same time as families A , B , and C , and 102 patrons on other floors . We also identified 57 218 workers in the restaurant including 8 on the third floor , a taxi driver who had A1 as a 219 customer on the afternoon of January 24 , and 11 workers in the hotel where family A stayed . 220 The hotel is within walking distance of the restaurant . All of these close contacts were 221 identified after February 7 . Only 11 non - infected members of families A , B , and C were 222 quarantined in a central facility ; throat swab samples were taken but yielded negative results 223 for SARS - CoV - 2 . The 8 restaurant workers on the third floor , 11 hotel workers , and 19 224 patrons at other third - floor tables were home quarantined for 14 days and their symptoms 225 were continuously monitored . The remaining identified contacts were only followed up by 226 telephone and none reported any symptoms . Thus , only the 10 patrons in the restaurant were 227 infected , comprising the index case and nine others , including the five members of families B 228 and C who are assumed to have been infected at this lunch due to exposure to exhaled 229 droplets from the index case that contained virus particles . Families B and C had no close 230 contact with any known COVID - 19 patients and / or visitors from Hubei Province 14 days 231 prior to the onset of their symptoms ( Figure D . 1 ) . Although various scenarios of transmission 232 are possible ( e . g . , C2 may have become infected while caring for C1 ) , Lu et al ( 2020 ) 233 determined that at least one member from both families B and C was exposed to SARS - CoV - 234 2 at the restaurant . 235 236 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 ( A ) ( B ) Figure 2 . ( Color Online ) Dates of ( A ) symptom onset and ( B ) confirmation of the 10 patients 237 from the three families . Patients from family A , B , C are represented by yellow , red and blue 238 squares respectively . 239 The arrival and departure times of patrons at all tables are listed in Table 1 . Upon arriving at 240 the restaurant , families A , B , and C took the elevator to the third floor and did not remain in 241 the reception area , as they had previously booked tables . Family A used the elevator in two 242 groups . One patron from T18 shared the lift with the first group . The second comprised the 243 remaining two members of family A . Families B and C and patient C1 used the elevator 244 separately . 245 Shortly after being seated , patient A4 and two unaffected females of family A left their table 246 to use the restroom . During the meal , patient A4 left the table two additional times to go to 247 the catering room to retrieve new chopsticks or a spoon . An unaffected male member of 248 family C used the restroom shortly after sitting down and overlapped there for 1 min with 249 three members of family A . Some members of the three families used the restroom 250 immediately prior to leaving the restaurant . No sharing of items ( e . g . , a kettle ) was observed 251 between the three tables and no conversations occurred between the three families . During 252 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 the meal , the patrons at TA were active , with instances of members standing up and talking to 253 the left and right , whereas patrons at TB and TC were comparatively inactive . 254 Table 1 Arrival , departure , and overlap time . 255 Table Arrival ( first patron at table ) Departure Lunch duration ( min ) Starting exposure Overlap with Table A ( min ) Total exposure time ( min ) Period of exposure after Table A’s departure ( min ) TA 12 : 01 13 : 23 82 12 : 01 82 82 0 TB 11 : 37 12 : 54 77 12 : 01 53 53 0 TC 12 : 03 13 : 18 75 13 : 00 75 77 0 T05 11 : 32 12 : 53 81 12 : 01 52 52 0 T06 11 : 36 13 : 23 107 12 : 01 82 82 0 T07 11 : 29 13 : 10 101 12 : 01 69 69 0 T08 12 : 28 13 : 37 69 12 : 28 55 69 14 T09 11 : 47 13 : 16 89 12 : 01 75 75 0 T10 11 : 07 13 : 28 141 12 : 01 82 82 5 T11 11 : 32 13 : 11 99 12 : 01 70 70 0 T12 12 : 13 13 : 17 64 12 : 13 64 64 0 T13 11 : 53 12 : 51 58 12 : 01 50 50 0 T14 11 : 23 13 : 02 99 12 : 01 61 61 0 T15 11 : 55 13 : 30 95 12 : 01 82 89 7 T16 11 : 24 12 : 49 85 12 : 01 48 48 0 T17 13 : 00 14 : 19 79 13 : 00 23 79 56 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 T18 11 : 34 13 : 18 104 12 : 01 77 77 0 256 257 3 . 2 . Spatial distribution analysis of infection cases 258 The tables and patrons were first categorized by distance from TA , as immediate neighbors 259 ( TB , TC , and T18 ) or remote neighbors ( tables T4 – 17 ) . The 10 patients who were shortly 260 thereafter confirmed as having COVID - 19 sat at one of the three tables by the window . Three 261 of the four members of family B were infected , and two of the seven members of family C 262 were infected . Five members of family A were also infected , including the index case . The 263 two patrons at TC who sat the closest to TA were not infected , nor were any patrons at the 264 remote neighboring tables , but the patrons at neighboring tables had a higher infection 265 probability than patrons at remote tables ( χ 2 = 16 . 08 , P < 0 . 001 , chi - squared test with 266 continuity correction , Table 2 ) . The infection risk was also higher for patrons at zone - ABC 267 tables than those at non - ABC zone tables ( χ 2 = 25 . 78 , P < 0 . 001 ) . None of the patrons seated 268 in the non - ABC zone were infected . 269 270 Table 2 . Number of cases and susceptible patrons at non - A tables in different zones of 271 Restaurant X .

Table A patrons left the restaurant at time 4920 s ( 1 : 22 PM ) . Due to the nature of 301 the air flows , the concentrations for some patrons continued to rise after 4920 s . The results 302 are used to calculate the exposure using the exposure duration data in Table 3 . The prediction 303 concentration profiles clearly show a separated ABC zone ( i . e . , bubble , including T04 , which 304 had no patrons ) , a T17 / T18 zone , a zone with T11 and T13 – 16 , and a zone with T07 – T10 and 305 T12 close to the outdoor air supply . 306 307 3 . 3 . Ventilation and dispersion of exhaled droplet nuclei 308 The results of the two tracer gas decay experiments show that the air exchange rate was only 309 0 . 77 air changes per hour ( ACH ) at 16 : 00 – 17 : 00 and 0 . 56 ACH at 18 : 00 – 19 : 30 ( Figure C . 2 ) . 310 For a volume of 431 m 3 and 89 patrons , this is equivalent to an outdoor air supply of 1 . 04 and 311 0 . 75 L / s per patron , respectively . The average measured ventilation rate is 0 . 9 L / s per person . 312 The predicted contaminated cloud envelope in the ABC zone is shown in Figure 3 . The 313 exhaled air stream from the index case rises in the zone with families A , B , and C , following 314 the interaction of thermal plumes and the air jet of the air conditioning ( Figure 4 ) . The high - 315 momentum air - conditioning jet carries the contaminated air at ceiling height . Upon reaching 316 the opposite glass window , the jet bends downward and returns at a lower height . At each 317 table , the rising thermal plumes from the warm food and people carry the contaminated air 318 upward , and the remaining air returns to the air - conditioning unit and forms a recirculation 319 zone or bubble , referred to as the ABC zone . Similarly , other air - conditioning units also 320 produce cloud envelopes , although these are not as distinct as that in the ABC zone , due to 321 mixing by the air - conditioning jet of the air - conditioning unit above T09 . Air exchange 322 occurs between all of the zones because there are no physical barriers between them . Spread 323 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 20 of exhaled droplet nuclei in the restaurant is also shown in an animation shown in Appendix 324 B as predicted by computational fluid dynamics . 325 Table 3 .

As expected , some mixing clearly occurred between the 334 different air - conditioning zones ( Figure 4 ) , although a stable higher concentration was 335 maintained in the ABC zone . The predicted normalized ethane concentrations agree well with 336 the measured values ( Figure 5 ) . 337 We use the predicted concentrations of infectious virus - containing droplet nuclei ( 5 m m ) in 338 the restaurant ( Figure 6 ) to calculate the exposure using the exposure duration data in Table 1 . 339 When the deposition , filtration , and virus deactivation are considered , the predicted 340 normalized time - averaged concentrations of the infectious virus - containing droplet nuclei ( 5 341 m m ) during the entire period of TA’s presence reveal the additional ABC bubble effect , i . e . 342 the concentrations at other tables become much lower than those at TA – TC ( Figure 7 ) . It 343 should be noted that if the deposition , filtration , and deactivation were not considered , there 344 would also be significant exposure for patrons at Table T17 due to their relative long duration 345 of stay in the restaurant . 346 The predicted normalized exposure to the exhaled infectious virus droplet nuclei of all tables 347 are also listed in Table 3 . According to the results of the logistic regression model , a higher 348 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 22 measured concentration of tracer gas is associated with a higher risk of acquiring COVID - 19 349 ( odds ratio associated with a 1 % increase in concentration : 1 . 115 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 009 – 1 . 232 ; P = 350 0 . 033 ) ( Table 1 ) . Similarly , a higher predicted concentration of tracer gas and higher 351 predicted exposure of the infectious virus - containing droplet nuclei ( 5 m m ) are associated 352 with a higher risk of acquiring COVID - 19 ( odds ratio associated with a 1 % increase in tracer 353 gas concentration : 1 . 268 , 95 % CI : 1 . 029 – 1 . 563 , P = 0 . 026 ; odds ratio associated with a 1 % 354 increase in exposure of droplet nuclei : 1 . 079 , 95 % CI : 1 . 020 – 1 . 142 , P = 0 . 008 ) . 355 356 Figure 7 .

( Color Online ) Distances between index case A1 ( purple ) and the five infected 361 individuals of families B and C ( red ) . 362 363 4 . Discussion 364 4 . 1 Poor ventilation and air distribution led to the outbreak . 365 Lu et al . ( 2020 ) suggested that droplet transmission was the most likely primary cause of this 366 outbreak , but pointed out that the outbreak cannot be explained by droplet transmission alone 367 because the distances between the index case ( A1 ) and patrons at the other tables are all 368 greater than 1 m . We estimate that such distances may have been as great as 4 . 6 m ( Figure 8 ) . 369 The video records also reveal that the index case never turned their head toward TB during 370 the lunch . Lu et al . ( 2020 ) also suggested that “strong airflow from the air conditioner could 371 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 24 have propagated droplets from table C to table A , then to table B , and then back to table C , ” 372 but stopped short of pinpointing the role of airborne transmission due to the lack of 373 environmental data . The role of airborne transmission was first postulated by the Chinese 374 National Health Commission ( NHC ) ( Li and Gao , 2020 ) during the early phase of the 375 COVID - 19 epidemic in China ; however , no specific evidence is provided in the NHC’s 376 recommendation . 377 Our prediction shows that a contaminated recirculation bubble was created in the ABC zone 378 ( Figure 3 ) , which sustained a higher concentration of exhaled droplet nuclei from the index 379 case . The formation of individual circulation zones was due to the spatial configuration of the 380 restaurant and interaction of high - momentum air flow of the five air - conditioning units 381 ( Figure 4 ) . Within the ABC bubble , the infectious virus - containing droplet nuclei would have 382 had time to be deposited , filtered , and deactivated . This is supported by our computer 383 simulation with a measured filtration efficiency of 20 % of the 5 - m m droplet nuclei , which 384 showed that patrons A2 , B1 , and C2 were exposed to an average concentration of 0 . 8 , 385 whereas patrons at T17 and T19 were only exposed to an average concentration of 0 . 3 . The 386 overlap period for families A and B in the restaurant was 53 min ( between 12 : 01 and 12 : 54 ) 387 and 75 min for families A and C ( between 12 : 03 and 13 : 18 ) , which would have allowed 388 sufficient exposure time to the exhaled droplets . Patient C1 arrived late , at 12 : 32 , and had a 389 46 - min overlap with family A . That none of the waiters were infected can be attributed to 390 their relatively short exposure time to exhaled droplets from the index case . A relatively high 391 concentration of tracer gas was also measured at T17 and T18 due to their proximity to the 392 ABC recirculation bubble . Patrons at T17 had only 23 min of overlap with TA but continued 393 to be exposed to the remaining suspended droplet nuclei after family A had left the restaurant . 394 Nevertheless , a low level of exposure to the infectious virus - containing droplet nuclei was 395 predicted because the virus was not only deactivated in aerosols and also removed by 396 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 25 deposition and filtration of the air conditioning units as these virus - containing droplet nuclei 397 circulated within the ABC recirculation bubble . None of the patrons at this table ( n = 5 ) were 398 infected . Note that additional patrons or restaurant staff may have contracted COVID - 19 399 owing to exposure to the virus in Restaurant X but were asymptomatic , however , 400 asymptomatic infection was paid little attention at the time . 401 However , the formation of a contaminated recirculation bubble in the ABC zone cannot alone 402 explain the outbreak . Further evidence comes from the low ventilation rates : the observed 403 high concentrations of the simulated contamination result from the lack of outdoor air supply . 404 The exhaust fans in the walls were found to be turned off and sealed during the January 24 405 lunch , meaning that there was no outdoor air supply aside from infiltration and infrequent and 406 brief opening of the fire door due to the negative pressure generated by the exhaust fan in the 407 restroom . This outdoor air was mainly distributed to the non - ABC zone , thus exacerbating 408 the ventilation deficit of the ABC zone . Ventilation in this study is defined as the supply of 409 outdoor air into the restaurant , and the distribution of the supplied outdoor air in the 410 restaurant . Ventilation is different from air conditioning , however , the supply airflow of the 411 fan coil units , interacting with human body flows , governs the airflow pattern in the 412 restaurant . 413 The measured averaged ventilation rate of 0 . 90 L / s per patron in the restaurant is 414 considerably lower than the 8 – 10 L / s per person required by most authorities or professional 415 societies ( American Society of Heating , Refrigerating and Air - Conditioning Engineers 416 Standard 62 . 1 , 2019 ) . The restaurant was also crowded and extra tables had been added to 417 accommodate the increased number of customers on Chinese New Year’s Eve . Consequently , 418 the occupant density was only 1 . 55 m 2 per patron , including the area occupied by tables . The 419 transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , which subsequently resulted in an outbreak of COVID - 19 , 420 thus occurred in a crowded and poorly ventilated space . 421 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 26 We also attempted to identify the role of fomite and close contact transmission by examining 422 individual trajectories during the patrons’ stay in the restaurant from the available video 423 records . We did not find any evidence to support exposure to SARS - Co - V2 via these routes 424 in this instance . 425 426 More than two thousands of superspreading events or outbreaks of COVID - 19 have been 427 documented by Swinkels ( 2020 ) , who also concluded that “nearly all SSEs [ super spreading 428 events ] in the database took place indoors . ” Qian et al ( 2020 ) identified 318 outbreaks each 429 with a minimum of 3 cases , comprising a total of 1245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural 430 cities in non - Hubei provinces , China , and found that none occurred in outdoor settings . High 431 attack rates of COVID - 19 have also been found in choir rehearsal ( Charlotte , 2020 ; Miller et 432 al . 2021 ) , homeless shelters ( Imbert et al . 2020 ; Ralli et al . 2021 ; Tobolowsky et al . 2020 ) ; 433 nightclubs ( Kang et al . 2020 ) ; Fitness centers ( Bae et al . 2020 ; Jang et al . 2020 ) and meat 434 processing plants ( Günther et al . 2020 ) . Although airborne transmission has been suspected in 435 many of these outbreaks , ventilation rates were not measured in the infection venues . 436 4 . 2 Estimation of quanta generation 437 Estimation of quanta generation in this outbreak is challenging as the flow is not fully mixed . 438 However , it might still be useful to offer an estimation based on the fully mixing condition . 439 The volume of air in the restaurant is 431 m 3 . The averaged air change rate during two 440 measurements were 0 . 67 h - 1 . We adopted an aerosol deposition rate of 0 . 3 h - 1 and virus 441 deactivation rate of 0 . 63 h - 1 ( Miller et al . 2021 ) . The pulmonary flow rate for restaurant 442 setting is 1 . 65 m 3 / h . As the effective air change rate is only 1 . 60 h - 1 , the transient Wells - Riley 443 equation needs to be used , which gives an estimated quanta generation rate of 79 . 3 quanta / h , 444 which is compared with 970 ± 390 quanta / h in a choir rehearsal outbreak ( Miller et al . 2021 ) , 445 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 27 about 5 . 0 quanta / h in light exercise with speaking conditions by Buonanno , et al . ( 2020 ) , and 446 14 - 48 quanta / h using a reproductive number - based fitting approach ( Dai and Zhao , 2020 ) . 447 According to Sun et al ( 2020 ) , “…infectiousness profile of a typical SARS - CoV - 2 patient 448 peaks just before symptom presentation” , which is also supported by other studies ( e . g . Cevik 449 et al . 2021 ; He et al . 2020 ; Wei et al . 2020 ) . Our estimated relatively large quanta generation 450 rate for the pre - symptomatic index case is also in agreement with this theory of peak 451 infectiousness just before the symptom presentation , as the index case only developed 452 symptoms after the lunch , and she seemed having not infected others elsewhere . 453 To ensure that there is less than one person to be infected in the restaurant , the estimated 454 minimum ventilation rate becomes 38 . 6 L / s per person using the estimated quanta value . This 455 estimated minimum ventilation rate is much larger than the required minimum ventilation 456 rate of 5 . 1 L / s per person in restaurants / dining rooms by international ventilation standards 457 such as ASHRAE 62 . 1 ( 2019 ) . 458 4 . 3 Importance of sufficiently low occupancy and other intervention 459 Lack of adequate ventilation and overcrowding is known to be associated with respiratory 460 infection outbreaks , although some are not commonly thought to be transmitted by aerosols . 461 This restaurant SARS - CoV - 2 outbreak resembles the Alaska plane influenza outbreak ( Moser 462 et al . 1979 ) , in which a plane with a 56 - seat passenger compartment was delayed by engine 463 trouble and no mechanical ventilation was provided during the 4 . 5 - h wait . The index case 464 was a passenger who became ill with influenza within 15 min after boarding the plane . There 465 was approximately 3 m 3 of compartment space per seat , and the provision of outdoor air was 466 only possible by the plane doors being open for some periods during the 4 . 5 - h wait and 467 during the movement of passengers in and out of the plane . According to Rudnick and Milton 468 ( 2003 ) , this resulted in there being only 0 . 08 – 0 . 40 L / s of air circulation per passenger , which 469 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 28 is slightly less than the range measured in Restaurant X , and this resulted in 72 % of the 54 470 passengers on board this plane being infected with influenza . 471 A systematic review by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) also found evidence for the 472 association between crowding and infection ( WHO , 2018 ) . During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic , 473 the basic reproduction number was as high as 3 . 0 – 3 . 6 in outbreaks in crowded schools , 474 compared to 1 . 3 – 1 . 7 in less crowded settings ( Lessler et al . 2009 ; Writing Committee , 2010 ) . 475 The SARS - CoV - 2 virus can survive in air for at least 3 h ( van Doremalen et al . 2020 ) and 476 airborne influenza virus genomes and viable influenza virus particles have been detected 477 ( Lindsley et al . 2012 , 2016 ; Xie et al . 2020 ; Yan et al . 2018 ) . 478 It is important to note that our results do not indicate that long - range airborne transmission of 479 SARS - CoV - 2 can occur in any indoor space , but rather that transmission may occur in a 480 crowded and poorly ventilated space . Gao et al . ( 2016 ) showed that the relative contribution 481 of aerosols to respiratory infection is a function of ventilation flow rate . A sufficiently high 482 ventilation flow - rate reduces the contribution of airborne transmission to a very low level , 483 whereas a low ventilation flow - rate leads to a relatively high contribution of aerosols to 484 transmission . For airborne transmission of respiratory infection such as COVID - 19 , the 485 infectious virus is carried by aerosols . These aerosols can be not only removed by ventilation , 486 but also by deposition and filtration , and the virus in aerosols can be deactivated , e . g . by 487 ultraviolet germicidal irradiation ( UVGI ) . Therefore , in addition to ventilation , effectiveness 488 of other aerosol removal , and / or virus deactivation methods should be explored . 489 In summary , our epidemiologic analysis , onsite experimental tracer measurements , and 490 airflow simulations support the probability of a long - range aerosol spread of the SARS - CoV - 491 2 having occurred in the poorly ventilated and crowded Restaurant X on January 24 , 2020 . 492 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 29 This conclusion has important implications for intervention methods in the ongoing COVID - 493 19 pandemic . Our study suggests that it is crucial to prevent overcrowding and provide good 494 ventilation and effective air distribution in buildings and transport cabins to prevent the 495 spread of SARS - CoV - 2 and the development of COVID - 19 . 496 497 Author contributions 498 Y .

The red seat indicates the 647 position of index case A1 . Small red - outlined circles indicate the seating location of the 648 infected patrons . Small blue circles indicate the location of the tracer gas sensors . The tables 649 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 38 are numbered TA , TB , and TC for families A , B , and C , respectively , and T04 – T18 for the 650 other tables . The morning test with a leak was unintended ; the tracer gas leaked due to a 651 damaged pipe below TA . Nevertheless , the measured data from test ( B ) also support the 652 observed distribution in test ( A ) . 653 654 655 Figure C . 2 ( Color Online ) Measured tracer gas concentration profile from the two tracer gas 656 decay tests for ventilation rate measurement . The concentrations were monitored at three 657 locations during each test : seat A2 , Table 10 ( T10 ) , and Table 16 ( T16 ) . For each test , the 658 three curves are reasonably close , suggesting the room air flow was reasonably fully mixed 659 by using the mixing fans during the test . 660 661 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 8 C o n c e n t r a t i o n ( p p m ) Time ( hr ) 1st test : A2 1st test : T16 1st test : T10 2nd test : A2 2nd test : T16 2nd test : T10 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 39 Appendix D : Guangzhou epidemiological data 662 663 Figure D . 1 ( Color Online ) The epidemiological curve in Guangzhou ( population12 . 9 664 million ) , where restaurant X is located and where families B and C live .
