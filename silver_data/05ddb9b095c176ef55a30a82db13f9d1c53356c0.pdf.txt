However , only a small proportion develops alcohol addiction . Individuals at risk often show a high sensation - seeking / low - anxiety behavioural phenotype . Here we asked which role EF hand domain containing 2 ( EFhd2 ; Swiprosin - 1 ) plays in the control of alcohol addiction - associated behaviours . EFhd2 knockout ( KO ) mice drink more alcohol than controls and spontaneously escalate their consumption . This coincided with a sensation - seeking and low - anxiety phenotype . A reversal of the behavioural phenotype with β - carboline , an anxiogenic inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist , normalized alcohol preference in EFhd2 KO mice , demonstrating an EFhd2 - driven relationship between personality traits and alcohol preference . These ﬁ ndings were con ﬁ rmed in a human sample where we observed a positive association of the EFhd2 single - nucleotide polymorphism rs112146896 with lifetime drinking and a negative association with anxiety in healthy adolescents . The lack of EFhd2 reduced extracellular dopamine levels in the brain , but enhanced responses to alcohol . In con ﬁ rmation , gene expression analysis revealed reduced tyrosine hydroxylase expression and the regulation of genes involved in cortex development , Eomes and Pax6 , in EFhd2 KO cortices . These ﬁ ndings were corroborated in Xenopus tadpoles by EFhd2 knockdown . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) in mice showed that a lack of EFhd2 reduces cortical volume in adults . Moreover , human MRI con ﬁ rmed the negative association between lifetime alcohol drinking and superior frontal gyrus volume . We propose that EFhd2 is a conserved resilience factor against alcohol consumption and its escalation , working through Pax6 / Eomes . Reduced EFhd2 function induces high - risk personality traits of sensation - seeking / low anxiety associated with enhanced alcohol consumption , which may be related to cortex function .

Interestingly , only a minority of chronic alcohol consumers of 7 – 15 % develop an addiction . 6 – 8 Others control their consumption and instrumenta - lization of the drug over lifetime . 9 , 10 Thus , there appear risk and resilience factors that make individuals prone or protect them from becoming addicted after they established regular drug consumption . These factors and their neuronal mediators are increasingly considered as predictors and targets for prevention strategies and possibly also for addiction treatment . 11 , 12 Gene expression pro ﬁ les of inbred short sleep vs inbred long sleep mice point towards a potential role of EF hand domain containing 2 ( EFhd2 , also known as Swiprosin - 1 ) protein coding gene D4Wsu27e as potential resilience factor for alcohol effects on sedation . EFhd2 expression was higher in the cerebellum of inbred long sleep compared to inbred short sleep mice , which were also more sensitive to the sedating effects of alcohol . 13 As a low sensitivity for alcohol effects is associated with higher consump - tion and increased risk for escalation of consumption , this would suggest that EFhd2 acts as a potential resilience factor against alcohol drinking establishment and possibly addiction . EFhd2 is a Ca 2 + sensor protein that was originally described in lymphocytes . 14 – 17 It consists of an N - terminal region of low complexity with an alanine stretch , a functional SH3 - binding motif , two functional EF hands and a C - terminal coiled - coil domain . 16 , 17 EFhd2 binds directly to F - actin and modulates its turnover by control of small GTPases and co ﬁ lin , suggesting that it might control synaptic plasticity . 18 – 21 EFhd2 is abundantly expressed in the human brain . 22 In mice , it is more abundant in adult than in embryonic brain . 23 It is predominantly found in neurons , with highest expression in the cortex and hippocampus , where it is localized in axons , dendrites and synaptic complexes . 22 , 23 Neurons of EFhd2 knockout ( KO ) mice show an increased axonal transport and recombinant EFhd2 can inhibit kinesin - mediated microtubule gliding . 23 Knockdown of EFhd2 increases pre - synaptic densities . 22 EFhd2 appears to be associated with various neurodegenerative diseases in mice and humans , which appears to be related to its low expression level in the cortex of dementia patients . 21 , 22 , 24 , 25 In contrast , enhanced cortical EFhd2 protein expression was linked to schizophrenia . 26 Although the molecular network role of EFhd2 suggests an involvement in behavioural plasticity , little is known about how EFhd2 impacts behaviour and how this translates to a role in psychiatric disorders . We hypothesized that EFhd2 is a resilience factor against the establishment of alcohol addiction - related behaviours , which may work by producing an addiction - prone personality trait by modulating transmitter systems involved in sensation - seeking and anxiety regulation in the brain . 27 – 29 MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Male and female EFhd2 KO mice on a C57BL / 6 background and wild - type ( WT ) mice 30 were studied in gender - balanced designs . Animals were housed in groups in standard macrolone cages ( Type III , Macrolone , Tecniplast , Hohenpeissenberg , Germany ) , or individually housed in these cages in all drinking studies . They were provided with food and water ad libitum , with paper towels as cage enrichment , and kept on a 12 : 12 h light : dark cycle ( lights on at 0700 hours ) . All mice were tested at an age of 2 – 6 month , with balanced age / gender in all experiments . Behavioural tests were performed during the light cycle between 0900 and 1600 hours . Room temperature was maintained between 19 and 22 °C at a humidity of 55 % ( ±10 % ) . All behavioural and neurochemical tests were performed by experimenters blind to hypothesis and / or genotype . All experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the humane treatment of animals and the European Communities Council Directive ( 86 / 609 / EEC ) and approved by the local governmental commission for animal health ( German state administration Bavaria / Regierung von Mittelfranken ) . Alcohol drinking and alcohol deprivation effect Alcohol drinking was tested in naive EFhd2 KO and WT mice using a two - bottle free - choice drinking paradigm . Animals were single housed for 3 month . Each cage was equipped with two bottles constantly available , one of which contained tap water and the other bottle contained alcohol in various concentrations . Bottle positions were changed daily . After an acclimatization period to establish a drinking baseline , animals received alcohol at increasing concentrations of 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 and 16 vol . % . Mice were exposed to each concentration of alcohol for 4 days . Thereafter , alcohol concentration was maintained at 16 vol . % and animals were allowed to drink for 15 days . To measure the alcohol deprivation effect , alcohol was removed for 3 weeks ( both bottles containing tap water ) before it was re - introduced with a concentration of 16 vol . % for 4 days . This procedure was repeated once more . Bottles were changed and weighed daily . The consumed amount of alcohol relative to body weight and the preference vs water were measured . 31 , 32 Taste preference test Alcohol experienced animals were used for this test 3 days after alcohol was replaced by water in the bottles . Sucrose ( 0 . 5 and 5 % ) and quinine ( 10 and 20 mg dl − 1 ) preference vs water was measured in a two - bottle free - choice test , where one bottle contained either sucrose or quinine and the other always water . Each dose was offered for 3 days with the position of the bottles being changed and weighed daily . 31 , 32 Loss of righting re ﬂ ex Alcohol naive animals were used for this test . Animals were administered with an alcohol injection of 3 . 5 g kg − 1 ( intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) ; v inj = 10 ml kg − 1 ) to induce a loss of the righting re ﬂ ex ( LORR ) , and immediately placed in an empty cage . A high dose was chosen for its known sedative effects in mice . 32 , 33 LORR was observed when the animal becomes ataxic and stopped moving for at least 30 s . The animal was then placed on its back . Recovery from alcohol administration was de ﬁ ned as the animal being able to right itself three times within a minute . A 2 h cutoff was used . Time taken for the animal to lose its righting re ﬂ ex and time to recovery from alcohol ’ s effect were recorded . 32 , 33 Blood alcohol determination Alcohol naive animals were used for this test . Mice received alcohol injections with a dose of 3 . 0 g kg − 1 ( i . p . , v inj = 10 ml kg − 1 ) , which had no sedative effects and allowed for ef ﬁ cient blood sampling , and 20 μ l blood samples were obtained from the submandibular vein 1 and 2 h after alcohol injection . The blood samples were directly mixed with 80 μ l 6 . 25 % ( w / v ) trichloroacetic acid . After centrifugation , 15 μ l of the supernatant was subjected to enzymatic alcohol determination using the alcohol dehy - drogenase method as described elsewhere . 32 , 33 Sensation - seeking and emotional behaviour Naive EFhd2 KO and WT mice were tested through a battery of behavioural tests in the following order : open ﬁ eld , elevated plus maze ( EPM ) , novelty - suppressed feeding , forced swim and sucrose preference tests . All tests were performed in separate days between 0900 and 1400 hours . Mice were tested in a pseudorandom order and were moved to the behavioural suite adjacent to the housing room immediately before testing . Each test apparatus was cleaned with 5 % ethanol between subjects to avoid any olfactory cues in ﬂ uencing behaviours . Mice were returned to their home cages at the end of each test and allowed to recover for at least 5 days before further testing ( for time line see : Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Behaviours for all tests were recorded on videotape for subsequent scoring . 34 , 35 Genetic base for sensation - seeking and alcohol addiction D Mielenz et al 2 Molecular Psychiatry ( 2017 ) , 1 – 17 Open ﬁ eld . Each mouse was placed in a square white acrylic arena ( 50×50 cm ) , facing an outer wall , for 20 min ( parameters were measured per 5 - min blocks and summarized ) and allowed to freely explore the arena . White light of 25 lx was evenly distributed across the arena during testing . Video recordings were taken and analysed using Biobserve Viewer III ( Biobserve , Bonn , Germany ) . A virtual square of equal distance from the periphery ( 36×36 cm ) was de ﬁ ned as the ‘ central zone ’ to determine the number of entries and time ( s ) spent in the central zone . Distance moved in the outer and central zones ( cm ) , number of entries , and time spent in the central zone were registered . 34 , 35 Elevated plus maze . The EPM was constructed from black opaque acrylic with white lining on the ﬂ oor , each arm measuring 30×5 cm and the central platform 5×5 cm . One set of arms , opposing one another , was enclosed completely by a wall of opaque acrylic , 15 cm high , whereas the other set was open with a ledge of 0 . 5 cm either side of the arms . The maze was elevated 50 cm from the ground on a transparent acrylic stand . Each mouse was placed on the central platform , facing towards a closed arm , and allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 min . Biobserve Viewer III tracking software ( Biobserve ) was used to record locomotor activity during the test ( distance moved in the open and closed arms ) , and the number of entries into the closed and open arms and time spent in them . An arm entry was counted when two paws had entered an arm , and an arm exit was determined when two paws had left the arm . 34 , 35 Novelty - suppressed feeding . Animals were deprived from food for 24 h before novelty - suppressed feeding test . After deprivation each mouse was put in the corner of a square white acrylic arena ( 50×50×50 cm ) , facing an outer wall . White light of 25 lx was evenly distributed across the arena during testing . A piece of food ( standard food for mice ; Sniff , Soest , Germany ; ~ 5 g ) was placed in the centre of the arena . Video recordings were taken and analysed using Biobserve Viewer III ( Biobserve ) . The time ( s ) before a mouse began eating after the fasting period ( 24 h ) and the distance moved before eating were registered . The cutoff time , which no animal reached , was 20 min . 34 , 35 Forced swim test . For the forced swim test , each mouse was placed into a glass transparent cylinder ( 17 - cm diameter , 18 - cm height ) ﬁ lled with water ( 12 cm , 25 °C ) for 15 min . Then , an animal was returned to the home cage . After 24 h , mice were again placed in this cylinder with water for 5 min . The latency of ﬁ rst ﬂ oating and total ﬂ oating time were recorded manually . 34 , 35 Sucrose preference test . Animals were single housed and had access to two bottles with water 7 days before the sucrose preference test . At day 8 , water in one bottle was replaced by 2 % sucrose solution , and the position of bottles with water and sucrose solution was changed daily during the next 5 days . The weight of animals was measured before and after the test , and volume of water and sucrose solution was estimated daily . Sucrose preference in % of drunken ﬂ uid during baseline and testing was calculated . Reversal of enhanced alcohol consumption We tested whether a pharmacological treatment that reverses the sensation - seeking / low - anxiety phenotype of EFhd2 KO mice would also reduce their alcohol consumption . To enhance anxiety - related behaviour , we used a chronic treatment with the well - established anxiogenic inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist , β - carboline - 3 - carboxylate ethyl ester ( β - CCE ; Sigma - Aldrich , Darmstadt , Germany ) or vehicle ( dimethylsulph - oxide : saline , 80 : 20 ) 36 applied by constant delivery by osmotic minipump to avoid the stress of chronic injections . Treatment allocation to the EFhd2 KO and WT mice was done randomly by drawing animal numbers . In a pretest , we determined a minipump delivery procedure based on previous protocols 37 and a dose of β - CCE , which was low enough to be anxiogenic in EFhd2 KO mice but without effect in WT mice . This was used for further testing . Naive EFhd2 and WT mice were deeply anaesthetised with iso ﬂ urane inhalation narcosis . In addition , 0 . 01 ml Rimadyl ( 5 mg kg − 1 Carprofen ) analgesia was given subcutaneously ( s . c . ) . Animals are implanted with an osmotic minipump ( ALZET Model 2006 ; Charles River , Sulzfeld , Germany ) into the back , administering β - CCE ( 1 . 5 mg kg − 1 per day ; s . c . ) for 42 days . After surgery , animals were single housed for 42 days in standard macrolone cages ( type III ) with two bottles available , each containing tap water . Eight to nine days after the start of the chronic β - CCE treatment , animals were tested for anxiety - related behaviour in the EPM as described above . Four days later , alcohol drinking was tested in a free - choice two - bottle drinking paradigm with increasing doses of alcohol ( 2 – 16 vol . % ) in one bottle , as described above . One day after testing , animals were killed and full delivery of minipump content was veri ﬁ ed . Conditioned place preference The establishment of conditioned place preference ( CPP ) was tested in naive EFhd2 KO and WT mice . The TSE Place Preference test boxes ( TSE Systems , Bad Homburg , Germany ) were made of non - transparent polyvinyl chloride with standard inside dimensions of 40 cm ( L ) ×15 cm ( W ) ×20 cm ( H ) . The apparatus was divided into three fully automated compartments ; the outer chambers measured 17 cm in length and the centre chamber 6 cm . The ﬂ oor of the left chamber ( compartment A ) was covered with a smooth black rubber mat . The ﬂ oor of the right chamber ( compartment B ) was covered with a patterned black rubber mat . The centre chamber was not covered and coloured white ( compartment C ) . Activity was recorded in each compartment using high - resolution infrared sensors . The system automatically recorded the number of entries made , the sojourn time and distance moved in each compartment for each trial . An unbiased design was used , that is , half the mice were conditioned to their preferred compartment , and half to their non - preferred compartment . 38 Animals were injected ( i . p . ) immediately before each trial with either saline or 2 g kg − 1 alcohol ( i . p . ) , a dose that has no sedative effects and that was previously shown to have ef ﬁ cient reinforcing effects in WT mice . 38 , 39 Mice were immediately transferred to the testing suite and placed into the CPP boxes , signifying the beginning of the trial period . The experiment involved four phases ; habituation trial ( one session ) , baseline testing ( Bl ) , conditioning trials ( 14 sessions ) and preference tests ( 3 sessions , T1 – T3 ) . Trials were performed once daily . Habituation . The habituation session was intended to acclimatize mice to the test procedure and apparatus prior to commencing the experiment . Mice were injected with saline and introduced into the centre compart - ment with free access to all three compartments for 20 min . Baseline test . The pretest was designed to establish a baseline level of preference for each individual animal . Mice were conditioned to either their preferred or non - preferred compartment using a counterbalanced experimental design . Mice were injected with saline and introduced into the centre compartment with free access to all three compartments for 20 min . Conditioning trials . Conditioning trials were performed in pairs ; odd numbered pairings were conditioned with alcohol and even numbered pairings were conditioned with saline , this was balanced across groups . All animals received seven pairings with saline and seven pairings with alcohol . Mice were injected with either saline or an ethanol solution and introduced into one of two compartments , with restricted access , for 5 min . Preference tests . To monitor the time course of CPP establishment , preference tests were systematically performed after one , three and seven conditioning trials . Before each test , mice were injected with saline and introduced into the centre compartment with free access to all three compartments for 20 min . 38 In vivo microdialysis Naive EFhd2 and WT mice were deeply anaesthetised with an i . p . injection using a mixture of 4 . 12 ml saline ( NaCl ) , 0 . 38 ml Ketaset ( containing 100 mg ml − 1 ketamine ) and 0 . 5 ml Domitor ( containing 1 mg ml − 1 medetomidine hydrochloride ) administered at 0 . 1 ml per 10 g body weight . In addition 0 . 01 ml Rimadyl ( 5 mg kg − 1 Carprofen ) analgesia was given s . c . The animal was placed in a Kopf stereotaxic frame . Two guide cannulas ( Microbiotech / se , Stockholm , Sweden ) were aimed at the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ; A : + 1 . 9 ; L : ±0 . 8 ; V : − 1 . 3 angle±10º from midline ) and the nucleus accumbens ( Nac ; A : + 1 . 2 ; L : ±1 . 6 ; V : − 4 . 3 angle±10º from midline ) using coordinates relative to bregma , 40 , 41 and ﬁ xed in place using two anchor screws ( stainless steel , d = 1 . 4 mm ) and dental cement . Thereafter , animals were kept warm and allowed to recover from the anaesthetic . Animals were then returned to their home cages and monitored daily , allowing at least 5 days for complete recovery . On the day of the experiment , microdialysis probes with membrane lengths of 2 mm for the PFC ( MAB 6 . 14 . 2 . ) and 1 mm ( MAB 6 . 14 . 1 . ) for the Genetic base for sensation - seeking and alcohol addiction D Mielenz et al 3 Molecular Psychiatry ( 2017 ) , 1 – 17 Nac were inserted into the guide cannulae under a short ( 3 – 5 min ) iso ﬂ urane anaesthesia and perfused with arti ﬁ cial cerebrospinal ﬂ uid ( containing Na + 147 mmol , K + 4 mmol , Ca 2 + 2 . 2 mmol , Cl − 156 mmol , pH = 7 . 4 ) . After probe insertion , the animal was placed into an open ﬁ eld ( 21×21×30 cm ) . Water was provided ad libitum and room temperature maintained between 19 and 22 ºC . Samples were collected every 20 min . Three samples were taken as baseline and the neurotransmitters dopamine ( DA ) , serotonin and noradrenaline were quanti ﬁ ed by high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection as described previously . 40 , 41 An injection of 2 g kg − 1 alcohol , a non - sedative dose known to have reinforcing properties and to drive monoaminergic responses in vivo , 31 , 32 was then administered i . p . and further eight samples were collected . Once microdialysis experiments were completed , animals were killed by cervical dislocation . Brains were collected and probe localization was veri ﬁ ed . Only mice with correct probe placement within the Nac and PFC according to Franklin and Paxinos 42 mouse brain atlas were considered for further analysis . Microdialysis samples were analysed by high pressure liquid chromato - graphy with electrochemical detection . The column was an ET 125 / 2 , Nucleosil 120 - 5 , C - 18 reversed phase column ( Macherey – Nagel , Düren , Germany ) perfused with a mobile phase composed of 75 m M NaH 2 PO 4 , 4 m M KCl , 20 μ M ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid , 1 . 5 m M sodium dodecyl sulfate , 100 μ l l − 1 diethylamine , 12 % methanol and 12 % acetonitrile adjusted to pH 6 . 0 using phosphoric acid . The electrochemical detector ( Intro , Antec , Leyden , The Netherlands ) was set at 500 mV vs an in situ Ag / AgCl reference electrode ( Antec ) at 30 °C . This setup allows the simultaneous measurement of DA , serotonin and noradrenaline . The detection limit of the assay was 0 . 1 pg for all neurotransmitters with a signal – noise ratio of 2 : 1 . Neurochemical data were not corrected for recovery . 40 , 41 RNA isolation and quantitative PCR After the alcohol drinking study ( experiment I ) and a parallel study with a cohort of mice that received only water in two bottles at the same time , mice were killed by cervical dislocation and brains were immediately collected and frozen on dry ice . Areas of interest were cut from coronal sections of 1 - mm thickness according to anatomical coordinates taken from the Franklin and Paxinos 42 mouse brain atlas . In a preliminary analysis of EFhd2 expression in the mouse brain , we found the PFC as the area with highest messenger RNA expression ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . Accordingly , total RNA from the PFC was isolated with RNeasy Mini kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) according to the manufacturers ’ instructions . Tissue was mechanically homogenized in the lysis buffer using a TissueLyser LT bead mill and stainless steel beads ( Qiagen ) . Isolated RNA was dissolved in RNAse - free water and stored at − 80 °C . RNA quality and quantity were assessed on a Nanodrop ND - 1000 UV - Vis spectrophotometer ( NanoDrop Technologies , Rockland , DE , USA ) . RNA quality and quantity were assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) and a Nanodrop ND - 1000 UV - Vis spectrophotometer ( NanoDrop Technologies ) . Biotin - labelled complementary RNA was obtained using the two - cycle eukaryotic target labelling assay and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2 . 0 arrays according to the standard protocol ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . GeneChip Operating Software ( Affymetrix ) was used for quality controls of the assays and included scaling factor and percentage of genes present . Raw data from gene expression arrays ( CEL ﬁ les ) were processed in Partek Genomics Suite , version 6 . 5 ( Partek , St Louis , MO , USA ) using GC - RMA algorithm normal - ization , principle components analysis without outliers and analysis of variance yielding P - values and fold change values . For quantitative PCR with reverse transcription , 0 . 5 μ g of RNA was reverse - transcribed into complementary DNA ( cDNA ) using SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit ( Life Technologies , Darmstadt , Germany ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . After completion and termination of the reverse transcription reaction , cDNA was diluted with 90 μ l LowTE and stored at − 20 °C . Quantitative real - time PCR was conducted on a LightCycler 480 real - time PCR system ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) using SYBR - green chemistry . Each quantitative PCR reaction contained 5 μ l FastStart Essential DNA Green Master ( Roche ) , 1 μ M of each of two gene - speci ﬁ c primers and 2 . 5 μ l diluted cDNA ( corresponding to 12 . 5 ng RNA ) in a total volume of 10 μ l . Temperature pro ﬁ le used was : 95 °C for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of ampli ﬁ cation ( 95 °C for 10 s , 60 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 30 s ) and by melting curve analysis . After run , PCR product speci ﬁ city was assessed by the inspection of single peak melting curves . Threshold cycles ( Ct ) were determined with the second derivative maximum method using the LightCycler 480 software ( release 1 . 5 . 0 ) , and relative messenger RNA expression levels were calculated in Microsoft Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA , USA ) using the 2 − ΔΔ Ct method . 43 Gene - speci ﬁ c PCR primers for differentially expressed candidate genes were retrieved from PrimerBank ( https : / / pga . mgh . harvard . edu / primerbank ) . Gusb and Hprt were used as reference genes . Primer sequences can be found in Supplementary Table 7 . Mouse gene expression microarray analysis We extracted the raw probe - level data from Affymetrix Mouse 430 version 2 . 0 CEL ﬁ les and used the robust multi - array average algorithm for background correction , normalization and summarization of expression at probeset levels . 44 Probesets that are ‘ absent ’ ( present / absent call using MAS5 ) in all samples were ﬁ ltered out from the analysis . We mapped each probeset to Entrez GeneID using Bioconductor annotation package . 45 We selected the probeset with the highest mean expression value in a particular data set when multiple probesets were mapped to the same GeneID . Gene co - expression network analysis and module characterization Network analysis was performed with weighted gene co - expression network analysis as previously described . 46 Brie ﬂ y , we created a correlation matrix containing all pair - wise Pearson correlations between all genes across all samples . We then transformed the correlation matrix into a signed adjacency matrix using a power function with parameter β . The components of this matrix ( connection strengths ) were then used to calculate ‘ topological overlap ’ , a robust and biologically meaningful measurement of gene similarity based on two genes ’ co - expression relationships with all other genes in the network . Finally , modules of highly correlated genes were determined using average linkage hierarchical clustering followed dynamic tree - cut algorithm . For this data set , we selected 5000 high variable genes and used the smallest β ( = 12 ) that leads to an approximately scale - free network with the truncated scale - free ﬁ tting index R 2 4 0 . 9 . Once modules were identi ﬁ ed , each module was represented by the module eigengene ( ME ) , de ﬁ ned as the ﬁ rst principal component of a module , and is the component that explains the maximum possible variability for all genes in a module . The ME is commonly used as a representative value for a module . We calculated Pearson correlations between each gene and each ME — referred to as a gene ’ s module membership — along with the corresponding P - values . Modules were characterized in two ways . First , ME of each module was tested for its association with phenotypic traits ( genotype : EFhd2 KO vs WT , treatment : alcohol vs saline and genotype×treatment interaction ) . Second , modules were annotated with known gene ontologies ( GOs ) to understand the biological signi ﬁ cance of the module . To annotate each module , we used GO functional enrichment analysis implementation from the weighted gene co - expression network package . Genetic association in a human sample Data from 1980 adolescent participants ( 960 males ) were available for analyses . The mean age of participants was 14 . 4 years old ( s . d . = 0 . 41 ) . The participants were community recruited from eight sites in France , Germany , Ireland and the United Kingdom as part of the IMAGEN study . Approval was obtained from all local research ethics committees . Written consent was obtained from both the participant and their parent / guardian . A detailed account of recruitment and assessment methods has been previously described . 47 Alcohol consumption behaviour was measured using the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs . 48 Speci ﬁ cally , we explored lifetime drinking frequency and lifetime binge drinking frequency ( de ﬁ ned as consumption of ﬁ ve or more drinks in a row ) . Anxiety sensitivity was measured using the mean response from the ﬁ ve anxiety sensitivity items of the Substance Use Risk Pro ﬁ le Scale , 49 with a higher mean score indicating greater anxiety sensitivity . Genotyping . DNA puri ﬁ cation and genotyping were performed by the Centre National de Génotypage in Paris . DNA was extracted from whole blood samples ( ~ 10 ml ) preserved in BD Vacutainer ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid tubes ( Becton , Dickinson and Company , Oxford , UK ) using Gentra Puregene Blood kit ( QIAGEN , Valencia , CA , USA ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Genotype information was collected at 582 982 markers using the Illumina HumanHap610 Genotyping BeadChip ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) as part of a previous genome - wide association study . 47 Single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) with call rates of o 98 % , minor allele frequency o 1 % or deviation from the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium Genetic base for sensation - seeking and alcohol addiction D Mielenz et al 4 Molecular Psychiatry ( 2017 ) , 1 – 17 ( P o 1 . 00×10 − 4 ) were excluded from the analyses . Individuals with an ambiguous sex code , excessive missing genotypes ( failure rate 4 2 % ) and outlying heterozygosity ( heterozygosity rate of 3 s . d . ’ s from the mean ) were also excluded . Identity - by - state similarity was used to estimate cryptic relatedness for each pair of individuals using PLINK software . 50 Closely related individuals with identity by descent ( 4 0 . 1875 ) were eliminated from the subsequent analysis . Population strati ﬁ cation for the genome - wide association study data was examined by principal compo - nent analysis using EIGENSTRAT software . 51 The four HapMap populations were used as reference groups in the principal component analysis and individuals with divergent ancestry ( from CEU ) were also excluded . The imputation protocols used MaCH 52 for haplotype phasing and minimac 53 for imputation . Imputed dosage values were kept in the analysis if the quality of the imputation was high ( R 2 4 0 . 5 ) . Imputed common SNPs with minor allele frequency 4 0 . 01 within 5000 base pairs up - and downstream of EFHD2 gene were included in the following analysis . Partial correlation analyses were conducted to investigate gene - wide associations between EFHD2 common SNPs and phenotypes . Permutation test were used to control for multiple testing where it is necessary . Similarities between genetic contributions for different phenotypes The genetic contributions of a particular phenotype were calculated as the regression coef ﬁ cients , that is , commonly known as the beta value , of univariate analyses between the given phenotype and all given SNPs , that is , 105 common SNPs of EFHD2 in this study . The similarity statistic between two phenotypes was then calculated as the correlation between the corresponding groups of beta values . Because the SNP information was identical in estimating both genetic contributions , the null distribution of this correlation , that is , the similarity , can only be established through a permutation analysis , that is , re - calculating the similarity statistics with SNP data having its individuals randomly permuted . A two - tailed P - value can then be assessed as the number of permutation iterations with a correlation having its absolute value larger than the absolute value of the observed similarity statistic . To measure the similarities between genetic contributions shares the same idea of commonly used polygenetic analysis . However , instead of predicting one phenotype from the other ’ s genetic contribution , we compare the similarity between both of their genetic contributions . Human magnetic resonance imaging Full details of the magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) acquisition protocols and quality checks have been described previously . 47 Brain images were segmented with the FreeSurfer software package ( http : / / surfer . nmr . mgh . harvard . edu / ) and the entire cortex of each individual was inspected for inaccuracies . Individuals with major malformations of the cerebral cortex were excluded from further analysis . Out of 1909 images , we focused on 1136 individuals passed a stringent quality control . The mean of left and right thickness of superior frontal gyrus ( SFG ) was included in the following analysis as it was found to be related to drinking behaviour . The effect of MRI site was controlled by adding it as a nuisance covariate in all statistical analyses . Mouse MRI A total of n = 16 naive EFhd2 KO and WT mice , 8 – 16 weeks old , age and sex - matched , were examined ex vivo in a dedicated small animal MRI scanner at 4 . 7 T ( Biospec 47 / 40 , Bruker , Ettlingen , Germany ) using a standard mouse brain coil of the manufacturer ( Bruker ) . For each animal , T1 - weighted images ( voxel size 0 . 086×0 . 086×0 . 160 mm 3 ) of the brain were acquired to determine the volume of hippocampus , ventricles , PFC , sensumotor cortex and olfactory bulb of each brain by Aycan Osirix Pro ( aycan Digitalsysteme , Würzburg , Germany ) in combination with a segmentation plugin ( Version 1 . 0 , Chimaera , Erlangen , Germany ) . Xenopus laevis embryos and in situ hybridizations Xenopus embryos were generated and cultured according to general protocols and staged according to the normal table of Nieuwkoop and Faber . 54 All procedures were performed according to the German animal use and care law ( Tierschutzgesetz ) and approved by the local authorities and committees ( animal care and housing approval : I / 39 / EE006 , Veter - inäramt Erlangen ; German state administration Bavaria / Regierung von Mittelfranken ) . At eight - cell stage Xenopus embryos were injected unilaterally into one dorso - animal blastomere with 0 . 4 pmol of EFhd2 morpholino ( 5 ′ - GCTCGTCGTCTGAAGCCATAGAGGT - 3 ′ ) or an unrelated control morpholino . To trace the injected side , 200 pg of pCS2 - β - galactosidase DNA was co - injected . At stage 28 , the embryos were ﬁ xed and β - galactosidase staining was carried out to identify the injected side . The indicated genes were detected by whole - mount in situ hybridizations as described by Harland . 55 To analyse the expression of efhd2 in Xenopus brains of stage 40 tadpoles , ﬁ xed specimen were dissected and in situ hybridization was carried out as above . Cell morphology Newborn mice were killed and primary cortical neurons ( CNs ) were isolated and cultured as previously described . 23 pSuper vectors containing EFhd2 short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) and scrambled shRNA as well as the EFhd2 - GFP vector have been described before . 56 , 57 The scrambled shRNA and the shRNA directed against EFhd2 were subcloned into pSuper - NeoGFP ( 50 ) via Hin dIII and Eco RI restriction sites . After 7 days in culture , CNs were transfected with mRFP - ßActin together with shScramble , shEFhd2 or EFhd2 - GFP using Lipofectamin 2000 ( Invitrogen , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , Pinneberg , Germany ) and 48 h later ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature . Transfected CNs were analysed with a Zeiss Apotome 2 microscope ( Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) . Data were quanti ﬁ ed using NeuronJ ( ImageJ , National Institute of Mental Health , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . Statistics All quantitative data were expressed as mean±s . e . m . Data were analysed using analysis of variances ( for repeated measures where appropriate ) and by pre - planned comparisons using Fisher ’ s least signi ﬁ cant difference tests with Bonferroni correction when appropriate . 58 For single - group compar - isons of normally distributed data , t - tests were used . Although sex differences are well known in alcoholism - related behaviours , 59 a routine screen in each experiment did not indicate sex differences in this study . Therefore , data were collapsed for analysis . The software SPSS 17 . 0 ( IBM , Armonk , NY , USA ) , PLINK v1 . 07 ( Cambridge , MA , USA ) and Statistica 9 ( Statsoft , Tulsa , OK , USA ) were used . A signi ﬁ cance level of P o 0 . 05 was used . RESULTS EFhd2 is required for alcohol drinking and escalation of consumption To determine the role of EFhd2 in spontaneous alcohol consumption , we measured alcohol drinking in a two - bottle free - choice paradigm in EFhd2 KO and WT mice . We found that EFhd2 KO mice drink signi ﬁ cantly more alcohol ( genotype : F 1 , 95 = 21 . 87 , P o 0 . 0001 ; Figure 1a ) and prefer it more to water than WT mice ( genotype : F 1 , 95 = 4 . 44 , P o 0 . 038 ; Figure 1b ) . After initial drinking establishment , animals were left undisturbed in cages with 16 vol . % alcohol solution freely available . Daily measurement of consumption showed that alcohol intake escalated spontaneously in EFhd2 KO mice . This increase became statistically signi ﬁ cant after 10 days of drinking ( genotype : F 1 , 19 = 25 . 75 , P o 0 . 0001 ; day : F 22 , 418 = 2 . 82 , P o 0 . 0001 ; Figure 1c ) , whereas WT mice showed constant consumption . As there was no external event to which the escalation of consumption and preference can be attributed , it is suggested that EFhd2 provides resilience to accumulating alcohol effects in the brain that sensitize for the reinforcing effects . When animals were withdrawn from alcohol drinking and then reinstated , they showed an alcohol deprivation effect , which becomes evident by a short increase in consumption over several days . This resembles the human situation in alcohol - dependent patients . We tested alcohol consumption after two withdrawal periods of 3 weeks each . Results showed an increase in alcohol consumption in the WT mice after ﬁ rst ( P = 0 . 0108 ) and second withdrawal ( P o 0 . 0001 ) , most evident in the area under the curve ( Figure 1d ) . In the already escalated EFhd2 KO mice , no alcohol deprivation effect was observed , but consumption remained elevated compared to WT mice ( P ⩽ 0 . 0001 ; Figures 1c and d ) . This was con ﬁ rmed Genetic base for sensation - seeking and alcohol addiction D Mielenz et al 5 Molecular Psychiatry ( 2017 ) , 1 – 17 by a spontaneous escalation of alcohol preference vs water in the EFhd2 KO mice ( genotype : F 1 , 19 = 23 . 68 , P o 0 . 0001 ; day : F 22 , 418 = 2 . 55 , P o 0 . 0002 ; Figure 1e ) . It should be noted that the preference of 16 vol . % alcohol over water was initially o 50 % , but reached values of 4 50 % during escalation in EFhd2 KO mice . This may suggest that an initial aversive component was overcome by chronic alcohol exposure , a process that was accelerated in animals lacking EFhd2 . We further tested whether the lack of EFhd2 would lead to altered taste sensitivity in a taste preference test .

Genetic base for sensation - seeking and alcohol addiction D Mielenz et al 6 Molecular Psychiatry ( 2017 ) , 1 – 17 the preference for sweet tasting sucrose nor the avoidance of bitter tasting quinine solution was altered in EFhd2 KO mice compared to WT mice ( P 4 0 . 05 ; Figure 1f ) . Although EFhd2 KO mice consumed signi ﬁ cantly more alcohol over time , weight gain was comparable with WT mice ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) , suggesting that there was no overall increase in calorie intake in the EFhd2 KO mice compared to WT during alcohol drinking . This was supported by metabolic cage measurements without alcohol available , showing normal food and water consumption in EFhd2 KO mice ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . Altogether , these data show that EFhd2 is a negative regulator for alcohol preference and the control of alcohol consumption upon chronic exposure . EFhd2 controls the sedating effects of alcohol A high tolerance against the sedating effects of alcohol is a risk factor for the establishment of alcohol addiction in humans .

EFhd2 knockout ( KO ) mice display a sensation - seeking / low - anxiety behavioural phenotype that is frequently associated with an enhanced risk for alcohol addiction . ( a ) In the open - ﬁ eld ( OF ) test EFhd2 KO mice ( n = 9 ) show higher locomotor activity in a novel environment than wild - type ( WT ) mice ( n = 12 ) . ( b ) The latency to enter the anxiogenic centre of the maze for the ﬁ rst time is reduced and ( c ) EFhd2 KO mice spend more time in the centre of the maze than WT mice . ( d ) Centre locomotion of EFhd2 KO mice is enhanced in the OF . ( e ) Locomotion in the periphery of the maze is not altered in EFhd2 KO mice . Also the elevated plus maze ( EPM ) test suggests reduced levels of anxiety in EFhd2 KO ( n = 8 ) compared to WT ( n = 12 ) mice . ( f ) The number of entries into the open arms is enhanced in EFhd2 KO mice . ( g ) Also , locomotion in the open arms is enhanced . In - depth analysis of anxiety - related behaviour in the EPM shows that major differences between EFhd2 KO and WT mice are derived from behaviour in most anxiety - loaded parts of the maze , that is , the distal part of the arms , as shown by ( h ) the time spent on proximal ( Prox ) and distal ( Dist ) arms of the maze , ( i ) the locomotor activity on all arms of the EPM , and by ( j ) the entries in the arms of the EPM . ( k ) In the forced swim test , EFhd2 KO mice show less immobility ( ﬂ oating ) than WT mice . ( l ) The novelty - suppressed feeding ( NSF ) test shows a strong tendency for reduced depression - like behaviour in EFhd2 KO mice ( n = 8 ) compared to WT ( n = 11 ) mice . The latency to eat food in a novel environment is largely reduced in EFhd2 KO mice . ( m ) Speed of locomotion to search out for the food in the NSF test is signi ﬁ cantly enhanced in EFhd2 KO mice , indicating a reduced suppression of feeding by the novelty of the environment . ( n ) The lack of EFhd2 has no effect on sucrose preference ( * P o 0 . 05 ; * * P o 0 . 01 ) . Genetic base for sensation - seeking and alcohol addiction D Mielenz et al 7 Molecular Psychiatry ( 2017 ) , 1 – 17 However , neuronal mechanisms of alcohol drinking and sedation frequently dissociate . 33 Therefore , we tested the sedating effect of alcohol in EFhd2 KO mice using the LORR test . The lack of EFhd2 had no effect on the latency of sedation after a high - dose alcohol injection ( P 4 0 . 05 ; Figure 1g ) , but signi ﬁ cantly reduced the duration of the sedating effects ( t = − 2 . 2637 , P = 0 . 0291 ; Figure 1h ) . To rule out that altered bioavailability is a potential reason for the observed behavioural effects , we measured blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) after a challenge dose in a new population of animals . Results showed that the lack of EFhd2 had no signi ﬁ cant effect on alcohol BAC levels up to 2 h after administration ( P 4 0 . 05 ; Figure 1i ) . Also after a high - dose alcohol ( 3 . 5 g kg − 1 , i . p . ) , as it was used for LORR , there was no difference in BAC between EFhd2 KO and WT mice at the time of LORR effects ( P 4 0 . 05 ; Supplementary Figure 5 ) . Altogether , these results suggest that EFhd2 enhances the sedating effects of alcohol , which may explain , in turn , the limiting effects on consumption . EFhd2 de ﬁ ciency leads to behavioural traits that are known addiction risk factors In humans and animal models , particular personality traits are associated with an enhanced risk for the initiation of drug - seeking and consumption . These include enhanced sensation - seeking and low levels of trait anxiety . 60 – 63 Here we asked whether lack of EFhd2 function would result in a behavioural phenotype predictive for enhanced risk of alcohol addiction . A new group of animals was tested in the open - ﬁ eld test for novelty / sensation - seeking and anxiety - related behaviour . 29 , 64 EFhd2 KO mice showed signi ﬁ cantly more total exploratory locomotion when exposed to a novel environment ( P = 0 . 0067 and P = 0 . 0499 ; Figure 2a ) . There was a shorter latency to enter the centre ( t = − 2 . 6235 , P = 0 . 0167 ) , and EFhd2 KO mice spent signi ﬁ cantly more time in the centre of a novel arena ( P = 0 . 0364 ) and showed more locomotion there ( P = 0 . 0264 ) than WT mice ( Figures 2b – e ) . This trait was mainly limited to the ﬁ rst 5 – 10 min of exploration , suggesting that EFhd2 plays no role in novelty processing once stimulus habituation took place . EFhd2 KO mice were not more active than WT mice in the periphery of the maze ( P 4 0 . 05 ; Figure 2e ) . These data suggest a novelty / sensation - seeking and low - anxiety trait in animals lacking EFhd2 . In the EPM test of anxiety , EFhd2 KO mice showed signi ﬁ cantly more entries to the open arms ( t = 2 . 7988 , P = 0 . 0118 ) and more locomotion on these arms ( t = 2 . 6553 , P = 0 . 0161 ) compared to WT mice ( Figures 2f and g ) . They also spent signi ﬁ cantly more time on the most anxiety - associated distal part of the open arms ( t = 2 . 1605 , P = 0 . 0444 ; Figure 2h ) . They showed more locomotion in this part of the maze ( t = 2 . 3823 , P = 0 . 0284 ; Figure 2i ) , whereas entries to the distal closed arms were reduced ( t = − 2 . 1421 , P = 0 . 0461 ; Figure 2j ) . Altogether , the EPM test suggests reduced trait anxiety in EFhd2 KO mice . To further exclude a depression - like behaviour , we performed the forced swim test , which showed signi ﬁ cantly reduced levels of ﬂ oating in the EFhd2 KO mice ( t = − 3 . 1236 , P = 0 . 0053 ; Figure 2k ) . In the novelty - suppressed feeding test of depression / anxiety - associated behaviour , a similar trend became obvious ( Figure 2l ) . Interestingly , the speed of movement towards the food source was signi ﬁ cantly enhanced in EFhd2 KO mice ( t = 3 . 8908 , P = 0 . 0011 ) , supporting an enhanced activity in a novel environ - ment ( Figure 2m ) . We also measured the hedonic tone in EFhd2 KO mice using the sucrose preference test , where animals can chose in their consumption between a 2 % sucrose solution and water . In this test , however , EFhd2 KO mice did not differ from WT mice ( P 4 0 . 05 ; Figure 2n ) . Altogether , these ﬁ ndings suggest enhanced sensation - seeking and reduced anxiety - like behaviour in animals lacking EFhd2 in an aversive situation , but preserved hedonic processing in non - aversive situations . Overall , the behavioural characterization of EFhd2 KO mice suggests a sensation - seeking / low - anxiety phenotype that is predictive for future alcohol misuse in adolescents 62 and associated with alcohol drinking and abuse in adults . 61 , 63 , 65 Pharmacological reversal of low - anxiety state eliminates enhanced alcohol preference in EFhd2 KO mice It has been suggested that personality traits such as sensation - seeking / low anxiety predispose individuals for an enhanced risk of alcohol misuse . We , therefore , asked whether a reversal of this trait would also reduce spontaneous alcohol consumption in EFhd2 KO mice . We treated a new group of animals sub - chronically for 35 days with either the anxiogenic compound β - CCE ( 1 . 5 mg kg per day ) or with vehicle using osmotic minipumps ( s . c . ) . 36 After 10 days of treatment , emotional behaviour and subsequently alcohol drinking was tested in a two - bottle free - choice drinking test . We found that β - CCE reversed low - anxiety levels of EFhd2 KO mice to the levels of WT animals in an EPM test ( Figure 3a ) . Open arm ( P = 0 . 0477 ) and centre time ( P = 0 . 0453 ) were enhanced in EFhd2 KO mice vs WT when receiving vehicle treatment , but no longer , when β - CCE was administered ( P 4 0 . 05 ) . Corres - pondingly , closed arm time was reduced in EFhd2 KO mice ( P = 0 . 026 ) when receiving vehicle treatment , but no longer , when β - CCE was administered ( P 4 0 . 05 ) . Also locomotor activity on open arms was enhanced in EFhd2 KO mice as an indicator of sensation - seeking , which was reversed by β - CCE ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . Subsequently , EFhd2 KO mice showed enhanced alcohol consumption ( genotype : F 1 , 140 = 17 . 081 , P o 0 . 0001 ; dose : F 4 , 140 = 253 . 568 , P o 0 . 0001 ; interaction : F 1 , 140 = 9 . 530 , P = 0 . 0024 ) , in particular , at doses of 12 vol . % ( P = 0 . 0018 ) and 16 vol . % alcohol ( P = 0 . 0002 ; Figure 3b ) . Alcohol consumption was normal - ized by β - CCE treatment in EFhd2 KO mice to the level of WT animals ( P = 0 . 0147 vs EFhd2 KO vehicle ) . In WT mice , the dose of β - CCE used here had neither an effect on emotional behaviour nor on alcohol consumption ( P 4 0 . 05 ; Figures 3a and b ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that EFhd2 de ﬁ ciency is associated with a high - risk personality trait that leads to increased alcohol drinking . EFhd2 has no role in the conditioned reinforcing effects of alcohol Drug addiction is a behavioural syndrome that is shaped by distinct learned behaviours . 3 , 66 One of them is the predominantly classically conditioned preference for places associated with alcohol action , as measured by CPP . 67 Given that EFhd2 is not uniformly expressed in the brain , a distinct involvement in different types of drug memories and addiction - related beha - viours appeared very likely . Here we asked whether EFhd2 would also provide resilience to the establishment of conditioned reinforcing effects of alcohol . Using a two - compartment CPP box with seven conditioning and pseudo - conditioning trials and three tests to monitor the build - up of an alcohol CPP , 38 we found that alcohol i . p . injections induce a signi ﬁ cant preference over time for the compartment paired with the drug ( time : F 3 , 90 = 3 . 112 , P = 0 . 030 ; genotype : F 1 , 30 = 0 . 228 , P = 0 . 637 ; interaction : F 3 , 90 = 0 . 272 , P = 0 . 845 ) . Entries into this compartment decreased signi ﬁ cantly , suggesting an enhanced sojourn time after each visit . However , there was no signi ﬁ cant difference in the time spent or entries to the conditioning compartment between EFhd2 KO and WT mice ( P 4 0 . 05 ; Supplementary Figure 7 ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that EFhd2 does not provide resilience action to the establishment of the conditioned reinforcing effects of alcohol . EFhd2 controls the mesolimbic , but not the mesocortical DA response There are several motives for alcohol consumption in humans , 3 and distinct ways of how drinking may escalate from them . 4 A crucial mechanism is related to the pharmacological reinforcing effects of the alcohol , which is mediated by an activation of the Genetic base for sensation - seeking and alcohol addiction D Mielenz et al 8 Molecular Psychiatry ( 2017 ) , 1 – 17 mesocorticolimbic DA systems . 68 To characterize how EFhd2 provides resilience against alcohol drinking escalation , we mea - sured alcohol - induced DA responses in target regions of the mesolimbic and mesocortical DA systems using in vivo micro - dialysis in freely moving animals . 31 , 32 We found that basal DA levels were signi ﬁ cantly attenuated in the Nac ( P o 0 . 0393 ) , but not in the PFC ( P 4 0 . 05 ) of EFhd2 KO mice ( Figure 3c ) . In the Nac , extracellular DA levels were signi ﬁ cantly higher after a 2 g kg − 1 ( i . p . ) alcohol injection in EFhd2 KO mice than in WT starting 20 min after injection and persisting for up to 140 min ( genotype : F 1 , 16 = 8 . 344 , P o 0 . 0107 ; Figure 3d ) . No difference in the DA increase after alcohol injection was observed in the PFC ( P 4 0 . 05 ; Figure 3e ) . EFhd2 has an inhibitory effect on basal noradrenergic activity in the Nac as well as in the PFC , but has no role in serotonergic tone in these brain regions ( Supplementary Figure 8 ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that EFhd2 might exert its resilience effects by enhancing basal DA levels and restricting alcohol - induced DA responses speci ﬁ cally in the mesolimbic , but not the mesocortical DA system .

Low anxiety and high alcohol consumption in EFhd2 knockout ( KO ) mice can be reversed by chronic subcutaneous ( s . c . ) treatment with the anxiogenic drug β - carboline - 3 - carboxylate ethyl ester ( β - CCE ) . β - CCE was administered s . c . by osmotic minipumps at a rate of 1 . 5 mg kg − 1 per day . After 8 – 9 days of administration , the elevated plus maze ( EPM ) test revealed a reversal of the low - anxiety phenotype of EFhd2 KO mice ( n = 7 per group ) to the level of wild - type ( WT , n = 8 and 9 per group ) animals .

Genetic base for sensation - seeking and alcohol addiction D Mielenz et al 9 Molecular Psychiatry ( 2017 ) , 1 – 17 EFhd2 regulates gene expression after alcohol exposition To investigate the molecular basis for the EFhd2 - related differ - ences in the alcohol response , we extracted RNA from PFC of mice which had been drinking alcohol or water for 3 months and performed genome - wide transcriptional analysis . The PFC was chosen as a brain area exerting important top - down cortical control on alcohol drinking . 59 Using two - way analysis of variance ( genotype×treatment ) , we identi ﬁ ed 853 differentially expressed genes ( P o 0 . 05 ) for genotype , 1276 for treatment and 700 for the interaction . We next applied weighted gene co - expression network analysis to identify groups of genes ( modules ) with similar expression and identi ﬁ ed 16 modules containing each 103 – 618 genes ( labelled with arbitrary colour ; Figure 4 and Table 1 ) . Of these 16 modules , 2 were signi ﬁ cantly associated with genotype ( turquoise and green yellow ) and four with treatment ( pink , purple , tan and yellow ) , considering a false discovery rate of 0 . 05 ( Table 1 ; Supplementary Figures 9 and 10 ) . None of the modules satis ﬁ ed this criterion for interaction . All genes in the turquoise module were downregulated in EFhd2 KO mice in comparison to WT , whereas the genes in the green - yellow module were upregulated ( Figures 4e and f ) . To explore the biological relevance of the modules , we determined enrichment of GO terms . GO terms enriched in the turquoise module ( 618 genes ) included developmental process , cell surface receptor signalling pathway , DA biosynthetic process and fore - brain neuronal differentiation ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . We further performed pathway analysis and identi ﬁ ed genes in the turquoise module involved in axon guidance , chemokine signalling , glutamatergic synapse , focal adhesion , ECM receptor interaction and long - term potentiation ( Table 2 ) . Importantly , the turquoise module includes EFhd2 itself , strongly suggesting that the genes assigned to this module may have important biological relation - ships with EFhd2 . The top differentially expressed genes in this module included S100a5 ( log 2 fold change , FC = − 2 . 02 , P = 3 . 24×10 − 06 ) , which is known to bind Ca 2 + , 69 Doc2g ( log 2 FC = − 1 . 71 , P = 1 . 22×10 − 05 ) , which is likely involved in vesicular traf ﬁ cking , 70 Th ( log 2 FC = − 1 . 31 , P = 1 . 14×10 − 05 ) , which has been implicated in DA synthesis and alcoholism , 71 and Eomes ( log 2 FC = − 1 . 01 , P = 2 . 27×10 − 04 ) , which has been shown to be important for cortex development downstream of Pax6 . 72 , 73 Of note , Pax6 was also downregulated in EFhd2 KO ( log 2 FC = − 0 . 247 , P = 0 . 018 ) . The top differentially expressed genes of the turquoise module were all corroborated by quantitative PCR ( Supplementary Figure 10 ) . The green - yellow module consisted of 172 genes that were enriched for metal ion transport ( P = 6 . 36×10 − 05 ) , chemical homeostasis ( P = 8 . 56×10 − 05 ) , positive regulation of fatty acid transport ( P = 9 . 81×10 − 05 ) , channel activity ( P = 2 . 40×10 − 04 ) and calcium ion homeostasis ( P = 7 . 48×10 − 04 ; Supplementary Table 2 ) . Genes represented in the green - yellow module are involved in MAPK signalling , focal adhesion and mTOR signalling ( Table 2 ) . The alcohol - responsive modules also showed signi ﬁ cant correlations between module membership and gene signi ﬁ cance to the treatment effect ( Supplementary Figure 9 ) . A majority of genes in the yellow module were upregulated by alcohol compared to water consumption , whereas all the genes in the three modules , tan , pink and purple , were downregulated ( Supplementary Figure 10 ) . GO term enrichment in the yellow module ( 537 genes ) included cellular carbohydrate metabolic process , response to chemical stimuli , dendritic spine growth and acute in ﬂ ammatory response ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Pathway analysis revealed that genes included in the yellow module and upregulated in response to alcohol consumption are involved in chemokine , PPAR , calcium , JAK / STAT and phosphatidylinositol signalling as well as in long - term potentiation and glutamatergic synapses ( Table 3 ) . GO term enrichment included DA transport and regulation of neuronal apoptotic processes in the tan module ( 170 genes ) ( Supplementary Table 4 ) , regulation of the MAPK cascade , integrin activation and regulation of cell cycle in the pink module ( 295 genes ; Supplementary Table 5 ) , and regulation of phosphoprotein phosphatase activity , magnesium ion binding and regulation of mesenchymal cell proliferation in the purple module ( 192 genes ) ( Supplementary Table 6 ) . Genes included in these modules and downregulated by alcohol consumption were found to be involved in the MAPK signalling pathway , tight junction , cell cycle and axon guidance ( Table 3 ) . EFhd2 - controlled gene expression is associated with cortical maturation in mice and Xenopus Two GO terms enriched in the EFhd2 - controlled turquoise module were developmental processes and forebrain neuronal differentia - tion . Strikingly , EFhd2 controlled the expression of genes associated with cortical maturation , Eomes / Tbr2 and Pax6 . 72 , 73 Pax6 elicits normal development of cortical basal progenitor cells via Eomes expression 74 , 75 and cortical connections are shaped via the Pax6 – Eomes – Tbr1 axis . 76 Pax6 mutations have been linked to progressive decline in thickness of the fronto - parietal cortex and cortex - dependent working memory with age in humans . 74 A speci ﬁ c role of EFhd2 in the human cortex was previously suggested by Borger et al . 22 and the Efhd2 gene is evolutionary conserved from Drosophila to Xenopus to humans . 16 We wished to translate our ﬁ ndings into the human situation . To test ﬁ rst for a principal evolutionary conservation of the EFhd2 pathway and to con ﬁ rm our gene expression data in a completely independent system , we analysed the effect of morpholino - mediated EFhd2 downregulation in Xenopus tadpoles as an established model system . This would also provide an independent con ﬁ rmation of our results obtained in mice . The expression of Efhd2 was detected ubiquitously in the brain of Xenopus laevis stage 40 tadpoles . 77 In accordance with the expression of Efhd2 in murine and human cortex , 22 , 23 we detected Efhd2 messenger RNA also in the cortex of developing Xenopus tadpoles ( Figure 5a ) . Enhanced Efhd2 expression was also detected in the metencephalon , the ventral telencephalon and ventral diencephalon as well as in the pituitary primordia and at rhombomere borders in the hindbrain ( Figure 5a ) . Pax6 , is strongly expressed in the telencephalon and the eyes of early tadpoles . 72 , 78 Unilateral antisense morpholino oligonucleotide ( Mo ) - mediated knockdown of EFhd2 resulted in a strong reduction of Pax6 in the telencephalon , but not in the eye . A control morpholino did not affect Pax6 expression ( Figure 5b ) . Importantly , knockdown of EFhd2 by morpholinos reduced Pax6 expression in the forebrain , but not in the eye in over 90 % of the EFhd2 morpholino - injected embryos ( n = 60 ) . In contrast , only 10 % of the control morpholino - injected embryos show a reduction of Pax6 on the injected side ( n = 60 ) . At stage 28 , Eomes is only expressed in the forebrain ( Supplementary Figure 12 ) , marked also by Pax6 here , and in accordance , knockdown of EFhd2 reduced Eomes expression ( Figure 5c ) . Hence , regulation of Pax6 / Eomes expression by EFhd2 is evolutionary conserved between mouse and Xenopus . On the basis of these ﬁ ndings , we hypothesized that EFhd2 might be involved in cortical development . To test for a role of EFhd2 in cortical development , we investigated the morphological size of the PFC , the sensorimotor cortex , the hippocampus , the olfactory bulb and the ventricle size in EFhd2 KO mice using MRI ( Supplementary Figure 13 ) . We observed that the volumes of the PFC ( t = − 2 . 5171 , P = 0 . 0246 ) and sensorimotor cortex ( t = − 2 . 3911 , P = 0 . 031 ) , but not those of hippocampus , olfactory bulb or ventricles ( P 4 0 . 05 ) were signi ﬁ cantly reduced in EFhd2 KO mice ( Figure 5d ) . These data may provide a developmental mechanism for the high alcohol preference in Efhd2 KO mice since reduced cortical maturation is associated with early onset of alcohol consumption in humans . 79 EFhd2 controls neuronal morphology Drug and alcohol exposition induces morphological plasticity at the level of neuronal spines and dendrites , which is supposed to Genetic base for sensation - seeking and alcohol addiction D Mielenz et al 10 Molecular Psychiatry ( 2017 ) , 1 – 17 underlie the learning of drug - seeking and consumption behaviour . 80 , 81 Recent data suggested that EFhd2 might be involved in dendritic plasticity by regulating actin dynamics . 21 Therefore , we used overexpression and shRNA - mediated knock - down of EFhd2 in murine primary CNs to investigate number and length of dendrites . We found that downregulation of EFhd2 led Figure 4 . EFhd2 controls gene co - expression in the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) of mice , a brain region with naturally high EFhd2 expression .

Genetic base for sensation - seeking and alcohol addiction D Mielenz et al 11 Molecular Psychiatry ( 2017 ) , 1 – 17 to an increased number of secondary and tertiary dendrites ( spines ; Figures 6a and b ) . However , dendritic length was not altered ( Figures 6c – e ) . Overexpression of EFhd2 increased the number of tertiary dendrites and the length of secondary dendrites and spines ( Figure 6 ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that EFhd2 works at the micro - morphological level by controlling the number of neuronal dendrites . EFhd2 provides a link between trait anxiety and alcohol consumption in an adolescent human population To translate our ﬁ ndings from animal models to humans , we investigated the link between naturally occurring genetic variations in the EFhd2 - coding gene , as SNPs , with alcohol consumption behaviour from European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs 48 ( N = 1773 ) and anxiety traits from the Substance Use Risk Pro ﬁ le Scale 49 ( N = 1810 ) in adolescents of the IMAGEN sample . In the IMAGEN sample , there are 105 imputed SNPs with minor allele frequency 4 0 . 01 within the region ( ±5000 base pairs ) of EFhd2 . Of all these 105 SNPs , the minor C allele of rs112146896 ( minor allele frequency = 2 % ) shows a positive signi ﬁ cant association with the lifetime drinking frequency ( r = 0 . 099 , P = 3 . 04 ×10 − 5 , P corrected = 2 . 08 ×10 − 3 based on 100 . 000 permutations , df = 1763 ; Supplementary Figures 14 and 15A ; Supplementary Table 8 ) and a nominal signi ﬁ cant association with lifetime 5 - binge drinking ( r = 0 . 055 , P = 2 . 10 ×10 − 2 , df = 1763 ; Supplementary Figure 15B ) . Interestingly , an association in oppo - site direction was found for the minor C allele of SNP rs112146896 with anxiety sensitivity ( r = − 0 . 067 , P = 4 . 16 ×10 − 3 , df = 1800 , Supplementary Figure 15C ) . In line with animal observations , these ﬁ ndings suggest that naturally occurring genetic variations in the EFhd2 - coding gene may render human individuals both less anxiety sensitive and more prone to alcohol consumption . To investigate whether the role of EFhd2 in cortical develop - ment and adult cortex size translates into the human condition , we analysed cortex MRI data from adolescents of the IMAGEN sample . Similar to the previous ﬁ ndings , 82 the thickness of SFG was found to be negatively associated with alcohol consumption in humans . We observed a negative association between life - time 5 - binge drinking and the thickness of SFG ( r = − 0 . 067 , P one - tailed = 1 . 34× 10 − 2 , P corrected = 2 . 40 ×10 − 2 based on 100 . 000 permutations ; df = 1083 ; Supplementary Figure 16A ) and a trend for lifetime drinking frequency ( r = − 0 . 042 , P one - tailed = 8 . 22 ×10 − 2 ; df = 1083 ; Supplementary Figure 16B ) . Although we did not ﬁ nd any association between SNP rs112146896 and the thickness of SFG , collectively the 105 common SNPs show signi ﬁ cant similarity between the genetic contributions to lifetime 5 - binge drinking and the thickness of SFG ( P = 0 . 0153 based on 10 . 000 permuta - tion ) , but not so between the genetic contributions to lifetime drinking frequency and the thickness of SFG ( P = 0 . 801 based on 10 . 000 permutation ) . Altogether , these ﬁ ndings further support a role of EFhd2 in cortical maturation and the control of alcohol drinking . 79 DISCUSSION Here we identi ﬁ ed EFhd2 as a common genetic determinator for high - risk personality traits sensation - seeking / low anxiety and the escalation of alcohol drinking . We show that the absence of EFhd2 leads to a higher preference for alcohol in mice , which then facilitates the spontaneous escalation of consumption . The lack of EFhd2 also reduces the sedative effects of alcohol , which may contribute to an enhanced consumption by diminished aversive effects . Reduced aversive effects of alcohol intake in association with low sedation and other aversive effects have so far mainly been examined with respect to serotoninergic neurotransmission , in which indeed low aversive effects correlate with high alcohol intake . 82 , 83 EFhd2 does not affect taste preference or alcohol T a b l e 1 .

Genetic base for sensation - seeking and alcohol addiction D Mielenz et al 12 Molecular Psychiatry ( 2017 ) , 1 – 17 bioavailability in mice . These ﬁ ndings translate to the human condition , where we found an association of SNP rs112146896 in the EFhd2 - coding region with the amount of alcohol drinking in non - addicted adolescents . The emotional behaviour of mice lacking EFhd2 is characterized by enhanced sensation - seeking and reduced anxiety in several tests . However , the consumption of a hedonic stimulus was not altered . This is in line with animal models of sensation - seeking showing a positive relationship between the response to a novel environment and operant alcohol self - administration in rats . 84 There is a strong relationship between sensation - seeking and arousal . 63 , 64 In our study , EFhd2 KO mice not only showed an enhanced response to a novel environment but also enhanced brain tissue NA levels , which suggests a higher baseline arousal level in EFhd2 KO mice . Our ﬁ ndings are paralleled in a human sample , which also shows an association of EFhd2 SNP rs112146896 with anxiety traits . Table 2 .

Genetic base for sensation - seeking and alcohol addiction D Mielenz et al 13 Molecular Psychiatry ( 2017 ) , 1 – 17 Enhanced sensation - seeking / low anxiety is associated with reduced impulse control and engagement in dangerous behaviour . 61 It is also uniquely associated with alcohol consump - tion through its tendency to expose individuals more frequently to alcohol as an ‘ enhancement ’ or as a ‘ stress - coping strategy ’ . 3 , 62 A limitation of this approach is that it cannot predict how rs112146896 affects the expression of EFhd2 in the human brain during development and adulthood . As behavioural associations and cortical morphology show a comparable pattern between EFhd2 KO mice and the human rs112146896 haplotype , it is likely that this haplotype is associated with reduced EFhd2 expression during development . Altogether , our ﬁ ndings suggest that the long - known association of high sensation - seeking / low - anxiety phenotype with enhanced alcohol drinking could be causally mediated by EFhd2 . The analysis of downstream consequences of reduced EFhd2 function in mice showed altered activity in monoaminergic systems . There was a reduced dopaminergic and enhanced nor - adrenergic tone in the Nac and enhanced noradrenergic activity in the Nac and PFC . Serotonin activity did not depend on EFhd2 . Furthermore , EFhd2 appears to limit the DA response to an alcohol challenge in the Nac , but not in the PFC . This points to a dissociation of EFhd2 involvement in DA neurons of the mesolimbic vs the mesocortical system . Reduced basal DA level and enhanced Nac DA response to alcohol implies that the delta in DA activity after drug treatment , which determines the reward magnitude , 85 is much enhanced when EFhd2 is lacking . This is consistent with the sensation - seeking phenotype 12 , 86 and with the enhanced consumption of alcohol in EFhd2 KO mice . It further supports the view that a common end path leading to enhanced drug preference in sensation - seeking individuals is the enhanced sensitivity of the dopaminergic system to pharmacological reward . 29 , 87 , 88 Altogether , the neurochemical endophenotype suggests that EFhd2 provides resilience to alcohol consumption by reducing DA activation - mediated reward magnitude of alcohol . The establishment of drug - seeking and consumption involves numerous active learning processes , 3 , 89 which require synaptic plasticity . 4 , 80 , 90 In line , both downregulation as well as over - expression of EFhd2 in primary CNs increased dendrite and spine formation . The lack of EFhd2 may therefore contribute to a hyper - plasticity at cellular level , which favours the fast establishment of those alcohol - related memories that are mediated by meso - cortical monoamine systems as it was observed for other addictive drugs . 80 Accordingly , upstream from altered function of mono - aminergic systems appeared a considerable number of genes that are differentially expressed in the PFC of EFhd2 KO mice . They included genes involved in developmental processes , cell surface receptor signalling pathways , DA biosynthetic processes and forebrain neuronal differentiation . These ﬁ ndings appear in line with altered basal DA levels on the one hand and reduced cortical development on the other hand . The latter was con ﬁ rmed by the ﬁ nding that EFhd2 is required for full cortical , but not hippocampal maturation , in mice .

Genetic base for sensation - seeking and alcohol addiction D Mielenz et al 14 Molecular Psychiatry ( 2017 ) , 1 – 17 adolescents , 55 and , thus , adds to the risk pro ﬁ le induced by reduced EFhd2 activity . This is most likely mediated by reduced cognitive impact on impulse control and drug - taking behaviour . 12 In how far an EFhd2 dysfunction and resulting cortical de ﬁ cits contribute to symptoms of other psychiatric disorders such as , for example , schizophrenia has to be determined in future studies . The mesocorticolimbic system constitutes a regulatory circuit involving the PFC , the Nac and the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) , whereby the PFC projects to the Nac and the VTA to control mesolimbic DA projections that modulate rewarding behaviour . 91 In support of a role of the PFC in the EFhd2 - controlled rewarding response , EFhd2 was more expressed in the PFC than in Nac or VTA ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . We found that a loss of EFhd2 can control transcriptional changes in the PFC , thereby controlling mesocorticolimbic projections . Alcohol consumption was asso - ciated with differential expression of several gene expression modules that include genes known to be crucial for the establishment of alcohol consumption , including genes involved in long - term potentiation and glutamatergic synapses . 68 , 92 How - ever , there was very little interaction between EFhd2 and alcohol on gene expression pro ﬁ les . We propose that EFhd2 controls gene expression in a way that controls behavioural traits and the risk of alcohol consumption initiation , but does not control the way how alcohol itself affects gene expression after consumption . This interpretation is in accordance with the reversal of the addictive phenotype by β - carboline . However , it does not exclude the possibility that gene expression after the loss of EFhd2 is not modulated in other areas of the brain such as the Nac or the VTA . In conclusion , we identify that EFhd2 / Swiprosin - 1 is a common genetic determinator for sensation - seeking / low anxiety and alco - hol addiction . We showed that a lack of EFhd2 induces high - risk personality traits associated with enhanced alcohol consumption . The resilience provided by EFhd2 and co - regulated genes may work by its control of monoamine basal activity and DA - mediated alcohol reward magnitude in the mesolimbic system of the brain on the one hand . On the other hand , EFhd2 and co - expressed genes are required for full cortical development and , thereby , indirectly control personality traits and alcohol consumption levels . These data would support preventive approaches using EFhd2 expression as a predictive marker during development and for therapeutic approaches in alcohol addiction treatment that enhance EFhd2 activity .
