ResouRces Research - Technology Management ‚Ä¢ May‚ÄîJune 2023 | 71 Generative AI Jim euchner Wow ! That was fast ! ChatGPT reached one million users in five days , much faster than any previous online tool . OpenAI . org released ChatGPT to the public in November 2022 , just four months before the writing of this article . In many ways , it seems premature to provide a set of resources for something that is still so new . Yet it is also necessary to do so . ChatGPT and its fellow gener - ative AI applications are already being applied in a dizzying array of applica - tions , so leaders of innovation , R & D , and IT need to engage . I write this with the knowledge that many specific ref - erences in this article will be superseded by newer articles but with the confi - dence that they will help those who are interested to get started . Where to start The best place to start is likely with understanding what generative AI is and what it is not . In brief , generative AI uses a very large corpus of data‚Äî text , images , or other labelled data‚Äîto create , at the request of users , new ver - sions of text , images , or predicted data . Much of the recent buzz has been around the large language models ( LLMs ) used by ChatGPT and Bing AI , and of image - generation models like DALL - E and Stable Diffusion . These generative AI tools let users create professional sounding text and interest - ing images using an English - language prompt . These applications , though much in the news , are only a part of generative AI . There are also applications closer to R & D in science and design . Autodesk has , for many years , incorporated fea - tures into its design software that use goals and constraints set by users to generate and test physical designs . Some of the tests include strength test - ing and modelling of thermal flows ( see Autodesk . com‚Äôs ‚ÄúGenerative Design‚Äù ) . Moderna has applied some of the same principles to generate potential pharmaceutical molecules and to filter which of these should be explored in the laboratory . Competing in the Age of AI by Marco Iansiti and Karim Lakhani pro - vides detail on this case study . It explains , in part , how Moderna was able to respond so quickly to the COVID - 19 virus . You may also want to read my interview with Marco Iansiti , ‚ÄúCorporate Operating Models in the Age of AI , ‚Äù pub - lished in Research Technology - Management ( RTM ) . Generative AI has also been very suc - cessful in complex domains that can be explicitly modelled . Demis Hassabis dis - cusses the topic in his IRI Medalist paper , ‚ÄúDeepMind : From Games to Scientific Discovery , ‚Äù also published in RTM . AlphaGo , one of the products of the lab ( now owned by Alphabet , Inc ) , learned to play and win Go using deep learning techniques trained through games with people . AlphaGo Zero , its successor , used generative AI : it became a world champion by generating moves for an opponent and playing against itself . Similar technology has been used , for example , to solve the complex biol - ogy problem of protein folding . These are exciting R & D applications of generative AI . In her article ‚ÄúBeyond ChatGPT : The Future of Generative AI for Enterprises‚Äù for Gartner , Jackie Wiles provides several other examples , including generative AI in drug design , material science , chip design , and the design of parts . You can learn about generative AI and LLMs from various sources . ChatGPT , when prompted to provide ‚ÄúThe top 10 resources to understand generative AI , ‚Äù led with the book Generative Deep Learning : Teaching Machines to Paint , Write , Compose , and Play by David Foster . ChatGPT notes that ‚ÄúThis book is an excellent introduc - tion to generative AI and covers a wide range of topics , including deep learning , GANs [ generative adversarial networks ] , and VAEs [ variational autoencoders ] . ‚Äù ChatGPT also recommends the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization , taught by Andrew Ng , a well - known AI researcher . Currently , 744 , 435 people have already enrolled . There are many more resources , which let you can dig into the technology at whatever level of depth you desire . Text Generation and Image Generation ChatGPT and Bing AI are based on LLMs . Their underlying machine learn - ing algorithms are trained on massive amounts of text and are designed to predict what the next word or phrase in a sentence or paragraph might be . They do not search and synthesize but use mathematical models to select the best next word . The prompt seeds the generation . In the case of images , generative algo - rithms use past images of cats or space ships or trees , together with labels about styles or schools of art , to generate images Copyright ¬© 2023 , Innovation Research Interchange .

We welcome your contributions , in the form of suggestions for topics and of column submissions . 72 | Research - Technology Management Resources of , for example , ‚Äúa cat flying a space ship over trees , in surrealist style . ‚Äù Again , the key is the training of immense amounts of tagged data to generate new images from an amalgam of related old images . Much has been written about these systems in the past few months , in all kinds of popular media , most of it based on experiments that reveal both the potential and the limitations of the tools . Here are a few that I found inter - esting . New York Times technology col - umnist Kevin Roose wrote a now famous column‚Äî‚ÄúBing‚Äôs A . I . Chat : ‚ÄòI Want to Be Alive . üòà ‚Äò‚Äù‚Äîabout his interaction with Bing‚Äôs AI chatbot , Sydney . The dialog became strange and almost creepy , but it was illuminating about how these LLMs work . Cade Matz , also of the New York Times , provides background on the underlying technology . In an article ‚ÄúWhy Chatbots Sometimes Act Weird and Spout Nonsense , ‚Äù he notes that these tools are part of an evolution of capabilities . ‚ÄúMost people use neural networks every day , ‚Äù he observes . ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the technology that identifies people , pets and other objects in images posted to internet services like Google Photos . It allows Siri and Alexa . . . to recognize the words you speak . And it‚Äôs what translates between English and Spanish on services like Google Translate . ‚Äù The space is moving quickly . Bing‚Äôs AI , which integrates ChatGPT with the Internet , brings significant advantages over ChatGPT alone . Ethan Mollick , in a post titled ‚ÄúPower and Weirdness : How to Use Bing AI , ‚Äù gives tips for framing prompts ( and sequences of prompts ) to get good results . He sug - gests asking Bing AI to do some Internet research as part of the project . We will learn over time about the idiosyncra - sies of these tools , and they will learn ways that make us less needful of this learning . PRINT David Foster . 2019 .

Zulie Rane , a tech writer , tried to use ChatGPT on a client assignment . Her essay ‚ÄúI Paid a Professional to Edit a ChatGPT - Written Article ‚Äì Hilarity Ensued , ‚Äù points out the many ways in which the work was below her professional standards . Experiments like these are exposing the limitations of ChatGPT but also the ways that humans can work with it to good effect . Image generation tools seem more mature , perhaps because the results are inherently subjectively judged . Kevin Kelly , Wired Magazine‚Äôs founding execu - tive editor , wrote ‚ÄúEngines of Wow‚Äù about the current collection of image gen - eration AI tools like DALL - E ( OpenAI ) , Stable Diffusion , Imagen ( Google ) , Parti ( Google ) , and Mindjourney . Kelly paints an enchanting picture of augmented human intelligence enabled by these models and how they will help our cre - ativity . He notes something that is import - ant : ‚Äú ( T ) he best applications . . . are the result not of typing in a single prompt but of very long conversations between humans and machines . ‚Äù experiments Once you have some idea of how these tools work ( and maybe , even before you do ) , experiment with them . You will be amazed both at their capabilities and at their limitations . As I noted in a recent editorial ‚ÄúAlmost Human‚Äù in the last issue of RTM , I first experimented with these tools by writing a four - paragraph essay comparing The Sun Also Rises with Babbitt ( a high school assignment I once had ) . I thought that it did passably well , but my son , who teaches English to 10 th graders , was not impressed . Next , I tried creating a Christmas card using a combination of ChatGPT and DALL - E . The text was clich√©d and lacking authenticity , but it was written in good English and might have worked on a Hallmark card . The image for ‚Äúan outside in Christmas tree‚Äù created a much better design than I could have‚Äî creative and unpredictable . My third experiment was to attempt to use ChatGPT to find a thread among disparate articles published in RTM‚Äôs March ‚Äì April 2023 . The results were interesting but weak . I decided that the tool could be useful in creating a col - umn but not in writing it . Out of curiosity , for a fourth experi - ment , I asked ChatGPT , ‚ÄúWhat are the best articles written by Jim Euchner ? ‚Äù It gave me a list of five ‚Äúnotable arti - cles . ‚Äù Here is the thing . I did not author any of the articles it cited ( though they are the kind of articles I might have writ - ten ) . I thought that I might have been cited in the articles it lists , but I cannot even find these articles . They seem to be entirely made up . This is an example of what some people call ChatGPT‚Äôs hallucinations . The latter experiment put a tempo - rary damper on my enthusiasm for ChatGPT . It helped me to understand that ChatGPT generates text ; it doesn‚Äôt look up facts to instantiate that text . It really doesn‚Äôt care . It reflects , in many cases , what might be true rather than what is factual . The fact that it writes so well makes it more believable than it should be . use cases A key question for those considering these tools is to understand what they are good for and what they are unable to do . At this point , you will have to figure some of this out for yourself through your own experiments . ChatGPT itself makes bold claims as to its utility : I am ChatGPT , a large language model trained by OpenAI . I am designed to understand natural lan - guage and generate human - like responses to text - based questions or prompts . I have been trained on a vast corpus of text data and can gen - erate responses on a wide range of topics , including science , technology , business , entertainment , and more . I use machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks to under - stand the meaning behind text - based inputs and generate responses that are both informative and coherent [ italics added ] . My goal is to provide helpful and accurate information to users and assist them in their quest for knowledge . ChatGPT‚Äôs ambitions are clear . What is not clear , however , is the claim that it understands meaning ( as we might understand meaning ) or that its responses are ‚Äúboth informative and coherent‚Äù ( at least not yet ) . The potential applications of these tools are nevertheless broad‚Äîif they are used in the proper way . According to Andri Peetso , who created Conturata and teaches a seminar on the topic , ChatGPT has been used successfully ‚Ä¢ To write routine correspondence ( for example , from a doctor to appeal compensation decisions to insurance companies ) ; ‚Ä¢ To brainstorm characters or plot ideas for stories or headlines ; ‚Ä¢ To write code or to translate code from one language to another ; ‚Ä¢ To improve the grammar of written text ; ‚Ä¢ To summarize a longer article ; and ‚Ä¢ To write in the voice of a particular persona . It runs into problems when ‚Ä¢ It is asked to provide specific factual information ( though Bing AI is attempting to address this ) ; ‚Ä¢ It is drawn into error by its user ; ‚Ä¢ It is anthropomorphized ; or ‚Ä¢ It is used as a blind substitute for a writing task . Michael Chui , Robert Roberts , and Lareina Yee of McKinsey take a more macro perspective . In ‚ÄúGenerative AI is here : How tools like ChatGPT could change your business , ‚Äù they discuss the potential uses of generative AI across business functions , including marketing and sales , operations , engineering , legal , and R & D . They provide an extensive list of potential use cases . To get the most use out of these tools , people are beginning to develop skills in what Andri Peetso calls ‚Äúprompt engi - neering . ‚Äù Good prompts get better results , and prompt sequences ( frame - works ) can be developed and reused . Peetso provides a list of useful prompt sequences at www . conturata . com / ai . He notes that job descriptions for ‚Äúprompt engineers‚Äù are starting to appear . All of these tools , at present , seem to work best in collaboration with people . That is the thread that runs through the success stories . Nicki Case wrote about this kind of collaboration in a piece on 74 | Research - Technology Management Resources chess several years ago in ‚ÄúHow to Become a Centaur , ‚Äù which chronicled the superiority of good chess players working with good computers over world chess champions and chess super - computers , Case made the point , at least for this instance , of the benefits of human / machine collaboration . ethics One of the first reactions of people upon using ChatGPT is that it will lead to cheat - ing , whether at school or at work . It is certainly causing a reassessment of what it means to create . People have responded in diametrically opposed ways‚Äîby seek - ing to prevent unauthorized use of the tools or by embracing them . The first school has created AI detec - tors , developed less to catch cheating students than to prevent bots from post - ing on the net and getting crawled by search engines . Andri Peetso teaches how to work around such detectors in order to make the text more human , but the AI detector group continues its quest and seeks to detect the work - arounds . It is like Dr . Seuss‚Äô story of the Sneetches . Ethan Mollick takes a different approach . He expects his students to use AI in their work but to disclose that they are doing so , including the prompts that they have used along the way . In his post on the topic , ‚ÄúAll my classes suddenly became AI classes , ‚Äù he discusses how AI should be integrated into curricula . Gideon Lichfield of Wired wrote , ‚ÄúHow WIRED Will Use Generative AI Tools , ‚Äù which lays out how at least one publisher will and will not use tools like ChatGPT and what disclosure they will make to readers when they do . Others have pointed out that these tools have residual biases , especially political biases . These seem to be embed - ded in the filters rather than in the LLMs themselves . Elon Musk , who was one of the original investors in OpenAI , is so concerned about this he has announced the intent to build new AI tools that are not biased . What‚Äôs Next with Generative AI ? As Kevin Kelly has pointed out , all new technologies go through a cycle . Today many people see the limitations of these technologies more than they envision their eventual benefit . But the pace of innovation and their breadth of applicability promises a significant future impact . Some even see generative AI as defin - ing a new era . The article ‚ÄúChatGPT Heralds an Intellectual Revolution , ‚Äù pub - lished in the Wall Street Journal , for exam - ple , is one example , authored by Henry Kissinger , Eric Schmidt , and Daniel Huttenlocher . They believe that the core technology will ‚Äútransform the human cognitive process as it has not been shaken up since the invention of print - ing , ‚Äù which is no small claim coming from these authors . It is time to explore their applicability in your industry .
