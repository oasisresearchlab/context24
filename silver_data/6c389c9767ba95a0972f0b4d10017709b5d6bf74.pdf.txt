Although the contribution of actin ﬁlaments and microtubules to the mechanics of cells has been investigated in great detail , relatively little is known about the contribution of the third major cytoskeletal component , intermediate ﬁlaments ( IFs ) . To determine the role of vimentin IF ( VIF ) in modulating intracellular and cortical mechanics , we carried out studies using mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( mEFs ) derived from wild - type or vimentin (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . The VIFs contribute little to cortical stiffness but are critical for regulating intracellular mechanics . Active microrheology measurements using optical tweezers in living cells reveal that the presence of VIFs doubles the value of the cytoplasmic shear modulus to ~ 10 Pa . The higher levels of cytoplasmic stiffness appear to stabilize organelles in the cell , as measured by tracking endogenous vesicle movement . These studies show that VIFs both increase the mechanical integrity of cells and localize intracellular components . INTRODUCTION Cells are regulated by complex biochemistry but are also inherently mechanical objects . The predominant elasticity of the cell arises from the cortex , which is the stiffest part of the cell . However , it is the cytoplasm that surrounds all the key organelles , and its mechanical properties are critical for a large number of cellular processes ranging from large - scale events such as maintenance of cell shape and generation of cell motility to more localized events such as mechanotransduction , signaling , and gene regulation ( 1 ) . The cytoplasm is typically much less stiff than the cor - tex , although its mechanics have not been well quantiﬁed . In animal cells , the main contribution to cytoplasmic mechanics comes from the cytoskeleton , a scaffold that con - tains three major types of biopolymers : actin ﬁlaments , microtubules , and intermediate ﬁlaments ( IFs ) . Both actin ﬁlaments and microtubules are dynamic polymers that are essential for the movement of cells and force generation ( 2 ) . Their assembly is dependent on chemical energy derived from hydrolysis and they polymerize in a polar fashion , giving rise to highly dynamic structures that facili - tate intracellular transport and cellular adaptation to changes in the external environment . In contrast , IF assembly is apo - lar and does not require the input of chemical energy from nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis . The resulting ﬁlaments are generally considered to be more stable and mechanically robust than either actin ﬁlaments or microtubules ( 3 – 6 ) . IFs are important for maintaining the shape of cells and nuclei , and for regulating cellular motility and adhesion , and more than 80 distinct human diseases are associated with mutations in IF proteins . Even single - point mutations and deletions are manifest in severe diseases , including pos - terior cataracts ( 7 ) , various muscle diseases ( 8 ) , Alexander disease ( 9 ) , blistering skin diseases ( 10 ) , and neurodegener - ative diseases ( 11 , 12 ) . These diseases are usually related to incorrectly polymerized or organized IF structure , which in turn affects their network conﬁguration in the cellular archi - tecture ( 13 ) . This suggests that in addition to possible changes in biochemical functionality , the mechanical prop - erties of the IF networks may be dramatically altered . Recent in vitro experiments showed that cytoplasmic vimentin IFs ( VIFs ) can withstand signiﬁcantly greater mechanical deformation than either microtubules or actin ﬁlaments ( 4 ) , suggesting that vimentin may be a critical component in the mechanical integrity of cells . An in vitro study of IF networks revealed details of how IF assembly and crosslinking by divalent cations give rise to an elastic network ( 14 ) . However , the contribution of IF to intracel - lular mechanics remains unknown . In this work , we report the results of a direct measurement of the mechanical contribution of VIFs to the cell cortex and internal cytoplasm . To quantify the effect of VIFs , we used mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( mEFs ) from wild - type ( WT ) and vimentin knockout ( Vim (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) mice , as shown in Fig . 1 . We used optical tweezers to perform active microrheology to probe the internal cytoplasmic mechanics , and found that VIFs increase the cytoplasmic stiffness by a factor of 2 . The cytoplasmic stiffness is ~ 10 Pa in WT mEFs , whereas it is 5 Pa in the Vim (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs . To quantify the contribution of VIF to cytoplasmic dynamics , we tracked the ﬂuctuating intracellular movement of endogenous vesicles . We found Submitted June 27 , 2013 , and accepted for publication August 22 , 2013 . * Correspondence : weitz @ seas . harvard . edu Editor : David Piston .

Using optical magnetic twisting cytometry ( OMTC ) ( 15 – 17 ) , we also directly measured the cortical stiffness in both cell types . Interestingly , in contrast to its effect on cytoplasmic stiffness , VIFs do not signiﬁcantly change the cortical stiffness of the cell . These mechanical contributions highlight the role of VIFs as a sig - niﬁcant and important structural component of cytoplasm . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture WT and Vim (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs ( 18 ) were cultured in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 5 mM nonessential amino acids ( NEAA ) , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 100 m g / ml streptomycin , and maintained under 5 % CO 2 at 37 (cid:3) C in a humidiﬁed incubator . Cells were passaged onto glass - bottom cell culture dishes containing collagen - I - coated coverslips and allowed to grow overnight before experiments were conducted . SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as previously described ( 19 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were grown in 100 mm culture dishes and lysed in Laemmli sample buffer . Proteins separated by SDS - PAGE were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes ( Protran nitrocellulose membrane ; Whatman ) and probed with the following antibodies : mouse anti - vimentin 1 : 7000 ( clonev9 ) , mouse anti - alpha tubulin 1 : 6000 ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , and mouse monoclonal anti - actin ( clone c4 , 1 : 8000 ; Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . Peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - mouse ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) was used at 1 : 10 , 000 dilution . Blots were developed by SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate ( Thermo Scientiﬁc , Rockford , IL ) . X - ray ﬁlms were used to image the chemiluminescence signals . Immunoﬂuorescence , microscopy , and image processing Immunoﬂuorescence and microscopy were carried out as previously described ( 20 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were plated on glass coverslips , grown over - night , and ﬁxed in ice - cold methanol . The ﬁxed cells were immunostained with chicken anti - vimentin primary antibody ( Covance , Princeton , NJ ) ( 1 : 400 dilution in PBS supplemented with 0 . 01 % Tween 20 ( PBST ) ) and Alexa 488 conjugated goat anti - chicken secondary antibody ( Molecular Probes / Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ; 1 : 400 dilution in PBST ) . Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Fixed and stained cells were mounted on glass slides and imaged with a Zeiss Confocal LSM510 META microscope with oil immersion objective lenses ( Plan - Apochromat , 63 (cid:4) and 100 (cid:4) , 1 . 40 NA ; Carl Zeiss ) . Images were processed as previously described ( 18 ) . Cytoplasmic material properties measured using optical tweezers To optically trap and manipulate 500 nm beads in the cytoplasm of mEFs , we steered the beam from a variable - power Nd : YAG solid - state laser ( 4 W , 1064 nm ; Spectra Physics , Mountain View , CA ) through a series of Kep - lerian beam expanders to overﬁll the back aperture of a 100 (cid:4) 1 . 3 numerical aperture microscope objective ( Nikon S - ﬂuor ; Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . To steer the beam and manipulate the trapped bead , we used two acousto - optic deﬂectors ( NEOS Technologies , Melbourne , FL ) . Using a custom - written Labview program ( National Instruments , Austin , TX ) , we manipulated the acousto - optic deﬂectors to control the beam in the plane of the micro - scope glass slide . For detection , the bead was centered on a high - resolution , position - detection quadrant detector ( MBPS ; Spectral Applied Research , Richmond Hill , ON , Canada ) and illuminated using bright - ﬁeld illumina - tion from a 75 W Xe lamp . The linear region of the detector was calibrated by trapping a bead identical to those used in the cells in water and moving it across the detector using the acousto - optic deﬂectors in known step sizes . The trap stiffness was calibrated from the mean - squared Brownian motion of a trapped bead in water at various laser power settings using the principle of energy equipartition as previously described ( 21 ) . Once it was calibrated , the laser trap was used to optically trap and manipulate beads intracellularly . The laser power at the samplewas roughly 200 mW , corresponding to a trap stiffness of 0 . 05 pN / nm for the beads used . Trapped beads were oscillated across a frequency range of 1 – 100 Hz using the acousto - optic deﬂectors , and the laser position and bead displacement ( from which the elastic and viscous shear moduli were determined ) were recorded simultaneously . By measuring the resultant displacement of the bead , x ( u ) , subjected to an applied sinusoidal trap oscillation with a force F at frequency u , we were able to extract the effective spring constant , K ( u ) ¼ F ( u ) / x ( u ) , for a given intracellular environment . For materials with dissipation , the displacement , x , and force , f , are not in phase , which results in a complex spring constant . For a homogeneous , incompressible viscoelastic material , this spring constant is related to a complex modulus , G ¼ G 0 þ iG 00 , through a generalization of the Stokes relation K ¼ 3 p Gd ( 22 ) , where d is the bead diameter . Tracking vesicle movements To monitor intracellular movement , we tracked the motion of endogenous vesicles that budded off from cellular membranes . These refractive vesicles were visualized by bright - ﬁeld microscopy using a 633 - nm laser and a 63 (cid:4) / 1 . 2NA water immersion lens on a Leica TSC SP5 microscope . To avoid cell - boundary effects , only vesicles located away from the thin lamellar region and the nucleus , and more than ~ 1 m m deep within the cell were analyzed . This selection of vesicles avoided any interactions with the mechanically distinct cell cortex and nucleus . The trajectories of the vesi - cles were recorded every 18 ms for 30 s . Vesicle centers were determined FIGURE 1 Analysis of control ( WT ) and VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEF cells .

Biophysical Journal 105 ( 7 ) 1562 – 1568 The Role of Vimentin in Cell Mechanics 1563 by calculating the centroid of the vesicle’s brightness distributions in each image with an accuracy of 20 nm . Vesicle trajectories were tracked to calculate the time and ensemble - averaged mean - square displacement ( MSD ) , < D r 2 ( t ) > , where D r ( t ) ¼ r ( t þ t ) (cid:2) r ( t ) . Cortical stiffness measurements The mechanical properties of the cell cortex were probed using OMTC , which is a high - throughput tool for measuring adherent cell mechanics with high temporal and spatial resolution ( 15 – 17 ) . For these measurements , cells were plated on collagen - I - coated plastic dishes at a density of ~ 10 cells per mm 2 and allowed to grow overnight . Then 4 . 5 - m m ferromagnetic beads ( produced as described previously ( 23 ) ) coated with poly - L - lysine ( 4 kDa ) were incubated with the cells for 20 min to achieve strong coupling to the cell surface ( poly - L - lysine binds to the cells nonspeciﬁcally and tightly , but does not induce active remodeling of the cytoskeleton ( 24 ) ) . Unbound beads were removed by gentle washing , leaving a few beads attached to each cell . The dish was mounted on a heated microscope stage to maintain 37 (cid:3) C . Beads were magnetized by a strong , horizontal magnetic ﬁeld and then twisted by an oscillatory vertical magnetic ﬁeld at frequencies of f ¼ 0 . 1 – 1000 Hz and amplitudes of ~ 25 – 50Gauss . The motions of hundreds of beads in a ﬁeld of view were recorded with a CCD camera ( C4742 - 95 - 12ERG ; Hamamatsu ) mounted on an inverted microscope ( DM IRE2 ; Leica ) with a 10 (cid:4) objective , and the beads’ positions were determined in real time with > 10 nm accuracy by means of an intensity - weighted center - of - mass algorithm . The ratio between the torque and bead motion thus deﬁnes an apparent stiffness for a cell , which has the unit Pa / nm . A series of geometric factors based on ﬁnite - element models that take into account the cell thickness and bead - cell coupling can be used to convert the apparent stiffness into shear modulus of the cell , as discussed previously ( 15 – 17 ) . The bead - cell contact geometry was characterized by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy of labeled live cells ; beads were embedded ~ 30 % deep in WT and Vim (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs ( standard deviations ( SDs ) ¼ ~ 5 % ) , so the same geometric factors were used . Previous measurements of cortical stiffness obtained by OMTC agree with values obtained by other methods , such as atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( 25 ) . RESULTS VIFs stiffen the cytoplasm To measure cytoplasmic mechanics , we performed active microrheology using optical tweezers on single polystyrene particles that had been endocytosed by WTor Vim (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs and were randomly distributed within the cytoplasm . These 500 - nm - diameter particles were covered with lipid layers during endocytosis and thus could be transported along microtubules ; however , most of the time these particles displayed random movement . To focus on the contribution of VIF to cytoplasmic mechanics , we measured only the movement of particles located away from both the thin lamellar region and the nucleus , thereby avoiding these mechanically distinct regions of the cell . About 8 hr after addition of the particles , we used a 1064 nm solid - state laser to trap a single bead and generate a sinusoidally oscillating force F on the trapped particle ( see Materials and Methods section ) . By measuring the displacement of the trapped particle , x ( u ) , resulting from the applied oscillating force at frequency u , we were able to extract the effective spring constant , K ( u ) ¼ F ( u ) / x ( u ) , for the intracellular environ - ment . For purely elastic materials , displacement and force are in phase , whereas for materials with viscous dissipation , the displacement and force are not in phase . This enabled us to determine both the elastic spring constant , G 0 , and the viscous loss component , G 00 . Our active microrheology measurements in the cytoplasm exhibit a displacement that is almost in phase with the oscil - lating force , as shown in Fig . 2 B ; thus , the micromechanical environment in the cytoplasm of mEF cells is predominantly elastic rather than viscous . Moreover , the measured elastic modulus G 0 is consistently larger than the loss modulus G 00 over the frequency range investigated ( from 1 to 100 Hz ) . This shows that the cytoplasm of mEFs is an elastic gel instead of a viscous ﬂuid , when measured on submicron length scales . Furthermore , both the elastic modulus G 0 and the loss modulus G 00 increase with frequency , following a power - law form , j G ( u ) j ~ u b , with b z 0 . 25 . This observa - tion agrees with the power - law rheology observed previ - ously for living cells and biopolymer networks ( 15 , 26 ) . This value is also in agreement with those obtained when a cell is stretched between microplates ( b ~ 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 ) ( 27 ) or is locally externally deformed at the cortex using either magnetic tweezers or AFM ( b ~ 0 . 2 ) ( 15 , 28 ) . Although both WT and VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs show similar frequency - dependent behavior , the cytoplasmic elastic modulus , G 0 , of WT mEFs is larger than that of VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs , as shown in Fig . 3 A . Speciﬁcally , at 1 Hz the FIGURE 2 Optical - tweezers measurement of intracellular mechanics . ( A ) Schematic of the optical tweezer experiment . PEG - coated inert particles ( 500 nm ) are endocytosed into mEF cells and are then trapped and manip - ulated by a spatially sinusoidal oscillating optical trap , which generates a force F at frequency u .

Biophysical Journal 105 ( 7 ) 1562 – 1568 1564 Guo et al . cytoplasm of WT mEFs is twice as stiff as that of VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs ; thus , the presence of vimentin increases the cyto - plasmic elastic modulus from ~ 5 Pa to 9 Pa ( Fig . 3 B ) . However , the loss modulus G 00 is not signiﬁcantly different between the WT and VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells over the investigated frequency range ; the loss tangent , as deﬁned by G 00 / G 0 which represents the relative dissipation of materials , is roughly twice as large for the VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells , indicating that the presence of vimentin also reduces energy dissipation in the cytoplasm . The signiﬁcant difference in cytoplasmic moduli between WT and VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs reﬂects the contri - bution of VIF to the intracellular stiffness , suggesting that vimentin is a crucial structural cellular component within the cytoplasm . VIFs reduce intracellular ﬂuctuating movement VIFs also affect intracellular activity . To investigate how intracellular dynamics are inﬂuenced by cytoplasmic mechanics due to the VIF network , we focused on the move - ment of endogenous vesicles , small organelles that bud off from cellular membranes to form submicron carriers that facilitate intracellular transport of materials . We used bright - ﬁeld microscopy to directly track the movement of such vesicles in WTand VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs . We excluded trajec - tories from the thin actin - rich lamellar region and the mechanically distinct nucleus , focusing instead on the midplane of the cells where VIFs are typically distributed . Occasionally , the motion was clearly directed , with vesicles moving along a straight path at a constant velocity , reﬂect - ing vectorial transport along microtubules by motors . However , the majority of the motion appeared to be random , and the MSD increased linearly in time , reﬂecting the diffusive - like nature of the motion ( 29 ) . Although the trajec - tories of vesicles in both WT and VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs indicate random movements , the vesicles in VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs move farther over the same timescale , as shown in Fig . 4 A . Quantifying the trajectories by plotting the MSD of these vesicles reveals that although both of them increase linearly with time , the vesicles move an order of magnitude faster in the VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs as compared with the control WT mEFs ( Fig . 4 B ) . Additionally , the slope of the MSD is slightly larger for the VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells ( ~ 1 . 27 ) than for the WT cells ( ~ 1 . 21 ) . This increased movement in VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells is consistent with previous observations of the movements of mitochondria ( 30 ) , I melanosomes ( 31 ) , the Golgi apparatus ( 32 , 33 ) , and other organelles ( 34 , 35 ) , suggesting that VIFs may contribute to determining the localization of a variety of different organelles . VIFs do not change cortical stiffness To determine whether VIFs contribute to the cell cortical stiffness , we measured the deformation of individual mEFs resulting from forces applied through a magnetic bead bound on the cell surface , a technique called OMTC ( see diagram in Fig . 5 A ) . This technique has been used extensively to measure material properties of cells ( 15 , 16 ) and the results agree quantitatively with measurements obtained with other methods , such as AFM . We probed the force - deformation relationship over four decades of frequency range using OMTC , and calculated the elastic shear modulus , G’ , and the viscous loss component , G " , of the cell cortex from those results ( see Materials and Methods ) . The OMTC measurement reveals that the cell cortexes of both WT and VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs are solid - like , with an elastic modulus G’ much larger than the loss modulus G " over the frequency range investigated ( from 0 . 1 to 1000 Hz ) . The magnitude of shear moduli determined from the cortical OMTC measurements is two orders of magnitude larger than that of the cytoplasm . However , both G’ and G " of the cortex increase with frequency in a power - law form , as j G ( u ) j ~ u b , with b z 0 . 2 . Both the power - law form and the value of b are in accord with the behavior of the cytoplasm , as well as with previous cortical measurements ( 15 , 27 , 28 ) . Interestingly , however , there is no signiﬁcant difference in either G’ and G " between WT and VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs ( Fig . 5 B ) , suggesting that VIFs do not affect the material properties of the cell cortex , which is mainly composed of actin ﬁlaments . Thus , these measurements highlight the speciﬁc structural role of VIF in the cytoplasm rather than the cortex . DISCUSSION Eukaryotic cells withstand a wide range of passive and active forces , and they resist deformation , localize organ - elles , and maintain shape under external forces . This mechanical robustness relies critically on the cytoskeleton , which is composed of ﬁlamentous polymers and regulatory FIGURE 3 Active microrheology with optical tweezers controlling 500 nm endocytosed beads in the cytoplasm of mEFs .

The cell cortex forms a stiff shell that is mechani - cally dominated by a dense actin meshwork , which together with myosin II creates a responsive and dynamic structure . Beneath the cortex , the cytoplasm is much softer because it is composed of dilute structural proteins , organelles , and cytosol . These two distinct cytoskeletal regions create a composite network that transmits mechanical signals from the extracellular matrix to the nucleus ( 36 , 37 ) while spatially organizing and mechanically protecting cellular components ( 38 ) . Therefore , cytoplasmic mechanics play a key role in many aspects of cell function , and mechanical defects may be directly related to pathology ( 39 ) . IFs , as one of the three major ﬁlamentous polymers of the cytoskeleton , are known to be involved in regulating cell movement , contraction , and internal transport ( 40 – 42 ) ; however , their role in cytoplasmic mechanics has not yet been investigated . Our active microrheology measurements show that the cyto - plasmic shear modulus of the WT mEFs is ~ 80 % larger than that of the VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs . In comparison with the WT mEFs , the VIM (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs have the same amount of actin and tubulin , but no VIF ( Fig . 1 ) ; therefore , the difference in our measurements reﬂects the speciﬁc mechanical contri - bution of VIF . At 1 Hz , vimentin increases the cytoplasmic shear modulus from 5 Pa to 9 Pa ( Fig . 3 ) . By comparison , in vitro rheology measurements of VIF networks indicate an elastic shear modulus of a few pascals ( 26 , 43 ) . In contrast , vimentin does not have any measurable effect on the cortical stiffness , which is two orders of magnitude greater than the cytoplasmic stiffness ( Fig . 5 B ) . The substantially higher stiffness and the negligible contribution of vimentin in the cortex are both attributable to the domi - nance of the actin - rich structure of the cortex . Within the cytoplasm , actin network structures are less abundant , and therefore vimentin plays a critical role in a variety of prop - erties . In addition to mechanical changes , cells without VIF have different shapes , lower motility , and weaker adhesion ( 40 – 42 ) . Our results complement these ﬁndings by providing evidence that VIFs also contribute to the intra - cellular mechanics , suggesting that VIFs are essential for the structural integrity of cells . In addition to contributing to cell mechanics , another major role of cytoplasmic VIFs is to spatially organize the contents of the cell ( 38 ) . Eukaryotic cells have a wide variety of organelles that serve different functions , and these organelles distribute across the cell according to changing physiological needs and in addition are subjected to constant ﬂuctuations due to thermal agitation and active forces ( 29 ) . By tracking the movement of submicron lipid vesicles , we FIGURE 4 Intracellular movement of endoge - nous vesicles inside WT and Vim (cid:2) / (cid:2) mEFs .

( D ) Illustra - tion of random vesicle movement in networks with and without vimentin .

Biophysical Journal 105 ( 7 ) 1562 – 1568 1566 Guo et al . show that the VIF network indeed reduces these random ﬂuctuation of vesicles , in agreement with observations that the movement of other organelles , such as mitochondria , is conﬁned by VIFs ( 30 ) . These results suggest that cyto - plasmic VIF , as a structural polymer , also helps to localize organelles in cells . This might be a direct consequence of the increase of cytoplasmic stiffness . Since VIFs increase the cytoplasmic stiffness by ~ 80 % , this reduces the random movement of contents that are integrated in the cytoplasmic network , and effectively localizes organelles , such as the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum . This highlights how a structural biopolymer such as VIF can have an extensive and unexpected impact through its mechanical properties . We thank F . Mackintosh and A .
