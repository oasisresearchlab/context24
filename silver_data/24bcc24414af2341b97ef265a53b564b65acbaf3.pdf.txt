Biochem . J . ( 1988 ) 256 , 283 - 290 ( Printed in Great Britain ) Inhibitory effect of a marine - sponge toxin , okadaic acid , on protein phosphatases Specificity and kinetics Corinna BIALOJAN and Akira TAKAI * II . Physiologisches Institut , Universitat Heidelberg , Im Neuenheimer Feld 326 , 6900 Heidelberg , Federal Republic of Germany The inhibitory effect of a marine - sponge toxin , okadaic acid , was examined on type 1 , type 2A , type 2B and type 2C protein phosphatases as well as on a polycation - modulated ( PCM ) phosphatase . Of the protein phosphatases examined , the catalytic subunit of type 2A phosphatase from rabbit skeletal muscle was most potently inhibited . For the phosphorylated myosin light - chain ( PMLC ) phosphatase activity of the enzyme , the concentration of okadaic acid required to obtain 50 % inhibition ( ID50 ) was about 1 nm . The PMLC phosphatase activities of type 1 and PCM phosphatase were also strongly inhibited ( ID50 0 . 1 - 0 . 5 , aM ) . The PMCL phosphatase activity of type 2B phosphatase ( calcineurin ) was inhibited to a lesser extent ( ID50 4 - 5 / tM ) . Similar results were obtained for the phosphorylase a phosphatase activity of type 1 and PCM phosphatases and for the p - nitrophenyl phosphate phosphatase activity of calcineurin . The following phosphatases were not affected by up to 10 fM - okadaic acid : type 2C phosphatase , phosphotyrosyl phosphatase , inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate phosphatase , acid phosphatases and alkaline phosphatases . Thus okadaic acid had a relatively high specificity for type 2A , type 1 and PCM phosphatases . Kinetic studies showed that okadaic acid acts as a non - competitive or mixed inhibitor on the okadaic acid - sensitive enzymes . INTRODUCTION Okadaic acid ( C44H66013 ) is a monocarboxylic acid extracted from common black sponges of the genus Halichondria . The chemical structure has been deter - mined by Tachibana et al . ( 1981 ) . Recently we reported that micromolar concentrations of this substance strongly inhibit the phosphorylated myosin light - chain ( PMLC ) phosphatase activity of smooth - muscle extract ( Takai et al . , 1987 ; Bialojan et al . , 1987 , 1988 ) . Okadaic acid similarly inhibited a purified polycation - modulated ( PCM ) phosphatase from bovine aorta ( DiSalvo et al . , 1984 ) . So far , two endogenous phosphatase inhibitors , termed inhibitor 1 and inhibitor 2 , have been isolated ( Huang & Glinsmann , 1976 ) . According to Cohen ' s classification ( Ingebritsen & Cohen , 1983 ) , our PCM phosphatase is a type 2 phosphatase , since it is not affected by these endogenous inhibitors ( DiSalvo et al . , 1984 ) . To our knowledge , okadaic acid is the first substance that has been shown to inhibit type 2 phos - phatase in micromolar concentrations . Besides inhibitor 1 and inhibitor 2 , only rather non - specific phosphatase inhibitors such as NaF ( Morgan et al . , 1976 ) or vanadate ( Searle , 1983 ) have been described . In the present experi - ments we further studied the inhibitory effect of okadaic acid on type 1 , type 2A , type 2B and type 2C phosphatases as well as PCM phosphatase . The results show that okadaic acid has a relatively high specificity for type 2A and type 1 phosphatases , and that it acts as a non - competitive or mixed inhibitor for the okadaic acid - sensitive enzymes . EXPERIMENTAL Materials All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co . [ y - 32P ] ATP was obtained from NEN . Okadaic acid , isolated from the black sponge Halichondria okadai , was generously given by Dr . Y . Tsukitani ( Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) . Preparation of proteins Phosphorylatable myosin light chains were prepared from bovine myocardium by the method of Cummins & Lambert ( 1986 ) . Myosin light - chain kinase was purifed from chicken gizzards as described by Ngai et al . ( 1984 ) . Phosphorylase b and phosphorylase kinase from rabbit skeletal muscle as well as acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co . Calmodulin from pig brain was purchased from Boeh - ringer Mannheim . Calcineurin ( = type 2B phosphatase ; Klee & Krinks , 1978 ; Stewart et al . , 1982 ) from bovine brain was kindly provided by Professor C . Klee , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , U . S . A . The catalytic subunits of type 1 phosphatase and type 2A phosphatase ( type 2A , ) from rabbit skeletal muscle ( Tung et al . , 1984 ) as well as type 2C phosphatase from rabbit liver ( McGowan & Cohen , 1987 ) were generously given by Dr . G . Mieskes , G6ttingen , Germany . Aortic PCM phos - phatase was purified as described previously ( DiSalvo et al . , 1984 ) , involving chromatography on DEAE - Sepha - cel , polylysine - agarose , heparin - agarose and a Mono Q Vol . 256 Abbreviations used : PCM phosphatase , polycation - modulated phosphatase ; PMLC , phosphorylated myosin light chain . * To whom correspondence and reprint requests should be addressed . 283 C . Bialojan and A . Takai HR 5 / 5 anion - exchange column with the Pharmacia f . p . l . c . system . SDS / polyacrylamide - gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed three polypeptides corre - sponding to 72 , 53 and 35 kDa , confirming the previous report ( DiSalvo et al . , 1985 ) . According to Cohen ' s classification of protein phosphatases ( Ingebritsen & Cohen , 1983 ) this PCM phosphatase is a type 2A phosphatase because it is not affected by inhibitor 1 or inhibitor 2 ( DiSalvo et al . , 1984 ) and has a 5 - fold higher PMLC phosphatase activity than phosphorylase a phos - phatase activity ( see the Results section ) . Enzyme assays All enzymes were tested at 30 ' C . The assays were made in a buffer containing 20 mM - Tris / HCl , 0 . 5 mM - dithiothreitol and 1 mg of bovine serum albumin / ml , pH 7 . 4 . The reaction mixtures for the assays of phos - phorylase a phosphatase activity contained 5 mM - caffeine in addition . For standard assays , either 32P - labelled PMLC or 32P - labelled phosphorylase a was used as substrate . Reactions were started by injecting the 32P - labelled substrate into the reaction mixture , and stopped by addition of ice - cold trichloroacetic acid ( 20 % , w / v ) and 6 mg of bovine serum albumin / ml . Assessment of released Pi was performed by standard procedures ( Di - Salvo et al . , 1982 ) . The enzyme activity of type 1 phosphatase was measured in buffer containing 2 mM - MnCl2 . For the assay of type 2C phosphatase 11 mm - magnesium acetate was included in the buffer . The activity of calcineurin was measured with either p - nitrophenyl phosphate or PMLC as substrate . The reaction mixtures contained 40 mM - Tris / HCl , 0 . 1 M - KCI , 0 . 1 mg of bovine serum albumin / ml , 6 mM - MgCl2 , 0 . 25 mM - dithiothreitol , 0 . 1 sM - calmodulin and 0 . 1 mm - CaCl2 , pH 8 . 0 . p - Nitrophenyl phosphate phosphatase activity of calcineurin was measured by recording the initial rate of increase in absorbance at 400 nm . In the dose - inhibition analyses , the concentration of enzymes was such that less than 5 % of the radioactive substrate was consumed during the reaction time of 3 - 10 min . The consumption of p - nitrophenyl phosphate was less than 1 % of the initial concentration . In the enzyme - kinetic studies , we allowed consumption of the substrate to a maximum of 15 % of the initial concentra - tion , so as to make the measurements at the lower substrate concentration range sufficiently accurate . The effect of accumulating product ( dephosphorylated pro - tein and Pi ) was examined for the protein phosphatases as follows . The rate of dephosphorylation was measured with different concentrations of substrate ( 1 uM - , 2 # M - and 5 # uM - PMLC ; 2 / tM - , 5 / M - and 10 # M - phosphorylase a ) . For this purpose , the reaction was allowed to proceed until about 5 % of the substrate added was depleted . The rate was not significantly changed when the reaction was started in the presence of dephosphorylated products ( myosin light chains or phosphorylase b plus Pi ) equiva - lent to 15 % of the initial substrate concentration . Therefore the effect of accumulating product appeared to be negligible under the present experimental conditions . The effect of depletion ofsubstrate can be mathematically corrected ( see below ) . Alkaline phosphatases ( from bovine intestinal mucosa and pig placenta ) and acid phosphatases ( from milk and potato ) were tested by standard procedures in alkaline and citrate buffer ( Sigma kit ) respectively . p - Nitrophenol phosphate ( 0 . 1 M ) was used as a substrate and the rate of decrease in the absorbance at 400 nm was measured . Dr . E . Ulug and Dr . S . Courtneidge from the Euro - pean Molecular Biology Laboratory , Heidelberg , Ger - many , kindly performed the phosphotyrosine - specific phosphatase assays . The assays were carried out by incubating crude cell lysates from mouse NIH 3T3 cells with various 32P - labelled phosphotyrosine - containing substrates such as enolase , poly ( Glu - Tyr ) and ' in - vitro ' - autophosphorylated cell lysates . Assessment of inositol trisphosphate phosphatase was performed in Professor A . P . Somlyo ' s and Professor Y . E . Goldman ' s laboratories in Philadelphia , PA , U . S . A . , together with Dr . J . Walker from the National Institute for Medical Research , London N . W . 7 , U . K . Both a crude membrane and a cytosolic fraction of rabbit main pulmonary artery were incubated with [ 3H ] inositol trisphosphate , and the initial rate of break - down ofinositol trisphosphate was measured as described by Walker et al . ( 1987 ) . Okadaic acid was dissolved in pure dimethyl sulph - oxide and added to the experimental solution . Control solutions contained the same concentration ( 0 . 5 % , v / v ) of dimethyl sulphoxide . Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al . ( 1951 ) . Analysis of kinetic data When an enzyme reaction is monitored over an ex - tended time , the velocity of the reaction progressively slows down as a result of depletion of substrate and accumulation of product . In the present experiments , accumulation of product was limited , so that its effect on the reaction velocity could be neglected ( see above ) . The slowing down resulting from depletion of substrate was corrected for by the following mathematical procedure . Let v ( s ) be the initial steady - state velocity at a given substrate concentration s ( = [ S ] ) . When the reaction obeys the Michaelis - Menten kinetics : v ( s ) = VK + s Km , + s ( 1 ) where Km is the Michaelis constant and V is the maximal velocity ofthe reaction . The value ofv ( s ) can be estimated by measuring the mean rate of the increase of product , which is equal to the decrease of substrate , i . e . : t13 ( s ) = s - s ( t ) t ( 2 ) where O ( s ) is the estimate of v ( s ) and s ( t ) is the concentration of substrate remaining in the reaction mixture at time t [ s ( 0 ) = s ] . Because of depletion of substrate , v ( s ) < v ( s ) . We define the correction factor , f , by the following equation : v ( s ) = i ( s ) / f ( 3 ) Inserting eqns . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) into eqn . ( 3 ) , and rearranging , we have : ( Km + s ) [ s - s ( t ) ] s - V - t The integrated form of eqn . ( 1 ) is : Yt = s - s ( t ) + Kmln ( s ) ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( see Cornish - Bowden , 1977 ; Dixon & Webb , 1979 ) . 1988 284 Inhibition of protein phosphatase by okadaic acid Eliminating V - t in eqn . ( 4 ) by eqn . ( 5 ) , and rearranging , we obtain : s f = J ( S , Km , Pp ) = Kl ( 6 ) s In ( 1 - p ) Km P 95 % confidence limits . The other numerical data were described as means + S . E . M . , and differences were assessed by the Student ' s t test . The dose - inhibition relations were fitted by the linear least - squares method to the linear form of the Hill function : ln [ ( 100 - E ) / EJ = h * lnI + lnK where p = [ s - s ( t ) ] / s . The enzyme - kinetic results pre - sented have been corrected for substrate depletion by using this correction factor ( see also eqn . 3 ) . As for the present data , the values off were not less than 0 . 9 , i . e . 0 . 9 < f < 1 . Dose - inhibition relation In the following description , the apparent values of Km and V in the presence of inhibitor ( okadaic acid ) are denoted as Km ' and V ' respectively . In general , the concentration of inhibitor required to obtain 50 % inhibition ( ID50 ) is a function of substrate concentration . This fact is important when the values of ID50 are compared . The function can be mathematically derived if the dependence of initial steady - state velocity on the substrate concentration is described in the form of the Michaelis - Menten equation both in the absence and in the presence of inhibitor , and if the dose - inhibition relation is given in the form of the Hill function ( see Bialojan et al . , 1988 ) . The following equations are relevant to the present results . ( i ) When Km ' > Km and V ' < V ( mixed inhibition ) : ID50 ( s ) = K2 ( 7 ) where ID50 ( s ) is the value of ID50 at a given substrate concentration s , h is the Hill coefficient , and K1 and K2 are the constants that give the upper and lower limits of ID50 ( s ) respectively . The values of K1 and K2 are experi - mentally determined by using the relations : K1 = ( I - l I * I ( 8 ) and K2 = Km V ' ) ( 9 ) ( ii ) When Kin = Km and V ' < V ( non - competitive inhibition ) : ID50 = K1 = K2 ( constant ) ( 10 ) ( see eqns . 7 , 8 and 9 ) . The results presented have been corrected for a higher extent of substrate utilization at lower inhibitor concen - trations by using the correction factor described above ( see eqns . 3 and 6 ) . The increase of the values of h produced by the correction procedure was less than 0 . 05 in the present results . Statistics The kinetic constants of enzyme reactions were deter - mined by the direct - linear - plot method ( Eisenthal & Cornish - Bowden , 1974 ) , and evaluation of their dif - ference by a non - parametric method ( Hollander & Wolfe , 1973 ) was made in accordance with Porter & Trager ( 1977 ) with the use of computer programs . The values of the constants obtained were presented with where E is the percentage enzyme activity , I is the concentration of inhibitor , h is the Hill coefficient and KA is the association constant . The values in the range 10 % < E < 90 % were used for the fitting . The values of ID50 and Hill coefficient were compared by a method of co - variance analysis ( Snedecor & Cochran , 1980 ) . Very similar values of ID50 and Hill coefficient were obtained when the fitting was made by a non - linear least - squares method ( Snedecor & Cochran , 1980 ) . In every case , differences were evaluated as statistically significant when a two - sided probability of less than 0 . 05 was obtained .

Vertical bars indicate S . E . M . ( n = 4 - 5 ) . dose - inhibition relations were also examined for their phosphorylase a phosphatase activity ( Fig . lb ) . Para - meters of the inhibition curves are given in Table 1 . When 4 uM - PMLC was used as substrate , the catalytic subunit of the skeletal - muscle type 2A phosphatase ( type 2AJ ) was most potently inhibited ( ID50 1 . 2 nM ) . Okadaic acid also strongly inhibited PCM phosphatase ( ID50 205 nM ) and type 1 phosphatase ( ID50 315 nM ) . Calci - neurin ( type 2B phosphatase ) was inhibited to a lesser extent ( ID50 4350 nM ) . Type 2C phosphatase was not affected by up to 10 # , M - okadaic acid ( Fig . la ; for the dependence of ID50 on the substrate concentration see below . ) When 10 / gM - phosphorylase a was used as substrate , results were similar , except for PCM phosphatase , for which the value of ID50 ( 72 nM ) was considerably smaller than that for its PMLC phosphatase activity ( Table 1 ) . This seems to be related to the enzyme - kinetic nature of the phosphorylase a phosphatase activity of PCM phos - phatase ( see below ) . 80 60 - 40 20 ( a ) Km / [ PMLC ] ( b ) 10 20 Km / [ phosphorylase a ] 30 Fig . 3 .

The values are normalized to the kinetic constants deter - mined by the direct - linear - plot method ( Table 2 ) . In ( b ) the values of Km and V at higher substrate concentrations ( 10 - 80 , UM ; broken lines ) were both different from those at lower concentrations ( 0 . 5 - 5 , M ; continuous lines ) ; the constants for the substrate concentration range 0 . 5 - 5 / SM were used for normalization . See the text for further explanation . As for phosphatase 2B , the effect of okadaic acid was also tested for its p - nitrophenyl phosphate phosphatase activity in Tris buffer , pH 8 . 0 ( Fig . 2 ) . The control activity ( Table 1 ) was similar to the value [ 120 units ( nmol of Pi / min ) / mg of protein ] obtained in Professor C . Klee ' s laboratory ( personal communication ) . The dose - inhibition relation was similar to that obtained for the PMLC phosphatase activity of the enzyme in Tris buffer , pH 7 . 5 ( see also Table 1 ) . When the PMLC phosphatase activity was measured in Tris buffer , pH 8 . 0 , the control activity ( 1 . 4 units / mg of protein ) was lower than that obtained in Tris buffer , pH 7 . 5 , but the values of ID50 ( 5130 nM ) and Hill coefficient ( 0 . 95 ) were not significantly changed . The values of the Hill coefficient h tended to be smaller than 1 ( Table 1 ) , although the data were corrected for a higher extent of substrate utilization at lower inhibitor concentrations ( see the Experimental section ) . Enzyme kinetics Figs . 3 , 4 and 5 show the results of the enzyme - kinetic study . The data are presented as double - reciprocal plots . The values are normalized to the kinetic constants determined by the direct - linear - plot method ( Table 2 ) . Type 2A , phosphatase . For type 2A , phosphatase ( catalytic subunit of the skeletal - muscle type 2A phos - phatase ) the double - reciprocal plots were linear over the substrate concentration range for both PMLC phos - phatase activity and phosphorylase a phosphatase activity of the enzyme . For the PMLC phosphatase activity the values of Km and V were estimated , as de - scribed in the Experimental section , to be 3 . 8 , UM and 17200 units / mg of protein respectively ( Table 2 ) . These were significantly changed to 12 mm ( = Km ' ; P < 0 . 008 ) and 8550 units / mg of protein ( = V ' ; P < 0 . 016 ) by 5 nm - okadaic acid , indicating that okadaic acid acts as a mixed inhibitor . From the values of V ' / V ( 0 . 50 ) and Km ' / Km ( 3 . 2 ) , the upper and lower limits of the change of ID50 produced by changing the substrate concentration were estimated , by using eqns . ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) , to be 5 nM ( = K1 ) and 0 . 7 nm ( = K2 ) respectively . For the phosphorylase a phosphatase activity the Km was 8 . 2 - fold larger whereas the V was 2 . 3 - fold smaller than those for the PMLC phosphatase activity ( Table 2 ) . This qualitatively agrees with the previous report by Ingebritsen & Cohen ( 1983 ) . Okadaic acid ( 2 nM ) signifi - cantly decreased the value of V whereas it did not affect the value of Km , i . e . the inhibition was non - competitive . As expected from eqn . ( 10 ) , the value of ID50 of the dose - inhibition relation was not altered when the sub - strate concentration was changed from 10 / M to 2 UM and 20 , u / M . PCM phosphatase . When PMLC was used as substrate , the double - reciprocal plot was linear over the concen - tration range ( 0 . 5 - 10 / tM ) of PMLC examined ( Fig . 4a ) . Both Km and V were significantly ( P < 0 . 002 ) changed by 300 nM - okadaic acid ( Table 2 ) , indicating that okadaic acid acts as a mixed inhibitor . From the change of the kinetic constants , the lower and upper limits of the variation of ID50 produced by changing the substrate concentration were estimated , by using eqns . ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) , to be 60 nm and 460 nm respectively . For the phosphorylase a phosphatase activity of PCM phosphatase the double - reciprocal plot had two com - ponents ( Fig . 4b ) , one below and one above a substrate concentration of about 8 / LM ( Km / [ phosphorylase a ] = 0 . 14 - 0 . 18 ) . The values of Km and V above 8 / M substrate were both significantly different ( P < 0 . 002 ) from those below this critical concentration . In the lower substrate concentration range ( 0 . 5 - 5 / tM ) both Km and V were changed by 100 nM - okadaic acid ( P < 0 . 002 ) , i . e . the inhibition was a mixed type . In the higher concentration range ( 10 - 80 , uM ) V was decreased ( P < 0 . 002 ) whereas Km was not significantly changed by okadaic acid , i . e . the inhibition was a non - competitive type . As a consequence the dependence of ID50 on the substrate concentration was somewhat complicated ( Fig . 6 ) . In the range 0 . 5 - 8 1tM the ID50 increased , as expected from eqn . ( 7 ) ( K1 = 50 nM and K2 = 115 nM ) , as the concentration of Vol . 256 287 C . Bialojan and A . Takai ( a ) ( b ) 0 10 20 Km / ! [ PMLC ] 0 10 20 Km / [ PMLC ] Fig . 5 .

( 10 ) ( K1 = K2 = 64 nM ) . At the critical concentration ( 8 - 10 , lM ) the co - variance analysis of the dose - inhibition relation gave a significantly larger re - sidual variance ( P < 0 . 01 ) than for both sides of this concentration . [ Note the relatively large S . E . M . values in the dose - response relation for this enzyme activity ( Fig . lb ) . ] The range of variation of ID50 produced by changing substrate concentration was estimated to be 50 - 100 nm ( Fig . 6 ) . This falls within the variation range of ID50 estimated for the PMLC phosphatase activity of the enzyme ( see above ) . The control value of V was 5 . 4 - fold higher for the PMLC phosphatase activity than for the phosphorylase a phosphatase activity of the enzyme ( Table 2 ) . In this respect the substrate specificity of our PCM phosphatase has a similarity to that of type 2A phosphatase ( cf . Ingebritsen & Cohen , 1983 ) . Type 1 phosphatase and calcineurin . For these types of enzyme , kinetic studies were made with PMLC as sub - strate ( Fig . 5 ) . The values of Km were one order of magnitude larger whereas the values of V expressed in terms of the specific activity were considerably smaller than those of the PMLC phosphatase activity of PCM phosphatase ( Table 2 ) .

Dependence of ID50 on substrate concentration The effect of okadaic acid on the phosphorylase a activity of PCM phosphatase was examined with various concen - trations ( 1 - 60 uM ) of phosphorylase a . The values of ID50 of the dose - inhibition relation were plotted against the concentration of phosphorylase a . The curve and hori - zontal line show the relation expected from eqns . ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) ( see the Experimental section ) ; the kinetic constants for the lower and higher concentration ranges of phosphoryl - ase a given in Table 2 were used for computation . The Hill coefficient ( h = 0 . 96 - 0 . 98 ) was not significantly changed when the substrate concentration was varied . See the text for further detail . trations examined the inhibition was non - competitive for both enzymes ; okadaic acid changed only the values of V ( P < 0 . 02 ) . In accordance with eqn . ( 10 ) , we found that the values of ID50 of the dose - inhibition relations were not significantly altered when the substrate concentration was changed from 4 m to 1 / SM and 10 / LM . Effect on other phosphatases Neither cytosolic nor particulate - bound inositol tris - phosphate phosphatase from smooth muscle was in - hibited by up to 50 # uM - okadaic acid . No effect was found with tyrosine - specific phosphatase ( s ) from cell lysates . Alkaline phosphatases ( from bovine intestinal mucosa and pig placenta ) and acid phosphatases ( from milk and potato ) tested with p - nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate were not affected by 10 1tM - okadaic acid . However , a three - subunit phosphatase isolated from dog heart ( Kranias & DiSalvo , 1986 ) was strongly inhibited by okadaic acid ( E . G . Kranias & J . DiSalvo , personal communication ) . The enzyme expressed phosphatase activity against phospholamban and phosphorylase a ; both activities were completely inhibited by okadaic acid in micromolar concentration . DISCUSSION In previous papers we have reported that micromolar concentrations of okadaic acid potently inhibit the PMLC phosphatase activity of smooth - muscle extract and of the aortic PCM phosphatase ( Takai et al . , 1987 ; Bialojan et al . , 1987 , 1988 ) . The present results show that okadaic acid inhibits type 2A , type 1 and type 2B phosphatases as well as the PCM phosphatase . On the other hand , the following phosphatases are not affected by up to 10 / tM - okadaic acid : type 2C phosphatase , phosphotyrosyl phosphatase , inositol trisphosphate phosphatase , acid phosphatases and alkaline phosphat - ases ( the present work ) . We have also shown that okadaic acid does not affect the Ca2 + + calmodulin - dependent activity of myosin light - chain kinase or phos - phodiesterase ( Takai et al . , 1987 ) . Thus the inhibitory action of okadaic acid appears to be specific for some restricted types of protein phosphatase . The type of substrate has little effect on the inhibitory action ofokadaic acid . Essentially similar dose - inhibition relations are obtained for the PMLC phosphatase activity and the phosphorylase a phosphatase activity of type 2A . , PCM and type 1 phosphatases ( Fig . 1 ) . The p - nitrophenyl phosphate phosphatase activity of type 2B phosphatase ( calcineurin ) has nearly the same suscepti - bility to okadaic acid as its PMLC phosphatase activity ( see also Fig . 2 ) . These results support the idea that the inhibitory action of okadaic acid is enzyme - directed . The affinity of okadaic acid differs remarkably among the okadaic acid - sensitive phosphatases . The catalytic subunit of skeletal - muscle type 2A phosphatase ( type 2AJ ) is about 200 times more strongly inhibited by okadaic acid than is that of type 1 phosphatase , although there is a striking sequence homology between these catalytic subunits ( Berndt et al . , 1987 ) . The three - dimen - sional conformation of the enzyme molecule may be an important factor for the binding of okadaic acid . The aortic PCM phosphatase is a polymolecular enzyme consisting of three subunits , and belongs to the category of type 2A phosphatases ( see the Experimental section ) . This phosphatase is considerably less susceptible to okadaic acid than is type 2A , phosphatase ( Fig . 1 ) . The reason for this difference is not clear from the present results . It may imply that the aortic PCM phosphatase has a different catalytic subunit from that of the skeletal - muscle type 2A phosphatase . Another possibility is that the non - catalytic subunits make the catalytic subunit less accessible to okadaic acid . The present kinetic study has shown that okadaic acid acts as a non - competitive or mixed inhibitor of the okadaic acid - sensitive enzymes , suggesting that the bind - ing site for okadaic acid is different from that for the substrate . However , the reaction mechanism is likely to be more complicated . The Hill coefficients of dose - inhibition relations tend to be smaller than 1 even after the correction for the higher extent of substrate consump - tion at lower inhibitor concentrations ( see the Experi - mental section ) . When the Hill coefficient is not 1 , the inhibition is not ' linear ' according to Cleland ' s ( 1963 ) classification of enzyme inhibition ( see Bialojan et al . , 1988 ) . In the model of ordinary ( linear ) inhibition , the constants K1 and K2 denote the dissociation constants of inhibitor for free enzyme and enzyme - substrate respect - ively ( see Dixon & Webb , 1979 ) . If this scheme qualita - tively applies for the present results concerning the PMLC phosphatase activity of the PCM phosphatase , where the Hill coefficient ( 0 . 95 ) was close to 1 , the larger value of K1 than that of K2 may suggest that the affinity of okadaic acid for the phosphatase is considerably diminished when the substrate binds to the enzyme . The kinetic data give an explanation for the compli - cated nature of the dependence of ID50 observed for the phosphorylase a phosphatase activity of the PCM phos - phatase ( see the Results section ) . The kinetics rather abruptly change at a critical concentration , and the affinity of okadaic acid for the enzyme apparently becomes unstable at this concentration . This fact must be noted especially when phosphorylase a is used as a substrate of PCM phosphatase for studies of inhibitors . Vol . 256 289 60 - v - - , C . Bialojan and A . Takai The phenomenon is not observed for the phosphorylase a phosphatase activity of type 2A , phosphatase . There - fore the change of kinetics is likely to be due to a property of the PCM phosphatase rather than to that of phosphorylase a . To our knowledge , okadaic acid is the first - described potent substance that inhibits type 2 phosphatases as well as type 1 phosphatase . The inhibition of phosphatase is reversible , as judged from its effects on myosin light - chain phosphorylation ( Bialojan et al . , 1988 ) . Therefore okadaic acid may serve as a unique tool for analysing phosphorylation - regulated systems . We thank Professor J . C . Ruegg for continuous encouragement , Professor J .
