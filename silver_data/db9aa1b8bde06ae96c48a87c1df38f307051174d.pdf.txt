The Rho - family GTPase , Cdc42 , can regulate the actin cytoskeleton through activation of Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family members . Activation relieves an autoinhibitory contact between the GTPase - binding domain and the carboxy - terminal region of WASP proteins . Here we report the autoinhibited structure of the GTPase - binding domain of WASP , which can be induced by the C - terminal region or by organic co - solvents . In the autoinhibited complex , intramolecular interactions with the GTPase - binding domain occlude residues of the C terminus that regulate the Arp2 / 3 actin - nucleating complex . Binding of Cdc42 to the GTPase - binding domain causes a dramatic conformational change , resulting in disruption of the hydrophobic core and release of the C terminus , enabling its interaction with the actin regulatory machinery . These data show that ‘intrinsically unstructured’ peptides such as the GTPase - binding domain of WASP can be induced into distinct structural and functional states depending on context . Proteins in the Ras superfamily of small GTPases regulate a vast array of cellular processes , ranging from growth and differentiation to vesicle trafﬁcking . Members of the family cycle between active GTP - bound and inactive GDP - bound states , and thereby act as molecular switches in signal transduction pathways linking cell - surface receptors to intracellular machinery 1 . The Rho subfamily of Ras - like GTPases functions in signalling pathways that control cytoskeletal structure , gene expression , cell - cycle progression and tumour metastasis 2 . The three principal members of this group , Cdc42 , Rac and Rho , are each capable of inducing distinct actin - based structures in cells , ﬁlopodia , lamellipodia and stress ﬁbres , respectively 2 . Rho acts predominantly through the bundling of pre - existing actin structures , whereas Cdc42 and Rac stimulate de novo actin polymerization , a process that can be mediated by members of the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family 3 . Mutations in the archetypal member of this group , WASP , lead to the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome , a paediatric disorder characterized by actin cytoskeletal defects in haematopoietic cells , leading clinically to thrombocytopenia , eczema and immunodeﬁciency 4 . The WASP proteins signal to the cytoskeleton through the Arp2 / 3 complex , an actin - nucleating assembly that regulates the structure and dynamics of actin ﬁlament networks at the leading edge of the cell 3 . WASP family members , including WASP , the widely expressed neuronal WASP ( N - WASP ) , several Scar / WAVE proteins and Bee1p / Las17p , are characterized by a central segment that is rich in proline followed by a C - terminal VCA region ( for verprolin Figure 1 Amino - acid sequences of human WASP and N - WASP with consensus secondary structure of the GBD constructs of WASP shown above . In the sequence , the CRIB motif is boxed in yellow and the conserved Arp2 / 3 binding sequences are boxed in red . Secondary structures arecoloured accordingto the functional layers describedin the text : yellow , layer1 ( residues230 – 276 ) ; blue , layer2 ( 277 – 310 ) ; andred , layer3 ( 461 – 492 ) . Although in our initial report of the Cdc42 – WASP complex 6 we described GBD1 as forming a b - hairpin with short b - strands 252 – 253 and 257 – 258 , recent analyses have revealed two additional backbone hydrogen bonds between Gly 251 and Asp 259 and sheet - like NOEs between Val 250 and Val 260 , consistent with the longer demarcation . Residues involved in the layer 1 / layer 2 interface ( + ) and in the layers 1 and 2 / layer 3 ( ﬁlled circles ) are highlighted . © 2000 Macmillan Magazines Ltd homology region ( VHR ) , coﬁlin homology region ( CHR ) , and acidic region ( AR ) ) . The VCA region binds the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin , and together these interactions lead to enhancement of actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex and rapid formation of new actin ﬁlaments . In contrast to their common carboxy termini , the amino termini of WASP proteins are distinct , enabling family members to activate Arp2 / 3 in response to different upstream signals . The N termini of WASP and N - WASP contain a 16 - residue sequence , termed a CRIB ( for Cdc42 / Rac interactive binding ) motif , which is found in a number of otherwise unrelated effectors of Cdc42 and Rac 5 . Both WASP and N - WASP bind activated Cdc42 through a GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) that consists of the CRIB motif and surrounding sequences . We have reported the structure of a Cdc42 – WASP GBD complex which reveals that the conserved CRIB residues form a linear epitope at the N terminus that anneals to the b 2 strand of the GTPase , whereas C - terminal residues fold into a b - hairpin and a - helix that pack against Switch I and II ( ref . 6 ) . In N - WASP , the GBD is also capable of binding the C - terminal VCA region 7 , resulting in autoinhibition of the Arp2 / 3 - stimulatory activity of the protein 7 , 8 . Binding of Cdc42 is believed to cause a structural transition in N - WASP that results in dissociation of its intramolecular contacts and enhanced Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization 7 , 8 . Thus , by activating N - WASP , Cdc42 controls the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex and subsequent actin dynamics necessary for formation of ﬁlopodia . Here we report that , like N - WASP , the WASP GBD can bind its own VCA domain in a manner that is competitive with Cdc42 . Although the GBD is largely unstructured in the free state , binding of the VCA region or addition of small amounts of organic co - solvent induces formation of a compact , folded domain structure in residues immediately C - terminal to the CRIB motif . In this auto - inhibited state , the CHR forms an amphipathic helix that packs against a hydrophobic surface of the GBD , explaining its decreased afﬁnity for actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex . Notably , this fold of the GBD is sterically incompatible with the activated conformation seen in the Cdc42 complex . Comparison of the conformations and biochemical properties of these two GBD states reveals the struc - tural and thermodynamic basis of activation of WASP - family proteins by Cdc42 . WASP GBD binding to the VCA region To determine whether WASP and N - WASP can be regulated similarly , we examined the binding of a series of WASP VCA - derived fragments to several GBD constructs . The VCA constructs were prepared as glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion proteins , spanning residues 420 – 502 ( VCA ) , 420 – 499 ( VC D A ) , 433 – 499 ( D VC D A ) , 446 – 499 ( C D A ) , 461 – 492 ( C ) , 420 – 492 ( VC ) and 420 – 482 ( V D C ) . Binding partners for these sequences included GBD1 ( residues 230 – 288 , the minimal high - afﬁnity Cdc42 - binding domain 6 , 9 ) , GBD2 ( residues 230 – 310 ) , GBD3 ( residues 225 – 310 ) and GBD4 ( residues 242 – 310 , lacking a portion of the CRIB motif ) ( Fig . 1 ) . To identify the minimal GBD - binding region of the VCAdomain , we carried out an afﬁnity titration assay that was based on the saturable change in tryptophan ﬂuorescence of GBD3 upon the addition of thrombin - cleaved VCA constructs ( Fig . 2a ) . All CHR - containing constructs bound GBD3 with similar afﬁnities , whereas the V D C peptide that lacks the latter portion of the CHR proved unable to bind GBD3 . These results indicate that the CHR of the VCA domain is both sufﬁcient and necessary for interaction with the WASP GBD . We then sought to identify the minimal VCA - binding region of the GBD . GBD2 , GBD3 and GBD4 all bound immobilized CHR - containing constructs equally well , indicating that the basic region at the N terminus of GBD3 is not required for formation of the complex , in contrast to previous hypotheses 7 ( Fig . 2a ; Fig . 2b , lanes 2 and 3 ) . However , C - terminal GBD residues are essential for binding , as GBD1 failed to interact signiﬁcantly in the GST - afﬁnity assays ( Fig . 2b , lanes 4 and 5 ) . These results indicate that formation of the intramolecular complex requires sequences of the GBD that are C - terminal to the CRIB motif , but not the entire CRIB motif . Binding of the N - WASP GBD to either Cdc42 or to VCA peptides is mutually exclusive 7 . WASP behaves in a similar manner : incuba - tion of the immobilized GST - C – GBD3 complex with Cdc42 - GMPPNP ( a nonhydrolysable GTP analogue ) effects release of the GBD into solution ( Fig . 2b , lanes 7 and 8 ) . Cdc42 - GDP , which binds WASP only weakly , does not dissociate the GBD from the VCA peptides ( Fig . 2b , lane 6 ) . Thus , for both WASP and N - WASP , interactions between the GBD and VCA regions are incompatible with Cdc42 binding , and GTPase - mediated disruption of an auto - inhibitory complex probably has an important role in signalling to the cytoskeleton . To elucidate the mechanism of WASP - family activation by Cdc42 , we examined the conformational states of both the unbound and VCA - bound GBD .

Far - ultraviolet CD molar ellipticity recorded at 25 8 C at 222nm ( ﬁlled squares ) and melting temperature ( open squares ) of 10 m M GBD2 at different concentrations ( v / v ) of TFE . © 2000 Macmillan Magazines Ltd conditions in vitro 6 , 9 . As expected 10 , small amounts of alcoholic solvents ( for example , 2 , 2 , 2 - triﬂuoroethanol ( TFE ) , methanol , isopropanol ) cause a marked increase in the helical content of the peptide as indicated by circular dichroism ( CD ) spectra , which reaches a plateau at , 10 % co - solvent ( Fig . 2d ) . However , this increased helicity correlates with a signiﬁcant increase in denatura - tion temperature of the peptide , which rises from 39 8 C in the absence of organic solvents to a maximum value of 54 8 C at 8 – 12 % TFE ( Fig . 2d ) , a ﬁnding more consistent with induction of a folded core than with induction of random helical coils . We reasoned that this fold might mimic that of the GBD – VCA complex . The NMR spectra of these states supported this hypothesis . Multidimensional spectra of aqueous GBD2 show poor dispersion of amide and aliphatic proton chemical shifts , with large variations in peak shape and intensity ( see Supplementary Information ) . Only , 75 % of the expected backbone amide peaks are visible in 1 H / 15 N - HSQC ( heteronuclear single quantum coherence ) spectra , and all amide protons exchange rapidly with solvent . However , the peptide chain is monomeric and relatively compact based on analytical ultracentrifugation and gel - ﬁltration analyses , respectively ( not shown ) . Together , these data suggest that GBD2 samples multiple , loosely packed conformations in aqueous solution . In contrast , 1 H / 15 N - HSQC spectra of 15 N - GBD2 in the presence of 5 % TFE and of 15 N - GBD3 in the presence of saturating unlabelled VCA ( see Supplementary Information ) reveal a marked increase in amide chemical shift dispersion , a decrease in most line widths , development of relative uniformity in peak shapes , and appearance of virtually all expected backbone amide resonances . Under both conditions , a number of backbone amide protons exchange slowly with solvent ( 14 with TFE , 31 with VCA peptide ) , based on their observation in 1 H / 15 N - HSQC spectra of lyophilized samples freshly dissolved in D 2 O + 10 % 2 H 3 - TFE or in D 2 O . Signiﬁcantly , amide and aliphatic resonances are highly similar in the two systems , including 1 H / 15 N - HSQC cross - peak patterns and a distinctive upﬁeld methyl resonance at - 0 . 1 p . p . m . , which suggests packing of this group against the face of an aromatic ring . This global similarity was preserved in spectra of the minimal GBD4 – C com - plex , with the absence of only several intense , poorly dispersed signals representing disordered residues . These features of the GBD / TFE and GBD / VCA NMR spectra strongly suggest that TFE and the VCA peptide induce a common discrete GBD fold with a well packed hydrophobic core . Notably , GBD spectra recorded in the presence of Cdc42 reveal a very different cross - peak pattern , and the absence of the high ﬁeld methyl resonance , indicating that the fold of the polypeptide is distinct in the two states ( see Supplementary Information ) . Autoinhibited structure of the WASP GBD To understand the nature of the autoinhibited WASP conformation and its relationship to the complex with Cdc42 , we determined the NMR solution structures of a GBD – VCA complex and the GBD alone in the presence of 5 % TFE . In the former case , we covalently joined the GBD4 and C constructs into a single chain through a ﬂexible ( Gly - Gly - Ser ) 2 sequence ( GBD4 – C ) . This linked construct was monomeric by analytical ultracentrifugation and gel ﬁltration ( not shown ) . Cross peaks in 1 H / 15 N - HSQC spectra of GBD4 – C nearly superimpose with a subset of peaks in spectra of the larger GBD3 – VCA complex and of a wild - type construct spanning residues 230 – 502 ( not shown ) , indicating that the minimal con - struct is representative of the intramolecular complex in full - length WASP . Table 1 gives statistics describing the ﬁnal set of 20 converged conformers for GBD2 in 5 % TFE and for GBD4 – C . Figure 3 shows the best - ﬁt superpositions of the conformers . Residues in the well - deﬁned core of the TFE structure , 250 – 310 , show 0 . 83 6 0 . 20 A˚ root - mean - square deviation ( r . m . s . d ) from the average coordinates for backbone atoms , and 1 . 33 6 0 . 16 A˚ r . m . s . d . for all heavy atoms , whereas the corresponding 250 – 310 and 463 – 478 regions in the complex display 0 . 34 6 0 . 08 A˚ r . m . s . d . for backbone atoms and 0 . 82 6 0 . 10 A˚ r . m . s . d . for all heavy atoms . In both structures , the N - terminal residues , which encompass the conserved CRIB motif , show no long - range nuclear Overhauser effects ( NOEs ) until residue 250 , poor chemical shift dispersion , and negative or weakly positive backbone amide heteronuclear 15 N { 1 H } NOEs ( not shown ) , indicating high levels of mobility in solution . In contrast , C - terminal residues 250 – 310 form a globular domain consisting of a short i + 4 b - hairpin ( 252 – 253 and 257 – 258 ) and four a - helices ( roughly 267 – 273 , a 1 ; 277 – 281 , a 2 ; 284 – 295 , a 3 ; and 298 – 310 , a 4 ; see Figs 1 , 4a , c ) . In these four helices , the f / w angles for the two structures are nearly identical , with minor exceptions at the initial and ﬁnal residues of a 1 and a 4 . The intramolecular complex also contains a ﬁfth helix , a 5 , which encompasses residues in the ﬁrst half of the designated CHR ( 466 – 479 ) . Residues after 479 also appear to be mobile in solution on the basis of the criteria listed above . Thus , although residues 483 – 492 are clearly needed for high - afﬁnity binding to the GBD ( Fig . 2a – c ) , their contribution to binding energy must occur through mechanisms that do not rely on ordering of the peptide backbone . The b - hairpin , demarcated by two backbone hydrogen bonds between Asp 253 and Gly 257 , forms a , 90 8 angle with the a 1 helix , creating an L - shaped amphipathic surface ( Fig . 4c ) . A short turn at residues 259 – 262 separates the ends of the hairpin and directs the Val 260 side chain toward the core of the domain . The turn is stabilized by a backbone hydrogen bond between the Asp 259 carbonyl and the Asn 262 amide , and by hydrophobic packing of Val 260 against Leu 281 and Thr 282 ( Fig . 4c ) . This ﬁrst layer of elements packs against a second layer of three roughly planar helices that form three sides of a rectangle , with a 3 aligned with the strands of the b - hairpin and a 2 and a 4 lying perpendicular to them . A hydrogen bond between the amide nitrogen of Phe 258 and the carbonyl oxygen of Leu 281 orders the b - hairpin against the a 2 and a 3 helices and provides a C - terminal cap for a 2 . Otherwise , interactions between these two layers are mostly stabilized by hydrophobic contacts , dominated by interactions between Trp articles NATURE | VOL 404 | 9 MARCH 2000 | www . nature . com 153 Figure 3 Stereoviews of the best - ﬁt superpositions of the backbone ( N , Ca , C ) atoms of the 20 ﬁnal NMR structures of GBD2 in 5 % TFE ( a ) and GBD4 – C ( b ) . Residues 230 – 249 in a , and 241 – 249 , 480 – 492 and the ( Gly - Gly - Ser ) 2 linker in b are not deﬁned by the NMR data , appear mobile in solution and have been omitted for clarity .

The close correspondence of the x 1 rotamers of these residues in the solvent - induced conformation and the intramolecular complex , with the exception only of Tyr 291 , shows that the hydrophobic cores of the two structures pack in a nearly identical fashion . This juxtaposition of the ﬁrst and second layers buries a surface area of 2 , 180 6 70 A˚ 2 and places one of the methyl groups of Leu 281 above the aromatic ring of Phe 271 , accounting for the large upﬁeld chemical shift of its methyl protons ( see Supplementary Information ) . The opposite face of the second layer consists of a bed of hydrophobic side chains emanating from helices a 1 – 4 , which are exposed to solvent in the TFE structure . In the intramolecular complex , the a 5 helix of the CHR lies nestled on this bed , forming a third structural layer and completing the core of the domain . Residues Leu 466 , Leu 470 and Met 474 of the hydrophobic face of the CHR helix ﬁll three deep pockets on the layer 2 surface , with additional extensive contacts made by Val 467 , Met 471 , Val 473 and Arg 477 ( Fig . 4d ) . These contacts bury 1 , 510 6 130 A˚ 2 of accessible surface between layer 3 and layers 1 and 2 . The orientation of the a 5 helix relative to the hydrophobic plane is stabilized by both electrostatic interactions between the side chains of Arg 477 of the helix and Glu 285 located at the top of the a 2 – a 3 turn , and hydrophobic interactions between Leu 270 in the a 1 helix and helices a 3 – 5 . The high conservation of residues at the layer 1 / layer 2 and CHR interfaces ( Fig . 1 ) indicates that WASP and N - WASP will share the same autoinhibited fold . Multiple mechanisms of stabilizing the GBD fold Preliminary 13 C a and 13 C b chemical shift assignments of aqueous GBD2 indicate that , although the isolated peptide does not exist in a single , discrete , folded conformation , a 1 is fully formed and a 4 is partially formed . In contrast , helical conformations at a 2 and a 3 are not appreciably populated 11 ( W . Hu and M . K . R . , unpublished data ) . The instability of a 2 and a 3 may be due in part to their enrichment in branched amino acids 12 , or to the abundance of acidic residues near their C termini , which could interact unfavour - ably with their helix dipoles ( Fig . 1 ) . Despite these factors , the autoinhibited fold of the GBD can be induced through two distinct mechanisms , either through the effects of organic co - solvents or by binding to the WASP VCA region . Addition of TFE , a solvent known to induce a - helix formation 10 , could stabilize the autoinhibited fold by inducing helical structure in a 2 and a 3 .

The VCA region induces structure through a distinct mechanism that may be important in understanding the activation of WASP by Cdc42 . As described previously 6 , 9 , WASP constructs spanning layer 1 or layers 1 and 2 are not folded in isolation . Similarly , CD data ( not shown ) indicate that peptides containing layer 3 exist in random coil conformations in solution . By contrast , CD data on GBD4 – C ( not shown ) show a sharp , reversible unfolding transition at 78 8 C . Together , these observations indicate that formation of the autoinhibited structure in water may be a cooperative folding process requiring all three layers , involving accretion of secondary structure in helices a 2 , a 3 and a 5 , and packing of the hydrophobic faces of these elements to form the core of the domain . The related , but mechanistically distinct , folding transitions induced by TFE and VCA peptides illustrate the different environmental factors that can inﬂuence the stability and structure of partially folded peptides such as the WASP GBD . Mechanism of autoinhibition The autoinhibited fold sequesters the a 5 helix through interactions with the GBD . This region of the CHR has been implicated in mediating actin polymerization by the WASP proteins through interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex 7 , 8 , 13 – 15 . Speciﬁcally , members of the family are thought to bind the complex in part through a conserved basic motif in the CHR ( Lys - Arg - Ser - Basic - Ala in WASP and N - WASP , residues 476 – 480 and 477 – 481 , respectively ) 16 . Deletion of Lys 473 – Lys 476 in rat N - WASP ( D cof , corresponding to residues 477 – 480 of human N - WASP ) eliminates the ability of the protein to bind the Arp2 / 3 complex 8 . Moreover , introduction of this N - WASP mutant into cells inhibits Cdc42 - mediated microspike formation 7 , and mutations in the motif are associated clinically with WAS or X - linked thrombocytopenia ( XLT ) ( see below ) . Together , these data suggest that the basic motif is essential to Arp2 / 3 binding and biological function of the WASP proteins . In the autoinhibited GBD structure , residues in the motif lie at the C terminus of the a 5 helix ( Fig . 4c ) . Of note , Arg 477 is occluded by layer 2 through a hydrogen bond to Glu 285 . Thus , in the intramolecular fold , this residue , and probably residues surround - ing it in sequence , would be inaccessible to the binding sites of other partners such as the Arp2 / 3 complex . In this way , full - length WASP proteins appear to be autoinhibited , activating Arp2 / 3 only mini - mally compared to isolated VCA peptides 8 , 13 , as a result of seques - tration of the basic motif by the intramolecular fold . Mechanism of activation by Cdc42 Comparison of the autoinhibited and Cdc42 - bound structures of the GBD provides insight into the mechanism by which WASP is activated by GTPases . In both the inter - and intramolecular com - plexes , sequences immediately after the CRIB motif ( Val 251 – Lys 288 ) form a similar two - stranded b - sheet and a - helix ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Backbone f and w angles throughout this region are virtually identical for all residues in both structures , with the exception of Val 260 and Asn 262 . These lie in the a region of f / w space in the autoinhibited fold , creating the turn that terminates the b 2 strand of the GBD , but in the b - region in the Cdc42 complex . Thus , Cdc42 binding eliminates the turn , extracting the Val 260 side chain from Thr 280 and Leu 281 in the core of the domain and placing it against the WASP b 1 strand . There , Val 260 contacts Val 250 , extending the WASP b - strands in the Cdc42 complex to include Val 250 – Asp 253 and Gly 257 – Val 260 ( Figs 1 , 4b , 5a , c ) . The additional hydrogen bonds formed in this restructuring may internally stabilize the WASP peptide , providing some of the driving force for Cdc42 binding . Interactions between the strands may also be strengthened in the complex by sheet - like contacts of b 1 with Cdc42 , in accord with model peptide studies showing cooperative stabilization of three - stranded b - sheets as opposed to b - hairpins 17 . The extension of b 2 also causes a large change in the relative orientations of the WASP sheet and the a 1 helix . In the autoinhib - ited structure , the helix is roughly perpendicular to the long axis of the sheet , and makes a 135 8 angle with the short axis ( Figs 4c , 5d ) . Wedged between these two elements are the b / a 1 loop and the a 2 helix . In the Cdc42 complex , this wedge is removed and the a 1 helix pivoted such that it is nearly parallel to the long axis of the sheet and packs against one face ( Figs 4b , 5c ) . This conforma - tional compaction , manifested by numerous intra - WASP NOEs , decreases the surface area buried by the layer 1 b / a 1 sequences from 2 , 180 6 70 A˚ 2 in the autoinhibited structure because of packing against layers 2 and 3 ( Fig . 5b ) to 980 6 50 A˚ 2 in the complex from packing against switches I and II of Cdc42 ( Fig . 5a ) . The decrease in buried surface in the Cdc42 interface is , however , somewhat compensated by an increase in surface buried within layer 1 between the b - sheet and a 1 helix . Notably , virtually all atoms buried in the Cdc42 complex ( including those of residues Val 250 , Gly 251 , Trp 252 , Phe 258 , Leu 267 , Leu 270 , Phe 271 , Ala 274 and Ile 276 ) are also buried in the autoinhibited structure and form an integral part of the hydrophobic core ( Fig . 5b ) . Thus , interaction with the GTPase necessitates separation of layer 1 from layer 2 , prying open the hydrophobic core of the autoinhibited GBD fold . This steric incompatibility between the Cdc42 - bound and auto - inhibited folds contributes to the release of the CHR in two ways . First , when a 1 packs against Cdc42 , its presence in the CHR binding site is lost ( see yellow region in Fig . 4d ) . Second , separation of layer 1 from layer 2 removes many contacts in the hydrophobic core that stabilize helices a 2 and a 3 . The resulting destabilization of these secondary elements further ensures disruption of the CHR binding site . Thus , as binding of the CHR to one face of layer 2 leads to cooperative folding of the GBD to the autoinhibited conformation , removal of the b - sheet and a 1 helix from the opposite face by Cdc42 leads to cooperative unfolding of the domain and release of the articles NATURE | VOL 404 | 9 MARCH 2000 | www . nature . com 155 Figure 5 Steric incompatibility of the autoinhibited and activated structures . a , Surface of GBD1 that contacts Cdc42 ( d C – C , 4 . 5 A˚ ) in the GTPase complex .

The high sequence identity and biochemical similarities between WASP and N - WASP indicate that this mechanism repre - sents the common structural process by which Cdc42 activates these proteins to stimulate the Arp2 / 3 complex . Thermodynamics of activation Our model predicts that Cdc42 should have greater afﬁnity for unfolded WASP constructs than for folded constructs because of the thermodynamic penalty of disrupting the autoinhibited structure of the GBD . To test this prediction , we measured the afﬁnity of a series of GBD constructs for Cdc42 under several conditions using a ﬂuorescence binding assay 9 . In aqueous buffer , GBD1 and GBD2 bind Cdc42 with comparable afﬁnities of 110 6 7 and 133 6 9 nM , respectively . As predicted , constructs encompassing both the full CRIB - containing GBD and the full VCA region ( FL7 , residues 230 – 502 ; FL8 , residues 230 – 310 and 420 – 502 linked by ( GGS ) 2 ) show afﬁnities weaker by 83 - and 300 - fold ( 11 . 0 6 0 . 7 and 39 . 7 6 2 . 4 m M ) , respectively , corresponding to 2 . 6 and 3 . 4 kcal mol - 1 penalties , probably due to unfolding of the autoinhibited structure upon Cdc42 binding . We obtained similar results for GBD con - structs that were folded by the addition of TFE , further supporting our structural model of disruption of the autoinhibited fold upon binding to Cdc42 . Regulation of the GBD – VCA interaction in vivo In addition to Cdc42 , other mechanisms may also modulate the intramolecular contacts in WASP and N - WASP in vivo , integrating multiple signalling pathways in control of the cytoskeleton . For example , WASP is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to collagen stimulation of platelets 18 , B - cell receptor activation in B cells 19 and IgE receptor activation in mast cells 20 . A substrate for both Lyn , a Src - family kinase , and Btk , a member of the Tec family , WASP is phosphorylated in a Cdc42 - dependent fashion 20 at Tyr 291 ( mapped for Btk ) 19 . This tyrosine lies in the a 3 helix of the autoinhibited structure and is largely buried by a p - stacking interaction with Trp 252 in the b - hairpin ( Fig . 4c ) . Disruption of the a 3 – hairpin contacts upon Cdc42 binding would greatly increase accessibility of Tyr 291 to kinases , and might explain the potentiat - ing effect of the GTPase on Lyn - mediated phosphorylation . More - over , phosphorylation of Tyr 291 could destabilize the autoinhibited fold , acting to extend the lifetime of the WASP signal in a GTPase - independent manner . This could occur through either direct destabilization of a 3 – hairpin contacts , or by creating a docking site for SH2 domains , whose binding would be incompatible with the helical conformation of a 3 . Finally , destabilization of the GBD by phosphorylation could affect the rate of WASP turnover , again changing the time course of the actin polymerization signal . Both SH3 - domain - containing proteins , such as Grb2 ( M . - F . Carlier , personal communication ) , and the lipid second messenger PIP 2 ( ref . 8 ) synergize with Cdc42 to enhance stimulation of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization by N - WASP . The biochemical mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown , but may involve modulation of the autoinhibited fold . Because the polyproline region of WASP lies between the GBD and VCA sequences , SH3 - containing adapter proteins that bind to this region could regulate the equilibrium between the open ( activated ) and closed ( auto - inhibited ) forms of WASP . Likewise , PIP 2 might act through another type of conformation toggle , affecting the sequestration or structure of the VCA region . The NMR data and methods described above will provide a powerful means of addressing these issues in the future . WASP in disease A large database now exists of WASP mutations that cause classical WAS or XLT , a milder form of the disease limited to platelet abnormalities 4 . A number of missense mutations can now be examined in the context of the activated and autoinhibited WASP structures ( Fig . 4c ) . Two of these are in the GBD : M307V ( ref . 21 ) and A236G ( ref . 22 ) . Methionine 307 is located in the a 4 helix , where it packs against a 1 . Its mutation appears to destabilize the autoinhibited structure ( A . S . K . , unpublished data ) , leading to improper WASP activation or perhaps enhanced proteolytic turnover 23 in vivo . On the other hand , Ala 236 is located near the N terminus of the CRIB motif , and in the Cdc42 complex structure it is positioned over the C - terminal helix of the GTPase 6 . Its mutation may directly impact the WASP – Cdc42 interaction , thereby affecting the efﬁciency of WASP activation by the GTPase . Two disease - causing mutations within the VCA region , R477K ( ref . 24 ) and K476E ( ref . 25 ) , have also been identiﬁed ( Fig . 4c ) . Both altered residues lie within the conserved basic motif of the CHR . Although mutation of Arg 477 might be expected to change its interaction with Glu 285 ( see above ) , Lys 476 extends from the solvent - exposed surface of the autoinhibited structure and does not directly make intramolecular contacts . Notably , introduction of each mutation individually into GBD4 – C does not change the melting temperature of the construct measured by CD or the 1 H / 15 N - HSQC dispersion pattern ( not shown ) , suggesting that neither affects the stability of the autoinhibited fold . Thus , it is likely that the mutations affect interaction of the coﬁlin helix with another partner . Indeed , residues 476 and 477 are deleted in the D cof mutant which fails to bind the Arp2 / 3 complex 8 , suggesting that their alteration might affect WASP interactions with this assembly . Further biochemical analyses of these various mutant proteins , interpreted in light of the activated and autoinhibited structures , will provide additional insights into the molecular basis of the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome . Generalities of WASP in signal transduction The activation of WASP has many parallels to that of other Ras superfamily effectors , including the kinase Raf , a target of Ras , and the kinase PAK , a Cdc42 / Rac target .

Such changes are mediated by ﬂanking sequences ( the cysteine - rich domain of Raf 27 , and segments C - terminal to the CRIB motif in WASP and PAK 28 ) , whose interactions with the GTPase relieve autoinhibitory contacts toactivity - bearingregionsoftheeffectors . Inallcases , thenon - covalent interactions with the GTPase potentiate homologous ( PAK 29 ) or heterologous ( WASP 18 – 20 and Raf 30 ) phosphorylation events that appear to lead to permanent enhancement of activity . These parallels suggest a common theme of GTPase effector regulation involving the steps of autoinhibition , transient allosteric activation , and covalent modiﬁcation that extends the time period of activation . The ability of effectors to respond to both transient and permanent activation signals allows them to integrate information from multiple sources , and produce different responses depending on the relative strength , timing , duration and localization of the inputs . In addition , the requirement for conformational change to affect release of autoinhibition suggests a common theme of protein plasticity in signal transduction . The structures described here identify a single polypeptide chain , the WASP GBD , that can adopt related but distinct folds depending on context ( Fig . 4a – c ) . The structures have similar layer 1 secondary elements which are , however , uniquely packed and oriented when induced by Cdc42 , TFE or the VCA region ( compare Fig . 5c and d ) . Adjacent regions , including the CRIB motif and layer 2 , are likewise structurally distinct in the different states . It is probable that this extreme plasticity of the GBD is related to its absence of discrete tertiary structure in isolation . Numerous examples have appeared recently in the literature where unfolded , yet fully functional , proteins or protein domains are induced to discrete structure on binding their targets 31 , 32 . This coupling of folding and binding may affect ligand speciﬁcity , regulation , transport and in vivo turnover 31 , 32 . Implicit in many functional arguments is the notion that the absence of a single thermodynamic minimum may enable such ‘intrinsically unstruc - tured’ chains to adopt different minima , characterized by different three - dimensional structures , when bound to different targets or under different conditions 31 , 32 . While it remains an open issue whether intrinsically unstructured domains / proteins truly exist in a free , unfolded state in the cell , it is likely that in vivo the WASP GBD alternates between the various induced structures discovered here in the context of different binding partners . In either case , the ability of a polypeptide to adopt functionally distinct structures in different environments , which themselves may be controlled by additional cellular inputs , could provide a novel means of regulating information transfer in signaling pathways in vivo . The unique biophysical properties of the WASP GBD , coupled with the complex yet dissectable activation process of the protein , make WASP an ideal system for examination of the fundamental physical and biological principles underlying signal transduction in the cell . M Methods Sample preparation Most constructs were ampliﬁed fromthe full - length WASP complementary DNAbyPCR and subcloned into either pET11a ( GBD1 – 4 ) , pET16b ( FL7 ) or pGEX - 2T ( VCA constructs ) expression vectors . Proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) and puriﬁed from bacterial lysate by either conventional chromatography ( GBD1 – 4 ) or by afﬁnity chromatography on Ni - NTA resin ( FL7 ) or glutathione sepharose ( VCA constructs ) . Isolated VCA proteins were obtained from the GST fusions by cleavage with thrombin and puriﬁcation by gel - ﬁltration chromatography . GBD4 – C and FL8 were constructed by a three - step process in which two separate fragments of the WASP cDNAwere ampliﬁed by PCR with insertion of a complementary sequence encoding the ( Gly - Gly - Ser ) 2 linker , followed by PCR ampliﬁcation of a mixture of those templates . The constructs were subcloned into the pET11a expression vector then overexpressed and puriﬁed as above for the GBD proteins . Uniform 15 N and 13 C labelling was achieved by growing bacteria in minimal media supplemented with 15 NH 4 Cl and / or 13 C 6 - glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources , respectively . Fluorescence spectroscopy Fluorescence studies on the VCA constructs were conducted on a Perkin Elmer LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer at 25 8 C using a 10 - mm rectangular quartz cuvette . The cell was charged with 1 m M of either GBD3 or GBD4 and titrated with puriﬁed thrombin - cleaved VCA peptides .

Binding assays GST – VCA fusion constructs were immobilized on glutathione S - sepharose beads and incubated with GBD protein ( 3 - fold molar excess ) for 2 h at 4 8 C . After sedimentation by centrifugation , the beads were washed with buffer and analysed , in parallel with super - natant , by SDS – PAGE . Alternatively , after washing the beads were treated with either GDP - or GMPPNP - loaded Cdc42 ( 10 - fold molar excess over GBD ) . The beads and supernatant were then analysed separately by SDS – PAGE . Circular dichroism Circulardichroismspectrawere acquired from10 m M protein solutions using aJasco710 spectrometer .

Melting temperature was determined from the ﬁrst derivative of the unfolding curve . Identity of the heating and cooling curves indicated reversible unfolding . NMR spectroscopy NMR experiments were carried out at 25 8 C on Varian Inova 500 or 600 MHz spectro - meters equipped with four channels and pulsed ﬁeld gradients . Samples contained 1 – 2mM protein in 50mM phosphate buffer ( 90 % H 2 O / 10 % D 2 O or 100 % D 2 O ) pH6 . 8 ( uncorrected ) and 100mM NaCl .
