Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 110379 Summary The a 7 acetylcholine nicotinic receptor ( a 7 ) is an important mediator of cholinergic transmission during brain development . Here we present an intracellular signaling mechanism for the a 7 receptor . Proteomic analysis of immunoprecipitated a 7 subunits reveals an interaction with a G protein pathway complex ( GPC ) comprising G a i / o , GAP - 43 and G protein regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1 ( Gprin1 ) in differentiating cells . Morphological studies indicate that a 7 receptors regulate neurite length and complexity via a Gprin1 - dependent mechanism that directs the expression of a 7 to the cell surface . a 7 – GPC interactions were confirmed in embryonic cortical neurons and were found to modulate the growth of axons . Taken together , these findings reveal a novel intracellular pathway of signaling for a 7 within neurons , and suggest a role for its interactions with the GPC in brain development . Key words : Gprin , Axon growth , Proteomics , GAP - 43 , Cytoskeleton , Nicotine , Neurite , Bungarotoxin , Growth cone Introduction Neuronal development is marked by important phases in growth involving structural remodeling of the soma and an outgrowth of neurites culminating in the formation of functional axons and dendrites ( Mortimer et al . , 2008 ; Petros et al . , 2008 ) . Various neurotransmitter receptors are known to contribute to neuronal development ( van Kesteren and Spencer , 2003 ; Mattson , 2008 ) . Receptor mediated signal transduction appears crucial in regulating the assembly , disassembly , and reorganization of the cytoskeleton during growth ( Stiess and Bradke , 2011 ) . Signaling via the second messenger family of heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins ( G proteins ) is one mechanism for structural remodeling during neuronal development ( Flavell and Greenberg , 2008 ) . Inhibitory G proteins such as G a i / o are enriched in developmental structures such as axonal growth cones during neurite navigation ( Bromberg et al . , 2008 ) . In addition to being activated by membrane spanning G protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , G a i / o can be activated by intracellular calcium ( Strittmatter et al . , 1991 ; Yang et al . , 2009 ) . Calcium signaling is important during cellular development where it has been shown to play a role in the growth and navigation of newly formed neurites ( Henley et al . , 2004 ) . Calcium - conducting ligand - gated ion channels , such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) , are abundant during nervous system development and have been found to modulate the growth of neurons in the hippocampus and cortex ( Zheng et al . , 1994 ; Aramakis and Metherate , 1998 ) . In differentiated neurons , nAChRs contribute to structural remodeling within presynaptic terminals and dendritic spines ( Berg and Conroy , 2002 ) . To date , 11 different nAChR subunits have been found in the mammalian brain ( a 2 – a 9 and b 2 – b 4 ) ( Albuquerque et al . , 2009 ; Changeux , 2010 ) . The a - bungarotoxin ( Bgtx ) sensitive a 7 receptor is homopentameric and conducts mainly calcium upon activation ( Dani and Bertrand , 2007 ) . Previous studies indicate a role for a 7 receptors in the growth of neurons and the formation of synapses ( Coronas et al . , 2000 ; Berg et al . , 2006 ) . Deactivation of a 7 by ligands such as Bgtx as well as endogenous transmitters such as kynurenic acid ( KYNA ) has been found to impact neuronal growth ( Stone and Darlington , 2002 ; Ru¨diger and Bolz , 2008 ) . To investigate the mechanisms by which a 7 regulates neuronal development , we have determined the signaling properties of a 7 receptors within differentiating neural cells . We present evidence on the existence of a G protein pathway complex ( GPC ) , consisting of G a i / o , growth associated protein 43 ( GAP - 43 ) , and G protein regulated inducer of neurite growth 1 ( Gprin1 ) , that directly associates with a 7 in pheochromocytoma line 12 ( PC12 ) cells and cortical neurons . a 7 – GPC interactions appear to modulate neurite and axonal development . Results a 7 receptors mediate neurite growth a 7 receptors have been shown to affect neurite growth and synaptic development in neurons ( Chan and Quik , 1993 ; Ru¨diger and Bolz , 2008 ) . To determine the role of a 7 in neurite development we morphologically analyzed cells for growth using the Neuromantic software . In this study , cells with at least one process longer than the cell body were analyzed . We chronically treated PC12 cells with the a 7 specific antagonist Bgtx , the nAChR agonist nicotine ( Nic ) , the a 7 specific agonist PNU282987 ( PNU ) , or a combination of Bgtx and Nic or PNU during nerve growth factor ( NGF ) differentiation . Since all differentiation experiments were performed in the presence of 5502 Research Article J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e NGF , unless otherwise noted , the term differentiation is from here on synonymous with NGF - differentiation . PNU , Nic , and Bgtx occupy a common binding site on the a 7 receptor ( Pankratov et al . , 2002 ; Grabe et al . , 2012b ; Spitzer et al . , 2012 ) . As shown in Fig . 1A , chronic treatment with Bgtx resulted in a statistically significant increase in neurite surface area ( SA ) ( P , 0 . 001 ) , while Nic and PNU treatments were found to significantly decrease neurite SA ( P , 0 . 05 ) compared to controls . A coapplication of Bgtx with Nic or Bgtx with PNU was found to result in a negligible morphological effect when compared to control cells ( P . 0 . 05 ) suggesting that the two drugs act via a common receptor . Group significance was found between control , Bgtx , Nic and PNU [ F ( 3 , 172 ) 5 4 . 00 , P , 0 . 001 ] . Combination of PNU and Nic did not produce a greater effect on neurite SA than either drug alone ( data not shown ) consistent with the idea that PNU and Nic act via the same binding site ( Pankratov et al . , 2002 ) . We next examined the effects of the endogenous transmitters acetylcholine ( ACh ) and KYNA , which are known to respectively activate or deactivate a 7 . As shown in Fig . 1A , chronic treatment with KYNA or ACh was found to significantly increase ( P , 0 . 001 ) or decrease ( P , 0 . 05 ) neurite SA , respectively [ F ( 2 , 184 ) 5 4 . 00 , P , 0 . 001 ] . These effects of KYNA and ACh on neurite growth appeared comparable to the effects of Bgtx and Nic in the same cell line ( Fig . 1A ) and suggest that prolonged pharmacological perturbations of the a 7 receptor mediates neurite growth within differentiating cells . NGF induced differentiation of PC12 cells is known to promote RNA and protein synthesis , neurite growth , a decrease in cell division , electrical excitability , and render them more responsive to ACh ( Csillik et al . , 2004 ) . We find that NGF promotes at least a twofold increase in neurite growth and branching complexity within PC12 cells ( Fig . 1B ) . We assessed the role of nAChRs in PC12 cells in the absence of NGF . In comparison to NGF differentiated cells , PC12 cells grown in the absence of NGF displayed little or no neurite extension ( Fig . 1B ) . Chronic treatment with ACh , Nic , or PNU was found to have little effect on neurite SA in the absence of NGF ( data not shown ) . In contrast , chronic treatment with Bgtx was found to promote an increase in neurite growth even in the absence of NGF . As shown in Fig . 1B , Bgtx was found to increase neurite SA ( compared to controls ) in both differentiated and non - differentiated cells suggesting that the modulatory effects of Bgtx are not limited to NGF differentiation . The cytoskeletal proteins actin and tubulin drive neurite extension and retraction during cellular growth ( Zhou et al . , 2002 ; Lowery and Van Vactor , 2009 ) . We quantified the levels of a - tubulin and b - actin from lysates of cells chronically treated with Bgtx and Nic . As shown in Fig . 1C , a - tubulin expression was significantly increased in response to Bgtx ( P , 0 . 05 ) while significantly decreased after Nic treatment ( P , 0 . 01 ) in comparison to control cells . In these experiments , the levels of total b - actin in the cell did not appear to be significantly altered between Bgtx ( P 5 0 . 76 ) and Nic ( P 5 0 . 55 ) drug treatment conditions suggesting a role for these drugs on tubulin protein synthesis or stability . Isolation of a 7 interactomes a 7 has been implicated in the growth of neurites ( Berg and Conroy , 2002 ) but the mechanism remains unknown . We tested antibodies ( Abs ) for their ability to detect the a 7 subunit within PC12 cells . As shown in Fig . 2A two Abs directed again the a 7 protein ( mAb 306 and C - 20 ) reacted to a , 57 kDa band within PC12 cell lysate ( Fig . 2A , lane 1 ) . In these experiments , Neuroblastoma 2a ( N2a ) cells were used as a negative control Fig . 1 . a 7 regulates neurite growth in PC12 cells .

As shown in Fig . 2A , a polyclonal anti - a 7 Ab ( C - 20 ) was able to successfully immunoprecipitate ( IP ) the a 7 subunit from PC12 cells and in these IP experiments , two reactive bands were visualized on a western blot immunoprobed with mAb306 ( Fig . 2A ) . Since a 7 receptors can be glycosylated as well as palmitoylated ( Hu et al . , 2007 ) , it is possible that these bands represent post - translational modifications to the a 7 . Receptor - protein interactions mediate the trafficking and signaling of the receptor within the cell ( Kabbani et al . , 2007 ; Kabbani and Levenson , 2007 ; Yamatani et al . , 2010 ) . To determine interactions of a 7 , we utilized MS to define proteins that coIP with the a 7 subunit in PC12 cells . In these experiments protein complexes that bound to the protein G matrix in the absence of the IP Ab were excluded from the results . Liquid Chromatography Electro Spray Ionization ( LC - ESI ) mass spectrometry ( MS ) analysis of IP complexes using mAb306 or C - 20 reveals the presence of an a 7 interaction complex . A list of a 7 interacting proteins and information on their protein score ( PS ) , molecular weight , and NCBI accession number is presented in supplementary material Table S1 . A cohort of a 7 interacting proteins are components of G protein pathways and are known to play a role in neurite development ( supplementary material Table S1 ) . We refer to this group as the GPC . Notably , G a o and Gprin1 have been previously shown to interact with the b 2 subunit of nAChRs in the adult brain ( Kabbani et al . , 2007 ) and have been found to direct growth cone and neurite development ( Chen et al . , 1999 ; Nakata and Kozasa , 2005 ; Masuho et al . , 2008 ) . To validate a 7 – GPC interactions , C - 20 was used in IP experiments from differentiating PC12 cells . Interacting proteins were visualized using western blot . As shown in Fig . 2B , a band immunoreactive for mAb306 was detected at 57 kDa , the expected molecular weight of the a 7 subunit . Since previous studies have shown an interaction between G a i / o and Gprin1 ( Nakata and Kozasa , 2005 ) as well as G a i / o and the guanine exchange factor ( GEF ) GAP - 43 ( Yang et al . , 2009 ) , we examined the presence of Gprin1 , G a i / o and GAP - 43 within the same a 7 complex . The blot shown in Fig . 2B was probed for Gprin1 and then reprobed using an anti - G a i / o Ab and an anti - GAP - 43 Ab . Immunoreactive bands corresponding to Gprin1 , G a i / o , and GAP - 43 were detected within the a 7 complex . a 7 – GPC interaction was also found in non - differentiated PC12 cells at lower abundance ( data not shown ) . To confirm the presence of the a 7 – GPC interactomes C - 20 was used to IP a 7 from crosslinked cellular lysates of differentiated PC12 cells . As shown in Fig . 2C , a multi - protein complex was visualized using a Coomassie stain . Manually excised bands were analyzed using LC - ESI MS analysis . This confirmed the identity of Calmodulin 3 ( CaM3 , 18 kDa ) , G a o ( 41 kDa ) , GAP - 43 ( 43 kDa ) , Gprin1 ( 85 kDa ) , the a 7 subunit ( 57 kDa ) , and GAP - 43 bound to CaM3 ( 61 kDa ) within a common complex . a 7 interactions regulate phosphorylation of GAP - 43 and association with calmodulin G proteins have been shown to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and neurite growth in neurons ( Rashid et al . , 2001 ; Di Giovanni et al . , 2005 ) . In particular G a i / o has been found in regions where cytoskeletal remodeling is high ( Skene , 1989 ; Bromberg et al . , 2008 ; Lowery and Van Vactor , 2009 ) . We examined the effect of a 7 on GPC interactions within PC12 cells . CoIP experiments using C - 20 were performed on differentiated cells treated with Bgtx or Nic for 2 hours . As shown in Fig . 2D , western blot detection of IP a 7 complexes reveals that treatment with Bgtx or Nic has no effect on Gprin1 and CaM levels within the complex . However , since the anti - CaM Ab used does not distinguish between various forms of CaM , changes in specific isoforms of CaM cannot be excluded . A reprobe of the membrane reveals Fig . 2 .

Journal of Cell Science 125 ( 22 ) 5504 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e that Bgtx increases while Nic decreases the presence of G a i / o and GAP - 43 ( Fig . 2D ) within the a 7 complex indicating that pharmacological activation of the receptor impacts its interaction with select GPC proteins . The phosphorylation of GAP - 43 by protein kinase C ( PKC ) ( Esdar et al . , 1999 ) and CaMKII ( Denny , 2006 ; Leu et al . , 2010 ) or dephosphorylation by calcineurin ( PP2B ) ( Liu and Storm , 1989 ; Madsen et al . , 1998 ) has been shown to regulate CaM association and neurite growth . In its unphosphorylated form , GAP - 43 binds CaM leading to an inhibition in neurite growth ( Skene , 1990 ; Slemmon et al . , 1996 ) . In contrast , phosphorylation of GAP - 43 promotes CaM dissociation leading to an increase in neurite growth ( Strittmatter et al . , 1994b ) . An anti - phospho - GAP - 43 Ab ( selective for CaMKII phosphorylation site Serine 41 ) ( Denny , 2006 ) was used to determine the effects of Bgtx and Nic on GAP - 43 . As shown in Fig . 2D , an increase in anti - phospho - GAP - 43 immunoreactivity was observed within the a 7 complex following Bgtx treatment . Similarly , Nic was found to decrease anti - phospho - GAP - 43 immunoreactivity within the a 7 complex . To determine if change in GAP - 43 phosphorylation correlated with CaM binding , we utilized the bis ( sulfosuccinimidyl ) substrate ( BS 3 ) to test the effects of Bgtx and Nic on GAP - 43 / CaM interaction . This method has been used in the detection of GAP - 43 in the CaM bound / free states where the GAP - 43 band runs at , 18 kDa ( the approximate size of CaM ) heavier on an SDS - PAGE gel when bound to CaM ( Gamby et al . , 1996 ) . In these experiments , cell fractions were crosslinked following a 2 - hour treatment with Bgtx , Nic , or a vehicle control . An anti - GAP - 43 Ab was used to visualize two distinct bands within the sample and MS was used to confirm their identity as GAP - 43 [ bound to CaM3 ( 61 kDa ) or alone ( 43 kDa ) ] ( Fig . 2E ) . In control cells , the 43 kDa band presented a stronger signal than the 61 kDa band suggesting that CaM free GAP - 43 is a main form of GAP - 43 within PC12 cells . Densitometric analysis showed that the band at 43 kDa increased during Bgtx treatment and decreased during Nic treatment . In contrast , the band at 61 kDa increased during Nic treatment and decreased following Bgtx ( Fig . 2E ) . In light of the differential associations between a 7 and GAP - 43 under these conditions , and the observed increase in phospho - GAP - 43 reactivity with the a 7 complex in the same cells ( Fig . 2D ) , it is possible that Bgtx promotes interaction between a 7 and non - CaM bound GAP - 43 during growth . a 7 Receptors direct growth through G a i / o and calmodulin G a i / o has been shown to regulate neurite growth ( Strittmatter et al . , 1994a ; Swarzenski et al . , 1996 ) . To examine the role of G a i / o in a 7 signaling , we applied the G a i / o inhibitor Pertussis toxin ( Ptx ) or the G a o activator Mastoparan ( MSP ) during NGF differentiation ( Fig . 3A ) . We tested the involvement of G a i / o in Bgtx mediated neurite growth by exposing cells to both Ptx and Bgtx during the 4 days of NGF differentiation . As shown in Fig . 3B , coapplication of Ptx and Bgtx was found to significantly reduce neurite SA when compared to Bgtx treatment alone ( P , 0 . 01 ) . When applied alone Ptx was found to decrease neurite SA to an average level below control cells ( Fig . 3B ) . Since Nic was found to attenuate neurite growth during differentiation , we examined the ability of MSP to enhance neurite growth . A 4 - day treatment with MSP was found to significantly increase neurite SA ( P , 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 3B ) when compared to controls confirming the role of G a i / o in neurite development . In the presence of Nic , MSP was found to only moderately promote neurite growth when compared to controls ( P 5 0 . 56 ) ( Fig . 3B ) suggesting that MSP and Nic function antagonistically within the cell . Group significance was found between control , Ptx and MSP treatments [ F ( 2 , 135 ) 5 4 . 03 , P , 0 . 001 ] . These studies underscore the role for G a i / o in neurite development and suggest a functional interaction between G a i / o and a 7 in growth . Fig . 3 .

We utilized drugs that block CaM , PP2B , and CaMKII to test the role of these proteins in a 7 mediated neurite growth ( Fig . 3C ) . As shown in Fig . 3D , we exposed cells to the CaM inhibitor calmidazolium ( CMZ ) during NGF differentiation . CMZ has also been shown to have some CaM independent effects including activation of phospholipase 2A and regulation of intracellular Ca 2 + stores ( Duffy et al . , 2011 ) . We find that CMZ produced a significant decrease in neurite SA when compared to controls ( P , 0 . 01 ) , confirming that attenuation of CaM activity reduces neurite growth ( Jian et al . , 1994 ) . To confirm the effects of CMZ on a 7 signaling , we coapplied Bgtx and CMZ during differentiation . As shown in Fig . 3D , this combination was found to block the effects of Bgtx on neurite growth suggesting an important role for CaM in a 7 signaling . To investigate the role of PP2B and CaMKII , we probed the morphological effects of FK506 and KN - 93 , which respectively target these two proteins in cells ( Liu and Berg , 1999 ; Jouvenceau and Dutar , 2006 ) . As shown in Fig . 3E , application of FK506 was found to significantly increase neurite SA ( P , 0 . 001 ) . This effect of FK506 was enhanced in the presence of Bgtx ( P , 0 . 001 ) and diminished in the presence of Nic ( P 5 0 . 87 ) , suggesting that Nic and PP2B operate synergistically to inhibit growth ( Fig . 3E ) . Similarly , application of KN - 93 was found to significantly diminish neurite SA when compared to control cells ( P , 0 . 001 ) , suggesting that CaMKII activity is required for growth ( Fig . 3E ) . Group significance was found between control , FK506 , KN - 93 , and CMZ [ F ( 3 , 179 ) 5 3 . 36 , P , 0 . 001 ] . When combined with Bgtx , KN - 93 was found to block the effects of Bgtx on neurite SA ( Fig . 3E ) ( P . 0 . 05 ) . These findings suggest that CaMKII operates downstream of a 7 receptors in PC12 cells and is required for Bgtx mediated neurite growth . Finally , to confirm that PP2B and CaMKII operate within a common pathway ( Fig . 3C ) , we coapplied KN - 93 and FK506 . This combination did not produce a significant change in neurite SA when compared to controls ( Fig . 3E ) , suggesting that PP2B and CaMKII act antagonistically . Gprin1 promotes a 7 nAChR signaling and neurite growth The G a i / o interactor Gprin1 has been shown to regulate neurite growth in cells ( Masuho et al . , 2008 ; Ge et al . , 2009 ) . We examined interactions between a 7 and Gprin1 in differentiating PC12 cells . Using a western blot we confirmed the ability of an anti - Gprin1 Ab to IP Gprin1 as well as a 7 from cells ( Fig . 4A ) . a 7 / Gprin1 interactions were further validated by heterologous protein expression studies in N2a cells , which do not express a 7 ( Danthi and Boyd , 2006 ) . In these experiments we transiently transfected 1 – 10 m g of a 7 cDNA ( per 10 cm Petri dish of N2a cells ) and tested for interaction with endogenous Gprin1 24 hrs later . As shown in Fig . 4B , a 7 proteins were successfully detected in N2a cells after transfection . An IP of the a 7 subunit from N2a cells reveal its association with endogenous Gprin1 . A reverse IP of Gprin1 from N2a cells was also found to maintain an association with transfected a 7 subunits ( Fig . 4B ) . We used a genetic knockdown strategy to test if Gprin1 mediates a 7 / GPC interaction . In these experiments , differentiating PC12 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Gprin1 short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) ( Gprin1 siRNA ) ( Ge et al . , 2009 ) . Western blot detection of Gprin1 within transfected cells reveals that Gprin1 siRNA reduces Gprin1 levels Fig . 4 . a 7 / Gprin1 association within differentiating cells .

Insets : magnifications of soma ( 1 ) , neurite ( 2 ) , and a neurite terminal ( 3 ) . Journal of Cell Science 125 ( 22 ) 5506 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e by 85 % within cells ( Fig . 6A ) . An IP of a 7 was performed using C - 20 . As shown in Fig . 4C , in cells transfected with Gprin1 siRNA , a 7 interactions with Gprin1 , G a i / o and GAP - 43 appeared lower than control cells transfected with the empty vector . These findings suggest that Gprin1 expression plays a role in GPC interaction with a 7 . To test this , LC - ESI MS was used to analyze proteins that coIP with Gprin1 from PC12 cells . As shown in Fig . 4D , at least six discrete bands were visualized by a Coomassie stain of an SDS - PAGE gel loaded with proteins eluted from an anti - Gprin1 IP experiment . Based on MS identification , Gprin1 , a 7 , CaM3 , G a i / o and GAP - 43 were successfully detected within the Gprin1 IP experiment from PC12 cells , confirming Gprin1 interactions with a 7 and GPC molecules . We used fluorescein - conjugated Bgtx ( fBgtx ) and anti - Gprin1 Abs to colocalize endogenous a 7 and Gprin1 within differentiating cells , respectively . As shown in Fig . 4E , F , a 7 and Gprin1 proteins were found to colocalize within soma and growing neurites of differentiating PC12 cells . At 2 days of differentiation , Gprin1 / a 7 colocalization appeared prominent in the cytoplasm and near the cell surface and was seen uniformly distributed along the growing neurite and within the neurite terminal , which also stained positive for the growth cone marker 2G13 ( Fig . 4E ) . At 4 days of differentiation , Gprin1 / a 7 colocalization was seen near the plasma membrane of the soma and in the growing neurites . However at this later stage of development , colocalization along the growing neurites appeared more punctuate and localized ( Fig . 4F , boxes 2 , 3 ) . Nicotine and Bgtx regulate a 7 and Gprin1 levels at the plasma membrane Nic has been found to differentially regulate the expression of nAChRs in cells ( De Koninck and Cooper , 1995 ; Vallejo et al . , 2005 ; Perry et al . , 2007 ) . We examined the effects of Bgtx and Nic on a 7 expression and membrane localization within PC12 cells . Cells were chronically treated with Bgtx , Nic , or a combination of Bgtx and Nic during NGF differentiation . Cell surface biotinylation was then used to quantify protein expression at the plasma membrane . As shown in Fig . 5A , treatment with Bgtx was found to significantly increase ( P , 0 . 001 ) while treatment with Nic was found to significantly decrease a 7 expression at the plasma membrane ( P , 0 . 05 ) . Neither of the two drugs was found to have an effect on the expression of a 4 subunits at the cell surface ( Fig . 5A ) . A coapplication of Bgtx and Nic was found to have no effect on a 7 expression at the cell surface relative to control cells ( P 5 0 . 42 ) . Because a 7 interacts with Gprin1 , we tested the effects of the drugs on Gprin1 levels at the plasma membrane . Western blot analysis of biotinylated proteins reveals that cell surface Gprin1 amounts are increased following Bgtx treatment ( P , 0 . 001 ) and decreased following Nic treatment ( P , 0 . 05 ) , consistent with data on a 7 levels at the membrane ( Fig . 5A ) . These findings corroborate findings in Fig . 2D on constitutive interactions between Gprin1 and a 7 . Confocal imaging was used to determine the effects of Bgtx and Nic / PNU on a 7 and Gprin1 distribution . Distribution levels were determined using an assay where nine equidistant points Fig . 5 .

Individual fluorescence signals for Gprin1 and fBgtx were significantly increased at the cell surface in cells chronically treated with Bgtx relative to controls . In contrast , fluorescence signals appeared weaker at the cell surface of cells chronically treated with Nic / PNU relative to controls ( Fig . 5B – D ; data not shown ) . Statistical significance was established between control , Bgtx , and Nic / PNU treatment groups : a 7 [ F ( 3 , 312 ) 5 3 . 32 , P , 0 . 001 ] and Gprin1 [ F ( 3 , 320 ) 5 3 . 32 , P , 0 . 001 ] . In cells that received a combination of Bgtx and Nic / PNU , the signal for fBgtx and Gprin1 did not significantly differ from controls ( Fig . 5B – D ) , confirming the opposing effect of these drugs on a 7 / Gprin1 levels at the plasma membrane . Gprin1 expression regulates neurite growth We utilized a genetic strategy to examine the role of Gprin1 on neurite growth in PC12 cells . In these experiments , cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding full length Gprin1 in pcDNA3 . 1 ( Gprin1 pcDNA ) or Gprin1 siRNA ( Ge et al . , 2009 ) prior to differentiation . Transfected cells were then differentiated using NGF in the presence of Bgtx or Nic . Western blot detection of Gprin1 within transfected cells reveals that Gprin1 pcDNA increases total Gprin1 expression by 98 % whereas Gprin1 siRNA decreases Gprin1 levels by 85 % within cells ( Fig . 6A ) . Total a 7 levels were also increased in cells transfected with Gprin1 pcDNA and modestly decreased in cells transfected with Gprin1 siRNA ( Fig . 6A ) . We did not observe a significant difference in Gprin1 protein expression between cells transfected with Gprin1 siRNA1 and Gprin1 siRNA3 ( Fig . 6A ) . Cell surface biotinylation was used to determine the effects of Gprin1 pcDNA and Gprin1 siRNA on a 7 and Gprin1 levels at the plasma membrane . As shown in Fig . 6B , Gprin1 pcDNA was found to significantly increase while Gprin1 siRNA1 / 3 was found to significantly decrease a 7 and Gprin1 levels at the cell surface . In these experiments , transfection of the empty vector did not alter the expression or the localization of a 7 and Gprin1 within the cell ( Fig . 6 , control lanes ) . Cellular imaging and morphometric analysis of cells expressing Gprin1 pcDNA and Gprin1 siRNA3 reveals a dominant role for Gprin1 on a 7 mediated neurite growth . As shown in Fig . 6C , D , transfection with Gprin1 pcDNA was found to significantly increase neurite SA ( P , 0 . 001 ) while transfection with Gprin1 siRNA3 was found to significantly decrease neurite SA ( P , 0 . 05 ) in differentiated PC12 cells relative to controls . To examine the effects of Gprin1 on a 7 mediated growth , we chronically treated cells with Bgtx , Nic , or PNU and compared their effect between cells transfected with Gprin1 pcDNA , Gprin1 siRNA3 , or an empty vector control . As shown in Fig . 6C , D , Gprin1 siRNA3 was found to abolish the effect of Bgtx while Gprin1 pcDNA was found to abolish the effect of Nic / PNU on neurite growth suggesting that Gprin1 expression at the cell surface is a main determinant of neurite growth and drug effect within these cells . a 7 Receptors interact with GPC and modulate axonal growth in cortical neurons We tested the properties of Nic and Bgtx as well as ACh and KYNA on neurite development in primary cortical neurons .

Journal of Cell Science 125 ( 22 ) 5508 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e agonists ( Nic / PNU / ACh ) was found to significantly decrease axonal SA ( P , 0 . 05 ) while chronic treatment with a 7 antagonists ( Bgtx / KYNA ) was found to significantly increase axonal growth and complexity of axons ( P , 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 7A , B ) . Group significance was found between control , Bgtx , Nic , PNU , KYNA , and ACh [ F ( 5 , 162 ) 5 2 . 77 , P , 0 . 001 ] . Combining agonists and antagonists did not alter axonal growth relative to controls neurons ( Bgtx and Nic , P 5 0 . 40 ; Bgtx and PNU , P 5 0 . 23 ; KYNA and ACh , P 5 0 . 79 ) , and none of the drugs appeared to have a statistically significant effect on dendritic growth ( data not shown ) . Association between a 7 and GPC proteins was confirmed in cortical neurons . As shown in Fig . 7C , a C - 20 IP of the a 7 subunit from cortical cells reveals the presence of Gprin1 , G a i / o , and GAP - 43 in association with a 7 nAChRs . Interaction with Gprin1 was further validated using an anti - Gprin1 Ab that was able to coIP Gprin1 as well as a 7 from the same neuronal lysates ( Fig . 7C ) . Interaction between a 7 and Gprin1 is likely to play an important role in axonal development as suggested by triple labeling fluorescence using fBgtx , anti - Gprin1 , and phalloidin . As shown in Fig . 7D , colocalization of a 7 and Gprin1 was seen in growing axons and within growth cones of cortical neurons suggesting a role for these proteins in axonal growth and guidance . Discussion To delineate mechanisms of a 7 receptor function during development , we have used proteomics to define intracellular interactions of the a 7 receptor within growing cells . PC12 cells have proven useful in studies of neuronal development since they endogenously express many neurotransmitter receptors ( Connolly et al . , 1979 ; Sarma et al . , 2003 ) . Once differentiated with NGF , PC12 cells extend elaborate neurites with the properties of growing axons ( Drubin et al . , 1985 ; Lee et al . , 1998 ) . We find that Bgtx and KYNA promote neurite growth in PC12 cells while enhancing axonal length and complexity in primary cortical neurons . ACh / Nic / PNU in contrast are found to attenuate neurite and axonal growth in PC12 cells and cortical neurons , respectively . It is noteworthy , that none of the drug treatment conditions appeared to significantly alter the percentage of cells with at least one process longer than the cell body ( an inclusion criteria in the analysis ) thus confirming that a 7 receptor activity is associated with changes in neurite growth within differentiating cells . Our findings are consistent with earlier observations on the inhibitory effects of ACh on neurite development ( Hieber et al . , 1992 ; Lauder and Schambra , 1999 ) and suggest a role for a 7 in structural and synaptic development ( Corriveau et al . , 1995 ; Romano et al . , 1997 ) . However , since nicotine and ACh activate other cholinergic receptors , the contribution of non - a 7 receptors to neurite growth cannot be excluded . Likewise , the observed effects of KYNA on neurite and axonal growth ( Figs 1 , 7 ) complement data obtained from Bgtx treatment , and suggest that a 7 inactivation plays a role in cellular function . Since KYNA is found to inactivate a 7 and NMDA receptors ( Pereira et al . , 2002 ; Stone and Darlington , Fig . 7 . Interactions of a 7 and GPC in cortical neurons modulate axonal growth . Cortical neurons were cultured for 4 days in the presence of drugs . ( A ) An analysis of axonal SA in cortical neurons following chronic drug treatment .

Insets : magnification of the axon ( 1 ) and the growth cone ( 2 ) . a 7 - nAChR – GPC in neurite growth 5509 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 2002 ; Alkondon et al . , 2007 ) , it is possible KYNA contributes to synaptic development via its actions on these synaptic receptors ( Lin et al . , 2010 ) . Long - term cellular adaptations in neurotransmission include changes in receptor synthesis , turnover , and trafficking to and from the plasma membrane ( Spitzer , 2012 ) . To date little is known about the processes that direct nAChR synthesis and trafficking within growing cells . Studies have shown an effect of chronic Nic on the expression and composition of several nAChRs in various cell types ( De Koninck and Cooper , 1995 ; Perry et al . , 2007 ) . Our data shows that chronic Nic decreases a 7 while chronic Bgtx increases a 7 expression at the cell surface in differentiating PC12 cells . Whether such drug - induced changes in receptor expression at the membrane correlate with changes in receptor activity such as desensitization or structural conformation is not clear . However , changes in a 7 receptor levels at the membrane are found to shift downstream signaling via a Gprin1 / GPC pathway producing important effects on neurite growth . Gprin1 scaffolds a 7 / GPC signaling during growth The G a i / o interactor Gprin1 has been shown to localize to subcellular domains where cytoskeletal remodeling demands are high ( Chen et al . , 1999 ; Ge et al . , 2009 ) . Gprin1 association with the plasma membrane appears dependent on palmitoylation of cysteine residues within the G protein - binding site ( Nakata and Kozasa , 2005 ) . This along with its established role as a mediator of cytoskeletal regulating G proteins such as Cdc42 and Rac ( Nakata and Kozasa , 2005 ; Masuho et al . , 2008 ) suggests that Gprin1 is vital in neurite growth . We demonstrate an interaction between a 7 and Gprin1 in growing cells and propose that this interaction links a 7 to a GPC signaling apparatus as supported by the following key observations : ( i ) the ability of an anti - Gprin1 Ab to coIP a 7 and GPC proteins from neurons and differentiating cells ; ( ii ) colocalization of a 7 and Gprin1 within growing neurites , axons , and growth cones ; ( iii ) the ability of Gprin1 siRNA to decrease a 7 expression at the cell surface or within the cell , reverse the effect of Bgtx on neurite growth , and attenuate interaction between a 7 and GPC proteins . These findings confirm an important role for Gprin1 in scaffolding a 7 receptors at the cell surface as shown for opioid receptors ( Ge et al . , 2009 ) and suggest that Gprin1 interactions facilitate the effects of a 7 on growth . In addition , it is interesting to consider that Gprin1 interacts with b 2 nAChRs ( Kabbani et al . , 2007 ) also present in PC12 cells , which may explain why changes in a 7 expression at the cell surface are not entirely consistent with changes in Gprin1 levels at the cell surface following nicotine treatment ( Fig . 5 ) . The existence of an a 7 – GPC network supports findings on associations between nAChRs and G protein signaling in cells ( Kabbani et al . , 2007 ; Paulo et al . , 2009 ) . Based on the current study we present a model for a 7 signaling via the GPC during neurite development ( Fig . 8 ) . In this model we propose that ligand - induced changes in a 7 levels ( or conformation ) at the cell surface direct GPC signaling towards inhibiting or promoting neurite growth . As shown in Fig . 8 , drug - induced changes in receptor levels at the cell surface appear to accompany an overall effect on protein synthesis associated with growth . In one scenario , a decrease in a 7 at the plasma membrane is found to promote inhibition of GPC function via the calcium sensitive phosphatase PP2B that is activated under conditions of low calcium levels ( Stefan et al . , 2008 ) . As depicted in Pathway A , PP2B dephosphorylation of its target protein GAP - 43 functions as an inhibitory switch for G a i / o within the GPC pathway ( Strittmatter et al . , 1994b ) and mediates interaction with CaM ( Skene , 1990 ; Slemmon et al . , 1996 ) . This pathway is consistent with the finding that chronic Nic promotes enhanced GAP - 43 / CaM association and that a PP2B inhibitor ( FK506 ) effectively blocks Nic induced neurite changes in PC12 cells . In a second scenario , an increase in a 7 levels at the plasma membrane appears to promote the GPC via CaMKII , which is activated under cellular conditions of higher calcium than PP2B ( Wen et al . , 2004 ) . The contributions of CaMKII to this pathway , however , are supported by the ability of a CaMKII inhibitor to block Bgtx mediated neurite growth , because other calcium sensitive kinases such as PKC , also identified in our proteomic screen , can contribute to neurite growth in this scenario . As illustrated in Pathway B , CaMKII phosphorylation of its target protein GAP - 43 functions as an activator of G a i / o signaling within the cell . CaMKII phosphorylation of GAP - 43 has also been shown to promote its dissociation from CaM ( Denny , 2006 ; Leu et al . , 2010 ) , a finding consistent with our crosslinking experiments showing an effect of Bgtx on GAP - 43 / CaM dissociation within the cell ( Fig . 2 ) . This pathway is consistent with the effect of chronic Bgtx treatment on GAP - 43 phosphorylation , or possibly the affinity of the a 7 nAChR complex for phospho - GAP - 43 interaction , as well as proteomic evidence showing that Bgtx mediates dissociation of GAP - 43 and CaM within differentiating cells . The proposed model explores the function of a novel GPC signaling pathway downstream of a 7 nAChRs and alludes to the contributions of localized calcium signaling on the a 7 / GPC network . As suggested in Fig . 8 , changes in calcium levels , from various sources including the a 7 receptor may provide a trigger for the activity of high or low affinity calcium sensors such as PP2B or CaMKII , respectively . However calcium sources and Fig . 8 . A model for a 7 – GPC interactions in neurite growth . Exposure to agonist or antagonist is associated with changes in a 7 / Gprin1 levels at the plasma membrane . Pathway A : A decrease in a 7 / Gprin1 levels at the cell surface results in GPC inhibition via PP2B and a reduction in cytoskeletal mediated neurite growth . Pathway B : Increased a 7 / Gprin1 levels at the cell surface result in GPC activation via CaMKII and an increase in cytoskeletal mediated neurite growth . Both pathways are likely impacted by Ca 2 + entry from external and internal sources . Journal of Cell Science 125 ( 22 ) 5510 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e targets within the pathway are not yet determined . Data presented in Fig . 3 for example , does not entirely demonstrate that PP2B and CaMKII function exclusively downstream of the a 7 receptor in differentiating PC12 cells . Pharmacological suppression of these molecules appears slightly incomplete or additive in some experiments suggesting a function of two ( or more ) possible pathways in parallel within differentiating PC12 cells . Materials and Methods Cell culture Pheochromocytoma line 12 ( PC12 ) cells were grown on a rat collagen ( 50 m g / mL , Gibco ) matrix in dMEM containing 10 % horse serum , 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( Pen - strep ) antibiotic .
