Innovation intermediaries are the invisible hands to bridge the various gaps between the internal and external technical knowledge of the actors in the network . This study has examined the phenomenon of innovation intermediary in the civil innovation network in the Iranian space industry . The dimensions of this phenomenon have been examined and investigated from the perspective of experts and policymakers . As the first goal , this research has studied the dimensions of the intermediary phenomenon in the Iranian space industry innovation network by using the grounded theory approach—we using the analysis of semi - structured interviews and the collected secondary data . Accordingly , the main dimensions of this phenomenon like as regulating , supporting , empowering , facilitating , combining , and producing new knowledge through networking ; using existing infrastructure ; supporting the diversity of actors at the industry level , diversifying private sector actors in the industry , and supporting the evolution of the network from are the perspective of space industry experts in Iran . The second purpose of the present study is to evaluate the actors ' intermediary activities in the Iranian space industry innovation network in terms of a positive impact on the development of the space industry innovation network . Based on the research findings , three policy solutions for the development and evolution of the innovation network in the space industry in Iran are presented : Planning and policy - making to eliminate conflicts of views at the policy - making level , Stabilize the nature of policymakers , the space operator acts as a facilitator leader at the network level between the upstream and downstream space industry . Keywords — Innovation intermediary , Space industry , industry evolution , innovation network , Grounded Theory I . INTRODUCTION In each industry , actors develop co - innovation using networking strategies to acquire external know - how and technology [ 1 ] . It reduces external uncertainty , acquires internal knowledge of other firms through collaborative innovation , decreases R & D costs , and improves innovation performance [ 2 ] . Collaborating with external actors will increase innovativeness [ 3 ] , strengthen the firm ' s knowledge basis , and reduce product launch time [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] . In a network , actors alone cannot innovate and need a variety of collaborations to access innovation . Exchanging know - how with other actors is not easily possible and has several problems in determining the mechanism and how to exchange know - how [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] . When the variety and volume of demand for innovation increase , the firm alone cannot carry out the innovation process and requires a higher level of collaboration . As a result , the phenomenon of innovation intermediaries evolves essential [ 7 ] . In such conditions , innovation intermediaries enable those innovation network actors who have difficulty finding partners in technological and innovative collaboration by networking between actors in an open environment [ 8 ] – [ 10 ] . The innovation intermediaries have emerged in the industrial context and execute various tasks in the innovation process within industries . Nevertheless , these actors are not heretofore well known . There are limited industries in which the function of innovation intermediaries has been scrutinized . Many studies still emphasize the research gap in this area , although these actors have been studied in the innovation literature [ 11 ] – [ 14 ] . There are economic , strategic , and technological needs in developing countries for space industry evolution . With a growing trend , these countries are trying to create their space industry and achieve their desired capabilities in this industry [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .

Accordingly , this study investigates and analyzes the phenomenon of innovation intermediaries in Iran ' s civilian space industry innovation network from the viewpoint of experts and policy - makers . Consequently , the research pursues to answer these questions : ( 1 ) how is innovation intermediary done to network in the Iranian space industry ? ( 2 ) What are intermediary actors ' prominent roles and functions in the space industry ? Furthermore , ( 3 ) what are the challenges and improvements in the intermediary activities of the actors operating in the space industry innovation network ? After answering these questions and in an attempt to help Iranian space industry policy - makers , we will answer the question : What policy solutions do experts suggest for the development and evolution of the Iranian space industry ? II . LITERATURE REVIEW Innovation intermediary . In an actors ' network throughout an industry , interaction and communication with other actors are not easily possible , and there are several problems [ 2 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] . In cases where the firm alone cannot carry out the innovation process , a new actor is needed to leverage this process . Innovation intermediary is a concept in innovation studies that helps construct a wide range of knowledge and organizations to create successful innovation [ 17 ] . These actors , known by different names in innovation literature , are mainly referred to as innovation intermediaries [ 7 ] . They are particular kinds of actors and are known for their skills , experience , and knowledge enveloping a expansive range of industries [ 18 ] . Howells defines an innovation intermediary as " an organization or body " with a broad umbrella term that acts as an agency or intermediary in various aspects of the innovation process between two or more actor [ 6 ] . Outlining the concepts retained in the definitions of innovation intermediaries to provide a more precise understanding of these actors shows a focus on the following concepts : as a heterogeneous phenomenon in innovation processes [ 19 ] , of an incongruous nature [ 2 ] , as intermediate entities for a sector [ 20 ] , as technology transferors [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , as a link between supply and demand [ 14 ] , as an agency or intermediary [ 6 ] , independent agencies [ 23 ] , as a third party , including independent third parties or third organizations [ 2 ] , as public , private or non - profit organizations [ 20 ] , as a facilitator actor [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , as a member of the network , including kind of network actors [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , and knowledge warehouse in the network [ 13 ] . Accordingly , it must be admitted that these actors play a very prominent role in innovation networks . Open network innovation processes are coordinated through invisible hands , which are innovation intermediaries [ 26 ] and , as a market intermediary [ 18 ] , facilitate market - technology coordination [ 7 ] . Hence , the central value proposition of innovation intermediaries is to bridge the various gaps between internal and external know - hows [ 2 ] . Innovation intermediary defines the facilitation of the innovation process as the core of its business , along with acting as a source of innovation transfer , with an impartial and disconnected position [ 17 ] , [ 27 ] , and therefore , creates opportunities for other actors [ 28 ] . As networking entities between actors in an open environment , innovation intermediaries support those innovation network actors who have difficulty finding partners in technological and innovative collaboration [ 6 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] . Types of innovation intermediary activities based on literature . Researchers have focused on innovation intermediary stream in the last two decades . Accordingly , they have offered different views in response to these actors ' activities . These can be defined into four categories : ( 1 ) in the innovation process , ( 2 ) in the innovation network , ( 3 ) in the relationship between supply and demand , and ( 4 ) in macro - level intermediary activities . In the innovation process - including in different dimensions of the innovation process [ 6 ] , creating synergies between stakeholders in the innovation process [ 23 ] , reducing innovation process problems [ 2 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] , providing a platform for developing other actors ' innovation process [ 28 ] , pursuing external knowledge [ 13 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , solving collaboration problems and capture value by providing solutions [ 12 ] , [ 31 ] , enabling innovation [ 33 ] , strengthening innovation , building innovativeness capability [ 25 ] , providing new combinations of knowledge [ 13 ] , [ 32 ] , and problem - solving [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] . In the innovation network - including facilitating interactions between other actors in the innovation network [ 5 ] , enabling increase innovation in projects ( horizontal view ) [ 36 ] , networking between actors [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , network and knowledge integrators and creating value for other actors [ 10 ] , facilitating knowledge and technology transfer between actors [ 22 ] , [ 34 ] , bridging gaps between internal and external know - hows as the primary value proposition [ 2 ] , [ 22 ] , creating opportunities for other actors , designating and maintaining relationships between different people and entities [ 22 ] , [ 37 ] , training , collecting , and distributing human and financial resources [ 38 ] . In the relationship between two different sides - including facilitating supply and demand coordination [ 19 ] , coordinating supply and demand ( vertical view ) [ 36 ] , the center of interaction and communication between users and knowledge producers [ 17 ] , [ 32 ] , and communication between supply and demand [ 2 ] . In macro - level intermediary activities - including facilitating technology transfer from the national to the firm level [ 22 ] , [ 39 ] , the architecture of the innovation ecosystem infrastructure [ 12 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , and facilitating complex interactions in emerging areas of knowledge [ 2 ] . Typology of innovation intermediaries - Intermediaries can be considered an actor ' s role and identity in the innovation network . Intermediary - related activities can be offered in two ways . The intermediary actor performs the intermediary activities as a role when the intermediary activity is an actor ' s identity . It creates ambiguity between the intermediary as a role and the intermediary as an identity . Therefore , hearmur & Doloreux ( 2019 ) tried to reveal this ambiguity in the innovation literature and achieve a better understanding of the intermediary concept ( Fig . 1 ) [ 33 ] . Fig . 1 . " Literature on intermediaries : from identity to role " [ 33 ] With this introduction to the nature and typology of intermediary , Table I provides a comprehensive overview of the actors who play the role or identity of innovation intermediary . TABLE I : INNOVATION INTERMEDIARY IN THEMATIC LITERATURE ( SOURCE : RESEARCHERS ) Researcher Intermediary actor ( role or identity ) [ 14 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] Universities [ 12 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 43 ] Research institutes [ 14 ] , [ 44 ] – [ 46 ] Academic , commercial , and business incubators [ 14 ] , [ 45 ] – [ 47 ] Science and technology parks [ 14 ] , [ 45 ] , [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] Living Labs [ 8 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 50 ] Open innovation platforms [ 14 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 51 ] Venture capitalists [ 14 ] , [ 52 ] Entrepreneurship centers [ 14 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 45 ] , [ 51 ] , [ 53 ] Technology , IP , and knowledge transfer offices [ 17 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] Knowledge - intensive business services and knowledge brokers [ 9 ] Innovation markets [ 12 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 56 ] Inter - enterprise networking organizations Space industry : The space industry is a high - tech industry where innovation intermediaries , as a crucial player , significantly affect the growth of this industry [ 57 ] . The space industry is defined as " the super - set of all industries and segments included in all demonstrated and potential space markets " [ 58 ] . The actors in this industry have grown significantly over the last four decades . It has grown from a government - based industry to a high - value - added one . Space industry actors can be categorized at different levels . The sector , industry , market , and ecosystem levels affect the space industry market development [ 59 ] . Industrial policy - makers , space agencies , and governments are key players in the space industry . In addition to these actors , a large number of private sector actors are also involved in the formation of the space industry innovation network [ 16 ] , [ 57 ] , [ 60 ] . At the upstream and downstream of Iran ' s space industry , there are various entities as the main actors in innovation network development at the industry level , which play a role as policy actors at the industry level : Iranian Space Agency , Vice - Presidency for Science and Technology ( STPs ) , Supreme Council of Space , and Aerospace Research Institute 1 . Other actors of the space industry innovation network include Space Research Institute 2 , universities , incubators , startups , SMEs , knowledge - based companies , innovation centers , parks , and financiers [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 61 ] . The literature review on grounded theory ( GT ) is more than just producing evidence to justify the study . The literature review includes methods for shaping data . Despite the differing views of GT study researchers , it is necessary to review the literature before beginning such studies . Accordingly , the reflexivity from the literature within GT research is essential to challenge previous views [ 62 ] , [ 63 ] . Therefore , by reviewing the thematic literature on innovation intermediaries , classification and typology of activities , type of intermediary activities at different levels , identifying space industry actors at different levels , we not only seek to justify the evidence but also try to make a pure study , in a new context using the GT approach . Thus , we see the reflexivity of 1 This research institute is a subsidiary of the Ministry of Science , Research , and Technology and was established in 1996 to build a relationship between the university and industry in aerospace sciences . 2 This research institute is a subsidiary of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and was launched in 2011 to meet the country ' s needs for space science and technology . literature in this research and its results . After reviewing the research method , findings , and conclusions , we finally provide suggestions for future studies . III . RESEARCH METHOD Grounded theory is a research strategy that seeks to develop a theory or model based on conceptual data extracted within a systematic behavior [ 64 ] . This strategy is particularly applicable in research areas about which little information is available , and studies are needed to gain tacit knowledge in that area [ 65 ] , [ 66 ] . In other words , the main idea underlying grounded theory is to develop a theory or model based on data from interactions with participants who have experienced and conceptualized the phenomenon in their original context ( here , space industry innovations ) . This study was conducted using the GT strategy and aimed at investigating the intermediary phenomenon in the Iranian space industry innovation network . GT is also well - suited for research questions like " what ' s going on here ? " [ 67 ] . Therefore , this study seeks to answer these questions : ( 1 ) how is innovation intermediary done to network in the Iranian space industry ? ( 2 ) What are intermediary actors ' leading roles and functions in the space industry ? Furthermore , ( 3 ) what are the challenges and improvements in the intermediary activities of actors operating in the space industry innovation network ? After answering these questions and in an attempt to help Iranian space industry policy - makers , we will answer the question : " What policy solutions do experts suggest for the development and evolution of the Iranian space industry ? " No study has yet been conducted in the Iranian space industry to examine the innovation intermediary processes and systems . How intermediary - related entities are formed , and their function in improving the quality of innovation and collaboration in the space industry innovation network is essential for the Iranian government and industrial policy - makers . In order to address such a gap , qualitative GT methodology is used to understand innovation intermediary processes and systems through interaction with experienced scientific and industrial experts . The GT strategy seeks to simultaneously collect , conceptualize , and analyze data through an inductive approach [ 68 ] . GT discovers emerging patterns in data , helps develop theory , offers an explanation , and , in general , solves and processes a phenomenon , which is one of the primary considerations of the population . In GT , researchers are free to choose the respondent sample and data collection methods to conceptually label and describe the phenomenon [ 69 ] , [ 70 ] . In GT research , theoretical sampling is a technique derived from concepts and will continue until the findings do not add value to emerging concepts [ 64 ] , [ 71 ] . In this study , snowball sampling continued until the theoretical saturation results [ 66 ] . In GT , the data collection process continues until the data is saturated . Guest et al . ( 2020 ) state that data saturation occurs in the 7 th to 12 th interviews , while the main categories are identified in the first to sixth interviews [ 72 ] . Another study by Namey et al . ( 2020 ) found that saturation of meanings and codes occurs in the range of 8 th to 16 th interviews [ 73 ] . After conducting sixteen interviews with industry experts in the present study , the final data were categorized and analyzed within a code booklet . Professionals , university professors , and industry experts with over a decade of experience in the space industry were selected as participants through the snowball method . These participants include senior executives in the Vice - Presidency for Science and Technology , senior executives from the Space Agency , managers of satellite design and production projects , top managers and consultants at the Space Research Institute and Aerospace Research Institute , and three university professors in the space industry . The table II , shows a list of participants and their positions at the space industry level .

The coding results were reviewed in interaction with the interviewee . This method was used throughout data collection , analysis , labeling , and writing categories . All data from interviews , observations , notes , documents , and reports were coded and analyzed in the GT triple coding process ( open , axial , and selective coding ) using MAXQDA20 software ; ( Open coding is the starting point for extracting and labeling the main categories to achieve the concepts ; axial coding is the formation of concepts and the relationships between them ; and selective coding is the formation of categories and their relationships to reach the final theory or model [ 74 ] ) . In this study , before the interview session , the framework and purpose of the research were provided to the participants in the form of a text file . Then , during the interview session , by conducting a semi - structured interview , the main research questions focused on the following : " participants ' experiences with those activities of network actors that refer to innovation intermediary ; how to do innovation intermediary in the space industry innovation network ; the intensity of actors ' intermediary activities ; the role and function of the intermediary that each actor plays in the industry ; and finally , proposing a policy and strategy for the development and evolution of Iran ' s space industry . " IV . FINDINGS The researchers analyzed the data simultaneously in the collection process . They followed the GT coding steps to identify and categorize the intermediary dimensions for networking in the space industry . In other words , there was a two - step coding process in the analysis process in which the data were first inductively coded . Then the classification results were constantly discussed with industry experts / research participants to avoid ambiguity in the findings . In the final analysis of the findings , six categories and 23 subcategories were identified , summarized in Table III . TABLE III : INTERMEDIARY CATEGORIES AND SUBCATEGORIES IN THE IRANIAN SPACE INDUSTRY INNOVATION NETWORK Subcategory Category − Networking between actors to develop space knowledge and technology − Diversity in communication infrastructure for network development − Formation of collaborative activities in the space industry innovation network Networking − Support for institutionalization in the space industry − Providing the Infrastructure for the evolution of the industry trajectory Evolution of innovation network − Optimizing network interactions and communications − Actors ' activities with intermediary identities in the space industry innovation network − Facilitation and brokery in the space industry Intermediate interactions and communications − Increasing the number of private actors in the industry innovation network − Diversity of actors in the space industry innovation network − Support the formation and growth of new network actors − Private sector - focused networking − New knowledge combination and production in the space industry Support for the formation of emergent actors − Regulatory activities in the space industry − The legitimacy of emergent actors − Accreditation and regulation − Arbitration and conflict resolution in the innovation process Regulatory and deregulation activities − Authoritarianism in industry − Interferences and conflicts in policy actors ' role − Weak policymaking , legislation , and planning in the space industry − Weaknesses in the implementation of plans − Weak market - making and space economy development − Weaknesses in international collaborative activities Intermediary challenges and barriers Networking : The networking category as an industry development strategy has been approved by industrial policy - makers over the past two decades . As an intermediary at the macro level , the industrial innovation network actors support the diversity of resources , infrastructure provision , and the variety of actors operating in the industry . These are a prerequisite for networking through intermediary activities by key industry players . Intermediary of policy actors in the Iranian space industry , focusing on removing barriers to the formation and emergence of new actors and optimizing the innovation network while focusing on the private sector , proposes networking as an effective strategy in the space industry . In line with the characteristics of the space industry 4 . 0 [ 75 ] , this trend has contributed to the evolution of the space industry innovation network . As a result of this intermediary activity , there are various resources for creating the space industry network . The necessary infrastructure has been provided to develop an innovation network at the industry level . Interactions based on the analysis and identification of innovation needs between private sector actors and the space industry innovation network have led to the growing trend of new types of private sector actors such as startups , incubators , and innovation centers entering the industry . Accordingly , supporting the institutionalization and formation of new actors and empowering network actors are intermediary activities at the macro level . Evolution of innovation network . Network - level intermediary activities have provided dynamism in networking through collaborations and the development and sharing of knowledge and space technology among the innovation network actors , including technological development based on inter - network collaboration between actors , a collaboration between universities in the design and construction of satellite prototypes , outsourcing of technological subsystems to knowledge - based companies , and the partnership of these companies with universities to achieve the know - how accumulated at the university . It has led to the growth and evolution of the innovation network . In other words , the intermediary focuses more on shaping communications , interactions , and collaborations and facilitating these interactions and communications in the space industry innovation network to establish a link between supply and demand . Innovation intermediaries by actors in the innovation network positively affected network development through regulatory and deregulation activities . Regulatory and deregulation activities . Regulatory activity in the space industry is carried out by policy actors such as the Space Agency , the Space Technology Development Headquarters in the Vice - Presidency for Science and Technology , the Supreme Council of Space , and the Aerospace Research Institute . These actors mediate through functions such as legitimizing emergent actors ( e . g . , innovation centers , incubators , startups , and knowledge - based companies ) and defining the everyday activities of these actors . Macro - level policy actors also address barriers to developing the space industry innovation network through accreditation , regulation , arbitration , and conflict resolution between actors operating in the space industry innovation network during the innovation process . Intermediary challenges and barriers . There are different obstacles to innovation intermediary in the Iranian space industry innovation network . The space industry is inherently costly , and R & D costs are high . Due to the high cost of R & D and upstream innovation activities , upstream entry costs are high for new players , which has hindered the industry ' s balanced upstream development . The defense and non - defense sectors , both of which are stakeholders in the space industry , have two different perspectives on the industry . The defense sector pays little attention to the development and exploitation of the space economy . In contrast , the civilian / non - defense sector views the development of the space economy with a space 4 . 0 approach . Finally , the challenge of weak market - making and globalization of the space industry has negatively affected intermediary activities at the industry level . Another critical challenge is policymaking , legislation , planning , and implementation . Factors that lead to such a challenge include strict reliance on government funding , constraints on lack of proper legislation for space industry operators , poor training and development of the required human resource , a weak holistic mindset in policymaking and planning , individual - based planning at various points in time , constant changes in rules and regulations in government financial support , and the removal of barriers to the entry and operation of new actors , parallel policymaking by policy actors , weak executive management to implement plans and policies , and in particular a lack of continuous planning in the implementation of policies and procedures . These factors have challenged the development of the industry . They have affected the intermediary activities of the actors in the evolution of the industry innovation network . Intermediate interactions and communications . In the Iranian space industry , policy actors help optimize interactions and communications in the innovation network by supporting the entry of private sector actors into the innovation network and deregulation to facilitate the formation of these businesses . In addition , macro knowledge actors ( research institutes and universities ) support the diversity of new actors and outsource some activities based on the know - how development to these actors to agile their activities . In this regard , by developing communication with these new actors in their communication network , knowledge actors facilitate and diversify communication in the innovation network . Support for the formation of emergent actors . As mentioned earlier , different actors are present and active in the space industry innovation network ( Fig . 2 ) . The intermediary activities of government actors , along with other influential actors in the space industry innovation network , positively affect the diversification of actors . Universities working with a network of private actors around their network , the Vice - Presidency for Science and Technology supporting the diversification of knowledge - based companies , support to increase and diversify actors with a focus on the private sector ( e . g . , facilitating the establishment and liaison with industry , seed money , training , and complimentary services , and helping enter corporate communication networks ) , and finally with the support of macro actors such as universities and research institutes to meet their technological and innovative needs are emerging innovation network activities that combine existing accumulated knowledge to respond to innovations to meet the needs of these macro industry - wide actors . Fig . 2 . The intensity of actors ' innovation intermediary activity in the Iranian space industry innovation network The status of intermediary activities of the space industry innovation network actors is summarized in Fig . 2 . The government actors , mainly intermediaries with a regulatory and deregulation role and macro - level intermediaries , have a high intensity of intermediary activities . On the other hand , the intensity of intermediary activities of the other three main actors in the innovation network ( innovation centers , science and technology parks , and funding actors such as venture capitals and funds ) that leverage innovation is very low . The innovation intermediary activities of actors such as startups , knowledge - based companies , and SMEs are often based on supply and demand with other actors at the innovation network level . In other words , these actors do innovation intermediary solely based on their need for know - how and resources of other actors or provide their resources and know - how in response to the needs of other actors . In addition to supply - demand intermediary activities , Incubators also engage in intermediary activities in the innovation process and innovation intermediary at the network level . The Supreme Council of Space , which as a policy - maker can play a significant role in developing the space industry innovation network through regulation , has not played a prominent role in the macro - level intermediary . Fig . 3 presents eight subcategories of innovation intermediary in the Iranian space industry innovation network . Overall , based on the findings , it should be acknowledged that the formation and diversity of innovation intermediary activities in the space industry have led to more significant support for networking and space industry development , space economy development , industrial development opportunities in line with global trends , and increasing diversity of private sector actors . V . CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION Results of the analysis . This study attempted to investigate the intermediary phenomenon in an evolving context in the space industry innovation network , as a high - tech industry , based on the industrial experts ' views . Accordingly , we studied the intermediary phenomenon in the Iranian civilian space industry based on a qualitative approach . This study discussed innovation intermediary from the industry experts ' perspective , examined the main dimensions of this space phenomenon in an Iranian context , and based on the innovation intermediary theory . We have also proposed some policy solutions for the development and evolution of Iran ' s space industry . High intensity of intermediary activity Low intensity of intermediary Space Research Center Vice - Presidency for Science and Technology Iran Space Agency Aerospace research center universities Space Supreme Council Accelerators SMEs Knowledgebase Firms Innovation Centers Funds and VCs STPs Incubators Startups Fig . 3 . Eight subcategories of innovation intermediary in the Iranian space industry innovation network Therefore , this article responded to two theoretical and contextual gaps : ( 1 ) the study of the intermediary phenomenon in high - tech industries and developing countries as a theoretical gap [ 57 ] , [ 76 ] and , ( 2 ) the growth path of the Iranian space industry , a newcomer with high growth rate , as a contextual gap [ 16 ] , [ 77 ] , [ 78 ] . The findings of this study provide significant outputs in response to these two gaps . Conclusions . As we reviewed the literature on four different categories of innovation intermediary activities ( innovation intermediary ( 1 ) in the innovation process , ( 2 ) in the innovation network , ( 3 ) in the relationship between supply and demand , and ( 4 ) macro - level intermediary activities ) , we observed the extent to which actors in the space industry innovation network present innovation intermediary activities . According to Fig . 2 , we examined the intensity of intermediary activity of each one of the actors in the space industry . The intermediary has emerged mainly in large - scale intermediary activities in the Iranian space industry . It has received less attention among supply - demand actors or actors who play a significant role in the innovation process at the network level ( e . g . , science and technology parks , knowledge - based companies , innovation centers , and financiers ) . Also , the intensity of intermediary is very low at the level of interactions between micro and often emergent actors and in the dynamic industrial context . As a result , innovation intermediary has a negligible effect on industrial growth and development at this level of actors . In collaboration with the participants , they were asked to express their views on macro policies and strategies that could contribute to the development of the Iranian space industry . By summarizing the industrial experts ' opinions and suggestions , three policy solutions regarding the innovation intermediary in the Iranian space industry innovation network are proposed : 1 ) The need for better planning and policymaking to resolve the conflicting views at the policymaking level : Shift from an authoritarian perspective to the space economy development leads the Iranian space industry to global growth . In this regard , consolidating the nature of policy actors who play macro - level intermediaries significantly affects the evolution of the space industry innovation network . 2 ) Innovation intermediary functions include further downstream industry development by supporting private sector intermediary activities , facilitating the entry of the private sector , paving the way for the entry of emergent actors , and creating synergies between the emerging digital economy in an Iranian context and space industry startups downstream that need more attention in the Iranian space industry . 3 ) The space operators act as a facilitator at the network level with a powerful intermediary between the upstream and downstream sectors of the industry value chain . According to innovation intermediary theory , these actors can lead the network as facilitators and coordinators . They can be good moderators for technology push and market pull . Supporting the formation of the private operator as a facilitator will accelerate the growth of the space industry innovation network and thus the evolution of the space economy . further research . According to the study , for further research in this field , it is suggested that more studies investigate the impact of innovation intermediary on the space industry innovation network to develop the Iranian space economy . Also , due to non - transparency in the Iranian space industry value chain , it is suggested that a new study examine the model of formation and evolution of the Iranian space industry value chain and investigate the impact of innovation intermediary on the development of the space industry value chain . The results indicate that the venture capital investment industry actors , who act as dynamism for forming innovation networks and ecosystems and are intermediaries , play a fragile role in the Iranian space industry . Finally , it is suggested that an in - depth field study examine the activities of these actors in the Iranian digital economy and space economy and discuss the differences in the activity level of these actors in these two sectors of the emerging economy .
