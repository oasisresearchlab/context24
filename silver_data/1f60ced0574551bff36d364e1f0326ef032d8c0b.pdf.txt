Epithelium morphogenesis and oviduct development are regulated by significant increase of expression of genes after long - term in vitro primary culture – a microarray assays Abstract The correct oviductal development and morphogenesis of its epithelium are crucial factors influencing fe - male fertility . Oviduct is involved in maintaining an optimal environment for gametes and preimplantation embryo development ; secretory oviductal epithelial cells ( OECs ) synthesize components of oviductal fluid . Oviductal epithelium also participates in sperm binding and its hyperactivation . For better understanding of the genetic bases that underlay porcine oviductal development , OECs were isolated from porcine ovi - ducts and established long - term primary culture . A microarray approach was utilized to determine the differentially expressed genes during specific time periods . Cells were harvested on day 7 , 15 and 30 of in vitro primary culture and their RNA was isolated . Gene expression was analyzed and statistical analysis was performed . 48 differentially expressed genes belonging to “tube morphogenesis” , “tube development” , “morphogenesis of an epithelium” , “morphogenesis of branching structure” and “morphogenesis of bran - ching epithelium” GO BP terms were selected , of which 10 most upregulated include BMP4 , ARG1 , SLIT2 , FGFR1 , DAB2 , TNC , EPAS1 , HHEX , ITGB3 and LOX . The results help to shed light on the porcine oviductal development and its epithelial morphogenesis , and show that after long - term culture the OECs still proli - ferate and maintain their tube forming properties .

Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 196 Introduction The correct oviductal morphogenesis and its epi - thelium development are crucial factors influencing female fertility , as they are involved in both fertiliza - tion and early embryo development . However , ge - netic regulation of these processes in pigs remains to be elucidated . The oviduct derives from the Müllerian duct , which originates from the intermediate mesoderm and starts to develop around E11 . 5 in mice [ 1 ] . Ini - tially , embryos have both Müllerian and Wolffian ducts , thus they are anatomically undistinguish - able . However , after the sexual differentiation , the Wolffian ducts degenerate in female embryos and the Müllerian duct further develops . In male em - bryos this situation is opposite [ 2 ] . Significant genes involved in this process , such as Lim1 , Lhx1 , Pax2 , Emx2 , Wnt4 , Wnt9b , Tcf2 , Dach1 and Dach2 , have been distinguished [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] . Further develop - ment results in oviduct , uterus and upper vagina formation and subsequent epithelial differentia - tion , which likely remains under control of the Hox genes , especially Hoxa10 , Hoxa11 and Hoxa13 , as well as Wnt7a gene [ 2 , 3 ] . The timing of epithelial differentiation varies between species ; in humans it occurs in the fetal stage , while in mice it takes place postnatally [ 5 ] . Epithelial morphogenesis involves several events , such as apicobasal polarity and lu - men formation , which can occur through epithelial folding , wrapping or invagination . Among many sig - naling pathways engaged in tubulogenesis , the inte - grin - mediated signaling pathway and FGF signaling pathway seem to be one of the most significant [ 6 ] . Four oviductal regions can be distinguished : the infundibulum , the ampulla , the isthmus and the uterotubal junction . Oviduct has two muscle coats ( longitudinal and circular ) , a mucosa layer , which exhibits folds with a branch - like structure , and epi - thelial lining [ 7 , 8 ] . There are two types of epithelial cells in the oviduct : ciliated and secretory cells . The ciliated cells play a significant role in transporting gametes and the embryo , and their characteristics may vary between pig breeds [ 9 , 10 ] . Secretory cells synthesize components of oviductal fluid , such as nutrients , cytokines , immunoglobulins and embry - otropic factors , thus participate in providing an op - timal environment for fertilization and promote the early embryo development [ 11 ] . The presence of stem - like cells in the oviductal epithelium has also been reported [ 12 ] . The oviductal role is invaluable in a successful pregnancy , however its detailed mechanism is be - yond the scope of this paper . Aside from providing an optimal environment for gametes and preim - plantation embryo development , oviduct guides sperm to fertilization site through rheotaxis , ther - motaxis and chemotaxis [ 9 ] . Oviductal epithelial cells also bind sperm [ 13 ] and are involved in its hyperactivation [ 14 ] . For better understanding of the genetic bases that underlay porcine oviductal development and mor - phogenesis of its epithelium , a long - term primary culture of porcine oviductal epithelial cells has been established , with microarray approach utilized to determine the differentially expressed genes during specific time periods . Such studies may be helpful in optimizing assisted reproduction techniques in pigs , which still remain less successful than in other species [ 15 ] , and in understanding genetic events that lead to epithelial tube formation in pigs . Materials and Methods Animals In this study , crossbred gilts ( n = 45 ) at the age of about nine months , which displayed two regular es - trous cycles , were collected from a commercial herd . All the animals were checked daily for estrus behav - ior and were slaughtered after reaching the anestrus phase of the estrus cycle . The uteri were then trans - ported to the laboratory within 30 min at 38°C . Oviductal epithelial cells ( OECs ) selection and culture Oviducts were washed twice in Dulbecco’s phos - phate buffered saline ( PBS ) ( 137 mM NaCl , 27 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) . Epithe - lial cells were removed using sterile surgical blades . Then , the epithelium was incubated with collagenase I ( Sigma Aldrich , Madison , USA ) , 1mg / mL in Dulbec - co’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ; Sigma Aldrich , Madison , USA ) for 1 h at 37 o C . The cell suspension obtained from this digestion was filtered through 40 µm pore size strainer to remove blood and single cells . The residue was collected by rinsing the strain - er with DMEM . The cell suspension was centrifuged ( 200 x g , 10 min . ) . Next , the cells were washed in PBS and centrifuged again . Later , they were incubated with 0 . 5 % Trypsin / EDTA ( Sigma Aldrich , Madison , USA ) at 37 o C for 10 min . The reaction was stopped with fetal calf serum ( FCS ; Sigma Aldrich , Madison , USA ) . After incubation , cells where filtered and cen - trifuged again . The final cell pellet was suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS , 100U / mL peni - cillin , 100 µg / mL streptomycin and 1µg / mL ampho - tericin B . The cells were cultured at 37 o C in a humid - ified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . Once the OEC cultures attained 70 – 80 % confluency , they were passaged by washing with PBS , digested with 0 . 025 % Trypsin / EDTA , neutralized by a 0 . 0125 % trypsin inhibitor ( Cascade Biologics , Portland , USA ) , centrifuged , and resuspended at a seeding density of 2x10 4 cells / cm 2 . The culture medium was changed every three days . The culture lasted 30 days . RNA extraction from oviductal epithelial cells ( OECs ) Oviductal epithelial cell were pooled and har - vested at 24h , 7 days , 15 days and 30 days after Stefańska et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 197 the beginning of culture . Total RNA was extracted from samples using TRI Reagent ( Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) and RNeasy MinElute cleanup Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . The amount of total mRNA was determined from the optical density at 260 nm , and the RNA purity was estimated using the 260 / 280 nm absorption ratio ( higher than 1 . 8 ) ( NanoDrop spec - trophotometer , Thermo Scientific , ALAB , Poland ) . The RNA integrity and quality were checked on a Bioanalyzer 2100 ( Agilent Technologies , Inc . , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . The resulting RNA integrity numbers ( RINs ) were between 8 . 5 and 10 with an average of 9 . 2 ( Agilent Technologies , Inc . , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . The RNA in each sample was diluted to a concen - tration of 100 ng / μl with an OD260 / OD280 ratio of 1 . 8 / 2 . 0 . From each RNA sample , 100 ng of RNA was taken for microarray expression assays . Microarray expression analysis and statistics Total RNA ( 100 ng ) from each pooled sample was subjected to two rounds of sense cDNA amplifica - tion ( Ambion® WT Expression Kit ) . The obtained cDNA was used for biotin labeling and fragmenta - tion by Affymetrix GeneChip ® WT Terminal Labeling and Hybridization ( Affymetrix ) . Biotin - labeled frag - ments of cDNA ( 5 . 5 μg ) were hybridized to the Affy - metrix® Porcine Gene 1 . 1 ST Array Strip ( 48°C / 20 h ) . Microarrays were then washed and stained according to the technical protocol using the Affy - metrix GeneAtlas Fluidics Station . The array strips were scanned employing Imaging Station of the Ge - neAtlas System . Preliminary analysis of the scanned chips was performed using Affymetrix GeneAtlas TM Operating Software . The quality of gene expression data was confirmed according to the quality control criteria provided by the software . The obtained CEL files were imported into downstream data analysis software . All of the presented analyses and graphs were performed using Bioconductor and R programming languages . Each CEL file was merged with a descrip - tion file . In order to correct background , normalize , and summarize results , we used the Robust Multi - array Averaging ( RMA ) algorithm . To determine the statistical significance of the analyzed genes , mod - erated t - statistics from the empirical Bayes method were performed . The obtained p - value was correct - ed for multiple comparisons using Benjamini and Hochberg’s false discovery rate . The selection of significantly altered genes was based on a p - value beneath 0 . 05 and expression higher than two fold . Differentially expressed genes were subjected selection by examination of genes involved in ovi - ductal epithelium morphogenesis . The differential - ly expressed gene list was uploaded to the DAVID software ( Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery ) [ 14 ] . Subsequently the relation between the genes belonging to chosen GO terms with GOplot package was analyzed [ 15 ] . The GoPlot package had calculated the z - score : the number of up - regulated genes minus the number of down - regulated genes divided by the square root of the count . This information allowed for estimating the change course of each gene - ontology term . Moreover , interactions between differentially ex - pressed genes / proteins belonging to the chosen GO terms were investigated by the STRING10 software ( Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes ) [ 16 ] . The list of gene names was used as a query for an interaction prediction . The search criteria were based on co - occurrences of genes / proteins in sci - entific texts ( text mining ) , co - expression , and ex - perimentally observed interactions . The results of such analyses generated a gene / protein interaction network , where the intensity of the edges reflected the strength of the interaction score . Finally the functional interactions between genes that belongs to the chosen GO BP terms were inves - tigated by REACTOME FIViz application to the Cy - toscape 3 . 6 . 0 software . The ReactomeFIViz app is designed to find pathways and network patterns related to cancer and other types of diseases . This app accesses the pathways stored in the Reactome database , allowing to do pathway enrichment anal - ysis for a set of genes , visualize hit pathways using manually laid - out pathway diagrams directly in Cytoscape , and investigate functional relationships among genes in hit pathways . The app can also access the Reactome Functional Interaction ( FI ) network , a highly reliable , manually curated path - way - based protein functional interaction network covering over 60 % of human proteins .

Results Whole transcriptome profiling by Affymetrix mi - croarray allows analyzing gene expression changes between 7 , 15 and 30 days of porcine oviductal ep - ithelial cells culture . By Affymetrix® Porcine Gene 1 . 1 ST Array Strip we examined expression of 12257 transcripts . Genes with fold change higher then abs ( 2 ) and wit corrected p value lower than 0 . 05 were considered as differentially expressed . This set of genes consists of 2533 different transcripts . The first detailed analysis based on GO BP the identifi - cation of differentially expressed genes belonging to the significantly enrichment GO BP terms . DAVID ( Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery ) software was used for extraction of gene ontology biological process term ( GO BP ) that contains differently expressed tran - scripts . Up and down regulated gene sets were sub - jected to DAVID searching separately and only gene Stefańska et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 198 sets where adj . p value were lower than 0 . 05 were selected . The DAVID software analysis showed that differently expressed genes belongs to 657 Gene on - tology terms . In this paper we focused on 48 genes that belongs to “tube morphogenesis” , “tube devel - opment” , “morphogenesis of an epithelium” , “mor - phogenesis of a branching structure” and “morpho - genesis of a branching epithelium” GO BP terms . These sets of genes were subjected to hierarchical clusterization procedure and presented as heat - maps ( Fig . 1 ) .

Arbitrary signal intensity acquired from microarray analysis is represented by co - lors ( green , higher ; red , lower expression ) . Log2 signal intensity values for any single gene were resized to Row Z - Score scale ( from - 2 , the lowest expression to + 2 , the highest expression for single gene ) Stefańska et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 199 of that genes were shown in table 1 . To investigate the direction of changes between each selected GO BP term , its z - score ( the ratio of up - and down - reg - ulated genes in each GO BP terms ) was calculated . The z - scores with the representation of up - and down - regulated genes were shown in series of cir - cle diagrams ( Fig . 2 ) . In Gene Ontology database , genes that formed one particular GO group can also belong to other different GO term categories . For this reason , we explore the gene intersections between selected GO BP terms . The relation between those GO BP terms was presented as circle plot ( Fig . 3 ) as well as heatmap ( Fig . 4 ) . STRING software was used to generate interac - tion network among differentially expressed genes belonging to each of selected GO BP terms . This prediction method provided us a molecular interac - tion network formed between protein products of studied genes ( Fig . 5 ) . Finally we investigated the functional interactions between chosen genes with REACTOME FIViz app to Cytoscape 3 . 6 . 0 software . The results were shown in figure 6 . Discussion To investigate which genes are involved in por - cine oviductal development and its epithelial mor - phogenesis , we utilized the whole transcriptome profiling method in porcine OEC long - term primary culture , and compared gene expression on day 7 , 15 and 30 . We have found 48 differentially expressed genes belonging to “tube morphogenesis” , “tube development” , “morphogenesis of an epithelium” , “morphogenesis of branching structure” and “mor - phogenesis of branching epithelium” GO BP terms . However we would like to focus on 10 genes that exhibited the most significant increase in expres - sion . These genes include BMP4 , FGFR1 , TNC , ITGB3 , DAB2 , SLIT2 , HHEX , EPAS1 , LOX and ARG1 , most of which are involved in multiple signaling pathways associated with many developmental processes in the entire organism . Amongst the aforementioned genes , the BMP4 gene can be distinguished . It is a part of TGFβ super - family of factors and is involved in many develop - mental processes , such as cartilage and bone forma - tion . It acts via SMAD signaling pathway , influencing gene expression [ 19 ] . Also , the role of BMP4 in repro - duction has been reported , as it participates in germ cell proliferation , migration , gametogenesis , follicu - logenesis and steroidogenesis [ 20 ] . Its expression occurs in the rat theca cells and ovarian and uterine epithelium , in mice granulosa and theca cells and in human oocyte and granulosa cells [ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ] . Moreover , Tanwar et al . [ 24 ] reported BMP4 expres - sion in murine oviductal epithelial cells , while we ob - served an increase in this gene’s expression in por - cine OECs on day 7 and 15 of primary in vitro culture . This suggests that this factor may be involved in OEC development as well , aside from its multifunctional role during other tissues morphogenesis .

In following figure “ - > ” stands for activating / catalyzing , “ - | ” for inhibition , “ - ” for FIs extracted from complexes or inputs , and “ - - - ” for predicted FIs Stefańska et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 202 Based on interaction visualization ( Fig . 5 ) BMP4 interacts with FGFR1 , which is a receptor for fibro - blast growth factors , that are involved in many pro - cesses , such as cell growth , maturation and division , angiogenesis and embryogenesis [ 25 ] . FGFR1 ex - pression gradually increased during in vitro culture , reaching the highest level on day 30 ; therefore it is another gene upregulated in OECs that is not spe - cific for oviductal epithelium and is also expressed during many other developmental events . It has been reported , that FGFR1 is crucial for correct neu - ral tube development [ 26 ] . Pond et al . have shown that it is engaged in mammary gland branching morphogenesis [ 27 ] . As FGF signaling pathway is well known to be involved in tubular morphogene - sis , increased expression of FGFR1 during long - term OECs in vitro culture suggests that it also plays a role in epithelial tube development in porcine oviducts , and that the OECs maintain tube forming properties after long - term in vitro culture . Apart from that , this receptor’s expression occurs e . g . in bovine corpus luteum [ 28 ] and porcine endometrial epithelial cells , as well as in stroma and glands [ 29 ] . TNC also exhibited increasing expression during the culture period , which may be due to the role of this protein in regulating cell adhesion . It also influ - ences proliferation and interacts with fibronectin , integrin and growth factors . Tenascin C is known to be expressed in embryos , especially at regions of branching morphogenesis or epithelial - mesenchy - mal interactions , and in adults in stem cell niches and in inflammation sites [ 30 ] . Its upregulation may contribute to cell migration and tube formation , suggesting that TNC is another important factor en - gaged in oviductal development . Furthermore , Te - nascin C may act via integrin ITGB3 gene product , a subunit of a platelet membrane adhesive receptor complex GP IIb / IIIa , which also exhibited upregula - tion during our studies . TNC and ITGB3 interaction has been described e . g . in breast cancer cells , where it resulted in FAK / Akt - 473 pathway activation and cell migration [ 31 ] . In this case , such interaction may indicate tube forming activity in OECs , as in - tegrin - mediated signaling pathway is known to be involved in epithelial apicobasal polarization – a crucial event in tubal development [ 6 ] . Apart from ITGB3 - Tenascin C interaction , there is also a possible functional interaction between ITGB3 and DAB2 ( Fig . 6 . ) , expression of which is upregulat - ed in OECs culture , reaching the highest level on day 30 . DAB2 is known to be involved in correct female reproductive tract functioning , as it is expressed in normal ovarian epithelial cells [ 32 ] . Hocevar et al . [ 33 ] demonstrated its important role in TGFβ sig - naling pathway , where it serves as a bridge between TGFβ receptors and Smad proteins and the study on bone marrow derived macrophages has shown that DAB2 induces cell adhesion and spreading [ 34 ] . These results indicate this protein’s important role in multiple signaling pathways and here we show its involvement in oviductal epithelium morphogene - sis as well . The transcription factors’ role in OECs develop - ment also must be addressed , as they positively or negatively regulate many downstream genes’ ex - pression . For example , PAX2 is a transcription factor known to be involved in oviduct morphogenesis and is expressed in normal OECs [ 35 ] . However , we have observed a significant upregulation in other tran - scription factors’ expression : HHEX and EPAS1 , both engaged in endothelial cell development [ 36 , 37 ] . HHEX is a transcription factor present in e . g . he - matopoietic lineages [ 36 ] , liver , thyroid and lungs [ 38 ] . In OECs long term in vitro culture it main - tained relatively similar level on day 7 , 15 and 30 . This protein is known regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation – in prostatic and breast can - cer cells its upregulation resulted in decreased cell migration by endoglin expression regulation [ 39 ] . HHEX is engaged in many developmental processes , including liver , heart , thyroid and pancreatic devel - opment [ 38 ] and our findings suggest that it may also be involved in oviductal morphogenesis . EPAS1 , on the other hand , is a gene encoding HIF2A , a tran - scription factor involved in gene expression under hypoxic conditions [ 37 ] and we observed its highest level on day 30 of OEC’s culture . EPAS1 is expressed in highly vascularized tissues and endothelial cells , thus its role in vasculogenesis has been suggested [ 37 ] . However its involvement in oviduct develop - ment has not yet been reported . We have also observed differential expression of enzyme - coding genes – LOX and ARG1 , where LOX ’s expression has risen gradually during in vitro cul - ture and ARG1 was upregulated on day 7 . LOX initi - ates crosslinking of collagen and elastin and plays a role in stabilization of extracellular matrix [ 40 ] . Thus , it is expressed in tissues containing collagen or elastic fibers and is crucial for their stability . Apart from that , it binds with TGFβ1 and affects its signaling [ 41 ] . Therefore , it is an another com - ponent of multifunctional signaling pathway up - regulated during this study . The study on gastric cancer cells indicates that LOX is involved in epithe - lial - mesenchymal transition under hypoxic condi - tions [ 42 ] and increases cellular proliferation , mi - gration and invasion in endometrial epithelial cells [ 43 ] . Therefore , it is possible that it acts in a similar manner in OECs . The other aforementioned gene , ARG1 , encodes arginase , which is well known to be involved in urea cycle and is expressed in the liver [ 44 ] . Apart from that , it had been demonstrated that its upregulation increases rat aortic smooth muscle cells proliferation [ 45 ] . Arginase I expression also occurs in highly regenerative mice tissues and pro - vides necessary polyamine synthesis for effective development [ 46 ] . Therefore , we might suspect that it also affects initial steps of OEC morphogenesis . Stefańska et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 203 SLIT proteins are known regulators of cell migra - tion and apoptosis and their expression has already been reported in human and sheep ovaries [ 47 ] , human endometrium and oviductal epithelial cells . It is suspected that these proteins negatively regu - late a tubal embryo implantation , however there are further studies needed to test this hypothesis [ 48 ] . SLIT2 connection with tubular development in duc - tal morphogenesis of mammary glands has already been investigated [ 49 ] , which might be a reason why we have observed its increased expression on day 30 of OECs in vitro culture . Taken together , our findings show that oviductal epithelial cells actively proliferate after long term in vitro culture . We have observed a significant in - crease in expression of genes belonging to “tube morphogenesis” , “tube development” , “morphogen - esis of an epithelium” , “morphogenesis of branch - ing structure” and “morphogenesis of branching epithelium” GO BP terms , which suggests that OECs maintain their tube forming properties . The cur - rent knowledge on epithelial tubular development comes mostly from studies on MDCK kidney cells and breast MCF10A cells [ 6 ] and here we provide a novel insight into this process in porcine oviductal epithelial cells .
