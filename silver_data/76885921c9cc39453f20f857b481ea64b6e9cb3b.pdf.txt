Introduction Basement membrane is a thin , dense , sheet - like matrix that un - derlies or surrounds most tissues ( Hohenester and Yurchenco , 2013 ) . Cell invasion through basement membrane occurs in many normal and pathological processes , including embryo implanta - tion , gastrulation , leukocyte trafficking , and cancer metastasis ( Rowe and Weiss , 2008 ; Hagedorn and Sherwood , 2011 ) . Be - cause of its small pore size and cross - linked organization , cells are thought to require specialized mechanisms to transmigrate basement membrane ( Madsen and Sahai , 2010 ) . In particular , protrusive F - actin – based membrane structures , termed invadopo - dia , have been proposed to be critical for breaching basement membrane ( Condeelis and Segall , 2003 ) . Although extensively studied in transformed cells and cancer lines in vitro , the regula - tion of invadopodia in vivo has been difficult to establish due to the challenge of examining invasion in an intact organism ( Beerling et al . , 2011 ; Saltel et al . , 2011 ) . Anchor cell ( AC ) invasion in Caenorhabditis elegans is a simple model of basement membrane transmigration that combines genetic analysis and imaging of the invasive cell – basement membrane interface ( Hagedorn and Sherwood , 2011 ) . The AC is a specialized uterine cell that invades through base - ment membrane to connect the developing uterine and vulval tis - sues during development ( Sherwood and Sternberg , 2003 ) . We have recently shown that F - actin – based AC invadopodia presage and then occupy the initial breach in the basement membrane ( Hagedorn et al . , 2013 ) . Several actin regulators , including the C . elegans orthologue of Ena / VASP , UNC - 34 , and the membrane - associated Rac GTPases , MIG - 2 and CED - 10 , localize to AC invadopodia . Animals harboring mutations in these genes have mild defects in invasion , suggesting these proteins are subtle modulators of invadopodia ( Ziel et al . , 2009 ) . Proteins of the actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin family regulate actin filament dynamics through their F - actin – severing activity , promotion of filament depolymerization , and ability to regulate nucleation ( Carlier et al . , 1999 ; Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ; Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ; Bernstein and Bamburg , 2010 ) . In vitro studies have suggested that cofilin can promote either F - actin assembly or disassembly depending on I nvadopodia are protrusive , F - actin – driven membrane structures that are thought to mediate basement mem - brane transmigration during development and tumor dissemination . An understanding of the mechanisms regulating invadopodia has been hindered by the diffi - culty of examining these dynamic structures in native en - vironments . Using an RNAi screen and live - cell imaging of anchor cell ( AC ) invasion in Caenorhabditis elegans , we have identified UNC - 60A ( ADF / cofilin ) as an essen - tial regulator of invadopodia . UNC - 60A localizes to AC invadopodia , and its loss resulted in a dramatic slowing of F - actin dynamics and an inability to breach basement membrane . Optical highlighting indicated that UNC - 60A disassembles actin filaments at invadopodia . Surprisingly , loss of unc - 60a led to the accumulation of invadopodial membrane and associated components within the en - dolysosomal compartment . Photobleaching experiments revealed that during normal invasion the invadopodial membrane undergoes rapid recycling through the en - dolysosome . Together , these results identify the invado - podial membrane as a specialized compartment whose recycling to form dynamic , functional invadopodia is de - pendent on localized F - actin disassembly by ADF / cofilin .

To deter - mine if ADF / cofilin functions within the AC , we generated a con - struct in which the unc - 60 ( ADF / cofilin ) transcript from the related nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae was expressed specif - ically in the AC ( cdh - 3 > GFP : : Cbrunc - 60 ) . The C . briggsae unc - 60 and C . elegans unc - 60a genes share 83 % nucleotide iden - tity over the conserved first four exons ( nucleotides 1 – 427 of C . elegans unc - 60a ) , which is below the 95 % threshold required for RNAi targeting ( Rual et al . , 2007 ) . cdh - 3 > GFP : : Cbrunc - 60 restored invasion in animals treated with C . elegans unc - 60a RNAi ( Fig . 1 C ; n = 72 / 86 [ 84 % ] normal invasion , 12 / 86 [ 14 % ] partial invasion , 2 / 86 [ 2 % ] no invasion ) . Hence , UNC - 60A pro - motes AC invasion cell autonomously . UNC - 60A ( ADF / cofilin ) localizes to AC invadopodia To visualize the subcellular localization of UNC - 60A , we gen - erated animals with AC - specific GFP : : UNC - 60A expression ( cdh - 3 > GFP : : unc - 60a ) . GFP : : UNC - 60A localized in punctate structures at the AC – basement membrane interface before inva - sion ( Fig . 1 D ) . To determine whether these structures were inva - dopodia , we examined their localization relative to F - actin and basement membrane breaching . We observed a tight correlation between F - actin localization and UNC - 60A enrichment at the AC – basement membrane interface ( Fig . 1 D ) , as well as localiza - tion to the invadopodium that breached the basement membrane ( 5 / 5 animals ; Fig . 1 E ) . Further , UNC - 60A localization to the AC – basement membrane interface was dependent on the integrin INA - 1 / PAT - 3 , whose activity is required for invasion and pro - motes the localization of other invadopodia constituents ( Fig . 1 F ; Hagedorn et al . , 2009 , 2013 ) . Thus , UNC - 60A is a component of AC invadopodia . UNC - 60A promotes F - actin turnover at AC invadopodia To determine whether UNC - 60A regulates AC invadopodia , we examined F - actin within the AC after loss of unc - 60a . In unc - 60a ( RNAi ) animals we observed a twofold expansion in the total volume and amount of the F - actin network at the AC – basement membrane interface , suggesting UNC - 60A promotes actin fila - ment turnover ( Fig . 2 A ) . Although F - actin remained polarized , it was no longer organized into discrete foci and instead formed larger structures that failed to penetrate basement membrane ( Fig . 2 B ) . Compared with F - actin structures in wild - type ACs , which had a median diameter of 0 . 96 µm , in the absence of ADF / cofilin , F - actin structures had a median size of 1 . 90 µm ( n = 30 structures from 10 animals for each ; P < 0 . 0001 ) . These larger F - actin structures were also more stable . In 20 - min time - lapse movies of wild - type animals ( n = 4 animals ) , the average lifetime of invadopodia was only 88 s ( Fig . 2 D ; n = 307 structures exam - ined ) . In contrast , in unc - 60a ( RNAi ) ACs ( n = 10 animals ) , most F - actin structures ( n = 43 / 51 ) persisted for the entire time - lapse ( 20 min ; Fig . 2 C and Videos 1 – 3 ) . This duration far exceeded that of invadopodia in wild - type animals that are associated with basement membrane breaching events ( Fig . 2 D ; average lifetime of 6 . 3 min ; n = 10 invadopodia from 8 animals ) . its concentration relative to actin and other actin - binding pro - teins ( Carlier et al . , 1999 ; Van Troys et al . , 2008 ) . Alterations in ADF / cofilin activity affect formation of cellular protrusions , including neurite and lamellipodia extensions , and influence cell migration ( Chen et al . , 2001 ; Gungabissoon and Bamburg , 2003 ; Ghosh et al . , 2004 ; Hotulainen et al . , 2005 ; Kiuchi et al . , 2007 ) . Consistent with a possible role in cell invasion , cofilin is highly expressed in numerous metastatic cancers and tumor cell lines and promotes invadopodia stability in rat MTLn3 mam - mary tumor cells ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2005 ; Wang et al . , 2007 ) . Despite many studies , it remains unclear whether ADF / cofilin proteins primarily regulate actin assembly or disassembly dur - ing protrusive cellular activity ( Van Troys et al . , 2008 ) . More - over , it is unknown if ADF / cofilin proteins regulate invadopodia in vivo . We find here that the C . elegans ADF / cofilin orthologue UNC - 60A is expressed within the AC , localizes to AC invado - podia , and is required for AC invasion . RNAi - mediated deple - tion of the unc - 60a transcript caused a reduction in F - actin disassembly , resulting in a pronounced expansion in F - actin at AC invadopodia . Strikingly , loss of unc - 60a caused a specific disruption in the trafficking of the invadopodial membrane from the endolysosome to the invasive cell membrane , inhibiting in - vadopodia formation . Together our findings indicate that ADF / cofilin is a critical regulator of invadopodia in vivo , and support a model where ADF / cofilin directs localized F - actin filament turnover that promotes the trafficking of invadopodial membrane to the plasma membrane . Results UNC - 60A ( ADF / cofilin ) is a critical cell - autonomous regulator of AC invasion Recent work has shown that invadopodia form within the C . ele - gans uterine AC and mediate basement membrane penetration as the AC invades the vulval tissue ( Fig . 1 A ; Hagedorn et al . , 2013 ) . To identify direct regulators of AC invadopodia , we examined genes identified in a whole - genome RNAi screen for AC invasion ( Matus et al . , 2010 ) . Of these , we noted that loss of unc - 60a , one of two isoforms of the C . elegans orthologue of the ADF / cofilin gene ( McKim et al . , 1994 ; Anyanful et al . , 2004 ) , resulted in one of the most penetrant AC invasion defects . An expanded analysis of RNAi - mediated knockdown of unc - 60a confirmed this find - ing , revealing a 90 % AC invasion defect ( Fig . 1 B ; n = 14 / 140 [ 10 % ] normal invasion , 54 / 140 [ 39 % ] partial invasion , 72 / 140 [ 51 % ] no invasion ; see Materials and methods for scoring de - tails ) . unc - 60 ( su158 ) mutants , which are null for the muscle - specific isoform unc - 60b , have normal AC invasion ( Ono et al . , 1999 ; Ono et al . , 2003 ; Ziel et al . , 2009 ) , indicating that the unc - 60a isoform regulates AC invasion . To examine where unc - 60a ( ADF / cofilin ) is expressed , we generated a translational GFP : : UNC - 60A fusion protein under the control of its endogenous promoter ( unc - 60 > GFP : : unc - 60a ) . At the time of invasion GFP : : UNC - 60A was present throughout the uterine tissue and at elevated levels in the AC ( Fig . 1 C ; 1 . 35 - fold greater levels versus neighboring uterine cells ; n = 11 animals examined ) . GFP : : UNC - 60A was also more enriched at on A p r il 25 , 2016 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published March 24 , 2014 1211 Cofilin promotes invadopodia formation in vivo • Hagedorn et al . region of actin ( F - actin and likely a small portion of G - actin ) at the invasive cell membrane where invadopodia reside ( Fig . 3 A ) . In control animals , optically highlighted actin began redistribut - ing immediately and spread throughout the AC by 30 min , consis - tent with rapid F - actin turnover ( Fig . 3 , A and B ; n = 5 / 5 ACs ) . In contrast , after loss of unc - 60a , optically highlighted actin did not disperse significantly , even after 30 min ( Fig . 3 , A and B ; n = 4 / 4 To test if the accumulation of F - actin resulted from reduced F - actin disassembly , we created animals that expressed an actin isoform tagged with Dendra2 in the AC . Dendra2 is a photocon - vertible fluorophore that switches from green to red fluorescence after brief exposure to 405 - nm light ( Gurskaya et al . , 2006 ) . We treated the Dendra2 : : ACT - 1 animals with either unc - 60a RNAi or an empty vector control and then photoconverted a small Figure 1 .

AC invasion is precisely timed with underlying VPC development , and initiates breach of the basement membrane during the P6 . p two - cell stage and completes basement membrane clearance by the P6 . p four - cell stage ( Hagedorn et al . , 2013 ) .

Instead , these molecules were localized within intra - cellular vesicles ( Fig . 4 , B and E ) . Colocalization analysis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and MIG - 2 indicated that these molecules were within overlapping vesicles ( Fig . 4 C ) , suggesting there is coordinated trafficking of invadopodial membrane to the plasma membrane regulated by UNC - 60A . To better understand invadopodial membrane trafficking , we examined markers for the early ( Rab5 ) , late ( Rab7 ) , and re - cycling ( Rab11 ) endosomes , and the endolysosome ( LMP - 1 and CUP - 5 ; Balklava et al . , 2007 ; Campbell and Fares , 2010 ; Humphries et al . , 2011 ) .

Taken together , these results offer compelling evidence that UNC - 60A ( ADF / cofilin ) regulates disassembly of F - actin within AC invadopodia .

Consistent with localization to the actin cytoskeleton ( Trichet et al . , 2008 ) , the actin regulator UNC - 34 ( Ena / VASP ) was distributed throughout the large F - actin aggregates that formed after loss of unc - 60a ( Fig . 4 , A and E ) .

S3 , and Video 4 ) . Time - lapse analysis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 also confirmed these vesicles were more static ( Fig . 5 B and Video 5 ) . We conclude that UNC - 60A promotes dynamic invadopodial membrane recycling from the endolysosome to the plasma membrane . Other polarized trafficking and secretion events are normal after loss of unc - 60a To determine whether the disruption in invadopodial membrane trafficking was an indirect effect from a general perturbation in vesicle trafficking or polarity , we examined markers of polarity and secretion . Notably , after depletion of unc - 60a the integrin re - ceptor INA - 1 / PAT - 3 and the netrin receptor UNC - 40 ( DCC ) were polarized normally to the AC’s invasive cell membrane ( Fig . 6 , A and D ; Hagedorn et al . , 2009 ; Ziel et al . , 2009 ) . Further , AC deposition of the matrix component hemicentin into the basement membrane ( Fig . 6 , B and D ; Sherwood et al . , 2005 ) and secretion of the EGF - like ligand LIN - 3 , which induces vulval development , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , CED - 10 , and MIG - 2 colocalized strongly with LMP - 1 at invadopodia and LMP - 1 localized to the invadopodium at the site of breach ( Fig . 4 D ) . Further , using fluorescence loss in photobleaching ( FLIP ) , we found that repeated photobleaching of a small 1 . 0 - µm region of the invasive cell membrane resulted in loss of LMP - 1 : : GFP throughout the endolysosome within 5 min , indicating dynamic recycling of the invadopodial mem - brane through this compartment ( Fig . 5 A , Fig . S3 , and Video 4 ) . Time - lapse analysis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 confirmed active invadopodial membrane dynamics at the invasive cell membrane ( Fig . 5 B and Video 5 ) . Together , these results indicate that the invadopo - dial membrane recycles through the endolysosome during inva - dopodia formation . The accumulation of invadopodial membrane in internal vesicles after loss of unc - 60a and recycling through the endolyso - some suggested that UNC - 60A might regulate the trafficking of invadopodial membrane through this compartment . Consistent with this notion , after loss of unc - 60a , the invadopodial membrane marker PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 colocalized with the endolysosome marker LMP - 1 within internalized vesicles ( Fig . 4 D ) .

Our live - cell imaging and site - of - action studies indicate that UNC - 60A specifically localizes to AC invadopodia and func - tions within the AC to promote breaching the basement mem - brane . The increased accumulation of F - actin and dramatically decreased actin turnover after loss of unc - 60a indicate that UNC - 60A promotes F - actin disassembly at invadopodia , rather than nucleating new actin filaments . Our data add weight to the notion that in most cell types ADF / cofilin contributes to actin dynamics primarily by mediating actin filament disassembly ( Hotulainen et al . , 2005 ; Kiuchi et al . , 2007 ; Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ; Lai et al . , 2008 ) . In the C . elegans AC , F - actin disassembly might be were normal ( Fig . 6 C ) . These results offer strong evidence that UNC - 60A does not regulate general polarity or secretion in the AC . Discussion Invadopodia , protrusive F - actin – based membrane structures capa - ble of ECM remodeling , were identified in transformed cells and cancer lines in vitro over 20 years ago ( Chen , 1989 ) . Despite in - tense interest , the regulation and function of invadopodia in vivo has been elusive ( Beerling et al . , 2011 ; Murphy and Courtneidge , 2011 ) . Our data indicate that the C . elegans ADF / cofilin orthologue UNC - 60A is a critical and specific regulator of invadopodia during AC invasion . We find that UNC - 60A mediates F - actin disassembly Figure 4 . UNC - 60A ( ADF / cofilin ) regulates the invadopodial membrane .

Mahaffey et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , targeted F - actin turnover by UNC - 60A at AC invadopodia might direct trafficking of invadopodial membrane from the endolysosome to discrete sites to form inva - dopodia . Cofilin has also been implicated in other trafficking events within cells , including sorting at the trans - Golgi network and endocytic trafficking to the yeast vacuole ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ; von Blume et al . , 2009 ) . In the trans - Golgi , cofilin is proposed to mediate trimming of F - actin , which allows the transmembrane Ca 2 + ATPase SPCA1 to import Ca 2 + into the lumen to direct proper sorting ( von Blume et al . , 2011 ) . During endocytic delivery of vesicles to the yeast vacuole , cofilin is re - quired to disassemble F - actin from the endocytic vesicles and re - generate the actin monomer pool , both of which might be required for late endocytic targeting or fusion with the vacuole ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . It is thus possible that cofilin might regulate aspects of invadopodial membrane targeting , fusion , or sorting at the endolysosome itself that are required for trafficking back to the invasive membrane to form invadopodia . Given the tight lo - calization of cofilin to invadopodia at the invasive cell membrane , however , we favor the notion that cofilin has a direct role in tar - geting invadopodial membrane to nascent invadopodia . Taken together , our results establish a unique organizing function for UNC - 60A ( cofilin ) at invadopodia , coordinating both protrusive F - actin formation and invadopodial membrane addition . Vertebrate ADF / cofilin proteins are overexpressed in many cancers and mediate invadopodia maturation in an adenocar - cinoma cell line ( Wang et al . , 2007 ) . The results of our func - tional in vivo studies here strongly support the notion that ADF / cofilin proteins are conserved regulators of invadopodia in both normal and pathological processes . Further , the specific defect in AC invadopodia formation and strong perturbation in ability to invade suggests that targeting ADF / cofilin activity might be an effective strategy to block invasion in diseases such as cancer . necessary for breaking down existing AC invadopodia and form - ing new invadopodia through the recycling of actin monomers . Dynamic F - actin turnover at AC invadopodia is also likely critical to generate the protrusive force required to breach basement membrane . Consistent with this idea , ADF / cofilin proteins are thought to generate actin monomers to promote lamellipodial ex - tensions in Cos and MCF7 cell lines and migration in NIH 3T3 and B16F1 cells ( Hotulainen et al . , 2005 ; Kiuchi et al . , 2007 ) . Ultrastructural analysis and TIRF microscopy have indi - cated that invadopodia in tumor cells have a dynamic , morpho - logically unique membrane ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ; Artym et al . , 2011 ) . Studies on the trafficking of invadopodial membrane com - ponents in cell culture have focused on the membrane - anchored matrix metalloproteinase MT1 - MMP ( Poincloux et al . , 2009 ) . Intriguingly , recent work in tumor cells has indicated that MT1 - MMP is recycled from the endolysosomal compartment to the plasma membrane ( Hoshino et al . , 2012 ; Yu et al . , 2012 ) . Our studies indicate that the invadopodial membrane is a unique com - partment , which is actively recycled through the endolysosome in an UNC - 60A ( ADF / cofilin ) – dependent manner ( Fig . 5 E ) . Traf - ficking through the endolysosome might facilitate dynamic mem - brane addition to invadopodia required for active protrusions , similar to roles of endolysosome membrane addition in wound healing and neurite outgrowth ( Reddy et al . , 2001 ; Arantes and Andrews , 2006 ) . Active membrane movement through the en - dolysosome may also be required for delivery of proteases to AC invadopodia ( Yu et al . , 2012 ) . Spatially restricted cofilin activity is necessary for vesicular trafficking of acetylcholine receptors to nascent postsynaptic sites as well as planar cell polarity proteins to apical membranes in the mouse embryo ( Lee et al . , 2009 ; Mahaffey et al . , 2013 ) . It is thought that localized F - actin turnover by ADF / cofilin facilitates vesicle targeting or fusion to the plasma membrane , perhaps by breaking the cortical actin barrier ( Eitzen , 2003 ; Lee et al . , 2009 ; Figure 5 . UNC - 60A promotes invadopodial membrane recycling through the endolyso - some . ( A ) Focused laser photobleaching of an  1 . 0 - µm region at the invasive membrane ( circle ) in a wild - type AC ( top row ) resulted in loss of the endolysosome LMP - 1 : : GFP sig - nal throughout the AC shortly after two and a half minutes ( time points , minutes ) . Note , these images were captured on a laser - scanning microscope optimized for FLIP analysis , which has reduced sensitivity for LMP - 1 : : GFP signal compared with the spinning - disk confocal image captured in Fig . 4 D ( see Materials and methods ) . In unc - 60a ( RNAi ) animals the LMP - 1 : : GFP signal persisted  10 min after initiation of photobleaching . Graphs report LMP - 1 : : GFP signal remaining in neighboring nonbleached invasive membrane over time ( n ≥ 5 animals each genotype ; P < 0 . 01 for 25 % , and P < 0 . 05 for 50 and 75 % signal - ing remaining ; Student’s t test ) .

Acquired images were processed using ImageJ 1 . 40g ( National In - stitutes of Health ) and Photoshop ( CS6 Extended ; Adobe Systems , Inc . ) . 3D reconstructions were built from confocal Z - stacks , analyzed , and exported as . MOV files using IMARIS 7 . 4 ( Bitplane , Inc . ) . Figures and graphs were constructed using Illustrator ( CS6 Extended ; Adobe Systems , Inc . ) . Videos were annotated using Photoshop . Scoring of AC invasion , fluorescence intensity , colocalization , and polarity AC invasion was scored as previously described using DIC microscopy ( Sherwood et al . , 2005 ) . In brief , animals were scored for invasion at the P6 . p four - cell stage when basement membrane clearance is completed in wild - type animals . ACs were scored as “normal invasion” if the breach in the basement membrane was at least the width of the AC by the P6 . p four - cell stage , “partial invasion” if there was a visible breach smaller than the width of the AC , and “no invasion” if there was no detectible breach in the basement membrane . For analysis of UNC - 60A up - regulation in the AC , regions of interest were drawn in ImageJ around the AC and then a neigh - boring uterine cell in the same animal ; mean fluorescence intensity of each cell was then determined . Up - regulation was calculated as the following ratio : [ AC mean intensity – background ] / [ neighboring uterine cell mean intensity – background ] . Colocalization analysis was performed on confocal Materials and methods Strains and culture conditions C . elegans were cultured as described previously ( Brenner , 1974 ) and wild - type were strain N2 .

The lmp - 1 : : GFP , GFP : : cup - 5 , mCherry : : rab - 5 , mCherry : : rab - 7 , and mCherry : : rab - 11 reporters were amplified from plasmid DNA ( see Table S2 ) and linked to the cdh - 3 > promoter by PCR fusion .

In brief , a mask was first used to exclude all signal outside of the AC . Pearson’s correlation coeffi - cient was then calculated from the GFP and mCherry fluorescence inside the AC ( n ≥ 5 animals for each comparison ) . All images were acquired using identical settings . Polarity in wild - type animals and animals treated with unc - 60a RNAi was determined using the ratio of the mean fluores - cence intensity from a 5 - pixel - wide line scan drawn along the invasive and apicolateral membranes of ACs and in some cases neighboring uterine cells expressing unc - 60 > GFP : : unc - 60a , GFP : : MIG - 2 , GFP : : CED - 10 , LMP - 1 : : GFP , mCherry : : PLC  PH , mCherry : : RAB - 5 , mCherry : : RAB - 7 , mCherry : : RAB - 11 , GFP : : CUP - 5 , PAT - 3 : : GFP , and UNC - 40 : : GFP . Numbers examined for each are indicated in the text or figure legends . Polarity was calculated as the follow - ing ratio : [ invasive membrane mean intensity  background ] / [ apicolateral membrane mean intensity  background ] . Scoring of F - actin volume and dynamics Quantitative F - actin measurements were performed as described previously ( Hagedorn et al . , 2009 ) . In brief , confocal Z - stacks were used to make 3D reconstructions of F - actin networks in ACs expressing the F - actin probe mCherry : : moeABD using Imaris 6 . 0 ( Bitplane , Inc . ) . Isosurface renderings of mCherry : : moeABD were created setting a threshold that outlined the dense F - actin network at the invasive membrane in wild - type ACs . This same thresh - olding was used in cdh - 3 > mCherry : : moeABD - untreated and unc - 60a RNAi - treated animals . Quantitative measurements were then made for the volume and amount of fluorescence intensity with these isosurface renderings ( n ≥ 10 animals for each ) . Similar methods were used to quantify GFP : : UNC - 34 and hemicentin : : GFP volumes . Quantitative measurements of the total ( sum ) fluorescence of mCherry : : moeABD present in the AC showed no change after treatment with unc - 60a RNAi ( n = 10 animals each ; P = 0 . 91 ; Student’s t test ) . AC invadopodia dynamics were quantified using the “Spots” module within Imaris , which facilitated the tracking of F - actin patches ( cdh - 3 > mCherry : : moeABD ) at the invasive membrane of the AC over time in wild - type and unc - 60a RNAi - treated animals . Optical highlighting and fluorescence loss in photobleaching ( FLIP ) Imaging was conducted with a laser - scanning confocal microscope ( LSM 510 ; Carl Zeiss ) equipped with a 100× objective ( 1 . 4 NA ) . The PMT light detector used on the laser - scanning microscope is less sensitive in detecting fluorescence than the CCD camera on the spinning - disk confocal micro - scope ( Murray et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , optimization to achieve numeri - cal data for FLIP analysis on the laser - scanning confocal microscope resulted in a reduced signal - to - noise ratio . These features underlie the dif - ferences in the images shown in Fig . 3 A and Fig . 5 A and Fig . S3 cap - tured using the laser - scanning microscope versus all other fluorescence images that were captured on a spinning - disk confocal microscope . Trans - genic cdh - 3 > Dendra2 : : act - 1 worms were photoconverted by scanning re - gions of interest ( ROIs ;  1 µm ) with a 405 - nm laser at 2 % power for 100 iterations . Images were captured before , immediately after , and 30 min after conversion . To quantify redistribution of optically highlighted actin ( an estimate of F - actin turnover ) , ImageJ was used to measure the mean fluores - cence intensity of the converted green - to - red ROI and the remaining area of the AC outside the ROI . The fold enrichment of red signal ( 561 - nm exci - tation wavelength ) was measured as follows : [ ROI background ] / [ outside ROI background ] . For FILP , selected ROIs (  1 µm ) of the AC in worms ex - pressing cdh - 3 > LMP - 1 : : GFP were bleached every 30 s for 10 min at 100 % power for 20 iterations , and images were taken before and after each beaching interval . Quantitative data were obtained with ImageJ by normalizing background - subtracted mean intensities to t = 0 of the LMP - 1 : : GFP signal at the invasive membrane adjacent to the bleached ROI . For each technique , identical settings were used to acquire images at all time - points and ≥5 animals were analyzed in each group . RNAi RNAi targeting pat - 3 and unc - 60a was delivered by RNAi feeding ( Sherwood et al . , 2005 ) . To bypass embryonic lethality , synchronized L1 - stage larvae were plated on unc - 60a RNAi , and synchronized L2 - stage larvae were plated on pat - 3 RNAi as described previously ( Hagedorn et al . , 2009 ) . The empty RNAi vector L4440 was used as the wild - type control . Construction of GFP protein fusions The GFP : : unc - 60a fusions were constructed by placing GFP immediately after the unc - 60a start codon and 1 . 9 kb downstream of the stop codon was included as the 3  UTR . The GFP : : UNC - 60 amplicon was linked by PCR fu - sion to promoters , either endogenous ( fragment encompassing 3 . 6 kb up - stream of the unc - 60 start codon , unc - 60 > GFP : : unc - 60a ) or AC specific ( cdh - 3 > promoter , cdh - 3 > GFP : : unc - 60a ) .
