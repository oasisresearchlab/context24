By using 32 VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water - vapor condensation principle , material was collected 33 from room air and subjected to RT - qPCR and virus culture . The genomes of the SARS - CoV - 2 collected 34 from the air and of virus isolated in cell culture from air sampling and from a NP swab from a newly 35 admitted patient in the room were sequenced . 36 Findings Viable virus was isolated from air samples collected 2 to 4 . 8m away from the patients . The 37 genome sequence of the SARS - CoV - 2 strain isolated from the material collected by the air samplers was 38 identical to that isolated from the NP swab from the patient with an active infection . Estimates of viable 39 viral concentrations ranged from 6 to 74 TCID 50 units / L of air . 40 Interpretation Patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID - 19 produce aerosols in the absence of 41 aerosol - generating procedures that contain viable SARS - CoV - 2 , and these aerosols may serve as a source 42 of transmission of the virus . 43 Funding Partly funded by Grant No . 2030844 from the National Science Foundation and by award 44 1R43ES030649 from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences of the National Institutes of 45 Health , and by funds made available by the University of Florida Emerging Pathogens Institute and the 46 Office of the Dean , University of Florida College of Medicine . 47 48 49 50 51 52 3 Research in context 53 Evidence before this study 54 Various studies report detection of SARS - CoV - 2 in material collected by air samplers positioned in 55 clinics and in some public spaces . For those studies , detection of SARS - CoV - 2 has been by indirect 56 means ; instead of virus isolation , the presence of the virus in material collected by air samplers has been 57 through RT - PCR detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . However , questions have been raised about the clinical 58 significance of detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA , particularly as airborne viruses are often inactivated by 59 exposure to UV light , drying , and other environmental conditions , and inactivated SARS - CoV - 2 cannot 60 cause COVID - 19 . 61 Added value of this study 62 Our virus isolation work provides direct evidence that SARS - CoV - 2 in aerosols can be viable and thus 63 pose a risk for transmission of the virus . Furthermore , we show a clear progression of virus - induced 64 cytopathic effects in cell culture , and demonstrate that the recovered virus can be serially propagated . 65 Moreover , we demonstrate an essential link : the viruses we isolated in material collected in four air 66 sampling runs and the virus in a newly admitted symptomatic patient in the room were identical . These 67 findings strengthen the notion that airborne transmission of viable SARS - CoV - 2 is likely and plays a 68 critical role in the spread of COVID - 19 . 69 Implications of all the available evidence 70 Scientific information on the mode of transmission should guide best practices Current best practices for 71 limiting the spread of COVID - 19 . Transmission secondary to aerosols , without the need for an aerosol - 72 generating procedure , especially in closed spaces and gatherings , has been epidemiologically linked to 73 exposures and outbreaks . For aerosol - based transmission , measures such as physical distancing by 6 feet 74 would not be helpful in an indoor setting and would provide a false - sense of security . With the current 75 surges of cases , to help stem the COVID - 19 pandemic , clear guidance on control measures against SARS - 76 CoV - 2 aerosols are needed . 77 78 4 Introduction 79 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , genus Betacoronavirus , subgenus 80 Sarbecovirus , family Coronaviridae , is a positive - polarity single - stranded RNA virus that probably 81 originated in bats 1 – 3 and is the causative agent of coronavirus disease of 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) . 4 The 82 dynamics of the COVID - 19 pandemic have proven to be complex . Many challenges remain pertaining to 83 a better understanding of the epidemiology , pathology , and transmission of COVID - 19 . For example , the 84 clinical manifestations of COVID - 19 range from an asymptomatic infection , mild respiratory illness to 85 pneumonia , respiratory failure , multi - organ failure , and death . 5 - 7 Diarrhea due to gastro - intestinal 86 infection can also occur , and in vitro modeling suggests that the virus infects human gut enterocytes . 8 87 SARS - CoV - 2 RNA can be found in rectal swabs and fecal aerosols , even after nasal - pharyngeal testing 88 has turned negative , 9 - 12 suggesting that a fecal – oral transmission route may be possible . 89 To - date , there has been a strong emphasis on the role of respiratory droplets and fomites in the 90 transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . 13 , 14 Yet SARS - CoV - 2 does not appear to be exclusively inhaled as a 91 droplet , and epidemiologic data are consistent with aerosol transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . 15 - 19 92 Furthermore , SARS - CoV - 2 genomic RNA has been detected in airborne material collected by air 93 samplers positioned distal to COVID - 19 patients . 9 , 20 - 23 Any respiratory virus that can survive 94 aerosolization poses an inhalation biohazard risk , and van Doremalen et al . 24 experimentally generated 95 aerosol particles with SARS - CoV - 2 and found that the virus remained viable during a three - hour testing 96 period . More recently , Fears et al . 25 reported that the virus retained infectivity and integrity for up to 16 97 hours in laboratory - created respirable - sized aerosols . Nevertheless , finding virus RNA in material 98 collected by an air sampler may not correlate with risk . Indeed , the air we breathe is full of viruses 99 ( animal , plant , bacterial , human , etc . ) , yet a large proportion of the viruses in air are non - viable due to 100 UV - inactivation , drying , etc . , and non - viable viruses cannot cause illnesses . Because efforts to isolate 101 virus in cell cultures in the aforementioned air sampling studies in hospital wards were not made , 20 , 22 or 102 failed when they were attempted due to overgrowth by faster replicating respiratory viruses , 23 or provided 103 5 weak evidence of virus isolation , 21 uncertainties about the role of aerosols in COVID - 19 transmission 104 remain . 105 It is well known that virus particles collected by various air samplers become inactivated during the air 106 sampling process , 26 and if such is the case for SARS - CoV - 2 , this partly explains why it has been difficult 107 to prove that SARS - CoV - 2 collected from aerosols is viable . Because we previously collected SARS - 108 CoV - 2 from the air of a respiratory illness ward within a clinic but were unable to isolate the virus in cell 109 cultures due to out - competition by other respiratory viruses , 23 we sought to perform air sampling tests in a 110 hospital room reserved for COVID - 19 patients , to lessen the probability of collecting other airborne 111 human respiratory viruses . We thus collected aerosols containing SARS - CoV - 2 in a room housing 112 COVID - 19 patients using our VIVAS air samplers that collect virus particles without damaging them , 113 thus conserving their viability . These samplers operate using a water - vapor condensation mechanism . 27 , 28 114 Air samplings were performed at the University of Florida Health ( UF Health ) Shands Hospital , which is 115 a 1 , 050 - bed teaching hospital situated in Gainesville , Florida . As of 10 July 2020 , > 200 patients have 116 been treated at the hospital for COVID - 19 . The current study was conducted as part of ongoing 117 environmental investigations by the UF Health infection control group to assess possible healthcare 118 worker exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 . 119 120 Methods 121 Detailed methods are provided in a Technical Appendix . An abbreviated summary of methods is 122 provided below : 123 Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval and patients 124 The study protocol was approved by the UF IRB ( study IRB202002102 ) . Patient 1 was a person with 125 coronary artery disease and other co - morbidities who had been transferred from a long - term care facility 126 for COVID - 19 treatment the evening before our air sampling tests were initiated ; he had a positive NP 127 swab test on admission that was positive for SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR . Patient 2 had been admitted four 128 days before the air sampling tests with a mid - brain stroke ; the patient had a positive NP swab test for 129 6 SARS - CoV - 2 on admission , but a repeat test was negative , and the patient was in the process of being 130 discharged at the time the air sampling was being done . 131 Hospital room 132 Air samples were collected in a room that was part of a designated COVID - 19 ward ( Figure 1 ) . The room 133 had six air changes per hour and the exhaust air underwent triple filter treatment ( minimum efficiency 134 reporting value [ MERV ] 14 , 75 % - 85 % efficiency for 0 . 3 µm particles ) , coil condensation ( to remove 135 moisture ) , and UV - C irradiation prior to recycling 90 % of the treated air back to the room . 136 Air samplers and sampling parameters 137 Three serial 3 - hr air samplings were performed using our prototype VIVAS air sampler , 23 , 27 , 28 as well as 138 a BioSpot - VIVAS BSS300P , which is a commercial version of the VIVAS ( available from Aerosol 139 Devices Inc . , Ft . Collins , CO ) . These samplers collect airborne particles using a water - vapor 140 condensation method . 23 , 27 , 28 Two samplers were used so that air could be collected / sampled at different 141 sites of the same room during a given air sampling period . For each sampler , the second of the three 142 samplings was performed with a high efficiency particulate arrestance ( HEPA ) filter affixed to the inlet 143 tube , a process we implement to reveal whether virus detected in consecutive samplings reflect true 144 collection and not detection of residual virus within the collector . The air - samplers were stationed from 2 145 to 4 . 8 m away from the patients ( Figure 1 ) . 146 Detection of SARS - CoV - 2 genomic RNA ( vRNA ) in collection media 147 vRNA was extracted from virions in collection media and purified by using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini 148 Kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) . Twenty - five µL ( final volume ) real - time reverse - transcription 149 polymerase chain reaction ( rtRT - PCR ) tests were performed in a BioRad CFX96 Touch Real - Time PCR 150 Detection System using 5 µL of purified vRNA and rtRT - PCR primers and the probe listed in Table 1 151 that detect a section of the SARS - CoV - 2 N - gene . 23 The N - gene rRT - PCR assay that was used was part of 152 a dual ( N - and RdRp - gene ) rRT - PCR assay designed by J . Lednicky and does not detect common human 153 alpha - or beta - coronaviruses . Using this particular N - gene rRT - PCR detection system , the limit of 154 detection is about 1 . 5 SARS - CoV - 2 genome equivalents per 25 µL rRT - PCR assay . 155 7 Cell lines for virus isolation 156 Cell lines used for the isolation of SARS - CoV - 2 were obtained from the American Type Culture 157 Collection ( ATCC ) and consisted of LLC - MK2 ( Rhesus monkey kidney cells , catalog no . ATCC CCL - 7 ) 158 and Vero E6 cells ( African green monkey kidney cells , catalog no . ATCC CRL - 1586 ) . 159 Isolation of virus in cultured cells 160 Cells grown as monolayers in a T - 25 flask ( growing surface 25 cm 2 ) were inoculated when they were at 161 80 % of confluency . First , aliquots ( 100 µL ) of the concentrated air sampler collection media were filtered 162 through a sterile 0 . 45 µm pore - size PVDV syringe - tip filter to remove bacterial and fungal cells and 163 spores . Next , the spent LLC - MK2 and Vero E6 cell culture medium was removed and replaced with 1 mL 164 of cell culture medium , and the cells inoculated with 50 μ L of cell filtrate . When virus - induced cytopathic 165 effects ( CPE ) were evident , the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 was determined by rRT - PCR . 166 Quantification of SARS - CoV - 2 genomes in sampled air 167 The number of viral genome equivalents present in each sample was estimated from the measured 168 quantification cycle ( Cq ) values . To do so , a 6 - log standard curve was run using 10 - fold dilutions of a 169 calibrated plasmid containing an insert of the SARS - CoV - 2 N - gene that had been obtained from IDT 170 Technologies , Inc . ( Coralville , Iowa ) . The data was fit using equation ( eq . ) 1 : 171 Eq . 1 . y = ( log10GE ) ( a ) + b , where y = Cq value , a = slope of the regression line , log10GE is the base 172 10 log genome equivalents , and b is the intercept of the regression line . 173 Sanger sequencing of SARS - CoV - 2 genomes in material collected by air samplers 174 To obtain the virus consensus sequence prior to possible changes that might occur during isolation of the 175 virus in cell cultures , a direct sequencing approach was used . Because the amount of virus present in the 176 samples was low and thus unsuitable for common next - generation sequencing approaches , Sanger 177 sequencing based on a gene - walking approach with over - lapping primers was used to obtain the virus 178 sequence . 23 179 Next - generation sequencing the genome of SARS - CoV - 2 isolated from NP swab 180 8 The vRNA extracted from virions in spent Vero E6 cell culture medium served as a template to generate a 181 cDNA library using a NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep kit ( New England Biolabs , Inc . ) . Sequencing 182 was performed on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer using a 600 - cycle v3 MiSeq Reagent kit . Following the 183 removal of host sequences ( Chlorocebus sabaeus ; GenBank assembly accession number 184 GCA _ 000409795 . 2 ) using Kraken 2 , 29 de novo assembly of paired - end reads was performed in SPAdes 185 v3 . 13 . 0 with default parameters . 30 186 Results 187 SARS - CoV - 2 genomic RNA ( vRNA ) was detected by real - time reverse transcriptase quantitative 188 polymerase chain reaction ( rRT - qPCR ) in material collected by air samplings 1 - 1 , 1 - 3 , 2 - 1 , and 2 - 3 , 189 which had been performed without a HEPA filter covering the inlet tube . In contrast , in the presence of a 190 HEPA filter , no SARS - CoV - 2 genomes were detected in air samplings 1 - 2 and 2 - 2 ( Table 1 ) . 191 Virus - induced CPE were observed in LLC - MK2 and Vero E6 cells inoculated with material extruded 192 from the NP specimen of patient 1 and from liquid collection media from air samples 1 - 1 , 1 - 3 , 2 - 1 , and 2 - 193 3 . Early CPE in both LLC - MK2 and Vero E6 cells consisted of the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles 194 that were apparent within 2 days post - inoculation ( dpi ) of the cells with material extruded from the NP 195 swab and 4 to 6 dpi with aliquots of the liquid collection media from the air samplers . At later times ( 4 196 days onwards after inoculation of cell cultures with material from the NP swab , and 6 – 11 dpi of the cells 197 with material collected by air samplers ) , rounding of the cells occurred in foci , followed by detachment of 198 the cells from the growing surface . Some of the rounded cells detached in clumps , and occasional small 199 syncytia with 3 - 5 nuclei were observed . Apoptotic and necrotic cells were also observed . A 200 representative collage showing the progressive development of CPE in Vero E6 cells inoculated with 201 material collected during air sampling 1 - 1 is shown in Figure 2 . Cytopathic effects were not observed and 202 virus was not detected or isolated from the culture medium of samples 1 - 2 and 2 - 2 , wherein HEPA filters 203 had been affixed to the inlet nozzles of the air samplers , and were not observed in mock - inoculated cells 204 which were maintained in parallel with the inoculated cell cultures . 205 9 SARS - CoV - 2 - specific rRT - PCR tests were performed and the results indicated that the LLC - MK2 and 206 Vero E6 cultures inoculated with collection media from air samplings 1 - 1 , 1 - 3 , 2 - 1 , and 2 - 3 contained 207 SARS - CoV - 2 ( data not shown ) . No other respiratory virus was identified in the samples using a BioFire 208 FilmArray Respiratory 2 Panel ( BioMérieux Inc . , Durham , North Carolina ) , following the manufacturer’s 209 instructions . 210 Whereas the concentration of SARS - CoV - 2 genome equivalents per liter of air were estimated ( Table 211 2 ) , determination of the specific infectivity ( ratio of SARS - CoV - 2 genome equivalents present for every 212 one able to infect a cell in culture ) required performance of a plaque assay or a standard 50 % endpoint 213 dilution assay ( TCID 50 assay ) . Plaque assays could not be performed due to a nationwide non - availability 214 of some critical media components ( due to COVID - 19 pandemic - related temporary lockdown of 215 production facilities ) , so TCID 50 assays were performed in Vero E6 cells to estimate the percentage of the 216 collected virus particles that were viable . Estimates ranged from 2 to 74 TCID 50 units / L of air ( Table 3 ) . 217 A nearly complete SARS - CoV - 2 genome sequence was obtained by next - generation sequencing ( NGS ) 218 of RNA purified from cell culture medium of Vero E6 cells 7 dpi with NP swab material from patient 1 . 219 The nearly complete genome sequence ( and the virus isolate ) were designated SARS - CoV - 2 / human / UF - 220 19 / 2020 , and this genome sequence has been deposited in GenBank ( accession no . MT668716 ) and in 221 GISAID ( accession no . EPI _ ISL _ 480349 ) . Because the amount of virus RNA was below the threshold 222 that could be easily sequenced by our NGS methods , Sanger sequencing was used to sequence SARS - 223 CoV - 2 RNA purified from the collection media of air samplers 1 - 1 , 1 - 3 , 2 - 1 , and 2 - 3 . One complete 224 SARS - CoV - 2 sequence was attained for RNA purified in the material collected by air sampling 1 - 1 , and 225 three nearly complete sequences for 1 - 3 , 2 - 1 , and 2 - 3 , respectively . After alignment , comparisons of the 226 three partial sequences with the complete sequence of SARS - CoV - 2 in air sampling 1 - 1 indicated that the 227 same consensus genome sequence were present in the virions that had been collected in all the air 228 samplings . Moreover , they were an exact match with the corresponding sequences of the virus isolated 229 from patient 1 . This complete genome sequence of the virus collected by the air samplers ( and the virus 230 therein ) were considered the same isolate and designated SARS - CoV - 2 / Environment / UF - 20 / 2020 , and 231 10 this genome sequence has been deposited in GenBank ( accession no . MT670008 ) and in GISAID 232 ( accession no . EPI _ ISL _ 477163 ) . The virus’ genomic sequence currently falls within GISAID clade 233 B . 1 ( GH ) , which is characterized by mutations C241T , C3037T , A23403G , G25563T , S - D614G , and 234 NS3 - Q57H relative to reference genome WIV04 ( GenBank accession no . MN996528 . 1 ) . As of 10 July 235 2020 , SARS - CoV - 2 clade B . 1 ( GH ) was the predominant virus lineage in circulation in the USA . 236 237 Discussion 238 There are substantial epidemiologic data supporting the concept that SARS - CoV , which is highly related 239 to SARS - CoV - 2 , 3 was transmitted via an aerosol route . 31 - 33 For SARS - CoV - 2 , there have also been two 240 epidemiologic reports consistent with aerosol transmission . 15 , 34 However , despite these reports , 241 uncertainties remain about the relative importance of aerosol transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , given that so 242 far , only one study has provided weak evidence of virus isolation from material collected by air 243 samplers . 21 In other reports , attempts to isolate the virus were not successful . The current study takes 244 advantage of a newer air sampling technology that operates using a water - vapor condensation mechanism , 245 facilitating the likelihood of isolating the virus in tissue culture . 246 As reported in air sampling tests performed by others 9 - 11 , 21 and in our previous report , 23 airborne 247 SARS - CoV - 2 was present in a location with COVID - 19 patients . The distance from the air - samplers to 248 the patients ( ≥ 2 m ) suggests that the virus was present in aerosols . Unlike previous studies , we have 249 demonstrated the virus in aerosols can be viable , and this suggests that there is an inhalation risk for 250 acquiring COVID - 19 within the vicinity of people who emit the virus through expirations including 251 coughs , sneezes , and speaking . 252 The amount of airborne virus detected per liter of air was small , and future studies should address ( a ) 253 whether this is typical for COVID - 19 , ( b ) if this represented virus production relative to the phase of 254 infection in the patient , ( c ) if this was a consequence of active air flow related to air exchanges within the 255 11 room , ( d ) or if the low number of virus was due to technical difficulties in removing small airborne 256 particles from the air . 26 257 Our findings reveal that viable SARS - CoV - 2 can be present in aerosols generated by a COVID - 19 258 patient in a hospital room in the absence of an aerosol - generating procedure , and can thus serve as a 259 source for transmission of the virus in this setting . Moreover , the public health implications are broad , 260 especially as current best practices for limiting the spread of COVID - 19 center on social distancing , 261 wearing of face - coverings while in proximity to others and hand - washing . For aerosol - based 262 transmission , measures such as physical distancing by 6 feet would not be helpful in an indoor setting , 263 provide a false - sense of security and lead to exposures and outbreaks . With the current surges of cases , to 264 help stem the COVID - 19 pandemic , clear guidance on control measures against SARS - CoV - 2 aerosols 265 are needed , as recently voiced by other scientists . 35 266 267 268 Contributors 269 JAL , ML , ZHF , AJ , AEF , KC , JGM Jr , and C - YW conceived and designed the study .
