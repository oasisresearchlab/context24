Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitoring during daily activities ( walking or exercising ) is desir - able from the clinical point of view to detect anomalies . Optically unobtrusive electrodes facilitate the ubiquitous acquisition of health data . A zeolite - based dry electrode was investigated as a long - term sensor with high transparency . Electrodes fabricated with two different zeolites ( 4 ˚A and 13X ) , different thicknesses , and surfaces were analyzed to evaluate electrical characteristics and the Signal - to - Noise ( SNR ) on ECG acquisitions . Zeolite 4 ˚A evidenced a higher SNR , up to 37 . 5 dB , compared to Zeolite 13X electrodes with an SNR of 35 . 2 dB , having a concentration of 4 w / w % . Increasing the diameter from 20 to 30 mm results in an enhancement of 7 . 8 % of SNR . A 12 % improvement in SNR is reported when the thickness of the electrode is decreased by 50 % , showing that a decrease in thickness of the electrode contributes to the advancement of SNR .

I NTRODUCTION Cardiovascular diseases are significant causes of death in the United States and many industrial nations , second only to all cancers combined in terms of the number of lives lost annually [ 1 ] . Most cardiac failures are triggered by cardiac electrical abnormalities . American Heart Association ( AHA ) reported that there had been over 350 , 000 emergency medical services - assessed out - of - hospital sudden cardiac arrests and related pathologies occurring annually [ 2 ] . Most heart failure events are sporadic and cannot be monitored and identified in short clinical follow - up . A basic continuous , long - term heart monitoring outside a clinical setting ( either at home or in a public setting or nursing home ) would collect at least electrocardiogram ( ECG ) data to identify discrepancies [ 3 ] . Bio - electrodes are the key components of wearable ECG monitoring systems [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] . Widely used Ag / AgCl wet elec - trodes are not suitable for long - term monitoring since they inherently suffer from dehydration , and thus their reliability is only ensured for short - term clinical sessions and recording . Dry electrodes were recently highlighted as novel technologies to address long - term ECG monitoring . ECG acquisition , while moving , can be critical . Although there are many devices and applications in the market , acquiring a reliable ECG signal is always a matter of continuous development [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] . Most of the recent dry electrodes are fabricated with polymeric composites to improve perspiration with the body on long - term contact regarding unshielded metal - based electrodes ( which are more prone to noise ) . Polymer - based dry electrodes are also more conformable [ 8 ] . Such composites can be prepared using different dispersed fillers ( e . g . , carbon black , carbon nanotubes , metal particles ) , etc . , which result in opaque sen - sors [ 9 ] . This work’s innovative part identifies dry electrodes’ proper dimension and transparency . Optically unobtrusive dry electrodes are fabricated using a biocompatible substrate made of polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) with zeolite particles . Zeolite is a widely known family of nanoporous materials with fascinating ion exchange properties , and , recently , it was investigated as an anti - reflective layer in the UV – Vis – NIR range [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] . A recent study involving two different types of fillers ( zeolite 13X and 4 * ) was conducted at a concentration of 4 and 12 w / w / % and showed Zeolites are suitable for long - term ECG acquisition and safe on skin [ 12 ] . Two circular size electrodes of 30 mm diameter and 20 mm diameter are fabricated for each type of zeolite material . This research aims to build a compact , wearable , and optically transparent ECG acquisition system that can acquire reliable ECG data at a high Signal - to - Noise ratio ( SNR ) . High signal fidelity makes it possible to have accurate analysis and diagnosis . A comparison between the effect of the thickness and surface variations on the impedance , conductivity , and SNR is investigated . This paper is organized as follows : Section II describes the fabrication , effect of thickness variation on SNR , and signal processing through feature extraction , Section III presents the ECG signals acquired using two different sets of zeolite electrodes , SNR values , and their respective ECG features , and the concluding remarks are presented in Section IV . II . D ESIGN AND E XPERIMENTAL SETUP A . Zeolite - based Dry Electrode Traditionally available Ag / AgCl wet electrodes have skin irritations along with the higher possibilities of motion artifacts and have led to the development of alternative technologies such as dry electrodes , allowing better stability over days or weeks without signal degradation , and patient discomfort [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . For long - term performance monitoring , a soft conductive polymer , such as PDMS - based flexible dry electrodes , is preferred [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] . In our prior work , a novel optically unobtrusive dry electrode with zeolite - based composite is proposed for long - term and reliable ( with an SNR of 42 . 5 2022 I EEE S e n s o r s | 9 78 - 1 - 6654 - 8464 - 0 / 22 / $ 31 . 00 © 2022 I E EE | D O I : 10 . 1109 / S E N S O R S 52175 . 2022 . 9967325 Fig . 1 .

Two distinct types , 4 ˚A and 13X zeolites , have been investigated . The electrodes are fabricated by evaporating a thin metal layer ( silver in the actual arrangement ) onto a substrate of polymethylmethacrylate ( PMMA ) and then by depositing a mixture of PDMS and zeolite particles on it by spinning . Composite thickness is determined by the speed and duration of the process . Type 4 ˚A zeolite is characterized by cubical particles with openings of 4 ˚A ( sodium as a mobile cation ) , while zeolite 13X has a different crystalline structure with openings of about 10 ˚A and sodium as a mobile cation . Zeolite , which possesses morpho - structural , chemical - physical , and mechanical properties , is widely used for various applications ( e . g . , molecular sieve , absorber material , etc . ) . More recently , zeolite - modified electrodes were proposed for the fabrication of variegate sensors [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] . Fig . 1 ( a ) presents the major components of the electrode and the optical characteristics of the PMMA substrate and the PDMS / zeolite composite ( Fig . 1 ( b ) ) . Table I shows the geometrical characteristics of the dry electrodes used for the subsequent characterization . Since the composite is mostly an insulator , the thickness influences the charge accumulation and , thus , the capaci - tance between the electrodes , while filler concentration is expected to influence the inherent current loss in the dielectric . Impedance measurements were performed to analyze the effect of geometry and filler on the performance of the electrode . A representative zeolite electrode is shown in Fig . 2 . The electric field generated is given by Eq . ( 1 ) , where Q is the charge , ϵ is the permittivity of the composite , S the surface area , and d the thickness of the electrode . E = Q ϵ × S ( 1 ) The SNR was evaluated by Eq . ( 2 ) , where P signal is the power of the ECG signal , and P noise is that of the background noise . Prior research work on the effect of thickness variation Fig . 2 . Fabricated dry electrode in which can be seen the transparent substrate ( PMMA ) , the transparent composite layer ( PDMS / Zeolite ) , and the Ag electrode . Fig . 3 . Using Zeolites - based electrodes for ECG acquisition at rest on dry electrodes concluded that electrode thickness hardly affected the ECG signal evaluation [ 5 ] . The conductivity of the electrode is measured based on the formulae discussed in our prior work [ 10 ] . Impedance was evaluated by an RLC meter ( Keysight E4980A , USA ) in the range 1 Hz – 10 kHz . ECGs are captured from the subject while at rest and walking . NI’s myDAQ card is used for ECG measurement ( sampling frequency of 2 , 500 Hz ) . The setup is shown in Fig . 3 . The denoising and baseline wandering are effectively handled using discrete wavelet transform , and the SNR of the ECG signal is measured using MATLAB code . The clean ECG signal is processed and features such as heart rate , RR interval , QRS interval , PR interval , and QT interval are extracted from the ECG signal . MATLAB tool is used for preliminary analysis . MATLAB allows importing ECG signals from various data sources , preprocessing of the signals and extracting relevant features , and exporting ECG features for heart rate variability analysis . SNR = 10 × log ( P signal P noise ) ( 2 ) III . R ESULTS As a function of frequency , for low frequencies , 4 ˚A dry electrodes indicate higher - order resistance ( 1 . 4 G Ω ) and ca - pacitance values in comparison to 13X electrodes ( ≤ 1 G Ω ) , as shown in Fig . 4 ( a ) , and Fig . 4 ( b ) . As evidence shows , there is variability for the same electrodes . However , this is mainly because of the negligible differences in thickness between the same type of electrodes . The capacitance is constant in the considered band . The conductivity , instead , is reported in Fig . 5 ( a ) for 4 ˚A electrodes and Fig . 5 ( b ) for 13X electrodes . After the ECG is obtained using 4 ˚A and 13X electrodes , the SNR is determined using a MATLAB code . The SNR of the ECG signal is recorded using sensors of the same diameter , but Fig . 4 . Resistance and Capacitance plot of ( a ) 4A ( b ) 13X electrodes Fig . 5 . Conductivity plots ( a ) 4A ( b ) 13X electrodes varying thickness values are tabulated and recorded in Table II . The SNR showed an improvement of 81 . 2 % with a decrease in the thickness of 50 µ m in 30 mm diameter 4 ˚A electrodes . The SNR is improved in 20 mm diameter electrodes by 12 . 2 % for a decrease in thickness by 61 . 1 µ m . The SNR for 4 ˚A electrodes is improved better than 13X electrodes with the geometric variations . The ECG signals of the electrodes 13X 20 mm with a thickness of 93 . 3 µ m ( 13X - 3 ) and 13X 20 mm with a thickness of 46 . 6 µ m ( 13X - 4 ) are shown in Fig . 6 ( a ) and Fig . 6 ( b ) . Placing type 4 ˚A Zeolite - based dry electrodes of 30 mm diameter and thickness of 66 . 2 µ m on the wrists of a healthy subject while at rest and while walking , ECG is captured . The plots are shown in Fig . 7 ( a ) and Fig . 7 ( b ) , respectively . The features of interest , such as the heart rate , RR interval , QRS interval , PR interval , and QT interval , are evaluated . The values of the features are tabulated in Table III . By comparing the features with the typical values of a healthy subject , the extracted features are comparable without significant variations [ 19 ] . Prior research work on the effect of thickness variation on dry electrodes evidence that electrode thickness hardly affected the ECG signal measurement [ 5 ] . Zeolite - based electrodes , apart from their optical transparency , which can be of help for minimally invasive applications , evidenced an SNR increase with thickness and are proven safe on the skin for long - term monitoring in comparison with commercial electrodes [ 20 ] . For a concentration of 4 w / w % , 4 ˚A 30 mm diameter electrodes , the decrease in thickness from 116 . 7 µ m to 66 . 2 µ m suggested an 81 % increase in SNR . IV . C ONCLUSION In this work , we examine how geometry affects the perfor - mance of optically unobtrusive zeolite electrodes . The charac - terization of dry electrodes composed of PDMS and zeolite 4 ˚A Fig . 6 . ECG signal acquired using ( a ) 13X - 3 ( 93 . 3 µ m ) and ( b ) 13X - 4 ( 46 . 6 µ m ) Fig . 7 . ECG acquired using 4 - 2 ( 66 . 2 µ m ) dry electrodes while ( a ) at rest ( b ) walking and 13X , their optical and electrical characteristics , and their SNR during ECG acquisition are studied . The ECG signal measurements suggest 4 ˚A 4 w / w % with 20 mm diameter has the highest SNR of 37 . 5 dB . In experiments , reduced thickness of Type 4 ˚A 4 w / w % 30 mm diameter zeolite electrodes acquired better ECG signals , an improvement of 81 % in SNR , with thickness reduction of 43 % and hence best suited for reliable , accurate ECG signal acquisition . The SNR does evidence significant improvement by increasing the surface area . The impedance and conductivity play a prominent role in the SNR improvement . On the 20 mm diameter 13X electrodes , a decrease in thickness yields a 5 % increase in SNR , and the electrode have an SNR of 35 . 2 dB . TABLE II SNR FOR Z EOLITES BASED DRY ELECTRODES Sl .
