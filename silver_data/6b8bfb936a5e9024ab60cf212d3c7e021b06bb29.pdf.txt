Mast cell activators : a new class of highly effective vaccine adjuvants James B McLachlan 1 , 5 , Christopher P Shelburne 1 , 5 , Justin P Hart 1 , Salvatore V Pizzo 1 , Rajen Goyal 1 , Rhea Brooking - Dixon 1 , Herman F Staats 1 – 3 & Soman N Abraham 1 , 2 , 4 Mast cells ( MCs ) have recently received recognition as prominent effectors in the regulation of immune cell migration to draining lymph nodes and lymphocyte activation . However , their role in the development of humoral immune responses is not clear . Here , we demonstrate that subcutaneous or nasal administration of small - molecule MC activators with vaccine antigens evokes large increases in antigen - speciﬁc serum immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) responses . These responses were MC dependent and correlated with increased dendritic cell and lymphocyte recruitment to draining lymph nodes . Nasal instillation of these formulations also evoked antigen - speciﬁc secretory IgA and provided protection against anthrax lethal toxin challenge in vitro and against vaccinia virus infection in vivo . Collectively , these results deﬁne the MC as an integral sensory arm of the adaptive immune system . Moreover , they highlight MC activators as a new class of vaccine adjuvants , capable of inducing protective antigen - speciﬁc immune responses through needle - free routes of administration . Our understanding of MC function has been rapidly expanding in recent years . Although they had been principally thought of as a causative agent in allergy and asthma , MCs are now known to be essential for the resolution of bacterial infections through neutrophil mobilization to the site of infection 1 , 2 . MCs are also required for the enhanced recruitment of lymphocytes 3 and Langerhans cells 4 to draining lymph nodes ( DLNs ) , a process required for the induction of adaptive immune responses 5 . Indeed , antigen - bearing dendritic cell ( DC ) migration from peripheral tissues into the DLNs is essential for the priming of cognate T cells and their subsequent ability to provide help for the production of antigen - speciﬁc antibodies by plasma B cells 6 , 7 . Thus , MCs seem to coordinately initiate both the innate immune response and immune cell migration believed to be essential in stimulating the adaptive immune response . These functions are believed to be due to the capacity of MCs to rapidly release pre - stored inﬂammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) and histamine within minutes of activation 8 . In the present study , we sought to examine the role of the MC in the induction of antigen - speciﬁc humoral immune responses . We hypothesized that the admin - istration of small - molecule MC activating compounds in conjunction with protein antigens would result in a potent and protective antigen - speciﬁc immune response . RESULTSMCactivators mobilize immune effectors to DLNs MC - activating compounds comprise a structurally diverse , cationic group of peptides and polymeric compounds known to trigger G i protein – dependent exocytic release of MC granule components both in vitro and in vivo 9 , 10 . To characterize the ability of these compounds to initiate an immune response , we ﬁrst examined the ability of several well known MC activators , including compound 48 / 80 ( c48 / 80 ) 11 , MC degranulating peptide ( MCD ) 9 and catestatin ( CgA 344 – 364 ) 12 to mobilize elevated numbers of DCs and lymphocytes to DLNs . Sub - cutaneous footpad injection of c48 / 80 induced increases in both DC numbers and total cellularity in footpad DLNs that reached peak intensity by 24 h compared to vehicle - injected controls ( Fig . 1 ) . DC numbers and total cellularity then decreased by 48 h ( data not shown ) . In order to determine the dependence of this response on MCs , we undertook this study in wild - type ( WT ) mice ; MC - deﬁcient ( Kit W / Kit W - v ) mice , hereinafter referred to as W / W v ; and W / W v mice with MC - reconstituted footpads . Although initial footpad tissue – resident DC numbers were identical in all strains ( data not shown ) , W / W v mice demonstrated signiﬁcantly lower cellularity and DC numbers in DLNs 24 h after c48 / 80 challenge compared to MC - sufﬁcient mice ( Fig . 1a , d , g ) . Similar MC - dependent increases in DCs and total cellularity were also observed with both MCD ( Fig . 1b , e , g ) and catestatin ( Fig . 1c , f , g ) , in the same time course as induced by c48 / 80 . Reduced DC trafﬁcking to DLNs in W / W v mice could be explained , in part , by the reduced expression of the lymph node homing chemokine receptor CCR7 on W / W v footpad DCs compared to WT controls , 8 h after c48 / 80 challenge ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , b online ) . This suggested a requirement for MCs in the optimal expression of CCR7 on DCs . In support of this , we found that prolonged incubation of bone marrow – derived DCs with c48 / 80 did not induce the expression of this migratory marker Received 13 February ; accepted 26 March ; published online 20 April 2008 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / nm1757 Departments of 1 Pathology , 2 Immunology , 3 Medicine and 4 Molecular Genetics & Microbiology , Duke University Medical Center , Durham , North Carolina 27710 , USA . 5 These authors contributed equally to this work .

Collectively , these data suggest that MC - activating compounds such as c48 / 80 induce enhanced DC and lymphocyte trafﬁcking to DLNs by activating MCs . c48 / 80 induces MC - dependent humoral immunity The ability of MC - activating compounds to coordinately regulate optimal increases in DC and lymphocyte sequestration in DLNs , events required for the initiation of adaptive immune responses 5 , suggested that protective antigen - speciﬁc immune responses could be generated through the administration of a MC activator together with a protein antigen . To test this notion , we immunized the footpads of WT mice with one injection of 0 . 5 m g of PA ( protective antigen from Bacillus anthracis ) and 32 m g of c48 / 80 , the most potent of the MC activators tested . To demonstrate the direct contribution of MCs , we also immunized W / W v mice , as well as W / W v mice reconstituted with MCs in the footpad . Sera from each group of mice was collected on days 7 and 14 and assayed for PA - speciﬁc total IgG . PA alone elicited minimal responses in WT , W / W v or MC - reconstituted W / W v mice by day 7 ( data not shown ) . However , PA administered with c48 / 80 induced signiﬁcant PA - speciﬁc IgG titers in WT mice by day 7 , which increased by day 14 ( Fig . 2a ) . PA administered with c48 / 80 in W / W v mice was able to induce an immune response , suggesting that c48 / 80 can act on non - MCs . However , this response was signiﬁcantly deﬁcient at day 7 and day 14 compared to WT controls ( Fig . 2a ) . Notably , this deﬁciency was repaired by the reconstitution of MCs at the site of injection ( Fig . 2a ) . Finally , to conﬁrm that c48 / 80 was acting through DCs , as suggested by the data in Figure 1a – c , we made use of the CD11c – diphtheria toxin receptor ( DTR ) mouse that has a simian DTR under control of the murine CD11c promoter 13 . When these mice are injected with diphtheria toxin , their DCs are effectively ablated . We injected c48 / 80 plus PA into DC - ablated CD11c - DTR mice and unablated controls . As expected , DC - ablated CD11c - DTR mice were unable to mount an efﬁcient PA - speciﬁc response compared to controls ( Fig . 2b ) . The partial recovery of humoral responses on day 14 in CD11c - DTR mice is consistent with the fact that ablation of DCs only lasts 24 – 48 h ( ref . 13 ) . Therefore , these data collectively suggest that MC activators act as efﬁcient adjuvants and that their mode of action is mediated through MC - dependent enhancement of DC and lymphocyte migration to DLNs . A major pre - stored component of the MC granule demonstrated to inﬂuence both lymphocyte and DC mobilization to DLNs is TNF 3 , 14 . Therefore , MC - derived TNF might be a critical component of the primary humoral response elicited by MC - activating com - pounds . To examine this , we repeated the previous study in the footpads of W / W v mice reconstituted with WT or Tnf (cid:1) / (cid:1) MCs with 0 . 5 m g of PA and 32 m g of c48 / 80 . Once again , sera from each group of mice was collected after 7 and 14 d and assayed for PA speciﬁc total IgG . As expected , PA - speciﬁc responses were reduced in W / W v mice reconstituted with Tnf (cid:1) / (cid:1) MCs compared to the responses observed in W / W v mice reconstituted with WT MCs after 7 d ( Fig . 2c ) , indicating that MC TNF is a principal product in the development of optimal antigen - speciﬁc immune responses during MC activator challenge . c48 / 80 activates MCs in the NALT Although the previous results demonstrate that MC activation induces a humoral response after a subcutaneous injection , the primary route of pathogen entry is along mucosal surfaces , such as the gastrointest - inal , urinary and respiratory tracts 15 . In light of this , we chose to induce an immune response by way of the nasal mucosa of mice through the activation of MCs with c48 / 80 . Immunization at this site has been shown to effectively evoke antigen - speciﬁc serum - IgG as well as secretory - IgA ( refs . 16 – 18 ) responses , presumably due to activation of the nasal associated lymphoid tissue ( NALT ) 19 . Initially , we char - acterized the MC populations in this region . Cross - sections through the nose revealed large numbers of MCs in close proximity to the NALT ( Fig . 3a ) .

This is noteworthy because CTMC are markedly more responsive to c48 / 80 than MMC 21 , 22 . Delivery of 32 m g of c48 / 80 into the nose induced a marked decrease in the numbers of MCs in or around the palate ( Fig . 3b ) , probably owing to MC degranulation 3 . As was observed in the skin , administration of c48 / 80 induced DCs to migrate into the T - cell areas of the nasal associated lymphoid tissue ( NALT ) ( Fig . 3c ) . In addition , instillation of c48 / 80 plus antigen into the nose was also found to induce antigen - speciﬁc CD4 + T - cell activation as determined by antigen restimulation assays ( Supplementary Fig . 2a online ) , but only modestly affected CD8 + T - cell responses ( Supplementary Fig . 2b , c ) . Lastly , 14 d after nasal introduction of c48 / 80 in conjunc - tion with PA , PA - speciﬁc serum IgG was increased in WTmice but not W / W v mice ( Fig . 3d ) . No serologic response was seen in either strain after administration of PA alone ( data not shown ) . Various attempts to replenish the nasal regions of W / W v mice with cultured MCs were unsuccessful ; therefore , data involving reconstituted W / W v mice are not available . Collectively , these data indicate that c48 / 80 mediates T - dependent immune responses after nasal administration , and , as in the footpad model , MCs are required for the induction of humoral immune responses . Therefore , regardless of the route , MC activators act as powerful adjuvants capable of initiating speciﬁc immune response to pathogen products . c48 / 80 is a potent mucosal adjuvant To further characterize the adjuvant properties of MC activators , we compared the efﬁcacy of various doses of c48 / 80 to cholera toxin , currently considered the gold standard mucosal adjuvant 18 , 23 . Mice were challenged nasally with PA alone or with increasing concentra - tions of c48 / 80 on days 0 , 7 and 14 , and then bled on day 21 or 22 unless otherwise indicated . All doses of c48 / 80 tested resulted in higher titers of antigen - speciﬁc IgG as compared to PA alone ( Fig . 4a ) . Additionally , antibody titers from mice immunized with the doses of c48 / 80 from 125 m g to 8 m g were comparable to or greater than titers from mice immunized with cholera toxin . No signiﬁcant difference in isotype titers was observed between c48 / 80 and cholera toxin treatments ( data not shown ) . Heightened PA - speciﬁc serum IgG titers were also observed with catestatin ( Supplementary Fig . 3 online ) . Notably , increased PA - speciﬁc serum IgG titers in mice nasally immunized with c48 / 80 plus PA were maintained for at least 6 months ( Fig . 4b ) , and these responses were dependent on neither antigen ( including diphtheria toxin or FimH antigen from uropathogenic Escherichia coli ) nor mouse strain ( Supplementary Fig . 4a , b online ) . As previously noted , mucosal immunization can induce the pro - duction of secretory IgA at mucosal sites . Therefore we investigated whether c48 / 80 had this effect . Mucosal secretions from sites proximal to the site of vaccine administration ( saliva ) , as well as more distal sites ( vaginal washings and fecal extracts ) were collected from immunized mice on day 21 and assayed .

The relatively low IgA antibody titers seen in mucosal secretions compared to IgG serum titers are typical and attributable to the dilution effect of mucosal ﬂuids 24 . Thus , after nasal administration , c48 / 80 was an effective inducer of IgA responses at various mucosal sites . Collectively , these data suggest that adminis - tration of a MC activator along with peptide or subunit antigens can induce humoral responses that are at least as vigorous and long - lasting as those induced by cholera toxin , the most effective mucosal adjuvant described to date . It should be noted that these responses were not due to the effect of contaminating Toll - like receptor ( TLR ) ligands , as preparations of MC - activating compounds did not activate reporter cell lines overexpressing speciﬁc TLRs ( Supplementary Fig . 5a online ) . Furthermore , MC activators were able to elicit humoral responses in TLR4 mutant C3H / HeJ mice that were comparable to those in WT C3H / HeN mice ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . We also found that c48 / 80 elicited similar responses in Myd88 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and WT C57BL / 6 controls ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . Thus , MC activators can act as potent adjuvants for the induction of both systemic and mucosal immunity by mechanisms independent of TLRs . c48 / 80 induces protective humoral immunity We also assayed the antigen - speciﬁc antibody titers observed after immunization with MC activators for their protective function using an in vitro neutralizing assay featuring the lethal effects of anthrax lethal toxin ( LeTx ) , of which PA is a subunit 25 , 26 . We found that adding to LeTx the serum of mice immunized with c48 / 80 plus PAwas highly effective in protecting a macrophage cell line from LeTx - induced killing in vitro ( Fig . 5a ) . Furthermore , we used a vaccinia virus challenge model to demonstrate effective in vivo protection after immunization with c48 / 80 plus the B5R poxvirus protein 27 . Mice immunized with c48 / 80 plus B5R had an elevated B5R - speciﬁc IgG antibody response ( 1 : 1 , 589 , 344 geometric mean titer ( GMT ) ) , whereas B5R alone immunized mice elicited no response . On day 98 , all mice were challenged nasally with 1 (cid:2) 10 5 plaque - forming units ( PFU ) of vaccinia virus WR . After 6 d , 100 % of mice immunized with B5R alone showed endpoint 15 % body weight loss and were put to death ( Fig . 5b ) . However , 50 % of mice nasally immunized with B5R plus c48 / 80 were protected against infection with vaccinia virus ( Fig . 5c ) . Therefore , MC activation by means of c48 / 80 confers high serum titers of functionally protective antigen - speciﬁc IgG antibody . c48 / 80 is a nontoxic nasal adjuvant Although the preceding results indicated that antigen delivery in the context of MC activation could protect mice against lethal pathogen challenge , it raised the specter of toxicity , either directly or through the binding of IgE antigen to Fc e RI receptors on the surface of MCs , leading to anaphylaxis . Although c48 / 80 induced mild transient nasal irritation at the highest dose tested , mice did not seem to suffer any other local or systemic side effects characterized by sustained inﬂam - mation of the nasal tissue or distal tissues , nor did the mice show any irregular respiration or changes in heart rates at the doses used in this study ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , we did not observe any staining in the upper airways or in the lung after applying c48 / 80 with a tracer dye into the nasal passages , indicating that c48 / 80 did not enter the upper airways or the lung ( data not shown ) . We also found that c48 / 80 did not affect either total or antigen - speciﬁc IgE levels , even at the highest dose ( Supplementary Fig . 6 online ) . Finally , we attempted to trigger anaphylaxis as previously described 28 by instilling 50 m g of PA into the peritoneal cavities of mice nasally immunized with c48 / 80 and PA and found no anaphylaxis nor any signs of distress ( data not shown ) . These data are consistent with human studies that observed that cutaneous application of c48 / 80 did not induce any serious long - term side effects 29 , 30 and demonstrate that MC activation in our studies as well seemed to have no notable adverse effects . DISCUSSION The present study demonstrated a heretofore unknown role of the MC in inducing a protective , antigen - speciﬁc humoral immune response . Notably , we found that the injection of small - molecule MC activators was sufﬁcient to induce potent and long - lasting humoral responses against protein subunit antigens . It is noteworthy that all MC activating compounds that we examined could induce strong humoral responses when applied nasally ( data not shown ) . MC activators were not able to elicit optimal antibody responses to antigen in W / W v mice , compared to those observed in WT controls . Optimal antibody responses could be restored in these mice by reconstituting the injection site with WT MCs but not Tnf (cid:1) / (cid:1) MCs , indicating the importance of MCs and of MC - derived TNF in mediating the adjuvant activity of MC - activating compounds . MCs seem to mediate the adjuvant activity of MC activators by inducing the enhanced mobilization of DCs to DLNs , in part by inducing the expression of the lymph node chemokine homing receptor CCR7 on tissue resident DCs . The expression of this molecule on DCs is absolutely required for their mobilization from the periph - eral tissues to the DLN 5 , 31 . It is likely that MCs accomplish this through the release of proinﬂammatory mediators , such as TNF , CD40 ligand , or prostaglandin E - 2 , all known to be produced by MCs and also shown to induce or enhance the expression of CCR7 on cultured DCs 32 , 33 . The importance of MCs in the adjuvant activity of MC activators is also underscored by the observation that none of the Figure 5 c48 / 80 - induced humoral responses confer protection against lethal challenge .

For instance , we found that c48 / 80 induced comparable humoral responses in Myd88 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and WT controls , and MC - activating compounds did not activate TLRs in vitro . Notably , these data also suggest that MC - dependent adjuvant activity operates independently of conventional signaling pathways such as those mediated through TLRs . In light of the fact that MCs reside at nearly all host - environment interfaces 34 , our ﬁndings demonstrate that MCs function as an integral , sensory arm of the immune system , capable of activating both the innate and adaptive immune systems to clear active infection and to provide lasting protection against subsequent challenges . These results are important at a time when bioterrorism and emerging infectious agents have sparked a renewed interest in the identiﬁcation of appro - priate vaccine candidates that can provide effective humoral protec - tion , especially along mucosal barriers likely to be the entry point for many pathogens 15 . A chief impediment to these efforts is the lack of effective adjuvants ; those in existence have limited effectiveness and are known to have long - term associated toxic effects 35 . Although most adjuvants have been developed on a random basis with little informa - tion on their mechanisms of action , our ﬁndings illuminate the MC as a possible target for vaccine adjuvants , including , but not limited to , the small - molecule MC secretagogues used here . It is noteworthy that because of the abundance of MCs within nasal mucosal surfaces , MC activators can be used through nasal instillation , providing a suitable needle - free alternative for future vaccine development .

MC - deﬁcient mice were reconstituted with MCs as previously described 3 ( Supplementary Methods online ) . TNF - deﬁcient mice on a C57BL / 6 back - ground were purchased from B & K Universal . Mice were housed in the Duke University vivarium and provided food and water ad libitum . All experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Duke Division of Laboratory Animal Resources and the Duke University institutional animal care and use committee . Immunizations . Mice were nasally immunized according to previously estab - lished protocols with slight modiﬁcations 36 . Brieﬂy , mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane . Antigen or antigen plus adjuvant was administered in a total volume of 15 m l of ultrapure 0 . 9 % saline at 7 . 5 m l per nostril . PA , diphtheria toxin and cholera toxin were obtained from List Biological Labs . c48 / 80 was prepared as a stock solution in saline . All ﬁnal dilutions were made in saline . For footpad immunizations , 0 . 5 m g recombinant PA , with or without 32 m g c48 / 80 in saline , was injected in the footpad . For DC - recruitment and DLN - hypertrophy studies , footpads were injected with 32 m g c48 / 80 , 1 m M catestatin or 10 m M MCD in a 20 m l volume . Confocal microscopy . Tissue section preparation is described in Supplemen - tary Methods . Confocal images of tissue sections were obtained with a Nikon Confocal Laser Scanning Instrument containing an argon 488 - nm laser , a He - Ne 543 - nm laser and a He - NE 633 - nm laser . Images were obtained using a Plan Fluor (cid:2) 20 oil objective and EZ - C1 Nikon software with a channel - series approach to prevent spectral overlap between ﬂuorescent signals . Threshold values for background ﬂuorescence were determined using appropriate isotype - matched control – stained sections . Flow cytometry . DLN , NALT and footpad single - cell preparations were prepared as described in Supplementary Methods . To detect CCR7 , samples were initially labeled with anti - CCR7 ( Clone EBI - 1 ) ( eBioSciences ) , at 37 1 C for 30 min . Samples were then cooled to 4 1 C and labeled with a polyclonal , phycoerythrin - labeled Fab 2 antibody to rat IgG ( anti – rat IgG ; eBioSciences ) . To detect DCs , samples lastly were labeled with phycoerythrin - Cy5 - labeled anti – MHC class II ( clone M5 / 114 . 15 . 2 , eBioSciences ) and with allophyco - cyanin - or FITC - labeled anti - CD11c ( clone HL3 , BD BioSciences ) . Sectioning and staining of mouse snouts . Mouse snouts were prepared as described in Supplementary Methods . We cut 10 - m m frozen cross sections of the snout on a Leica CM1850 cryotome , air - dried them on slides , and stained them with either 0 . 5 % toluidine blue in 0 . 5 M HCl in PBS or with 0 . 5 % alcian blue in 0 . 3 % acetic acid . Alcian blue – stained slides were rinsed with tap water and stained with 0 . 1 % saffranin O in 0 . 1 % acetic acid . All stains were purchased from Sigma . Slides were then air - dried and cover - slipped with Permount ( Fisher Scientiﬁc ) for microscopic examination . Serial sections were made for each treatment group and MCs were enumerated in 8 – 12 randomly selected sections . IgG ELISA . We collected samples as described in the Supplementary Methods . Antigen with which mice had been immunized was coated onto 384 - well plates at 1 – 2 m g / ml . After blocking , plates were washed and samples were then diluted two - fold and added to the plates to be incubated overnight at 4 1 C . Plates were washed and a secondary antibody ( speciﬁc for total IgG , IgA , or IgG isotypes ) coupled to alkaline phosphatase was added to each well and the plate was incubated for 2 h at 25 1 C . Attophos substrate ( Promega ) was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature ; the plate was then read on a ﬂuorescence microplate reader at 440 nm excitation and 570 nm emission . The end - point titer presented in the results is representative of the reciprocal log 2 dilution of the last sample for which the optical density was at least three - fold higher than that of the naive sample . The geometric mean titer and s . d . were calculated using the log 2 end - point titers that are then presented as the antilog in ﬁgures and tables . Statistics were performed on the log 2 titers before conversion . Assessment of IgE titers is described in the Supplementary Methods . Protection assays . The macrophage protection assay is described in the Supplementary Methods . For the vaccinia challenge , isoﬂurane - anesthetized mice were challenged by the nasal route with 1 (cid:2) 10 5 PFU vaccinia virus WR ( Advanced Biotechnologies ) in 30 m l sterile PBS ( 15 m l per nostril ) . We monitored mice daily and recorded body weights . The end point for infection was a loss of 15 % of the original body weight on the day of infection . Mice were put to death humanely once they reached this end point . Mice that did not lose 15 % of body weight survived the vaccinia challenge . Mice were monitored daily for 14 d . Statistical analysis . Results were analyzed for statistical signiﬁcance using the unpaired Student’s t - test in Microsoft Excel . Differences between groups were considered signiﬁcant if P r 0 . 05 . A Fisher’s exact test was used to determine whether immunization with B5R plus c48 / 80 provided signiﬁcantly greater protection against death than immunization with B5R alone .
