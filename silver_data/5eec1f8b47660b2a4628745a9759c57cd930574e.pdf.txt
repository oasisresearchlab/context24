OPEN ORIGINAL ARTICLE Wnt5a induces ROR1 to complex with HS1 to enhance migration of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells MK Hasan 1 , J Yu 1 , L Chen 1 , Bing Cui 1 , GF Widhopf II 1 , L Rassenti 1 , Z Shen 2 , SP Briggs 2 and TJ Kipps 1 ROR1 ( receptor tyrosine kinase - like orphan receptor 1 ) is a conserved , oncoembryonic surface antigen expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . We found that ROR1 associates with hematopoietic - lineage - cell - speci ﬁ c protein 1 ( HS1 ) in freshly isolated CLL cells or in CLL cells cultured with exogenous Wnt5a . Wnt5a also induced HS1 tyrosine phosphorylation , recruitment of ARHGEF1 , activation of RhoA and enhanced chemokine - directed migration ; such effects could be inhibited by cirmtuzumab , a humanized anti - ROR1 mAb . We generated truncated forms of ROR1 and found its extracellular cysteine - rich domain or kringle domain was necessary for Wnt5a - induced HS1 phosphorylation . Moreover , the cytoplamic , and more speci ﬁ cally the proline - rich domain ( PRD ) , of ROR1 was required for it to associate with HS1 and allow for F - actin polymerization in response to Wnt5a . Accordingly , we introduced single amino acid substitutions of proline ( P ) to alanine ( A ) in the ROR1 PRD at positions 784 , 808 , 826 , 841 or 850 in potential SH3 - binding motifs . In contrast to wild - type ROR1 , or other ROR1 P → A mutants , ROR1 P ( 841 ) A had impaired capacity to recruit HS1 and ARHGEF1 to ROR1 in response to Wnt5a . Moreover , Wnt5a could not induce cells expressing ROR1 P ( 841 ) A to phosphorylate HS1 or activate ARHGEF1 , and was unable to enhance CLL - cell motility . Collectively , these studies indicate HS1 plays an important role in ROR1 - dependent Wnt5a - enhanced chemokine - directed leukemia - cell migration . Leukemia ( 2017 ) 31 , 2615 – 2622 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / leu . 2017 . 133 INTRODUCTION ROR1 ( receptor tyrosine kinase - like orphan receptor 1 ) is an evolutionarily conserved , type - I membrane protein that is expressed during embryogenesis , where it plays a key role in skeletal and neural organogenesis . 1 – 4 Expression of ROR1 attenuates during fetal development and , with few exceptions , 5 is negligible on most normal postpartum tissues . 6 However , we and others have found the leukemia cells of most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) express ROR1 , 6 – 8 suggesting it may play a role in pathogenesis . Consistent with this notion are studies showing that expression of ROR1 can enhance disease progression in mouse models of this leukemia , 9 and in patients with CLL . 10 We found that ROR1 can serve as a receptor for Wnt5a , 6 which prior studies showed could induce non - canonical Wnt signaling involved in directional cell migration and planar - cell polarity . 11 More recent studies on CLL cells found Wnt5a could induce ROR1 to form hetero - oligomers with ROR2 and recruit and activate guanine exchange factors ( GEFs ) , resulting in activation of Rho GTPases and enhanced leukemia - cell migration and proliferation . 12 These effects of Wnt5a on CLL cells could be inhibited by cirmtuzumab , a humanized mAb speci ﬁ c for ROR1 that speci ﬁ cally could block the capacity of Wnt5a to enhance leukemia - cell proliferation or migration . However , the cytoplasmic proteins enabling Wnt5a to enhance ROR1 - dependent leukemia - cell migration were unknown . Important for the organization of the cytoskeleton required for migration and possibly planar - cell polarity is hematopoietic - lineage - cell - speci ﬁ c protein 1 ( HS1 ) . HS1 is a cytoplasmic protein that can be undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and promote polymerization and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton required for cell migration . 13 – 17 HS1 also contains an SH3 domain , which allows it to bind characteristic motifs ( - P - X - X - P - ) , which often are found in the proline - rich domains ( PRDs ) of other proteins . 18 – 20 HS1 also is expressed in CLL cells . 21 – 24 Moreover , expression and phosphorylation of HS1 correlates with enhanced CLL - cell migration and unfavorable prognosis for patients with CLL . 22 , 23 , 25 – 27 Here we report the ﬁ nding that Wnt5a induces ROR1 to associate with HS1 , which undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and recruits / activates ARHGEF1 to promote F - actin polymerization and leukemia - cell migration . MATERIALS AND METHODS Immunoprecipitation analysis Immunoprecipitation analysis was performed as described . 9 Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 10 m M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 50 m M NaCl and 1 m M EDTA with protease inhibitors ( Roche , Applied Science , Mannheim , Germany ) . The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16 000 g for 15 min . Immune precipitates were isolated using protein A agarose beads , followed by immunoblot or mass spectrometry analysis . Antibodies for immune precipitation were as follows : the anti - ROR1 antibodies ( cirmtuzumab or 4A5 ) were generated in our laboratory ; the anti - HS1 or ARHGEF1 antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology ( Danvers , MA , USA ) . Immunoblot analysis Western blot analysis was performed as described . 9 Equal amounts of total protein from each sample were separated by SDS - PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene di ﬂ uoride membrane . Western blot analysis was performed using primary mAbs speci ﬁ c for ROR1 ( Cell Signaling ) , HS1 ( Cell Signaling ) , phospho HS1 ( Y378 ) ( OriGene , Rockville , MD , USA ) , ARHGEF1 ( Cell Signaling ) or β - actin ( Cell Signaling ) , which were detected using secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . 1 Moores Cancer Center , University of California San Diego , La Jolla , CA , USA and 2 Section of Cell and Developmental Biology , University of California San Diego , La Jolla , CA , USA .

The cells then were placed into the top chamber of a Transwell culture polycarbonate insert with 6 . 5 - mm diameter and 5 μ m pore size ( Corning , Inc . , Corning , NY , USA ) . Cells were incubated for 2 h in serum - free medium at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 , and the migration toward chemokine ( CXCL12 , 200 ng / ml or CCL21 , 200 ng / ml ) was analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry . The percentage of migrating cells was calculated as the number of migrated cells in response to chemokine divided by the total number of input cells .

Wnt5a induces ROR1 to complex with HS1 MK Hasan et al 2616 Leukemia ( 2017 ) 2615 – 2622 common B - cell CLL and who provided written informed consent , in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) of the UCSD ( IRB approval number 080918 ) . RESULTS Wnt5a induces ROR1 to associate with HS1 in primary CLL cells We performed mass spectrometry - based proteomic analysis on anti - ROR1 immune precipitates from CLL - cell lysates and detected HS1 in addition to ROR1 ( Supplementary Figure S1A ) . Immunoblot analysis of anti - ROR1 or anti - HS1 immune precipitates con ﬁ rmed that ROR1 associated with HS1 in freshly isolated primary CLL cells ( Figures 1a and b ) . However , when we examined anti - ROR1 immune precipitates from lysates of CLL cells cultured overnight in Wnt5a - de ﬁ cient media , we found that HS1 was no longer associated with ROR1 . On the other hand , anti - ROR1 immune precipitates made from lysates of serum - starved CLL cells that were treated for 30 min with or without exogenous Wnt5a showed that Wnt5a could induce ROR1 to associate with HS1 ( Figure 1c ) . Treatment of the CLL cells with another non - cross - blocking anti - ROR1 mAb , cirmtuzumab , inhibited the capacity of Wnt5a to induce ROR1 to associate with HS1 in freshly isolated CLL cells ( Figure 1d ) . These results were corroborated using ﬂ uorescence confocal microscopy , which demonstrated that Wnt5a induced co - localization of ROR1 with HS1 in CLL cells cultured with exogenous Wnt5a , and that such co - localization could be inhibited by treatment of the CLL cells with cirmtuzumab ( Figures 1e and f ) . Wnt5a induces HS1 phosphorylation and enhances ROR1 - dependent cell migration Prior studies found that HS1 may be constitutively phosphorylated in CLL cells . 25 , 26 Moreover , patients with CLL cells that had higher than average ratios of phosphorylated to non - phosphorylated HS1 appeared to have relatively aggressive clinical - disease progression . 26 We con ﬁ rmed that HS1 is phosphorylated at Y378 in freshly isolated CLL cells . However , culture of CLL cells in serum - free media lacking Wnt5a resulted in attrition of the levels of phosphorylation of HS1 at Y378 over time ( Supplementary Figure S1B ) . On the other hand , treatment of these CLL cells with exogenous Wnt5a induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 in such serum - starved CLL cells ( Figure 2a ) . However , treatment of these cells with cirmtuzumab inhibited the capacity of Wnt5a to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 ( Figure 2b ) , indicating the observed effect of Wnt5a on HS1 phosphorylation was dependent on ROR1 . Prior studies demonstrated that treatment of CLL cells with Wnt5a could enhance migration directed by chemokines , such as CXCL12 , and that such effects could be inhibited by cirmtuzumab . 12 We corroborated these ﬁ ndings ( Supplementary Figure S2A ) , and also found that the capacity of Wnt5a to enhance chemokine - directed CLL - cell migration could be inhibited by reducing expression of HS1 with speci ﬁ c siRNA , but not by control siRNA ( Figures 2c and d ) , suggesting a dependency on HS1 for Wnt5a - enhanced chemokine - directed CLL - cell migration . On the other hand , ibrutinib , a drug that can block BTK and inhibit B - cell receptor signaling ( Supplementary Figure S3A ) , 29 could not inhibit the capacity of Wnt5a to induce phosphorylation of HS1 ( Y378 ) or enhance the migration of CLL cells in vitro ( Supplementary Figures S3B – D ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 in MEC1 or MEC1 - ROR1 cells MEC1 cells are derived from CLL cells and have been used as a model system for studying this leukemia . 30 However , our prior studies found that MEC1 does not express ROR1 unless transfected with an expression vector encoding this orphan receptor . 12 These studies also found MEC1 cells express high levels of Wnt5a , obviating the addition of exogenous Wnt5a to the culture media . 12 Immunoblot analysis of anti - ROR1 or anti - HS1 immune precipitates revealed that ROR1 could interact with HS1 in MEC1 - ROR1 cells ( Figures 3a and b ) . As expected , ROR1 was not observed in anti - HS1 immune precipitates of lysates of MEC1 cells ( Figure 3c ) . Of note , we found MEC1 - ROR1 cells had substantially higher levels of phosphorylated HS1 than MEC1 cells , which had negligible levels of phosphorylated HS1 ( Figure 3d ) . Consistent with this effect being induced by autocrine Wnt5a , we found that an antibody capable of neutralizing Wnt5a could induce dissociation of ROR1 with HS1 ( Figure 3e ) and attrition in the levels of phosphorylated HS1 over time ( Figure 3f ) . ROR1 / HS1 interacts with ARHGEF1 and induces activation of RhoA As noted in prior studies , 12 MEC1 - ROR1 cells had enhanced activation of RhoA relative to that of MEC1 parental cells ( Supplementary Figure S2B ) . These studies also demonstrated that ARHGEF1 was recruited to ROR1 following treatment with Wnt5a , where it became activated and capable of effecting activation of RhoA . 12 Immunoblot analysis of anti - HS1 Figure 2 .

Data are shown as mean ± s . d . from three independent experiments of CLL cells from each of six patients . P o 0 . 05 ; P o 0 . 01 ; P o 0 . 001 , as assessed by two - tailed Student ’ s t - test . Wnt5a induces ROR1 to complex with HS1 MK Hasan et al 2617 Leukemia ( 2017 ) 2615 – 2622 or anti - ARHGEF1 ip from lysates of freshly isolated CLL cells revealed that HS1 was complexed with ARHGEF1 ( Figures 4a and b ) . We also found that reducing expression of HS1 using speci ﬁ c siRNA inhibited the capacity of Wnt5a to induce activation of RhoA by ip generated from anti - ARHGEF1 ( Figure 4c ) and inhibited activation of RhoA in MEC1 - ROR1 cells ( Figure 4d ) , indicating that HS1 contributed to Wnt5a - induced RhoA activation . Structural domains of ROR1 required for recruitment and activation of HS1 We examined the structural domains of ROR1 that were required for it to interact with HS1 . For this , we transfected MEC1 cells with a vector encoding either wild - type ROR1 or any one of various mutant forms of ROR1 ( Figure 5a ) . Comparable levels of wild - type ( W / T ) or truncated forms of ROR1 were expressed by each of the various transfectants ( Figure 5b and Supplementary Figure S4A ) . Moreover , comparable levels of HS1 were found in each of the various MEC1 transfectants and in the MEC1 parental cell line ( Figure 5b ) . We found that anti - ROR1 ip from lysates of MEC1 - Δ CRD - ROR1 or MEC1 - Δ KNG - ROR1 , respectively , expressing a mutant form of ROR1 lacking its extracellular cystein - rich - domain ( CRD ) or Kringle domain ( KNG ) , contained HS1 , as did the anti - ROR1 ip from lysates of MEC1 cells transfected with W / T ROR1 ( Figure 5b ) . However , the amount of HS1 protein found in the anti - ROR1 ip from lysates of MEC1 - Δ CRD - ROR1 cells was substantially less than that noted from lysates of MEC1 - ROR1 or MEC1 - Δ KNG - ROR1 cells . Furthermore , anti - ROR1 ip from lysates of MEC1 - Δ C - ROR1 or MEC1 - Δ PRD - ROR1 cells , respectively , expressing a mutant ROR1 lacking its cytoplasmic domain ( CD ) or PRD , did not contain any detectable HS1 . Finally , in contrast to MEC1 - ROR1 cells , each of MEC1 cells expressing truncated forms of ROR1 did not have detectable levels of phosphorylated HS1 , as noted for MEC1 cells lacking ROR1 ( Figure 5b ) . We examined MEC1 cells or MEC1 - ROR1 with W / T ROR1 or any one of the various truncated mutant forms of ROR1 for F - actin polymerization following treatment with CCL21 , which can induce chemotaxis of MEC1 cells or MEC1 - ROR1 cells . 12 Relatively low levels of F - actin polymerization were induced by CCL21 in MEC1 cells compared with that observed in MEC1 - ROR1 cells ( Figure 5c ) . Moreover , the levels of F - actin polymerization observed in MEC1 cells expressing any one of the truncated mutant forms of ROR1 were comparable to that observed in MEC1 cells lacking expression of ROR1 . Proline - 841 of ROR1 is necessary for effective recruitment and activation of HS1 HS1 contains an SH3 domain , which can bind to - P - X - X - P - motifs found in many proteins with PRDs , such as ROR1 . 1 , 18 – 20 , 31 Because the PRD of ROR1 was required for ROR1 to complex with HS1 , we generated various mutant forms of ROR1 with proline ( P ) to alanine ( A ) substitutions at the - P - X - X - P - motifs identi ﬁ ed in ROR1 , namely at positions 784 , 808 , 826 , 841 and 850 ( Figures 6a – c and Supplementary Figure S4B ) . ROR1 with P → A substitutions at 784 , 808 and 826 bound to HS1 as effectively as W / T ROR1 ( Supplementary Figure S5A ) . MEC1 cells transfected with each of these forms of ROR1 had enhanced chemotaxis in response to CCL21 , as did MEC - ROR1 cells expressing W / T ROR1 Figure 3 .

Wnt5a induces ROR1 to complex with HS1 MK Hasan et al 2618 Leukemia ( 2017 ) 2615 – 2622 ( Supplementary Figure S5B ) . However , a mutant with P → A substitutions at 841 and 850 in the PRD domain of ROR1 was unable to associate effectively with HS1 or enhance chemotaxis of MEC1 in response to CCL21 ( Supplementary Figure S5B ) . Thus , we generated additional mutant forms of ROR1 having a single P → A substitution at either 841 or 850 . We found that ROR1 with a P ( 850 ) A could complex with HS1 , recruit ARHGEF1 , allow for HS1 phosphorylation , RhoA activation and enhanced chemokine - directed motility of MEC1 cells as effectively as W / T ROR1 ( Figures 6d – f and Supplementary Figures S6A and B ) . However , ROR1 with a P ( 841 ) A substitution could not complex effectively with HS1 or ARHGEF in MEC1 cells or enhance phosphorylation of HS1 or activation of RhoA ( Figures 6d and e ) . Moreover , MEC1 cells transfected with ROR1 with a P ( 841 ) A substitution did not have enhanced chemokine - directed migration over that seen in MEC1 parental cells lacking ROR1 ( Figures 6f ) . DISCUSSION Here we demonstrate that ROR1 interacts with HS1 , which undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to Wnt5a in primary CLL cells and in the CLL - cell line MEC1 transfected to express ROR1 . We also found that ROR1 / HS1 interacted with ARHGEF1 , which undergoes activation , leading to the enhanced production of activated RhoA . Reducing expression of HS1 with speci ﬁ c siRNA inhibited Wnt5a - enhanced CXCL12 - directed cells migration . As such , these studies reveal an important role for HS1 in ROR1 - dependent non - canonical Wnt5a signaling important for directional migration and plantar cell polarity . Even though HS1 is a cytoplasmic protein , the extracellular domains of ROR1 contribute to the activation of HS1 in MEC1 cells . The CRD domain of ROR1 is highly conserved and serves as the putative binding site for Wnt5a , 6 , 32 – 36 whereas the KNG domain is required for ROR1 to complex with other surface proteins , such as ROR2 , in response to Wnt5a . 12 Deletion of either domain Figure 4 .

Wnt5a induces ROR1 to complex with HS1 MK Hasan et al 2619 Leukemia ( 2017 ) 2615 – 2622 abrogates the capacity of ROR1 to recruit GEFs or activate Rho GTPases . 12 We found that deletion of the CRD impaired the capacity of ROR1 to couple with HS1 in MEC1 cells relative to wild - type ROR1 or ROR1 lacking the KNG domain . That some HS1 binding was observed with ROR1 lacking the CRD may be due to steric changes in the mutant ROR1 molecule lacking the CRD , allowing for it to bind HS1 , albeit poorly , independent of Wnt5a . Furthermore , that Δ KNG - ROR1 could recruit HS1 in MEC1 cells implies that ROR1 may be able to complex with HS1 independent of its capacity to interact with other surface proteins , such as ROR2 . In any case , neither the Δ CRD - ROR1 or Δ KNG - ROR1 deletion mutant forms of ROR1 could induce HS1 phosphorylation , implying that the binding of Wnt5a and interaction with other surface proteins such as ROR2 may be required for activation of HS1 . The cytoplasmic , and more speci ﬁ cally the PRD , of ROR1 was required for it to associate with HS1 and allow for F - actin polymerization in response to Wnt5a . HS1 contains an SH3 domain , which allows it to bind proline residues within motifs that commonly are found in PRDs of other proteins . 18 – 20 , 31 Substitution of the proline residue at 841 with alanine ( ROR1 P841A ) precluded HS1 from complexing with ROR1 in MEC1 cells . Moreover , we did not observe phosphorylation of HS1 , recruitment of ARHGEF1 , activation of RhoA or enhanced chemokine - directed cell migration in MEC1 cells transfected with ROR1 P841A , in contrast to MEC1 cells transfected with wild - type ROR1 or ROR1 with alanine Figure 6 .

( d ) Interaction of ROR1 with HS1 or ARHGEF1 was con ﬁ rmed by immunoblot analysis of anti - ROR1 immune precipitates from lysates of MEC1 , MEC1 - Δ PRD , MEC1 - ROR1 ( W / T ) or MEC1 cells transfected with each of the various mutated forms of ROR1 , as indicated on the top ( upper panel ) .

( e ) Activated RhoA was measured in MEC1 ( Ctrl ) , MEC1 - Δ PRD , MEC1 - ROR1 ( W / T ) or MEC1 cells expressing any one of the mutated forms of ROR1 , as indicated on the top . ( f ) MEC1 cells expressing any one of the various constructs , as indicated at the bottom , were serum - starved overnight and examined for cell migration without ( − ) or with ( + ) CCL21 ( 200 ng / ml ) .

Wnt5a induces ROR1 to complex with HS1 MK Hasan et al 2620 Leukemia ( 2017 ) 2615 – 2622 substitutions at any other proline residue within the ROR1 PRD . As such , the proline residue at 841 appears critical for ROR1 binding to HS1 , or possibly another cytosolic protein ( s ) that in turn associates with HS1 . In any case , this residue appears necessary for ROR1 to effectively activate HS1 and enhance chemokine - directed migration of MEC1 cells . Phosphorylation of HS1 in CLL cells isolated from the blood was associated with enhanced leukemia - cell migration and unfavorable clinical outcome . 26 , 27 HS1 can undergo phosphoryla - tion in response to factors other than Wnt5a , such antigen or anti - IgM , which can induce B - cell receptor signaling . 17 , 31 However , the results of our study suggests that the factor that might contribute most to HS1 phosphorylation in circulating CLL cells is Wnt5a , which is present at high levels in the plasma of patients with CLL relative to that noted in the plasma of healthy adults . 12 Culture of CLL cells in media lacking Wnt5a resulted in rapid attrition of the levels of HS1 phosphorylation , which could be restored by treatment with exogenous Wnt5a . Furthermore , MEC1 cells did not have detectable phosphorylation of HS1 unless this cell line was transfected with ROR1 , allowing for autocrine stimulation with Wnt5a . Finally , ibrutinib , a drug that can block BTK , could not inhibit the capacity of Wnt5a to induce phosphorylation of HS1 ( Y378 ) or enhance the migration of CLL cells at concentrations that blocked B - cell receptor signaling . 29 , 37 These results imply that the correlation of HS1 phosphorylation with adverse clinical outcome may re ﬂ ect differences in Wnt5a - induced ROR1 - dependent signaling . Relevant to this are the recent ﬁ ndings that high - level expression of ROR1 in CLL is associated with enhanced ROR1 - signaling and shorter time from diagnosis to initial - therapy and decreased overall survival . 10 Previously , we found that Wnt5a could induce recruitment and activation of ARHGEF1 to ROR1 , leading to activation of RhoA . 12 However , the means for how ARHGEF1 could bind ROR1 was unknown , as this GEF did not possess an SH3 - binding domain . Here we provide evidence that binding of ARHGEF1 to ROR1 may be facilitated by HS1 , which has been found to serve as an essential adaptor protein in T - cell - receptor signaling leading to the accumulation of F - actin required to form the immune synapse . 38 Conceivably HS1 also can serve as an adapter protein for ROR1 , allowing for the recruitment and activation of ARHGEF1 and the localized activation of RhoA required for enhanced chemokine - directed cell migration . 39 Consistent with this notion is the ﬁ nding that Wnt5a did not enhance chemokine - directed chemotaxis of leukemia cells that had reduced expression of HS1 following treatment with speci ﬁ c siRNA , indicating that HS1 may play an important role in leukemia - cell migration . For sure , HS1 does plays such a role in hemapoietic cells that lack expression of ROR1 , possibly through its capacity to interact with other surface receptors , which , upon activation , require reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton for migration or cognate cell – cell interactions . 15 , 16 , 21 , 31 Indeed , HS1 can associate with the Arp2 / 3 complex to facilitate F - actin polymerization . 13 , 14 HS1 - de ﬁ cient T - cells have impaired cell motility , 16 and fail to accumulate F - actin at the immune synapse . 38 Moreover , dendritic cells from mice made de ﬁ cient in HS1 ( HS1 − / − ) have aberrant lamellipodial dynamics , loosely packed podosome arrays and impaired directional migration . 40 In such cases , HS1 associates with other binding partners to allow for such cellular functions following stimulation of surface receptors other than ROR1 , such as CXCR4 or CCR7 . 15 , 16 , 41 – 44 In any case , our studies show that in CLL cells that express ROR1 , Wnt5a can induce activation of HS1 , which may cross - talk with HS1 associated with other receptors to enhance directional leukemia - cell migration . 13 , 45 In summary , the present study describes a previously unrecog - nized ROR1 / HS1 / ARHGEF1 - dependent mechanism for activating RhoA in response to Wnt5a . The ﬁ ndings reported here demonstrate the importance of HS1 in ROR1 - dependent Wnt5a - induced signaling and highlight a pathway for potential drug development . To this end , we found that the capacity of Wnt5a to induce ROR1 to associate and activate HS1 could be blocked by cirmtuzumab , a ﬁ rst - in - class humanized anti - ROR1 mAb , which is being evaluated in patients with CLL ( https : / / clinicaltrials . gov / ct2 / show / NCT02222688 ) . 46 Moreover , we found that cirmtuzumab could block the capacity of Wnt5a to induce recruitment and activation of HS1 and ARHGEF1 to ROR1 , contributing to the noted capacity of cirmtuzumab to block ROR1 - dependent , non - canonical Wnt5a signaling responsible for enhancing leukemia - cell migration . These and other studies showing that cirmtuzumab can block survival - signaling pathways that appear unaffected by ibrutinib , 37 support the rationale for clinical evaluation of this antibody in patients with CLL .
