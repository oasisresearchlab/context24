This process , however , is only incompletely attenuated by protease inhibitor – based treatment , suggesting the existence of migratory compensation strategies . In three - dimensional collagen matrices , spindle - shaped proteolytically potent HT - 1080 ﬁbrosarcoma and MDA - MB - 231 carcinoma cells exhibited a constitutive mesenchymal - type movement including the coclustering of (cid:2) 1 integrins and MT1 – matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) at ﬁber bindings sites and the generation of tube - like proteolytic degradation tracks . Near - total inhibition of MMPs , serine proteases , cathepsins , and other proteases , however , induced a conversion toward spherical morphology at near undiminished migration rates . Sustained protease - independent migration resulted I from a ﬂexible amoeba - like shape change , i . e . , propulsive squeezing through preexisting matrix gaps and formation of constriction rings in the absence of matrix degradation , concomitant loss of clustered (cid:2) 1 integrins and MT1 - MMP from ﬁber binding sites , and a diffuse cortical distribution of the actin cytoskeleton . Acquisition of protease - independent amoeboid dissemination was conﬁrmed for HT - 1080 cells injected into the mouse dermis monitored by intravital multiphoton microscopy . In conclusion , the transition from proteolytic mesenchymal toward nonproteolytic amoeboid movement highlights a supramolecular plasticity mechanism in cell migration and further represents a putative escape mechanism in tumor cell dissemination after abrogation of pericellular proteolysis . Introduction The invasion and migration of tumor cells involves coordi - nated adhesion as well as proteolytic interaction with the ECM substrate , resulting in the degradation and remodeling of interstitial tissue barriers ( Stetler - Stevenson et al . , 1993 ) . Upon tumor progression , multiple classes of ECM - degrading enzymes are up - regulated and activated , including matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , * serine proteases , and cathepsins ( Birkedal - Hansen , 1995 ) . Fibrillar collagen , the main con - stituent of the connective tissue matrix is degraded by several proteases , including MMP - 1 , - 2 , - 8 , and - 13 , membrane - anchored MT1 - MMP , MT3 - MMP , and cathepsin B , K , and L ( Montcourrier et al . , 1990 ; Aimes and Quigley , 1995 ; Ohuchi et al . , 1997 ; Sassi et al . , 2000 ) . Accordingly , tumor cells expressing MMPs and other proteases generate proteolytic substrate degradation along their migration tracks on gelatin , matrigel , or fibronectin ( Nakahara et al . , 1997 ; d’Ortho et al . , 1998 ) . Blocking of MMPs and other proteases by pharma - cological compounds impairs invasive tumor cell behavior in different migration and invasion models in vitro ( Mignatti et al . , 1986 ; Kurschat et al . , 1999 ; Ntayi et al . , 2001 ) as well as experimental metastasis in vivo ( Coussens et al . , 2002 ; and references therein ) . Together , these findings support a concept on proteolytic path generation favoring tumor cell dissemi - nation within the tissues ( Murphy and Gavrilovic , 1999 ; Friedl and Bröcker , 2000 ) .

After blocking of MMPs or serine proteases , sig - nificant residual migration of individual cells is observed in different migration models ( Deryugina et al . , 1997 ; Hiraoka et al . , 1998 ; Kurschat et al . , 1999 ; Ntayi et al . , 2001 ) . In vivo , protease inhibitor – based targeting of MMPs and serine proteases has prompted an unexpectedly weak benefit in some animal tumor models as well as clinical trials in hu - mans , suggesting that a principal dissemination capacity re - mained intact ( Della et al . , 1999 ; Zucker et al . , 2000 ; Kruger et al . , 2001 ; Coussens et al . , 2002 ) . These studies , however , leave unresolved by which mechanisms cells may maintain migratory dissemination in the absence of ECM - degrading capacity . As one possibility , proteolytic compen - sation could be provided by enzymes not inhibited in these studies ; alternatively , cells could sustain motility via un - known protease - independent compensation strategies . To understand how proteases contribute to cell migration , the concept of pericellular proteolysis has to be integrated into the current paradigm on cell migration as a supramolec - ular process ( Lauffenburger and Horwitz , 1996 ; Friedl and Bröcker , 2000 ) . Cell migration results from a three - step cy - cle of polarized cell extension and substrate binding through leading pseudopod ( s ) , followed by actin - based contraction of the cell body and release of adhesive bonds at the trailing edge ( Palecek et al . , 1997 ) . Adhesive interaction and traction toward the ECM substrate are generated by adhesion recep - tors predominantly of the (cid:2) 1 and (cid:2) 3 integrin families ( Brooks et al . , 1996 ; Palecek et al . , 1997 ; Sheetz et al . , 1998 ) . After binding to extracellular scaffolds , integrins cluster and couple to the actin cytoskeleton to further strengthen cell – ECM linkages , which generates bipolar trac - tion between anterior and posterior cell edges to elongate the cell body toward a spindle - shaped morphology ( Sheetz et al . , 1998 ; Maaser et al . , 1999 ) . For focalized degradation of ECM substrata , integrins cooperate with cell surface pro - teases . In invasive tumor cells , (cid:3) v (cid:2) 3 integrin colocalizes with MMP - 2 ( Brooks et al . , 1996 ) and (cid:2) 1 integrins coclus - ter with MT1 - MMP ( Belkin et al . , 2001 ) , as well as the re - ceptor for urokinase - type plasminogen activator ( uPAR ) ( Wei et al . , 1996 ) . Accordingly , overexpression of uPAR and MT - MMPs favor integrin - mediated motility and invasion in two - dimensional ( 2D ) and three - dimensional ( 3D ) ECM models , respectively ( Wei et al . , 1996 ; Hiraoka et al . , 1998 ) . Consistent with migration - associated proteolysis , integrin - dependent migration of tumor cells results in the formation of tube - like matrix defects that represent paths of least resis - tance for the advancing cell body ( Friedl et al . , 1997 ) . How - ever , although proteolytic ECM degradation accompanies and augments tumor invasion and motility , it remains to be clarified whether pericellular proteolysis is indeed indispens - able for the penetration of interstitial matrix barriers .

Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy Mesenchymal – amoeboid transition in tumor cells | Wolf et al . 269 In the present study , using proteolytic tumor cells migrat - ing through 3D fibrillar collagen - rich matrix in vitro and in vivo , we have investigated to what extent abrogation of ECM - degrading capacity , including the blocking of MMPs , serine proteases , and cathepsins , impairs the migratory action . By means of time - lapse videomicroscopy and four - dimen - sional ( 4D ) confocal and multiphoton microscopy , we have particularly focused on the mechanisms of residual tumor cell movement after protease function was antagonized . Results HT - 1080 fibrosarcoma cells overexpressing the membrane - localized MT1 - MMP ( Deryugina et al . , 1997 , 1998 ) and MDA - MB - 231 mammary carcinoma cells ( Ishibashi et al . , 1999 ; Bachmeier et al . , 2001 ) were used as metastatic tumor cells capable of efficiently degrading and invading the ECM . A mesenchymal type of tumor cell migration In 3D collagen matrices , the migration of HT - 1080 / MT1 cells was characterized by polarized binding of the lead - ing edge to collagen fibers , generating traction and spin - dle - shaped elongation of the cell body ( Fig . 1 A ; Video 1 A , available online at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200209006 / DC1 ) . Both polarization and migration were abrogated by adhesion - perturbing anti – (cid:2) 1 integrin mAb 4B4 ( Fig . 1 B ; Video 1 B ) , confirming (cid:2) 1 integrin – mediated migratory force generation . MT1 - MMP and (cid:2) 1 integrins were coclustered at interaction sites to collagen fi - bers ( Fig . 1 C ) , which represented the location of initial fiber binding , traction , and bundling toward the leading edge ( Fig . 1 , D and E , white arrowheads ; Video 2 , available on - line at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200209006 / DC1 ) . Upon forward movement of the cell body , the de - tachment of the trailing edge generated a circumscribed ma - trix defect that was bordered by aligned multifibrillar col - lagen bundles ( Fig . 1 E , asterisks ; Video 2 ) . Cell detachment was further accompanied by the shedding of surface deter - minants and cell fragments along the migration track ( Fig . 1 D , black arrowhead ) . This mesenchymal migration type of spindle - shaped cells that produce matrix defects is consistent with the integrin - dependent haptokinetic migration re - ported for fibroblasts ( Doane and Birk , 1991 ; Palecek et al . , 1997 ) and further supports the concept of focalized pericel - lular proteolysis for the generation of migration tracks ( Mur - phy and Gavrilovic , 1999 ) . Inhibition of collagenolysis by protease inhibitor cocktail Pericellular degradation of native or denatured collagens can be directly or indirectly provided by proteases from different classes , including MMPs , serine proteases ( e . g . , plasmin and urokinase - type plasminogen activator [ uPA ] ) , as well as cys - teine and aspartic proteases ( e . g . , cathepsins ) ( Montcourrier et al . , 1990 ; Aimes and Quigley , 1995 ; Ohuchi et al . , 1997 ; Sassi et al . , 2000 ) . In addition to MT1 - MMP , many of these proteases , including up to five other collagenases toward na - tive type collagen ( Fig . 2 A , asterisks ) , were expressed by HT - 1080 / MT1 cells , as detected by RT - PCR . Because col - lagenolytic redundancy was anticipated , we used a cocktail of broad - spectrum protease inhibitors to simultaneously target a wide spectrum of endoproteolytic activity ( Table I ) . To maintain sufficient inhibitory activity within the matrix , the employed concentrations of protease inhibitors were orders of magnitudes higher than the known maximum inhibitory values , unless cell viability was dose limiting ( Table I ) . Be - cause most of the proteases detectable by RT - PCR escape vi - Figure 2 . Protease expression in HT - 1080 / MT1 cells and inhibition of collagenolysis .

On a qualitative basis , structural break - down of the matrix fibers caused by HT - 1080 / MT1 cells ( Fig . 2 B , 1 and 3 ) was fully abrogated in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail ( Fig . 2 B , 2 ) . This strong inhibi - tory effect was confirmed by a quantitative 3D fluorometric fluorescein ( FITC ) release assay , detecting the degradation of FITC - labeled collagen fibers ( Fig . 2 C ) . Upon migration within FITC – collagen , HT - 1080 / MT1 cells released 20 % of the total FITC content ( Fig . 2 D ) , confirming the ob - served macroscopic ( Fig . 2 B , 1 ) and microscopic collagen fi - ber degradation ( Fig . 1 E ; Fig . 2 B , 3 ) . Protease inhibitor cocktail inhibited 95 % of the cell - mediated FITC release generated by HT - 1080 / MT1 cells ( Fig . 2 D ) and to the same residual level in vector - transfected HT - 1080 / neo cells ( unpublished data ) . Broad - range MMP inhibitor BB - 2516 ( marimastat ) alone abrogated (cid:6) 80 % of the FITC release in HT - 1080 / MT1 cells , suggesting a major contribution of MMPs to the degradation of collagen ( Fig . 2 D ) . Unexpectedly , although inhibition of collagenolysis by protease inhibitor cocktail was near complete , the migration efficiency of HT - 1080 / MT1 cells within 3D collagen lat - tices was barely reduced ( Fig . 3 ) . Persistent migration was monitored by sensitive real - time analysis of time - dependent population speed ( Fig . 3 A ) and the median speed derived from single cell analysis ( Fig . 3 B ) . Similar high migration rates were obtained by BB - 2516 alone as well as from HT - 1080 / neo and wild - type cells in the presence of inhibitor cocktail ( unpublished data ) . Because the capacity to move , i . e . , to generate traction and overcome physical matrix con - straints appeared intact after blocking of collagenolysis , we hypothesized the existence of compensation strategies to counterbalance the loss of pericellular proteolysis . Induced amoeboid migration in vitro As it became apparent from the video recordings ( Video 3 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200209006 / DC1 ) , the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail changed several aspects of migratory behavior in HT - 1080 / MT1 cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Whereas spontaneously mov - ing cells maintained a spindle - shaped , elongated morphology ( Fig . 4 A , left ) , this mesenchymal migration type was con - verted to less polarized , more spherical morphodynamics in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail ( Fig . 4 A , right ; Video 3 ) . Spherical - shaped cells sustained migration ( Fig . 4 B ) and exhibited a significant reduction in median axis length compared with control cells ( Fig . 4 C ) . In the presence of protease inhibitors , spherical morphodynamics included flexible shape change and forward propulsion guided by mul - tiple anterior and outward ruffling filopodia , as detected by high resolution video microscopy ( Video 4 , available on - line at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200209006 / DC1 ) .

Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy Mesenchymal – amoeboid transition in tumor cells | Wolf et al . 271 MDA - MB - 231 mammary carcinoma cells , expressing soluble MMPs , MT - MMPs , serine proteases , and cathepsins ( Ishiba - shi et al . , 1999 ; Bachmeier et al . , 2001 ) . Inhibition of pro - teolysis in MDA - MB - 231 cells by protease inhibitor cocktail ( Fig . 4 D ) , albeit slightly less efficient than in HT - 1080 cells , resulted in a similar transition from constitutive spindle shape to less polarized , elliptoid morphodynamics ( Fig . 4 E ; Video 5 , available online at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200209006 / DC1 ) , including a significantly short - ened median axis length ( Fig . 4 F ) . This novel nonproteolytic phenotype in HT - 1080 / MT1 and MDA - MB - 231 cells was reminiscent of Dictyostelium amoeba migrating across 2D surfaces ( Yumura et al . , 1984 ; Killich et al . , 1993 ) as well as leukocytes crawling through 3D ECM substrata ( Gunzer et al . , 2000 ; Friedl et al . , 2001 ; for comparison , see migrating T lymphocytes in Gunzer et al . [ 2000 ] supplemental material ) . Morphometric analysis showed a reduced number in mesenchymally moving cells in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail , whereas the per - centage of the more spherical “amoeboid” phenotype was at least tripled ( Fig . 4 G ) or doubled by BB - 2516 alone ( un - published data ) . Mechanisms of induced nonproteolytic migration Consistent with impaired collagenolysis , amoeboid moving HT - 1080 / MT1 cells did not cause structural remodeling of collagen fibers ( Video 6 , available online at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200209006 / DC1 ) . In - duced protease - independent migration resulted from adap - tation and alignment of the cell body along preformed fiber strands ( Fig . 5 A , white arrowheads ) and consecutive migra - tory guidance along fibrillar scaffolds ( Fig . 5 B , black arrow - heads ) . Upon cell detachment , no remodeling , bundling , or destruction of the collagen network was generated , leaving behind the intact reticular texture of individual fibrils at their original position ( Fig . 5 A , black arrowheads ; Video 6 ) . To overcome regions of narrow space by changing shape , an initial pseudopod elongation through a preformed matrix gap ( 4 (cid:4) m pore diameter from the central section , 18 (cid:4) m cell diameter ; Fig . 5 C , black arrowhead ) was followed by propulsion of the cell body and the development of a narrow region confined by matrix fibers ( constriction ring ; Lewis , 1934 ; Fig . 5 C , black arrowhead ) . Constriction rings per - sisted until the cell body had squeezed or pulled forward , while no matrix defect was apparent after cell detachment ( Fig . 5 C ; Video 7 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200209006 / DC1 ) . Because the structure and location of adhesive cell – matrix contacts control cell shape and migration dynamics ( Palecek et al . , 1997 ; Sheetz et al . , 1998 ) , we investigated the cyto - skeletal structure and integrin distribution in amoeboid HT - 1080 / MT1 cells . Induced amoeboid morphology was char - acterized by diffuse cortical actin rims and small actin - rich spots at interactions with collagen fibers ( Fig . 5 D ) . In amoeboid HT1080 / MT1 cells , (cid:2) 1 integrins showed non - clustered , linear surface distribution at contacts to collagen Figure 4 .

MT1 - MMP was consistently dissociated from fiber binding sites but accumu - lated intracellularly ( Fig . 5 E ) . Mesenchymal – amoeboid transition in vivo Although collagen lattices provide a complex 3D ECM scaf - fold and a barrier for moving cells , a putatively different spacing and molecular composition of life connective tis - sue may impose additional physical and molecular con - straints , putatively yielding in distinct migration mechanisms . Therefore , the in vivo migration of HT - 1080 / MT1 cells within the mouse dermis was investigated by multiphoton microscopy . 3 h after the injection of HT - 1080 / MT1 cells into the loose connective tissue of the mouse dermis ( Fig . 6 A ) , both nontreated control cells ( green ) and cells pretreated with protease inhibitor cocktail ( red ) were detected at and passively scattered around the injection site ( Fig . 6 A , aster - isk ) , or located within multicellular cords ( Fig . 6 A , black ar - rowheads ) . In wash - out experiments in vitro , preincubation of cells with protease inhibitor cocktail for 6 h resulted in stable amoeboid movement for at least 10 h before rever - sion toward mesenchymal migration occurred ( unpublished data ) , indicating both relatively slow turnover of the target proteases after inhibition and full reversibility of inhibitor - induced phenotypic change . In the dermis , ortotopic 3D re - construction of the injection site 3 and 8 h after injection identified considerable position changes for both control cells ( Fig . 6 B , top ) and inhibitor - pretreated HT - 1080 / MT1 cells ( Fig . 6 B , bottom ) . This position change corresponded to a translocation of 4 – 10 (cid:4) m / hr ( Fig . 6 B , white arrow - heads ) , in part approximating migration velocities present in collagen matrices in vitro ( 6 – 36 (cid:4) m / h ; compare Fig . 3 B ) . At high - resolution reconstruction , cells pretreated with pro - tease inhibitors developed a significantly reduced elongation , reminiscent of amoeboid morphology ( Fig . 6 C , red cells ) , and a near - round median shape ( Fig . 6 D ) , whereas control cells retained their constitutive spindle - like elongation ( Fig . 6 C , green cells ; Video 8 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200209006 / DC1 ) . In summary , simi - lar to 3D collagen matrices , abrogation of matrix protease function in HT - 1080 / MT1 cells was followed by cell move - ment and concomitant induction of amoeboid morphology Figure 5 .

Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy Mesenchymal – amoeboid transition in tumor cells | Wolf et al . 273 in vivo , confirming migratory plasticity for dermal connec - tive tissue . Discussion The transition from proteolytic and “mesenchymal” to pro - tease independent and “amoeboid” movement reveals a novel cellular and molecular adaptation pathway in sustain - ing cell migration : the switch from a path - generating to a path - finding migration mode that we have termed mesen - chymal – amoeboid transition ( MAT ) . Although proteases were used for constitutive migration of proteolytic cells of mesenchymal and epithelial origin , abrogation of pericellu - lar proteolysis was followed by nonproteolytic movement . MAT thus represents a compensatory migration mode in vitro and in vivo to bypass physical matrix resistance by amoeboid shape change . Constitutive proteolytic migration of mesenchymal cells Important concepts on cell migration are derived from the movement of fibroblasts and myoblasts ( Lauffenburger and Horwitz , 1996 ) . In 3D in vitro and in vivo tissues , fibro - blasts develop elongated , spindle - shaped morphology medi - ated by cortical F - actin and occasional stress fibers ( Welch et al . , 1990 ) . Fibroblast migration is dependent on (cid:2) 1 inte - grin function ( Doane and Birk , 1991 ) and is further cou - pled to the cleavage and remodeling of ECM components using MMPs and other proteases ( Langholz et al . , 1995 ) . A similar type of mesenchymal behavior is developed by HT - 1080 fibrosarcoma cells and MDA - MB - 231 mammary car - cinoma cells in 3D collagen matrices . These cells move as individual spindle - shaped cells that utilize (cid:2) 1 integrin – mediated binding to collagen fibers for elongation and trans - location . Similarly to fibroblasts , a range of ECM - degrading enzymes is expressed , coclustered with integrins at interac - tions to substrate , and used for the generation of tube - like matrix defects that correspond to known clearance tracks in other models ( Nakahara et al . , 1997 ; d’Ortho et al . , 1998 ) . Because the cell diameter of mesenchymal - like cells exceeds the mean pore size within the fiber network ( Friedl et al . , 1997 ) , contact - dependent focal degradation of collagen barriers may facilitate migration by locally lowering the physical resistance of the ECM barrier ( Murphy and Gavrilovic , 1999 ) .

Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy 274 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 160 , Number 2 , 2003 Constitutive nonproteolytic amoeboid migration strategies In some cell types , migration results from more dynamic , transient and less defined cell – substrate contacts associated with amoeboid shape ( Friedl and Bröcker , 2000 ; Friedl et al . , 2001 ; and references therein ) . The concept of amoeboid movement is most clearly established from the single cell state of the lower eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum . Dic - tyostelium is an elliptoid cell that translocates via rapidly al - ternating cycles of morphological expansion and contrac - tion , relatively low - affinity integrin - independent interactions with the substrate , and extraordinary deformability ( Yumura et al . , 1984 ; Devreotes and Zigmond , 1988 ; Killich et al . , 1993 ; Friedl et al . , 2001 ) . In higher eukaryotic cells , such as leukocytes and certain types of tumor cells , hallmarks of amoeboid motion are retained , including rapid low affinity gliding coupled to shape change , squeezing through pre - formed matrix gaps , and propulsive elongation along paths of least resistance ( Lewis , 1934 ; Schor et al . , 1983 ; Friedl et al . , 1998 , 2001 ) . In collagen matrices , T cell migration is in - dependent of structural matrix remodeling ( Schor et al . , 1983 ) and it is not sensitive to protease inhibitor treatment ( unpublished data ) or the inhibition of (cid:2) 1 integrin function , the latter both in vitro and in vivo ( Friedl et al . , 1998 ; Brakebusch et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , amoeboid migration appears to comprise morphodynamic supramolecular mechanisms to bypass tissue barriers independent of ECM degradation . Mesenchymal – amoeboid transition : induced amoeboid migration In HT - 1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA - MB - 231 mammary carcinoma cells , the mechanism of sustained migration after abrogation of pericellular proteolysis was a striking change in cell morphology and migration “style” reminiscent of transition toward amoeboid movement . To provide maxi - mum inhibition efficiency , five pharmacological inhibitors were used to simultaneously target different protease classes known to contribute to ECM degradation and remodeling , including MMPs , serine proteases , and cathepsins , all of which are expressed by HT - 1080 and MDA - MB - 231 cells . We reasoned that more specific approaches , such as genetic ablation of individual proteases , might be hampered by pro - teolytic redundancy and functional compensation . The effectiveness of the protease inhibition strategy was shown by a combined biochemical and structural approach : ( a ) near - total inhibition of FITC release using FITC - labeled fibrillar collagen ; ( b ) abrogation of macroscopic structural degradation of the collagen lattice by HT - 1080 cells ; and ( c ) the lack of newly generated tube - like matrix defects in the wake of the cells visualized by 4D confocal backscatter microscopy . Inhibition of constitutive proteolysis , instead of causing the cells to become “trapped” within the fibrillar network , induced a program of morphodynamic and molecular changes that allowed the maintenance of the migratory ac - tion ( Fig . 7 ) . These changes included a reduced elongation yet increased morphodynamic flexibility , the loss of focal (cid:2) 1 integrin and MT1 - MMP clustering at interactions with ma - trix fibers , and a more diffuse cortical actin distribution , in - cluding small actin - rich nucleation foci at fiber binding sites . These features are coupled to the forward flow ( streaming ) of cytoplasm through cell regions of narrow space confined by outside constriction and , together , result in a phenotype mimicking amoeboid moving cells ( Yumura et al . , 1984 ; Devreotes and Zigmond , 1988 ; Killich et al . , 1993 ; Friedl et al . , 2001 ) . Because this induced amoeboid behavior gener - ated significant migratory activity , yet the transmigrated col - lagen architecture remained intact by means of biochemical and structural analysis , our data show an alternative inhibi - tor - induced nonproteolytic migration type ( Fig . 7 ) . Induced protease - independent movement was observed for two different collagen - based tissue models , 3D collagen lattices in vitro and the mouse dermis in vivo . As recon - structed by intravital microscopy , the loose connective tissue of the mouse dermis exhibits strong structural similarity to 3D collagen matrices . Both models provide 3D fibrillar col - lagenous strands bordering matrix gaps in the range of 1 – 15 (cid:4) m ( unpublished data ) . Migratory alignment and shape change of tumor cells ( cell diameter in the range of 15 – 25 (cid:4) m [ Friedl et al . , 1997 ] ; 10 – 30 - fold larger in volume than amoeba or leukocytes ) along preformed fiber strands may hence be sustained by constriction of the cell body and pro - pulsion of the cytoplasm through narrow space as a nonpro - teolytic , physical strategy to bypass structural ECM barriers . Although the spacing of such loose connective tissue sup - ports protease - independent cell movement , future studies will be necessary to determine under which conditions trans - migration of more densely interconnected ECM , such as basement membranes , can occur by nonproteolytic means . The finding that blocking proteases induces transition from a mesenchymal phenotype to amoeboid movement sheds light on how disseminating tumor cells may react in response to protease inhibitor – based therapy . In established tumor disease , tumor cells have already reached interstitial tissue compartments ( Stetler - Stevenson et al . , 1993 ) that are likely to support shape - driven migration independent of pericellular proteolysis . Therefore , protease - independent tu - mor cell dissemination may represent a candidate escape Figure 7 . Concept on mesenchymal – amoeboid transition . A program of morphodynamic and molecular changes after abrogation of peri - cellular proteolysis by protease inhibitors provides a supramolecular mechanism for persistent nonproteolytic migration in 3D fibrillar collagenous tissues . Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy Mesenchymal – amoeboid transition in tumor cells | Wolf et al . 275 mechanism upon protease inhibitor – based treatment of pro - gressive cancer disease ( Zucker et al . , 2000 ; Kruger et al . , 2001 ; Coussens et al . , 2002 ) . Molecular implications of MAT The putative mechanistic link between loss of pericellular proteolysis and MAT can be best explained by changes in cell – matrix interaction strength . Although different experi - mental systems are difficult to directly relate , exaggerated mesenchymal - like phenotypes can be induced by strength - ening cell – ECM contacts or reducing their turnover : by sta - bilizing interactions toward collagen fibers after arresting (cid:2) 1 integrins in a high - affinity ligand - bound state ( Maaser et al . , 1999 ) or by stabilizing stress fibers leading to spread - out , elongated morphology through activation of the small GTP - ase Rho ( Nobes and Hall , 1999 ) . Conversely , reduced axis length and amoeba - like morphodynamics may emerge from weakening substrate - binding strength : by reducing integrin adhesive function ( Dufour et al . , 1988 ) or by inhibiting Rho - kinase ( Nobes and Hall , 1999 ) . In addition to inte - grins , several of the proteases blocked in this study are known to regulate cellular morphodynamics by other mech - anisms , including a mesenchymal phenotype ( Lochter et al . , 1997 ) . MMP - 3 overexpression in epithelial cells leads to the cleavage of E - cadherin and induces epithelial – mesenchymal transition , i . e . , single cell detachment and mesenchymal in - vasion ( Lochter et al . , 1997 ) . Proteases further control cell adhesion , cytoskeletal organization , and the release of solu - ble factors ( Sternlicht and Werb , 2001 ; and references therein ) . These functions comprise cleavage of adhesion re - ceptors ( e . g . , L - selectin ) ; cleavage and activation of cytokines ( e . g . , IL - 1 and TNF - (cid:3) ) or growth factors ( e . g . , EGF and bFGF ) ; and the regulation of focal contact assembly and turnover by cleavage of talin or integrin cytoplasmic do - mains through , for example , calpain . The identification of pathways involved in MAT will thus require further studies on different cytoskeletal and signaling checkpoints that con - trol cell shape and cell – matrix interactions . MAT : comparison to other morphodynamic processes Plasticity and adaptation in cell behavior are well established in other morphodynamic processes governed by cell – cell and cell – substrate interactions . In epithelial – mesenchymal transition , a usually nonmigrating epithelial collective aban - dons cell – cell cohesion after cadherin - mediated cell – cell contacts are weakened , allowing detachment of single cells and conversion toward mesenchymal morphology and mi - gration ( Birchmeier and Birchmeier , 1995 ) . In another ex - ample , differentiating muscle precursor cells quit cell move - ment and fuse via N - and E - cadherin to form a multicellular contractile syncythium ( Redfield et al . , 1997 ) . In conclu - sion , MAT may represent a novel transient morphodynamic alteration and adaptation pathway in molecular cell dynam - ics . Stringent , adhesive , and proteolytic cell – ECM contacts , as developed by mesenchymally moving cells , can be con - verted toward less well characterized , more diffuse , and less proteolytic interactions with extracellular scaffolds , reminis - cent of amoeboid single cell movement . Residual amoeboid movement may hence represent a robust “salvage” pathway of cell movement in loose connective tissue after the abroga - tion of pericellular proteolysis . Materials and methods Cell migration in 3D collagen matrices : reconstruction by time - lapse video microscopy and confocal microscopy Subconfluent HT - 1080 fibrosarcoma cells stably transfected with MT1 - MMP ( Deryugina et al . , 1997 ) or MDA - MB - 231 breast carcinoma cells ( Ishibashi et al . , 1999 ; Bachmeier et al . , 2001 ) were detached by EDTA ( 2 mM ) , washed , incorporated into 3 - D collagen lattices ( 1 . 67 mg / ml ; native dermal bovine type I collagen ; Vitrogen ; Cohesion Inc . ) , and monitored by time - lapse video microscopy ( Friedl et al . , 1997 ; Gunzer et al . , 2000 ) . The collagen was resistant to trypsin and sensitive to degradation by MT1 - MMP ( not depicted ) , confirming its native state . HT - 1080 / MT1 cells served as model for high constitutive collagenase expression and activity , allow - ing a robust visualization of surface MT1 - MMP and fiber breakdown in the process of migration . In control experiments , HT1080 / neo cells as well as HT - 1080 wild - type cells were used for collagen degradation and migration experiments yielding similar results , including MAT ( not depicted ) . For in - hibition studies , blocking anti – (cid:2) 1 integrin mAb 4B4 ( 10 (cid:4) g / ml ; Coulter ) or protease inhibitor cocktail ( Table I ) was added to the lattice before poly - merization as well as to the supernatant . Protease inhibitor cocktail con - sisted of BB - 2516 ( marimastat ; provided by British Biotech Inc . ) , leupeptin ( Molecular Probes ) , pepstatin A , E - 64 , and aprotinin ( all from Sigma - Aldrich ) . Protease inhibitor cocktail did not affect cell viability in collagen after 48 h , as assessed after cell release from the collagen lattice by colla - genase digestion , propidium iodide staining , and flow cytometry , or upon liquid culture after 72 h of exposure . For 3D time - lapse confocal microscopy ( Leica - SP2 system ) , cells within the lattice were labeled by calcein - AM ( 1 (cid:4) M ) , scanned at 2 . 5 - min time intervals for simultaneous fluorescence and backscatter signal , and recon - structed ( Friedl et al . , 1997 ) . MT1 - MMP and (cid:2) 1 integrins were detected by rabbit AB815 ( Chemicon ) , secondary rhodamine - conjugated goat anti – rabbit Fab’ fragments ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) , and a cock - tail of FITC - labeled mAb 4B4 and K20 ( Coulter ) , respectively . Computer - assisted cell tracking and reconstruction of cell morphology Locomotor parameters were obtained by computer - assisted cell tracking and reconstruction of the x and y coordinates of the cell paths ( Maaser et al . , 1999 ) . The population speed was calculated from each 15 - min track - ing interval for all cells divided by the number of cells . Single cell speed represents the total length of the path divided by time . The proportion of mesenchymal to amoeboid migration was assessed 9 h ( HT1080 / MT1 ) or 18 h ( MDA - MB - 231 ) after addition of protease inhibitor cocktail by visual blinded analysis for a 60 - min time interval by two independent observers . Cells of indeterminate morphology representing either transition states of partially elongated , dividing , or nonmigrating cells precluded clear catego - rization and were excluded from analysis ( 15 – 40 % of total population ) . In control cells , indeterminate morphology was seen in 20 % of the cells , mainly representing dividing cells and periods of retraction of otherwise elongated mobile cells ( see Video 3 ) . In the presence of inhibitor cocktail , the indeterminate fraction was increased to 40 % , containing an additional subset of partially retracted cells ( elongation index (cid:6) 2 ) that lacked the cri - teria of full amoeboid as well as mesenchymal morphodynamics ( Video 3 ) . Elongation was calculated from still frames as elongation index for each cell ( axis length divided by width ) and displayed as box - blot ranging from the 25th to 75th percentile including the median and whiskers from the 5th to 95th percentile . Unless indicated otherwise , statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired two - tailed Mann - Whitney U test . RT - PCR Primers and RT - PCR conditions were used as previously described ( Hof - mann et al . , 1999 ; Konttinen et al . , 1999 ; McCulloch et al . , 2000 ) . Addi - tional primers were cathepsin B , 5 (cid:10) - GCCTGCAAGCTTCGATGCAC - 3 (cid:10) ( di - rect ) and 5 (cid:10) - CTATTGGAGACGCTGTAGGA - 3 (cid:10) ( reverse ) ; cathepsin D , 5 (cid:10) - CCAGCCCCCAATCCCAACCCCACCTCCAG - 3 (cid:10) ( direct ) and 5 (cid:10) - CACT - GAAGCTGGGAGGCAAAGGCTACAAGC - 3 (cid:10) ( reverse ) ; cathepsin K , 5 (cid:10) - TCC - ATCCATAACCTTGAGGCTT - 3 (cid:10) ( direct ) and 5 (cid:10) - CCACAGCCATCATTCT - CAGACACA - 3 (cid:10) ( reverse ) ; cathepsin L , 5 (cid:10) - CAGGCAGGTGATGAATGGCT - 3 (cid:10) ( direct ) and 5 (cid:10) - CAGGCCTCCATTATCCTGAA - 3 (cid:10) ( reverse ) ; MT1 - MMP , 5 (cid:10) - CCCTATGCCTACATCCGTGA - 3 (cid:10) ( direct ) and 5 (cid:10) - TCCATCCATCACTTG - GTTAT - 3 (cid:10) ( reverse ) ; u - PAR , 5 (cid:10) - GGTCACCCGCCGCTG - 3 (cid:10) ( direct ) and 5 (cid:10) - Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy 276 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 160 , Number 2 , 2003 CCACTGCGGTACTGGACA - 3 (cid:10) ( reverse ) ; u - PA , 5 (cid:10) - AAAATGCTGTGTGCT - GCTGACC - 3 (cid:10) ( direct ) and 5 (cid:10) - CCCTGCCCTGAAGTCGTTAGTG - 3 (cid:10) ( re - verse ) ; and PAI - 1 , 5 (cid:10) - GAACAAGGATGAGATCAGCACC - 3 (cid:10) ( direct ) and 5 (cid:10) - ACTATGACAGCTGTGGATGAGG - 3 (cid:10) ( reverse ) . Uniqueness of region was confirmed using the NCBI blastn program ; specificity was determined from the length of each PCR product . Total RNA was isolated ( QIAGEN RNA - Easy kit ) , transcribed to cDNA by AMV reverse transcriptase , and amplified by PCR ( 30 cycles ) . Absence of cDNA contamination was confirmed by subjecting total cell lysates to PCR in the absence of reverse transcriptase . Collagen degradation assays HT - 1080 / MT1 or MDA - MB - 231 cell suspension was copolymerized with nonlabeled rat tail collagen ( Becton Dickinson ) containing 2 % FITC - labeled collagen monomers ( Molecular Probes ) . After migration for 40 h , solid - phase collagen containing the cells was pelleted , while FITC released into the supernatant was analyzed by spectrofluorometry . 100 % values were obtained by complete collagenase digestion of cell - free collagen lat - tices . Background fluorescence was calculated by pelleting nondigested cell - free lattices . No autofluorescence was detected for either cells or in - hibitors . FITC – collagen was sensitive to degradation by recombinant MT1 - MMP , MMP - 2 , and trypsin . While FITC release detected both classical collagenases as well as trypsin - like activity , FITC release induced by HT - 1080 / MT1 cells was reduced by 80 % by the MMP inhibitor BB - 2516 ( Fig . 2 C ) , indicating MMPs as primary collagenases in these cells . To exclude that FITC release merely reflected telopeptidase activity and incomplete fi - ber degradation , 500 , 000 HT1080 / MT1 cells in a drop of medium were placed onto native nonlabeled 3D collagen ( 100 (cid:4) m in depth ) . Fiber breakdown was detected after 40 h by Coomassie blue staining and confo - cal backscatter microscopy . Intravital multiphoton microscopy Reconstruction of HT1080 / MT1 cell positioning and ECM structure were monitored by multiphoton microscopy ( Maiti et al . , 1997 ) of the mouse dermis in adult C57BL / 6 mice , using a novel modification of a bone mar - row intravital video microscopy model ( Mazo et al . , 1998 ) . The epidermis and upper dermis , including hair follicles of the frontoparietal scalp , were removed by careful separation from the underlying connective tissue using microscissors . A fixation ring was inserted into the incision to spread the skin , and Hepes - buffered medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum was applied . Subconfluent HT - 1080 / MT1 cells were preincubated for 3 – 4 h in protease inhibitor cocktail ( each 20 (cid:4) M BB - 2516 , pepstatin A , E - 64 , 0 . 7 (cid:4) M aprotinin , 2 (cid:4) M leupeptin ) or medium alone . Control cells and inhibi - tor cocktail – treated cells were labeled with calcein - AM ( green ) or TRITC ( red ) , respectively , washed twice , suspended together in medium ( 10 4 cells / 3 (cid:4) l each ) , and carefully injected into the mid - dermis over the immo - bilized mouse scull . After injection , a temperature of 37 (cid:11) C was maintained by a water circulation system through the fixation ring and the use of a tempered water immersion objective . Intravital multiphoton microscopy was performed on an Olympus BX 50 WI microscope coupled to a Ti : Sap - phire laser ( Spectraphysics ) and a Radiance 2000MP confocal multiphoton imaging system controlled by the Lasersharp software ( all from Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Multiphoton excitation light of 800 nm was introduced into the sample . Connective tissue structures were visualized via autofluores - cence and second harmonic generation imaging at 400 / 40 nm . Labeled tu - mor cells were detected at 525 / 30 nm ( calcein - AM ) and 600 / 100 nm ( TRITC ) . Image reconstruction from z - series scans up to a penetration depth of 800 (cid:4) m was performed using the freeware Confocal Assistant © .
