These domains regulate subcellular localization and protein function by bind - ing to lipid ligands embedded in cell membranes . Structural and biochemical analysis of these domains has shown that their molecular mechanisms of membrane bind - ing depend on a combination of speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc interactions with membrane lipids . In vivo studies of green ﬂuorescent protein fusions have highlighted the key roles of these domains in regulating protein localization to plasma and internal membranes in cells .

Localization to different cell compartments is often brought about by protein - protein interaction domains ( 70 , 100 ) . Another major class of subcellular targeting domains binds speciﬁcally to lipid ligands in cell membranes . The best known members of this group are the protein kinase C ( PKC ) homology - 1 ( C1 ) ( 54 , 111 ) and - 2 ( C2 ) domains ( 89 , 110 ) , the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain ( 8 , 34 , 73 , 109 ) , and the FYVE domain ( 34 , 42 , 141 ) . Although some C1 , C2 , and PH domains interact with proteins in addition to—or instead of—lipids , their best known roles are in lipid binding . This review emphasizes the membrane - binding mechanisms of these domains and their role in cell signaling . These are exciting times for research on signal transduction domains . Studies of green ﬂuorescent protein fusions with signaling proteins are yielding quantitative kinetic information in living cells . The three - dimensional structures of the C1 , C2 , FYVE , and PH domains have all been solved at high resolution by X - ray crystallo - graphy , and they have also been studied by nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) and electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) . Site - directed mutagenesis , ﬂuores - cence , and surface pressure studies have made critical contributions to under - standing how these proteins interact with membranes . Databases such as SMART ( 115 ; http : / / www . coot . embl - heidelberg . de / SMART ) and Pfam ( 6 ; http : / / www . sanger . ac . uk / Software / Pfam ) providethemostcomprehensivecensusyetofsignal - transducing domains . With the rapid growth of interest in membrane targeting as a mechanism for signal transduction , these developments are due for review . A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l .

MEMBRANE - BINDING DOMAINS 51 C1 DOMAINS The C1 domain is a compact zinc - containing motif of (cid:24) 50 amino acid residues , formerly known as a “cysteine - rich” domain ( Figure 1 a ) . The C1 domain was discovered as a conserved region responsible for the allosteric activation of PKC isozymes ( PKCs ) by diacylglycerol and phorbol esters . C1 domains are now known to occur not only in PKCs but in > 200 different proteins in the nonredundant Figure 1 a . Alignment of C1 domains . Zn 2 + - liganding residues are shown in bold .

P1 : FRK April 18 , 2000 17 : 43 Annual Reviews AR098 - 03 ? 52 HURLEY ¥ MISRA sequence databases [ these numbers , obtained from the SMART database ( 115 ) , arehigherthanquotedelsewhereowingbothtonewdiscoveriesandtotheinclusionoforthologs ] . Some of these proteins , including PKCs , the chimaerins , Unc - 13 ( 54 , 111 ) , and RasGRP ( 24 , 111 ) , are effectors of diacylglycerol . However , many of the known C1 domains do not bind diacylglycerol . This group of C1 domains is referred to as “atypical , ” and they are implicated in interactions with small G - proteins and membrane lipids other than diacylglycerol . Structure of the C1 Domain C1 domains contain two small (cid:12) sheets and a short C - terminal (cid:11) - helix that are built around two 3 - Cys – 1 - His Zn 2 + - binding clusters ( 52 , 146 ; Figure 2 a —see color insert ) . The Zn 2 + ions are an integral part of the structure . The diacylglycerol - and phorbol ester - binding site is formed at one tip of the domain , where part of the second (cid:12) sheet unzips . The linked ring structures of phorbol are inserted lengthwise into the narrow groove at the tip of the C1 domain . The 3 - and 20 - oxygens of phorbol interact with main - chain groups exposed by unzipping of two (cid:12) strands ( Figure 1 b ) . One of the acyl group oxygens and the 3 - hydroxyl of diacylglycerol are believed to occupy the same sites , whereas it is less clear how the second acyl group oxygen interacts . Diacylglycerol - Promoted Membrane Association One entire end of the C1 domain surrounding the binding groove is almost com - pletely hydrophobic ( Figure 2 a ) . The region adjoins a basic ring that circumscribes the midsection of the domain surface . NMR studies in short - chain lipid micelles ( 145 ) and surface pressure analysis of C1 domain mutants of PKC (cid:11) ( 84 ) con - ﬁrmed the prediction that the hydrophobic region penetrates into the membrane interior while the basic ring contacts the membrane surface ( 146 ) . There is an exceptionally strong synergism between diacylglycerol or phorbol ester binding and membrane binding ( 86 ) , and the presence of diacylglycerol or phorbol ester is required for targeting of C1 domains to membranes . The monomeric phorbol ester head group binds 10 4 - fold more weakly than tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate presented in mixed micelles ( 63 ) . The synergistic binding is explained by the two types of binding surfaces : a stereospeciﬁc diacylglycerol - phorbol ester - binding site in a groove surrounded by a nonstereospeciﬁc membrane - binding site . Bind - ing of either diacylglycerol or bulk membrane to its site alone leaves interactions with other sites unsatisﬁed ; hence simultaneous binding is favored . C1 domains from PKC γ can translocate from the cytosol to the plasma mem - brane within a few seconds after addition of diacylglycerol ( 95 ) . Free fatty acids can stimulate PKC translocation to a variety of different cell compartments de - pending on the isozyme ( 117 ) , yet speciﬁc binding to PKC C1 and C2 domains has not been documented . Free fatty acids could modulate the nonspeciﬁc interactions of PKC - C1 or PKC - C2 with membranes . A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l . S t r u c t . 2000 . 29 : 49 - 79 .

MEMBRANE - BINDING DOMAINS 53 Predicting C1 Domain Function from Sequence The structure of the C1 - phorbol ester complex and its nonspeciﬁc membrane - binding surface depend on the conservation of a number of amino acids in the group of “typical” C1 domains that do bind diacylglycerol and phorbol ester ( Figure 1 a ) . The typical C1 domains conserve both the large hydrophobic residues that form the nonspeciﬁc binding surface and three structural residues ( a Pro , Gly , and Gln ) involved in the stabilization of the binding groove ( 64 , 146 ) . Counting from the ﬁrst conserved His , the consensus motif for the typical C1 domains be - gins at Pro - 11 : PXArCX 2 CX 2 Hy 3 GX 0 - 1 HyX 2 QG , where X is any amino acid ; Ar is Phe , Trp , or Tyr ; Hy is any hydrophobic residue ; and residues involved in groove formation or membrane penetration are shown in bold ( 64 , 146 ) . This signature is inconsistent with the properties of synthetic peptide models for PKC C1 domains ( 58 ) , although the motif has been largely successful in predicting the properties of naturally occurring and recombinant C1 domain - containing proteins . For ex - ample , this motif is present in the most recently discovered C1 domain , that of RasGRP ( 24 ) . RasGRP is targeted to cell membranes in response to diacylglyc - erol via its C1 domain ( 131 ) , revealing a new pathway from diacylglycerol to Ras signaling . Atypical C1 domains occur in two large groups of proteins : the diacylglyc - erol kinases ( DAGKs ) ( 132 ) and effectors and regulators of small G - proteins . The function of the DAGK C1 domains is mysterious . None of these kinases is known to bind phorbol ester , and the C1 domains of DAGK (cid:11) are dispensable for cat - alytic activity ( 113 , 132 ) . The atypical C1 domain of Raf is involved in allosteric regulation of this protein kinase by activated Ras , although the primary bind - ing site for Ras lies elsewhere , on the Raf - RBD domain . Several regions on the surface of the Raf - C1structure ( 87 ) appear to be involved in autoinhibitory interactions in the inactive conformation of Raf ( 18 , 19 ) . At least one epitope , comprising Lys - 144 and Leu - 160 of c - Raf - 1 , overlaps with the phorbol ester - binding site on the typical C1 domains and probably has direct interactions with Ras ( 19 ) . Multi - C1 - Domain Proteins : the Contribution of Context In most of the PKCs and DAGKs , C1 domains occur in pairs . The function of individual C1 domains depends on their context in the larger protein , as illustrated by the interdependent allosteric activation of PKC by various lipids ( 93 , 119 ) . The diacylglycerol - binding sites on the C1 domains of PKC γ are obstructed in the inactive cytosolic form of the enzyme , as judged by translocation kinetics in vivo ( 94 ) . Diacylglycerol binding to the C1 domain is believed to be coupled to a large - scale conformational change that alters the interactions of the C1 domains with the kinase catalytic domains , thereby allosterically activating the enzyme ( 53 , 93 , 94 ) . PKC (cid:14) and PKD / PKC (cid:22) both contain two C1 domains , C1A and C1B . For these isozymes , the C1B contributes to phorbol ester – stimulated translocation by an A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s .

It remains to be seen whether other PKCs follow this pattern . C2 DOMAINS C2 domains are (cid:24) 120 - residue domains that were originally discovered as a con - served sequence motif in the Ca 2 + - dependent PKCs . There are now (cid:24) 600 C2 domains identiﬁed in > 400 different proteins ( see above regarding numbers taken from the SMART database ) . Much of the intense interest in these domains arises from the roles of C2 domain proteins not only in signal transduction , but also in inﬂammation , synaptic vesicle trafﬁcking and fusion , and many other cell pro - cesses ( 89 , 110 ) . Many , but not all , C2 domains bind phospholipid membranes in the presence of Ca 2 + . Some C2 domains bind membranes constitutively and do not bind Ca 2 + at all . Other C2 domains bind proteins instead of membranes , using both Ca 2 + - dependent and - independent mechanisms . Still other C2 domains bind soluble inositol polyphosphates , usually in a Ca 2 + - independent manner . Structure of the C2 Domain Structures of ﬁve different C2 domains are now known : the C2A domain of synaptotagmin I ( SytI ) ( 126 ) and the C2 domains of PKC - (cid:12) ( 126 ) and PKC - (cid:14) ( 98 ) and of phospholipases A 2 ( cPLA 2 ) ( 21 , 102 , 144 ) and C - (cid:14) 1 ( PLC (cid:14) 1 ) ( 27 , 44 ) . The structure of the C2 domain is a (cid:12) sandwich related to the immunoglobulin fold ( 45 ) . Two permutations of the C2 fold occur , known as types I ( S - type ) and II ( P - type ) , in which the sequence starts at a position in the (cid:12) sheet offset by a single strand in one as compared with the other ( Figure 3 a ) . The Ca 2 + - binding sites are formed by three loops at one tip of the structure . The loops , known as the Ca 2 + - binding regions ( CBRs ) , correspond structurally to the antigen - binding complementarity - determiningregionsofantibodyFabs . InadditiontoformingtheCa 2 + - bindingsites of the Ca 2 + - dependent class of C2 domains , the CBRs are involved in phospholipid speciﬁcity and probably in other ligand - binding interactions . −−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−− !

P1 : FRK April 18 , 2000 17 : 43 Annual Reviews AR098 - 03 ? 56 HURLEY ¥ MISRA Ca 2 + - Binding Sites Ca 2 + - binding afﬁnities are strongly dependent on the presence of phospholipid or other ligands . cPLA 2 - C2 binds two Ca 2 + in the presence or absence of membrane ( Figure 3 b ) ( 92 , 102 , 144 ) . SytI - C2A and PKC (cid:12) - C2 bind three ions , although binding to the third site is immeasurably weak in the absence of an exogenous acidic ligand ( 125 , 134 ) . PLC (cid:14) 1 - C2 binds three ions in the absence of ligands ( 28 , 46 ) . A hypothetical fourth site exists on PLC (cid:14) 1 - C2 , corresponding to the very low - afﬁnity third site on SytI , but this has not been conﬁrmed . The individual Ca 2 + sites within a C2 domain have distinct functions in binding and enzyme activation ( 7 , 83 ) . Membrane - Binding Sites There is an emerging consensus on the membrane - docking modes of Ca 2 + - depen - dent membrane - binding C2 domains ( Figure 2 b ) . The structures of the PLC (cid:14) 1 - C2 and cPLA2 - C2 are known in the context of the larger enzyme ( 21 , 27 , 44 ) . The presence of the phospholipase active sites in the same structure provides a powerful constraint on the orientation of the C2 domain with respect to the bilayer , which led to a detailed model of C2 - membrane docking ( 44 ) . The membrane - docked PLC (cid:14) 1 - C2 placed the CBR3 region closest to the membrane and juxtaposed the Ca 2 + - binding sites with the membrane surface . In this model , the concave face of the C2 structure and strand (cid:12) 3 in particular face the membrane surface across a distance of 5 – 10 ˚ A . The overall orientation is similar for cPLA 2 - C2 , but this C2 domain has a larger and more hydrophobic CBR1 than that of PLC (cid:14) 1 - C2 ( 21 , 102 , 144 ) . The inferences from structures have been conﬁrmed and elaborated on by func - tionalstudies . TrpresiduesincorporatedintotheSytI - C2AandcPLA 2 - C2domains as ﬂuorescent reporters reveal membrane penetration by SytI - C2A’s CBR1 ( 13 ) and both CBR1 and CBR3 of cPLA 2 - C2 ( 90 , 103 ) . NMR of SytI - C2A ( 12 ) and NMR and EPR studies of cPLA 2 - C2 support this picture ( 4 , 144 ) . Scanning muta - genesis and surface pressure measurements on PKC (cid:11) ( 84 ) and cPLA 2 ( 7 ) came to similar conclusions . NMR suggests that residues on the concave face of cPLA 2 - C2 sense an altered environment when bound to the membrane ( 144 ) . However , mutagenesis of the concave faces of PKC (cid:12) II - C2 ( 61 ) and cPL A 2 - C2 ( 7 ) show that this region does not contribute substantially to membrane binding even though it is oriented toward the membrane surface . Phospholipid Speciﬁcity and Subcellular Localization MostCa 2 + - dependentC2domainsbindacidicphospholipids ( 89 , 110 ) , andPLC (cid:14) 1 - C2 was most recently added to this group ( 81 ) . cPLA 2 - C2 , in contrast , seems to prefer neutral membranes , especially phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) ( 91 ) . cPLA 2 also binds phosphatidylmethanol , and it has been suggested that small head groups pro - mote binding by favoring the bilayer insertion of cPLA 2 - C2 ( 51 ) .

MEMBRANE - BINDING DOMAINS 57 in speciﬁcity correlate with the structures of the CBRs and with the ionic strength dependence of the interaction . The CBR3 of SytI and many other acidic phospho - lipid - binding C2 domains contains basic residues , whereas hydrophobic residues predominate in cPLA 2 . cPLA 2 also contains a helix in its CBR1 that inserts part of its hydrophobic surface into the membrane ( 4 , 7 , 90 , 102 , 103 , 144 ) . This helix is not present in the acidic phospholipid binders . Consistent with these ideas , SytI - C2 / membrane binding is attenuated by > 500 mM NaCl , the signature of an electrostatic interaction , whereas cPLA 2 - C2 binding is not ( 20 ) . An aromatic cluster speciﬁc to the cPLA 2 - C2 structure is predicted to form a choline head group - binding site that may explain the preference for PC over other zwitterionic lipids ( 144 ) . Subcellular localization of C2 domains correlates with their phospholipid speci - ﬁcity . PKC (cid:11) – C2 ( 16 ) and PKC γ ( 94 ) translocate to the plasma membrane , rich in the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , when free [ Ca 2 + ] increases . This is vividly illustrated by the plasma membrane translocation of PKC γ coinci - dent with Ca 2 + oscillations ( 94 ) . In contrast , increased cytoplasmic [ Ca 2 + ] induces intact cPLA 2 and cPLA 2 - C2 to translocate to the PC - rich nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum ( 43 , 103 ) . Mechanism of Ca 2 + - Dependent Membrane Binding Three mechanisms by which Ca 2 + could promote membrane binding by C2 do - mains have been widely discussed . The ﬁrst is the “Ca 2 + bridge” model . The second model invokes a conformational change in which the structure of the CBRs is altered by Ca 2 + binding such that their ability to bind membranes is increased . The third is the “electrostatic switch” mechanism . These three mechanisms are not necessarily mutually exclusive , nor do they exhaust the possibilities . The Ca 2 + Bridge Model In the Ca 2 + bridge model , Ca 2 + ions are speciﬁcally coordinated by functional groups provided by both the C2 domain and by phos - pholipids . The annexins provide a precedent ( 127 ) . The membrane - docked posi - tion of the C2 domain tip at the bilayer surface is consistent with a Ca 2 + bridge . All efforts at forming speciﬁc Ca 2 + - bridged complexes between C2 domains and short - chain phospholipids have thus far disappointed . However , a structure of a Ca 2 + - bridged complex between the cPLA 2 - C2 and the sulfonate moiety of a morpholineethanesulfonic acid buffer ion has been reported ( 21 ; Figure 3 b ) . The 10 ˚A between the putative choline site and Ca 2 + site I suggests that a single PC molecule would be unlikely to both coordinate Ca 2 + and occupy the choline pocket . The crystal structure of the PKC (cid:12) - C2 ( 125 ) reveals a Ca 2 + - bridged protein dimer that provides a different model for chelation in the putative phospholipid complex ( Figure 3 b ) . This model would position the phosphodiester (cid:24) 8 ˚A nearer to the membrane center ( or the protein 8 ˚A farther from it ) than would be suggested by the cPLA 2 - C2 [ N - morpholino ] ethanesulfonic acid complex . Arguing against a bridge mechanism , cPLA 2 - C2 is capable of Ca 2 + - dependent partitioning to pure A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l . S t r u c t . 2000 . 29 : 49 - 79 .

It appears that Ca 2 + bridging is an important contributing factor but cannot on its own serve as a general explanation for all Ca 2 + - dependent membrane binding by C2 domains . Ca 2 + Induced Conformational Changes The structure of a truncated PLC (cid:14) 1 has been determined in two different crystal forms , cubic and triclinic . In the “apo - ” formofthetricliniccrystal , CBR1isalmostcompletelyinvisibleinelectrondensity owing to disorder . Ca 2 + analog binding in the triclinic form induces a disorder - to - order conformational change in which CBR1 adopts a well - deﬁned conformation ( 44 ) . In the cubic - crystal form , CBR1 is ordered in both apo - and bound structures ( 28 ) . CBR1 in the cubic form interacts extensively with crystal packing contacts , explaining the apparent lack of a conformational change . Movement of the CBR1 in the triclinic form is much less restricted . With the exception of PLC (cid:14) 1 , all crystallized Ca 2 + - dependent C2 domains have been grown only in a single Ca 2 + ligation state . SytI - C2A was crystallized as an apodomain , but it can bind one Ca 2 + ion in the crystal ( 126 ) . Binding of additional ions shatters the SytI - C2A crystals , strongly suggesting a conformational change . Comparison of the crystal structures of closely related apo - SytI - C2A ( 126 ) and Ca 2 + - saturated PKC (cid:12) - C2 ( 125 ) reveals that the CBR1 moves 1 – 2 ˚ A and its mobility relative to the rest of the domain decreases fourfold , again consistent with an increase in order in the bound state . Taken together these data reveal a consistent pattern of Ca 2 + effects on C2 domain conformation . Fluorescence spectroscopy of the SytI ( 13 ) and cPLA 2 - C2 ( 92 ) domains indi - cates substantial Ca 2 + - induced conformational changes that extend some distance from the binding site . Chemical modiﬁcation of cPLA 2 - C2 with TID increases several - fold on Ca 2 + binding ( 20 ) , consistent with a conformational change that exposes more hydrophobic surface area , although ANS binding does not increase . NMR of SytI - C2A reveals many CBR NOEs in the bound state that decrease or disappear in the apostructure , consistent with a disorder - to - order conformational change upon Ca 2 + binding ( 116 ) . NMR of cPLA2 - C2 reveals large Ca 2 + - induced chemical - shift perturbations that are greatest for the CBRs but extend beyond them ( 144 ) . There is now overwhelming evidence that conformational changes do occur in C2 domains when they bind Ca 2 + , despite statements to the contrary ( 110 ) . It is still not clear how much these conformational changes contribute to Ca 2 + - dependent membrane binding . Electrostatic Interactions with Membranes The electrostatic switch model is based on the change in electrostatic potential at the tip of the C2 domain from negative to positive upon Ca 2 + binding ( 110 , 148 ) . The electrostatic switch model is not general because it cannot explain the neutral lipid - speciﬁc C2 domains exempliﬁed by cPLA 2 . There is no doubt that electro - static interactions are involved in the membrane binding of acidic phospholipid - speciﬁc C2 domains , because the interaction can be abolished by increasing ionic A nnu .

P1 : FRK April 18 , 2000 17 : 43 Annual Reviews AR098 - 03 ? MEMBRANE - BINDING DOMAINS 59 strength ( 20 , 148 ) . The key question is whether a nonspeciﬁc electrostatic inter - action is both necessary and sufﬁcient for binding , as opposed to a necessary role for speciﬁc interactions with Ca 2 + ions . A charge reversal mutant that increases the net charge in the CBRs of PKC (cid:12) II - C2 by + 4 severely impairs Ca 2 + - dependent binding but does not confer Ca 2 + - independent binding ( 26 ) . This result rules out the electrostatic switch model as applied to the anionic lipid - binding class of C2 domains ( 26 ) . A little discussed but potentially important model invokes a decrease in Born repulsion after Ca 2 + binding ( D Murray , B Honig & S McLaughlin , personal com - munication ) . Born repulsion is the force that keeps ions out of the low dielectric medium of membrane and protein interiors . There is a substantial Born energy penalty for bringing ions near a low dielectric medium even if they do not enter it . By nearly neutralizing the net negative charge on the tip of the C2 domain , this penalty might be reduced . No experiments speciﬁcally designed to test this idea have been reported to date . The failure of the PKC (cid:12) II - C2 charge reversal mutant ( 26 ) to bind membranes rules this mechanism out for the conventional PKC - like acidic lipid - speciﬁc C2 domains , but it has yet to be tested for cPLA 2 - C2 . In short , no single mechanism can account for all of the Ca 2 + - dependent C2 domains . Con - ventional PKCs , SytI - C2A , and many similar proteins probably rely heavily on the Ca 2 + bridge mechanism , whereas cPLA 2 may depend more on the conformational change or Born mechanisms or both . Ca 2 + - Independent C2 Domains Not all C2 domains bind Ca 2 + ions . Little is known of the function of these C2 domains . The Ca 2 + - independent C2 domains of the AplII PKC ( 101 ) and PI3K - C2 (cid:12) ( 3 ) bindphospholipidswithlowafﬁnityandlittlespeciﬁcity . Thereareenough structural data on C2 domains to predict which domains will bind and which will not . The sequences of the Ca 2 + - independent class show that most or all Ca 2 + ligands are absent . The structure of the Ca 2 + - independent PKC (cid:14) - C2 conﬁrms the expected absence of the usual acidic pocket ( 98 ) . The CBRs in the PKC (cid:14) - C2 are in sharply different conformations from those in other C2 domains . This suggests that more is required to create a Ca 2 + - independent membrane - binding site than the mere removal of the Ca 2 + - binding Asp residues . Interdomain Interactions The structures of PLC (cid:14) 1 and cPLA 2 show differing degrees of interaction between C2 and the rest of the protein . The PLC (cid:14) 1 - C2 interacts extensively with the cat - alytic and EF hand domains of the enzyme , although the CBRs are not occluded ( 27 , 44 ) . The extensive contact surfaces of the PLC (cid:14) 1 - C2 suggest that it may con - tribute to structural stabilization . In contrast , cPLA 2 - C2 has almost no interactions with the catalytic domain and can pivot through an angle of (cid:21) 10 (cid:14) ( 21 ) . Kinetics suggest that the PKC γ - C2 , like the other two , is oriented in an “outside - out” man - ner such that its CBRs are not occluded by the rest of the protein ( 94 ) . Despite the A nnu .

FYVE DOMAINS TheFYVEdomains , sofaridentiﬁedin (cid:24) 60proteins ( seeaboveregardingnumbers taken from the SMART database ) , are the mostly recently characterized addition to the family of membrane - binding modules . FYVE domains are (cid:24) 70 - to 80 - residue domains containing 8 Cys or 1 His and 7 Cys residues that coordinate two Zn 2 + atoms ( 42 , 123 , 141 ) . FYVE domains are involved in endosomal localization of proteins crucial for membrane trafﬁcking in yeast ( 141 ) and mammals ( 118 , 123 ) . The current fascination with FYVE domains was triggered by the 1998 discovery that effectors of class III phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) 3 - kinases are localized by bind - ing PI 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) via their FYVE domains ( 10 , 41 , 99 ) . FYVE domains bind PI3P but not more highly phosphorylated phosphoinositides ( 10 , 41 , 99 ) . FYVE Domain Structure , Ligand Binding , and Speciﬁcity The crystal structure of the FYVE domain from Vps27p ( 85 ) , a protein involved in endosomal maturation in yeast , reveals a compact core consisting of two small double - stranded (cid:12) sheets and a C - terminal (cid:11) - helix ( Figure 2 c ) . The structure is distantly similar to that of the C1 domain . The Zn 2 + - chelating Cys / His residues are located in pairs such that the ﬁrst and third pairs bind one zinc atom , while the second and fourth pairs bind the other zinc atom . The surface of Vps27p - FYVE contains a relatively large basic region contributed by the conserved RKHHCR motif located near and on (cid:12) 1 and by a conserved arginine from the (cid:12) 4 strand ( Figure 4 a , b ) . Mutagenesis of the RKHHCR motif results in loss of PI3P binding ( 10 ) . The sequence ( R / K ) ( R / K ) HHCR is present in all known PI3P - binding FYVE domains , although there are structurally similar domains that lack this motif ( 97 ) . The basic region is divided into two subsites consisting of the ﬁrst two and the last four residues of the RKHHCR motif . PI3P can be modeled so that its 1 - phosphate interacts with the ﬁrst two residues of the motif , while the 3 - phosphate interacts with a tight pocket formed by the last three basic motif residues and the Arg −−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−− !

In support of this model , the chemical shifts of the correspond - ing residues in early endosomal antigen - 1 ( EEA - 1 ) exhibit the largest perturbations upon titration with a water - soluble PI3P ( 71 ) . FYVE domains are speciﬁc for PI3P , showing negligible afﬁnity for PI4P , polyphosphorylated phosphoinositides , or other phospholipids ( 10 , 41 , 99 ) . Speci - ﬁcity is probably controlled by the distance between the two phosphate - binding subsites . This distance appears too short to tolerate binding of the 1 - and 4 - phos - phate groups of PI4P to their respective sites simultaneously . The 3 - phosphate binding pocket is too occluded to permit binding of polyphosphorylated phos - phoinositides such as those that bind to PH domains . EEA1 - FYVE binds to PI5P but probably too weakly to be meaningful in vivo ( 71 ) . The basic phosphate - binding residues are sufﬁciently well conserved that it seems likely most of the as - yet - uncharacterized FYVE domains will have similar ligand speciﬁcity . It is also possible that other FYVE domains could have higher afﬁnities for PI5P than EEA1 . FYVE Domain Binding to Membranes The FYVE domain binds to PI3P - containing membranes such that the tip of the N - terminal loop penetrates into the bilayer ( Figure 2 c ) . This part of Vps27p - FYVE has two successive Leu residues that form an exposed hydrophobic protrusion at one end of the domain ( 85 ) . The NMR resonances from the corresponding re - gion from EEA1 - FYVE disappear upon binding to PI3P - containing micelles ( 71 ) , suggesting that the residues penetrate the micelle . In addition , mutation of two of these residues ( Val and Thr ) eliminates endosomal localization in vivo ( 71 ) . This region contains two or more hydrophobic residues in most FYVE domains . The hydrophobic protrusion is also present in the FYVE - like Ze 2 + - binding domain of rabphilin - 3A , suggesting a function for this domain in nonspeciﬁc membrane binding . In Vps27p , several lysines not involved in PI3P binding are located at the base of the protrusion ( 85 ) . These lysines are poorly conserved and do not show main - chain chemical shift perturbations by micelles ( 71 ) , but other sequences con - tain positively charged residues that map to similar parts of the domain surface . It appears likely that the hydrophobic protrusion penetrates into membranes , whereas the basic residues at the base of the protrusion interact nonspeciﬁcally with the membrane . FYVE domain - containing proteins and FYVE domains localize to endosomal membranes containing PI3P ( 10 , 41 , 96 , 99 , 118 , 123 , 133 ) . Endosomal localiza - tion can be blocked when PI3 - kinase is inhibited with wortmannin . Although isolated FYVE domains can bind to PI3P - containing membranes , the membrane avidity of FYVE - domain containing proteins may be increased by dimerization ( 11 , 71 ) . EEA1 - FYVE has limited ability to dimerize . However , FYVE domain - GST fusions form dimers that exhibit increased binding to PI3P - containing li - posomes ( 71 ) . The full - length EEA1 protein is predicted to homodimerize by A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l . S t r u c t . 2000 . 29 : 49 - 79 .

MEMBRANE - BINDING DOMAINS 63 forming a parallel coiled coil , so that the two C - terminal EEA1 - FYVE domains are located near each other at one end of the dimer ( 11 ) . PLECKSTRIN HOMOLOGY DOMAINS PH domains have been found in > 500 cell regulatory proteins ( see above regarding numbers taken from the SMART database ) . Most PH domains bind phosphoinosi - tides , albeit with varying degrees of speciﬁcity ( 8 , 34 , 48 , 73 , 109 ) . As such , they respond directly to free phosphoinositide levels regulated by phosphoinositide kinases , phosphatases , and phospholipases . The discovery over the past 3 years that signaling through PI3 - kinases depends on PH domain - containing effectors has led to intense and renewed interest in these domains ( 34 , 72 ) . PH domains also participate in protein - protein interactions with such partners as G (cid:12)γ subunits and PKC - C1 domains ; this aspect of PH domains has been extensively reviewed elsewhere ( 8 , 73 , 109 ) . Structure of the PH Domain Structures are now known for PH domains from eight different proteins : pleckstrin ( 49 , 143 ) , spectrin ( 55 , 82 , 147 ) , dynamin ( 23 , 30 , 38 , 130 ) , PLC (cid:14) 1 ( 31 ) , son of sevenless 1 ( Sos1 ) ( 69 , 151 ) , (cid:12) - adrenergic receptor kinase ( (cid:12) Ark ) ( 39 ) , Bruton’s tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) ( 5 , 56 ) , and insulin receptor substrate 1 ( IRS - 1 ) ( 22 ) . The PH domain structure contains two orthogonal antiparallel (cid:12) sheets of three and four strands ( Figure 2 d ) . These are followed by a C - terminal (cid:11) helix . The (cid:12) sheets curve in a tight barrel - like conformation , while the C - terminal helix folds in to cover one end of the barrel . This fold is also found in the protein - binding phosphotyrosine binding ( PTB ) ( 25 , 149 , 152 ) , enabled / VASP homology ( EVH ) ( 106 ) , and Ran - binding ( RanBD ) ( 138 ) domains and as a substructure within the protein - and phospholipid - binding 4 . 1 , ezrin , radixin , and moesin ( FERM ) domain ( M Pearson , D Reczek , A Bretscher , PA Karplus , submitted for publication ) . The interstrand loops are involved in ligand binding and vary substantially in sequence and structure between PH domains . The membrane - binding face of the domain contains basic residues that assist in ligand binding . Inositol Phosphate - Binding Subsites The structures of complexes of PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH with Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( 31 ) and Btk - PH with Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 4 ( 5 ) deﬁne four different phosphate - binding subsites that par - ticipate in high - afﬁnity speciﬁc phosphoinositide binding ( Figure 5 a ) . The general outlines of the binding site are the same for PH domains of pleckstrin ( 48 , 49 ) , dynamin ( 114 , 150 ) , Sos1 ( 151 ) , and (cid:12) Ark ( 39 ) , based on NMR chemical - shift perturbations .

P1 : FRK April 18 , 2000 17 : 43 Annual Reviews AR098 - 03 ? MEMBRANE - BINDING DOMAINS 65 form most of the key interactions . In PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH , Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is buried between the 2 loops and forms 12 hydrogen bonds to 9 different amino acids of the domain . Interactions are even more extensive in Btk - PH , involving 18 hydrogen bonds . This is consistent with the higher afﬁnity of the latter for its cognate ligand , 40 nM ( 36 ) , as compared with 210 nM for PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH ( 74 ) . The 1 - and 4 - phosphates of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 bind to equivalent subsites ( denoted I and IV in Figure 5 a ) in PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH and Btk - PH . Subsite I is relatively solvent exposed and poorly deﬁned . Subsite IV is buried and makes at least three close interactions with the 4 - phosphate in both structures . Subsite IV is more positively charged in PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH compared with Btk - PH . There is one dramatic difference between the two structures ; the inositol ring of the ligand is rotated about the axis deﬁned by the 1 - and 4 - carbons of the inositol ring . Thus the 3 - phosphate of Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 4 bound to Btk - PH occupies the subsite ( III ) belonging to the 5 - phosphate of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 bound to PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH . The critical Arg - 28 of Btk participates in subsite III and is conserved in PLC (cid:14) 1 . The 5 - phosphate of Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 4 occupies a subsite ( II ) that is created by a unique loop conformation in Btk - PH . Subsite II is missing in PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH . Two modes of low - afﬁnity phosphoinositide binding have been deﬁned by the structure of the spectrin - PH - Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 complex ( 55 ) and by a secondary Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 4 - binding site in the Btk gain - of - function mutant E41K ( 5 ) . The Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 interacts with spectrin - PH via the (cid:12) 5 / (cid:12) 6 loop and the opposite side of the (cid:12) 1 / (cid:12) 2 loop from the PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH domain complex . The second Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 4 binds to the (cid:12) 3 / (cid:12) 4 loop of Btk - PH E41K close to subsite I of the high - afﬁnity binding site . The low - afﬁnity sites are more solvent exposed and involve fewer contacts than those described above . Although they do not overlap , both low - afﬁnity sites are on the membrane - binding face of the PH domain and are consistent with the overall picture of PH domain / membrane interactions inferred from other studies . Phosphoinositide Speciﬁcity PH domain binding to different phosphoinositide polyphosphates and inositol polyphosphates has been systematically examined ( 59 , 62 , 107 ) , revealing a wide range of ligand afﬁnity and speciﬁcity . Rameh et al ( 107 , 120 ) subdivide PH do - mains into four groups , which provides a useful working classiﬁcation scheme . PH domains are so divergent that sequence - based classiﬁcation may not be conclusive for every case . Even classiﬁcation based on in vitro function is complicated by the variety of soluble inositol polyphosphate - and phosphoinositide - binding assays in use . Group 1 PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - binding PH domains include those of Btk ( 36 , 68 , 107 , 114 ) , Grp1 ( 62 , 65 , 66 ) , ARF nucleotide site opening ( ARNO ) ( 137 ) , cytohesin - 1 ( 88 ) , Son - of - sevenless ( Sos ) ( 107 ) , Tiam - 1 N - terminal domain ( 107 ) , Gap1 IP4BP A nnu .

Positive charges predominate in the (cid:12) 1 / (cid:12) 2 loop in other group 1 PH domains , suggesting that the binding mode observed in Btk - PH may be general to this group . Subsite IV has fewer charged interactions with the 4 - phosphate than in group 2 , consistent with the weaker binding of group 1 PH domains to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Group 2 The members of the second group have high afﬁnities for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 2 and include PLC (cid:14) 1 ( 15 , 40 , 62 , 74 ) , (cid:12) Ark ( 62 , 104 , 107 ) , (cid:12) - spectrin ( 62 , 107 ) , RasGAP ( 62 ) , the N - terminal domain of pleckstrin ( 62 , 129 ) , DAGK (cid:14) ( 62 , 129 ) , oxysterol - binding protein ( OSBP ) ( 75 , 107 ) , IRS - 1 ( 22 ) , and others ( 62 , 107 ) . Group 2 domains do not discriminate substantially between PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in vitro ( 62 , 107 ) . Preferential binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in vivo may be more a function of the greater abundance of this lipid than discrim - ination against 3 - phosphoinositides . PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 2 with high afﬁnity compared with other acidic lipids ( 73 , 109 ) , but other group 2 PH domains are less speciﬁc . In these group 2 domains , unlike PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH , strong binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 3 may depend more on the high negative charge on this lipid than on stereospeciﬁc recognition . This is consistent with the imperfect conservation of some of the key PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH basic side chains in group 2 domains . Group 3 A third group , including Akt ( also known as PKB ) ( 32 , 33 , 59 , 60 , 62 ) and PDK1 ( 1 , 124 ) , binds PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 as well as PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . The only other reported member of this group is an expressed sequence tag ( EST ) - encoded protein of unknown function ( 62 ) . Group 3 PH domains vary somewhat in their relative afﬁnities for PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 vs PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in different reports . The (cid:12) 1 / (cid:12) 2 loops of group 3 PH domains contain fewer basic residues than many of the group 1 domains , but the structural basis for speciﬁcity still is not entirely clear , pending the structure determination of a group 3 PH domain . Group 4 and Others Group 4 members , which include dynamin and the C - terminal PH domain of TIAM - 1 , exhibit relatively low binding afﬁnity for the ligands mentioned above . The high - afﬁnity phosphate subsites are absent or in - completely formed in these PH domains . Despite the low afﬁnity of dynamin - PH monomers for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the physiological importance of this interaction for endo - cytosis is well established . The effective afﬁnity is bolstered by oligomerization of dynamin ( 67 ) . PLC (cid:12) 1 - and PLC (cid:12) 2 - PH bind nonspeciﬁcally to neutral and acidic phospholipids with low afﬁnity ( 139 ) . PLC γ - PH binds 3 - phosphoinositides , in - cluding PI3P ( 29 , 62 ) . Neither its sequence nor its binding afﬁnities conform to groups 1 or 3 , so it may represent a new group . A nnu . R e v .

MEMBRANE - BINDING DOMAINS 67 Membrane - Binding Mechanisms The positively charged face and loops of PH domains are poised to form nonspe - ciﬁc contacts with negatively charged phospholipids , in addition to the speciﬁc contacts already described ( Figure 2 d ) . The importance of nonspeciﬁc contacts is highlighted by the structure of the Btk - PH E41K gain - of - function mutant ( 5 , 77 ) . This mutation results in constitutive activation of the protein , probably owing to persistent membrane association ( 76 ) . The corresponding mutation E54K in PLC (cid:14) 1 produces a similar gain in enzyme function in vitro ( 9 ) . The mutation does not increase the afﬁnity for Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 4 molecule to the binding pocket . In the crystal , a second Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 4 molecule binds to the mutated lysine on the surface of the molecule near (cid:12) - strands 3 and 4 ; three other ( native ) lysine residues complete this second binding site . The mutation increases the positively charged surface on this face of the domain ( 5 ) , and it may enhance membrane association of the domain nonspeciﬁcally , either by generalized binding of negative membrane surface charge or by binding of phosphoinositide lipids other than PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( 136 ) at the second binding site . A loss - of - function Btk mutant , K19E , maps to the (cid:12) 1 / (cid:12) 2 loop but does not directly interact with Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 4 . This mutation does not affect speciﬁc ligand binding ( 5 ) but decreases the local positive electrostatic potential and nonspe - ciﬁc afﬁnity for the membrane surface . Scanning mutagenesis of the positively charged residues in the PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH ( 142 ) shows that some of the surface residues are critical for membrane binding even though they are located outside the bind - ing pocket . Their locations suggest that the (cid:12) 1 / (cid:12) 2 and (cid:12) 3 / (cid:12) 4 strands and loops interact substantially with the phospholipid head group region of the membrane ( Figure 2 d ) . Differences in afﬁnity for soluble inositol phosphates vs the cognate membrane - bound phosphoinositides are postulated to have important regulatory consequen - ces . PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in vesicles with micromolar afﬁnity , but binds to the cognate Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 with K d D 210 nM ( 74 ) . The high binding afﬁnity of PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH to Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 may be important in product inhibition of the enzyme ( 15 , 74 ) . Localization to Cell Membranes Stimulation of PLC causes repartitioning of green ﬂuorescent protein - PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH from the plasma membrane to the cytosol ( 35 , 50 , 122 , 135 ) concomitant with the hydrolysis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the membrane and the rise in soluble Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 concentration . The relative contribution of the two factors to translocation is still under debate . Green ﬂuorescent protein - PLC (cid:14) 1 - PH translocation has been used to visualize the coupled intracellular dynamics of Ca 2 + and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( 50 ) . OSBP - PH translocation to the Golgi depends on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and at least one other unknown factor ( 75 ) . Plasma membrane localization of PH domains that bind 3 - phosphorylated phosphoinositides has been similarly demonstrated . Examples A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l .

Wortmannin inhibition of PI3K blocks plasma membrane localization of these PH domains . Roles of PH Domains Within Larger Proteins PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding allosterically activates dynamin’s GTPase activity ( 78 ) . Since Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 also has this capability ( 114 ) , some effects of the PH domain on the rest of the protein seem to be independent of membrane binding . Dbl homology ( DH ) domain - containing proteins act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho - family GTPases . The DH domains are invariably followed by a PH domain , as for Sos and Vav proteins . A crystal structure of Sos DH - PH suggests that a putative GTPase - binding site is formed by both domains ; the interface includes the negatively charged side of the PH domain ( 121 ) . Ligand binding to the PH domain has been proposed to allosterically modulate the nucleotide exchange activity of Sos , perhaps via ligand - induced conformational changes in the (cid:12) 1 - (cid:12) 2 loop . The PH domain of Sos is not required for membrane targeting ( 14 ) . By the same token , the Rac GTP exchange factor Vav is allosterically activated by PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( 47 ) . Various appendages are required for the functioning of certain PH domains . The cytohesin PH domain is followed by a 17 - residue polybasic sequence , which is required for high - afﬁnity binding to PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( 88 ) . The Btk PH domain is followed by a small Btk motif , which binds a single Zn 2 + atom ( 56 ) and has no known role other than structural stabilization . G (cid:12)γ binds to the C - terminal helix of (cid:12) Ark - PH ( 104 ) . The solution structure of (cid:12) Ark - PH reveals that this region belongs to an extension to the C - terminal helix ( 39 ) , which protrudes past the core of the domain . The activity of the Akt kinase is allosterically regulated by its PH domain , implying contacts between the PH and other domains . Phosphorylation of Akt by PDK1 is necessary for activation ( 1 , 124 ) . In addition to localizing Akt at the membrane , the PH domain directly regulates the susceptibility of Akt to phospho - rylation . Deletion of the PH domain results in higher basal phosphorylation and activity of Akt ( 112 ) . A working model postulates that the Akt - PH participates in autoinhibitory contacts with the catalytic domain of Akt that are broken upon PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 binding . OTHER MEMBRANE - BINDING DOMAINS The intensive analysis of data from genome - sequencing projects has probably left few important signaling domains undiscovered ( 6 , 115 ) . Of domains that have been recently identiﬁed by sequence analysis , the START domain stands out as a probable lipid - binding signaling domain ( 105 ) . There are many important roles for basic and amphipathic sequences , often with covalent lipid modiﬁcations , A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l . S t r u c t . 2000 . 29 : 49 - 79 .

The catalytic domains of many enzymes involved in lipid metabolism contain membrane - interacting hydrophobic ridges and basic loops and patches that may help target them to membranes . Finally , certain SH2 and PTB domains can bind phospholipids ( 108 , 152 ) in addition to their better known peptide - binding functions . CONCLUDING REMARKS Stereospeciﬁc and Nonspeciﬁc Interactions with Membranes The unique interplay between speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc interactions with mem - branes sets the lipid - directed class of signaling domains apart from all others . In all of the membrane - binding domains , the speciﬁc ligand - binding site is ﬂanked by basic or hydrophobic side - chains , or both . This arrangement of speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc binding sites has several profound consequences . The nonspeciﬁc - interaction energy can add to the stereospeciﬁc interaction to greatly increase the net interaction energy . In practice , this can lead to (cid:20) 10 4 - fold – higher binding afﬁnities . In the cell , this translates into a potent membrane - target - ing mechanism . In other cases , the nonspeciﬁc component may be weak or even unfavorable . Some membrane - binding domains seem to have a dual life as recep - tors for mutually antagonistic membrane - bound and soluble second messengers . Nonspeciﬁc membrane interactions can , in principle , augment the stereospeci - ﬁcity of the speciﬁc component of the interaction . The nonspeciﬁc membrane interaction makes an additional point of contact to deﬁne stereospeciﬁc interac - tions . Stereospeciﬁc recognition of a chiral lipid embedded in a membrane can be achieved with only two direct contacts between the protein and the lipid , provided that the protein makes an additional contact with the membrane . The degree of exposed hydrophobic surface on the protein dictates the depth to which it can penetrate the bilayer . The locations of known speciﬁc lipid - binding sites on do - main structures closely match the expected distances of the lipid head groups as measured from the center of the bilayer . The relative positioning of the speciﬁc - and nonspeciﬁc - binding sites serves as a molecular ruler that has no counterpart among domains that recognize soluble ligands . Biological Functions for Low - Afﬁnity and Nonspeciﬁc Interactions Many of the interactions described for membrane - targeting domains are of rela - tively low afﬁnity . This complicates the problem of sorting out physiologically important interactions from artifacts . Many weak interactions are clearly impor - tant in cells and , indeed , appear to be weak “by design . ” Cooperativity can be achieved by the oligomerization of weakly interacting domains into an assem - bly that binds membranes strongly . Under physiological conditions , the stable A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l . S t r u c t . 2000 . 29 : 49 - 79 .

This arrangement allows proteins such as PKC to function as temporal coincidence detectors . Targeting vs Allosteric Regulation The current emphasis on the targeting roles of membrane - binding domains should not obscure their equally important roles in the allosteric regulation of enzymes that contain them . In an evolutionary economy , a given domain in a given protein often contributes to regulation at both levels . It is clear that many protein kinases and GTPase activating proteins are allosterically activated by engagement of their membrane - binding domains . For the best understood example , PKC , this is a multistepprocessinwhichmembranelocalizationisnecessarybutnotsufﬁcientforPKCactivation . In contrast , some GAPs can be activated when their PH domains bind soluble inositol phosphates , whereas GAP targeting requires a membrane - bound phosphoinositide . Can Domain Studies Help Read Genome Sequences ? One of the great challenges to biologists in the postgenomic era will be the pre - diction of protein function from sequence . The concept of modular domains , developed over the past 15 years or so , is one of the most powerful tools available . The sophisticated use of domain data can contribute to predicting protein function . Clearly there is not a one - to - one correspondence between domain structure and function . Not all C1 domains bind diacylglycerol , not all C2 domains bind Ca 2 + , and not all PH domains bind speciﬁcally to phosphoinositides . The attribution of such functions cannot be based solely on the presence of such a domain in a protein sequence . Fortunately , structural and functional studies have allowed sequence motifs to be discovered whereby domains can be subdivided into “ﬂavors” with common functions . These assignments may be very reliable when the sequence of interest has high identity to that of a well - characterized domain whose structure and bind - ing speciﬁcity are known . Prediction is much less reliable for highly divergent sequences . A complete understanding of the sequence / function relationships of domains would be most valuable . A key direction for the bioinformatics of protein domains will be to systematize and automate the process of classifying domains into functional subgroups and to increase its scope and reliability .
