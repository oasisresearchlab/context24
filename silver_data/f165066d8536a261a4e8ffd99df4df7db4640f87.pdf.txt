Received January 12 , 2005 ; Revised Manuscript Received August 7 , 2005 We present the design , synthesis , and biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of five functional fluorescent conjugates of kabiramide C ( KabC ) , a small molecule biomimetic of gelsolin . The tetramethylrhodamine ( TMR ) , rhodol green ( RG ) , IC5 , dapoxyl ( DAP ) , and fluorescein diester ( FDE ) conjugates of KabC bind specifically to actin at the barbed end in a 1 : 1 complex . These probes are shown to function in an indistinguishable manner to the unmodified KabC . Various modalities of the fluorescence emission of these KabC probes , including fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer , are used for the development of assays for the rapid determination of G - actin concentration in solution . The TMR - KabC and FDE - KabC probes are cell permeable and provide unique imaging information on the distribution and dynamics of actin filament within living cells . INTRODUCTION Cell protrusion is characterized by fluctuations in the concentrations and activities of , and / or interactions between , membrane receptors , Rac1 , Ca 2 + , PIP 2 , cofilin , and actin filament barbed - end capping protein s these dynamic events are usually confined to lamellipodia and are coupled to the rapid and polarized polymerization of actin filaments in the vicinity of the activated membrane receptor ( 1 - 2 ) . A major challenge in cell motility research is to develop innovative approaches and techniques that permit the study of the temporal and spatial regulation of these events within the lamellipodium . The critical concentration for the in vitro polymerization of pure G - actin is (cid:24) 100 nM , yet as much as 50 % of the (cid:24) 200 (cid:237) M concentration of actin within an eukaryotic cell exists as G - actin ( 2 ) . The large amount of unpolymerized G - actin results from the sequestering activity of monomer bind - ing proteins that include thymosin (cid:226) 4 and profilin , which reduce the free concentration of G - actin to (cid:24) 100 nM ; filament capping proteins such as tropomodulin ( pointed - end ) ( 3 ) and gelsolin , capping protein ( CP ) , and CapG ( fast growing , barbed - end ) also block actin polymerization from existing filaments ( 4 - 6 ) . However , during cell protrusion , a rise in membrane - associated PIP 2 dissoci - ates barbed - end capping proteins from these filaments and is accompanied by an explosive polarization of actin facilitated by the nucleating proteins ARP2 / 3 - WASP and formins ( 2 , 7 - 11 ) . Given the central role of the barbed - end in regulating actin filament polymerization , a better understanding of cell protrusion will require knowledge of molecular events at the barbed - end of the filament and how they are regulated within cells . These are challenging studies since the protomer at the barbed - end of an actin filament accounts for only 1 in 10 4 of actin monomers within a 10 (cid:237) M solution of pure F - actin ( average filament length of 2 . 5 (cid:237) m ) or 1 in 10 6 of all protomers in a typical cell . While certain actin - directed probes such as GFP - actin ( 12 ) and TMR - phalloidin ( 13 ) are useful in quantifying total actin and the average rate of actin filament dynamics in a cell , they do not provide specific information on molecular events at the barbed - end . Furthermore , the linkage of large , aromatic , charged fluorescent probes such as TMR - maleimide to Cys - 374 of actin can impair or inhibit polymerization ( 25 ) . We have recently shown that a family of actin - targeted trisoxazole macrolides typified by kabiramide C ( KabC ) ( 14 , 15 ) function in vitro and in living cells as small molecule biomimetics of the barbed - end capping proteins , gelsolin , and CapG ( 15 ) . Since correct regulation of the barbed - end of the actin filament is essential to many cellular processes , it is no wonder that KabC and related macrolides exhibit potent cyto - toxic effects ( 15 ) . We argue that the binding specificity of KabC - related drugs to the cleft between subdomans 1 and 3 of actin ( the barbed - end ) provides an oppor - tunity to develop a new class of optical probes that serve as an indicator of molecular events associated with actin polymerization . Here , we describe the preparation and characterization of several new fluorescent KabC probes and show that they bind to G - actin with high specificity s this interaction can be quantified using a variety of changes in the fluorescence emission of the probe ( quan - tum yield , polarization , lifetime , and Foerster resonance energy transfer ) . Finally , we show using confocal imaging * To whom correspondence should be addressed . G . M . : e - mail , GM @ physiology . wisc . edu ; tel , ( 608 ) 262 - 6309 ; fax , ( 608 ) 265 - 5512 . K .

G - Actin . G - actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle using a standard protocol developed in the principal investigator’s laboratory ( 16 ) . The purity and activity of actin was analyzed using SDS - PAGE , polym - erization assays , and a motility assay ( 17 ) . Prodan - Actin . Rabbit muscle G - actin was labeled with the thiol reactive , environmentally sensitive probe , acrylodan ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) , according to our earlier publication ( 16 ) . Briefly G - actin was dialyzed at 20 (cid:237) M against dialysis buffer ( DB , 2 mM Tris , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 0 . 2 mM ATP , pH 8 . 0 ) overnight and further treated with a 2 - fold excess of acrylodan freshly prepared to 20 mM in DMF . The reaction was left in the dark for 1 h at 20 °C and then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against DB containing 1 mM DTT ( G - buffer ) . The labeled con - jugate was polymerized for 90 min at 20 °C by adding MgCl 2 and KCl to 2 mM and 0 . 1 M , respectively , and centrifuged at 4 °C for 90 min at 100 000 g in a Beckman ultracentrifuge . The pelleted fluorescent actin conjugate was resuspended in G - buffer and dialyzed against 0 . 5 L G - buffer as described above . Prodan - labeled G - actin was recovered from the supernatant fraction following a 100 000 g spin at 4 °C . Absorption spectroscopic analysis routinely showed that the labeling ratio of Prodan / actin monomer was 1 . The emission maximum of Prodan - actin shifted during the polymerization of G - actin from 496 to 465 nm and was accompanied by an 8 - fold increase in intensity at 465 nm ( 16 ) . Prodan - actin behaved as unlabeled actin in all functional assays tested ( 16 , 19 ) . Live Cell Imaging of TMR - KabC and FDE - KabC . Live cell imaging of barbed - end dynamics using TMR - KabC and FDE - KabC was performed using a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope . NIH 3T3 cells ( a gift from Dr . Anna Huttenlocher , UW - Madison ) shown on a 24 mm acid - washed coverslip housed in a sample chamber ( 12 ) were incubated with 100 nM FDE - KabC or TMR - KabC for 10 min at 37 °C . Following exchange of the cell B Petchprayoon et al . medium , the cells were imaged using the appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths according to Choidas et al . ( 12 ) . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Design of Fluorescent KabC Probes . Previous analyses of the structural and binding properties of KabC suggested that bulky groups linked to the terminal aldehyde of the tail region of KabC would interfere with its binding to the cleft between subdomains 1 and 3 of G - actin ( 15 , 20 ) . Correspondingly , a 2 , 5 - dimethylamino - naphthalenehydrazide - linked KabC derivative was found to be inactive when tested in our cytotoxicity assay ( data not shown ) ( 15 ) . This result agrees with a finding by Wada et al . ( 21 ) who showed that biotin attached to the aldehyde group of mycalolide failed to stain actin within living cells . On the basis of our previous studies ( 15 , 20 ) , we reasoned that optical probes introduced into KabC via the 7 - hydroxyl would face the solvent and therefore not interfere with KabC binding to G - actin . After considering several different approaches for the preparation of C - 7 - directed optical probes , we elected to synthesize the key intermediate , 7 - ( 4 - aminomethyl - 1 H - 1 , 2 , 3 - triazol - 1 - yl ) - kabiramide C ( AMT - KabC ) from KabC ( 18 ) . The long linker between the C - 7 of KabC and the optical probe minimizes effects of the bulky probe on actin binding . Furthermore , the introduction of a terminal amino group on KabC allows for the facile synthesis of optical and capture group derivatives using commercially available carboxy - activated fluorescence probes that include the succinimidyl esters of tetramethylrhodamine ( TMR ) , rhodol green ( RG ) , IC5 , fluorescein diester ( FDE ) , and dapoxyl ( DAP ) . The structures of the fluorescent KabC Figure 1 . Chemical structures of the five fluorescent KabC probes studied in this work , TMR - KabC ( A ) , RG - KabC ( B ) , IC5 - KabC ( C ) , DAP - KabC ( D ) , and FDE - KabC ( E ) . Fluorescent Kabiramides Probes to Quantify Actin C probes shown in Figure 1 were determined by their exact molecular weights obtained from ESI mass spectral analyses . The interactions of the fluorescent KabC probes and G - actin were characterized using spectroscopic and binding assays as described in the following sections for each probe . Characterization of Fluorescent KabC Probes . TMR - KabC . Neither the fluorescence quantum yield nor the average emission energy of the TMR group of TMR - KabC changes upon binding to unlabeled G - actin ( Figure 2A ) . This result suggests that the molecular environment of the TMR group is similar in both the free and bound states and that the linker is sufficiently constrained by the triazole ring to prevent interactions between the polar TMR group with the protein . However , the binding of TMR - KabC to G - actin substantially increases the hy - drodynamic volume of the bound TMR - KabC compared to free TMR - KabC . This change is accurately quantified by measuring the steady - state FA ( 22 ) of free TMR - KabC and increasing amount of unlabeled G - actin ( Fig - ure 2B ) . The FA values increase linearly under the stoichiometric binding condition , and analysis of the FA data shows that TMR - KabC binds to G - actin in a 1 : 1 complex ( Figure 2B ) ( 15 ) . Further support for this conclusion is provided in a FRET study of the interaction between TMR - KabC and Prodan ( Cys - 374 ) - labeled G - actin shown in Figure 2C . Excitation of Prodan on G - actin generates a strong fluorescence centered at 496 nm that decreases significantly upon adding increasing amounts of TMR - KabC , which is caused by KabC - mediated quenching as was previously reported ( 15 ) and by FRET from Prodan to TMR - KabC , which is also seen by the sensitization of TMR fluorescence . The increase in TMR - sensitized fluorescence emission and decrease in Prodan fluorescence as a function of added TMR - KabC provide a signal to analyze the stoichiometry of the complex ; thus , the plateau region of the titration occurs at a KabC - TMR concentration of 1 mM , which is the same as that of Prodan - actin and suggests that , over the concentra - tion range studied , TMR - KabC binds stoichiometrically to G - actin in a 1 : 1 complex ( Figure 2D ) . The fact that the quantum yield of the TMR emission , and by implication the lifetime of excited state , is constant in the free and bound states was exploited in the development of a simple and quantitative FA - based assay for G - actin . Thus , the change in FA value of TMR - KabC is directly related to the fractions of the probe in a sample that exist in the free state ( r of 0 . 056 ( 0 . 002 ) and the G - actin - bound state ( r of 0 . 236 ( 0 . 002 ) according to the equation r ) F f r f + F b r b , where F f + F b ) 1 , r is the observed FA value , F f and F b are fractions of free and bound fluorescent ligand , and r f and r b are FA of free and bound fluorescent ligand , respectively . The relatively low FA value ( 0 . 236 ( 0 . 002 ) found for TMR - KabC in the G - actin complex suggests that the TMR group experi - ences a considerable degree of local motion . Furthermore , the FA value is unchanged when the TMR - KabC - G - actin complex is added at a substoichiometric level to a Figure 2 . Spectroscopic and actin - binding properties of the TMR - KabC probe .

( B ) Fluorescence anisotropy values of 1 (cid:237) M TMR - KabC in G - buffer as a function of unlabeled G - actin concentrations . Excitation wavelength was 546 nm ( ( 4 nm bandwidth ) and emission was collected over 575 - 585 nm ( ( 4 nm bandwidth ) for the four measurements of polarized emission . ( C ) Fluorescence emission spectra of 1 (cid:237) M Prodan - G - actin in G - buffer as a function of TMR - KabC concentrations : ( a ) 0 nM , ( b ) 182 nM , ( c ) 364 nM , ( d ) 545 nM , ( e ) 725 nM , ( f ) 905 nM , ( g ) 1084 nM , ( h ) 1263 nM , ( i ) 1441 nM , ( j ) 1618 nM , ( k ) 1800 nM , ( l ) 1971 nM , and ( m ) 2147 nM . Excitation wavelength was 385 nm ( ( 4 nm bandwidth ) , and emission was collected over 400 - 650 nm ( ( 4 nm bandwidth ) . ( D ) Fluorescence intensity ratio of Prodan - G - actin ( 485 nm , 1 (cid:237) M ) to TMR - KabC ( 581 nm ) as a function of TMR - KabC concentrations . The binding of TMR - KabC was monitored using the fluorescence intensity decrease in Prodan resulting from KabC - mediated quenching of Prodan fluorescence , and the donor quenching and TMR - sensitized emission due to FRET . D Petchprayoon et al . polymerizing solution of actin , where it forms TMR - KabC - capped , barbed - ends ( 15 ) . These results support our view that the TMR probe in KabC complex with both G - and F - actin is fully exposed to the solvent where it experiences considerable rotational freedom . RG - KabC . The rhodol green derivative of KabC exhibits an excitation spectrum centered at 488 nm and emission at 517 nm . The fluorescence spectrum of RG - KabC does not change upon binding to G - actin , which suggests that the molecular environments of the probe in the free and bound states are similar . The FA value of RG - KabC changes from a value of 0 . 036 ( 0 . 001 in the free state to 0 . 180 ( 0 . 003 when bound to G - actin ( Figure 3A ) . As we saw with TMR - KabC , this anisotropy value suggests that the probe exhibits considerable rotational freedom when bound to G - actin and confirms our suggestion that the short linker between the C - 7 of KabC and the probe prevents the RG group from inter - acting with the protein . The similarity of the molecular environments for the RG - KabC within G - actin and capped to the ( + ) - end of actin filaments is implied from the unchanged FA value of RG - KabC in these two preparations . The higher degree of spectral overlap between Prodan emission on G - actin and the absorption spectrum of RG - KabC results in an efficient FRET process ( Figure 3B , C ) , which can be used to determine properties of the interaction including the formation of a 1 : 1 complex . Iodide Quenching of TMR - KabC and RG - KabC . To learn more about the molecular environment of the RG and TMR groups in their G - actin complexes , we performed a potassium iodide - mediated collision quench - ing study . The IC5 probe was found to be irreversibly quenched by KI , presumably by iodination , and was not included in these studies . The quenching curves for free and bound RG - and TMR - KabC show two quenching modes with the faster rate accounting for the greater degree of quenching ( Figure 4 ) . Analysis of the rapid quenching mode was achieved by restricting the linear regression of fluorescence quenching data to 60 mM KI ( Figure 4 ) . Free KabC probes were found to exhibit collision molar quenching constants of 29 . 6 M - 1 ( R 2 of 0 . 999 ) for TMR - KabC and 22 . 5 M - 1 ( R 2 of 0 . 976 ) for RG - KabC . These corresponding values for TMR - KabC and RG - KabC bound to G - actin are 13 . 5 M - 1 ( R 2 of 0 . 929 ) and 14 . 5 M - 1 ( R 2 of 0 . 914 ) , respectively . Given a fluores - cence lifetime for both TMR - KabC and RG - KabC of 4 ns ( 17 ) , we calculate that the unbound probes are quenched at 7 . 4 (cid:2) 10 9 M - 1 s - 1 and 5 . 6 (cid:2) 10 9 M - 1 s - 1 , respectively , which are very close to the diffusion - controlled rate of 8 (cid:2) 10 9 M - 1 s - 1 ( 16 ) . Since the lifetimes of the TMR - KabC and RG - KabC probes do not change on binding to G - actin , the quenching rate constants calculated for the bound probes are very similar at 3 . 38 (cid:2) 10 9 M - 1 s - 1 and 3 . 63 (cid:2) 10 9 M - 1 s - 1 , respectively . The analysis of these quenching data supports the conclusion reached from the spectral and FA analyses showing that the TMR - KabC and RG - KabC probes are fully exposed to the solvent and experience a considerable degree of rotational freedom .

Fluorescent Kabiramides Probes to Quantify Actin E IC5 - KabC . The relative fluorescence quantum yield of IC5 - KabC increases (cid:24) 20 % upon binding to G - actin and does not involve any significant spectral shift ( Figure 5A ) . As expected , the binding of IC5 - KabC to G - actin substantially increases the hydrodynamic volume sensed by the IC5 probe compared to free IC5 - KabC . Steady - state FA measurements of IC5 - KabC increase from 0 . 155 ( 0 . 005 in the free state to 0 . 331 ( 0 . 002 when stoichiometrically bound to G - actin ( Figure 5B ) . Both the integrated fluorescence intensity of the emission spec - trum and the FA value increase linearly with increasing G - actin concentration s analysis of these data shows that IC5 - KabC binds stoichiometrically ( 1 : 1 ) to G - actin . This result was confirmed from a FRET - based analysis of Prodan - actin emission at 485 nm as a function of IC5 - KabC concentration ( Figure 5C , D ) . The FA value of IC5 - KabC in the complex ( 0 . 331 ) does not change in the presence of a large excess of the ( + ) - end binding protein , CapG ( data not shown ) , which suggest that the complex has a long complex lifetime to prevent competition binding from CapG . Since the FA value for IC5 - KabC bound to the terminal protomer at the ( + ) - end of an actin filament does not increase compared to the G - actin complex , we ascribe the small difference in the FA of the IC5 - KabC - G - actin complex ( 0 . 331 ) to the limiting an - isotropy ( 0 . 4 ) in terms of a low amplitude local motion of the IC5 - KabC within the complex . The high value of the steady - state FA measured for IC5 - KabC compared to the RG - and TMR - KabC probes on actin is expected ( a ) if the lifetime of IC5 - KabC in the G - actin complex was short compared to the RG - KabC - and TMR - KabC - bound probes or ( b ) if the longer link between the IC5 group and the C - 7 of KabC allows the IC5 probe to double - back and engage in interactions with the protein surface that restrict local motion . Since the relative quantum yield of IC5 - KabC emission is already high , then the fluorescence lifetime would if anything increase on binding to G - actin ; on the basis of this argument , it is possible to rule out the first possibil - ity . On the other hand , the emission spectrum of the IC5 probe ( 23 ) is slightly red - shifted in the G - actin complex compared to the free probe , which is evidence that the probe engages in different interactions in the G - actin complex compared to water . Taken together , we propose that the very high FA value measured for IC5 - KabC - bound G - actin results from a significant reduction in local motion of the probe that is brought about by interactions between the IC5 probe and the G - actin . DAP - KabC . Dapoxyl group has been reported to be sensitive to changes in its molecular environment , and accordingly , the relative fluorescence quantum yield of DAP - KabC decreased upon binding to G - actin ( Figure 6A ) . These data were used to confirm that the KabC probe binds to G - actin in a 1 : 1 complex . While the fluorescence of the DAP probe is severely quenched in the complex , we expect that the bound probe may prove to be sensitive to the presence of ternary protein and Figure 5 . Spectroscopic and actin - binding properties of the IC5 - KabC probe . ( A ) Fluorescence intensity of IC5 - KabC binding to G - actin . The binding of IC5 - KabC was monitored using the increase in the integrated emission intensity of IC5 - KabC ( 200 nM , in G - buffer ) upon binding to actin as a function of G - actin concentrations . ( B ) Fluorescence anisotropy values of 1 (cid:237) M IC5 - KabC in G - buffer as a function of unlabeled G - actin concentrations . Excitation wavelength was 630 nm ( ( 4 nm bandwidth ) , and emission was collected over 655 - 665 nm ( ( 4 nm bandwidth ) for the four measurements of polarized emission . ( C ) Fluorescence emission spectra of 1 (cid:237) M Prodan - G - actin in G - buffer as a function of IC5 - KabC concentrations : ( a ) 0 nM , ( b ) 80 nM , ( c ) 160 nM , ( d ) 239 nM , ( e ) 318 nM , ( f ) 397 nM , ( g ) 475 nM , ( h ) 554 nM , ( i ) 632 nM , ( j ) 709 nM , ( k ) 787 nM , ( l ) 864 nM , ( m ) 941 nM , ( n ) 1018 nM , ( o ) 1095 nM , ( p ) 1171 nM , ( q ) 1247 nM , ( r ) 1323 nM , ( s ) 1398 nM , and ( t ) 1473 nM . Excitation wavelength was 385 nm ( ( 4 nm bandwidth ) , and emission was collected over 400 - 750 nm ( ( 4 nm bandwidth ) . ( D ) Fluorescence intensity of 1 (cid:237) M Prodan - G - actin at 485 nm as a function of IC5 - KabC concentrations . The binding of IC5 - KabC is detected mainly from the decrease in Prodan fluorescence resulting from KabC - mediated quenching of Prodan fluorescence and donor quenching due to FRET to IC5 . F Petchprayoon et al . ligand interactions within G - actin or the terminal actin protomer at the ( + ) - end of the filament . FDE - KabC . The binding of the nonfluorescent FDE - KabC probe to G - actin was confirmed by monitoring of Prodan - actin / FDE - KabC emission ratio at 485 / 520 nm as a function of FDE - KabC concentrations . Excitation of the Prodan fluorophore in G - actin leads to a strong emission centered at 496 nm that decreases upon the addition of increasing amount of FDE - KabC due to KabC - mediated quenching of Prodan fluorescence and the donor quenching and FDE - sensitized emission due to FRET . Analysis of these data confirms that the FDE - KabC probe binds to G - actin in a 1 : 1 complex ( Figure 6B ) . Imaging of the Fluorescent KabC Probes in Liv - ing Cells . Having shown that all of the fluorescent KabC derivatives bind in vitro to the barbed - end of actin in a tight , long - lived , and stoichiometric complex , we next sought to use TMR - KabC and FDE - KabC as optical probes in a confocal fluorescence image microscopy to image sites within living cells that are undergoing actin filament dynamics , i . e . , uncapping of barbed - ends . The FDE - KabC optical probe has three key features that make it suitable for in vivo imaging studies : ( 1 ) the probe readily permeates the plasma membrane of living cells ; ( 2 ) the fluorescein is nonfluorescent until one or both acetate groups are hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases ; and ( 3 ) once cleaved , the FDE - KabC probe remains trapped within the cell . Cells treated with medium containing 100 nM FDE - KabC display robust fluores - cence within a few minutes . Confocal imaging of FDE - KabC within live NIH - 3T3 cells shows two categories of staining . The first is a diffuse fluorescence that associates with FDE - KabC - G - actin existing in complex with G - actin - sequestering proteins such as thymosin (cid:226) 4 ( 19 ) ; the second is a far more intense fluorescence of FDE - KabC - G - actin in actin filament and is found at the cell cortex , especially at sites of cell protrusion ( Figure 7A ) . The brilliantly fluorescent TMR - KabC also crosses the plasma membrane where it becomes trapped within the cyto - plasm . After washing cells with fresh medium , fluores - cence imaging also shows that the distribution of the entrapped probe is similar to that described for FDE - KabC ( Figure 7B ) . The red - shifted excitation and emis - sion spectra of the TMR probe together with its increased photostability generate images that are of higher contrast than FDE - KabC . SUMMARY We have previously shown that KabC acts as a functional , unregulated biomimetic of gelsolin and CapG , which bind to the ( + ) - end of the actin filament . In this study , we demonstrate the design , synthesis , and spec - troscopic , functional , and biochemical characterization of five new fluorescent derivatives of KabC . We introduced a rigid triazole linker group terminated with a primary amine to facilitate the synthesis of a diverse range of fluorescence probes using commercially available suc - cinimidyl esters . The probes were characterized by exact molecular weight obtained from ESIMS . All fluorescent KabC probes formed a high stable , 1 : 1 complex with G - actin . The fluorescent KabC probes are truly unique among the commonly used optical probes for actin ( 25 ) in that the irreversible binding can be used to titrate actin that is present in complex mixtures . The specific binding of the five fluorescent KabC probes to G - actin provides an unparalleled opportunity to study Figure 6 . Spectroscopic and actin - binding properties of DAP - and FDE - KabC probes . ( A ) Fluorescence intensity of DAP - KabC binding to G - actin . The binding of DAP - KabC ( 1 (cid:237) M , in G - buffer ) was monitored using the decrease in the integrated emission intensity of DAP - KabC upon binding to actin as a function of G - actin concentrations . ( B ) Fluorescence intensity ratio of Prodan - G - actin ( 485 nm , 1 (cid:237) M ) to FDE - KabC ( 520 nm ) as a function of FDE - KabC concentrations . The binding of FDE - KabC is monitored using the fluorescence intensity decrease in Prodan resulting from KabC - mediated quenching of Prodan fluorescence , and the donor quenching and FDE - sensitized emission due to FRET .

Fluorescent Kabiramides Probes to Quantify Actin G the structural and structural dynamic properties of actin in the critical region between subdomains 1 and 3 and to map molecular events around this critical region . The rapid rate of iodide quenching of TMR - KabC and RG - KabC fluorescence in the G - actin complex supports the conclusion of the FA and spectral data that the KabC probes experience considerable rotational freedom in the G - actin complex and are exposed to solvent molecules . On the other hand , spectroscopic characterization of the IC5 - KabC complex with G - actin shows that the longer linker in the probe allows the IC5 group to associate with the surface of actin as seen in the restriction of the rotational freedom of the probe causing the slightly red - shifted emission spectrum in the complex . The fluorescence property of each KabC probe was largely unaffected following the polymerization of G - actin to F - actin . The extremely tight molecular complex be - tween the fluorescent KabC and G - actin , together with the fact that this complex can only associate with actin filaments at the ( + ) - end in an unregulated manner , fulfills a major objective of this study , which was to design probes that can map and quantify molecular events at the ( + ) - end of the filament . The family of fluorescent , membrane permeable , unregulated ( + ) - end KabC - based capping probes described herein , as well as KabC probes based on quantum dots ( 26 ) , will provide the necessary contrast to map molecular events occurring at the ( + ) - end of actin filaments in motile cells and should be useful to advance our understanding of the regulation of actin filament dynamics in cell protrusion ( 2 , 10 , 11 ) .
