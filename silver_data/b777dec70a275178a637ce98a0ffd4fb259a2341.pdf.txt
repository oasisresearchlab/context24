The various membranes involved , though interrelated , differ in structure and function . The endomembrane system consists of seven major compartments : the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , the Golgi complex , the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) , the vacuole ( or lysosome in mammals ) , the plasma membrane ( PM ) , the prevacuolar compartment ( PVC ) , and the endosome ( Fig . 1 ) ( Sanderfoot and Raikhel , 1999 ) . The endomembrane system plays a very important role in moving materials around the cell , notably proteins and membranes with high fidelity . The movement of the cargo between different compartments is mediated primarily by coated vesicles that are detached from the donor membrane by a process commonly called “budding” and incorporated to the target membrane by docking and fusion . For every compartment , an organelle - specific mechanism exists to recruit and package a correct set of proteins and lipids into vesicles that are destined for transport to an acceptor membrane ( Lippincott - Schwartz et al . , 2000 ; Schekman and Orci , 1996 ) . The transport from the ER to either the cell surface or the vacuole is referred to as the ‘anterograde pathway’ . Some vesicles also carry proteins in the reverse direction which is called as the ‘retrograde pathway’ , is essential for the recovery of proteins that may have escaped from other endomembrane compartments and also for the recycling of the machinery involved in anterograde transport . There are two major pathways for membrane or protein exchange , namely , the Secretory pathway and the Endocytic pathway . 2 1 Introduction Fig . 1 . The Endomembrane System of Yeast Secretory pathway ( Sanderfoot and Raikhel , 1999 ) The secretory pathway is the biosynthetic path for the endomembrane system , which delivers the cargo to various compartments by anterograde pathway . This pathway was originally described in pancreatic exocrine cells ( Palade , 1975 ) . Secretion can be of two types , ‘constitutive and regulated secretion’ . In the constitutive secretion , the cargo is discharged to the cell exterior continuously and in unregulated manner . Most of the cells do it , to form the extracellular matrix and plasma membrane . But in the regulated secretion , the material to be secreted is held within secretory granules and released upon appropriate stimulation , for example , cells producing hormones , digestive enzymes and neurotransmitters ( Traub and Kornfeld , 1997 ) . The early secretory system consists of ER and the Golgi complex . Most of the proteins destined for secretion first enter at the ER . The sorting of proteins into specific vesicles are controlled by molecular markings such as signal sequences and glycosylation ( Blobel , 1980 ) . The ER - resident proteins carry a signal sequence called ‘KDEL’ , the KDEL proteins which have escaped the ER , are recycled back from the Golgi to ER by COPI vesicles ( Lippincott - Schwartz et al . , 2000 ) . On the way through the Golgi , newly synthesized glycoproteins are subjected to several post - translational modifications such as ordered remodeling of their N - linked oligosaccharide side chains and biosynthesis of O - linked glycans . The late secretory system starts at TGN , where the cellular sorting machineries and specific sorting signals in the cargo molecules are responsible for directing the cargo to the plasma membrane ( PM ) , to regulated secretory granules , or to the endosomal / lysosomal system ( Le Borgne and Hoflack , 1998 ) . In higher eukaryotes , the proteins glycosylated with mannose - 6 - phosphate are targeted to the lysosome by the mannose - 6 - phosphate receptors present in the TGN through the late endosome ( Kornfeld 1 Introduction 3 and Mellman , 1989 ) . In yeast , the Pre - vacuolar compartment ( PVC ) is the immediate target for the cargoes from the TGN though some proteins bypass the PVC and reach vacuole directly . Integral membrane proteins and secretory proteins are targeted to the plasma membrane and secreted out by exocytosis . In general , the secretory pathway links organelles together to provide a framework by which proteins undergo a series of post - translational modifications including proteolytic processing , folding and glycosylation ( Storrie et al . , 2000 ) . 1 . 1 . 1 Endocytosis The endocytic pathway moves cargo or membrane surface into cell from outside to cytoplasmic compartments ( endosomes , lysosomes etc . ) . Many critical functions of a cell are mediated by endocytic mechanisms , including the uptake of extra cellular nutrients , maintenance of cell polarity , regulation of cell - surface receptor expression and antigen presentation . Additionally , pathogens such as viruses , toxins and different micro - organisms utilize endocytic pathway to get inside the cell ( Mukherjee et al . , 1997 ) . In mammalian cells , at least five different pathways for endocytic internalization are known : the clathrin - dependent pathway , macropinocytosis , the caveolar pathway , a clathrin - and caveolin - independent pathway , and phagocytosis ( Riezman et al . , 1997 ) . The most common and best characterized endocytic pathway is receptor dependent clathrin - mediated endocytosis . The pinched off vesicles rapidly lose their coats which leave them unstable , which in turn facilitate fusion of the vesicles with the sorting or early endosomes ( EE ) , the first station of the endocytic pathway ( Kornfeld and Mellman , 1989 ; Mellman , 1996 ) . Early Endosomes are structurally seen as a network of tubules and vesicles throughout the cytoplasm , and their basic function includes the sorting of received molecules ( Mellman , 1996 ) . From the EEs the membrane - bound receptors are recycled efficiently back to the PM and the free ligands are further transported for degradation to the late endosomes ( LE ) or to the lysosomes ( Mukherjee et al . , 1997 ) . Late endosomes ( LE ) are responsible for the accumulation and concentration of the cargo after receiving it from the EEs . LEs contain hydrolytically active lysosomal hydrolases and they are considered to be a starting point for the degradative process of foreign material . Mannose 6 - Phosphate Receptors ( MPRs ) concentrate in the LEs from there , they are recycled back to the TGN 4 1 Introduction ( Mukherjee et al . , 1997 ) . Delivery of endocytosed material from the LEs to the lysosomes is thought to occur by fusion of the LEs with the lysosomes , resulting in the digestion of cargo in the lysosomes by low pH and the lysosomal enzymes ( Gruenberg and Howell , 1989 ; Mellman , 1996 ) . The resulting degradation products are transferred out from the lysosomes to cytosol , where they can be utilized by the cell or alternatively transported out of the cell ( Mellman , 1996 ) . Clathrin - independent phagocytosis ( “cell eating” ) refers to the internalization of large ( > 0 . 5 µm diameter ) particles . Micro - organisms are also internalised by phagocytosis ( Mellman , 1996 ) . In mammals , phagocytosis is seen preferentially in cells with specialized roles , such as e . g . macrophages and neutrophils ( Mukherjee et al . , 1997 ) . In contrast to phagocytosis , pinocytosis ( “cell drinking” ) mediated by clathrin - coated pits is commonly seen in eukaryotic cells . It refers to a constitutive formation of smaller vesicles ( < 0 . 2 µm ) through which extracellular fluid and macromolecules bound to plasma membrane are internalized for further processing . The best characterized type of pinocytosis is receptor - mediated endocytosis which provides a selective uptake of specific macromolecules ( Mellman , 1996 ) . 1 . 1 . 2 Autophagy and Cvt pathway Auto - phagy ( self - eating ) is an inducible , catabolic membrane transport pathway which transports bulk cytoplasm and sometimes entire organelles to the lysosome / vacuole for recycling in response to nutrient starvation or during specific physiological conditions ( Klionsky and Emr , 2000 ) . There are two major types of autophagy , viz , macroautophagy and microautophagy . The primary morphological difference between these pathways has to do with the site of sequestration and the origin of the sequestering membrane . In macroautophagy , a sequestering double membrane vesicle called ‘autophagosome’ is formed , de novo from the cytosol ( Noda et al . , 2002 ) . The outer membrane of the autophagosome fuse with the membrane of vacuole and releases the inner membrane bound ‘autophagic body’ in the lumen of the vacuole where the hydrolases digest the membrane and process the cargo . But in microautophagy , portions of cytosol or whole organelles are sequestered directly at the surface of the degradative organelle by invagination of the limiting membrane or by septation or protrusion of arm like structures and there is no intermediate transport vesicle . Cytoplasmic to vacuole targeting ( Cvt ) pathway is an alternative biosynthetic pathway to the vacuole from the cytoplasm . This process has only been demonstrated in 1 Introduction 5 Sacchromyces cerevisiae . Most of the vacuolar hydrolases in yeast , reach the vacuole by the secretory pathway except α - mannosidase and Aminopeptidase 1 ( AP1 ) which uses the Cvt pathway . Autophagy and Cvt pathways share many components in common localized to a punctuate perivacuolar site , called the pre - autophagosomal structure ( PAS ) , but they are two different distinct processes ( Fig . 2 ) . Autophagy is catabolic , nonselective and is induced under various starvation conditions whereas Cvt pathway is biosynthetic , constitutive and active under growing conditions . The kinetics of the two pathways is also different . In 1992 , studies on the transport process of Aminopeptidase I ( AP1 ) by Klinsky et . al , confirmed the existence of Cvt pathway . The 61 kDa Aminopeptidase precursor ( pApe1p ) is synthesized in the cytosol and rapid oligomerization leads to homododecameric units as the major cytosolic form of pApe1p ( Kim et al . , 1997 ) . Multiple pApe1p dodecamers unite and form a ‘Cvt complex’ which finally matures into a double - membranous ‘Cvt vesicel’ . The Cvt vesicles are targeted to the vacuole where the outer membrane fuses with the vacuole and releases inner membrane bound ‘Cvt body’ inside the lumen of vacuole . The vacuolar hydrolases degrade the inner membrane and process the 61 kDa pApe1p into 51 kDa mature Ape1p ( mApe1p ) . The maturation of pApe1p is a two step process where a 55 kDa intermediate form appears followed by a 51 kDa mApe1p by sequential action of two vacuolar proteinases PrA and PrB ( Segui - Real et al . , 1995 ) coded by PEP4 gene . Under starvation conditions , the Cvt complex containing pApe1p was found in the autophagosomes ( Baba et al . , 1997 ) which showed that Ape1p is transported by two distinct ( autophagy and Cvt ) pathways , controlled by the nutrient conditions . Tor protein and phosphoinositide lipid mediated signaling are known to regulate the switch between the Cvt pathway and autophagy ( Kamada et al . , 2000 ; Kihara et al . , 2001 ; Nice et al . , 2002 ) . The processing of pApe1p is used as the best marker to study Cvt pathway . Ape1p is recruited onto Cvt membranes and the Cvt vesicle is formed by homotypic membrane fusion which depends on the SNARE Tlg2p and Vps45p ( Abeliovich et al . , 1999 ) . For docking and fusion of Cvt vesicles with the vacuole , Vam3p ( Darsow et al . , 1997 ) and Vps18p ( Rieder and Emr , 1997 ) are thought to be required . The SNARE complex involved in the vacuolar fusion step is : Ykt6p , Nyv1p , Vti1p , Vam3p and Vamp7p along with the class C Vps protein complex also known as HOPS ( Homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting ) and a Rab family GTPase Ypt7p ( Huang and 6 1 Introduction Klionsky , 2002 ) . A protein called Ccz1p which is an interacting partner of Ypt7p is also required for the homotypic vacuolar fusion and conventional vacuolar hydrolase transport ( Kucharczyk et al . , 2000 ) . Fig . 2 . Autophagy and the Cvt pathway in yeast ( Levine and Klionsky , 2004 ) 1 . 2 The process of membrane transport The vesicle mediated transport is a multi - step process , consists of vesicle formation ( budding ) , targeting , tethering and fusion . The vesicles , with their accompanying protein cargo , are released from the donor organelle in a process called budding ( Rothman and Orci , 1996 ) . After budding , interactions of v - and t - SNARE ( SNAP receptor ) proteins on the surface of the vesicle and acceptor organelle play a role in targeting the vesicle to the appropriate organelle ( Rothman , 1994 ) . Upon fusion , vesicle cargo is delivered to the target organelle ( Fig . 3 ) . 1 . 2 . 1 Vesicle formation Vesicle formation requires interaction of many proteins . Small GTPases of ARF ( ADP - ribosylation factor ) and Sar ( Secretion - associated and Ras - related ) families in their GTP bound form , recruit coat proteins like clathrin onto the membrane . Cargo proteins are concentrated at a specialized region called coated pits on the donor membrane and packed into a nascent vesicle . Clathrin assembles into a cage like lattice on membranes , even in the absence of vesicles , which during the process of vesicle formation , polymerizes into a 1 Introduction 7 basket made out of hexagons and pentagons on vesicles . Vesicular transport within the early secretory pathway is mediated by two types of non - clathrin coated vesicles : COPI - and COPII - coated vesicles . COPII is a coat complex which forms a main structure of transport vesicles responsible for forward transport of cargo from the ER to the Golgi complex ( Barlowe et al . , 1994 ) . COPI vesicles in their turn carry cargo retrograde from the Golgi to the ER and are also involved in the intra - Golgi transport ( Letourneur et al . , 1994 ; Orci et al . , 1997 ) . Adaptor proteins are required to recruit cargo into coated vesicles . A group of cytosolic heterotetrameric adapter complexes ( AP ) is involved in the formation of clathrin coated vesicles both in the late secretory and the endocytic pathways . They recognize three distinct sorting signals , two tyrosine based signals ( NPXY and YXXØ ) and a dileucine sorting signal , for the selection of cargo into clathrin - coated vesicles . So far 4 Adaptor Proteins ( APs ) were identified in mammalian system ( Boehm and Bonifacino , 2001 ; 2002 ; Kirchhausen , 1999 ; Robinson and Bonifacino , 2001 ) . Yeast has only three adaptor complexes and lacks AP - 4 . In mammals , AP - 1 is involved in the assortment and the clathrin dependent export of lysosomal enzymes and proteins bound to Mannose - 6 - Phosphate - Receptor ( MPR ) from the TGN to the lysosomes ( Le Borgne and Hoflack , 1998 ) . Now , AP1 is thought to be involved in the anterograde and retrograde transport between the TGN and the endosome and in traffic to the cell surface ( Hinners and Tooze , 2003 ) . In yeast , AP - 1 seems to be involved in transport from the TGN to the early Endosome ( Stepp et al . , 1995 ) . The AP - 2 is localized to PM and mediates clathrin dependent endocytosis ( Schmid , 1997 ) . AP - 3 is involved in the clathrin independent transport from the TGN to the vacuole in yeast ( Robinson and Bonifacino , 2001 ) . In contrast to yeast , AP - 3 in mammals binds clathrin ( Dell ' Angelica et al . , 1998 ) and transports proteins to the lysosomes , to some specialized compartments like the melanosomes and to the platlet granules . AP - 4 also functions at the TGN and is involved in the basolateral sorting of proteins from the TGN ( Dell ' Angelica et al . , 1999 ; Simmen et al . , 2002 ) . There are three homologous monomeric clathrin adaptor proteins in yeast and in mammalian cells , GGA - 1 , - 2 , - 3 ( Golgi - localized , γ - adaptin homologue and ARF - binding ) proteins ( Boman et al . , 2000 ) . They share functional similarities with APs . They are located in TGN and are involved in export of MPRs from TGN to endosome ( Puertollano , 2001 ) . In yeast , the double deletion of GGA1 / GGA2 showed a defect in transport and 8 1 Introduction processing of Carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) ( Dell ' Angelica et al . , 2000 ; Hirst et al . , 2000 ) . In addition , GGA proteins are also required for the sorting of the pre - vacuolar syntaxin Pep12p ( Black and Pelham , 2000 ) . AP - 1 and GGA proteins co - operate in anterograde transport from the TGN to the vacuole ( Costaguta et al . , 2001 ; Hirst et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , Clathrin Coated Vesicles ( CCVs ) with selected cargo are formed . A protein called dynamin , in its GTP - bound form , assembles into a collar around the neck of deeply invaginated pits . Hydrolysis of GTP bound to dynamin drives the closing of the collar´s neck , resulting in the dissociation of dynamin and pinching off of an isolated clathrin - coated vesicle ( Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ) . Amphiphysin recuits dynamin onto the membrane ( Owen et al . , 1998 ) and endophillin helps in the final stages of vesicle budding . Synaptojanins and auxilins help in the uncoating of clathrin vesicles . COPI and COPII coats are removed after GTP hydrolysis of ARF and Sar1 respectively . 1 . Budding Transportvesicle 3 .

Molecular mechanisms of membrane trafficking 1 . 2 . 2 Vesicle tethering and docking The uncoated vesicles may reach their destination by simple diffusion ( e . g intra Golgi transport ) but for long distances , the movement can be aided by cytoskeletal fibres or by motor proteins . As soon as the vesicle reaches the target membrane , a loose connection ( physical contact ) between the vesicle and the membrane is formed , which is called as ‘Tethering’ . Two broad classes of tethering proteins are proposed . A group of ‘long coiled - coil proteins’ like , Uso1p which is important for tethering ER - derived vesicles ( Barlowe , 1997 ) , endosomal EEA1 / Vac1p protein ( Dumas et al . , 2001 ) and Golgins may be attached to membrane by one end of the coil , using the other end it searches for the 1 Introduction 9 vesicles passing by and may make a loose attachment with the membrane . Another group consists of ‘multisubunit tethering complexes’ like COG complex , the exocyst complex , GARP complex , TRAPP I and II , Class C Vps complex and Dsl 1p complex ( Whyte and Munro , 2002 ) . The small GTPase Ypt / Rab family proteins , present on the vesicle interacts with the tethering protein in a short time frame and further GTP hydrolysis dissociates the interaction ( Cao et al . , 1998 ; Lazar et al . , 1997 ; Stahl et al . , 1996 ) . Ypt / Rab proteins seem to be involved in all aspects of vesicle trafficking , localized to specific compartments and are key regulators of membrane trafficking . There are 11 Ypt proteins in yeast ( Lazar et al . , 1997 ) and around 60 different Rab proteins in mammalian cells ( Bock et al . , 2001 ) . During the tethering process , the SNARE proteins ( see chapter : 1 . 3 . 1 ) present both on the vesicle and the target membranes bind and form a firm link between the vesicle and the target membrane which is called as ‘docking’ . The time for the cognate - SNARE interaction is limited by the GTP hydrolysis rate of the Rab proteins ( Clague , 1999 ) . The interaction of tether proteins and rabs contributes to specificity . 1 . 3 Molecular mechanism of membrane fusion 1 . 3 . 1 SNARE hypothesis In vesicular transport , the very fundamental question is how the vesicles recognize the correct target membrane . The SNARE hypothesis confers a widely accepted explanation of the mechanism of specificity in vesicle targeting ( Söllner et al . , 1993 ) . SNAREs ( Soluble N - Ethylmaleimide - Sensitive factor Attachement Protein Receptors ) are a superfamily of small membrane proteins found on both transport vesicles ( v - SNARE ) and target organelles ( t - SNARE ) . The specific interactions between t - and v - SNAREs ensure that vesicles are targeted to the correct compartment and lead to membrane fusion . SNARE proteins were first implicated in membrane fusion by Rothman group in 1993 , when they identified three previously known proteins ( synaptobrevin , syntaxin and SNAP - 25 ) as SNAP - receptors from bovine brain extract which are involved in Ca 2 + mediated exocytosis of neurotransmitter at the nerve terminal ( Söllner et al . , 1993 ) . The role of SNAREs in membrane fusion was further confirmed by proteolysis of SNAREs with tetanus and botulinum toxin which blocked neurotransmission ( Jahn and Niemann , 1994 ; Montecucco and Schiavo , 1995 ) . SNARE proteins are type II integral membrane proteins of around 15 - 40 kDa in size . The original SNARE hypothesis postulates that 10 1 Introduction each target membrane contains t - SNAREs that interact with complementary v - SNAREs on the in - coming vesicle membrane , thus each fusion step would be mediated by a unique set of ( cognate ) SNAREs . This set of SNAREs would function only in one fusion step and the specificity for the interaction was offered by the intrinsic affinity of SNAREs ( Rothman , 1994 ) . But , later it has become very clear that at least some SNAREs can function in multiple trafficking steps such as the yeast proteins Sed5p which is involved in 3 different complexes by binding 7 different SNAREs ( Nichols and Pelham , 1998 ) and Vti1p interacts with four different syntaxins ( Fischer von Mollard et al . , 1997 ; Fischer von Mollard and Stevens , 1999 ; Holthuis et al . , 1998 ; Lupashin et al . , 1997 ) . These proteins can pair with more than one set of partners and thus participate in the formation of several different SNARE complexes . In 1999 , Reinhard Jahn’s group showed that non - cognate SNARE complexes can be formed in vitro and are very similar to cognate SNARE complexes with respect to biophysical properties , assembly and disassembly . This disproved one of the aspects of original SNARE hypothesis , suggesting that the specificity of membrane fusion is not due to intrinsic specificity of SNARE pairing and ( Fasshauer et al . , 1999 ) . Studies on Ykt6p or Ykt6p and Vti1p on the transport vesicle showed that they are not sufficient to ensure specificity in membrane traffic ( Dilcher et al . , 2001 ) . This would support participation of additional proteins in vesicular targeting ( Dilcher et al . , 2001 ; Fischer von Mollard et al . , 1997 ; Lazar et al . , 1997 ; Lupashin et al . , 1997 ) . SNAREs are distinguished by a functionally important , conserved stretch of approximately 60 amino acids near their membrane binding region , referred to as SNARE motif ( Terrian and White , 1997 ; Weimbs et al . , 1997 ) . Most of the SNAREs have only one SNARE motif with an N - terminal sequence followed by a C - terminal trans - membrane domain which anchors it on the membrane . SNARE motives contain sequences capable of forming α - helical coiled - coils near the C - terminus ( Chapman et al . , 1994 ; Gerst , 1997 ) . These putative coiled - coils are involved in interaction between various SNARE proteins . When the cognate sets of SNARE motives are mixed , a conformational change of the SNARE - motif from an unstructured form towards an α - helical bundle occurs spontaneously in a stoichiometric fashion which is a prerequisite for fusion ( Sutton et al . , 1998 ) . This mechanism docks vesicles to target membranes and the assembly is known as ‘SNAREpins’ ( or trans - SNARE complex ) . Some SNARE motives 1 Introduction 11 are constitutively active due to a binding of the N - terminus to the SNARE motif . Some SNAREs , for example SNAP - 25 ( Synaptosome associated protein of 25 kDa ) have two SNARE motives , without a transmembrane domain . This SNARE is attached to membrane by palmytyl residues ( by post translational modifications ) present in the cyteine rich region which separates the two SNARE motives ( Hess et al . , 1992 ) . Others have two conformation , if the SNARE - motif is competent to bind with other SNARE proteins , the conformation is called as ‘open conformation’ , if it is not able to interact , then it is named as ‘closed conformation’ . 1 . 3 . 2 Classification of SNARE proteins In S . cerevisiae , so far , 24 SNARE proteins have been identified . In mammalian cells , more than 40 SNAREs were identified . By classical classification , SNAREs are classified on the basis of their localization either on a vesicle ( v - SNARE ) or on a target membrane ( t - SNARE ) ( Söllner et al . , 1993 ) . t - SNAREs were divided into Syntaxin - and SNAP - 25 - families and Synaptobrevins / VAMPs belonged to the v - SNAREs ( Terrian and White , 1997 ; Weimbs et al . , 1997 ) . But , the main disadvantage of this classification is that based on this it would be difficult to assign a function for a SNARE ( Jahn and Sudhof , 1999 ) . Also in the case of homotypic vacuolar fusion , there is no difference between the target and vesicle membrane and a single SNARE may be present on several membranes . So , v - and t - SNARE classification is incomplete . A further classification was done on the basis of the amino acid sequence similarity between different SNARE motives . When the four SNARE proteins form the complex , the amino acid side chains interact in 16 different layers . The amino acid composition of the 0 - layer ( ionic layer ) at the centre of the SNARE complex is highly conserved with one arginine and three glutamines ( Weimbs et al . , 1998 ) . One arginine - residue ( R ) and three glutamine residues ( Qa , b , c ) form the central layer of each SNARE complex and contribute to the stability . Based on this , SNAREs were reclassified . R - SNAREs contribute Arginine to the ionic layer and Q - SNAREs contribute Glutamine to the 0 - layer . The yeast SNARE , Bet1p , is an exception for this rule which provides serine to the 0 - layer ( Fasshauer et al . , 1998 ) . Also the mouse and rat Vti1a has an aspartate residue in the 0 - layer but it was shown that aspartate can functionally replace glutamine ( Antonin et al . , 2000a ) . All t - SNAREs ( syntaxins and SNAP - 25 ) are Q - SNAREs and most of the v - SNAREs are R - SNAREs . Three families of Q - SNAREs can be distinguished due to sequence similarities . Among Q - SNAREs , the 12 1 Introduction conserved - 3 layer has either a big amino acid like phenylalanine ( Qa ) or small amino acid residues like glycine or alanine ( Qb or Qc ) . Syntaxin 1 related SNAREs are Qa - SNAREs , related to the N - terminal helix of SNAP - 25 are Qb - SNAREs and Qc - SNAREs are similar to the C - terminal helix of SNAP - 25 ( Bock et al . , 2001 ) . S . cerevisiae contains five R - SNAREs , seven Qa - SNAREs , Six Qb - SNAREs and seven Qc - SNAREs ( Pelham , 2001 ) . 1 . 3 . 3 Function of N - terminal domains of SNAREs The N - terminal domains of many SNAREs have some independently folded domains which are not conserved and highly divergent in their amino acid sequences . The N - terminal domains of Qa - SNAREs and some Qb and Qc SNAREs such as vti1b and syntaxin8 consist of a three - helix bundle whereas the R - SNAREs Sec22p and Ykt6p form a mixed α - helical / β - sheet profilin - like fold . The N - terminal domains of SNAREs belonging to syntaxins or to Qa - SNAREs can bind proteins that regulate SNARE complex formation . Some R - SNAREs or Qa - SNAREs are recruited into budding vesicles by the binding partners of their N - terminal domain . The N - terminus of Vam7p contains a Phox domain which helps in membrane attachment ( Cheever et al . , 2001 ; Lu et al . , 2002 ) . The yeast syntaxins , Sed5p and Ufe1p bind to Sly1p ( Sec1 / Munc18 family protein which organizes membrane fusion ) by a short peptide motif from the N - terminus ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2002 ) . In the same way , Munc - 18 can bind to Syntaxin 1 in the closed comformation and is a negative regulator of SNARE complex formation ( Dulubova et al . , 1999 ; Misura et al . , 2000 ) . Sec20p through its N - terminus recruits Tip20 which is required for the retrograde transport to ER ( Sweet and Pelham , 1993 ) . The N - terminal domain of neuronal syntaxin 1 and its yeast plasma membrane homologue Sso1p , consists of a three - helix bundle which interacts with its own SNARE motif and can down regulate the capability to form SNARE complexes ( Dulubova et al . , 1999 ; Munson et al . , 2000 ) . But when the N - terminal domain of Sso1p was removed , formation of the SNARE complex assembly was accelerated ( Nicholson et al . , 1998 ) . VAMP - 4 ( Vaculor associated membrane protein ) has a di - leucine motif in the cytoplasmic domain which interacts with AP - 1 at the TGN ( Peden et al . , 2001 ) . The N - terminal extension of VAMP - 4 contains a target signal for the TGN ( Zeng et al . , 2003 ) . From our lab , recently we showed that the N - terminus of vti1b interacts with the Epsin N - terminal homology domain ( ENTH - domain ) of Enthoprotin / CLINT / epsinR , and Vti1p with the ENTH - domain of Ent3p in yeast 1 Introduction 13 ( Chidambaram et al . , 2004 ) . The ENTH domain proteins are needed for the formation of CCVs . The N - term of retrograde SNARE Use1p interacts with Frq1 , which is a Ca2 + binding protein ( Burri and Lithgow , 2004 ) . It is believed that through Frq1p , Use1p might support Pik1p to dock and modify the phosophoinositide composition of membranes for retrograde transport . Syn8p , through its N - terminus interacts with Glc7p , a protein phosphatase which regulates vacuolar traffic by controlling final stages of vacuolar fusion ( Burri and Lithgow , 2004 ) . Thus , the N - terminal domains of SNAREs may serve as inhibitors of the adjacent SNARE motif and have regulatory functions . 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 Sorting sequences for SNAREs The cytosolic domain of SNAREs can assist them to target and localize to some extent . But this is not well defined . For some SNAREs , the sorting sequences seem to be located within the region of the SNARE motif , ex . Bos1p , Bet1p and Sec22 and Vamp2p ( Burri and Lithgow , 2004 ) . In some SNAREs , sorting signal is present outside of the SNARE motif ; for example , Ykt6p has a profilin - like domain proximal to the SNARE motif which is necessary and sufficient for sorting ( Hasegawa et al . , 2003 ) . In SNAP - 25 , the palmitoylated interhelical domain targets the protein to the PM ( Gonzalo et al . , 1999 ; Loranger and Linder , 2002 ) . For some SNAREs the N - terminal domain helps in the targeting and localization like Vamp4 , as mentioned in chapter 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 . 3 . 4 Crystal structure of SNARE complexes So far only two SNARE complexes have been crystallized and the best characterized one is the exocytotic SNARE complex in synapses which releases neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft . The crystal structure of this complex showed that one helix from Syntaxin1 and Synaptobrevin and two helices of SNAP - 25 assembled to a parallel four helix bundle ( Sutton et al . , 1998 ) ( Fig . 4a ) . When the SNARE motives of these SNAREs interact they form 16 layers , each layer containing four amino acids . The central 0 - layer of this complex contains an arginine from Synaptobrevin and three glutamines one from syntaxin and two from SNAP - 25 . The stabilizing interaction is mainly mediated by hydrophobic interactions . The ionic interactions are shielded from the aqueous environment by neighboring leucin - zipper - motives and the peptide - backbone , which contribute to the stability of the complex . Apart from the ionic 0 - layer , the amino acids which form the additional 15 layers in the centre of the bundle are hightly conserved . These other layers 14 1 Introduction were numbered positively towards the C - terminus and negatively towards the N - terminus ( Fig . 4b ) . An additional well characterized late endosomal SNARE - complex consists of the 4 SNAREs vti1b , Syntaxin 8 , Syntaxin 7 and Endobrevin . Crystal structures as well as functional data supported the hypothesis , that all SNARE - complexes are similar in structure , despite of limited sequence homology ( Antonin et al . , 2002b ; Antonin et al . , 2000a ) . In yeast , a SNARE - complex which is involved in exocytosis and consists of the proteins Sec9p , Snc1 / 2p and Ssp1 / 2p shows a lot of similarities to the neuronal SNARE - complex ( Gerst , 1997 ; Rice et al . , 1997 ) . Therefore it seems that some features are common for all SNARE - complexes , for example , SNARE core complexes are extremely stable , most of them are resistant to SDS denaturation , heat stable , resistant to cleavage by toxins and for proteases digestion ( Chen and Scheller , 2001 ) . In contrary to the four helix bundle model of SNARE complexes , pentameric complexes was suggested to be formed by the SNAREs involved in homotypic vaculor fusion , Vti1p , Nyv1p , Ykt6p , Vam3p and Vam7p ( Ungermann et al . , 1999 ) . However , another group has disproven this by demonstrating that Nyv1p and Ykt6p compete for the same binding site in a complex with Vam3p , Vam7p and Vti1p and can form two different quarternary complexes ( Fukuda et al . , 2000 ) . Fig . 4a . Crytal structure of synaptic SNARE complex ( Sutton et al . , 1998 ) 1 Introduction 15 Fig . 4b . Ionic layers of SNARE complexes ( Sutton et al . , 1998 ) 1 . 3 . 5 Mechanics of membrane fusion SNARE proteins are present in all intracellular compartments and mediate specific fusion reaction . A trans - SNARE complex is formed by the action of SM ( Sec1 / Munc18 ) - proteins which might link the Ypt / Rab effectors and tethering complexes to the SNARE complex ( Jahn et al . , 2003 ) . The SNARE complex formation is associated with release of energy which drives off the energy barrier and all the four SNARE proteins align on the same membrane , now it is called as cis - SNARE complex . After fusion , the SNARE complex is dissociated into individual SNARE proteins on the membranes , a step known as ‘Priming’ by the action of Sec17p and Sec18p by hydrolyzing ATP ( Novick et al . , 1981 ) or by the mammalian chaperone - like ATPase NSF in conjunction with cofactors , thus re - activating the SNAREs for another round of membrane fusion ( Hanson et al . , 1997 ) . So , the SNARE proteins are ready for the next round of fusion . According to ‘zipper’ model of membrane fusion , once the amino termini of the SNARE motifs have found each other , they may ‘zip’ from the membrane - distal amino termini towards the membrane - proximal carboxyl termini of the SNARE motifs and the formation of the stable SNARE complex overcomes the energy barrier to drive fusion of the lipid bilayers ( Hanson et al . , 1997 ; Lin and Scheller , 1997 ) . SNARE proteins may partially zipper to 16 1 Introduction transfer the vesicle into a readily releasable state leading to ‘hemi - fusion’ or ‘preassembled pore’ between both membranes . In synaptic vesicle exocytosis , Ca 2 + triggers the full zipping of the coiled - coil complex , which results in membrane fusion and release of vesicle contents . Further recruitment of NSF and α - SNAP dissociates the SNARE complex and free SNARE proteins are ready for next round of fusion . In viral protein mediated membrane fusion , coiled - coil helical bundles are the main structural component of the fusion protein , and a conformational change of the protein promotes fusion ( Jahn and Sudhof , 1999 ; Skehel and Wiley , 1998 ) . In viral fusions , a helix bundle bends and brings two membranes together , which is called as ‘jack - knife’ mechanism ( Hughson , 1997 ) . Studies on yeast homotypic vacuolar fusion , showed that membrane fusion is promoted by a proteinaceous pore ( Peters et al . , 1999 ) . It was proposed that V0 - subunits , the membrane integral sector of the H + - ATPase , is a target of calmodulin in yeast and assemble into gap - junction - like channels that connect the fusing membranes . Various SNARE ( SNAP receptor ) proteins critical to intracellular membrane fusion is believed to operate by similar mechanisms in eukaryotic organelles ( Götte and von Mollard , 1998 ; Rossi et al . , 1997 ; Rothman and Wieland , 1996 ) . Operation by a similar mechanism would imply structural similarity , regardless of a lack of sequence conservation among evolutionarily distant members of the SNARE family . This structural similarity has been observed between mammalian SNARE proteins and some yeast homologues . Structural similarity between yeast v - SNARE Vti1p and its human homologue is suggested by the recent result that the human homologue can functionally replace Vti1p in two vesicle transport pathways ( Fischer von Mollard and Stevens , 1998 ) . 1 . 4 Biosynthetic transport to the yeast vacuole At the trans - Golgi Network , the vacuolar proteins are sorted due to the presence of vacuolar sorting signals ( Bryant and Stevens , 1998 ) . Different routes have been identified from the TGN to the vacuole . They are the carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) pathway , the alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) pathway and the multivesicular body ( CPS - 1 ) pathway . Vacuolar proteins are usually synthesized as precursors , modified during the transport in different ways , processed into the mature form in the vacuole by proteinase A encoded by PEP4 and thus used as marker proteins to study the different pathways . After translocation into the ER and transport through the Golgi - complex most of the soluble 1 Introduction 17 proteins and integral membrane proteins of the yeast vacuole are transported in the biosynthetic - secretory pathway through the pre - vacuolar compartment ( late endosome ) towards the vacuole . The soluble vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) serves as a marker protein for this transport route . Therefore this pathway is also called as the CPY - pathway ( Bryant and Stevens , 1998 ; Conibear and Stevens , 1998 ) . The inactive precursor - form of CPY ( prepro - CPY ) is transported into the lumen of the ER after synthesis . After removal of the signal sequence , the proteins receive a core - glycosylation by which the 67 kDa p1CPY - form is generated . This is then transported to the Golgi - apparatus , where further oligosaccharide - modifications take place which leads to the 69 kDa p2CPY - form . In the TGN p2CPY binds the CPY - transport receptor Vps10p ( Marcusson et al . , 1994 ) . This complex is then transported in transport vesicles towards the pre - vacuolar compartment . Here the complex dissociates . p2CPY is further transported to the vacuole and Vps10p recycles back to the Golgi - apparatus ( Cereghino et al . , 1995 ; Cooper and Stevens , 1996 ; Piper et al . , 1995 ) . In the vacuole p2CPY is processed to the mature 61 kDa mCPY - form by the action of proteinase A . These different forms of CPY can be analyzed by separating them on a SDS - gel . Apart from the CPY - pathway there exists a second , direct transport pathway from the TGN to the vacuole , without the detour through the pre - vacuolar compartment . This pathway is called as ALP - pathway , the vacuolar membrane protein alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) serves as a marker protein ( Piper et al . , 1997 ) . After translocation into the ER ALP is glycosylated to the 76 kDa proform ( pALP ) , which does not change in size through out the transport within the Golgi - apparatus . It was shown that the adapter - complex AP - 3 is involved in the transport of ALP from the TGN to the vacuole . In addition pALP accumulates in AP - 3 deficient strains ( Cowles et al . , 1997a ) . In the TGN pALP is sorted into transport vesicles via interaction of its N - terminal dileucine - signal with AP - 3 . In the vacuole pALP is processed to the mature 72 kDa mALP - form . Apart from ALP , the vacuolar SNAREs Vam3p and Nyv1p are also transported via this direct pathway ( Cowles et al . , 1997b ; Reggiori et al . , 2000 ) . The specific marker of multivesicular body ( MVB ) pathway is CPS1 , a type II integral membrane protein , is synthesized as an inactive precursor ( proCPS ) that is transported through the secretory pathway to the TGN and delivered to the prevacuolar compartment ( PVC ) . In the PVC , proCPS is sorted to the forming internal vesicles of the multivesicular bodies ( MVB ) , and these vesicles are then 18 1 Introduction delivered to the vacuole where the vesicles are degraded and CPS1 proteolytic maturation yields the active mature form of CPS1 ( mCPS ) ( Cowles et al . , 1997b ) . The fourth biosynthetic pathway to the yeast vacuole is used by the soluble vacuolar hydrolase aminopeptidase I ( API ) ( Klionsky et al . , 1992 ) . This route is called as the API - pathway or the Cvt - pathway ( cytoplasm - to - vacuole - targeting ) and described in chapter 1 . 1 . 3 . 1 . 5 SNARE protein Vti1p The yeast - v - SNARE - protein Vti1p ( Vps10 - tail - interacting ) was discovered in a 2 - hybrid - screen in search for binding partners of the cytosolic domain of Vps10p ( CPY - transport receptor ) ( Fischer von Mollard et al . , 1997 ) . But a specific biochemical interaction between Vti1p and Vps10p could not be shown . The VTI1 - gene encodes a 217 - amino acid protein with a C - terminal transmembrane domain , which is followd by a luminal part of 4 amino acids . VTI1 is an essential gene and Vti1p was shown to be localized to Golgi and pre - vacuolar membrane by sub cellular fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy ( Fischer von Mollard et al . , 1997 ; Fischer von Mollard and Stevens , 1999 ) . The SNARE - motif is located next to the transmembrane domain which contains a glutamine in the 0 - layer . Therefore Vti1p belongs to the Q - SNARE - family and sequence comparisons showed that the SNARE - motif of Vti1p is related to the N - terminal helix of SNAP - 25 ( Qb - SNARE ) . Functional studies showed that Vti1p is involved in several transport steps , from Golgi to late endosomes , retrograde transport to the cis - Golgi , biosynthetic transport to the vacuole and in TGN homotypic fusion ( Fig . 5 ) . Vti1p interacts with the Syntaxin ( Qa - SNARE ) Sed5p in the retrograde transport to the cis - Golgi , ( Lupashin et al . , 1997 ) with the Qa - SNARE Pep12 in the transport from the Golgi to the prevacuole ( Fischer von Mollard et al . , 1997 ) and with the vacuolar Syntaxin Vam3p in the biosynthetic transport of CPY , ALP and API to the vacuole ( Fischer von Mollard and Stevens , 1999 ) . In addition Vti1p is involved in the homotypic vacuolar fusion by interaction with Vam3p ( Ungermann et al . , 1999 ) . It was also shown , that Vti1p interacts biochemically with the Syntaxin Tlg2p ( TGN ) ( Holthuis et al . , 1998 ) . Snc1 / 2 , Tlg2p , Tlg1p and Vti1p are involved in the homotypic TGN fusion and the retrograde transport from the early endosome to the TGN transport ( Brickner et al . , 2001 ) . The N - terminus of Vti1p interacts with ENTH domain of Ent3p which is involved in endocytosis ( Chidambaram et al . , 2004 ) . 1 Introduction 19 Fig . 5 . SNARE complexes with Vti1p 1 . 5 . 1 Vti1p homologues Vti1p - homologuous proteins were found in C . elegans , Drosophila , Arabidopsis and mammals . In Arabidopsis so far 3 Vti1 - homologues were identified ( Sanderfoot et al . , 2000 ; Zheng et al . , 1999 ) . In mammals two Vti1 - proteins exist , Vti1a ( 27 kDa ) which shares 33 % identity with Vti1p and Vti1b ( 29 kDa ) , which only shares 27 % identity ( Fischer von Mollard and Stevens , 1998 ; Lupashin et al . , 1997 ) . Mouse Vti1a and Vti1b share only 30 % amino acid identity . In addition a brain specific splice - variant of Vti1a , Vti1a - ß ( 29 kDa ) was identified , which contains an insertion of 7 amino acids ( Antonin et al . , 2000c ) . As already mentioned , mouse - , rat - and human - Vti1a contain an aspartate instead of the glutamine in the 0 - layer - position ( Antonin et al . , 2000c ) . It seems that the two mammalian and the 3 plant - homologues of Vti1p do not possess redundant functions , but that they are specialized to different transport - pathways , which is also supported by their different subcellular localization . In the indirect immunofluorescence Vti1a was localized to Golgi and TGN - structure , whereas Vti1b seems to be associated to early and late endosomes ( Kreykenbohm et al . , 2002 ) . During homotypic fusion of late endosomes , Vti1b forms a complex with the SNARE - proteins Syntaxin 7 , Syntaxin 8 and Endobrevin / Vamp - 8 of which the crystal - structure has been solved ( Antonin et al . , 2000a ; 20 1 Introduction Antonin et al . , 2000b ) . Vti1b - knock - out - mice are viable , but show phenotypic heterogeneity . The protein level of the SNARE partner Syntaxin 8 is decreased in these mice . Hepatocytes of small knock - out - mice show a decreased level of the lysosomal degradation of endocytosed material ( Atlashkin et al . , 2003 ) . The N - terminus of Vti1b interacted with ENTH domain of Epsin - R , a protein involved in transport between the TGN and the endosomes ( reference : chapter 1 . 7 ) ( Chidambaram et al . , 2004 ) and Epsin - R is an adaptor for Vti1b ( Hirst et al . , 2004 ) . Vti1a forms a SNARE - complex with VAMP - 4 , Syntaxin 6 and Syntaxin 16 , which is involved in the fusion of early endosomes and in the retrograde transport from the early endosome to the TGN ( Kreykenbohm et al . , 2002 ; Mallard et al . , 2002 ) . Vti1a - ß functions in a SNARE complex during recycling or biogenesis of synaptic vesicles but not in exocytosis ( Antonin et al . , 2000c ) . It has been shown , that human Vti1b could functionally replace the yeast - Vti1p in the transport to the cis - Golgi as well as in the transport from the Golgi to the prevacuolar compartment , but not in the ALP - pathway ( Fischer von Mollard and Stevens , 1998 ) . In activated macrophages , Vti1b and syntaxin 6 forms a novel SNARE complex which is up regulated to secrete increased level of cytokines ( Murray et al . , 2005 ) . 1 . 5 . 2 Temperature sensitive mutants of Vti1p Since VTI1 is an essential gene , temperature sensitive vti1 mutants were generated to study the function of Vti1p . Different temperature sensitive alleles of vti1 cause blocks at different stages in the secretory pathway . Via random mutagenesis of the VTI1 gene and analysis of cells , which showed an impaired growth at higher temperatures , or defects in the protein transport , 3 different temperature - sensitive ( ts ) VTI1 - mutants were identified : vti1 - 1 , vti1 - 2 and vti1 - 11 ( Fischer von Mollard et al . , 1997 ) ( Fig . 6 ) . vti1 - 1 mutants were obtained by shuttle mutagenesis with hydroxylamine treated VTI1 on a CEN - based plasmid . The other two alleles , vti1 - 2 and vti1 - 11 were generated by PCR mutagenesis . It turned out , that the mutations in all vti1 - ts - mutants affected amino acids in the SNARE - motif , especially conserved amino acids in the interaction points ( layers ) with which Vti1p forms SNARE - complexes with other SNARE - proteins . The mutants vti1 - 1 , vti1 - 2 and vti1 - 11 all show defects in CPY - transport from the Golgi to the prevacuolar compartment after temperature shift . vti1 - 11 cells display in addition a block in the retrograde transport to the cis - Golgi , which leads to an acculumation of the ER - modified p1CPY - form because of an indirect effect on the ER to Golgi transport . vti1 - 2 cells are 1 Introduction 21 defective both in CPY and ALP pathway whereas vti1 - 1 cells are defective only in CPY pathway ( Fischer von Mollard and Stevens , 1999 ) . vti1 - 1 cells show slight defects in API - transport to the vacuole , whereas this pathway is completely blocked in vti1 - 11 cells after temperature - shift . Also vti1 - 2 cells show a partial defect in API transport step . vti1 - 1 and vti1 - 2 mutants also cause a defect in homotypic vacuolar fusion in vitro ( Ungermann et al . , 1999 ) . vti1 - 1 cells grow at 37°C nearly like wild type cells , whereas vti1 - 2 and vti1 - 11 - cells exhibit a growth defect at 37°C ( Fischer von Mollard et al . , 1997 ) . Apart from these SNARE motif mutants , few N - terminal mutants of Vti1p were also obtained by random mutagenesis ( unpublished data , Fishcer von Mollard ) . vtiQ29RW79Rp is an interesting N - terminus mutant with two point mutations , replacing glutamine ( at 29 ) and tryptophan ( at 79 ) by arginine . Fig . 6 . Temperature sensitive mutants of Vti1p 1 . 6 Role of SNARE Pep12p The endosomal syntaxin , Pep12p is required for the delivery of proteins to the vacuole of the S . cerevisiae . It is a multifunctional SNARE which controls all the known membrane fusion events in pre - vacuolar endosomes ( PVC ) since the deletion of Pep12p results in the block of all the trafficking pathways to PVC ( Gerrard et al . , 2000a ) . Pep12p forms SNARE complexes with Vti1p ( Fischer von Mollard et al . , 1997 ) , Ykt6p and Syn8p . Pep12p is localized to pre - vacuolar ( late ) endosomes . Syntaxin 7 is the mammalian homolog of Pep12p ( Becherer et al . , 1996 ) . In the absence of Tlg1p , Syn8p is required for Pep12p function . But when Tlg1p is present , Syn8p can be removed without loss of Golgi vti1 - 2 CVT Vesicle CPY ALP API API or Prevacuole vti1 - 1 vti1 - 11 ? vti1 - 2 vti1 - 11 ( vti1 - 2 ) vti1 - 11 vti1 - 1 vti1 - 2 vti1 - 11 vti1 - 11 ? Vacuole 22 1 Introduction function of Pep12p ( Lewis and Pelham , 2002 ) . Pep12p localization requires clathrin and GGA coat proteins and also it contains a FSD motif which directs it to the late endosome ( Black and Pelham , 2000 ) . The TMDs from SNAREs on each membrane is needed to transfer the ‘zipping’ force to form the core complex . In the vacuole only Vti1p and Vam3p contribute the TMDs . In the PVC , Syn8p , Vti1p and Pep12p provide the TMDs . Pep12p requires its transmembrane domain ( TMD ) for its proper localization but not for its role in vesicle fusion . Overexpression of Pep12p can compensate for loss of Vam3p and vice versa which indicates that Vam3p and Pep12p are interchangeable in the endosomal as well as the vacuolar SNARE complexes . But the TMD of Pep12p is required for participation in this complex . Thus the TMD of Pep12p plays different role in the pre - vacuolar and the vacuolar SNARE complexes ( Darsow et al . , 1997 ; Gerrard et al . , 2000b ) . Vti1p uses the retrograde transport to achieve its proper steady - state localization . Loss of Pep12p may alter the localization of Vti1p but it could not be shown clearly because of the diffuse and punctuate localization of Vti1p ( Gerrard et al . , 2000a ) . 1 . 7 ENTH domain proteins Membrane recruitment of cytosolic proteins is mediated by a growing number of modular membrane targeting modules like , PH , FYVE , PX , ENTH , ANTH , BAR and FERM domains that recognize specific lipid molecules in the membrane . Epsin N - terminal homology domain ( ENTH ) is a highly conserved domain of around 140 amino acids shared by variety of proteins implicated in the regulation of endocytosis or cytoskeletal machinery in budding and fission yeast , in nematodes , rat , mouse , oat and man ( Kay et al . , 1999 ) . There is a homologous domain for ENTH domain which is called as ANTH domain ( AP180 N - terminal homology ) present in AP180 / CALM and HIP1 / HIP1R protein families . Both ANTH and ENTH domains bind PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with high specificity which is essential for endocytosis , mediated by clathrin - coated pits ( Itoh et al . , 2001 ) . ENTH proteins have binding sites for adaptor proteins , clathrin and some multidomain proteins like Eps15 . Phylogenetic analysis of ENTH domains suggested two ENTH domain families , namely the epsin family ( contains epsins 1 - 3 , Ent1p and Ent2p ) , which interacts through NPF motifs with EH domains and functions at the cell surface ; and the enthoprotin family ( contains enthoprotin / clint / EpsinR and Ent3p ) , which contains sequences for binding to GGAs and γ - adaptin and functions on internal membranes 1 Introduction 23 ( Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2004 ) . The ENTH and ANTH domain proteins in mammals and yeast are summarized in the Fig . 7 . Fig . 7 . A / ENTH domain proteins in yeast and mammals ( Legendre - Guillemin , 2004 ) 1 . 7 . 1 Ent proteins in yeast There are five Ent proteins in S . cerevisiae , from Ent1p through Ent5p . Ent1p and Ent2p were identified by a two hybrid screen in a search for interacting factors for EH domains of Pan1p ( Wendland et al . , 1999 ) . ENTH domains of Ent1p and Ent2p are 76 . 9 % identical , while their identities with the ENTH domains of Ent3p and Ent4p range from 24 to 34 % . The ENTH domain is required for the essential functions of Ent1p and Ent2p and single deletions of these two proteins did not show any phenotype but the double mutant was inviable , suggesting that Ent1p and Ent2p are redundant in function . At least one ENTH domain was required for the viability . Ent1p is localized to the cell periphery and internal compartments and both the proteins are required for endocytosis and organization of actin cytoskeleton . The ENTH domain of Ent1p interacts with phospholipids , whereas the ubiquitin - interaction motifs ( UIMs ) in the C - terminal region bind to ubiquitylated proteins at the membrane ( Wendland et al . , 1999 ) . These events promote interactions between NPF motifs in Ent1p and EH - domain proteins ( Aguilar et 24 1 Introduction al . , 2003 ) . Ent3p and Ent4p are functionally non redundant with Ent1p or Ent2p . Ent3p and Ent5p localized to TGN and early endosomes ( Duncan et al . , 2003 ) . ENTH domain of Ent5p resembles lysine - rich ANTH domain , so the ENTH domains of Ent3p and Ent5p may be functionally different and Ent5p is unlikely to promote membrane curvature . Ent3p and Ent5p interact with Gga2p and localized to clathrin coats at the TGN and endosomes . Ent5p binds with AP1 and clathrin . Ent3p and Ent5p are required together for clathrin recruitment but they differ in clathrin - binding properties . Single deletions of ENT3 and ENT5 did not lead to defects in clathrin - mediated protein transport but the double mutant caused a defect in clathrin localization , but Ent3p lacks a clathrin binding motif . All these points provide evidence for overlapping functions of ENTH and ANTH domains in clathrin assembly and CCV mediated transport in the yeast . Ent3p and Ent5p seem to be functional accessory factors for CCV formation and function at TGN / endosomes ( Duncan et al . , 2003 ) . Ent3p has been shown as a specific effector of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 localized to endosomes and is required for protein sorting into the MVB ( Friant et al . , 2003 ) . Ent5p binds PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 specifically , associates with Vps27p and together with Ent3p is required for ubiquitin - dependent protein sorting into the multivesicular body ( Eugster et al . , 2004 ) . In Schizosaccharomyces pombe , Ent1p is an essential component of endocytosis , required for actin organization and cell morphology . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 may not be needed for the proper localization of Ent1p to endocytic sites ( Sakamoto et al . , 2004 ) . 1 . 7 . 2 Epsin family proteins in mammals The best characterized among the epsin proteins is epsin 1 which consists of an ENTH domain in the N - terminus which is highly conserved in yeast , plant , frogs and human ( Kay et al . , 1999 ; Rosenthal et al . , 1999 ) and the C - terminus contains multiple short peptide motifs that mediate interaction with endocytic proteins . These short peptides are eight copies of DPW tripeptide that mediate binding to α - ear of AP - 2 ( Owen , 1999 ; Traub et al . , 1999 ) , two distinct clathrin binding motifs ( Drake and Traub , 2001 ; Hussain et al . , 1999 ; Rosenthal et al . , 1999 ) , three NPF motifs which bind to the EH domain of Eps15 and intersectin ( Chen et al . , 1998 ; Hussain et al . , 1999 ) . Epsin1 is localized to clathrin coated pits and participates in clathrin - dependent endocytosis , including endocytosis at synapses ( Chen et al . , 1998 ) . Itoh et al showed that in cultured mammalian cells , overexpression of epsin1 containing a mutation in the ENTH domain prevented epsin1 from binding to PIP2 which blocked clathrin dependent endocytosis ( Itoh et al . , 2001 ) . 1 Introduction 25 Epsin1 interacts with promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein ( PLZF ) , a transcription factor which can target epsin 1 to the nucleus ( Hyman et al . , 2000 ) . Enthoprotin was independently discovered ( Wasiak et al . , 2002 ) and referred also as Clint ( Kalthoff et al . , 2002 ) and epsinR ( Hirst et al . , 2003 ) . It contains two clathrin binding domains in its C - terminal region and binds directly to clathrin . It also binds to AP - 1 and GGA2 through its C - terminal domain at the TGN . The γ - ear ( of AP1 ) and GAE domain ( of GGA2 ) both bind to two conserved motifs in the C - term of enthoprotin ( Duncan and Payne , 2003 ; Miller et al . , 2003 ; Mills et al . , 2003 ; Wasiak et al . , 2003 ) . Enthoprotin is localized primarily to the TGN and in endosomal membranes ( Wasiak et al . , 2003 ) . Constructs of enthoprotin lacking ENTH domain concentrate on clathrin - enriched membrane fractions ( Wasiak et al . , 2002 ) thus C - terminal domain of the protein seems to contain membrane - targeting sequences . However , ENTH - domain mutants unable to bind phospholipids relocalize from the TGN to large perinuclear puncta ( Mills et al . , 2003 ) which suggested that ENTH domain contributes to the specificity of membrane localization . Enthoprotin / EpsinR specifically binds to PI4P ( Hirst et al . , 2003 ; Mills et al . , 2003 ) . EpsinR is functionally equivalent to epsin 1 in CCV budding but in a different transport step , namely in budding from the TGN / endosomes rather than from the plasma membrane ( Fig . 8 ) ( Mills et al . , 2003 ) . Drosophila epsin , Liquid facets ( Lqf ) , was shown to be important for internalization of the Delta ( D1 ) transmembrane ligand in the developing eye . Also , when Lqf was divided into two pieces , one with ENTH domain and one without ENTH , surprisingly each part retain significant ability in D1 internalization and eye patterning ( Overstreet et al . , 2003 ) . Fig . 8 . Enthoprotin interaction at the TGN ( Legendre - Guillemin , 2004 ) 26 1 Introduction 1 . 7 . 3 Membrane curvature by ENTH domain ENTH proteins are anchored to the membrane by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through ENTH domain , leaving their C - terminal region available to recruit coat components and catalyze clathrin assembly ( Kalthoff et al . , 2002 ) . Epsins are recruited to biological membranes by multiple independent interactions instead of being targeted to the membrane by the ENTH domain alone . The ENTH domain is made up of a superhelix of 8 α - helices ( Lohi et al . , 2002 ) whereas ANTH domain is extended by one or more α - helices compared to ENTH domain , which has in total nine α - helices ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) . When the ENTH domain binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the structure shifts from eight α - helices to nine , the additional helix termed as ‘helix 0’ ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) . Structurally the ENTH domain is similar to another N - terminal domain called , VHS [ Vps27p , Hrs ( hepatocyte growth - regulated tyrosine kinase substrate ) , STAM ( signal - transducing adaptor molecule ) ] domain , ( Hyman et al . , 2000 ) present in the proteins involved in membrane trafficking . The binding site for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in ENTH consists of a pocket of basic amino acids conserved in all ENTH domains ( Ford et al . , 2002 ) and that in ANTH domain consists of a cluster of lysine amino acids ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) . Though both domains bind PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , they have different modes of membrane interaction ( Stahelin et al . , 2003b ) . The ENTH domain of epsin by itself caused liposome tubulation while the ANTH domain could not do it ( Ford et al . , 2002 ) . In the monolayer analysis , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 specifically triggers the penetration of the ENTH domain but not the ANTH domain ( Stahelin et al . , 2003b ) which is similar to specific membrane penetration of FYVE domains and PX domain by PI3P ( Stahelin et al . , 2003a ; Stahelin et al . , 2002 ) . The ENTH domain lacks a well - defined ligand binding pocket , but when PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binds , it triggers the formation of the binding pocket , also aligns the hydrophobic residues toward the membrane surface and inserts the residues ( helix 0 , an amphipathic helix ) into the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane by electrostatic switch mechanism . This membrane insertion initiates the membrane deformation by pushing surrounding lipids aside , producing a more curved surface . The energy cost for this process could be obtained by increasing the surface pressure on one side of the membrane , creating an imbalance and lowering the curvation energy . If epsin is only involved in the initial budding process , dozens of epsin molecules might be enough to shift the balance to favor the curved state ( Hurley and Wendland , 2002 ) . There are two possible models for the formation of the curvature . Insertion of the ENTH domain 1 Introduction 27 could function synergistically with the clathrin assembly to drive the membrane curvature or ENTH domain itself is enough to bend the membrane with the assembled clathrin stabilizing the deformed membrane ( reviewed in : Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2004 ) . Since PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is a central player in the formation of membrane curvature , regulation of its synthesis and turnover are great importance for endocytic vesicle trafficking . Synaptojanin dephosphorylates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , converting it into PI4P which could weaken the association of ENTH proteins and other coat components with the membrane , resulting in the uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles ( Cremona , 1999 ) . 1 . 7 . 4 Functions of ENTH proteins Apart from the membrane attachment of proteins by phsopholipid binding , ENTH domain proteins stimulate clathrin assembly ( Kalthoff et al . , 2002 ; Morgan et al . , 2000 ) . In addition to recruiting coat components to membranes , ENTH proteins contribute to the formation of ordered clathrin coats . Also ENTH proteins act as cargo specific adaptors , for example , EpsinR acts as a cargo adaptor for Vti1b ( Hirst et al . , 2004 ) . Mammalian and yeast epsins carry UIMs and are likely to accumulate ubiquitylated membrane proteins ( Aguilar et al . , 2003 ; Polo et al . , 2002 ) thus act as adaptors for a wide range of ubiquitylated cargo . Epsin 1 may function as a transcriptional regulator by binding PLZF ( Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2004 ) . E / ANTH domains , isolated from various species bind tubulin and microtubules ( de Camili et al . , 2002 ; Hussain et al . , 2003 ) . So , ENTH domain proteins may link clathrin - coated membranes to microtubules . Two ANTH domain containing proteins HIP1 and HIP1R were shown to localize to clathrin coated pits , also contains a putative actin binding motif ( ILWEQ ) in the C - terminus shows evidence for the elusive link between the actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis ( Senetar et al . , 2004 ) . A / ENTH domains play multiple roles as lipid and protein binding modules . 1 . 7 . 5 ENTH domains interact with SNARE proteins To identify interacting partners for the N - terminal domain of Vti1b , a two hybrid screen was done in our lab . Interestingly , an ENTH domain containing protein , EpsinR / enthoprotin / Clint was identified as a binding partner ( Fig . 9 ( i ) a ) . To check whether this interaction was conserved in yeast also , two hybrid interactions were done with N - terminal domain of Vti1p and yeast A / ENTH domains ( Fig . 9 ( ii ) a ) . A specific interaction between ENTH domain of Ent3p and Vti1p was observed . These interactions 28 1 Introduction were confirmed further by in vitro binding assays with bacterially expressed Strep tagged ENTH domains of Ent3p / EpsinR and His - Vti1p / Vti1b ( Fig . 9 ( i ) and ( ii ) b ) . ( i ) ( ii ) Fig . 9 . Two hybrid ( a ) and in vitro binding assay ( b ) for the interaction of vti1b / EpsinR ( i ) and Vti1p / Ent3p ( ii ) 1 Introduction 29 1 . 8 Aim Project 1 : Function of the N - terminus of Vti1p The precise function of the SNARE complex , its individual components , and of its accessory proteins remains to be characterized . The extent to which SNAREs are responsible for the initial recognition and specificity of interactions between vesicles has , however , been controversial . Many questions have arisen because some SNAREs , can act at more than one transport step ( Clague , 1999 ) . Some individual SNAREs are promiscuous in their partnerships , for example the yeast v - SNARE Vti1p has been shown to pair with four of the seven yeast syntaxin related t - SNAREs . The ability of Vti1p to mediate multiple fusion steps requires additional proteins to ensure specificity in membrane traffic . In addition , the activity of Vti1p has to be tightly regulated and it has to be transported to the correct organelles . While interaction with SNAREs , requires the SNARE motif , the function of the N - terminus is poorly understood . It is proposed that the N - terminal domains of SNAREs may have some regulatory functions . So , we would like to unravel the functions of the N - terminus of Vti1p , a versatile SNARE protein which deserves intensive investigation . Using an N - terminal mutant vtiQ29RW79R , the stability , localization , function and the turn over of mutant Vti1p should be studied to get further insight . Project 2 : Characterization of Ent proteins in yeast The preliminary data from our lab showed that ENTH domain proteins EpsinR / Ent3p interacted with the N - term domain of SNARE proteins Vti1b / Vti1p . Further studies should be conducted to investigate the functional interaction between Vti1p and Ent proteins . Also , the function of Ent3p and Ent5p should be studied by generation and characterization of deletion mutants . 2 Materials and Methods 31 2 Materials and Methods 2 . 1 Materials 2 . 1 . 1 Laboratory Equipments All Glasswares Schütt , Göttingen Autoclave bags Sarstedt , Nümbrecht Autoclave type Tecnoclav 50 Tecnomara , Zürich Bottle top filters Sarstedt Inc . , Newton , USA Corex® tubes 15ml Corning Inc . , NY Cuvetts for Electroporation Invitrogen , Leek DNA - Sequencer Type 310 ABI , PE Biosystems Electroporator 1000 Stratagene , USA Eppendorf - Tabletop centrifuge 5415C Schütt , Göttingen Fluorescence microscope IX50 Olympus , Hamburg French® Pressure Cell Press , SLM - Minco® Spectronic Instruments Gene quant II , RNA / DNA calculator Pharmacia Biotech , UK Ice machine Ziegra , Isernhagen Incubators Innova 4230 and 4330 New Brunswick Scintific , Edison Intelligent Dark Box II , LAS - 1000 Fuji , Japan Phosphoimager Fujix BAS1000 Fuji , Japan Ultra turrax T8 IKA Labortechnik , Staufen Supersignal Chemiluminiscent Substrate Pierce , Illinois / USA Syringes Sarstedt , Braunschweig Tabletop Ultracentrifuge TLA - 100 . 3 Beckmann , Münich Thermocycler GeneAmp PCR system 9600 Perkin - Elmer Cetus , Norwalk Mastercycler gradient Eppendorf , Hamburg JA - 10 and JA - 20 Polypropylene tube Nalgene , München Culture flasks for bacteria Schott , Mainz Glass pipettes Schütt , Göttingen 32 2 Materials and Methods Microscope slides Menzel - Glaser Needles for syringes B .

This pre - culture was inoculated in 1 l LB media and allowed to grow at 37 °C to an OD 600 of 0 . 4 - 0 . 6 . Cells were pre - chilled on ice for 15 min and then pelleted in JA - 10 rotor at 5000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C . Pellet was washed twice with 1 l of ice cold water and centrifuged as mentioned above . Pellet was resuspended in 20 ml ice cold sterile 10 % glycerol and centrifuged in JA - 20 rotor at 6000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C . Pellet was resuspended in 2 ml ice cold , 10 % glycerol , and aliquots of 40 µl , 80 µl and 160 µl in sterile eppendorfs were stored at − 80°C . 2 . 2 . 1 . 2 Electroporation The electroporation cuvette was washed thoroughly with 70 % alcohol , followed by sterile water and chilled on ice for 5 min . The 40 µl or 80 µl aliquot of the electro competent cells was used for each transformation . 1 . 2 µl or 2 . 5 µl of DNA was added to the cells and the contents were transferred into the pre - chilled , sterile electroporation cuvette . The cuvette was placed in the electroporater and a pulse of 1800 V was given . Immediately after the pulse , SOC medium was added to the cells and were allowed to recover in sterile tubes for 30 min at 37 °C in a water bath . Then , the cells were plated on LB plates containing appropriate antibiotic and incubated overnight at 37 °C . 2 . 2 . 1 . 3 Isolation of DNA from E . coli A single E . coli colony was inoculated into 2 ml of LB medium or 2xYT medium containing appropriate antibiotic and grown overnight at 37 °C in a shaking incubator .

Cell pellet was resuspended in 100 µl Lysozyme solution and 200 µl of NaOH : : SDS was added , mixed gently by inverting the tube 3 - 4 times and incubated at RT for 5 min . To this , 150 µl of 3M NaoAc , pH 4 . 8 was added gently , mixed and incubated for 5min at RT . It was centrifuged for 10 min at 13000 rpm in a table - top eppendorf centrifuge . The supernatant 2 Materials and Methods 47 was taken in a new eppendorf cup , 150 µl of Phenol - Chloroform - Isoamylalcohol ( 25 : 24 : 1 ) was added , mixed and centrifuged for 5 min at 13000 rpm .

DNA was diluted in water and the absorbance was measured at 260 nm . Absorbance or optical density ( OD ) of 1 at 260 nm corresponds to ~ 50 μ g / ml of double stranded DNA or ~ 40 μ g / ml of single stranded DNA and RNA or ~ 20 μ g / ml of oligonucleotides . The ratio of the readings at 260 nm and 280 nm ( OD 260 / OD 280 ) provides an estimate of the purity of the nucleic acid . Pure preparations of DNA and RNA have OD 260 / OD 280 values of 1 . 8 and 2 . 0 , respectively . Any contamination with proteins or phenol would yield values less than mentioned above . 48 2 Materials and Methods 2 . 2 . 1 . 5 Cloning techniques 2 . 2 . 1 . 5 . 1 Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) PCR is a rapid and versatile in vitro method for amplifying defined target DNA fragments by DNA polymerase which occurs naturally in living organisms , where it duplicates DNA when cells divide . It is used to amplify a short , well - defined part of a DNA strand . Taq polymerase is widely used but the disadvantage is that it lacks 3’ → 5’ proof reading exonuclease activity , leading to mutations in the sequence . But polymerases such as Pwo and Pfu have proof reading mechanism , so , combinations of Taq and Pfu provide high fidelity and accurate amplification of DNA . For example 95 °C 40 sec ( Denaturation ) 50 °C 40 sec ( Anealing ) ( Temp . based on Tm of the primers ) 72 °C 1 min ( Extension ) ( Time depends on the size of the fragment .

It was centrifuged for 2 min at 13000 rpm . The aqueous phase was taken carefully and 2 . 5 volumes of 100 % ethanol were added . This was incubated for 20 min , at - 70 ° C or 10 min on dry ice or overnight at - 20 ° C . DNA was pelleted at 13000 rpm for 10 min . The pellet was washed with 70 % ethanol . The DNA pellet was dried at 37°C and was resuspended in 50 μ l TE / RNase . 2 . 2 . 1 . 5 . 4 Restriction endonuclease ( RE ) digestion of DNA Restriction enzymes cut DNA at internal phosphodiester bonds . Different types of RE exist and the most useful one is Type II restriction enzymes which cleaves at specific sequences . The activity of restriction enzyme is measured in Units ( U ) . One unit of restriction enzyme is the amount of enzyme required to completely digest 1 µg substrate DNA in 1 h . For Analytical digestion 6 , 8 μ l ddH 2 O 1 , 0 μ l 10x Enzyme buffer 1 , 0 μ l 10x BSA ( 1 mg / ml ) [ on requirement ] 0 , 1 μ l Restriction enzyme A 0 , 1 μ l Restriction enzyme B - Incubated at 37°C for one hour and 6 μ l of 1x DNA dye was added and 6 μ l was checked on agarose gel . 2 Materials and Methods 51 For Preparative digestion : 41 μ l ddH 2 O 5 μ l Plasmid - DNA ( or 25 μ l PCR product ) 6 μ l 10x Enzyme buffer 6 μ l 10x BSA ( 1 mg / ml ) 1 μ l Restriction enzyme A 1 μ l Restriction enzyme B - Incubated for 2 - 3 h at 37°C or overnight for PCR product and the enzyme was inactivated by incubating at 80°C for 20 min and loaded on a preparative agarose gel . Using QiaexII - DNA - Extraction kit , DNA was purified and ligation was set up . 2 . 2 . 1 . 5 . 5 Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA Agarose gel electrophoresis is used to clean and separate specific DNA fragments . The agarose used for analysis is inversely proportional to the size of the DNA of interest , and can be used to differentiate the circular and linear DNA also . Thus the size and purity of DNA is analyzed . 6x DNA loading buffer 0 . 15 % ( w / v ) Bromophenol blue ( seen at 400 bp in the gel ) 0 . 15 % ( w / v ) Xylenecyanol FF ( seen at 4 kb in the gel ) 40 % Sucrose in 1x TAE Agarose concentration ( % ) Resolved DNA size ( kb ) 0 . 7 12 - 0 . 8 1 . 0 10 - 0 . 5 1 . 2 6 – 0 . 4 1 . 5 3 – 0 . 2 2 . 0 2 – 0 . 05 52 2 Materials and Methods Ethidiumbromide bath Added around 20 μ l Ethidiumbromide in 200ml of 1x TAE . The required amount of Agarose was weighed , dissolved in 1x TAE by boiling and poured into the agarose gel cassette and allowed to solidify completely . The gel was immersed in 1x TAE , then the DNA marker and the sample DNA was mixed with gel loading buffer and loaded into the lanes . The gel electrophoresis was carried out at 70 V for preparative gel and at 95 V for analytical gel . When the dye reaches the front , the gel was removed from the tank and incubated in the Ethidium bromide bath for 5 - 10 min . Ethidium bromide is a fluorescent dye which contains a planar group that intercalates between the stacked bases of the DNA . Three kinds of transilluminators are used to detect DNA fragments , viz . , 254 nm , 302 nm and 365 nm . The 302 nm transilluminator is recommended for easy detection of small amounts of DNA without inducing damage , thus allowing further cloning of the purified fragments . The gel was photographed using a gel documentation system . 2 . 2 . 1 . 5 . 6 Ligation Joining linear DNA fragments together by a phosphodiester bond between the 3’ hydroxyl of one nucleotide and the 5’ phosphate of another is called ligation . T4 DNA ligase is used for this purpose which ligates the cohesive ends of the fragments . There are two types of ligation viz . , cohesive end or sticky end ligation and blunt end ligation , depending on the restriction digestion of the DNA . For the blunt end ligation and also if digestion was with single sticky end enzyme , the vector should be dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase , and the ligation mix should be incubated for overnight . For example x μ l linearised vector DNA y μ l Insert DNA [ 1 ( vector DNA ) : 10 ( insert DNA ) ] 1 , 5 μ l 10x Ligase buffer 1 , 0 μ l T4 - DNA - Ligase ( 400 U / μ l ) Made upto 15 μ l with ddH 2 O , incubated overnight at 16°C and transformed into E . coli competent cells . 2 Materials and Methods 53 2 . 2 . 1 . 6 Sequencing of the clone DNA sequencing was done by Sanger’s method using a DNA sequencer . The plasmid DNA to be sequenced was supplied with a mixture of all four nucleotides plus four ddNTPs , each labeled with a tag that fluoresces different color . For sequencing reaction , clean DNA should be used ( prepared by QIAprep - Spin - Miniprep - Kit ) .

To the PCR product 2 μ l of 3 M Sodium aceteate ( pH 5 . 2 ) and 50 μ l 95 % EtOH ( room temperature ) was added , incubated at RT for 10 min and centrifuged for 20 min at 13000 rpm . The pellet was washed with 250 μ l of 70 % ethanol for 10 min at 13000 rpm , dried and resuspended in 25 μ l of HPLC water and given for sequencing . 2 . 2 . 1 . 7 Glycerol stocks of E . coli and S . cerevisiae The Bacteria was streaked on a LB plate and the yeast strain was streaked on a YEPD plate and incubated overnight at 37°C and 30°C respectively .

The very high efficiency of homologous recombination in yeast is used to make the gene deletions and to introduce specific mutations . There are different methods to disrupt a yeast gene . The most commonly used methods are PCR based one - step gene disruption and two step gene replacement or allele replacement . One step gene disruption : This method is useful for gene deletions and to insert PCR products . PCR primers were designed such that they consist of around 40 nucleotides as a complementary sequence to the 5’ - or 3’ flanking region of the gene of interest , followed by approximately 20 nucleotides complementary to the selectable marker . Using these primers , a gene disruption cassette was amplified from a vector that consisted of a selectable marker ( URA3 , HIS3 , LYS2 , LEU2 , TRP1 and MET15 ) flanked by sequences derived from the 5’ and 3’ ends of the target gene to be detected . The PCR mix was transformed into yeast cells and initial screening was done using the selection marker . Genomic DNA was isolated from the probable clones and again PCR was done to confirm the gene disruption . Two step gene disruption : By this method all kind of mutations can be inserted into the chromosome at any location . The desired mutations with flanking sequences are cloned into a conventional plasmid that also contains a marker that can be selected both for and against URA3 . Then the plasmid was digested with a restriction enzyme that cuts once within the yeast sequences flanking the mutation and is introduced into yeast by transformation . The DNA break 58 2 Materials and Methods stimulates recombination within the flanking sequences , leading to integration of all the vector sequences and the mutated yeast sequences into the chromosome of the yeast cell . The successfully transformed cells are selected by growth in medium lacking the uracil . Some of the cells are then subjected to medium containing Uracil and 5’ - fluororatic acid ( FOA ) . The 5 - FOA is only toxic to cells expressing the URA3 gene . The 5 - FOA resistant colonies are the possible positive clones and further screening was done by looking for the desired mutant phenotype . 2 . 2 . 2 . 6 Mating and Sporulation In heterothallic yeast strains , sex is determined by the alleles of mating - type present in a given cell . The mating - type a cells mate with the cells of mating - type α and vice versa . Cells containing both mating - types , a α diploids , do not mate but they are able to undergo meiosis and sporulation . Yeast can exist stably in either haploid or diploid states . A diploid cell grows indefinitely , but under starving conditions , it undergoes meiosis forming 4 haploid spores enclosed in a structure called ascus . Mating of MAT α or MAT a MAT α and MAT a were streaked heavily on a YEPD plate , like a cross . The plate was incubated at 30°C for 14 - 16 h . Then the possible diploid cells were checked on an appropriate selection plate . If there was no selection marker , the mating was allowed only up to 4 - 6 h on a YEPD plate , the zygotes were picked up using a micro manipulator and spotted on a YEPD plate to grow further . The mating types of the zygotes were checked and the diploids were selected . Sporulation When the diploid cells are exposed to nitrogen starvation conditions , they undergo meiosis . The four meiotic products from a diploid cell are contained together as four spores in an ascus sac , commonly called as a tetrad . Using a micro manipulator , the four spores were separated and grown as haploid cells separately . Then the mating - type of each spore was tested . 2 Materials and Methods 59 Procedure The diploid strain was streaked freshly on a SD - minimal plate and was grown overnight at 30°C . Then , a heavy streak was made on a sporulation plate and incubated at 30°C for 3 - 5 days . The tetrads were analyzed and dissected using a micromanipulator . 2 . 2 . 2 . 7 Tetrad dissection From the sporulation plate , cells were scraped and resuspended in 50 μ l of 1M sorbitol with 2 . 5 μ l of 10 mg / ml zymolyase . Cells were incubated for 7 min at 30°C in a water bath when the thick cell wall surrounding the ascus was digested . 25 μ l was taken out for further incubation at 30°C for 7 min and 200 μ l of 1 M sorbitol was added to the rest and kept on ice . After the incubation , 200 μ l of 1M sorbitol was added to it and kept on ice . From each solution , 10 μ l was taken on a YEPD plate as a line in the middle . Under an optical microscope , the four spores of an ascus were isolated using a fine needle of a micro manipulator and spotted individually in a line on the YEPD plate . The plate was incubated at 30°C or at 24°C for ts - mutants , until the spores grew up to a big colony . The spores were analyzed for deletions , on the selection plates for auxotrophic genes and the mating - type was tested . For the identification of ts - mutants , the growth was examined at different temperatures . Halo test to identify the mating type The strains to be tested and the control a ( SEY6210 ) and α ( SEY6211 ) strains were patched on a YEPD plate with at least 2 cm distance between each patch and grown overnight at 30°C . The tester strains [ RC828 ( a ) and / or sst ( α ) ] were grown overnight in YEPD liquid medium till an OD 600 0 . 1 - 0 . 5 and were diluted to 0 . 01 OD / ml . 1 . 5 % sterile agar was dissolved in water by microwave and let to cool till 55°C . 1 . 5 ml of agar and 1 . 5 ml of diluted tester strains were mixed well and poured on a YEPD plate . After 20 min , the strains to be tested were replica plated onto the agar poured plate and incubated at 30°C for 1 - 2 days to get a lawn like growth of the tester strains . The growth would be inhibited by the opposing mating type which resulted in a clear halo around the patch whereas the growth was not inhibited by the same mating type . 60 2 Materials and Methods 2 . 2 . 2 . 8 Growth test and growth curve The growth patterns of wild type and mutants are compared by growth test . The yeast strains were inoculated in 8 ml of YEPD or SD - medium and grown overnight at 24°C till OD 600 0 . 2 - 1 . 0 . The plates were pre - warmed at respective temperatures . For each strain , two dilutions were prepared in sterile water viz . , 0 . 01 OD / ml and 0 . 05 OD / ml . 10 μ l from each dilution is spotted onto the pre - warmed plates using a pattern . The spots were allowed to dry and the plates were incubated at the corresponding temperatures ( usually 24°C , 30°C , 33°C and 37°C ) . The growth was scored after 24 h . For growth curves , the log phase yeast cultures were diluted to 0 . 1 OD / ml in 5 ml medium and allowed to grow at desired temperatures . Every two hours , the OD 600 was measured at least for 10 h and the growth curve was drawn . 2 . 2 . 2 . 9 APNE test for PEP4 deficient mutants This test is very fast and easy way to identify the PEP4 , which codes for vacuolar Proteinase A , deletion strains . The strains to be tested , the PEP4 - positive ( wildtype ) strain and the PEP4 - deficient strains were streaked on a YEPD or SD plate and incubated overnight at 30°C . Next day , APNE mix was prepared as follows : For 25 ml APNE - Mix 0 . 175 g Agar 17 . 5 ml ddH 2 O 5 . 0 ml 1 M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 Were taken in a 50 ml flask and boiled in the microwave and cooled down to 55°C . 20 mg of Fast Garnet GBC salt and 2 . 5 ml freshly prepared APNE solution ( 2 mg / ml in DMF ) were added to the flask , mixed well and poured onto the overnight grown YEPD plate . After few minutes , strains would develop colors . The PEP4 - deficient strain would be white in color whereas the PEP4 - positive strain ( wild type ) would be red in color . Further confirmation of PEP4 - deficient strain was done by checking the protein extract for the maturation of CPY by western blotting using anti - CPY antibodies . Since Proteinase A is needed for the processing of the p2CPY into mature CPY , only in the PEP4 - deficient strains p2CPY would be present whereas in the PEP4 - positive strain , only mCPY would be found . 2 Materials and Methods 61 2 . 2 . 2 . 10 Zymolyase sensitivity test Zymolyase is an β - 1 , 3 - Glucanse enzyme which hydrolyses the glucose residues from the cell wall of yeast cells by cleaving the β - 1 , 3 - glucosidic linkages . If there are any changes in the composition of the cell wall , the sensitivity towards zymolyase would be altered . So , this test is used to screen cell wall defective mutants . Yeast cells were grown in YEPD medium at 24°C and 2 OD of cells were pelleted in a 15 ml falcon tube at 3000rpm for 3 min and washed once with 4 ml of 10 mM Tris pH7 . 4 . The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of 10 mM Tris pH7 . 4 . Zymolyase - 20T ( Seikagaku , Tokyo , Japan ) was added to the cells to the final concentration of 5 µg / ml and incubated at 37°C with slow shaking . Every one hour the OD was measured for up to 3 h and graph was drawn by setting the initial OD to 100 % . 2 . 2 . 3 Biochemical methods 2 . 2 . 3 . 1 Preparation of protein extract from yeast cells 10 ml of yeast culture was grown overnight till an OD 600 of maximum 1 . 0 and 1 - 10 OD of cells were pelleted at 3000 rpm for 3 min . The pellet was washed with 1ml of water in an eppendorf at 6500 rpm for 30 sec . The supernatant was discarded and 50 μ l of glass beads were added to the pellet . For 1 OD of cells , 40 μ l of Thorner buffer was taken . The required volume of Thorner buffer + 5 % β - Mercaptoethanol was heated at 70°C for 5 min . 1x Protease inhibitors was added to the Thorner buffer and the appropriate volume of buffer was added to the pellet .

To the protein samples , sodium dodecyl sulphate was added to disrupt the noncovalent interactions and β - mercaptoethanol was added to reduce the disulfide bonds . Now , the SDS - protein complex has a net negative charge and moves under electric field . Thus , proteins are separated on the basis of mass from 200 kDa to 10 kDa by adjusting the pore size of the SDS gel . SDS gel comprises of a stacking gel which is present on top of the resolving gel . Two clean glass plates ( for small gel : 16 x 16 cm ; big gel : 18 x 17 . 5 ) were fixed together with a spacer of 1 mm , using clips . 1 % agarose was used to seal the sides . The required percentage of resolving gel was prepared and poured in between the glass plates . On top of resolving gel , a small amount of water was added immediately . The gel was allowed to polymerize for about 30 min . The stacking gel was poured on top of the resolving gel and a comb with 16 wells was placed in the stacking gel and left undisturbed for about 15 min . After polymerization of the stacking gel , the combs were removed and the wells were cleaned with double distilled water to wash off any unpolymerized acrylamide .

S13 fraction was then centrifuged at 50000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C in a Beckman table top centrifuge using TLA100 . 3 rotor to obtain the S200 ( cytosolic proteins ) and the P200 fraction ( membrane proteins ) . P13 and P200 fractions were resuspended in 500 μ l and 400 μ l respectively with the lysis buffer containing protease 2 Materials and Methods 75 inhibitors . For some experiments , the pellet fractions were resuspended in 70 μ l of lysis buffer . Gel : To 50 μ l fractions of H , P13 , P200 and S200 , 25 μ l of 3x Stop buffer was added and boiled for 5 min at 95°C . From each sample 30 μ l was loaded onto SDS - PAGE , for equal volume of load . For experiments in which equal amounts of protein were loaded : usually 10 μ g per well . But it varied depending on the amounts of protein present in the fractions .

The strains to be checked were streaked on a YEPD plate with a positive ( vti1 - 1 or vti1 - 2 cells ) and a negative ( wild type cells ) control and a nitrocellulose membrane was placed on the top of the cells . The plate was incubated at the semi - permissive temperature for overnight . Then the membrane was removed from the plate , washed with water to clear up the adhering cells . The membrane was processed for immuno staining using antiserum against CPY . 2 . 2 . 4 . 3 Aminopeptidase I maturation test Aminopeptidase I is a vacuolar hydrolase which is transported from the cytosol to the vacuole by the CVT pathway ( during logarithmic and early stationary phases ) and by the autophagy ( during late stationary and starvation conditions ) . The pro form of the amino peptidase I would appear if the CVT pathway or the autophagy was blocked . The cultures from the log phase , stationary phase and nitrogen starvation were prepared as follows . 76 2 Materials and Methods The strains were grown overnight at 30°C till OD 600 0 . 5 to 1 . 2 , for the log phase cells . The stationary cultures were obtained by growing the cells for nearly 24 hours at 30°C to an OD 600 above 4 . The stationary cultures were pelleted down , resuspended in the nitrogen starvation medium and again grown for 4 h at 30°C to obtain the starved cells . Protein extracts from the log phase , stationary phase and starved cells were prepared as mentioned in 2 . 2 . 3 . 1 and analyzed by western immnuo blotting to check the maturation of aminopeptidase I using antibody against aminopeptidase I . 2 . 2 . 4 . 4 Indirect Immunofluorescence 5ml of SD or YEPD medium was inoculated with cells and grown overnight at 30 °C .

Cells were harvested and resuspended in 2 ml fixative solution and incubated overnight at room temperature on the rocker . Fixed cells were harvested and suspended in 1 ml TE β for 10 min . Spheroplasts were obtained by incubating with zymolyase at 30 °C with gentle shaking . While cells were spheroplasting , slides ( 8 - well multitest slides ) were prepared . 20 μ l of 1 mg / ml poly - L - Lysine in water was added to each well and allowed to sit for 1 min .

Meik Dilcher , he identified an uncharacterized open reading frame , YGL098w which shared the characteristic features of SNARE proteins . He showed that the 245 amino acids product from the ORF is really a SNARE protein and named it Use1p ( Unconventional SNARE in the ER ) , since it was localized in the ER . USE1 is an essential gene , so , Dr . Meik Dilcher created ts mutants by random mutagenesis to analyze its function . A 10 amino acid mutant allele ( use1 - 10AA ) , which contained 5 amino acid replacements in the SNARE motif , including the mutation D183G in the 0 layer grew more slowly at 24°C than WT cells and did not grow at 30 and 37°C . To determine the importance of the 0 layer , the allele use1 - 0 layer with the mutation D183G was created which didn’t show any growth defect . He showed that use1 mutants were defective in the retrograde traffic to the ER and co - immunoprecipitation of Use1p revealed that it formed a SNARE complex with Ufe1p , Sec20p and Sec22p . When the manuscript was submitted for publication , the reviewers asked for some more experiments . A small part of Use1p project was continued by me , by checking the vacuolar morphology of use1 mutants with FM4 - 64 staining and repeating Kar2p / BiP secretion assays in use1 mutants to support the finding that Use1p is involved in the retrograde trafficking . 3 . 1 . 1 Vacuolar morphology of use1 mutants The use1 - 10AA cells were larger , accumulated ER membranes and nuclei appeared fragmented in some cells . The morphology of vacuoles was studied by FM4 - 64 staining . Cells grown at 24°C were shifted to 30 or 37°C for 15 min and incubated with FM4 - 64 for an additional 15 min at the same temperature to stain vacuolar membranes . Vacuoles had wild - type morphology in most use1 mutant cells , but were slightly more fragmented in some use1 - 10AA cells as showed in the Fig . 10 . 80 3 Results Fig . 10 . Vacuolar morphology in use1 mutants : WT , use1 - 0 layer and use1 - 10AA cells were incubated with FM4 - 64 at 37°C or 30°C to stain the vacuoles . 3 . 1 . 2 Kar2p / BiP secretion in the use1 mutants Kar2p / Bip is a soluble ER protein , which is retrieved from the Golgi ( Semenza et al . , 1990 ) . Kar2p is secreted into the medium if retrograde traffic to the ER is blocked . It is a specific assay to check the block in the retrograde traffic . The amount of Kar2p secreted by use1 mutants was determined in a period of 2 h at permissive and restrictive temperatures . use1 - 10AA cells secreted some Kar2p at 24°C and slightly larger amounts at 30°C . A shift to 37°C increased Kar2p secretion from use1 - 0 layer cells to levels clearly above that from wild - type cells . use1 - 0 layer cells secreted less Kar2p at non - permissive temperature than use1 - 10AA cells . sec20 - 1 cells were used for comparison since this defect primarily affects the retrograde traffic to the ER ( Fig . 11 ) . Wild - type cells secreted 0 . 37 % ( SD 0 . 2 ) , sec20 - 1 cells 3 . 7 % ( SD 0 . 9 ) and use1 - 10AA cells 4 . 9 % ( SD 3 . 4 ) of the intracellular Kar2p within 2 h at 30°C in four independent experiments ; use1 - 0 layer cells secreted 0 . 8 % in 2 h at 37°C . 3 Results 81 Fig . 11 . Kar2p / BiP secretion in use1 mutants : Protein extracts from the cell pellet ( I ) and the TCA precipitated medium ( E ) were prepared from the WT , use1 - 10AA , use1 - 0 layer and sec20 - 1 cells at 24°C or 30°C or 37°C . Kar2p was detected by western immunoblotting using antibody against Kar2p / BiP . Load : Equivalents of 0 . 19 OD for the pellet fractions and 3 . 6 OD for the external fractions were subjected to SDS PAGE . 3 . 2 Function of the N - terminus of Vti1p The function of the N - terminus of Vti1p is not known , so far . Using the N - terminal mutants of Vti1p , the function of N - terminus could be studied well . Random mutagenesis of VTI1 gene generated a mutation with no big change in the SNARE motif and 7 amino acid exchanges . The N - terminus with 2 amino acid mutation till AA105 was cloned into wild type Vti1p . This 2 AA mutant allele , vtiQ29RW79R ( 2 AA mutant ) caused phenotype . From the 2 AA allele , the 1 AA alleles ( vtiQ29R and vtiW79R ) were cloned separately , to study the effects of 1 AA replacement . 3 . 2 . 1 Localization of N - terminal mutants The localization of the mutant Vti1p in FvmY6pBK120 cells ( vti1 ∆ vtiQ29RW79R on CEN plasmid ) was done by immunofluresecence with antibody against Vti1p . At 24°C , Vti1p is localized to Golgi and pre - vacuolar membrane as punctate structures both in WT and in the mutant , but in the mutant some staining around the ER could also be seen ( Fig . 12a ) . Protein synthesis was arrested by addition of 100 μ g / ml Cycloheximide , to check whether the newly synthesized protein is accumulated in the ER or the localization of the mutant Vti1p itself is in the ER . Cycloheximide was added to the pre - incubated cells at 24°C , further incubated for 30 min and then fixed at the respective temperatures . 82 3 Results At 24°C with cycloheximide , vtiQ29RW79Rp was still localized to the punctate structures . When the cells were shifted to 37°C for 30 min , a clear relocalization of vtiQ29RW79Rp to ER was observed , even after the treatment of cycloheximide ( Fig . 12b ) . The effect was not altered by deleting ENT3 , an interacting partner for the N - terminus of Vti1p , in the background of vtiQ29RW79R . But the 2 AA mutant was expressed from a CEN plasmid which led to mild over expression of the protein . When the mutation was integrated into the genomic locus , the ER staining had disappeared and normal punctate staining pattern was observed as shown in the Fig . 12b ( lower panel ) . Thus , vti1Q29RW49Rp was localized to ER under slightly over expressing conditions . This delocalization is due to the mutation because over expression of wild type VTI1 using a 2 μ plasmid does not result in ER localization .

By Indirect immuno - fluorescence , the 2 AA mutant was detected using the antibody against Vti1p . DAPI staining was done to localize nucleus . The 2 AA mutant was expressed from CEN plasmid except in the lower panel ( SCY14 ) . The localization of 1 AA mutants were strikingly different from the 2 AA mutants which was also slightly over expressed from the CEN plasmids . Both the 1 AA mutants were found on vacuolar membranes and on internal small structures ( Fig . 12c ) . 84 3 Results DIC Vti1p DAPI Merge vti1Q29R vti1W79R Fig . 12c . Localization of 1 AA mutants at 37°C : The 1 AA mutants vti1Q29R and vti1W79R were fixed at 37°C and by Indirect immunoflurescence , the 1 AA mutatnt Vti1p was detected . The DIC pictures were made to clearly localize the vacuoles . DIC : Differential Interference Contrast . 3 . 2 . 2 CPY sorting by mutant Vti1p Carboxypeptidase Y traffics from the ER to the vacuole via the pre - vacuolar compartment and exists in three different forms . When there is a block in the traffic step , the corresponding form of the CPY accumulates intracellular or the Golgi form is secreted into the medium which can be analyzed by SDS gel . The CPY pathway was analyzed in the 2 AA mutants by pulse chase immunoprecipitation at 24°C and 37°C and for 1 AA mutants at 37°C ( Fig . 13 ) . IP was done both from the cell pellet ( I ) and the extracellular medium ( E ) . In 2 AA mutants ( CEN ) at 37°C , only 33 . 5 % of CPY was processed to the mature form ( I ) and p2CPY was secreted out into the medium ( E ) whereas this defect was not observed at 24°C . So , the 2 AA mutation is temperature sensitive . But in the case of 1 AA mutants , the CPY pathway was not affected . When the 2 AA mutation was integrated into the genome , the biosynthetic defect was even stronger and the percentage of mCPY was drastically reduced from 33 . 5 to 5 ( Fig . 14 ) . Also , more p2CPY was present in the cell pellet ( 24 % ) with slightly increased levels of p1CPY . To check , whether the 2 AA mutation has a dominant negative effect , the mutation was over expressed from a 2 μ plasmid in the wild type cells and the CPY pathway was analyzed by pulse chase immuno - precipitation . But the mutation did not show any dominant negative effect ( Fig . 14 ) . 3 Results 85 I E vti1 Q29R W79R vti1 Q29R vti1 W79R p2CPY p1CPY mCPY I E I E I E vti1Q29RW79R 24°C 37°C % mCPY 92 . 4 33 . 5 97 94 Fig . 13 .

The three forms of CPY , p1CPY ( from ER , 67 kDa ) , p2CPY ( from Golgi , 69 kDa ) and mCPY ( from Vacuole , 61 kDa ) were separated on a SDS gel . The percentage of mCPY was calculated . Fig . 14 .

The 2 AA mutant was very unstable , compared with 1 AA mutants ( Fig . 16 ) . After 5 h of chase , only 33 % of the Vti1p was present in the 2 AA mutant ( on an average of 3 experiments ) whereas in the wild type cells 85 % of Vti1p was present which showed that wildtype Vti1p is very stable . The 1 AA mutants didn’t show significant instability of Vti1p ( average of 2 experiments ) . The genomically integrated 2 AA mutant Vti1p ( SCY14 ) was highly unstable , only 17 % was present after 5 h chase ( on an average of three experiments ) . vti1 Q29R vti1 W79R vti1 Q29R W79R SEY6210 10‘ 2h 5h 10‘ 2h 5h 10‘ 2h 5h 10‘ 2h 5h Vti1p % of Vti1p 80 33 100 72 95 70 93 85 Fig . 16 . Stability of Vti1p in 1 AA and 2 AA mutants : The WT and the mutant cells were labeled with 35 S for 25 min , chased for 10’ , 2h and 5h at 37°C and Vti1p was immunoprecipitated . The percentage of Vti1p was calculated for each time point . 3 Results 87 3 . 2 . 4 vtiQ29RW79R p is not degraded by Vacuolar proteases Since the 2 AA mutant was highly unstable , it was very interesting to study how it would get degraded . Vacuolar proteinases are important for the vacuolar degradation of proteins , among which Proteinase A , coded by the PEP4 gene plays an important role since it activates all vacuolar proteases . The stability of Vti1p was studied in the wild type , 2 AA mutant and in the pep4 deletion strains by pulse chase immunoprecipitation of Vti1p at 10 min and at 5 h chase points , at 37°C ( Fig . 17 ) . Vti1p was degraded by the vacuolar degradation pathway , because the pep4 deletion in the wildtype cells stabilized Vti1p , increasing the percentage of Vti1p remaining after 5 h , from 49 to 113 % . But in the 2 AA mutant , pep4 deletion did not have any effect which demonstrated that the 2 AA mutant Vti1p was not degraded by the vacuolar degradation pathway .

The percentage of Vti1p remaining after 5 h compared to the 10 min chase point was calculated . 3 . 2 . 5 Polyubiquitination is required for vtiQ29RW79R p degradation Proteasome mediated proteolysis is the major pathway for protein degradation in the cells apart from the vacuolar / lysosomal degradation . Proteasomes are multi - protein complexes found in the cytosol and the nucleus ( reviewed in : Coux et al . , 1996 ) . The means of targeting proteins to proteasomes is by their modification with chains of ubiquitin . Ubiquitination is an essential cellular process effected by a multi - enzyme cascade involving classes of enzymes known as E1s ( ubiquitin - activating enzymes ) , E2s ( ubiquitin - conjugating enzymes or Ubcs ) , and E3s ( ubiquitin - protein ligases ) ( reviewed in : Bonifacino and Weissman , 1998 ) . Ubc7p is an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme , involved in the ER - associated protein degradation pathway which requires Cue1p for 88 3 Results recruitment to the ER membrane . Cue1p can bind ubiquitin to facilitate intramolecular monoubiquitination . The Cue1p - Ubc7p complex is not only required for degradation of luminal ER protein but also for membrane proteins which are anchored with their tails in the cytosolic face of the ER membranes ( like SNAREs ) . Ubiquitin is attached to lysine on a target protein or to another ubiquitin chain at K48 of ubiquitin , resulting in the generation of chains of ubiquitin which is referred to as either polyubiquitination or multiubiquitination . The formation of the K48 linked polyubiquitin chains on proteins constitutes a potent targeting signal for degradation in 26S proteasomes . To check whether the 2 AA mutant was degraded by the proteasomes , CUE1 and UBC7 genes were deleted in the 2 AA mutant background . Also , a plasmid expressing the mutant ubiquitin in which lysine 48 has been mutated to an arginine ( K48R ) was transformed into the 2 AA mutants . The K48R mutation renders ubiquitin unable to form poly - ubiquitin chains , thus preventing the proteasomal degradation . The stability of mutant Vti1p was studied in these strains by pulse chase immunoprecipitation ( Fig . 18 ) . Vti1p was not stabilized in the cue1 and ubc7 deletions . But the ubK48R stabilized the mutant Vti1p from 16 % to 63 % at 3h and from 10 % to 41 % at 5 h . So , polyubiquitination was required for the degradation of the mutant Vti1p . % Vti1p vti1Q29RW79R cue1 ∆ vti1Q29RW79Rubc7 ∆ vti1Q29RW79R ubK48R Vti1p 10‘ 3h 5h 10‘ 3h 5h 10‘ 3h 5h 10‘ 3h 5h 16 10 23 16 25 13 63 41 vti1Q29RW79R Fig . 18 . Vti1p stability in Proteasomal mutants : The 2 AA mutant ( SCY14 ) , 2 AA mutant with cue1 ∆ ( SCY22 ) , 2 AA mutant with ubc7 ∆ ( SCY21 ) and 2 AA mutant with ubK48R ( SCY14 - pUB203 ) were used for the pulse chase immunoprecipitation of Vti1p at 10 min , 3 h and 5h , at 37°C . 3 Results 89 3 . 3 Characterization of Ent proteins in S . cerevisiae 3 . 3 . 1 Role of Ent proteins in the trafficking of CPY and ALP In several ent deletion mutants , CPY transport was analyzed by pulse chase labeling followed by immunoprecipitation at 37°C ( Fig . 19 ) . No defects in CPY maturation were observed in ent 4 ∆ and ent 5 ∆ cells . Slightly elevated levels of p2CPY were secreted into the medium ( E ) by ent3 ∆ ( 6 . 2 % ) and ent3 ∆ ent 4 ∆ ( 4 . 6 % ) cells even though most CPY reached the vacuole ( mCPY in the intracellular fraction I ) . p2CPY is secreted from the cells if transport from the TGN to the vacuole is defective . ent3 ∆ ent 5 ∆ and ent3 ∆ ent 4 ∆ ent 5 ∆ cells secreted even more p2CPY ( 9 . 3 % and 8 . 1 % respectively ) and accumulated p2CPY within the cells . This slight transport defect indicates that Ent3p and Ent5p have a partially redundant function in CPY transport . e n t 3 ∆ e n t 4 ∆ e n t 5 ∆ e n t 3 ∆ e n t 4 ∆ e n t 3 ∆ e n t 5 ∆ e n t 4 ∆ e n t 5 ∆ e n t 3 ∆ S E Y 6 2 1 0 I E I E I E I E I E I E % mCPY p1CPYp2CPY mCPY 85 . 5 91 . 5 82 . 6 95 88 . 6 96 Fig . 19 .

ALP transport in ent mutants : Pulse chase labeling and immunoprecipitation of ALP was done at 37°C . pALP : proALP ; mALP : mature ALP ( vacuolar form ) . 3 . 3 . 2 Ent3p binds phosphoinositides Ent3p binds the clathrin adaptor Gga2p and has been implicated in clathrin coated vesicle formation at the Golgi or endosome ( Duncan et al . , 2003 ) . Different phosphoinositides are regulators of trafficking in these organelles in yeast ( Simonsen et al . , 2001 ) . PI ( 4 ) P is implicated in secretory traffic from the Golgi to the plasma membrane , PI ( 3 ) P in traffic to the endosome and autophagocytosis . PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 is required for sorting into the internal vesicles in prevacuolar endosomes to form multivesicular bodies . To detect whether Ent3p has any specificity towards phosphoinositides , the strep - tagged ENTH domain of Ent3p was bacterially expressed , purified and incubated with liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) and phosphoinositol ( PI ) as controls along with the above mentioned phosphoinositides . Ent3p bound specifically to liposomes with PI ( 3 ) P and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 21 ) . Fig . 21 . Ent3p binding to phosphoinositides : The ENTH domain of Ent3p with a C - terminal Strep tag was incubated with liposomes containing 70 % PC , 20 % PE and10 % of the indicated lipids . Liposomes were pelleted and recruitment of Ent3p was followed by separation of the pellet fraction by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie blue staining . 30 % : 30 % of the protein used in the assay was loaded for comparison . 3 Results 91 3 . 3 . 3 Localization of Ent3p and Ent5p in wildtype and in mutant cell 3 . 3 . 3 . 1 Localization of endogenous Ent3p using antibody against Ent3p Initially , the localization of Ent3p was analyzed using Ent3p tagged with 3 copies of the HA epitope at the C - terminus which turned out to be non functional because it did not complement for the loss of Ent3p in Y24 ent3 ∆ cells in the growth test at 37°C . Therefore we cannot rely on the Ent3p - HA data . Anti - Ent3p rabbit serum was raised against a Strep - ENTH domain of Ent3p which recognized specifically a protein with the expected molecular weight for Ent3p at around 50 kDa in a whole - yeast wild - type cell extract , but not in an ent3 ∆ cell extract both in SEY6210 and BY4742 background , as shown in the Fig . 22a . Subcellular fractionation of wild type cells showed that Ent3p was more cytosolic ( S200 ) and less associated with the membrane fraction ( P13 ) , when the lysis was done very gently after spheroplasting by homogenization with lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 0 . 15 M potassium acetate , 10mM MgCl2 and 0 . 25 M Sorbitol with protease inhibitors ( Fig . 22b , SEY6210 cells ) . But when the lysis was done vigorously by glass beads with the same lysis buffer , Ent3p was more associated with membrane fractions ( Fig . 22b , SEY6210 cells ) . The P13 fraction contains vacuoles , mitochondrial and ER - membrane , the P200 fraction contains small vesicles and the Golgi and the S200 fraction derives all cyosolic proteins . Since , Ent3p and Vti1p are interacting partners , it was important to test whether Vti1p is required for the localization of Ent3p . Subcellular fractionation was done from several vti1 mutants like SNARE motif mutants ( vti1 - 1 and vti1 - 2 ) , N - terminal 2AA mutant ( vtiQ29RW79R ) and the N - terminal truncations ( vti1Q116 - 217 and vti1M55 - 217 ) , to detect the localization of Ent3p , both by gentle ( Fig . 22b ) and harsh ( Fig . 22c ) methods of lysis . The N - terminal truncations express Vti1p amino acids from 55 to 217 [ vti1M55 - 217 ( FvmY6 - pBK117 ) ] , from 116 to 217 [ vti1Q116 - 217 ( FvmY6 - pBK117 ) ] and an additional start ‘methionine’ under a constitutive promoter 789 . These mutants exhibit slow growth , strong CPY sorting defects at all temperatures and lacks complete N - terminus involved in Ent3p interaction ( amino acids 1 - 115 ) . 92 3 Results SEY 6210 en t 3 ∆ SEY 6210 BY 4742 en t 3 ∆ en t 5 ∆ BY 4742 kDa 75 50 35 25 10 Ent3p Fig . 22a . Generation of anti - Ent3p rabbit serum : Serum from the terminal bleed of the strep - Ent3p injected rabbit ( ywop ( t ) ) was diluted to 1 : 500 and used for probing the blot with protein extracts from SEY6210 , ent3 ∆ SEY6210 ( SCY2 ) , BY4742 and ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ BY4742 ( BKY13 ) . In SEY6210 cells , a single band at 50 kDa , corresponding to Ent3p was detected . In other cells a mild cross reaction of anti - Ent3p was observed . The cells were lysed in 1ml lysis buffer and fractionated . The pellet fractions were resuspended in 70 μ l of lysis buffer , protein concentration was quantified and equal amounts of protein were loaded on the gel . In wild type cells , around 1 . 3 % of Ent3p was present in the P13 fraction , 98 % in S200 and rest in the P200 by gentle lysis ( Fig . 22b ) . But , by harsh method of lysis , 65 % of Ent3p was present in the P13 , 8 % in P200 and 27 % in S200 ( Fig . 22c ) . In vti1 mutants , more or less , the same range of Ent3p was found by both the methods . Though , Ent3p was present more in the P13 fraction in the vti1 mutants compared to wild type ( Fig . 22b ) , the consequent decrease in other fractions ( S200 ) was not observed . On the other hand , fractionation done by the harsh lysis method ( Fig . 22b ) , showed that there was no apparent relocalization of Ent3p in the N - term truncations ( since the N - term of Vti1p interacts with Ent3p , these mutants are the perfect tools to study the redistribution of Ent3p ) . The vacuolar ATPase , Vph1p was used as a control for the experiment ( to check for rupture of vacuole during lysis ) . Vph1p is associated only with the P13 fraction but because of the glass beads , vacuoles might have got damaged , 3 Results 93 so it was seen in the P200 fraction also . These data showed that there was no redistribution of Ent3p in the vti1 mutants .

The percentage of Ent3p present in P13 was 1 . 3 , in P200 was 0 . 33 and 98 . 38 in S200 . In other cells also the same range of total protein was protein .

Equal amount of protein was loaded . Load : 70 μ g of protein per well . In SEY6210 cells , total protein in H was 2800 μ g , in P13 ( 710 μ g ) , in P200 ( 720 μ g ) and 945 μ g in S200 . The percentage of Ent3p present in P13 was 65 % , in P200 was 8 % and 27 % in S200 . 94 3 Results 3 . 3 . 3 . 2 Fluorescence microscopy of Ent3p - GFP Since the antiserum against Ent3p was not suitable for the immunofluorescence studies , Ent3p with a C - terminal GFP ( pSC22 ) was constructed . This construct was transformed into the wildtype cells and vti1 mutants and imaged using a fluorescence microscope ( Fig . 23 ) . Ent3p was localized into few punctate structures possibly corresponding to endosomes and mostly diffused in the cytoplasm irrespective of the temperature . In the vti1 mutants , there was no marked difference in the localization of the Ent3p . But , sometimes , in the N - term truncation , vti1Q116 - 217 ( Y6pBK117 ) ( Fig . 23b ) , a number of punctate structures were observed which was completely different from the wild type , although majority of the cells exhibited the same fluorescence pattern like the wild type ( Fig . 23a ) . Taking in account the subcellular fractionation and the fluorescence data , it was showed that Ent3p was not dependent on Vti1p for its localization . ent3 ∆ ENT3GFP vti1 - 2 ENT3GFP vti1Q29RW79R ENT3GFP vti1M55 - 217 ENT3GFP vti1Q116 - 217 ENT3GFP ( a ) ( b ) Fig . 23 .

The wildtype and the mutants harbouring the ENT5GFP plasmid ( pSC24 ) were lysed gently by homogenization and fractionated ( starting volume 1 ml ) . The P13 and P200 fractions were resuspended in 100 μ l and 80 μ l respectively and equal 3 Results 95 volume was loaded on the gel . The blot was probed with antisera against GFP and Vph1p ( Fig . 24a ) . Ent5p - GFP was detected around 85 kDa and present nearly 20 % in the P200 , 74 % in S200 fraction and rest in the P13 fraction in wild type cells . Interestingly , the membrane associated Ent5p - GFP was found predominantly in P200 while Ent3p - GFP was more prominent in P13 even though both proteins were largely cytosolic . No change in the localization of Ent5p was observed in vti1 mutants ( Fig . 24b ) . Fig . 24 . Subcellular fractionation of Ent5p - GFP : The strains ( a ) ent5 ∆ ENT5GFP ( SCY25 pSC24 ) , vti1Q29RW79R ENT5GFP ( SCY14 pSC24 ) , vti1Q116 - 217 ENT5GFP ( Y6pBK117 pSC24 ) and ( b ) vti1 - 2 ENT5GFP ( FvMY24 pSC24 ) , were gently lysed by homogenization and the homogenate ( from 20 OD of cells ) fractionated ( starting material 1 ml ) . The fractions were detected with antisera against GFP and Vph1p ( vacuolar ATPase , as a control ) ( a ) . Equal volumes of the samples were loaded . Some nonspecific band around 80 kDa with more or less same distribution pattern like Ent5p - GFP was observed in blot ( b ) which may be due to degradation . 3 . 3 . 3 . 4 Ent5p - GFP localization Ent5p was localized to punctuate structures in wild - type cells as well as in vti1 - 2 cells ( Fig . 25i ) . vti1Q29RW79R cells were stained like wild - type but sometimes it showed many punctuate structures which could not be seen after few hours even from the same culture . Like Ent3p - GFP , in some vti1Q116 - 217 ( N - terminal truncation ) cells Ent5p was localized to many small punctuate structures and in some cells , it was localized to a few larger structure , sometimes close to vacuole possibly endosomes ( Fig . 25i ( a ) ) .

The uptake was delayed by 60 min when still some intermediate endosomal structures were also stained along with vacuoles . This indicates that transport from the endosomes to vacuoles was delayed in vti1Q116 - 217 cells . The vacuolar morphology of the vti1Q116 - 217 cells seems to be normal but the structure of the endosomes was not clear . ent5 ∆ ENT5GFP vti1Q116 - 217 ENT5GFP ( a ) vti1 - 2 ENT5GFP vti1Q29RW79R ENT5GFP Fig . 25 ( i ) .

Uptake of FM4 - 64 dye in N - terminal truncation : SEY6210 and vti1Q116 - 217 cells were incubated with FM4 - 64 dye at 24°C for 10 min ( pulse ) and the cells were viewed after an additional incubation ( chase ) of 10 min or 30 min or 60 under the microscope . 3 . 3 . 4 Overexpression of Ent3p C - terminus and Ent3p in vti1 mutants The over expression of the C - terminus of the ENTH domain protein Epsin1 has a dominant negative effect in mammalian cells ( Itoh et al . , 2001 ) . A dominant negative effect can also be observed if a redundant protein is present . The C - terminus of Ent3p was over - expressed from a 2 μ plasmid , to check whether it has a dominant negative effect on transport to the vacuole . Pulse chase immuno precipitation of CPY was done from SEY6210 and vti1Q29RW79R cells expressing the C - terminus of ENT3 ( pSC2 ) ( Fig . 26a ) . There was no dominant negative effect from the C - terminus of Ent3p . Then the full length Ent3p ( pSC4 ) was overexpressed in the vti1 mutants , to check whether the full length protein is able to suppress CPY sorting defects in vti1 mutants ( Fig . 26b ) . It did not improve the sorting and showed neither dominant negative defect nor suppression in the 2 AA mutant . 98 3 Results Vti1Q29RW79R 2 μ ENT3C - term SEY6210 p2CPYp1CPY mCPY vti1Q29RW79R / 2 μ ENT3 C - term 72 . 6 68 . 8 90 . 8 I E I E I E % mCPY vti1Q29RW79R vti1Q29RW79R 2 μ ENT3 vti1 - 1 vti1 - 1 2 μ ENT3 vti1 - 2 vti1 - 2 2 μ ENT3 4 . 5 8 . 4 37 33 8 . 0 7 . 0 % of mCPY I E I E I E I E I E I E p2CPYp1CPY mCPY ( a ) ( b ) Fig . 26 .

The uptake was analyzed at different time points . There was no delay in the uptake of FM4 - 64 in the single ent mutants , ent3 ∆ ent4 ∆ and ent4 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells . In ent3 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent5 ∆ and ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ , except very few cells which looked abnormal , in other cells the uptake was normal .

The absence of Ent3p reduced mCPY levels in vti1 - 1 cells ( SCY3 ) from 64 . 3 % ( SD 12 . 0 ) to 11 . 9 % ( SD 5 . 8 , n = 3 ) at a 33°C ( Fig . 28a ) . Lack of Ent5p ( BKY15 ) did not lead to a synthetic defect . vti1 - 2 cells are defective in transport from the Golgi to the prevacuole as well as in transport to the vacuole . The deletion of Ent3p in the vti1 - 2 cells ( SCY1 ) reduced mCPY levels from 33 % to 3 . 5 % . The 2 AA N - terminal mutant , vti1Q29RW79R has a defect and only 33 . 5 % of mCPY was present at 37°C ( Fig . 28b ) . The biosynthetic defect was pronounced in vti1Q29RW79R when ent3 ( SCY6 ) was deleted , in which only 13 . 5 % of CPY was processed to the mature form at 37°C . There was no synthetic defect by the absence of Ent3p in the 1 AA mutants vti1Q29R ( SCY8 ) and vti1W79R ( SCY9 ) . 100 3 Results I E I E vti1 - 2 vti1 - 2 ent3 ∆ % mCPY 64 12 73 33 3 . 5 I E I E vti1 Q29R vti1 W79R p2CPY p1CPYmCPY vti1 Q29R ∆ ent3 I E vti1 W79R ∆ ent3 I E 97 86 94 90 . 5 I E I E 13 . 5 33 . 5 v t i 1 Q 29 R W 79 R v t i 1 Q 29 R W 79 R ∆ en t 3 p2CPY p1CPYmCPY ( a ) ( b ) Fig . 28 .

Pulse chase immuno precipitation of ALP was done in the mutants ( Fig . 29 ) . A deletion of ent3 did not result in reduced appearance of vacuolar mALP in vti1 - 1 and vti1Q29RW79R cells at semi permissive temperature ( Fig . 29a ) . Slightly less mALP was found in the absence of Ent5p in vti1 - 2 ( BKY16 ) cells but not in the absence of Ent3p , after both a 5 min and a 30 min chase period ( Fig . 29b ) . After 30 min chase vti1 - 2 and vti1 - 2 ent3 ∆ cells had 75 . 5 % ( SD 1 . 5 ) and 73 . 9 % ( SD 0 . 1 ) mALP respectively , but in the vti1 - 2 ent5 ∆ had 60 % ( SD1 . 0 , n = 2 ) of mALP . 3 Results 101 97 97 v t i 1 Q 29 R W 79 R vti1Q29RW79R ∆ ent3 vti1 - 1 vti1 - 1 ∆ ent3 95 . 8 100 pALP mALP % mALP ( A ) ( B ) Fig . 29 .

There was no synthetic growth defect in the deletion mutants except in vti1 - 2 mutants . vti1 - 2 cells grow very slowly at 37°C . Both vti1 - 2ent3 ∆ and vti1 - 2ent5 ∆ cells were unable to grow at 37°C ( Fig . 30 ) . The synthetic growth defect in vti1 - 2ent3 ∆ cells is probably due to reduced trafficking through the prevacuole which was detected as synthetic defect in CPY maturation ( Fig . 28a ) . The small synthetic defects in ALP maturation may be the reason for the synthetic growth defect in vti1 - 2ent5 ∆ cells ( Fig . 29b ) . Fig . 30 . Synthetic growth defect in vti1 - 2 mutants : The strains were grown overnight at 24°C and diluted cells were spotted on a YEPD plated , incubated at 24°C and 37°C and the growth was observed . 102 3 Results 3 . 3 . 7 Cell wall defects in ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ mutants 3 . 3 . 7 . 1 Abnormal cell shapes in ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ In the transmission light ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells looked abnormal . To study the cell morphology clearly , chitin present in the cell wall and in the bud scar was stained with calcofluor ( Fig . 31 ) . Some ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ ( BKY20 ) cells looked very abnormal in shape and displayed branched chain like budding pattern . They were larger than wild - type cells . The chitin ring was present in the bud neck of completely grown branched cells but the freshly budding cells lacked chitin in the bud neck ( Fig . 31 , lower panel , 30°C ) . The mutant cells might have delayed formation of the septum or may be defective in cell separation process . But this abnormality was not a homogenous defect . In ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ , the percentage of abnormal cells at 18°C was 20 % and at 30°C , it was 12 . 8 % . ent3 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent5 ∆ ( BKY18 ) cells displayed similar phenotypes as ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells . The rest of the cells were normal and the size was comparable to wild - type . ent3 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent5 ∆ SEY6210 ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ 18°C 30°C Fig . 31 . Calcofluor staining of ent mutants : SEY6210 , ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ ( BKY20 ) and ent3 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent5 ∆ ( BKY18 ) were grown at 24°C and shifted to 18°C or 30°C for 5 hrs or 2 hrs respectively . 10 µl of 1mg / ml calcofluor was added to the cells , incubated for 1h 30 min and imaged using a microscope . 3 Results 103 3 . 3 . 7 . 2 Irregular distribution of Chitin and Actin assembly in ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ Since the cells were abnormal in shape , it was important to study the localization of actin assembly using phalloidin - fluorophor which binds polymerized actin , along with calcofluor ( Fig . 31 ) . The yeast actin cytoskeleton is organized into atleast four biochemically and morphologically distinct structures , namely , cortical patches ( discrete cytoskeletal bodies ) , actin cables ( long bundles of actin filaments ) , the cap ( polarized accumulation of cytoskeletal and regulatory proteins ) and a cytokinetic ring ( reviewed in : Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000 ) . Cell polarity in budding yeast is established by a polarized actin cytoskeleton throughout the cell cycle . A cap ( the bud site ) of regulatory and cytoskeletal proteins establishes the polarity of actin cables and cortical patches ( G1 phase ) . Actin cables then guide secretory vesicles to the cap , where they accumulate and fuse , thus polarizing growth . During isotropic growth ( G2 and M phase ) , the proteins of the cap are more diffusely distributed , cortical patches are isotropically distributed and actin cables form a meshwork . A fourth cytoskeletal structure , a cytokinetic ring , mediates cell division when all the actin components reorient to the mother - bud junction . The chitin and actin localization in some abnormal cells were shown in Fig . 31a ( Actin and chitin localization in the same cells ) . The actin filaments were absent in the abnormal cells from ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ ( BKY20 ) . Also the number of actin patches was more in the abnormal cells . Chitin was deposited irregularly in the abnormal cells independent of the temperature . As shown in the middle panel of Fig . 31a , all the cells were attached with each other but the cell having irregular chitin deposition lacks actin staining . The initial cells in the branch lost their actin staining as the branch grew . In the abnormal cells actin cap was formed properly even if the cells were not separated and elongated ( Fig . 31a , lower panel ) . Though the actin assembly was disorganized , the abnormal cells could form new buds , but could not get separated , resulting into branched cell morphology . These observations were restricted only to the 20 % of the abnormal cells in the mutants whereas the rest of the cells exhibited wild - type phenotype . The cell cycle dependent actin localization in the normal cells of ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ was shown in Fig . 31b . 104 3 Results ent3 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent5 ∆ 18°C SEY6210 18°C ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ 30°C Actin Chitin Fig . 32a .

Since in the ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells , chitin deposition was irregular and also bud scar was not clearly present in some cells which indicated that the septum might not have formed well . Chs3p is responsible for the chitin synthesis in the septum wall formation ( Shaw et al . , 1991 ) which is transported out of ER with the help of Chs7p and targeted to the plasma membrane via the Golgi with the help of Chs5p . Before being delivered to the bud neck , chs3p is recovered from the cell surface , stored in an endocytic structure and delivered to the bud neck by the vesicles that contain Tlg1p ( Chuang and Schekman , 1996 ; Holthuis et al . , 1998 ) . The plasmids , CHS3GFP ( RSB2310 ) and CHS7 ( pSC23 ) were transformed into all the ent mutants and the localization of Chs3p was studied by GFP fluorescence ( Fig . 33 ) . Chs3p - GFP was localized into the bud neck in small budded cells and in some internal compartments in wild - type . In some wild - type cells , ER localization was also observed . It could be because of the uneven expression of Chs7p which is needed for the exit of Chs3p from the ER . In all the mutant cells , Chs3p was present in the bud neck , in some internal compartments and also in the ER . In ent3 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells , the localization of Chs3p - GFP was analyzed at 18°C , 30°C and 37°C . This experiment showed that Chs3p reached its destination in the mutants , for example , in the budding cells , Chs3p was present in the bud site and in the bud neck . The localization of Chs3p - GFP was very heterogeneous in different cells from wild type as well as in mutants . No differences in overall staining pattern were detected . 106 3 Results 37°C 30°C 18°C ent3 ∆ SEY6210 ent5 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent5 ∆ ent3 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent3 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent5 ∆ CHS7 CHS3GFP CHS7 CHS3GFP Fig . 33 .

In the lower panel , cells from 30°C were shown . 3 . 3 . 7 . 4 Aniline blue staining of ent mutants The yeast cell wall represents a complex structure of cross linked chitin , 1 , 3 - β - Glucan , 1 , 6 - β - Glucan and mannoproteins . Since chitin deposition was not regular in ent mutants , it was interesting to check whether 1 , 3 - β - glucan deposition was normal . Aniline blue ( also called as Methyl blue ) specifically stains the 1 , 3 - β - glucan layer in the cell wall . All the ent mutants were stained with aniline blue ( Fig . 34 ) . No defect in the 1 , 3 - β - glucan layer of ent mutants was observed . 3 Results 107 SEY6210 ent3 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent5 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent5 ∆ ent3 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent5 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent3 ∆ Fig . 34 .

These agents are generally used to screen cell wall mutants . Yeast cell have a rigid cell wall and higher internal turgor pressure . If the cell wall is defective , the cells can not grow on high osmotic or salt stress ( NaCl ) because of the loss of the turgor pressure . SDS , as a detergent , will solubilize protein and disrupt the architecture of the cell wall . Calcofluor white is a negatively charged fluorescent dye that binds to nascent chains of chitin and , to a lesser extent , glucan through hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions and , by preventing microfibril assembly , interferes directly with the supramolecular organization of the cell wall ( Elorza et al . , 1983 ; Murgui et al . , 1985 ; Ram et al . , 1994 ) . A disturbed or weakened cell wall is not able to withstand drug concentrations that do not affect normal wild - type cells . ent3 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent5 ∆ and ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells were sensitive to all the tested cell wall perturbing agents except that ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ was not sensitive to 1 M NaCl . ent3 ∆ was sensitive to SDS and calcofluor . This shows that ent deletions have a defective cell wall . 108 3 Results Fig . 35 .

Cells were grown at 24°C and different dilutions were spotted on YEPD plate and YEPD containing 1M NaCl , 1 . 4 M NaCl , 50 µg / ml calcofluor , 0 . 05 % SDS and incubated at 30°C . All mutants are in BY4742 background except ent3 ∆ ent4 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells which is in the mixed BY4742 x SEY6210 background . 3 . 3 . 7 . 6 Zymolyase sensitivity curve Zymolyase is a β - 1 , 3 - Glucanase enzyme which cleaves the β - 1 , 3 - glucosidic linkages . Cells would show altered sensitivity to zymolyase , if the cell wall composition was altered . Sensitivity to zymolyase may reflect changes in the β - 1 , 3 - glucan layer ( Ovalle et al . , 1998 ) or changes in the external mannoprotein layer that result in altered permeability to cell wall degrading enzymes ( De Nobel et al . , 1991 ) . ent mutants were incubated with zymolyase and every one hour the optical densitiy was measured ( Fig . 36 ) . ∆ ent3 cells behaved like the wild type cells whereas ∆ ent5 and ∆ ent3 ∆ ent5 were more resistant to zymolyase which showed that the cell wall composition was altered in ∆ ent3 ∆ ent5 and ∆ ent5 mutants . 3 Results 109 % SEY6210 ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ 0 1 2 3 hours Fig . 36 . Zymolyase sensitivity curve : SEY6210 , ∆ ent3 ( SCY2 ) , ∆ ent5 ( SCY25 ) and ∆ ent3 ∆ ent5 ( SCY26 ) cells were grown overnight at 24°C and incubated with zymolyase ( 5µg / ml ) at 37°C .

OD : optical density . 3 . 3 . 8 Interaction of Ent3p with Pep12p and Syn8p 3 . 3 . 8 . 1 Two hybrid interactions of Ent3p A two hybrid assay was done in the group to find out whether Ent3p interacts with other SNARE proteins apart from Vti1p ( Fig . 37a ) . Interestingly , Ent3p interacted with the N - terminal domains of Syn8p and Pep12p which are present in the endosomal SNARE complex with Vti1p and didn’t interact with Tlg1p . EpsinR was used as a control . This two hybrid interaction was confirmed further by an in vitro pull down assay using His tagged Vti1p , Pep12p , Tlg1p and Syn8p with Strep tagged Ent3p ( Fig . 37b ) . 110 3 Results Fig . 37 . ( a ) Two hybrid interactions were detected between Ent3p and Syn8p and Pep12p . No interaction was found with Tlg1p . The interactions with EpsinR were used as a negative control . ( b ) In vitro binding assay was done as mentioned before with slight changes in the binding buffer . 1 / 20 Ent3p - Strep : 1 / 20 of the protein used in the assay . 3 . 3 . 8 . 2 Pep12p and vti1 - 2p are stabilized in ent3 ∆ cells The stability of Pep12p and vti1 - 2p were studied in the ent mutants by pulse chase immuno precipitation of Pep12p and Vti1p ( Fig . 38 ) . vti1 - 2p was more stable when ent3 was deleted ( Fig . 38a ) and the same was true for Pep12p ( SCY2 ) ( Fig . 38b ) . The amount of vti1 - 2p after 2 h chase in vti1 - 2 was 81 . 37 % ( SD 41 , n = 3 ) , in vti1 - 2ent3 ∆ 116 . 4 % ( SD 26 ) and in SEY6210 97 % ( SD 5 . 7 ) . Absence of Ent5p ( SCY25 ) did not lead to stabilization of Pep12p . In ∆ ent3 ∆ ent5 ( SCY26 ) , a slight stabilization of Pep12p could be observed . After 3 h of chase , 26 . 9 % [ SD 0 . 2 , n = 3 ] Pep12p was present in the wild type , 28 . 25 % ( SD 8 . 13 ) in ent5 ∆ cells whereas in ent3 ∆ , 56 . 5 % [ SD 10 . 6 , n = 3 ] was present . In ∆ ent3 ∆ ent5 cells , 34 . 7 % ( SD 5 . 6 ) Pep12p was found . After 5 h of chase , the amount of Pep12p in wild type was 13 % ( n = 1 ) , in ent3 ∆ 33 . 6 % , in ent5 ∆ 10 . 5 % and in ∆ ent3 ∆ ent5 25 . 6 % . The epistatic effect of ENT5 might have masked the effect of ENT3 , resulting in less stabilization of Pep12p in ∆ ent3 ∆ ent5 . Three experiments were done which were reproducible both for vti1 - 2p and Pep12p . Ent3p might be required for the anterograde transport of Pep12p and vti1 - 2p . 3 Results 111 Fig . 38 . Stability of Pep12p and vti1 - 2p in ent mutants : Cells grown at 24°C were labeled with radioactive methionine for 30min and chased for 10 min or 2h or 3h or for 5h at 37°C . Vti1p ( a ) and Pep12p ( b ) were immunoprecipitated from cellular extracts , separated by SDS - PAGE and quantified by phospho imager . 3 . 3 . 8 . 3 Localization of Pep12p in ent deletion cells Indirect immuno fluorescence of Pep12p was done in the ent mutants to study the localization of Pep12p ( Fig . 39 ) . Both in wildtype and mutant cells , Pep12p was localized to punctuate structures corresponding to prevacuolar endosomes . Pep12p localization was not affected in the ent mutants . This should be further confirmed by sucellular fractionation of the ent mutants . ent3 ∆ SEY6210 ent5 ∆ ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ Fig . 39 . Immunofluorescence of Pep12p in ent deletion cells : SEY6210 , ∆ ent3 ( SCY2 ) , ∆ ent5 ( SCY25 ) , ∆ ent3 ∆ ent5 ( SCY26 ) cells were fixed , treated with monoclonal antibody against Pep12p and using a fluorescing secondary antibody , Pep12p was localized . 112 3 Results 3 . 3 . 8 . 4 Synthetic growth defect of pep12 deletion in ent mutants To study the genetic interaction between PEP12 and ENT , the mutants were scored for growth at 37°C ( Fig . 40 ) . ent3 ∆ pep12 ∆ and ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ pep12 ∆ cells could not grow at 37°C . When cells were grown on plates containing 1 M NaCl and 1 . 4 M NaCl at 30°C , ent3 ∆ pep12 ∆ and ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ pep12 ∆ showed a synthetic growth defect . The cells did not grow on plates containing calcofluor and SDS ( even the SEY6210 wild type ) . Only cells from the BY4742 background could grow on calcofluor and SDS .

All the mutants are in SEY6210 / 6211 background . 3 . 3 . 8 . 5 vti1 - 2p was destabilized in ent5 ∆ The vti1 - 2p was stabilized in the absence of Ent3p but destabilized by the absence of Ent5p ( SCY25 ) , shown by pulse chase immuno precipitation of Vti1p at 37°C ( Fig . 41a ) . After 5 h of chase the amount of vti1 - 2p in vti1 - 2 cells was , 71 % [ SD 4 . 2 ( n = 3 ) ] , which was reduced to 47 % [ SD 1 . 3 , ( n = 3 ) ] in vti1 - 2ent5 ∆ cells . In vti1 - 2ent5 ∆ pep4 ∆ ( SCY23 ) cells , similar amounts of vti1 - 2p remained after 3 h and 5 h compared to vti1 - 2pep4 ∆ ( MDY7 ) . This indicated that the vti1 - 2p was degraded by the vacuolar degradation pathway . But this effect was temperature dependent . At 30°C , vti1 - 2p was neither destabilized in the absence of Ent5p nor stabilized in the absence of Ent3p ( Fig . 41b ) . 3 Results 113 % 10‘ 10‘ 10‘ 10‘ 3h 3h 3h 3h 5h 5h 5h 5h vti1 - 2 vti1 - 2 ∆ ent5 vti1 - 2 ∆ pep4 vti1 - 2 ∆ pep4 ∆ ent5 Vti1p ( A ) ( B ) chase Fig . 41 .

Pulse chase immuno precipitation of Vti1p was done at 37°C from the ent mutants ( Fig . 42 ) . There was no difference in the stability of Vti1p between the wild type and ent3 ∆ ( SCY2 ) , ent5 ∆ ( SCY25 ) and ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ ( SCY26 ) . Vti1p was stabilized in pep4 ∆ ( BKY12 ) , ent3 ∆ pep4 ∆ ( SCY28 ) and ent5 ∆ pep4 ∆ ( SCY24 ) .

Both in the wild type and in the mutants , Vti1p was present in the P13 and P200 ( in pre vacuolar membrane and in Golgi ) . Vph1p , vacuolar ATPase and PGK , a soluble protein were used as controls . There was no redistribution of Vti1p in the ent mutants .

To check whether deletion of ent3 or ent5 affected the amounts of SNAREs present in the complex , immunoprecipitaion was done using Pep12p antibody from ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ ( SCY26 ) ( Fig . 45 ) . A co - immuno - precipitation of Vti1p was observed . There was no change in the amounts of Vti1p which co - immnuoprecipitated with Pep12p in the ent mutant . 116 3 Results Vti1p Pep12p SEY 6210 H UN H UN ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ pre SYN8HA pre SEY 6210 ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ SEY 6210 ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ beads Fig . 45 .

H : homogenate ; UN : unbound ; pre : preimmune . 3 . 3 . 10 Retrograde transport of A - ALP and Vps10p To study if Ent5p or Ent3p were involved in the retrograde transport , the stability of A - ALP and Vps10p which recycle between TGN and endosome , was analyzed ( Fig . 46 ) . Vps10p is a receptor that sorts several different vacuolar proteins by cycling between a late Golgi compartment and the endosome . Vps10p is the receptor for CPY . A - ALP consists of the cytosolic domain of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A [ DPAP A ] fused to the transmembrane and lumenal domains of the alkaline phosphatase [ ALP ] ) , which localizes to the yeast TGN . The cytosolic tail of DPAP A confers recycling between the TGN and the endosome . The delivery of this protein to the vacuole can be monitored by proteolytic maturation of proALP . Pulse chase immuno precipitation of A - ALP was done from ent deletions in pho8 ( which codes for ALP ) deleted cells , transformed with the A - ALP plasmid ( Fig . 46a ) . After 120 min of chase , 59 . 4 % ( n = 1 ) mALP was present in pho8 ∆ cells , 52 . 8 % in pho8 ∆ ent3 ∆ ( BKY25 ) , 54 . 4 % in pho8 ∆ ent5 ∆ ( BKY26 ) . There was no destabilization of A - ALP in the mutants . The amount of Vps10p in wild type cells was 110 % ( n = 1 ) , in ent3 ∆ ( SCY2 ) 119 % , in ent5 ∆ ( SCY25 ) 272 % and in ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ ( SCY26 ) 115 % ( Fig . 46b ) . The high value in ent5 ∆ cells might be due to technical problems since the 3 h band was optically comparable with other strains . Vps10p was also not affected in the ent mutants . 3 Results 117 pho8 ∆ pho8 ∆ ent3 ∆ pho8 ∆ ent5 ∆ 5‘ 30‘ 60‘ 120‘ 5‘ 30‘ 60‘ 120‘ 5‘ 30‘ 60‘ 120‘ A - ALP A ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ 10‘ 3h 10‘ 3h 10‘ 3h 10‘ 3h SEY6210 Vps10p Vps10p * ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ B chase chase Fig . 46 .

These pathways were analyzed in the ent mutants to investigate the involvement of Ent proteins in this transport route ( Fig . 47 ) . pApe1p would appear if the CVT pathway or the autophagy was blocked . In ent3 ∆ , pApe1p was present more in the log phase cells . But , the ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells did not have pApe1p in both the phases . There may be some factors in ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells which rescued the effect of ent3 ∆ or the comparatively slow growth of ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells might have induced autophagy and pApe1p was processed . In the nitrogen starved cells , Ape1p was processed properly showing that autophagy was not affected by Ent proteins . 118 3 Results pApe1p Ape1p en t 3 ∆ en t 5 ∆ SEY 6210 en t 3 ∆ en t 5 ∆ en t 3 ∆ en t 5 ∆ en t 3 ∆ en t 5 ∆ en t 3 ∆ en t 5 ∆ en t 3 ∆ en t 5 ∆ stationary phase starved phase SEY 6210 SEY 6210 log phase Fig . 47 .

In the first part , the importance of the N - terminus of Vti1p is discussed and in the second part the interaction between Vti1p and Ent3p is elaborated with comments on the characterization of the ent mutants . 4 . 1 Function of the N - terminus of Vti1p The N - terminal domains of all syntaxins have overall similar structures . The N - terminal domain of neuronal syntaxin 1 and its yeast plasma membrane homologue Sso1p consists of a three - helix bundle which interacts with its own SNARE motif resulting into closed conformation and can down regulate the capability to form SNARE complexes ( Dulubova et al . , 1999 ; Munson et al . , 2000 ) . But when the N - terminal domain of Sso1p was removed , formation of the SNARE complex assembly was accelerated ( Nicholson et al . , 1998 ) . The SNAREs classified in the group of Qb and Qc are more divergent , and only few structures are known . Vti1p is a Qb SNARE and the function of the N - terminal domain is completely unknown . The identification of structurally related regions in Tlg1p and Vti1p argue that the N - terminal regions of these nonsyntaxin SNAREs are likely to mediate equal inhibitory intramolecular interactions that regulate fusion . The N - terminus of vti1b forms 3 - helix bundles resembling syntaxin1 , Sso1p and Vam3p but do not bind with the SNARE motif and has no influence on the assembly kinetics ( Antonin et al . , 2002a ) . In vitro liposome fusion assays of N - terminal truncated Pep12p / Tlg1p and Vti1p ( 111 - 216 ) with all of the potential v - SNAREs in yeast showed that the specificity of fusion is fully conserved in the absence of any of the N - terminal domains ( Paumet et al . , 2004 ) . The removal of the N - terminal domains of Vti1p ( 1 - 118 ) and Tlg1p increases the fusion kinetics of the early endocytic / TGN complex and late endocytic complex in , in vitro liposome fusion assays ( Paumet et al . , 2005 ) . In this study , vti1Q29RW79R , a mutant having two amino acid replacements in the amino terminal region ( 2 AA mutant ) has been employed to study the function of the N - terminus of Vti1p . Vti1p has high content of α - helices , 82 . 95 % determined by PROF predictions of secondary structure of 120 4 Discussion proteins . In vtiQ29RW79Rp , the predicted α - helix content is 83 . 4 % , the increase in the α - helix content is provided by the replacement of tryptophan at 79 with arginine which also created a phosphorylation site for cAMP - and cGMP - dependent protein kinase in the mutant Vti1p . vti1Q29RW79R is not a dominant negative mutation indicating that it does not sequester binding partners which are rate limiting . A portion of the slightly overexpressed vti1Q29RW79Rp is localized to the ER . The fraction of ER localized vti1Q29RW79Rp increased upon shift to 37°C . The 1AA mutants , vti1Q29Rp and vti1W79Rp are partially localized to the vacuole whereas the genomically integrated 2 AA mutant did not show a strong ER localization . But , when Vti1p - HA was slightly overexpressed , it did not localize to the ER . This gives a hint that the N - terminal domain might contain some signal for the localization of Vti1p . The N - terminal extension of VAMP - 4 contains a target signal for the TGN ( Zeng et al . , 2003 ) . The N - terminal ( longin ) domain of rat Ykt6 is required for its sub - cellular particle localization ( Hasegawa et al . , 2003 ) . The longin domain of the Vamp7p from Arabidopsis thaliana is necessary for its vacuolar and sub - cellular targeting ( Uemura et al . , 2005 ) . However , further studies on the localization of the N - terminal truncations ( which was difficult to analyze since the antiserum against Vti1p did not recognize the truncated versions ) should give clear view of the role played by N - terminus in the localization of Vti1p . On the other hand , the stability of the proteins could give an indirect idea about their localization . The Vti1p is very stable and degraded by the vacuolar proteases whereas vtiQ29RW79Rp is highly unstable and requires polyubiquitination for its degradation . The N - terminus of the Vti1p might be responsible for the protein conformation or binding of the N - terminus with some stabilizing factor might have been disrupted , leading to instability of the mutant Vti1p . The N - terminal domain of Ykt6 forms a folded back conformation which is important for the stability of the protein ( Tochio et al . , 2001 ) . The reason for the ER localization of CEN 2 AA mutant but not genomically integrated mutation , could be because of the slow exit kinetics of CEN 2AA mutant or there might be too much protein for the slow residual pathway . In other case , the degradation kinetics of the 2 AA mutant might have an effect on the localization . The N - terminus of Vti1p might have signals for its localization and is required for the stability and proper degradation of Vti1p . 4 Discussion 121 The defect in the maturation of CPY but not ALP in vti1Q29RW79R cells demonstrates that the N - terminus of Vti1p is important for its function only in the traffic from the TGN to the prevacuole . Vti1p might interact with some regulatory proteins in the traffic from the TGN to the vacuole , which could be disturbed in the mutants , but this additional protein may not be needed in the ALP pathway . A comparable situation was found in vacuolar fusion , it was shown that the deletion of the N - terminal domain of Vam3p resulted in significantly less vacuolar fusion because the N - terminus was required to recruit the HOPS complex ( an essential docking factor ) and for coordinated docking ( Laage and Ungermann , 2001 ) . Since the N - terminal mutant Vti1p shows defects only in the CPY pathway , it again supports the fact that participation of additional proteins in vesicular targeting is necessary to provide the specificity for SNARE function and SNAREs do not have innate specificity ( Dilcher et al . , 2001 ; Fischer von Mollard et al . , 1997 ; Lazar et al . , 1997 ; Lupashin et al . , 1997 ) . The onset of the CPY sorting defect in vti1Q29RW79R cells is immediate upon shift to restrictive temperature . CPY transport to the vacuole is almost completely blocked in 10 min after shift to the restrictive temperature . Misfolding or mistargeting as fast mechanisms lower affinity with interaction partners . The half life of the mutant protein is longer than 2 h at 37°C . This indicates that the CPY transport defect and the instability of vti1Q29RW79Rp are two different autonomous effects . Thus , the N - terminus of Vti1p may play multiple roles . 4 . 2 Interaction of ENTH domain with SNARE proteins A full length ENTH domain protein called as enthoprotin or CLINT or epsinR ( Hirst et al . , 2003 ; Kalthoff et al . , 2002 ; Mills et al . , 2003 ; Wasiak et al . , 2002 ) emerged as a potential interaction partner for vti1b . The N - terminus of vti1b interacted with ENTH domain of epsinR and also the interaction was specific that vti1b did not interact with other ENTH domains . So far , only two proteins binding to ENTH domains have been identified . The transcription factor PLZF interacts with ENTH domain of Epsin1 which is present in the nucleus as an additional pool ( Hyman et al . , 2000 ) . The cytoskeletal protein tubulin interacts with ENTH ( epsin1 and epsinR ) and ANTH ( AP180 , HIP1 and Hip1R ) domains ( Hussain et al . , 2003 ) . 122 4 Discussion 4 . 2 . 1 Ent3p is a yeast ortholog of epsinR The further investigation showed that this interaction between a SNARE and an ENTH domain was conserved between mammals and yeast . The N - terminus of Vti1p interacted only with the ENTH domain of Ent3p among eight A / ENTH domain proteins in yeast . The following points indicate that Ent3p could be the yeast homolog of epsinR . The BLAST searches of yeast protein sequences with ENTH domain of epsinR predicted that Ent3p is more related to it and only Ent3p shares sequence homologies with epsinR that extend even beyond the ENTH domain . Also , both proteins interact with AP - 1 and the TGN adaptor proteins of the GGA family and colocalize with the clathrin - coated vesicles in the Golgi area and play a role in clathrin coated vesicle formation at the TGN or the endosomes ( Duncan et al . , 2003 ; Hirst et al . , 2003 ; Kalthoff et al . , 2002 ; Mills et al . , 2003 ; Wasiak et al . , 2002 ) . ENTH domain of Ent3p is required for its membrane localization ( Friant et al . , 2003 ) like that of epsinR ( Hirst et al . , 2003 ) . By liposome binding assay , I could demonstrate that Ent3p specifically binds PI3P and PI3 , 5P 2 which are regulators of the traffic from TGN to endosome and multivesicular body formation , respectively ( Simonsen et al . , 2001 ) . But , Friant et al . , showed that Ent3p binds only with PI3 , 5P 2 which could be because of the differences in the fusion protein . I used C - terminal Strep tagged ENTH domain which is better than the N - terminal GST tagged ENTH domain used by Friant group . The GST tag is large and since the tag is in the N - terminus , it might have blocked some binding sites in ENTH domain . The ENTH domain of epsinR interacted strongly with PI4P ( Hirst et al . , 2003 ; Kalthoff et al . , 2002 ; Mills et al . , 2003 ) . But both PI3P and PI4P are present in the Golgi complex ( De Matteis et al . , 2002 ) which may substitute for each other to recruit Ent3p or epsinR to the same organelle . This difference in the phosphoinositide binding was predicted by the structural modeling of tertiary structure of the ENTH domains of Ent3p and epsinR with epsin1 ENTH . It showed that the phosphoinositide binding pocket of epsinR and Ent3p is different between each other ( Duncan and Payne , 2003 ) . From my study , it has been shown that Ent3p and Vti1p are involved in the TGN to endosome trafficking in yeast ( Chidambaram et al . , 2004 ) . It is unclear in mammalian cells which SNAREs are involved in this pathway . The binding of vti1b with epsinR specifies that vti1b might be required for this route , supported by the finding that GGAs function in TGN to endosome traffic in mammalian cells ( Hinners and Tooze , 2003 ) with which epsinR interacts . The deletion of 4 Discussion 123 ent3 in other mutant combinations leads to distorted vacuolar transport pathways , ( Chidambaram et al . , 2004 ; Duncan and Payne , 2003 ) parallel to the Cathepsin D processing phenotype observed in epsinR overexpressing mammalian cells ( Mills et al . , 2003 ) . 4 . 2 . 2 Role of Ent proteins in the TGN - endosome trafficking The overexpression of the C - terminus of the ENTH domain protein Epsin1 has a dominant negative effect on endocytosis in mammalian cells ( Itoh et al . , 2001 ) . But overexpression of neither C - terminus of Ent3p nor the full length Ent3p demonstrated dominant negative effect in yeast cells . The defect in the CPY transport in ent3 ∆ , ent3 ∆ ent4 ∆ and especially the synthetic defect in ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells showed that Ent3p is involved in CPY traffic and Ent3p and Ent5p are redundant proteins in this pathway . 83 % of CPY reached the vacuole even in ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells indicating that other proteins can almost compensate for their loss . The synthetic defect of ENT3 in vti1 - 1 cells and of vti1 - 2 cells demonstrates that VTI1 and ENT3 function together in TGN to endosome trafficking . This is in accord with the interaction between Gga2p and Ent3p ( Black and Pelham , 2000 ) and the requirement for GGA proteins in traffic from the TGN to the prevacuole ( Costaguta et al . , 2001 ) . Absence of Ent3p in vti1Q29RW79R cells also shows a synthetic defect in CPY pathway . ALP pathway is not affected in the single ent mutants but ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells showed a marginal delay in ALP transport ( Duncan et al . , 2003 ) . Slightly less mature ALP was found in the absence of Ent5p but not of Ent3p in vti1 - 2 cells . vti1 - 2ent3 ∆ and vti1 - 2ent5 ∆ cells displayed a synthetic growth defect at 37°C . Temperature sensitive growth defects have been observed in the absence of proteins involved in different post Golgi transport steps . The synthetic defect in the CPY pathway may be the reason for the synthetic growth defect of vti1 - 2ent3 ∆ cells . In vti1 - 2ent5 ∆ , the synthetic growth defect might be due to a small synthetic defect in the ALP pathway . ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells secrete α - factor precursor ( Duncan et al . , 2003 ) . This processing of α - factor precursor requires Kex2p in the TGN which might be lost in ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells . The Kex2p recycles between the TGN and endosomes and the retrograde traffic to the TGN may be defective in ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells . Hence it is likely that Ent5p might be required for the retrograde traffic to the TGN . This may be another reason for the growth defect in vti1 - 2ent5 ∆ cells . Recent study support this speculation by showing that epsinR is 124 4 Discussion involved in the retrograde transport of exogenous Shiga toxin and two endogenous proteins TGN38 / 46 and mannose 6 - phosphate receptors from early endosomes to the TGN ( Saint - Pol et al . , 2004 ) . In contrary to this , the retrograde transport of A - ALP and Vps10p is not affected in ent3 ∆ , ent5 ∆ and ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells , stating that Ent proteins are not involved in the retrograde transport of at least these proteins in yeast . But still Ent5p might have cargo specificity for retrograde transport which has not been analyzed thoroughly or maybe Ent5p is involved in an unidentified pathway . In addition to epsinR , there are a number of alternative adaptors on the AP - 1 pathway whose role should be explored , like the γ ear binding partners γ - synergin , p200 and aftiphilin which all form a complex and facilitate AP - 1 function but additional roles await further investigation ( Hirst et al . , 2005 ) . The same is true for the yeast AP - 1 pathway adaptors Ent3p and especially Ent5p . Though Ent3p and Ent5p are redundant , different synthetic transport defects in vti1 mutant backgrounds indicate that Ent3p and Ent5p have slightly different functions . The function of epsinR might be apportioned between Ent3p and Ent5p . 4 . 2 . 3 Consequences of the interaction between ENTH domains and SNAREs The interaction between the ENTH domains of Ent3p / epsinR and SNAREs Vti1p / vti1b may be required for the sorting and recruitment of the SNAREs into budding vesicles . I could not substantiate this hypothesis by co - immunoprecipitating Ent3p with Vti1p or epsinR with vti1b , even after overexpressing the proteins . But it is common that interactions between adaptor proteins and cargo are often of low affinity and have to be very dynamic because the complexes have to dissociate after vesicle formation . Consequently , the binding between adaptor protein complexes and membrane receptors are hardly ever demonstrable by co - immunoprecipitations and have been studied almost exclusively using in vitro binding and yeast two - hybrid assays ( Bonifacino and Dell ' Angelica , 1999 ) . An analogous adaptor - cargo interaction of UNC - 11 , a homolog of the ANTH protein AP180 , with R - SNARE synaptobrevin was required for proper localization of synaptobrevin in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Nonet et al . , 1999 ) . UNC - 11 may directly recruit synaptobrevin into clathrin coated vesicles during endocytosis . It has been shown that SNAREs bind other components of the budding machinery like COPII coat proteins in ER to Golgi transport ( Springer and Schekman , 1998 ) and adaptor 4 Discussion 125 complexes which couple cargo selection to clathrin recruitment . The mammalian R - SNARE VAMP - 4 interacts with AP - 1 at the TGN ( Peden et al . , 2001 ) . In yeast , the vacuolar syntaxin Vam3p binds AP - 3 in transport from the TGN to the vacuole ( Darsow et al . , 1998 ) . A complex of mammalian AP - 3 and synaptobrevin mediates formation of synaptic vesicles from endosomes ( Salem et al . , 1998 ) indicating that incorporation of a SNARE can regulate vesicle budding . In ENTH proteins only the ubiquitin interaction motif has been implicated in cargo binding ( Polo et al . , 2002 ; Shih et al . , 2002 ) . This UIM motif is located outside of the ENTH domain in epsin family proteins and is absent from epsinR and Ent3p . From our data , we suggested that cargo sorting may be a novel function of the ENTH domain ( Chidambaram et al . , 2004 ) . The findings are summarized in the Fig . 48 . Recently , our hypothesis has been endorsed by the finding that epsinR is a cargo specific adaptor for vti1b ( Hirst et al . , 2004 ) . Less vti1b was recruited into the clathrin coated vesicles isolated from epsinR ( siRNA treated ) depleted cells whereas vti1a recruitment was unaffected . The depletion of epsinR caused redistribution of vti1b from the Golgi region to the cell periphery . Given the role of epsinR in the retrograde transport , it was proposed that epsinR might be required for the recycling of vti1b . But in my study , an alteration of the localization of Vti1p was not observed in the absence of Ent3p or Ent5p and the vice versa . In fact , it is certainly difficult to assess a small change in the distribution of Vti1p . In yeast , Golgi , TGN , early and late endosomal structures cannot be distinguished by their morphology . Vti1p is localized to all of these compartments . Vti1p uses the retrograde transport to achieve its proper steady - state localization . Loss of Pep12p should alter the localization of Vti1p but it could not be shown clearly because of the diffuse and punctuate localization of Vti1p ( Gerrard et al . , 2000a ) . Ent3p and Ent5p are shown to be important for ubiquitin dependent protein sorting into multivesicular body along with Vps27p ( Eugster et al . , 2004 ) . This shows that Ent3p and Ent5p could do two different functions like transport from the TGN to the endosomes and sorting in the MVB . 126 4 Discussion early late TGN Endosome Vacuole Anterograde Transport Ent5p Retrograde Transport Fig . 48 . The ENTH domain of Ent3p and the N - terminus of Vti1p interact in the anterograde transport from the TGN to the late endosome . Ent5p may play a role in the retrograde transport from the endosome to the TGN . 4 . 2 . 4 Characterization of ent mutants Subcellular fractionation and fluorescence microscopy studies in wt cells showed that Ent3p is a cytosolic protein with barely detectable association with small membrane structures and Ent5p is cytosolic with localization to punctuate structures , which was observed also by other groups ( Eugster et al . , 2004 ; Friant et al . , 2003 ) . The subcellular fractionation experiment underestimates the membrane pool and may dissociate during procedure . Interestingly , the membrane associated Ent5p was found predominantly in P200 while Ent3p was more prominent in P13 even though both proteins were largely cytosolic , indicating that Ent3p and Ent5p are localized to different compartments . The localization of Ent3p and Ent5p was not affected in vti1 mutants . Vacuolar morphology and internalization of FM4 - 64 in ent3 ∆ , ent5 ∆ and ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells are not affected . But Eugster et al , observed fragmented vacuolar morphology in ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ ( Eugster et al . , 2004 ) . This dissimilarity might be because of different yeast strain background . The yeast cell wall consists of a complex structure of cross - linked chitin , β - ( 1 , 3 ) - d - glucan , β - ( 1 , 6 ) - d - glucan and mannoproteins . Chitin and β - ( 1 , 3 ) - d - glucan are synthesiszed by enzymatic complexes at the cell membrane and extruded into the 4 Discussion 127 periplasmic space , mannoproteins are synthesized along the yeast secretory pathway and the site of β - ( 1 , 6 ) - d - glucan synthesis is still unknown ( Raclavsky , 1998 ) . Among them , β - ( 1 , 3 ) - d - glucan is the main component responsible for the rigidity of yeast cells . β - ( 1 , 3 ) - d - glucan synthase ( GS ) is responsible for synthesizing a major structural component of cell wall having Fks1p / Fks2p as its subunits and Rho1p is required as an activator ( Douglas et al . , 1994 ; Drgonova et al . , 1996 ) . Chitin is mostly concentrated in the septal region although some is dispersed throughout the cell wall . Despite its small quantity , chitin is essential for yeast survival ( Shaw et al . , 1991 ) . The primary and secondary septa are formed by the deposition of chitin on a chitin ring at the basis of an emerging bud . The daughter and the mother cells are separated by the action of a chitinase that partially hydrolyzes the primary septum . The three chitin synthases , CSI , CSII and CSIII have been identified in yeast ( Cabib et al . , 1996 ; Cid et al . , 1995 ) . Chs3p is the main player to synthesis chitin at the septum . Chs3p is synthesized at ER and Chs7p is required for its exit out from ER ( Trilla et al . , 1997 ) . At the Golgi , Chs3p is associated with Chs5p ( Santos et al . , 1997 ) . Chs5p and Chs6p ( Ziman et al . , 1998 ) are necessary for its transfer to the vesicles ( chitosomes ) that will carry Chs3p to the plasma membrane ( Chuang and Schekman , 1996 ; Ziman et al . , 1998 ) . Chs3p may be retained in a ring like area at the base of an emerging bud with the putative activator Chs4p ( DeMarini et al . , 1997 ) . The major chitin synthase , Chs3p clearly recycles through the TGN . It has been well established that this protein is recovered from the cell surface and dwells in an endocytic compartment before being delivered to the bud neck at the appropriate stage of the cell cycle ( Chuang and Schekman , 1996 ; Ziman et al . , 1998 ) . The syntaxin SNARE , Tlg1p is necessary for the correct localization of Chs3p ( Holthuis et al . , 1998 ) . The ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells showed abnormal cell shapes with branched cell morphology . But this effect was restricted only to 12 . 8 % of cells at 30°C and 20 % of cells at 18°C . The abnormal cells have irregular chitin deposition and abnormal actin assembly , though nearly 80 % of the cells are normal . But , the ent3 - 1 ts mutant cells have an actin organization defect at the restrictive temperature and no defect at the permissive temperature ( Friant et al . , 2003 ) which could not be seen with ent3 ∆ . This indicates that the ent3 - 1 ts has a dominant negative defect . Since the SNARE Tlg1p is required for the transport of Chs3p , we suspected that Ent3p or Ent5p might interact with Tlg1p for the proper localization of Chs3p which might be distorted in the ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells and so the 128 4 Discussion septum might have not formed well , subsequently forming elongated and branched cell morphology . But no interaction was found in the two hybrid test between Ent3p and Ent5p with Tlg1p . Also , an effect on the localization of Chs3p was not observed in the mutants . This may be due to technical problems because the Chs3p - GFP localization was very heterogeneous . The β - ( 1 , 3 ) - d - glucan layer did not look different in the mutants stained with aniline blue . The defects in chitin and actin localization are interdependent . The actin cytoskeleton and polarity establishment proteins also participate in the organization of chitin in the cell wall . The mutants defective in actin display an altered pattern of chitin deposition in which chitin is present over the whole cell surface and is no longer restricted to the bud neck ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ) . There is a correlation between actin delocalization and altered chitin deposition in polarity and bud emergence mutants like cdc24 ( Sloat et al . , 1981 ) , cdc42 and cdc43 ( Adams et al . , 1990 ) . The heterogeneous aberration of cell shape in ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells may not be a direct effect of loss of Ent proteins . The general defect by ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ in the intracellular transport may lead to loss of some components necessary for the biosynthesis of cell wall . For example , it has been shown that the loss of phosphatidic acid phosphatases in yeast caused abnormal cell shapes , aggregation and abnormal phenotypes in cell growth ( Katagiri and Shinozaki , 1998 ) . But a very clear defect in the cell wall of ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells is revealed by its sensitivity to many cell wall perturbing agents like NaCl , SDS , calcofluor and zymolyase , demonstrating that the structure of the cell wall is altered . The combinations of ent3 ∆ are very sensitive to NaCl , SDS and calcofluor whereas ent5 ∆ is more resistant to zymolyase , indicating that Ent proteins may have different roles on assembly of the cell wall . Although , Ent proteins show an obvious link with the defects in the organization of the cell wall , these observations are more difficult to explain . 4 . 2 . 5 Ent3p is required for the anterograde transport of Pep12p and vti1 - 2p Apart from the interaction of Ent3p with Vti1p , it binds also with other endosomal Q - SNAREs Pep12p and Syn8p ( to the N - terminus ) which are present in the same SNARE complex . A two hybrid interaction was not observed between Ent3p and the R - SNARE Ykt6p in the complex . The N - terminus of Ykt6p is different from that of the other Q - SNAREs which explains for the absence of interaction . Crystal structure of the N - terminus of Ykt6p revealed five β - sheet strands , which are sandwiched by one α - helix on 4 Discussion 129 one side and two α - helices on the other side ( Tochio et al . , 2001 ) . These interactions with three SNAREs of the same complex are very remarkable , suggesting that Ent3p may interact with individual SNAREs to recruit them into the vesicles or may help them in tethering . Otherwise , it may interact with the self assembled SNARE complex to regulate the core complex formation . The N - terminal domains of SNARE proteins are likely to be involved in controlling the rate of the complex formation and fusion ( Antonin et al . , 2002a ; Dulubova et al . , 2001 ; Misura et al . , 2002 ; Tochio et al . , 2001 ) . In this respect , additional regulatory proteins may contribute to influence the effect of the N - terminal domains of SNAREs ( Paumet et al . , 2004 ) . The degree of co - immunoprecipitation between the endosomal SNAREs Pep12p and Vti1p is not altered in ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells . The localization of Pep12p is not changed in the ent mutants . The localization of Ent3p should be checked in pep12 ∆ cells . By contrast to synthetic defects in vti1 - 2ent5 ∆ cells , a genetic interaction between PEP12 and ENT5 was not observed . Similar to vti1 - 2ent3 ∆ cells ( Chidambaram et al . , 2004 ) , the pep12 ∆ ent3 ∆ and pep12 ∆ ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells show synthetic growth defect at 37°C , establishing the genetic interaction between ENT3 and PEP12 . In addition , these cells were sensitive to high salt , relating them to the cell wall defects . Intriguingly , Pep12p is stabilized in the absence of Ent3p . In the absence of Ent3p and Ent5p , the stabilization is moderate , may be because of the epistatic effect of Ent5p . Ent3p might be required for the forward transport of Pep12p from the TGN to the endosome . In the absence of Ent3p , the anterograde transport of Pep12p might be blocked and it may get accumulated in the TGN which causes the increased stability ( Fig . 49 ) . Ent3p TGN Endosome Anterograde Transport Pep12p Fig . 49 . Ent3p is required for the anterograde transport of Pep12p from the TGN to the endosome . 130 4 Discussion The same effect was observed for vti1 - 2p in the absence of Ent3p and in turn , vti1 - 2p was destabilized in the lack of Ent5p . This gives rise to a model that Ent3p may be important for the anterograde transport of vti1 - 2p and a block in this transport caused increased stability of vti1 - 2p by accumulating it in the TGN . When the retrograde transport of vti1 - 2p mediated by Ent5p is interrupted , it is destabilized by degradatative vacuolar proteases when it gets accumulated in the endosome . As the stability of Vti1p was not altered by the Ent proteins , this hypothesis could not be proved for Vti1p . In vti1 - 2 cells , general protein transport is impaired which might exert some secondary effects on the stability of vti1 - 2p . But still the stability and the instability of vti1 - 2p are very specific to the loss of Ent3p and Ent5p respectively . Unless there is some role played by the Ent proteins , this effect could not be so specific . It may be that it is a complex or combined effect and could not be observed only in the absence of Ent proteins , but needs to down regulate the function of Vti1p also . Ent3p and Ent5p are not essential for the transport of Vti1p . On the other hand , the Ent proteins may be involved in the transport of Vti1p but the loss can be compensated by other proteins . But in the case of vti1 - 2p , it may not be able to bind the compensatory proteins in the absence of Ent proteins . 4 . 2 . 6 Role of Ent proteins in processing of pApe1p The ent3 ∆ cells are defective in CVT pathway which accumulated more pro aminopeptidase I in the log phase whereas ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells show a rescue effect . Autophagy is not affected in ent mutants . It could be that the absence of Ent3p may prevent the fusion of Cvt vesicles with vacuoles through Vti1p . An indirect effect due to a delay or defect in vacuolar processing may also show a defect in the maturation of Ape1p . Some vps mutants are essentially wild type for Ape1p processing while others are strongly blocked showing a secondary effect ( Klionsky et al . , 1992 ; Scott and Klionsky , 1995 ) . One more possibility is that a putative lipase Cvt17 / Aut5p is essential for intravacuolar lysis of autophagic bodies . The transport of Aut5p from the TGN to the endosome could be affected in the ent3 ∆ cells . Aut5p is targeted via the multivesicular body pathway to intravacuolar MVB vesicles by ubiquitin independent manner ( Epple et al . , 2003 ) . Ent3p is required for the ubiquitin dependent internalization of cargo into MVB , though it could not interact directly with ubiquitin ( Friant et al . , 2003 ) . Ent3p might be required for the internalization of Aut5p to process the pApe1p inside the 4 Discussion 131 vacuole . Ape1p is recruited onto Cvt membrane and the Cvt vesicle is formed by homotypic membrane fusion which depends on the SNARE Tlg2p and Vps45p ( Abeliovich et al . , 1999 ) . Ent3p could be needed for this step . 4 . 3 Outlook The 2 AA mutations and the N - terminal truncations of Vti1p are helpful tools to study the function of N - terminus . Further studies should be done to find out whether the kinetics of assembly and the amounts of the SNARE complex are altered in vivo by the N - terminus of Vti1p and its mammalian homologs . It should be thoroughly investigated if the N - terminus contains some targeting signal . The ALP pathway in the truncations and their localization should be studied . It would be interesting to study if ERAD ( ER associated degradation ) machinery is involved in the degradation of vtiQ29RW79Rp . It would be exciting to study whether the ENTH domain binding to the phophoinositides or Vti1p is competitive , cooperative or independent of each other by BIACORE analysis . The budding pattern and the localization of Bud proteins in the ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells could be analyzed . It would be interesting to study the rescue factors for Ape1p processing in ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells . The presence of Ent3p on autophagosomes could be checked to show if the defect is a direct or a secondary effect . 5 Summary 133 5 Summary The main aim of the study was to elucidate the function and to find out the interaction partners of the N - terminus of Vti1p . Immunofluorescence studies localized the mutant Vti1p to the ER pointing out that the N - terminus might have some targeting signal . Pulse chase immunoprecipitations showed that the N - terminus was required for the function of Vti1p in the traffic from the TGN to the endosome and was essential for the stability of the protein as well . The mutant Vti1p was not degraded by the vacuolar proteases . Degradation of mutant Vti1p necessitates the addition of polyubiquitin whereas the wild type Vti1p was degraded by the vacuolar degradation pathway . All these data indicate that the N - terminus could play multiple roles in the targeting , stability and the function of Vti1p . A yeast two - hybrid screen was done to discover interaction partners of the N - terminus of vti1b . The N - terminus of vti1b interacted specifically with the ENTH domain of enthoprotin / CLINT / epsinR . Further analysis showed that this interaction between a SNARE and an ENTH domain was conserved between mammals and yeast . Yeast Vti1p interacted with the ENTH domain of Ent3p . The studies demonstrated that Ent3p could be the yeast homolog of epsinR . Liposome binding assays showed that the ENTH domain of Ent3p specifically binds with PI3P and PI3 , 5P 2 . Ent3p was involved in the CPY transport and was redundant with Ent5p . The Genetic interactions between VTI1 and ENT3 were investigated by pulse chase analyses . Synthetic defects suggested that Vti1p and Ent3p cooperate in transport from the TGN to the prevacuolar endosome . Subcellular localization and fluorescence studies showed that Ent3p was more cytosolic and less associated with small membranes and Ent5p was localized to the cytosol and to small membranes . The localization of Ent proteins were not affected in the vti1 mutants and vice versa . The overexpression of Ent3p did not show a dominant negative effect . About 20 % of the ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells showed abnormal cell shape , disturbed actin assembly and irregular distribution of chitin . A mislocalization of chitin synthase III was not observed . Staining of the β - ( 1 , 3 ) - glucan layer was also not altered in the mutants . The ent3 ∆ and ent5 ∆ mutants exhibited different cell wall defects demonstrating that Ent3p and Ent5p may have different role on the assembly of the cell wall . 134 5 Summary The study was extended to identify Pep12p and Syn8p as further SNARE partners of Ent3p . Synthetic growth defects demonstrated the genetic interaction between Ent3p and Pep12p . Studies on stability of Pep12p inferred that Ent3p is required for the anterograde transport of Pep12p from the TGN to the endosome . For the recycling of vti1 - 2p , Ent3p and Ent5p were required . The retrograde transport of Vps10p and A - ALP from the endosomes to the TGN was not affected in the ent deletions . Also the amount of Pep12p and Vti1p which could be coimmunoprecipitated in the ent3 ∆ ent5 ∆ cells was not altered . Further analysis showed that Ent3p may have a role in the CVT pathway . This study identified the first cytoplasmic protein binding to a specific ENTH domain .

Curriculum Vitae I was born on 10th June 1978 as the first child of Chidambaram Kuthalampillai and Thangamani Chidambaram in Dharmapuri , Tamil Nadu , India . From 1983 till 1988 , I had my elementary education in a Government school in Karimangalam , Dharmapuri , India . In 1988 , I joined a high school in Karimangalam and successfully completed in 1993 with a secondary school - leaving certificate . In 1993 , I started studying higher secondary in St . Annes Girl’s Higher Secondary School , Trichy , India and successfully compeleted in 1995 . During 1995 - 1998 , I studied Biochemistry in Annai Sandhya Women’s College , Krishnagiri affiliated to Madras University , India , to obtain my Bachelor’s degree . At Madurai Kamaraj University , I specialized my Master’s degree in Integrated Biology with a dissertation entitled ‘Diurnal variations in visual response from the retina of the bat Cynopterus sphinx 1791 ( vahl ) to white light pulses’ , during 1998 - 2000 . In 2001 , I obtained a Summer Research Fellowship from Indian Academy of Sciences and joined the department of Microbiology and Cell biology in Indian Institute of Sciences , Bangalore , India and carried out a project entitled ‘An unexpected absence of queuosine modification in the tRNAs of an E . coli B strain’ . In June 2002 , I had started my Ph .
