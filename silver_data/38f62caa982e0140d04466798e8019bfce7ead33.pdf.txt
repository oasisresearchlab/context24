However , ethi - cal issues prevent the study of human chimeras in the late embryonic stage of development . Primate embry - onic stem cells ( ESCs ) , which have similar pluripotency to human ESCs , are a good model for studying inter - species chimerism and organ generation . However , whether primate ESCs can be used in xenogenous grafts remains unclear . In this study , we evaluated the chimeric ability of cynomolgus monkey ( Macaca fasci - cularis ) ESCs ( cmESCs ) in pigs , which are excellent hosts because of their many similarities to humans . We report an optimized culture medium that enhanced the anti - apoptotic ability of cmESCs and improved the development of chimeric embryos , in which domesti - cated cmESCs ( D - ESCs ) injected into pig blastocysts differentiated into cells of all three germ layers . In addition , we obtained two neonatal interspecies chi - meras , in which we observed tissue - speci ﬁ c D - ESC differentiation . Taken together , the results demonstrate the capability of D - ESCs to integrate and differentiate into functional cells in a porcine model , with a chimeric ratio of 0 . 001 – 0 . 0001 in different neonate tissues . We believe this work will facilitate future developments in xenogeneic organogenesis , bringing us one step closer to producing tissue - speci ﬁ c functional cells and organs in a large animal model through interspecies blastocyst complementation . KEYWORDS embryonic stem cells , blastocyst complementation , cynomolgus monkey , pig , interspecies chimera , organ reconstruction INTRODUCTION Human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) have the ability to self - renew and generate a large variety of cell types , and may be capable of generating human organs in other mammals for future organ transplantation by xenogenesis ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) . Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of generating an entire organ by xenogenesis , using rodent PSC blastocyst complementation . Hiromitsu et al . used rat PSCs to complement pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 ( Pdx1 ) - de ﬁ cient murine blastocysts , and gen - erated an entire rat pancreas with normal physiological function inside a Pdx1 - null murine host ( Kobayashi et al . , 2010 ) . A similar study reconstituted a rat thymus in a nude mouse ( Isotani et al . , 2011 ) . However , xenogenesis is more complex in humans than in mice because hPSCs exist in a “ primed ” state ( Rossant , 2015 ) . Primed hPSCs , which show some similarities to mouse epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) ( Nichols and Smith , Rui Fu , Dawei Yu , Jilong Ren and Chongyang Li have contributed equally to this work . Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s13238 - 019 - 00676 - 8 ) contains sup - plementary material , which is available to authorized users . © The Author ( s ) 2019 Protein Cell 2020 , 11 ( 2 ) : 97 – 107 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s13238 - 019 - 00676 - 8 Protein & Cell P r o t e i n & C e ll 2009 ) , can participate in normal mouse development when transplanted into gastrula - stage embryos . Region - selective hPSCs in a primed state could also generate post - implan - tation interspecies chimeric embryos after grafting to the posterior epiblast of gastrula - stage mouse embryos ( Wu et al . , 2015 ) . Although primed hPSCs could not participate in normal mouse development when transplanted into preim - plantation embryos as naïve PSCs ( Mascetti and Pedersen , 2016 ) , inhibiting apoptosis was shown to enhance the chi - meric ability of primed hPSCs in mice ( Huang et al . , 2018 ; Wang et al . , 2018b ) . In addition , Kang et al . showed that primed PSCs from cynomolgus monkeys ( Macaca fascicu - laris ) could generate chimeras using optimal culture condi - tions ( Kang et al . , 2018 ) . Several recent studies have also reported the generation of naive PSCs , which showed higher ef ﬁ ciency in single - cell cloning and genome editing , and could be incorporated in the host when transplanted into preimplantation embryos ( Gafni et al . , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2015 ) . Moreover , an intermediate primed state , between the naïve and primed state , was proven to contribute to the generation of chimeras by blastocyst injection ( Tsukiyama and Ohinata , 2014 ) , and resulted in better developmental ability of a chimeric pig ( Wu et al . , 2017 ) . Presently , mouse models are primarily used as chimeric hosts . However , these models are not suitable for transla - tional chimeric research because of the marked differences in development ( i . e . , embryo size and gestational period ) between rodents and humans . Izpisua et al . pioneered chi - meric research in a large animal model , successfully incor - porating a xenogenous graft of hPSCs into pig blastocysts and con ﬁ rming hPSC survival in early stage porcine embryos ( Wu et al . , 2017 ) . However , ethical issues prevent the study of human chimeras in the late stage of embryonic development , and it is unknown whether human cells can contribute to the organs of chimeras . Primate PSCs , which have similar pluripotency to hPSCs , are a good model for studying interspecies chimerism and organ generation . In this study , we used cmESCs to explore the possibility of interspecies chimerism in the development of late embryonic stage pigs . By optimizing the medium in which the cmESCs and injected blastocysts were cultured , we observed an increase in the anti - apoptotic ability of cmESCs and in the extent of chimeric embryo development , resulting in the successful incorporation of xenogenous cmESC grafts into multiple tissues of the neonatal pigs . This work will enable developments in xenogeneic organogenesis towards producing tissue - speci ﬁ c functional cells and organs in large animal models via interspecies blastocyst complementation . RESULTS Chimeric competency of cmESCs in different pluripotent states To systematically evaluate the chimeric competency of cmESCs in pigs , we prepared cmESCs in three pluripotent states : primed ( P ) ( Thomson et al . , 1998 ) , intermediate ( FAC ) ( Tsukiyama and Ohinata , 2014 ; Wu et al . , 2017 ) , and naïve ( NHSM ) ( Gafni et al . , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2015 ) . Cells in all three states expressed the pluripotency factor POU class 5 homeobox 1 ( POU5F1 ) , differentiated into embryoid bod - ies in vitro and teratomas in vivo , which contained tissues derived from all three embryonic germ layers , and also showed the normal the karyotypes ( Fig . S1A – D ) . To deter - mine whether the cmESCs could be engrafted into the por - cine inner cell mass ( ICM ) , we injected 10 GFP - labeled cmESCs from each pluripotent state into porcine partheno - genetic ( PA ) blastocysts , followed by 48 h of culture in vitro , and then evaluated their chimeric contributions ( Fig . 1A ) . Three criteria were used to evaluate the chimeric contribu - tions of the cmESCs in porcine blastocysts : survival of cmESCs in the embryonic environment ( the percentage of GFP - positive embryos divided by the number of embryos ) , the ability and ef ﬁ ciency of cmESCs to incorporate into total blastocysts ( the number of anti - human nuclear antigen ( hNA ) antibody - positive cells divided by the number of cells ) , and their ability to incorporate into the ICM ( the number of anti - hNA antibody - positive cells among the Nanog home - obox ( NANOG ) - positive cells ) . There were no signi ﬁ cant differences in cmESC survival between the different states ( Fig . S1E and S1F ) . However , the average numbers of cmESCs integrated into each blastocyst in the intermediate state ( 27 . 2 ± 2 . 107 , P < 0 . 05 ) and naïve state ( 30 . 1 ± 3 . 585 , P < 0 . 05 ) were higher than in the primed state ( 16 . 4 ± 2 . 504 ) . Furthermore , the average number of cmESCs integrated into the ICM in the intermediate state ( 3 . 9 ± 0 . 458 ) was higher than in the primed states ( 1 . 5 ± 0 . 401 , P < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 1B – D ) . These results indicated that in vitro , cmESCs in the inter - mediate pluripotent state had better survival and ICM inte - gration ability in pigs compared with the other cell types . We next investigated whether cmESCs in the different states contributed to neonatal porcine development in vivo . In total , 1 , 203 blastocysts derived from chimeric embryos were transferred to surrogate sows after 24 h of in vitro culture . Surprisingly , no natal chimeras survived , regardless of the culture system ( Table S1 ) . We suspected that 24 h of in vitro culture resulted in fatal damage to embryonic development , especially among the in vitro embryos , whose quality may have been worse than that of embryos fertilized in vivo , making them more sensitive to external factors . Domesticated ESC medium positively affects both ESCs and embryos during chimeric generation Since in vitro culture of chimeric blastocysts appeared to have damaging effects on the embryos , we sought to improve the chimeric system . Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of anti - apoptotic genes signi ﬁ cantly improves the chimeric ability of human ESCs in mice . We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of apoptosis might enable the cmESCs to form interspecies chimeras 98 © The Author ( s ) 2019 P r o t e i n & C e ll RESEARCH ARTICLE Rui Fu et al . upon injection into porcine embryos . To test this , we used a doxycycline - inducible system for transient induction of the human anti - apoptotic gene BCL2 like 1 ( BCL2L1 ) ( Wang et al . , 2018b ) . The survival of cmESCs overexpressing BCL2L1 was improved compared with control cmESCs , and the average number of BCL2L1 - overexpressing cmESCs integrated into each blastocyst in vitro was higher as well ( Fig . S2A – C ) . However , we still did not obtain any neonatal chimeras from a total of 643 blastocysts transferred into surrogate sows ( Table S1 ) , indicating that other factors in ﬂ uenced interspecies chimera formation .

Chimeric pigs made with monkey embryonic stem cells RESEARCH ARTICLE © The Author ( s ) 2019 99 P r o t e i n & C e ll A comparison of the cell and embryo culture systems showed that the pH and osmotic pressure of the cell culture medium and embryonic medium ( EM ) differed ( data not shown ) . These differences may have reversed the chimeric process , leading to in vivo embryonic development failure after in vitro culture . Thus , we improved the cell culture medium to better resemble the EM , by mixing FAC medium ( FM ) with EM , and changing the FM : EM ratio from 3 : 1 to 1 : 1 ( Fig . 2A ) . We named this domestic medium ( DM ) , and ter - med cmESCs cultured in 1 : 1 FM : EM domesticated ESCs ( D - ESCs ) , which could be cultured for long periods . They exhibited normal ESC morphology ( Fig . 2B ) and the karyotypes ( Fig . S2D ) , expressed the pluripotency markers POU5F1 and SRY - box transcription factor 2 ( SOX2 ; Figs . 2C and S2E ) , and in vivo , differentiated into teratomas that contained tissues of all three embryonic germ layers ( Fig . S2F ) . Subsequently , we assessed the transcriptomes of primed cmESCs and D - ESCs using RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) . The results revealed no signi ﬁ cant differences in RNA expression between D - ESCs and cmESCs . Principal component analysis revealed that D - ESCs displayed the same clusters as cmESCs ( Fig . 2D ) . In addition , naïve markers , such as NANOG and PR / SET domain 14 ( PRDM14 ) , were expressed at higher levels in D - ESCs A B T UN E L / G F P cmESC 3 FM / 1 EM 2 FM / 1 EM 1 FM / 1 EM D - ESC b H e i gh t 0 . 0 0 . 4 M u sc l e - 1 M u sc l e - 2 D - ES C - 1 D - ES C - 2 c m ES C - 1 c m ES C - 2 M u sc l e - 1 M u sc l e - 2 D - ES C - 1 D - ES C - 2 c m ES C - 1 c m ES C - 2 MYF5 MYOD1 PRDM14 NANOG LIN28B DPPA4 ZFP42 SALL4 LIN28A SOX2 POU5F1 cmESC D - ESC 0 h 24 h 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 2 1 . 6 0 . 8 F G POU5F1 SOX2 C D E c m E S C c m E S C D - E S C D - E S C 0 h 24 h Merge Merge GFP TUNEL Merge GFP TUNEL Merge * Merge Bright GFP Figure 2 .

RESEARCH ARTICLE Rui Fu et al . 100 © The Author ( s ) 2019 P r o t e i n & C e ll compared to cmESCs ( Fig . 2E ) . To examine the effects of the improved system on chimerism , we ﬁ rst evaluated the anti - apoptotic ability of D - ESCs , and observed enhanced anti - apoptotic ability during chimera development after the 24 - h co - culture phase compared with that of cmESCs cul - tured in FM ( Fig . 2F – G ) . We also evaluated the effects of DM on embryo development . The results revealed similar blas - tocyst and hatching rates in DM and EM , which were higher than in FM ( Table 1 ) . These results suggest that DM is favorable for both ESCs and embryos during chimera development . D - ESCs can generate interspecies chimeric embryos Next , we investigated the potential contribution of D - ESCs to post - implantation development following transfer to surro - gate sows . The embryo manipulation procedures performed are shown in Fig . 3A . In brief , porcine embryos derived through in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) or nuclear transfer ( NT ) were cultured in vitro to the blastocyst stage . Then , 10 – 15 D - ESCs were injected into each blastocyst , and embryos were collected 25 – 30 days later for further analysis . Of 4 , 359 blastocysts transplanted , 59 embryos were obtained , of which three were chimeric . These chimeric embryos col - lected between 25 – 30 days were veri ﬁ ed by a sensitive genomic polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay using monkey - speci ﬁ c sequence primers ( Fig . 3B ) . Compared to wild - type ( WT ) embryos , obvious green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP ) expression was observed in the fetus 5 ( F5 ) sample . We veri ﬁ ed the GFP - positivity of F5 by immuno ﬂ uorescence ( IF ) analysis ( Fig . 3C ) . To determine how D - ESCs were involved in germ layer differentiation , we costained for GFP and various lineage markers . Subsets of GFP - positive cells expressed the endoderm marker forkhead box A2 ( FOXA2 ) , mesoderm marker T - box transcription factor 6 ( TBX6 ) , and ectoderm marker SRY - box transcription factor 1 ( SOX1 ) , suggesting that the D - ESCs could differentiate into all three germ layers ( Fig . 3D ) . D - ESCs can generate interspecies chimeric neonatal pigs To evaluate long - term integration , three pregnancies were continued until birth . One of these was spontaneously aborted , in two other pregnancies , 10 pups were born but all died within 1 week . Multiple tissues and organs were col - lected from neonatal pigs and analyzed for the presence of cynomolgus monkey cells . Two of the pups were chimeras , con ﬁ rmed by PCR using a monkey - speci ﬁ c sequence primer ( Fig . S3A ) . GFP - positive cynomolgus monkey cells con - tributed to multiple tissues , including the heart , liver , spleen , lung , and skin , but not to others , including the testis and ovaries , due to low chimerism in the postnatal pigs ( Figs . 4A and S3B ) . To further con ﬁ rm the fates of the D - ESCs in the neonatal pigs , we co - stained for GFP and tissue - speci ﬁ c markers . Subsets of GFP - positive cells expressed liver and kidney tissue - speci ﬁ c markers , suggesting that these mon - key cells were not in a pluripotent state but had differentiated into hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha ( HNF4A ) - positive liver cells and spalt like transcription factor 1 ( SALL1 ) - positive kidney cells , respectively ( Fig . 4B ) . Through mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) detection , we found that the chimeric ratio in different tissues ranged from 0 . 001 – 0 . 0001 ( Fig . 4C ) . All data regarding chimeric development with IVF embryos in vivo are shown in Table 2 . Taken together , these results demonstrated that D - ESCs contributed to all three germ layers and various tissues in the embryonic and neonatal phases , indicating successful interspecies chimerism between cynomolgus monkeys and pigs . DISCUSSION In this study , we injected D - ESCs into porcine blastocysts to obtain neonatal interspecies chimeras . The D - ESCs differ - entiated into all three germ layers in the pig fetuses , con - sistent with a previous study reporting human / pig chimeras ( Wu et al . , 2017 ) . The human / pig fetuses survived only 28 day , and it was not possible to observe whether the chimeric human ESCs could develop into mature functional cells in pigs for ethical issues . In this study , we con ﬁ rmed that monkey / pig chimeras can form functional hepatocytes and renal cells in neonatal pigs . These functional cells could be isolated for further research and future clinical application . Interspecies chimerism has been most successful in rodents , and these studies typically achieve a high propor - tion of chimerism and generate xenogeneic organs ( Kobayashi et al . , 2010 ; Isotani et al . , 2011 ) . The pluripo - tency levels of rodent PSCs are the highest known , as they are genuine naïve cells , and they can produce live offspring by tetraploid complementation , which is the most stringent Table 1 .

Recent studies on xenogeneic chimerism in mice and rats showed that the pluripotency of rat ESCs affected kidney organ reconstruction in mice ( Goto et al . , 2019 ) , demonstrating that the pluripotency of the donor cells in ﬂ uenced xenogeneic chimerism . Primate ESCs exist in a different phase of pluripotency than rodent ESCs , as they are primed rather than naïve ( Brons et al . , 2007 ; Nichols and Smith , 2009 ; NT embryo IVF embryo D - ESCs Cell fusion & activation M bp 500 200 300 FOXA2 TBX6 SOX1 FOXA2 TBX6 SOX1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 P CM NC Mix ( F ) CSF Mit Sox2 A B C D E ndode r m M e s ode r m E c t ode r m Merge Merge Merge Blastocyst WT F5 D25 – 30 fetus Piglet Chimeric embryo F5 / F5 / GFP GFP GFP GFP DAPI GFP GFP Figure 3 .

The ratio of cmESCs in allogenic chimeras is only 0 . 1 % – 4 . 5 % ( Chen et al . , 2015 ; Kang et al . , 2018 ) , which is signi ﬁ cantly lower than with rodents . How - ever , in previous reports , naïve hPSCs have lacked the competency to integrate into the mouse embryo ( Gafni et al . , 2013 ; Theunissen et al . , 2014 ) . In our study , chimeras were not obtained when the PSCs were transferred into naïve state or with overexpression of an anti - apoptotic gene . In agreement with Wu et al . , we found that the PSCs cultured in the FAC condition showed a better chimeric contribution in vitro , and were more likely to generate normal individuals in the chimeric processes ( Wu et al . , 2017 ) . Overall inter - species chimerism is complex , and in addition to the pluripotency of donor cells , its success involves several other aspects that facilitate interactions between the trans - planted cells and recipient embryos . In our domestication system , the cell and embryo culture media were mixed in an optimal ratio , increasing the anti - apoptotic ability of cmESCs and improving the development of pig embryos , and allowing the successful generation of chimeric animals . Improvement of the culture conditions also played an important role in a previous homozygous chimera study ( Kang et al . , 2018 ) . The proportion of chimerism in our study was 10 – 100 times higher than in the previously reported human / pig chimera ( Wu et al . , 2017 ) . Therefore , optimizing the chimeric system is an effective method to increase the chimerism ratio . Interspecies chimerism still has a long way to go before clinical application is possible . One obstacle is the need to increase the ef ﬁ ciency of homozygous chimerism by improving the pluripotency of cmESCs . There have been many studies addressing the acquisition of pluripotent and totipotent stem cells ( Yang et al . , 2017 ; Wang et al . , 2018a ) . Second , information is needed regarding the molecular mechanisms underpinning the evolutionary differences that affect the ef ﬁ ciency of xenogeneic chimera development . Previous studies have reported successful chimeras con - taining human tissue cells , demonstrated by liver ( Azuma et al . , 2007 ) , neural stem cell ( Cohen et al . , 2016 ) , and hematopoietic immune system ( Goyama et al . , 2015 ) humanization , indicating that there is no obstacle to the remodeling of xenogeneic organs in human / mouse and human / pig chimeras . Here , we have used monkey cells to explore the potential of reconstructing chimeric human organs in a large animal model . We believe this work will facilitate the development of xenogeneic organogenesis by providing a better understanding of the processes of xeno - geneic recognition , fate determination , and the proliferation and differentiation of primate stem cells during porcine development . The ﬁ ndings could pave the way toward overcoming the obstacles in the re - engineering of hetero - geneous organs and achieve the ultimate goal of human organ reconstruction in a large animal . MATERIAL AND METHODS Ethical approval All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines of the Institute of Zoology , Chinese Academy of Sciences . The cross - species chimeric experiments were reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the Institute of Zoology , Chi - nese Academy of Sciences . Cell culture The cmESCs were a gift from Prof . Li , which were established as described previously ( Chen et al . , 2015 ) . In brief , primed cmESCs were digested into clusters using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , reseeded on feeder cells in primed medium ( PM ) , and infected with simian immunode ﬁ ciency virus , harboring the sequence encoding EGFP driven by a cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) - en - hanced chicken β - actin ( CAG ) promoter ( Niu et al . , 2010 ) . After two passages , cmESCs sorted by ﬂ uorescence - activated cell sorting ( FCAS ) were detached using Accutase ( Gibco , A11105 - 1 ) to obtain single cells , which were transferred to NHSM and FAC medium to generate naïve and intermediate cmESCs , respectively . Dome - shaped colonies were selected and transferred onto fresh feeder cells for further ampli ﬁ cation . The D - ESCs were derived from cmESCs cultured in FM by mixing the FM with EM at a 1 : 1 ratio . Table S2 provides details about the culture media used . Pluripotency analysis in an in vivo teratoma assay To induce teratoma formation , 1 × 10 6 ESCs were subcutaneously injected into mice with severe combined immune de ﬁ ciency . Ter - atomas were collected after approximately 4 week and ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for paraf ﬁ n embedding and hematoxylin and eosin staining according to standard procedures . Embryo micromanipulation and chimera assays Procedures for porcine oocyte collection , in vitro maturation , IVF , PA production , somatic cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT ) , and embryo cul - ture were conducted as previously reported ( Whitworth et al . , 2014 ; Yuan et al . , 2017 ) . In brief , porcine ovaries were collected from a local slaughterhouse and transported to the laboratory within 1 h in normal saline at 37 °C . Oocytes were collected by aspiration and cultured for 42 – 44 h in vitro . Cumulus cells were then removed using 0 . 1 % hyaluronidase , and matured oocytes at the MII stage were selected for IVF , PA , and SCNT . The embryos were cultured in porcine zygote medium in 5 % carbon dioxide at 38 . 5 °C . In the in vitro experiment , 10 GFP - labeled ESCs were injected into porcine PA blastocysts collected 5 day after activation , followed by 48 h of culture . In the ﬁ rst 4 h , the injected embryos were cultured in ESC medium and then transferred to mixed ESC medium and EM at a 1 : 1 ratio for another 20 h , followed by culture in EM for the ﬁ nal 24 h . Porcine PA blastocysts were then collected for immuno ﬂ uorescence analysis . In the in vivo experiment , 10 – 15 GFP - labeled ESCs were injected into IVF or NT blastocysts . After 24 h of in vitro culture , the RESEARCH ARTICLE Rui Fu et al . 104 © The Author ( s ) 2019 P r o t e i n & C e ll injected embryos were transferred into recipient surrogates 5 day after estrus onset . Pregnancy was diagnosed by transabdominal ultrasonography using B - ultrasound ( Model LX8000 , Kangkaijie Instruments , China ) 25 – 30 day later and con ﬁ rmed every 2 week . Piglets were delivered naturally 114 – 117 day later . Immuno ﬂ uorescence The samples of cells , embryos ( 25 – 30 day ) , and tissue from neonatal pigs were ﬁ xed for 30 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ; 0 . 01 mol / L , pH 7 . 4 ) at room tem - perature ( RT ) and permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 30 min at RT . The samples were then blocked in 1 % bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at RT after three 5 min washes in washing solution ( 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , 0 . 01 % Triton X - 100 in PBS ) , followed by incubation with primary antibodies ( Table S3 ) overnight at 4 °C . After three 5 min washes in washing solution , cells or embryos were incubated with Alexa Fluor series ﬂ uorescent tag - conjugated sec - ondary antibodies diluted in washing solution for 1 h at RT . After three washes with washing solution , nuclei were stained with 4 ’ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ; 10 mg / mL in PBS ) for 10 min . Immediately after three washes with washing solution , cells or embryos in microdroplets in a dish were imaged using a laser scanning inverted confocal microscope ( LSM 780 , Zeiss ) . Genomic PCR Genomic PCR was performed to detect monkey cells in the porcine fetuses and tissues from neonatal pigs . The genomic DNA of pig fetuses was extracted from the formalin - ﬁ xed , paraf ﬁ n - embedded ( FFPE ) slices using TIANamp Micro DNA Kit ( TIANGEN , DP316 ) . The genomic DNA of tissue from neonatal pigs was extracted using TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit ( TIANGEN , DP304 ) . PCR was per - formed using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase ( Takara , R051A ) followed by Sanger sequencing . Primer sequences used for PCR are provided in Table S4 . Quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) analysis of monkey mtDNA Analysis of monkey mtDNA was performed using SYBR Green Real - time PCR Master Mix ( Takara , RR430A ) on an Agilent Mx3005P qPCR system . Total DNA was isolated from porcine fetuses and neonatal porcine tissues . A monkey mtDNA control and a series of monkey - pig cell dilutions were run in parallel to estimate the degree of monkey cell contribution in interspecies chimeras . For normal - ization , an identical set of reactions was prepared using primers speci ﬁ c for an ultra - conserved non - coding element . Primer sequences used for genomic qPCR are listed in Table S4 . RNA - seq library preparation and data processing The cmESCs were cultured in PM , FM , and DM . Porcine PA blas - tocysts were collected 5 day after activation and cultured in PM , FM , and DM for 48 h . The cmESCs and porcine PA blastocysts were then collected for RNA - seq analysis . Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen , 15596026 ) . For RNA - seq library construction , PolyA + tailed RNA puri ﬁ cation was performed for each sample using an E . Z . N . A . MicroElute RNA Clean - Up Kit ( Omega Bio - tek ) . Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer with 150 - bp paired - end sequencing reactions . RNA - seq data on monkey muscle samples downloaded from the GEO database ( GSE102830 ) ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) were used as a control . All RNA - seq reads were mapped to the M . fasci - cularis genome assembly ( macFas5 ) using HISAT2 software ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) , using annotated gene structures as templates and default parameters . Reads with unique genome locations were reserved for gene expression calculations in Cuf ﬂ inks ( version 2 . 0 . 2 ) using the option “ – GTF ” . Heat maps and cluster analysis were produced using the heatmap . 2 and hcluster functions of R , respec - tively . The accession number for the RNA - seq expression values reported in this study is GSE . TUNEL assay TUNEL assays were performed as previously described ( Jachowicz et al . , 2017 ) . Embryos were collected 0 or 24 h after ESC injection and permeabilized in extraction buffer ( 50 mmol / L NaCl , 3 mmol / L MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , and 300 mmol / L sucrose in 25 mmol / L HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ) for 5 min on ice . Next , the embryos were washed twice in extraction buffer without Triton X - 100 and incubated with 1 U / mL of DNase I ( Ambion , AM2222 ) in the same buffer for 5 min at 37 °C . After ﬁ xation , TUNEL assays were performed using a Click - iT TUNEL Alexa Fluor Imaging Assay Kit ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Immuno ﬂ uorescence was per - formed as described above . Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Soft - ware ( GraphPad Prism 7 . 00 ) . Each experiment included at least three independent biological replicates . For statistical comparison , Student ’ s t - test and one - way analysis of variance were employed . All data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean ( SEM ) . * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 . Statistical parameters for speci ﬁ c experiments , including statistical analysis , statistical signi ﬁ cance , and n values , are reported in the ﬁ gure legends . ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Dr .
