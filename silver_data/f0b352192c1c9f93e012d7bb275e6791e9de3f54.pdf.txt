Piekny 1 and Michael Glotzer 1 , * 1 Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology University of Chicago Chicago , Illinois 60637 Summary Cell division after mitosis is mediated by ingression of an actomyosin - based contractile ring . The active , GTP - bound form of the small GTPase RhoA is a key regulator of contractile - ring formation . RhoA concen - trates at the equatorial cell cortex at the site of the nascent cleavage furrow . During cytokinesis , RhoA is activated by its RhoGEF , ECT2 . Once activated , RhoA promotes nucleation , elongation , and sliding of actin ﬁlaments through the coordinated activation of both formin proteins and myosin II motors ( reviewed in [ 1 , 2 ] ) . Anillin is a 124 kDa protein that is highly concentrated in the cleavage furrow in numer - ous animal cells in a pattern that resembles that of RhoA [ 3 – 7 ] . Although anillin contains conserved N - terminal actin and myosin binding domains and a PH domain at the C terminus , its mechanism of ac - tion during cytokinesis remains unclear . Here , we show that human anillin contains a conserved C - termi - nal domain that is essential for its function and locali - zation . This domain shares homology with the RhoA binding protein Rhotekin and directly interacts with RhoA . Further , anillin is required to maintain active myosin in the equatorial plane during cytokinesis , suggesting it functions as a scaffold protein to link RhoA with the ring components actin and myosin . Although furrows can form and initiate ingression in the absence of anillin , furrows cannot form in anillin - depleted cells in which the central spindle is also dis - rupted , revealing that anillin can also act at an early stage of cytokinesis . Results and Discussion Active RhoA and Anillin Modulate Each Other’s Localization In dividing HeLa cells , anillin concentrates at the equatorial cortex upon anaphase onset , where it coloc - alizes extensively with RhoA , a key regulator of furrow formation and ingression ( Movie S1 available online , Figure 1A ) . In human cells , RhoA accumulation at the equatorial cortex can be observed after ﬁxation with trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) [ 8 ] . Fluorescently tagged C . elegans RhoA becomes highly concentrated on the equatorial cortex during anaphase in living cells , provid - ing independent demonstration of a physiologically rele - vant cortical pool of RhoA [ 9 ] . Anillin - depleted cells initi - ate furrowing but undergo cortical oscillations and then furrow regression , suggesting that anillin promotes fur - row stabilization [ 6 , 7 ] . Although furrows ingress exten - sively , anillin depletion unexpectedly causes a dramatic decrease in the TCA - ﬁxable cortical pool of RhoA ( 17 / 17 cells ; Figure 1B ) [ 7 ] . Furthermore , prevention of oscilla - tions with the nonmuscle myosin inhibitor blebbistatin does not restore RhoA localization in anillin - depleted cells ( 31 / 31 cells ; Figure 1B ) . However , live imaging reveals that GFP : RhoA ( GFP : green ﬂuorescent protein ) localizes to the equatorial cortex in anillin - depleted cells ( Movie S2 ) . Conversely , anillin localization requires RhoA . RhoA - depleted cells contain trace levels of anillin at the equatorial region ( 17 / 17 cells ) ( Figure 1C ) . Anillin localization is also lost in cells depleted of the RhoA exchange factor ECT2 ( 23 / 23 cells ; Figure 1D ) [ 7 ] . Col - lectively , these data indicate that active RhoA is essen - tial for anillin localization and that anillin stabilizes RhoA for ﬁxation . The Anillin Homology Domain Is Essential for Function and Localization Anillin contains actin and myosin binding domains , an anillin homology domain ( AHD ) , named for its con - servation among metazoan anillins ( Figure S1 ) , and a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain [ 3 , 5 , 6 ] . To study the functions of these domains , we developed an RNA interference ( RNAi ) knockdown and transfection rescue assay in human cells . After 24 hr of small inter - fering RNA ( siRNA ) treatment , anillin - depleted cells show a penetrant phenotype ( 8 / 9 cells observed by live imaging undergo oscillations and fail to divide ) that is rescued by coexpression of RNAi - resistant GFP : anillin ( 13 / 13 cells were rescued ) . We conducted a functional domain analysis of anillin by assessing the fraction of binucleated , transfected cells ( n > 300 cells per construct , Figure 2A ) . In an asynchronous population of cells ﬁxed after 24 hr of RNAi treatment , 40 % – 50 % of cells are binucleate . Cotransfection of full - length anillin substantially rescues the percentage of binucleate cells and localizes like endogenous anillin ( construct A , Figures 2A and 2B ) . The nuclear localiza - tion signal ( NLS ) sequences are not required for cytoki - nesis , nor are they required for furrow localization ( construct B ; Figures 2A and 2B ) . However , the C termi - nal PH domain is required for robust furrow localization and for anillin function ( construct H ) . Constructs lack - ing either the myosin ( construct C ) or actin ( construct D ) domains are partially functional , but constructs lacking both ( constructs E and F ) are nonfunctional . However , these constructs localize discretely to an equatorial region that shifts minimally as the cell oscil - lates ( Figures 2A and 2B , Movie S1 ) . A construct lack - ing the conserved AHD ( construct J ) fails to rescue anillin depletion . The AHD is required for persistent equatorial localization during furrowing because con - struct J becomes localized in polar regions of the cell as it oscillates instead of remaining equatorial like constructs E and F ( Figures 2A and 2B , Movie S1 ) . * Correspondence : mglotzer @ uchicago . edu Construct I , which contains just the AHD , displays weak furrow localization , supporting its role in anillin localization ( Figures 2A and 2B , Movie S1 ) . All con - structs were assayed for their ability to restore RhoA localization in TCA - ﬁxed cells . Constructs A – G concen - trate at the furrow and fully stabilize RhoA for ﬁxation . Constructs H and I weakly accumulate at the furrow but nevertheless allow detection of RhoA . Notably , construct J , which lacks the AHD , fails to stabilize RhoA even though it initially concentrates at the furrow ( Figure 2C ) . Thus , the AHD mediates persistent furrow localization and stabilization of RhoA . Anillin Shares Homology with Rhotekin and Binds to RhoA Proﬁle - based searching revealed that the AHD is struc - turally related to Rhotekin ( Figure 3A and Figure S1 ) [ 10 ] . The region of similarity extends from Rhotekin’s RhoA - GTP binding domain to its PH domain ( Figure 3A ) . The AHD also has a short motif of high homology to the Rho binding region of Protein Kinase N ( PKN ) . Because Rhotekin and PKN selectively bind to active RhoA [ 11 , 12 ] , we determined whether anillin could bind to RhoA . To assess RhoA binding , we expressed GFP : RhoA by transient transfection . GFP : RhoA migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) gels as two distinct species . The AHD ( residues 608 – 943 ) binds to the faster migrating band of the doublet and less avidly to the slower migrat - ing species . The efﬁciency of binding to the faster mi - grating species is enhanced by the RhoA - activating mu - tation Q63L ( Figure 3B ) . The slower migrating species appears to be a modiﬁed form of RhoA . Overexpression of untagged RhoA also results in a fragment that mi - grates more slowly than endogenous RhoA , and a small fraction of endogenous RhoA also runs with this re - duced mobility ( Figure S2A ) . Furthermore , cleavage of GFP : RhoA at a protease site engineered between GFP and RhoA releases a species of RhoA that migrates more slowly than endogenous RhoA ( Figure S2B ) . The RhoA binding domain ( RBD ) from Rhotekin also prefer - entially binds the faster migrating form ( Figure S2C ) . To further address anillin’s nucleotide speciﬁcity , we performed pull - down experiments after preloading GFP : hsRhoA in lysates with either guanine diphosphate ( GDP ) or guanine triphosphate ( GTP ) ( Figure 3C ) . GFP : RhoA - loaded with GTP enhanced anillin binding as compared to GDP . To determine whether anillin can directly bind to RhoA , we performed in vitro assays with recombinant proteins . Indeed , hsRhoA - GTP di - rectly bound to anillin , although with lower afﬁnity than the RBDs from Rhotekin or mDia1 ( Figure 3D , Fig - ure S2D ) . To further analyze the relevance of the Rho binding region for anillin function , we mutated the conserved residues 837 DFEINIE 843 to AFAINIA . Full - length anillin with these substitutions ( Figure 2A , construct L ) fails to rescue the anillin phenotype , and neither the full - length nor a shorter construct with these mutations ( Figure 2A , construct K ) can efﬁciently stabilize RhoA during TCA ﬁxation ( Figure 3E ) . These mutations also reduce the ef - ﬁciency with which the C terminus of anillin ( 608 – 1087 ) pulls down GFP : RhoA ( Figure 3B ) . Mutation of another set of residues ( 800 KAGAEN 805 to AAGAAA ) , which are conserved in PKN and are part of a RhoA binding interface [ 12 ] , had no effect on anillin function or locali - zation ( data not shown ) , conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of the DFEINIE region . Unfortunately , the interaction of RhoA with Rhotekin has not been analyzed at the atomic level , precluding precise mutational analysis . Further - more , many RhoA effectors have several RhoA binding sites , which might act cooperatively [ 13 ] . Additional evidence for an in vivo interaction between anillin and RhoA is the ﬁnding that construct F , consisting of the AHD and PH domains , induces the formation of ectopic RhoA - containing foci in interphase cells ( 41 % of cells , n = 151 ; Figure S3 ) . These foci are less prominent in cells expressing an equivalent construct ( K ) with the alanine Figure 1 .

Scale bar for all mitotic cells represents 5 m m . Anillin and RhoA Associate at the Contractile Ring 31 substitutions described above ( 6 % of cells , n = 113 ; Figure S3 ) . Furthermore , these foci are ECT2 indepen - dent , unlike AHD localization during anaphase . Previous overexpression studies had also suggested that RhoA and anillin interact [ 14 ] . Collectively , these results indi - cate that anillin is structurally related to Rhotekin and can bind to RhoA , and we have mapped a domain criti - cal for anillin localization and function . Anillin Is Required to Maintain Myosin in the Contractile Ring To further investigate anillin’s cytokinetic role , we com - pared the localization of RhoA and myosin in the presence and absence of anillin . In control cells , RhoA , anillin , and myosin colocalize throughout cytokinesis . In anillin - depleted cells , live - cell imaging reveals furrow accumulation of GFP : RhoA ( Figure 4A ) . This accumula - tion of GFP : RhoA is consistent with the contractile behavior of anillin - depleted cells and suggests that anillin stabilizes RhoA during TCA ﬁxation . When these cells undergo oscillations , GFP : RhoA remains localized in the equatorial plane ( Figure 4A ) . The cytoplasmic con - tents move through this plane , and although RhoA shifts somewhat , it remains discretely localized . How - ever , myosin II exhibits entirely different dynamics , as visualized with GFP : mlc or the phosphomimetic form GFP : mlcE20E21 . Myosin is initially equatorial , but after furrow ingression begins , myosin localizes to the polar regions of the cell , moving in concert with the oscilla - tions ( Figure 4B ) . Inhibition of myosin activity with bleb - bistatin results in the immediate cessation of oscillations ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that anillin pro - motes the anchoring of myosin in the vicinity of RhoA . Immunolocalization of myosin in cells expressing vari - ous anillin constructs substantiate this conclusion . Although anillin constructs E and F colocalize with Figure 2 .

Cells of similar levels of expression were chosen for direct comparison . Anillin and RhoA Associate at the Contractile Ring 33 myosin in the equatorial plane , they do not colocalize when myosin concentrates in the polar regions ( Fig - ure S4 ) . Dual color time - lapse imaging reinforces this conclusion . Construct F ( containing the AHD domain ) and RhoA colocalize throughout furrowing . In contrast , construct F and myosin light chain colocalize equatori - ally , but not when myosin becomes enriched in the polar regions ( Movie S2 ) . In contrast , construct J , which lacks the AHD , colocalizes with myosin in the polar regions ( Figure S4 ) . Thus , anillin acts as a cytokinetic scaffold to link RhoA with the contractile - ring components actin and myosin . Depletion of anillin allows myosin to escape from the equatorial plane , where RhoA remains concen - trated . Myosin accumulates in polar regions of the cell , where it causes a contraction and induces expansion at the opposite pole . This mechanical stress might suf - ﬁce to induce myosin recruitment at the expanded pole , establishing cortical oscillations [ 15 – 17 ] . Anillin Is Required for Furrow Formation in the Absence of a Central Spindle Although anillin directly binds to three critical contrac - tile - ring components and is among the ﬁrst proteins to localize to the furrow upon anaphase onset , cytokinesis can progress to a remarkable extent or even complete in its absence [ 4 – 7 ] . Because parallel pathways regulate furrow formation in animal cells [ 18 , 19 ] , an early function for anillin could be obscured by functional redundancy . Therefore , we determined whether anillin contributes to furrow formation in cells in which cytoki - nesis is partially perturbed . Depletion of the kinesin component of centralspindlin , MKLP1 , causes disrup - tion of the central spindle , leading to mislocalization of ECT2 and expansion of the equatorial zone containing contractile - ring components [ 9 ] . However , half of these cells furrow . Recent evidence suggests that astral mi - crotubules locally modulate contractility by inhibiting recruitment of contractile - ring components [ 20 ] . Al - though depletion of either anillin or MKLP1 affects RhoA localization , in neither case does RhoA enter the most polar regions of the cell . In cells depleted of both MKLP1 and anillin , RhoA expands around the entire cor - tex of the cell , and furrows uniformly fail to form ( Movie S3 ) . Further , myosin and actin also expand around the entire cortex ( 27 / 27 cells for actin and 23 / 23 cells for my - osin , Figure 5 ) . Thus , the central spindle and anillin can independently promote RhoA localization and furrow formation . In the absence of the central spindle , anillin restricts myosin localization and thereby induces con - tractile - ring assembly . Figure 4 .

Times are indicated from anaphase onset . The dashed line marks the equatorial plane of the dividing cells . Current Biology Vol 18 No 1 34 Conclusions In both S . pombe and animal cells , anillin - like proteins are early markers of the nascent cleavage furrow [ 3 , 21 , 22 ] . In most systems , anillin is not required for furrow formation . C . elegans have three anillin - like proteins , and ani - 1 is required for contractile events in the early embryo , such as membrane rufﬂing and pseudocleav - age , but is not strictly required for cytokinesis [ 4 ] . Dro - sophila anillin is required for cellularization in early embryos and promotes late cytokinetic events in S2 cells [ 23 , 24 ] . Fission yeast express two anillin - related proteins , Mid1p and Mid2p , which regulate proper posi - tioning of the division plane and septation , respectively [ 21 , 25 – 27 ] . Whereas in human cells anillin localizes via its C - terminal Rho binding domain , in S . pombe mid1p localization involves a C - terminal amphipathic helix [ 28 ] . Interestingly , the AHD is not well conserved in mid1p , nor is there compelling evidence that RhoA triggers contractile - ring formation in S . pombe . Thus , various organisms might employ distinct mechanisms to re - cruit anillin , which executes its conserved function as a scaffold protein in the contractile ring .
