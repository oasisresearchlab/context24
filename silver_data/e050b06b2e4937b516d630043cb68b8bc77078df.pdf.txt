REVIEW Advances in natural language processing Julia Hirschberg 1 * and Christopher D . Manning 2 , 3 Natural language processing employs computational techniques for the purpose of learning , understanding , and producing human language content . Early computational approaches to language research focused on automating the analysis of the linguistic structure of language anddevelopingbasictechnologiessuchasmachinetranslation , speechrecognition , andspeech synthesis . Today ’ s researchers refine and make use of such tools in real - world applications , creating spoken dialogue systems and speech - to - speech translation engines , mining social media for information about health or finance , and identifying sentiment and emotion toward products and services . We describe successes and challenges in this rapidly advancing area . O ver the past 20 years , computational lin - guistics has grown into both an exciting area of scientific research and a practical technology that is increasingly being in - corporated into consumer products ( for example , in applications such as Apple ’ s Siri and SkypeTranslator ) . Fourkeyfactorsenabledthese developments : ( i ) a vast increase in computing power , ( ii ) the availability of very large amounts of linguistic data , ( iii ) the development of highly successful machine learning ( ML ) methods , and ( iv ) amuch richer understanding ofthestructure of human language and its deployment in social contexts . In this Review , we describe some cur - rent application areas of interest in language research . These efforts illustrate computational approaches to big data , based on current cutting - edge methodologies that combine statistical anal - ysis and ML with knowledge of language . Computational linguistics , also known as nat - ural language processing ( NLP ) , is the subfield of computer science concerned with using com - putational techniques to learn , understand , and produce human language content . Computation - al linguistic systems can have multiple purposes : The goal can be aiding human - human commu - nication , such as in machine translation ( MT ) ; aiding human - machine communication , such as with conversational agents ; or benefiting both humans and machines by analyzing and learn - ing from the enormous quantity of human lan - guage content that is now available online . During the first several decades of work in computational linguistics , scientists attempted to write down for computers the vocabularies and rules of human languages . This proved a difficult task , owing to the variability , ambiguity , and context - dependent interpretation of human languages . For instance , a star can be either an astronomical object or a person , and “ star ” can be a noun or a verb . In another example , two in - terpretationsarepossiblefortheheadline “ Teacher strikesidlekids , ” dependingonthenoun , verb , and adjectiveassignmentsofthewordsinthesentence , aswellasgrammaticalstructure . Beginning in the 1980s , but more widely in the 1990s , NLP was transformedbyresearchersstartingtobuildmod - els over large quantities of empirical language data . Statisticalorcorpus ( “ bodyofwords ” ) – based NLP was one of the first notable successes of the use of big data , long before the power of ML was more generally recognized or the term “ big data ” even introduced . A central finding of this statistical approach to NLP has been that simple methods using words , part - of - speech ( POS ) sequences ( such as whether a word is a noun , verb , or preposition ) , or simple templates can often achieve notable results when trained on large quantities of data . Many text and sentiment classifiers are still based solely on the different sets of words ( “ bag of words ” ) that documents contain , without regard to sentence and discourse structure or meaning . Achieving improvementsover these simple baselinescanbe quite difficult . Nevertheless , the best - performing systems now use sophisticated ML approaches and a rich understanding of linguistic structure . High - performance tools that identify syntactic and semantic information aswell as information about discourse context are now available . One example is Stanford CoreNLP ( 1 ) , which provides a standard NLP preprocessing pipeline that in - cludes POS tagging ( with tags such as noun , verb , and preposition ) ; identification of named entities , such as people , places , and organizations ; parsing of sentences into their grammatical structures ; and identifying co - references between noun phrase mentions ( Fig . 1 ) . Historically , two developments enabled the initial transformation of NLP into a big data field . The first was the early availability to researchers of linguistic data in digital form , particularly through the Linguistic Data Consortium ( LDC ) ( 2 ) , established in 1992 . Today , large amounts of digital text can easily be downloaded from the Web . Available as linguistically annotated data are large speech and text corpora anno - tated with POS tags , syntactic parses , semantic labels , annotations of named entities ( persons , places , organizations ) , dialogue acts ( statement , question , request ) , emotions and positive or neg - ative sentiment , and discourse structure ( topic or rhetorical structure ) . Second , performance im - provements in NLP were spurred on by shared task competitions . Originally , these competitions were largely funded and organized by the U . S . Department of Defense , but they were later or - ganized by the research community itself , such as the CoNLL Shared Tasks ( 3 ) . These tasks were a precursor of modern ML predictive modeling and analytics competitions , such as on Kaggle ( 4 ) , in which companies and researchers post their dataandstatisticiansanddataminersfromallovertheworldcompetetoproducethebestmodels . AmajorlimitationofNLPtodayisthefactthatmostNLPresourcesandsystemsareavailableonlyforhigh - resource languages ( HRLs ) , such as English , French , Spanish , German , and Chinese . Incontrast , manylow - resourcelanguages ( LRLs ) — such as Bengali , Indonesian , Punjabi , Cebuano , and Swahili — spoken and written by millions of people have no such resources or systems avail - able . Afuturechallengeforthelanguagecommu - nity is how to develop resources and tools for hundredsorthousandsoflanguages , notjustafew . Machine translation Proficiency in languages was traditionally a hall - mark of a learned person . Although the social standing of this human skill has declined in the modern age of science and machines , translation between human languages remains crucially im - portant , and MT is perhaps the most substantial wayinwhichcomputerscouldaidhuman - human communication . Moreover , the ability of com - puters to translate between human languages remains a consummate test of machine intel - ligence : Correct translation requires not only the ability to analyze and generate sentences in human languages but also a humanlike under - standing of world knowledge and context , de - spite the ambiguities of languages . For example , theFrenchword “ bordel ” straightforwardlymeans “ brothel ” ; but if someone says “ My room is un bordel , ” thena translating machine hasto know enoughtosuspectthatthispersonisprobablynot running a brothel in his or her room but rather is saying “ My room is a complete mess . ” Machine translation was one of the first non - numericapplicationsofcomputersandwasstudiedintensivelystartinginthelate1950s . However , the hand - built grammar - based systems of early dec - ades achieved very limited success . The field was transformed in the early 1990s when researchers at IBM acquired a large quantity of English and French sentences that were translations of each other ( known as parallel text ) , produced as the proceedingsofthebilingualCanadianParliament . These data allowed them to collect statistics of word translations and word sequences and to build a probabilistic model of MT ( 5 ) . Following a quiet period in the late 1990s , the new millennium brought the potent combina - tion of ample online text , including considerable quantities of parallel text , much more abundant and inexpensive computing , and a new idea for building statistical phrase - based MT systems SCIENCE sciencemag . org 17 JULY 2015 (cid:127) VOL 349 ISSUE 6245 261 1 Department of Computer Science , Columbia University , New York , NY 10027 , USA . 2 Department of Linguistics , Stanford University , Stanford , CA 94305 - 2150 , USA . 3 Department of Computer Science , Stanford University , Stanford , CA 94305 - 9020 , USA . * Corresponding author .

Rather than translating word by word , the key advance is to notice that small word groups often have distinctive translations . The Japa - nese “ mizu iro ” is literally the sequence of two words ( “ water color ” ) , but this is not the correct meaning ( nor does it mean a type of painting ) ; rather , it indicates a light , sky - blue color . Such phrase - based MT was used by Franz Och in the development of Google Translate . This technology enabled the services we have today , which allow free and instant translation between many language pairs , but it still pro - duces translations that are only just serviceable for determining the gist of a passage . However , very promising work continues to push MT for - ward . Much subsequent research has aimed to better exploit the structure of human language sentences ( i . e . , their syntax ) in translation sys - tems ( 7 , 8 ) , and researchers are actively building deeper meaning representations of language ( 9 ) to enable a new level of semantic MT . Finally , just in the past year , we have seen the developmentofanextremelypromisingapproachtoMTthroughtheuseofdeep - learning – based sequence models . The central idea of deep learn - ing is that if we can train a model with several representational levels to optimize a final objec - tive , such as translation quality , then the model can itself learn intermediate representations that are useful for the task at hand . This idea has been explored particularly for neural net - work models in which information is stored in real - valued vectors , with the mapping between vectors consisting of a matrix multiplication fol - lowed by a nonlinearity , such as a sigmoid func - tion that maps the output values of the matrix multiplication onto [ − 1 , 1 ] . Building large models of this form is much more practical with the massive parallel computation that is now econo - micallyavailableviagraphicsprocessingunits . For translation , research has focused on a particular versionofrecurrentneuralnetworks , withenhanced “ long short - term memory ” computational units that can better maintain contextual information from early until late in a sentence ( 10 , 11 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Thedistributedrepresentationsofneuralnetworksareoftenveryeffectiveforcapturingsubtleseman - tic similarities , and neural MT systems have al - readyproducedsome state - of - the - artresults ( 12 , 13 ) . A still - underexplored area in MT is getting ma - chines to have more of a sense of discourse , so that a sequence of sentences translates naturally — although work in the area has begun ( 14 ) . Finally , MT is not necessarily a task for machines to do alone . Rather it can be reconceptualized as an op - portunity for computer - supported cooperative work that also exploits human skills ( 15 ) . In such a system , machine intelligence is aimed at human - computer interface capabilities of giving effective suggestions and reacting productively to human input , rather than wholly replacing the skills and knowledge of a human translator . Spoken dialogue systems and conversational agents Dialogue has been a popular topic in NLP re - search since the 1980s . However , early work on text - baseddialoguehasnowexpandedtoinclude spoken dialogue on mobile devices ( e . g . , Apple ’ s Siri , Amtrak ’ s Julie , Google Now , and Microsoft ’ s Cortana ) for information access and task - based apps . Spoken dialogue systems ( SDSs ) also allow robots to help people with simple manual tasks [ e . g . , Manuela Veloso ’ s CoBots ( 16 ) ] or provide therapyforless - abledpersons [ e . g . , MajaMataric ’ s socially assistive robots ( 17 ) ] . They also enable ava - tarstotutorpeopleininterviewornegotiationstra - tegies or to help with health care decisions ( 18 , 19 ) . The creation of SDSs , whether between hu - mans or between humans and artificial agents , requires tools for automatic speech recognition ( ASR ) , to identify what a human says ; dialogue management ( DM ) , to determine what that hu - man wants ; actions to obtain the information or perform the activity requested ; and text - to - speech ( TTS ) synthesis , to convey that information back to the human in spoken form . ( Fig . 3 ) . In addition , SDSs need to be ready to interact with users when an error in speech recognition occurs ; to decide what words might be incorrectly recognized ; and to determine what the user actually said , either automatically or via dialogue with the user . In speech - to - speech translation systems , MT com - ponents are also needed to facilitate dialogue between speakers of different languages and the system , to identify potential mistranslations before they occur , and to clarify these with the speaker . Practical SDSs have been enabled by break - throughs in speech recognition accuracy , mainly coming from replacing traditional acoustic feature – modeling pipelines with deep - learning models that mapsoundsignalstosequencesofhumanlanguagesoundsandwords ( 20 ) . Although SDSs now work fairly well in limited domains , where the topics of the interaction are known in advance and where the words people are likely to use can be predeter - mined , they are not yet very successful in open - domain interaction , where users may talk about anything at all . Chatbots following in the tradition of ELIZA ( 21 ) handle open - domain interaction by cleverly repeating variations of the human input ; 262 17 JULY 2015 (cid:127) VOL 349 ISSUE 6245 sciencemag . org SCIENCE case aux nsubj M Mrs .

In spoken dia - logue , information about the speaker ’ s mental state inferred from multimodal information can be used to supplement the system ’ s knowledge of what the user is saying . There are many challenges in building SDSs , in addition to the primary challenge of improv - ing the accuracy of the basic ASR , DM , and TTS building blocks and extending their use into less - restricted domains . These include basic problems of recognizing and producing normal human conversational behaviors , such as turn - taking and coordination . Humans interpret subtle cues in speakers ’ voices and facial and body gestures ( where available ) to determine when the speaker isreadyto giveuptheturnversussimplypausing . These cues , such as a filled pause ( e . g . , “ um ” or “ uh ” ) , are also used to establish when some feedback from the listener is desirable , to indi - cate that he or she is listening or working on a request , as well as to provide “ grounding ” ( i . e . , information about the current state of the con - versation ) . Non – humanlike latency often makes SDS burdensome , as users must wait seconds to receive a system response . To address this , re - searchers are exploring incremental processing of ASR , MT , and TTS modules , so that systems can respond more quickly to users by beginning these recognition , translation , and generation processes while the user is still speaking . Hu - mans can also disambiguate words such as “ yeah ” and “ okay , ” which may have diverse meanings — including agreement , topic shift , and even disagreement — when spoken in different ways . In successful and cooperative conversations , hu - mans also tend to entrain to their conversational partners , becoming more similar to each other in pronunciation , word choice , acoustic and pro - sodic features , facial expressions , and gestures . This tendency has long been used to subtly in - duce SDS users to employ terms that the system can more easily recognize . Currently , research - ers are beginning to believe that systems ( parti - cularly embodied agents ) should entrain to their users in these different modalities , and some ex - perimental results have shown that users prefer such systems ( 23 ) and even think they are more intelligent ( 24 ) . OpenissuesforDMhavelongbeen the determination of how to architect the appro - priate dialogue flow for particular applications , where existing experimental data may be sparse and some aspects of the dialogue state may not yet havebeenobservedorevenbeobservablefromthedata . Currently , the most widely used approach is the POMDP ( partially observable Markov decision process ) , which attempts to identify an optimal system policy by maintaining a probability distri - bution over possible SDS states and updating this distribution as the system observes additional dialogue behavior ( 25 ) . This approach may make use of the identification of dialogue acts , such as whether the user input represents a question , statement , orindicationofagreement , forexample . Machine reading The printed word has great power to enlighten . Machine reading is the idea that machines could become intelligent , and could usefully integrate and summarizeinformation for humans , byread - ing and understanding the vast quantities of text that are available . Intheearlydecadesofartificialintelligence , many researchers focused on the approach of trying to enable intelligent machines by manually building large structured knowledge basesin aformallogi - cal language and developing automated reasoning methodsfor deriving further facts fromthisknowl - edge . However , with the emergence of the mod - ern online world , what we mainly have instead is huge repositories of online information coded in human languages . One place where this is true is in the scientific literature , where findings are still reported almost entirely in human language text ( with accompanying tables and diagrams ) . How - ever , it is equally true for more general knowledge , where we now have huge repositories of infor - mation such as Wikipedia ( 26 ) . The quantity of scientific literature is growing rapidly : For example , the size of the U . S . National Library of Medicine ’ s Medline index has grown exponentially ( 27 ) . At such a scale , scientists are unable to keep upwith the literature , even in their narrow domains of expertise . Thus , there is an increased need for machinereadingforthepurposesofcomprehend - ing and summarizing the literature , as well as ex - tracting facts and hypotheses from this material . An initial goal is to extract basic facts , most commonly a relation between two entities , such as “ child of ” ( for instance , Bill Clinton , Chelsea Clinton ) . This is referred to as relation extrac - tion . For particular domain - specific relations , many such systems have been successfully built . One technique is to use handwritten patterns that match the linguistic expression of relations ( e . g . , < PERSON > ’ s daughter , < PERSON > ) .

Initially trained on parallel sentences that translate each other , the modellearnsarepresentation ofeach wordasa real - valuedvectorandinternal parametermatricesso as to optimize translation quality . The trained network can then translate new sentences . Each arrow represents a computation unit of a matrix multiplication followed by a nonlinear transformation ; the small vectors shown in the illustration might really be 1000 - dimensional . The recurrent network first encodes the meaning of the source sentence ( left side , blue ) . It maintains an internal state representing a partial sentence , which is updated after each new word is read ( horizontal arrows ) . Having the upper network layers [ mapped to by additional ( upper vertical ) computation arrows ] makes this a deep recurrent network . Adding depth improves the ability of the model to learn , generalize , and remember . Once the end of the sentence ( denoted by < EOS > ) is reached ( middle , dark blue ) , the network additionally starts to produce a word of translated output at each step from its internal state ( using a multiclass logistic regression – style model ) . During translation generation ( right side , green ) , the last generated word is fed in as the input at each step . From the stored hidden state and this input , the model calculates the next word of the translation . This process repeats until < EOS > is generated . on S ep t e m be r 6 , 20 18 h tt p : / / sc i en c e . sc i en c e m ag . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m ML . A structured prediction classifier proposes instances of such relations based on extracted features from the sequence of words and gram - matical structure of a sentence ( 28 , 29 ) . Such sys - tems are the mainstay of literature fact - extraction tools in fields such as biomedicine ( 30 , 31 ) . In many scientific fields , there have been ma - jor efforts to build databases of structured infor - mation based on the textual scientific record , such as the Gene Ontology database ( 32 ) in bio - medicine or the PaleoBiology Database for fossil records ( 33 ) . This has generally been done man - ually , via concerted work by trained profes - sionals . Using artificial intelligence software to extract these databases , as well as to perform subsequent reasoning and hypothesis genera - tion , has become a major research goal . One subfield where these questions have been ac - tively pursued is pharmacogenomics ( 34 ) . For example , Percha et al . ( 35 ) trained a model of drug - drug interactions based on drug - gene in - teractions extracted from the literature and were abletouseittopredictnoveldrug - druginteractions . Ifapartialknowledgebase — forinstance , Freebase ( 36 ) , dbpedia ( 37 ) , Wikidata ( 38 ) ( related to Wikipe - dia ) , ortheGeneOntologydatabase ( 32 ) — hasalready been extracted from biomedical research articles , then there is an opportunity to automatically align known facts from the knowledge base with puta - tiveexpressionsofthosefactsintext . Thetypelabels from this mapping can then be used as if they were supervised data for ML information - extraction sys - tems ( Fig . 4 ) . This is referred to as distantly super - vised relation extraction . Early systems aligned entity mentions and then made the naïve assump - tion that sentences containing a pair of entities expressed every known relation between the two entities in the database ( 39 ) . More recent systems have used increasingly sophisticated probabilistic inference to discern which textual clauses map to whichfactsintheknowledgebase , ortosomething else entirely ( 40 , 41 ) . A dramatic recent applica - tion of this approach has been the DeepDive sys - tem ( 42 ) , which aims to automate the construction of such systems by providing efficient large - scale learning and inference so a user can simply focus on good features for their domain . PaleoDeepDive , itsapplicationtothefossilrecord , has recentlybeen shown to do a better job at fact extraction from journal articles than the scientist volunteers who maintain the PaleoBiology Database ( 43 ) . The relation - extraction task is made general , if less semantically precise , by aiming to ex - tract all relations from any piece of text , a task normally referred to as open information ex - traction ( Open IE ) ( 44 ) . Early work emphasized the development of simple but highly scalable fact - extraction techniques that do not require any kind of hand - labeled data ( 45 ) . With ever - growing computational power , a second genera - tion of work increasingly emphasized careful use of linguistic structure , which can reliably be ex - tracted with the use of detailed NLP ( 46 ) . Currently , a number of avenues are being explored to further extend the ability of compu - ters to build and use knowledge bases starting from textual information . An exciting unification is the proposal for universal schemas ( 47 ) , which allow simultaneous inference and knowledge - base completion over both the open set of textual relations ( such as “ born in ” ) found in Open IE and the more exact schema of databases ( such as per : city _ of _ birth ) . Even with all of our text - extraction techniques , any knowledge base will only be partial and incomplete ; some recent work explores how it can be probabilistically com - pleted to deliver a form of common - sense rea - soning ( 48 ) . Finally , we hope to move beyond simply extracting relations , events , and facts to be able to understand the relations between events ( such as causation ) and complex multistep procedures and processes . In ( 49 ) , Berant et al . explore how this can be done for understanding the steps in biological processes , showing that extracting explicit process structures can improve theaccuracyofquestionanswering . Theflipsideof machine reading is to provide question - answering systems , by which humans can get answers from constructed knowledge bases . There has recently been dramatic progress in building such systems by learning semantic parsers ( 50 ) . Mining social media The development of social media has revolution - ized the amount and types of information avail - able today to NLP researchers . Data available fromsourcessuchasTwitter , Facebook , YouTube , blogs , and discussion forums make it possible to examine relations between demographic in - formation , language use , and social interaction ( 51 ) . Researchers use Web - scraping techniques , often via application program interfaces pro - vided by websites , to download previously unim - aginable amounts and categories of data . Using statistical and ML techniques , they learn to iden - tify demographic information ( such as age and gender ) fromlanguage , tracktrendingtopicsand popular sentiment , identify opinions and beliefs about products and politicians , predict disease spreading ( for instance , with Google Flu Trends : www . google . org / flutrends / ) from symptoms men - tioned in tweets or food - related illnesses ( 52 ) , recognize deception in fake reviews ( 53 ) , and identify social networks of people who interact together online . In this era of big data , the availability of social media has revolutionized the ways advertisers , journalists , businesses , politicians , and medical experts acquire their data and the ways in which those data can be put to practical use . Product reviews can be mined to predict pricing trends and assess advertising campaigns . Political forums can be searched to predict candidate appeal and performance in elections . Social networks can be examined to find indicators of power and influ - ence among different groups . Medical forums can be studied to discover common questions and misconceptions about sufferers from particular medical conditions so that website information can be improved . Social media also provide very large and rich sources of conversational data in Web forums that can provide “ found ” data for the study of lan - guagephenomenasuchascode - switching ( mixed 264 17 JULY 2015 (cid:127) VOL 349 ISSUE 6245 sciencemag . org SCIENCE John Curtin The Right Honourable 14th Prime Minister of Australia Elections : 1937 , 1940 , 1943 Personal details Born John Joseph Curtin 8 January 1885 Creswick , Colony of Victoria British Empire Died 5 July 1945 ( aged 60 ) Canberra , Australia John Curtin ( 1885 - 1945 ) , prime minister and journalist , was born on 8 January 1885 at Creswick , Victoria , eldest of four children of Irish - born parents John Curtin and his wife Catherine ( Kate ) Agnes , née Bourke . . . . per : city _ of _ birth per : date _ of _ birth Learn how to extract slots from free text : was born on < DATE > born . . . at < LOCATION > per : city _ of _ birth per : date _ of _ birth Fig . 4 .

Social media exist in a wide variety of languages , including both HRLs and LRLs . These data can be invaluable for enriching ASR language models and developing TTS synthe - sizers without the need to create costly special - purposecorpora . In turn , these technologies can be useful in producing SDSs in LRL areas . Such systems can provide millions of people with the abilitytoobtaininformationovertheircellphones ( which are ubiquitous , even among populations with low literacy rates or whose languages or dialects have no standard written form ) , similar to the residents of HRL countries . The development of tools for LRLs from found LRL data , by adapt - ing HRL tools , is another important way to use found text data . A particular application of data mining in LRLs is the mining of data collected from Twitter or blogs to provide valuable infor - mation for disaster relief organizations , identify - ing the most serious problems , where they occur , and who is experiencing them . Therearealsosomedrawbackstosocialmedia data mining . There is an increasing concern for privacy issues , particularly for an individual ’ s con - trol over their own data versus researchers ’ desire to mine it . Sites such as Twitter severely limit a researcher ’ s ability to download data , which im - pedes speedy corpus collection . There is also a major issue with discovering “ ground truth ” in online postings , because there is no clear way of validatinganindividual ’ sdemographicinformation ; the validity of posts concerning events ; and most reviews of hotels , restaurants , and products . Aggre - gating information from multiple sources at similar times can address some validity issues , and sites do attempt to identify spurious reviews , but this issue remains perhaps the most difficult one for those working with social media data . Analysis and generation of speaker state Speaker states ( 54 ) , also termed “ private states ” ( 55 ) , include opinions , speculations , beliefs , emo - tions , and any other evaluative views that are personally held by the speaker or writer of a language . Much of the work in NLP has focused on sentiment analysis ( identification of positive or negative orientation of textual language ) and identification of belief states ( committed belief , uncommitted belief , or neutrality of a sentence ) on the basis of lexical and syntactic information . Both sentiment and belief constitute attitudes to - ward events and propositions , although sentiment can also concern attitudes toward objects such as people , organizations , and abstract concepts . De - tection of sentiment and emotion in text requires lexical and sentence - level information . Sentiment can be signaled by words conveying positive or negative orientation : For example , “ sad , ” “ worried , ” “ difficult , ” and “ weak ” are all words with negative orientation , whereas “ comfortable , ” “ important , ” “ successful , ” and “ interesting ” convey a positive sentiment . Online sentiment dictionaries , such as Whissel ’ s Dictionary of Affect ( 56 ) , and systems createdfromsubject - rankedterms , suchas Tausczik and Pennebaker ’ s LIWC ( Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count ) ( 57 ) , can be used to assess positive and negative sentiment in a text . More sophis - ticated approaches to sentiment analysis also seek toidentifytheholder ( source ) as well as the object ofthesentiment : forinstance , whoispositive about what person , country , activity , or concept ( 55 ) . The speech community has also studied pos - itive and negative attitudes by focusing more generally on the identification of positive and neg - ative emotions , primarily using acoustic and pro - sodicinformation . However , moreworkiscurrently being done to identify particular emotions , such as Ekman ’ s classic six basic emotions ( anger , dis - gust , fear , happiness , sadness , surprise ) , which maybereactionstoevents , propositions , orobjects . There has also been considerable research using features that have proven important in recog - nizing classic emotions to identify other speak - er states ( such as deception ) , medical conditions ( suchasautismandParkinson ’ sdisease ) , speaker characteristics ( such as age , gender , likeability , pathology , andpersonality ) , andspeakerconditions ( such as cognitive load , drunkenness , sleepiness , interest , and trust ) . Corpora collected for such studies have been used in the Interspeech Para - linguistic Challenges , which have been conducted since 2009 . Emotion generation has proven a moredifficultchallengeforTTSsynthesis . Although there are some systems ( e . g . , MARY ) that at - tempt to generate emotions such as depression , aggression , or cheerfulness ( 58 ) , the best synthe - sizedemotionstillcomesfromcorporarecordedforparticularemotionsbyvoicetalentimitatingthoseemotions . Sentiment classification is widely used in opin - ion identification ( positive or negative views of people , institutions , or ideas ) in many languages and genres . Particular applications abound , such as identifying positive and negative movie or pro - ductreviews ( 59 , 60 ) andpredictingvotesfromcon - gressional records ( 61 ) or Supreme Court decisions fromcourtproceedings .

Miningsocialmediaforsentimentorclassicemo - tions has been a particularly popular topic for the purposes of assessing the “ public mood ” from Twit - ter , predicting stock market trends , or simply eval - uatingacommunity ’ smentalstate ( 62 ) .

Conclusion and outlook Many times during the past 50 years , enthusi - astic researchers have had high hopes that the language - understanding ability of robots in sci - ence fiction movies was just around the corner . However , in reality , speech and language under - standing did not work well enough at that time to power mainstream applications . The situation hasbeenchangingdramaticallyoverthepastfiveyears . Huge improvements in speech recognition have made talking to your phone a commonplace activity , especially for young people . Web search enginesareincreasinglysuccessfulinunderstandingcomplexqueries , and MT can at least yield the gist of material in another language , even if it cannot yet produce human - quality translations . Com - puter systems trade stocks and futures auto - matically , basedonthesentimentofreportsabout companies . As a result , there is now great com - mercial interest in the deployment of human language technology , especially because natural language represents such a natural interface when interacting with mobile phones . In the short term , we feel confident that more data and computation , in addition to recent advances in ML and deep learning , will lead to further substantial progress in NLP .

Sentiment analysis is shown on the left ( blue , positive sentiments ; red , negative ; gray , neutral ) . In the emotion analysis on the right , emotions are shown in bold type and delineated by square brackets . Note in particular the importance of going beyond simple keyword analysis ; forexample , “ not ” has scope over “ bad , ” which might mislead simple systems . Also , the presence of “ hedge ” words and phrases , which muddle the intended meaning ( e . g . , “ pretty , ” which has a positive connotation , modifying the negative word “ terrible ” ) , somewhat decreases the negative score of the next clause . on S ep t e m be r 6 , 20 18 h tt p : / / sc i en c e . sc i en c e m ag . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m knowledge will probably require new discov - eries in linguistics and inference . From this per - spective , it is worth noting that the development of probabilistic approaches to language is not simply about solving engineering problems : Prob - abilistic models oflanguagehavealsobeenreflected back into linguistic science , where researchers are finding important new applications in describing phonology ( 66 ) , understanding human language processing ( 67 ) , and modeling linguistic seman - tics and pragmatics ( 68 ) . Many areas of linguistics are themselves becoming more empirical and more quantitative in their approaches . REFERENCES AND NOTES 1 . C . D . Manning , M . Surdeanu , J . Bauer , J . Finkel , S . J .
