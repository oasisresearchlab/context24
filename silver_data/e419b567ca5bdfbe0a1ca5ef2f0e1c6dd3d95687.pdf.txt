( Gardel et al . 2008 J . Cell Biol . 183 , 999 – 1005 ( doi : 10 . 1083 / jcb . 200810060 ) ) , include a bipha - sic velocity - dependent traction stress acting on the actin network . While we chose certain specific models for each of these , in part to allow for an analyti - cal solution , the generality of the framework allows one to readily introduce different constitutive laws to describe these phenomena as might be needed , for example , to study some different type of cells . As described in § 5 , the pre - dictions of the model compare well with observations such as the magnitude of the very different actin retrograde speeds in the lamellum and lamellipo - dium including their jump at the interface , the magnitude of the cell speed , and the relative lengths of the lamellipodium and lamellum . 1 . Introduction Decades of research into cell locomotion have resulted in a detailed picture of the microscopic and biochemical mechanisms behind it . It is now well known that actin turnover , myosin contraction and molecular adhesion to the substrate play critical roles in cell locomotion , irrespective of the type of cell studied , e . g . fish keratocytes , mammalian fibroblasts or cancer cells . The general picture that has emerged is that rapid actin polymerization at the leading edge pushes the cell membrane forward . In addition , it , and the contractile activity of the myosin further behind , causes the actin network to move back - wards ( so - called retrograde flow ) . This flow is resisted by the forces exerted by the adhesions that attach the actin cytoskeleton to the substrate through mol - ecular clutches . Myosin activity also helps the depolymerization and / or break up of the actin network near the trailing edge so that the monomers go back into the cell cytoplasm and become available for polymerization at the leading edge to repeat the cycle . We refer the reader to recent review articles ( e . g . [ 1 – 6 ] ) and references therein for a detailed discussion of the mechanisms and of cell locomotion . There are a great many models of cell locomotion in the literature that describe various aspects of cell motion . The models vary , depending on what particular questions they are focused on ; some treat the biochemical processes in great detail , while others are more mechanistic in nature ; and they range from the nanoscale to the continuum scale . In the next two subsections , we describe a few select models , first two - dimensional models and then one - dimensional models , and thereafter we place the present paper in the context of this literature . © 2024 The Author ( s ) Published by the Royal Society . All rights reserved . 1 . 1 . Examples of two - dimensional models Theoretical models of cell locomotion have grown in sophis - tication over the last two decades . The literature on this topic is large enough that an exhaustive review is beyond the scope of this paper ; rather than attempting such an exercise we mention here a few of those papers with continuum models that enlightened us about the mechanics at play . A two - dimensional continuum model of locomotion of keratocyte fragments appears in , e . g . Ofer et al . [ 7 ] and Keren et al . [ 8 ] . This model takes account of the variation in actin network density as a function of position . A similar , but simpler , two - dimensional continuum model that couples actin density at the leading edge and the edge ’ s geometrical evolution is given by Adler & Givli [ 9 ] . Both these models ignore myosin contraction and the resulting traction stress exerted by focal adhesions on the actin cytoskeleton which play important roles in the crawling motion of cells on substrates [ 4 , 5 ] . These traction stresses are taken into account in the two - dimensional model of Zhang et al . [ 10 ] . These authors assume that the actin retrograde speed varies linearly with distance from a fixed point moving with the cell and that the traction stress due to the substrate is proportional to the retrograde speed . As a final two - dimensional example , Ippolito et al . [ 11 ] propose a new ‘ homeostatic Langevin equation ’ to simu - late an ensemble of live cells which are out of equilibrium and exchanging matter and energy with their environments to predict overall cellular behaviour . 1 . 2 . Examples of one - dimensional models There is also a suite of one - dimensional continuum models of cell locomotion , too numerous to describe in detail here . A model that focuses on the dynamics of focal adhesions and considers their elasticity together with chemical and mechanical driving forces for their attachment / detachment is in Olberding et al . [ 12 ] . These authors consider the kinetics of the focal adhesions rather than the actin network to deter - mine cell speeds . A model that accounts for the viscoelasticity of the substrate and the stochasticity of the attachment / detachment of adhesions is described in Gong et al . [ 13 ] that captures the dynamic behaviour of the ‘ clutch ’ molecules on various substrates . A model that considers the equilibrium of the actin network itself together with stress - dependent kinetics of actin polymerization / depolymerization at the leading / trailing edges is described in Bayly et al . [ 14 ] . This model also accounts for the transmission of force by the cell membrane and the traction stresses exerted on the cytoskele - ton by adhesions due to myosin pulling on them through the actin network , but it too ignores the elasticity of the actin network . A rather interesting and recent one - dimensional model [ 15 ] takes account of stochastic binding / unbinding of clutch molecules with force - dependent unbinding rates that gives rise to a biphasic dependence of the traction stress on actin retrograde speed and leads to a dynamical system that exhibits bifurcations that can explain alternating phases of growth and retraction seen in cells . The kinetics of polymerization / depolymerization at the leading / trailing edges is treated in a simple manner in this work because its primary focus is on the overall behaviour of the dynamical system . The cell is treated as a dynamical system also in Ron et al . [ 16 ] . The key idea in this work is that the kinetics of the adhesions at the rear of the cell are different from those responsible for tractions in the front , and that these differences give rise to both stick – slip and smooth cell loco - motion depending on just two non - dimensional parameters . All of the continuum models mentioned above address important aspects of the crawling motion of cells on sub - strates . However , most of them ignore the elasticity of the cytoskeleton itself ( expected to be important based on the experiments in [ 17 , 18 ] ) and adopt simple descriptions of the treadmilling of the actin network . None of them con - sider hydrolysis of ATP - actin to ADP - actin which is a driver of treadmilling , and none distinguish between the lamellum and lamellipodium . These aspects turn out to be important for epithelial cells and they are connected to the biphasic traction – velocity relation as discussed below . 1 . 3 . Biphasic traction stress and experiments In the present paper , we will concern ourselves with loco - motion of single epithelial cells on rigid substrates , although most work on cell locomotion has adopted the fast moving fish keratocyte and fibroblasts as model systems . Our goal is to construct a continuum mechanical model of cell locomotion and we chose motile PtK1 epithelial cells as our system because a series of experimental papers by Waterman and colleagues has provided detailed mechanical information about them . The actin cytoskeleton in these cells is divided into two regions — the lamellipodium at the leading edge which may be a few micrometres long , and the lamellum further behind which is usually much longer and can be several micrometres long . The lamellipodium has a dense actin network that is characterized by minimal myosin activity . The lamellum has a less dense actin network ( due to depolymerization ) with myosin all over it . It has been argued that myosin activity increases as one moves inward from the cell periphery because myosin is pulling back the branched actin network [ 5 ] , and that myosin plays an important role in depolymerization / disassembly at the trailing edge [ 19 ] . The treadmilling of the actin cytoskeleton has been visualized in these cells by fluor - escent labelling and subsequent tracking of the label to produce kymographs [ 20 ] . This has shown that an actin unit in the network steadily moves backward from the leading edge toward the nucleus of the cell . The speed of this retro - grade flow of actin can be determined from the kymographs . Waterman and colleagues have shown in [ 21 ] that the retro - grade speed is high ( about 25 nm s − 1 ) in the lamellipodium near the leading edge , and low ( about 2 – 4 nm s − 1 ) over the lamellum . They report a sharp gradient in retrograde speed at the interface between the lamellum and lamellipodium . This region of sharp gradients is sometimes referred to as the lamellipodium base , or LP base . Adhesions start to form slightly behind the leading edge of the lamellipodium , they ‘ mature ’ as they move backwards in the reference frame of the moving cell , and finally detach at the trailing edge of the lamellum . A major finding of Waterman and colleagues in Gardel et al . [ 21 ] is that the strengthening and weakening of the adhesions are modu - lated by the retrograde actin speed , with the peak traction stress occurring at an intermediate speed of about 8 nm s − 1 . The traction stress increases with the retrograde speed for low speeds and decreases for high speeds . Thus there is a low - speed phase and a high - speed phase . Remarkably , they showed that this biphasic relationship between the traction stress exerted by the adhesion and the actin speed persisted even in the absence of turnover ( or disassembly ) of the r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s i f J . R . S o c . I n t e r f a c e 21 : 20230543 2 adhesion . In our model , we will account for the key obser - vations in [ 21 ] by taking the traction stress to be a biphasic function of the retrograde speed . An alternative is to regard the traction stress to be a function of position in the cell frame of reference ; it can be shown that this leads to similar results . We favour a model with the traction stress dependent on the speed because it has been shown in recent work ( e . g . [ 22 ] , see also [ 23 ] ) that stochastic bonding / unbonding at the molecular scale , as occurs in a molecular clutch ( in the adhesions ) results in a velocity - dependent viscous force even though the individual bonds are modelled as ( nonlinear ) conservative elements . 1 . 4 . Biphasic traction stress and micromechanical modelling : examples A micro - mechanical explanation of a biphasic traction stress was given , e . g . by Sens [ 24 ] , who studied an actin filament sliding over a substrate covered with Hookean molecular springs . Springs attach stochastically to the filament , so that at any given instant , a spring can be either bound or unbound from the filament . Bound springs are stretched by the moving filament leading to a restoring force . Sens assumes the unbinding rate to depend exponentially on the spring force and calculates the relation between the average restor - ing force and the sliding velocity which turns out to be biphasic . Another study that gives an explanation of the biphasic traction stress in terms of the microscopic physics of membrane fluctuations , actin polymerization and adhesion binding is Lin [ 25 ] . By taking into account the role of adhe - sions , membrane tension and polymerization in a simple way Lin shows that at low speeds the adhesive force increases linearly in a viscous - like manner , while at high speeds , it falls off exponentially . Chelly et al . [ 26 ] provide the following intuitive explanation for a biphasic traction stress – velocity relation : when the actin velocity is sufficiently small , the force in the bound springs increases slowly and this leads to a linear increase in the traction stress with velocity . When the actin velocity is sufficiently large , the bonds break rapidly and the traction stress decreases with velocity . 1 . 5 . Deformation of the actin network The actin cytoskeleton polymerizes against the cell membrane at the leading edge of a moving cell . Consequently , the mem - brane exerts compressive forces on the actin network though the membrane itself is under tension . These compressive forces deform the actin network ( although each actin mono - mer may not deform very much ) . The importance of this deformation has been shown in the experiments of Parekh et al . [ 18 ] and Chaudhuri et al . [ 17 ] who polymerized actin against an atomic force microscope cantilever to measure the forces exerted and the associated deformation . Yet this defor - mation of the actin network has not been taken into account in most analytical models of cell locomotion . 1 . 6 . The present paper The aim of this paper is to place the cell locomotion problem within the general framework of continuum mechanics , and while doing so , to account for the deformation of the actin network in the cytoskeleton ; the myosin activity on the lamellum including its effect on depolymerization at the trailing edge ; model the stress - dependent driving forces and kinetic laws controlling polymerization at the leading edge , depolymerization at the trailing edge , and ATP hydrolysis consistently with the dissipation inequality ; and based on the observations in [ 21 ] , include a biphasic velocity - dependent traction stress acting on the actin network . While the particular characterizations we chose for each of these phenomena allowed for an analytical solution , the generality of this framework allows one , as needed , to readily introduce different constitutive laws for the actin cytoskeleton , different kinetic laws governing polymerization , depolymerization and ATP hydrolysis , and even different functional forms for the velocity - dependent traction stresses . The predictions of the model compare well with the observations in [ 21 ] . Specifically , ( i ) we find high retrograde speeds over the lamellipodium ( ≈ 23 nm s − 1 ) and low speeds over the lamellum ( ≈ 6 nm s − 1 ) ( figure 6 a ) ; ( ii ) there is a sharp gradient in the retrograde speed at the interface between the lamellum and lamellipodium , almost like a shock wave ( figure 6 b ) ; ( iii ) the length of the lamellipodium relative to the cell length ranges from 10 % to 40 % depending on the adhesion strength ( figure 8 b ) ; and ( iv ) we find cell speeds in the range 0 . 5 – 0 . 6 μ m min − 1 ( figure 5 b ) . As will be pointed out in § 5 , these are consistent with experimental observations . The present paper is organized as follows . The one - dimensional continuum mechanical model is presented in § 2 where in particular the biphasic traction stress – velocity relation is described in § 2 . 2 . After briefly describing the general framework underlying the modelling of irrevers - ible processes in § 2 . 4 , we go on to calculate the driving forces and kinetic relations associated with polymerization , depolymerization and ATP hydrolysis . In § 3 , we specialize the model to steady processes and then solve the steady - state problem in § 4 . The results are presented and discussed in § 5 and some concluding remarks are made in § 6 . In the electronic supplementary material , we present the calculation of the dissipation rate that was used to identify the driving forces ; explain how the traction stress enters the one - dimensional model as a body force ; describe how we arrived at the specific numerical values of the parameters used in this paper ; and provide a list of all the symbols used . 2 . The continuum mechanical model 2 . 1 . Field equations The actin polymer network is modelled as a one - dimensional continuum that at time t occupies an interval [ x 0 ( t ) , x 1 ( t ) ] in a reference configuration . The referential interval [ x 0 ( t ) , x 1 ( t ) ] is time - dependent because material points can be added to / removed from the body at its two ends due to polymerization / depolymerization . When _ x 0 . 0 , the left - hand referential boundary moves into [ x 0 ( t ) , x 1 ( t ) ] , i . e . into the existing body , and thus material points are lost from it . This describes depolymerization . If _ x 0 , 0 , this boundary moves away from the existing body and therefore material points are added to the body corresponding to polymeriz - ation . At the right - hand end , polymerization occurs for _ x 1 . 0 and depolymerization for _ x 1 , 0 . In the current configuration , the actin network occupies the interval [ y 0 ( t ) , y 1 ( t ) ] at time t , and the motion y ( · , t ) of r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s i f J .

Therefore , in particular at the two ends , y 0 ð t Þ ¼ y ð x 0 ð t Þ , t Þ and y 1 ð t Þ ¼ y ð x 1 ð t Þ , t Þ : ð 2 : 1 Þ The respective lengths of the network in the reference and current configurations are L ð t Þ ¼ x 1 ð t Þ (cid:3) x 0 ð t Þ and ‘ ð t Þ ¼ y 1 ð t Þ (cid:3) y 0 ð t Þ ; ð 2 : 2 Þ see figure 1 . The velocity v of a material point and stretch λ are given by v ð x , t Þ ¼ @ y @ t ð x , t Þ and l ð x , t Þ ¼ @ y @ x ð x , t Þ . 0 , ð 2 : 3 Þ and compatibility between ( 2 . 3 ) 1 and ( 2 . 3 ) 2 requires @ l @ t ¼ @ v @ x : ð 2 : 4 Þ The stress σ ( x , t ) obeys the equilibrium equation @ s @ x þ b ¼ 0 , ð 2 : 5 Þ where the so - called traction stress b ( x , t ) is a body force distrib - uted along the network . In the electronic supplemental material , we sketch how the traction distributed lengthwise along the bottom surface of the cytoskeleton enters the one - dimensional model as a body force in the continuum mechanical sense . Adhesion , mediated by focal adhesions between the actin network in the cell and the rigid substrate , gives rise to this traction and it plays a central role in the propulsion of the cell . We will say more about it in § 2 . 2 . Differentiating ( 2 . 1 ) with respect to time and using ( 2 . 3 ) gives _ y 0 ¼ l 0 _ x 0 þ v 0 and _ y 1 ¼ l 1 _ x 1 þ v 1 , ð 2 : 6 Þ where l a ð t Þ ¼ l ð x a ð t Þ , t Þ and v a ð t Þ ¼ v ð x a ð t Þ , t Þ are the stretches and particle velocities at the trailing and leading edges , α = 0 , 1 , respectively . Observe that ( 2 . 6 ) 2 involves three speeds : the speed _ y 1 of the cell leading edge in the cur - rent configuration , the speed v 1 of the material point that happens to be at the leading edge at that instant , and the polymerization rate _ x 1 . In the absence of polymerization , i . e . when _ x 1 ¼ 0 , ( 2 . 6 ) 2 tells us that _ y 1 ¼ v 1 but this is not true when polymerization occurs . Similarly ( 2 . 6 ) 1 relates the corresponding quantities at the trailing edge . In this study , we take the cell to be moving to the right , _ y 1 . 0 , though points on the actin network undergo ‘ retrograde flow ’ , i . e . they move to the left , v ( x , t ) < 0 . It is possible to have _ y 1 . 0 and v 1 < 0 in _ y 1 ¼ l 1 _ x 1 þ v 1 provided the polymeriz - ation rate _ x 1 . 0 is sufficiently fast . Next , we turn to the constitutive relation . The elastic constitutive stress response function b s ð l , x Þ is x - dependent because there are two distinct parts to the actin network : the lamellum associated with a segment ½ x 0 ð t Þ , x (cid:4) ð t ÞÞ towards the rear and the lamellipodium corresponding to ð x (cid:4) ð t Þ , x 1 ð t Þ(cid:2) in the front . We denote the associated elastic moduli by 1 E 0 and E 1 , respectively , assumed to be constants ; thus we take b s ð l , x Þ ¼ E 0 ð l (cid:3) 1 Þ for x [ ð x 0 ð t Þ , x (cid:4) ð t ÞÞ and b s ð l , x Þ ¼ E 1 ð l (cid:3) 1 Þ for x [ ð x (cid:4) ð t Þ , x 1 ð t ÞÞ . In addition , myosin is active on the lamellum where it has a contractile effect . We model this as we would a thermal contractile strain , i . e . by writing λ − 1 = σ / E 0 − β / E 0 , where σ ( x , t ) / E 0 is the elastic strain and β ( x , t ) / E 0 ( > 0 ) is the contractile strain due to the myosin . Thus we describe the actomyosin in the lamellum by the constitutive relation s ¼ E 0 ð l (cid:3) 1 Þ þ b , b ð x , t Þ . 0 , E 0 . 0 , x 0 ð t Þ , x , x (cid:4) ð t Þ , ð 2 : 7 Þ and the actin in the lamellipodium by s ¼ E 1 ð l (cid:3) 1 Þ , E 1 . 0 , x (cid:4) ð t Þ , x , x 1 ð t Þ , ð 2 : 8 Þ where we have assumed that myosin is minimally active in the lamellipodium and have therefore omitted its effect . On the lamellum , we assume that the myosin is maximally active at the trailing edge x 0 ( t ) and that its effect gradually decreases until it vanishes at the other end x (cid:4) ð t Þ . We take this variation to be linear : b ð x , t Þ ¼ b 0 x (cid:4) ð t Þ (cid:3) x x (cid:4) ð t Þ (cid:3) x 0 ð t Þ (cid:2) (cid:3) , b 0 . 0 , x 0 ð t Þ (cid:5) x (cid:5) x (cid:4) ð t Þ : ð 2 : 9 Þ Turning next to the interface x ¼ x (cid:4) ð t Þ between the lamel - lum and lamellipodium , the particle velocity and stretch are both discontinuous here and we denote their limiting values on the two sides of x (cid:4) ð t Þ by v + (cid:4) ð t Þ : ¼ v ð x + (cid:4) ð t Þ , t Þ and l + (cid:4) ð t Þ : ¼ l ð x + (cid:4) ð t Þ , t Þ : ð 2 : 10 Þ On the other hand , the stress σ ( · , t ) and motion y ( · , t ) must be continuous at x (cid:4) ð t Þ : s (cid:4) ð t Þ : ¼ s ð x þ(cid:4) ð t Þ , t Þ ¼ s ð x (cid:3)(cid:4) ð t Þ , t Þ and y (cid:4) ð t Þ : ¼ y ð x þ(cid:4) ð t Þ , t Þ ¼ y ð x (cid:3)(cid:4) ð t Þ , t Þ : ð 2 : 11 Þ Differentiating ( 2 . 11 ) 2 with respect to time and using ( 2 . 10 ) gives the jump condition l þ(cid:4) _ x (cid:4) þ v þ(cid:4) ¼ l (cid:3)(cid:4) _ x (cid:4) þ v (cid:3)(cid:4) : ð 2 : 12 Þ To complete the description of the boundary - initial value problem , it remains to specify the traction stress field b ( x , t ) ; the mechanical boundary conditions for σ 1 ( t ) and σ 0 ( t ) ; the chemo - mechanical boundary conditions describing the evolution of x 1 ( t ) , x 0 ( t ) and x (cid:4) ð t Þ via the kinetics of polymer - ization , depolymerization and hydrolysis ; and the initial conditions . 2 2 . 2 . Traction stress ( body force ) The traction stress field b ( x , t ) arises from the interaction between the actin network within the cell and the substrate outside it . Imagine a row of springs , each of which is lamellum trailing ( minus ) end y 0 ( t ) y 1 ( t ) y * ( t ) ( t ) lamellipodium leading ( plus ) end cell motion 0 ( t ) 1 ( t ) Figure 1 . A cartoon of the cell in the current configuration based on Bayly et al . [ 14 ] . The cell body is at the rear with the lamellipodium and lamellum protruding forward in the direction of motion . In the current configuration at time t , the leading and trailing edges of the actin network are at y 1 ( t ) and y 0 ( t ) , respectively , and the interface between the lamellum and lamellipodium is at y (cid:4) ð t Þ . The corresponding quantities in the reference configuration are x 1 ( t ) , x 0 ( t ) and x (cid:4) ð t Þ . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s i f J . R . S o c . I n t e r f a c e 21 : 20230543 4 connected at one end to a point on the stationary substrate , and at the other to a material point on the moving actin net - work . As the network moves , each spring stretches and so applies an opposing force on the network . Thus the retro - grade motion of the actin network , v ( x , t ) < 0 , results in a forward pointing force distribution over its length , i . e . a traction stress field b ( x , t ) > 0 . We shall adopt a purely phe - nomenological model describing how b depends on v . In the careful and detailed experiments of Waterman and colleagues on which this model is based , they do investigate the role of the underlying molecular processes by which the ‘ springs ’ , focal adhesions mediated by clutch molecules , attach and detach the network to the substrate giving rise to b ( see [ 21 ] ) . Further justification is provided by micromechanical modelling as mentioned in § 1 . 4 . We restrict attention to the case of a rigid substrate . An additional coupled mechanics problem for the substrate would have to be solved as in , for example , Zhang et al . [ 10 ] if the substrate is deformable . Based on their experiments in [ 21 ] , Gardel et al . conclude that the traction stress b is a biphasic function of the retrograde speed | v | : as | v | increases , the traction stress first increases ( the ‘ low - | v | phase ’ ) and then , when | v | exceeds some criti - cal value u (cid:4) , the traction stress decreases ( the ‘ high - | v | phase ’ ) ; see figs 1G , 3A , 4C and 5H in [ 21 ] . Thus b ð x , t Þ ¼ b b ð v ð x , t ÞÞ , ð 2 : 13 Þ where in our model , we describe the biphasic function b b by two straight lines as depicted in figure 2 : the low - | v | branch rises linearly from ( u 0 , b 0 ) to ð u (cid:4) , b (cid:4) Þ and is defined by b b ð v Þ ¼ a 0 ð b (cid:4) Þ (cid:3) c 0 ð b (cid:4) Þ v for u 0 (cid:5) j v j (cid:5) u (cid:4) , ð 2 : 14 Þ where a 0 ð b (cid:4) Þ : ¼ b 0 u (cid:4) (cid:3) b (cid:4) u 0 u (cid:4) (cid:3) u 0 and c 0 ð b (cid:4) Þ : ¼ b (cid:4) (cid:3) b 0 u (cid:4) (cid:3) u 0 . 0 ; ð 2 : 15 Þ the high - | v | branch declines linearly from ð u (cid:4) , b (cid:4) Þ to ( u 1 , b 1 ) and is described by b b ð v Þ ¼ a 1 ð b (cid:4) Þ þ c 1 ð b (cid:4) Þ v for u (cid:4) (cid:5) j v j (cid:5) u 1 , ð 2 : 16 Þ where a 1 ð b (cid:4) Þ : ¼ b (cid:4) u 1 (cid:3) b 1 u (cid:4) u 1 (cid:3) u (cid:4) . 0 and c 1 ð b (cid:4) Þ : ¼ b (cid:4) (cid:3) b 1 u 1 (cid:3) u (cid:4) . 0 : ð 2 : 17 Þ The parameters u 0 , u (cid:4) , u 1 , b 0 , b 1 , b (cid:4) define the function b b ; they are non - negative with 0 (cid:5) u 0 , u (cid:4) , u 1 , 0 (cid:5) b 0 , b (cid:4) and 0 (cid:5) b 1 , b (cid:4) : ð 2 : 18 Þ Finally , Gardel et al . [ 21 ] point out that the retrograde speed is large in the lamellipodium and small in the lamel - lum . This suggests that the high - | v | phase is relevant on the lamellipodium ð x (cid:4) ð t Þ , x 1 ð t ÞÞ and the low - | v | phase on the lamellum ð x 0 ð t Þ , x (cid:4) ð t ÞÞ . Accordingly , based on ( 2 . 14 ) and ( 2 . 16 ) , we take the traction stress field to be b ð x , t Þ ¼ b b ð v ð x , t ÞÞ ¼ a 0 ð b (cid:4) Þ (cid:3) c 0 ð b (cid:4) Þ v ð x , t Þ for x 0 ð t Þ , x , x (cid:4) ð t Þ , a 1 ð b (cid:4) Þ þ c 1 ð b (cid:4) Þ v ð x , t Þ for x (cid:4) ð t Þ , x , x 1 ð t Þ : (cid:4) ð 2 : 19 Þ Since the lamellum is associated with the low - | v | phase , we must have u 0 (cid:5) j v ð x , t Þj (cid:5) u (cid:4) for x 0 ð t Þ (cid:5) x , x (cid:4) ð t Þ ; ð 2 : 20 Þ the corresponding condition for the lamellipodium associ - ated with the high - | v | phase is u (cid:4) (cid:5) j v ð x , t Þj (cid:5) u 1 for x (cid:4) ð t Þ , x (cid:5) x 1 ð t Þ : ð 2 : 21 Þ Note that the values of the respective rearward speeds j v ð x 0 , t Þj , j v ð x + (cid:4) , t Þj and | v ( x 1 , t ) | at the trailing edge , the lamellum / lamellipodium interface and the leading edge need not equal u 0 , u (cid:4) and u 1 ; it is only the phase segregation conditions ( 2 . 20 ) and ( 2 . 21 ) that must hold . In the analysis to follow , we will be interested in how var - ious characteristics associated with cell motion depend on the strength of the adhesion between the cell and the substrate , and we take the peak value b (cid:4) of the traction stress to be a measure of this . Thus , while we will use specific values for the other parameters , for b (cid:4) we will consider a range of values b min (cid:4) (cid:5) b (cid:4) (cid:5) b max (cid:4) . 2 . 3 . Mechanical boundary conditions Let σ 0 ( t ) = σ ( x 0 ( t ) , t ) and σ 1 ( t ) = σ ( x 1 ( t ) , t ) be the stress in the actin network at the trailing and leading edge , respectively , as depicted in figure 3 b . Figure 3 c shows a free - body diagram of a part of the cell membrane at the leading edge . The lamellipodium pushes on the membrane with a stress 3 − σ 1 and this is balanced by the membrane tension T . Figure 3 a depicts the trailing cell body and part of the membrane at the rear . The lamellum and membrane apply the stresses σ 0 and T while h 0 _ y 0 is the viscous drag between the cell rear and the substrate , _ y 0 being the cell speed at the rear and η 0 the viscosity coefficient . Based on the free - body diagrams in figure 3 a , c , we take the mechanical boundary condition at the trailing and lead - ing edges to be s 0 ð t Þ ¼ (cid:3) T ð t Þ þ h 0 _ y 0 ð t Þ , h 0 . 0 , ð 2 : 22 Þ b 0 b * b ( v ) (cid:2) v (cid:2) ˆ u 0 u 1 u * b 1 Figure 2 . Motivated by the experiments of Gardel et al . [ 21 ] , the traction stress is taken to be a biphasic function of the velocity that we assume to be piecewise linear . The rising , low - | v | phase is relevant on the lamellum , the falling , high - | v | phase on the lamellipodium . The horizontal axis is | v | since v defined by ( 2 . 3 ) 1 is positive when particles move to the right while in our setting v is negative because the actin network moves to the left . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s i f J .

Using ( 2 . 23 ) to eliminate T from ( 2 . 22 ) and ( 2 . 24 ) leads to h 0 _ y 0 ¼ s 0 (cid:3) s 1 ð 2 : 25 Þ and ‘ ¼ L (cid:3) s 1 k : ð 2 : 26 Þ The equation describing the equilibrium of the free - body dia - gram in figure 3 b is equivalent to that obtained by integrating the equilibrium equation ∂ σ / ∂ x + b = 0 from x 0 to x 1 . 2 . 4 . Chemo - mechanical boundary conditions : kinetics of polymerization , depolymerization and hydrolysis During cell locomotion , actin monomers continually attach to the leading edge of the actin polymer network through polymerization and detach from the network at the trailing edge through depolymerization . We idealize the sequence of events undergone by a typical actin monomer to be as fol - lows : a free ATP - actin monomer in the cell cytoplasm ( with chemical energy m FreeATP ) polymerizes onto the actin network at the leading edge x 1 ; the monomer is now bound to the actin network ( and its chemical energy is m Bound ATP ) . This bound ATP - actin monomer subsequently hydrolyses into ADP - actin ( after which its chemical energy is m BoundADP ) . We model this as happening when the monomer reaches the lamellum / lamellipodium interface x (cid:4) [ 27 ] . Finally , this ADP - actin monomer depolymerizes when it reaches the trail - ing edge x 0 and detaches from the network ( after which its chemical energy is m FreeADP ) ; the monomer is again free from the network . Assuming polymerization , hydrolysis and depolymerization to occur spontaneously in the absence of stress , we have m FreeATP . m BoundATP . m BoundADP . m FreeADP : ð 2 : 27 Þ A standard framework for describing the evolution of a general system undergoing an irreversible process is as fol - lows : one first calculates the associated dissipation ( entropy production ) rate . The resulting expression is typically of the form v 1 f 1 þ v 2 f 2 þ (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:6) þ v n f n , i . e . the sum of the products of various fluxes v k ( e . g . mass , heat , etc . ) and their conjugate driving forces f k . According to the theory of irreversible pro - cesses ( e . g . § § 14 - 2 , 14 - 3 of Callen [ 28 ] or § 14 . 3 . 1 of Kestin [ 29 ] ) , the evolution of the system is described by kinetic laws relating each flux v i to the driving forces f 1 , f 2 , . . . , f n , with each kinetic law v i ¼ V i ð f 1 , f 2 , . . . , f n Þ required to be consistent with the dissipation inequality . The specific func - tional form of each kinetic law will depend on the details of the system , with linear kinetic relations being the simplest and appropriate for describing systems that are not far from equilibrium . It is shown in the electronic supplementary material that the dissipation rate associated with the actin network is D ¼ f 1 _ x 1 (cid:3) f 0 _ x 0 þ f (cid:4) _ x (cid:4) (cid:7) 0 , ð 2 : 28 Þ where f 1 , f 0 and f (cid:4) are the driving forces at the leading edge , the trailing edge and the lamellum / lamellipodium interface : f 1 : ¼ s 1 l 1 (cid:3) W 1 þ Dm 1 , f 0 : ¼ s 0 l 0 (cid:3) W 0 þ Dm 0 and f (cid:4) : ¼ W þ(cid:4) (cid:3) W (cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:3) s (cid:4) ð l þ(cid:4) (cid:3) l (cid:3)(cid:4) Þ þ Dm (cid:4) : ) ð 2 : 29 Þ Here , W ( x , t ) denotes the elastic strain energy density of the actin network , W 1 and W 0 being its values at x 1 and x 0 , and W + (cid:4) its limiting values on the two sides of the lamellum / lamellipodium interface x + (cid:4) . Furthermore , we have set Dm 1 : ¼ m FreeATP (cid:3) m BoundATP . 0 , Dm 0 : ¼ m FreeADP (cid:3) m BoundADP , 0 and Dm (cid:4) : ¼ m BoundATP (cid:3) m BoundADP . 0 : ) ð 2 : 30 Þ The inequality in ( 2 . 28 ) is the dissipation inequality . According to ( 2 . 28 ) , the driving forces f 1 ð t Þ , f 0 ð t Þ and f (cid:4) ð t Þ are conjugate to the respective referential velocities 4 _ x 1 ð t Þ , (cid:3) _ x 0 ð t Þ and _ x (cid:4) ð t Þ that represent the polymerization / hydrolysis rates . As described above , the associated non - equilibrium processes are described by kinetic laws relating each flux to the driving forces . If we assume the kinetic laws to be local , e . g . the flux at x 0 depends only on the driving force at x 0 and not those at distant locations x 1 and x * , then the kinetic laws will read (cid:3) _ x 0 ð t Þ ¼ V 0 ð f 0 ð t ÞÞ , _ x 1 ð t Þ ¼ V 1 ð f 1 ð t ÞÞ and _ x (cid:4) ð t Þ ¼ V (cid:4) ð f (cid:4) ð t ÞÞ , ð 2 : 31 Þ where the functional forms of V 0 , V 1 and V (cid:4) depend on the underlying biochemical effects and will be nonlinear in general .

R . S o c . I n t e r f a c e 21 : 20230543 6 The simplest kinetic relations are the linear ones (cid:3) _ x 0 ¼ m 0 f 0 , _ x 1 ¼ m 1 f 1 and _ x (cid:4) ¼ m (cid:4) f (cid:4) , ð 2 : 33 Þ where the constant mobilities m 0 , m 1 , m (cid:4) are positive by the dissipation inequality . Such linear kinetic laws will be valid for relatively small departures from equilibrium . They are not a general representation of the actual nonlinear scenario inside cells because there are a myriad accessory proteins that regulate the dynamics and structure of actin within cells [ 3 , 27 ] . In particular , we have assumed that the hydrolysis of ATP - actin to ADP - actin occurs at x (cid:4) ( based on evidence in [ 27 ] ) , yet it is known that many other proteins ( such as myosin ) interact with actin and hydrolyse ATP to ADP . Even though non - constant mobilities m i can account for this to some extent , our formulation above is a rudimentary attempt to account for the effects of ATP hydrolysis and myosin contrac - tion on actin polymerization / depolymerization within a continuum model . In the lamellipodium , we have the stress – stretch relation ( 2 . 8 ) . Suppose therefore that the associated strain energy density is W = ( E 1 / 2 ) ( λ − 1 ) 2 . Then upon using ( 2 . 8 ) , we find sl (cid:3) W ¼ s þ 1 2 s 2 E 1 : ð 2 : 34 Þ Thus from ( 2 . 29 ) 1 and ( 2 . 34 ) , the driving force at the leading edge is f 1 ¼ s 1 þ 1 2 s 21 E 1 þ S 1 , where S 1 : ¼ Dm 1 . 0 : When combined with the kinetic relation _ x 1 ¼ m 1 f 1 , this gives s 1 E 1 ¼ (cid:3) 1 þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 (cid:3) 2 S 1 E 1 1 (cid:3) _ x 1 V 1 (cid:2) (cid:3) s having set V 1 : ¼ m 1 S 1 . 0 : ð 2 : 35 Þ We took the positive square root here so that it linearizes appropriately in the special case where the chemical effects dominate over the effects of the deformation , i . e . the network is approximately rigid in the sense that S 1 = E 1 (cid:8) 1 . In this case ( 2 . 35 ) approximates to s 1 S 1 8 (cid:3) 1 (cid:3) _ x 1 V 1 (cid:2) (cid:3) : ð 2 : 36 Þ Likewise in the lamellum , we have the stress – stretch myosin contractility relation ( 2 . 7 ) . Suppose therefore that the associated strain energy density is W = ( E 0 / 2 ) ( λ − 1 ) 2 . It then follows on using ( 2 . 7 ) that sl (cid:3) W ¼ s þ 1 2 s 2 E 0 (cid:3) 1 2 b 2 E 0 : ð 2 : 37 Þ Thus from ( 2 . 29 ) 2 and ( 2 . 9 ) the driving force at the trailing edge is f 0 ¼ s 0 þ 1 2 s 20 E 0 (cid:3) 1 2 b 20 E 0 (cid:3) S 0 ; where S 0 : ¼ (cid:3) Dm 0 . 0 : ð 2 : 38 Þ When this is combined with the kinetic relation _ x 0 ¼ (cid:3) m 0 f 0 , we find s 0 E 0 ¼ (cid:3) 1 þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 (cid:3) 2 S 0 E 0 _ x 0 V 0 (cid:3) 1 (cid:2) (cid:3) þ b 20 E 20 s having set V 0 : ¼ m 0 S 0 . 0 : ð 2 : 39 Þ Again we took the positive square root so that ( 2 . 39 ) linearizes appropriately in the special case S 0 = E 0 (cid:8) 1 : s 0 S 0 8 (cid:3) _ x 0 V 0 (cid:3) 1 (cid:2) (cid:3) : ð 2 : 40 Þ The presence of the term β 0 in ( 2 . 38 ) and ( 2 . 39 ) shows how our model accounts for the effect of myosin on depolymeriza - tion at the trailing edge . Finally at the lamellum / lamellipodium interface , we use ( 2 . 34 ) , ( 2 . 37 ) and ( 2 . 9 ) to calculate the driving force f (cid:4) ¼ (cid:3)ð s (cid:4) l þ(cid:4) (cid:3) W þ(cid:4) Þ þ ð s (cid:4) l (cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:3) W (cid:3)(cid:4) Þ þ Dm (cid:4) ¼ 1 2 1 E 0 (cid:3) 1 E 1 (cid:2) (cid:3) s 2 (cid:4) þ S (cid:4) , ð 2 : 41 Þ where S (cid:4) : ¼ Dm (cid:4) . 0 : ð 2 : 42 Þ When combined with the kinetic relation _ x (cid:4) ¼ m (cid:4) f (cid:4) , we obtain s (cid:4) S (cid:4) ¼ (cid:3) ﬃﬃﬃ 2 p ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ S (cid:4) = E 0 (cid:3) S (cid:4) = E 1 p _ x (cid:4) V (cid:4) (cid:3) 1 (cid:2) (cid:3) 1 = 2 having set V (cid:4) ¼ m (cid:4) S (cid:4) . 0 : ð 2 : 43 Þ We took the negative square root here so that s (cid:4) , 0 . Thus in summary , in our model , the kinetics of polymer - ization at the leading edge x 1 , depolymerization at the trailing edge x 0 and hydrolysis at x (cid:4) are described by ( 2 . 35 ) , ( 2 . 39 ) and ( 2 . 43 ) , respectively . The six parameters describing these relations are S 1 . 0 , V 1 . 0 , S 0 . 0 , V 0 . 0 , S (cid:4) . 0 , V (cid:4) . 0 , ð 2 : 44 Þ where the inequalities follow from ( 2 . 30 ) and the dissipation inequality ; the parameters S 0 , S 1 , S (cid:4) depend on the chemical energies , while V 0 , V 1 , V (cid:4) are associated also with the reac - tion rates . Schematic plots of these kinetic relations in the special case of steady state are shown in figure 4 . 3 . The model in steady state In steady state , the constant polymerization rate _ x 1 at the leading edge , the constant depolymerization rate _ x 0 at the trailing edge , and the constant hydrolysis rate _ x (cid:4) at the lamellum / lamellipodium interface are equal , and the actin cytoskeleton in the cell is said to be in a state of treadmilling . Let U ¼ _ x 0 ¼ _ x 1 ¼ _ x (cid:4) denote this common value . Then x 0 ð t Þ ¼ Ut , x (cid:4) ð t Þ ¼ Ut þ L 0 , x 1 ð t Þ ¼ Ut þ L , U . 0 , ð 3 : 1 Þ where L 0 ∈ ( 0 , L ) is the referential length of the lamellum and L ( defined in ( 2 . 2 ) 1 ) is the referential length of the cell . The refer - ential length of the lamellipodium is L 1 = L − L 0 . They are constants to be determined . Letting ξ = x − x 0 ( t ) = x − Ut denote a coordinate measured from the trailing edge , a steady motion is described by y ð x , t Þ ¼ e y ð j Þ þ V cell t , j ¼ x (cid:3) Ut , 0 (cid:5) j (cid:5) L : ð 3 : 2 Þ It follows from this and ( 2 . 1 ) that the respective positions of the trailing and leading edges in the current configuration are y 0 ð t Þ ¼ e y ð 0 Þ þ V cell t and y 1 ð t Þ ¼ e y ð L Þ þ V cell t whence _ y 0 ¼ _ y 1 ¼ V cell : ð 3 : 3 Þ r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s i f J .

The equilibrium equation ( 2 . 5 ) and the kinematic compat - ibility equation ( 2 . 4 ) reduce to s 0 þ b ¼ 0 and v 0 ¼ (cid:3) U l 0 : ð 3 : 6 Þ Observe that ( 3 . 6 ) 2 is automatically satisfied by ( 3 . 4 ) 2 . Since b > 0 it follows from ( 3 . 6 ) 1 that σ is a ( continuous ) decreasing function of ξ , so that in particular s 0 . s (cid:4) . s 1 . Of course , we require σ 1 < 0 in order to ensure from ( 2 . 23 ) that the mem - brane stress T is tensile . With regard to the particle velocity , we expect v ( ξ ) < 0 in keeping with the observation that the actin network undergoes retrograde motion .

We proceed as follows : first , we determine σ 0 , σ 1 and s (cid:4) ( in terms of the polymerization rate U ) from the kinetic laws ( 3 . 10 ) , ( 3 . 9 ) and ( 3 . 11 ) ; then we find the cell speed V cell from ( 3 . 7 ) and the cell length in the current configuration ℓ from ( 3 . 8 ) . The referential length L 1 of the lamellipodium can now be calculated from ( 4 . 15 ) . The corresponding length ℓ 1 in the current con - figuration is then found from ( 4 . 16 ) , the length ℓ 0 of the lamellum in the current configuration from ( 4 . 18 ) , and the length L 0 of the lamellum in the reference configuration from ( 4 . 8 ) . These are all now known in terms of the polymerization rate U . When these are substituted into ( 4 . 7 ) we have a single equation in which U is the only unknown . Once this equation has been solved ( numerically ) for U , all other quantities can be calculated as described above . 5 . Results and discussion The model involves the following parameters : elastic moduli E 0 and E 1 of the lamellum and lamellipodium ; maximum myosin contractility parameter β 0 ; traction stress parameters ð u 0 , b 0 Þ , ð u (cid:4) , b (cid:4) Þ , ð u 1 , b 1 Þ ; cell membrane stiffness k ; unstretched length of cell membrane L ; viscosity coefficient of the cell body η 0 ; depolymerization kinetic parameters at trailing edge V 0 , S 0 ; polymerization kinetic parameters at leading edge V 1 , S 1 ; and hydrolysis kinetic parameters at lamellum / lamellipodium interface V (cid:4) , S (cid:4) . The specific parameter values that we used are given below with explanations describing how we arrived at these values given in the electronic supplementary material . E 0 ¼ 30 (cid:9) 10 (cid:3) 2 pNnm (cid:3) 2 and E 1 ¼ 55 (cid:9) 10 (cid:3) 2 pNnm (cid:3) 2 ; b 0 ¼ 7 : 2 (cid:9) 10 (cid:3) 3 pNnm (cid:3) 2 ; b 0 ¼ 1 : 43 (cid:9) 10 (cid:3) 7 pNnm (cid:3) 3 and u 0 ¼ 0 ; b 1 ¼ 0 : 57 (cid:9) 10 (cid:3) 7 pNnm (cid:3) 3 and u 1 ¼ 27 : 5nms (cid:3) 1 ; u (cid:4) ¼ 8nms (cid:3) 1 ; k ¼ 5 : 7 (cid:9) 10 (cid:3) 4 pNnm (cid:3) 3 and L ¼ 10000nm ; h 0 ¼ 1 (cid:9) 10 (cid:3) 3 pNsnm (cid:3) 3 ; V 0 ¼ 47nms (cid:3) 1 and S 0 ¼ 1 : 06pNnm (cid:3) 2 ; V 1 ¼ 100nms (cid:3) 1 and S 1 ¼ 0 : 37pNnm (cid:3) 2 and V (cid:4) ¼ 51 : 875nms (cid:3) 1 and S (cid:4) ¼ 1 : 6pNnm (cid:3) 2 : One of our interests is in determining the effect of the adhesive - ness between the cell and the substrate and we use b (cid:4) ( the r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s i f J . R . S o c . I n t e r f a c e 21 : 20230543 9 maximum value of the traction stress ) as a measure of this . Thus we do not limit attention to one specific value for b (cid:4) and instead consider the following range of values : 3 : 0 (cid:9) 10 (cid:3) 7 pNnm (cid:3) 3 (cid:5) b (cid:4) (cid:5) 5 : 0 (cid:9) 10 (cid:3) 7 pNnm (cid:3) 3 : ð 5 : 1 Þ In figs 4C and 5A of Gardel et al . [ 21 ] , they report a peak traction stress of 60 Pa . This corresponds to b (cid:4) ¼ 60 = 175 (cid:9) 10 (cid:3) 6 8 3 : 5 (cid:9) 10 (cid:3) 7 pN nm (cid:3) 3 . As described in the second paragraph of § 4 . 5 , we first reduced the problem to a single nonlinear equation for the polymerization rate U of the actin cytoskeleton . This equation accounts for all the physics of the problem including the kin - etics of actin polymerization and depolymerization at the leading and trailing edges , the forces generated by myosin contractility and the biphasic traction stress versus retrograde speed relation known from experiments . This equation was solved using both MATHEMATICA 5 and MATLAB . The peak value b (cid:4) of the traction stress , a measure of the adhesion strength , was kept arbitrary in the range ( 5 . 1 ) . The solution U as a function of the adhesion strength b * is plotted in figure 5 a . The polymerization rate U decreases as b (cid:4) increases . It lies in the interval ( U min , U max ) as discussed previously in the context of figure 4 . Once the polymerization rate U has been determined , the values of all other quantities can then be calculated by back substituting the value of U as described in § 4 . 5 . The first of these is the cell speed V cell that is plotted as a function of the adhesion strength b * in figure 5 b . For the parameters used , V cell is in the range 8 . 8 – 10 . 2 nm s − 1 ( 0 . 5 – 0 . 6 μ m min − 1 ) which agrees very well with the speeds measured by Gupton et al . for epithelial cells ( see fig . 6 of [ 20 ] ) . Observe that the cell speed V cell increases with b (cid:4) ; this is expected since U decreases with increasing b (cid:4) ( figure 5 a ) while σ 1 increases and σ 0 decreases with increasing U according to ( 3 . 9 ) and ( 3 . 10 ) ; recall that η 0 V cell = σ 0 − σ 1 . Next , the retrograde speeds at the extremities of the lamel - lum ( v 0 and v (cid:3)(cid:4) ) and lamellipodium ( v þ(cid:4) and v 1 ) are plotted in figure 6 a . Observe that the retrograde speeds in the lamellum are about 6 nm s − 1 while those in the lamellipodium are about 23 nm s − 1 which are consistent with measured values in epi - thelial cells reported by Gardel et al . [ 21 ] . The magnitude of the retrograde speed decreases as the adhesion strength increases due to the increased resistance offered by the 52 . 95 53 . 00 53 . 05 53 . 10 po l y m e r i za ti on r a t e ( n m s – 1 ) ce ll s p ee d ( n m s – 1 ) U V cell ( a ) ( b ) 3 . 0 3 . 5 adhesion strength b * ( pN nm – 3 ) 4 . 0 4 . 5 5 . 0 × 10 – 7 adhesion strength b * ( pN nm – 3 ) × 10 – 7 8 . 5 9 . 0 9 . 5 10 . 0 3 . 0 3 . 5 4 . 0 4 . 5 5 . 0 Figure 5 .

[ 21 ] , the transition between the two branches of the biphasic traction stress occurs at a retrograde speed of 8 nm s − 1 for epithelial cells . Observe from figure 6 a that the retrograde speeds are greater than 8 nm s − 1 in the lamellipodium and less than 8 nm s − 1 in the lamellum , a feature that was built into our biphasic model by having taken u (cid:4) ¼ 8 nm s (cid:3) 1 . Finally , we note from the red horizontal lines in the figure that the retrograde speeds obey the phase segregation inequalities ( 2 . 20 ) and ( 2 . 21 ) which is necessary for our solution to be valid . Next , the retrograde speed field v ( ζ ) was calculated and plotted versus the travelling wave coordinate ζ ( see figure 6 b ) . Observe that for the particular value of b (cid:4) for which the figure is drawn , the retrograde speed in the lamellum is approximately constant at about 6 nm s − 1 while that in the lamellipodium is roughly constant at about 23 nm s − 1 in agreement with measurements in epithelial cells described in Gardel et al . [ 21 ] . This plot shows a velocity discontinuity at the interface between the lamellum and the lamellipodium . The interface in our model was assumed to be sharp , but in a cell it is smeared out over the so - called LP base . Gardel et al . [ 21 ] speak of a narrow zone in which the retrograde speed of the actin network rapidly goes from 23 nm s − 1 to 5 nm s − 1 . Thus our model captures this feature of the retrograde speed variation through the cell . The stretches λ 0 , l (cid:3)(cid:4) , l þ(cid:4) and λ 1 ( at the extremities of the lamellum and lamellipodium ) are shown as functions of b * in figure 7 a . All these stretches are less than 1 , meaning the actin network has undergone contraction along the length of the cell . This is an important prediction of our model because the stretches ( or strains ) of the actin cytoskeleton can be visualized by fluorescent labelling in experiments . The stretch field λ ( ζ ) is plotted versus ζ in figure 7 b for a par - ticular value of b (cid:4) ; it has features similar to those of the retrograde velocity field in figure 6 b . The stresses σ 0 , σ * and σ 1 are plotted versus b (cid:4) in figure 8 a . The stresses are all negative indicating that the actin cyto - skeleton is under compression over the entire cell . Also s 0 . s (cid:4) . s 1 as is necessary for the validity of our solution ; see figure 4 and the discussion related to it .

I n t e r f a c e 21 : 20230543 11 observe that the lamellipodium is under greater compressive stress ( magnitude ) than the lamellum even though , according to the blue curves in figure 7 a , the lamellum undergoes the greater contraction in length . This is due to the contractile effect of the myosin on the lamellum . Finally , in figure 8 b , the cell length ℓ , lamellipodium length ℓ 1 and lamellum length ℓ 0 in the current configuration are shown as a function of the adhesion strength b * . For all values of b * , the lamellum is longer than the lamellipodium , but the length of the lamellipodium increases as b * increases . This again is a prediction of our model that can be tested in experiments . 6 . Conclusion In this paper , we constructed a one - dimensional continuum mechanical model of the locomotion of motile epithelial cells on a rigid substrate . It takes account of the elasticity of the actin network in addition to the effects of myosin contraction , ATP hydrolysis and the treadmilling of the actin . The kinetic relations used are the simplest ones based on the theory of irre - versible processes , being linear relations between the driving forces and reaction rates . The model captures the variation of actin retrograde speed in the lamellum and lamellipodium and correctly predicts cell speeds for reasonable values of the traction stress exerted by adhesions . It also predicts the state of strain in the actin network of the lamellum and lamel - lipodium and the changes in their lengths as a function of adhesive strength . These are falsifiable predictions of our model that can inspire future experiments . Data accessibility .
