Summary Cellular adhesion and motility are fundamental processes in biological systems such as morphogenesis and tissue homeostasis . During these processes , cells heav - ily rely on the ability to deform and supply plasma membrane from pre - existing membrane reservoirs , allowing the cell to cope with substantial morphological changes . While morphological changes during single cell adhesion and spreading are well characterized , the accompanying alterations in cellular mechanics are scarcely addressed . Using the atomic force microscope , we measured changes in cortical and plasma membrane mechanics during the transition from early adhesion to a fully spread cell . During the initial adhesion step , we found that tre - mendous changes occur in cortical and membrane tension as well as in membrane area . Monitoring the spreading progress by means of force measurements over 2 . 5 h reveals that cortical and membrane tension become constant at the expense of excess membrane area . This was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy , which shows a rougher plasma membrane of cells in suspension compared with spread ones , allowing the cell to draw excess membrane from reservoirs such as invaginations or protrusions while attaching to the substrate and forming a first contact zone . Concretely , we found that cell spreading is initiated by a transient drop in tension , which is compensated by a decrease in excess area . Finally , all mechanical parameters become almost constant although morphological changes continue .

Introduction Cellular adhesion and motility are fundamental for biological processes such as morphogenesis , wound healing and tissue homeostasis . For instance , lympho - cytes migrating through an intact cellular layer rely on the ability to adhere and move through tissue [ 1 ] . Sahai & Marshall [ 2 ] report that tumour melanoma cells produce dynamic blebs , which allow migration through a three - dimensional matrix . Experience from these studies clearly shows that cellular deformation and supply of excess membrane are key factors for the above - mentioned processes . While the morphological changes taking place during spreading of cells to a sub - strate or matrix are well known and characterized for many different cell lines , comprehensive studies of the accompanying changes in cell mechanics are scarce , although it is known that membrane tension and cell motility are strongly interwoven [ 3 ] . Generally , the spreading process can be divided into three phases [ 4 , 5 ] . The first phase is characterized by the formation of initial bonds between adhesion molecules and molecules of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . This is followed by the second phase , comprising the initial cell spreading , which is & 2013 The Authors .

Blebs are characteristics not only of apopto - sis [ 6 ] and cell division [ 7 ] , but also for cell spreading [ 8 ] . Cells in suspension frequently display blebs , which originate from a drop in tension due to local disassemblyof the actin cortex . The same is formed upon detachment of an adhered cell . These membrane protrusions appear transiently only during the spreading progress and vanish at a later stage [ 8 ] . After the depletion of this membrane reservoir , the cells enter the third spreading phase , whereby additional plasma membrane is recruited from internally stored membrane buffer ( i . e . excess area ) [ 9 ] . The various stages are accompanied by substantial changes in cellular mechanics to accommodate the mechanical challenges posed by spreading and migration . In particular , volume changes pose a substantial threat to membrane integ - rity due to the lateral inextensibility of the membrane , which does not allow for area dilation beyond a few per cent [ 10 ] . Here , we study the mechanics of cell spreading on a surface as a paradigm for the close relationship between cell shape and membrane mechanics . Spreading of a cell is an F - actin - depen - dent process as cells spread very slowly after disruption of the actin cytoskeleton [ 11 ] , whereas the plasma membrane under - goes a mechanical deformation from a spherical shape to a nearlydiscoidalmorphologypromotingtheideathatmembrane mechanics ( i . e . the membrane’s in - plane tension ) , participate in cell spreading regulation . Stretching an epithelial cell causes the cell to sacrifice lateral protrusions , whereas suppression of spreading activity is reversed upon release of tension [ 12 ] . Raucher & Sheetz [ 13 ] reported that chemically induced reduction of membrane tension leads to faster lamellipodial extension . This suggeststhat theplasmamembraneacts as a reg - ulator of cell spreading through tension homeostasis , limiting the number of protrusions owing to exhaustion of membrane reservoirs . Indentation experiments combined with site - specific pulling of membrane tethers , both carried out with the atomic force microscope ( AFM ) at the same spot , allowed us to assess simultaneously local changes in membrane tension , cortical ten - sion and excess area during the spreading of epithelial cells . During adhesion and spreading , the shape of a suspended cell changes from a sphere to a capped sphere . Cell shape changes were taken into account byadjusting the geometrical constraints ofatension model describing thecell as a liquid - filled bodywith an isotropic in - plane tension [ 14 , 15 ] . These experiments are sup - ported by fluorescence microscopy of the plasma membrane as well as visualization of F - actin of adhering and spreading cells . Administration of toxinstargeting cytoskeletal integrities , mem - brane tension and surface area availability confirms that the process of spreading is not very robust and is easily perturbed . We were able to show that the adhesion and spreading leads to a remarkable and dynamic change in the mechanical proper - ties of the cell , and that cells regulate and restore changes in membrane tension during adhesion and spreading by adapting their excess surface area accordingly . 3 . Results and discussion 3 . 1 . Changes in the cellular mechanics during cell spreading : model - free characterization We monitored the mechanical behaviour of a spreading MDCK II cell as a function of time , using force measurements to characterize this process in terms of varying membrane tension and concomitant surface arearegulation ( figure 1 a ) . Indentation of a cell with an AFM tip provides force versus tip – sample - separation curves ( FC ) . Generally , a larger slope corresponds to a stiffer cell . Figure 1 b , c shows a shift in the slope of FCs taken on a single cell during adhesion and spreading , which is generally observed in all experiments ( 3 / 3 ) . The first FC is taken 5 min after cell seeding on the centre of the cell body , with an indentation depth of 1 m m to reach the given set point of 1 nN normal force . Five minutes later , we observe a tre - mendous decrease in the slope of the FC corresponding to a considerable softening of the cell , mirrored in an increased indentation depth of 3 m m . Following the spreading process over the next 3 h reveals a reversal of the slope towards its initial value ( i . e . the cell body becomes stiffer again ; figure 1 b , c ) . Even without an appropriate mechanical model of the cell , a change in the slope is indicative of a substantial but also reversible change in the cell’s stiffness during spreading . A higher inden - tation depth at constant force could be reached only if the cells soften , or , more precisely , if the cells obtain access to a mem - brane reservoir . The latter would allow compensation for the stress exerted by the indenter . This initial softening is followed by a gradual increase in cell stiffness towards a constant value ( more than 20 min ) . Simultaneously , we record optical phase contrast images to concomitantly follow cell shape changes during adhesion and spreading ( figure 1 d ) . Figure 1 e shows the time course of the spreading area obtained from data analy - sis of the optical micrographs . Within the first 40 min , the contact area increases linearly . Cells in suspension exhibit a spherical shape , frequently dis - playing blebs ( figure 1 d , 5 min ; figure 2 e , arrows ) . Moreover , when suspended cells are treated with F - actin - destabilizing cytochalasin D , cells show a considerable increase in the membrane outgrowths ( figure 2 f ) . First , significant cell shape changes can be observed after 10 min , where spherical mem - brane protrusions become visible , forming the initial substrate adhesion area . This initial adhesion phase is followed by a sub - stantialincrease inadhesionarea ( 20 – 30 min ) , whichwe referto as the initial spreading phase . The dynamics of cell spreading has been studied for many cell lines , drawing a comprehensive picture of this process . Bereiter - Hahn and co - workers [ 16 ] showed that the initial phase is characterized by the attachment of the cell to the substrate , forming a broad and smooth contact area ( within the first 10 min ) followed by a broadening of the adhesion zone through cytoplasmic flow . The final phase in cell spreading is characterized by the extension of lamellae [ 16 ] . Observing the spreading area over time , Norman et al . [ 8 ] found that the contact area remains constant after 40 – 60 min . We observe a similar time - dependent spreading behaviour for MDCK II cells , leading to the chronological sequence illustrated in figure 1 a . The next step in describing the mechanicalresponse is to devise an appropriate model of the cell that not only cap - tures the essential mechanical features encompassing tension , areacompressibilityandsurfacearea , butalsotakesintoaccount morphological changes . The cell shape needs to be considered carefullyasitbearsimportantinputparametersforanymechan - ical model . Otherwise , changes in cell shape might falsely be attributed to changes in the mechanical parameters [ 17 ] . 3 . 2 . Mechanical model The mechanical model used to describe force indentation experiments of cells in the context of a single spreading cell r s o b . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g O p e n B i o l 3 : 130084 2 relies on the assumption that the restoring force in response to indentation originates mainly from a constant isotropic tension T , comprising the sum of cortical and membrane ten - sion T 0 and a term describing the stretching or area dilatation of the bilayer [ 15 ] : T ¼ T 0 þ K A D A A 0 ; ð 3 : 1 Þ where D A denotes the change in surface area related to the initial surface area of the cell A 0 and K A denotes the area com - pressibility modulus of the plasma membrane in conjunction with the cortex . Because the area compressibility modulus K A of a lipid bilayer is usually in the range of 0 . 1 – 1 N m 2 1 , depending on the lipid composition in comparison with the rather large compliance of the actin cortex ( K cA approx . 0 . 001 N m 2 1 ) , bilayer mechanics and resistance to stretching dominate the response to large strains [ 18 ] . Concretely , assuming a typical thickness of the cortex in the range of 1 m m and a Young’s modulus of 1 kPa , we arrive at a K cA of about 0 . 001 N m 2 1 , which is more than two orders of magni - tude lower than the K A of a fluid lipid bilayer . The large value for K A is due to the liquid – crystalline nature of the bilayer giving rise to a lateral inextensibility ( i . e . the bilayer already ruptures at D A / A 0 (cid:2) 2 – 3 % ) . At small strains , however , the overall tension T 0 dominates the mechanical response . T 0 comprises the active cortical tension T c , [ 19 , 20 ] generated by active contraction of the actomyosin cortex , and the mem - brane tension T t that encompasses membrane’s in - plane tension g m and the tension resulting from cytoskeleton – membrane attachment sites g ad : T 0 ¼ T c þ T t ð 3 : 2 Þ and T t ¼ g m þ g ad : ð 3 : 3 Þ The real surface area of the cell is usually considerably larger than the geometrical one ( A 0 ) due to wrinkles and folds of the membrane on smaller length scales . Therefore , the area com - pressibility modulus needs to be replaced by the so - called apparent area compressibility modulus ~ K A : ~ K A ¼ K A A 0 A 0 þ A ex ; ð 3 : 4 Þ where ~ K A is usually smaller than K A due to the presence of excess membrane area leading to an apparent reduction of K A . Therefore , smaller K A values correspond to a large sur - face excess . In order to describe the mechanics of the cells with this tension model , it is important to compute the cor - rect shape of cells during indentation . Here , we choose for the initial spreading phase a model described by Rosenbluth et al . [ 14 ] where the cell is treated as an unperturbed sphere ( radius R c ) prior to indentation ( figure 2 a ) .

Mechanical properties of MDCK II cell during adhesion and spreading . ( a ) Scheme illustrating the adhesion and spreading process . The adhering and spreading cell is locally indented with an AFM tip , resulting in force curves shown exemplarily in ( b ) . While retracting the cantilever , a membrane nanotube ( tether ) is frequently pulled out of the plasma membrane , bearing additional mechanical information ( equation ( 3 . 7 ) ) . ( b ) Representative force curves taken at different time points during cell spreading .

The force experienced by a conical indenter amounts to F ¼ 2 p T ð d t tan a Þ 2 ð R (cid:2) 1 c þ ð d t tan a Þ (cid:2) 1 Þ ; ð 3 : 5 Þ with d ¼ d t þ R c (cid:2) ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ R 2 c (cid:2) ð d t tan a Þ 2 q ; ð 3 : 6 Þ where T denotes the isotropic lateral tension , d t is the height of the cone immersed in the cell with an opening angle a and d denotes the overall indentation depth ( see electronic supplementary material , figure S1 ) . Notably , T is also a function of the indentation depth because it depends on the area dilatation ( equation ( 3 . 1 ) ) . Fifteen minutes after adhesion , we switch to a model first described by Discher and co - workers [ 15 ] , who compute the exact cell shape starting from a spherical cap ( figure 2 b ) . The cell shape is obtained from the radius of the contact zone R i and the wetting angle f , as illustrated in figure 2 b assuming constant curvature at a given indentation depth and constant volume as boundary conditions [ 21 ] . Cell indentation experiments are accompanied and veri - fied by tether - pulling experiments carried out on the same spot . Tether pulling represents an independent mechanical approach for probing membrane properties . Upon retraction of the tip , adhesion permits a formation of a membrane nano - tube containing only cytoplasma . Membrane tension contains contributions from membrane – cytoskeleton attachment g ad , the contraction of the actomyosin cortex as well as tension in the bilayer itself g m [ 22 ] . Tether formation is characterized in FC ( retraction ) by a force plateau followed by a sudden release of force to zero owing to tether rupture , if the membrane reservoir is exhausted . This drop in force is called the tether force F t ( figure 2 d ) . During tether formation , additional membrane material from pre - existing reservoirs is flowing into the growing tether . The force on the tether is directly connected to membrane tension T t and bending rigidity k of the membrane [ 17 – 20 ] : F t ¼ 2 p ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 k T t p : ð 3 : 7 Þ Therefore , we functionalized AFM tips with concanavalin A , providing enough adhesion to extract membrane nanotubes more frequently from the apical membrane than non - specific interaction would allow ( figure 1 a ) . In summary , the extrac - tion of tethers allows us to determine the membrane tension separately from indentation experiments . Together with equation ( 3 . 2 ) , we obtain access to T c and T t , as well as ~ K A mirroring the excess surface area . 3 . 3 .

This is followed by an increase in ~ K A , which levels off to an almost constant modulus of ( 0 . 05 + 0 . 02 ) N m 2 1 . At the same time , we detect a decrease in the membrane tension T 0 from an initial value of ( 0 . 29 + 0 . 06 ) mN m 2 1 to ( 0 . 13 + 0 . 04 ) mN m 2 1 ( figure 3 b ) . After this relaxation ( 15 min ) , the tension recovers to an almost constant value of ( 0 . 6 + 0 . 05 ) mN m 2 1 . The tension T t determined fromtether pulling also decreases within the first 30 min of adhesion and spreading from ( 0 . 19 + 0 . 01 ) to ( 0 . 06 + 0 . 05 ) mN m 2 1 . After this initial drop , T t eventually increases to a final value of ( 0 . 14 + 0 . 04 ) mN m 2 1 . Both mechanical measurements ( indentation andtether pulling ) revealthesametrendintension—firstadecrease , followedbyan increase , and eventually a constant value . Using equation ( 3 . 2 ) allows us to compute cortical tension from T 0 and T t . Interest - ingly , we found that T c is initially close to zero but increases within 30 min to reach a plateau ( T c (cid:2) 0 . 44 + 0 . 04 mN m 2 1 ) . This is in accordance with findings of Arthur & Burridge [ 23 ] , who also report a first loss of contraction between 10 and 30 min after seeding , to allow for spreading followed bya recov - ery of contractility . After 40 – 50 min , cortical tension dominates the mechanical response to small strains . Further spreading and polarization of a single cell ( 24 h ) does not change tension any more . Finally , we obtain from indentation experiments a T 0 value of 0 . 6 mN m 2 1 and from tether pulling a T t value of 0 . 14 mN m 2 1 . 3 . 4 . Spherical cell : initial adhesion prior to spreading MDCK II cells in suspension frequently display membrane protrusions that are lined with actin filaments ( see electronic supplementary material , figure S2 ) . Therefore , size and growth dynamics depend on cortical tension [ 20 ] . A sudden drop in tension , as it occurs upon detachment of an adherent cell , nucleates formation of protrusions , probably due to the contractile nature of the actomyosin cortex that restores ten - sion in the plasma membrane through increase in internal pressure . The overall tension of the plasma membrane is a result of contributions from in - plane tension of the lipid bilayer , molecular adhesion of the plasma membrane to the underlying actin – cytoskeleton [ 24 ] and an active contri - bution from the contractile actomyosin cortex [ 25 , 26 ] . When membrane tension is chemically decreased , faster lamellipo - dial extension in spreading cells is observed , supporting the idea that cell membrane mechanics play an important role in controlling membrane protrusions , and therefore spreading [ 13 ] . Although the membrane of a spherical cell displays a rougher , more corrugated surface than a cell after adhesion and spreading ( figure 4 ) , the apparent area compressibility modulus ~ K A measured 5 min after cell seeding shows a value of 0 . 19 N m 2 1 , essentially identical with a neat lipid bilayer in the absence of a buffering membrane reservoir . The area compressibility modulus of pure lipid bilayers and cell membranes is in the range of 0 . 1 – 1 N m 2 1 , depending on their composition [ 18 , 13 ] . Cells with such high K A values obviously possess a negligible amount of excess mem - brane area A ex . This confirms that a cell in its spherical state has no access to excess membrane at large strains , and there - fore appears stiff . This is also supported by the large forces required to pull tethers from cells in the spherical state . High tether forces suggest a stronger membrane binding to the underlying cortex . In order to provide additional evidence for our model , we labelled the F - actin in these spherical cells ( see electronic supplementary material , figure S2 a ) displaying a uniform cortex . The blebs or protrusions occurring in the initial stage after adhering are therefore lined with actin filaments . This continuous and rigid actin cortex provides resistance to mechanical forces , and therefore protection against damage .

First and second phase of cell spreading : adhesion results in tension loss Within 10 min after seeding , cells adhere to the substrate by the formation of an initial adhesion zone [ 13 ] . Exactly at this time , we detect a relaxation in tension and simultaneously a sudden increase in the available membrane area . This is reflected by a lower area compressibility module ~ K A compared with the value of a lipid bilayer . The decrease in ~ K A corresponds to an increase in excess membrane area by a factor of 12 ( equation ( 3 . 4 ) ) . Additionally , we observe a disruption of the F - actin layer in the basal area of an adhering cell ( see electronic sup - plementary material , figure S2 , arrow ) accompanied by a reduction in membrane tension ( figure 3 b , c ) , confirming a weakening of F - actin that supports the membrane . This tem - porary release in tension enables the cell to spread on the substrate by forming membrane protrusions , also visible in light microscopy ( figure 1 d ) and fluorescence micrographs ( figure 4 b ) as large spherical extensions ( blebs ) in the lower part of the cell . The breakdown of the F - actin cortex is followed by a bulk flow of cytoplasm , causing blebs to protrude , which allows spreading on the surface [ 16 ] . The nucleation of a mem - brane bleb is provoked by a local weakening of the cortical complex and promoted by the internal pressure of the cell gen - erated by the contractile actomyosin cortex [ 13 , 20 , 27 ] . The drop in tension causes the change from a static and rigid to a more dynamic actin cortex that allows spreading by drawing additional membrane from reservoirs stored in protrusions , invaginations or internal membrane structures [ 23 , 28 ] . Ren and co - workers [ 29 ] observed a decrease in Rho activity when suspended cells adhere to a matrix . Rho regulatesthe for - mation of actin stress fibres [ 30 ] and integrin signalling [ 31 ] . Upon inhibition of Rho , the cortical F - actin network is partly disrupted , thereby allowing integrins to be clustered , which are otherwise dispersed over the cell surface in a suspended cell [ 32 , 33 ] . This allows the cell to initially adhere and finally to spread . We therefore attribute the decrease in tension and increase in excess membrane area to a breakdown of the cortical F - actin in the basal part of the cell , causing membrane material to protrude at these defects , which eventually form the initial adhesion zone . 3 . 6 . Inhibition of adhesion abolishes tension drop The adhesion of a spherical cell to the substrate leads to a release of tension and recruitment of excess membrane area . If this hypothesis is correct , then the inhibition of adhesion should prevent a change of mechanical parameters that mirror this process . Hence , we investigated the behaviour of an MDCK II cell in suspension by coating the substrate with bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , therefore abolishing cellular adhesion to a large extent [ 34 ] . While challenging the cells mechanically ( figure 5 a , b ) , no specific cellular adhesion to the substrate is seen . In addition , the barely adhering cells display many protrusions empha - sizing that they are arrested in the state of initial adhesion ( figure 5 c , d ) . Figure 5 a shows FCs taken continuously on a non - adhering spherical MDCK II cell . Most importantly , no change in the slope of recorded FCs over a time period of more than 30 min is seen , and the indentation depth does not exceed 1 m m . Comparing these data with the slope of an FC taken 10 min after cell seeding on an untreated substrate ( grey diamonds in figure 5 a ) , it becomes evident that neither adhesion nor spreading of spherical cells occurs on a BSA - coated substrate . While the slope of the force curves recorded on cells seeded on untreated surfaces drops in the first 10 min ( figure 5 b , grey ) , no change in slope or morphology is found for cells on BSA - coated surface . In terms of mechanical parameters , the cells on BSA - coated surfaces are stiff spheres with no excess area ( ~ K A ¼ ( 0 . 58 + 0 . 34 ) mN m 2 1 ) and domi - nated by cortical tension ( T c ¼ ( 0 . 33 + 0 . 16 ) mN m 2 1 ) , whereas membrane tension ( T t ¼ ( 0 . 07 + 0 . 03 ) mN m 2 1 ) is A1 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) A2 B1 B2 C1 C2 Figure 4 .

In contrast to adhering cells displaying the same mor - phology in the early stage of adhesion that also possess a large ~ K A , cortical tension is already substantially reduced . We attribute this to an early stage of mechanotransduction , occur - ring only on adhesive substrates in which tension release is important to allow further adhesion and spreading of the cell . This supports our picture that the adhesion process is accompanied by a characteristic change in tension and surface area , marked by an initial drop in tension followed by slow restoration of the initial tension . We also performed chemical perturbation experiments on spreading cells by decreasing membrane tension with deoxy - cholate [ 13 ] , destroying the actin cortex by administration of cytochalasin D and interfering with surface area regulation by using dynasore [ 35 ] . Interesting , all treatments led to a substantial perturbation of the spreading behaviour . Figure 3 ( blue dots ) shows the impact of cytochalasin D on spreading dynamics and mechanics . As expected , spreading and adhesion are hampered considerably , if the F - actin is dis - assembled . All mechanical parameters display a strong reduction , particularly those associated with an intact cyto - skeleton . Cortical tension T c is close to zero and membrane tension declines—the contribution from g ad is obviously lost . The value for the apparent area compressibility modulus after administration of cytochalasin D remains at low values ( approx . 0 . 02 N m 2 1 ) , which we explain with a large surface excess owing to loss of cytoskeleton integrity . The cells are not able to regulate the membrane surface area without an intact F - actin cytoskeleton , which is also observable in figure 2 f , where abnormal membrane outgrowths are visible . Membrane tension can be decreased by addition of deter - gents , organic solvents or local anaesthetics . We have investigated cell adhesion and spreading after administration of deoxycholate to reduce membrane tension ( see electronic supplementary material , figure S3 ) . Additionally , we observe neither adhesion nor spreading over a time period of more than 1 h . Indentation experiments on suspended cells treated with deoxycholate display an increase in indentation depth ( approx . 2 m m ) , indicating softening due to decrease of membrane tension ( see electronic supplementary material , figure S3 a , grey ) . An appropriate geometrical description of the cellular shape , which is essential for applying a mechanical model , was not feasible for the blebbing cells . Therefore , we pulled membrane tethers to find a decrease in membrane ten - sion T t ¼ ( 0 . 03 + 0 . 01 ) mN m 2 1 compared with untreated cells ( T t (cid:2) 0 . 2 + 0 . 01 mN m 2 1 ) . This is in accordance with findings of Raucher and Sheetz [ 13 ] , who treated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with deoxycholate . The authors report an increase in the rate of lamellipodial extension and a decrease of tether forces by a factor of 2 . In contrast , suspended MDCK II cells treated with dyna - sore display no blebs , and the cell surface appears smooth ( see electronic supplementary material , figure S4 c ) . Because dynasore inhibits dynamin - dependent endocytosis , this treat - ment should strongly interfere with surface area regulation of the cells . Perturbation of surface area regulation should have a negative impact on the adhesion and spreading process . Indeed , we observe a slowing down of the spreading rate . First , adhesion to the substrate is detectable only after more than 1 h ( see electronic supplementary material , figure S4 d ) . Moreover , the apparent area compressibility modulus remains almost constant ( approx . 0 . 2 N m 2 1 ; electronic sup - plementary material , figure S4 a ) , which is indicative of a failing of surface area regulation due to the administration of dynasore . Simultaneously , neither cortical nor membrane tension ( T 0 (cid:2) 0 . 3 mN m 2 1 , T t (cid:2) 0 . 1 mN m 2 1 ) changes over time . In summary , cells treated with dynasore show a per - turbed area regulation and stay arrested in an initial stage with constant mechanical parameters . Taken together , we observe in all three experiments ( addition of dynasore , deoxycholate , passivation with BSA ) that the initial drop in tension and availability of excess membrane is a prerequisite for unperturbed adhesion and spreading of MDCK II cells . 3 . 7 . Third phase of cell spreading After adhesion and subsequent formation of membrane pro - trusions to enable spreading , the substrate adhesion zone of the cell increases . At the same time , membrane protrusions , invaginations and blebs are smoothed out . Figure 4 shows membrane staining of MDCK II cells during the adhesion and spreading process . Comparing the membrane roughness of just adhered cell with a fully spread one reveals a reduction of membrane protrusions after spreading ( figure 4 a – c ) . This is in agreement with a study of Norman et al . , who describe that blebs disappear 30 – 40 min after seeding of cells [ 8 ] . While increasing the contact zone with the substrate by smoothing out membrane reservoirs , the apparent area com - pressibility modulus ~ K A increases accordingly , reaching an almost constant modulus of 0 . 05 N m 2 1 , which corresponds 1 . 0 ( a ) 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 f o r ce ( n N ) 0 . 2 0 0 1 dis t a nce ( m m ) 2 3 4 m i n 1 2 m i n 1 6 m i n 22 m i n 26 m i n 27 m i n 36 m i n 1 0 m i n w / o BS A 2 . 4 2 . 0 1 . 6 1 . 2 0 . 8 0 . 4 ( b ) s l op e ( n N m m – 1 ) 0 1 0 20 30 4 0 t ( m i n ) ( c ) ( d ) Figure 5 .

Simul - taneously , tension T 0 measured by indentation , as well as tether pulling , shows a recovery to about 0 . 37 mN m 2 1 ( figure 3 b , c ) , mainly governed by cortical tension ( figure 3 d ) . At this time , first stress fibres become visible , indicative of fully established adhesion to the substrate ( see electronic supplementary material , figure S2 ) . 4 . Conclusions By combining our results from mechanical probing and fluorescence microscopy , we propose a mechanical model for the adhesion and spreading of a suspended MDCK II cell that captures the various phases from initial contact to a firmly adhered cell . Upon initial contact with a surface , a suspended cell shows a decrease of membrane tension , causing the visible formation of membrane protrusions ( figure 6 a ) . Tension is subsequently restored ( figure 3 b – d ) by enclosing excess membrane into these actin - lined protrusions , reflected in a high area compressibility modulus close to that found for inextensible lipid bilayers mirroring absence of membrane reservoirs ( figures 3 a and 6 b ) . Adhesion to the substrate leads to a partial dissolution of the cortical actin and drop of tension , along with a marked increase in the excess membrane area ( factor of 12 ; figure 6 c ) . This is essential for the cell to spread by creating mem - brane protrusions originating from the basal part of the cell ( figure 6 d ) [ 36 ] . Therefore , we postulate that cells that are able to establish mechanical contact to the substrate by mol - ecular recognition events such as those between integrins and ECM [ 23 ] actively release tension of the cortex and mem - brane to permit recruitment of excess area stored in the membrane wrinkles and folds for further spreading . In the course of spreading , membrane tension increases again by smoothing out existing membrane reservoirs . After occur - rence of first stress , fibres’ cortical and membrane tension as well as surface area maintain a constant level , indicating full adhesion of the cell to the substrate . Perturbation of cytoskeleton integrity , membrane tension and surface area regulation immediately arrests the cell in its initially spherical state , abolishing spreading on the substrate . In conclusion , time - resolved mechanical probing of cellular elasticity of the spreading process reveals that cell spreading requires a transient release in tension to permit formation of membrane protrusions that , in turn , allows the cell to spread . It is concei - vable that a similar mechanism is responsible for the dynamic remodelling of the cytoskeleton during cell migration . 5 . Material and methods 5 . 1 . Cell culture MDCK II cells , obtained from the Health Protection Agency , Salisbury , UK , were maintained in minimal essential medium with Earle’s salts and 2 . 2 g l 2 1 NaHCO 3 ( Biochrom , Berlin , Germany ) supplemented with 4 mM L - glutamine , penicillin – streptomycin and 10 % FCS at 37 8 C in a 5 % CO 2 - humidified incubator . Confluent cells were released with trypsin / EDTA ( 0 . 5 % / 0 . 2 % ; Biochrom ) and subcultured weekly . For spreading studies , cells were trypsinized for 5 min and used within 30 min after detachment . 5 . 2 . Perturbation experiments We disrupted the actin cortex by exposing the suspended cells to cytochalasin D ( 10 m M ; Sigma - Aldrich , Steinheim , Germany ) for 15 min before seeding cells onto the Petri dish . To decrease membrane tension , we treated suspended cells with 0 . 4 mM deoxycholate ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30 min before cell seeding . We abolished endocytosis of suspended MDCK II cells by blocking dynamin with dynasore hydrate ( 100 m M ; Sigma - Aldrich ) 60 min before cell seeding . 5 . 3 . Cell labelling Cells in suspension were seeded on Ibidi Petri dishes ( Ibidi , Martinsried , Germany ) and incubated for different time intervals ( 5 , 15 , 30 min ) . Cells were fixed with 4 % paraformal - dehyde for 30 min . F - actin labelling was carried with Alexa 488 - phalloidin ( Invitrogen , Darmstadt , Germany ; diluted as recommended by the manufacturer , 5 m l methanolic stock solution with 200 m l dilution buffer for each coverslip ) . The dye was diluted in dilution buffer ( 1 % ( w / v ) BSA , 0 . 3 % ( w / v ) Triton - X 100 in phosphate - buffered saline , PBS ) , which also permeabilizes the cells .

( a ) Detachment of an adherent cell due to trypsinization . ( b ) Freshly detached cells restore tension by creating actin - coated protrusions that consume excess membrane to maintain tension . ( c ) Owing to adhesion to a surface , the actin cortex partially opens close to the substrate , allowing ( d ) a bulk flow of cytoplasma to cause blebs as an onset of spreading . ( e ) In the last step , cells start to flatten and the cell’s surface becomes smoother while stress fibres form . r s o b . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g O p e n B i o l 3 : 130084 8 living cells was carried out by incubating cells for 5 min with CellMask deep red plasma membrane staining solution ( 5 m g ml 2 1 ; Life Technology , Frankfurt , Germany ) at 37 8 C . Cells were fixed after staining as described above . Fluorescence imaging was carried out with fixed cell using an upright con - focal laser scanning microscope ( CLSM ; LSM710 , Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) equipped with a water immersion objective with 63 (cid:3) magnification . 5 . 4 . Phase contrast imaging during spreading The spreading process was observed on living MDCK II cells during the mechanical investigation on an Olympus IX 81 inverted light microscope equipped with long - distance phase contrast objective ( 40 (cid:3) magnification ) . 5 . 5 . Atomic force microscopy for elasticity measurements Force curves were recorded with a nanowizard II AFM ( JPK Instruments AG , Berlin , Germany ) mounted on an Olympus IX 81 inverted light microscope . MDCK II cells seeded on Ibidi Petri dishes were mounted in a Petri dish heater ( JPK Instruments ) set to 37 8 C with HEPES - buffered culture medium . Force curves were taken in the middle of a single cell with a cantilever having a nominal spring constant of 10 mN m 2 1 ( MLCT , Bruker AFM , Proes , Camarillo , CA , USA ) . The shape of the cell parametrized by the base radius and the contact angle was computed at each indenta - tion depth , which allowed us to fit ~ K A and T 0 to experimental force indentation models [ 15 ] . A home - made Matlab script using a simplex algorithm was used for this purpose . All measurements were recorded with a set point of 1 nN normal force and tip velocities of 2 m m s 2 1 . The opening angle a of the tip indenter was 17 . 5 8 , and the radius of the cell R c was set to 11 m m . Small variations in R c did not signifi - cantly affect the outcome of the fitting procedure . 5 . 6 . Atomic force microscopy for probing tether pulling Prior to tether pulling , cantilevers ( MLCT , Bruker AFM , Proes ) were plasma cleaned for 30 s ( Argon ) and incubated with 2 . 5 mg ml 2 1 concanavalin A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS for 1 . 5 h to establish a strong contact to the apical surface . Approach and retrace velocities were both set to 2 m m s 2 1 . Tether forces were converted into tension values T t using equation ( 3 . 5 ) . 5 . 7 . BSA coating of the substrate to avoid adhesion For the inhibition of adhesion of the suspended cells to the substrate by saturating unspecific binding sites , we functiona - lized Petri dishes with BSA . Therefore , we incubated the Petri dish with 5 % BSA in PBS for 20 min at 37 8 C . After mild rin - sing to remove excess BSA in solution , cell suspension was added to the substrate .
