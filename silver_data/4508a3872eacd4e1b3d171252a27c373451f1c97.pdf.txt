First , those could be macromolecules with useful pharmacological properties , such as proteins and peptides , i . e . protein and peptide drugs . Second , those could be various DNA - based constructs for gene therapy . Third , those could be synthetic or natural biocompatible soluble polymers carrying multiple moieties small drug molecules attached to a carrier protein via biodegradable or non - degradable bonds . In terms of size , this term can also include drug - loaded pharmaceutical nanocarriers , such as liposomes or polymeric micelles . The common feature of all listed preparations is their size in a nanometer region . Many of such drugs are developed for tumor therapy and , as one can expect , the key problem with their use is how to effectively deliver them to and into tumors or even inside individual tumor cells . It is now a well - established phenomenon that under certain circumstances ( in ﬂ ammation / hypoxia , ﬁ rst of all , which is typical for tumors , infarcts , and some other pathological sites in the body ) the endothelial lining of the blood vessel wall becomes more permeable than in the normal state . As a result , in such areas , large molecules and even relatively certain particles ranging from 10 to 500 nm in size , can leave the vascular bed and accumulate inside the interstitial space . This was clearly demonstrated in many tumors [ 1 , 2 ] and in infarcted areas [ 3 , 4 ] . Assuming these large ( polymeric ) molecules / particles are loaded with a pharmaceutical agent , they can bring this agent into the area with the increased vascular permeability , where the active drug can be eventually released from a carrier . Such spontaneous accumulation or “ passive ” targeting , which works especially good with tumors because of the lack of lymphatic drainage there , is currently known as enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR ) effect Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 63 ( 2011 ) 131 – 135 ☆ Thisreviewispartofthe AdvancedDrugDeliveryReviews themeissueon " EPReffect based drug design and clinical outlook for enhanced cancer chemotherapy " .

In other words , high permeability of the tumor vasculature allows macromolecules and nanoparticles to enter the tumor interstitial space , while the compromised lymphatic ﬁ ltration allows them to stay there . Unlike macromolecules , “ small ” low - molecular - weight pharmaceutical agents are not retained in tumors because of their ability to return to the circulation by diffusion [ 7 ] . EPR - mediated drug delivery is currently seen as an effective way to bring drugs to and into tumors , especially macromolecular drugs and drug - loaded pharmaceutical nanocarriers . The mechanisms and approaches underlying EPR - related phenomena are discussed in Greiesh et al . [ 8 ] . Interestingly , it was recently shown that EPR effect can be modulated by the blood pressure and substances that can in ﬂ uence it . Thus , elevated blood pressure was suggested as a strategy to increase tumor - targeted delivery of SMANCS [ 9 , 10 ] . 1 . Some general considerations Because the cut - off size of the permeabilized vasculature varies from case to case in rather broad limits — from 200 to 800 nm [ 1 , 11 ] , the size of a drug - carrying particle may be used to control the ef ﬁ cacy EPR - mediated drug delivery . Clearly , EPR - based type of tumor targeting requires macromolecular drugs and drug delivery systems to be long - circulating ( i . e . , to stay in the blood for extended periods of time ) in order to provide a suf ﬁ cient level of accumulation in the target . The most usual way to keep drug carriers in the blood long enough is to “ mask ” them by modifying ( grafting ) their surface with certain water - soluble polymers with a well - solvated and ﬂ exible main chain , such as polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) [ 12 , 13 ] . The surface - grafted “ protective ” polymers effectively prevent ( slow down ) the opsoniza - tion of drugs and drug carriers and their clearance by mononuclear phagocytic system ( MPS ) and also hinder the contact between PEGylated macromolecules and nanoparticles and phagocytic cells . The approach is best developed for liposomes [ 14 , 15 ] , although it has a rather broad applicability [ 16 ] . Important advantages of prolonged circulation of drugs and drug carriers in the blood ﬂ ow include the possibility of maintaining a required concentration of an active drug or drug carrier in the blood for a long time after a single administration ; the ability to utilize the EPR effect for the accumu - lation of pharmaceuticals in the areas with leaky vasculature ; and the possibility of enhancing ligand - mediated targeting of drugs and drug carriers into the areas with a limited blood supply and / or low concentration of a target antigen , where an extended time is required to allow for a suf ﬁ cient quantity of a drug in the target zone . 2 . Tumor delivery of proteins and peptides Many peptides and proteins possess biological activity that makes them potent and therapeutic , in particular , anticancer agents . Advances in solid - phase peptide synthesis and recombinant DNA and hybridoma technology allows for the production of unlimited quantities of clinical grade peptides and proteins . Their use as therapeutic agents is hampered , however , by their fast elimination from circulation mostly because of renal ﬁ ltration , fast enzymatic degradation , uptake by the mononuclear phagocyte ( MPS ) , and accumulation in non - targeted organs and tissues . Fast elimination and distribution into non - targeted organs and tissues causes the need to administer a drug in large quantities , which is often not economical and sometimes impossible due to non - speci ﬁ c toxicity . Conjugation of polypeptides with water - soluble polymers slows down the renal ﬁ ltration [ 17 ] thus increasing their longevity in circulation and allowing for their better accumulation in tumors via the EPR effect . Currently , polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) is the most popular polymer for the modi ﬁ cation of peptides and proteins with therapeutic potential [ 18 ] . Thus , PEGylated L - asparaginase has a circulation life - time of 5 . 7 days in humans compared to 1 . 2 days for the original enzyme [ 19 ] . Several polypeptide - PEG conjugates are already used as anticancer drugs . PEG – asparaginase used for the treatment of lymphoma and leukemia [ 19 , 20 ] and PEGylated interferon ( anon - speci ﬁ c stimulator of the immune system ) , the activity of which against various tumors is well documented [ 21 ] , can serve as good examples . PEGylated G - CSF , some other PEGylated hematopoietic growth factors ( GM - CSF , MGDF ) , PEGylated lymphokines , and PEGylated cytokine inhibitors are also subjects of preclinical and clinical trials as EPR - based anticancer agents , see Eliason [ 22 ] for review . 3 . Tumor delivery of macromolecules In some cases , the conjugation of drugs with polymers that are not large enough to prevent the renal clearance , but attach themselves and conjugated drug to natural long - circulating blood plasma components , like serum albumin or lipoproteins , can also be used to increase the circulation time . An example of such polymer is poly ( styrene - co - maleic acid anhydride ) ( SMA ) . It has been shown that the conjugation of peptides and proteins with a polymer of this type as short as 1 . 5 kDa increases circulation time of anticancer proteins and peptides via the binding of the conjugates to plasma albumin [ 7 ] . It has also been shown that , similar to conjugation with high - molecular - weight polymers , the conjugation with SMA protects proteins from enzymatic degradation , and decreases immunogenicity of modi ﬁ ed proteins [ 23 ] . Neocarzinostatin / SMA conjugate ( SMANCS ) used for the treatment of hepatoma [ 7 ] was clearly shown to accumulate in solid tumors via the EPR effect [ 5 , 23 ] and has served as a template for constructing other anticancer macromolecular drugs acting via the same mechanism [ 24 ] . Another family of macromolecular therapeutics delivered into tumors via the EPR effect is based on hydroxypropylmethacrylate ( HPMA ) , to which a broad variety of anticancer drugs was attached [ 25 , 26 ] . Moreover , HPMA - based macromolecular drugs accumulated in tumors via the EPR effect could be eventually delivered inside tumor cells and even speci ﬁ cally to cell nuclei by the attachment of certain additional functions to HPMA allowing for an enhanced intracellular uptake and organelle - speci ﬁ c targeting . Some additional data on macromolecular therapeutics for tumor treatment including those bypassing the multidrug resistance could be found in Refs . [ 27 – 33 ] . 4 . Tumor delivery of nanoparticles Long - circulating pharmaceutical nanocarriers , such as liposomes , micells , or polymeric nanoparticles , are capable of accumulating in various pathological areas with affected vasculature via the EPR effect , and have been repeatedly used for drug delivery into tumors via passive accumulation . Long - circulating liposomes and other nano - carriers demonstrate dose - independent , nonsaturable , log - linear kinetics , and increased bioavailability [ 34 ] . The anticancer drug doxorubicin incorporated into long - circulating PEG - coated liposomes , which is currently used in clinical conditions , demonstrates high ef ﬁ cacy in EPR - based tumor therapy and strongly diminishes the side - effects [ 35 , 36 ] characteristic of free doxorubicin . Doxorubicin in PEG - liposomes ( Doxil® and Caelyx® ) is successfully used for the treatment of solid tumors in patients with breast carcinoma metastases , with subsequent survival improvement [ 37 – 39 ] . The same set of indications was targeted by the combination therapy involving liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel [ 40 ] or Doxil / Caelyx and carboplatin [ 41 ] . Caelyx is currently also in Phase II studies for patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck [ 42 ] and ovarian cancer [ 43 ] . Clinical data showed the impressive effect of doxorubicin in PEG - liposomes against unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma [ 44 ] , cutaneous T - cell lymphoma [ 45 ] , and sarcoma [ 46 ] . The recent review on the successful use of Caelyx in the treatment of ovarian cancer can be found in Perez - Lopez et al . [ 47 ] . PEG was also attached to the liposome surface in a removable fashion to facilitate liposome capture by the cell after PEG - liposomes accumulate in target 132 V . Torchilin / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 63 ( 2011 ) 131 – 135 siteviatheEPReffect , andthePEGcoatingisdetachedundertheaction of local pathological conditions ( decreased pH in tumors ) . Detachable PEG conjugates are described in [ 48 ] , where the detachment process is based on the mild thiolysis of the dithiobenzylurethane linkage between PEG and an amino - containing substrate ( such as PE ) . Low pH - degradable PEG - lipid conjugates based on the hydrazone linkage between PEG and lipid have also been described [ 49 ; 50 ] . It should , however , be noted here that recent evidence showed that PEG - liposomes , previously considered biologically inert , could still induce certain side - reactions via activation of the complement system [ 51 , 52 ] . In the case of micellar preparations [ 53 ] of anticancer drugs , passive EPR - based micelle targeting to pathological organs or tissues can further increase the pharmaceutical ef ﬁ ciency of a micelle - encapsulated drug . Among drugs delivered by passively targeted micelles , one can name paclitaxel , which was shown to accumulate in tumors much better than its commercial formulation Taxol® , when loaded into micelles made of PEG - b - poly ( 4 - phenyl - 1 - butanoate ) - l - aspartamide conjugates [ 54 ] . With this preparation , an almost 100 - fold increase in the AUC , a 15 - fold decrease in the volume of distribution and a signi ﬁ cant decrease of drug clearance was achieved , which resulted in a 25 - fold improved drug accumulation in C - 26 tumors in mice and a corresponding increase in antitumor activity . Some other micellar preparations for passive targeting of paclitaxel have also been tested with variable degrees of success [ 54 , 55 ] . One of polymeric micelle - based preparation of paclitxel , Genexol - PM has already found its way to the clinic [ 55 ] . PEG - b - poly ( amino acid ) - based micelles loaded with cisplatin ( CDDP ) were designed for passive drug targeting into tumors and are undergoing clinical trials [ 56 ] . Among other micellar preparations for passive drug targeting in clinical trials , one can also mention doxorubicin in micelles made of PEG - block - poly ( l - aspartate ) – doxorubicin conjugate ( these micelles contain both free and hydrophobic block - conjugated drug ) [ 57 ] as well as doxorubicin in micelles made of Pluronic [ 58 ] . The problems with drug delivery using polymeric micelles for EPR - mediated passive targeting are usually associated with too fast drug release from the micelles and with the dif ﬁ culties of intracellular drug delivery [ 59 ] . In order to minimize drug release from the micelles , the drug can be chemically conjugated with the hydrophobic blocks of micelle - forming components or drug - loaded micelles can be additionally chemically cross - linked [ 60 – 63 ] . 5 . Tumor delivery of DNA and related products DNA and related products can also be delivered into tumors via the EPR effect as a part of long - circulating macromolecular or nanoparti - cular systems , in particular combining the passive EPR - mediated targeting with an additional ligand - mediating targeting facilitating the intracellular delivery [ 64 , 65 ] . Similar approaches are currently used for the tumor - speci ﬁ c delivery of siRNA [ 66 , 67 ] . In all cases , a suf ﬁ cient longevity of siRNA - loaded carriers is required to provide an initial EPR - mediated accumulation in tumors [ 68 , 69 ] . 5 . 1 . Then what ? Many current tumor drug delivery systems are trying to go further than just providing tumor accumulation . Attempts are under way to combine tumor cell - speci ﬁ c targeting with longevity - sponsored EPR accumulation . Thus , various antitumor antibodies are used to modify PEGylated drug - containing liposomes and further enhance their therapeutic effect via better delivery inside cells , for example , by receptor - mediated endocytosis [ 70 – 73 ] . Intracellular delivery of drug - loaded macromolecular conjugates and pharmaceutical nanocarriers accumulated in tumors via the EPR effect can be facilitated by various means . Thus , when the liposome is made of pH - sensitive components then , after being endocytosed , it fuses with the endovacuolar membrane under the action of lowered pH inside the endosome and destabilizes it , releasing its content into the cytoplasm , i . e . endosomes become the gates from the outside into the cell cytoplasm [ 74 ] . This approach has been reviewed many times in various publications ( in 2004 , endosomal escape by pH - sensitive drug delivery systems was speci ﬁ cally discussed in a special issue of Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews # 56 , J . C . Leroux , ed . ) . Passively targeted polymeric micelles can also demonstrate pH sensitivity and ability to escape from endosomes . Thus , micelles prepared from PEG - poly ( aspartate hydrazone adriamycin ) easily release an active drug at lowered pH values typical for endosomes and facilitate its cytoplasmic delivery and toxicity against cancer cells [ 75 ] . Alternatively , micelles for intracellular delivery of antisense ODN were prepared from ODN – PEG conjugates complexed with a cationic fusogenic peptide , KALA , and provided much higher intracellular delivery of the ODN than could be achieved with free ODN [ 76 ] . Endosomal escape could be also facilitated by using pH - sensitive fusogenic peptides attached to drug / gene - loaded nanocarriers [ 77 ] or endosomolytic polymers introduced as additional components to delivery systems [ 78 ] . Intracellular delivery of various systems could be enhanced by using cell - penetrating proteins and peptides [ 79 ] , sometimes built into complex systems with other functions in such a way that each function ( longevity , targeting , and cell penetration ) works only when required [ 49 , 50 , 80 ] . The recently suggested role of NO in facilitating the EPR effect and the possibility of using nitroglycerine in enhancing the EPR - mediated penetration of macromolecular drugs in tumors and infarcts [ 81 ] together with the generally favorable clinical effect of nitroglycerine in combination anticancer therapy [ 82 , 83 ] , open a new direction in exploring the EPR effect . So , the opportunities for the intratumoral drug delivery look just great . But whatever complex schemes are being developed to effectively bring anticancer drugs and genes into tumor cells , the EPR effect - mediated tumor accumulation remains the ﬁ rst crucial step of any scheme .
