Experimental studies have provided instances where a feedforward circuit ( FFC ) appears with modification of autoregulation , but little is known systematically about such autoregulation - integrated FFCs . Therefore , we aimed to examine whether the autoregulation - integrated FFC is a network motif relevant to describing the human transcriptional regulatory systems , and explored the relationship of such network motifs with biological functions . Results : Based on human - mouse evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites ( TFBSs ) in 76600 conserved blocks for 5169 genes , we compiled the human transcriptional connections into a matrix , and examined the number of FFC appearances in comparison with randomized networks . The results revealed that the configuration of autoregulation integrated in the FFC critically affects the abundance or avoidance of FFC appearances . In particular , an FFC comprising two repressors that are both autoregulated was revealed as a significant network motif , which we termed the double - autoregulation FFC ( DAR - FFC ) . Interestingly , this network motif preferentially constitutes effecter transcriptional circuits with functions in cell - cell signaling and multicellular organization , and is particularly related to nervous system development . Conclusions : We have revealed that the configuration of autoregulation integrated in the FFCs is a critical factor for abundance or avoidance of the appearance of the FFCs . In particular , we have identified the DAR - FFC as a distinctive integrated network motif endowed with properties that are indispensable for forming the transcriptional regulatory circuits involved in multicellular organization and nervous system development . This is the first report showing that the DAR - FFC is a significant network motif . Background It has been proposed that a complex system can be grasped using a small set of network motifs that recur significantly more often in the complex system than expected in its randomized network [ 1 - 5 ] . The tran - scriptional regulatory network of a cell is a complex sys - tem in which many transcription factor ( TF ) proteins turn gene expressions on and off according to spatio - temporal contexts . A feedforward circuit ( FFC ) compris - ing two regulators has systematically been shown to be a network motif in the transcriptional regulatory networks of Escherichia coli [ 1 - 5 ] , yeast [ 2 - 6 ] and higher eukaryotes [ 4 , 7 , 8 ] . It is crucial to find an appropriate set of such basic network motifs to intelligibly describe the gene regulatory system . One of the simplest network motifs is autoregulation , in which a regulator ( TF ) regulates the gene that encodes the regulator itself . An FFC is known to appear in some instances with modification of autoregulation [ 3 , 9 , 10 ] , but no systematic studies on autoregulation - integrated FFCs have yet been carried out . Therefore , we aimed to elucidate whether the autoregulation - inte - grated FFC forms a distinct network motif relevant to describing the transcriptional network , and explored the relationships of this network motif with biological func - tions . For this purpose , we examined the influence of * Correspondence : iwama @ med . kagawa - u . ac . jp 1 Life Science Research Center , Kagawa University , 1750 - 1 Ikenobe , Miki - cho , Kita - gun , Kagawa 761 - 0793 , Japan Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Iwama et al .

We compiled the human transcriptional connections into a connection matrix , based on the computationally identified human - mouse conserved TF binding sites ( TFBSs ) of 82 well - annotated TFs in 76600 conserved blocks located within the 8 - kb upstream sequences of 5169 human genes that were stringent orthologs to mouse counterpart genes . Subsequently , we randomized the connection matrix in a degree - preserving manner [ 1 - 4 , 11 , 12 ] , and obtained 1000 randomized matrices or networks . We then estimated the degree of overrepre - sentation or underrepresentation of the number of appearances for each circuit . The FFC we examined consisted of two regulators . The first regulator has effects on the second regulator such that the two regula - tors jointly regulate a target gene . The first regulator is termed the ‘ originating regulator ’ and the second regula - tor is termed the ‘ intermediary regulator ’ . We also examined the number of appearances of the ‘ regulator chain backbone ’ , which represents a simple two - regula - tor one - way connection irrespective of the presence of a target gene common to the two regulators . To date , analyses of unicellular organisms have shown that ( I ) the FFC is a network motif [ 1 - 5 ] , ( II ) the appearance of coherent FFCs outnumbers the appearance of incoher - ent FFCs [ 1 , 5 , and please see the circuit graphs of ‘ coherent ’ and ‘ incoherent ’ FFCs in the left margin of Figure 1a ] and ( III ) the coherent type - 1 FFC composed of two activator regulators is the most abundant FFC [ 5 ] . Our dataset of human transcriptional connections also showed significantly overrepresented appearances of such FFCs , consistent with findings I , II and III in uni - cellular organisms . In the present study , we further expanded the scope of network motifs to a category of small - scale integrated circuits by analyzing the autoregulation - integrated FFCs . In contrast to the conservativeness of the usage of sim - ple FFC network motifs , our results revealed that the configuration of autoregulation integrated in the FFCs is a critical factor for abundance or avoidance of the appearance of the FFCs . In particular , we found that an FFC composed of two repressor regulators with autore - gulation on each of them is a significant network motif . We report here that this novel network motif is prefer - entially involved in intercellular communication and multicellularity - oriented functions and particularly related to nervous system development . Results Overrepresentation of coherent type - 1 FFCs We first classified the FFCs into four classes based on the combinations of the modes ( activator or repressor ) of the originating and intermediary regulators [ 1 , 5 ] ( Fig - ure 1a ) . Following the FFC classification of Mangan and Alon [ 5 ] , coherent and incoherent FFCs were further categorized as type 1 when the originating regulator was an activator and type 2 when it was a repressor . In addi - tion , we separately evaluated the FFCs targeting TF genes and effecter ( non - TF ) genes because if an FFC targets a TF gene , the TF gene can again act as a node that further integrates other circuits but if an FFC tar - gets an effecter gene , it is the terminal output of the FFC . As a result , the total appearance of FFCs and the appearance of coherent FFCs were both significantly overrepresented in the real network , and the coherent FFCs outnumbered the incoherent FFCs ( Table 1 ) . In particular , the coherent type - 1 FFC targeting an effecter gene was markedly overrepresented ( P < 0 . 005 , see the Methods ) ( Figure 1a ) . These overrepresentations were consistent with previous findings in E . coli [ 1 , 5 ] and yeast [ 5 ] . However , the degrees of representation of categories other than the coherent type 1 category did not show remarkable deviations from the random expectations . The configuration of autoregulation critically affects the FFC abundance To examine the influence of autoregulation , we classi - fied the FFCs according to the presence or absence of autoregulation on each regulator of an FFC without respect to the regulators ’ modes . This classification cre - ated four classes , which we termed ( I ) double - autoregu - lation , ( II ) intermediary - only autoregulated , ( III ) originating - only autoregulated and ( IV ) no autoregula - tion ( Figure 1b ) . We found that categories III and IV , both of which have no autoregulation on the intermedi - ary regulator , were consistently underrepresented , while in sharp contrast , categories I and II , both of which have autoregulation on the intermediary regulator , were overrepresented ( Figure 1b ) . Therefore , the absence of intermediary autoregula - tion was a hallmark for avoidance of FFC formation . In particular , the FFC composed of an autoregulated ori - ginating regulator and an autoregulation - less inter - mediary regulator was a significant antimotif common to TF and effecter target genes . Regarding the regula - tor chain backbone , autoregulation on the intermediary regulator was shown to be a significant factor for a higher frequency of appearance than expected in the random networks . These results demonstrated that the FFC , which was overrepresented as a whole , could be broken down into distinct classes that were hetero - geneous in abundance or avoidance of the appearance of the FFC depending on the configuration of autoregulation .

This combined classification revealed two significant antimotifs of FFCs common to the TF and effecter target genes ( Figure 1c ) . Both of these antimotifs were composed of an originat - ing repressor regulator with autoregulation and an inter - mediary regulator without autoregulation irrespective of the mode . Since the degrees of representation of the backbone regulator chain for these motifs did not devi - ate much from the random expectations , the configura - tion of the autoregulated repressor with autoregulation - less intermediation is likely to have a specific disadvan - tage for feedforward synergistic control of the effecter . A novel network motif , the double - autorepression FFC ( DAR - FFC ) The autoregulation - and - mode combined classification further revealed a significantly overrepresented network motif to which little attention has been paid . Specifically , this motif is the DAR - FFC that targets effecter genes in which both regulators are repressors with autoregulation ( Figure 1d ) . Compared with the degree of representation of the backbone regulatory chain for this double - autore - pression configuration , the DAR - FFC targeting an effec - ter showed a remarkable increase in its representation . This result indicates that the DAR - FFC has specific fea - tures that are advantageous for controlling effecter genes . Preferred functions of DAR - FFC - targeted effecter genes To explore the functionalities in which DAR - FFCs play key roles , we assessed the types of biological activities pre - ferred by DAR - FFCs . We conducted Gene Ontology ( GO ) [ 13 ] enrichment analyses on the effecter genes targeted by DAR - FFCs . Interestingly , we found that the most enriched molecular function of the DAR - FFC - targeted effecters was ‘ growth factor activity ’ ( Table 2 ) . The highly enriched functions of the DAR - FFC - targeted effecters were gener - ally categorized into two functionalities , i . e . cell - cell signaling and auxiliary transcriptional regulation . The cell - cell signaling activities that were preferentially targeted by DAR - FFCs encompassed ‘ growth factor activity ’ and ‘ cyto - kine activity ’ as humoral cell - cell communication , ‘ voltage - gated ion channel activity ’ as a key role for neuronal trans - mission and ‘ extracellular matrix ( ECM ) structural consti - tuent ’ together with ‘ integrin binding ’ as the right pair of ECM - mediated intercellular communications ( Table 2 ) . All of these functions represent major cell - cell communi - cation activities in higher eukaryotes . On the other hand , the enrichment of auxiliary transcriptional regulator activ - ity , such as ‘ transcriptional regulator activity ’ and ‘ tran - scription factor binding ’ , also indicates an enhancement of the information integration capability at the transcrip - tional level , which corresponds to the increased demand for information processing potentially brought about by multicellularization . This multicellularity - oriented involvement of DAR - FFCs was clearly demonstrated by GO enrichment ana - lyses of biological processes in the DAR - FFC - targeted effecters , in which ‘ multicellular organismal develop - ment ’ topped the list with marked statistical significance ( P ≈ 5 × 10 - 32 , see the Methods ) ( Table 3 ) . The list sub - sequently included ‘ nervous system development ’ , ‘ Wnt Table 1 Statistical data for feedforward circuits and autoregulation in the real human transcriptional network in comparison with 1000 randomized networks Appearance in the real network Appearance in the randomized networks ( mean ± s . d . * ) Z score P * Feedforwardcircuit ( FFC ) Coherent 403774 378991 ± 13650 1 . 816 P ≈ 0 . 035 Incoherent 103468 105296 ± 7675 - 0 . 238 P ≈ 0 . 406 Total 507242 484287 ± 13837 1 . 659 P < 0 . 05 Autoregulation 41 36 . 42 ± 2 . 95 1 . 551 P ≈ 0 . 060 The mean , s . d . and P value of each circuit were computed based on the number of appearances in the 1000 randomized connection matrices ( see the Methods ) .

Furthermore , ‘ transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway ’ , which contributes diverse intercellular communications , was also revealed as a biological process preferred by the DAR - FFC - targeted effecters . DAR - FFC interlinks forming higher - order DAR - FFCs The TFs that constitute DAR - FFCs in the real human transcriptional networks were found to be densely inter - connected ( Figure 2 ) . All of these DAR - FFCs were shown to target effecter genes that preferentially contri - bute to ‘ multicellular organismal development ’ ( Figure 2 andAdditional file 1 ) . Notably , in 10 of the 13 DAR - FFCs , the biological process ‘ multicellular organismal development ’ topped the lists , followed by biological processes related to nervous system development ( Figure 2 andAdditional file 1 ) . These results suggest that the preferential involvement of DAR - FFCs in nervous sys - tem development is a general feature of DAR - FFCs . One of the merits of considering the DAR - FFC as a unit is that it allows us to recognize a higher - order net - work structure . The TF - TF connections that constitute individual DAR - FFCs targeting effecter genes in turn form a higher - order DAR - FFC when a DAR - FFC ’ s target gene is a TF that participates in the other DAR - FFC ( Figure 3 ) . For example , as shown in Figure 3 , a higher - order DAR - FFC consists of two DAR - FFC TF - TF con - nections , i . e . one is MSX1 - | PRDM1 and the other is ZBTB7A - | PRDM1 . In this higher - order DAR - FFC , MSX1 is deemed to be an intermediary regulator and its feedforward path corresponds to the connection from ZBTB7A to PRDM1 . Consequently , PRDM1 ( a TF ) is deemed to be a target gene . In the higher - order DAR - FFC , the important difference from the individual DAR - FFCs is the target . The target of a higher - order DAR - FFC is a TF , whereas the target of an individual DAR - FFC is a set of effecter genes . In the same way , Figure 3 demonstrates that MSX1 functions as an inter - mediary regulator of the feedforward path of GFI1B - | PRDM1 . As a result , we identified five higher - order DAR - FFCs in 13 TF - TF connections of the DAR - FFCs . This densely connected feature of the higher - order DAR - FFCs coin - cided with the results of motif representation analyses in the autoregulation - and - mode combined classification in which the DAR - FFC targeting a TF was the most overrepresented ( P ≈ 0 . 060 , see the Methods ) among the FFCs that target TFs . The aspect of these higher - order DAR - FFCs provides another interesting network feature . Among the five higher - order DAR - FFCs ( Figure 3 ) , KLF12 is the only node that always acts as an originating regulator in all three higher - order DAR - FFCs in which it is involved . This TF ( KLF12 ) shows a clear contrast to ZBTB7A and GFI1B that have different roles , i . e . an originating regu - lator and two intermediary regulators , and an originat - ing regulator and a target , respectively . These findings suggest the possibility that KLF12 has the distinctive function of being a ‘ higher - order originating regulator hub ’ that potentially spreads regulatory effects through DAR - FFC - mediated transmissions . The delineation of the DAR - FFC as a network motif provides further potential to reveal such complexity of the higher - order features of regulatory networks . The confidence of the results is robust against TF mode perturbation Since the mode ( positive or negative ) is not guaranteed for all of the predicted connections regulated by the positive and negative TFs , it is important to examine the robustness of the confidence of the results under the assumption that positive TFs partially act as negative TFs and vice versa . For this purpose , we performed mode perturbation analyses by swapping the modes of the connections regulated by positive and negative TFs with proportions of 1 % , 5 % , 10 % , 15 % and 20 % . As a result , we confirmed that the Z scores that were statisti - cally significant in the results remained at statistically significant levels after the positive - negative mode pertur - bations of 1 % through 20 % ( Figures 4 and 5 ) . The changes in the Z scores were seemingly paradoxical for the antimotifs ( Figure 5 ) , i . e . the effecter - targeting FFCs composed of an originating repressor regulator with autoregulation and an intermediary regulator without autoregulation irrespective of the mode , because these confidence levels increased despite the perturbation pro - cedures .

Therefore , the mode perturbation procedures move the confidence levels for these FFCs closer to the confidence level of the category of the originating - only autoregulated FFCs targeting effecters , the Z score of which is - 1 . 911 ( Figure 1b ) . The plots in Figure 5 show that the Z scores for these anti - motif FFCs move closer to the value of - 1 . 911 with an increase in the proportion of the mode - perturbed con - nections . These observations demonstrate that the confi - dence of the main results is robust against perturbation of the mode assignments of the positive and negative TFs . Discussion We have demonstrated that the DAR - FFC in which the two repressor regulators are both autoregulated is a dis - tinct and significant network motif in the human tran - scriptional regulatory network . We were able to improve the resolution power for analyzing the network circuitry by devising an autoregulation - based FFC classification and combining it with the mode - based FFC classifica - tion . By focusing on the autoregulation - integrated FFC , we demonstrated the analytical relevance of such small - scale integrated circuits that are positioned between ele - mentary circuit units ( e . g . autoregulation and simple FFCs ) and large - scale integrated circuits ( e . g . ‘ dense overlapping regulon ’ ) [ 1 ] . This autoregulation - based classification has an important logical feature in that it merely depends on the circuit structure without intro - ducing any qualitative features ( i . e . repressor or activa - tor ) of the regulator , and it still enabled the delineation of specific antimotifs . We also showed that the overall FFC , coherent FFC and coherent type - 1 FFC appearances were each signifi - cantly overrepresented in the human transcriptional reg - ulatory network based on the conventional mode - based classification . These results are consistent with previous findings in E . coli and yeast , suggesting strong evolution - ary conservation of the usage of FFCs , particularly type - 1 coherent FFCs , at the system level . The autoregulation - and - mode combined classification enabled us to identify two antimotifs that were both composed of an originating repressor regulator with autoregulation and an intermediary regulator without autoregulation irrespective of the mode . This autoregu - lation configuration is likely to have a specific disadvan - tage for feedforward synergistic control of the effecter . From the viewpoint of circuit dynamics , negative autore - gulation formed by a repressor has been reported to speed up the response of its own regulator [ 14 ] . There - fore , the aforementioned antimotifs that each form a cir - cuit of a quick originating regulator aided by a slower modifier ( i . e . intermediary regulator ) seem to be inap - propriate for fine - tuning of the target gene , possibly because the modifier is required to monitor the originat - ing regulator at a higher frequency than the switching frequency of the originating regulator . The combined classification further revealed the DAR - FFC that targets effecter genes as a novel network motif (cid:2) (cid:50)(cid:52)(cid:38)(cid:47)(cid:19)(cid:2) (cid:47)(cid:53)(cid:58)(cid:19)(cid:2) (cid:41)(cid:40)(cid:43)(cid:19)(cid:36)(cid:2) (cid:45)(cid:46)(cid:40)(cid:19)(cid:20) (cid:37)(cid:39)(cid:36)(cid:50)(cid:41)(cid:2) (cid:39)(cid:20)(cid:40)(cid:19)(cid:2) (cid:42)(cid:39)(cid:53)(cid:19)(cid:2) (cid:60)(cid:36)(cid:54)(cid:36)(cid:25)(cid:35)(cid:2) X Y Z X Y Z X Y XY Z XY Z Z Figure 3 Higher - order network structures of DAR - FFCs .

The role assigned to a TF by each individual higher - order DAR - FFC is indicated with a symbol ( X = originating regulator ; Y = intermediary regulator ; or Z = target ) along the corresponding axis near the angle of the triangle . This schema illustrates that KLF12 always acts as an X ( originating regulator ) in all three higher - order DAR - FFCs in which it is involved , indicating that it may function as a ‘ higher - order originating regulator hub ’ .

The changes in the Z scores are shown in plots with closed triangles along the proportions with which the TF modes of the connections were randomly swapped between positive and negative . This perturbation procedure was repeated ten times with each proportion of 1 % , 5 % , 10 % , 15 % and 20 % for ( a ) antimotif N - N targeting effecters , i . e . effecter - targeting FFCs composed of an originating repressor regulator with autoregulation and an intermediary repressor regulator without autoregulation , and ( b ) antimotif N - P targeting effectors , i . e . effecter - targeting FFCs composed of an originating repressor regulator with autoregulation and an intermediary activator regulator without autoregulation . The plots show that the confidence levels represented by the Z scores increase despite the mode perturbation procedure . This seemingly paradoxical phenomenon is attributable to the fact that , even if the mode is perturbed , both the antimotif N - N and antimotif N - P targeting effectors come to fall into the category of the originating - only autoregulated FFCs targeting effecters . Therefore , the mode perturbation procedures move the confidence levels for these FFCs closer to the confidence level of the category of the originating - only autoregulated FFCs targeting effecters , the Z score of which is - 1 . 911 ( see Figure 1b ) . The closed circle on each y - axis represents the Z score of the main results ( i . e . without perturbation ) . Iwama et al .

The overrepresentation of the number of DAR - FFC appear - ances is possibly explained by the facts that the autore - pression integrated in the DAR - FFC provides robustness against stochastic perturbation [ 15 ] and accelerates reaching a stable transcription level [ 14 ] , which conse - quently make DAR - FFCs advantageous for controlling the effecters . This notion is specifically supported by the finding that the most preferred molecular function of the DAR - FFC - targeted effecters was ‘ growth factor activity ’ ( Table 2 ) , since cellular responses to a growth factor have been reported to require a set of key ‘ repres - sive ’ transcriptional regulators to achieve tightly con - trolled signal attenuation processes [ 16 ] . Consequently , the swiftness and robustness of DAR - FFCs are suitable properties for the signaling systems of various growth factors . In addition to ‘ growth factor activity ’ , the effecter functions targeted by the DAR - FFCs demonstrated a marked preference for intercellular communications through humoral , neuronal and ECM - mediated signaling modalities , representing the major intercellular commu - nications in higher eukaryotes . Another functionality significantly preferred by the DAR - FFC - targeted effec - ters included transcription - modifying activities that increase the information integration capacities at the transcriptional level . These properties of DAR - FFCs have a crucial advantage for enhancing the information transmission and integration that is inevitable for the inflated needs of information processing that are possi - bly brought about multicellularization . Notably , and consistent with the above notion , we found that ‘ multicellular organismal development ’ was by far the most preferred biological process among DAR - FFC - targeted effecters . It is also noteworthy that ‘ multicellular organismal development ’ was followed in the list by biological processes related to the neuronal cell fate program , namely ‘ nervous system development ’ , ‘ Wnt receptor signaling pathway ’ and ‘ axon guidance ’ . This preference for nervous system development is a general feature of DAR - FFCs because all the individual DAR - FFC connections identified in the present study had effecter genes with preferred functions within ‘ mul - ticellular organismal development ’ and ‘ nervous system development ’ . Furthermore , our network analyses revealed that the DAR - FFCs were densely intercon - nected , and that individual DAR - FFCs formed a higher - order DAR - FFC topology . This topology included a pos - sible ‘ higher - order originating regulator hub ’ that poten - tially spreads regulatory effects through DAR - FFC - mediated transmissions . These dense interlinking fea - tures of DAR - FFCs are likely to provide further robust - ness for transcriptional regulatory networks involved in multicellularity and nervous system development . Based on the results of the network motif representa - tion analyses , GO functional analyses and higher - order network structures , we suggest that the DAR - FFC iden - tified in the present study is a distinctive integrated net - work motif endowed with properties that are indispensable for forming the transcriptional regulatory circuits essential for multicellular organization and ner - vous system development . An intelligible and compre - hensive description of the transcriptional regulatory system requires an appropriate set of network motifs that would include integrated network motifs such as the DAR - FFC . It is necessary to elucidate other potential integrated network motifs with a sufficient descriptive power for understanding the gene regulatory system . The degree of integration or abstraction of these motifs would vary depending on the purpose of the description of the system . Conclusions We have demonstrated that the configuration of autore - gulation integrated in the FFC critically affects the FFC abundance or avoidance . In particular , we found that the DAR - FFC composed of two repressors with autore - gulation is a novel significantly overrepresented network motif . Notably , we have revealed that DAR - FFCs consti - tute transcriptional circuits that preferentially control multicellular organization and nervous system develop - ment . These results suggest that the DAR - FFC is a key component that is essential for the multicellularization of higher eukaryotes . Methods Human - mouse orthologous upstream sequences We downloaded genome sequences and annotations for humans ( Build 37 . 1 ) and mice ( Build 36 . 3 ) from NCBI at ftp . ncbi . nih . gov / genomes / . We parsed the annotations and selected protein - coding genes that did not overlap with other genes . We further chose genes whose upstream sequences did not overlap with other genes for at least 8 kb upstream of the translation start site . If a gene had alternative transcription / translation start or end sites , we always adopted the 5 ’ - most site for the start site and the 3 ’ - most for the end site . These retrieval processes yielded 14021 genes for humans and 16412 genes for mice . To stringently identify human - mouse orthologs , we selected genes whose official gene symbols were identical between humans and mice . This ortholog assignment approach is effective for human - mouse comparisons [ 17 , 18 ] , because the same official gene symbol is endowed based on well - curated functional experimental evi - dence . Finally , we obtained 5169 orthologous 8 - kb upstream sequence pairs ( Additional file 2 and our website [ 19 ] ) . Iwama et al . BMC Genomics 2011 , 12 : 228 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2164 / 12 / 228 Page 9 of 12 TF gene selection Among the 5169 orthologs , we identified TF genes according to the GO ‘ molecular functions ’ category by surveying the gene2go file of NCBI reference sequences ( RefSeq ) [ 20 ] at ftp . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / gene / DATA / . We regarded genes assigned to ‘ transcription factor activity ’ ( GO : 0003700 ) as TF genes , which amounted to 307 TF genes . We further selected the TF genes with known binding motifs by searching TRANSFAC [ 21 ] Profes - sional 12 . 2 for the binding motif matrices under the con - ditions that ( I ) an official gene symbol of the TF was unequivocally designated , ( II ) the TF gene was included in the 5169 orthologs , ( III ) the TF was able to function even if it did not form a complex with other TFs , ( IV ) the motif matrix was not a composite one with other kinds of TFs , and ( V ) the motif matrix existed in humans or mice . A total of 82 TFs were assigned to corresponding motif matrices that fulfilled the above five conditions . To iden - tify the mode of each of the 82 TFs , i . e . positive ( activa - tor ) , negative ( repressor ) or bimodal regulator , we surveyed the descriptions of GO , Entrez Gene [ 22 ] and TRANSFAC ( Additional file 3 ) . In the analyses in which the TF mode affected the results , we excluded the counts of every circuit that included a bimodal TF or a mode - unspecified TF , since the particular connections and the proportion of connections that were positive or negative for these TFs were mostly uncertain with regard to our predicted regulatory connections . On the contrary , in cases where the TF mode did not affect the results , the counts of the circuits that included a bimodal or a mode - unspecified TF were not excluded from the statis - tics . These cases were the analyses of the overall FFCs , the overall autoregulations , and the autoregulation - configura - tion classification regardless of the mode ( Figure 1b ) . TFBS prediction We searched the 8 - kb upstream sequence of each of the 82 TFs for TFBS motifs using the MATCH ™ program [ 23 ] with a score cutoff of 0 . 9 and a motif - core score cut - off of 0 . 8 . To identify conserved TFBS motifs , we per - formed a genomic alignment for each of the 5169 8 - kb orthologous upstream sequence pairs using ReAlignerV [ 18 ] with its default settings . We obtained 76600 con - served blocks whose identities were ≥ 70 % . Next , we retrieved TFBSs that met the following three conditions between the human and mouse motifs : ( I ) the motif directions were the same ; ( II ) both motifs were located within a conserved block ; and ( III ) the identity of the pair of motifs was ≥ 90 % . Finally , we obtained 386237 con - served TFBSs ( Additional file 4 and our website [ 19 ] ) . Connection matrix randomization Transcriptional targeting of the 82 TFs to the 5169 genes was represented as a connection matrix , M , in which Mij = 1 if TF j targets gene i and Mij = 0 in the absence of such targeting ( Additional file 5 ) . Since all of the 82 TF genes were included in the 5169 genes , it was possible to examine autoregulation for the 82 TFs . Start - ing from the original connection matrix of the real data , we created randomized matrices , so that every TF j should target the same number of genes as in the origi - nal matrix and every gene i should be targeted by the same number of TFs as in the original matrix [ 1 - 4 ] . According to a previously described method [ 12 ] , we performed the randomization using stepwise processes as follows . We randomly chose a pair of columns ( TFs ) , a and b ( a ≠ b ) , and a pair of rows ( genes ) , m and n ( m ≠ n ) . When M ma = 1 and M nb = 1 , we further checked whether M na = 0 and M mb = 0 . If the four equations were satisfied , we swapped the elements such that M ma = 0 , M nb = 0 , M na = 1 and M mb = 1 . We obtained 1000 randomized connection matrices by repeating these swapping steps 500000 times for each randomization . To determine the number of swapping steps that resulted in sufficient randomization of the original con - nection matrix , we monitored the number of value - changed elements from the original connection matrix by varying the number of swapping steps ( 100 , 1000 , 10000 , 50000 , 100000 , 500000 , 1000000 and 5000000 steps ) , and for each number of swapping steps , we repeated the randomization 100 times . As a result , the number of value - changed elements reached a plateau phase with 500000 swapping steps , and the use of 1000000 and 5000000 swapping steps yielded no signifi - cant increases in the numbers of value - changed ele - ments . Therefore , we determined that 500000 swapping steps were sufficient for randomization of the original connection matrix . GO enrichment analyses First , we examined the background set of GO ‘ molecular functions ’ terms for the 4862 effecter genes ( i . e . 5169 total genes - 307 TF genes ) . The total number of redun - dant appearances of the GO terms assigned to all the effecters was denoted as E ( E = 12319 ) , and the number of non - redundant appearances of the GO terms was denoted as N ( N = 1562 ) . For each non - redundant GO term g of the N terms , the number of appearances within all the effecters was denoted as F g . Next , we focused on the DAR - FFC - targeted effecters . The total number of redundant appearances of the GO terms of all the DAR - FFC - targeted effecters was denoted as D ( D = 31105 ) . The number of appearances of each g for all the DAR - FFC - targeted effecters was denoted as f g . It should be noted that there were cases in which an effecter was targeted by multiple DAR - FFCs . The probability of g appearing in the back - ground set was denoted as r g , which was computed as Iwama et al . BMC Genomics 2011 , 12 : 228 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2164 / 12 / 228 Page 10 of 12 r g = F g / E . For each g , we assumed that f g followed a binomial distribution with a probability r g and number of trials D . Therefore , for each g , we computed the probability P g of the g appearing more than f g times in all the DAR - FFCs as follows . P g = 1 − f g (cid:2) k = 1 (cid:3) D k (cid:4) r gk (cid:5) 1 − r g (cid:6) ( D − k ) ( 1 ) We ranked the P g values in increasing order to show the highly enriched GO terms . The GO terms that appeared at frequencies of ≤ 0 . 1 % of E were discarded from the list . We separately conducted the same proce - dures described above for the GO ‘ biological processes ’ terms . We performed GO ‘ biological processes ’ enrichment analyses for each of the 13 DAR - FFC TF - TF connec - tions separately . The total number of redundant appear - ances of the GO terms assigned to effecters targeted by the i - th DAR - FFC TF - TF connection was denoted as D i . The number of appearances of each g for the effecters targeted by the i - th DAR - FFC TF - TF connection was denoted as f ( g , i ) . We used the same value r g as above . For each g and each i , we computed the probability P ( g , i ) as follows . P ( g , i ) = 1 − f ( g , i ) (cid:2) k = 1 (cid:3) D i k (cid:4) r gk (cid:5) 1 − r g (cid:6) ( D − k ) ( 2 ) The GO terms with frequencies of ≤ 0 . 05 % of E or P ( g , i ) values of ≥ 0 . 01 were discarded from the list for these analyses . Statistical analyses For each circuit , the mean and standard deviation were computed based on the appearance in each of the 1000 randomized matrices , and the P value and Z score were estimated by assuming a standard normal distribution . TF mode perturbation analyses To assess the robustness against perturbation of the mode assignments of the TFs , we randomly selected the connections regulated by positive TFs and negative TFs with proportions of 1 % , 5 % , 10 % , 15 % and 20 % , and stored the selected connections for each proportion . This procedure was repeated 10 times for each of the five proportions . To the selected connections stored for the resulting 50 sets , we applied swapped modes between positive and negative , and subsequently com - puted the Z scores based on the 1000 randomized and one real connection matrices that were used in the main analyses .
