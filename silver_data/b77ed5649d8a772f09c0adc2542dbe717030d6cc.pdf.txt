This study investigates how coﬁlin and Arp2 / 3 complex , two main players in the dendritic nucle - ation model , interact to produce sharp spatial transitions between densely branched ﬁlaments and long , unbranched ﬁlaments . Results : We found that coﬁlin binding reduces both the afﬁnity of actin ﬁlaments for Arp2 / 3 complex and the stability of branches . We used ﬂuorescence spectroscopy to mea - sure the kinetics of coﬁlin association with ﬁlaments and the resulting dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complex and TIRF microscopy to visualize ﬁlament severing and the loss of actin ﬁlament branches . Coﬁlin severs ﬁlaments optimally when few actin subunits are occupied but dissociates branches rapidly only at higher occupancies . Effective debranching is nevertheless achieved , as a result of coopera - tive binding and reduced afﬁnity of Arp2 / 3 complex for the ﬁla - ment , at coﬁlin concentrations below those required for direct competition . Conclusions : Coﬁlin rapidly dissociates Arp2 / 3 complex and branches by direct competition for binding sites on the actin ﬁlament and by propagation of structural changes in the actin ﬁlament that reduce afﬁnity for Arp2 / 3 complex . Introduction Cellular motility requires precise spatial and temporal control over the assembly and disassembly of actin ﬁlaments on a time scale of seconds . Actin can self - assemble , but the poly - mers are quite stable compared with actin ﬁlaments in cells . Multiple lines of evidence have implicated ADF / coﬁlin proteins in promoting the assembly and turnover of actin ﬁlaments in yeast actin patches [ 1 ] and actin ﬁlament comet tails of Listeria [ 2 , 3 ] . Paradoxically , coﬁlins nucleate ﬁlaments at high concentrations [ 4 – 7 ] and accelerate release of the g - phos - phate from ADP - P i - actin ﬁlaments at intermediate concentra - tions [ 8 ] , but sever ADP - actin ﬁlaments at low concentrations [ 6 , 9 – 11 ] . Coﬁlin also promotes dissociation of actin ﬁlament branches mediated by Arp2 / 3 complex [ 12 ] . This activity was attributed to the ability of coﬁlin to dissociate phosphate from ADP - P i - actin ﬁlaments . Here we show that simple binding of coﬁlins to actin ﬁlaments rapidly dissociates actin ﬁlament branches . This debranching reaction is so fast that it can account for the turnover of actin ﬁlament branches on a time scale of a few seconds at the leading edge of motile cells . We provide a mechanistic explanation for how coﬁlin uses differential occupancy of ﬁlaments to exert its various activities . These insights strengthen the case for coﬁlin exerting differential effects on the actin system in accordance with its local concentration in the cell [ 6 ] . Results Binding of S . pombe Coﬁlin to ADP and ADP - P i Actin Filaments To characterize the kinetics of ﬁssion yeast coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments under the conditions that we used to study the effects of coﬁlin on Arp2 / 3 complex , we measured the time course of quenching of the ﬂuorescence of pyrenyl - actin [ 3 , 9 ] at ﬁve concentrations of ADP - actin ( 0 . 5 – 5 m M ) and three concentrations of ADP - P i - actin as a function of coﬁlin concen - tration ( 1 – 5 m M ) . Fluorescence decreased rapidly in millisec - onds to seconds as coﬁlin bound to ﬁlaments composed of ADP or ADP - P i subunits ( Figures 1A – 1D ) . We interpret this ﬂuorescence change as the binding of coﬁlin to polymerized actin . Under these conditions , binding was much faster than when coﬁlin concentrations were limiting [ 6 , 8 ] . At given concentrations of actin and coﬁlin , the ﬂuorescence change was about ten times faster with ADP - actin ﬁlaments than ADP - P i - actin ﬁlaments in the presence of 25 mM phos - phate . The time courses were identical in 20 % and 100 % pyr - enyl - actin , all following double exponentials ( Figure 1 ) with a rapid , large - amplitude component and a slow , small - ampli - tude component . The small component was more prominent at substoichiometric ratios of coﬁlin to actin and decreased to less than 6 % of the total change at high coﬁlin concentra - tions . The observed rate constants of the small amplitude component were , however , independent of the concentrations of actin and coﬁlin and always two or more magnitudes smaller than the rate constant of the fast component . The observed rate constants of the large - amplitude , fast exponential components increased linearly with coﬁlin concentrations . These experiments were conducted with similar concentrations of coﬁlin and actin , so both reactants were depleted during the reactions . Because the reactions followed exponential time courses , the rate - enhancing effects of cooperativity [ 13 – 16 ] must have offset the slowing of the reactions resulting from depletion of both reactants . Coﬁlin Dissociates Arp2 / 3 Complex as It Binds to Actin Filaments We used S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex labeled with pyrene on Cys167 of the ARPC2 subunit ( pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex ) to measure association of the complex with actin ﬁlaments , because its ﬂuorescence is 6 - fold higher when bound to actin ﬁlaments [ 17 ] . This assay showed that Arp2 / 3 complex binds to ( k + = 1 . 5 3 10 2 4 m M 2 1 s 2 1 ) and dissociates from ( k - = 1 . 0 3 10 2 3 s 2 1 ) actin ﬁlaments very slowly [ 17 ] . * Correspondence : thomas . pollard @ yale . edu Addition of coﬁlin to ADP - actin ﬁlaments decorated with pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex resulted in the rapid decrease in ﬂuorescence ( Figure 2A ) . The most likely explanation for the decline in ﬂuorescence is dissociation of pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex from actin ﬁlaments , but the discussion considers an alternative mechanism . The rate of this ﬂuorescence change was orders of magnitude faster than the spontaneous dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complex from ADP - actin ﬁlaments ( control plot in Figure 2A and [ 17 ] ) . A given coﬁlin concentra - tion caused the ﬂuorescence of pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex and the ﬂuorescence of pyrenyl - ADP - actin ﬁlaments to decline with similar time courses ( Figure 2A ) . Plots of the observed rate constants for the fast phases of the two reactions versus coﬁlin concentration had similar slopes of 2 . 8 m M 2 1 s 2 1 for pyr - enyl ADP - actin ﬁlaments and 2 . 4 m M 2 1 s 2 1 for pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex bound to ADP - actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 2C ) . Coﬁlin brought about a change in the ﬂuorescence of pyrenyl - ADP - P i - actin ﬁlaments faster than the change in the ﬂuorescence of pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex ﬂuorescence bound to ADP - P i - actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 2B ) . The observed rate constant for the fast phase of the pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex ﬂuorescence change showed a linear dependence of 0 . 13 m M 2 1 s 2 1 on coﬁlin concentrations , whereas the observed rate constants showed a dependence of 0 . 32 m M 2 1 s 2 1 on coﬁlin concentration at the same concentrations of pyrenyl - ADP - actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 2C ) . Effect of Coﬁlin on Equilibrium Binding of Arp2 / 3 Complex to Actin Filaments To learn more about the basis for the rapid change in the ﬂuorescence of pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex upon addition of coﬁlin , we measured the effect of coﬁlin on equilibrium binding of 600 nM pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex to ADP - actin ﬁlaments . In control experiments without coﬁlin , the ﬂuorescence of pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex increased with the concentration of actin ﬁlaments and saturated at about 20 m M polymerized actin ( Figure 3A ) . We interpret this as pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex binding to the ﬁlaments . The hyperbolic dependence of frac - tional saturation of the ﬂuorescence change on polymerized actin concentration gave a K d of 2 m M , or a K DR ( afﬁnity for binding sites composed of three subunits ) of 0 . 55 m M without coﬁlin .

( A and B ) Conditions for ADP - actin ﬁlaments : 1 or 5 m M pyrenyl - ATP - actin was polymerized at 22 (cid:2) C for 1 hr in 10 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM Tris - HCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 . ( C and D ) Conditions for ADP - P i actin ﬁlaments : 1 m M ( C ) or 5 m M ( D ) pyrenyl - ATP - actin was polymerized at 22 (cid:2) C for 1 hr as in ( A ) and ( B ) but with 15 . 4 mM H 2 KPO 4 , 9 . 6 mM HK 2 PO 4 , and 20 mM KCl rather than 50 mM KCl . Current Biology Vol 19 No 7 538 We then measured binding of pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex to actin ﬁlaments with four levels of coﬁlin occupancy ( 10 % , 20 % , 30 % , and 45 % ) over the range of actin concentrations . Arp2 / 3 complex binds to three consecutive actin subunits , so we adjusted the actin concentration to reﬂect the number of 3 - monomer sites available for binding as coﬁlin occupies 10 % – 45 % of the ﬁlament ( Equation 3 ) . Filaments 10 % saturated with coﬁlin bound Arp2 / 3 complex similarly to bare actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 3A ) with a K DR of 0 . 66 m M . When coﬁlin occupied more than 20 % of the subunits , the ﬂuorescence change of pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex was less at each actin concentration than with bare actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 3A ) and the ﬂuorescence change did not saturate at 20 m M actin 20 % – 45 % occupied by coﬁlin . Assuming that these curves saturate at the same ﬂuorescence as the control , ﬁts of the data to hyperbolas gave K DR s of 0 . 87 m M with 20 % coﬁlin satu - ration , 1 . 5 m M with 30 % coﬁlin saturation , and 2 . 5 m M with 45 % coﬁlin saturation ( Figure 3A ) . We also tested equilibrium binding of 600 nM pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex to 5 m M ADP - actin ﬁlaments occupied with a range of coﬁlin densities ( Figure 3B ) . Without coﬁlin , the ﬂuorescence indicated that 70 % of Arp2 / 3 complex bound to bare actin Figure 2 .

Filled circles : Experimental observations with 600 nM pyrenyl Arp2 / 3 complex , 5 m M ADP - actin ﬁlaments , and a range of coﬁlin concentrations incubated in KEMI - F buffer for 24 hr at 4 (cid:2) C . The fraction of actin - bound Arp2 / 3 complex was calculated from the increase in ﬂuorescence relative to the initial value . The dashed line is a theoretical calculation of fraction bound Arp2 / 3 complex assuming direct competition between Arp2 / 3 complex and coﬁlin for actin ﬁlaments . Here coﬁlin competes solely by limiting the number of 3 - subunit binding sites for Arp2 / 3 complex by a factor of ( 1 2 c ) 1 . 94 as described in Equation 5 and Figure S1 . Arp2 / 3 complex has a constant afﬁnity ( K DR = 0 . 67 m M ) for ﬁlaments whereas coﬁlin associates with increasing afﬁnity ( K d = 8 . 2 m M to 0 . 11 m M ) , as calculated from the fractional occupancy and free coﬁlin concentration in Equation 7 . The solid line is another theoretical calculation of fraction bound Arp2 / 3 complex assuming both competition for binding sites ( Equation 5 ) and a coﬁlin - induced structural propagation in the ﬁlament that increases the afﬁnity of coﬁlin ( K d = 8 . 2 m M to 0 . 11 m M ) and decreases theafﬁnity ofArp2 / 3complex ( K DR = 0 . 67 m Mto 23 m M , calculatedfromEquation 6 ) foractinﬁlaments as ﬁlaments change fromzero tofullcoﬁlin occupancy . Coﬁlin Dissociates Actin Branches 539 ﬁlaments . The ﬂuorescence declined hyperbolically with coﬁlin occupancy to a level corresponding to only 5 % of Arp2 / 3 complex bound to ﬁlaments more than 80 % saturated with coﬁlin . Judging from the ﬂuorescence of pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex , about 5 % of Arp2 / 3 complex remained bound to actin ﬁlaments in coﬁlin concentrations as high as 60 m M , where coﬁlin nearly fully occupied the ﬁlaments . Coﬁlin Induces Rapid Loss of Actin Filament Branches We used TIRF microscopy to visualize the effect of coﬁlin on branched ﬁlaments in real time ( Figures 4A and 4B ; Movies S1 – S4 available online ) . We grew branched actin ﬁlaments from 2 m M 40 % Oregon green - labeled ATP - actin with 40 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and 120 nM of its activator Wsp1p - VCA . Fila - ments elongated at a steady rate of 10 subunits / s , and growing branches began to appear after about 45 s . When a sufﬁcient number of branched ﬁlaments were present , we washed out actin , Arp2 / 3 complex , and Wsp1p - VCA with solutions con - taining a range of concentrations of coﬁlin and observed the consequences . All concentrations of coﬁlin tested ( 150 pM – 10 m M ) severed actin ﬁlaments , with the rate of severing and the time course of severing events depending on the coﬁlin concentration [ 6 , 18 ] . We observed a single severing event with 150 pM coﬁlin ( Movie S1 ) . Above 1 nM coﬁlin the rate of severing increased to a maximum in the range of 10 – 50 nM coﬁlin ( Movie S2 ; Figure 4D ) . At these low coﬁlin concentrations , severing per - sisted throughout observations at a steady rate of 0 . 6 – 1 . 3 3 10 2 3 severing events / m m actin / s until the ﬁlament became very short . As previously observed when images were acquired every 10 s [ 6 ] , coﬁlin concentrations greater than 100 nM did not sever ﬁlaments persistently over time . Figure 4 .

( D ) Dependence of the severing and debranching rates on the coﬁlin occupancy of the actin ﬁlaments during the ﬁrst 30 s after adding coﬁlin . Rates are the total number of observed severing and debranching events divided by the time of observation ( 30 s ) . Current Biology Vol 19 No 7 540 However , we observed a new feature by acquiring images every second . During the ﬁrst few seconds after ﬂowing high concentrations of coﬁlin through the observation chamber , we observed severing by coﬁlin concentrations as high as 5 m M ( Movie S4 ) . At 100 nM coﬁlin , 33 % of all severing events occurred within 4 s of coﬁlin addition , whereas at 5 m M 50 % of severing happened within 2 s ( Movie S4 ) . With 50 nM coﬁlin , an average ﬁlament was severed 6 – 7 times within 30 s after intro - duction of coﬁlin ( Movie S2 ) , producing short ﬁlaments of only a few hundred subunits . With 75 nM coﬁlin , a typical ﬁlament severed 4 – 5 times and coﬁlin greater than 100 nM severed only 2 – 3 times ( Movie S3 ) , leaving them as longer ﬁlaments of variable lengths . Our results agree with previous studies [ 6 , 18 ] where severing is stronger at low rather than high densi - ties of coﬁlin on the ﬁlaments . Actin ﬁlament branches disappeared rapidly in the presence of coﬁlin . We identiﬁed branch points by their ‘‘y’’ shape and scored their loss when a protruding arm disappeared from one frame to the next . The rate and extent of branch point destruction increasedwithcoﬁlin concentration ina hyperbolic fashion ( Figure 4D ) , quite distinct from the peak of severing activity at low coﬁlin concentrations . The fraction of branch points surviving for 30 s decreased with coﬁlin concentration ( Figure 4C ) . In 200 nM coﬁlin , the fraction of surviving branches declined from more than 40 % of branches at 10 s to only 10 % in 30 s . Thus , high nanomolar concentrations are sufﬁcient for debranching . At micromolar concentrations , branches disap - pear on a second time scale , with 80 % of branches lost within 5 s in 5 m M coﬁlin , similar to the rapid loss of pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex ﬂuorescence in these concentrations of coﬁlin ( Figure 2A ) . Coﬁlin concentrations above 5 m M did not increase the rate of branch dissociation or reduce the fraction of surviving branch points below 10 % . Discussion Our key ﬁnding is that coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments strongly promotes dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complex and actin - ﬁlament branches mediated by Arp2 / 3 complex . We propose that coﬁ - lin induces dissociation by decreasing the afﬁnity of Arp2 / 3 complex for actin ﬁlaments by at least 5 - fold as coﬁlin binds and stabilizes the 162 (cid:2) short - pitch helix conformation of the ﬁlament . The g - phosphate of ATP is an intrinsic inhibitor of coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments , so its dissociation is a key event facilitating the process . Here we consider how the occu - pancy of coﬁlin binding sites on actin ﬁlaments inﬂuences the properties of the ﬁlament , binding of Arp2 / 3 complex , and the stability of branches . Mechanism of Cooperative Binding of Coﬁlin to Actin Filaments Coﬁlins bind both actin monomers and ﬁlaments , with higher afﬁnities for ADP - actin than ATP - or ADP - P i - actin [ 8 , 19 ] . It decreases the distance between ﬂuorescent probes attached to Gln 41 ( in subdomain 2 ) and Cys374 ( in subdomain 1 ) in monomeric actin [ 20 ] . In an ATP - actin - twinﬁlin cocrystal , the C - terminal ADF - H domain interacts with the hydrophobic groove between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin through an a - helix containing many residues conserved among ADF / coﬁ - lins [ 21 ] . Coﬁlin bound to this site in an actin ﬁlament would displace the DNase I binding loop of the adjacent subunit along the long - pitch actin helix , favoring a more tightly twisted 162 (cid:2) conformation observed by electron microscopy [ 13 , 22 , 23 ] and weaken contacts along the long - pitch helix [ 24 – 26 ] . Radiolytic protein foot printing [ 27 ] and competitive crosslink - ing studies [ 28 ] support this conclusion . Binding to this site also allosterically closes the nucleotide binding cleft between subdomains 2 and 4 of actin [ 24 ] . Coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments strongly favors a conforma - tion with a 162 (cid:2) short - pitch helix [ 13 ] and vice versa . The twist of actin ﬁlaments is intrinsically variable [ 29 , 30 ] , but the short - pitch helical twist of bare actin ﬁlaments is about 167 (cid:2) except for rare segments with a 162 (cid:2) conformation [ 31 ] . The paucity of these 162 (cid:2) segments was proposed to explain the very slow rate of coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments [ 8 ] . Coﬁlin binding to rare subunits in the 162 (cid:2) state shifts the equilibrium of an unknown number of neighboring subunits toward the 162 (cid:2) state [ 31 ] and increases the microsecond torsional ﬂexibility and intersubunit angular disorder of actin ﬁlaments [ 32 , 33 ] . Local propagation of the 162 (cid:2) state around sites of coﬁlin binding and the higher afﬁnity of coﬁlin for subunits in the 162 (cid:2) state explain cooperative binding , as observed in equilib - rium binding experiments [ 5 , 13 , 15 ] , micrographs of ﬁlaments having bare and coﬁlin - decorated segments [ 13 ] and in time course of coﬁlin binding ( Figure 1 ) [ 16 ] . We estimate that coﬁlin binding to the 162 (cid:2) state is favored by 2 – 3 orders of magnitude over the 167 (cid:2) state , consistent with other estimates of the ability of coﬁlin to shift ﬁlaments from a small fraction of subunits in the 162 (cid:2) state to a majority of subunits in the 162 (cid:2) state [ 31 ] . Coﬁlin binds slower to ﬁlaments of ADP - P i - actin than ADP - actin . The presence of phosphate in the nucleotide cleft may directly slow coﬁlin binding or propagation of the struc - tural change . Coﬁlin accelerates release of the g - phosphate from ADP - P i actin ﬁlaments [ 8 ] , but the actual rate constant is not known . Thus , phosphate dissociation may limit the rate of coﬁlin binding to ADP - P i ﬁlaments and propagation of the conformational change along the ﬁlament . Alternatively , the equilibrium between 162 (cid:2) state and 167 (cid:2) state may be less favorable for coﬁlin binding to ADP - P i ﬁlaments than ADP actin ﬁlaments . Mechanism of Arp2 / 3 Complex Dissociation by Coﬁlin Mixing coﬁlin with actin ﬁlaments decorated with pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex causes the ﬂuorescence to decline orders of magnitude faster than when Arp2 / 3 complex spontaneously dissociates . Our interpretation is that dissociation of pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex from the actin ﬁlament causes the ﬂuores - cence change , because the magnitude of the change is comparable to the ﬂuorescence change when Arp2 / 3 complex binds to ﬁlaments . Alternatively , coﬁlin might induce confor - mational changes in the mother ﬁlament that reduce the quantum yield of bound pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex , but the pyrene on C167 of ARPC2 is deeply buried in the interface between Arp2 / 3 complex and the mother ﬁlament in 3D recon - structions of branch junctions from electron tomography [ 34 ] . It is unlikely that a conformational change in the actin ﬁlament could decrease the quantum yield 6 - fold to the level of unbound Arp2 / 3 complex without inﬂuencing the afﬁnity of the ﬁlament for Arp2 / 3 complex , so we performed a titration experiment to investigate how coﬁlin displaces Arp2 / 3 complex . We considered two potentially complementary mechanisms for coﬁlin displacing Arp2 / 3 complex from actin ﬁlaments , because our equilibrium analysis shows that coﬁlin not only occludes binding sites , but also decreases the afﬁnity Arp2 / 3 complex has for unoccupied sites . The ﬁrst mechanism assumes that coﬁlin competes directly with Arp2 / 3 complex Coﬁlin Dissociates Actin Branches 541 for polymerized actin subunits . The second is that coﬁlin binding propagates a structural change along the actin ﬁla - ment that reduces the afﬁnity of the ﬁlament for Arp2 / 3 complex . The following analysis concludes that both mecha - nisms contribute to the effect of coﬁlin on equilibrium binding ( Figure 3 ) of Arp2 / 3 complex to actin ﬁlaments . However , Arp2 / 3 complex naturally dissociates so slowly from actin ﬁla - ments ( k - = 1 . 0 3 10 2 3 s 2 1 [ 17 ] ) that direct competition cannot be involved when coﬁlin rapidly dissociates Arp2 / 3 complex from ﬁlaments in our kinetics experiments ( Figure 2 ) . Model for Direct Competition The methods section derives the Equations 3 – 6 describing direct competition between coﬁlin and Arp2 / 3 complex for binding actin ﬁlaments . In these equations , c is the fractional occupancy of actin subunits by coﬁlin . The model takes into account the fact that Arp2 / 3 complex binds to three succes - sive actin subunits along the long pitch strand of a ﬁlament [ 34 ] . Therefore , direct competition with coﬁlin bound to a ﬁla - ment reduces the number of binding sites of Arp2 / 3 complex on the ﬁlament in proportion to ( 1 2 c ) 3 , whereas stochastic simulations show that the binding capacity decreases by approximately ( 1 2 c ) 1 . 94 ( Figure S1 ) . The model also takes into account cooperative binding of coﬁlin to actin ﬁlaments . Solution of these equations shows that at equilibrium direct competition with cooperative binding of coﬁlin to ﬁlaments reduces binding sites for Arp2 / 3 complex with a convex dependence on coﬁlin occupancy ( Figure 3B , dashed line ) , quite different from the observed concave dependence of pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex ﬂuorescence on coﬁlin occupancy . Dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complex by direct competition for binding sites requires higher coﬁlin concentrations ( Figure 3B , dashed line ) than observed ( Figure 3B , open symbols ) even with cooperative binding of coﬁlin to actin ﬁlaments , because coﬁlin and Arp2 / 3 complex have similar afﬁnities for ADP - actin ﬁlaments ( 0 . 11 – 8 m M and 2 m M ) . Model for a Propagated Conformational Change Since subsaturating densities of coﬁlin dissociate the majority of bound Arp2 / 3 complex from ADP - actin ﬁlaments in equilib - rium experiments ( Figure 3B ) , and since coﬁlin displaces Arp2 / 3complexmuchfasterthanitsnaturalrateofdissociation in transient kinetic experiments , we considered a second mechanism whereby coﬁlin binding propagates a conforma - tionalchangeallostericallyalongﬁlamentstoreducetheafﬁnity for Arp2 / 3 complex . We assumed that coﬁlin binding to a ﬁla - ment reduces the effective binding capacity by ( 1 2 c ) 1 . 94 and also exponentially attenuates the afﬁnity for Arp2 / 3 complex for unoccupied actin subunits . We assumed that the K DR increasesfrom0 . 55 m Mforbareactinﬁlamentsto2 . 5 m Mforﬁla - ments 45 % occupied with coﬁlin , as observed ( Figure 3A ) , and to 20 m M when fully occupied as predicted by the exponential change in afﬁnity in the equilibrium experiment ( Equation 6 ) . Solution of these equations gives a theoretical curve that agrees with the observed reduction in pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex ﬂuorescence as a function of coﬁlin occupancy in equilibrium experiments ( Figure 3B , solid line ) . This mechanism also explains how coﬁlin can dissociate Arp2 / 3 complex from ﬁla - ments much faster than Arp2 / 3 complex equilibrates on and off of ﬁlaments . Insufﬁcient time is available for coﬁlin to compete for binding sites , but a conformational change can propagate rapidly to Arp2 / 3 complex from adjacent coﬁlin binding sites . The model of the branch junction based on EM tomography [ 34 ] offers a physical mechanism for coﬁlin dissociating Arp2 / 3 complex . Three subunits of the mother actin ﬁlament are locally untwisted to form a complex interface with Arp2 / 3 complex . Coﬁlin binding to adjacent sites may twist the mother ﬁlament in the opposite direction to decrease the afﬁnity of the ﬁlament for Arp2 / 3 complex by 5 - fold at half saturation and w 30 - fold when fully saturated , above and beyond any direct competition . The dependence of the afﬁnity of Arp2 / 3 complex for actin ﬁlaments on coﬁlin occupancy balances the free energy change needed for cooperative binding of coﬁlin to actin . Dissociation of counter ions provides the free energy for coﬁlin to bind cooperatively to ADP - actin ﬁlaments [ 16 ] . A decrease in afﬁnity of Arp2 / 3 complex for sites consisting of three actin subunits from 0 . 55 m M to 20 m M gives rise to a D G of roughly 2 12 kJ / mol , balancing the positive D G needed for cooperative coﬁlin binding . Coﬁlin binding to ADP - actin ﬁlaments and dissociation of pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex follow similar time courses and dependence on the concentration of coﬁlin ( Figure 2B ) , so the effect of coﬁlin binding is transmitted rapidly to Arp2 / 3 complex . In contrast , coﬁlin dissociates Arp2 / 3 complex 20 - fold slower from ADP - P i - actin ﬁlaments than from ADP ﬁlaments , whereas it binds ADP - P i - actin ﬁlaments only 4 - fold slower than ADP ﬁlaments . The lag between coﬁlin binding and dissociation could be due to a rate - limiting intermediate step , possibly P i release , which follows structural propagation but precedes conformational change in subunit that dimin - ishes Arp2 / 3 complex afﬁnity . Coﬁlin binding might also affect the rate of ATP hydrolysis and P i release from Arp2 , which is a prerequisite in dissociation of the complex [ 35 ] . Mechanism of Debranching We hypothesize that debranching results from coﬁlin - induced dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complex from the mother ﬁlament . Low occupancy of a ﬁlament by coﬁlin promotes some dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complex and branches , so concentrations of coﬁlin far below the K d dissociate branches ( Figure 4 ) . Even low nanomolar concentrations of coﬁlin dissociate some branches at 15 % the maximal rate , destroying 5 % of branch points per second . The rate of debranching increased hyperbolically with coﬁlin concentration into the micromolar range , where coﬁlin binds ADP - actin ﬁlaments and dissociates Arp2 / 3 complex and branches on a subsecond time scale . When coﬁlin occupies ﬁlaments at the same density , Arp2 / 3 complex and branches dissociate at similar rates . For example , at 40 % coﬁlin occupancy , pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex ﬂuorescence decreased with an observed rate constant of 7 s 2 1 and the majority of branch points were destroyed in 3 s , which , at an average of 25 branch points per sample , corresponds to a dissociation rate constant of 7 . 5 s 2 1 . This rate of branch dissociation with coﬁlin is about 35 - fold faster than the natural rate of dissociation branches originating from ADP - actin ﬁlaments ( 0 . 2 s 2 1 ) in the absence of coﬁlin [ 36 ] . In addition to these effects on the mother ﬁlament , actions of coﬁlin on daughter ﬁlaments may also inﬂuence branch stability [ 12 ] . Weak binding of coﬁlin to ADP - P i subunits in daughter ﬁlaments promotes dissociation of P i and conversion to ADP - actin . This may promote dissociation of daughter ﬁla - ments from Arp2 / 3 complex at branch junctions , as indicated by the fact that the afﬁnity of Arp2 / 3 complex for the pointed ends of ADP - actin daughter ﬁlaments is 25 - fold lower than for ATP - actin ﬁlaments [ 12 ] . Mechanism of Severing In agreement with previous work [ 6 , 18 , 25 ] , we observed that concentrations of about 10 nM S . pombe coﬁlin sever Current Biology Vol 19 No 7 542 ﬁlaments at the highest rate . Prolonged severing is optimal at low concentrations of coﬁlin where low occupancy of the ﬁla - ments creates boundaries between different twist states where severing is favored . We also observed a transient phase of severing at coﬁlin concentrations into the micromolar range , corresponding to the time when low densities of coﬁlin occupy the ﬁlaments . With time , the gaps between coﬁlins are ﬁlled in and the ﬁlament is stable in the 162 (cid:2) twist state . Kinetic and Biochemical Pathways to Sequential Effects of Coﬁlin at the Leading Edge of Cells The effects of coﬁlin binding on the rates of phosphate disso - ciation from ADP - P i - actin [ 8 ] , branch dissociation , and severing help to explain the spatial and temporal transition from branched to unbranched ﬁlaments about 1 m m behind the leading edge of motile cells [ 37 ] . Newly formed ATP - actin ﬁlament branches inevitably age by the following reactions . ( 1 ) Polymerized actin hydrolyzes bound ATP at 0 . 3 s 2 1 [ 8 ] . ( 2 ) Coﬁlin binds cooperatively but weakly to ADP - P i actin ﬁla - ments ( 0 . 45 m M 2 1 s 2 1 ) and ( 3 ) slowly dissociates Arp2 / 3 complex ( 0 . 13 m M 2 1 s 2 1 ) as the 162 (cid:2) state propagates locally . ( 3 ) Coﬁlin increases the rate of spontaneous dissociation of g - phosphate from 0 . 002 s 2 1 [ 38 ] to at least 0 . 035 s 2 1 [ 8 ] allow - ing ( 4 ) coﬁlin to bind faster ( 1 . 8 m M 2 1 s 2 1 ) , with 10 - to 15 - fold higher afﬁnity [ 8 ] to ADP - actin ( w 0 . 5 m M ) on a subsecond time scale . Coﬁlin’s induction and propagation of the 162 (cid:2) twist state allows small numbers of bound coﬁlins to promote dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complex and branches . In addition to these kinetic effects largely intrinsic to actin and coﬁlin , other actin - binding proteins such as Aip1 [ 39 ] surely contribute to the spatial regulation of the actin ﬁlament network to produce a narrow zone of branches that mature into long unbranched ﬁlaments . The formation of long unbranched ﬁlaments is the most mysterious aspect of the process . Depending on concentrations of broken ends , capping protein , proﬁlin and tropomyosin , rapid annealing of severed fragments of ﬁlaments [ 40 ] may contribute . Annealed ﬁlaments may resist severing because of association with tropomyosin [ 41 – 43 ] and possibly because local coﬁlin concentrations are too high for effective severing . A biochemical gradient of active coﬁlin that is highest near the leading edge may augment these kinetic effects . The combined activity of inhibitory phosphoinositides in the plasma membrane [ 44 ] and localized activation by dephos - phorylation of coﬁlin [ 45 – 47 ] may create such a gradient . PIP 2 can sequester coﬁlin from actin . LIM - kinase spread throughout the cytoplasm [ 48 ] phosphorylates a serine near the N terminus [ 49 , 50 ] and blocks coﬁlin from binding either actin monomers or ﬁlaments [ 12 ] . Slingshot phosphatase concentrated near the leading edge [ 51 , 52 ] may dephosphor - ylate and activate coﬁlin [ 47 ] . Farther from the leading edge , phosphorylation may reduce the concentration of active coﬁ - lin , enabling effective severing and recycling of ﬁlaments into monomers . Experimental Procedures Protein Puriﬁcation and Labeling Actin was puriﬁed from acetone powder of chicken skeletal muscle , gel ﬁltered through an S - 300 column in G - buffer ( 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1mMCaCl 2 , 1mMNaN 3 , 2mMTris - HCl [ pH8 . 0 ] ) [ 53 ] andlabeledwithpyr - ene [ 54 ] orOregongreeniodoacetemide [ 55 ] . Recombinant S . pombe coﬁlin was expressed from a pMW172 plasmid in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells [ 8 , 56 ] and puriﬁed by size - exclusion and ion - exchange chromatography . GST - WASp - VCA was expressed from a pGEX6T plasmid in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells and puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography followed by Source Q ion - exchange chromatography [ 17 ] . Arp2 / 3 complex was puriﬁed from S . pombe double mutant strain ARPC2 A317C - ARPC4 C167S and labeled with pyrene [ 17 ] . Chemicals KCl , MgCl 2 , EGTA , imidazole , CaCl 2 , ATP , DTT , NaN 3 , Tris , methylcellulose , catalase , and glucose oxidase were purchased from Sigma . Pyrene iodoa - cetamide and Oregon green iodoacetamide were purchased from Invitro - gen . Fluorescence Assays Experiments were performed with an Alphascan ﬂuorimeter ( Photon Technology International ) equipped with a MiniMixer stopped - ﬂow mixer ( KinTek ) , with excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 nm and 390 nm , at 100 counts per second . Pyrenyl - actin monomers were polymer - ized in 10 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 2 mM Tris - HCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 , and 50 mM KCl ( KMEI - F buffer ) or 19 . 9 mM KCl with 9 . 63 mM H 2 KPO 4 and 15 . 37 mM HK 2 PO 4 ( MEI - F buffer ) for 1 hr at 22 (cid:2) C to generate ADP and ADP - P i ﬁlaments . Unlabelled actin ﬁla - ments for measuring dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complex were polymerized in the presence of 600 nM pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex in similar conditions . In both assays , time courses of ﬂuorescence emission upon rapid mixing with coﬁlin were ﬁt to double exponentials to give the observed rate constants . Equilibrium Binding of Pyrenyl Arp2 / 3 Complex to Actin Filaments ADP actin ﬁlaments generated as above were mixed with coﬁlin to achieve desired occupancy and incubated overnight at 4 (cid:2) C . Pyrenyl - Arp2 / 3 complex ( 600 nM ) was included in overnight incubations for equilibrium assays or added just prior to measurements in kinetic assays . The concen - tration of coﬁlin added was calculated from the desired fractional occupancy ( v ) multiplied by the concentration of actin plus the concentra - tion of free coﬁlin [ L ] at that occupancy . The free ligand concentration [ L ] was estimated from mathematical rearrangement of the Scatchard format equation for the McGhee - Von Hippel unlimited nearest neighbor coopera - tivity model , where v is the desired occupancy , K a = 0 . 115 m M 2 1 , and coop - erativity factor u = 8 . 5 [ 6 , 15 ] . Alternatively , fractional occupancy ( v ) was calculated with the same equations if the total coﬁlin concentration was known . ½ cofilin (cid:3) total = ½ actin (cid:3) * v + ½ L (cid:3) Equation 1 (cid:2) L (cid:3) = 4 v ð 1 2 v Þ K a (cid:4) 1 2 2 v + ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ð 1 2 2 v Þ 2 + 4 wv ð 1 2 v Þ q (cid:6) 2 Equation 2 The afﬁnity of Arp2 / 3 complex for binding sites consisting of three actin subunits ( K DR ) at each of the coﬁlin occupancy ( c ) tested was ﬁtted to the followingequation , whichreﬂectsthedecreaseintheeffectiveconcentration of 3 - subunit actin sites as coﬁlin occupies a ﬁlament as suggested by stochastic simulations ( Figure S5 ) . The coefﬁcient of 3 arises from the theo - retical concentration of 3 - subunit binding sites as [ actin ] / 3 at zero coﬁlin occupancy , whereas the factor of 0 . 83 accounts for the probabilistic reduc - tionineffectivebindingcapacityresultingfromimperfectalignmentofArp2 / 3 complexes with solitary or consecutive unoccupied subunits in between . R R 0 = 0 : 83 ð 1 2 c Þ 1 : 94 ½ actin (cid:3) 3 K DR + 0 : 83 ð 1 2 c Þ 1 : 94 ½ actin (cid:3) Equation 3 Analysis of Competitive Binding between Coﬁlin and Arp2 / 3 Complex We estimated the concentration of actin - bound Arp2 / 3 complex ( F ) over a range of coﬁlin concentrations by comparing the end ﬂuorescence values ( F end ) , arisingfromassociationofpyrenyl - Arp2 / 3complextoactinﬁlaments , with that of a sample with 20 m M actin and no coﬁlin ( F sat ) , because equilib - rium binding suggests it to be a saturating condition where ﬂuorescence increases 5 - fold . F 0 is the ﬂuorescence value of Arp2 / 3 complex in the absence of actin . R R 0 = F end 2 F 0 F sat 2 F 0 Equation 4 Coﬁlin Dissociates Actin Branches 543 We modeled the concentration of Arp2 / 3 complex binding to ADP actin ﬁlaments with an equation that describes competitive binding R R 0 = 1 1 + 3 K DR 0 : 83 m ð 1 2 c Þ 1 : 94 ð n = 3 Þ Equation 5 where m = [ actin ] , c = coﬁlin occupancy , and K DR being K d s of Arp2 / 3 complex for 3 - monomer binding sites on actin ﬁlaments . Coﬁlin occupancy was estimated from Equations 1 and 2 . For the two theoretical curves , we either kept K DR constant at 0 . 55 m M , as predicted from equilibrium assays atzerocoﬁlinoccupancy , orvariedK DR exponentiallywithcoﬁlinoccupancy as suggested by observed K DR s in equilibrium assays ( Figure 3A ) . K DR = 0 : 647 e 3 : 8112 c Equation 6 The afﬁnity of coﬁlin for actin ﬁlaments changes with occupancy , so we estimated differential change in K d with q = ½ L (cid:3) K d + ½ L (cid:3) Equation 7 and experimental values for [ L ] ( coﬁlin concentration ) and q obtained in previous work [ 6 ] . The K d of coﬁlin ( K 2 ) ranged from 8 . 22 m M for bare ﬁlaments to 0 . 11 m M for fully occupied ﬁlaments in the equilibrium and competitive binding assays . Evanescent Wave Microscopy Experiments were performed in ﬂow cells made with Paraﬁlm strips as spacers between cleaned slides and 24 3 50 coverslips [ 55 , 57 ] . The proteins were in 1 3 TIRF buffer : 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 100 mM DTT , 15 mM glucose 0 . 5 % methyl cellulose , 20 m g / mL catalase , and 100 m g / mL glucose oxidase . Samples were excited by total internal reﬂection illumination at 488 nm and imageswere capturedwithanOrcaERC4742 - 95 CCDcamera ( Hamamatsu Corp . , Bridgewater , NJ ) controlled by Metamorph software ( Molecular Devices , Union City , CA ) on an Olympus IX70 microscope . Debranching Assay Flow cells were incubated with 2 volumes of 10 m l of 200 nM skeletal NEM - treatedmusclemyosinfor2min , followedbyahighsaltTRIS - buffered saline wash ( 50 mM TRIS [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 600 mM NaCl ) and 5 min incubation with Superblock ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . Chambers were equilibrated with one volume of 1 3 TIRF buffer prior to introduction of one volume of 200 nM VCA , 20 nM Arp2 / 3 complex , and 2 m M Mg - ATP - actin monomers ( 40 % labeled with Oregon green on cys374 ) prepared by incubation of Ca - ATP - actin for 5 min in Buffer G with 1 / 10 volume of 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA . During polymerization of actin , images were acquired every 10 s until sufﬁ - cient branches formed . Then we begin collecting images at one frame per second as we used capillary suction with a paper strip to replace the solu - tion in the chamber with coﬁlin in 1 3 TIRF buffer . We numbered all visible branch points in the frame before the coﬁlin started to ﬁll the chamber and designated the next frame as time zero for the debranching and severing reactions . We compared successive images to determine the times of severing and debranching , deﬁned as loss a protruding arm from the ‘‘y’’ shaped branch points . We measured rates of severing by summing events along each ﬁlament over up to 60 frames and dividing by the observation time and the total ﬁlament length to give an averaged severing rate per m m of ﬁlament . Stochastic Simulations Simulations were performed in Matlab , where a matrix of n 3 1 ( n = 5 , 000 , 10 , 000 , 15 , 000 , and 20 , 000 ) empty sites were successively ﬁlled randomly , one at a time with coﬁlin . The number of three consecutive empty sites , as well as the actual number of Arp2 / 3 complex that will ﬁt in the matrix ( binding sites ) , were surveyed after each successive ﬁll . The number of site conﬁgurations and the number of binding sites were plotted against fractional occupancy ( c ) , yielding a dependence of ( 1 2 c ) 3 and ( 1 2 c ) 1 . 94 , respectively .
