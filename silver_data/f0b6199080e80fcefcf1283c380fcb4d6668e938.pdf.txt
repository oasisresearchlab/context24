The transfer of molecules from the cell sur - face to the early endosomes is mediated by preendo - somal vesicles . These vesicles , which have pinched off completely from the plasma membrane but not yet fused with endosomes , form the earliest compartment along the endocytic route . Using a new assay to distin - guish between free and cell surface connected vesicle profiles , we have characterized the preendosomal com - partment ultrastructurally . Our basic experimental setup was labeling of the entire cell surface at 4°C with Con A - gold , warming of the ceils to 37°C to al - low endocytosis , followed by replacing incubation medium with fixative , all within either 30 or 60 s . Then the fixed cells were incubated with anti - Con A - HRP to distinguish truly free ( gold labeled ) endocytic vesicles from surface - connected structures . Finally , analysis of thin ( 20 - 30 nm ) serial sections and quanti - fication of vesicle diameters were carried out . Based on this approach it is shown that the preendosomal compartment comprises both clathrin - coated and non - coated endocytic vesicles with approximately the same frequency but with distinct diameter distributions , the average noncoated vesicle being smaller ( 95 nm ) than the average coated one ( 110 nm ) . In parallel experi - ments , using an anti - transferrin receptor gold - conjugate as a specific marker for clathrin - dependent endocytosis it is also shown that uncoating of coated vesicles plays only a minor role for the total frequency of noncoated vesicles . Furthermore , after perturbation of clathrin - dependent endocytosis by potassium depletion where uptake of transferrin is blocked , noncoated endocytic vesicles with Con A - gold , but not coated vesicles , ex - ist already after 30 and 60 s . Finally , it is shown that the existence of small , free vesicles in the short - time experiments cannot be ascribed to recycling from the early endosomes . NDOCYTOSIS of plasma membrane constituents and of molecules from the environment is essential to eu - karyote cells . Endocytosis is involved in diverse processes such as concentrative uptake of metabolites and carrier molecules , for instance LDL and transferrin ( 11 ) , downregulation of growth factor receptors with tyrosine ki - nase activity ( 4 , 52 ) , antigen processing and presentation ( 13 ) , as well as turn - over of resident plasma membrane con - stituents ( 2 , 21 ) . It is well established that many ligands and their transmembrane glycoprotein receptors are internalized via clathrin - coated pits and vesicles ( receptor - mediated en - docytosis ) , and the clathrin molecules together with as - sociated proteins such as adaptins ( 2 , 9 , 26 , 35 , 39 ) , as well as specific signal sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors ( 4 , 23 , 24 , 27 , 52 ) , play key roles in the process . The main characteristic of endocytosis from clathrin - coated pits seems to be the efficiency by which some selected mem - brane molecules are concentrated in the pits while others are excluded , the coated pits thus acting as molecular filters ( 1 ) . Plasma membrane , as well as bound molecules and solutes , may also be internalized in a clathrin - independent way . This has been approached in studies where the endocytic mecha - nism was analyzed morphologically by quantifying binding of labeled ligands to coated and noncoated domains of the plasma membrane ( 22 , 34 , 51 ) . Recently some very unusual mechanisms of clathrin - independent internalization of mole - cules have been reported , leading either directly to the endo - plasmic reticulum , bypassing the normal endosomal pathway ( 25 ) , or to a sequestration just below the plasma membrane in invaginations which apparently never detach completely from the plasma membrane ( 45 ) . In other experiments , the clathrin - dependent endocytosis was blocked efficiently by hypertonic solutions , potassium depletion , or acidification of the cytosol ( 17 , 18 , 28 , 30 , 36 , 38 , 47 , 49 ) . Nonetheless , uptake of fluid - phase markers and of ricin , which binds to cell surface receptors with terminal galactose , was only re - duced to some extent ( 30 , 36 , 38 , 47 ) . However , since the methods to selectively inhibit endocy - tosis involve nonphysiological conditions , objections may be raised against results obtained with these methods , and the existence of a clathrin - independent endocytic mechanism is therefore still a controversial issue deserving further atten - tion ( see references 2 , 7 , 12 , 21 , 44 ) . In cells where both mechanisms of endocytosis have been reported to operate , one would expect the existence of two ( or more ) distinct populations of early endocytic , or preendosomai , vesicles © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 91 / 05 / 731 / 11 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 113 , Number 4 , May 1991 731 - 741 731 simultaneously . Preendosomal vesicle is used here as an operational term for endocytic vesicles that have pinched off completely from the plasma membrane but not yet fused with ( preexisting ) endosomes or with other vesicles to form endosomes . Obviously , detailed electron microscopical anal - ysis of cells exposed to pulse - chase experiments using appro - priate markers during the pulse and very short chase peri - ods is required . In the present study , we have established a Con A - anti - Con A assay for short time endocytosis experi - ments and combined this with analysis of thin serial sections and quantification of vesicle diameters . In this way we have for the first time been able to visualize directly how the earli - est steps in endocytosis involve two distinct , preendosomal vesicle populations with different size distributions . One population is the typical clathrin - coated , the other popula - tion is clearly noncoated ( nonclathrin coated ) and has a smaller mean vesicle diameter ( 95 nm ) than the clathrin - coated vesicle population ( 110 nm ) . Materials and Methods Cell Culture HEp - 2 and A431 cells were maintained in Dulbecco ' s modification of Ea - gle ' s medium ( No . 12 - 332 - 54 , Flow Laboratories , Irvine , Scotland ) , con - taining 5 % ( HEp - 2 ) or 10 % ( A431 ) fetal calf serum ( No . 011 - 06290 M ; Gibco Ltd . , Paisley , Scotland ) and 2 mM L - glutamine ( No . 043 05030 ; Gibco Ltd . ) . T - 47D cells were propagated in RPMI - 1640 ( No . 12 - 602 - 54 ; Flow Laboratories ) supplemented with 10 % FCS , 2 mM gluatamine and 8 / ~ g / ml insulin ( 25 IU / mg ; Hagedorn Research Laboratory , Gentofte , Den - mark ) . For all cell types , cultures were grown in T - 25 flasks or 24 - well dis - posable trays ( NUNC , Roskilde , Denmark ) and used for experimentation at 50 - 80 % confluency and 1 d after a change of the medium . Biochemical Experiments Effect of Con A on Fluid - Phase Endocytosis of Sucrose . HEp - 2 cells grown in disposable trays were rinsed with ice - cold Hepes buffer and in - cubated with 0 - 10 / ~ g / ml Con A ( No . C2010 ; type IV ; Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) for 60 rain on ice with or without the addition of 2 mM N - ethyl maleimide ( NEM ; Sigma Chemical Co . ) during the last 10 min . Next , the cells were incubated with 8 ~ Ci / ml , 540 mCi / mmol , 14Csu - crose , for 20 min at 37°C , washed five times with ice - cold PBS , and in - cubated with 2 mg / ml protease ( No . 5147 , type XIV ; Sigma Chemical Co . ) for 60 min on ice . Finally , after centrifugation , the cell pellets were dis - solved in 0 . 1 M KOH and the radioactivity was measured . Effect of Potassium Depletion on Endocytosis of Con A and Transfer - r / n . HEp - 2 cells were depleted for potassium by first exposing them to hypotonic medium for 5 rain at 37 " C and then incubating them in a potassium - free buffer as earlier described ( 30 ) . Endocytosis of 125I - Con A was measured by removing the cell surface - bound lectin with c ~ - methyl - mannoside . The cells were incubated for 10 rain at 37 * C in the presence of 0 . 1 M ~ - methylmannoside , washed three times in the same solution , and then dissolved in 0 . 1 M KOH before the radioactivity was measured . ) 25I - Transferrin endocytosis was measured as previously described ( 6 ) . Con A - Anti - Con A Assay Cells were chilled and rinsed with PBS ( containing magnesium and cal - cium ) at 4°C . The cultures were then incubated at 4°C for 120 rain with 5 nm colloidal gold - labeled Con A ( No . L - 7390 ; Con A - gold ; Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) , which had been dialyzed against PBS and diluted with PBS to an OD520 = 0 . 5 ( 1 ml / T - 25 ) before use . After washing with PBS at 4 " C , the cells were incubated for 30 or 60 s at 37°C . To warm the cells rapidly , 7 . 5 ml of 37°C PBS were added per T - 25 flask and replaced once before immersing the flask in a 370C water bath . The clock timer was started at the first exposure to 37 " C PBS and the incubation was terminated by removal of warm PBS and addition of 5 ml ice - cold fixative consisting of 2 % formaldehyde , 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer pH 7 . 2 to each T - 25 flask which was immediately put on ice and subsequently trans - ferred to a 4°C room for 30 rain . Upon rinsing with PBS , fixed cultures were incubated with rabbit anti - Con A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( No . I ) 283 ; Dakopatts , Glostrup , Denmark ) in a 1 : 20 dilution in PBS for 60 rain at 220C . The specificity of the Con A - gold label was assessed by inclusion of either 5 mg / ml free Con A ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) or 2 mg / ml methyl a - D - mannopyranoside ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) during the incubation with Con A - gold . Transferrin Receptor Assay Using 8 nm gold - conjugated monoclonal mouse - anti - transferrin receptor antibody B3 / 25 ( kindly provided by Dr . Colin Hopkins , Department of Biochemistry , Imperial College of Science , Technology and Medicine , Lon - don ) this assay was performed according to the protocol for the Con A - anti - Con A assay , except for the use of a different HRP - conjugated antibody : rab - bit anti - mouse immanogloblulins / HRP ( No . P260 , Dakopatts ) . Recycling Assay Cultures were incubated for 15 min at 37°C with rabbit anti - Con A / HRP ( P283 ) , which before experimentation was ( a ) dialyzed against PBS , ( b ) supplemented with 10 % normal rabbit immunoglobulin , and ( c ) diluted 1 : 4 ( final dilution ) . The cultures were then transferred to 4 " C , rinsed thor - oughly with PBS , and subsequently incubated with Con A - gold for 120 min at 4°C , rinsed with PBS at 4 " C , and incubated further for 60 s or 15 min at 37°C as described above . After fixation , the cultures were processed for electron microscopy . Electron Microscopy HRP was visualized with diaminobenzidine and H202 as previously de - scribed ( 16 ) . Cells were pelleted by centrifugation , postfixed in 2 % OsO4 , contrasted en bloc with 1 % uranyl acetate , dehydrated , and embedded in Epon . Routinely , 40 - 50 - nm sections were collected on mesh grids ; for serial sectioning , 20 - 30 - nm sections were sampled on slot grids . In any case sections were examined in a Jeol 100 CX electron microscope without fur - ther contrasting . Quantification of Coated Vs . Noncoated Vesicle Frequency At least 150 cell profiles for the 60 - s chase and 300 cell profiles for the 30 - s chase were analyzed in each of the two assays . Thus the data presented in Table I are based on more than 900 cell profiles . All material in a given Epon section was included , since it is not known whether the composition of the preendosomal vesicle population varies in different parts of the cell , e . g . , the apical vs . the basal surface or the cell center vs . the cell processes . For the Con A - anti - Con A experiments , all vesicle profiles were counted and photographed ( for the size distribution analysis ) . In the transferrin receptor assay , with 30 - s chase , the first 78 vesicles were counted and pho - tographed ( for the size distribution analysis ) and the remaining 92 simply counted as for the data obtained with 60 - s chase .

Determination of Vesicle Diameter Distributions In the Con A - anti - Con A assay for 30 - and 60 - s chase , and in the transferrin receptor assay for 30 - s chase , randomly selected sections of HEp - 2 cells were examined in the EM at 16 - 26 , 000x and all vesicle profiles ( coated or noncoated ) containing only the gold label ( see Results ) ( 166 vesicles for the 30 - s chase and 204 vesicles for the 60 - s chase in the Con A - anti - Con A assay , and 78 vesicles for the 30 - s chase in the transferrin receptor assay ) were photographed at 26 , 000x . Micrographs were printed at a final magnification of 65 , 000x . Vesicle diameters , from center of membrane to center of membrane , thus excluding coat material , were measured with a Scale Lupe ( a 0 . 1 mm scale mounted on 10x magnification glass ) along a line drawn parallel to the baseline ( the long , horizontal edge ) of the print frame , and exactly at the same distance from the top and bottom of the vcsi - Hansen et al .

Since the vesi - cles are randomly oriented in relation to the print frame , by measuring the diameters of the round or elongated vesicles in one dimension parallel to a predetermined edge of the print frame ( the baseline ) , we obtain an ac - curate estimate of average diameters provided the number of measurements is adequate . Results The Con A - Anti - Con A Assay Since newly formed endocytic vesicles are not possible to identify in routine preparations for the electron microscope , an appropriate marker system is needed . The marker should not be selective for specialized plasma membrane domains such as coated pits , but associate randomly with the entire cell surface . Moreover , a vesicular profile in a thin section containing label is not necessarily a free vesicle , but may be connected with the cell surface at another plane of section - ing . For instance , serial section analysis revealed that most ( 60 - 90 % , depending on cell type ) of the coated vesicular profiles containing cationized ferritin were actually surface connected ( 40 ) . Finally , to focus on the earliest events in en - docytosis , that is , the formation of the primary endocytic vesicles , termed preendosomal in the present study , very short incubation times are required . We therefore established an assay making it possible to identify the preendosomal vesicles in the electron micro - scope . First , HEp - 2 cells were incubated at 4°C with a Con A - gold conjugate in order to obtain a marked gold labeling of the entire cell surface . The cells were then allowed to in - ternalize Con A - gold - tagged plasma membrane for very brief periods of time by replacing the cold medium with prewarmed medium at 37°C . After 30 or 60 s , this medium was rapidly replaced with ice - cold fixative and the cultures were immediately placed on ice . Hence the exact time in which the cells efficiently endocytosed Con A - gold is un - known , but it is definitely < 30 and 60 s , respectively . Next , in order to distinguish truly internalized label ( Con A - gold ) from that associated with the cell surface including invagina - tions of the plasma membrane , which in a random section may appear as free vesicles , the fixed cells were incubated with anti - Con A antibody conjugated to HRP . As shown in Fig . 1 , Con A - gold particles bound to the plasma membrane and membrane invaginations are sur - rounded by a distinct cloud of dark HRP reaction product . In this way many coated or noncoated vesicular profiles or profiles resembling typical endosomes were found to be sur - face connected ( Fig . 1 ) . The HRP - labeled anti - Con A anti - body clearly detected the Con A - gold even when this was localized in narrow spaces between adjacent cells or in struc - tures connected with the cell surface by narrow " necks " or slits . By contrast , truly free ( internalized ) vesicles contained only the gold label ( Fig . 1 ) . This was further established by analysis of thin serial sections ( see below ) in the electron mi - croscope , where a vesicular profile only containing gold la - bel was found in the midsection of the series , and then fol - lowed on either side and photographed in all the sections . Hence , 32 vesicular profiles with gold label but without any HRP were analyzed in thin serial sections and in no case could any surface connection be detected . Furthermore , no vesicular profiles containing only gold label could be found , when the chase at 37°C was omitted . The Con A - gold binding was specific . Hence , incubation with excess unlabeled Con A ( 5 mg / ml ) in addition to the Con A - gold probe resulted in almost no gold labeling of the cell surface , whereas HRP reaction product due to the anti - Con A antibody was indeed very distinct ( Fig . 1 ) . Also , in - clusion of methyl ol - D - mannopyranoside ( 2 mg / ml ) in the in - cubation step with Con A - gold almost completely prevented surface labeling both with gold and HRP . To test whether Con A itself induced endocytosis , cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of prebound Con A at 37°C for 20 min and the effect on fluid - phase up - take on ~ 4Csucrose was measured . As shown in Fig . 2 , Con A does not induce any measurable endocytosis even within 20 min . Thus the endocytic processes described in the present paper are constitutive , not induced . Characterization of Preendosomal Vesicle Populations After 30 and 60 s of incubation , coated and noncoated endo - cytic vesicles of various size were observed , mainly in the peripheral cytoplasm ( Figs . 3 - 6 ) . Serial section analysis re - vealed that the noncoated vesicles ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) , like the coated ones , were spherical . The frequencies of coated and noncoated vesicles labeled with Con A - gold after 30 - and 60 - s chase at 370C were roughly equal ( Table I ) . The mean vesicle diameters ( Tables II and 11 / ) suggested that the coated and noncoated vesicles were of similar size . However , the size distributions of the coated and noncoated vesicles shown in Figs . 7 and 8 revealed that this was not the case• It is seen that the noncoated vesicles tend to be smaller than the coated ones , both after 30 and 60 s . To test statistically whether the coated vesicle population was different from the noncoated population based on diameters , the two sets of data presented in Figs . 7 and 8 were analyzed by the Kolmogorov - Smirnov test . The test revealed that the difference between the di - ameter distributions of the two populations was significant with P < 0 . 001 and P < 0 . 01 for the 30 - and 60 - s chase , respectively . The main difference between the two time points is the increasing frequency of very large ( > 200 nm ) , un - coated vesicles after 60 s . If these vesicles , with a morphol - ogy of endosomes and with diameters above 200 nm , are omitted from the mean vesicle diameter calculation , the The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 113 , 1991 734 Figure 3 . Cells were incubated with Con A - gold at 4°C , warmed to 37 " C , and chased for 60 s . Then the cells were fixed and incubated with anti - Con A - HRP . Four examples of coated vesicles are shown ( arrows ) . Noncoated vesicle profiles are shown in a , c , and d ( open arrows ) for comparison . Even in the low - contrast sections it is easy to distinguish between coated and noncoated vesicle profiles ( see also Figs . 4 - 6 ) . A surface - connected , vesicle - like profile is seen in c ( asterisk ) . characteristic smaller size of the noncoated vesicle type as compared to the coated one becomes evident ( compare Ta - bles II and m ) . Using the Mann - Whitney test for comparing the size of coated and noncoated vesicles , the difference was significant with P < 0 . 0001 and P < 0 . 001 for the 30 - and 60 - s chase , respectively . Thus the data indicate that the average diameter of the noncoated preendosomal vesicle is ~ 15 nm smaller than the coated one . It should be noted that the vesicle diameters in general are underestimated , since in a given section the largest diameter of a vesicle may not be included . The Con A - anti - Con A assay was also applied to other cell types for 30 - and 60 - s intervals . Both in the human epider - moid carcinoma cell line A431 and in the human breast car - cinoma cell line T47D , preendosomal vesicles ( coated and noncoated ) similar to those described above were present . Uncoating of Clathrin - coated Vesicles To test whether the noncoated vesicles in the 75 - 175 - nm range ( Figs . 7 and 8 ) were actually formed by pinching off from the plasma membrane without coat , or whether they Hansen et al . Preendosomal Vesicles 735 Figure 4 . Three examples of noncoated vesicles ( arrows ) from an experiment similar to that in Fig . 3 . Nu , nucleus . represent previously coated vesicles which have shed the coat , we carried out experiments with monoclonal anti - trans - ferrin receptor ( TfR ) ~ - gold . The TfR is a widely - used , bona fide marker of the coated pit pathway for endocytosis ( 19 , 20 , 47 ) . When HEp - 2 cells were prelabeled at 4°C with anti - TfR - gold and then warmed to 37°C and fixed within 30 s as described above , followed by incubation with rabbit anti - mouse / HRP to distinguish between truly free vesicles and surface - connected vesicles , 45 out of 170 , or 26 % ( see Table I ) , of all free vesicles containing the gold label only were not coated . The ratio between uncoated and coated vesicle pro - files in the transferrin receptor assay is thus (cid:127)1 : 3 . Hence , since > 50 % of the vesicle profiles labeled with gold only in the Con A - anti - Con A assay were noncoated ( Table I ) , max - imally one - third of these are derived from coated vesicles . However , the one - third is most likely an overestimation of the role of vesicles " born " coated in the total noncoated vesi - cle frequency . It was striking that ~ 50 % of the noncoated vesicles recorded in the transferrin receptor assay ( Table III ) were either large vacuoles ( endosome - like ) or small tubular structures ( Fig . 9 ) , which are unlikely to be formed simply by uncoating of coated vesicles . They rather represent endo - somes , endosomal tubular extensions , and / or a few truly noncoated vesicles that by chance have internalized the trans - ferrin receptor . Similar results for the transferrin receptor assay were obtained when the chase was prolonged to 60 s ( Table I ) . Since there was no significant difference between 30 s and 60 s in the frequency of uncoated vesicles ( Table I ) , it is likely that a newly formed coated vesicle becomes uncoated within < 30 s , and that the lifetime of an uncoated vesicle ( i . e . , before fusion with endosomes ) is even shorter . Inhibition of Coated Vesicles by Potassium Depletion Studies by our group and others of HEp - 2 cells have shown 1 . Abbreviation used in this paper : TfR , transferrin receptor . that K÷ - depletion combined with a hypotonic shock ( 30 , 36 ) , as well as acidification of the cytosol ( 47 ) , efficiently in - hibits endocytosis of transferrin from coated pits by remov - ing or paralyzing them , respectively . In contrast , ricin up - take is only moderately reduced . We therefore intended to analyze , using the Con A - anti - Con A assay described above , the preendosomal vesicle populations in cells where the coated pit pathway was blocked . Using HEp - 2 cells , and be - cause we wanted to eliminate the clathrin coats completely rather than paralyzing them , the K÷ - depletion assay was chosen . Under the experimental conditions , the internaliza - tion of iodinated Con A during 20 rain was reduced only from 22 to 13 % ( of total cell - associated Con A ) , whereas accumulation of sucrose was reduced to about one - third ( 36 % ) of the control . This was as expected because of the smaller volume - to - surface ratio of the noncoated vesicles as compared to coated vesicles . In contrast , uptake of transfer - rin during 15 rain was reduced from 51 to 6 % ( data not shown ) . Thus , as in the case of ricin ( 30 , 36 , 47 ) , Con A be - comes internalized to a significant degree under conditions where uptake of transferrin is strongly reduced . With the Con A - anti - Con A assay applied to K÷ - depleted cells , only noncoated , free vesicles with gold label and the same di - ameter range as described above were detected after 30 - and 60 - s chase ( Fig . 10 ) . However , K + - depletion in combina - tion with the necessary cooling step and brief ( 60 s ) 37°C chase in the Con A - anti - Con A assay resulted in a 45 % reduction in the number of noncoated vesicles . These data indicate that the noncoated endocytic vesicles revealed with the Con A - anti - Con A assay under normal conditions also function in a situation where the coated pit pathway has been eliminated . Recycling Vesicles Previous studies have indicated that recycling vesicles ( i . e . , vesicles carrying membrane back to the plasma membrane from the endosomes - lysosomes ) are small , < 100 nm ( 53 ) , The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 113 , 1991 736 Figures 5 and 6 . Two examples of noncoated vesicles as revealed by serial sectioning ( arrows in Fig . 5 , b - e , and Fig . 6 , b - d ) , from an experiment similar to that in Fig . 3 . In Fig . 6 , d - f ( double arrows ) another noncoated vesicle is appearing . thus of a size similar to that of the average putative noncoated preendosomal vesicle . Since we observed some internalized Con A - gold in endosome - like vesicles already after 30 s , we had to consider the possibility that part of the noncoated Table II .

To test this possibility , we reversed the sequence of reagents in the Con A - anti - Con A assay using the anti - Con A / HRP antibody first as a fluid - phase marker for 15 min at 37°C to label endosomes and recycling vesicles , followed by Con A - gold for 120 min at 4°C before the final chase at 37°C . Recycling vesicles containing the gold label can be distinguished from gold - labeled endocytic vesicles by their content of HRP . Under these conditions , with a 60 - s chase , it was almost impossible to find the double - labeled recycling vesicles , although many gold - labeled coated and noncoated vesicular profiles were present in addition to endosomes con - taining significant amounts of HRP as well as gold particles ( Fig . 11 ) . After a 15 - min chase at 37°C , when extensive colocalization of the gold and HRP label was present in Hansen et al .

If such vesicles ( 5 in the 30s , and 10 in the 60s Con A - anti - Con A assay , and 2 in the transferrin receptor assay ) are excluded from the calculation of mean diameters it becomes evident that the noncoated vesicles are distinctly smaller than the coated vesicles in Table II . the endosome - like structures ( Fig . 11 ) , small double - labeled vesicular profiles could be detected , but their frequency was low . Thus the recycling assay devised in the present paper provides evidence that the contribution of recycling vesicles to the vesicle populations characterized by the Con A - anti - Con A assay was insignificant . Discussion In the present study we show that the preendosomal endo - cytic vesicle compartment contains two distinct vesicle pop - ulations : clathrin - coated vesicles ~ 110 nm in diameter , and noncoated ( i . e . , nonclathrin - coated ) * 95 nm in diameter , both types of vesicles occurring with approximately the same frequency . This supports previous studies reporting that when endocytosis from clathrin - coated pits has been in - hibited by K ÷ depletion ( 30 , 36 ) or acidification ( 47 ) , ricin is still internalized at a rate of - 40 - 80 % of the control value . Also , in the present study , uptake of Con A in K + - depleted cells was , , o59 % of the control value . Evidence that ( at least ) two separate endocytic pathways exist is now based not only on biochemical studies using nonphysiological conditions , 30s chase ¢ , 0 - ~ - 50 - 75 - 100 - 125 - 1N ) - ' 175 - 200 - 225 - 250 - 275 - 211111 - ~ - 350 Vesicle size categories in nanometers 60 s chase . _ - * 7 , o 0 - 25 - 50 . 75 - 100 - 125 - 150 - 175 - 200 - 225 - 250 - 275 . 300 . 325 - 350 Vesicle size categories in nanometers Figures 7and 8 .

Vesicle diameter was measured on the print as described in Ma - terials and Methods . The diameters of coated and noncoated vesi - cles were separately pooled in 25 - nm categories and the frequency of vesicles in each category was calculated .

After fixation , cell surface - associated anti - TfR - gold was detected using HRP - labeled rabbit anti - mouse immune - globulins . In this assay , anti - 1 ' tR - gold - labeled coated pits appearing as vesicles ( arrow in a ) are also HRP labeled and thereby distin - guished from true coated vesicles containing the anti - TfR - gold only ( arrow in b ) . Although the majority of the gold labeled vesicles in this assay were coated , a heterogenous noncoated vesicle popula - tion encompassing larger vacuoles or small tubular structures ( c and d ) was also found . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 113 , 1991 738 Figure 10 . The Con A - anti - Con A assay applied to cells exposed to combined hypotonic shock and potassium depletion which is known to perturb clathrin dependent endocytosis . Noncoated ( ar - rows ) but not coated vesicles containing only gold are found under these conditions ( a and b ) . Some larger vesicles ( asterisks in c ) are also gold labeled ( small arrows ) . In d a surface - connected vesicular profile ( open arrow ) containing both HRP and gold is shown . but also on quantitative morphological evidence obtained under nonperturbating conditions . It is necessary to stress here the importance of the term " preendosomal " vesicle . It refers strictly to the newly formed endocytic vesicle , immediately after it has pinched off from the plasma membrane but before any fusion events ( to give rise to early endosomes ) have taken place . The study of such vesicles obviously requires short - time experiments , such as those reported here . For technical reasons we find it un - warranted to use shorter periods of incubation at 37°C than 30 s . On the other hand , if one incubates cells for 3 - 5 rain ( a typical short time interval in most studies on endoeytosis ) , the ultrastructural pattern of smaller and larger vesicle pro - files representing preendosomal vesicles , endosomes , and tubulo - vesicular processes from these , recycling vesicles , etc . , becomes too complicated to allow any detailed analysis . Since few endocytic vesicles are formed during a 30 - 60 - s incubation at 37 " C ( see Table I ) , a marker molecule with a high number of cell surface binding sites is required . This requirement may not be essential when some of the proteins internalized selectively by the highly efficient coated pit path - way are studied , but it becomes absolute when the marker molecule must be nondiscriminative between different endo - eyrie mechanisms . As our results show the Con A - gold con - jugate fulfilled this requirement . The close relationship between coated and noncoated pits and their respective vesicular counterparts poses a problem of identifying the free vesicles in sections . The ultimate solu - tion for this problem is analysis of thin serial sections , where surface connections can be discovered or the integrity of vesicular profiles unequivocally documented ( 40 , 54 ) . How - ever , for quantitative studies where a large - scale analysis is necessary , an alternative , less time consuming approach is needed . Hence , we could justify to carry out quantitative analysis of endocytic vesicles on random single sections in our Con A - anti - Con A assay by initially documenting that vesicular profiles containing only the gold label in all cases examined by serial sectioning were truly free vesicles . It is well established that coated pits and vesicles are pri - Figure 1L Recycling assay performed by reversing the sequence of the Con A - anti - con A assay . Thus , ceils were incubated with anti - Con A - HRP for 15 min at 37°C , then chilled to 4 " C , rinsed , and further incubated with Con A - gold for 120 rain . Finally , after washing the cells , a chase was performed for 60 s or 15 min at 37°C . ( a ) After a 60 - s chase vesicle profiles , either endocytic or surface connected as revealed by their content of the gold marker only ( open arrow ) , are found in conjunction with HRP labeled endosomes ( asterisk ) contain - ing no or few gold particles ( arrowhead ) . ( b ) After 15 - min chase , the HRP - labeled endosomes also contain high numbers of gold particles ( asterisk ) . Putative recycling vesicles containing both the gold label and the HRP tag are found ( arrows ) as well as vesicular profiles contain - ing the gold label only ( open arrows ) . Hansen et al . Preendosomal Vesicles 739 madly involved in rapid and efficient ( concentrative ) uptake of a variety of transmembrane glycoprotein receptors and their physiological ligands ( 11 ) . Receptor internalization oc - curs constitutively when the receptors aggregate in coated pits also in the absence of ligands ( e . g . , LDL and transferrin receptors ) , or it can be induced by interaction with the ligands ( e . g . , receptors with tyrosine kinase activity such as the EGF receptor , 4 ) . On the other hand , clathrin - indepen - dent endocytosis seems to be involved in a less efficient , non - concentrative removal of resident plasma membrane pro - teins , or proteins that do not have a typical receptor function in ligand uptake ( a default pathway of internalization ; see references 2 , 21 ) . Major histocompatibility ( MHC ) molecules are of interest here . Thus , Huet et al . ( 22 ) reported that MHC class I molecules were internalized via noncoated pits at the plasma membrane , and in a recent study it was found that a small but significant fraction of surface MHC class II mole - cules is internalized , although the molecules are not present in coated pits ( 37 ) . Of interest is also a rather large family of proteins that do not cross the membrane lipid bilayer but are rather anchored to membrane glycolipids ( phosphotidyl - inositol - anchored proteins , PI - P ) . These molecules are also excluded from coated pits ( 1 ) . For instance the PI - P Thy - 1 , which is excluded from coated pits , is internalized , although very slowly ( 29 ) . However , an uptake rate of just 5 % per hour would make sense in relation to a slow turnover of resi - dent membrane proteins ( i . e . , proteins not designed for rapid internalization and recycling ) . Also , immunotoxins bound to Thy - 1 are internalized and intoxicate cells ( 31 ) . Another ex - ample of a PI - P is the decay accelerating factor of leucocytes that also seems to be internalized in a clathrin - independent way ( 50 ) . Membrane glycolipids may also need a slow , con - tinuous internalization , although at least some are excluded from coated pits . For instance , glycolipids with the gal ot 1 - 4 gal structure binding Shiga toxin are excluded from coated pits , unless the toxin is added ( 48 ) . In addition , several op - portunistic ligands of pathophysiological interest use , at least in part , a clathrin - independent mechanism to enter cells ( 47 , 51 , 56 ) . Whereas molecular motors involved in clathrin - dependent endocytosis are well established ( see Introduction ) , much less is known about the possible mechanisms involved in the formation of endocytic vesicles without clathrin . It is known , however , from studies on several cell types that growth fac - tors such as insulin , insulin - like growth factor - I , and EGF as well as the tumor - promoter 12 - 0 - tetradecanoyl - phorbol - 13 - acetat ( TPA ) induce membrane ruffling or other changes in surface architecture with a concomitant stimulation of en - docytosis , possibly by noncoated vesicles ( 3 , 5 , 8 , 14 , 15 , 32 , 33 , 41 , 42 , 58 ) . Membrane ruffling involves the cytoskeleton ( 32 , 33 , 41 , 42 ) and it is known from several studies that cytoskeletal inhibitors can reduce endocytosis ( 10 , 41 - - 43 , 57 ) . Recently we found that cytochalasin D reduces endocy - tosis of ricin and of the fluid phase marker sucrose without reducing the uptake of transferrin . Moreover , colchicine had a similar effect ( 46 ) . In contrast to these cytoskeletal inhibi - tors , EGF and TPA stimulated clathrin - independent endocy - tosis ( 46 ) . The noncoated endocytic vesicles analyzed in the present study could thus be formed by constitutive changes in plasma membrane geometry , a kind of ruffling , somehow involving cytoskeletal elements . A detailed study of the effect of EGF and TPA on membrane ruffling and endocyto - sis using an approach similar to the one reported here might throw more light on these problems . The identification of two distinct preendosomal vesicle populations raises some important questions in relation to en - docytic pathways . Thus , it is unknown whether molecules in - ternalized by the clathrin - independent mechanism described here reach the same endosomal compartment as do mole - cules such as the transferrin receptor and are subsequently sorted and further transported in the same way , i . e . , recycled back to the cell surface , transcytosed , delivered to the trans - Golgi network , or directed through a mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor - enriched prelysosomal compartment to lysosomes ( 55 ) . Studies by Tran et al . ( 51 ) using a2macroglobulin - gold as a marker for coated pit endocytosis and cholera toxin - gold as a marker for smooth pits at the cell surface suggest that molecules taken up by the two mechanisms in - deed meet in the same endosomal compartment . Even though the present findings as well as many previous studies on cultured cells ( 36 , 46 , 47 , 51 ) suggest that clathrin - independent endocytosis is a ubiquitous process , future stud - ies will have to determine what the significance of this endo - cytic mechanism is in various differentiated tissues in the organism .
