ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T Abstract : The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a well - studied receptor - tyrosine kinase that serves vital roles in regulation of organ development and cancer progression . EGFR not only exists on the plasma membrane , but also widely expressed in the nucleus , endosomes , and mitochondria . Most recently , several lines of evidences indicated that autophagy is regulated by EGFR in kinase - active and - independent manners . In this review , we summarized recent advances in our understanding of the functions of different subcellularly located EGFR on autophagy . Specifically , plasma membrane - and cytoplasm - located EGFR ( pcEGFR ) acts as a tyrosine kinase to regulate autophagy via the PI3K / AKT1 / mTOR , RAS / MAPK1 / 3 , and STAT3 signaling pathways . The kinase - independent function of pcEGFR inhibits autophagy by maintaining SLC5A1 - regulated intracellular glucose level . Endosome - located EGFR phosphorylates and inhibits Beclin1 to suppress autophagy , while kinase - independent endosome - located EGFR releases Beclin1 from the Rubicon - Beclin1 complex to increase autophagy . Additionally , the nuclear EGFR activates PRKDC / PNPase / MYC signaling to inhibit autophagy . Although the role of mitochondria - located EGFR in autophagy is largely unexplored , the production of ATP and reactive oxygen species mediated by mitochondrial dynamics is most likely to influence autophagy .

Introduction Autophagy is a cellular catabolic process in which nonessential intracellular components are engulfed and degraded by lysosomes in a precisely choreographed series of steps . A myriad of stimuli , such as hypoxia , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) , nutrient deprivation , DNA damage , damaged organelles , and intracellular microorganisms , are well established factors that can evoke autophagy to eliminate harmful stimuli and maintain energy homeostasis [ 1 , 2 ] . Based on the manner of cargo delivery to lysosomes , autophagy is classified into three subtypes : macroautophagy , microautophagy and chaperone - mediated autophagy [ 3 ] . Macroautophagy , hereafter referred to as autophagy , has been most extensively investigated in the past decade and will be discussed in this review . ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T The events of autophagosome biosynthesis can be roughly classified as vesicle nucleation , vesicle elongation , and autophagosome maturation [ 1 ] . During vesicle nucleation , a double membrane budding from endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) to form a cup - shaped phagophore . Subsequently , the phagophore undergoes elongation and transform into double membrane - bound autophagosome to envelop cytosol or organelles . The autophagosome then successively fuse with endosome and lysosome for maturation . Great strides have been made in elucidating the molecular underpinnings of the regulation of autophagy ( Figure 1 ) . Among them , the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) / AKT1 / mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling plays a major role in the negative regulation of autophagy [ 4 - 7 ] . MTOR is a component of mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 , a complex containing mTOR , Raptor , mLST8 / GßL , Deptor and PRAS40 ) and acts as a serine / threonine protein kinase to phosphorylate and inactivate unc - 51 like autophagy activating kinase ( ULK ) 1 / 2 [ 2 ] . Under the condition of starvation [ 8 ] or growth factor receptor inhibition [ 7 ] , the suppressed PI3K / AKT1 signaling increased the inhibitory activity of tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) 1 / 2 on Rheb , which is a small GTPase required for mTOR activity . The reduced mTOR activity subsequently dissociates mTORC1 from ULK1 / 2 complex ( A complex including ULK1 / 2 , ATG13 , ATG101 , and FIP200 ) and thus activates ULK1 / 2 . The activated ULK1 / 2 further phosphorylates two components of ULK1 / 2 complex , ATG13 and FIP200 , and then initiates autophagy cascade . Besides , AMP - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) signaling pathway is also implicated in the mTOR - regulated autophagy [ 9 ] . AMPK can be activated by low ATP / AMP ratio and stimulates autophagy via either activating TSC1 / 2 or inhibiting mTOR activity . Apart ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T from the mTOR - dependent signaling pathway , recent studies also indicated several mTOR - independent pathways . Hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha subunit ( HIF1A ) is a transcription factor induced by hypoxic stimuli , and increases its downstream target Adenovirus E1B - binding protein Nip3 ( BNIP3 ) to compete the B - cell lymphoma 2 ( BCL2 ) from Beclin1 - BCL2 complex [ 10 ] . As BCL2 is a negative regulator of Beclin1 , the released Beclin1 tethers its binding partners phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase catalytic subunit type 3 ( VPS34 ) , and serine / threonine kinase VPS15 on autophagosome membrane , forming a Beclin1 - VPS34 - VPS15 core complex to elongate the vesicles [ 1 ] . Some other signaling axes also regulate autophagy via Beclin1 , such as starvation - induced RAS / mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) 1 / 3 signaling [ 10 ] , and ER stress - stimulated inositol - requiring enzyme 1 ( IRE1 ) / c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) signaling [ 11 , 12 ] . Moreover , ER stress also activates protein kinase R - like endoplasmic reticulum kinase ( PERK ) , which is a kinase of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A ( EIF2A ) [ 13 ] . The phosphorylated EIF2A upregulates the expression of ATG12 , and promotes the process of vesicle elongation [ 14 ] . During this stage , the E1 - like enzyme ATG7 and E2 - like enzyme ATG10 facilitate the conjugation of ATG5 to ATG12 , which further recruits ATG16 to form a Atg12 - Atg5 - Atg16 complex [ 1 ] . The Atg12 - Atg5 - Atg16 complex then form a tetramer to lipide phosphatidylethanolamine microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha ( MAP1LC3A ) , which subsequently insert in autophagosome membrane to elongate phagophores . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , a member of the human ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinase , is ubiquitously expressed in epithelial , mesenchymal and neuronal cells . After ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T its discovery in the early 1980s [ 15 ] , EGFR has attracted more and more attention in tumorigenesis , metastasis and drug resistance . Overexpression or activating mutations of EGFR increases cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis , leading to a poor prognosis in solid tumors [ 16 ] . EGFR signaling also has been discovered to exhibit important roles in the field of organ development , such as mammary gland [ 17 , 18 ] , hippocampus [ 19 ] , and epiphyseal cartilage development [ 20 ] . Current research has indicated that EGFR not only exists on the plasma membrane , but also widely expressed in the nucleus and in other organelles , such as endosomes , lysosomes and mitochondria [ 21 ] . It is widely accepted that this phenomenon is mainly due to EGFR trafficking . Upon ligand stimulation , EGFR undergoes phosphorylation and dimerization , which expedites the EGFR dimer internalization through clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) [ 22 - 24 ] . Moreover , some ligands such as heparin binding EGF like growth factor ( HBEGF ) and betacellulin can also induce EGFR endocytosis in a clathrin - independent manner [ 25 ] . These procedures do not require EGFR kinase activity or auto - phosphorylation , but the di - leucine 1010 LL 1011 motif and the internalization motif including C - terminal sequences 1005 – 1017 of EGFR are essential for EGFR internalization [ 26 ] . Internalized EGFR is primarily located in the endosomes and are subsequently recycled to the cell surface as well as other organelles or undergo proteolytic degradation in lysosomes , an activity that depends on the concentration and the attributes of the ligand [ 27 , 28 ] . Interestingly , the various subcellularly localized EGFRs are able to modulate autophagy both in a kinase - active and kinase - independent manner . In this review , we will summarize the current knowledge of the function of EGFR in autophagy . ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T 2 . Structure and functional domains of EGFR EGFR is a 170 kDa ( 1186 amino acids ) transmembrane receptor that consists of three functional domains : an extracellular domain ( ECD ) , a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain ( ICD ) [ 29 - 32 ] . The ECD is a ligand - interacting structure that has two ligand binding domains ( L1 and L2 ) and two cysteine - rich domains ( CR1 and CR2 ) . The transmembrane domain is an α - helix anchor sequence that allows the receptor to traverse the cell membrane . The ICD is subdivided into two parts : a conserved catalytic tyrosine kinase domain and a regulatory domain containing multiple tyrosine residues ( Figure 2 ) . Once bound to a ligand , the two receptors dimerize , which then allows the tyrosine kinase domain of one receptor to phosphorylate the other receptor [ 29 ] . The phosphorylated tyrosine residues further recruit and activate downstream signaling effectors , such as AKT1 , signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) and RAS . Studies to date indicate that a unique subset of tyrosine residues in the regulatory domain ( Figure 2 ) have their own effect . Among these , the phosphorylation of tyrosine ( Y ) residues 1068 , Y1086 , Y1101 and Y1148 are responsible for attracting growth factor receptor bound protein 2 ( GRB2 ) [ 29 , 33 ] and STAT3 [ 33 , 34 ] . And the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the tyrosine kinase domain also exerts a vital role in EGFR signaling . For example , the phosphorylation of Y703 is responsible for interacting with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 ( STAT1 ) [ 33 ] . The residue 845 is essential for binding of SRC [ 33 ] . And the Y974 has been shown to induce EGFR internalization [ 29 ] . However , further exploration is needed to establish whether any specific amino acid residue or motif is required for post - endocytic EGFR sorting . ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T 3 . Regulation of autophagy by plasma membrane and cytoplasmic EGFR ( pcEGFR ) signaling 3 . 1 Kinase - active functions EGFR is primary located on the cell surface and is activated by the binding of its ligands , such as epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , transforming growth factor alpha ( TGFA ) and HBEGF [ 35 ] . Upon activation , EGFR undergoes dimerization and endocytosis , during which EGFR upregulates AKT1 , STAT3 and RAS signaling pathways to promote DNA synthesis and cell proliferation [ 36 ] . Constitutive activation or overexpression of EGFR has already been known to promote carcinogenesis as well as tumor development and progression [ 37 - 39 ] ; hence , a growing number of EGFR - targeted agents have been developed to dampen excessive EGFR activity [ 16 , 40 ] . EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) and EGFR neutralizing antibodies have been reported to precipitate autophagy induction in non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and breast cancer cells [ 7 , 41 ] . The kinase activity of EGFR exhibits quite a dichotomous role in the regulation of autophagy through the following pathways ( Figure 3 . left panel ) . ( 1 ) , EGFR / PI3K / AKT1 / mTOR signaling . After ligand stimulation , activated EGFR binds GRB2 and GRB2 - associated binding protein 1 ( GAB1 ) to recruit PI3K . PI3K then catalyzes AKT1 phosphorylation and subsequently activates mTOR , which negatively regulates autophagy induction [ 4 , 6 , 7 ] . Treatment A431 vulvar squamous carcinoma cells with cetuximab , a EGFR neutralizing antibody , observed an increased convention of MAP1LC3A in accompanied with a decreased phosphorylation of MAPK1 , AKT1 , and MTOR . The autophagic flux was suppressed in the ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T myristoylated AKT1 ( a constitutively phosphorylated modification of AKT1 ) - transfected A431 cells , but not in the constitutive active mutation of mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase 1a ( MAP2K1 ) - transfected A431 cells . Therefor , we can infer that EGFR inhibition suppressed PI3K / AKT1 / mTOR axis to induce autophagy [ 6 ] . Consistently , other EGFR - TKIs and neutralizing antibody treatments also resulted in autophagy induction in multiple cancers , including glioblastoma , human vulvar squamous carcinoma , colorectal adenocarcinoma , and NSCLC cells [ 6 , 7 ] . ( 2 ) , EGFR / RAS / MAPK1 / 3 signaling . After auto - phosphorylation , EGFR binds GRB2 to activate SOS , a GTP - exchange factor that converts RAS - GDP into active RAS - GTP and subsequently actives MAPK1 / 3 . It is plausible that activated RAS ( HRASV12 ) upregulates phorbol - 12 - myristate - 13 - acetate - induced protein 1 ( PMAIP1 ) to competitively bind myeloid cell leukemia 1 ( MCL1 ) , which is a negative binding partner of Beclin1 [ 42 ] . As a consequence , the increased Beclin1 protein level promotes autophagy to occur . ( 3 ) , EGFR / JAK2 / STAT3 signaling . Once activated by stimuli , EGFR activates Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) to phosphorylate STAT3 on residue Tyr705 [ 43 , 44 ] . STAT3 has been implicated in multiple aspects of the autophagic process . We recently summarized the roles of different subcellular localization patterns of STAT3 in autophagy [ 45 ] . The nuclear STAT3 ( nSTAT3 ) inhibits autophagy through increasing the expression of several negative regulators of autophagy ( such as BCL2 , BCL2 like 1 ( BCL2L1 ) , MCL1 ) or downregulating essential autophagy - related ( ATG ) genes ( such as Beclin1 and VPS34 ) ; While cytoplasmic STAT3 ( cytoSTAT3 ) inhibits autophagy by sequestering eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 2 ( EIF2AK2 ) , forkhead box protein O1 ( FOXO1 ) , and forkhead box protein O3 ( FOXO3 ) [ 35 ] ; and the mitochondrial STAT3 ( mitoSTAT3 ) inhibits autophagy via dampening ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ROS production [ 45 , 46 ] . 3 . 2 Kinase - independent functions An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated a kinase - independent activity of EGFR . As first reported by Miettinen PJ et al . [ 47 ] , EGFR - / - mice had abnormalities in the epidermis , hair follicles , and intestines and exhibited lung dysplasia , growth retardation and a short life - span . By contrast , kinase - dead EGFR only derived phenotypes with skin and eye abnormalities [ 48 ] . In this context , it is reasonable to conclude that EGFR sustains its vital role in biologic events far beyond its kinase activity . However , little is known about the kinase - independent functions of pcEGFR , especially in autophagy . Weihua and coworkers [ 49 ] found that , knocking down of EGFR caused autophagic cell death in multiple cancer cell lines , whereas treated with EGFR - TKIs ( AEE788 and AG1478 ) only resulted in suppression of proliferation in PC - 3MM2 cells , hinting at the possibility of a kinae - independent role of EGFR in autophagy . Since energy shortage is a verified cause of autophagy , Weihua et al . interrogated energy supply in the EGFR knockdown cells and detected a significant decrease of intracellular glucose level . The authors then measured the glucose transporter system in PC - 3MM2 cells and discovered a remarkable reduced expression of solute carrier family 5 member 1 ( SLC5A1 ) . SLC5A1 is a sodium / glucose cotransporter , which can be stabilized by binding to the ECD of EGFR . Upon EGFR knockdown , SLC5A1 mechanically dissociated from the ECD of EGFR and undergone degradation , leading to decreased intracellular basal glucose levels and subsequently activated autophagy ( Figure 3 . right panel ) . ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T 4 . Regulation of autophagy by endosome - located EGFR ( endoEGFR ) signaling 4 . 1 Kinase - active functions Evidence so far indicates that the endocytic trafficking of EGFR is an important mechanism that limits the duration of EGFR signaling [ 50 , 51 ] . Unfortunately , the biological events of endoEGFR signaling remain largely unexplored . As mentioned above , the pcEGFR actives Beclin1 indirectly via RAS / MAPK1 / 3 signaling , however , Wei and coworkers reported a direct interaction between endoEGFR and Beclin1 [ 52 ] . Challenging A549 cells with EGF induced a physical interaction between EGFR and Beclin1 in endosomes , and this phenomenon was also observed without EGF stimulation in the EGFRΔ746 - 750 ( an activating mutant EGFR ) - transfected Hela cells . While the EGFR - TKI erlotinib abolished the interaction between EGFR and Beclin1 , indicating the requirement of EGFR kinase activity in the formation of EGFR - Beclin1 complex . Further investigation identified that , the activated endoEGFR tethered Beclin1 at C - terminal residues 244 - 377 ( also named the ECD domain ) , and phosphorylated three tyrosine residues in Beclin1 ( Y229 , Y233 and Y352 ) , which further increased both the Beclin1 - RUN and cysteine rich domain containing beclin 1 interacting protein ( Rubicon ) and Beclin1 - BCL2 complexes and subsequently dampened excessive autophagy ( Figure 3 . left panel ) . However , the phosphorylation state of Beclin1 in the BCL2 - Beclin1 complex has not been determined ( as indicated by question mark ) . Pharmacological intervention with EGFR - TKI disrupted the Beclin1 - Rubicon and Beclin1 - EGFR complexes , resulting in the release of Beclin1 into cytoplasm to evoke autophagy [ 52 ] . ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T 4 . 2 Kinase - independent functions A recent study demonstrated that EGFR signaling could be enhanced and prolonged by lysosomal protein transmembrane 4 beta ( LAPTM4B ) through inhibition of EGF - induced EGFR intraluminal sorting and proteolytic degradation [ 53 ] . Xiaojun Tan et al . [ 54 ] discovered that inactive EGFR was localized on the exocyst complex component 2 ( EXOC2 ) and LAPTM4B dual - positive endosomes . Accumulation of endoEGFR was accompanied with an increased MAP1LC3A turnover and MAP1LC3A puncta formation in either basal or serum - starved cells . However , these phenomena were not detected in the EGFR knockdown cells , but were recovered after re - expression of either siRNA - resistant widetype or K721A kinase - dead EGFR . In addition , the autophagy mediated by re - expression of wide - type EGFR was enhanced by gefitinib , indicating a kinase - independent role of endoEGFR in autophagy . Further investigations revealed that inactive endoEGFR dissociated Rubicon from Beclin1 and thereafter released Beclin1 to evoke autophagy ( Figure 3 . right panel ) . In contrast to starvation - induced autophagy , LAPTM4B does not seem to be entangled in EGFR - TKI - induced autophagy , as confirmed by the coIP of EGFR ( Figure 3 . right panel ) . 5 . Regulation of autophagy by nuclear EGFR ( nEGFR ) signaling The nuclear portion of EGFR is mainly a result of EGFR internalization and trafficking to the nucleoplasm and inner nuclear membrane [ 55 - 57 ] . After activation , the internalized EGFR tethers to importin β1 ( KPNB1 ) via its nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) [ 58 ] and subsequently entangles nucleoporins in the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) to facilitate translocation of EGFR to the nuclear membrane and nucleoplasm [ 59 ] . In accordance with the ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T importance of EGFR for cell proliferation and survival , nEGFR exhibits biological effect that highly exceeds the conventional RTK moiety . On the one hand , nEGFR activates DNA - dependent protein kinase ( protein kinase , DNA - activated , catalytic polypeptide , PRKDC ) to recast the radiation - induced DNA double strand breaks ( Dsbs ) [ 60 , 61 ] . On the other hand , nEGFR coalesces with other transcription factors such as STAT3 [ 62 ] to regulate the expression of many critical genes , including CCND1 , MYC , prostaglandin - endoperoxide synthase 2 ( PTGS2 ) , HIF1A , TWIST1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( NOS2 ) [ 34 , 56 , 62 - 65 ] . PRKDC is a serine - threonine protein kinase that repairs DNA - Dsbs primarily through a non - homologous end - joining mechanism [ 66 ] . In the presence of radiation or EGFR neutralizing antibodies treatment [ 66 , 67 ] , nEGFR interacts with PRKDC and offers an alternative pathway to repair Dsbs . The nEGFR - PRKDC complex decreased after treating cancer cells with AG1478 ( an EGFR - TKI ) , indicating that the kinase activity of nEGFR was required for their interaction [ 68 ] . The nEGFR - PRKDC complex further recruits and phosphorylates the Ser - 776 residue of polynucleotide phosphorylase ( PNPase ) in the nucleoplasm [ 68 ] . Phosphorylated PNPase reduces MYC mRNA degradation and enhances cellular radioresistance ( Figure 3 . left panel ) . Silencing of PRKDC by siRNA reduced the Thr 389 phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 ( RPS6KB1 ) which resulted in massive autophagic cell death in ionizing radiation ( IR ) - treated glioma cells [ 69 , 70 ] . As RPS6KB1 is a substrate of mTOR [ 70 ] , it is reasonable to infer that mTOR / RPS6KB1 signaling might also be involved in the PRKDC - regulated autophagy . ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T 6 . Regulation of autophagy by mitochondria - located EGFR ( mitoEGFR ) signaling MitoEGFR was first discovered by Sarah Parsons and colleagues in 2004 [ 71 ] . Other studies have since demonstrated that mitoEGFR can regulate multiple cellular events , such as mitochondrial dynamics , cellular ATP production , cell motility and invasiveness , drug resistance and apoptosis [ 72 - 74 ] . Autophagy was reported to be extensively involved in these cellular events . Thus , we propose that mitoEGFR might have a regulatory role in autophagy . 6 . 1 Kinase - active functions Upon EGF stimulation , EGFR undergoes phosphorylation and translocates to the mitochondria together with SRC [ 71 ] . Transfecting fibroblasts with K721A - EGFR ( a kinase inactive mutant of the EGFR ) decreased the mitochondria - located K721A - EGFR , indicating that the EGFR kinase activity is required for the trafficking of EGFR to mitochondria . Mitochondria localized SRC subsequently phosphorylates the tyrosine 845 of the EGFR and allows p - Y845 - mitoEGFR to associate and phosphorylate mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase II ( MT - CO2 ) [ 71 ] . The phosphorylated MT - CO2 then inhibits the function of mitochondria , as evidenced by the decrease in cellular ATP and free radical production [ 72 ] . Both ATP and ROS are well - known autophagy regulators : 1 ) . AMPK signaling can be activated in response to a high intracellular AMP / ATP ratio and subsequently trigger autophagy [ 75 ] . 2 ) . ROS directly oxidates the Cys81 residue of ATG4 and protects MAP1LC3A from delipidation , allowing autophagy to occur [ 76 ] . 3 ) . ROS can also induce autophagy indirectly through stabilizing HIF1A [ 77 , 78 ] . ( Figure 3 . left panel . ) ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T 6 . 2 Kinase - independent functions A recent report elucidated a kinase - independent role of mitoEGFR in regulating cellular ATP genesis . Under EGF stimulation , mitoEGFR increased mitochondrial fission , ATP production , and cellular motility by disturbing mitofusin - 1 ( MFN1 ) polymerization [ 74 ] . Che TF et al . [ 74 ] transfected CL1 - 0 cells with a constitutive activating mutant L858R , a kinase dead mutant K745A and wild type EGFR . As a result , all the mitoEGFR mutants had the same effect in mitochondrial fission and cellular motility , indicating that the interaction between mitoEGFR and MFN1 is EGFR kinase - independent [ 74 ] . Interestingly , other reports also suggested that mitoEGFR plays an important role in regulating mitochondrial fusion . Bollu LR et al . [ 73 ] identified a mitoEGFR - prohibitin 2 ( PHB2 ) interaction by immunoprecipitation , and the interaction was also independent of EGFR kinase activity . As PHB2 protected optic atrophy 1 ( OPA1 ) from proteolysis [ 79 ] , the increased mitoEGFR - PHB2 complex stabilized OPA1 and promoted mitochondrial fusion . Given that mitochondria is the main source of ATP and ROS [ 80 ] , the interconversion of mitochondria between fission and fusion may have a severe impact on ATP and ROS production , which further regulates autophagy in the signaling circuitry mentioned above . ( Figure 3 . right panel . ) BCL2 binding component 3 ( PUMA ) is a well - known pro - apoptotic member in the BCL2 family that triggers apoptosis via unfolding of BCL2L1 and the release of tumor protein p53 ( TP53 ) [ 81 ] . Under certain apoptotic stress , such as staurosporine or anisomycin - treatment , PUMA translocates to mitochondria , where it tethers to EGFR before being released into the ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T cytoplasm [ 82 , 83 ] . This PUMA - EGFR interaction is considered to be EGFR kinase independent because gefitinib had no effect on the formation of the EGFR - PUMA complex [ 82 , 83 ] . Zhang et al . [ 84 ] identified that PUMA regulated autophagy through calcium / MAPK1 / 3 signaling in primary retinal microglia , aortic artery smooth muscle cells , and brain endothelial cells [ 84 ] . ( Figure 3 . right panel ) Therefore , we speculate that PUMA is likely implicated in the mitoEGFR - regulated autophagy , although more efforts would be required to understand the interplay between these signaling pathways . 7 . Conclusions and Perspectives Autophagy is extraordinary important cellular event that ubiquitously involved in organ development and the pathogenesis of many diseases . Decreased autophagy is associated with reduced cavitation , neural tube defects , early onset neurodegeneration , and embryonic lethality [ 85 , 86 ] . EGFR signaling also has an important role in embryo formation , organ development and tumorigenesis [ 16 , 48 , 87 ] . However , the relationship between EGFR signaling and autophagy remains to be elucidated . In this review , we analyzed the critical roles of various subcellularly located EGFRs in autophagy , either in kinase - active or kinase - independent ways . Although no literature to date attempt to identify the relation between EGFR signaling and autophagy during tumorigenesis , autophagy acts as a brake mechanism in this phase by mean of eliminating damage materials , such as genome damage , accumulating of ROS and p62 / SQSTM1 [ 88 , 89 ] . Haploinsufficiency of Beclin1 in immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cells ( iMMECs ) generated a phenotype of altered glandular morphology and ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T accelerated growth , which was regarded as a promotion of tumorigenesis [ 88 ] . From this perspective , autophagy may have an antagonistic effect on EGFR - induced tumorigenesis . When it comes to the scenario of tumor progression , inhibiting the kinase activity of EGFR primarily features pro - autophagic characteristics via PI3K / AKT1 / mTOR signaling , as we previously reported [ 7 ] . EGFR - TKIs treatment induced a primary effect of apoptotic cell death , however , they also stimulated autophagy to allow NSCLC cells survival . Inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine significantly sensitized tumor cells to anti - EGFR treatment , indicating a cytoprotective function of autophagy . This point of view is also supported by other TKIs and neutralizing antibodies in multiple cancer cell lines [ 5 , 6 ] . However , other researchers have reported a cytocidal effect of autophagy . Fan et al . [ 6 ] reported that the apoptosis - induced cytoprotective autophagy was further supplanted by autophagic cell death [ 90 ] . In other cases , challenging glioblastoma cells with MK - 2206 , an AKT1 inhibitor , induced both autophagy and apoptosis , while autophagy switched to autosis in the late stage of the treatment [ 91 ] . Although the subtle relationship between autophagy and cell survival has not been fully understood , one of the possible explanations is that autophagy can be a protector or a predator depending on the extent or duration . The effect of EGFR on autophagy depends on its subcellular location and kinase activity . Regarding its kinase activity , the primary effect of pcEGFR tends to inhibit autophagy via EGFR / AKT1 / mTOR signaling axis . The endoEGFR also inhibits autophagy by phosphorylating and inactivating Beclin1 [ 52 ] . Regarding the kinase - independent activity , pcEGFR inhibits autophagic cell death under starvation conditions [ 49 ] . However , the ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T kinase - independent endoEGFR stimulates autophagy under conditions of basal , starvation , and EGFR - TKIs treatment . Although the mechanism involved in nEGFR and mitoEGFR - regulated autophagy is still elusive , the downstream signalings of nEGFR and mitoEGFR hold crosstalks with autophagy ( The literatures are summarized in supplemental table 1 & 2 ) . Thus , future mechanistic studies featuring the role of EGFR in autophagy should be investigated separately based on the spatial localization and the requirement for kinase activity .
