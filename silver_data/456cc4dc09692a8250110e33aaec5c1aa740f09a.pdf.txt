The principle coat components , clathrin and the AP - 2 adaptor complex , assemble a polyhedral lattice at plasma membrane bud sites with the aid of several endocytic accessory proteins . Here , we show that huntingtin - interacting protein 1 ( HIP1 ) , a binding partner of huntingtin , co - purifies with brain clathrin - coated vesicles and associates directly with both AP - 2 and clathrin . The discrete interaction sequences within HIP1 that facilitate binding are analogous to motifs present in other accessory proteins , including AP180 , amphiphysin and epsin . Bound to a phosphoinositide - containing membrane surface via an ENTH domain , HIP1 associates with AP - 2 to provide coincident clathrin - binding sites that together efficiently recruit clathrin to the bilayer . Our data implicate HIP1 in endocytosis and the similar modular architecture and function of HIP1 , epsin and AP180 suggest a common role in lipid - regulated clathrin lattice biogenesis . by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 4 Endocytosis entails the preferential recruitment of select molecules into a patch of plasma membrane that will bud into the cytoplasm . At the bud site , an assembling clathrin coat links the mechanical process of invagination to cargo selection . The core endocytic components , clathrin trimers and the AP - 2 heterotetramer , as well as lipids ( 1 ) and multiple protein cofactors , collectively termed endocytic accessory proteins ( 2 ) , participate in bud nucleation , lattice assembly and invagination , and in the final scission event ( 1 - 3 ) . The precise role of many of the accessory proteins remains poorly understood however . One common feature of several of the accessory proteins is the capacity to bind to both AP - 2 and clathrin ( 4 - 13 ) . Associations with the AP - 2 adaptor complex generally involve the independently folded appendage domains of the large α ( α A or α C isoform ) and β 2 subunits , each separated from the heterotetrameric adaptor core by a flexible hinge . Despite only ~ 10 % sequence identity , the fold of the β 2 appendage ( 14 ) is structurally analogous to that of the α appendage ( 15 , 16 ) , and , indeed , the α C and β 2 appendages interact with an overlapping group of partner proteins ( 14 ) . The privileged association of accessory factors with the core endocytic machinery is due to discrete interaction sequences located within each accessory protein . In epsin and eps15 , the AP - 2 α C - binding sequence is Asp - Pro - Trp ( DPW ) and Asp - Pro - Phe ( DPF ) respectively , each protein bearing multiple triplets arrayed in a tandem fashion . The minimal region of amphiphysin I ( 12 ) or AP180 ( 8 ) required to bind the α C appendage does not contain a DPF / W sequence however . Instead , in these proteins , and the long - splice isoform of phosphoinositide by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 5 polyphosphatase synaptojanin , SJ170 , an alternate binding motif is based upon the di - aromatic consensus sequence FXDXF ( where X is any amino acid ) 1 . Several of the designated AP - 2 – binding accessory proteins also interact directly with clathrin . The most prevalent binding motif that facilitates clathrin association is based upon the consensus L [ L , I ] [ D , E , N ] [ L , F ] [ D , E ] ( 6 , 17 , 18 ) , the so - called clathrin box ( 19 ) . Variations on this type I consensus are found adjacent to the AP - 2 binding sequences in amphiphysin ( 6 , 12 ) , epsin ( 7 , 9 , 10 ) , AP180 ( 13 , 20 ) and β - arrestin ( 21 ) . The extended type I clathrin - binding sequence interacts with an elongated shallow cleft in the globular amino - terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain ( 19 ) . Here , we identify an additional protein , huntingtin - interacting protein 1 ( HIP1 ) , which displays canonical AP - 2 - and clathrin - binding motifs as well as overall domain organization and functional properties akin to epsin , AP180 and amphiphysin . Our data strongly implicate HIP1 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 6 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Construct preparation —Glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - HIP1M1 ( residues 311 – 394 ) and M2 ( residues 311 – 369 ) were prepared using appropriate PCR primers and human EST xd79f07 . x1 ( Research Genetics ) as the template . The inserts were ligated , after digestion , into Eco RI / Xho I - cleaved pGEX - 4T - 1 . A similar PCR - based strategy was used to insert the human HIP1M1 segment into pcDNA3 . 1 with an amino - terminal myc - epitope tag . The GST - mHIP1 ( 1 - 533 ) fusion construct was prepared to contain in - frame insertion of nucleotide 1 – 1599 of mouse HIP1 . GST - SJ170C2 ( residues 1454 – 1530 ) and GST - epsin 1 ( 1 – 407 ) were prepared similarly using human EST nf51b08 . s1 ( Incyte Genomics ) and rat epsin 1 cDNA , kindly provided by Pietro De Camilli , respectively . Mutations were generated using appropriate mutagenic primers with the QuikChange kit ( Stratagene ) as described elsewhere ( 10 , 16 ) . All constructs and mutations were confirmed by automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing . Cytosol and Protein purification —Cytosol was prepared from frozen rat brains exactly as described previously ( 22 ) . The rat brain detergent extract was prepared as described elsewhere ( 12 ) and filtered into assay buffer ( 25 mM Hepes - KOH , pH 7 . 2 , 125 mM potassium acetate , 5 mM magnesium acetate , 2 mM EDTA , 2 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT ) containing 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 before use . GST - fusion proteins were produced in E . coli using a standard IPTG induction protocol ( 10 , 16 ) . After lysis in B - PER ( Pierce ) , soluble protein was purified on glutathione ( GSH ) Sepharose , eluted with 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 10 mM GSH , 5 mM DTT and then dialyzed into PBS , 1 mM DTT . Human HIP1M1 ( residues 311 - 369 ) , by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 7 HIP1M2 ( residues 311 – 369 ) and epsin DPW ( residues 249 - 407 ) were cleaved from GST with thrombin , followed by addition of the irreversible thrombin inhibitor PPACK ( Calbiochem ) to a final concentration of 25 µ M . For the GST - mHIP1 ( 1 - 533 ) , the purified recombinant protein was first dialyzed to remove GSH and then treated with thrombin to cleave off the HIP1 segment . Liberated GST was removed by adding a second aliquot of GSH - Sepharose and collecting the unbound fraction as mHIP1 ( 1 - 533 ) . Clathrin and AP - 2 were purified from rat brain clathrin - coated vesicles by Tris extraction followed by sequential chromatography over Superose 6 and hydroxylapatite ( 23 ) . Pooled clathrin - or AP - 2 - containing fractions were gel - filtered into assay buffer and centrifuged at 134 , 000 X g max before use in binding assays . Binding assays —For pull - down - type assays , GST or GST - fusion proteins were first immobilized on GSH Sepharose , washed in assay buffer and then mixed with clarified rat brain cytosol / detergent extract to give a final concentration of ~ 7 . 5 mg / ml in 300 µ l total volume ( 10 , 24 ) . After incubation at 4°C for 60 min , the beads were separated by centrifugation and aliquots corresponding to 1 / 80 of each supernatant and 1 / 8 of each washed pellet were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting exactly as described ( 10 , 16 , 24 ) . The two - stage liposome binding assays used synthetic liposomes composed of 10 % ( w / w ) cholesterol , 30 % ( w / w ) phosphatidylethanolamine , 30 % ( w / w ) phosphatidylcholine and 30 % ( w / w ) phosphoinositides ( Sigma ) prepared as described elsewhere ( 25 ) . Aliquots of 10 µ g of mHIP1 ( 1 - 533 ) , GST - epsin ( 1 - 407 ) , by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 8 AP - 2 , or combinations thereof , were first preincubated with 0 . 5 mg / ml liposomes for 60 min at 4°C . After centrifugation at 20 , 000 X g max for 15 min , the lipid pellets were resuspended in assay buffer , then 5 µ g clathrin added and the volume adjusted to 200 µ l . Both stages contained 0 . 1 mg / ml BSA as a protein carrier . After a further 60 min incubation at 4°C , the liposomes were again centrifuged and the pellets resuspended in SDS - sample buffer . Aliquots corresponding to 1 / 25 of each supernatant and 1 / 4 of each pellet were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Transient transfections —COS - 7 cells were grown at 37°C in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and 2 mM L - glutamine . Cells plated on poly - L - lysine - coated round glass coverslips were transfected with DEAE dextran and , after 48 hours , incubated in serum - free DMEM for 60 min . Biotinylated human transferrin ( 25 µ g / ml ) was then added and incubation continued for 15 min at 37°C . Cells were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described ( 10 ) . Antibodies —Polyclonal antibodies directed against HIP1 were generated by immunizing rabbits with the GST - HIP1M1 fusion protein . Anti - HIP1 antibodies were affinity purified on thrombin - cleaved HIP1M1 coupled to CNBr - activated Sepharose 4B using standard procedures . The sources of the antibodies against clathrin , the AP - 2 subunits , epsin , amphiphysin , AP180 and eps15 have been described ( 10 , 16 , 24 ) . Anti - myc mAb 9E10 was from BAbCo and the anti - synaptotagmin I mAb was purchased from Transduction Laboratories . by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 9 RESULTS Searching the databases for additional proteins that contain the AP - 2 binding FXDXF motif we identified HIP1 . This protein was initially discovered in screens for binding partners of huntingtin ( 26 , 27 ) , the product of the gene that undergoes pathogenic CAG - codon expansion in Huntington’s disease . HIP1 displays a modular domain architecture : an epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain precedes a central region predicted to have a high propensity for coiled - coil formation , followed by a C - terminal talin - homology I / LWEQ domain ( Fig . 1A ) . Within the central region of the protein , before the coiled - coil segment , a stretch of three interwoven FX [ N / D / S ] X [ F / L ] motifs proceeds a single DPF triplet ( Fig . 1B ) . Significantly , this region of HIP1 is quite divergent from HIP1R ( Fig . 1B ) , a related protein roughly 50 % identical to HIP1 that localizes to clathrin - coated pits ( 28 ) . The presence of these motifs within HIP1 is intriguing as the intracellular staining pattern of HIP1 is highly reminiscent of AP - 2 and clathrin ( 29 ) , and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HIP1 / HIP1R orthologue , Sla2p / End4p , is implicated in endocytic control ( 30 , 31 ) . In fact , we find that in rat brain extracts , HIP1 copurifies with clathrin - coated vesicles ( Fig . 2 , lane d ) . Affinity purified anti - HIP1 antibodies detect a major ~ 120 - kDa polypeptide with a distribution that , on subcellular fractionation , clearly parallels that of both clathrin and the AP - 2 adaptor complex ( Fig . 2 ) . Like HIP1 , a major fraction of AP180 is also recovered in the clathrin - coated vesicle fraction also containing the recycling synaptic vesicle transmembrane protein synaptotagmin I ( right panel , lane d ) ( 5 , 23 ) . By contrast , although present , other accessory proteins , including epsin 1 and amphiphysin are not correspondingly enriched within the purified coated by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 10 vesicle fraction ( lane c compared to lane d ) and substantial cytosolic pools of these proteins exist ( lane c ) ( 5 ) . These results show that HIP1 is significantly enriched in clathrin - coated endocytic vesicles found in brain . HIP1 associates directly with the AP - 2 adaptor —To assess whether the region harboring the FXDXF / DPF - type sequences does actually facilitate an interaction with AP - 2 , brain cytosol was incubated with GST - fusion proteins containing this region of human HIP1 . The HIP1M1 - and M2 - fusion proteins ( see Fig . 1A ) both pull down AP - 2 near quantitatively ( Fig . 3A , lane f and h ) , whereas GST alone fails to interact with the adaptor complex ( lane b ) , which remains in the supernatant ( lane a ) . The presence of the µ 2 adaptor subunit verifies that heterotetrameric AP - 2 adaptor complexes bind and , in these assays , the extent of AP - 2 association with the HIP1 fusions is similar to that seen with the GST - SJ170C2 fusion ( lane d ) , which contains residues 1454 - 1530 of human SJ170 harboring the sequence 1462 G F K D S F . Importantly , the soluble , native HIP1 protein also binds to the isolated α C - appendage domain of AP - 2 . When incubated with brain cytosol , GST - α C binds to AP180 , epsin , ( Fig . 3B , lane f ) , eps15 , and amphiphysin I and II ( see Fig . 3C ) ( 15 , 16 ) but , as there is very little HIP1 in cytosolic extracts ( Fig . 2 ) , only low level HIP1 association is observed ( Fig . 3B , right panel , lane f ) . HIP1 is more abundant in a rat brain detergent extract ( 12 ) ( Fig . 3B , lane c ) and , after incubation with this extract , a prominent additional ~ 120 - kDa band is recovered together with the common binding partners on the GST - α C beads ( Fig . 2B , left panel , lane h by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 11 compared to lane f ) . This major polypeptide is confirmed to be HIP1 by immunoblotting ( right panel , lane h ) . The substantially enhanced recovery of native HIP1 on the GST - α C beads without a concomitant increase in the other appendage partners again argues that the HIP1 – AP - 2 interaction is direct . To confirm that HIP1 engages the same binding surface on the α C appendage utilized by other endocytic accessory proteins , we tested the capacity of the AP - 2 - binding region of HIP1 to inhibit the association of other cytosolic accessory proteins with the immobilized GST - α C appendage . As a control , supplementing brain cytosol with 20 µ M epsin 1 DPW domain ( which contains eight tandemly arrayed DPW triplets ) completely abrogates amphiphysin and AP180 binding and only low level epsin and eps15 association remains ( Fig . 3C , lane f ) ( 15 ) . Since the added DPW domain abolishes associations when bound substoichiometrically to the α C appendage ( left panel , lane f ) , a single DPW domain is capable of engaging multiple appendages simultaneously . By contrast , addition of 20 µ M HIP1M2 affects neither epsin nor eps15 binding ( lane h ) . Instead , this concentration of the HIP1 fragment totally inhibits AP180 binding and partially interferes with the amphiphysin interaction ( lane h ) . Thus , the HIP1 fragment inhibits the α C partner associations in the reverse order of their apparent affinity for GST - α C ( epsin ≈ eps15 > amphiphysin > AP180 ) ( 16 ) ; the cooperative effect of the multiple DPF / W triplets in eps15 and epsin resists efficient HIP1 competition under these conditions 2 . by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 12 DPF and FXDXF sequences both bind directly to the α C appendage 1 . To gain some insight into the relative contribution of these two sequences within HIP1 to AP - 2 binding , the DPF triplet was altered to KPS using site - directed mutagenesis . This substitution severely compromises the ability of the GST - HIP1M2 fusion to associate with soluble AP - 2 ( Fig . 3A , lane i and j ) but clearly does not abolish adaptor binding totally . We conclude from these experiments that HIP1 binds to AP - 2 directly by engaging the common binding surface on the platform subdomain of the α C appendage and that the distal DPF sequence appears to be the dominant ligand . We attribute the remaining adaptor binding observed with the DPF mutant to the proximal FXDXF motif . Significantly , all of the known accessory proteins containing the FXDXF motif ( amphiphysin , AP180 , SJ170 , HIP1 ) have one or more DXF / W triplets located adjacent to this sequence . HIP1 also binds to clathrin trimers directly — In addition to binding to AP - 2 adaptors , the HIP1 – GST - fusion proteins also affinity purify a prominent ~ 180 - kDa polypeptide ( Fig . 3A , left panel , lane f and h ) . Antibodies identify this protein as the clathrin heavy chain and the cognate light chains , although not visible on the stained gel , are also detected on the blots 3 . It is well established that the hinge and appendage regions of the AP - 2 β 2 - subunit interact with clathrin directly ( 14 , 32 ) , yet the observed association of GST - HIP1 with clathrin is not simply due to the presence of bound AP - 2 . No clathrin associates with the GST - SJ170C2 fusion protein , despite it binding similar amounts of AP - 2 ( lane d ) . by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 13 Closer inspection of the HIP1 sequence reveals a putative clathrin box proximal to the AP - 2 - binding elements ( Fig . 1B ) . The sequence , LMDMD , is an unusual variation on the type I consensus L [ L , I ] [ D , E , N ] [ L , F ] [ D , E ] ( 32 ) which binds to a shallow groove located between blades 1 and 2 of the clathrin heavy chain β - propeller ( 19 ) . The role of this region in clathrin binding was probed by altering the sequence to AAAMD ( LMD → AAA ; Fig . 4 ) . Compared to the native sequence ( lane d ) , this mutation abolishes clathrin binding completely but leaves the AP - 2 interaction intact ( lane f ) . This result implicates the LMDMD in binding clathrin directly but , interestingly , in the GST - HIP1M2 ( DPF → KPS ) mutant , which still contains an intact clathrin box , clathrin binding is strongly diminished ( Fig . 3A , lane j ) . These results are identical to the behavior of the clathrin - binding sequence 257 LMDLADV located within the DPW domain of rat epsin 1 , proximal to the tandemly arrayed eight DPW repeats ( 10 ) . There , again , robust clathrin binding is dependent upon AP - 2 recruitment , providing coincident binding motifs for the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain . Transient transfection of a myc - tagged HIP1M1 segment ( residues 311 - 394 ) into COS - 7 cells , like the AP - 2 / clathrin - binding DPW domain of epsin 1 ( 5 ) , inhibits endocytic transferrin uptake ( Fig . 5 ) , although complete inhibition is only seen in less than a third of all transfected cells . HIP1 as an endocytic accessory protein —HIP1 also resembles endocytic accessory proteins in other respects ( Fig . 1A ) . Like amphiphysin and epsin , there is a unique functional module at the carboxyl terminus ; in HIP1 the talin - like I / LWEQ domain . And like epsin and AP180 , sequence analysis algorithms by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 14 predict HIP1 to have ENTH domain . Importantly , the critical Lys and His residues in AP180 required to electrostatically coordinate the negatively charged phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) headgroup ( 13 ) are conserved in both HIP1 and HIP1R ( Fig . 6A ) and indeed murine HIP1 ( 1 - 533 ) binds to polyphosphoinositides ( see below ) . To test the hypothesis that one general function of accessory proteins with this type of domain architecture is to cooperate with AP - 2 to drive clathrin lattice assembly , we assayed clathrin recruitment onto synthetic liposomes containing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The ENTH domain allows the amino - terminal segments of mouse HIP1 ( residues 1 - 533 ) ( Fig . 6B , lane d ) and epsin 1 ( 33 ) ( GST - epsin 1 ( 1 - 407 ) , lane j ) each to bind directly to phosphoinositide - containing liposomes . AP - 2 ( lane f ) also associates with the liposomes directly ( 13 ) , due to a PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding determinant found at the amino terminus of the α subunit ( 34 ) . Attached to the liposome surface , each of these proteins is able to interact with and recruit soluble clathrin ( lane d , f and j ) , while no clathrin sediments with the liposomes in their absence ( lane b ) . Mixing either the HIP1 or epsin protein together with AP - 2 increases the recovery of the adaptor complex with the liposome ( lane h and l ) , validating the interaction surfaces mapped using the affinity interaction assays with GST ( Fig . 3 ) . Importantly , soluble clathrin recruitment onto the liposome surface is markedly more efficient in the presence of both AP - 2 and an AP - 2 – and clathrin - binding accessory protein ( HIP1 , lane h and epsin 1 , lane l compared to lanes d , f and j ) . These results resemble very closely data obtained recently using AP180 and AP - 2 to assemble clathrin lattices upon synthetic lipid membranes ( 13 ) . Thus , several membrane - bound accessory proteins can similarly by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 15 cooperate with AP - 2 to effect efficient clathrin assembly . The close similarity in the behavior of HIP1 and epsin / AP180 in these assays clearly includes HIP1 within the family of endocytic accessory proteins . by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 16 DISCUSSION Huntington disease is a neurodegenerative disorder principally affecting striatial neurons , yet the mutated gene product , huntingtin , is not a brain - restricted protein . Both mRNA and protein is widely expressed in mammalian tissues ( 35 , 36 ) . Broad tissue distribution is true also of both HIP1 and HIP1R ( 28 , 29 ) , hinting at a more general function for these proteins . The intracellular distribution of huntingtin overlaps partly with clathrin ( 37 , 38 ) and a direct association between huntingtin and the α C subunit of AP - 2 has been reported ( 39 ) . HIP1R colocalizes more precisely with clathrin and with AP - 2 in several cell types ( 28 ) and the link between the HIP protein family and endocytosis is validated by Sla2p , the S . cerevisiae orthologue of HIP1 / HIP1R . Sla2p regulates endocytosis and stabilizes actin organization ( 30 , 31 , 40 ) . Like HIP1 , HIP1R is also enriched in brain clathrin - coated vesicles ( 28 ) but the region of HIP1 we identify here to interact directly with the core endocytic machinery is notably absent from HIP1R ( Fig . 1A ) . The conserved sequence L F D Q T F might facilitate binding to the α appendage , but neither an adjacent LMDMD nor a DPF is present in HIP1R . The sequence 348 LIEIS in HIP1R does resemble the β - arrestin 2 type I clathrin - box sequence 374 LIEFE and could possibly confer on HIP1R the capacity to bind to the clathrin heavy chain β - propeller . Alternatively , as the central coiled - coil domain found in both proteins likely mediates dimerization ( 31 , 40 ) and , as there is some evidence for an interaction between HIP1 and HIP1R ( 29 ) , heterodimers of HIP1 and HIP1R , like amphiphysin I and II , may exist . by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 17 The precise role of the AP - 2 and clathrin binding sequences imbedded within many endocytic accessory proteins is a matter of debate ( 2 , 32 ) . Instead of simply targeting accessory proteins to an existing clathrin bud site , our findings and others ( 13 ) indicate rather that when linked to a lipid - binding module , tandemly arrayed AP - 2 - and clathrin - binding sequences could play a more critical role in clathrin - coat biogenesis . Because accessory proteins like AP180 , epsin and HIP1 bind to clathrin directly in the absence of AP - 2 , these proteins could initiate lattice assembly in a phosphoinositide - dependent fashion . S . cerevisiae epsin orthologues Ent1p and Ent2p both have essential ENTH domains and clathrin - binding motifs ( 41 ) , so the coat promoting properties of the accessory proteins could explain the surprising presence of clathrin - coated vesicles and the viability of yeast strains engineered to lack all functional adaptor complexes and AP180 ( 42 , 43 ) . Clustered recruitment of AP - 2 together with or augmented by AP180 , epsin and / or HIP1 will provide a network of clathrin - binding sequences for local amplification of clathrin lattice assembly . By linking physiological clathrin recruitment and assembly to phospholipid metabolism , these accessory proteins allow for precise control of the intracellular location of bud assembly and also link the process to multiple regulatory inputs . Strikingly , while amphiphysin also displays centrally located AP - 2 and clathrin binding sequences ( 6 , 12 , 24 ) analogous to epsin , AP180 and HIP1 , an ENTH domain is not present in this protein . Nevertheless , the N - terminal segment ( the BAR domain ; Bin1 , amphiphysin , Rvs161 / 167 ) of amphiphysin I displays inherent phospholipid binding properties ( 44 ) . by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 18 The diversity of lipid - dependent coat - assembly regulators might possibly facilitate the assembly of functionally different clathrin coats at the cell surface ( 45 ) or impart discrete functions to a single assembling lattice . The carboxyl - terminal I / LWEQ domain of HIP1 is 70 % identical to HIP1R and 34 % identical to Sla2p , proteins known to bind to actin filaments ( 28 , 46 ) , so it seems probable that HIP1 also associates directly with assembled actin . In yeast , a temperature sensitive mutant allele of Sla2p ( end4 - 1 ) was identified in a screen for endocytic mutants ( 30 ) but the I / LWEQ domain does not appear necessary to sustain endocytosis ( 31 ) . This is in line with our observation that the coat assembly properties of mammalian HIP1 reside within the first 533 amino acids . Nonetheless , positioned within the assembling lattice , the I / LWEQ domain in HIP1 could link the clathrin - bud site to the adjacent actin cytoskeleton . Given the enrichment of HIP1 in isolated clathrin coated vesicles , this interaction could potentially explain the dramatic increase in the radial mobility of GFP - clathrin - marked bud sites at the plasma membrane after depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton with jasplakinolide ( 47 ) . The ability of HIP1 to bind to phosphoinositides and actin simultaneously could also be linked to the observation that in neurons derived from synaptojanin 1 knock - out animals , clathrin - coated vesicles accumulate at the nerve terminal enmeshed within an actin - like matrix ( 48 ) . Irrespective , the modular arrangement of proteins like AP180 , epsin , amphiphysin and HIP1 appears to dictate related function in clathrin - coat assembly . by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 19 Acknowledgements We are grateful to Stuart Kornfeld and Gerry Apodaca for constructive comments on our manuscript and to Ora Weisz for the COS - 7 cells and for help with the transfection procedure .

If the density of the GST - α C appendage immobilized on GSH Sepharose is reduced 5 – 10 fold , increasing the relative spacing of the individual appendages , then the FXDXF - bearing SJ170C2 fragment is able to inhibit soluble eps15 and epsin binding , T . J . Brett , D . H Fremont and L . M . Traub , unpublished observations . This supports the notion that the cooperativity of the tandemly arrayed DPF / W triplets in eps15 and epsin prevents efficient competition by the HIP1M1 segment . 3 . . While cytosolic clathrin binds avidly to the HIP1 GST fusions , we note that HIP1M1 reproducibly interacts more efficiently with soluble trimers than the HIP1M2 segment . by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 20 REFERENCES 1 .

A . Domain organization of human ( Hs ) HIP1 . The location of the FXDXF ( red ) , DPF ( cyan ) and clathrin - binding ( green ) sequences is indicated with vertical bars while the regions corresponding to the GST - HIP1 - fusion proteins used in this study are shown below . B . Local sequence alignment of human and mouse ( Mm ) HIP1 and HIP1R sequences . Identical residues are colored pink and conservative substitutions yellow . The locations of the FXDXF ( red ) , DPF ( cyan ) and LMDMD ( green ) motifs in HIP1 are indicated above . Fig . 2 . HIP1 is a component of clathrin - coated vesicles . Aliquots of 20 µ g each of rat brain homogenate , crude microsomes , cytosol and purified clathrin - coated vesicles were fractionated by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue ( left panel ) or transferred to nitrocellulose ( right panels ) and probed with antibodies directed against the clathrin light chains ( LC ) , the µ 2 subunit of the AP - 2 complex , HIP1 , AP180 , epsin 1 , amphiphysin , or synaptotagmin I . The position of the molecular mass standards ( in kDa ) and the ~ 180 - kDa clathrin heavy chain ( HC ) ( left panel ) are indicated on the left and right respectively . Only the relevant portion of each blot ( right panels ) is shown . Proteolysis of the clathrin light chains in the coated vesicle preparation suggests the lower ~ 80 - kDa band detected by the anti - HIP1 antibodies is likely a degradation product . by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 25 Fig . 3 .

After centrifugation , aliquots of 1 / 80 of each supernatant ( S ) and 1 / 8 of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue ( left panel ) or immunoblotted ( right panels ) with antibodies directed against the AP - 2 α - or µ 2 subunit or the clathrin heavy ( HC ) or light chain ( LC ) . B . Immobilized GST ( lane a - d ) or GST - α C appendage ( lane e - h ) were incubated with either rat brain cytosol ( lane a , b , e and f ) or a rat brain detergent extract ( lane c , d , g and h ) . After centrifugation , aliquots of 1 / 80 of each supernatant ( S ) and 1 / 8 of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue ( left panel ) or immunoblotted ( right panels ) with antibodies directed against HIP1 , AP180 or epsin 1 . C . Immobilized GST ( lane a and b ) or GST - α C appendage ( lane c - h ) were incubated with rat brain cytosol alone ( lane a - d ) or supplemented with 20 µ M epsin 1 DPW domain ( lane e and f ) or 20 µ M HIP1M2 fragment ( lane g and h ) . After centrifugation , aliquots of 1 / 80 of each supernatant ( S ) and 1 / 8 of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue ( left panel ) or immunoblotted ( right panels ) with antibodies directed against epsin 1 , eps15 , amphiphysin or AP180 .

Immobilized GST ( lane a and b ) or GST - HIP1M1 ( lane c and d ) or GST - HIP1M1 ( LMD → AAA ) ( lane e and f ) was incubated with rat brain cytosol . After centrifugation , aliquots of 1 / 80 of each supernatant ( S ) and 1 / 8 of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue ( left panel ) or immunoblotted ( right panels ) with antibodies directed against the AP - 2 β - or µ 2 - subunit or the clathrin heavy ( HC ) or light chain ( LC ) . Note that using brain cytosol , the bound AP - 2 complexes contain both the faster migrating β 2 subunit as well as lower amounts of the AP - 1 β 1 subunit ( right panel , lane d and f ) . The promiscuity of β subunit incorporation into AP - 1 and AP - 2 has been described before ( 22 ) . Fig . 5 . Effect of the overexpressed HIP1M1 segment on endocytosis . COS - 7 cells transiently expressing myc - tagged HIP1M1 for 48 hours were serum starved for 60 min and then incubated with biotinylated transferrin for 15 min at 37°C prior to fixation . Endocytosed transferrin was visualized with streptavidin - Alexa 594 ( panel A , red ) and the transfected cells identified with anti - myc mAb 9E10 and then an anti - mouse Alexa 488 conjugate ( panel B , green ) . The merged ( panel C ) image showing both endocytic inhibited ( small arrows , no accumulation of transferrin within perinuclear recycling endosomes ) and uninhibited ( large arrowhead ) cells is also shown . by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 27 Fig . 6 .
