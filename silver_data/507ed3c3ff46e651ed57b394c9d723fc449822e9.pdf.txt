Design Considerations for Collaborative Visual Analytics Jeffrey Heer , Maneesh Agrawala University of California , Berkeley A BSTRACT Information visualization leverages the human visual system to support the process of sensemaking , in which information is collected , organized , and analyzed to generate knowledge and inform action . Though most research to date assumes a single - user focus on perceptual and cognitive processes , in practice , sensemaking is often a social process involving parallelization of effort , discussion , and consensus building . This suggests that to fully support sensemaking , interactive visualization should also support social interaction . However , the most appropriate collaboration mechanisms for supporting this interaction are not immediately clear . In this article , we present design considerations for asynchronous collaboration in visual analysis environments , highlighting issues of work parallelization , communication , and social organization . These considerations provide a guide for the design and evaluation of collaborative visualization systems . CR Categories and Subject Descriptors : H . 5 . 2 .

However , visual analysis and decision making often involve not only perceptual and cognitive processes , but social processes . People may disagree on how to interpret data and contribute contextual knowledge that deepens understanding . As participants build consensus or make decisions they learn from their peers . Furthermore , some data sets are so large that thorough exploration by a single person is unlikely . Such scenarios arise in business intelligence [ 36 ] , intelligence analysis [ 37 , 47 ] , and public data consumption [ 18 ] . In this spirit , a recent report [ 47 ] names the design of collaborative visualization tools as a grand challenge for visualization research . While existing visualization research has explored techniques for collocated collaboration ( e . g . , large displays and shared workspaces ) and synchronous distance work ( e . g . , real - time networked displays ) , little research attention has been paid to asynchronous collaboration around visualizations [ 48 ] . By partitioning work across both time and space , asynchronous collaboration offers greater scalability for group - oriented analysis . There is evidence that , due in part to a greater division of labor , asynchronous decision making can result in higher - quality outcomes (cid:178) broader discussions , more complete reports , and longer solutions (cid:178) than face - to - face collaboration [ 1 ] . One challenge to achieving such benefits is determining the appropriate design decisions and technical mechanisms to enable and catalyze social data analysis around visual media . Previously , we began exploring this space by building and evaluating sense . us , a system for asynchronous collaborative visualization [ 29 ] . Our observations of usage have provided numerous examples of group sensemaking in action : cycles of observation , question , and hypothesis ; social navigation to interesting or controversial data ; and identification of problematic or incorrect data values . We wish to better support these observed behaviors by grounding our design decisions in both theoretical and practical knowledge of group interaction . Furthermore , additional systems have recently been introduced to support collaborative analysis around both statistical and geographic data ( see Figure 2 ) ; each supports simple text comments and view sharing through bookmarking . A theoretically - grounded design framework can be applied to contrast these existing offerings and guide the future research and development of social visual analysis systems . Creating effective mediated collaboration environments raises a number of design questions . How should collaboration be structured , and what shared artifacts can be used to coordinate contributions ? What are the most effective communication mechanisms ? Based upon our experiences to date and a survey of research in analytics , social psychology , sociology , organizational studies , and computer - supported cooperative work , we identify a set of design considerations to inform the development of asynchronous collaborative information visualization systems . We have grouped our design considerations into seven topical areas : Division and allocation of work ; Common ground and awareness ; Reference and deixis ; Incentives and engagement ; Identity , trust , and reputation ; Group dynamics ; and Consensus and decision making . In each of these areas , we discuss the underlying accomplishments that enable effective collaboration , and suggest specific mechanisms by which they could be achieved . As a thorough treatment of these subjects would warrant multiple volumes , we attempt only to identify key issues to guide work in collaborative visualization . After discussing each topical area in turn , we conclude by summarizing the various design considerations presented and suggesting avenues for future research and development in collaborative visual analytics .

This involves both the segmentation of effort into proper units of work and the allocation of individuals to tasks in a manner that best matches their skills and disposition . Primary concerns are how to split work among multiple participants and meaningfully aggregate the results . Benkler [ 2 ] describes the role of modularity , granularity , and cost of integration in the peer production of information goods , drawing on examples such as online discussions , open source software , and Wikipedia . Modularity refers to how work is segmented into atomic units , parallelizing work into independent tasks . The granularity of a module is a measure of the cost or effort involved in performing the task . The optimal granularity of modules is closely tied to the incentives for performing the work . For example , in online scenarios where the incentives tend to be small and non - monetary , a small granularity is needed to facilitate work , encouraging people to participate in part due to the ease of contributing . A variety of granularities enables different classes of contribution to emerge . (cid:55)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:37)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:78)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:82)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3) cost of integration : what effort is required to usefully synthesize the contributions of each individual module ? Collaborative work will only be effective if the cost of integration is low enough to warrant the overhead of modularization while enforcing adequate quality control . There are a number of mutually inclusive approaches to handling integration : automation ( automatically integrating work through technological means ) , peer production ( casting integration as an additional collaborative task given to trusted participants ) , social norms ( using social pressures to reduce vandalistic behavior ) , and hierarchical control ( exercising explicit moderation ) . Questions for collaborative visualization include how to facilitate the modularization of work . The first step is determining the modules of work and their granularity . Existing frameworks for aiding this task include structural models of visualization design and sensemaking processes . Once modules have been identified , one can then attempt designs which reduce the cost structure for these tasks . Another important concern is the proscription of particular task types or roles (cid:178) what aspects should be formally inscribed in the system and what should be left open to negotiation and definition by work groups themselves ? 2 . 1 T HE I NFORMATION V ISUALIZATION R EFERENCE M ODEL One model for identifying modules of contribution is the information visualization reference model [ 9 , 28 ] , a general Figure 2 . Asynchronous Collaborative Visualization Systems . Clockwise from top - left , Spotfire Decision Site Posters [ 43 ] , Wikimapia [ 50 ] , Swivel [ 46 ] , Sense . us [ 29 ] , and Many Eyes [ 33 ] . These systems support varied levels of sharing , discussion , and annotation of visualized data . 172 pattern for describing visualization applications ( Figure 1 ) . The model decomposes the visualization process into data acquisition and representation , visual encoding of data , and display and interaction . Each phase of this model provides an entry point for collaborative activity . Contributions involving data include uploading data sets , cleaning or reformatting data , moderating contributed data ( e . g . , to safeguard copyright or privacy concerns ) , and affixing metadata ( e . g . , providing keyword tags ) . Additional contributions of varying granularity lie in the application of visual encodings . Examples include matching data sets with existing visualization components , editing visual mappings to form more effective visualizations , and authoring visualization software components . Both Many Eyes [ 33 ] and Swivel [ 46 ] enable contribution of data sets and visual mappings . The primary focus of this paper , however , is at the level of interaction , where we consider how collaborative visual analysis and exploration can effectively be conducted . 2 . 2 T HE S ENSEMAKING M ODEL To better understand analytic contributions , we consult the sensemaking model [ 9 , 39 ] , which grounds the use of information visualization in a theory of how people search for , organize , and create new knowledge from source information . Social issues accrue at each phase of the model : how do people communicate , (cid:75)(cid:82)(cid:90)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:77)(cid:88)(cid:71)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:69)(cid:88)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:82)(cid:90)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:83)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:15)(cid:3) and what motivates contributions ? Each of these issues is addressed in subsequent sections . As indicated by the numerous interconnections in Figure 3 , the sensemaking process has a much higher degree of coupling than the information visualization reference model , carrying implications for the granularity and integration of contributions . Intelligence analysis provides examples of both cooperative and competitive models of work [ 47 ] . In cooperative scenarios , modules may be of fine granularity and pooled such that collaborators can immediately benefit from the work of others . Examples include identifying relevant information sources , connections between sources , and positing hypotheses . Such work may involve tightly coupled collaboration , requiring awareness and communication among participants . In competitive scenarios , modules are larger and work is not integrated until a later stage of sensemaking , such as detailed , evidence - backed hypotheses or recommended actions . While lacking the benefits of resource pooling , this approach encourages individual assessment and can reduce groupthink bias . Accordingly , it may benefit collaborative visualization systems to support both fine - grained and coarse - grained work parallelization . If adopting a competitive model , the main concern is with integrating the end results of the sensemaking process . How can analytic conclusions or suggested actions be presented , compared , and evaluated ? This gives rise to a consensus and decision making problem of its own , an issue discussed later . If cooperative models are used , either across all collaborators or within teams , we should consider social issues affecting each phase of sensemaking . 2 . 2 . 1 I NFORMATION F ORAGING The first such phase is information foraging [ 36 ] . Given the underlying metaphor of foraging for food , an activity often performed by social packs of animals , social information foraging [ 35 ] seems a natural extension . This argues for collaborators to pool findings , such as discovery of relevant information , and to support notification updates and information retrieval . Challenges include formalizing contributions , such as identifying trends or outliers of interest and positing explanatory hypotheses , and providing retrieval mechanisms by which others can access them . Additional possibilities lie in analyzing and displaying activity traces to facilitate social navigation [ 20 ] , metaphorically similar to the scent trails left by ants foraging for food . In this form , general usage itself can be treated as an implicit module of work , a possibility discussed further in section 3 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 I NFORMATION S CHEMATIZATION The next phases of sensemaking concern the construction and population of information schemata . This could be conducted in a general form by enabling discussion amongst collaborators . One challenge is to synthesize the results of discussion into more accessible forms , such as summaries of arguments and evidence . The cost structure of these tasks could be further reduced , and the integration of contributions facilitated by , providing additional shared artifacts or external representations [ 53 ] for structuring group work . For example , the analytic sandbox of [ 51 ] provides a visual environment for spatially organizing hypotheses and positive and negative evidence , while [ 3 ] describes a system for collaborative use of analytic evidence matrices . 2 . 2 . 3 P ROBLEM - S OLVING , D ECISION - M AKING , AND A CTION The final phases of sensemaking involve problem - solving and action . This may or may not take place within the collaborative analysis environment . Findings gained from analysis may serve as input to collaboration in other media , suggesting the need to both facilitate external access to the contents of the visual analysis environment and extracting content for use in other systems . If problem - solving and decision making are conducted within the system , aforementioned issues regarding communication , discussion , and consensus must be addressed . 3 C OMMON G ROUND AND A WARENESS Inspired by linguistics , social psychologists have investigated fundamental prerequisites for successful communication . Clark and Brennan describe the concept of common ground [ 15 ] , the shared understanding between conversational participants enabling communication . Through shared experience and discussion , people constantly monitor their mutual understanding . For example , facial expressions , body language , and backchannel (cid:88)(cid:87)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:88)(cid:75) - (cid:75)(cid:88)(cid:75)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:75)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:34)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:3) grounding cues (cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3) (cid:68)(cid:3) (cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3) (cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3) (cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:3) (cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3) (cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:17)(cid:3) (cid:37)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:3) (cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:3) evidence of convergence of understanding and negative evidence of misunderstanding are used to establish common ground . Interestingly , an imperfect shared understanding is often sufficient . The principle of least collaborative effort states that conversational participants will exert just enough effort to achieve Figure 3 . The Sensemaking Cycle . The diagram depicts the various phases and loops of the sensemaking process , annotated with common tasks . The image is taken from Card et al [ 9 ] . 173 successful communication [ 13 ] . Collaborative effort may be applied during both a planning stage , in which a participant formulates their next utterance , and an acceptance stage , in which a participant ascertains if partners have understood the utterance . This principle serves as an evaluation guide for collaboration mechanisms based on their effect upon the cost structure of interaction . For example , multiple studies have shown that the media of communication affects the cost structure of collaborative effort [ 4 , 21 ] : views of a shared visual environment minimize the need to verbally confirm actions that can be assessed visually . However , media effects such as latency can hamper the efficiency benefits of such cues [ 21 ] . At both general and detailed levels , grounding theory provides a useful guide for design decisions . When collaborating around visualizations , participants must be able to see the same visual (cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3) (cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3) (cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3) (cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3) (cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3) (cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3) (cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3) (cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:3) (cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3) comments , suggesting the need for mechanisms for bookmarking or sharing specific states of the visualization . This includes both sharing within the visualization environment itself and across other media . For example , the results of visual analysis might effectively be shared embedded in an external web page , where common ground is better established within a dedicated , familiar readership . At minimum , the ability to easily pass around pointers ( e . g . , URLs ) to specific views is indispensable . This entails that collaborative visualizations be able to explicitly represent and export their internal state space [ 29 , 48 ] . 3 . 1 D ISCUSSION M ODELS Given the ability to access a shared viewpoint , one must still determine the forms of discussion and annotation around that view . For example , one could use visualization bookmarks within a standard discussion forum , interspersing links to desired views within the text . This form of independent discussion is unidirectional , linking from text to the visualization . Independent , unthreaded comments are used by both Decision Site Posters [ 43 ] and Many Eyes [ 33 ] . Another approach is embedded discussion , placing conversational markers directly within the visualization , such as comments over annotated geographic regions in Wikimapia [ 50 ] . This approach provides unidirectional links that point from the visualization to text . Grounding might be further facilitated by more deeply tying independent discussion to the visualization state space . Doubly - linked commentary [ 29 ] allows comments to link to specific views as in independent discussion , while also enabling all such discussions to be retrieved in situ as visualization views are visited . Our hypothesis is that directly associating commentary with specific states of the visualization will facilitate grounding by disambiguating the context of discussion , while also enabling serendipitous discovery of relevant discussion during exploration . Evidence for this hypothesis could take the form of simplified referential utterances or facilitation of reader comprehension . 3 . 2 A WARENESS Another important source of grounding comes from awareness of others (cid:182) activities , allowing collaborators to gauge what work has been done and where to allocate effort next [ 10 , 19 ] . Within asynchronous contexts , participants require awareness of the timing and content of past actions . This suggests that designs should include both history and notification mechanisms ( e . g . , [ 6 ] ) for following actions performed on a given artifact or by specific individuals or groups . Browseable histories of past action are one viable mechanism , as are subscription and notification technologies such as RSS ( Really Simple Syndication ) and Atom . User activity can also be aggregated and abstracted to provide additional forms of awareness . Social navigation [ 20 ] involves the use of activity traces to provide additional navigation options , allowing users to purposefully navigate to past states of high interest or explore less - (cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3) (cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:3) (cid:11)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3) (cid:179)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76) - social (cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:62)(cid:23)(cid:28)(cid:64) ) . For example , navigation cues may be added to links to views with low visitation rates or to action items such as unanswered questions and unassessed hypotheses . 4 R EFERENCE AND D EIXIS A vital aspect of grounding is successfully referring to artifacts , people , places , or other items . As discussed by both Clark [ 12 ] and Brennan [ 4 ] , reference can take on many different forms ; we focus on reference in spatial contexts . When collaborating around visual media , it is common to refer to specific objects , groups , or regions visible to participants . Such references may be general (cid:11)(cid:72)(cid:17)(cid:74)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:3) (cid:179)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:3) (cid:69)(cid:92)(cid:3) (cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:90)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:180)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:3) definite ( e . g . , named entities ) , detailed (cid:11)(cid:72)(cid:17)(cid:74)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:69)(cid:88)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:88)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:180)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3) deictic (cid:11)(cid:72)(cid:17)(cid:74)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:3) (cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3) (cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3) (cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:3) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:77)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:3) (cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3) (cid:86)(cid:68)(cid:92)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3) (cid:179)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3) (cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:180)(cid:15)(cid:3) (cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:3) referred to as indexical reference ) . Once the referent has been successfully established and grounding has been achieved between participants , collaboration can move forward . Clark [ 12 ] surveys various forms of spatial indexical reference , grouping them into the categories of pointing and placing . Pointing behaviors use some form of vectorial reference to direct attention to an object , group , or region of interest , such as pointing (cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:93)(cid:72)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:51)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:89)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3) an object to a region of space that has a shared , conventional meaning . Examples include placing groceries on a counter to indicate items for purchase and standing across from the teller to indicate that you will be the purchaser . In addition to directing attention , indexical reference allows patterns of speech and text to change .

They go on to state that successfully supporting deixis is key to the future of visualization applications . While other forms of reference are often most easily achieved through speech or written text , deictic reference in particular offers important interface design challenges for collaborative visualization . Our hypothesis is that methods for performing nuanced pointing behaviors can improve collaboration by favorably altering its cost structure . Hill and Hollan make this (cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:91)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:74)(cid:88)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:84)(cid:88)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:93)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:91)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:72) - attentive (cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:74)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:78)(cid:86)(cid:180)(cid:17)(cid:3) An additional concern is ambiguity of reference . Clark et al (cid:62)(cid:20)(cid:23)(cid:64)(cid:3) (cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:3) (cid:75)(cid:82)(cid:90)(cid:3) (cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:82)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3) (cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3) (cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3) (cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:3) (cid:68)(cid:73)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:3) ambiguity resolution . Thus , two people with greater familiarity might successfully communicate using ambiguous references , while a third participant remains confused . By providing interaction techniques for pointing that facilitate unambiguous references , designers might not only aid human communication , but allow for machine - readable forms of pointing or annotation , supporting a navigable index of references . For example , this 174 could allow users to search for all commentary or visualizations that reference a particular data item . Another design consideration is how various forms of reference may be applied in tandem . For example , one might deictically refer to a particular object , but formulate a broader selection by (cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3) (cid:73)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:3) (cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3) (cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3) (cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3) (cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:77)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:3) (cid:11)(cid:72)(cid:17)(cid:74)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:3) (cid:179)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:3) (cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:3) (cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:88)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:78)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:180)(cid:12)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:55)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:90)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:3) gesture and text , often segmented in time and interpreted subconsciously in synchronous interactions , may need to be more concretely reified in asynchronous contexts . For example , a text comment involving multiple deictic terms may need to link those terms explicitly to visual annotations , as the gestural cues used in face - to - face communication are not available for disambiguation . 5 I NCENTIVES AND E NGAGEMENT If collaborators are professionals working within a particular context ( e . g . , financial analysts or research scientists ) there may be existing incentives , both financial and professional , for conducting collaborative work . In a public goods scenario , incentives such as social visibility or sense of contribution may be the motivating factors . Incorporating incentives into the design process may increase the quantity and / or quality of contributions , and could even provide additional motivation in those situations that already have well established incentive systems . Benkler [ 2 ] posits an incentive structure for collaborative work consisting of monetary incentives , hedonic incentives , and social - psychological incentives . Monetary incentives refer to material compensation such as a salary or cash reward . Hedonic incentives refer to well - being or engagement experienced intrinsically in the work . Social - psychological incentives involve perceived benefits such as increased status or social capital . 5 . 1 P ERSONAL R ELEVANCE A number of observations of social use of visualization have noted an affinity of visualization users for data which they find personally relevant [ 27 , 48 , 49 ] . For example , collaborative visual analysis of the occupations of American workers [ 29 ] often started by searching for their own profession and those of their friends and family , similar to how people searched for names in the popular NameVoyager visualization [ 49 ] . The hypothesis is that by selecting data sets or designing their presentation such that the data is seen as personally relevant , usage rates will rise due to increased hedonic incentive . For example , geographic visualizations can facilitate navigation to personally relevant locations through typing in specific zip codes or city names . 5 . 2 S OCIAL - P SYCHOLOGICAL I NCENTIVES In the case of social - psychological incentives , the visibility of contributions can be manipulated for social effects . Ling et al [ 32 ] found that users contributed more if reminded of the uniqueness of their contribution or if given specific challenges , but not under other theoretically - motivated conditions . Cheshire [ 11 ] ran a controlled experiment finding that , even in small doses , positive social feedback on a contribution greatly increases contributions . He also found that visibility of high levels of cooperative behavior across the community increases contributions in the short term , but has only moderate impact in the long term . These studies suggest that social - psychological incentives can improve contribution rates , but that the forms of social visibility applied have varying returns . One such incentive for visual analysis is to prominently display new discoveries or successful responses to open questions . Mechanisms for positive feedback , such as voting for interesting comments , might also foster more contributions . 5 . 3 G AME P LAY Finally , it is worth considering game play as an additional framework for increasing incentives . In contrast to environments such as spreadsheets , many visualizations already enjoy game - like properties , being highly visual , highly interactive , and often animated . Heer [ 27 ] discusses various examples in which playful activity contributes to analysis , applying insights from an existing theory of playful behavior [ 8 ] that analyzes the competitive , visceral , and teamwork building aspects of play . For example , scoring mechanisms could be applied to create competitive social - psychological incentives . Game design might also be used to allocate attention , for example , by creating a team - oriented (cid:179) scavenger hunt (cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:86) game focused on a particular subject matter . Salen and Zimmerman [ 40 ] provide a thorough resource for the further study of game design concepts . 6 I DENTITY , T RUST , AND R EPUTATION Aspects of identity , reputation , and trust all influence the way people interact with each other . Other things being equal , a hypothesis suggested by a more trusted or reputable person will have a higher probability of being accepted as part of the group consensus [ 34 ] . For social sensemaking in a computer - mediated environment , design challenges accrue around the various markers of identity and past action that might be transmitted through the system . For example , Donath [ 17 ] describes how even a cue as (cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3) e - mail address can lead to a number of inferences about identity and status . 6 . 1 I DENTITY P RESENTATION Many theorists try to understand interpersonal perception via the signals available for interpretation by others . Goffman [ 23 ] distinguishes between expressions given and expressions given off to indicate those parts of our presentation of self that are consciously planned ( e . g . , the content of our speech ) or unconsciously generated ( e . g . , a wavering of voice indicating nervousness ) , each of which is interpreted to form opinions of a person . Donath [ 17 ] classifies such signals into conventional signals (cid:178) low cost signals that are easy to fake ( e . g . , talking about going to the gym ) (cid:178) and assessment signals (cid:178) more reliable signals that are difficult to fabricate ( e . g . , having large muscles ) . When considering the implications of identity assessment for designing collaborative visualization systems , it is important to take into account the context of deployment . If collaborators are already familiar to each other , there may be little that needs to be done to support identity and reputation formation , as there are existing channels through which this can be conducted . It may be (cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:74)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:73)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:88)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:69)(cid:88)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:3) with recognizable names . Many organizations maintain online personnel directories to aid awareness and collaboration ; visual analysis systems should be able to leverage such existing artifacts . On the other hand , if collaborators begin as strangers , mechanisms for self - presentation and reputation formation need to be included in the system design . Possible mechanisms include identity markers , such as screen names , demographic profiles , social networks , and group memberships . Considerations include the type of personal information germane to the context of visual analysis ; for example , is a playful or professional environment desired ? Attributes such as age , geographic location , interests , and (cid:86)(cid:78)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:75)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:83)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:78)(cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:78)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:90)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:15)(cid:3) affecting the confidence one places in hypotheses . Of course , this picture is complicated if such measures are self - reported conventional signals subject to fabrication . This raises the challenge of crafting assessment signals of identity and reputation . 175 6 . 2 R EPUTATION F ORMATION Considering how interpersonal assessment develops over time gives rise to questions of reputation and trust formation . In the case where participants only interact through the system itself , (cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:88)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:69)(cid:88)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3) to not only aid awareness ( cf . § 3 ) but to facilitate reputation formation . Observations of past actions provide implicit means of reputation formation , allowing collaborators to make inter - personal judgments grounded in past activity . One challenge for design is to consider what pieces of information are most informative for reputation formation . Some systems instead provide explicit reputation mechanisms , such as seller ratings in online markets such as eBay [ 38 ] . In a visual analysis environment , collaborators migh (cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3) contributions according to their interestingness or accuracy . This may help surface contributions with higher relevance , provide a reputation metric for contributors , and provide a social - psychological incentive for high quality contributions . 7 G ROUP D YNAMICS The makeup of collaborative groups is another aspect important to social sensemaking . Many scenarios , such as business and research , may involve work groups that are already well established . In such cases , standard group management and communication features common to many collaborative applications may be sufficient . However , when organizing effort in public goods scenarios , explicit mechanisms for assisting group formation may aid collaborative visualization efforts . 7 . 1 G ROUP M ANAGEMENT At a basic level , formal group management mechanisms present useful means for addressing issues of scalability and privacy . Group management mechanisms can support the coordination of a work group on a specific task within a larger collaborative environment , providing notification and awareness features at the group level . Groups also provide a means of filtering contributions , improving tractability and reducing information overload for participants who may not be interested in the contributions of strangers . Finally , groups provide a means of limiting contribution visibility , providing one mechanism for individual privacy within large - scale online scenarios . 7 . 2 G ROUP S IZE One challenge for group management is the choice of group size . Larger groups may be able to achieve more through a larger labor pool , but can incur social and organizational costs . For example , larger groups are more likely to suffer from the free rider problem due to diluted accountability [ 25 ] . Pirolli [ 35 ] describes a mathematical model of social information foraging that measures the benefit of including additional collaborators in information gathering tasks . His analysis finds that beyond certain sizes , additional foragers provide decreasing benefits , suggesting that an optimal group size exists , dependent on the parameters of the foraging task . A useful future experiment would be to apply (cid:51)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:90)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:78)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:80)(cid:86)(cid:17) 7 . 3 G ROUP D IVERSITY Another issue facing group formation is the diversity of group members . In this case diversity can include the distribution of domain - specific knowledge among potential participants and other differences such as geographical location , culture , and gender . Organizational studies [ 16 , 42 ] find that increased group diversity can lead to greater coverage of information and improved decision making . However , diversity can also lead to increased discord and longer decision times . Various measurements of diversity may be applied to suggest a set of group members to gain adequate coverage for an analysis task . Such measurements might come from analyzing differences (cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:90)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:88)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3) networks [ 7 ] . Such networks may be explicitly articulated or inferred from communication patterns , such as the co - occurrence of commenters across discussion threads . (cid:58)(cid:88)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:62)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:64)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:71)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3) organizational information flow found that information spreads efficiently among homophilous group members but not across community boundaries , further suggesting the value of identifying structural holes and directing bridging individuals in the social network towards particular findings . 8 C ONSENSUS AND D ECISION M AKING The need to establish group consensus arises in many phases of the sensemaking cycle . Examples include agreement about the data to collect , how to organize and interpret data , and making decisions based upon the data . Consensus may arise through discussion or may involve the aggregation of individual decisions . 8 . 1 C ONSENSUS AND D ISCUSSION Mohammed [ 34 ] combines various contributions in social psychology and organizational studies to posit a model for cognitive consensus in group - decision making . This model takes into account the assumptions , category labels , content domains , and causal models possessed by each participant , and how they can evolve through discussion . One tangible recommendation that comes from this work is to clearly identify the points of dissent , creating focal points for further discussion and negotiation . From a design perspective , this suggests the need for communication mechanisms that allow such items to be labeled and addressed . Collaborative tagging [ 24 ] is one potential candidate . Scheff [ 41 ] notes that consensus requires more than participants simply sharing a belief ; participants must believe that their beliefs are the same , and achieve realization that others (cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3) position . This implies the need for feedback loops for gauging mutual understanding . Along these lines , it may be useful to consider the effects of multiple communication channels on decision processes . Collaborative visualization environments that provide messaging , in either synchronous or asynchronous forms , might provide backchannels for negotiation and non - public discussion . The integration of instant messaging into the GMail e - mail service provides an example of how different communication channels can be weaved together in a single system . The value of different forms of consensus can vary based on the task at hand . Hastie [ 26 ] found that group discussion improved accuracy when decision tasks had demonstrably correct solutions , allowing groups to evaluate their output . When task outcomes are open - ended , consensus through discussion is harder to evaluate . In a simulated graduate admissions task , Gigone and Hastie [ 22 ] found little value in discussion , as group decisions were well - matched by simply averaging prior individual decisions . One design implication that again arises is the use of voting or ranking systems . Mechanisms for expressing support or disdain for hypotheses could aid data interpretation and further identify controversial points . For example , Wikimapia users can vote on the accuracy of labeled geographic regions and Swivel supports ratings of interestingness . A game - like variation on this approach is the creation of prediction markets [ 45 ] : individuals can be given (cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:80)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:92)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3) vote for hypotheses they find most promising . Hypotheses that are later validated could reap payback rewards for their supporters . 176 8 . 2 I NFORMATION D ISTRIBUTION AND P RESENTATION An important dimension of group consensus is the distribution of information across group members . Both Stasser [ 44 ] and Gigone and Hastie [ 22 ] find that groups generally do not successfully pool information , biasing decision - making in the direction of the initial information distribution . This may be due to the inertia of individual decisions made prior to discussion or due to already - shared information providing common ground for discussion , biasing conversation against the unshared information . A potential benefit of collaborative analysis is better information pooling , providing a record of findings and opinions that can be surveyed prior to decision - making and discussion . Improving collective information foraging may help inform group decision - making by changing the information distribution . Common forms of information exchange in group sensemaking are reports and presentations . Narrative presentation of analysis (cid:179)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:180)(cid:3) is a natural and often effective way to communicate analytic findings , and has been observed as a primary use of (cid:54)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:73)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3) (cid:39)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3) (cid:54)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:3) (cid:51)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:3) (cid:62)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:64)(cid:17)(cid:3) (cid:55)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3) (cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:3) (cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3) collaborative visualization is to provide mechanisms to aid the creation and distribution of presentations . For example , the sense . us system [ 29 ] allows users to construct and share trails of related views to create tours spanning multiple visualizations . This approach could be further improved with support to build presentations semi - automatically using interaction histories , export such presentations into external media , and apply previously discussed pointing techniques . Bookmarking can also enable recipients of a presentation to backtrack to the original visualization to conduct more analysis or verification . 9 C ONCLUSION A ND F UTURE D IRECTIONS This article presents design considerations for collaborative visual analytics , attempting to identify accomplishments which facilitate collaboration and suggest mechanisms for achieving them . Highlights include a list of collaborative visualization tasks , techniques to improve shared context and awareness , and suggestions for increasing engagement and allocating effort . Many of these considerations are summarized in Table 1 . The overarching goal is to effectively parallelize work , facilitate mutual understanding , and reduce the costs of collaborative tasks . Visiting these considerations also provides an agenda for future research in collaborative visual analytics , surfacing hypotheses in need of study and suggesting new technical mechanisms : What is the effect of different discussion models ( e . g . , independent , embedded , doubly - linked ) on participation and the establishment of common ground ? Beyond textual discussion , what external representations will effectively support collaborative analysis ? How do such artifacts affect grounding and the cost of integration ? How can the synthesis of individual contributions be improved ? Can ( semi - ) automatic summarization or merging of separately developed data views ( e . g . , [ 5 ] ) be used to form aggregated contributions ? How should selection and visual emphasis techniques be designed to provide nuanced pointing behaviors ? Can referenced objects be unambiguously recognized by both human and machine collaborators ? How can pointing and graphical annotation gracefully handle dynamic visualizations and changing data sets ? How should social navigation cues be effectively added to visual analysis tools to unobtrusively improve awareness ? Can automated techniques be used to help allocate effort ? For example , mining past contributions , user profiles , and inferred social networks may enable systems to direct collaborators to tasks in need of attention . How can the fruits of collaborative visual analysis be more effectively exported , shared and embedded in external media such as web pages , e - mail , and presentations ? These and other challenges present exciting opportunities for advancing visual analytics research .
