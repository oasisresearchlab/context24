Hall , ‡ Mingming Wu , ‡ * and Chung - Yuen Hui † * † Field of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics , Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and ‡ Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering , Cornell University , Ithaca , New York ABSTRACT In vitro , animal cells are mostly cultured on a gel substrate . It was recently shown that substrate stiffness affects cellular behaviors in a signiﬁcant way , including adhesion , differentiation , and migration . Therefore , an accurate method is needed to characterize the modulus of the substrate . In situ microscopic measurements of the gel substrate modulus are based on Hertz contact mechanics , where Young’s modulus is derived from the indentation force and displacement measurements . In Hertz theory , the substrate is modeled as a linear elastic half - space with an inﬁnite depth , whereas in practice , the thickness of the substrate , h , can be comparable to the contact radius and other relevant dimensions such as the radius of the indenter or steel ball , R . As a result , measurements based on Hertz theory overestimate the Young’s modulus . In this work , we discuss the limitations of Hertz theory and then modify it , taking into consideration the nonlinearity of the material and large deformation using a ﬁnite - element method . We present our results in a simple correction factor , j , the ratio of the corrected Young’s modulus and the Hertz modulus in the parameter regime of d / h % min ( 0 . 6 , R / h ) and 0 . 3 % R / h % 12 . 7 . The j factor depends on two dimensionless parameters , R / h and d / h ( where d is the indentation depth ) , both of which are easily accessible to experiments . This correction factor agrees with experimental observations obtained with the use of polyacrylamide gel and a microsphere indentation method in the parameter range of 0 . 1 % d / h % 0 . 4 and 0 . 3 % R / h % 6 . 2 . The effect of adhesion on the use of Hertz theory for small indentation depth is also discussed . INTRODUCTION Mechanical signals play important roles in directing cellular behaviors including adhesion , migration , differentiation , and cell - cell communications ( 1 – 5 ) . When grown on a substrate coated with proteins ( e . g . , naturally derived extra - cellular matrix ( ECM ) collagen ) , many cell types , such as ﬁbroblasts , endothelial cells , smooth muscle cells , and mesenchymal stem cells , exert forces on the substrate ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 7 ) . In turn , the stiffness of the substrate inﬂuences the cellular behavior through linkages between the integrins presented on the cell membrane and ECM . Early work from the Wang laboratory revealed that substrate stiffness regu - lates both focal adhesions and cell locomotion ( 2 ) . Work from the Discher laboratory demonstrated that stem cells choose their cell differentiation lineage depending on the substrate stiffness , i . e . , mesenchymal stem cells grown on soft , medium , or rigid substrates develop into neurogenic , myogenic , or osteogenic cells , respectively ( 1 ) . Recent work from Reinhart - King’s laboratory showed that endothe - lial cell network formation is mediated by the substrate stiff - ness , which has a direct impact on our understanding of the formation of vascular tissue ( 4 ) . Our increasing appreciation of the cellular mechanical environment demands a new set of tools to accurately char - acterize the mechanical properties of soft materials in situ . To date , much of what we have learned about the roles of mechanical forces in various physiological processes has been derived from observations of cells plated on hydrogel substrates with tunable stiffness ( 1 – 4 ) . Traditional methods for measuring the modulus , such as rheometry and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , are expensive and low - throughput , and cannot be carried out in situ under cell culture conditions . Therefore , investigators have developed a number of novel techniques to either measure the Young’s modulus of a substrate in situ or directly probe the traction force of cells plated on a specially engineered substrate ( 8 – 21 ) . Of almost all of the in situ measurement techniques , the widely used microscopic indentation method pioneered by the Wang laboratory is the easiest one to implement in a biology laboratory ( 22 ) . Brieﬂy , the indentation displacement of a gel by a microsphere ( e . g . , a micrometer - scale steel ball or a glass indenter ; see Fig . 1 ) is measured with a microscope , and the Young’s modulus is derived by means of Hertz contact theory . This method is especially appealing to biology laboratorians because 1 ) , it provides straightforward measurements and can be carried out quickly under cell culture conditions ; 2 ) , it is compatible with microscopy , which is used to observe cellular behavior ; 3 ) , it does not require instruments that are expensive and not normally available in a biology laboratory ( e . g . , a rheometer or atomic force microscope ) ; and 4 ) , it is high - throughput . The current microscopic indentation method , however , is limited by the assumptions made in Hertz contact theory . Hertz contact theory assumes that the microsphere indenter is in contact with a gel of inﬁnite half - space . This cannot be easily satisﬁed in the laboratory , because of the ways in which gels are made in the laboratory , as well as the need Submitted January 20 , 2011 , and accepted for publication June 28 , 2011 . * Correspondence : ch45 @ cornell . edu or mw272 @ cornell . edu Editor : Andrew McCulloch .

The most commonly used gel , polyacrylamide , is made by sandwich - ing a mixture of polymer precursor and its cross - linking agent between two glass coverslips . A thin gel is much easier to process to achieve a uniform gelation throughout the gel , and a thick gel degrades the imaging quality . As a result , the most commonly used gel thickness in the inden - tation method is in the range of 50 – 200 m m ( 22 , 23 ) . The microspheres , which are commercially available , usually have a radius of 150 – 625 m m ( 22 ) . These conditions violate the Hertz assumption and lead to an overestimation of the modulus ( 22 , 23 ) . In this work , we ﬁrst review the limitations of Hertz theory in the context of the microscopic indentation method . We then present a simple expression for a correction factor , j , the ratio of the corrected and Hertz moduli , as a function of R / h and d / h , where R is the indenter radius , d is the indenta - tion displacement , and h is the gel thickness . The computed correction factor is obtained via a ﬁnite - element simulation that accounts for large deformation and material nonlinearity in the parameter regime of d / h % min ( 0 . 6 , R / h ) and 0 . 5 % R / h % 12 . 7 . This correction factor reproduces the result of Dimitriadis et al . ( 21 ) based on linear elasticity theory at the small - strain limit d / h % 0 . 1 . It is consistent with experi - mental measurements obtained with the use of polyacryl - amide gel of various thicknesses and the microsphere indentation method using stainless steel or glass spheres in the parameter regime of 0 . 1 % d / h % 0 . 4 and 0 . 3 % R / h % 6 . 2 . This work extends the capability of the current micro - scopic indentation method for characterizing soft gels . MATERIALS AND METHODS Computation methods Hertz theory and its limitations Hertz theory was developed to explain nonadhesive contact between two elastic spheres . By assigning zero curvature to one of the spheres , one can readily extend Hertz theory to the case of a sphere indenting on an elastic half - space . To adapt Hertz theory to the microsphere indentation experiments , we note that the modulus of the microsphere ( a steel or glass ball ) is at least six orders of magnitude higher than the substrate , and thus can be considered as a rigid body . The Young’s modulus E of an inﬁnitely thick gel indented by a rigid microsphere is related to the indentation force F and the measured indentation depth or displacement d by E ¼ 3 ð 1 (cid:2) v 2 Þ F 4 R 1 = 2 d 3 = 2 ; ( 1 ) where R is the radius of the indenter , F is the weight of the microsphere minus the buoyancy , and v is the Poisson’s ratio of the substrate . We assume n ¼ 0 . 5 in this work , because indentation experiments are typically carried out in a short time ( i . e . , within several minutes ) . In this regime , there is not enough time for the small solvent molecules to migrate in or out of the gel network ( 24 ) . Indeed , one can estimate the diffusion timescale using the gel modulus , viscosity of water , typical experimental dimensions ( contact radius ) , and permeability of the gel network ( 25 ) . Based on previous data ( 26 ) , we estimate the permeability of our polyacrylamide gel to be 5 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 19 m 2 . Using a typical contact radius ( 100 ~ 250 m m ) and gel modulus ( ~ 1000 Pa ) , we estimate the diffusion timescale to be 5 – 31 h , which is much longer than our experimental timescale . As a result , the gels behave as incompressible materials in the microsphere indentation experiments . The indentation depth , d , is deﬁned with respect to a remote point in the specimen where the deformation is identically zero ( e . g . , point P in Fig . 1 ) . The dotted horizontal line in Fig . 1 represents the surface of the undeformed substrate just before contact . The indentation depth is the sum of two displacements : d ¼ d 1 þ d 2 ; ( 2a ) where d 2 ¼ a 2 = ð 2 R Þ ( 2b ) using the small - angle approximation ( see inset of Fig . 1 ) and a as the contact radius . Recall that in Hertz theory , d ¼ a 2 = R h d H : ( 3 ) Equations 2 and 3 imply that d 1 ¼ d 2 in Hertz theory . Eq . 1 , or Hertz theory , is derived based on the following assumptions : 1 . The displacements and strains of the substrate are assumed to be small so that a linearized continuum theory can be used . In particular , there is no distinction between the deformed and undeformed conﬁgurations of the contacting bodies as far as force equilibrium is concerned . These assumptions allow the sphere to be replaced by a paraboloid . 2 . The gel substrate is an inﬁnite half - space ( i . e . , h ¼ N ) . Physically , this means that its thickness is large in comparison with all other relevant length scales in the experiment ( e . g . , the contact radius a ) . 3 . The contact surfaces are assumed to be frictionless so that the shear trac - tions acting on them are identically zero . 4 . No adhesion between the indenter and the substrate , for otherwise normal tensile stress can be supported near the edge of contact . This assumption , together with assumption 3 , implies that contact stress is compressive . For a thin gel substrate , assumption 2 is usually violated in experiments . Asa result , Eq . 1tendstopredictamuchhigherelasticmodulus , alimitation that is widely recognized in the literature ( 22 ) . For example , in the micro - sphere experiments of Reinhart - King et al . ( 23 ) , the measured Young’s modulus based on Eq . 1 is found to decrease signiﬁcantly with substrate thickness . Speciﬁcally , the modulus is 17 , 500 Pa for a gel thickness of 50 m m . It decreases to 2500 Pa when the gel thickness is 200 m m . In their study , the modulus of the gel is taken to be 2500 Pa . Their implicit assump - tion is that a gel thickness of 200 m m is sufﬁciently thick to approach the FIGURE 1 Schematics of the microsphere indentation method . A micro - sphere with radius R is in contact with a soft gel layer of thickness h . The bottom of the gel is adhered to a glass slide . Heavy dotted lines indicate the surface of the elastic substrate and the sphere ( rigid ) just before contact . The geometry after contact is indicated by solid lines . The point P is at distances that are very large compared with the contact radius a . In Hertz theory , h ¼ N and d 2 is determined by a small - angle approximation , as illustrated in the inset . Biophysical Journal 101 ( 3 ) 643 – 650 644 Long et al . Hertz limit of an inﬁnite substrate . Later , we will show this is not the case , as the correction to Hertz theory in general depends on the ratios d / h and R / h . In the following , E in Eq . 1 will be replaced by E H , which we will call the Hertz modulus . Modiﬁed Hertz theory for a substrate of ﬁnite thickness based on linear elasticity We brieﬂy review previous works that sought to account for the effects of substrate thickness . Previous investigators modiﬁed Hertz theory to account for ﬁnite layer thickness either numerically ( 27 – 29 ) or analytically ( 21 , 30 ) . Shull and Crosby ( 27 ) and Shull ( 28 ) were primarily interested in probing the adhesion of gel to a micro - indenter , whereas Dimitriadis et al . ( 21 ) were interested in measuring the gel modulus using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . All of these works accounting for the ﬁnite layer thickness effect were based on linear elastic theory , where strains are assumed to be small ( d / h % 0 . 1 ) and directly proportional to stresses . Modiﬁed Hertz theory for a substrate of ﬁnite thickness based on nonlinear elasticity Small - strain theory breaks down when d / h R 0 . 1 , a condition that is frequently encountered in microsphere experiments ( 23 ) ( Table 1 ) , particu - larly during attempts to characterize soft biomaterial . Therefore , it is neces - sary to include large deformation in the analysis and to consider different values of R / h . The breakdown of small - strain theory creates two difﬁculties : The fact that displacements and strains are no longer small means that the relation between displacements and strains is nonlinear ( for example , the Lagrangian strain tensor involves quadratic terms of displacement gradients ) . Also , one must distinguish between the undeformed and deformed conﬁgurations . On top of these difﬁculties , one must account for material nonlinearity ( i . e . , Hooke’s law , which holds that strain is directly proportional to stress , is no longer accurate ) . In our ﬁnite - element simulations ( see below ) , the usual Hooke’s law of linear small - strain elas - ticity is replaced by a neo - Hookean solid ( 31 ) , the simplest material model used by physicists and chemists to extend Hooke’s law to account for large deformation . We also use the exact kinematics of large - deforma - tion theory ( 31 ) . To illustrate the nonlinearity brought about by large deformation and the neo - Hookean model , we consider a simple example of a straight bar with initial cross - section area A 0 and length L 0 subjected to a constant tension force T ( see inset of Fig . 2 ) . After deformation occurs , the cross - section area A 0 shrinks to A and the length extends to L . A plot of the normalized true stress s / E ( s ¼ T / A ) versus the extension ratio l ¼ L / L 0 ( solid line ) is shown in Fig . 2 . Recall that in small - strain theory , the tensile strain is 3 ¼ l (cid:2) 1 , and one does not draw a distinction between the true stress s and the nominal or engineering stress t ¼ T / A 0 . The linear small - strain theory , which holds that stress is directly proportional to strain , is shown as the dashed line in Fig . 2 . The prediction of the nonlinear neo - Hookean solid is shown as a solid line . Because the dash line is tangent to the solid line in Fig . 2 at l ¼ 1 ( 3 ¼ 0 ) , the neo - Hookean solid has the same Young’s modulus as the linear Hooke’s law in the limit of small strains . Clearly , deviation occurs once j 3 j > 0 . 2 , especially in compression ( l < 1 ) . It must be noted that the stress state in the gel layer under indentation is multi - axial and not uniform , and hence is much more complex than the example shown in Fig . 2 . We note that Yoffe ( 32 ) previously modiﬁed Hertz theory to account for large deformation . However , his analysis was based on perturbing the Hertz solution about the small - strain state , and did not account for the ﬁnite - thick - ness effect . Also , the constitutive model used in his analysis was the linear Hooke’s law , that is , it did not account for material nonlinearity . More recently , Lin and Chen ( 33 ) carried out a detailed large - deformation anal - ysis of the Hertz problem of a rigid hemisphere indenting on a neo - Hookean half - space ( i . e . , h ¼ N ) . They based their analysis on an exact formulation of the equations of nonlinear elasticity , but did not consider the ﬁnite - thick - ness effect . Finite - element method for modiﬁed Hertz theory We performed ﬁnite - element simulations using the commercial software ABAQUS ( 34 ) . We took advantage of the axisymmetry to create a two - dimensional , ﬁnite - element model for this indentation problem . The gel substrate was modeled as a circular layer made of incompressible neo - Hookean material . The radius of the layer was 20 h , where h is the thickness of the layer . The spherical indenter of radius R was modeled as a rigid object . ( We checked to ensure that increasing the radius of the layer had no effect on our solution . ) To highlight the effect of large deformation , we studied indentation depths up to d / h ¼ 0 . 6 , which clearly exceeds the limit of the small - strain theory . We considered two limits of the friction condition on the interface : the no - slip condition ( inﬁnite friction ) and the frictionless condition ( zero friction ) . We ascertained that our results obtained by the ﬁnite - element method ( FEM ) converged as the mesh size decreased . Additional information regarding the ﬁnite - element simulations is given in the Supporting Material . There are three dimensionless arguments that can be constructed in the indentation problem : the dimensionless force F = ð 16 E ﬃﬃﬃ R p d 3 = 2 = 9 Þ , the dimensionless indentation depth d = h , and the dimensionless indenter radius R / h . Dimensional analysis leads to the following result : 9 F 16 E ﬃﬃﬃ R p d 3 = 2 ¼ f (cid:3) d h ; R h (cid:4) ; or F ¼ 16 9 E ﬃﬃﬃ R p d 3 = 2 f (cid:3) d h ; R h (cid:4) : ( 4 ) TABLE 1 Results from the microsphere indentation experiments Gel thickness h ( m m ) Indentation depth d ( m m ) Dimensionless parameters Hertz modulus E H ( Pa ) Corrected modulus E ( Pa ) Linear modulus E L ( Pa ) R / h d / h u Sample 1 51 . 75 5 5 . 42 19 . 65 5 1 . 17 6 . 14 0 . 38 3 . 556 3226 5 288 . 1 312 5 85 . 6 359 5 92 . 5 Sample 2 153 . 27 5 15 . 37 41 . 05 5 1 . 59 2 . 07 0 . 27 0 . 413 1068 5 62 . 1 344 5 49 . 6 368 5 51 . 7 Sample 3 272 . 26 5 17 . 54 64 . 41 5 1 . 74 1 . 17 0 . 24 0 . 145 544 5 22 . 0 261 5 20 . 4 263 5 19 . 2 Sample 4 520 . 94 5 6 . 29 89 . 74 5 1 . 37 0 . 61 0 . 17 0 . 034 330 5 7 . 6 230 5 6 . 1 216 5 5 . 9 Sample 5 771 . 37 5 30 . 05 112 . 66 5 2 . 49 0 . 41 0 . 15 0 . 0147 235 5 7 . 8 188 5 6 . 9 172 5 6 . 8 Sample 6 1053 . 5 5 23 . 92 133 . 40 5 2 . 54 0 . 30 0 . 13 0 . 0075 182 5 5 . 2 158 5 4 . 6 143 5 4 . 5 Sample 7 133 . 75 5 2 . 26 31 . 36 5 1 . 37 4 . 37 0 . 23 1 . 039 1633 5 107 . 0 334 5 33 . 7 374 5 38 . 1 Gel thickness h and indentation depth d were measured in experiments using the microscopic indentation method . Samples 1 – 6 were indented by a steel ball of radius R ¼ 317 . 5 m m ( six measurements per sample ) . Sample 7 was indented by a glass sphere of radius R ¼ 585 m m ( 10 measurements ) . Averagevalues of dimensionless parameters R / h , d / h , and u are listed in the table . The Hertz modulus E H was calculated using Hertz theory ( Eq . 1 ) with n ¼ 1 / 2 . The corrected modulus E was determined using the correction factor ( Eq . 6 ) and the frictionless interface condition . The linear modulus E L was calculated using the correc - tion factor provided in Dimitriadis et al . ( 21 ) ( see their Eq . 12 ) . All of the data except for the dimensionless parameters are presented as the mean 5 SD .

Using Eqs . 1 and 4 , and Poisson ratio to be 0 . 5 , we ﬁnd the correc - tion factor j to be j ¼ E = E H ¼ (cid:5) f (cid:3) d h ; R h (cid:4)(cid:6) (cid:2) 1 ( 5 ) To investigate the effect of R / h on the correction factor j , we carried out ﬁnite - element simulations for different R / h values in the range of 0 . 5 – 12 . 7 , which covers the dimensions used in typical experiments . Experimental methods Coverslip activation The surface of glass coverslips ( No 1 , 48 mm (cid:3) 65 mm ; Thermo Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA ) were activated to covalently bond to polyacrylamide gel sheets via methods adapted from the protocol of Reinhart - King et al . ( 23 ) . First , a cotton swab was used to evenly coat the surface with 0 . 1 N NaOH , and the coverslip was air - dried . Second , a Pasteur pipette was used to coat the surfacewith 60 m lof 3 - aminopropyltrimethoxysilane ( APTMS ; Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . After incubation for 5 min , the coverslips were washed with distilled H2O and air - dried . Third , the coverslips were coated with 2 ml of 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( 70 % ; Aldrich ) in phosphate - buffered saline and incubated for 30 min . Finally , the slides were washed in distilled water and air - dried , which completed the surface activation . Polyacrylamide gel preparation Polyacrylamide gels of different thicknesses were cast and bound to the activated surface of the glass coverslips . A polyacrylamide mixture with a ﬁnal concentration of 3 % acrylamide ( 40 % w / v ; Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) , 0 . 1 % N , N - methylene - bis - acrylamide ( BIS , 2 % w / v ; Bio - Rad ) , 300 mM HEPES ( EMD Chemicals , Gibbstown , NJ ) , 0 . 05 % tetramethyle - thylenediamine ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , and 0 . 83 m m green ﬂuorescent microspheres ( catalog No . G830 ; Thermo Scientiﬁc ) at a concentration of 4 (cid:3) 10 6 / ml was prepared . The mixture was adjusted to a pH of 6 with hydrochloric acid and then degassed . Molecular biology - grade ethyl alcohol was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 7 % . Ammonium persulfate ( Aldrich ) was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 05 % w / v for initial poly - merization . Avolume of polyacrylamide solution depending on the desired gel thickness was pipetted onto the hydrophobic side of the circular glass coverslip . The activated side of the 48 mm (cid:3) 65 mm slide was lowered into contact with the polyacrylamide mixture until the mixture covered the entire area of the circular coverslip . The polyacrylamide layer and circular coverslip were suspended upside down to ensure that most ﬂuorescent beads would be at the gel - water interface in later experiments . The sandwiched gel was polymerized for 30 min in a biohood ( 16 % humidity ) or 100 % humidity environment for 2 h . The circular coverslip was then removed and the polyacrylamide gels were immersed in distilled water for at least 1 day to ensure complete hydration before measurements were obtained . Microsphere indentation method and gel thickness measurements Weusedapair offorcepstoplaceasphericalindenterontoapolyacrylamide gel covered by water , submerging both the gel and the indenter . Using bright - ﬁeld microscopy and the x - y translation stage of the microscope ( IX51 , Olympus America , Center Valley , PA ) , we brought the indenter to the center of the image . The microscope was then switched to the epiﬂuor - escent mode . Using the z - control knob , we identiﬁed the green ﬂuorescent bead that was nearest the center of the image and appeared to be at the inter - face of the gel and the indenter . We located the z - position of the ﬂuorescent bead of interest by manually sweeping the z - position of the stage and recording the z - position at which the image of the ﬂuorescent bead had the maximum light intensity . The light intensity was measured with the imaging software IPLab ( Biovision , Mountain View , CA ) in real time . The resolution of the measured z - position of the stage was 5 1 . 0 m m . A magnet ( for the steel sphere ) or a pipette ( for the glass sphere ) was used to gently remove the indenter . The new z - position of the ﬂuorescent bead was found in the same manner as described above . To ensure that the measured ﬂuorescent bead was at the air - gel interface , we checked to see whether the ﬂuorescent bead recovered to the undeformed gel - water inter - face upon removal of the indenter . All of the measurements were carried out using beads that were located both at the center of the indenter and at the gel - water interface . The difference of the z - position of the microscope stage with and without the indenter multiplied by 1 . 31 was taken as the maximum displacement d of the ﬂuorescent bead at the contact point . The factor 1 . 31 was introduced because the translation of the microscope stage was in air and the actual distance measured was in gel , and thus there was an optical index mismatch at the air - gel interface . We obtained this factor through a careful calibration using a known spacing ( an equivalent of a z - ruler ) immersed in water . We fabricated the z - ruler , a silicon wafer with channels of various depths , using photolithography , and calibrated it with a proﬁlo - meter ( Tencor P10 Proﬁlometer , Tencor , Milpitas , CA ) . We then took the gel thickness measurements near the indentation location by ﬁnding the z - position of the lowest and highest beads in the gel . The difference in z - position multiplied by 1 . 31 was taken as the gel thickness .

In the small - strain regime of d / h % 0 . 1 , Eqs . 6 , 7a , and 7b reproduce the correction factor based on linear elasticity theory from Dimitriadis et al . ( 21 ) ( see red dashed lines ) . In the parameter regime of d / h > 0 . 1 , Eq . 6 deviates from the result of linear elasticity theory due to the nonlin - earity and large deformation of the material . This discrep - ancy becomes more evident when R / h is greater or less than one . Of interest , for a parameter range of R / h > 2 and < 12 . 7 , the correction factor j depends only on a single dimension - less parameter , u h ( R d / h 2 ) 3 / 2 , and can be described by a simpler formula . This result is supported by the collapse of data for different R / h values shown in Fig . 4 A ( slip ) and Fig . 4 B ( no - slip ) . The correction factor j is found to be well approximated by : E = E H ¼ j ¼ 1 þ 2 : 3 u 1 þ 1 : 15 u 1 = 3 þ 9 : 5 u þ b (cid:4) u 2 : ( 8 ) The numerical factor b * is 4 . 212 if the indenter is in fric - tionless contact with the substrate ( slip ) , and 9 . 288 if the indenter cannot slip on the substrate ( no - slip ) . Typical values of u in experiments can range from 0 . 01 to 10 . The maximum relative error between Eq . 8 and the FEM results is ~ 8 % for all data points plotted on Fig . 4 . Comparison with microsphere indentation experiments To evaluate the accuracy of our correction factor j in Eq . 6 , we carried out microsphere indentation experiments to mea - sure the modulus of a polyacrylamide gel containing 3 % acrylamide and 0 . 1 % BIS - acrylamide using the microsphere method . A steel ball with a diameter of 635 m m or a glass sphere with a diameter of 1 . 17 mm was used as the micro - sphere indenter . The weight of the steel ball minus the buoy - ancy gives a force of ~ 8 . 9 m N , where we have taken the density of steel to be 7800 kg / m 3 and the density of the solution to be 1000 kg / m 3 . Similarly , the weight of the glass indenter is calculated to be 12 . 33 m N . We measured the indentation depths for seven gel samples with the same FIGURE 3 Correction factor E / E H versus d / h when R / h ¼ 0 . 5 or 1 , considering a frictionless interface between the indenter and the gel .

Biophysical Journal 101 ( 3 ) 643 – 650 Measuring Soft Gel Modulus Using a Microscope 647 composition but different thicknesses using the z - control of the microscope stage ( Olympus IX 51 ) . We found the contact point by ﬁnding the position of the ﬂuorescent bead located at the contact point . The data are summarized in Table 1 . Note that samples 1 – 6 were indented by the steel ball , whereas the glass sphere was used for sample 7 . For the data shown in Table 1 , we calculated the Young’s modulus E H directly using Hertz theory ( Eq . 1 ) . We found large discrepancies in E H for these samples with the same gel composition but different thicknesses , demonstrating the effect of ﬁnite thickness and the limitations of Hertz theory , especially for thin samples . We then corrected E H using the correction factor j given in Eq . 6 . Because the polyacrylamide gels used in the experiments contain > 90 % water , we expected a low interface friction , and hence the frictionless condition was assumed on the inter - face between the microsphere and the gel substrate . After this correction , the moduli for all samples were much closer to each other . The mean 5 standard deviation ( SD ) of the gel modulus is 249 5 75 Pa ( using samples 1 – 6 ) . One might notice that the SD in the corrected modulus decreases with increased sample thickness . This is because the indentation depth of the thin samples is much smaller than that of the thick samples , which makes the thin samples more sensitive to measurement errors in the indentation method . Also listed in Table 1 is the corrected modulus E L , which we obtained using a correction factor based on linear elas - ticity theory in Dimitriadis et al . ( 21 ) . Although this theory was speciﬁcally developed for AFM indentation and applies to the small - strain condition where d / h % 0 . 1 , and all our experiments were carried out when d / h R 0 . 1 , the correction factor from linear theory also shows signiﬁcant improve - ments from the Hertz theory . The consistency of the data ( characterized by the difference of the maximum and minimum of the modulus divided by the average modulus ) from the nonlinear elasticity theory is improved ~ 13 % in comparison with that of linear elasticity theory , assuming that the gels in all of the samples have the same Young’s modulus . To highlight the contrast between the uncorrected modulus E H and the corrected modulus E , we plot the re - sults of samples 1 – 6 as a function of gel thickness h in Fig . 5 A . A horizontal line at 249 Pa ( i . e . , the average cor - rected modulus ) is inserted into Fig . 5 A as a reference line . We also plot a dashed curve in Fig . 5 A that shows the results from Hertz theory . We obtained this curve by ﬁrst solving for d in Eq . 4 with E ¼ 249 Pa , F ¼ 8 . 9 m N , R ¼ 317 . 5 m m , and f replaced by j (cid:2) 1 ( j is given in Eq . 6 ) for different thicknesses h , and then substituting d in Eq . 1 to calculate E H . Note that this curve is in excellent agreement with E H obtained by direct measurement of d and using Eq . 1 ( circles in Fig . 5 ) . The dashed curve converges to the horizontal line ( at 249 Pa ) as the thickness increases , as is expected because Hertz theory becomes more accurate for thicker substrate . At h ¼ 1000 m m , Hertz theory still overestimates the gel modulus by 15 % . We emphasize that the validity of Hertz theory does not depend on the absolute value of the substrate thickness , h , but on the relative ratios , u h ( R d / h 2 ) 3 / 2 and R / h . To highlight the importance of measuring the gel modulus in situ , we present another set of data obtained using the same gel composition ( 3 % acrylamide and 0 . 1 % BIS - acryl - amide ) and protocol ( 23 ) , but with one different step in the polymerization procedure . Fig . 5 A shows the corrected modulus measurement of 249 Pa from a gel that was poly - merized under a 100 % humidity chamber for 2 h , and Fig . 5 B shows the result of 750 Pa from a gel that was poly - merized under a biohood with ~ 16 % humidity for 30 min . In an independent measurement of the gel modulus using a rheometer , Yeung et al . ( 35 ) obtained a modulus of 1000 Pa , which compares favorably with our measurement of 750 Pa FIGURE 5 Correcting the ﬁnite thickness effect in microsphere indenta - tion experiments . The circles are the E H value calculated using Hertz theory and the measured d . The squares are the corrected modulus E calculated using Eq . 6 and the measured d . Error bars represent the SD from six measurements . The solid lines indicate the average values of the corrected modulus : ( A ) 249 Pa and ( B ) 750 Pa . The dashed lines are guidelines for data points from Hertz theory . The solid level lines indicate that the gel modulus is independent of the gel thickness . Biophysical Journal 101 ( 3 ) 643 – 650 648 Long et al . obtained using the same gel - making protocol and polymer - ization on a bench with low humidity for 30 min . We also found that the gel modulus increases if the vacuum pressure used in the degassing step of the protocol is lower , possibly due to the increased polymer concentration as a result of evaporation . These results suggest that the gel modulus depends sensitively on every step of the protocol , and high - light the importance of measuring the gel modulus in situ when performing cell - related experiments . DISCUSSION Our FEM results show that the Young’s modulus E mea - sured in a microsphere indentation experiment is given by E ¼ E H j ð u ; R = h Þ ; u ¼ (cid:7) R d = h 2 (cid:8) 3 = 2 ; ( 9 ) where E H is the Hertz modulus given by Eq . 1 and j is the correction factor given by Eq . 6 . For our material model , we used the neo - Hookean model , which approaches Hooke’s law in the limit of small strains . It should be noted that the neo - Hookean model is accurate only for moderate strains . For very large deformations , this model may not accurately capture the nonlinear elastic behavior of a mate - rial . For example , it is well known the neo - Hookean model substantially underestimates the amount of strain hardening of elastomers and rubbers when the deformation is very large ( 36 ) . As a result , one should use caution when applying Eq . 6 for very large indentation depths ( e . g . , for d / h R 0 . 8 ) . In combination with the modiﬁed Hertz theory that accounts for ﬁnite gel thickness and large deformation effects , the microsphere indentation method offers an alter - native way to accurately measure the modulus of soft gels in situ without the need for expensive equipment such as an atomic force microscope or rheometer . Here we comment on assumption 4 ( see above ) of the Hertz theory . Adhesion increases the contact area predicted by the Hertz model . Adhesive interactions of gels and elas - tomers with hard surfaces are typically governed by disper - sive forces . The thermodynamic work of adhesion , W , on these surfaces is quite low , on the order of 40 – 80 mJ / m 2 ; nevertheless , their effect on contact mechanics can be important , particularly when the indentation depth is small . Indeed , overestimation of E at shallow indentation depth is often attributed to surface interaction between the indenter and the substrate in an indentation test ( 22 ) . One can quantify the effect of adhesion by using the Johnson - Kendall - Roberts ( JKR ) theory ( 37 ) . We include this result in the Supporting Material because it is not directly relevant to this work . One might notice in Table 1 that there is a systematic decrease in the modulus value with the increase of sample thickness . In theory , the modulus should be independent of sample thickness after correction . This result may indi - cate that the gels in the thicker samples were softer than those in the thinner ones . In early experiments , we found that it took a longer time for thicker samples to fully poly - merize compared with the thin samples . To ensure that the thick samples were fully polymerized , we developed a new ( to our knowledge ) polymerization procedure in which the samples were placed under a 100 % humidity condition for 2 h , in contrast to the usual 30 min polymerization time on a bench top used in recent studies ( 35 ) . Samples of all thicknesses shown in Table 1 were prepared using the same procedure . Finally , we would like to emphasize the importance of in situ gel characterization , because the gel modulus depends sensitively on detailed gel preparation steps , including the humidity , degassing vacuum pressure , and duration of polymerization . In the future , we would like to extend this method to measure the modulus of a cell - embedded bio - matrix layer and probe the process of cellular biomatrix remodeling in real time .
