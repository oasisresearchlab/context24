Juvenile brains typically show higher spine density and turnover compared to adult brains , potentially enabling greater capacity for experience - dependent circuit ‘rewiring’ . Although spine pruning and stabilization in frontal cortex overlap with pubertal milestones , it is unclear if gonadal hormones A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 2 drive these processes . To address this question , we used hormone manipulations and in vivo 2 - photon microscopy to test for a causal relationship between pubertal hormones and spine pruning and stabilization in layer 5 neurons in the frontal cortex of female mice . We found that spine density , gains , and losses decreased from P27 to P60 and that these measures were not affected by pre - pubertal hormone injections or ovariectomy . Further analyses of spine morphology after manipulation of gonadal hormones suggest that gonadal hormones may play a role in morphological maturation and dynamics . Our data help to segregate hormone - sensitive and hormone - insensitive maturational processes that occur simultaneously in dorsomedial frontal cortex . These data provide more specific insight into adolescent development and may have implications for understanding the neurodevelopmental effects of changes in pubertal timing in humans .

Introduction As the site of most excitatory synapses and some inhibitory and modulatory synapses , dendritic spines are critical mediators of information processing by cortical pyramidal cells ( DeFelipe and Farinas , 1992 ; Holtmaat and Svoboda , 2009 ; Spruston , 2008 ) . Dendritic spines can be dynamic , with spines being both gained and lost during development ( Holtmaat et al . , 2005 ; Johnson et al . , 2016a ; Zuo et al . , 2005a ) and as a result of experience ( Fu et al . , 2012 ; Munoz - Cuevas et al . , 2013 ; Xu et al . , 2009 ; Yang et al . , 2009 ) . Although new and transient spines do not always contain synapses , spine gain and loss are thought to reflect the sampling of new potential synaptic partners and enable the remodeling of connectivity ( Berry and Nedivi , 2017 ; Holtmaat et al . , 2005 ; Trachtenberg et al . , 2002 ; Zito et al . , 2009 ) , particularly in response to learning ( Fu et al . , 2012 ; Hayashi - Takagi et al . , 2015 ; Lai et al . , 2012 ; Munoz - Cuevas et al . , 2013 ; Roberts et al . , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2009 ; Yang et al . , 2009 ) . Changes in individual spine morphology A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 3 are also known to occur with maturation of a new synapse and over development ( Berry and Nedivi , 2017 ) . Spines in the frontal cortex , as well as other cortical regions , are pruned during adolescence in a variety of species , including humans ( Petanjek et al . , 2011 ) , rats ( Koss et al . , 2014 ) , and mice ( Holtmaat et al . , 2005 ; Johnson et al . , 2016a ) . In vivo imaging studies in mice using fluorescently labeled neurons have shown that spines are not only pruned , but also stabilized across adolescence : The fraction of total spines gained and lost per day declines during adolescence , leaving behind a more stable population as animals progress into adulthood ( Holtmaat et al . , 2005 ; Johnson et al . , 2016a ; Zuo et al . , 2005a ) . Spine pruning and stabilization during adolescence may be associated with a reduction in the capacity for flexible learning and reorganization of neural connectivity . The best evidence for this comes from adolescent zebra finches , in which greater baseline spine turnover predicts greater capacity for flexible song learning ( Roberts et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , the stabilization of spines across adolescence may relate critically to developmental shifts in the capacity for plasticity and learning . Given the links between spine dynamics and learning , it is of great interest to understand the mechanisms driving the pruning and stabilization of dendritic spines during adolescence . We have previously hypothesized that exposure to gonadal steroids during puberty may decrease capacity for plasticity and circuit remodeling in frontal cortex ( Piekarski et al . , 2017b ) , which may be mediated , in part , by reduced spine turnover . Correlational evidence in humans and mice supports this possibility : The onset of spine pruning in human frontal cortex coincides with the average age at puberty onset ( Petanjek et al . , 2011 ) , and measures of cortical thinning in human structural MRI data correlate with pubertal development ( Herting et al . , 2015 ; Herting et al . , 2014 ; Peper et al . , 2009 ) . Spine pruning and stabilization in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in mouse frontal cortex also occur during pubertal development ( Johnson et al . , 2016a ) , sex - specific changes in cortical synapse density occur during adolescence in rats ( Drzewiecki et al . , 2016 ) , and hormone A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 4 treatment can alter spine density and turnover in cortical pyramidal cells of adult mice ( Tan et al . , 2012 ; Wang et al . , 2017 ) . Although these data suggest a potential role for pubertal hormones in the maturation of spine dynamics , establishing a causal relationship requires experimental manipulation of gonadal hormone exposure during adolescence . It is therefore still unknown whether pubertal hormones influence the maturation of spine dynamics during adolescence . The role of pubertal hormones in brain maturation is particularly important in light of recent advancement in the age of puberty onset in girls and boys ( Herman - Giddens , 2006 ) and the negative educational and mental health outcomes associated with early - onset puberty in girls ( Graber , 2013 ) . We have previously shown that in female mice , pubertal hormones drive maturation of inhibitory neurotransmission in layer 2 / 3 of the dorsomedial frontal cortex ( Piekarski et al . , 2017a ) , a region implicated in a variety of cognitive and affective behaviors in rodents and humans ( Blakemore and Robbins , 2012 ; Felix - Ortiz et al . , 2016 ; Johnson and Wilbrecht , 2011 ) . However , it is unknown whether pubertal hormones drive other aspects of frontal circuit maturation , such as spine pruning and stabilization , or maturation of average spine morphology . Revealing which aspects of frontal circuit maturation are hormone - dependent and which are not is critical for understanding normative adolescent development and the implications of the advancing age of puberty onset in humans . Here , we show the results of in vivo 2 - photon microscopy experiments designed to test the role of pubertal hormones in the maturation of spine density and turnover on layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the female mouse frontal cortex . The experiments were initially designed to answer three questions : 1 ) Do female mice show spine pruning and stabilization in the dorsomedial frontal cortex across adolescence , as has been shown in males ( Johnson et al . , 2016a ) ; 2 ) Does pre - pubertal hormone exposure induce an early reduction in spine density and turnover ; and 3 ) Are gonadal hormones necessary for the maturation of spine density and turnover across adolescence . We found that females , like males , show spine stabilization and pruning across adolescence on layer 5 pyramidal cells in frontal cortex , but these processes are unaffected by A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 5 pre - pubertal hormone exposure or gonadectomy . These negative data led us to pursue opportunistic follow - up analyses of the morphology of spines to ask , 4 ) Does pre - pubertal hormone treatment or gonadectomy alter the maturation of spine morphology across adolescence and / or morphological dynamics over 24 hours ? In these analyses , we did find subtle but significant effects that suggest ovarian hormones do contribute to the morphological maturation of dendritic spines on layer V neurons and the dynamic remodeling of their morphology during early adulthood . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 . Animals Female C57BL / 6J mice from the Thy - 1 - YFP - H line ( Jackson Laboratory , Bar Harbor , Maine ) , in which a subset of layer 5 pyramidal cells is fluorescently labeled ( Feng et al . , 2000 ; Porrero et al . , 2010 ) , were bred in our animal facility . We chose to use females in this study due to public health issues surrounding the advancing age of puberty in girls ( Graber , 2013 ; Herman - Giddens , 2006 ) , and based on previous data showing that pubertal hormones in females drive maturation of inhibitory neurotransmission in the dorsomedial region of frontal cortex imaged in this study ( Piekarski et al . , 2017a ) . All mice were weaned on postnatal day ( P ) 21 and housed in groups of 2 - 3 same - sex siblings on a 12 : 12hr reverse light : dark cycle ( lights on at 10PM ) . All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California , Berkeley and conformed to principles enunciated in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . 2 . 2 . Pre - pubertal hormone exposure to induce early - onset puberty To advance age at puberty onset , gonadally intact females were injected with 17 beta - estradiol benzoate ( 0 . 01mg / kg subcutaneous ) at P24 and progesterone ( 20mg / kg subcutaneous ) at P26 ( Fig . 1 ; ( Piekarski et al . , 2017a ) ) . This treatment advances first peripubertal exposure to gonadal steroids and is sufficient to induce endogenous puberty ( Ramirez and Sawyer , 1965 ; Smith and Davidson , 1968 ) . A vehicle control group was injected with equivalent volumes of oil vehicle at P24 and P26 . A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 6 2 . 3 . Ovariectomy To eliminate gonadal hormone exposure during puberty , ovariectomies were performed before puberty onset ( P24 or P25 ) . Mice were injected with 0 . 05mg / kg buprenorphine and 10mg / kg meloxicam subcutaneously before surgery and were anesthetized with 1 - 2 % isoflurane during surgery . The incision area was shaved and scrubbed with ethanol and betadine . Ophthalmic ointment was placed over the eyes to prevent drying . A 1 cm incision was made with a scalpel in the lower abdomen across the midline to access the abdominal cavity . The ovaries were clamped off from the uterine horn with locking forceps and ligated with sterile sutures . After ligation , ovaries were excised with a scalpel . The muscle and skin layers were then sutured , and wound clips were placed over the incision for 7 - 10 days to allow the incision to heal . An additional injection of 10mg / kg meloxicam was given 12 - 24 hours after surgery . Sham control surgeries were identical to ovariectomies except that the ovaries were simply visualized and were not clamped , ligated or excised . Mice were allowed to recover on a heating pad until ambulatory and were post - surgically monitored for 7 - 10 days to check for normal weight gain and signs of discomfort / distress . 2 . 4 . Cranial window surgery Cranial window surgeries were performed in YFP - H mice at P26 or in young adulthood ( age range P54 - P63 ) . Detailed surgical procedures have been described previously ( Holtmaat et al . , 2009 ) . Briefly , mice were anesthetized with isoflurane anesthesia . A craniotomy ( diameter 2 . 5mm ) was made over the dorsomedial frontal cortex , centered over the midline , with the caudal edge of the craniotomy at bregma . The dura was left intact during this procedure . The craniotomy was covered with a thin layer of agarose solution ( 0 . 7 % in ACSF ) and sealed with a glass coverslip . Mice were given subcutaneous injections of meloxicam ( 10mg / kg ) during surgery and 24 hours after surgery . 2 . 5 . Dendritic spine imaging After 1 day of recovery from cranial window surgery , mice were imaged once per day for 2 consecutive days . We chose a 24 - hour interval between imaging sessions based on our previous data A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 7 showing differences in spine density and turnover between pre - and post - pubertal male mice using this same imaging interval ( Johnson et al . , 2016a ) . Imaging took place at P27 and P28 for vehicle - and hormone - treated mice and between P55 and P65 for ovariectomized ( OVX ) and sham mice . Rapid bone growth from the rostral midline in young animals makes longer recovery times infeasible for imaging of structures close to the midline in frontal cortex . Previous data from our laboratory show no difference in spine turnover depending on the length of recovery time from cranial window surgery in this brain region ( Munoz - Cuevas et al . , 2013 ) . Detailed in vivo imaging procedures have been described previously ( Holtmaat et al . , 2009 ) . Briefly , the apical dendrites of YFP - expressing pyramidal cells ( layer 5 ) were imaged using a Mai Tai HP laser ( 950nm , Spectra Physics , Santa Clara , CA ) , Ultima IV in vivo laser - scanning microscope ( Bruker , Middleton , WI ) , and a 40x 0 . 8N objective ( Olympus , Center Valley , PA ) . Segments of dendrite ( each ~ 40  m in length ) located within 100  m of the surface ( i . e . in layer 1 ) were imaged at a resolution of 0 . 08  m / pixel using a z - step size of 1  m . Imaged dendrite segments were less than 0 . 8mm from the midline in both the right and left hemispheres , anterior to bregma ( 0 to 2 . 5mm from bregma ) . Multiple cells were sampled in each mouse . 2 . 6 . Image processing and analysis Images were analyzed blind to the mouse’s experimental group . Images used for analysis were median - filtered 3 - dimensional z stacks . Dendritic spines were scored according to established criteria ( Holtmaat et al . , 2009 ) using custom Matlab software ( Mathworks , Natick , MA ) . Dendritic spines were scored if they protruded laterally more than 0 . 4  m from the dendritic shaft . To calculate spine density , the total number of spines for each mouse was divided by the total length of analyzed dendrite in  m . To calculate the fraction of spines gained for each mouse , the number of new spines present on the second day of imaging ( P28 ) was divided by the total number of spines present on the first day of imaging ( P27 ) . A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 8 To calculate the fraction of spines lost , the number of spines lost between the first and second day of imaging was divided by the total number of spines present on the first day of imaging ( P27 ) . Based on previous studies showing that spine brightness is proportional to spine volume ( Holtmaat et al . , 2005 ) , we used spine head brightness as a proxy for the relative size of spine heads ( Cane et al . , 2014 ) . Brightness quantification was performed in ImageJ . A 5 by 5 - pixel square ( pixel size 0 . 08  m ) was placed over the spine head , and brightness was calculated as the summed intensity of pixels within the square . To control for differences in fluorophore expression level , spine head brightness was normalized to ( i . e . divided by ) the brightness of the adjacent dendritic shaft . The brightness of the adjacent shaft was measured as the summed intensity of pixels in a 5 by 5 - pixel square placed on the dendritic shaft at the base of each spine . Background brightness , i . e . the summed intensity of pixels in a 5 by 5 - pixel square placed over the adjacent background , was subtracted from all shaft and spine measures . Spine length was calculated as the Euclidean distance from the base of the spine to the tip of the spine head . For image presentation ( Fig . 2A ) , the relevant sections of dendrite were projected onto a 2 - dimensional image , which was then Gaussian filtered and contrasted for presentation . To project the relevant sections of dendrite onto a 2 - dimensional image , the frames from the 3 - dimensional z stack in which spines were most clearly in focus were combined using the maximum or average intensity z projection functions in ImageJ . In one case , this 3D image flattening method caused a failure to display one spine that was scored as present during both imaging sessions but was not in focus in the same frames in which other spines were in focus . All spine gains and losses are faithfully represented and marked by yellow triangles in the z - projected images shown in Fig . 2A . 2 . 7 . Statistical tests We analyzed 132 + / - 4 . 42 ( mean + / - SEM ) spines per mouse . For Fig . 2 , we calculated a single value for density , fraction of spines gained , and fraction of spines lost for each mouse , such that N for A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 9 analysis was the number of mice . For Fig . 3 ( analysis of spine brightness and length ) , spines were considered individually , such that N for analysis was the number of spines . All statistical comparisons were performed using GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad , San Diego , CA ) . Data were tested for normality using a D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test and were tested for equal variance using a Brown - Forsythe test . Data that were normally distributed and had equal variance were analyzed using a 1 - way ANOVA with Sidak’s corrections for multiple comparisons . Data that were not normally distributed were analyzed using a Kruskal Wallis test with Dunn’s corrections for multiple comparisons . For all analyses of group differences ( Fig . 2 , Fig . 3A - G ) , 3 post - hoc comparisons were performed : P27 vehicle to P60 sham , P27 vehicle to P27 hormone , and P60 sham to P60 OVX . For analyses of differences between persistent and dynamic spines ( Fig . 3H - I ) , 2 post - hoc comparisons were performed : session 1 persistent vs session 1 lost , and session 2 persistent vs session 2 gained . 3 . Results To test whether pubertal hormones drive maturation of spine dynamics across adolescence , we used in vivo 2 - photon microscopy to follow individual dendrites across two consecutive days in the dorsomedial frontal cortex of female mice . Treatment groups included a vehicle - treated pre - pubertal group ( P27 vehicle ; Fig . 1 ) , an age - matched hormone - treated group that experienced early - onset puberty ( P27 hormone ; Fig . 1 ) , a P60 group that went through puberty naturally ( P60 sham ; Fig . 1 ) , and a P60 group that was ovariectomized before puberty and was therefore not exposed to gonadal hormones during adolescence ( P60 OVX ; Fig . 1 ) . All imaged mice were from the YFP - H line , which labels a subset of layer 5 pyramidal cells ( Feng et al . , 2000 ; Porrero et al . , 2010 ) . Imaged dendrites were apical dendrites located in layer 1 of dorsomedial frontal cortex , less than 0 . 8mm from the midline in both the right and left hemispheres ( Fig . 1 ; Fig . 2A ) . We found that the 4 treatment groups differed in spine density ( Fig . 2B ; F 3 , 36 = 6 . 99 , p = 0 . 0008 ) , spine gains ( Fig . 2C ; F 3 , 36 = 9 . 55 , p < 0 . 0001 ) , and spine losses ( Fig . 2D ; H = 23 . 66 , A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 10 p < 0 . 0001 ) . To determine whether female mice show spine pruning and stabilization in dorsomedial frontal cortex across adolescence , we compared P27 vehicle - treated mice to P60 sham mice . We hypothesized that these hormonally unmanipulated female mice would show lower spine density and turnover at P60 compared to P27 , as previously observed in male mice ( Johnson et al . , 2016a ) . In accordance with our hypothesis , P60 sham mice showed lower spine density ( Fig . 2B ; Sidak’s adjusted p = 0 . 015 ) , lower spine gains ( Fig . 2C ; Sidak’s adjusted p = 0 . 0068 ) , and lower spine losses ( Fig . 2D ; Dunn’s adjusted p = 0 . 0021 ) compared to P27 vehicle - treated mice . To test whether early - onset puberty can induce precocious maturation of spine dynamics , we compared P27 vehicle - treated mice to P27 mice that underwent hormone treatment to induce early - onset puberty ( Fig . 1 ; ( Piekarski et al . , 2017a ; Ramirez and Sawyer , 1965 ; Smith and Davidson , 1968 ) ) . We hypothesized that hormone treatment would induce a precocious reduction in spine density and turnover in P27 mice . Contrary to our hypothesis , hormone - treated mice did not differ from vehicle - treated mice in spine density ( Fig . 2B ; Sidak’s adjusted p > 0 . 99 ) , gains ( Fig . 2C ; Sidak’s adjusted p = 0 . 99 ) , or losses ( Fig . 2A ; Dunn’s adjusted p > 0 . 99 ) . To determine whether gonadal hormone exposure during puberty was necessary for the adolescent reduction in spine density and turnover , we compared mice that were ovariectomized before puberty to gonadally intact sham controls that were imaged post - pubertally . We hypothesized that pre - pubertal gonadectomy would prevent the adolescent decrease in spine density and turnover . Contrary to our hypothesis , P60 OVX mice did not differ from P60 sham mice in spine density ( Fig . 2B ; Sidak’s adjusted p = 0 . 98 ) , gains ( Fig . 2C ; Sidak’s adjusted p = 0 . 68 ) , or losses ( Fig . 2D ; Dunn’s adjusted p > 0 . 99 ) . These results indicate that spine pruning and stabilization occur across adolescence in the dorsomedial frontal cortex of female mice , and that in the layer 5 neurons investigated here , these processes do not depend on gonadal hormone exposure during puberty . A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 11 To determine whether spine morphologies differed based on age and hormonal status , we quantified the length and spine head brightness of all analyzed spines . Spine head brightness was used as a proxy for spine head size based on previous data showing that brightness correlates with spine volume ( Cane et al . , 2014 ; Holtmaat et al . , 2005 ) . Spine head brightness differed among the groups ( Fig . 3A ; H = 26 . 32 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . P60 sham mice showed brighter , i . e . larger , spine heads compared to P27 vehicle - treated mice ( Dunn’s corrected p < 0 . 0001 ) , suggesting that spine head size increases across adolescence in mice undergoing natural puberty . Hormone treatment did not alter spine head brightness in P27 mice ( Dunn’s adjusted p > 0 . 99 ) , but P60 OVX mice showed dimmer spine heads compared to P60 sham mice ( Dunn’s adjusted p = 0 . 0498 ) , suggesting that pubertal hormones contribute to the increase in spine head size across adolescence . Spine length decreased across adolescence in hormonally unmanipulated mice ( Fig . 3B ; H = 38 . 74 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Dunn’s adjusted p < 0 . 0001 for P27 vehicle vs P60 sham ) . P27 hormone - treated mice showed a trend toward shorter spine length compared to P27 vehicle - treated mice ( Dunn’s adjusted p = 0 . 05 ) , but spine length did not differ between P60 OVX and P60 sham mice ( Dunn’s adjusted p = 0 . 89 ) . Spine head brightness ( i . e . size ) to spine length ratio , a measure of spines’ morphological maturity ( reviewed in ( Berry and Nedivi , 2017 ) ) , differed among the groups ( Fig . 3C ; H = 51 . 4 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . P60 sham mice showed greater brightness to length ratio compared to P27 vehicle - treated mice ( Dunn’s adjusted p < 0 . 0001 ) , suggesting that spines develop more mature morphologies across adolescence in mice undergoing natural puberty . Hormone treatment subtly , but significantly , increased brightness to length ratio in P27 mice ( Dunn’s adjusted p = 0 . 04 ) , while a comparison of P60 sham to P60 OVX mice did not reach significance after correcting for multiple comparisons ( Dunn’s adjusted p = 0 . 15 ) . These results suggest that 1 ) spine morphology matures across adolescence , with spine head brightness ( i . e . size ) increasing and spine length decreasing , and 2 ) that gonadal hormones may contribute to this morphological maturation . A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 12 For spines that persisted across both imaging days , we measured the change in spine head brightness and spine length from day 1 to day 2 . Changes in brightness and length were considered as absolute values , in which both growth and retraction events were counted as positive numbers ( Fig . 3D , F ) , and as net change , in which growth events were counted as positive and retraction events as negative ( Fig . 3E , G ) . Absolute change in spine head brightness differed among the groups ( Fig . 3D ; H = 45 . 69 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . A comparison of P27 vehicle to P60 sham mice did not reach significance ( Dunn’s adjusted p = 0 . 21 ) , but P60 OVX mice showed less change in spine head brightness compared to P60 sham mice ( Dunn’s adjusted p = 0 . 0009 ) , suggesting that gonadal hormones may support day - to - day changes in spine head size in adult mice . Net change in spine head brightness was close to zero in all groups , suggesting that spine head growth was largely balanced by spine head shrinkage , but differed slightly between P27 vehicle and P60 sham animals ( Fig . 3E ; H = 13 . 09 , p = 0 . 0045 ; Dunn’s adjusted p = 0 . 0495 for P27 vehicle vs P60 sham ) . Absolute change in spine length also differed among the groups ( Fig . 3F ; H = 127 . 6 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . P60 sham animals showed less change in spine length compared to P27 vehicle - treated animals ( Dunn’s adjusted p < 0 . 0001 ) , suggesting that spine growth and retraction events decrease across adolescence in mice undergoing natural puberty . However , P60 OVX animals showed less change in spine length compared to P60 sham animals ( Dunn’s adjusted p = 0 . 0007 ) , suggesting that gonadal hormones in adulthood may support day - to - day changes in spine length . Net change in spine length did not differ among the groups ( Fig . 3G ; H = 2 . 14 , p = 0 . 54 ) . When persistent spines were compared to those that were gained or lost , persistent spines showed dramatically greater brightness to length ratios , i . e . more mature spine morphology , compared to spines that were gained or lost ( Fig . 3H - I ; H = 416 . 8 , p < 0 . 0001 for P27 mice ; H = 169 . 7 , p < 0 . 0001 for P60 mice ; Dunn’s adjusted p < 0 . 0001 for all comparisons of persistent to gained or lost spines ) . This result indicates that spine turnover events were dominated by spines with immature morphologies in both age groups ( Fig . 3H - I ) , despite the fact that P60 spines on average showed more mature morphologies than P27 spines ( Fig . 3A - C ) . A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 13 4 . Discussion Our results indicate that , as we might predict from males , female mice show pruning and stabilization of spines on layer 5 pyramidal cells in the dorsomedial frontal cortex , as indicated by greater spine density , gains , and losses in pre - pubertal P27 mice compared to post - pubertal P60 mice ( Fig . 2B - D ) . Our manipulations of ovarian hormones suggest that gonadal hormones during puberty do not regulate these processes of spine pruning and stabilization : Pre - pubertal gonadal hormone exposure did not accelerate spine pruning and stabilization in P27 mice , and pre - pubertal gonadectomy did not alter spine density or turnover in mice imaged at P60 ( Fig . 2B - D ) . However , our exploratory analyses of spine morphology suggest that pubertal hormones may contribute to the maturation of spine morphology across adolescence , with pre - pubertal OVX reducing spine head brightness ( i . e . size ) in adulthood ( Fig . 3A ) and pre - pubertal hormone treatment driving a slight increase in measures of morphological maturity in P27 mice ( Fig . 3B - C ) . Furthermore , pre - pubertal OVX reduced day - to - day changes in both spine head brightness and spine length ( Fig . 3D , F ) , suggesting that gonadal hormones may support morphological remodeling of persistent spines in adult female mice . Thus , although gonadal hormones do not drive the reduction in frontal cortex spine density and turnover across adolescence , gonadal hormones may alter spine morphology in subtler ways during both adolescence and adulthood . Dendritic spines are critical for the integration of excitatory and inhibitory inputs on cortical pyramidal cells ( Spruston , 2008 ) , and their stabilization across adolescence may relate to changes in the capacity for experience - dependent circuit remodeling and flexible learning ( Roberts et al . , 2010 ) and / or the consolidation of learned associations ( Johnson et al . , 2016a ; Johnson et al . , 2016b ; Lai et al . , 2012 ; Munoz - Cuevas et al . , 2013 ) . The process of spine stabilization across adolescence may therefore be fundamental to the maturation of circuit dynamics and behavior , and our results suggest that this process can proceed on layer 5 pyramidal cells in the absence of pubertal exposure to gonadal hormones . A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 14 Although the lack of hormone effects on spine density and turnover in our data is unambiguous , one limitation of this experiment is that we sampled from only two timepoints : one pre - pubertal age ( P27 ) and one post - pubertal age ( P60 ) . For hormone - and vehicle - treated mice , we chose to assay spine density and turnover at P27 - 28 based on our previous results showing that the same hormone treatment protocol alters inhibitory neurotransmission in L2 / 3 of frontal cortex at P27 - 28 ( Piekarski et al . , 2017a ) . However , it is possible that pre - pubertal hormone exposure may influence the maturation of spine density and turnover over a more protracted time course , with effects that accumulate to a detectable level at later ages . Future studies may include hormone - and vehicle - treated groups sampled at older ages . Similarly , while we did not observe effects of OVX in mice imaged at P60 , it is possible that OVX altered the timing or pace of spine pruning and stabilization across adolescence , but that the OVX and sham groups converged by P60 . To test this possibility , future studies may include OVX and sham groups imaged during adolescence . A second limitation of the present study is that in the YFP - H mouse line we used for spine imaging , only a subset of layer 5 neurons is labeled ( Feng et al . , 2000 ; Porrero et al . , 2010 ) . While this sparse labeling is necessary for following individual spines from one day to the next , it is possible that pubertal hormones alter spine dynamics in cell types we did not image . In layer 5 of the frontal cortex , pyramidal cells can be separated into those that project to the pyramidal tract ( PT - type ) and those that project elsewhere within the cortex ( intra - telencephalic projecting , i . e . IT - type ) ( Porrero et al . , 2010 ) . In YFP - H mice , YFP - expressing cells are primarily PT - type ( Porrero et al . , 2010 ) , and less is known about the adolescent maturation of IT - type cells . However , there are data suggesting that YFP - negative , IT - type neurons mature differently than YFP - positive , PT - type neurons . In YFP - H mice , miniature excitatory and inhibitory currents ( mPSCs ) are stable from P25 to P40 on YFP - expressing cells , while neighboring YFP - negative ( IT - type ) cells show an increase in miniature inhibitory current ( mIPSC ) amplitude ( Vandenberg et al . , 2015 ) . Maturation of mIPSC amplitude onto these YFP - negative layer 5 cells is dependent A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 15 on TrkB signaling ( Vandenberg et al . , 2015 ) . TrkB signaling , in turn , could be regulated by gonadal hormone effects on brain derive neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) in both male and female rodents ( Carbone and Handa , 2013 ) . Thus , although gonadal hormones do not regulate the pruning and stabilization of spines on the YFP - expressing ( PT - type ) neurons assayed in our current study , future work in IT - type layer 5 cells may reveal gonadal hormone effects on the adolescent pruning and stabilization of spines . Layer 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons may also differ from layer 5 subtypes and merit independent investigation . Cells in layer 2 / 3 and layer 5 of the cortex are generated at different times ( Frantz and McConnell , 1996 ; Rakic , 1988 ) , and likely also develop differently . We have recently found that gonadal hormones are critical for an increase in miniature inhibitory current frequency and an increase in probability of GABA release onto layer 2 / 3 neurons in frontal cortex during puberty ( with no effects on current amplitude ) , and prepubertal hormone injections also decrease tonic inhibitory current in these same layer 2 / 3 cells ( Piekarski et al . , 2017a ) . In follow - up experiments , it will be critical to test if hormonal manipulation alters the density and turnover of dendritic spines in layer 2 / 3 neurons and layer 5 IT - type neurons , both of which are harder to access using standard Thy - 1 based in vivo imaging methods . If hormones do not play a role in the pruning and stabilization of dendritic spines on layer 5 neurons , then what factors drive these processes ? Age , neural activity , and stress hormones can be linked to changes in intracellular proteins ( Gray et al . , 2006 ; Hamilton et al . , 2017 ; Liston et al . , 2013 ) and cell - cell adhesion molecules ( Kwon et al . , 2012 ) that may play a regulatory role in spine maturation . Experience itself ( or the lack of experience ) may also drive the stabilization of synapses and serve to regulate plasticity ( Johnson et al . , 2016b ; Panchanathan and Frankenhuis , 2016 ; Roberts et al . , 2010 ; Wilbrecht et al . , 2010 ; Wilbrecht et al . , 2006 ; Zuo et al . , 2005b ) . Collectively , the present layer 5 spine data and previously published data on inhibitory neurotransmission onto layer 2 / 3 pyramidal cells ( Piekarski et al . , 2017a ) illustrate that some A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Boivin et al . , 16 aspects of frontal circuit maturation rely on gonadal hormones , while others do not . Thus , individual differences in the timing of puberty could result in differences in the relative timing of hormone - dependent and hormone - independent maturational processes . In recent decades , the average age at puberty onset has advanced , particularly in girls , and early - onset puberty is associated with negative mental health outcomes in girls ( Herman - Giddens , 2006 ) . We speculate that differences in the relative timing of maturation of different layers or circuits in the frontal cortex could play a role in the negative mental health outcomes associated with early - onset puberty in girls ( Graber , 2013 ) . It is also possible that extrinsic manipulation of pubertal hormones through contraceptive use and gender - affirming hormone treatment may have neurodevelopmental implications that should be clarified through further research . 5 . Conclusions The pruning and stabilization of dendritic spines across adolescence occur in a variety of cortical regions and may relate to shifts in the capacity for experience - dependent circuit remodeling and flexible learning . Here , we show that on a subset of layer 5 pyramidal cells in the dorsomedial frontal cortex , the pruning and stabilization of spines measured at two timepoints occur in a gonadal hormone - independent manner . This work contrasts with our recent studies showing that pubertal hormones drive maturation of inhibitory neurotransmission in layer 2 / 3 of this same brain region ( Piekarski et al . , 2017a ) . Our results suggest that multiple maturational processes occur in the frontal cortex during adolescence and are independently controlled via distinct mechanisms , with some systems relying on gonadal hormone exposure and others maturing in a gonadal hormone - independent manner . The timing of pubertal hormone exposure may therefore alter the sequence or phase relationships among these maturational processes , indicating a need for further research on the neurodevelopmental implications of the advancing age of puberty onset and the use of gonadal hormone treatments in youth .

To model early puberty , intact female mice were injected with estradiol ( E ) at P24 and progesterone ( P ) at P26 ( N = 12 mice ) , while controls were injected with vehicle at both ages ( N = 12 mice ) . To prevent pubertal exposure to gonadal hormones , female mice were ovariectomized ( OVX ) or received sham surgery at P24 ( N = 8 OVX mice ; N = 8 sham mice ) . On the timelines , solid lines indicate exposure to pubertal gonadal hormones , while dashed lines indicate pre - pubertal status or absence of gonads . A cranial window was placed over the dorsomedial frontal cortex anterior to bregma as shown in the schematic . The inset is a photograph of a representative window taken at the end of cranial window surgery . The diameter of the craniotomy is 2 . 5mm . Apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal cells were imaged in layer 1 of dorsomedial frontal cortex at P27 - P28 in vehicle - and hormone - treated mice and in young adulthood ( age range P55 - 65 , labeled as P60 ) in OVX and sham mice .
