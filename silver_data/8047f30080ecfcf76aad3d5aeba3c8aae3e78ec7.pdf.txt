Epidemic spreading under game - based self - quarantine behaviors guided by local and global infection information Zegang Huang , 1 , 2 Xincheng Shu , 1 , 2 Qi Xuan , 1 , 2 and Zhongyuan Ruan 1 , 2 , ∗ 1 Institute of Cyberspace Security , Zhejiang University of Technology , Hangzhou 310023 , China 2 Binjiang Cyberspace Security Institute of ZJUT , Hangzhou 310051 , China During the outbreak of an epidemic , individuals may modify their behaviors in response to external ( including local and global ) infection - related information . However , the difference between local and global information in influencing the spread of diseases remains inadequately explored . Here we study a simple epidemic model that incorporates the game - based self - quarantine behavior of individuals , taking into account the influence of local infection status , global disease prevalence and node heterogeneity ( i . e . , non - uniform node degrees ) . Our findings reveal that local information can effectively contain an epidemic , even with only a small proportion of individuals opting for self - quarantine . On the other hand , global information can induce oscillations in infection evolution curves during the declining phase of an epidemic , owing to the synchronous release of nodes with the same degree from the quarantined state . In contrast , the releasing pattern under the local information appears to be more random . This oscillation phenomenon can be observed in various types of networks associated with different characteristics . Significantly , our model is essentially different from conventional epidemic models in that the network heterogeneity plays a negative role in the spread of epidemics , which is contrary to the previous findings . I . INTRODUCTION The widespread of the COVID - 19 disease in recent years has infected billions of people and led to more than 6 million fatalities , a number that may be significantly underestimated [ 1 ] . This unprecedented global health crisis has sparked ex - tensive research into modeling and understanding the dynam - ics of the epidemic [ 2 – 7 ] . By employing traditional epidemic models , such as the susceptible - infected - removed ( SIR ) and susceptible - exposed - infected - removed ( SEIR ) models , re - searchers have gained valuable insights of how the coron - avirus disease diffuses in the population . Nevertheless , obser - vations from real epidemic data demonstrate that the spread pattern of COVID - 19 deviates significantly from these ideal - ized models , which typically exhibit a single peak and a near - symmetric decline [ 8 , 9 ] . While in reality , the epidemic curves seem more complicated , which may present oscillations and other complex features [ 9 – 11 ] . One possible reason is that the conventional models over - look the effect of human reactions during an epidemic , which can substantially influence the epidemic dynamics [ 12 – 16 ] . For instance , when susceptible individuals become aware of being surrounded by infected individuals , they may take mea - sures such as wearing face masks to reduce their susceptibil - ity ( hence the infection rate is reduced ) [ 17 , 18 ] . Some stud - ies extended this idea to multiplex networks , and showed that the onset of the epidemic largely depends on the information spreading dynamics [ 19 – 23 ] . In addition to the aforemen - tioned behaviors , the susceptibles may rewire their network connections to avoid contracting the disease [ 24 – 26 ] . These adaptive behaviors can give rise to rich dynamics such as os - cillations , hysteresis and first order transitions [ 24 ] . It should be emphasized that these studies generally assume that the be - ∗ Electronic address : zyruan @ zjut . edu . cn havior changes of individuals are driven by local infection in - formation obtained from their immediate neighborhood . On the other side , global information regarding the preva - lence of an epidemic , disseminated through newspapers , web - sites , television programs and other media channels play a crucial role in the disease spreading process as well . Sev - eral early studies have investigated the impact of public per - ceptions ( or disease prevalence ) on vaccination behavior dur - ing an epidemic [ 27 – 30 ] . A few recent works considered this problem within the framework of multiplex networks , mainly focusing on the influence on the epidemic threshold [ 31 , 32 ] . For example , it was shown that global information ( as well as the local information ) can enhance self - protection awareness of individuals , thereby reducing the infection probability and inhibiting the spread of epidemics . Wu et al . further demon - strated that the global awareness cannot decrease the outbreak threshold of an epidemic ( but can reduce the epidemic preva - lence ) , while the local awareness can [ 33 ] . Despite of these progresses , the different influences of lo - cal and global information on epidemic dynamics , particu - larly in terms of their effects on evolution curves , remains largely unexplored . In this paper , we extend the classical SIR model by introducing an additional state Q , representing self - quarantine , and assume that the susceptible nodes would make decisions whether to self - isolate or not based on a game strategy , which takes into account the local infection status of a node ( local information ) , the overall disease prevalence ( global information ) , and individual heterogeneity ( node de - grees follow a distribution ) . We focus on how these factors may affect the evolution of an epidemic , and aim to provide a different perspective on the observed phenomena , such as oscillations in epidemics . This paper is organized as follows . In Sec . II . , we in - troduce our model which incorporates the game - based self - quarantine behavior into the classical SIR model . In Sec . III , we present the numerical simulations on synthetic net - works , including random Erd˝os - R´enyi ( ER ) and Barab´asi - Albert ( BA ) networks . In Sec . IV , we present the numeri - a r X i v : 2 3 08 . 02623v1 [ phy s i c s . s o c - ph ] 4 A ug 2023 2 cal simulations on some realistic networks . Finally , we give conclusions in Sec . V . II . SIR MODEL WITH GAME - BASED SELF - QUARANTINE We start by considering the SIR model on a contact network comprising of N nodes and E edges . In the standard SIR model , nodes in the network can be in three different states : susceptible , infected , or removed ( representing death or im - munization ) . Each susceptible node is infected with prob - ability β at each time step if it is connected to an infected node . Meanwhile , each infected node transitions to the re - moved state with probability µ . In our model , we further in - corporate game - based mechanism , assuming that the suscep - tibles would decide whether to self - isolate or not by weighing the gain and loss of quarantine . Specifically , we employ game theory and introduce two cost functions for each node i : C ei and C qi , which denote the perceived cost of exposure and the perceived cost of quaran - tine , respectively . It is worth noticing that in reality , individu - als may not evaluate these costs precisely . We assume that the perceived cost of exposure ( or the perceived risk of infection ) increases with the prevalence of an epidemic . In particular , both the local infection status ( the fraction of immediate in - fected neighbors a node has , denoted by ρ nni ) and the global prevalence level ( the fraction of infected nodes in the entire system , denoted by ρ I ) may contribute in C ei : C ei = a 1 ρ nni + a 2 ρ I , ( 1 ) where a 1 , a 2 > 0 are two control parameters , representing the sensitivity to the local and global infection information , respectively . Larger a 1 ( or a 2 ) indicates individuals are more responsive to the increase of infected nodes . The second term in Eq . ( 1 ) acts like a mean - field effect , which exerts on all nodes . Note that ρ I ( and ρ nni ) is time - dependent , thus C ei is also time - dependent . On the other hand , we assume that the cost of quarantine for node i is related to the degree k i of that node : C qi = η ( 1 − e − bk i ) , ( 2 ) where the parameters η , b > 0 . The above definition implies that the cost of quarantine increases with node degree , which is consistent with the observation that highly influential nodes ( corresponding to a large degree ) are often hesitant to self - isolate in reality . Without loss of generality , we set η = 1 and b = 0 . 02 in this paper . At each time step , every susceptible node decides to self - isolate and enters the quarantined state ( denoted as Q ) if C ei > C qi . Meanwhile , the quarantined nodes return to the susceptible state if C ei < C qi . In summary , our model can be FIG . 1 : ( color online ) . Schematic illustration of the model . ( a ) Evo - lution of the contact network . The global information ( related to the overall infected density ρ I ) acts like a mean field , which may ex - ert influence over each susceptible node . The local infection status varies from one node to another . Note that the self - quarantined nodes cannot be infected by other nodes , and thus are equivalent to being removed from the network temporally . ( b ) Self - quarantine strategy for nodes . If the cost of quarantine exceeds the cost of exposure , a node will decide not to self - isolate ( or release from the quarantined state ) ; Otherwise , it will enter the quarantined state . represented as follows : S i + I j β −→ I i + I j I i µ −→ R i S i C ei > C qi −−−−−→ Q i Q i C ei < C qi −−−−−→ S i ( 3 ) Note that the quarantined nodes are equivalent to being re - moved from the network temporarily , which may rejoin the network ( along with their links ) through the game strategy . Our model is a generalization of the standard SIR model , and we refer to it as the SIR - Q model . The schematic illustration of the model is shown in Fig . 1 . III . SIR - Q MODEL IN SYNTHETIC NETWORKS We first focus on a random ER network with size N = 5000 and number of edges E = 25 , 000 . We put these edges ran - domly between each pair of nodes , which results in an ex - act average degree ⟨ k ⟩ = 10 , and a Poisson distribution in node degrees [ 34 ] . The epidemic parameters are chosen as : β = 0 . 012 and µ = 0 . 01 . Initially , 0 . 5 % of nodes are se - lected at random as seeds to be infected , while all the remain - ing nodes are in the susceptible state . To quantify the spread - ing effect , we define ρ X ( X = S , I , R , Q ) as the fraction of the X component among all nodes . To proceed , we consider a simple case where a 2 = 0 , mean - ing that individuals can only be affected by local information . Figure 2 shows the fraction of nodes in different states ( ρ I , ρ R and ρ Q ) as a function of time t for various a 1 . We see that as a 1 increases , the peak of ρ I declines [ as shown in Fig . 2 ( a ) ] , and the asymptotic value of ρ R decreases [ as shown in Fig . 3 0 200 400 600 800 1000 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 I ( a ) a 1 = 0 . 5 a 1 = 1 . 0 a 1 = 2 . 0 a 1 = 3 . 0 0 200 400 600 800 1000 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 R ( b ) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 t 0 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 Q ( c ) 0 1 2 3 4 a 1 0 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 m a x Q FIG . 2 : ( color online ) .

The inset in ( c ) shows how the max - imum value of ρ Q changes with a 1 . Curves are averaged over 100 realizations . 2 ( b ) ] , meaning that larger a 1 could effectively suppress the epidemic . This result is straightforward , since raising a 1 en - hances the exposure cost ( C ei ) of nodes connecting to infected individuals , thereby motivating them to self - isolate . Conse - quently , the spread of the epidemic is impeded . On the other hand , the number of quarantined nodes dis - plays a non - monotonic change with a 1 . As illustrated in Fig . 2 ( c ) , we observe that the peak of ρ Q rises as a 1 increases at first , primarily due to the growth in C ei for nodes that are con - nected to infected individuals . However , further increasing a 1 leads to a decrease in ρ Q . This behavior can be qualitatively understood as follows : For large values of a 1 , the susceptibles become highly sensitive to their infected neighbors . Even a very small fraction of infected neighbors can prompt them to self - isolate immediately . As a consequence , the epidemic is difficult to spread out , and the majority of nodes remain safe from infection , resulting in a small number of nodes opting for self - isolation . Upon initial inspection , from Eq . ( 1 ) , it appears that global infection information ( ρ I ) plays a similar role to local infor - mation ( ρ nni ) . Therefore , one might expect that the influence of parameter a 2 to be the same as a 1 . Indeed , we observe that as a 2 increases , the epidemic spreading is suppressed , as shown in Fig . 3 ( a ) and ( b ) . However , we also note two dis - tinct differences : 1 . Epidemic curves exhibit oscillations dur - ing the declining phase of the epidemic as shown in Fig . 3 ( a ) . 2 . The peak of the quarantined density decreases ( meaning that the number of quarantined nodes shrinks ) monotonically 0 500 1000 1500 2000 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 I ( a ) a 2 = 0 . 0 a 2 = 0 . 5 a 2 = 1 . 0 a 2 = 2 . 0 0 500 1000 1500 2000 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 R ( b ) 0 500 1000 1500 2000 t 0 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 Q ( c ) 0 1 2 3 4 a 2 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 m a x Q FIG . 3 : ( color online ) .

This second result is not difficult to com - prehend if we notice that all susceptible nodes ( even those without any infected neighbors ) would be synchronously af - fected by the infected individuals at each time step , while the local infection information can only influence the population exposed to the disease . To understand the oscillation behavior , we calculate the number of nodes released from the quarantined state at each time step , denoted as n Q → S . Figure 4 ( a ) and ( b ) depict the variation of n Q → S with respect to time t for a 2 = 0 ( a 1 > 0 ) and a 2 > 0 ( a 1 = 0 ) , respectively . The corresponding evo - lution curves of the infected density ρ I are also presented ( in - dicated by the red curves ) . It is evident that the processes of releasing nodes from quarantined state differ significantly be - tween the two cases . In the scenario of a 2 = 0 ( i . e . , only local information is considered ) , n Q → S decreases smoothly over time during the decay phase of the epidemic . While the inclusion of global information ( corresponding to a 2 > 0 ) may result in “bursty” behaviors . Notably , we observe that the quarantined nodes are released discretely in groups over time [ the blue bars in Fig . 4 ( b ) ] . The concentrated emergence of susceptibles ( from the pool of quarantined nodes ) may lead to an extensive infection of nodes within a very short period of time , which contributes to the observed oscillations in the infection curves . To gain deeper insights , we further investigate the degrees of the released nodes at each time step .

The number of nodes released from the quarantined state at each time step is shown as well ( marked as blue bars ) . These results are averaged over 100 realizations . Average degree of the released nodes ¯ k r as a function of time t for ( c ) a 1 = 1 , a 2 = 0 , and ( d ) a 1 = 0 , a 2 = 1 . The color ( and the size of circles ) represents the variance of degrees . The inset in ( c ) shows the detailed degree of each node released at every time t . These results are obtained from one single realization . 1 n r ( t ) (cid:80) i ∈ Θ r ( t ) k i as the average degree of the nodes released at time t , where k i represents the degree of node i , Θ r ( t ) is the set of the released nodes at time t , and n r ( t ) is the size of the set . Figure 4 ( c ) and ( d ) present ¯ k r as a function of time for the two different cases , corresponding to Fig . 4 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . It is noteworthy that ¯ k r ( t ) displays a nega - tive correlation with t in both two cases , indicating that nodes with lower degrees tend to be released later in time . This can be attributed to the condition for releasing , i . e . , C ei < C qi , which suggests that k i > − 1 b ln ( 1 − a 1 η ρ nni − a 2 η ρ I ) . There - fore , nodes with high degrees are more likely to fulfill this condition and be released early . Nevertheless , due to the fluc - tuation of ρ nni across nodes ( if a 1 ̸ = 0 ) , nodes with various degrees may satisfy the above condition simultaneously , re - sulting in a large degree variance among the released nodes given time t [ see Fig . 4 ( c ) ] . In contrast , under the influ - ence of global information ( and a 1 = 0 ) , the release of nodes occurs in a more regular manner — nodes with the same de - gree would be released synchronously . This is indicated by a degree variance of 0 among the nodes released at time t , as shown in Fig . 4 ( d ) . Moreover , since ρ I decreases continu - ously in the declining phase of the epidemic , nodes would be released successively in descending order of their degrees . The aforementioned oscillation phenomenon is common and can also be observed in heterogeneous networks . To con - firm this , we perform simulations on the BA model [ 34 , 35 ] . In this network , the degree distribution follows a power - law distribution of the form P ( k ) ∼ k − 3 , indicating that the num - ber of nodes with degree k is a decreasing function of k .

Results are averaged over 100 realizations . ure 5 shows the time evolution of ρ I and n Q → S in the BA network . Again , we find that susceptible nodes are released discretely in groups . Different from the case of random ER networks , the group size increases with time in the BA net - work , owing to the delayed release of the large number of low - degree nodes . Correspondingly , the oscillation becomes increasingly notable as time progresses . To acquire an intu - itive perception , we estimate roughly the number of nodes that are released at time t . The lower boundary of degree that a node has such that it could be possibly released at time t is k c ( t ) = ⌈− 1 b ln ( 1 − 1 η ρ I ( t ) ) ⌉ , where we have assumed a 1 = 0 and a 2 = 1 . In the BA network , the number of nodes that sat - isfy this condition is l ( t ) ∼ (cid:82) ∞ k c k − 3 dk = k c ( t ) − 2 . During the declining phase of an epidemic ( i . e . , ρ I ( t ) decreases with t ) , k c ( t ) is a decreasing function of t , thereby l ( t ) increases with time t . Additionally , by comparing the infected density in the BA network with that in the ER network , we observe that the epi - demic is significantly suppressed . This finding seems contra - dictory to the conventional understanding that heterogeneous networks can facilitate the spread of an epidemic [ 36 – 38 ] . To understand this , it is important to notice that the previous stud - ies were based on the assumption that most of nodes are sus - ceptible , allowing hubs to effectively transmit the disease to a large portion of the network . However , in our model , the low - degree nodes are prone to self - isolate . Hence , in the BA network , which contains a large number of low - degree nodes , the epidemic is difficult to spread , even though the hubs may be readily contracted by the disease . 5 IV . SIR - Q MODEL IN REAL NETWORKS To further support the results obtained in the previous sec - tion , we analyze the SIR - Q model on some real - world net - works . The first example is a directed friendship network ob - tained from a survey on adolescent health ( AH ) [ 39 ] . Each student participating in the survey was asked to list their top 5 female and top 5 male friends . In the network , each node represents a student , and a directed link from node i to node j indicates that student i listed student j as one of their best friends . We disregard the weight of these relationships in our analysis . The second example is a scientific collaboration network that encompasses papers on General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology ( GrQc ) submitted to the e - print arXiv between January 1993 and April 2003 [ 40 ] . In this network , each node represents an author , and if two authors co - authored a paper , an undirected edge is added between them . The third dataset pertains to dynamic contact networks , which were col - lected during the INFECTIOUS exhibition held at the Science Gallery ( SG ) in Dublin , Ireland , from April 17 th to July 17 th , 2009 [ 41 ] . If two individuals were in contact for a minimum interval of 20 seconds , they are linked as nodes in the network . By integrating the contact instances over the entire time win - dow , we obtain an aggregated network , referred to as SG . The fourth network is bipartite , involving sex buyers and their es - corts ( SE ) [ 42 , 43 ] . Specifically , in this graph nodes represent buyers and escorts , and each edge indicates sexual relation - ship between a buyer and an escort . The main properties of the four networks are summarized in Table I . TABLE I : Statistics of the real - world networks . The parameters un - der consideration are : N , number of nodes ; E , number of edges ; k max , maximum degree ; ¯ c , average clustering coefficient [ 34 ] ; G , Gini coefficient , which measures the skewness of the degree distri - bution [ 44 ] .

We apply our epidemic model to each network and examine how the fraction of in - fected nodes ρ I changes with time t . As depicted in Fig . 6 ( a ) - ( d ) , it is evident that in each network , the evolution curve may exhibit oscillations during the declining phase of the epi - demic . It should be emphasized that these networks differ fun - damentally in many aspects , which highlights the universality of our findings . V .

Specifically , our model assumes that individ - uals make decisions whether to self - isolate or not by consid - ering the perceived costs of infection and quarantine , guided by infection information . Our focus is to explore the distinct effects of local and global information on the spread of epi - demics . We have shown that both local and global information can suppress epidemic spreading , but their impact on quaran - tine behavior differs significantly . Enhancing the sensitivity of nodes to local information can finally reduce the quaran - tined number , indicating that local information can suppress the epidemic by only influencing a small number of nodes to self - isolate . On the other hand , global infection information can trigger synchronous release of nodes with the same degree from the quarantine state , resulting in oscillations in the epi - demic evolution curves . In contrast , local information exhibits fluctuations across nodes , leading to a more random releasing pattern . Furthermore , we have shown that the oscillation phe - nomenon is widespread and can be observed in various types of networks . Finally , it is worth mentioning that our model is intrinsically different from traditional epidemic models , such as the SIR model , in that it demonstrates network heterogene - ity actually hinders the spread of a disease , as opposed to fa - cilitating it . This model may provide deep insights to under - standing the interplay between epidemics and external preva - lence information in reality . The framework proposed here can also be applied to other fields , such as social contagions [ 45 – 48 ] .
