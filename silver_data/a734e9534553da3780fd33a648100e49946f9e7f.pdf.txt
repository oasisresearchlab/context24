The yeast Arp2 / 3 complex is required for the internalization step of endocytosis . In addition , some early endocytic events in mammalian cells are associated with the forma - tion of actin tails similar to those generated by activated Arp2 / 3 complex . However , until now no Arp2 / 3 complex activator has been identified among proteins known to mediate early steps in endocytosis . Here we show that the yeast endocytic protein Pan1p binds to and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex . Genetic interactions between PAN1 and mutants of Arp2 / 3 subunits , or of the Arp2 / 3 activator LAS17 , provide evidence for this activity in vivo . We sug - gest that Pan1p forms the core of an endocytic complex and physically couples actin polymerization nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex to the endocytic machinery , thus pro - viding the forces necessary for endocytosis . L AS17 ( also called BEE1 ) encodes the single member of the Scar / WASP ( Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) family of Arp2 / 3 activators in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 1 , 2 . Although the Arp2 / 3 complex is essential for endocytosis in yeast , the Arp2 / 3 activation domain of Las17p is not , suggesting the existence of additional Arp2 / 3 complex activators ( Fig . 1 ) 3 , 4 . To identify genes with functions that overlap with that of LAS17 , we constructed double mutants that contained a temperature - sensitive allele of LAS17 ( las17 - 11 ) and alleles of genes involved in endocytosis ( data not shown ) . Double mutants combining las17 - 11 with alleles of SAC6 , SLA2 , SLA1 , RVS167 and RVS161 were viable . In contrast , lethality resulted when las17 - 11 was combined with mutations in genes encoding components of the Arp2 / 3 complex or with muta - tions in PAN1 . PAN1 , which encodes a yeast protein related to mammalian Eps15 , is an essential gene required for the internaliza - tion step of endocytosis 5 . The amino terminus of Pan1p makes multiple interactions with other proteins involved in endocytosis . These include Sla1p and End3p , two proteins implicated in endo - cytic and cytoskeletal function , and also the clathrin - binding pro - teins Yap1801p , Yap1802p , Ent1p and Ent2p 6 – 8 . Pan1p contains an acidic stretch with a carboxy - terminal tryp - tophan residue , which is similar to motifs found in all known Arp2 / 3 activators ( Fig . 2a ) . The presence of this motif , together with the genetic interaction with las17 - 11 , indicated that Pan1p might be an activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex . The arp2 - 1 allele is nonviable when combined with an allele of LAS17 ( las17 - 16 ) that lacks the C - terminal 21 amino acids that encode part of the Arp2 / 3 activation domain ( data not shown ) . We therefore speculated that the arp2 - 1 allele might be sensitized to defects in Arp2 / 3 activation . We found that pan1 - 4 , a temperature - sensitive allele of PAN1 , was nonviable when combined with arp2 - 1 . The region of Pan1p required in the presence of the arp2 - 1 allele was mapped to the C - terminal 625 residues by using deletion mutants ( Fig . 2 ) . Alone , this C - terminal deletion of Pan1p showed no temperature sensitiv - ity and only very mild defects in actin cytoskeleton organization ( Fig . 1 ) . However , it exhibited a severe defect in endocytosis as assessed by Lucifer Yellow uptake and Ste6p degradation ( Fig . 1 and data not shown ) . These results are striking because all other known endocytic mutants additionally show severe defects in actin cytoskeleton organization 9 . In particular , deletions of S . cerevisiae genes LAS17 or MYO3 and MYO5 , which are implicated in the function of the Arp2 / 3 complex , show endocytic defects , but they also cause severe defects in actin cytoskeleton organization 10 – 14 . In PAN1 C - terminal deletion , the endocytic defect seems not to be due to a secondary effect of a severely defective actin cytoskeleton . When combined with a deletion of the Arp2 / 3 activation domain of Las17p ( las17 - 16 ) , deletion of the Pan1p C terminus caused temperature sensitivity ( Fig . 2d ) . The double mutant had severe defects in actin organization , although either allele on its Wild type las17 - 16 pan1 D 855 – 1480 pan1 D 855 – 1480 , las17 - 16 LY DIC Actin Figure 1 In vivo effect of deletion of Pan1p residues 896 – 1480 . C - terminal deletion of Pan1p residues 896 – 1480 causes an endocytic defect alone , and a synthetic actin organization defect when combined with las17 - 16 . Lucifer Yellow ( LY ) uptake was examined by fluorescence microscopy ; Differential interference contrast images were taken of the same cells . Eighty per cent ( n = 182 ) of wild - type cells exhibited vacuoles that could be visualized by LY staining ; 12 % ( n = 268 ) of Pan1p C - terminal delete cells showed LY staining , and the intensity of these vac - uoles was less than in the wild type . Filamentous actin was stained with rho - damine – phalloidin and examined by fluorescence microscopy .

Cells of the double mutant often contained abnormal cortical actin structures that were larger and less well restricted to the region of growth than wild - type actin cortical patches ( Fig . 1 ) . These cells also seemed to contain more filamentous actin than normal . Both of these phenotypes were similar to those described previously for mutants of some Arp2 / 3 subunits 15 . The C - terminal region of Pan1p contains the acidic motif , a region of predicted coiled coil , and a proline - rich region ( Fig . 2b ) . On the basis of the importance of the acidic motif for the function of other Arp2 / 3 activators , we generated a mutation of the acidic motif , changing residues 1277 – 1280 , including the conserved tryp - tophan , to alanines ( pan1 - 101 ) . This mutation alone exhibited no temperature sensitivity and , unlike the C - terminal deletion , showed no defect in endocytosis . However , when combined with the arp2 - 1 mutation the double mutant exhibited lethality at 34 (cid:176) C , demonstrating the importance of the Pan1p acidic motif for func - tion in vivo ( Fig . 2d ) . The defects associated with pan1 - 101 and pan1 D 855 – 1480 are not due to lack of protein expression because both proteins are expressed at levels equal to or higher , respective - ly , than that of the wild type ( Fig . 2c ) . pan1 D 97 – 390 is also expressed at an elevated level but shows no genetic interactions with arp2 - 1 or las17 - 16 , suggesting that the elevated protein levels of pan1 D 855 – 1480 do not cause the defects observed . To investigate whether Pan1p indeed binds to and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex , we purified Pan1p fragments from yeast . In co - sedimentation assays , purified glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - tagged Pan1p fragments bound with sub - micromolar affinity to 3 - haemagglutinin ( HA ) - tagged Arp2 / 3 complex immobilized on beads . The C - terminal 532 residues of Pan1p were sufficient for this binding ( Fig . 3a ) . Similarly , GST - tagged Pan1p immobilized on glu - tathione – agarose also bound purified untagged Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3b ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex has modest intrinsic activity to stim - ulate actin polymerization , which can be enhanced by the presence of a Scar / WASP type activator or Listeria ActA 16 , 17 . We purified endogenous yeast Arp2 / 3 complex and tested whether purified Pan1p fragments could stimulate its nucleation activity in vitro . A GST - tagged Pan1p fragment encoding residues 96 – 1480 was capa - ble of activating purified yeast Arp2 / 3 complex to levels nearly as high as the maximal activation of yeast Arp2 / 3 complex by Listeria ActA ( Fig . 4a , c ) . The smaller fragment encoding the C - terminal 532 residues of Pan1p failed to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( data not shown ) . Thus , although sufficient for binding , the C terminus lacks some feature required for activation . Given the genetic inter - action between pan1 - 101 and the arp2 - 1 allele , we generated a GST - tagged Pan1p fragment encoding the pan1 - 101 mutation . Although this mutant protein was enfeebled in activation activity , it was capa - ble of increasing actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 4b , c ) . Similar mutations of the acidic motif of Listeria ActA and human WASP also reduced but did not eliminate Arp2 / 3 complex activa - tion 17 , 18 . The residual activity of the mutant Pan1p protein might explain the less severe phenotype of this mutant in vivo compared with C - terminal truncation . Lower levels of actin polymerization provided by the pan1 - 101 allele might be sufficient for endocytosis . Here we have shown that Pan1p binds to and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro .

Pan1p’s role as an Arp2 / 3 activator , together with the specific endocytosis defect of the PAN1 C - terminal dele - tion allele , suggest that Pan1p might stimulate the Arp2 / 3 complex during the internalization step of endocytosis . The N terminus of Pan1p binds to four proteins that interact with clathrin and possi - bly with phospholipids : the clathrin adaptor proteins yAP1801p and yAP1802p , and the yeast epsins Ent1p and Ent2p 7 , 19 ( Fig . 5 ) . The N terminus of yAP1801p and yAP1802p are highly similar to a region of mammalian AP180 known to interact with phospho - lipids 20 . In addition , Ent1p and Ent2p contain epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domains , which have recently been suggested to interact with phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) ( ref . 21 ) . Pan1p also binds to End3p , an endocytic protein with potential PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding activity 6 , 22 . We suggest that Pan1p might be recruited to sites of endocytosis through its contacts with some or all of these proteins . Once it has been thus localized , we further suggest that the Pan1p complex recruits the Arp2 / 3 complex to the endocytic machinery . Concomitant actin polymerization induced by the activated Arp2 / 3 complex might provide forces to deform the plasma membrane , to complete clo - sure of the budded vesicle , or to propel the completed vesicle away from the plasma membrane . In support of a role in vesicle closure , pan1 - 3 cells at the non - permissive temperature accumulate long invaginations suggestive of incomplete or failed closure 5 . Whether the Arp2 / 3 activation activity of Pan1p is evolutionarily conserved remains untested . We note that Eps15 , like Pan1p , contains acidic and proline - rich stretches at its C terminus , which is consistent with such a possibility . It is also intriguing that Eps15 is positioned to have a role in vesicle closure , as it localizes to the plasma mem - brane - proximal edge of budding clathrin - coated vesicles in vivo 23 . Finally , these observations might shed light on the previously unexplained intimate link between actin and endocytosis . In yeast , screens for identifying genes involved in endocytosis have often led to genes that are also functionally involved in the actin cytoskele - ton , and many genes first examined for roles in the actin cytoskele - ton have been later shown to be involved in endocytosis 9 , 19 . Our results suggest that Pan1p might link these two systems , allowing the endocytic machinery to harness actin polymerization . Methods Strains and plasmids . Strains for protein purification were : BJ2168 ( ref . 24 ) , DDY1519 and DDY1861 ( Arp2 - 3xHA : HIS5 ) generated by the method described in ref . 25 , in DDY1519 .

The las17 - 11 allele was generated by random error mutagenesis with the polymerase chain reaction . In brief , the LAS17 gene was amplified with Taq polymerase ( Promega ) , a las17 D strain was co - transformed with the amplified DNA and a centromeric plasmid containing LAS17 that was lin - earized by restriction digest with Msc I and Aat II . Colonies were screened for temperature sensitivity and re - screened for normal actin staining at 25 (cid:176) C . The las17 - 11 allele was isolated from one such colony and the mutated coding region was used to replace the genomic locus creating the las17 - 11 strains used in this study . Plasmids for expressing Pan1p fragments were generated as follows : pDD894 , an Msc I – Xba I frag - ment of PAN1 ( residues 96 – 1480 ) cloned into the Sma I site of pEGKT ; pDD 899 , the same as pDD894 with residues 1277 – 1280 mutated to alanine residues with the Quickchange method ( Stratagene ) ; pDD895 , an Eco RV – Xba I fragment of PAN1 ( residues 948 – 1480 ) cloned into the Sma I site of pEGKT 26 . Plasmids pAS249 ( CEN , URA3 , PAN1 ) , pAS256 ( CEN , TRP1 , PAN1 ) , pAS324 ( CEN , TRP1 , PAN1 - D 97 – 390 ) and pAS347 ( CEN , TRP1 , PAN1 - D 855 – 1480 ) for expressing deletions of domains of PAN1 in arp2 - 1 and las17 - 16 cells were described in ref . 27 . pDD897 was generated by cloning a genomic Xmn I – Dra I fragment containing PAN1 into pRS415 . pDD898 was generated by replacing an Eco RI – Sbf I fragment from pDD899 into pDD897 . Plasmid pSM672 ( 2 m URA3 , STE6 - HA ) for Ste6p endocytosis assays was described in ref . 8 . Protein purification and in vitro assays . GST proteins were purified from BJ2168 carrying the appropriate expression plasmid essentially as described in refs 24 , 28 . Cells were grown to an absorbance of 1 . 0 at 600nm ( A 600 ) in synthetic medi - um supplemented with 2 % raffinose . Cultures were induced overnight by the addition of 20gl - 1 yeast extract , 40gl - 1 Bacto - tryptone and 50mll - 1 40 % ( w / v ) galactose . High - speed supernatants were gen - erated and applied to a Hi - Trap Q - Sepharose 5ml column ( Pharmacia ) . Proteins were eluted with 15 ml 0 . 5M NaCl in PBS , diluted to 50ml in PBS , and bound and eluted in a batch from glutathione – Sepharose beads ( Sigma ) in accordance with the manufacturer’s directions . Proteins were dialysed against HEK buffer ( 20mM Hepes pH7 . 5 , 1mM EDTA , 50mM KCl ) with 5 % ( v / v ) glycerol , then flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen . Native yeast Arp2 / 3 complex was purified as described in detail in Goode et al . 29 . In brief , lysates were generated from DDY1519 as described above , except that frozen cells were thawed in HEK buffer . Glycerol was added to the low - speed supernatant to a final concentration of 10 % . MgCl 2 and ATP were added to the high - speed supernatant to 5mM and 0 . 2mM , respectively . After 2h the supernatant was centrifuged at 17 , 000r . p . m . for 90min in an SA600 rotor ( Sorvall ) . Pellets were washed in 4ml HEK buffer containing 10 % glycerol and 5mM MgCl 2 and re - pelleted at 90 , 000r . p . m . for 20min in a Beckman TLA100 . 3 rotor . The pellets were rinsed and resuspended in 3ml G - buffer ( 50mM Tris / HCl pH7 . 5 , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 2mM dithiothreitol and 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 ) , dispersed in a 30 - ml Dounce homog - enizer ( Wheaton ) and diluted in 50ml G - buffer for 2h to depolymerize the actin . This material was spun at 70 , 000r . p . m . for 70min in a Beckman 70Ti rotor and the supernatant was loaded and eluted on a 30ml 10 – 700mM gradient of NaCl in HEK buffer in a High - Trap Q column ( Pharmacia ) . Arp2 / 3 fractions were pooled and concentrated with a Microcon - 10 concentrator device ( Amicon ) . The concentrated protein was fractionated on a Superose - 12 column pre - equilibrated with HEK . Arp2 / 3 fractions were concentrated and flash - frozen . Yeast actin was purified as described in ref . 28 . Pyrene rabbit muscle actin was from Cytoskeleton Inc . Actin polymerization assays were performed as in ref . 29 , except that actin was precleared for 30 min at 90 , 000r . p . m . before use , and 3 m M monomeric yeast actin and 0 . 15 m M pyrene rabbit muscle actin were used . Reaction conditions were as follows : 38 m l actin in G - buffer were combined with 15 m l HEK buffer with 5 % glycerol containing 20nM Arp2 / 3 complex and / or activator , and polymerization was initiated by the addition of a mixture ( 7 m l ) of 250mM KCl , 20mM MgCl 2 and 5mM ATP . Pyrene fluorescence data were collected by using a Fluoromax 2 fluorometer ( Jobin - Yvon Horiba ) . The number of ends was calculated as R / ( 0 . 8 · K + ) , where R is the polymerization rate at 20 % of total polymerization when maximum polymerization was normalized to 1 and K + = 10 m M - 1 s - 1 ( ref . 18 ) . HA - Arp2 / 3 beads were generated by incubating 200 m l protein A – Sepharose beads ( Pharmacia ) with 1 m g mouse anti - HA antibody , HA . 11 ( Covance ) per m l of beads . The antibody beads were incubated with 15ml high - speed supernatant from strains DDY1861 ( HA - Arp2 ) or DDY1519 ( control ) prepared as for Arp2 / 3 purification , with the omission of glycerol , MgCl 2 and ATP and with the addition of 2 mM Latrunculin A . Non - specific proteins were stripped with 500mM salt in HEK . To test for Arp2 / 3 – Pan1p binding , purified GST – Pan1p fragments were incubated with HA – Arp2 / 3 beads at room temperature for 1h . Beads were washed once with 200 m l HEK buffer , and Arp2 / 3 - bound proteins were disassociated with boiling SDS sample buffer . For estimates of K d , various quantities of HA – Arp2 / 3 beads were incubated with 200nM GST – Pan1p in HEKG5 and the level of bound protein was analysed by western blotting with rabbit anti - Pan1p . By this method we obtained a K d of 100 – 500nM . For GST – Pan1p binding to purified Arp2 / 3 complex , 10pM Arp2 / 3 complex was incubated with 200nM GST or GST – Pan1p residues 96 – 1480 and 15 m l preswollen glutathione – agarose beads in 30 m l HEK buffer supplemented with 5 % glycerol and 1 % Triton X - 100 . Bound proteins were washed three times , eluted with boiling SDS sample buffer and revealed by silver staining of the polyacrylamide gel . Cell culture . ‘Plasmid shuffle’ for the purpose of testing the deletion mutants in combination with arp2 - 1 and las17 - 16 mutations was performed as described in ref . 27 . The Ste6p degradation assay was performed as described in ref . 8 . Microscopy . Rhodamine – phalloidin staining was performed as in ref . 30 . For assay with Lucifer Yellow , 1 . 5ml of cells at an attenuance of 0 . 1 at 600nm were resuspended in 100 m l YPD medium with 4mgml - 1 Lucifer Yellow ( Sigma – Aldrich – Fluka ) . Cells were incubated for 1h at 25 (cid:176) C in Microfuge tubes with perforated lids . Metabolism was stopped by the addition of 1ml ice - cold 50mM potassium phosphate buffer pH7 . 5 containing 10mM NaN 3 and 10mM NaF . Cells were washed and resuspended in the phosphate solution . Epifluorescence was performed as in ref . 30 . RECEIVED 23 AUGUST 2000 ; REVISED 9 FEBRUARY 2001 ; ACCEPTED 4 APRIL 2001 ; PUBLISHED 12 JUNE 2001 . 1 . Winter , D . , Lechler , T . & Li , R . Curr .
