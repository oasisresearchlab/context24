In the case of ox - idative stress due for instance to hydrogen peroxide exposure , the adaptation response relies on co - regulation of enzymes in both glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways ( PPP ) , so as to support PPP - dependent NADPH and redox homeostasis . To understand the regulatory logic underlying early oxidative stress response , available metabolomics and 13 C ﬂuxomics dataset are used to infer a probabilistic ensemble of kinetic models . Model ensemble properties of parameter distributions , transient dynamics , dose - response curves and loss - of - function phenotypes all highlights signiﬁcant and cooperative eﬀects of allosteric regulations of G6PD , PGI and GAPD in early oxidative response . Indeed , eﬃcient ﬂux rerouting into PPP is shown to require dose - dependent co - ordination between upregulated G6PD enzyme and increased G6P metabolite , the latter requiring ﬁne - tuned inhibition of upper and lower glycolytic enzymes . This set of allosteric regulation also combines negative and positive feedback loops in a subtle manner prone to generate paradoxical perturbation phenotypes for instance related to 6PGD modulation . Introduction The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway ( OxPPP ) is a fundamental pathway of glucose metabolism involved in nucleotid biosynthesis and redox homeostasis ( Stincone et al . , 2015 ) . Its role is prominent following an oxidative stress to generate NADPH required for fueling anti - oxidant machinery and producing biosynthetic precursors * corresponding author 1 required for repairing DNA damages . A signiﬁcant increase of metabolic ﬂux in this pathway is commonly observed in any living cells subjected to oxidative stress ( Ben - Yoseph et al . , 1996 ; Ralser et al . , 2007 ; LaMonte et al . , 2013 ; Kuehne et al . , 2015 ; Christodoulou et al . , 2018 ; Nikel et al . , 2021 ) . A common rationale for such metabolic ﬂux rerouting relies on the acknowledged roles of NADP as a coenzyme and NADPH as a competitive inhibitors of the ﬁrst oxidation reaction of the OxPPP ( Warburg and Christian , 1936 ; Negelein and Haas , 1935 ; Eggleston and Krebs , 1974 ) . The scavenging activity of glutathione antioxidant is coupled to the oxidation of NADPH into NADP + , which is therefore prone to increase G 6 PD activity and NADPH production . However , oxidative stress has also been shown to induce directly or indirectly the allosteric inhibition of diverse glycolytic enzymes such as PGI ( Kuehne et al . , 2015 ; Dubreuil et al . , 2020 ) , GAPD ( Ralser et al . , 2007 ; Peralta et al . , 2015 ) , PK ( Anastasiou et al . , 2011 ) or TPI ( Gr¨uning et al . , 2014 ) . A complex pattern of regulation at the levels of PPP and glycolysis raises the question of their coordination for eﬃcient metabolic rerouting . The metabolic network combining upper glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway displays a complicate branch - ing structure comprising both reversible and irreversible reactions , which obstructs intuitive understanding of mul - tisite metabolic regulation . To investigate complex regulatory patterns , the kinetic modeling framework is often used to disentangle the respective and cooperative roles of multiple feedback regulations ( Muzzey et al . , 2009 ; Rel´ogio et al . , 2011 ; Pfeuty et al . , 2018 ; Sander et al . , 2019 ) . Several kinetic models have addressed OxPPP dy - namics with respect to a speciﬁc organism and experimental dataset ( Thorburn and Kuchel , 1985 ; Schuster and Holzh¨utter , 1995 ; Kerkhoven et al . , 2013 ) . Nowadays , advanced metabolomics and ﬂuxomics studies such as kinetic measurements of concentrations and isotopic labeling patterns provide a rich material to build increasingly reliable and comprehensive kinetic models ( Miskovic et al . , 2015 ; Foster et al . , 2019 ; Hameri et al . , 2019 ) . Regarding the regulation of the oxidative stress response , such data are available and have already been analyzed in terms of signiﬁcance and ranking of diverse regulatory hypothesis ( Kuehne et al . , 2015 , 2017 ; Christodoulou et al . , 2019 ) . However , questions remain about the interplay and cooperativity between those diﬀerent regulatory mechanisms . In the present study , we aim to build a class of kinetic models inferred from a comprehensive dataset associated with the oxidative stress response of ﬁbroblast ( Kuehne et al . , 2015 ) . On the one hand , the network structure of the model is chosen to ﬁt with the available data and with the objective to understand metabolic ﬂux rerouting for H 2 O 2 detoxiﬁcation . On the other hand , ﬂux analysis from 13 C - labeling data and parameter estimation from ﬂux and concentration data are based on Monte Carlo sampling methods ( Saa and Nielsen , 2016 ; St . John et al . , 2019 ; Valderrama - Baham´ondez and Fr¨ohlich , 2019 ; Theorell and N¨oh , 2020 ) so as generate a representative sample of kinetic models consistent with experimental measurement values and their uncertainties . From such model ensemble , we perform a comprehensive set of analysis regarding parameter distributions , transient dynamical responses , dose - response properties and gain / loss - of - function phenotypes , which portrays the manner how allosteric regulations contribute to the metabolic response upon oxidative stress . In particular , these analysis converge to the notion that distributed allosteric regulation is required for eﬃcient metabolic rerouting where regulatory mechanisms display 2 both complementary and cooperative roles .

( B ) Modeling workﬂow from 13C ﬂuxomics and metabolomics data ( Kuehne et al . , 2015 ) to kinetic model ensemble , ending with regulation analysis of transient response , dose response and gain / loss - of - function phenotypes We design a metabolic model whose speciﬁcities match with the particular context of the early metabolic response to oxidative stress ( Figure 1A ) . So far , kinetic models of oxidative stress response investigate early intra - cellular responses either at the level of antioxidant pathways ( Adimora et al . , 2010 ; Kembro et al . , 2013 ; Benfeitas et al . , 2014 ) or at the level of metabolic glycolysis and PPP pathways ( Thorburn and Kuchel , 1985 ; Schuster and Holzh¨utter , 1995 ; Kerkhoven et al . , 2013 ; Christodoulou et al . , 2018 ) . The latter studies were either considering passive metabolic response without regulation or exploring all possible metabolic - enzyme interactions . In contrast , our model speciﬁcally addresses the respective role of a subset of regulatory mechanisms that has been acknowledged to contribute to some respect to rapid metabolic adaptation to oxidative stress ( Mullarky and Cantley , 2015 ; Dick and Ralser , 2015 ) , namely NADPH - dependent inhibition of PPP enzymes ( Yoshida and Lin , 1973 ; Christodoulou et al . , 2018 ) , 6 PG - dependent inhibition of PGI ( Kahana et al . , 1960 ; Gaitonde et al . , 1989 ; Kuehne et al . , 2015 ; Dubreuil et al . , 2020 ) , H 2 O 2 - dependent inhibition of GAPD ( Ralser et al . , 2007 ; Peralta et al . , 2015 ; van der Reest et al . , 2018 ) and regulation of NADPH - consuming or - producing reactions ( Fan et al . , 2014 ; Jiang et al . , 2016 ; 3 Chen et al . , 2019 ) . The dynamics of the metabolic network including the selected pathways and regulations shown in Figure 1A is described by the diﬀerential equation system : d(cid:126)x dt = S (cid:126)φ ( (cid:126)x , H , (cid:126)p ) ( 1 ) where (cid:126)x = [ x i = 1 , 16 ] represents the concentrations of metabolite species i , (cid:126)φ = [ φ j = 1 , 23 ] represents the reaction rates associated to enzymes j , S is the stoichiometry matrix , H is the extracellular H 2 O 2 and (cid:126)p = [ p k = 1 , 48 ] represents the enzymatic or regulatory parameters ( see Supplementary Material for details ) . The steady - state equation is given by S (cid:126) Φ ( (cid:126)X , H , (cid:126)p ) = 0 where capitalized (cid:126)X and (cid:126) Φ denote steady - state concentration and ﬂux vectors . Within a kinetic modeling framework , the strategic workﬂow to study the metabolic ﬂux rerouting response following oxidative stress will proceed in several steps ( Figure 1B ) : ( i ) Collecting and processing 13C labeling and metabolomics data ( Kuehne et al . , 2015 ) , ( ii ) model parameter estimation of a kinetic model ( using genetic and Monte - Carlo algorithms ) to generate a plausible model ensemble and ( iii ) comprehensive analysis of these model ensembles to decipher the regulatory interplay for stress - induced metabolic ﬂux rerouting . Reﬁned analysis of metabolic ﬂux rerouting The stress - induced redistribution pattern of metabolic ﬂuxes can be inferred without knowledge about kinetic parameters . Although an expected feature of such redistribution is the increased ﬂux in the oxidative branch of PPP , it remains unclear to which extent is such increase and whether the OxPPP ﬂux is rather directed toward nucleotide production or toward the nonoxidative branch of the PPP . To gain a quantitative description of oxidative stress - induced redistribution of metabolic ﬂuxes , we reanalyse 13 C labelling data ( Kuehne et al . , 2015 ) using SSA - 13 CMFA to simulate the isotope labeling system ( Thommen et al . , 2022 ) and Monte Carlo ( MC ) sampling to determine posterior distribution of ﬂux parameters . We obtain a distribution of ﬂux for all reactions ( Figure 2A and S1A ) associated with an accurate ﬁt of mass itopomer data ( Figure S1C , D ) . The size of conﬁdence intervals associated to ﬂux distribution ( Figure S1B ) determines whether the ﬂux can be estimated accurately enough to be used as a constraint for kinetic modeling . The estimated ﬂux distribution pattern in absence and presence of oxidative stress can be summarized for the main branches of the metabolic network ( Figure 2B - C ) . The metabolic state in the unstressed condition corresponds to a glycolytic ﬂux mode where a minor fraction ( ∼ 20 % ) of glucose import ﬂux is diverted toward OxPPP ( Figure 2B ) . From such basal state , exposure of 500 µ M of extracellular hydrogen peroxide leads to a signiﬁcant increase of OxPPP ﬂux to ∼ 95 % which is further splitted toward nucleotid production and nonoxidative PPP ( Figure 2C ) . In addition to the net ﬂuxes associated to the branching architecture of the metabolic network , it is to note that some directional ﬂux could be estimated in the nonoxidative PPP reactions as well as in the reversible PGI reaction , which are valuable informations for kinetic model building . 4 C H = 500 μ M G6P F6P R5P GAP 100±0 % 5 . 2 ±6 . 1 % 24 . 7 ±9 . 9 % 9 . 8 ±4 . 7 % 94 . 8 ±6 . 1 % 65 . 6 ±14 % 59 . 1 ±24 % B H = 0 μ M G6P F6P R5P GAP 100±0 % 77 . 25 ±5 . 9 % 81 . 05 ±9 . 3 % 1 . 9 ±3 . 1 % 22 . 8 ±5 . 9 % 164 . 0 ±21 % 17 . 05 ±12 % A Figure 2 : Stress - induced ﬂux redistribution .

Estimation are restricted to a set of elementary ﬂux parameters ( while other ﬂuxes can be derived from balance equations ) where the index i indicates the enzyme and the index j indicates the directionality ( + are directed toward GAP ) , and where estimation is performed for basal ( B , blue ) or stress ( S , red ) conditions . Triangles indicate parameter estimation that are statistically - signiﬁcant based on the relative size of conﬁdence interval distribution ( Figure S1B ) . ( B - C ) Estimation of the ﬂux state in basal ( B ) and stress ( C ) conditions . Optimization and inference methods identify a plausible ensemble of kinetic models Besides the redistribution of metabolic ﬂuxes , oxidative stress response also induces rapid changes in metabolic concentrations at minute timescale ( Kuehne et al . , 2015 ) , which together provides a valuable dataset to estimate the parameters of kinetic models described by Equation 1 . Our parameter estimation problem consists in estimating the values of 36 parameters ( as 12 parameters are ﬁxed including equilibrium constant ) from a dataset of the early metabolic response comprising 13 estimated values of ﬂuxes in basal and stress conditions , and 12 measured values of concentration ratio . The procedure combines two classes of global optimization methods , namely an evolutionary genetic algorithm and a MCMC algorithm ( see Materials and Methods ) , following a stepwise strategy recapitulated in Figure 3A . First , the nRMSE ( Eq 3 ) of models whose parameters are randomly sampled ( 10 6 runs ) lies with a 50 % conﬁdence interval between 55 . 4 and 2 . 6 , thus conﬁrming the need of a dedicated parameter optimization procedure to ﬁnd parameter model consistent with experimental data . Second , an evolutionary genetic algorithm is used as a preliminary step to generate a sample of optimized models whose 50 % conﬁdence interval nRMSE values 5 0 μ M H2O2 500 μ M H2O2 Random set of parameters + Genetic Algorithm Best Score Selection + MCMC A B C D Figure 3 : Model selection and parameter estimation .

( D ) Whisker plots of parameters for the model ensemble P opt highlighting that parameter exploration is bounded to the white ( non - shaded ) parameter space lies between 3 and 0 . 8 . Third , a small subset of such local optimum solutions whose nRMSE ( p ) < 1 is used as initial conditions of MCMC sampling algorithm of the parameter space . The parameter distribution obtained with large enough sampling of ∼ 10 6 accepted steps ( i . e . , smooth stationary distribution for most parameters as shown in Figure S2A ) provides an estimation for parameter uncertainty and deﬁnes a statistical ensemble of kinetic model 6 that is called P opt and that is analyzed in details in the following . Such statistical model ensemble is characterised with a 50 % conﬁdence interval of nRMSE between 0 . 63 and 0 . 86 for which the estimated distributions of ﬂux and concentration ratio fall within the range of experimental uncertainties ( Figure 3B - C ) . Parameter distributions shown in Figure 3D discriminate between stiﬀ and sloppy parameters for which 50 % conﬁdence intervals span from few percents to several order of magnitude of parameter variations . Spectral analysis of correlation matrix conﬁrms indeed the existence of a few poorly estimated parameters generally associated with strong correlation between parameters of a same reaction ( Figure S2B , C ) . Last but not least , a dataset about dynamic and dose - dependent concentration responses is available ( Kuehne et al . , 2015 ) and has been retained to assess the predictive capability of the plausible set of model P opt ( Figure S3 ) . The timescale and threshold of concentration response are overall well predicted , except sparse discrepancies ( e . g . , lower threshold of 6 PG response ) that can be solved by adding these data in the score function . In summary , the parameter estimation procedure generates a plausible set of kinetic models whose parameters show rather narrow distributions , except some parameters that have a little impact on data adjustement or that can be compensated by change of other parameters . Importantly , most regulation parameters ( Ki G 6 PD , Ki GAPD and Ki PGI ) shows a narrow distribution , conﬁrming the role of these regulations in shaping the metabolic response to oxidative stress . In the following , we systematically perform analysis on this model ensemble P opt to draw a statistical picture of the regulatory properties . Transient dynamics during stress response displays a multiphasic time course The characteristics of the transient dynamics induced by the oxidative stress before reaching steady state gives some preliminary insights about the respective contribution of passive and regulated metabolic response ( Figure 4 ) . The minute time resolution in the time series dataset seemed not suﬃcient to identify trends arising at second timescale ( Christodoulou et al . , 2018 ) . In simulation of the model ensemble P opt , metabolite species within a same metabolic module share a similar dynamic response proﬁle ( Figure 4 ) . First , PPP metabolites display a rapid and signiﬁcant monophasic increase . Second , detoxifying NADPH and GSH metabolites display a fast and signiﬁcant decrease followed by a slower increase . Third , Glycolytic metabolites show moderate changes where a fast decrease seems followed by a slower increase . These diﬀerent temporal response patterns are typically characterized with a biphasic response where a fast passive response to perturbation is quickly followed by a slower regulated response . The biphasic nature of the transient response is illustrated in the case intracellular concentration of H 2 O 2 and G 6 P ( Figure 4B , C ) . H 2 O 2 shows a sharp increase about several order of magnitude whose timescale within seconds that relates to the basal degradation timescale k GR × KmG GPx ∼ 10s . The time proﬁle of H 2 O 2 later displays an overshoot in the time course where decrease of H 2 O 2 mirrors the increase of GSH and NADPH , which coincides with the upregulation of glycolytic metabolites including G 6 P . G 6 P shows indeed a rapid decrease until ∼ 10s before to increase again to eventually exceeds its initial value ( Figure 4C ) . 7 ∅ GSSG NADP + NADPH NADP + GAP F6P G6PD GLase 6PGD TKT1 PGI ALD TPI PFK FBPase PRPPs GAPDH ATP production HK RPE RPI TKT2 TLD H 2 O 2 A B C 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) 0 1 2 l o g 10 ( H 2 O 2 ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) 3 . 2 3 . 3 3 . 4 l o g 10 ( G S H ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) 0 0 . 5 1 l o g 10 ( N A D P H ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) 0 . 5 1 l o g 10 ( G 6 P ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) - 1 0 1 2 l o g 10 ( 6 P G L ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) 1 1 . 5 2 l o g 10 ( 6 P G ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) 1 1 . 5 2 l o g 10 ( R u 5 P ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) 0 1 2 l o g 10 ( X 5 P ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) 1 1 . 5 2 l o g 10 ( R 5 P ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) - 1 - 0 . 500 . 5 l o g 10 ( S 7 P ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) - 1 - 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 l o g 10 ( E 4 P ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) 1 2 3 l o g 10 ( G l c ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) - 0 . 200 . 20 . 40 . 6 l o g 10 ( F 6 P ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) 0 1 2 l o g 10 ( F B P ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) 0 . 60 . 811 . 21 . 4 l o g 10 ( D H A P ) 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) 2 2 . 5 3 l o g 10 ( G A P ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 Time ( s ) - 1 0 1 2 l o g 10 ( H 2 O 2 ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 Time ( s ) 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 l o g 10 ( G 6 P ) Figure 4 : Portrait of transient dynamic responses .

( B , C ) Dynamic response of H 2 O 2 and G 6 P until 100s , highlighting the multiphasic time course . The early decreasing phase of G 6 P dynamics coincides with an increased consumption through G 6 PD associated to higher NADP + levels while the late increasing phase can only be due to a decreased glycolytic ﬂux through PGI probably related to allosteric inhibition of glycolysis at the level of GAPD or PGI . 8 In summary , the biphasic response observed in simulations of the plausible set of models distinguishes between a detoxiﬁcation response in less than seconds using the reservoir of glutathione and cofactor NADPH and a metabolic rerouting response in tenth of seconds that involves inhibition of glycolysis to quickly restore high G6P levels .

Metabolic response to varying level of extracellular H 2 O 2 measured at 5mn ( full line ) and 30mn ( dashed line ) . ( A ) Dose response in the gluthatione pathway of H 2 O 2 H , GPx and GSH / GSSG ratio . ( B ) Dose response of 6 PG metabolite ( other metabolites are shown in Figure S4 ) . ( C ) Dose response of the elementary ﬂuxes through enzymatic reactions G 6 PD , TKT , GAPD and PRPP , and normalized to glucose import rate φ GLU . The redistribution pattern of metabolic ﬂuxes is determined for a speciﬁc level of H 2 O 2 for which 13 C labeling data were available . The OxPPP ﬂux normalized to glucose import ﬂux , Φ G 6 PD / Φ GLU , is distributed around 1 ( Figure 2A ) which is far below its maximal ﬂux capacity associated to full inhibition of GAPD and PRPP en - zyme ( i . e . , Φ G 6 PD / Φ GLU ≤ 6 ) . We therefore perform a dose - response analysis of the kinetic model ensemble P opt focusing respectively on the antioxidant response , concentration response and ﬂux response ( Figure 5 ) . Simulation of the metabolic response at 5mn as function of the extracellular level of H 2 O 2 shows a transition in the detoxi - ﬁcation response around 500 µM ( Figure 5A ) . Below this value , the detoxiﬁcation activity of GPx increases with oxidative stress level thereby keeping low intracellular levels of H 2 O 2 at the expense of an increased reduced state of glutathione . Above this value , GPx activity saturates such that metabolic ﬂux through this reaction is bounded and cannot increase anymore to compensate for the increase of H 2 O 2 production above some level . Beyond this threshold , H 2 O 2 is eliminated through catalase , consistently with the idea of that the rate - limiting enzymes depend on intracellular H 2 O 2 concentrations ( Makino et al . , 2004 ; Ng et al . , 2007 ) . Another qualitative change of the metabolic response is observed for large enough H 2 O 2 ( Figure 5B ) . 6 PG does not reach a steady state and continue to slowly increase , as values diﬀer between 5mn and 30mn . The appearance of a slower equilibration dynamics of 6 PG coincides with the saturated kinetics of 6 PGD enzymatic reaction associated to increased levels of 6 PG below that value of Km 6 PGD . In parallel to the concentration changes of H 2 O 2 and 6 PG , the dose response of 9 metabolic ﬂuxes displays a gradual change from a glycolytic mode to OxPPP mode up to a rather cycling mode ( Φ G 6 PD / Φ GLU ∼ 1 . 3 > 1 ) ( Figure 5C ) . In conclusion , dose - response analysis identiﬁes several rate - limiting mechanisms , where saturation in GPx re - strains H 2 O 2 detoxiﬁcation , while saturation in 6 PGD and leak ﬂux through PRPPs reactions restrains the maximal ﬂux into OxPPP for NADPH homeostasis . Naively , this limited ﬂux recycling can be interpreted as a need for nu - cleotid production for DNA repair and could be relieved through transcriptional regulation mechanism . Regulation analysis reveals both complementary and cooperative regulatory interplay The model comprises several regulatory mechanisms that can contribute to the metabolic ﬂux rerouting to oxidative stress . Some of these regulations directly act at the levels of reactions producing or consuming NADPH notably in OxPPP ( Ki G 6 PD , Ki 6 PGD , Ki NNH ) while others operate at the level of glycolysis ( Ki GAPD , Ki PGI ) . The estimated values of Ki provide an initial insight for the need of regulation to match kinetic model with experimental data . Computation of inhibitory strength X j / Ki j ( = 1 for enzymatic activity divided by two ) over the model ensemble P opt reveals that stress condition is associated with signiﬁcant inhibition of PGI and GAPD ( X j / Ki j (cid:29) 1 ) but also signiﬁcant disinhibition of G6PD ( Figure 6A ) . A more comprehensive strategy to quantify regulatory eﬀects consists in measuring gain - of - function or loss - of - function associated to the deletion of one of those regulatory mechanisms ( Ki i → ∞ ) , other things being equal . For such aim , we deﬁne a sensitivity quantity ∆ measuring the impact of some parameter change ( e . g . , lower allosteric inhibition ) on some functional output ( e . g . , intracellular H 2 O 2 ) ( Eq 4 ) . ∆ YKi →∞ = 1 indicates that deleting a regulation Ki has no phenotypic eﬀect while ∆ YKi →∞ larger or lower to 1 indicates that deleting the regulation increases or decreases the steady - state level of Y . In Figure 6B , removing NAPDH - dependent inhibition of G 6 PD or H 2 O 2 - dependent inhibition of GAPD leads to higher H 2 O 2 and lower NADPH , highlighting signiﬁcant contribution of these regulations for NADPH homeostasis and H 2 O 2 detoxiﬁcation . More surprisingly , deleting other regulation whose strength is not necessarily negligible has a minor impact on metabolic outputs of interest . However , the absence of eﬀect of deleting the 6PG - dependent inhibition of PGI can be interpreted by the reversibility of the enzymatic reaction where Φ + PGI ∼ Φ − PGI for this particular stress level ( Figure 2C ) . To investigate whether regulation eﬃciency depends on oxidative stress level , we evaluate how the deleterious eﬀect of removing a regulatory link ( i . e . , loss - of - function ) depends on extracellular hydrogen peroxide H ( Figure 6C - D ) . The dose - dependent proﬁle of ∆ H 2 O 2 Ki i ( H ) discriminates diﬀerent ranges of stress level for which each regulation Ki i is the most eﬃcient ( Figure 6C ) . First , the eﬃciency of G6PD upregulation is the highest for low - to - moderate stress level , probably because enzyme activity rather than G6P level is rate - limiting . Second , the eﬃciency of 6PG - dependent inhibition of PGI ( null for H = 500 in Fig . 6B ) peaks at intermediate stress level as it requires both ( i ) high enough stress for 6PG accumulation ( see Fig . 5B ) and ( ii ) not - too - high stress such that downstream ﬂux prevails over upstream ﬂux in PGI reaction ( Φ + PGI > Φ − PGI or equivalently Φ G 6 PD / Φ GLU < 1 ) ( see Fig . 5C ) . 10 A B C D Figure 6 : Regulation analysis based on gain / loss - of - function simulations .

The dose - speciﬁc areas of regulatory eﬀect associated to each deleted regulation ( ∆ ( H ) / ∆ max > 0 . 5 ) is shown upper to the panel . Sensitivity factor associated to key metabolite concentrations are shown in Figure S5 . ( D ) Sensitivity factor ∆ YP i with respect to combined deletion of two regulations in comparison to the single deletions . Third , the eﬃciency of GAPD inhibition culminates at high oxidative stress consistently with its ability , in addition to restore G6P levels , to reverse glycolytic ﬂux coming from the non - oxidative branch of the PPP , thus making possible a prevailing cycling mode where Φ G 6 PD / Φ GLU > 1 . Besides complementary eﬃciency ranges , two regulations can also combine their eﬀect in a non - trivial synergistic 11 or redundant manner . For instance , upregulation of G6PD enzyme enhances 6PG metabolite levels which poten - tializes inhibition of PGI . Alternatively , inhibition of PGI activity reduces consumption of G6P so as to potentialize the upregulation of G6PD . These are second - order eﬀects that are quantiﬁed by the computation of sensitivity factors ∆ YKi j , Ki k →∞ associated to the combined deletion of two regulations ( Figure 6D ) .

Sensitivity ∆ YX of output Y with respect to modulation of X ( Eq 4 ) as a function of extracellular H 2 O 2 , H , and the extent of parameter modulation . The output variable Y is either H 2 O 2 ( A , C , E ) and NADPH - producing ﬂux ( B , D , F ) and the modulated parameter is either k G 6 PD ( A , B ) , k 6 PGD ( C , D ) and k TKT ( E , F ) . G 6 PD , 6 PGD and TKT enzymes are common targets of loss - of - function experiments to investigate oxidative stress response ( Chan et al . , 2013 ; Kuehne et al . , 2015 ; N´obrega - Pereira et al . , 2016 ; Wan et al . , 2017 ; Sun et al . , 2019 ; Li et al . , 2019 ; Dubreuil et al . , 2020 ) . We therefore perform simulations of our model ensemble P opt while varying the enzymatic activity parameter from 10 - fold reduction to 10 - fold increase . We record both the mean 12 of H 2 O 2 , the NADPH - producing OxPPP ﬂux and some concentration metabolites for the model ensemble P opt ( Figure 7 ) . Expectedly , increase ( resp . , decrease ) of k G 6 PD leads to a more ( resp . , less ) eﬃcient oxidative stress response related to subsequent change in the OxPPP ﬂux of NADPH production ( Figure 7A , B ) . In sharp contrast , modulation of k 6 PGD leads to a more surprising and ambivalent metabolic response ( Figure 7C , D ) . Depending on the level of stress and of modulation , we observe that ( i ) both increase or decrease of k 6 PGD can weaken the oxidative stress response , and ( ii ) decrease of k 6 PGD can both weaken or improve oxidative stress response . These ambivalent phenotypes relate to the dual eﬀect of modulating k 6 PGD , on the G6PD enzymatic rate itself but also on the increase level of 6 PG that feedback on PGI activity , G6P level and G6PD ﬂux . Speciﬁcally , reducing k 6 PGD can lead to an imbalance state associated to increased metabolic ﬂux through 6PGD and decreased ﬂux through G6PD , whose relative eﬀect determines occurrence of loss or gain of function . Last , the modulation of k TKT has a moderate eﬀect on ﬂux reprogramming restricted to higher stress level ( Figure 7E , F ) , consistently with the dose - dependent increase of ﬂux in nonoxidative PPP ( Figure 5C ) and its crucial role for enabling a cycling ﬂux where φ G 6 PD / φ GLU > 1 . It is to note that some trends observed for the concentration response of glycolytic and PPP intermediates to modulation of k G 6 PD and k TKT ( Figure S6 ) are consistent with knockdown experiments ( Kuehne et al . , 2015 ) . Discussion Inference and analysis of kinetic models of metabolism shed new light on the regulation of the oxidative stress response . Kinetic modeling is a natural mechanistic framework to identify or investigate metabolite - enzyme in - teractions ( Link et al . , 2013 ; Machado et al . , 2015 ; Jahan et al . , 2016 ; Reznik et al . , 2017 ; Millard et al . , 2017 ; Christodoulou et al . , 2018 ) . In such framework , regulation patterns have rather been investigated in large - scale manner through ensemble modeling allowing both parameters and regulatory structure to vary ( Link et al . , 2013 ; Christodoulou et al . , 2018 ) or through metabolic control analysis ( Millard et al . , 2017 ) . Instead , the present study focuses on a restricted subset of metabolite - enzyme interactions proposed to contribute to oxidative stress response , by performing careful setting , inference and perturbation analysis of regulatory kinetics . Such middle ground approach is well - suited to highlight cooperative mechanisms in complex regulation patterns . A selected set of allosteric regulatory mechanisms is not only required to explain experimental data , but is also demonstrated to exhibit a complementary range of eﬃciency and pleiotropic roles associated to the ﬂux control of regulated reactions and concentration control of allosteric eﬀectors . These modes of cooperation could be understand from a metabolic control perspective as second - order eﬀects ( Liebermeister , 2013 ) , rather than those based on structural properties ( Stelling et al . , 2002 ; Notebaart et al . , 2008 ; Sajitz - Hermstein and Nikoloski , 2013 ; Nikerel et al . , 2012 ) , optimality properties Wessely et al . ( 2011 ) ; Chubukov et al . ( 2012 ) ; Berkhout et al . ( 2012 ) ; Pfeuty and Thommen ( 2016 ) or dynamical properties ( Krishna et al . , 2007 ; Grimbs et al . , 2007 ; Mulukutla et al . , 2015 ) of metabolic networks . 13 In the context of oxidative stress , metabolic regulation is important to quickly reallocate metabolic ﬂuxes to upregulate PPP - dependent production of NADPH as a cofactor of antioxidant enzymes ( Mullarky and Cantley , 2015 ; Stincone et al . , 2015 ; Dick and Ralser , 2015 ) . Although data analysis and previous models have shown the involvement of several regulatory mechanisms in the metabolic response ( Kuehne et al . , 2017 ; Christodoulou et al . , 2018 ) , the present results reﬁne our quantitative and mechanistic understanding of the contribution of regulation in the metabolic ﬂux rerouting toward OxPPP . For low oxidative stress , the prominent regulatory mechanism involves the relief of NADPH - dependent inhibition of G 6 PD to boost PPP increase for a given stress - dependent consumption rate of NADPH . However , this mechanism is weakened by the concomittant decrease of G6P when OxPPP ﬂuxes becomes of the order of downstream glycolytic ﬂux . For higher oxidative stress , eﬃcient upregulation of OxPPP ﬂuxes must therefore coincide with an inhibition of glycolytic consumption of G 6 P , such as through the inhibition of PGI , to maintain G 6 P levels and enhance PPP response . For more severe oxidative stress , H 2 O 2 - dependent inhibition of GAPD is the only regulatory mechanism capable to reverse the glycolytic ﬂux and allows for a cycling ﬂux mode while the inhibition of PGI becomes ineﬀective . Although these three regulatory mechanisms contribute the most for diﬀerent levels of intracellular H 2 O 2 , they nevertheless combine their eﬀect sometimes with signiﬁcant second - order synergy or redundancy eﬀects . This is typically the case when for instance a given regulatory mechanism impacts the concentration response of the allosteric eﬀectors of another regulatory mechanisms . These three key modes of regulation also diﬀer in the nature of allosteric regulators ( NADPH , 6 PG and H 2 O 2 ) and feedback mechanisms . While NADPH - dependent and H 2 O 2 - dependent regulations implement a negative - feedback driven homeostasis mechanisms , 6 PG - dependent inhibition of PGI generates a positive feedback mech - anism which are much less common in metabolic pathways than feedback inhibition ( Sauro , 2017 ; Alam et al . , 2017 ; Locasale , 2018 ) . Indeed , enhanced OxPPP ﬂux leads to increased 6 PG concentrations , such that stronger inhibition of PGI reduces G 6 P consumption and upregulates G 6 PD ﬂux . Although this allosteric regulation has been reported in various studies ( Gaitonde et al . , 1989 ; Kuehne et al . , 2015 ; Reznik et al . , 2017 ) , its functional role of this regulation has been seldomly debated ( Vaseghi et al . , 1999 ) . Positive feedback induced by 6 PG - dependent inhibition of PGI can lead to paradoxical behaviours in response to perturbation of 6 PGD enzyme . The inhibition of 6 PGD can ( i ) lower the maximal capacity ﬂux and restrict ﬂux usage for NADPH production , but can also ( ii ) further enhance 6 PG increases and concomittant inhibition of glycolysis diverting ﬂux into OxPPP . This ambivalent eﬀect explains the contradicting experimental observations where genetic or pharmacological inhibition of 6 PGD can either promote or decrease oxidative stress response depending on the context ( Sun et al . , 2019 ; Liu et al . , 2019 ; Dubreuil et al . , 2020 ) . Another hypothesis to explore is that such positive feedback mediated by the upregulation of PPP intermediates can support discrete changes of metabolic phenotypes involving for instance the activation of AMPK also regulated by 6PG and R5P ( Lin et al . , 2015 ; Gao et al . , 2019 ) From a methodological perspective , this modeling study relies on a systematic procedure for model inference and parameter estimation , which deliberately considers more parameters than data to provide the possibility to update 14 the probability distribution as additional data becomes available or as additional mechanistic hypothesis are tested . MCMC method is well adapted for such model updating procedure ( Beck and Au , 2002 ; Lau and Gandy , 2014 ) . Speciﬁcally , MCMC sampling can be restarted from a given parameter distribution with a modiﬁcation of the score function and of the sample space . By testing the predictive capacity of the model on dataset that are not included in the model inference procedure , we could indeed identify sparse phenotypes poorly described by the model . Adding the corresponding dataset the monte - carlo sampling procedure is found to slightly shift the parameter set of solution to be consistent with these new dataset . Monte - Carlo methods can be combined with machine learning techniques to address metabolic control and optimality functionalities ( Miskovic et al . , 2019 ) , providing an eﬃcient framework for model selection . Such ﬂexibility is valuable to extend our model to other model systems such as Erythrocytes ( Thorburn and Kuchel , 1985 ) or microbes ( Kerkhoven et al . , 2013 ; Christodoulou et al . , 2019 ) , to hour - timescale response involving transcriptional regulation ( Hayes and Dinkova - Kostova , 2014 ) or to other stress contexts such as glucose depletion and AMPK activation ( Jeon et al . , 2012 ; Lin et al . , 2015 ) . Materials and Methods Monte Carlo Markov Chain ( MCMC ) method Monte Carlo Markov Chain ( MCMC ) method is used for estimating the distribution of ( i ) metabolic ﬂux from 13 C labeling data and ( ii ) kinetic model parameters from concentration data and ﬂux estimation . These two computational problems are both deﬁned by a set of n p parameters (cid:126)θ , a set of n d data values (cid:126)y and a root mean square error r ( (cid:126)θ , (cid:126)y ) measuring the diﬀerence between data predicted by the parameters and the actual data ( see Eqs 2 and 3 ) . MCMC simulation methods use Monte Carlo sampling techniques to build Markov chains that converge to the posterior distribution of parameters θ associated to data Y . For both problems , we consider a bounded uniform distribution for the prior ( see supplementary Table S2 ) . For sampling , a Metropolis - Hasting algorithm is used to generate the random walk Markov chain based on ( i ) a gaussian jumping distribution and ( ii ) an acceptance rate function α that is the ratio of likelihood associated to the next parameter state and actual parameter state . Typically , the likelihood function can be written based on the expected or assumed distribution of observed data , as L ( Y , θ ) = ( 2 πσ ) − n / 2 exp ( − nr 2 2 σ 2 ) . Speciﬁcally , we use the acceptance rate α = min ( 1 , exp ( − r 2 i + 1 − r 2 i 2 σ 2 ) ) where the variances of jumping distribution and likelihood function σ are chosen to provide reasonable acceptance rate ( > 10 % ) and convergence rate . SSA - based 13 C - MFA Stochastic simulation algorithm ( SSA ) for 13 C - MFA is a direct method for the forward simulation problem to compute the dynamics and steady state of ( mass ) isotopomer distribution in isotopic labeling networks ( Thommen et al . , 2022 ) . From a given ﬂux distribution (cid:126) φ and initial labeling state , SSA computes the temporal evolution of 15 isotopomer numbers which are pooled to obtain the mass isotopomer distribution m i , j of species j . The sample size parameter of the algorithm is Ω = 100 . From the experimental values of mass isotopomer m ki , j , exp measured for n j = 7 species j in n k = 4 labeling conditions k ( Kuehne et al . , 2015 ) , SSA is performed iteratively using a MCMC sampling method based on a random walk Metropolis algorithm for obtaining the posterior distribution of ﬂux parameters . In such ﬂux estimation procedure , the root mean square error function is given by : RMSE ( (cid:126)φ ) = (cid:115) 1 N m (cid:88) i , j , k (cid:16) m ki , j , sim ( (cid:126)φ , t ) − m ki , j , exp ( t ) (cid:17) 2 , ( 2 ) where the measurement time is t = 10mn and the number of experiments is N m = n i n j n k = 84 . Kinetic model parameter estimation The parameter estimation problem consists in scoring parameter set (cid:126)p in the restricted parameter space P ∗ using a normalized root mean square error ( nRMSE ) : nRMSE ( (cid:126)p ∈ P ∗ ) = (cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:116) 1 N R + N Φ   (cid:88) i = 1 , N R (cid:18) R i , sim ( (cid:126)p ) − R i , exp ∆ R i , exp (cid:19) 2 + (cid:88) i = 1 , N φ (cid:18) Φ i , sim ( (cid:126)p ) − Φ i , exp ∆Φ i , exp (cid:19) 2   , ( 3 ) where R i = log 2 ( X i ( H = 500 ) X i ( H = 0 ) ) are concentration ratio in log scale and Φ i are the estimated ﬂux of reaction i in basal condition and in stress condition . Experimental data consists in N R = 12 and N Φ = 13 values of concentration ratio R i and estimated ﬂux Φ i with a standard deviation ∆ R i = 1 and ∆Φ i that is estimated from 13 C - MFA . This error function is used ﬁrst with a population - based metaheuristic algorithm called evolution strategy to quickly explore and sample local solutions . Starting with a pool of N I = 20 parameter vectors of random values ( bounded uniform distribution ) , the algorithm involves three steps : ( i ) a reproduction step where a parent is randomly selected to be duplicated without applying any ﬁtness criterion at this stage , and to generate N I oﬀspring ; ( ii ) a mutation step where the parameters of each oﬀspring are modiﬁed with a probability p m through multiplication by a factor 10 r , where r ∈ [ − a m , a m ] is a random number of uniform distribution ; ( iii ) a selection step where the nRMSE of the N I oﬀspring are evaluated , and only the N I highest - ﬁtness individuals in the pool of 2 N I parameter sets ( parents and oﬀspring ) are selected to generate the parents of the next generation . Finally , the optimization process terminates after a maximal number of generations ( N G = 10 4 ) where a local minima of nRMSE ( (cid:126)p ) is usually reached . This evolution is repeated for a broad set of random initial conditions to obtain a ﬁrst set of optimized models , some of which satisﬁes the plausibility criteria nRMSE < 1 . The lowest - nRMSE model (cid:126)p 1 is used as initial condition of a MCMC algorithm used to sample a posterior probabilistic distribution of parameters . After a transient , a sample of 10 6 accepted values are recorded to converge to a representative model ensemble associated to quasi - stationary distributions , while a random subsample of 10 5 models is used for statistical analysis of model behaviors . 16 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity quantities are deﬁned to evaluate the eﬀect of parameter changes on stress response behaviors . A model ensemble is deﬁned by a set of model (cid:126)p j = 1 , n M . For a given kinetic model of parameter values (cid:126)p j , a parameter p ji is multiplied by a factor ∆ p i . A sensitivity factor that informs about the impact of a given parameter p i on the output state variable Y in response to an extracellular level of hydrogen peroxide H is given by : ∆ Yp i ( H , ∆ p i ) = 1 N (cid:88) j Y ( H , (cid:126)q j ) Y ( H , (cid:126)p j ) , ( 4 ) where q ji = ∆ p i p ji and n M the number of model samples . The choice of parameter p i and variation ∆ p i are selected to evaluate the impact of a regulatory mechanism ( i . e . , p i are inhibitory parameters Ki i and ∆ p i = ∞ ) or to mimmic overexpression or knockdown experiments ( i . e . , p i are enzymatic activity rates k i and 0 . 1 < ∆ p i < 10 ) .
