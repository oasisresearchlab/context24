ABSTRACT 34 35 INTRODUCTION 36 The Limb Symmetry Index ( LSI ) , computed from kinetic parameters , tracks knee functionality post 37 Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction ( ACLR ) . However , LSI may lack accuracy in 38 individuals with ACLR and ankle sprains , as it overlooks kinetic chain coordination across lower 39 limb joints . Previous ankle sprains ( AS ) contribute to altered neuromuscular control in ACLR , 40 emphasizing the need to evaluate within - limb coordination during bilateral tasks to prevent 41 secondary ACL injuries . The effect of Energy Absorption Contribution ( EAC ) on joint work 42 provides insight into the coordination between joints during observed movements . Thus , the 43 purpose of this study was to validate a novel LSI based on EAC for discriminating movement 44 strategies in bilateral drop vertical jump landing ( DVJL ) among individuals with ACLR and ACLR - 45 AS 46 47 METHODS 48 39 healthy athletes , including 13 healthy controls , 13 ACLR , and 13 ACLR - AS were matched by 49 age , height , weight , sex , sports involvement , and limb dominance . Participants performed five 50 DVJLs with kinematics and ground reaction forces recorded . Individual joint work ( M ) and EAC 51 were calculated and averaged across the middle three trials to compute the LSI on individual joint 52 work ( LSI M ) and EAC ( LSI EAC ) . Negative LSI indicates asymmetry toward the nonsurgical limb , 53 while positive LSI indicates asymmetry toward the surgical limb . A 3x2x3 repeated measures 54 analysis of variance was utilized to analyze interactions between groups , the LSI method , and 55 joint . Tukey’s LSD post - hoc analyses were used to examine within and between groups 56 ( alpha = 0 . 05 ) . 57 58 RESULTS 59 There was a significant interaction between the group , LSI method , and joint ( F 4 , 72 = 3 . 216 , 60 P = . 017 ) . LSI EAC identified significant loading asymmetry at the hip ( P = . 046 ) and knee ( P = . 015 ) 61 when compared to healthy controls . 62 63 CONCLUSIONS 64 LSI EAC proved to be the method capable of distinguishing group differences in loading asymmetry 65 at the hip and knee for the ACLR - AS group compared to healthy controls during bilateral DVJL . 66 Overall , LSI EAC provided a more comprehensive insight into the movement strategies employed 67 during DVJL , particularly for individuals with ACLR and ACLR - AS . This emphasizes its suitability 68 for effectively monitoring the rehabilitation progression post ACLR towards RTS . Our findings 69 suggest that clinicians should prioritize computing the LSI based on EAC and assessing the 70 history of ankle sprains for precise RTS decision - making . This approach not only aids in 71 identifying loading asymmetry at the knee and hip but also underscores the critical importance of 72 restoring modified movement strategies in adolescents with ACLR - AS , ultimately reducing the 73 risk of secondary ACL injury following RTS . 74 75 All rights reserved .

An estimated 23 , 000 ankle sprains occur each day , and up to 78 73 % , of individuals with lateral ankle sprains experience repetitive ankle sprains , leading to the 79 emergence of chronic ankle instability ( CAI ) . 1 – 3 Similarly , the annual incidence of ACL tears in 80 the United States is reported to be 200 , 000 cases , with ACL reconstruction ( ACLR ) required in 81 90 % of these cases . 4 Notably , individuals who have undergone ACLR face a sixfold increased 82 risk of experiencing secondary ACL injuries within the initial 24 months following their return - to - 83 sports ( RTS ) . The prevalence rate of a second ACL injury remains as high as 31 % , particularly 84 among adolescents . 4 85 Previous research has suggested a potential link between CAI and ACLR . 5 , 6 Indeed , 86 52 % to 60 % of individuals experiencing an ACL injury reportedly had prior encounters with 87 ankle sprains . 5 , 6 Anchored in the tenets of the lower extremity kinetic chain , individuals with CAI 88 exhibit compensatory neuromuscular and biomechanical modifications at both the knee and the 89 hip . 7 – 16 During jump landing tasks , those with CAI demonstrated diminished knee flexion and 90 increased hip flexion angles in the affected limb during jump landing tasks in comparison to 91 healthy individuals and copers , who have a history of ankle sprains but did not develop CAI , 92 respectively . 8 , 9 Similarly , individuals with ACLR exhibit distinct landing patterns characterized by 93 increased knee extension and reduced peak knee flexion moments , suggesting potential 94 underloading of the surgical limb . 17 95 Asymmetry in landing kinetics and kinematics , especially during a bilateral drop vertical 96 jump landing , following ACLR , is identified as a significant risk factor for both initial and 97 secondary ACL injuries . 4 , 18 While much of the research focused on adults , a recent systematic 98 review indicated that similar asymmetries exist in adolescents . 18 , 19 These asymmetries include a 99 reduced knee extension moment and vertical ground reaction force in the surgical limb during 100 double - limb landing compared to the nonsurgical limb . 17 , 18 Consequently , limb asymmetry index 101 All rights reserved .

This oversight could potentially contribute to the occurrence of 105 secondary ACL injuries , especially in ACLR individuals with a history of ankle sprains . 106 In the study conducted by Sigward et al . ( 2018 ) 21 , they examined the loading strategy 107 employed during bilateral squatting at 3 - and 5 - months post - ACLR . The findings revealed that 108 individuals with ACLR exhibited a combination of inter - and intra - limb compensations at 3 109 months . 21 This involved shifting load from the surgical to the nonsurgical limb and redistributing 110 load to the hip within the surgical limb . 21 However , at 5 months post - ACLR , those with ACLR 111 predominantly relied on intra - limb compensation , shifting load from the knee to the hip within the 112 surgical limb . 21 Robinson et al . ( 2022 ) 22 identified a similar trend in adolescent athletes when 113 investigating energy absorption contribution ( EAC ) at RTS . The EAC , evaluating the energy 114 expended at each joint during a given task by combining both kinematic ( joint angular velocity ) 115 and kinetic ( net joint moment ) data , was applied to scrutinize intra - limb loading across multiple 116 joints ( ankle , knee , hip ) . Notably , adolescent athletes with ACLR exhibited intra - limb 117 compensation at the hip in the surgical limb by shifting the load from the knee . 22 Additionally , 118 there was intra - limb load - sharing compensation between the hip and knee and underloading of 119 the ankle in the nonsurgical limb during DVJL . 22 120 Our innovative approach , utilizing EAC instead of the conventional method of utilizing 121 kinematic and kinetic data solely at the knee in the computation of LSI during DVJL , provides 122 enriched insights by comprehensively considering both inter - and intra - limb compensations . 123 This method has the potential to enhance the decision - making process for RTS , thereby 124 reducing the risk of secondary ACL injuries . Consequently , the purpose of this study was to 125 examine the efficacy of our novel approach in analyzing joint loading asymmetry based on EAC 126 compared to the conventional approach in distinguishing loading asymmetry during DVJL in 127 All rights reserved .

Eligible participants , aged between 13 and 25 135 years , were enlisted based on their involvement in either a level 1 ( e . g . , basketball , football , 136 soccer ) or level 2 ( softball , baseball ) sport . For the ACLR and ACLR - AS groups , inclusion 137 criteria required individuals to have sustained a first - time ACL injury , with specific exclusion 138 criteria that excluded those with full - thickness chondral defects , grade II or III medial , lateral , or 139 posterior collateral ligament injuries . Participants in the healthy control group were included if 140 they had no active lower - extremity orthopedic injuries and had not experienced any injuries 141 within the last three months . 142 All participants were carefully matched by age , weight , height , sex , sports involvement , 143 and limb dominance in terms of ACLR . Participants’ surgical limb was defined as the limb with 144 ACLR with and without a history of ankle sprains , and healthy controls were assigned a surgical 145 limb based on their matched participant . If the participant’s surgical limb was dominant limb , the 146 dominant limb ( the limb participants would choose to kick a ball with ) of healthy individuals was 147 identified as the surgical limb and vice versa for the nonsurgical limb and nondominant limb . 148 Upon enrollment , each participant completed a demographic information sheet included 149 details about injury history and sports participation . Informed consent , and for minors , parental 150 consent along with child assent , were obtained from all participants . Additionally , all participants 151 were part of a larger ongoing study examining clinical outcomes across the continuum of care , 152 investigating movement profiles . 153 All rights reserved .

Thirty - three reflective markers were placed to each participant ' s skin and 157 clothing using double - sided tape to track bony landmarks , including spinous process of the 158 seventh cervical vertebra , twelfth thoracic vertebra , between the fourth and fifth lumbar 159 vertebrae , sternum , bilateral acromion process , anterior superior iliac spine , posterior superior 160 iliac spine , greater trochanter , anterior mid - thigh , medial and lateral femoral epicondyles , 161 anterior mid - shank , medial and lateral malleoli , calcaneus , and first and fifth metatarsal heads . 162 Three additional retroreflective markers were attached on the sacrum as a cluster . Two AMIT 163 ( Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc . , Watertown , MA ) force plates , operating at 1200 Hz , 164 were used to acquire joint kinetics . 165 Drop Vertical Jump Landing : 166 Participants underwent three trials of a drop vertical jump - landing ( DVJL ) task , following 167 the protocol outlined by DiStefano et al . ( 2015 , 2018 ) 23 , 24 and Ward et al . ( 2018 ) 25 . The initiation 168 involved standing on a box positioned at 50 % of their height from the force plate . The JL task 169 comprised two double - leg jumps : a forward jump from a 30 cm box onto both legs , followed 170 immediately by a vertical jump for maximal height , as detailed by Padua et al . ( 2009 ) 26 . Trials 171 where participants failed to reach the force plate or executed the take - off with a single foot were 172 excluded from the analysis . 173 Isokinetic Testing : 174 The Biodex Multi - Joint Testing and Rehabilitation System ( Biodex Medical Systems , 175 Shirley , NY ) was employed for isokinetic testing to assess extensor peak torque , referred to as 176 quadriceps strength . The testing velocity was set at 60 degrees per second ( 60 deg / s ) . 177 Participants were seated on the Biodex system and securely fastened with padded straps 178 around the thigh , pelvis , and torso .

The alignment of the femoral condyle of 180 the test limb followed the Biodex axis of rotation , as per the manufacturer ' s instructions . To 181 familiarize participants with the testing motion , five submaximal knee extension / flexion 182 repetitions were performed . Subsequently , participants executed five consecutive concentric 183 contractions to measure quadriceps strength at 60 deg / s . Testing commenced on the 184 nonsurgical limb , followed by the surgical limb . For consistency , extensor peak torque was 185 referred to as quadriceps strength . The mean of the five trials for each limb was normalized to 186 body weight for subsequent data analysis . 187 Data Processing and Reduction : 188 For kinematic and kinetic data processing , Qualisys system - exported data were 189 processed in Visual 3D , involving filtering with a Butterworth filter ( 12 Hz cutoff frequency ) . 190 Lower extremity joint angles were determined via an inverse kinematic approach , and lower 191 extremity internal moment was calculated with an inverse dynamic approach . Knee joint Energy 192 Absorption was calculated by integrating the negative portion of the scalar power curve , 193 normalized to height and weight and averaged across three trials . Joint EAC at each joint 194 ( ankle , knee , hip ) was computed as a percentage of the total limb energy absorption ( equation 195 1 ) . The average of individual joint work and Energy Absorption Coefficient ( EAC ) was calculated 196 across the central three trials to determine the LSI for both joint work ( Equation 2 ) and EAC 197 ( Equation 3 ) . A negative LSI denotes asymmetry favoring the surgical limb , while a positive LSI 198 signifies asymmetry favoring the nonsurgical limb . 199 EAC ( joint ) = !

A one - way analysis of variance was examined to compare participant characteristics 205 ( age , weight , weight , quads strength on the surgical and the nonsurgical limbs ) among the 206 groups ( healthy controls , ACLR , ACLR - AS ) . Before conducting statistical analyses , normality 207 and outliers in the kinetic data were examined . A 3 ( group ) × 2 ( LSI methods ) × 3 ( joints ) mixed - 208 design repeated - measures analysis of variance was employed , with an alpha level set at 0 . 05 , 209 to examine how computing LSI with different methods at individual joints ( ankle , knee , hip ) 210 differs among the three groups . Tukey’s LSD post - hoc analyses were used in the case of a 211 significant interaction . In the presence of significant post - hoc pairwise comparisons , Cohen’s d 212 effect size ( ES ) values were calculated , with categories defined as weak ( ≤0 . 40 ) , moderate 213 ( 0 . 40 – 0 . 80 ) , and strong ( ≥0 . 80 ) , along with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals between 214 the group means to assess the magnitude of difference in LSI methods and joints . 27 215 Results : 216 Table 1 displays an overview of the participant characteristics within each group . There 217 was a significant interaction between the group , LSI method , and joint ( F 4 , 72 = 3 . 216 , P = . 017 ) . 218 LSI EAC identified significant loading asymmetry at the hip ( P = . 046 ) and knee ( P = . 015 ) when 219 compared to healthy controls ( Table 2 ) . 220 Discussion 221 The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of our novel approach in 222 contrast to traditional methods utilizing joint moment to discriminate joint loading asymmetry 223 during DVJL among adolescent athletes with ACLR and ACLR - AS compared to healthy 224 controls . The most important finding of the study was that group differences in joint loading 225 asymmetry depended on both joint ( hip , knee , ankle ) and LSI computational methods ( LSI EAC , 226 LSI M ) . The pairwise comparisons demonstrated that only LSI EAC effectively identified group 227 differences in joint loading asymmetry at the hip and knee in adolescent athletes with ACLR - AS 228 compared to healthy controls at RTS .

These collective findings indicate that LSI EAC accurately 232 discriminates loading asymmetry at the hip and knee in adolescent athletes with ACLR - AS at 233 RTS . 234 To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study that compares a novel exploration of 235 loading asymmetry and a conventional approach in ACLR adolescents with and without a 236 history of ankle sprains . Prior investigations have predominantly focused on knee kinetics and 237 kinematics during bilateral DVJL at RTS . 18 These studies consistently identified limb asymmetry 238 in parameters such as peak knee extension moment , peak vertical ground reaction force 239 ( vGRF ) , knee energy absorption , and peak knee flexion in the nonsurgical limb . 17 , 28 – 30 240 Adolescents with ACLR employ a compensatory strategy by underloading the surgical limb 241 compared to the nonsurgical limb . 18 While the current study did not conduct direct within - group 242 comparisons for limb asymmetry , the directional limb asymmetry identified through LSI M aligns 243 with previous research . Specifically , across all groups , there was an almost consistent strategy 244 of underloading the surgical limb in the ACLR and ACLR - AS groups , as well as underloading an 245 assigned surgical limb ( nondominant limb ) in healthy controls . 246 There were a limited number of prior studies examining limb asymmetry , including 247 healthy controls , and they did not explicitly investigate group differences compared to the ACLR 248 group . Paterno et al . ( 2011 ) 31 found no limb asymmetry in peak vGRF , while Mueske et al . 249 ( 2018 ) 32 identified reduced knee flexion in the nonsurgical limb ( nondominant limb ) than in the 250 surgical limb ( dominant limb ) in healthy controls . Limb dominance has been proposed to 251 positively impact limb asymmetry of the knee extensor strength , indicating smaller strength 252 deficits in those individuals who underwent ACLR in their dominant limb ( Zumstien et al . , 253 2022 ) . 33 In our study , both adolescent athletes with ACLR and ACLR - AS exhibited nearly equal 254 numbers of adolescent athletes who sustained ACLR in their dominant limb ( N = 6 ) and those in 255 All rights reserved .

Furthermore , there were no significant differences in quadriceps 256 strength among all three groups in our study ( Table 1 ) . The conventional method for computing 257 LSI doesn’t consider inter - limb compensation at the hip and ankle . Consequently , there is a 258 potential for LSIM to overestimate joint function at RTS , thereby contributing to a secondary 259 ACL injury . 30 The collective absence of identified group differences in limb asymmetry at the hip , 260 knee , and ankle may stem from movement strategies implemented in other joints of the kinetic 261 chain that LSIM is not designed to detect . 262 Our novel approach , diverging from the conventional method to compute LSI ( LSI M ) , 263 involves computing LSI based on EAC ( LSI EAC ) . Based on the work of Sigward et al . , ( 2018 ) 21 264 with the recognition that limb asymmetry is more prevalent in kinetic rather than kinematic 265 variables among ACLR individuals , LSI EAC entails the computation of EAC . This process utilizes 266 both kinetic and kinematic data to assess the energy contributions from the hip , knee , and ankle 267 during DVJL , emphasizing inter - limb compensation . 21 Sigward et al . ( 2018 ) 21 delved into the 268 loading strategy adopted during bilateral squatting at 3 - and 5 - month intervals post - ACLR . 21 The 269 results highlighted a blend of inter - and intra - limb compensations at the 3 - month mark among 270 those who underwent ACLR , involving load transfer from the surgical to the nonsurgical limb 271 and redistribution within the surgical limb . 21 By the 5 - month post - ACLR mark , a predominant 272 shift to intra - limb compensation occurred , with the load shifting from the knee to the hip within 273 the surgical limb . 21 Accordingly , the application of EAC to compute LSI EAC in our study unveiled 274 limb asymmetry at the hip and knee in the ACLR - AS group , distinguishing them from both the 275 ACLR group and healthy controls . 276 The absence of limb asymmetry at the ankle in adolescent athletes with ACLR - AS and 277 the lack of limb asymmetry compared to healthy controls and the ACLR group were unexpected 278 findings . Typically , limb asymmetry persists for approximately 8 to 12 months after ACLR but 279 tends to diminish over time post - ACLR . 34 At the time of RTS , individuals with ACLR with weaker 280 quadriceps strength are known to exhibit altered landing patterns , whereas those with nearly 281 All rights reserved .

However , it is important to note that 285 distal changes caused by ankle sprains may have a significant impact on proximal joint 286 kinematics in individuals with ACLR - AS . 287 Individuals experiencing multiple ankle sprains , such as CAI , demonstrate 288 neuromuscular alterations at the knee and hip . Specifically , individuals with a history of ankle 289 sprains show reduced knee flexion angles and increased hip flexion angles in the affected limb 290 during jump landing tasks . 8 , 10 Moreover , those with a history of ankle sprains had increased 291 general joint laxity and genu recurvatum . 5 , 6 The current evidence suggests there is a 292 relationship between a history of prior ankle sprains and ACL injuries in athletes . 5 , 6 Indeed , 52 to 293 60 % of individuals who sustained an ACL injury had a prior ipsilateral ankle sprain . 5 , 6 Earlier 294 studies that observed limb asymmetry at RTS did not investigate the history of ankle sprains in 295 their participants with ACLR . Therefore , it is plausible that those with ACLR displaying persistent 296 limb asymmetry at the time of RTS had a history of ankle sprains , impacting their movement 297 strategies and loading patterns compared to individuals with ACLR . Overall , LSI EAC was 298 sensitive enough to detect subtle differences in limb asymmetry , particularly in athletes with 299 ACLR - AS . 300 Clinical Implications 301 The risk of secondary ACL injury remains high , particularly among adolescents , with a 302 prevalence rate reaching up to 31 % . 4 Limb asymmetry in landing kinetics and kinematics , 303 particularly evident in a bilateral DVJL after ACLR , is acknowledged as a significant risk factor 304 for secondary ACL injuries . 28 This increased risk could be linked to overestimated limb 305 asymmetry utilizing conventional LIS based on kinematic and kinetic data solely at the knee in 306 the computation of LSI to make RTS decisions .

This 312 approach not only facilitates the identification of limb asymmetry at the knee and hip but also 313 emphasizes the importance of restoring modified movement strategies in adolescents with 314 ACLR - AS . This emphasis is crucial for preventing the occurrence of secondary ACL injury 315 following RTS . 316 Limitations 317 The study sample includes adolescents and an athletic population , indicating possible 318 constraints in extending these results to older or less active cohorts . Moreover , we lack 319 information on the number of prior ankle sprains , the duration since the last ankle sprain , or any 320 history of additional lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries that could potentially impact limb 321 asymmetry during DVJL . Finally , we did not match subjects by graft type , limiting our ability to 322 offer conclusive recommendations on the effects of graft type on limb asymmetry identified by 323 LSI EAC . 324 Conclusion : 325 LSI EAC proved to be the method capable of distinguishing group differences in loading 326 asymmetry at the hip and knee for the ACLR - AS group compared to healthy controls during 327 bilateral DVJL . Overall , LSI EAC provided a more comprehensive insight into the movement 328 strategies employed during DVJL , particularly for individuals with ACLR and ACLR - AS . This 329 emphasizes its suitability for effectively monitoring the rehabilitation progression post ACLR 330 towards RTS . Our findings suggest that clinicians should prioritize computing the LSI based on 331 EAC and assessing the history of ankle sprains for precise RTS decision - making . This approach 332 not only aids in identifying loading asymmetry at the knee and hip but also underscores the 333 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .
