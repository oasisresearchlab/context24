Internalization Mechanisms of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor after Activation with Different Ligands Lasse Henriksen , Michael Vibo Grandal ¤ , Stine Louise Jeppe Knudsen , Bo van Deurs , Lene Melsæther Grøvdal * Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine , University of Copenhagen , Copenhagen , Denmark Abstract The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) regulates normal growth and differentiation , but dysregulation of the receptor or one of the EGFR ligands is involved in the pathogenesis of many cancers . There are eight ligands for EGFR , however most of the research into trafficking of the receptor after ligand activation focuses on the effect of epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and transforming growth factor - a ( TGF - a ) . For a long time it was believed that clathrin - mediated endocytosis was the major pathway for internalization of the receptor , but recent work suggests that different pathways exist . Here we show that clathrin ablation completely inhibits internalization of EGF - and TGF - a - stimulated receptor , however the inhibition of receptor internalization in cells treated with heparin - binding EGF - like growth factor ( HB - EGF ) or betacellulin ( BTC ) was only partial . In contrast , clathrin knockdown fully inhibits EGFR degradation after all ligands tested . Furthermore , inhibition of dynamin function blocked EGFR internalization after stimulation with all ligands . Knocking out a number of clathrin - independent dynamin - dependent pathways of internalization had no effect on the ligand - induced endocytosis of the EGFR . We suggest that EGF and TGF - a lead to EGFR endocytosis mainly via the clathrin - mediated pathway . Furthermore , we suggest that HB - EGF and BTC also lead to EGFR endocytosis via a clathrin - mediated pathway , but can additionally use an unidentified internalization pathway or better recruit the small amount of clathrin remaining after clathrin knockdown .

It is involved in regulating growth and differentiation as well as in the pathogenesis of a number of cancers . The EGFR is activated upon ligand binding . Activation leads to internalization of the receptor and trafficking to the early endosomal compartment of the cell . From there the receptor can either be degraded via lysosomes or recycled to the cell surface depending on the ligand bound ( reviewed in [ 1 , 2 ] . Endocytic downregulation of the EGFR is an important mechanism of signal attenuation . So far eight ligands for EGFR have been described . These are epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , transforming growth factor - a ( TGF - a ) , heparin - binding EGF - like growth factor ( HB - EGF ) , betacellulin ( BTC ) , amphiregulin ( AR ) , epiregulin ( EPI ) , epigen and neuregulin2 - b [ 3 , 4 ] . Although EGFR is one of the most thoroughly studied RTKs , little is known about the different roles of the EGFR ligands . Until recently most of the studies on EGFR trafficking were performed using EGF - stimulation and a few using TGF - a - stimulation . These studies showed a difference in trafficking , where EGF leads to receptor degradation whereas TGF - a leads to recycling of the receptor [ 5 ] . This is caused by a difference in pH sensitivity , causing dissociation of TGF - a from EGFR in endosomes . EGF however , remains bound to EGFR [ 6 ] . Earlier we have described how EGFR endocytosis is differen - tially regulated by the various ligands [ 7 ] . EGF causes an intermediary amount of receptor internalization and degradation with some recycling of the receptor . HB - EGF - and BTC - stimulation lead to a strong induction of internalization and to degradation of a large portion of the internalized receptor . TGF - a and EPI lead to an intermediate internalization but an almost complete recycling . AR stimulation leads to receptor internaliza - tion , but the receptor did not readily return to the surface , possibly because of recycling via a slow recycling pathway . Until recently ligand - induced EGFR endocytosis was believed to be primarily clathrin - mediated . It has been reported that the ligand - induced receptor internalization has a relatively low capacity , thus the pathway is easily saturated [ 8 , 9 ] . In 2003 Hinrichsen and colleagues found that clathrin - knockdown with PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e58148 siRNA does not block EGFR uptake in cells [ 10 ] . Recently it was reported that the EGFR can be internalized by macropinocytosis in certain cell types [ 11 – 13 ] . Sigismund and colleagues reported that a clathrin - independent mechanism of endocytosis exists for the EGFR . They found that this endocytosis occurs after stimulation with high concentrations of EGF [ 14 , 15 ] . In contrast , results from our own group and collaborators indicate that EGF - stimulated receptor endocytosis can be completely abolished with clathrin knockdown [ 16 , 17 ] . Here we have investigated the internalization mechanisms of EGFR after addition of different ligands and inhibition of several endocytic pathways . Endocytosis of EGFR after treatment with all ligands could be inhibited to a certain degree by ablation of clathrin . However , after HB - EGF or BTC stimulation , internal - ization was not fully inhibited . Additionally we found that inhibition of dynamin function blocked internalization after stimulation with all ligands . However , inhibition of macropinocy - tosis , caveolin1 , RhoA , Arf6 , flotillin1 / 2 or raft - dependent path - ways did not have an effect on internalization of the EGFR . These data suggest that the more potent ligands HB - EGF and BTC could induce a so far unknown pathway of internalization or they could be better at utilizing the small amounts of clathrin remaining after knockdown . Results Clathrin Knockdown Fully Inhibits EGF - induced EGFR Internalization , but Internalization Upon HB - EGF and BTC Binding is Only Partly Inhibited To determine the dependency of EGFR internalization on clathrin after stimulation with the different ligands , the amount of cell surface receptor was measured after clathrin knockdown and addition of ligands . HeLa cells were treated with siRNA against clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) , and stimulated with 3 . 22 nM ligand for 15 minutes . For EGF this corresponds to 20 ng / ml , a concentration reported to induce both clathrin - mediated and clathrin - independent endocytosis of EGFR [ 14 ] . In cells treated with EGF or TGF - a , knockdown using either of 2 CHC siRNA sequences returned surface receptor levels to levels similar to those in unstimulated cells ( Figure 1A ) . In contrast , HB - EGF - and BTC - induced internalization was only partly inhibited by clathrin knockdown . In cells treated with clathrin siRNA and these ligands , surface EGFR levels were only increased to approximately 70 % of surface levels in unstimulated cells . 3 . 22 nM AR or EPI did not induce significant EGFR internalization . To further test for clathrin - dependency of ligand - induced internalization , we stimulated clathrin knockdown cells with concentrations of ligand previously shown to induce maximum levels of internalization [ 7 ] . HeLa cells were treated with 10 nM ( EGF , TGF - a , HB - EGF and BTC ) or 100 nM ligand ( AR and EPI ) for 15 minutes . As seen in Figure 1B , the effects of clathrin siRNA , were similar to those observed at lower ligand concentrations ( see Figure 1A ) . CHC knockdown using one siRNA sequence ( CHC1 ) blocked EGFR endocytosis , returning the surface receptor levels to those in unstimulated cells for EGF - and TGF - a - treated cells . The second siRNA sequence ( CHC2 ) was not as potent at this concentration , and therefore not used in further experiments . Thus , CHC1 siRNA is henceforth referred to as CHC siRNA . Stimulation with 100 nM AR or EPI led to receptor internalization and this internalization was significantly inhibited by clathrin knock - down . Receptor levels on the surface of cells treated with HB - EGF or BTC were also in this case only about 70 % of those on unstimulated cells . As AR and EPI are weak inducers of EGFR internalization unless used at very high concentrations , and also strongly dependent on clathrin for internalization , we chose to focus on EGF , TGF - a , HB - EGF and BTC for further studies . To investigate if these differences in receptor surface levels could be due to differences in EGFR recycling , internalization was also studied after only 5 minutes of ligand stimulation , reducing the contribution of recycling ( Figure 1C ) . After 5 minutes stimulation , internalization was significantly inhibited by clathrin siRNA for EGF and TGF - a . However , as observed at 15 minutes , inhibition was less efficient for HB - EGF and BTC stimulation . Combined , these results indicate that although clathrin knockdown fully inhibits internalization of EGFR after stimulation with EGF and TGF - a , a fraction of the receptors stimulated with HB - EGF or BTC is still internalized . Clathrin knockdown did not appear to affect EGFR levels ( Figure 1D ) . Clathrin Knockdown Abolishes EGF - induced EGFR Localization to Endosomes , Whereas HB - EGF - and BTC - induced Endosomal Localization is Only Partly Reduced To further study the clathrin - dependency of EGFR endocy - tosis , HeLa cells treated with siRNA against CHC were stimulated with 10 nM ligand for 15 minutes , as we have previously shown that maximum internalization is reached after 15 minutes stimulation with all ligands [ 7 ] . Cells were fixed and labeled for EGFR and the endosomal marker EEA1 . As seen in Figure 2 , clathrin knockdown largely abolished the co - localiza - tion between EGFR and EEA1 in cells stimulated with EGF or TGF - a , corresponding to the high EGFR surface levels observed in Figure 1 . In the two lower panels in Figure 2A , it is seen that EGFR still co - localizes with EEA1 in cells treated with clathrin siRNA when stimulated with HB - EGF or BTC . Thus , clathrin knockdown using siRNA does not fully inhibit internalization of EGFR into early endosomes , upon binding of HB - EGF or BTC . This suggests that the remaining internali - zation in clathrin knockdown cells observed in Figure 1 leads to sorting of the EGFR to early endosomes . EGFR Degradation is Inhibited by Clathrin Knockdown It has previously been reported that different mechanisms of internalization of the EGFR can lead to differences in receptor degradation [ 14 ] . Also , our earlier work has shown how different ligands led to a different fate for EGFR [ 7 ] . The observation that internalization of EGFR was differentially dependent on clathrin for the various EGFR ligands therefore led us to investigate how degradation of the EGFR is dependent on clathrin - mediated endocytosis after stimulation with the EGFR ligands . HeLa cells were treated with siRNA targeting CHC and stimulated with EGF , TGF - a or BTC for 0 – 3 hours . The cells were then lysed and EGFR levels were measured by ELISA . Figure 3 shows EGFR levels in cells treated with 10 nM ligand . Knockdown of clathrin inhibited degradation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF ( Figure 3A ) . TGF - a did not induce significant EGFR degradation ( Figure 3B ) . When cells were stimulated with BTC ( Figure 3C ) degradation was also strongly inhibited by clathrin siRNA . Thus degradation of EGFR after addition of ligand seems to be dependent on clathrin for all 3 ligands . This indicates that the internalization of BTC - stimulated EGFR in clathrin knockdown cells leads to sorting to early endosomes . However , here the receptor is no longer sorted for degradation . We therefore set out to investigate if another mechanism of internalization could be involved in EGFR endocytosis upon stimulation with HB - EGF and BTC . EGFR Internalization Mechanisms PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e58148 The Macropinocytosis Inhibitor Amiloride does not Inhibit EGFR Internalization It has been reported that EGF concentrations of 100 – 200 ng / ml ( corresponding to 16 . 1 – 32 . 2 nM ) can induce macropinocytosis in A431 and MCF7 cells [ 12 , 13 ] , and that EGF treatment induces EGFR uptake by circular ruffling in NR6 , COS7 and PANC1 cells [ 11 ] . To investigate if HB - EGF and BTC could induce EGFR internalization via macropinocytosis in HeLa cells , we used the macropinocytosis inhibitor amiloride [ 12 ] . Cells were incubated with 1 mM amiloride before stimulation with 10 nM of EGF , TGF - a , HB - EGF or BTC for 15 minutes . Cell surface receptor levels were determined by flow cytometry . Figure 4A shows that amiloride has no effect on EGFR receptor internalization for either of the ligands , indicating that HB - EGF or BTC - stimulation does not induce receptor internalization by macropinocytosis in HeLa cells . EGFR levelsdidnotappeartobeaffectedbyamiloridtreatment ( Figure4B ) . In Figure 4C it can be seen that amiloride inhibits uptake of a fluorescent dextran into NIH - 3T3 cells demonstrating that the amiloride indeed inhibits macropinocytosis . EGFR Internalization after Ligand Binding is Dependent on Dynamin for All Ligands Having seen that macropinocytosis does not appear to be involved in HB - EGF - or BTC - induced internalization , we wanted to investigate how the internalization depends on dynamin . For this purpose , HeLa cells stably transfected with the dynamin K44A dominant negative mutant in an inducible tet - off system were grown without tetracycline for 48 hours to induce expression of the dynamin mutant . The cells were then treated with ligand and the cell surface EGFR levels were determined using flow cytometry . Figure 5A shows that expression of the dominant negative dynamin returns surface EGFR levels to that of unstimulated cells for all ligands , indicating that endocytosis of the receptor is dynamin - dependent regardless of ligand . Figure 5B + C shows that internalization of both radiolabeled transferrin and EGF is inhibited after 48 hours of dynamin K44A induction . Cholesterol - interference with the Drug Filipin does not Inhibit EGFR Internalization As many clathrin - independent pathways of endocytosis involve the presence of rafts [ 18 , 19 ] and interference with cholesterol has been reported to inhibit EGFR internalization [ 14 ] , we in - vestigated if treatment with the cholesterol - sequestering drug filipin could inhibit receptor internalization after HB - EGF and BTC stimulation . HeLa cells were treated with 1 m g / ml filipin 1 hour prior to stimulation with 10 nM ligand for 15 minutes . Remaining receptors on the cell surface were measured using flow cytometry . Figure 6A shows that filipin does not inhibit EGFR Figure 1 . EGFR internalization after clathrin knockdown .

It has been demonstrated that EGFR co - localizes with caveolin after stimulation with EGF [ 15 ] . Similarly , co - localization is seen between the TGF - b receptor and caveolin [ 20 ] . It has also been shown that when loaded with virus particles , caveolae can be downregulated in a dynamin - dependent manner [ 21 , 22 ] . To investigate if HB - EGF and BTC stimulation induces caveolin - dependent receptor endocytosis , caveolin1 was ablated in HeLa cells , using siRNA . Figure 4 .

Cell surface receptor levels were measured by flow cytometry . Knockdown of caveolin1 had no effect on the cell surface levels of EGFR after ligand stimulation ( Figure 7 ) , thus indicating that the protein is not involved in BTC - or HB - EGF - induced EGFR endocytosis . Knockdown of caveolin1 did not appear to affect EGFR levels ( Figure 7B ) . Discussion The internalization of EGFR has until recently been considered a textbook example of clathrin - dependent endocytosis , with receptor phosphorylation driving the internalization . Endocytosis of the receptor was considered to be purely a mechanism for attenuating signaling . Recent studies have suggested that EGFR endocytosis might not be as straightforward as was first believed , with the presence of many mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis , and the need for internalization for full activation of signaling pathways [ 11 , 14 , 15 , 23 , 24 ] . These studies , combined with our knowledge of the differential intracellular trafficking of EGFR after stimulation with its different ligands [ 7 ] , stresses the need for a better understanding of how the different ligands affect EGFR in - ternalization , sorting and signaling . In this study we found that ligand - induced EGFR internalization in our system was de - pendent on clathrin , but to a different degree depending on the ligand used ( Figure 1 ) . EGF - , TGF - a - , AR - and EPI - induced internalization was almost completely inhibited by clathrin knockdown , whereas HB - EGF - and BTC - induced internalization was only partly inhibited . Figure 5 . EGFR internalization in the HeLa dynamin K44A cell line . A : K44A dynamin expression was induced by removal of tetracycline from the medium for 48 hours . Cells were incubated with 10 nM ( EGF , TGF - a , HB - EGF , BTC ) or 100 nM ( AR , EPI ) ligand for 15 minutes at 37 u C .

These studies all use HeLa cells , but the different results could very well be the result of clonal differences : Differences in the expression levels of proteins involved in EGFR internalization could contribute to the differences in internalization pathways used between cell lines . In fact , gene expression analysis have revealed large differences in the gene expression profiles of the HeLa cell lines used in these studies ( personal communication , Pier Paolo Di Fiore ) . We found that HB - EGF - and BTC - induced EGFR internali - zation could not be fully inhibited by clathrin knockdown ( Figure 1 ) . This could indicate that HB - EGF - and BTC - stimulation induce internalization via a clathrin - independent pathway . As BTC and HB - EGF are more potent inducers of EGFR activation than EGF [ 7 ] , this mechanism could be the same as that reported by others at high concentrations of EGF . However , Sigismund and colleagues found that the cholesterol - interfering drug filipin can inhibit endocytosis of EGFR after stimulation with medium and high concentrations of EGF [ 14 ] . We did not observe any effect of filipin on HB - EGF - and BTC - induced endocytosis ( Figure 6 ) . Thus , the same mechanisms do not appear to be involved . We were not able to positively identify an alternative mechanism of EGFR internalization , despite inhibiting a range of known mediators of internalization ( Figure 4 + 6 – 7 , Figures S1 , S2 , S3 ) . Although macropinocytosis is a known pathway for EGFR internalization [ 11 – 13 ] we saw no effect on the uptake of EGFR after ligand - stimulation in our cells ( Figure 4 ) . Similarly we found no effect of inhibiting caveolin1 ( Figure 7 ) , RhoA , Arf6 or flotillin1 / 2 ( Figures S1 , S2 , S3 ) on EGFR internalization after stimulation with different ligands . This could indicate the involvement of an internalization pathway that has yet to be characterized . Also , long - term inhibition of endocytosis , such Figure 6 .

In this study we have utilized siRNA to inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Although this is a potent tool for inhibiting protein expression , the clathrin protein knockdown is not 100 % efficient . Thus we do observe small amount of remaining clathrin protein by western blotting ( , 5 % ) upon siRNA treatment . The remaining clathrin levels might be high enough to support the observed EGFR endocytosis if the receptor can actively recruit the remaining clathrin . This would correlate with the fact that the two ligands that can overcome the inhibiting effects of clathrin siRNA , HB - EGF and BTC , are also the two most potent activators of EGFR [ 7 ] , and the reported observation that activation of EGFR can lead to formation of new clathrin - coated pits [ 26 ] . In our earlier work we have shown that HB - EGF and BTC are potent inducers of receptor degradation [ 7 ] . To determine if the internalization observed after stimulation with HB - EGF or BTC stimulation led to degradation we measured degradation in cells after clathrin inhibition . We found that knocking down clathrin led to an almost complete inhibition of receptor degradation ( Figure 3 ) . This could indicate the presence of an alternative mechanism of internalization that does not lead to degradation . However , clathrin is also involved in endosomal sorting for degradation , and it is therefore possible that the observed inhibition in degradation of EGFR upon BTC stimulation in clathrin knockdown cells , in spite of continued internalization , could be due to impaired sorting machinery in these cells , as recruitment of the endosomal ESCRT machinery requires the presence of clathrin [ 27 ] . This study further supports the importance of clathrin in EGFR endocytosis . However , the fact that clathrin independent regula - tion of EGFR appears to be important in other cells suggests that EGFR can also utilize other pathways of endocytosis in cancer . Our results also show that internalization of the EGFR can differ Figure 7 . EGFR internalization after caveolin1 knockdown .

This cell line [ 28 ] was kindly provided by Claudia Krag ( BRIC , University of Copenhagen ) . NIH - 3T3 cells were kindly provided by Frederik Vilhardt ( Institute for Cellular and Molecular Medicine , University of Copenhagen ) . The NIH - 3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS , 2 mM glutamax and 100 units ml 2 1 penicillin , 100 mg ml 2 1 streptomycin . Cells were serum starved in starvation medium ( DMEM supplemented with 2 mM glutamax , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 100 m g / ml streptomycin ) 1 – 2 h prior to experiments . EGFR Internalization Analysis Cells were incubated with ligand ( RnD Systems , Minneapolis , Minnesota ) . Cells were washed with ice - cold PBS , washed 5 minutes with an ice - cold acidic buffer ( 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM glycine , pH 2 . 5 ) to remove any remaining bound ligand , neutralized with ice - cold PBS and trypsinized on ice until detachment . Trypsin was neutralized by addition of soy bean trypsin inhibitor , and the detached cells were fixed for 15 minutes in ice - cold 2 % paraformaldehyde . The amount of EGFR present at the cell surface was determined by labeling of the unpermea - bilized and fixed cells with an anti - EGFR antibody directly conjugated to FITC ( AbD serotec , Oxford , UK ) followed by flow cytometric analysis to quantify EGFR surface labeling . Protein Knockdown HeLa cells were transfected twice with siRNA against clathrin heavy chain ( sense sequence 1 : GCAAUGAGCUGUUUGAAGA , [ 29 ] sense sequence 2 : CCUGCGGUCUGGAGUCAAC [ 14 ] ) , or once with caveolin1 ( sense sequence : UGUCUGGGGG - CAAAUACG ) , flotillin1 ( sense sequence GCAGAGAAGUCC - CAACUAAUU [ 30 ] ) , flotillin2 ( sense sequence : GAGGUUGUG - CAGCGCAAUU [ 30 ] ) or scrambled siRNA ( mock ) ( AM4635 , Ambion , Austin , Texas / Allstars negative siRNA , Qiagen ) using Lipofectamine2000 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , California ) . Transfections with CHC siRNA were done with 48 hour intervals and experiments were performed 48 h after the second transfection . Cells were transfected once with caveolin1 , flotillin1 or flotillin2 siRNA and experiments were performed 48 hours after transfection . Protein knockdown was evaluated by western blotting using a mouse monoclonal a - CHC antibody ( Fitzgerald Anti - bodies , Concord , Massachusetts ) , a rabbit polyclonal caveolin1 antibody ( Transduction laboratories , Lexington , Kentucky ) , a mouse monoclonal Arf6 antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , California ) , a rabbit polyclonal flotillin1 antibody ( Sigma - aldrich ) a mouse monoclonal flotillin2 antibody ( Transduction laborato - ries , Lexington , Kentucky ) . A mouse monoclonal actin antibody ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and sheep polyclonal anti - EGFR antibody ( Fitzgerald Antibodies ) were used as controls . HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies were from DAKO ( Glostrup , Denmark ) . Inhibition with Amiloride HeLa cells were incubated with 1 mM amiloride 15 minutes prior to stimulation with ligand . NIH - 3T3 cells in 8 - chamber culture wells were challenged with 250 ug / ml 70 kDa lysine - fixable dextran - alexa488 , with or without 1 mM amiloride in full growth medium for one hour before washing and fixation and examined by microscopy . Inhibition with Filipin HeLa cells were incubated with 1 m g / ml filipin 1 hour prior to stimulation with ligand . To determine filipin activity the ability to inhibit uptake of 0 . 2 m g / ml alexa488 - conjugated cholera toxin ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , California ) was measured in HeLa cells by treating the cells with or without filipin for 1 hour . The cells were then incubated with choleratoxin for 30 minutes on ice with or without filipin , and then allowed to internalize cholera toxin for 1 hour at 37 u C . After the internalization the cells were washed in ice - cold PBS and then with an ice - cold acidic buffer ( 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM glycine , pH 2 . 5 ) to remove cholera toxin from the cell surface . The cells were then washed in ice - cold PBS , fixed and the cholera toxin uptake was analyzed by flow cytometry . Internalization of 125 I - EGF HeLa cells were incubated with 1 nM of 125 I - EGF ( Perkin Elmer , Waltham , Massachusetts ) and 9 nM EGF in DMEM with 0 . 2 % BSA for 15 minutes . The cells were washed three times with ice cold PBS before surface - bound 125 I - EGF was removed by incubating the cells with acetic buffer ( 0 . 2 M acetic acid , 0 . 5 M NaCl , pH 2 . 5 ) for 5 minutes on ice followed by a wash with the same buffer . The radioactivity released from the cell surface was subsequently measured in a c - counter . The cells were hydrolyzed with 1 M NaOH on ice for 30 minutes before the internalized 125 I - EGF was measured in a c - counter . Internalized 125 I - EGF was measured as the percentage of internalized to total cpm . Internalization of 125 I - transferrin HeLa cells treated with siRNA were incubated with 10 m g / ml 125 I - transferrin ( Perkin Elmer , Waltham , Massachusetts ) in DMEM with 0 . 2 % BSA for 15 minutes . The cells were washed three times with ice - cold PBS before being incubated with 3 mg / ml Pronase E in DMEM for 45 minutes on ice . The cell suspension was transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 16000 6 g for 5 minutes at 4 u C . The supernatant fraction was removed and counted in a c - counter . The pellet fraction was washed in cold PBS before analysis by c - counting . Internalized 125 I - transferrin was measured as percentage of cpm in the pellet to the total cpm . RhoA Inhibition To inhibit RhoA HeLa cells were incubated for 2 . 5 hours with 1 m g / ml C3 transferase ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO , USA ) in starvation medium . To test the C3 transferase activity actin fiber EGFR Internalization Mechanisms PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 10 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e58148 integrity was determined after treating HeLa cells with C3 transferase . EGFR Degradation Analysis Using ELISA Detection HeLa cells were incubated with ligands for 0 – 3 hours in starvation medium at 37 u C . Cells were rinsed in cold PBS and scraped off in RIPA lysis buffer ( 1 % NP40 , 20 mM MOPS , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Na - deoxycholate , 150 mM NaCl , and 1 mM ethylene - diaminetetraacetic acid ) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set II and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail Set III ( Calbiochem ) . Cell debris was removed by centrifugation . EGFR levels were then measured using an EGFR ELISA kit ( RnD Systems , Minneapolis , Minnesota ) . Microscopy HeLa cells were seeded in CC2 - coated chamber slides . The days after seeding , cells were incubated with ligands in HEPES - buffered DMEM containing 0 . 2 % BSA . Cells were rinsed in cold PBS and fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde . After fixation , cells were permeabilized and blocked in PBS containing 5 % normal goat serum ( In Vitro ) and 0 . 2 % saponin . For visualizing EGFR endocytosis immunofluorescence labeling was performed using primary antibodies ( mouse monoclonal anti - EGFR IgG2A anti - body ( clone 199 . 12 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , mouse monoclonal anti - EEA1 IgG1 antibody ( clone 14 , BD Biosciences ) ) and isotype specific secondary antibodies ( goat anti - mouse IgG1 , and goat anti - mouse IgG2A antibodies ) conjugated to alexa488 or alexa568 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , California ) . To visualize actin filaments in C3 transferase treated cells phalloidin conjugated to alexa568 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , California ) was used . To visualize macro - pinocytosis of dextran , 70 kDa lysine - fixable dextran conjugated to alexa488 was applied ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , California ) . Microscopy was done using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope , equipped with 488 and 543 nm excitation lasers , using a 63 6 1 . 4 NA oil immersion apochromat objective . Image Processing and Quantitative Analysis Images were sectioned into smaller images containing a single cell each using ImageJ with the MBF plug - in compilation . A binary mask defining the endosomes of the cells was made using Gaussian blur filtering ( sigma = 1 . 0 ) of the EEA1 channel , and then 8 - bit Otsu thresholding . The density of the EGFR signal was then integrated for the endocytic mask as well as for the entire cell . The relative amount of EGFR signal contained within the endocytic mask was calculated by dividing the signal from the mask with the total EGFR signal .
