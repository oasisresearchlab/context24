Abstract 1 Close contacts between individuals provide opportunities for the transmission of diseases , including COVID - 2 19 . Individuals take part in many different types of interactions , including those with classmates , co - workers , 3 and household members ; the conglomeration of all of these interactions produces a complex social contact 4 network interconnecting individuals across the population . Thus , while an individual might decide their 5 own risk tolerance in response to a threat of infection , the consequences of such decisions are rarely so 6 confined , propagating far beyond any one person . We asses the effect of different population - level risk - 7 tolerance regimes , population structure in the form of age and household - size distributions , and different 8 types of interactions on epidemic spread in plausible human contact networks to gain insight into how 9 contact network structure affects pathogen spread through a population . In particular , we find that changes 10 in behaviour of vulnerable individuals in isolation is insuﬀicient to reduce those individuals’ infection risk , 11 that population structure can have varied and counter - acting effects on epidemic outcomes , and that , in 12 general , interactions among co - workers have a greater contribution to disease spread than do interactions 13 among children at school . Taken together , these results promote a nuanced understanding of disease spread 14 on contact networks , with implications for public health strategies . 15 .

While not all 19 such interactions lead to a transmission event , the transmission network ( i . e . the actual set of who infects 20 whom in a population ) is a subset of this wider contact network ( i . e . the set of all interactions between 21 individuals that could result in in disease transmission ) [ 2 ] . 22 The importance of interpersonal contact for disease dynamics has been recognized for centuries , with 23 isolation of infected individuals being recorded in fifteenth century Italy [ 3 ] , and has become more formalized 24 in recent decades [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] . Yet , detailing the specific ways in which the structure of contact networks relates 25 to differences in disease spread between populations has been hampered by the size and complexity of human 26 social networks , which are an agglomeration of many different kinds of interpersonal interactions [ 7 ] . A given 27 person , for instance , will interact with some people at home ( their family or housemates ) , others when they 28 go to work ( co - workers and colleagues ) , and yet others when they go to the local store for groceries ( neighbors 29 and strangers ) . Not only do the individuals involved in each of these sub - networks differ for any given person , 30 but also the structure and intensity of interactions might likewise differ between contexts . 31 Pathogens spread differently in different localities in part because of a difference in social contact network 32 structure [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 6 ] , thus we might also expect disease dynamics to vary across social contexts : to spread 33 differently at work than at school , through a home than through a neighbourhood . Yet , unlike the case of 34 two distinct localities , these layers of interactions are also not independent from one another , linked by the 35 individuals that take part in multiple layers . It is the combination of these layers into an integrated network 36 detailing all possible infection pathways that affects the ultimate spread of disease through a population . But 37 how much does each type of interaction contribute to this final disease spread ? Can the layers be modified 38 independently in order to alter a population’s risk in the face of disease spread ? 39 Operationalizing the connection between contact network structure and disease spread , public health 40 interventions such as travel restrictions , business and school closures , and individual isolation and / or quar - 41 antining seek to reduce disease spread through direct modification of the contact network [ 11 , 12 ] . In short , 42 such modifications seek to sever potential infection pathways through the contact network before they are 43 realized , limiting the number of potential secondary cases available to a given infectious individual . These ap - 44 proaches can range from hyper - local—only isolating individuals who have been confirmed to be infected—to 45 society - wide—wholesale economic lockdowns and cordons sanitaire [ 13 ] . 46 1 .

While such efforts have , in general , been 49 found to be effective both historically [ 16 ] , and in the current pandemic [ 17 , 18 ] , they are nevertheless 50 a blunt intervention . More restrained approaches , such as test - trace - quarantine can be more surgical in 51 their application , but their eﬀicacy tends to be limited by insuﬀicient participation and high costs when 52 cases are surging [ 4 , 19 , 20 ] . A middle ground could involve restricting certain types of interactions while 53 leaving others unaffected , balancing disease mitigation and socio - economic hardship ( e . g . closing schools , but 54 leaving workplaces open , or vice versa ) . Finally , not all public health interventions seek to completely sever 55 links in the contact network . Softer approaches , such as masking , increased attention to personal hygiene , 56 improved ventilation , and physical distancing can be used to reduce the strength of interactions , i . e . reduce 57 the transmission rate given interaction between two individuals , rather than eliminating the interaction 58 altogether [ 21 , 22 ] . 59 In addition to differences between types of interactions , which might be relatively consistent from one 60 individual to another , there are also differences between individuals both in behaviour [ 23 , 24 ] and in un - 61 derlying health conditions that increase the likelihood of experiencing adverse health outcomes in the event 62 of infection [ 25 ] . While a decision might be made on a personal level ( e . g . one person might decide to return 63 to in - person work , while another might take advantage of a work - from - home option ) , the consequences of 64 this decision have the potential to propagate far beyond a focal individual , with individuals serving as either 65 bridge or firewall in a pathogen’s infection chain . 66 In this work , we investigate the impact of plausible human contact network structure [ 26 , 7 , 13 ] on the 67 spread of disease across three scales of network structure , using COVID - 19 as an example . First , we consider 68 differences in individual risk tolerance with respect to an individual’s contact with persons in the network 69 who are at greater risk of adverse outcomes following infection ( i . e . “vulnerable” individuals ) . Second , we 70 consider the effect of wider population structure on the spread of disease , comparing two locales that differ in 71 age - and household - size distributions . Finally , we add to these two considerations the relative contribution 72 of two layers in the contact network ( i . e . interactions between classmates at school and interactions between 73 co - workers at work ) . We focus on these two layers in particular as they ( along with household interactions ) 74 comprise the majority of potential transmission events in modern society [ 27 ] , and have been the focus of 75 prior research and public health interventions , better allowing us to contextualize any results [ 20 , 14 , 13 , 76 28 ] . Taken together , the results of this investigation provide a foundation for better understanding the 77 2 .

Each individual was assigned an age ( according to US 84 2019 American Community Survey data [ 30 ] ) and a binary “vulnerable” status . Vulnerability was assigned 85 according to age - adjusted hospitalization rates [ 31 ] . School - age children were then assigned to classrooms 86 ( using an approximate classroom size of 20 students ) , and pre - retirement - age adults ( accounting for US 87 unemployment rates ) to workplaces ( according to a modified distribution of US business sizes ) . To make 88 our networks more realistic , we additionally considered the effect of community spread of disease outside 89 of the structured settings of work and school ( e . g . spread at the grocery store or local shopping center ) . 90 For this , we added a layer connecting all individuals in the network to all others at a low transmission rate 91 ( i . e . “background transmission” ) . 92 Each of these four network layers is a collection of distinct , fully connected sub - networks that correspond 93 to households , classrooms , workplaces , or the community as a whole . By layering these networks together , 94 the isolated clusters from any one layer become intertwined through the connections in other layers . For 95 example , a student might be connected to an unrelated , vulnerable adult through an interaction chain 96 involving a classmate interaction with a friend , a household interaction between the friend and their parent , 97 and a workplace interaction between the parent and an elderly co - worker . The strength of interaction in 98 the co - worker and classmate interaction layers was varied systematically to explore the relative importance 99 of each of these layers , while those in the household layer ( as well as background transmission ) were held 100 constant . 101 We considered two US states as case studies for comparing differences in local population structure . Using 102 US 2019 American Community Survey data ( see Supplementary Information section S1 for detailed data 103 sources ) , we constructed synthetic networks with age - and household - size distributions matching those of 104 either Florida—a US state with a relatively high average age and small average household size—or Texas—a 105 US state with a relatively low average age and large average household size ( section S2 and fig . S1 ) . Each 106 3 . CC - BY 4 . 0 International license It is made available under a is the author / funder , who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity .

Networks were generated to have approximately the same 108 number of individuals ( 3 000 ) , which necessitates a different number of households in each network due to 109 the aforementioned differences in average household size . 110 Finally , we modified the above networks according to three risk - tolerance scenarios , generalizing be - 111 haviours to all individuals in the population . First , we considered a population in which all individuals , 112 regardless of inherent vulnerability , behave identically , fully participating in their co - worker and classmate 113 interactions . Second , we considered a case where vulnerable individuals avoid those interactions ( i . e . do not 114 go to work / school and therefore have no co - worker or classmate interactions ) in order to reduce their own 115 exposure risk . Finally , we considered a case where all members of any household containing at least one 116 vulnerable individual avoid co - worker and classmate interactions in an effort to reduce exposure to their 117 vulnerable housemates .

Transitions between classes were governed by rate parameters 125 ( table 2 ) that , when appropriate , could take two discrete values based on an individuals’ inherent vulnerability 126 to severe disease . 127 Explicitly , susceptible nodes can be infected at each timestep depending on their network connections : 128 S β j , i x −−→ E . Where β j , i x is the rate of transmission between two nodes , one infectious ( i ) and one susceptible ( j ) , 129 connected by interaction type x .

However , there was a substantial reduction 168 in these values when household members likewise avoided work / school interactions themselves from other 169 individuals in the network ( fig . 1 ) . This trend was consistent across metrics of epidemic outcome , such 170 as the peak infection prevalence , the number of vulnerable individuals infected , and the total number of 171 deaths . Likewise , we saw consistency across a range of transmission rates between classmates and between 172 co - workers , though if both rates were suﬀiciently low ( bottom left corner of each panel in fig . 1 ) , the extent 173 of disease spread was minimal . Importantly , if background transmission rates are high enough , classmate 174 and co - worker transmission is rendered irrelevant , precluding any differences between behaviour treatments 175 ( Supplementary Information fig . S5 ) . We emphasize that these effects are not simply a result of reducing 176 the number of interactions in the network . Repeating the above simulations ( i . e . removing the same number 177 of edges from each interaction layer in the network as above ) , but choosing which links within each layer 178 to remove at random ( i . e . irrespective of an individuals ( contact with ) vulnerable individuals ) , yields no 179 qualitative difference between link - removal treatments ( section S5 and fig . S8 ) . Finally , these patterns were 180 also consistent across local population structures ( i . e . Texas or Florida ) , so we aggregated results across 181 locales for figs . 1 , S2 , S5 and S8 . 182 The absence of reduced disease burden when only vulnerable individuals change their behaviour can 183 be attributed , at least in part , to the high - interaction strength expected for within - household interactions , 184 limiting the eﬀicacy of contact - reduction for vulnerable individuals sharing households with less vulnerable 185 individuals . Unless the whole household takes actions to reduce their exposure , we see limited benefits 186 of reducing a particular individuals exposure in isolation . This is true even if we only look at the rates 187 of infection in the vulnerable individuals themselves . Moreover , because the vast majority of deaths from 188 COVID - 19 are individuals with underlying health conditions that provide an inherent vulnerability to adverse 189 7 .

Each panel consists of a heatmap showing the relative epidemic outcome of simulations spanning various levels of co - worker ( vertical axis ) and classmate ( horizontal axis ) transmission . Maximum disease burden in all cases occurs when the transmission rates are both high ( top right corners of each panel ) , while the disease tends to die out with minimal cases and death when both rates are low ( bottom left of each panel ) .

This is a critical consideration 194 in the construction of policy , especially when such policies tend to be focused on individuals themselves 195 and ( occasionally ) those directly under their care , rather than a consideration of potential interactions with 196 ( and consequent transmission risk to ) other vulnerable individuals [ 43 ] . For instance , those with underlying 197 health conditions might be able to apply for remote work with a note from a medical provider , however , 198 they are less likely to be granted accommodation if their housemate is the vulnerable individual . Relatedly , 199 such policies have historically been applicable only after an individual is infected , rather than allow for the 200 reduction of transmission prophylactically . More effective protection of vulnerable individuals would require 201 facilitating household - wide action to reduce exposures [ 44 , 45 ] . 202 3 . 2 Quantifying the effect of population structure 203 Beyond individual risk - management , we found intrinsic differences in epidemic dynamics between populations 204 that differed in their age or household size distributions . Comparing a “Florida - like” population to a “Texas - 205 like” population ( just “Florida” and “Texas” , hereafter ) , we find consistent , slight differences in the peak 206 proportion of the population infectious at a given time ( “Maximum Infectious” ) and in the proportion of 207 vulnerable individuals in the network that are infected over the course of the epidemic ( fig . 2 ) . Note that 208 while vulnerable individuals make up a larger proportion of the population , on average , in Florida , we see 209 a higher proportion of vulnerable individuals getting infected in the Texas population . This is a result of 210 the higher rate of spread ( also indicated by the higher peak proportion infectious ) in the latter population , 211 due in part to the larger average household size , and consequent higher number of strong within - household 212 interactions . 213 It is noteworthy that these small differences in peak proportion of the population concurrently infectious 214 and proportion of vulnerable individuals infected were insuﬀicient to fully counter the greater intrinsic 215 mortality risk of the Florida population . This could be due , in part to the counter - acting effects of age 216 and household size distributions . In short , the household size distribution of Texas tends to lead to larger 217 outbreaks , but the larger proportion of vulnerable individuals in Florida means that a similar number of 218 individuals die despite fewer total people being infected . 219 9 .

For instance , when distributing effort to minimize lives - lost , 221 one must consider both properties of individuals in the population ( e . g . what proportion of the population 222 is at increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes ? ) and properties of the social contact network that in - 223 terconnects those individuals ( e . g . what are the most likely infection pathways by which those vulnerable 224 people can become infected ? ) . The eﬀicacy and cost eﬀiciency of any public health efforts will depend on 225 understanding these nuances and their interaction . For instance , it may be more effective to isolate young 226 family members of vulnerable individuals than vulnerable individuals themselves , since the latter tend to be 227 older and have fewer social interactions to begin with [ 27 ] . 228 Of course , the social and economic consequences of any intervention ( which may be related to the total 229 number of interactions removed under intervention ) must likewise be taken into consideration [ 46 ] . Criti - 230 cally , the effects of public policies have unequal effects across a population : school closure most negatively 231 affects less - educated families [ 47 ] , wealthier individuals are more able to tolerate ( and comply with ) travel 232 restrictions [ 48 , 46 ] , and already marginalized communities often bear the brunt of adverse medical out - 233 comes [ 49 ] . Likewise , the distribution of underlying medical conditions is not distributed uniformly across 234 the population , often correlating with race and socio - economic status [ 50 , 51 ] . Thus , an intervention focused 235 on ( families of ) vulnerable individuals , will necessarily also have disparate social and financial impact on 236 these already marginalized individuals . In short , while this study focuses on generic effects of contact net - 237 work structure on disease spread , real - world applications must additionally consider the specifics of which 238 individuals are affected by a policy decision . 239 3 . 3 Quantifying effects of interaction types 240 While it is diﬀicult to disentangle the web of interactions that make up modern societies , we used linear 241 models to investigate the effects of a given change in interaction strength in one layer on the rate or extent 242 of disease spread in the population . 243 We found that a change in the co - worker transmission rate consistently resulted in a larger change in 244 epidemic outcome than a similarly sized change in the classmate transmission rate ( fig . 3 ) . For example , an 245 increase in co - worker transmission rate will have approximately twice the effect on peak proportion infectious , 246 total death burden , and time to that peak than will a similar increase in classmate transmission . When 247 considering the scenario of no change in behaviour based on vulnerability , this ratio climbs to approximately 248 3 . Consistent with results in fig . 1 , we saw smaller slopes ( and reduced differences between the effects of 249 11 .

Consistent with fig . 2 , we saw that changes in transmission rates tended to have a larger effect 251 ( i . e . model coeﬀicient magnitude ) on epidemic size in Texas , and on mortality in Florida ( driven mostly by 252 workplace interactions ) . 253 This is driven in part by the difference in the number of interactions in the network associated with each 254 layer of the network . Because there are more individuals of working age than of school age , and because 255 workplaces can potentially be much larger than classrooms , there tends to be more co - worker interactions 256 in a given network than classmate interactions . While this is dependent upon the assumptions underlying 257 construction of these simulated contact networks , it is also generically true of the real human contact net - 258 works that inspired our approach . In most real - world societies , there are more working - age individuals than 259 children , and workplaces can potentially be orders of magnitude larger than school classrooms . The fact 260 that these results seem to be robust to imbalance in interaction strength suggests that network structure 261 ( broadly construed ) may have a larger role to play than pairwise interaction strength , at least for a highly 262 transmissible disease like COVID - 19 . 263 While the surface - level implication of these results is that efforts should be focused on workplaces , rather 264 than classrooms ( and this is reinforced by evidence that , at least for early strains of SARS - CoV - 2 , trans - 265 mission to , from , and among children may be less than that among adults ; [ 35 , 52 , 53 , 54 ] ) , schools still 266 contribute meaningfully to disease spread , especially when considering some of the more recent ( and more 267 transmissible ) strains of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 55 ] . Importantly , these results are based on simulations where the 268 internal networks for workplaces are very highly connected . Compartmentalizing workers , improving per - 269 sonal hygiene , ensuring adequate ventilation and air filtration , and supporting personal protective equipment 270 usage can all alter the number and strength of interactions within the network . Such interventions would 271 reduce the overall impact of workplace interactions on disease spread . 272 12 .

The vertical axis indicates the value of the best - fitting coeﬀicient for each transmission rate in a linear model of the form y ∼ m 1 log ( β classmate ) + m 2 log ( β co − worker ) + b , where y indicates an epidemic outcome measure , m n is a fitted slope coeﬀicient , β x represents a transmission rate for interaction type x , and b is a fitted intercept coeﬀicient . The horizontal axis distinguishes between the two coeﬀicients ( m 1 : “classmate” , or m 2 : “co - worker” ) . Facets distinguish between epidemic outcome measures , point shapes distinguish risk - tolerance regimes ( i . e . rows in fig . 1 ) , and point colours distinguish age and household size distribution locales ( as in fig . 2 ) . Vertical lines extending beyond the point extents indicate 95 % confidence intervals for the slope estimates ( most confidence intervals are obscured by the points ) . To ease interpretation , lines connect coeﬀicient values across interaction types for results from models of the same risk - tolerance regime and locale . Points are slightly offset horizontally to reduce overlap . Note that a more positive slope in the left and center facets indicates a greater number of individuals infectious or died , respectively , while a more negative slope in the right facet indicates a faster rate of infection ( less time to reach peak infectiousness ) . Only outcomes from epidemics resulting in greater than 5 % of the total population being infected were included in the linear models ( 13 182 simulations for Florida , 14 844 for Texas ) . n . b . each panel has independent vertical axes limits .

Future studies could , 275 for example , consider differences in fine - scale network structure between interaction types , add additional 276 explicit interaction layers , and increase network size to better reflect a whole urban area . In particular , 277 one might nest individual classrooms within a less - strongly connected collection to represent a school , where 278 interactions can likewise occur in public spaces such as the cafeteria or library [ 26 , 56 ] . Such interactions 279 are increasingly likely as schools relax their physical distancing requirements . Similarly , there might be 280 differences in between - and within - classroom structure for differently aged students . Within workplaces , 281 there might be a hierarchical network structure , where some peoples ( e . g . managers ) might interact with a 282 collection of individuals that otherwise have little interaction with one another . Finally , we focused on only 283 two types of interactions : those between classmates and those between co - workers . Clearly , there are myriad 284 other ways in which individuals interact with one another , each of which might be structured in unique ways . 285 This study was in part limited by available data sources . While national - level data is readily available 286 for most elements of our network generation , the same data for localities ( even at the level of US states ) is 287 less accessible . An additional consideration is covariance between different aspects of population structure , 288 where most data sources are segmented . For instance , one might assume that larger households have a lower 289 average age ( i . e . more children ) , yet age and household - size distributions are only available independently 290 through the US Census American Community Survey . 291 In our disease model , we utilized disease parameters corresponding to the initial wave of COVID - 19 , 292 despite substantial strain evolution since that time . Because our focus in this work is not on any one disease 293 in particular , we opted to use an older strain for the increased availability and reliability of parameter 294 estimates . These literature - based parameters additionally result in mortality being almost exclusively among 295 vulnerable individuals—a trait we treated as binary and assigned based on post hoc empirical hospitalization 296 rates . A more robust approach would be to consider the distribution of specific underlying health conditions 297 within the population and their relative contribution to adverse outcomes . Critically , this approach also 298 assumes constant mortality rates , disregarding a known relationship in which increased hospital occupancy 299 results in worse disease outcomes [ 57 ] . 300 14 .

Nevertheless , the results presented here stem 303 from a disease model that could be applied to many transmissible diseases with minimal modification . Even in 304 the consideration of SARS - CoV - 2 , as new strains arise , resulting in altered rates of transmission , progression , 305 recovery , and / or mortality , we expect the fundamental effects of network structure on disease spread to 306 persist . For instance , as COVID - 19 mortality rates have sequentially declined over the past two years , 307 focus has shifted from mortality to hospitalization . As the drivers behind hospitalization and mortality are 308 largely equivalent [ 58 , 59 ] , one could apply this same framework in the context of hospitalization . Likewise , 309 vaccination ( depending on eﬀicacy ) can be thought of as equivalent to either removing interactions ( as in 310 isolation ) or reducing interaction strength ( as in increased mask usage ) . Thus , omitting consideration of the 311 additional benefits of reduced disease severity on the vaccinated individual , vaccination strategy could mirror 312 consideration of physical distancing recommendations in this work . Importantly , when reduction of disease 313 severity is additionally considered , previous work has suggested that prioritizing vulnerable individuals is 314 most eﬀicacious [ 60 ] . 315 6 Conclusion 316 Our simulations reinforce the consequences of our highly connected , modern society on disease spread . In 317 short , we find that decisions are rarely “personal” when it comes to public health , and the policies and health 318 decisions of a population can have dramatic effects of the spread of disease . Action by vulnerable individuals 319 in isolation does little to reduce their disease burden , suggesting that policies should additionally consider 320 the potential for next - order transmission to vulnerable individuals from the less - vulnerable individuals that 321 interact with them . Additionally , a population’s composition and social contact network structure can 322 have marked effects on disease prevalence and mortality , though in our analysis these relationships were 323 slight and sometimes resulted in counter - intuitive results whereby rapid disease spread can counteract the 324 benefit of an otherwise less - vulnerable population . Finally , the structure of workplaces potentially provides 325 greater avenues for disease spread than do schools , but these effects are highly dependent on both how 326 workplaces / schools are structured , as well as the utilization and eﬀicacy of non - pharmaceutical interventions 327 in each of these contexts . 328 While over - interpretation of specific values should be avoided in purely simulation - based studies such as 329 15 .

By comparing 331 simulations across constrained axes of variation , such as types of interactions , differences in personal risk 332 tolerance ( or systemic structures and policies ) , and different population structures , we glean insights into 333 how the different layers of social contact networks can have different levels of importance when it comes 334 to containing epidemic spread . We can use this nuanced understanding to better inform and differentiate 335 between public health strategies . 336 7 Acknowledgements 337 We thank Janine Mistrick , Chris Wojan , Emily Schafsteck , Desiree Walton , and Lisa Meyer for feedback on 338 early drafts of this work . 339 8 Funding 340 This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [ DEB 1654609 and 2030509 ] , a University of 341 Minnesota Oﬀice of Academic Clinical Affairs COVID - 19 Rapid Response Grant , the Oﬀice of the Director , 342 National Institutes of Health [ NIH T32OD010993 ] , the University of Minnesota Informatics Institute Mn - 343 DRIVE program , the Van Sloun Foundation , and by the National Socio - Environmental Synthesis Center 344 ( SESYNC ) under funding received from the National Science Foundation [ DBI 1639145 ] .

Individual vulnerability was assigned based on age - 532 specific COVID - 19 induced mortality rates [ S4 ] . To construct the underlying age distribution , we used 533 United States American Community Survey data from 2019 , specifically publications DP05 : Demographic 534 and Housing Estimates [ S5 ] . Each individual in the network was probabilistically assigned into one of thirteen 535 ( less than 5 years old , 5 - 9 , 10 - 14 , 15 - 19 , 20 - 24 , 25 - 34 , 35 - 44 , 45 - 54 , 55 - 59 , 60 - 64 , 65 - 74 , 75 - 84 , or greater 536 than 84 years old ) age classes based on state - specific age distributions . The distribution of ages across the 537 network was modified from an initial random allocation to prevent the occurrence of households in which all 538 23 .

Within 541 each classroom , networks were fully connected : all students had the same interaction strength with all other 542 students in the classroom . 543 The workplace layer similarly considered all working - age adults ( 20 - 24 , 25 - 34 , 35 - 44 , 45 - 54 , 55 - 59 , or 544 60 - 64 years old ) , subtracted a percentage ( 10 % ) based on unemployment rates in the spring - summer of 2020 545 [ S7 ] , and assigned the remainder to workplaces whose size was loosely based on the distribution of workplace 546 sizes in the United States [ S8 ] . This latter distribution was modified to remove especially small ( less than 5 547 workers ) and large ( greater than 100 workers ) work places . Within workplaces , as with classrooms , networks 548 are fully connected : all workers have an equal level of contact with all other workers at the same workplace . 549 S2 Locality network structure comparison 550 * * * * Household Size 1 2 3 4 5 6 > 6 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 P r opo r t i on Age U n d e r 5 5 t o 9 1 0 t o 1 4 1 5 t o 1 9 2 0 t o 2 4 2 5 t o 3 4 3 5 t o 4 4 4 5 t o 5 4 5 5 t o 5 9 6 0 t o 6 4 6 5 t o 7 4 7 5 t o 8 4 8 5 a n d o v e r 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 P r opo r t i on Locale Florida Texas Figure S1 : Household size ( left ) and age ( right ) distributions for each of the two locales used in the main text . n . b . left and right plots have different vertical axis limits .

Relative epidemic outcome , quantified as the peak number of individuals infected ( left ) , the number of vulnerable individuals infected ( middle ) , or the total number of individuals that died ( right ) over the course of the simulation . Individuals in the network either : did not change behaviour in response to ( contact with individuals with ) vulnerability status ( top ) , changed behaviour if they were vulnerable themselves ( middle ) , or changed behaviour when a member of their household was vulnerable ( bottom ) . Multiple points within each hexagon were averaged to produce the plotted value . Mean values were then log - scaled and normalized for each epidemic outcome such that the maximum value is 1 ( yellow ) and the minimum value is 0 ( purple ) . Each panel consists of a heatmap showing the relative epidemic outcome of simulations spanning various levels of co - worker ( vertical axis ) and classmate ( horizontal axis ) transmission . 25 .

The vertical axis indicates the value of the best - fitting coeﬀicient for each transmission rate in a linear model fit to simulation output . Facets distinguish between epidemic outcome measures , point shapes distinguish risk - tolerance regimes ( i . e . rows in fig . 1 ) , and point colours distinguish age and household size distribution locales ( as in fig . 2 ) . Vertical lines extending beyond the point extents indicate 95 % confidence intervals for the slope estimates ( some confidence intervals are obscured by the points ) . To ease interpretation , lines connect coeﬀicient values across interaction types for results from models of the same risk - tolerance regime and locale . Points are slightly offset horizontally to reduce overlap . Only outcomes from epidemics resulting in greater than 5 % of the total population being infected were included in the linear models . 27 .
