Cell signaling events driven by these proteins are implicated in numerous processes that alter cancer cell behavior . Exploring the activities and signaling pathways of these proteins in HCC metastasis may help in identifying new candidate molecules for HCC - targeted therapy . Methods - : Hep3B ( a nonmetastatic HCC cell line ) and MHCC97H ( a highly metastatic HCC cell line ) were used in this study , and the tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins expressed in these cell lines were profiled by a phosphoproteomics technique based on LC - MS / MS . Protein - protein interaction and functional clustering analyses were performed to determine the activities of the identified proteins and the signaling pathways closely related to HCC metastasis . Results - : In both cell lines , a total of 247 phosphotyrosine ( pTyr ) proteins containing 281 pTyr sites were identified without any stimulation . The involvement of almost 30 % of these in liver or liver cancer has not been reported previously . Biological process clustering analysis indicated that pTyr proteins involved in cell motility , migration , protein autophosphorylation , cell - cell communication , and antiapoptosis functions were overexpressed during metastasis . Pathway clustering analysis revealed that signaling pathways such as those involved in EGFR signaling , cytokine - and chemokine - mediated signal transduction , and the PI3K and JAK - STAT cascades were significantly activated during HCC metastasis . Moreover , noncanonical regulation of the JNK cascade might also provide new targets for HCC metastasis . After comparing the pTyr proteins that were differentially expressed during HCC cell metastasis , we selected FER , a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase , and validated its role in terms of both expression and function . The data confirmed that FER might play a critical role in the invasion and metastasis of HCC . Conclusion - : The identification of pTyr proteins and signaling pathways associated with HCC metastasis could provide useful information for selecting new molecular intervention targets . Moreover , FER might serve as a novel drug target in future HCC therapy .

The short - term prognosis of this condition has dramatically improved due to early diagnosis and surgical resection , transplantation , and local ablation therapy . However , long - term survival is still poor due to frequent intrahepatic metastasis and distant metastasis . Therefore , determining the mechanism of HCC metastasis is a major challenge and impeding the progression of this tumor at an early stage is essential for improving the prognosis of HCC . Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is an important post - translational modification that plays a critical role in sig - nal transduction associated with cell proliferation , survival , apoptosis , mobility , adhesion , etc . Tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins ( also known as phosphotyrosine proteins , pTyr ) include a wide range of signal molecules , such as receptor tyrosine kinases , adapter proteins , and scaffold proteins , which are known to be involved in the cancer metastatic process [ 2 - 7 ] . Aberrant expression and activity of pTyr proteins in the cell signaling pathway have been reported in various human cancers [ 5 , 6 , 8 - 11 ] . In recent years , several kinase inhibitors have been intro - duced for molecular target therapy in clinical oncology . These act by interfering with the activity of specific signal - ing pathways [ 9 , 10 , 12 ] . Therefore , exploring and analyz - ing the expression profiles of pTyr proteins in HCC cells by a high - throughput method would be extremely useful for obtaining insights into the mechanisms of HCC metastasis and recurrence . Such studies would also help in identifying new drug targets for HCC therapy . In the post - genome era , proteomics techniques based on LC - MS / MS enable us to study the complete range of signal proteins present in a set of cells or tissues under specific conditions [ 13 - 15 ] . In this study , pTyr proteins were iden - tified , and a comparative study was performed between a nonmetastatic HCC cell line ( Hep3B ) and an HCC cell line with high metastatic potential ( MHCC97H ) . Several biological processes and signaling pathways were found to be strongly correlated with HCC metastasis . Among the differentially expressed pTyr proteins , FER , a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase , appears to be an important protein involved in HCC metastasis . Methods Cell culture The Hep3B cell line ( nonmetastatic human HCC cells ) was obtained from Cornell University , USA , and grown in MEM medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( PAA ) in a 5 . 0 % CO 2 incubator at 37°C . The MHCC97H cell line ( highly metastatic human HCC cells ) was established in the Liver Cancer Institute , Zhongshan Hospital , Fudan University [ 16 ] . These cells were sus - tained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( PAA ) in a 5 . 0 % CO 2 incubator at 37°C . The two cell lines have an integrated HBV DNA genome and exhibit positive alpha - fetoprotein ( AFP ) expression . These cell lines are commonly used as model cell lines in HCC studies [ 17 - 20 ] . Immunoprecipitation of pTyr proteins Cells that had grown to approximately 90 % confluency were subcultured . The subcultured cells were grown to approximately 80 % confluency and starved in serum - free medium for 12 h to reduce the phosphorylation back - ground resulting from the culture conditions . The cells were placed in a 10 - cm dish , washed twice with chilled PBS , and lysed by incubation in 1 ml modified RIPA lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 25 % sodium deoxycholate , and 1 mM EDTA supple - mented with 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 10 mM sodium fluoride , 10 mM glycerophosphate , and 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate ) for 30 min on ice . The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15 , 000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C , and the protein concentration was determined by the DC Protein Assay kit ( Bio - Rad ) . Anti - pTyr specific immuoprecipitation was performed with two different anti - pTyr antibodies . The phosphotyro - sine monoclonal antibody pTyr - 100 ( Cell Signaling Tech - nology ) and / or 4G10 ( Upstate ) was noncovalently conjugated to Protein A - agarose ( Sigma ) at a concentra - tion of 1 mg / ml beads by overnight incubation at 4°C with gentle shaking . After coupling , the antibody resin was washed twice with PBS and then three times with modified RIPA buffer ( 5 bead volumes of buffer for each wash ) . To confirm that efficient coupling had been achieved , an aliquot of the antibody resin was boiled in SDS - PAGE sample buffer for 5 min , and the yield of the released antibody was determined by running it along side a purified antibody standard on SDS - PAGE . The gels were stained with Coomassie blue . The immobilized anti - body ( 400 μ l , 400 μ g ) was added in the form of a 1 : 1 slurry in modified RIPA buffer to 50 mg cell lysate ( 1 mg / ml ) that had been precleared with 800 μ l Protein A - agar - ose at 4°C for 6 h . The mixture was incubated overnight at 4°C with gentle shaking . The immunocomplex beads were then harvested by centrifugation at 3 , 000 rpm and 4°C for 5 min and washed three times with 10 bead vol - umes of modified RIPA buffer . Finally , pTyr - containing proteins were eluted three times with 500 μ l of elution buffer ( 8 M urea , 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 , and 20 mM ethyl - amine ) for 5 min each at 96°C , and the eluates were com - bined .

Briefly , the protein sample was reduced by incubation with 5 mM rib - utylphosphine ( TBP ) at room temperature for 30 min . The protein solution was then alkylated by adding 15 mM iodoacetamide and incubating in the dark for 1 h at room temperature . The excess iodoacetamide in the reaction mixture was quenched by additional incubation with 5 mM TBP for 15 min at room temperature . Subsequently , the protein mixture was desalted on a PD - 10 desalting col - umn , as recommended by the manufacturer ( GE Health - care ) , and the buffer was exchanged with a 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 solution . Trypsin ( modified sequencing grade ; Promega , Madison , WI ) digestion was performed at a 1 : 50 trypsin - to - protein ratio ( w / w ) for 16 h at 37°C . The tryp - tic peptides were then dried in a Speed Vac . Immobilized metal affinity chromatography ( IMAC ) Phosphopeptides from trypic digestion were further enriched with the Magnetic Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit ( Clontech ) , according to the manufacturer ' s instruc - tions but with a slight modification . First , the tryptic pep - tides were reconstituted in an appropriate volume of the binding / washing buffer and incubated with the washed and equilibrated beads for 30 min at room temperature by gentle shaking . The supernatant was then removed from the beads by a magnetic separator . The beads containing the phosphopeptides were washed three times with the wash buffer . Finally , the phosphopeptides were eluted three times using a total of 100 μ l of elution buffer . The eluates were then filtered through an 0 . 22 - μ m filter and dried in a Speed Vac . Nanoflow LC - MS / MS protein identification and database searches The pTyr peptides enriched by IMAC were analyzed using an LTQ mass spectrometer ( Thermo Electron Corp . , San Jose , CA ) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source . The m / z ratios of the peptides and their fragmented ions were recorded by the mass spectrometer . The peak lists for the MS2 and MS3 spectra were generated from the raw data by Bioworks version 3 . 3 ( Thermo Electron ) using the following parameters : the mass range was 600 - 3500 , intensity threshold was 1000 , and minimum ion count was 10 . The generated peak lists were searched by the Sequent program ( included in Bioworks ) against the non - redundant human protein database of the human Inter - national Protein Index ( IPI ) ( ipi . HUMAN . 3 . 3 . fasta ) . The MS / MS spectra were searched with a precursor ion mass tolerance of 2 Da and fragment ion mass tolerance of 1 Da . Full tryptic specificity was applied , two missed cleav - ages were allowed , and static modification was set for the alkylation of Cys with iodoacetamide ( + 57 ) . To search the MS / MS data , dynamic modifications were set for oxidized Met ( + 16 ) and phosphorylated Ser , Thr , and Tyr ( + 80 ) . Neutral losses of water and ammonia from the b and y ions were considered in the correlation analysis . To iden - tify phosphopeptides on the basis of the MS / MS or MS / MS / MS spectra , the sequences must meet the following fil - ter criteria : cross - correlation value ( Xcorr ) > 1 . 5 , 2 . 0 , and 2 . 5 for singly , doubly , and triply charged ions , respec - tively ; uniqueness scores of matches ( deltaCn ) > 0 . 1 ; and peptide mass tolerance of 5 ppm . Bioinformatics analysis of pTyr proteins For functional annotation and protein - protein interaction ( PPI ) analysis , the identified pTyr proteins were submit - ted to the Human Protein Reference Database ( HPRD ) . This database contains extensive information on human proteins , including domain architecture , protein func - tions , PPIs , posttranslational modifications ( PTMs ) , enzyme - substrate relationships , subcellular localization , tissue expression , and disease association of genes [ 21 - 23 ] . This allows the identified pTyr proteins to be classi - fied into subclasses based on their biological processes and molecular functions . The expression of these proteins was also evaluated under normal and liver cancer condi - tions using the records in the HPRD . Based on the PPI information available in the HPRD , a PPI network was generated using the Cytoscape version 2 . 6 . 1 software [ 24 , 25 ] . This is an open - source bioinformatics software platform for visualizing molecular interaction networks and biological pathways . It allows these networks to be integrated with annotations , gene expression profiles , and other state data . Cytoscape contains some web plug - ins for downloading / linking a network from / to several data - bases such as pathwayCommons , IntAct , and NCBI Entrez Gene . Moreover , this software contains several plug - ins that allow computational analyses and functional enrich - ment , such as clusterMaker , BubbleRouter , and BinGO . In this study , functional clustering and signaling pathway analyses of proteins were carried out by running the BinGO , pathwayCommons , and BubbleRouter programs in Cytoscape . BinGO is a tool for determining the Gene Ontology ( GO ) categories that are statistically overrepre - sented in a set of genes or a subgraph of a biological net - work [ 26 ] . It returns the correct p - value after using two different methods to account for multiple testing . In this study , the result was evaluated by the p - value from the Hypergeometric test , and the correct p - value was calcu - lated using the Benjamini & Hochberg False Discovery Rate ( FDR ) correction . RNAi and transfection A 21 - nt long double - stranded siRNA for FER was designed on the basis of reported data . It was derived from the human FER cDNA ( accession no . J03358 ) 5 ' - AAA GAA ATT TAT GGC CCT GAG - 3 ' ( nt 84 - 104 ) [ 27 ] and was syn - thesized by Jikai Biotechnical Company ( Shanghai , China ) . The selected siRNA sequences were submitted for BMC Cancer 2009 , 9 : 366 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2407 / 9 / 366 Page 4 of 16 ( page number not for citation purposes ) a BLAST search against the human genome sequence to confirm the specificity of the siRNA . An unrelated silenc - ing sequence was selected and synthesized as a negative control . For siRNA transfection , 3 × 10 5 MHCC97H cells were seeded in a 6 - well plate 1 day prior to transfection . Trans - fection was performed with the Lipofectamine 2000 Plus transfection agent ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufac - turer ' s instructions . First , 200 pmol siRNA was diluted in 250 μ l Opti - MEM ( Gibco - Invitrogen ) and mixed with 40 μ l Plus transfection agent . This was left for 20 min at RT . Next , Lipofectamine 2000 was diluted in 250 μ l Opti - MEM and left for 5 min at RT . The two solutions were then mixed and left at RT for 20 min . After aspirating the medium , the cells were washed twice with PBS and added to 1 . 5 ml of new Opti - MEM and transfection mixture . After transfection for 4 - 6 h , the medium was exchanged with the standard cell medium . The experiments with FER RNAi were initiated 48 h after transfection . Cell invasion assay in vitro The MHCC97H cell invasion assay was performed in a 24 - well plate according to a previously described protocol but with slight modifications [ 28 ] . Briefly , 100 μ l of Matrigel ( 1 mg / ml ) was added to the upper chamber of a 24 - well transwell plate , and the plate was incubated at 37°C for at least 4 - 5 h to induce gelling . The upper cham - ber that was coated with Matrigel was washed three times using warm serum - free medium , and 200 μ l of cell sus - pension containing 1 × 10 5 cells was placed in the cham - ber . Simultaneously , the lower chamber of the transwell plate was filled with 600 μ l of the cell supernatant from 3T3 cells supplemented with 10 % FBS . After cell invasion for 30 h at 37°C , the noninvaded cells at the top of the transwell plate were scraped off with a cotton swab . All invaded cells were stained with the Giemsa staining solu - tion and counted under a microscope . The mean value of three independent experiments was used for the t - test to calculate the statistical significance . TMA construction and immunohistochemical staining A tissue microarray ( TMA ) was assembled using 100 HCC cases , consisting of 50 cases each of HCC with or without metastasis studied over a follow - up period of 2 ~ 5 years . For each case , 2 core samples of hepatoma tissue were acquired from a donor paraffin block provided by the Pathology Diagnosis Department of Zhongshan Hospital . Serial tissue sections ( 4 μ m thick ) were cut from the TMAs for immunohistochemical analysis . For immunohistochemical staining , the slides were depar - affinized in xylene and rehydrated through a graded series of ethanol concentrations . Intrinsic peroxidase was blocked by using 3 % hydrogen peroxide for 15 min . A solution of 5 % BSA in PBST ( PBS + 0 . 125 % Tween 20 ) was used to block nonspecific antibody binding , and anti - FER antibodies ( Sigma - ATLAS ) were used at the concen - tration recommended by the manufacturer . The slides were kept overnight at 4°C . After washing three times with PBST for 5 min , the slides were incubated with the secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature . Fol - lowing three additional washes in TBST , the slides were developed by DAB staining . The sections were scanned at low magnification . The immunostaining score was esti - mated on a scale of 0 to 3 based on the percentage and intensity of the stained tumor cells , using the criterion given on the ATLAS web http : / / www . proteinatlas . org . Whether the stain was distributed on the membrane or in the cytoplasm was also recorded and assessed at high magnification . The immunoreactivity was scored semi - quantitatively by counting the area and density of stained cells using the Image - Pro Plus 5 . 0 software . Manual cor - rection was then performed to normalize the score . Statis - tical analysis was performed with the SPSS13 . 0 software using the nonparametric Mann - Whitney U test . Results pTyr protein capture and the expression profiles of Hep3B and MHCC97H cells To optimize the enrichment of pTyr proteins , two differ - ent antibodies against pTyr proteins were tested for their ability to immunoprecipitate pTyr - containing proteins from the samples . The results showed that 4G10 and pTyr - 100 had different protein immunoblotting profiles ( Fig - ure 1 ) . The data illustrate the similarities and differences in the pTyr proteins recognized by both antibodies . They also support the use of multiple antibodies to improve the detection of pTyr proteins . In subsequent experiments , a combination of two antibodies was chosen , which was expected to increase the types and quantities of captured pTyr proteins . Figure 1 show that the pTyr proteins in the two cell lines differed in terms of distribution and quanti - ties , suggesting that different pTyr proteins may be involved in HCC metastasis depending on their metastatic potentials . Enrichment and identification of phosphopeptides After anti - pTyr immunoprecipitation , tryptic digestion , and IMAC enrichment , the eluted phosphopeptides were analyzed by LC - MS / MS using an LTQ instrument as shown in Figure 2 . As described in Materials and Methods , MS / MS spectra were used to search the human IPI 3 . 3 database with the SEQUENT ( version 3 . 5 ) software to identify the amino acid sequence and phosphorylation sites . The MS / MS spectra of CAV1 , STAT3 , CTTN , and FER are shown in Figure 3 . In total , 83 pTyr proteins contain - ing 92 pTyr sites were identified in Hep3B cells . The expression of 39 of these has not been reported previously in liver or liver cancer tissues . Similarly , 164 pTyr proteins BMC Cancer 2009 , 9 : 366 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2407 / 9 / 366 Page 5 of 16 ( page number not for citation purposes ) containing 189 pTyr sites were identified in MHCC97H cells , and the expression of 81 of these was recorded in liver or liver cancer tissues . Among the identified pTyr pro - teins , 72 pTyr proteins from Hep3B cells and 153 pTyr proteins from MHCC97H cells were differentially expressed . All of the identified pTyr proteins and sites in the two cell lines are listed in Table S1 - S3 in additional file 1 . A few phosphoserine / threonine - containing pep - tides were recovered because their original protein was tyrosine phosphorylated . Functional annotation of pTyr proteins To understand the functions of the pTyr proteins identi - fied in this study , these proteins were submitted to the HPRD database , functionally annotated based on the GO terms , and classified according to their molecular func - tions ( outlined in Tables 1 & 2 ; for detailed information , see Table S4 in the additional file 2 ) . A comparative study on the classification of pTyr proteins in these two cell lines revealed that the differential distribution in biological processes mainly involved protein , nucleic acid , and enzyme / energy metabolism . In terms of the functions at the molecular level , these proteins acted as translation reg - ulators , enzymes , kinases / proteinases , calcium - binding proteins , cytoskeletal - associated proteins , and adhesion molecules . However , there were obvious differences between the Hep3B and MHCC97H cell lines . Protein interaction analysis A computer - deduced biological PPI network map can rep - resent and indicate the interaction network that exists in a set of proteins . In this , the node molecules represent pro - teins , while the edges indicate the interactions between proteins . The PPI network can either create PPIs between proteins submitted from MS / MS identification data ( root proteins ) or it can predict new PPIs between the submit - ted protein and other proteins from previously published literature . At present , this is believed to be a promising strategy for extrapolating new functions and interactions of biomolecules . To analyze the functional implications of the protein cohorts identified in this study , pTyr pro - teins that were differentially expressed in Hep3B and MHCC97H cells were subjected to PPI analysis . The 72 proteins that were only expressed in the Hep3B cell line generated a network containing 235 nodes and 224 edges . Similarly , the 153 proteins that were only expressed in the MHCC97H cell line generated a network containing 542 nodes and 596 edges ( Figure 4A , 4B upper box ) . To view the interactions between the root proteins in each net - work , two simple networks ( the Hep3B and MHCC97H networks ) that only contained root proteins and linker proteins ( interactional proteins found in protein data - bases , and it bridges two other proteins in the PPI net - work ) were elaborated ( Figure 4 ) . In the two simple networks , linker proteins , including CEBPB , EP300 , MAPK1 , MAPK3 , MYC , PRKCB1 , RPS6KA1 , and SMARCA4 , were shared . These were involved in some important signaling pathways such as the TNF - alpha - NF - kB signaling pathway , androgen - recep - tor signaling pathway , MAPK cascade , apoptosis path - ways , Wnt - signaling pathways , cell cycle - G1 to S control , etc . These pathways play important roles in cell growth , differentiation , cell - cycle control , and apoptosis . The results suggested that the common pTyr proteins involved in these pathways may be associated with HCC pathogen - esis . Moreover , comparison of these two simple networks revealed that FER ( a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase ) was probably a protein of biological importance in HCC cell Comparison of pTyr proteins profile detected using pTyr - 100 and 4G10 antibodies in two HCC cell lines with differ - ently metastatic potential Figure 1 Comparison of pTyr proteins profile detected using pTyr - 100 and 4G10 antibodies in two HCC cell lines with differently metastatic potential . Protein extracts from two HCC cell lines were separated by SDS - PAGE ( 20 ug protein per lane ) and analyzed by Western blot with anti - pTyr antibodies , 4G10 and pTyr100 . M HCC 97 H H ep3 B M HCC 97 H H ep3 B 4G10 pTyr - 100 BMC Cancer 2009 , 9 : 366 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2407 / 9 / 366 Page 6 of 16 ( page number not for citation purposes ) metastasis . It existed as only a dual function protein ( root and linker - like protein ) in these two simple networks . It linked four root proteins - - CTNND1 , CTTN , STAT3 , and CAV1 ( see highlighted diamond node and red edge in Fig - ure 4B ) , in the MHCC97H network ; however , it was absent in the Hep3B network . Interestingly , one each of these four proteins played a key role in cytoskeletal regu - lation , cell adhesion , signal regulation , and transporta - tion . Thus , based on the results , it is reasonable to suppose that FER is an important pTyr protein and was therefore selected for sequential functional validation . Functional clustering analysis To fully predict the coherent function , all node proteins from the PPI networks of the MHCC97H and Hep3B cells were clustered according their GO attributes in biological process and signaling pathways . Biological process clustering analysis showed that in rela - tion to tumorigenesis and metastasis , identified pTyr pro - teins were abnormally overrepresented in the two PPI networks , especially in the MHCC97H cells ( Figure 5 ) . These were mainly involved in cell division , differentia - tion , development , proliferation , phosphorylation , cell communication , blood vessel morphogenesis , DNA met - abolic processes , antiapoptosis functions , intracellular protein transport , cell migration , cell adhesion , and cellu - lar localization . More importantly , biological processes related to cancer metastasis , including cell motility , migra - tion , antiapoptosis functions , cell localization , and cell communication , differed significantly between the two HCC cell lines ( p < 1 . 00E - 05 ) . On the other hand , pathway cluster analysis suggested that there was considerable overall alteration in signal transduction during HCC cell metastasis ( p = 8 . 23E - 10 to p = 4 . 20E - 25 ) . The maximum difference between the two cell lines was observed in the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway , cell surface receptor - linked signal transduction pathway , and protein kinase cascade ( Figure 6 ) . In particular , the difference was prom - inent in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) sig - naling pathway , cytokine - and chemokine - mediated signaling pathway , and JAK - STAT and phosphoinoside 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) cascades . It should be noted that the JNK cascade has a negative relationship with HCC metastasis in signaling pathway clustering ( overrepresented in the Hep3B cell line rather than in the MHCC97H cell line ) . Surprisingly , the regulatory pattern of protein amino acid phosphorylation in the two cell lines was completely reversed . In MHCC97H cells , autophosphorylation was upregulated , while in Hep3B cells , dephosphorylation was upregulated ( details of pathway clustering were out - lined in Table S5a , S5b in the additional file 3 ) . Verification of the pTyr proteins FER , CAV1 , and CTNND1 were closely connected proteins in the MHCC97H network but were absent in the Hep3B network . These proteins were selected and tested for their expression in the two cell lines by using western blot assays . As shown in Figure 7 , the total amount of these three proteins or the phosphorylated forms of these three proteins generally increased in the MHCC97H and Hep3B cell lines in response to their metastatic potential . This was consistent with the MS / MS results . These proteins were weakly expressed in Hep3B cells , and their amounts were below the detection limit of the MS assay . The functions of FER were further verified by cell invasion experiments . FER expression in MHCC97H cells was knocked - down by treatment with a specific siRNA . The results showed that the invasive ability of treated MHCC97H cells was significantly weaker than that of the control cells , and only a few cells could pass though the matrigel - coated filter ( Figure 8 ) . This indicated that FER played a role in cell invasion in vitro . TMA analysis was performed to determine the expression level of FER in HCC tissues . The TMA was constructed from a total of 100 HCC cases , consisting of 50 liver cancer tissues each from patients with and without distant lung metastasis after Scheme of enrichment and identification of pTyr proteins Figure 2 Scheme of enrichment and identification of pTyr proteins . Cells were firstly lysed in modified RIPA buffer . pTyr pro - teins and their interacting partners were then immunoprecipitated by anti - pTyr antibodies . Eluted proteins were further digested into peptides and used to IMAC for second phosphopeptides enrichment . The sample was lastly analyzed by LC - MS / MS .

TMA analysis showed that tumor tis - sue cells with distant pulmonary metastasis had higher FER expression levels than those without distant metasta - sis ( p < 0 . 001 , Figure 9 ) . This was similar to the expression pattern observed in the cell lines . Discussion Bioinformatics analysis based on computer calculations and the application of biological software is a very effec - tive and essential supplement in proteomics research . It is a powerful tool that has been extensively used for MS / MS data analysis , such as PPI studies , functional clustering , pathway mapping , and prediction of protein function and structure [ 11 , 28 - 34 ] . In this study , we examined the expression profiles of pTyr proteins in two HCC cell lines ( MHCC97H and Hep3B ) that have different metastatic potentials . For this purpose , we used an LC - MS / MS - based proteomics technique . We also compared and analyzed the interactions and functions of these proteins by PPI and functional clustering analyses based on their GO attributes that were determined by biological process clus - tering and signaling pathway analysis . The results revealed that some cell functions related to cancer metastasis were significantly upregulated in HCC metastasis , especially those involved in cell motility , migration , localization , communication , antiapoptosis processes , and protein autophosphorylation . These alterations have been partly reported in previous studies on cancer metastasis [ 35 - 38 ] . High motility and migration are prerequisites for the suc - cessful metastasis of tumor cells and their transfer to the target site , penetration into the basement membrane and blood vessels , and movement from poorly oxygenated sites to rich oxygenated sites [ 3 , 39 ] . Antiapoptosis is a piv - otal mechanism by which cancer cells are protected from elimination by means of various steps of a metastatic process [ 40 ] . At present , there are large amounts of data MS / MS spectra of the pTyr proteins , CAV1 , STAT3 , CTTN and FER Figure 3 MS / MS spectra of the pTyr proteins , CAV1 , STAT3 , CTTN and FER . BMC Cancer 2009 , 9 : 366 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2407 / 9 / 366 Page 8 of 16 ( page number not for citation purposes ) that highlight the importance of this process in cancer metastasis ( reviewed in [ 40 - 43 ] ) . Protein amino acid autophosphorylation is a specific attribute of tyrosine kinase , and its upregulation in the highly metastatic MHCC97H cells confirmed that alteration of tyrosine phosphorylation was in fact involved in HCC metastasis . Western blot analysis of the pTyr protein profile also con - firmed these results . More importantly , we found that alteration in cell communication was the most obvious cellular event in HCC metastasis . Since cell communica - tion driven by signal transduction controls all cell behav - ior and activity , aberrations in signal transduction could be a crucial factor leading to HCC metastasis and could also trigger changes in cancer cell behavior . Therefore , it is very important to explore the events that occur during the activation and regulation of the signaling pathway in HCC metastasis . For this purpose , a pathway clustering analysis was performed for the node proteins of the PPI networks in Hep3B and MHCC97H cell lines . The results revealed that EGFR signal transduction , cytokine - and chemokine - mediated signaling , and the PI3K and JAK - STAT cascades were closely related with HCC metastasis since these processes were significantly upregulated . These analytical results were similar to those obtained for liver metastasis of breast cancer [ 11 , 29 ] . EGFR is an Erb - family transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase . This receptor is shared by multiple ligands , including EGF , TGF , EGFF - like factor , and amphiregulin [ 44 ] . EGFR - mediated signaling has been implicated in a variety of human cancers and is a key regulator of the cell proliferation , migration , metas - tasis , angiogenesis , and antiapoptosis processes [ 45 , 46 ] . Recently , some studies have reported that EGFR inhibitors are effective first - line therapeutic agents in the treatment of some metastatic cancers [ 47 , 48 ] . EGFR is a potential therapeutic target in HCC treatment [ 49 , 50 ] . The JAK - STAT cascade , which is another example , is a critical sign - aling pathway that plays an important role in cell prolifer - ation , differentiation , survival , motility , and apoptosis [ 51 ] . Recently , it was reported that sustained activation of the JAK - STAT cascade was involved in hepatocarcinogene - sis and metastasis [ 52 , 53 ] . The data showed that increas - ing activity of the JAK - STAT cascade was associated with aberrant methylation silencing of the suppressor of cytokine signaling ( SOCS ) , which is a negative regulator of the JAK - STAT pathway [ 54 ] . However , another study also suggested that constitutive activation of STAT3 was closely related to HCC metastasis and was the main factor leading to the upregulation of the JAK - STAT cascade [ 55 ] . Consistent with these results , our MS / MS results also indi - cated STAT3 activation . Unexpectedly , the JNK cascade was found to be negatively associated with HCC metasta - sis , thereby deviating from its canonical functions . This indicates that the role of this cascade in HCC metastasis should be re - evaluated . Negative regulation of the JNK cascade was recently reported in prostate and ovarian can - cers [ 56 , 57 ] . Researchers showed that JNKK1 , an upstream kinase of JNK , could persistently phosphorylate JNK and activate the stress - activated protein kinase signaling path - way ( SAPK ) to induce cell apoptosis and decrease tumor metastasis . Moreover , the SAPK pathway also showed a negative correlation with HCC metastasis in this study . Therefore , these two pathways might play synergetic roles in HCC metastasis . In other words , cluster analysis of sig - naling pathways may provide some important informa - tion for predicting the functions of the pTyr proteins involved in HCC metastasis . These results have been obtained by bioinformatics studies and need to be veri - fied experimentally prior to practical application . In our study , FER , a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase , was shown to be significantly involved in the HCC metastatic process . FER was initially discovered in 1988 during stud - ies on the proto - oncogene protein Fes / Fps [ 58 ] . Since then , its involvement has been reported in growth factors / Table 1 : Functional classification of identified pTyr proteins based on biological process in Hep3B and MHCC97H cell GO - ID : biological process MHCC97H Hep3B Signaling 26 % 26 % protein metabolism 11 % 4 % nucleic acid metabolism 19 % 12 % enzyme / energy metabolism 14 % 9 % transport 7 % 7 % cell growth and maintenance 5 % 6 % novel protein 2 % 6 % others 5 % 14 % unclassified 11 % 16 % Table 2 : Functional classification of identified pTyr proteins based on molecule function in Hep3B and MHCC97H cell GO - ID : molecular function MHCC97H Hep3B transcription associated protein 11 % 10 % Translation regulatory protein 5 % 1 % Receptor 4 % 3 % Integral membrane protein 4 % 4 % DNA binding protein 1 % 2 % RNA binding protein 4 % 3 % enzyme 17 % 9 % cargo protein 4 % 4 % Cytoskeletal associated protein 2 % 5 % Calcium binding protein 1 % 4 % kinase / proteinase 14 % 11 % Ubiquitin proteasome system protein 1 % 2 % Adhesion molecule - - - 4 % adapter molecule 1 % 2 % channel protein 2 % 2 % others 7 % 6 % Unclassified 8 % 12 % unknown 9 % 16 % BMC Cancer 2009 , 9 : 366 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2407 / 9 / 366 Page 9 of 16 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Simple PPI network for pTyr proteins ( root proteins ) identified by MS / MS spectrometry with their linker proteins in Hep3B and MHCC97H cell Figure 4 Simple PPI network for pTyr proteins ( root proteins ) identified by MS / MS spectrometry with their linker pro - teins in Hep3B and MHCC97H cell .

It also plays a crit - ical role in cytoskeletal regulation , cell adhesion , migra - tion , and proliferation [ 59 - 61 ] . In this study , we examined the total and phosphorylated forms of FER ; these were found to be overexpressed in the MHCC97H cell line but not in the Hep3B cell line . Similar expression patterns were observed for CTNND1 and CAV1 , which are related to FER , and the results were also validated by west - ern blotting and MS / MS analyses . FER and CTNND1 were shown to be involved in cadherin and integrin - mediated cell adhesion . Under normal circumstances , FER could indirectly sustain CTNNB1 dephosphorylation to ensure cadherin - mediated adhesion stability . When FER is over - expressed and phosphorylated , it can directly induce CTNNB1 and CTNND1 phosphorylation , resulting in the loss of cadherin - mediated adhesion [ 61 , 62 ] . This suggests that increasing metastasis may be associated with CTNNB1 in some cancers . Moreover , CTNND1 had been implicated in the metastasis and pathogenesis of several human cancers [ 63 ] . It was shown that overexpression and phosphorylation of CTNND1 in the cytoplasm could promote cadherin - deficient tumor metastasis by regulat - ing the activity of the small GTPase [ 64 , 65 ] . CAV1 is an important marker protein of caveolae and regulates signal transduction as a scaffolding protein . Recently , CAV1 was Histogram of functional cluster analysis based on biological process for all nodes proteins from PPI networks of Hep3B and MHCC97H cell lines Figure 5 Histogram of functional cluster analysis based on biological process for all nodes proteins from PPI networks of Hep3B and MHCC97H cell lines .

CAV1 could also sustain cadherin - mediated adhesion stability . It functioned by modulating the level and / or subcellular distribution of cadherin and CTNND1 by inhibiting Src kinase activity [ 67 ] . Neverthe - less , FER was identified as a Src substrate and is involved in tumor transformation [ 59 ] . In this study , these three proteins displayed similar expression patterns in the two cell lines studied and also interacted directly in the MHHCC97H network . Therefore , we hypothesize that FER may be a key regulator in the adhesion event involv - ing these three proteins and may participate in HCC metastasis . We also examined the influence of FER on cell invasion activity in vitro . The data illustrated that the knock - down of FER by RNAi significantly reduced MHCC97H cell invasion activity , suggesting that FER could positively contribute to HCC metastasis . To verify this , we further examined FER expression in HCC tumor tissues from patients with diverse distant metastasis out - comes after tumor excision . The results showed that FER overexpression frequently occurred in tumor cells with distant pulmonary metastasis , indicating that FER is strongly associated with HCC distant pulmonary metasta - sis . Once it is confirmed that FER is a potential regulator in HCC metastasis , the next step is to understand the mech - anism by which it regulates HCC cell metastasis . To date , there are few reports on the functional regulation of FER in cancer , and the main focus has been on cell adhesion . FER was shown to play a key role in the coordinate regu - lation of E - cadherin - mediated cell - cell adhesion and integrin - mediated focal adhesion . It could move between FER , CTNND1 , CAV1 and their phosphorylated version expression in two HCC cell lines Figure 7 FER , CTNND1 , CAV1 and their phosphorylated ver - sion expression in two HCC cell lines .

Then in parallel experiment , equal protein lysates from two cell lines were immunoprecipitated using anti - pTyr 4G10 and pTyr100 antibodies , followed by reacting with FER , CTNND1 and CAV1 antibodies in Western blot assay ( upper panel ) .

In a study on FER function using the Trojan pep - tide , researchers showed that FER that had dissociated from the cadherin complex could translocate to the integrin complex where it reduced p130CAS phosphoryla - tion and interrupted integrin - mediated focal adhesion by affecting the phosphorylation of p130CAS binding part - ners , including PTP - PEST , PTP1B , FAK , and Crk [ 62 ] . FER was also reported to be an upstream tyrosine kinase for CTTN ( cortactin ) as well as Src and Fyn [ 68 , 69 ] . Phospho - rylation of CTTN by FER is very critical for its recruitment to the cadherin and integrin complex [ 70 ] . CTTN mainly participates in cytoskeletal regulation and plays a pivotal role in tumor metastasis [ 71 , 72 ] . Recently , CTTN was shown to be an essential regulator of matrix metallopro - teinase secretion and extracellular matrix degradation [ 73 ] . In another study , it was shown that phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CTTN was strongly associated with the potential to induce metastasis in nude mice [ 74 ] . Whether CTTN phosphorylation by FER also has the same effects in HCC metastasis needs to be confirmed in future studies . The results of this study suggested that FER is involved in HCC distant metastasis , and we have discussed the main mechanism and signaling pathways associated with FER functional regulation . The results from bioinformatics analysis also imply that FER is altered in MHCC97H cells in comparison with Hep3B cells . As a new functional mol - ecule , the effect of FER on HCC metastasis remains unknown . It is possible that FER can alter the metastatic potential of HCC cells by one or several of the mecha - nisms mentioned here . Further studies are required to explore the exact role of FER in HCC cell invasion and metastasis . These would be both exciting and challenging . Conclusion The tyrosine phosphorylation data presented in this study is a useful resource for studying HCC metastasis and is an effective supplement for the PTyr database reported . Many of the identified pTyr proteins , including protein kinases and proteinases , could be useful for selecting intervention targets in future studies . The presence of multiple mole - cules and signaling pathways that are overrepresented in HCC cells with high metastatic potential suggests that HCC metastasis is a complex process and that the biolog - ical strategies for HCC metastasis treatment should be cus - tomized . In this study , FER was shown to be an important protein in HCC metastasis . We hope to obtain more evi - dence for the role of FER and its mechanism of action in HCC metastasis . This molecule may be a new drug target in future HCC therapy . Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests .
