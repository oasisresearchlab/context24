SMALL * Microscopy Branch , National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , National Institutes of Health , Rocky Mountain Laboratories , Hamilton , Montana 59840 Received 15 September 1999 / Accepted 27 October 1999 Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer , a tropical ulcerative skin disease . One of the most intriguing aspects of this disease is the presence of extensive tissue damage in the absence of an acute inﬂammatory response . We recently puriﬁed and characterized a macrolide toxin , mycolactone , from M . ulcerans . Injection of this molecule into guinea pig skin reproduced cell death and lack of acute inﬂammatory response similar to that seen following the injection of viable bacteria . We also showed that mycolactone causes a cytopathic effect on mouse ﬁbroblast L929 cells that is characterized by cytoskeletal rearrangements and growth arrest within 48 h . However , these results could not account for the extensive cell death which occurs in Buruli ulcer . The results presented here demonstrate that L929 and J774 mouse macrophage cells die via apoptosis after 3 to 5 days of exposure to mycolactone . Treatment of cells with a pan - caspase inhibitor can inhibit mycolactone - induced apoptosis . We demonstrate that injection of mycolactone into guinea pig skin results in cell death via apoptosis and that the extent of apoptosis increases as the lesion progresses . These results may help to explain why tissue damage in Buruli ulcer is not accompanied by an acute inﬂammatory response . Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of a tropical skin disease called Buruli ulcer ( 18 ) , which has recently been recognized as an emerging infection in West Africa ( 12 ) . Bu - ruli ulcer patients present with indolent , necrotizing ulcerative lesions . The ulcers are characterized by extensive necrosis of the skin and underlying fat . Erythema and focal necrosis , in - cluding vascular erosion , are also present . In contrast to other pathogenic mycobacterial diseases such as tuberculosis , there is little evidence of an early acute inﬂammatory response to the infection , and the bacteria are primarily extracellular . Al - though the lesions may be quite extensive , covering up to 15 % of a patient’s skin surface , they are relatively painless . We have recently puriﬁed and characterized a polyketide toxin from M . ulcerans and termed this mycolactone ( 10 ) . When added to the mouse ﬁbroblast cell line L929 , the toxin causes 90 to 100 % of the adherent cells to undergo cytoskeletal rearrangement , subsequently rounding up and detaching from the tissue culture plate within 24 to 36 h of treatment . This has been termed the cytopathic effect ( CPE ) ( 9 , 15 , 25 ) . The toxin also causes an arrest in the G 0 / G 1 phase of the cell cycle within 48 h ( 9 , 10 ) . More importantly , mycolactone , when injected intradermally into guinea pigs , is capable of causing a lesion similar to that produced by whole organisms ( 10 ) . An isogenic mutant which does not produce the toxin is not virulent in the guinea pig model . Taken together , these data provide strong evidence that mycolactone plays a pivotal role in Buruli ulcer pathogenesis . Necrotic areas in infected guinea pig skin contain many pyknotic nuclei , a ﬁnding suggestive of apoptosis . It is impos - sible to determine by hematoxylin - eosin staining whether these cells are resident or inﬁltrated immune cells killed at the site of the lesion . In addition , the mechanism of cell death is un - known . To begin to identify the mechanism underlying the histopathology observed in the guinea pig lesions , we decided to look closer at mechanisms of cell death , such as apoptosis . The cell death apparent in mycolactone - induced guinea pig lesions is at odds with the observation that mycolactone causes growth arrest , with little reduction in viability , in L929 cells . To address the possibility that mycolactone can induce cell death in tissue culture cells with delayed kinetics , we extended the length of time of the cytopathology assay . We also included a macrophage - like cell line , J774 , in our experiments to study the possible immune regulatory functions of the toxin . J774 cells exhibit a similar cytopathology to that of L929 cells . A total of 90 to 100 % of cells exhibit cytoskeletal rearrangements within 24 to 36 h of treatment and undergo growth arrest . In addition , 24 - h pretreatment of J774 cells with toxin inhibits induction of the proinﬂammatory cytokines , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - a ) , and interleukin - 1 ( IL - 1 ) in response to lipopolysac - charide stimulation ( L . Pascopella , unpublished results ) . We have used here both in vivo and in vitro studies to determine the mechanism of cell death mediated by mycolac - tone . We demonstrate that apoptotic cells reside in the area of necrosis of the guinea pig lesions infected with either M . ul - cerans organisms or the toxin alone . This area of necrosis with apoptosis increases with time , indicating that apoptosis may play a role in Buruli ulcer pathology and , in particular , the lack of inﬂammation . We also show that the toxin does cause cell death in L929 and J774 cells , with delayed kinetics . Using the TUNEL ( terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase - mediated dUTP - biotin nick end labeling ) reaction and genomic DNA analysis , we show that the toxin can cause apoptosis to occur in the two cell lines . Treating the L929 cells with a caspase in - hibitor prevents apoptosis , but not cytopathology , suggesting that apoptosis may be a secondary , rather than primary , effect of the toxin on tissue culture cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS Eukaryotic cell culture . L929 mouse ﬁbroblast cells ( ATCC CCL1 ) and mouse macrophage cells J774A . 1 ( ATCC TIB 67 ) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and passaged in Dulbecco modiﬁed Eagle medium supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal calf serum ( Gibco BRL , Grand Island , N .

M . ulcerans 1615 ( ATCC 35840 ) cells were pas - saged as described elsewhere ( 9 ) . Mycolactone was prepared as described pre - viously ( 10 ) . Brieﬂy , late - exponential - phase M . ulcerans bacteria were harvested and extracted with chloroform - methanol ( 2 : 1 [ vol / vol ] ) fo r 2 h atroom temper - ature . The cell debris was separated from the organic phase by centrifugation , and a Folch extraction was performed by the addition of 0 . 2 volumes of water . The organic phase was dried down and resuspended in a small volume of ice - cold acetone . Mycolactone was puriﬁed from the acetone - soluble fraction on a pre - parative thin - layer chromatography plate ( Whatman Pk6F Silica Gel 60 ; Alltech , Deerﬁeld , Ill . ) developed in chloroform - methanol - water ( 90 : 10 : 1 [ vol / vol ] ) . My - colactone runs at an R f of 0 . 23 in this solvent system . Mycolactone was eluted from the silica plate in running buffer and weighed , and the effective dose was determined ( see below ) ( 9 ) . Guinea pig skin model of infection . Hartley female guinea pigs were prepared for intradermal injection by shaving the backs of the animals and anesthetizing them . M . ulcerans bacteria was used at an inoculum of 10 7 ( conﬁrmed by viable plate counting ) . Bacteria were passed ﬁve times through a 25 - gauge needle to approximate a uniform suspension . Mycolactone was air dried , resolubilized in a small amount of ethanol , and diluted in mycobacterial medium ( Middlebrook 7H9 with OADC supplement ) . As a negative control , mycobacterial medium was injected . Injections were done with ﬁnal volumes of 100 m l . All animal experi - ments were conducted according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee at Rocky Mountain Laboratories . Guinea pigs were observed daily for signs of gross pathology and were sacriﬁced at days 2 , 8 , and 22 postinjection . Lesions were excised and ﬁxed for 24 h in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde . Samples were embedded in parafﬁn , cut into 4 - m m sections , and stained with hematoxylin - eosin . TUNEL reaction on guinea pig sections . Parafﬁn - embedded guinea pig sec - tions were dewaxed with xylenes and rehydrated through an ethanol series . TUNEL reactions were performed with the In Situ Cell Death Detection POD Kit ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , Ind . ) . The sections were treated with 10 m g of proteinase K ( Sigma ) per ml ( 15 min at room temperature ) ; endogenous peroxidase was then blocked with 0 . 3 % hydrogen peroxide - phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) ( 30 min at room temperature ) and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( 2 min on ice ) . The TUNEL reaction proceeded for 60 min at 37°C with CO 2 . After a washing with PBS , the slides were incubated with the Converter - POD at a 1 : 2 dilution in a Tris - NaCl buffer ( 30 min at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 ) . For diaminobenzidene ( DAB ) detection , the slides were incubated with DAB sub - strate ( 10 min at room temperature ) . After staining with hematoxylin , the slides were dehydrated and mounted . For negative controls , the TUNEL reaction was performed on mycobacterial - medium - injected guinea pig skin sections and on M . ulcerans - and mycolactone - treated sections without terminal transferase enzyme . Cytotoxicity assay . L929 and J774 cells were plated at 2 3 10 4 in 24 - well tissue culture plates and allowed to adhere overnight at 37°C with CO 2 . The next day , mycolactone was dissolved in ethanol and diluted in tissue culture media to the appropriate concentration and added to wells . As a control , ethanol was diluted similarly in tissue culture medium and added to the wells . At the indicated times , triplicate wells of each concentration of mycolactone or control cells were har - vested by removing the supernatant , washing with PBS , and removing the ad - herent cells with trypsin followed by a PBS wash . Adherent and nonadherent cells were pooled and tested for presence of dead cells by ethidium homodimer uptake with the Live / Dead Viability / Cytoxicity Kit ( Molecular Probes , Inc . , Eu - gene , Oreg . ) . Five ﬁelds of stained cells were visualized on a Bio - Rad MRC 1000 laser confocal microscope . The percent dead and standard error of the mean values were calculated by using StatView 4 . 51 software ( Abacus Concepts ) . TUNEL reaction on L929 and J774 cells . Cells were plated and allowed to adhere overnight . The next day , 300 ng of mycolactone ( or an equivalent amount of ethanol diluted in tissue culture media for the negative control ) was added , and both adherent and nonadherent cells were harvested and pooled together at the indicated times . The TUNEL reaction was performed by using the Promega Cell Death kit ( Promega , Madison , Wis . ) . Brieﬂy , the cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde - PBS ( 20 min at 4°C ) . After a PBS wash , the cells were per - meabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 – PBS , and the TUNEL reaction proceeded at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 . The reaction was stopped by washing the cells in 2 3 SSC ( 1 3 SSC is 0 . 15 M NaCl plus 0 . 015 M sodium citrate ) . The percentage of TUNEL - positive cells was determined by counting ﬂuorescent cells in at least ﬁve ﬁelds . Fluorescence and phase pictures were taken on a Nikon Eclipse TE3000 inverted microscope with an Epi - ﬂuorescence attachment ( Nikon , Inc . , Melville , N . Y . ) . DNA fragmentation assay . In the DNA fragmentation assay , 10 6 L929 or J774 cells were plated and allowed to adhere overnight at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 . The next day , 300 ng of mycolactone ( or an equivalent amount of ethanol diluted in tissue culture medium for control cells ) per ml was added . At the indicated times , adherent and nonadherent cells were harvested , combined , washed with PBS , and lysed in 0 . 4 ml of lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 ; 4 mM EDTA ; 0 . 4 % Triton X - 100 ; 20 m g of proteinase K per ml ; for 20 min at room temperature ) . Cell debris was separated by centrifugation , and the lysate was extracted with phenol - chloroform - isoamyl alcohol ( 25 : 24 : 1 [ vol / vol ] ) twice and ethanol precipitated . The DNA pellet was resuspended in TE plus 10 m g RNase A ( 30 min at 37°C ) per ml . DNA was run on a 1 . 5 % agarose gel , stained with ethidium bromide , and photographed . Control cells were harvested at day 5 . Caspase inhibitor assay . Mycolactone or ( ethanol diluted in tissue culture medium for control cells ) was added to L929 cells at 300 ng / ml . Boc - Asp - ( Ome ) - ﬂuoromethylketone ( B - D - FMK ) ( Enzyme Systems Products , Livermore , Calif . ) , a general inhibitor of caspases , was resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) at 100 mM . At the same time as the addition of mycolactone , B - D - FMK was added at 1 m M . Control cells were treated with the same percentage of DMSO ( 0 . 001 % ) . Due to the length of the assay and the short half - life of B - D - FMK , the caspase inhibitor was re - added every day . Adherent and nonadherent cells were harvested at each time point , and the TUNEL reaction was performed as de - scribed above . Cells were observed microscopically each day and scored as CPE positive when 90 to 100 % of cells were rounded and detached . In preliminary experiments , concentrations of B - D - FMK were titrated ; 1 m M was the most FIG . 1 . Detection of apoptosis in M . ulcerans - infected guinea pig lesions and media controls .

RESULTS M . ulcerans organisms and mycolactone cause apoptosis in guinea pig skin . The extensive tissue destruction and presence of cells with pyknotic nuclei present in M . ulcerans - infected lesions suggests that apoptosis may be relevant to the patho - genesis of M . ulcerans . We performed the TUNEL assay on M . ulcerans - infected guinea pig sections 8 days postinjection and found TUNEL - positive nuclei throughout the section ( Fig . 1F ) . An area of early adipocyte destruction , edema , and some vascular disruption could be seen ( Fig . 1D to F ) . As a negative control , mycobacterial medium - treated guinea pig skin was assayed by the TUNEL reaction and very few , if any , TUNEL - positive cells were detected ( Fig . 1C ) . As a second negative control , the TUNEL reaction was also performed on M . ulcer - ans - and mycolactone - induced lesions in the absence of termi - nal transferase enzyme , and no positive nuclei were detected ( data not shown ) , indicating that the TUNEL - positive reac - tions were not due to endogenous peroxidase activity . Next , we performed TUNEL assays on tissue sections from mycolac - tone - treated guinea pig lesions at different time points post - inoculation . Controls were as shown and described in Fig . 1 . Guinea pig lesions induced by 100 m g of mycolactone at 2 , 8 , or 22 days postinoculation ( p . i . ) were analyzed ( 10 ) . Apoptotic cells were present in the necrotic areas at all timepoints ( Fig . 2 ) , and the area of apoptosis increased over time as the size of the lesion and extent of destruction grew . At all time points , the region of apoptosis was centered around the point of in - jection , indicating that the toxin was acting locally to mediate the destruction and apoptosis . At 2 days p . i . , tissue destruction was in its early stages ( Fig . 2A to C ) . Apoptotic endothelial cells were present around apparently intact blood vessels ( Fig . 2C ) . Inﬁltrated cells , possibly monocytes , were also apoptotic ( Fig . 2C ) . At 8 days p . i . , the tissue destruction was more ap - parent . Necrosis was apparent in the adipose , muscle , and underlying areas . Blood vessels show leakage into the muscle layer , presumably from microhemorrhages ( Fig . 2D to F ) . Ap - optosis was present throughout the necrotic area . The area of edema between adipocytes and muscle with primarily apopto - tic cells can be seen ( Fig . 2F ) . At 22 days p . i . , tissue destruction was massive ( Fig . 2G to I ) . Edema and calciﬁcation were ap - parent , as well as disrupted blood vessels . All nuclei surround - ing the blood vessel were apoptotic ( Fig . 2I ) . The toxin - in - duced lesions progressed much more rapidly than the bacterium - induced lesions and were more localized around the point of inoculation . There also appeared to be more TUNEL - positive cells in the mycolactone - treated lesions than in the M . ulcerans - infected lesions . These observations can be explained FIG . 2 . Detection of apoptosis in mycolactone - induced guinea pig lesions .

Mycolactone - induced cell death of L929 and J774 cells . Sev - eral characterized bacterial toxins are capable of causing cell cycle arrest followed by delayed cell death ( 6 , 31 ) , and we hypothesized that mycolactone may also cause a delayed cell death on L929 cells . We treated L929 cells with increasing concentrations of mycolactone and assayed for cell death by ethidium homodimer uptake . A wide range of concentrations of mycolactone ( 3 ng / ml to 3 m g / ml , which corresponds to approximately 4 nM to 4 m M ) caused signiﬁcant cell death of L929 cells after 3 days of treatment ( Fig . 3A ) . Concentrations at or below 300 pg / ml had no effect on cell viability . It is important to note that all concentrations of mycolactone which caused cell death also caused an identical CPE ( 90 to 100 % of cells rounding and growth arrest within 48 h ) . The lack of an acute inﬂammatory response and the paucity of peripheral mononuclear cells in M . ulcerans - and mycolac - tone - induced lesions raises several interesting hypotheses . The toxin may directly kill macrophages , or it may inhibit their chemotaxis toward the lesion . To address the former possibil - ity , we tested a mouse macrophage cell line J774 to determine whether mycolactone mediates cell death in a manner similar to ﬁbroblasts . J774 cells , like L929 cells , displayed similar mor - phological changes and dose dependence , although the kinet - ics of cell death were accelerated in comparison ( Fig . 3B ) . Like L929 cells , the J774 line was affected at concentrations above 300 pg / ml . All concentrations of mycolactone which caused cell death in J774 cells also caused identical CPE , as in the L929 cells . TUNEL assay and genomic DNA analysis . To determine whether mycolactone causes death by apoptosis , we assayed mycolactone - treated L929 and J774 cells for DNA fragmenta - tion by TUNEL and gel electrophoresis assays . At 3 days after treatment , L929 cells reacted positively in TUNEL assays ( Fig . 4B ) . J774 cells reacted positively after 2 days treatment with mycolactone ( Fig . 4D ) . Control cells were negative by the TUNEL assay . A kinetic analysis of the percentage of cells positive by this assay indicated that apoptosis occurred with slightly different kinetics in the two cell lines , occurring after 2 days of treatment in the macrophage cell line as opposed to after 3 days of treatment for the ﬁbroblasts ( Fig . 5 ) . The ability of mycolactone to induce apoptotic - like DNA fragmentation was conﬁrmed by extraction of whole genomic DNA from treated cells and electrophoresis on agarose gels . L929 cells showed the characteristic DNA laddering of apop - totic cells after 3 days of treatment ( Fig . 6 ) . J774 DNA was analyzed at day 2 and day 3 posttreatment with mycolactone , corresponding to the days with the highest percentage of TUNEL - positive cells . We were unable to detect laddering of J774 DNA with this assay , even though the experiment was repeated several times . Instead , the DNA appeared degraded compared to the control ( ethanol - treated ) cells ( Fig . 6 ) . Inhibition of apoptosis in L929 cells . The lag time between the CPE ( cytoskeletal rearrangement ) and apoptosis led us to ask whether the two events are interdependent . We hypothe - sized that , by inhibiting apoptosis , we may alter either the kinetics or the severity of the CPE . Inhibitors of the IL - 1 b - converting enzyme family of caspases have been shown to inhibit apoptosis ( 20 , 27 , 32 ) . A pan - caspase inhibitor , B - D - FMK , was used to inhibit apoptosis of mycolactone - treated L929 cells . B - D - FMK was added to L929 cells at the same time as mycolactone and re - added daily ( due to inactivation by endogenous cysteine proteases ) . Cells were analyzed microscopically for CPE as deﬁned in Materials and Methods and then harvested and processed for TUNEL reac - tion . L929 cells treated with mycolactone and B - D - FMK show normal CPE , but B - D - FMK inhibits progression to apoptosis compared to the mycolactone - treated L929 cells . B - D - FMK treatment alone caused no CPE and did not induce apoptosis ( Fig . 7 ) . We then asked whether inhibition of apoptosis by B - D - FMK would change the cell death phenotype by assaying for ethidium homodimer uptake . There was no difference in either the kinetics of cell death or the percentage of dead cells regardless of whether or not B - D - FMK was added to the my - colactone - treated cells ( data not shown ) . This ﬁnding indicates FIG . 3 . Mycolactone - mediated cell death of L929 and J774 cells . ( A ) Cytox - icity on L929 cells .

DISCUSSION Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that the M . ulcerans polyketide toxin , mycolactone , causes Buruli ulcer - like lesions in a guinea pig model of infection ( 10 , 25 ) . These lesions are characterized by extensive cell damage with many cells containing pyknotic nuclei . Mycolactone also causes a CPE on L929 cells within 48 h of treatment ( deﬁned as 90 to 100 % of cells exhibiting cytoskeleton rearrangements and growth arrest ) , with minimal loss of viability after 48 h . To resolve the apparent paradox of the two phenotypes and to begin to deﬁne the mechanism underlying the histopathology , we looked at cell death in both systems . To determine the relevance of apoptosis to pathology , we performed TUNEL assays on M . ulcerans - and mycolactone - induced guinea pig lesions and found that apoptotic cells were present in the lesions . By studying mycolactone - induced le - sions over time postinjection , it was apparent that the area of apoptosis increased over time as the size of the lesion in - creased . Not all pyknotic nuclei were TUNEL positive . One explanation for this ﬁnding is that not all cell death is apoptosis mediated . An alternative hypothesis is that apoptosis is the primary cause of cell death but that at any given time point not all cells in the lesion are TUNEL positive . Due to the dearth of guinea pig cell - speciﬁc markers , we have not deﬁnitely identi - ﬁed affected cells in the lesions . We have demonstrated here that longer exposure to the toxin causes cell death of L929 cells within 72 h across a wide range of mycolactone concentrations . J774 cells show a similar dose dependence of mycolactone and a cell death by 48 h , which is slightly earlier than for the L929 cells . Using TUNEL and DNA fragmentation assays , we showed that mycolactone induced apoptosis coincident with cell death . It is important to note that both the J774 and L929 cultures show 90 to 100 % cytopathicity but that the percentage of TUNEL - positive cells over a period of days showed a maximum of 20 to 35 % under - going apoptosis . Cytopathicity and apoptosis may be two inde - pendent primary events , with apoptosis affecting only a subset of the population . Another hypothesis is that apoptosis is a secondary result of the CPE . Inhibition of anchorage - depen - dent cell spreading has been shown to trigger apoptosis ( 8 , 24 , 30 ) , as have fungal metabolites , such as cytochalasins , which effect actin polymerization ( 28 , 30 ) . By using a pan - caspase inhibitor , we showed that mycolactone is capable of causing a CPE in L929 cells without progression to apoptosis , demon - strating that the CPE is not dependent on apoptosis . Although the mycolactone - treated L929 cells reproducibly showed a strong DNA fragmentation pattern , we were unable to demonstrate DNA fragmentation with J774 cells despite repeated attempts . There is much information in the literature describing apoptosis occurring without the presence of DNA ladder formation ( 5 , 21 , 22 , 29 ) . Perhaps the window of time that the DNA ladder would appear in J774 cells was too nar - row for us to detect and , therefore , the DNA appeared intact , as in control cells , or degraded , as in mycolactone - treated cells . Mycolactone is a complex polyketide - derived macrolide . Macrolides are broadly characterized into groups based on the number of carbons present in the lactone ring ( 4 ) . Mycolac - tone is a 12 - membered ring macrolide which is the group of macrolides containing the smallest lactone ring . Other 12 - membered ring macrolides include methymycin , litorin , patu - lolide , cladospolide , and recefeiolide ( 4 ) . Although they share a similar lactone ring size , the rest of their chemical structures bear little resemblance to mycolactone , and no biological ac - FIG . 4 .

Other macrolides that induce apoptosis in tissue culture cells include erythromycin , baﬁlomycin A1 , antimycin A , and ionomycin ( 1 – 3 , 11 , 13 , 17 ) . The concentrations of these macrolides used to induce apop - tosis are between 60 ng / ml and 6 m g / ml , which is the mycolac - tone concentration range in which we observe similar effects . These examples may or may not be relevant to mycolactone - mediated apoptosis . Whether mycolactone exerts its effects by any of these mechanisms is currently under investigation . Pathogenic mycobacteria , such as M . tuberculosis , have been shown to induce apoptosis in cultured monocytes ( 14 , 19 ) . Further analysis of the mycobacterial products which may reg - ulate apoptosis demonstrated that culture ﬁltrate of M . tuber - culosis , supernatant from heat - treated organisms , and puriﬁed protein derivative induce apoptosis ( 16 , 26 ) . Whether these extracts contain any mycolactone - like molecules is possible but as yet unknown . The most distinctive and unique feature of M . ulcerans pa - thology is the presence of cell damage in the absence of an acute inﬂammatory response . Why does this cell death not lead to an acute inﬂammatory response ? The data presented here suggest a hypothesis for how mycolactone as a single molecule might lead to this property . Recently , it has been shown that mycolactone suppressed the production of inﬂammatory cyto - kines ( 23 ) . These data could explain why neutrophils are ab - sent at early time points following infection . The results pre - sented here from both in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest FIG . 5 . Quantitation and kinetic analysis of apoptotic L929 and J774 cells . The TUNEL reaction was performed on L929 ( A ) and J774 ( B ) cells and quantitated as described in Materials and Methods . Symbols : h , control ( etha - nol - treated ) cells ; { , mycolactone - treated cells . FIG . 6 . Electrophoretic analysis of DNA from L929 and J774 cells exposed to mycolactone . Genomic DNA was extracted from cells treated with 300 ng of mycolactone per ml and electrophoresed on a 1 . 5 % agarose gel . Lane M , mo - lecular weight markers ; lane C , control L929 cells ( treated with ethanol and harvested at day 5 ) . Numbers above the lanes indicate days of treatment with mycolactone . FIG . 7 . B - D - FMK inhibits mycolactone - induced apoptosis . L929 cells were treated with ethanol only ( h ) , 1 m M B - D - FMK only ( { ) , mycolactone only ( E ) , or mycolactone plus B - D - FMK ( (cid:130) ) . Cells were harvested at each day and pro - cessed for the TUNEL reaction . 882 GEORGE ET AL . I NFECT .

Apoptosis as a phenom - enon is associated with a lack of inﬂammatory response ( 7 ) . If apoptosis is a major cause of pathology in Buruli ulcer , this could explain why an acute inﬂammatory reaction does not develop in these lesions despite extensive cell damage .
