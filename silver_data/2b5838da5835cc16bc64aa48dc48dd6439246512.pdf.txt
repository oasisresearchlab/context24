However , little is known about molecular interactions within the complex and the trajectory of tropomyosin move - ment between its ‘‘open’’ and ‘‘closed’’ positions on the actin ﬁlament . Here , we report the 8 A˚ resolution structure of the rigor ( nucleotide - free ) actin - tropo - myosin - myosin complex determined by cryo - elec - tron microscopy . The pseudoatomic model of the complex , obtained from ﬁtting crystal structures into the map , deﬁnes the large interface involving two adjacent actin monomers and one tropomyosin pseudorepeat per myosin contact . Severe forms of hereditary myopathies are linked to mutations that critically perturb this interface . Myosin binding results in a 23 A˚ shift of tropomyosin along actin . Complex domain motions occur in myosin , but not in actin . Based on our results , we propose a structural model for the tropomyosin - dependent modulation of myosin binding to actin . INTRODUCTION Muscle contraction and many other motile processes such as cell motility , endocytosis , or cytokinesis are mediated by the interaction of members of the myosin superfamily with actin ﬁla - ments . ATP binding and hydrolysis by myosin trigger a sequence of conformational changes that are associated with an approxi - mately 10 , 000 - fold change in actin afﬁnity . In turn , actin binding promotes the successive release of phosphate ( P i ) and ADP . The movement of myosin along actin ﬁlaments is thought to be caused by large conformational changes associated with the release of the hydrolysis products . Rapid rebinding of ATP leads to myosin dissociation from the ﬁlament and initiates a new cycle ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . This mechanochemical reaction cycle , ﬁrst described by Lymn and Taylor ( 1971 ) , was later extended to greater detail , including several weakly and strongly bound states of the actomyosin complex ( Sweeney and Houdusse , 2010 ) . It has only been partially characterized at the structural level . Crystal structures of myosin motor domains in the absence or presence of nucleotides or nucleotide analogs provide detailed insights into states , in which myosin is dissociated from the actin ﬁlament ( Figure 1A ) ( Coureux et al . , 2004 ; Houdusse et al . , 2000 ) . However , because the complex of ﬁla - mentous ( F ) - actin with myosin ( Figure 1A ) is refractory to crystal - lization , structural information on the actin - myosin complex was only obtained at medium resolution from X - ray ﬁber diffraction ( Huxley et al . , 1980 ; Irving et al . , 2000 ) and cryo - electron micro - scopic ( cryo - EM ) studies ( Holmes et al . , 2003 ; Rayment et al . , 1993 ; Volkmann et al . , 2003 ) . The highest resolution obtained so far for a three - dimensional ( 3D ) cryo - EM reconstruction was 14 A˚ and allowed the rigid - body ﬁtting of actin and myosin crystal structures ( Holmes et al . , 2003 ) . Along with spectroscopic studies and crystal structures of myosin II and Va motor domains in the absence of nucleotide ( Conibear et al . , 2003 ; Coureux et al . , 2003 ; Reubold et al . , 2003 ) , this reconstruction strongly suggests that myosin closes its so - called 50 kDa cleft upon binding to F - actin . This conformational change is coupled to the opening of the nucleotide - binding pocket in a manner that is not yet fully understood . In the basic functional unit of striated muscle , the sarcomere , actin , and myosin ﬁlaments are arranged in parallel and slide past each other to cause shortening . The interaction of myosin with actin is controlled by the actin - binding proteins tropomy - osin and troponin ( Ebashi et al . , 1969 ) . At low Ca 2 + concentra - tions , troponin locks tropomyosin in a position on F - actin where it obstructs the myosin - binding site , thus preventing contraction of the sarcomere ( Lehman et al . , 1995 ) . When Ca 2 + binds to troponin , tropomyosin moves azimuthally on the actin ﬁlament , in this way exposing the myosin - binding site . Myosin attaches to the actin ﬁlament and performs a power stroke , which results in shortening of the sarcomere . So far , the only structural infor - mation on the interaction of actin , myosin , troponin , and tropo - myosin is a cryo - EM reconstruction at 26 – 30 A ˚ by Milligan and Flicker ( 1987 ) . A better mechanistic description of the interac - tion of actin and myosin and its regulation by tropomyosin requires a spatial resolution , at which secondary structure elements of proteins can be identiﬁed directly , i . e . , subnano - meter resolution . Cell 150 , 327 – 338 , July 20 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 327 Here , we report the ﬁrst subnanometer - resolution structure of the actin - tropomyosin - myosin complex in the rigor ( nucleotide - free ) state determined by cryo - EM . The pseudoatomic model of the complex , obtained from ﬁtting crystal structures into the map , deﬁnes a large actin - myosin - tropomyosin interface . This interface involves two adjacent actin monomers and one tropo - myosin pseudorepeat per myosin motor domain contact . Hydro - phobic interactions that were not predicted from MD simula - tions , as well as potential salt bridges and electrostatic interactions , deﬁne a strong contact between myosin and actin . Due to this interaction , the proteins are interlocked in a cogwheel - like manner . Furthermore , we provide structural Figure 1 .

The actin - myosin interface creates a neutral groove with positively charged patches that can optimally accommodate negatively charged areas on tropomyosin . The critical importance of the tight interaction of all three proteins is further supported by the fact that several mutations in cardiac b - myosin or a - actin isoforms resulting in severe forms of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( CM ) map to the actin - myosin - tropomyosin interface . By comparing the rigor ( nucleotide - free ) and prepower stroke ( ADP / P i - bound ) state of actin , tropomy - osin , and myosin , we discovered that binding of myosin results in a shift of tropomyosin along the actin ﬁlament and conforma - tional changes in myosin , but not in actin . Notably , the closure of the 50 kDa cleft is mediated mostly by a 16 (cid:3) rotation of the upper 50 kDa ( U50 ) subdomain of myosin . Finally , we propose a struc - tural model for tropomyosin - dependent myosin binding to actin and for actin - induced nucleotide release from myosin . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure Determination and Overall Architecture Because the F - actin - tropomyosin - myoE ( ATM ) complex is most stable in the rigor state , with the nucleotide - free myosin strongly bound to tropomyosin - decorated F - actin ( Figure 1A ) , we chose to work with the complex in this state . By screening many combinations of F - actins and myosin motor domains , we searched for ﬁlaments that would work best for EM ( fully decorated , straight , stiff , and not bundled ) . The combination of rabbit skeletal muscle F - actin with the motor domain of Dictyostelium discoideum myosin - IE ( Kollmar et al . , 2002 ) ( myoE ) , a fast single - headed molecular motor that is involved in the phagocytic uptake of solid particles , bacteria , and yeast cells ( Du¨rrwang et al . , 2006 ) , proved to be the best specimen for this study . The addition of skeletal muscle tropomyosin , which wraps around the F - actin ﬁlament , improved the rigidity of the ﬁlaments even further . We observed that actin ﬁlaments were either fully decorated with myosin and tropomyosin or did not bind the proteins at all ( Figures 1C – 1E ) . This suggests that tropomyosin and myosin have a higher afﬁnity to the F - actin - myosin and F - actin - tropomyosin complex , respectively , than to F - actin alone . These ﬁndings are in good agreement with previous studies showing that the myosin motor domain subfrag - ment 1 ( S1 ) binds to F - actin - tropomyosin ﬁlaments with a 7 - fold higher afﬁnity than to undecorated F - actin ( Geeves and Halsall , 1986 ) and that myosin increases the actin afﬁnity of tropomyosin ( Eaton , 1976 ) . We collected cryo - EM images and analyzed them as described in Experimental Procedures . After separation of the data into two sets for either decorated or nondecorated ﬁla - ments ( Figures 1D and 1E ) , we determined 3D cryo - EM struc - tures of both F - actin alone and the ATM complex at a resolution of 8 . 9 and 7 . 7 A ˚ , respectively ( Figure 1F ; see Figures S1A and S1E available online ) . For the ATM complex , we determined in total three different structures from the same data set that differed mainly in the regions most distant from the helical axis ( see also Experimental Procedures and Figures S1B – S1D ) . Thepseudoatomic modelofF - actinobtainedfromapreviously published cryo - EM study by Fujii et al . ( 2010 ) and the atomic model of myoE by Kollmar et al . ( 2002 ) were then ﬁt into the elec - tron densities ( Figures 1E and S1 ) . Because no crystal structure of the full tropomyosin complex has been obtained , we used a previously published tropomyosin model that was created based on crystal structures of subfragments , low - resolution EM data , and its optimal electrostatic ﬁt to actin ( Li et al . , 2011 ) . In this way , we obtained a pseudoatomic model of the complete ATM complex that deﬁnes the molecular interactions between the partner proteins . Actin - Myosin Interface Our pseudoatomic model clearly shows that myosin interacts with two adjacent actin molecules via several loops forming a large contact surface ( 1 , 820 A˚ 2 ) . Whereas loop 2 , and helix HW , loop 4 and the CM loop of myoE form large contacts to SD1 and SD3 of the neighboring actin molecule ( actin 0 ) , loop 3 attaches to SD1 of the next lower actin along the long pitch helix . In addition , a helix - loop - helix motif of the lower 50 kDa ( L50 ) subdomain of myosin protrudes into a cavity formed by SD1 and SD3 of the upper and by the SD2 domain of the lower actin ( actin (cid:1) 2 ) , thereby interacting with both of them ( Figures 2 , 3A , and S2 ; Movie S1 ) . By examining the hydrophobic surface potentials , it becomes obvious that both the helix - loop - helix motif and the cavity are predominantly hydrophobic ( Figure 3B ) . In addition , two clusters of hydro - phobic residues on the CM loop interact with hydrophobic regions on actin ( 29 – 31 , 329 – 334 ) . As shown before , these hydrophobic stretches are important for maintaining the strong binding state of myosin ( Sasaki et al . , 1999 ) . Their critical importance for a tight binding is further supported by the fact that mutations in the genes encoding cardiac b - myosin or a - actin isoforms that result in myopathies map to hydrophobic regions of the ATM interface ( Figure 3E ; Table S1 ) . In contrast , the contacts between other regions of the actin - myosin interface are mostly mediated by electrostatic interac - tions and potentially involve the formation of salt bridges ( Figures 2B , 2C , and 3C ; Movie S2 ) . Salt bridge formation appears to contribute to the formation of a double sandwich composed of the highly negatively charged N terminus of actin ( D1 , E2 , D3 , E4 ) , a conserved positively charged region in myoE loop 2 and on helix HW ( K556 , K557 , R558 , R567 ) , a negatively charged loop from actin SD1 ( residues 20 – 28 [ D24 , D25 ] ) , and conserved positively charged residues on the myoE CM loop ( R323 , K331 , R332 ) ( Figures 3C , 3D , and S3A ) . The importance of these charged residues has been shown previously . MyoE residue R332 corresponds to human b - cardiac myosin R403 , which is associated with a severe form of familial hypertrophic CM when mutated to glutamine ( Figure 3E ; Table S1 ) ( Geisterfer - Lowrance et al . , 1990 ) . Mutation of D25 to asparagine in skeletal a - actin causes one of the most severe forms of the congenital , hereditary neuromuscular disorder nemaline rod myopathy ( Fig - ure 3E ; Table S1 ) ( Sparrow et al . , 2003 ) . The two conserved lysines at the C - terminal end of myosin loop 2 ( K652 / K653 in smooth muscle myosin II and K556 / K557 in myoE ) are necessary for triggering actin activation . The net charge and charge density of loop 2 greatly affect actin afﬁnity and for nonprocessive myosins , actin - activated ATPase activity ( Furch et al . , 1998 ; Joel et al . , 2001 ) . Cell 150 , 327 – 338 , July 20 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 329 Loop 2 sits not only in the middle of the described double sandwich but also at the center of the major actin - myosin inter - face . Our results shed light on the contribution of the actin N - terminal part to the actin - myosin interaction . It is well known that negative charges at the N - terminal part of actin are of critical importance for the ATP - dependent actin - myosin interaction ( Miller et al . , 1996 ) , especially for weakly bound actomyosin states ( Hansen et al . , 2000 ) . Remarkably , the N - terminal part is one of the few regions of actin that is not highly conserved ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . Our data also help to understand the role of the conserved TEDS site ( S334 , in our structure mutated to E334 to mimic phosphoserine ; see also Experimental Procedures ) , which is located in the CM loop . As becomes obvious from our model , the side chain of E334 is not oriented toward actin but stabilizes the CM loop through interaction with the neighboring residue K332 . This type of interaction was suggested earlier by comparing the crystal structure of the unphosphorylated myoE wild - type motor domain , where the CM loop is disor - dered , to structures of other myosins with a glutamate or aspar - tate residue at this position ( Kollmar et al . , 2002 ) . It was shown that residues D460 , E461 , and A462 on the myosin helix - loop - helix motif are important for the myosin - actin interaction ( Furch et al . , 2000 ; Giese and Spudich , 1997 ) . Although these conserved residues are at the actin - myosin inter - face in our model , there are no obvious complementary charges on the actin surface . It is therefore more likely that the negative charges in this region are important for stabilizing myosin Figure 2 .

This would also explain the observed effect of charge - modifying mutations on actin afﬁnity ( Furch et al . , 2000 ) . Earlier studies suggested an additional stabilization of the actomyosin complex by interaction of loop 3 with the SD2 of actin (cid:1) 2 ( Milligan , 1996 ; Rayment et al . , 1993 ; Schro¨der et al . , 1993 ) . Our cryo - EM structure conﬁrms that this contact exists ( Figure 1F ) . Based on our model , we can show how salt bridges may contribute to this contact ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . Biochemical experiments indicate that loop 3 - mediated contacts are not a feature shared between all myosin isoforms ( Van Dijk et al . , 1999 ) . Their presence in the complex formed by myoE and F - actin may contribute together with other factors , such as the lack of an SH3 - like N - terminal domain , to the well - ordered and straight appearance of the decorated ﬁlaments used in our study . Despite local differences , basic features of the complex described here are shared with other types of myosins . The motor domain is the most conserved region of myosin . Only minor structural differences are observed in the polypeptide backbone positions of myoE and myosin II ( Koll - mar et al . , 2002 ) . Differences are restricted to the nature of side Figure 3 .

In comparison to similar myosins , these loop regions appear to be actually more constrained than the sequences of the rest of the myosin molecule ( Goodson et al . , 1999 ) . From Prepower Stroke to Rigor State The previously observed intrastrand crosslinking of actin ﬁla - ments indicated that structural transitions in actin are necessary for actomyosin force generation ( Kim et al . , 2002 ) . To identify putative conformational changes in F - actin that result from myosin binding to the actin ﬁlament , we compared F - actin models derived from undecorated with myoE - decorated actin ﬁlaments ( Figures 4A – 4C and S4A – S4H ) . We superposed the atomic models of an undecorated ( Figure S1A ) and decorated F - actin subunit ( Figures 1F and S1D ) and determined the root - mean - square deviations ( rmsds ) between thecarbon - a positions ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . The low rmsds indicate that conformational changes are minimal and distributed over the whole structure . The strongest differences were localized in the region of the DNase I - binding loop and near the N terminus . This was also corroborated by eigenanalysis using a set of different F - actin models ( Figures 4C and S4A – S4H ) . Besides their direct inﬂuence on force generation , conformational changes in this region may Cell 150 , 327 – 338 , July 20 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 331 be responsible for the observed cooperativity of tropomyosin and myosin binding ( Figure 1 ) . Interestingly , when we comparing our F - actin model with previously published F - actin models ( Fujii et al . , 2010 ; Oda et al . , 2009 ) , we observed the highest variability in the DNase I - binding loop and the region next to the N terminus , whereas the remaining regions of actin are almost invariable ( Figures S4J – S4O ) . Therefore , we cannot rule out that the observed differences between undecorated and decorated F - actin are caused by a higher ﬂexibility of these F - actin regions , as described for F - actin ( Galkin et al . , 2010 ; Splettstoesser et al . , 2011 ) . However , based on the lack of an SH3 - like domain in myoE , which had been implicated in the cooperative binding of myosin heads to F - actin based on its role in mediating the forma - tion of contacts between adjacent myosin heads ( Schro¨der et al . , 1993 ) , we can now exclude that head - to - head contacts are important for the cooperativity of F - actin decoration by myosin motor domains . By comparing our model for myoE in the rigor state ( Figures 1A and 1F ) with the structure of myoE in the ATP state ( PDB 1LKX , chain C ) ( Figure 1A ) ( Kollmar et al . , 2002 ) , where myosin does not bind to actin , we identiﬁed conformational changes in myoE that result from its binding to the actin ﬁlament ( Figures 4D and 4E ) . The cleft that separates the L50 and U50 subdo - mains in the unbound myosin in the prepower stroke state closes upon binding to actin by a 16 (cid:3) rotation of the U50 subdo - main . As expected , the N terminal and the converter domain undergo large transitions , resulting in a swing of the lever arm by (cid:4) 70 (cid:3) ( Figures 4D and 4E ; Movies S3 and S4 ) . The same regions of variability were also found by eigenanalysis of the four available models of myoE in the nucleotide - bound state ( Kollmar et al . , 2002 ) , actin - unbound state ( PDB 1LKX , chains A – D ) , and our three models of nucleotide - free , actin - bound myoE ( Figures S1B – S1D , 4F , and S5A – S5F ) . Interestingly , the L50 subdomain shows only little movement . This indicates that this subdomain is the site for the initial weak binding of myosin to actin , whereas the U50 subdomain interacts with actin only upon closure of the 50 kDa cleft , resulting in the formation of the full actomyosin - binding site and strong binding of myosin . As perceived from our ATM model , the contact between the L50 subdomain and actin is mainly based on hydrophobic interactions , whereas the large interface between the U50 subdomain and actin is predominantly supported by electrostatic contacts . In fact , the weak binding state is , in contrast to the strong binding state , not affected by ionic strength but can be disrupted by organic solvent ( Geeves and Halsall , 1986 ) . This indicates that mainly hydrophobic and Figure 4 . Conformational Changes between Prepower Stroke and Rigor State Analysis of the variability of F - actin ( A – C ) and myoE ( D – F ) between prepower stroke ( undeco - rated ) and rigor ( decorated ) state is illustrated . ( A and B ) Atomic models of an undecorated ( Fig - ure S1A ) and decorated F - actin subunit ( Figures 1D and S1D ) , respectively , were reduced to a carbon positions only , superposed , and the rmsd was determined . Models are color coded by C a rmsd values ranging from 0 A˚ ( blue ) to 10 A˚ ( red ) . Major differences are found in the carboxy - terminal region of the DNase I - binding loop ( resi - dues 39 – 52 ) and the amino terminal region ( resi - dues 1 – 5 ) . ( C ) We performed an eigenanalysis using the published models of F - actin ( Fujii et al . , 2010 ; Oda et al . , 2009 ) ( PDB 2ZWH and 3MFP ) , ourundecoratedactinmodel ( FigureS1A ) , andour three models of actin decorated with myosin and tropomyosin ( Figures S1B – S1D ) . Depicted is the visualization of the ﬁrst eigenvector as a trajectory of SD - scaled displacements from the average structure . No clear pattern of displacements is discernable .

( D and E ) Atomic models of myosin in the prepower stroke ( PDB 1LKX , chain C ) and rigor state ( Figure 1D ) were reduced to a carbon positions only , superposed , and the rmsd was determined . Models are color coded by C a rmsd values in the range of 0 – 20 A˚ . In the converter domain , displacements ranged up to 40A˚ . The second - highest displacement locates to the U50 subdomain .

Depicted is the visualization of the ﬁrst eigenvector . Although the L50 subdomain , especially the helix - loop - helix motif , is almost invariable , clear changes are seen in all other subdomains indicating closure of the 50 kDa cleft and rotation of the converter domain .

Myosin motor domains can be crystallized in their nucleo - tide - free state , as shown for chicken myosin V ( Coureux et al . , 2003 ) and Dictyostelium myosin II ( Reubold et al . , 2003 ) . Despite the absence of F - actin , the 50 kDa cleft is closed in these structures . We compared our pseudoatomic model of myoE with the structure of the myosin V motor domain in the nucleotide - free state ( Coureux et al . , 2003 ) and found that they are quite similar . This indicates that this crystal structure indeed represents the strong binding conformation of myosin ( Figures S3B – S3E ) . In both models , the central b sheet takes on the more twisted conformation compared to the respective postrigor and prepower stroke structures ( Figures S3D and S3E ) . Whereas the U50 and L50 subdomains overlay fairly well , there are some differences in the HG , SH1 , and SH2 helices and the converter domain ( Figures S3B and S3C ) . Compared to other regions of the myosin motor , the converter domain and closely associated structural elements , such as the SH1 and SH2 helices , display increased mobility or greater variability in orientation in structurally well - accessible states of the ATPase cycle . Rigor Does Not Mean Rigid The F - actin models as well as the tropomyosin models obtained from the three ATM reconstructions ( Figures S1B – S1D ) differ only marginally ( Figures S4I and S4P – S4U ) . The myoE models , however , show major differences in the U50 subdomain and especially in the converter domain when the three ATM recon - structions ( Figures S1B – S1D ) are compared ( Figures S5G – S5L ; Movie S4 ) . This suggests that myosin displays conformational ﬂexibility even when it is tightly bound to F - actin , as previously reported by Klein et al . ( 2008 ) . Interestingly , high variability was also observed in the region of the converter domain when the four conformers of the myoE prepower - stroke crystal structure ( Kollmar et al . , 2002 ) were compared ( Figures S5M – S5R ) . This indicates that ﬂexibility of the converter domain is an intrinsic property of myoE . Remarkably , the movement of the converter domain does not result in a movement of the lever arm in the direction of the power stroke , but in a lateral movement perpen - dicular to the axis of the actin ﬁlament . If we assume a high rigidity of the myosin tail , this ﬂexibility could be important for a proper interaction of myosin with F - actin because it allows the myosin head to be azimuthally rotated with respect to the actin ﬁlament . Tropomyosin in the M State Skeletal muscle tropomyosin is an (cid:4) 40 - nm - long a - helical coiled - coil protein that winds around the actin ﬁlament . Overlaps between the N and C termini of adjacent tropomyosins occur at every seventh actin , leading to the formation of a continuous rope - like structure . Tropomyosin is divided into seven pseudo - repeating units , each of which binds to a successive actin mono - mer along F - actin . Because these units are very similar and not distinguishable at a resolution of (cid:4) 8 A ˚ , we applied the helical symmetry of actomyosin to achieve maximal resolution but at the same time accepting that the overlap region of the N and C termini will not be visible in the maps . Our electron densities show clearly two separated rod - like features that correspond to the two a helices of the tropomyosin coiled - coil winding around the actomyosin complex ( Figures 1F and S1B – S1D ) . It becomes obvious from both our structure and model that tropomyosin ﬁts nicely into the groove between actin and myosin ( Movie S2 ) . This shape complementarity , referred to as Gestalt binding , was described by Holmes and Lehman as a necessary prerequisite for the speciﬁc actin - tropomyosin inter - action ( Holmes and Lehman , 2008 ) . In addition the complex is stabilized by electrostatic interactions between myosin and tropomyosin . Myosin loop 4 acts as a central linker that can interact with both actin and tropomyosin via salt bridges ( Figures 2 and S2 ) . Myopathy - causing mutations of tropomyosin at the ATM interface either remove one of the charged residues involved in salt bridge formation or cause charge reversal , thereby perturbing the proper interaction of the proteins in the ATM complex ( Figure 3E ; Table S1C ) . In muscle thin ﬁlaments , three different positions of tropomy - osin are presumed to exist . At low Ca 2 + concentrations , troponin holds tropomyosin in the B ( blocked ) position . When Ca 2 + levels increase , troponin allows tropomyosin to azimuthally move by (cid:4) 25 (cid:3) to adopt the C ( closed ) state that allows initial myosin binding to actin . Myosin binding induces a further (cid:4) 10 (cid:3) shift to the M ( open ) position ( McKillop and Geeves , 1993 ; Vibert et al . , 1997 ) . It has long been deliberated whether tropomyosin slides or rolls over actin when changing between the different states . A rolling mechanism would imply that tropomyosin is a rather ﬂexible molecule , whereas a more rigid - body - like behavior would be required for a sliding movement . Although the observa - tion of systematic solvent exposure changes across speciﬁc stretches of the tropomyosin surface supports a rolling model ( Holthauzen et al . , 2004 ) , the low twisting stiffness of tropomy - osin and its cooperative behavior favor a sliding movement ( Li et al . , 2010 ) . Using low - resolution EM structures and computational chem - istry , Li et al . identiﬁed a position of tropomyosin on F - actin with optimal electrostatic complementarity ( Li et al . , 2011 ) . They postulated this to be its preferred position in the absence of troponin or other constraints ( Li et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 5 ) . Because this position covers the myosin - binding sites on actin SD3 and part of actin SD2 ( Figure 6A ; Movie S5 ) , it must correspond to the B rather than to the C state of tropomyosin . In order to move from this position to the M state , the position of tropomy - osin in our cryo - EM structure , tropomyosin needs to be slightly rotated and shifted by (cid:4) 23 A˚ ( Figures 5 and 6B ; Movie S5 ) . This corresponds to an azimuthal rotation of (cid:4) 31 . 5 (cid:3) and results in an overall upward shift of tropomyosin along the ﬁlament ( Fig - ure 5 ; Movie S6 ) . In comparison to the model of Li et al . ( 2011 ) , the torsion angle of tropomyosin does not signiﬁcantly change , but its radius is slightly decreased ( Figure 5 ) . The large size of the azimuthal rotation also suggests that we observe a shift from the B to the M state rather than from the C to the M state . Our results strongly suggest that tropomyosin undergoes mainly sliding instead of rolling movements on F - actin . Because troponin is missing in both the model of Li et al . ( 2011 ) and our pseudoatomic model , the position and movement of tropomyosin may not reﬂect the situation in sarco - meres , where troponin regulates the position of tropomyosin , but Cell 150 , 327 – 338 , July 20 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 333 could more closely resemble the interaction between the proteins in nonmuscle cells . Model for Myosin Binding and the Myosin Power Stroke Our pseudoatomic model provides important insights into the actin - myosin - tropomyosin interaction . Although the structural record is by no means complete for the sequence of events associated with myosin binding , the actin - catalyzed release of hydrolysis products , and the power stroke , we can use the infor - mation provided by our atomic models of myoE in the prepower stroke and rigor states to deﬁne critical steps in the process and suggest the following mechanism . Because our models show that the L50 subdomain and loop 3 are the most invariant regions between myosin in the prepower stroke and the rigor state ( Figures 4D – 4F ) , we propose that myosin initially binds mainly via this region to F - actin . In contrast to the other binding sites on actin , the ones for the L50 subdo - main and loop 3 only exist on F - actin because it is formed by the interface of two actins . Initial binding in this region might therefore also serve for myosin to discriminate between G - and F - actin . In order for myosin to bind to tropomyosin - decorated actin in the absence of troponin , myosin needs to rotate azimuthally by 20 (cid:3) away from its ﬁnal binding position ( Figure 6C ) . This mode of binding is consistent with previously described interactions of loop 2 with actin ( Furch et al . , 1998 ; Murphy and Spudich , 1999 ) and the aforementioned described ﬂexibility of the converter domain . A subsequent rotation and closure of myosin’s 50 kDa cleft , which is induced by strong interactions between actin and myosin , will push tropomyosin further aside by about 23 A˚ ( Figure 6C ; Movie S7A ) . At the same time tropomy - osin diffusion from the actomyosin complex is prevented by Gestalt binding and electrostatic interactions . In this model an oscillation of tropomyosin between M and B states , as described by McKillop and Geeves ( 1993 ) , is not necessary . However , if myosin cannot rotate in this manner , its binding to actin will be sterically hindered as long as tropomyosin remains in the B state and oscillation of tropomyosin is required ( Movie S7B ) . Whereas individual actin monomers and monomer contacts within the ﬁlament do not signiﬁcantly change their conformation during the interaction with myosin , myosin undergoes large changes ( Figure 7 ) . A rotation of U50 toward actin , and the L50 subdomain closes the 50 kDa cleft ( Figures 4D , 4E , 7A , 7C , and S6A ; Movie S3 ) . The resulting structural changes are then transmitted to actin - distal myosin domains ( Figures 7D , 7E , S6B , and S6C ) . This leads to a compression of the transducer domain , which is further ampliﬁed by the L50 subdomain ( Figures 7F and S6D ) . As a result , the N - terminal domain of myosin is compressed like a spring , which relaxes by a rotation only after P i and ADP are released , resulting in a large swing of the lever arm ( Figures 7G , 7H , S6E , and S6F ) . This is the mech - anistic basis for the ampliﬁcation of the movement induced by Figure 5 . Tropomyosin in the B and M State ( A ) Comparison of the actin - tropomyosin model when tropomyosin in its B state ( Li et al . , 2011 ) ( left ) with the ATM model when tropomyosin is in the M state ( right ) is shown . The axis of tropomyosin and the actin ﬁlament are de - picted as black bars . The angle between the tropomyosin ﬁlament and the actin ﬁlament remains unchanged upon myosin binding at (cid:4) 20 (cid:3) . Scale bar , 2 . 5 nm . ( B ) The density of actin - tropomyosin by Li et al . ( 2011 ) was calculated at 8 A˚ resolution and comparedwith the ATMcryo - EM structure . Depicted are slices through the ﬁlament at the three positions indicated by vertical markers in ( A ) . Upon myosin binding the position of tropomyosin is rotated azimuthally by (cid:4) 31 (cid:3) as indicated by the arrows . In addition to the rotation , the radial position of tropomyosin is reduced from 43 to 40 A˚ . Scale bar , 5 nm .

The power stroke can only be fully completed after Mg 2 + - ADP has been released from the nucleotide - binding pocket . A detailed descrip - tion of this process is given in Figure 7 . Obviously , more evidence is needed before our model for myosin binding and the myosin power stroke can be regarded as established . Thus , additional structures of intermediate states , such as the weakly and strongly bound ADP states , are needed . Implications for Myopathies Mutations of the genes encoding human tropomyosin , actin , and myosin isoforms are in part associated with familial hypertrophic CM or nemaline rod myopathy ( Bonne et al . , 1998 ) . Our subnan - ometer - resolution structure of the ATM complex allows a clear assignment of residues contributing to the ATM interface ( Table S1 ) . Mutations associated with severe myopathies are distributed all over the interface , where key residues are conserved across isoform and species boundaries ( Figure 3E ) . Disease - causing mutations disrupt both electrostatic and Figure 6 . Model of Myosin Binding and Displacement of Tropomyosin on Actin Filaments in the Absence of Troponin ( A ) Tropomyosin in its B state obscures a large part of the myosin - binding site on actin . ( B and C ) A shift of tropomyosin from its B to M state exposes the myosin - binding sites and allows myosin to attach to actin . This results also in an additional interface between tropomyosin and myosin . Either tropomyosin oscillates between its B and M state in the absence of troponin , or ( C ) the myosin motor domain rotatesazimuthally totheaxisofactinby about20 (cid:3) , sothattheL50subdomain ofmyosincaninteractwithmyosin - bindingsitesonactin , whicharenotoccluded by tropomyosin .

Our structure of the ATM complex could serve as a strong foundation to address the role of individual mutations in the genesis of myopathies . Moreover , the elucidation of key interactions in the ATM inter - phase will facilitate the development of drugs that target the mutated ATM complex . A drug - based approach is very attrac - tive due to the highly localized effects of the disease - causing mutations , which can be linked to the isoform - speciﬁc composi - tion displayed by ATM complexes throughout vertebrate cells and tissues .

Recombinant tropomyosin and myoE were puriﬁed from E . coli and Dictyostelium discoideum cells , respectively . Thin ﬁlaments were prepared by mixing F - actin ( 0 . 1 mg ml (cid:1) 1 ) with tropomyosin at a molar ratio of 1 : 7 in 5 mM HEPES - OH ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM glutamine , and 50 mM arginine . The full complex was prepared by additionally adding myoE at slight molar excess to the thin ﬁlaments . The resulting ﬁlament suspension was used for cryo - EM within 15 min to minimize bundling . Electron Microscopy For cryo - EM the sample was diluted 10 - fold , applied to C - Flat R2 / 1 holey carbon grids ( Protochips ) , and vitriﬁed . Filaments were imaged with a JEM - 3200FSC electron microscope ( JEOL ) at an acceleration voltage of 200kV operated at liquid nitrogen temperature . An in - column omega energy ﬁlter was used to improve image contrast by zero - loss ﬁltering with a slit - width of 12 eV . Micrographs were recorded at 169 , 644 3 magniﬁcation with an 8k 3 8kTemCam - F816CMOScamera ( TVIPS ) under minimaldose conditions ( 15 – 20 e (cid:1) / A˚ 2 ) resulting in an effective pixel size of 0 . 92 A˚ on the specimen scale . Image Processing The SPARX software ( Hohn et al . , 2007 ) was used for all image - processing steps , with the exception of the initial defocus determination , which was done using CTFFIND3 ( Mindell and Grigorieff , 2003 ) . Decorated ﬁlaments were identiﬁed using K - means clustering and processed according to the SPARX implementation of the iterative helical real - space reﬁnement scheme ( Egelman , 2000 ) . Structural heterogeneity found in myosin was separated using a codimensional PCA modiﬁed to work with structures having helical symmetry ( Behrmann et al . , 2012 ) . Fitting Atomic models of F - actin ( Fujii et al . , 2010 ) ( PDB 3MFP ) , myoE ( Kollmar et al . , 2002 ) ( PDB 1LKX ) , and tropomyosin ( Li et al . , 2011 ) were ﬁt into the EM volumes ﬁrst by rigid - body using Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) and then by ﬂexible ﬁtting with DireX ( Schro¨der et al . , 2007 ) . Eigenvector analysis of the models was done using the Bio3d package in R ( Grant et al . , 2006 ) .
