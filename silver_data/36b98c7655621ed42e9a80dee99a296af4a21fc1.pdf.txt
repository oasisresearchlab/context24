As a control , mutants that lack the Arc15 or Arc18 subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex , and the Arp2 and Arp3 temperature - cells lacking only one of the two redundant tropomyosin genes ( tpm2 (cid:1) ) were used [ 36 ] .

Third , long F - actin tails and N - WASp have been shown to associate with endocytic vesicles ment of endosomes and vacuolar oscillation in vivo . Endosome and vacuole motility requires the ability of in animal cells stimulated by strong signals such as elevated levels of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphos - Las17 to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex .

Likewise , our results suggest that endosome tails that power movement through the cytoplasm . What is the function of endosome motility ?
