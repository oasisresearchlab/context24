We identiﬁed a homozygous loss of protocadherin ( PCDH ) 17 in the course of a program to screen a panel of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) cell lines for genomic copy number aberrations . PCDH17 messen - ger RNAwas expressed in normal esophageal tissue but not in the majority of ESCC cell lines without a homozygous deletion of this gene and restored in gene - silenced ESCC cells after treatment with 5 - aza - 2 # - deoxycytidine . The DNA methylation status of the PCDH17 CpG island correlated inversely with the PCDH17 ex - pression , and a putative methylation target region showed pro - moter activity . The methylation of the PCDH17 promoter was also associated with the silencing of gene expression in primary ESCC partly . Among primary ESCC cases , the silencing of PCDH17 protein expression was associated with a poorer differentiation status of ESCC cells and possibly with prognosis in a subset of this tumour . Restoration of PCDH17 expression in ESCC cells reduced cell proliferation and migration / invasion . These results suggest that silencing of PCDH17 expression through hyperme - thylation of the promoter or other mechanisms leads to loss of its tumour - suppressive activity , which may be a factor in the carci - nogenesis of a subgroup of ESCCs . Introduction Esophageal carcinoma is the sixth most frequent cause of cancer - related death worldwide ( 1 ) , and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) accounts for (cid:2) 90 % of esophageal carcinomas diagnosed in Asian countries . Although various genetic events that contribute to the development of ESCC have been investigated in the context of muta - tions or disruptions in DNA sequence that either activate oncogenes or lead to loss of function of tumour suppressor genes ( TSGs ) , the ge - netic changes identiﬁed in ESCC cannot fully account for the patho - genesis of this disease . To identify novel TSGs , homozygously deleted regions within the cancer cell genome are probably to serve as a useful landmark ( 2 – 5 ) , although biallelic loss is a rare event and other factors , such as point mutations and epigenetic abnormalities ( 6 ) , may predominantly contribute to the functional inactivation of TSGs . Therefore , high resolution mapping of homozygous deletions in cancer cells would be of considerable help in the rapid identiﬁca - tion of TSGs regardless of the predominant cause of inactivation . Previously , we applied an in - house bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome array containing 800 bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome clones ( 7 ) to an array - based comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH ) analysis of a panel of ESCC cell lines and successfully identiﬁed ‘ low - density lipoprotein receptor - related protein 1B ’ as a potential TSG for ESCC frequently inactivated by either homozygous deletion or DNA meth - ylation from homozygous loss detected in one cell line ( 8 ) . Since the homozygous loss is usually small , more TSGs involved in esophageal carcinogenesis are expected to be identiﬁed through a higher resolu - tion search for copy number alterations ( 9 ) . In the course of a program to screen a panel of ESCC cell lines for copy number aberrations by aCGH using high - density oligonucleo - tide arrays , we have identiﬁed a homozygous loss of the protocadher - in ( PCDH ) 17 gene ( 13q21 . 2 ) , the expression of which was absent in the majority of ESCC cell lines without homozygous loss , although it was present in normal esophageal tissue . Several PCDHs , a major subfamily of the cadherin superfamily ( 10 ) , including PCDH8 , PCDH10 and PCDH20 , are frequently silenced in carcinomas of the breast , nasopharynx and lung , respectively , due to deletion , mutation or promoter methylation and inhibit cell migration or anchorage - dependent or - independent proliferation ( 11 – 14 ) , suggesting that they can function as TSGs . Since PCDH17 is in the same subgroup , the Pcdh d 2 subgroup , as PCDH8 and PCDH10 , we focused on it as a candidate for an esophageal TSG , although the biological role and clinical signiﬁcance of PCDH17 in ESCC remain unclear . Materials and methods Cell culture and primary tissue samples A total of 43 ESCC cell lines were used , of which 31 belonged to the KYSE series established from surgically resected tumours ( 15 ) and 12 were TE - series lines provided by the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research , Institute of Development , Aging and Cancer , Tohoku University , Japan . To analyse the restoration of PCDH17 , cells were treated with or without 5 l mol / l of 5 - aza - 2 # - deoxycytidine for 5 days and / or 300 nmol / l of trichostatin A for the last 12 h . Primary tumour samples and corresponding non - cancerous esophageal mucosa obtained during surgery from 13 ESCC patients undergoing tumour resection at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital ( Tokyo , Japan ) were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at (cid:3) 80 (cid:1) C until required . A total of 145 ESCC tumour samples including the 13 samples described above had been obtained from ESCC patients treated at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital between January 2000 and March 2006 and em - bedded in parafﬁn after 24 h of formalin ﬁxation . Relevant clinical and survival data were available for all patients . Written consent was always obtained in the formal style and after approval by the local ethics committee . None of the patients in either group had received chemotherapy or radiation before surgery . Disease stage was deﬁned in accordance with the tumor - lymph node - metastases classiﬁcation ( 16 ) and the Japanese Classiﬁcation of Esophageal Cancer ( 17 ) . Patients treated by non - curative resection or who died of other diseases were not includedin this study . The median follow - up period for the surviving patients was 53 ( ranging from 1 to 110 ) months . High - density oligonucleotide aCGH analysis A genome - wide analysis of copy number changes was performed using the Agilent Human Genome CGH Microarray Kit 244K ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA ) . The arrays were scanned using an Agilent scanner , and data were analysedusing the CGHAnalyticsprogram version 3 . 4 . 40 ( Agilent Technologies ) .

Mutations within the coding region of PCDH17 were analysed by means of exon ampliﬁcation and direct sequencing . Any base changes detected in samples were conﬁrmed by sequencing each product in both directions . Primers were designed for genomic sequences around each exon ( supplemen - tary Table S1 is available at Carcinogenesis Online ) . Quantitative real - time reverse transcription – PCR Levels of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) expression were measured using a quanti - tative real - time ﬂuorescence detection method ( ABI PRISM 7500 sequence detection System ; Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) with TaqMan (cid:3) Gene Expression Assays ( Applied Biosystems ) according to the manufacturer’s in - struction . Gene expressionvalues are expressed as ratios between the PCDH17 gene ( Hs00205457 _ m1 ; Applied Biosystems ) and an internal reference gene ( Hs99999903 _ m1 for beta - actin , ACTB ; Applied Biosystems ) that provides a normalization factor for the amount of RNA and subsequently normalized with the value in the controls ( relative expression level ) . Total RNA derived from normal human oesophagus was purchased from Ambion ( Austin , TX ) . Each assay was performed in duplicate for each sample . Combined bisulﬁte restriction analysis and bisulﬁte genomic sequencing Genomic DNA was treated with sodium bisulﬁte and subjected to PCR using primers designed to amplify regions of interest ( supplementary Table S2 is available at Carcinogenesis Online ) . For the combined bisulﬁte restriction analysis ( COBRA ) , products were digested with BstUI or TaqI and electro - phoresed ( 18 ) . After the gels were stained with ethidium bromide , the inten - sities of methylated alleles ( as a percentage ) were calculated by densitometry using MultiGauge 2 . 0 ( Fuji Film , Tokyo , Japan ) . A methylation density cut - off point of 20 % was considered signiﬁcant ( 8 ) . For the bisulﬁte genomic sequenc - ing ( BGS ) analysis , the PCR products were subcloned and then sequenced . Promoter reporter assay Genomic DNA fragments of interest were obtained by PCR and ligated into the vector pGL3 - Basic ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . An equal amount of each con - struct or an empty pGL3 - Basic vector was introduced into cells along with an internal control vector ( pRL - hTK , Promega ) using FuGENE6 ( Roche Diagnostics , Tokyo , Japan ) . Fireﬂy luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were measured 36 h after transfection using the Dual - Luciferase Reporter Assay System ( Promega ) , and relative luciferase activity was calculated and normalized versus Renilla luciferase activity . Western blot analysis Anti - PCDH17 rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a 15 amino acid peptide from human PCDH17 ( DHPNRDLGRESVDAE ; Operon Biotechnol - ogy , Tokyo , Japan ) and puriﬁed through an afﬁnity column . The anti - Myc - tag antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology ( Beverly , MA ) , the anti - FLAG - tag and anti - b - actin antibodies from Sigma ( St Louis , MO ) and the anti - p21 , anti - p27 and anti - CCND1 antibodies from BD Biosciences ( San Jose , CA ) , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) and Cell Signaling Technology ) , respectively . For knocking down endogenous PCDH17 expres - sion , each of the small interfering RNA ( siRNAs ) targeting PCDH17 ( Stealth RNAi TM siRNA # HSS17838383 , # HSS17838384 and # HSS17838385 ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) or a negative control ( Negative universal control Med , Invitrogen ) was transfected into cells ( 10 nmol / l ) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Cell lysate was analysed by western blotting as described elsewhere ( 19 ) . Immunohistochemistry Indirect immunohistochemistry was performed with formalin - ﬁxed parafﬁn - embedded tissue sections . Antigens were retrieved by microwave pretreatment in citrate buffer ( pH 9 . 0 ; Nichirei , Tokyo , Japan ) . After blocking in 2 % normal swine serum , the slides were incubated with an anti - PCDH17 antibody ( 1 : 3000 ) overnight and then antigen – antibody reactions were visualized with the avidin – biotin complex kit ( R . T . U . Vectastain Elite ABC Reagent ; Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and hydrogen peroxide . The slides were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin . Formalin - ﬁxed PCDH17 expression construct - and empty vector - transfected KYSE170 cells as described below were used as positive and negative controls , respectively . The speciﬁcity of the antibody was veriﬁed by western blotting and absorption testing using synthesized peptides ( supplementary Figure S1 is available at Carcinogenesis Online ) . All sections were analysed under a light microscope by two pathologists blinded to clinical characteristics and out - comes . Twenty representative ﬁelds per slidewere examined at a magniﬁcation of (cid:4) 200 . The tumour regions positive for PCDH17 were deﬁned as those containing tumour cells with cytomembrane staining of high intensity sur - rounded by stromal cells ( see supplementary Figure S1 , available at Carcino - genesis Online ) . Patients positive for PCDH17 were deﬁned as those with at least 20 positive regions in 20 images . Immunoﬂuorescence cytochemistry Plasmids expressing C - terminally Myc - tagged PCDH17 ( pCMV - 3Tag4A - PCDH17 ) and C - terminally FLAG - tagged PCDH17 linked with green ﬂuores - cent protein by an internal ribosomal entry site ( pIRES - hGFPII - PCDH17 ) were obtained by cloning the reverse transcription – PCR products of the full coding sequence of PCDH17 in - frame along with the 3XMyc - and 3XFLAG - epitope into the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV - 3Tag4A ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) and pIRES - hGFPII ( Stratagene ) , respectively . Cells transfected with each construct or the empty vector were ﬁxed in methanol , incubated with the anti - MYC or anti - FLAG - tag antibody ( 1 : 100 ) and / or the anti - PCDH17 anti - body ( 1 : 100 ) followed by incubation with a 1 : 100 dilution of Alexaﬂuor 488 or 594 conjugated anti - mouse or anti - rabbit antibody ( Invitrogen ) and counter - stained with 4 # , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole dihydrochloride ( 0 . 15 l g / ml ) . Growth assay For colony formation assays , pCMV - 3Tag4A - PCDH17 or the empty vector ( pCMV - 3Tag4A - mock ) was introduced into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . The expression of PCDH17 protein was conﬁrmed 48 h after transfection by western blotting and immunoﬂuorescence cytochemistry . For colony formation assays , cells were ﬁxed with 70 % ethanol and stained with crystal violet after 10 days of incubation in six - well plates with appropriate concentrations of G418 . Stable PCDH17 transfectants and control counterparts were obtained by introducing pIRES - hGFPII - PCDH17 or pIRES - hGFPII - empty into KYSE170 and KYSE200 cells lacking PCDH17 expression . For measurements of cell growth , 1 (cid:4) 10 4 cells were seeded in 24 - well plates . The numbers of viable cells were assessed by the water - soluble tetrazolium salt assay at 24 – 72 h after seeding . The cell cycle was evaluated by a ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorting as described elsewhere ( 20 ) . Effect of knocking down endogenous PCDH17 expression on cell growth were also assessed by water - soluble tetrazolium assay after introducing each of the siRNAs targeting PCDH17 ( Stealth RNAi TM siRNA , Invitrogen ) or a neg - ative control ( Negative universal control Med , Invitrogen ) . Scratch wound assay Stably transfected ESCC cells were cultured in six - well plates until conﬂuent . The cell layers were carefully wounded using a sterile 20 l l tip , washed twice with fresh medium and cultured for 24 h . Images of the wound monolayers were acquired on a phase contrast microscope linked to a charge coupled device camera , and the wound area was measured using CT - AS software ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) counting the number of pixels after the photographs had been converted to TIFF images . Transwell migration and invasion assays Transwell migration and invasion assays were carried out in 24 - well modiﬁed Boyden chambers ( transwell - chamber , BD Transduction , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) as described elsewhere ( 21 ) . The upper surface of 6 . 4 mm diameter ﬁlters with 8 l m pores was precoated with ( invasion assay ) or without ( migration assay ) Matrigel ( BD Transduction ) . Stable transfectants ( 2 (cid:4) 10 4 cells per well ) were transferred into the upper chamber . Following 48 h of incubation , the migrated or invasive cells on the lower surface of ﬁlters were ﬁxed and stained with the Diff - Quik stain ( Sysmex , Kobe , Japan ) , and stained cell nuclei were counted directly in triplicate . We assessed invasive potential by calculating an invasion index , which is the ratio of the percentage invasion through the Matrigel - coated ﬁlters relative to the migration through the uncoated ﬁlters of test cells over that in the control counterparts . Statistical analysis Differences between subgroups were tested with the Student’s t - test . Correla - tions between PCDH17 expression in primary tumours and the clinicopatho - logic variables pertaining to the corresponding patients were analysed for statistical signiﬁcance with the v 2 or Fisher’s exact tests . For the analysis of survival , Kaplan – Meier survival curves were constructed for groups based on univariate predictors and differences between the groups were tested with the log - rank test . Differences were assessed with a two - sided test and considered signiﬁcant at a P , 0 . 05 level . Results The oligonucleotide aCGH identiﬁed a homozygous loss of PCDH17 in ESCC cell lines As expected , various small high - level ampliﬁcations ( log 2 ratio . 2 . 0 ) and homozygous deletions ( log 2 ratio , (cid:3) 2 . 0 ) , not previously S .

Among these newly identiﬁed regions , the homozygous loss at 13q21 . 2 , which is within the PCDH17 gene and located close to two possible TSGs reported previously , PCDH8 ( 13 ) and PCDH20 ( 11 ) , was detected in the KYSE890 and KYSE1170 cell lines ( Figure 1a and data not shown ) . To conﬁrm the homozygous loss of PCDH17 in those lines and determine whether this segment might be homozygously lost in other ESCC lines , we performed genomic PCR using primers designed for exons 1 – 4 of this gene . We detected a homozygous loss of a part of PCDH17 , between exons 1 and 3 , only in KYSE890 and KYSE1170 cells ( Figure 1b ) . Since no loss of PCDH17 had ever been documented in cancers including ESCC before , we examined whether this gene is a candidate TSG involved in tumourigenesis in the oesophagus . Frequent transcriptional silencing of PCDH17 in ESCC cell lines Next , we examined the mRNA expression of PCDH17 by means of the real - time quantitative reverse transcription – PCR in all ESCC cell lines and normal oesophagus . Compared with the normal oesophagus , the KYSE890 and KYSE1170 cells as well as most of the other ESCC lines without homozygous loss at 13q21 . 2 ( 39 of 41 , 95 . 1 % ) lacked expression of PCDH17 mRNA ( Figure 1c ) . Two ESCC cell lines ( KYSE110 and KYSE140 ) and normal oesophagus did express PCDH17 mRNA , suggesting the loss of expression in some tumours to result from mechanisms other than genomic deletion , including epigenetic events . Eleven of 41 lines showed a hemizygous loss pat - tern around PCDH17 on aCGH analysis , and 10 of them failed to express this gene ( Figure 1c and data not shown ) . We ﬁrst screened nucleotide substitutions within the protein - coding sequence of PCDH17 in a panel of 41 ESCC cell lines without homozygous de - letion of this gene and 50 ESCC primary tumours ( Table I ) . Only one heterozygous and one homozygous nucleotide substitution leading to a Gly / Arg change at codon 56 and a Glu / Lys change at codon 776 , respectively , were identiﬁed in KYSE70 and KYSE110 / KYSE200 cells , respectively . Two silent heterozygous nucleotide sub - stitutions detected in primary ESCC tumours were also observed in paired non - cancerous esophageal tissues ( Table I ) , suggesting those alteration to be single - nucleotide polymorphisms . No homozygous deletion was observed in 50 primary ESCC tumours . Although the observed alterations with amino acid changes have not been reported in the single - nucleotide polymorphism databases ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / SNP / and http : / / snp . ims . u - tokyo . ac . jp / ) , nucleotide sub - stitutions within the protein - coding sequence may not play a major role in the silencing of PCDH17 . As recognized recently , candidate TSGs are more frequently inac - tivated through epigenetic inactivation ( promoter methylation ) , or a combination of genetic ( mutations of one allele ) and epigenetic ( methylation of another allele ) inactivations , than biallelic genetic inactivation alone ( 6 ) . Since the CpGPLOT program ( http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / emboss / cpgplot / ) identiﬁed a CpG - rich region containing a CpG island around the transcriptional start site ( TSS ) of PCDH17 , we investigated whether DNA demethylation could restore the expres - sion of PCDH17 mRNA . Treatment of ESCC cell lines lacking PCDH17 expression with 5 - aza - 2 # - deoxycytidine restored PCDH17 mRNA expression ( Figure 1d ) , although we observed an enhancement Fig . 1 .

Results are shown with means ± SDs ( bars ) relative to the value for no treatment in each cell line . Frequent silencing of protocadherin 17 1029 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / c a r c i n / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 31 / 6 / 1027 / 2630005 b y gue s t on 14 M a r c h 2019 of PCDH17 mRNA expression by 5 - aza - 2 # - deoxycytidine given along with trichostatin A in some lines , suggesting that histone deacetylation does play some role in the transcriptional silencing of PCDH17 among methylated ESCC cells . Methylation of the PCDH17 CpG island in ESCC cell lines To show the potential role of methylation around the CpG island in the silencing of PCDH17 , we screened the methylation status around the PCDH17 CpG island ( Figure 2a ) in ESCC lines by means of the COBRA and BGS . Since a preliminary screening using the COBRA demonstrated that most of the CpG island was highly methylated in ESCC cell lines regardless of expression status of PCDH17 ( Figure 2b and supplementary Figure S2 is available at Carcinogenesis Online ) , we excluded those regions from further analysis and focused on the region around TSS ( regions 1 – 3 in Figure 2a ) . CpG sites around PCDH17 - TSS tended to be extensively methylated in the non - expressing cell lines , whereas PCDH17 - expressing ESCC lines were almost unmethylated or partially methylated ( Figure 2b and c ) . Because part of the CpG - rich region around the PCDH17 - TSS seems to be a target for methylation and closely related to transcriptional silencing of the gene , we tested this region for promoter activity using two fragments encompassing or within this region ( 978 and 171 bp ; fragments 1 and 2 , respectively , in Figure 2a ) in ESCC cells . Regard - less of the expression status of PCDH17 mRNA , a remarkable increase in transcriptional activity was a feature of constructs contain - ing fragment 1 ( Figure 2d ) , suggesting that the region around speciﬁc CpG sites exhibiting promoter activity is a potential target for DNA methylation for silencing of PCDH17 . Methylation of the PCDH17 promoter region in primary ESCC tumours To determine the extent to which aberrant methylation of PCDH17 might be also involved in silencing of the gene’s expression in primary ESCCs , we examined the methylation status of this gene in 13 frozen sections of primary ESCCs with corresponding non - cancerous esoph - ageal tissues by the COBRA of regions 1 and 2 ( Figures 2a and 3a ) . Aberrant methylation of PCDH17 was detected in 9 of 13 primary ESCC tissues ( 69 . 2 % ) predominantly in region 2 and was also de - tected in the corresponding non - cancerous esophageal tissues in two of those nine samples ( 22 . 2 % ) , suggesting the aberrant methylation of the PCDH17 promoter region to occur early in esophageal carcino - genesis . We performed BGS of regions 1 and 2 in individual alleles from representative primary ESCC tumours with corresponding non - cancerous tissues ( Figure 3b ) and conﬁrmed aberrant methylation in methylation - positive ESCC tumours but not in methylation - negative non - cancerous esophageal tissues in the COBRA . These ﬁndings in - dicate that the PCDH17 promoter’s methylation was not a simple artifact arising during the passage of cell lines in vitro . To compare PCDH17 methylation status with expression status , we carried out quantitative real - time reverse transcription – PCR and im - munohistochemistry in primary tumour samples and corresponding non - cancerous tissues , although non - cancerous tissue samples were unavailable within parafﬁn - embedded tissues in some of the 13 cases . Decreased PCDH17 mRNA expression in tumours compared with paired non - cancerous tissues was observed in four of seven cases ( 57 . 1 % ) with tumour - speciﬁc hypermethylation and in two of ﬁve cases ( 40 % ) without tumour - speciﬁc hypermethylation ( Figure 3c ) , although methylation status and mRNA expression status did not match in 5 of 13 cases . In order to determine the protein expression status of PCDH17 in primary ESCC tumours and non - cancerous esophageal mucosa , we performed an immunohistochemical analysis using a PCDH17 - speciﬁc antibody ( Figure 3d ; supplementary Figure S1 is available at Carcinogenesis Online ) . In non - tumourous esophageal mucosa , PCDH17 immunoreactivity was predominantly observed on membranes of epithelial cells in prickle cell layers as a dotted pattern . PCDH17 immunostaining was observed in some mesenchymal cells , e . g . endothelial cells . Immunohistochemical staining using representative cases of ESCC tumours with DNA meth - ylation and neighbouring non - cancerous tissues demonstrated that PCDH17 protein expression was detected in normal epithelial cells but not in tumour cells ( Figure 3d ) . Since silencing of PCDH17 pro - tein expression in tumour tissues was correlated with tumour - speciﬁc methylation ( P 5 0 . 476 , Fisher’s exact test ) even in nine paired anal - ysis sets , those results suggested that methylation within the promoter region of PCDH17 occurs in primary ESCC and partly contributes to the silencing of expression . Association between clinicopathologic characteristics and the PCDH17 protein expression To verify the downregulation of PCDH17 expression in primary ESCCs and to determine its clinicopathologic signiﬁcance , we further performed an immunohistochemical analysis of PCDH17 protein in 145 primary tumour tissues . Table II summarizes relationships be - tween the expression status of PCDH17 protein and clinicopatholog - ical features . Among the 145 ESCCs , 18 ( 12 . 4 % ) showed immunoreactivity to PCDH17 ( positive in Table II ; supplementary Figure S1 is available at Carcinogenesis Online ) , whereas 127 ( 87 . 6 % ) did not ( negative in Table II and Figure 3d ) . Negative PCDH17 expression was more frequent in male cases ( P 5 0 . 015 , v 2 test ) and in poorly differentiated tumours than in well / moderately differentiated tumours ( histopathological grading , P 5 0 . 032 , Fish - er’s exact test ) and tended to be more frequent in pN1 than pN0 tumours ( P 5 0 . 086 , v 2 test ) . However , the PCDH17 protein expres - sion in each tumour was not associated with other characteristics . Univariate analyses of overall survival with log - rank tests failed to demonstrate a signiﬁcant association between PCDH17 expression status and overall survival of patients ( supplementary Figure S3 is Table I .

However , no deaths occurred in the PCDH17 - positive group of patients ( n 5 10 ) with pN0 ESCC tumours during the study period , whereas 9 of 44 patients ( 20 . 5 % ) in the negative group died ( Figure 3e ) . No clinicopathological differ - ence was observed between the PCDH17 - positive and - negative groups ( supplementary Table S3 is available at Carcinogenesis Online ) in cases with pN0 ESCC tumours , suggesting negative PCDH17 immunoreactivity to be useful for predicting the selection of therapeutic approaches in this less advanced group . Suppression of cell proliferation and migration after restoration of PCDH17 expression To investigate whether restoration of PCDH17 expression would sup - press proliferation of ESCC cells lacking expression of the gene , we ﬁrst performed colony formation assays using transiently PCDH17 - transfected cells ( Figure 4a ) . Ten days after transfection and subse - quent selection of drug - resistant colonies , the numbers of large colo - nies produced by PCDH17 - transfected KYSE170 and KYSE200 cells decreased compared with those of empty vector - transfected counter - parts . Expectedly , immunoﬂuorescence staining demonstrated that ectopically expressed PCDH17 protein was mainly located at plasma membranes ( supplementary Figure S4 is available at Carcinogenesis Online ) . A cell proliferation assay was also performed for stably transfected KYSE170 and KYSE200 cells ( Figure 4b ) . Cells stably expressing FLAG - tagged PCDH17 ( Figure 4c ) grew slightly but signiﬁcantly slower than the empty vector - transfected cells . In ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorting analysis , an accumulation of cells in G 0 – G 1 phase and a decrease in S and G 2 – M phase cells but no increase in sub - G 1 phase cells was observed among PCDH17 - transfected KYSE170 and KYSE200 cells compared with mock - transfected counterparts ( Figure 4c ) , suggesting that PCDH17 contributes to the arrest of ESCC cells at the G 1 – S checkpoint without Fig . 2 .

In PCDH17 - transfected cells , an upward trend in p21 and p27 protein expression and a downward trend in CCND1 protein expression were observed compared with their control coun - terparts ( Figure 4c ) . Next , the effect of restoring PCDH17 expression on ESCC cell motility was assessed with a scratch wound assay . Stably PCDH17 - expressing KYSE170 cells spread along the wound edges signiﬁcantly slower than empty vector - transfected counterparts ( Figure 4d ) , indicating that PCDH17 also inhibits tumour cell migra - tion . Furthermore , a Matrigel invasion assay was performed to exam - ine the invasive potential of KYSE170 cells transfected with PCDH17 . The number of cells that migrated through the uncoated ( migration assay ) or Matrigel - coated ( invasion assay ) membrane into the lower chamber and the invasion index , the relative number of cells that migrated through the uncoated membrane compared with those that migrated through the Matrigel - coated membrane ( Figure 4d ) , were signiﬁcantly lower in the stably PCDH17 - expressing cells than in control cells , suggesting that PCDH17 also inhibits the invasive potential of ESCC cells . Discussion The introduction of higher density aCGH and the vast amounts of mapping data that have recently become available through the human genome effort have greatly facilitated the analysis of tumour - related ampliﬁed or deleted chromosomal regions . Since cell lines and xen - ografts are superior to primary tumour samples for the identiﬁcation of homozygous deletions and many of the most important TSGs have been discovered through the use of cell lines and xenografts ( 23 ) , we applied high - resolution oligonucleotide arrays to ESCC cell lines , an approach that provides high sensitivity and speciﬁcity in detecting cryptic homozygous losses , to identify novel TSGs . Homozygous loss of PCDH17 , which is located close to PCDH20 , another member of the protocadherin superfamily homozygously de - leted in a non - small - cell lung cancer cell line at 13q21 ( 11 ) , was detected in two ESCC cell lines . Notably , within the non - clustered d 2 subgroup ( PCDH8 , 10 , 17 , 18 and 19 ) of the . 70 members of the protocadherin family ( 10 ) , PCDH8 and PCDH10 have been reported as candidate TSGs ( 12 – 14 ) . However , a role for PCDH17 within the same subgroup in carcinogenesis has never been reported , prompting us to focus on its gene . The frequently reduced expression of PCDH17 is linked closely to hypermethylation of the CpG - rich region having promoter activity in ESCC cell lines , indicating that promoter methylation is one of the mechanisms for PCDH17’s inactivation in ESCC . There are partially methylated alleles in several cell lines with no expression and unme - thylated alleles in many primary ESCC tumours , indicating that other factors regulating transcription such as the modiﬁcation of histones , a lack of transcriptional activators or the presence of transcriptional repressors may contribute to the gene silencing especially in primary tumours . Although we detected several non - synonymous nucleic acid alterations in coding exons of PCDH17 in ESCC cell lines , it remains unclear whether they contribute to the silencing / inactivation of this gene because of a lack of evidence indicating those alterations to be somatic mutations in ESCC cells . Loss of expression or functional inactivation , caused by mutations or promoter methylation of members of the cadherin superfamily , e . g . CDH1 , CDH13 , C DH11 , PCDH - LKC , PCDH - c - A11 , PCDH8 and PCD10 , has been shown in a number of different cancer entities ( 12 – 14 , 24 – 30 ) , resulting in tumour cell invasion and metastasis ( 12 , 14 , 24 , 31 ) . Those results are complementary to ours and suggest that epigenetic inactivation of members of the cadherin superfamily including protocadherins in neoplasms could be widespread and more genes in this family may be targets for inactivation during tumouri - genesis , although protein structure , expression patterns in various tissues and physiologic function differ among members ( 10 ) . Notably , PCDH8 , PCDH17 , PCDH20 and PCDH9 around 13q21 . 1 locate con - tiguously , even though non - clustered protocadherin members , and PCDH8 and PCDH20 are reported to be candidate TSGs acting through genetic or epigenetic inactivation ( 11 , 13 ) , suggesting that the neighbouring protocadherins around 13q21 . 1 are broadly involved 8 and 26 ) examined in the COBRA for surgically resected primary ESCC tumours ( T ) and corresponding non - cancerous esophageal mucosa ( N ) .

Our promoter assay demonstrated that fragment containing a methylated region differing between PCDH17 - expressing and non - expressing ESCC cell lines and located upstream ( 5 # ) of exon 1 of PCDH17 showed a remarkable promoter activity . Therefore , sequen - ces within the 5 # part of TSS at least seem to be the target for the methylation - induced silencing of PCDH17 . In primary cases of ESCC , tumour samples were more frequently methylated especially in the promoter region of PCDH17 compared with paired non - tumourous samples , suggesting that aberrant methylation of the PCDH17 promoter region is not a cell line - speciﬁc event . In some cases , higher expression of PCDH17 mRNA was observed in meth - ylated tumours than in paired non - tumourous samples without meth - ylation , probably due to the expression of PCDH17 mRNA from the unmethylated portion of tumour cells as well as non - cancerous normal tissue components , such as epithelial cells in the prickle cell layer and endothelial cells in submucosa , contaminating the tumour samples . Immunohistochemical analysis in 145 primary ESCCs revealed frequent silencing of PCDH17 protein expression in tumour cells . Fig . 4 . Effects of restoration of PCDH17 expression on cell proliferation and migration / invasion in ESCC cells . ( a ) A C - terminally Myc - tagged construct containing PCDH17 ( pCMV - 3Tag4 - PCDH17 ) or empty vector ( pCMV - 3Tag4 - mock ) as a control was introduced into KYSE30 or KYSE170 cells , which lack expression of the PCDH17 gene due to hypermethylation of the CpG - rich region . Western blot analysis ( left ) using 10 l g of protein extract , anti - Myc antibody and the internal control antibody ( anti - b - actin ) showed that cells transiently transfected with pCMV - 3Tag4 - PCDH17 expressed Myc - tagged PCDH17 protein . Three weeks after transfection and subsequent selection of drug - resistant colonies in six - well plates ( right ) , the colonies formed by PCDH17 - transfected ESCC cells were less numerous than those formed by mock - transfected cells .

Immunoﬂuorescence cytochemistry using anti - FLAG antibody demonstrated almost all KYSE170 or KYSE200 cells stably transfected with pIRES - hGFPII - PCDH17 to express FLAG - tagged PCDH17 ( upper ) . A cell growth assay of stable transfectants using water - soluble tetrazolium salt after plating into 24 - well plates ( 1 (cid:4) 10 5 cells per well ) revealed the proliferative activity of PCDH17 - transfected cells to be less than that of the control counterparts .

Cells ( 2 (cid:4) 10 4 cells per well ) were transferred into the upper chamber , and the migrated or invasive cells on the lower surface of ﬁlters were ﬁxed , stained and counted after 48 h of incubation . Experiments were performed in triplicate . We assessed invasive potential by calculating an invasion index , which is the ratio of the percentage invasion through the Matrigel - coated ﬁlters relative to the migration through the uncoated ﬁlters of test cells over that in the control counterparts .

Notably , a signiﬁcant correlation existed between the expression of PCDH17 protein and histopathological grading and poorly differentiated tumours were negative for PCDH17 expression more frequently than were well - differentiated tumours . In neighbouring non - neoplastic esophageal epithelia , PCDH17 protein was expressed in regions containing dif - ferentiated cells ( prickle cell layer ) but not in those containing ac - tively dividing cells ( basal cell layer ) . In our preliminary multi - tissue mRNA expression analysis using various human tissues , relatively higher expression of PCDH17 mRNA compared with normal oesoph - agus was observed in brain , lung , pancreas and heart , but similar or lower expression was observed in most of other tissues and tissues with squamous epithelial cells , such as cervix and skin , showed sim - ilar PCDH17 mRNA expression level , suggesting PCDH17 to play some role in normal squamous epithelia ( supplementary Figure S6 is available at Carcinogenesis Online ) . Those ﬁndings suggest the ex - pression of PCDH17 to depend on the status of cellular differentiation and the silenced expression of PCDH17 to play some role during the de - differentiation of esophageal neoplasms . Although no signiﬁcant difference in overall survival was observed between cases with and without expression of PCDH17 protein in ESCC tumours , no deaths occurred in the PCDH17 - positive group of patients with pN0 ESCC tumours during the study period , whereas 20 . 5 % of patients in the negative group died . In addition , PCDH17 protein expression tended to be more frequently detected in pN0 ESCC tumours , suggesting PCDH17 - immunopositivity to be one of the signs of a less malignant phenotype at least for some subgroups of ESCC . In a previous mul - ticenter randomized controlled trial in Japan ( JCOG9204 ) to deter - mine whether postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy improves outcome in patients with ESCC undergoing radical surgery ( 32 ) , risk reduction by postoperative chemotherapy was remarkably observed only in the subgroup with pN1 . This result suggests that some high risk subgroups within pN0 cases , in which postoperative chemother - apy may be more desirable , should be detected by biomarkers for prediction of latent micrometastases and choosing the most favour - able options for treatment of individual ESCC patients , especially pN0 cases . Therefore , postoperative chemotherapy may be required for patients negative for PCDH17 expression in the primary tumour in cases of pN0 ESCC . To test this hypothesis , it will be necessary to analyse cohorts consisting of more cases of ESCC because only a small proportion of cases show PCDH17 staining . The tumour - suppressive function of PCDH17 in ESCC was inves - tigated by re - expression of this gene in ESCC cell lines in vitro . Colony - formation assays using transiently PCDH17 - transfected cells and growth assays using stably PCDH17 - transfected cells or siRNA - treated cells ( supplementary Figure S5 is available at Carcinogenesis Online ) showed an anti - proliferative activity of the PCDH17 protein . Stably PCDH17 - transfected cells demonstrated cell cycle arrest at the G 1 – S checkpoint . In addition , we observed that re - expression of PCDH17 induces inhibition of cell migration and invasion . Different from classic cadherins , it is known that protocadherins are not just simple cell adhesion proteins involved in homophilic interactions and their heterophilic interactions with other molecules may be more important for their various physiologic functions ( 10 , 33 , 34 ) . There - fore , PCDH17 may have multiple tumour - suppressive functions po - tentially contributing to cell – cell adhesion , signal transduction and growth control , although the exact function of PCDH17 is poorly deﬁned and no motif possibly associated with any speciﬁc function has been reported . In other protocadherins , various possible mecha - nisms for tumour suppression have been reported : PCDH10 inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis with an induction of multiple genes including p21 ( 14 ) , and PCDH24 inhibits the expression of some downstream targets of b - catenin including cyclin D1 ( 35 ) . Therefore , it is possible that some of the molecular pathways for tumour suppression are common to protocadherins including PCDH17 , although it remains unclear whether protocadherins directly or indirectly regulate those molecules related to the cell cycle and apoptosis . However , the tumour - suppressing activity of PCDH17 in vitro , together with its expression in normal esophageal epithelial cells , speciﬁcally at the prickle cell layer , and the correlation between the silenced PCDH17 expression in ESCC cells and poorer differen - tiation status , support the candidacy of this gene as a TSG for ESCC . Additional studies will be required to unravel the carcinogenic con - sequences of loss of PCDH17 function in human esophageal tissue .
