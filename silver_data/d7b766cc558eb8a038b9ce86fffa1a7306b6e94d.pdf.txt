Bassell 3 , John Condeelis 1 & Robert H . Singer 1 Localization of b - actin messenger RNA to sites of active actin polymerization modulates cell migration during embryogenesis , differentiation and possibly carcinogenesis 1 – 5 . This localization requires the oncofetal protein ZBP1 ( Zipcode binding protein 1 ) , which binds to a conserved 54 - nucleotide element in the 3 0 - untranslated region of the b - actin mRNA known as the ‘zipcode’ . ZBP1 promotes translocation of the b - actin transcript to actin - rich protrusions in primary ﬁbroblasts and neurons 6 , 7 . It is not known how the ZBP1 – RNA complex achieves asymmetric protein sorting by localizing b - actin mRNA . Here we show that chicken ZBP1 modulates the translation of b - actin mRNA . ZBP1 associates with the b - actin transcript in the nucleus and prevents premature translation in the cytoplasm by blocking translation initiation . Translation only occurs when the ZBP1 – RNA complex reaches its destination at the periphery of the cell . At the endpoint of mRNA transport , the protein kinase Src promotes translation by phos - phorylating a key tyrosine residue in ZBP1 that is required for binding to RNA . These sequential events provide both temporal and spatial control over b - actin mRNA translation , which is important for cell migration and neurite outgrowth . In order to characterize how the ZBP1 – RNA complex achieves asymmetric protein sorting , we established an in vitro cell model using the NG108 - 15 neuroblastoma cell line ( NG ) . As in primary embryonic ﬁbroblast or neuronal cells , ZBP1 colocalized with b - actin mRNA at the leading edge , in growth cone ﬁlopodia and along the neurites of differentiated NG cells 8 ( Fig . 1a , b , d , e ) . At the cell periphery , sites of colocalization were interspersed with regions where b - actin mRNA and ZBP1 were separated , suggesting release of the mRNA transcript ( Supplementary Fig . 1a – c ) . In the nucleus , ZBP1 was found in discrete foci , coinciding with the sites of b - actin mRNA transcription and indicating that ZBP1 associates with b - actin mRNA co - transcriptionally 9 , 10 ( Fig . 1c , f and Supplementary Fig . 1d – f ) . Awell - accepted paradigm of mRNA localization is that it precedes translation . We propose that assembly of a localized mRNA – protein complex occurs in the nucleoplasm , priming the mRNA to be translationally silenced when it reaches the cytoplasm . On the basis of this hypothesis , we tested recombinant ZBP1 for a role in regulating the translation of b - actin mRNA . In rabbit reticulocyte lysate , ZBP1 impaired translation of the b - actin transcript in a zipcode - dependent manner , without affecting RNA stability ( Fig . 1g and Supplementary Fig . 1g , h ) . Hence , the zipcode sequence seems to be essential for controlling both mRNA localization and translation . Similar to the RNA - binding protein hnRNP - K , ZBP1 impaired the formation of 80S ribosomal com - plexes on regulated transcripts in rabbit reticulocyte lysate , but the amount and positioning of the 48S complex remained unaffected 11 ( Supplementary Fig . 2a – d ) . These ﬁndings conﬁrm ZBP1 as a bona ﬁde translational regulator that interferes with translation by block - ing translation initiation . We then attempted to validate the role of ZBP1 as a zipcode - dependent translational regulator in vivo . Knockdown of endogen - ous ZBP1 by short interfering ( si ) RNA enhanced translation from reporter transcripts in a zipcode - dependent manner ( Fig . 1h , i and Supplementary Fig . 1i ) . Speciﬁcity was further conﬁrmed by trans - fecting an siRNA - insensitive chicken ZBP1 ( ZBP1 insens ) into NG cells . ZBP1 insens restored the translational repression of transcripts LETTERS Figure1 | ZBP1 associates with b - actin mRNA inNG cells and modulates its translation . a – f , Colocalization of ZBP1 – GFP and b - actin mRNA in differentiated NG cells : leading edge ( arrow in a , d ) , neurite extension ( arrow in b , e ) and discrete nuclear foci ( arrow in c , f ) .

Vol 438 | 24 November 2005 | doi : 10 . 1038 / nature04115 512 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group containing the human b - actin mRNA zipcode ( Fig . 1h , i ) . Hence , ZBP1 is a conserved trans - acting factor that controls translation of b - actin mRNA in vivo . To achieve asymmetric protein sorting in neurites , a regulatory mechanism must exist to abrogate translational repression by ZBP1 once the mRNA has been localized . Sequence analysis of the ZBP1 protein reveals a possible SH3 - binding motif ( VP 4 SS ) in close proximity to a KH - domain essential for binding to the zipcode 7 . The identical motif is found in the cell - adhesion protein paxillin , where it serves as a docking site for Src kinase 12 . Like paxillin , we conﬁrmed that ZBP1 is a substrate for Src in vivo . Exogenous ZBP1 was tyrosine - phosphorylated by endogenous Src . Overexpression of constitutively active Src ( KP , which contains a K249Q and P250G mutation ) increased ZBP1 phosphorylation , whereas inactivated Src ( containing a Y416F mutation ) had no effect ( Fig . 2a ) . In vitro and in vivo phosphorylation experiments identiﬁed Tyr 396 as the ZBP1 residue phosphorylated by Src ( Fig . 2b , Supplementary Fig . 3 and Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) . Phosphorylation of endogenous ZBP1 in vivo and the recombinant protein in vitro was veriﬁed with a speciﬁc anti - peptide antibody directed against phosphorylated Tyr 396 ( Supplementary Fig . 4c , d ) . Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues outside the RNA - binding domain has been suggested to decrease RNA binding of the KH - domain - containing proteins hnRNP - K and Sam68 ( refs 13 , 14 ) . To address the role of Src in regulating ZBP1 function , phosphorylated ZBP1 and non - phosphorylatable ZBP1 ( containing a Y396F mutation ) were probed for subcellular localization and zipcode binding . No obvious differences between the wild - type and mutant protein were found ( data not shown ) . However , zipcode binding was signiﬁcantly decreased as a result of ZBP1 tyrosine phosphorylation ( Supplementary Fig . 5a – c ) . In contrast to the wild - type protein , ZBP1 - Y396F retained signiﬁcantly higher binding efﬁciency , suggesting that phosphorylation of Tyr 396 interferes with RNA binding ( Fig . 2c ) . ZBP1 – RNA complexes isolated from cells and analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription ( RT – PCR ) revealed that the association of endogenous b - actin mRNA with ZBP1 was unaffected by the Y396F mutation . However , replacement of Tyr 396 with glutamate signiﬁcantly impaired the association of ZBP1 with endogenous b - actin mRNA ( Fig . 2d ) . This indicates that tyrosine phosphorylation or the mimicking of phosphorylation by glutamate substitution interferes with the binding of b - actin mRNA both in vitro and in vivo . The control of b - actin mRNA binding through tyrosine phos - phorylation suggests that Src might also regulate translational repression through ZBP1 . This was supported by our ﬁnding that increased Srcactivity leads to increased translation only from zipcode reporter mRNA in vivo ( Fig . 2e ) . Cells that were depleted of endogenous ZBP1 by siRNA showed signiﬁcantly increased trans - lation , whereas replacement with ZBP1 insens or ZBP1 - Y396F , which are both insensitive to siRNA , decreased translation ( Fig . 2f ) . Notably , the mutant was slightly more efﬁcient at reducing trans - lation . Amino acid replacement of Tyr 396 apparently counteracts the release of b - actin mRNA , as RNA binding was unaffected by the Y396F mutation both in vitro and in vivo . Together , our data suggest that Src phosphorylation of Tyr 396 abolishes translational repression by decreasing ZBP1 binding to b - actin mRNA . In order for translational repression to be spatially regulated , Src should associate with and phosphorylate ZBP1 at the endpoint of b - actin mRNA transport . We therefore investigated the interaction between Src and ZBP1 using immunoprecipitation experiments ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . This association was impaired by intro - ducing a negative charge C - terminal to the conserved poly - proline motif , which has been shown to interfere with SH3 - mediated binding 15 ( Supplementary Fig . 6b – d ) . We next analysed the spatial organization of the ZBP1 – Src interaction by ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ; Fig . 3a – e ) . Acceptor photobleaching using ZBP1 – cyan ﬂuorescent protein ( CFP ) and Src – yellow ﬂuorescent protein ( YFP ) fusion proteins as donor and acceptor molecules , respectively , revealed a signiﬁcant energy transfer and thus an association between Src and ZBP1 in close proximity to ﬁlopodia and in the growth cones of differentiated NG cells ( Fig . 3e , arrows and arrowhead , respectively ) . FRET signal was not detected outside the photobleached region or when using free YFP ( Supplementary Fig . 7a – f ) . The spatial organization of the Src – ZBP1 interaction resembled the colocaliza - tion of b - actin mRNA and ZBP1 along dendrites and within the growth cone ﬁlopodia of primary hippocampal neurons 3 , 16 . We next investigated whether disruption of translational regu - lation by ZBP1 had a phenotypic consequence . Previous work has suggested that b - actin mRNA localization might regulate the density of F - actin in dendritic protrusions , thereby implying that the spatial regulation of translation can modulate neuronal outgrowth by providing monomeric actin and other actin - related proteins 8 , 17 . As predicted , the scoring of differentiated NG cells on the basis of cellular extension length showed that knockdown of ZBP1 signiﬁ - cantly impaired neurite outgrowth ( Fig . 3f – h and Supplementary Fig . 8a – f ) . Neuronal outgrowth recovered upon expression of ZBP1 that was insensitive to siRNA . In contrast , expression of non - phosphorylatable ZBP1 - Y396F , which is impaired in releasing the mRNA , did not restore neuronal outgrowth . Similarly , overexpres - sion of ZBP1 - Y396F interfered with neuronal outgrowth in primary hippocampal neurons , supporting the physiological relevance of the observed phenotype ( Fig . 3i – k ) .

NATURE | Vol 438 | 24 November 2005 LETTERS 513 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group We would expect that this suppression of outgrowth results directly from the inability to locally translate b - actin mRNA , as the non - phosphorylatable mutant should act as a dominant negative by failing to release translational repression at the endpoint of mRNA transport . In order to test this prediction , we assessed the levels of peripheral b - actin protein in spreading NG cells upon overexpres - sion of ZBP1 – GFP or ZBP1 - Y396F – GFP ( Fig . 3l – p and Supplemen - tary Fig . 9a – h ) . b - Actin protein at the cell periphery was detected by indirect immunoﬂuorescence using a b - actin - speciﬁc antibody ( see Supplementary Fig . 9a – h ) . Enhanced expression of wild - type ZBP1 increased the actin signal at the leading edge of most spreading cells ( , 70 % of scored cells ) . In contrast , exogenous expression of ZBP1 - Y396F reduced peripheral actin intensity in over 90 % of the scored cells . These observations indicate that the cellular amount of peripheral b - actin protein is regulated through tyrosine phosphoryl - ation of ZBP1 . Therefore , spatial control of b - actin protein levels results in proper neuronal differentiation . Our ﬁndings emphasize the temporal and spatial relationship between mRNA localization and translation . If b - actin mRNA translation were not silenced , polysome formation would initiate immediately upon nuclear egress . This would make translocation of the mRNA problematic , as polysomes are essentially immobile within the isotropic network of cytoskeletal structures 18 . Although the association with nuclear factors may be important for preventing b - actin translation in the cytoplasm 19 – 23 , equally important is the mechanism that relieves this repression at the right time and place . Hence , ZBP1 must be removed from b - actin mRNA at the endpoint of transport . We propose that this occurs when ZBP1 comes into proximity with Src , as Src phosphorylation of ZBP1 disrupts RNA binding and activates translation . Given that Src activity is restricted to the cell periphery , local activation of b - actin translation can be modulated solely through the spatially restricted activity of the kinase 24 , 25 . Our ﬁndings indicate that a sequence of regulatory events including ( 1 ) ‘nuclear priming’ , ( 2 ) translational silencing that allows cytoplasmic sorting of transcripts , and ( 3 ) spatially controlled translational de - repression of a localized transcript have evolved as a common mechanism that can have profound physio - logical consequences for cellular asymmetry . METHODS Cell culture , transfection and antibodies . NG108 - 15 cells and 293 cells were cultured in DMEM medium ( with 10 % fetal bovine serum ) , containing 1 % HAT ( hypoxanthine , aminopterine , thymidine ) supplement for the culturing of NG - hybridomas . NG cells were differentiated by reducing serum levels ( to 1 % ) and plating on a poly - L - lysine / laminin matrix . For details see Supplementary Methods .
