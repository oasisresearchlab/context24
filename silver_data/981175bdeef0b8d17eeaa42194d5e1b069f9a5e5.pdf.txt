407 AB toxins deliver their enzymatically active A domain to the cytosol . Some AB - toxins are able to penetrate cellular membranes from endosomes where the low pH triggers their translocation . One such toxin is diphtheria toxin and important features of its translocation mechanism have been unraveled during the last year . Other toxins depend on retrograde transport through the secretory pathway to the ER before translocation , and recent findings suggest that these toxins take advantage of the ER translocation machinery normally used for transport of cellular proteins . In addition , the intracellular targets of many of these toxins have been identified recently .

AbbreviationsCNF1 cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 EF edema factor GPI glycosylphosphatidylinositol LF lethal factor PA protective antigen SNAP - 25 synaptosomal - associated membrane protein of 25 kDa TGN trans Golgi network VAMP vesicle - associated membrane protein Introduction A number of proteins from plants and bacteria are highly toxic to mammalian cells because of their ability to enter the cytosol and attack essential constituents ( for a review see [ 1 ] ) . The majority of these toxins are referred to as AB - toxins because of their structural organization ( sum - marized in Figure 1 ) [ 1 ] . The A moiety generally has enzymatic activity and modifies a cellular target upon entry into the cytosol ( Table 1 ) [ 1 ] , which leads to cell death or other effects on cellular physiology . The B moi - ety , consisting of one or more subunits , binds the toxin to cell - surface receptors and can also play a role in the translocation of the A moiety to the cytosol . Examples of intracellular targets are ribosomes , actin , small GTP - bind - ing proteins like Rho , and heterotrimeric G - proteins [ 1 ] . A recent discovery is the finding that the anthrax toxin lethal factor cleaves mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase ( MAPKK ) [ 2 , 3 ] Commonly , an AB - toxin is synthesised in an inactive form that is activated by proteolytic processing ( Figure 1 , [ 4 ] ) . Some toxins are cleaved by the producing organism ( e . g . cholera toxin , ricin , clostridial neurotoxins ) at a region between two cysteine residues [ 4 ] . In other cases ( e . g . diphtheria toxin , Shiga toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A ) , such processing is performed by furin , which is expressed by the target cell [ 4 ] . Other toxins ( e . g . anthrax toxins and Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin ) depend on proteolytic pro - cessing of the B moiety to expose a site that then binds the A moiety non - covalently [ 4 ] . In this article , we describe strategies employed by AB - toxins when entering cells , emphasizing recent discoveries in the field . Penetration of protein toxins into cells Pål Ø Falnes * and Kirsten Sandvig † Figure 1 Structural organization of AB - toxins . Proteolytic cleavage of the toxin is required , in many cases , for activity , and such cleavage often occurs in the region between the A ( black ) and the B ( gray ) subunits . Either the toxin has been cleared by a protease from the plant or the bacterium that produces the toxin ( indicated by open arrows ) or a protease ( usually furin ) from the target cell cleaves the toxin ( indicated by closed arrows ) . Proteolytic cleavage often results in a toxin with an enzymatically active part linked to the rest of the molecule by a disulfide bond . However , the cleavage of the anthrax toxin B moiety by furin leads to the dissociation of part of the molecule and exposure of a site where the A moiety binds . In the cases where no cleavage is indicated , it is possible that cleavage takes place .

For instance , the receptor for diphtheria toxin is the uncleaved precursor of the heparin - binding EGF - like growth factor [ 5 ] ; the receptor for Pseudomonas exotoxin A is the a 2 - macroglobulin recep - tor [ 6 ] ; Shiga toxin binds to the glycolipid Gb3 [ 7 ] and cholera toxin binds to GM1 [ 8 ] . In the case of plant toxins , like ricin , they usually bind to carbohydrates [ 9 ] , regardless of whether they are attached to lipids or proteins . The receptor , in addition to providing binding sites at the cell surface , has several other functions in the intoxication process . Firstly , if the receptor is internalized efficiently , for instance from clathrin - coated pits ( see below ) , the toxin is also rapidly taken up . Importantly , receptor expression might be under regulation by growth factors / cytokines . This is the case for the Shiga toxin receptor ( Gb3 ) [ 9 ] , and it seems to play an important role in hemolytic uremic syndrome ( HUS ) caused by Escherichia coli that synthesize Shiga - like toxins and cause food poisoning [ 10 ] . Secondly , the toxin receptor is impor - tant for targeting of the toxin to the organelle before it enters the cytosol . An example is the Shiga - toxin receptor , where the lipid composition of the receptor is essential for retrograde toxin transport [ 9 , 11 ] . A third point is that the receptor may play a direct role in toxin penetration through the membrane . In the case of diphtheria toxin , the intact receptor seems to play an important role in effi - cient translocation across biological membranes . If the transmembrane or cytoplasmic domain of the receptor is replaced by a GPI ( glycosylphosphatidylinositol ) anchor , the efficiency of toxin translocation across the membrane is considerably reduced [ 12 ] . Point mutations in the receptor also appear to inhibit translocation [ 13 ] . Endocytosis and intracellular transport of protein toxins Although exceptions exist where a toxin seems to pene - trate directly from the cell surface into the cytosol ( e . g . Bordetella pertussis invasive adenylate cyclase ) [ 14 ] , most toxins are endocytosed , although by different mech - anisms [ 9 , 15 ] , before translocation to the cytosol . Uptake from the cell surface can take place through clathrin - dependent and - independent mechanisms . For example , cells expressing a mutant form of dynamin , which blocks uptake from clathrin - coated pits and caveolae , are protect - ed against diphtheria toxin bound to the wild - type receptor [ 16 , 17 ] but are not protected against diphtheria toxin bound to an engineered , GPI - anchored form of the receptor [ 17 ] . This result , in combination with other data , suggests that clathrin - dependent endocytosis is essential for efficient intoxication by diphtheria toxin bound to the wild - type receptor [ 16 , 17 ] . In contrast to ricin , which is endocytosed by all available mechanisms [ 15 ] , Shiga toxin ( despite being bound to a glycolipid receptor [ 9 ] ) and Pseudomonas exotoxin A [ 18 ] , are internalized from clathrin - coated pits . Also , a fraction of cholera toxin is internalized by this pathway [ 19 ] . Although most toxins need to be endocytosed before translocation to the cytosol , in many cases the mechanism by which this occurs has not been investigated . Several toxins are able to enter the cytosol from acidic endosomes , whereas others seem to be transported to the Golgi apparatus and the ER , before translocation takes place ( Figure 2 ) . These toxins , from both acidic endo - somes and the Golgi and ER , might circumvent late endosomes and use a more direct pathway to the Golgi apparatus . The exact pathway is not known [ 15 , 20 •• , 21 ] , but it seems to be dependent on the GTP - binding protein dynamin [ 22 ] . However , retrograde transport of toxins through the Golgi apparatus to the ER may take place through more than one mechanism . Some toxins have a KDEL sequence ( e . g . cholera toxin , Pseudomonas exotoxin A ) , which might bind to KDEL receptors and facilitates retrograde trans - port by a COPI - dependent mechanism [ 9 , 23 ] . However , other toxins do not have such a sequence ( e . g . ricin , Shiga 408 Membrane permeability Table 1 Mode of action of some AB toxins .

The translocation process How soluble , hydrophilic proteins are able to cross the bar - rier presented by the hydrophobic membrane is a fundamental problem in biology , and the protein toxins have developed different strategies to solve it . Some pro - tein toxins appear to carry with them the machinery required for translocation , whereas others are strictly dependent on cellular components . Diphtheria toxin — a paradigm for toxin translocation The mechanism of toxin penetration of a cellular mem - brane is best understood in the case of diphtheria toxin , which requires low endosomal pH for translocation . Both the A and the B moieties of the toxin unfold at low pH [ 24 ] , leading to the exposure of hydrophobic domains and an increased tendency to interact with membrane lipids [ 25 , 26 ] . Also , when diphtheria toxin is bound to the cell surface , and subsequently exposed to low pH ( there - by mimicking the conditions in the endosome ) , an immediate translocation of the A moiety to the cytosol is induced [ 27 , 28 ] . Thus , the low pH encountered by diph - theria toxin in the endosome triggers the translocation of the A moiety to the cytosol . Introduction of disulfide bonds at several locations in the A fragment blocked this translocation [ 29 ] , indicating that unfolding is a prerequi - site for penetration into the cytosol . However , although the translocation of the mutant A moieties was blocked , the disulfide bond connecting the A and the B chains was still reduced upon exposure of the toxin to acidic pH . This indicates that reduction takes place at an early stage in the translocation process [ 30 ] , most likely through exposure of the interfragment disulfide bond to the reduc - ing mileu of the cytosol ( Figure 3 ) . It has been suggested that diphtheria - toxin entry involves a synchronous release of a large quantity of A chain molecules into the cytosol , possibly through rupture of endosomes , which results in the immediate inhibition of protein syn - thesis [ 31 ] . However , recent studies indicate that at low toxin concentrations a single toxin molecule can enter a cell and optimal protein synthesis inhibition requires prolonged action of the toxin in the cytosol [ 32 , 33 • ] . Diphtheria toxin is able to form cation - selective channels at low pH both in the plasma membrane of cells [ 34 , 35 ] and in lipid membranes [ 36 ] . The toxin B moiety consists of an amino - terminal , a - helical transmembrane / translocation ( T ) domain and a carboxy - terminal receptor - binding ( R ) domain with a b - sheet structure . A part of the T domain , comprising two helices ( denoted TH8 and TH9 ) and the loop connecting them , can form a cation channel with the same characteristics as that formed by the entire T domain in planar lipid bilayers [ 37 ] ( Figure 3 ) . Although the effi - ciency of channel formation by the TH8 / 9 helical hairpin alone was low , this observation indicates that TH8 / 9 com - prises the minimal channel - forming entity . The exact role , if any , of channel formation in translocation of the A moiety to the cytosol remains unclear , as Lanzrein et al . [ 12 ] pre - sented evidence that channel formation may not be strictly required . An important step in T - domain insertion is the low pH - induced protonation of residues Glu349 and Asp352 at the tip of the TH8 / 9 helical hairpin , thereby neu - tralizing the charge of these residues and facilitating their translocation across the lipid bilayer , concomitant with the membrane insertion of the two helices [ 38 ] ( Figure 3 ) . A Penetration of protein toxins into cells Falnes and Sandvig 409 Figure 2 Intracellular transport of protein toxins . The toxin binds to a cell surface receptor ( Y shaped ) through its B moiety ( gray ) . The toxin A moiety ( black ) is , in some cases ( a ) , translocated to the cytosol from endosomes , whereas in other cases ( b ) , further transport , most probably all the way to the ER , is required for translocation . The fate of the toxin receptor has not been addressed in this cartoon . Endosome Golgi Anthrax toxin Diphtheria toxin Clostridial neurotoxins Ricin Shiga toxin Cholera toxin Pertussis toxin ER TGN A A A A A A B B B B Current Opinion in Cell Biology ( a ) ( b ) recent study showed that the T domain interacts with pro - teins in a ‘molten globule’ state ( e . g . the unfolded A moiety ) , suggesting that the T domain may work as a chap - erone in the translocation process [ 39 •• ] . The channel - forming properties of the T domain in planar lipid bilayers have proved useful for elucidating the mech - anism of toxin translocation . Senzel et al . [ 40 ] found that an oligopeptide containing a hexahistidine stretch was able to close the channel from the trans side ( the side opposite of where the protein was added ) when fused to the amino ter - minus of the T domain , indicating that the amino terminal part of the T domain is translocated across the lipid bilayer . Remarkably , using channel closure as a marker for mem - brane translocation , it was demonstrated that the A fragment also crossed the membrane in this system [ 41 •• ] . Thus , the toxin itself provides sufficient machinery for translocation of the A moiety across the lipid bilayer , but as discussed , the receptor seems to modulate the translocation process in the living cell . The translocation of other toxins The translocation of surface - bound toxins to the cytosol upon exposure to low pH would provide convincing evi - dence that a toxin enters the cytosol from endosomes . Such low pH - induced translocation has been demonstrat - ed for the anthrax toxins [ 42 ] and the cytotoxic necrotizing toxin 1 ( CNF1 ) [ 43 ] , as well as for diphtheria toxin . Anthrax toxin consists of either of two A moieties : the edema factor ( EF ) or the lethal factor ( LF ) . These factors associate in a mutually exclusive manner with a common B moiety , the protective antigen ( PA ) , to form edema toxin and lethal toxin . To expose the binding site for LF or EF , PA must be cleaved by furin [ 44 ] ( Figure 1 ) , and this cleav - age also induces the formation of a PA heptamer . Each molecule in the PA heptamer associates with one molecule of EF or LF [ 45 • ] . Upon exposure to low pH , the effector moieties translocate to the cytosol , whereas the PA oligomer inserts into the membrane and forms cation - selective channels [ 42 ] . As with diphtheria toxin , the role of the channel formation is not known , and unfolding of the A moieties appears to be a requirement for transloca - tion to the cytosol [ 46 • ] . The entry of several AB - type toxins , including diphtheria and anthrax toxins , into cells is inhibited by compounds elevating the pH of acidic endosomes [ 9 ] . However , this does not necessarily mean that the toxin enters the cytosol directly from endosomes . The toxic effect of Pseudomonas exotoxin A , even when furin - cleaved , is blocked by pH - ele - vating drugs [ 47 , 48 ] . This toxin contains an ER - retention - like sequence that is absolutely required for its toxicity [ 49 ] , and the low pH in the Golgi [ 50 , 51 ] may be important for intoxication . On the other hand , lack of low pH - induced translocation from the plasma membrane does not necessarily imply that a toxin is not translocated from endosomes ; the translocation process may require factors that are only present in endosomes . In the case of the clostridial neurotoxin tetanus toxin , toxicity is inhibited by bafilomycin A1 , which elevates endosomal pH [ 52 ] . It is likely that this toxin enters the cytosol from endosomes , as the toxic effect is not abrogated by brefeldin A , which dis - rupts the Golgi apparatus and inhibits the toxic effect of several toxins that are believed to enter the cytosol from the ER after transport through the Golgi apparatus [ 9 ] . 410 Membrane permeability Figure 3 S S A B TH8 TH9 HS SH UnfoldingInsertionReductionPartial translocation Complete translocation Refolding TH8 TH9 SH SH Low pH Current Opinion in Cell Biology Cytosol Toxin ( a ) ( b ) Glu349 Asp352 A model of diphtheria toxin translocation . ( a ) In the first step of the translocation process , the toxin molecule unfolds in response to low pH , leading to ( b ) membrane insertion of part of the T domain of the B moiety and a partial translocation of the A fragment to the cytosol . The insertion of the T domain is thought to be initiated by the protonation of the acidic residues Glu349 and Asp352 at the tip of the TH8 / 9 helical hairpin . The amino - terminal part of the T domain and the carboxy - terminal part of the A fragment are translocated across membrane , and the disulfide bond connecting them is reduced , most probably by the reducing mileu in the cytosol . The final step is the translocation of the remainder of the A fragment to the cytosol , where it refolds . The model is intended to integrate some of the data obtained in cells [ 29 , 30 ] and in lipid membranes [ 38 , 40 , 41 •• ] . Ricin , Shiga toxin , cholera toxin , and pertussis toxin seem to enter the cytosol via the Golgi and the ER . These toxins may take advantage of the existing translocation machinery in the ER membrane [ 53 ] , such as the Sec61 translocon [ 54 ] . The ER - to - cytosol translocation is best understood in the case of ricin . When a signal for ER - associated glycosylation was introduced into the ricin A chain and the resulting toxin incubated with cells , a substantial fraction of the toxin trans - ported to the Golgi apparatus was glycosylated [ 55 ] . Glycosylated molecules could also be recovered from the cytoplasmic fraction , indicating that the molecules had passed through the ER . Interestingly , part of the glycosylat - ed ricin could be coimmunoprecipitated with anti - Sec61 antibodies [ 56 • ] . Also , when the ricin A chain was expressed and imported into the ER in yeast , mutations in the protea - some and mutations in Sec61 inhibited protein export out of the ER and caused a reduction in the degradation of the ricin A chain [ 57 ] . These findings indicate that ricin is translocated out of the ER by the machinery that is used for the disposal of misfolded proteins [ 54 ] and the toxic effect is provided by ricin molecules that are able to avoid degrada - tion . This is further substantiated by the finding that the toxic effect of ricin is potentiated by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin [ 56 • ] . The observation that the intro - duction of a disulfide bond into the ricin A fragment inhibits the toxic effect [ 58 ] suggests that unfolding of the toxin is required for translocation to the cytosol . Conclusions Over the last couple of years , considerable progress has been made in unraveling the mechanisms of toxin entry into cells . Recent discoveries indicate that several toxins either have the ability to penetrate membranes under cer - tain conditions or to exploit translocation systems already present in the cell for traversing the cellular membranes . The low pH in endosomes triggers membrane penetration of several toxins , such as the anthrax and diphtheria toxins . The toxin receptors may be important for this translocation process . Other toxins , for example ricin , are transported all the way to the ER , where they utilize the translocation machinery of this organelle to enter the cytosol . However , many important questions remain to be answered , and for some toxins virtually nothing is known about their pene - tration mechanism . One of the major challenges for future research will be the identification of the cellular compo - nents involved in such processes .

Several different proteins that are in a partly folded , molten - globule state at low pH bind to the diphtheria toxin T domain and induce its conver - sion from a shallow membrane - inserted form into its transmembrane form .

Infect Immun 1999 , 67 : 1853 - 1859 . The stoichiometry of the interaction between anthrax toxin LF and PA was investigated . Singh et al . found that each subunit in the PA heptamer was able to bind and internalize one molecule of LF . 46 .

An assay for studying the low pH - induced translocation of the anthrax toxin effector proteins to the cytosol was developed . It is demonstrated here that the introduction of disulfide bonds or the induction of tight folding through ligand binding inhibits the translocation of proteins to the cytosol by the anthrax toxin pathway , indicating that considerable unfolding is a prerequisite for translocation to occur . 47 .

A sulfation signal fused to the ricin A chain is used as a tool to label with radioactive sulfate molecules that have reached the Golgi apparatus , and a signal for ER - specific glycosylation is used as a marker for transport of the sulfated A chain to the ER . Under a number of conditions , a good correla - tion between transport to the ER and the cytotoxic effect was observed . Also , sulfated ( both glycosylated and non - glycosylated ) ricin could be immunoprecipitated with anti - Sec61 antibodies , suggesting that the Sec61 translocaton may have a role in the translocation of ricin to the cytosol . 57 .
