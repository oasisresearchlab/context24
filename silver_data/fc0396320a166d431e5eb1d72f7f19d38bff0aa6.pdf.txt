Introduction The 53 - kDa insulin receptor substrate protein ( IRSp53 ) is part of a regulatory network that organizes the actin cytoskeleton in response to stimulationbysmallGTPases , promotingformationofactin - richcellpro - trusions such as ﬁ lopodia and lamellipodia [ 1 – 3 ] . Overexpression or mi - croinjection of wild - type IRSp53 drives cytoskeletal rearrangement [ 4 ] , resulting in increased ﬁ lopod formation . IRSp53 interacts with Rho GTPases through its Rac Binding Domain ( RCB ) , while its SH3 domain binds to WAVE2 [ 5 , 6 ] , Mena / VASP , Eps8 [ 7 , 8 ] , mDia [ 9 ] , espin [ 10 ] , DRLPA [ 11 ] , Shank - 1 [ 11 , 12 ] and synaptopodin [ 13 ] . IRSp53 also inter - acts with the Rac GEF Tiam1 and Eps8 , which forms a Rac GEF complex with other members [ 7 , 8 ] . An important discovery in understanding IRSp53 was the character - ization of theIMD ( IRSp53 / MIM Homology Domain ) [ 14 ] . TheIMD com - prises a 250 amino acid domain at the N terminus of both IRSp53 and MIM - B [ 15 ] . IMD can induce ﬁ lopodia formation in cells , both when expressed in isolation , and in the context of full length IRSp53 . Puri ﬁ ed recombinant IMD bundles actin ﬁ laments in vitro , and it was postulated that the actin bundling property was critical to IMD function [ 14 ] . IMD shows structural similarity to BAR domains , which bind to membranes of a speci ﬁ c curvature and can be curvature inducing [ 16 – 19 ] . Positively charged lysines are concentrated at the ends of the IMD [ 5 , 15 , 19 , 20 ] and are important for interaction between the IMD and the membrane . These results suggest that the IMD can enhance ﬁ lopodia formation by simply bundlingactin ﬁ laments atthe cell periphery . However , more re - centworkhassuggestedthattheIMDcanbindtoanddeformmembrane phospholipids and questioned the relevance of the actin interaction [ 5 , 20 ] . The role of IRSp53 in Rac - dependent activation of Scar / WAVE2 was studied using liposomes made with PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 [ 5 ] . The same group found that IMD interacts by nonspeci ﬁ c electrostatic binding with a range of phospholipids including PS , PI ( 3 ) P , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . In another recent paper , a similar method was undertaken to understand MIM and IRSp53 – IMD interactions with membranes [ 20 ] . Initially two different splice variants of MIM – IMD ( long and short ) were found , with four additional amino acids at the distal ends of the dimer in the IMD - L .

They also found that IMD has speci ﬁ city for interaction with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 that was clustered in model membranes . The primary aim of this work was to quantify the binding properties of the IMD to model membranes . We have prepared large unilamellar vesicles ( with 200 nm diameter ) containing different combination of PS , PC and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 lipids investigating the charge - dependency of the binding . The interaction between IMD and the lipid vesicles were followed by in vitro ﬂ uorescence - based assays like ﬂ uorescence reso - nance energy transfer , ﬂ uorescence quenching or TNS ﬂ uorescence as - says . In our current work we present these assays as a suitable tool to investigate the binding interactions between IMD and lipids . Since actin ﬁ laments are important in ﬁ lopodia formation , we also explored how the polymerization state of actin affects the lipid binding of the IMD . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Chemicals KCl , MgCl 2 , CaCl 2 , NaOH , Mops , Tris , N - ( ( ( iodoacetyl ) amino ) ethyl ) - 5 - naphthylamine - 1 - sulfonate ( IAEDANS ) , acrylamide and phalloidin were obtained from Sigma Chem . Co . ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) . ATP and 2 - mercaptoethanol were obtained from MERCK ( Darmstadt , Germany ) and NaN 3 was purchased from Fluka ( Switzerland ) . 2 - p - toluidinyl - naphtylene - 6 - sulphonate ( TNS ) and DiO was purchased from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . 2 . 2 . Protein and lipid preparation Plasmids pGEX4T2 containing the coding sequence of the IMD domain of IRSp53 were transformed and puri ﬁ ed in the methionine - auxotroph strain E . coli as described previously [ 19 ] . The four lysine to glutamic acid mutant IMD ( K142E , K143E , K146E , K147E [ 19 ] ) ( K4E – IMD ) was also cloned into the same vec - tor and puri ﬁ ed similarly . Acetone - dried powder of rabbit skeletal muscle was obtained as de - scribedpreviously [ 21 ] and actin wasprepared accordingtothemethod of Spudich and Watt [ 22 ] . Globular actin ( G - actin ) or phalloidin stabi - lized ﬁ lamentous actin ( F - actin ) were used in the assays . Phospholipids from bovine brain were purchased from the Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabama , USA ) : phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) , phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , L - α - phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) . Large unilamellar vesicules ( LUVETs ) of various compositions were made by an extrusion technique [ 23 – 25 ] . Lipids were dissolved in chlo - roform and were dried in a glass tube under a stream of nitrogen . PIP 2 , which had been resuspended in deionized water , was added to dried lipids , along with enough deionized water to produce the desired ﬁ nal concentration ; all lipids were then resuspended by vortexing . After ﬁ ve cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing in 37 °C water bath , samples were passed 10 times through a polycarbonate ﬁ lter ( 200 nm pore size ) in an Extruder ( Avestin , Ottawa , ON , Canada ) . In order to check the effect of the extrusion on the ﬁ nal concentration we have measured the DiO labeled lipid concentration through their in - tensities before and after the extrusion . We found that the lipid concen - tration does not change during the extrusion . PIP 2 micelles were prepared by suspending 1 mg of PIP 2 in the re - quired buffer and sonicating for 5 min at room temperature . LUVETs were prepared from 100 % PS , or 100 % PC or the combination of 70 % PS and 30 % PC ( PS / PC ( 70 / 30 ) ) lipids . We also used PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in 4 % or 15 % together with 96 or 85 % PC liposomes ( PIP 2 / PC ( 4 / 96 ) or PIP 2 / PC ( 15 / 85 ) ) in the studies , respectively . 2 . 3 . Steady - state ﬂ uorescence experiments Steady - state Förster Type Resonance Energy Transfer ( FRET ) was measured between ﬂ uorescence - labeled IMD ( with IAEDANS on cyste - ine as donor ) and labeled LUVETs ( with DiO as acceptor ) , and its ef ﬁ - ciency was calculated , similarly as we previously described [ 26 ] . The binding characteristic was determined by using increasing concentra - tions of lipids and ﬁ xed IMD concentration . For the FRET experiments , IMD was labeled on some of its cysteines located on the surface of the molecule with the labeling ratio between 1 . 1and1 . 7 ( theprobeconcentrationvs . IMDconcentration ) . Thelabeling ratio is the ratio of the label concentration to the protein ( IMD domain ) concentration in the samples . The steady - state ﬂ uorescence measurements were performed with Horiba Jobin Yvon ( Longjumeau , France ) spectro ﬂ uorometer equipped with a thermostable cuvette holder . The experiments were carried out at 22 °C and at pH 8 . 0 in a buffer containing 2 mM Tris / HCl , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 005 % NaN 3 , 0 . 5 mM2 - mercaptoethanol and 2 mM CaCl 2 . Theex - citation wavelength for IAEDANS was 350 nm . The optical slits were set to4 nminboththeexcitationandemissionside . InFRETexperimentsthe ﬂ uorescence emission of the donor ( IAEDANS ) was recorded between 400 and 460 nm , and the area under the spectral curve was used to cal - culate the FRET parameters . The ﬂ uorescence spectra were corrected for the inner ﬁ lter effect with the absorption spectra of the same sample as previously described [ 26 ] . Fluorescence quenching experiments were carried out with IAEDANS – IMD whichwastitratedwithaneutralquencher ( acrylamide ) . The concentration of the quencher was increased from 0 to 0 . 42 M in the solution . 2 . 4 . Calculations The ef ﬁ ciency of FRET ( E ) can be determined from the donor inten - sities by using the following equation : E ¼ 1 – F DA = F D ð Þ ð 1 Þ where F DA and F D are the ﬂ uorescence intensities of the donor in the presence and absence of the acceptor , respectively . The ef ﬁ ciency ( E ) of the ﬂ uorescence energy transfer increases with lipid bindingto IMD and its value is proportional to theconcentration of the formed complexes . We have used a quadratic equation to ﬁ t the binding data and determine the value of K d [ 27 ] . PL ½ (cid:2) = P ½ (cid:2) ¼ P ½ (cid:2) þ L ½ (cid:2) þ K d ð Þ – P ½ (cid:2) þ L ½ (cid:2) þ K d ð Þ 2 – 4 (cid:3) P ½ (cid:2) (cid:3) L ½ (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3) ˆ 0 : 5 (cid:1) (cid:3) = 2 (cid:3) P ½ (cid:2) ð Þ ð 2 Þ where [ L ] is the total concentration of the lipids , which is varied in the experiments . [ PL ] is the concentration of the IMD bound to the lipids and [ P ] is the total concentration of IMD . The ratio of these two param - eters , [ PL ] / [ P ] , measures thefractionofIMDdomainboundtolipids [ 27 ] . In our experiments we added various concentrationsof lipidsto IMD and measured the FRET ef ﬁ ciency ( E ) . Fitting Eq . ( 2 ) to the E / E max ratios was used to determine the value of K d . The IMD can only bind to the outer lea ﬂ et of the lipid bilayer in form of LUVETs , it is possible that about the half of the lipids would be accessible for the IMD to bind to . However for the calculation of K d we used the total lipid concentration . We analyzed the data collected in steady - state quenching measure - ments by using the classical Stern – Volmer equation [ 28 ] : F 0 = F ¼ 1 þ K SV (cid:3) Q ½ (cid:2) ð 3 Þ where F 0 is the ﬂ uorescence intensity of the sample in the absence of the quencher molecule whereas F is the ﬂ uorescence intensity at differ - ent quencher concentrations [ Q ] . K SV values were determined here by 1652 K . Futó et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1831 ( 2013 ) 1651 – 1655 constructing the plots of F 0 / F vs .

Lipid binding by IMD Previously we have expressed and puri ﬁ ed the IMD and labeled it with IAEDANS ﬂ uorescent probe on its surface cysteines [ 19 ] . In the present work LUVETs were prepared from different lipid constructs and labeled with DiO ﬂ uorescence dye that penetrates into the lipid bilayer . IAEDANS - labeled IMD and DiO - labeled LUVETs were used in in vitro FRET assays to study their binding interactions . IAEDANS served as donor and DiO as acceptor . Samples of IMD and lipids in various composition and concentration were prepared and incubated to reach equilibrium , and then the intensity of the IAEDANS was measured . The ef ﬁ ciency of the FRET was calculated from these measured intensi - ties ( Eq . ( 1 ) ) and plotted as the function of the lipid concentration . In these measurements we studied the interactions between IMD and PC , PS / PC ( 70 / 30 ) , PS , PIP 2 / PC ( 4 / 96 ) or PIP 2 / PC ( 15 / 85 ) containing LUVETs ( Fig . 1A , B ) . FRET ef ﬁ ciency increases with increasing LUVET concentrations indicating that more and more donors had acceptors in their close vicinity . As LUVETs in solution are too far apart to produce ef ﬁ cient FRET , the increase of the FRET ef ﬁ ciency must have been due to the formation of binding complexes between LUVETs and IMD . The lipid concentration dependence of the FRET ef ﬁ ciency was analyzed by ﬁ ttingEq . ( 2 ) tothedata . Duringthe ﬁ ttingthevalueof theIMDconcen - tration ( 1 μ M was in the samples ) and maximal FRET ef ﬁ ciency was kept constant , the value of the equilibrium dissociation constant ( K d ) was determined . The value of E max used for the best ﬁ ts were achieved by minimizing the value of χ 2 . TheFRET ef ﬁ ciency at200 μ M lipid concentration was0 . 33 , 0 . 24and 0 . 15 in case of the PS , PS / PC ( 70 / 30 ) or PC liposomes ( Fig . 1A ) , respec - tively . The IAEDANS – IMD andPIP 2 / PC ( 4 / 96 ) or PIP 2 / PC ( 15 / 85 ) LUVETs showthehighest , 0 . 38and0 . 52FRETef ﬁ ciencyat200 μ Mconcentration ( Fig . 1B ) , respectively . The value of the FRET ef ﬁ ciency depends on several factors , including the distance between the donor and acceptor and also the relative orientation of the two ﬂ uorophores . Therefore , the variation we observed suggests that the geometrical con ﬁ guration of the IMD and the bound lipid depended on the composition of the LUVETs . The determined equilibrium dissociation constants ( K d ) are shown in Table 1 . The dissociation constant was found to be the tightest and similar for binding of IMD to PS ( K d = 78 . 86 ± 13 . 19 μ M ) or to PIP 2 containing LUVETs ( K d = 87 . 23 ± 20 . 07 μ M for PIP 2 / PC ( 15 / 85 ) and K d = 99 . 35 ± 71 . 98 μ M for PIP 2 / PC ( 15 / 85 ) ) . IMD also bound to the PS / PC ( 70 / 30 ) or to PC - LUVETs with weaker af ﬁ nities ( K d = 146 . 38 ± 50 . 03 μ M and K d = 168 . 87 ± 141 . 16 μ M , respectively ) . In the presence of the non - charged PC lipids the binding af ﬁ nity decreases indicating that the IMD preferably binds to the negatively charge lipids . The shape ofitsbindingcurveslightlydiffersfromthequadratictendency , indicating that the mechanism of IMD binding to PC lipids might be cooperative ( Fig . 1 ) . 3 . 2 . IMD binds to surface of micelles We have tested whether the IMD disrupts the micellar structure when it binds to lipids . In previous studies it was shown that TNS ﬂ uo - rescence is sensitive to thedisorder of thealiphatic core of lipid micelles or vesicles [ 29 , 30 ] . In these experiments IMD was mixed with micelles made from PIP 2 / PC ( 4 / 96 ) lipids labeled with TNS ﬂ uorescent dye . MgCl 2 canaggregatethemicellesintolargemultilamellarstructures [ 30 ] causing the TNS ﬂ uorescence to increase by 3 - fold . We found that IMD bound to the micelles , but had minimal effect on the ﬂ uorescence of the TNS - labeled micelles ( Fig . 2 ) . This observation showed that IMD could bind to the head groups of the PIP 2 or PC lipids rather than pene - trating into the core of the micelle and affecting the environment of the TNS ﬂ uorophore . Although IMD did not increase TNS ﬂ uorescence , we cannot exclude completely the possibility of slight penetration into the hydrophobic regions of the membrane bilayers . 3 . 3 . IMD prefers to bind to the negatively charged phospholipids Steady - state ﬂ uorescence quenching experiments were carried out withIAEDANS – IMDaloneorinthepresenceofLUVETsofdifferentcom - position ( Fig . 3 ) . At the starting time , IMD and 200 μ M lipid as LUVETs was added to the sample . The intensity of the IAEDANS was measured at various quencher concentrations and the Stern – Volmer plots were constructed using the experimental data . The slope of these plots ( Eq . ( 3 ) ) provided the Stern – Volmer quenching constants ( K SV ) . The quenching results are shown in Table 2 . The Stern – Volmer constant is theproductofthebimolecular quenchingconstantandthe ﬂ uorescence lifetime . Therefore , in order to determine the bimolecular quenching constants ( k + ) , we measured the lifetime of the IAEDANS in presence Fig . 1 . FRET experiments between IMD and the different LUVETs . FRET ef ﬁ ciency was measured between constant IAEDANS – IMD ( 1 μ M ) and increasing concentration of DiO - labeled LUVETs made from different lipid components as the following : A ) PC ( black triangle ) , PS / PC ( 70 / 30 ) ( black square ) , PS ( black circle ) PC ( black triangle ) , PIP 2 / PC ( 4 / 96 ) ( empty square ) and PIP 2 / PC ( 15 / 85 ) ( empty circle ) . Binding curves were ﬁ tted with Eq . ( 2 ) and K d values were calculated ( Table 1 ) . Values represent the mean ± SEM from three independent experiments . Table 1 Dissociation binding constants were calculated between IMD and different LUVETs . The values were calculated from the binding curves ﬁ tted on the FRET ef ﬁ ciency values ( see Methods ) using the result of the experiments shown in Fig . 1 .

Futó et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1831 ( 2013 ) 1651 – 1655 or absence of the LUVETs . The lifetime for a K4E – IMD — with four key lysines changed to aspartic acid [ 19 ] . — was 8 . 2 ± 0 . 3 and 16 . 4 ± 0 . 8 ns which did not change during its binding to the LUVETs . We were unable to produce enough recombinant protein to measure the lifetime of the IMD . Assuming that the lifetime of the IAEDANS – IMD does not change ( i . e . it is similar to what we observed with the K4E – IMD ) in this description we only present the Stern – Volmer constant ( K SV ) values . The K SV value wasthegreatestin the absence of LUVETs ( 8 . 23 M − 1 ) , while the quenching ef ﬁ ciency was reduced in the presence of the dif - ferent LUVETs ( PS : 3 . 73 M − 1 or PC : 6 . 13 M − 1 ) . The IAEDANS – IMD binds to the LUVETs , making the quenching less effective in both cases . The more negatively charged PS - LUVETs bind more tightly to the IMD than the non - charged PC - LUVETs , providing a lower value of static quenching constant . We also tested the K4E – IMD ( the four lysine - lacking mutant IMD ) , which showed K SV of 8 . 82 M − 1 . This result is fairly similar to the results obtained in the absence of LUVETs and indi - cates very weak or negligible interactions between the K4E – IMD and PC - LUVETs . 3 . 4 . Actin interferes with IMD – lipid interaction We set up FRET experiments to study the effect of F - or G - actin on IMD – lipid interaction . Prior to the experiment , we incubated 1 μ M IMD with 200 μ M PS - LUVETs resulting in approximately 0 . 35 transfer ef ﬁ ciency ( Fig . 4 ) . Then increasing concentrations of G - actin or phalloidin stabilized F - actin were added to the samples and the change of the transfer ef ﬁ ciency was followed ( Fig . 4 ) . The transfer ef ﬁ ciency decreased to 0 . 28 in the presence of 10 μ M G - actin , probably re ﬂ ecting a decrease in the concentration of IMD – lipid complexes . Inthe presence of F - actin , the transfer ef ﬁ ciency increased up to 0 . 48 , indicating that further IMD – lipid complexes were formed in the presence of actin ﬁ la - ments . This observation suggests that actin monomers and ﬁ laments have opposite effects on the formation of IMD binding to lipids . The un - derstanding of the mechanisms by which actin can in ﬂ uence the IMD – lipid interactions will require further investigations . 4 . Conclusions Earlier studies provided evidence that the IMD interacts with lipid membranes . IMD was shown to bind to negatively charged phospho - lipids , preferably binding to the PIP 2 containing vesicles and driving ﬁ nger - likeinvaginationsinvitro [ 20 ] . However , differentstudiesinterpret the function of the IMD differently and importantly , precise measure - ments of dissociation binding constants between the IMD and mem - branes have not yet been made . We have used a FRET method to follow the binding properties of IMD to negatively charged ( PS or PIP 2 ) or non - charged ( PC ) lipid containing vesicles . We found that the dissociation equilibrium constants ( K d ) for the IMD binding to lipids fell into the 78 . 86 – 99 . 35 μ M range for the pure PS containingLUVETsor inpresence of the PIP 2 ( 4 % or 15 % ) besides non - charged ( PC ) lipids . When non - charged PC lipids were presented in the LUVETs the binding af ﬁ nity was weaker . In the presence of PC ( 85 or 96 % ) in the PIP 2 LUVETs the IMD ' s binding af ﬁ nity decreased slightly . The dissociation constant for the IMD increased by about two - fold when 30 % PC was present in the lipid bilayer beside PS lipids . The weakest binding interaction was found between IMD and PC lipids . The FRET ef ﬁ ciency varies between 0 . 15 and 0 . 52 for the different lipid constructs at 200 μ M lipid concentration . LUVETs containing 15 % PIP 2 show the highest FRET ef ﬁ ciency , followed by those containing 4 % PIP 2 and 100 % PS . However the FRET ef ﬁ ciency does not directly in - dicate the strength of the binding and the calculated K d values were similar in these three cases . Fluorescence quenching assays showed Fig . 2 .

The effect of ﬁ lamentous or monomeric actin on IMD – lipid interaction . FRET ef ﬁ - ciency was measured between IMD and PS - LUVETs using increasing concentration of F - actin ( black square ) or G - actin ( empty square ) in the sample . At the starting time , 1 μ M IMD and 200 μ M concentration of LUVETs was added to the sample . Values repre - sent the mean ± SEM from three independent experiments . 1654 K . Futó et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1831 ( 2013 ) 1651 – 1655 that the accessibility of the ﬂ uorescence labeled IMD by the quencher molecules is also reduced with increased number of negative charges re ﬂ ecting stronger binding complexes between the IMD and the lipids . The TNS ﬂ uorescence assay revealed that the IMD does not penetrate into the core of the PIP 2 containing micelles . Considering that PS is a lot more abundant in the plasma membrane than PIP 2 , we think that the binding is not necessarily speci ﬁ c to PIP 2 . We speculate that the IMD may interact more strongly with PIP 2 only when it forms clusters in the membrane and even then the interaction is likely to be stabilized by the surrounding less negatively charged or neutral phospholipids . Actin interferes with or enhances the IMD – lipid binding , depending on its polymerization state . G - actin partially disrupts the binding while the F - actin can further stabilize IMD – lipid interaction . We speculate thatG - actinmightdissociateIMDfromthemembrane , forexampledur - ing retraction of a ﬁ lopodium or other type of protrusion . Further stud - ies will be necessary with globular or ﬁ lamentous actin and other lipid constructs to elucidate themolecularmechanisms underlying theinter - action of actin with IMD – lipid complexes .
