Although reopening K - 12 schools for in - person schooling is desirable for many reasons , oﬃcials also understand that risk reduction strategies and detection of cases must be in place to allow children to safely return to school . Furthermore , the consequences of reclosing recently reopened schools are substantial and impact teachers , parents , and ultimately the educational experience in children . Using a stratiﬁed Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Removed model , we explore the inﬂuences of reduced class density , transmission mitigation ( such as the use of masks , desk shields , frequent surface cleaning , or outdoor instruction ) , and viral detection on cumulative prevalence . Our model predicts that a combination of all three approaches will substantially reduce SARS - CoV - 2 prevalence . The model also shows that reduction of class density and the implementation of rapid viral testing , even with imperfect detection , have greater impact than moderate measures for transmission mitigation . Introduction The best way to reopen K - 12 schools has justiﬁably been a topic of intense discussion among government oﬃcials , the media , teachers and parents . Given transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 occurs through respiratory droplets , any reopening policy must adequately reduce crowded environments at school to protect children , teachers , staﬀ , and ultimately communities . Unfortunately , many factors work to the detriment of ostensibly reasonable strategies . For example , splitting a school day into morning and afternoon blocks may extend teachers’ working hours or fail to adequately reduce class density in already overcrowded school districts . Primary caretakers who work outside the home face additional challenges in dropping oﬀ and picking up children from school . Finally , there is the issue of the quality of educational experiences to consider . A recent study on the eﬀects of school closure in March in the U . S . suggests that it reduced COVID - 19 cases in states with low cumulative incidence [ 2 ] , yet education researchers worry that teachers will face lagging educational development of children once schools reopen due to the extended period of remote learning [ 11 ] .

Having to close schools that have reopened due to an unacceptable risk in COVID - 19 cases is a serious concern and has prompted the inclusion of stopping rules in guidelines for school reopening [ 31 ] . As school systems have proposed diﬀerent scenarios of reopening to reduce the density of students and the number of student interactions , it is helpful to investigate quantitatively the ramiﬁcations of the proposed plans . Here we explore a simple and interpretable mathematical model that compares the infection rates in children and adults under various reopening scenarios . Our approach stratiﬁes members of a school community into two age groups , school - age children and adults , and assigns children to a single or two or three diﬀerent cohorts . The two age groups diﬀer in size , but within each group all children or all adults exhibit homogeneous disease behavior . With multiple cohorts , the goal is to limit the density of children in the classroom at a given time . Speciﬁcally , we compare the consequences of ( 1 ) reopening at full capacity , ( 2 ) allowing half of all children to return to in - person schooling while the other half continues with remote learning ( parallel cohorts ) and ( 3 ) alternating sessions in which diﬀerent cohorts of students attend school by the week ( rotating cohorts ) . The latter scenario is designed to reduce classroom density and contacts between children while providing some of the beneﬁts of in - person learning to all children . Our goal is to provide insight into the epidemiological implications of these reopening strategies and to quantify their consequences . In particular , we explore implications of the recent guidelines announced by Governor Gavin Newsom for California schools [ 31 ] . We ﬁnd that reopening schools at half capacity , by running either two parallel cohorts of in - person and remote learning or two rotating cohorts of in - person learning , is likely to have a greater impact in controlling virus spread than direct measures that mitigate transmission risk . That is , reducing the number or density of contacts produces a larger eﬀect than diminishing the transmis - sion rate per contact . Our models also suggest that the regular administration of rapid surveillance tests , even with imperfect sensitivity , can signiﬁcantly delay disease outbreaks . It is our hope that our results along with further data and modeling by other experts will guide public health policy decisions . Methods Compartmental model . Our approach uses a deterministic Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Removed ( SEIR ) model stratiﬁed by age group and cohort . In full generality , let S ( t ) , E ( t ) , I ( t ) , and R ( t ) denote the fraction of susceptible , exposed , infected , and removed individuals , respectively , in the overall population at time t . Infecteds may or may not present with symptoms . The removed pool accounts for individuals with negligible contribution to the spread of infection , including individ - uals that have either recovered with full immunity or are no longer part of the population due to disabling morbidity or death . Although prospects that infection leads to permanent immunity are unclear , immunity on the time scale of several months or more is plausible [ 20 ] , so we make the assumption that individuals do not return to the susceptible pool once they are infected . Denote by I il ( t ) the fraction of infecteds in age group i and cohort l . We propose the following frequency - dependent model for the force of infection on individuals in age group j and cohort k : force of infection =   interaction between cohorts k , (cid:96)   ×   transmission between age groups i → j   ×    fraction of infecteds in age group i , and cohort (cid:96)    λ jk ( t ) = (cid:88) (cid:96) (cid:88) i α k(cid:96) × β ij ( t ) × I i(cid:96) ( t ) 2 .

Values in between these limits may be interpreted as decreased interaction due to physical or social distancing . We allow for weak cohort interaction ( α k(cid:96) = 0 . 05 , k (cid:54) = (cid:96) ) in all our simulations . To capture the variability in exposure to infectious individuals across age groups and diﬀerent cohorts , the transmission rate β ij ( t ) is time - inhomogeneous . These choices eﬀectively model the density dependence of coronavirus transmission on cohort isolation and contact patterns between diﬀerent age groups . We model two age groups , children and adults , and ignore vital dynamics ( that is , ordinary births and deaths ) altogether . The latter choice is justiﬁed by the relatively short time period over which the model acts . The resulting ordinary diﬀerential equation ( ODE ) subsystem describing cohort k is given by d S 1 k d t = − λ 1 k S 1 k d E 1 k d t = λ 1 k S 1 k − σ 1 E 1 k d I 1 k d t = σ 1 E 1 k − γ 1 I 1 k d R 1 k d t = γ 1 I 1 k d S 2 k d t = − λ 2 k S 2 k d E 2 k d t = λ 2 k S 2 k − σ 2 E 2 k d I 2 k d t = σ 2 E 2 k − γ 2 I 2 k d R 2 k d t = γ 2 I 2 k , with the left and right columns corresponding to children and adults , respectively . For simplicity in communicating the key ideas in our model , we limit the scope of simulations to two age groups , children in K - 12 education and individuals over the age of 18 , and to 1 to 3 child cohorts . We also neglect any inhomogeneity in susceptibility and transmission within each of the two age groups [ 4 , 9 ] . To our credit , we emphasize the interplay of transmission across and within age classes , that is the ratios β ii / β jj and β ij / β ji . By design , our model makes it easy to explicitly incorporate susceptibility , contact patterns , and , ultimately , ﬁner age stratiﬁcation . In broad outline , our model is similar to that of Zhang et al . [ 26 ] . However , these researchers emphasize diﬀerences in contact patterns across age groups rather than school reopening policies . Cohort structure and transmission rates . Previous work suggests that a cyclic attendance strategy tuned to the latent period of SARS - CoV - 2 may curtail secondary infections [ 10 ] . To compare with full - time and online - only instruction , we investigate the consequences of reopening at 50 % and 33 % capacity with rotating cohorts . Assuming a latent period within the range of 3 – 4 days , a weekly rotation schedule synchronizes with peak infectiousness . Our simulations therefore model transmission between children using periodic rates that cycle between high and low contact values . Namely , we take β 11 ( t ) = c × β on school days and β 11 ( t ) = β otherwise , where β is a baseline rate outside of school and c is a multiplier increasing transmission between children . This function is phased between cohorts to reﬂect school rotation . In summary , children in rotating cohorts attend school for 5 consecutive days and then rotate with the next cohort at the beginning of the following week . With two cohorts children attend school every other week ; for three cohorts they attend every third week . As noted previously , this is referred to as the rotating cohort strategy . An emerging national trend in the U . S . is to allow families to opt for remote learning in lieu of in - person instruction during the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . Speciﬁcally , we divide our virtual school community into two cohorts of equal size , one of which attends school and thus has the elevated transmission rate while a second group opts for a remote learning option . This is referred to as the parallel cohort strategy . 3 .

As of August 3 , 2020 , the CDC reports 4 . 6 million COVID - 19 cases in the United States [ 32 ] . California , Florida , and Texas are each burdened with nearly 0 . 5 million cases , which corresponds to 1 % infection in their respective populations . Given that the U . S . has considerable variation in density , we seed all our simulations , which represent school communities rather than states , with 0 . 1 % infected individuals . Increasing this value accelerates infections in our model ; decreasing it lessens the spread . Our simulations therefore represent scenarios far from herd immunity [ 12 , 21 ] . Although children have fewer symptoms , less severe disease , and lower case - fatality rates than adults , they may be just as prone to SARS - CoV - 2 infections as adults [ 28 ] . Children may present with a variety of symptoms ranging from fever , rhinitis , cough , and GI symptoms , to a Kawasaki - like disease [ 22 ] . However , because children’s symptoms are typically less severe and of shorter duration than those of adults , the likelihood of pediatric infection escaping symptom - based mon - itoring , such as temperature screening , is therefore is higher than that of adults and increases asymptomatic transmission . Thus , detecting transmission between children speciﬁcally is diﬃcult ; quantifying it is all the more challenging . An analysis of contact tracing data from Singapore sug - gests that per contact transmission between children , particularly in educational settings , is low compared to adult - adult transmission [ 24 ] . Yet the number of contacts between children is ex - pected to be signiﬁcantly higher compared to other age groups [ 26 ] . Li et al . provide estimates for transmission rates in Wuhan prior to ( 1 . 12 per day ) and following travel restrictions ( 0 . 52 per day ) [ 16 ] . Reconciling estimates of transmission rates across populations , which are necessarily based on diﬀerent scientiﬁc models , is unproductive in proposing policy . Instead , we vary each β ij in simulations to underscore the inﬂuence of modeling assumptions on epidemiological consequences . In later simulations we opt to model child - to - child transmission with lower rates to reﬂect evidence suggesting children are rarely index cases [ 15 ] and have fewer contacts outside of school . In this setting , transmission is elevated by a factor c in children only on school days , β 11 ( t ) = c × β , so as to account for increased contacts . A recent study indicates that viral RNA in the nasopharynx of young children is elevated compared to adults [ 8 ] , partially justifying this modeling choice . In contrast to contact rates , the latent , infectious , and incubation periods for SARS - CoV - 2 are well characterized in the literature . Lauer et al . estimate a median incubation period of ap - proximately 5 days [ 14 ] . Li et al . [ 16 ] infer latency and infectious periods of 3 . 69 and 3 . 47 days , respectively , in a study aimed at characterizing contributions of undocumented infections to disease spread in China . The review by Bar - On draws from these studies and reports median latent and infectious periods of 3 and 4 days , respectively [ 3 ] . Other studies report serial intervals and incu - bation periods consistent with these estimates for latency and infectiousness [ 6 , 7 ] . Unfortunately , the literature on similar epidemiological inferences in children is sparse . Table 1 summarizes our choices and lists references pertinent to each choice . Basic reproductive number . We now characterize the basic reproductive number R 0 indicative of the growth potential of an epidemic . Speciﬁcally , R 0 quantiﬁes the expected number of secondary infections due to a single infected within a completely susceptible population . The threshold R 0 value of 1 marks the boundary between explosive growth ( R 0 > 1 ) and decline of an epidemic to extinction ( R 0 < 1 ) . We characterize R 0 using the next generation method as outlined by Diekmann , Heesterbeek , and Roberts [ 5 ] . Under the assumption that viral infections have been suﬃciently contained in the community prior to reopening , it is reasonable to linearize dynamics by taking S ( 0 ) ≈ 1 . Thus , the transmission and transition operators T and Σ are given respectively 4 .

Together , these linear operators deﬁne an embedded subsystem that completely characterizes infectious dynamics , namely d x d t = ( T + Σ ) x . The standard theory identiﬁes R 0 as the spectral radius of − T Σ − 1 , a quantity that can be computed numerically in practice . In the case of multiple cohorts , the structures of T and Σ as given are repeated in a tiled fashion , with the appropriate changes in indices for α k(cid:96) and S j(cid:96) . Results Eﬀect of reducing density via cohorts . Transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 is thought to occur primarily through respiratory droplets . Thus , it is critical to ﬁrst examine the eﬀect of separating children into several rotating cohorts in our model , which implicitly reduces density via the contact network of a population . Figure 1 summarizes the inﬂuence of time - homogeneous transmission rates β ij ( t ) = β ij on the reproductive number R 0 under various scenarios , assuming a population mix of 55 % children and 45 % adults and strong adherence to mitigation policies ( with α k(cid:96) = 0 . 05 for each k (cid:54) = (cid:96) ) that keep both children and adults isolated from members of other cohorts . Splitting a school community into even 2 or 3 rotating cohorts substantially reduces R 0 under a wide range of parameter values and slows viral spread in cases of moderate transmissibility . For example , moving from full capacity to 2 cohorts reduces R 0 by 50 % for the range 0 ≤ β 11 , β 22 ≤ 1 ( Figure 1 , A and 1B ) . Using three cohorts further reduces R 0 for comparable β 11 and β 22 ( Figure 1C ) . This parameter range is of interest because it corresponds to R 0 ≈ 2 in the full capacity scenario . Likewise , two or three rotating cohorts for children also decrease R 0 when transmission rates between children and adults are asymmetric ; that is , β 12 > β 21 or β 12 < β 21 ( Figure 1 , D to F ) . As demonstrated by the skew present in our contour plots , age structure ampliﬁes the inﬂuence of transmission rates . Reopening under stopping rules . We now consider the eﬀect of a stopping rule on cumulative prevalence . Inspired by California’s recent guidelines that urge schools to close down whenever the percent of infecteds within a school reaches 5 % over a 2 week period [ 31 ] , we use a cumulative prevalence of 5 % as a stopping rule . In symbols , the stopping rule is given by the condition sensitivity × (cid:88) k [ I 1 , k ( t ) + R 1 , k ( t ) ] ≥ 5 % , which relies on the detection of cases on school days as well as on surveillance reports from outside of school . Detection is based on testing at the beginning of a school day , after which infected individuals in the active cohort are immediately isolated and placed in the removed state ( I ( t ) → R ( t ) ) . The isolation rule does not apply to the out of school cohort or cohorts . The sensitivity factor in the rule captures imprecision in testing and reporting . Because our model does not explicitly account for adult staﬀ at school , we measure only the cumulative prevalence within the child population . This choice is partially justiﬁed because students typically well outnumber teachers and ancillary staﬀ . Under the assumption of a 20 : 1 student - staﬀ ratio , a school with 1000 students would need approximately 53 cases in a 14 - day period to meet the closure criterion . Please note 5 .

Figure 2 reports the number of weeks to reach the 5 % threshold in our model in various pa - rameter regimes , assuming the monitoring program exactly identiﬁes infections in children as they begin a new day of school . Cohort separation tends to dramatically reduce the spread of infection . Owing to high child - to - child transmission eﬀects within school ( c = 10 ) , our model predicts closures within a month in a full - capacity high transmission scenario with no mitigation ( Figure 2 , A and E ) . Under the more optimistic assumption of preventive measures , hitting the 5 % threshold may take several weeks and may , in fact , never occur in the ideal circumstances of low density and eﬀective risk mitigation ( Figure 2 , B to D and F to H ) . Notably , under most of the parameter values we chose , 2 parallel cohorts and 2 rotating cohorts show similar time to 5 % infecteds , with the parallel cohort strategy having a slight advantage when β 11 and β 22 are large . For example when β 11 = 1 and β 22 = 1 , 2 rotating cohorts reach the 5 % infected level in 6 to 8 weeks , and 2 parallel cohorts reach it in 8 to 10 weeks ( Figure 2 , B and C ) . This behavior is partially driven by the testing protocol , which only detects and isolates cases in the active cohort . Unfortunately , the issue of detection is complicated by the availability of testing resources , administration of tests , and speciﬁcity of the tests used . In light of this reality , we compare predictions of our model over 6 months when ( 1 ) no action is taken ( Figure 3 , A and B ) , ( 2 ) the monitoring program uses a perfectly sensitive test with no delays in reporting ( Figure 3 , C and D ) , and ( 3 ) the monitoring program uses a rapid but less sensitive test ( Figure 3 , E and F ) . Our simulations with a single cohort indicate that a 5 % percent threshold policy can shift infections in children from 80 % to 55 % over a 6 month period when child - to - child transmission rates in school are high ( Figure 3C ) . Compared to this ideal testing scenario , an imperfect test with 50 % detection leads to an earlier stopping time , owing to infections spread by undetected cases , and to greater pediatric infections but still far less than the no testing scenario ( Figure 3E ) . Let us emphasize our ﬁnding that reopening with a surveillance program in place may provide 10 to 12 weeks of continuous instruction with low infection risk . Infections after closing are driven by a lack of interventions outside of school ; testing and isolation in this context can curtail this growth . In general , our results support the importance of testing and the failsafe of complete school closure in preventing a major disease outbreak after reopening . Next , we explore the ramiﬁcations of two parallel cohorts using the simulation study design just considered . Speciﬁcally , we assume the elevated transmission rate β 11 ( t ) = c × 0 . 15 during a regular 5 - day school week and and the reduced transmission rate β 11 ( t ) = 0 . 15 during the oﬀ week . The remaining transmission rates are chosen with R 0 > 1 to capture outbreak conditions . These choices lead to more rapid acting infection and earlier school closure than those chosen in Figure 3 under the single cohort policy . Figure 4 reports the same indices recorded in our simulation study with the single cohort policy . As our earlier ﬁgures illustrate , reducing density through the community’s contact network successfully decreases cumulative prevalences , sustained contact between children notwithstanding ( Figure 4 , A to D ) . The in - person stopping rule ( the entire school goes online when cumulative prevalence reaches 5 % ) is triggered even when detection is imperfect ( Figure 4 , E to F ) . Because cohorts reduce contacts , our model predicts a longer period of instruction ( 18 - 22 weeks ) with the parallel strategy ( Figure 4 , C and E ) compared to the previous simulation with all students attending at once ( 10 - 12 weeks ) ( Figure 3 , C and E ) . We note that , despite the remote cohort child - to - child transmission rate being 1 / 10 of the in - person cohort child - to - child rate , the remote cohort has more infections than the in - person cohort in both surveillance scenarios . This result occurs because only the latter cohort is monitored through the school’s testing program . One may interpret this as an upper bound on infections for the remote learning cohort as there will likely be some monitoring for this group in practice . 6 .

Transmission mitigation strategies that may work well for adults may be less practical to implement with children . As an example , although face masks have been shown to reduce the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 by 40 % [ 17 ] , there are valid concerns about the ill eﬀects of mask wearing by elementary school children . These concerns include im - paired learning , speech development , social development , and facial recognition [ 29 ] . There is also doubt about whether young children can properly keep their masks on . The protection gained from mask wearing needs to be weighed against the disadvantages just enumerated . Regardless of their form , we assume that eﬀective strategies will be employed . Using reasonable approximations for contact and transmission risks , we explore the impacts of varying degrees of protection conferred by combined risk reduction strategies , including but not limited to mask wearing , desk shields , hand washing , vigilant cleaning of surfaces , improved ventilation , and outdoor instruction . The combined impacts of these risk reduction strategies are modeled as 20 % , 40 % , 60 % , and 80 % reduc - tions in the transmission rates β 11 and β 12 relative to reference values . We particularly examine the changes in infection levels under each scenario , taking care in selecting the adult values β 21 and β 22 to account for simultaneous risk reduction strategies among adults . Speciﬁcally , we take β 11 = 0 . 1 and β 12 = β 21 = β 22 = 0 . 5 as natural rates . Under a baseline model reducing transmission rates in adults to β 21 = β 22 = 0 . 2 , we achieve an R 0 ≈ 1 . 8 when schools remain closed . We choose to model increased contact rates β 11 ( t ) = c × 0 . 1 by taking c = 10 , which corresponds to R 0 ≈ 3 . 3 under the full capacity reopening scenario . This necessarily represents an extreme that illustrate eﬀects in a poor situation . Figure 5 compares prevalence trajectories by interventions directly targeting transmission under a single or two rotating child cohorts . With a single cohort and no mitigation , our choices lead to approximately 2 % , 46 % , and 65 % infected children after 1 , 3 , and 6 months following reopening , respectively ( Figure 5A ) . However , with measures that lead to an 80 % reduction in transmission , it would take more than 24 weeks to reach a cumulative prevalence of 5 % in children ( Figure 5A ) . Achieving an 80 % reduction in transmission would be diﬃcult in practice . With a more realistic reduction factor of only 20 % , our model predicts that 5 % cumulative prevalence in children would be reached in roughly 8 weeks ( Figure 5A ) . Targeting transmission rates in children also reduces infections in adults to a similar degree ( Figure 5B ) . Although policies such as mask use and hand washing have an appreciable eﬀect in reducing infections , our model predicts the intuitive conclusion that stricter adherence to transmission mitigation measures is required to lead to low levels of infection when there is a single cohort than when there are two cohorts . In fact , we show that an 80 % reduction in child - to - child transmission is required to lead to 0 . 5 % pediatric infections over 6 months , which is roughly equivalent to the eﬀect of 2 rotating cohorts ( Figure 5C , D ) without mitigation strategies . A combination of both types of interventions ultimately results in even fewer infections . Discussion Our models highlight the profound potential impact of reducing cohort size with parallel or rotating cohorts under a range of transmission rates and reproduction numbers . For example , if we take transmission rates β 11 = β 22 = 1 , it would take approximately 2 weeks to reach a threshold of 5 % children infected , whereas under the same transmission rates splitting the school population into two or three rotating cohorts would lead to a month or more of uninterrupted instruction ( Figure 2 ) . Quite apart from cohort strategies , our work also reveals the importance of tracking infections and setting a threshold for reverting to remote learning . In the absence of any intervention to in - person instruction , the cumulative proportion of the school children population can quickly reach 20 % within 6 weeks ( Figure 3A ) . This compares with keeping that cumulative proportion at 5 − 10 % 7 .

Finally , our results demonstrate that simultaneous adherence to transmission mitigation measures and multiple separated cohorts can keep cases low , for example under 0 . 5 % ( Figure 5C , D ) . There are several limitations to our simulations . First , we account only for two separate age classes , children and adults . A ﬁner level of age stratiﬁcation may be better suited for predicting outcomes in speciﬁc communities and is , in principle , straightforward to implement within our modeling framework . For example , our model currently makes no distinction between high school and elementary school children . High school students may be more easily convinced into wearing masks reliably and practicing physical distancing , but they also may have transmission rates closer to those of adults . Second , we treat all adults , including teachers , as having the same transmission rates and omit interactions between students and teachers within a classroom . The latter are clearly critical in implementing backup protocols that allow the switch to remote learning . A network - based model that accounts for households and classrooms in more detail would be better equipped to identify optimal policies . Third , our model treats school communities in isolation . Schools in urban settings undoubtedly have more diverse commuting patterns and face a greater potential for importing cases from outside adjacent neighborhoods . Finally , our models are deterministic and cannot account for the stochastic nature of infections . The caveats outlined here limit the quantitative accuracy of our predictions , but we contend that our qualitative conclusions are correct . As already mentioned , our simulations suggest that measures that reduce class density by rotating cohorts between in - person and online schooling are likely to have the greatest impact in reducing the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 brought on by the resumption of in - person instruction . From the perspective of mathematical epidemiology , this is to be expected as separating a contact graph into disconnected pieces ultimately limits the proliferative potential of an infectious disease . Parallel cohorts present an attractive alternative to rotating cohorts because the latter require a great deal of coordination and place a burden on parents to adjust their work schedules to match their children’s in - class and at home schedules . Although less than ideal from an educational perspective , educating children under either cohort strategy should be a priority in school reopenings . Even so , our ﬁndings indicate that implementation of speciﬁc in - class policies such as mask wearing , hand washing , and physical distancing in the classroom will be helpful in reducing transmission rates . Our simulations of a backup plan to switch to remote learning when the number of infections climbs to an unacceptable level emphasize the need for rapid testing and eﬃcacious surveillance programs . These results are consistent with a recent study on the inﬂuence of viral kinetics , test sensitivity , test frequency , and sample - to - answer reporting time in surveillance protocols [ 13 ] . This study concludes that test eﬃcacy should be a secondary concern in implementing testing given the dangers of the current pandemic . Finally , diﬀerent communities should be treated diﬀerently . High - risk communities with large class sizes need to be especially careful in exposing children to unnecessary risks . We are happy to share our software and assist in its improvement .

The range for transmission between adults is informed by [ 16 ] . Latent and infectious period estimates are based on [ 3 , 16 ] . Figure 1 : Predicted R 0 under various density and rotating cohort scenarios . Results are based on a latent period of 3 days ( σ 1 = σ 2 = 1 / 3 ) and an infectious period of 4 days ( γ 1 = γ 2 = 1 / 4 ) . We also assume weak interaction between cohorts ( α k(cid:96) = 0 . 05 when k (cid:54) = (cid:96) ) . As the color gradient changes from purple to blue , R 0 changes from < 1 to > 1 .

We use children as representatives of the entire school subpopulation . The 5 % threshold tracks cumulative prevalence over all cohorts , (cid:80) k [ I 1 , k ( t ) + R 1 , k ( t ) ] ≥ 0 . 05 × 12 , thus accounting for the size of the schoolchildren population ( 50 % ) relative to the overall commu - nity . In each simulation , children have an elevated transmission rate due to school contacts over the rate they have when they are not in school ; for example , β 11 ( t ) = 1 = c × 0 . 1 with c = 10 . Results are based on latent and infectious periods of 3 and 4 days , respectively ( σ 1 = σ 2 = 1 / 3 , γ 1 = γ 2 = 1 / 4 ) , and the additional assumptions that ( A – D ) transmission between age classes is equal ( β 12 = β 21 = 0 . 5 ) , and ( E – H ) where adult - to - adult transmission dominates outside of school ( β 11 = 0 . 1 and β 22 = 0 . 5 ) . Deep purple is used to indicate scenarios in which the threshold is hit after 22 weeks or more . 10 .

In both scenarios , the school is assumed to operate at full capacity . Simulations are based on parameter values β 12 = β 21 = β 22 = 0 . 5 , σ 1 = σ 2 = 1 / 3 , and γ 1 = γ 2 = 1 / 4 . For child - to - child transmission , we set β 11 ( t ) = 0 . 1 outside of school and β 11 ( t ) = 1 = c × 0 . 1 during school ( c = 10 ) . Curves correspond to active infections ( blue ) , removed individuals ( orange ) , and cumulative prevalence ( green ) . The school switches to online instruction when detected cases aﬀect 5 % of the school population ( vertical line ) , dramatically reducing spread . ( E , F ) Closures occur earlier and the cumulative prevalence is larger compared to the ideal detection scenario . However , there is not an appreciable increase in long term - infections when the monitoring program has poor detection , and both monitoring scenarios have appreciably less long term infectious than the no intervention scenario . 11 .

Simulations are based on parameter values β 12 = β 21 = β 22 = 0 . 75 , σ 1 = σ 2 = 1 / 3 , and γ 1 = γ 2 = 1 / 4 and assume weak cohort interaction . For child - to - child transmission , we set β 11 ( t ) = 0 . 15 outside of school and β 11 ( t ) 1 . 5 = c × 0 . 1 during school where c = 10 . Importantly , only one cohort attends school and detection is based on this group . ( A , B ) Predicted prevalence without any intervention .

Simulations are based on parameter values β 12 = β 21 = β 22 = 0 . 2 , σ 1 = σ 2 = 1 / 3 , and γ 1 = γ 2 = 1 / 4 , assuming a population with equal numbers of children and adults . For child - child transmission , we set β 11 ( t ) = 0 . 1 outside of school and β 11 ( t ) = ( 1 − r ) × c × 0 . 1 during school , where r is a reduction factor due to eﬀective risk reduction strategies and c = 10 accounts for increased contact between children . ( A , B ) Mitigation that reduces transmission between children can lead to a substantial reduction in infections , provided the mitigation eﬀects are large . ( C , D ) The impact of risk reduction strategies persists when children are separated into 2 rotating cohorts but does not demand as strict adherence to be eﬀective . An 80 % reduction in pediatric transmission is nearly equivalent to separating children into 2 rotating cohorts as both strategies result in fewer than 0 . 5 % pediatric infections over 6 months . 13 .
