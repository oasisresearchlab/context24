Navigating Increasing Levels of Relational Complexity : Perceptual , Analogical , and System Mappings Matthew J . Kmiecik 1 , Rodolfo Perez 1 , and Daniel C . Krawczyk 1 , 2 Abstract ■ Relational thinking involves comparing abstract relationships between mental representations that vary in complexity ; however , this complexity israrely made explicit during everyday comparisons . This study explored how people naturally navigate relational complexity and interference using a novel relational match - to - sample ( RMTS ) task with both minimal and relationally directed instruction to observe changes in performance across three levels of relational complexity : perceptual , analogy , and system mappings . Individual working memory and relational abilities were examined to understand RMTS performance and susceptibility to interfering relational structures . Trials were presented without practice across four blocks , and participants received feedback after each attempt to guide learning . Experiment 1 instructed participants to select the target that best matched the sample , whereas Experiment 2 additionally directed participants ’ attention to same and different relations . Participants in Experiment 2 demonstrated improved performance when solving analogical mappings , suggesting that directing attention to relational characteristics affected behavior . Higher performing participants — those with above - chance perfor - mance on the final block of system mappings — solved more analog - ical RMTS problems and had greater visuospatial working memory , abstraction , verbal analogy , and scene analogy scores compared to lower performers . Lower performers were less dynamic in their performance across blocks and demonstrated negative relation - ships between analogy and system mapping accuracy , suggesting increased interference between these relational structures . Participant performance on RMTS problems did not change monotonically with relational complexity , suggesting that in - creases in relational complexity places nonlinear demands on working memory . We argue that competing relational information causes additional interference , especially in individuals with lower executive function abilities . ■ INTRODUCTION The foundation of human thinking and reasoning relies on relational thought . When we think relationally , we are able to understand and appreciate how mental representations relate to each other despite their featural discrepancies . For instance , consider an analogy between Ohm ’ s law and water pressure . In an electrical circuit , Ohm ’ s law ( V = IR ) states that voltage ( V ) is directly proportional to the amount of current ( I ) given a constant resistance ( R ) , there - fore implying that an increase in resistance , given a constant current , results in an increase in voltage . Similarly , the water pressure of a constant flow of water through a hose will increase if the hose becomes narrower . In this case , a rela - tional mapping of concepts ( water pressure - to - voltage ; water flow - to - current ; hose width - to - resistance ) facilitates the understanding of their relationships , despite their fea - tural differences ( e . g . , concepts like current , voltage , and resistance are impossible to see with the naked eye ) . Our ability to extract , compare , and integrate relationships enables myriad cognitive abilities ubiquitous in daily life ( Hofstadter & Sander , 2013 ; Holyoak & Thagard , 1995 ; Gentner , 1983 ) that include learning ( Vendetti , Matlen , Richland , & Bunge , 2015 ; Gentner , 2010 ; Richland , Zur , & Holyoak , 2007 ; Goswami , 1992 ) , problem solving ( Gick & Holyoak , 1980 , 1983 ) , creative thinking ( Green , Kraemer , Fugelsang , Gray , & Dunbar , 2012 ) , and discovery ( Hofstadter & Sander , 2013 ; Gentner , 2002 ) . Analogical reasoning is a specific form of relational rea - soning defined by the mapping of objects between knowl - edge structures that prioritizes relationships rather than attributes ( Gentner , 1983 ) . Object attributes and their degree of featural similarity are allowed to vary ; however , the objects and their relations must maintain a systematic structure in which the relations between objects are the same . In essence , analogies involve the comparisons of relationships — water “ flowing through ” a hose is like current “ flowing through ” a circuit . Analogies can also be compared to one another . For instance , consider again the Ohm ’ s law hydraulic analogy . There are often two different forms of this analogy offered that differ in how the water receives the energy necessary to flow through the hose either via ( 1 ) an electric water pump or ( 2 ) poten - tial energy given to a bucket of water raised on an elevated surface . Despite these analogies not differing in their in - herent relational structure , the reasoner in developing a This article is part of a Special Focus , Relational Reasoning , deriving from a symposium at the 2019 annual meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Society , organized by Silvia Bunge and Keith Holyoak . 1 The University of Texas at Dallas , 2 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center © 2020 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 33 : 3 , pp . 357 – 376 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1162 / jocn _ a _ 01618 preference for either analogy , or even merely appreciating their relational similarities , has engaged in comparing higher - order relations ( e . g . , relations of other relations ) . Therefore , relational structures between comparable repre - sentations can vary in their complexity . Understanding how humans are able to perform relational comparisons of increasing complexity has implications for ontogeny ( Halford , Wilson , & Phillips , 1998 ; Halford , 1992 ) , phylog - eny ( Premack , 2010 ; Penn , Holyoak , & Povinelli , 2008 ) , and cognitive neuroscience ( Holyoak & Kroger , 1995 ; Robin & Holyoak , 1995 ) . Patient and fMRI research across the past two decades has solidified the role of the pFC in integrating relational infor - mation of increasing complexity ( see Krawczyk , 2012 ) . Frontotemporal dementia patients with selective pFC degeneration ( frontal variant ) demonstrated pronounced deficits in integrating multiple relationships and inhibiting distracting information compared to those with selective anterior temporal damage ( Krawczyk et al . , 2008 ; Morrison et al . , 2004 ; Waltz et al . , 1999 ) . When solving nonsemantic Raven ’ s Progressive Matrices ( Raven , 1941 ) , the process of integrating increasingly complex relations in the face of dis - tracting elements selectively activated more anterior pFC regions , including the rostrolateral and dorsolateral pFC ( Kroger et al . , 2002 ; Christoff et al . , 2001 ; Prabhakaran , Smith , Desmond , Glover , & Gabrieli , 1997 ) . Voxel - based morphometry and symptom lesion mapping techniques have more specifically implicated the left rostrolateral pFC as an essential region for relational integration ( Aichelburg et al . , 2016 ; Urbanski et al . , 2016 ) with addi - tional support from both semantic ( Green , Kraemer , Fugelsang , Gray , & Dunbar , 2010 ; Bunge , Wendelken , Badre , & Wagner , 2005 ) and nonsemantic ( Volle , Gilbert , Benoit , & Burgess , 2010 ; Bunge , Helskog , & Wendelken , 2009 ) relational mappings . Inhibiting distracting or irrelevant information from entering working memory is also important for successful relational reasoning . Individuals with greater general fluid intelligence — as measured via Raven ’ s Advanced Progressive Matrices — were more successful in overcom - ing distracting lure trials during an n - back task and exhib - ited increased lateral pFC activation during interference control , suggesting relational integration and inhibitory control are closely related and rely on lateral pFC ( Gray , Chabris , & Braver , 2003 ) . However , factorially manipulat - ing relational complexity and the number of distracting elements emphasized the role of the lateral frontal pole during relational integration , whereas inhibitory control relied more on lateral pFC regions ( i . e . , middle and inferior frontal gyri ; Cho et al . , 2010 ) . Together , these results sug - gest that integrating increasingly complex relations relies on anterior regions of pFC and competes with cognitive re - sources in working memory , especially when encoded dis - tracting elements need inhibition for successful relational reasoning ( see also Cho , Holyoak , & Cannon , 2007 ) . Halford et al . ( 1998 ) argued that working memory capacity is defined not by the number of items requiring processing but rather by their relational complexity . They defined rela - tional complexity as the “ number of related dimensions or sources of variation ” ( p . 803 ) , such that unary relations have a single relational argument ( e . g . , fruit [ apple ] ) , binary rela - tions have two arguments ( e . g . , opposite [ black , white ] ) , ternary relations have three arguments ( e . g . , taller [ John , Mark , Luke ] ) , and so on . Higher - order relations and rela - tional structures are composed by nesting these first - order relations as arguments in second - order relations . For example , an analogy under this formulation is stated : same [ opposite ( black , white ) , opposite ( noisy , quiet ) ] . We borrow from Robin and Holyoak ( 1995 ) to characterize higher - order relational complex into three levels : 1 ( 1 ) Attribute / perceptual mappings contain a single dimen - sion same ( triangle , triangle ) ( 2 ) Relational / analogical mappings contain two dimensions same [ same ( triangle , triangle ) , same ( square , square ) ] ( 3 ) System mappings contain three dimensions same ( same [ same ( triangle , triangle ) , same ( square , square ) ] , same [ different ( circle , rectangle ) , different ( star , diamond ) ] ) Studies of comparative psychology have employed match - to - sample ( MTS ) tasks to probe the relational abilities of var - ious animal species . MTS tasks present a “ sample ” stimulus composed of shapes or objects , and participants / subjects are instructed or trained to select a matching “ target ” stimulus given alternative options . Identical perceptual matches ( i . e . , matching A to A and not B ) are easily performed by ver - tebrates , including pigeons ( e . g . , Blaisdell & Cook , 2005 ) , monkeys ( e . g . , baboons ; Bovet & Vauclair , 2001 ) , crows ( Smirnova , Zorina , Obozova , & Wasserman , 2015 ) , chimpan - zees ( Thompson & Oden , 2000 ; Premack , 1983 ) , humans ( Kroger , Holyoak , & Hummel , 2004 ) , and even the inverte - brate honeybee ( Giurfa , Zhang , Jenett , Menzel , & Srinivasan , 2001 ) . Importantly , these species have demonstrated the ability to perform same / different discriminations on stimuli not presented during training , also known as transfer , sug - gesting their ability to acquire a rudimentary conceptual un - derstanding of “ sameness ” that extends beyond perceptual features . Relational MTS ( RMTS ) conditions require the selection of targets that are relationally similar to the sample . Analogical matches ( i . e . , matching AA to BB and not CD ) present a critical condition where many animals — other than chimpanzees , crows , and humans — fail to demon - strate relational abilities ( Holyoak & Thagard , 1995 ) , such as rhesus monkeys ( Flemming , Beran , Thompson , Kleider , & Washburn , 2008 ) . Only after intensive language training using a symbol - based system do chimpanzees demonstrate analogical abilities ( Premack , 1983 ) ; however , hooded crows have remarkably demonstrated spontaneous analogical transfer during RMTS ( Smirnova et al . , 2015 ) . Simply put , RMTS tasks have demonstrated that no other animal species , other than humans , can produce complex relational solutions as easily with minimal instruction or training . Whether analogical ability is a uniquely human 358 Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience Volume 33 , Number 3 ability is highly debated ( see Premack , 2010 ; Penn et al . , 2008 ) and is not the focus of this investigation . Rather , we were interested in the relational abilities of hu - mans that extend beyond analogical matches that Holyoak and Thagard ( 1995 ) surmised as exceeding the limit of chim - panzee relational abilities . Comparing the relations between relations , defined above as a system mapping , requires thinking about second - order relations , in all likeliness a un - ique human ability . Only one study to date has specifically addressed human RMTS performance across the three levels of increasing relational complexity : perceptual , analogical , and system mappings . Kroger et al . ( 2004 ) demonstrated that increases in relational complexity increased processing demands as measured via RTs for correctly solved problems . This pattern of results was seen even after controlling for working memory demands and iconic memory effects . In the interest of isolating processing demands in work - ing memory , Kroger et al . ( 2004 ) carefully trained partici - pants on the relational structure in each condition . We developed a novel task that removed this training require - ment to observe the unstructured learning rates of RMTS problems with increasing relational complexity and inter - ference . RMTS problem stimuli are composed of fractal - like patterns to reduce the influence of semantic processing . Participants were not instructed on how to solve the problems but received feedback after each attempt to facil - itate learning . Because of the increased working memory demands imposed with increasing relational complexity , as well as interference across differing relational structures , we hypothesized that increases in relational complexity would negatively affect participant accuracy . Given that participants received feedback after each trial , we also hypothesized that participants would learn the relational structure of each condition at different rates depending on their relational complexity . Therefore , we predicted that participants would learn the perceptual matches fastest , followed by analogical matches , and then system mappings . In the pursuit of these ideas , two experiments were conducted to further understand factors that con - tribute to variability , as well as improvements , in participant performance when solving RMTS problems . EXPERIMENT 1 Methods Participants Thirty - nine undergraduate students attending The University of Texas at Dallas participated in the experiment in exchange for course credit . One participant was excluded from anal - yses because of extremely long RTs ( > 10 sec on average ) compared with the rest of the sample ; therefore , 38 partic - ipants were included in the analyses presented below ( age : M = 20 . 70 years , SD = 3 . 14 years ; 14 men ; three left - handed ; education : M = 14 . 90 years , SD = 2 . 17 years ) . All participants gave informed consent , and experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the university ’ s institutional review board . Materials RMTS task . We developed a novel RMTS task that uniquely features custom - generated fractal - like images presented as stimuli with no practice and limited instruction . Each RMTS problem was composed of nonsemantic fractal - like patterns that were generated using a modified algorithm based on the work of Miyashita , Higuchi , Sakai , and Masui ( 1991 ) in MATLAB ( R2014b ; algorithm and task code is avail - able in an online GitHub repository : https : / / github . com / mkmiecik14 / fractal - rmts ) . Four hundred ninety - five unique fractal - like images were created such that each problem pre - sented new stimuli that were never repeated throughout the experiment . The fractal - like images were randomly colored across the grayscale spectrum to provide contrast among overlapping elements . To reduce the influence of semantic representations , each problem was visually inspected to ensure stimuli did not resemble shapes seen in everyday life . The generated fractal - like images were used to create three problem types : perceptual , analogical , and system mapping . Each problem type was constructed using three 2 × 2 configurations of fractal images placed against a black background . A single sample set was placed above two target sets that were separated by a white dotted line resembling the traditional format of an MTS task ( see Figure 1A ) . Matches between sample and target sets were determined using only two relationships of “ same ” and “ different . ” The three problem types were identical in their stimulus presentation but differed in the relational com - plexity required to select the correct target . Correct responses to perceptual mapping problems required participants to regard the sets as whole images and select the target set that contained perceptually iden - tical stimuli ( i . e . , relationship of sameness ) represented in the sample set . Analogical mapping problems required participants to regard sets as separable top and bottom pairs of fractals that were either the same or different when evaluating the rela - tionship between the top and bottom pairs of fractals within each set . Within - pair fractals , or fractals that appeared on the same row of the 2 × 2 configuration , on analogical map - ping problems never differed and were always identical im - ages . Correct analogical maps between sample and target sets required identifying identical relationships shared between top and bottom pairs of fractals ( see Figure 1A ) . These relationships varied between both “ same ” and “ dif - ferent , ” thus making it possible to match based on different - ness as well as sameness . System mapping problems , like analogical mapping prob - lems , required pairwise comparisons between top and bot - tom pairs of stimuli within each set ; however , within - pair fractal stimuli now also varied between either being “ same ” or “ different . ” Relationships now varied within pairs as well Kmiecik , Perez , and Krawczyk 359 as between pairs . Correct responses to system mapping problems required participants to evaluate systems of rela - tionships , evaluating the relationships shared within and be - tween pairs as well as across source and target sets ( see Figure 1A ) . Thirty - two problems were constructed for each of the three conditions , for a total of 96 problems . All problems were designed such that inference of relational structures other than those outlined above would result in chance per - formance . In other words , vertical ( i . e . , column - wise compar - isons ) or diagonal comparisons within each set would not provide sufficient information to solve the problems above chance . Targets were counterbalanced so that each condi - tion had an equal number of both left - and right - sided correct responses . This resulted in two problem types for perceptual mapping . Analogical mapping problems were represented across four problem types because of equating left and right target response probabilities and counterbalancing between sample – target matching across both relations of “ same ” and “ different . ” System mapping problems were represented across 32 unique problem types by counterbalancing the following aspects : ( 1 ) left and right target response probabil - ities , ( 2 ) equating the probabilities of “ same ” and “ different ” relational matching across samples and targets , and ( 3 ) en - suring within - pair “ same ” or “ different ” relations appeared equally in both top and bottom slots in each of the three sets . Additional assessments . The RMTS task depicted above was part of a larger study investigating reasoning abilities . Therefore , additional tasks assessing visuospatial working memory , relational abstraction , and analogical reasoning were administered . Participants ’ visuospatial working memory was assessed using the Wechsler Memory Scale – Fourth Edition Symbol Span task ( Wechsler , 2009 ) . The Symbol Span task required participants to observe a series of nonsemantic shapes for 5 sec and then recall them , in order , on a presented sheet of options . The task progressively increases in difficulty by increasing the number of shapes to memorize within the 5 - sec encoding period . Participants ’ visuospatial working Figure 1 . RMTS task conditions and trial procedure . ( A ) Examples of perceptual , analogical , and system mapping problems ( see text for description of counterbalancing and problem types ) . We intended for participants to infer relationships of same ( filled arrows ) and different ( open circles ) that differed based on relational complexity . Correct target choices contained the same relational structure as featured in the sample ; therefore , matches were based on same ( shown here in analogy and system ) and different ( not shown ) . By this definition , perceptual matches were only allowed to match based on same . Correct and incorrect choices are denoted by green checkmarks and red Xs , respectively . ( B ) Participants received feedback after each of the 96 trials and breaks between blocks every 24 trials . All trials were presented on a black background ( white background shown here for illustrative purposes ) . 360 Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience Volume 33 , Number 3 memory ability was quantified using the Wechsler Memory Scale – Fourth Edition Symbol Span total raw score ( maxi - mum score possible was 50 ) . Participants ’ relational abstraction ability was assessed using the Abstraction and Working Memory ( AIM ) task ( Glahn , Cannon , Gur , Ragland , & Gur , 2000 ) . In this com - puterized task , participants were shown five shapes on - screen that were distorted slightly to reduce verbalization : two images at the top left , two images at the top right , and one at the center bottom . Participants were instructed to select via button press whether the left or right pair of images best belonged with the bottom image . Five different relational structures based on combinations of color and shape determined correct matches ( see Glahn et al . , 2000 ) . In the AIM plus Memory subtest , participants were shown the target image for 500 msec that was followed by a blank screen for 2 . 5 sec before the four shapes appeared at the top . In the AIM simple condition , this additional working memory maintenance requirement was reduced by present - ing the target together with the four shapes . Participants ’ re - lational abstraction ability was quantified using the number of correct responses out of a possible 20 trials for each con - dition : ( 1 ) AIM and ( 2 ) AIM plus memory . Participants ’ analogical reasoning ability was assessed using separate verbal and scene - based tasks . The verbal analogies task ( Jones , Kmiecik , Irwin , Unsworth , & Morrison , in preparation ) presented participants with four - term analogies in the form A : B : : C : ? , and participants were instructed to select a D term out of two options pre - sented at the bottom of a computer screen . The verbal analogies were manipulated based on semantic distance shared between the source ( A : B ) and the target ( C : D ) word pair , thus creating semantically near ( JANUARY : MONTH : : WINTER : SEASON ) and far ( LOG : FORT : : CERAMIC : JAR ) analogies . Furthermore , the options of D and D ’ were manipulated for distractor salience by varying the associa - tion between C and D / D ’ . Incorrect choices that were highly associated with the C term were more distracting ( BOWL : DISH : : SPOON : SILVERWARE / FORK ) than those with a lower association ( OATMEAL : COOKIE : : BANANA : MUFFIN / KIWI ) . We quantified verbal analogy performance as overall task accuracy as percentage correct out of 60 total trials collapsing across semantic distance and distracter salience conditions . Scene analogy performance was assessed using the Similar Situations Task ( SST ) developed in - house ( Martinez et al . , in preparation ; Kmiecik , Schauer , Martinez , & Krawczyk , 2016 ) . Briefly , participants were shown 48 line - art scene analogy problems . Each source scene was presented for 5 sec and comprised two sets of items ( humans , animals , or objects ) that interacted in dis - tinct areas within the scene . One or two arrows directed par - ticipants to encode and remember specific items and their relational roles . The target scenes comprised two matching items that interacted analogously to one set of items in the source , whereas two distractor items interacted in a super - ficially similar manner to the alignable items . No - Match problems were identical to matchable problems but did not contain an analogous match . Participants were tasked with determining which item , if any , was in a similar situa - tionas one of thosepointed to in the source by clicking their selection on - screen . Participants were instructed to choose “ No Match ” if they did not find an analogous match . Therefore , the SST had four conditions : one - arrow match , two - arrow match , one - arrow no match , and two - arrow no match . We quantified scene analogy performance as overall accuracy out of 48 trials by collapsing performance across these conditions . Procedure After providing consent , participants were first seated alone in a quiet testing room and administered the SST , verbal analogies , AIM , and Symbol Span tasks . The comput - erized tasks ( i . e . , all tasks except for the Symbol Span ) were displayed on a 17 - in . Dell LCD monitor ( resolution : 1280 × 1024 ) . Participants were then administered the RMTS task and were instructed to place their right index and middle fingers on the “ 1 ” and “ 2 ” keys of the keyboard number pad , respectively . The task was administered using E - Prime 2 . 0 ( SP1 ; Schneider , Eschman , & Zuccolotto , 2012 ) . The experimenter read the following instructions : “ In this experiment , you will be shown three sets of images . One set of images will be shown at the top of the screen , while the other two sets will be shown at the bottom left and bottom right of the screen . Your job is to determine which of the bottom two sets best matches the top set of images . ” Participants were instructed to press the “ 1 ” and “ 2 ” keys to choose the bottom left and right images , respec - tively , and to utilize the feedback after each trial to get as many problems correct as possible . Each trial began with a randomly jittered fixation cross lasting between 500 and 1000 msec . RMTS problems were presented and remained on - screen until a selection was made . Feedback was presented for 500 msec as a green checkmark for correct responses or a red “ X ” for incorrect responses ( see Figure 1B ) . A 500 - msec intertrial interval separated each trial . All 96 problems were pre - sented in a pseudorandom order across four blocks with 24 problems per block . Each block contained an equal number of left and right correct responses , problems from each condition ( i . e . , eight ) , and problem types for perceptual and analogical mapping problems . The 32 un - ique system mapping problems appeared randomly across the blocks and were never repeated . Statistical analyses were performed in R ( Version 3 . 5 . 3 ; R Core Team , 2015 ) and RStudio ( Version 1 . 1 . 456 ) using the dplyr ( Wickham , François , Henry , & Müller , 2018 ) , broom ( Robinson , Hayes , & Couch , 2018 ) , psych ( Revelle , 2019 ) , and lmSupport ( Curtin , 2018 ) packages , and figures were prepared using ggplot2 ( Wickham , 2016 ) and patch - work ( Pederson , 2019 ) . Participant performance was mod - eled using multilevel modeling ( see Judd , McClelland , & Ryan , 2017 ) . In Level 1 , each participant ’ s performance Kmiecik , Perez , and Krawczyk 361 was modeled individually using a priori orthogonal contrast codes for the within - participant factors of block and condi - tion as well as all their interactions . Because of the four blocks , we modeled three separate block contrasts : linear ( − 3 / 2 , − 1 / 2 , 1 / 2 , 3 / 2 ) , quadratic ( 1 / 2 , − 1 / 2 , − 1 / 2 , 1 / 2 ) , and cubic ( − 1 / 2 , 3 / 2 , − 3 / 2 , 1 / 2 ) changes in performance across time / block . Because of the three different condi - tions , we modeled two separate condition contrasts : per - ceptual + analogy versus system mapping ( perceptual = 1 / 3 , analogy = 1 / 3 , system = − 2 / 3 ) and perceptual versus analogy ( perceptual = 1 / 2 , analogy = − 1 / 2 , system = 0 ) . The contrasts were constructed to first evaluate differences between the highest level of relational complexity ( system mappings ) and conditions with lower relational complexity ( perceptual and analogical matches ) . Although people solve perceptual and analogical RMTS problems easily ( Holyoak & Thagard , 1995 ) , we were further interested in performance differences between these conditions when other relational structures may have interfered with learn - ing rates . Constructing the two contrasts in this manner al - lowed us to answer questions of theoretical interest while maintaining orthogonality of contrasts that increased the in - terpretability of the unstandardized regression coefficients ( i . e . , weighted mean difference ) . The dependent variables in Level 1 models were proportion correct rates and RTs for correctly solved problems ( correct RT ) . For the correct RT models , the contrast codes stated above were reversed in sign ( i . e . , multiplied by − 1 ) to reflect predictions that better performance was characterized by reduced RT ( i . e . , faster responses ) . The participants ’ regression estimates ( i . e . , mean differences between condition contrasts ) for each contrast were used as dependent variables in Level 2 models that estimated participant performance in each condition , block , and their interactions ( i . e . , intercept term ) . Results and Discussion Participant performance on Experiment 1 was well differ - entiated based on the condition and progress ( i . e . , block ) through the task . The participants learned the perceptual matching problems the fastest with near - ceiling perfor - mance throughout the task , whereas analogy and system mapping problems were more slowly learned with vari - able performance ( see Figure 2 ) . Descriptive statistics of condition - and block - wise performance are described in Table 1 . Multilevel modeling results demonstrated several signif - icant within - participant effects for block , condition , and their interactions for both proportion correct and correct RT models ( see Table 2 ) . The participants ’ proportion Figure 2 .

Transparent lines indicate individual participant performance and are slightly jittered to reveal individual differences . Points with SEM error bars represent mean performance . 362 Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience Volume 33 , Number 3 correct rates across the four blocks when collapsing across conditions were described by both a linear increase and a fluctuating cubic function , whereas correct RT performance demonstrated linear , quadratic , and cubic changes . When collapsing performance across block , participants were more accurate and faster at solving perceptual and analogy prob - lems ( combined ) compared to system mapping problems . Furthermore , participants were more accurate and faster at solving perceptual problems compared to analogies . These mean differences of condition interacted with pre - sentation block . The participants improved in their analogy performance with both linear ( proportion correct and cor - rect RT ) and quadratic ( correct RT only ) changes across blocks , whereas perceptual matching performance did not change from high - ceiling performance . In addition , a quadratic effect of block for proportion correct rates was observed that depended on the perceptual and analogy ( combined ) versus system mapping condition contrast . Experiment 1 results suggest markedly different perfor - mance patterns across blocks depending on the relational complexity of the problem . For proportion correct rates , sys - tem mapping problems were characterized by a quadratic function , with a decrease before an increase in performance across time , whereas performance for solving analogies tended to linearly increase across the task blocks . Perceptual matching performance remained at ceiling across all four blocks . Correct RTs mainly differentiated perceptual from analogy performance across blocks , demonstrating improvements in learning of analogies via faster RTs with both linear and rapid initial improvement ( i . e . , quadratic ) compared to perceptual matches that were quickly learned . Taken together , these results support our hypothesis that increasing levels of relational complexity differentially affect participant learning rates for relational structures . Despite minimal instructions , participants immediately learned the perceptual matches . Near - perfect perfor - mance on perceptual matchings was expected and further demonstrates the salience that perceptual “ sameness ” exerts on human decision - making ( Holyoak & Thagard , 1995 ) , especially given that each perceptual RMTS trial is test of transfer ( i . e . , all trials used unique , never repeated , stimuli ) . Analogy and system mapping performance was characterized by a positive linear slope and a nonlinear quadratic function , respectively , across trial blocks . The difference in these learning rates suggests that increasing relational complexity does not result in monotonic changes to working memory demand ; otherwise , participant perfor - mance across increasing levels of relational complexity should have resulted in similar linear patterns across blocks . We believe our experimental design introduced addi - tional interference of relational structures by presenting all conditions equally and randomly within each block . Given that participants received minimal instructions and no practice trials before RMTS task administration , it is likely that the analogical relational structure interfered with participants ’ ability to learn the system mappings . The initial decrease in system mapping performance is perhaps explained either by the participants ’ application of the analogical relational structure to system mapping problems or by the application of other incorrect strate - gies . For example , the application of a vertical or diagonal , rather than the imposed horizontal , solution strategy to any of the three conditions would result in chance levels of performance ( see Methods ) . In addition , incorrectly ap - plying a relational structure from a different condition would also result in chance performance . Therefore , we Table 1 .

Kmiecik , Perez , and Krawczyk 363 surmise that the additional relational interference across conditions contributed to the nonmonotonic differences between levels of increasing relational complexity . EXPERIMENT 2 The system mapping problems in Experiment 1 were the most relationally complex problems . Solving the system mapping problems required the participants to perform an analogy of analogies . However , we were still surprised at the participants ’ rather low performance on the system mapping problems in Experiment 1 . Participants achieved a mean accuracy of only 70 . 39 % ( SD = 19 . 8 % ) in the final block , despite having 24 learning trials across the first three blocks . Given the minimal instructions presented before the task , it is likely that some participants may have used nonrelational strategies ( e . g . , perceptual strategies based on color matching or orientation of fractal - like Table 2 .

One method thought to foster relational reasoning and invite deeper relational comparisons is to utilize relational lan - guage ( Gentner , 2016 ; Vendetti et al . , 2015 ) . Gick and Holyoak ( 1980 , 1983 ) demonstrated that spontaneous an - alogical transfer between semantically disparate domains is difficult but improves when reasoners are given explicit hints to compare these domains . Although the fractal - like stimuli are minimally semantic , using explicit relational language in the instructions may encourage relational comparisons and discourage more perceptual strategies . Therefore , to improve system mapping performance , we presented a new sample of participants with the same task as described in Experiment 1 except for a slight in - structional manipulation . In Experiment 2 , participants were given an additional line of instructions that read “ Be sure to attend to how the images are same or differ - ent ” before beginning the task . We hypothesized that this subtle additional line of instructions would encourage re - lational thinking , while reducing the use of distracting nonrelational solving strategies . We predicted this hint might be sufficient to raise performance in Experiment 2 , especially for relationally complex problems like the analogy and system mappings , in the form of faster learn - ing rates , overall higher accuracies , and faster correct RTs compared to Experiment 1 . Methods Participants Seventy - two undergraduate students ( age : M = 21 . 10 years , SD = 3 . 04 years ; 34 men ; seven left - handed , one ambidex - trous ; education : M = 14 . 60 years , SD = 1 . 45 years ) attend - ing The University of Texas at Dallas participated in the experiment in exchange for course credit . One participant was excluded from the correct RT analysis because of incor - rectly answering all system mapping problems in Block 3 ; therefore , the final sample for the proportion correct anal - ysis was n = 72 , whereas that for the correct RT analysis was n = 71 . All participants gave informed consent , and exper - imental procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the university ’ s institutional review board . Materials and Procedure All materials and procedures were identical to those described in Experiment 1 ( see above ) except for an addi - tional line of instructions presented before the participants beginning the task . The participants were read the same instructions in the same order as described above . After these instructions , the participants were read , “ Be sure to attend to how the images are same or different . ” The task began immediately after the participants indicated they understood these instructions . The same statistical procedure used to model Experiment 1 performance was replicated when estimating Experiment 2 performance . In addition , we modeled the effect of Experiment 1 ( − 0 . 5 ) versus Experiment 2 ( + 0 . 5 ) as a between - participant factor in Level 2 of the multilevel model to examine whether the instructional manipulation af - fected participant performance . The signs of these con - trast codes were reversed ( i . e . , multiplied by − 1 ) for the correct RT analysis to reflect decreased RT associated with better performance . Results and Discussion Similar to Experiment 1 , the participants ’ performance across blocks also depended on the relational complexity of the problems in Experiment 2 ( see Figure 2 and Table 1 for descriptive statistics ) that was well described with both linear and quadratic changes ( see Table 3 ) . In contrast to perceptual matches , which were solved at near ceiling throughout the experiment , analogical comparisons were best characterized by a linear increase and quadratic change in both proportion correct rates and correct RTs , suggesting dramatic initial performance increases between Blocks 1 and 2 ( see Perceptual vs . Analogy contrasts in Table 3 ) . In comparison to perceptual and analogical com - parisons , the more relationally complex system mapping problems were better characterized by a quadratic function than a linear decrease in proportion correct rates , suggest - ing participants performed worse before improving at the fourth block . When comparing the proportional reduction in error ( also known as η p2 ) , these results suggest that system mapping performance was better characterized by a quadratic change over block , whereas analogy perfor - mance is better characterized as a linear improvement . The results of Experiment 2 replicate those of Experiment 1 by further demonstrating that participants learn the rela - tional structures of perceptual , analogy , and system mapping problems at different rates when given minimal instruction . Furthermore , we compared whether participant perfor - mance across Experiments 1 and 2 was modulated by the additional line of instructions given in Experiment 2 ( i . e . , “ Be sure to attend to how the images are same or different . ” ) by adding “ Experiment ” as a between - participant factor in a regression model . Participants across Experiments 1 and 2 did not differ in age , t ( 108 ) = 0 . 61 , p = . 55 , sex , χ 2 ( 1 ) = 0 . 71 , p = . 40 , and years of education , t ( 108 ) = − 0 . 86 , p = . 39 . We observed three between - participant interactions of experiment , suggesting reliable differences in participant performance across tasks that is likely attributable to the instructional manipulation ( multilevel modeling results are presented in Table 4 for proportion correct and Table 5 for correct RTs ) . More specifically , the effect of experiment interacted with the linear differences between perceptual versus analogy conditions in both proportion correct rates and correct RTs , such that solving analogies improved at a faster rate ( i . e . , steeper linear slope ) when participants were directed to attend to the relational Kmiecik , Perez , and Krawczyk 365 properties of the problems ( Experiment 2 ) compared to when these additional instructions were not given ( Experiment 1 ; see Figure 3 ) . We also observed a quadratic difference between perceptual and analogy correct RTs , suggesting that the relational hint impacted participant solving strategies resulting in facilitated initial acquisition of analogies compared to perceptual matches . Together , improved proportion correct rates and faster correct RTs suggest that our instructional manipulation may have fa - cilitated relational comparisons by directing participants ’ attention to relationally compare items . However , this interpretation is limited given the between - participant nature of this design ( e . g . , Experiment 2 participants performed worse in Block 1 so they had more opportunity to improve ) . Our primary aim was to examine learning rates of complex relational structures over time with Table 3 .

Although limited in inference , a between - participant design was a necessary concession to examine the navigation of relational structures with limited prior experience and instruction . When collapsing across experiments , the participants demonstrated several repeated - measures interactions as indicated by significant intercepts . Linear and quadratic learning rates across blocks well described the differences between analogy and perceptual matches for both propor - tion correct rates and correct RTs . System mapping pro - portion correct rates , but not correct RTs , were again described by quadratic changes — first decrease before in - crease in performance — compared to the combined per - ceptual and analogy performance . These results further suggest that relational complexity interacts with learning rates , however , not in a monotonic pattern . System map - pings , which are the most relationally complex , were bet - ter characterized by initial difficulties in learning , whereas Table 4 .

PERFORMANCE TYPES When further examining the raw data across the different experiments ( see Figure 2 ) , we noticed that several par - ticipants achieved rather high proportion correct rates in the final block on system mapping problems than the group mean suggested . The pattern of participant perfor - mance suggested two groups of individuals : ( 1 ) those who learned the system mappings and ( 2 ) those who failed to learn their relational structure . To further exam - ine this idea , we divided participants into two groups based on their system mapping performance on the fourth block .

Before the task , Experiment 2 presented an additional line of instructions cueing participants to pay attention to how stimuli were same or different . Participants in Experiment 2 demonstrated elevated performance as evidenced by steeper linear slopes in the analogy condition for both outcome measures . An additional quadratic fit for correct RTs suggests this initial acquisition for analogies was more rapid in Experiment 2 . Kmiecik , Perez , and Krawczyk 369 determined by system mapping accuracy on the fourth block , this factor differentiated performance on the entire task such that higher performers , despite responding 902 msec slower , correctly solved 13 % more RTMS problems than lower performers . Furthermore , higher and lower per - formers were differentiated in RMTS analogy performance . Perceptual matching performance was comparable between the groups , although higher performers correctly answered more analogy problems than lower performers ( see Figure 4 ) . In contrast , perceptual and analogy condi - tions did not differ between performance types for correct RTs ; rather , correct RTs differentiated system mappings from analogy and perceptual matches ( combined ) such that higher performers took longer to solve system map - pings compared to lower performers ( see Figure 4 ) . We interpret these effects to mean that higher performers were generally more relationally minded than lower per - formers and were better able to discern the difference between analogy and system mapping relational structures despite interference ; however , this increase in accuracy for higher performers resulted in increased RTs that likely reflect a speed – accuracy tradeoff driven by the relational comparisons . Importantly , block and condition effects interacted , resulting in performance type interactions in proportion correct rates with linear and quadratic changes in perceptual + analogy ( combined ) versus system mapping performance ( see Figure 4 ) . When comparing the effect of performance type to the effect of experiment ( i . e . , instruc - tional manipulation ) , as presented above , it is clear that performance types were stronger in differentiating perfor - mance than the instructional manipulation presented in Experiment 2 . Higher performers — those who achieved above - chance performance on system mapping problems by the end of the experiment — learned the various rela - tional structures at a different rate than lower performers . This ability to learn the system mapping relational struc - ture also benefited in the analogy condition , with higher performers achieving greater solving rates than lower performers . When inspecting correct RTs , performance type inter - acted with the cubic effect of block on perceptual + analogy ( combined ) versus system mappings ( see Figure 4 ) . While solving system mappings , higher performers responded slower in Block 3 after an initial improvement with faster correct RTs between Blocks 1 and 2 . In contrast , lower performers did not perform slower for correct problems during Block 3 system mappings but responded increas - ingly faster throughout the course of the experiment . Combined with the low performance in Block 3 system mappings ( inaccurate and slow RTs ) , higher performers appear affected by interference of competing relational structures , likely the analogy structures . To further explore this possibility , we computed Pearson correlations with bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) be - tween analogy and system mapping performance across block and performance type for proportion correct rates and correct RTs . The presence of negative correlations would support the idea that increases in analogy solving would interfere and result in decreased system mapping performance . The correlations of higher performers for proportion correct rates demonstrated all positive correlations ( see Figure 4 ) : Block 1 , r = . 52 , 95 % CI [ . 28 , . 70 ] ; Block 2 , r = . 18 [ − . 10 , . 44 ] ; Block 3 , r = . 5 [ . 25 , . 68 ] ; and Block 4 , r = . 37 [ . 10 , . 59 ] . Meanwhile , lower performers demonstrated both Table 6 .

Despite the neg - ative correlations not reaching significance ( i . e . , 95 % CIs crossed zero ) for lower performers , we observed a trending negative correlation for Block 2 ( p = . 06 ) and characteris - tically different patterns in correlations between higher and lower performers , especially in Block 3 , providing support - ive evidence of interference in lower performers . In con - trast , analogy and system mapping correct RTs were all positively correlated and significant for higher performers — Block 1 , r = . 46 [ . 20 , . 65 ] ; Block 2 , r = . 47 [ . 22 , . 66 ] ; Block 3 , r = . 58 [ . 36 , . 74 ] ; and Block 4 , r = . 62 [ . 41 , . 77 ] — and lower performers — Block 1 , r = . 52 [ . 31 , . 69 ] ; Block 2 , r = . 49 [ . 27 , . 67 ] ; Block 3 , r = . 68 [ . 52 , . 80 ] ; and Block 4 , r = . 77 [ . 64 , . 86 ] . These similar positive correla - tions suggest that RTs , when correctly solving analogy and system mapping RMTS problems , shared similar solving patterns between higher and lower performers ; however , correct RTs speak less toward interference effects because of their inclusion of only correctly solved trials and there - fore , by definition , have fewer trials .

Kmiecik , Perez , and Krawczyk 371 Individuals classified as higher performers above also performed better on separate tasks of visuospatial work - ing memory ( i . e . , symbol span ) , abstraction ( i . e . , AIM and AIM + memory ) , and verbal and scene - based analogical reasoning ( i . e . , verbal analogies and the SST , respectively ; see Table 9 ) . This widespread differentiation in perfor - mance types suggests that the RMTS task used in this investigation provided an excellent measure of reasoning that was sensitive to individual differences and general fluid intelligence abilities . Higher performers demonstrated competence and understanding of system mappings given their elevated Block 4 performance ( M = 85 % , SD = 6 % ) compared to lower performers who hovered around chance performance ( M = 50 % , SD = 13 % ) . Given higher performers additionally performed better across all additional assessments that required attention to and maintenance of relational information , even across temporal delays in the case of AIM + memory and SST , it is likely that these individuals have elevated working memory capacities to ( 1 ) process relationally complex sit - uations that are novel and ( 2 ) face interference .

Kmiecik , Perez , and Krawczyk 373 several challenging tasks that required participants to face novel situations / stimuli to detect relational patterns and develop strategies for accurate performance . Conclusion This investigation explored how humans reason through increasingly complex relationships . Using a novel variant of the RMTS task , we demonstrated that increasingly complex relational structures differentially affected accu - racy rates and correct RTs when participants were given problems without practice , minimal instructions , and feedback after each selection . Participants quickly learned perceptual and analogical mappings ; however , not all participants learned the most relationally complex structure of system mappings . To improve task perfor - mance , we directed the participants ’ attention to the re - lational properties of “ sameness ” and “ difference ” in Experiment 2 . This had a modest effect on improving analogy performance but did not translate into improving system mapping performance . The effect of instructions notwithstanding , whether participants performed above chance on system mappings in the experiments ’ final block highly differentiated participant performance on not only the RMTS task but also tasks of visuospatial working memory , abstraction , and verbal / scene - based analogy . Given the differentiating linear , quadratic , and even cubic effects on the analogy and system mapping conditions , respectively , we argue that discerning in - creasingly complex relational structures places nonmono - tonic demands on working memory . We believe this is likely a function of our experimental design with partici - pants , especially those who have lower working memory abilities and place less emphasis on relational properties ( i . e . , lower performers ) , needing to resolve interference because of differences in relational structures ; however , our experiments were not designed to fully test theories of interference in working memory . Therefore , future studies would be well served to further explore how in - terference competes with relational complexity in work - ing memory . Our two - experiment study demonstrated that perfor - mance on a nonsemantic RMTS task is quite variable . Even young college - educated people do not always effec - tively solve the system mapping problems , despite when provided immediate feedback on their performance . This ability to learn and understand complex relational struc - tures relies on a variety of cognitive abilities that support relational thinking , including working memory and inter - ference control . System mapping performance remains a dividing line among primates ( Penn et al . , 2008 ; Holyoak & Thagard , 1995 ) , and further understanding the cogni - tive substrates of this divide , as well as the individual dif - ferences within humans , will aid our understanding on the basis of relational comparison and related cognitive abilities that contribute to intellect .
