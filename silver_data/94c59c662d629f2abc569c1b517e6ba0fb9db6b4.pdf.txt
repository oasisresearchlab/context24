ARTICLE Stochastic gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana Ilka Schultheiß Araújo 1 , Jessica Magdalena Pietsch 1 , Emma Mathilde Keizer 2 , Bettina Greese 3 , Rachappa Balkunde 1 , Christian Fleck 2 & Martin Hülskamp 1 Although plant development is highly reproducible , some stochasticity exists . This devel - opmental stochasticity may be caused by noisy gene expression . Here we analyze the ﬂ uctuation of protein expression in Arabidopsis thaliana . Using the photoconvertible KikGR marker , we show that the protein expressions of individual cells ﬂ uctuate over time . A dual reporter system was used to study extrinsic and intrinsic noise of marker gene expression . We report that extrinsic noise is higher than intrinsic noise and that extrinsic noise in stomata is clearly lower in comparison to several other tissues / cell types . Finally , we show that cells are coupled with respect to stochastic protein expression in young leaves , hypocotyls and roots but not in mature leaves . Our data indicate that stochasticity of gene expression can vary between tissues / cell types and that it can be coupled in a non - cell - autonomous manner .

At the cellular and molecular level , however , a surprisingly high degree of stochas - ticity is observed 1 . One way to look at stochasticity is that it may be a problem to establish regularity . On the other hand , sto - chasticity might be important to break the homogeneity , which is necessary for correct pattern formation 2 , 3 . In plants , stochasticity during development is best described for leaf growth . Here no correlation between growth rates and cell sizes , nuclear sizes and anisotropy was found 4 . Similarly , the length of the cell cycle and the time point at which cells switch to endoreduplication was found to be stochastic in sepals 5 . Recently , it was demonstrated that ﬂ uctuations of the transcription factor ATML1 initiate the spatial distribution of giant cells in sepals 6 . The characteristics and basis of stochastic gene expression was analyzed in various organisms including bacteria , yeast , mam - malian cell cultures , Dictyostelium discoideum , Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster 7 – 15 . The overall noise of gene expression in a given cell can be divided into two components 8 . Extrinsic noise equally affects the expression of all genes in a cell , for example , because of differences in the number of RNA poly - merases or ribosomes between cells . Intrinsic noise is due to the inherent stochasticity of molecular processes in ﬂ uencing transcription and translation . As a consequence , the expression of individual genes ﬂ uctuates over time . In this work we analyze the noisiness of gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana with emphasis on two questions : First , is intrinsic and extrinsic noise different in different tissues or cell types ? It might be expected that stochasticity changes during cell differentiation or endoreduplication . Endoreduplication leads to higher copy numbers of genomes , which could balance the ﬂ uc - tuation of individual gene copies and a reduction of intrinsic noise . Second , is stochasticity of gene expression coupled between cells in a tissue ? This could be the case because cellular conditions are inheritated during cell divisions or because plant cells are well connected with each other through plasmodesmata 16 such that they could cross regulate and balance each others transcription . We demonstrate that gene expression ﬂ uctuatuates over time . In addition , we show that extrinsic noise is higher than intrinsic noise and that extrinsic noise in stomata is lower than in other tissues / cell types . Our spatial analysis of stochastic gene expres - sion revealed coupling between cells in some but not all tissues . Results Temporal analysis of ﬂ uctuations .

In a ﬁ rst experiment , we aimed to detect a temporal correlation of protein expression in intact plant leaves by determining the correlation of protein levels between different time points ( auto - correlation ) 20 . Towards this end we developed the following experimental setup : ( 1 ) We decided to compare the protein levels at only two time points because the experiments have to be done with excised leaves and prolonged maintenance is expected to produce artefacts . ( 2 ) Under steady state expression , we had dif ﬁ culties to detect relative differences of protein levels within 3 h time intervals . We therefore used the photoconvertible NLS - KikGR . KikGR can be irreversibly converted from a green ﬂ uorescent protein ( KikG ) to red ﬂ uorescent protein ( KikR ) by 405 nm illumination 21 . Using this system we determined the production of new proteins 22 by converting KikG to KikR fol - lowed by the quanti ﬁ cation of newly produced green ﬂ uorescent KikG after 3 and 6 h . ( 3 ) We targeted the ﬂ uorescent protein to the nucleus by adding a NLS sequence to facilitate the selection of single cells . ( 4 ) We expressed NLS - KikGR under the strong ubiquitously and constitutively active cauli ﬂ ower 35S and the UBIQUITIN10 ( UBQ10 ) promoters . Fairly strong constitutive promoters were choosen to reach suf ﬁ ciently high expression levels and thereby ﬂ uorescence intensities to measure ﬂ uctua - tions . Although this limits general conclusions , this procedure should result in a conservative estimation of intrinsic noise in our experiments as experimental data and theoretical considerations show that constitutive promoters show the lowest intrinsic noise 8 , 23 . Two different promoters were selected to exclude that we are exploring a speci ﬁ c property of one promoter . ( 5 ) We excluded that movement of NLS - KikGR between cells leads to correlation between neighbouring cells by using a KikGR protein version that forms tetramers 21 which should not move between cells . We con ﬁ rmed this by expressing the KikGR protein in single epidermal Arabidopsis cells by biolistic transformation . In these experiments we found no ﬂ uorescence in the neighbouring cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1d - e 21 , 24 ) . For the temporal correlation analysis , transgenic p35S : NLS - KikGR and pUBQ10 : NLS - KikGR Arabidopsis leaves were dis - sected and kept in darkness for 36 h to reduce the amount of already converted red NLS - KikR protein . NLS - KikG was converted to the NLS - KikR by confocal laser scanning micro - scopy ( CLSM ) . The amount of KikG was determined at three time points ( 0 h , 3 h and 6 h , Figs . 1a , b ) . To minimize technical errors and to control bleaching effects we measured each nucleus at each time point two times and used the mean for further calculations . We used at least three biological replicas to determine the average Spearman and Pearson ’ s correlation coef ﬁ cients of the ﬂ uorescence levels between the 3 - h intervals : p35S : NLS - KikGR ( number of leaves = 4 , n = 393 cells , Spearman ' s : r = 0 . 83 , Pearson ' s : r = 0 . 88 , example leaf : Fig . 1c , Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , pUBQ10 : NLS - KikGR ( number of leaves = 3 , n = 153 cells , Spearman ' s : r = 0 . 76 , Pearson ' s : r = 0 . 80 , example leaf : Fig . 1d , Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Control experiments with p35S : NLS - KikGR plants without the 36 h dark treatment exhibited ﬂ uctuations in a similar range ( number of leaves = 10 , n = 465 cells , Spearman ' s : r = 0 . 59 , Pearson ' s : r = 0 . 68 , Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . The ﬁ nding that the correlations coef ﬁ cients were always clearly below 1 ( perfect correlation ) indicates that we can detect ﬂ uctuations between the two 3 - h time intervals . In order to put the experimentally determined correlation coef ﬁ cients into a context we used a modelling approach aiming to address two questions : Is the linear two - stage model shown in Fig . 2 a suf ﬁ cient to explain the data ? How does cell - to - cell variability affect the decay of the auto - correlation ? Towards this end , we analytically calculated the non - stationary auto - correlation function of the linear two - stage model with a DNA 1800 405 nm pulse KikGKikR 1600 1400 1200 1000 P r o t e i n abundan c e ( a . u . ) 800 600 400 200 0 1 CV = 0 CV = 0 . 22 Experimental measurements c 0 ( t 2 , t 1 ) 0 . 9 0 . 8 0 . 7 0 . 6 0 . 5 A u t o - c o rr e l a t i on 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 00 2 4 6 8 10 t 2 – t 1 ( h ) – 20 0 3 6 Time ( h ) 20 40 V 0 V 1 d 0 d 1 mRNA Protein a b c Fig . 2 Theoretical analysis of ﬂ uctuations . a Schematic illustration of the two - stage stochastic gene expression model . v = production rate , d = degradation rate . ( b ) Modelling of three stochastic realizations of the KikGR reporter . After a 405nm pulse the green ﬂ uorescence - emitting KikG is transformed into red ﬂ uorescence - emitting KikR . The auto - correlation between KikG at 3h and 6h is calculated . Parameters are : ν 0 = 2 . 25 h − 1 , d 0 = 1 . 125 h − 1 , d 1 = 0 . 09 h − 1 and ν 1 = 41 . 825 h − 1 , ν 1 = 48 . 506 h − 1 , ν 1 = 46 . 069 h − 1 for the three different trajectories . ( c ) Modelling of the non - stationary auto - correlation of the two - stage gene expression model in presence of extrinsic noise ( crosses and triangles ) as calculated from stochastic simulation of the KikGR reporter from 10 5 trajectories ( Supplementary Note 1 ) and the theoretical non - stationary auto - correlation of a birth - death process c 0 ( t 2 , t 1 ) ( black solid line ) as a lower bound of the non - stationary auto - correlation ( Supplementary Note 1 ) . The extrinsic noise is simulated as cell - to - cell variations in the protein translation rate ν 1 with different coef ﬁ cients of variation ( CV ) . Parameters for the two - stage model are : ν 0 = 2 . 25h − 1 , d 0 = 1 . 125h − 1 , d 1 = 0 . 09h − 1 and < ν 1 > = 45h − 1 . In the case of no extrinsic noise ( Var ( ν 1 ) = 0h − 2 , blue triangles ) , the auto - correlation of the two - stage model approaches that of the birth - death model . With increasing extrinsic noise ( Var ( ν 1 ) = 100h − 2 , red crosses ) the auto - correlation increases . The reason for this is that the covariance and the variance become dominated by the extrinsic noise , for which a much longer correlation time was assumed NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 02285 - 7 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 2132 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 02285 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 3 stochastic translation rate v 1 as a source of extrinsic noise ( Supplementary Note 1 ) . We further simulated the stochastic KikGR system . In Fig . 2b we show example trajectories before and after the converting light pulse . In order to make a prediction for the value of the temporal auto - correlation between 6 h and 3 h after the conversion we need to obtain estimates for the model parameters . We estimated the degradation rate d 1 of KikR using the measured values of the red ﬂ uorescent protein at 3 h and 6 h after conversion ( Supplementary Note 1 ; d 1 = 0 . 09 h − 1 ± 0 . 023 h − 1 ) . The other model parameters are unknown and it is not easy to obtain reliable estimates . However , we can show that the auto - correlation for the non - stationary two - stage process with extrinsic translational noise is bounded from below by the much simpler auto - correlation function of the one - stage death - birth process ( taking only protein production and decay into account ) , which only depends on the stability of the protein ( Fig . 2c , Supplementary Note 1 , Supplementary Fig . 24 ) . According to this we estimated the value r for auto - correlation of the KiKG gene expression between 3 h and 6 h to be in the range 1 ≥ r ≥ 0 . 6 ( Supplementary Note 1 ) . Our experimental data are consistent with this expectation suggesting that the two - stage model provides a good estimate for the underlying noise . Cell - to - cell variability prolongs the auto - correlation time , given that the correlation time of the extrinsic noise is longer than the correlation time of the intrinsic ﬂ uctuations ( an assumption underlying our analytical calculations , Supplementary Note 1 ) . Extrinsic and intrinsic noise in different tissues . To enable a spatial analysis of the intrinsic and extrinsic noise we adopted a dual reporter strategy initially used in bacteria and yeast ( Fig . 3a ) 8 , 12 . Extrinsic noise is seen when both marker values correlate and show the same variation . Intrinsic noise is recognized when the two marker values are not correlated in single - cell measurements . We generated transgenic plants expressing 2xNLS - YFP and 2xNLS - CFP under the control of the 35S promoter . We used YFP and CFP fusions to two nuclear localization signals ( 2xNLS ) for two reasons . First , by targeting the signal to one de ﬁ ned region in the cell , the nucleus , we improved the accuracy of measurements . Second , the targeting of the marker to the nucleus reduces the intercellular mobility that would lead to an underestimation of ﬂ uctuations 24 ( Supplementary Note 2 , Supplementary Fig . 1a - c , e ) . The analysis of pavement cells in young and mature rosette leaf stages revealed intrinsic and extrinsic noise . As shown in Fig . 3b the colour of individual nuclei ranged from green to magenta in merged YFP / CFP pictures indicating that the relative expression of the two 35S promoters driving 2xNLS - CFP and 2xNLS - YFP differs from cell to cell . This is indicative for intrinsic noise . Plotting the mean CFP values against the mean YFP values revealed intrinsic and extrinsic noise for young and mature leaves ( representative leaf shown in Fig . 3c , d , Supplementary Figs . 5 and 6 ) . The statistical analysis revealed signi ﬁ cantly higher extrinsic noise than intrinsic noise ( Supplementary Note 3 , Fig . 3e , f , young leaf : p = 1 . 1×10 − 5 and mature leaf : p = 7 . 6×10 − 5 , Wilcoxon rank - sum test ) . Thus , extrinsic noise is the major source of noisy gene expression in young and mature rosette leaves . This parallels previous ﬁ ndings in yeast 2 , 20 , 25 .

To test whether the high extrinsic noise is speci ﬁ c to the 35S promoter , we also tested the UBQ10 promoter . Stably transformed pUBQ10 : 2xNLS - YFP pUBQ10 : 2xNLS - CFP Arabidopsis plants revealed similar behaviour as described for the 35S promoter ( Supplementary Fig . 7c - e , Supplementary Fig . 10 , Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . These ﬁ ndings raised the question whether noise differs in different cell types or tissues . We therefore determined the noise additionally in stomata , epidermal hypocotyls and root tip cells of p35S : 2xNLS - YFP p35S : 2xNLS - CFP plants ( Fig . 4 , Supplementary Figs . 12 – 18 ) . Intrinsic and extrinsic noise were found in a similar range in all tissues / cell types except for stomata . For stomata we found a clearly and signi ﬁ cantly lower extrinscic noise in both independent transgenic lines ( root / stomata : p = 0 . 0007 , p = 0 . 03 , hypocotyl / stomata : p = 0 . 0002 , p = 0 . 03 , pavement cells in young leaves / stomata ( p = 1 . 08×10 − 5 , p = 0 . 006 , Wilcoxon rank - sum test ) . This indicates that extrinsic noise can vary in a tissue / cell type speci ﬁ c manner . Noise in cells with different DNA contents . Next we tested the concept whether higher endoreduplication levels lead to reduced noise . We took advantage of the fact that pavement cells exhibit a wide range of ploidy levels between 2C and 64C 4 , 26 . This allowed us to study the correlation between ploidy and noise for one speci ﬁ c cell type . As higher DNA contents lead to increased nuclear sizes , we used the maximal area of each nucleus as an estimator for the DNA content in our correlation studies 27 . We determined the maximal nuclear area of leaf epidermal cells in a stack of images and analyzed the YFP and CFP values . We esti - mated the median of nuclear area of all pavement nuclei and considered four quartiles separately in p35S : 2xNLS - YFP p35S : 2xNLS - CFP and pUBQ10 : 2xNLS - YFP pUBQ10 : 2xNLS - CFP plants . Intrinsic noise levels were similar in all four quartiles ( Supplementary Fig . 19 b – e ; Supplementary Fig . 20b ) . This ﬁ nding is not unexpected as already two gene copies in a diploid cell might be suf ﬁ cient to balance ﬂ uctuations in one of them . For extrinsic noise we observed the trend that larger nuclei have slightly more extrinsic noise ( Supplementary Fig . 19c , f ; Supple - mentary Fig . 20c ) . Increased extrinsic noise in larger cells could be explained by less uniform cellular states in cells with a higher DNA content or by changes due to a progression of cell differentiation . Correlation of noise between neighbouring cells . Finally , we aimed to understand whether ﬂ uctuation in gene expression is coupled in neighbouring cells . In contrast to unicellular bacteria or yeast one could envision that in tissues extrinsic noise might be correlated in immediately neighbouring cells . This could result from initially similar cellular conditions in daughter cells or cel - lular connectivity of plant cells by plasmodesmata . To exclude that the low movement rates of the ﬂ uorescent marker protein used in this study leads to a correlation between neighbouring cells we estimated the transport coef ﬁ cient for the mobility between cells . We found that the contribution to a cell - cell cor - relation due to mobility of the ﬂ uorescent protein is negligible CFP R oo t t i p H y po c o t y l YFP Merge 60 40 E x t r i n s i c no i s e * 10 2 20 0 Root tip Hypocotyl Stomata Root tip Hypocotyl Stomata 60 40 I n t r i n s i c no i s e * 10 2 20 0 a b c Fig . 4 Intrinsic and extrinsic noise in stomata cells , root tip cells and hypocotyl cells of p35S : 2xNLS - YFP p35S : 2xNLS - CFP plants . a CLSM images of a root tip and a hypocotyl of p35S : 2xNLS - YFP p35S : 2xNLS - CFP plants .

The extrinsic noise in root tip cells and hypocotyl cells was signi ﬁ cantly higher than in stomata cells ( p = 0 . 00067 and p = 0 . 00025 , Wilcoxon rank - sum test ) NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 02285 - 7 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 2132 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 02285 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 5 ( Supplementary Note 2 ) . We reasoned that the intrinsic gene expression noise is mechanistically decoupled between cells , i . e . , the expression of the ﬂ uorescent protein in one cell does not in ﬂ uence the expression in another cell . Moreover , due to cell division the stochastic gene expression in the growing tissue is never in stationary state . This would yield an extra contribution from the intrinsic noise if one would analyze the spatial corre - lation using a single reporter system ( Supplementary Note 2 ) . However , using the dual reporter p35S : 2xNLS - YFP p35S : 2xNLS - CFP plants for a cross - analysis ( relating CFP to YFP and vice versa , see Fig . 5a ) we can estimate the variance of the extrinsic noise ( e . g . , variability in ribosome number , transcription factor abundance 28 , 29 ) and the covariance between the extrinsic noise of neighbouring cells ( Fig . 5b ) . The covariance between stochasti - cally identical cells is equal to the variance of the extrinsic noise . Therefore , it is necessary to normalize the covariance using the YFP 150 150 YFP / CFP 2 . 4 0 . 6 100 100 50 50 p35S : 2xNLS - YFP p35S : 2xNLS - CFP y c oo r d i na t e ( µ m ) CFP YFP CFP t t YFP CFP t YFP CFP t YFP CFP t x coordinate ( µ m ) 3 . 0 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 0 – 0 . 2 1st tier 2nd tier 3rd tier 4th tier 5th tier Distance to cell 3 . 0 N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e i n t en s i t y o f nea r e s t ne i ghbou r c e ll C o rr e l a t i on c oe ff i c i en t 2 . 5 2 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 5 Normalized fluorescence intensity of cell 1 . 0 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 0 3 . 0 3 . 0 N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e i n t en s i t y o f nea r e s t ne i ghbou r c e ll 2 . 5 2 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 5 Normalized fluorescence intensity of cell 1 . 0 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 0 Young leaf Young leaf 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 0 – 0 . 2 1st tier 2nd tier 3rd tier 4th tier 5th tier C o rr e l a t i on c oe ff i c i en t Young leaf Mature leaf CFP1 , YFP2 YFP1 , CFP2 3 . 0 3 . 0 N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e i n t en s i t y o f nea r e s t ne i ghb ou r c e ll 2 . 5 2 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 5 Normalized fluorescence intensity of cell 1 . 0 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 0 Young leaf CFP1 , YFP2 YFP1 , CFP2 CFP1 , YFP2 YFP1 , CFP2 3 . 0 3 . 0 N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc e n c e i n t en s i t y o f nea r e s t ne i gh bou r c e ll 2 . 5 2 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 5 Normalized fluorescence intensity of cell 1 . 0 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 0 Mature leaf CFP1 , YFP2 YFP1 , CFP2 pUBQ10 : 2xNLS - YFP pUBQ10 : 2xNLS - CFP a b c d e f g h i ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 02285 - 7 6 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 2132 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 02285 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications variance of the extrinsic noise to obtain a measure between 1 and − 1 for the correlation between neighbouring cells ( Supplementary Note 2 ) . In this way we estimated the correlation of the extrinsic noise between nearest neighbour cells in young leaves and found a weak but signi ﬁ cant correlation ( r = 0 . 34 , p < 0 . 0002 , rando - mization test , Fig . 5d ) . To test whether this correlation ceases with increased distances we calculated the correlation between each nucleus and its 39 closest neighbours . We observed a drastic reduction with increasing distance . To judge over how many cell diameters extrinsic ﬂ uctuations are correlated we determined the average nearest neighbour distance and used this value to de ﬁ ne ﬁ ve concentric rings ( tiers ) of cell distances ( Fig . 5e ) . These data indicate that on young leaves correlation is mainly found between immediately neighbouring cells . By contrast , we detected no correlation between neighbouring cells on mature leaves ( r = 0 . 02 , p = 0 . 433 , randomization test , Fig . 5f ) . Similar results were obtained with the second p35S : 2xNLS - YFP p35S : 2xNLS - CFP line ( r = 0 . 423 ; p = 0 . 0014 ; Supplementary Fig . 21 ) and with a pUBQ10 : 2xNLS - YFP pUBQ10 : 2xNLS - CFP line ( r = 0 . 413 ; p = 0 . 0003 , randomization test , Fig . 5g – i ) . Thus , correlation is only found in young but not in mature leaves ( see con ﬁ rmation in independent transformants in Supplementary Figure 21 ) . A dis - tance dependent correlation of extrinsic noise was also found in hypocotyl and root tissues for two independent p35S : 2xNLS - YFP p35S : 2xNLS - CFP lines ( Supplementary Fig . 22 , Supplementary Fig . 23 ) . To judge to what extent inheritance of mRNA and protein content can explain the observed next - neighbour correlation we used the two - stage gene expression model shown in Fig . 1 a under the following assumptions : At time t = 0 the mRNA and protein content of a mother cell expressing the dual reporter system is copied to two daughter cells . Thus daughter cells have identical initial condition for the mRNA and protein amount . Except for the translation rate the cells inherit all parameter values from the mother cell ( Fig . 5c ) . The translational rates of the daughter cells are stochastic and in general different from each other ( extrinsic noise ) . Given the observed division rate of Arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells and the degradation rate of the reporters we estimated the contribution of mRNA and protein inheritance to the next - neighbour correlation to be r ≈ 0 . 16 ( Supplementary Note 4 , Supplementary Fig . 25 ) . This indicates that the inheritance of mRNA and protein content is not suf ﬁ cient to explain the observed spatial correlation . To estimate the maximal correlation caused by inheritance we considered the case that not only the mRNA and protein content is inherited but also all rates related to gene expression ( i . e . , all rates of the daughter cells are identical and equal to the rates of the mother cell and do not change over time ) . In this case we found a correlation of r = 0 . 4 which is close to the experimentally observed value . Discussion As reported before in bacteria , yeast and animals we report in this manuscript ﬂ uctuations of gene expression in 3 h time intervals . Interestingly , a recent publication by Meyer et al . 6 , provided evidence that such a temporal ﬂ uctuation can be ﬁ xed and translated into different cell differentiation responses . The use of a dual reporter system enabled us to distinguish between extrinsic and intrinsic noise . Consistent with results in yeast 2 , 20 , 25 , we found that extrinsic noise is the major source of noisy gene expression in young and mature rosette leaves . This indicates that the physiological state of plant cells equally affecting expression of all genes creates more noise than the intrinsic stochasticity of molecular processes in ﬂ uencing tran - scription and translation . It is therefore conceivable that differ - ences of extrinsic noise in different cell types re ﬂ ects different physiological properties or states of the cell types . Consistent with this , our theoretical analysis of the spatial correlation suggests , that the inheritance of mRNA and proteins is not suf ﬁ cient to explain the spatial correlation and that the inheritance of cellular conditions ( e . g . , ribosome number , stress status ) and / or cell - cell communication is required . This explanation also ﬁ ts the ﬁ nding that we found no spatial correlation in mature leaves as both , cell division rates 30 and the number of open plasmodesmata ceases in mature tissues 31 . In this light , spatial coupling of extrinsic noise suggests that some processes needed for gene expression co - vary . One possible explanation is that tissues are composed of micro - domains with different physiological properties that lead , e . g . , to different numbers of accessible RNAs and / or ribosomes . Methods Construct generation . pENS - YFP GW ( Glyphosat R ) and pENS - CFP GW ( Gly - phosinat R ) were modi ﬁ ed by introducing the phosphorylated linker Sal I - SV40NLS - Xho I ( 5 ′ - CTCGAGATGCCAAAGAAGAAAAGAAAAGTTGAA - GATCCTGGGTCGAC - 3 ′ ) into the Xho I restriction site of the vectors . For gen - eration of pENS - 2xNLS - YFP GW and pENS - 2xNLS - CFP GW the ligation procedure was repeated and an additional SV40NLS was introduced into the Xho I site . In order to introduce a stop codon downstream of the YFP sequence an LR reaction ( Gateway ® cloning of system Invitrogen ) was performed with pENTR1A - ccdB 33 and the destination vectors . p35S : NLS - KikGR and pUBQ10 : NLS - KikGR were generated by LR reactions using pENTRA - NLS - KikGR and the pAMPAT plasmids . All constructs and their use in different experiments are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 .

Arabidopsis leaves were transiently transformed by particle bombardment using a particle gun ( gene gun ) . 0 . 8 µ g DNA of each construct were used and pipetted into one reaction tube . 10 μ l gold ( 30 mg / ml ; diameter 1 μ m ) , 20 μ l CaCl 2 2 . 5 M and 8 μ l spermidine 0 . 1M were added . After incubation for 10minutes at room temperature the gold suspension was centrifuged ( 10 s , 10 , 000 r . p . m . ) and the coated gold particles were resus - pended in 100 μ l 70 % EtOH . After a second centrifugation step ( 10 s , 10 , 000 r . p . m . ) 50 μ l absolute EtOH were added to the gold particle pellet . After resuspending the pellet , the suspension was centrifuged again ( 10 s , 10 , 000 r . p . m . ) . Finally , the gold particle pellet was resuspended in 15 μ l abs . EtOH and placed onto a plastic disc ( macro carrier ) . After drying , the macro carrier was placed into the particle gun and the gold particles were used for bombardment of leek cells . Rupture disks ( 900 psi ) and a vacuum of 26Hg ( inch of mercury , equivalent to 3 . 38 Pa at 0°C ) were applied during bombardments . After bombardment the samples were stored in darkness at room temperature and were analyzed 16 – 24 h after the transformation procedure . Stable transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana . 5ml pre - culture of agrobacteria containing the desired construct were grown over night . At the next day 200ml were inoculated with 500 µ l of the pre - culture . After ~ 24 h 10 g sucrose and 50 µ l Silwet L - 77 were added to the culture . Plant ﬂ owers were dipped into the sus - pension for 10 s . For double transformation 100 ml of each culture were mixed shortly before transformation as described previously 32 . 10 g and 50 µ l Silwet L - 77 were added and ﬂ owers were incubated in the suspension for 10 s . Confocal laser scanning microscopy . Confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) images were generated using Leica TCS SPE . Images were analyzed and quanti ﬁ ed using the software ImageJ . Mean grey values ( 0 = black ; 255 = white ) of regions of interest ( ROIs ) of 8 bit images were used for calculations . Analyses were always performed with overlaying maximum Z - stack projection images . Laser , gain , and detection parameters were never changed for all image acquisitions ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Measurement of photoconvertible NLS - KikGR . Single leaves ( leaf number 3 or 4 ) of 7 days old stably transformed p35S : NLS - KikGR and pUBQ10 : NLS - KikGR plants ( Col - 0 ) were imaged by CLSM ( Leica TCS SPE ) . The leaves were placed onto 1 % MS agar on a cover slip for imaging . NLS - KikG was photoconverted to NLS - KikR by a 405 nm laser line ( 100 % laser power ) exciting the sample for 5 to 10 s . NLS - KikR degradation and re - synthesized NLS - KikG were sequentially imaged two times at three different time points ( 0 , 3 , and 6 h ) with the de ﬁ ned Z - slide distance of 3 . 0 µ m . Each nucleus was manually selected from Z - stack projections ( 512px×512px ) of entire leaves to ﬁ nd the maximal cross - section . The boundary of the nucleus was always clearly seen independent of the ﬂ uorescence intensity . Subsequently , we determined the mean grey intensity of the selected region using ImageJ . Mean grey values of ROIs were used for calculation of protein degradation of NLS - KikR and protein synthesis of NLS - KikG . To test whether NLS - KikGR can move between cells , we transformed single Arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells by biolistic transformation with p35S : NLS - KikGR . Among 20 transformed cells we found not a single case where ﬂ uorescent signal could be detected in the neighbouring cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1d - e ) . Measurement of CFP and YFP ﬂ uorescence intensities . Stably transformed p35S : 2xNLS - YFP p35S : 2xNLS - CFP and pUBQ10 : 2xNLS - YFP pUBQ10 : 2xNLS - CFP plants ( Col - 0 ) were imaged by CLSM ( Leica TCS SPE ) . Laser , gain and detection parameters were never changed for all image acquisitions . CFP and YFP ﬂ uores - cence intensities were sequentially imaged with the de ﬁ ned Z - slide distance of 1 . 51 µ m . Nuclei were selected and analyzed as describe above . The mean background of each channel and image was measured separately and subtracted from the CFP and YFP mean grey values and the data were normalized using the mean ﬂ uorescence of the data set . For raw images see Supplementary Fig . 26 . Calculations of extrinsic and intrinsic noise were performed for each image separately and ﬁ nally all noise values of each image of the same tissue were presented in a box plot including the corresponding median and mean values . We excluded samples from the analysis in which the YFP and CFP value distributions were signi ﬁ cantly different in a Kolmogorov – Smirnov test to exclude that a skewing between the two channels in ﬂ uences our analysis . For all statistical analysis we con ﬁ rmed that the data structure is adequate . Each root tip was virtually rotated in the z – y axis to ensure a horizontal position of the root tip in the image . Only the upper 15 µ m layer was analyzed for calculations of noise to select only epidermal cells . Code availability .
