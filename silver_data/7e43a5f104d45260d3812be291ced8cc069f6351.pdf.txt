Thirty years after Cochrane’s reproach we feel it is timely to consider the extent to which health professionals , the public and policy - makers could now use ‘‘critical summa - ries’’ of trials for their decision - making . The Landscape Keeping up with information in health care has never been easy . Even in 1753 , when James Lind published his landmark review of what was then known about scurvy , he needed to point out that ‘‘… before the subject could be set in a clear and proper light , it was necessary to remove a great deal of rubbish’’ [ 2 ] . And 20 years later , Andrew Duncan launched a publication summarising research for cli - nicians , lamenting that critical information ‘‘…is scattered through a great number of volumes , many of which are so expensive , that they can be purchased for the libraries of public societies only , or of very wealthy individuals’’ [ 3 ] . We continue to live with these two problems—an overload of unfiltered information and lack of open access to information relevant to the well - being of patients . A century later , the precursor of the US National Library of Medicine ( NLM ) began indexing the medical literature . Between 1865 and 2006 , the index grew from 1 , 600 references to nearly 10 million [ 4 ] . Even with the assistance of electronic databases such as NLM’s MEDLINE , the problem of having to trawl through and sift vast amounts of data has grown . As mountains of unsynthesised research evi - dence accumulate , we need to keep improving our methods for gathering , filtering , and synthesising it . Some of the key events in the story so far are shown on the timeline in Figure 1 . A legal regulatory framework overseen by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) requiring proof of efficacy of new drugs was introduced in 1962 , and other countries followed suit . These develop - ments made it inevitable that randomised trials would increasingly become an im - portant component of the evidence base [ 5 ] . Government health technology assess - ment agencies were also established as policymakers sought to have more reliable evidence of the effects of other forms of health care interventions [ 6 ] . As the number of clinical trials grew , so too did the science of reviewing trials . Systematic reviews and meta - analyses endeavouring to make sense of multiple trials began to appear in a variety of health fields in the 1970s and 1980s ( see Box 1 ) . An important early example showed that postoperative radiotherapy after surgical treatment of breast cancer was associated with a previously unrecognised increased risk of death [ 7 ] . Another challenged beliefs about vitamin C and the common cold [ 8 ] . A third suggested a previously The Policy Forum allows health policy makers around the world to discuss challenges and opportunities for improving health care in their societies .

Summary Points N When Archie Cochrane reproached the medical profession for not having critical summaries of all randomised controlled trials , about 14 reports of trials were being published per day . There are now 75 trials , and 11 systematic reviews of trials , per day and a plateau in growth has not yet been reached . N Although trials , reviews , and health technology assessments have undoubtedly had major impacts , the staple of medical literature synthesis remains the non - systematic narrative review . Only a small minority of trial reports are being analysed in up - to - date systematic reviews . Given the constraints , Archie Cochrane’s vision will not be achieved without some serious changes in course . N To meet the needs of patients , clinicians , and policymakers , unnecessary trials need to be reduced , and systematic reviews need to be prioritised . Streamlining and innovation in methods of systematic reviewing are necessary to enable valid answers to be found for most patient questions . Finally , clinicians and patients require open access to these important resources .

By the mid - 1980s , the need to minimise the likelihood of being misled by the effects of biases and the play of chance in reviews of research evidence was being made evident in articles [ 10 – 14 ] and textbooks [ 15 ] . In 1988 , regularly updated electronic publication of systematic reviews and meta - analyses , along with bibliographies of randomised trials , began in the perina - tal field [ 16 , 17 ] . This provided a model for the inauguration of the international Cochrane Collaboration in 1993 to pre - pare , maintain , and disseminate systematic reviews of the effects of health care interventions . Where Are We Now ? Despite this progress , the task keeps increasing in size and complexity . We still do not know exactly how many trials have been done . For a variety of reasons , a large proportion of trials have remained unpub - lished [ 18 , 19 ] . Furthermore , many trials have been published in journals without being electronically indexed as trials , which makes them difficult to find . One of the first steps in being able to adequate - ly review literature is that scientific contributions which predate digitalised information systems and trial indexing need to be ‘‘rediscovered and inserted into the memory system’’ [ 20 ] . Through the 1990s , to identify possible reports of controlled trials , the Cochrane Collabora - tion mobilised thousands of volunteers around the globe to comb the major databases , and to hand - search nondigita - lised health literature , unpublished confer - ence proceedings , and books . The result of this collaborative effort is the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register ( CCTR ) ( now called the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ) . The differences between the numbers of trial records in MEDLINE and CCTR ( see Figure 2 ) have multiple causes . Both CCTR and MEDLINE often contain more than one record from a single study , and there are lags in adding new records to both databases . The NLM filters are probably not as efficient at excluding non - trials as are the methods used to compile CCTR . Furthermore , MEDLINE has more language restrictions than CCTR . In brief , there is still no single repository reliably showing the true number of randomised trials . Similar difficulties apply to trying to estimate the number of systematic reviews and health technology assessments ( HTAs ) . In Figures 2 and 3 we use a variety of data sources to estimate the numbers of trials and systematic reviews published from 1950 to the end of 2007 ( see Text S1 ) . The number of trials continues to rise : although the data from CCTR suggest some fluctu - ation in trial numbers in recent years , this may be misleading because the Cochrane Collaboration virtually halted additions to CCTR as it undertook a review and internal restructuring that lasted a couple of years .

With a median of perhaps 80 participants per trial , the number of people being enrolled in trials is likely to be more than 2 , 000 , 000 per year [ 21 ] . Prospective trial registration establishes a new genre of evidence repository : trials are registered in these databases at inception , theoretically enabling an overview of all published and unpublished trials . In 2004 , the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors ( ICMJE , http : / / www . icmje . org / ) announced that their journals would no longer publish trials that had not been prospectively registered [ 22 ] . Before this announcement , an average of 30 trials a week were being prospectively registered around the world . Once the journal editors’ deadline came into force , more than 200 ongoing trials per week were being registered [ 23 ] . In 2007 , the US Congress made detailed prospective trial registration legally man - datory [ 24 ] . As WHO’s international clinical trials platform develops , it will become possible to generate a more realistic picture of how many trials are being done . This registry draws together standardised core data from all the trial registries meeting specified quality criteria . Registering full protocols and reporting trial results in these registries are the next frontiers . How Close Are We to Archie Cochrane’s Goal ? In 1986 and 1987 , Goldschmidt and Mulrow showed how great the potential is for error in reviews of health literature that were not conducted systematically [ 9 , 10 ] . Looking at data such as those in Figure 3 could provide the comforting illusion that systematic reviews have displaced other less reliable forms of information . Howev - er , as Figure 4 shows , this is far from the case . The growth has been even more remarkable in non - systematic ( ‘‘narra - tive’’ ) reviews and case reports . Journal publishing of non - systematic reviews , and the emergence of many journals whose sole product is non - systematic reviews , has far outstripped the growth of systematic reviews and HTAs , as impressive as the latter has been . And the number of case reports—which can also provide impor - tant new information such as adverse effects—is far higher than the number of trials or systematic reviews . Trials , system - atic reviews , and HTAs have undoubtedly had major impacts , including on clinical guidelines : they are more likely to be cited and read than other study types [ 25 ] . However , the staple of medical literature synthesis remains the non - systematic nar - rative review . Furthermore , we are a long way from having all relevant trials incorporated into good systematic reviews . The workload involved in producing reviews is increas - ing , and the bulk of systematic reviews are now many years out of date [ 26 ] . The median number of trials contained within individual systematic reviews has been Figure 3 . The number of systematic reviews in health care , 1990 to 2007 . INAHTA is International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment ; the Montori systematic review filter is detailed in Text S1 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 1000326 . g003 PLoS Medicine | www . plosmedicine . org 4 September 2010 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e1000326 variously estimated at between six and 16 ( Cochrane reviews now include an average of over 12 trials per review [ 27 , 28 ] ; M Clarke , personal communication ) , but many reviews have covered much the same territory . Thus , in the 30 years since systematic reviews began in earnest , with around 15 years of intensified and large - scale reviewing effort , only a minority of trials have been assessed in systematic reviews . Given the triple constraint posed by the growth in trials , the increasing complexity of review methods , and current resources , Archie Cochrane’s vision will not be achieved without some serious changes in course—in particular , with a greater concentration on Cochrane’s use of the word ‘‘relevant’’ . Where to Now ? First , we need to prioritise effectively and reduce avoidable waste in the pro - duction and reporting of research evidence [ 29 ] . This has implications for trials as well as systematic reviews . Some funders and others will now not consider supporting a trial unless a systematic review has shown the trial to be necessary [ 30 ] . It is essential that this requirement be more widely adopted . And it is essential that reviews address questions that are relevant to patients , clinicians and policymakers . Second , we may need to choose be - tween elaborate reviews of a quarter of the questions clinicians and patients have or ‘‘leaner’’ reviews of most of what we want to know . The methodological standards for systematic reviewing have been in - creasing over time [ 28 ] , and the evolution of standards in the Cochrane Collabora - tion and in HTA has been remarkable . The increase in steps and reporting required is reflected in the length of reviews . Early Cochrane reviews could typically be printed out in 10 or 20 pages , even when they incorporated several trials . Today , it is not unusual for a review by a health technology agency to run to several hundred pages . Often the reviews are longer than the combined length of the reports of all the included trials . A contributing factor here is the in - creasing expectation for reviews to include study types other than randomised trials . This will often be essential for detecting less common adverse effects . However , the inclusion of all study types to answer all questions about the effects of treatments would not necessarily provide better quality information in every instance – while it would unquestionably increase the time and resource requirement for re - views . While it is vital that reviews are scientifically defensible , burdening those preparing them with excessive require - ments could result in having valid answers to relatively few questions . In particular , we need leaner and more efficient methods of staying up - to - date with the evidence . Using current methods , the Cochrane Collaboration has not been able to keep even half of its reviews up - to - date [ 31 ] , and other organisations are in a similar predicament [ 32 ] . We need to develop innovative methods to reduce the labour of updating , and provide what clinicians and patients need : an assurance that a conclusion is not out of date , even if not every later trial is included within every analysis . It is also the responsibility of reviewer authors and journal editors to ensure that every new systematic review places itself clearly in context of other Figure 4 . The rise in non - systematic reviews , case reports , trials , and systematic reviews , 1950 to 2007 ( as identified in MEDLINE ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 1000326 . g004 PLoS Medicine | www . plosmedicine . org 5 September 2010 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e1000326 systematic reviews and HTAs . It will be to little avail to the average clinician , patient , and information provider , however , if the resulting knowledge is not comprehensible and openly accessible . Finally , although more funding for evaluative clinical research internationally remains a priority , more international collaboration could result in better use being made of resources for systematic reviewing and HTAs . While multiple reviews on topics can provide a rounded picture of an area as well as a de facto form of updating when the reviews are conducted several years apart , there is also considerable duplication of review effort . In November 2009 , an international meeting in Cologne formed a new collab - oration called ‘‘KEEP Up , ’’ which will aim to harmonise updating standards and aggregate updating results . This should reduce the workload and enable organisa - tions to be alerted when there are important shifts in evidence . Initiated and coordinated by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care ( IQWiG ) and involving key systematic reviewing and guidelines organisations such as the Cochrane Collaboration , Duodecim , the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ( SIGN ) , and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) , this effort will provide a platform for tackling practical and methodological issues involved in keeping up - to - date . There is nevertheless a risk that the increasing burdens placed on the methods of systematic reviewing could make the goal of keeping up - to - date with the knowledge won from trials recede ever more quickly into the distance . Perhaps one of the first questions we should ask whenever an additional process or more demanding methodology for systematic reviewing is proposed is this : Will this development serve or hinder our ability to better understand and communicate enough results from trials ? In 1979 , when Archie Cochrane argued that we needed critical summaries to keep up with the crucial knowledge those trials were gener - ating , there were perhaps 14 trials a day being published . Thirty years later , it would be just as hard to keep up with the systematic reviews . Every day there are now 11 systematic reviews and 75 trials , and there are no signs of this slowing down : but there are still only 24 hours in a day .
