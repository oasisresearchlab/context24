To support people’s creative thinking processes while searching for academic information , we developed SearchIdea , a Web - based online tool , that enables users to actively interact with search results beyond evaluation and selection . Through its three primary features – search - results , SearchMapper , and IdeaMapper – SearchIdea allows users to add saved search results to SearchMapper for comparison , prioritization , and rearrangement . Using IdeaMap - per , users can elicit keywords from search results , brainstorm , and organize ideas while identifying relationships among ideas . We also developed a baseline tool , IdeaPad , which provides users with a simple pad for writing and editing text . We then conducted an eval - uation study with 58 students at a university in the United States . The study subjects were assigned to either SearchIdea or IdeaPad and performed two search tasks : ( 1 ) generating as many ideas as possible , and ( 2 ) selecting the best idea after generating multiple ideas . The results showed that subjects using SearchIdea entered more unique search terms , generated longer queries , and engaged with search results more actively than those who used IdeaPad . The SearchIdea users reported higher ratings for idea generation in terms of synthesizing and organizing ideas than did the IdeaPad users . The findings of our study provide insights into how an idea generation tool can connect search activities with creative thinking processes in order to generate more and better ideas .

However , searching for infor - mation for academic purposes is challenging as it requires tasks such as comprehending long documents , analyzing key points , and synthesizing complex concepts [ 13 ] . Furthermore , searching for information to generate ideas involves user goals and intents such as learning the topic space [ 44 ] , finding multiple perspectives on the topic [ 13 ] , and seeking inspiration and examples of ideas [ 76 ] . During the search process , users may need to track the ideas they have found and to organize those ideas to stimulate their creative thinking processes [ 13 ] . Thus , supporting idea generation during academic search tasks maximizes the value of the information - seeking process towards creativity . Our work focuses on the cognitive dimension of creativity – the generation of ideas – in the academic search process . Creativity , which refers to the tendency to generate novel and useful ideas or products [ 56 ] , is a multifaceted and complex concept . For example , creativity has been proposed to occur in a spectrum , such as the categorization of creativity into four levels in the “Four C” model of creativity [ 30 ] ( i . e . , mini - c associated with learning , little - c occur - ring in completing everyday life activities , Pro - c in professional life tasks and Big - C for eminent creativity ) . We conceptualize creativity as the generation of novel and meaningful ideas by ordinary people in everyday life activities – everyday creativity [ 51 ] . Current search engines work effectively for search tasks that seek to find factual information and remember knowledge . However , search engines seem to provide limited support for idea generation [ 41 , 52 ] . Previous studies have demonstrated how to support cre - ativity during the search process , such as by supplying diverse per - spectives in news articles [ 39 ] , stimulating presentation of search results [ 31 ] , and suggesting query terms [ 45 ] . What distinguishes this study from previous studies on creativity is its focus on sup - porting idea generation during searches for academic tasks . More specifically , we incorporated interactive visual features in the search interface to support ideation and tracking of search results in order to support users’ idea generation during academic search tasks . Our study investigates how we can support idea generation dur - ing the search process by providing an interactive visual tool that facilitates prioritizing search results , directly eliciting keywords and ideas , and organizing ideas . Findings from previous studies support the use of visual tools in learning [ 20 , 26 , 69 ] . For example , 161 CHIIR ’23 , March 19 – 23 , 2023 , Austin , TX , USA Catherine Chavula , Yujin Choi , and Soo Young Rieh concept mapping has been shown to foster “meaningful learning” – i . e . , a deep understanding of complex new concepts that facilitates formation of relationships with prior knowledge [ 26 ] . Buzan and Buzan [ 11 ] have suggested that the use of mind mapping improves recall of information , facilitates identification of relationships be - tween topics , and encourages planning , organizing , reflecting on ideas , and brainstorming . Accordingly , mind mapping can be used as a tool for two critical thought processes : divergent thinking ( generation of as many ideas as possible [ 23 , 55 ] ) and convergent thinking ( selection of the best ideas [ 23 , 55 ] ) . To this end , we have developed SearchIdea ( Figure 1 and Fig - ure 2 ) , a Web - based online tool , to support users to generate and organize ideas during searching for academic tasks . SearchIdea has three interface components : a search - results page that allows users to interact with search results actively beyond evaluation and selection ; the SearchMapper on which users can place their favorite search results and rearrange the order of search results ; and the IdeaMapper through which users can create a mind map to elicit words and phrases from the search results , add new words and phrases of the user’s own choosing , and organize their ideas vi - sually . We also developed a baseline tool , IdeaPad ( Figure 3 ) , which has a text editor placed on the right side of the search results page , providing users with a simple pad for writing and editing text . In this paper , we introduce the SearchIdea features and present the findings from a remote - user evaluation study . To evaluate SearchIdea , we recruited 60 undergraduate and graduate students at a university in the United States and analyzed data from 58 subjects . The research design was a combination of between - subjects ( ei - ther SearchIdea or IdeaPad ) and within - subjects ( same two search tasks ) . Our evaluation focused on assessing how SearchIdea fea - tures impacted users’ convergent and divergent thinking , querying behavior , and interaction with search results during the completion of the two academic tasks . Specifically , we address the following three research questions : RQ1 AretheredifferencesinsearchinteractionsbetweenSearchIdeausersandIdeaPadusers ? RQ2 How does the use of a tool ( SearchIdea vs . IdeaPad ) affect users’ perceived relationship between search activities and idea generation ? RQ3 Are there differences in the extent of creativity support for searching between SearchIdea users and IdeaPad users ? 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 The Nature of Creativity Creativity is widely known as a complex and multi - dimensional phenomenon , with its meaning derived from the context in which it occurs [ 59 ] . Several frameworks have been developed to under - stand creativity . In particular , Rhodes [ 50 ] presented the four - Ps model , which consists of four perspectives on creativity : person , process , product , and press . The person perspective investigates the characteristics and traits of the creative person ; the process per - spective is concerned with the mental processes and the process phases associated with creativity ; the product perspective investi - gates the outcomes and qualities of the creative products ; and the press perspective is concerned with the external factors or environ - ment in which creativity occurs . Simonton [ 66 ] has subsequently extended the model by adding persuasion . Further , Runco [ 54 ] in - troduced a classification of the perspectives into two categories : creative potential ( person , press , and process ) and creative perfor - mance ( product and persuasion ) . The four - Ps framework provides constructs for operationalizing the assessment of creativity from multiple perspectives . Related to our work , several process theories including Wallas’s four - stage model [ 73 ] , Amabile’s componen - tial model [ 2 , 3 ] , and Sawyer’s eight - stage model [ 59 ] incorporate the gathering of information in their initial phases of the creative process [ 3 , 59 , 73 ] . Additionally , several studies on creativity have emphasized the importance of knowledge in creative performance [ 42 , 57 , 68 , 74 ] . Another framework for conceptualizing creativity is the four - Cs creativity framework – Big - C , Pro - c , little - c , and mini - c – proposed by Kaufman and Beghetto [ 30 ] . Kaufman and Beghetto [ 30 ] claimed that creativity occurs in a spectrum spanning from cre - ativity occurrences in learning contexts of everyday life activities – everyday creativity [ 51 ] , to eminent creativity [ 67 ] . In essence , the four - Cs model presumes that everyone can be creative [ 30 ] and thus provides the framework to investigate creativity involving anyone in any context . 2 . 2 Creativity Support Tools A creativity support tool ( CST ) supports users in one or more phases of the creative process [ 22 ] . Examples of such tools are those that support ideation activities such as brainstorming [ 5 – 7 , 19 , 24 , 25 , 27 , 32 ] . Research on how people use search tools to support their creative work show that tools are influenced by the creative process stage [ 37 , 75 ] . For example , people who are in the look - up phase of the creative process are likely to use search systems to support their work [ 75 ] . Likewise , Shneiderman illus - trated searching and browsing digital libraries as an initial phase of the creative process involving digital tools [ 60 , 61 ] . Correspond - ingly , conceptual frameworks for information seeking [ 36 , 64 ] and searching [ 13 ] and information behaviors [ 40 ] for creative work have highlighted the need to adapt search systems to foster cre - ativity . For example , users struggle to formulate queries for their creative work as such tasks involve exploration and discovery of new ideas , and in many cases the information need is not clearly de - fined [ 34 , 44 , 71 ] . From this viewpoint , the key attributes of search systems that support creativity have been proposed to include sup - port for exploratory search , organization , and visualization of ideas [ 8 , 10 , 34 , 61 ] . 2 . 2 . 1 Creativity Support Search Tools . A few studies have inves - tigated the adaptation of search systems to support creative tasks through exploration of information [ 31 ] and discovery of idea as - sociations [ 31 , 39 , 65 ] . Kerne et al . [ 31 ] developed combinForma - tion , a tool for supporting search tasks that involves finding ideas by using mixed initiative to retrieve and present results as visual compositions of text and images . The evaluation of the tool in an undergraduate design course to come up with prior work and new inventions showed that students who used the tool scored higher than those who used a generic search engine and word processor . Another tool , Inject [ 39 ] , was developed to help journalists find new ideas through the presentation of information such as data and evidence , background information , data and information vi - sualization , cartoons , and named entities related to a search term . 162 SearchIdea : An Idea Generation Tool to Support Creativity in Academic Search CHIIR ’23 , March 19 – 23 , 2023 , Austin , TX , USA The evaluation of the tool in three newsrooms showed that stories written using Inject had higher degrees of novelty when compared to stories written without the tool . Siemon and Robra - Bissantz [ [ 65 ] developed a tool to support divergent thinking by suggesting query terms from a description of an idea submitted by a user . In the same way , studies have explored the adaptation of the retrieval algorithms to enhance creativity [ 38 , 48 , 72 ] . For example , Lu and Chang [ 38 ] implemented a ranking algorithm for video recommen - dation based on Bayesian Surprise . Raczinski et al . [ 48 ] presented the use of petaphysics as a method for generating surprising and diverse search results . 2 . 2 . 2 Tools to Support Exploratory Search . Related search tools to support exploratory search have been developed [ 4 , 16 , 28 , 29 , 35 ] . CoNotate [ 45 ] supports users by providing query suggestions generated from the analysis of a searcher’s notes , previous search patterns , and information gaps . The results of the evaluation of CoNotate showed that subjects who used the tool submitted more queries and discovered more terms than those who used the baseline . OrgBox [ 15 , 17 ] is a tool designed to help users externalize their mental representation of a complex domain they are exploring using flexible notes—organizing boxes incorporated in the search engine results pages . The evaluation of OrgBox showed better support for metacognitive activities such as monitoring , evaluation , and planning . 2 . 2 . 3 Search Tools to Support Learning . Learning is an essential component of the creative process [ 30 , 34 ] . Active learning tools integrated with search systems have been investigated with respect to the framework of search as learning ( SAL ) , which focuses on fostering learning experiences and improving learning outcomes through search activities [ 18 , 52 ] . Câmara et al . [ 12 ] investigated the use of conceptual scaffolds or topical outlines to help users prioritize important topics for their learning . The results of the evaluation showed no gains in learning but did show changes in search behavior . Similar results were reported for a study that investigated integrating active reading tools , such as highlighting and note - taking in search systems [ 53 ] . IdeaKeeper [ 46 , 47 ] was developed to help learners explore a digital library with tools that would allow them to read , skim , and summarize articles using the incorporated scaffolded notepads with questions about the information they were reading . 2 . 3 Evaluation of Creativity Support Tools The evaluation of creativity remains a widely discussed topic due to the diverse theories about creativity . The most common approach in the creative process perspective is to assess divergent thinking , which has been found to be a strong predictor of creativity [ 55 ] . Examples of tests for divergent thinking include Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking ( TTCT ) [ 70 ] . In the product perspective , the out - come of the creative process is usually assessed by having experts evaluate a product ( i . e . , creative performance ) [ 1 ] . However , evalu - ation of products may not be plausible for all products , especially those in experimental settings . More recently , automated methods have been developed for evaluating creative work products , such as using idea density for written verbal content [ 58 ] and semantic networks [ 9 ] for assessing idea relatedness . Conversely , the evaluation of CSTs is not a widely investigated topic [ 49 , 62 , 63 ] due to the lack of applicable evaluative metrics , which are comparable to productivity tools [ 49 , 63 ] . Cherry and Latulipe [ 14 ] developed the Creativity Support Index ( CSI ) , a sur - vey instrument that can be administered to evaluate the digital CSTs support of the creative process . However , the use of CSI re - mains a challenge due to the category of collaboration , which is not present in many CSTs . Kerne et al . [ 33 ] proposed metrics for evaluating information - based ideation tasks at two levels : first , met - rics for evaluating creativity within the digital objects—elemental ideational metrics ( i . e . , fluency , flexibility , and novelty ) ; and second , holistic ideation metrics for evaluating how the curated objects were combined ( i . e . , emergence , relevance , and visual presentation ) . The evaluation of search tools that support creativity poses new challenges for CST evaluation in terms of evaluating the effective - ness of search tools beyond relevance of search results , usefulness , user engagement , and other measures . 3 SEARCH TOOLS FOR SUPPORTING CREATIVITY The purpose of SearchIdea was to enable users to visually repre - sent ideas , consider perspectives from multiple angles ( i . e . , use lateral thinking ) , and establish associations among ideas , which can foster divergent thinking . Further , users may use SearchIdea to group ideas using the coloring feature , which enables them to compare , evaluate , and select the best ideas ( e . g . , supporting con - vergent thinking ) . We also developed IdeaPad , a text editor , as the baseline tool . In the following section , we present the core features of SearchIdea ( see Figure 1 and Figure 2 ) and IdeaPad ( see Figure 3 ) , highlighting the interface features for supporting idea generation . 3 . 1 Search Tool SearchIdea and IdeaPad both used Bing API to retrieve search results from the three digital libraries : Directory of Open Access Journals ( DOAJ ) , JSTOR , and arXiv . We used four criteria to select these digital libraries : full - text availability , currency , and quality of the resources as well as overall reputation of the digital library . To interact with the search tool , a user enters a query through a search box and a ranked list of search results is returned . When the user clicks on the search results , the source page opens in a new page outside of SearchIdea or IdeaPad . 3 . 2 SearchIdea SearchIdea is a Web - based search tool , implemented as a Model , View , and Controller ( MVC ) application using the Python Django framework . The front end is implemented using React JS and node . js . SearchIdea consists of three main interface features : the search - results , SearchMapper , and IdeaMapper . 3 . 2 . 1 SearchMapper . SearchMapper holds search results that the user has selected to interact with further . The user adds selected search results to SearchMapper by clicking on a plus ( + ) button located next to each result . The user can rearrange selected search results to develop ideas or gain new insights . Additionally , users can delete search results from SearchMapper . SearchMapper can be 163 CHIIR ’23 , March 19 – 23 , 2023 , Austin , TX , USA Catherine Chavula , Yujin Choi , and Soo Young Rieh Figure 1 : Two SearchIdea features : search - results interface ( left ) and SearchMapper ( right ) . Note features for saving search results ( + sign ) , rearranging selected results , and delet - ing selected results in SearchMapper . Figure 2 : SearchMapper and IdeaMapper with an example mind map . Note the coloring of the nodes and a menu for adding nodes in the mind map . accessed in two pages of the application , which is located either to the right of the list of search results or to the left of IdeaMapper . 3 . 2 . 2 IdeaMapper . To further facilitate idea generation , we imple - mented a mind - mapping idea - visualization feature called IdeaMap - per , which enables users to brainstorm ideas , establish relationships among ideas , and group ideas . IdeaMapper consists of a working area where users can create their mind map and a menu with a col - lection of commands ( icons ) used to add ideas . Creating a mind map starts with adding the central idea in the middle and then adding secondary ideas to the central idea and more ideas to emanating ideas . Users can add ideas directly from search results by clicking on saved search result components such as a search result title or snippet in the SearchMapper . Alternatively , users can add ideas by using a menu that provides options for adding text , links , and image icons . Users can also form associations of ideas by adding connecting lines between ideas . Users can edit the text of an idea Figure 3 : IdeaPad with the two main features : List of search results and a text editor . Note various text - formatting fea - tures . and add connecting lines to change the relationship between ideas . IdeaMapper enables users to create colorful mind maps by allowing them to add color and images to their ideas . Finally , users can delete ideas , text , or lines in IdeaMapper at any time by selecting the com - ponent and pressing on a delete key . IdeaMapper is implemented using the React Flow Library . 3 . 3 IdeaPad Our study used a standard search results page interface and a text editor as a baseline tool that we called IdeaPad . We hypothesized that using an editor would allow people to take notes and keep track of their ideas , but would support only linear thinking ( i . e . , step - by - step process to generate ideas ) . Related studies [ 13 , 17 , 31 ] have used custom search engine and word processor combinations as a baseline tool . Additionally , previous studies on tools used in completing creative search tasks have found that a combination of a search tool and a note - taking tool such as a text editor are used in academic tasks [ 13 ] . In IdeaPad , the search feature provides users with a ranked list of search results similar to SearchIdea . Addition - ally , a text editor is placed to the right side of the search results page interface to allow users to take notes or add ideas from their searches . Editing features include basic visual formatting features , such as bullet - list formatting and text alignment and indentation . Users can add text by either typing directly or copying and pasting . 4 METHODS 4 . 1 Research Design and Protocols We conducted an evaluation study with users combining between - subjects ( SearchIdea vs . IdeaPad ) and within - subjects ( all subjects were asked to generate many ideas for one topic and a best idea for another topic ) research design . The study was conducted remotely using Zoom video conferencing software to schedule a session with each study subject individually . Each session began with assigning a subject to one of the tools based on their subject number : odd - numbered subjects were assigned to SearchIdea and even - numbered subjects were assigned to IdeaPad . All study subjects completed two search tasks . Each session lasted approximately 1 . 5 hours . The protocols were as follows : 164 SearchIdea : An Idea Generation Tool to Support Creativity in Academic Search CHIIR ’23 , March 19 – 23 , 2023 , Austin , TX , USA ( 1 ) subjects watch either the SearchIdea tutorial video ( 2 min - utes 44 seconds ) or the IdeaPad tutorial video ( 1 minute 15 seconds ) . ( 2 ) subjects complete the background questionnaire ( 3 ) the first task descriptions are introduced ( 4 ) subjects complete the pre - task questionnaire subjects con - duct the search task for 20 minutes while thinking aloud ( 5 ) subjects complete the post - task questionnaire ( 6 ) subjects repeat steps ( 3 ) – ( 6 ) for the second task ( 7 ) subjects complete the post - system questionnaire ( 8 ) subjects participate in the exit interview Although subjects were given twenty minutes to perform each task , they were allowed to continue to search for an extra few minutes if they wanted . Subjects received an Amazon eGift card worth $ 30 for their participation in the study . 4 . 2 Tasks All study subjects were instructed to complete two tasks : one about “droughts , ” which was selected as a global current - event topic , and one about “sleep deprivation , ” which was selected as a common topic among college students . For the drought topic , subjects were instructed to generate as many ideas as possible from their search . We designed this task to examine subjects’ divergent thinking , en - couraging them to produce many creative ideas or solutions to a problem . For the sleep deprivation topic , subjects were instructed to select the best idea after generating multiple ideas from search - ing . Contrary to the first task , this task was related to convergent thinking , which seeks the best idea for a problem . Subjects were also informed that the tool they would be using offered only open - access scholarly journals , databases , and repositories , and therefore the search results would be different from the general search en - gine results . We counterbalanced the order of the tasks to mitigate learning effects . The task descriptions given to the subjects were as follows : • Drought Task : We are experiencing unprecedented levels of droughts nowadays . Imagine that you are required to write a term paper on different solutions for current drought problems . You were asked to report as many creative ideas as possible for your paper . • Sleep Deprivation Task : Research shows that sleep depriva - tion affects college students’ academic achievement . For a class you take , there will be class discussions on this topic . You want to come up with creative ideas to explain what causes this issue based on searching . What you need to do is to select the best idea after generating multiple ideas from searching on the tool that we provide . 4 . 3 Data Collection The data were collected from multiple sources , combining system interaction logs , background questionnaires , pre - and post - task questionnaires , post - system questionnaires , think - aloud recordings while performing the tasks , and exit interviews . 4 . 3 . 1 Search Interaction Measures . Both SearchIdea and IdeaPad logged search interaction data by collecting query - related logs ( features of queries submitted for each task ) , search results interac - tion data ( features of subjects’ interaction with search results ) , and SearchIdea features’ usage ( frequency of feature usage ) according to the following measures : ( 1 ) Number of queries : The number of queries submitted by the subject for each task . ( 2 ) Number of query terms : The average number of terms sub - mitted in a query for each task . ( 3 ) Query - term diversity : The number of query terms that were not issued by other subjects for a given task . ( 4 ) Query - term additions : Number of query terms that were not submitted by the subject in the pre - task questionnaire before starting to search for a given task . ( 5 ) Average time between clicks ( seconds ) : Average time between clicks on search results for a given query . ( 6 ) Average number of clicked documents : The number of clicked search results for a given query . 4 . 3 . 2 Questionnaires . Unless otherwise noted , all questionnaire items indicated subjects’ level of agreement with statements using a 5 - point Likert scale from 1 ( not at all ) to 5 ( a great deal ) . Before starting the task , subjects were asked background questions includ - ing academic status , familiarity with existing online brainstorming tools and organization tools , behavior during searching for new ideas , confidence in creativity , age , gender , and race . The pre - task questionnaire included nine items covering subjects’ perceptions of their interest and familiarity with the task , task complexity , task difficulty , creative self - belief , and an open - ended question of three search keywords that subjects planned to use for the task . The post - task questionnaire had 12 items related to subjects’ interests in the topic , prior knowledge of the topic , contributions of search to idea generation , task complexity , task difficulty , satisfaction with tool use , and creative self - belief . The post - system questionnaire included perceived usefulness ( five items ) , creativity support ( ten items ) , and usability ( five items ) questions . The creativity support questions were adapted from the creativity support index ( CSI ) [ 14 ] , which provided ratings of six dimensions of creativity sup - port : enjoyment , exploration , expressiveness , immersion , results worth effort , and collaboration . Out of the six dimensions , we ex - cluded collaboration questions because our tools were not intended to facilitate collaborative activities . 4 . 4 Data Analysis We conducted quantitative data analysis on logged system inter - action and subjects’ responses to the background , pre / post - task , and post - system questionnaires . Python3 and SPSS v . 28 were used for quantitative analysis . To investigate differences in search be - havior between SearchIdea users and IdeaPad users , we compared the means of proxies indicating search interaction with respect to tasks and tools : influence of SearchIdea features on queries , search results interaction , and search results engagement . We also ana - lyzed the differences between study subjects’ perceived relationship between search activities and idea generation . We conducted t - tests to compare the means of responses from the pre - task questionnaire ( individual interest in the task , task familiarity , task complexity , and task difficulty ) and post - task questionnaire ( interest , knowledge increase , searching contribution to idea generation , task complexity , 165 CHIIR ’23 , March 19 – 23 , 2023 , Austin , TX , USA Catherine Chavula , Yujin Choi , and Soo Young Rieh task difficulty , and satisfaction of each tool ) . Further , we conducted correlation analyses to investigate the strength of the relationships between measures in the post - task questionnaire . Lastly , to evaluate SearchIdea’s creativity support , we compared the means and con - ducted t - tests using responses from the post - system questionnaire . 5 RESULTS 5 . 1 Characteristics of subjects A total of 58 subjects were included in the data analysis out of 60 volunteers recruited from a university in the United States . The re - cruitment was made through the university’s departmental official mailing lists and a social media platform devoted to the university community . The subjects included undergraduate ( 𝑛 = 28 ) and grad - uate students ( 𝑛 = 30 ) from nine colleges in the university : informa - tion studies , business , education , engineering , liberal arts , natural science , law , pharmacy , and social work . Subjects self - reported their gender : male ( 𝑛 = 15 ) , female ( n = 42 ) , and non - binary ( 𝑛 = 1 ) . All subjects were between the ages of 18 and 45 : 18 – 25 ( 𝑛 = 39 ) , 26 – 35 ( 𝑛 = 17 ) and 36 – 45 ( 𝑛 = 2 ) . 5 . 2 Search Interaction RQ1 investigated whether there were differences in search inter - action between SearchIdea users and IdeaPad users in terms of querying behavior and interacting with search results . 5 . 2 . 1 Influence of SearchIdea Features on Queries . As shown in Table 1 , queries submitted by subjects using SearchIdea were longer ( 𝑀 𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎 ( 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 ) = 3 . 66 , 𝑀 𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎 ( 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 ) = 4 . 87 ) than those submitted by subjects using IdeaPad ( 𝑀 𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑃𝑎𝑑 ( 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 ) = 3 . 00 , 𝑀 𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑃𝑎𝑑 ( 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 ) = 4 . 11 ) Statistical tests showed that the results were significantly different ( 𝑡 ( 56 ) = 4 . 26 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 , Cohen’s 𝑑 = 0 . 42 for the drought task and 𝑡 ( 56 ) = 4 . 48 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 , Cohen’s 𝑑 = 0 . 40 for the sleep task ) . Subjects using SearchIdea submitted more queries than those using IdeaPad , although no significant differences were found . Subjects using SearchIdea also submitted more diverse terms ( on average about two more terms ) in their queries when completing the tasks than did those who used IdeaPad . Statistical tests showed that these differences were not significant . There was no significant difference on the number of clicked search results between SearchIdea users and IdeaPad users , with both groups clicking on at least two documents per query . Subjects who used SearchIdea submitted more unique terms than they had planned before starting the search ( query - term additions ) . These results suggest that subjects who used SearchIdea discovered more new terms as they generated longer queries with more diverse terms . This could indicate that SearchIdea supported subjects to deeply engage with search results because of the discovery and use of more terms in their queries . Finally , subjects spent , on average , more time between clicks when using SearchIdea than IdeaPad , but statistically significant differences were detected for the sleep deprivation task only with an effect size of 0 . 57 ( See Table 1 ) . This suggests that subjects using SearchIdea spent more time interacting with the search results , and may explain the reason they used more unique terms in their queries as they actively engaged more with the results . 5 . 2 . 2 Influence of SearchIdea Features on Search Results Interaction . Subjects using SearchIdea interacted with the search system and search results more actively ( see Table 2 ) . For example , subjects us - ing SearchIdea saved on average eight search results per task using the SearchMapper ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 9 . 00 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 7 . 21 ) . Subjects deleted at least two search results from the SearchMapper . Also , sub - jects moved between the SearchMapper and IdeaMapper at least five times . Subjects entered at least three ideas in the IdeaMapper not directly from the SearchMapper . Moreover , subjects entered at least ten ideas for each task . Unsurprisingly , subjects generated slightly more ideas for the divergent task ( drought ) ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 12 . 83 ) than the convergent thinking task ( 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 10 . 47 ) . Subjects did not actively use the feature for rearranging the rank of saved search results with an overall average of 0 . 45 . However , search interactions using SearchIdea features for subjects completing the drought and sleep deprivation tasks were not significantly different . Overall , the analysis showed that SearchIdea features encouraged subjects to be more engaged in their interaction with the system . Further , some interesting search interaction patterns were observed when subjects completed search tasks using either SearchIdea or IdeaPad . Subjects using SearchIdea came up with terms or selected information items such as images or URLs when they were adding their ideas in the IdeaMapper , while subjects who used IdeaPad simply copied text from the list of search results into the text editor . Unsurprisingly , subjects who used IdeaPad saved more words than those who used SearchIdea , but the former also used less unique terms in their queries . In summary , these results indicate that sub - jects using SearchIdea spent more time and effort searching for information and engaging with search results more actively . This might have led to discovering more unique terms , which is likely to encourage further generation of new ideas . 5 . 3 Perception of Relationships between Search Activities and Idea Generation To address RQ2 , we investigated how using a search tool ( SearchIdea vs . IdeaPad ) affected subjects’ perception of the relationship be - tween their search activities and idea generation . 5 . 3 . 1 Pre - Task Perceptions . We first conducted an analysis of the pre - task questionnaire responses to find out if there were any dif - ferences between the divergent ( drought ) and convergent ( sleep deprivation ) tasks . Subjects had interest on both topics to some degree ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 3 . 14 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 3 . 43 ) . Subjects’ familiar - ity with the topic of the tasks was low , although familiarity with sleep deprivation was slightly higher in terms of prior experience searching on the topic ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 1 . 38 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 2 . 22 ) and ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 1 . 66 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 2 . 60 ) for prior knowledge . Subjects indicated that they were less certain about the kind of information to look for with regard to the drought task ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 2 . 64 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 3 . 19 ) but they were to some extent certain about what to do for both tasks ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 3 . 36 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 3 . 64 ) . Also , subjects perceived both tasks to be slightly difficult to search for in - formation ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 2 . 69 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 2 . 47 ) . Similar perceptions were observed for difficulty in generating ideas ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 2 . 93 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 2 . 45 ) . Despite the slight differences in the perceptions of subjects before completing the task , there was no significant 166 SearchIdea : An Idea Generation Tool to Support Creativity in Academic Search CHIIR ’23 , March 19 – 23 , 2023 , Austin , TX , USA Table 1 : Means ( and standard deviations ) for search behaviour measures for SearchIdea and the IdeaPad .

Table 3 provides a summary of analy - sis of post - task perceptions for subjects who used either SearchIdea and IdeaPad for both tasks . Subjects reported knowledge increase to some degree ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 2 . 88 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 3 . 16 ) . In terms of the contribution of searching towards idea generation , subjects indicated that searching contributed moderately to their ideas ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 4 . 04 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 3 . 95 ) . Subjects indicated that they moderately considered multiple aspects when they were complet - ing the task ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 3 . 69 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 3 . 78 ) . Similar results were observed for taking multiple steps ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 3 . 90 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 3 . 72 ) . Further , subjects indicated that they wished to have more time ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 3 . 29 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 2 . 98 ) . In terms of task difficulty , subjects’ perceptions for the drought task were higher than those for the sleep deprivation task : difficulty for searching ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 3 . 12 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 2 . 40 ) , and difficulty for generat - ing ideas ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 3 . 14 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 2 . 31 ) . Likewise , subjects were slightly more satisfied with the sleep deprivation task than with the drought task : feeling of accomplishment ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 3 . 04 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 3 . 50 ) and satisfaction with new ideas generated ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 3 . 12 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 3 . 55 ) . There was a slight drop in interest for the drought task and slight increase in the sleep de - privation task ( 𝑀 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 2 . 97 and 𝑀 𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 = 3 . 74 ) . However , there were no significant differences among the post - task perception variables when comparing tasks that were completed using either SearchIdea or IdeaPad , except for generation of ideas and difficulty on searching for the drought task and contribution of searching to idea generation for the sleep deprivation task . Overall , our results suggest that subjects found the drought task slightly more complex and difficult and were less satisfied with their accomplishment and idea generation . We conducted correlation analyses to examine the relationships among the variables used in the post - task questionnaire using Pear - son coefficient of correlation ( see Figure 4 ) . Our results show mul - tiple relationships among the post - task subject perceptions . Sub - jects’ perception between their feeling of accomplishment was highly correlated with their satisfaction with the new ideas they generated ( 𝑟 = 0 . 75 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . The correlations of the two vari - ables of complexity were significant : taking multiple steps and considering multiple aspects ( 𝑟 = 0 . 54 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . Similar rela - tionships were found between difficulty in idea generation and difficulty in searching ( 𝑟 = 0 . 63 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . Results indicated an inverse relationship between interest and difficulty searching ( 𝑟 = − 0 . 31 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) and interest and difficulty in generating ideas ( 𝑟 = − 0 . 36 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . A similar relationship was observed for difficulty in generating ideas and feeling of accomplishment ( 𝑟 = − 0 . 5 , 𝑝 < . 001 ) and difficulty in generating ideas and satisfac - tion with new ideas generated ( 𝑟 = − 0 . 45 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . Knowledge increase was consistently associated with perceptions that search - ing contributed new ideas ( 𝑟 = 0 . 46 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) and feeling of accomplishment ( 𝑟 = 0 . 45 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . In general , our results in - dicated that subjects who perceived that they had gained some knowledge also thought that searching contributed to their ideas , and overall , were more interested in the task and more satisfied . Likewise , subjects who had lower interest perceived that searching and generation of ideas was challenging . 5 . 4 Creativity Support RQ3 investigated if there were differences in the extent of cre - ativity support between SearchIdea and IdeaPad .

Although differences were not significant , the subjects who used SearchIdea reported higher ratings for synthesizing ideas ( 𝑀 𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎 = 4 . 11 , 𝑀 𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑃𝑎𝑑 = 3 . 90 ) and for organizing ideas ( 𝑀 𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎 = 4 . 50 , 𝑀 𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑃𝑎𝑑 = 4 . 03 ) . We noted that IdeaPad was scored slightly higher than SearchIdea for supporting gen - erating new ideas ( 𝑀 𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎 = 3 . 46 and 𝑀 𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑃𝑎𝑑 = 3 . 83 ) . Additionally , subjects scored uniformly SearchIdea and IdeaPad ( 𝑀 𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎 = 3 . 64 and 𝑀 𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑃𝑎𝑑 = 3 . 70 ) . Overall , subjects who used SearchIdea found that the tool was most useful in terms of organizing ideas and synthesizing ideas . We also analyzed responses from the creativity support related questions from the post - system questionnaire ( see Table 5 ) . Sub - jects overall found both tools to be useful in exploration , especially tracking different ideas ( 𝑀 𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎 = 4 . 07 and 𝑀 𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑃𝑎𝑑 = 4 . 10 ) . This is not surprising as both tools provide a feature that can be used to save or keep search results or notes . We also obtained in - teresting results on expressiveness : SearchIdea was scored higher ( 𝑀 𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎 = 3 . 71 and 𝑀 𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑃𝑎𝑑 = 3 . 23 , 𝑡 ( 56 ) = 2 . 087 , 𝑝 = 0 . 04 ) for being creative while completing the task . We believe IdeaMap - per’s visual features may have contributed to this result . Surpris - ingly , IdeaPad was scored slightly higher for immersion and results worth effort . For example , subjects scored IdeaPad highly on los - ing track of time ( 𝑀 𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎 = 3 . 25 and 𝑀 𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑃𝑎𝑑 = 3 . 70 ) and results worth the effort ( 𝑀 𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎 = 3 . 82 and 𝑀 𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑃𝑎𝑑 = 4 . 10 ) . One possible explanation of this result might be the fact that the interface of IdeaPad was familiar and did not require subjects to make an effort to learn using the new features , whereas subjects who used SearchIdea did have to learn how to use the tool . 6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION We developed and evaluated a search tool that supports idea gen - eration during the academic search process through interactive visual features that facilitate prioritizing search results , eliciting keywords and ideas , and organizing ideas . We collected data from multiple sources including system interaction logs , pre - task and post - task questionnaires , post - system questionnaires , think - aloud protocols during searching , and exit interviews . In this paper , we have reported on the results of data analysis from logs and ques - tionnaire responses to address three research questions . The results of our study confirm that SearchIdea encouraged users to engage in searching more actively . For RQ1 , we investigated whether there were differences in search interactions between SearchIdea users and IdeaPad users . We found that subjects using SearchIdea engaged with search results more actively by submitting more and longer queries , generating more unique terms , and becoming more interested in the search topics than did those who used IdeaPad . Diving deeper into the interaction patterns of subjects using SearchIdea shows more en - gagement with search results through interaction with saved results and the movements between SearchMapper and IdeaMapper . Using a mind - mapping feature during searching to facilitate idea gener - ation provided users with opportunities to identify relationships between topics , and to plan , organize , and reflect on the ideas , which led in turn to brainstorming more and better ideas . By contrast , subjects using IdeaPad tended to simply copy and paste the text from the search results page more frequently , rather than engaging with the content from the search results page . 168 SearchIdea : An Idea Generation Tool to Support Creativity in Academic Search CHIIR ’23 , March 19 – 23 , 2023 , Austin , TX , USA Table 4 : Means ( and standard deviations ) for subjects’ responses for idea generation support in the post - system questionnaire .

RQ2 investi - gated how the use of either tool affected users’ perception between search activities and idea generation . We found that there were no differences in the perceptions of subjects who used SearchIdea and IdeaPad , but those subjects who perceived that they had gained some knowledge also thought that searching contributed to their ideas . These results suggest that users’ perception of the link be - tween searching and idea generation is strong , and search tools can facilitate idea generation in academic creative tasks . The visual interactive features provided by SearchIdea supported users in organizing and synthesizing search results . RQ3 investi - gated whether there were differences in the extent of creativity support for searching between SearchIdea and IdeaPad . Analysis of the post - system questionnaire revealed that subjects perceived SearchIdea as more useful in terms of organizing and synthesiz - ing ideas than did those subjects who used IdeaPad . However , SearchIdea users did not perceive that their creativity was sup - ported directly by SearchIdea , as we found no significant difference in creativity support between SearchIdea users and IdeaPad users . There could be multiple reasons for these results ; for example , it could be that subjects using IdeaPad were familiar with a text editor interface and had positive search experiences as often as did the subjects using SearchIdea . Our study design has a few limitations . The evaluation was con - ducted in a controlled experimental setting and we used simulated work tasks ; previous studies have proposed naturalistic environ - ments to evaluate CSTs [ 49 ] . Additionally , the study was designed for a single session , which might have provided limited opportu - nities for subjects to engage with SearchIdea features . For exam - ple , SearchIdea has a search result tracking feature , SearchMapper , which can be beneficial when users want to resume their search at a later time . Nevertheless , the design of the study provided the opportunity to evaluate SearchIdea and IdeaPad in a uniform envi - ronment using the same search tasks over the same set of resources . The simulated tasks did not have any effect on the outcome of the study , as users using SearchIdea and IdeaPad had similar interests in the topics investigated in the two search tasks . We believe that the results of the study provide important in - sights into how an idea generation tool such as SearchIdea can support users in generating more and better ideas while searching . Overall , the findings of our study indicate that introducing visual features in search tools facilitates active engagement with search results , which may support users in creative idea generation . In particular , the use of mind mapping supported users to identify relationships between topics and to organize their ideas . These findings have implications for future research and design for search tools to support generating ideas . Search systems need to provide users with visual idea - generation features to support specific tasks in academic search . First , the use of the mind - mapping feature in SearchIdea allowed users to discover more terms , to identify relationships between topics , and to organize ideas . Second , by externalizing the idea discovery process , users were able to brain - storm and to reflect on ideas . Finally , extending the support of idea generation during academic search , future work should seek to assist users with features that better synthesize ideas after initial ideas are generated .
