Creativity , self - efﬁcacy , and small - ﬁrm performance : the mediating role of entrepreneurial orientation Anis Khedhaouria • Ca˘lin Gura˘u • Olivier Torre ` s Accepted : 28 August 2014 / Published online : 10 September 2014 (cid:2) Springer Science + Business Media New York 2014 Abstract Determinants of small - ﬁrm performance represent a central topic in the entrepreneurship literature . Addressing associations among personal traits , entrepreneurial orientation ( EO ) , and small - ﬁrm performance , we develop a model to examine how an entrepreneur’s creativity , self - efﬁcacy , and EO affect small - ﬁrm performance . The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 256 French small - ﬁrm owners . The ﬁndings show that self - efﬁcacy and EO are positively and directly associated with ﬁrm performance , whereas creativity and ﬁrm performance are fully mediated by EO . These ﬁndings offer important theoretical and practical implications .

Recurrent debates in the literature associate the personal traits of business owners ( Baum and Locke 2004 ; Poon et al . 2006 ; Rauch and Frese 2007 ) with ﬁrm - level entre - preneurial orientation ( EO ) ( Poon et al . 2006 ; Wiklund et al . 2009 ) and small - ﬁrm performance . EO refers to the process by which strategy - making policies and practices are used by ﬁrms to identify and launch new ventures ( Miller 2011 ) . Miller and Friesen ( 1982 ) contend that executive goals and traits are central to driving a ﬁrm’s EO . Consistent with Hambrick and Mason’s ( 1984 ) upper echelons perspective , which posits that CEOs are responsible for helping to set and direct the organization’s strategic orientation , business owners have a major role in inﬂuencing the manifes - tation of EO ( Rauch et al . 2009 ) through risk - taking , innovativeness , and a proactive orientation toward competition ( Covin and Slevin 1988 , 1989 ; Wales et al . 2013 ) . In the present study and based on the Hambrick and Mason’s ( 1984 ) upper echelons per - spective , we interpret EO as the entrepreneur’s orientation and not of the ﬁrm . The signiﬁcant expansion of interest regarding the determinants of small - ﬁrm performance indicates not only its importance but also the controversy that continues to surround ﬁrm performance mechanisms .

In the present study , we associate two entrepreneurial traits with EO to clarify their interrelated associations with small - ﬁrm performance . In the literature , EO is considered as an entrepre - neurial process promoted by business owners and triggered by their individual creativity and self - efﬁcacy ( Fillis and Rentschler 2010 ; Matthews 2007 ; Poon et al . 2006 ; Shane and Nicolaou 2014 ) . Accord - ing to Schumpeter ( 1934 ) , the entrepreneur is a creative , driven individual who ﬁnds new combina - tions of factors of production to develop a new product , to corner a new market , or to design a new technology . Creativity is associated with general self - efﬁcacy , which is deﬁned as an entrepreneur’s belief about his / her ability to reach designated levels of performance ( Markman et al . 2002 ; Prabhu et al . 2008 ) . Our model integrates these constructs to disentangle the mechanism of how personal traits ( i . e . , creativity and self - efﬁcacy ) exert an inﬂuence on EO and small - ﬁrm performance . Our research ques - tion reads as follows : How do an entrepreneur’s creativity , self - efﬁcacy , and EO affect small - ﬁrm performance ? The model is tested using a sample of 256 French small - ﬁrm owners and a partial least squares path modeling ( PLSPM ) approach . Our ﬁndings show that self - efﬁcacy and EO are positively and directly asso - ciated with small - ﬁrm performance , whereas the rela - tionship between creativity and ﬁrm performance is fully mediated by EO . These results suggest that entrepreneurs’ beliefs regarding their capabilities con - tribute to ﬁrm growth ( Baum et al . 2001 ; Baum and Locke 2004 ; Hmieleski andBaron 2008 ; Hmieleski and Corbett 2008 ) and that EO is an entrepreneurial process by which creative ideas are implemented within an organization , thus leading to ﬁrm performance ( Ahlin et al . 2013 ; Fillis and Rentschler 2010 ; Matthews 2007 ; Ward 2004 ) . Our study makes four contributions to the entre - preneurship literature . First , by clarifying the associ - ations between creativity , self - efﬁcacy , EO , and small - ﬁrm performance , we address the call by Wales et al . ( 2013 ) to progress beyond simple discussions of entrepreneurial traits and focus instead on the impli - cations of those traits for company outcomes . Second , our study expands the existing literature ( Poon et al . 2006 ; Rauch et al . 2009 ; Wiklund 1999 ; Wiklund and Shepherd 2005 ; Wiklund et al . 2009 ) by identifying EO as an entrepreneurial process that not only is affected by creativity but also fully mediates the relationship between creativity and small - ﬁrm perfor - mance . Given the important role of EO in changing a company’s strategic direction ( Lumpkin and Dess 1996 , 2001 ) , the tendency of creative entrepreneurs to promote EO can be considered as a path to organiza - tional success . Third , self - efﬁcacy and performance are not mediated by EO , but are directly associated with it , which emphasizes the important role of entrepreneurs’ beliefs in their ability to increase ﬁrm performance ( Baum et al . 2001 ; Baum and Locke 2004 ; Hmieleski and Baron 2008 ; Hmieleski and Corbett 2008 ) . Fourth , whereas the determinants of small - ﬁrm performance represent a broad ﬁeld of interest ( Blackburn et al . 2013 ; Stam et al . 2013 ; Wales et al . 2013 ; Wiklund et al . 2009 ) , little consideration has been given to the association among entrepreneurial traits , EO , and small - ﬁrm performance using large samples of entrepreneurs ( Poon et al . 2006 ) . Our study provides a robust test of such an empirical model , investigating a sample of 256 French small - ﬁrm owners . The paper is structured as follows : Section Two presents a comprehensive literature review , which leads to the formulation of four hypotheses regarding the association among the investigated constructs ; Section Three explains the methodology applied to collect and analyze data ; Section Four presents the results of the data analysis ; and Section Five provides an interpreta - tion of the ﬁndings , which leads to a series of theoretical and practical implications . Section Six emphasizes the study’s main limitations and perspectives for future research . Section Seven concludes our study . 2 Literature review and research hypotheses 2 . 1 EO and small - ﬁrm performance EO is a central concept in entrepreneurship research ( Covin et al . 2006 ; Wiklund 1999 ) . EO has its origins in the work of Mintzberg ( 1973 ) and Khandwalla ( 1977 ) , who ﬁnd that entrepreneurial ﬁrms take more 486 A . Khedhaouria et al . 123 Author ' s personal copy risks and are more proactive in searching for new business opportunities . Building upon these empirical observations , Miller ( 1983 ) deﬁnes EO as a three - dimensional concept encompassing a ﬁrm’s propen - sity to engage in innovative , proactive , and risk - taking actions . Further studies demonstrate the relevance of these dimensions to entrepreneurial success : By creating and introducing new products , services , and technologies , innovative ﬁrms can generate economic performance ( Wiklund et al . 2009 ) ; by proactively implementing and launching these innovations , ﬁrms can develop and maintain their competitive advantage ( Zahra and Covin 1995 ) ; and by taking bold and aggressive steps to exploit opportunities , ﬁrms can generate sustainable , long - term growth ( Lumpkin and Dess 1996 ) . Although EO is considered a complex organiza - tional - level process , in small ﬁrms it has a strong connection with individual behaviors : ‘‘The entrepre - neurial orientation of a ﬁrm is demonstrated by the extent to which the top managers are inclined to take business - related risks ( the risk - taking dimension ) , to favor change and innovation in order to obtain a competitive advantage for their ﬁrm ( the innovation dimension ) , and to compete aggressively with other ﬁrms ( the proactiveness dimension ) ’’ Covin and Slevin ( 1988 , p . 218 ) . EO is directly reﬂected in entrepreneur’s strategy and has a direct impact on ﬁrm performance ( Sapienza and Grimm 1997 ) : ‘‘Entrepre - neurial orientation may be viewed as the entrepre - neurial strategy - making processes that key decision makers use to enact their ﬁrm’s organizational purpose , sustain its vision , and create competitive advantage ( s ) ’’ ( Rauch et al . 2009 , p . 763 ) . The conceptual and empirical arguments of previ - ous research converge on the idea that small ﬁrms beneﬁt from adopting an EO ( Rauch et al . 2009 ) . Wiklund ( 1999 ) suggests that striving to increase EO may be worthwhile for small ﬁrms because a positive relationship has been identiﬁed between EO and ﬁrm performance . Previous studies repeatedly and con - stantly demonstrate a positive relationship between EO and small - ﬁrm performance ( Rauch et al . 2009 ; Schepers et al . 2013 ; Wiklund 1999 ; Wiklund and Shepherd 2005 ; Wiklund et al . 2009 ) , and ‘‘there is reason to believe that EO as an overarching construct can have universally positive performance implica - tions’’ ( Wiklund et al . 2009 , p . 354 ) . Building upon these ﬁndings , we hypothesize as follows : H1 : EO is positively associated with small - ﬁrm performance . 2 . 2 General self - efﬁcacy and small - ﬁrm performance Studies agree that small - ﬁrm performance and orga - nizational outcomes are affected by personal traits ( Baum et al . 2001 ; Blackburn et al . 2013 ; Poon et al . 2006 ; Hambrick and Mason 1984 ; Wiklund et al . 2009 ) . Self - efﬁcacy is considered as a personal trait of entrepreneurs that affects small - ﬁrm performance ( Poon et al . 2006 ) . Self - efﬁcacy is deﬁned as the perceived personal ability to execute target behaviors ( Krueger and Brazeal 1994 ) and to attain designated performance goals ( Bandura 1986 ) by increasing optimism , perseverance and resilience ( Ardichvili et al . 2003 ) . Individuals with high - efﬁcacy beliefs initiate and persist in their behaviors despite uncer - tainty and scarce resources ( Trevelyan 2009 ) , inter - preting failures as learning experiences ( Krueger and Brazeal 1994 ) . Self - efﬁcacy can be assessed through both general traits ( Schwarzer and Jerusalem 1995 ; Schwarzer et al . 1997 ) and entrepreneurial traits ( Chen et al . 1998 ) . General self - efﬁcacy is considered as ‘‘a broad and stable sense of personal competence to deal effectively with a variety of stressful situations’’ ( Luszczynska et al . 2005 , p . 81 ) . Entrepreneurial self - efﬁcacy is deﬁned as a person’s belief in his / her ability to successfully launch an entrepreneurial venture ( McGee et al . 2009 ) . Entrepreneurial self - efﬁcacy creates many problems because entrepreneurial activ - ity includes a large number of potential tasks and associated skills : ‘‘From a purely pragmatic perspec - tive , it is much easier to measure general self - efﬁcacy than to explicitly capture the nuances of entrepreneur - ial self - efﬁcacy’’ ( McGee et al . 2009 , p . 969 ) . Entre - preneurial self - efﬁcacy may also be biased by entrepreneurial knowledge levels ( Føleide 2011 ) . Nascent entrepreneurs have no direct entrepreneurial experience , which makes their evaluation of entrepre - neurial self - efﬁcacy highly questionable . Further - more , experienced entrepreneurs may inﬂate their entrepreneurial self - efﬁcacy scores because of past and / or present success . This can explain the conﬂict - ing results between entrepreneurial self - efﬁcacy and ﬁrm performance , ranging from a positive relationship ( Baum et al . 2001 ; Baum and Locke 2004 ; Hmieleski The mediating role of entrepreneurial orientation 487 123 Author ' s personal copy and Baron 2008 ; Hmieleski and Corbett 2008 ) to negative ( Bandura and Jourden 1991 ; Stone 1994 ; Vancouver et al . 2002 ) or nonsigniﬁcant ( Poon et al . 2006 ) relationships . Considering these shortcomings , a general self - efﬁcacy construct is considered to capture respon - dents’ perceptions of their ability to address and solve challenging problems ( Schwarzer and Jerusa - lem 1995 ; Schwarzer et al . 1997 ) . Consistent with previous research ( Chen et al . 2004 ; Markman et al . 2002 ; Poon et al . 2006 ) , we adopt general self - efﬁcacy as an appropriate personal trait to address ﬁrm performance . There is evidence that general self - efﬁcacy induces a positive emotional drive , persistence , and resilience in the face of difﬁculties , leading entrepreneurs to reach designated perfor - mance goals ( Bartol et al . 2001 ; Judge et al . 2007 ; Markman et al . 2002 ) . Building upon these ﬁndings , we hypothesize as follows : H2 : General self - efﬁcacy is positively associated with small - ﬁrm performance . 2 . 3 Creativity and small - ﬁrm performance Entrepreneurial creativity is deﬁned as the generation and implementation of novel , appropriate ideas to establish a new venture ( Amabile 1997 ) . Pretorius et al . ( 2005 ) outline that ‘‘creativity is clearly part and parcel of the entrepreneurial skills required to suc - cessfully start a venture’’ ( p . 56 ) . Although Amabile ( 1997 ) outlines that entrepreneurial creativity can be exhibited both in established organizations and in start - up ﬁrms , the deﬁnition fails to account for the role of creativity following the creation of a new venture ( Fillis and Rentschler 2010 ) . Other authors emphasize that creativity is fundamental for new venture competitiveness ( Bridge et al . 2003 ; Carson et al . 1995 ; Kao 1989 ; Matthews 2007 ) , with the entrepreneur having a central role in developing and maintaining a creative organizational culture ( Ahlin et al . 2013 ; Cook 1998 ; Fillis 2002 ; Fillis and Rentschler 2006 ; Ward 2004 ) . Creativity and ﬁrm performance have received little attention in the literature ( Gong et al . 2013 ; Weinz - immer et al . 2011 ) . Most studies focus on individual ( Elsbach and Hargadon 2006 ; Perry - Smith 2006 ) or team - level performance ( Gilson et al . 2005 ; Vera and Crossan 2005 ) . The existing empirical results indicate a positive association among creativity , ﬁrm perfor - mance ( Von Nordenﬂycht 2007 ) , and ﬁrm innova - tiveness ( Baron and Tang 2011 ) . Other studies assume a positive association among creativity , ﬁrm perfor - mance , and competitiveness ( Baer and Oldham 2006 ; Gilson 2008 ; Mumford 2003 ; Zhou and Shalley 2008 ) without providing any empirical evidence . Building upon the perspective that creative entrepreneurs are instrumental in achieving performance in small ﬁrms ( Ahlin et al . 2013 ; Fillis and Rentschler 2010 ; Matthews 2007 ; Ward 2004 ) , we hypothesize as follows : H3 : Creativity is positively associated with small - ﬁrm performance . 2 . 4 The mediating role of EO The mediating role of EO between self - efﬁcacy and ﬁrm performance is suggested by Poon et al . ( 2006 ) , who explains that entrepreneurs with high self - efﬁcacy levels can deal with a variety of stressful situations and acquire necessary resources from the environment . These resources can then be allocated toward proactive and innovative projects that enable the ﬁrm to exploit rich opportunities and attain superior performance ( Rosenbusch et al . 2013 ) . Similarly , Rosenbusch et al . ( 2013 ) suggest that EO mediates the relationship between creativity and ﬁrm performance . To explore and exploit new ideas , ﬁrms must adopt proactive and innovative strategies ( Pu - hakka 2012 ) . Because EO emphasizes innovativeness and proactivity and the exploration and exploitation of new products and processes ( Lumpkin and Dess 1996 ) , it is a legitimate response to increase the chances of attaining superior performance ( Rosen - busch et al . 2013 ) . The exploitation of ideas as a means of achieving high performance also entails risk . Thus , the risk - taking dimension of EO can also be argued to have a positive mediating effect ( Rosenbusch et al . 2013 ) . Based on the aforementioned results , we hypothesize as follows : H4a : EO mediates the relationship between self - efﬁcacy and small - ﬁrm performance . H4b : EO mediates the relationship between crea - tivity and small - ﬁrm performance . 488 A .

The dotted associations are not the focus of our research because they are extensively studied elsewhere in the entre - preneurship and management literature . 3 Methods 3 . 1 Data collection Primary data were collected by a research team from the Amarok observatory between March 2011 and December 2012 . Founded in January 2010 , Amarok aimed to study the beliefs , attitudes , and behaviors of French small - business owners . During its develop - ment , Amarok partnered with the French mutual insurance company ‘‘Malakoff Mederic’’ and with the young leaders’ network ‘‘Centre des Jeunes Diri - geants , ’’ which represents 3 , 500 business owners from various economic sectors . An email invitation was sent to the 3 , 500 business owners , 334 of whom agreed to participate in a survey to be administered in March 2011 . Twenty - eight participants abandoned the survey for various reasons ( e . g . , bankruptcy , time pressures , etc . ) , resulting in a sample of 306 participants . From this sample , 256 were selected for this study because they represented small businesses with fewer than 50 employees ( European Commission 2003 ) 1 . These participants were then interviewed by Amarok’s telephone oper - ators , who used a structured questionnaire . The average duration of the telephone interaction with each respondent was approximately 20 min . As shown in Table 1 , 54 % of the ﬁrms from the sample employ less than ten employees , and 46 % employ more than ten employees ( 10 – 49 employees ) , with an average number of approximately 12 employ - ees per ﬁrm . The average age of participants is approximately 44 years , and 81 . 6 % are male . One hundred and sixty of the surveyed entrepreneurs have Table 1 Sample demographics Samplesize ( n = 256 ) Mean ( SD ) Size of the company ( employees ) 11 . 92 ( 11 . 44 ) \ 10 139 3 . 92 ( 2 . 46 ) C 10 117 21 . 43 ( 10 . 63 ) Age ( years ) 44 . 05 ( 9 . 69 ) \ 45 147 38 . 73 ( 4 . 21 ) C 45 109 51 . 23 ( 5 . 07 ) Gender Male 209 – Female 47 – Education level ( years of study ) 4 . 43 ( 1 . 15 ) \ 5 96 3 . 22 ( 0 . 99 ) C 5 160 5 . 16 ( 0 . 36 ) Experience ( years ) 11 . 26 ( 8 . 20 ) B 10 156 6 . 12 ( 2 . 59 ) [ 10 100 19 . 28 ( 7 . 50 ) Creativity ( CREA ) Self - efficacy ( SLFE ) Firm performance ( PERF ) H1 H3 H2 H4 ( a , b ) Entrepreneurial orientation ( EO ) Fig . 1 Research model 1 See European Commission ( 2003 ) . The mediating role of entrepreneurial orientation 489 123 Author ' s personal copy more than 5 years of education , and 100 have more than 10 years of experience . Sample representativeness is assessed by compar - ing the distributions of age , gender , and education level to the population of French small businesses obtained from the National Institute of Statistics and Economics ( INSEE 2012 ) 2 . The t tests are used to assess the null hypotheses that the means of two populations are equal ( Hair et al . 2010 ) . Results show that our sample is representative for the proﬁle of entrepreneurs in French small businesses with respect to age , gender , and education level ( t critical two - tail [ t stat ) . The t test results are reported in Appendix 1 . 3 . 2 Measures To ensure correspondence between the initial scales and the survey questions , all of the measures were translated into French by Amarok researchers and then translated back into English by an independent native speaker in an iterative process until all major differ - ences in phrasing and meaning were eliminated . All of the item measures are reported in Appendix 2 . 3 . 2 . 1 Dependent construct Firm performance can be measured by objective and subjective measures . Objective measures are less prone to common method bias but are difﬁcult to interpret in the context of new ventures ( Stam and Elfring 2008 ) . Subjective measures are commonly used and have been shown to exhibit strong reliability and validity ( Dess and Robinson 1984 ) . To measure ﬁrm performance ( PERF ) , we used three subjective items reﬂecting growth and ﬁnancial performance that we adapted from the entrepreneurship literature ( Wi - klund 1999 ; Wiklund et al . 2009 ) . Respondents were asked to rate their ﬁnancial proﬁt , market value and sales volume using a scale ranging from 1 = ‘‘much worse’’ to 5 = ‘‘much better . ’’ Dillon – Goldstein’s rho value ( q PERF = 0 . 834 ) is in excess of 0 . 7 , indicating good reliability . 3 3 . 2 . 2 Independent constructs The EO concept has raised a series of debates in the literature regarding the nature of the concept ( George 2011 ; George and Marino 2011 ) . The meaning of the construct may be reﬂected in its dimensions ( i . e . , reﬂective construct ) or created by them ( i . e . , formative construct ) . If EO is deﬁned as a second - order reﬂective construct , the dimensions are expected to covary ( George and Marino 2011 ) . This does not mean that the dimensions cannot vary independently of each other . Rather , because EO is only represented by common variance under this deﬁnition , any variance due to factors other than EO will be attributed to error variance . Conversely , if EO is deﬁned as a second - order formative construct , the dimensions can vary independently and may or may not covary . In our research , the dimensions vary independently repre - senting a unique aspect of the EO construct , which has consistently been the case in empirical studies ( Lump - kin and Dess 2001 ; Merz and Sauber 1995 ; Naldi et al . 2007 ) . Accordingly , changes in the dimensions cause changes in the underlying construct and each dimen - sion is considered a partial cause ( MacCallum and Browne 1993 ; MacKenzie et al . 2005 ) . To measure EO , we employed Covin and Slevin’s ( 1989 ) three sub - dimensions encompassing the entre - preneur’s behaviors related to innovativeness ( INN ) , risk - taking ( RISK ) , and proactiveness ( PRO ) . Each sub - dimension was measured using 3 items adapted from Covin and Slevin ( 1989 ) . The respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which each item contained in the measure characterizes their entrepre - neur’s style , using a 7 - point Likert - type scale . Fol - lowing Lumpkin and Dess ( 2001 ) , who noted that the original question employed by Covin and Slevin ( 1989 ) —i . e . , whether an entrepreneur prefers to ‘‘undo the competitors’’ or to ‘‘live and let live’’— measures competitive aggressiveness instead of pro - activeness , we replaced this question with an item adapted from Lumpkin and Dess ( 2001 ) , which asks whether an entrepreneur ‘‘has a tendency to follow up 2 See INSEE ( 2012 ) . 3 According to Chin ( 1998 ) , Dillon - Goldstein’s rho ( q ) is considered a better indicator than Cronbach’s alpha ( a ) . Indeed , Cronbach assumes the so - called tau equivalence ( or parallelity ) of the manifest variables , i . e . , each manifest variable is assumed Footnote 3 continued to be equally important in deﬁning the latent variable . Dillon – Goldstein’s rho does not make this assumption because it is based on the results from the model ( i . e . , the loadings ) rather than on the correlations observed between the manifest variables in the dataset ( Vinzi et al . 2010 ) . For further details about reli - ability , see Table 3 . 490 A . Khedhaouria et al . 123 Author ' s personal copy competitors’’ to adapt to the market , rather than anticipating it . Acknowledging the EO dimensionality debate ( Lumpkin and Dess 2001 ) , we factor - analyzed the items and found that they loaded above 0 . 60 on their corresponding constructs , with eigenvalues exceeding 1 , as recommended by Hair et al . ( 2010 ) . Dillon – Goldstein’s rho ( q ) values ( q INN = 0 . 865 , q RISK = 0 . 806 , q PRO = 0 . 833 ) indicate good reliability . Creativity ( CREA ) was measured using four items originally developed by Tierney et al . ( 1999 ) . Respon - dents used a 7 - point Likert scale ranging from 1 = ‘‘strongly disagree’’ to 7 = ‘‘strongly agree’’ to rate these items . Dillon – Goldstein’s rho value ( q CREA = 0 . 882 ) indicates good reliability . Self - efﬁcacy ( SLFE ) was measured using the general self - efﬁcacy scale ( Schwarzer and Jerusalem 1995 ; Schwarzer et al . 1997 ) . The general self - efﬁcacy scale is composed of ten items that are largely used in psychology research to understand and measure self - beliefs ( Schwarzer et al . 1997 ) . Respondents used a 7 - point Likert scale ranging from 1 = ‘‘strongly disagree’’ to 7 = ‘‘strongly agree’’ to rate these items . Dillon – Goldstein’s rho value ( q SLFF = 0 . 807 ) indi - cates satisfactory reliability . 3 . 2 . 3 Control , moderating , and mediating variables Previous studies suggest that smaller ﬁrms may face more severe challenges in exploiting opportunities because they operate in a competitive environment and have restrained human capital and small resource bases ( Lumpkin and Dess 1996 ; Poon et al . 2006 ; Rauch et al . 2009 ; Wiklund 1999 ; Wiklund et al . 2009 ; Wiklund and Shepherd 2003 , 2005 ) . We therefore controlled for four variables measured as follows ( Wiklund et al . 2009 ) : size effect ( including ﬁrm size and employee management problems ) ; competition ( the nature of competition in the market ) ; human capital ( including the entrepreneur’s age , level of education , and experience ) ; internal difﬁculties ( including ﬁnancial , sales , and administrative difﬁ - culties ) ; and turnover ( including the turnover gener - ated by the largest customers and subcontractors as a proxy of available resources ) . To identify any poten - tially induced variance , we controlled for the moder - ating effects of ﬁrm size ( \ 10 and C 10 employees ) and the entrepreneur’s age ( \ 45 and C 45 years ) , level of education ( \ 5 and C 5 years of study ) , and expe - rience ( B 10 and [ 10 years ) . Moderators were converted into dichotomous variables by splitting the scale at the sample median , thereby deﬁning two categories , which facilitates comparisons between groups with high and low measurement values ( Mac - Callum et al . 2002 ) . There is a general trend in entrepreneurship practice to label entrepreneurs as either having or not having a trait by comparing groups ( e . g . , young and old people , high and low levels of education and experience ) , which is often preliminary to understanding entrepreneurial behaviors ( Kautonen et al . 2011 ; Schepers et al . 2013 ) . If the dichotomi - zation may lead to loss of information , the median split approach is suggested to be more appropriate than the thirds approach ( upper 1 / 3 and lower 1 / 3 of groups ) because it provides better statistical power ( MacCal - lum et al . 2002 ; Royston et al . 2006 ) . Finally , we tested the mediating effect of EO using the bootstrapping approach ( Efron 1988 ; Hayes 2009 ) . 3 . 3 Data transformation As usual , missing values in the data provided by the 306 participants are due to data entry errors , forgotten data , data collection problems , or respondents’ refusal to answer some questions ( Hair et al . 2010 ) . In the present study , all variables have levels of missing data of \ 10 % , which is considered acceptable ( Hair et al . 2010 ) . Little’s MCAR ( missing completely at random ) test was performed using the missing value analysis module of SPSS 20 . 0 and applying the expectation maximization ( EM ) method . The obtained signiﬁ - cance level was 0 . 495 ( chi square = 94 . 5 , df = 95 ) , indicating a nonsigniﬁcant difference between the observed missing data pattern in the reduced sample and a random pattern . This result allows the missing data process to be considered MCAR . The EM imputation method was then applied to replace MCAR data ( Hair et al . 2010 ) .

Using both formative and reﬂective constructs in SEM could lead to misidenti - ﬁcation problems , inadmissible solutions , and factor indeterminacy ( Fornell and Bookstein 1982 ) . The PLS approach is also appropriate for investi - gating complex relationships that combine mediating and moderating effects ( Chin 1998 ; Fornell and Bookstein 1982 ) ; moreover , it processes both small and large samples more easily than SEM ( Chin 1998 ) . 4 Results 4 . 1 Testing the measurement model We ﬁrst assessed the psychometric properties of measurement scales for the ﬁrst - order factors in terms of convergent validity , discriminant validity , and reliability using conﬁrmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) . Measurement scales have a good convergent validity if the factor loadings of items on their corresponding constructs exceed 0 . 60 , or if the average variance extracted ( AVE ) of the construct exceeds 0 . 50 ( Hair et al . 2010 ) . All of the items with factor loadings below the recommended threshold were dropped . The model was then re - examined without the eliminated items . The factor loadings are shown in Table 2 , with all retained items exceeding 0 . 60 on their corresponding constructs , except the ﬁrst item of PERF ( 0 . 593 ) . However , because the average variance extracted ( AVE ) of the PERF construct exceeds the recommended threshold of 0 . 50 ( i . e . , 0 . 633 ) , all measurement scales have adequate conver - gent validity ( Hair et al . 2010 ) . To assess discriminant validity , we compared the square root of the average variance extracted ( AVE ) for every construct , with the intercorrelations obtained among these constructs ( Chin 1998 ) , where the square root of AVE should be greater than the intercorrelation estimates ( Hair et al . 2010 ) . The correlation matrix ( Table 3 ) indicates that the square roots of AVE displayed on the diagonal are greater than the corre - sponding off - diagonal inter - construct correlations , providing good evidence of discriminant validity . The composite reliability scores for reﬂective measurement scales exceed the recommended thresh - old of 0 . 70 ( Hair et al . 2010 ) , indicating good reliability among the retained items ( see Table 3 ) . Finally , to address the common method variance ( CMV ) problem , we used Harman’s ( 1976 ) one - factor test in an attempt to isolate the covariance due to artifactual reasons ( Podsakoff and Organ 1986 ) . The rule of thumb is that a single unrotated principal component should not explain more than the threshold level of 50 % of the variance , for all of the indicators Table 3 Discriminant validity Compositereliability ( q ) Correlation of constructs a CREA INN RISK PRO SLFE PERF ZE IDIF COM HC TO CREA 0 . 882 0 . 807 INN 0 . 865 0 . 257 0 . 827 RISK 0 . 806 0 . 234 0 . 435 0 . 763 PRO 0 . 833 0 . 273 0 . 341 0 . 338 0 . 791 SLFE 0 . 807 0 . 301 0 . 045 0 . 111 0 . 171 0 . 716 PERF 0 . 834 0 . 070 0 . 132 0 . 101 0 . 131 0 . 206 0 . 795 SE 1 . 000 0 . 020 - 0 . 055 0 . 047 - 0 . 012 - 0 . 031 - 0 . 031 n / a IDIF 1 . 000 0 . 054 0 . 124 0 . 087 0 . 059 0 . 032 - 0 . 108 0 . 085 n / a COM 1 . 000 0 . 021 - 0 . 024 - 0 . 015 - 0 . 078 0 . 018 - 0 . 066 0 . 015 0 . 102 n / a HC 1 . 000 0 . 014 0 . 005 0 . 082 - 0 . 057 - 0 . 032 - 0 . 079 - 0 . 103 - 0 . 091 - 0 . 037 n / a TO 1 . 000 - 0 . 057 0 . 048 0 . 039 - 0 . 002 - 0 . 107 - 0 . 221 0 . 171 0 . 055 - 0 . 067 - 0 . 053 n / a a Diagonal elements are the square root of the AVE are in bold ; CREA creativity , INN innovation , RISK risk - taking , PRO proactiveness , SLFE self - efﬁcacy , PERF ﬁrm performance , SE size effect , IDIF internal difﬁculties , COM competition , HC human capital , TO turnover 494 A . Khedhaouria et al . 123 Author ' s personal copy measured with the same method . Our results show an explained variance of 21 . 551 % , indicating no CMV issues . 4 . 2 Testing the structural model Because EO can be conceptualized as a second - order aggregate construct , we ran the full research model in PLS , disaggregating the EO’s sub - dimensions . Fol - lowing Vinzi et al . ’s ( 2010 ) recommendations , the generated latent variable scores were then used as formative measures of the aggregate EO construct . An important concern with formatively measured constructs is the level of multicollinearity across formative sub - dimensions ( Diamantopoulos et al . 2008 ) . We tested the formative construct for multi - collinearity by calculating the variance inﬂation factor ( VIF ) values . As shown in Table 4 , all VIF values are well below the threshold of 3 . 30 suggested by Diamantopoulos and Siguaw ( 2006 ) , indicating no serious multicollinearity issues . Another concern with formatively measured con - structs is the weight signiﬁcance of sub - dimensions ( Diamantopoulos and Siguaw 2006 ) . The weight is similar to the path coefﬁcient and explains the effect of each dimension on the formative construct ( Hair et al . 2010 ) . Because content validity is affected by remov - ing formative sub - dimensions , eliminating items from the pool should be theoretically justiﬁed rather than merely based on empirical results ( Diamantopoulos et al . 2008 ) . Because each of the nonsigniﬁcant sub - dimensions ( i . e . , INN and RISK ) is a part of EO construct ( see Table 5 ) and has signiﬁcant bivariate correlation ( r INN = 0 . 662 and r RISK = 0 . 680 ) , we retained all sub - dimensions despite their nonsigniﬁ - cant weights ( Diamantopoulos et al . 2008 ; George and Marino 2011 ) . Rerunning the model with the nonsig - niﬁcant dimensions removed yielded similar results as the model that included all sub - dimensions . Once all sub - dimensions were validated , we tested our six hypotheses . Figure 2 shows the results of the model with joint controls ( see Table 6 for details ) . As hypothesized , the relationships expressed by H1 ( b = 0 . 156 , p \ 0 . 05 ) and H2 ( b = 0 . 172 , p \ 0 . 01 ) are positive and signiﬁcant , whereas H3 is not validated . The model explains 11 . 5 % ( R 2 ) of the EO variance and 12 . 9 % of the performance variance ( PERF ) . The goodness of ﬁt of our model ( GoF ) is 0 . 229 , which exceeds the cutoff value of 0 . 1 for small effect sizes of R 2 , as suggested by Tenenhaus et al . ( 2005 ) . To test the model robustness with a better precision and stability ( Hair et al . 2010 ) , we ﬁrst examined the separate direct effects of CREA , SLFE , and EO on PERF . The results show that the test does not affect the relationships : EO ? PERF ( b = 0 . 158 , p \ 0 . 05 ) ; CREA ? PERF ( b = 0 . 070 , nonsigniﬁcant ) ; SLFE ? PERF ( b = 0 . 206 , p \ 0 . 001 ) . Second , we separately added the following : ( 1 ) the model’s control variables : human capital ( HC ) , size effect ( SE ) , competition ( COM ) , internal difﬁculties ( IDIF ) , and turnover ( TO ) ; ( 2 ) the moderators : ﬁrm size , age , study , and experience ; and ( 3 ) the interactions : SLFE * EO and CREA * EO ( see Table 6 ) . The results indicate that the model remains stable and Table 4 Multicollinearity statistics Statistics EO sub - dimensions INN RISK PRO R 2 0 . 232 0 . 230 0 . 161 VIF = ( 1 / 1 - R 2 ) 1 . 302 1 . 299 1 . 192 INN innovation , RISK risk - taking , PRO proactiveness Table 5 Weights for aggregate and formative constructs Latent variable ( constructs ) Manifest variables ( dimensions ) Weights ( t test ) Bivariate correlations ( t test ) EO INN 0 . 291 ( 1 . 427 ) 0 . 662 * * * ( 4 . 975 ) RISK 0 . 328 ( 1 . 627 ) 0 . 680 * * * ( 5 . 036 ) PRO 0 . 666 * * * ( 3 . 972 ) 0 . 877 * * * ( 7 . 733 ) Values in parentheses represent t test INN innovation , RISK risk - taking , PRO proactiveness * * * p \ 0 . 001 The mediating role of entrepreneurial orientation 495 123 Author ' s personal copy relationships are not affected by control variables and interactions and do not vary with moderators ( size , age , study , and experience ) , with the exception that study ( EO ? PERF as the difference [ D = 0 . 350 ] is signiﬁcant at p \ 0 . 05 , which means that EO exhibits a high association with PERF at high educational levels ) . The joint introduction of all control variables in the same model does not affect the investigated relationships and inevitably improves the explained variance of PERF to R 2 = 12 . 9 % . Third , we tested the mediation of EO using the bootstrapping approach ( Efron 1988 ; Hayes 2009 ) , as shown in Table 7 . We examined whether it is possible , with 95 % conﬁdence ( Bootstrap = 100 ) , that the true indirect effect would be zero ( essentially , no mediation ) . Bootstrap results for indirect effects indicate that EO does not mediate SLFE and PERF because the indirect effect is not signiﬁcant ( b = 0 . 026 lying in between - 0 . 028 and 0 . 077 , but 0 is a possible value between LB and UB ) ; therefore , H4a is not validated . EO fully mediates CREA and PERF because the indirect effect is signiﬁcant ( b = 0 . 06 , lying between 0 . 007 and 0 . 116 , and 0 does not occur between LB and UB ) ; consequently , H4b is validated . 4 5 Discussion The present study addresses the question of how an entrepreneur’s creativity , self - efﬁcacy , and EO affect small - ﬁrm performance . Although determinants of ﬁrm performance represent a broad ﬁeld of interest ( Blackburn et al . 2013 ; Stam et al . 2013 ; Wales et al . 2013 ) , little consideration has been given to empiri - cally examining associations among entrepreneurial traits ( i . e . , creativity and self - efﬁcacy ) , EO ( i . e . , innovativeness , risk - taking , and proactiveness ) , and small - ﬁrm performance within large samples of entrepreneurs . We built our conceptualization on the fact that small - business entrepreneurs have a major role in inﬂuencing the manifestation of EO ( Poon et al . 2006 ; Rauch et al . 2009 ) . We ﬁnd that self - efﬁcacy and EO are positively and directly associated with small - ﬁrm performance ( H1 and H2 are signiﬁcant ) , whereas creativity and ﬁrm performance are fully mediated by EO ( H4b is signiﬁcant ) . Our results challenge previous ﬁndings in the entrepreneurship literature . First , the signiﬁcant asso - ciation between EO and small - ﬁrm performance ( H1 ) conﬁrms that entrepreneurial processes play an impor - tant role in small - business growth ( Rauch et al . 2009 ; Wiklund 1999 ; Wiklund et al . 2009 ) . This signiﬁcant association can be explained at individual level by the role of an entrepreneur’s creativity as a foundation for innovativeness , risk - taking , and proactiveness ( Ahlin et al . 2013 ; Ward 2004 ) . From a theoretical perspec - tive , our study provides additional empirical evidence that entrepreneurs with high level of EO may lead their ﬁrms to high levels of performance and growth . Second , the signiﬁcant association between self - efﬁcacy and ﬁrm performance ( H2 ) is an important contribution for the entrepreneurship literature because few studies ﬁnd that the general self - efﬁcacy of entrepreneurs affects their small - ﬁrm performance 4 The nonsigniﬁcant direct relationship between CREA and PERF means that there is an indirect effect of CREA on PERF mediated by EO . 0 . 312 * * * ( t = 5 . 037 ) Creativity ( CREA ) Self - efficacy ( SLFE ) H1 = 0 . 156 * ( t = 2 . 447 ) H3 = - 0 . 038 ( t = - 0 . 573 ) H2 = 0 . 172 * * ( t = 2 . 731 ) 0 . 069 ( t = 1 . 121 ) 0 . 301 * * * ( t = 5 . 028 ) Entrepreneurial orientation ( EO ) Note : * * * p < 0 . 001 ; * * p < 0 . 01 ; * p < 0 . 05 Firm performance ( PERF ) Fig . 2 PLS - standardized results 496 A .

Our ﬁnding suggests that entrepreneurs’ beliefs about their capabilities may contribute to reaching designated performance goals ( Bartol et al . 2001 ; Judge et al . 2007 ) . One of the ways in which self - efﬁcacy affects performance is through conscientiousness ( Judge et al . 2007 ) .

Third , and interestingly , the nonsigniﬁcant associ - ation between creativity and small - ﬁrm performance ( H3 ) is somewhat contrary to previous studies ( Von Nordenﬂycht 2007 ) . Nevertheless , this result seems to be coherent because creativity ( i . e . , the generation of new and useful ideas ) is different from innovation ( i . e . , the successful implementation of ideas to achieve economic performance ) ( Ahlin et al . 2013 ) . The generation of creative ideas cannot directly improve ﬁrm performance ( Gong et al . 2013 ; Weinzimmer et al . 2011 ) , but creative ideas should be developed , adapted and implemented within an organization to improve ﬁrm performance ( Ahlin et al . 2013 ) . The relationship between creativity and small - ﬁrm perfor - mance should be viewed as mediated by EO . Thus , creativity is indirectly associated with ﬁrm perfor - mance through increased innovativeness , risk - taking , and proactiveness ( Ahlin et al . 2013 ; Ward 2004 ) . This observation indicates that creativity is considered as a valuable ‘raw material’ that needs to be proactively reﬁned and implemented through EO processes ( Pu - hakka 2012 ) . Fourth , the fact that EO fully mediates creativity and ﬁrm performance ( H4b ) suggests that EO is a creative process by which entrepreneurs implement new ideas within their organizations , which leads to successful innovation and high performance ( Ahlin et al . 2013 ; Fillis and Rentschler 2010 ) . This ﬁnding provides an understanding of how entrepreneurial creativity inﬂuences small - ﬁrm performance . In their pursuit of ‘‘greatness , ’’ creative entrepreneurs push their ﬁrms to reach growth and success . However , the pursuit of growth by creative entrepreneurs requires an entrepreneurial process that leads to superior ﬁrm performance . EO fulﬁlls this role ( Wales et al . 2013 ) . Through its emphasis on innovativeness , risk - taking , and proactiveness in the pursuit of new opportunities , EO enables the development and exploitation of creative ideas for small - ﬁrm growth ( Covin et al . 2006 ) . Although higher EO may also result in decreased performance , creative entrepreneurs are less concerned with this risk and therefore tend to lead ﬁrms that are more entrepreneurial ( Wales et al . 2013 ) . From a practical perspective , our ﬁndings suggest important implications for entrepreneurs . According to our ﬁndings , creativity is a personal capacity that can and should be developed and nurtured ( Ahlin et al . 2013 ) . Although most entrepreneurs have limited free time , they must engage in activities that enhance their creativity ( Ahlin et al . 2013 ; Ward 2004 ) . Training can provide entrepreneurs with guidance on how to generate useful ideas , increase skills , accept changes , explore and exploit opportunities ( Ahlin et al . 2013 ) . Self - efﬁcacy can also be enhanced through speciﬁc training methods and intervention strategies ( Gist 1989 ) . For instance , behavioral modeling ( i . e . , watch - ing others ) may provide information about abilities because ‘‘people partly judge their capabilities in comparison with others’’ ( Bandura 1988 , p . 143 ) . Modeling appears to be a particularly effective means of providing information about ‘‘correct’’ performance strategies because this information may not be avail - able otherwise ( Gist and Mitchell 1992 ) . The infor - mation cues method is another training approach ( Bandura and Cervone 1986 ) , which includes feed - back or instructions about personal abilities , providing information about the amount of effort that an entrepreneur should invest to solve a problem and / or to generate useful ideas . 6 Limitations and future research The present study has a number of limitations that must be addressed in future research . First , although a substantial amount of the variance in performance is explained by creativity , self - efﬁcacy , and EO in the model ( R 2 = 12 . 9 % ) , explanatory power and overall goodness of ﬁt could be improved . Many antecedent factors of performance were not included in our model . For instance , personal traits such as the internal locus of control ( Ahmed 1985 ) and achievement Table 7 Testing mediation using bootstrapping in PLS Bootstrap results for indirect effects Indirecteffect ( b ) Standarderror ( SE ) LB ( 95 % ) UB ( 95 % ) SLFE ?

PERF , from CREA to PERF mediated by EO ; LB , lower bound of the conﬁdence interval at the 95 % ; UB , upper bound of the conﬁdence interval at the 95 % 498 A . Khedhaouria et al . 123 Author ' s personal copy motivation ( Poon et al . 2006 ) have been shown to be associated with EO and performance . Similarly , it has been suggested that market dynamism and hostility inﬂuence small - business performance ( Wiklund et al . 2009 ) . Future studies should attempt to replicate our model and to introduce other personal traits to improve the explicative power of performance . Second , in the present study , and consistent with past research practices , ﬁrm performance is assessed using subjective self - reported measures ( Dess and Robinson 1984 ) . Although subjective performance measures exhibit strong reliability and validity , objective perfor - mance measures are less prone to common method bias ( Stam and Elfring 2008 ) . Further research is required to reduce bias and to capture the multidimensionality of ﬁrm performance by combining objective and sub - jective measures ( Wiklund and Shepherd 2005 ) . Third , self - efﬁcacy is assessed applying the general self - efﬁcacy scale commonly used in psychology research ( Schwarzer and Jerusalem 1995 ; Schwarzer et al . 1997 ) . Despite the high reliability of the self - efﬁcacy measure ( q SLFF = 0 . 807 ) , retaining only four items that exceed the recommended threshold of factor loadings ( Hair et al . 2010 ) from the initial scale comprising ten items may lead to some bias . To address this issue , additional research is needed to assess self - efﬁcacy using a more complete entrepre - neurial scale ( Chen et al . 1998 ) . Fourth , association is meant to describe relations that can occur more often either together or not together ( Holland 1986 ) . Using the association approach , self - efﬁcacy and ﬁrm performance can alternatively be explained by the phenomenon of reverse causation ( Bartol et al . 2001 ) . In a successful business , self - efﬁcacy represents an emotional drive that provides entrepreneurs with self - conﬁdence in their abilities to achieve performance goals and growth ( Chandler and Jansen 1992 ) . To overcome this issue , longitudinal studies are needed to prevent cross - sectional data and to increase our knowledge concerning potential associations and causations between investigated variables ( Holland 1986 ) . Fifth , although our measurement strategy isunlikely to suffer from common method biases , more research is warranted ( Podsakoff et al . 2003 ) . A data collection instrument that uses only self - reported measures may lead to bias , especially when data are collected at the same point in time . To overcome this issue , future research should collate different measures spaced over time , or use separate primary and secondary observa - tions ( Podsakoff and Organ 1986 ) . 7 Conclusion Usingasampleof256Frenchsmall - businessownersour model deals with the interplay between an entrepre - neur’s creativity , self - efﬁcacy , entrepreneurial orienta - tion ( EO ) , and small - ﬁrm performance . Our ﬁndings provide useful insights for both academic researchers and practitioners . It shows the mediating role of EO between creativity and small - ﬁrm performance while creativity has no direct effect on ﬁrm performance . This means that creativity can be considered as a ‘‘raw material’’ that contributes to ﬁrm performance only in case the entrepreneur shows a sufﬁciently high level of EO . Self - efﬁcacy and performance are not mediated by EO , but self - efﬁcacy has a direct association with ﬁrm performance . In other words : Even when controlled for creativity and self - efﬁcacy , EO has a direct association with small - ﬁrm performance . Our results provide entre - preneurs with useful insights to enhance their small - ﬁrm’s performance . Entrepreneurs should promote their EO by encouraging innovation , risk - taking , and proac - tiveness to enable the exploration and exploitation of creative ideas . Moreover , entrepreneurs should believe in their capabilities of building , which contributes to reach designated performance goals . Further research is needed to progress beyond simple discussions of entrepreneurial traits and focus instead on the implica - tions of those traits for company outcomes .
