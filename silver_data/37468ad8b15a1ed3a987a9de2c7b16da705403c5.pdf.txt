RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access A novel splice variant of the stem cell marker LGR5 / GPR49 is correlated with the risk of tumor - related death in soft - tissue sarcoma patients Swetlana Rot 1 † , Helge Taubert 2 , 4 , 5 † , Matthias Bache 1 , Thomas Greither 3 , Peter Würl 6 , Alexander W Eckert 2 , Johannes Schubert 2 , Dirk Vordermark 1 † and Matthias Kappler 2 * † Abstract Background : The human leucine - rich , repeat - containing G protein - coupled receptor ( LGR ) 5 , also called GPR49 , is a marker of stem cells in adult intestinal epithelium , stomach and hair follicles . LGR5 / GPR49 is overexpressed in tumors of the colon , ovary and liver and in basal cell carcinomas . Moreover , an expression in skeletal muscle tissues was also detected . However , there has been no investigation regarding the expression and function of LGR5 / GPR49 in soft - tissue sarcomas ( STS ) yet . Methods : Seventy - seven frozen tumor samples from adult STS patients were studied using quantitative real - time TaqMan ™ PCR analysis . The mRNA levels of wild type LGR5 / GPR49 and a newly identified splice variant of LGR5 / GPR49 lacking exon 5 ( that we called GPR49 Δ 5 ) were quantified . Results : A low mRNA expression level of GPR49 Δ 5 , but not wild type LGR5 / GPR49 , was significantly correlated with a poor prognosis for the disease - associated survival of STS patients ( RR = 2 . 6 ; P = 0 . 026 ; multivariate Cox ’ s regression hazard analysis ) . Furthermore , a low mRNA expression level of GPR49 Δ 5 was associated with a shorter recurrence - free survival ( P = 0 . 043 ) . However , tumor onset in patients with a lower expression level of GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA occurred 7 . 5 years later ( P = 0 . 04 ) than in patients with a higher tumor level of GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA . Conclusion : An attenuated mRNA level of the newly identified transcript variant GPR49 Δ 5 is a negative prognostic marker for disease - associated and recurrence - free survival in STS patients . Additionally , a lower GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA level is associated with a later age of tumor onset . A putative role of GPR49 Δ 5 expression in tumorigenesis and tumor progression of soft tissue sarcomas is suggested . Background Treatment options for soft tissue sarcomas ( STS ) are often limited to surgery with the possibility of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy . The 5 - year survival rate for STS patients is approximately 50 % and depends strongly on the tumor stage [ 1 ] . Therefore , it is neces - sary to develop new prognostic markers with the poten - tial to estimate the efficacy of an individual therapeutic strategy . STS are a heterogeneous group of relatively aggressive tumors probably originating from adult mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs ) [ 2 - 4 ] . A study regarding a subgroup of STS ( malignant fibrous histiocytoma ; MFH ) described hMSCs as the progenitors of MFH . Furthermore , the authors reported a novel tumor suppression role for Wnt signaling in solid tumors , which may have the potential for a new therapeutic strategy in sarcomas [ 5 ] . Here , we investigated the prognostic impact of the stem cell marker , cancer - associated gene and Wnt / Tcf4 target gene LGR5 / GPR49 [ 6 ] in STS for the first time . The leucine - rich repeat - containing G protein - coupled receptor LGR5 / GPR49 has been identified as a novel stem cell marker in intestinal epithelia , stomach , and hair follicles [ 7 - 9 ] . Furthermore , LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA was found to be expressed in normal human skeletal * Correspondence : matthias . kappler @ medizin . uni - halle . de † Contributed equally 2 Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Plastic Surgery , Martin - Luther - University Halle - Wittenberg , Halle ( S ) , Germany Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Rot et al .

LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA is expressed in basal cell carci - noma ( tumor of hair follicle ) , colorectal cancer and in tumors of the colon , ovary and liver [ 10 - 13 ] . Investiga - tions of the LGR5 / GPR49 protein expression are rare [ 14 , 15 ] because a full accepted antibody against LGR5 / GPR49 is not available at the moment [ 6 , 16 ] . However , a prognostic impact of LGR5 / GPR49 has not been shown so far . The function of LGR5 / GPR49 in tumorigenesis is sup - ported by its ability to induce transformation of NIH3T3 cells in the presence of conditioned media from colorectal tumor cells . These findings indicate the possibility that the ligand of LGR5 / GPR49 could be secreted by tumor cells [ 10 ] . McClanahan and collea - gues therefore suggest a role for LGR5 / GPR49 as a member of a novel class of transforming oncogenes and , as a result , a new potential molecular target for thera - peutic intervention [ 10 ] . To our knowledge only one transcript variant of LGR5 / GPR49 , which lacks exon 8 , is published in the ExPASy UniProtKB - data bank as variant VSP _ 037746 http : / / www . uniprot . org / uniprot / O75473 . In this study , we identified a novel transcript variant of LGR5 / GPR49 that lacks exon 5 ( GPR49 Δ 5 ) ( listed by us in the EMBL - Bank ; http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / ena / data / view / FN820440 ) . These variants are very interesting because both pub - lished LGR5 / GPR49 variants have a truncated ligand binding extracellular domain [ 6 , 10 ] . It is possible that the affinity of these variants to the recently identified ligand of the full length LGR5 / GPR49 gene product [ 17 ] is different or that different ligands could bind to the shortened receptor . In summary , we report the first results for a newly identified variant of the LGR5 / GPR49 gene , lacking exon 5 , that we call GPR49 Δ 5 . This is the first study that has demonstrated a prognostic impact of a LGR5 / GPR49 variant in STS . In a multivariate Cox ’ s regression analy - sis , we found that a low GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA level is an independent negative prognostic marker for disease - associated survival as well as for recurrence - free survival in STS patients . Methods Tissue samples and histopathological data We examined frozen tumor samples from 77 STS patients using a real - time quantitative TaqMan ™ analy - sis . The patients ’ median age was 59 years ( ranging from 22 to 87 years ) . Forty - one patients ( 53 % ) died from their tumor after an average time of 28 months ( ranging from 2 - 119 months ) , and 36 patients ( 47 % ) were still alive after an average observation period ( i . e . after primary tumor resection ) of 65 months ( ranging from 11 - 146 months ) . The histopathological and clinical data has been summarized in Table 1 as described previously [ 18 ] . All tumor samples were collected before radio - or chemotherapy . After the tumor operation 27 / 77 patients were treated only with radiotherapy , two out of 77 patients were treated only with chemotherapy , and four patients were treated with a combination of chemother - apy and radiotherapy . The study was carried out in compliance with the Hel - sinki Declaration , and it was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University Halle . All patients gave written informed consent ( Department of Surgery 1 , University of Leipzig , Germany ) . Quantitative RT - PCR Isolation of total RNA and cDNA synthesis were per - formed according to standard protocols as described previously [ 19 ] . The cDNA was amplified by automated real - time quantitative TaqMan ™ assays for the wild type LGR5 / GPR49 and GPR49 Δ 5 transcript variants and Hypoxanthin - guanine - phosphoribosyltransferase ( HPRT ) transcript using kits from Roboscreen ( AJRo - boscreen GmbH , Leipzig , Germany ) . Wild type LGR5 / GPR49 and GPR49 Δ 5 transcript amounts were correlated to HPRT transcript amounts as zeptomole ( zmol , 10 - 21 ) wild type LGR5 / GPR49 or GPR49 Δ 5 mRNAs per molecule HPRT mRNA in dupli - cate measurements . An elevated expression of wild type LGR5 / GPR49 was determined as an expression of > 1 . 07 × 10 - 5 zmol wild type LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA / molecule HPRT mRNA and for GPR49 Δ 5 as an expression of > 7 . 6 × 10 - 6 zmol GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA / molecule HPRT mRNA . Statistical analysis Cox ’ s regression hazard models and Kaplan - Meier ana - lyses were used to estimate a correlation of wild type LGR5 / GPR49 and GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA with disease - asso - ciated survival of STS patients . Cox ’ s regression hazard model was adjusted to the prognostic effect of covari - ates ( gender of patients , tumor stage , tumor entity , tumor localization , and type of tumor resection ) , and the relative risk ( RR ) was calculated . For analyzing the recurrence - free survival of STS patients , a Kaplan - Meier analysis was performed . The follow - up time starts with the day of primary tumor operation . The end point for the disease - associated survival analysis was the time of death of the patient . The end point for the recurrence - free survival analysis was the first recurrence . The interrelationship between gene expres - sion levels was tested with the Spearman ’ s rank corre - lation ( r , correlation coefficient ) . A probability ( P ) of < 0 . 05 was defined as significant . Statistical analyses were Rot et al .

Results Correlation of the mRNA expression level with survival of the STS patients The median transcript ratios of 77 STS samples were 1 . 07 × 10 - 5 ( ranging from 0 - 4 . 1 × 10 - 3 ; mean 2 . 3 × 10 - 4 ) zmol wild type LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA and 7 . 6 × 10 - 6 ( ranging from 0 - 6 . 4 × 10 - 3 ; mean 2 . 5 × 10 - 4 ) zmol GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA / molecule HPRT mRNA , respectively . For the survival analysis , STS patients ’ data were sepa - rated according to the median expression levels . GPR49 low expression was defined as ≤ 1 . 07 * 10 - 5 GPR49 mRNA / molecule HPRT mRNA ( 39 patients ) and high expression was defined as > 1 . 07 * 10 - 5 GPR49 mRNA / Table 1 Histopathological and clinical data Category Patients GPR49 - mRNA level in zmol / molecule HPRT GPR49 Δ 5 - mRNA level in zmol / molecule HPRT ≤ 1 . 07 * 10 - 5 > 1 . 07 * 10 - 5 ≤ 7 . 6 * 10 - 6 > 7 . 6 * 10 - 6 Total 77 39 38 39 38 P = 0 . 429 P = 0 . 212 Men 35 16 19 15 20 Women 42 23 19 24 18 Tumor stage P = 0 . 023 * P = 0 . 005 * I 10 1 9 0 10 II 33 21 12 21 12 III 26 12 14 13 13 IV 8 5 3 5 3 Tumor type P = 0 . 194 P = 0 . 166 liposarcoma 19 6 13 5 14 fibrosarcoma / malignant fibrous histiocytoma 20 9 11 11 9 neurogenic sarcoma 6 3 3 3 3 rhabdomyosarcoma / leiomyosarcoma 22 15 7 14 8 Other STS 10 6 4 6 4 Tumor resection P = 0 . 377 P = 0 . 172 radical ( R0 ) 51 24 27 23 28 not radical ( R1 ) 26 15 11 16 10 Patients at follow - up alive 36 15 21 13 23 dead 41 24 17 26 15 Localization P = 0 . 444 P = 0 . 207 extremities 49 25 24 26 23 thorax 6 2 4 1 5 head 1 0 1 0 1 abdomen 19 10 9 10 9 multiple 2 2 0 2 0 Metastasis P = 0 . 291 P = 0 . 025 * M0 21 9 12 7 14 M1 29 17 12 19 10 Age of tumor onset P = 0 . 218 P = 0 . 039 * age ( mean ) 59 . 9 55 . 4 61 . 4 53 . 9 Kaplan - Meier analysis P = 0 . 056 P = 0 . 004 * mean survival ( months ) 50 . 1 ± 6 . 5 80 . 3 ± 10 . 7 45 . 8 ± 6 . 4 86 . 2 ± 10 . 9 Univariate Cox ’ s Regression P = 0 . 06 P = 0 . 006 * RR 1 . 8 2 . 5 CI 0 . 97 - 3 . 5 1 . 3 - 4 . 8 Multiv .

For GPR49 Δ 5 , low expression was defined as ≤ 7 . 6 * 10 - 6 GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA / molecule HPRT mRNA ( 39 patients and high expression was defined as > 7 . 6 * 10 - 6 GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA / molecule HPRT ) ( 38 patients ) . The separation was based on the median expression level of the wild type LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA and GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA ( see also Table 1 ) . We performed a Kaplan - Meier analysis , which detected that STS patients with a lower intratumoral expression of wild type LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA died an average of 30 months earlier ( P = 0 . 056 ) , with lower intratumoral GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA expression died an average of 40 months earlier ( P = 0 . 004 ) than patients who had higher intratumoral expression of wild type LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA and GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA , respectively ( Table 1 ) . Multivariate Cox ’ s regression hazard analysis revealed an increased risk ( RR = 1 . 8 , P = 0 . 12 , Table 1 ) of tumor - related death for patients with a low wild type LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA level and a 2 . 6 - fold ( P = 0 . 026 ) increased risk for STS patients with a low level of GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA in their tumors , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . Moreover , when we estimated recurrence - free survival , a low level of GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA expression was signifi - cantly associated with an early recurrence ( P = 0 . 043 ; Figure 2 ) , whereas low wild type LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA expression levels had no significant effect ( P = 0 . 20 ) . Furthermore , we found a significant difference in tumor onset ( 7 . 5 yrs ) between STS patients with a low level compared to patients with a high level of GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA expression ( 61 . 4 vs . 53 . 9 yrs ) in their tumors ( P = 0 . 039 ; Student ’ s t - test , Table 1 ; Figure 3 ) . Correlation with clinical parameters Bivariate analysis demonstrated that low expression of wild type LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA correlated with higher tumor stage ( P = 0 . 02 ) . Low expression of GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA was also significantly associated with higher tumor stage ( P = 0 . 005 ) and , moreover , with the occur - rence of late distant metastases ( P = 0 . 025 ) ( Table 1 ) . The mean intratumoral expression of GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA in the primary tumor was a 6fold lesser ( 6 . 9 × 10 - 5 vs . 4 . 3 × 10 - 4 zmol GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA / molecule HPRT mRNA ) for those patients ( n = 29 ) who developed metastases compared to patients ( n = 21 ) without metastases . Discussion In this study , we demonstrated that a low GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA level is a negative prognostic marker for disease - Figure 1 Multivariate Cox ’ s hazard regression model for GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA expression level and disease - associated survival in STS patients . Expression level of GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA in STS of 77 patients was correlated with disease - associated survival . The model was adjusted to patients ’ gender , tumor stage , tumor localization , tumor entity , and the type of tumor resection . The high and low cut - off values for GPR49 Δ 5 were > 7 . 6 × 10 - 5 and ≤ 7 . 6 × 10 - 5 zmol GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA / molecule HPRT mRNA ( RR = 2 . 6 , P = 0 . 026 ) . Rot et al .

LGR5 / GPR49 labels stem cells in intestines , stomach and hair follicles [ 7 - 9 ] . When compared to correspond - ing normal tissues , LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA is overex - pressed in human hepatocellular carcinomas , basal cell carcinoma , colon - , colorectal - and ovarian tumors [ 10 - 13 , 20 ] . However , Yamamoto et al . found no signifi - cant association between expression of LGR5 / GPR49 and clinicopathologic features of tumors [ 12 ] . We found that low mRNA expression of GPR49 Δ 5 has a prognos - tic impact for STS patients . Why does low expression impact survival ? We found that low expression of wild type LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA ( P = 0 . 023 ) , as well as low expression of GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA ( P = 0 . 005 ) , was significantly associated with a higher tumor stage . STS patients with high - stage tumors have a poorer prognosis than those with low - stage tumors [ 21 ] . In accordance with our results , McClanahan and collea - gues observed that in both colorectal and ovarian carci - nomas expression of LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA was high in stage I and II tumors and appears to decrease in stage III and IV tumors . The authors suggest that overexpression of LGR5 / GPR49 may be an early event in tumorigenesis [ 10 ] . Furthermore , using a mouse endometrial cancer model , Sun et al . found that LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA is highly expressed in the epithelium during the initial stages of tumorigenesis , but is remarkably down - regu - lated in full - grown tumors [ 22 ] . Fan et al . postulated a function for LGR5 / GPR49 in the initiation of colorectal carcinomas [ 14 ] . This hypothesis corresponds with our finding that patients with lower - staged tumors had higher GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA levels , but earlier tumor onset . However , low expression of GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA appears to be associated with tumor progression . Low expression of GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA is correlated with poor recurrence - free survival ( P = 0 . 043 ) in STS patients and with the occurrence of late distant metastases ( P = 0 . 025 ) . Uchida et al . described diffuse LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA expression in the entire tumor , as well as in the invasive front of human colorectal carcinomas [ 20 ] . LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA expression in colorectal carcinomas correlated signifi - cantly with the number of lymph node metastases , lym - phatic invasion , and vascular invasion [ 20 ] . Moreover , the expression of LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA was significantly associated with poor prognosis for disease - free survival of colorectal cancer patients [ 11 ] . These data suggest , that LGR5 / GPR49 mRNA expression may be associated Figure 2 Kaplan - Meier analysis recurrence - free survival curves according to GPR49 Δ 5 transcript levels . Expression of GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA for 77 patients with STS was correlated with recurrence - free survival . The high and low cut - off values for GPR49 Δ 5 were > 7 . 6 × 10 - 5 and ≤ 7 . 6 × 10 - 5 zmol GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA / molecule HPRT mRNA ( P = 0 . 043 ) . Rot et al . BMC Cancer 2011 , 11 : 429 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2407 / 11 / 429 Page 5 of 7 with the malignant potential of colorectal cancer , including the appearance of metastasis [ 20 ] . Recently and in accordance to our results , Walker and colleagues described that an ablation of LGR5 induces increased invasion and anchorage - independent growth , and enhances tumourigenicity in xenografts experiments of human colorectal cancers . Suppression of LGR5 / GPR49 leads to a strong upregulation of mesenchymal genes and of genes positively regulating EMT ( Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition ) - the same genes are mark - edly downregulated upon LGR5 overexpression [ 23 ] . These findings suggest that LGR5 / GPR49 is important in restricting stem cells to their niche , and that loss of LGR5 concomitant with activated wnt signalling may contribute to the invasive phenotype of colorectal carci - nomas . These results highlight the importance of LGR5 , not simply as marker of colorectal tumor cells , but as a regulator of wnt responses , cell motility and cell - cell adhesion [ 23 ] . This fact can be of importance even for tumors of mesenchymal origin like STS . Conclusion In this study , we analyzed mRNA expression of an addi - tional stem cell - associated gene , LGR5 / GPR49 and its splice variant GPR49 Δ 5 , for its association with disease - associated and recurrence - free survival . We were able to identify GPR49 Δ 5 mRNA expression as an independent prognostic factor for STS patients . We suggest that stem - cell - associated genes play a major role in sarcoma patients ’ prognosis and , therefore , could be valuable tar - gets for future therapy . Together , our results suggest a role of GPR49 Δ 5 in tumorigenesis and tumor progres - sion of STS .
