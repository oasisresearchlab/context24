At the cellular level , ligand - bound LT β R activates the pro - inflammatory NF - κ B pathway but the detailed mechanisms regulating its signaling remain unknown . Understanding them is of high importance since LT β R and its ligands are promising therapeutic targets . Here , we studied the consequences of perturbed cellular cholesterol content on LT β R - induced NF - κ B signaling . Methods : To modulate cholesterol availability and / or level in lung carcinoma A549 and H2228 , and endothelial HUVEC cells different treatment regimens with filipin , methyl - β - cyclodextrin and simvastatin were applied . LT β R localization was studied by confocal microscopy . The activity of LT β R - induced NF - κ B pathway was assessed by measuring the levels of NF - κ B pathway inhibitor I κ B α and phosphorylation of RelA transcription factor by Western blotting . The NF - κ B transcriptional response , production of chemokines and adhesion molecules were examined by qRT - PCR , ELISA , and Western blotting , respectively . Adherence of different types of primary immune cells to epithelial A549 cells and endothelial HUVECs was measured fluorometrically . Interactions of LT β R with its protein partners were investigated by immunoprecipitation . Results : We showed that filipin - mediated sequestration of cholesterol or its depletion from the plasma membrane with methyl - β - cyclodextrin impaired LT β R internalization and potentiated LT β R - dependent activation of the canonical branch of the NF - κ B pathway . The latter was manifested by enhanced degradation of I κ B α inhibitor , elevated RelA phosphorylation , substantial increase in the expression of NF - κ B target genes encoding , among others , cytokines and adhesion molecules known to play important roles in immune response . It was followed by robust secretion of CXCL8 and upregulation of ICAM1 , that favored the adhesion of immune cells ( NK and T cells , neutrophils ) to A549 cells and HUVECs . Mechanistically , we showed that cholesterol depletion stabilized interactions of ligand - stimulated LT β R with modified forms of TRAF2 and NEMO proteins . Conclusions : Our results showed that the reduction of the plasma membrane content of cholesterol or its sequestration strongly potentiated signaling outcome initiated by LT β R . Thus , drugs modulating cholesterol levels could potentially improve efficacy of LT β R - based therapies .

Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2019 ) 17 : 171 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s12964 - 019 - 0460 - 1 Background Receptors belonging to the tumor necrosis factor recep - tor superfamily ( TNFRSF ) and their ligands have been exploited as promising therapeutic targets in the treat - ment of cancer and autoimmune diseases [ 1 – 3 ] . Lym - photoxin β receptor ( LT β R ) is a member of TNFRSF that binds lymphotoxin α 1 β 2 and LIGHT ( homologous to l ymphotoxin , exhibits i nducible expression and com - petes with HSV g lycoprotein D for binding to h erpes - virus entry mediator , a receptor expressed on T lymphocytes ) [ 4 , 5 ] . This receptor regulates a number of important processes including development of secondary lymphoid organs , such as Peyer ’ s patches [ 6 ] and lymph nodes [ 7 ] , development of natural killer ( NK ) cells [ 8 , 9 ] , compartmentalization of dendritic cells [ 10 ] and T cell afferent lymphatic migration [ 11 ] . Due to the link be - tween LT β R and immunity , LT β R and its ligands serve as an attractive target in treatment of various immuno - pathologies . Blocking of LT β R signaling was shown to exert beneficial effects in an experimental treatment of glomerulonephritis [ 12 ] , Sjögren ’ s syndrome [ 13 , 14 ] , arthritis , diabetes , inflammatory bowel disease ( reviewed in [ 15 ] ) or in human rheumatoid arthritis ( preclinical tri - als [ 1 ] ; ) . On the other hand , stimulation of LT β R - dependent pathways with LIGHT or agonistic antibody against LT β R promoted T cells infiltration into tumor , restricting its growth [ 16 , 17 ] . LT β R triggers several signaling cascades . Its stimula - tion leads to the activation of NF - κ B - and AP - 1 - dependent transcription [ 18 , 19 ] , and promotes apop - tosis [ 20 , 21 ] . The best characterized is the role of LT β R in the activation of the NF - κ B pathway that operates via NF - κ B1 ( p50 - RelA ) and NF - κ B2 ( p52 - RelB ) transcrip - tion factors , within two branches – canonical and non - canonical , respectively [ 6 , 18 ] . At the molecular level , the ligand binding leads to LT β R oligomerization and re - cruitment of adaptor proteins , tumor necrosis factor re - ceptor associated factors ( TRAF ) : TRAF2 and TRAF3 [ 20 , 22 ] that occurs within minutes . It leads to the acti - vation of an “ immediate ” – canonical branch of NF - κ B pathway and a “ delayed ” non - canonical branch . Based on the data from studies on canonical NF - κ B signaling activated by the founder of TNFRSF - tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) , binding of TRAF proteins to the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor is followed by recruit - ment of I κ B kinase ( IKK ) complex [ 23 ] consisting of catalytic IKK α and IKK β subunits and regulatory IKK γ , also known as NEMO ( NF - κ B essential modulator ) . Phosphorylation of IKK β [ 24 , 25 ] and polyubiquitylation of NEMO [ 26 ] enhances the activity of IKK complex re - sponsible for the phosphorylation of the key pathway in - hibitor I κ B α that is prerequisite for its proteasomal degradation . In consequence , I κ B α - bound NF - κ B1 di - mers are released and relocate to the nucleus where they bind to regulatory cis regions in DNA [ 27 ] . In contrast to TNFR , LT β R is able to activate also the non - canonical branch of the NF - κ B pathway [ 28 ] that involves the activa - tion of NF - κ B - inducing kinase ( NIK ) and IKK α , which phosphorylate the inhibitor p100 . Then p100 is polyubi - quitylated and processed in a proteasome - dependent manner into p52 that together with RelB drives transcrip - tion of target genes [ 29 , 30 ] . The signaling outputs initiated by receptors can be regu - lated by different factors , including local lipid composition of the surrounding membrane . The role of cholesterol , a crucial element of biological membranes , was shown in regulation of cellular signaling mediated by epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , insulin / IGF1 , or neurotrophin recep - tors , and members of TNFRSF [ 31 – 34 ] . According to one study , relocation of ligand - bound TNFR1 to lipid rafts , the plasma membrane ( PM ) micro - domains enriched with cholesterol , was crucial for the NF - κ B pathway activation [ 35 ] , whereas another study proposed that lipid raft - localized TNFR1 activated ERK2 , but not NF - κ B [ 36 ] . Dis - ruption of cholesterol - rich domains redirected TNFR1 - dependent signaling from NF - κ B towards pro - apoptotic cascades [ 35 ] . Cholesterol depletion significantly reduced the ability of another member of TNFRSF - death receptor 5 ( DR5 ) to initiate apoptosis [ 37 ] , indicating the role of cholesterol - rich micro - domains in pro - apoptotic signaling initiated by DR5 ligand TRAIL in TRAIL - sensitive non - small - cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) cells [ 38 ] . Interest - ingly , the PM domains other than lipid rafts were import - ant for TRAIL - dependent activation of NF - κ B and ERK1 / 2 in TRAIL - resistant NSCLC cells [ 38 ] . Manipulations in the cholesterol level were considered as a therapeutic strategy . In ErbB2 - positive breast cancer lovastatin , a cholesterol - lowering drug sensitized cancer cells to lapatinib and neratinib [ 34 ] . Depletion of the PM cholesterol by methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) was pro - posed as a tool in the treatment of synucleinopathies [ 39 ] or melanoma [ 40 ] . In T24 high - grade invasive urothelial cancer cells M β CD induced cell death [ 41 ] . Cyclodextrins are also considered as an effective tool to interfere with atherosclerosis pathogenesis [ 42 ] . Despite vast knowledge about a physiological role of LT β R , there is still a gap in understanding the mechanisms regulating its signaling at the cellular level . Thus identifying factors influencing the LT β R activity could create an oppor - tunity to develop novel therapeutic strategies . Here , we re - veal that cholesterol depletion activates LT β R - triggered canonical branch of the NF - κ B pathway that could consti - tute a potential strategy to improve LT β R - based therapies .

Plasmids encoding non - targeting sgRNA ( kind gift from Dr . Katarzyna Mleczko - Sanecka ) were designed based on [ 52 ] . Production of lentiviruses and infection of A549 cells were performed according to protocol described before [ 50 ] . After ten days of selection for puromycin ( 1 . 2 μ g / ml ) resistance , cells were plated in medium without antibiotic and analyzed for knock - out efficiency . Then clonal selection was performed . For each sgRNA four clones with complete knock - out were selected and pooled . Pools of clones ( equal number of cells of each clone was combined ) were used for experiments .

At least two technical repeats per experimental condi - tion were done . The expression of targets were normal - ized to the level of housekeeping genes ACTB , B2M , and GAPDH and presented as fold changes . Immunoprecipitation ( IP ) A549 cell lysates were prepared in the immunoprecipita - tion buffer ( IP buffer ) , supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails . From 250 to 500 μ g of protein was used per pull - down . Cell extracts were di - luted in IP buffer and pre - cleared for 2 h at 4 °C with goat IgG ( Sigma Aldrich ) and Protein G agarose beads ( Roche ) to deplete nonspecifically bound proteins . Then , cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C ( with con - stant agitation ) with appropriate amounts of antibodies ( 1 . 25 μ g of antibodies / 500 μ g of total protein ) , specific anti - LT β R or unspecific - control goat IgG or specific anti - TRAF2 or control mouse IgG . Immune complexes were recovered by incubation with Protein G – agarose beads at 4 °C with agitation for 2 h .

Adhesion assay A549 cells and HUVECs were seeded in a black 96 - well plate with transparent bottoms ( 655090 , Greiner bio - one ) at 5 – 10 × 10 4 cells per well , respectively in complete media 2 days before the assay . On the day of the assay cells were washed with PBS , pretreated for 1 h with 2 . 5 mM M β CD and stimulated or not for 8 ( A549 ) or 6 h ( HUVECs ) with LT α 1 β 2 in the presence of 2 . 5 mM M β CD or vehicle in medium without serum . On the same day , immune cells were stained with CFSE ( 65 – 0850 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) accordingly to the manufacturer instructions . The stained immune cells were re - suspended in RPMI or DMEM medium w / o serum ( 8 × 10 5 cells / ml ) and 100 μ l of cell suspension were loaded on A549 cells or HUVECs treated as de - scribed above . After 35 min of co - culture non - adherent immune cells were extensively washed away with serum - free DMEM medium .

In case of non - Gaussian distri - bution Mann - Whitney ( with Dunn ’ s post - hoc test ) was used . To assess the significance of differences in fold changes vs control set as 1 we used one sample t - test . The significance of mean comparison is annotated as follows : ns , non - significant ( P > 0 . 05 ) , * P ≤ 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , and * * * P ≤ 0 . 001 . Results Sequestration of cholesterol augments LT β R - dependent NF - κ B signaling and impairs LT β R internalization Previous studies revealed that human lung carcinoma A549 cells are suitable to study LT β R signaling in vitro [ 44 , 53 ] . In response to LT β R ligation these cells activate canonical NF - κ B signaling , that is manifested by degrad - ation of the pathway inhibitor I κ B α and phosphorylation of RelA at Ser536 ( P - RelA ) with the kinetics similar to that observed in other cell lines [ 54 , 55 ] . Upon 0 . 5 – 1 h of LT β R stimulation with agonistic anti - LT β R antibody ( Ago ) or lymphotoxin α 1 β 2 ( LT α 1 β 2 ) we observed a de - creased amounts of I κ B α , that returned to the basal levels within 1 . 5 h , while phosphorylation of RelA was increased through the whole stimulation period ( Add - itional file 1 : Figure S1a , b ) . To assess the role of cholesterol in the regulation of LT β R signaling , we measured the activity of the NF - κ B pathway in cells with sequestered cholesterol . To this end , we incubated A549 cells with filipin , a polyene anti - biotic that selectively binds to , and sequesters choles - terol in the PM [ 56 , 57 ] . Taking into account the kinetics of LT β R – triggered canonical NF - κ B signaling we measured its activity by assessing the status of its ef - fector proteins in cells pretreated with filipin and then stimulated with Ago for short time periods ( 0 . 5 and 1 h ) . Filipin alone had no effect on the levels of I κ B α and a minor and transient one ( only at the 0 . 5 h ) on the phos - phorylation of RelA , whereas sequestration of cholesterol by filipin significantly enhanced the NF - κ B pathway acti - vation caused by Ago ( Fig . 1a ) . This synergistic effect was observed for both I κ B α and P - RelA levels . As filipin impairs caveolae - dependent endocytosis [ 58 , 59 ] , we examined its effects on LT β R internalization . To this end , we used confocal microscopy to measure the amounts of ligand - bound receptor on vesicular structures upon 0 . 5 h stimulation with Ago in controls and in cells with cholesterol sequestered by filipin . Stimulation of cells with Ago followed by immunostaining with a secondary antibody recognizing Ago allowed tracking specifically a ligand - bound pool of the receptor . We quantitatively analyzed the microscopic images with respect to integral fluorescence intensity of LT β R - as well as EEA1 - positive vesicles ( early endosomes ) . Integral in - tensity is a parameter which reflects the amounts of a par - ticular protein in vesicular structures ( Fig . 1b ) . We noticed a substantial ( > 50 % ) reduction of integral intensity of LT β R - positive vesicles and only a minor decrease of integral inten - sity of EEA1 - positive vesicles in cells pretreated with filipin ( Fig . 1c ) . The number of LT β R vesicles was not reduced upon cholesterol sequestration ( Fig . 1c ) . It suggested that endosomes harboring LT β R are still formed but loaded with Banach - Or ł owska et al . Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2019 ) 17 : 171 Page 5 of 19 lower amounts of the receptor that is reflected by the de - crease in integral intensity of LT β R - positive structures . These data indicate that cholesterol - dependent internalization of LT β R inhibits NF - κ B signaling . Pharmacological inhibition of cholesterol synthesis activates NF - κ B signaling in LT β R - independent manner To confirm that LT β R signaling is regulated by choles - terol , we performed its chronic depletion . We cultured A549 cells for 48 h in medium containing simvastatin that inhibits HMG - CoA reductase – a key enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway [ 60 ] , in the absence of exogenous source of cholesterol . Similarly to the analysis described above , we measured the activity of canonical NF - κ B signaling in simvastatin - treated cells stimulated with Ago for short time periods ( 0 . 5 and 1 h ) . We found that simvastatin alone increased RelA phos - phorylation as well as enhanced the degradation of I κ B α . At the same time , cells treated with both simvastatin and Ago did not exhibit further enhancement of RelA Fig . 1 Sequestration of the plasma membrane pool of cholesterol by filipin enhances LT β R - triggered activity of the NF - κ B pathway and reduces internalization of the ligand - bound receptor . a Lysates of A549 cells preincubated for 0 . 5 h with filipin or vehicle and stimulated for 0 . 5 or 1 h with LT β R agonist ( Ago ) were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against the indicated proteins . Vinculin was used as a loading control . Graphs show densitometric analysis for the indicated proteins from Western blotting ( protein levels normalized to vinculin ) .

Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2019 ) 17 : 171 Page 6 of 19 phosphorylation , whereas the degradation of I κ B α was potentiated upon 1 h of stimulation ( Additional file 1 : Figure S2a ) . Next , we investigated the internalization of ligand - bound receptor upon stimulation with Ago as described above . We noticed a significant decrease of ligand - bound LT β R intern - alization in cells treated with simvastatin that was mani - fested by the reduction of both integral intensity and the number of vesicles marked with LT β R ( Additional file 1 : Figure S2b ) . Simvastatin caused general changes in the endocytic system , as demonstrated by an increase of integral intensity and the number of EEA1 - positive vesicles ( early endocytic compartments ) . We also examined the intracellu - lar pool of the receptor by immunostaining of LT β R using Ago as a primary antibody in unstimulated cells . We noticed a substantial increase of total amounts of the receptor in cells treated with simvastatin ( Additional file 1 : Figure S2c ) that was confirmed by biochemical approaches ( Additional file 1 : Figure S2d ) . The elevated levels of the protein were not caused by activation of LT Β R gene transcription as we did not found significant changes at the mRNA level ( Additional file 1 : Figure S2e ) . Since the intracellular accumulation of LT β R can stimulate the NF - κ B pathway in a ligand - independent manner [ 44 ] , we checked if the effect of simvastatin on NF - κ B signaling depended on LT β R . To this end we generated LT β R knock - out A549 cell line clones using the CRISPR / Cas9 technology and treated them with sim - vastatin . We found that inhibition of cholesterol synthe - sis activated the NF - κ B pathway to the same extent in the presence and the absence of LT β R in the cell ( Additional file 1 : Figure S3 ) . Altogether , these data allowed us to conclude that in - hibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by simvastatin im - pairs the intracellular trafficking of LT β R , affects the NF - κ B pathway activity , independently of LT β R and ex - erts pleiotropic effects such as global changes in the endocytic machinery . Acute depletion of cholesterol augments LT β R - dependent NF - κ B signaling As an alternative to simvastatin - mediated inhibition of cholesterol synthesis , we performed a spatially restricted re - duction of the cholesterol level at the PM . We employed methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) , a reagent widely used to bind and extract cholesterol from membranes [ 57 ] . We measured the activity of both : canonical and non - canonical NF - κ B pathways in cells stimulated with Ago for short ( 0 . 5 and 1 h ) or long ( 4 h ) time periods , respectively . We found that M β CD alone did not affect the activity of the canonical pathway , however it potentiated the pathway activation by Ago . This synergistic effect of M β CD and Ago on the deg - radation of I κ B α as well as on RelA phosphorylation was clearly observed upon 0 . 5 and 1 h of LT β R stimulation ( Fig . 2a ) . Conversely , M β CD did not enhance the activation of the non - canonical NF - κ B pathway by LT β R as the pro - cessing of p100 to p52 in response to the stimulation with Ago ( clearly detected upon 4 h of treatment ) remained un - changed in the presence of M β CD ( Fig . 2b ) . Analogically to the experiments described above , we inves - tigated internalization of ligand - bound LT β R upon 0 . 5 h stimulation with Ago in cholesterol - depleted cells ( Fig . 2c ) . In comparison to normal conditions ( in the presence of ve - hicle ) , treatment with M β CD substantially reduced both the integral intensity and the number of LT β R vesicles , whereas it did not affect the early endocytic compartment , as judged by EEA1 staining ( Fig . 2d ) . In parallel we assessed the intra - cellular distribution of the receptor . We found that the inte - gral intensity and the number of LT β R - positive vesicles remained unchanged upon incubation with M β CD ( Add - itional file 1 : Figure S4a , b ) . Of note , there were no changes in the amounts of EEA1 marker on the vesicles and in the number of early endosomes that confirmed data from Ago - stimulated cells . To see whether the effects observed upon M β CD treat - ment reflected specifically cholesterol depletion rather than off - target effects of M β CD , we performed add - back experi - ments with cholesterol replenishment , as shown in Fig . 3a . Briefly , cells preincubated with M β CD were challenged with cholesterol complexed with M β CD , that allowed “ refilling ” the PM with cholesterol . As a control we used cells treated with medium containing M β CD alone . Then cells were stimulated with Ago and examined with respect to NF - κ B signaling . The obtained data clearly showed that cholesterol replenishment rescued the effects observed upon cholesterol depletion . The increased phosphorylation of RelA and the enhanced degradation of I κ B α in M β CD - treated and Ago - stimulated cells returned to the level observed in Ago - stimulated cells not incubated with M β CD ( Fig . 3b ) . More - over , we examined the internalization of ligand - bound re - ceptors upon cholesterol replenishment . We found that both integral intensity and the number of vesicles harboring LT β R increased to the levels observed in cells with un - affected cholesterol content ( Fig . 3c , d ) . All these observations allow concluding that the PM chol - esterol depletion by M β CD does not affect the endocytic ma - chinery in general , or the intracellular distribution of the receptor . It restricts the internalization of a ligand - bound pool of LT β R and potentiates LT β R - dependent activation of NF - κ B signaling . Thus , we decided to continue our studies on LT β R signaling using M β CD , as a tool to alter the con - tent of the PM cholesterol . Impairment of cavin - 1 - dependent LT β R internalization is insufficient to affect the signaling outcome of the receptor As the observed changes in LT β R - triggered NF - κ B signaling correlated with changes in receptor internal - ization , we checked if reduction of LT β R endocytosis Banach - Or ł owska et al . Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2019 ) 17 : 171 Page 7 of 19 would be sufficient to activate the NF - κ B pathway . Specifically , we aimed to reduce endocytosis of the re - ceptor and check its effect on LT β R - triggered NF - κ B signaling . We silenced expression of genes encoding caveolin - 1 and cavin - 1 to block caveolae - dependent endocytosis , a route strongly dependent on cholesterol [ 61 , 62 ] . We noticed that , despite a very good knock - down efficiency , caveolin - 1 depletion did not affect the internalization of ligand - bound LT β R ( Additional file 1 : Figure S5a ) . However , depletion of cavin - 1 re - duced both integral intensity and the number of LT β R vesicles ( Additional file 1 : Figure S5b ) . Thus , we examined the NF - κ B pathway activity in cavin - 1 - deprived cells and found that the responsiveness of cells to Ago measured by the degradation of I κ B α upon 0 . 5 and 1 h of stimulation remained unchanged ( Additional file 1 : Figure S5c ) . Cumulatively , these findings suggest that the reduc - tion of LT β R internalization is not sufficient for sensitizing cells to Ago . Instead , the PM cholesterol content appears to influence LT β R - driven NF - κ B signaling .

Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2019 ) 17 : 171 Page 8 of 19 Cholesterol depletion enhances interactions between LT β R and TRAF2 and NEMO proteins Since activation of NF - κ B signaling depends on the forma - tion of a complex between the receptor and TRAF adaptors [ 20 ] , we decided to examine this binding under the condi - tions of normal and low membrane cholesterol levels . We measured the interactions between LT β R and TRAF2 in the lysates of cells stimulated for 0 . 5 h with LT α 1 β 2 in the presence or absence of M β CD . Additionally , we examined binding of TRAF2 to the receptor without stimulation . As expected , the results of immunoprecipitation assay showed no significant binding in unstimulated cells and clear inter - actions upon the receptor ligation ( Fig . 4a ) . However , we were unable to find significant differences in the amounts of TRAF2 bound to LT β R between control and cholesterol - deprived cells . In the lysates of cells stimulated with LT α 1 β 2 ( under both , normal and lowered cholesterol conditions ) we detected an additional form of TRAF2 , with higher molecular weight . Moreover , this protein was also present in LT β R co - immunoprecipitates , where its amounts were twofold higher upon incubation with M β CD in com - parison to normal condition .

Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2019 ) 17 : 171 Page 9 of 19 As we already demonstrated , cholesterol depletion strongly enhances LT β R - dependent degradation of the pathway inhibitor I κ B α . This process depends on the ac - tivity of the IKK complex , regulated by the NEMO sub - unit . Given evidence that exogenously expressed LT β R interacts with NEMO [ 63 , 64 ] we tested if this inter - action occurred between the endogenously expressed proteins and if it was sensitive to the cholesterol content of the PM . We found that stimulation of LT β R with LT α 1 β 2 led to a modification of NEMO protein that was manifested by appearance of an additional , higher mo - lecular weight , band on Western blot ( Fig . 4b ) . The amounts of a modified form of NEMO further increased under low cholesterol conditions . Since activation of the NF - κ B pathway by TNF α requires NEMO ubiquitylation [ 26 , 65 ] , we examined if the additional band on Western blot recognized by anti - NEMO antibody represented the ubiquitylated protein . Pretreatment of cells with TAK - 243 [ 66 ] , ubiquitylation inhibitor precluded appearance of modified form of NEMO in LT α 1 β 2 - stimulated cells under both , normal and low - cholesterol conditions ( Fig . 4c ) . The results of co - immunoprecipitation assay showed that specifically this form of NEMO was recruited by LT β R after stimulation with the ligand ( Fig . 4d ) . Of note , the binding between these two proteins increased in cells deprived of the PM cholesterol ( Fig . 4d ) . Moreover , we observed that appearance of this form of NEMO was TRAF2 - dependent . Silencing of TRAF2 precluded NEMO modification upon LT β R stimulation under both , normal and low - cholesterol conditions ( Fig . 4e ) .

Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2019 ) 17 : 171 Page 10 of 19 Altogether , these data show that stimulation of the re - ceptor results in modifications of TRAF2 and NEMO proteins . To the best of our knowledge , LT β R interac - tions with the modified forms of endogenously expressed TRAF2 and NEMO were not reported before . Moreover , acute depletion of cholesterol strongly en - hances these interactions . Hyper - activation of the NF - κ B pathway in cells deprived of the PM cholesterol potentiates transcriptional response to LT β R stimulation As shown so far , cholesterol depletion leads to the hyper - activation of the NF - κ B pathway in response to LT β R stimulation that was measured by the sustained degradation of the pathway inhibitor I κ B α and enhanced phosphoryl - ation of RelA . Next , we asked if the activation of the path - way resulted in a transcriptional response . Thus , we measured mRNA levels of the known NF - κ B target genes encoding : adhesion molecules ( ICAM1 , VCAM ) , regulators of the NF - κ B pathway ( NFKBIA , RELB , NFKB2 ) , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) , metalloproteinase - 9 ( MMP9 ) , and a panel of cyto - kines ( TNF , CXCL8 , CCL20 , IL6 , CXCL3 , CXCL5 , CCL5 ) that were shown to be upregulated upon LT β R stimulation in different cell lines [ 11 , 53 , 55 ] . Taking into account a strong activation of NF - κ B signaling in cells depleted of cholesterol upon short stimulation of LT β R , we measured the expression of the selected genes at an early time point . Stimulation with Ago for 1 h upregulated expression of sev - eral genes ( NFKBIA , GM - CSF , TNF , CXCL8 , CCL20 , IL6 , CXCL3 , CXCL5 ) in control cells not treated with M β CD . The levels of these transcripts were further significantly ele - vated in cells co - treated with M β CD ( Fig . 5a ) . Noteworthy , M β CD alone did not activate the expression of these genes ( except for minor effects on CXCL8 and CXCL5 ) . Consistently , we found that longer ( 4 h ) stimulation of A549 cells with Ago or LT α 1 β 2 upregulated transcrip - tion of most tested genes under normal conditions , as expected ( Fig . 5b ) . Although upon 4 h incubation M β CD alone caused minor changes in transcription of some genes , it nevertheless further potentiated ligand - dependent expression of all investigates target genes ( Fig . 5b ) . The highest increase was observed for ICAM1 , CXCL8 and CCL20 genes that were upregulated 70 – 80 fold in comparison to unstimulated control cells or about 20 – 50 fold in comparison to stimulated cells under normal cholesterol conditions . To confirm our observations , we measured the expres - sion of selected genes in another lung cancer cell line H2228 , which expresses lower levels of LT β R as com - pared with A549 cells ( Additional file 1 : Figure S6a ) . Upon 2 h of stimulation with Ago we observed a similar tendency toward strong upregulation of target gene expression in cholesterol - deprived cells ( Additional file 1 : Figure S6b ) . Our findings suggest that cells with the reduced PM cholesterol level robustly respond to LT β R stimulation with increased transcription of NF - κ B target genes . These data confirm synergistic effects of M β CD and LT β R ligand on NF - κ B signaling . LT β R stimulation in cells deprived of the PM cholesterol leads to a robust pro - inflammatory response As we noticed substantial upregulation of a pro - inflammatory response at the transcriptional level , we next examined the levels of proteins encoded by the se - lected hyper - activated genes : CXCL8 and ICAM1 that play important roles during inflammation . CXCL8 is a chemokine involved in attraction of neutrophils and T lymphocytes [ 67 ] , whereas ICAM1 is an adhesion mol - ecule that is crucial for interactions of immune cells with endothelial and epithelial cells [ 68 – 71 ] . The results of ELISA assay showed that cholesterol depletion alone in - creased secretion of CXCL8 that was further potentiated upon stimulation with Ago or LT α 1 β 2 for 4 and 8 h ( Fig . 6a , b ) . Under normal cholesterol level conditions , stimulation of A549 cells with ligands did not promote the secretion of the chemokine at these time points . However , prolonged stimulation ( 8 h ) resulted in a slight upregulation of ICAM1 protein ( Fig . 6c ) . In cells de - prived of cholesterol , administration of Ago or LT α 1 β 2 led to a significant increase in ICAM1 levels , that was 3 . 5 to 5 - times higher than in cells with normal choles - terol levels . Importantly , cholesterol depletion alone did not exert any effects on ICAM1 protein levels . To test if increased production of ICAM1 was suffi - cient to exert a physiological effect , we measured the ad - herence of various types of immune cells to epithelial A549 cells upon stimulation with LT α 1 β 2 ( for 8 h ) under normal and low cholesterol conditions along with control unstimulated conditions . We found the highest adhesion of Jurkat cells to A549 cells that were co - treated with M β CD and LT α 1 β 2 ( Fig . 6d ) . Since ICAM1 plays a crucial role in leukocyte egress from the blood stream through the endothelial barrier , we performed experiments with HUVEC endothelial cells , which were recently shown to activate a pro - inflammatory response including ICAM1 over - production and increase of interactions with immune cells upon 24 h stimulation of LT β R [ 55 ] . We examined the adherence of Jurkat , NK cells , neutrophils and T cells to HUVECs , treated ana - logically to A549 cells . After 6 h of stimulation with LT α 1 β 2 in the presence of M β CD , we found strong up - regulation of ICAM1 levels in HUVECs ( Fig . 6e ) , that was accompanied by a significant increase of adhesion of all immune cells tested ( Fig . 6f ) .

Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2019 ) 17 : 171 Page 13 of 19 Cumulatively , our findings suggest that the activation of LT β R - dependent signaling upon cholesterol depletion enhances a pro - inflammatory response and promotes in - teractions of A549 lung cancer and endothelial cells with diverse types of immune cells . Discussion Cholesterol depletion in therapies Since cytokine receptors are targets in the treatment of diverse human diseases [ 1 – 3 ] , it is of high importance to get insights into molecular mechanisms regulating their signaling potential . Recently , targeting of LT β R - triggered signaling was proposed as a strategy in treatment of can - cer resistant to PD - L1 blockade [ 17 ] . Tumor infiltration by T lymphocytes that enabled to overcome the resist - ance was enhanced by LT β R - activation resulting in over - production of chemokines and adhesion molecules . Since targeting PD - 1 / PD - L1 immune checkpoint gives promising results in patients , it is of particular interest to find a way to make cancer cells more sensitive to this therapy . The data obtained in this study shed light on the relatively poorly characterized regulation of LT β R - dependent NF - κ B signaling . We found that cells de - pleted of the PM cholesterol responded more robustly to the stimulation of the receptor with agonistic antibody or its natural ligand – lymphotoxin α 1 β 2 . This was man - ifested by more efficient degradation of the pathway in - hibitor I κ B α , increased phosphorylation of RelA , more robust transcription of NF - κ B target genes and finally increased secretion of chemokine CXCL8 and expression of adhesion molecule ICAM1 . The latter promotes adhe - sion of diverse immune cells to epithelial A549 cells and endothelial HUVECs . All these changes contribute to an inflammatory response . Our findings clearly indicate that the PM cholesterol affects the signaling outcome of LT β R . Thus hyper - activation of LT β R signaling by chol - esterol depletion could potentially improve the thera - peutic strategy and help to develop new ones . M β CD treatment was already proposed as a drug in therapy of synucleinopathies since it reduced accumula - tion of α - synuclein in the neuronal cell body and synap - ses [ 39 ] . M β CD enhanced the cytotoxic effect of tamoxifen in melanoma cells [ 40 ] and induced cell death in T24 high - grade invasive urothelial cancer cells that exhibit high basal level of cholesterol . According to our data , M β CD sensitizes cells to the stimulation of LT β R . This could be of particular importance in the develop - ment of LT β R - based therapies in cases of low respon - siveness to LT β R stimulation . Cholesterol and pro - inflammatory signaling In our study we manipulated cholesterol in diverse ways : we sequestered it with filipin or reduced its levels in a spatially restricted manner ( the PM ) with M β CD or in a systematic manner by inhibiting its synthesis with simva - statin . Filipin - mediated sequestration and M β CD - mediated depletion of cholesterol in unstimulated cells did not exert any or only very small effects on the pro - cesses that we examined . Importantly , a combination of these treatments with the receptor ligation activated pro - inflammatory NF - κ B signaling in a synergistic man - ner . Changes in the cholesterol content at the PM clearly sensitized cells for the receptor stimulation . To our sur - prise , we were unable to observe a synergistic effect of LT β R ligation and cholesterol depletion in cells treated with simvastatin . Moreover , we observed that inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis activated the NF - κ B pathway in a ligand - independent manner , that was in contrast to the results obtained in experiments employing filipin and M β CD . It is plausible that in simvastatin - treated cells the NF - κ B pathway reached almost its full activity that could not be further increased by stimulation of the receptor . Pro - inflammatory effects of a statin reported here were already documented elsewhere [ 72 , 73 ] . How - ever , the majority of the literature data point to inhibi - tory effects of statins on the NF - κ B pathway [ 74 – 77 ] . We cannot exclude that different effects of statins on pro - inflammatory signaling can be cell - type dependent . As in our experimental model simvastatin and LT β R stimulation were unable to hyper - activate the NF - κ B pathway , we did not explore the potential of cholesterol synthesis inhibition in the regulation of LT β R signaling in more details . Cholesterol and intracellular transport of the receptor In our studies we observed that all types of manipulation of cholesterol impaired LT β R internalization upon lig - and binding . Although there are many examples of a positive role of cholesterol in the regulation of endocyto - sis [ 78 – 80 ] , that support our observations , there are also contradictory data concerning the effects of statins on receptor internalization . Zhang et al . showed that lovastatin - mediated depletion of cholesterol promoted ErbB2 internalization in breast cancer cell lines [ 34 ] , that is in contrast to our data on LT β R . The explanation for the discrepancy could be the fact that different receptors localize to different micro - domains at the PM and can be internalized via diverse endocytic routes . Our data in - dicate that LT β R internalization depends to a large ex - tent , however not completely , on cholesterol . This conclusion is supported by the observation that impair - ment of caveolae - mediated endocytosis , that is largely linked to cholesterol - rich domains , reduced internaliza - tion of ligand - bound LT β R . This reduction was observed in cells depleted of cavin - 1 , which is involved in caveolae - dependent endocytosis [ 81 ] . The lack of effect on LT β R internalization upon caveolin - 1 depletion can Banach - Or ł owska et al . Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2019 ) 17 : 171 Page 14 of 19 be explained by the presence of caveolin - 2 in A549 cells , that can potentially overtake the role of caveolin - 1 . The microscopic inspections of changes caused by agents targeting cholesterol revealed that two of them , filipin and M β CD , did not affect the total levels or the cellular distribution of LT β R . In contrast , inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by simvastatin led to intracellu - lar accumulation of total LT β R , manifested by an in - creased number of LT β R - harboring vesicles as well as total amounts of the receptor . A possible explanation could be that chronic cholesterol depletion impaired se - cretion of LT β R , that remained sequestered in the trans - port vesicles on the way to the Golgi apparatus and could not reach the PM , from where under normal con - ditions it should be internalized and sent for degradation [ 50 ] . It was documented that cholesterol is important for the transport of secretory membrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi [ 82 ] . Thus , a lower molecular weight of the receptor accumulated upon sim - vastatin treatment can suggest the impairment of its transport to the Golgi compartment , where posttransla - tional modifications ( such as glycosylation ) of trans - membrane proteins take place . As simvastatin alone activated NF - κ B signaling in a ligand - and LT β R - independent manner , caused general deregulation of the endocytic machinery ( manifested by the increased num - ber of EEA1 - positive endosomes ) and likely impaired secretory transport of LT β R , we did not proceed with exploring the mechanisms of its action on LT β R in the current study . Mechanisms of cholesterol - dependent regulation of receptor activity It was already demonstrated that lowering of cholesterol levels affects the activity of a diverse set of receptors . However , the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly studied , with only a few exceptions . Pro - apoptotic effects of TRAIL acting via DR4 / 5 receptors depended on the recruitment of the DISC complex to the cholesterol - rich PM domains . Their disruption by M β CD resulted in the inhibition of TRAIL - induced caspase - 8 cleavage and cell death [ 38 ] . The PM levels of the pro - oncogenic ErbB2 receptor were shown to be positively regulated by cholesterol [ 34 ] . Cholesterol low - ering promoted internalization and lysosomal degrad - ation of ErbB2 that decreased its PM pool . Treatment with lovastatin ( inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis , al - ternative to simvastatin ) improved the therapeutic po - tential of anti - cancer drugs targeting ErbB2 , lapatinib or neratinib . Other studies showed that M β CD - mediated depletion of cholesterol sensitized cancer cells to apop - tosis by an unknown mechanism [ 83 ] . Inhibition of chol - esterol synthesis was also shown to change the structure of multiple - pass transmembrane proteins such as CD20 and glucose transporters [ 84 , 85 ] . According to the accepted model of NF - κ B signaling initiated by TNFRSF members , binding between a recep - tor and TRAF proteins is a prerequisite for the degrad - ation of the pathway inhibitor I κ B α that is indirectly dependent on the IKK complex . Here , we provide evi - dence that upon stimulation with a ligand , LT β R recruits a ubiquitylated NEMO , the IKK complex subunit . So far recruitment of NEMO to a transmembrane receptor was documented for the founder of TNFRSF family - TNFR1 [ 86 – 88 ] , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) [ 89 ] , TYRO3 , TEK and other receptor tyrosine kinases [ 90 ] . However , most of these data including the results con - cerning interactions of LT β R and NEMO [ 63 , 64 ] come from experiments employing ectopically expressed pro - teins . Additionally , we showed that the uncovered bind - ing between endogenous LT β R and modified NEMO was significantly enhanced under the low cholesterol content conditions , presumably due to increased amounts of ubiquitylated NEMO . It was shown that cholesterol depletion could promote ubiquitylation of NPC1 protein [ 91 ] . At the same time , complexes of the receptor with a modified form of TRAF2 were also more abundant under low cholesterol - in comparison to nor - mal cholesterol level conditions . It is possible that in - creased binding between LT β R and the modified forms of NEMO and TRAF2 may contribute to the observed efficient degradation of the pathway inhibitor resulting in enhanced activation of NF - κ B signaling . Nevertheless , the spatial and temporal details of the events following ligand binding to the receptor at the PM depleted of cholesterol remain unknown . One may speculate that upon cholesterol depletion the proportion of the recep - tor anchored in non - lipid rafts increases , and is more prone to recruit TRAF and NEMO proteins that activate the NF - κ B pathway . This idea is supported by a previous study showing that NEMO associates preferentially with non - lipid raft fractions of the PM and furthermore the integrity of lipid rafts is dispensable for the activation of NF - κ B by TNFR1 [ 36 ] . A similar mechanism could oper - ate for LT β R but its molecular details await further investigation .
