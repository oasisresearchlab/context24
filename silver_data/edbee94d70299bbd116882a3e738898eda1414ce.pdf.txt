In the present study , we developed a highly sensitive method ( EPISENS - M ) employing adsorption - extraction , followed by one - step RT - Preamp and qPCR . The EPISENS - M allowed SARS - CoV - 2 RNA detection from wastewater at 50 % detection rate when newly reported COVID - 19 cases exceed 0 . 69 / 100 , 000 inhabitants in a sewer catchment . Using the EPISENS - M , a longitudinal WBE study was conducted between 28 May 2020 and 16 June 2022 in Sapporo City , Japan , revealing a strong correlation ( Pearson ’ s r = 0 . 94 ) between C RNA and the newly COVID - 19 cases reported by intensive clinical surveillance . Based on this dataset , a mathematical model was developed based on viral shedding dynamics to estimate the newly reported cases using C RNA data and recent clinical data prior to sampling day . This developed model succeeded in predicting the cumulative number of newly reported cases after 5 days of sampling day within a factor of √ 2 and 2 with a precision of 36 % ( 16 / 44 ) and 64 % ( 28 / 44 ) , respectively . By applying this model framework , another estimation mode was developed without the recent clinical data , which successfully predicted the number of COVID - 19 cases for the succeeding 5 days within a factor of √ 2 and 2 with a precision of 39 % ( 17 / 44 ) and 66 % ( 29 / 44 ) , respectively . These results demonstrated that the EPISENS - M method combined with the mathematical model can be a powerful tool for predicting COVID - 19 cases , especially in the absence of intensive clinical surveillance . 1 . Introduction COVID - 19 has been monitored for tailoring infection control policy based on the severity of its prevalence . Clinical surveillance of corona - virus disease ( COVID - 19 ) tends to overlook asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic individuals who do not seek medical care , whereas envi - ronmental surveillance is a cost - effective approach for obtaining population - level and near real - time epidemiological information . Recently , wastewater - based epidemiology ( WBE ) has garnered attention as a powerful tool to predict the prevalence of COVID - 19 in a sewer catchment ( Kitajima et al . , 2020 ) , as infected individuals , including those who are asymptomatic , shed the viruses into the sewer system via human excreta ( Lavania et al . , 2022 ; Park et al . , 2021 ) and bodily fluids ( e . g . , saliva , nasal secretions ) before developing symptoms ( Gudbjarts - son et al . , 2020 ; Gandhi et al . , 2020 ) . Prediction of the prevalence through WBE is pivotal for decision - makers to prepare for imminent epidemics , especially in the absence of fully notifiable clinical surveillance . Numerous studies have attempted to estimate the COVID - 19 preva - lence or predict the subsequent outbreaks in a catchment via WBE using multiple regression models ( Tiwari et al . , 2022 ; Zulli et al . , 2022 ) , in - fectious mathematical models ( Nourbakhsh et al . , 2022 ) , or artificial intelligence ( Jiang et al . , 2022 ) . Although previous studies have re - ported the potential of WBE as a 1 - to 10 - day leading indicator of clin - ically reported cases ( Wu et al . , 2022 ; Peccia et al . , 2020 ) , the validated framework remains untested to estimate the number of infected * Corresponding author .

This is mainly because most of the previously reported models did not consider the viral shedding dynamics of COVID - 19 patients ( Jiang et al . , 2022 ; Saththasivam et al . , 2021 ) who excrete SARS - CoV - 2 for over 20 days at fluctuating concentrations , even after negative respiratory tract sample ( Miura et al . , 2021 ) . Furthermore , the performance of the pro - posed predictive models has not been thoroughly validated ( Deaver et al . , 2021 ; Nourbakhsh et al . , 2022 ) . Although the relationship be - tween C RNA and clinically reported cases might vary between infection surges due to vaccination intake proportion and / or emerging variants that change asymptomatic ratio and the amount of viral shedding , only single infection surge data was used for model testing ( Deaver et al . , 2021 ; Nourbakhsh et al . , 2022 ) . Hence , it is important to develop a mathematical model that considers viral shedding dynamics and is validated with longitudinal data , including several infection surges , for predicting COVID - 19 cases in communities . Longitudinal tracking of C RNA requires a highly sensitive method that allows for the quantification of viral RNA in wastewater collected even in low - prevalence settings . Recently , we developed a highly sensitive method for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA detection in wastewater called the EPISENS - S method , which consists of pelleting wastewater samples with low - speed centrifugation , followed by RNA extraction from the pellet , RT - preamplification , and qPCR analysis ( Ando et al . , 2022 ) . However , pelleting of samples was not always effective , especially for diluted wastewater . An adsorption - extraction method using an electronegative membrane has been shown to capture SARS - CoV - 2 in wastewater with high efficiency ( Ahmed , 2020a ; Barua , 2022 ; Haramoto et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , we postulated that electronegative membrane filtration might be a superior alternative to pelleting in the EPISENS - S method for concentrating SARS - CoV - 2 from wastewater samples containing small amount of solid . In the present study , we aimed to establish a framework for pre - dicting the number of cases from C RNA . To accomplish this , we first developed a highly sensitive method for longitudinal tracking of C RNA . This method employed a simple protocol consisting of electronegative membrane filtration , direct RNA extraction from the membrane , and one - step RT - preamplification prior to qPCR , named the Efficient and Practical Virus Identification System with Enhanced Sensitivity for Membrane ( hereafter referred to as EPISENS - M ) . This method allowed for the efficient recovery and quantification of pepper mild mottle virus ( PMMoV ) , which is used to as a fecal strength indicator ( Kitajima et al . , 2018 ) and normalizer of the C RNA ( Kim et al . , 2022 ) . Subsequently , we developed a mathematical model based on viral shedding dynamics using longitudinal WBE data , allowing for the prediction of COVID - 19 cases solely from C RNA , which was successfully validated against 2 - year new COVID - 19 cases reported by fully notifiable clinical surveillance . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Wastewater sampling Between May 28 , 2020 and June 16 , 2022 , a total of 207 untreated grab wastewater samples were collected at around 10 am weekly from two WWTPs ( 104 samples from WWTP A and 103 samples from WWTP B ) serving roughly 20 % of the population in Sapporo City ( 1 . 96 million inhabitants ) , Japan , whose age distributions are shown in Fig . S1 in the supplementary material . The catchments of the two WWTPs utilize combined sewer systems . The wastewater samples were collected in sterile plastic bottles and immediately transported to the laboratory on ice . The samples were processed within 24 h after collection . The min - imum recommended meta - information on wastewater samples is sum - marized in Table S1 . 2 . 2 . The EPISENS - M method 2 . 2 . 1 . Method description The EPISENS - M method was developed by modifying the EPISENS - S method ( Ando et al . , 2022 ) . The method is characterized by electro - negative membrane filtration capturing viruses in solid and liquid fractions of influent wastewater and direct RNA extraction from the membrane ( adsorption - extraction ) , instead of low - speed centrifugation pelleting , followed by direct RNA extraction from pellets used in the EPISENS - S method ( Fig . 1 A ) . The EPISENS - M method consists of adsorption - extraction , followed by one - step RT - Preamp and qPCR . The theoretical limit of detection ( LOD ) of the EPISENS - M method is 49 . 3 copies / L under the assumption that the recovery efficiency of viral RNA for the whole process is 100 % . 2 . 2 . 2 . Filtration and RNA extraction Wastewater samples were subjected to adsorption - extraction methods ( Ahmed , 2020a , b ) with slight modifications of buffer composition in the bead beating process . Briefly , 300 mL of untreated wastewater was sup - plemented with a final concentration of 25 mM MgCl 2 , which was then filtrated through an electronegative mixed cellulose - ester membrane ( AAWP09000 ; pore size , 0 . 8 μ m ; diameter , 90 mm ; Merck Millipore , Burlington , MA , USA ) . A quarter of the membrane was inserted into a 5 - mL PowerWater bead tube of the RNeasy PowerWater Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) containing 850 μ L of PM1 , 150 μ L of TRIzol Reagent ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , and 10 μ L of β - Mercaptoethanol ( Wako , Osaka , Japan ) . Addition of TRIzol Reagent to the PM1 buffer could improve SARS - CoV - 2 recovery efficiency from wastewater samples ( Table S2 ) . The bead beating was conducted using a Precellys 24 tissue homogenizer ( Bertin Technologies , Montigny - le - Bretonneux , France ) under the following conditions : 3 × 20 s at 10 , 000 rpm and at 15 s intervals . 450 μ L of the sample lysate from the bead beating tube was transferred to a rotor adapter ( Qiagen ) using a QIAcube Connect platform and the RNeasy PowerMicrobiome Kit ( Qiagen ) to obtain 50 μ L of RNA extract . 2 . 2 . 3 . One - step RT - Preamp and qPCR One - step reverse transcription ( RT ) - preamplification and qPCR were performed according to a previous study ( Ando et al . , 2022 ) . Briefly , 13 . 5 μ L of the RNA extract was subjected to the RT - Preamp step using the iScript TM Explore One - step PreAmp Kit ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Her - cules , CA , USA ) to obtain 30 μ L of RT - preamp product . A tenfold serial dilution of plasmid DNA containing the amplification region sequence of the qPCR assay ( CDC N1 , Integrated DNA Technologies , Coralville , IA , USA ) was included to generate a standard curve at concentrations ranging from 10 5 to 10 0 copies / RT - Preamp reaction . Nuclease - free water was used as a negative control in the RT - Preamp reaction . qPCR for SARS - CoV - 2 and PMMoV was performed in a total reaction volume of 25 μ L containing 2 . 5 μ L of the RT - Preamp product , using each primer / probe set ( Table S3 ) . Tenfold serial dilutions of gBlocks for PMMoV ( 10 1 to 10 5 copies / reaction ) suspended in molecular - grade water were used for the quantification of viral copy numbers in the PCR tubes . The slope and Y - intercept of the preamp – qPCR standard curve for SARS - CoV - 2 were - 3 . 23 and 32 . 4 , respectively . The slope and Y - intercept of the qPCR standard curve for PMMoV were - 3 . 38 and 40 . 2 , respectively . The MIQE ( Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real - Time PCR Experiments ) checklist was provided as supplementary material ( Table S4 ) . 2 . 3 . The EPISENS - S method The EPISENS - S method was conducted according to our recent report ( Ando et al . , 2022 ) ( Fig . 1 A ) . Briefly , 40 mL of influent wastewater was centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 10 min to collect wastewater solids as pellets . The supernatant was removed completely by decanting , and the resul - tant pellet was subjected to RNA extraction . Total RNA in the pellet was extracted using the RNeasy PowerMicrobiome Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , H . Ando et al . Environment International 173 ( 2023 ) 107743 3 Germany ) to obtain a final RNA extract of 50 μ L , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . One - step RT - preamplification and qPCR for SARS - CoV - 2 and PMMoV were performed as described above . 2 . 4 . Examination of the capture efficiency of membrane filtration A 300 mL of influent wastewater sample collected on May 24 , 2022 from WWTP B . A 500 mL of MilliQ water was seeded with heat - inactivated SARS - CoV - 2 ( ATCC VR - 1986HK ) and murine hepatitis virus ( MHV ) as a whole process control ( WPC ) to obtain the final con - centration of 1 . 12 × 10 5 copies / L and 4 . 34 × 10 5 copies / L , respectively . The seeded wastewater samples were supplemented with MgCl 2 to obtain a final concentration of 25 mM and filtered through the elec - tronegative membrane . Thereafter , the filtered wastewater samples supplemented with 25 mM MgCl 2 and 4 . 34 × 10 5 copies of MHV were passed through a second electronegative membrane . Both membranes inoculated with murine norovirus ( MNV ) as a molecular process control ( MPC ) were subjected to the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA with EPISENS - M , as mentioned above . The primer mixture in RT - Preamp and primer / probe sets for MHV and MNV are shown in Tables S3 and S5 . The RT - Preamp reaction for MHV and MNV is the same as that for CDC N1 . The qPCR reaction for MHV and MNV was performed under the following conditions : 50 ◦ C for 2 min and initial denaturation at 95 ◦ C for 10 min to activate the DNA polymerase , followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 ◦ C for 15 s and annealing and extension at 60 ◦ C for 60 s . The SARS - CoV - 2 capture efficiency of membrane filtration was calculated based on the copy numbers quantified by RT - qPCR as follows : CaptureEfficiency ( % ) = ( 1 (cid:0) RNAcopiesrecoveredfromsecondmembrane RNAcopiesrecoveredfromfirstmembrane ) × 100 2 . 5 . Logistic regression model A logistic regression model was used to estimate the detection probability of the EPISENS - M method for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA from wastewater when a certain number of newly reported COVID - 19 cases / 100 , 000 people in Sapporo are reported . The logistic regression model is expressed as the following equation : Log P 1 (cid:0) P = β 1 + β 2 × A Fig . 1 . ( A ) Detection flow of the EPISENS - M method and the EPISENS - S method . ( B ) Comparison of the EPISENS - M and EPISENS - S methods . Red circles and blue triangles denote observed SARS - CoV - 2 RNA and PMMoV RNA concentrations in influent wastewater , respectively ( n = 37 ) . The EPISENS - M method exhibits higher recovery of PMMoV RNA ( p < 1 . 0 × 10 - 9 , Cohen ’ s d = 1 . 56 , paired t - test ; n = 37 ) , but comparable recovery of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA ( p = 0 . 98 , Cohen ’ s d = 0 . 004 , paired t - test ; n = 34 , quantified samples used ) as compared to the EPISENS - S method .

Environment International 173 ( 2023 ) 107743 4 where P represents the detection probability , A represents the 7 - day central moving average of daily clinical confirmed cases in Sapporo City , and β 1 and β 2 are parameters . To estimate the parameters in the model , the detection results of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA from wastewater were trans - formed into binary data ( positive or negative ) . In this study , P = 1 . 0 was assumed to be only the case when SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected from wastewater collected at two WWTPs in the same week . All statistical analyses were performed in R Statistical Computing Software version 4 . 1 . 2 ( R ) and the code is shown in the Supplementary material . 2 . 6 . Development of mathematical model for reported case prediction A mathematical model , named " PRedictive Estimation of cases with Sewage - based ENhanced Surveillance ( PRESENS ) model " , was devel - oped based on the mass balance between SARS - CoV - 2 RNA shed from infected individuals that enters WWTPs in a city . The PRESENS model consists of viral shedding dynamics of the infected , newly reported COVID - 19 cases , and several constant values , described in Equation ( 1 ) : L ( t 0 ) = F × f Q × ( 1 (cid:0) AS ) ∑ X t = X (cid:0) 24 I ( t 0 + t ) × C ( (cid:0) t + X ) ( 1 ) Fig . 2 .

The circle plots denote SARS - CoV - 2 RNA concentrations in wastewater ( C RNA ) and the triangle plots denote PMMoV RNA concentrations in wastewater collected at two WWTPs . The red and blue lines denote geometric means of C RNA and PMMoV RNA concentrations , respectively . In Sapporo , less stringent countermeasures , such as declaration of a state of emergency and pre - emergency measures , were practiced three times during the study period ( i . e . , April 14 to May 31 , 2020 ; May 9 to June 11 , 2021 ; August 2 to September 30 , 2021 ) ( B ) Comparison of Pearson ’ s r values with and without normalization by PMMoV . The blue vertical bars denote the correlation coefficients between the 7 - day moving average of newly reported cases and C RNA without normalization , while the gray vertical bars represent the concentration with normalization by PMMoV . Time lag refers to the difference between the sampling day and the day set as the center date of the 7 - day moving average . PMMoV normalization did not improve the value of Pearson ’ s r . The C RNA without normalization showed the highest value of Pearson ’ s r with the 7 - day moving average centered four days after the sampling day . ( C ) Correlation of the C RNA and newly reported COVID - 19 cases / 100 , 000 inhabitants in Sapporo . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA concentration in the Y - axis refers to the geometric C RNA at two WWTPs in the same week . Newly reported COVID - 19 cases on the X - axis are made up of the 7 - day moving average centered on the 4 - day after sampling day ( Pearson ’ s r = 0 . 94 , p < 1 . 0 × 10 - 10 , quantified sample used n = 76 ) .

Environment International 173 ( 2023 ) 107743 5 where t 0 is a day in which wastewater sampling is conducted , L ( t 0 ) is SARS - CoV - 2 RNA concentration in influent wastewater ( C RNA , copies / L , ) , F is the daily amount of feces of an individual in developed countries ( 128 g - feces / person / day ) ( Rose et al . , 2015 ) ; Q is the flow rate in Sap - poro ( 10 9 L / day ) , f is the proportion of infected persons who shed SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in their feces ( 0 . 5 ) ( Lavania et al . , 2022 ; Mauro , 2022 ; Twigg and Wenk , 2022 ; Zhang et al . , 2021 ; Parasa , et al . , 2019 ) , and AS is the proportion of asymptomatic infections ( 0 . 35 ) ( Ma et al . , 2021 ; Oran and Topol , 2020 ; Alene et al . , 2021 ) . The values of f and AS were referred to in previous reports summarized in Table S6 . In the sigma function , X is the time lag ( day ) between onset of shedding viruses into WWTP considering transportation time in sewage pipeline and being reported by clinical surveillance . I ( t 0 + t ) refers to newly reported cases ( persons ) t days after sampling day , as obtained from the website of the Sapporo City Health Center ( https : / / ckan . pf - sapporo . jp / dataset / covid _ 19 _ pa - tients ) . C ( t ) is the concentration of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in feces ( copies / g - feces ) on t day of virus shedding . The virus shedding dynamics C ( t ) is referred to in previous studies ( ( Miura et al . , 2021 ; Teunis et al . , 2015 ) ) , following Equation ( 2 ) : C ( t | α , β , C 0 ) = C 0 e (cid:0) α t (cid:0) 1 (cid:0) e (cid:0) ( β (cid:0) α ) t ) ( α < β ) ( 2 ) C 0 = A α / ( β - α ) , Where A is the initial concentration of viruses and α and β are transport rates of viruses . At the onset of shedding ( t = 0 ) , the virus concentration is 0 . The infected ones shed viruses into their feces for over 20 days even after respiratory tracts test negative ( Wu et al . , 2020 ; Miura et al . , 2021 ) . In the present study , it was assumed that viral excretion continues until the 24th day of viral shedding . 2 . 7 . Estimation of parameters in the model The four parameters ( A , α , β , X ) in the model were determined by assuming maximum likelihood under the assumption that error follows normal distribution , i . e . , the least - squares method ( Wu et al . , 2022 ) . A total of 38 datasets concerning the geometric concentration in waste - water in two WWTPs in the same week and newly reported COVID - 19 cases in Sapporo from 16 October 2020 to 16 June 2021 were pro - vided for parameter estimation . These datasets were obtained when two infectious surges occurred in Sapporo . Before 15 October 2020 , SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was not detected at the two WWTPs in the same week ; thus , the wastewater - based data was not used for parameter estimation . It was assumed that the observed C RNA in two WWTPs can be subjected to direct calculation of geometric means , for the catchment population and geometric PMMoV ( i . e . , fecal strength indicator ) concentrations in each WWTP are almost the same . In the case of C RNA normalized by PMMoV , the C RNA was divided by the PMMoV concentration in the same sample and multiplied by the geometric mean PMMoV concentrations in each WTTP . The observed concentrations ( L 1 . i ) and estimated concen - trations ( L 2 . i ) based on the model and reported cases were converted to logarithms ( log 10 copies / L ) followed by parameter determination to minimize the sum of squared errors ( SSE ) ( Equation ( 3 ) ) , as follows : SSE = ∑ 38 i = 1 ( L 1 . i (cid:0) L 2 . i ) 2 ( 3 ) The parameter fitting was conducted in the Monte Carlo simulation under the conditions that simulation consists of 5 , 000 iterations and the ranges of A , α , B , X are [ 10 7 , 10 11 ] , [ 0 . 01 , 5 ] , [ 3 , 20 ] ( [ 0 , 10 ] , respec - tively . Initial parameter sets ( A , α , B , X : ( 1 ) [ 10 7 , 0 . 01 , 3 , 0 ] , ( 2 ) [ 10 11 , 5 , 20 , 10 ] , and ( 3 ) [ 10 9 , 0 . 9 , 4 . 5 , 6 ] ) were used to create a variety of starting shapes for the shedding function . The parameter determination was performed using the Oracle Crystal Ball software ( Oracle , Califor - nia , USA ) combined with Microsoft Excel . The Excel file for the parameter estimation was provided as Supplementary material . 2 . 8 . Estimation of the newly reported case in Sapporo City A total of 44 wastewaterand clinical datasets between 24 July 2021 , and 16 June 2022 were used for the validation of estimating the newly reported cases in Sapporo via WBE . These datasets include infectious surges from 24 July to October 2021 and from January to June 2022 in Sapporo City . When SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was not detected , C RNA was assumed to be the square root of the LOD of the EPISENS - M method ( 7 . 03 copies / L ) . The total of reported cases in Sapporo one day after sampling to X - 1 ( delay in clinical reporting ) days after sampling day ( s ) ( I E ( s ) ) was estimated , following the two equations ( Equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) ) that are based on the back calculation of Equation ( 1 ) and a prox - imity formula ( Supplemental Materials ) . Equation ( 4 ) employs observed C RNA ( L ( t ) ) and newly reported COVID - 19 cases reported by clinical surveillance ( I ( t ) ) , while Equation ( 5 ) uses the number of newly re - ported COVID - 19 cases estimated from observed C RNA so far ( I e ( t ) ) , instead of recent clinical data . Thus , equation ( 5 ) allows for estimating the number of newly reported cases without the recent results of clinical surveillance . In the present study , the number of COVID - 19 cases on X days after the sampling day cannot be calculated because the concen - tration in feces C ( 0 ) is 0 : I E ( t 0 ) = ∑ X (cid:0) 1 t = 1 I e ( t 0 + t ) ≅ 1 A × ( L ( t 0 ) K (cid:0) ∑ 0 t = X (cid:0) 24 I ( t 0 + t ) × C ( (cid:0) t + X ) ) ( 4 ) A = 1 X (cid:0) 1 ∑ X (cid:0) 1 t = 1 C ( X ) , K = F × f Q × ( 1 (cid:0) AS ) where t int is defined as the start date of wastewater sampling ( 28 May 2020 ) in this study . I e ( t int + n ) is the estimated number of newly re - ported COVID - 19 cases n days after t int from the measured C RNA . The estimated cases before wastewater sampling began ( I e ( X - 24 ) to I e ( 0 ) ) were assumed to be the same as the newly confirmed cases reported by clinical surveillance . The C RNA on days ( L ( t int + n ) ) for which there were no data were regarded as the same as the C RNA measured on the pre - ceding closest day . The confidence intervals were not defined because the proximity formula was used in the estimation of future reported cases , and the appropriate distribution of errors of estimating cases cannot be found . Instead , the range of estimation based on the distance from the median was provided for evaluating the accuracy of the developed model . We proposed ranges within as a factor √ 2 and 2 estimated values , since the number of infected individuals with SARS - CoV - 2 is expected to fluctuate exponentially . ⎧⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ I E ( t int + n ) = ∑ X (cid:0) 1 t = 1 I e ( ( t int + n ) + t ) ≅ 1 A × ( L ( t int + n ) K (cid:0) ∑ 0 t = X (cid:0) 24 I e ( ( t int + n ) + t ) × C ( (cid:0) t + X ) ) I e ( ( t int + n ) + 1 ) = 1 X (cid:0) 1 I E ( t int + n ) ( n = 0 , 1 , 2 , . .

Development of the EPISENS - M method The development of the EPISENS - M method began with the confir - mation that SARS - CoV - 2 could be adsorbed to electronegative mem - brane with adequately high efficiencies ( > 95 % ) for both influent wastewater and MilliQ water ( i . e . , ultrapure water ) in the presence of MgCl 2 ( Table S7 ) . To validate the newly developed EPISENS - M method to detect viral RNA from influent wastewater in comparison with the previously developed EPISENS - S method , we determined C RNA and PMMoV RNA concentrations in 37 influent wastewater samples collected at two WWTPs between 3 March 2021 and 2 June 2021 using both methods ( Fig . 1 A , B ) . PMMoV RNA was detected in all samples at concentrations of 1 . 25 × 10 8 ( range : 5 . 43 × 10 7 to 2 . 94 × 10 8 ; n = 37 ) and 5 . 05 × 10 7 ( range : 2 . 60 × 10 6 to 1 . 90 × 10 8 ; n = 37 ) copies / L determined by the EPISENS - M method and EPISENS - S method , respec - tively ( Fig . 1 B ) . The concentrations of PMMoV RNA determined by the EPISENS - M method were significantly greater than those determined by the EPISENS - S method ( p < 1 . 0 × 10 - 9 , Cohen ’ s d = 1 . 56 , paired t - test ; n = 37 ) . The positive ratios for SARS - CoV - 2 with the EPISENS - M method and the EPISENS - S method were 100 % ( 37 / 37 ) and 91 . 9 % ( 34 / 37 ) , respectively . The observed C RNA determined by the EPISENS - M method and EPISENS - S method were 1 . 98 × 10 3 ( range , 1 . 13 × 10 2 to 4 . 10 × 10 4 ; n = 37 ) and 2 . 39 × 10 3 ( range , 1 . 31 × 10 2 to 3 . 85 × 10 4 ; n = 34 ) , respectively , showing no significant difference between the two methods for the same sample set ( p = 0 . 98 , Cohen ’ s d = 0 . 004 , paired t - test ; 34 positive samples for the analysis ) . 3 . 2 . Longitudinal monitoring of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in wastewater using the EPISENS - M method To track the dynamics of C RNA in response to COVID - 19 incidence , we collected influent wastewater from two wastewater treatment plants ( WWTPs ) ( WWTP A and B ) weekly from 28 May 2020 to 16 June 2022 . We then processed the samples ( n = 207 ) with the EPISENS - M method . The service population of the two WWTPs , both of which are connected to combined sewer systems , is approximately 10 % each of the total population of Sapporo , a city with a population of 1 . 96 million . PMMoV was also quantified for all wastewater samples as a fecal strength indi - cator to normalize C RNA . PMMoV RNA was detected in all wastewater samples from WWTP A and B with mean concentrations of 8 . 12 × 10 7 ( range , 1 . 77 × 10 7 to 3 . 68 × 10 8 ; n = 104 ) and 8 . 21 × 10 7 ( range , 1 . 61 × 10 7 to 3 . 17 × 10 8 ; n = 103 ) copies / L , respectively ( Fig . 2 A ) . The PMMoV RNA concentrations were relatively stable regardless of season ( Fig . 2 A , S2A ) . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected in 163 ( 83 . 6 % ) out of 195 influent wastewater samples , and 76 pairs of samples collected from two WWTPs in the same week tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . Non - detects were observed from 28 May 2020 to 14 October 2020 , and from 27 September 2021 to 4 January 2022 , when the daily clinical confirmed cases numbered < 1 . 7 / 100 , 000 inhabitants in Sapporo City ( Fig . 2 A ) . Non detections were not always observed when less stringent countermea - sures , such as declaration of a state of emergency and pre - emergency measures , were practiced three times during the study period ( i . e . , April 14 to May 31 , 2020 ; May 9 to June 11 , 2021 ; August 2 to September 30 , 2021 ) in the city . The C RNA showed the highest correla - tion efficiency with the 7 - day moving average centered 4 days after the sampling days of newly reported cases in the city ( Pearson ’ s r = 0 . 94 , p < 1 . 0 × 10 - 10 , only quantifiable samples used ) ( Fig . 2 B , 2C ) . We also observed that normalization with PMMoV did not improve the corre - lation efficiency ( Pearson ’ s r = 0 . 93 , p < 1 . 0 × 10 - 10 , only quantifiable samples used ) ( Fig . 2 C , S2B ) . 3 . 3 . Sensitivity of the EPISENS - M method To estimate the COVID - 19 incidence levels required for the EPISENS - M method to detect SARS - CoV - 2 RNA from influent wastewater , the longitudinal wastewater data described above were analyzed using a logistic regression model . As shown in Fig . 3 A , the parameters of β 1 and β 2 in the logistic model were estimated to be (cid:0) 2 . 75 ( 95 % CI : (cid:0) 4 . 52 to (cid:0) 1 . 41 , p < 0 . 0005 ) and 4 . 01 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 09 to 6 . 83 , p < 0 . 001 ) , respectively . These estimated parameters indicated that the EPISENS - M method could detect SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in wastewater with > 50 % ac - curacy when newly reported cases exceeded 0 . 69 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 39 to 0 . 81 ) / 100 , 000 residents in Sapporo . The COVID - 19 incidence levels required for the EPISENS - M method at a certain detection probability were generally an order of magnitude lower than that of the methods used in the previous community - ( catchment size : 0 . 12 million in - habitants ) ( Hewitt et al . , 2022 ) and national - level ( catchment size : 3 . 3 – 5 . 3 million inhabitants ) ( Tiwari et al . , 2022 ; Wu et al . , 2021 ) WBE studies ( Table 1 ) . 3 . 4 . Development of a mass balance model for predicting COVID - 19 cases via WBE To estimate the newly reported COVID - 19 cases from C RNA , a mathematical model was developed based on the mass balance between the total amounts of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA shed from the infected in - dividuals and that enters WWTPs in the corresponding area . The model contains a total of 4 parameters , three of which ( α , β , A ) are associated with the fecal shedding dynamics model , with the remaining parameter ( X ) representing lag time from the onset of viral shedding into WWTP to being reported as a newly infected individual by clinical surveillance . To estimate these four parameters in the model , the maximum likelihood estimation method , assuming the normal distribution of er - rors , or the least - squares method , was applied to the datasets consisting of newly reported COVID - 19 cases and the geometric mean C RNA of the two WWTPs from 28 October 2020 to 16 July 2021 ( n = 38 ) . C RNA with or without normalization with PMMoV concentrations was used as wastewater data . The results showed that normalization of C RNA with PMMoV increased the sum of errors squared from 2 . 56 to 2 . 97 , rather than improving model fitting . Based on this result , we used C RNA without PMMoV normalization for the estimation of parameters in the following analyses . The normality of the error was confirmed by a Shapiro (cid:0) Wilk test ( p = 0 . 91 ) and a Q - Q plot ( Fig . S3 ) . The parameters of α , β , A , and X were estimated to be 0 . 939 , 4 . 22 , 1 . 68 × 10 9 , and 6 , respectively . The estimated three parameters ( α , β , A ) described an average population - level viral shedding kinetics that peaked at 2 . 44 × 10 8 copies / g - feces at 0 . 46 days post shedding onset ( DPSO ) and rapidly decreased from 1 . 81 × 10 8 copies / g - feces at 1 DPSO to 9 . 41 × 10 2 copies / g - feces at 14 DPSO ( Fig . 3 B ) . The cumulative viral shedding in feces by 5 DPSO accounted for approximately 99 % of the total cumulative viral load shed from one infection event ( Fig . 3 B ) . The determined parameter X revealed that the infected individuals start shedding the virus into the sewer on average 6 days before being reported by clinical surveillance . 3 . 5 . Prediction of the newly reported COVID - 19 cases via WBE To demonstrate the potential of WBE to understand imminent COVID - 19 cases , we estimated the total number of newly reported COVID - 19 cases over the succeeding 5 days ( i . e . , from 1 to 5 days after the sampling day ) from the developed model , viral RNA concentrations in wastewater , and recent results of clinical surveillance . The COVID - 19 cases reported 6 days after sampling day were excluded for the esti - mation because infected individuals who would be reported 6 days after sampling day are assumed to just start shedding the virus with a con - centration of 0 copies / g - feces ( C ( 0 ) = 0 ) . The geometric mean C RNA in a week and newly reported COVID - 19 cases between 23 July 2021 and 16 June 2022 ( n = 44 ) were used as the test dataset . The test results showed H . Ando et al .

The circle plots denote the empirical data . The blue line denotes the logistic regression model with a 95 % confidential interval ( gray shadow ) . From the result of Fig . 2B , a 7 - day moving average centered four days after sampling day was used for the analysis . The EPISENS - M method exhibited a detection probability of > 50 % when the number of newly reported cases / 100 , 000 inhabitants in Sapporo exceeded 0 . 69 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 39 to 0 . 81 ) . ( B ) The fecal shedding dynamics of COVID - 19 patients estimated using wastewater - based data and clinical surveillance data . The SARS - CoV - 2 RNA concentrations in feces are abundant in the early stage of infection , peaking of 2 . 44 × 10 8 copies / g - feces on 0 . 46 days post - symptom onset .

The red circle plots denote the newly confirmed cases reported by clinical surveillance . The blue line denotes the estimation values based on the developed models and the geometric C RNA at two WWTPs in the same week . When SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was not detected ( from September 30 , 2021 to December 9 , 2021 ) , the C RNA was assumed to be 7 . 03 copies / L , which corresponds to the square root of the LOD of the EPISENS - M method . The blue and gray shadows denote ranges within a factor of √ 2 and 2 estimated , respectively . ( C . 1 ) The yellow shadow represents the data area used for parameter estimation . The test result of estimation from the developed model and the data on C RNA and recent results of clinical surveillance showed that 39 % ( 17 / 44 ) and 68 % ( 30 / 44 ) of tested samples between 23 July 2021 , and 16 June 2022 ( n = 44 ) were within the blue area and the gray area , respectively . ( C . 2 ) The test result of estimation from the developed model and C RNA data showed that 41 % ( 18 / 44 ) and 75 % ( 33 / 44 ) of the tested samples between 23 July 2021 and 16 June 2022 ( n = 44 ) were within the blue area and the gray area , respectively . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was not detected from September 19 to December 9 , 2021 , which could have led to the underestimation of predicted cases . ( For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend , the reader is referred to the web version of this article . ) H . Ando et al . Environment International 173 ( 2023 ) 107743 8 that 36 % ( 16 / 44 ) and 64 % ( 28 / 44 ) of tested samples were within a factor of √ 2 and 2 estimated values , respectively , demonstrating the well precision of the model prediction ( Fig . 3 C ( 1 ) ) . We also developed a model for estimating the total number of newly reported cases without using recent data on clinical surveillance by applying the framework of the estimation model and estimated parameters above . The test results showed that 38 % ( 17 / 44 ) and 66 % ( 29 / 44 ) of tested samples were within a factor of √ 2 and 2 estimated values , respectively ( Fig . 3 C ( 2 ) ) . As an alternative approach to supplement C RNA on non - sampling days , we estimated the newly reported cases based on linear extrapolation from the slope between the C RNA on the preceding second closest day and the preceding closest day . The result of this model ( Fig . S4 in the Supplementary material ) was comparable to that of the model above ( Fig . 3 C ( 2 ) ) . 4 . Discussion We present here a framework to estimate the incidence of COVID - 19 in a community using C RNA and mathematical models . This population - level epidemiological information is valuable , especially in the absence of fully notifiable clinical surveillance , for public health authorities to make appropriate decisions to prevent viral spread of COVID - 19 . Pre - vious studies developed models for estimating the COVID - 19 incidence via WBE ; however , most of them are based on simple correlation anal - ysis and / or not subject to the validation of their estimation proficiency with long - term C RNA data including several infectious surges ( Nour - bakhsh et al . , 2022 ; Jiang et al . , 2022 ; Wu et al . , 2022 ) . Our prediction model is advantageous over these previously developed models as it takes into account mass balance of viral load between WWTPs and infected individuals according to the viral shedding mechanisms , which was then tested for the prediction performance with a year - long dataset of C RNA . To track C RNA for multiple years including low - prevalence periods , we developed the EPISENS - M method by modifying the EPISENS - S method ( Ando et al . , 2022 ) . The EPISENS - S method has been previ - ously proven to be more sensitive than the conventional PEG - qPCR method in detecting SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in wastewater ( Ando et al . , 2022 ) , but its performance can be impaired by the number of suspended solids in wastewater that are pelleted with low - speed centrifugation in the initial step of the process . To overcome this drawback , we employed electronegative membrane ( pore size of 0 . 8 μ m ) filtration instead of the low - speed centrifugation used in the EPISENS - S method , because pre - vious studies have suggested that electronegative membranes efficiently capture viruses in water with a small number of solids ( e . g . , treated wastewater , environmental water ) ( Ahmed , 2020a ; Haramoto et al . , 2009 , 2020 ) . It has also been reported that most SARS - CoV - 2 particles in wastewater are associated with solids ( Kim et al . , 2022 ; Kitamura et al . , 2021 ; Peccia et al . , 2020 ) while this is true for liquids and PMMoV ( Kitamura et al . , 2021 ) . In fact , the EPISENS - M method exhibited a comparable recovery yield of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA but more efficiently recovered PMMoV RNA in influent wastewater as compared to the EPISENS - S method ( Fig . 1 B ) . This result supports the robustness and high sensitivity of the EPISENS - M method for detecting SARS - CoV - 2 RNA together with PMMoV RNA in influent wastewater , even with a small number of solids . We demonstrated the sensitivity of the EPISENS - M method using a logistic regression model that enables the estimation of the required number of newly reported COVID - 19 cases for a method to detect SARS - CoV - 2 RNA from wastewater samples . The sensitivity of detection methods is important information for understanding COVID - 19 preva - lence , especially in low - prevalent periods ( Ahmed et al . , 2022 ) . Our result suggested that the EPISENS - M method is more sensitive than the conventional methods used in previous studies , i . e . , PEG precipitation or ultrafiltration followed by ordinary RT - qPCR ( Fig . 3 A , Table 1 ) ( Tiwari et al . , 2022 ; Wu et al . , 2021 ; Haramoto et al . , 2009 ) . Importantly , the results also indicate that continuous non - detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA from influent wastewater corresponds to less than one reported COVID - 19 case / 100 , 000 inhabitants in a catchment under fully notifiable clinical surveillance . Based on the longitudinal data on C RNA , we estimated four parame - ters ( α , β , A , X ) in the mass balance model that describe an average population - level fecal shedding dynamics of infected individuals ( Fig . 3 B ) . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA load in feces in the early stage of infection agreed with previous studies ; however , its rate of decrease in the latter stage of infection was inconsistent with previously reported data , ( Miura et al . , 2021 ; Wu et al . , 2022 ) . It should be noted that population - level fecal shedding dynamics estimated with our model can be affected by inherent community characteristics ( e . g . , ethnicity , age , clinical sur - veillance system ) ( Prasek et al . , 2022 ) and analytical approach ( e . g . , sample types , detection methods , fecal shedding models ) . Furthermore , the determined parameter showed that infected individuals start shed - ding the detectable amount of virus into the sewer for an average of 6 days before being reported by clinical surveillance , which is probably due to both the incubation time ( estimated to be 4 – 7 days ( Ejima et al . , 2021 ; Zhao et al . , 2021 ; Cheng et al . , 2021 ) ) and the reporting delay associated with the time required for clinical testing and reporting . This notion is also supported by the fact that viruses shed from infected in - dividuals before developing symptoms enter the WWTP in the corre - sponding area via sewer pipes , which can be immediately detected from wastewater samples . Our model succeeded in the early estimation ( by 5 days ) of newly reported COVID - 19 cases in several infection surges from C RNA and recent results of clinical surveillance with reasonable accuracy , which demonstrates the validity of the mass - balance model framework and estimated parameters ( Fig . 3 C ( 1 ) ) . By applying the model framework and estimated parameters , we also successfully developed the model using C RNA and estimated newly reported cases from C RNA , instead of recent clinical data ( Fig . 3 C ( 2 ) ) . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report to provide a validated framework to estimate the number of newly reported COVID - 19 cases in a catchment solely from C RNA data in several infection surges . WBE complements clinical surveillance in terms of providing an overview of the COVID - 19 pandemic status , which could be useful for public health authorities for making decisions regarding the testing strategy and movement restriction , especially Table 1 Comparison of detection probability for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA from untreated municipal wastewater .

H . Ando et al . Environment International 173 ( 2023 ) 107743 9 when new variants are emerging in a community ( Karthikeyan et al . , 2022 ) . However , it is noteworthy that the model presented in this study may underestimate the actual number of infected individuals because it was calibrated and validated with the data on the confirmed COVID - 19 cases that could be largely underestimated due to limited clinical testing and the presence of undiagnosed / unreported cases . If viral shedding dynamics of infected individuals vary in response to variant prevalence and vaccination rate that might affect the asymp - tomatic ratio , the model calibrated with data on a certain period would show poor performance in estimating the clinically confirmed cases in the subsequent infectious surge . Interestingly , the relationship between C RNA and clinically confirmed cases seemed to be maintained during the study period , even when Sapporo faced multiple SARS - CoV - 2 variants and the prevalence of vaccination intake . One of the reasons of this consistency could be the fact that Sapporo City secured sufficient clinical testing capacity by introducing the notifiable surveillance system including self - diagnosis with antigen kits , even in several infectious surges presumably caused by α , β , δ , ο variants . Conversely , the con - sistency suggested that variants had little impact on the viral shedding of the infected individuals , which is supported by a previous study reporting that viral loads in patients ’ feces are consistent between SARS - CoV - 2 variants at the logarithmic level ( Prasek et al . , 2023 ) . However , further research is required for a better understanding of the impact of vaccination intake as well as prevalent variants and testing capacity on the relationship between C RNA and the newly reported cases . Impor - tantly , our mass balance model can consider the impact of variants by adjusting the dynamics of viral shedding ( C ( t ) copies / person / day ) that may be specific to each variant . There are challenges associated with thesocial implementation of the framework proposed in the present study . First , the EPISENS - M method requires special and expensive equipment ( i . e . , a Precellys 24 tissue homogenizer , which costs approximately $ 12 , 000 ) for the bead beating step required for efficient RNA extraction from membranes ( Fig . 1 A , Table S7 ) . Further research is needed to investigate efficient RNA extraction from membranes at low initial investment . Second , we used C RNA data from two WWTPs as representative data on C RNA for the entire Sapparo City , because these sewer catchments do not correspond to the administrative wards ( i . e . , clinical data aggregation units ) of the city . Ideally , the analysis with logistic regression model and the mathematic estimation models should be performed based on the results of the relationship between C RNA and newly reported COVID - 19 cases in each sewer catchment . Next , this study used PMMoV as a normalizer of C RNA as suggested in the previous studies ( Graham et al . , 2021 ; Kim et al . , 2022 ) ; however , normalization did not always improve correlation ef - ficiency and model fitting . Previous studies have also reported that PMMoV normalization did not improve correlation efficiency at popu - lation level ( Ai et al . , 2021 ; Duvallet et al . , 2021 ; Zheng et al . , 2022 ) . These results might be due to the difference between SARS - CoV - 2 and PMMoV viral shedding , fate , and transport in sewer as well as viral RNA recovery and detection efficiencies . Finally , we successfully tracked the prevalence of COVID - 19 via WBE by using grab sampling , which might be less representative than composite sampling ( Ahmed et al . , 2022 ) . This is probably because we collected samples at a fixed time of the day ( i . e . , around 10AM ) and SARS - CoV - 2 RNA concentrations could be averaged to some extent during the transportation process in sewer and the retention process in the grit chamber of WWTPs . Grab sampling can be an inexpensive alternative to composite sampling in a relatively large sewershed under resource - limiting circumstances owing to its simplicity without requiring expensive equipment ( i . e . , autosampler ) . Additional research should examine the potential of grab sampling to gain waste - water data reflecting the COVID - 19 prevalence in a community . In conclusion , we successfully developed a highly sensitive method for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA detection in wastewater ( EPISENS - M method ) and demonstrated a high correlation between C RNA and the newly reported cases in Sapporo City , Japan based on longitudinal surveillance over two years . We also developed a mathematical model integrating viral shedding dynamics to estimate the newly reported COVID - 19 cases over the succeeding 5 days solely from C RNA data . Collectively , our results highlighted the potential of WBE to predict the number of COVID - 19 cases in a community when fully notifiable clinical surveillance is not practiced . The framework proposed in the present study is extremely useful , especially for regions with limited access to medical systems or clinical surveillance systems transitioning from notifiable clinical sur - veillance to sentinel surveillance .
