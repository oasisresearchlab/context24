However , the classroom delivery of the design process has been the focus of very few studies . Particularly , most design - based lessons use a design process model , which poses a challenge for many engineering and technology educators . Therefore , the purpose of this study was to examine the actual process of engineering design using the sequential pattern analysis method . The researchers collected ten Concurrent Think - Aloud ( CTA ) protocols from fourth grade elementary students . The collected CTA sessions were coded using Halfin’s codes , and then analyzed using the sequential pattern analysis method . The study results suggested there exist iterative patterns of design cycles when participant students were more likely to follow specific iterative sequential patterns . To better illustrate these design behaviors , the researchers created a design pattern model based on the sequential analysis . Key words : think - aloud protocol , sequential analysis , design pattern , design process model , design cognition Introduction The Next Generation Science Standards place a great emphasis on engineering design in K - 12 science education ( NGSS Lead States , 2013 ) . The adoption of the new science standards requires that elementary science classrooms implement the engineering design practice alongside science inquiry ( NRC , 2012 ) . In addition , the technology education standards , Standards for Technological Literacy ( ITEEA , 2000 ) , highlighted the use of the design approach in teaching technology and engineering . The adoption of this design approach into K - 12 classrooms provides an opportunity to build a strong STEM learning pipeline based on engineering design problem - solving . Many engineering educators agree that the design process is a key component of designing ( NRC , 2009 ) . Hales ( 1993 ) defined the design process as a “special case of ‘problem - solving’” ( p . 5 ) . To design a computer software , for instance , engineers define problems , analyze criteria and constraints , generate ideas , select the best idea , build models , and evaluate the outcomes . These procedural activities of design have led to a wide array of design process models ( Dorst & Lawson , 2009 ) . Of course , well - developed design process models help novice designers to conceptualize the structure of problem - solving as a clear , well - defined procedure . However , the danger of the problem - solving approach in engineering design is that the actual , real - world engineering design processes do not fit a fixed design process model . When teaching engineering to young students , design process models greatly influence their design behaviors . Most engineering education programs follow a design process model . The use of a design process model helps young students to follow concise and efficient problem solving process . However , the pitfall of the design process model is that students might misunderstand the design process as fixed and serial . In fact , Crismond and Adams ( 2012 ) stated that many engineering and technology educators are challenged by the use of design models because many teachers and students misunderstood the design process as linear or serial . However , there has been limited research on the process of engineering design . Atman et al . , ( 2007 ) studied how novice and expert designers behave differently when solving a design problem . Their findings suggested that expert designers engaged in more cognitive transitions and problem - oriented design strategies . Lawson ( 1979 ) compared use of design approaches between engineering and science students , and concluded that engineering students tended to utilized the solution - oriented approach , while science students preferred the problem - oriented approach . Therefore , the purpose of this study was to examine the actual processes used by elementary students’ in engineering design as representative examples of naïve designers’ cognition . The following questions guided this research : 1 . What are the most common cognitive strategies used by students engaged in engineering design ? 2 . What are the most common sequential cognitive strategic patterns used by students engaged in engineering design ? Methodology Context of the study : The context of this study is a National Science Foundation funded Math Science Targeted Partnership ( MSP ) entitled SLED ( Science Learning through Engineering Design , https : / / stemedhub . org ) . During the five years of the SLED project , the SLED team developed over 20 lessons that utilized the engineering design approach to facilitate science learning for elementary students grades three to six . The SLED project built an engineering design process model which consists of the five stages shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1 : SLED Design Process Model ( from 2015 SLED Summer Professional Development Institute Lecture Presentation , https : / / stemedhub . org ) The SLED lessons were delivered to partnership teachers with the design process model during a professional development institute . The participant teachers not only implemented the SLED lessons , but also used the SLED design process model . Once the participant teachers finished a lesson , the researchers collected think - aloud protocol with a triad of students to assess their use of problem - solving strategies using a similar design problem . The researchers collected 10 triad think - aloud protocols from the three different school sites . The study participants were three SLED partnership schools . School site # 1 is located in an emerging urban school district . In the 2014 – 15 school year , 665 students were enrolled in the school district at SLED school site # 1 . School site # 2 is in a rural - fringe school district . In the 2014 – 2015 school year , 701 students were enrolled in the school district at SLED school site # 2 . School site # 3 is in a suburban school district , and 951 students were enrolled in the 2014 - 15 school year ( see Table 1 ) . A total of 30 students were sampled in the think - aloud data collection , all students were fourth graders .

One such activity was called Slow Boat , aligned with the Indiana State science standards ( Indiana Department of Education , 2010 ) . The Slow Boat design activity was designed for fourth grade science classroom . In the Slow Boat lesson , students were asked to design and build a boat to slowly move through a water tub . The science concepts embedded in the design activity were drag , force , speed , and motion ( see Slow Boat lesson plan on https : / / stemedhub . org ) . Researchers created a transfer problem , Sled Crash , to assess how students conceptualize the engineering design of a real - world engineering design problem . The Sled Crash design problem uses the same science and engineering design concepts as the original design task . The scenario of the transfer problem was as follows : you and your friend ride a sled to go down a snow hill , but need to slow down to prevent a crash into the trees ( See Figure 2 ) . As shown in the design task , the design problem asked students to conceptualize a design solution . The design problem does not include a time limitation , but most design sessions were completed within 20 - 30 minutes without a hands - on modeling activity . Figure 2 Sled Crash design problem Coding Scheme : The study used the concurrent think - aloud protocol ( CTA ) to capture students’ cognitive thinking processes and thoughts ( Ericsson & Simon , 1993 ; van Someren , Barnard , & Sandberg , 1994 ) . After the completion of the engineering design lesson , the researchers collected a think - aloud session with a triad of students from the participant classrooms . In the CTA session , student triads were given the Sled Crash design problem and videotaped as the triad talked through design ideas . To analyze the think - aloud sessions , the researchers adopted Halfin’s codes ( 1973 ) . Halfin identified seventeen design strategies that commonly appeared in Sled Crash ! The Problem You and your friends like to go sledding down Snowball Hill . Snowball Hill is very steep , and there are trees that you always run into if the sled goes too fast . You and your friends decide you need a way to slow down your sled so that you don’t crash into the trees . You remember what you learned in the Slow Boat lesson , so you all decide to design something to slow down the sled when needed . Criteria Your way to slow the sled down must :  Increase the drag on the sled to slow it down .  Only slow down the sled when necessary—there must be a way to turn on and off .  Be safe to use on a typical snow sled . Constraints  Must use materials you could find around your home . Your Task  Describe how you would design a way to slow the sled down using what you know about drag and what you know about the design process in a fun and creative way .  Please describe aloud how you would start the design task : where would you begin ?  What types of tests would you do to make sure that your sled slows down enough ? successful practitioners’ daily work . Among Halfin’s seventeen codes , the researchers confirmed that SLED participants frequently used seven cognitive strategies ; therefore , the study used the seven codes for analyzing the CTA sessions ( as shown in Table 2 ) . Table 2 Seven Halfin ( 1973 ) Cognitive Processes Code Cognitive Strategy Definition DF Defining problem ( s ) The process of stating or defining a problem which will enhance investigation . leading to an optimal solution . AN Analyzing The process of identifying , isolating , taking apart , breaking down , or performing similar actions . PR Predicting The process of prophesying or foretelling something in advance , anticipating the future on the basis of special knowledge . QH Questions / hypotheses The process of asking , interrogating , challenging , or seeking answers related to a phenomenon or problem . DE Designing The process of conceiving , creating inventing , contriving , sketching , or planning ideas . MA Managing The process of planning , organizing , directing , coordinating , and controlling the inputs and outputs of the system . MO Modeling The process of producing or reducing an act or condition to a generalized construct in the form of a sketch , diagram , or equation Data Analysis : The cognitive patterns were presented via two approaches : 1 ) time percentage of group means used for cognitive strategies ; and 2 ) two - event transition probabilities ( Bakeman & Gottman , 1986 ; Bakeman & Quera , 2011 ) . The time percentage of group means represents how much time students dedicated to various cognitive strategies . This data allows the researchers to determine which cognitive strategies student emphasized or preferred . In addition , researchers used the sequential analysis , a systemic method to analyze the sequential patterns of two - event transitions . Analyzing two - event sequential patterns allows researchers to see how the cognitive transitions in iterative design processes occur during engineering design problem solving . The two - event transitions have been obtained from a string of continuous transition events of raw data such as DE , MO , QH , DE , MO , DE , DE , QH . Then the researchers counted two - event transition frequencies . Using this two - event transitions , the researchers calculated the expected frequencies based on the equation presented by Bakeman and Gottman ( 1986 ) ( see Equation 1 ) .

Using the expected frequency , the researchers calculated z - scores , p - values through the Haberman’ formula ( 1978 ) in presented Equation 2 . Adjusted residual ( z – score ) = (cid:1876) (cid:3045)(cid:3030) − (cid:1857) (cid:3045)(cid:3030) (cid:3493)(cid:1857) (cid:3045)(cid:3030) ( 1 − (cid:1858) ( (cid:1855) ) / (cid:1840) ) ( 1 − (cid:1858) ( (cid:1870) ) / (cid:1840) ) Equation 2 : Z - score formula In this study , the researchers used GSEQ ( Generalized Sequential ) 5 . 1 software developed by Bakeman and Quera ( 2011 ) to analyze sequential patterns of two - event transitions . The GSEQ software designed to generate numerical data of sequential analysis including observed frequency , expected frequency , z - score , and p - value . Findings and Results 1 . Common cognitive strategies In this study , the researchers collected ten think - aloud triad sessions to investigate students’ cognitive strategy patterns . To locate the cognitive strategy patterns , researchers presented the group mean percentage diagram in Figure 3 . The data shows that triads spent over 60 % of their time generating design ideas ( Designing ) , 11 % on producing design sketches ( Modeling ) , 8 % on defining the problem ( Defining problem ) , 6 % on questioning ( Questioning ) , 5 % on analyzing ( Analyzing ) , and 4 % on managing ( Managing ) . The researchers identified that triads tended to emphasize designing and modeling . Problem - space cognitive strategies , such analyzing and defining problem , were less common among the triads . Figure 3 : Group mean percentages of time spent on cognitive strategies Analyzing 5 % Designing63 % Defining problem 8 % Managing4 % Modeling 11 % Predicting3 % Questioning6 % Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics of frequency , relative frequency , and duration . The frequency counts indicate a total of 374 transitions occurred during the 10 sessions . The most frequent cognitive strategy was designing ( f ( DE ) = 156 ) ; the least frequent was defining ( f ( DF ) = 9 ) . The relative frequency represents the rate of frequencies per 10 - minute period . The rate for analyzing , for example , was 1 . 74 , which means the analyzing strategy occurred an average of 1 . 74 times per 10 minutes . The relative frequency statistics show that there was a total of 25 cognitive events per 10 minutes . The highest cognitive strategy rate was for designing ( rf ( DE ) = 10 . 43 ) ; the lowest was for defining ( rf ( DF ) = 0 . 6 ) .

Common Sequential Patterns To investigate sequential patterns of the iterative design process , the researchers conducted a sequential analysis using GSEQ 5 . 1 software ( Bakeman & Quera , 2011 ) . Table 4 demonstrates the observed frequencies for two - event sequential transitions .

This result reflects that participants often moved back and forth between designing and questioning . The second highest iteration was between designing and managing ( f ( DE→MA ) = 33 , f ( MA→DE ) = 31 ) . Representative examples of managing ( MA ) dialogues were , “So what should we do ? ” , “Then , what’s the next step ? ” , and “Why don’t we do … ? ” Moreover , the researchers confirmed that the participant students used the managing strategy as an intermediate process of generating ideas . In addition , the data shows that most iterations involved the designing cognitive strategy . Among 366 two - sequential events , 149 events were preceded by designing and 156 events began with designing . The dominant iterations of this pattern illustrate that generating design ideas does not occur in a specific design phase , but happens throughout the entire design process . To search the sequential patterns of cognitive strategies , the researchers generated adjusted residuals ( z - score ) and two - tailed probabilities ( p - value ) for the two - event sequential transitions ( See Table 5 ) . The data shows that there exist four positive patterns of sequential transition at a 0 . 05 significance level : defining to analyzing ( p ( DF→AN ) < . 01 ) , managing to defining ( p ( MA→DF ) < . 01 ) , managing to modeling ( p ( MA→MO ) < . 01 ) , and modeling to managing ( p ( MO→MA ) = . 04 ) . On the other hand , the analysis identified significantly negative patterns at the 0 . 05 level in designing to analyzing ( p ( DE→AN ) = . 01 ) , defining to designing ( p ( DF→DE ) = . 01 ) , managing to questioning ( p ( MA→QH ) = . 03 ) , and questioning to managing ( p ( QH→MA ) = . 01 ) . These significantly negative numbers imply that such two - sequential events occurred in less than 5 % probability ( 0 . 05 significant level ) .

The diagram’s circles depict different cognitive strategies , and the arrows display the transitional probabilities between two events . Figure 4 : Transitional diagram for significant patterns of cognitive strategies at . 05 level . Conclusion and Implication The study aimed to identify the common cognitive strategies and sequential patterns of engineering design processes in 4 th grade elementary students . The researchers collected ten Concurrent Think - Aloud ( CTA ) protocol sessions , and analyzed them using Halfin’s ( 1973 ) codes . To identify the common patterns of design iterations , the researchers used sequential analysis via GSEQ 5 . 1 software ( Bakeman & Gottman , 1986 ; Bakeman & Quera , 2011 ; 2015 ) . The sequential analysis allowed the researchers to identify the iterative design process patterns . The time percentages used on cognitive strategies , featured in Figure 3 andTable 3 , confirmed that participant students preferred designing and modeling strategies and less frequently used problem space strategies , such as defining problems and analyzing . As novice designers , the participants showed the same design preferences as did the subjects in Atman et al . ( 2007 ) , where novice designers allocated significantly less amount time to the problem - scoping stage than did expert designers . The dominant use of designing , over 60 % , does not indicate a poor performance in designing ; rather , this pattern implies that the participants did not utilize diverse cognitive strategies , such as questioning or predicting , which facilitate critical and creative thinking ( Dorst & Cross , 2001 ) . The results of the sequential analysis identified common patterns of cognitive strategies for two - event sequences . Figure 5 displays the significant patterns at the 0 . 05 level , which represents probabilities higher than 95 % for the two - sequential events . The data implies , for instance , when participants used a problem - defining strategy , the probability that they would use the analyzing strategy was more than 99 % ( p < 0 . 01 ) . One interesting finding from the pattern analysis was that the defining problem strategy was not directly connected to the designing strategy . Rather , the participants tended to use proxy strategies , such as analyzing or managing , before proceeding to the solution space . To better explore design thinking pathways in engineering design problem solving , the researchers built a design pattern model in Figure 5 . The model illustrates the positive probabilities from the sequential analysis results in Table 5 . Figure 5 is similar to the SLED design process model in Figure 1 . When teachers taught the SLED lesson , students usually started identifying problems in which students were prompted : “Who is the client ? ” “What are the criteria and constraints ? ” Once students defined the problem , teachers asked them to sketch out their individual design ideas . Then the students shared their individual ideas with their group . Likewise , the design pattern model in Figure 6 shows a similar approach , in which participants started with defining problem , and then used the analyzing strategy ( f ( DF→AN ) = 6 ) . Once the participants were finished analyzing , then they frequently used the designing strategy ( f ( AN→DE ) = 21 . While using the designing strategy , participants iterated through questioning ( f ( DE→QH ) = 78 , f ( QH→DE = 78 ) ) , managing ( f ( DE→MA ) = 33 , f ( MA→DE ) = 31 ) , and modeling ( f ( DE→MO ) = 18 , f ( MO→DE ) = 17 ) . In addition , the participants used the predicting strategy when generating design ideas ( f ( DE→PR ) = 11 ) . As shown in Figure 5 , the study confirmed that designing is the heart of the problem - solving process ( f ( DF ) = 146 ) . The model illustrates that designing was not only the most frequent cognitive strategy , but also played a critical role in iterations of the other cognitive strategies . The second most frequent used cognitive strategy was questioning ( f ( QH ) = 93 ) . The pathways surrounding the questioning strategy show that the participants used design inquiries for designing ( f ( QH→DE ) = 78 ) , analyzing ( f ( QH→AN = 5 ) , and predicting ( f ( QH→PR ) = 4 ) . The use of the questioning strategy informs the greater STEM community that inquiry is a common cognitive strategy for scientific investigation as well as design ( NRC , 2012 ) . Figure 5 : Design pattern model based on positive transition counts In general , a pattern implies a repeatable or predictable behavior . For example , mathematical fractal patterns inform people of the repeating shapes of trees , coast lines , and other natural phenomena . Likewise , the researchers used the sequential analysis method to search for design thinking patterns . The researchers believe that the sequential analysis results have significant implications for engineering and technology education researchers as well as educators . These findings represent the cognitive processes required for design . Bransford , Brown and Cocking ( 2000 ) noted that unveiling children’s cognitive problem - solving strategies in engineering design will help to better explore the nature of the human as a problem solver . The discoveries of this study might support the greater STEM education community to better understand how students use particular thinking pathways to solve engineering design problems . Limitation of the Study The limitation of this study was that researchers pooled ten CTA sessions into one data sample . The reason for pooling different CTAs was to identify the corresponding statistical significance . To verity the significance of sequential patterns , the data requires a sizable sample size . Haberman ( 1978 ) presented the guideline for sequential analysis that individual events in raw data should include at least 30 items . However , the study did not satisfy the required sample size in three cognitive strategies : analyzing ( f = 26 ) , defining ( f = 9 ) , and predicting ( f = 16 ) . In future studies , the researchers need to acquire a sample size large enough to satisfy this requirement . Another issue regarding the pattern analysis was pooling the human subjects . Bakeman and Gottman ( 1986 ) warned that research outcomes from pooled data should not be used to generalize human behaviors . The researchers acknowledge that these findings are not necessarily representative of the entire population . References Atman , C . J . , Adams , R . S . , Cardella , M .
