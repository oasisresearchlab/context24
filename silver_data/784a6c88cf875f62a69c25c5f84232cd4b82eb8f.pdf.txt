Jane McGlade 1 , 2 , 3 ✉ © The Author ( s ) , under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2022 The endocytic adaptor protein Numb acts as a tumor suppressor through downregulation of oncogenic pathways in multiple cancer types . The identi ﬁ cation of splicing alterations giving rise to changes in Numb protein isoform expression indicate that Numb also has tumor promoting activity , though the underlying mechanisms are unknown . Here we report that NUMB exon 9 inclusion , which results in production of a protein isoform with an additional 49 amino acids , is a feature of multiple cancer types including all subtypes of breast cancer and correlates with worse progression - free survival . Speci ﬁ c deletion of exon 9 - included Numb isoforms ( Exon9in ) from breast cancer cells reduced cell growth and prevents spontaneous lung metastasis in a mouse model . Quantitative proteome pro ﬁ ling showed that loss of Exon9in causes downregulation of membrane receptors and adhesion molecules , as well as proteins involved in extracellular matrix organization and the epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) state . In addition , exon 9 deletion caused remodeling of the endocytic network , decreased ITG β 5 surface localization , cell spreading on vitronectin and downstream signaling to ERK and SRC . Together these observations suggest that Exon9in isoform expression disrupts the endocytic traf ﬁ cking functions of Numb , resulting in increased surface expression of ITG β 5 as well as other plasma membrane proteins to promote cell adhesion , EMT , and tumor metastasis . Oncogene ( 2022 ) 41 : 2079 – 2094 ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41388 - 022 - 02225 - w INTRODUCTION NUMB encodes a cell fate determinant [ 1 ] and conserved adaptor protein [ 2 , 3 ] that regulates endocytic traf ﬁ cking and lysosomal degradation of membrane receptors such as Notch1 [ 4 ] , Integrin β 1 [ 5 ] , and E - cadherin [ 6 , 7 ] . Numb also promotes proteasomal degradation of Gli1 [ 8 ] and the stabilization of p53 [ 9 ] . Although Numb is not known to be mutated in cancer , loss of Numb protein expression has been implicated as a mechan - ism underlying oncogenic changes in Notch signaling [ 10 , 11 ] , p53 stability [ 9 , 12 , 13 ] and its characterization as a tumor suppressor . However , this conclusion has been complicated by the more recent recognition that distinct Numb isoforms may also contribute to tumorigenesis . In vertebrates , four Numb isoforms are expressed based on the alternative splicing of two cassette exons : exon 3 and exon 9 [ 14 ] ( Fig . 1A ) . The two largest isoforms ( p71 and p72 ; collectively referred to as Exon9in ) arise due to inclusion of coding exon 9 that inserts 49 amino acids in the central region of the protein . The 49 amino acid sequence encoded by exon 9 is conserved amongst vertebrates , but analysis to date has not identi ﬁ ed motifs or domains that mediate direct protein - protein interactions , and its molecular function remains unknown [ 15 , 16 ] . Numb splicing is developmentally regulated in rat and human brain [ 17 ] , mouse cerebral cortex [ 18 ] , retina [ 19 ] and pituitary gland [ 20 ] , where exon 9 is predominantly included in stem and progenitor cells and skipped in differentiated cells . Overexpression of exon 9 included Numb isoforms in mouse stem cells expands the progenitor population [ 17 , 18 ] . Conversely , the exon 9 skipped ( Exon9sk ) isoforms promote differentiation [ 17 , 18 , 21 ] . A reversal of the developmental splicing pattern , giving rise to increased exon 9 inclusion , was initially identi ﬁ ed as one of the most frequent splicing events in lung cancer [ 22 ] . Oncogenic RAS - ERK signaling has been shown to promote exon 9 inclusion and expression of Exon9in Numb isoforms in breast and lung cancer cell lines [ 23 ] . In addition , cancer associated mutations in the RBM10 splicing factor promote NUMB exon 9 inclusion to control lung cancer cell proliferation [ 24 ] . Increased inclusion of NUMB exon 9 has also been reported in several additional studies with limited sample number including cervical squamous cell carcinoma [ 25 ] , urothelial carcinoma [ 26 ] and hepatocellular carcinoma [ 27 ] suggesting that Exon9in isoform expression is a feature of multiple tumor types . In contrast to accumulating evidence that a switch in Numb exon 9 splicing occurs in cancer , how this event contributes to tumor growth and progression is poorly understood . The different functional roles of Numb protein isoforms and in particular , the mechanisms by which increased exon 9 inclusion contributes to tumorigenesis remain poorly understood . Several studies have focused on the overexpression of individual Numb isoforms and their effects on the expression of Notch target Received : 24 August 2021 Revised : 14 January 2022 Accepted : 1 February 2022 Published online : 18 February 2022 1 Department of Medical Biophysics , University of Toronto , 610 University Avenue , Toronto , ON M5G 2M9 , Canada . 2 The Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumour Research Centre , 555 University Avenue , Toronto , ON M5G 1X8 , Canada . 3 Program in Cell Biology , 555 University Avenue , Toronto , ON M5G 1X8 , Canada . 4 SPARC BioCentre , The Hospital for Sick Children , 555 University Avenue , Toronto , ON M5G 1X8 , Canada . ✉ email : jmcglade @ sickkids . ca www . nature . com / onc Oncogene 1234567890 ( ) ; , : 3 9 Start Stop 5’ 3’ NUMB gene −30 % 0 30 % % ( tumor−normal ) 60 % −60 % Mean Difference ( % ) Exon3 PSI Total Numb expression C E S C U C E C L U A D B R C A B L C A L U S C PA A D P R A D L I H CC H O L S T A DR E A D E S C A T H C A K I C H P C P G K I R P C O A D H N S C K I R C Cancer Type * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * p72 PRR PTB Ex9 3 x E 1 651 26 68 78 173 343 366 413 637 614 D P F D P F N P F PRR PTB Ex9 p71 Numb protein isoforms PRR PTB p66 p65 PRR PTB 3 x E Exon9 PSI A C B Primary Breast Tumor Subtypes 0 25 50 75 100 Total Numb expression 0 25 50 75 100 Normal breast tissue ( n = 109 ) Exon3 PSI Exon9 PSI PS I % T o t a l N u m b E x p r e ss i on % m a x LumA ( n = 524 ) LumB ( n = 194 ) Basal - like ( n = 175 ) Normal - like ( n = 38 ) Her2 ( n = 78 ) * * * * D + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 0 1 2 3 4 5 Time ( x1000 days ) P r og r e ss i on f r ee s u r v i v a l p r obab ili t y Exon9 PSI + + High Low Low ( n = 102 ) High ( n = 103 ) Breast Cancer p = 0 . 038 * 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 Total Numb Expression High Low Breast Cancer + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + p = 0 . 62 + + P r og r e ss i on f r ee s u r v i v a l p r obab ili t y 0 2 4 6 8 Time ( x1000 days ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * Fig . 1 NUMB exon 9 inclusion is increased in multiple cancer types , including all breast cancer subtypes .

The average PSI value of normal samples was subtracted from that of tumor samples ( PSI Tumor − PSI Normal ) in each cancer type to represent the percent difference in exon 9 or exon 3 PSI values . The Total Numb Expression is the average total Numb transcript level of tumor samples divided by that of normal samples in each tumor type [ ( Tumor / Normal ) − 1 ] expressed as percentage . P - values were derived using the Wilcoxon statistical test to compare tumor and normal samples of each cancer type ; a p - value less than 0 . 05 was considered signi ﬁ cant and marked by an asterisk .

D Kaplan – Meier progression - free survival curves comparing exon 9 high and low subgroups ( left ) or total Numb expression high and low subgroups ( right ) in each breast cancer subtypes . Within each subtype , patients were strati ﬁ ed into high ( top 10th percentile ) and low ( bottom 10th percentile ) subgroups based on their exon 9 PSI value or total Numb transcript level . Patient strati ﬁ cation data is shown in Supplementary Fig . S2B , F . Y . Zhang et al . 2080 Oncogene ( 2022 ) 41 : 2079 – 2094 genes [ 22 , 28 ] . However , rather than overexpression of Exon9in , a change in the ratio between the Exon9in and Exon9sk Numb isoform expression was shown to affect Numb regulation of Notch activity [ 22 ] . The latter ﬁ ndings also suggest that the expression of Exon9in may subvert the down regulatory functions of the Exon9sk isoform . Despite increasing evidence that NUMB alternative splicing contributes to cancer progression , the prevalence of isoform switching involving exon9 across cancer types and the cellular consequences of exon 9 included protein isoform expression remain important questions . Here , we analyzed NUMB splicing in primary tumor samples using The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) dataset and show that the inclusion level of NUMB exon 9 is higher in a broad range of cancer types , including all subtypes of breast cancer . Increased exon 9 inclusion level , but not total Numb expression , correlates with worse progression - free survival in breast cancer . We investigated the function of Exon9in isoforms in a human breast cancer cell line and show that exon 9 deletion reduces lung metastasis in a xenograft model and decreased cell growth in vitro . Quantitative mass spectrometry ( MS ) showed that exon 9 deletion alters the abundance of adhesion and growth factor receptors , as well as proteins involved in epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , extracellular matrix ( ECM ) organization , and the endocytic network . Furthermore , ITG β 5 surface expression , adhesion and signaling is increased in cells expressing Exon9in . Together our ﬁ ndings suggest that exon 9 inclusion disrupts Numb regulated endocytic traf ﬁ cking of adhesion molecules such as ITG β 5 , contributing to the cellular properties and proteome alterations that promote breast cancer metastasis . RESULTS NUMB exon 9 inclusion is increased in multiple cancers including primary breast tumor subtypes To investigate the prevalence of increased Exon9in isoform expression in cancer , we compared the Percent Spliced In ( PSI ) value of Numb splicing events in primary cancer tissue versus normal tissue in the 20 out of 32 cancer types from TCGA [ 29 ] which had matched normal samples ( a total of 6236 tumor samples and 686 normal tissue samples ) ( Supplementary Fig . S1A – D ) . Numb exon 9 PSI value was signi ﬁ cantly higher in 10 / 20 cancer types analyzed compared to tissue matched normal , including uterine ( average exon 9 PSI in tumor increased 44 % above average in normal ) , lung ( squamous cell carcinoma 30 % , adenocarcinoma 39 % ) , breast ( 31 % ) , bladder ( 28 % ) , pancreas ( 23 % ) , prostate ( 21 % ) , liver ( 22 % ) , bile duct ( 20 % ) , and stomach ( 14 % ) ( Fig . 1B , Supplementary Fig . S1A , D ) . Since the PSI value is independent of gene expression , the Genotype - Tissue Expres - sion ( GTEx ) database of normal tissues ( a total of 1796 normal tissue samples matched to 26 different cancer types / 6958 tumor samples ) was used for comparison with additional cancers in the TCGA dataset which had no or few matched normal tissue . Comparison of TCGA tumor to matched normal tissue from the GTEx database con ﬁ rmed increased Exon9in Numb isoform expression in 9 out of the 10 cancer types identi ﬁ ed above ( Supplementary Fig . S1D ) and additionally revealed signi ﬁ cantly higher exon 9 inclusion in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma ( 40 % increase ) , uterine carcinosarcoma ( 20 % ) , ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma ( 38 % ) and testicular germ cell tumors ( 16 % ) ( Supplementary Fig . S1D ) . In contrast , most differences in exon 3 inclusion levels were less than 10 % except for thyroid carcinoma ( reduced 10 % compared to TCGA / GTEx normal ) ( Fig . 1B , Supplementary Fig . S1B , D ) . Total expression of Numb was lower in 7 / 20 cancer types by at least 20 % , some of which overlap with the 10 cancer types with increased Exon9in , including bile duct ( reduced 31 % below normal ) , lung ( squamous cell carcinoma 48 % , adenocarcinoma 33 % ) , bladder ( 22 % ) , and liver ( 20 % ) ( Fig . 1B , Supplementary Fig . S1C , D ) . Three kidney cancer types exhibited increased total Numb transcript level including kidney chromophobe renal cell carci - noma ( KICH 39 % increase ) , renal papillary cell carcinoma ( KIRP 16 % ) and renal clear cell carcinoma ( KIRC 11 % ) . While reductions in total Numb protein expression have previously been implicated in breast cancer progression [ 10 ] , and decreased exon 3 included isoforms ( Exon3in ) in luminal subtype correlated with its ability to interact with and suppress wildtype p53 activity [ 13 ] , the changes in exon 9 usage and correlation with breast cancer progression has not been examined . Analysis of breast cancer patient subgroups ( a total of 1009 breast tumor samples and 109 normal breast tissue samples ) showed that all ﬁ ve subtypes of breast cancer exhibit upregulated exon 9 inclusion by 10 – 40 % whereas exon 3 inclusion level was lower in only the luminal subtypes ( by 11 – 13 % ) . Total Numb expression was lower in all ﬁ ve subtypes of breast cancer by 10 – 26 % ( Fig . 1C , Supplementary Fig . S1E ) . NUMB Exon 9 inclusion level correlates with poor progression - free survival in breast cancer To examine the relationship between exon 9 splicing and patient outcome , we extracted the progression - free interval ( PFI ; time to a new tumor event or death incidence ) from the TCGA Pan - Cancer Clinical Data Resource ( TCGA - CDR ) [ 30 ] for a total of 996 breast cancer patient . Due to the different levels of exon 9 inclusion in different subtypes of breast tumor , to avoid over - representation of speci ﬁ c breast cancer subtypes , we strati ﬁ ed patients based on the NUMB exon 9 inclusion level of the primary tumor in each subtype ( Supplementary Fig . S2A , B ) . A signi ﬁ cantly higher hazard ratio ( HR = 2 . 6 , p = 0 . 043 ) , indicative of decreased progression - free survival , was observed in patients with high exon 9 inclusion compared to patients with low exon 9 inclusion , using cox proportional hazards model with breast cancer subtypes as the covariate to control for differences in patient survival among breast cancer subtypes ( Supplementary Fig . S2C ) . Univariate analysis on PFI between the same exon 9 high vs low subgroups also revealed a signi ﬁ cant reduction of survival probability with increased exon 9 inclusion ( p = 0 . 038 ) suggesting that the exon 9 PSI value is a potential prognostic marker for breast cancer ( Fig . 1D left ) . Strati ﬁ cation of breast cancer patients into exon 3 high and low subgroups within each subtype revealed that low exon 3 inclusion correlates with shorter progression - free survival ( p = 0 . 047 ) ( Supplementary Fig . S2D , E ) , supporting the results obtained from an independent dataset by Colaluca et al . [ 13 ] . In contrast , there was no correlation between progression - free survival and total Numb transcript level in breast cancer using a similar approach ( Fig . 1D right , Supplementary Fig . S2F ) . Deletion of Exon9in Numb isoforms in breast cancer cells impairs cell growth Previous studies have shown that human breast cancer cell lines representing different subtypes including MDA - MB - 468 ( basal - like ) and MCF - 7 ( luminal ) express increased levels of the Numb Exon9in isoform [ 23 , 24 ] . To study the function of Numb Exon9in isoforms in breast cancer , the genomic region of exon 9 was deleted from the MDA - MB - 468 and MCF - 7 cell lines with the CRISPR / Cas9 system using three independent sets of guide RNA ( gRNA ) ( Fig . 2A ) . Exon 9 - deleted ( Ex9 - del ) MDA - MB - 468 cell pools generated had diminished expression of the Exon9in Numb isoforms but retained expression of Exon9sk isoforms at both RNA and protein level ( Fig . 2B ) . Total Numb protein levels in Ex9 - del pools were similar to control cell pools ( Ctrl ) targeted with nonspeci ﬁ c gRNA recognizing a luciferase sequence and parental cells ( Fig . 2B upper panel ) . Removal of the exon 9 containing segment was con ﬁ rmed at the genomic level and the level of exon 3 inclusion was not affected by exon 9 deletion Y . Zhang et al . 2081 Oncogene ( 2022 ) 41 : 2079 – 2094 ( Supplementary Fig . S3A ) . In addition to targeted cell pools , CRISPR / Cas9 targeting was also used to generate Ex9 - del clonal lines in MDA - MB - 468 as well as MCF7 cells . Loss of Exon9in Numb isoforms was con ﬁ rmed at the protein level ( Supplementary Fig . S3B , C ) . Targeted clones that failed to delete exon 9 were also used as controls , hereafter referred to as the negatively targeted clone ( NTC ) . To test whether the removal of Exon9in Numb isoforms leads to changes in 2D cell growth , an Alamar Blue assay was performed . Both MDA - MB - 468 and MCF7 cell doubling rates were decreased in Ex9 - del cells compared to Ctrl cells ( Fig . 2C and Supplementary Fig . S3D ) . In colony formation assays , total colony signal ( including colony number and colony size ) was reduced in Ex9 - del MDA - MB - 468 clones or pools compared to either the NTC or Luc1 control cells ( Fig . 2D , E , Supplementary Fig . S3F , G ) , and in Ex9 - del MCF7 clone compared to NTC ( Supplementary Fig . S3E ) . We also examined the effect of overexpression of the exon 9 containing Numb p72 isoform , and the exon 9 skipped p66 isoform on cell proliferation in parental MDA - MB - 468 cells ( Fig . 2F ) . Expression of the p66 Numb isoform in parental cells led to reduced cell doubling rate and colony formation compared to control , while p72 Numb overexpression had minimal effect ( Fig . 2G , H ) . The lack of change in cell growth from p72 overexpression is similar to that observed in several studies [ 22 , 24 , 27 , 31 ] , while others have reported increased cell growth from p72 overexpression [ 24 , 28 , 32 ] , suggesting that the effects observed may be dependent on the ratio of expression of the endogenous isoforms in a particular cell context .

Zhang et al . 2082 Oncogene ( 2022 ) 41 : 2079 – 2094 Exon9in Numb isoforms are required for spontaneous lung metastasis in an orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model To determine the speci ﬁ c contribution of Exon9in Numb isoforms to tumorigenic activity we injected MDA - MB - 468 control ( n = 7 ) and Ex9 - del cell pools ( n = 8 ) into the mammary fat pad ( mfp ) of NSG ( NOD / SCID / gamma ) mice ( Fig . 3A ) . Three independently targeted cell pools ( rather than clones ) were used to minimize the clonal variance . At end point , tumors were excised , and a portion was analyzed by genomic DNA ( gDNA ) PCR and immunoblot to con ﬁ rm lack of Exon9in isoform expression in Ex9 - del group tumors ( Supplementary Fig . S4A , B ) . There was no difference in the primary tumor size or weight between Ctrl and Ex9 - del group tumors ( Supplementary Fig . S4C , D ) . In contrast , spontaneous lung metastases were readily observable in the lung tissue from the Ctrl group , but not the Ex9 - del group ( Fig . 3B ) . To quantify metastases derived from the primary tumor xenograft , we optimized a human - speci ﬁ c E - cadherin antibody for immunohistochemistry ( Supplementary Fig . S4E ) . The human E - cadherin positive areas in control xenograft mouse lungs overlapped with actively dividing cells in consecutive sections stained with H & E , and the E - cadherin signal was localized at the cell membrane ( Fig . 3C , D ) . While expression of E - cadherin in primary tumor lysate was similar between Ctrl and Ex9 - del groups ( Supplementary Fig . S4F ) , areas of E - cadherin staining of lung sections was markedly reduced in the Ex9 - del group , indicative of reduced metastasis ( Fig . 3D ) . Quanti ﬁ cation of 18 sections at different levels from each lung ( Fig . 3E ) showed signi ﬁ cantly reduced total number of metastases per lung ( 479 vs 179 , p = 0 . 0033 ) in the Ex9 - del group compared to the Ctrl group . In addition , the unit size of metastases ( 9201 vs 3165 µm 2 , p = 0 . 0075 ) and percent area of metastases ( 1 . 17 % vs 0 . 13 % , p = 0 . 0373 ) was also reduced ( Fig . 3F ) . Exon9in isoforms regulate EMT and ECM protein networks Numb regulates the abundance and function of a variety of membrane receptors and non - membrane proteins through its adaptor protein function . We utilized an unbiased quantitative proteomics approach to determine the cellular effects of exon 9 deletion and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the reduced ability of exon 9 - de ﬁ cient MDA - MB - 468 cells to form spontaneous metastases . We compared the total proteomes of two Ctrl ( n = 4 ) and three independently targeted Ex9 - del cell pools ( n = 6 ) by quantitative MS using Tandem Mass Tag ( TMT ) labeled peptides ( Fig . 4A ) . A set of 5727 unique proteins were identi ﬁ ed in both samples and the differential protein abundance was determined by the relative intensities of the TMT tags . Relative expression indicated by fold change and the statistical signi ﬁ cance was compared between the two groups ( Fig . 4B ) . Total Numb expression differed by 6 . 8 % between the median signal of Ctrl and Ex9 - del replicates , and housekeeping proteins ACTB , TUBA1C and TUBB varied by only 0 – 8 % suggesting that any differences within 10 % were likely due to technical variance ( Supplementary Fig . S5A , B , Supplementary Data S1 ) . The list of differentially expressed proteins , where Ctrl vs Ex9 - del p - value was less than 0 . 05 , was subjected to pathway enrichment analysis [ 33 ] using fold change as the ranking parameter ( Fig . 4C , relative abundance of differentially expressed proteins in each sample are shown in Supplementary Fig . S5C . ) . Two metastasis related pathways , Hallmark of EMT and ECM Organization , were identi ﬁ ed among a list of protein sets signi ﬁ cantly enriched and more abundant in Exon9in presenting cells compared to Ex9 - del cells ( Fig . 4C , D , Supplementary Fig . S5D ) . Proteins involved in these two pathways were generally downregulated in the Ex9 - del group compared to Ctrl ( Supple - mentary Fig . S5D ) and their functions involve ECM receptor interaction , ECM regulation and actin binding ( Fig . 4E ) . While proteins classically associated with EMT such as E - cadherin and vimentin were not altered in Ex9 - del cells ( Supplementary Data S1 ) , loss of Exon9in isoform expression resulted in reduced abundance of multiple membrane proteins and receptors with known roles in EMT , ECM interactions as well as breast cancer progression and metastasis including ITG β 5 [ 34 ] , ITG β 4 [ 35 ] , ICAM1 [ 36 ] , NCAM1 [ 37 ] and EPHA2 [ 38 ] ( Fig . 4C – E , Supplemen - tary Fig . S5D , E ) . This interconnected group of membrane receptors , proteins involved in EMT and ECM organization is downregulated in Ex9 - del cells in keeping with the observed decreased metastatic capacity of Ex9 - del cells . Remodeling of endocytic protein network in the absence of NUMB exon 9 Numb plays pivotal roles in endocytic traf ﬁ cking of cell surface membrane proteins by clathrin - mediated endocytosis and promoting lysosomal degradation [ 2 , 4 ] . The endocytic down - regulation of membrane receptors by Numb has been pre - dominantly studied in the context of total Numb knockdown or overexpression of isoforms lacking exon 9 . Differentially expressed proteins in Ex9 - del cells include decreased levels of multiple membrane proteins ( Fig . 4C , D , Supplementary Fig . S5E ) , Fig . 2 Deletion of Numb exon 9 in breast cancer cells impairs cell growth . A Genomic deletion of NUMB exon 9 in the human breast cancer cell line MDA - MB - 468 . The gRNAs used to target the upstream ( us ) and downstream ( ds ) intronic regions ﬂ anking exon 9 of NUMB are shown . Different combinations of us and ds gRNA were used to generate 3 different Ex9 - deleted ( Ex9 - del ) pools : 911 ( us1 ds1 ) , 922 ( us2 ds2 ) and 923 ( us2 ds3 ) . Nonspeci ﬁ c gRNA against the Luciferase ( Luc ) gene were used as controls ( Ctrl ) . B The targeting ef ﬁ ciency in Ex9 - del MDA - MB - 468 pools was con ﬁ rmed by immunoblot against Numb protein ( upper blots ) and by PCR of the exon 9 region from cDNA ( lower image ) . Numb protein bands were normalized to total protein in each sample ( Coomassie - stained PVDF membrane , described in Methods [ 66 ] ) and Exon9in isoforms ( upper band ) were quanti ﬁ ed relative to total Numb ( both upper and lower bands ) . Total Numb expression was normalized against parental . C Cell growth rate of control and Ex9 - del MDA - MB - 468 cell pools was measured by Alamar Blue assay . Cell numbers were normalized to day 1 for each cell pool . The left graph shows the combined results from Ctrl ( luc1 , luc2 ) and Ex9 - del groups ( 911 , 922 , 923 ) .

Zhang et al . 2083 Oncogene ( 2022 ) 41 : 2079 – 2094 suggesting that the loss of Exon9in isoforms may restore Exon9sk mediated lysosomal degradation of cell surface proteins . To understand if loss of Exon9in resulted in changes in the endocytic protein network , we ﬁ ltered the list of differentially expressed proteins in Ctrl or exon 9 deleted cells for annotated functions in endocytosis and revealed that the abundance of proteins involved in endocytic recycling and lysosomal traf ﬁ ck - ing were differentially altered ( Fig . 4F , G ) . For example , the level of AP3 adaptor subunits , which promote lysosomal traf ﬁ cking from late endosomes and TGN [ 39 ] , are elevated in Ex9 - del cells , while proteins involved in endocytic recycling and protein secretion [ 40 – 43 ] , such as SNX4 , Rab34 , Rab4a , STX6 and AP1 adaptor subunits , are reduced . These observations are consistent with a role for Exon9in in biasing plasma membrane protein traf ﬁ cking towards recycling , while Exon9sk direct proteins to the lysosome for degradation .

Zhang et al . 2084 Oncogene ( 2022 ) 41 : 2079 – 2094 Exon9in isoforms enhance the surface level of ITG β 5 To further validate the effects of Numb exon 9 expression on selected membrane and endocytic protein abundance ( Supple - mentary Fig . S5F ) , total protein levels in lysates of Ctrl and Ex9 - del cells was analyzed by immunoblotting . Signi ﬁ cantly reduced total protein levels of ITG β 4 ( Fig . 5B , C ) , Rab34 and NCAM1 ( Supplementary Fig . S6A , B ) were observed in Ex9 - del cells . In addition , to examine cell surface levels of membrane proteins , Ctrl and Ex9 - del cells were incubated with cell - impermeable sulfo - NHS - SS - biotin and the biotinylated membrane proteins were isolated with streptavidin - sepharose and immunoblotted to determine the relative amounts of NCAM1 , ICAM1 , EphA2 , ITG β 5 and ITG β 4 ( Fig . 5A ) . Whereas exon 9 deletion had no effect on either surface or total level of the transferrin receptor TfR , the surface level of ITG β 5 ( Fig . 5B , C ) , EphA2 , and ICAM1 ( Supple - mentary Fig . 6C , D ) were signi ﬁ cantly reduced in Ex9 - del cells . The effects of exon 9 deletion on the abundance of ITG β 5 and ITG β 4 in MCF - 7 cells was also determined . Surface levels of ITG β 4 were signi ﬁ cantly reduced in the absence of exon 9 while no change in ITG β 5 was detected ( Supplementary Fig . 6E , F ) . Exon 9 deletion did not cause a reduction in the ITG β 4 and ITG β 5 mRNA levels in either MDA - MB - 468 or MCF - 7 cells con ﬁ rming that the protein abundance changes observed were not a consequence of reduced gene expression ( Supplementary Fig . 6G , H ) . Of note , expression of ITGB4 / B5 mRNA was signi ﬁ cantly upregulated in Ex9 - del MCF7 cells compared to NTC potentially masking some effects of protein downregulation . Given the increase in the abundance of ECM - associated proteins in cells expressing Exon9in Numb isoforms , we sought further validation for integrins ITG β 4 and ITG β 5 , which have known roles in cancer progression [ 34 , 44 , 45 ] . The effect of Numb p66 ( Exon9sk ) and p72 ( Exon9in ) overexpression on the levels of ITG β 5 and ITG β 4 was tested in parental MDA - MB - 468 cells . In agreement with the predicted differential isoform effects , total levels of both ITG β 5 and ITG β 4 , and the surface level of ITG β 5 were higher in cells overexpressing the exon 9 containing isoform , p72 , compared to p66 which lacks exon 9 ( Fig . 5D , E ) . As further functional validation of the differences in surface ITG β 5 , we compared the extent of cell spreading on vitronectin , the ECM ligand for ITG β 5 [ 46 ] , at 1 , 2 and 18 h following cell seeding in Ex9 - del cells ( Fig . 5F ) . Greater spreading was observed in control Exon9in expressing cells in comparison to Ex9 - del cells at early times following attachment , consistent with elevated surface expression of ITG β 5 promoting enhanced adhesion and spreading . Exon9in isoforms promote ITG β 5 clustering and downstream signaling It has been reported that α V β 5 integrin clusters with Numb in clathrin - containing ﬂ at structures referred to as plaques , lattices [ 47 , 48 ] and reticular adhesions [ 49 ] at the adhesive surface of many cell types . We used total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to compare Numb and ITG β 5 localization at areas of the plasma membrane in direct contact with substrate ( Fig . 6A ) . In both parental MDA - MB - 468 and Ctrl cells , clustering of Numb and ITG β 5 was observed both independently and together in structures / plaques within the central region of the cell . While clusters of Numb were visible in Exon9 - del cells , the abundance of ITG β 5 membrane patches and their colocalization with Numb was less apparent . We quanti ﬁ ed Numb and ITG β 5 ﬂ uorescence and in agreement with the surface biotinylation experimental results , ITG β 5 plasma membrane ﬂ uorescence intensity was signi ﬁ cantly reduced in Ex9 - del cells while Numb ﬂ uorescence intensity was unchanged ( Fig . 6B left ) . We also measured the area of the ITG β 5 clusters relative to the total cell area attached to the substratum and , similar to ﬂ uorescence intensity , this was also reduced in Ex9 - del cells ( Fig . 6B right ) , together with a decrease in the average size of the individual ITG β 5 clusters ( Fig . 6C left ) . In contrast , while there was no change in cell surface area occupied by Numb , Ex9 - del cells exhibited a small but signi ﬁ cant decrease in the average area of Numb - positive structures ( Fig . 6B right and Fig . 6C right ) . Finally , we quanti ﬁ ed the overlap between Numb and ITG β 5 structures and observed that the proportion of Numb colocalizing with ITG β 5 in plasma membrane patches was reduced in Ex9 - del cells ( Fig . 6D ) . Thus , Exon9in Numb isoforms not only promote increased surface expression of ITG β 5 but also promote clustering with Numb at structures / plaques at the adhesive surface of cells . ITG β 5 is commonly understood to in ﬂ uence outside - in signaling at focal adhesions where it regulates cell spreading partly through pSrc signaling [ 45 ] . However , it also affects signaling via its role in the formation of ﬂ at clathrin lattices / plaques [ 47 ] . Several studies have proposed that these structure may act as signaling platforms for receptors and can regulate cell proliferation through pErk signaling [ 48 , 50 ] ( Fig . 6E ) . We compared the activation status of downstream signaling proteins associated with ITG β 5 and clathrin plaques . We used phospho - speci ﬁ c antibodies to measure phosphorylation of ERK and SRC , in lysates from Ctrl and Ex9 - del tumors ( Fig . 6F ) . Phosphorylation of both ERK and SRC ( Y416 ) was decreased in Ex9 - del primary tumors . This evidence suggests that by regulating the localization and availability of integrins at the cell surface , Exon9in Numb isoforms may enhance signaling that contributes to tumor progression and metastasis . DISCUSSION The adaptor protein Numb plays essential roles in cell fate determination [ 1 ] and tumor suppression [ 10 , 11 ] . Though the existence of multiple Numb isoforms in mammals was shown more than 20 years ago [ 14 ] the majority of functional studies have relied on complete loss of function or overexpression of a single , often unspeci ﬁ ed isoform . Similarly , studies of cancer - related functions of Numb have largely focused on total Numb expression , rather than the splicing change in tumor suppression . In cancer - related studies which have examined the Exon9in and Fig . 3 Exon9in Numb isoforms are required for spontaneous lung metastasis in an orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model . A Xenograft experimental design : 3 × 10 6 MDA - MB - 468 cells were injected into the fourth pair of mammary fat pads ( mfp ) of NSG mice . For the Ctrl group ( n = 7 ) , 3 mice were injected with Luc1 and 4 mice with Luc2 cells . For the Ex9 - del group ( n = 8 ) , 3 mice were injected with 911 , 2 with 922 and 3 with 923 cell pools . At endpoint ( 12 weeks post injection ) , tumor and lung were resected and analyzed .

Zhang et al . 2085 Oncogene ( 2022 ) 41 : 2079 – 2094 Exon9sk isoform function , most have focused on Notch target expression using overexpression cell lines . In this study , we demonstrate by speci ﬁ cally deleting exon 9 in a breast cancer mouse model , without changing the total expression of Numb , that Exon9in Numb isoforms are important for the development of spontaneous metastasis , a lethal process in cancer . We showed that altered Numb exon 9 splicing regulates traf ﬁ cking and downstream signaling of the metastasis promoter and ECM - receptor , ITG β 5 . Our analysis of the TCGA and GTEx datasets reveals that increased exon 9 inclusion is a common feature of multiple cancer types and identi ﬁ es for the ﬁ rst time that NUMB exon 9 inclusion is signi ﬁ cantly increased in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma , uterine carcinosarcoma , ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma , A log2 ( FC ) − l og10 ( p ) 5727 p = 0 . 05 B Ctrl Ex9 - del −2 −1 0 1 2 1 2 3 4 5 Ctrl Ex9 - del Luc1 Luc2 911 922 923 126 N 126 C 127 N 127 C 128 N 128 C 129 N 129 C 130 N 130 C Fractionation , LC - MS / MS , Data Analysis TMT - MS C ExtracellularMatrix PlasmaMembrane ER / Golgi Actinbinding PLOD2 DST PLEC IGFBP3 TPM2 FLNA CAST ICAM1 ITGB6 ITGB5 PVR CD44 LAMC1 TGFB2 LAMA5 PLOD3 PXDN LAMB1 P4HB ADAM9 CRTAP LGALS1 THBS1 ITGB4 NCAM1 AGRN P3H2 COL12A1 COL18A1 ECM receptors / adhesion molecules Actin binding ECM component ECM modification enzymes D - log10 ( FDR ) GO t e r m s FDR = 0 . 1 0 1 2 3 Hallmark of epithelial mesenchymal transition Extracellular matrix organization Hallmark of TNFa signaling via NFkB Negative regulation of peptidase activity Post - translational protein phosphorylationER Lumen Regulation of IGF activity by IGFBP Cell surface NES 2 . 462 . 382 . 342 . 272 . 142 . 072 . 022 . 03 Size 6519371822153018 Ctrl Ex9 - del Ctrl Ex9 - del ECM Organization Hallmark of EMT NES = 2 . 03 p - val < 0 . 0001 NES = 2 . 02 p - val < 0 . 0001 Cell Surface NES = 2 . 46 p - val < 0 . 0001 Ctrl Ex9 - del E F R AB 34 S N X 4 C AV 1 VPS 13 B AP 1 M 1 R AB 4 A VPS 29 AP 3 S 2 EPS 15 A RH G E F 37 S N X 6 AP 3 B 1 A R F 1 A R F 4 Endocytic Trafficking Proteins luc1 - 1 luc2 - 1 luc1 - 2 luc2 - 2 911 - 1 922 - 1 923 - 1 911 - 2 922 - 2 923 - 2 E x 9 - de l C t r l VA M P 3 S T X 6 S T X 3 P I C A L M H I P 1 R TransGolgiNetwork T u b u l a r S o r t i ng E ndo s o m e R AB 34 AP 1 M 1 Fast recycling Endocytosis R e t r og r a d e t r a n s po r t D e g r a d a t i on AP 3 B 1 S N X 4 S N X 6 R AB 4 A VPS 29 A R F 4 EndocyticRecyclingCompartment Slow recycling AP 3 S 2 CAV1 A R F 1 VPS 13 B AP 1 M 1 S T X 3 S T X 6 S T X 6 VA M P 3 PICALM EPS15HIP1R ARHGEF37 VA M P 3 −2−1012 Expression TMT - MS ( Ex9 - del ) Relative Protein Abundance red : Increased blue : Decreased Plasma Membrane Early Endosome Late Endosome Lysosome G Y . Zhang et al . 2086 Oncogene ( 2022 ) 41 : 2079 – 2094 stomach and prostate adenocarcinoma , testicular germ cell tumors as well as across breast cancer subgroups . Our work also con ﬁ rms using larger sample size that NUMB exon 9 inclusion is upregulated in lung , cervical , bladder , pancreatic and hepatocel - lular cancer [ 22 , 25 – 27 , 51 ] . We also show that alteration in exon 3 splicing is a less common event in cancer which may be speci ﬁ cally related to its function in stabilization of wildtype p53 . Speci ﬁ cally , tumors from endocrine glands including thyroid [ 52 ] , as well as luminal breast tumors [ 13 ] are less likely to have p53 mutations , and they showed ~ 10 % reduction in exon 3 inclusion level , suggesting a potential role in these tumor types . In breast cancer , overexpression of Exon9in Numb isoforms is seen across breast cancer subtypes . While breast tumors exhibited reduced total Numb mRNA levels , we demonstrate that exon 9 inclusion level , instead of total Numb expression , is a predictor of patient outcome . This highlights the importance of Numb isoform expression ratios in breast cancer and multiple additional cancer types . Our observations also suggest that experimental overexpression of individual Numb isoforms may not accurately model Numb function depending on the cell context . For example , we observed reduced cell growth in the absence of Exon9in , but no change when Exon9in was over expressed in MDA - MB - 468 cells , which express similar amount of Exon9in and Exon9sk . One interpretation of these results is that overexpression of Exon9in may be redundant in cells that express Exon9in and Exon9sk at similar levels , while cells with a lower ratio of Exon9in / Exon9sk may respond to Exon9in overexpression . Previously , overexpression studies have shown that Exon9in and Exon9sk have differential effects on Notch target gene expression [ 18 , 21 , 53 ] . Beyond effects on Notch1 signaling the molecular mechanisms by which Exon9in isoforms promote cancer growth and progression have not been elucidated . We used quantitative proteomics and relative protein abundance to characterize the broad cellular consequences of exon 9 deletion . Our analysis revealed that the expression of Exon9in isoforms in breast cancer promotes features of EMT , as well as alterations in cell - ECM adhesion and cell surface protein abundance . The latter observation is in keeping with the known role of Numb in membrane receptor downregulation and also supports previous observations that have implicated Numb in EMT [ 54 , 55 ] . Notably , studies based on gene silencing of NUMB concluded that Numb is a negative regulator of EMT and metastasis [ 54 ] . Our ﬁ ndings suggest that the upregulated expression of Exon9in Numb isoforms in cancer cells partially phenocopies Numb loss of function , and that exon 9 inclusion is a mechanism to subvert Numb tumor suppressor function . Work by others has shown the importance of integrins and ECM interactions in multiple steps of metastatic outgrowth during cancer progression [ 56 ] . We found that loss of Exon9in Numb isoforms alters the abundance and / or the cell surface localization of ITG β 4 and ITG β 5 . ITG β 4 expression in breast cancer was demonstrated to be associated with aggressive behavior [ 35 ] . Furthermore , ITG β 4 expression in a mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis promoted proliferative signaling , tumor invasion and metastasis [ 44 ] . Similarly , ITG β 5 induces spontaneous lung metastasis through EGF activated SRC signal - ing [ 34 ] . ITG β 5 also promotes MEK - ERK and SRC - FAK signaling events in breast carcinoma cells [ 45 ] . The changes in integrin and ECM components observed in exon 9 deleted cells suggest that Exon9in expression may contribute to maintenance of ECM stiffness and integrin clustering important for tumor metastasis [ 48 , 57 ] . Notably , exon 9 deletion had more pronounced effects on the surface expression ITG β 5 in basal - like MDA - MB - 468 cells compared to MCF - 7 cells , whereas a greater change in ITG β 4 surface expression was observed in MCF - 7 cells . This may re ﬂ ect intrinsic differences in genomic , transcriptomic , and proteomic signatures between luminal and basal - like breast cancer cells or context dependent regulation of surface proteomes in these cell types . Indeed , exon 9 deletion in MCF - 7 cells caused upregulation of ITG β 4 and ITG β 5 mRNA levels which may have masked detection of protein downregulation by post - transcriptional mechanisms . The changes in integrin expression and cell spreading observed can also in ﬂ uence cell migration . Assays to compare the migration or invasion properties of MDA - MB - 468 and MCF7 with or without Exon9in expression , including scratch assays , trans - well assays on ﬁ bronectin and vitronectin , as well as chemotaxis towards 10 % FBS , did not reveal consistent differences in exon 9 deleted cells vs control ( data not shown ) . While not exhaustive , our analysis suggests that the alterations in ITG β 4 and ITG β 5 abundance observed do not result in changes in cell migration , at least in the ex vivo context . Alternatively , changes in ITG β 5 and the assembly of clathrin plaques may alter mechanotransduction in response to tissue rigidity affecting proliferation and differentiation , as has been speculated in the literature [ 48 ] . Indeed , we observed that Numb clustered with ITG β 5 in ﬂ at structures at the adhesive surface of MDA - MB - 468 cells , similar to ﬂ at clathrin lattices or plaques described by others [ 48 , 49 ] and that loss of Exon9in isoforms decreased the cluster size of both Numb and ITG β 5 , and also the expression of ITG β 5 at the cell surface . A recent study , investigating the mechanism of aV β 5 clustering in ﬂ at clathrin lattices , showed that depletion of total Numb in immortalized human Fig . 4 Quantitative proteomic analysis of exon 9 deleted cells identi ﬁ es altered abundance of cell surface receptors and proteins associated with EMT and ECM organization . A Work ﬂ ow for mass spectrometry ( MS ) experiment using TMT labeling to quantify changes in protein abundance in response to NUMB exon 9 removal . Total protein lysate from two MDA - MB - 468 Ctrl cell pools ( n = 4 ) and three Ex9 - del cell pools ( n = 6 ) were collected . Cells for two independent replicates were collected . B Volcano plot of log10 ( p - value ) versus log2 ( fold change ) . P - value was derived from t - test between 4 Ctrl replicates and 6 Ex9 - del replicates assuming equal variance with 1 tail alternative . Fold - change ( FC ) is determined by median of signal for Ctrl replicates divided by median of signal for Ex9 - del replicates for 5727 proteins identi ﬁ ed in each sample . Proteins with p - value < 0 . 05 ( above the yellow line ) were used for pathway enrichment analysis in C , with log2FC as the pre - determined ranking status . C Gene ontology ( GO ) enrichment analysis of proteins that had signi ﬁ cantly altered abundance in the whole cell proteome from Ctrl cells ( with Exon9in ) compared to Ex9 - del cells ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Signi ﬁ cantly enriched GO terms are shown ( FDR cutoff of 0 . 1 ) , with number of proteins in each term ( size ) and net enrichment score ( NES ) to the right . A positive NES score means the terms are upregulated in Ctrl cells over Ex9 - del cells .

Proteins identi ﬁ ed by TMT - MS were ﬁ ltered according to endocytic proteins with altered abundance . Proteins with a difference less than 13 % between Ctrl and Ex9 - del are not shown . G Proteins associated with endocytic recycling are less abundant in Ex9 - del MDA - MB - 468 cells compared to cells expressing Exon9in Numb isoforms . Proteins with increased ( red ) or decreased ( blue ) abundance in Ex9 - del cells , and their localization within the cellular protein traf ﬁ cking pathway are shown . Endocytic and biosynthetic compartments depicted as in Saftig and Klumperman [ 67 ] . Y . Zhang et al . 2087 Oncogene ( 2022 ) 41 : 2079 – 2094 keratinocytes also decreases ITG β 5 clustering [ 47 ] . Although it has been demonstrated that Numb PTB domain binds ITG β 5 [ 58 ] via an NPLY motif in its cytoplasmic domain [ 47 ] , there is no study comparing the effect of exon 9 on this interaction , either directly , or indirectly via other differentially associated proteins such as Eps15 / Eps15L . However , in a recent study using human keratinocytes , proximity - biotinylation of Numb by ITG β 5 tagged with the promiscuous biotin ligase , BirA * , appears to selectively label the higher molecular weight exon 9 included isoforms [ 47 ] . Further studies are required to con ﬁ rm whether Exon9in isoforms have a speci ﬁ c function in ITG β 5 clustering and the formation of clathrin lattices . Quantitative proteomics analysis also revealed that the abun - dance of endocytic proteins is altered in the absence of Exon9in Numb isoforms , in a manner that is consistent with a model in which exon 9 expression biases endocytic traf ﬁ cking in favor of recycling rather than lysosomal degradation . For example , the level of endocytic molecules EPS15 and AP3 adaptor subunits , which promote lysosomal traf ﬁ cking from late endosomes and TGN [ 39 ] , is higher in Ex9 - del cells , while proteins involved in endocytic A C B D ITGβ4 total ITGβ4 surface ITGβ5 total ITGβ5 surface Coomassie Lu c 1 Lu c 2 911 922 923 Ex9 - del Ctrl 170 130 kD 170 93 93 N o r m a li z ed E x p r e ss i on Itgβ4 Total Surface Itgβ5 Total Surface TfR Total Surface 0 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 1 . 2 1 . 6 Control Ex9 - del 0 . 6 0 . 2 1 . 0 1 . 4 * * * B Surface Biotinylation Lysis Streptavidin IP B B Total lysate Strep IP 1h r 2h r 18h r 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 1 . 1 % S p r ead i n g A r ea ( no r m a li z ed t o l u c 1 ) F Luc1 pool Luc2 pool 911 pool 923 pool Luc1 Luc2 911 923 C on t r o l E x 9 - de l Control Ex9 - del 100μm Lu c 1 Lu c 2 911 922 923 Ex9 - del Ctrl kD N o r m a li z ed E x p r e ss i on EV p66 p72 Itgβ4 Total Surface Itgβ5 Total Surface * * * * EV p72 p 66 MDA - MB - 468 Parental ITGβ5 surface 93 93 ITGβ5 total Coomassie 170 ITGβ4 total 70 Numb Strep IP Total lysate 170 ITGβ4 surface 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 E * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 2hr * * * TfR total TfR surface 93 93 Y . Zhang et al . 2088 Oncogene ( 2022 ) 41 : 2079 – 2094 recycling such as Rab34 , Rab4a and AP1 [ 40 – 43 ] , are decreased . In support of such a model , we found that exon 9 deletion reduced the cell surface levels of ICAM1 , EphA2 , ITG β 4 and ITG β 5 in breast cancer cells . In agreement with our observations , a previous study showed that overexpression of the Numb isoform p66 , which lacks exon 9 , but not the Exon9in Numb isoform p72 , decreases the surface localization of ALK in HEK293 cells [ 31 ] . Proteins involved in both clathrin - mediated and caveolae - mediated endocytosis were differentially regulated by exon 9 inclusion , suggesting that Numb exon 9 may also in ﬂ uence the cell surface levels of proteins by regulating their internalization . Of particular relevance is caveolin ( CAV1 ) , an integral membrane protein important in the formation of caveolae , clathrin - independent plasma membrane invaginations involved in a number of cellular functions including endocytosis , transcytosis , signaling and mechano - sensing [ 59 , 60 ] . Cav1 expression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis [ 61 ] and in the breast cancer cell line MDA - MB - 231 it regulates MT1 - MMP - dependent ECM degradation [ 62 ] . The molecular basis for the differential function of exon9in isoforms in endocytic traf ﬁ cking remains unresolved . Previously , quantitative MS to compare the protein interactions as well as the phosphorylation status of Numb isoforms with or without exon 9 [ 15 , 16 ] . While these studies did not identify novel exon 9 interacting proteins , they showed that certain endocytic factors ( such as Eps15 and AP - 2 subunits ) have a preference for the exon 9 included isoforms , although this was not found to be a consequence of direct interaction with exon 9 sequences . The lack of precision medicine options for patients with basal - like breast tumors or metastatic disease has fostered efforts to discover actionable molecular targets [ 63 ] . The remodeling of protein expression patterns resulting from the alternative splicing of NUMB in breast cancer cells may provide opportunities for the development of novel targeted cancer therapies . For example , strategies to target the elevated surface ITG β 5 or other surface proteins , or the associated downstream signaling in tumor cells with high exon 9 inclusion may have potential to diminish tumor metastases . In addition , elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate NUMB exon 9 splicing , such as MEK / ERK signaling [ 23 ] , could identify strategies to suppress exon 9 inclusion and restore the down regulatory function of Numb . METHODSTCGAand GTEx RNA - seq data analysis Alternative splicing analysis was conducted on RNA - sequencing ( RNAseq ) samples from TCGA and GTEx databases [ 29 ] . The PSI values for NUMB exon 9 ( chr14 : 73745988 – 73746132 ) and exon 3 ( chr14 : 73783097 – 73783130 ) were extracted from the Supplementary Tables . The coordinates are relative to GRCh73 / hg19 human genome assembly . The raw read counts of all aligned genes were downloaded from the supplementary data portal . TCGA and GTEx samples were categorized into different cancer studies and tissue types using sample metadata supplied on the TCGA and GTEx websites . A two - sided unpaired Wilcoxon test was used to test statistical signi ﬁ cance of the difference of the PSI value between tumor and normal samples . The TCGA and GTEx raw gene readcounts datasets were combined and normalized using the DESeq2 ( version 1 . 24 . 0 ) R package . A Wilcoxon test was applied to measure statistical signi ﬁ cance of the difference between overall Numb expression in tumor and normal samples within each cancer type .

Cell lines were authenticated based on STR pro ﬁ ling using services from The Centre for Applied Genomics in SickKids . The cultures were maintained at 37 °C humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere with ( MCF7 ) or without ( MDA - MB - 468 ) CO 2 and regularly tested for Mycoplasma using SickKids Mycoplasma PCR Cell Line testing service . Cell lines were cultured for no more than 8 culture passages or 2 months . NUMB exon 9 targeting Guide RNA ( gRNA ) were designed using tools from crispr . mit . edu ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . gRNA oligo were cloned into the pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - GFP ( PX458 ) plasmid [ 64 ] . The ﬁ nal vectors with different combination of gRNAs were transfected into MDA - MB - 468 or MCF7 breast cancer cell lines . GFP positive cells were sorted and collected at the SickKids — UHN ﬂ ow cytometry facility . The targeted pool of cells was either expanded as a pool or seeded at one cell per well in 96 well plates for clonal expansion . Lysates from both pools and clones were collected and analyzed for the expression of speci ﬁ c isoforms . Generation of Numb isoform overexpression cell lines MDA - MB - 468 human breast cancer cells were transfected with pcDNA3 . 1 ( empty vector ) , pcDNA3 . 1 - p72 or pcDNA3 . 1 - p66 human Numb cDNA . 1000ug / ml G418 was added for 1 week to select for stable cell pools . Cell pools were expanded and maintained in 100 µg / ml G418 medium . Alamar blue assay 2500 cells were seeded in 96 well plates and grown in normal tissue culture conditions . Fresh medium was added every other day . 110 µl of a mixture of 10 µl Alamar blue reagent ( Invitrogen , # DAI1025 ) and 100 µl of medium was added in each well at indicated time points and incubated for 2 h . Fluorescence was measured using a Molecular Devices VersaMax 190 Plate Reader . A standard curve was derived by measuring the ﬂ uorescence ( A562 ) from a known number of cells . The experimental cell numbers were interpolated from a standard curve . Fig . 5 Numb isoforms regulate surface expression of integrin β 5 . A Schematic showing the cell surface biotinylation experiment work ﬂ ow . Cell surface proteins were labeled with cell - impermeable EZ - Link Sulfo - NHS - Biotin . Total cell lysate was collected and a fraction of it was used for measuring total amount of individual proteins ( biotinylated and non - biotinylated ) . Biotinylated proteins were captured from total cell lysate by Streptavidin - Sepharose beads and analyzed by immunoblot to compare individual protein expression at the cell surface .

A Colocalization of Numb with ITG β 5 at the basal cell membrane .

B Quanti ﬁ cation of ITG β 5 and Numb at the basal cell surface . TIRF microscopy images were analyzed using Imaris Analysis Software ( see Methods ) to quantify the amount of ITG β 5 and Numb localized to basal membrane patches .

Left : focal adhesions are mature integrin - ECM interactions that engage polymerizing actin network and allows the recruitment and activation SRC . Right : Together with Numb , Integrin β 5 forms long - lived clathrin lattices at the cell surface when engaged with its ECM substrate vitronectin . These structures result in Erk activation and sustained cell proliferation . Adapted from ref . [ 68 ] . F Ex9 - del xenograft tumors exhibit less Erk and Src activation compared to Ctrl tumors . Lysates were prepared from xenograft tumor samples : 7 from the Ctrl group ( 3 from Luc1 and 4 from Luc2 ) and 6 from the Ex9 - del group ( 3 from 911 and 3 from 923 ) . Equal amounts of lysate were immunoblotted for pErk and pSrc ( Y416 ) proteins . Total Erk and total protein respectively were used to normalize the activated proteins for comparison between samples . * p ≤ 0 . 05 by Student ’ s t - test . Error bar , SEM . Y . Zhang et al . 2090 Oncogene ( 2022 ) 41 : 2079 – 2094 Colony formation assay 300 , 600 and 900 cells were seeded in 6 well plates and cultured under normal tissue culture conditions . Fresh medium was replaced every week . After 8 ( MCF7 ) or 21 ( MDA - MB - 468 ) days , the plates were ﬁ xed and stained with crystal violet ( 0 . 1 % w / v ) . Plates were scanned and colonies were quanti ﬁ ed using ImageJ . The crystal violet stain was then solubilized using 1 % SDS , and the signal was measured by absorbance at 590 nm . Xenograft experiments NOD / SCID / gamma ( NSG ) mice were bred in house at The Centre for Phenogenomics ( TCP ) and studies were conducted as approved by the TCP Animal Care Committee . After washing with PBS , 3 × 10 6 MDA - MB - 468 human breast cancer cells were resuspended in 30 µl PBS followed by injection in the fourth mammary fat pads at both sides of randomized 8 – 11 weeks old female NSG mice . After a palpable tumor had formed , the greatest longitudinal diameter ( length ) , transverse diameter ( width ) and height of the tumor was measured with a caliper . Tumor volume was calculated by the modi ﬁ ed ellipsoidal formula : tumor volume = 0 . 5 × ( length× width × height ) . After 12 weeks post injection ( when the largest sum of tumor volumes for one mouse reaches 1700mm 3 ) , tumors were removed , cut into halves at the greatest cross section , and one half was ﬁ xed in 10 % neutralized buffer formalin ( NBF ) for 2 days . The other half was cut into small pieces and snap frozen for future lysate / gDNA extraction . Pieces of xenograft tumor samples were homogenized using a tissue grinder followed by either lysis in Laemmli sample buffer or standard Phenol / Chloroform DNA extraction procedures . The lungs were collected , two lobes were ﬁ xed in 10 % NBF for 2 days followed by paraf ﬁ n embedding . The other lobes were ﬁ xed in Bouin ’ s solution for 2 days , washed in PBS and imaged . Immunohistochemistry Fixed lung and xenograft tumor samples were paraf ﬁ n embedded and sectioned at 5 μ m thickness along the largest surface area . For tumor sections , they were stained with H & E . For lung sections , they were stained with H & E and human E - cadherin antibody , separately . To analyze metastases , paraf ﬁ n embedded lung tissue blocks containing one large lobe and one small lobe for each mouse were sectioned at 9 different levels with a distance of 80 µm between each level to get a random sampling and representation of how metastases distribute throughout the lung . The slides were immune - stained using human speci ﬁ c E - cadherin antibody to only pick up human cell signal from the metastasized tumor cells within mouse lung background . The concentration of the antibody was optimized using the human breast cancer cell xenograft tumor slide as positive control and the normal lung as negative control . Stained slides were scanned with Zeiss Light Sheet Z1 at 20x at the SickKids Imaging Facility . Quanti ﬁ cation of lung metastases To quantify metastases in each group , the border of each metastatic site with at least 5 positively stained cells was manually delineated using Caseviewer software , and the area and number of metastatic sites per section was calculated . The boundary of the lung section was also delineated to determine the “ total area ” of the lung section . The “ unit metastases size ” in each section is calculated by summing the area of individual metastatic sites and dividing that by the number of metastases . The average of the unit metastases size calculated in all sections for each mouse was plotted . Since more metastases are associated with bigger lung area , the “ number of metastases ” in each section is normalized to the total area of the lung section . The average of normalized metastases number in all sections for each mouse was plotted . The “ total metastases area ( % lung ) ” in each section is calculated by the sum of metastases area in that section divided by the area of the lung section . The average of the total metastases area ( % lung ) in all sections for each mouse was plotted . TMT labeling and sample processing Two Ctrl cell pools and three Ex9 - del cell pools from independent targeting events were each seeded to two 150 mm culture plates and grown to 70 % con ﬂ uency . Each plate was washed twice with cold PBS followed by lysis in lysis buffer ( 0 . 5 M Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl , 2 % SDS , 1 % NP - 40 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 40 mM choloroacetamide , 10 mM TCEP , 5 mM EDTA ) . Lysates were sonicated , then boiled for 10 min with shaking . After cooling to room temperature , lysate was centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min . Protein concentrations were measured and 200 µg of protein lysate for each sample was used . 6 volumes of pre - chilled acetone were added to lysate and left overnight at − 20 °C . Protein samples in acetone were centrifuged and acetone was decanted . 100 mM TEAB solution was added to dissolve the protein pellet . 5 µg Trypsin / Lys - C mixture was added to each protein sample to digest at 37 °C overnight . The peptide concentration was measured by the absorbance at 280 nm and 50 µg was labeled with 11 - plex TMT reagents according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions ( Thermo , # 90110 ) . Lyophilized TMT mixes were fractionated using HPLC to obtain 60 fractions followed by LC - MS analysis as described [ 65 ] . TMT labeling mass spectrometry data analysis Control and Ex9 - del MB - MDA - 468 cell protein lysates were prepared , labeled with 11 - plex TMT reagents , and analyzed by LC - MS . For TMT abundance normalization , total sum of the abundance values for each channel over all peptides identi ﬁ ed within a sample was calculated by Proteome Discoverer analysis software . The channel with the highest total abundance was taken as a reference and all abundances in all other channels were normalized by a constant factor per channel , so that at the end the total abundances are the same for all channels . Normalized TMT signal of each protein ( row ) in each sample ( column ) were used . Only proteins with at least 2 peptides observed and identi ﬁ ed in each sample ( a total of 5727 unique proteins ) were analyzed . Fold change ( FC ) of the expression of each protein between Ctrl and Ex9 - del was calculated with the median of 4 Ctrl replicates divided by the median of 6 Ex9 - del replicates . Student ’ s t - test assuming same variance and using one tail alternative was performed between the Ctrl and Ex9 - del replicates and a p - value was obtained for each protein . A volcano plot was generated using log10 ( p - value ) vs log2 ( FC ) . The list of proteins with p - value < 0 . 05 was ranked by log2 ( FC ) and used as the input for gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) . Details in referenced paper [ 33 ] . The Gene sets database used for GSEA PreRanked method is curated by the Bader lab ( Human _ GO _ AllPathways _ with _ GO _ iea _ May _ 01 _ 2020 _ symbol . gmt ) . Default settings were used with 1000 permutations . Heatmap of protein expression in the Ctrl and Ex9 - del replicates were created for proteins involved in the cell surface GO term and two metastasis related pathways using the pheatmap ( version 1 . 0 . 12 ) R package . Surface protein biotinylation assay 70 % con ﬂ uent MB - MDA - 468 or MCF7 cells were cooled on ice , washed with cold PBS , and labeled with ice cold 0 . 2 mg / ml EZ - Link Sulfo - NHS - Biotin ( Thermo , # 21331 ) in biotinylation buffer ( 154 mM NaCl , 10 mM HEPES , 3 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM glucose , pH7 . 6 ) for 1 h at 4 °C . After two washes with cold PBS , cells were incubated with complete medium with 100 mM glycine for 5 min on ice to quench unconjugated biotin and washed three times with cold PBS . The cells were then lysed with PLC lysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 100 mM sodium ﬂ uoride containing COMPLETE protease inhibitor tablets ( Roche Applied Science ) . Protein lysates were quanti ﬁ ed , and 60 microgram of total cell protein lysate was set aside for immunoblot . Equal amounts of protein lysate were mixed with immobilized streptavidin - Sepharose beads ( Pierce , # 20353 ) overnight at 4 °C to isolate biotinylated proteins and then washed one time in PLC lysis buffer and three times in Nonidet P - 40 wash buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM EGTA , 10 % glycerol , 1 . 5 mM CaCl2 , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 ) . The bed volume was removed before resuspending in SDS - Laemmli sample buffer . Recovered biotinylated proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblot using indicated antibodies ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . Semi - qPCR and RT - qPCR Total RNA was isolated and puri ﬁ ed with RNEasy Mini silica columns ( Qiagen # 74106 ) . 1 µg RNA was reverse transcribed using the Applied Biosystems High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( # 4374966 ) and 10 µM oligo - dT primers . PCR reactions were conducted using primers listed in Supplementary Table S2 . The RT qPCR was run on Applied Biosystems QuantiStudio 3 Real - Time PCR Instrument with standard cycle . Each reaction was performed in triplicate with PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems # A25741 ) , using 500 nM of forward and reverse primers ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Reactions were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase expression . Relative 2 − ΔΔ Ct fold change ( FC ) was calculated as previously described [ 23 ] . Y . Zhang et al . 2091 Oncogene ( 2022 ) 41 : 2079 – 2094 Cell spreading assay 150 , 000 resuspended cells were seeded in 24 - well plates precoated with 5ug / ml vitronectin . After the indicated time of attachment , the cells were washed in PBS and ﬁ xed with 2 % PFA . The ﬁ xed cells were permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Tx100 for 5 min , blocked in 3 % Donkey Serum for 1 h at room temperature , and stained with phalloidin - 488 for 1 h at room temperature . The cells were washed in PBS and at least four ﬁ elds were captured on EVOS FL microscope for each sample . At least 10 cell areas were quanti ﬁ ed in each image and in total at least 4 images were quanti ﬁ ed for each condition . Cell lysis and immunoblotting Cells were washed on plates twice with PBS , followed by lysis with 1 X Laemmli Sample buffer ( 63 mM TrisHCl pH6 . 8 , 2 % SDS , 10 % Glycerol ) . Cell lysate was collected into microfuge tubes , boiled for 10 min , and mixed for 10 min . Lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at maximum speed to remove insoluble materials . BCA assay ( Pierce ) was used to determine protein concentration . A mixture of 2 - Mercaptoethanol ( ﬁ nal concentration 5 % ) and bromophenol blue ( ﬁ nal concentration 0 . 001 % ) was added to the lysate and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . After gel electrophoresis , and protein transfer , the PVDF - membrane was blocked with 1 % ﬁ sh gelatin ( Millipore Sigma , # G7765 ) . The membrane was incubated in primary antibody ( Supplementary Table S3 ) overnight followed by three 10 min TBST washes , 1 hr incubation with HRP conjugated secondary antibody , and at least four 15 min TBST washes before development with ECL substrates . BioRad Gel Doc was used to capture the signal after addition of ECL substrate . Membranes were either stripped for reprobing or stained with Coomassie Blue . Coomassie blue stained membranes were used for quanti ﬁ cation of total protein in each lane and to con ﬁ rm equal sample loading . The use of Coomassie staining as a loading control , instead of a single housekeeping protein , is detailed here [ 66 ] . BioRad Image Lab software was used to quantify the band signal . Immuno ﬂ uorescent staining and microscopy Cells grown on uncoated glass coverslips for 18 hr were ﬁ xed with 2 % PFA in PBS for 15 min , washed once with 100 mM glycine / PBS and twice with PBS followed by permeabilization for 10 min with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . Cells were blocked using 3 % Normal Donkey Serum and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer : guinea pig anti - NbC ( 1 / 250 ) and rabbit anti - β 5 integrin ( 1 / 250 ; D23A5 , Cell Signaling Technology , # 3629 ) . Cells were then washed and incubated with ﬂ uorescent - tagged secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature : Cy3 Donkey anti - Guinea Pig ( Jackson Immunore - search Laboratories Inc . # 706 - 165 - 148 ) , Alexa488 Donkey anti - Rabbit ( Invitrogen , # A32790 ) , Cy3 Donkey anti - rabbit ( Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc . # 711 - 165 - 152 , ) , or Alexa488 Donkey anti - guinea pig ( Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc . # 706 - 545 - 148 ) . Imaging was carried out in PBS by TIRF microscopy using a Zeiss ELYRA PS1 with a 100x / 1 . 46 TIRF objective , 488 nm ( 200 mW ) and 561 nm ( 200 mW ) lasers , and an Andor iXon DU867 detector . Quanti ﬁ cation of TIRF images TIRF microscopy images were imported into Imaris 9 . 3 3D / 4D Visualization and Analysis Software ( Bitplane ) for quanti ﬁ cation of ﬂ uorescence intensity , colocalization and area of surface structures / plaques . Single , unattached cells were randomly selected for imaging . Each channel ( anti - Itg β 5 and anti - Numb ) was segmented into a surface based on ﬂ uorescence intensity , using thresholding parameters which resolved plasma mem - brane structures > 150 nm diameter . Identical parameters were used for every image within an experiment , where images were acquired using the same acquisition settings . The ﬂ uorescence intensity and area of each segmented surface were normalized to the area of the cell . Object based colocalization was used to measure the overlap of Itg β 5 and Numb surfaces using the Surface to Surface Colocalization extension . The colocalized area was normalized to the total area occupied by each surface . Four independent experiments were analyzed ( n = 29 , 27 , 33 , 15 Luc1 control cells and n = 25 , 25 , 32 , 15 Ex9 - del cells ) . Survival analysis PFIs ( time to a new tumor or death incidence ) for each of the TCGA samples were downloaded from TCGA - CDR [ 30 ] and used for survival analysis . The same TCGA barcode structure is used for both NUMB exon usage and total expression data and the clinical metadata which allowed for integrated analysis of patient outcome with molecular data . Breast cancer molecular subgroups information was acquired from the TCGAbiolink ( version 2 . 12 . 6 ) R package . Within each breast cancer subtype , primary tumors are strati ﬁ ed into exon 9 high ( top 10th percentile ) and low ( bottom 10th percentile ) subgroups based on NUMB exon 9 PSI values . Exon 3 PSI value was used to stratify patients into exon 3 high ( top 10th percentile ) and low ( bottom 10th percentile ) subgroups . NUMB total transcript level ( normalized readcounts ) was also used to stratify patients into Numb high ( top 10th percentile ) and Numb low ( bottom 10th percentile ) subgroups . A Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the PFI between the exon 9 high / low subgroups using breast cancer subtypes as a covariate . A univariate Kaplan – Meier test was also done on PFI in exon 9 high / low , exon 3 high / low and Numb high / low subgroups . Statistical analysis Two tailed unpaired Student ’ s t test ( parametric ) and Wilcoxon test ( nonparametric ) were used to determine statistical signi ﬁ cance of differences between control and experimental groups unless otherwise speci ﬁ ed . Survival analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan – Meier survival ( log - rank ) method . P - value is considered signi ﬁ cant when ≤ 0 . 05 . * p ≤ 0 . 05 . * * p ≤ 0 . 01 . * * * p ≤ 0 . 001 . * * * * p ≤ 0 . 0001 . Values are reported as mean ± SEM . All analyses were performed using Graph Pad Prism except for the analysis of RNAseq data which are compared and graphed in R ( version 3 . 6 . 3 ) .
