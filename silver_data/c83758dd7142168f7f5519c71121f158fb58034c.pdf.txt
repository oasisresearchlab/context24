Louis , MO 63110 ortical actin patches are the most prominent actin structure in budding and ﬁssion yeast . Patches assem - ble , move , and disassemble rapidly . We investigated the mechanisms underlying patch actin assembly and motility by studying actin ﬁlament ultrastructure within a patch . Actin patches were partially puriﬁed from Saccharomy - ces cerevisiae and examined by negative - stain electron mi - croscopy ( EM ) . To identify patches in the EM , we corre - lated ﬂuorescence and EM images of GFP - labeled patches . Patches contained a network of actin ﬁlaments with branches C characteristic of Arp2 / 3 complex . An average patch con - tained 85 ﬁlaments . The average ﬁlament was only 50 - nm ( 20 actin subunits ) long , and the ﬁlament to branch ratio was 3 : 1 . Patches lacking Sac6 / ﬁmbrin were unstable , and patches lacking capping protein were relatively normal . Our results are consistent with Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization driving yeast actin patch assembly and motility , as described by a variation of the dendritic nucleation model . Introduction Budding yeast contain actin binding and regulatory proteins , most of which are found in all eukaryotes , suggesting that fundamental mechanisms of actin dynamics and regulation may be conserved ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . However , the actin concentration is much less in yeast than in vertebrate cells ( Nefsky and Bretscher , 1992 ) . The most prominent yeast actin structures are cortical patches ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ) , which have been implicated in endocytosis and cell wall remodeling ( Utsugi et al . , 2002 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Actin patches are dynamic . They assemble , move , and disas - semble within minutes . Patch formation and movement appear to require actin polymerization nucleated by Arp2 / 3 complex ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) . Purified Arp2 / 3 complex generates end to side branches with a specific angle and polarity ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Volkmann et al . , 2001 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex branches have been observed in cell extracts and detergent - extracted cultured vertebrate cells ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ; Cameron et al . , 2001 ) . In situ cryoEM studies of Dictyostelium revealed branched thin filaments , but filament polarity was not deter - mined and many branch angles were not characteristic of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Medalia et al . , 2002 ) . Actin - based motility can be reconstituted with purified Arp2 / 3 complex , capping protein , and ADF / cofilin ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . This observation and the biochemical and structural studies above have led to the dendritic nucleation model ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) , which is proposed to account for actin - based motility in vertebrate cells at the leading edge and comet tails of pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . The dendritic nucleation model may apply to yeast actin patches . Activators of Arp2 / 3 complex appear to direct the growth and maturation of actin patches ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . However , although capping protein colocalizes with Arp2 / 3 complex at sites of actin assembly in most systems ( Wear and Cooper , 2004 ) , and capping protein is a yeast actin patch component , yeast strains lacking capping protein are viable , and their actin patches assemble and move ( Kim et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , cofilin may be unnecessary for patch motility ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . Thus , the dendritic nucleation model may not apply to actin patches . Actin patch assembly and movement in yeast have been well studied by genetic , cell biological , and biochemical approaches . However , a key piece of the puzzle is missing : how are actin filaments in a patch organized ? Ultrastructural studies of the yeast actin cytoskeleton have been challenging because of the high density of yeast cytosol .

Rapid - freeze , deep - etch EM of the plasma membrane’s cytoplasmic face revealed structures containing short actin filaments and several actin - binding patch com - ponents ( A . Rodal , B . Goode , D . Drubin , and J . Hartwig , personal communications ) . In this work , we isolated and partially purified GFP - labeled actin patches and correlated fluorescence and EM images to identify actin patches in the EM . Patches contained networks of branched actin filaments . The network charac - teristics in wild - type and mutant cells have implications for patch assembly and movement and the applicability of the dendritic nucleation model in yeast . Results and discussion Purification of actin patches Actin patches are at the cell cortex , but when yeast are lysed , patches are expelled with the cytoplasm ( Fig . 1 A ) . To purify actin patches , we GFP - labeled them and followed them by fluorescence microscopy . Unless stated otherwise , we GFP - labeled the Cap1 subunit of capping protein . GFP - labeled patches in cell lysates did not correlate with any structures observed with DIC or phase contrast optics and were absent in preparations from strains lacking GFP . Actin patches were stable at 4 (cid:2) C in a concentrated cell lysate for (cid:3) 24 h , but disassembled in (cid:4) 2 h at 25 (cid:2) C or when diluted into a va - riety of buffers . We found that KS buffer , which contains 1 M sorbitol and 0 . 2 M potassium phosphate , stabilized patches to dilution for hours . Because patches in vivo turn over in minutes , we asked if KS stabilized actin filaments . Pure actin filaments disassembled in (cid:4) 100 s when diluted into control buffers , but only (cid:2) 5 % of actin depolymerized within 10 min when diluted into KS . Phosphate alone prevented depolymerization ( Fig . S1 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200404159 / DC1 ) , and it stabilizes Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin branches ( Blan - choin et al . , 2000 ) . However , stabilizing actin patches re - quired both phosphate and sorbitol . If purified patches are to be representative of patches in cells , then the patches and the actin filaments within them must be stable . Most important , there should be no poly - merization creating new structures , especially in the cell ly - sate , where there is a pool of monomeric actin . We quanti - tated F - actin and capping protein in patches in vivo and in the lysate . Rhodamine - phalloidin staining of patches , re - flecting F - actin content , decreased (cid:2) 5 % after lysis , whereas Cap1 - GFP decreased by (cid:2) 35 % . Patches with increased brightness were not observed ( Fig . 1 , B – D ) . Patches labeled with Abp1 - GFP or Sac6 / fimbrin - GFP gave similar results . Thus , with respect to actin filaments and three actin - bind - ing proteins , patches remained intact through cell lysis , and net actin assembly did not occur in the lysate . We purified patches by differential centrifugation . A ly - sate of spheroplasts was cleared with a low speed spin , yield - ing fraction S1 . At this point , the chemical cross - linker glu - taraldehyde was usually added to preserve patch structure . Cross - linking was not essential and was omitted for certain experiments as described . A high speed clarification and three velocity centrifugations , the latter two on sucrose gra - dients , yielded fractions S2 , I3 , P4 , and P5 . The yield of patches was not affected by addition of 5 (cid:5) M phalloidin , 2 mM MgCl 2 , or 1 mM EGTA . Patches were stable even when purified without chemical cross - linker treatment . To determine if patch stability re - sulted from a balance of actin polymerization and depoly - merization , we added 20 (cid:5) M latrunculin A to fraction P4 , at a 10 8 M excess to actin subunits . The number and inten - sity of GFP - labeled patches did not change over 16 h at 4 (cid:2) C . Also , we induced patches to disassemble over (cid:2) 2 h by rais - ing the temperature to 25 (cid:2) C and measured the number and fluorescence intensity of GFP - labeled patches with or with - out 4 (cid:5) M latrunculin . Latrunculin did not affect the rate of patch disassembly , indicating that in the conditions of our protocol , even in the absence of cross - linker , actin patches Figure 1 .

Patches did disassemble if removed from high osmolarity or cold temperature . To assess the purification , we performed SDS - PAGE on fractions of a purification performed without chemical cross - linker . Coomassie - stained protein profiles of lysed cells , cleared lysate , and all fractions up to I3 were indistin - guishable . Actin was the most prominent band in P5 , a sub - stantial enrichment . However , most of the P5 bands were also present in I3 , showing that the purification was only partial ( Fig . 1 E ) . We also counted the number of GFP - labeled patches and examined the relative amount of actin with Western blots . Actin cofractionated with GFP - labeled patches except for the presence of some actin , presumably free monomers , in the supernatant above fraction I3 . The number of Cap1 - GFP labeled patches and the amount of ac - tin were enriched (cid:2) 50 - fold and (cid:3) 300 - fold , respectively , relative to fraction S1 ( Table I ) . Abp1 - GFP was lost from patches to a greater degree than was Cap1 - GFP . The enrich - ment of GFP - labeled patches was significantly higher in cross - linked preparations , although SDS - PAGE and immu - noblot analysis of these samples were not possible . Identification of actin patches in the EM Even with chemical cross - linker , actin patches were only partially purified , so we needed to identify patches in the EM . We adhered GFP - labeled patches to an EM grid and examined the grid by fluorescence microscopy . The same grid was negative - stained and examined in the EM . Fiducial marks , including grid bars , were used to align brightfield and fluorescence images with low magnification EM images , allowing one to identify GFP - labeled patches unambigu - ously . Every GFP - labeled patch coincided with a structure in the EM , but only (cid:2) 10 % of negatively stained objects contained GFP ( Fig . 2 ) . Actin patches from chemically cross - linked preparations contained branched networks of thin filaments resembling Table I .

The correlation between filament networks and fluo - rescent patches was very good . In areas where the negative stain allowed filament visualization , (cid:3) 95 % of fluorescent patches coincided with filament networks , and (cid:3) 90 % of thin filament networks coincided with a fluorescent patch . In addition , the fluorescence intensity correlated with fila - ment network size . Often , proteinaceous material obscured the filaments in a portion of a patch ( Fig . 2 ) . Filaments were less apparent in actin patch preparations purified without chemical cross - linking , even considering the lower yield of patches . These putative patches were pre - dominantly membranous and proteinaceous with a few thin filaments at their periphery . Neither 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 nor 1 M NaCl treatment increased the appearance of filaments substantially . However , addition of 50 (cid:5) M latrunculin A for 5 min at 25 (cid:2) C , followed by fixation , did produce filamen - tous networks ( Fig . 3 ) . This result is quite surprising , and we do not have a compelling explanation for why latruncu - lin should have this effect . However , new polymerization should not occur in the presence of latrunculin . Thus , the branched filaments must have been present before the treat - ment . We do not know if latrunculin affected the network’s organization . Most filament networks in latrunculin - treated prepara - tions were associated with 1 – 3 (cid:5) m membranous structures ( Fig . 3 ) . In the absence of cross - linker , addition of 0 . 1 – 10 % Triton X - 100 to cell lysate did not affect GFP - labeled patches ; however , patches disappeared when the lysate was centrifuged . Thus , membrane may stabilize some patches to centrifugations . These are a minority of patches because Figure 3 . Actin patches from preparations lacking cross - linker , with S1 decoration . Actin patches prepared without cross - linking were treated briefly with latrunculin A , exposing filamentous networks . Most patches were associated with membranes ( A ) ; others were not ( B ) .

S1 decoration and the branching pattern of actin patch filaments We decorated filaments with myosin S1 . The patches could not be chemically cross - linked for S1 binding , so latrunculin treatment was used , as described above . The filaments were decorated in a chevron pattern characteristic of actin . At ev - ery end to side branch , the daughter filament’s barbed end projected away from the branch point ( Fig . 3 C ) . The angle between the daughter filament and the mother filament seg - ment with the barbed end was 69 (cid:7) 8 (cid:2) ( mean (cid:7) SD , n (cid:6) 18 ) , the same as 70 (cid:7) 7 (cid:2) for branches seen with purified Arp2 / 3 complex ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Volkmann et al . , 2001 ) . Lamellipodia of vertebrate cells contain Arp2 / 3 com - plex branches with barbed ends oriented toward the leading edge ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . The branched filaments in our yeast actin patches showed no linear or radial directional - ity ; the network was isotropic . Negative staining flattens the specimen , so some architectural features may have been lost . In 11 patches from a cross - linked preparation , patch di - ameter was 409 (cid:7) 170 nm ( mean (cid:7) SD ; range , 150 – 750 ) , the number of filaments per patch was 85 (cid:7) 46 ( mean (cid:7) SD ; range , 18 – 174 ) , the number of end to side branches per patch was 29 (cid:7) 16 ( mean (cid:7) SD ; range , 7 – 57 ) , and the av - erage filament length was 50 (cid:7) 27 nm ( mean (cid:7) SD ; n (cid:6) 938 ; range , 10 – 195 ) . A representative analysis of one patch is shown in Fig . 4 . The short filament length and degree of branching supports the notion that Arp2 / 3 - based nucleation activity in patches is present as indicated by studies of Arp2 / 3 mutants ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) . We looked for evidence of different populations of patches . In lamellipodia , filaments become longer and less branched over time ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) so older patches might have longer or less branched filaments . However , the average filament length was uniform ( Fig . S2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200404159 / DC1 ) , and filament architecture was similar in all patches . Patch di - ameter , number of filaments , and number of branches corre - lated significantly ( Fig . S2 ) . Thus , patches differed only in size , containing different amounts of branched filament network . The daughter was more often attached near the middle of the mother filament ; 51 % of branches were in the middle third of the mother filament , whereas 24 – 25 % occurred in each distal third ( n (cid:6) 91 , P (cid:4) 0 . 1 by (cid:10) 2 ) . The daughter fila - ment length was 66 (cid:7) 38 % of the entire length of its mother filament . Analysis of mutant patches Yeast Sac6 / fimbrin bundles actin filaments in vitro , localizes to patches in vivo , and is present at a 1 : 10 molar ratio with actin ( Goodman et al . , 2003 ) . However , bundles were not seen in patches from wild - type cells . Purified yeast Sac6 / fim - brin also stabilizes actin filaments against depolymerization ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) , and s ac6 (cid:11) mutant strains have synthetic defects with many actin - regulating proteins ( Goodman et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , we asked if Sac6 was important for patch Figure 4 . Actin patches from cross - linked preparations . ( A ) The branched filament network of a typical actin patch . Arrowheads mark some branches . ( B ) A graphical representation ( bottom ) of the actin filaments in another typical patch ( top ) . Filament length and branching were quantitated for this patch , as indicated by the green lines and red dots , respectively . Strain YJC1453 . on D e c e m be r 22 , 2011 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 30 , 2004 634 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 166 , Number 5 , 2004 stability and integrity by purifying and studying patches from a strain lacking Sac6 / fimbrin . Actin patches from a sac6 null strain disassembled within 20 min of cell lysis in the absence of chemical cross - linker , even in the presence of 1 M sorbitol . Wild - type patches were stable for (cid:3) 24 h under these condi - tions . Even sac6 (cid:11) patches cross - linked within 5 min of cell ly - sis were significantly dimmer than patches in vivo . We identi - fied purified sac6 (cid:11) patches , or patch fragments , in the EM by correlation microscopy . They were smaller in diameter ( 70 – 290 nm , n (cid:6) 10 ) than wild - type patches ( 150 – 750 nm ) with proportionately fewer filaments and branches . However , the density and architecture of the network was normal ( Fig . 5 ) . Therefore , Sac6 / fimbrin is important for patch stability , pos - sibly stabilizing filaments by side - binding , but is not essential for the general architecture . Capping protein has a central role in the dendritic nucle - ation model , localizes to actin patches in yeast ( Kim et al . , 2004 ) , and increases branching by Arp2 / 3 complex in actin polymerization reactions in vitro ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000 ) . Unexpectedly , actin patches purified from a cap1 null strain , with Sac6 - GFP , showed a qualitatively normal organization of actin filaments , including filament length and branching , relative to wild - type patches . The dendritic nucleation model and yeast actin patches The dendritic nucleation model applies only in part to the assembly and motility of yeast actin patches . The model pre - dicts a highly branched filament network with branches characteristic of Arp2 / 3 complex , which we observed here . The model is also supported by previous studies showing Arp2 / 3’s importance for patch assembly and motility ( Win - ter et al . , 1997 ) . On the other hand , the model predicts an important role for capping protein , and the filament archi - tecture of patches lacking capping protein was normal here . Moreover , capping protein and cofilin are not necessary for normal patch movement in vivo ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Kim et al . , 2004 ) . Perhaps yeast cytoplasm in general lacks free barbed ends that must be capped to “funnel” actin polymerization to the patch . Indeed , free barbed ends are detected only at actin patches in permeabilized cell assays ( Li et al . , 1995 ; Kim et al . , 2004 ) . Materials and methods Yeast strains Cap1 - GFP was expressed in the MAT a Research Genetics / Invitrogen S288C background ( BY4742 , his3 (cid:11) ura 3 (cid:11) leu2 (cid:11) met15 (cid:11) ) , by integrating GFP at the 3 (cid:12) end of the CAP1 locus , as described previously ( Karpova et al . , 1998 ) , resulting in strain YJC2718 . The Cap1 - GFP fusion rescues the actin patch depolarization phenotype of a cap1 (cid:11) strain . YJC2718 was crossed with the Research Genetics / Invitrogen MAT (cid:13) sac6 (cid:11) strain ( record number 14063 ) , sporulated , and tetrad dissected , resulting in the strain YJC3580 ( MAT a CAP1 - GFP - HIS3 sac6 (cid:11) : : KanR his3 (cid:11) ura 3 (cid:11) leu2 (cid:11) ) . The presence of Cap1 - GFP was verified visually by fluorescence microscopy as well as by PCR across the junction of CAP1 and GFP . The sac6 (cid:11) disruption was confirmed by sequencing the upstream tag . A haploid cap1 (cid:11) Sac6 - GFP strain , YJC3481 ( MAT a SAC6 - GFP - HIS3 cap1 (cid:11) : : KanR his3 (cid:11) ura 3 (cid:11) leu2 (cid:11) lys2 (cid:11) ) , and a homozygous diploid CAP1 - GFP strain , YJC1453 ( MAT a / (cid:13) CAP1 - GFP - HIS3 / CAP1 - GFP - HIS3 his3 / his3 ura3 / ura3 leu2 / leu2 ) , were described previously ( Karpova et al . , 2000 ; Kim et al . , 2004 ) . Actin patch purification Yeast were grown in 1 liter of YPD to an OD 600 of (cid:2) 1 . 0 . Cells were washed twice with KS ( 200 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 , 1 M sorbi - tol ) , suspended in 1 ml KS , 0 . 1 M (cid:14) - mercaptoethanol , and 0 . 6 mg / ml zy - molyase 20T ( ICN Biomedicals ) , and incubated for 1 h at 37 (cid:2) C . Sphero - plasts were washed twice with KS , suspended in 1 ml of 2 % Mega - 9 nonionic detergent ( Calbiochem ) in low sorbitol ( 0 . 5 M ) KS , with 2 mM PMSF , 2 mM benzamidine , 20 (cid:5) g / ml leupeptin , and 20 (cid:5) g / ml pepstatin A . 10 – 12 triturations with a 0 . 46 - mm bore 200 (cid:5) l pipet ( Rainin ) were per - formed . Further steps were performed at 4 (cid:2) C . The lysate was cleared by a 10 - min microfuge centrifugation , yielding fraction S1 . In some experi - ments , 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde was added to S1 for 10 min and quenched with 0 . 2 M ammonium acetate . S1 was centrifuged 10 min at 70 , 000 rpm in a TLA100 . 1 rotor in an ultracentrifuge ( model Optima TL ; Beckman Coulter ) . The supernatant S2 was collected , avoiding lipid at the meniscus , layered on 100 (cid:5) l KS pads , and centrifuged in the same way for 30 min . The bottom (cid:2) 150 (cid:5) L from each tube , fraction I3 , was mixed 1 : 1 with KS , loaded onto a 10 ml 5 – 20 % sucrose gradient in KS , and centrifuged 2 . 5 h at 30 , 000 rpm in a SW - 41 rotor . The bottom 100 – 200 (cid:5) l , fraction P4 , was mixed 1 : 1 with 0 . 2 M potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 , and centrifuged on a sucrose gradient as before . The bottom 100 – 200 (cid:5) l , fraction P5 , was di - luted 1 : 1 with 0 . 2 M potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 , stored on ice , and used within 24 h . P5 was microfuged for 3 min before use . Negative stain EM Glow - discharged formvar - coated copper grids were placed onto 30 (cid:5) l of sample for 5 – 10 min . In some experiments the grids were moved to 50 (cid:5) M latrunculin A , 2 . 5 % DMSO in KS for 5 min . Grids were moved rapidly through two drops of KS , into 1 % glutaraldehyde in KS . After 5 – 10 min grids were moved through four drops each of KS , 40 (cid:5) g / ml bacitracin , and 0 . 02 (cid:5) m filtered 3 % phosphotungstic acid . Excess liquid was blotted , and dried grids were viewed on a JEOL - 1200EX electron microscope at 80 – 90 kV ( Lewis and Bridgman , 1992 ) . Fluorescence microscopy and correlation of images GFP - labeled actin patches were viewed in whole yeast and cell extracts using a HiQ FITC filter cube and a cooled CCD camera as described previ - ously ( Karpova et al . , 2000 ) . Cell lysates and spheroplasts were stained with 660 nM rhodamine - phalloidin ( Fluka ) after fixation with 0 . 1 % glutar - aldehyde , and the spheroplasts were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . Fluorescence intensity was quantitated with NIH Image . For correlation microscopy , EM grids with GFP - labeled patches were immersed in KS and placed between a slide and coverslip . Excess liquid was wicked away . Bright field and fluorescence images were taken . To avoid damaging the formvar grid , we only brought the objective close enough to focus , and we did not move the specimen while in focus . Cumu - lative fluorescence exposure was limited to 5 s to avoid background fluo - rescence from formvar . Coverslips and grids were floated off slides with KS , and the grids were gently blotted and processed for negative stain EM . Figure 5 . Cross - linked actin patches lacking Sac6 / fimbrin .

Patches from haploid and diploid strains were similar . Online supplemental material Online supplemental material includes protein methods and two figures . Fig . S1 shows actin depolymerization after dilution into KS or other buffers . Fig . S2 shows which actin patch characteristics are correlated .
