Itiswell established that an upregulation of glial - derived chondroitin sul - phate proteoglycans ( CSPGs ) within the glial scar and perineuronal net creates a barrier to axonal regrowth and sprouting 1 – 5 .

Here we find in rats that PTP s has a critical role in converting growth cones into a dystrophic state by tightly stabilizing them within CSPG - rich substrates . We gener - ated a membrane - permeable peptide mimetic of the PTP s wedge domainthatbindstoPTP s andrelievesCSPG - mediatedinhibition . Systemic delivery of this peptide over weeks restored substantial serotonergic innervation to the spinal cord below the level of injury and facilitated functional recovery of both locomotor and urinary systems .

This morphology is remarkably similar to that describedin the early 20th century by Ramon y Cajal in the chronically injured cat spinal cord 11 .

Wefoundsimilareleva - tions of LAR , but not NgRs ( Extended Data Fig . 1a , b ) . In addition , we observed a large concentration of PTP s in the lesion penumbra after SCI ( Extended Data Fig . 1c , d ) . As PTP s co - localizes with adhesion plaques and focal adhesions 12 , 13 , we hypothesized that it had a critical role in growth cone immobilization and progression into a dystrophic state . Therefore , we sought to target PTP s to relieve CSPG - mediated inhibition . Upon analysing the structure of PTP s and relatedphosphatases , we identifiedahighlyconserved24 - amino - acidintracellularwedgedomain ( Fig . 2aandExtended Data Fig . 2a , b ) .

Importantly , treatment of adult PTP s - null sensory neurons with ISPdidnotfurtherincreasecrossings ( Fig . 2j ) 6 . Inaddition , matureastro - cytes , which have immunocytochemically undetectable PTP s 18 , were unable to traverse the CSPG gradient after ISP treatment ( Extended DataFig . 3a ) . However , PTP s - expressingsatellitegliawereinducedto cross successfully ( Extended Data Fig . 3b ) . These results suggest spe - cificity of ISP interactions through PTP s . ISPconcentrationsabovetheoptimaldoseforgradientcrossinggreatly reduced neuronal cell attachment , suggesting a reversal of the over - adhered phenotype . ISP treatment decreased interactions between the CSPG - rich substrate and PTP s , allowing cells to detach in response to agitation ( Fig . 2l and Extended Data Fig . 3c , d ) . This suggests that appropriatelevelsofadhesionarecriticalforregenerationacrossincreas - ing concentrations of innately inhibitory CSPGs 19 .

TAT - conjugatedpeptidesareknowntocrossbiologicalmembranes , including the blood – brain barrier 22 . One hour after a single subcutan - eous injection of fluoresceinisothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated ISP , we were able to visualize ISP in the intact nervous system ( Extended Data Fig . 5a , b ) . Therefore , wechose a non - invasive systemic treatment para - digm using dailysubcutaneous injections , avoiding complications asso - ciatedwithintraparenchymaldelivery 23 . Beginning1dayaftercontusive SCI , rats were treated with ISP ( 11 m g per day ) , ILP ( 11 m g per day ) or vehicle once daily for 7 consecutive weeks ( Extended Data Fig . 5c – e ) .

No vehicle - or ILP - treated animals displayed multiple coordinated bursts of the EUS dur - ing a void ( Fig . 3e , h ) . Althoughthedetrusor was stillhyperactive , 10 of the 15 analysed ISP - treated animals recovered coordination between bladder contractions and EUS phasic bursting , suggesting reconnec - tion of a functional circuit ( Fig . 3f , g ) 26 . We measured locomotor recovery using theBasso , Beattieand Bres - nahan ( BBB ) scale and a gridwalk test 27 . After SCI , vehicle - and ILP - treatedanimalsrecoveredfromhindlimbparalysisatday1to , onaverage , occasional weight bearing stepping at week 11 ( Fig . 3i ) . ISP treatment resultedinasignificantprogressiverecoveryoflocomotion , whichbegan several weeks after injury ( Fig . 3i ) . Thirty per cent of ISP - treated ani - mals ( versus zero vehicle / ILP - treated animals ) demonstrated , at least , frequent coordinated stepping ( BBB $ 13 ) , with three rats achieving BBB scores $ 17 . 5 ( Fig . 3j – k ) . Furthermore , ISP - treated animals made on average 58 % fewer foot faults than control rats on the gridwalk test ( Fig . 3l , m ) , suggesting recovery of sensorimotor coordination and bal - ance . Importantly , aside from minor irritation at the injection site after multiple weeks of treatment , ISP did not induce neuropathic pain ( Ex - tended Data Fig . 7a , b ) . Interestingly , no correlation between ISP - induced recovered behav - iourswasobserved ( ExtendedDataFig . 7c – e ) . Usingstringentthreshold analyses , wedetermined that21 of 26 ISP - treatedanimalsrecovered at least one behaviour , with 3 animals recovering all three ( Fig . 3n ) . Fur - ther analyses demonstrated the degree to which responding animals benefited from treatment ( Extended Data Fig . 7f – h ) . Taken together , this suggests that the re - acquisition of each behaviour is modular and not coincident , and may reflect anatomical differences in the pattern of axon re - innervation . The behavioural results representthe average offiverepetitions , each performed with newly synthesizedpeptide , blindedbehavioural testers and a separate blinded treatment administrator . Although variability existed , ISP increased functional recovery of each behaviour in all cohorts ( Extended Data Fig . 8 ) . In a final group of animals , urinary , butnot locomotorbehaviours , responded toincreasing concentrations of ISP , with our maximum ( 44 m g per day ) dose improving urination markedly in all rats ( Extended Data Fig . 7g ) . Therefore , further optim - izationofthedoseoradministrativerouteofISPmayleadtoadditionalfunctionalimprovements . ISP treatment was not neuroprotective , as it did not lead to differ - ences inlesionsize orsparedwhitematter ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Attheindividual animal level , the variability in spared tissue correlated with functional recovery in vehicle - , but not ISP - treated rats ( Extended Data Fig . 9 ) . Although regenerative pathways are difficult to examine after con - tusive SCI 28 , we did not observe any lengthy regenerating biotinylated dextranamine ( BDA ) - labelledcorticospinaltractfibres ( datanotshown ) . We focused further analysis on the serotonergic system ( 5HT ) neu - rons , which express LAR family receptors and contribute to proper neuromodulatorytoneinlocomotionandmicturitioncircuitry 7 , 26 , 29 , 30 . Contusive SCI led to a marked decrease in descending 5HT - positive fibrescaudaltothelesion ( Fig . 4c , e , h ) . Inanimalsexhibitingfunctional recovery after ISP treatment , we observed unusually shaped , densely sproutedterritoriesof5HTfibresbelowthelevelofthelesion ( Fig . 4d , f , i – n ) . These patterns corresponded in part with neurofilament staining ( Extended Data Fig . 10 ) , but were not present in sections stained for GFAP , ED1 or 4 9 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) , ensuring that the sharp edges of staining were not due to tissue folds . We speculate that physical constraints of the perineuronal net may confine fibres in these patterns . Their spatialvariability , in conjunction with differences in tract sparing from animal to animal after contusion , could partially account for the disparity in behavioural recovery between animals . Treatmentwiththe5HTreceptorantagonistmethysergideat14weeks after SCI significantly reduced locomotor and urinary function in ISP - treated , but not vehicle - treated animals ( Fig . 4o , p ) 26 , 29 .

However , behavioural improvements were not fully reverted to vehiclelevels and gridwalk scores were onlyminimally affec - ted ( Fig . 4q ) , suggesting plasticity of other pathways outside the seroto - nergic system . While CSPGs have largely been thought to act as repulsive compo - nents of the extracellular matrix , our results suggest that regenerating adult growth cones can become permanently immobilized by CSPG gradients . These observations highlight an initial cellular mechanism regulated by PTP s that leads to the development of axonal dystrophy and the prevention of chronic regeneration and plasticity in vivo . Sys - temic modulation of PTP s opens a new therapeutic avenue in non - invasive treatments for enhancing functionalrecovery after a variety of injuries ordiseasesinwhichproteoglycans inhibittheattempt ofaxons to regenerate or sprout .

Both the growth cone andaxonwere manuallytracedand themean pixel intensity was calculated . All images were taken using identical settings . CSPG gradientcrossing assay . CSPGgradientswere prepared asdescribedprev - iously 9 . Glass coverslips ( 1 . 6mm , Fisher Scientific ) coated with poly - L - lysine and nitrocellulose were spotted with a 2 m l solution of aggrecan ( 0 . 7mgml 2 1 ) and lami - nin ( 5 m gml 2 1 ) inHBSS - CMF ( 4spotspercoverslip ) . Afterthespotswereallowedto dry , the coverslips were incubated with laminin ( 5 m gml 2 1 ) in HBSS - CMF at 37 u C for 3h . Dissociated DRG neurons were plated at a density of 1 , 000cellscm 2 2 in Neurobasal - A supplemented with B27 , Glutamax and penicillin / streptomycin and incubated for 5 days at 37 u C . For peptide experiments , appropriate concentrations of peptide were added to themediaatthetime of plating . For ChABC experiments , 0 . 1Uml 2 1 ChABC ( Seikagaku ) was added to coverslips for 2h after the laminin bath before cell plating . At 5 days , cultures were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30min . After severalrinsesinPBS , thecoverslipswereincubatedinblockingsolution ( 5 % normal goat serum or normal donkey serum , 0 . 1 % BSA , and with or without0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS ) for 1h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 u C inprimary antibody .

FivevehicleanimalsandtwoILPanimalswereremovedfromthe study and euthanized due to bladder infections and other serious ailments . One ISP - treated animal was removed due to a bladder stone . Dorsal column crush injury . Dorsal column crush was performed similarly to as described previously 31 . Rats were anaesthetized with inhaled isoflurane gas ( 2 % ) forallsurgical procedures . A T1laminectomywasperformedtoexposethedorsal aspect of the C8 spinal cord segment . Durotomies were made bilaterally 0 . 75mm frommidlinewitha30 - gaugeneedle . Adorsalcolumncrushlesionwasthenmade by inserting Dumont no . 3 jeweller’s forceps into the dorsal spinal cord at C8 to a depthof1 . 0mmandsqueezingtheforceps , holdingpressurefor10sandrepeating two additional times . The muscle layers were sutured with 4 - 0 nylon suture , and the skin was closed with surgical staples . Animals were perfused at 14 days after injury . Systemic peptide treatment . All randomization and peptide treatments were prepared by a blinded laboratory member not associated with behavioural ana - lyses . First , a vehicle solution of 1 . 25ml DMSO in 23 . 75ml sterile saline was pre - pared for each animal . Next , appropriate peptide was added to each of the vehicle solutionswhere applicable so that the final peptide concentration of each solution was5 m M . Eachdrugsolutionwasthenaliquottedinto50individual1 . 5mlEppendorf tubes , eachcorrespondingtoasingleanimal’sdailydose , andfrozenat 2 20 u C . All peptideswererandomizedandblindedtoboththeanimaltreatmentadministratorandseparatebehaviouralanalyser . At 24h after SCI and each morning thereafter for 49consecutive days , animals were given a 500 m l subcutaneousinjection of the appropriate blinded treatment into the back above the lesion ( n 5 21 vehicle , n 5 26ISP , n 5 10ILP ) Thisexperimentwascarriedoutwithfivedifferentcohorts ofanimals , withfreshlysynthesizedpeptidevalidated invitro usingtheCSPGgra - dient assay and prepared for each cohort of animals . ILP treatments were only performed in the first and last cohort because we did not observe behavioural improvement with ILP treatment . For the dose response , additional injured animals ( N 5 5 per group , cohort 4 ) were injected with 1 / 3 3 ISP ( 3 . 6 m g per day ) , 1 / 2 3 ISP ( 5 . 5 m g per day ) , 2 3 ISP ( 22 m g per day ) , 3 3 ISP ( 33 m g per day ) or 4 3 ISP ( 44 m g per day ) . FITC - ISP peptide tracking . FITC - ISP was synthesized by Genscript with FITC conjugatedtotheN - terminusTATdomain . Asingle500 m linjectionofeither10 m M FITC - ISP in 5 % DMSO plus saline or vehicle was given to animals subcutaneously intotheback .

Twenty - micrometre - thickcoronalsectionsofunfixedspinalcordtissuewere collectedonacryostatandimmediatelyimagedonaLeitzOrthoplan2fluorescencemicroscope . Methysergide . A subset of ISP - and vehicle - treated animals were injected with methysergide ( 5mgkg 2 1 , Sigma - Aldrich ) intraperitoneally once a day for 3 days at 14 weeks after SCI ( n 5 8 vehicle , n 5 12 ISP ) . Gridwalk and metabolic cage analyses were performed on days 0 and day 3 , while BBB scoring was conducted daily . Inadditiontothefullpopulation , theanimalswhosebehaviourstartedabove or below a threshold level of two standard deviations above vehicle mean ( see Fig . 4f ) were plotted separately as responding and non - responding . Behavioural analysis OpenfieldBBB . Allbehaviouranalyseswereconductedbytwoblindedobservers separate from the researcher performing the daily dosing . Each animal was tested on days 1 , 4 , 7 andweeklythereafter until week 11 . Animals were allowedtofreely roam on an open field while being observed by two Ohio State Spinal Cord Injury Course expertly trained observers and scored according to the BBB guidelines 27 . AnyanimalwithaBBBscoreofgreaterthan1atday1wasremovedfromthestudy . Datawere quantified asthe average ofthe twohindlimbs , compiled , andgraphed . Gridwalk . The gridwalk test was performed at 12 weeks after SCI . Animals were allowed to freely roam on a 75cm 3 40cm raised grid ( 2 . 5mm thick wires , 2cm gaps between wires ) for 5min while their progress was tracked with an overhead cameraandquantifiedastotaldistancetravelled ( Ethovision ) . Footfaultswerecounted manually by a blinded observer and quantified as total number of hindlimb faults per metre . Thermal hyperalgesia . Hyperalgesia analysis was performed at 12 weeks after injurybya blinded observeraspublished previously 32 . Animals were given30min to acclimate to the plexiglass cage before testing ( Ugo Basile ) . The infrared radi - ation source ( intensity 5 58 ) was carefully placed under each hindpaw . Time to withdrawal was recorded as an average of five trials on each paw , with the longest and shortest time removed . Mechanical allodynia . The Von Frey hair protocol for the hind paw was adapted from the Ohio State University Spinal Cord Injury Program . Briefly , animals satisfyingtheweight - bearingcriteriawereacclimatedtotheVonFreytestingboxes foratleast15min . Atotaloftentrialswereperformedstartingwiththe5 . 18mono - filament while animals were distracted with a treat . The monofilament was tested on the plantar surface of the centre of the paw between the foot pads . A positive responsewasrecorded if an animal withdrewitspawwhen themonofilament was presented . At least 30s elapsed between each trial for the same hind paw . Positive responsesledustotestwithprogressivelysmallermonofilaments . Conversely , nega - tive responses led us to test with progressively larger monofilaments until mono - filament 6 . 10 . The threshold value was defined as the lowest monofilament level at which 50 % or more of the trials resulted in a positive withdrawal . Metabolic cage micturition analysis . At6 weeksand12 weeks after SCI , animals were placed in a metabolic cage ( Braintree Scientific ) for measurement of voiding patterns . Thevoidedurinewasmeasuredcontinuouslyviaaforcetransducer / strain gauge ( Grass Technologies ) and plotted in Spike2 ( Cambridge Electrical Design , sampled at 20Hz ) . Animals were kept in this cage for 16h with ample water and food during the period of urine collection and measurement . The criteria for the micturition pattern analysis included void frequency ( voids per h ) and the void volume ( mlpervoid ) . Thetotalvolumeofexpelledurinewasnotincludedbecause of variations in water intake between individual animals . n 5 11 naive animals . Urodynamics . Terminal urodynamic recordings were performed similarly to as described previously 33 . Briefly , rats were anaesthetized at 14 weeks after SCI with 0 . 8gkg 2 1 urethanedeliveredsubcutaneously . Apolyethylene - 50catheterwascare - fully inserted through the urethra into the bladder for delivery of saline .
