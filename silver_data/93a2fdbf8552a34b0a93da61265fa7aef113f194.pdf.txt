The DMT lumen is lined with an interconnected network of 4 microtubule inner proteins ( MIPs ) , some conserved and others lineage - specific . MIPs augment 5 the tubulin lattice of the DMT , directly impacting stability , fine structure , and motility , thus 6 providing an important source of lineage - specific adaptations . Trypanosoma brucei is a 7 flagellated eukaryotic pathogen with distinctive motility that is critical for pathogen transmission 8 and pathogenesis . Prior studies revealed lineage - specific T . brucei MIPs , but their identities are 9 unknown . To identify T . brucei MIPs , we examined flagellum structure and composition following 10 knockdown of FAP106 , a conserved MIP at the inner junction ( IJ ) connecting A - and B - 11 microtubules of the DMT . FAP106 knockdown resulted in short flagella and defective parasite 12 motility , supporting a role for MIPs in T . brucei flagellum stability and motility . Cryogenic electron 13 tomography ( cryoET ) and quantitative proteomics identified several conserved MIPs and 14 lineage - specific MIP structures and MIP candidate proteins ( MCs ) that depend on FAP106 for 15 stable assembly . We further demonstrate by knockdown and fitting AlphaFold models to cryoET 16 maps that one of these , MC8 , is a newly identified lineage - specific MIP required for normal 17 parasite motility . This work provides an important advance toward elucidating the order of 18 assembly of MIPs at the cilium inner junction and identifies trypanosome proteins specific to 19 these deadly pathogens that represent targets to consider for therapeutic intervention . 20 21 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT 22 Motility characteristics of cilia / flagella differ dramatically between species to accommodate 23 organism - specific motility needs .

The flagellated parasite , Trypanosoma brucei , exhibits many unique motility 26 features considered important for moving through host tissues to cause disease , but identities of 27 parasite - specific MIPs are unknown . Here , we combine structural biology , mutant analysis , and 28 quantitative proteomics to identify lineage - specific MIPs in T . brucei . We demonstrate that the 29 conserved MIP , FAP106 , is required for motility and stable assembly of several other MIPs , 30 including trypanosome - specific MIPs required for motility . Our studies advance fundamental 31 understanding of MIP assembly mechanisms , while identifying parasite - specific proteins as 32 potential targets for therapeutic intervention . 33 34 INTRODUCTION 35 Cilia ( synonymous with eukaryotic flagella ) are conserved , microtubule - based structures that 36 provide motility and signaling functions at the surface of eukaryotic cells . Cilium motility is 37 required for normal human reproduction , development , physiology , and to combat infection ( 1 ) . 38 Motile cilia also drive cell propulsion in eukaryotic pathogens responsible for tremendous human 39 suffering worldwide ( 2 , 3 ) . Given this broad distribution and central importance to eukaryote cell 40 biology and human health , understanding structural foundations of cilium assembly and motility 41 is of broad interest . 42 Most motile cilia are built around a " 9 + 2 " cylindrical axoneme consisting of nine doublet 43 microtubules ( DMTs ) surrounding a central pair of singlet microtubules . Each DMT is comprised 44 of a complete , 13 - protofilament A - microtubule ( A - tubule ) and a partial , 10 - protofilament B - 45 microtubule ( B - tubule ) , with non - tubulin proteins forming an “inner junction” ( IJ ) filament that 46 connects the A - and B - tubules ( 4 , 5 ) . Recent studies have revealed a previously unappreciated , 47 yet universal feature of motile axonemes , showing that DMTs are not hollow but , instead , are 48 lined with a highly organized network of interconnected “microtubule inner proteins” ( MIPs ) ( 6 - 49 ( which was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder .

Structures inside DMTs had been reported several decades ago in flagellated protozoa ( 10 , 50 11 ) , but the diversity and ubiquitous distribution of such structures was not recognized until 51 cryogenic electron tomography ( cryoET ) enabled high - resolution , 3D structural analysis ( 8 , 12 ) . 52 Studies in organisms from diverse eukaryotic lineages ( 13 - 16 ) indicate MIPs are present in both 53 the A - and B - tubules and occur in a regularly repeating pattern along the length of the DMT in 54 all motile axonemes . Their broad taxonomic distribution indicates MIPs are fundamentally 55 important for axoneme function and likely were present prior to eukaryote diversification . 56 Meanwhile absence of regularly spaced MIP structures in non - motile cilia ( 17 , 18 ) suggests they 57 are required specifically for motile axonemes . Pioneering work in Chlamydomonas and 58 Tetrahymena demonstrated they can enhance DMT stability and influence beating of the 59 axoneme ( 19 , 20 ) . MIPs have also been shown to affect tubulin dimer packing and protofilament 60 spacing ( 13 , 14 , 16 ) , axoneme curvature ( 14 , 20 , 21 ) , and outer dynein assembly ( 13 , 16 , 22 ) . 61 Nonetheless , many aspects of MIP functions remain poorly understood . 62 In recent , groundbreaking work , cryogenic electron microscopy ( cryoEM ) was used to 63 reconstruct near - atomic resolution structures of the axoneme , thereby allowing in situ 64 identification and atomic modeling of MIPs in Chlamydomonas , Tetrahymena , and mammals 65 ( 13 , 16 , 21 , 23 ) . These studies have expanded opportunities for studying MIP function and 66 revealed that while some MIPs are conserved across diverse taxa , others represent lineage - 67 specific adaptations ( 13 , 16 , 21 , 23 ) . Axonemes of diverse organisms share general architecture 68 and beating mechanism , and lineage - specific MIPs therefore offer a potential mechanism for 69 meeting organism - specific motility characteristics ( 2 , 15 , 24 ) , such as those presented by 70 movement of parasitic protozoa through tissues of their human and animal hosts ( 25 , 26 ) . 71 Identification and analysis of lineage - specific MIPs are therefore of great interest . 72 African trypanosomes , e . g . Trypanosoma brucei and related kinetoplastids , are 73 flagellated , protozoan pathogens that cause extensive human suffering and limit economic 74 ( which was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder .

Trypanosomes also represent 75 diverse eukaryotic lineages that have proven useful for uncovering novel features of eukaryote 76 biology ( 29 , 30 ) . T . brucei motility exhibits several distinctive features that support movement 77 through host tissues ( 15 , 31 ) and is required for pathogenesis ( 32 ) and transmission ( 33 ) . The 78 T . brucei flagellum has a large and diverse repertoire of MIP structures , including several that 79 are lineage - specific , particularly in the B - tubule ( 15 ) . Except for a few conserved examples , 80 however , proteins comprising most T . brucei MIP structures are unknown , representing a critical 81 knowledge gap in T . brucei flagellum assembly and motility . 82 We sought to identify T . brucei MIPs , with a focus on those that are lineage - specific . 83 Loss of one MIP often compromises additional MIPs ( 20 , 21 , 34 , 35 ) , and our strategy was 84 therefore to identify proteins altered upon disruption of a known MIP . We selected FAP106 , a B - 85 tubule MIP that spans the IJ , interconnects other MIPs in Chlamydomonas , Tetrahymena , and 86 mammals ( 13 , 16 , 21 , 35 ) , and may contact several lineage - specific MIP structures in T . brucei 87 ( 15 ) . Requirement of FAP106 for IJ or MIP assembly has not been tested in any organism . By 88 RNAi depletion , we show that T . brucei FAP106 is required for parasite motility and normal 89 flagellum length . CryoET and tandem mass tag ( TMT ) quantitative proteomics together show 90 that FAP106 knockdown ( KD ) results in loss of conserved IJ MIP structures and their 91 corresponding proteins , as well as additional MIP structures and proteins corresponding to 92 lineage - specific MIP candidates ( MCs ) . One of these candidates , MC8 , was confirmed by 93 cryoET to be a novel lineage - specific T . brucei MIP and is required for normal motility . Together , 94 our results demonstrate that FAP106 is a critical interaction hub required for stable assembly of 95 conserved and lineage - specific MIPs at the inner junction . This work advances understanding of 96 MIP assembly mechanisms and provides insight into parasite - specific MIPs that control T . 97 brucei motility . Because they are not present in the mammalian host , such MIPs are attractive 98 for consideration as targets for therapeutic intervention in trypanosome infections . 99 ( which was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder .

The IJ filament proteins , PACRG and FAP20 ( 4 , 103 5 ) , are also conserved . FAP45 and FAP52 sit adjacent to the IJ and are required for DMT 104 stability ( 16 , 19 , 21 ) . FAP106 forms a ‘tether loop’ structure that spans the inner junction and is 105 interconnected with several other MIPs ( 13 , 16 , 21 , 35 ) , although the requirement for FAP106 in 106 MIP and IJ assembly has not been tested . We used tetracycline - inducible RNAi ( 36 ) to deplete 107 FAP106 in procyclic form cells , hereafter referred to as “FAP106 KD” . RNAi knockdown reduced 108 FAP106 mRNA expression by more than 95 % ( Fig . 1A ) without affecting parasite growth rate 109 ( Fig . 1B ) . FAP106 KD parasites did not exhibit any gross morphological defects , although their 110 flagella were shorter than normal ( Fig . 1C - E ) . Notably , despite having a beating flagellum , 111 FAP106 KD parasites rarely exhibited directional motility , even at high cell densities , which 112 typically result in faster directional motility ( Fig . 1F - G ; Supp . Fig . S1 ) . Thus , FAP106 is critical 113 for normal parasite motility . 114 FAP106 is required for stable assembly of IJ MIPs and other MIP structures . 115 To determine whether FAP106 is required for assembly of other MIP structures , we performed 116 cryoET on purified , demembranated flagella from control and FAP106 KD parasites . Most 117 known MIPs assemble with a periodicity of 16 , or 48 nm ( 9 , 13 - 16 , 21 , 23 , 35 , 37 ) and we 118 therefore performed subtomogram averaging to determine the 48 - nm repeating unit of the DMT 119 ( Fig . 2 ; Supp . Fig . S2 ; Movie 1 ) for comparison to the published structures of the 48 - nm repeat 120 from other organisms ( 13 , 16 , 21 ) . MIP densities in the A - tubule appeared largely unaffected in 121 the FAP106 KD and , given the position of FAP106 in the B - tubule , we focused our analysis on 122 the B - tubule . Cross - sectional views of the cryoET tomogram show several major B - tubule MIP 123 ( which was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder . All rights reserved .

Although we do not have sufficient resolution to 124 identify the corresponding proteins directly , referencing the position of MIPs conserved in other 125 organisms provides insight . Longitudinal and cross - sectional views ( Fig . 2C - D ; Movie 1 ) show 126 loss of densities corresponding to the ‘tether loop’ structure of FAP106 in algae and mammals 127 ( 13 , 16 , 21 ) ( Fig . 2B - C , red ) , consistent with the idea that FAP106 structure is conserved across 128 species ( 13 ) . A density corresponding to the expected position of FAP52 ( 16 , 19 , 21 ) appears 129 largely unaffected in the FAP106 KD ( Fig . 2B - D , tan ; Movie 1 ) . We did not resolve filamentous 130 densities corresponding to FAP45 on protofilaments B6 - B9 in other organisms ( 13 , 16 ) , but 131 these protofilaments were heavily decorated in T . brucei control cells and relatively devoid of 132 MIP densities in FAP106 KD ( Fig . 2D ; Movie 1 ) . Additionally , densities corresponding to the 133 expected position of the FAP45 N - terminus are reduced in the FAP106 KD ( Fig . 2D , orange ) . 134 Thus , FAP106 appears to be required for proper assembly of FAP45 but not FAP52 . 135 Interestingly , the FAP106 KD also shows loss of FAP106 - associated densities that resemble 136 FAP210 in other organisms ( Fig . 2B , 2D , green ; ( 13 , 16 , 21 , 35 ) ) , although T . brucei lacks a 137 clear FAP210 homolog ( Table 1 ) . Overall , our results indicate FAP106 is critical for stable 138 assembly of a subset of B - tubule MIP structures in the vicinity of the IJ . 139 Beyond known MIP structures defined in other organisms , additional densities reduced 140 in the FAP106 KD correspond to MIP structures that are absent in one or more other organisms . 141 These lineage - specific MIP structures include a protruding density on protofilament B8 , “MIP 142 B8” , densities attached to protofilament A12 , “MIP A12” , and a protruding density on 143 protofilament B5 , “MIP B5” ( Fig . 2B ) . A density with location and periodicity similar to MIP B8 is 144 present in Tetrahymena ( 9 , 23 , 35 , 37 ) , but not in Chlamydomonas or mammals ( 13 , 16 ) . MIP 145 A12 densities ( Fig . 2B - C ) are not present in Chlamydomonas or mammals ( 13 , 16 , 21 ) and 146 appear more prominent in T . brucei than MIP5a and MIP5b located at a similar position in 147 Tetrahymena ( 9 , 23 , 35 , 37 ) . A density analogous to MIP B5 is not observed in any other 148 ( which was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder . All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Thus , FAP106 is required for stable assembly of 149 universally - conserved , as well as lineage - specific MIPs . 150 FAP106 is required for assembly of a subset of PACRG subunits into the IJ filament . 151 The IJ filament is a conserved non - tubulin structure that connects protofilaments A1 and B10 in 152 organisms with cilia ( 8 , 18 ) . The IJ filament is comprised of PACRG and FAP20 subunits that 153 alternate each 4nm along the axoneme ( 4 , 5 ) . Interestingly , most organisms have a single hole 154 in the IJ filament every 96nm , corresponding to one missing PACRG subunit per 96 - nm 155 repeating unit ( 8 , 12 , 37 ) . T . brucei is unusual in having two holes per 96 - nm repeating unit ( 15 ) 156 ( Fig . 2E ) . The function of the IJ hole is not known , nor is the structural basis for the presence of 157 two holes per 96nm in T . brucei . Strikingly , our cryoET data show that loss of FAP106 results in 158 two additional holes per 48 - nm repeat , giving six holes per 96 - nm repeat ( Fig . 2E ) . These holes 159 correspond to loss of every fourth subunit of the IJ filament ( light blue in Fig . 2E ) , which , based 160 on analogy with Chlamydomonas ( 16 ) , likely corresponds to PACRG . 161 TMT proteomics identifies novel , lineage - specific MIPs . 162 To identify proteins corresponding to FAP106 - dependent MIP densities , we used tandem mass 163 tag ( TMT ) quantitative proteomics to compare the protein composition of purified , 164 demembranated flagella from control and FAP106 KD parasites . We quantified more than 2500 165 proteins and only eight of these were significantly reduced in flagella from FAP106 KD parasites 166 ( > 2 - fold reduced , adjusted p - value < 0 . 06 ) ( Fig . 3A ; Table 2 ; Supp . Dataset S1 ) . Three proteins 167 were observed to be increased in the knockdown ( Fig . 3A ; Supp . Dataset S1 ) and were not 168 studied further . 169 As expected , the protein most reduced in FAP106 KD parasites was FAP106 itself ( Fig . 170 3A ; Table 2 ) , confirming efficient knockdown reported by qRT - PCR ( Fig . 1A ) and loss of 171 FAP106 protein from the axoneme ( Fig . 2 ) . Two other characterized proteins , FAP45 and 172 ( which was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder . All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

FAP45 was almost 4 - fold 173 reduced in FAP106 KD flagella ( Fig . 3A ; Table 2 ) , supporting results from cryoET indicating 174 FAP106 is required for stable assembly of FAP45 into the axoneme ( Fig . 2 ) . FAP52 and FAP20 175 were unaffected ( Supp . Dataset S1 ) , further supporting conclusions from cryoET that these 176 proteins assemble independently of FAP106 ( Fig . 2 ) . Notably , T . brucei has two PACRG 177 homologs , PACRG - A and PACRG - B ( Table 1 ) , which have been suggested to be functionally 178 redundant ( 38 , 39 ) . Despite a high degree of similarity , however , PACRG - A and PACRG - B are 179 readily distinguishable by mass spectrometry and our TMT proteomics analysis shows that only 180 PACRG - B is lost in the FAP106 KD ( Fig . 3A ; Table 2 ; Supp . Dataset S1 ) . Loss of PACRG - B 181 and not PACRG - A indicates that the extra holes in the FAP106 KD ( Fig . 2E ) correspond to 182 missing PACRG - B subunits and demonstrates that PACRG - A and PACRG - B are not redundant . 183 Based on spacing of IJ subunits , the two IJ holes in control parasites most likely also 184 correspond to missing PACRG - B . 185 The identity of proteins corresponding to FAP106 - dependent MIP densities that are 186 lineage - specific ( Fig . 2 ) are unknown . In addition to the known MIPs described above , five 187 previously uncharacterized proteins were reduced in flagella from FAP106 KD parasites ( Fig . 188 3A ; Table 2 ) . One of these proteins ( RPC19 , Tb927 . 11 . 8890 ) localizes to the nucleus ( 40 ) , 189 suggesting it is unlikely to be a MIP . The remaining four proteins ( Tb927 . 10 . 7120 , 190 Tb927 . 11 . 4920 , Tb927 . 11 . 2770 , and Tb927 . 3 . 3200 ) , which are kinetoplastid - specific and 191 localize to the flagellum ( Supp . Fig . S3A ; ( 40 ) ) , are strong candidates for lineage - specific , 192 FAP106 - dependent MIPs . Importantly , these four proteins were also identified as “MIP 193 candidates” , MC3 , MC5 , MC8 , and MC15 , in a completely independent APEX2 - based proximity 194 proteomics analysis as being nearby FAP45 and FAP52 in the B - tubule ( Supp . Fig . S4 ; Supp . 195 Dataset S2 ) . Identification of these four proteins by independent approaches greatly supports 196 their potential as novel , kinetoplastid - specific MIPs . 197 ( which was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder .

Fig . S3A ) without substantial 200 effects on parasite growth . Loss of MC5 did not affect parasite motility , while MC3 , MC8 , and 201 MC15 are each required for normal motility ( Fig . 3C ; Supp . Fig . S3B ) . MC8 KD and MC15 KD 202 parasites also showed small reductions in flagellum length ( Fig . 3D ; Supp . Fig . S3C ) . To ask 203 whether additional proteins depend on these MCs for assembly into the axoneme , we 204 performed TMT proteomics on flagella isolated from parasites in which the individual MCs were 205 knocked down ( Supp . Fig . S3D - G ; Supp . Dataset S1 ) . These proteomic analyses confirm 206 significant reduction of each MC in the respective knockdown , but no additional proteins were 207 lost ( > 2 - fold reduced , adjusted p - value < 0 . 06 ) in any of the four knockdowns ( Supp . Fig . S3D - G , 208 Supp . Dataset S1 ) . Therefore , motility defects in MC3 , MC8 , and MC15 knockdowns reflect a 209 requirement for these individual , kinetoplastid - specific proteins in trypanosome motility . 210 MC8 is a novel , lineage - specific T . brucei MIP that comprises the MIP B8 density . 211 To identify MIPs corresponding to FAP106 - dependent MIP densities , we fit the AlphaFold ( 41 , 212 42 ) models of the above MCs into our cryoET structures . AlphaFold prediction of individual 213 proteins returned low - confidence predictions for MC3 , MC5 , and MC15 , but predicted that MC8 214 folds into a structure with a high - confidence pyramid - like domain formed by α helices ( Fig . 4A ) , 215 which fits well into the MIP B8 density ( Fig . 4B ) . To determine whether MC8 in fact corresponds 216 to the MIP B8 density , we performed cryoET on purified , demembranated flagella from control 217 and MC8 KD parasites ( Fig . 4C - E ) . Because TMT analysis showed that MC8 is the only protein 218 lost in the MC8 KD ( Supp . Fig . S3F ; Supp . Dataset S1 ) , any density altered in the knockdown 219 must correspond to MC8 itself . The subtomographic average of the 48 - nm repeating unit from 220 MC8 KD axonemes was nearly identical to that of controls except for the absence of the MIP B8 221 density ( Fig . 4C - E ) . Thus , MC8 is a bona fide , T . brucei - specific B - tubule MIP that is required for 222 ( which was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder . All rights reserved .

Fig . S3B ) . The motility defect of MC8 KD parasites , in 223 which the only missing protein is MC8 , demonstrates importance of lineage - specific MIPs to 224 flagellar motility . 225 226 DISCUSSION 227 FAP106 knockdown provides insights into MIP assembly mechanisms . 228 Functional analysis lags behind identification and structural assignment of MIP proteins . Here 229 we combine functional , structural , and proteomic analysis to demonstrate that the MIP FAP106 230 is required for motility and is a key interaction hub of the IJ and B - tubule MIP structures . The 231 role of FAP106 as a key interaction hub is emphasized by our finding that , while FAP106 is 232 required for stable assembly of FAP45 and lineage - specific MIP proteins MC3 , 5 , 8 , and 15 ( Fig . 233 2 ; Fig . 3 , Fig . 5 ) , loss of these individual proteins does not affect other MIP proteins or 234 structures ( Supp . Fig . 3D - G ; Fig . 4 ; Supp . Dataset S1 ; ( 19 ) ) . Thus , rather than interdependency , 235 our results suggest a hierarchical mechanism for B - tubule MIP assembly . FAP106 - dependency 236 of FAP45 and a FAP210 structural homolog suggests that extensive interactions of FAP45 and 237 FAP210 with the tubulin lattice ( 13 , 16 ) are relatively weak , while interactions with FAP106 ( 13 ) 238 are critical for stable binding and establishing their periodicity within the 48 - nm repeat . This 239 supports the idea that an important role of MIPs is to enable complex assembly of proteins 240 along otherwise uniform protofilament polymers of tubulin ( 14 ) and suggests that loss of FAP45 241 and FAP210 in RIB72 mutants ( 34 ) may reflect dependency on FAP106 rather than a 242 requirement for RIB72 directly . Our studies also provide a structural explanation for motility 243 defects of FAP106 mutants in trypanosomes ( Fig . 2 ) , and in sperm from FAP106 / ENKUR 244 mutants in mice ( 43 ) . 245 ( which was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder .

One of the more 248 mysterious features of DMTs is a hole in the IJ filament that occurs once per 96 - nm repeat in 249 most organisms and corresponds to a missing PACRG ( 8 , 12 , 37 ) . T . brucei is unusual in 250 having two IJ holes per 96 - nm repeat , one at the site of NDRC attachment as observed in other 251 organisms , and one proximal to the NDRC ( 15 ) . The proximal hole is devoid of external 252 structures on the DMT ( 15 ) , suggesting it is dictated by MIP interactions rather than NDRC 253 attachment , which is proposed for the NDRC hole ( 44 ) . Our findings support this idea , as loss of 254 specific MIPs results in extra holes in the IJ filament . Some organisms have multiple PACRG 255 homologs ( 23 , 38 , 45 ) , but the contribution of individual homologs is unknown . It is not known , 256 for example , if they are distinctly incorporated within a single axoneme or used for specialization 257 of axoneme function in different cell types or developmental stages . T . brucei has two PACRG 258 homologs , PACRG - A and PACRG - B , which have been suggested to be functionally redundant 259 ( 38 , 39 ) . Our structural and proteomics data instead support a model in which PACRG - A and 260 PACRG - B subunits both regularly assemble within each IJ filament , alternating with FAP20 in 261 turn , and with holes in the IJ filament corresponding to missing PACRG - B , but not PACRG - A 262 subunits ( Fig . 2E ) . Distinct locations and assembly requirements for PACRG - A and PACRG - B 263 indicate they play distinct roles in assembly of the IJ . Although PACRG is conserved among 264 ciliated organisms , the family of PACRG proteins shows substantial heterogeneity in the N - 265 terminal region that has been shown to interact closely with the DMT lattice in Chlamydomonas 266 ( 21 , 45 ) . Divergent N - termini of PACRG - A versus PACRG - B may contribute to the differential 267 dependence on FAP106 and their distinct roles in assembly of the IJ . 268 MC8 is a novel , lineage - specific T . brucei MIP that is required for normal parasite motility . 269 ( which was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder .

FAP45 , FAP52 , and FAP106 represent core B - tubule MIPs while FAP126 , 272 FAP276 , and FAP210 are only found in some organisms ( Table 1 ) . We demonstrate that MC8 is 273 a bona fide lineage - specific MIP corresponding to the MIP B8 structure ( Fig . 4 ) . Loss of MC8 in 274 the FAP106 KD ( Fig . 2B - 2D ) is likely due to loss of FAP45 , which runs along protofilaments B7 - 275 B8 ( 13 , 16 ) and contacts FAP106 directly ( 13 ) . Loss of MC8 compromises motility ( Fig . 3C ; 276 Supp . Fig . 3B ) without affecting other MIPs ( Fig . 4 , Supp . Fig . 3F ) , demonstrating that lineage - 277 specific MIPs directly impact trypanosome motility . Validation of MC8 as a bona fide T . brucei 278 MIP in the current study , through a combination of mutant analysis , structural , functional , and 279 proximity proteomics approaches , demonstrates the power of this combined approach for MIP 280 identification and analysis . Our studies also strongly suggest that MC3 , 5 , and 15 likewise 281 correspond to novel , lineage - specific T . brucei MIPs . Trypanosome motility is necessary for 282 virulence in the mammalian host ( 32 ) and transmission through the tsetse fly vector ( 33 ) . 283 Therefore , identification of novel , trypanosome - specific MIPs provides attractive targets to 284 consider for treatment of devastating diseases caused by these pathogens . 285 Model for assembly of the IJ 286 Our work provides an important advance toward elucidating the order of MIP assembly and 287 supports the following model for IJ assembly ( Fig . 5 ) . FAP20 binds every 8 nm , together with at 288 least a subset of PACRG , to form the IJ filament and this occurs independently from assembly 289 of FAP52 ( 21 ) and FAP106 ( this work ) . FAP52 binds every 16 nm , independently of the IJ 290 filament ( 4 ) and FAP106 ( this work ) , and may connect the IJ filament to the B - tubule via 291 FAP276 or other analogous structure ( 21 , 35 ) . FAP106 also binds every 16 nm , independently 292 from FAP52 ( 21 ) , bridging the A - and B - tubules directly and serving as a critical guidepost for 293 assembling additional MIPs such as FAP45 and FAP210 ( this work ) .

Despite apparent contacts between FAP52 and other IJ MIPs ( 13 , 16 , 21 , 35 ) , assembly of 296 IJ MIPs in Chlamydomonas is largely unaffected by loss of FAP52 ( 21 ) . Thus , while FAP52 and 297 FAP106 form contacts with each other and other IJ MIPs , they assemble independently from 298 one another , and FAP106 appears to be more critical for assembly of additional B - tubule MIPs . 299 Going forward , as additional MIPs are identified , particularly those that are lineage - specific , 300 application of combined proteomics , cryoEM , and mutant analysis , as done here , will be 301 necessary to completely define MIP assembly mechanisms and to yield a full understanding of 302 their contribution to flagellum function . 303 304 MATERIALS AND METHODS 305 Trypanosoma brucei culture 306 Procyclic T . brucei brucei ( strain 29 - 13 ) ( 46 ) were cultivated in SM medium ( 47 ) supplemented 307 with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) at 28°C with 5 % CO 2 . 308 In situ tagging 309 mNeonGreen and APEX2 - tagged cell lines were generated in the 29 - 13 background by C - 310 terminal tagging ( 40 ) with pPOTv6 - puro - puro - mNG or pPOTv7 - blast - blast - APEX2 - 3xHA , 311 respectively . pPOTv7 - blast - blast - APEX2 - 3xHA contains the same APEX2 - 3xHA tag as in ( 48 ) . 312 For MC3 - NG , a transient CRISPR - Cas9 system ( 49 ) was used to tag both alleles . See Supp . 313 Table S2 for list of primers . 314 Tetracycline - inducible knockdown 315 Constructs for tetracycline - inducible knockdown were designed using RNAit ( 50 ) and cloned 316 into p2T7 - 177 ( 36 ) . See Supp . Table S2 for list of primers . NotI - linearized plasmids were 317 transfected into 29 - 13 ( FAP106 KD ) or the corresponding MC - NG tagged cell lines ( MC KDs ) 318 using established methods ( 47 ) .

For growth curves , cells were counted with a Beckman Coulter Z1 particle counter and 322 diluted daily to a concentration of 1e6 cells / mL , in triplicate . 323 qRT - PCR 324 Quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) was performed as previously described ( 51 ) with the 325 following modifications . FAP106 - specific primers were designed using RNAit ( 50 ) . Analyses 326 were performed in duplicate on three independent RNA preparations and values were 327 normalized to RPS23 ( 52 ) . See Supp . Table S2 for list of primers . 328 Motility analyses 329 Cells were grown to ~ 1e6 cells / mL and loaded into polyglutamate - coated motility chambers ( 32 ) 330 sealed with Vaseline . 30s videos were acquired under dark - field illumination at ~ 40 frames per 331 second ( fps ) using a Hamamatsu ORCA - Flash 4 . 0 camera on a Zeiss Axio Imager A2 inverted 332 microscope with an EC Plan - Neofluar 10x / 0 . 3 objective lens and Zen 2 . 6 Pro software . At least 333 five videos were collected for each independent biological replicate . Single cell tracking and 334 mean squared displacement were performed in MATLAB as previously described for fluorescent 335 parasites ( 32 ) . For ‘high density’ motility analyses , cells were grown to ~ 1e7 cell / mL , then 336 diluted in conditioned medium to ~ 1e6 cells / mL and analyzed as above . 337 Purification of demembranated flagella ( detergent - extracted flagellum skeletons ) 338 Detergent extraction was done to demembranate flagellum skeletons , essentially as described 339 ( 15 ) . Briefly , cells were washed in Dulbecco’s PBS ( DPBS ) , resuspended in Extraction buffer 340 ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % NP40 , 2x Sigmafast EDTA - free 341 protease inhibitor cocktail ) for 15 min at room temperature , followed by depolymerization of 342 subpellicular microtubules with 1 mM CaCl 2 on ice for 30 min . Detergent - extracted flagellum 343 skeletons were pelleted at 1500 rcf for 10 min at 4°C . 344 Flagellum length measurements 345 ( which was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder .

For 348 measurements of the paraflagellar rod ( PFR ) in detergent - extracted cytoskeletons , cells were 349 washed in Dulbecco’s PBS ( DPBS ) and allowed to adhere to glass cover slips for 10 min . Cover 350 slips were rinsed to remove unattached cells , then extracted with PEME buffer ( 100 mM PIPES , 351 2 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgSO 4 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , pH 6 . 8 ) + 1 % IGEPAL CA - 630 ( NP40 ) + 2x 352 Sigmafast EDTA - free protease inhibitor cocktail for 10 min . Cover slips were fixed in methanol 353 at - 20°C for 10 min , allowed to dry , then rehydrated in DPBS for 15 min . Cover slips were 354 blocked in DPBS + 8 % normal donkey serum + 2 % bovine serum albumin then incubated in 355 rabbit anti - PFR2 ( 53 ) primary antibody diluted 1 : 1000 in blocking solution , followed by donkey 356 anti - rabbit Alexa 594 secondary antibody diluted 1 : 1500 in blocking solution . Cover slips were 357 mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI and images were acquired on a Zeiss Axioskop II 358 fluorescence microscope with a Plan - Apochromat 100x / 1 . 4 objective lens and Axiovision or Zen 359 3 . 5 Pro software . Flagellum lengths were measured in Fiji using the freehand line tool and 360 analyzed in GraphPad Prism . 361 CryoET 362 CryoET grids and detergent - extracted flagellum skeletons were prepared essentially as 363 described ( 15 ) . Briefly , 2e8 log phase cells were harvested and washed twice in DPBS . 364 Flagellum skeletons were prepared as described above , resuspended in 100 ul Extraction buffer 365 and spun over a 30 % sucrose cushion in Extraction buffer without NP40 at 800 rcf for 5 min at 366 4°C . 100 - 150 µL of flagellum skeletons were collected from the upper fraction , washed once 367 with 700 ul Extraction buffer , and once with 1 mL Extraction buffer without NP40 . Flagellum 368 skeletons were resuspended in Extraction buffer without NP40 and vitrified on quantifoil grids 369 with 5nm fiducial gold beads . 370 ( which was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder .

Frames in each movie of the raw tilt series were aligned , 373 drift - corrected , and averaged with Motioncor2 ( 55 ) . The micrographs in each tilt series were 374 aligned and reconstructed into 3D tomograms by either weighted back projections ( WBP , for 375 sub - tomographic averaging ) or simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique ( SIRT , for 376 visualization and particle picking ) using the IMOD software package ( 56 ) . The contrast transfer 377 function ( CTF ) was determined by ctffind4 ( 57 ) and corrected with the ctfphaseflip program ( 58 ) 378 of IMOD . 379 Sub - tomogram averaging , visualization and modeling 380 4x binned SIRT reconstructed tomograms were further processed by IsoNet ( 59 ) to improve the 381 contrast for particle picking . Because of their distinct features , radial spokes were picked as 382 particles to represent the centers of 96nm axonemal repeat units . These particles for 96 nm 383 repeat units were subject to three rounds of rough alignments with PEET ( 7 , 60 ) . The particle 384 coordinates for 48 - nm repeat units were generated from the coordinates of the aligned particles 385 for 96 - nm repeat units . While keeping all coordinates for 96 - nm repeat units , extra coordinates 386 for 48 - nm repeat units were added unidirectionally from the 96 - nm - repeat - units coordinates in a 387 distance of 48nm along the axonemal axis . PEET alignments were performed on the particles of 388 48 - nm repeat units to generate the final maps . In Summary , the sub - tomographic averages of 389 flagellar components from four datasets were generated from the following number of particles : 390 1014 particles from 20 tomograms of Control dataset 1 , 728 particles from 18 tomograms of 391 FAP106 KD dataset , 1936 particles from 52 tomograms of MC8 KD dataset , and 538 particles 392 from nine tomograms of Control dataset 2 . The cryoET sub - tomographic averaged maps have 393 been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank under the accession codes EMD - 28802 , 394 EMD - 28803 , EMD - 28804 , and EMD - 28805 , for FAP106 KD , Control 1 , MC8 KD , and Control 2 , 395 ( which was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder .

The resolution of each sub - tomographic average was calculated by 396 calcUnbiasedFSC in PEET based on the 0 . 143 FSC criterion ( Supp . Fig . S2 ) . 397 UCSF ChimeraX ( 61 ) was used to visualize reconstructed tomograms and sub - 398 tomographic averages . For surface rendering with UCSF ChimeraX , maps were first low pass 399 filtered to either 20Å or 30Å . 400 Model prediction of MC8 was performed by AlphaFold Colab ( 41 , 42 ) . AlphaFold 401 predicted model of MC8 was superimposed into our averaged density with the molmap and 402 fitmap functions in UCSF ChimeraX . 403 TMT labeling and quantitative proteomics 404 Detergent - extracted flagellum skeletons were prepared from 2e8 - 4e8 log phase cells as 405 described above . After detergent extraction and depolymerization of subpellicular microtubules , 406 the pellet of flagellum skeletons was washed in Extraction buffer without NP40 and solubilized in 407 100 µl 8M urea , 100 mM Tris , pH 8 for 15 min at room temperature . Samples were centrifuged 408 at full speed for 15 min to pellet any insoluble material . The supernatant was diluted with 100 409 mM Tris , pH 8 to a final concentration of 2M urea and precipitated with 20 % ice - cold 410 trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) on ice overnight . The sample was centrifuged at full speed for 30 min 411 at 4°C and washed twice with - 20°C acetone . The TCA - precipitated pellets were dried and 412 stored at < - 20°C . 413 Sample Digestion : Protein pellets were resuspended with digestion buffer ( 8M urea , 0 . 1M Tris - 414 HCl pH 8 . 5 ) . Each sample was normalized by absorbance at 280 nm and 25μg was aliquoted 415 for the digestion . Samples were reduced and alkylated via sequential 20 - minute incubations 416 with 5 mM TCEP and 10 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature in the dark . Carboxylate - 417 modified magnetic beads ( CMMB ) also known as SP3 ( 62 ) and ethanol ( 50 % final 418 concentration ) were added to each sample to induce protein binding to CMMB beads . CMMB 419 beads were washed three times with 80 % ethanol and then resuspended with 18ul of 100 mM 420 ( which was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder . All rights reserved .

Protein samples were digested overnight with 1ul of 0 . 1μg / ul LysC ( Promega ) and 2ul of 421 0 . 4μg / ul trypsin ( Pierce ) at 37 °C . 422 TMT Labeling and CIF Fractionation : 9ul of 100 % acetonitrile were added to each sample to a 423 final concentration of 30 % ( v / v ) . Then the TMT labels were resuspended with 100 % acetonitrile . 424 25ug of each sample was labeled using TMT6plex ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and the four 425 labeled samples of each set ( two independent biological replicates each of control and 426 knockdown ) were pooled . The pooled samples were fractionated by CMMB - based Isopropanol 427 Gradient Peptide Fractionation ( CIF ) method ( 63 ) into six fractions before mass spectrometry 428 ( MS ) analysis . 429 LC - MS Acquisition and Analysis : Fractionated samples were separated on a 75uM ID x 25cm 430 C18 column packed with 1 . 9μm C18 particles ( Dr . Maisch GmbH ) using a 140 - minute gradient 431 of increasing acetonitrile and eluted directly into a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass 432 spectrometer where MS spectra were acquired using SPS - MS3 . Protein identification was 433 performed using MaxQuant ( 64 ) v 1 . 6 . 17 . 0 . against a user assembled database consisting of all 434 protein entries from the TriTrypDB ( 65 ) for T . brucei strain 927 ( version 7 . 0 ) . Searches were 435 performed using a 20 ppm precursor ion tolerance . TMT6plex was set as a static modification 436 on lysine and peptide N terminal . Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as static 437 modification , while oxidation of methionine residues and N - terminal protein acetylation were set 438 as variable modifications . LysC and Trypsin were selected as enzyme specificity with maximum 439 of two missed cleavages allowed . 1 % false discovery rate was used as a filter at both protein 440 and PSM levels . Statistical analysis was conducted with the MSstatsTMT Bioconductor package 441 ( 66 ) .
