Kiernan 2 , 5 ✉ © The Author ( s ) 2022 The mammalian cochlea is an exceptionally well - organized epithelium composed of hair cells , supporting cells , and innervating neurons . Loss or defects in any of these cell types , particularly the specialized sensory hair cells , leads to deafness . The Notch pathway is known to play a critical role in the decision to become either a hair cell or a supporting cell during embryogenesis ; however , little is known about how Notch functions later during cochlear maturation . Uniquely amongst Notch ligands , Jagged1 ( JAG1 ) is localized to supporting cells during cell fate acquisition and continues to be expressed into adulthood . Here , we demonstrate that JAG1 in maturing cochlear supporting cells is essential for normal cochlear function . Speci ﬁ cally , we show that deletion of JAG1 during cochlear maturation disrupts the inner hair cell pathway and leads to a type of deafness clinically similar to auditory neuropathy . Common pathologies associated with disruptions in inner hair cell function , including loss of hair cells , synapses , or auditory neurons , were not observed in JAG1 mutant cochleae . Instead , RNA - seq analysis of JAG1 - de ﬁ cient cochleae identi ﬁ ed dysregulation of the Rho GTPase pathway , known to be involved in stereocilia development and maintenance . Interestingly , the overexpression of one of the altered genes , Diaph3 , is responsible for autosomal dominant auditory neuropathy - 1 ( AUNA1 ) in humans and mice , and is associated with defects in the inner hair cell stereocilia . Strikingly , ultrastructural analyses of JAG1 - deleted cochleae revealed stereocilia defects in inner hair cells , including fused and elongated bundles , that were similar to those stereocilia defects reported in AUNA1 mice . Taken together , these data indicate a novel role for Notch signaling in normal hearing development through maintaining stereocilia integrity of the inner hair cells during cochlear maturation . Cell Death and Disease ( 2022 ) 13 : 971 ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41419 - 022 - 05380 - w INTRODUCTION The mammalian cochlear epithelia ( the organ of Corti ) is composed of sensory hair cells , supporting cells , and innervating neurons . The hair cells are mechanosensitive cells that display organized , hair - like structures atop their surface called stereocilia . There are two types of hair cells : inner hair cells , which are the primary sensory receptors , and outer hair cells , which amplify the auditory signal . In mammals these cells cannot regenerate ; thus , damage to these cell types leads to deafness . Notch signaling plays multiple essential roles in the embryonic development of the inner ear sensory regions [ 1 , 2 ] . This evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway functions through the interactions of membrane - bound ligands ( Jagged - 1 – 2 , and Delta - like1 , 3 - 4 ) and receptors ( NOTCH1 - 4 ) . These cell - cell interactions trigger the cleavage and subsequent release of the activated form of Notch ( the Notch Intracellular Domain or NICD ) , which translocates to the nucleus and interacts with the effector RBPJ ( RBPj κ or CSL ( CBF1 , Suppressor of Hairless , Lag - 1 ) ) and alters transcription [ 3 , 4 ] . During embryonic inner ear sensory development , Notch signaling functions reiteratively through two distinct signaling modalities : lateral induction and lateral inhibition [ 2 , 5 ] ( 1 ) . Initially , through the process of lateral induction [ 6 ] , Notch signaling , via the JAG1 ligand , establishes the prosensory progenitors that give rise to both hair cells and supporting cells [ 7 – 10 ] . Subsequently , Notch functions during lateral inhibition via the DLL1 and JAG2 ligands , a process that creates the mosaic patterning of hair cells and supporting cells in the cochlea [ 11 – 13 ] . Despite these important early roles for Notch in inner ear development , there is a limited understanding of Notch function after birth during the cochlear maturation period . The continued expression pattern of one of the Notch ligands , JAG1 , after birth and into adulthood , makes it a compelling candidate to function in the maturing cochlea [ 11 , 14 – 16 ] . To investigate the role of the Notch ligand , JAG1 , in the maturing cochlea , we conditionally deleted JAG1 in the early postnatal cochlea . We found that deletion of Jag1 in neonatal supporting cells ( Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ ) resulted in a speci ﬁ c form of hearing loss at 6 weeks that is clinically similar to auditory neuropathy . Histological analyses failed to reveal common defects for the type of hearing loss observed in JAG1 - de ﬁ cient mice , including loss of inner hair cell synapses or auditory neurons .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and tamoxifen treatment All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with guide - lines and regulations of the University of Rochester Medical Center and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health . All animal experiments were approved by the University of Rochester ’ s Committee on Animal Resources . Mouse strains : Sox2 - Cre ERT2 ; C57bl6 / J background [ 17 ] , Jag1 ﬂ ox ; FVB / n background [ 18 ] . PCR primers : Sox2 - Cre ERT2 : CreF ( 5 ’ TGA TGA GGT TCG CAA GAA CC ) and CreR ( 5 ’ CCA TGA GTG AAC GAA CCT GG ) yielding a 350 bp band . Jag1 ﬂ ox : Jag1F ( 5 ’ AGG TTG GCC ACC TCT AAA TC ) and Jag1R ( 5 ’ GCA AGT CTG TCT GCT TTC ATC ) , yielding a 316 bp band . The day of birth was considered postnatal day ( P ) 0 . All pups were given a single intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA ; 75 µg / g body weight ) on ( P ) 0 and P1 . Both Sox2 + / + Jag1 + / ﬂ and Sox2 + / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice were used , and are collectively referred to as Sox2 + / + mice . Sox2 + / + and Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 + / ﬂ littermates are used as controls throughout this study . Animals were collected at either P6 or 6 weeks of age . Mice received food and water ad libitum and were housed on a 12 - h light to dark cycle . The number of biological replicates is reported in the ﬁ gure legend for each analysis and were taken from at least two different litters . Roughly equal numbers of both sexes of mice were used in this study . Animals were randomly assigned to each analysis and no animals were excluded in this study . Auditory testing 6 - week - old mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine ( 80 mg / kg ) in a sterile acepromazine / saline mixture ( 3 mg / kg ) . Auditory testing was conducted using a Smart EP Universal Smart Box ( Intelligent Hearing Systems , Miami , FL , USA ) as previously described [ 19 ] . Tissue preparation and immunostaining Cochleae were ﬁ xed overnight at 4 °C in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX , sc - 281692 ) . Adult tissue was decalci ﬁ ed in 0 . 2 M EDTA ( pH 7 . 3 ) for 14 days at 4 °C . For whole - mount antigen retrieval , dissected cochleae were immersed in 30 % sucrose , ﬂ ash frozen in liquid nitrogen , allowed to thaw , washed in PBS , and blocked for one hour in 1 % Triton X - 100 / 5 % horse serum ( Sigma ) in PBS , and incubated in primary antibodies overnight . Refer to Table S1 for information regarding primary antibodies used in this study . Tissue was subsequently washed in PBS and incubated for two hours at room temperature in Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin ( Invitrogen , A22287 ) , [ 1 : 100 ] ) Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen , ab150073 , ab 11056 , ab21202 , and ab150074 , [ 1 : 1000 ] ) , counterstained with 4 ‘ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) , washed again in PBS and mounted in Fluorogel in Tris buffer ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . Paraf ﬁ n sections Tissue was dehydrated through a series of EtOH washes from 70 % to 100 % , cleared in xylene , embedded in paraf ﬁ n , and sectioned at a thickness of 7µm . Slides were deparaf ﬁ nized through a series of xylene and ethanol washes . Antigen retrieval was performed prior to immunostaining by incubating in 10mM Sodium Citrate Buffer ( pH 6 ) for 20 minutes at 98 °C and incubated overnight in primary and secondary antibodies at 4°C . Frozen sections Tissue was cryoprotected overnight at 4 °C in increasing concentrations of sucrose in PBS up to 30 % , embedded in tissue freezing medium , frozen on dry ice , and sectioned at a thickness of 16 µm . Plastic sections Cochlea were ﬁ xed in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate - buffered 2 . 5 % glutaralde - hyde / 4 % PFA overnight , decalci ﬁ ed for 1 week in 200 mM EDTA ( PH 7 . 4 ) , dehydrated with a series of ethanol washes , embedded in Technovit 7100 hardener ( Kulzer ) , sectioned at 2 . 5 μ m ( HM 355 S Automatic Microtome ) , and stained with hematoxylin and eosin . Imaging All sections were imaged on a Zeiss Axio microscope using Axiovision SE64 software . An Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope ( URMC Center for Advanced Light Microscopy and Nanoscopy ( CALM ) core ) and a Nikon A1 - R confocal microscope with Nikon NIS Elements software were used to capture Z - stack images of labeled cochleae in whole mount . Quanti ﬁ cation Quanti ﬁ cation of hair cells , synapses , and supporting cells were performed on two confocal z - stack images taken from each cochlear region ( apex , middle , base ) ; and cells were manually quanti ﬁ ed in two or three 300 µm segments per region in Af ﬁ nity Photo ( Serif Europe Ltd . ) . Spiral ganglion neurons were quanti ﬁ ed in sections ; a minimum of 30 sections were counted per animal and the area of Rosenthal ’ s canal was measured in the Axiovision SE64 software . The researcher was blinded as to the genotype for the quanti ﬁ cation of all cell types and scoring of ABR / DPOAE thresholds . Statistical analysis Before experiments were conducted , power calculations were performed to determine appropriate sample size and at least three individual mice per genotype were used per analysis . Statistics were performed in Prism9 ( GraphPad ) using standard functions . To ensure appropriate statistical tests were utilized , data from experiments designed to test differences between two groups ( e . g . , SGN ’ s per unit area ( Fig . 3C ) ) were subjected to an F test to compare variance and a Shapiro - Wilk to test normality and were analyzed using unpaired two - tailed Welch ’ s t - test . To ensure appropriate statistical tests were utilized , data from experiments designed to detect differences among multiple groups and across multiple conditions ( e . g . , Auditory thresholds at multiple frequencies ( Fig . 2A , B ) , ABR wave I absolute latencies at multiple sound pressure levels ( Fig . 3D ) , IHC and OHC # ’ s at 6 weeks ( Fig . 4I ) , quanti ﬁ cation of synaptic components at multiple frequencies ( Fig . 4J – L ) , ABR wave I amplitudes at increasing sound pressure levels ( Fig . S2B ) , and quanti ﬁ cation of hair cell and supporting cell subtypes at P6 ( Fig . S3I ) ) were analyzed using a two - way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni ’ s post hoc tests . For these statistical tests , every possible comparison was made when relevant , and multiplicity adjusted P values are reported . In all cases , data met the assumptions of the statistical test used . P values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . Center values for each graph are de ﬁ ned as the mean and error bars are de ﬁ ned in each ﬁ gure legend . RNA - seq All pups were given a single intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA ; 75 µg / g body weight ) on ( P ) 0 and P1 . Cochlear tissues from P6 Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ and Sox2 + / + littermate controls ( n = 6 each ) were dissected in ice - cold DEPC - treated PBS and stored in RNAlater ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) at 4 °C . RNAs were puri ﬁ ed by RNeasy Micro Kit ( QIAGEN , Hilden , Germany ) . RNA quality and quantity was measured by a 2100 bioanalyzer ( Agilent , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . All RNAs had an RNA Integrity Number ( RIN ) value of 9 . 7 – 10 . Illumina - compatible sequencing libraries were generated by the University of Rochester Genomics Research Center . Libraries were hybridized to the Illumina ﬂ ow cell and single - end reads of 100nts were generated . Identi ﬁ cation of signi ﬁ cantly differentially expressed genes was determined using DeSeq2 ( Bioconductor ) . The analysis package Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( IPA ; QIAGEN ) was used to determine whether particular pathways were signi ﬁ cantly affected by the loss of JAG1 . Scanning electron microscopy Cochleae were ﬁ xed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hat ﬁ eld , PA , USA ) in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation and processed using the OTOTO protocol [ 20 ] . Samples were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol and critical point dried before mounting . Imaging was carried out on a JEOL 6700 F scanning electron microscope , operating at 5 kV in secondary electron detection mode . F . A . Gilels et al . 2 Cell Death and Disease ( 2022 ) 13 : 971 RESULTSDeletion of the Notch ligand JAG1 in maturing supporting cells To understand the role of JAG1 in the maturing cochlea , JAG1 was conditionally deleted in neonatal cochlear supporting cells using the tamoxifen - inducible Sox2 CreER mouse line [ 17 ] crossed to a Jag1 ﬂ ox allele [ 18 ] . In the mouse cochlea , Sox2 CreER is expressed in all supporting cell subtypes [ 21 ] , while JAG1 is localized to inner phalangeal cells , pillar cells and Deiters ’ cells [ 16 , 22 ] ( Fig . 1A , C , red ) . Offspring from Sox2 CreER Jag1 + / ﬂ and Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ crosses were injected with tamoxifen at postnatal day ( P ) 0 and P1 ( Fig . 1B ) [ 23 ] , a time when hair cells and supporting cells are maturing . Sox2 + / + mice referred to in this study are littermate controls . To determine the ef ﬁ ciency of deletion , immunohistochemistry was performed at 6 weeks to detect JAG1 protein . Results showed that JAG1 was largely undetectable by immunohistochemistry at 6 weeks ( Fig . 1D , red ) , indicating that deletion was ef ﬁ cient . To determine how fast the deletion and protein reduction occurred , we performed immunohistochemistry at P6 . In controls at P6 , JAG1 is localized to supporting cells , including the greater epithelial ridge ( GER ) , pillar cells and Deiters ’ cells ( Fig . S1A , C , red ) . In Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ cochleae at P6 , signi ﬁ cant downregulation of JAG1 protein was observed in all supporting cells ( Fig . S1D , red ) , indicating that deletion and protein decline occurred rapidly . Together , these results indicate that JAG1 is ef ﬁ ciently deleted throughout the cochlea at early postnatal time points . Deletion of JAG1 in the maturing cochlea causes hearing loss To determine the effects of JAG1 deletion on auditory function , we measured auditory brainstem responses ( ABRs ) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions ( DPOAEs ) in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice and their littermate controls at 6 weeks of age ( Fig . 2 ) . Conditional deletion of Jag1 in maturing supporting cells ( Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ ) resulted in signi ﬁ cantly elevated ABR thresholds across the 8 – 32 kHz frequency range ( Fig . 2A , red ) . The threshold increases ranged from 30 to 50 dB , indicating compromised auditory function , but not complete deafness ( Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ ; Fig . 2A , red ) . Littermates , in which only one copy of Jag1 had been deleted ( Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 + / ﬂ ; Fig . 2A , blue ) were not signi ﬁ cantly different from Sox2 + / + littermate controls ( Sox2 + / + ; Fig . 2A , black ) , indicating that neither Cre expression , tamoxifen treatment , nor Jag1 heterozygosity impacted ABR thresholds . In contrast to the ABRs , DPOAE thresholds were not signi ﬁ cantly different between Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice and controls , indicating that cochlear ampli ﬁ cation is preserved in JAG1 - de ﬁ cient mice and outer hair cell function is intact ( Fig . 2B ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that neonatal loss of JAG1 primarily affects the function of the inner hair cell pathway , resulting in a speci ﬁ c type of hearing loss that is clinically similar to auditory neuropathy [ 24 ] . To further characterize the hearing loss that we observed in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice , we analyzed the ABR waveforms at 16 kHz in response to 75 dB SPL pure tone stimulus ( Fig . S2A ) and analyzed wave I amplitudes in response to pure tone stimuli of increasing sound pressure levels ( Fig . S2B ) . The average ABR waveforms of JAG1 - de ﬁ cient mice ( Fig . S2A , red ) were consider - ably different from controls ( Fig . S2A , black ) . In particular , Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice display a substantially decreased wave I response , which is generated by the signaling of inner hair cells to the auditory nerve [ 25 ] . Moreover , Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ cochleae do not display normal linear increases in wave I amplitudes in response increasing sound pressure levels ( Fig . S2B , red ) , further indicating dysfunctional inner hair cell signaling . These results indicated that JAG1 - de ﬁ cient cochleae had defects in the inner hair cell pathway , which could include synaptopathies or neuropathies . JAG1 - de ﬁ cient mice demonstrate normal spiral ganglion neuron quantities and ABR wave I absolute latencies Clinically , auditory neuropathies are a class of sensorineural hearing loss that are caused by pathology of the auditory nerve [ 24 ] . To determine whether spiral ganglion neuron loss con - tributed to the increased auditory thresholds observed in JAG1 - de ﬁ cient mice , we stained P6 Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ and Sox2 + / + littermate control cochlea for spiral ganglion neurons ( Fig . 3A , B ; Fig . 1 Deletion of the Notch ligand JAG1 in maturing supporting cells results in undetectable JAG1 immunostaining at 6 weeks .

Quanti ﬁ cation did not reveal any signi ﬁ cant differences between Sox2 + / + control ( Fig . 3C , black circles ) and Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice ( Fig . 3C , gray squares ) , indicating that neuronal loss is unlikely to be the cause of increased auditory thresholds . However , auditory neuropathy can also be caused by demyelination diseases [ 26 , 27 ] which cause slower nerve impulse conduction and demyelination of the auditory nerve would alter the peak latencies of the ABR waveform [ 28 , 29 ] . To determine the effect of JAG1 deletion on auditory nerve conductance , we plotted absolute latencies of wave I of the 16 kHz ABR waveform at 6 weeks [ 30 ] . ABR wave I absolute latencies in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice ( Fig . 3D , gray squares ) was not signi ﬁ cantly different from F . A . Gilels et al . 5 Cell Death and Disease ( 2022 ) 13 : 971 Sox2 + / + littermate controls ( Fig . 3D , black circles ) at 6 weeks of age , suggesting that neonatal JAG1 deletion does not alter auditory nerve myelination [ 28 , 29 ] . Inner hair cells are present and their synapses are largely unaffected in JAG1 - deleted cochleae Auditory synaptopathies are another class of sensorineural hearing loss and are caused by loss of inner hair cells or their synapses ( reviewed in [ 31 ] ) . To investigate if the elevated ABR thresholds ( Fig . 2A , red ) and decreased wave I amplitudes ( Fig . S2A , B , red ) of Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice were caused by a reduction in inner hair cells or their synapses , we stained whole mount cochleae for markers of hair cells ( ( MYO6 ) ( Fig . 4A , B , green ) or ( MYO7A ) ( Fig . 4G , H , red ) ) , presynaptic ribbons ( CTBP2 ) ( Fig . 4C , D , white ) and postsynaptic receptor patches ( GRIA2 ) ( Fig . 4E , F , green ) at 6 weeks of age . Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice ( Fig . 4I , gray squares ) had quantities of inner and outer hair cell that were comparable to Sox2 + / + littermate controls ( Fig . 4I , black circles ) , indicating that hair cell loss is not a consequence of JAG1 - deletion and is therefore not the cause of increased auditory thresholds . Furthermore , quanti ﬁ cation of Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ auditory synapses revealed only mild reductions in paired synapses at one frequency ( 16 kHz ) compared to Sox2 + / + littermate controls ( Fig . 4G , H , L ) . Given that it has been reported that mice can lose up to 50 % of their synapses without major effects on hearing thresholds [ 32 ] , these mild synaptic losses cannot account for the signi ﬁ cant threshold shifts observed in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice . Supporting cells show some alterations in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice Since JAG1 is localized to cochlear supporting cells , we wanted to examine the effects of Jag1 deletion on supporting cell develop - ment . Structurally , the organ of Corti appeared largely normal , complete with the tunnel of Corti , formed by the supporting pillar cells ( Fig . 5B ) . Previously , a group reported that deletion of JAG1 results in substantial loss of Hensen ’ s cells ( HeC ) , a supporting cell subtype located distally to the outer hair cells , without causing signi ﬁ cant effects on cochlear function [ 33 ] . Thus , we wanted to determine if the hearing loss in our JAG1 mutants was a consequence of alterations in other supporting cell subtypes , particularly those located adjacent to the inner hair cells . To this end , we performed immunohistochemistry on 6 - week - old sections stained with supporting cell - speci ﬁ c markers ( GLAST , S100a1 , SOX2 ) ( Fig . 5C – H , red ) and hair cell - speci ﬁ c markers ( MYO6 , MYO7A , PVALB ) ( Fig . 5I – N , green ) . Results showed that supporting cells markers were present , although in some cases ( S100a1 and SOX2 ) exhibited reduced expression in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ cochleae ( Fig . 5F , H , red ) . Additionally , Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice maintained expression of all three hair cell markers analyzed ( Fig . 5J , l , N , green ) . These results indicated that hair cells and the supporting cells immediately surrounding them are present in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice . To determine if we saw similar changes in the distal Hensen ’ s cell population as previously reported [ 33 ] , we performed immunohistochemistry at P6 using markers of hair cells and supporting cells ( Fig . S3 ) . Quanti ﬁ cation revealed Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice had substantial Hensen ’ s cell loss in all cochlear turns ( Fig . S3I , HeC , red squares ) . Taken together , these results suggest that JAG1 deletion in the maturing cochlea may affect some aspects of supporting cell development and / or maintenance . However , despite the reduction in some supporting cell marker expression and in Hensen ’ s cells , these alterations have not been reported to cause signi ﬁ cant hearing loss [ 33 ] . Moreover , the lack of effects on outer hair cell function ( measured by DPOAEs ) in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice despite the abnormalities in the outer supporting cell region also supports the idea that these alterations are unlikely to underlie the increased threshold shifts detected by ABR in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice . The Rho GTPase signaling pathway is dysregulated in JAG1 - deleted cochleae To provide additional insights into the role that JAG1 plays during cochlear maturation and to identify potential molecular differences , we performed RNA - seq on the cochlear sensory epithelium of P6 Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mutant and Sox2 + / + littermate control mice after tamoxifen administration at P0 / P1 . We found 548 differentially expressed genes with an adjusted p - value of < 0 . 05 , 411 of those genes were signi ﬁ cantly upregulated ( Fig . 6A , red ) while 137 were signi ﬁ cantly downregulated ( Fig . 6A , green ; datasets D1 and D2 ) . Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( IPA ; Qiagen ) revealed a number of different pathways that were signi ﬁ cantly altered by loss of JAG1 in the cochlea . Not surprisingly , Notch Signaling was the top pathway affected by loss of JAG1 ( Fig . 6A , B , blue ) . However , one of the top four pathways , signaling by Rho family GTPases , was of interest to us as this family is known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton [ 34 , 35 ] , an important component of hair cell structure , particularly the stereocilia . Notably , one of the genes in this pathway that was signi ﬁ cantly differentially overexpressed was Diaph3 , a member of the diaphanous - related formin ( DRF ) family involved in actin remodeling ( reviewed in [ 36 ] ) . Importantly , pathogenic variants in the Diaph3 gene in humans leads to DIAPH3 overexpression and causes autosomal dominant auditory neuropathy ( AUNA1 ) [ 37 ] , a speci ﬁ c form of hearing loss that resembles the type we observed in the Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mutants ( Fig . 2 ) . Moreover , mouse models of AUNA1 that have been generated by overexpressing Diaph3 show stereocilia fusion speci ﬁ cally affecting the inner hair cells [ 38 , 39 ] . Taken together , these similarities to AUNA1 indicated that potentially , actin dysregulation and stereocilia defects were under - lying the hearing loss in the Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mutant cochleae . Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ inner hair cells display dysmorphic stereocilia To examine whether JAG1 - de ﬁ ciency caused stereocilia defects in hair cells , we used scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) at 6 weeks of age to examine the ultrastructure of hair cell stereocilia . Dramatic malformations of the inner hair cell stereocilia were observed in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ cochleae ( Fig . 7B ) compared to Sox2 + / + littermate controls ( Fig . 7A ) . Speci ﬁ cally , we found that Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ inner hair cell stereocilia often appeared fused , such that individual stereocilia were not recognizable ( Fig . 7B , asterisks ) . This stereocilia fusion was observed in ~ 70 % of Fig . 4 Inner hair cells are present and their synapses are relatively unaffected in JAG1 - deleted cochleae at 6 weeks .

However , these defects were mostly prevalent in the apical / middle cochlear turns ( Fig . S4A – I ) and less frequently observed in the more basal regions ( Fig . S4J , K ) . In contrast , outer hair cell stereocilia appeared to have normal morphology throughout the cochlea ( Fig . 7B ) , indicating that these defects were speci ﬁ c to inner hair cells . Taken together , these results were consistent with results of the auditory testing ( Fig . 2 ) , which indicated that the inner hair cell pathway was disrupted in JAG1 - de ﬁ cient mice , and are consistent with AUNA1 mouse models that displayed fused stereocilia bundles , caused by overexpression of Diaph3 . DISCUSSION During embryonic inner ear development , the Notch ligand JAG1 plays an established role in prosensory region speci ﬁ cation F . A . Gilels et al . 7 Cell Death and Disease ( 2022 ) 13 : 971 through the process of lateral induction [ 2 , 7 – 10 ] . Although several of the Notch ligands are expressed in the cochlea , including DLL1 and JAG2 [ 11 , 14 , 40 ] , JAG1 is the only ligand expressed in supporting cells and maintained in the mature cochlea [ 16 ] . However , the function of JAG1 in the maturing cochlea is not well characterized . Here , we show that deletion of JAG1 in the cochlea results in hearing loss that resembles auditory neuropathy . Speci ﬁ cally , we show that ABR thresholds are signi ﬁ cantly increased while DPOAEs , which assess outer hair cell function , are normal in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice . These results indicate that the inner hair cell pathway is primarily affected in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice . Analysis of the cellular makeup of the organ of Corti shows that hair cells and supporting cells are largely present , as well as auditory neurons in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice . Moreover , inner hair cell synapses are also largely unaffected in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice . Molecular analysis at P6 using RNA - seq indicated that the Rho GTPase signaling pathway , including Diaph3 , is signi ﬁ cantly altered in JAG1 - de ﬁ cient cochlea . Previous studies have shown that Diaph3 overexpression causes auditory neuropathy in humans ( AUNA1 ) , and mouse models revealed inner hair cell stereocilia defects . When analyzed by SEM , JAG1 - de ﬁ cient cochleae display similar defects in the inner hair cell stereocilia . Taken together , our data show that deletion of JAG1 during cochlear maturation results in hearing loss caused by inner hair cell stereocilia defects , resembling AUNA1 mouse models . In the cochlea , Notch signaling plays a well - established role in mediating lateral inhibition , which determines whether a cochlear precursor will adopt a hair cell or supporting cell fate . Disruptions in lateral inhibition during embryogenesis result in an over - production of hair cells at the expense of supporting cells [ 11 – 13 ] . Additionally , disruptions in Notch signaling during the early postnatal period can also result in excess hair cells [ 41 – 44 ] . However , we did not observe excess hair cell production after JAG1 deletion , indicating that JAG1 signaling does not participate in lateral inhibition during cochlear maturation . Another role that Notch can play is an instructive role during differentiation . This role is less well understood but has been demonstrated in the central nervous system , where Notch has been shown to promote the differentiation of glia [ 45 – 51 ] . Given that supporting cells share some similarities with glia ( reviewed in [ 52 ] ) , it is possible that JAG1 plays an instructive role in supporting cell differentia - tion . In support of an instructive role , we have previously shown that ectopically activating Notch in early - developing hair cells can convert them to a supporting cell - like fate [ 19 ] . Similarly , other groups have shown that overactivation of Notch promotes supporting cell - speci ﬁ c gene expression and Deiters ’ cell loss [ 22 ] . Most recently , Chrysostomou et al . , ( 2020 ) showed that deleting JAG1 in the early developing cochlea ( Sox2 CreERT2 / + : : Jag1 fx / fx or Fgfr3 - iCreER T2 : : Jag1 fx / fx ) results in loss of Hensen ’ s cells , a distal supporting cell population that ﬂ anks the third row of outer hair cells [ 33 ] . We also observed a loss of Hensen ’ s cells after JAG1 deletion ( Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ ) at P0 / P1 . However , Chrysosto - mou showed that despite lacking most Hensen ’ s cells , there was little effect on hearing thresholds using a Cre allele that only deleted JAG1 in the outer supporting cells ( Fgfr3 - iCreER T2 : : Jag1 fx / fx ) [ 33 ] . Thus , these results indicate that the presence of Hensen ’ s cells is not critical for maintaining hearing thresholds . We show here that JAG1 deletion throughout the supporting cell popula - tion ( Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ ) results in signi ﬁ cant increases in ABR thresholds . Even more , interestingly , there were no effects on Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ DPOAEs , an assessment of outer hair cell function . These results indicate that JAG1 plays another role in the cochlea outside of regulating Hensen ’ s cell numbers , which speci ﬁ cally affects inner hair cell function . Clinically , patients with hearing loss that present with increased ABR thresholds and normal DPOAEs would be classi ﬁ ed as having auditory neuropathy , indicating inner hair cell function is compromised , while outer hair cell function is maintained . In mice , hearing loss is commonly classi ﬁ ed as either a synaptopathy ( caused by loss of inner hair cell synapses ) , a neuropathy ( caused by loss of spiral ganglion neurons / dysfunction of the auditory nerve ) , an ampli ﬁ er defect ( caused by loss of outer hair cells ) or a Fig . 5 The overall structure of the organ of Corti appeared normal at 6 weeks , although some reduction in supporting cell markers was detected .

Gilels et al . 8 Cell Death and Disease ( 2022 ) 13 : 971 global dysfunction ( caused by improper homeostatic / ionic balance ) ( reviewed in [ 53 ] ) . Our physiological and histological analysis indicate that JAG1 - de ﬁ cient cochleae have normal inner hair cell numbers , relatively normal inner hair cell synapses , and normal numbers of auditory neurons , ruling out these as reasons for the increased auditory thresholds . Instead , our molecular results using RNA - seq analysis indicate that the Rho GTPase signaling pathway is disrupted in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice , a pathway commonly involved in actin dynamics . Since the stereocilia are composed mainly of actin , and stereocilia defects are one of the most common causes of deafness [ 54 ] , we used SEM to demonstrate that the inner hair cell stereocilia were abnormal in Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice , often showing fused and elongated stereocilia . The fact that only the inner hair cell stereocilia are abnormal is consistent with physiological results in JAG1 - de ﬁ cient mice showing raised ABR thresholds while main - taining normal DPOAEs , indicating normal outer hair cell function . Importantly , we are deleting JAG1 at P0 / P1 which is an early stage of stereocilia development when the stereocilia are not fully organized or mature . Studies have shown that in rodents , postnatal stages are a critical time for stereocilia morphogenesis , including elongation , signi ﬁ cant microvilli reabsorption , and staircase re ﬁ nement [ 55 ] . Additionally , the kinocilia of mouse auditory hair cells , an important mediator of hair cell morphogen - esis and planar cell polarity ( PCP ) , continually degenerates until its absence at the onset of hearing ( postnatal day ( P ) 12 ) ( reviewed in [ 56 ] ) . Previously it has been shown that members of the Rho GTPase family play an essential role in cochlear hair cell stereocilia formation and maintenance . Speci ﬁ cally , loss or dysregulation of the Rho GTPases RAC1 [ 57 ] , CDC42 [ 58 , 59 ] , their activator ARHGEF6 [ 60 ] , or their downstream effector PAK1 [ 61 ] leads to de ﬁ cits in cochlear stereocilia development or maintenance . Interestingly , others have shown PCP dysregulation in hair bundles after Cdc42 deletion in both hair cells and supporting cells , but this was not observed after hair cell - only Cdc42 deletion [ 58 , 62 ] . Furthermore , recent results from Du et al . ( 2021 ) demonstrate that CDC42 acts in both a cell - autonomous and non - autonomous manner during stereocilia development [ 59 ] . Speci ﬁ cally , a more severe stereocilia phenotype with additional planar cell polarity ( PCP ) defects were observed after treatment with a CDC42 inhibitor compared to the stereocilia phenotype observed after hair cell - speci ﬁ c Cdc42 inactivation , indicating involvement of other cells like supporting cells , in Cdc42 - mediated PCP regulation [ 59 ] . These studies indicate that cochlear support - ing cells likely play a role in hair cell stereocilia formation and maintenance . We also identi ﬁ ed a gene of interest , Diaph3 , within the signaling by Rho family GTPase pathway that was signi ﬁ cantly upregulated in JAG1 - de ﬁ cient cochleae . Diaph1 - 3 are members of the mammalian diaphanous - related formin ( DRF ) family that are activated by Rho GTPases , and are involved in actin remodeling [ 63 – 65 ] . Importantly , pathogenic variants in DIAPH1 and DIAPH3 have been shown to cause deafness . Previously , studies in humans [ 66 – 69 ] and mice [ 70 , 71 ] have identi ﬁ ed that pathogenic variants in DIAPH1 cause DFNA1 , a form of non - syndromic autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss . These pathogenic variants are thought to interfere with the autoregulation of DIAPH1 , resulting in a constitutively active protein [ 65 , 66 ] . Similarly , work conducted in both humans and mice has also established a link between Diaph3 levels and hearing loss . In humans , heterozygous mutation in the DIAPH3 gene cause autosomal dominant auditory neuropathy 1 ( AUNA1 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , a point mutation in the 5 ’ untranslated region of the DIAPH3 human gene leads to overexpression of the DIAPH3 protein [ 37 ] . Mouse models of AUNA1 , in which Diaph3 is overexpressed , exhibit auditory neuropathy hearing loss [ 38 , 39 ] . Strikingly , mouse models of Diaph3 overexpression show abnormal inner hair cell stereocilia morphology [ 38 ] , similar to the morphology of JAG1 - de ﬁ cient inner hair cells . Taken together , these studies indicate that overexpression of Diaph3 is deleterious for hearing . Currently , the identity and cellular location of the Notch receptor ( s ) mediating the effects of JAG1 in the maturing cochlea Fig . 7 Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ inner hair cells display stereocilia malformations . A – D Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) of the sensory regions of 6 - week - old Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ and Sox2 + / + littermate cochleae . The majority of Sox2 CreER / + Jag1 ﬂ / ﬂ inner hair cells ( B ; asterisks ) display signi ﬁ cant stereocilia fusion compared to Sox2 + / + littermate controls ( A ) , although there are some hair cells with unfused stereocilia ( D ; arrowhead ) . However , outer hair cell stereocilia of the mutant mice appear to have normal morphology . Scale bar : 10 µm .

Gilels et al . 9 Cell Death and Disease ( 2022 ) 13 : 971 are unknown . However , out of the four Notch receptors ( NOTCH1 - 4 ) , three have reported expression in the organ of Corti ( Notch1 - 3 ) [ 15 , 40 ] . Previous studies have shown that NOTCH1 plays a role in mediating lateral inhibition postnatally , and in preventing continued proliferation [ 72 , 73 ] . NOTCH2 is also a possible receptor given that it acts as the receptor for JAG1 in other systems that are affected in Alagille syndrome [ 74 ] . Thus , NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 are possible receptors based on established roles in the cochlea or other systems , but NOTCH1 , NOTCH2 , NOTCH3 , or a combination of these receptors , could mediate the effects of JAG1 in the maturing cochlea . Our results uncover a novel role for JAG1 in the maturing cochlea in maintaining the inner hair cell stereocilia . Given that JAG1 is expressed in supporting cells and likely receptors are also in supporting cells [ 15 , 40 , 75 ] , these results highlight a potential interaction between hair cell and supporting cells that is required to maintain the stereocilia . Future studies will reveal how the Notch pathway interacts with the Rho GTPase signaling pathway to regulate stereocilia maintenance .
