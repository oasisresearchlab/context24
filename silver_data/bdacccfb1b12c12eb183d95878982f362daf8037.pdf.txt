Ginestra Bianconi and Andrea Capocci Institut the Physique Th´eorique , Universit´e de Fribourg P´erolles , CH - 1700 , Switzerland The hierarchical structure of scale - free networks has been investigated focusing on the scaling of the number N h ( t ) of loops of size h as a function of the system size . In particular we have found the analytic expression for the scaling of N h ( t ) in the Barab´asi - Albert scale - free network . We have performed numerical simulations on the scaling law for N h ( t ) in the BA network and in other growing scale free networks , such as the bosonic network and the aging nodes network . We show that in the bosonic network and in the aging node network the phase transitions in the topology of the network are accompained by a change in the scaling of the number of loops with the system size .

Fb Natural and social systems ranging from protein - protein interactions [ 1 ] to the World Wide Web [ 2 ] can be represented as scale - free ( SF ) networks [ 3 – 6 ] , that is , as a set of nodes connected by links with special statisti - cal properties . These systems are characterized by large ﬂuctuations in the individual degrees , i . e . in the number of links pointing or leaving each node . In a SF network , the statistical distribution P ( k ) of the degree k is a power law P ( k ) ∼ k − γ . Accordingly , if γ < 3 , the individual degree distribution displays inﬁnite variance in the limit of inﬁnite network size . Besides this striking property , models traditionally de - ﬁned on regular lattices display peculiar eﬀects when de - ﬁned on a scale - free topology instead [ 7 – 12 ] . Such phe - nomena have increased the interest in ﬁnding universal mechanisms to generate SF networks , which seem to arise independently in so diverse contexts . Recently , these properties have been reproduced by the Barab´asi - Albert ( BA ) dynamical model of a random net - work . Its simple and natural algorithm , based on a “pref - erential attachment” rule [ 2 , 13 ] , triggered an avalanche of research activity in the ﬁeld and generated a rich “zo - ology” of SF network models sharing the same fundamen - tal ingredients . Though recently alternative mechanisms [ 14 , 15 ] for the generation of scale - free network have been proposed , in this work we restrict our attention to grow - ing scale - free networks with “preferential attachment” . But the degree distribution is not the only relevant topo - logical quantity . For the characterization of networks it is necessary to look at the motifs [ 16 – 18 ] recurrent on it and in particular at the number of loops of length larger then three [ 19 ] . In this work we derive a general formula for the number of loops of size h that generalizes the known result concerning triangular loops [ 20 ] ( h = 3 ) for a BA network . In particular , we ﬁnd that the number of loops N h ( t ) of size h at time t in a BA network scales as N h ( t ) ∼ ( m / 2 log ( t ) ) ψ . In addition , we show that our for - mula is robust when tested on other growing SF network models , such as the bosonic network model ( BN ) [ 21 ] and the aging nodes model ( AN ) [ 22 ] . In the bosonic net - work the scaling of the number of loops with the system size changes below the Bose - Einstein phase transition be - coming a power - law scaling of the type N h ( t ) ∼ t ξ . The BA model [ 2 , 13 ] was the ﬁrst and simplest algo - rithm generating scale - free undirected networks . In this model , a new node is added to the network at each time step , and it is connected by a ﬁxed number of links m to highly connected existing nodes ( preferential attach - ment ) . According to this rule , the probability Π i that an existing node i at time t acquires a new link is assumed to be proportional to its degree k i ( t ) . This reads Π i = m k i ( t ) P j k j ( t ) . ( 1 ) The model can be analyzed by a mean ﬁeld approxima - tion [ 2 ] . By this approach , one ﬁnds that the average degree of a node i that entered the network at time t i increases with time as a power - law k i ( t ) = m 2 r t t i . ( 2 ) A network built in this way displays a power law degree distribution P ( k ) ∼ k − 3 . In order to investigate the in - homogeneous topology of the network , we deﬁne a loop of size h ( a h - loop ) as a closed path of h links that visits each intermediate node only once . In the case m > 2 , the BA scale - free network is a very compact network , with loops of any size . As the network evolves , new loops are introduced in the network . By def - inition , new loops include the newly added node : indeed , a new h - loop is formed if the new node is connected to two nodes already connected by a self - avoiding path of size h − 2 . We indicate with p i , k the probability that the nodes i , k , attached to the network at time t i , t k , are con - nected by a link . The rate at which new loops of length h are formed is given by the probability that the new node k is linked to two existing nodes i and j times the probability P h − 2 i , j ( t ) that they are already connected by a self - avoiding path of size h − 2 . Therefore , we write the following rate equation for the average number of h - loops N h ( t ) ∂ < N h ( t ) > ∂t = 1 2 N X i = 1 N X j = 1 p i , k p j , k P h − 2 ij ( t ) , ( 3 ) 1 where the factor 12 takes into account that each pair of nodes i , j has been counted twice in the sums . On the other hand , two nodes belong to a h - loop if there is a link between them and , besides it , they are connected by a self - avoiding path of length h − 1 . Let P h − 1 i , j ( t ) be the probability that this path exists ; thus , the probability that the link between node i and j be - longs to a h - loop is given by p i , j P h − 1 i , j ( t ) . We obtain the average number < N h ( t ) > of h - loops in the system times 2 h by summing this quantity over all the nodes i , j in the network . In fact , each loop has been counted 2 h times , because there are h nodes in the loop , and two possible directions . Hence , we can write < N h ( t ) > = 1 2 h N X i = 1 N X j = 1 p i , j P h − 1 ij ( t ) . ( 4 ) By replacing Eq . ( 2 ) in Eq . ( 1 ) , the probability that the node i is attached to node k is p i , k = m 2 1 √ t i t k . ( 5 ) Moreover , the probability that a node k is connected with nodes i and j is proportional to the probability that i and j are already connected , i . e . p i , k p j , k = m 1 2 t k p i , j . ( 6 ) By replacing this result in ( 3 ) and by the deﬁnition ( 4 ) , we obtain ∂ < N h ( t ) > ∂t = m 2 t ( h − 1 ) < N h − 1 ( t ) > . ( 7 ) Consequently , the rate at which new loops of size h are in - troduced in the system is proportional to the mean num - ber of loops of size h − 1 . Equation ( 7 ) has a recursive structure that allows its integration without any detailed information about the probabilities P h i , j ( t ) . In fact , the rate at which new loops of length h are formed can be expressed only in terms of the number of loops of minimal size ( i . e . h = 3 ) , ∂ h − 3 < N h ( ζ ) > ∂ζ h − 3 = ( h − 1 ) ! < N 3 ( ζ ) > ( 8 ) with ζ = m 2 log ( t ) . The number of triangular loops < N 3 ( ζ ) > can be computed directly , for the triangu - lar loops increase in time following ( 3 ) , ∂ < N 3 ( t ) > ∂t = 1 2 N X i = 1 N X j = 1 p i , k p j , k p i , j . ( 9 ) Since p i , j is given by eq . ( 5 ) , approximating sums by integrals we write the rate equation in the form ∂ < N 3 ( t ) > ∂t = 1 2 (cid:16) m 2 (cid:17) 3 Z t 0 dt i Z t 0 dt j 1 t i 1 t j 1 t = 1 2 (cid:16) m 2 (cid:17) 3 1 t [ log ( t ) ] 2 . ( 10 ) Integrating ( 10 ) we ﬁnd , in agreement with [ 20 ] , < N 3 ( t ) > = 1 3 ! h m 2 log ( t ) i 3 .

The Inset shows the values of the measured exponent ψ deﬁned in ( 16 ) for h = 3 , 4 , 5 . Using eq . ( 11 ) in eq . ( 8 ) , we compute the number of loops of size h , < N h ( t ) > and we ﬁnd < N h ( t ) > = h m 2 log ( t ) i h ( 1 + O ( ζ − 1 ) ) . ∼ h m 2 log ( t ) i h . ( 12 ) The expression for the scaling of N h ( t ) with the sys - tem size t in a BA network does not suggest a practi - cal way to measure N h ( t ) . To this purpose , one has to study the symmetrical adjacency matrix a of the net - work , whose generic element a ij is deﬁned by a ij = 1 if i and j are connected and a ij = 0 otherwise . Knowing this matrix , one directly measures the number of paths start - ing from a node i and returning on it after h steps that visit intermediate nodes only once . According to this ar - gument , the term N h ( t ) has a dominating term of the type P i ( a h ) i , i / ( 2 h ) and subdominant terms excluding all trivial contributions coming from paths intersecting on themselves . Let us assume that the network does not contain self - loops , i . e . a ii = 0 for all i of the network . In this case , for h = 3 we simply have N 3 = 1 6 X i ( a 3 ) ii . ( 13 ) For h = 4 and h = 5 , by simple arguments it is possible to show that N 4 = 1 8 " X i ( a 4 ) ii − 2 X i ( a 2 ) ii ( a 2 ) ii + X i ( a 2 ) ii # ( 14 ) 2 and that N 5 = 1 10 " X i ( a 5 ) ii − 5 X i ( a 2 ) ii ( a 3 ) ii + 5 X i ( a 3 ) ii # . ( 15 ) Using relations ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) , we can directly measure N h ( t ) for h = 3 , 4 , 5 in the BA scale - free network model to check our analytical results . In Fig . 1 we show that the scaling of N h ( t ) for a BA network with m = 2 follows N h ( t ) ∼ (cid:16) m 2 log ( t ) (cid:17) ψ ( h ) . ( 16 ) The measured eﬀective exponent ψ ( h ) reported in the Inset of Fig . 1 grows with h as expected . Neverthe - less , ψ ( h ) diﬀers from the predicted asymptotic behavior ψ ( h ) = h in a signiﬁcant way . This can be explained by the fact that we are considering networks of size up to t = 10 4 nodes and we are still far form the asymptotic behavior t → ∞ . To check the robustness of the scaling relations of N h ( t ) , we have measured the number of loops of size h = 3 , 4 , 5 in two alternative growing SF network mod - els : the bosonic network ( BN ) [ 21 ] and the aging nodes network ( AN ) [ 22 ] . In the BN bosonic network , each node i is assigned an innate quality , represented by a random ’energy’ ǫ i drawn form the probability distribution p ( ǫ i ) . The at - tractiveness of each node i is then determined jointly by its connectivity k i and its energy ǫ i . In particular , the probability that node i acquires a link at time t is given by Π i = e − βǫ i k i ( t ) P j e − βǫ j k j ( t ) , ( 17 ) i . e . low energy , high degree nodes are more likely to ac - quire new links . The parameter β = 1 / T in Π i tunes the relevance of the quality with respect to the degree in the acquisition probability of new links . Indeed , for T → ∞ the probability Π i does not depend any more on the energy ǫ i and the BN model reduces to the BA model . On the other hand , in the limit T → 0 only the lowest energy node has non zero probability to acquire new links . Moreover , in Ref . [ 21 ] it has been shown that the connectivity distribution in this network model can be mapped on the occupation number in a Bose gas . Ac - cording to this analogy , one would expect a corresponding phase transition in the topology of the network at some temperature value T c . In fact , for energy distributions such that ( p ( ǫ ) → 0 for ǫ → 0 ) , one observes a critical temperature T c . For T > T c the system is in the “ﬁt - get - rich” ( FGR ) phase , where nodes with lower energy acquire links at a higher rate that higher energy nodes , while for T < T c a “Bose - Einstein condensate” ( BE ) or “winner - takes - all” phase emerges , where a single nodes grabs a ﬁnite fraction of all the links . We simulated this model assuming p ( ǫ ) = ( θ + 1 ) ǫ θ and ǫ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) ( 18 ) where θ = 1 . For this distribution , it has been shown that T c ( θ = 1 ) = 0 . 7 [ 21 ] . In particular , in Fig . 2 we report N h ( t ) for h = 3 , 4 , 5 as a function of the number of nodes t in the network , at temperature T = 1 . 5 and T = 0 . 5 respectively . According to simulations , in correspondence with the phase transition , the scaling of N h ( t ) drastically switches from a BA - like behavior N h ( t ) ∝ (cid:16) m 2 log ( t ) (cid:17) ψ ( h ) for T > T c ( 19 ) to a power - law scaling N h ( t ) ∝ t ξ ( h ) for T < T c .

Scaling of the number of loops N h ( t ) of size h with the system size t in the FGR and in the BE phase of a bosonic network . The plotted data have been obtained for a network with p ( ǫ ) = 2 ǫ and ǫ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) ( which has T c = 0 . 7 [ 19 ] ) at T = 1 . 5 ( FGR phase ) and at T = 0 . 5 ( BE phase ) . In the Insets we report the value of the exponents ψ ( 2 . 6 , 3 . 9 , 5 . 2 ) and ξ ( 0 . 78 , 1 . 28 , 156 ) found in the simulations for h = 3 , 4 , 5 respectively . We have measured the scaling of N h ( t ) with the sys - tem size t also for a growing network with aging nodes ( AN ) introduced in [ 22 ] . The model has been motivated by the observation that in many real networks , e . g . the scientiﬁc citations network , old nodes are less cited than recent ones . In the goal of representing this feature , the probability Π i to attach a link to a node i arrived in the network at time t i is modiﬁed to be Π i = ( t − t i ) − α k i ( t ) P j ( t − t j ) − α k j ( t ) . ( 21 ) where α is an external parameter . As in the BA model , a new node is connected to m existing nodes . The re - sulting structure of such a network strongly depends on the constant α . For α < 1 , the degree distribution is a power law P ( k ) ∼ k − γ with an exponent monotonically 3 increasing from γ = 2 in the limit α → −∞ to γ → ∞ in the limit α → 1 : on the other hand , for α > 1 no power law is observed in the degree distribution . Therefore , this model reproduces a SF network only in the region α > 1 . Moreover , as observed in [ 22 ] , in the limit α → −∞ the oldest node is connected to an increasing fraction of all the links , reminding the condensation observed in a bosonic network . To take into account this phenomenon , we introduce a value α ∗ such that for α < α ∗ the fraction of links attached to the most connected node exceeds a ﬁnite threshold F . We expect the scaling of N h ( t ) to be diﬀerent in the three regions α > 1 , α ∈ ( α ∗ , 1 ) and α < α ∗ . −6 −4 −2 0 2 4 6 α 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 10 1 k m ax / m t t = 10 4 10 0 10 2 10 4 t 10 0 10 3 10 6 N h ( t ) 10 −1 10 0 10 1 mlog ( t ) / 2 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 N h ( t ) 0 5e + 03 1e + 04 t 0 2e + 03 4e + 03 N h ( t ) ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) FIG . 3 . The order parameter k max / mt for a network with aging of the nodes , size t = 10 4 and m = 2 . We distinguish between three region of the phase space : α > 1 , α ∈ ( − 1 , 1 ) and α < − 1 . In the Insets we report the typical behavior of N h ( t ) as a function of t for h = 3 , 4 , 5 in the three regions . We measured the total fraction of links k max / mt at - tached to the oldest node in a network with m = 2 and t = 10 4 nodes . The threshold has been ﬁxed at F = 0 . 1 , in order to distinguish the ’condensate’ phase from the simple scale - free phase . The value for α ∗ was found to be α ∗ = − 1 . We then measured the number of loops of size h = 3 , 4 , 5 for networks made of up to 10 4 nodes in the three ranges of value of α . We have observed that , for α > 1 , the number of loops of size h scales linearly with t ( at least for h = 3 , 4 , 5 ) . In the Inset ( a ) of Fig . 3 we report the data for α = 1 . 5 . On the contrary , for α ∈ ( − α ∗ , 1 ) we measured the scaling N h ( t ) ∝ (cid:16) m 2 log ( t ) (cid:17) ψ ( h ) ( 22 ) with ψ ( h ) a monotonic function of h . In Inset ( b ) of Fig . 3 , data for α = 0 . 5 are reported . Finally , in the region α < α ∗ = − 1 , N h ( t ) becomes proportional to a power - law of the system size , as it is shown in Inset ( c ) of Fig . 3 , referring to the case α = − 5 . In conclusion , we have introduced the number of h - loops N h ( t ) for a network of t nodes as a characterizing quantity for random networks . We have observed that in the BA scale - free networks N h ( t ) scales as a power law of the logarithm of the system size . Moreover , we have observed that indeed this scaling seems to be a marking feature of growing scale - free networks with preferential attachment . In particular , topological phase transitions in the bosonic network and in network including aging nodes are accompanied by a drastic change in the scaling of N h ( t ) with the system size .
