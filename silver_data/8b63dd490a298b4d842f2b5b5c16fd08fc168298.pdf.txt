Petsko , Weill Cornell Medical College , New York , NY , and approved July 25 , 2016 ( received for review December 10 , 2015 ) Membrane remodeling by Fes / Cip4 homology - Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs167 ( F - BAR ) proteins is regulated by autoinhibitory interactions between their SRC homology 3 ( SH3 ) and F - BAR domains . The structural basis of autoregulation , and whether it affects interac - tions of SH3 domains with other cellular ligands , remain unclear . Here we used single - particle electron microscopy to determine the structure of the F - BAR protein Nervous Wreck ( Nwk ) in both soluble and membrane - bound states . On membrane binding , Nwk SH3 domains do not completely dissociate from the F - BAR dimer , but instead shift from its concave surface to positions on either side of the dimer . Unexpectedly , along with controlling membrane binding , these autoregulatory interactions inhibit the ability of Nwk - SH3a to activate Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASp ) / actin related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 - dependent actin filament assembly . In Drosophila neurons , Nwk autoregulation restricts SH3a domain - dependent synaptopod formation , synaptic growth , and actin or - ganization . Our results define structural rearrangements in Nwk that control F - BAR – membrane interactions as well as SH3 domain activities , and suggest that these two functions are tightly coordi - nated in vitro and in vivo . F - BAR | actin | Drosophila | Nwk | WASp E ukaryotic membranes are shaped and remodeled by a host of lipid - binding proteins that must be highly regulated to enable the rapid dynamics of cell morphogenesis and intracellular traffic . Members of the Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs167 ( BAR ) family of pro - teins dimerize to form a crescent - shaped membrane - interacting scaffold that can stabilize or generate membrane curvature ( 1 ) . It remains poorly understood how these scaffolds are targeted to specific membranes in vivo , and how their activities are regulated to direct membrane dynamics in diverse contexts . Many BAR family members contain C - terminal SRC homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains that interact with proline - rich ligands , including dynamin , a large GTPase that promotes membrane scission , and Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASp ) , which promotes actin filament assembly via the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex ( 2 – 5 ) . WASp itself is autoregulated by inhibitory interactions between its N terminus and its C - terminal Arp2 / 3 - activating verprolin - central - acidic ( VCA ) domain , and can be activated by the combined effects of SH3 domain - containing binding partners , charged phospholipids , Rho family GTPases , and induced multi - merization ( 6 ) . For several BAR family members , including Syn - dapin , Amphiphysin , and Nervous Wreck ( Nwk ) , C - terminal SH3 domains also bind directly to the BAR domain , inhibiting mem - brane association ( 7 – 16 ) . Mounting evidence suggests that ligands of the BAR and / or SH3 domains may release this autoinhibition , providing regulatory inputs into membrane remodeling in vivo ( 8 , 9 , 12 ) ; however , little is known about the structural basis of autoinhibition in BAR domain proteins , or its effect on their interactions with binding partners . This raises the possibility that autoinhibition in solution affects the activities of SH3 domains on ligands such as WASp and dynamin . Furthermore , once the BAR domain is bound to the membrane , it is unclear whether the adjacent SH3 domains func - tion independently or instead remain influenced by their proximity to the BAR domain . Drosophila Nervous Wreck is a neuronal F - BAR ( Fes / Cip4 - homology - BAR ) domain protein with two C - terminal SH3 do - mains ( Fig . 1 A ) . The Nwk F - BAR domain forms a dimer that assembles into higher - order zigzag arrays on negatively charged membranes and promotes the formation of membrane ridges and scallops ( 17 ) . Nwk is required at the Drosophila larval neu - romuscular junction ( NMJ ) to constrain the traffic and signaling activity of growth factor receptors ( 18 – 20 ) . Mammalian genomes encode two Nwk family members , FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 , which are associated with stereocilia and the trafficking of neuro - transmitter receptors ( 21 , 22 ) . Nwk interacts with WASp and dynamin via its SH3a domain ( 19 , 20 ) , and cooperates with Cdc42 to activate WASp / Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization ( 20 ) . We previously showed that both SH3 domains of Nwk bind directly to the Nwk F - BAR domain in solution via elec - trostatic interactions , shifting the lipid charge requirements for Nwk - induced membrane deformation ( 16 ) . Here we describe the Significance Membrane - deforming proteins cooperate with the cytoskeleton to sculpt lipid bilayers into complex and dynamic geometries , but we still do not understand how their activities are temporally and spatially regulated in cells . Here we show that the neuronal membrane remodeling protein Nervous Wreck ( Nwk ) is auto - inhibited by intramolecular interactions between its membrane binding F - BAR domain and its C - terminal SRC homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains . These autoinhibitory interactions control Fes / Cip4 homology - Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs167 ( F - BAR ) – mediated membrane remodeling and also , unexpectedly , inhibit SH3 - mediated actin cytoskeleton assembly . Uncoupling these dual autoregulatory mechanisms in the fruit fly leads to excess neuronal synapse growth . Thus , coordinated autoregulation couples membrane remodeling and SH3 domain activities , and is critical for proper control of neuronal shape and size . Author contributions : T . B .

Results Structure of Non – Membrane - Bound Nwk . To address how autor - egulatory interactions affect F - BAR protein activity and function , we used negative - stain electron microscopy ( EM ) and single - particle analysis to determine the structure of Nwk ( purified pro - teins shown in Fig . S1 A – D ) . Nwk 1 – 731 is an autoinhibited Nwk construct that includes all of its major domains ( Fig . 1 A ) and rescues function in vivo ( 16 , 23 ) . We first analyzed Nwk 1 – 731 in the absence of membranes , on carbon - coated grids ( Fig . S2 A – D ) . Single - particle class averages exhibited symmetry ( Fig . S3 A ) , and particles were randomly oriented on the grid ( Fig . S3 B ) , allowing us to use the angular reconstitution method ( 24 ) to generate a 3D reconstruction ( Fig . 1 B and Fig . S3 C and D ) . For this re - construction , we excluded class averages ( 16 % of total particles ) that were similar to those of the F - BAR domain alone . These are likely to represent the fraction in equilibrium of “ open ” Nwk 1 – 731 , in which the F - BAR is available for membrane binding ( 16 , 17 ) and SH3 domain positions are not constrained ( and thus are not de - fined in class averages ) . Compared with the isolated F - BAR domain ( Nwk 1 – 428 ) , which forms an S - shaped dimer ( 17 ) , our Nwk 1 – 731 3D reconstruction exhibited an overall arrangement consistent with an F - BAR domain - shaped mass with additional masses positioned below its concave surface ( Fig . 1 B ) . To determine the positions of the C - terminal SH3 domains within this reconstruction , we used an unbiased approach to identify side - lying Nwk 1 – 731 and Nwk 1 – 428 class averages ( Mate - rials and Methods ) . When we compared these class averages with each other , the additional mass in Nwk 1 – 731 was present adjacent to the concave surface of the F - BAR ( Fig . 1 C ) . These data in - dicate that in autoinhibited Nwk , the F - BAR concave surface is largely blocked by the C - terminal SH3 domains ( model , Fig . 1 D ) . Structure of Membrane - Bound Nwk . We next used negative - stain EM and single - particle analysis to examine the structure and higher - order organization of Nwk on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing mem - brane monolayers ( Fig . S4 A – D ) . We first determined the orien - tation of 2D class averages for Nwk 1 – 731 dimers on carbon film vs . membrane monolayers ( Fig . S5 A , Table S1 , and Materials and Methods ) . Compared with membrane - free Nwk , membrane monolayer - associated Nwk 1 – 731 was biased toward orientations in which the concave surface faced the membrane , consistent with a conventional F - BAR – membrane association ( 25 ) . We next ex - amined the higher - order organization of Nwk 1 – 731 on membrane monolayers . Nwk 1 – 731 oligomerized in V - shape dimer pairs and zigzags ( Fig . S5 B and C ) , similar to the arrangements of Nwk 1 – 428 alone ( 17 ) . Therefore , Nwk 1 - 731 associates with membranes in a similar fashion to Nwk 1 – 428 , consistent with their similar membrane remodeling activities ( 16 , 17 ) . Because the Nwk 1 – 731 single - particle class averages exhibited symmetry ( Fig . S6 A ) and particles showed a preferred orientation on the membrane ( Fig . S6 B ) , we were able to produce a 3D recon - struction using the random conical tilt method ( Fig . 2 A and Fig . S6 C and D ) . For this reconstruction , we used 80 . 7 % of the total particles , representing the concave - down or side - down orientations ( see above ) that we previously showed to be favored for higher - order assembly and for membrane binding ( 16 , 17 ) . In contrast to the S - shape of Nwk 1 – 428 on membranes ( 17 ) and the vertical arrange - ment of the F - BAR domain above the SH3 domains for Nwk 1 – 731 on carbon film ( Fig . 1 B and D ) , the membrane - bound Nwk 1 – 731 dimers displayed a flattened dumbbell shape ( Fig . 2 A and Fig . S6 D ) . Compared with the predicted structure of Nwk 1 – 313 filtered to 20 Å ( Fig . 2 B , pink ) ( 17 ) , the reconstruction revealed a mass on the inner surface of the curve of the S - shaped dimer ( Fig . 2 B , red ar - rows ) , along with a mass on the outside surface of the curve ( Fig . 2 B , blue arrows ) , as well as an additional mass near the center of the F - BAR domain ( Fig . 2 B , green arrows ) . Interestingly , these masses did not occlude the F - BAR tips , consistent with our results showing that the tips are required for efficient membrane binding ( 17 ) . To determine which of the additional masses represents each Nwk SH3 domain , we analyzed monolayer - bound single - particle averages of truncated Nwk proteins lacking one or both SH3 domains ( Fig . 2 C and D ) . Subtracting the Nwk 1 – 428 concave side - down class average from the Nwk 1 – 633 class averages ( lacking SH3b ) revealed a mass on the inner curve of the S - shaped F - BAR ( Fig . 2 D ) . In contrast , subtracting Nwk 1 – 633 class averages from Nwk 1 – 731 class averages revealed a mass on the outer curve of the S - shaped F - BAR ( Fig . 2 C ) . Thus , we conclude that the small mass on the inner curve is SH3a , and the mass on the outer curve is SH3b ( models , Fig . 2 C and D ) . Importantly , our 3D model indicated that on average , the SH3 domains were not disordered in the membrane - bound structure , but instead were associated with the F - BAR do - main at specific positions .

We next sought to identify the additional mass that appears in membrane - bound Nwk 1 – 731 , located in the same plane as the F - BAR dimer and concentrated near its center ( Fig . 2 B , green arrows ) . This mass also could be seen after subtracting the predicted structure of Nwk 1 – 313 from our previously determined structure of Nwk 1 – 428 on membranes with its concave surface down ( 17 ) ( Fig . 2 E ) , suggesting that it represents the 115 - aa alpha - helical stretch that is C - terminal to the F - BAR domain . Interestingly , this mass was missing in the plane of the F - BAR domain in the carbon film Nwk 1 – 731 structure ( Fig . 1 B and D ) , as well as in single - particle class averages of Nwk 1 – 428 either on carbon or oriented with its concave surface up on membrane monolayers ( Fig . 2 F ) . These results suggest that on membrane binding , both the alpha - helical extension and the SH3 domains shift their position relative to the F - BAR domain , switching from occluding the concave surface to a position adjacent to the F - BAR domain ( Fig . 2 G ) . Roles of Nwk SH3 and F - BAR Domains in WASp Activation in Solution . The role of autoinhibitory SH3 domains in regulating F - BAR membrane binding is well established ( 8 , 9 , 16 ) ; however , our structural data showing SH3 - F - BAR associations raise the con - verse question of how these intramolecular interactions affect SH3 regulation of other cellular factors . We previously identified Nwk 1 – 731 as a modest activator of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin po - lymerization by binding to and partly relieving autoinhibition of WASp ( 23 ) . In that study , mutation of the core tryptophan in the Nwk SH3a domain abolished WASp binding and activation , and the core tryptophan in the Nwk SH3b domain was required for a counteracting weak negative effect on WASp activation ( 23 ) . Here we further explored the role of F - BAR – SH3 interactions in WASp - Arp2 / 3 – mediated actin assembly using an autoinhibited fragment of WASp ( WASp Δ 143 , lacking its EVH1 domain ; ref . 23 ) and pyrene - actin assembly assays . Strikingly , both the Nwk SH3a domain ( Nwk 536 – 601 ) and the F - BAR + SH3a domain ( Nwk 1 – 633 ) were much more potent acti - vators of WASp than Nwk 1 – 731 , which contains both SH3 domains ( Fig . 3 A and B ) . Nwk may activate WASp through a combination of SH3 domain - mediated release from the autoinhibited confor - mation of WASp and F - BAR – induced dimerization of WASp ( 26 ) . Indeed , quantification of these effects showed that di - merization of the SH3a domain via a GST tag increased its po - tency to the level of Nwk 1 – 633 ( Fig . 3 C ) .

Nwk activates WASp via its SH3a domain , and that dimerization of SH3a ( by virtue of its connection to the F - BAR dimer ) is im - portant for activity . Furthermore , our data suggest that sequences C - terminal to SH3a negatively impact WASp activation . To better understand how these C - terminal sequences dampen WASp activation , we tested for inhibitory effects independent of the F - BAR domain . Nwk SH3ab ( Nwk 536 – 731 ) showed a reduced ability to stimulate WASp compared with the isolated SH3a domain ( Nwk 536 – 601 ) ( Fig . 3 A and D ) . These results suggest either that SH3b ( or flanking sequences ) bind to SH3a and / or WASp , or that the presence of SH3b ( in cis ) sterically inhibits SH3a activation of WASp . To help distinguish between these two models , we tested the ability of SH3ab or SH3b ( Nwk 608 – 731 ) to affect Nwk - SH3a activity in trans . We found that 3 μ M Nwk - SH3ab failed to inhibit the stimulatory effects of Nwk - SH3a on WASp ( Fig . 3 E ) , suggesting that the sequences C - terminal to SH3a obstruct the stimulatory effects of SH3a on WASp only when present in the same molecule . We next asked whether the Nwk F - BAR domain affects SH3 - mediated WASp activation . The Nwk F - BAR ( Nwk 1 – 428 ) added in trans strongly inhibited the stimulatory effects of both Nwk - SH3a and Nwk - SH3ab on WASp ( Fig . 3 F ) . Importantly , Nwk 1 – 428 had no effect on the Arp2 / 3 complex activated by WASp GST - VCA domain , indicating that inhibition by Nwk 1 – 428 depends on SH3a interactions with regulatory sequences in WASp located outside of its VCA domain ( Fig . 3 F ) . In contrast to these in trans effects , we did not observe autoinhibition when the F - BAR and SH3a do - mains were present in cis in Nwk 1 – 633 , perhaps owing to steric limitations when these domains are in the same molecule ( Fig . 3 B ) . Therefore , in the context of the full - length protein , F - BAR – mediated autoinhibition must occur primarily via Nwk SH3b . We next tested the effects of Nwk 1 – 428 on Nwk – SH3ab – WASp interactions , and found that WASp coprecipitation with GST - Nwk - SH3ab was significantly reduced in the presence of excess Nwk F - BAR ( Fig . 3 G ) . Taken together , these results in - dicate that in addition to the previously characterized role of F - BAR – SH3 interactions in regulating membrane binding , auto - inhibitory interactions between Nwk F - BAR and SH3 domains and in cis effects from the SH3b region work together to inhibit SH3a - mediated WASp activation in solution . Membrane Binding Weakly Activates Nwk for WASp / Arp2 / 3 Actin Assembly . WASp contains a lipid - binding domain ( 27 , 28 ) , and BAR domain proteins , including Cip4 / Toca - 1 , Syndapin , and Snx9 , have been shown to enhance the recruitment of WASp to mem - branes and to stimulate WASp - Arp2 / 3 – mediated actin assembly ( 29 – 31 ) . To examine whether Nwk has similar effects , we per - formed liposome cosedimentation assays using Nwk and WASp . The binding of Nwk 1 – 731 to charged PC / PE / PS / PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 liposomes increased slightly in the presence of WASp , whereas WASp bind - ing to liposomes decreased slightly in the presence of Nwk 1 – 731 ( Fig . 4 A ) . Based on the modest levels of these effects , we conclude that Nwk and WASp together do not have dramatically different membrane - binding properties than those of either protein alone . 0 500 1000 1500 0 500 1000 A c t i n i n po l y m e r ( a r b i t r a t y f l uo r e sc en c e un i t s ) ( 2 ) rxn 1 + 20 nM Arp2 / 3 + 20 nM WASp ( 5 % PS / 10 % PIP 2 ) ( 4 ) rxn 2 + 50 nM Cip4 ( 5 ) rxn 3 + 50 nM Cip4 ( 6 ) rxn 2 + 100 nM Nwk 1 - 731 ( 7 ) rxn 3 + 100 nM Nwk 1 - 731 1 6 2 , 3 4 7 5 P S ( - ) WASp ( + ) WASp 5 % PS 10 % PIP 2 20 % PS 20 % PS 5 % PS 10 % PIP 2 Nwk 1 - 731 R a t e o f a c t i n a ss e m b l y ( a r b i t r a r y f l u o r e sc en c e u n i t s / s e c ) 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 * ( - ) ( + ) PS / PIP 2 ( + ) PS 20 nM Arp2 / 3 + 20 nM WASp + 100 nM Nwk 1 - 731 n . s .

PNAS Early Edition | 5 of 10 C E LL B I O L O G Y P N A S P L U S We next tested the effects of charged liposomes on Nwk activation of WASp / Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly . Activation of WASp by Drosophila Cip4 was potentiated by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membranes , whereas Nwk 1 – 731 activation of WASp was only mod - estly stimulated by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membranes under these conditions ( Fig . 4 B and C ) . In contrast , weakly negatively charged liposomes lacking PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 bound poorly to Nwk 1 – 731 and failed to enhance Nwk 1 – 731 – dependent WASp activation ( Fig . 4 C – E ) . These results suggest that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent lipid binding mod - estly enhances the ability of Nwk to activate WASp , but that sig - nificant autoinhibition persists on the membrane . Consequences of Misregulated Nwk - Induced Actin Assembly in Vivo . We next tested the consequences of misregulated Nwk in vivo , at the Drosophila larval NMJ . At NMJ axon terminals , Nwk local - izes to an endocytically active region called the “ periactive zone , ” adjacent to sites of neurotransmitter release ( 18 ) . nwk mutants exhibit overgrowth of the NMJ , likely owing to a failure to down - regulate synaptic growth signaling by Bone Morphogenic Protein ( BMP ) receptors ( 19 , 23 ) . We previously showed that the F - BAR domain of Nwk is required for its localization to periactive zones and its ability to restrict synaptic growth ; however , the F - BAR domain alone localized aberrantly to the plasma membrane and caused an even more severe synaptic growth phenotype than the null mutant , suggesting that unregulated membrane binding is deleterious ( 16 ) . Here , to test the role of autoregulation in Nwk - induced actin assembly in vivo , we used the binary GAL4 / UAS system to pan - neuronally express Nwk 1 – 631 , analogous to the Nwk fragment that exhibits unregulated actin assembly ( Fig . 3 A and B ) and partially deregulated membrane binding ( 16 ) in vitro , tagged at its C terminus with GFP . Unexpectedly , Nwk 1 – 631 - GFP – expressing NMJs exhibited long , thin protrusions , frequently extending from the terminal bouton of the NMJ but sometimes emanating from boutons more proximal to the entry point of the nerve into the muscle ( Fig . 5 A , yellow ar - rows ) . Nwk 1 – 631 - GFP localized throughout the boutons in a reticular pattern similar to wild type ( WT ) Nwk - GFP , and extended into the protrusions ( Fig . 5 B ) . The protrusions contained the neuronal membrane marker that is recognized by α - HRP antibodies but did not contain active zones , recognized by α - Bruchpilot ( Brp ) anti - bodies , or postsynaptic specializations , recognized by α - Discs Large ( Dlg ) antibodies . This phenotype was present for Nwk 1 – 631 expressed in both WT and nwk mutant backgrounds and , importantly , was not seen in nwk null larvae or in larvae overexpressing WT Nwk - GFP , Nwk 1 – 428 - GFP , or Nwk 1 – 631 with an SH3a point mutation ( W581A ) that abolishes interactions with proline - rich ligands ( 23 ) ( Fig . 6 C ) . This phenotype has not been previously associated with Nwk , but has been observed at early stages of activity - dependent synaptic growth ( 32 , 33 ) , as well as in mutants of the cytoskeletal protein Hts / Adducin ( 34 ) . These structures , known as synaptopods , are thought to mature into “ ghost boutons ” with active zones but no postsynaptic specialization and to ultimately develop into mature boutons ( 32 , 33 ) . In fact , occasional faint accumulations of Dlg could be seen in some Nwk 1 – 631 - dependent synaptopods ( Fig . 5 A ) , and Nwk 1 – 631 - expressing animals showed a significant increase in total boutons ( Fig . 5 D ) , suggesting that synaptopods are bouton precursors . These results indicate that synaptopod formation is a gain - of function phenotype resulting from deregulated Nwk 1 – 631 , and depends on the ability of the SH3a domain - containing region to interact with proline - rich ligands . To ask whether the morphological defects arising from deregulated Nwk correlate with actin cytoskeleton disruption , we selectively la - beled presynaptic actin by neuronally expressing actin - RFP , which on its own did not obviously disrupt NMJ morphology or animal viability . At WT NMJs , actin - RFP localized to puncta that were distrib - uted throughout boutons ( Fig . 6 A ) , disappeared and formed on a ∼ 30 - s timescale ( Movie S1 ) , and have been previously implicated in m C D 8 - G F P N w k - E G F P elav C155 N w k 1 - 631 - E G F P A G F P HR P B r p Nwk - EGFP ; nwk 1 / 2 Nwk 1 - 631 - EGFP ; nwk 1 / 2 B D C Nwk - EGFP Nwk 1 - 631 - EGFP 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 sy nap t opod s / N M J G F P N w k - E G F P elav C155 ; nwk 1 / nwk 2 N w k 1 - 428 - E G F P N w k 1 - 631 - E G F P m C D 8 - G F P N w k - E G F P elav C155 N w k 1 - 631 - E G F P bou t on s / N M J * * * * * * * * * 2 4 6 8 N w k 1 - 631 ( W A ) - E G F P m e r ge m e r ge HR P D l g G F P Fig . 5 .

In stark contrast , the majority of actin - RFP was diffusely localized in Nwk 1 – 631 - expressing NMJs , although it did accumulate in some very small or very large puncta ( arrows and arrowheads in Fig . 6 A ) . We quantified this difference in distri - bution by measuring the number of puncta 0 . 2 – 1 . 5 μ m 2 in diameter , and found significantly fewer puncta in this intermediate size range per NMJ area in Nwk 1 – 631 - expressing NMJs . The mean actin intensity and the number of pixels over our particle selection threshold were similar to those values seen in full - length Nwk - expressing NMJs , suggesting that the distribution , but not the amount , of actin - RFP is altered . Importantly , actin - RFP distribution was not altered in NMJs express - ing only the F - BAR domain of Nwk ( Nwk 1 – 428 - GFP ) , suggesting that the redistribution of actin is Nwk SH3a domain - dependent . The apparently diffuse distribution of actin - RFP in Nwk 1 – 631 - expressing NMJs could reflect either unpolymerized actin or ectopic actin assembly throughout the NMJ . To distinguish be - tween these possibilities , we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) to measure the turnover rate of actin - RFP . Actin - RFP exhibited similar slow and incomplete recovery in NMJs expressing either full - length Nwk - GFP or Nwk 1 – 631 - GFP , suggesting that its diffuse localization on deregulation of Nwk is due to ectopic polymerization rather than to a lack of polymerization ( Fig . 6 C and Movies S1 and S2 ) . In contrast , the free fluorescent protein mCherry recovered completely ( Fig . 6 C and Movie S3 ) . Thus , our results suggest that NMJ morpholog - ical defects on deregulation of Nwk correlate with spatially un - regulated actin assembly . Discussion Here we report that the F - BAR protein Nwk exhibits autoinhibitory interactions between its SH3 and its F - BAR domains both in so - lution and on membranes . In addition to controlling membrane binding , these autoinhibitory interactions also , unexpectedly , inhibit SH3 domain - mediated WASp activation . Similarly , autoregulation is required in vivo to restrict SH3 domain - dependent synaptopod formation , synaptic growth , and actin organization at Drosophila NMJs . Thus , autoregulation of Nwk coordinates the intramolecular control of membrane binding with the intermolecular control of SH3 domain effectors such as WASp ( Fig . 7 ) . A number of BAR and F - BAR proteins are regulated by auto - inhibitory interactions , including endophilin ( 11 , 36 ) , Syndapin ( 8 ) , Amphiphysin ( 9 , 14 ) , Cdc15 ( 37 ) , IRSp53 ( 12 ) , srGAP ( 13 ) , and B 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 time ( sec ) f r a c t i on f l uo r e sc en c e r e c o v e r y Nwk 1 - 631 - GFP + Actin - RFP ( n = 22 ) Nwk - GFP + Actin - RFP ( n = 15 ) Nwk 1 - 631 - GFP + mCherry ( n = 17 ) pre - bleach post - bleach 30 sec 60 sec 90 sec 195 sec Nw k 1 - 631 - G F P + m C he rr y Nw k 1 - 631 - G F P + A c t i n - R F P Nw k - G F P + A c t i n - R F P f r a c t i on a r ea > pa r t i c l e de t e c t i on t h r e s ho l d m ean a c t i n i n t en s i t y ( A U ) # pa r t i c l e s ( 0 . 2 - 1 . 5 µ m 2 ) / N M J a r ea ( µ m 2 ) * * * n . s .

Stanishneva - Konovalova et al . PNAS Early Edition | 7 of 10 C E LL B I O L O G Y P N A S P L U S Nwk ( 16 ) . Although structural information has been obtained for several of these autoinhibited proteins , it has been difficult to de - termine which conformations and interaction interfaces correspond to autoinhibited and / or membrane - bound states . By directly com - paring single - particle EM structures for Nwk on carbon film and on membrane monolayers , we found that the SH3 domains shift from the concave surface to a lateral position on membrane binding . These multiple conformations may be a general feature of F - BAR domain autoregulation , and could explain some of the heteroge - neity of F - BAR – SH3 domain orientations that has been observed in single structural snapshots ( 8 ) . Furthermore , we found that the al - pha - helical extension of the F - BAR domain is located near the membrane - binding concave surface of Nwk , and shifts to a position alongside the F - BAR domain on membrane binding . This structural shift also may apply to other F - BAR proteins , including SRGAP family members and Fes , which have similar C - terminal alpha he - lical regions that in some cases have been shown to be required for their membrane deformation activity ( 13 ) . Until now , the prevailing model has been that the SH3 domains bind and obstruct the concave membrane - interacting surface of the F - BAR domain , and that these interactions are released to allow membrane binding . Our structure of Nwk in solution sup - ports one key aspect of this model , that the SH3 domains bind the concave surface of the F - BAR . In contrast , we found that in membrane - bound structures , the SH3 domains of Nwk are not completely disordered , but instead are on average maintained in positions on either side of the F - BAR domain . Nonetheless , our data cannot rule out the possibility of some heterogeneity in the positions of the SH3 domains in either solution or membrane - bound forms , representing some fraction of protein that exists in an opened or active conformation . We found that full - length Nwk and the Nwk F - BAR domain bind and deform membranes in a similar manner , and also organize into similar higher - order as - semblies on membranes ( Fig . S5 ) ( 16 , 17 ) . These data suggest that the continued association of SH3 domains in the membrane - bound state does not influence membrane remodeling . Instead , our in vitro and in vivo data support an alternative function for persistent SH3 domain association with the F - BAR ; the F - BAR - SH3b domain association constrains SH3a domain activities both in solution and on membranes . To date , there has been little consideration of how F - BAR – mediated autoregulatory interactions might govern SH3 domain activities . In Syndapin 1 , the single autoregulatory SH3 domain contacts the F - BAR near the PxxP - binding groove , suggesting that proline - rich ligands ( perhaps including WASp ) could relieve autoinhibition . In fact , the dynamin proline - rich domain releases Synd autoinhibition of membrane remodeling in heterologous cells and in vitro ( 8 ) . Furthermore , full - length Synd can effectively stimulate WASp ( 31 ) , suggesting that autoinhibition does not af - fect WASp activation . Nwk appears to act by a different mecha - nism , perhaps owing to its second SH3 domain , which may have evolved to allow a more sophisticated mechanism of auto - inhibition and release . This concept is supported by our in vivo data showing that loss of the second SH3 domain leads to gain - of - function effects . PIP 2 - rich membranes exhibit only modest effects on the activity of Nwk on WASp , suggesting that binding to charged membranes is not sufficient for full release from auto - inhibition . Indeed , in the cell , driving F - BAR binding by in - creasing membrane charge alone would not effectively couple the membrane - deforming and SH3 domain activities of Nwk , because Nwk deforms membranes only within a “ sweet spot ” of negative charge , and deformation is disfavored at very high charge ( 16 ) . We also found that WASp only modestly increases lipid binding by autoregulated Nwk . Taken together , these results indicate that the SH3b domain autoinhibitory clamp persists even in the presence of SH3a domain proline - rich ligands and membranes , and are consistent with our structural data . These results also suggest that an additional activation step may be required to release the SH3a domain for interaction with effectors . One possibility is that an additional F - BAR – or SH3b - interacting li - gand releases Nwk from its autoinhibited state . Interestingly , inter - actions between the F - BAR domain of the murine Nwk homolog FCHSD1 and the SH3 domain of SNX9 are associated with en - hanced activation of WASp in vitro ( 21 ) , although it is not clear whether this is the result of release of FCHSD1 autoinhibition or FCHSD1 activation of SNX9 – WASp interactions . Clearly , further work is needed to identify which of a growing number of Nwk ligands are involved in the release from autoinhibition , and how they accomplish this effect ( 19 , 20 , 23 ) . Finally , given this tight autoregulation of membrane binding and SH3 domain interactions , our data suggest that a significant fraction of Nwk in vivo may be in an inactive conformation . We generated a deregulated Nwk by deleting its critical autoregulatory SH3b domain and found that this protein exhibited unpredicted activity at the Drosophila NMJ : SH3a - dependent induction of synaptopods and new boutons . Importantly , the F - BAR domain alone was not sufficient to induce synaptopods , and the SH3b domain was required to inhibit their formation , providing strong in vivo evidence for autoinhibition of SH3a domain activities . Until now , Nwk has been thought to only constrain ( rather than promote ) synaptic growth , by regulating the traffic of growth factor receptors ( 19 , 20 , 23 ) . Our present results suggest that Nwk plays a previously unrecognized role , downstream of its function in constraining signaling , to drive membrane remodeling , synapto - pod formation , and growth of new boutons . Consistent with a physiological role for Nwk in synaptopod formation , the cyto - skeletal protein Hts / Adducin negatively regulates synaptopods at the Drosophila NMJ ( 34 ) , and its homolog γ - Adducin was recently shown to interact with a mouse Nwk homolog ( 38 ) . Synaptopods arise from a Nwk - SH3a domain - dependent activity on WASp or some other SH3a domain ligand . Pinpointing the role of WASp in Nwk - induced synaptopod formation will be challenging , given that WASp has critical , Nwk - independent roles in NMJ morphology both presynaptically and postsynaptically ( 39 , 40 ) . Thus , future work is required to determine precisely which pathways lie downstream of Nwk SH3a in synaptopod formation , and to identify the ligands that release SH3b - mediated autoinhibition in vivo . In summary , our results provide four key insights into Nwk structure , regulation , and mechanism . First , they show that both membrane binding and WASp activation by Nwk are highly autor - egulated in solution . Second , they reveal that autoregulation of SH3a - mediated activities persist even once Nwk is membrane - bound . Third , they imply that additional ligands of Nwk are critical for full release from autoinhibition . Fourth , they uncover potential previously unknown roles for Nwk in synaptic growth in vivo .

Materials and Methods Protein Purification and Interaction Assays . N - terminally His - Xpress – tagged proteins were purified as described previously ( 16 , 17 ) . In brief , proteins were purified from BL21 ( DE3 ) Escherichia coli using cobalt columns , fol - lowed by ion exchange and gel filtration into 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , and 0 . 5 mM DTT . WASp 143 was purified as described pre - viously ( 23 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex was purchased from Cytoskeleton , Inc . Coprecipitation assays with GST - tagged proteins were conducted as de - scribed previously ( 16 ) . Pellets and supernatants were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer and fractionated by SDS / PAGE , followed by immunoblotting with α - WASp antibody P5E1 ( 41 ) . EM and Single - Particle Analysis . For single - particle EM on carbon film , 3 μ L of 0 . 7 μ M Nwk in 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 and 100 mM NaCl were incubated for 30 s on glow - discharged carbon - coated copper grids ( 400 mesh ; Ted Pella ) , and then negatively stained with 1 % uranyl acetate . Samples were then imaged on an FEI Tecnai F30 transmission electron microscope , operating at 200 kV . Images were captured using an Eagle CCD ( FEI ) at 40 , 000 × magni - fication and 1 . 5 – 1 . 9 μ m underfocus . For single - particle EM on lipid monolayers , 1 μ L of 1 mg / mL lipids [ molar percentages of PC / PE / PS / PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 : 65 / 15 / 10 / 10 , with < 0 . 1 % rhodamine - PE for visualization , dissolved in 20 : 9 : 1 chloroform : methanol : water ] was incubated on a 25 - μ L drop of buffer ( 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl ) in a Teflon well in a humid chamber at 4 °C for 1 h , as described previously ( 17 ) . Lipid monolayers were then lifted onto the carbon - coated grids , and the buffer was replaced with a solution containing 0 . 7 μ M Nwk , followed by incubation for 30 min in a humid chamber . Images were recorded on a JEOL 2100 transmission electron microscope , operating at 200 kV at 0° and 45° tilt angles . Images were captured using an Ultrascan 1000XP CCD ( Gatan ) at 40 , 000 × magnification . To obtain a 3D reconstruction of Nwk 1 – 731 on carbon film , particles were selected from the EM images using Boxer ( 42 ) and windowed into 128 × 128 pixel images . These were then filtered and normalized to an SD of 2 , and processed for reference - free classification in IMAGIC ( 43 ) . Multivariate statistical analysis ( 24 , 44 ) on aligned particles produced eigenimages ( Fig . S3 A ) that suggest that particles have twofold symmetry . A total of 3 , 418 particles were categorized into 100 2D class averages . At this stage , 550 particles from class averages that were similar in shape to projections of the F - BAR domain alone were removed . Theseare likely to represent thefraction of membrane - free Nwk in an open conformation with poorly positioned SH3 domains , consistent with the ability of full - length Nwk to bind membranes , albeit at a much lower effi - ciency than the isolated Nwk F - BAR ( 16 , 17 ) . We used the angular reconstitution method ( 24 ) and the back - projection algorithm to obtain a first rough 3D model . The density map was then improved using the FREALIGN program ( 45 ) . We calculated a 3D reconstruction without imposing twofold symmetry , con - firming that the reconstruction still displayed quasi - twofold symmetry ( Fig . S3 D ) . Based on this observation , and the twofold symmetrical eigenimages , C2 sym - metry was applied to the 3D reconstruction at the final stage . To obtain a 3D reconstruction of Nwk 1 – 731 on membrane monolayers , particles were selected from the EM images using Boxer ( 42 ) and windowed into 128 × 128 pixel images . These were then filtered and normalized to an SD of 2 . An initial 3D model of full - length Nwk on lipid monolayers was recon - structed from 647 pairs of particles from tilted images ( 0° and 45° ) in EMAN2 . 1 software using the random conical tilt ( RCT ) method ( 42 ) . This method is well suited for reconstruction from particles with a preferred orientation on the surface . In brief , untilted images were first corrected for contrast transfer function of the electron microscope , and then used for classification to obtain reference - free class averages . Although symmetry was not applied , most of the class averages were twofold symmetric . This was also supported by the pro - duction of eigenimages demonstrating the presence of twofold symmetrical particles ( Fig . S6 A ) . An initial 3D reconstruction containing all Nwk orientations was calculated without imposing symmetry , using the in - plane rotation angles determined by rotational alignment and the preselected tilt angle of 45° using the RCT method implemented in the processing package EMAN2 . 1 . Forthesecondrefinement , alargerdatasetof5 , 017particleswasanalyzed with EMAN2 . 1 . At this stage , particles from class averages with convex - down orientation were removed from the dataset ; 4 , 050 concave - down and side - down oriented particles remained . The density map was then improvedusing the FREALIGN program ( 45 ) . A 3D reconstruction was calculated without imposing twofold symmetry , confirming that the reconstruction still dis - played quasi - twofold symmetry ( Fig . S6 D ) . Based on this observation , and on the twofold symmetrical eigenimages , C2 symmetry was applied to the reconstruction at the final stage . Orientational distributions of Nwk were studied by projection matching . To identify side - lying Nwk 1 – 731 particles , class averages were selected with the highest correlation ( R = 0 . 6 – 0 . 7 ) to the indicated reprojections of the 3D reconstruction ( Fig . 1 B ) , rotated along its long axis in 10° increments . All particles in class averages corresponding to that indicated orientation were pooled into a single class average . To orient Nwk 1 – 428 class averages ( Fig . 1 C ) , we similarly used a set of 20 reference projections , generated by rotating the predicted Nwk 1 – 313 Phyre structure ( 17 ) ( filtered to 20 Å ) along its long axis in 10° increments . To generate unbiased difference maps , matching orientations of Nwk 1 – 428 and Nwk 1 – 731 were aligned using IMAGIC before subtraction . For compar - ing orientational distributions of Nwk 1 – 731 on carbon and on membranes , ∼ 1 , 000 particles were collected at random from each sample and processed in IMAGIC . After classification of the particles , each class sum image was aligned against the Nwk 1 – 313 references . Each class was assigned to the orientation with the best cross - correlation coefficient obtained ( Table S1 ) . To visualize differences between the full - length Nwk and its F - BAR do - main , a low - pass ( i . e . , filtered to 20 Å ) model of the Nwk F - BAR domain ( 17 ) and SH3b domain ( 16 ) was fitted into the 3D reconstruction in Chimera 1 . 9 . We note that this homology was not used for calculating any of our 3D reconstructions , and is shown here for comparative purposes only . Actin Polymerization Kinetics . Rabbit muscle actin [ 5 % ( mol / mol ) pyrene - labeled ] was gel - filtered , exchanged from Ca 2 + to Mg 2 + , and assembled at a final concentration of 2 . 5 μ M as described previously ( 46 ) . Proteins were preincubated with 10 μ M liposomes or control buffer for 30 min before actin assembly reactions ( Fig . 5 ) . Assembly was monitored with a spectrofluo - rometer ( Photon Technology International ) using an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and an emission wavelength of 407 nm . Rates were calculated from slopes of curves in the linear range , and curves were plotted using GraphPad Prism software . Lipid Interaction Assays . Lipid cosedimentation assays were conducted as described previously ( 17 ) . In brief , liposomes were swelled from dried lipid films in 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 and 100 mM NaCl . Specific lipid compositions are indicated in the figure legends . Proteins were then mixed with 1 mg / mL liposomes , incubated for 30 min at room temperature , and then pelleted for 20 min at 18 , 000 × g at 4 °C . Pellets and supernatants were then denatured in Laemmli sample buffer and fractionated by SDS / PAGE , followed by Coomassie staining . Drosophila Genetics and NMJ Analyses . Flies were cultured using standard media and techniques . UAS - Nwk constructs were generated using Gateway technology ( Invitrogen ) in pBI - UASC - eGFP ( 47 ) , as described previously ( 16 ) . These transgenes were injected into flies ( Genetic Services or Rainbow Gene ) , using Φ c381 recombinase at the Attp40 locus ( 48 ) , to ensure that all constructs were in a similar genomic context . For rescue experiments , transgenes were crossed into the nwk 2 mutant background and then crossed to elav C155 ; nwk 1 flies . UAS - actin5C - RFP ( 49 ) was obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center . For analysis of NMJ morphology and protein localization at the NMJ , flies were cultured at low density at 25 °C . Wandering third instar larvae were dissectedincalcium - freeHL3 . 1saline ( 50 ) andfixedfor30mininHL3 . 1containing 4 % formaldehyde before antibody staining . For analysis of NMJ morphology , NMJs on muscle4 , segments A2 A4 from male or female larvae were selected for analysis . NMJs were stained with Alexa Fluor 647 - conjugated α - HRP ( Jackson Immunoresearch ) and α - Dlg or α - BRP primary antibodies ( Developmental Stud - ies Hybridoma Bank ) with rhodamine red - X – conjugated secondary antibodies ( Jackson Immunoresearch ) . For analysis of actin - RFP localization and turnover , NMJsonmuscle4 , segmentsA2 – A4wereselectedforanalysisfrommalelarvaeor the genotype elav C155 / Y ; UAS - Nwk X / + ; UAS - actin - RFP / + / . Spinning - disk confocal imaging was performed at room temperature with a Nikon Ni - E upright microscope equipped with 60 × ( NA 1 . 4 ) and 100 × ( NA 1 . 45 ) oil immersion objectives ( for fixed sample imaging ) , a 100 × ( NA 1 . 1 ) water - dipping objective ( for live imaging ) , a Yokogawa CSU - W1 spinning - disk head , and an Andor iXon 897U EMCCD camera . Laser scanning confocal imaging was conducted at room temperature on an Ni - E inverted micro - scope equipped with a Nikon C2 confocal head and a 60 × ( NA 1 . 4 ) objective . Images were collected using Nikon Elements AR software . For FRAP data acquisition , confocal Z - stacks ( with 1 - μ m steps ) were collected every 15 s for 5 min , with manual focus adjustment . Following acquisition of two or three initial Z - stacks to assess prebleach intensity , terminal boutons representing Stanishneva - Konovalova et al . PNAS Early Edition | 9 of 10 C E LL B I O L O G Y P N A S P L U S < 10 % of the total NMJ area were photobleached using a 405 - nm laser ( 50 % power , 2 s ) , directed to an Andor Mosaic 3 digital micromirror device . Fluorescence microscopy image analysis was performed in FIJI ( 51 ) on aver - age - intensity 2D projections from confocal Z - stacks . Only type Ib innervation on muscle 4 was quantified . Thin NMJ protrusions lacking significant α - Dlg post - synaptic immunoreactivity were defined as synaptopods . Actin - RFP distribution was quantified within the presynaptic area defined by the Nwk - GFP signal . Background signal ( defined from an adjacent area of muscle ) was subtracted from the images , the mean NMJ RFP signal was calculated , and the image was thresholded at 200 % of the mean NMJ signal . This threshold level served as an unbiased method to define actin - RFP particles . Particle numbers and sizes were then calculated from this thresholded image using the “ Particle Analysis ” function of FIJI . For FRAP analysis , XY drift was corrected automatically using the Stackreg rigid body plug - in ( 52 ) , and photobleaching was corrected using the FIJI simple ratio “ Bleach Correct ” function . Mean fluorescence recovery was measured in the bleached area , normalized to prebleach ( 1 ) and postbleach ( 0 ) fluorescence intensities , and analyzed with GraphPad Prism . Statistical Analyses . Statistical significance was calculated with GraphPad Prism software using Student ’ s t test or ANOVA , followed by Tukey ’ s pair - wise test , with * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , and * * * P < 0 . 001 .
