REVIEW ARTICLE Using Relational Reasoning to Learn About Scientific Phenomena at Unfamiliar Scales Ilyse Resnick 1 & Alexandra Davatzes 2 & Nora S . Newcombe 3 & Thomas F . Shipley 3 # Springer Science + Business Media New York 2016 Abstract Many scientific theories and discoveries involve reasoning about extreme scales , removed from human experience , such as time in geology and size in nanoscience . Thus , understanding scale is central to science , technology , engineering , and mathematics . Unfortu - nately , novices have trouble understanding and comparing sizes of unfamiliar large and small magnitudes . Relational reasoning is a promising tool to bridge the gap between direct experience and phenomena at extreme scales . However , instruction does not always improve understanding , and analogies can fail to bring about conceptual change , and even mislead students . Here , we review how people reason about phenomena across scales , in three sections : ( a ) we develop a framework for how relational reasoning supports understanding extreme scales ; ( b ) we identify cognitive barriers to aligning human and extreme scales ; and ( c ) we outline a theory - based approach to teaching scale information using relational reasoning , present two successful learning activities , and consider the role of a unified scale instruction across STEM education . Keywords Size and scale . Relational reasoning . Analogy . Progressive alignment . Corrective feedback Being able to reason about size and scale is central to performance in science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( STEM ; Hawkins 1978 ; Tretter et al . 2006 ) and , as such , are suggested as a unifying theme in science education ( National Research Council 2011 ; American Association for the Advancement of Science 1993 ) . Size refers to an absolute magnitude or value . Scale refers to systems of measurement , which allow for the comparison of relative sizes . For example , years and kilometers are both conventional scales to measure Educ Psychol Rev DOI 10 . 1007 / s10648 - 016 - 9371 - 5 * Ilyse Resnick iresnick @ udel . edu 1 School of Education , University of Delaware , 211C Willard Hall , Newark DE 19716 , USA 2 Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences , Temple University , Philadelphia , PA 19122 , USA 3 Department of Psychology , Temple University , Philadelphia , PA 19122 , USA temporal duration and spatial distance , respectively . Knowing that the Earth formed 4 . 6 billion years ago provides a scale , or measure , to understand that while there is approximately 225 million years between when dinosaurs and humans appear , these two events occurred close together relative to the history of the planet . Many fundamental scientific concepts and discoveries , such as the example above , are at extreme scales , far removed from human experience . Additional examples include the astro - nomical distances involved in space exploration and the rapidly developing field of nanotech - nology — both are based on phenomena occurring at scales that cannot be directly perceived . Unfortunately , scales outside of human perception can be particularly difficult to comprehend . While novices can typically place events and phenomena in the correct sequential order , they fail to understand the magnitude in between ( Jones et al . 2008 ; Miller and Brewer 2010 ; Trend 2001 ; Tretter et al . 2006 ) . In particular , novices have trouble assigning , comprehending , and comparing absolute sizes , especially at extreme scales ( e . g . , Delgado et al . 2007 ; Jones et al . 2008 ; Libarkin et al . 2005 ) . Because scales outside of human perception cannot be directly experienced , comprehension likely requires relational reasoning . Relational reasoning is a basic cognitive mechanism involved in the formation of conceptual categories and encompasses the ability to detect similarities and differences in patterns among objects , concepts , and situations ( James 1890 ; Alexander and the Disciplined Reading and Learning Research Laboratory ( DRLRL ) 2012 ) . Below , we present a theoretical framework for how relational reasoning may support under - standing scales outside of human perception . We then identify cognitive barriers to the application of relational reasoning in understanding scale . Finally , we outline a theory - based approach to teaching scale information using relational reasoning . We present two successful learning activities and consider the role of unifying scale instruction across STEM education . Framework for How Relational Reasoning Supports Scale Understanding Similarities Between Human and Extreme Scales There is converging cognitive , neurocognitive , developmental , and comparative evidence that suggest reasoning about any type of scale ( e . g . , temporal , spatial , abstract ) uses the same neural and conceptual resources ( e . g . , Bueti and Walsh 2009 ; Cantlon et al . 2009 ; Lourenco and Longo 2011 ; Walsh 2003 ; for a review , see Cohen Kadosh et al . 2008 ) . Magnitude information is cognitively stored as a hierarchical combination of both metric and categorical information ( Huttenlocher et al . 1988 ; Huttenlocher et al . 2000 ) . For example , recollection that a wedding took place on June 12 , implicitly includes the higher - level categorical information that the wedding took place in the summer . Such use of categorical information is seen even at extremely large and small scales ( Landy et al . 2014 ; Resnick et al . 2016a , b ) . Variation in estimation thus occurs because of imprecision of category boundaries , with increased variation associated with larger category ranges ( Shipley and Zacks 2008 ; Zacks and Tversky 2001 ) . Because people reason about scales within and outside of human perception in similar ways , analogical reasoning may be especially relevant in understanding ex - treme scales ( Resnick et al . 2016a , b ) . Analogical reasoning is a specific kind of relational reasoning , which refers to aligning structural similarities between a base concept and target concept ( e . g . , Gentner et al . 2007 ; Markman and Gentner 1993a ) . In Educ Psychol Rev an analogy , a new unfamiliar concept is mapped onto a relevant analog accessed from memory to identify systematic correspondences ( Gentner and Holyoak 1997 ) . This mapping process is characterized by a consistent , one - to - one connections between the structural relations of the base and target concepts , and not their features ( Gentner 1982 , 1983 ; Gentner & Gentner 1983 ) . The base concept functions to organize and visualize the target concept , which , in turn , increases understanding and recall ( Orgill and Bodner 2004 ; Simons 1984 ) . Thus , the base concept serves as a structure to help explain or clarify the target concept ( Gentner 1983 ; Markman and Gentner 1993a ) . One way people may come to understand scales far removed from their personal experience is by aligning the structural similarities of extreme scales with familiar human scales . Landy et al . ( 2014 ) suggest that extreme scales are reasoned about by recycling , and not extending , cognitive resources involved in small number processing . In their study , when estimating values on a billion scale , undergraduates first divided the billion scale into smaller subscales , made linear adjustments within each subscale , and then combined the subscales to compromise the original billion scale . Being able to build and use extensive complex units , or categories , is associated with a range of mathematical abilities ( Carpenter and Moser 1983 ; Lamon 1994 ) , because it allows for the comparison of individual items as well as their aggregate ( Callanan and Markman 1982 ) . Indeed , unitizing is characteristic of STEM experts ’ reasoning about scale ( Tretter et al . 2006 ) . Dissimilarities Between Human and Extreme Scales Despite similarities in reasoning at scales within and outside of human perception , there are some notable differences . The same observation at one scale can have a completely different meaning at another scale . For example , while fluctuations in weather indicate something about daily atmospheric conditions , the same weather fluctuations over much longer periods of time can indicate changes in climate . Further , even very small changes in Earth ’ s average temperature over long periods of time can have very large effects , even though temperature can change dramatically within a 24 - h period with no noticeable effect the following day ( Riebeek 2010 ) . Phenomena at different scales can also behave very differently , and , as such , properties of phenomena at a given scale may not be true of other scales . A classic example of scaling effects can be found in the observation of structural strength ; after falling eight feet a horse ’ s bones will break whereas a dog falling , the same amount would be able to walk away ( Galileo 1638 ) . This particular scaling effect is largely due to the ratio of surface area to volume varying as the scale of the object changes and has serious implications in construction . Human scales and extreme scales may also be formally conceptualized using mutually exclusive , or antinomic , organizational structures . For example , while time at human scales is based on temporal durations ( 60 s = 1 min , 60 min = 1 h ) , time at geologic scales is based on the occurrence of important events ( the Mesozoic = age of reptiles ; the Cenozoic = age of mammals ) . Thus , human temporal scales are equally spaced whereas geologic temporal scales are not . Alexander and DRLRL ( 2012 ) have identified three ways in which people reason relation - ally about differences . Anomalous reasoning is the ability to identify deviations from an established pattern ( Dumas et al . 2013 ) . Antithetical and antinomic reasoning both involve being able to reconcile conflicting information ( Alexander et al . 2016 ) , with antithesis pertaining to identifying oppositional relations and antinomy pertaining to incompatible Educ Psychol Rev relations ( Dumas et al . 2013 ) . Reasoning about dissimilarities requires being able to first detect a pattern and then identify subsequent deviations from that pattern ( Dumas et al . 2013 ) and has been implicated as a mechanism for conceptual change ( Gentner 1983 ; Hummel and Holyoak 2003 ; Vosniadou and Mason 2012 ) . Conceptual change can occur because the process of mapping a base concept and target concept not only creates new knowledge , but can also cause the evaluation and reconceptualization of existing conceptual categories and schemas ( Hatford 1993 ) . People may come to understand scales far removed from their personal experience by identifying and reasoning about observed differences between different scales . Fractions , for example , typically represents the first real opportunity for students to reason about numbers other than whole numbers ( Siegler and Lortie - Forgues 2014 ; Siegler et al . 2011 ) . Importantly , the properties of whole numbers are not true of all numbers ; while the multiplication of whole numbers always results in a larger number , the same is not true of fractions . Learning about fractions often results in a deeper understanding of numerical properties because students must reconcile proper - ties of fractions with their previous understanding of number ( Siegler and Lortie - Forgues 2014 ; Siegler et al . 2011 ) . While fractions can be located interstitially between whole numbers , given their different properties , fractions and whole numbers can be categorized as separate scales . Finally , being able to flexibly structure scales with different anchors , or opposing ends of a continuum , is likely an important part of reasoning about scales both within and outside of human experience . There is nothing about a given anchor point that necessarily defines that value as the exact opposite of another anchor point ; however , positioning them as such is a form of antithetical reasoning that can allow for the visualization of relative magnitude . There is convergent evidence human ’ s internal representation of number is along a spatialized number line ( Dehaene et al . 1993 ; de Havia and Spelke 2010 ) . Having an accurate , and thus linear , mental number line supports a range of mathematical reasoning ( Booth and Siegler 2008 ; Laski and Siegler 2007 ; Thompson and Siegler 2010 ) . Children begin with a compressed repre - sentation of number , with smaller numbers occupying a relatively greater proportion of their mental number line and larger unfamiliar numbers occupying less ( see Barth and Paladino ( 2011 ) and Opfer et al . ( 2011 ) for a discussion on mental models of magnitude representation ) . Linearity develops over time for an increasingly wider range of scales ( Booth and Siegler 2006 ; Siegler and Booth 2004 ; Siegler and Opfer 2003 ) , though some may never come to accurately reason about extremely small and large scales ( Landy et al . 2013 ; Schneider and Siegler 2010 ) . Summary of Theoretical Framework Above , we describe a theoretical framework for how relational reasoning supports reasoning about scale . We identified representational similarities between human and extreme scales and suggested that conceptual resources in small number processing are recycled in an analogous fashion to support reasoning about extreme scales . Dissimilarities were also identified , suggesting that extreme scales also require anom - alous , antinomous , and antithetical reasoning . We suggested such reasoning functions to create conceptual change , with antithetical reasoning being particularly important in developing flexibility in representation between scales . Educ Psychol Rev Barriers to Relational Reasoning In the previous section , we present a theoretical framework for how relational reasoning may be involved in understanding scales far removed from human experience . Unfortunately , relational reasoning can fail to bring about conceptual change ( Brown and Salter 2010 ; Duit 1991 ) and can often mislead students , resulting in misconceptions about the target concept that are hard to identify and resolve ( Brown and Clement 1989 ; Duit1991 ; Zook 1991 ; Zook and DiVesta 1991 ; Thagard 1992 ; Clement 1993 ; Zook and Maier 1994 ; Glynn 1995 ; Kaufman et al . 1996 ) . In the current section , we identify barriers to alignment and discuss how they relate to reasoning about scales outside of human perception . While much of the literature reviewed here is on analogy , findings likely apply to all types of relational reasoning because anomaly , antinomy , and antithesis also require the alignment of a base and target concept ( Alexander and DRLRL 2012 ) . There are a number of potential barriers in the alignment of human scales and extreme magnitude . Without a familiar base concept , for example , it can be difficult to identify the structure , making it all but impossible to make relevant connection to another concept ( Gentner 1983 ; Kotovsky and Gentner 1996 ) . While people may have experience with human scales , that does not ensure they will have a firm linear representation of the scale ’ s magnitude . For example , while most humans likely encounter buildings of different sizes every day , it might not be clear how tall each building actually is . It can also be difficult to identify relevant features to align if the base and target concepts have multiple differences , because the two concepts can be aligned in many different ways ( Gentner and Gunn 2001 ; Kokinov and French 2003 ; Markman and Gentner 1996 , 1997 ) . This is particularly problematic when the unrelated features are more salient than the underlying structure . For example , a common analogy when explaining the geologic time scale is to map geologic time onto a 24 - hour clock . The geologic time scale is a system of chronological measurement of Earth ’ s history . Divisions of time are hierarchically organized based on major geologic events . The geologic time scale is conventionally depicted as a spatial representation , with Earth ’ s formation ( 4 . 6 billion years ago ) located at the bottom of a column ( s ) and present day located at the top ( Fig . 1 ) . However , there are a number of salient differences between the geologic time scale and a clock ( Fig . 2 ) . One salient difference is the temporally equal divisions of the clock ( 60 s = 1 min , 60 min = 1 h ) , which may lead novices to erroneously believe that the periods of Earth ’ s history are also evenly spaced ( which they are not ) . In this example , students are focusing on making an analogy between the distribution of divisions of time , and , thus failing to make an analogy between the relative magnitudes of time between events ( e . g . , to understand humans appeared relatively recently ) . There may also be psychological barriers to alignment based on pre - existing spatial or functional characteristics . For example , when mapping an extreme scale to a cross - country road trip , categorization of state properties may influence magnitude recall in unintended ways ( e . g . , Friedman and Brown 2000 ; Stevens and Coupe 1978 ) . Prac - tical constraints on the classroom may also create barriers to understanding . For example , if aligning an extreme magnitude to a roll of toilet paper , the physical size of the classroom may necessitate bending the roll of toilet paper . In this case , it can be difficult to accurately represent the magnitude of the base concept , and , subse - quently , be able to map magnitude relations between scales . Educ Psychol Rev Fig . 1 The geologic time scale . Image from the Geological Society of America Fig . 2 Comparison between a spatial representation of the geologic time scale and the geologic time scale mapped onto a clock . In this example , we highlight three differences between both representations that may interfere with aligning relative magnitudes between the two scales Educ Psychol Rev Scaffolding Relational Reasoning to Support Scale Learning : a Unified Scale Curriculum To address the challenge of teaching magnitudes and phenomena outside of human perception , teachers have adopted a wide range of approaches . For example , one - part - per - billion has been represented as one hamburger in a chain of hamburgers circling the Earth ’ s equator two and a half times ( Kamrin et al . 1995 ) . Geologic time has been mapped onto spatial structures , such as a roll of toilet paper , the Eiffel Tower , or a football field ( Clary and Wandersee 2009 ; Wheeling Jesuit University 2004 ) . The relative size of the universe has been depicted in visualizations like the famous “ Powers of Ten ” video ( Eames and Eames 1968 ) and , more recently , websites like “ The Scale of the Universe 2 ” ( Huang and Huang 2012 ) , which allow users to compare the sizes of different objects at each scale . Unfortunately , instruction does not always improve understanding . Even with these analogies , students continue to struggle comprehending phenomena and magnitudes at extreme scales ( e . g . , Delgado et al . 2007 ; Jones et al . 2008 ; Libarkin et al . 2005 ) . However , there are a number of approaches to scaffold relational reasoning . The act of making comparisons provides a path for experiential learning of relational structure ( Gentner and Namy 1999 ) . The more commonalities that exist between the base and target concepts , and if these commonalities are highlighted , the more salient corresponding relations will be ( Gentner and Namy 2006 ) . Highly similar base and target concepts also facilitate identifying how concepts are different ( Goldstone 1994 ; Markman and Gentner 1993a , 1993b ; Medin et al . 1993 ) . Using similar base and target concepts is not always possible , such as aligning human and extreme scales . The progressive alignment ( Kotovsky and Gentner 1996 ; Thompson and Opfer 2010 ) of scales may alleviate the conceptual dissimilarity between human scales and extreme scales by providing more structural alignment across smaller increases of scale . Alignment of highly similar base and target concepts can increase the uniformity between the two representations , and , thus , helps to extend reasoning to more unfamiliar concepts ( Gentner and Namy 2006 ) . Specifically , the process of comparing two highly similar concepts can make higher - order relations more salient , which promotes identifying the same higher - order relations within unfamiliar concepts ( Kotovsky and Gentner 1996 ) . Progressive alignment also has the added benefit of providing learners with repeated opportunity to practice making relevant alignments ( Resnick et al . 2016a , b ) . A reason why novices may be less accurate when estimating magnitudes at extreme scales compared to human scales is because they have far fewer conceptual categories and less organization ( Trend 2001 ) . Thus , the hierarchical alignment of scale infor - mation can provide structure to populate the unfamiliar scale with salient category boundaries , or landmarks , and to emphasize the relation between scales ( Resnick et al . 2016a , b ) . Hierarchical alignment refers to identifying the relation between all previ - ous concepts when progressively aligning concepts . Seeing the causal relation between phenomena at multiple levels within and between scales , the common characteristics that hold together conceptual categories , and where they exist in the hierarchy can help develop an interconnected internal organization of scale ( Resnick et al . 2012 ) . Educ Psychol Rev Successful Learning Activities Below , we present two learning activities that use a spatial analogy to align the geologic time scale with a smaller more manageable scale — a number line . While the use of a spatial analogy to represent the geologic time scale is common ( Libarkin et al . 2007 ) , it is not always sufficient in fostering a sense of linear scale . For example , having repeated exposure to a conventional spatial representation of the geologic time scale ( Resnick et al . 2013 ) , mapping the geologic time scale onto a human lifespan ( Petcovic and Ruhf 2008 ) , or mapping the geologic time scale to a physical space that learners traverse ( Semken et al . 2009 ) have not been effective in learning the magnitude involved in the geologic time scale ( see Fig . 3 for examples why some common spatial analogies for geologic time may fail ) . The activities below incorporate the theoretical framework presented above for how rela - tional reasoning supports understanding scale along with techniques for overcoming barriers to alignment . Hierarchical Alignment Activity In the hierarchical alignment activity , learners begin by mapping a familiar scale onto a linear number line . The learners then progressively map successively larger scales onto the same amount of space . Using the same amount of space for the analogy provides structural alignment , highlighting one alignable difference — the magni - tude of each scale . In each analogical step , the learners identify the relative locations of all previous scales , hierarchically organizing the scales ( Fig . 4 ) . For example , when learning geologic time , learners may construct ten separate timelines on to a 1 - m space : personal history , an average human lifespan ( from 75 years ago ) , American history ( 520 years ago ) , recorded history ( 5512 years ago ) , human evolution ( 6 million years ago ( Ma ) ) , Cenozoic Period ( 65 Ma ) , Phanerozoic Eon ( 542 Ma ) , Proterozoic Eon ( 2 . 5 billion years ago ( Ga ) ) , Archean Eon ( 3 . 8 Ga ) , and Hadean Eon ( 4 . 6 Ga — the full geologic time scale ) . Here , each timeline is based on conventionally defined boundaries ( e . g . , the Archean , Proterozoic , and Cenozoic are all divisions in the geologic time scale ) that differ by orders of magnitude . In order to hierarchically populate each timeline with events and the relation between scales , the learner would locate all previous scales for each timeline , by calculating how many years each centimeter represented and then how many centimeters were required to represent each scale . The hierarchical alignment activity has been successful in reducing magnitude - based errors in estimation of both geologic events and astronomical distances , which also transferred to more accurate estimations of extreme abstract magnitude ( Resnick et al . 2013 ) . Fig . 3 Examples of analogies for the geologic time scale and potential barriers to alignment . Lightest gray = Phanerozoic , light gray = Proterozoic , dark gray = Archean , darkest gray = Hadean Educ Psychol Rev Corrective Feedback Activity In the corrective feedback activity , learners are presented with scale information , are asked to make predictions about the location of that scale information on a linear scale , and are then immediately provided with corrective feedback . Immediate ( Coulter and Grossen 1997 ) and corrective ( Sharpe et al . 1997 ) feedback promotes student understanding and is specifically effective for learning about unfamiliar magnitudes ( Thompson and Opfer 2010 ) . Learners should be provided with multiple opportunities to make different alignments , which can be implemented across several learning sessions . Spaced practice is beneficial , as students learn better when concepts are taught spaced across learning sessions as opposed to taught repeatedly within a shorter time span ( e . g . , Pashler et al . 2007 ) . When using the corrective feedback activity to teach geologic time , for example , students were first presented with an image of the geologic time scale , which conventionally is nonlinear , and directly alongside a blank linear timeline of equal length ( Fig . 5 ) . Students were asked where a particular division highlighted on the geologic time scale would be located on the linear scale and provided with four response options on the blank timeline . The students used a clicker response system , which is a handheld electronic device that allows entire classes to answer a multiple choice question simultaneously , to make their prediction . Clicker response systems can improve learning and engagement , particularly when paired with immediate corrective feedback ( Kay and LeSage 2009 ) . Students were then provided with immediate corrective feedback on a new slide ( Fig . 6 ) . The corrective feedback slide showed the conventional geologic time scale alongside a linear timeline . In both representations , the major categories of time were depicted , with the estimated division of time highlighted in color and connected by an arrow . Structural alignment is attained by having the conventional geologic time scale , the blank linear timeline , and the corrective feedback timeline all being Fig . 4 Timelines at the hundred and thousand scale in the hierarchical alignment activity . The three previous timelines are located relative to the current scale Educ Psychol Rev Today we are going to talk about the Cambrian & Ordovician Periods . You can see them highlighted on the Geologic Time Scale . Where would these periods be located on the linear time scale on the right ? A B C D Fig . 5 Example of a clicker slide . Students are asked to locate where the highlighted divisions on the geologic time scale would be located on the linear timeline P r e c a m b r i a n P M C Phanerozoic Eon Paleozoic Era Cambrian & Ordovician Periods ( Early Paleozoic ) Fig . 6 Example of slide containing corrective feedback . The conventional geologic time scale is aligned with the linear time scale Educ Psychol Rev of equal length and directly next to one another , showing the corresponding categories of time in the conventional geologic time scale and the corrective feedback timeline , and highlighting the estimated division in both representations using color and connecting them with arrows . The instructor completed ten different alignments over ten classes , with each alignment representing a major category of geologic time . Lecture material was framed around each temporal category . The corrective feedback activity was associated with improved exam scores , more accurate estimations of extreme temporal magnitude , and transfer to more accurate estimations of extreme abstract magnitude ( Resnick et al . 2013 ) . Importantly , when just the slide aligning the geologic time scale with the linear timescale was presented , and students thus did not actively make a prediction about where scale information would be located on a linear scale , there was no improvement in temporal or abstract magnitude estimations and exam scores decreased ( Resnick et al . 2013 ) . While any effect at the exam level may be surprising , it is important to note that the course content was structured around the geologic time scale , and , as such , a better understanding of how categories of geologic time relate to one another is directly relevant for exam perfor - mance . Further , the relation between exam performance and the corrective feedback activity was found across multiple semesters . It is hypothesized that when students understand the scale of geologic time , they are better able to place key course concepts ( such as major evolutionary radiations , plate tectonics , and climate changes ) into context , and , therefore , understand their underlying processes and systems . More unexpected is that just seeing the alignment , without actively making a prediction , actually interfered with learning . Prediction may serve to engage the students into correctly aligning both representations . If students failed to understand the relation between the two representations , they would be left with multiple representations of the same content , which can interfere with understanding ( Ainsworth 1999 ) . Students often have difficulty aligning multiple representations ( de Jong et al . 1998 ) , a characteristic of expert understanding ( Kozma et al . 2000 ) . Unification of Scaling Instruction Across STEM Unifying themes across science education has been proposed as a mechanism to foster a more coherent curriculum ( Tretter et al . 2006 ) . By engaging in the core ideas and practices of science in different contexts , students are able to leverage a common language and familiarity to improve overall understanding ( AAAS 1993 ) . While learning from connected and integrat - ed materials leads to improved retention , critical thinking , and problem solving ( e . g . , Ellis and Fouts 2001 ) , US curriculum has unfortunately been characterized as being fractured and incoherent ( Schmidt et al . 2002 ) . Scale is particularly poised to serve as an important unifying theme in STEM education ; size , and scale represent foundational concepts across the STEM disciplines . One way to unify a scale curriculum is to develop cohesive techniques that help students align the vast set of scales across the sciences , thus building a foundation of scale understanding . The use of relational reasoning to teach concepts at extreme scales is particularly important , as very small and very large scales cannot be directly experienced ( Jones et al . 2009 ) . Using our theoretical framework for how relational reasoning supports understanding of extreme scales , aligned with how people naturally reason about magnitude , is essential in developing an effective scale curriculum . This review found that a scale curriculum should Educ Psychol Rev provide learners with multiple opportunities to align magnitude to a spatial linear representa - tion , using the same amount of space for each alignment ( structural alignment ) . Students should also be engaged in actively making predictions about where scale information would be located on a linear scale ; the use of a clicker response system may be a useful technique . Immediate corrective feedback and spaced instruction are also useful in establishing salient landmarks . Finally , progressive and hierarchical alignments appear to have an additive benefit on learning scale information ( Resnick et al . 2016a , b ) . The hierarchical alignment activity and the corrective feedback activity are examples of how a scale curriculum might be designed . Importantly , both activities are designed to be transposable for teaching any magnitude - based context . Future investigations may examine the benefit of science of learning principles , such as active prediction , immediate feedback , spaced learning , and the use of visual representations . However , it is clear that relational reasoning and analogy are paramount in understanding many foundational scientific concepts and phenom - ena that take place at extreme scales far removed from human experience .
