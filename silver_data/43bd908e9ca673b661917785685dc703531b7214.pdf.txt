Thesis Reference Regulation of dynamin - mediated membrane fission by the N - BAR protein endophilin HOHENDAHL , Annika Abstract Eukaryotic cells are composed of different compartments with defined biological functions . Transport of molecules from one compartment to another , as well as from and to the plasma membrane , occurs via membrane vesicles . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is the most studied pathway for the formation of such a vesicle . The GTPase dynamin mediates the final membrane fission step in this process . This thesis describes the experimental work to clarify how a specific class of crescent - shaped proteins called N - BAR proteins regulate dynamin - mediated membrane fission . Endophilin , one of the N - BAR proteins , was taken as an example . The major experimental technique is the nanotube pulling assay , an in - vitro essay using purified proteins . Other chapters of this thesis explore curvature - inducing properties of the clathrin adapter AP180 and the curvature - dependent activity of yeast Vps34 complex I .

Les cellules eucaryotes contiennent diﬀérents compartiments intracellulaires ayant des propriétés chimiques et des fonctions bi - ologiques bien déﬁnies . Le transport de molécules entre de tels compartiments , ainsi qu’entre un compartiment et la membrane plasmique entourant la cellule , a lieu par l’intermédiaire des vésicules membranaires . L’endocytose médiée par la clathrine est la voie biologique la plus étudiée pour la formation d’une vésicule membranaire . On déﬁnit l’endocytose par la formation d’une vésicule à partir de la membrane plasmique vers l’espace intracellulaire . Les organismes unicellulaires utilisent l’endocytose pour absorber des nutriments depuis l’espace extracellulaire . Chez les eucaryotes multicellulaires , l’endocytose a également pour fonction la régulation du contenu protéique de la membrane plasmique ainsi que la formation de vésicules présynaptiques qui sont ensuite remplies de neurotransmetteurs et libérées dans l’espace intersynaptique suite à l’arrivée d’un potentiel d’action . Dans l’endocytose médiée par la clathrine , la membrane est d’abord courbée en un puits peu profond puis en un bourgeon qui s’accroît sous l’action de la clathrine et de plusieurs autres facteurs . Il y a ensuite constriction du cou du bourgeon et ﬁssion de la membrane grâce à la dynamine , libérant la vésicule de la membrane d’origine . La dynamine forme des spirales autour des cous membranaires et convertit l’énergie d’hydrolyse de guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) en une activité de torsion qui conduit à la constriction du tube membranaire sous - jacent . La famille des protéines BIN / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) , dont le domaine BAR a une forme de croissant , est aussi localisée au niveau du cou du bourgeon à diﬀérents stades de l’endocytose médiée par la clathrine . Un sous - groupe des protéines BAR appelé protéines N - BAR ont une hélice amphipathique N - terminale . De part leur apparition au niveau du cou membranaire juste avant la ﬁssion de la vésicule , de leurs propriétés inductrice de courbure et de leurs interactions avec la dynamine à travers un domaine spéciﬁque , les protéines N - BAR sont des candidates pos - sibles à la régulation de la ﬁssion membranaire . Comme des résultats contradictoires ont été obtenus concernant la nature de cette régulation , le rôle des protéines N - BAR dans la ﬁssion membranaire est toujours incertain . La partie principale de cette thèse décrit le travail expérimental que j’ai mené aﬁn de clari - ﬁer comment les protéines N - BAR régulent la ﬁssion membranaire médiée par la dynamine . L’endophiline , une des protéines N - BAR , a été choisie en tant qu’exemple . Les vitesses et les eﬃcacités de ﬁssion ont été mesurées à l’aide d’un système expérimental dans lequel des pro - téines puriﬁées sont injectées sur un nanotube membranaire étiré à partir d’une vésicule géante ayant une composition lipidique déﬁnie . Mes résultats sont en accord avec un mécanisme par lequel l’endophiline inhibe la ﬁssion membranaire médiée par la dynamine en s’insérant entre les tours de la spirale de dynamine . Dans un autre chapitre , les propriétés inductrices de courbure de l’adaptateur de clathrine iv AP180 sont explorées , utilisant le système expérimental d’extrusion de nanotube . Ces résultats indiquent que la clathrine était nécessaire pour obtenir les propriétés observées d’un mélange de clathrine et d’AP180 . La dernière partie de cette thèse discute les résultats d’expériences en vue de détecter une activité dépendante de la courbure du complexe I de Vps34 de la levure qui est impliqué dans l’autophagie . Un potentiel eﬀet de dépendance à la courbure semble peu manifeste . Ce manuscrit contient par ailleurs une analyse des conséquences structurelles dûes à des mu - tations dans la dynamine et une autre protéine N - BAR , BIN1 / amphiphysine 2 , qui causent la maladie héréditaire musculaire MCN ( myopathie centronucléaire ) dans le cadre d’une revue . Nous proposons un modèle dans lequel les conséquences spéciﬁques aux muscles des mutations dans ces protéines omniprésentes sont dûes aux propriétés d’échaﬀaudage des deux protéines dans le muscle qui sont altérées quand l’équilibre entre les deux protéines est perturbé . Abstract The basic unit of living organisms is the cell . Eukaryotic cells are composed of diﬀerent in - tracellular compartments with deﬁned chemical properties and biological functions . Transport of molecules from one compartment to another , as well as from and to the plasma membrane that surrounds the cell , occurs via membrane vesicles . The most studied biological pathway for the formation of a membrane vesicle is clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Endocytosis denotes the formation of a vesicle from the plasma membrane towards the intracellular space . Unicellular organisms use endocytosis to take up nutrients from the extracellular space . One function of endocytosis in multicellular organisms is also the regulation of the protein content of the plasma membrane and the formation of presynaptic vesicles that are in the following ﬁlled with neurotransmitter and released into the synaptic cleft upon an arriving action potential . In clathrin - mediated endocytosis , the membrane is ﬁrst bent into a shallow pit and later into a growing bud by clathrin and several other factors . The neck of the bud is then constricted and dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion releases the vesicle from the donor membrane . Dynamin forms helices around membrane necks and converts the energy from guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) hydrolysis into a torque that constricts the underlying membrane tube . The crescent - shaped BIN / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) proteins also locate to the bud neck at diﬀerent stages of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . One subgroup of the BAR proteins are called N - BAR proteins due to their N - terminal amphipathic helix . Due to their appearance at the neck just before vesicle ﬁssion , their curvature inducing properties and interaction with dynamin via a speciﬁc domain , N - BAR proteins were proposed to regulate membrane ﬁssion . As contradictory results were obtained concerning the nature of the regulation , the role of N - BAR proteins in membrane ﬁssion is still unclear . The main part of this thesis describes the experimental work that I have done to clarify how N - BAR proteins regulate dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion . Endophilin , one of the N - BAR proteins , was taken as an example . Fission rates and eﬃciencies were measured using an ex - perimental system in which puriﬁed proteins are injected on a membrane nanotube that was pulled from a giant vesicle of deﬁned lipid composition . My results agree with a mechanism by which endophilin inhibits dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion by inserting between dynamin helix turns . In another chapter , curvature - inducing properties of the clathrin adapter AP180 are explored , using the above nanotube pulling assay . These outcomes indicated that clathrin was required for the observed curvature - inducing properties of a mixture of clathrin and AP180 . The last part of this thesis discusses the outcomes of experiments to detect curvature - dependent activity of yeast Vps34 complex I that is involved in autophagy . A potential curvature eﬀect does not seem to be very high . vi Additionally , this manuscript contains an analysis of structural consequences of mutations in dynamin and another N - BAR protein , BIN1 / amphiphysin 2 , which cause the hereditary muscle disease CNM ( centronuclear myopathy ) in the framework of a review . We propose a model in which the muscle - speciﬁc consequences of the mutations in these ubiquitous proteins are due to scaﬀolding properties of both proteins in the muscle which are impaired when the equilibrium between the two proteins is disturbed .

It allows to deliver a molecule to a target compartment that is diﬀerent from the compartment in which it had been synthesised or been before . Cells use this system to adapt to their current environment by changing the concentration of speciﬁc receptors on the plasma membrane or to take up speciﬁc nutrients from the extracellular space . Transport is required as well for molecules that are directly bound to the membrane as well as for molecules that are in solution . An example for molecules in solution are neurotransmitters that are speciﬁcally secreted into the synaptic cleft between two neurons in the brain upon an action potential by exocytosis . For intracellular transport , membrane vesicles are the major carrier . A vesicle is generated from the donor membrane compartment , containing the desired molecules , and then transported to the target compartment where it fuses with the target membrane and delivers the soluble content as well as the lipids and membrane - bound molecules to the new compartment . Diﬀerent machineries are involved in the formation of these vesicles , depending on the speciﬁc transport pathway . The most studied endocytic pathway is clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . The sequence of events during CME is depicted in Figure 1 . 1 . The formation of a vesicle is nucleated (cid:48)(cid:87)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:67)(cid:86)(cid:75)(cid:81)(cid:80)

Nucleation : FCH domain only ( FCHO ) proteins bind phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) - rich zones of the plasma membrane and recruit EPS15 – EPS15R ( EGFR pathway substrate 15 – EPS15 - related ) and intersectins to initiate clathrin - coated pit formation by recruiting adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) . Cargo selection : AP2 recruits several classes of receptors directly through its μ - subunit and σ - subunit . Cargo - specific adaptors ( for example , stonin , HRB and Numb ) bind to AP2 appendage domains and recruit specific receptors to the AP2 hub . Coat assembly : clathrin triskelia are recruited by the AP2 hub and polymerize in hexagons and pentagons to form the clathrin coat around the nascent pit . Scission : the GTPase dynamin is recruited at the neck of the forming vesicle by BAR domain - containing proteins , where it self - polymerizes and , upon GTP hydrolysis , induces membrane scission . The actin machinery module can be added at this stage for actin polymerization at the neck of the pit , which can aid in vesicle production ( not shown ) . Uncoating : auxilin or cyclin G - associated kinase ( GAK ) recruit the ATPase heat shock cognate 70 ( HSC70 ) to disassemble the clathrin coat and produce an endocytic vesicle containing the cargo molecules . Synaptojanin probably facilitates this by releasing adaptor proteins from the vesicle membrane through its PtdIns lipid phosphatase activity . The components of the clathrin machinery are then freed and become available for another round of clathrin - coated vesicle formation . b | The clathrin network . The protein – protein interactions underlying the different stages of vesicle progression are shown . Major hubs are obvious because of their central location in the network and the large number of interacting molecules . They are essential for pathway progression and are denoted by the central coloured circles . Possible pathways of progression between hubs are shown with thicker lines . c | Effects of depletion of different components of the clathrin machinery . Epithelial cells expressing FCHO2 tagged with red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) , AP2 tagged on the σ 2 subunit with enhanced green fluorescent protein ( σ 2 – EGFP ) and clathrin tagged with blue fluorescent protein ( BFP ) show arrests at each successive stage in clathrin - coated pit formation after perturbation of major hubs . FCHO protein depletion through RNA interference ( RNAi ) inhibits AP2 and clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane ( and both remain diffuse and cytosolic ) . AP2 RNAi abrogates clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane but not FCHO2 initial focus formation ( dense red spots ) . Clathrin RNAi blocks maturation during cargo selection , when FCHO2 and AP2 are clustered ( yellow dots , arrows ) . Dynamin inhibition ( by dynasore ) blocks clathrin - coated pits at a stage just before membrane scission ( white dots , arrows ) .

coated vesicle formation . Nucleation : FCH domain only ( FCHO ) proteins bind phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) - rich zones of the plasma membrane and recruit EPS15 – EPS15R ( EGFR pathway substrate 15 – EPS15 - related ) and intersectins to initiate clathrin - coated pit formation by recruiting adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) . Cargo selection : AP2 recruits several classes of receptors directly through its μ - subunit and σ - subunit . Cargo - specific adaptors ( for example , stonin , HRB and Numb ) bind to AP2 appendage domains and recruit specific receptors to the AP2 hub . Coat assembly : clathrin triskelia are recruited by the AP2 hub and polymerize in hexagons and pentagons to form the clathrin coat around the nascent pit . Scission : the GTPase dynamin is recruited at the neck of the forming vesicle by BAR domain - containing proteins , where it self - polymerizes and , upon GTP hydrolysis , induces membrane scission . The actin machinery module can be added at this stage for actin polymerization at the neck of the pit , which can aid in vesicle production ( not shown ) . Uncoating : auxilin or cyclin G - associated kinase ( GAK ) recruit the ATPase heat shock cognate 70 ( HSC70 ) to disassemble the clathrin coat and produce an endocytic vesicle containing the cargo molecules . Synaptojanin probably facilitates this by releasing adaptor proteins from the vesicle membrane through its PtdIns lipid phosphatase activity . The components of the clathrin machinery are then freed and become available for another round of clathrin - coated vesicle formation . b | The clathrin network . The protein – protein interactions underlying the different stages of vesicle progression are shown . Major hubs are obvious because of their central location in the network and the large number of interacting molecules . They are essential for pathway progression and are denoted by the central coloured circles . Possible pathways of progression between hubs are shown with thicker lines . c | Effects of depletion of different components of the clathrin machinery . Epithelial cells expressing FCHO2 tagged with red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) , AP2 tagged on the σ 2 subunit with enhanced green fluorescent protein ( σ 2 – EGFP ) and clathrin tagged with blue fluorescent protein ( BFP ) show arrests at each successive stage in clathrin - coated pit formation after perturbation of major hubs . FCHO protein depletion through RNA interference ( RNAi ) inhibits AP2 and clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane ( and both remain diffuse and cytosolic ) . AP2 RNAi abrogates clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane but not FCHO2 initial focus formation ( dense red spots ) . Clathrin RNAi blocks maturation during cargo selection , when FCHO2 and AP2 are clustered ( yellow dots , arrows ) . Dynamin inhibition ( by dynasore ) blocks clathrin - coated pits at a stage just before membrane scission ( white dots , arrows ) .

coated vesicle formation . Nucleation : FCH domain only ( FCHO ) proteins bind phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) - rich zones of the plasma membrane and recruit EPS15 – EPS15R ( EGFR pathway substrate 15 – EPS15 - related ) and intersectins to initiate clathrin - coated pit formation by recruiting adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) . Cargo selection : AP2 recruits several classes of receptors directly through its μ - subunit and σ - subunit . Cargo - specific adaptors ( for example , stonin , HRB and Numb ) bind to AP2 appendage domains and recruit specific receptors to the AP2 hub . Coat assembly : clathrin triskelia are recruited by the AP2 hub and polymerize in hexagons and pentagons to form the clathrin coat around the nascent pit . Scission : the GTPase dynamin is recruited at the neck of the forming vesicle by BAR domain - containing proteins , where it self - polymerizes and , upon GTP hydrolysis , induces membrane scission . The actin machinery module can be added at this stage for actin polymerization at the neck of the pit , which can aid in vesicle production ( not shown ) . Uncoating : auxilin or cyclin G - associated kinase ( GAK ) recruit the ATPase heat shock cognate 70 ( HSC70 ) to disassemble the clathrin coat and produce an endocytic vesicle containing the cargo molecules . Synaptojanin probably facilitates this by releasing adaptor proteins from the vesicle membrane through its PtdIns lipid phosphatase activity . The components of the clathrin machinery are then freed and become available for another round of clathrin - coated vesicle formation . b | The clathrin network . The protein – protein interactions underlying the different stages of vesicle progression are shown . Major hubs are obvious because of their central location in the network and the large number of interacting molecules . They are essential for pathway progression and are denoted by the central coloured circles . Possible pathways of progression between hubs are shown with thicker lines . c | Effects of depletion of different components of the clathrin machinery . Epithelial cells expressing FCHO2 tagged with red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) , AP2 tagged on the σ 2 subunit with enhanced green fluorescent protein ( σ 2 – EGFP ) and clathrin tagged with blue fluorescent protein ( BFP ) show arrests at each successive stage in clathrin - coated pit formation after perturbation of major hubs . FCHO protein depletion through RNA interference ( RNAi ) inhibits AP2 and clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane ( and both remain diffuse and cytosolic ) . AP2 RNAi abrogates clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane but not FCHO2 initial focus formation ( dense red spots ) . Clathrin RNAi blocks maturation during cargo selection , when FCHO2 and AP2 are clustered ( yellow dots , arrows ) .

coated vesicle formation . Nucleation : FCH domain only ( FCHO ) proteins bind phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) - rich zones of the plasma membrane and recruit EPS15 – EPS15R ( EGFR pathway substrate 15 – EPS15 - related ) and intersectins to initiate clathrin - coated pit formation by recruiting adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) . Cargo selection : AP2 recruits several classes of receptors directly through its μ - subunit and σ - subunit . Cargo - specific adaptors ( for example , stonin , HRB and Numb ) bind to AP2 appendage domains and recruit specific receptors to the AP2 hub . Coat assembly : clathrin triskelia are recruited by the AP2 hub and polymerize in hexagons and pentagons to form the clathrin coat around the nascent pit . Scission : the GTPase dynamin is recruited at the neck of the forming vesicle by BAR domain - containing proteins , where it self - polymerizes and , upon GTP hydrolysis , induces membrane scission . The actin machinery module can be added at this stage for actin polymerization at the neck of the pit , which can aid in vesicle production ( not shown ) . Uncoating : auxilin or cyclin G - associated kinase ( GAK ) recruit the ATPase heat shock cognate 70 ( HSC70 ) to disassemble the clathrin coat and produce an endocytic vesicle containing the cargo molecules . Synaptojanin probably facilitates this by releasing adaptor proteins from the vesicle membrane through its PtdIns lipid phosphatase activity . The components of the clathrin machinery are then freed and become available for another round of clathrin - coated vesicle formation . b | The clathrin network . The protein – protein interactions underlying the different stages of vesicle progression are shown . Major hubs are obvious because of their central location in the network and the large number of interacting molecules . They are essential for pathway progression and are denoted by the central coloured circles . Possible pathways of progression between hubs are shown with thicker lines . c | Effects of depletion of different components of the clathrin machinery . Epithelial cells expressing FCHO2 tagged with red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) , AP2 tagged on the σ 2 subunit with enhanced green fluorescent protein ( σ 2 – EGFP ) and clathrin tagged with blue fluorescent protein ( BFP ) show arrests at each successive stage in clathrin - coated pit formation after perturbation of major hubs . FCHO protein depletion through RNA interference ( RNAi ) inhibits AP2 and clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane ( and both remain diffuse and cytosolic ) . AP2 RNAi abrogates clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane but not FCHO2 initial focus formation ( dense red spots ) . Clathrin RNAi blocks maturation during cargo selection , when FCHO2 and AP2 are clustered ( yellow dots , arrows ) . Dynamin inhibition ( by dynasore ) blocks clathrin - coated pits at a stage just before membrane scission ( white dots , arrows ) . AAK , AP2 - associated protein kinase 1 ; ARP2 / 3 , actin - related protein 2 / 3 ; DAB2 , Disabled homologue 2 ; HIP1R , HIP1 - related ; N - WASP , neural Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ; NECAP , adaptin ear - binding coat - associated protein ; SNX9 , sorting nexin 9 .

coated vesicle formation . Nucleation : FCH domain only ( FCHO ) proteins bind phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) - rich zones of the plasma membrane and recruit EPS15 – EPS15R ( EGFR pathway substrate 15 – EPS15 - related ) and intersectins to initiate clathrin - coated pit formation by recruiting adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) . Cargo selection : AP2 recruits several classes of receptors directly through its μ - subunit and σ - subunit . Cargo - specific adaptors ( for example , stonin , HRB and Numb ) bind to AP2 appendage domains and recruit specific receptors to the AP2 hub . Coat assembly : clathrin triskelia are recruited by the AP2 hub and polymerize in hexagons and pentagons to form the clathrin coat around the nascent pit . Scission : the GTPase dynamin is recruited at the neck of the forming vesicle by BAR domain - containing proteins , where it self - polymerizes and , upon GTP hydrolysis , induces membrane scission . The actin machinery module can be added at this stage for actin polymerization at the neck of the pit , which can aid in vesicle production ( not shown ) . Uncoating : auxilin or cyclin G - associated kinase ( GAK ) recruit the ATPase heat shock cognate 70 ( HSC70 ) to disassemble the clathrin coat and produce an endocytic vesicle containing the cargo molecules . Synaptojanin probably facilitates this by releasing adaptor proteins from the vesicle membrane through its PtdIns lipid phosphatase activity . The components of the clathrin machinery are then freed and become available for another round of clathrin - coated vesicle formation . b | The clathrin network . The protein – protein interactions underlying the different stages of vesicle progression are shown . Major hubs are obvious because of their central location in the network and the large number of interacting molecules . They are essential for pathway progression and are denoted by the central coloured circles . Possible pathways of progression between hubs are shown with thicker lines . c | Effects of depletion of different components of the clathrin machinery . Epithelial cells expressing FCHO2 tagged with red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) , AP2 tagged on the σ 2 subunit with enhanced green fluorescent protein ( σ 2 – EGFP ) and clathrin tagged with blue fluorescent protein ( BFP ) show arrests at each successive stage in clathrin - coated pit formation after perturbation of major hubs . FCHO protein depletion through RNA interference ( RNAi ) inhibits AP2 and clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane ( and both remain diffuse and cytosolic ) . AP2 RNAi abrogates clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane but not FCHO2 initial focus formation ( dense red spots ) . Clathrin RNAi blocks maturation during cargo selection , when FCHO2 and AP2 are clustered ( yellow dots , arrows ) . Dynamin inhibition ( by dynasore ) blocks clathrin - coated pits at a stage just before membrane scission ( white dots , arrows ) .

coated vesicle formation . Nucleation : FCH domain only ( FCHO ) proteins bind phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) - rich zones of the plasma membrane and recruit EPS15 – EPS15R ( EGFR pathway substrate 15 – EPS15 - related ) and intersectins to initiate clathrin - coated pit formation by recruiting adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) . Cargo selection : AP2 recruits several classes of receptors directly through its μ - subunit and σ - subunit . Cargo - specific adaptors ( for example , stonin , HRB and Numb ) bind to AP2 appendage domains and recruit specific receptors to the AP2 hub . Coat assembly : clathrin triskelia are recruited by the AP2 hub and polymerize in hexagons and pentagons to form the clathrin coat around the nascent pit . Scission : the GTPase dynamin is recruited at the neck of the forming vesicle by BAR domain - containing proteins , where it self - polymerizes and , upon GTP hydrolysis , induces membrane scission . The actin machinery module can be added at this stage for actin polymerization at the neck of the pit , which can aid in vesicle production ( not shown ) . Uncoating : auxilin or cyclin G - associated kinase ( GAK ) recruit the ATPase heat shock cognate 70 ( HSC70 ) to disassemble the clathrin coat and produce an endocytic vesicle containing the cargo molecules . Synaptojanin probably facilitates this by releasing adaptor proteins from the vesicle membrane through its PtdIns lipid phosphatase activity . The components of the clathrin machinery are then freed and become available for another round of clathrin - coated vesicle formation . b | The clathrin network . The protein – protein interactions underlying the different stages of vesicle progression are shown . Major hubs are obvious because of their central location in the network and the large number of interacting molecules . They are essential for pathway progression and are denoted by the central coloured circles . Possible pathways of progression between hubs are shown with thicker lines . c | Effects of depletion of different components of the clathrin machinery . Epithelial cells expressing FCHO2 tagged with red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) , AP2 tagged on the σ 2 subunit with enhanced green fluorescent protein ( σ 2 – EGFP ) and clathrin tagged with blue fluorescent protein ( BFP ) show arrests at each successive stage in clathrin - coated pit formation after perturbation of major hubs . FCHO protein depletion through RNA interference ( RNAi ) inhibits AP2 and clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane ( and both remain diffuse and cytosolic ) . AP2 RNAi abrogates clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane but not FCHO2 initial focus formation ( dense red spots ) . Clathrin RNAi blocks maturation during cargo selection , when FCHO2 and AP2 are clustered ( yellow dots , arrows ) . Dynamin inhibition ( by dynasore ) blocks clathrin - coated pits at a stage just before membrane scission ( white dots , arrows ) .

Adapted from : McMahon and Boucrot ( 2011 ) . 2 General Introduction by binding of a group of scaﬀold proteins to phosphoinositide - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) - rich areas of the plasma membrane which deform the membrane into a shallow pit ( Figure 1 . 1A , McMahon and Boucrot ( 2011 ) ) . This group – including F - BAR proteins , EGFR pathway substrate 15 ( EPS15 ) , intersectins and clathrin adapters ( such as adaptor protein complex 2 ( AP2 ) ) – selects and clusters cargo and nucleates actin ( Figure 1 . 1B ; Henne et al . ( 2010 ) ; Taylor et al . ( 2011 ) ; Ferguson and De Camilli ( 2012 ) ) . Clathrin binds to these adapters and forms a scaﬀold that further induces membrane curvature , deforming the membrane into a bud ( Figure 1 . 1C ) . Dynamin and N - BAR proteins ( such as endophilin ) accumulate at the neck of the pit ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) , reducing the bud neck diameter ( Figure 1 . 1D ) . Dynamin then induces membrane ﬁssion , which liberates the vesicle from the donor membrane and completes the generation of a vesicle . The cycle is completed by auxilin or cyclin G - associated kinase ( GAK ) which recruit heat shock cognate 70 ( HSC70 ) that disassembles the clathrin coat ( Figure 1 . 1E ; Ungewickell et al . ( 1995 ) ; Schlossman et al . ( 1984 ) ) . 1 . 2 Goal Of This Thesis Work Membrane ﬁssion , the last step of the formation of a membrane vesicle , was the focus of this thesis work . Dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion had been reconstituted in vitro and no other proteins than dynamin were required for ﬁssion to occur ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . In contrast , the role of N - BAR proteins and their involvement in ﬁssion is highly debated in the ﬁeld . Strikingly , N - BAR proteins also appear at the bud neck just before vesicle ﬁssion like dynamin ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Contradictory results were obtained using diﬀerent ﬁssion assays and were proposed to either activate or inhibit ﬁssion ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Yoshida et al . , 2004 ; Meinecke et al . , 2013 ; Neumann and Schmid , 2013 ) . The goal of my thesis was to clarify the role of the N - BAR protein endophilin in dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion .

This section will give an overview of its discovery , role in endocytosis , structure , the link between dynamin polymerisation and GTPase activity and describes the currently discussed models for dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion . 4 Molecular Regulation Of Dynamin - Mediated Membrane Fission 2 . 1 . 1 Discovery And Role In Endocytosis Dynamin was discovered almost three decades ago as an ATPase that interacted with micro - tubules ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1999 ) , and later found to be a GTPase . In the same year , the temperature sensitive ﬂy mutant shibire was found to be unable to ﬂy or move in general at the non - permissive temperature . The reason for this block was the depletion of synaptic vesi - cles in active synapses . Clathrin - coated structures were stalled at the ﬁssion step , indicating a block in endocytosis ( Koenig and Ikeda , 1989 ) . Thus , synaptic vesicle recycling was aﬀected by the mutation , and as synaptic vesicles are needed for signal transmission , the depletion of synaptic vesicles might have caused the paralysis . The shibire gene was later found to encode the Drosophila dynamin ( van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 ) , suggesting that dynamin acts in vesicular transport . The reduction of synaptic vesicles and accumulation of clathrin - coated pits in the synaptic bulb can also be observed when knocking out the mammalian dynamin in mice ( dynamin 1 and dynamin 3 double knockout ; Figure 2 . 1 ; Raimondi et al . ( 2011 ) ; Ferguson and De Camilli ( 2012 ) ) .

The fact that all three dynamins are expressed in neu­ rons , with both dynamin 1 and dynamin 3 being expressed primarily in the nervous system , raises questions about the specific roles that each of the three dynamins has here 17 , 21 .

Its conditional knockout using the Cre – loxP system in early neuronal progenitors 137 , prior to the onset of expression of dynamin 1 and dynamin 3 , drastically impairs brain develop ment ( S . M .

However , conditional deletion of dynamin 2 in neurons at an early postnatal stage 138 does not affect mouse viability or cause any discernible neurological phenotype ( S . M . F . and P . D .

Dynamin 1 is present at high concentrations in the nervous syste m , is concentrated at synapses and shows markedly increased levels during synaptogenesis 17 , 18 .

Giovedi , S . M . F . and P . D . C . , unpublished observa­ tions ) . On the basis of these considerations , dynamin 1 was expected to be essential for synaptic vesicle endocytosis .

By contrast , reports of variability in the size and dynamic behaviour of clathrin structures in mammalian cells have raised questions about the underlying biological significance of the different populations and about the regulatory mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneity . Furthermore , this heterogeneity has limited the ability to perform a global analysis of protein dynamics to detect the phenotypes that are caused when endocytic protein functions are impaired . Our data suggest that conventional overexpression - based methods in mammalian cells contribute to heterogeneity in the size and dynamics of clathrin - coated structures , thus warranting the use of genome - edited cells for re - examination of the effects of cargo , cell physiology and function - perturbing manipulations on endocytic dynamics and productivity . ZFN - mediated genome editing has several advantages over conven - tional methods for generating cell lines that stably express fluorescent fusion proteins . First , conventional methods require selection of a single splice variant for study and , consequently , dominant expression of a sin - gle isoform . Moreover , these methods result in transgene overexpression , leading to total protein levels ( comprising both tagged and untagged forms ) that are significantly higher than in wild - type cells . Although transient overexpression methods can generate cells that express a fusion protein closer to physiological levels , they often result in heterogene - ous cell - to - cell protein expression levels , necessitating experimental bias in the selection of ‘low - expression’ cells for study . By contrast , a ZFN - mediated strategy allows for creation of single - or multiple - allele tagged cell lines for greater control of a tagged protein’s expression level . Furthermore , our tagging strategy preserves native RNA splicing , ena - bling the analysis of protein isoforms at physiological stoichiometry and levels . Although such an approach precludes an analysis of individual splice variants , alternative ZFNs and donors could be readily designed to achieve exclusive expression of a desired isoform at endogenous levels . Although the need to perturb a biological process to observe it is a general shortcoming of experimental research , we believe that our studies strike a balance between modifying a cell to faithfully report on its biology and retaining its natural state . In particular , the ability to engineer isogenic human cells using ZFN technology 21 , 30 , 31 in a manner that has been the gold standard in budding and fission yeast for decades has the potential to transform the way that researchers study dynamic processes .

All rights reserved A B t e c h n i c a l R e p o Rt and for extensive mutant analysis of the contributions of individual pro - teins to CME dynamics 8 . By contrast , reports of variability in the size and dynamic behaviour of clathrin structures in mammalian cells have raised questions about the underlying biological significance of the different populations and about the regulatory mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneity . Furthermore , this heterogeneity has limited the ability to perform a global analysis of protein dynamics to detect the phenotypes that are caused when endocytic protein functions are impaired . Our data suggest that conventional overexpression - based methods in mammalian cells contribute to heterogeneity in the size and dynamics of clathrin - coated structures , thus warranting the use of genome - edited cells for re - examination of the effects of cargo , cell physiology and function - perturbing manipulations on endocytic dynamics and productivity . ZFN - mediated genome editing has several advantages over conven - tional methods for generating cell lines that stably express fluorescent fusion proteins . First , conventional methods require selection of a single splice variant for study and , consequently , dominant expression of a sin - gle isoform . Moreover , these methods result in transgene overexpression , leading to total protein levels ( comprising both tagged and untagged forms ) that are significantly higher than in wild - type cells . Although transient overexpression methods can generate cells that express a fusion protein closer to physiological levels , they often result in heterogene - ous cell - to - cell protein expression levels , necessitating experimental bias in the selection of ‘low - expression’ cells for study . By contrast , a ZFN - mediated strategy allows for creation of single - or multiple - allele tagged cell lines for greater control of a tagged protein’s expression level . Furthermore , our tagging strategy preserves native RNA splicing , ena - bling the analysis of protein isoforms at physiological stoichiometry and levels . Although such an approach precludes an analysis of individual splice variants , alternative ZFNs and donors could be readily designed to achieve exclusive expression of a desired isoform at endogenous levels . Although the need to perturb a biological process to observe it is a general shortcoming of experimental research , we believe that our studies strike a balance between modifying a cell to faithfully report on its biology and retaining its natural state . In particular , the ability to engineer isogenic human cells using ZFN technology 21 , 30 , 31 in a manner that has been the gold standard in budding and fission yeast for decades has the potential to transform the way that researchers study dynamic processes .

Scale bar , 10 µ m . While there is a big family of dynamin - related proteins in pro - and eukaryotes with roles in membrane remodelling , the most studied members are the classical dynamins from mammals . Mammals have three dynamin paralogs with 70 % sequence identity and same domain structure ( see Section 2 . 1 . 2 ) , each of the paralogs with several splice variants ( UniProt ) . Dynamin 1 is by far the predominant variant in the brain and is neuron - speciﬁc ( Scaife and Margolis , 1990 ; Sontag et al . , 1994 ; Powell and Robinson , 1995 ) . Dynamin 2 is ubiquitously expressed and considered to be responsible for house - keeping endocytosis ( Cook et al . , 1994 ; Sontag et al . , 1994 ; Diatloﬀ - Zito et al . , 1995 ) . Dynamin 3 is expressed in neurons , lung and testis ( Nakata et al . , 1993 ; Cook et al . , 1996 ) . When observed by total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , dynamin appears as transient punctae that colocalise with clathrin ( Figure 2 . 2 ; Doyon et al . ( 2011 ) ) . The lifetime of the punctae was in the range of 20 – 40 seconds ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ) , depending on the exact genome editing . Dynamin accumulated massively a few seconds before vesicle ﬁssion ( Taylor et al . ( 2011 ) , see also Figure 2 . 9 ) , suggesting a role in the ﬁssion step . 2 . 1 . 2 Dynamin Structure And Assembly The domain structure of a dynamin monomer and the structure of the dynamin 3 tetramer ( Reubold et al . , 2015 ) are shown in Figure 2 . 3 . Dynamin contains a GTPase ( G ) domain ( orange ) that hydrolyses GTP . The pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain binds to the membrane through a speciﬁc interaction with phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) . The stalk regions mediate dimerisation ( Figure 2 . 3 , interface 2 ) , tetramerisation ( Muhlberg et al . ( 1997 ) , Figure 2 . 3 , interfaces 1 and 3 , Reubold et al . ( 2015 ) ) and thus oligomerisation . The bundle signalling element ( BSE ) is a ﬂexible linker that connects the G domain with the rest of the protein . The proline - rich domain ( PRD ) mediates interactions between dynamin and SH3 - domain containing proteins such as certain BAR proteins ( see Section 2 . 2 ) . 6 Molecular Regulation Of Dynamin - Mediated Membrane Fission A B G domain BSE BSE BSE stalk / middle PH stalk / GED PRD LETTER doi : 10 . 1038 / nature14880 Crystal structure of the dynamin tetramer Thomas F .

Dynamin forms predo - minantly tetramers in the cytosol , which oligomerize at the neck of clathrin - coated vesicles to mediate constriction and subsequent scission of the membrane 1 . Previous studies have described the architecture of dynamin dimers 2 , 3 , but the molecular determinants for dynamin assembly and its regulation have remained unclear . Here we present the crystal structure of the human dynamin tetramer in the nucleotide - free state . Combining structural data with mutational studies , oligomerization measurements and Markov state models of molecular dynamics simulations , we sug - gest a mechanism by which oligomerization of dynamin is linked to the release of intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions . We elu - cidate how mutations that interfere with tetramer formation and autoinhibition can lead to the congenital muscle disorders Charcot – Marie – Tooth neuropathy 4 and centronuclear myopathy 5 , respectively . Notably , the bent shape of the tetramer explains how dynamin assembles into a right - handed helical oligomer of defined diameter , which has direct implications for its function in mem - brane constriction . The three highly conserved vertebrate isoforms of dynamin contain five distinct domains ( Extended Data Fig . 1a ) : an N - terminal GTPase ( G ) domain mediating nucleotide binding and hydrolysis , a bundle signalling element ( BSE ) , a stalk , a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain involved in lipid binding , and a proline - rich domain ( PRD ) mediating interactions with scaffolding proteins containing BAR - and SH3 - domains 6 . To exert its function in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , dynamin assembles via the stalks into a helical array surround - ing the necks of invaginating clathrin - coated pits 7 , 8 . Dimerization of GTP - bound G domains from neighbouring helical rungs induces GTP hydrolysis 9 . The ensuing conformational changes are thought to be transmitted from the G domain via the BSE to the stalk , resulting in a sliding motion of adjacent helix rungs , concomitant helix constric - tion 10 , and eventually membrane scission . The inherent tendency to form large assemblies at high protein concentrations has hampered crystallization of dynamin in the past .

The G domain sits on a helical bundle , known as the bundle signalling element ( BSE ) 30 or neck 40 , which is formed by three helices derived from sequences at the N­terminal and C­terminal sides of the G domain and from the C­terminal region of the GED , respectively ( FIG . 2 ) . Consistent with the idea that this region of the GED is in close physical proximity with , and is functionally linked to , the G domain , a screen for suppressor mutations of a mutation in the G domain of D . melanogaster dynamin identified a mutation within the GED C terminus 41 . The BSE is followed by a stalk , which is composed of helices from the middle domain and the N­terminal region of the GED 30 – 33 , and a PH domain 42 , which forms the vertex or ‘foot’ of the stalk hairpin and binds membranes . The PRD , which is expected to be unfolded , emerges at the boundary between the BSE and the G domain , most likely project­ ing away from the membrane , where it might interact with other proteins . Dimerization through the stalk . The stalk of dynamin dimerizes in a cross­like fashion ( FIG . 2a , b ) to yield a dynamin dimer in which the two G domains are oriented in opposite directions 30 – 33 ( FIG . 2b ) . This dimer is the basic dynamin unit and is different from the additional dimer­ ization interface that is generated by the interaction of two G domains ( FIG . 2b , c ) , which is discussed below . Phospholipid association through the PH domain . The PH domain binds acidic phospholipids in the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane , and phosphatidyl­ inositol­4 , 5­bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) in particular , via a positively charged surface at the foot of the dynamin hairpin 42 , 43 . PH­domain mutants that impair phospho­ inositide binding exert dominant­negative effects on clathrin­mediated endocytosis 44 , 45 . The binding between the isolated dynamin PH domain and phosphoinositides is of very modest affinity ( > 1 mM ) , but this membrane interaction is strengthened by charge­dependent asso­ ciation with other negatively charged phospholipids and by avidity afforded by dynamin polymerization 43 – 46 . A hydrophobic loop emerging from the PH domain may promote membrane interactions and may also have curvatur e­generatin g or ­sensing properties 28 , 47 . Coordinating dynamin function through the PRD . The PRD contains an array of PXXP amino acid motifs , which interact with many SH3 domain­containing proteins ( see Supplementary information S1 ( table ) ) to localize dynamin at endocytic sites and coordinate dynamin’s function with these other factors during endocytosis 48 – 51 . Accordingly , dynamin lacking the PRD cannot rescue endocytic defects in dynamin­knockout fibroblasts 19 . The PRD – SH3 interactions are typically of moderate affinity , but the presence of multiple SH3­binding motifs in the PRD and multiple SH3 domain­containing pro­ teins at endocytic sites , as well as the polymeric state of these proteins , results in a significant avidity effect , which enhances the ability of such interactions to concentrate dynamin . At least some interactions of the dynamin PRD are regulate d by phosphorylation 48 .

Adapted from : Ferguson and De Camilli ( 2012 ) . 2 . 1 Dynamin 7 templates which involve the interaction of G domains stimulates dynamin’s GTPase activity 1000 fold ( Stowell et al . , 1999 ) . The precise role of the GTPase activity by the G domains for dynamin - mediated ﬁssion is still highly debated ( Antonny et al . ( 2016 ) and next section , 2 . 1 . 4 ) , but there is consensus concerning the fact that GTP hydrolysis is required for ﬁssion to occur . Dynamin is able to induce membrane curvature via its polymerisation properties , as well in vivo where vesicle necks are wider when dynamin is absent from the neck ( Newton et al . , 2006 ; Shupliakov , 1997 ) , as in vitro ( Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ; Roux et al . , 2010 ) . Cryo - EM allowed to visualise the structures of dynamin polymers on membrane tubes ( Figure 2 . 5 ) together with the dimensions of the dynamin polymer and the underlying membrane tube . Diﬀerent geometries were obtained for diﬀerent nucleotide states and dynamin constructs . In the nucleotide - free state , the dynamin helix has an outer diameter of 50 nm with a helical pitch in the order of 10 – 20 nm and a membrane mid - plane diameter of 20 nm ( Takei et al . , 1998 ; Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ; Danino et al . , 2004 ; Chen et al . , 2004 ) . ∆ PRD - dynamin in the GMPPCP - bound polymer is in the constricted state with an inner membrane lumen of only 7 nm diameter ( Zhang and Hinshaw , 2001 ) . The number of dynamin dimers per helical turn is only slightly reduced from 14 to 13 . 2 dimers ( non - constricted and Dynamin is a GTP hydrolysis - dependent , membrane fission catalyzer The essential function of dynamin is to use energy from GTP hydro - lysis to sever membrane tubules . Fission of clathrin - coated pits from the plasma membrane is defective at neuronal synapses of mice lacking dynamin 1 , or both dynamins 1 and 3 ( Ferguson et al , 2007 ; Raimondi et al , 2011 ) and in embryonic fibroblasts from mice with conditional double ( Ferguson et al , 2009 ) or triple deletions of dynamin genes ( Park et al , 2013 ) . Mutants with reduced GTPase activity delay or block endocytosis of transferrin ( Marks et al , 2001 ; Boll et al , 2004 ; Song et al , 2004 ) and prolong the residence time of clathrin / dynamin at the plasma membrane ( Taylor et al , 2011 ; Kural et al , 2012 ) . GTPase - defective mutants have dominant nega - tive phenotypes when they co - assemble with wild - type proteins in overexpression experiments ( Damke et al , 1994 ) . The mechanism of dynamin - mediated membrane fission has been studied by reconstitution with purified components . GTP hydrolysis is consistently required for membrane fission in these reconstituted systems ( Sweitzer & Hinshaw , 1998 ; Roux et al , 2006 ; Bashkirov et al , 2008 ; Pucadyil & Schmid , 2008 ; Morlot et al , 2012 ; Shnyrova et al , 2013 ; Mattila et al , 2015 ) . Membrane tension , which can be provided by adhesion of the membrane tubes to the substrate , facilitates the reaction ( see also below ) ( Sweitzer & Hinshaw , 1998 ; Danino et al , 2004 ; Roux et al , 2006 ; Boulant et al , 2011 ; Morlot et al , 2012 ) . As in membrane fusion , dynamin - mediated fission proceeds through a hemi - fission state where the inner leaflet of the tube disappears ( see Fig 1B ) , leaving a connect - ing neck made of a single lipid monolayer wrapped in a cylindrical micelle ( Bashkirov et al , 2008 ; Morlot et al , 2012 ; Shnyrova et al , 2013 ; Mattila et al , 2015 ) .

( 2004 ) ; Zhang and Hinshaw ( 2001 ) ) . In the super - constricted state , the diameter of the inner membrane lumen is reduced to 3 . 7 nm ( Sundborger and Hinshaw , 2014 ) and dynamin forms a 2 - start helix . Such a 2 - start helix is possible when polymerisation is started by an octamer formed by two tetramers that interact via the G domains . 2 . 1 . 4 Mechanisms Of Dynamin - Mediated Membrane Fission Several ﬁssion models have been discussed in the past . Recently , the dynamin community reﬁned the current understanding to two models which agree best with the knowledge about dynamin - mediated ﬁssion at hand today . These two models are represented in Figure 2 . 6A and B . Both models agree that the ﬁrst step towards ﬁssion is the constriction of a nanotube by dynamin and that the hemiﬁssion state is an intermediate step . Hemiﬁssion has been suggested to be a ﬁssion - intermediate where the tube diameter is reduced so that lipids of the outer leaﬂet of one face of the tube directly interact with those of the other tube face ( for example Figure 2 . 6A , top row , third drawing from the left ; Kozlovsky and Kozlov ( 2003 ) ) . The inner leaﬂets of the tube are already seperated in this state . The hemiﬁssion state has been proposed in analogy to the ‘stalk intermediate’ of hemifusion ( Kozlovsky and Kozlov , 2002 ) . According to the disassembly model , GTP is not required for this step ( Figure 2 . 6A ) . GTP hydrolysis would lead to dissassembly of the dynamin polymer and ﬁssion would occur . The model proposes that the PH domain would destabilise the membrane in two ways , ﬁrstly by inserting an amphipathic loop deeper into the membrane ( wedging ; Mehrotra et al . ( 2014 ) ; Mattila et al . ( 2015 ) ) and secondly by tilting of the whole PH domain ( Figure 2 . 6A , right ) . The idea of the PH domain tilting would agree with the super - constricted dynamin helix ( K44A mutant ) where one out of two PH domains seemed to be tilted ( Shnyrova et al . , 2013 ; Sund - borger and Hinshaw , 2014 ) . Hemiﬁssion would occur following the tilting of the PH - domains ( Figure 2 . 6A ) . In contrast , GTP hydrolysis is an essential step for constriction according to the constric - tion / ratchet model ( in the following for simplicity referred to as constriction model ; Figure 2 . 6B ) . Dynamin would constrict the tube Roux et al . ( 2006 ) but again constriction is not considered suﬃcient to reach hemiﬁssion . Instead , ﬁssion is thought to occur spontaneously afterwards due to thermal ﬂuctuations of the membrane leaﬂets . According to this model , dynamin acts as a motor protein that uses the energy from GTP hydrolysis to decrease the energy barrier for spontaneous ﬁssion ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . Several cycles of subsequent GTP binding , G domain dimerisation of adjacent helix turns , GTP hydrolysis , conformational change and power stroke , followed by G domain dissociation and GDP release ( Morlot and Roux , 2013 ) are suggested in this model to cause a relative displacement of adjacent turns and constriction of the underlying membrane tube . The model of dynamin as a motor protein is supported by the low GTP aﬃnity but high GTPase rate , which resemble those of motor proteins instead of G proteins that have a high GTP aﬃnity but low hydrolysis rates ( Tuma and Collins , 1994 ; Warnock et al . , 1996 ) . The stochasticity of the occurrence of ﬁssion ( Morlot et al . ( 2012 ) , see also Figure 2E of Article 2 ) points to the idea that ﬁssion is a spontaneous event , much slower than GTP hydrolysis itself . 2 . 1 Dynamin 9 A THE DISASSEMBLY MODEL B THE CONSTRICTION / RATCHET MODEL Dynamin Constriction by assembly Constriction by torsion HEMIFISSION INDUCED BY PH DOMAIN BENDING Fission by disassembly Fission by spontaneous hemi - fission Membrane tube GTP HYDROLYSIS GTP HYDROLYSIS GTP HYDROLYSIS GTPasedomains BSE Stalks PH domains CONSTRICTION BY SLIDING OF THE TURNS ASSEMBLY HELIXCLOSURE GTPase domain dimerisation GTPase domain dissociation GTP hydrolysis power stroke SCISSION CONSTRICTION GTPasedomains BSE BSE S t a l k f il a m e n t s GTP GTP GDP GDP FAST ( few 100ms ) FAST ( few 100ms ) SLOW ( seconds ) SLOW ( seconds ) S GTPasdoma EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB Stalks mains Figure 3 .

( 2004 ) solved the structure of the BAR domain dimer of Drosophila amphiphysin ( Figure 2 . 7A – B ) with the aim to understand the basic mechanism of the known curvature generation properties of BAR domains , it became clear that the crescent - shaped structure of arfaptin 2 that Tarricone et al .

For the full - length protein , there is evidence of higher order oligomers at high concentrations ( Supplementary Figure 4A ) . This could be due to the previously proposed intramolecular interaction between the SH3 domain and the central proline - rich linker region ( Chen et al , 2003 ) . As the model for curvature sensing by BAR domains is binding via the concave face ( Peter et al , 2004 ) and the concave nature is only found in the dimeric form , it is surprising that the K D for dimerisation in solution is as high as 10 m M ( Figure 5A ) . Spin coupling between labelled site - directed cysteine mutants at position 227 was used to test if the dimer is the predominant form of the protein on mem - branes . K227 is located near the dimerisation interface , and the a - carbon distance between the two K227 residues in the crystal dimer is 8 A˚ ( see residue marked in Figure 3A ) . Introduction of a spin label at position 227 gave rise to a strong spin – spin interaction for this endophilin mutant and the resulting spectrum of the membrane - bound form exhib - ited strong dipolar broadening that is characteristic for spin labels in close proximity ( Figure 5C , red trace ) . This spectrum was very different from a control spectrum for the K227 derivative , in which the dipolar interaction was strongly reduced by co - mixing of 25 % labelled protein with 75 % unlabelled protein ( Figure 5C , black trace ) .

The endophilin N - BAR domain was decalciﬁed by puriﬁcation in the presence of 2 mM EDTA followed by incubation with 10 mM EDTA and then extensive dialysis against Ca - free buffer ( prepared using plastics ) . The absorbance of di - bromo BAPTA ( afﬁnity for Ca 2 þ of 2 m M in the absence of Mg 2 þ ) at 265 nm was followed on calcium titration in the presence and absence of decalciﬁed endophilin BAR domain . No difference was observed , suggesting that endophilin does not effectively compete with di - bromo BAPTA , even at double the concentration , for Ca 2 þ ions . ( G ) Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to test for heat changes on CaCl 2 injection into decalciﬁed endophilin N - BAR domain . These experiments were performed with 6 m l injections of 1 mM CaCl 2 into 45 m M full - length endophilin and 76 m M endophilin N - BAR domain at 10 or 25 1 C . Example results for the N - BAR domain are shown and no binding was observed . ( H ) Modelling of helix1 insert residues 62 – 79 as an a - helix .

The similarity was not noticed before due to very weak primary sequence homology . The BAR domain is a crescent - shaped homodimer . Each monomer is a coiled - coil of three long and kinked α - helices ( Figure 2 . 7A , C ; purple and green ( or yellow and blue ) designate the two monomers ) . BAR domains bind to negatively charged membranes via their positively charged concave face via electrostatic interactions ( Figure 2 . 7B ) . BAR domains preferentially bind to curved membranes ( curvature sensing module ) and induce curvature ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Gallop et al . , 2006 ; Masuda et al . , 2006 ; Antonny , 2011 ; Sorre et al . , 2012 ; Prévost et al . , 2015 ) . Figure 2 . 8 shows the subgroups of the BAR domain superfamily with representative structures and the concrete members of each subgroup . The subgroups are caracterised by diﬀerent curvatures of the crescent and the existence of extra features or domains such as an additional N - terminal amphipathic helix ( N - BAR proteins ) , a PH domain ( BAR - PH proteins ) or a PX domain ( PX - BAR proteins ) . While F - BAR ( standing for FCH and BAR , Itoh et al . ( 2005 ) ) domains are less curved than the classical BAR and N - BAR domains , I - BAR ( inverted BAR ) domains have a curvature in the opposite direction and indeed preferentially bind to and induce negative curvature ( Millard et al . , 2005 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ; Lee et al . , 2007 ; Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ; Prévost et al . , 2015 ) . The structure of a BAR protein coat around membrane tubes was solved for F - BAR proteins ( Frost et al . , 2008 ) , endophilin ( Mim and Unger , 2012 ) and BIN1 / amphiphysin 2 ( Adam et al . , 2015 ) . F - BAR coats on tubes have in general a bigger diameter than N - BAR coats on tubes ( ∼ 30 nm vs . ∼ 50 - 90 nm diameter ; Itoh et al . ( 2005 ) ; Tsujita et al . ( 2006 ) ; Frost et al . ( 2008 ) ; Mim and Unger ( 2012 ) ; Adam et al . ( 2015 ) ) . The structure of the F - BAR domain dimer ( Shimada et al . , 2007 ) conﬁrmed the 192 Cell 137 , April 17 , 2009 ©2009 Elsevier Inc . can be used in a variety of contexts for dif - ferent functions ( Frost et al . , 2007 ; Table 1 ) . For example , the presence of fl anking phosphoinositide binding motifs ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) or phox ( PX ) or pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domains can help to direct BAR pro - teins to membranes enriched in cognate phosphoinositides . Alternatively , in endo - philin and amphiphysin , BAR domains are conjoined with N - terminal sequences of ~ 26 residues that appear to fold into amphipathic α helices ( so - called N - BAR domains ) in the local environment of the bilayer polar - apolar interface . The inter - calation of this helix into one leafl et of the bilayer may act like a “wedge” that causes local buckling when the polar headgroups of one lipid monolayer are pushed apart , or like an “anchor” that reduces the k off for membrane binding ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Gallop et al . , 2006 ) . Though the sequence of events has not yet been determined , helix insertion may facilitate subsequent binding of the BAR module to enhance or further stabilize curvature . Unexpect - edly , in some BAR domains a convex sur - face ( rather than a concave surface ) is the bilayer - binding interface . These “Inverse” or I - BAR domains promote inverse tubu - lation or the generation of fi lopodia - like extensions ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ) . Linking Membranes with the Cytoskeleton Several members of the BAR domain superfamily provide a link between the membrane and the membrane - asso - ciated cytoskeleton . The nucleation of actin fi laments at the plasma membrane generates mechanical forces that drive migrating cells , cell division , protrusions or invaginations of the membrane , the internalization of vesicles during endo - cytosis , and the “rocketing” of intracel - lular vesicles . F - actin polymerization is triggered by Rho - family GTPases and by the lipids PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , in coordination with nucleating factors such as the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and the Wiskott - Aldrich verpro - lin ( WAVE ) protein ( Takenawa and Suet - sugu , 2007 ) . Many BAR domain proteins are linked to actin nucleation by multiple mechanisms and may coordinate this process with membrane remodeling events . For example , some BAR proteins bind to and help to activate WASP / WAVE proteins . Furthermore , as these BAR proteins form dimers , they functionally dimerize the verprolin - cofi lin - acidic ( VCA ) domains at the C termini of WASP / WAVE proteins . Dimerization of WASP / WAVE VCA domains appears to be a potent means of activating the Arp2 / 3 complex , which is involved in actin nucleation ( Padrick et al . , 2008 ) . In addition , some BAR proteins act as effectors or regula - tors of Rho - family GTPases : they recruit the phosphoinositide phosphatase Synaptojanin , which regulates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , and dynamin , whose role in membrane fi ssion is intercon - nected with actin dynamics ( Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . Other BAR proteins bind to and “bundle” actin fi bers directly ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . A striking case of this multifunctionality is the protein Tuba ( also called dynamin - binding protein ) , which has four N - terminal SH3 domains , a DH domain , a BAR domain , and two C - terminal SH3 domains . The four N - ter - minal SH3 domains have strong avidity for dynamin , the DH domain is a Cdc42 GEF , and the C - terminal SH3 domains bind directly to N - WASP and Ena / VASP proteins ( Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ) . Regulation by GTPases The physical and functional relation to small GTPases , which together with phosphoinositides recruit cytosolic proteins to membrane compartments , seems to be important for the functions of BAR domain proteins . These GTPases coordinate interactions between BAR proteins , their target membranes , a variety of effector proteins , and actin fi laments ( Habermann , 2004 ) . BAR domain proteins known to interact with small GTPases include arfaptin ( an effector of Arf and a ligand for Rac ) ( Tarricone et al . , 2001 ) ; IRSp53 ( a Rac effector implicated in fi lopodia forma - tion ) ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) ; Toca - 1 , Toca - 2 / FBP17 , and Toca - 3 / CIP4 ( SH3 - depen - dent WASP and dynamin recruitment plus HR1 - dependent Cdc42 binding ) ( Ho et al . , 2004 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ) ; APPL , a Rab5 / 21 effector that participates in growth factor receptor traffi cking and signaling ( Miaczynska et al . , 2004 ) ; and nervous wreck , a synaptic protein that cooperates with Cdc42 on Rab11 - Table 1 .

Each BAR domain is oriented in the scheme so that the membrane interaction face points downwards . Adapted from Frost et al . ( 2009 ) . 12 Molecular Regulation Of Dynamin - Mediated Membrane Fission earlier hypothesis of Peter et al . ( 2004 ) that the crescent shape of BAR domains contributes to their curvature inducing properties . The more gently curved shape of the F - BAR domain dimer ( Shimada et al . , 2007 ) was , in agreement with this hypothesis , indeed inducing less membrane curvature than N - BAR proteins ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ; Frost et al . , 2008 ) . The orientation of the BAR domains in these coats has been observed to be diﬀerent , depending on the protein . While F - BAR domains and the N - BAR domain from endophilin bound to the membrane in a symmetric way , where both ends of the crescent have the same distance to the axis of the membrane tube , the N - BAR domain of BIN1 / amphiphysin 2 was tilted and one of the tips of the crescent inserted deep into the bilayer ( Adam et al . , 2015 ) . In the case of N - BAR proteins , the amphipathic helices of neighbouring dimers are proposed to laterally interact in the scaﬀold , as resolved by electron microscopy ( Mim and Unger , 2012 ; Adam et al . , 2015 ) . Diﬀerent further experiments and molecular simulations suggested , on the other hand , that amphipathic helices are dispensable for scaﬀold formation ( Simunovic et al . , 2016 ; Chen et al . , 2016 ) . Once the structure of the general BAR domain solved , BAR domains were found in many diﬀerent proteins ( Habermann , 2004 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ) . Several of these were found to be involved in membrane dynamics such as endocytosis ( Salazar et al . , 2003 ; Soulet et al . , 2005 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ) and actin dynamics ( Munn et al . , 1995 ; Habermann , 2004 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ; Ho et al . , 2004 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Lee et al . , 2010 ) . The F - BAR protein Toca - 1 ( transducer of Cdc42 - dependent actin assembly ) for example can directly and simultaneously interact with Cdc42 ( cell division control protein 42 homolog ) and N - WASP ( neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ) ( Ho et al . , 2004 ) , which in turn activates the actin nucleation properties of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Ma et al . , 1998 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2002 ; Lee et al . , 2010 ) . FBP17 ( formin - binding protein 17 / formin - binding protein 1 ( FNBP1 ) ) , another F - BAR protein , also localises to sites of actin nucleation ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) . Overexpressing FBP17 was found to impair clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) . This protein , like several BAR proteins , tubulates the cell membrane when overexpressed in mammalian cells ( Kamioka et al . , 2004 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ; Nicot et al . , 2007 ) . Overexpressing dynamin rescued the tubulating phenotype , but only as long as actin polymerisation was not disrupted , and disrupting actin alone was suﬃcient to induce tubulation by FBP15 ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) , indicating that actin and dynamin counteracted FBP15 - induced plasma membrane tubulation in non - transfected cells . Taken together , many F - BAR proteins are considered as linkers between membrane curvature on the one hand ( via curvature sensing and induction of the F - BAR domain ) and the actin regulatory network on the other hand . Actin itself was shown to be absolutely required for clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) in yeast and also to play a role in CME in mammalian cells ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Merriﬁeld et al . , 2002 , 2005 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ; Galletta et al . , 2010 ) . 2 . 2 . 2 Amphiphysin , Endophilin And Dynamin Many BAR proteins have an SH3 domain which speciﬁcally interacts with PRD domain con - taining proteins such as dynamin . The SH3 domains of endophilin and amphiphysin are known to physically interact with the proline - rich domain ( PRD ) of dynamin ( Grabs et al . , 1997 ; Ringstad et al . , 1997 ) . As we have seen in the previous section ( Section 2 . 1 ) , dynamin me - diates membrane ﬁssion at vesicle necks .

Furthermore , live imaging of cells expressing fluorescent dynamin shows that dynamin lev­ els at the pits are low during early stages of clathrin­coated pit maturation ( FIG . 3 ) , most likely reflecting low­affinity interactions with other endocytic factors , and rise mark­ edly during later stages — reflecting polymerization at the bud neck — to reach a peak that coincides with mem­ brane fission 67 , 80 , 82 ( FIG . 3b ) . Factors that cooperatively , but redundantly , regulate dynamin assembly here include : PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and other acidic phospholipids present in the plasma membrane 83 , 84 ; the tubular membrane tem­ plate at the bud neck 53 ; proteins containing dynamin­ binding SH3 domains ( primarily BAR domain­containing proteins 72 , 73 , whose polymerization forms a powerful high­avidity affinity matrix 71 ; see Supplementary infor­ mation S1 ( table ) ) ; and actin , which can directly bind dynamin 85 ( FIG . 3 ) . The coinciding accumulation of BAR proteins , actin and dynamin at late stages of endocyto­ sis 67 , 80 , which is consistent with feed­forward mechanisms , is particularly striking ( FIG . 3b ) . The sequence of events underlying clathrin­mediated endocytosis is evolutionarily conserved , as this process shows mechanistic similarity to endocytosis at actin patches in yeast 86 , 87 . Surprisingly , however , there are mixed reports as to whether the closest yeast homologue of dynamin , vacuolar protein sorting­associated 1 ( Vps1 ) , does 88 , 89 or does not 86 , 90 participate in actin patch endo­ cytosis , questioning how essential dynamin is for clathrin­ mediated endocytosis . It is possible that unique properties of the yeast plasma membrane , for example tension and / or the presence of a cell wall , explain this difference 91 . Dynamin in other endocytic pathways Endocytosis can also occur without clathrin , and dynamin has been implicated in some clathrin­independent endo­ cytic pathways ( FIG . 1 ) . For example , a role for dynamin in caveolin­dependent internalization has been sug­ gested , and both dynamin and actin were transiently detected at caveolae , coincident with their fission from the plasma membrane 92 , 93 . However , the dynamics and function of dynamin at caveolae remain largely undefined . Surprisingly , the absence of dynamin is accompanied by a loss of caveolae and of their core component caveolin 1 , rather than by the increase in caveolae abundance that might be expected if dynamin were required for their fis­ sion 19 . Thus , it is not yet clear whether dynamin has a key role during the endocytic fission of caveolae . With respect to clathrin­ and caveolin­independent endocytic pathways , evidence for a role of dynamin is , in many cases , primarily dependent on approaches using dominant­negative mutants ( which may exert indirect effects ) or pharmacological inhibition with drugs ( which may have off­target or non­physiological effects ; see Supplementary information S2 ( box ) ) . Thus , definitive answers as to how dynamin affects such pathways will require a combination of methods and should include loss­of­function studies . As robust bulk endocytosis still occurs in fibroblasts lacking dynamin 19 and in the pres­ ence of dominant­negative dynamin mutants 12 , dynamin cannot have a universal role in endocytic vesicle fission . Roles in intracellular budding Vesicle budding , and thus membrane fission , occurs at multiple points throughout the secretory and endocytic pathways . Although dynamin does not affect most of these events , several experimental approaches have sug­ gested that it might contribute to the fission of clathrin­ coated vesicles that bud from the trans ­Golgi network ( TGN ) 94 , as well as of other vesicles that bud from either the Golgi complex or endosomes 20 , 95 – 97 . The yeast dynamin homologue Vps1 has also been implicated in retrograde traffic between endosomes and the Golgi complex 98 . However , there was no obvious accumulation of clathrin­ coated pits at the TGN of fibroblasts lacking dynamin 19 , suggesting that dynamin is not universally required for Figure 3 | Dynamin and clathrin - mediated endocytosis . a | The putative sequence of events in the action of clathrin adaptors , actin , Bin – amphiphysin – Rvs ( BAR ) domain - containing proteins and dynamin at clathrin - coated endocytic pits , as revealed by studies of cells that lack dynamin ( dynamin 1 and dynamin 2 double - knockout fibroblasts ) 19 . Lack of dynamin results in an arrest of the endocytic reaction at the stage of deeply invaginated pits and in the actin - dependent elongation of their BAR domain - containing protein - coated tubular necks ( lower - right electron microscopy ( EM ) micrograph ) . When actin is depolymerized ( for example , through latrunculin B treatment ) , clathrin - coated buds collapse to Ω - shaped pits with short , wide necks ( upper - left EM micrograph ) . The fluorescence micrograph shows tubulated endocytic clathrin - coated pits in dynamin 1 and dynamin 2 double - knockout fibroblasts , as revealed by live - cell imaging of the BAR domain - containing protein endophilin 2 , which was labelled with green fluorescent protein ( tubular neck ) , and of clathrin light chain , which was labelled with red fluorescent protein . b | Schematic timeline showing the accumulation of endocytic proteins at endocytic pits .

All rights reserved Figure 2 . 9 : Appearance of endophilin and amphiphysin at the pit neck together with dynamin just before ﬁssion . Adapted from Ferguson and De Camilli ( 2012 ) . proteins in membrane ﬁssion arose from the observation that the N - BAR proteins amphiphysin and endophilin massively accumulate at the neck of the pit just before ﬁssion , like dynamin ( Figure 2 . 9 ; Taylor et al . ( 2011 ) ; Ferguson and De Camilli ( 2012 ) ) . The same was observed for yeast amphiphysin Rvs167p ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . N - BAR pro - teins are characterised by their additional N - terminal amphipathic helix . Amphipathic helices are sequences of 15 – 30 amino acids in which the hydrophilic residues are positioned on one and the hydrophobic residues on the other face , once folded into an α - helix ( Segrest et al . , 1974 ) . While being unfolded in solution , they fold into an α helix when binding to lipids in a membrane ( velcro model ; Mesmin et al . ( 2007 ) ; Antonny ( 2011 ) ) . Amphipathic helices are considered as curvature - inducing modules based on the ﬁndings that constructs with mutations in the amphipathic helix have reduced membrane binding and curvature inducing properties ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ) . Amphipathic helices have also been proposed to sense curvature and other intra - molecular stresses ( Campelo and Kozlov , 2014 ) . Boucrot et al . ( 2012 ) have pro - posed that amphipathic helices are able to constrict membrane tubes and induce membrane ﬁssion , in contrast to the BAR domain itself , which is proposed to behave like a scaﬀold that prevents further constriction below the intrinsic curvature of the respective BAR domain and therefore prevents ﬁssion . The case of N - BAR proteins is , in this view , particularly interesting because they have both , the amphipathic helix and the scaﬀolding BAR domain . Simunovic et al . ( 2016 ) and Chen et al . ( 2016 ) recently observed that amphipathic helices indeed are not required for scaﬀold formation by N - BAR proteins . In simulations in contrast , the amphipathic helices seem to be involved in curvature sensing when the curvature is high ( tubes below 80 nm of diameter ) . BAR proteins assemble together with dynamin on membrane tubes . Strinkingly , N - BAR domain coated membrane tubes and dynamin - coated membrane tubes are similar in size ( Takei et al . , 1999 ; Farsad et al . , 2001 ) . When both dynamin and the N - BAR protein are co - assembled on membrane tubes , the pitch of the dynamin helix is increased roughly by a factor of 2 ( Takei et al . , 1999 ; Farsad et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , the dynamin pitch on elongated , blocked vesicle necks in vivo is also increased ( Iversen et al . , 2003 ; Takei et al . , 1998 , 1995 ) . The role of N - BAR domains on dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion is still unclear . Am - phiphysin was initially suggested to activate dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion ( Takei et al . , 1999 ) , and this eﬀect was found to be curvature dependent in the following ( Yoshida et al . , 14 Molecular Regulation Of Dynamin - Mediated Membrane Fission 2004 ) . Endophilin was ﬁrst shown to inhibit dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ) , but was later also observed to activate ﬁssion ( Meinecke et al . , 2013 ; Neumann and Schmid , 2013 ) . The GTPase activity of dynamin was in some cases inhibited by the N - BAR protein , while ﬁssion was activated ( Neumann and Schmid , 2013 ) . The eﬀect of N - BAR pro - teins on dynamin - mediated ﬁssion is therefore not clear . The goal of this thesis work was to clarify this ( see Chapter 4 ) . Interestingly , endophilin A2 – the ubiquitous variant of the three endophilin A proteins in mam - mals – has recently been found to mediate a clathrin - independent pathway at the leading edges of mammalian cells ( Boucrot et al . , 2015 ) . At the leading edges , phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) is dephosphorylated to phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ) . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 recruits lamellipodin which in turn engages endophilin A2 . The new pathway is called fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME , Boucrot et al . ( 2015 ) ) . Con - stantly pulling at rates of ∼ 0 . 5 µ m / sec on a nanotube in an in vitro assay ( nanotube pulling assay , see Section 3 . 2 ) that is covered with endophilin A2 was observed to induce membrane scission ( Renard et al . , 2015 ) in 80 % of the cases . The authors propose that scission occured due to the interaction between the endophilin scaﬀold and the membrane which limited the ﬂow of lipids below the scaﬀold , leading to increased membrane tension . The increased tension would reduce the radius of the tube till reaching the hemiﬁssion state ( see Section 2 . 1 . 4 ) and then ﬁssion ( Renard et al . , 2015 ) . In the cell , microtubule - based molecular motors , which are known to be able to move at speeds similar to the one applied in the in vitro experiment , could induce the pulling force required for ﬁssion ( Renard et al . , 2015 ) . 2 . 3 Dynamin And The N - BAR Protein BIN1 / Amphiphysin 2 In A Muscle Disease 2 . 3 . 1 Introduction To Article 1 In the previous chapter , I have discussed the ﬁssion properties of the GTPase dynamin and the curvature sensing and inducing properties of BAR proteins . A decade ago , linkage analysis and sequencing of candidate genes with DNA from patients with centronuclear myopathy ( CNM ) led to the discovery of mutations in dynamin 2 and BIN1 / amphiphysin 2 which segregated with the disease ( Bitoun et al . , 2005 ; Nicot et al . , 2007 ) . CNM is a muscular atrophy with variable onset , severity and progressiveness and the common histological feature is that the cell nuclei are abnormally localised to the center of the muscle cells instead of being located to the periphery , close to the cell membrane . An X - linked form of CNM was already known when the dynamin 2 and BIN1 mutations were found , but the disease of the new set of patients did not segregate in an X - linked manner and the patients did not have mutations in the MTM1 ( myotubularin ) gene which is mutated in the X - linked form of CNM . Myotubularin is a lipid phosphatase and involved in intracellular traﬃcking . After having identiﬁed an 11 Mb region on chromosome 19 by genome - wide linkage analysis , the dynamin 2 gene ( DNM2 ) was selected for sequencing due to its expression in skeletal mus - cle , membrane traﬃcking ( like MTM1 ) and indirect involvement in the cytoskeleton . Indeed , several CNM mutations in the dynamin 2 gene were identiﬁed ( Bitoun et al . , 2005 ) . BIN1 was sequenced in another set of CNM patients with recessive segregation that had neither 2 . 3 Dynamin And The N - BAR Protein BIN1 / Amphiphysin 2 In A Muscle Disease 15 mutations in MTM1 nor DNM2 ( Nicot et al . , 2007 ) . The strategy of this group was also to sequence genes of proteins whose functions are linked with the one of myotubularin . BIN1 was a good candidate because of its known role in the muscle ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) and its membrane remodelling properties , linking it with MTM1 - CNM where T - tubules are altered ( Mandel et al . , 2002 ) . The review “Structural insights into the centronuclear myopathy - associated functions of BIN1 and dynamin 2” ( Hohendahl et al . , 2016 ) , in which I was mainly responsable for the BIN1 part , had two major purposes : 1 . To discuss how mutations in two ubiquitous proteins involved in endocytosis , dynamin and amphiphysin , and which on top physically interact with each other , can lead to muscle - speciﬁc phenotypes , without aﬀecting endocytosis 2 . To draw conclusions from the studies with CNM BIN1 and dynamin 2 mutants on the properties of wild type BIN1 and dynamin 2 A summary of the review is presented in Section 2 . 3 . 3 . 2 . 3 . 2 Article 1 : Structual insights into the centronuclear myopathy - associated functions of BIN1 and dynamin 2 Article published on October 1 st , 2016 in Journal of Structural Biology , Volume 196 , Issue 1 , pages 37 – 47 .

Recent human genetic studies have isolated several groups of muta - tions . Among them , many are found in two interacting proteins essential to clathrin - mediated endocytosis , dynamin and the BIN - Amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) protein BIN1 / amphiphysin 2 . In this review , by using structural and functional data from the study of endocytosis mainly , we discuss how the CNM mutations could affect the structure and the function of these ubiquitous proteins and cause the muscle - speciﬁc phenotype . The literature shows that both proteins are involved in the plasma membrane tubu - lation required for T - tubule biogenesis . However , this system also requires the regulation of the dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion , and the formation of a stable protein - scaffold to maintain the T - tubule structure . We discuss how the speciﬁc functions , isoforms and partners ( myotubularin in partic - ular ) of these two proteins can lead to the establishment of muscle - speciﬁc features .

Introduction Muscles are essential to animal life . Among the different types of muscles , skeletal muscles are involved in coordinated move - ment , such as walk . Brain neuronal inﬂux orchestrates the contrac - tion and relaxation cycles of the many muscles involved in a speciﬁc move . The importance of the correct transduction of such signals within muscle cells is revealed in human diseases where it is impaired . One of these is a group of hereditary diseases with several genetic determinants called centronuclear myopathies ( CNMs ) . The onset , severity and progressiveness vary a lot between different CNM subtypes , but the common symptoms are muscle weakness and the histological phenotype that cell nuclei are abnormally located in the centre of the muscle ﬁbres instead of at the periphery , just below the plasma membrane , giving its name to the disease . This histological phenotype may be a signature of muscle ﬁbres not being fully differentiated . Central nuclei are pre - sent in many forms of myopathies , as a consequence of excessive muscle ﬁbre regeneration , due to ﬁbre loss . However , in CNM , no excessive regeneration occurs , and the central position of nuclei is thought to arise from a block in muscle ﬁbre development . How - ever , it could also be that the mutation interferes with the process that locates the nuclei at the periphery , without affecting the mus - cle functionality . Almost a decade ago , the ﬁrst cases of CNM patients with a mutation in the BAR domain ( Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ) protein BIN1 and in dynamin 2 were reported ( Bitoun et al . , 2005 ; Nicot et al . , 2007 ) . These proteins are ubiquitously expressed and impor - tant players of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , where they have a membrane remodelling activity . The aim of this review is to describe how the properties and functions of these proteins discov - ered in endocytosis can help in understanding the muscle - speciﬁc function of these proteins , and how mutations causing CNM would trigger the symptoms . 2 . BIN1 in CNM 2 . 1 . BIN1 , a crescent - shaped protein able to tubulate membranes BIN1 , a close homologue of the endocytic protein amphiphysin 1 ( 54 % identity ) and therefore also called amphiphysin 2 , was initially identiﬁed as the box - dependent myc - interacting protein http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . jsb . 2016 . 06 . 015 1047 - 8477 / (cid:1) 2016 The Authors .

Quickly after its discovery , it was observed to be located in the proximity of T - tubules in skeletal muscles ( Butler et al . , 1997 ) . T - tubules are long tubular invaginations from the myocyte plasma membrane into the actin ﬁbre organization . They are parallel to the Z - lines of sar - comeres and allow the propagation of the myocyte plasma mem - brane depolarisation , triggered by the neuronal action potential . Once in the T - tubules , the depolarization induces the release of cal - cium from sarcoplasmic membranes adjacent to T - tubules . The cal - cium further induces myosin activity , and muscle contraction . BIN1 was ﬁrst proposed to play a role in muscle cell differenti - ation based on the results that myoblasts had difﬁculties to differ - entiate into myotubes when BIN1 was downregulated ( Wechsler - Reya et al . , 1998 ) . But it was intriguing to ﬁnd such similarities between amphiphysin 1 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) and BIN1 in the T - tubule system . In Drosophila , the single amphi - physin gene accounts for both the endocytic function of human amphiphysin 1 and the muscular function of BIN1 , as it is located at both endocytic pits and in the proximity of tubular structures resembling T - tubules in ﬂies ( Razzaq et al . , 2001 ) . Strikingly , the homozygous null mutant was viable and did not have a signiﬁcant phenotype in endocytosis of synaptic vesicles , but had a severe phenotype in the muscle contraction and was therefore ﬂightless . Confocal sections revealed that the T - tubule system was present but highly disorganised in the ﬂy muscle , suggesting that the Dro - sophila amphiphysin / BIN1 homolog participates to the T - tubule biogenesis . BIN1 belongs to the BAR protein family ( BIN1 / Amphiphysin / Rvs167 ; Sakamuro et al . , 1996 ) , a protein family which shares the BAR domain . The BAR domain is the lipid membrane binding domain , and forms dimers of the shape of a crescent ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . The BAR domain dimer binds to negatively charged lipids via its positively charged concave face ( Casal et al . , 2006 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ) . Because of its crescent shape , it was shown to bind membranes in a curvature - dependent manner , and is thus consid - ered as a membrane - curvature sensing module ( Antonny , 2011 ) . BIN1 further belongs to the subclass of N - BAR proteins as it also contains an N - terminal amphipathic helix . Amphipathic helices are sequences of 15 – 30 amino acids in which , once folded into an a - helix , the hydrophobic residues are positioned on one face and the hydrophilic residues on the opposite face of the helix ( see also Fig . 2A ; Segrest et al . , 1974 ) . They are unfolded in solution and fold into an a - helix while binding to the lipids ( velcro model , Antonny , 2011 ) . Point mutations of hydrophobic residues within the amphipathic helices strongly affect liposome binding and tubu - lation of the two N - BAR proteins endophilin and amphiphysin 1 ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , these amphipathic helices are often con - sidered as curvature - inducer modules . But amphipathic helices are also proposed to sense curvature and other intra - membrane stres - ses ( Campelo and Kozlov , 2014 ) as well as to be involved in mem - brane ﬁssion ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ) . The structure of BIN1’s N - terminal amphipathic helix in micelles was solved by NMR by Löw et al . ( 2008 ) and shows that roughly 20 residues belong to BIN1’s N - terminal amphipathic helix . Thus , the BAR domain of BIN1 has structural features , like other N - BAR domains , with cur - vature sensing , and curvature - inducing capabilities . As it was shown that the balance between those two activities strongly depends on the BAR domain density on the membrane ( Sorre et al . , 2012 ) , one can wonder whether the BAR domain of BIN1 is a curvature sensor or a curvature inducer in the physiological con - text of the T - tubule biogenesis . Another domain present in all BIN1 isoforms is an Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain which interacts with several Proline - Rich Domains ( PRDs ) , including the one of dynamin ( Grabs et al . , 1997 ) , another protein mutated in several CNM - patients ( see next part ) . This domain is thus expected to play a major role in the combined action of BIN1 and dynamin in T - tubule biogenesis ( see second part ) . BIN1 has two muscle - speciﬁc isoforms ( including vs . excluding exon 17 ) , which contain peptide sequences with muscle - speciﬁc properties . BIN1 has 20 exons , which are differentially spliced into 11 isoforms ( Uniprot ID O00499 , UGID 160989 ; Fig . 1 ) . BIN1 amino acid numbers refer to the position in the canonical isoform 1 in this review . In these muscle - speciﬁc isoforms , the clathrin - AP2 ( CLAP ) binding motif , which targets BIN1 to clathrin - coated pits , is not present , arguing for a role independent of CME in the muscle ( Ramjaun and McPherson , 1998 ) . Moreover , only the muscle speci - ﬁc isoforms of BIN1 , sometimes referred to as M - Amph2 , contain translated exon 11 . Exon 11 was found to speciﬁcally bind to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 4 ) P ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) and therefore named phospho - inositide ( PI ) domain . It should be noted that exon 11 was previ - ously named exon 10 ( e . g . Lee et al . , 2002 ; Wechsler - Reya et al . , 1997 ) because an additional exon in the BAR domain had been overlooked ( current name exon 7 ( NCBI ) , exon a – b from Tsutsui et al . , 1997 ) . The overexpression of BIN1 isoform 8 , which contains the PI motif , was found to induce membrane tubulation in several cell types ( Nicot et al . , 2007 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ) , while this was not observed for the neuronal isoform 1 which does not contain the PI motif . This led to the proposition that the PI motif is required for the tubulation activity of BIN1 , suggesting a role in the formation of T - tubules . Lee et al . ( 2002 ) proposed that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , whose concentration increases during myoblast - to - myotube Fig . 1 . BIN1 and dynamin 2 domain structure . BIN1 , upper panel . Dynamin 2 , lower panel .

Hohendahl et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 196 ( 2016 ) 37 – 47 differentiation and is enriched in T - tubules , recruits BIN1 to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich plasma membrane compartments , leading to membrane tubulation and T - tubule formation . The afﬁnities for the different phosphoinositides PI ( 3 ) P , PI ( 4 ) P , PI ( 5 ) P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is still a mat - ter of debate ( Fugier et al . , 2011 ; Picas et al . , 2014 ) , but the PI motif of BIN1 is needed for correct muscle function and localisation of BIN1 in the muscle ( Böhm et al . , 2013 ) . The role of the PI motif would thus be to locally increase BIN1 protein density onto the membrane in a PIP - dependent manner , promoting curvature induction towards curvature - sensing functions , as shown by Sorre et al . ( 2012 ) for amphiphysin 1 . In this case , BIN1 would actively participate in the tubulation of the plasma membrane into a T - tubule system . This scenario is consistent with the fact that the T - tubule system is disrupted in patients with mutations within the PI motif ( see below ) . The PI motif was not only found to bind to phosphoinositides but also to the BIN1 SH3 domain ( Kojima et al . , 2004 ) . Exchanging the PI motif in BIN1 by a different phosphoinositide binding domain without afﬁnity for SH3 domains ( PH domain of PLC d ) resulted in abnormal morphology of nascent T - tubules ( Kojima et al . , 2004 ) . This result could be explained by competitive interac - tions between PIPs , PI , SH3 and dynamin PRD domains . Wu and Baumgart ( 2014 ) determined binding afﬁnities for these different interactions and came to the conclusion that the afﬁnity of the SH3 domain is higher for its own PI motif than for dynamin’s PRD domain ( K d 10 l M and 66 l M , respectively ) . They also found that the K d of the PI motif for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was too high to be measured by isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) , but high PRD domain concentrations increased BIN1 membrane binding , suggesting that the SH3 domain is released from the PI motif when the SH3 domain Fig . 2 .

Moreover , the K d val - ues for full - length BIN1 binding to PIPs are very low ( all below 2 l M ; Fugier et al . , 2011 ) , making it the strongest interaction of all three . Thus a possible scenario could be that the phosphoinosi - tide binding of the full - length BIN1 would cause the release of the SH3 / PI domain interaction , allowing the SH3 domain to bind to dynamin’s PRD domain , and recruiting dynamin to T - tubules ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) . All these domains have mutations causing various forms of CNM . In the following , we review these mutations , and try to pinpoint the speciﬁc function disabled in each of these , and discuss the role of BIN1 in the speciﬁc context of the muscle . 2 . 2 . BIN1 mutations found in CNM patients Based on the observation that the Drosophila Amphiphysin / BIN1 null mutant led to a disorganised T - tubule system , Razzaq et al . ( 2001 ) proposed that BIN1 mutations might be responsible for myopathies . In 2007 , such mutations were indeed reported ( Nicot et al . , 2007 ) . The authors analysed a group of CNM patients with consanguineous parents , therefore potentially having homozygous mutations . The MTM1 gene , coding for myotubularin , a lipid phosphatase involved in the production of a precursor of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and already shown to cause CNM when mutated , was not mutated in those patients . The authors sequenced BIN1 due to the known link of BIN1 with muscles and PIPs and identiﬁed three mutations that were segregating , when homozygous , with the CNM symptoms . Since then , seven further BIN1 mutations were identiﬁed ( Böhm et al . , 2010 , 2013 , 2014 ; Claeys et al . , 2010 ) , out of which four caused a mild version of CNM already when heterozygous , leading to ten currently known CNM - linked BIN1 mutations ( see Table 1 ) . The mutations locate to the BAR domain , its N - terminal amphi - pathic helix , the PI motif and the C - terminal SH3 domain ( see Fig . 1 ) . Mutations in the PI motif are expected to have a muscle - speciﬁc phenotype , since only muscle isoforms of BIN1 contain this domain . But it is interesting to note that most of the found CNM - linked mutations affect the N - BAR and SH3 domains that are pre - sent in all isoforms of BIN1 , leading to the question of how such mutations could lead to a muscle - speciﬁc disease . 2 . 3 . CNM - linked mutations in the N - terminal amphipathic helix of BIN1 could decrease the stability of the BIN1 scaffold In the following , we are going through the different BIN1 muta - tions in more detail . Three mutations ( D K21 , R24C , K35N ; Böhm et al . , 2014 ; Nicot et al . , 2007 ) locate to the amphipathic helix at the N - terminus of the BAR domain of BIN1 . In the R24C and K35N mutations , positively charged residues are replaced by hydrophobic or polar uncharged residues . In the D K21 mutation , three nucleotides are deleted , leading to a deletion of positively charged lysine 21 without frame shift and a shift in the amino acid sequence on the helical wheel ( see Fig . 2A ) . When K21 is absent , the original lysine at this helical wheel position should be unaf - fected because lysine 20 will likely take over this position . In con - trast , the polar uncharged amino acid Q19 should take over the position of the charged K20 , meaning that this should be the actu - ally affected helical wheel position of the D K21 deletion . The three residues affected by the above mutations are all in the polar face of the helical wheel and very close to each other . These mutations are thus expected to strongly interfere with the struc - ture of the amphipathic helix ( see Fig . 2A ) , and thus with its ability to bind and cause membrane curvature . In the three mutations found in the amphipathic helix of BIN1 , positively charged amino acid positions in the wheel projection are replaced by uncharged amino acids , while the hydrophobic face of the helical wheel remains almost unaffected . This underlines the importance of the positively charged residues 20 , 24 and 35 , which interact with neg - atively charged lipids of the plasma membrane to trigger proper helix folding into the membrane ( Antonny , 2011 ) . For these three mutations , BIN1’s tubulating activity upon over - expression was decreased in cells ( Böhm et al . , 2014 ; Nicot et al . , 2007 ; Wu et al . , 2014 ) . No in vitro tubulation data were available for the D K21 and R24C mutants but one study tested the K35N mutant’s tubulating activity in vitro and did not observe signiﬁcant differences to the WT ( Wu et al . , 2014 ) . However , they observed decreased membrane binding of the K35N BIN1 N - BAR compared to WT . One might speculate that the K35N mutant has a defect in membrane tubulation because of reduced membrane binding , but in vitro , where high protein concentrations are used , the membrane is probably saturated with protein regardless of its binding efﬁciency . Consistently , D K21 and R24C cause CNM already in the heterozygous state , while K35N only when homozy - gous . The reduced tubulation activity of K35N - BIN1 could be com - pensated by co - overexpressing wild - type BIN1 , while this was not the case for the D K21 and R24C mutants ( Böhm et al . , 2014 ) , con - ﬁrming the dominant effect of the latter two mutations . But the deleterious effect of these mutants may come from another reason . Mim et al . ( 2012 ) found that the N - terminal amphipathic helix of endophilin , another N - BAR protein , forms homo - interactions between helix rungs , and that these interac - tions are crucial for the formation of the N - BAR lattice on a mem - brane tube . A similar observation was recently made for the BIN1 lattice ( Adam et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , the deleterious effect on T - tubule biogenesis of CNM - linked BIN1 mutations in the amphi - pathic helix might be linked to its role in the assembly of the BIN1 scaffold . The possible conﬁgurations of interacting amphipathic helices in the helical scaffold had two energetically favourable positions ( Mim et al . , 2012 ) . In one case , the two helices interacted over the whole length while in the other they were slightly shifted by about a third of their length . In this shifted position , the C - terminal residues of the amphipathic helix should then be less cru - cial for the polymerization of BIN1 as they would not participate in the rung interactions . This could explain why D K21 and R24C cause CNM already in the heterozygous state while adults carrying a heterozygous K35N mutation had no symptoms , as K35 is one of the last residues of the amphipathic helix ( Löw et al . , 2008 ) . It should be noted that the few adults with known heterozygous K35N mutation ( Nicot et al . , 2007 ) were parents of young children and therefore one cannot exclude that they also develop ( ed ) symp - toms of heterozygous CNM later in their life , after publication of the study . 2 . 4 . CNM - linked mutations in the BAR domain of BIN1 decrease its tubulation property Two recessive mutations causing CNM were found in the BAR domain itself ( Claeys et al . , 2010 ; Nicot et al . , 2007 ) . In both muta - tions ( D151N , R154Q ) , single charged amino acids are replaced by polar uncharged ones . From their position in the concave face of the BAR dimer ( Fig . 2C and D ) , it is expected that the mutated resi - dues participate in membrane binding . Indeed , the position of the two mutations is at tips of the BIN1 dimer , and a cryo EM structure of BIN1 bound to membrane tubes shows that the tip regions of the BIN1 BAR are deeply inserted into the membrane ( Adam et al . , 2015 ) . This would ﬁt with the sideways / upwards facing residues affected in these mutants . Also , heterodimers of WT and D151N ( or R154Q ) could form , explaining the recessive character of these mutations . Surprisingly , both mutations affect exon 6 , which is present in all BIN1 isoforms . All BIN1 isoforms should therefore be affected , 40 A . Hohendahl et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 196 ( 2016 ) 37 – 47 and not only the muscle - speciﬁc isoform 8 . Thus , the observed tissue - speciﬁcity of the mutant phenotypes of D151N and R154Q must arise from a tissue - speciﬁc function or a tissue - speciﬁc set of partners . In contrast to the K35N ( N - terminal amphipathic helix ) mutant , the decrease in membrane tubulation in cells was also observed in vitro ( Picas et al . , 2014 ; Wu et al . , 2014 ) . Membrane binding of the D151N and R154Q mutants was decreased ( Wu et al . , 2014 ) and their localisation was different from WT BIN1 in the muscle ( Böhm et al . , 2013 ; Toussaint et al . , 2011 ) . The onset of CNM in patients with D151N or R154Q BIN1 is later than in those having the K35N mutation ( childhood vs . embryonic onset ) . Furthermore , K35N - CNM is more severe ( Claeys et al . , 2010 ; Nicot et al . , 2007 ) , suggesting that the amphipathic helix function might be more important for BIN1’s muscular function than the one changed in the D151N and R154Q BIN1 mutants . The fact that K35N - CNM is more severe may account for another function of the amphipathic helix than simply the proposed tubulation prop - erty ( observed in cells ) , as the D151N and R154Q BIN1 mutants , for which the tubulation decrease was even conﬁrmed in vitro , have a stronger tubulation phenotype but milder CNM symptoms and onset . As proposed above , this ‘‘second” function of the amphi - pathic helix could be the formation of interactions between adja - cent turns of the helix , helping polymerization of BIN1 . It has been proposed that the crescent shape of BAR domains and the amphipathic helices have two distinct roles : while the crescent shape of BAR domains would sense membrane curvature , the amphipathic helices would actually induce it ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ; Farsad et al . , 2001 ) . The CNM - related BIN1 mutants in these regions were not going along this proposition . While a mutation in the amphipathic helix should have resulted in a membrane tubula - tion defect , no signiﬁcant tubulation defect was observed in vitro ( K35N , Wu et al . , 2014 ) . The D151N and R154Q mutants should have shown a membrane curvature sensing defect instead of show - ing reduced membrane tubulation , whereas the opposite was observed ( Wu et al . , 2014 ) . 2 . 5 . CNM - linked BIN1 mutations in the muscle - speciﬁc PI motif decrease BIN1’s membrane tubulation properties Only one known CNM - linked mutation affects the PI motif , the domain which speciﬁcally interacts with phosphoinositides ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) . The progression of this type of CNM was very rapid upon the onset of the disease , two out of three patients died 2 – 4 years after the onset . This mutation is a splice acceptor site muta - tion ( Böhm et al . , 2013 ) . The splice donor site at the end of exon 10 mistakenly binds to the splice acceptor site of exon 12 , as the splice acceptor site of exon 11 is mutated ( IVS10 - 1G > A ; intervening sequence 10 , position (cid:1) 1 , G - to - A conversion ) . Only the muscle - speciﬁc isoforms 8 and 10 ( Fig . 1 ) are affected by the mutation because the splice acceptor site of exon 11 is anyway not used in the other isoforms . The tissue - speciﬁcity of the IVS - 1G > A muta - tion is thus far more easy to explain than for the other BIN1 muta - tions causing CNM . With this mutation , isoforms 8 and 10 are reverted to the ubiquitous form , therefore patients do not express muscle - speciﬁc isoforms . Thus , it is predicted that in these patients , the muscle - speciﬁc properties of BIN1 , in particular the speciﬁc , phosphoinositide dependent , recruitment to the plasma membrane to induce T - tubule formation , should be lost . Indeed , the localisation of BIN1 in the muscle was observed to be altered in patients with this mutation ( Böhm et al . , 2013 ) . Also , the tubu - lation was decreased in cultured myotubes and in vitro experi - ments ( Böhm et al . , 2013 ; Wu and Baumgart , 2014 ) when comparing BIN1 with and without the PI motif . The CNM - phenotype of the IVS10 - 1G > A mutation drastically illustrates either or both of the following hypotheses . The ﬁrst hypothesis would be that the speciﬁc recruitment of BIN1 to phosphoinositides is indeed crucial for the proper muscle - speciﬁc function of BIN1 . The second hypothesis is based on the observa - tion ( see next sub - chapter for more detail ) that the PI motif can also bind to the SH3 domain ( Kojima et al . , 2004 ; Wu and Baumgart , 2014 ) . This interaction could be inhibitory , and partici - pate in the regulation of dynamin recruitment by BIN1 bound to phosphoinositides ( see discussion below ) . This would explain also that mutants lacking the PI motif have similar effects in patients than hyperactive dynamin 2 mutants ( see discussion below ) . The variability of the CNM onset may account for different func - tions of BIN1 during development and maintenance of muscles . Strikingly , the skeletal muscle phenotype of bin1 morphant zebra - ﬁsh embryos , notably the disorganization of triads , could be res - cued by both BIN1 with the PI motif ( isoform 8 ) and BIN1 without the PI motif ( isoform 9 ) ( Smith et al . , 2014 ) . This supports a speciﬁc role of the PI motif during muscle maturation and main - tenance rather than during early development ( Smith et al . , 2014 ) . 2 . 6 . CNM - linked BIN1 mutations in the SH3 domain decrease the interaction with dynamin The SH3 domain of BIN1 is important for its interaction with PRD - domain - containing proteins like dynamin and is present in all 11 isoforms reported till today ( Uniprot ) , therefore mutations in the SH3 domain also affect the neuronal and ubiquitous iso - forms . In this case , explaining the tissue - speciﬁcity of the induced muscle phenotype revealed complex . Four CNM mutations were found in this domain so far ( Böhm et al . , 2010 ; Böhm et al . , 2014 ; Nicot et al . , 2007 ) . Two of these , Q573X and K575X , lead to a 20 % - truncation of the SH3 domain amino acid sequence due to premature stop codons ( Böhm et al . , 2014 ; Nicot et al . , 2007 ) while the other two , P593HfsX54 and X594DfsX53 , cause a frame shift and add 52 additional amino acids to the SH3 domain ( Böhm et al . , 2014 ) . No functional studies for these last two mutations have been reported yet , making it difﬁcult to draw conclusions on the disease mechanism . Both are dominant mutations and cause mild and late - onset CNM already in the heterozygous case , in con - trast to the SH3 - domain - truncating mutations Q573X and K575X whose heterozygous carriers are healthy but which cause a more severe CNM with early onset when homozygous . There are several functional studies about the K575X mutant , which could also account for the effect of the Q573X mutation due to their very similar SH3 - domain truncations . In both mutants , the last a - helix and the last two b - sheets of the SH3 domain are missing ( Fig . 2B and Owen et al . , 1998 ) . The ﬁrst consequence is likely a destabilisation and potential misfolding of the whole SH3 domain , because the two deleted b - sheets are normally part of a b - barrel which forms the inner scaffold of many SH3 domains ( Owen et al . , 1998 ) . The second consequence is that the dynamin binding site is lacking an important hydrophobic residue ( F588 ) in the K575X mutant , required for dynamin binding in vitro ( Owen et al . , 1998 ) . The decreased dynamin - binding capacity of the truncated K575X mutant was indeed conﬁrmed in vitro ( Nicot et al . , 2007 ) . The K575X mutation did not affect the mem - brane tubulation ability of overexpressed BIN1 in COS - 1 cells ( Nicot et al . , 2007 ) . In contrast , and as expected , dynamin was not recruited to these tubules ( Nicot et al . , 2007 ) . A recent study tested whether the recruitment of dynamin to BIN1 positive struc - tures was only mediated via direct dynamin 2 - BIN1 interactions ( Picas et al . , 2014 ) or via dynamin’s known curvature sensing prop - erties ( Roux et al . , 2010 ) . The results suggested that dynamin 2 recruitment to BIN1 positive membrane tubules might also be due to BIN1’s ability to cluster PIPs , which in turn recruit dynamin 2 . Additionally , the SH3 domain of BIN1 could of course still recruit dynamin to these regions via a direct interaction with dynamin’s PRD domain . This would speak for the fact that BIN1 can still A . Hohendahl et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 196 ( 2016 ) 37 – 47 41 partially recruit dynamin , even with a truncated SH3 domain in the case of the K575X mutant ( Nicot et al . , 2007 ) . A difﬁculty in unfolding the disease mechanism of the K575X BIN1 mutant lies in the ability of the PI motif to interact with the WT SH3 domain but not with the K575X SH3 mutant ( Wu and Baumgart , 2014 ) . Since this mutant shows an increase in mem - brane tubulation in vitro ( Wu and Baumgart , 2014 ) , it has been proposed that the SH3 - PI interaction may play as an intra - molecular inhibition , which could be released by BIN1 binding to either the membrane or dynamin . The increased curvature induc - ing properties of the K575X - mutated protein would therefore result from a decreased autoinhibition . But the primary role of BIN1’s SH3 domain is to bind to dyna - min . Dynamin is a GTPase that tubulates lipid membranes by form - ing helical polymers around membrane tubes . It also constricts the membrane , leading to ﬁssion upon GTP hydrolysis . In the follow - ing , we describe the effect of the mutations found in dynamin 2 in some CNM - related mutations , and discuss the interplay between dynamin and BIN1 in the speciﬁc case of the T - tubule biogenesis . 3 . Dynamin 2 in CNM Dynamin is a large GTPase that mediates membrane ﬁssion at the ﬁnal step of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Dynamin polymer - izes around the neck of clathrin - coated buds and severs the mem - brane upon GTP hydrolysis , in order to release the vesicle in the cytoplasm . Other less known functions comprise roles in clathrin independent endocytosis and actin dynamics ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ) . In mammalian cells there are three dynamin genes that share a similar sequence and the same domain structure . Dynamin 1 is expressed in the brain , dynamin 2 is ubiquitous and dynamin 3 is expressed in lungs , testis and brain ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) . Dynamins are constituted of ﬁve domains , starting from the N - terminus with the G - domain , in charge of GTP hydrolysis . It is connected to the rest of the protein through a ﬂexible hinge called the Bundle Sig - naling Element ( BSE or neck ) . At the other side of the BSE , the ‘‘stalk” region comprises two distinct sequence parts , the middle domain and the GTPase Enhancing Domain ( GED ) . The stalk region mediates dimer formation and further interactions that allow self - assembly . The Pleckstrin Homology ( PH ) domain binds the plasma membrane through speciﬁc phosphoinositides ( especially PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) . As discussed above , the PRD domain is deputed to the binding to and recruitment of other proteins , in particular BIN1 . It deﬁnes the speciﬁc functions of the three dynamins as its sequence is the most variable between variants , allowing for differential bind - ing of dynamin partners ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Raimondi et al . , 2011 ) . Dynamin function in membrane ﬁssion involves its GTPase activity that is up regulated by polymerization and lipid binding ( Smirnova et al . , 1999 ; Warnock et al . , 1996 ) , allowing the action of dynamin to be maximal only when polymerized at the mem - brane neck . Structural data showed that in absence of nucleotide , the PH domain is ﬂipped - back onto the stalk , having speciﬁc inter - actions ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ) with both the stalk and the GTPase domain , that were broken upon polymerization ( Reubold et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , it was proposed that the PH domain , when ﬂipped and bound to the stalk and the GTPase domain , would be an inhi - bitory ‘‘closed” state of dynamin which would be release when the PH domain would bind the membrane , activating the GTPase and the polymerization of dynamin . Speciﬁc heterozygous mutations in the ubiquitous dynamin 2 ( Uniprot ID P50570 - 1 , UGID 164319 ) lead to autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy ( ADCNM ) ( Bitoun et al . , 2005 ) . The clini - cal aspects of ADCNM caused by mutations of dynamin 2 are variable depending on the speciﬁc mutation involved ( Bitoun et al . , 2009b ) , and occasionally even for the same mutation . ADCNM can have mild , intermediate or severe forms . The age of onset is also very variable and ranges from early ( neonatal and childhood ) and intermediate ( adolescence ) to late onset ( adult - hood ) ( Böhm et al . , 2012 ) . The only tissue that is affected by CNM - related dynamin 2 mutations is the muscle , but the mutations causing CNM involve the ubiquitous dynamin 2 whose functions are necessary in the whole organism . How a tissue - speciﬁc disease can be caused by mutations in a ubiquitous protein is still unclear , but analysing the effect of these mutations at the biochemical and functional levels supports a muscle - speciﬁc structural role of dynamin 2 inde - pendent of its function in membrane ﬁssion . 3 . 1 . Biochemical , structural and cellular aspects of CNM - related dynamin 2 mutations ADCNM shares the major cellular and sub - cellular phenotypes with other forms of CNM such as centralized nuclei , predomi - nance of type I ﬁbres ( slowly contracting and less power - generating than type II ﬁbres ) , muscle weakness and atrophy . But it also implicates an abnormal radial distribution of sar - coplasmic strands not found in CNM caused by the mutations of other genes ( Böhm et al . , 2012 ) . Among the mutations of dynamin 2 that cause CNM , the major - ity are missense mutations located in the stalk ( middle and GED domains ) and in the PH domain . All the mutations that have been biochemically characterized ( R465W , S619L , A618T , E368K , D V625 and R369W ) show an increase in basal GTPase activity and less GTP - induced disassembly as compared to wild type dynamin 2 ( Chin et al . , 2015 ; James et al . , 2014 ; Kenniston and Lemmon , 2010 ; Wang et al . , 2010 ) . R369W , S619L and D V625 have also been shown to have a higher ability to self - assemble , which may account for their reduced disassembly rate . Their basal GTPase activity is higher than the wild type , but does not increase upon assembly . Thus , biochemical data available for these mutations show a gain of function phenotype , both for assembly and for GTPase activity , suggesting that the auto - inhibitory mechanism discussed above for the PH domain is not functional in these mutants . Indeed , among the CNM - related dynamin 2 mutations , the majority is positioned at the interface ( or in close proximity ) between the stalk and the PH domain in the dimer structure in absence of nucleotide ( see Table 2 and Fig . 3 ) . Moreover , the major - ity of CNM - related mutations in this interface locally change the charge or the hydrophobicity of the residues and could be accounted for a major disruption of the interface . Although no data is available for other CNM - related mutations in this interface ( E368Q , R369Q , F372C , V375G , D614N , A618D , L621P , P627R and P627H ) ( Bitoun et al . , 2005 ; Böhm et al . , 2012 ; Catteruccia et al . , 2013 ; Echaniz - Laguna et al . , 2007 ; Jungbluth et al . , 2010 ; Kierdaszuk et al . , 2013 ; Neto et al . , 2015 ; Susman et al . , 2010 ) , one could predict that they would have the same effect on the auto - inhibitory conformation of dynamin . The most common dynamin 2 mutation R456W that causes CNM ( Böhm et al . , 2012 ) is also positioned in the stalk domain , but targets another intermolecular interface of the protein . It loca - lises to the outer monomer , where it interfaces the BSE of the inner monomer facing an asparagine and a lysine residue ( Reubold et al . , 2015 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . The mutation of a polar and positively charged resi - due ( arginine ) to a hydrophobic residue ( tryptophan ) could cause a disruption of this interface , causing the same release of the auto - inhibitory conformation than for mutations in the PH - stalk inter - face . Consistently , the R456W mutation shares many aspects of the phenotype of the stalk - PH mutations , being hyperactive and 42 A . Hohendahl et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 196 ( 2016 ) 37 – 47 more stable in the presence of GTP , suggesting a lack of the auto - inhibitory regulation . The remaining known CNM - related dynamin 2 mutations ( R522C , R522H , R523G , E540K , E560K , E650K and donor splice site deletion between exon 17 and 18 ; Bitoun et al . , 2009a , b ; Böhm et al . , 2012 ; Catteruccia et al . , 2013 ; Jeub et al . , 2008 ; Susman et al . , 2010 ) have not yet been biochemically or biologically char - acterized and they all reside in the PH domain ( except E650K , located in the stalk domain ) in regions probably necessary for the interactions with lipids or the regulation of self - assembly upon lipid interaction . But what could be the consequence of this gain of function onto T - tubule biogenesis , and why would it be muscle - speciﬁc , since these mutations appear on the ubiquitous form of dynamin 2 ? Important clues came out from the in vivo analysis of these mutants , both in endocytic and T - tubule biogenesis function of dynamin 2 : while overexpression of these mutations dramatically impairs endocytosis in cultured cells , heterozygous patients’ cells express the mutant and the wild - type at similar levels , and show no defect in CME ( Bitoun et al . , 2009b ; Koutsopoulos et al . , 2011 ; Sidiropoulos et al . , 2012 ) .

These ﬁndings show that the disease is probably not related to the function of dynamin in CME , whose alteration causes embryonic lethality , and that these mutations seem to have very little effect on CME . Moreover , a gain of function of dynamin 2 in CME is likely to have no physiological impact , as CME would just go faster . However , a recent study has shown a slight impairment in clathrin - independent EGF , cholera toxin uptake and EGFR downregulation as well as a defect in trafﬁcking of p75 receptor from the Golgi to the plasma membrane in stable cell lines expressing physiological levels of the hyperactive dyna - min 2 mutations R465W and E368K ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . This may cause signalling deregulation in these patients , which may account for the severity of some forms . As a conclusion , the biochemical , biological and clinical analysis of CNM - related dynamin 2 mutations has shown that they have a global gain of function with no dramatic impact on the ubiquitous functions of dynamin 2 in CME . The pathology must therefore arise from the alteration of another function of dynamin 2 delimited to a muscle - speciﬁc role . 3 . 2 . Gain of function dynamin 2 mutations alter a tissue - speciﬁc balance The fact that none of the ubiquitous functions of dynamin 2 are defective in a heterozygous background of CNM - related dynamin 2 mutations leads to consider tissue - speciﬁc functions of dynamin 2 in the muscle . In muscle ﬁbres , dynamin 2 has been found along the Z - line , co - localizing with a - actinin and desmin . Dynamin 2 is located in close proximity to dihydropyridine receptor ( DHPR ) , a marker of T - tubules ( Cowling et al . , 2011 ; Durieux et al . , 2010 ) , which suggests that dynamin 2 , like BIN1 , could be implicated in T - tubule biogenesis . The presence of dynamin 2 on T - tubules still has to be shown . The analysis of CNM - related dynamin 2 muta - tions in animal models and in cells strongly implicates that the hyperactivation of dynamin 2 is deleterious to the maintenance and stabilization of T - tubules and triads , suggesting a tissue - speciﬁc role of dynamin in muscles related to T - tubule and triad shaping . The expression of human dynamin 2 carrying the muta - tion R465W in adult mice results in a decrease in muscle mass due to the appearance of atrophic ﬁbres . Histological analysis showed misalignment of Z - lines and triad defects such as abnor - mally shaped T - tubules and a swollen sarcoplasmic reticulum ( Cowling et al . , 2011 ) . In heterozygous mice for the same mutation , a slight disorganization of T - tubules , sarcoplasmic reticulum and an increase in cytosolic Ca 2 + are also observed , although defects in the triad structure are milder ( Durieux et al . , 2010 ) . Similar results have been obtained in non - mammalian organ - isms , supporting a conserved role of dynamin 2 in T - tubule devel - opment through evolution . In larvae of transgenic Drosophila ectopically expressing one of the human dynamin 2 mutations R465W , A618T or S619L in the muscle displayed fragmented T - tubules even when expressed later in development when T - tubules are already formed ( Chin et al . , 2015 ) . In zebraﬁsh , where extensive disorganization of triad structures and T - tubule fragmentation can be observed when the human dynamin 2 S619L mutant is expressed during development , these defects led to impaired excitation - contraction coupling ( Gibbs et al . , 2014 ) . Altogether , these results suggest a tissue - speciﬁc function of dynamin 2 in the establishment of the T - tubule structures in mus - cle ﬁbres . T - tubules are a result of plasma membrane tubulation carried out most probably by caveolin - 3 and BIN1 . Dynamin 2 could either serve as a scaffolding protein as it is able to form a more rigid scaffold then N - BAR proteins ( Frost et al . , 2008 ) , which could help the maintenance and the resistance of the T - tubule system needed for muscle contraction . An alternative hypothesis is that dynamin 2 could be involved in T - tubule length regulation through membrane ﬁssion . Another hint of a possible function of dynamin in T - tubule shaping comes from the BIN1 mutant K575X : its impairment of the SH3 domain , thus loss of interaction with dynamin 2 , could account for its pathological outcome in patients ( Nicot et al . , 2007 ) . However , the ﬁssion activity of dynamin 2 must be blocked or tightly regulated to play this role , otherwise dynamin would exces - sively cut these T - tubules , leading to a fragmented T - tubule sys - tem . In a wild type background , dynamin 2 ﬁssion activity should be somehow inhibited or regulated at the T - tubule . This also explains why gain - of function mutations would have a dra - matic effect speciﬁcally at the T - tubule , as enhancing the ﬁssion activity of dynamin 2 would cause disruption of the T - tubule sys - tem . But how dynamin 2 ﬁssion activity would be speciﬁcally inhibited at the T - tubule ? As described in the following , this may arise from its speciﬁc interaction with BIN1 . 3 . 3 . Interplay between dynamin , BIN1 and MTM1 functions in T - tubule biogenesis BIN1 may speciﬁcally recruit dynamin 2 to the T - tubule system ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) and inhibit its ﬁssion activity . Supporting this assertion , other N - BAR proteins such as endophilin and amphiphy - sin regulate dynamin’s ﬁssion activity , but the nature of the regu - lation ( activation versus inhibition ) seemed to vary for different N - BAR proteins and in different conditions ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Meinecke et al . , 2013 ; Neumann and Schmid , 2013 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ) . In some experiments ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ; Farsad et al . , 2001 ) , N - BAR proteins associated with dynamin have displayed an inhibitory action on dynamin ﬁssion activity . Thus , one could postulate that BIN1 and dynamin 2 form a heteropolymer that would block dynamin 2’s ability to sever the membrane . However , this effect has not been reproducibly established , and contradic - tory results have been obtained ( Meinecke et al . , 2013 ; Neumann and Schmid , 2013 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ; Yoshida et al . , 2004 ) . In muscle ﬁbres expressing CNM - related dynamin 2 mutations , the abnormal hyperactivity of these mutants could overcome the inhibition of dynamin - ﬁssion activity , shifting the equilibrium between dynamin 2 scaffolding with a controlled membrane ﬁs - sion function towards unregulated membrane ﬁssion . This would result in the fragmented and abnormally shaped T - tubules , as observed in the animal models expressing hyperactive dynamin 2 mutations ( Chin et al . , 2015 ; Gibbs et al . , 2014 ) . Evidences supporting this model come from experiments in cells . Upon overexpression of BIN1 ( or other N - BAR proteins ) in cultured cells , an extensive membrane tubulation is observed . This effect can be counteracted by overexpressing dynamin ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) or by expressing a CNM - related hyperactive mutation ( Chin et al . , 2015 ; Gibbs et al . , 2014 ) . In these examples , the plasma membrane tubulation is the result of an imbalance between the tubulation activity of BIN1 ( higher ) and the ﬁssion activity of dyna - min ( lower ) : the balance can be restored by either increasing the amount of dynamin , or by expressing a dynamin mutant with increased activity . Also , as described above , mutations in the SH3 domain of BIN1 could impair its interaction with dynamin 2 , releasing dynamin’s inhibition . In these mutants , dynamin 2 would not be inhibited enough to allow for proper T - tubule maintenance . However , as BIN1 also participates in the recruitment of dynamin 2 to the T - tubule system , together with phosphoinositides , one may question if the reduced recruitment of dynamin 2 in the SH3 BIN1 mutants may counteract the reduced inhibition of dynamin ﬁssion activity . In this context , the role of the phosphoinositides may be essential to understand the mechanism of the disease . Myotubularin , the 44 A . Hohendahl et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 196 ( 2016 ) 37 – 47 third protein causing CNM when mutated , may be critical as it is a 3 - phosphatase that can interact with BIN1 . In Royer et al . ( 2013 ) , the authors found that myotubularin ( MTM1 ) binds BIN1 in vitro and in skeletal muscle . Similar to the effect of binding of dynamin’s PRD domain to BIN1 , the authors propose that MTM1 may help dynamin and BIN1 tubulating activity . It would also require MTM1’s phosphatase activity . MTM1 is a 3 - phosphatase and its substrates are PI ( 3 ) P and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . As BIN1 was shown to bind to PI ( 5 ) P as well as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in contrast to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fugier et al . , 2011 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ; Picas et al . , 2014 ) , one can hypothesize that MTM1 might promote the formation of 5 - phosphate phosphoinosi - tides , such as PI ( 5 ) P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , by increasing the level of their precursors ( PI and PI ( 5 ) P ) . These 5 - phosphate phosphoinositides will then recruit BIN1 and dynamin to the plasma or T - tubule membrane . Furthermore , Royer et al . ( 2013 ) observed that both Q573X and K575X BIN1 mutants have an increased interaction with MTM1 in vitro . A plausible mechanism would thus be that the same SH3 mutants of BIN1 have a decreased interaction with dynamin and an increased interaction with MTM1 . The defective recruit - ment of dynamin by the BIN1 SH3 mutant could thus be compen - sated by the increase of 5 - phosphate phosphoinositides resulting from a higher recruitment of MTM1 to BIN1 structures . However in this case , dynamin’s ﬁssion activity would not be inhibited , since the interaction with BIN1 is lost , and would thus lead to a dis - rupted T - tubule system . The BIN1 - MTM1 interaction is also interesting when compared with other N - BAR / phosphatase pairs : for example , endophilin physically interacts with and recruits the lipid phosphatase synap - tojanin to the membrane of clathrin - coated pits ( Perera et al . , 2006 ) . In the synaptojanin - endophilin case , the synaptojanin recruitment is proposed to result in a decrease of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 con - centration and to allow for ﬁssion and uncoating of clathrin - coated pits ( Perera et al . , 2006 ) . The striking difference to the synaptojanin - endophilin pair is that MTM1 recruitment by BIN1 should , via increasing the concentration of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 precursor , lead to an increase of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which in turn would recruit more BIN1 and dynamin . This opposite effect correlates nicely with the idea that the scaffold which stabilises T - tubules would have a pos - itive feedback loop where the scaffold proteins increase their respective recruitment , whereas the scaffold and coat implicated in the formation of a clathrin - coated vesicle is temporary . 4 . General conclusions We have reviewed in this article how different groups of muta - tions disturb the structure and function of BIN1 , leading to CNM . BIN1 mutations in the amphipathic helix could decrease BIN1’s scaffolding properties on membrane tubes . Mutations in the tip region of the BAR domain dimer may decrease BIN1’s tubulation properties . Also in the case of splice - site mutations resulting in a loss of the PI motif , BIN1 tubulates less and the T - tubule formation and / or maintenance is impaired . In contrast , mutations in the SH3 domain do not impair BIN1’s curvature inducing features but might affect both dynamin and MTM1 levels at the T - tubules . CNM - related mutations in dynamin 2 are hyperactive and thus correspond to a gain of function . As long as they are heterozygous , they cannot impair clathrin - mediated endocytosis because they maintain the ability to mediate membrane ﬁssion and their action is regulated by redundant factors and regulators . In T - tubule bio - genesis and maintenance , it is primarily the membrane scaffolding and tubulation activities or a moderate ﬁssion activity of dynamin that are at work . T - tubule biogenesis thus requires a down regula - tion of dynamin 2’s intrinsic ﬁssion activity . Thus , dynamin 2 mutations that have increased ﬁssion activity which are not harmful for CME , probably cause massive problems in the T - tubule system because of their inability to be down regulated . Thus , the balance between membrane tubulating and ﬁssion activ - ities of dynamin is crucial for the T - tubule biogenesis . Given that CNM - associated dynamin mutants are hyperactive and BIN1 mutants have a decrease - of - function , CNMs are one example where an N - BAR protein seems to negatively regulate dynamin’s ﬁssion activity . To test this hypothesis , one could over - express dynamin 2 GTPase defective mutants in cells with CNM - associated BIN1 mutations . If this rescues the low - function BIN1 phenotype ( fragmented T - tubules ) , this would clearly speak for a role of BIN1 in preventing dynamin from cutting T - tubules . Fitting with this theory , a patent has been published for the idea to treat CNM patients with dynamin inhibitors ( Laporte and Cowling , European Patent EP2862928A1 ) . Another interesting matter of the CNMs is its tissue - speciﬁcity to muscles , while other cellular functions seemed unaffected by the CNM mutations , even though most of the mutations affect ubiquitously expressed exons of BIN1 and dynamin 2 . We hypoth - esize that the tissue - speciﬁcity of the pathology is due to the fact that T - tubules are one of few cases where membrane tubules are formed in cells and are required to be incredibly stable over time , while they represent ideal targets for dynamin’s ﬁssion activity . Thus a tight regulation of the levels of BIN1 and dynamin , as well as of the balance between their speciﬁc activities is required in the T - tubule system , with very little redundancy as compared to the CME system . Most probably , the triple complex between dynamin 2 , BIN1 and MTM1 is at the heart of this balance between mem - brane tubulation and ﬁssion activity , as many of the mutations found in these three proteins affect the protein - protein interaction domains . Overall , if membrane deformation properties are too low , the T - tubule formation is impaired . If ﬁssion activity is too high , T - tubule are snapped too early after formation .

We used the available knowledge from in vitro experiments and from experiments using cell culture or entire organisms , as well as clinical descriptions and histopathological analyses from CNM patients . A table for each protein summarises the position in the amino acid sequence , exon , domain , disease segregation , disease severity , onset , main functional consequence ( as far as known ) and the reference paper of the discovery of the mutation . For each protein , the position of the mutated amino acids is shown in the available 3D protein structure . For dynamin 2 , the currently known functional consequences of the mutated amino acids are similar , independently of the positioning of the mutation , while for BIN1 the domain which is aﬀected by the mutation changes the structural and functional consequences . This is why for BIN1 , the mutations are grouped by the domain which is aﬀected . Mutations in the N - terminal amphipathic helix of BIN1 suggested the importance of this helix for BIN1’s scaﬀolding properties , which are impaired when mutated . Mutations in the BAR domain itself seemed to decrease BIN1 - induced tubulation . Also when the PI motif is lost in a splice - site mutant for the respective exon , BIN1 tubulates less , and on top T - tubule formation and / or stability is af - fected . Interestingly , the PI motif is muscle - speciﬁc . All the observed changes in tubulation and scaﬀolding were in line with the phenotype in patients and dogs that the T - tubule network was abnormally disrupted . T - tubules are tubular structures which connect the plasma membrane of the muscle ﬁbre ( myocyte ) with the actin ﬁbres . T - tubules transmit the arriving depolarisation upon the arrival of an action potential deep into the cell , allowing for rapid muscle contraction upon action potentials . Mutations in the SH3 domain were , on the other hand , not observed to change tubulation or scaﬀolding properties , ﬁtting with the knowledge that the BAR domain and not the SH3 domain interacts with the membrane . Instead , these mutants showed a diﬀerent interaction with dynamin 2 , correlating with the knowledge that SH3 domains is the domain that interacts with dynamin and other PRD - domain containing proteins . For dynamin 2 , the ﬁrst idea that endocytosis would be aﬀected due to the mutations did not seem to be true in patients . As CNM dynamin 2 mutants are hyperactive , dynamin can still mediate ﬁssion ( see Section 2 . 1 . 4 ) and its action is , at least concerning endocytosis , enough regulated by other factors to be functional . As patients with DNM2 mutations have a disrupted T - tubule system and as the mutations are hyperactive , dynamin’s original role in the T - tubule system does not seem to be membrane ﬁssion , but in contrast the stabilisation of T - tubules . The review puts the hypothesis forward that wild - type dynamin’s ﬁssion properties are inhibited by BIN1 . This intracellular balance is disturbed by either decreasing BIN’s membrane binding and scaﬀolding properties ( BIN1 CNM mutants ) or by increasing dynamin’s activity ( DNM2 CNM mutants ) , leading in both cases to impairment of T - tubule formation or stability and the CNM speciﬁc symptoms of muscle weakness and muscle waisting .

For membranes whose width and length are in a considerably higher order of magnitude than the bilayer thick - ness ( µ m vs . nm range ) , one can neglect the bilayer thickness and consider the membrane as a 2D surface . Membranes can be deformed in three diﬀerent ways ( Figure 3 . 1 ) . Stretch - ing deﬁnes an area expansion during the application of isotropic forces that ﬁrst result in the unfolding of excess area stored in membrane ﬂuctuations ( entropic regime ) and then in an increase in the distance between lipid headgroups ( enthalpic regime ) . Membrane bending de - ﬁnes a deformation in 3D where the area is not changed but where the membrane adopts a 30 Technical Description Of The Setup For Measuring Membrane Fission Rates A B C C A B A B C Figure 3 . 1 : Membrane deformations .

Membrane shearing is the result of unisotropic forces that pull on the membrane without changing the area and lead to a re - arrangement of lipids . The elastic energy of a lipid membrane system can be described by the Canham - Helfrich Hamiltonian as a function of its shape ( Canham , 1970 ; Helfrich , 1973 ) : E el = σ ∆ A + (cid:90) A κ 2 J 2 d A ( 3 . 1 ) The energy contribution of membrane stretching is described by σ ∆ A . It is composed of the membrane tension σ , an elastic parameter which indicates to which degree the membrane is stretched , multiplied by the area diﬀerence due to stretching ∆ A . (cid:82) A κ 2 J 2 d A is the contribu - tion of membrane bending . κ is the membrane rigidity , a parameter that deﬁnes how energy consuming it is to bend the membrane and that depends on the lipid composition . The mean curvature J is deﬁned as : J = 1 R 1 + 1 R 2 ( 3 . 2 ) where R 1 and R 2 are the two principal radii that deﬁne a surface element ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . The integral takes into account all curvatures present in the given membrane system . As one can see , the Canham - Helfrich Hamiltonian does not include a term for the energy contribution of membrane shearing as it is negligible compared to the contributions of stretching and bending .

The Canham - Helfrich Hamiltonian can be calculated numerically in many cases , but only a few cases have simple analytical solutions . For example , calculating it for the 1D case of a membrane nanotube gives very simple solutions . Let us consider the free energy of a membrane nanotube that is extruded from an inﬁnite membrane reservoir ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . For a nanotube , the area expansion due to stretching ∆ A is equal to 2 π R tube L tube . The mean curvature J of a nanotube only depends on one radius ( R tube ) , because the other radius is parallel to the axis of the tube ( R 2 → ∞ ) , resulting in 1 R 2 → 0 . The product of f and L tube is added to the equation to include the force that is applied to hold the membrane tube . By replacing these values in the Canham - Helfrich Hamiltonian ( Equation 3 . 1 ) , we obtain the energy of the extruded nanotube ( Equation 3 . 3 ) : E el = 2 π R tube L tube ( σ + κ 2 R 2 tube ) − fL tube ( 3 . 3 ) Minimizing the energy of the membrane tube versus radius R tube results in Equation 3 . 4 : R tube 0 = (cid:114) κ 2 σ ( 3 . 4 ) The energy minimisation stems from the idea that one is interested in the radius of the tube at equilibrium which is reached very fast , depending on the membrane composition within a few seconds . R tube 0 describes the radius of the nanotube at equilibrium . Interestingly , R tube 0 is independent of the length of the nanotube , and only dependent on membrane rigidity κ and membrane tension σ . For membranes with high rigidity and low tension , tubes are wider . Low rigidity and high tension result in tubes that are more narrow . When minimising the free 32 Technical Description Of The Setup For Measuring Membrane Fission Rates energy of the membrane system for the length L tube and replacing R tube by (cid:112) κ 2 σ ( Equation 3 . 4 ) , Equation 3 . 5 for the force to hold the tube at equilibrium is obtained : f 0 = 2 π √ 2 κσ ( 3 . 5 ) The force at equilibrium will be high for high membrane rigidity and tension , and low for low membrane rigidity and tension . Equation 3 . 5 was experimentally veriﬁed by Evans et al . ( 1996 ) and Cuvelier et al . ( 2005 ) , using an experimental system similar to the nanotube pulling setup that I will present in the next section ( 3 . 2 ) . The experiments from Evans et al . ( 1996 ) and Cuvelier et al . ( 2005 ) were able to validate the force equation 3 . 5 , as the experimental results were in agreement with the predicted outcomes by this equation . 3 . 2 An Experimental System To Measure Membrane And Membrane Protein Properties This section introduces and explains the experimental setup that is used during this thesis for several purposes , namely measuring ﬁssion rates and eﬃciencies ( Chapter 4 ) , curvature inducing ( Section 3 . 2 . 4 ) and curvature sensing properties of proteins ( Chapter 5 ) . 3 . 2 . 1 Micropipette Aspiration To Control Membrane Tension Waugh and Evans ( 1979 ) introduced micropipette aspiration to study elastic properties of red blood cells . Two years later , the same technique was used to study elastic properties of giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) ( Kwok and Evans , 1981 ) . Aspiring a GUV with a micropipette leads to the formation of a membrane tongue inside the aspiration pipette due to the extra membrane area following membrane stretching ( Figure 3 . 4 ) . The membrane tension σ of the Aspiration pipette R pipette R GUV ∆ P GUV Figure 3 . 4 : Micropipette aspiration of a GUV . 3 . 2 An Experimental System To Measure Membrane And Membrane Protein Properties 33 GUV is set by the aspiration pressure ∆ P , the inner radius of the aspiration pipette R pipette and the radius of the GUV R GUV ( Equation 3 . 6 ) : σ = R pipette ∆ P 2 ( 1 − R pipette R GUV ) ( 3 . 6 ) This equation is obtained by applying the Young - Laplace equation ∆ P = 2 σ J twice , once for the interface of the GUV with the solution in the experimental chamber ( ∆ P chamb ) and once for the interface of the tongue with the liquid inside the pipette ( ∆ P tongue ) . Subtracting ∆ P chamb from ∆ P tongue leads to obtaining the total pressure diﬀerence ∆ P between the water reservoir of the aspiration pipette and the experimental chamber . Solving this new equation for σ gives Equation 3 . 6 . ∆ P can be controlled by connecting the micropipette to a tube that is ﬁlled with water and connected to a water reservoir that is displaceable in z . Changing the vertical position of the water reservoir by ∆ z results in a pressure diﬀerence ∆ P of : ∆ P = ρ water g ∆ z ( 3 . 7 ) with ρ water = 10 3 kgm 3 and g = 9 . 81 ms 2 . As we will see in Section 3 . 2 . 3 , these equations are used to calculate tension during membrane rigidity measurements . 3 . 2 . 2 The Nanotube Pulling Assay In Section 3 . 1 . 2 we have seen how the energy of a nanotube is described that was extruded from an inﬁnite membrane reservoir . The previous section ( 3 . 2 . 1 ) described a technique to set the membrane tension of a GUV by using an aspiration micropipette . Both concepts are combined in the nanotube pulling set up , where the GUV that is aspirated with an aspiration pipette is the membrane reservoir for the extrusion of a nanotube ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . Considering that the lipids that are part of the nanotube after extrusion are few compared to those that are part of the GUV , we can apply the force and membrane tension equations 3 . 4 and 3 . 5 from Section 3 . 1 . 2 . Due to the same approximation , a similar setup to the one presented in Figure 3 . 5 has been used to validate the force equation 3 . 5 ( Evans et al . , 1996 ; Cuvelier et al . , 2005 ) . Aspiration pipette Injection pipette Optical tweezers EndoDyn Figure 3 . 5 : Experimental setup of the nanotube pulling assay . 34 Technical Description Of The Setup For Measuring Membrane Fission Rates Figure 3 . 6 : Photography of the experimental chamber on top of an objective . Aspiration pipette ( lower left ) , two injection pipettes ( upper right ) . The experimental chamber is open on the sides for the micropipettes to enter . The liquid , typically 300 µ l , remains inside the chamber due to capillary action . In the nanotube pulling assay , the nanotube is extruded from a GUV by attaching a streptavidin - coated polystyrene bead to the GUV ( containing a small percentage of biotinylated lipids ) , on which we pull by means of optical tweezers . Optical tweezers consist of a focused laser beam . The resultant force of the forces applied by the photons when entering and existing the polystyrene bead push the bead towards the focal point of the laser beam . In our setup , the laser beam is focused via the objective of the microscope used for observation . The optical tweezers used for the nanotube pulling setup are on purpose adjusted to be weak , so that the force applied on the bead causes a visible shift in bead position that can be detected by brightﬁeld microscopy . Calibration of the optical tweezers by applying known forces and tracking the bead displacement indicates the stiﬀness of the optical tweezers . Stiﬀness deﬁnes which force is required to displace the bead by ∆ x . This then allows to determine the force that the tube applies on the bead based on the bead displacement . In addition , one or two injection pipettes are part of the setup ( Figure 3 . 5 , left ; Figure 3 . 6 , upper right ) with which proteins or any other components can be injected at the desired time point and for the desired duration . Each of the three micropipettes is connected to a diﬀerent water reservoir and a diﬀerent micromanipulator . The micromanipulators allow to move the pipettes in all three dimensions . 3 . 2 . 3 Membrane Rigidity Measurements The tube pulling setup can be used to measure membrane rigidity ( Cuvelier et al . , 2005 ) , employing the force equation 3 . 5 . For a given GUV , κ is constant , while membrane tension σ and force f are variable . Transcribing Equation 3 . 5 as f 2 = ( 8 π 2 κ ) σ ( 3 . 8 ) 3 . 2 An Experimental System To Measure Membrane And Membrane Protein Properties 35 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 2000 ∆σ , µN / m f 02 , p N 2 0 100 200 300 0 500 1000 1500 2000 σ , µN / m f 02 , p N 2 A B Figure 3 . 7 : Example of a membrane rigidity measurement , using a nanotube pulled from a GUV containing 99 % EPC , 1 % Rhodamine PE and 0 . 03 % biotinylated lipid . A , Plot of f 2 versus ∆ σ . B , Plot of f 2 versus σ . Slope : 5 . 8 ± 0 . 7 pN 2 µ N / m , κ = 17 . 5 ± 2 . 1 k B T . shows that σ is linearly proportional to f 2 . When experimentally varying the membrane tension of the GUV ( shown in Section 3 . 2 . 1 ) and recording ∆ z of the water reservoir displacement to calculate ∆ p ( Equation 3 . 7 ) and ∆ σ ( Equation 3 . 6 ) , and tracking the bead displacement to calculate the force f , then the slope of the plot of f 2 versus ∆ σ is equal to 8 π 2 κ . An example of such a plot is shown in Figure 3 . 7A . The linear ﬁt of the data points of the plot in Figure 3 . 7 to ax + b gives a slope of 5 . 8 ± 0 . 7 pN 2 µ N / m . As we can see , the ﬁt straight line does not go through ( 0 , 0 ) . This is due to the fact that we measured ∆ σ instead of absolute tension values , starting from an unknown starting tension of the GUV σ 0 . The negative x - intercept of the ﬁt straight line from the plot ( example in Figure 3 . 7 ) corresponds to this initial tension σ 0 . Adding σ 0 to the measured ∆ σ values gives the absolute tension σ . Plotting f 2 vs . σ results in 3 . 7B . Determining σ 0 is not needed for the calculation of the rigidity κ because the slope remains unchanged . In contrast , it is necessary for calculating the tube radius via Equations 3 . 4 and 3 . 9 , where the absolute membrane tension σ is required . 3 . 2 . 4 Measuring Curvature Sensing And Curvature Inducing Properties Of Proteins ( Incl . Summary Of Article 3 ) Apart from measuring membrane rigidity , the nanotube pulling setup can and has also been used to study properties of proteins that interact with the membrane . Sorre et al . ( 2012 ) used the technique to study curvature sensing and induction by the N - BAR protein amphiphysin . They injected amphiphysin on nanotubes in the tube pulling setup and measured the force before and during the injection of amphiphysin on the nanotube . By varying the aspiration before and during amphiphysin injection , they measured absolute tension in each case and could calculate the radius of the nanotube using Equation 3 . 9 , which is obtained by solving Equation 3 . 5 for κ and inserting it into Equation 3 . 4 : 36 Technical Description Of The Setup For Measuring Membrane Fission Rates R tube = f 4 πσ ( 3 . 9 ) They observed that amphiphysin preferentially bound to highly curved membranes , indepen - dently of the protein concentration . In contrast , amphiphysin did only induce curvature at intermediate to high bound protein densities . At intermediate bound densities , the force of the tube on the bead decreased upon amphiphysin binding , but the radius of the tube was still dependent on membrane tension . At high bound densities , the tube radius was independent of membrane tension but was instead set by the amphiphysin scaﬀold . At very low protein concentrations ( dilute limit ) , amphiphysin did not induce but only sensed curvature . During my thesis , I used the same approach to test curvature inducing properties of the clathrin adapter AP180 for a collaboration with my former lab colleague Mohammed Saleem . He studied clathrin polymerisation and observed that clathrin deformed GUVs when their membrane tension was low , but not when membrane tension was high ( Article 3 , Saleem et al . ( 2015 ) ) . As clathrin needs adapters to bind to the membrane , he used the clathrin adapter AP180 . Testing curvature deforming properties of AP180 was important in order to assign the observed phenotype either to clathrin alone , AP180 alone or to a combination of AP180 and clathrin . I injected AP180 on nanotubes in the tube pulling assay and measured the force before and during injection of AP180 . The force remained unchanged ( Figure 3 . 8 ) . This showed that clathrin was responsible , in combination with AP180 , for the membrane deformation and not AP180 alone . The paper “A balance between membrane elasticity and polymerization energy sets the shape of spherical clathrin coats” ( Article 3 , Saleem et al . ( 2015 ) ) to which I contributed can be found in the Appendix of this thesis . In summary , using in vitro reconstitution of clathrin polymerisation , followed by either EM or ﬂuorescence microscopy . two diﬀerent types of membrane deformations were observed , either shallow pits at moderate membrane tension or deep buds at low membrane tension . Also high membrane rigidity was opposing clathrin polymerisation . A theoretical model was developped to describe the competition between the energy loss to deform the membrane ( depending on membrane elastic parameters κ and σ ) , the energy gain by polymerisation of clathrin triskelia and the energy loss due to triskelia arms that are not bound to other triskelia before injection during injection 0 20 40 60 Fo r ce ( p N ) n . s .

Clathrin would only polymerise on the membrane if the energy gain due to polymerization is higher than the energy loss due to membrane bending , stretching and increased line tension . Mathematical calculations and experimental measurements allowed to give an estimate of the binding energy of 23 ± 3 k B T per triskelion . Roux et al . ( 2010 ) used the tube pulling technique to measure curvature - dependent dynamin polymerisation and to determine the concentration range in solution at which dynamin poly - merises in a curvature - dependent manner , as well as the curvature range in which dynamin nucleates at all . The tube pulling setup was also used by Prévost et al . ( 2015 ) to measure sensing and induction of negative curvature by the I - BAR ( inverted BAR , see also Section 2 . 2 . 1 ) protein IRSp53 . In contrast to the procedure that I used , the I - BAR protein was encapsulated into the GUV because I - BAR proteins sense negative and not positive curvature . Recently , the tube pulling assay was employed by Simunovic et al . ( 2016 ) , together with other approaches , to analyse how BAR proteins form a scaﬀold on membrane tubes and found that the amphipathic helices of the BAR domain are not required for scaﬀold formation . Simulations suggested that a rigid scaﬀold was already possible to be obtained as of a membrane coverage by the protein of only 30 – 40 % . Chen et al . ( 2016 ) , using among other techniques the tube pulling assay , came to the conclusion that amphipathic helices are not required for curvature sensing but do contribute to curvature sensing when the curvature is high ( r < 40 nm ) . 3 . 2 . 5 Measuring Dynamin - Mediated Membrane Fission Rates Another application of the nanotube pulling assay is to study membrane ﬁssion ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . In this study , a nanotube was pulled from a GUV and dynamin + GTP were injected . They deﬁned the ﬁssion time as the time between the appearance of the ﬁrst nucleation spot of dynamin on the tube and the moment that the tube was cut . They discovered that membrane ﬁssion was a stochastic process , in which not membrane constriction of dynamin on its own induced ﬁssion , but instead occured at a time point after constriction . As the process was stochastic , the probability p t that a tube had been cut until the time point t increased over time and converged to 100 % . The obtained data points were ﬁt to 1 − e − t τ , allowing to obtain the characteristic time τ until which half the tubes underwent ﬁssion in each condition . Fission occured in most cases either close to the bead or close to the GUV and only rarely in the middle of the tube . By increasing time resolution , ﬁssion was observed to take place at the border of dynamin polymers ( Figure 3 . 9 ) . While tension reduced the ﬁssion time , membrane rigidity was delaying ﬁssion . Low membrane tension also reduced ﬁssion in living cells . These ﬁndings were in agreement with a model in which membrane elastic parameters inﬂuence ﬁssion because ﬁssion occurs at the interface between a dynamin - constricted membrane tube and the bare membrane . Dynamin - mediated constriction reduces the energy barrier at this interface , so that ﬁssion then occurs spontaneously due to thermal ﬂuctuations of the membrane , leading to the hemiﬁssion state . These ﬁndings were essential for proposing the constriction model which is currently one of the two models at debate to explain dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion ( see Section 2 . 1 . 4 ) . 38 Technical Description Of The Setup For Measuring Membrane Fission Rates ‘‘dynamin - membrane edge’’ ) . By setting the constriction radius R c , s , and k ( see Extended Experimental Procedures ) and numerically minimizing the elastic energy of the membrane , we can calculate the shape of the dynamin - membrane edge ( Fig - ures 1F and 1G ) . The funnel shape of the dynamin - membrane edge is associated with a local increase in elastic energy that can be estimated numerically ( Figure 2B ) ( Shlomovitz et al . , 2011 ) . This elastic energy depends on the ratio a = R m / R c , where Figure 1 . Localization of Fission Events at Dynamin - Membrane Edges ( A ) Schematic drawing of the experimental set - up .

R m is the radius of the bare tube , which is set by membrane tension and bend - ing rigidity . Thus , the smaller R c is ( the more dynamin constricts ) , the higher the elastic energy of the dynamin - membrane edge is . We reasoned that the local increase of elastic energy of the membrane edge could favor ﬁssion by reducing its energy barrier . Fission was proposed to occur wherever the membrane reaches a hemi - ﬁssion state , when the membrane radius shrinks below a threshold R i (cid:31) 3 nm ( Ko - zlovsky and Kozlov , 2003 ) , comparable to the membrane thick - ness ( see ﬁssion intermediate in Figure 2A ) . The existence of such hemiﬁssion intermediate is supported by the experimental fact that ﬁssion is nonleaky ( Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ) . Reaching an intermediate state with such a strongly curved membrane is a rare event and must thus be the rate - limiting step of membrane Cell 151 , 619 – 629 , October 26 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 621 Figure 3 . 9 : Fission occured at the border of dynamin polymers ( green ) .

Following constriction , spontaneous ﬁssion of the membrane occurs due to thermal ﬂuctuations ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . We have also seen that BAR proteins directly interact with dynamin and the membrane and that dynamin was proposed to be recruited to vesicle necks by endophilin ( Sundborger et al . , 2011 ) . However , it is still under debate whether and how BAR and especially N - BAR proteins regulate ﬁssion itself . While endophilin was initially proposed to inhibit ﬁssion ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ) , recent results suggested the opposite ( Meinecke et al . , 2013 ; Neumann and Schmid , 2013 ) . In order to obtain clarity on this matter , we decided to measure ﬁssion rates and eﬃciencies for the endophilin - dynamin co - complex and employed electron microscopy to visualise its structure . 40 Thesis Work : Endophilin Inhibits Dynamin - Mediated Fission A summary of the article is presented in Section 4 . 3 . 4 . 2 Article 2 : The endophilin - dynamin co - complex inhibits membrane ﬁssion Manuscript in preparation .

INTRODUCTION Dynamin is a 97kDa GTPase that mediates membrane fission in several endocytic routes . Dynamin forms tetramers in solution via the stalk domain ( Muhlberg et al . , 1997 ; Reubold et al . , 2015 ) and helical polymers around membrane tubes ( Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ) . In these polymers , the GTPase ( G ) domains of adjacent dynamin helix rungs interact , increasing dynamin ' s GTPase activity 1000 fold ( Stowell et al . , 1999 ) . Constriction of the dynamin helix is required for membrane fission ( Antonny et al . , 2016 ) , but how the GTPase activity is coupled to constriction is still debated . The disassembly model proposes that dynamin assembles into a highly constricted helix in the GTP - loaded state , and that GTP - hydrolysis dependent disassembly promotes fission ( Shnyrova et al . , 2013 ) . In the constriction / ratchet model , dynamin GTPase domains are proposed to act as motor heads that use GTP hydrolysis to drive relative displacement of helical turns and thereby decrease the dynamin helix perimeter to constrict the underlying membrane tube . Spontaneous fission then takes place at the edge of the constricted tube due to thermal fluctuations ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . 2 In the cell , dynamin is recruited to endocytic vesicle necks just before fission ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . The dynamin - binding N - BAR proteins are proposed to participate in this recruitment ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . N - BAR proteins are a subfamily of the crescent - shaped BIN1 / Amphiphysin / Rvs167 ( BAR ) proteins ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) with an additional N - terminal amphipathic helix . N - BAR proteins sense and induce membrane curvature ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Mim et al . , 2012 ; Sorre et al . , 2012 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ) , and are thus proposed to either induce or bind avidly to the highly curved necks of endocytic pits . The SH3 domain of N - BAR binds to dynamin ' s proline - rich domain ( PRD ) ( Grabs et al . , 1997 ; Ringstad et al . , 1997 ) recruiting dynamin to vesicle necks ( Sundborger et al . , 2011 ) . However , the role of N - BAR proteins in membrane fission is still unclear . The N - terminal alpha - helix induces membrane curvature , and thus promotes constriction and possibly fission ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ) . On the other hand , the BAR domain is proposed to act as a stable scaffold , blocking further constriction below its preferred curvature and thereby inhibiting fission ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ) . The role of N - BAR proteins in dynamin - mediated membrane fission is even more unclear : amphiphysin was proposed to enhance dynamin - mediated membrane fission ( Takei et al . , 1999 ) , a stimulatory effect found to be curvature - dependent later ( Yoshida et al . , 2004 ) . Early findings showed that endophilin inhibited dynamin - mediated membrane fission ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ) . However , different results were obtained in other assays ( Meinecke et al . , 2013 ; Neumann and Schmid , 2013 ) . In some cases , N - BAR proteins were found to inhibit the GTPase activity of dynamin , but still stimulated its fission reaction ( Neumann and Schmid , 2013 ) . Because of the large variability of published results , we ought to test the effect of the endophilin / dynamin interaction onto the fission rate of dynamin . We employed different membrane templates to measure fission rates and efficiencies of the endophilin - dynamin co - complex and EM to visualise the structures of the co - complex . 3 MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Guanosine 5′ - triphosphate ( GTP , 10106399001 ) was purchased from Roche Diagnostics GmBH , Mannheim , Germany .

COOH - coated beads ( 120 nm or 320 nm diameter , PC02N ) were purchased from Bangs Laboratories , Fishers , USA . Streptavidin - coated beads ( SVP - 30 - 5 ) were purchased from Spherotech , Lake Forest , USA . 4 Dynamin purification Human dynamin 1 was purified from baculovirus - infected Sf9 cells expressing recombinant dynamin 1 , via affinity purification with the SH3 domain of rat amphiphysin 1 ( Stowell et al . , 1999 ) . Typically , 2 l of Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus and incubated under agitation for 3 days . The cell lysate was resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A ( 20 mM HEPES , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , pH 7 . 4 ) + protease inhibitor tablets ( cOmplete EDTA - free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail , 05056489001 , Roche Diagnostics GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) . After homogenisation and centrifugation , the supernatant was incubated under agitation for 2 h at 4 °C with 5 ml glutathione Sepharose beads ( Glutathione Sepharose 4B , 17 - 0756 - 05 , GE Healthcare Bio - Sciences AB , Uppsala , Sweden ) to which 10 mg of GST - tagged amphiphysin 1 - SH3 domain had been attached . After three washes with buffer A , the bead suspension was loaded into a column and the protein eluted with high salt buffer B ( 20 mM PIPES , 1 . 2 M NaCl , 1 mM DTT , pH 6 . 5 ) . The protein positive fractions were pooled , dialysed against GTPase buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 4 ) and concentrated on an Amicon 50 kDa column ( Merck Millipore Ltd . , Carrigtwohill , Ireland ) . Purification of endophilin constructs Rat endophilin A1 was produced from a pGEX - 6P vector in E . coli upon induction with IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C . The pellet was resuspended in PBS + 1 % Triton X - 100 + cOmplete protease inhibitor tablets ( see above ) . The 50 ml supernatant after sonication and centrifugation was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 7 . 5 ml glutathione Sepharose beads ( ABT , Miami , USA ) . Following two washes with cleavage buffer ( 50 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , pH 7 . 5 ) , PreScission enzyme was added to cut off the endophilin from 5 the column , while the GST tag remains attached . The incubation was over night at 4 °C with agitation . Protein positive fractions of the flow through were pooled , concentrated on a Vivaspin 6 10 kDa column ( Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH , Göttingen , Germany ) and dialysed against GTPase buffer . The plasmids for the SH3 and BAR domains of endophilin were a kind gift of Pietro De Camilli ( Yale University ) . The BAR domain was purified like full - length endophilin , apart from the PreScission treatment which was done in solution , prior to adding the suspension to a column . The SH3 domain was purified similarly to full - length endophilin , but with the following differences : the protein production with IPTG was performed only during 2 h ; the SH3 domain was eluted from the beads on a column by addition of glutathione ; only then the GST - tag was cut off from the SH3 domain by PreScission treatment ; a second incubation with glutathione Sepharose beads followed to remove free GST and PreScission which also contained a GST - tag . Protein labelling Fluorescent dynamin was obtained by labelling with Atto 488 iodoacetamide ( AD 488 - 111 , ATTO - TEC GmbH , Siegen , Germany ) at a molar ratio of 1 : 3 ( protein vs . label ) , following the manufacturer ' s labelling protocol . Half fluorescently labelled and half non - labelled dynamin was used in fluorescence microscopy . Endophilin and endophilin ' s BAR domain were labelled with Atto 390 NHS - ester ( AD 390 - 31 , see above ) at a molar ratio of 1 : 3 . In some cases , endophilin was labelled with Atto 390 iodoacetamide ( AD 390 - 111 ) or Atto 565 iodoacetamide ( AD 565 - 111 ; membrane sheets colocalisation ) . 6 Vesicle preparation Three different membrane compositions were used for unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) in the tube - pulling experiments , each of these supplemented with 0 . 03 % DSPE - PEG ( 2000 ) Biotin to allow binding to the streptavidin - coated bead : 28 . 5 % DOPC , 28 . 5 % DOPE , 20 % DOPS , 9 % Brain PIP 2 , 13 % cholesterol , 1 % TMR - PIP 2 ( 3321 , Fig . 2 ) ; 80 % EPC + 19 % PIP 2 + 1 % TMR - PIP 2 ( 80 : 20 , Fig . 3 ) ; 29 % DOPC , 29 % DOPE , 11 % DOPS , 17 % Brain PIP 2 , 13 % cholesterol , 1 % TMR - PIP 2 ( 3312 , Fig . 4 ) . Percentages are mole percentages . For preparing GUVs , 10 - 15 µl lipid mix of 1 - 2 g / l lipids in pure chloroform were deposited on 2 indium tin oxide ( ITO ) coated slides and dried for 1 h at 55 °C . A chamber was assembled with a teflon O - ring between the two slides and it was filled with ~ 400 µl sucrose of 200 - 230 mOsm ( adjusted ± 1 mOsm to the respective experimental buffer ) . The GUVs were electroformed by applying sinus voltage of 1 V at 10 Hz for 1 h at 55 °C . SUVs for electron microscopy ( EM ) were prepared by premixing lipid stocks stored in chloroform into the correct molar ratios . The mixtures were then placed into a 5 mL reaction vial ( TS - 13223 , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA USA ) and the lipids were dried onto the glass surface by vortexing over a stream of Nitrogen gas . Lipids were then reconstituted in 0 . 2 mL Hexane , followed by the same vortex drying procedure , to obtain an evenly dried lipid coat on the reaction vial . The samples were lyophilized for > 1 hour to remove any residual solvent . Lipid mixtures were then reconstituted in GTPase buffer to make a final SUV solution of 1 mg / mL . The sample mixed 12 - 16 hours in a tube rotator to fully reconstitute the lipids from the side of the glass reaction vial . The samples were then subjected to 5 freeze thaw cycles to burst any multi - lamellar liposomes . SUV compositions were either 28 % DOPC , 28 % DOPE , 11 % DOPS , 17 % PIP 2 , 15 % cholesterol or 80 % DOPC , 20 % PIP 2 ( molar % ) . 7 SUVs for the GTPase assay were made by drying 200 µl 10 g / l chloroform solution of 95 % BPL and 5 % Brain PIP 2 in a glass vial with a nitrogen flow . The lipids were rehydrated in 1 ml GTPase buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h , followed by vortexing and sonication . Membrane sheets assay A lipid solution of 10 mg / ml containing 26 % Brain PE , 4 . 5 % Liver PI , 26 % POPS , 30 . 5 % POPC and 13 % cholesterol was prepared , which was then supplemented with 5 % final Brain PIP 2 . Glass cover slips were cleaned with chloroform . Droplets of 1 . 5 μl of above lipid solution were deposited on the cover slip , allowed to dry , and then dried in the vacuum oven for at least one hour . A chamber of ~ 25µl was built by placing the coverslip onto a glass slide , the dried lipid drops facing the glass slide , using a double - sided Scotch ( 3M ) tape as a spacer ( see Fig . 2 in Itoh et al . ( 2005 ) ) . The lipids were fully re - hydrated by injecting 25 μl of 4 g / l casein in GTPase buffer . Rehydration generated membrane sheets , as previously described ( Suzuki and Masuhara , 2005 ) . The glass slide was placed on the stage of either an Axiovert 200 ZEISS ( Germany ) microscope for observation with a JAI Pulnix ( USA ) TM1400CL camera and DVR software ( Advanced Digital Vision Inc . USA ) , or an inverted spinning disk confocal microscope ( Nikon Eclipse T1 with spinning disk from 3I , Denver , CO , USA ) with a 100x oil objective ( Nikon CFI Apo TIRF 100x NA 1 . 4 ) . To generate tubules coated with both endophilin and dynamin , endophilin was added to the chamber with a molar excess of at least 4 times compared to dynamin ( typically 16 µM ) . Then , 5 μl of a dynamin containing solution ( typically 4 µM ) were applied to one side of the chamber and the deformation of membrane sheets produced by its diffusion into the chamber under Differential Interference Contrast ( DIC ) settings . 5 μl of 1 mM GTP containing buffer were added after formation of the tubules . 8 For experiments involving COOH - coated beads ( negatively charged at neutral pH , 320 nm diameter , Bangs Labs , USA ) , beads were diluted 500 - 1000 fold in the dynamin solution prior to injection . Only tubules not adherent to the glass surface throughout their length were selected for observation . Bead rotation analysis For the analysis of the bead movement , movies were contrasted using virtualdub , transformed to 8 bit grayscale stack ( . stk ) files using the ImageJ software , and the spinning beads were tracked using the Tracking Function of the Metamorph software ( Molecular Devices Corp . , USA ) . For each tubule type , the average maximal angular speed was calculated from the maximal speeds ( which in turn was an average of at least three turns ) of 15 to 30 beads . Tube pulling assay A ~ 2 mm high chamber was assembled between two rectangular horizontal glass slides and mounted on the stage of an inverted scanning confocal microscope ( Eclipse T1 with A1R scanner , Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) with a 100x oil objective ( CFI Plan Apo VC 100X Oil NA 1 . 4 , Nikon , see above ) . The microscopy setup included home - made optical tweezers , for which an ytterbium fibre laser ( IPG Photonics , Oxford , USA ) was focussed through the microscopy objective . The chamber was pre - treated with 4 g / l casein in GTPase buffer and then filled by capillarity with a mixture of GTPase buffer and ( 0 . 02 % ( v / v ) ) streptavidin coated beads of 3 . 05 µm average diameter . A GUV was aspirated by a glass pipette ( Fig . 2A ) which was controlled by a micromanipulator ( MP - 225 , Sutter Instrument , Novato , USA ) . A streptavidin coated bead was hold by the optical tweezers , and a nanotube pulled from this bead by first touching it with the GUV and then pulling the GUV away . Time - lapse imaging was started 9 and the protein ( s ) in GTPase buffer , in some cases together with GTP , injected with a second micropipette that was controlled by a manual micromanipulator ( Narishige , Tokyo , Japan ) . In some experiments , a third micropipette was used for injection of a different protein mixture , controlled by a third micromanipulator ( MP - 285 , Sutter , see above ) . GTPase assay We used the malachite green assay to monitor the release of inorganic phosphate due to the GTPase activity of dynamin ( Quan and Robinson , 2005 ) . GTPase activity was measured in the presence of SUVs containing 95 % BPL and 5 % Brain PIP 2 ( see Vesicle Preparation for details on preparation ) . All mixes were performed on the same 96 - well plate , and a molar ratio of approximately four between endophilin and dynamin was used . The assay was performed in a total reaction volume of 50 µl , containing typically 200 nM dynamin ( plus eventually 800 nM endophilin ) , 2 µl SUVs and 100 µM GTP . The buffer of the reaction was GTPase buffer . Incubation prior to addition of malachite working solution was for 30 min at 37 °C . Image analysis Image analysis was performed with ImageJ . Matlab was used to make fits . Membrane remodelling reactions for electron microscopy Purified protein reagents and unilamellar liposomes were mixed together and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes . To generate the homo or hetero polymers of dynamin and endophilin , protein was added to a final concentration of 4 µM mixed with the appropriate nucleotide to a final concentration of 1 mM . Reaction buffer was GTPase buffer . The protein to lipid ratio was 1 : 2 by mass . Remodelled membranes in many cases could be 10 observed by TEM within 5 min of the assembly reaction and were observed at protein concentrations as low as 0 . 5 µM . Negative stain electron microscopy Protein remodelled membranes were prepared for TEM following established procedures ( Booth et al . , 2011 ) . Continuous carbon grids ( 400 mesh copper ) were prepared by glow - discharging the surface ( PELCO EasiGlow , 15 mA , 0 . 39 mBar , 30 seconds ) . Each sample ( 5 µL ) was allowed to absorb onto the grid surface for 2 min followed by blotting onto filter paper . The grids were then stained with 0 . 75 % ( w / v ) uranyl formate for 30 sec , blotted , and allowed to air dry . Samples were imaged with a Tecnai T12 microscope ( FEI ) equipped with a LaB6 filament and operated at 120 kV and data captured with a Gatan Ultrascan CCD camera ( Gatan ) . Cryogenic Electron microscopy Membrane remodelled protein reactions were applied to a glow - discharged ( PELCO EasiGlow , 15 mA , 0 . 39 mBar , 30 seconds ) Quantifoil holey carbon grid ( 2 µm holes , 2 µm spacing , 200 mesh ) in a Vitrobot Mark III ( FEI ) . Specifically , 3 . 5 µL of sample was applied in a 100 % humidity 19 °C chamber , allowed to absorb to the grid surface for 30 sec , blotted against filter paper for 1 . 5 - 4 . 5 sec ( 0 mm offset ) , and then plunge frozen into liquid ethane . Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until imaging could take place ( Grassucci et al . , 2007 ) . Electron cryo - micrographs were collected using standard low - dose procedures 11 RESULTS Endophilin inhibits dynamin - mediated fission ( FIGURE 1 ) In order to study the effect of endophilin on dynamin - mediated fission , lipid tubules were generated from hydrated membrane sheets with these proteins ( see Methods ) . As membrane sheets are a low tension membrane reservoir , curvature - inducing proteins ( such as dynamin and endophilin ) deform them into tubular structures ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) . Once formed , membrane sheets were thus incubated either with dynamin alone ( Fig . 1A ) or sequentially with first endophilin and then dynamin ( Fig . 1B ) . The endophilin - dynamin tubules looked thicker and more contrasted under Differential Interference Contrast ( DIC ) microscopy , probably reflecting the co - assembly of endophilin and dynamin . Indeed , by using fluorescently labelled proteins ( see Fig . 1D ) , we observed that these proteins where co - assembled onto the tubules . GTP was then added ( t = 0 sec ) and videos of the dynamin and endophilin - dynamin tubules were recorded . While the dynamin tubules underwent fission within a few seconds , the endophilin - dynamin tubules did not break . We concluded from these experiment that endophilin was inhibiting dynamin - mediated membrane fission . To further investigate this inhibiting function , we tested dynamin activity in the presence of endophilin in several functional assays . As previously reported ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ) , dynamin ' s GTPase activity was decreased in the presence of endophilin , as measured by malachite green assay ( Fig . 1C ) . We further tested if dynamin still underwent GTP hydrolysis - driven mechano - chemical constriction in the presence of endophilin by visualizing the rotation of beads attached to dynamin - coated lipid tubules after addition of GTP into the chamber ( Roux et al . , 2006 ) . As previously shown , beads rotated with an average speed of 8 - 9 rotations / second when dynamin alone was used , whereas no rotation 12 was observed in the presence of endophilin ( Fig . 1E , F ) . These results suggested that endophilin blocked dynamin constriction – thereby reducing its GTPase activity – and inhibiting membrane fission . Endophilin reduces fission rate and efficiency in a concentration - dependent manner ( FIGURE 2 ) To better characterize and define the required molecular interactions for this fission inhibition , we used an assay that enabled us to measure the rate of dynamin - mediated membrane fission ( Fig . 2A ) . A giant unilamellar vesicle ( GUV ) was held under aspiration into a glass micropipette , and a lipid nanotube was pulled out from the GUV by means of optical tweezers ( Methods and Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . Dynamin , endophilin and GTP were injected in the proximity of the membrane tube via separate injection pipettes allowing for various sequences of injection during time - lapse confocal imaging . The fission time – which is the inverse of the fission rate – was defined as the time between the start of the injection and the breakage of the tube ( Fig . 2C ) . We measured fission times and plotted cumulative probability curves for various endophilin / dynamin molar concentration ratios , with a constant concentration of dynamin of 5 µM . Exponential fits to a * ( 1 - exp ( - t / τ ) ) ( Matlab ) revealed the fission efficiency ( a ) and characteristic time ( τ ) for each condition , incl . 95 % confidence intervals for the two fit parameters . Fission efficiency a corresponds to the percentage of tubes that are not cut . At low ratios ( 0 . 5x / 1x ) , fission still took place in most cases , but was delayed ( 39 . 5 ± 3 . 8 sec and 52 . 8 ± 7 . 8 sec , respectively , compared to 15 . 8 ± 3 . 7 sec for dynamin alone ; Fig . 2E , F , G ) . At high endophilin ratios ( 4x ) , where both dynamin and endophilin clearly bound to the tube ( Fig . 2D ) , fission was completely inhibited ( Fig . 2E , F , G ) . 13 To test whether direct interactions between dynamin and endophilin , and endophilin and the membrane were required for this inhibition , we tested the effect of endophilin ' s BAR and SH3 domains on dynamin fission rates and efficiency at the highest ( 4x ) concentration ratio ( Fig . 2B ) . No difference in fission efficiency was observed for the SH3 domain ( Fig . 2H , I ) . By contrast , the BAR domain alone , a known curvature inducer ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ) , significantly decreased the fission rate ( Fig . 2H , J ) , while fission efficiency was only slightly reduced ( Fig . 2H , I ) by comparison with full length endophilin ( 4x ) ( Fig . 2H , I ) . As changing the endophilin / dynamin ratio affects the total protein concentration in solution , we wondered how the inhibitory effect of endophilin was affected by the total protein concentration . Instead of keeping the dynamin concentration constant , we measured fission times for solutions where the total protein concentration was kept constant at 5 µM , adjusting the dynamin and endophilin concentrations according to the required final ratio . In this case , the inhibitory effect was also present , even though slightly less pronounced than when the dynamin concentration was kept constant at 5 µM ( Fig . 2H , I , J ) . As changing the concentrations of dynamin and endophilin affects their ability to bind on these membrane tubules ( Roux et al . , 2010 ; Sorre et al . , 2012 ) , these experiments may not reach the exact same endophilin / dynamin ratio on the tube than for experiments where dynamin concentration was kept constant . Endophilin is binding to membrane between dynamin rings and dynamin is further apart in copolymer We next wondered by which mechanism endophilin inhibited dynamin ' s fission activity . One possibility would be the observed downregulation of the GTPase activity of dynamin by endophilin ( Yoshida et al . ( 2004 ) ; Fig . 1C ) . At the same time , the distance between turns of dynamin is increased by a factor of 2 in the presence of endophilin , as seen by electron 14 microscopy ( EM ) ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ) . We thus hypothesised that the change in the coat structure might be due to the intercalation of endophilin between the dynamin rings , blocking molecular interactions between GTPase domains that are thought to be responsible for enhanced GTPase activity and constriction . However , currently available EM images do not have enough resolution to distinguish BAR domain proteins in between the turns of the dynamin helix . We thus prepared samples for cryo - EM , hoping that the higher resolution would resolve the relevant molecular interactions . . Dynamin alone , endophilin alone or various mixtures were incubated with liposomes . As previously reported ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ) , apparent turns of Dynamin were space further apart in the co - complex than in the sample with dynamin alone ( Fig . 3A ) . Asymmetric units of the co - complex from cryo - EM micrographs were extracted for further analysis by classification and class averaging ( Supplemental Figure 1A ) . In those images projected perpendicularly to the axis of the BAR domain , endophilin appeared as a triangular shape bound to the membrane tube ( see Fig . 3B ) . Dynamin appeared as a T - shaped structure , consistent with previous images in which the tips of the T - shape correspond with the GTPase domains and the body of the T - shape corresponds with the dimeric stalk ( Chappie et al . , 2010 ; Zhang and Hinshaw , 2001 ) . In the co - complex , raw micrographs and class averages show that endophilin molecules are intercalated in between the dynamin rings ( Fig . 3B ) , clearly separating the GTPase domains . Most of the asymmetric units were found to belong to one of two classes with either 2 or 3 endophilin molecules separating turns of dynamin ( Fig . 2E ) . As there are about 28 monomers of dynamin per helical turn ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Zhang and Hinshaw , 2001 ) , and between 8 - 16 monomers of endophilin ( Mim et al . , 2012 ) , dynamin could recruit enough endophilin to form up to 2 - 3 turns . From these results we concluded that when endophilin and dynamin are both bound to the membrane and to each other through their PRD - SH3 domains , endophilin is inserted 15 between turns of a dynamin oligomer . In this arrangement , the dynamin molecules from adjacent turns are sufficiently far apart that they are unable to interact , inhibiting G domain dimerization and GTP hydrolysis - driven constriction Endophilin reduces dynamin signal on tube , correlating with fission inhibition ( FIGURE 4 ) Following the observations that endophilin was inhibitory for fission ( Fig . 1 , 2 ) and that it inserted in between the turns of the dynamin helix ( Fig . 3B ) , we hypothesized that the insertion and alternated coat architecture was responsible for fission inhibition . To test this hypothesis , we looked for a way to monitor fission rate as a function of dynamin density on the tube , assuming that a reduction of the dynamin density would reflect insertion of endophilin within the dynamin coat . Thus , we used the tube pulling assay , and tubes were decorated by co - injection of dynamin and endophilin ( Fig . 4A ) . The formation of the co - complex was assessed by measuring the fluorescence signals of both proteins , and then GTP was injected onto the same tube to measure the fission time . The dynamin signal was clearly lower when endophilin was co - injected , as compared to dynamin alone ( Fig . 4B , C , D ) , showing that endophilin was intercalating within the dynamin coat . The endophilin signal on the tube was , as expected , increasing with increasing endophilin concentrations in solution ( Fig . 4E ) . The lower dynamin fluorescence was in agreement with the changes in dynamin density in the co - polymer observed by EM ( Fig . 3B ) . Fission activity was dramatically reduced on tubes with the endophilin - dynamin co - complex , whereas it proceeded normally on tubes coated with dynamin only ( Fig . 4F ) . Our results thus support that the endophilin intercalation directly caused the fission inhibition . 16 DISCUSSION In this study , we have tested the effect of endophilin on dynamin ' s membrane fission activity . Our results show that a 4x molar excess of endophilin inhibits fission completely and decreases dynamin ' s GTPase activity . We measured fission rates and efficiencies for different endophilin - dynamin molar ratios , and concluded that the inhibition was not only a time delay but also a decrease in fission efficiency until complete blockage . Deletion construct experiments indicated that both endophilin ' s membrane binding and direct dynamin binding properties were required for full inhibition . EM images and class averaging visualised the endophilin - dynamin co - complex , where 2 to 3 turns of endophilin bind to the membrane between the dynamin rungs in the endophilin - dynamin co - complex . This explained the increased dynamin pitch that had been observed earlier on blocked elongated vesicle necks ( Iversen et al . , 2003 ; Takei et al . , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1995 ) . Fission inhibition was found to be coupled to pitch elongation as the dynamin fluorescence intensity decreased 2‒3 fold on the endophilin - dynamin co - polymer blocked for fission , consistently with the ~ 2 fold pitch increase between the dynamin rungs observed by EM . Our results support the following model : While the adjacent dynamin rings in the helix interact , which is needed for the stimulation of GTPase activity and constriction ( Fig . 4G ) , endophilin prevents the formation of long 1 - start helices of dynamin with many inter - rung interactions between G domains in trans . Rather , when endophilin binds dynamin and the membrane of the tubule , dynamin appears unable to form the multi - turn helical coat . In the hybrid coat of the co - polymer , the BAR domains of endophilin are preventing the G - domains of adjacent dynamin dimers from interacting ( Fig . 4H ) . As both GTPase activity and GTP hydrolysis - driven constriction would therefore be inhibited , fission is blocked in the co - polymer . Interestingly , all known BAR , N - BAR and F - BAR partners of dynamin have been shown to change the architecture of the dynamin coat in similar ways when co - assembled 17 on membrane tubules ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) . This observation and our results suggest that all BAR , N - BAR and F - BAR proteins with SH3 domains that bind the PRD domain of dynamin can potentially inhibit membrane fission by inserting of their BAR domain between the dynamin helical turns . Endophilin has previously been proposed to recruit dynamin to vesicle necks ( Shupliakov , 1997 ; Sundborger et al . , 2011 ; Wigge et al . , 1997 ) . According to our and previous findings ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ) , this endophilin - dynamin co - complex would , on the other hand , not allow for fission . Strikingly , all endocytic events blocked at the dynamin stage show a dynamin polymer with an elongated pitch . This suggests that dynamin , as it co - assembles with endophilin ( Wu et al . , 2010 ) at clathrin coated pits , is primarily assembled into an constriction - inhibited polymer . Endophilin and the other endocytic proteins could prepare the vesicle neck for fission , by decreasing the diameter of the neck and by recruiting dynamin , but fission would not be possible yet . Release of the inhibition could occur by phosphorylation of the PRD domain of dynamin upon an intracellular Ca 2 + increase , which decreases the affinity between dynamin ' s PRD and endophilin and might cause endophilin to be released from dynamin ( Chen - Hwang et al . , 2002 ) . It is unclear though whether the phosphorylation of the PRD of dynamin is possible when it is bound to endophilin ' s SH3 domain . At least when amphiphysin , another N - BAR protein , was present , the phosphorylation of dynamin ' s PRD was inhibited ( Tan et al . , 2003 ) . Also the increased Ca 2 + concentration itself is proposed to induce an intramolecular bridge within endophilin , where its SH3 domain binds to another part of the endophilin molecule causing its release from the PRD of dynamin ( Chen et al . , 2003 ) . The question remains whether the dissociation of the SH3 domain from the PRD of dynamin is enough to release endophilin from the vesicle neck . Another possibility would be the phosphorylation of the BAR domain of endophilin by LRRK2 , which was shown to reduce endophilin ' s membrane binding properties ( Matta et al . , 18 2012 ) . We speculate that this could be one reason why the kinase activity of LRRK2 is important for synaptic vesicle endocytosis ( Arranz et al . , 2015 ) . It is also still unclear whether all other BAR proteins present at the neck have to undergo the same inhibition release mechanism . 19 REFERENCES Antonny , B . , Burd , C . , De Camilli , P . , Chen , E . , Daumke , O . , Faelber , K . , Ford , M . , Frolov , V .

Diﬀerent membrane templates and assays were used to study the eﬀect on ﬁssion . Treating tubules coated either with dynamin alone or the endophilin - dynamin co - complex with GTP indicated generally that the co - complex did not induce membrane ﬁssion . The malachite green assay indicated that dynamin had a reduced GTPase activity in the co - complex . Attaching beads to dynamin or endophilin - dynamin coated membrane tubules and monitoring the bead rotation upon GTP injection visualised that the co - complex was apparently not able to constrict . The nanotube pulling assay was used to measure ﬁssion eﬃciencies and rates for diﬀerent molecular ratios of endophilin and dynamin in the co - complex . In a condition with 4x more endophilin , ﬁssion was completely blocked , whereas dynamin alone would induce ﬁssion of all tubes within a few tens of seconds . Experiments with endophilin’s BAR or SH3 domains alone indicated that the binding between endophilin and dynamin as well as membrane binding or scaﬀolding via the BAR domain were required for complete ﬁssion inhibition . A collaboration with Nathaniel Talledge and Adam Frost from the University of California San Francisco ( UCSF ) made it possible to visualise the endophilin - dynamin co - complex on membrane tubes by electron microscopy . The previously obtained results of a dynamin pitch increase in the co - complex were conﬁrmed , but especially , the better resolution 3D averages from cryo electron microscopy showed that 2 or 3 lines of endophilin intercalated between the dynamin helix turns in the co - polymer . The 3D averages also showed that the GTPase domains of adjacent helix turns likely do not interact in the co - polymer because they are too far away . This was striking , because it allowed to make a hypothesis for the ﬁssion inhibition in the co - complex with a clear prediction : If the dynamin helix turns are further apart in the co - complex , then the dynamin ﬂuorescence signal on tubes from the nano tube pulling assay should be reduced in the co - complex . This was measured and found to be true . The reduction in dynamin signal was 2 – 3 fold . To link this information with ﬁssion , the tubes with diﬀerent endophilin - dynamin ratios and which had served for the measurements were then subjected to GTP treatment to measure ﬁssion rates , and indeed ﬁssion was blocked in 90 % of the tubes that had were covered with the co - polymer and where the dynamin signal was reduced . These results conﬁrmed the hypothesis and allowed to propose the following model : Fission is inhibited in the co - complex because endophilin inserts between the dynamin helix turns and pushes them so far apart that the GTPase domains cannot interact , hence cannot constrict , and therefore cannot mediate membrane ﬁssion . 4 . 4 Complementary Experiments 4 . 4 . 1 Injection Of Endophilin On Pre - Formed Dynamin Polymers Having added a third micromanipulator to the nanotube pulling setup , I also had the possi - bility to observe protein binding when both proteins ( dynamin and endophilin ) were injected 72 Thesis Work : Endophilin Inhibits Dynamin - Mediated Fission FIGURE 3 A B Kymograph 2 : Dynamin + endophilin on 80 : 20 tube 20141210 _ 009 5µM dynamin , 5 µM endophilin + 15µM GTP , master mix Sep 2014 ( 3 months old ) , white scale bar 5µm , black scale bar 1 min - Dynamin expansion from endophilin - dynamin copolymer possible during second injection of dynamin ( downfacing arrows ) - Dynamin signal did NOT increase upon endophilin injection ( top arrow ; no dynamin was in solution anymore when endophilin was injected ) . - Dynamin polymer length did NOT increase upon endophilin injection = > No evidence from this that endophilin is able to push apart the dynamin helix here - Aspect of some Dynamin polymers changed upon injection of endophilin ( + GTP ) , see lower upfacing arrow . - Fission took place .

White scale bar , 5 µ m . Black scale bar , 1 min . sequentially . Having observed an increased distance between dynamin turns in the co - polymer with endophilin ( Article 2 ) and Farsad et al . ( 2001 ) ) , we wanted to test whether endophilin was also able to insert between turns of a pre - formed dynamin polymer and push them apart . In experiments presented in Article 2 , endophilin had been co - injected with dynamin in the tube - pulling setup . The used lipid composition permitted dynamin to form a limited number of nucleation spots , well spread over the tube , allowing to distinguish areas of the membrane tube coated with dynamin and ones that are not ( 80 % EPC , 19 % Brain PIP 2 , 1 % red ﬂuorescent PIP 2 ; Morlot et al . ( 2012 ) ) . After formation of nuclei on the tube ( Figure 4 . 1A , downfacing arrows ) , endophilin was injected with a second injection pipette . Note the growing polymers when dynamin is injected ( Figure 4 . 1A , four downward facing ar - rows ) . The dynamin polymer did not increase in length upon endophilin binding ( Figure 4 . 1A , left arrow , Figure 4 . 1B , upward facing arrow ) . Dynamin polymerized from several new nucle - ation sites upon endophilin injection ( Figure 4 . 1B , four downfacing arrowheads ) . Moreover , the dynamin intensity increased upon endophilin injection ( Figure 4 . 1A , left arrow ) , probably because dynamin was still in solution at this time point in the experiment in Figure 4 . 1A , and could bind to newly attached endophilin layer . Indeed , this was not observed when dynamin was fully removed before endophilin was injected ( Figure 4 . 1B , upper upward facing arrow ) . The aspect of some dynamin polymers changed upon injection of endophilin + GTP ( upfacing arrow , Figure 4 . 1B ) . Importantly , endophilin bound to existing dynamin polymers only ( Figure 4 . 1A , asterisk ) and not to the membrane tube on its own , it was therefore likely recruited by dynamin . We could not conclude from these experiments that endophilin was able to push apart the turns of a pre - existing dynamin polymer , as no decrease of dynamin ﬂuorescence nor increase of the dynamin polymer length were observed . On the other hand , endophilin did not bind to the membrane in regions without dynamin . Given the low aﬃnity of endophilin for this membrane composition and the absence of a length increase of the dynamin polymer upon endophilin binding , it seemed likely that endophilin did not actually bind to the membrane in the regions where it was recruited by dynamin . Instead , endophilin could have created a second layer on top 4 . 4 Complementary Experiments 73 of dynamin and the recruitement to the tube proximity was solely by the interaction between dynamin’s PRD domain and endophilin’s SH3 domain . It therefore seemed well possible that the protein behaviour of this experiment would be diﬀerent with a membrane composition to which endophilin binds on its own . 4 . 4 . 2 Assessment Of Fission Inhibition Of Endophilin Without Binding To The Membrane In the previous section ( 4 . 4 . 1 ) , the binding of dynamin and endophilin was observed when both proteins were injected sequentially on membrane nanotubes . It had been observed that endophilin bound to pre - formed dynamin polymers without pushing them apart . We asked the question whether binding of endophilin to dynamin , potentially without binding to the mem - brane , was still inhibiting membrane ﬁssion . As we did not have at our disposal an experimental setup with four pipettes ( resulting in three available injection pipettes ) , we designed the fol - lowing experiment , with a membrane tube with the membrane composition from Section 4 . 4 . 1 as a starting point : 1 . Simultaneous injection of 20 µ M endophilin , 5 µ M dynamin and 150 µ M GTP . 2 . a ) Injection of 20 µ M endophilin . b ) Simultaneous injection of 5 µ M dynamin and 150 µ M GTP . If endophilin binding to dynamin without binding to the membrane was not inhibitory for ﬁssion , ﬁssion should occur independently of the endophilin layer . The cumulative ﬁssion probability curve should resemble the obtained from injecting Dynamin + GTP ( Figure 4 . 2A , turquoise – Endo curve ) . In this case we would proceed with 2a ) to show that endophilin was not able to bind to the tube alone . We would do this because the membrane composition of GUVs from the same preparation still varies in exact percentages . If , on the other hand , endophilin binding to dynamin without binding to the membrane was inhibitory , a rather drastic eﬀect was expected , as ﬁssion is completely blocked when using these protein and GTP concentrations on a membrane composition where both proteins clearly bind to the membrane tube on their own ( Article 2 , Figure 2E , F , G ) . In this case , we would proceed with 2b ) to show that the exact same tube was ﬁssion - competent in the absence of endophilin . Figure 4 . 2A shows the outcome of the experiment . The data points were ﬁt to a ( 1 − e − t τ ) using Matlab . Injecting endophilin + dynamin + GTP did not induce ﬁssion ( n = 5 , Figure 4 . 2A , dark red + Endo ( 4x ) curve ) , suggesting that endophilin was inhibitory for dynamin - mediated ﬁssion with this lipid composition as well . As endophilin was not detected to bind to the tube outside the dynamin polymers ( Figure 4 . 1 ) , this was surprising . It suggested that apparently the simple binding of endophilin to dynamin , potentially without direct binding to the membrane , completely blocked ﬁssion . The following injection of dynamin + GTP always induced ﬁssion of these tubes ( Figure 4 . 2A , black dashed pre - Endo curve ) , indicating that the tubes were ﬁssion - competent . There was no diﬀerence in ﬁssion rate upon dynamin + GTP , independently of 74 Thesis Work : Endophilin Inhibits Dynamin - Mediated Fission A B before endophilin injection C after 3 minutes of endophilin injection 0 100 200 300 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 Time , s C u m u l a t i ve f i ss i on p r ob a b ili t y − Endo + Endo ( 4x ) pre - Endo Figure 4 . 2 : Fission inhibition by endophilin on membrane composition to which endophilin has low binding aﬃnity .

Scale bar , 5 µ m whether a respective tube had been pre - treated with endophilin + dynamin + GTP or not ( Figure 4 . 2A , dashed black pre - Endo ﬁt curve vs . turquoise – Endo ﬁt curve , respectively ) . Inhibition of ﬁssion by endophilin even without binding to the membrane was surprising . This is why we veriﬁed again that endophilin was not binding to the tube on its own . 20 µ M endophilin + 150 µ M GTP were injected on nanotubes of the same lipid composition . While not having detected endophilin binding to tubes of this composition during the previous experiments on its own , averaging of 10 images after 3 minutes of continuous endophilin + GTP injection now revealed that endophilin was actually binding to nanotubes having this lipid composition ( Figure 4 . 2B , C ) . Binding had not been observed in the previous experiments with the same lipid composition because the binding kinetics were much slower compared to compositions containing PS ( see Article 2 ) . As endophilin was able to slowly bind to the composition used for the experiment presented in Figure 4 . 2 on its own , the ﬁrst hypothesis about ﬁssion inhibition by endophilin without binding to the membrane could not be veriﬁed with this experiment . 4 . 4 . 3 Cloning Of An Endophilin - Dynamin Chimera Plasmid After having observed that endophilin inhibits dynamin - mediated ﬁssion in vitro , we wanted to test inhibition of dynamin - mediated ﬁssion by endophilin in mammalian cells . The idea was to express a chimera protein of endophilin and dynamin in mammalian cells , mimicking a condition in which endophilin is always bound to dynamin . With the help of Carole Seum ( Marcos González - Gaitán lab , University of Geneva ) , a plasmid for mammalian expression was generated using site - directed mutagenesis ( see Figure 4 . 3 ) . The N - terminus of endophilin is an amphipathic helix . In order to not interfere with this helix , the N - BAR domain of endophilin was added to the N terminus of EGFP - Dynamin , resulting in N - BAR - EGFP - Dynamin . The SH3 domain was not included as endophilin and dynamin are linked anyway . In a ﬁrst step , primers of 45 nucleotides ( nt ) were designed where the ﬁrst half was complemen - 4 . 4 Complementary Experiments 75 G F P B A R D y n a m i n pEGFP - C1 pGEX - EndoBAR 45nt primer _ fw megaprimer _ fw mega - primer _ rev Product of 1st PCR E G F P pEGFP - BAR - EGFP - Dyn Product 2nd PCR nick nick 45nt primer _ rev G S T E G F P D y n a m i n B A R 1 2 3 4 Figure 4 . 3 : QuikChange mutagenesis to insert BAR domain into EGFP - dynamin plasmid . tary to the insert , namely the BAR domain of a pGEX - EndoBAR donor vector ( kind gift from Pietro De Camilli , Yale University ) , and the other half to the nucleotides around the site of the receiving vector ( pEGFP - C1 with dynamin inserted at the C terminus of the EGFP ; Pietro de Camilli ) into which the BAR domain was supposed to be inserted ( primer _ fw and primer _ rev in Figure 4 . 3 ) . A PCR with these primers and the donor vector was performed ( 1 ) and the obtained PCR product puriﬁed on an agarose gel ( 2 ) . The single strands of this PCR product now served as megaprimers for a 2 nd PCR with the receiving vector ( 3 ) . The product of this 2 nd PCR is shown in the right of Figure 4 . 3 ( 4 ) . The only diﬀerence to the wanted plasmid are 2 nicks , one in each strand but not at the same position . These nicks are repaired by the bacteria which were transformed with the PCR reaction . As the template of the 2 nd PCR would be selected in these bacteria as well , the solution after the 2 nd PCR is digested with DpnI prior to transformation . DpnI only cuts DNA that is at least hemimethylated . The template is in a methylated state as long as it was produced in the classical dam + dcm + E . coli , while PCR results in demethylated DNA . Therefore , DpnI digestion only digests the template , increasing the probability to obtain clones with the inserted BAR domain after transformation . 4 . 4 . 4 Endophilin - Dynamin Chimera Expression In Mammalian Cells Once the plasmid of the Endophilin - Dynamin Chimera had been obtained , we expressed the chimera in mammalian cells . This experiment was a collaboration with my lab colleague Valentina Galli . HeLa cells were transfected using 0 . 5 – 1 µ g pEGFP - BAR - EGFP - Dyn chimera plasmid ( cloning see Section 4 . 4 . 3 ) or 0 . 5 – 1 µ g human dynamin 1 in pEGFP - C1 ( N - terminal EGFP , kind gift from Pietro de Camilli , Yale University ) with X - tremeGENE HP DNA Trans - fection Reagent ( 06366236001 , Roche Diagnostics GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Images of the cells were acquired on a microscope ( Nikon Eclipse T1 , Nikon Tokyo , Japan ) with a 100x oil objective ( Nikon CFI Apo TIRF 100x NA 1 . 4 ) , either using total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) or a spinning disk ( 3I , Denver , CO , USA ) . In most of the cells , the EGFP - chimera localised mostly to big aggregate - like structures at the cell membrane which were rarely seen in cells expressing EGFP - dynamin ( Figure 4 . 4A , C ) . Such big structures were present only in very few cells with high expression levels of EGFP - dynamin . While a cytosolic signal of EGFP - dynamin was observed of varying intensities in diﬀerent cells , the cytosolic signal of EGFP - chimera was very low . Also EGFP - dynamin partly localised to punctae , but these were smaller . Considering that the chimera contained a BAR domain 76 Thesis Work : Endophilin Inhibits Dynamin - Mediated Fission A C B D EGFP - Dyn EGFP - Chimera EGFP - Dyn EGFP - Chimera Figure 4 . 4 : Expression of an endophilin - dynamin chimera in HeLa cells .

Black scale bar , 1 min that dimerises with other BAR domains , and dynamin that dimerises / tetramerises with other dynamin molecules , the chimera might form polymers either with itself or with other dynamin or endophilin molecules . Cells expressing low levels of EGFP - chimera had small punctae that were indistinguishable from those in EGFP - dynamin expressing cells , for their size , localisation and transient nature ( Figure 4 . 4B , D ) . This suggested that the presence of the chimera on structures resembling endocytic pits did not block these , but did not allow to distinguish between abortive events or indeed ﬁssion . This is why we measured transferrin uptake in these cells ( see next section , 4 . 4 . 5 ) . 4 . 4 . 5 Transferrin Uptake In Mammalian Cells Expressing An Endophilin - Dynamin Chimera The observation that the transient small punctae were indistinguishable between EGFP - dynamin expressing cells and EGFP - chimera expressing cells indicated , ﬁrst of all , that the expressed chimera was not blocked at the vesicle neck . At least , several events were dynamic , similar to EGFP - Dynamin overexpressing cells . On the other hand , it was unclear whether the dis - appearance of the punctae reﬂected membrane ﬁssion – leading to a movement of the vesicle and chimera out of the focussed z - plane or disassembly – or to the abortion of the endocytic pit without vesicle formation and ﬁssion . This is why we tested the transferrin uptake in these cells , as the internalisation of transferrin by the transferrin receptor is an indicator for eﬀective CME . This experiment was done in collaboration with my lab colleague Valentina Galli . 4 . 4 Complementary Experiments 77 A B C D E mCherry / EGFP Transferrin Merge NT Dyn - mCherry EGFP - Dyn EGFP - Chimera N T c h e rr y - D y n G F P - D y n G F P - c h i m e r a 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 F l uo r esce n ce i n t e n s i t y ( a . u . ) n . s . n . s . n . s .

As already observed in Section 4 . 4 . 4 , the chimera mostly formed polymers or aggregates inside the cells and the cytosolic signal was low . It might be that CME was not aﬀected by the expression of the chimera because cytoplasmic levels are drastically reduced by protein aggregation ( see also Section 4 . 4 . 4 ) . Experimental procedures : HeLa cells were transfected as described in the previous section ( 4 . 4 . 4 ) , using 0 . 5 µ g of plasmid DNA . As a control , non - transfected HeLa cells and cells transfected with 0 . 5 µ g mouse dynamin 1 in pmCherry - N1 ( C - terminal mCherry ; kind gift from Christien Merriﬁeld , Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell , Gif sur Yvette ) were used . Cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 647 - conjugated transferrin ( T23366 , Life Technologies , distributed by ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , USA ) for 15 minutes , washed with PBS and ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) . Images of the cells were acquired on a confocal microscope ( Nikon Eclipse T1 , Nikon Tokyo , Japan ) with spinning disk ( 3I , Denver , CO , USA ) with a 100x oil objective ( Nikon CFI Apo TIRF 100x NA 1 . 4 ) . z - stack images in a total range of 10 µ m were acquired and maximum projections obtained with ImageJ . The quantiﬁcation of the ﬂuorescence signal was performed in ImageJ by measuring the mean grey value for the transferrin channel ( far red ) per pixel in the area of the cells . Chapter 5 Thesis Work : Collaboration About The Curvature - Dependence Of The Activity Of Vps34 Complex I 5 . 1 Background Of The Collaboration The experiments described in this section are based on a collaboration with Roger Williams and Ksenia Rostislavleva ( Roger Williams lab ) from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biol - ogy , Cambridge UK . Roger William’s lab studies the lipid kinase Vps34 that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) to phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI ( 3 ) P ) . Vps34 is part of several complexes , among which complex I is involved in autophagy and complex II in endocytic sort - ing , autophagy and cytokinesis ( Figure 5 . 1A ) . Ksenia Rostislavleva had observed that complex I and complex II were similarly active on highly curved membrane templates ( small unilamellar vesicles , SUVs ; Figure 5 . 1B ) , while complex I was not active on low - curvature templates ( GUVs ; Figure 5 . 1C ) . They hypothesised that the activity of complex I , which contains Atg14 whose human homologue ATG14L contains a BATS domain that is known to sense curvature ( Fan et al . , 2011 ) , is dependent on curvature while complex II is not . The goal of the collaboration was to test this hypothesis using the nanotube pulling assay . 5 . 2 The Activity Of Vps34 Complex Depends On The Lipid Saturation Status The ﬁrst part consisted in reproducing the microscopy results on the activity of the complexes on GUVs from Rostislavleva et al . ( 2015 ) , using the material at hand in Geneva . Detection of the activity of the complexes occured ( like in Rostislavleva et al . ( 2015 ) ) by using a ﬂuorescently labelled p40PX domain which speciﬁcally binds to the product of Vps34 complex I / II activity , PI ( 3 ) P ( Kanai et al . , 2001 ) . Buﬀer , ATP and protein concentrations were used as described in Rostislavleva et al . ( 2015 ) . To our surprise , complex I was also active in my experiments on GUVs , not only complex II ( Figure 5 . 2A – B ) . The negative control without complexes revealed 80 Thesis Work : Collaboration About The Curvature - Dependence Of The Activity Of Vps34 Complex I DTT ) and then loaded on a pre - equilibrated 5 ml Heparin HP column . The protein was then eluted with an NaCl gradient ( HEP - B buffer , 2 M NaCl , and 0 . 5 mM DTT ) .

Proteins on IgG beads were incubated overnight with TEV protease in 10 ml of wash 2 buffer at 4°C . After the first elution , 5 ml of wash 2 buffer without TEV protease was added and a second elution was performed . The two TEV elution fractions were combined , and CHAPS was added to a concentration of 0 . 1 % . Protein was concentrated for gel filtration ( Amicon Ultra 100 - kD cutoff , Millipore ) . Gel filtration was carried out on a Superdex20016 / 60 column ( GEHealthcare ) , which was pre - equilibrated with gel - filtration buffer ( 20 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 4 , 300 mM NaCl , and 1 mM TCEP ) . The peak fractions were combined and concentrated to 400 m l at 6 . 3 mg / ml ( 16 m M ) . The whole amount was used for the cross - linking . Complex II at 10 m M was cross - linked using a CovalX K200 stabilization kit ( CovalX , Zurich , Switzerland ) by following the manufacture ’ s proto - col . After removing precipitates by centrifugation , the cross - linked material was frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped on dry ice to the Steyaert laboratory for immunization .

Scale bar , 10 µ m . 82 Thesis Work : Collaboration About The Curvature - Dependence Of The Activity Of Vps34 Complex I that the PX domain signal on the GUVs incubated with complex I was not stemming from a PI ( 3 ) P contamination in the purchased lipids ( Figure 5 . 2C ) , as no signal was detected on the GUV without complexes . We identiﬁed 5 potential diﬀerences in the experimental protocol . For each diﬀerence , the way it was done in Geneva is indicated ﬁrst : 1 . DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / Soy PI were used instead of Brain PC / Brain PE / Brain PS / Liver PI . 2 . Electroformation of GUVs for 1 h at room temperature instead of 4 h at 60 ◦ C . 3 . Home made chamber instead of Lab - Tek II chamber that is ﬁlled from above . 4 . Passivation of the experimental chamber chamber for 15 min with casein instead of 1 h with BSA . 5 . Mixing of GUVs with protein and buﬀer prior to pipetting whole reaction volume into chamber , instead of adding GUVs into chamber ﬁrst , followed by adding the rest of the reaction and mixing by pipetting up and down . After having tried out the diﬀerent parameters , the decisive factor , which also seemed most likely to us to create the diﬀerence from the beginning , were the precise lipids that were used . Dioleoyl ( DO ) lipids ( DOPC / DOPE / DOPS ) contain two double bonds ( 18 : 1 18 : 1 ) , while the brain - extracted equivalents that were used in Cambridge ( Brain PC / Brain PE / Brain PS ) contain a mixture of fatty acids with 0 to 6 double bonds . In general , using lipids without any double bond ( 16 : 0 16 : 0 or 18 : 0 18 : 0 ) resulted in no activity , while complex I was fully active on lipids with a single double bond ( 16 : 0 18 : 1 ) ( unpublished results from Ksenia Rostislavleva ) . Given that the brain lipids contained more fatty acids without double bonds but at the same time more polyunsaturated fatty acids ( 20 : 4 and 22 : 6 ) , the idea came up that the binding or at least activity of complex I is favoured by lipid packing defects ( Pinot et al . , 2014 ) . Monounsaturated fatty acids contribute to creating rather deep lipid - packing defects which make the lipid headgroups more accessible and resemble curved membranes ( Vamparys et al . , 2013 ) , polyunsaturated fatty acids adapt their conformation and can reduce deep packing defects ( Pinot et al . , 2014 ) . 5 . 3 Testing The Curvature - Dependent Activity Of Vps34 Com - plex I With The Nanotube Pulling Assay The initial starting point for the collaboration was to test the hypothesis that arose from the activity diﬀerence of complex I on SUVs compared to GUVs , by injecting Vps34 complex I on a pulled nanotube from the tube pulling assay and to assess whether the activity was higher on the highly - curved nanotube than on the low - curvature GUV , similar to measuring curvature sensing like in Sorre et al . ( 2012 ) . The diﬃculty of our experiment was though that we did not have ﬂuorescently labelled Vps34 complex I components at hand at this time point which would have allowed to detect curvature - dependent binding of the Vps34 complex I . Instead , we would only be able to detect the product of the reaction that is mediated by the complex , namely PI ( 3 ) P . This would therefore not measure curvature - dependent binding alone but curvature - dependent activity which could partially be the result of curvature - dependent binding . In the case of 5 . 3 Testing The Curvature - Dependent Activity Of Vps34 Complex I With The Nanotube Pulling Assay 83 curvature - dependent activity , we expected to obtain a diﬀusion gradient on the nanotube , similar to Ambroggio et al . ( 2010 ) with ArfGAP1 . While in the experiments from Ambroggio et al . ( 2010 ) , ArfGAP1 activity leads to dissociation of Arf1 from the nanotube , resulting in an Arf1 gradient away from the GUV , we would expect a gradient of the PX signal ( revealing PI ( 3 ) P ) along the nanotube away from the bead towards the GUV , followed by accumulation of PX signal . We did not know whether the kinetics of Vps34 Complex I activity were fast enough to allow to observe a gradient on the nanotube before the generated PI ( 3 ) P diﬀused evenly over the nanotube and GUV . As we were not sure about this , we already had an alternative in mind , namely comparing kinetics of PI ( 3 ) P generation on GUVs with tube compared to GUVs without tube , again expecting faster kinetics in the presence of a nanotube in the case of curvature - dependent Vps34 complex I activity . For the tube pulling experiment , the experimental conditions were adapted as follows : • Adjustment of osmolarities of the glucose inside the GUVs , the solution in the chamber and the protein solution that was injected , by decreasing the glucose concentration inside the GUVs and adding glucose to the two last solutions . • The experimental chamber contained every component of the experiments with GUVs in bulk ( except the mentioned osmolarity adjustment ) , apart from Vps34 complex I . • The injection pipette contained all components from the bulk experiments except GUVs . • 5x increase of the Vps34 complex I protein concentration to 2 . 5 µ M ( injection pipette ) . • Lipid composition in weight % : – 18 % Liver PI – 10 % POPS – 17 % POPE – 40 % DOPC – 15 % DOPS ( ⇒ total PS content : 25 % ) – 0 . 1 % RhodPE – 0 . 03 % DSPE - PEG2000biot The indicated lipid composition was found out experimentally , by varying the amounts of monounsaturated and saturated fatty acid lipids until the speed of activity of Vps34 complex I was in a detectable and convenient range for the nanotube pulling assay . A typical time course of an experiment is shown in Figure 5 . 3A , together with the ROI positions used for the plot in Figure 5 . 3B . Two ROIs were used for the tube , in order to potentially detect a gradient via these means . Two ROIs were also used for the GUV , as the membrane signal on the GUV was diﬀerent in horizontal versus vertical regions . Fits to a dose - response curve function were made using GraphPad Prism ( Figure 5 . 3B ) .

( 2012 ) ) was calculated , clearly showing again the increase in cur - vature sorting ( due to diﬀerences in generation rates ) around the EC 50 ( Figure 5 . 3D ) . In order to allow to detect a gradient ( if present ) , a longer tube was pulled ( Figure 5 . 3F ) , and indeed a gradient of the PX signal was present on the nanotube . The decrease of the PX signal to the right was not simply caused by the nanotube being out of focus on the right part ( Figure 5 . 3F , membrane channel ) . These results indicated to us that the activity of the Vps34 complex I was higher on the tube than on the GUV . We also measured the activity of Vps34 complex I on GUVs without tube , and also on these GUVs PI ( 3 ) P was generated ( Figure 5 . 3G ) . We compared Hill slopes and EC 50 values of GUVs with vs . without tube . The activity of Vps34 complex I was indistinguishable on GUVs with vs . without tube ( Figure 5 . 3H , I ) . If Vps34 complex I has a curvature dependent activity , then the diﬀerence is not very big , and further experiments would be needed to explore this more in detail . Interestingly , the PI ( 3 ) P generation had a lag phase , as well on GUVs as well as on tubes . The highest PI ( 3 ) P generation ( reﬂected by the EC 50 ) did not occur immediately after the start of injection of Vps34 complex I , but at least 2 minutes later . The observed delay could potentially reﬂect cooperative Vps34 complex I binding or activity . One possibility could be that either Vps34 complex I itself or the PX domain induce curvature , which in turn could either further recruit or activate the Vps34 complex I . Stabilisation of the tube , visible by a drop of the force that the tube applies on the bead and buckling of the tube , had indeed been observed ( Figure 5 . 3A , right ) and also membrane deformations of GUVs ( Figure 5 . 2A , right ) . Chapter 6 General Discussion And Conclusion During my thesis , I used the nanotube pulling assay to study protein properties of the GTPase dynamin , the N - BAR protein endophilin , the clathrin adapter AP180 and the protein complex I of yeast Vps34 . The assessed properties were membrane ﬁssion mediation , ﬁssion regulation , curvature induction and curvature - dependent activity . These experiments are further examples to show how this assay , which was initially developped to test the Canham - Helfrich theory about the membrane elastic energy , can be used to address a wide range of biological questions . The main biological question of this thesis was whether and how the N - BAR protein endophilin regulates dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion . The experiments in Chapter 4 provide an - swers to this question . A 4x molar excess of endophilin completely inhibited dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion in our nanotube pulling assay . Fission rates and eﬃciencies for diﬀerent endophilin - dynamin molar ratios were measured and we concluded that endophilin does not only delay ﬁssion , like observed for non - hydrolysable GTP analogs ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) , but also decreases the ﬁssion eﬃciency till complete blockage . Both endophilin’s membrane bind - ing and dynamin binding properties were required for the full blockage of ﬁssion , as shown by experiments using endophilin deletion constructs . A collaboration with Adam Frost and Nathaniel Talledge ( University of California San Francisco ) that involved cryo - EM and class averaging made it possible to obtain the structure of the endophilin - dynamin co - complex on membrane tubes . In the co - complex , 2 – 3 turns of endophilin are inserted between the dy - namin helix turns and the distance between dynamin turns was increased ∼ 2 fold compared to the polymer of dynamin alone . This explained the increased dynamin pitch that is observed on blocked vesicle necks in vivo ( Iversen et al . , 2003 ; Takei et al . , 1998 , 1995 ) . If dynamin also had an increased pitch in the co - complex in the nanotube pulling assay where ﬁssion was blocked , the ﬂuorescence signal of dynamin should be decreased in the co - complex compared to the pure dynamin polymer . The dynamin ﬂuorescence signal was measured for both cases and indeed the ﬂuorescence signal of dynamin was decreased 2 – 3 fold in the co - complex compared to the pure dynamin polymer . This allowed to propose a model for the mechanism by which endophilin inhibits dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion ( Figure 6 . 1 ) . While G domains of ad - jacent dynamin helix turns interact in the pure dynamin polymer ( Figure 6 . 1A ) , the endophilin insertion prevents the G domain interactions and the formation of a multi - turn helical dynamin coat ( Figure 6 . 1B ) . Both GTPase activity and constriction are therefore inhibited , which is why 88 General Discussion And Conclusion A B D Dynamin BAR B Interaction Dynamin Membrane tube Membrane tube Figure 6 . 1 : Model for the ﬁssion inhibition mechanism of endophilin . A , G - domains of adjacent dy - namin helix turns interact in the pure dynamin polymer . B , BAR proteins hamper inter - actions between dynamin head groups of adjacent dynamin turns by inserting between the turns , inhibiting constriction and ﬁssion . ﬁssion is blocked in the co - complex . As other BAR proteins also change the architecture of the dynamin coat ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) , we propose that this mechanism for ﬁssion inhibition also applies to other BAR proteins . If endophilin inhibits dynamin - mediated ﬁssion , the question remains how ﬁssion can then occur in the cell , where endophilin accumulates at the vesicle neck together with dynamin ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Endophilin recruits dynamin to vesicle necks ( Shupliakov , 1997 ; Sundborger et al . , 2011 ; Wigge et al . , 1997 ) , but in this co - complex , dynamin would not be ﬁssion competent . In order to allow ﬁssion , endophilin - free dynamin helix turns would be required . Either endophilin would need to unbind from the co - complex or dynamin would need to polymerise further into additional – endophilin - free – dynamin helix turns on the same membrane tube . For both cases , there are several known possibilities that can be suggested here for the release of the inhibition . The ﬁrst option is to decrease the aﬃnity between the SH3 domain of endophilin and the PRD of dynamin . This could be achieved by an increase of intracellular Ca 2 + levels which is proposed to induce an intramolecular inhibition mechanism where endophilin’s SH3 domain binds to another part of endophilin instead of binding to the PRD of dynamin ( Chen et al . , 2003 ) . Another possibility would be the phosphorylation of dynamin’s PRD ( Chen - Hwang et al . , 2002 ) . It is not clear whether unbinding of the SH3 and PRD domains is enough to release endophilin from the membrane tube but it might be suﬃcient to form additional endophilin - free dynamin helix turns on the same tube . The second option for releasing the inhition is to impede the membrane binding properties of endophilin . This could for example be achieved by LRRK2 phosphorylation of endophilin’s BAR domain ( Matta et al . , 2012 ) . The second question addressed during this thesis was whether the clathrin adapter AP180 induces membrane curvature on its own . A mixture of clathrin and AP180 had been observed to bind to membranes in a membrane tension and rigidity dependent manner and to deform low - tension giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) at low tension ( Saleem et al . , 2015 ) . In these experiments , AP180 was used as an adapter between clathrin and the membrane because clathrin cannot bind to the membrane itself . In order to distinguish which of the proteins was responsible for the observed membrane property - dependent binding and deformation , my 89 experiments tested whether AP180 contributed to the curvature induction ( Section 3 . 2 . 4 ) . The fact that the force of the tube on the bead in the nanotube pulling assay remained the same , independently of whether AP180 was bound to the tube or not , indicated that AP180 did not induce curvature . Therefore , the observed membrane deformation by the mixture of AP180 and clathrin could be assigned to clathrin or at least a combination of clathrin and AP180 . The third question to which my experiments provided an answer was whether the activity of yeast Vps34 complex I is curvature - dependent ( Chapter 5 ) . This had been suggested by experiments from our collaborators Ksenia Rostislavlea and Roger Williams ( MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Cambridge UK ; Rostislavleva et al . ( 2015 ) ) . The hypothesis of the curvature - dependence of the activity was tested using the nanotube pulling assay . During the replication of results with GUVs in bulk , we discovered that the activity of Vps34 complex I was dependent on the fatty acid content of the lipids of the membrane template in use . The complex was not active on saturated fatty acids ( 16 : 0 or 18 : 0 ) , while it was fully active on lipids containing monounsaturated fatty acids ( 18 : 1 ) . As lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids ( 20 : 4 or 22 : 6 ) reduced the activity , we have the hypothesis that the activity of Vps34 complex I is increased with lipid packing defects , which are partially reduced by polyunsaturated fatty acids ( Pinot et al . , 2014 ) . Using the nanotube pulling assay then addressed the initial question of a curvature dependent activity . A phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate ( PI ( 3 ) P ) gradient was detected on the nanotube , which indicated that the activity was higher on the tube than on the GUV because PI ( 3 ) P is the product of Vps34 complex I’s activity . On the other hand , the experiments made clear that if the activity of Vps34 complex I is activated by curvature , the eﬀect cannot be very high , as PI ( 3 ) P was generated with high rates on the less curved GUV membrane as well , similar to those on the nanotube . Further experiments would be needed to explore a curvature - dependent activity more in detail . The last question of this thesis was how mutations in two ubiquitous proteins that are im - plicated in endocytosis result in a hereditary muscle disease . Together with my lab colleague Valentina Galli and my supervisor Aurélien Roux , we addressed this question on a theoretical level in the frame work of a review ( Section 2 . 3 ) . Both dynamin 2 and the N - BAR pro - tein BIN1 / amphiphysin 2 were found to be mutated in patients having the hereditary disease centronuclear myopathy ( CNM ) . For this review , I analysed the structural and functional conse - quences of the mutations in BIN1 , with the currently available published knowledge about the mutations as a starting point . Depending on the domain which was aﬀected by the mutation , either curvature - inducing and scaﬀolding or dynamin binding properties were aﬀected . To - gether with the knowledge about the structural and functional consequences of the mutations in dynamin 2 , we come to the conclusion that both proteins seem to have a muscle - speciﬁc scaﬀolding function in the muscle . T - tubules – tubular invaginations that allow fast signal transmission and actin contraction upon an action potential – are discrupted in CNM patients with dynamin or BIN1 mutations . The scaﬀolding function of both proteins is apparently dis - turbed . Our model proposes that this is due to an imbalance between the two proteins when they are mutated . While dynamin has a major role in membrane ﬁssion in the whole organism , membrane ﬁssion would , according to our hypothesis , need to be inhibited in the muscle , and this is achieved by BIN1 . Dynamin together with BIN1 would stabilise T - tubules in the healthy muscle . One could imagine the same ﬁssion inhibition mechanism that is proposed for en - dophilin in Article 3 in Chapter 4 . To test the hypothesis that BIN1 inhibits dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion , one could use the nanotube pulling assay and measure ﬁssion rates for dy - namin together with BIN1 compared to dynamin alone , similar to the experiments presented in Chapter 4 .

B udding of spherical vesicles is essential for membrane trafﬁcking . Clathrin was the ﬁrst protein found to be involved in this process 1 , 2 . Clathrin polymerizes into truncated icosahedral cages in vitro 3 and together with various partners 4 deforms the membrane into a spherical bud 5 – 7 . Among the mechanisms involved in bud formation , amphipathic insertions , which act as wedges to create curvature , and the crowding effect 8 of proteins binding asymmetrically to the membrane have been investigated . On the contrary , clathrin was proposed to act by scaffolding , meaning that a protein coat of a given shape forces the membrane to curve 4 . The structure of the smallest clathrin cage is known in great detail 9 – 11 . However , clathrin also forms ﬂat hexagonal lattices at the plasma membrane of cells 12 , and spherical coated vesicles of various sizes , ranging from 35 to 200 nm , in various organisms 13 . This variability in size and shape has called into question the initially proposed membrane scaffolding mechanism based on clathrin polymerization . Clathrin binds membranes through a wide variety of adaptors including adaptin protein complexes ( AP - 1 , AP - 2 , AP - 3 and AP - 4 ) , AP180 / CALM , GGAs and Hrs 14 . Adaptors are speciﬁc to subsets of clathrin - mediated membrane trafﬁc pathways . In particular , AP180 has a high ability to polymerize clathrin in vitro , and forms smaller clathrin cages than clathrin alone 15 . AP180 has an ANTH domain that binds phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) 5 . However , it forms shallow pits when reconstituted on lipid monolayers 5 and does not bud the membrane of large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) 6 . These results suggested that clathrin polymerization energy was not the dominant factor in controlling the shape of clathrin coats . On the contrary , epsin 16 , a clathrin adaptor structurally similar to AP180 , facilitates the clathrin assembly on membranes into highly curved coated buds 17 . Although less potent in clathrin polymerization , epsin has an ENTH domain containing an amphipathic helix - 0 that wedges itself into the outer membrane leaﬂet , helping the build - up of curvature 17 . This supports the direct role of adaptors in curvature generation . Lipid membranes are deformable , ﬂuid surfaces 18 . To deform a membrane by scaffolding , the energetic gain upon coat poly - merization must be at least equal to the energetic cost associated with membrane deformation . The clathrin polymerization energy has never been compared with membrane budding energy . This depends on membrane tension , rigidity and geometry of the bud . We thus questioned how parameters of membrane elasticity ( that are , tension and rigidity ) could affect clathrin polymerization . Results Membrane tension opposes clathrin polymerization . To study the mechanism by which clathrin deforms the membrane , we reconstituted clathrin coats onto giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs , 5 – 50 m m ) . We used GUVs containing 30 % 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoserine ( DOPS ) and 10 % PIP 2 ( see Methods ) , mimicking the composition of the inner plasma membrane leaﬂet . The use of 10 % PIP 2 , although higher than physiological concentration , was used to rule out afﬁnity differ - ences between adaptors . Moreover , the physiological concentra - tion of PIP 2 within a clathrin - coated pit remains unknown . GUVs labelled with 1 % of tetra - methyl rhodamine ( TMR ) - PIP 2 were incubated with 0 . 5 m M puriﬁed AP180 and 0 . 4 m M puriﬁed clathrin containing 20 mol % of Alexa Fluor 488 - labelled clathrin ( AF488 - Clathrin ) ( see Methods ) . As expected , clathrin bound to GUVs only in the presence of the AP180 adaptor ( Fig . 1a , b ) and brain PIP 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . After clathrin binding , clathrin appeared as a homogenous stain , colocalizing with the membrane signal ( Fig . 1b ) . Clathrin formed a solid coat , as shown by the absence of recovery of coat ﬂuorescence after photobleaching ( Fig . 1c ) . Next , we studied the submicron structure of the clathrin coat using negative - stain electron microscopy ( EM ) of clathrin - coated LUVs . As previously reported 5 , 6 , we observed in most of the cases , small ( a few tens of nm ) , clathrin assemblies ( Figs 1d , e and 2e ; Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , covering the surface of the LUVs . The depth of these clathrin pits was difﬁcult to address by negative stain , although many of them seemed rather shallow ( Fig . 1e ) . Furthermore , the LUVs retained their round shape consistently with our confocal images of non - deformed GUVs . Importantly , all structures observed had limited depth ( see Fig . 1c , and inset of Fig . 2e , isotonic ; Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . As clathrin / AP180 forms highly curved cages in vitro in the absence of membrane 15 , we hypothesized that the combined effect of tension and bending rigidity was responsible for the impairment of full budding by opposing the clathrin polymerization energy . To conﬁrm whether changes in membrane tension affected polymerization of clathrin , we transferred GUVs made in 208 ± 1 mOsm sucrose solution to a clathrin / AP180 solution of varying osmolarity . We examined clathrin polymerization on GUVs under hypotonic ( 180 ± 1 mOsm ) , isotonic ( 208 ± 1 mOsm ) and hypertonic ( 236 ± 1 mOsm ) external buffer conditions . In isotonic conditions , no optically visible deforma - tions of GUVs were observed ( Fig . 1f , h ) . We observed that under hypotonic conditions GUVs did not allow AP180 / clathrin binding in most cases ( Fig . 1f , g ) . We observed that ﬂuorescent AP180 was binding efﬁciently under all osmotic conditions ( Fig . 1i ) with the same density ( see Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , even in the presence of clathrin . Furthermore , the binding of the terminal domain of clathrin ( clathrin TD ) to AP180 did not change signiﬁcantly with the change of osmotic conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . We thus concluded that increased membrane tension could totally impair clathrin polymerization . Also , as the surface density of the AP180 did not change in the presence of clathrin ( see Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , and since no deformation of the membrane was observed in presence of 0 . 5 m M AP180 alone in all osmotic conditions , we concluded that protein crowding had only a negligible effect , if any . While the 10 % PIP 2 concentration used provides more than enough binding sites to induce membrane deformation by crowding , the low afﬁnity of AP180 ANTH domain for PIP 2 ( a few micromolars , see ref . 5 ) , and the low AP180 concentration in our assay meant that not all binding sites were occupied . This accounts for the absence of membrane deformation mediated by AP180 crowding . Strikingly , both clathrin and membrane ﬂuorescence signals were strongly increased under hypertonic conditions ( Fig . 1f , g ) . In many cases , long , highly coated membrane tubules emanated from the GUVs , suggesting that under hypertonic conditions , the membrane could be heavily deformed by the clathrin coat ( Fig . 1f ) . We also observed ﬁve times more deformed GUVs in hypertonic conditions than in any other osmotic condition ( Fig . 1h ) . These deformations appeared a few minutes after clathrin addition ( see Supplementary Fig . 5a ) , which was consistent with the time it took to saturate the membrane with clathrin . AF488 - clathrin / AP180 - coated GUVs in isotonic condi - tions did not show more deformation when subjected to hypertonic shock ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . These results support our hypothesis that GUV deformation was a result of clathrin polymerization . To better characterize the shape of the membrane deforma - tions , GUVs incubated with AP180 / clathrin under varying osmotic conditions were ﬁxed and processed for thin - section electron microscopy ( TEM , see methods ) . Similar to the confocal images , TEM also revealed uncoated membranes when GUVs were incubated with proteins under hypotonic conditions ( Fig . 2a , d ) . GUVs incubated under isotonic conditions revealed ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms7249 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 6 : 6249 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms7249 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications & 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Furthermore , LUVs incubated with AP180 / clathrin under isotonic conditions ( see Fig . 2e ) remained round shaped , as seen by negative - stain EM . On these images ( see also Supplementary Fig . 2 ) the surface of the LUVs was covered with limited assemblies of clathrin , conﬁrming that the electron - dense coat seen by TEM was indeed a proper clathrin coat . However , these images show that rather than a purely hexagonal ﬂat lattice , the clathrin coat was constituted of densely packed shallow buds on the membrane ( see Fig . 1d , e and Supplementary Fig . 2 , monolayer and isotonic ) . Finally , GUVs incubated under hypertonic conditions showed an entirely budded surface , covered with an electron - dense coat ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Coated membrane buds were observed with an average diameter of 65 ± 5 nm , close to values of in vitro formed AP180 / clathrin cages 15 .

In summary , observations made by EM ( both TEM and negative stain ) were consistent with our confocal microscopy data ( Fig . 1 ) , and conﬁrmed that AP180 and clathrin can deform the membrane in a membrane tension - dependent way . Membrane elastic energy against clathrin polymerization energy . To quantitatively test our hypothesis , we developed a theoretical model that describes the competition between clathrin polymerization , which favours full budding , membrane tension and rigidity , which favour planar membranes , to predict transi - tions between different possible bud shapes ( see Fig . 3a ) . In the model , a ﬂat membrane with tension s , and bending rigidity k , is in contact with a clathrin / AP180 solution at ﬁxed concentrations . We denoted by m the free energy gain associated with the poly - merization of a unit area of clathrin coat . As membrane - bound clathrin coats are very rigid ( bending rigidity k c C 300 k B T 19 ) , we assumed that clathrin always polymerizes into spheres of ﬁxed radius r c . In our model , tension cannot modify the coat’s radius , but it can limit clathrin polymerization to partial buds as illustrated in Fig . 3a , b .

This coat is traversed by a small membrane tether of negligible energy 20 that connects the membrane bud to the main membrane . This connection is the only difference between our full buds and free clathrin - coated vesicles . This description is consistent with the partial coats observed by negative - stain EM ( Fig . 2e ; Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . To support this geometrical picture , we measured the average size of partial buds grown on mica - supported bilayers by atomic force microscopy to ﬁnd a height of 15 – 20 nm , and a diameter of 80 – 100 nm ( see Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Subtracting the B 15 nm thickness of the clathrin coat , these measurements are consistent with membrane buds of B 30 nm radius , and a depth of a few nanometres as illustrated in Fig . 3b . This model is also consistent with our EM studies , where we observed bare membranes in hypotonic conditions ( Fig . 2a ) , shallow buds in isotonic conditions ( Fig . 2a , e ) and deep buds in hypertonic conditions ( Fig . 2a , f ) . These observations support our assumption that AP180 / clathrin mostly polymerizes with a roughly constant radius of curvature r c . From our TEM pictures in hypertonic conditions ( see above and Fig . 2 ) , we thus concluded that r c ¼ 32 . 5 nm . In the model , we decomposed the polymerization energy of clathrin into two contributions ; m ¼ m 0 (cid:2) k = 2 r 2c (cid:2) (cid:3) , where m 0 is the Bare membrane Shallowpartial bud Deep partial bud A c L A m Full buds 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 GUV OT Force B e f o r e A ft e r 2422201816141210860 50 Time ( s ) 100 150 F o r c e p N AF488 - clathrin Clathrinaddition F drop TMR - PIP2 Δ R A m , A c Δ L tongue Micropipette Clathrin coat Injection micropipette 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 C l a t h r i n po l y m e r i z a t i on ene r g y (cid:2) ( m N m – 1 ) 0 Membrane tension (cid:3) ( mN m – 1 ) 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 1 10 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 Line tension τ ( pN ) 10 2 10 3 Bare membrane Shallow buds Deep buds Full buds 10 4 (cid:2) · r C S c a l ed c l a t h r i n po l . ene r g y (cid:4) (cid:3) · r C Scaled membrane tension (cid:4) Figure 3 | Model and clathrin polymerization energy measurements .

In addition , we introduced the coat’s line tension t , describing the energetic cost of broken clathrin – clathrin bonds at the boundary of a partial bud . This leads to the following expression for the free energy of a single bud : f ¼ s A m (cid:2) m A c þ t L ð 1 Þ where A m and A c are the membrane and coat areas , respectively , associated with one bud , and L is the length of its rim ( Fig . 3a ) . In this expression , m is dimensionally equivalent to a force per unit length , and represents the net force that a clathrin coat applies on the membrane while polymerizing . The membrane tension s and the bending rigidity k oppose this force , while the coat’s line tension t favours buds with short rims . To make predictions at the liposome level , we applied this theoretical framework to a densely packed assembly of coated buds ( see Fig . 3b and Supplementary Discussion ) . Depending on the value of the parameters , we can analytically predict the shape of the clathrin buds ( bare membrane , shallow / deep partial buds or full buds ) as shown in the phase diagram Fig . 3c . Qualitatively , for low clathrin polymerization energies ( m r 2 t / r c ) , the membrane is either bare for high tensions ( s 4 m ) or fully budded if s r m . These two regimes still exist at high polymerization energies ( m 4 2 t / r c ) , but with the added possibility of partial buds at moderate tensions . This high polymerization energy situation reproduces our above observations of GUVs under various osmotic conditions . We observed no polymerization for high tensions , and full budding for low tensions . Moreover , we do not observe purely hexagonal lattices ( see Fig . 2 , and also Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , and thus interpret the continuous ﬂuorescent staining of clathrin on GUVs ( Fig . 1 ) in isotonic conditions as a dense coverage of contiguous shallow buds ( see Figs 1e and 3b ) . To validate our model , we measured membrane tension s and clathrin polymerization energy m . We used an in vitro micro - manipulation assay ( see Fig . 3d ) 21 to pull a membrane nanotube out of GUVs by means of a streptavidin bead held in optical tweezers . We modulated the membrane tension s by aspirating the GUV in a micropipette . This technique allowed us to quantify and control tension in a way that cannot be achieved by osmotic shock . We measured the force F required to maintain the tube using optical tweezers . In the absence of clathrin , this force is given by 22 F ¼ 2 p ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 ks p , allowing us to measure 23 the membrane bending modulus k ¼ 13 ± 5 k B T . Once the tube was formed , a mix of AP180 and AF488 - clathrin in isotonic buffer was injected using a second micropipette ( see Methods and Fig . 3d ) . Clathrin binding was observed along the membrane tube and on the GUV surface . Clathrin GUV staining was homogeneous ( Fig . 3e ) , consistent with the formation of a continuous ﬂat coat as in Fig . 1a , b . Following clathrin polymerization , we observed a reduction of the total apparent GUV membrane area in 87 % of all experiments , consistent with the sequestration of the membrane into clathrin - coated pits ( see Fig . 3d , f ; Supplementary Table 1 ) . The 6 % reduction of the apparent GUV area ( see Supplementary Table 1 ) allowed us to calculate an average bud depth of 2 nm , which is consistent with our EM data . During clathrin polymerization on the GUV and the tube , we measured a drop in the tube force ( see Fig . 3f ) . AP180 alone did not induce a signiﬁcant force drop when binding to the tubes ( see Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . In cases where the apparent membrane area decreased , we used our mathematical model to infer the values of the parameters m and t from the decrease in apparent membrane area and tube force ( Supplementary Discussion ) . The resulting values are given in Supplementary Table 1 and denoted by full circles in the phase diagram of Fig . 3g ( colour code identical to Fig . 3c ) . In all cases , the measured values of m and s fell in the shallow bud regime , conﬁrming our hypothesis that continuous staining of clathrin - coated GUVs in isotonic conditions were indeed contiguous shallow buds . The measured value of the clathrin polymerization energy per unit area was equal to 7 . 6 ± 5 . 4 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 5 N . m (cid:2) 1 , with m 0 ¼ 1 . 0 ± 0 . 5 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 4 N . m (cid:2) 1 . We found t ¼ 5 . 2 ± 7 . 4 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 2 pN , well below values at which line tension is able to bud membrane domains on its own ( typically 1 pN , see ref . 24 ) . This supports our hypothesis that membrane bending is primarily due to clathrin polymerization and not due to the line tension . The clathrin polymerization energy is the sum of two contributions : clathrin – clathrin interactions and clathrin – membrane interactions mediated by the adaptors , which we express as m 0 ¼ m c (cid:2) c þ m c (cid:2) m . In the scaffolding mechanism , clathrin polymerization is the main driver of membrane deformation , implying that m c (cid:2) c is much larger than m c (cid:2) m . To test this model , we estimated the relative importance of m c (cid:2) c and m c (cid:2) m by measuring the force required to rupture the clathrin coat . We aspirated clathrin - coated GUV using a micropipette of radius R p C 1 m m ( Fig . 4a ) in isotonic conditions .

Upon increasing the aspiration pressure above D P c ¼ 231 ± 26 Pa , we observed a sudden rupture of the coat along the rim of the pipette followed by marked membrane tongue elongation ( Fig . 4a , b ) . The resulting cracks within the coat were visible both during a prolonged aspirated state and after releasing the aspiration ( Fig . 4c ) . We reasoned that rupturing the coat in this way disrupted the clathrin – clathrin bonds while leaving the clathrin – membrane interactions unaffected , thus allowing us to estimate m c (cid:2) c independently of m c (cid:2) m . From D P c and R p , we estimated m c (cid:2) c ¼ 1 . 1 ± 0 . 1 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 4 N . m (cid:2) 1 ( see Supplementary Note 1 ) . This value is indistinguishable from m 0 ¼ 1 . 0 ± 0 . 5 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 4 N . m (cid:2) 1 , conﬁrming that clathrin – clathrin interactions are the predomi - nant interactions responsible for clathrin coat’s assembly as in the scaffolding model . Multiplying m c (cid:2) c by the speciﬁc area a C 800nm 2 occupied by a triskelion ( see Supplementary Note 2 ) yields the binding energy per triskelion a m c (cid:2) c ¼ 23 ± 3 k B T . Our value of the binding energy is consistent with a previous theoretical estimate based on the critical concentration of clathrin polymerization 25 , a m c (cid:2) c ¼ 42 k B T , and with estimates coming from computational assembly statistics 26 , where a m c (cid:2) c ¼ 23 k B T . Also , it is too large to allow for internal rearrangements of the clathrin lattice once polymerized , implying that clathrin buds directly polymerize into curved structures rather than going through a hexagonal ﬂat coat intermediate . Espin facilitates clathrin polymerization . To further validate our model , we used these results to predict the shape of clathrin coats by changing parameters . We tested this prediction experimentally by investigating the predicted role of the bending rigidity in inhibiting budding . The expression m ¼ m 0 (cid:2) k = 2 r 2c (cid:2) (cid:3) implies that an increased k should reduce the value of the polymerization energy m . We used GUVs of higher bending rigidity obtained by TMR - PIP2 AF488 - clathrin AP180 / AF488 - clathrin on high bending rigidity GUVs Epsin / AF - clathrin on normal GUVs TMR - PIP2 AF488 - clathrin Hypo Hypo Hypo 50 40 N o . o f v e s i c l e s P e r c en t age v e s i c l e ( % ) 30 20 10 0 Iso Iso Binding No binding No deformation Small deformation Large deformation Hyper Hyper Hypo TMR - PIP2 AF488 - AP180 Iso Hyper Hypo Iso Hyper T M R - P I P 2 A F 488 - c l a t h r i n 100 80 60 40 20 0 Figure 5 | Effect of high bending rigidity and epsin on the clathrin budding abilities .

All rights reserved . adding sphingolipids and cholesterol ( 60 % brain sphingomyelin ( BSM ) , 30 % DOPS , 10 % PIP 2 , with 50 % cholesterol ) to increase the bending rigidity to k ¼ 51 ± 20 k B T . This decreased the average value of m by more than an order of magnitude ( m stiff ¼ 3 . 7 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 6 N . m (cid:2) 1 ) , implying a marked decrease of the maximum tension allowing clathrin assembly to 3 . 5 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 6 N . m (cid:2) 1 . Consistent with our expectation , clathrin failed to bind to a vast majority of liposomes ( Fig . 5a ) under isotonic conditions despite signiﬁcant binding of AP180 ( Fig . 5d ) . We further tested whether clathrin polymerization could be restored by changing membrane tension , but did not observe any clathrin binding neither under hypotonic nor hypertonic conditions ( see Fig . 5b , c ) , further showing the inﬂuence of membrane bending rigidity on clathrin polymerization . To further test our model , we predicted that any adaptors with membrane - deforming properties should assist budding . We thus studied the polymerization of clathrin on GUVs as mediated by epsin . We found that epsin binds to liposomes under all tested membrane tensions ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) without causing observable deformations , as does AP180 . When GUVs were incubated with the unlabelled epsin and AF488 - clathrin under hypotonic conditions , 70 % of the vesicles showed membrane deformations ( Fig . 5e , f ) . Signiﬁcant membrane deformation and tubulation were also observed under isotonic conditions . Like - wise , under hypertonic conditions the GUVs were highly deformed ( Fig . 5d ) . Thus the membrane - deforming properties of epsin facilitated clathrin polymerization to such an extent that it was able to bind to GUVs even under unfavourable membrane tension conditions . Discussion In this study , we showed that the shape of clathrin coats is controlled by membrane tension . This mechanism is based on counteracting clathrin polymerization by membrane tension , which hinders the closure of the clathrin - coated pits : at low membrane tension , deep buds can form , whereas intermediate or high tensions will only result in partial budding . We measured the clathrin polymerization energy and found values that are in the range of in vivo membrane tension values ( 10 (cid:2) 5 – 10 (cid:2) 4 N . m (cid:2) 1 —see refs 27 – 29 ) . Thus , in vivo values of membrane tension cover the shape transition from a shallow to a deep budded coat , supporting a physiological control of clathrin budding through membrane tension . It is consistent with the fact that clathrin - mediated endocytosis is delayed in cells that have higher membrane tension and require actin for completion 30 , 31 . We imagine that at the structural level , membrane tension does not allow for the correct binding angle between arms of the triskelia , impairing their correct association . We also found that increased membrane rigidity opposes clathrin budding . It is consistent with the fact that clathrin - mediated endocytosis is slower at the apical pole of epithelia , where the membrane is more rigid than at the basal pole 32 . We also found that the membrane - deforming ability of epsin favours clathrin - mediated budding , even when the membrane’s elastic parameters ( namely tension and rigidity ) are not favourable . This indicates that the different actors that can generate membrane curvature ( wedge insertion , crowding or local forces exerted by the cytoskeleton ) can act synergistically to deform the membrane : the role of adaptors and actin in clathrin - induced membrane deformation has been studied extensively . However , conclusions about whether they are required or sufﬁcient for membrane deformation proved themselves difﬁcult to generalize to all biological systems . Our results support a modulatory role of each adaptor and actin depending on the difﬁculty of deforming the membrane 31 : in an extreme case where the membrane is very stiff and tension is high , all partners are required , whereas they become dispensable in intermediate conditions . For energetic 25 , kinetic and biochemical reasons 33 , it seemed more favourable to consider that clathrin polymerizes directly into its ﬁnal curved shape . However , explaining the various shape of clathrin coats has for long been a matter of debate : it was proposed 12 and analysed theoretically 26 , 34 how the clathrin lattice could be reorganized to change shape once polymerized . Another possibility is that the clathrin coat is soft enough once polymerized to deform elastically under increasing tension . However , measurement of the clathrin - coated membrane bending rigidity showed it is about 10 times more than free lipid membranes , which accounts for less than 5 % change in size by elastic deformation ( theory not shown ) . Moreover , our model and ﬁndings favour the direct polymerization of clathrin in a curved lattice with AP180 . They also account for how the shape of the bud could be modulated by membrane tension . Our ﬁndings are compatible with the fact that partial knockdown of clathrin generates shallow pits in vivo 35 , as our model predicts a decrease in clathrin’s cytosolic concentration would result in a lowering of its polymerization energy m . Similar shallow coats were also observed with both H 6 - D ANTH - AP180 and full - length H 6 - AP180 , together with clathrin in a recent reconstitution study suggesting that clathrin polymerization alone could drive membrane bending 13 . The polymerization of other membrane coats has also been shown to depend on tension . Such examples include the shape of Coat Proteins I ( COPI ) coats that change from ﬂat to a budded state when tension is decreased 36 , and caveolae that can be disrupted by increased membrane tension 28 . More generally , actin plays a critical role in the clathrin bud formation , in all cell types that have been studied , from yeast 37 to mammals 28 , 29 . Actin is the main membrane tension regulator in eukaryotic cells . Its role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis thus may indicate that membrane tension is a general regulator of clathrin - mediated endocytosis .

Fluorescent lipid bodipy - tetra - methyl - rhodamine - PIP 2 ( TMR - PIP 2 ) were purchased from Echelon Bios - ciences . Two lipid compositions were used— ( 1 ) 25 % DOPC þ 30 % DOPE þ 5 % liver PI þ 30 % DOPS þ 10 % PIP 2 supplemented with 15 % cholesterol and 1 % TMR - PIP 2 ; ( 2 ) 60 % BSM þ 30 % DOPS þ 10 % PIP 2 þ 1 % TMR - PIP 2 supplemented with 50 % cholesterol . streptavidin - coated polystyrene beads ( 3 . 05 m m ) used for nanotube pulling experiments were purchased from Spherotech . Clathrin was extracted from fresh porcine brains and puriﬁed as described in ref . 15 . Clathrin was labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide ( Invitrogen ) . AP180 was expressed in BL21 / DH3 a cells and puriﬁed by glutathione S transferase pull - down and glutathione S transferase cleaved by PreScission protease . AP180 was labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide ( Invitrogen ) . Epsin was puriﬁed from cells infected with baculovirus as described in ref . 5 and labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide ( Invitrogen ) . All proteins were aliquoted in GTPase buffer ( HEPES 20m M pH ¼ 7 . 4 , NaCl 100m M and MgCl 2 1m M ) and stored at (cid:2) 80 (cid:2) C . Preparation of GUVs . The GUVs were composed of 25 % DOPC , 30 % DOPE , 5 % liver PI , 30 % DOPS , 10 % PIP 2 , 15 % cholesterol and 1 % TMR - PIP 2 ( ﬂuorescent lipid ) in chloroform / methanol at a concentration of 2mgml (cid:2) 1 . The lipid mix was dried under N 2 ﬂux and further dried under vacuum for 1h before being resuspended in pure chloroform . To obtain a good yield of GUVs containing highly negatively charged lipids , the electroformation of GUVs was performed as described in ref . 21 . Brieﬂy , a uniform smear of 10 m l of lipid mix at 2mgml (cid:2) 1 was ﬁrst dried on conductive indium - tin oxide - coated glass ( Pra¨zisions Glas and Optik GmbH ) for 30min at 60 (cid:2) C , followed by drying under vacuum for at least 1h . The lipid ﬁlm was then rehydrated in a sucrose solution at 208 ± 1mOsm and GUVs were allowed to grow for 1h under a sine voltage ( 900mV , 10Hz ) . For iso - osmotic experimental conditions , a sucrose solution of equal osmolarity as the protein solution was used , while for hypertonic and hypotonic conditions , more concentrated or less concentrated ( respectively ) sucrose solutions were used .

All rights reserved . Confocal microscopy . An open homemade observation chamber was incubated with a 2mgml (cid:2) 1 casein solution for 15min to avoid adhesion of GUVs to the coverslip . The chamber was then rinsed twice with GTPase buffer ( see above ) before injecting 180 m l of the same buffer containing the proteins . The ﬁnal con - centrations of AP180 and clathrin were 0 . 5 and 0 . 4 m M , respectively . The protein mix was allowed to equilibrate in the chamber , followed by injection of 4 – 5 m l of GUVs . Imaging was carried out on a Nikon confocal microscope . Identical laser power and gain settings were used during the course of all experiments . Electron microscopy . An excess of GUVs in different osmotic environments was incubated with protein mix and visualized by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy for binding of AP180 / clathrin . The protein - bound GUVs were ﬁxed with 4 % glutar - aldehyde , embedded in 2 % agar to increase the sedimentation of the liposomes and spun for 5 , 000r . p . m . for 3 – 4min to pellet down the sample . The sample was treated with 0 . 4 M Millonig’s buffer ( sodium phosphate ( monobasic ) þ NaOH ) containing 2 % osmium tetroxide for 1h and rinsed with ddH 2 O . The sample was stained with 0 . 25 % uranyl acetate overnight and rinsed with ddH 2 O followed by sequential dehydration in 30 , 50 , 70 and 90 % ethanol for 5 – 10min . The last dehydration step was carried out three times in absolute ethanol for 30min each . The sample was then washed with propylene oxide twice for 10min followed by incubation in epon - propylene oxide ( 1 : 1 ) for 1h . Finally , the sample was treated with 100 % epon overnight at room temperature before being embedded in 1ml of epon resin mix followed by curing at 65 (cid:2) C for at least 24h . Ultrathin sectioning was performed using a microtome ( Leica Ultracut ) at a cutting angle of 6 (cid:2) . Sections were put on glow - discharged carbon - coated formvar grids and viewed with a Tecnai G2 Sphera ( FEI ) electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 160kV and an exposure time of 1 , 000ms . Also , for negative - stain EM observations , LUVs were ﬁrst incubated with AP180 / clathrin in suspension for 10 – 15min and then adsorbed onto Formvar - coated EM grids . The samples were ﬁxed and negatively stained with 2 % uranyl acetate before visualization . Clathrin polymerization energy measurements . GUVs were aspirated in a micropipette controlled by a motorized micromanipulator ( Sutter MP225 ) and a custom - made hydraulic system to control the aspiration pressure D P and to set the membrane tension : s ¼ 12 R p D P 1 (cid:2) R p R v where R p and R v are the radii of the pipette and GUV , respectively . A membrane nanotube was pulled out of a GUV whose membrane was attached to a streptavidin - coated bead ( 3 . 05 m m diameter , Spher - otec ) held in a ﬁxed optical trap . The optical trap was custom - made with an ytterbium ﬁbre laser focused through a 100 (cid:3) 1 . 3 numerical apperture oil immersion objective . The force F exerted on the bead was calculated from the Hooke’s law : F ¼ k * D x , where k is the stiffness of the trap ( k ¼ 360pN m m (cid:2) 1 W (cid:2) 1 ) calibrated by the viscous drag method 38 and D x the displacement of the bead from its equilibrium position in the optical trap measured with a custom - made video tracking software . AP180 and clathrin were injected close to the nanotube using a second micropipette with a typical radius of 10 m m controlled with a hydraulic micromanipulator ( Narishige ) . Nanotubes were visualized simultaneously by brightﬁeld imaging ( Pixelink camera ) and by dual - colour confocal microscopy ( l 1 ¼ 488nm and l 2 ¼ 543nm ) on an inverted Nikon eclipse Ti microscope . The clathrin polymerization energy was measured for increasing values of set membrane tensions . Image analysis . Images were analysed and processed with ImageJ . The ﬂuorescence signal , F vesicle along the equatorial plane of GUVs was quantiﬁed by measuring the average ﬂuorescence of the membrane using the OvalProﬁle plugin of ImageJ . The background ﬂuorescence of the unbound protein , F background was measured in an area close to the vesicle . Fluorescence intensity of the vesicle was denoted as I ¼ ( F vesicle (cid:2) F background ) . Same illumination and detection settings were used for all the experimental conditions . Electron micrographs were manually analysed using ImageJ to measure the average bud diameter of 65 ± 5nm under hypertonic conditions . Atomic force microscopy on supported bilayer . Ten m l of a 10 - mgml (cid:2) 1 lipid mixture was dropped onto a circular glass coverslip , air dried and kept under vacuum for at least 1h . The dried lipid smear was hydrated with 90 m l of GTPase buffer for 30min , followed by rinsing to peel off the membrane regions that did not adhere to the surface . Two m l of the protein mix ( AP180 þ clathrin ) was incubated with the adhered membrane sheet for 30min , followed by rinsing with GTPase buffer to wash the unbound protein . The protein - binding membrane sheet was then ﬁxed with 4 % glutaraldehyde and 1 . 8 % osmium tetroxide for 1h , followed by washes with GTPase buffer . The sample was then dehydrated by series of ethanol washes ( 30 % , 50 % , 70 % and 90 % ethanol for 5min each ) and further kept overnight under absolute ethanol . The dried sample was then imaged using the Multimode V AFM ( Veeco ) in tapping mode . Pointprobe Plus tips ( Nanosensors , Neuchatel , Switzerland ) with non - contact high frequency ( C ¼ 42N . m (cid:2) 1 , f o ¼ 330kHz ) were used for scanning the image . References 1 .

For a non - broken coat , this force is couteracted by the contact forces at the rim of the pipette , which are evenly distributed along the contact line of length 2π R ! . Thus , each unit length of coat is subjected to a shearing force equal to π 𝑅 ! ! ∆ 𝑃 / ( 2π 𝑅 ! ) = 𝑅 ! ∆ 𝑃 / 2 . At coat rupture , this expression is equal to the force per unit length , µμ c -­‐ c , characteristic for the clathrin - clathrin bonds . Numerically , we use 𝑅 ! = 1µμ m , implying 𝜇 c -­‐ c = 1 . 1 ± 0 . 1 × 10 ! ! 𝑁𝑚 ! ! . Supplementary Note 2 : Calculation of the clathrin - clathrin binding energy : The side of a clathrin hexagon is 𝑠 = 25 nm , hence its area is 𝐴 = ( 3 √ 3 𝑠 ! ) / 2 = 1600 nm ! . There are 6 triskelia per hexagon , but each is shared between 3 hexagons , thus there are 2 triskelia per hexagon on average . Hence the specific area of a triskelion is 𝑎 = 𝐴 / 2 = 800 nm ! . As 𝜇 c -­‐ c = 1 . 1 ± 0 . 1 × 10 ! ! 𝐽𝑚 ! ! , the lateral interaction energy per triskelion is 𝑎 × 𝜇 c -­‐ c = 8 × 1 . 1 × 10 ! ! " J = 23 ± 3 𝑘 ! 𝑇 . bhjh Supplemental mathematical modeling Here we describe our model for the determination of the shape of clathrin - coated buds as a function of the membrane’s mechanical parameters in the presence of a large ( non - limiting ) amount of the adaptor AP180 . We ﬁrst consider an inﬁnite , planar membrane with tension σ . The membrane is put in contact with a clathrin solution of ﬁxed concentration , which favors the assembly of clathrin buds of ﬁxed radius r c on the membrane . Consistent with the free energy per bud introduced in Eq . ( 1 ) of the main text , we write the free energy per unit surface area of the initially ﬂat membrane as f = σA m − µA c + τ‘ A p , ( S1 ) where µ = µ 0 − κ / ( 2 r 2 c ) is the free energy gain per unit area upon clathrin polymerization – here µ 0 is related to the concentration of the clathrin solution . In Eq . ( S1 ) , A m and A c respectively denote the membrane and coat areas associated with a single bud , ‘ is the length of the coat - bare membrane interface and A p is the projected area of the bud [ Fig . 1 ( a ) ] . We assume that our system is at equilibrium , implying that the system selects the bud shape that minimizes the free energy of Eq . ( S1 ) . In Sec . , we describe the various acceptable morphologies for the system and the associated free energies . In Sec . , we compare these energies and determine the one that dominates the system depending on its parameters . Finally , in Sec . , we describe the procedure used in the main text to extract these parameters from the experimental data . Bud geometry and energy We consider a membrane homogeneously covered by identical buds characterized by an opening angle θ [ Fig . 1 ( a ) ] . Buds may exhibit morphologies going from non - existent to partial to full buds , and in the fol - lowing sections we successively study the four subcases illustrated in Fig . 1 ( b ) . Bare membrane If clathrin does not bind to the membrane , we have A c = 0 and ‘ = 0 . The membrane is then ﬂat , implying A m = A p , and thus f bare σ = 1 . ( S2 ) Shallow partial bud We consider a bud with an opening angle θ ∈ [ 0 , π / 2 ] , implying A c = A m . Deﬁning the relative excess area as a = A m / A p − 1 , ( S3 ) it is easily shown that cos θ = 1 − a 1 + a , sin θ = 2 √ a 1 + a , r c ‘ A p = 1 + a √ a . ( S4 ) Deﬁning dimensionless variables ˜ µ = µ / σ and ˜ τ = τ / ( r c σ ) , ( S5 ) and minimizing the free energy over a we ﬁnd that for ˜ µ 6 1 f σ = ( 1 − ˜ µ ) ( 1 + a ) 2 1 − a , with a given by 1 − a 2 a 3 / 2 = 1 − ˜ µ ˜ τ ( S6 ) We plot the corresponding opening angle as a function of the dimensionless parameters in Fig . 1 ( c ) .

The membrane is represented in orange and the clathrin coat in green . ( b ) Illustration of the four types of coat morphologies consided in Secs . - . ( c ) Partial bud opening angle as a function of the scaled clathrin adhesion energy ˜ µ for several values of the scaled line tension ˜ τ as given by Eqs . ( S4 ) , ( S6 ) for shallow partial buds and Eqs . ( S7 ) , ( S8 ) for deep partial buds . Deep partial bud We now consider a bud with an opening angle θ ∈ [ π / 2 , π ] . As pictured in Fig . 1 ( a ) , only the curved part of the membrane is covered by clathrin , implying that some of the membrane is uncovered . As a consequence , the deﬁnition of Eq . ( S3 ) now implies cos θ = 1 − √ a , sin θ = 1 − ( 1 − √ a ) 2 , A c / A p = 2 √ a , r c ‘ A p = 4 √ a − 2 a . ( S7 ) Minimizing with respect to a we ﬁnd that the resulting membrane free energy has a global minimum for θ ∈ [ π / 2 , π ] ⇔ a ∈ [ 1 , 4 ] if and only if 1 6 ˜ µ 6 2 and 0 6 ˜ τ 6 1 − ˜ µ / 2 . We then obtain f σ = 1 − ( ˜ µ − 2˜ τ ) 2 1 − 2˜ τ , with a = (cid:18) ˜ µ − 2˜ τ 1 − 2˜ τ (cid:19) 2 . ( S8 ) We plot the corresponding opening angle as a function of the dimensionless parameters in Fig . 1 ( c ) . Full bud A full bud is simply described by the θ → π limit of the bud discussed in Sec . , implying f σ = 1 + 4 ( 1 − ˜ µ ) and a = 4 . ( S9 ) Morphology of the system Comparing the free energies described in Eqs . ( S2 ) , ( S6 ) , ( S8 ) and ( S9 ) , we plot the stability diagram of the diﬀerent types of buds in Fig . 2 . There , the coexistence lines are given by : • Bare membrane / full buds : ˜ µ = 1 • Bare membrane / shallow buds : ˜ τ = 2 hq 1 4 ( 1 − ˜ µ ) 2 + 2 1 − ˜ µ − 1 − 1 2 ( 1 − ˜ µ ) i 3 / 2 hq 1 4 ( 1 − ˜ µ ) 2 + 2 1 − ˜ µ − 1 2 ( 1 − ˜ µ ) i 2 • Shallow / deep buds : ˜ µ = 1 Supplemental mathematical modeling – Saleem et al . 3 0 1 2 3 0 . 25 0 0 . 75 0 . 5 ͠ μ ͠ τ shallow partial buds deep partial buds bare membrane full buds Supplementary Model Figure 2 : Bud morphology as a function of the dimensionless clathrin adhesion energy and the line tension . • deep / full buds : ˜ τ = 1 − ˜ µ / 2 The stability diagram presented in the main text presents these same regime boundaries in terms of the scaled surface tension σ / ( τ / r c ) and adhesion free energy µ / ( τ / r c ) . Experimental determination of the clathrin parameters To determine the two dimensionless parameters ˜ µ and ˜ τ introduced above as well as their dimensional coun - terparts µ and τ , we measure two independent quantities for each experiment presented in the main text : the force required to pull a tether from a clathrin - covered giant unilamellar vesicle ( GUV ) and the change in its membrane surface area upon clathrin polymerization . Here we describe the theoretical procedure used to infer the former from the latter . The results derived for the inﬁnite ﬂat system case studied above provide us with the membrane’s equation of state , which can be used in the more complex experimentally relevant situation pictured in Fig . 3 . There , a GUV is held in an aspiration pipette while a membrane tether is pulled from it using optical tweezers . A controlled pressure diﬀerence P e − P p is maintained between the exterior and the inside of the pipette , allowing a regulation of the membrane tension . To understand this regulation , we ﬁrst consider a clathrin - less GUV and apply Laplace’s law both the the surface of the vesicle and the spherical region at the end of the membrane tongue ( the membrane in the aspiration pipette ) . We ﬁnd that the membrane has a tension σ 0 given by P v − P e = 2 σ 0 R v 0 , P v − P p = 2 σ 0 R p ⇒ σ 0 = R v 0 R p 2 ( R v 0 − R p ) ( P e − P p ) . ( S10 ) A membrane tether of radius r and length L is then extracted from the GUV using optical tweezers . Its free energy is given by F t = 2 πrL ( σ 0 + κ / 2 r 2 ) − F 0 L , which is composed of a tension , bending energy and pulling force contribution ( κ is the membrane bending modulus ) . Minimizing F t with respect to r and L , we ﬁnd the tether radius and the force required to extract it : r 0 = p κ / 2 σ 0 , F 0 = 2 π √ 2 κσ 0 . ( S11 ) When clathrin is injected into the setup ( in the exterior region ) , it polymerizes on the vesicle and tether and introduces a modiﬁcation of the tether force . Denoting by x the diﬀerence in membrane tongue length before and after clathrin injection , the system’s free energy reads F = − πxR 2 p P p + 4 πR 3 v 3 P e + 4 πR 2 v f + σ ( 4 πR 2 v A m / A p − 4 πR 2 v 0 − 2 πR p ) + P v ( πxR 2 p − 4 πR 3 v / 3 ) , ( S12 ) Supplemental mathematical modeling – Saleem et al . 4 clathrin coat membrane R v P p P v P e r R p x pipette optically trapped bead L membrane tongue Supplementary Model Figure 3 : Schematic of the experimental setup discussed in Sec . and used in the main text . where the membrane tension σ and ﬂuid pressure inside the vesicle P v are introduced as the Lagrange multipliers respectively enforcing the conservation of membrane area and water volume : 4 πR 2 v A m / A p − 4 πR 2 v 0 − 2 πR p x = 0 ( S13a ) 4 πR 3 v / 3 − 4 πR 3 v 0 / 3 − πR 2 p x = 0 . ( S13b ) In this more complicated situation , Laplace’s law for the clathrin - coated vesicle and membrane tongue is recovered by minimizing F with respect to R v and R p , yielding respectively P v − P e = 2 f R v , P v − P p = 2 σ R p . ( S14 ) Moreover , the tether free energy is now given by 2 πrL [ κ / ( 2 r 2 ) + f ] − FL , and minimizing with respect to r and L thus yields the tether force F = 2 π p 2 κf . ( S15 ) Combining Eqs . ( S10 - S11 ) and ( S14 - S15 ) , we ﬁnd f σ = R v R p + (cid:18) R v R v 0 − R v R p (cid:19) (cid:18) F 0 F (cid:19) 2 , ( S16 ) through which the quantity f / σ discussed in Sec . can be directly inferred from the experimentally measured tether forces before and after clathrin injection . We next turn to the change in membrane area following clathrin injection . Using ﬂuorescence microscopy , the GUV radius and tongue length can be monitored throughout the experiment ( the area of the membrane tether is negligible ) . Using the deﬁnition of the excess area a introduced in Sec . , we write the membrane area stored in the clathrin - covered part of the GUV as ( 1 + a ) ( 4 πR 2 v − πR 2 p ) . We are thus able to assess the amount of membrane area stored in the clathrin buds by writing membrane area conservation , yielding an experimental measure of the excess area a = 4 ( R 2 v 0 − R 2 v ) + 2 R p x 4 R 2 v − R 2 p . ( S17 ) Finally , the values of the clathrin parameters ˜ µ and ˜ τ are calculated by identifying the expressions Eqs . ( S16 ) and ( S17 ) with those derived in Sec . for the quantities f / σ and a . In practice , all experimental points are in the shallow bud regime , yielding ˜ µ = 1 − f σ 1 − a ( 1 + a ) 2 ( S18a ) ˜ τ = = f σ 2 a 3 / 2 ( 1 + a ) 2 . ( S18b ) The dimensional adhesion free energy and line tension µ and τ are then calculated through Eq . ( S5 ) , using the experimentally measured value r c = 32 . 5 nm .

( S16 ) and ( S17 ) with those derived in Sec . S1 for the quantities f / σ and a . In practice , all experi - mental points are in the shallow bud regime , yielding ˜ µ = 1 − f σ 1 − a ( 1 + a ) 2 ( S18a ) ˜ τ = = f σ 2 a 3 / 2 ( 1 + a ) 2 . ( S18b ) The dimensional adhesion free energy and line tension µ and τ are then calculated through Eq . ( S5 ) , using the experimentally measured value r c = 32 . 5 nm .
