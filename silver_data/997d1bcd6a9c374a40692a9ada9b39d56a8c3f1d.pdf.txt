In contrast to animals and yeasts , CME in plants depends on the TPLATE complex ( TPC ) , an evolutionary ancient adaptor complex . The mechanistic contribution of the individual TPC subunits to plant CME remains however elusive . In this study , we used a multidisciplinary approach to elucidate the structural and functional roles of the evolutionary conserved N - terminal Eps15 homology ( EH ) domains of the TPC subunit AtEH1 / Pan1 . By integrating high - resolution structural information obtained by X - ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy with all - atom molecular dynamics simulations , we provide structural insight into the function of both EH domains . Whereas one EH domain binds negatively charged PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 lipids , unbiased peptidome profiling by mass - spectrometry revealed that the other EH domain interacts with the double N - terminal NPF motif of a novel TPC interactor , the integral membrane protein Secretory Carrier Membrane Protein 5 ( SCAMP5 ) . Furthermore , we show that AtEH / Pan1 proteins control the internalization of SCAMP5 via this double NPF peptide interaction motif . Collectively , our structural and functional studies reveal distinct but complementary roles of the EH domains of AtEH / Pan1 have in plant CME and connect the internalization of SCAMP5 to the TPLATE complex . Introduction Internalization of membrane proteins is of crucial importance for cell survival as it allows to quickly react to changing environmental conditions . The residence time of integral membrane proteins at the plasma membrane is controlled by internalization signals that are recognized by adaptor protein complexes that mediate a process named clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . The start of CME is marked by an enrichment of cargo proteins and negatively charged PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 lipids ( Ischebeck et al . , 2013 ) . In the next stage , adaptor proteins and clathrin are recruited in a timed fashion and accumulate at the site of endocytosis ( Qi et al . , 2018 ) . In the later stages , accessory proteins and additional clathrin molecules are recruited followed by scission of the formed vesicle from the plasma membrane . The main driver during this process are low affinity protein - protein and protein - lipids interactions , which enable this dynamic process of assembly and disassembly . In plants , two adaptor complexes play a role during the initiation phase of endocytosis , the Adaptor Protein - 2 complex ( AP - 2 ) and the TPLATE complex ( TPC ) ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Rubbo et al . , 2013 ) . AP - 2 and TPC likely have independent but also complementary roles in CME ( Gadeyne et al , 2014 ) . Both protein complexes have a core - complex of four subunits ( Hirst et al . , 2014 ) , which in the case of TPC is associated with four additional subunits ( TWD40 - 1 , TWD40 - 2 , AtEH1 / Pan1 and AtEH2 / Pan1 ) . The AtEH / Pan1 proteins are more loosely associated with TPC as they for example do not associate with the other complex subunits when a truncated TML subunit forces TPC into the cytoplasm ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ) and they do not co - purify with the complex in Dictyostelium ( Hirst et al . , 2014 ) . Recent evidence suggests however a similar arrival time of all TPC subunits at the plasma membrane at the onset of endocytosis , preceding clathrin arrival ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Narasimhan et al . , 2020 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ) . The AtEH / Pan1 proteins are the plant homologs of yeast Pan1p , which is known for its role as an activator of ARP2 / 3 - dependent actin dynamics during endocytosis ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ; Toshima et al . , 2005 , 2007 ) . Pan1p was also recently shown to be part of a phosphorylation - dependent mechanism connecting endocytic vesicles , endosomal compartments and actin dynamics in budding yeast ( Toshima et al . , 2016 ) . The Arabidopsis AtEH / Pan1 proteins were recently shown to mediate actin - dependent autophagy in plants ( Wang et al . , 2019 ) . AtEH / Pan1 and Pan1p proteins are both hallmarked by the presence of two EH domains at their N - terminus ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2019 ) . In animals and yeast , EH domains have been characterized in great detail due to their presence in crucial endocytic proteins like Eps15 , REPS1 , EHD1 , etc . ( Beer et al . , 2000 ; Kieken et al . , 2009 ; Kim et al . , 2001 ) . SMART and Prosite analysis identified only six EH domains in Arabidopsis compared to eighteen in humans ( Letunic and Bork , 2017 ; Sigrist et al . , 2013 ) . In Arabidopsis , EH domains are present in the endocytic recycling regulators EHD1 and EHD2 , each having one EH domain ( Bar et al . , 2008 ) and in the TPC subunits AtEH1 / Pan1 and AtEH2 / Pan1 , each having two EH domains . Plant EHD1 and EHD2 proteins have been characterized as homologues of human EHD proteins and were suggested to play a regulatory role during plant CME , plant defense and salt stress ( Bar and Avni , 2009 ; Bar et al . , 2008 , 2013 ) . In contrast to the essential function of all tested TPC subunits , silencing of EHD1 / 2 does not result in severely aberrant phenotypes , indicating redundancy or a more specialized function ( Bar et al . , 2008 ; Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2019 ) . In contrast to the single EH domain in EHD proteins , AtEH / Pan1 proteins harbor two EH domains and we asked if both EH domains serve as independent functional modules . We therefore set out to characterize the function of the AtEH / Pan1 EH domain containing proteins in Arabidopsis . In this study , we used a multidisciplinary approach to perform a structural and functional side - by - side comparison of both EH domains of AtEH1 / Pan1 . Results and Discussion Structural characterization of both EH domains of AtEH1 / Pan1 reveals a common fold AtEH / Pan1 proteins are highly unstructured but three domains can be identified ; a coiled - coil domain implicated in dimerization ( Sánchez - Rodríguez et al . , 2018 ) and two N - terminal Eps15 homology ( EH ) domains ( Figure 1 , panel a ) . Comparing the EH domains within each AtEH / Pan1 protein shows low sequence identity which is in contrast to the high sequence identity when comparing the EH domains between AtEH1 / Pan1 and AtEH2 / Pan1 ( Figure 1 , panel a ; Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Therefore , we decided to focus on both EH domains of AtEH1 / Pan1 as representatives , which we hereafter name EH1 . 1 and EH1 . 2 . To structurally characterize both EH domains of AtEH1 / Pan1 , we expressed recombinant proteins in E . coli and purified highly monodisperse samples for X - ray crystallography and NMR ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Crystals of EH1 . 1 diffracted synchrotron X - rays to 1 . 55Å resolution and enabled structure determination via molecular replacement ( PDB : 6YIG ) . EH1 . 1 consists of two EF - hands connected by a short antiparallel β - sheet ( Figure 1 , panel b ) . Anomalous scattering supports a calcium ion bound in a pentagonal - bipyramidal geometry in the loop of the first EF - hand ( Figure 1 , panel d ; Supplementary figure 1 ) . No anomalous scattering signal was detected in the second EF - hand loop , but electron density consistent with the coordination of a sodium ion was present ( Figure 1 , panel c ) . While attempts to crystallize EH1 . 2 proved unsuccessful , and as part of an integrative structural biology approach , we obtained structural insights for both EH1 . 1 ( PDB : 6YEU ) and EH1 . 2 ( PDB : 6YET ) , in solution , by NMR ( Evangelidis et al . , 2018 ) . With respect to EH1 . 2 , the NMR and X - ray structures agree very well with an RMSD of 1Å ( compared by the Dali algorithm ( ( Holm , 2019 ) ) . When comparing the NMR structures of EH1 . 1 and EH1 . 2 , the RMSD between both domains is 2 . 6Å ( compared by the Dali algorithm ( ( Holm , 2019 ) ) . In general , the EH1 . 1 and EH1 . 2 domains have a very conserved hydrophobic core , a common feature of EH domains . The major difference in the fold is at the interaction interface of the N - and C - terminal ends . The hydrophobic core in EH1 . 1 is shielded by the proline - rich C - terminal loop , while in EH1 . 2 , the proline - rich N - terminal loop takes over this function . The second EH domain coordinates two calcium ions We were intrigued by the fact that , in contrast to EH1 . 1 , EH1 . 2 contains two possible calcium - binding sites . This is manifested by a classical calcium - binding motif ( DxDxDxxxxxE ) in the second loop of EH1 . 2 and a second possible coordination motif in the first loop , where the final glutamate , in the canonical calcium - ligation cassette , is substituted by glutamine in arabidopsis . However , sequence alignment ( supplemental data ) revealed that most monocots have glutamate at this position , strongly suggesting calcium coordination in this position . To obtain a possible coordination scheme for arabidopsis we performed an extensive all - atom molecular dynamics simulation ( 3 μs , CHARMM force - field ) ( Figure 1 , panel e - g , Supplementary Figure 2 ) . Experimental interrogation of this possibility by total X - ray reflection fluorescence confirmed the presence of two calcium ions in the EH1 . 2 domain ( Figure 1 , panel h ) . To our knowledge , the ability of EH domains to coordinate two calcium ions has not been described before . The all - atom molecular dynamics model , within its time and forcefield limitations , suggests that the first aspartate and the presence of an extra water molecule compensate for the incomplete calcium - binding motif in the first loop of EH1 . 2 and functionally mimics the role of the canonical glutamate in the calcium - binding motif . Restoring the first EF - hand loop to a canonical EF - hand ( Q382E ) , in an all - atom molecular dynamics simulation , resulted in a classical arrangement where glutamate coordinates calcium in a bidentate fashion ( Supplementary figure 2 ) . We confirmed by NMR and size exclusion chromatography that EH1 . 2 is indeed more sensitive to precipitation upon calcium chelation compared to EH1 . 1 ( Figure 1 , panel i - j and Supplemental Figure 3 ) . This is consistent with our findings that EH . 2 coordinates two calcium ions . Addition of an excess amount of calcium allowed refolding of the precipitated domains ( Supplemental Figure 3 ) . The ability to unfold and refold , relating to a non - functional versus a functional state , in a calcium - dependent manner , hints at a modulatory role for calcium to control the function of this domain . The second EH domain interacts with charged lipids EH domains have been proposed to act as a protein interaction hub and / or as a lipid - binding module ( Naslavsky et al . , 2007 ; Paoluzi et al . , 1998 ) . To unravel the function of the EH domains of AtEH1 / Pan1 , we tested both domains for their ability to bind peptide motifs and membranes , in a pairwise manner . AtEH / Pan1 proteins mainly function at the negatively charged plasma membrane or the ER - PM contact sites ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2019 ) . To mimic a negatively charged plasma membrane environment in vitro we performed liposome binding experiments using a mixture of phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) with or without 10 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Only EH1 . 2 bound to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 enriched liposomes ( Figure 2 , panel a ) . We hypothesized that evolutionary conserved lysine and arginine residues at the surface of EH1 . 2 would result in an electrostatically driven membrane interaction ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . To test our hypothesis we performed liposome binding experiments comparing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with PI3P and PI4P enriched liposomes . We observed a very weak interaction with PI3P and PI4P compared to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 liposomes ( Figure 2 , panel b ) . PolyPiPosome assays confirmed our findings ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) , along with conservation of specific lysine and arginine residues in the EH domains of Eps15 ( EH2 ) and EHD1 ( EH1 ) , both known for their involvement in binding negatively charged lipid head groups ( Naslavsky et al . , 2007 ) ( Figure 2 , panel c ) . The lipid interacting residues in the EH domains of EHD1 and Eps15 are structurally conserved in EH1 . 2 ( K391 and K398 ) , whereas no lysine or arginine residues are present at those positions in EH1 . 1 ( Figure 2 , panel d ) . In addition to the published interacting residues , we hypothesize a third residue , K384 , might also play a role in lipid interaction as it is located close to the known interacting surface and is structurally conserved in lipid binding EH domains ( Figure 2 , panel c ) . Our analysis supports that the EH1 . 2 interaction with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 liposomes is electrostatically driven and might be in vivo further enhanced via avidity effects through dimerization of the AtEH1 / Pan1 coiled - coil domain ( Sánchez - Rodríguez et al . , 2018 ) . Given the fact that , on the one hand , calcium is needed for the fold of EH1 . 2 and , on the other hand , that the lipid interaction is electrostatically - driven , we tested the effect of different calcium concentrations on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding by the EH1 . 2 domain . We observed increased binding of EH1 . 2 at lower calcium concentrations ( Figure 2 , panel e ) . Our results are in line with prior studies showing that high calcium concentrations block the accessibility of charged lipids by shielding and re - arranging the lipid headgroups ( Bilkova et al . , 2017 ) . To address the lipid - binding capacity in planta , we assessed if the targetting of AtEH1 / Pan1 to the plasma membrane depends on PI4P binding , as no potent compound exists to disrupt PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentrations in vivo . We used short term ( 30min ) , 30µM phenyl arsine oxide ( PAO ) treatment , shown to specifically affect PI4P levels at the PM ( Simon et al . , 2014 ) . In contrast to the PI4P marker ( PH FAPP1 - GFP ) , PAO treatment did not disrupt the AtEH1 / Pan1 PM localization indicating that PI4P is not of major importance for the plasma membrane targeting of AtEH1 / Pan1 ( Figure 2 , panel f - h ) . The first EH domain recognises a novel retrograde transport motif To identify protein interaction partners of the AtEH1 / Pan1 EH domains , we sought to discover interaction motifs . To this end , we digested arabidopsis seedling proteome and incubated the peptide mix with each EH domain or with GFP as a control . Comparative mass spectrometry identified bound peptides . The N - terminal double NPF peptide of SCAMP5 was identified as a significant hit with EH1 . 1 . This peptide also showed the hightes fold change compared to EH1 . 2 and GFP ( Figure 3 , panel a ) . Secretory Carrier Membrane Protein 5 ( SCAMP5 ) is part of a five - membered protein family in arabidopsis . SCAMP proteins were first characterized in mammals for their role in endocytosis ( Fernández - Chacón et al . , 2000 ) . Current insights in the animal and plant field show a broader function of SCAMPs in plasma membrane phase separation , cell plate formation , and pathogen - induced stomatal closure ( Bourdais et al . , 2019 ; Lam et al . , 2008 ; Park et al . , 2018 ) . SCAMP5 was also previously identified to reside in close proximity to TPC by proximity labelling ( Arora et al . , 2020 ) . No peptides derived from integral membrane proteins were identified among the few specific interactors of EH1 . 2 ( Bateman et al . , 2018 ; Letunic and Bork , 2017 ) . Bio - Layer Interferometry ( BLI ) confirmed the interaction between EH1 . 1 and a peptide derived from the N - terminus of SCAMP5 with a binding affinity ( K d ) of 59µM via steady - state kinetics ( Figure 3 , panel b ) . Both NPF stretches of the N - terminus of SCAMP5 are required to bind EH1 . 1 , as no binding affinity for mutated NPF to AAA mutants could be determined ( Figure 3 , panel b ) . The interaction between the double NPF motif is much stronger for EH1 . 1 ( K d , app ~ 33µM ) compared to EH1 . 2 ( K d , app ~ 190 µM ) by NMR titration experiments ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . NMR peptide titration experiments provided the binding sites of the peptide on both EH domains . Published structures of EH domains interacting with NPF - motifs show the importance of the central tryptophan and its surrounding hydrophobic residues for which in EH1 . 1 , but not EH1 . 2 , the largest chemical shift perturbations were observed ( Beer et al . , 2000 ; Kieken et al . , 2009 ; Rumpf et al . , 2008 ) ( Figure 3 , panel c - d , Supplementary Figure 6 ) . Comparison of chemical shift perturbation of EH1 . 1 with evolutionary conservation across a variety of plant species showed that most of the residues responsible for NPF binding are strongly conserved ( Figure 3 , panel e ) . Mutating the conserved tryptophan to alanine in EH1 . 1 and testing its binding capacity by BLI confirmed its essential role . No binding was observed for the mutated EH1 . 1 domain ( Figure 3 , panel b ) . We conclude that the N - terminal double NPF motif of SCAMP5 interacts specifically with EH1 . 1 via a hydrophobic interaction mediated by the conserved tryptophan residue . To address the physiological relevance of the interaction between SCAMP5 and AtEH1 / Pan1 in planta , we analyzed A . thaliana roots expressing SCAMP5 - GFP and AtEH1 / Pan1 - mRuby3 via confocal microscopy . SCAMP5 localizes mostly in endosomes and weakly at the plasma membrane ( Supplemental figure 7 ) . Co - localization with AtEH1 / Pan1 at the PM was observed . Both proteins also prominently co - localize during various stages of cell plate formation where SCAMP5 clearly precedes the arrival of AtEH1 / Pan1 . However , the presence of AtEH1 / Pan1 at the newly formed cross wall exceeds SCAMP5 following completion of cytokinesis ( Figure 3 , panel f ) . Altogether our data suggest that SCAMP5 trafficking is highly dynamic . Short - term ES - 9 treatment , a potent endocytic inhibitor ( Dejonghe et al . , 2016 ) , caused SCAMP5 accumulation at the PM ( Supplemental Figure 7 ) , indicating the endocytic contribution to SCAMP5 dynamics . To further elucidate the role of the AtEH1 / Pan1 - SCAMP5 interaction in vivo , we compared the localization of the native SCAMP5 protein with an N - terminally truncated version ( i . e . lacking the double NPF motif ) . In comparison to the wild type protein , the ΔN - SCAMP5 showed a reduced endosomal and an increased plasma membrane localization ( Figure 3 , panel g - h ) . Altogether , these results corroborate our hypothesis that the double NPF motif is a recruitment signal that is involved in the retrograde transport of SCAMP5 . In conclusion , our parallel structural and functional comparison of the EH domains of AtEH / Pan1 revealed two divergent EH domains with differential , yet complementary functions . The first EH domain binds a novel TPC interactor , SCAMP5 , via its N - terminal double NPF motif . This constitutes a novel retrograde transport signal in plants . The second EH domain is involved in the recognition of negatively charged phospholipids . The tandem EH domains in AtEH1 / Pan1 , a recurring leitmotif in the endocytic machinery in Eukarya , is a clear example of evolutionary division of labour of a repetitive protein fold .

Materials and methods Multiple sequence alignment To obtain protein sequences of AtEH / Pan1 homologs , GenBank ( https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / genbank / ) , Joint Genome Institute ( https : / / genome . jgi . doe . gov / portal / ) , EnsemblPlants ( https : / / plants . ensembl . org / index . html ) and Congenie ( http : / / congenie . org / start ) databases were used for a BLASTP search ( Altschul et al . , 1990 ) . See supplemental sequence file for a complete list of all organisms searched ( 51 different plant genomes in total ) . A multiple alignment was constructed with the masfft algorithm in einsi mode ( Katoh et al . , 2017 ) . Protein production and purification EH domains of AtEH1 / Pan1 were amplified from the pDONR plasmid containing the full - length AtEH1 / Pan1 coding sequence ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ) and cloned by restriction digestion ( Nde / Xho ) into the pET22b plasmid , generously donated by the lab of S . N . Savvides ( IRC , VIB / UGent , BE ) . The final constructs have an N - terminal His - tag followed by a TEV - protease cleavage site and contain amino acids , 1 - 107 ( EH1 . 1 ) and 346 - 449 ( EH1 . 2 ) . To generate the tryptophan mutant in EH1 . 1 , the complete plasmid was amplified using primers over the tryptophan - containing sequence . The fragment was re - assembled using NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix ( NEB ) . Constructs were transformed into BL21 ( DE3 ) ( # C2527H , NEB ) . Cells were grown at 37°C in LB + medium and induced by the addition of 0 . 4mM IPTG at OD 0 . 6 for 5h . To obtain isotope labelled proteins , cells were grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0 . 5g / L N 15 H 4 Cl and / or 2g / L 13 C - glucose ( Eurisotop ) . Proteins were extracted using sonication in 20mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 2mM CaCl 2 and Protease inhibitors ( cOmplete ULTRA EDTA - free , Roche ) , except for proteins analyzed by the size exclusion chromatography multi - angle laser light scattering , for which no CaCl 2 was added during the purification . Purification was performed on an ÄKTA ( GE Healthcare ) system by subsequent purification using a HisPrep FF 16 / 10 ( GE Healthcare ) followed by a gel filtration step ( HiLoad® 16 / 600 Superdex® 75 pg ( GE Healthcare ) ) . When no His - tag was required the protein was incubated overnight with 1 / 40 protein : his - TEV - protease ( own production , the expression strain was a gift from the lab of S . Savvides ( IRC , VIB / Ugent , BE ) ) at room temperature without shaking . Uncleaved protein and protease were removed via reverse IMAC ( 1ml HisTRAP FF ( GE Healthcare ) followed by gel filtration ( HiLoad® 16 / 600 Superdex® 75 pg ( GE Healthcare ) ) . The protein sequence of EH1 . 1 and EH1 . 2 along with there native molecular weight were verified by MS analysis . GFP - His in an OPINF backbone ( a generous gift from the lab of Ray Owen , OPPF , UK ) was produced and purified as the EH domains without the addition of CaCl 2 . Multi - Angle Laser Light Scattering Purified His - tagged proteins EH1 . 1 ( 1mg / ml ) or EH1 . 2 ( 2mg / ml ) were injected onto a Superdex 75 Increase 10 / 300 GL size exclusion column ( GE Healthcare ) , equilibrated with 20mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 300mM NaCl , coupled to an online UV - detector ( Shimadzu ) , a mini DAWN TREOS ( Wyatt ) multi - angle laser light scattering detector and an Optilab T - rEX refractometer ( Wyatt ) at room temperature . A refractive index increment ( dn / dc ) value of 0 . 185 ml / g was used . Band broadening corrections were applied using parameters derived from BSA injected under identical running conditions . Data analysis was carried out using the ASTRA6 . 1 software . Protein crystallization of EH1 . 1 Commercial sparse matrix sitting drop crystallization screens were set up using a Mosquito liquid handling robot ( TTP Labtech ) using a 100nl : 100nl , protein ( 12mg / ml ) : mother liquor geometry in SwissSci 96 - well triple drop plates . Plates were incubated at 293 K . An original hit in the JCSG screen ( 1 . 1M SodiumMalonate , 0 . 1M HEPES pH 7 , 0 . 5 % Jeffamine ) was optimized to 100mM HEPES pH 7 . 6 , 0 . 8M SodiumMalonate , 0 . 5 % Jeffamine . Crystals were cryoprotected by the addition of ethylene glycol ( 15 % v / v ) to the mother liquor prior to plunging the crystals in liquid nitrogen for cryo - cooling prior to data collection . Crystallographic structure determination X - ray diffraction data were collected from single crystals at 100 K at the P14 microfocus beamline operated by the EMBL at PETRA III synchrotron ( Hamburg , Germany ) . All data were integrated and scaled using XDS ( Kabsch , 2010 ) . The initial phases were generated by Automatic Molecular Replacement Pipeline ( MoRDa ) ( Vagin and Lebedev , 2015 ) using a search model derived from the X - ray structure of mouse EHD2 ( 2QPT ) . The initial structure was rebuilt with ARP / wARP ( Langer et al . , 2008 ) and further structure building and refinement was performed using Buster ( version 2 . 10 . 3 ) ( Bricogne et al . , 2018 ) followed by iterative use of COOT ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) and Phenix . refine ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) software packages . NMR structure determination of EH1 . 1 and EH1 . 2 For NMR structure determination the proteins were buffer exchanged using PD - 10 columns ( Sephadex G - 25 M , GE Healthcare ) or via gel filtration chromatography in the final purification step to 20mM MES 6 . 5 , 150mM NaCl , 2mM CaCl 2 . All NMR spectra were recorded at CEITEC Josef Dadok National NMR Centre on 850 MHz Bruker Avance III spectrometer equipped with 1H / 13C / 15N TCI cryogenic probehead with z - axis gradients . For each protein a set of three sparsely sampled 4D NMR experiments was acquired : 4D HC ( CC - TOCSY ( CO ) ) NH , 4D 13 C , 15 N edited HMQC - NOESY - HSQC ( HCNH ) , and 4D 13 C , 13 C edited HMQC - NOESY - HSQC ( HCCH ) . Sequential and aliphatic side chain assignments were obtained automatically using the 4D - CHAINS algorithm that combines through - bond information from the 4D - TOCSY experiment and distance information from the 4D - NOESY ( HCNH ) experiment ( Evangelidis et al . , 2018 ) . Aromatic sidechain frequencies were assigned manually by recording an additional 3D 13 C edited NOESY - HSQC experiment . Assignment completeness reached 99 % for each EH domain . Backbone dihedral angle restraints were derived from TALOS using a combination of five kinds ( H N , H α , C α , C β , N ) of chemical shift assignments for each residue in the sequence ( Shen et al . , 2009 ) . NOE cross - peaks from the three NOESY spectra were assigned automatically by CYANA 3 . 0 in structure calculations with torsion angle dynamics ( Güntert , 2008 ) . Unambiguous distance restraints and torsion angle restraints ( Supplementary Table 2 ) were used in a water refinement calculation ( Linge et al . , 2003 ) applying the RECOORD protocol ( Nederveen et al . , 2005 ) . The CNS patch introducing calcium coordination in a pentagonal bipyramidal configuration was prepared manually . CNS topology files for calcium coordination were generated based on the high - resolution crystal structure of calmodulin ( PDB : 1CLL ) . The quality of the NMR - derived structure ensembles was validated using PSVS ( Bhattacharya et al . , 2006 ) . All - atom molecular dynamics simulations of Ca 2 + - binding All - atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the GROMACS 5 . 1 . 2 package ( Abraham et al . , 2015 ) . The simulation box contained one EH1 . 2 or EH1 . 2 Q382E molecule placed in a cubic box with a length of ~ 8 nm , which was filled with a 150 mM NaCl aqueous solution and which included additional Cl - ions to neutralize the whole system . The protein and ions were parameterized using the CHARMM36 force field ( Huang and MacKerell , 2013 ) . Newton’s equations of motion were integrated by employing the leap - frog algorithm ( Hockney et al . , 1974 ) with a time step of 2fs . The trajectory frames were recorded every 10ps . A cutoff of 1 . 2nm was applied to short - range electrostatic interactions while long - range electrostatics was calculated with the use of the particle mesh Ewald method ( Darden et al . , 1993 ) . Van der Waals potentials were decreased so that the forces went smoothly to zero between 1 . 0 and 1 . 2nm . Bonds with hydrogen atoms were constrained by the LINCS algorithm ( Hess et al . , 1997 ) and water molecules were kept rigid by the SETTLE algorithm ( Miyamoto and Kollman , 1992 ) . The temperature of the system was maintained at 310K using the velocity rescaling thermostat with a stochastic term ( Bussi et al . , 2008 ) and the Parrinello – Rahman barostat ( Parrinello and Rahman , 1981 ) was utilized for semi - isotropic pressure coupling with a reference pressure of 1 . 01bar . The time constants of the thermostat and barostat were 1ps and 5ps . TXRF The EH domains were buffer exchanged using PD - 10 columns to a buffer containing 20mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 0 . 5mM CaCl 2 . The proteins were concentrated to 2mM and the achieved protein concentration was verified by Nanodrop . TXRF quartz substrate disks were cleaned by placing them in a closed beaker with 5 % HNO 3 solution under boiling conditions for half an hour . This cleaning process was then repeated using a 3 % HNO 3 solution , rinsed twice using MilliQ H 2 O and a final rinse using a MilliQ H2O – ethanol solution and dried in vacuum . Five replicates for each EH domain consisting of 10 µL of the same protein solution were spotted on a quartz disk and dried under vacuum . The samples were measured in a G . N . R . TX2000 total reflection X - ray fluorescence spectrometer ( 40 kV , 30 mA , 1000 s LT , Mo anode ) . XRF data were fitted using the AXIL software package ( Vekemans et al . 1994 ) . Ca - Ka integrated intensities were normalized for the Cl - Ka integrated intensities to account for small fluctuations in X - ray tube current and amount of probed sample volume . Precipitation and refolding assays To monitor precipitation and refolding by size exclusion chromatography , EH domains were treated with 10mM EGTA during 15 minutes , centrifuged at 10000g for 5min to remove precipitation and the soluble fraction was injected on a Superdex 75 10 / 300 ( GE Healthcare ) . To refold EH domains , proteins were precipitated with 10mM EGTA and refolded overnight at room temperature by the addition of 50mM CaCl 2 . Proteins were injected on a Superdex 75 10 / 300 ( GE Healthcare ) to check the folded state of the protein . To analyze the refolding of EH1 . 2 over time the protein was precipitated , in triplicate , using 10mM EDTA for 15 min while shaking followed by the addition of CaCl 2 to a final concentration of 5 or 50mM after which the optical density at 600nm ( Versamax , Molecular Devices ) was measured over time . Liposome binding experiments For the liposome binding experiments , a vesicle co - sedimentation assay was used as described in ( Kooijman et al . , 2007 ) . The binding buffer was adapted to 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl and a variable amount of CaCl 2 was used . PolyPIPosome binding experiments 5µg protein was mixed with 40µl PolyPIPosomes ( Echelon Biosciences ) in a total volume of 80µl in a final buffer , constituted of 20mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 0 . 1mM CaCl 2 and incubated for 1h at room temperature . After 1h , 30µl Monomeric Avidin Agarose beads ( Pierce™ ) were added and incubated for 1h . The beads were spun down and washed three times with buffer . Liposomes were eluted from the beads by boiling at 95°C for five minutes after the addition of 10x sample reducing agent ( Nupage , NP0009 ) and 4x Laemmli sample buffer ( Biorad , # 1610747 ) . Live cell imaging and chemical treatments Root epidermal cells of 5 - 7 day old seedlings , grown vertically on ½ MS medium in continuous light were imaged on a Leica SP8X microscope using the white light laser with a 40x / 1 . 1NA water - immersion lens . For sequential dual - color imaging , EGFP was visualized using 488nm laser excitation and a 495 - 550nm spectral detection . mRuby was visualised using 558nm laser excitation and a 600 - 700nm spectral detection . Time gating was always applied except for imaging FM4 - 64 . For PAO treatments seedlings were treated for 30min with 30µM PAO ( Sigma , P3075 , lot # MKCJ0095 ) in ½ MS media . For control experiments the same concentration of DMSO was used instead of PAO . For ES9 treatment plants were pretreated for 5min with 10µM ES9 , a generous gift of the lab of Jenny Russinova ( PSB , VIB / Ugent , BE ) , in ½ MS media followed by 30min co - treatment of ES9 with 2µM FM4 - 64 . PM / cytoplasm quantification For the quantification of plasma membrane versus cytoplasm , the Fiji software package ( v1 . 52p ) was used . The 5 % most intense pixelsof the ROI covering the PM were divided by the 5 % most intense pixels of the ROI inside of the cell . Only images devoid of saturated pixels were used for quantification . Statistical analysis For statistical analysis , the R package in R studio was used . Data were tested for normality and heteroscedasticity after which the multcomp package was used ( Herberich et al . , 2010 ) . Peptidome profiling Arabidopsis ( Col - 0 ) was grown vertically on ½ MS media for 7 days on a nylon mesh , harvested and flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen . Frozen seedlings ( 3g / experiment ) were ground using mortar and pestle . Proteins were extracted and denatured in 50mM NaHCO 3 , 8M Urea and sonicated three times for 1min . Protein extracts were rotated for 30min at room temperature after which the extract was subsequently centrifuged twice at 20 . 000g for 20min . DTT was added to the supernatant , was added to a final concentration of 5mM and incubated at 55°C for 30min . Proteins were alkylated by the addition of 100mM iodoacetamide and incubated for 15min in the dark after which the mix was subsequently diluted with 50mM NaHCO 3 to a final concentration of 2M urea . Trypsin was added in a ratio of 1 : 75 , protein : trypsin ( Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin , V5117 , Promega ) and incubated overnight at 37°C on a rotating wheel . Trypsin was removed using Sep - Pak Vac 3cc columns ( 500mg , WAT036815 , Waters ) . The extract was acidified using 1 % TFA for 15min on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 1780g for 15min at room temperature . The cleared extract was split into four and applied on an equilibrated Sep - Pak columns ( Waters , WAT036815 , Lot # 010437235B ) . The column was pre - wet using 5ml of 100 % MeCN followed by sequential washing with 1 ml , 3 ml , and 6 ml of 0 . 1 % TFA . After application of the extract , the column was washed sequentially with 1 ml , 5 ml , and 6 ml of 0 . 1 % TFA followed by a 2ml wash with 0 . 1 % TFA , 5 % acetonitrile . The peptides were eluted using three times 2ml 0 . 1 % TFA , 40 % acetonitrile . The eluate was lyophilized for two days to remove TFA . 200µg EH domain or his - GFP were coupled , in triplicate , during one hour to 25µl Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads ( GE Healthcare , 17 - 5318 - 01 ) . Unbound protein was removed by three washing steps of 1ml each . The lyophilized peptides were solubilized in 20mM HEPES , 150mM NaCl buffer , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 , divided and added to the coupled beads . The peptidome was incubated with the proteins for 4h after which the beads were washed three times with 1ml binding buffer . Peptides were eluted by the addition of 80µl 20mM HEPES pH 8 , 8M Urea . The supernatant was removed from the beads and desalted with Monospin C18 columns ( Agilent Technologies , A57003100 ) as described in ( Leene et al . , 2019 ) . Peptides were re - dissolved in 20 µl loading solvent A ( 0 . 1 % TFA in water / ACN ( 98 : 2 , v / v ) ) of which 5µl was injected for LC - MS / MS analysis on an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano LC ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Bremen , Germany ) in - line connected to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The peptides were first loaded on a trapping column made in - house ( 100 μm internal diameter ( I . D . ) × 20 mm , 5 μm beads C18 Reprosil - HD , Dr . Maisch , Ammerbuch - Entringen , Germany ) and after flushing from the trapping column the peptides were separated on a 50 cm µPAC™ column with C18 - endcapped functionality ( Pharmafluidics , Belgium ) kept at a constant temperature of 35°C . Peptides were eluted by a linear gradient from 98 % solvent A’ ( 0 . 1 % formic acid in water ) to 55 % solvent B’ ( 0 . 1 % formic acid in water / acetonitrile , 20 / 80 ( v / v ) ) in 30min at a flow rate of 300 nL / min , followed by a 5min wash reaching 99 % solvent B’ . The mass spectrometer was operated in data - dependent , positive ionization mode , automatically switching between MS and MS / MS acquisition for the 5 most abundant peaks in a given MS spectrum . The source voltage was 2 . 2kV , and the capillary temperature was 250°C . One MS1 scan ( m / z 400−2 , 000 , AGC target 3 × 10 6 ions , maximum ion injection time 80 ms ) , acquired at a resolution of 70 , 000 ( at 200 m / z ) , was followed by up to 5 tandem MS scans ( resolution 17 , 500 at 200 m / z ) of the most intense ions fulfilling predefined selection criteria ( AGC target 5 × 10 4 ions , maximum ion injection time 80ms , isolation window 2Da , fixed first mass 140 m / z , spectrum data type : centroid , intensity threshold 1 . 3xE 4 , exclusion of unassigned , 1 , 5 - 8 , > 8 positively charged precursors , peptide match preferred , exclude isotopes on , dynamic exclusion time 12s ) . The HCD collision energy was set to 25 % Normalized Collision Energy and the polydimethylcyclosiloxane background ion at 445 . 120025Da was used for internal calibration ( lock mass ) . The raw files were processed with the MaxQuant software ( version 1 . 6 . 4 . 0 ) ( Cox and Mann , 2008 ) , and searched with the built - in Andromeda search engine against the TAIR10 _ pep _ 20101214 database . Parameters can be found in the MS data file . Intensity values from the peptides output ﬁle of MaxQuant were used for quantitative analysis with the Perseus software ( version 1 . 6 . 1 . 1 ) . Intensity values were transformed to log2 values . Rows were filtered for at least 2 valid values in one of the sample groups , GFP , EH1 . 1 or EH1 . 2 . Missing values were replaced with values from normal distribution with width of 0 . 3 and a downshift of 1 . 8 . To determine the significantly enriched peptide sequences with the EH1 domains , a two - sided Student’s t test was performed between each of the EH domains versus GFP and the other EH domain as control . Permutation - based correction for multiple hypothesis testing was performed with thresholds FDR = 0 . 01 and S0 = 1 . NMR peptide binding NPF peptide was dissolved in the final NMR buffer at a stock concentration of 4mM . 1 H , 15 N HSQC titrations of 15 N - labeled EH1 . 1 or EH1 . 2 with successive addition of unlabeled ligands were performed on samples containing 100 mM protein to a final concentration ratio of 1 : 4 excess of the peptide . Weighted chemical shift perturbations ( CSP ) were calculated as : 𝐶𝑆𝑃 = √ δ 𝐻 𝑁 2 + δ 𝑁2 6 2 The CSPs were fitted to a binding isotherm using the equation : 𝐶𝑆𝑃 = 𝐶𝑆𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥 [ 2𝑃 𝑇 ] ( [ 𝐿 ] + [ 𝑃 𝑇 ] + 𝐾 𝐷 − √ ( [ 𝐿 ] + [ 𝑃 𝑇 ] + 𝐾 𝐷 ) 2 − 4 [ 𝑃 𝑇 ] [ 𝐿 ] ) where CSP is the chemical shift perturbation at a given peptide concentration [ L ] , CSP max is the chemical shift perturbation at saturation , [ P T ] is the total protein concentration , and K D , the dissociation constant . BLI BLI experiments were performed on an Octet RED96 instrument ( FortéBio ) using an HBS buffer supplemented with calcium ( 20mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 2mM CaCl 2 ) . A shake speed of 1000rpm at 25°C was used during all measurements . Ni - NTA ( Molecular devices , 18 - 5102 ) biosensors were functionalized with EH - domains ( 10µg / ml ) till a coupling signal of 3nm was reached . The proteins were covalently coupled to the Ni - NTA biosensors by sequentially dipping in a 20mM EDC : 10mM NHS mix for 60 seconds followed by 60 seconds quenching in 1M ethanolamine pH 8 . 5 . The coupled tips were equilibrated in buffer before the addition of the analyte . Next , functionalized sensors were sequentially dipped in increasing concentrations of analyte with an association time of 60s and a dissociation time of 120s . To correct for bulk effects during the measurements we performed double reference subtraction . Here , non - functionalized sensors were exposed to the same analyte concentrations while a functionalized sensor was dipped in zero concentration of analyte . The reference traces were subtracted from the raw data before analysis . Req values used in the analysis were determined for each concentration by averaging 30 data points once the sensors achieved stable equilibrium . Graphpad was used to analyse and plot binding data using the one - site total binding model . Peptides were ordered from Peptide 2 . 0 ( 95 % purity ) . Visualisation of protein structures and data For the visualisation of all protein structures UCSF Chimera was used . Mapping of conserved residues was performed by combining the Consurf server ( Ashkenazy et al . , 2016 ) with the generated alignment for the individual domains .
