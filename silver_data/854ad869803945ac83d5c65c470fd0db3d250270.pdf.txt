Durable protein lattices of clathrin that can be functionalized with nanoparticles and active biomolecules P . N . Dannhauser 1 , 2 * † , M . Platen 3 † , H . Böning 1 and I . A . T . Schaap 3 , 4 Biological molecules that self - assemble and interact with other molecules are attractive building blocks for engineering biologi - cal devices . DNA has been widely used for the creation of nano - materials 1 , but the use of proteins remains largely unexplored . Here , we show that clathrin can form homogeneous and extended two - dimensional lattices on a variety of substrates , including glass , metal , carbon and plastic . Clathrin is a three - legged protein complex with unique self - assembling properties and is relevant in the formation of membrane transport vesicles in eukaryotic cells 2 , 3 . We used a fragment of the adaptor protein epsin to immobilize clathrin lattices on the substrates . The lattices span multiple square millimetres with a regular periodicity of 30 nm and can be functionalized via modi ﬁ ed subunits of clathrin with either inorganic nanoparticles or active enzymes . The lattices can be stored for months after crosslinking and stabilization with uranyl acetate . They could be dehydrated and rehydrated without loss of function , offering potential applications in sensing and as biosynthetic reactors . DNA has seen an impressive increase in its application as a con - struction material . By making use of its base pair speci ﬁ city , nano - metre - sized three - dimensional structures can be assembled 4 . A more recent development is DNA origami 5 , which allows the prep - aration of micrometre - sized two - dimensional sheets that can be used for the controlled arrangement of molecules 6 , 7 . Proteins offer many more possibilities to include speci ﬁ c interactions with other molecules and for chemical modi ﬁ cations . However , their complex - ity makes controlled assembly into larger structures a major chal - lenge 8 , 9 . The formation of two - dimensional sheets from proteins is very limited , with bacterial S - layer , crysalins and ferritin - cage lat - tices remaining notable exceptions 10 – 12 . The speci ﬁ c functionaliza - tion of protein sheets is therefore a largely uninvestigated ﬁ eld . The basic building block in clathrin lattices is a three - legged protein complex , the triskelion ( Fig . 1a ) , which is composed of three clathrin heavy chains ( CHC ) , each tightly associated with one regulatory clathrin light chain ( CLC ) 3 , 13 . A prominent feature of triskelia is their propensity to self - assemble into regular three - dimensional lattices . This drives vesicle formation by enclosing membranes in polyhedral cages consisting of both hexagons and pentagons 2 , 14 . During vesicle formation , adaptor proteins such as epsin speci ﬁ cally recruit clathrin to membranes and connect cargo ( for example , cellular receptors ) within the membrane to the assem - bling clathrin lattice . Clathrin has also been found to form patches of planar lattices in living cells and in vitro 14 , 15 . Predominantly hex - agonal lattices can be observed as clathrin assembles onto the sur - faces of substrates that resist bending . In recent work , we used this to quantify the mechanical reinforcing of these lattices by CLC 16 . To immobilize clathrin lattices ( ‘ clathrin ’ and ‘ triskelia ’ refer to CHC + CLC ) on substrates we used a fragment of the adaptor protein epsin ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . This fragment ( H 6 - epsin 144 - 575 ) comprises two clathrin - binding motives but lacks the lipid - binding epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain . The clathrin lattices can span multiple square millimetres and show a regular periodicity of 30 nm . Lattices can also be formed of CHC alone , which allows the use of the CLC as a speci ﬁ c linker to connect particles or enzymes . To apply these clathrin lattices in biotechnology it is essential to identify onto which materials lattices can be formed . We found that clathrin self - assembles on a wide variety of surfaces , including gra - phene , polymers , glass and metals ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . 1b , c ) . Uniform lattice assembly required negatively charged sur - faces , which were obtained by air plasma treatment ( Fig . 1c ) . Lattices can be formed in a pH range between 6 and 8 . However , Tris or Triton X100 at low concentrations ( 50 mM and 0 . 1 % , respectively ) , as well as very high non - physiological salt concentrations ( > 250 mM ) , inhibited self - assembly . For the recycling of nanotechnological devices and the implementation of cyclic production processes , the ability to regen - erate protein lattices would be highly advantageous . It has been shown that low concentrations of the chaotropic salt sodium thio - cyanate ( NaSCN ) impede three - dimensional clathrin assembly 17 . In Fig . 2a we show that NaSCN can be used to reversibly remodel clathrin two - dimensional lattices . Incubation for 5 s with 0 . 05 M NaSCN disordered the lattice . A substantial recovery , after NaSCN removal , indicates that clathrin largely remained attached to the surface . This was further supported by Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) experiments , in which a subset of the triske - lia was labelled with ﬂ uorescent dyes via the CLC ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Following addition of 0 . 05 M NaSCN , the FRET ef ﬁ ciency dropped and partially recovered after NaSCN removal . Because of the tight binding of CLC to CHC and the obser - vation that the CLC conformation is linked to the CHC assem - bly 18 , 19 , the changes in FRET ef ﬁ ciency are expected to re ﬂ ect the reorganization of the whole network . Longer incubation times or higher concentrations of NaSCN cause more pronounced clathrin dissociation from the surface , and the addition of new triskelia was necessary to restore the lattice ( Fig . 2a ) . NaSCN can therefore be either used to disrupt the clathrin lattice or to remove it com - pletely from the surface . This turns the lattice into a controllable surface modi ﬁ cation for cyclic applications .

All rights reserved layer , which connects the lattice to the substrate , proved to be very robust and is unaffected by the 1 M NaSCN treatment . To further assess the durability of the H 6 - epsin 144 – 575 coating , we tested whether it retains its functionality after a complete dehy - dration step . A carbon ﬁ lm was coated with H 6 - epsin 144 - 575 , washed with deionized water , blotted and left to dry for 30 min at 37 °C . Subsequent rehydration and incubation with clathrin resulted in regular lattices ( Fig . 3a ) , which shows that H 6 - epsin 144 - 575 - coated surfaces can be dried and stored for longer periods of time without losing their functionality . For many applications it is essential for a lattice to remain func - tional over an extended period of time . However , the unmodi ﬁ ed clathrin lattices are only stable for tens of minutes at 22 °C ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . To achieve long - term stabilization we tested different crosslinking strategies . The use of glutaraldehyde as a non - speci ﬁ c crosslinker is widespread , and concentrations as low as 0 . 1 % are suf ﬁ cient to stabilize clathrin lattices in buffer for weeks . As an alternative stabilization strategy we successfully applied the photoactivatable 4 - azido - 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 - tetraoroenzo acid succi - nimidyl ester ( ATFB ) to covalently link clathrin to H 6 - epsin 144 - 575 ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . To further extend the lifetime , the protein network can be stabilized using uranyl acetate , which enables lattice dehydration . Biological activity can be restored by rehydrating the lattice using acetate - free buffer . We imaged the different steps by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to assess the structure of the lattice . Figure 3b , c show that the lattice remains intact after dehy - dration . After rehydration the clathrin lattice is rendered active again , as indicated by recovery of the lattice height and by the follow - ing functionalization experiments . Thus , the combination of cross - linking and stabilization with uranyl acetate allows the storage of stabilized lattices for months . We expect that this method may also be suitable for restoring the functionality of other protein complexes after rehydration . The use of protein lattices as sensors or synthetic reactors requires their functionalization by speci ﬁ c binding of particles . The clathrin lattice allows , in principle , a very regular and predict - able decoration . In the case of functional molecules , such as enzymes , the regular spacing could also optimize their activity by preventing too close packing . We ﬁ rst tested the attachment of col - loidal metal particles . The binding of gold particles to clathrin cages and hubs has already been demonstrated 20 , 21 , so we coupled gold nanoparticles to CLC in a comparable approach .

All rights reserved CHC , a regular decoration pattern with gold particles was obtained ( Fig . 4a ) . In contrast , the addition of gold light chains to a lattice that consisted of both CHC and native CLC showed very little incorpor - ation of gold particles ( Fig . 4b ) . This demonstrates the speci ﬁ c binding of the modi ﬁ ed CLC to the vacant CHC and also indicates a low dissociation rate of endogenous CLC . Because the coupling of CLC to gold is non - speci ﬁ c , there is limited control over the number of CLC bound to a single particle . We investigated whether the CLC per particle ratio in ﬂ uences the lattice decoration density ( Fig . 4c ) . At an approximate ratio of three CLC per particle , the lattice shows 1 , 525 particles per μm 2 , corresponding to 0 . 4 particles per lattice rib . Under the assumption that in a two - dimensional lattice , maximally two CLC can bind per rib 19 , 22 , this yields a decora - tion ef ﬁ ciency of at least 20 % . At higher CLC per particle ratios , the decoration density dropped , suggesting that multiple CHC in the lattice are bridged by single gold particles . The coordination of gold nanoparticles to CHC remains possible at a comparable dec - oration density after the earlier described stabilization with uranyl acetate and subsequent rehydration ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . A speci ﬁ c linker was next used to connect only one molecule per CLC to decorate the lattice with functional biological molecules . Auxilin is a coenzyme that binds clathrin , and with its J - domain recruits and activates the chaperone Hsc70 . In the presence of adeno - sine triphosphate ( ATP ) , Hsc70 is responsible for the natural enzy - matic disassembly reaction of clathrin networks . The J - domain of auxilin was fused with a GST - tag ( GST - auxilin 813 - 910 ) . This construct was coupled via hetero - dimerization with a GST - tagged CLC 23 ( Fig . 5a ) . Because Hsc70 , together with the J - domain , disassembles clathrin networks , enzyme activity can be followed by the disinte - gration of the lattice . A functional lattice was thus effectively designed that can be triggered to self - destruct upon the addition of Hsc70 and ATP ( Fig . 5b ) . To test if the ef ﬁ ciency depends on the decoration density , functionalized clathrin triskelia ( CHC carrying J - domain – CLC ) were mixed with native triskelia in different ratios ( 33 , 50 and 100 % J - domains – CHC ) to form a lattice . The enzymatic activity was obtained by quantifying the lattice quality by Fourier transform - ation of the images 16 . The intact lattices show a clear peak at 0 . 035 nm – 1 ( 30 nm periodicity of the hexagons ; Fig . 5c , inset ) , which was much less pronounced after disassembly . Figure 5c shows a clear correlation between the J - domain density and lattice degradation . Intriguingly , the functionalized lattice , with 100 % J - domain – CLC , shows a disassembly ef ﬁ ciency that is comparable , or even slightly higher , than the ef ﬁ ciency achieved in the control experiment with native CLC and an excess of full auxilin added to the solution . These experiments show that the lattice can be functio - nalized in a simple and effective way , either with inorganic particles or with enzymes that retain their activity . To gain better control over the synthetic activity of the functionalized lattices , further research will be aimed at optimizing the binding ef ﬁ ciency and measuring the activity and lifetime of the bound biomolecules . In conclusion , we have demonstrated the application of the natural protein clathrin and its subunits to assemble large and 1 , 600 1 , 400 1 , 200 1 , 000 800 600 P a r t i c l e s p e r µ m 2 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 CLC per particle a b c CHClattice Fulllattice Figure 4 | Lattice functionalization with nanoparticles . a , CHC lattices , which were ﬁ xed and supplemented with recombinant CLC coupled to colloidal gold particles in a ratio of 23 : 1 , show a regular pattern of gold particles . b , Lattices with endogenous CLC ( ‘ Full lattice ’ ) show only very little gold incorporation .

Coating of planar surfaces with H 6 - epsin 144 - 575 and clathrin . As substrates we used carbon - coated Formvar on copper grids ( Science Services , hereon termed ‘ grids ’ ; see also ref . 16 ) , highlyordered pyrolytic graphite ( HOPG , μmasch ) , standard aluminium foil , polyvinylformal ( PVF , Formvar ; Agar Scienti ﬁ c ) and glass ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) . Directly before coating , the surfaces were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge using an air pressure of 13 Pa and a current of 13 mA ( Leybold - Hereaus Combitron CM30 with a Balzers BSV 080 Evaporation control unit ) . H 6 - epsin 144 - 575 was attached by placing the substrates on top of a 20 μl droplet with 0 . 83 μM H 6 - epsin 144 - 575 in buffer G ( 25 mM HEPES , 125 mM potassium acetate , 5 mM magnesium acetate , pH 7 . 2 ) for 30 min at room temperature . Unbound protein was removed by transferring the grid sequentially to two 20 μl droplets of buffer G . Afterwards , the grid was transferred to a 20 μl droplet containing 0 . 08 μM clathrin and 1 mg ml – 1 BSA and was incubated for 30 min at room temperature . After removing unbound clathrin by transferring the surfaces twice to a 20 μl droplet of buffer G , the samples were ready to be further processed or to be ﬁ xed with glutaraldehyde ( Polyscience ) for microscopy . Microscopy . Routinely , clathrin lattices were inspected by negative stain electron microscopy ( EM ) . The lattices on grids were ﬁ rst ﬁ xed for 10 min with 3 % glutaraldehyde and stained with 5 % uranyl acetate . Clathrin assemblies on glass and aluminium were visualized after critical point drying and Pt / C - shadowing as described elsewhere 28 . The specimens were examined with a Tecnai G2 ( FEI ) electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV or with a Morgagni ( FEI ) electron microscope at 80 kV . Digital images were generated with TIA - Software ( FEI ) , processed with the program NIH ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop CS . X . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was used to inspect the clathrin lattices formed on the conductive graphene surfaces and to measure the heights of the lattices . The clathrin lattices were ﬁ xed for 20 min using 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde . The lattices were then imaged with a ‘ Cervantes Full Mode AFM System ’ ( Nanotec ) using AC40TS cantilevers ( f 0 = 110 kHz , k = 0 . 1 N m – 1 , Olympus ) in liquid and OMCL - AC240TS cantilevers ( f 0 = 70 kHz , k = 1 . 7 N m – 1 , Olympus ) in air . Calibration of the cantilevers was accomplished using the thermal noise spectrum 29 . The mode used to scan the lattices was ‘ jumping mode plus ’ 30 ( 100 nm jump off , 50 sample points ) , which allowed scanning at controlled vertical forces between 0 . 2 nN and several nanonewtons . Scan areas were 1 ×1 μm with 256 ×256 points . The height measurements of the lattice were performed as described in ref . 16 . For the imaging of single triskelia ( Fig . 1a ) , the triskelia were diluted to 0 . 04 mg ml – 1 in buffer G and immobilized on a piece of freshly cleaved mica . An AC40TS cantilever was used in amplitude modulation ( oscillation amplitude , 3 nm ; scan area , 250×250 nm 2 ; 128 ×128 points ) . Disassembly of clathrin lattices with NaSCN . Clathrin lattices assembled on grids as described above were transferred to a 20 μl droplet of NaSCN at the indicated concentration . For reversible disordering of the lattice , the grids were incubated with 0 . 05 M NaSCN and the incubation was strictly timed to 5 s . For lattice recovery , the grids were quickly transferred to two 20 μl droplets of buffer G and brie ﬂ y ( 60 s ) incubated on a third droplet of buffer G before ﬁ xation with glutaraldehyde . Incubations with higher concentrations of NaSCN or for longer times led to irreversible disruption of the lattice . For complete removal of clathrin , the grids were incubated with 1 M NaSCN for 5 min . To recoat the surfaces with clathrin , the grids were extensively rinsed by sequentially transferring them to three 40 μl droplets of buffer G . After NaSCN removal , the grids were transferred to a 20 μl droplet containing 0 . 08 μM clathrin and 1 mg ml – 1 BSA . Finally , the samples were prepared for EM . Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) . Alexa Fluor 488 - and Cy3 - labelled CLCs were puri ﬁ ed , ﬂ uorochromated and reconstituted with CHCs as detailed elsewhere 18 . The thus labelled Alexa Fluor 488 - and Cy3 - triskelia were mixed with unlabelled triskelia at an equal molar ratio to a ﬁ nal concentration of 0 . 08 μM . Glass coverslips and Formvar grids were coated with a thin carbon ﬁ lm , charged via glow discharge and coated with H 6 - epsin 144 - 575 as described before . The glass coverslips and the grids were placed side by side on the same 20 μl droplets containing the clathrin to ensure similar conditions for lattice assembly . After treatment with NaSCN , the lattices were ﬁ xed with 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde and 4 % paraformaldehyde before FRET measurements . After negative staining of the grids , proper clathrin lattice formation was ascertained by EM . FRET measurements and analysis were performed at 22 °C using a Leica Upright DM - R Confocal Microscope , a ×63 / 1 . 4 oil objective and the Leica FRET analysis software tool . Light - activated crosslinking of clathrin and H 6 - epsin 144 - 575 using ATFB . Freshly charged carbon - and Formvar - coated grids were incubated with 0 . 83 μM H 6 - epsin 144 - 575 in buffer G for 30 min . Unbound protein was removed by transferring the grids sequentially to two 20 μl droplets of buffer G . The grids were incubated on a 20 μl droplet phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) with 1 mg ml – 1 ATFB ( 4 - azido - 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 - tetraoroenzo acid succinimidyl ester , Sigma ) for 45 min at 23 °C in the dark . ATFB was dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide ( DMSO ) at 25 mg ml – 1 and stored at − 20 °C . Excess ATFB was removed by transferring the grids to three 20 μl droplets of buffer G . The grid was transferred to a 20 μl droplet containing 0 . 08 μM clathrin and 1 mg ml – 1 BSA and incubated for 30 min at room temperature . The grids , still covered with this droplet , were exposed to 50 mJ cm – 2 ultraviolet light ( λ = 312 nm ) at room temperature . The processed grids were exposed to NaSCN as indicated . Stabilization and rehydration of the lattice . After ﬁ xating the lattices with 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde ( in buffer G ) , the samples were rinsed , ﬁ rst with buffer G , and subsequently with buffer A ( 100 mM MES , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , pH 6 . 4 ) . The buffer was aspirated and the lattices were incubated for 1 min with 5 % uranyl acetate ( Polysciences ) in H 2 O . Excess staining solution was carefully removed with moist ﬁ lter paper and the samples were dried under a ﬂ ow of nitrogen . To rehydrate the lattices , the samples were placed sequentially on top of two drops of buffer A for 2 min and ﬁ xed again with 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde ( in buffer A ) . Finally , the sample was washed twice with buffer A . To rehydrate the lattice for functionalization , an extended incubation ( 15 min ) in buffer A was necessary to ensure complete removal of uranyl acetate . The subsequent ﬁ xation step was skipped . Lattice functionalization with gold particles . To conjugate colloidal gold to CLC , his - tagged light chains b ( H 6 - CLCb ) atfour different concentrations ( 0 . 24 , 0 . 59 , 1 . 78 and 3 . 28 μM ) were incubated with 0 . 078 μM gold particles ( 5 nm , BBI - solutions ) in 55 μl PBS for 5 min on ice . Subsequently , the particles were diluted with 945 μl PBS plus 2 mg ml – 1 BSA and pelleted at 90 , 720 g in an Optima TL100 ultracentrifuge ( Beckman Coulter ) for 15 min at 4 °C to remove unbound CLCs . The centrifugation step was repeated once more . Finally , the pellet was resuspended in 60 μl PBS with 1 mg ml – 1 BSA . To functionalize the lattices with gold particles , freshly charged grids were sequentially coated with 0 . 83 μM H 6 - epsin 144 - 575 in buffer G and 0 . 016 μM CHC . Unbound CHC was removed and the proteins were ﬁ xed with 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde for 10 min in buffer G . Unreacted aldehyde was quenched with 10 mM NH 4 SO 4 in buffer G containing 0 . 1 % BSA . The grids were washed by sequentially transferring them to two droplets of buffer G . Next , they were placed on a 15 μl droplet of His - tagged light chains b ( H 6 - CLCb ) coupled to 5 nm gold nanoparticles at different densities in buffer G with 10 mM NH 4 SO 4 and 1 mg ml – 1 BSA . After 30 min incubation at room temperature and sequential transfer over two droplets of buffer G , the grids were ﬁ xed as described for EM . To quantify the particle density on the lattice , for each concentration , 14 – 19 areas of 200×200 nm 2 were selected from different EM micrographs and the particles counted . The values in Fig . 4c show the mean and the standard error of the mean of these counts . To obtain the average binding per lattice rib we ﬁ rst estimated a lattice density of 1 , 283 hexagons per μm 2 ( assuming 30 nm between parallel ribs ) . Considering that each hexagon has six ribs and each rib is shared by two hexagons , this results in 3 , 849 ribs per μm² . This represents an upper estimate , as it does not take into account eventual defects in the lattice 16 . Lattice functionalization with auxilin J - domain . To conjugate the auxilin J - domain to CLC the following procedure was followed . The expression and puri ﬁ cation of recombinant H 6 - CLCb was performed as described 24 for H 6 - Δ ANTH - AP180 328 - 896 . GST - CLC and GST - auxilin 813 - 910 were expressed and puri ﬁ ed as described elsewhere 18 , 23 , 31 . GST - CLC / GST - auxilin 813 - 910 heterodimers were obtained by dissociating the respective homodimers with 1 . 25 M guanidinium hydrochloride ( GndHCl ) , 42 mM sodium phosphate , 2 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 2 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 0 , into monomers 23 , 31 . A two - molar excess of GST - auxilin 813 - 910 was added to the GST - CLC monomers and the GndHCl was exchanged for PBS and 1 mM DTT on a PD10 desalting column . GST - CLC / GST - auxilin 813 - 910 heterodimers were enriched by gel ﬁ ltration through a Superdex 200 column ( GE Life Science ) equilibrated in PBS . Hsc70 was puri ﬁ ed from pig brain essentially as described elsewhere 32 . Clathrin triskelia in the cartoon in Fig . 5a were designed and assembled using the 3D CAD System Inventor Professional 2013 from Autodesk , as described elsewhere 16 .

All rights reserved Grids coated with CHC lattices and recombined GST - auxilin 813 - 910 coupled to GST - light chains were transferred to a 15 μl droplet of buffer G containing 1 μM Hsc70 , 2 mM ATP , 5 mM creatine phosphate , 5 u ml – 1 creatine phosphokinase . The samples were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C . BSA ( 1 mg ml – 1 ) was included at all incubation stages . The reaction was terminated by placing the grid onto a droplet of 3 % glutaraldehyde in buffer G . To quantify the ef ﬁ ciency of lattice disassembly by auxilin or the J - domain and Hsc70 , electron micrographs , obtained with identical instrument settings and comparable contrast were converted to the spatial frequency space by fast Fourier transformation ( FFT ) . The one - dimensional radial average of each two - dimensional FFT was used to ﬁ t a Lorentzian function to the peak at 0 . 035 l nm – 1 , to obtain its height with respect to the noise background . The relative quality of the lattice was de ﬁ ned by the ratio of the peak heights after and before the disassembly reaction . References 24 .
