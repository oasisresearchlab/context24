Using quarterly product - level data on the major mobile handset manufacturers for the period 2004 – 2009 , we analyze how product - level feedback affects product phaseout and how these decisions are conditioned by organizational structure—the extent to which decision making is centralized . We argue that such structure affects termi - nation in two ways : directly , through coordination , and indirectly , by shaping the interpretation of performance feedback . Our baseline models indicate that as performance increases above aspirations , the rate of phaseout decreases . We ﬁnd that as performance declines below aspirations , the rate of phaseout decreases , but then increases when the product falls below a certain sales threshold . We also ﬁnd evidence that centralization ampliﬁes the feedback effect above aspirations but attenuates it below aspirations . This study links two pillars of the Carnegie school , aspiration levels and hierarchy , to explain the complexity of phaseout following perceived success or failure . We thereby augment the growing scholarship on performance feedback by considering some important conditional effects imposed by a centralized structure . Our focus on centralization expands the scope of theory concerning organization design by linking structure and cognition to explain ﬁrm behavior , especially termination decisions .

Introduction This study examines the effects of organizational struc - ture and performance feedback on product phaseout . Product phaseout is part of a broader category of ter - mination decisions that includes decisions to dissolve organizational units ( Mitchell 1994 ) , halt investments ( McGrath and Nerkar 2004 , Guler 2007 ) , abandon prac - tices ( Greve 1998 , Gaba and Dokko 2015 ) , sell off units ( Hayward and Shimizu 2006 , Karim 2006 , Desai 2016 , Vidal and Mitchell 2015 ) , end alliances ( Heimeriks et al . 2015 ) , and exit technologies ( Eggers 2012 ) . Termina - tion decisions are an important aspect of ﬁrm evolu - tion ; they bear on a ﬁrm’s competencies and survival ( Schoonhoven et al . 1990 ) . Product termination ﬁg - ures prominently in high - tech industries , where ﬁrms must respond to changing markets by actively manag - ing their product portfolios ( Henderson and Stern 2004 , de Figueiredo and Kyle 2006 ) . Although the mecha - nisms driving new product introductions have been stud - ied widely ( see Brown and Eisenhardt 1995 ) , much less is known about the drivers of product phaseout . The problem with product phaseout , and termination decisions more generally , is that managers are boundedly rational ( Simon 1955 ) and , when deciding whether to terminate or retain activities , rely on noisy performance signals ( Benner and Tripsas 2012 , Posen and Levinthal 2012 ) . These decisions can thus be affected by percep - tions of product success or failure , which suggests the behavioral theory of the ﬁrm as a suitable lens through which to view such decisions ( Cyert and March 1963 , Greve 2003 , Bromiley 2005 ) . Behavioral theories of per - formance feedback demonstrate that organizations per - sist with successful activities ( Audia et al . 2000 ) but change their activities following perceived failure ( Baum and Dahlin 2007 ) . Although there is considerable sup - port for models of performance feedback ( see Shinkle 2012 ) , their explanatory potential for decisions—such as termination—is limited by assumptions concerning the interpretation of feedback information . In general , performance feedback studies draw their conclusions from the implicit assumption that feedback is invari - antly assessed regardless of the structures within which decisions are made . Largely absent from these accounts is the role played by formal organizational structure— whether decision making is centralized or decentralized . 1 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 195 . 72 . 238 ] on 02 S e p t e m b e r 2016 , a t 07 : 22 .

Joseph , Klingebiel , and Wilson : Organizational Structure and Performance Feedback 2 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS Yet organizational structure may have signiﬁcant im - plications for termination decisions within large vertical hierarchies because it inﬂuences both the nature of infor - mation processing and the assessment of performance feedback . Structure’s role in information processing is a well established one in that it can facilitate the efﬁcient collection , processing , and distribution of information intended to help managers make decisions ( Galbraith 1974 , 1977 ; Tushman and Nadler 1978 ) . Concerns about information processing have remained central to management research , with particular attention given to the coordination ( Burton and Obel 2004 , Puranam et al . 2012 ) and screening properties ( Csaszar 2012 , Christensen and Knudsen 2010 ) of different organiza - tional structures . Less known is how organizational structure affects responsiveness to performance feedback . A few stud - ies have examined how different subunits within a ﬁrm may have distinct reactions to their respective feedback . ( Audia and Sorenson 2001 , Vissa et al . 2010 , Gaba and Joseph 2013 , Sengul and Obloj 2014 ) . Audia and Soren - son ( 2001 ) examined the outcomes that follow from dif - ferent subunits’ feedback . Similarly , Gaba and Joseph ( 2013 ) focused on the unique responses that follow from vertically differentiated corporate and divisional feed - back . However , these studies focused on how subunits respond to their respective feedback ; thus , they left open the question of how the exact same feedback is processed by different organizational structures . That question is the subject of our analysis . In this study , we examine the effect of structure on ter - mination by concentrating on centralization versus decen - tralization of decision making—whether or not decisions must be elevated to higher levels within the hierarchy . Our main thesis is that structure affects termination in two ways : directly , through vertical information ﬂow , and indirectly , through performance assessment . We argue that ﬁrm responses to success and failure—speciﬁcally , to performance above and below aspirations—may differ as a function of the extent of ( de ) centralization because of corresponding differences in problem - solving processes . According to the attention - based perspective , organiza - tional structure segments attention and shapes the cog - nitive strategies through which problems and solutions are identiﬁed ( Ocasio 1997 ) . Organizational structure may thus condition problemistic search behavior and responses to feedback . We test our predictions using a data set of product sales in the German mobile device industry for 2004 – 2009 , a period that was part of the “feature phone era . ” Our main effects models indicate that as perfor - mance increases above aspirations , the rate of phase - out decreases . We ﬁnd that as performance declines below aspirations , the rate of phaseout decreases but then increases when the product falls below a certain sales threshold . We also ﬁnd that centralization ampli - ﬁes the feedback effect above aspirations but attenuates it below aspirations . This study makes three contributions to the literature . First , we apply a new theoretical lens to the important issue of termination decisions . We address the role of performance feedback , given that termination decisions may be especially challenging owing to the uncertainty involved . Organizational structure has also been over - looked in prior studies of termination decisions , in spite of the empirical regularity with which many such deci - sions occur in complex organizations . Second , we aug - ment theories of performance feedback by elaborating the conditioning role of organizational structure . Despite its obvious importance , the structure within which a decision is made is a contextual feature that remains largely unexplored in the performance feedback liter - ature . This paper seeks to reduce that gap by linking theories of attention ( Ocasio 1997 , Ocasio 2011 ) and performance feedback ( Bromiley 2005 , Greve 2003 ) to provide a structure – feedback model of ﬁrm behavior in the context of termination decisions . More generally , our ﬁndings offer new insights into how structural and attentional drivers interact to shape adaptive behavior , of which phaseout is but one example . Little is known about this aspect of organizational design , so explo - rations along these lines answer the call of scholars to understand the cognitive implications of different structural arrangements and reintegrate organizational structure into the behavioral foundations of the Carnegie tradition ( Gavetti et al . 2007 ) . Performance Feedback and Termination Decisions Performance feedback theory is based on the premise that decision makers rely on feedback when identifying the problems to which they should attend . In models of performance feedback , boundedly rational decision mak - ers simplify performance evaluations by transforming a continuous measure of performance into a discrete mea - sure of success or failure ( Lant 1992 ) . To do so , decision makers compare their performance along an important dimension to an aspiration level , which serves as a divid - ing line between perceived success ( gain ) and failure ( loss ) . Hence , decisions—such as termination—follow from comparisons that suggest product performance is either above or below that aspiration level . When product performance increases above the aspi - ration level , the product is likely to be retained by the organization . Managers tend to persist with actions pre - viously associated with favorable outcomes ( Audia et al . 2000 ) , because success creates conﬁdence in existing knowledge and biases decisions against changes ( Greve 1998 ) or novel alternatives ( Denrell and March 2001 , Posen and Levinthal 2012 ) . Moreover , product success D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 195 . 72 . 238 ] on 02 S e p t e m b e r 2016 , a t 07 : 22 . F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . Joseph , Klingebiel , and Wilson : Organizational Structure and Performance Feedback Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS 3 serves to reinforce that the ﬁrm’s strategies , technolo - gies , and processes supporting the product are effective in their current form and will lead to the retention of those activities that have contributed to the product’s success ( Grohsjean et al . 2012 ) . As a result , managers are more likely to keep products on the market longer . That product termination decreases as performance falls below the aspiration level reﬂects the idea that fail - ure triggers problemistic search : “search that is stim - ulated by a problem … and is directed toward ﬁnding a solution to that problem” ( Cyert and March 1963 , p . 121 ) . The ﬁrm’s speciﬁc problem - solving approach will depend on how far product performance falls below the aspiration level . Such is the prediction of behavioral theories that posit that managers utilize multiple refer - ence points in decision making ( Blettner et al . 2014 ) . In particular , March and Shapira ( 1992 ) offer a shifting focus model , which assumes that managers may focus on either an aspiration or on survival , depending on the performance shortfall’s severity . The basis for this model is their observation that managers see aspirations and survival as distinct from each other and that sufﬁcient decreases in performance may be interpreted as a step closer to the depletion of solutions ( Forlani 2002 , Boyle and Shapira 2012 ) . Under such conditions , managerial attention shifts to a survival threshold and away from the aspiration level , and corresponding actions are redi - rected to efforts to avoid the “threat” of complete failure ( Staw et al . 1981 ) . In the context of this study , the shifting focus model would predict that as product performance falls be - low aspiration levels , managers will continue to invest in existing products and culling will slow , but as the performance - aspiration gap gets sufﬁciently large , culling will accelerate . This implies a U - shaped relation - ship between performance below aspirations and rate of phaseout . Small performance shortfalls will be viewed as reparable discrepancies ( Lehman et al . 2011 ) , and solu - tions will be sought in the proximity of problem symp - toms ( Cyert and March 1963 ) . Hence , managers will become more willing to leave the ( failing ) product on the market longer and to risk resources to bolster sales of the product ( Bromiley and Wiseman 1989 ) . However , when product performance falls far enough below the aspi - ration level , attention shifts away from aspirations , and managers may become concerned with the exhaustion of solutions to save the product ( March and Simon 1958 ) . They may become increasingly concerned with devoting limited resources to a failure ( Kacperczyk et al . 2015 ) and with making highly visible errors such as failure to cull clearly inferior products ( Shapira 1993 ) . As a result , the rate of phaseout then increases . In all , these consid - erations lead us to propose the following hypotheses . Hypothesis 1A ( H1A ) . As the performance – aspira - tion gap ( above aspirations ) increases , the rate of prod - uct phaseout decreases . Hypothesis 1B ( H1B ) . As the performance – aspira - tion gap ( below aspirations ) increases , the rate of product phaseout ﬁrst decreases and then increases ( is U - shaped ) . Organizational Structure and Termination Decisions A long tradition of research recognizes that organi - zational design plays a key part in orchestrating the overall decision - making process within ﬁrms and , as a consequence , the outcomes that follow ( Burton and Obel 2004 , Gulati et al . 2012 ) . The design of an organiza - tion’s structure reﬂects “the pattern of communications and relations among a group of human beings , includ - ing the processes for making and implementing deci - sions” ( Simon 1947 , pp . 18 – 19 ) . Organizational research that addresses the decision - making implications of orga - nizational structure has traditionally been anchored by information processing theory : the study of how struc - tural choices bear directly on the ﬁrm’s capacity to col - lect , process , and distribute such information as plans , budgets , market conditions , and feedback ( Tushman and Nadler 1978 , p . 614 ; see also Galbraith 1974 , 1977 ) . One of the critical design choices bearing on infor - mation processing is that of centralization versus decentralization of decision making ( Egelhoff 1988 ) . Centralization reﬂects the extent to which the locus of authority to make ﬁnal decisions affecting the organi - zation is concentrated at higher levels of the hierar - chy ( Child 1972 ) . As a structural property of the ﬁrm , centralization reﬂects a variety of standard operating procedures , formal roles , communication channels , and informal interactions that emphasize vertical information ﬂow ( Galbraith 1974 ) . Centralization and Information Processing The information processing implications of centralized structures suggest that , ceteris paribus , products will be culled more quickly . Because centralized structures emphasize vertical information ﬂow ( Egelhoff 1988 , pp . 131 – 132 ) and communication channels that ele - vate decisions within the corporate hierarchy ( Galbraith 1977 ) , they may ( 1 ) circumvent time - consuming politi - cal behavior ( Baum and Wally 2003 ) and ( 2 ) ease coor - dination problems that would otherwise delay phaseout ( Galbraith 1977 ) . Product phaseout involves adjusting a range of activ - ities such as operator road maps , factory schedules , and supply chains , which creates interdependencies with respect to the phaseout process . The presence of inter - dependencies creates the need for communication and agreement across functions and product managers . How - ever , the requirement for agreement in the context of portfolio management may delay decision making owing to the diverse and often conﬂicting demands that must D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 195 . 72 . 238 ] on 02 S e p t e m b e r 2016 , a t 07 : 22 .

Joseph , Klingebiel , and Wilson : Organizational Structure and Performance Feedback 4 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS be served by any particular phaseout decision ( Cyert and March 1963 ) . For example , Nokia’s decentralized handset business was beset with a decision making envi - ronment of managers trying to reach agreement . Prod - uct management at Nokia was described as “stymied by too many people wanting a say in strategic deci - sions” ( Parker and Ward 2010 ) . Under such circum - stances , centralized structures may avoid what would be otherwise time - consuming negotiations to resolve dis - cordant preferences on which products to terminate ( and which products to launch as replacements ) . Senior man - agers have less need to devote excessive effort and time to documenting decisions or justifying thought processes ( Isenberg 1986 ) and can prevent delays stemming from conﬂict between product managers ( Baum and Wally 2003 ) . For example , under Sanjay Jha , Motorola cen - tralized product decisions and alleviated the internecine competition between product teams ( Hansell 2009 ) . Moreover , centralization’s emphasis on vertical infor - mation ﬂow may reduce delays owing to coordination problems ( Khandwalla 1973 ) , following termination decisions . An emphasis on vertical communication may limit the potentially dense lateral communication ﬂows that would be otherwise required to coordinate among phaseout activities ( Galbraith 1977 ) . Executives within a centralized organization have access to information on the complete spectrum of products , which helps them avoid coordination failures and delays associated with poor synchronization of activities ( Puranam et al . 2012 ) . This is consistent with research that shows mod - ularization in certain decision - making environments is costly ( Birkinshaw et al . 2002 ) and may sacriﬁce speed and efﬁciency for other outcomes ( Eisenhardt 1989 ) . Although centralized structures have the potential to bur - den top managers with decision overload , we argue here , as others ( Rivkin and Siggelkow 2003 ) have , that these factors are outweighed by political and coordination fac - tors . We therefore offer the following : Hypothesis 2 ( H2 ) . Greater centralization of deci - sion making increases the rate of product phaseout . Centralization and Performance Feedback Information processing is only one mechanism through which organization structure may affect termination decisions . Organizational structure also governs the attention focus of managers and , correspondingly , their assessment of performance and response to feedback . The idea that structure shapes attention serves as the foundation for the attention - based view of the ﬁrm ( Ocasio 1997 , Ocasio and Joseph 2005 , Bouquet and Birkinshaw 2008 , Rerup 2009 ) , and it provides a means to understand why responses to performance feedback may vary with the degree of centralization . From an attention - based perspective , the role of organizational structure in adaptation is to shape the noticing , inter - preting , and focusing of time and effort by organi - zational decision makers on problems and solutions ( Ocasio 1997 , p . 189 ) . Within complex organizations , the distribution of attention is not uniform , and the rele - vance of particular elements of the internal and external environment varies according to the structural position of decision makers ( Gaba and Joseph 2013 ) . Here we posit that centralization conditions the effects of per - formance feedback on termination decisions . In partic - ular , we argue that the degree of centralization affects how feedback is interpreted and how responses to per - formance problems are chosen and enacted . In decentralized decision - making structures , individ - ual product sales are attended to closely by ( lower - level ) product managers , who are guided by rules , incentives , and cognitive frames oriented toward meeting unit per - formance targets . Their identities , interests , and careers are tied more closely to speciﬁc products , and hence these managers are likely to focus on the life - cycle management of those products . Moreover , the perfor - mance of any one product is likely to accord with team performance evaluations , in which case perfor - mance assessment becomes as much a team evaluation as a product performance evaluation ( March and Simon 1958 ) . Product performance that falls below aspirations directs attention to the problem product and may reﬂect negatively on the product team . When phaseout deci - sions remain low in the hierarchy , this outcome will acti - vate efforts to address the performance problem and to preserve the team’s positive image ( Jordan and Audia 2012 ) . Even as product performance declines , deci - sion makers within decentralized structures are likely to exhibit upward bias in their beliefs about the viability of their products—a bias that might cause retention of those products ( Audia and Brion 2007 ) . Within a centralized structure , in contrast , product evaluations are elevated to higher levels in the ﬁrm . Retention – termination decisions are vested with more senior - level managers , who focus their attention on the ﬁrm’s entirety of products and not just one or two of them . For centralized decision makers , the performance of any one product is less critical to assessments of their own performance . When a product’s performance de - clines , belief in the attractiveness of other products may be relatively more favorable . As a result , they will be more willing to cull products when performance is poor . Because the subsequent problemistic search processes are typically restricted to familiar and proximate areas ( March and Simon 1958 ) , the choice of solutions will also be affected by organizational hierarchy . In other words , what constitutes a “local” solution will vary with the ﬁrm’s locus of decision making . In a decentralized structure , lower - level managers are likely to focus on tactical solutions for particular products , such as making D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 195 . 72 . 238 ] on 02 S e p t e m b e r 2016 , a t 07 : 22 .

Joseph , Klingebiel , and Wilson : Organizational Structure and Performance Feedback Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS 5 changes to the marketing strategy . In a centralized struc - ture , problem solving is not circumscribed by product boundaries and is likely to reﬂect centralized decision makers’ focus on and experience with resource alloca - tion across an entire portfolio of products . Here , solu - tions will be broader in nature ( Siggelkow and Rivkin 2005 ) , and most consequentially for phaseout , prob - lems will be addressed by redirecting resources from unsuccessful to successful products . The centralized ﬁrm accomplishes this task by increasing the former’s rate of withdrawal and decreasing the latter’s rate of with - drawal . Over time , centralized organizations develop mental models , rules , and routines that reinforce this pat - tern of retaining high performers and withdrawing low performers ( Rerup and Feldman 2011 ) . For example , centralized ﬁrms may create planning and budgeting rou - tines that automatically cut discretionary spending and promotional activities for products that do not perform well ( Vancil 1978 ) , effectively shortening their life . In sum , the greater the elevation of decision - making authority within the ﬁrm , the greater the overall focus will be on changes to activities that have signiﬁcance for maintaining the whole enterprise and for ensuring the portfolio’s survival—even at the expense of a par - ticular product . The differences in problemistic search as performed by centralized / decentralized structures sug - gest our next two hypotheses . Hypothesis 3A ( H3A ) . When performance increases above aspirations , centralization ampliﬁes the effects of performance feedback on phaseout ( decreases rate of phaseout ) . Hypothesis 3B ( H3B ) . When performance decreases below aspirations , centralization attenuates the effects of performance feedback on phaseout ( increases rate of phaseout ) . Methods Our data sample covers all German - market mobile phones introduced after January 2004 and terminated before December 2009 by the ﬁve largest ﬁrms . These companies—LG Electronics , Motorola , Nokia , Samsung Electronics , and Sony Ericsson—accounted for nearly two - thirds of all mobile phones launched in the German market during the time period of our study . An advan - tage to conﬁning our analysis to a single industry and country setting—and to Germany , in particular—allows us to trace precisely which products have been culled and also eliminates concerns arising from aggregate per - formance measures that disguise heterogeneity across countries . As conﬁrmed by our interviews and an analy - sis of culling patterns , product phaseout decisions were country - speciﬁc decisions , and as Germany is the largest and most advanced European market for devices , we can trace phaseout decisions in this country with conﬁ - dence . Our mobile phone data come from the GfK retail panel , regarded as the industry benchmark because it gathers retail sales ﬁgures at the points of sale and not from manufacturer surveys . Moreover , GfK , is based in Germany , and its data quality is strongest in its home market . To ensure robustness , we cross - checked the GfK data set with data from competing providers ( Klingebiel and Joseph 2016 ) . The mobile phone industry is charac - terized by high rates of new product introductions and technological advances and short product life ( 4 . 3 quar - ters ) , which ensures that our data capture multiple gen - erations of manufacturers’ product portfolios . Also , the organizational charts of our sample ﬁrms are roughly similar . In each major ﬁrm , there is a mobile unit head as well as several layers between that head and the product managers . However , some ﬁrms decentralize decisions , whereas other ﬁrms centralize . Our sample consists only of a few large ﬁrms , but the degree of these ﬁrms’ cen - tralization varies over time and thereby enables our rely - ing on within - ﬁrm variation to identify the hypothesized effects . Data were analyzed by quarter ; the result was a total of 3 , 192 product - quarter observations comprising 461 product exits across 546 devices within the sample . Financial data are from Compustat and quarterly reports . Descriptive statistics and correlations for all variables are in Table 1 . Dependent Variable The key event for our analysis is phaseout of a product from the German market . A mobile phone qualiﬁes as a distinct product if at least one of its design charac - teristics differs from those of the ﬁrm’s previous prod - ucts . The precise date of product phaseout is difﬁcult to establish because such dates are seldom known outside the company ( de Figueiredo and Kyle 2006 ) . Mobile phone phaseouts are also complicated by retail distribu - tion channels , which purchase handsets from the manu - facturers before selling them to end users . We therefore deﬁne phaseout as the cessation of product shipments from the handset manufacturer to German retailers , not as the cessation of all retail sales . The data give an indi - cation of manufacturers’ phaseout decisions in the form of a discontinuous fall in monthly sales in Germany , as the manufacturer does not itself give an exact discontin - uation date . All device phaseouts were coded manually by two individuals . Interrater agreement was high : for 94 % of the devices , the coded phaseout dates were within three months of each other . For those devices whose coded phaseout dates were not within three months , the coders jointly revisited the available information and reached a consensus on the phaseout date . Devices already on the market at the beginning of our observation period ( left - censored observations ) were not coded . For a subsample of devices , we were able to locate data through inter - nal documentation and found these data to be consistent with our manual coding .

Feedback consists of perfor - mance signals derived from one’s own past performance or the performance of peer ﬁrms ( Greve 1998 ) . These reference points have been classiﬁed by empirical stud - ies as , respectively , historical and social aspiration lev - els . We follow previous research in the context of a product portfolio and focus on historical aspirations ( Audia and Greve 2006 , Audia and Brion 2007 ) . 1 Our performance measure is based on quarterly sales at the device level because such sales represent a key perfor - mance indicator in the industry and are tracked closely by manufacturers , carriers , and analysts . We employ a formulation similar to those used in other studies on performance feedback ( Baum et al . 2005 ) . 2 We deﬁne a historical aspiration level for product per - formance as an exponentially weighted moving average of its past performance . Let HA it denote the historical aspirations of phone i at time t , and let P it denote the actual performance of phone i at time t . Then , historical aspiration is given by HA it = (cid:129) P it − 1 + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:129)(cid:53) HA it − 1 . In the historical aspiration formula , (cid:129) can be viewed as an adjustment parameter : a lower (cid:129) corresponds to giving greater weight to performance farther in the past as com - pared with the weight given to more recent performance . The value of (cid:129) was established by searching over all parameter values of (cid:129) in increments of 0 . 1 and then using the value that yielded the maximum log - likelihood ; this procedure is consistent with that used in previous studies ( Baum et al . 2005 , Moliterno and Wiersema 2007 ) . The outcome was (cid:129) = 0 (cid:48) 1 , although our ﬁndings are robust to the weighting scheme . The adjustment parameter so determined suggests that aspiration levels are updated slowly , a result found previously for large multinational ﬁrms ( Mezias et al . 2002 ) . The performance – aspiration gap was deﬁned as the difference between performance and aspiration level for each of the phones , or the quantity ( P it − HA it ) . We im - plemented a spline function to compare the effects of a performance – aspirations gap above zero ( P it > HA it ) and below zero ( P it < HA it ) . The technique consists of splitting the variable for historical performance relative to aspirations into two separate variables . Performance above aspirations is set equal to zero for all observations in which the performance ( at the phone level ) of the focal ﬁrm is less than its historical aspiration level ; when the phone’s performance is above that level , we use the difference between actual performance and the histori - cal aspirations level ( divided by 1 , 000 ) . Thus , ( Perfor - mance above historic aspirations ) it = max (cid:54) 0 (cid:49) P it − HA it (cid:55) , where i indicates a particular device and t a particu - lar quarter . Performance below historic aspiration is de - ﬁned symmetrically . In other words , it is set equal to zero when performance is above the aspirations level and equals the performance – aspirations gap when per - formance falls below that level : ( Performance below historic aspirations ) it = (cid:151) min (cid:54) P it − HA it (cid:49) 0 (cid:55) (cid:151) .

All performance feedback variables are lagged by three quarters in the empirical speciﬁcation . Three - quarter temporal separation between feedback and phaseout rec - ognizes that mean product life for mobile devices is relatively short and accommodates the ramp - down time required to coordinate all aspects of a product’s phase - out . This is consistent with internal product documenta - tion and evidence from our interviews . To model the survival level in this context , we adopt two approaches that have been used in the literature . The ﬁrst approach is to square the performance below aspirations variable and include it in the speciﬁcation ( Lehman et al . 2011 ) . The second approach is to use an indicator variable to model a discrete threshold for the survival level ( March and Shapira 1987 , 1992 ; Miller and Chen 2004 , Boyle and Shapira 2012 ) . Based on evi - dence from ﬁrm - provided internal documentation , we set our survival - level indicator equal to 1 when a device is in the lowest 20 % of sales for all devices in our sample . 3 Organizational Structure : Centralization and Oversight Because ﬁrms seldom make structural information publi - cally available , we use multiple sources to map intertem - poral changes in structure for the sample ﬁrms . We develop two measures intended to assess the nature of decision making in each ﬁrm . For the ﬁrst measure , we used both primary data ( manager interviews ) and sec - ondary data ( organization charts , books , news articles ) to assess the degree of ( de ) centralization in decision mak - ing in each ﬁrm ( similar to Henderson and Cockburn 1994 ) . For the second measure , we draw on the ﬁnan - cial economics literature ( e . g . , Shin and Stulz 1998 ) and utilize a measure that reﬂects the extent of corporate oversight of business unit decision making . Centralization . To create the ﬁrst measure , two sets of coders ( the authors and ﬁrm managers with exten - sive knowledge of product management ) rated , on a 5 - point Likert scale , the degree of centralization at each ﬁrm for each year of our sample . The authors developed their ratings of centralization by conducting an exten - sive literature search to build an initial understanding of each ﬁrm’s decision - making processes . The search cov - ered newspapers and magazines , several business case publishers , and books spanning a decade of discussion about our ﬁve focal companies . In total , we consulted more than 200 sources that addressed the product man - agement process , organizational structure , or organiza - tional change . This extensive review enabled us to build case narratives and facilitated our assessing the degree of centralization for each ﬁrm - year over the study period . Using data from the case narratives , we used the fol - lowing question to motivate our Likert - scale variable of centralization : What is the degree to which product port - folio decisions must be deferred to someone higher up in the organization for approval ( 1 for decisions never need to be approved at higher levels , 5 for every decision must be deferred to someone higher up in the organi - zation ) ? Prior studies of centralization ( e . g . , Bunderson 2003 ) document strong consistency across centralization measures constructed from multiple survey questions , which suggests that a single measure is sufﬁcient for an accurate assessment of the construct . An example of high centralization ( 5 ) is Samsung in 2006 . At the time , Ki Tae Lee was the head of the mobile device unit at Samsung and was seen as responsible for the initial successes in the department following a difﬁcult entry into the mobile device market ( Chang 2011 ) . A former Samsung product manager describes his role as follows : “During his period as a head of the mobile device busi - ness unit , he controlled everything , including design . ” Alternatively , Nokia exhibited a low degree of central - ization ( 2 ) in the early years of the sample . Proposals were often screened by interlocking management com - mittees , who evaluated projects using consensual rules for decision making ( O’Brien 2010 ) . We then conducted semistructured interviews with individuals in each ﬁrm knowledgeable about the prod - uct management process . In all cases , we utilized professional or alumni contacts from the authors’ insti - tutions to gain entry into the ﬁrms and , from that point , located three middle - to senior - level managers who were familiar with the intricacies of product management by virtue of playing that role themselves or of interact - ing extensively with the organization’s portfolio man - agement teams . The interviews were approximately an hour in length and transcribed ; they were held in per - son whenever possible . In total , we conducted interviews with 15 managers across the ﬁve ﬁrms . To ground our data in time , we focus on key facts and events ( e . g . , Eisenhardt 1989 ) ; these include the portfolio manage - ment process , the steps in assessing launch and phase - out possibilities , the organizational structure and locus of portfolio management decisions , and changes to the structure during our study period . Next , we created a formal survey and sent it to our primary senior interview subject from each ﬁrm . This survey incorporated the same initial question driving our own assessment and asked potential responders to evaluate structure for each ﬁrm - year starting in 2004 . For the Korean companies , we had the survey trans - lated into Korean and then translated back ( by another individual ) into English to ensure that our questions retained their original meaning . The respondents’ eval - uations were then compared with those of the authors .

Joseph , Klingebiel , and Wilson : Organizational Structure and Performance Feedback 8 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS The interrater agreement was 92 % , and there was only one ﬁrm for which respondents differed from our own analysis . In that case , we returned to our contacts for a better understanding of the organizational structure and to arrive at a measure that was in line with their own . Our structure variable exhibited substantial variation over time : the mean of our centralization variable was 3 . 15 , and it ranged from 2 to 5 . This range is consis - tent with ﬁrms attempting to reap the beneﬁts associ - ated with ﬂexibility and efﬁciency during a turbulent stage of industry development ( Siggelkow and Levinthal 2005 ) . For example , Bartlett and Ghoshal ( 1990 , p . 305 ) noted that Ericsson had created a “constant ebb and ﬂow in the centralization and decentralization of various responsibilities . ” Oversight . To ensure the reliability of our centraliza - tion measure , we used archival data to construct a second measure that examines the degree of corporate oversight of business unit decisions . For this measure , we con - sidered the extent to which resources were dispropor - tionately allocated by the corporate ofﬁce to the mobile device unit and , accordingly , the amount of attention paid by the corporate ofﬁce to their decisions . Link - age between corporate resource allocation and organiza - tional attention has been observed in different contexts ( Gilbert 2005 ) , and corporate allocations of resources have been found to predict managerial attention to par - ticular business units ( Bouquet and Birkinshaw 2008 , Gaba and Joseph 2013 ) . Building upon this foundation , we reason that a disproportionate over - or underinvest - ment in the mobile devices unit by the corporate ofﬁce would be accompanied by a concomitant degree of over - sight of business unit decisions , including those related to products . To construct our oversight measure , we ﬁrst calculated an estimate of what capital investment in the mobile devices unit should be in light of observed sales , cash ﬂow of the mobile unit ( and of other ﬁrm units ) , and the mobile unit’s external investment opportunities . This expected capital investment was calculated following the approach of Shin and Stulz ( 1998 ) , whereby we estimated I mobile (cid:49)j(cid:49)t V j(cid:49)t − 1 = a + b S mobile (cid:49)j(cid:49)t − 1 − S mobile (cid:49)j(cid:49)t − 2 S mobile (cid:49)j(cid:49)t − 2 + c C mobile (cid:49)j(cid:49)t V j(cid:49)t − 1 + d C other (cid:49)j(cid:49)t V j(cid:49)t − 1 + eq mobile (cid:49)j(cid:49)t − 1 + (cid:152) mobile (cid:49)j(cid:49)t (cid:49) where I mobile (cid:49)j(cid:49)t represents the ﬁrm’s investment in the mobile device segment of ﬁrm j during year t , which we measure as the change in total assets from time t − 1 to time t ; this measure was used because direct capital expenditures were not available at the segment level across all ﬁrm years . The term V j(cid:49)t is the book value of ﬁrm j ’s assets at the end of year t − 1 , and S mobile (cid:49)j(cid:49)t − 1 denotes sales of ﬁrm j ’s mobile device seg - ment during year t − 1 . The term C mobile (cid:49)j(cid:49)t represents the cash ﬂow of ﬁrm j ’s mobile device segment dur - ing year t , and C other (cid:49)j(cid:49)t represents the cash ﬂow of ﬁrm j ’s other segments ( i . e . , all those except for the mobile device segment ) during year t . We used operating proﬁt by segment as our proxy for cash ﬂow because detailed cash information was not available at the segment level . Finally , q mobile (cid:49)j(cid:49)t is Tobin’s Q for ﬁrm j ’s mobile device segment at the end of year t − 1 ; it represents investment opportunity in mobile devices . We calculated Tobin’s Q for mobile devices by using the ratio of ﬁrm market value to asset value exhibited by such nondiversiﬁed ﬁrms as Blackberry and Palm . We are interested in the degree to which more senior managers are disproportionately more or less involved in the decisions of the mobile device segment , so we constructed a residual measure using the predicted value of I mobile (cid:49)j(cid:49)t / V j(cid:49)t − 1 minus the actual observed investment in each year for each ﬁrm . A residual that deviates sig - niﬁcantly from zero is indicative of a ﬁrm’s abnormal ( high or low ) investment in the mobile phone business unit . A positive residual value suggests that the corporate ofﬁce has allocated extra capital to the mobile device segment and hence that decisions regarding the segment are more likely to require approval by senior manage - ment . Thus , a larger positive value of this residual mea - sure is consistent with a greater degree of oversight , and consequently more involvement of senior managers in decisions such as product phaseout . By similar logic , less involvement of senior managers in these decisions is suggested by a negative residual value . The mean of our residual measure was − 0 . 27 , and it ranged from − 4 to 1 . This wide range is consistent with our measure of centralization . Moreover , the two measures exhibit a correlation of 0 . 46 , which suggests these measures are at least partially capturing similar aspects of centralized decision making . Other Controls A variety of controls were included to test for alter - native mechanisms that could affect phaseout . Product replacement is an important part of product portfolio management . For our purposes , a direct replacement is one that is launched within two quarters of its prede - cessor device’s exit and whose launch price is within 10 % of that previous device’s launch price . Our def - inition is consistent with pricing patterns observed in the industry , where marketers tend to “tier” phone offer - ings into price bands . Our results were robust to alterna - tive formulations of this variable in which the window between exit and launch was compressed to one quarter and the price band was doubled to 20 % . We used total ﬁrm sales as a proxy for ﬁrm size , which may have an indirect inﬂuence on the ﬁrm’s decision to cull a device D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 195 . 72 . 238 ] on 02 S e p t e m b e r 2016 , a t 07 : 22 .

Joseph , Klingebiel , and Wilson : Organizational Structure and Performance Feedback Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS 9 ( Henderson and Stern 2004 ) . To account for the infor - mation processing beneﬁts associated with the size of the corporate ofﬁce , we control for absorbed slack ; this is deﬁned as the ratio of corporate selling , general , and administrative expenses to sales . We include a measure of focal ﬁrm product launches , which we develop by counting all phone launches that occur during the focal quarter at the focal ﬁrm to account for interdependen - cies between product launch plans and product exit plans and resource constraints that are ﬁnite within the ﬁrm . Several variables speciﬁc to the technological character - istics of market participants’ portfolios were also used to control for heterogeneity with respect to the number of 3G phones and number of smartphones in a ﬁrm’s portfolio ; this enabled us to capture broad improvement in underlying technologies ( Greenstein and Wade 1998 , de Figueiredo and Kyle 2006 ) . We used a ﬁrm’s average portfolio age in each quarter to capture the degree of portfolio obsolescence . Previous studies ( e . g . , Henderson and Stern 2004 ) have employed unit counts over time to approximate experiential learning in a product - culling environment . We take an analogous approach when measuring capa - bility development over time and use the cumulative phone launches by the focal ﬁrm since 1997 ( the ear - liest data was available ) as a metric for experience . We also included measures of culling experience , cal - culated as the ratio of total products removed from the market ( starting in 1997 ) to the total number of products introduced up through and including the focal quarter , similar to Sorenson ( 2000 ) . For each ﬁrm , we also developed a composite measure that captures its extent of vertical integration ( de Figueiredo and Teece 1996 ) . For each period , we constructed a vertical inte - gration score by summing the number of units within the ﬁrm along the industry value chain : semiconduc - tor , network , media / software , and LCD ; thus , the max - imum score on this measure is 4 . We controlled for two industry - level factors , market density ( total number of competitors’ devices on the market ) and the number of same - period competitors’ phone launches ( count of the number of device launches competitors perform in each period ) ( Sorenson 2000 ) , to account for additional period - speciﬁc market dynamics that may affect culling decisions . All time - varying controls were lagged three periods for consistency with our lag structure . Empirical Speciﬁcation To examine the factors that affect product phaseout , we applied a piecewise exponential hazard rate model ( e . g . , Sørensen and Stuart 2000 ) . This model accounts for right censoring ( recall that left - censored observations were dropped from our sample ) , and it offers ﬂexibility in handling not only time - invariant covariates but also time - varying covariates , including our lagged indepen - dent variables ( Henderson and Stern 2004 ) . Whereas the Figure 1 Kaplan – Meier Survival Graph ( Each Discontinuity Is One Quarter ) 0 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 % s u r v i v i ng Analysis time 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q 5Q exponential speciﬁcation assumes a constant and time - invariant hazard rate , the piecewise speciﬁcation enables us to apply different base hazard rates that depend on the device’s age ; we can thus control for any hetero - geneity in decision - making processes that is driven by age - dependent factors . The clock in this model is device age , and the individual device is our unit of analysis . We remark that this formulation explicitly accounts for time on the market , which allowed us to model different base hazard rates as the device ages and reﬂect man - agerial beliefs that hazard is generally increasing over time . The estimated coefﬁcients can be viewed as gener - ating multipliers of the appropriate underlying base haz - ard rate , which increases as the mobile device ages . In the piecewise analysis , the pieces consist of the follow - ing intervals of device age : 0 – 1 quarters , 1 – 2 quarters , 2 – 3 quarters , 3 – 4 quarters , and more than 4 quarters . A Kaplan – Meier survival graph ( see Figure 1 ) indicates that the hazard rate differs for each of these time periods , so the intervals we used led to signiﬁcant improvements in model ﬁt . Our speciﬁcation follows that given in Blossfeld et al . ( 2007 ) , and we assume a constant hazard rate r(cid:52)t(cid:53) = a for each interval of device age . The underlying survivor function within a piece is G(cid:52)t(cid:53) = e − at ; the hazard rate can be expressed as a i = exp (cid:56)x i (cid:49)(cid:130)(cid:57) , which implies dif - ferent hazard levels for different observations x i . The model’s beta coefﬁcients are estimated using maximum likelihood techniques . Robust standard errors , clustered by ﬁrm , are also reported to account for the nonindepen - dence of the multiple devices for each ﬁrm .

Joseph , Klingebiel , and Wilson : Organizational Structure and Performance Feedback 12 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS replacement device is associated with higher rates of product turnover . This effect becomes signiﬁcant when performance above aspirations is included in the spec - iﬁcation . We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant inverse relation between ﬁrm size and rate of product culling ( p < 0 (cid:48) 001 ) . Large ﬁrms may have additional resources and so are better able to leave products on the market longer ( Bromiley 1991 ) . Absorbed slack has a positive effect on termina - tion decisions , which suggests there are some informa - tion processing advantages of large corporate ofﬁce . 4 We ﬁnd that the launch of new devices within focal period increases the hazard for any particular device ; this is consistent with the logic that the ﬁrm will not want to cannibalize its new devices ( which are sold for higher prices ) with devices at the end of their life cycle . Our technology / feature variables ( 3G and smart - phones ) increased and reduced hazard in our controls only model , respectively , but neither variable was signiﬁ - cant . They remain largely insigniﬁcant across all speciﬁ - cations . These two key technological developments were in relatively early stages in our sample , and it is not yet clear that the industry had yet fully adjusted to these technologies in terms of product phaseout processes . We ﬁnd no relationship between average portfolio age and culling . We ﬁnd a marginally signiﬁcant negative effect ( p < 0 (cid:48) 10 ) relating cumulative phone launches to phaseout . Contrary to results reported in Sorenson ( 2000 ) and in Henderson and Stern ( 2004 ) , the coefﬁ - cient for our degree of culling experience variable is not signiﬁcant ; in other words , current culling rates seem largely unrelated to previous rates in the same market . Note that the average product life ( 4 . 3 mean quarters of product time on market ) was much shorter in our study than in those by Sorenson ( 2000 ) , who examined workstations ( 2 . 84 mean years of product time on mar - ket ) , and Henderson and Stern ( 2004 ) , who examined personal computers ( 2 . 31 mean years ) . In line with de Figueiredo and Teece ( 1996 ) , we ﬁnd that vertical inte - gration in upstream product development capability has a signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁrm’s downstream exit rates ; this follows because such ﬁrms can more effectively navigate interdependencies in product development and manufacturing . We ﬁnd that the number of competitors’ launches increases the likelihood of culling , while the number of competitors’ phones on the market lowers the likelihood that a product is culled . These results are con - sistent with our qualitative interviews , which suggested that managers actively engage in scanning the competi - tive landscape and evaluating the performance of com - peting devices and may adjust product phaseout timing to coincide with competitor moves . Model ( 2 ) shows how phone - level feedback affects phaseout when performance is above aspirations . Con - sistent with H1A , we ﬁnd that performance above aspirations is associated with a decreasing hazard of product phaseout at the p < 0 (cid:48) 01 level . This ﬁnding accords with our argument that product managers main - tain the status quo when performance is above aspira - tions . For models ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , which show the squared term and survival - level indicator approaches to test H1B , we ﬁnd that the linear term is signiﬁcant and negative at the p < 0 (cid:48) 001 level , suggesting that managers engage in local search for solutions when performance falls moderately below aspirations . Furthermore , the squared term in model ( 3 ) is positive and signiﬁcant ( p < 0 (cid:48) 001 ) just as the survival - level indicator variable is positive and signiﬁcant in model ( 4 ) ( p < 0 (cid:48) 001 ) . These ﬁndings indicate that when performance falls sufﬁciently below aspirations , attention shifts to survival , the exhaustion of solutions , and phaseout . We note the better ﬁt of the survival - level indicator variable approach , consistent with prior studies ( Miller and Chen 2004 , Boyle and Shapira 2012 ) that use a discrete cutoff for survival . Model ( 5 ) tests H2 and examines the effect of cen - tralization measure on phaseout . Consistent with H2 , we ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcient for centraliza - tion in model ( 5 ) ( p < 0 (cid:48) 05 ) ; the main effect coefﬁcient is positive across all speciﬁcations , suggesting that the coordination properties of centralized structures facili - tate phaseout behavior . Models ( 6 ) – ( 8 ) show how centralization conditions the effects of performance feedback on phaseout . Model ( 6 ) shows the interaction of performance above aspirations and centralization . Model ( 7 ) shows the inter - action of both performance below aspirations and per - formance below aspirations squared with centralization . Model ( 8 ) replaces the squared term and its interaction with the survival - level indicator variable and its inter - action . We emphasize that the “main effect” of feed - back cannot be interpreted as simply the coefﬁcient for the phone - level feedback variable ( Jaccard and Turrisi 2003 ) because the coefﬁcient for the main effect repre - sents its inﬂuence when the other term in the interaction is zero . Yet in our sample the zero value is meaning - less : it does not occur because centralization is mea - sured on a 1 to 5 scale . 5 Accordingly , the formal test for H3A is whether the centralization - performance feedback interaction variable in model ( 6 ) is signiﬁcant and neg - ative . We ﬁnd support for H3A ( p < 0 (cid:48) 05 ) ; centraliza - tion reduces the likelihood of culling when performance is above aspirations . In model ( 7 ) , which examines the squared term interaction , we lose signiﬁcance on the main effect of performance below aspirations as well as the squared term and respective interaction terms . In model ( 8 ) , which uses the survival - level indicator vari - able to identify devices below the survival threshold , we ﬁnd support for H3B , as the interaction terms between the centralization variable and our performance below aspirations and survival - level indicator variables are pos - itive and signiﬁcant at p < 0 (cid:48) 01 and p < 0 (cid:48) 001 levels , respectively . Again , we ﬁnd the survival - level indicator approach is a better representation of our data .

We note that the signiﬁcance of the survival - level indicator and interaction variable is slightly weakened ( though still statistically signiﬁcant ) in model ( 10 ) compared to model ( 8 ) . As noted above , the survival - level indicator approach remains a better ﬁt to our data than the squared term approach . Conse - quently , we use this model to graph our key ﬁndings in Figure 2 . The x - axis of Figure 2 corresponds to perfor - mance relative to aspirations and the y - axis to the prob - ability that a median device will survive four quarters . The graph plots two lines representing different values of centralization ( 2 and 4 ) , which illustrate how centraliza - tion affects the likelihood of phaseout after four quarters at different levels of performance relative to aspirations . All displayed values are within the data range . Figure 2 makes an important point by demonstrat - ing that product phaseout depends on the ﬁrm’s degree of centralization . The net effect of centralization can either increase or decrease the hazard of phaseout , which suggests a critical link between the behavioral mech - anism of performance feedback and the structure of a ﬁrm’s decision making . The coefﬁcient for the interac - tion between performance above aspirations and central - ization is statistically signiﬁcant in model ( 10 ) ( p < 0 (cid:48) 05 ) , and the rate of change of phaseout for an organization with a high degree of centralization is striking . As per - formance increases above aspirations , a 13 - percentage - point difference in the likelihood of retaining a product between organizations with high and low centralization decreases to a 2 - percentage - point difference at the 75th percentile of performance above aspirations . Consistent with H3B , we ﬁnd that decentralized organizations react quite differently to negative feedback than do central - ized organizations . As performance becomes worse rel - ative to aspirations , the difference in culling between Figure 2 ( Color online ) The Effect on Product Phaseout of Centralization and of Performance Relative to Aspirations .

Robustness Models ( 11 ) – ( 14 ) , which are included in Table 3 , test the robustness of our ﬁndings . These models build on the survival - level indicator approach used in model ( 10 ) , which was the best ﬁtting model . Model ( 11 ) repli - cates model ( 10 ) while removing from the sample all devices that were also launched in the United States , South Korea , or the United Kingdom . This allowed us to account for any inﬂuence of large markets ( e . g . , United States , United Kingdom , South Korea ) , and in the case of the United States and Korea , the home mar - kets for three of our ﬁve ﬁrms . For both measures of centralization , we identiﬁed less than a third of devices as being strictly German ( which leaves us with 1 , 053 product - quarters , comprising 151 product exits across 191 devices ) . Even so , all of our hypotheses remain sup - ported in this German - only sample . To account for organizational and temporal idiosyn - crasies that may broadly affect phaseout patterns , we incorporate both ﬁrm and year dummy variables as an additional sensitivity analysis . Model ( 12 ) shows the results of adding ﬁrm and year dummies to model ( 10 ) . When these dummies are included in the regression , the results are similar to those reported in model ( 10 ) . 6 We note reduced signiﬁcance on our survival - level indica - tor variable ( p < 0 (cid:48) 10 level ) . Note that incorporating ﬁrm and year dummies does not improve the model’s statistical ﬁt at the 5 % level of signiﬁcance ( i . e . , a log - likelihood test comparing the ﬁt of model ( 10 ) versus D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 195 . 72 . 238 ] on 02 S e p t e m b e r 2016 , a t 07 : 22 .

It is therefore reasonable to conclude that a model excluding these parameters yields a statistically similar and thus adequate ﬁt to the data .

A t - test between these samples found that the phones in each sample did not differ signiﬁcantly ( at the p < 0 (cid:48) 05 level ) with regard to either sales or price , indicating that both samples contain generally similar devices . In model ( 13 ) , which uses the oversight variable in lieu of our central - ization measure , we generally ﬁnd a pattern of sign and signiﬁcance similar to that in model ( 10 ) . In model ( 14 ) , which uses the oversight variable as an additional con - trol for centralization ( centered to account for possible collinearity ) , we again report ﬁndings consistent with model ( 10 ) , though the interaction term between central - ization and performance above aspirations loses signiﬁ - cance at the p < 0 (cid:48) 05 level . Finally , our ability to interpret the estimated coefﬁ - cients on structure as representing causal effects hinges on the extent to which centralization is exogenous . While it is indeed plausible that a poorly performing ﬁrm may centralize ( thus making centralization endoge - nous to performance ) , it is much less likely that a sin - gle poorly performing product would drive ﬁrms of this size to centralize their structure and corresponding rou - tines , communication channels , and informal interac - tions . Interviews with industry executives indicate that because the portfolio management process is highly rou - tinized ( e . g . , ﬁrms introduce an average of 4 . 37 phones and cull 4 . 24 phones per quarter ) , the degree of central - ization does not vary across products . To assess potential endogeneity more directly , we reran our analysis remov - ing extreme blockbuster and failure products ( which might otherwise garner more top management attention ) and found no difference in results . We then regressed the degree of centralization from 2004 through 2009 on the rate of product culling and ﬁrm performance ( mea - sured by sales ) during the same time period , ﬁnding no relationship between these performance measures and degree of centralization . We repeated this analysis using our measure of oversight , again ﬁnding no relationship . Overall , we conclude that endogeneity of structure is unlikely driving our results . Discussion and Conclusion This study develops a model to explain the effects of organizational structure and performance feedback on termination decisions . In particular , we examined the effects of centralized and decentralized decision - making structures on product phaseout in the mobile device industry . Much of the behavioral theory research implic - itly assumes that performance feedback induces uniform responses irrespective of the ﬁrm’s decision - making structure . However , we reasoned that this may not be the case because structure shapes not only information processing , but also attention to problems and solutions . We argued ﬁrst that , owing to consolidated authority and vertical communication patterns , ﬁrms with centralized structures demonstrate decision making and coordina - tion patterns that , ceteris paribus , increase the rate of phaseout . Second , we argued that perceptions of prob - lems and solutions vary across the vertical hierarchy—as do the corresponding responses to feedback . Centralized structures focus managerial attention on all products , and when addressing performance problems , they initiate strategic actions that affect the entire portfolio . Rather than make tactical changes to each product , centralized decision makers shift resources from lower - to higher - performing products and cull the poor performers more quickly . Our study makes several contributions . First , we offer new insights into the determinants of product phase - out and termination decisions more broadly . Termination and its inverse ( retention ) have long been of inter - est to economists , psychologists , and organizational scholars . The phenomena of termination , abandonment , and exit have been linked to a variety of population - level ( Hannan and Freeman 1984 ) , industry - level ( Greve 1995 ) , organizational - level ( Mitchell 1994 , Guler 2007 , Shimizu 2007 , Klingebiel 2012 , Gaba and Dokko 2015 ) , and individual - level ( Staw et al . 1981 ) drivers . We augment this body of work by highlighting the joint contribution of structure and behavioral factors and , in particular , the nature of feedback within corporate hier - archies . For example , we do ﬁnd some evidence con - sistent with the escalation of commitment to a course of action ( Staw et al . 1981 , Guler 2007 ) . Studies show that people tend to commit more resources to the activ - ity that caused the loss to justify the prior commitment . Yet our ﬁndings and data do not fully reﬂect escalation behavior . Our results suggest that centralized structures exhibit less escalation behavior than decentralized struc - tures , even as performance decreases . This ﬁnding runs counter to extant research ( e . g . , Gilbert 2005 ) charac - terizing management as unduly rigid , and suggests the idiosyncratic attention paid to problems and alternatives plays a role in the commitment to a prior course of action . 7 Second , this study augments the growing scholarship on performance feedback by considering important con - ditional effects imposed by structure . The role of orga - nizational structure has been largely absent in studies of performance feedback , and the results of this study argue for more research linking cognitive and structural expla - nations of adaptive behavior . Our results make clear that forces reducing the rate of phaseout are not dispersed uniformly throughout the ﬁrm ; in other words , the spatial and temporal conjunction of certain players and types of feedback are consequential . A corresponding yet broader contribution of this paper is to link key pillars of the Carnegie school : hierarchy and aspirations . For the most part , these pillars have been developed independently ; the result is a wealth of theory for each that is largely D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 195 . 72 . 238 ] on 02 S e p t e m b e r 2016 , a t 07 : 22 .

This study integrates them in sup - port of neo - Carnegie scholars who call for a focus on a “renewed behaviorally plausible , decision - centered per - spective on organization” ( Gavetti et al . 2007 , p . 525 ) . In response , we offer here a structure – feedback theory of organizational decision making that integrates hierar - chy and aspirations while placing in sharper relief the inﬂuence of decision - making procedures used by com - plex organizations . As a third contribution , our focus on centralization expands the scope of theory concerning organization design and builds on the classic and contemporary research in this ﬁeld ( Burton and Obel 2004 ) . We document in particular that the role of organizational structure in decision making involves more than infor - mation processing , and we highlight the effect of struc - ture on situated attention ( Ocasio 1997 ) —what we call situated selection . The logic of situated selection is distinct from traditional information processing views ( Galbraith 1974 , Tushman and Nadler 1978 ) . In the lat - ter , the problem for decision makers is one of matching information processing capacity to the level of environ - mental complexity . From the situated selection perspec - tive , however , the problem facing decision makers is one of identifying which problems and solutions they should consider . In this view , then , information is not uniformly processed , but instead is attended to and responded to idiosyncratically , contingent on the vertical location of the decision maker in the hierarchy . In the context of situated selection , choice is guided by the locus of deci - sion making and local interactions , rather than by uni - versal structural or strategic controls or the external environment . Managerial decisions , contingent on the attention - directing qualities of the structure , determine whether individual strategies , products and technologies are retained or eliminated . Our research joins a growing number of recent studies that show design choices affecting organizational out - comes ( e . g . , Christensen and Knudsen 2010 , Cardinal et al . 2011 , Boumgarden et al . 2012 , Karim and Kaul 2015 ) , yet it focuses speciﬁcally on the attentional impli - cations of structure ( see Rhee et al . 2014 , Sengul and Obloj 2014 ) . Our ﬁndings are also consistent with stud - ies which show that hierarchies are more conservative in allocating resources to products ( Christensen and Knud - sen 2010 , Csaszar 2012 ) . For example , research shows that centralized structures often require that resource allocation decisions need to be validated by successive ranks of the hierarchy , and as a result are likely to grant fewer resources to product maintenance ( or any product ) . Although we are agnostic as to the particular screening behavior of the ﬁrm , it would clearly amplify our ﬁnd - ings regarding centralization . As Figure 2 illustrates , high levels of decentralization may alter the interpretation of performance below aspi - rations ( and hence the response to that performance ) dif - ferently than do high levels of centralization . Although research has demonstrated that the interpretation of information becomes more distorted under greater cen - tralization ( Sutcliffe 1994 ) , a decentralized structure cre - ates specialized attention channels and so provides fewer global signals to those making decisions ( Puranam et al . 2006 , Csaszar 2012 ) . Our model of centralized feed - back may be the most suitable—at mean levels of performance—if rapid phaseout is desired or required . It is worth noting that Apple , when lead by Steve Jobs , was quite successful with centralized decision making . How - ever , the business model of Apple differed greatly from that of large manufacturers ( e . g . , Nokia and Samsung ) and led to relatively few product introductions , simplify - ing the corresponding phaseout process . So even though our study has clear implications for the decision process across many of these areas , more work is needed if we are to understand better the performance implications of linking feedback and particular structures . An obvious limitation of this study is that our data cover a particular and limited period in the mobile device industry . This period was one of great turbu - lence and technological change , as 3G technology was still nascent and a dominant design had yet to emerge . The ﬁrst iPhone was launched near the end of our sample period , during which network externalities pro - vided by the Android and iOS operating systems had not been developed . Another limitation is that the global mobile device industry had relatively few large play - ers . Although we were able to exploit intraﬁrm varia - tion in decision - making structure , future research might usefully investigate whether the level of decision mak - ing accounts for meaningful variance in smaller ﬁrms , too . Likewise , the degree of interdependencies in phase - out activities across ﬁrms was largely the same , which suggests an opportunity for future studies to examine the degree of interdependencies in decision making as a boundary condition . Finally , caution should be exercised when generalizing our ﬁndings to other industries . The scope of what constitutes a “new” product in this indus - try may differ from what is a considered a new product in other industries . For example , most new products in the mobile device industry reﬂect incremental changes to predecessors rather than architectural or radical shifts . Future research could examine the effects of structure on product portfolio decisions across a greater variety of product categories . Given the renewed interest in corporate - level effects on performance and the increased attention being de - voted to organizational architecture ( Gulati et al . 2012 ) , it seems that the ﬁelds of strategy and organization the - ory are ready for more studies on the role of attention in complex ﬁrms . This paper is an early step in that direc - tion . Although we are beginning to see other work in this vein ( e . g . , Gavetti 2005 , Rerup 2009 , Csaszar and Eggers 2013 ) , more research is needed to illuminate the D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 195 . 72 . 238 ] on 02 S e p t e m b e r 2016 , a t 07 : 22 .

Our study at least partially substantiates the claim that because structure can affect attention , sense making , and decision mak - ing , it is fertile ground for future studies and provides a platform on which other researchers may build .

Endnotes 1 Less is known about how managers form reference groups ( Greve 1998 ) ; hence , deﬁning the social group relevant to comparable products would prove extremely difﬁcult in the mobile phone industry , where devices compete—with respect to technology , features , and prices—not only within a given product generation but also across generations . 2 An alternative speciﬁcation is to utilize a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 when performance is above aspirations ( Bromiley and Harris 2014 ) . Inclusion of the dummy term in the model allows for a discontinuity at the point where per - formance is equal to aspirations . Results from this alternative speciﬁcation do not differ from our approach and are available from the authors . 3 Our ﬁndings are not sensitive to changes ( e . g . , 10 % , 15 % ) in the chosen threshold . 4 Prior literature ( Gaba and Joseph 2013 ) has found a rela - tionship between corporate - level and business - unit - level per - formance feedback and the launch of new products . While we ﬁnd an impact of product launch on phaseout , we ﬁnd no sig - niﬁcant effects of corporate - and business - unit - level feedback on product phaseout . 5 In model ( 6 ) , for example , performance feedback above aspi - rations slows phaseout at all values of centralization ( with an implied coefﬁcient of − 0 (cid:48) 008 (cid:54) 0 (cid:48) 002 + 2 ∗− 0 (cid:48) 005 (cid:55) at a central - ization of 2 and − 0 (cid:48) 023 (cid:54) 0 (cid:48) 002 + 5 ∗− 0 (cid:48) 005 (cid:55) at a centralization of 5 ) . Consequently , the effects of performance feedback above aspirations in models ( 6 ) , ( 9 ) , and ( 10 ) all demonstrate a sim - ilar effect ( with differing magnitudes depending on the degree of centralization ) as in model ( 2 ) , which shows the main effect of performance feedback above aspirations only . 6 Our results are also robust to the inclusion of either ﬁrm or year dummies separately . 7 Problem solving in the face of limited information and esca - lating commitment both differ also from structural inertia , a third possible explanation for the observed behavior . However , it is unlikely that inertia explains our ﬁndings . Phaseout is a central part of the portfolio management process , and proce - dures are in place to ensure that it occurs within a reason - able period of time following a sales decline . Both lower - and upper - level managers are capable enough to cull products , and neither should be disadvantaged in terms of the structures or routines that allow them to do so . Our empirical results bear this expectation out , since the conventional wisdom is that the senior management levels are characterized by greater behav - ioral inertia , or less adaptive behavior ( Tripsas and Gavetti 2000 ) . In contrast , we ﬁnd that centralized structures always exhibit faster culling .
