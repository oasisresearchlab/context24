ARTICLE The effect of publishing peer review reports on referee behavior in ﬁ ve scholarly journals Giangiacomo Bravo 1 , Francisco Grimaldo 2 , Emilia López - Iñesta 3 , Bahar Mehmani 4 & Flaminio Squazzoni 5 To increase transparency in science , some scholarly journals are publishing peer review reports . But it is unclear how this practice affects the peer review process . Here , we examine the effect of publishing peer review reports on referee behavior in ﬁ ve scholarly journals involved in a pilot study at Elsevier . By considering 9 , 220 submissions and 18 , 525 reviews from 2010 to 2017 , we measured changes both before and during the pilot and found that publishing reports did not signi ﬁ cantly compromise referees ’ willingness to review , recommendations , or turn - around times . Younger and non - academic scholars were more willing to accept to review and provided more positive and objective recommendations . Male referees tended to write more constructive reports during the pilot . Only 8 . 1 % of referees agreed to reveal their identity in the published report . These ﬁ ndings suggest that open peer review does not compromise the process , at least when referees are able to protect their anonymity . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 08250 - 2 OPEN 1 Department of Social Studies and Centre for Data Intensive Sciences and Applications , Linnaeus University , 35195 Växjö , Sweden . 2 Department of Computer Science , University of Valencia , Av . de la Universitat , s / n , 46100 Burjassot , Spain . 3 Department of Didactics of Mathematics , University of Valencia , Av .

This sense of urgency is due to the increased importance of publications for tenure and promotion in an academic job market , which is now hypercompetitive worldwide 2 . Not only could biased peer review distort academic credit allocation ; bias could also have - negative implications on scienti ﬁ c knowledge and innovation , and erode the legitimacy and credibility of science 3 – 6 . Under the imperative of open science , certain learned societies , publishers and journals have started to experiment with open peer review as a means to open the black box of internal journal processes 7 – 9 . The need for more openness and transparency of peer review has been a subject of debate since the 1990s 10 – 12 . Recently , some journals , such as The EMBO Journal , eLife and those from Frontiers , have enabled various forms of pre - publication interaction and collaboration between referees , edi - tors and in some cases even authors , with F1000 implementing advanced collaborative platforms to engage referees in post - publication open reviews . Although very important , these experiments have not led to a univocal and consensual framework 13 , 14 . This is because they have been performed only by individual journals , and mostly without any attempts to measure the effect of manipulation of peer review across different journals 15 , 16 . Our study aims to ﬁ ll this gap by presenting data on an open peer review pilot run at ﬁ ve Elsevier journals in different ﬁ elds simultaneously , in which referees were asked to agree to publish their reports . Starting with 62 , 790 individual observations , including 9220 submissions and 18 , 525 completed reviews from 2010 to 2017 , we estimated referee behavior before and during the pilot in a quasi natural experiment . In order to minimize any bias due to the non - experimental randomization of these ﬁ ve pilot journals , we accessed similar data on a set of comparable Elsevier journals , so achieving a total number of 138 , 117 individual observations , including 21 , 647 manuscripts ( pilot + group con - trol journals ) . Our aim was to understand whether knowing that their report would be published affected the referees ’ willingness to review , the type of recommendations , the turn - around time and the tone of the report . These are all aspects that must be considered when assessing the viability and sustainability of open peer review . By reconstructing the gender and academic status of referees , we also wanted to understand whether these innovations were perceived differently by certain categories of scholars 8 , 17 . It is important here to note that while open peer review is an umbrella term for different approaches to transparency 13 , pub - lishing peer review reports is probably the most important and less problematic form . Unlike pre - publication open interaction , post - publication or decoupled reviews , this form of openness neither requires complex management technologies nor it depends on external resources ( e . g . , a self - organized volunteer community ) . At the same time , not only do open peer review reports increase transparency of the process , they also stimulate reviewer recognition and transform reports in training material for other referees 1 , 7 , 8 . Results The Pilot . In November 2014 , ﬁ ve Elsevier journals agreed to be involved in the Publication of Peer Review reports as articles ( from now on , PPR ) pilot . During the pilot , these ﬁ ve journals openly published typeset peer review reports with a separate DOI , fully citable and linked to the published article on ScienceDirect . Review reports were published freely available regardless of the journal ’ s subscription model ( two of these journals were open access , while three were published under the subscription - based model ) . For each accepted article , all revision round review reports were concatenated under the ﬁ rst round for each referee , with all content published as a single review report . Different sections were used in cases of multiple revision rounds . For the sake of simplicity , once agreed to review , referees were not given any opt - out choice and were asked to give their consent to reveal their identity . In agreement with all journal editors , a text was added to the invitation letter to inform referees about the PPR pilot and their options . At the same time , authors themselves were fully informed about the PPR when they submitted their manuscripts . Note that while one of these journals started the pilot earlier in 2012 , for all journals the pilot ended in 2017 ( further details as SI ) . Figure 1 shows the overall submission trend in these ﬁ ve journals during the period considered in this study . We found a general upward trend in the number of submissions , although this probably did not re ﬂ ect - speci ﬁ c trends due to the pilot ( see details in the SI ﬁ le ) . Following previous studies 18 , in order to increase the coherence of our analysis , we only considered the ﬁ rst round of Pilot start Journal 1 Pilot start other journals 0 100 200 300 2010 2012 2014 2016 Date N . o f s ub m i ss i on s pe r m on t h Journal 1 Journal 2 Journal 3 Journal 4 Journal 5 Fig . 1 Number of monthly submissions in the pilot journals ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 08250 - 2 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 322 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 08250 - 2 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications review , i . e . , 85 % of observations in our dataset . For observation , we meant any relevant event and activity that were recorded in the journal database , e . g . , the day a referee responded to the invitation or the recommendation he / she provided ( see Methods ) Willingness to review . We found that only 22 , 488 ( 35 . 8 % ) of invited referees eventually agreed to review , with a noticeable difference before and after the beginning of the pilot , 43 . 6 % vs . 30 . 9 % . However , it is worth noting that while the acceptance rate varied signi ﬁ cantly among journals , there was an overall declining trend , possibly starting before the beginning of the pilot ( Fig . 2 ) . Descriptive statistics also highlighted certain changes in referee pro ﬁ le . More senior academic professors agreed less to review during the pilot , whereas younger scholars , with or without a Ph . D . degree , were more keen to review . We did not ﬁ nd any relevant gender effect ( Fig . 3 ) . The ﬁ rst impression was that the number of potential referees who accepted to review actually declined to do so in the pilot . However , considering that the number of review invitations increased over time , this may have simply re ﬂ ected the larger number of editorial requests . To control for these possible confounding factors , we estimated a mixed - effect logistic model with referees ’ acceptance of editors ’ invitation as outcome . To consider the problem of repeated observations on the same paper and the across - journal nature of the dataset , we also included random effects for both the individual submission and the journal . Besides the open review dummy , we estimated ﬁ xed effects for the year , where the start date of the dataset was indicated as zero and each subsequent year by increasing integers , the referee ’ s declared status , with “ professor ” , “ doctor ” and “ other ” as levels , and the referee ’ s gender , with three levels , “ female ” , “ male ” and “ uncertain ” ( in case our text mining algorithm did not assign a speci ﬁ c gender ) . The year variable allowed us to control for any underlying trend in the data , such as the increased number of submissions and reviews , or the increased referee pool .

Results suggest that the apparent decline of review invitation acceptance simply re ﬂ ected a time trend , which was independent of the open review condition and probably due to the increasing number of submissions and requests . The pure effect of the open review condition was not statistically signi ﬁ cant . Furthermore , although several referee characteristics had an effect on the willingness of reviewing , only the interaction effect with the “ other ” status was signi ﬁ cant . Referees without a professor or doctoral degree , and so probably younger or non - academic , were actually more keen to review during the pilot . However , by comparing the pilot with a sample of ﬁ ve comparable Elsevier journals , we found that this decline of willingness to review was neither journal - speci ﬁ c nor trial - induced , i . e . , in ﬂ uenced by open peer review ( see Supplementary Tables 1 – 3 and Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Recommendations . The distribution of recommendations chan - ged slightly during the pilot , with more frequent rejections and major revisions ( Fig . 4 ) . On the other hand , the distribution of recommendations by referees who accepted to have their names published with the report was noticeably different , with many more - positive recommendations . Given that revealing identity was a decision made by referees themselves after completing their review , it is probable that these differences in recommendations could re ﬂ ect a self - selection process . Referees who wrote more - positive reviews were more keen to reveal their identity later as a reputational signal to authors and the community . However , it is worth noting that only a small minority of referees ( about 8 . 1 % ) accepted to have their names published together with their report . In order to control for time trends and journal characteristics , we estimated another model , including the open review dummy and all relevant interaction effects . As the outcome was an ordinal variable with four levels ( reject , major revisions , minor revisions , accept ) , we estimated a mixed - effect cumulative - link model including the same random and ﬁ xed effects as the previous model . Table 2 shows that the pilot did not bias recommenda - tions . Among the various referee characteristics , only referee status had any signi ﬁ cant interaction effect , with younger and non - academic referees ( i . e . , the “ other ” group ) who submitted on average more positive recommendations . Note that these results were con ﬁ rmed by our robustness check test with ﬁ ve comparable Elsevier journals not involved in the pilot ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Review time . We analysed the number of days referees took to submit their report before and after the beginning of the pilot . Previous research suggests that open peer review could increase review time as referees could be inclined to write their reports in more structured and correct language , given that they are even - tually published 8 . The average 28 . 2 ± 4 . 6 days referees took to complete their reports before the pilot increased to 30 . 4 ± 4 . 4 days during it . However , after estimating models that considered the increasing number of observations over time , we did not ﬁ nd any signi ﬁ cant effect on turn - round time ( see Table 3 ) . When con - sidering interaction effects , we only found that referees with a doctoral degree tended to take more time to complete their Table 1 Mixed - effects logistic model on the acceptance of editors ’ invitation by referees Fixed effects Estimate Std . error z - value p - value ( Intercept ) − 0 . 193 0 . 214 − 0 . 901 0 . 368 Open review − 0 . 025 0 . 073 − 0 . 343 0 . 713 Status : Other − 0 . 476 0 . 050 − 9 . 476 < 0 . 001 Status : Dr − 0 . 135 0 . 030 − 4 . 436 < 0 . 001 Gender : Male 0 . 277 0 . 049 5 . 643 < 0 . 001 Gender : Uncertain 0 . 338 0 . 055 6 . 164 < 0 . 001 Year − 0 . 121 0 . 008 − 14 . 415 < 0 . 001 Open review × Status : Other 0 . 278 0 . 069 4 . 020 < 0 . 001 Open review × Status : Dr 0 . 012 0 . 042 0 . 279 0 . 781 Open review × Gender : Male − 0 . 014 0 . 062 − 0 . 219 0 . 827 Open review × Gender : Uncertain 0 . 005 0 . 070 0 . 074 0 . 941 Std .

Note that results were further con ﬁ rmed by analysing ﬁ ve comparable Elsevier journals not involved in the pilot ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Review reports . In order to examine whether the linguistic style of reports changed during the pilot , we performed a sentiment analysis on the text of reports by considering polarity — i . e . , whether the tone of the report was mainly negative or positive ( varying in the [ − 1 , 1 ] interval , with larger numbers indicating a more positive tone ) — and subjectivity — i . e . , whether the style used in the reports was predominantly objective ( [ 0 , 1 ] interval , higher numbers indicating more subjective reports ) . A graphical analysis showed only minimal differences before and during the pilot , with reviews only slightly more severe and objective in the open peer review condition ( Fig . 5 ) . Two mixed - effects models were estimated using the polarity and subjectivity indexes as outcome . The pilot dummy , the recommendation , the ( log of ) the number of characters of the report , the year , and the gender and status of the referees ( plus interactions ) , respectively , were included as ﬁ xed effects . As before , the submission and journal IDs were used as random effects . Table 4 shows that the pure effect of open review was not signi ﬁ cant . However , we found a positive and signi ﬁ cant interaction effect with gender . Indeed , male referees tended to write more - positive reports under the open review condition , although this effect was statistically signi ﬁ cant only at the 5 % level . However , considering the large number of observations in our dataset , any inference to open peer review effects from such a signi ﬁ cance level should be considered cautiously 19 .

Discussion Our ﬁ ndings suggest that open peer review does not compromise the inner workings of the peer review system . Indeed , we did not ﬁ nd any signi ﬁ cant negative effects on referees ’ willingness to review , their recommendations , or turn - around time . This contradicts recent research on individual cases , in which various forms of open peer review had a negative effect on these same factors 16 , 20 . Here , only younger and non - academic referees were slightly sensitive to the pilot . They were more keen to accept to review , more objective in their reports , and less demanding on the quality of submissions when under open peer review , but effects were minor .

While this could be expected in case referees opting to reveal their identity , as this could be a reputational signal for future cooperation by published authors , this was also true when referees decided not to reveal their identity . However , it is worth noting that unlike recent survey results 14 , here only 8 . 1 % of referees agreed to reveal their identity . Although certain bene ﬁ ts of open science and open evaluation are incontrovertible 21 , 22 , our ﬁ ndings suggest that the veil of anon - ymity is key also for open peer review . It is probable that this re ﬂ ects the need for protection from possible retaliation or other unforeseen implications of open peer review , perhaps as a con - sequence of the hyper - competition that currently dominates academic institutions and organizations 23 , 24 . In any case , this means that research is still needed to understand the appropriate level of transparency and openness of internal processes of scholarly journals 8 , 13 . In this respect , although our cross - journal dataset allowed us to have a more composite and less fragmented picture of peer review 25 , it is possible that our ﬁ ndings were still context speci ﬁ c . For instance , a recent survey on scientists ’ attitudes towards open peer review revealed that scholars in certain ﬁ elds , such as the humanities and social sciences , were more skeptical about these innovations 14 . Previous research suggests that peer review re ﬂ ects epistemic differences in evaluation standards and disciplinary traditions 26 , 27 . Furthermore , while here we focused on referee behavior , it is probable that open peer review could in ﬂ uence author behavior and publication strategies , making journals more or less attractive also depending on their type of peer review and their level of transparency . This indicates that the feasibility and sustainability of open peer review could be context speci ﬁ c and that the diversity of current experiments probably re ﬂ ects this awareness by respon - sible editors and publishers 8 , 13 , 14 . While large - scale comparisons and across - journal experimental tests are required to improve our understanding of these relevant innovations , these efforts are also necessary to sustain an evidence - based journal management culture . Methods Our dataset included records concerning authors , reviewers and handling editors of all peer reviewed manuscripts submitted to the ﬁ ve journals included in the pilot . The data included 62 , 790 observations linked to 9220 submissions and 18 , 525 completed reviews from January 2010 to November 2017 . Sharing internal journal data were possible thanks to a protocol signed by the COST Action PEERE representatives and Elsevier 28 . We applied text mining techniques to estimate the gender of referees by using two Python libraries that contain more than 250 , 000 names from 80 countries and languages , namely gender - guesser 0 . 4 . 0 and genderize . io . This allowed us to minimize the number of “ uncertain ” cases ( 20 . 7 % ) . For each subject , we calculated his / her academic status as ﬁ lled in the journal management platform and per - formed an alphanumeric case - insensitive matching in the concatenation of title and academic degree . This allowed us to assign everyone the status of “ professor ” ( i . e . , full , associate or assistant professors ) , “ Doctor ” ( i . e . , someone who held a doc - torate ) , and “ Other ” ( i . e . , an engineer , BSc , MSc , PhD candidate , or a non - academic expert ) . To perform the sentiment analysis of the report text , we used a pattern analyzer provided by the TextBlob 0 . 15 . 0 library in Python , which averages the scores of terms found in a lexicon of around 2900 English words that occur frequently in product reviews . TextBlob is one of the most commonly used libraries to perform sentiment analysis and extract polarity and subjectivity from texts . It is based on two standard libraries to perform natural language processing in Python , that is , Pattern and NLTK ( Natural Language Toolkit ) . We used the former to crawl and parse a variety of online text sources , while the latter , which has more than 50 corpora and lexical resources , allowed us to process text for classi ﬁ cation , toke - nization , stemming , tagging , parsing , and semantic reasoning 29 . This allowed us to consider valence shifters ( i . e . , negators , ampli ﬁ ers ( intensi ﬁ ers ) , de - ampli ﬁ ers ( downtoners ) , and adversative conjunctions ) through an augmented dictionary lookup . Note that we considered only reports including at least 250 characters , corresponding to a few lines of text . All statistical analyses were performed using the R 3 . 4 . 4 platform 30 with the following additional packages : lme4 , lmerTest , ordinal and simpleboot . Plots were produced using the ggplot2 package . The dataset and R script used to estimate the models are provided as supplementary information . Mixed - effects linear models ( Tables 1 , 3 – 5 ) included random effects ( random intercepts ) for submissions and journals . The mixed - effects cumulative - link model 31 ( Table 2 ) used the same random effects structure of the linear models . This allowed us to test different model speci ﬁ cations , with all predictors except the open review dummy and the year either dropped or sequentially included . Note that the p - value for the open review dummy was never below conventional sig - ni ﬁ cance thresholds . To test our ﬁ ndings robustness , we selected ﬁ ve extra Elsevier journals as a control group . These journals were selected to match the discipline / ﬁ eld , impact factor , number of submissions and submission dynamics of the ﬁ ve pilot journals .

Degrees of freedom were computed using Satterthwaite ’ s approximation NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 08250 - 2 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 322 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 08250 - 2 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 7 We included both the pilot and control journals in three separate models to esti - mate their effect on willingness to review , referee recommendations and review time . Results con ﬁ rmed our ﬁ ndings ( see details in the SI ﬁ le ) . While all robustness checks provided in the SI ﬁ le allowed us to con ﬁ rm our ﬁ ndings , it is worth noting that our individual observations could be sensitive to dependency . Indeed , the same referee could have reviewed many manuscripts either for the same or for other journals ( this case was perhaps less probable given the different journal domains ) . While unfortunately we could not obtain consistent referee IDs across journals , we believe that the potential effect of this dependency on our models was minimal considering the large size of the dataset . Data availability The journal dataset required a data sharing agreement to be established between authors and Elsevier . The agreement was possible thanks to the data sharing protocol entitled “ TD1306 COST Action New frontiers of peer review ( PEERE ) policy on data sharing on peer review ” , which was signed by all partners involved in this research on 1 March 2017 . The protocol was as part of a collaborative project funded by the EU Commission 28 . The dataset and data scripts are available as source data ﬁ les .
