The COVID - Net 27 surveillance network covered all Australian states and territories , with an estimated population 28 of 25 , 649 , 985 persons as at 31 June 2020 . We reported the epidemiology of COVID - 19 29 outbreaks in Australia , including the setting in which they occurred , size , and duration . 30 853 outbreaks of COVID - 19 were reported ; associated with 13 , 957 confirmed cases , of 31 whom 2 , 047 were hospitalised , and 800 died . The pattern of outbreaks followed a similar trend 32 to the epidemic in Australia , defined by two distinct peaks in mid - March and July . Victoria 33 reported the greatest number of outbreaks across all settings aligned with the second wave of 34 infections . Outbreaks most commonly occurred in the workplace / industry setting ( 22 % , 35 190 / 853 ) , followed by education ( 14 % , 122 / 853 ) , residential aged care ( 13 % , 114 / 853 ) and 36 hospitals ( 10 % , 83 / 853 ) . The majority ( 40 % , 340 / 853 ) of outbreaks had 6 to 24 cases , and the 37 median outbreak duration increased in proportion with the number of associated cases . 38 This report summarising COVID - 19 outbreaks in Australia identifies settings of highest 39 risk . Surveillance of outbreaks informs our understanding of transmission dynamics in 40 Australia relative to national and jurisdictional interventions . For settings that are high risk for 41 COVID - 19 , it is important to prioritise planning , surveillance , and implementation of control 42 measures . 43 Introduction 44 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , the virus that causes 45 coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , has spread rapidly around the world since it was first .

Basic reproductive number ( R0 ) estimates for SARS - CoV - 2 47 range from 2 – 4 ; similar to or higher , than for severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza 48 virus [ 2 , 3 ] . Because SARS - CoV - 2 is highly infectious , COVID - 19 outbreaks occur when 49 people come into close contact with cases of COVID - 19 [ 2 , 4 ] . Early reports indicated that 50 SARS - CoV - 2 predominantly spread via respiratory droplets and fomites , emerging literature 51 suggests transmission via aerosols is important [ 2 , 5 ] . 52 Outbreak investigations provide insights into SARS - CoV - 2 transmission dynamics , 53 including the risk in different settings and as an indicator of community transmission . Indoor 54 and enclosed spaces where persons are in close proximity and there is low airflow increase the 55 risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 6 , 7 ] . In these environments , behaviours such as sneezing , 56 coughing , shouting , and singing result in greater volume of droplets suspended for longer 57 periods [ 2 , 8 ] . These environments may result in superspreader events , where one infectious 58 individual infects a large number of secondary cases [ 8 , 9 ] . Superspreader events are difficult 59 to predict and result in epidemic growth that challenge control efforts [ 6 , 10 , 11 ] . 60 In Australia during March 2020 , the first epidemic wave of COVID - 19 was 61 characterised by cases arriving on international cruise ships and by air . This was followed by 62 local transmission in settings where people congregate . Australian state and territory 63 governments instituted extensive non - pharmaceutical interventions , along with case isolation , 64 and tracing and quarantine of contacts . The Communicable Diseases Network Australia 65 ( CDNA ) developed a national surveillance plan that included capturing data on outbreaks [ 12 ] . 66 The Australian Government established COVID - Net , a surveillance network to support 67 jurisdictional investigation of COVID - 19 outbreaks and collect national surveillance data . 68 States and territories have reported outbreaks and clusters of COVID - 19 , with Victoria 69 experiencing a second wave due to community transmission . .

We examine where outbreaks occurred and identify factors 72 associated with transmission . 73 74 Methods 75 COVID - 19 outbreak definition 76 We defined a case of COVID - 19 as a person testing positive to a SARS - CoV - 2 real - 77 time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) assay , and a primary case as 78 the first known case of the outbreak [ 2 ] . If a case in one outbreak became the primary case in 79 a secondary outbreak , the case may have been included in both outbreaks . 80 We defined a COVID - 19 outbreak as two or more cases ( who did not reside in the same 81 household ) among a specific group of people and / or over a specific period of time where illness 82 was associated with a common source of infection . We defined a multi - jurisdictional outbreak 83 as involvement of two or more jurisdictions in the outbreak , regardless of where exposure 84 occurred . 85 Data sources 86 Our report includes outbreak data reported by all jurisdictions to COVID - Net , from 28 87 January until 27 December 2020 inclusive , while New South Wales ( NSW ) reported outbreaks 88 from 5 July 2020 onwards . Local public health units investigated outbreaks and collected data 89 that were reported by COVID - Net epidemiologists using a REDCap ( Research Electronic Data 90 Capture ) database hosted at the Australian Government Department of Health [ 13 ] . 91 Data collected for each outbreak included place of acquisition of the primary case , and 92 number of cases , hospitalisations , and deaths . We categorised outbreaks as one of 13 settings .

The outbreak 94 duration was derived by the number of days between the first and last positive specimen 95 collected in the outbreak , plus 14 days from the last specimen date . 96 We obtained the total number of COVID - 19 cases notified up to 27 December 2020 97 from the National Notifiable Disease System ( NNDSS ) . 98 Data analysis 99 We performed analyses in R 4 . 0 . 0 on a dataset extracted on 28 January 2021 . We used 100 population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Estimated Resident Population ( as at 101 31 June 2020 ) to estimate rates of outbreaks by jurisdiction . 102 We analysed outbreak data by two distinct peaks relative to the 1 June 2020 : from 28 103 January 2020 to 31 May 2020 , and 1 June 2020 to 27 December 2020 . We refer to these two 104 periods as the first wave and second wave , respectively . 105 Ethics 106 Surveillance activities were conducted for and on behalf of the Australian Government 107 Department of Health under the National Health Security Act 2007 . The activities were 108 approved by the Australian National University Human Ethics Committee 109 [ HREC / 17 / ANU / 909 ] . 110 111 Results 112 National overview 113 COVID - Net sites reported 853 outbreaks of COVID - 19 , associated with 13 , 957 114 confirmed cases , of whom 2 , 047 were hospitalised , and 800 died .

As at 27 December , 49 % 116 ( 13 , 957 / 28 , 312 ) of all confirmed COVID - 19 cases notified in Australia , excluding NSW 117 outbreak cases prior to 5 July 2020 , were associated with an outbreak affecting ≥2 persons . 118 The overall rate of COVID - 19 outbreaks during the surveillance period was 3 . 3 119 outbreaks per 100 , 000 population . The highest rates were in Victoria ( 10 . 3 per 100 , 000 120 population ; Table . 1 ) . Victoria reported the largest proportion of outbreaks ( 81 % , 691 / 853 ) 121 and associated cases ( 83 % , 11 , 610 / 13 , 957 ) , followed by NSW , excluding cases prior to 5 July 122 2020 ( 6 % , 54 / 853 outbreaks , 5 % , 642 / 13 , 957 cases ) . Overall , multi - jurisdictional outbreaks 123 had the second highest proportion of cases ( 6 % , 875 / 13 , 957 ) , with a median number of cases 124 of 15 ( range 2 – 331 ; Table 1 ) . 125 Table 1 .

Outbreaks in the first wave peaked in March 135 2020 and subsided by 31 May 2020 , at which time COVID - Net sites reported 133 outbreaks . 136 In the second wave , the source of infection for the primary case was locally acquired in 98 % 137 ( 705 / 720 ) of outbreaks compared to only 50 % ( 67 / 133 ) in the first wave ( odds ratio 47 . 7 , 95 % 138 confidence interval 25 . 8 – 88 . 2 ) , reflecting the impact of international travel restrictions 139 progressively introduced from 15 March 2020 . 140 Fig 1 .

The number of outbreaks reported 154 each week increased exponentially ( Fig 1 ) . The peak in the number of COVID - 19 cases was 155 observed nationally in August 2020 when outbreak numbers had started to decline . 156 Outbreak size and duration 157 The majority ( 40 % , 340 / 853 ) of outbreaks had between 6 and 24 cases , and many ( 32 % , 158 275 / 853 ) were smaller outbreaks of 3 to 5 cases . The median outbreak duration increased 159 proportionally to the number of cases associated with an outbreak ( Table 2 ) . 160 .

Of cases , 296 passengers were reported by COVID - Net ( excluding 165 NSW ) , while 367 NSW passenger cases and 197 crew cases were documented in the Special 166 Commission of Inquiry into the Ruby Princess [ 10 ] . The number of secondary cases among 167 Australian residents who were infected by passengers and crew on board the ship was difficult 168 to ascertain for this outbreak . The largest single jurisdictional outbreak occurred in a residential 169 aged care facility ( RACF ) ( n = 301 ) and lasted for 86 days . 170 Outbreak setting 171 During the two study periods , there were four settings where 60 % ( 509 / 853 ) of COVID - 172 19 outbreaks and 67 % ( 9 , 350 / 13 , 957 ) of outbreak - associated cases occurred ( S1 Appendix ; S2 173 Appendix ) . Workplace / industry settings comprised 22 % ( 190 / 853 ) of outbreaks and 11 % 174 ( 1 , 560 / 13 , 957 ) of cases ( median = 5 , range 2 – 69 ) . These outbreaks most frequently occurred in 175 offices or call centres ( n = 31 ) , unspecified workplaces ( n = 28 ) , and non - food manufacturing 176 ( n = 26 ) . Educational settings comprised 14 % ( 122 / 853 ) of outbreaks and 9 % ( 1 , 189 / 13 , 957 ) 177 of cases ( median = 6 , range 2 – 209 ) . Outbreaks in education settings occurred in secondary 178 schools ( n = 52 ) , primary schools ( n = 31 ) , and combined primary - secondary schools ( n = 18 ) . 179 Outbreaks in RACF comprised 13 % ( 114 / 853 ) of all outbreaks and 38 % ( 5 , 275 / 13 , 957 ) of 180 cases ( median = 11 , range 2 – 301 ) .

Lastly , 10 % ( 83 / 853 ) of outbreaks occurred in 182 hospitals affecting 10 % ( 1 , 326 / 13 , 957 ) of outbreak - associated cases . Among these , outbreaks 183 most frequently occurred in acute care hospitals ( n = 69 ) . 184 In the first wave , 33 % ( 44 / 133 ) of COVID - 19 outbreaks were reported in travel and 185 transport settings , particularly among travel groups ( n = 21 ) and on cruise ships ( n = 14 ) ( Fig 2 ) . 186 Locally acquired cases associated with these outbreaks occurred across the country . Of the 22 187 multi - jurisdictional outbreaks , 9 were associated with an outbreak on a cruise ship . Outbreaks 188 among family and social gatherings ( 27 outbreaks ; median = 8 , range 2 – 45 ) were prominent 189 during the early stages of the epidemic when non - pharmaceutical interventions were not 190 introduced . In the second wave , outbreaks and associated cases were predominantly reported 191 from Victoria and were reported from a variety of settings ( Fig 2 ) . Notably , there was a 192 substantial increase in the number of outbreaks in workplace / industry and educational settings 193 compared to the first wave ( S1 Appendix ) . 194 Fig 2 . Number of COVID - 19 outbreaks , by setting and specimen collection date for the index case 195 per outbreak , Australia , 27 December 2020 196 197 198 199 200 Discussion 201 Australia exerted a high degree of COVID - 19 control early in the pandemic through 202 extensive non - pharmaceutical interventions . Outbreaks alerted health authorities to settings 203 that required specific restrictions , such as international travel and large social gatherings . 204 Outbreak data in the second wave strongly reflects the situation in Victoria . Overall , 81 % 205 ( 691 / 853 ) of outbreaks occurred in Victoria , and resulted in additional important transmission .

SARS - CoV - 2 is easily transmitted on board cruise ships due to high population 211 density , crowded communal and living areas , and shared sanitary facilities [ 15 ] . Initially , 212 infected cruise ships passengers disembarked at a range of ports around Australia—in many 213 instances continuing travel across the country whilst infectious . A coordinated response by 214 state and territory health authorities was required to rapidly detect and investigate COVID - 19 215 cases among passengers of cruise ships where subsequent multi - jurisdictional outbreaks 216 occurred . As at 31 May 2020 , approximately one third of outbreak associated cases and one 217 third of deaths were associated with cruise ships . These figures underestimate the actual 218 number of cases associated with cruise ships due to incomplete reporting of outbreak data to 219 COVID - Net during this period . 220 After initial epidemic control nationally , Victoria experienced a resurgence of COVID - 221 19 from an outbreak associated with a quarantine facility [ 15 ] . Subsequent community 222 transmission introduced SARS - CoV - 2 into high - risk settings such as RACF , disability 223 services , and health care . Outbreaks in education and childcare settings peaked when 224 community transmission was highest during July 2020 , suggesting that infections in these 225 settings were likely driven by community transmission . Children less than 10 years old are 226 thought to transmit SARS - CoV - 2 less than adults and adolescents [ 16 ] . Australian and 227 international evidence indicate transmission of the virus within schools is low and child - to - 228 child transmission within the school setting is uncommon [ 17 - 20 ] . We did observe a high 229 number of outbreaks in kindergarten , childcare and primary schools when compared to 230 secondary educational settings , while outbreaks in secondary schools were generally larger in .

However , there were exceptions to these finding where a single outbreak in primary - 232 secondary school was associated with 209 cases . 233 The high number of outbreaks in the workplace and industry settings during the second 234 wave reflects the staging of lockdown measures . Essential workplaces that were not able to 235 close services or transition workers home such as manufacturers , construction sites , and 236 warehouses were disproportionately affected . Confined and shared spaces associated with a 237 lack of physical distance and poor ventilation are known risk factors for outbreaks in workplace 238 settings [ 21 ] . For example , workers in meat processing factories often socialise outside of 239 work , share transport to work , and work in close proximity in processing lines in poorly 240 ventilated areas [ 22 , 23 ] . Although fewer outbreaks occurred in food industry settings , abattoir 241 and meat processing plant outbreaks were large with a median of 88 cases ( range 5 – 168 ) and 242 22 ( range 3 – 212 ) , respectively . The use of surveillance data to explore the role of 243 superspreader events in settings where environmental conditions are conducive to SARS - CoV - 244 2 transmission is limited . Better understanding of transmission in such workplace setting 245 where infectious individuals work closely with many susceptible individuals , will help control 246 the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 as well as inform public health guidance [ 10 , 11 ] . 247 Transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 among older people in RACF may result in significant 248 morbidity and mortality due to age and a high prevalence of co - morbidities [ 24 ] . Early in the 249 response , the Australian Government released national guidelines for COVID - 19 outbreaks in 250 RACF [ 25 ] . During the peak of the second wave , the number of outbreaks had surged to 88 251 outbreaks associated with 4 , 763 cases . During this time , facilities deployed major public 252 health strategies to reduce the risk of entry and transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 within facilities . 253 Strategies include the development of outbreak management plans , additional infection control 254 training of staff , and restricted visitor entry within facilities . Of RACF outbreaks across both 255 epidemic waves , nearly half ( 46 % , 397 / 853 ) involved 5 cases or less ( Table 2 ) . Nationally , .

This may be due to some facilities experiencing two outbreaks or having gaps of at 258 least 14 days between cases . 259 Limitations 260 These surveillance data are subject to several limitations . Firstly , NSW did not report 261 data to COVID - Net for the entire surveillance period , and therefore the picture of outbreaks in 262 Australia during the first wave is incomplete . Secondly , we cannot comment on outbreak risk 263 by setting in the absence of denominator data . However , these data do provide insight into 264 highly affected settings . Thirdly , there was potential for variation in the classification of where 265 outbreaks occurred , although we attempted to standardise this through use of a common 266 database with standardised definitions . In addition , the development of national guidance for 267 screening and testing of cases and close contacts changed as understanding of SARS - CoV - 2 268 transmission increased . Higher rates of screening of staff and residents in certain high - risk 269 settings such as in hotel quarantine and RACF , inevitably improved outbreak detection in these 270 settings resulting in a bias towards detecting cases and outbreaks . As surveillance data are 271 subject to change due to reconciliation , outbreaks and case data reported in our report may vary 272 from previously published reports . Finally , our definition of an outbreak requires two or more 273 linked cases . States and territories have gradually moved to the presence of a single case in any 274 setting as an outbreak definition [ 4 ] . 275 276 Conclusion 277 During 2020 , Australia experienced fewer cases and outbreaks than many other higher 278 income countries . This was the result of concerted efforts at all levels of society , including .

Our findings demonstrate that multi - jurisdictional 282 outbreaks of COVID - 19 occurred regularly prior to domestic and international border closures 283 and require a rapid and coordinated response . Strong public health policies on physical 284 distancing and hygiene , particularly in high - risk settings , will assist in the prevention of 285 outbreaks across all settings . As the rollout of COVID - 19 vaccines occurs , it is vital outbreak 286 investigation teams prepare to monitor changing transmission within Australia , particularly 287 within closed cohorts of people . Robust outbreak investigations may indicate groups with 288 lower vaccine coverage and will assist with estimating vaccine effectiveness . There are many 289 lessons to learn from Australia’s experiences to prepare for and manage COVID - 19 outbreaks 290 in this period of high epidemic control . Ongoing surveillance and analysis of COVID - 19 291 outbreaks will provide an important indicator in response to evolving policies and response 292 strategies for Australia and other countries . 293 294 Acknowledgements 295 The COVID - Net surveillance network conducted surveillance of outbreaks in 296 partnership with a range of stakeholders , particularly state and territory health departments .
