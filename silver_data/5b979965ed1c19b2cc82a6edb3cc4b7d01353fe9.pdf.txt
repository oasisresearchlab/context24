Many spherical buds are formed via protein binding . As the binding chemical potential increases , the proteins ﬁrst bind to the buds and then to the remainder of the vesicle . For a high spontaneous curvature and / or high bending rigidity of the bound membrane , it is found that a ﬁrst - order transition occurs between a small number of large buds and a large number of small buds . These two states coexist around the transition point . The proposed scheme is simple and easily applicable to many interaction types , so we investivate the eﬀects of inter - protein interactions , the protein - insertion - induced changes in area , the variation of the saddle - splay - modulus , and the area - diﬀerence - elasticity energy . The diﬀerences in the preferred curvatures for curvature sensing and generation are also clariﬁed . I . INTRODUCTION In living cells , biomembranes have various shapes de - pending on their functions . Spherical vesicles , which are involved in endo / exocytosis and vesicle transports , are formed through membrane budding . Many types of pro - tein are known to be involved in such budding [ 1 – 6 ] . For example , clathrins assemble on a membrane and form a spherical bud with ∼ 100 - nm diameter ; the clathrin - coated bud is then pinched oﬀ by dynamin and other proteins [ 5 – 9 ] . To understand the bud formation mechanism , many experiments have been conducted in vitro using giant li - posomes . Buds can be induced by the area diﬀerence elasticity ( ADE ) in single - phase liposomes [ 10 – 14 ] , and by the separation of liquid - ordered and liquid - disordered phases in three - component liposomes [ 15 – 17 ] . More - over , budding induced by polymer anchoring [ 18 ] and binding of proteins such as clathrin [ 19 ] and annex - ins [ 20 ] has been observed . A contrasting mechanism involves Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) superfamily pro - teins , which bend the membrane in one direction along its axis than in the other direction ; thus , their binding generates cylindrical membrane tubes rather than spheri - cal buds [ 1 – 3 , 21 , 22 ] . These curvature - inducing proteins also sense the local membrane curvature and exhibit pre - ferred binding to membranes with their preferred curva - tures . To investigate this curvature sensing , a liposome with a narrow membrane tube pulled by optical tweez - ers and a micropipette [ 23 – 26 ] and diﬀerent sizes of li - posomes [ 27 ] have been employed for various types of proteins . Vesicle shape transformation has been numerically in - vestigated using various types of coarse - grained mem - brane models . Budding has been simulated using dynam - ically triangulated membranes [ 28 – 32 ] , meshless mem - branes [ 33 ] , dissipative particle dynamics [ 34 , 35 ] , phase - ﬁeld models [ 36 ] , and so on . Spontaneous tubule for - mation has been simulated by taking the membrane ∗ noguchi @ issp . u - tokyo . ac . jp anisotropic spontaneous curvature into account [ 33 , 37 – 39 ] . However , in contrast with experiments , the simu - lated vesicle size is limited by the computational costs . In simulations , the vesicle - to - bud size ratio is typically less than 10 , which is far less than that in the experiments on budding induced by protein binding , i . e . , ∼ 100 . In previous theoretical analyses of the budding [ 40 – 43 ] , a single bud in a ﬂat membrane was typically con - sidered ; that is , the remaining vesicle area was regarded as a membrane reservoir . However , to understand the global vesicle shape in thermal equilibrium , the entire vesicle must be considered . This study examines changes in vesicle shape in re - sponse to increased binding chemical potential using a mean - ﬁeld theory . The entire vesicle is treated explicitly using a simpliﬁed geometry . Hence , the binding depen - dence on the membrane properties and various interac - tions between membrane and proteins and between pro - teins are clariﬁed . Protein binding to an arbitrarily shaped vesicle is de - scribed in Sec . II . The budding of a vesicle with a con - stant membrane area is examined in Sec . III , with the eﬀects of the saddle - splay - modulus diﬀerence and inter - protein interactions being presented in Secs . III B 2 and III B 3 , respectively . The eﬀects of the area changes due to the protein insertion and the ADE energy are exam - ined in Secs . IV and V , respectively . Finally , the dis - cussion and summary are presented in Secs . VI and VII , respectively . II . LOCAL PROTEIN BINDING Binding of proteins or other molecules to a membrane is considered , because this binding modiﬁes the mem - brane bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature . First , the case where the membrane area is unchanged by the binding is considered ; that is , the proteins adsorb on the membrane surface , or the hydrophobic segments of the protein inserted into the membrane are so small that the area change is negligible . The free energy F of a vesi - cle consists of the bending energy F cv , binding energy , 2 inter - protein interaction energy , and mixing entropy : F = F cv + Z dA n − µ a p φ + bφ 2 + ( 1 ) k B T a p [ φ ln ( φ ) + ( 1 − φ ) ln ( 1 − φ ) ] o , F cv = 4 π ¯ κ d ( 1 − g ) + Z dA n 2 κ d H 2 ( 1 − φ ) ( 2 ) + 2 κ p ( H − H 0 ) 2 φ + ( ¯ κ p − ¯ κ d ) C 1 C 2 φ o , where A is the membrane area , φ is the local protein den - sity ( φ = 1 at the maximum coverage ) , µ is the chemical potential of the protein binding , k B T is the thermal en - ergy , C 1 and C 2 are the principal curvatures , and H is the mean curvature of each position ( H = ( C 1 + C 2 ) / 2 ) . Here , subscript p indicates the bound - membrane quanti - ties and a p is the area covered by one protein ( the max - imum number of the bound proteins is A / a p ) . The re - maining terms are deﬁned in the below discussion . The membrane is in a ﬂuid phase and F cv is the second - order expansion to the curvature [ 44 , 45 ] . The bare ( protein - unbound ) membrane has bending rigidity κ d with zero spontaneous curvature . The bound pro - teins are considered to be laterally isotropic ( i . e . , they have no preferred bending direction ) ; hence , the bound membrane has a bending rigidity κ p and ﬁnite sponta - neous mean curvature H 0 , which is the half of the spon - taneous curvature C 0 because H 0 = C 0 / 2 . Here , H 0 is used instead of C 0 , because 1 / H 0 is the radius of the spherical membrane to minimize the bending energy of the protein - bound membrane ( the second term in the in - tegral of Eq . ( 2 ) for F cv ) . The ﬁrst term of Eq . ( 2 ) rep - resents the integral over the Gaussian curvature C 1 C 2 with the saddle - splay modulus ¯ κ d ( also called the Gaus - sian modulus ) [ 46 ] of the bare membrane , where g is the genus of the vesicle . This type of bending energy for pro - tein binding has been used in Refs . [ 32 , 47 ] , as well as for a cylindrical membrane with protein rods of anisotropic spontaneous curvature [ 48 ] . In this study , κ d = 20 k B T and ¯ κ d / κ d = − 1 are used as they are typical values of lipid membranes . Since ¯ κ p for the bound membrane is unknown , two cases are con - sidered : ¯ κ p = − κ p and ¯ κ p = ¯ κ d . In the former case , the proteins have the same ratio to the bending rigidity as for the bare membrane . In the latter , the proteins do not change the saddle - splay modulus of the membrane . The former condition is considered in this work , unless otherwise speciﬁed ( the latter condition is examined in Sec . III B 2 ) . The ﬁrst term in the integral of Eq . ( 1 ) represents the protein binding energy . Under higher µ , more proteins bind to the membrane . The last two terms of Eq . ( 1 ) represent the pairwise inter - protein interactions and the mixing entropy of the bound proteins , respectively . Pro - teins have repulsive or attractive interactions at b > 0 and b < 0 , respectively . In the addition of the direct inter - protein interactions , the proteins interact with each FIG . 1 .

Here , we consider only weak curvature - independent interac - tions so that proteins are uniformly distributed in each component . Note that membrane - mediated interactions between soft objects such as proteins can be much weaker than hard objects [ 53 ] . The inter - protein interaction via the spontaneous cur - vature is also considered in this work . If the proteins have large hydrophobic domains above the membrane , as depicted on the right side of Fig . 1 ( a ) , a repulsive interaction yields a positive spontaneous curvature [ 23 ] . Opposite ( negative ) curvature can be induced by an at - 3 tractive interaction . In this study , linear dependence on the protein density is considered as a leading - order ap - proximation ; i . e . , H 0 is replaced by H ′ 0 = H 0 + H 1 φ in Eq . ( 2 ) . The eﬀect of this condition on a constant - area vesicle is discussed in Sec . III B 3 . For the other condi - tions , only constant spontaneous curvature ( H 1 = 0 ) is considered , for simplicity . In thermal equilibrium , the protein density φ is locally determined for the given curvatures . When the inter - protein interactions are negligible ( b = 0 and H 1 = 0 ) , φ is obtained from ∂F / ∂φ | H = 0 for a spherical membrane ( H = C 1 = C 2 ) as a sigmoid function : φ = 1 1 + exp (cid:2) a p k B T ( 2 κ dif H 2 − 4 κ p H 0 H + σ p ) (cid:3) , ( 3 ) where κ dif = κ p − κ d + ( ¯ κ p − ¯ κ d ) / 2 and σ p = − µ / a p + 2 κ p H 20 . For κ dif = 0 and H = 0 , this expression corre - sponds to Eq . ( 5 ) in Ref . [ 54 ] and Eq . ( 4 ) in Ref . [ 47 ] , re - spectively . For a membrane with arbitrary curvature , the ﬁrst energy term in the parentheses in Eq . ( 3 ) is replaced by 2 ( κ p − κ d ) H 2 + ( ¯ κ p − ¯ κ d ) C 1 C 2 . When inter - protein interactions exist , φ is obtained by iteratively solving Eq . ( 3 ) , while adding 2 bφ − 8 κ p ( H − H 0 ) H 1 φ + 6 κ p H 21 φ 2 within the parentheses . For a ﬂat membrane ( H = 0 ) with φ = 0 . 5 ( i . e . , the proteins bind to the half of the membrane area ) , µ = h(cid:0) 2 H 20 + 4 H 0 H 1 + 3 2 H 21 (cid:1) κ p + b i a p . ( 4 ) Figure 2 shows that the protein binding depends on the local membrane curvature . For a high curvature of H 0 or high rigidity of κ p , the density φ changes steeply from 0 to 1 with a small increase in H ( see Figs . 2 ( a ) and ( c ) ) . Here , φ exhibits a maximum at H = ( κ p / κ dif ) H 0 ( given by dφ / dH = 0 ) . This curvature dependence is called curvature sensing . In contrast , the free - energy minimum given by dF / dH = 0 is H = [ κ p φ / ( κ dif φ + κ d ) ] H 0 , be - cause the membrane must bend together . Therefore , the curvature generated by the protein binding is lower than the preferred curvature for the curvature sensing , even for φ = 1 . For a cylindrical membrane , the preferred curva - tures for the curvature sensing and generation are H = [ κ p / ( κ p − κ d ) ] H 0 and H = { κ p φ / [ ( κ p − κ d ) φ + κ d ] } H 0 , respectively . To close this section , two variants of the bending en - ergy for protein binding are discussed . When proteins adhere to the membrane surface , as depicted on the left of Fig . 1 ( a ) , and the membrane composition beneath the proteins is unchanged by the binding , the bending energy can be expressed as F cv = 4 π ¯ κ d ( 1 − g ) + Z dA n 2 κ d H 2 ( 5 ) + [ 2 κ pa ( H − H 0a ) 2 + ¯ κ pa C 1 C 2 ] φ o . This bending energy is identical to Eq . ( 2 ) with κ p = κ pa + κ d , ¯ κ p = ¯ κ pa + ¯ κ d , H 0 = [ κ pa / ( κ pa + κ d ) ] H 0a , and σ p = − µ / a p + 2 κ pa H 20a . κ pa is the bending rigid - ity of protein itself , while κ p is the rigidity including the membrane beneath the protein . For a spherical mem - brane , the preferred curvatures for the curvature sens - ing and generation are H = [ κ pa / ( κ pa + ¯ κ pa / 2 ) ] H 0a and H = { κ pa φ / [ ( κ pa + ¯ κ pa / 2 ) φ + κ d ] } H 0a , respectively . This type of F cv with ¯ κ pa = 0 was used in Refs . [ 25 , 26 , 43 ] . In some previous studies [ 24 , 54 – 57 ] , the binding - induced modiﬁcation of the bending rigidity was not ac - counted for , and the following bending energy was used : F cv = Z dA n 2 κ d ( H − φH 0 ) 2 o . ( 6 ) This corresponds to the condition of κ p = κ d , ¯ κ p = ¯ κ d , b = 2 κ d H 20 , and σ p = − µ / a p in the present model . The preferred curvatures for the curvature sensing and gen - eration are H = ∞ and H = φH 0 , respectively . In their model , neighboring proteins interact via the bending en - ergy through b = 2 κ d H 2 0 . Thus , this term has often been neglected [ 58 , 59 ] . Since the linear and quadratic terms of φ represent membrane - protein and inter - protein inter - actions , respectively , they should be separately treated . As discussed above , the present model is generic and in - volves these two bending - energy models as the speciﬁc parameter sets . III . BUDDED VESICLE WITH CONSTANT AREA A . Free energy We investigate budding of a vesicle induced by pro - tein binding in thermal equilibrium . The vesicle has a spherical topology ( g = 0 ) with no pores . For this theo - retical analysis , the vesicle is assumed to form n bud buds , each with radius R bud . The remainder of the vesicle is assumed to form a spherical shape with a radius of R L , as depicted in Fig . 1 ( b ) , with R L > R bud . The proteins have a positive spontaneous curvature ( H 0 > 0 ) such that they bind to the buds more than the remaining vesicle . In the absence of the proteins , the vesicle forms a prolate shape , which is approximated as shown in Fig . 1 ( c ) . In this section , we consider that the membrane main - tains a constant surface area , i . e . , the protein binding does not change the membrane area ( corresponding to the left protein in Fig . 1 ( a ) ) . The protein densities at the large spherical component of the vesicle and at the buds are φ L and φ bud , respectively . The proteins are as - sumed to be homogeneously distributed in each region . The total membrane area A = 4 πR 20 is kept constant ; thus , the total bud area is given by A bud 4 π = n bud R bud 2 = R 20 ( 1 − r 2 ) , ( 7 ) where r = R L / R 0 . The volume V of the vesicle is ﬁxed : V = 4 π 3 (cid:0) R 3L + n bud R bud3 (cid:1) . ( 8 ) 4 Using Eqs . ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) , the bud curvature can be ex - pressed as R 0 R bud = 1 − r 2 V ∗ − r 3 , ( 9 ) where V ∗ = V / ( 4 πR 30 / 3 ) is the reduced volume . The free energy F of the vesicle is given by F = F L + F bud , ( 10 ) F L 4 π = ¯ κ d + 2 ( κ dif φ L + κ d ) − 4 κ p H 0 R 0 rφ L ( 11 ) + R 2 0 r 2 ( σ p φ L + bφ 2 L ) + k B T R 20 r 2 a p [ φ L ln ( φ L ) + ( 1 − φ L ) ln ( 1 − φ L ) ] , F bud 4 π = n bud n 2 [ ( κ p − κ d ) φ bud ( 12 ) + ( ¯ κ p − ¯ κ d ) ( φ bud − s neck φ L ) + κ d ] − 4 κ p H 0 R bud φ bud + R bud 2 ( σ p φ bud + bφ 2 bud ) + k B T R bud2 a p [ φ bud ln ( φ bud ) + ( 1 − φ bud ) ln ( 1 − φ bud ) ] o = ( 1 − r 2 ) n 2 [ ( κ p − κ d ) φ bud ( 13 ) + ( ¯ κ p − ¯ κ d ) ( φ bud − s neck φ L ) + κ d ] (cid:20) 1 − r 2 V ∗ − r 3 (cid:21) 2 − 4 κ p H 0 R 0 φ bud 1 − r 2 V ∗ − r 3 + R 20 ( σ p φ bud + bφ 2bud ) + k B T R 20 a p [ φ bud ln ( φ bud ) + ( 1 − φ bud ) ln ( 1 − φ bud ) ] o , where F L and F bud are the free energies for the large spherical region and buds , respectively . In Eq . ( 13 ) , n bud is treated as a real number . This is a reasonable assump - tion for n bud ≫ 1 . For n bud < 10 , we treated n bud as an integer , so that r is geometrically determined for each n bud , and F bud is calculated using Eq . ( 12 ) . The neck region connecting a bud and the main spher - ical component ( or connecting buds ) has a saddle shape , with H ≃ 0 . Since these necks have low curvature and small area , the inﬂuence of the integral of the mean cur - vature is negligible . However , it is necessary to examine the Gaussian curvature . The second term of Eq . ( 12 ) rep - resents the integral of the Gaussian curvature of the bud and neck regions , where s neck φ L is the protein density of the neck region . At s neck = 1 , the necks have the same protein density as the main spherical component . This is reasonable because both regions have H ≃ 0 . However , the necks have high principal curvatures ( ∼ ± 0 . 1 nm − 1 ) , which likely prevent large proteins from binding to them , that is , s neck = 0 . In general , s neck ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] . Here , s neck = 0 is used , unless otherwise speciﬁed . The neck exerts a very small inﬂuence , as discussed in Sec . III B 2 . The free energy F is a function of three variables r , φ L , and φ bud . In the case of no inter - protein in - teractions ( b = 0 and H 1 = 0 ) , F is expressed as a function of one variable , i . e . , r , using Eq . ( 3 ) . Hence , the free - energy minimum is numerically determined by dF / dr = ∂F / ∂r = 0 ( Note that ∂F / ∂φ = 0 for φ satis - fying Eq . ( 3 ) ) . When the inter - protein interactions exist , Eq . ( 3 ) is iteratively solved . In this study , the itera - tions were repeated until the diﬀerence in φ was less than 10 − 8 . Typically , fewer than 10 iterations were performed at b 6 = 0 and H 1 R 0 . 100 . The surface tension σ d and the osmotic pressure Π can be imposed as a Lagrange multiplier to maintain the area and volume , respectively : ˘ F = F L + F bud + σ d A − Π V . Then , σ d and Π are determined from ∂ ˘ F / ∂R L | R bud , n bud = 0 and ∂ ˘ F / ∂R bud | R L , n bud = 0 : Π = 1 R L − R bud n 4 κ p H 0 R L φ bud − R bud φ L R L R bud ( 14 ) + 2 σ p ( φ L − φ bud ) + 2 b ( φ L 2 − φ bud2 ) + 2 k B T a p (cid:2) φ L ln ( φ L ) − ( 1 − φ L ) ln ( 1 − φ L ) − φ bud ln ( φ bud ) + ( 1 − φ bud ) ln ( 1 − φ bud ) (cid:3)o , σ d = Π R L 2 + 2 κ p H 0 φ L R L − σ p φ L − bφ L2 ( 15 ) − k B T a p [ φ L ln ( φ L ) + ( 1 − φ L ) ln ( 1 − φ L ) ] = Π R bud 2 + 2 κ p H 0 φ bud R bud − σ p φ bud − bφ bud2 ( 16 ) − k B T a p [ φ bud ln ( φ bud ) + ( 1 − φ bud ) ln ( 1 − φ bud ) ] . The ﬁrst terms of Eqs . ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) represent the Laplace tension . A prolate vesicle is modeled with a simple geometry us - ing a combination of one cylinder and two hemispheres , as shown in Fig . 1 ( c ) . The surface area and volume of the vesicle are A = 4 πR 2pro + 2 πR pro L pro and V = ( 4 π / 3 ) R 3pro + πR 2pro L pro , respectively ; thus , the reduced volume is V ∗ = ( 1 + 3 L pro / 4 R pro ) / ( 1 + L pro / 2 R pro ) 3 / 2 .

The dashed lines represent the metastable and free - energy - barrier states . where φ cy and φ sp are the protein densities in the cylin - drical and spherical regions , respectively . The expression well approximates the energy of the prolate vesicle . We determine the thermal equilibrium state ( i . e . , the lowest free energy F ) by comparing F of budded vesicles and prolate . In this study , we consider the vesicle at V ∗ > 1 / √ 2 ≈ 0 . 707 , in which a vesicle with one bud can exist ( R bud = R L at V ∗ = 1 / √ 2 ) . In this range , the prolate vesicle is the most stable state in the absence of the protein . We use a p = 100 nm 2 and R 0 = 10 µ m for the area of pro - teins and the radius of giant liposomes , unless otherwise speciﬁed , i . e . , a p / R 20 = 10 − 6 . B . Results 1 .

From top to bottom , µ / k B T = − 1 . 7 , − 1 . 5 , and − 1 . 3 . The inset in ( b ) shows an enlarged plot at small R min / R bud , in which circles represent F at integer n bud . The free energy minimum is obtained at R min / R bud = 0 . 0279 ( n bud = 3 ) , R min / R bud = 0 . 891 ( n bud = 2737 ) , and R min / R bud = 0 . 919 ( n bud = 2908 ) for µ / k B T = − 1 . 7 , − 1 . 5 , and − 1 . 3 , respectively . creases , φ bud increases , and subsequently , φ L increases , as shown in Fig . 3 . At low H 0 , φ bud continuously changes from 0 to 1 ( see Fig . 3 ( c ) ) . In contrast , at high H 0 , φ bud exhibits a ﬁrst - order transition . As the double min - ima of the free energy are shown in Fig . 4 ( a ) , metastable states exist around the transition point ( see also van der Waals loop depicted by the dashed lines in Figs . 3 ( a ) and ( b ) ) . On the other hand , φ L always exhibits a con - tinuous change . Accompanied by the discrete change in φ bud , n bud and R bud also discretely change , as shown in Figs . 4 ( b ) and 5 . Hence , around the transition point , the vesicles of small φ bud for buds with large R bud co - exist with those having large φ bud with small R bud . At large µ , R bud reaches the radius of curvature for the cur - vature generation R min at φ bud = 1 . Therefore , with increasing H 0 , the radius decreases as R bud ∼ 1 / H 0 , and 6 0 1e + 07 - 4 0 4 Π R 03 / k B T µ / k B T ( d ) H 0 R 0 = 200 150 100 0 1e + 07 σ d R 02 / k B T ( c ) H 0 R 0 = 200 150 100 0 0 . 5 1 R m i n / R bud ( b ) H 0 R 0 = 200 150 100 0 5000 n bud ( a ) H 0 R 0 = 200 150 100 FIG . 5 .

The curvature radius of the minimum bud curvature energy is R min = ( κ dif + κ d ) / κ p H 0 at φ bud = 1 . the bud number increases as n bud ∼ H 20 . The free en - ergy barrier between a small number of buds and many buds can be very high : ∆ F ≃ 10 5 k d and 5 × 10 5 k d for H 0 R 0 = 150 and 200 , respectively , at κ p / κ d = 3 and V ∗ = 0 . 9 ( see Fig . 4 for H 0 R 0 = 150 ) . Although a free energy barrier can exist for the single - bud formation de - pending on conditions [ 40 – 43 , 60 ] , this is much greater than the single - bud barrier , since more than 1000 buds are formed . Thus , the metastable states presented in this study can remain even on much longer time scales than the single - bud formation period .

The vesicle ruptures when σ d over - comes the lysis tension . This threshold is typically 1 – 25 mN / m , depending on the membrane composition and conditions [ 61 – 63 ] . Since σ d = 10 7 k B T / R 20 corresponds to 0 . 4 mN / m , the lipid membranes are not yet ruptured in the range shown in Fig . 5 ( c ) . However , protein binding ( for transmembrane proteins in particular ) may reduce the lysis tension and induce rupturing at a lower tension . The dependences on H 0 and κ p / κ d are clearly captured by the phase diagrams shown in Fig . 6 . With increasing H 0 , the middle points φ bud = 0 . 5 and φ L = 0 . 5 shift to smaller and larger values , respectively . At H 0 R 0 & 120 , the ﬁrst - order transition appears for κ p / κ d = 3 ( see Fig . 6 ( a ) ) . With further increases in H 0 , the coexistence region widens .

For H 0 R 0 ≫ 1 , the large spherical component of the vesi - cle can be approximated as a ﬂat membrane ; thus , µ for φ L = 0 . 5 is well represented by Eq . ( 4 ) for H = 0 ( see the overlay of dashed lines and solid gray lines in Fig . 6 ) .

( 3 ) ; thus , the deviation is proportional to κ p and H 0 and is less than 0 . 1 in Fig . 6 . Moreover , the sigmoidal shapes of φ L shown in Fig . 3 are well represented by φ L = 1 1 + exp ( − µ − µ half k B T ) . ( 18 ) The deviation from Eq . ( 18 ) is less than 10 − 5 for the data shown in Fig . 3 . In contrast , the shape of φ bud can be largely modiﬁed . Figure 7 shows the dependence on the reduced volume V ∗ . For smaller V ∗ , n bud increases to hold the excess area , although no other notable diﬀerences are obtained for the vesicles with many buds . The chemical potential µ necessary for the transition to form many buds remains unchanged ( see the dashed line in Fig . 7 ( b ) ) . In contrast , µ required for the transition between the prolate to a single bud increases with increasing V ∗ ( see the lower two solid lines in Fig . 7 ( b ) and the inset of Fig . 7 ( a ) ) . For H 0 R 0 = 200 , the prolate vesicle transforms into many buds without forming a small number of buds , so that µ for the transition is independent of V ∗ ( see the upper solid line in Fig . 7 ( b ) ) . Figure 8 shows the dependence of φ bud on the area ra - tio a p / R 20 . The maximum number of bound proteins is 4 πR 20 / a p . For smaller a p ( or a larger vesicle ) , buds de - velop more gently with increasing µ , since more proteins bind to the vesicle and generate greater mixing entropy . In contrast , φ L is shifted to 2 κ p H 20 a p , and the sigmoid function of µ is maintained ( data not shown ) . Finally , we examine the validity of the chosen vesi - cle shapes . First , the formation of a spherical bud on a prolate vesicle is considered . We calculated the free energy of a prolate vesicle with a single bud for the conditions used in Fig . 7 and conﬁrmed the energy is always higher than the spherical vesicle with a single 8 0 . 001 0 . 01 - 4 0 4 | ∆ φ L | µ / k B T ( d ) H 0 R 0 = 100 150 200 0 . 0001 0 . 001 0 . 01 0 . 1 | ∆ φ bud | ( c ) H 0 R 0 = 100 150 200 0 . 4 0 . 6 - 1 . 8 - 1 . 7 φ bud µ / k B T ( a ) s neck = 0 1 0 0 . 2 - 1 . 1 - 1 - 0 . 9 φ bud µ / k B T ( b ) s neck = 0 1 FIG . 10 .

Here , Eq . ( 13 ) is used even for n bud < 10 . bud or many buds . Next , two sizes of the buds are al - lowed at H 0 R 0 = 150 ( the other condition is the same in Figs . 3 – 5 ) . At the ﬁrst - order transition point , the large buds of R min / R bud = 0 . 0365 and n bud = 5 and the small buds of R min / R bud = 0 . 891 and n bud = 2733 coexist . This large size of buds with a number of 2 , 3 , or 4 and many small buds are prepared as initial states , and then we performed the energy minimization for − 1 . 8 ≤ µ / k B T ≤ − 1 . 2 . These two bud radii relax into the same value ( the small or large sizes depending on the relaxation method and condition ) . Thus , the assumption that the buds have the same radius is reasonable . - 4 0 4 8 φ µ / k B T ( b ) φ bud φ L H 1 R 0 = 100 0 0 100 0 . 5 1 0 φ ( a ) φ bud φ L - 1 2 2 - 1 b a p / k B T = 0 . 5 1 0 FIG . 11 .

The solid lines represent thermal equilibrium states . The two left and two right lines correspond to φ bud and φ L , respectively . The dashed lines represent metastable and free - energy - barrier states . 2 . Gaussian curvature In this subsection , we examine the eﬀects of the quan - tities related to the integral of the Gaussian curvature . First , the eﬀects of the modulation of the saddle - splay modulus ¯ κ are discussed . When the protein does not modify ¯ κ ( ¯ κ p = ¯ κ d ) , the coexistence region is reduced at µ < 0 and begins at higher H 0 , as shown in Fig . 9 . Note that the phase diagrams shown in Fig . 6 can represent the data for ¯ κ p = ¯ κ d through rescaling with κ ′ p = ( κ p + κ d ) / 2 , H ′ 0 = ( κ p / κ ′ p ) H 0 , and µ ′ = µ + 2 κ p H 20 a p ( κ p / κ ′ p − 1 ) . Thus , the phase behavior is qualitatively unchanged by the choice of the ¯ κ dependence . Next , the dependence on protein binding in the bud - neck region is considered . When the necks have the same protein density as the large spherical component ( s neck = 1 ) , the boundary of the coexistence region slightly shifts to the right , as shown in Figs . 10 ( a ) – ( c ) , and φ L slightly decreases around the inﬂection point ( φ L = 0 . 5 ) , as shown in Fig . 10 ( d ) . Therefore , the eﬀects of s neck are so small as to be negligible . 3 . Eﬀects of inter - protein interactions Next , we consider the inter - protein interactions . When b is negative or positive , protein binding is more or less promoted at large φ , such that the coexistence region widens or shrinks , respectively ( see Figs . 11 ( a ) and 12 ) . 9 - 2 0 2 - 1 0 1 2 µ / k B T b a p / k B T ( b ) φ L = 0 . 5 φ bud = 0 . 5 coexist - 4 0 4 µ / k B T ( a ) φ L = 0 . 5 coexist FIG . 12 .

The green , red , and blue lines represent the data for α = 0 , 0 . 2 , and 0 . 4 , respectively . The dashed lines in ( a ) represent metastable states . Note that the membrane can be separated into regions with large and small φ within the buds or the main spher - ical component at b < − 2 k B T / a p , in which F L and F bud can have double minima . However , because a homoge - neous distribution is assumed for each component , such a phase - separation condition is not considered in this study . For a nonzero value of H 1 , the spontaneous curvature increases from H 0 to H 0 + H 1 as φ increases from 0 to 1 ; thus , the coexistence region can appear with increasing H 1 ( see Figs . 11 ( b ) and 13 ) . The chemical potential µ for φ L = 0 . 5 continues to satisfy Eq . ( 4 ) , as shown in Figs . 12 and 13 . However , the sigmoidal shape of φ L is modiﬁed , because b and H 1 have greater inﬂuence at larger φ ( see Fig . 11 ) . There - fore , when a signiﬁcant deviation of φ L from the sigmoid function of Eq . ( 18 ) is observed , the inter - protein inter - actions should be considered . 10 IV . AREA CHANGE DUE TO PROTEIN INSERTION In this section , the changes in the membrane area induced by protein binding are considered . When the proteins have a transmembrane domain , as depicted on the right side of Fig . 1 ( a ) , the membrane area is in - creased by the protein insertion . Here , the area ratio of the transmembrane domain α ∈ [ 0 , 0 . 6 ] is considered . Generally , lipid molecules are required to stabilize the membrane proteins , such that lipids remain between the proteins even under the most densely packed conditions . Although the vesicle area is changed by this behavior , the lipid membrane area remains at the initial value of A lp = 4 πR 20 . Thus , R 20 = R 2L ( 1 − αφ L ) + A bud 4 π ( 1 − αφ bud ) . ( 19 ) The vesicle volume is also ﬁxed . Hence , Eqs . ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) are modiﬁed as A bud 4 π = R 20 [ 1 − r 2 ( 1 − αφ L ) ] 1 − αφ bud , ( 20 ) R 0 R bud = 1 − r 2 ( 1 − αφ L ) ( 1 − αφ bud ) ( V ∗ int − r 3 ) , ( 21 ) where V ∗ int is the reduced volume of the initial vesicle ( no protein binding ) . The free energy is given by F L 4 π = ¯ κ d + 2 ( κ dif φ L + κ d ) − 4 κ p H 0 R 0 rφ L ( 22 ) + R 20 r 2 ( σ p φ L + bφ 2L ) + ( 1 − αφ L ) k B T R 20 r 2 ( 1 − α ) a p [ φ L ln ( φ L ) + ( 1 − φ L ) ln ( 1 − φ L ) ] , F bud 4 π = n bud n 2 ( κ dif φ bud + κ d ) − 4 κ p H 0 R bud φ bud + R bud2 ( σ p φ bud + bφ 2bud ) + ( 1 − αφ bud ) k B T R bud2 ( 1 − α ) a p [ φ bud ln ( φ bud ) + ( 1 − φ bud ) ln ( 1 − φ bud ) ] o ( 23 ) = 2 ( κ dif φ bud + κ d ) [ 1 − r 2 ( 1 − αφ L ) ] 3 ( 1 − αφ bud ) 3 ( V ∗ − r 3 ) 2 − 4 κ p H 0 R 0 φ bud [ 1 − r 2 ( 1 − αφ L ) ] 2 ( 1 − αφ bud ) 2 ( V ∗ − r 3 ) + R 20 [ 1 − r 2 ( 1 − αφ L ) ] 1 − αφ bud ( σ p φ bud + bφ 2bud ) + [ 1 − r 2 ( 1 − αφ L ) ] k B T R 20 ( 1 − α ) a p [ φ bud ln ( φ bud ) + ( 1 − φ bud ) ln ( 1 − φ bud ) ] . ( 24 ) The coeﬃcients of the entropy terms are modiﬁed by the factors ( 1 − αφ L ) / ( 1 − α ) and ( 1 − αφ bud ) / ( 1 − α ) to count the number of binding sites under the area change . - 1 0 1 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 µ / k B T α ( b ) φ bud = 0 . 5 φ L = 0 . 5 - 2 0 2 µ / k B T ( a ) φ L = 0 . 5 φ bud = 0 . 5 coexist FIG . 15 .

Two states with a small and large number of buds coexist in the region between the two solid lines . The upper and lower dashed lines represent the states with φ L = 0 . 5 and φ bud = 0 . 5 , respectively . Figures 14 and 15 show the dependences of various properties on α . With increasing α , the coexistence re - gion shrinks ( see Figs . 14 ( a ) and 15 ) . Further , V ∗ de - creases with increasing φ L at α > 0 , since the surface area is increased by the protein insertion ( see Fig . 14 ( c ) ) . Ac - cordingly , the sigmoidal shape of φ L is slightly modiﬁed ( see Fig . 14 ( b ) ) . V . EFFECTS OF AREA - DIFFERENCE ELASTICITY In this section , the eﬀects of the area - diﬀerence elastic - ity ( ADE ) energy on the vesicle budding are considered . In lipid membranes , the ﬂip – ﬂop ( traverse motion be - tween monolayers ) of lipids is very slow ; the relaxation time of the phospholipids is several hours to days [ 64 ] . In contrast , amphiphilic molecules with small hydrophilic head groups such as cholesterols and diacylglycerols ex - hibit much faster ﬂip – ﬂop ( less than a minute ) [ 65 – 67 ] . In living cells , proteins transport lipids in addition ; ﬂip - pases or ﬂoppases pump speciﬁc lipids in one direction ( ﬂip or ﬂop , respectively ) using ATP hydrolysis , yielding an asymmetric lipid distribution , whereas scramblases translocate lipids in both directions and relax the bilayer into a thermal - equilibrium lipid distribution [ 65 ] . Thus , the number of lipids in each monolayer can be ﬁxed on time scales of typical in vitro experiments , although it can relax with the addition of cholesterols [ 68 , 69 ] , ultra - long - chain fatty acids [ 70 ] , and scramblases . Hence , area 11 0 0 . 5 1 - 2 - 1 φ bud µ / k B T w / ade w / o ade FIG . 16 . Eﬀects of the ADE energy on φ bud at H 0 R 0 = 150 , κ p / κ d = 3 , V ∗ int = 0 . 9 , and b = H 1 = 0 , The red and blue colors represent the data with and without the ADE energy , respectively . diﬀerence ∆ A 0 = ( N out − N in ) a 0 preferred by lipids can be diﬀerent from the area diﬀerence ∆ A of the vesicle , where N out and N in are the numbers of lipids in the outer and inner monolayers , respectively , and a 0 is the area per lipid . In the ADE model [ 10 , 11 , 71 ] , the energy of this mismatch ∆ A − ∆ A 0 is taken into account by a harmonic potential : F ade = πk ade 2 Ah 2 ( ∆ A − ∆ A 0 ) 2 = k ade 2 ( m − m 0 ) 2 , ( 25 ) with the averaged curvature m = ( 1 / 2 R 0 ) H ( C 1 + C 2 ) dA . For typical lipid membranes , k ade ≃ κ has been re - ported [ 13 ] ( q = πk ade / κ in the notation in Ref . [ 13 ] ) . The area diﬀerences of the budded and prolate vesicles are given by m ves 4 π = r + n bud R bud R 0 , ( 26 ) m pro 4 π = R pro R 0 + L pro 4 R 0 , ( 27 ) respectively . Here , the case of no ﬂip – ﬂop and m 0 = m pro is considered ; that is , the initial prolate vesicle has no ADE penalty . This corresponds to an experimental con - dition on a time scale spanning minutes to a few hours , in the absence of sterols and proteins promoting ﬂip – ﬂop or forming membrane pores . Figures 16 and 17 show the eﬀects of the ADE energy . Here , µ becomes slightly larger to overcome the ADE en - ergy , but the amount is less than k B T . The inﬂuence on φ L is negligibly small ( data not shown ) . Thus , the eﬀects can only be detected if the other parameters are well de - termined . Otherwise , the ADE energy can be neglected . In the above analysis , it is assumed that the bound proteins do not change the preferred area diﬀerence m 0 between the two monolayers . However , some proteins may modify m 0 through the domain insertion into the membrane . When protein binding signiﬁcantly increases m 0 , the buds form at smaller µ and the phase boundaries shown in Fig . 17 are likely shifted downward . - 4 - 2 0 2 4 6 µ / k B T κ p / κ d ( b ) w / ade w / o ade coexist - 2 0 0 100 200 µ / k B T H 0 R 0 ( a ) φ bud = 0 . 5 w / ade w / o ade coexist FIG . 17 .

The upper ( red ) and lower ( blue ) lines represent the data with and without the ADE energy , respectively . VI . DISCUSSION In this section , we discuss the experimental conditions for vesicle budding . Note that µ can be controlled by the buﬀer protein concentration ρ . For a dilute solution , it is given by µ = µ 0 + k B T ln ( ρ ) . Through screening of electrostatic interactions , µ also depends on the ion concentration . Some proteins have large hydrophilic domains that can generate a repulsive interaction between them ( b > 0 ) , and protein - density - dependent spontaneous curvature ( H 1 > 0 ) . The dependence of the spontaneous curvature on the length of the disordered hydrophilic domains has been investigated experimentally [ 27 , 72 ] . The induced spontaneous curvature can be analytically represented using the conformational entropy of the chains [ 73 – 75 ] and the excluded volume [ 57 ] . Although a linear depen - dence on the protein density was considered in this work , it can easily be extended to include a nonlinear depen - dence for a speciﬁc protein . Many proteins have hydrophobic segments to insert the membrane . G - protein - coupled receptors and ion chan - nels have wide transmembrane domains , some of which have been reported to sense and generate membrane cur - vature [ 26 , 76 ] . For these proteins , the area change ( α ) due to protein binding should be considered . However , 12 when the area change is small ( α ≪ 1 ) , it can be ne - glected , because the α dependence is not sensitive . For example , the diameters of α HL are 10 nm and 1 . 2 nm at the head and transmembrane regions , respectively ( α ≃ 0 . 01 ) [ 77 ] . Thus , the α HL binding can be approxi - mated as α = 0 . The area change due to shallow insertion of domains such as amphipathic α - helix is also likely neg - ligible . Some transmembrane proteins require the help of other proteins for membrane insertion . In the exper - iments of such proteins , the total number of proteins is rather ﬁxed in the membrane . To investigate them , the present model can be modiﬁed to control the total num - ber of proteins instead of the chemical potential . Protein assembly can be induced by the inter - protein attraction , as seen in the clathrin binding [ 9 , 19 , 43 , 60 ] . To model this behavior , the line tension of the phase boundary should be incorporated into the model , and a constant protein density is used in the assembled do - mains . Moreover , the bound proteins may exhibit a con - formational change or form a complex of several proteins through membrane – protein interactions , as depicted on the right side of Fig . 1 ( a ) . When diﬀerent binding con - formations coexist in signiﬁcant amounts on the mem - brane in thermal equilibrium , multiple bound states can be considered . The present model is easily extended to this scenario , although many more parameters ( the free - energy parameters for each state ) must be determined . Under some experimental conditions , the buds may be pinched oﬀ and form separated vesicles . Moreover , the membrane rupture may be caused by the high surface tension induced by protein binding . These dynamics can be taken into account by setting a threshold of the sur - face tension or the bud radius , which depends on the membrane composition and proteins . VII . SUMMARY We have studied vesicle budding using mean - ﬁeld the - ory . First , we presented a formula for protein binding with an arbitrary curvature and clariﬁed the preferred curvatures for curvature sensing and generation . The generation curvature is lower than the sensing curvature , because the proteins are required to bend the membrane . Then , we presented the free energy of the budded vesicle , in which the protein binding can modify the spontaneous curvature , bending rigidity , saddle - splay modulus of the membrane . Moreover , inter - protein interactions are in - cluded as direct interaction and protein - density depen - dent spontaneous curvature . Furthermore , the changes in the membrane area due to the protein insertion and ADE energy are taken into account . With increasing binding chemical potential µ , a prolate vesicle transforms into a budded vesicle . Subsequently , the number of buds increases and the bud radius is sat - urated to that for the curvature generation . The surface tension σ d increases linearly to µ after bud formation . Further , when high spontaneous curvature H 0 and / or large bending rigidity κ p are induced by the protein bind - ing , a ﬁrst - order shape transition occurs between a vesi - cle with a small number of large buds and that with a large number of small buds . These two states coexist in a wider µ range for higher H 0 or larger κ p . The attractive interaction between bound proteins and the spontaneous - curvature increase due to the protein contact promote budding and generate a wider coexistence region . In contrast , the area increase due to protein insertion re - duces the coexistence region . When the preferred area diﬀerence between two monolayers is ﬁxed at the initial prolate , the budding requires a slightly larger µ owing to the ADE energy . In this study , we approximated that the budded vesicle consists of spheres . With the help of this simple geome - try , the free - energy minimum could be determined so eas - ily that additional terms could be considered . Hence , the eﬀects of protein – membrane and inter - protein interac - tions were examined . However , the proposed model can be extended to more complicated geometries . Under low σ d , a ﬂat membrane can exhibit a separated / corrugated ( SC ) phase , in which the bound proteins form hexago - nally ordered bowl - shaped domains , even in the absence of direct inter - protein attractive interactions [ 47 ] . Hence , this SC phase may appear on a vesicle before budding or on a vesicle with a few buds . These bowl - shaped domains should be modeled into a simpliﬁed geometry to account for the SC phase . Moreover , the present strategy can be used to exam - ine other types of interactions , as discussed in Sec . VI , and extended to include other geometries . For example , BAR superfamily proteins can induce cylindrical mem - brane tubes from liposomes [ 1 – 3 , 21 , 22 ] . Recently , the formation of a nematic order coupled with the bending energy was investigated for a membrane with ﬁxed shapes using a mean - ﬁeld theory [ 78 ] . The stable shape of these membrane tubes that protrude from a vesicle is an inter - esting problem for further study . As discussed above , the model presented herein is a useful tool for investigating many problems related to vesicle deformation and can be further extended in various directions .
