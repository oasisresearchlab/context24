In order to solve a problem successfully , the problem representation has to be restructured by combining elements of available knowledge in novel and creative ways . It has been suggested that sleep supports the reorganization of memory representations , ultimately aiding problem solving . In this study , we systematically tested the effect of sleep and time on problem solving , using classical insight tasks and magic tricks . Solving these tasks explicitly requires a restructuring of the problem representation and may be accompanied by a subjective feeling of insight . In two sessions , 77 participants had to solve classical insight problems and magic tricks . The two sessions either occurred consecutively or were spaced 3 h apart , with the time in between spent either sleeping or awake . We found that sleep affected neither general solution rates nor the number of solutions accompanied by sudden subjective insight . Our study thus adds to accumulating evidence that sleep does not provide an environment that facilitates the qualitative restructuring of memory representations and enables problem solving . Keywords : information processing , sleep / wake cognition , sleep and memory , problem solving , insight , incubation INTRODUCTION When facing a diﬃcult problem , we often get the advice to “ let it rest” or “ sleep on it . ” Indeed , some studies support the view that a period of incubation can subserve problem solving , and it has recently been suggested that sleep may particularly contribute to this psychological function . It is , however , still a matter of debate under which conditions such beneﬁcial eﬀects occur . When attempting to solve a problem , the individual elements that constitute the task have to be represented in memory and integrated with prior knowledge to arrive at a solution . This process can either be based on analytic reasoning , which leads to a solution in an incremental step - by - step manner , or the solution may emerge as a result of sudden insight ( Bowden and Jung - Beeman , 2003 ; Gilhooly , 2016 ; Llewellyn , 2016 ) . Even though it is diﬃcult to pinpoint the phenomenon of insight and to deﬁne exact criteria of insight tasks ( Chronicle et al . , 2004 ; Helie and Sun , 2010 ) , it seems clear that insight involves a change in the representation of a cognitive concept ( Ohlsson , 1992 ; Kounios and Beeman , 2014 ) . Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 1 February 2018 | Volume 12 | Article 72 fnhum - 12 - 00072 February 22 , 2018 Time : 14 : 48 # 2 Schönauer et al . Sleep and Insight Importantly , insight requires recombining memory and knowledge elements in an innovative , non - obvious fashion by ﬂexibly switching between diﬀerent associations ( Kounios and Beeman , 2014 ) . Öllinger et al . ( 2014 ) propose a multi - stage model of representational change during insight problem solving that divides the process into distinct , but dependent stages . First , diﬀerent solutions are attempted ( 1 ) which lead to consistent failure ( 2 ) . This creates an impasse ( 3 ) . Only by restructuring the problem representation ( 4 ) can insight ( Aha ! ) occur ( 5 ) and a solution ( 6 ) be reached ( Ohlsson , 1992 ; Knoblich et al . , 1999 ) . Accordingly , reaching an impasse increases the likelihood of a later insight experience and subsequent solution of the problem . The better participants could reach the boundaries of their initial solution space , the easier it was for them to overcome them in a second step . When a ﬁrst problem representation is created and no solution can be found within the assumed problem space , the original problem representation has to be modiﬁed by representational change . This change requires relaxing self - imposed constraints on applicable knowledge ( Ohlsson , 1992 ; Knoblich et al . , 1999 ) . Other conceptualizations of insight problem solving follow a similar logic , but emphasize that the problem space is initially kept as small as possible and will only modiﬁed if no satisfactory progress can be made ( Ormerod et al . , 2013 ) . Together , both theories share the view that constraints on applicable knowledge are modiﬁed during insight problem solving . Phenomenologically , solving a complex problem is often accompanied by an Aha ! experience , meaning that the solution arises in an unexpected , sudden manner , is experienced as obviously correct , and elicits a positive emotional response ( Kaplan and Simon , 1990 ; Gick and Lockhart , 1995 ; Bowden et al . , 2005 ; Subramaniam et al . , 2009 ; Topolinski and Reber , 2010 ; Danek et al . , 2014 ; Salvi et al . , 2016 ; Danek and Wiley , 2017 ) . Furthermore , the solution is often preceded by a period of feeling stuck and might therefore be driven by unconscious processing ( Bowden et al . , 2005 ) . Indeed , qualitative and quantitative reviews have come to the conclusion that a period during which a problem is set aside , termed incubation , is beneﬁcial for insight problem solving ( Dodds et al . , 2003 ; Sio and Ormerod , 2009 ) . Many studies investigate insight problem solving with the remote associates test ( RAT ) and observe that a period of incubation improves performance ( Mednick et al . , 1964 ; Dodds et al . , 2002 ; Vul and Pashler , 2007 ) . According to Gilhooly ( 2016 ) , these incubation beneﬁts might be facilitated by automated spreading of activation along associative links , coupled with an active but below - threshold goal representation . In line with this assumption , it has been shown that a prime can spark later insight ( Cai et al . , 2009 ) . Alternatively , activation of neural traces representing unsuccessful solution attempts might decay over a period of incubation , making a relaxation of previous constraints and consequent activation of novel networks more likely ( Öllinger et al . , 2008 ) . In principle , sleep oﬀers a period of brain isolation that could have similar beneﬁts as an incubation period in wakefulness . Additionally , sleep might even aid the restructuring of a problem representation by qualitatively transforming memories ( Stickgold and Walker , 2013 ) . It has been established that sleep has a positive eﬀect on the stabilization of newly acquired memory content , meaning that it helps to preserve stored information ( Gais and Born , 2004 ; Schabus et al . , 2004 ; Diekelmann and Born , 2010 ; Rasch and Born , 2013 ; Schönauer et al . , 2014b ) . The standard model of memory consolidation assumes that by repetitive reactivation of hippocampo - cortical networks during sleep , initially hippocampal - dependent memories become gradually integrated into cortico - cortical networks , which leads to a reorganization of memory representations on the neural level ( Frankland and Bontempi , 2005 ; Takashima et al . , 2006 ; Gais et al . , 2007 ) . Whether and under which circumstances this process also entails a qualitative reorganization of the memories is currently under debate ( Lewis and Durrant , 2011 ; Inostroza and Born , 2013 ; Stickgold and Walker , 2013 ; Ackermann and Rasch , 2014 ; Landmann et al . , 2014 ) . Arguing in favor of this idea are studies that investigate the integration of newly encoded information into existing knowledge networks in lexical integration tasks ( Tamminen and Gaskell , 2013 ) and the formation of false memories for words representing the gist of actually studied word lists , which are induced by sleep ( Payne et al . , 2009 ; Diekelmann et al . , 2011 ) . Additionally , there is ample evidence that sleep can promote the extraction of statistical regularities , for example in probabilistic learning ( Durrant et al . , 2011 ) or in transitive inference tasks ( Ellenbogen et al . , 2007 ) , making access to patterns and rules explicit ( Stickgold and Walker , 2013 ) . It is assumed that repetitive reactivation of overlapping memory representations in sleep helps to extract regularities from multiple memories ( Djonlagic et al . , 2009 ; Lewis and Durrant , 2011 ) . Wagner et al . ( 2004 ) investigated problem solving in a version of the Number Reduction Task that could either be solved analytically or via a hidden short cut rule . Subjects used the short cut during a delayed test more often when they spent the time after the initial confrontation with the task asleep than when they stayed awake , indicating that knowledge of the hidden rules governing the task improved over sleep . Creative problem solving , contrary to memory integration , concept formation , or rule learning , requires the ability to disintegrate existing concepts in order to recombine memory representations in a novel fashion ( Landmann et al . , 2014 ) . So far , a beneﬁcial eﬀect of sleep on this kind of problem solving is still being discussed ( Monaghan et al . , 2015 ; Landmann et al . , 2016 ; Debarnot et al . , 2017 ) and the scarce evidence yields mixed results ( Cai et al . , 2009 ; Sio et al . , 2013 ; Beijamini et al . , 2014 ) . To our knowledge , the study by Beijamini et al . ( 2014 ) is the only one that investigates the eﬀect of sleep on a problem that requires logical reasoning . Most other sleep studies use the RAT , which is described as an insight problem but actually relies more on associative processing than on the restructuring of a problem representation . In the RAT three seemingly unrelated words ( e . g . , ‘dust’ / ‘cereal’ / ‘ﬁsh’ ) are presented and participants are asked to ﬁnd the expression that connects those three words ( ‘bowl’ ) . Apart from a general beneﬁt of incubation , Cai et al . ( 2009 ) found that participants with REM sleep between sessions had higher solution rates in the RAT than participants without Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 2 February 2018 | Volume 12 | Article 72 fnhum - 12 - 00072 February 22 , 2018 Time : 14 : 48 # 3 Schönauer et al . Sleep and Insight REM sleep . In contrast , Landmann et al . ( 2016 ) did not observe a sleep - related improvement in the closely similar Compound Remote Associates Test , but only better memory retention for previously solved items , supporting a primarily stabilizing role of sleep . The goal of the present study was to disentangle eﬀects of incubation and sleep on insight problem solving . Four groups of subjects were confronted with a set of classical problem solving tasks consisting of matchstick - algorithms , the nine - dot problem and the eight - coin problem ( Danek et al . , 2016 ) . Furthermore , participants had to ﬁnd out how several magic tricks worked , a novel insight paradigm ( Danek et al . , 2014 ) . So far , studies on sleep and problem solving have not addressed the nature of the solutions that were reached by the participants ( Walker et al . , 2002 ; Cai et al . , 2009 ; Beijamini et al . , 2014 ; Monaghan et al . , 2015 ; Landmann et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , to be able to separate sudden solutions , which are typical for insight problem solving , from analytical step - by - step problem solving , we also collected qualitative data about the participants’ subjective feeling of sudden insight , and compared qualitative and quantitative performance measures ( Danek and Wiley , 2017 ) . We hypothesized that an incubation period would increase insight experiences and overall solution rates . Similar to awake incubation , sleep keeps the brain from conscious processing but may additionally support the restructuring of underlying problem representations . Therefore , we further expected that incubation during sleep would have a larger eﬀect than incubation during wakefulness . MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants A total of 77 subjects ( 46 females and 31 males , mean age 23 . 8 ± 3 . 4 years [ M ± SD ] ) participated in this experiment in one of four groups . The sample size was based on previous studies ( e . g . , Cai et al . , 2009 ; Sio et al . , 2013 ) , which found signiﬁcant eﬀects with average group sizes of 12 – 15 subjects . All subjects were healthy and reported a regular circadian rhythm with a sleep duration of 6 – 10 h . There were no extreme morning or evening types in the sample , as assessed by the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire ( Roenneberg et al . , 2007 ) . Subjects were selected to report no problems falling asleep in unfamiliar environments as well as being able to sleep during the afternoon . They had no long - distance ﬂights within the 6 weeks preceding the experiment . Starting two nights before the experiment , participants ﬁlled in a sleep log , giving information about their bed time and when they woke up . The two mornings before the experiment , participants were instructed to wake up 1 h earlier than usual . This mild sleep restriction was applied to facilitate falling asleep in an afternoon nap ( Schönauer et al . , 2014b ; Studte et al . , 2015 ) . Sleep recordings from two participants were defective , but online EEG surveillance assured that those participants were able to fall asleep and their data were still included in group - level statistics . Data from nine participants were missing for the magic tricks because of technical problems with the audio recording . Nine participants reported prior knowledge of the nine - dot problem and were excluded from the analysis of the classical insight tasks . Testing Material Magic Tricks In the ﬁrst task , participants were shown 10 short ( 19 . 5 s ± 10 . 5 s [ M ± SD ] ) video clips of magic tricks and instructed to ﬁgure out the rationale behind them ( “Please try to ﬁnd out how the trick works ! ” ) . Tricks were performed by a professional magician and recorded in a standardized setting . Stimulus development and the experimental rationale behind using magic tricks as insight tasks are described in detail elsewhere ( Danek et al . , 2014 ) . Each trick was based on one single technique ( e . g . , misdirection , sleight - of - hand ) and had one speciﬁc eﬀect ( e . g . , disappearance , telekinesis ; see Table 1 ) . Furthermore , the tricks were diﬃcult to see through , with a solution rate of less than 10 % after the ﬁrst presentation ( Danek et al . , 2014 ) . Instructions for the task as well as the video clips were presented on a 23 - inch computer screen . Participants’ answers with their suggested explanation of the magic trick were recorded by the computer . Matchstick Arithmetic Task In matchstick arithmetic tasks ( see Figure 1A ) , participants are presented with incorrect arithmetic equations , with roman numerals and operators depicted as combinations of matchsticks . The correct solution requires moving one single matchstick to correct the equation . The problem employed in this study was taken from a group of previously used matchstick arithmetic tasks ( Öllinger et al . , 2008 ) . In this case “VIII = VI – II” has to be transformed to “VIII – VI = II” by moving one matchstick from the equal sign on top of the minus sign . The task was depicted on a sheet of paper as well as with real matchsticks . Participants moved the matchsticks , but could return to the start conﬁguration at any time . Nine - Dot Problem This classical task ( Scheerer , 1963 ) requires 9 dots in a 3 × 3 grid to be connected with 4 straight lines , without lifting the pen from the paper ( see Figure 1B ) . In the correct solution , the lines extend beyond the boundaries of the grid ( Kershaw and Ohlsson , 2004 ) . Participants were presented with the dots ( each with one centimeter diameter ) depicted on a sheet of paper and drew the lines directly on the sheet . Material was provided for three drawing attempts . Eight - Coin Problem In the eight - coin problem the coins are arranged in two slightly shifted rows of four coins each ( see Figure 1C ) ( Ormerod et al . , 2002 ) . The subject has to ﬁnd a constellation where each coin touches exactly three other coins by moving exactly two coins . The solution consists of two clusters of three coins each with a fourth coin resting on top of each cluster . Eight 20 - cent coins were spread out on a table . Participants were allowed to touch the coins and move them around during the problem solving process . The initial arrangement of the coins was always visible on a sheet of paper , so that they could get back to the start conﬁguration at any time .

General Procedure Experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Psychology at Ludwig - Maximilians - Universität München , and participants gave written informed consent . In a 3 - h daytime sleep vs . wake × incubation vs . no incubation design , four groups of participants worked on the two types of problem solving tasks described above . Subjects were assigned to the groups randomly as they were recruited . It was , however , assured that all groups had a ﬁnal sample size of 19 or 20 subjects . The tasks were presented in a standardized fashion in a soundproof chamber with no experimenter present . Instructions were given exclusively on the computer screen or on paper . Spoken solutions were recorded in the magic tricks task . The classical problem solving tasks were solved by the subject with the material provided ( matchsticks , paper , coins ) and left in the experimental chamber . Accordingly , no interaction between subjects and experimenters was necessary during the problem solving tasks . This was done to prevent Rosenthal eﬀects of experimenter expectancy . This is particularly important in insight tasks , because even subtle and inadvertent hints or diﬀerences in instructions can strongly inﬂuence solution probability . Participants attempted to solve the problems ﬁrst during a short initial encoding phase and then again during a second solution attempt during a longer retesting phase . Two experimental groups were subjected to a 4h - incubation interval spent asleep ( sleep incubation , s _ inc + ) or awake ( wake incubation , w _ inc + ) between initial problem encoding and retest phase . Two control groups spent an interval asleep ( sleep no incubation , s _ inc − ) or awake ( wake no incubation , w _ inc − ) before initial encoding . This ﬁrst solution attempt was then immediately followed by the retest phase ( Figure 2 ) . Three hour sleep periods started 30 min after the s _ inc + group encoded the task . Sleep was followed by a 30 - min wake - up phase before further testing . Sleep was surveilled by EEG recording . Participants in the wake groups stayed in the laboratory under the supervision of the experimenters and were not allowed to sleep or eat . To prevent them from thinking about the problems , they spent the time reading magazines and playing board games with the experimenters . Videos , instructions and FIGURE 1 | Schematic illustration of the three tasks used to investigate the process of insight problem solving .

( C ) Eight - coin problem : Here , the eight coins in the ﬁrst row have to be moved in a way that each coin touches exactly three other coins . experimental timing were implemented in the Matlab toolbox Cogent 2000 . The ﬁrst solution attempt served as a period to encode the problem representations . For the magic tricks , participants were given standardized audiotaped instructions and viewed each of the randomly presented video clips once . After each video , participants were given 30 s to consider a solution . Then they could provide their possible solution by speaking into a microphone . Subsequently , the three classical insight tasks were brought into the room by the experimenter . After reading the instructions , participants had at maximum 1 min per problem to come up with a solution . The problems were always presented in the same order ( matchstick arithmetic , nine - dot problem , eight - coin problem ) . After each magic trick and problem , participants were asked to indicate whether they had already known the solution beforehand . During the second solution attempt , each of the ten magic tricks was shown twice , regardless of whether it had been solved during the initial phase . The procedure was similar to the initial phase : after each magic trick , participants had the possibility to attempt a solution . Classical insight tasks that had been solved during the initial phase were not presented again in the retesting phase . For the remaining problems , participants were given up to 5 min to ﬁnd a solution . After every magic Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 4 February 2018 | Volume 12 | Article 72 fnhum - 12 - 00072 February 22 , 2018 Time : 14 : 48 # 5 Schönauer et al . Sleep and Insight FIGURE 2 | Study design . All subjects stayed in the laboratory from 2 pm to 7 pm . The two experimental groups sleep incubation ( s _ inc + ) and wake incubation ( w _ inc + ) experienced a 3 - h incubation period between initial encoding and retest . Both control groups ( s _ inc - and w _ inc - ) did not experience an incubation period , but the sleep no incubation group ( s _ inc – ) slept for 3 h before encoding and retest . EEG : application of EEG electrodes . trick and problem , participants stated whether the solution came to their minds in a step - wise or in a sudden manner and whether the solution had already appeared during the incubation period . Polysomnography Sleep data was recorded in the sleep lab using electroencephalography ( EEG ) at C3 and C4 electrode positions according to the 10 – 20 system . In addition , bipolar horizontal and vertical electrooculography ( EOG ) and electromyography ( EMG ) of the chin was recorded . Data was sampled at a rate of 250 Hz . Reference and ground electrodes were placed on the nose and on the forehead , respectively . All channels were notch - ﬁltered at 50 Hz . Additionally , EEG channels were ﬁltered between 0 . 5 and 30 Hz , a 10 Hz low pass ﬁlter was applied to the EOG channels and a 25 Hz high pass ﬁlter was applied to the EMG . All recordings were scored oﬄine in 30 s epochs by two independent raters and disagreements were resolved by a third rater according to the standard criteria by Kales and Rechtschaﬀen ( 1968 ) . Statistical Analysis We calculated solution rates by dividing the number of correct answers by the number of previously unknown and unsolved tasks , separately for the magic tricks and the classical insight problems . Solutions for the magic tricks were rated by two independent raters . An answer was counted as correct , when both raters agreed . Following guidelines by Viera and Garrett ( 2005 ) , inter - observer agreement was high ( Cohen’s K initial phase = 0 . 93 ; Cohen’s K retest phase = 0 . 87 ) . Analyses of variances were done in SPSS 21 and were based on ranked dependent variables when the Levene - Test indicated lacking homogeneity of variances . Additionally , we conducted non - parametric X 2 tests when values of the dependent variable were dichotomous . Signiﬁcance was reached at a two - sided level of α = 0 . 05 . All values are given as mean ± standard error of the mean ( M ± SEM ) if not indicated otherwise . RESULTS Magic Tricks None of the participants knew the solution to any of the 10 magic tricks beforehand . Participants solved 2 . 66 ± 0 . 21 magic tricks in the initial phase . Importantly , groups did not diﬀer in their initial performance as shown by a 2 × 2 ANOVA with the factors following incubation ( F 1 , 64 = 0 . 734 , p = 0 . 395 , η 2p = 0 . 011 ) and following state ( sleep / wake : F 1 , 64 = 0 . 479 , p = 0 . 492 , η 2p = 0 . 007 ; interaction : F 1 , 64 = 0 . 194 , p = 0 . 661 , η 2p = 0 . 003 ; Figure 3 ) . In the retest phase , participants solved an additional 1 . 40 ± 0 . 13 tricks . The ANOVA on the rate of additionally solved tricks showed that neither incubation nor sleep led to better performance ( incubation : F 1 , 64 = 0 . 008 , p = 0 . 930 , η 2p < 0 . 001 ; state : F 1 , 64 = 0 . 047 , p = 0 . 829 , η 2p = 0 . 001 ; interaction : F 1 , 64 = 0 . 149 , p = 0 . 701 , η 2p = 0 . 002 ; Table 2 ) . In addition to the quantitative analyses above , we investigated possible qualitative diﬀerences of the problem solving process . Of all correct solutions , 54 ± 6 . 3 % were solved with insight ( as measured by the subjectively reported suddenness in the emergence of the solution ) . When speciﬁcally looking at those tricks that were solved with insight , we saw that a period of incubation numerically , but non - signiﬁcantly aided performance in the retest phase ( incubation : F 1 , 46 = 2 . 305 , p = 0 . 136 , η 2p = 0 . 048 ; state : F 1 , 46 = 0 . 139 , p = 0 . 711 , η 2p = 0 . 003 ; interaction : F 1 , 46 = 0 . 060 , p = 0 . 807 , η 2p = 0 . 001 ; Figure 3 ) . Sleep groups s _ inc + and s _ inc − did not diﬀer in the length of S1 ( t 34 = 0 . 482 , p = 0 . 633 ) , S2 ( t 34 = 0 . 629 , p = 0 . 533 ) , SWS ( t 34 = − 1 . 594 , p = 0 . 120 ) , REM sleep ( t 34 = − 1 . 459 , p = 0 . 154 ) , total sleep time ( TST ; t 34 = − 1 . 409 , p = 0 . 168 ) , or wake ( t 34 = 0 . 065 , p = 0 . 227 ; Table 3 ) . We did not observe any signiﬁcant correlation between the time spent in speciﬁc sleep stages and performance on the magic tricks ( see Table 4 ) . As REM sleep has been suggested to play a speciﬁc role in creative problem solving ( Cai et al . , 2009 ) , we also tested whether participants with REM sleep ( n = 7 ; 20 . 6 ± 4 . 7 % of magic tricks solved ) performed better than did participants without REM sleep ( n = 9 ; 19 . 8 ± 6 . 7 % of magic tricks solved ) .

Classical Problem Solving Tasks The three classical problems have , as expected , diﬀerent levels of diﬃculty : 45 . 5 ± 5 . 7 % of participants could already solve the matchstick algorithms after the initial phase . The nine - dot problem and the eight - coin paradigm had initial solution rates of 6 . 0 ± 2 . 9 % and 8 . 0 ± 3 . 1 % , respectively ( Table 5 ) . We ﬁrst assessed whether the four experimental groups diﬀered with regard to solution rates in the initial phase , during which the problem representation was formed . ANOVA revealed neither a main eﬀect of following state ( F 1 , 73 = 2 . 521 , p = 0 . 117 , η 2p = 0 . 033 ) nor a main eﬀect of following incubation ( F 1 , 73 = 0 . 484 , p = 0 . 489 , η 2p = 0 . 007 ) on solution rates , calculated as the number of solved problems divided by the number of unknown problems . There was also no speciﬁc beneﬁt of spending the following incubation period asleep as shown by a non - signiﬁcant interaction between state and incubation ( F 1 , 73 = 0 . 039 , p = 0 . 845 , η 2p = 0 . 001 ; Figure 4A ) . To answer the question whether incubation or sleep aid creative problem solving , we compared solution rates in the Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 6 February 2018 | Volume 12 | Article 72 fnhum - 12 - 00072 February 22 , 2018 Time : 14 : 48 # 7 Schönauer et al .

Problems that had not yet been solved were presented again , but this time for 5 min instead of one . Again , we neither observed an eﬀect of incubation ( F 1 , 73 = 0 . 131 , p = 0 . 719 , η 2p = 0 . 002 ) nor an eﬀect of state ( F 1 , 73 = 0 . 641 , p = 0 . 426 , η 2p = 0 . 009 ) on the solution rate . Furthermore , we could not observe the expected interaction between both factors ( F 1 , 73 = 0 . 006 , p = 0 . 939 , η 2p < 0 . 001 ; Figure 4B ) . In our study , incubation between two solution attempts therefore does not support problem solving , regardless of whether this time is spent awake or asleep . Individual insight problems diﬀered largely with regard to diﬃculty . In addition to looking at the combined performance measure of all three insight tasks , we used the Chi - squared test to investigate each individual problem separately in three additional exploratory analyses . We found no diﬀerences regarding retest performance between the four groups in the matchstick arithmetic ( X 2 = 2 . 607 , df = 3 , p = 0 . 456 , N = 42 ) , the nine - dot paradigm ( X 2 = 1 . 038 , df = 3 , p = 0 . 792 , N = 64 ) or the eight - coin paradigm ( X 2 = 1 . 947 , df = 3 , p = 0 . 583 , N = 71 ) . We also investigated whether sleep or incubation had an eﬀect on the number of insight experiences . 66 % of the correct matchstick arithmetic tasks , 42 % of the correct nine - dot problems and 47 % of the correct eight - coin problems were achieved with subjectively reported insight . However , there was neither an eﬀect of sleep nor of incubation on the number of insight - related correct solutions ( incubation : F 1 , 47 = 0 . 188 , p = 0 . 667 , η 2p = 0 . 004 ; state : F 1 , 47 = 0 . 217 , p = 0 . 644 , η 2p = 0 . 005 ; interaction : F 1 , 47 = 0 . 011 , p = 0 . 916 ; η 2p < 0 . 001 ; Figure 4C ) . As shown in Table 6 , there were no signiﬁcant correlations between the time spent in diﬀerent sleep stages and the ability to ﬁnd solutions to the tasks or the likelihood to solve a problem with insight . When comparing sleep periods with REM sleep ( 40 . 0 ± 7 . 9 % of classical problems solved ) to sleep without REM sleep ( 35 . 2 ± 10 . 9 % of classical problems solved ) , we also found no diﬀerence in retest performance on the classical tasks ( t 17 = 0 . 362 , p = 0 . 722 ) .

Sleep and Insight DISCUSSION In this study , we tested the eﬀect of incubation and sleep on solving classical insight problems ( Danek et al . , 2016 ) as well as magic tricks ( Danek et al . , 2014 ) . Previous work has not directly tested whether incubation or sleep aﬀect tasks that critically require a restructuring of the problem representation . Using a daytime sleep versus wake design , we aimed at disentangling eﬀects on both quantitative as well as qualitative measures of insight problem solving . We found that neither an incubation period nor sleep aided the solution of classical problems or magic tricks . Regarding incubation , we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant eﬀects on quantitative or qualitative measures of insight problem solving for either of the two tasks . Only numerically , more magic tricks were solved with sudden insight after an incubation period compared to no incubation . Recent meta - analyses report small to medium sized eﬀects for incubation in insight problem solving ( Dodds et al . , 2003 ; Sio and Ormerod , 2009 ; Strick et al . , 2011 ; Gilhooly , 2016 ) . Interestingly , a remarkable number of studies do not , or only partly , report incubation eﬀects ( Segal , 2004 ; Bowden et al . , 2005 ; Vul and Pashler , 2007 ; Weisberg , 2015 ) . This may indicate that certain tasks proﬁt more from incubation than others . In line with this , Gilhooly ( 2016 ) suggests that spreading activation is the main mechanism underlying incubation eﬀects . Indeed , the RAT , which is frequently used to study problem solving ( Mednick et al . , 1964 ; Smith and Blankenship , 1991 ; Dodds et al . , 2002 ; Vul and Pashler , 2007 ; Sio et al . , 2013 ; Landmann et al . , 2016 ) has been linked to spreading activation ( Topolinski and Reber , 2010 ; Kounios and Beeman , 2014 ) . The tasks we use in the present study , however , require diﬀerent resources than ﬁnding remote associates . Here , the unconscious activation of broad semantic networks will not be suﬃcient to facilitate problem solving . Instead , the representation of the problem ( i . e . , the implicit constraints on the solution space in the insight tasks and the limiting presuppositions regarding the magic tricks ) has to be restructured in order to successfully solve the task ( Danek et al . , 2014 , 2016 ; Öllinger et al . , 2014 ) . Our results indicate that incubation alone may not support the restructuring of problem representations . Concerning the role of sleep , it has been suggested that it may support the qualitative restructuring of problem representations that is needed for insight problem solving ( Diekelmann and Born , 2010 ; Stickgold and Walker , 2013 ) . A reactivation of recently encoded material in the hippocampus is assumed to gradually incorporate new material into preexisting cortical mnemonic networks , possibly also forming the basis for a qualitative restructuring of memory representations . It is unclear , whether the reorganization of hippocampal and neocortical memory traces also entails a change in overt behavioral responses ( Orban et al . , 2006 ; Deliens et al . , 2013 ; Durrant et al . , 2013 ; Landmann et al . , 2014 ) . A couple of studies have investigated the eﬀect of sleep on problem solving ability ( Wagner et al . , 2004 ; Cai et al . , 2009 ; Sio et al . , 2013 ; Beijamini et al . , 2014 ; Landmann et al . , 2016 ) . Regarding tasks that require a restructuring of mental representations , evidence for a role of sleep is mixed . Recently , Debarnot et al . ( 2017 ) only partly replicated an eﬀect of sleep on gaining knowledge of a hidden abstract rule in the above mentioned Number Reduction Task ( Wagner et al . , 2004 ) . Using the same design as that study , they found a beneﬁt of sleep in young , but not in older participants . Wagner and colleagues also did not replicate the high solution rates after sleep in another study ( Verleger et al . , 2013 ) . All three studies did not report measures to prevent experimenter expectancy eﬀects . Beijamini et al . ( 2014 ) investigated the eﬀect of sleep on a logical reasoning game that requires restructuring and insight . At the point when subjects did not know how to proceed to a higher level , half of them were allowed to sleep for a nap while the other half stayed awake . The nap signiﬁcantly increased the chance of solving the level on which they had previously been stuck . Unfortunately , performance rates prior to the incubation interval are not shown , which makes interpretation of results more uncertain . On the other hand , there seems to be stronger evidence for a role of sleep in solving associative tasks . Sio et al . ( 2013 ) found in the RAT a beneﬁt of sleep for diﬃcult , but not for easy problems . These diﬃcult problems have weaker direct associations between stimulus and target and require a stronger spread of activation to activate the solution , which is a function that can be supported by sleep ( Stickgold et al . , 1999 ) . Cai et al . ( 2009 ) found that the occurrence of REM sleep increased the chance to ﬁnd remote associates in the RAT , but only if the correct solution had been primed before sleep . Landmann et al . ( 2016 ) did not replicate the ﬁnding by Sio et al . ( 2013 ) , using the similar Compound Remote Associates Test . In their study , a period of sleep did not increase the likelihood of correctly solving previously primed RAT items . All of these ﬁndings point toward a sleep - dependent spread of activation that beneﬁts the strengthening of available solutions , but less toward a restructuring of knowledge during sleep . In the present study , solution rates as well as the subjective quality of the solution in the sense of an Aha ! experience did not show any eﬀect of sleep . Thus , there is a growing body of evidence showing that sleep does not generally promote the restructuring of newly encoded problems in memory . It may support this process only , e . g . , if a spread of associative information or a strengthening of the existing memory representation are suﬃcient to improve performance . Consequently , our results do not reinforce the notion that sleep - inherent reactivation of newly encoded material and the resulting systems memory consolidation aﬀect problem restructuring and the recombination of knowledge elements required for insightful problem solving . Performance rates and ratios between insight and non - insight solutions in our experiment are comparable to published studies testing the same paradigms . Tasks were pre - tested to conﬁrm that participants obtained suﬃcient exposure to solve the presented problems ( Ormerod et al . , 2002 ; Danek et al . , 2014 , 2016 ; Öllinger et al . , 2014 ) . Solution rates in the matchsticks task closely resemble previously reported rates ( Schul et al . , 2008 ; Danek et al . , 2016 ) . Regarding the eight - coin task , an early study by Ormerod et al . ( 2002 ) reports rather low solution rates of below 2 % . In recent studies on the eight - coin task , solution rates between 25 and 40 % are reported , which are similar to the 35 % reported here ( Öllinger et al . , 2013 ; Danek et al . , 2016 ) . While we speciﬁcally chose the tasks in order to induce a mental ﬁxation , the preparation times might have been too short Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 8 February 2018 | Volume 12 | Article 72 fnhum - 12 - 00072 February 22 , 2018 Time : 14 : 48 # 9 Schönauer et al . Sleep and Insight to induce a strong state of impasse . Instead of interrupting the natural problem solving process , future studies should introduce subjective measures to assess the stage of impasse during problem solving more directly , allowing participants to think about possible solutions until they state to have thoroughly exhausted their ideas . Moreover , it has been shown that incubation time positively correlates with incubation eﬀects ( Sio and Ormerod , 2009 ) . Because it has been shown that the length of sleep can impact the observed size of beneﬁcial eﬀects ( Diekelmann et al . , 2012 ; Schönauer et al . , 2014a ) one might argue that our wake and sleep incubation periods were too short for the expected eﬀect to emerge . However , it has been demonstrated that a nap can actually yield comparable eﬀects to a full night of sleep and avoid confounds by circadian rhythm and sleep deprivation of participants ( Mednick et al . , 2003 ; Lahl et al . , 2008 ) . The current study used several diﬀerent problem solving tasks within the same session . It is possible that sleep has only a limited amount of processing capability or that tasks interfered with each other , and that the eﬀect of sleep was therefore diminished or canceled . On the other hand , using a number of diﬀerent remote associate problems in a RAT task or diﬀerent memory tasks does not necessarily abolish the eﬀect of sleep ( Cai et al . , 2009 ; Schönauer et al . , 2015 ) . Rather , we believe that using a number of diﬀerent problems should have increased sensitivity of our test . Another factor that might have aﬀected the inﬂuence of sleep is the mild sleep restriction by 1 h in the night before the experiment . However , we have used a similar procedure in a previous study without impairing eﬀects of sleep on memory consolidation ( Schönauer et al . , 2014b ) , and even the highly sensitive psychomotor vigilance task is unaﬀected by 2 × 2 h of sleep loss ( Banks and Dinges , 2007 ) . With the total sample size of N = 77 , we are able to detect eﬀects above η 2p = 0 . 1 with a statistical power of 80 % and a signiﬁcance level of 5 % in our experimental design . We can therefore assume that based on the present data it is improbable that an eﬀect of a medium size of sleep on insight problem solving exists . This eﬀect size corresponds to what other studies on cognitive functions of sleep have found ( e . g . , Schönauer et al . , 2014b ) . For large eﬀects above η 2p = 0 . 15 , our design had a power of 95 % . η 2 can roughly be interpreted as the percentage of total variance explained by a factor . Analysis of achieved eﬀect sizes η p2 showed that all relevant eﬀects found explained less than 1 % of variance . Eﬀects of that size would require an N > 750 to yield signiﬁcant results with a power of 80 % . For small eﬀects of around 1 % explained variance , achieved statistical power was 14 % . The present experiments therefore cannot exclude the existence of an eﬀect of that size . We tested the eﬀect of incubation and sleep on solving insight tasks that speciﬁcally require a restructuring of the problem representation . During the experiment , we paid careful attention to prevent eﬀects of experimenter expectancy by presenting only standardized written and recorded instructions . Neither sleep nor incubation increased solution rates or the subjective experience of sudden insight . Our study adds to accumulating evidence that sleep does not provide a more suitable environment for problem solving than the wake state . The main function of the reorganization of memory content during sleep might thus lie instead in the extraction of common features of multiple experiences .
