Introduction With the declaration of the COVID - 19 pandemic by the World Health Or - ganization on March 11 , 2020 , many nations began to consider the implications of the spread of this disease within their borders and across the world [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . Whilst waiting for the development of an eﬀective and safe vaccine , governments 5 focused attention on other interventions in an attempt to curb the spread of in - fection . Broadly speaking , these can be split into preventative actions , such as social distancing and stay - at - home mandates , and surveillance actions , such as contact tracing and testing . Nonpharmaceutical interventions include masking , hand - cleaning , sanitizing , and air ﬁltering . The COVID - 19 pandemic provides a 10 rare opportunity to explore the impact of these interventions on a novel infection and thereby link them to early - stage outbreak dynamics . By the end of 2020 , safe and eﬀective vaccines were starting to become avail - able in some countries . The vaccines have been shown to improve outcomes for infected individuals and to reduce risk of infection and onward transmission 15 from vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals [ 4 ] . Under this scenario of vaccine availability , we are able to scrutinize the data to determine the impacts of vac - cination and the eﬀects of delaying the vaccine roll - out beyond the start of 2021 in certain geographical areas . Our interest lies not simply in understanding the data , but in using math - 20 ematical modeling to explore a range of alternative scenarios in which the pre - ventative and surveillance actions are initiated at diﬀerent time points . In doing this , we can gauge the impacts of the actions and provide a systematic frame - 2 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f work for this approach . South Africa had the largest COVID - 19 burden in Africa , with its cumu - 25 lative cases contributing about 36 % of the total in Africa and at a rate three times more than the second - place country [ 3 , 5 ] . Data on COVID - 19 cases , pol - icy changes on management of the disease , and vaccination rates and protocols are readily available in the public domain [ 6 ] . South Africa was also one of the ﬁrst African countries to roll out COVID - 19 vaccination [ 5 ] . Whilst it would be 30 possible to consider infection dynamics across the country , given the restrictions on movement [ 6 ] and the need for individuals to interact in order for infection to spread , we focus on Gauteng , the single most - populous region of South Africa . Gauteng contains several large population centers including the cities of Jo - hannesburg , Ekurhuleni , and Tshwane . Although it is the smallest province in 35 the country , covering less than 2 % of the total land area , Gauteng accounts for more than 25 % of South Africa’s population . This densely populated region has registered 1 , 095 , 360 conﬁrmed cases of COVID - 19 since April 2020 [ 7 ] . We investigate how the various changes in guidelines over time related to closures and social distancing aﬀect the transmission and spread of COVID - 19 , with 40 our model parameterized for Gauteng . Changes in government guidelines and human behavior can lead to a time - varying transmission rate , due to changing contact rates and possibly due to new variants . We formulate a system of ordi - nary diﬀerential equations ( ODEs ) to represent the transmission of COVID - 19 , including contingencies for vaccination . 45 A number of authors have focused their attention on building and analyzing mathematical models to explore the impact of COVID - 19 in Africa . These models provide important context for our work . For instance , they highlight the pandemic disruption caused to HIV treatment programs [ 8 ] and the impact of response strategies [ 9 , 10 ] . More generally , mathematical models and statistical 50 analysis have been used to predict spread and scale of outbreaks at the start of the pandemic [ 11 , 12 ] , to understand the continental heterogeneity in COVID - 19 impact [ 13 ] , and to explore the comparatively low transmission and mortality rates that have been observed across the continent [ 14 ] . 3 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f In the speciﬁc context of South Africa , two studies have been published that 55 investigate the impact of interventions using systems of ODEs . In the ﬁrst , the impact of social distancing on the number of COVID - 19 cases was explored for the period March – May 2020 [ 15 ] ; our modeling study extends the period of con - sideration and increases the model complexity to include additional population compartments to reﬂect more - recent knowledge about infection transmission . 60 The second model [ 16 ] focuses again on the early stages of the outbreak and considers the utility of a vaccination in containing disease . Again , our work builds on this by considering speciﬁc vaccines and implementation no earlier than January 2021 when they became available in some countries ( but not South Africa ) . 65 Based on the multitude of policy shifts during the COVID - 19 outbreak , and our knowledge of how such shifts aﬀect parameter values from [ 17 ] , we planned for speciﬁc parameters to vary based on certain time periods over the course of the pandemic . Speciﬁc time points where values changed correspond to inﬂec - tion points in the data and recorded policy changes . Vaccine distribution was at 70 a very low level during the time period under consideration ; thus the parameters for the model without vaccination were estimated using incident data , with only two parameters changing as time - varying step functions . After estimating our parameters from the data , including appropriate time - varying rates , we present the ﬁt of our simulated model to our data . We then consider various scenarios 75 involving varying transmission and vaccination rates to illustrate the course of the infection if certain behaviors continued . 2 . Understanding the Data Data for this project was obtained from a repository of South Africa COVID - 19 data , maintained by the Data Science for Social Impact research group at 80 the University of Pretoria [ 4 , 18 ] . It consists of weekly cumulative conﬁrmed cases for the province of Gauteng , South Africa and is shown in Figure 1 [ 19 ] . The epidemic curve demonstrates a number of key features : initial exponen - 4 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Figure 1 : Depiction of weekly cumulative conﬁrmed case data for the province of Gauteng , South Africa [ 4 , 18 , 19 ] . Approximate behavior - change dates are highlighted in red . We have labelled the time intervals between changes as T i , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , 5 , as described in the text . tial growth in case numbers due to the novel form of the virus ; reduction in the rate of increase in July 2020 associated with state policy intervention ; and sub - 85 sequent repeated changes in the rate of increase in cases due to periodic changes in policy and intervention which lead to increased rates of infection ( when in - terventions were relaxed ) or reduced rates of infection ( when interventions were tightened ) . We translate the changes in government policy and individual behaviors into 90 our model by assuming that two key model parameters—namely , the infection transmission coeﬃcient and the rate of identifying positive COVID - 19 cases through testing—vary over time . To correctly identify the time - dependent nature of these two parameters , we combined information from two sources—the epidemic curve and the govern - 95 ment guidelines—in the following way . From the data on cumulative cases , we were able to estimate points of inﬂection . These points separate regions in which the epidemic is worsening ( rate of cumulative cases increasing over time ) from the periods in which it is improving ( rate of cumulative cases decreasing over 5 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f time ) . Our hypothesis was that these points of inﬂection should broadly corre - 100 spond to times where government guidelines changed . Clearly there are likely to be time - delays with any implementation , but our choices of time - dependent pa - rameters align well with changes taking place rapidly ( for example , a lockdown will reduce the transmission parameter β ) . Interrogation of government guidelines provided the following timeline of 105 policy changes : 1 . March 30 to July 12 , 2020 : This was a learning and adjustment period . Having declared a national disaster , the government imposed a three - week lockdown where citizens were told to stay at home and only essential services and businesses were able to continue to work at large . No alcohol 110 or cigarette sales were permitted and citizens were not allowed to travel or attend any form of gatherings . Phased relaxation of this lockdown was introduced using a ﬁve - level alert system . By early June 2020 , the country was at alert level 3 , in which alcohol sales were permitted , schools and universities were reopened , and limited air travel was allowed . South 115 Africa recorded its highest number of infections in one day ( 13 , 674 ) within this ﬁrst wave . This prompted some renewed strict restrictions such as bans on alcohol and family visits , and night curfew being restored . 2 . July 13 to October 10 , 2020 : Temporary school closures were announced around July 23 for four weeks . The risk - adjusted alert system level was 120 reduced to 2 in mid - August before further relaxation of restrictions went down to level 1 . Almost all economic activities opened with increased mobility and crowding within and outside households . Towards the end of this period , a new variant , beta , emerged in the coastal regions of South Africa with a transmissibility rate twice that of the original variant , alpha . 125 3 . October 11 to December 27 , 2020 : Diﬀerentiated regional alert levels were used as a reﬁned version of interventions that were less necessary in some areas than others . A surge in cases up to 145 % was observed in some coastal regions ; this was attributed to interactions in educational settings , 6 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f the festive season , and other big events . Spread of infection was seen to oc - 130 cur mainly in the younger age group of 15 – 19 year - olds . Some restrictions were put in place during the festive season to restrict spread . 4 . December 28 , 2020 to March 30 , 2021 : The national alert level 3 prohibited indoor and outdoor gatherings for 14 days from December 28 . Additional restrictions in mid - January until mid - February involved closing land ports 135 of entry . Easing of restrictions to level 3 opened public spaces and eco - nomic activities . By the end of February , the national alert level was at 1 . Vaccination of health care workers began . 5 . March 31 to June 6 , 2021 : Vaccination of health workers continued and began with people of age 60 years or more . The delta variant emerged in 140 Gauteng , which caused the alert response to move from level 1 to level 2 . For details of the alert levels , refer to [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 ] . Combining this information with the points of inﬂection found in the cumu - lative cases data , we estimated the following four dates for behavioral change : July 13 , 2020 , October 12 , 2020 , December 28 , 2020 , and March 30 , 2021 . These 145 dates correspond to the times at which certain parameters change values in our model , resulting in ﬁve time periods which we label T i , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , 5 , as shown in Figure 1 . More details on our process are given in Section 4 . A number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies have developed vaccines for COVID - 19 , each of which diﬀers in the biotechnology used , eﬃcacy , and ge - 150 ographic availability . In South Africa , two commonly available vaccines are those developed by Pﬁzer and Johnson & Johnson . Based on the information presented in [ 4 ] , the Pﬁzer vaccine can be assumed to be 95 % eﬀective at pre - venting individuals from contracting the disease and 95 % eﬀective at preventing symptomatic disease ( vaccinated individuals becoming ill and developing symp - 155 toms ) . The vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson claims to be 64 % eﬀective at preventing disease speciﬁcally in South Africa and 81 % eﬀective at prevent - ing symptomatic disease ( vaccinated individuals becoming ill and developing symptoms ) [ 4 ] . We use these values to choose vaccine - related parameters when 7 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f we consider the implementation of vaccination programs in South Africa . 160 3 . Model Structure Figure 2 : Flow diagram of compartmental model with vaccination . Our full model system comprises nine compartments in a coupled system of nonlinear ODEs . The compartments are taken to represent : S susceptible individuals , V fully vaccinated individuals , E exposed individuals , E V exposed after vaccination individuals , A asymptomatic individuals , I pre - symptomatic 165 and symptomatic infected individuals , Q individuals with conﬁrmed infections , H individuals in the hospital with conﬁrmed infections , and R recovered in - dividuals . We do not consider partial vaccination—consequently , we assume that individuals remain in the unvaccinated class until the vaccine is eﬀective ( typically two weeks after the ﬁnal vaccine dose administered ) . 170 Asymptomatic individuals remain asymptomatic throughout the disease pro - cess , while pre - symptomatic individuals are not presently symptomatic but will later become symptomatic . Note that pre - symptomatic individuals trans - mit the infection at a rate similar to symptomatic individuals , and thus the 8 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f pre - symptomatic and symptomatic individuals are combined in the I class . 175 Asymptomatic individuals transmit the infection at a much lower rate than pre - symptomatic and symptomatic individuals , and this diﬀerence is indicated in the force of infection term which has a larger coeﬃcient c on the I term than the A term . The transitions between compartments are illustrated in Figure 2 . The parameters ( with units ) are described in Table 1 . 180 We assume that the behavior and policy changes discussed in Section 2 altered the transmission rate β at which the disease spreads as well as the testing infrastructure and capacity rate κ . For this reason we allow these two parameters to vary over time using the inﬂection points and the policy mandates identiﬁed in Section 2 . Equations for our compartmental model are given by : 185 dS dt = − ( λ + θ ) S dE dt = λS − αE dA dt = α(cid:15)E + α(cid:15) 1 E V − γ 1 A dI dt = α ( 1 − (cid:15) ) E + α ( 1 − (cid:15) 1 ) E V − ( µ + κ ( t ) + γ 2 ) I dQ dt = κ ( t ) I − ( γ 3 + ρ + µ ) Q dH dt = ρQ − ( µ H + γ 4 ) H dR dt = γ 1 A + γ 2 I + γ 3 Q + γ 4 H dV dt = θS − λ 1 V dE V dt = λ 1 V − αE V ( 1 ) where all model parameters are non - negative and are deﬁned in Table 1 . The force of infection for susceptibles S is given by λ = β ( t ) A + cI S + E + A + I + R + V + E V , and the vaccinated individuals V have a modiﬁed force of infection , λ 1 = ( 1 − π 1 ) λ , 9 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f due to having a reduced chance of becoming exposed ( with 0 < π 1 < 1 ) [ 4 ] . Note that the denominator of the force of infection only includes the compartments that are available to be in contact with the susceptibles S i . e . , we assume that the two compartments Q and H are isolated and are not in contact with the susceptibles . 190 Having split the time frame for our modeling into ﬁve distinct intervals T i , i = 1 , . . . , 5 , the time - dependent parameters β ( t ) and κ ( t ) are assumed to take the form : β i ( t ) = β i , κ i ( t ) = κ i , for t ∈ T i , i = 1 , . . . , 5 . Since an infectious pre - symptomatic or symptomatic individual is more likely to transmit COVID - 19 than an asymptomatic individual , we scale the contact rate with I by a factor of c within the force of infection [ 32 ] . Due to the lack of widespread testing of asymptomatic individuals in this province , we do not include a route for asymptomatic individuals to move into the Q class . We assume that individuals in I , Q , and H compartments could die from a COVID - 19 infection . Individuals in the A , I , Q , and H compartments can recover from the disease . The proportion of E V that become asymptomatic A is larger than without vaccination , [ 4 ] which corresponds to (cid:15) < (cid:15) 1 . As with many modeling problems involving infectious diseases , COVID - 19 is 195 an infection where the value of the basic reproduction number (cid:60) 0 has practical signiﬁcance . It corresponds to the initial outbreak and can be used to see how the infection was growing at that time . Using the Next Generation Matrix Method [ 33 , 34 ] with β and κ held constant at the values estimated in interval T 1 , we calculate the basic reproduction number for this model to be 200 (cid:60) 0 = β(cid:15) γ 1 + cβ ( 1 − (cid:15) ) κ + µ + γ 2 . ( 2 ) We can interpret the two terms as representing the two routes of transmission through the A ( ﬁrst term ) and I ( second term ) compartments .

Using parameter estimates from our time pe - riod T 1 ( see Section 4 below ) , and Equation ( 2 ) we estimate that , for Gauteng Province , at the start of the outbreak 205 (cid:60) 0 = 1 . 68 . Field studies for the same period in Gauteng Province estimate (cid:60) 0 to fall be - tween 1 and 2 . 19 [ 35 ] , which gives us conﬁdence in our parameter estimates . 4 . Parameter Estimation We obtained estimates for many of the model parameters from the litera - ture ; these are given in Table 3 together with their references . The remaining 11 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f parameters were estimated using our data from Gauteng [ 19 ] . To account for inconsistent reporting rates over the course of a given week , we transformed the data that was reported as cumulative conﬁrmed daily cases into weekly data . We estimate unknown parameters by formulating a least - squares optimization problem with the goal of minimizing the diﬀerence between the recorded num - ber of weekly cumulative conﬁrmed cases in Gauteng and our model’s output . The objective function to be minimized is J = (cid:107) WQ − WQ ∗ (cid:107) 2 (cid:107) WQ ∗ (cid:107) 2 , where the vector WQ contains the weekly cumulative number of conﬁrmed infections from the model and the vector WQ ∗ contains the corresponding values 210 from the data . To aid the optimization process we bounded each parameter using informa - tion from [ 36 ] and from the sources listed in Table 2 .

Our parameter estimation simulations begin on March 30 , 2020 and take daily time steps until the date our data ends , which is June 6 , 2021 . Initial 215 values for our simulations include the population of Gauteng for S 0 and the exact value from the data for Q 0 . The initial values of E 0 , A 0 , and I 0 are chosen using the information about the average lengths of time spent in those classes and the asymptomatic infected being about one - third of the total infected [ 32 ] . 12 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f The values of H and R are taken as zero because of the paucity of information 220 linked to the onset of the outbreak . Initial values are summarized below : S 0 E 0 A 0 I 0 Q 0 H 0 R 0 15 , 488 , 137 30 15 30 411 0 0 We solve our least - squares optimization problem in MATLAB version R2021a using the MultiStart and fmincon functions [ 17 , 42 , 43 ] . Given a starting point for our objective function J , the fmincon algorithm outputs a local minimum on the surface of J . To help ﬁnd the global minimum , MultiStart allows us to 225 exhaustively test diﬀerent starting values throughout our bounded range . We used 10 , 000 diﬀerent starting points , each of which converged to a unique local minimum on the surface of J . The smallest objective function value obtained was J = 0 . 01 . To align with what took place in Gauteng , one ﬁnal condition we have on our parameter values is that the resulting simulation must produce two 230 infection peaks , the second of which should be greater than or approximately equal to the ﬁrst . Table 3 depicts the parameter estimates that we obtained either from ﬁtting the model to data or from the literature . The only exception is our estimate for θ which we chose to correspond to a vaccination capacity of around 40 , 000 235 individuals per day [ 44 ] . The estimated mean values of the generation interval , serial interval , incuba - tion period , and latent period have varied geographically and temporally since the beginning of the COVID - 19 outbreak in Hubei , China [ 45 ] . These values af - fect the estimate of (cid:60) 0 and decisions about intervention actions [ 46 , 45 , 47 , 48 ] ; 240 as we indicated earlier , our prediction for (cid:60) 0 falls within the bounds estimated from Gauteng daily reported cases which suggests that we have reasonable pa - rameter estimates for the onset of COVID - 19 in the region . More recent work on the mean generation intervals ( time lag between infections of a primary case and its secondary case ) indicates that the sum of the mean latent period [ 49 ] 245 and mean infectious period may be shorter than predicted earlier in the epi - 13 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f demic [ 50 ] . This would aﬀect our parameters , α and γ 2 , but for the purpose of this work , we ﬁx the value of these parameters using estimates from the initial period of outbreak .

Results 250 In this section , we present results from our numerical exploration of diﬀerent responses to public health policy changes . We consider dynamics both with and without vaccination implementation since vaccines were not readily available in South Africa until June 2021 . Numerical solution of our model system ( 1 ) in the absence of any vaccina - 255 tion intervention using the estimated parameters given in Table 3 is shown in Figure 3 . The ﬁgure indicates that we have established a good model ﬁt to the cumulative cases of COVID - 19 in Gauteng , and so we label this as the baseline 14 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Figure 3 : Simulation output using our estimated parameters is plotted alongside the con - ﬁrmed cumulative case data and exhibits a good ﬁt to the shape of the infection curve . Our values for β and κ change four times at the locations indicated by ∗ ( for further details on these change times , see Section 2 ) .

Also see the two peaks in conﬁrmed cases from this baseline scenario in Figure 4 . 260 In Section 5 . 1 , we explore how diﬀerent responses to the public health in - terventions would have impacted cumulative COVID - 19 cases in the absence of vaccination . In Section 5 . 2 we compare key metrics output from the model for the two vaccines commonly available in South Africa , assuming diﬀerent dates when they became generally available . 265 5 . 1 . Infection Dynamics Without Vaccination Figure 5 shows model predictions against the actual cumulative case data assuming no additional policy or behavior changes at the end of each of the time intervals T i , i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . This means that the parameters in place at the end of a speciﬁc time interval were used for the simulation for the remainder 270 of the entire simulation run , and these are denoted as Scenarios 1 – 4 in Table 4 . When this happened at the end of a time period where case numbers were increasing , our model predictions show large , unsurprising , increases in COVID - 19 infections compared with the actual data . Similarly , at the end of a time interval where restrictions were imposed and had caused lower infection rates , 275 if those behaviors continued into the next time period , we see a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of new cases . We explore these impacts further in Table 4 , to see how the interventions and relaxation of restrictions aﬀected the global maximum number of infected individuals in the population ( calculated as A + I + Q + H ) , the number of cumulative conﬁrmed cases , and how many 280 infected people were hospitalized ( calculated as H ) when that number was at a peak . These results are shown in the Table 4 as Scenarios 1 – 4 , respectively ; our choice of metrics was motivated by the data that has been regularly reported throughout the pandemic as critical for public health decision making . Scenario 1 conﬁrms that if no intervention had taken place at the end of the 285 time period T 1 , then the public health outcome would have been signiﬁcantly worse . The healthcare system would have been overloaded with several hundred thousand patients . In some sense , Scenario 2 is the best - case scenario if the 16 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f public health interventions implemented in period T 2 had been continued at the same level through June 6 , 2021 . Of course , this does not take into consideration 290 any economic or social welfare issues which would certainly have been negatively impacted by the more - extreme interventions . Having said that , this scenario gives an indication of the levels of infection and hospitalization that could have occurred . Scenarios 3 and 4 mimic 1 and 2 but add insight into the size of hospital peaks , in particular , the second one . 295 Scenarios 5 – 8 present a more - theoretical exploration of the model predictions since they take the parameter estimates from each of the time intervals T i , i = 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and assume these hold for the entire period of simulation starting in March 2020 . This idealization would clearly not have been possible ( since it requires retrospective implementation ) , but it highlights the importance of 300 considering the largest possible time interval for parameter estimation to avoid focusing on a single interval which may produce diﬀerent parameter values and infection outcomes . As an example , in Scenario 6 we see that if the parameters estimated for the time interval T 2 were used for the model simulation from the outset , the number of COVID cases and hospitalizations would have been 305 predicted to be signiﬁcantly lower . Meanwhile , for Scenario 8—which has high parameter values from T 5 —the outputs are unrealistically large reﬂecting the possibility of unchecked spread . Whilst there has always been potential to allow model parameters to vary throughout numerical experiments , the explicit public health interventions seen globally for COVID have brought this feature to the 310 fore . 5 . 2 . Impact of Vaccination In this analysis we ignore the diﬀerences in biotechnology used to deliver the dose , cost of implementation , and the number of doses required to become fully vaccinated , and instead focus on the eﬀectiveness of each vaccine . Using the 315 associated parameter estimates for T 5 given in Table 3 , we undertook a series of numerical experiments to explore how delays in rolling out the vaccination program and vaccine eﬃcacy impact the key public health metrics . 17 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Scenario Max Infected ( date ) Cumulative Conﬁrmed Cases Total in Hospital 1st Hospital Peak ( date ) 2nd Hospital Peak ( date ) Baseline simulation using estimated parameters baseline 70 , 322 ( 7 / 16 / 20 ) 474 , 648 257 , 670 16 , 123 ( 7 / 20 / 20 ) 14 , 922 ( 1 / 8 / 21 ) Summarizing simulations in Figure 5 1 1 , 402 , 803 ( 9 / 18 / 20 ) 6 , 906 , 308 3 , 822 , 977 385 , 847 ( 9 / 22 / 20 ) N / A 2 70 , 323 ( 7 / 16 / 20 ) 226 , 514 125 , 276 16 , 123 ( 7 / 19 / 20 ) N / A 3 836 , 901 ( 3 / 18 / 21 ) 2 , 823 , 107 1 , 557 , 400 16 , 123 ( 7 / 20 / 20 ) 1 , 118 , 056 ( 3 / 25 / 21 ) 4 70 , 323 ( 7 / 16 / 20 ) 416 , 728 230 , 551 16 , 123 ( 7 / 20 / 20 ) 14 , 922 ( 1 / 8 / 21 ) Fixing parameters from a given section for duration 5 456 ( 3 / 30 / 20 ) 724 287 N / A N / A 6 937 , 647 ( 10 / 23 / 20 ) 2 , 804 , 247 1 , 552 , 217 125 , 081 ( 10 / 30 / 20 ) N / A 7 456 ( 3 / 30 / 20 ) 750 300 N / A N / A 8 837 , 389 ( 11 / 14 / 20 ) 5 , 302 , 811 2 , 935 , 303 214 , 753 ( 11 / 19 / 20 ) N / A Table 4 : Summary of key information from simulating scenarios . The table column ( Global ) Max Infected also records the date at which the largest number of infected individuals occurs . Row 1 summarizes our baseline simulation as seen in Figure 3 . Scenarios 1 – 4 summarize the simulations shown in Figure 5 , continuing the parameters to the end from the ﬁrst , second , third , and fourth changes . The information found in Scenarios 5 – 8 was obtained by holding parameters from each given group constant for the duration of the simulation . 18 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Figure 5 : This plot simulates what could have taken place if infection dynamics that result from speciﬁc values of β i and κ i had persisted rather than changed to new values . We considered two start dates for vaccination : January 4 , 2021 represents an aspirational date corresponding to the roll out of programs in several countries 320 including the UK and USA ; and June 7 , 2021 which reﬂects a realistic start date for the program of vaccination in South Africa . In both cases , we simulated the model system from March 30 , 2020 to an end date April 4 , 2022 . We present the results of our exploration in Table 5 and note that they appear consistent with an intuitive understanding of what vaccination would 325 achieve . The program reduces COVID numbers and hospitalizations ; the more eﬀective the vaccine , the better it does ; and delays to implementing a vaccination strategy can signiﬁcantly increase the number of infections and subsequently people needing hospital care . Since we are undertaking this exploratory work using parameters from time 330 period T 1 , the levels of infection which we obtain are larger than observed . Moreover , since we are extrapolating our simulation until April 2022 , we are not surprised to see bigger infected levels than for the baseline case . 19 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f V start 1 / 4 / 21 Max Infected Cumulative Conﬁrmed Cases Total in Hospital 3rd H Peak Total V Total E V Pﬁzer 60 , 296 97 , 896 65 , 447 330 10 , 503 , 215 908 J & J 60 , 296 774 , 180 436 , 284 11 , 055 10 , 155 , 676 618 , 777 None 626 , 811 4 , 671 , 953 2 , 597 , 767 160 , 981 0 0 V start 6 / 7 / 21 Max Infected Cumulative Conﬁrmed Cases Total in Hospital 3rd H Peak Total V Total E V Pﬁzer 201 , 280 1 , 653 , 919 920 , 419 51 , 170 6 , 835 , 309 46 , 521 J & J 375 , 935 2 , 960 , 281 1 , 643 , 341 89 , 092 5 , 951 , 945 735 , 231 None 626 , 811 4 , 513 , 906 2 , 503 , 479 160 , 981 0 0 Table 5 : Key metrics from vaccination simulations .

Discussion and conclusion COVID - 19 has provided mathematical modellers with access to detailed data 335 on key infection metrics such as incidence of infection and infection - related deaths , together with data on public health interventions such as hospitalization and vaccination . There are certainly inaccuracies within the data sets , but they represent a rich data source to interrogate . The approach that we have taken here—identifying points of inﬂection in the data—does exactly that , and it led us 340 to identify key dates at which public health interventions caused a change in the cases of COVID - 19 in Gauteng Province , South Africa . This was undoubtedly helped by the daily reporting of COVID - 19 cases and illustrates a methodology which could be used with other infectious disease data sets . The existing published models for COVID - 19 in South Africa focussed on 345 the early stages of the epidemic . Building upon this , we have demonstrated 20 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f the impact of public health interventions and have predicted what would have happened at each stage if those interventions and corresponding rates had con - tinued . In part , we undertook these explorations to support any future public health decisions that may be needed , but also to highlight the impact of the 350 interventions . Our focus on Gauteng Province , rather than all of South Africa , was intentional in this respect . Gauteng is the most - densely populated region in South Africa , and since COVID - 19 infection is spread through close contact , we consider density as a proxy for likelihood of interaction between individuals . Moreover , travel restrictions that were widespread around the globe resulted in 355 unprecedented levels of isolation between large urban areas . This meant that infection transmission between diﬀerent cities in South Africa was likely to be less signiﬁcant than transmission within cities . Once we identiﬁed the distinct time periods T i , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , 5 , we were able to demonstrate the relative impact of the changing parameters by undertaking 360 a series of numerical experiments in which the two time - dependent parameters β i and κ i were ﬁxed to values estimated in one of the time periods . Results from these simulations showed that changes in our estimated parameter values lead to notably diﬀerent infection dynamics and total incidents ( see Figure 5 and Table 4 ) . This analysis indicates that when modeling COVID - 19 one should carefully 365 explore the data to extract all relevant information when estimating parameters . Additionally , since it is unlikely that parameter estimates from a limited time interval should be used to explore an extended period of the epidemic , future researchers should consider whether parameter estimates are realistic for the period of exploration or whether additional data should be sought . 370 Our simulations related to the impact of vaccination was informed by details of the eﬃcacy of the Pﬁzer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines , since these are the vaccines most widely available in South Africa . We also considered the con - sequences of unequal availability of vaccines around the world by assuming two diﬀerent start dates for the vaccination program . The start date of January 4 , 375 2021 was chosen to be consistent with general roll - outs of programs in countries such as the UK , the USA , and some European Union countries and was com - 21 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f pared to a start date of June 7 , 2021 , which aligns with the general availability of vaccines in South Africa . Our projections continue to April 2022 and so exact numbers must be treated with caution . However , the message is clear— 380 vaccination provides an important element in the ﬁght against COVID - 19 , and delay in delivering vaccines has a signiﬁcant negative impact . At the time of this paper’s analysis , the Omicron variant had just emerged , and thus our model involved data and epidemiological properties of earlier vari - ants . In the future , the model structure proposed here could either be modiﬁed 385 to include multiple variants or adapted through parameter values to explore the dynamics of the dominant variant . Despite the dimensionality of our model ( which has nine state variables ) , it is a simple representation of the dynamics of COVID - 19 . That was intentional , to allow us to address the questions we chose to explore ; but it also allows the model to be modiﬁed in the future to 390 address other important processes . For example , one could consider reinfection or wanning immunity from vaccination if the model covers a longer time period . Also one could include mobility data to better represent interactions and move - ment in models with spatial components , using ideas from [ 53 ] . Besides mobility issues , the size distribution of households in a community may give more detail 395 for possible types of interactions and for further information about individual actions [ 54 ] . When continuing to explore vaccination scenarios , optimal control techniques may be used to choose allocation strategies .

Basic Reproduction Number At the outset of the COVID - 19 outbreak , no vaccinations were available . Hence we take V ( 0 ) = 0 , E V ( 0 ) = 0 , π 1 = 0 , θ = 0 , which gives a model without vaccination and compartments V and E V . Using the Next Generation Matrix Method [ 33 , 34 ] with constant parameters , we derive the expression for the basic reproduction number (cid:60) 0 for our system . Our 410 infected compartments in order in this calculation are E , A , I , Q , and H . The matrices of new infections and transitions are respectively , F and V , given by F =   ( A + cI ) Sβ S + E + A + I + R 0 0 0 0   , V =   αE γ 1 A − α(cid:15)E ( κ + µ + γ 2 ) I − α ( 1 − (cid:15) ) E ( µ + ρ + γ 3 ) Q − κI ( γ 4 + µ H ) H − ρQ   . Computing the Jacobian matrices F and V of F and V respectively at the disease - free equilibrium ( S 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) , where S 0 is the initial number of susceptibles before the COVID - infection is introduced into the system , we obtain F =     0 β cβ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0     , V =     α 0 0 0 0 − α(cid:15) γ 1 0 0 0 − α ( 1 − (cid:15) ) 0 κ + µ + γ 2 0 0 0 0 − κ µ + ρ + γ 3 0 0 0 0 − ρ γ 4 + µ H     . 23 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f The inverse V − 1 matrix of the Jacobian matrix V is given by 415 V − 1 =   1 α 0 0 0 0 (cid:15)γ 1 1 γ 1 0 0 0 1 − (cid:15) κ + µ + γ 2 0 1 κ + µ + γ 2 0 0 κ ( 1 − (cid:15) ) ( κ + µ + γ 2 ) ( µ + ρ + γ 3 ) 0 κ ( κ + µ + γ 2 ) ( µ + ρ + γ 3 ) 1 µ + ρ + γ 3 0 ( 1 − (cid:15) ) κρ ( κ + µ + γ 2 ) ( µ + ρ + γ 3 ) ( γ 4 + µ H ) 0 κρ ( κ + µ + γ 2 ) ( µ + ρ + γ 3 ) ( γ 4 + µ H ) ρ ( µ + ρ + γ 3 ) ( γ 4 + µ H ) 1 γ 4 + µ H   , and the next generation matrix FV − 1 is given as FV − 1 =   β(cid:15)γ 1 + cβ ( 1 − (cid:15) ) κ + µ + γ 2 βγ 1 cβ κ + µ + γ 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   . The reproduction number (cid:60) 0 , which is the the spectral radius of FV − 1 , is given by (cid:60) 0 = β(cid:15)γ 1 + cβ ( 1 − (cid:15) ) κ + µ + γ 2 . 24 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f [ 1 ] H . - U .
