These early visions were joined by working systems that supported link - based navigation among documents as well as branching points within ( hyper ) documents [ Engelbart 1984 ] . As the use of hypertext systems became more widespread , researchers realized that readers could become confused or lost as they navigated large networks [ Conklin 1987a ] . Systems such as NoteCards [ Halasz 1987 ] addressed this problem by displaying maps of the hypertext ' s network structure . The success of NoteCards ' s " browser cards " and other hypertext maps gave rise to systems in which the user ' s main interaction with the hypertext was through a network map rather than a document viewer . For example , systems such as gIBIS [ Conklin 1988 ] and Aquanet [ Marshall 1991 ] presented a visual network containing typed links and nodes where the types are visually distinguished within the map ; the network could be edited and manipulated through this presentation . The move from document - centered hypertext systems to map - based hypertext systems had some unforeseen but far - reaching implications : relationships between nodes could be expressed in more than one way . Maps showed interconnectedness explicitly , usually in the form of a directed graph . But also node proximity came into play ; relationships among different nodes or documents could be indicated simply on the basis of their relative location . The use of these map - based hypertext systems to author new information spaces uncovered an interesting phenomenon . Users avoided the explicit linking mechanisms in favor of the more implicit expression of relationships through spatial proximity and visual attributes [ Marshall 1992 ] . Further analysis showed that the use of these spatial and visual cues to imply relationships applied not only to map - based hypertext systems , but also to traditional hypertext systems and in the physical arrangement of paper and notecards [ Marshall 1993 ] . New interface requirements arose from these observations of practice . Specifically , there was a need to support the expression of the implicit and transient relationships that develop between nodes [ Marshall 1995 ] .

Spatial hypertext systems like VIKI [ Marshall 1994 ] emerged to support this new method of interacting with information . Commonly used visual attributes like color , shape , and border width can be readily changed to enable " information triage " , the rapid interpretation and assimilation of new information [ Marshall 1997a ] . To better support the manipulation of transient perceptual structures , VIKI includes a spatial parser that recognizes patterns such as vertical and horizontal lists , stacks , and composites . Recognized structures provide easy access to the different levels of perceptual structure within a complicated information space and support the transition of these implicit structures into explicit hypertext [ Shipman 1995 ] . 2 Benefits of Spatial Hypertext Given this historical perspective on spatial hypertext and a range of experiences with its use , what can we infer about the types of activities for which it will be useful ? The most basic question is why is a spatial interface useful at all ( compared to document - centered interfaces ) . Our experience indicates four major benefits : ( 1 ) it takes advantage of people ' s considerable visual recognition and intelligence ; ( 2 ) it facilitates constructive ambiguity ; ( 3 ) it supports emerging problem - solving strategies ; and ( 4 ) it reduces overhead in communicating with others . A spatial interface allows users to take advantage of their visual memory and pattern recognition . Remembering where one saw a document in a visual workspace is a process of recognizing the area in which a document was located at a progressively finer - grained level rather than having to remember the navigational path one took to get to the document . Visual recognition also enables the expression of relation variations - - people recognize visual patterns as being of the same or similar type even when they are not identical ; this introduces a way to compose and share imperfect composites . Another benefit of spatial hypertext is its facility for constructive ambiguity . Where a link in a document - centered hypertext either exists or does not in a particular presentation of the material , placement of a node close but not quite with others can imply some indecision or potential for a relation between the nodes . Allowing people to express ambiguity more easily enables them to perform tasks such as analysis or design where interpretations form as they work with the materials . It is not only the case that the interpretation of individual documents changes over time in a spatial hypertext , but the visual language representing the interpretation changes as well . A study of users performing short - term interpretation tasks showed that visual languages emerge as users ' understanding of the task and their method of approaching the task co - evolved [ Marshall 1997a ] . The use of a visual attribute to represent some abstract information about node content changed over time ; for example , color might start off indicating the usefulness of a document but later be used to encode domain - specific characteristics of the content . Such changes indicate that users adapt their solution strategies as they gain more insight into their task . Aquanet and other systems with predefined types and relations make the overhead for making such changes in mid - task overwhelming and very unlikely to occur . Many tasks require information to be shared among a group of collaborators . Hypertext ' s application to information sharing has been investigated by many systems including the Virtual Notebook System [ Shipman 1989 ] and Sepia [ Streitz 1992 ] . The initial study of spatial layouts of information implied a correlation between the number of people sharing an information space and the degree of visual structure apparent in the arrangement . When it was necessary for more people to understand the information space , they created a higher degree of perceptual structure and followed it more strictly . As with sharing information in a navigational hypertext or file system , users must agree on a basic framework in order to effectively communicate . In contrast with a navigational hypertext or file system , effective use of ambiguous and implicit relationships means the spatial hypertext does not require on users to agree on particular relationships or agree on their interpretation . Shipman Spatial Hypertext : An Alternative to Navigational and Semantic Links 3 ACM Computing Surveys , Vol . 31 , Number 4es , December 1999 3 Impact of Spatial Hypertext Hypertext research has evolved into a number of interrelated sub - areas of specialization . Spatial hypertext has contributed to a number of these lines of hypertext research : playing into the discussion of hypertext literary theory ; framing the discussion of visualization and interaction techniques for hypertext information ; challenging the open - hypermedia research community with a different model of hypertext ; and motivating work on Web workspaces . Theoretical discussions of hypertext have long explored the role of the reader . Spatial hypertext becomes intertwined with these discussions when theorists begin to take a closer look at how readers may interact with texts , taking a step beyond the reader - as - writer foundation . As an important example , Rosenberg has introduced the notion of the reader as gatherer [ Rosenberg 1996 ] . In his vision of interaction , document - centered hypertexts invite " or " style traversal : a reader can choose to go to this document or that ; by contrast , spatial hypertexts invite " and " interactions in which the reader can simultaneously apprehend many different nodes [ Rosenberg 1997 ] . The representational malleability of spatial hypertext is also considered important ; early critiques of the rhetoric of hypertext call for a need to reform the established structural rigidity of hypertext and move to a more exploratory one [ Moulthrop 1991 ] . In fact , one element of Greco ' s call for a political praxis of hypertext involves the use of hypertext to explore interpretive frameworks and theories reflects the most basic goals of spatial hypertext [ Greco 1996 ] . Kolb , a philosopher , further discusses the role of flexible representations of interpretation [ Kolb 1997 ] . The properties of ambiguity and emergence are appealing to those who are interested in reframing existing texts . Visualizations of hypertext networks have evolved since the original hypertext maps that inspired spatial hypertext . There are now visualizations involving algorithms that cluster nodes or infer a hierarchy to generate visual representations that are simpler and easier to use than the map of the entire link network [ Durand 1998 ] . Additionally , visualizations have explored the use of three - dimensional representations for hypertext - - including the placement of text into virtual renditions of physical worlds or text - based spatial environments [ Dieberger 1995 ] . Within VIKI , the constant shortage of screen real estate and the practice of performing multiple tasks simultaneously led to the development of a multi - focus fisheye view [ Shipman 1999 ] . The goal of open - hypermedia research is to create a protocol that allows links to exist across different hypertext systems and information stored in one system to be displayed and manipulated in another . For systems that are based on a node and link model of hypertext the primary concerns involve versioning , permissions , and composites . Spatial hypertext , because of the lack of links or other explicit relationships between nodes , challenges the open - hypermedia research protocols to consider information structuring at a more abstract level [ NÃ¼rnberg 1999 ] . Relationships implied in a spatial layout may need to be converted to a link in a document - centered hypertext system while links in such a system need to be converted into a generated layout in a spatial system . Additionally , the ambiguity of links and spatial composites in a spatial hypertext are difficult to express in a node - and - link based system . The growth of the Web has led to a growing number of systems that provide " Web workspaces " in which users can collect , organize , and otherwise work with information . VIKI itself includes a number of interconnections with the Web including the ability to author presentations containing Web - based information [ Shipman 1997 ] . Additionally , systems like Web Squirrel [ Bernstein 1996 ] , D - LITE [ Cousins 1997 ] , Web Forager [ Card 1996 ] and Data Mountain [ Robertson 1998 ] provide workspaces for analysis and interpretation similar to that of VIKI . 4 Future of Spatial Hypertext Spatial hypertext emerged from the graphical presentation of traditional hypertexts as maps . The problems of understanding the context of the information currently being read and remembering how one got to a particular location are ever more a problem with the growth of the Web as a central public information resource . The benefits of a spatial representations and interfaces ensure continued research into spatial hypertext and Web workspaces .
