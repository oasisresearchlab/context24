The purpose of the present study was to explore whether specific HLA - DRB1 alleles ( DRB1 * 07 , DRB1 * 12 , DRB1 * 15 ) confer susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma . Methods : Case - control studies on HLA - DRB1 alleles association with HCC were searched up to January 2010 through a systematic review of the literature . The odds ratios ( ORs ) of HLA - DRB1 allele distributions in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were analyzed against healthy controls . The meta - analysis software REVMAN 5 . 0 was applied for investigating heterogeneity among individual studies and for summarizing all the studies . Meta - analysis was performed using fixed - effect or random - effect methods , depending on absence or presence of significant heterogeneity . Results : Eight case - control studies were included in the final analysis . Among the 3 HLA - DRB1 alleles studied , DRB1 * 07 and DRB1 * 12 were significantly associated with the risk of HCC in the whole populations ( OR = 1 . 65 , 95 % CI : 1 . 08 – 2 . 51 , P = 0 . 02 and OR = 1 . 59 , 95 % CI : 1 . 09 – 2 . 32 , P = 0 . 02 , respectively ) . No significant association was established for DRB1 * 15 allele with HCC in the whole populations . Subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed that DRB1 * 07 , DRB1 * 12 and DRB1 * 15 alleles significantly increased the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in Asians ( OR = 2 . 10 , 95 % CI : 1 . 06 - 4 . 14 , P = 0 . 03 ; OR = 1 . 73 , 95 % CI : 1 . 17 - 2 . 57 , P = 0 . 006 and OR = 3 . 22 , 95 % CI : 1 . 63 - 6 . 37 , P ﹤ 0 . 001 , respectively ) . Conclusion : These results support the hypothesis that specific HLA - DRB1 alleles might influence the susceptibility of hepatocellular carcinoma . Large , multi - ethnic confirmatory and well designed studies are needed to determine the host genetic determinants of hepatocellular carcinoma . Background Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is linked to the interaction between genetic , immunologic , environmental , dietary , and life style factors . Its incidence and distribution vary widely among ethnic groups , sex , and geographic regions . Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third most common cause of cancer - related deaths worldwide with about 600 , 000 patients dying from the disease annually [ 1 ] . Asian countries account for nearly 78 % of the roughly 600 , 000 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) reported globally each year [ 2 ] . China alone accounts for more than 50 % of the world’s cases [ 3 ] . HBV and HCV infection , liver cirrhosis , male gender , and old age are important risk factors of HCC . The clustering of HCC within families raises the possibility that genetic factors are also involved in susceptibility to HCC . The Major Histocompatibility Complex ( MHC ) plays a key role in anti - virus and tumor defense . Human leukocyte antigens ( HLA ) function in the regulation of immune response to foreign antigens and discrimination of self from non - self antigens . They are encoded by a series of closely linked genetic loci found on chromosome 6 [ 4 - 5 ] . HLA polymorphism is implicated in conferring genetic susceptibility to a large number of immune mediated diseases , including some cancers . Given the pivotal role of HLA molecules in the immune system , several studies have been performed to investigate the association between specific HLA alleles and HCC . However , the association between HLA - DRB1 alleles and HCC in different ethnic populations that has been reported is controversial . Many conflicting reports have been published to date ; thus , we performed a systematic review of all of the relevant studies published in the literature to evaluate the association between HLA - DRB1 alleles and HCC . Our principal objectives were to clarify the specific HLA - DRB1 alleles that conferred susceptibility to or which protected against HCC . Methods Search strategy Electronic databases ( PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure ) were used to search for all genetic association studies evaluating the HLA - DRB1 polymorphism and HCC in humans in all languages up to January 2010 . The search strategy was based on combinations of the terms : ( Human leukocyte antigen or HLA ) AND ( Hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC ) AND ( variants or polymorphism or alleles ) . We also performed a full manual search from the bibliographies of selected papers . We also contacted the authors of studies containing relevant information , who did not report the results necessary for this analysis . Unpublished data were also accepted if an abstract was available and further information was obtained from the author . Selection criteria In the meta - analysis , the following inclusive selection criteria were set and reviewed by two independent investigators : ( 1 ) each trial is an independent case - control study ; ( 2 ) the purpose of all studies and statistical methods is similar ; ( 3 ) it supplied enough information to calculate the odds ratio ( OR ) ; ( 4 ) HLA - DRB1 alleles were molecularly typed ( high or low resolution level ) . The following exclusive selection criteria were set : ( 1 ) incomplete raw data ; ( 2 ) repetitive reports ( if more than one version of the same study was retrieved , only the most recent is used ) ; ( 3 ) materials and methods were not well - described and reliable . Although assessment of study quality is considered important for systematic reviews and meta - analyses , scoring methods have been considered problematic [ 6 ] and may not accurately assess the quality measures of interest [ 7 ] . Therefore , we used reliability of patient selection , molecular typing method , and statistical analysis method as quality variables . The frequency of HLA - DRB1 alleles varies according to ethnic and racial background , with some alleles being extremely rare . Therefore , articles were not required to identify all alleles for inclusion . Data extraction The studies were independently evaluated by two researchers . Discrepancies in the evaluations of some studies were resolved by discussion between the reviewers . The following data were collected from each study : authors , publication year , journal , publication type and language , HLA genotyping method , allele genotyped , allele frequencies , numbers of cases and controls , definitions criteria used for HCC , HCC sample description , controls sample description . Statistical analysis Homogeneity was calculated by Cochran ' s Q test ( α = 0 . 05 ) . If the results of the Q test had no significant heterogeneity , the Mantel - Haenszel fixed effect model ( Peto method ) was used for the combination of data ; If the results of the Q test had significant heterogeneity , the Dersimonian - Laird random effects model ( DL method ) were used for the combination of data [ 8 ] . A pooled OR was presented as a standard plot with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs ) . In the absence of heterogeneity , the two methods provided identical results . As a measure of association between HCC and HLA - DRB1 alleles , we combined odds ratios ( ORs ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs ) stratified by gene subtype of patients and controls in a study . Funnel plots and the Egger ' s regression asymmetry test were used to evaluate publication bias [ 9 ] . All P values presented are two - tailed . To reduce heterogeneity and to evaluate whether there was a different genotype effect in predefined subgroups of studies , we performed subgroup analysis according to the ethnicity . We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the stability of the results by sequential omission of individual studies . The analyses were performed using Revman 5 . 0 provided by the Cochrane Collaboration . Results Literature assessment Figure 1 shows the flow chart of publications identified by the literature search . Search strategy allowed us to identify 84 studies for potential inclusion in the meta - analysis . Finally 8 case - control studies relating to HLA - DRB1 alleles polymorphism and susceptibility to HCC qualified on the basis of our selection criteria [ 10 - 17 ] . A total of 957 subjects were studied ( including 341 patients and 616 controls ) . The main features of the studies included in the meta - analysis are shown in Table 1 . Among the eight studies , five studies were conduct in Asian countries ; two were conduct in European countries , and one was conduct in African countries . The diagnosis of HCC was based on at least one of the following criteria : classical histological characteristics or serum a - fetoprotein ( AFP ) level higher than 500 µ g / ml together with radiological findings ( ultrasound and / or CT ) consistent with HCC . Mean or median age was not stated in 4 / 8 reports and sex in 4 / 8 . HIV status was determined in only one report [ 11 ] . HLA - DRB1 alleles were molecularly typed ( high or low resolution level ) . Five studies used low resolution molecular typing for HLA , while three used high resolution molecular typing for HLA . Low resolution molecular typing methods for HLA could not identify the specific alleles . Accurate methods for HLA class II typing should involve the combination of PCR - SSOP , PCR - SSP , and PCR - SSCP [ 18 ] . Meta - analysis : Association between HLA - DRB1 alleles with HCC A total of 13 HLA - DRB1 alleles were studied in the 8 case - control studies , but only 3 alleles ( DRB1 * 07 , DRB1 * 12 , DRB1 * 15 ) was extracted from the studies to investigate their association with HCC , which were reported at least six of the eight case - control studies . Statistics calculated for each study are shown in the forest plot ( Figure 2 - 4 ) . In the meta - analysis , overall the frequencies of HLA - DRB1 * 07 allele was 20 . 1 % ( 59 of 281 ) in HCC and 15 . 2 % ( 71 of 466 ) in controls . The heterogeneity test indicates that the variation of trial - specific ORs was not statistically significant ( χ 2 = 10 . 79 , P = 0 . 06 and > 0 . 05 ) , so the fixed - effect method was used to combine the results . The combined OR for the association of HLA - DRB1 * 07 allele with the risk for HCC in the whole populations was determined to be 1 . 65 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 08 – 2 . 51 ) , and was statistically significant ( P = 0 . 02 and < 0 . 05 ) . In sensitivity analysis , the exclusion of individual studies did not change this significant result , except for exclusion of the study by Pan et al and El - Chennawi et al , which produced a non - significant association . Subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed that HLA - DRB1 * 07 allele significantly increased the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in Asians ( OR = 2 . 10 , 95 % CI : 1 . 06 - 4 . 14 , P = 0 . 03 ) . Overall the frequencies of HLA - DRB1 * 12 allele was 26 . 3 % ( 74 of 281 ) in HCC and 16 . 1 % ( 83 of 516 ) in controls . The heterogeneity test indicates that the variation of trial - specific ORs was not statistically significant ( χ 2 = 9 . 00 , P = 0 . 11 and > 0 . 05 ) , so the fixed - effect method was used to combine the results . The combined OR for the association of HLA - DRB1 * 12 allele with the risk for HCC in the whole populations was determined to be 1 . 59 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 09 – 2 . 32 ) , and was statistically significant ( P = 0 . 02 and < 0 . 05 ) . In sensitivity analysis , the exclusion of individual studies did not change this significant result , except for exclusion of the study by Donaldson , et al and Sun , et al , which produced a non - significant association . Subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed that HLA - DRB1 * 12 allele significantly increased the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in Asians ( OR = 1 . 73 , 95 % CI : 1 . 17 - 2 . 57 , P = 0 . 006 ) . Meta - analysis for HLA - DRB1 * 15 allele was carried out , but it did not show any statistical effect in the whole populations . Subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed that HLA - DRB1 * 15 allele significantly increased the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in Asians ( OR = 3 . 22 , 95 % CI : 1 . 63 - 6 . 37 , P ﹤ 0 . 001 ) . Figure 5 - 7 show the funnel plot analysis to detect publication bias of each study for DRB1 * 07 , DRB1 * 12 and DRB1 * 15 , respectively . The shape of the funnel plot seemed to be asymmetrical , suggesting that publication bias might affect the findings of our meta - analysis . Discussion The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether specific HLA - DRB1 alleles are associated with the development / protection of HCC . We analyzed the published studies investigating the association between HLA - DRB1 alleles and HCC . Studies concerning this possible association have been undertaken since the early 1996s [ 19 ] . To our knowledge , this is the first published meta - analysis investigating this association . Our meta - analysis of eight studies revealed that DRB1 * 07 and DRB1 * 12 were significantly associated with the risk of HCC in the whole populations ( OR = 1 . 65 , 95 % CI : 1 . 08 – 2 . 51 , P = 0 . 02 and OR = 1 . 59 , 95 % CI : 1 . 09 – 2 . 32 , P = 0 . 02 , respectively ) . Subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed that DRB1 * 07 and DRB1 * 12 alleles also significantly increased the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in Asians ( OR = 2 . 10 , 95 % CI : 1 . 06 - 4 . 14 , P = 0 . 03 ; OR = 1 . 73 , 95 % CI : 1 . 17 - 2 . 57 , P = 0 . 006 , respectively ) . No significant association was established for DRB1 * 15 allele with HCC in the whole populations . Subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed that DRB1 * 15 alleles significantly increased the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in Asians ( OR = 3 . 22 , 95 % CI : 1 . 63 - 6 . 37 , P ﹤ 0 . 001 ) . Moreover , HLA - DRB1 alleles polymorphism have been reported to be associated with other cancers and autoimmune diseases , including cervical squamous cell carcinoma , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , autoimmune hepatitis , inflammatory bowel disease , multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes , and meta - analyses have been done for these diseases [ 20 - 26 ] . Additionally , because the information used in our research was based on data from observational studies , some limitations should be discussed in this meta - analysis and the results should be considered with caution . A primary cause for the difference in results by different authors may be related to the great variability of the frequency of HLA alleles in different populations . It is quite possible that one ethnic group may have some specific alleles in development / protection of HCC compared to other ethnic groups . Many studies were conducted on relatively smaller samples . Insufficient number of individuals might decrease the power to detect a difference in the distribution of DRB1 * 07 , DRB1 * 12 and DRB1 * 15 alleles between HCC patients and controls , though a true difference exist . Lack of an association may not mean that associations do not exist . Many studies did not control for the matching variables in the analysis , and the possible confounders could be among the potential causes of variation in the studies’ estimates . Different types of control groups could also be among the potential causes of variation in the studies’ estimates . Effects of interactions in other environmental / behavioral and / or viral factors may be inevitable . A complex interplay between various genes is likely to modulate the development of HCC rather than a single allele . HLA genotyping techniques must be taken into consideration because these methodologies have different sensitivities . HLA genotyping were mainly tested for by PCR with probe hybridization , but targets were not always verified by sequencing . This could hinder an effective comparison between the studies and influence the combined results . The shape of the funnel plot seemed to be asymmetrical , suggesting that publication bias might affect the findings of our meta - analysis . Furthermore , although we tried to maximize our efforts to identify all relevant published studies in peer - reviewed journals , it is possible that some escaped our attention . In spite of these , our meta - analysis also had some advantages . First , substantial number of cases and controls were pooled from different studies , which significantly increased statistical power of the analysis . Second , the quality of case – control studies included in the current meta - analysis was satisfactory based on our selection criteria . Third , the patients were phenotypic homogeneous subjects , diagnosed either by gold standard or by biochemical and imageology combined methods , which could reduce the heterogeneity in some extent . Conclusion Our meta - analysis suggests that HLA - DRB1 * 07 and DRB1 * 12 alleles are risk factors for HCC in the whole populations , especially in the Asians ; DRB1 * 15 allele is only associated with an increased risk of HCC in Asians . However , it is necessary to conduct large trials using standardized unbiased methods , homogeneous HCC patients and well matched controls , with the assessors blinded to the data . Moreover , gene - gene and gene - environment interactions should also be considered in the analysis . Such studies taking these factors into account may eventually lead to a better , more comprehensive understanding of the association between HLA - DRB1 polymorphism and HCC .
