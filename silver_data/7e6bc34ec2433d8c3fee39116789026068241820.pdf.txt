Mobility and the effective reproduction rate of COVID - 19 Robert B . Noland Alan M . Voorhees Transportation Center , Edward J . Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy , Rutgers University , New Brunswick , NJ , 08901 , United States A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords : COVID - 19 Mobility Social - distancing A B S T R A C T Objectives : Due to the infectiousness of COVID - 19 , the mobility of individuals has sharply decreased , both in response to government policy and self - protection . This analysis seeks to understand how mobility reductions reduce the spread of the coronavirus ( SAR - CoV - 2 ) , using readily available data sources . Methods : Mobility data from Google is correlated with estimates of the effective reproduction rate , R t , which is a measure of viral infectiousness ( Google , 2020 ) . The Google mobility data provides estimates of reductions in mobility , for six types of trips and activities . R t for US states are downloaded from an on - line platform that derives daily estimates based on data from the Covid Tracking Project ( Wissel et al . , 2020 ; Systrom et al . , 2020 ) . Fixed effects models are estimated relating mean R t and 80 % upper level credible interval estimates to changes in mobility and a time - trend value and with both 7 - day and 14 - day lags . Results : All mobility variables are correlated with median R t and the upper level credible interval of R t . Staying at home is effective at reducing R t , . Time spent at parks has a small positive effect , while other activities all have larger positive effects . The time trend is negative suggesting in - creases in self - protective behavior . Predictions suggest that returning to baseline levels of activity for retail , transit , and workplaces , will increase R t above 1 . 0 , but not for other activities . Mobility reductions of about 20 – 40 % are needed to achieve an R t below 1 . 0 ( for the upper level 80 % credible interval ) and even larger reductions to achieve an R t below 0 . 7 . Conclusions : Policy makers need to be cautious with encouraging return to normal mobility behavior , especially returns to workplaces , transit , and retail locations . Activity at parks appears to not increase R t as much . This research also demonstrates the value of using on - line data sources to conduct rapid policy - relevant analysis of emerging issues . Policy measures to reduce the spread of COVID - 19 have included " shelter - in - place " orders , shutdowns of sectors of the economy , and requirements for social distancing . These policies , as well as individual protective strategies , have effectively reduced the mobility of people in every country where they have been enacted . In this paper , I examine how mobility reductions are associated with the effective reproduction rate , R t , of COVID - 19 , and forecast the potential increase in R t should mobility return to its level in January 2020 , as well as what level of further mobility reductions are needed to reduce R t to levels that curb spread of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus responsible for COVID - 19 . A key innovation of this work is the use of readily available on - line data sources to address a rapidly emerging crisis . The effective reproduction rate is an indicator of how many people are infected by one individual . For example , if R t = 2 , this implies that each infected person transmits the virus to two others , resulting in an uncontrolled epidemic .

R t , on the other hand , can be affected by policy as well as the level of viral immunity in the population ( Delamater et al . , 2019 ) . Achieving a value of R t < 1 is a necessary condition to stop the spread of any virus . Thus , I examine changes in R t associated with changes in mobility and do this for all US states plus the District of Columbia . Policy measures to prevent the spread of COVID - 19 were first implemented in Wuhan , China on Jan 23 , 2020 ( Pan et al . , 2020 ) . These included a shutdown of public transit , traffic restrictions , home quarantine , and closure of all public places except essential shops ( grocery stores and pharmacies ) . Face masks were required in all public spaces . These measures , in combination , were shown to reduce the effective reproduction rate from 3 . 8 to almost 1 . 0 , with further measures reducing it well below 1 . 0 ( Pan et al . , 2020 ) . Various studies ( most published as pre - prints ) have examined the effectiveness of specific policies for curbing the spread of COVID - 19 . An analysis of policies implemented in US states determined that social distancing measures were effective at reducing case - loads , with a lag of up to 15 days ( Courtemanche et al . , 2020 ) . The same study found no statistically significant reductions associated with school closures and bans on large events ; however , " shelter - in - place orders " and bans on restaurant and entertainment centers were effective . Another study evaluated how various policies affected mobility , using Google mobility data for US states ( Abouk and Heydari , 2020 ) . Their results suggest that stay - at - home orders were the most effective at reducing mobility while closure of non - essential businesses and restaurants was moderately effective . They found school closures and bans on large events as not affecting mobility ; another study found that these two policies also did not affect case - loads ( Courtemanche et al . , 2020 ) . It is likely that banning large events is not noticeable in the aggregated Google Mobility data , and school mobility is not one of the mobility factors in the data . Another study found that state shelter - in - place orders were effective at reducing total case - loads after about a three - week lag ( Dave et al . , 2020 ) . An analysis of Google data for US states linked to case reports determined there was a growing incidence over time and that time spent at parks increased the incidence of COVID - 19 ( Paez , 2020 ) . These studies suggest that policies aimed at reducing mobility have curbed the number of cases , but they do not estimate mobility effects directly . Reductions in mobility have typically occurred before lockdown orders were issued . For example , many universities moved to remote learning and limitations on working in the office before lockdowns were issued . Likewise , many firms began limiting employee travel , for example to business meetings prior to lockdowns . One recent study examined mobility changes in 25 US counties and found evidence that reductions in mobility reduced growth in cases ( Badr et al . , 2020 ) . Other research has demonstrated the effectiveness of lockdowns in reducing R t , but here I focus on the underlying mobility behavior for all 50 states and the District of Columbia , rather than the explicit policies ( Arroyo - Marioli et al . , 2020 ) . Results show a strong correlation between mobility and R t . Specifically , retail / recreational activity , such as eating in restaurants , office work activities , and public transit usage all are associated with increases in transmission of the virus . Shopping at grocery stores and pharmacies has a smaller association , while affects associated with parks are minor ; staying at home reduces transmission . Im - plications for reducing the spread of the coronavirus are that the reductions in mobility have been effective , but also need to be maintained for longer periods . 1 . Data and methods Mobility data was made publicly available by Google ( 2020 ) and is based upon cell phone tracking data that measures clustering of individuals at six place categories . The places are grocery / pharmacy stores , retail stores / recreation ( including restaurants ) , parks , transit stations , workplaces , and residential locations . The data are anonymized and aggregated by Google and are used to estimate visits and lengths of stays at specific places in Google Maps . The data for each place location and for each US state is relative to a median value between Jan 3 – Feb 6 , 2020 and changes are relative to the same day of the week and reported as percent changes ; data was downloaded on June 26th , 2020 and was current up to June 23rd , 2020 . 1 An example of the change in mobility is shown in Fig . 1 and Fig . 2 for the states of Arizona and New Jersey . New Jersey was one of the most hard hit states early in the pandemic ( with nearly 15 , 000 deaths as of late June 2020 ) ; Arizona experienced large case loads in late June 2020 . New Jersey implemented an early lockdown on March 18 , 2020 , while Arizona had a later lockdown on March 30 , 2020 , that was removed on May 15 , 2020 ( Lee et al . , 2020 ; Popovich , 2020 ) . As can be seen , time spent at retail , work , and transit locations declined noticeably and even before the lockdowns implemented in each state . Time spent at grocery / pharmacy locations also was lower , suggesting both fewer trips to these locations and less time spent there . There is variability in time spent at parks , primarily due to variation in weather . Time spent at residential locations increased . While these lockdowns clearly affected mobility , it largely coincided with self - protective measures that businesses and individuals were already taking . Badr et al . ( 2020 ) also documented reductions in mobility before lockdowns were implemented . Mobility began to gradually increase even before the lockdowns expired . Data for R t for each state in the United States ( including the District of Columbia ) was downloaded from https : / / rt . live / and is explained in associated blog posts ( Systrom et al . , 2020 ) . Estimates are based on methods outlined in Bettencourt and Ribeiro ( 2008 ) . Case data for https : / / rt . live / are from the Covid tracking project at https : / / covidtracking . com / ( Wissel et al . , 2020 ) . Estimates of R t are Bayesian and dependent on prior information and thus change as more data becomes available . An 80 % credible interval is provided with the estimates . Given that replicability by doing an updated download is not possible , the full dataset used is available at https : / / github . com / rbnoland / COVID - data . To evaluate the impact of mobility on R t , fixed effects models that control for state - level effects are estimated . That is , these models 1 Additional data was downloaded on Nov 29th , 2020 , in order to update the Fig . I did not update the analysis as COVID - 19 testing started to suffer major delays starting in the Summer of 2020 and thus data on cases was not as reliable . R . B . Noland Journal of Transport & Health 20 ( 2021 ) 101016 3 control for unmeasured attributes that might affect the dependent variable . A time - trend variable , which starts on the first day that R t is estimated for each state is also included ; these start dates vary based on the cases in each state , thus our time trend normalizes for the start of infectious spread in each state . The time trend controls for changes over time and could represent practices such as increased mask - wearing , increased home shopping deliveries , and additional protective measures taken by firms and individuals . Increasing herd immunity may also be represented by the time trend . Estimates suggest this could be much larger than actual reported cases ( Hortaçsu et al . , 2020 ) Standard errors were estimated using a bootstrap with 100 repetitions . This was done as qq - plots suggested some minor deviations from normality in the residuals . However , this made little difference in the standard errors given the high levels of statistical sig - nificance in the models and correspondingly low standard errors on the coefficients of interest . The mobility measures provided are all highly correlated , making individual inferences on each impossible if all are included within the same model . Others who have used this data have aggregated it into an index ( Arroyo - Marioli et al . , 2020 ) . Paez ( 2020 ) estimated models with park and workplace mobility only , as these are the least correlated with each other . The models that I estimate include each separately . This allows a comparison of the relative impact of each independently . Models with a 7 - day and 14 - day lag of each mobility variable are estimated , given that that the onset of symptoms can take almost up to seven days and actual case reports ( usually when symptoms are more severe ) can take longer . An average incubation period of 11 . 5 days has been estimated ( Lauer et al . , 2020 ) . Estimated models are log - linear , using the log of R t to avoid predictions less than zero . The goal of policy makers is to keep R t below one . A value below one implies that infections are decreasing and aiming for this will result in reductions in total cases and can be effective at stopping an epidemic . 2 The estimates of R t include an 80 % credible interval , that is , the actual value has an 80 % likelihood of being somewhere within the reported range . Focusing policy on the median value may not be effective , thus additional models using the upper limit of the credible interval are estimated . If one wants greater certainty in the Fig . 1 . Mobility data for Arizona , from Feb 15 , 2020 to Nov 27 , 2020 . Represents percent change from baseline between Jan 3 , 2020 to Feb 6 , 2020 , measured relative to each day of the week . Seven - day moving average is shown . A statewide lockdown was initiated on March 30 , 2020 and ended on May 15 , 2020 . Both are shown by the vertical lines ( Lee et al . , 2020 ; Popovich , 2020 ) . 2 In the UK , government officials have stated a goal of getting and keeping R t below one ( BBC News , 2020 ) , although this policy has been criticized as other metrics also need to be considered ( Adam , 2020 ) . R . B . Noland Journal of Transport & Health 20 ( 2021 ) 101016 4 impact of mobility reductions , keeping the upper limit of the credible interval below one is a more risk - averse policy . Predictions are also presented based on the models with a 7 - day lag and how this affects the upper level of the credible interval . Finally , I use the models to predict how much mobility needs to be reduced to achieve an upper level credible value of R t = 1 and R t = 0 . 7 , as the latter would be most effective at stopping further spread of the coronavirus . 2 . Results Fixed effects modeling results are presented in Tables 1 – 4 for US state - level models . In all cases the coefficients are positive , except for residential locations . That is , increased mobility at locations other than one ’ s residence is associated with increases in R t . This demonstrates the effectiveness of reductions in mobility to reduce the spread of COVID - 19 . Coefficient values for models with the upper level of the credible interval of R t are slightly larger ( Table 2 and Table 4 ) . The models have slightly lower coefficient values when the mobility variables are lagged 14 days , but the patterns are similar . Comparing the values of mobility coefficients within each set of models shows that activity spent at parks has the smallest coef - ficient value , suggesting less viral spread associated with time spent at parks . Other mobility coefficients are generally similar , though grocery / pharmacy coefficients are larger in the models with 7 - day lags . Mobility coefficients for residences , while negative , have a larger absolute value , suggesting time spent at home is protective of viral spread . The time trend variable for days since the start of the epidemic in each area is uniformly negative . This variable represents un - measured effects that change over time . It may be accounting for individual protective actions being taken by people and firms , such as requirements to wear masks or the installation of protective barriers in stores , among other actions . Predictions of potential increases in R t without mobility reductions are also estimated . Setting the mobility values to zero assumes mobility returns to the average of activity from Jan 3 – Feb 6 , 2020 . The time trend is set to its value on June 23rd , 2020 , thus incorporating individual protective actions taken to date . The RMSE for each model is shown , which is a measure of predictive ac - curacy ; there is little variation between models . Using the models in Table 2 , based on the upper level of the credible interval and a 7 - day lag , predicted results for each US state are shown in Table 5 . Every state has a predicted R t above one , for retail , transit , workplaces , Fig . 2 . Mobility data for New Jersey , from Feb 15 , 2020 to Nov 27 , 2020 . Represents percent change from baseline between Jan 3 , 2020 to Feb 6 , 2020 , measured relative to each day of the week . Seven - day moving average is shown . A statewide lockdown was initiated on March 18 , 2020 and expired on June 9 , 2020 , with a slow reopening of various businesses . Both are shown by the vertical lines ( Lee et al . , 2020 ) . R . B . Noland Journal of Transport & Health 20 ( 2021 ) 101016 5 and residences if mobility activity for these destinations returned to normal . Grocery / pharmacy locations are below 1 . 0 in most states , while parks are uniformly below 1 . 0 . Prediction spreadsheets are available for all models at https : / / github . com / rbnoland / COVID - data and different levels of mobility increases or decreases can be tested with these . While a return to normal mobility activity will not reduce R t , this leads to the question of how much mobility reduction is needed to achieve an R t = 1 . In addition , mobility reductions to achieve R t = 0 . 7 are also estimated . Using the same model for the upper level credible interval estimates and assuming the time trend up to June 23rd , 2020 , the average across all states and the largest possible mobility reductions needed are shown in Table 6 . Table 7 and Table 8 present the mobility reductions needed by each state to achieve R t = 1 and R t = 0 . 7 , respectively . Large mobility reductions are needed for retail , transit , and work activities for achieving both levels of Rt . Mobility reductions for grocery shopping are also needed to achieve R t = 0 . 7 and even for parks .

Discussion and conclusions The effectiveness of mobility reductions at reducing the effective reproduction number of COVID - 19 is clearly demonstrated by these results . This analysis does not include any policy variables enacted by individual US states or counties . Other researchers have or are evaluating the effectiveness of these policies on total case - loads , as opposed to infectiousness ( Abouk and Heydari , 2020 ; Cour - temanche et al . , 2020 ; Dave et al . , 2020 ; Hsiang et al . , 2020 ; Pan et al . , 2020 ) . This work largely confirms the effectiveness of those policies that reduce mobility , which is the primary factor keeping people apart . Some of this is voluntary mobility reductions that are independent of actual government shelter - in - place orders as people took protective action prior to government mandated restrictions . However , the results suggest that further reductions in mobility might be needed to successfully reduce R t values below 1 or even below 0 . 7 , which would essentially end large scale community transmission . While the each of the models presented only includes one mobility variable , due to collinearity , results still provide some differ - entiation of the effectiveness of specific mobility reductions . Activity at parks has the lowest impact on the effective reproduction rate , suggesting that with appropriate social distancing guidelines these should be left open for activities . Mobility associated with time spent at grocery stores and pharmacies also seems to not affect R t as much , but additional reductions might be needed to reduce R t Table 7 Mobility reduction needed on June 23rd , 2020 for upper level credible interval of R t = 1 .

B . Noland Journal of Transport & Health 20 ( 2021 ) 101016 8 below 1 . Time spent at home is very effective at reducing R t . A limitation of this work is that we do not know the interactive effects of staying at home versus engaging in other activities ; that is , more time spent at home , while protective , means less time spent elsewhere . The time trend variable included in the estimates suggests other unmeasured factors are at play in reducing the effective repro - duction rate . Increased use of face masks might be one of these , as research is showing that face masks are effective for mitigating spread of COVID - 19 ( Mitze et al . , 2020 ) . Further work is clearly needed to estimate the effect of these and other protective measures . Warmer and more humid seasonal weather may also account for some of the time trend effects ( Wang et al . , 2020 ; Paez et al . , 2020 ) . Protective measures taken by grocery stores and pharmacies , installing physical partitions and marking out distances to keep patrons separated may be another factor , as well as resulting in less infectiousness associated with these locations . The predictions estimated suggest that there is still a need for caution in encouraging increased mobility , especially retail / recre - ational activity , such as eating in restaurants , office work activities , and public transit usage . The models estimated are associative and this means that predictions from these estimates must be considered with care ; however , the underlying biology of viral transmission suggests that keeping people distant is effective and mobility reductions are one way to achieve this . Reductions in viral transmission , however , may be temporary , as infections can increase even after substantial reductions in R t , as shown by simulations conducted by Kissler et al . ( 2020 ) .

Noland Journal of Transport & Health 20 ( 2021 ) 101016 9 Mobility reductions and social distancing are useful policies for reducing peak case - loads , i . e . to " flatten the curve " and avoid overloading health care resources . As of this writing in early January 2021 , health care systems are near or at capacity in many parts of the country and R t exceeds 1 in a large majority of states . This is despite mobility levels not returning to baseline levels but also being higher than the reductions seen during the first wave of the pandemic in the Spring of 2020 ( see Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Ultimately , to achieve herd immunity , vaccinations must be administered , which began in December 2020 . While other studies have demonstrated the relationship between mobility and case - loads , one of the key innovations of this work is the use of readily available data . This allows analysts to quickly conduct analysis of critical issues , virtually in real time to provide guidance to policy makers , demonstrating the value of openly available " big data " to address rapidly emerging issues .
