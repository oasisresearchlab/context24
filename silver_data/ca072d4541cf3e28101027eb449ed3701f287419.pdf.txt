Roux @ unige . ch C ells and organelles are delimited by lipid membranes . Membranes are fluid surfaces , ~ 4 nm thick , and are diffusion barriers to most solutes ( but not to water ) . Membrane shape changes can cause bending , shearing and stretching , and membrane tension is defined as the derivative of the membrane free energy with area change 1 , 2 . Lipid membranes are very resistant to stretch , supporting tensions up to 10 − 2 N m − 1 before lysis , with a few percent of area change 3 , 4 . Membrane tension plays an essential role in numerous cell processes . At the whole cell level , membrane tension is tightly regu - lated during cell migration 5 – 8 , cell spreading and phagocytosis 9 , 10 . During cell division , membrane tension causes a volume instability between daughter cells that is counteracted by contraction of the actin cortex 11 . Increased tension delays the last step of cell division , abscission 12 . Membrane tension also regulates subcellular processes . For example , increased tension inhibits endocytosis 13 by counter - acting clathrin polymerization 14 and activating membrane fission 15 . Membrane tension regulates the opening of mechanosensitive ion channels 16 , and the activity of TORC2 , a major regulator of cell metabolism 17 . As a consequence of its multiple roles , membrane tension is constantly regulated by the cell 18 . Despite its importance in the regulation of many cell processes , membrane tension remains notoriously difficult to measure in cells : so far , the only technique available is extraction of small membrane tubes from the plasma membrane 5 , 18 , 19 . Although this technique has provided valuable insights over the past decade , it suffers from several limitations . First , the tube radius and the force required to maintain the tube—measurements necessary for calculation of the tension—are complex to obtain independently 5 . Second , because formation of the tube requires peeling the membrane off the actin cortex , the adhesion energy of the membrane onto the actin cortex adds up to the membrane tension value . Finally , this tech - nique cannot measure the tension of intracellular membranes such as organelles . The importance of membrane tension in biological processes called for non - invasive fluorescent probes that would allow for its measurement in living cells . However , no existing tension probes have been shown to be reliable in living cells 20 – 30 . One approach , which is technically challenging , is to use the homo - FRET ( Föster resonance energy transfer ) signal of mechanosensitive ion channels 16 . Among the different mechanisms explored , photo - induced electron transfer is better for voltage sensitivity 26 , whereas solvatochromism 21 , 28 and excited - state deplanarization in molecular rotors 23 , 24 , 28 – 31 are most promising for imaging membrane order . Recently , we introduced complementary ground - state planariza - tion as a new approach to mechanosensitive membrane probes 32 . Planarizable push – pull probes can report lipid packing changes through changes in their fluorescence parameters . Lipid packing is defined as the density of lipid acyl chains : higher lipid packing is reflected by tighter and more ordered acyl chains , and lower lipid packing corresponds to more spaced and disordered acyl chains . Thus , liquid - ordered phases have higher lipid packing than liquid - disordered phases . We showed that these planarizable push – pull probes can distinguish different phases with different order 33 . In more ordered phases , lipid packing is higher , as acyl chains apply a higher pressure that planarizes the push – pulled probes . Membrane tension is also expected to change lipid packing by stretching the lipids away . However , the area increase from this stretching is very small , with a maximum of 8 % before lysis 34 . Because our push – pull probes are extremely sensitive to lipid pack - ing , we wondered if they could report such changes in membrane tension . Among the several push – pull probes we designed 2 , 32 , 33 , 35 , 36 , we called the most promising probe for measuring membrane tension , FliptR ( for ‘fluorescent lipid tension reporter’ , Fig . 1a ) 2 . FliptR consists of two large dithienothiophene flippers 33 ( Fig . 1a ) . In a non - confining environment , the two flippers are twisted out of conjugation by repulsion between the methyls and the endocyclic sulfurs next to the connecting , rotatable bond . The negatively charged carboxylate in the headgroup 2 helps to assure oriented insertion into membranes . FliptR has high photostabil - ity 2 , partitions almost equally into different membrane phases 33 , has different fluorescence absorption / emission spectra between lipid phase 2 , do not change position following a lipid phase tran - sition 33 , and does not disturb membrane order like , for example , cholesterol 36 . FliptR can planarize with an increase in lateral pres - sure ( Fig . 1b ) . Here , we report that FliptR can be used to image a A fluorescent membrane tension probe Adai Colom 1 , 2 , 3 , Emmanuel Derivery 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , Saeideh Soleimanpour 2 , 3 , Caterina Tomba 1 , 3 , Marta Dal Molin 2 , 3 , Naomi Sakai 2 , 3 , Marcos González - Gaitán 1 , 2 , 3 , Stefan Matile 2 , 3 and Aurélien Roux 1 , 2 , 3 * Cells and organelles are delimited by lipid bilayers in which high deformability is essential to many cell processes , including motility , endocytosis and cell division . Membrane tension is therefore a major regulator of the cell processes that remodel membranes , albeit one that is very hard to measure in vivo . Here we show that a planarizable push – pull fluorescent probe called FliptR ( fluorescent lipid tension reporter ) can monitor changes in membrane tension by changing its fluorescence life - time as a function of the twist between its fluorescent groups . The fluorescence lifetime depends linearly on membrane tension within cells , enabling an easy quantification of membrane tension by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy . We further show , using model membranes , that this linear dependency between lifetime of the probe and membrane tension relies on a membrane - tension - dependent lipid phase separation . We also provide calibration curves that enable accurate measurement of membrane tension using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy .

Results and discussion FliptR reports lipid order in artificial membranes . With the aim of imaging membrane tension in living cells , the large change in FliptR fluorescence lifetime with lipid phase caught our interest , as it reflects a high sensitivity to lipid packing . Moreover , the fluores - cence lifetime is independent of intensity , which changes by a factor of 10 in the planarized state versus the twisted state and is thus also independent of the optical set - up used to measure it . We first studied if the fluorescence lifetime of the probe could report the ordering state of various lipid phases . We electroformed giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) of different compositions with 1 mol % FliptR , and imaged their lifetimes using fluorescence life - time imaging microscopy ( FLIM ) . The fluorescence emission decay curves were fitted with double exponentials , from which two life - times ( τ 1 and τ 2 ) and two intensities ( I 1 and I 2 ) could be extracted ( see Methods ) . As for FliptR , the second component of the lifetime , τ 2 , only accounts for a minority of the signal , with a low number of pho - tons ( I 2 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Lifetime data presented in the fol - lowing correspond to the longest component , τ 1 . This is justified by the fact that τ 2 values are more subject to errors , as they are smaller and account for fewer emission events , and also because τ 1 is linked to the time taken for intramolecular charge transfer and thus reports directly on the mechanism by which FliptR senses applied forces . The lifetime of FliptR increased with the proportion of lipids forming the liquid - ordered ( L o ) phase . The FliptR fluorescence life - time was 3 . 75 ± 0 . 08 ns ( mean ± s . d . , as in the rest of the text , unless noted ; N = 11 , R = 43 , Fig . 1c ) for GUVs made only of 1 , 2 - dio - leoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) , which forms the liq - uid - disordered phase ( L d ) above 0 °C , 5 . 31 ± 0 . 12 ns ( N = 5 , R = 15 , with N being the number of experiments and R the number of GUVs ) for GUVs made of DOPC and cholesterol ( CL ) ( DOPC : CL , 60 : 40 ) which increases lipid order , and 6 . 39 ± 0 . 09 ns ( N = 5 , R = 25 ) for GUVs composed of brain sphingomyelin ( SM ) and CL ( 70 : 30 ) , forming a liquid - ordered phase . Moreover , when phase - separated GUVs were formed ( DOPC : SM : CL 25 : 58 : 17 ) , different domains could easily be imaged by measuring the FliptR lifetime ( Fig . 1c , L d and L o ) . Interestingly , the lifetime of FliptR in one of the domains was close to that in DOPC : CL 60 : 40 membranes ( 4 . 79 ± 0 . 21 ns ( N = 4 , R = 5 ) , compared to 5 . 31 ns for DOPC : CL 60 : 40 ) , while the lifetime in the other domain was very close to the lifetime of GUVs made of SM and CL only ( 6 . 57 ± 0 . 29 ns ( N = 4 , R = 5 ) compared to 6 . 39 ns for SM : CL 70 : 30 ) . These results show that FliptR is sensitive to lipid composition by detecting the various packing of lipids in different phases with different order ( Fig . 1c ) 2 . FliptR reports lipid order in cellular membranes . We then tested if FliptR could detect lipid composition and / or phase differences in living cells . We used HeLa fibroblastic cells and Madin – Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) epithelial cells , and when micromolar amounts of FliptR were added to the medium of non - confluent HeLa and MDCK cells , plasma membrane staining appeared in less than one minute , with enough signal to measure the lifetime accurately ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Video 1 ) . However , in epi - thelial cells , the apical membrane has been reported to form a large L o domain due to enrichment in shingolipids and cholesterol , while the basolateral membrane is reported to form a less ordered lipid phase 37 , in which FliptR required more time to reach the basolateral side ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . This may be due to the diffusion bar - rier created by the tight junctions between the apical side ( to which FliptR is delivered ) and the basolateral side . FliptR remained stably in the plasma membrane , even though limited endosomal labelling appeared after two hours of incubation with FliptR , most probably due to endocytic recycling of the probe ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . We did not notice any cell growth and / or viability defects in up to four days of culture in the presence of FliptR ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . In polarized confluent MDCK cells that have been grown on microstructured surfaces to provide different orientations of the cells towards the microscope , two clearly different lifetimes were observed ( Fig . 2b ) . The lifetime on the apical side ( towards the medium ) is higher than on the basolateral ( Fig . 2b , red colour on the apical side and green on the basolateral side ) , matching the lipid order difference in these two parts of the cells 37 , 38 . This finding clearly shows that FliptR also detects lipid packing differences in different parts and / or compartments of epithelial cells . FliptR reports changes of osmotic pressure . We then wondered if FliptR could detect changes in membrane tension in cells .

NATuRE ChEMiSTRy | VOL 10 | NOVEMBER 2018 | 1118 – 1125 | www . nature . com / naturechemistry 1119 Articles NaTuRe CHeMisTRy mon way to change the membrane tension of cells is to apply osmotic shocks . During hypoosmotic shocks ( low osmotic pressure Π from the cell culture medium ) , the cell volume and plasma membrane tension increase 39 , 40 . In contrast , under hyperosmotic shock ( high osmolarity Π ) , the volume and membrane tension decrease ( Fig . 3a ) 40 , 41 . When applying hypoosmotic shocks ( Π < 0 . 3 Osm ) on Hela and MDCK cells loaded with FliptR , we robustly observed longer lifetimes than in isoomostic conditions ( Π = 0 . 3 Osm ) , but shorter under hyperosmotic shocks ( Π > 0 . 3 Osm ) ( Fig . 3b ) . Whereas the FliptR fluorescence lifetime τ 1 stayed constant when cells were kept in isoosmotic conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) , it changed rap - idly after hypoosmotic and hyperosmotic shocks ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . Overall , the dependence of τ 1 on osmotic pressure Π from the cell medium was linear for both HeLa and MDCK cells ( Fig . 3b ) , but the slopes were clearly different ( slope = − 0 . 52 ± 0 . 03 versus − 0 . 84 ± 0 . 04 ns Osm – 1 , respectively , mean ± s . e . ) . Moreover , a better fit was obtained by fitting hypoosmotic data independently of hyperosmotic data ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . In this case , both for HeLa and MDCK cells , the slopes of the hypoosmotic data are about 0 . 3 – 0 . 4 ns Osm − 1 less than for hyperosmotic data ( Hela : Hypo , − 0 . 27 ± 0 . 13 ns Osm – 1 and Hyper : − 0 . 59 ± 0 . 04 ns Osm – 1 ; MDCK : Hypo , − 0 . 50 ± 0 . 33 ns Osm – 1 , Hyper : − 0 . 88 ± 0 . 07 ns Osm − 1 , mean ± s . e . ) . This may be explained by lowering of lipid packing following a tension increase ( see Fig . 4 and discussion ) . To test the possibility that membrane - tension - dependent changes of the FliptR lifetime are not coupled to cell active pro - cesses such as cortical acto - myosin contraction or active ion pump - ing , osmotic shocks were applied to GUVs with a lipid composition mimicking the cell plasma membrane ( POPC : SM : CL 57 : 14 : 29 ) and loaded with FliptR ( Fig . 3a ) . We found that FliptR lifetime τ 1 also increased with hypoosmotic shocks , and decreased with hypero - smotic shocks , in a way similar to that in cells ( Fig . 3b ) . Similarly , FliptR lifetime changed linearly with Π , although the changes were smaller ( slope = – 0 . 22 ns Osm – 1 ) . The robust change of τ 1 in propor - tion to Π suggests that the lifetime of FliptR could monitor changes in plasma membrane tension . FliptR reports membrane tension in cells . To measure membrane tension while applying osmotic shocks to the same cell , optical tweezers were used to pull away concanavalin A - coated polysty - rene beads that had been previously attached to the cell membrane , to produce thin membrane tubes ( Fig . 3c ) 42 . The force required to hold the bead is a direct measure—although not absolute—of cell membrane tension . We calculated the membrane tension σ from the force data using a measured value of the cell membrane bending rigidity , typically 0 . 14 pN μ m , corresponding to 35 k B T ( ref . 5 ) . We then applied an osmotic shock by flushing a new solu - tion into the microscopy chamber ( see Methods ) while record - ing FliptR lifetime and tube force . Hypoosmotic shocks led to a moderate increase in tube force , indicating a slight increase in membrane tension , whereas hyperosmotic shocks led to a dwin - dling of tube force , indicating a large membrane tension drop ( Fig . 3d ) . The change in τ 1 was linear with membrane tension σ , increasing with increasing tension . For MDCK cells , the slope was 2 . 38 ± 0 . 18 ns m mN − 1 until reaching saturation for tension values above 0 . 6 mN m − 1 , and was 0 . 196 ± 0 . 07 ns m mN − 1 after this limit ( Fig . 3d ) . For HeLa cells , the dependence was similar ; from 0 to 0 . 6 mN m − 1 the slope was 0 . 78 ± 14 ns m mN − 1 , then 0 . 26 ± 0 . 06 ns m mN − 1 at higher tensions ( Fig . 3d ) . Importantly , the change in slope ( Fig . 3d ) occurred for membrane tension values obtained under isoosmotic conditions . Values higher than the value of membrane tension in isotonic conditions were obtained for hypoosmotic shocks , whereas membrane tension values below isotonic conditions were obtained with hypertonic shock . Thus , the change in slope occurring under isotonic conditions may be due to an additional effect acting on FliptR under hypotonic con - ditions . As for lifetime as a function of osmotic pressure ( Fig . 3b ) , this additional effect may be caused by a reduction in lipid packing ( see Fig . 4 and discussion ) . These results clearly show that FliptR fluorescence lifetime reports membrane tension in cells , and that calibration is needed for each cell type . FliptR response in single lipid phase membrane is the inverse of that in cells . The response of mechanosensitive flipper probe FliptR to changes in membrane tension in cells and GUVs ( Fig . 3 ) could conceivably originate from several structural changes ( Fig . 4 ) . A change in lipid packing is perhaps the most intuitive outcome of membrane tension ( Fig . 4a , b ) 4 , 34 , 43 . However , increasing distances between lipid acyl chains following an increase in membrane ten - sion should result in a more deplanarized state of FliptR . Increasing tension should thus lead to decreasing lifetimes , an opposite response to that observed in cells ( Fig . 3 ) .

The top view corresponds to a single confocal plane ( between dashed lines in the left side view schematics ) , and , depending on the height of the cells , either the apical side ( red ) or the basolateral part ( green ) is visible ( N = 4 ) . The colour bar corresponds to lifetime in ns . NATuRE ChEMiSTRy | VOL 10 | NOVEMBER 2018 | 1118 – 1125 | www . nature . com / naturechemistry 1120 Articles NaTuRe CHeMisTRy We nevertheless carried on testing this hypothesis using SM : CL 70 : 30 GUVs , which consist of the L o phase , thus with high lipid packing at low membrane tension , as reflected by the high FliptR lifetime values in these membranes ( Fig . 1c ) . By aspirating these L o GUVs labelled with 1 mol % FliptR with a micropipette , we con - trolled and changed their tension . This tension was measured by the extraction of small membrane tubes with optical tweezers ( Fig . 5a , b ) . As expected from our hypothesis , L o SM : CL 70 : 30 GUVs demonstrated a linear decrease in FliptR lifetime with increasing tension , with a slope = − 1 . 32 ± 0 . 19 ns m mN − 1 ( Fig . 5b ) . Thus , in single - phase membranes , the FliptR response to tension is indeed dominated by loosened lipid packing with increasing distances between lipid tails ( Fig . 4b ) . This effect could also be seen as a ten - sion - induced lipid phase transition : tension may exert pulling forces on the acyl chains of lipids , allowing them to melt from the L o into the L d phase . In membranes with a composition closer to plasma membrane ( POPC : SM : CL 57 : 14 : 29 ) , the decrease in FliptR lifetime in response to increasing tension was much less pronounced ( Fig . 5b , slope = − 0 . 27 ± 0 . 05 ns m mN – 1 ) . Because of the pipette aspiration used in these experiments , only conditions where membrane tension increased could be tested ( Fig . 3b ) . This suggested that even if the response of these GUVs to micropipette aspiration is dominated by loosened lipid packing , another molecular mechanism would lower the response of FliptR to increasing tension . Indeed , the small decrease in FliptR lifetime with increasing tension applied by micropipette aspiration ( Fig . 5b ) was contrary to the significant increase in FliptR lifetime with decreasing osmotic pressure ( mem - brane tension increase ) in cells and GUVs ( Fig . 3b ) . FliptR response to tension depends on lipid phase separation . We then studied the nature of this additional molecular mechanism . One of the possible explanations for the increasing FliptR lifetime with increasing tension is that lipid tails would tilt on increasing the surface area ( Fig . 4c ) . Tilted lipid tails could be a way to adapt the rapid change of surface as observed in stretched polymer chemis - try 44 . Also , tilted lipid tails are a characteristic feature of peculiar gel phases called L β that accommodate tight packing with a surface increase 45 . Chain stretching and lipid tilting in response to increas - ing membrane tension would cause lateral compression of the acyl chains , leading to FliptR planarization and increasing its lifetime . This effect is expected to be independent of the lipid phase . We thus tested this tilting hypothesis in pure L d GUVs composed of DOPC only , and subjected them to hypo - or hyperosmotic shocks , which did not change the lifetime of FliptR ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . We thus concluded that the tilting was not the mechanism causing life - time changes in response to tension changes in cells . Planarizable push – pull probes have been suspected previously to be planarizable also by voltage because of macrodipole – poten - tial interactions 32 . Cell membranes have a voltage potential created by the ionic gradients across them . Although experimental support for significant voltage sensitivity could not be obtained , possible contributions to the response of the FliptR probe to tension had to be tested . For this purpose , we loaded neurons ( cells with high membrane potential ) with FliptR and depolarized them with an isoosmotic buffer containing 47 mM KCl ( see Methods ) . During KCl treatment , the FliptR lifetime did not change significantly ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . However , on adding a 700 mOsm hyper - osmotic sucrose solution , the FliptR lifetime dropped significantly 4 . 5 5 . 0 Hypo a b d 100 µ m 40 µ m 2 . 0 5 . 5 4 . 0 5 . 5 HeLa MDCK HeLa MDCK GUV ( POPC : SM : CL 57 : 14 : 29 ) Π ( Osm ) 0 . 0 0 . 3 0 . 6 0 . 9 1 . 2 1 . 5 1 . 8 2 . 1 σ ( mN m – 1 ) 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 τ ( n s ) 6 . 0 5 . 5 4 . 0 3 . 5 4 . 5 5 . 0 τ ( n s ) 6 . 0 5 . 5 4 . 0 3 . 5 Iso Hyper Hypo Iso Hyper Hypo Hyper c Fig . 3 | Response of FliptR fluorescence lifetime to osmotic shocks on cells and GuVs . a , FLIM images of MDCK and GUVs ( POPC : SM : CL 57 : 14 : 29 ) in isoosmotic buffer , and after hyper - or hypoosmotic shocks . b , FliptR fluorescence lifetime τ 1 as a function of osmotic pressure Π applied to HeLa cells ( orange triangles , slope hypo = − 0 . 27 ± 0 . 13 ns Osm – 1 , slope hyper = − 0 . 59 ± 0 . 04 ns Osm – 1 , mean ± s . d . as in the rest of the measurements , N = 20 ) ; MDCK cells ( purple squares , slope hypo = − 0 . 50 ± 0 . 33 ns Osm – 1 , slope hyper = − 0 . 88 ± 0 . 07 ns Osm – 1 , N = 6 ) ; and GUVs ( blue diamonds , slope hypo = − 0 . 19 ± 0 . 18 ns Osm – 1 , slope hyper = − 0 . 22 ± 0 . 03 ns Osm – 1 , N = 4 ) , with linear curve fit .

We thus concluded that FliptR is insensi - tive to membrane polarization . The last possibility to explain the coupled changes in lifetime and tension was that tension changes induce phase separation ( Fig . 4d ) . Recent studies have shown that changes in tension can cause a lipid phase separation to accommodate the area change 46 – 51 . In such a case , while the membrane is initially homogeneous , domains appear on increasing the membrane tension . The newly formed L d phase supports most of the stretch , while L o domains cluster the lipids that cannot be stretched easily . To test this possibility , GUVs were pre - pared with a lipid composition ( DOPC : SM : CL 1 : 1 : 1 ) that mimics the phase separation state of cell membranes by being close to the transition from L d to mixed L d – L o phases 52 , and thus more prone to phase separate on applying tension . These GUVs were aspirated into a micropipette to increase their tension ( Fig . 5a ) . As expected , the formation of large domains ( visualized through the lifetime image of FliptR , see also Fig . 1c ) could be observed reproducibly in GUVs aspirated in micropipettes after an abrupt increase in aspi - ration ( Fig . 5c ) . Moreover , following aspiration , while the lifetime increased in the L o domains and decreased in the L d domains , the average lifetime of FliptR on the entire GUV increased following aspiration ( Fig . 5c , middle and right panels ) . This shows that the FliptR lifetime increase with a membrane tension increase in cells ( Fig . 3d ) can be attributed to increased lipid phase separation . To further support this hypothesis , we directly investigated changes in the homogeneity of the membrane FliptR lifetime under hyper - tonic shocks . At rest , the FliptR lifetime image showed areas of higher lifetime ( Fig . 5d and Supplementary Video 2 ) , which are probably related to inhomogeneities of the lipid composition . After a hypertonic shock , these areas seemed to disappear ( Fig . 5d and Supplementary Video 2 ) , suggesting that , with a membrane tension decrease , the local plasma membrane composition becomes more homogeneous . Thus , the FliptR response to tension in cells strongly depends on a tension - induced change in phase separation , a mechanism that explains the overall change of FliptR lifetime in response to osmotic shocks in cells . Following tension - induced phase separa - tion , the overall lifetime response is dominated by FliptR in the more ordered phase ( Fig . 4a , d ) . This explanation seems reason - able considering the almost equal partitioning of FliptR into L d and L o phases 33 , but larger area of L o phase compared to L d , resulting from tension - induced phase separation ( Fig . 5c ) 46 , 47 . Moreover , the absorptivity of the FliptR probe in the L o phase is higher than in the L d phase at the excitation wavelength ( 485 nm ) 2 . Thus , the contribu - tion to the overall lifetime counts in FLIM histograms from FliptR molecules in the L o phase is larger than from those in the L d phase , as seen from the increased photon counts when phase separated ( Fig . 5c ) . Similarly , the decreasing FliptR lifetime with decreasing tension under hyperosmotic stress is explained by a reduction of the phase separation , most probably because of partial mixing of the L o – L d phases 48 , 49 . Conclusion We have reported the use of FliptR as a fluorescent probe that allows reliable imaging of membrane tension in living cells and model membranes by FLIM . The intrinsic dependence of the FliptR response on lipid composition naturally prevents the attribution of absolute values of FliptR lifetime to membrane tension that would be valid for all cells . We provide here calibration curves available to other users for two of the most commonly used cell lines , MDCK and HeLa cells ( Fig . 3d ) . Increasing lifetimes with increasing tension show that FliptR planarizes with an increase in tension . This response is consistent with tension - induced lipid phase separation into more ordered domains with more planarized probes and less ordered domains with more deplanarized probes . These tension - induced domains have been observed previously in model membranes with other techniques 46 – 51 . In cells , the size of the tension - induced micro - domains is probably below detection limits , and they might move too quickly for FLIM imaging . However , the observed overall increase in lifetime with increased membrane tension is consistent with tension - induced domain formation , as in GUVs . FliptR deplanarization due to lowering of lipid packing by ten - sion is observed in ordered membrane phases that do not phase separate in our experimental conditions . The typical value of this response ( Fig . 5b , − 1 . 32 to − 0 . 27 ns m mN − 1 ) is in the range of the response due to phase separation ( Fig . 3d , 0 . 57 – 2 . 38 ns m mN − 1 ) . However , in cells , the contribution of the effects may be very dif - ferent in hypo - and hyperosmotic conditions : in hypoosmotic conditions , the overall change in lifetime was fairly small , whereas dramatic changes in lifetime were observed for hyperosmotic conditions ( Fig . 3b , d ) . This could be explained by the fact that in hypoosmotic shocks , both changes in lipid packing ( Figs . 4b and 5b ) and phase separation ( Figs . 4d and 5c ) contribute to changes in lifetime . As the two effects have opposite contributions , but of the same order of magnitude , they cancel one another , so the overall response is negligible . Under hyperosmotic conditions , however , the lipids relax to their most compressed state , even for small hyper - osmotic shocks . In this case , only changes in phase separation could thus act on FliptR , leading to larger changes in the lifetime with d c b a Initial state Lipid decompression Tail tilting Phase separation Fig . 4 | Possible structural changes of lipid bilayer membranes in response to tension reported by FliptR . a , Initial state where FliptR molecules are partially planarized in the membrane . b – d , With increasing tension , three structural changes could occur : a loosening of the packing with increasing distance between less ordered lipid acyl chains , leading to FliptR deplanarization ( b ) , a tilting and stretching of more ordered acyl chains , which should lead to more compression of the FliptR probe and thus planarization ( c ) , and phase separation , in which case , FliptR molecules are more planarized in the L o phase and less planarized in the L d phase ( d ) .

Contributions from lipid tilting and changes in transmembrane voltage from the response of FliptR to tension could be excluded . FliptR offers an ideal combination of characteristics to accu - rately image membrane tension in live cells . It combines ( 1 ) partitioning into different membrane domains without strong preference 33 ; ( 2 ) negligible disturbance of the structure of the sur - rounding membrane 36 ; ( 3 ) specific labelling of the plasma mem - brane 2 ; ( 4 ) negligible fluorescence in water 2 , 53 , 54 ; ( 5 ) insensitivity to membrane potential . An intrinsic limitation of FliptR is in report - ing lipid packing , which depends on the combination of tension and lipid composition . However , it is difficult to imagine a way other than sensing lipid packing to report membrane tension at the molecular level . Thus , the design of a membrane tension probe insensitive to lipid composition is unlikely . Nevertheless , despite this limitation , FliptR accurately reports membrane tension changes , which occur on a timescale of a few seconds , which are easily discriminated from lipid composition changes , which occur over tens of minutes . It is safe to predict that FliptR will not remain the only tension probe . Established systems to image changes in membrane order such as molecular rotors 21 , 23 – 25 , 28 – 30 or solvatochromic probes 23 , 54 , 55 could also function as tension probes . However , further develop - ment will be required to adapt these molecules to the list of char - acteristics required to measure membrane tension . For instance , sufficient partitioning into the L o membranes is difficult to achi eve 21 , 23 – 25 , 28 – 30 , 56 , as these fluorescent probes disturb the local order of lipids . This study is proposed as an example to encourage fluores - cent probe experts to elaborate on the compatibility of their systems with the imaging of membrane tension . The availability of FliptR opens new opportunities to study cell membrane processes by offering the unique possibility to directly image membrane tension in living cells . We foresee new possibilities in studying the role of membrane tension during cell division , endo - cytosis or cell migration . Preliminary studies focusing on the activa - tion of TORC2 signalling by membrane tension in yeast cells fully support these high expectations , including corroborative evidence for tension - induced phase separation 57 . Moreover , the future design of flipper probes localizing specifically to organelles will enable the community to study intracellular membrane tension , as well as its regulation . Finally , in tissue cells , membrane tension may be a direct reporter of force fields existing in growing tissues . Further studies will determine if the FliptR probe can prove itself a direct way to measure those force fields during development . a 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 b c 5 . 6 5 . 4 5 . 2 5 . 0 6 . 8 6 . 6 6 . 4 6 . 2 τ ( n s ) τ ( n s ) σ ( mN m – 1 ) POPC : SM : CL ( 57 : 14 : 29 ) SM : CL ( 70 : 30 ) 4 . 8 4 . 6 4 . 4 4 . 2 3 4 5 6 7 τ ( ns ) 80 60 40 20 0 E v en t s ( 10 3 ) 100 d Iso Hyper 7 µ m τ ( n s ) 5 . 0 Low tension High tension 5 µ m 6 . 2 3 . 0 3 4 5 6 τ ( ns ) 200 150 100 50 0 E v en t s 5 . 5 4 . 0 2 . 0 5 . 5 Low tension High tension Iso Hyper Lo w t en s i on H i gh t en s i on Fig . 5 | Response of FliptR lifetime to membrane tension in GuVs with and without phase separation induced by micropipette aspiration . a , Schematics of the micropipette tube pulling assay . b , FLIM images and dependence of lifetimes τ 1 on membrane tension σ for SM / CL 70 : 30 ( red triangles , slope = − 1 . 32 ± 0 . 19 ns m mN – 1 , N = 6 GUVs ) and POPC : SM : CL 57 : 14 : 29 ( blue squares , slope = − 0 . 27 ± 0 . 05 ns m mN – 1 , N = 7 GUVs ) . c , Left : FLIM images of DOPC : SM : CL 30 : 30 : 40 GUVs aspirated in micropipettes and undergoing phase separation at high tension .

FliptR probes were synthesized following reported procedures 30 . Analytical data for the final product are identical to reported data and thus consistent with the structure and purity of the mechanophore . GUVs preparation and lifetime imaging . GUVs were prepared by the electroformation technique . All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids . The lipid solutions used ( 2 mg ml − 1 ) were ( 1 ) pure 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) , ( 2 ) a mixture of DOPC 70 mol % and cholesterol 30 mol % , ( 3 ) N - ( dodecanoyl ) - sphing - 4 - enine - 1 - phosphocholine ( brain sphingomyelin ) 58 mol % , DOPC 25 mol % , cholesterol 17 mol % , ( 4 ) 70 mol % brain sphingomyelin and 30 mol % of cholesterol , and finally ( 5 ) 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( POPC ) 80 mol % , sphingomyelin 18 . 97 mol % and cholesterol 40 mol % . Each lipid solution on CHCl 3 was supplemented with FliptR ( from DMSO solution ) at 1 mol % and 0 . 03 mol % DSPE - PEG2000 - biotin . The lipid solution was spread on indium tin oxide ( ITO ) - coated glass slides , previously cleaned with bi - distilled water , EtOH and CHCl 3 . The ITO slides with the lipid was dried by keeping the slides at 30 °C for 2 h . The chamber was assembled using O - ring as spacer , filled with a 297 mOsm sucrose solution and blocked with silicone elastomer . An electric field ( 10 Hz , 1 . 1 V ) was then applied for 2 h at 55 °C for sphingomyelin - containing lipid mixes or at room temperature otherwise . Lifetime imaging was carried out in a flow chamber , as described for osmotic shocks on cells . Before addition of the GUV solution , the coverslip was incubated with avidin ( from egg white , Life Technologies , 434401 ) at 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 for 10 min . The avidin was washed out three times with ddH 2 O , and the flow chamber was filled with 200 μ l of PBS . GUVs ( 5 μ l ) were then flushed in the flow chamber . Once the GUVs started to partially adhere to the surface , to avoid further adhesion , which could lead to GUV bursting , the remaining glass - bound avidin was blocked by flowing BSA – biotin ( 1 mg ml − 1 , Sigma - Aldrich , A8549 ) for 15 min . Lifetime measurements . FLIM imaging was performed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti A1R microscope equipped with a time - correlated single - photon counting module from PicoQuant 58 . Excitation was performed using a pulsed 485 nm laser ( PicoQuant , LDH - D - C - 485 ) operating at 20 MHz , and the emission signal was collected through a 600 / 50 nm bandpass filter using a gated PMA hybrid 40 detector and a TimeHarp 260 PICO board ( PicoQuant ) . SymPhoTime 64 software ( PicoQuant ) was then used to fit fluorescence decay data ( from full images or regions of interest ) to a dual exponential model after deconvolution for the instrument response function ( measured using the backscattered emission light of a 1 µ M fluorescein solution with 4 M KI ) . Data were expressed as means ± s . d . of the mean . The full - width at half - maximum response of the instrument was measured at 176 ps . Supplementary Fig . 1a shows all parameters extracted from the fits of FliptR in various GUV compositions . As similar tendencies were seen for τ 1 and τ 2 , the longest lifetime ( τ 1 ) , obtained by double exponential fits , was used for all subsequent graphs . Optical tweezers tube pulling experiment . Tube pulling tension measurements were performed using a modified version of a published set - up 15 , which allowed simultaneous bright - field and FLIM imaging on an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti A1R microscope . A membrane nanotube was formed by pulling away a micropipette - aspirated GUV , whose membrane was attached to a streptavidin - coated bead ( 3 . 05 mm diameter , Spherotec ) held in a fixed optical trap . The trap was obtained by focusing an ytterbium fibre laser ( IPG laser ) through a × 100 , 1 . 3 NA oil immersion objective ( Nikon ) . Force measurements were carried out by measuring the displacement of the bead in the optical trap with a C - MOS camera ( Pixelink ) with a home - made video recorder and bead tracking software under Matlab . The force F exerted on the bead was calculated from Hooke’s law : F = k Δ x , where k is the stiffness of the trap ( k = 8 . 58 pN pix − 1 W − 1 ) and Δ x is the displacement of the bead from its initial zero - force position . Data processing . Images were analysed and processed with SymPho Time64 and ImageJ . All graphs were constructed with GraphPad Prism 7 . Blender software was used for drawings . Reporting Summary .
