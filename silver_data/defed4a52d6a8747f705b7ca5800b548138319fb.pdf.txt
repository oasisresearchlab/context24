Using the histone locus bodies ( HLBs ) of Drosophila nurse cells as a model , we ﬁnd that Pol II forms long - lived , transcriptionally poised clusters distinct from liquid droplets , which contain unbound and paused Pol II . Depletion of the Integrator complex endonuclease module , but not its phosphatase module or pausing factors disperses these Pol II clusters , leaving HLBs intact . Consequently , histone transcription fails to reach peak levels during S - phase and aberrantly spills over throughout the cell cycle . We propose that clustering sequesters numerous poised Pol II molecules near gene promoters to ensure synchronous and eﬃcient gene activation at desired times . Introduction : Numerous regulators of eukaryotic transcription , including the major RNA - synthesizing enzyme , RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ( 1 – 9 ) ) , co - activators ( 3 , 7 , 10 ) , as well as general ( 7 , 11 , 12 ) and sequence - speciﬁc transcription factors ( 13 – 15 ) , can assemble into membrane - less clusters . These clusters are mostly highly dynamic , short - lived , and exhibit liquid - like properties ( 16 ) . Clustering of transcription regulators is dependent on the multivalent interactions of their intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) and is generally thought to be mediated by liquid - liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) ( 3 , 4 , 10 , 11 , 17 , 18 ) , although LLPS - independent mechanisms could also be involved ( 19 – 21 ) . Since its initial observation , clustering has been thought to facilitate transcription by allowing for the rapid accumulation of high concentrations of regulatory molecules at the target genes ( 22 ) , which is supported by recent observations that artiﬁcially induced clustering of transcription factors is suﬃcient to boost transcription ( 23 – 25 ) . Pol II clustering is mediated by the disordered C - terminal domain ( CTD ) of its largest Rpb1 subunit . Pol II is recruited to transcription sites largely unphosphorylated and is subsequently phosphorylated by CTD kinases at various stages of transcription ( 26 – 29 ) . In vitro , the Pol II CTD alone can partition into hydrogels containing other transcription factor IDRs ( 30 ) , is suﬃcient to form phase - separated clusters ( 31 ) , and can incorporate into co - activator condensates ( 4 ) , all of which are disrupted upon CTD phosphorylation . In vivo , Pol II forms numerous clusters that are liquid - like ( 3 ) , CTD - length dependent ( 31 ) , and correlate with transcription bursts ( 2 , 5 ) . These ﬁndings led to the model that Pol II clustering occurs before transcription initiation whereas transcription - coupled phosphorylation of the CTD releases Pol II from clusters and allows for productive elongation ( 29 – 31 ) . However , whether endogenous Pol II clustering constitutes a regulatory checkpoint in the cellular context remains untested . Here , we leveraged microscopy with genetic perturbations in the Drosophila ovarian nurse cells to investigate the dynamics , assembly , and activation of Pol II clustering at the histone locus and its regulatory roles in transcription . Capturing Pol II clustering at the histone loci of the Drosophila nurse cells Pol II clusters are often short - lived and range in size from diﬀraction - limited to sub - micron in diameters in most cells ( 1 – 9 ) , requiring either cutting - edge microscopic technologies for detection at high spatiotemporal resolution or repetitive synthetic gene arrays for signal ampliﬁcation . The histone loci in the Drosophila ovarian nurse cells ( NCs ) of developing egg chambers provide a unique , natural system for capturing Pol II clustering without the need for either . The NCs are endocycling cells with alternating G and S cycles that can grow to 1 , 000 n ploidy and reach 50 μm or more in nuclear diameter ( 32 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . The most prominent Pol II clusters often reside on the replication - dependent histone genes ( 6 , 8 , 9 , 33 ) , which in Drosophila are present in ~ 100 copies at a single locus ( 34 ) . The histone locus self - organizes into membrane - less subnuclear compartments called histone locus bodies ( HLBs ) ( 35 ) , which form one visible focus per NC in early egg chambers and multiple foci per NC in mid to late - stage egg chambers as DNA copy number increases ( 36 – 38 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . The repetitiveness of the Drosophila histone loci combined with the polyploidy of NCs thus constitute a naturally occurring signal ampliﬁcation platform for imaging Pol II clusters . To image Pol II clustering , we generated a homozygous viable , Halo - tagged Pol II ﬂy line by appending the tag to the C - terminus of the Rpb1 subunit following a previously described CRISPR / Cas9 editing scheme ( 39 ) . Halo - tagged Rpb1 is expressed at endogenous levels , associates with chromosomes , and responds normally upon heat shock ( ﬁg . S1 ) . In NCs from Stage 2 to 9 egg chambers , histone mRNAs are synthesized in S - phase and degrade upon exiting S - phase ( 38 ) . Consistently , micron - sized HLB - bound Pol II clusters ( Fig . 1B ) are observed in all S - phase NCs ( N = 109 ) when histone transcription is active . However , 72 % of G - phase NCs ( N = 150 ) also contain visible HLB - bound Pol II clusters . Since each endocycle lasts for at least 7 hours in NCs ( 32 ) , Pol II clusters must be present for substantial periods outside the window in which histone transcription takes place . To capture this phenomenon in live egg chambers , we used a ﬂy line that expresses both Halo - Rpb1 and a cell cycle marker GFP - CycE ( 32 ) , which localizes to S - phase HLBs ( 35 , 38 ) ( ﬁg . S2 ) . Indeed , Pol II clusters form before entry into S - phase and persist hours after exiting S - phase ( Fig . 1C , movie S1 and S2 ) . The lack of Pol II clusters at the HLBs over a fraction of G - phase is not simply due to dispersion of the HLBs : unlike in tissue - cultured cells or in the early ﬂy embryos where HLBs gradually dissolve during cell division and reform upon mitotic exit ( 8 , 35 , 40 ) , micron - sized HLBs ( marked by HLB scaﬀolding protein Mxc ) are present in all NCs regardless of cell cycle stages ( 36 – 38 ) ( Fig . 1B ) , presumably due to the lack of cell division . This suggests that there must be separate mechanisms controlling Pol II clustering at HLBs from those regulating HLB assembly . Collectively , the HLBs of NCs provide a highly tractable system that enables the observation of Pol II clustering with high spatiotemporal resolution at a native locus whose transcription activation is tightly coupled to the cell cycle . The HLB - bound Pol II clusters do not show hallmarks of CTD - driven LLPS If the formation of HLB - bound Pol II clusters is entirely driven by CTD - dependent LLPS , three predictions should be fulﬁlled : ﬁrst , ﬂuorescent Pol II molecules within clusters should exhibit rapid recovery upon bleaching ( 3 , 4 , 31 ) ; second , treatment with 1 , 6 - hexanediol ( 1 , 6 - HD ) , a chemical suﬃcient for disrupting weak hydrophobic interactions , should dissolve Pol II clusters ( 3 , 4 , 8 , 31 ) ; and third , the propensity of Pol II clustering should increase as the CTD length increases ( 31 ) . Contrary to the ﬁrst expectation , Pol II exhibited little to no recovery by ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) ( Fig . 2A ) . Furthermore , the HLB - bound Pol II clusters survived treatment with 5 % 1 , 6 - HD , unlike P - bodies ( marked by Me31B - GFP ) that were largely dissolved ( 41 ) ( Fig . 2B ) . Finally , to directly compare the clustering propensity of Pol II molecules containing CTDs varying in length and sequence composition , we mated an endogenously HA - tagged wild - type Rpb1 ( HA - Rpb1 WT ) ﬂy line to various FLAG - tagged Rpb1 CTD variants ( 42 ) such that the resulting female progenies have a copy of each Pol II form . The stoichiometric ratios of the FLAG variants to HA - Rpb1 WT at the HLBs do not increase with increasing CTD length , opposite to the prediction of CTD - dependent LLPS model ( Fig . 2C and ﬁg . S3 ) . While we cannot rule out the possibility that LLPS mediates some aspects of Pol II clustering , these observations argue that additional mechanisms must be involved in the formation of Pol II clusters . Nearly all the HLB - bound Pol II molecules are transcriptionally inactive The observation that Pol II clusters are present at the HLBs in the majority of G - phase NCs suggests that a fraction of the Pol II clusters are transcriptionally inactive . To conﬁrm this , we measured Ser2 phosphorylation ( Ser2ph ) levels at HLBs . Ser2ph marks Pol II molecules that have advanced beyond the promoter - proximal regions of genes ( 26 , 28 , 29 ) . Amongst all NCs analyzed , only 2 . 9 % ( N = 448 ) showed visible levels of Ser2ph enrichment over nucleoplasm ( Fig . 3A ) , suggesting that high levels of histone transcription only take place during a tiny fraction of the clustering lifetime . To further validate this , we pulse - labeled egg chambers with 5 - ethynyl uridine ( EU ) to detect nascent transcripts ( 43 ) . Similar to Ser2ph , 3 . 0 % of all NCs ( N = 311 ) contained HLB - bound Pol II clusters with detectable levels of EU incorporation ( Fig . 3B , lower panels ) . The low EU enrichment at the HLBs is not due to insuﬃcient sensitivity : besides HLBs , Pol II forms numerous sub - micron clusters in Stage 10 NCs , a fraction of which showed high EU enrichment ( Fig . 3B , upper panels , blue arrows ) . Finally , to investigate whether transcription elongation is required for Pol II clustering at the HLBs , we treated egg chambers with ﬂavopiridol ( FP ) , an inhibitor of the kinase P - TEFb which deposits the Ser2ph mark and releases paused Pol II into productive elongation ( 44 ) . While FP eﬀectively inhibits P - TEFb as indicated by reduced nuclear levels of Ser2ph ( ﬁg . S4 ) ( 28 , 45 ) , Pol II clusters are not dissolved ( Fig . 3C , movie S3 ) . Together , these data argue that Pol II clustering occurs before pause release , with most Pol II molecules remaining inactive for a substantial period following recruitment to the HLBs . The HLB - bound clusters contain both promoter - proximal paused and unbound Pol II molecules Since the vast majority of HLBs exhibit undetectable levels of productively transcribing Pol II , we next explored the possibility that the Pol II clusters contain promoter - proximal paused Pol II . We reasoned that if we depleted Spt6 or Spt5 , two factors that sustain promoter - proximal pausing ( 46 , 47 ) , paused Pol II should be released into the gene body . In consequence , if the HLBs contained paused Pol II , their Ser2ph levels should increase upon Spt6 or Spt5 depletion . Indeed , upon RNAi depletion of Spt6 or Spt5 , the levels of Ser2ph drastically increased at the HLBs ( Fig . 4A and B , ﬁg . S5 and S6 ) . This suggests that HLB - bound Pol II clusters are at least in part made up of promoter - proximal paused Pol II . The observation of Pol II clusters highly enriched in Ser2ph upon depletion of pausing factors is seemingly at odds with models suggesting that CTD phosphorylation disrupts Pol II clusters coincidently with entry into productive elongation ( 29 – 31 ) . This paradox could be reconciled if upon depletion of pausing factors , Pol II still pauses , but further downstream from the transcription start site . To test this possibility , we pulse - labeled egg chambers with EU and co - stained them for Ser2ph . In control , NCs with detectable levels of both EU uptake and Ser2ph enrichment were rarely observed ( 2 . 6 % , N = 270 ) and instead almost all nuclei lacked both EU and Ser2ph signals at the HLBs . Upon knockdown of Spt6 or Spt5 , we found little EU incorporation at the HLB - bound Pol II clusters despite signiﬁcant increases in the levels of Ser2ph ( ﬁg . S7 ) . This suggests that the promoter - proximal escaped Pol II molecules are stalled further downstream on the template , consistent with recent observations in the case of Spt5 ( 47 ) . Because Pol II levels at the HLBs do not substantially decrease upon disruption of pausing by Spt6 or Spt5 RNAi , we wondered whether other forms of Pol II besides paused Pol II might be present at the HLBs – for instance unbound Pol II , deﬁned here as Pol II molecules recruited to the vicinity of the promoter but not engaged in the pre - initiation complex or subsequent steps . As Pol II molecules transit from the unbound state to early initiation , their levels of Ser5 phosphorylation ( Ser5ph ) rapidly increase ( 26 , 28 , 29 ) . We reasoned that treating egg chambers with the initiation inhibitor Triptolide ( TRI ) should only leave at the HLB stably paused Pol II ( 48 ) , which has higher Ser5ph levels than unbound Pol II . If HLBs are solely constituted of Pol II molecules engaged at 5’ - end of genes in unperturbed conditions , we should therefore observe little change in the Ser5ph : Pol II ratio at the HLB upon TRI treatment . Previous studies on Pol II dynamics showed that TRI treatment either completely abolished Pol II clusters ( 49 ) or led to reduced Pol II intensity at a locus ( 5 ) . Consistent with these observations , the intensity of Pol II clusters at the HLBs drastically decreased irrespective of the cell cycle stages within 35 min of TRI treatment ( Fig . 4C , movie S4 and ﬁg . S8 ) , and this decrease was not due to Pol II degradation ( ﬁg . S9 ) . Despite a decrease in absolute Ser5ph intensity following TRI treatment ( ﬁg . S8 ) , the ratios of Ser5ph : Pol II increased by nearly two - fold after normalizing by nuclear levels ( Fig . 4D ) , suggesting that unbound Pol II molecules are also present at the HLBs in unperturbed conditions . The Integrator endonuclease module is required for Pol II clustering at the HLBs In addition to Spt6 and Spt5 , we also examined if Integrator , a multi - subunit complex involved in promoter - proximal regulation of transcription , mediates Pol II clustering at the HLBs . The Integrator complex consists of a phosphatase module and an endonuclease module and has been shown to have both activating and repressive roles in the transcription of protein - coding genes ( 50 – 53 ) . RNAi depletion of IntS8 , a key bridging subunit connecting the phosphatase module to the rest of the Integrator , ( 54 , 55 ) led to increased levels of nuclear Ser5ph including at HLBs ( ﬁg . S10 ) , consistent with previous studies ( 53 , 55 , 56 ) . However , the intensity of Pol II at the HLBs did not decrease upon IntS8 RNAi ( ﬁg . S10 ) despite increased Ser5ph , suggesting hyper - phosphorylation at the Ser5 residues of the Pol II is insuﬃcient to dissolve Pol II clusters . In contrast to IntS8 , RNAi depletion of the Integrator endonuclease subunits IntS11 or IntS9 resulted in a complete loss of visible HLB - bound Pol II clusters in all NCs starting from Stage 6 ( Fig . 5A and B , and ﬁg . S11 ) . Importantly , the loss of Pol II clusters upon IntS11 or IntS9 RNAi is not simply due to a global loss of HLB structure , as the scaﬀolding protein Mxc and P - TEFb remained present at the HLBs ( ﬁg . S12 ) . Nor is it due to RNAi - induced cell death , as IntS11 RNAi and IntS9 RNAi egg chambers did not show arrested development until Stages 10 and 9 , respectively ( ﬁg . S13 ) . Collectively , these results establish the Integrator endonuclease module , but not its phosphatase module , as an essential regulator for Pol II clustering at the HLBs . Inhibition of P - TEFb stimulates clustering of Pol II in the absence of IntS11 Across the literature , P - TEFb has been proposed to play diﬀerent roles in Pol II clustering . P - TEFb inhibition can lead to the loss of Pol II clusters ( 3 , 5 , 57 ) , which is likely attributed to the blockage in pause release ( 45 ) if a cluster is mainly made up of high levels of elongating Pol II ( 57 ) . In other contexts , P - TEFb inhibition displays neutral ( 4 ) to positive eﬀects ( 2 , 58 ) on Pol II clustering , the latter of which is consistent with the idea that phosphorylation releases Pol II molecules from clusters for productive elongation ( 29 – 31 ) . To explore whether P - TEFb inhibition is suﬃcient to promote Pol II clustering in the absence of the Integrator endonuclease , we treated IntS11 - depleted egg chambers with FP . Treatment with FP stimulated the formation of Pol II clusters , despite displaying lower Pol II intensity compared to the control genotype ( Fig . 5A and B ) . To determine the state of “reclustered” Pol II induced by FP , we compared the Ser5ph : Pol II ratios at the HLBs in control versus IntS11 RNAi NCs for both mock - treated and FP - treated conditions . While treatment with FP increased Pol II enrichment at the HLBs , the Ser5ph enrichment was even greater , resulting in a higher Ser5ph : Pol II ratio indicative of a disproportionate increase in 5’ - engaged Pol II molecules over unbound ones . In contrast , the Ser5ph : Pol II ratio in the “reclustered” Pol II was comparable to that in the mock - treated IntS11 - depleted NCs and lower compared to that in the FP - treated NCs of the control genotype ( Fig . 5A and C ) , suggesting that the “reclustered” Pol II is not simply an accumulation of paused Pol II molecules and consists at least in part of unbound ones . This argues that P - TEFb negatively modulates Pol II clustering separately from its roles in pause release ( 45 ) . Out - of - phase and reduced hyper - induction of histone transcription upon loss of the Integrator endonuclease We next sought to investigate how the loss of Pol II clusters impacts the level and timing of histone transcription . Since Integrator depletion leaves the HLB scaﬀold intact ( Fig . 5 and ﬁg . S12 ) , any subsequent transcription changes should stem directly from the loss of Pol II clustering rather than changes in the underlying HLB structure . To visualize histone expression , we performed RNA ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) against H3 transcripts using highly sensitive hybridization chain reaction ( HCR ) based methods ( 59 ) . Distinct H3 FISH spots can be seen both at the HLBs and in the cytoplasm nearly exclusively in S - phase NCs ( Fig . 6A ) . To determine whether the HLB - bound H3 FISH spots correspond to nascent transcripts , we combined a single probe against the 5’ - end of H3 ( 6 ) in a ﬁrst color with a set of probes against the 3’ - end of H3 in another color , reasoning that nascent transcripts would only be labeled by the ﬁrst probe , while full - length counterparts would be labeled in both colors ( ﬁg . S14A ) . We validated this approach in primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) , in which Pol II is initially paused , and then released at later embryonic stages . As expected , the 5’ - H3 probe labels all PGCs regardless of embryonic stages whereas the 3’ - H3 probe set only labels PGCs at later stages ( ﬁg . S14B and C ) . In NCs , the ratios of the 5’ - to 3’ - H3 probes are comparable at the HLBs and at cytoplasmic foci ( ﬁg . S14D ) , indicating that most H3 transcripts detected at the HLBs are full - length transcripts . Additionally , treatment with FP for 60 min does not eliminate 3’ - H3 signal at the HLBs ( ﬁg . S14E ) , suggesting that full - length histone transcripts likely linger at the HLBs long after transcription terminates . In agreement with a previous study in Drosophila NCs ( 38 ) , H3 transcripts can normally be detected with 3’ - H3 probes in all the S - phase NCs but rarely in the G - phase NCs up to Stage 9 ( Fig . 6A ) . Consistent with a low percentage of NCs showing Ser2ph staining at the HLBs or EU uptake ( Fig . 3A and B ) , S - phase NCs with extremely high 3’ - H3 signal ( z - score > 2 ) were observed in 4 . 5 % ( 9 out of 201 ) of all NCs ( Fig . 6B ) . RNAi depletion of IntS11 or IntS9 resulted in a narrower range of H3 expression , with a reduced higher quantile indicative of decreased levels of hyper - induction and an increased lower quantile compared to control ( Fig . 6B and ﬁg . S16B ) . The latter could be attributed to either increased levels of H3 expression in G - phase NCs , increased percentages of S - phase NCs , or both . To eliminate any potential eﬀects of cell cycle disruption , we focused on G - phase NCs and found that the majority showed aberrant H3 expression upon IntS11 and IntS9 RNAi ( Fig . 6C , ﬁg . S15 and ﬁg . S16C ) . In contrast , RNAi depletion of Spt6 or Spt5 resulted in overall reduced expression but not aberrant expression in G - phase ( ﬁg . S17 ) , suggesting that the leaky expression cannot be explained by the loss of promoter - proximal Pol II molecules . The increased level of H3 mRNA in G - phase upon IntS11 and IntS9 RNAi can be triggered by either aberrant activation of histone transcription or disruption of histone mRNA degradation . We ﬁrst examined the cytoplasmic mRNA levels of the ribosomal protein gene RpL30 and found that it does not display similar levels of increase upon either IntS11 or IntS9 RNAi ( Fig . 6A and D and ﬁg . S16A and D ) , arguing that IntS11 and IntS9 RNAi did not disrupt general mRNA degradation pathways . Since histone transcripts are normally rapidly degraded upon exiting S - phase , and misprocessing of histone transcripts can lead to downstream degradation defects ( 60 ) , we next investigated whether H3 mRNA is misprocessed upon IntS11 and IntS9 RNAi . In Drosophila , histone mRNA 3’ - end processing consists of a cleavage step tightly coupled to transcription termination . Unprocessed histone transcripts can therefore be detected using mRNA FISH probes targeting regions downstream of the H3 pre - mRNA cleavage site ( 35 , 38 ) ( Fig . 6E ) . In control NCs , the downstream H3 probe ( DS - H3 ) detects unprocessed H3 transcripts at the HLBs , consistent with observations in early embryos ( 35 ) . H3 mRNA forms foci in the cytoplasm , which are marked by a probe against the H3 gene body ( 3’ - H3 ) , but not by the DS - H3 probe . The ratios of DS - H3 to 3’ - H3 signals did not increase at the HLBs nor in the cytoplasm upon IntS11 or IntS9 RNAi ( Fig . 6F and G , ﬁg . S16E and F ) , thus ruling out the eﬀects of misprocessing on misexpression . Together , these results argue that the misexpression of H3 in G - phase upon depletion of the Integrator endonuclease is due to aberrant transcription activation . Discussion Transcription activators including Pol II are thought to cluster via multivalent interactions of their IDRs , which in turn might facilitate transcription through mass action ( 22 – 25 , 61 ) . While several recent studies have demonstrated that artiﬁcially induced clustering of transcription activators at some loci is indeed suﬃcient to drive transcription ( 23 – 25 ) , others have also shown that artiﬁcially induced clustering does not activate ( 20 ) or can even repress transcription ( 21 ) . Yet it remains unclear whether artiﬁcial clusters recapitulate the size or organization of physiological clusters , leaving unanswered the question of the function of clustering in the endogenous context . Our observation that endogenous clustering of Pol II at the HLBs can occur without histone transcription argues against the simple model of clustering - facilitated transcription . Furthermore , HLB - bound Pol II clusters do not show hallmarks of CTD - driven LLPS and persist in the presence of hyper - phosphorylation at either Ser2 or Ser5 residues of the CTD . This suggests that clustering must be subjected to additional layers of regulation beyond CTD - phosphorylation - gated phase separation . The identiﬁcation of the Integrator endonuclease module as a regulator of Pol II clustering allows us to test the essentiality of Pol II clustering in normal physiology and reveals opposing functions at the histone locus across diﬀerent cell cycle stages : In S - phase , loss of clustering reduces the level of transcription induction , consistent with models proposing activating functions by increasing local concentrations ( 22 – 25 ) . In G - phase , however , loss of clustering leads to aberrant histone transcription , suggestive of its repressive role in transcription . Hence , we propose that clustering ensures synchronous and robust transcription by enabling the accumulation of large quantities of poised Pol II molecules that can be activated at designated times ( Fig . 7 ) . While we do not know what switches Pol II clusters from the poised to active states , the observation that Pol II clusters are present without active histone transcription argues that the maintenance of Pol II clustering and transcription activation must be regulated separately . Coincidentally , a recent study shows that only a fraction of the Notch transcription hubs can progress to a state of transcription activation upon signaling induction ( 62 ) , suggesting the stepwise control mechanism we observed constitutes a general regulatory architecture . The Integrator endonuclease is required for the promoter - proximal termination of many genes ( 50 – 53 ) but whether it ultimately activates or represses transcription has been a subject of debate . IntS11 can facilitate pause release ( 52 , 63 – 65 ) , presumably by evicting stalled Pol II on genes ; alternatively , it can attenuate transcription by terminating elongation - competent Pol II ( 66 , 67 ) . Recent genome - wide analyses ( 53 , 68 ) revealed diﬀerential eﬀects across various protein - coding genes upon depleting IntS11 , with highly expressed genes showing downregulation and lowly expressed genes showing upregulation ( 53 ) . Mechanisms underlying the diﬀerential regulation remain largely elusive , although it was speculated that IntS11 might preferentially target stalled Pol II at highly expressed promoters where endonuclease activity is more limiting ( 53 ) . Our ﬁnding that the Integrator endonuclease module is an essential clustering regulator oﬀers a possible resolution to this conundrum : depletion of the Integrator endonuclease results in the loss of Pol II clusters but its downstream transcriptional eﬀects may depend on whether the Pol II clusters are activated or poised at the time of depletion : for the highly expressed promoters ( as was the case with the highly activated S - phase histone loci ) where the Pol II clusters are more likely to be active , loss of Pol II clustering would lead to transcriptional downregulation ; for the lowly expressed promoters ( as was the case with all the G - phase histone loci ) , loss of clustering would bypass the regulatory transition from poised to activation , causing aberrant transcriptional activation . Finally , “poised for activation” has long been proposed to be a function of promoter - proximal pausing of Pol II ( 69 – 75 ) . While the Pol II clusters at the HLBs consist of both unbound and paused Pol II molecules , depletion of pausing factors Spt6 and Spt5 did not result in leaky histone expression , suggesting that promoter - proximal pausing alone is insuﬃcient to explain the eﬀects of clustering regulation . In summary , our study presents direct evidence that Pol II clustering is a rate - limiting step in transcription and sheds light on Integrator functions as well as promoter - proximal regulation .

Model for clustering - regulated transcription at the replication - dependent histone loci . Poised and elongating Pol II molecules are marked in blue and orange respectively . Normally , Pol II molecules start to form clusters during the G - phase and remain inactive near promoters until they are licensed for transcription during the S - phase . In the absence of the Integrator endonuclease , clustering - regulated transcription is lost . As a result , Pol II becomes elongation - competent once recruited to the promoters , leading to “leaky” histone transcription in G - phase as well as reduced histone transcription induction in S - phase .
