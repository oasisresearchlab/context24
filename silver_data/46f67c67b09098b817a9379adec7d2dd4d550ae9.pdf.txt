MCR - 10 - 0359 2 Abstract Protein Kinase C ι ( PKC ι ) is an atypical PKC isoform and participates in multiple aspects of the transformed phenotype in human cancer cells . We previously reported that frequent amplification and overexpression of PKC ι were correlated with lymph node metastasis in primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas ( ESCC ) . In the present study , siRNA - mediated silencing of PKC ι revealed that this enzyme was required for cell migration , invasion , and resistance to anoikis . In vivo experiments showed that PKC ι suppression decreased tumor growth in esophageal cancer xenografts and lung metastases in nude mice . At the molecular level , knockdown of PKC ι in suspended ESCC cells caused a decrease in S - phase Kinase - associated Protein 2 ( SKP2 ) which had been reported to promote resistance to anoikis via the PI3K / AKT pathway . AKT phosphorylation was abolished after PKC ι suppression , but AKT activation could be refreshed by PKC ι upregulation , suggesting that PKC ι enhanced cell resistance to anoikis via the PKC ι - SKP2 - PI3K / AKT pathway . Addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented the decrease of SKP2 in PKC ι silenced cells , and polyubiquitin - SKP2 was elevated after PKC ι depletion , showing that PKC ι might regulate the expression of SKP2 through the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway in suspended cells . Furthermore , overexpression of SKP2 in PKC ι - downregulated cells restored its resistance to anoikis . Most importantly , PKC ι expression significantly correlated with SKP2 in 133 ESCC tissues ( P = 0 . 031 ) . Taken together , our data demonstrate that PKC ι promotes tumorigenicity and metastasis of human esophageal cancer and that SKP2 is a candidate downstream effector of PKC ι signaling in ESCC . on June 19 , 2017 . © 2011 American Association for Cancer Research . mcr . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Author manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited .

MCR - 10 - 0359 3 Introduction Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) is one of the most common human malignancies . The prognosis of ESCC patients has not significantly improved , with an average five year survival rate of 10 % – 20 % ( 1 ) . Therefore , exploring the mechanisms involved in the development and progression of this disease is the key to effective treatment . The protein kinase C ( PKC ) family consists of at least 12 distinct lipid - regulated protein - serine / threonine kinases that are involved in multiple intracellular pathways and play pivotal roles in regulating cell proliferation , differentiation and survival ( 2 ) . The PKC isoenzymes are subdivided into three main classes : the cPKCs ( conventional PKCs ; PKC α , β I , β II and γ ) , the nPKCs ( novel PKCs ; PKC δ , ε , η and θ ) and the aPKCs ( atypical PKCs ; PKC ζ and ι / λ ) . Atypical protein kinase C type ι ( PKC ι ) has been implicated in the establishment of cell polarity and cell survival ( 3 ) . PKC ι activity can be regulated by PI3K through PDK1 phosphorylation ( 4 ) and protein - protein interactions with upstream effectors , such as Ras ( 5 ) . PKC ι is reported to be amplified and overexpressed in several human cancers , and its overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis in lung , ovarian and pancreatic cancer ( 6 - 10 ) . We recently demonstrated that PKC ι was frequently amplified and overexpressed in primary ESCC tumors . Moreover , the amplification and overexpression of PKC ι were correlated with lymph node metastasis , which indicates that PKC ι might play a role in ESCC progression ( 9 ) . However , the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of PKC ι in ESCC remain unclear . S phase kinase - associated protein 2 ( SKP2 ) acts as a substrate - specific factor for the Skp1 - Cul1 - F - box ( SCF ) complex that regulates the destruction of multiple important proteins , including p27 , p21 , Rb , and p53 ( 11 - 13 ) . Elevated SKP2 expression is frequently observed in on June 19 , 2017 . © 2011 American Association for Cancer Research . mcr . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Author manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited .

Our recent investigation revealed that SKP2 was amplified and overexpressed in primary ESCC tumors ( 16 ) . Current studies have shown that Cdh1 is a critical E3 ligase that targets SKP2 for ubiquitylation and degradation ( 17 , 18 ) . However , the molecular mechanisms underlying elevated SKP2 expression have not been fully explored . In the present study , we found that PKC ι promoted ESCC cell migration , invasion , resistance to anoikis , growth in soft agar in vitro and tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo . Mechanistically , we showed that PKC ι promoted resistance to anoikis through the SKP2 - PI3K / AKT pathway and that PKC ι regulated the expression of anoikis - related SKP2 via the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway . Materials and methods Tissue Specimens Fresh tissues containing ESCCs and adjacent histologically normal epithelia were procured from surgical resection specimens collected by the Department of Pathology in the Cancer Hospital , Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences , Beijing , China . Primary tumor regions and histologically normal esophageal mucosa from the same patients were separated by experienced pathologists and immediately stored at - 70 ℃ until use . No treatment was received by any patients before surgery , and all patients signed separate informed consent forms for sample collection .

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed as above . PKC ι and SKP2 expression scores were determined according to our previously published papers ( 9 , 16 ) . Statistical analysis The differences in results between groups were compared using ANOVA or Student’s t - test . Data were expressed as mean ± SD . The correlation between PKC ι and SKP2 expression levels was analyzed using the Spearman correlation test . All statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS 13 . 0 Statistical program for Windows . P values < 0 . 05 were considered significant . Results RNAi of PKC ι in EC9706 cells EC9706 cells were used to explore the role of PKC ι in ESCC in the current study because they are an ESCC cell line with PKC ι overexpression ( data not shown ) and high metastatic ability . Two duplex PKC ι siRNAs , targeting sequences in the 3’UTR and the coding region of the PKC ι gene , respectively , PKC ι siRNA - 1 and siRNA - 2 , were chemically synthesized for transient down - regulation of PKC ι expression . After transient transfection for 48 h , Western blot analysis showed that PKC ι siRNA - 1 and siRNA - 2 could both effectively suppress the expression of PKC ι ( Fig . 1B ) . Double - stranded oligonucleotides , synthesized according to PKC ι siRNA - 2 , were inserted into PGCsi . U6 . neo . GFP shRNA expression vectors . As shown in Fig . 3A , PKC ι expression was suppressed in P4 and P8 clones . In this study , we refer to PKC ι stably down - regulation clones as PKC ι RNAi . Parallel experiments were performed using the scramble sequence RNAi clones ( S1 and S2 ) . Stably transfected clones were used for in vivo assays and colony - formation assays . on June 19 , 2017 . © 2011 American Association for Cancer Research . mcr . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Author manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited .

MCR - 10 - 0359 11 PKC ι depletion decreased the motility of ESCC cells Our previous results showed that elevated expression of PKC ι was correlated with lymph node metastasis in ESCC ( 9 ) . Metastasis is a complicated procedure that involves many steps . Migration , invasion , and adhesion are all key components of metastasis , so we examined whether PKC ι is involved in these stages . Haptotactic cell migration assays showed that after PKC ι depletion , fewer cells migrated to the bottom of the chamber , compared to non - silencing and parental cells ( Fig . 1A upper panel and 1C ) . The invasive potential of the PKC ι siRNA cells , as assessed by measuring the ability of cells to transverse a reconstituted basement membrane of Matrigel , was reduced when compared to that of the control cells ( Fig . 1A lower panel and 1C ) . Western blot analysis confirmed the suppression of PKC ι expression in PKC ι siRNA - transfected cells ( Fig . 1B ) . These experiments were repeated three times with similar results . Because the PKC ι - induced increase in migration could be the result of an increase in the adhesion of tumor cells to the substrate , we evaluated the adhesive abilities of three groups of cells by measuring the number of cells attached to Matrigel . No significant differences were detected by MTS assays among the groups ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Thus , knockdown of PKC ι expression drastically suppressed the mobility of EC9706 cells in vitro . PKC ι knockdown promoted cell anoikis via inactivation of the PI3K / AKT pathway We subsequently analyzed whether PKC ι expression affected cell cycle progression or apoptosis . Flow cytometric results showed that PKC ι down - regulation had no effect on these phenotypes ( Supplementary Fig . S2 and S3 ) .

MCR - 10 - 0359 12 lymphoid metastasis ( 9 ) and anoikis is one type of apoptosis involved in tumor metastasis ( 25 ) . The percentage of PKC ι siRNA apoptotic cells was approximately two - fold higher than the control and parental cells by Annexin V - FITC / propidium iodide staining ( Fig . 2B , C ) . To confirm that the results of the siRNA experiments described above were due to the inhibition of PKC ι expression , we expressed human PKC ι as a transgene in PKC ι siRNA cells . In this experiment , PKC ι siRNA - 1 was used to knock down PKC ι expression because it targets the 3’UTR of endogenous human PKC ι mRNA , which makes it possible to reconstitute PKC ι expression in PKC ι siRNA - 1 cells using an exogenous human PKC ι expression construct that lacks the 3’UTR targeting sequence . When a plasmid encoding the PKC ι gene was transfected into PKC ι siRNA - 1 cells , re - expression of PKC ι rescued the ability of PKC ι siRNA - 1 cells to inhibit anoikis ( Fig . 2E , F , G ) , demonstrating a specific requirement for PKC ι in the anoikis - resistance of EC9706 cells . Molecular mechanisms of anoikis resistance have been described concerning several signaling pathways in different cell types . Our previous studies indicated that PI3K / AKT and MEK / Erk are two critical pathways mediating the anoikis of ESCC cells ( 16 , 26 , 27 ) . In this study , we examined the potential effects of PKC ι on the activation of PI3K / AKT and MEK / Erk pathways . After PKC ι depletion and cell suspension , p - AKT expression was down - regulated ( Fig . 2D ) , and no significant differences in p - Erk expression were observed in the three groups . Furthermore , p - AKT expression was suppressed no matter whether PKC ι silenced cells were attached , detached or re - plated ( Fig . 5C , D , E ) . In addition , forced transient PKC ι expression in PKC ι siRNA - 1 cells could activate AKT phosphorylation in all three conditions , demonstrating a specific requirement for PKC ι in AKT activation . on June 19 , 2017 . © 2011 American Association for Cancer Research . mcr . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Author manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited .

MCR - 10 - 0359 13 Knockdown of PKC ι inhibited colony formation of ESCC cells in soft agar and s . c . tumor growth in nude mice To investigate the effect of PKC ι expression on tumor growth , we examined in vitro cell growth rate using MTS cell proliferation assays . No significant changes in growth rate were observed between PKC ι RNAi and scramble sequence RNAi cells ( Fig . 3B ) . By contrast , depletion of PKC ι significantly blocked the ability of EC9706 cells to grow as anchorage - independent colonies in soft agar ( Fig . 3C , D ) . Tumor formation assays in nude mice were performed to investigate the effect of PKC ι expression on tumor growth in vivo . PKC ι RNAi and scramble sequence RNAi cells were inoculated into six nude mice in each group . Both groups developed tumors , but the tumors formed from the scramble sequence RNAi cells grew faster than did the PKC ι RNAi tumors . The mice were sacrificed four weeks after injection . Tumors formed from scramble sequence RNAi cells were significantly heavier than were tumors formed from PKC ι RNAi cells ( P < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 3E , F ) . Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of PKC ι expression in the formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded sections of the s . c . tumors ( Fig . 3G ) . PKC ι inhibition decreased lung metastases in nude mice Given that increased cell migration and suppression of anoikis both contribute to the metastatic potential of cancer cells , we tested whether inhibition of PKC ι would affect the ability of EC9706 cells to metastasize . PKC ι RNAi and scramble sequence RNAi cells were introduced via tail vein into eight nude mice from each group . Eleven weeks after injection , the animals were sacrificed and examined for the presence of lung metastases . In the scramble sequence RNAi group , two mice developed visually observable lung nodules and another two on June 19 , 2017 . © 2011 American Association for Cancer Research . mcr . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Author manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited .

MCR - 10 - 0359 14 mice developed small tumor nodules that could be observed only under the microscope in H & E sections of the lungs . However , no tumor nodules were found either visibly or under the microscope in H & E sections of mouse lungs in the PKC ι RNAi group . Representative lungs and their corresponding H & E staining are shown in Fig . 4A . The average number of lung metastases of the mice injected with PKC ι RNAi cells was significantly lower than that of mice injected with scramble sequence RNAi cells ( P < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 4B ) . These results suggest that PKC ι expression promotes tumor metastases in vivo . PKC ι regulated resistance to anoikis through SKP2 Our previous study suggested that SKP2 was also implicated in PI3K / AKT - mediated anoikis resistance in EC9706 cells ( 16 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that there may be a regulating relationship between SKP2 and PKC ι . Western blot analysis in this study indicated that SKP2 expression did not change in adherent cells after PKC ι knockdown ( Fig . 5A ) but was markedly decreased in detached cells ( Fig . 5B ) . To verify that PKC ι directly controlled SKP2 expression , we transfected vectors encoding the PKC ι gene into PKC ι siRNA - 1 cells , and transfected cells were placed in attached , detached , and re - plated states . Expression of exogenous PKC ι restored intracellular level of the SKP2 protein only in the detached cells ( Fig . 5C , D , E ) , which confirmed that PKC ι could only regulate SKP2 expression in detached ESCC cells . When plasmids encoding the SKP2 gene were transfected into PKC ι siRNA - 1 cells , elevated SKP2 expression rescued the ability of PKC ι siRNA - 1 cells to inhibit anoikis . These data revealed a novel required role for PKC ι - SKP2 signaling in ESCC cells anoikis - resistance ( Fig . 5F , G ) .

Author Manuscript Published OnlineFirst on February 10 , 2011 ; DOI : 10 . 1158 / 1541 - 7786 . MCR - 10 - 0359 15 RT - PCR results showed that SKP2 mRNA level was not changed in detached cells with decreased PKC ι . However , the addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 could prevent the decreased SKP2 protein level in detached cells after PKC ι depletion ( Fig . 6A ) . To further support these results , immunoprecipitation experiments with anti - SKP2 antibody were utilized , followed by immunoblotting with anti - ubiquitin antibody . In the presence of MG132 , the ubiquitin was observed in the SKP2 immunocomplex , and its amount was substantially increased in the PKC ι knockdown group ( Fig . 6B , upper panel ) . Western blot analysis ( Fig . 6B , lower panel ) confirmed PKC ι knockdown and ubiquitination assay loading control . The above results indicate that PKC ι activated AKT phosphorylation and enhanced the intracellular level of SKP2 protein in detached ESCC cells . In addition , recent reports have suggested that the PI3K / AKT pathway regulates SKP2 expression level by one or more unknown mechanisms ( 28 - 30 ) . Based on these data , we hypothesized that PKC ι might regulate SKP2 expression through AKT signaling . To investigate this , we treated EC9706 cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 . As shown in Fig . 6C and D , the loss of p - AKT revealed robust inhibition of PI3K activity . However , inhibition of PI3K activity did not result in decreased of SKP2 protein expression either in attached or detached cells , demonstrating that the PI3K / AKT pathway did not regulate SKP2 expression in our experiment . Interestingly , we found decreased PKC ι protein level concomitant with the loss of phosphorylation by AKT . Correlation between PKC ι and SKP2 expression in ESCC tissues To determine the relationship between PKC ι and SKP2 in tumor tissues , we analyzed their protein expression using an immunohistochemical approach combined with tissue microarray .

MCR - 10 - 0359 16 negative or weak PKC ι and SKP2 expression , whereas 50 ( 37 . 6 % ) of the tumors had more intense staining of PKC ι , and 40 ( 30 . 1 % ) exhibited high SKP2 expression than normal tissues . PKC ι expression was significantly correlated with SKP2 expression in the tumors ( P = 0 . 031 , Table 1 and Fig . 7 ) . Discussion We previously reported that both frequent amplification and overexpression of PKC ι were associated with lymph node metastasis in ESCC , suggesting that PKC ι might play a key role in the progression of the disease ( 9 ) . To evaluate this possibility , we first assessed PKC ι protein expression in a panel of ESCC cell lines . We chose EC9706 cells for the PKC ι functional studies because they were shown to have high PKC ι expression ( data not shown ) and are frequently used in ESCC metastasis research ( 16 , 26 , 27 ) . Previous studies suggested that PKC ι was involved in nicotine - activated migration and invasion of H1299 human non – small - cell lung cancer cells and promoted glioblastoma cell motility and invasion by repression of RhoB expression ( 31 , 32 ) . To explore the effect of PKC ι on ESCC cell migration and invasion , we performed transient transfections with two PKC ι - targeted siRNAs in EC9706 cells . Both PKC ι siRNAs significantly suppressed PKC ι expression and induced both inhibition of cell migration and invasion of ESCC cells . Anoikis , one type of apoptotic cell death due to the loss of cell adhesion , is critical for the regulation of tissue homeostasis in tissue remodeling , development , fibrosis and tumor metastasis ( 33 ) . Here , we showed that decreased PKC ι expression was associated with an increase in anoikis in ESCC cells and that re - expression of PKC ι could reinstate anoikis resistance in PKC ι - silenced cells . We postulate that PKC ι overexpression may help malignant on June 19 , 2017 . © 2011 American Association for Cancer Research . mcr . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Author manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited .

MCR - 10 - 0359 17 cells survive in an anchorage - independent manner , leading to metastasis in ESCC patients . Molecular mechanisms of anoikis resistance have been described concerning several signaling pathways in different cell types . Our previous studies indicated that PI3K / AKT and MEK / Erk are two critical pathways mediating the anoikis of ESCC cells ( 16 , 26 , 27 ) . We revealed that after PKC ι inhibition , AKT phosphorylation was decreased , whereas no difference in Erk activation was observed . Moreover , re - expression of PKC ι could activate AKT phosphorylation . These data indicated that PI3K / AKT signaling was the main downstream target responsible for the protective effect of PKC ι against anoikis in ESCC cells . Interestingly , our recent investigation revealed that SKP2 was also implicated in PI3K / AKT - mediated anoikis resistance in ESCC cells ( 16 ) . We therefore tested the hypothesis that SKP2 may participate in PKC ι - associated anti - anoikis signaling pathways . Our data showed that , in detached ESCC cells , PKC ι repression lowered SKP2 expression , while re - expression of PKC ι in PKC ι silenced cells could enhance intracellular level of SKP2 protein . In addition , SKP2 knockdown did not alter PKC ι protein expression ( data not shown ) , indicating that PKC ι acts upstream of SKP2 . Moreover , elevation of SKP2 can reinstate cellular resistance to anoikis in ESCC cells with PKC ι knockdown . Taken together , these results suggest that in detached ESCC cells , PKC ι overexpression elevates the expression of SKP2 protein , promotes activation of the PI3K / AKT pathway and increases resistance to anoikis in ESCC . PKC ι expression was significantly correlated with SKP2 in 133 ESCCs ( P = 0 . 031 ) , which confirmed the regulation between PKC ι and SKP2 in vivo . To our knowledge , this is the first report that PKC ι is involved in cell anoikis through SKP2 regulation , which extends our understanding of the roles of PKC ι and SKP2 in tumor metastasis . on June 19 , 2017 . © 2011 American Association for Cancer Research . mcr . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Author manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited . Author Manuscript Published OnlineFirst on February 10 , 2011 ; DOI : 10 . 1158 / 1541 - 7786 . MCR - 10 - 0359 18 To explore the possible mechanisms of PKC ι regulation of SKP2 expression , we first determined the SKP2 mRNA level in suspended PKC ι - siRNA cells by RT - PCR and found that the SKP2 mRNA expression was unchanged after PKC ι knockdown . Previous studies had suggested that SKP2 transcription was regulated by several important signaling pathways ( 29 , 34 ) . However , our data showed that PKC ι did not regulate SKP2 at the transcriptional level in ESCC cells . We then postulated that PKC ι might regulate SKP2 expression on the posttranscriptional level . When suspended cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 , the decrease in SKP2 protein expression after PKC ι depletion disappeared , which strongly suggested that PKC ι might regulate SKP2 expression via proteasomes . To confirm this hypothesis , an in vivo ubiquitination assay was performed . The results indicated that SKP2 degradation initiated by PKC ι depletion was mediated via the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway . Cdh1 has been revealed as an E3 ligase that promotes SKP2 destruction ( 17 , 18 ) . Several studies have reported on the relationship between the PI3K / AKT pathway and SKP2 ( 28 - 30 ) . It has been observed that in 293T cells AKT1 phosphorylates SKP2 at Ser 72 , which is required to disrupt the interaction between Cdh1 and SKP2 , and as a result prevents SKP2 degradation by the APC - Cdh1 ubiquitin ligase complex ( 35 , 36 ) . In the present study , we found that PKC ι could activate AKT phosphorylation . Based on previous reports and our data , we hypothesized that PKC ι might regulate SKP2 expression through AKT signaling . However , the addition of LY294002 did not change SKP2 protein level either in attached or detached EC9706 cells , indicating that the PI3K / AKT pathway did not regulate SKP2 expression in our experiments . In addition , co - immunoprecipitation analysis showed that AKT1 did not interact on June 19 , 2017 . © 2011 American Association for Cancer Research . mcr . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Author manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited . Author Manuscript Published OnlineFirst on February 10 , 2011 ; DOI : 10 . 1158 / 1541 - 7786 . MCR - 10 - 0359 19 with SKP2 ( Supplementary Fig . S4B ) . Our previous study found that decreased SKP2 reduced p - AKT expression and that the PI3K / AKT pathway is the downstream target of SKP2 ( 16 ) . Our previous and current data showed that SKP2 acts upstream of AKT , and PKC ι might regulate SKP2 protein degradation through other molecules but not PI3K / AKT pathway . Moreover , Mao et al . co - transfected breast cancer BT - 549 cells with expression constructs encoding V5 - tagged PKC λ / ι and HA - tagged AKT and then assessed co - immunoprecipitation of the transfected PKC λ / ι with AKT . They observed that exogenous PKC λ / ι was present at low level in AKT immunoprecipitates , indicating that PKC λ / ι interacts with AKT in breast cancer cells ( 37 ) . We did not observe PKC ι , AKT1 and SKP2 co - precipitation in detached EC9706 cells in the present study ( Supplementary Fig . S4A ) . These differential observations in our and other experiments might reflect that there exist distinct signaling networks in different cell lines . The detailed mechanism underlying PKC ι regulation of SKP2 through the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway remains to be elucidated . Interestingly , we found that the addition of LY294002 also resulted in a decrease in PKC ι protein level , indicating a possible negative feedback loop between PI3K / AKT and PKC ι that may help to maintain the balance between cell survival and apoptosis . In conclusion , our results provide evidence that PKC ι promotes tumor metastasis through increased cell migration ability and anoikis resistance in ESCC . PKC ι enhances resistance to anoikis via the PKC ι - SKP2 - AKT pathway . The data suggest that PKC ι is a candidate oncogene involved in the progression of ESCC and that SKP2 is a downstream effector of PKC ι signaling in ESCC . on June 19 , 2017 . © 2011 American Association for Cancer Research . mcr . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Author manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited .
