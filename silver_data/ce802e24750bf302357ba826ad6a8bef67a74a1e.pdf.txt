We show that endocytosis of the common (cid:1) c cytokine receptor is clathrin independent by using a dominant - negative mutant of Eps15 or RNA interference to knock down clathrin heavy chain . This pathway is synaptojanin independent and requires the GTPase dynamin . In addition , this process requires actin polymerization . To further char - acterize the function of dynamin in clathrin - independent endocytosis , in particular its connection with the actin cytoskeleton , we focused on dynamin - binding proteins E that interact with F - actin . We compared the involvement of these proteins in the clathrin - dependent and - independent pathways . Thus , we observed that intersectin , syndapin , and mAbp1 , which are necessary for the uptake of trans - ferrin ( Tf ) , a marker of the clathrin route , are not required for (cid:1) c receptor endocytosis . Strikingly , cortactin is needed for both (cid:1) c and Tf internalizations . These results reveal the ubiquitous action of cortactin in internalization processes and suggest its role as a linker between actin dynamics and clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis . Introduction Receptor - mediated endocytosis is an essential function of eukaryotic cells . Although different routes of internalization have been described , the only pathway well characterized to date is the clathrin - dependent one . The current model is that clathrin is recruited to the plasma membrane to form clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . This recruitment is mediated by the adaptor protein AP - 2 or an alternative adaptor ( for reviews see Conner and Schmid , 2003 ; Traub , 2003 ) . AP - 2 interacts with clathrin and recognizes clathrin - coated pits’ localization sig - nals present in the cytosolic tail of receptors at the plasma membrane . In addition , AP - 2 acts as a platform to provide sites of interaction for several proteins important for clathrin - dependent endocytosis , including amphiphysin , AP180 , Epsin , and Eps15 ( Marsh and McMahon , 1999 ; Traub , 2003 ) . Eps15 , via its Eps15 homology domain , also interacts with epsin , synaptojanin , and intersectin and thus plays a pivotal role in clathrin - coated pit formation . Altogether , clathrin , AP - 2 ( or possibly another adaptor ) , and their associated factors constitute the endocytic complex required for clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Traub , 2003 ) . Finally , clathrin - coated vesicle fission is controlled by the large GTPase dynamin ( Hinshaw , 2000 ) . Although clathrin - dependent endocytosis is now well known , its links with actin dynamics have been studied only recently ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ) . These studies have pointed to the key role of dynamin in con - necting endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton ( Orth and Mc - Niven , 2003 ) . Indeed , dynamin is a multidomain protein . Through its proline - rich domain ( PRD ) , it binds Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains present in proteins interacting directly or in - directly with F - actin , such as intersectin , syndapin , mammalian actin - binding protein ( mAbp1 ) , and cortactin ( Simpson et al . , 1999 ; Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ; Kessels et al . , 2001 ; Cao et al . , 2003 ) . These proteins were very recently reported to be involved in clathrin - dependent internalization , but their precise action during endocytosis is still unclear . Glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins , the autocrine motility factor , the TGF - (cid:2) receptor , the (cid:2) chain of interleukin ( IL ) - 2 receptor , toxins , but also viruses , are examples of the growing number of markers taken up by clathrin - independent endocytosis ( for reviews see Gesbert et al . , 2003 ; Nabi and Le , 2003 ; Nichols , 2003 ; Pelkmans and Helenius , 2003 ) . These markers are not found in clathrin - coated pits ; instead they are associated with membrane lipid microdomains enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids , also called “rafts , ” caveolae being a subset of these domains that contain caveolin ( Nabi and Le , 2003 ) . The GTPase dy - namin seems to play an essential role in most clathrin - independent internalization examples reported , but its function in these processes is unclear . However , dynamin is not required for all endocytic pathways , in particular pinocytosis of GPI - anchored proteins can be dynamin independent ( Mayor and Riezman , 2004 ) . Very little is known about the role of actin dynamics in Correspondence to Alice Dautry - Varsat : adautry @ pasteur . fr Abbreviations used in this paper : GPI , glycosylphosphatidylinositol ; IL , interleu - kin ; PI , phosphatidylinositol ; PRD , proline - rich domain ; SH3 , Src homology 3 ; Tf , transferrin . on A p r il 6 , 2009 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 28 , 2004 JCB • VOLUME 168 • NUMBER 1 • 2005 156 clathrin - independent endocytosis . It was shown , in the case of Simian Virus 40 uptake , that dynamin and actin were recruited to the virus - loaded caveolae ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ) . In addi - tion , the requirements for activated GTPases of the Rho family in the uptake of GPI - anchored protein and in the IL - 2 receptor (cid:2) chain entry are in favor of a role of the actin cytoskeleton in clathrin - independent mechanisms ( Lamaze et al . , 2001 ; Sabha - ranjak et al . , 2002 ) . More generally , due to the lack of molecu - lar characterization of clathrin - independent endocytosis , these pathways are far from being understood . The common cytokine receptor (cid:1) c belongs to the type I cytokine receptor family that lack intrinsic kinase activity but recruit molecules that transduce the signal to the cell . The (cid:1) c chain is shared by IL - 2 , - 4 , - 7 , - 9 , - 15 , and - 21 receptors ( Schluns and Lefrancois , 2003 ) . Thus , the (cid:1) c receptor plays a major role in lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation , leading when mutated to X - linked severe combined immuno - deficiency ( Schluns and Lefrancois , 2003 ) . This receptor is rapidly internalized and reaches early endosomes ( Hémar et al . , 1995 ) . Then , (cid:1) c is targeted to late endosomes and lysosomes where it is degraded . Therefore , (cid:1) c endocytosis leads to its down - modulation and thus is involved in the control of signaling pathways induced by the ILs that use it as a receptor compo - nent ( Morelon et al . , 1996 ) . The (cid:1) c receptor contains , in its cytosolic tail , sequences that enable its efficient and rapid en - docytosis independently of the ligand or of other receptor chains ( Morelon and Dautry - Varsat , 1998 ; Yu et al . , 2000 ) . However , the mechanism by which (cid:1) c receptor is internalized is not known . The lack of a classic clathrin - coated pit localiza - tion signal in (cid:1) c receptor and the clathrin - independent uptake of another cytokine receptor member , the (cid:2) chain of IL - 2 re - ceptor , suggested that (cid:1) c endocytosis might be clathrin inde - pendent . In this work , we show that indeed the (cid:1) c receptor en - docytosis is independent of AP - 2 and clathrin and we analyzed the role of dynamin partners that also interact with F - actin . Results Endocytosis of the common cytokine receptor (cid:1) c is clathrin independent The common cytokine receptor (cid:1) ( (cid:1) c ) is part of a subfamily of cytokine receptors and is shared by several members of the family , the receptors for IL - 2 , - 4 , - 7 , - 9 , - 15 , and - 21 ( Schluns and Lefrancois , 2003 ) . When expressed by itself , the (cid:1) c re - ceptor is rapidly and efficiently endocytosed ( Morelon and Dautry - Varsat , 1998 ) . To characterize the endocytic pathway of the (cid:1) c receptor , we made use of a dominant - negative mutant of Eps15 ( E (cid:3) 95 / 295 ) that inhibits clathrin - coated pit formation when overexpressed ( Benmerah et al . , 1999 ) . Endocytosis of (cid:1) c receptor and transferrin ( Tf ) , a marker of the classic clath - rin - dependent pathway , were assessed at the same time in cells cotransfected with genes encoding the (cid:1) c receptor and the GFP - tagged E (cid:3) 95 / 295 . The cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 (cid:4) C with Cy5 - labeled Tf and anti - (cid:1) c monoclonal antibody to Figure 1 . Endocytosis of (cid:1) c receptor is Eps15 independent . Cells transfected with (cid:1) c receptor and a GFP - tagged Eps15 dominant - negative mutant , E (cid:3) 95 / 295 , were incubated for 15 min at 37 (cid:4) C with anti - (cid:1) c receptor and Tf - Cy5 to follow endocytosis . The cells were fixed and permeabilized , and (cid:1) c receptor was stained with labeled antibodies . The cells were ana - lyzed by confocal microscopy and a medial optical cut is shown . The arrowhead indicates a doubly transfected cell expressing the Eps15 mutant and the (cid:1) c receptor . The results were quantified by assessing the percentages of transfected cells having internalized Tf or (cid:1) c receptor ( right , mean of three experiments (cid:5) SD ) . Figure 2 .

The cells were then fixed , permeabilized , stained with labeled second antibody , and observed by confo - cal microscopy . As shown in Fig . 1 , in cells expressing E (cid:3) 95 / 295 , endocytosis of (cid:1) c receptor was not affected , whereas Tf uptake was inhibited in 84 % of the transfected cells . This result shows that (cid:1) c receptor internalization is Eps15 independent . Because overexpression of the Eps15 E (cid:3) 95 / 295 mutant pre - vents AP - 2 recruitment to the plasma membrane ( Benmerah et al . , 1999 ) , this result also shows that (cid:1) c receptor endocytosis is AP - 2 independent . It has been recently reported that some re - ceptors , such as the epidermal growth factor receptor , could be internalized following a clathrin - dependent mechanism , but that AP - 2 was not required for this process and could probably be replaced by other adaptors ( Motley et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , we assayed the role of clathrin in (cid:1) c receptor uptake . For this assessment , we used a siRNA directed against clathrin heavy chain ( CHCsiRNA ) and transfected it twice into HeLa cells as described previously ( Motley et al . , 2003 ) . The (cid:1) c gene was in - troduced with the second round of CHCsiRNA transfection . Western blot analyses of total protein extracts showed that the introduction of CHCsiRNA in these cells resulted in an effi - cient reduction of the amount of clathrin heavy chain , without having a general effect on cellular proteins as seen by probing for a control protein , flotillin 2 ( Fig . 2 A ) . Endocytosis of Tf and of (cid:1) c receptor was assessed in these clathrin - depleted cells . As shown in Fig . 2 ( B and C ) , clathrin depletion did not affect (cid:1) c receptor endocytosis , whereas it inhibited Tf endocytosis ( in (cid:1) 70 % of treated cells ) . Thus , clathrin depletion by siRNA treatment did not affect (cid:1) c receptor uptake . Together , the re - sults obtained with the Eps15 dominant - negative mutant and with clathrin siRNA show for the first time that (cid:1) c receptor is endocytosed independently of clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . (cid:1) c receptor is associated with lipid rafts So far , the receptors internalized by a clathrin - independent pro - cess are at least partially located into lipid rafts at the plasma membrane ( Nabi and Le , 2003 ) . Therefore , we asked if this was also the case for (cid:1) c receptor . To test this we used the fact that raft - associated proteins are insoluble in Triton X - 100 at 4 (cid:4) C and can be furthermore isolated by flotation on a sucrose gradi - ent . Thus , cells constitutively expressing (cid:1) c receptor were frac - tionated by this method , and we observed that (cid:1) c receptor was associated with these membrane microdomains , as well as the raft resident protein flotillin 2 ( Fig . 3 ) . As other receptors inter - nalized by clathrin - independent endocytosis , (cid:1) c receptor is as - sociated with lipid rafts . Endocytosis of (cid:1) c receptor is dynamin dependent Next , we analyzed the involvement of the GTPase dynamin 2 in (cid:1) c receptor internalization . The dynamin family contains three members , dynamin - 1 , the neuronal form , and dynamin - 2 and - 3 that share at least 70 % homology , dynamin 2 being the ubiqui - tously expressed form ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) . Dynamin is necessary for clathrin - dependent endocytosis , as well as for some , albeit not all , clathrin - independent pathways ( Henley et al . , 1998 ; Oh et al . , 1998 ; Lamaze et al . , 2001 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ; Le and Nabi , 2003 ) . To assay for dynamin involvement in (cid:1) c re - ceptor internalization , we made use of a dominant - negative mu - tant of dynamin 2 with an inactive GTPase , Dyn2K44A ( Cao et al . , 2000 ) . Cells were cotransfected with (cid:1) c gene and GFP - tagged Dyn2K44A or wild type . The cells were incubated at 37 (cid:4) C for 15 min with anti - (cid:1) c receptor antibody to follow en - docytosis . They were then fixed , permeabilized , and stained Figure 3 . The (cid:1) c receptor is associated with lipid rafts . Cells stably expressing (cid:1) c receptor were extracted by 0 . 5 % triton X - 100 at 4 (cid:4) C and fractionated on a 36 – 5 % sucrose density gradient and analyzed by West - ern blot . The low - density fraction ( R ) contained lipid raft - associated pro - teins such as flotillin 2 ( Flot 2 ) . The high - density fraction ( S ) contained the bulk - solubilized membrane - associated proteins such as Rab5 . Figure 4 . Endocytosis of (cid:1) c receptor is dy - namin dependent . Cells transfected with the (cid:1) c receptor and GFP - tagged wild - type dy - namin 2 ( Dyn2WT ) or GFP - tagged dominant - negative mutant ( Dyn2K44A ) were incubated for 15 min at 37 (cid:4) C with anti - (cid:1) c receptor to fol - low endocytosis . They were then fixed , perme - abilized , and labeled with second antibodies . Confocal medial optical cuts are shown . The arrowheads indicate doubly transfected cells . The results were quantified by assess - ing the percentage of transfected cells having internalized (cid:1) c receptor ( right , mean of three experiments (cid:5) SD ) . on A p r il 6 , 2009 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 28 , 2004 JCB • VOLUME 168 • NUMBER 1 • 2005 158 with labeled second antibody . In 85 % of cells overexpressing Dyn2K44A , (cid:1) c receptor mainly remained at the cell surface as observed by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 4 ) . As a control , over - expression of wild - type dynamin 2 did not affect (cid:1) c receptor endocytosis ( Fig . 4 ) . This result shows that dynamin 2 is neces - sary for (cid:1) c receptor internalization . Thus , (cid:1) c receptor uptake represents another example of receptor - mediated endocytosis , which is clathrin independent and dynamin dependent . Synaptojanin is not required for endocytosis of (cid:1) c receptor Dynamin has a pleckstrin homology domain that binds phos - phatidylinositol ( PI ) lipids , thereby allowing for its associa - tion with membranes . The PI 5 - phosphatase synaptojanin , which regulates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level in the cell , has recently been reported to be involved in the early steps of clathrin - depen - dent endocytosis ( Malecz et al . , 2000 ; Rusk et al . , 2003 ) . This protein appears to colocalize with dynamin on clathrin - coated pits and vesicles and can interact with various partners of dy - namin and clathrin ( Haffner et al . , 2000 ; Rusk et al . , 2003 ) . Moreover , the fact that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is thought to transduce sig - nals from the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton sug - gests that synaptojanin could have a pleiotropic role in en - docytic processes . Thus , we investigated the involvement of synaptojanin in (cid:1) c receptor internalization . For this investiga - tion , we engineered a siRNA directed against the ubiquitously expressed synaptojanin 2 and transfected it in cells expressing (cid:1) c . In cells treated with synaptojanin 2 siRNA ( SJ2siRNA ) , the amount of synaptojanin 2 was clearly reduced , as shown by Western blot , whereas a control protein , flotillin 2 , was not affected ( Fig . 5 A ) . Cells depleted of synaptojanin 2 with siRNA were allowed to internalize Tf and anti - (cid:1) c receptor an - tibody for 15 min at 37 (cid:4) C . As shown in Fig . 5 ( B and C ) , Tf endocytosis was deeply affected in more than 70 % of siRNA - treated cells , in agreement with published data , whereas (cid:1) c re - ceptor endocytosis was not . Thus , the normal expression of synaptojanin is not necessary for the clathrin - independent pathway taken by (cid:1) c receptor to function . Actin polymerization is required for (cid:1) c receptor endocytosis In the past few years , it has been shown that actin polymerization was necessary for clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ; Merrifield et al . , 2002 ) . However , little is known in the case of clathrin - independent receptor - mediated internalization . We analyzed the effect on (cid:1) c receptor entry of jasplakinolide , a drug - stabilizing actin filament , thereby preventing actin poly - merization . Cells transfected with (cid:1) c gene were pretreated with 1 (cid:6) M jasplakinolide or DMSO , and (cid:1) c receptor and Tf endocyto - sis were analyzed by confocal microscopy . Quantification of the results shows that (cid:1) c receptor and Tf endocytosis were equally inhibited in (cid:1) 65 % of the jasplakinolide - treated cells ( Fig . 6 A ) . Thus , actin polymerization is required for (cid:1) c receptor uptake . Role of proteins that link dynamin to the actin cytoskeleton in (cid:1) c receptor internalization Dynamin is a multidomain protein that is involved at differ - ent steps of clathrin - dependent endocytosis . Whereas its GTPase activity is responsible for vesicle scission , dynamin contains a carboxy - terminal PRD / arginine - rich domain that directly binds to SH3 domains of actin - associated proteins ( Orth and McNiven , 2003 ) . Recent reports have implicated several of these proteins in the classical clathrin - dependent pathway , showing links between this pathway and the actin cytoskeleton ( Schafer , 2002 ) . To further characterize the mechanism of (cid:1) c receptor endocytosis , we focused on dynamin partners . There - fore , we investigated the potential implication of these actin - and dynamin - interacting proteins in (cid:1) c receptor endocytosis . Intersectin is a scaffolding protein belonging to this class of dynamin - binding proteins involved in clathrin - dependent en - docytosis ( Simpson et al . , 1999 ) . Intersectin has an Eps15 ho - mology domain that recruits epsin . Epsin binds AP - 2 , thus link - ing intersectin to the clathrin - coated pathway ( Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ; Sengar et al . , 1999 ) . It also contains five SH3 domains binding to dynamin , synaptojanin , and N - WASP , the latter mak - ing a link with the actin cytoskeleton as it is a potent activator of Figure 5 . Endocytosis of (cid:1) c receptor does not require synaptojanin 2 . ( A ) Cells were trans - fected with the (cid:1) c receptor and with siRNA against synaptojanin 2 ( SJ2siRNA ) or not ( Control ) . Western blots analyses were done on protein extracts from 10 5 cells with anti - bodies against synaptojanin 2 ( SJ2 ) , and against flotillin 2 ( Flot2 ) as a control . ( B ) Cells transfected with the (cid:1) c receptor and with SJ2siRNA or not ( control ) were incubated for 15 min at 37 (cid:4) C with anti - (cid:1) c receptor antibody and Tf - Cy3 to follow endocytosis . The cells were fixed and permeabilized , and (cid:1) c receptor was stained with labeled second antibodies and the cells were analyzed by confocal mi - croscopy . Confocal medial optical cuts are shown . The different images were taken with exactly the same settings . ( C ) The results were quantified by assessing the percentage of transfected cells having internalized Tf or (cid:1) c receptor ( mean of three experiments (cid:5) SD ) . on A p r il 6 , 2009 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 28 , 2004 ROLE OF CORTACTIN IN CLATHRIN - INDEPENDENT ENTRY • SAUVONNET ET AL . 159 the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Hussain et al . , 2001 ) . To test the involve - ment of intersectin in (cid:1) c receptor internalization , cells were cotransfected with (cid:1) c gene and with a dominant - negative mutant of intersectin composed of its five SH3 domains ( IntersecDN ; Simpson et al . , 1999 ) . Tf and (cid:1) c receptor uptake were monitored in doubly transfected cells as described in the previous para - graph and their internalization was analyzed by confocal micros - copy ( Fig . 6 B ) . As expected , 85 % of the transfected cells were deeply affected for Tf uptake . In contrast , no effect was ob - served for (cid:1) c receptor endocytosis ( Fig . 6 B ) . Thus , intersectin is a dynamin - binding protein that does not appear to be necessary for the clathrin - independent endocytosis of (cid:1) c receptor . The protein syndapin , which binds to the PRD domain of dynamin , has also been shown to regulate clathrin - dependent en - docytosis ( Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ) . In addition to dynamin , syndapin also interacts with N - WASP , providing a link with the actin cytoskeleton ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2002 ) . To assay for a putative function of syndapin in (cid:1) c receptor uptake , cells were transfected with the dominant - negative mutant of syndapin 2 ( Sdp2DN ) , composed of the SH3 domain of Sdp2 ( Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ) , and endocytosis of the (cid:1) c receptor was com - pared with that of Tf . In more than 80 % of the cells overexpress - ing this dominant - negative mutant , Tf internalization was inhib - ited whereas endocytosis of the (cid:1) c receptor was not affected ( Fig . 6 B ) . Thus , syndapin is another example of a dynamin part - ner specifically involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Another protein , which links the actin cytoskeleton to endocytosis via dynamin , is mAbp1 ( Schafer , 2002 ) . This pro - tein binds directly to the PRD domain of dynamin on one hand , and to F - actin on the other hand . mAbp1 is colocalized with dynamin in clathrin - coated pits and is involved in clath - rin - mediated endocytosis ( Kessels et al . , 2001 ; Mise - Omata et al . , 2003 ) . Overexpression of the dominant - negative mutant of mAbp1 ( mAbp1DN ) , composed of the SH3 domain of mAbp1 , inhibits clathrin - mediated uptake ( Kessels et al . , 2001 ) . Therefore , we transfected cells with this dominant - neg - ative mutant and the (cid:1) c gene , and assayed for (cid:1) c receptor and Tf endocytosis . As previously reported , Tf internalization was inhibited in more than 80 % of the cells expressing the mAbp1 mutant . However , endocytosis of (cid:1) c receptor was not inhib - ited ( Fig . 6 B ) . Once again , (cid:1) c receptor endocytosis can be distinguished from clathrin - dependent internalization by the requirement for mAbp1 . Finally , the only other known F - actin binding protein that directly binds to the PRD domain of dynamin is cortac - tin ( Orth and McNiven , 2003 ) . As mAbp1 , cortactin contains F - actin binding repeats and a SH3 domain at the COOH terminus that binds dynamin . In addition , it contains an NH 2 - terminal motif ( DDW ) that binds directly to Arp3 to stimulate Arp2 / 3 - dependent nucleation ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2002 ) . Microinjection of anti - cortactin anti - bodies or transfection of the cortactin SH3 domain allowed Figure 6 . Actin polymerization is required for (cid:1) c receptor endocytosis , and intersectin , syndapin 2 , and mAbp1 are not necessary .

( B ) Cells were transfected with the (cid:1) c receptor and either a GFP - tagged intersectin dominant - negative mutant ( In - tersecDN ) , the syndapin 2 dominant - negative mutant ( Sdp2DN ) , or the mAbp1 dominant - negative mutant ( mAbp1DN ) .

In cells treated with cortactin siRNA ( Cort - siRNA ) , the amount of cortactin was clearly reduced , as shown by Western blot , whereas a control protein , flotillin 2 , was not affected ( Fig . 8 A ) . We analyzed the internalization of (cid:1) c receptor and Tf in siRNA - treated cells by confocal mi - croscopy ( Fig . 8 B ) . As shown in Fig . 8 C , both Tf and (cid:1) c re - ceptor endocytosis were inhibited to the same extent ( in (cid:1) 80 % of treated cells ) . Together , these experiments show that cortactin is essential for clathrin - dependent and - inde - pendent endocytosis . Cortactin and mAbp1 , which have sev - eral common features , differ in their ability to bind directly to Arp3 . We asked if the direct interaction of cortactin with Arp3 was important for endocytosis . Cells were cotrans - fected with (cid:1) c gene and with the gene encoding cortactin mutated in the Arp3 binding site ( CortW22A ; Schafer et al . , 2002 ) . More than 80 % of transfected cells were deficient in (cid:1) c and in Tf internalization , as measured by confocal micros - copy analysis and quantification ( Fig . 7 B ) . Thus , cortactin needs to have its Arp3 binding site to participate correctly in these two endocytic pathways . In conclusion , cortactin is the only protein linking dynamin to the cytoskeleton known so far that is involved in both clathrin - dependent and - indepen - dent endocytosis . Discussion A growing number of proteins are internalized independently of clathrin - coated pits and vesicles , revealing the importance of these endocytic pathways . In this paper , we show that (cid:1) c recep - tor is a new marker of clathrin - independent endocytosis . This receptor is associated with lipid rafts and its internalization re - quires dynamin and actin polymerization . In clathrin - depen - dent endocytosis , dynamin has been shown to play an impor - tant role in linking internalization and actin cytoskeleton . To further characterize the role of dynamin in clathrin - independent endocytosis , we examined the requirement of dynamin partners interacting with actin . We show that intersectin , syndapin , and mAbp1 are not required for (cid:1) c receptor endocytosis , contrary to their participation in the clathrin - dependent way . Strikingly , the multidomain protein cortactin is necessary for both clath - rin - dependent and - independent endocytosis . Cortactin is the first identified link between clathrin - independent endocytosis and actin dynamics . We would like to discuss the specificity of action in inter - nalization processes of each dynamin partner tested in this pa - per in light of what is currently known in the literature . The lipid PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binds to several proteins such as epsin , AP - 2 , or dynamin and plays a central role in clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis ( Jost et al . , 1998 ; Ford et al . , 2002 ; Rohde et al . , 2002 ) . Synaptojanin 2 is a phosphoinositide phosphatase that controls the amount of this lipid in the cell . In addition , synaptojanin 2 , via its PRD domain , binds to clathrin - associated proteins endo - philin and amphiphysin ( Hill et al . , 2001 ; Nemoto et al . , 2001 ) . Finally , synaptojanin 2 was shown to play an essential role in the early steps of clathrin - coated pits and vesicles formation ( Rusk et al . , 2003 ) . Altogether , these findings suggest that syn - aptojanin is a component of the clathrin machinery . Therefore , our result showing that this phosphatase is not essential for (cid:1) c receptor uptake is not surprising . Similar arguments can ex - plain why intersectin is not necessary for the clathrin - indepen - dent endocytosis of (cid:1) c receptor . Indeed , this protein contains Figure 8 . Cortactin depletion affects clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis . ( A ) Cells were transfected with the (cid:1) c receptor and with siRNA targeting cortactin ( CortsiRNA ) or not ( Control ) . Western blot analysis was performed on protein extracts from 10 5 cells with antibodies against cortactin and against flotillin 2 ( Flot2 ) as a control . ( B ) Cells trans - fected with (cid:1) c receptor and with cortsiRNA or not ( Control ) were incubated for 15 min at 37 (cid:4) C with anti - (cid:1) c receptor antibody and Tf - Cy5 to follow endocytosis . The cells were fixed and permeabilized , (cid:1) c receptor and cortactin were stained with labeled antibodies , and the cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy . Confocal optical medial cuts are shown . The different images were taken with exactly the same settings . ( C ) The results were quantified by assessing the percentage of transfected cells having internalized Tf or (cid:1) c receptor ( mean of three experiments (cid:5) SD ) . For Cort - siRNA - treated cells , only cells depleted in cortactin were analyzed . on A p r il 6 , 2009 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 28 , 2004 ROLE OF CORTACTIN IN CLATHRIN - INDEPENDENT ENTRY • SAUVONNET ET AL . 161 an Eps15 homology domain that interacts with epsin , a coiled - coil region binding to Eps15 , and finally five SH3 domains interacting with several proteins including synaptojanin ( Eng - qvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ) . Thus , intersectin seems to be a specific player of clathrin - dependent endocytosis . How - ever , a recent paper has shown that this protein was involved in caveolae fission in endothelial cells , suggesting that this pro - tein may also be involved in caveolae - dependent internaliza - tion ( Predescu et al . , 2003 ) . The abundance of caveolae in en - dothelial cells , and their crucial role in transcytosis , coupling endocytosis and exocytosis by rapid and efficient fusion - fission processes , suggested a particular function of caveolae in these cells . This finding might explain the special feature of inter - sectin in this case . Syndapin has been involved in clathrin - dependent up - take ( Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ) . In addition to dynamin , syndapin binds also to synaptojanin . Our results show that syndapin 2 is not required for the clathrin - independent en - docytic pathway taken by (cid:1) c receptor . Altogether , these find - ings suggest that syndapin may be a specific component of the clathrin - dependent endocytosis . Cortactin and mAbp1 have been recently implicated in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Kessels et al . , 2001 ; Cao et al . , 2003 ) . Our study shows that whereas mAbp1 is not required for (cid:1) c receptor uptake , cortactin is involved in this clathrin - inde - pendent endocytosis , as shown by using siRNA and cortactin mutants . These two proteins share a lot of common features . In - deed , both proteins bind directly to F - actin and dynamin ( Orth and McNiven , 2003 ) . In addition , cortactin and mAbp1 are Src kinase targets and are translocated to the cell periphery by the activation of Rac1 ( Weed et al . , 1998 ; Kessels et al . , 2000 ) . However , it is noteworthy that the two proteins have several specific partners . In particular , they differ by the presence of an acidic motif binding and activating Arp2 / 3 complex at the NH 2 terminus of cortactin ( Weed et al . , 2000 ) . Interestingly , we found that a cortactin mutant ( CortW22A ) , which no longer binds Arp3 , inhibits clathrin - dependent and - independent en - docytosis ( Fig . 7 B ) . Thus , the differential effect of cortactin and mAbp1 on (cid:1) c receptor endocytosis can be accounted for by their different properties in Arp3 binding . The results obtained with CortDN and CortW22A mutants suggest that both the SH3 domain and the Arp3 binding domain are important for cortac - tin function , as suggested by in vitro studies ( Schafer et al . , 2002 ) . Cortactin is the only dynamin partner that has been shown to modulate actin dynamics . Indeed , mutations in cortac - tin avoiding its binding to Arp2 / 3 or dynamin decrease the actin dynamics of the cell ( Schafer et al . , 2002 ) . Also , in vitro studies have shown that the complex formed by cortactin , Arp2 / 3 , and dynamin promotes actin assembly ( Schafer et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , cortactin constitutes the strongest link between endocytosis and the cytoskeleton . The fact that a cortactin mutant incapable of binding Arp3 affects both clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis suggests that the action of cortactin is linked to Arp2 / 3 complex and to actin polymerization . Recently , clathrin - dependent endocytosis and caveolae - mediated uptake of Simian Virus 40 have been shown to in - volve actin polymerization at the site of entry ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ) . We have shown here that actin polymerization is also necessary for clathrin - independent re - ceptor - mediated endocytosis of (cid:1) c receptor . Dynamin seems to play a crucial role in the actin cytoskeleton recruitment during endocytosis . The recent results concerning the clathrin - depen - dent uptake have allowed the identification of several dy - namin - binding proteins that could act at the interface between endocytosis and actin dynamics ( Orth and McNiven , 2003 ) . In contrast , nothing was known for clathrin - independent endocy - tosis . However , the central role of dynamin in clathrin - depen - dent endocytic processes prompted us to test the role of ac - tin - dynamin interacting partners in the clathrin - independent pathway used by the (cid:1) c receptor . The majority of the known putative linker proteins seem to be solely involved in clathrin - mediated internalization . Cortactin is the only dynamin partner identified so far that is necessary for (cid:1) c receptor internaliza - tion . Interestingly , the (cid:2) chain of IL - 2 receptor , another marker of the clathrin - independent pathway ( Lamaze et al . , 2001 ) , also requires cortactin to be internalized ( unpublished data ) , sug - gesting a general role of cortactin in clathrin - independent en - docytosis . Thus , cortactin is involved in both clathrin - dependent Figure 9 . Working model for the interface between endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton . A core complex composed of dynamin , cort - actin , Arp2 / 3 complex , and F - actin appears to be involved in both clathrin - dependent and - independent pathways . Cortactin is proposed to play a central role in connecting endocytosis to actin dynamics through dynamin . Syndapin , intersectin , and mAbp1 are actin - dynamin – interacting proteins specifically required in clathrin - coated pits and vesicles formation . on A p r il 6 , 2009 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 28 , 2004 JCB • VOLUME 168 • NUMBER 1 • 2005 162 and - independent uptake . Our work points to an ubiquitous and pivotal role of cortactin in endocytosis . We propose a working hypothesis whereby dynamin , cortactin , Arp2 / 3 , and F - actin constitute a core complex that would link endocytosis to actin dynamics ( Fig . 9 ) . The other dynamin partners , such as syn - dapin , intersectin , or mAbp1 , specific to one endocytic path - way , could play a role in this dynamic process , in association to the core complex or not ( Fig . 9 ) . It is noteworthy that mAbp1 , syndapin , and intersectin might be involved in some way in clathrin - independent uptake ; if so , their role must be less criti - cal than it is for the clathrin pathway . Future work will focus on the precise action of this complex during the different steps of internalization to characterize further the interface between endocytosis and the cytoskeleton .

Cells lysis and fractionation Kit225 cells ( 5 (cid:7) 10 7 ) were resuspended in 0 . 5 ml of ice - cold TBS ( 140 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris , and 1 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 4 ) , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfoxide , and 1 % of inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . After 20 - min incubation on ice , the lysate was passed 10 times through a 26G3 / 8 needle and centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min at 4 (cid:4) C . The super - natant mixed with an equal volume of 80 % sucrose was fractionated on a 36 – 5 % sucrose density gradient ( Lamaze et al . , 2001 ) . Finally , proteins from the 10 fractions were precipitated by TCA and one third was loaded on SDS - PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with either goat anti - (cid:1) c re - ceptor ( 1 : 1 , 000 , AF284 ; R & D Systems ) , mouse anti - rab5 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; BD Biosciences ) , or mouse anti - flotillin 2 ( 1 : 2 , 000 ; BD Biosciences ) . Transfection and siRNA experiments HeLa cells ( 4 (cid:7) 10 6 cells / point ) were cotransfected by electroporation with 10 (cid:6) g of pRCH (cid:1) and 20 (cid:6) g of plasmid encoding the various mutants at 900 (cid:6) F and 200 V ( Easyject ; Eurogentec ) . 24 h later , the cells were re - suspended in DME containing 6 mM Na butyrate to enhance the expres - sion of the mutants , and 24 h thereafter the cells were analyzed by immu - nofluorescence . siRNAs were synthesized by Dharmacon , and the siRNA duplexes were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions to yield a 20 - (cid:6) M final concentration .

We checked that an irrelevant siRNA had no effect on endocy - tosis . The cells were plated to 80 % confluency in 6 - well plates . 10 (cid:6) l of duplexes siRNA or control ( 10 (cid:6) l of TE 1 / 10 : 1 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , and 0 . 1 mM EDTA ) were mixed in 42 (cid:6) l of 250 mM CaCl 2 solution and added to the cells . Finally , 42 (cid:6) l of HBS ( 50 mM Hepes , 280 mM NaCl , 10 mM KCl , and 1 . 5 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , pH 7 . 05 ) were added to the cells . 48 h later , 20 (cid:6) g of pRCH (cid:1) DNA were introduced by electroporation in siRNA - transfected cells , together with 10 (cid:6) l of CHCsiRNA or 10 (cid:6) l of CortsiRNA duplexes , in experiments using these siRNAs . 24 h later , total protein ex - tracts from 10 5 cells were loaded on SDS - PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with an anti - clathrin heavy chain mouse antibody ( BD Biosciences ; 1 : 1 , 000 ) or an anti - synaptojanin 2 rabbit antibody ( 1 : 2 , 000 ; a gift from M . Symons , Center for Oncology and Cell Biology , Institute for Medical Research at North Shore - LIJ , Manhasset , NY ; Malecz et al . , 2000 ) or an anti - cortactin mouse antibody ( Upstate Biotechnology ; 1 : 2 , 000 ) or an anti - flotillin 2 mouse antibody ( BD Biosciences ; 1 : 2 , 000 ) . The secondary antibodies used were alkaline phosphatase - coupled anti – rabbit or anti – mouse antibodies ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) . The Western blots were revealed by ECF ( Amersham Biosciences ) and quantified using a Storm FluoroIm - ager ( Molecular Dynamics ) . Endocytosis , immunofluorescence , and confocal microscopy Endocytosis of (cid:1) c receptor and Tf were performed for 15 min at 37 (cid:4) C as described previously ( Morelon and Dautry - Varsat , 1998 ) using anti - (cid:1) c re - ceptor Tugh4 ( rat antibody ; BD Biosciences ; 1 : 50 ) or MAB284 ( mouse an - tibody ; R & D Systems ; 1 : 50 ) and 50 nM of human iron - loaded Tf conju - gated to Cy5 or Cy3 ( Lamaze et al . , 2001 ) . In Fig . 6 A , HeLa cells were pretreated for 45 min at 37 (cid:4) C with either DMSO ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) or Jasplakino - lide ( 1 (cid:6) M ; Molecular Probes ) . Immunofluorescence experiments were per - formed as described previously ( Morelon and Dautry - Varsat , 1998 ) with anti - Xpress ( mouse antibody ; Invitrogen ; 1 : 500 ) , anti - myc ( mouse anti - body 9E10 , ascites 1 : 500 ) , anti - flagM5 ( mouse antibody ; Sigma - Aldrich ; 1 : 100 ) , or anti - cortactin mouse antibody ( Upstate Biotechnology ; 1 : 200 ) .
