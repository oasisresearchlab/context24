Homologous DNA sequences were collected from Genbank for several pairs of species using Entrez ( www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / Entrez / ) . Species were chosen for which estimates of the evo - lutionary divergence date were available from the literature that were not based on a global molecular clock . For mouse / rat , we used the data set described in W . Makalowski and M . S . Boguski [ Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . U . S . A . 95 , 9407 ( 1998 ) ] . Sequences were aligned as described in ( 9 ) . For each pair of genes , we calcu - lated the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution . To calculate the rate of synonymous substitution , we only used codons that did not differ by a nonsynonymous substitution . We estimated the rate of transition ( K ts4 ) and transversion ( K tv ) substi - tution at fourfold degenerate codons using the meth - od of K . Tamura [ Mol . Biol . Evol . 9 , 678 ( 1992 ) ] , and the rate of transition ( K ts2 ) substitution at twofold degenerate codons using the method of M . G . Bul - mer , K . H . Wolfe , and P . M . Sharp [ Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . U . S . A . 88 , 5974 ( 1991 ) ] . These methods take into account base composition bias . For each gene , we then calculated an overall rate of synonymous tran - sition substitution ( K ts ) by taking a weighted ( by the number of sites ) average of the two - and fourfold transition rates , and an overall rate of synonymous substitution ( K s ) by summing K ts and K tv . The non - synonymous substitution rate per codon was calcu - lated as K n 5 2 ln ( 1 2 P n ) , where P n is the proportion of amino acids that differ between the two sequences . For each pair of homologous sequences , we calculated the average proportion of transitions ( N ts ) and trans - versions ( N tv ) that would change an amino acid . The genomic amino acid ( M ) and deleterious ( U ) mutation rates were calculated as M 5 Z ( K ts N ts 1 K tv N tv ) , and U 5 M 2 ZK # n / 3 , where averages were unweighted averages across genes and Z is a constant that converts the per site estimate to a per genome per generation estimate : e . g . , for human / chimpanzee , Z 5 2 ( ge - nomes ) 3 80 , 000 ( genes ) 3 1500 ( base pairs for a gene ) 3 25 ( years for a generation ) / [ 12 3 10 6 ( years of divergence ) ] . In the D . melanogaster / D . pseudoob - scura comparison , we restricted our analysis to genes that were greater than 500 base pairs ( bp ) in length , since the divergence was relatively high ( Table 1 ) , and synonymous sites were close to saturation , leading to dif(cid:222)culty in accurately inferring K ts ; unfortunately , we were still unable to estimate K ts for two genes , G6PD2 and tpi ; these genes were not analyzed . 11 . The synonymous substitution rate is correlated to the level of synonymous codon bias in some Drosophila species . This may be due to selection on synonymous codon use or a downward bias in the methods used to correct for multiple hits in sequences with high codon bias . To correct our mutation rate estimates , we calcu - lated the average ( across the two species ) x L value for each gene , where x L is the departure from expected codon usage assuming no codon bias calculated as a weighted x 2 statistic [ D . C . Shields , P . M . Sharp , D . G . Higgins , F . Wright , Mol . Biol . Evol . 5 , 704 ( 1988 ) ] , summed over amino acids , assuming an empirical genomic G and C base content of 40 % . We then regressed the estimates of M and U obtained from each gene against the average x L value taking the y inter - cepts as our corrected M and U values ; these are the predicted values of M or U for no synonymous codon bias . 12 .

Hahn 1 † Signaling proteins are thought to be tightly regulated spatially and temporally in order to generate speci(cid:222)c and localized effects . For Rac and other small guanosine triphosphatases , binding to guanosine triphosphate leads to inter - action with downstream targets and regulates subcellular localization . A meth - od called FLAIR ( (cid:223)uorescence activation indicator for Rho proteins ) was de - veloped to quantify the spatio - temporal dynamics of the Rac1 nucleotide state in living cells . FLAIR revealed precise spatial control of growth factor—induced Rac activation , in membrane ruf(cid:223)es and in a gradient of activation at the leading edge of motile cells . FLAIR exempli(cid:222)es a generally applicable approach for examining spatio - temporal control of protein activity . Rac is a member of the Ras superfamily of small guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) pro - teins ( 1 ) and plays a critical role in diverse processes , such as control of cell morphology , actin dynamics , transcriptional activation , and apoptosis signaling ( 2 ) . The broad range of events controlled by this GTPase requires reg - ulation of its interactions with multiple down - stream targets . The effects of Rac may in part be controlled by regulating the subcellular lo - calization of its activation . GTP exchange fac - tors ( GEFs ) , which regulate nucleotide ex - change on Rho GTPases , contain a variety of localization domains and may modulate down - stream signaling from Rac ( 3 ) . Rac induces localized actin rearrangements to generate po - larized morphological changes ( 4 ) , but it has been difficult to explore how Rac activation produces localized actin behavior in an intact cell . We developed a method based on fluores - cence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) that quantifies the timing and location of Rac acti - vation in living cells . Here , it was used to study activation of the Rac1 isoform in cell motility and extracellular signal - induced cytoskeletal changes . Sensing the Rac nucleotide state required introducing a fluorescently labeled biosensor into a cell together with a fusion protein com - prising Rac and green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) ( Fig . 1A ) ( 5 ) . This protein biosensor was labeled with the acceptor dye Alexa 546 , which can undergo FRET with GFP .

Because the p21 - binding domain ( PBD ) contains no na - tive cysteines , a cysteine residue could be in - troduced at its NH 2 - terminus and then labeled with the cysteine - selective iodoacetamide dye Alexa 546 . The distance between the Alexa dye at the NH 2 - terminus of PBD and the fluoro - phore in GFP was calculated to be 52 Å , on the basis of the efficiency of FRET and assuming random rotation of the fluorophores ( Ro 5 51 , n 5 1 / 4 , k 2 5 2 / 3 ) ( 8 ) . When cells expressing GFP - Rac are injected with the biosensor , the changing location of GFP - Rac and the sub - population of GFP - Rac molecules in the acti - vated , GTP - bound state can be mapped simul - taneously . FRET is proportional to the amount of GTP binding , allowing quantitation of changing activation levels . The name FLAIR ( fluorescent activation indicator for Rho pro - teins ) refers to this live - cell imaging technique . FRET between the purified proteins Alexa - PBD and GFP - Rac in vitro was efficient and dependent on GTP - Rac binding . Using fluo - rescence excitation wavelengths that selec - tively excite GFP ( 480 nm ) , fluorescence emission was monitored while maintaining a fixed concentration of GFP - Rac and varying Alexa - PBD concentrations ( Fig . 1B ) ( 9 ) . Binding of Alexa - PBD to GFP - Rac result - ed in a change in fluorescence intensity of both donor ( GFP ) and acceptor ( Alexa ) emission . FRET caused the Alexa ( accep - tor ) emission to increase while the GFP ( donor ) emission decreased . The ratio of emission at these two wavelengths is a sensitive measure of the PBD - Rac interac - tion . The corrected Alexa / GFP emission ratio ( 9 ) exhibited a fourfold change upon saturation of Rac with GTP ( Fig . 1C ) . Flu - orescence emission changed by , 10 % when unlabeled PBD or Rac were used under the same conditions ( 10 ) , and com - petition with unlabeled PBD blocked FRET ( Fig . 1B ; inset ) . Change in emission ratio ver - sus PBD concentration was fit to the Michaelis equation to derive an apparent dissociation con - stant ( K d ) for PBD - Rac binding of 1 . 1 6 0 . 3 m M ( Fig . 1B , inset ) , slightly higher than the values determined for various unlabeled PAK1 fragments ( 11 – 13 ) . The apparent guanosine 5 9 - O - ( 3 - thiotriphosphate ) ( GTP g S ) dissociation constant was determined at saturating Alexa - PBD by fitting the experimental data to the Michaelis equation ( Fig . 1C ) . The derived val - ue of 47 6 9 nM is consistent with the previ - ously reported value of 50 nM ( 14 ) . This vali - dated the application of FLAIR as an indicator of biologically relevant Rac - nucleotide binding . Quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts that are stimulated with either serum or platelet - de - rived growth factor ( PDGF ) initiate mem - brane ruffling and transcription through acti - vation of Rac ( 15 , 16 ) . To monitor the amount and location of Rac activation during this process , the intracellular concentrations of Alexa - PBD and GFP - Rac that altered nor - mal serum - induced ruffle formation were first determined ( 17 ) ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Ex - ogenous proteins were added below these concentrations throughout the studies . Image triplets of GFP , FRET , and Alexa fluores - cence were taken at each successive time point before and after stimulation ( 18 ) to simultaneously monitor both the changing localizations of GFP - Rac and the amount and location of Rac activation ( Fig . 2 , D through F ) . GFP - Rac fluorescence revealed pools of Rac at the nucleus , in the juxtanuclear region , and in small foci throughout the cell prior to stimulation . Confocal and deconvolution im - aging showed nuclear Rac to be concentrated at the nuclear envelope , and expression and immunostaining of epitope - tagged Rac indi - cated that this localization was not an artifact of GFP tagging ( 10 ) . Addition of PDGF or serum led to formation of moving ruffles containing GFP - Rac throughout the cell pe - riphery within 2 min . The FRET images showed a stark contrast between the amount of Rac activation in the ruffles and the nucle - us . No FRET was seen at the nucleus despite the high concentration of Rac there , while the moving ruffles showed the highest FRET , restricted to the ruffle . Thus , Rac activation is Fig . 1 . The Rac nucleotide state bio - sensor . ( A ) Cells expressing GFP - Rac are injected with a fragment of p21 - activated kinase ( PBD ) labeled with Alexa - 546 dye ( PBD - A ) , which binds selectively to GFP - Rac - GTP . The Al - exa and GFP (cid:223)uorophores undergo FRET when brought close together . FRET produces a unique (cid:223)uorescence signal because excitation of GFP leads to emission from Alexa as en - ergy is transferred from the excited GFP (cid:223)uorophore to the nearby Alexa dye ( 30 ) . This FRET can be measured within a living cell to map the distribution and amount of Rac - GTP binding . By imaging the cell with different wavelengths , both the distribution of Rac and Rac activation can be studied in the same cell . GFP excitation and emission are used for overall Rac distribution , whereas GFP excitation and Alexa emission are used for FRET . ( B ) Fluorescence emission from solutions containing 100 nM GFP - Rac bound to GTP g S at different concentrations of Alexa - PBD . Excitation at 480 nm was used for selective excitation of GFP , and direct ( nonFRET ) excitation of Alexa was subtracted from these spectra ( 9 ) . In the absence of Alexa - PBD , the emission from GFP ( peak at 508 nm ) is maximal and no Alexa emission ( peak at 568 nm ) is observed . Binding of Alexa - PBD to Rac - GFP leads to FRET , producing increasing emission at 568 nm and a decrease at 508 nm . The inset shows variation of the 568 - nm / 508 - nm emission ratio as a function of Alexa - PBD concentration for GFP - Rac bound to GTP g S ( circles ) or to GDP ( open squares ) . Addition of increasing concentrations of unlabeled PBD blocks FRET ( open triangles ) . ( C ) Variation of this same emission ratio with changes in the nucleotide state of Rac .

R E P O R T S 13 OCTOBER 2000 VOL 290 SCIENCE www . sciencemag . org 334 restricted to the site of actin polymerization , independent of the overall distribution of Rac . Rac activation remained tightly correlat - ed with the position of the ruffle even as it moved throughout the cell ( 10 ) , indicating that structures specifically associated with the ruffle were either binding and concentrating activated Rac or that growth factor – induced Rac activation was specifically localized to ruffles . FRET was also imaged in cells ex - pressing a GFP fusion protein containing a mutant form of Rho , a close relative of Rac that does not bind PBD . This GFP - Rho Q63L mutant , which generates high levels of GTP - bound protein , produced specific Rho local - izations but no corresponding FRET signals ( Fig . 3A ) . The function of Rac found at the nuclear envelope remains uncertain , but it may be involved in regulating transcription at times later than those tested here , or may be activated for an unknown role by other stim - uli . When activation was concentrated in a small area such as a ruffle , spatially resolved FRET could detect significant activation changes too small to appreciably alter the overall levels of cellular Rac activity . Our data showed that FRET provided much great - er sensitivity and selectivity than following Rac activation simply by imaging Alexa - PBD localization ( Fig . 3B ) . FRET produced much lower backgrounds and provided com - plete selectivity despite the fact that the bio - sensor can bind to multiple proteins ( Alexa - PBD also binds to cdc42 and other Rac iso - forms ) . Although Alexa - PBD could be steri - cally hindered from reaching Rac in some locations , a FRET signal in a given location does reveal that Rac activation is occurring there . Rac is essential for the directed movement of Dictyostelium cells during chemotaxis and Fig . 2 . Rac activation in serum stimulated Swiss 3T3 (cid:222)broblasts . ( A ) To determine the amount of GFP - Rac that induces ruf(cid:223)ing , quiescent cells expressing different amounts of either wild - type or constitutively active Rac ( GFP - Rac Q61L ) [ amount determined on the basis of ( GFP intensity ) / ( cell area ) ] were scored for membrane ruf(cid:223)ing ( 17 , 18 ) . Each point represents an individual cell , placed in the higher ( Ruf(cid:223)ing ) or lower ( Nonruf(cid:223)ing ) row depending on whether ruf(cid:223)ing was induced . There is a GFP concentration below which ruf(cid:223)ing was consistently not induced by expression of wild - type GFP - Rac . Only cells with Rac expression levels below 250 intensity units on this scale were used in biological experiments . The validity of this approach was supported by scoring of GFP - RacQ61L , which showed ruf(cid:223)e induction at much lower levels of expression . ( B ) To determine the amount of intracellular Alexa - PBD that perturbs normal serum - induced ruf(cid:223)ing , cells were scored as in ( A ) . Only cells with Alexa - PBD expression levels below 400 intensity units on this scale were used in biological experiments .

The cells showed highest accumulation of Rac at and around the nucleus before stimulation ( GFP - Rac image ) . Serum addition generated multiple moving ruf(cid:223)es that showed FRET , whereas no FRET was seen at the nucleus before or after stimulation . Nuclear GFP - Rac associated with the nuclear envelope ( see text ) . In the GFP - Rac images , intensities range between 300 and 1100 . The image of FRET before serum addition is scaled to demonstrate the low levels of FRET , with values ranging between 0 and 15 . In the image of FRET after stimulation , the ruf(cid:223)e contains the highest values of 40 to 65 . ( E and F ) Examples of FRET and GFP (cid:223)uorescence in ruf(cid:223)es . Of 35 cells stimulated with either serum or PDGF , 31 began ruf(cid:223)ing within 15 min . FRET was seen in the ruf(cid:223)es of all but one of the ruf(cid:223)ing cells . Nuclear FRET was not seen in any of the cells examined . Fig . 3 . Speci(cid:222)city and sensitivity of FLAIR . ( A ) Swiss 3T3 (cid:222)broblasts were transfected with GFP - RhoQ36L , a constitutively active mutant of Rho ( bar , 22 m m ) , and cells were prepared and imaged as described for GFP - Rac ( 18 ) , with comparable concentrations of GFP - RhoQ63L and Alexa546 - PBD . De - spite a constitutively high propor - tion of GTP - bound protein , the lo - calization of GFP - Rho showed no corresponding FRET . The GFP images show intensities ranging from 10 to 185 , while those in the FRET image range from 0 to 10 . ( B ) Simple lo - calization of Alexa - PBD is inferior to FRET in quantifying and localizing Rac - GTP binding ( bar 5 8 m m ) . The ruf(cid:223)e in Fig . 2D is shown here in close - up , visualized using FRET , or using simple Alexa - PBD localization ( 18 ) . Even though scaling in the Alexa - PBD image is optimized for detection of the ruf(cid:223)e , the high background due to unbound PBD cannot be eliminated , and binding to other target proteins is not eliminat - ed as it is in the highly speci(cid:222)c FRET signal . Without prior knowledge of the ruf(cid:223)e(cid:213)s location , this localization would have been dif(cid:222)cult to discern . Color scale for the intensity of FRET or GFP (cid:223)uorescence is the same as in Fig . 2C .

To determine if Rac activation in polar - ized , motile cells occurred in particular subcel - lular localizations to regulate localized actin behaviors , FLAIR was applied to a monolayer of confluent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts in which a wound was scraped , causing cells to become polarized and move into the open space ( 20 ) . FLAIR revealed highest Rac activation in the juxtanuclear area , and a gradient of Rac activity highest near the leading edge and tapering off toward the nucleus ( Fig . 4A ) . The gradient correlated with the direction of cell movement . The difference in Rac activity between the rear of the cell and the leading edge where activity was highest was examined for 16 cells [ activity mea - sured in squares 3 m m on a side ; percent gradient 5 100 3 ( front – back ) / back ] . Of 16 cells examined , 12 had higher Rac ac - tivity at the leading edge ( gradient of 128 6 51 % , mean 6 standard error ) and four showed a reverse gradient of much smaller magnitude ( 9 6 4 % ) . The gradient was broader than the narrow area at the leading edge where actin polymerization occurs ( 21 , 22 ) . Rac activation over this broad gradient could activate multiple downstream effectors known to be required for motility , to depolymerize fiber net - works for monomer recycling or deliver molecules to the leading edge ( 22 ) . Other studies have shown tight localization of molecules downstream of Rac at the lead - ing edge or in regions immediately behind it to regulate a variety of functions associ - ated with motility ( 23 ) . No Rac activation gradient was seen in cells within the mono - layer , away from the wound edge . Of 10 cells examined , three showed no discern - ible FRET , and seven showed FRET around the cell periphery , either in isolated spots ( four cells ) or uniformly around the edge ( three cells , Fig . 4B ) . The prevalence of Rac activation around the nucleus was quantified in 16 cells . All cells showed both juxtanuclear and nuclear GFP flu - orescence . Of these , 14 showed juxtanuclear FRET , and none showed nuclear FRET . Nota - bly , small areas of the nucleus sometimes showed a FRET signal , but these could be due either to cytoplasmic Rac associated with the nuclear envelope or to juxtanuclear localiza - tions lying over the nucleus . The localization of activation within the juxtanuclear Rac often did not parallel Rac distribution , with “hot spots” of FRET within areas of lower Rac concentration . The meaning of the juxtanuclear Rac localiza - tions is unclear , but their morphology and dis - tribution suggests activation within the endo - plasmic reticulum ( ER ) , golgi , or vesicle pop - ulations , consistent with recent reports suggest - ing an important role for Rac in ER to golgi transport , and in pinocytic vesicle cycling ( 2 ) . Quantifying the spatial distribution of Rac signaling in living cells indicated that Rac activation was tightly coupled to small membrane ruffles , yet was broadly distrib - uted as a gradient at the leading edge of motile cells . This suggests that the cell uses different distributions of activated Rac to produce specific cellular behaviors . Rac and other GTPases are not simple binary switches , but different kinetics of activa - tion produce profoundly different results ( 24 ) . FLAIR may also be used to examine the kinetics of rapid activation changes , and the approach can potentially be applied to many other types of protein behavior . References and Notes 1 . A .

The highest concentration of activated Rac1 was seen in the jux - tanuclear region , and a gradi - ent of Rac activation was also observed , highest near the leading edge and tapering off toward the nucleus . Color scale for the intensity of FRET or GFP (cid:223)uorescence is the same as Fig . 2C . FRET in - tensities are 0 to 18 ( top im - age ) and 0 to 32 ( bottom image ) . In the GFP images , intensities range from 98 to 700 ( top image ) and 100 to 1100 ( bottom image ) . ( B ) Ex - ample of a cell in the mono - layer , away from the wound . In such cells , FRET was either not detected or found around the cell edge . ( GFP intensi - ties 5 0 to 1023 , FRET inten - sities 5 0 to 10 ) .

Alexa - PBD concentrations were either varied as shown , or maintained at 1 micromolar when satu - rating Alexa - PBD was required . The spectra shown were corrected for direct excitation of the Alexa (cid:223)uorophore by acquiring spectra of Alexa - PBD alone at equivalent concentrations , and subtracting these from spectra shown in Fig . 2 . Values for K d were determined by (cid:222)tting to the equation : Y 5 A * X / ( K d 1 X ) . Higher , saturating concentrations of Alexa - PBD were not used because errors from subtraction of direct Alexa excita - tion became larger . The biological activity of GFP - Rac was previously veri(cid:222)ed ( 5 ) . The GFP - Rac used for de - termination of equilibrium constants was shown to be . 98 % active in binding GTP g S , determined as de - scribed ( 26 ) . 10 . C . Chamberlain , data not shown . 11 .

For serum stimulation experiments , Swiss 3T3 (cid:222)bro - blasts ( ATCC , passage 15 through 27 ) were plated on glass coverslips and then maintained in Dulbecco(cid:213)s mod - i(cid:222)ed Eagle(cid:213)s medium ( DMEM ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 1 % L - glutamine , and 1 % penicillin - strepto - mycin for at least 24 hours . Media was then replaced with media containing only 0 . 5 % FBS , and cells were maintained for 42 hours . Cells were transfected by mi - croinjecting 200 m g / ml pcDNA - EGFP - Rac plasmid into cell nuclei 2 to 8 hours before the experiment . The EGFP mutant was used in all experiments , cloned and ex - pressed as described ( 5 ) . Cells expressing the GFP - Rac were then microinjected with 100 mM Alexa - PBD . This concentration produced the appropriate levels of intra - cellularPBD ( Fig . 2B ) afterthematerialwasdilutedwhen it entered the cells . Cells were mounted in a heated chamber on a Zeiss Axiovert 100TV microscope and maintained in Dulbecco(cid:213)s phosphate - buffered saline ( DPBS ) ( Gibco ) to reduce background (cid:223)uorescence . Cells were then stimulated by replacing the media with DPBS containing 10 % FBS or 50 ng / mL PDGF . Images were obtained every 30 s using a Photometrics PXL - cooled CCD camera with 1 3 1 or 3 3 3 binning , and a Zeiss 40 3 1 . 3NAoil - immersionobjective . Fluorescence(cid:222)lters from Chroma were as follows : GFP : HQ480 / 40 , HQ535 / 50 , Q505LP ; FRET : D480 / 30 , HQ610 / 75 , 505LP ; Alexa : HQ 545 / 30 , HQ 610 / 75 , Q565LP . Cells were illuminated using a 100 - W Hg arc lamp . Exposure times for 3 3 3 binning were : GFP , 0 . 1 s ; Alexa - PBD , 0 . 1 s ; and FRET , 0 . 5 s . For 1 3 1 binning , exposure times were : GFP , 1 s ; Alexa - PBD , 1 s , and FRET , 5 s . 18 . Imageswere(cid:222)rstbackground - subtractedandregistered to ensure accurate pixel alignment . The GFP - Rac image was then thresholded , changing the intensities of all pixels outside of the cell to zero . Thresholding was based on the GFP image because it had the largest signal - to - noise ratio , providing the clearest distinction betweenthecellandbackground . ThethresholdedGFP - Rac image was used to generate a binary image with all values within the cell 5 1 and all outside 5 0 . The FRET and Alexa - PBD images were multiplied by the binary image , ensuring that the same pixels were analyzed in all three images . Emission appearing in the FRET image from direct excitation of Alexa and GFP was removed by subtracting a fraction of the GFP - Rac and Alexa - PBD imagesfromtheFRETimage . Thisfractiondependedon the (cid:222)lter set and exposure conditions used . It was determined , as described in detail elsewhere ( 27 ) , by takingimagesofcellscontainingonlyGFP - RacorAlexa - PBD alone , and quantifying the relative intensity of emission in the FRET channel and that in the GFP or Alexa - PBD channel . A broad range of intensities was examined and a line was (cid:222)t to these for accurate determinations . These corrections had to be applied carefully when studying rapidly moving objects such as ruf(cid:223)es . If the ruf(cid:223)e moved between acquisition of the FRET , GFP , or Alexa images , the subtractive correction process would remove light from the FRET image in the wrong place , generating artifactual FRET localizations . Data from moving features were used only when care - ful inspection showed the feature to be coincident in the Alexa , GFP , and FRET images , and controls were performed with images taken in different orders . A low - pass (cid:222)lter kernel was applied to the corrected FRET image to remove high - frequency noise ( 28 ) . Image pro - cessing and microscope automation were performed using Inovision ISEE software . Images were contrast stretched and formated for display using Adobe Photo - shop software . We tested Rac and PBD fused to GFP mutants that undergo FRET ( ECFP and EYFP ) . Unfortu - nately , their spectral overlap was more problematic than that of Alexa and GFP , making the corrections described here more dif(cid:222)cult . In addition , the GFP mu - tants showed roughly 25 % the FRET of FLAIR . We used FLAIR for these reasons , but the ability to monitor Rac activity simply through protein expression may justify using GFP mutants in some applications . 19 . C . Y . Chung , S . Lee , C .

Cells along the edge of the wound were microinjected with 200 m g / ml pcDNA - EGFP - Rac plasmid DNA . Six hours after the wound was formed , cells expressing the GFP - Rac were microin - jected with 100 micromolar Alexa - PBD and allowed ; 10 min for recovery . Media was then replaced with DPBS containing 10 % FBS to reduce background (cid:223)uo - rescence .

An af(cid:222)nity - puri(cid:222)ed antibody to the 16—amino acid peptide demonstrated nuclear staining . Confocal and electron microscopy revealed that nuclear myosin I b colocalized with RNA polymerase II in an a - amanitin— and actinomycin D—sensitive manner . The antibody co - immunoprecipitated RNA polymerase II and blocked in vitro RNA synthesis . This isoform of myosin I b appears to be in a complex with RNA polymerase II and may affect transcription . Myosin I is a single - headed , nonfilamentous member of the myosin superfamily of actin - based molecular motors ( 1 , 2 ) . There are at least four different subclasses of myosin I proteins , all containing a 110 - to 150 - kD heavy chain and one to six light chains . My - osin I is diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm ( 3 ) . It concentrates near cortical surfaces and in the perinuclear region ( 3 ) , and it appears to mediate plasma membrane ex - tension ( 3 , 4 ) , vesicle and organelle transport ( 5 ) , and mechanochemical regulation of cal - cium channels in hair cells ( 6 ) . Affinity - purified polyclonal antibodies to bovine adrenal myosin I recognized a 120 - kD protein that is larger than the antigen ( 116 kD ) ( 7 ) . Confocal and electron microscopy showed cytoplasmic and nuclear staining with these antibodies . Biochemical assays on nuclei dem - onstrated that the 120 - kD protein binds adeno - sine triphosphate ( ATP ) and calmodulin , is as - sociated with K 1 - EDTA ATPase activity , and 1 Department of Physiology and Biophysics , University of Illinois at Chicago , Chicago , IL 60612 , USA . 2 De - partment of Cell Ultrastructure and Molecular Biolo - gy , Institute of Experimental Medicine , Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic , Prague , Czech Repub - lic . 3 Chemistry Department , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA 22901 , USA . 4 Departments of Chemistry and Pathology , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA 22901 , USA . * These authors contributed equally to this paper . † To whom correspondence should be addressed .
