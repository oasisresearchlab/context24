Because the role of actin in membrane organization is not completely understood , we quantiﬁed the relationship between HA and host - cell actin at the nanoscale . Results obtained using superresolution ﬂuorescence photoacti - vation localization microscopy ( FPALM ) in nonpolarized cells show that HA clusters colocalize with actin - rich membrane regions ( ARMRs ) . Individual molecular trajectories in live cells indicate restricted HA mobility in ARMRs , and actin disruption caused speciﬁc changes to HA clustering . Surprisingly , the actin - binding protein coﬁlin was excluded from some regions within several hundred nanometers of HA clusters , suggesting that HA clusters or adjacent proteins within the same clusters inﬂuence local actin structure . Thus , with the use of imaging , we demonstrate a dynamic relationship between glycoprotein membrane orga - nization and the actin cytoskeleton at the nanoscale . INTRODUCTION Cell plasma membranes are widely understood to be later - ally heterogeneous , and membrane - associated proteins can be distributed in complexes and aggregations that span a range of length scales ( 1 , 2 ) . In one cell , a single species of protein can have one subset undergoing Brownian diffu - sion whereas other subsets undergo conﬁned or anomalous diffusion ( 3 ) . Indeed , early evidence from various methods suggested that the lateral mobility of proteins in cell mem - branes could be restrained by forces beyond those of the vis - cosity of the membrane itself , such as those exerted by the actin cytoskeleton ( 4 , 5 ) , and such restraints may help to form or maintain protein clusters by corralling the proteins together between barriers . The idea that the cytoskeleton can organize protein clus - ters or membrane domains by acting as a physical structure that conﬁnes the diffusion of membrane - bound proteins and lipids is long - standing ( 6 , 7 ) , and many studies have emphasized the importance of the cytoskeleton in mem - brane organization ( 8 – 12 ) . Investigators have proposed different mechanisms for the role of actin . Transmembrane ( TM ) proteins bound to the underlying actin cytoskeleton may act as obstacles that restrict the lateral diffusion of other proteins in the bilayer ( 6 ) , clustering of membrane proteins may be promoted by local enrichment of cortical actin ﬁlaments ( 13 ) , or the actin ﬁlaments themselves may act as barriers to lateral diffusion ( 14 ) . Additionally , the actin cytoskeleton can interact with the plasma membrane through actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) such as spectrin , ﬁlamin , and ezrin , and such interactions have also been hypothesized to aid in the organization of membrane pro - teins ( 15 , 16 ) . Discriminating among the diverse range of models that have been proposed to explain how actin can alter the diffusion and cell - surface distribution of mem - brane - bound proteins has proved to be challenging . Although we have gained a considerable understanding of membrane organization with the use of techniques such as Fo¨rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ( 8 ) ) , single - particle tracking ( SPT ( 17 ) ) , and ﬂuorescence recov - ery after photobleaching ( FRAP ( 18 ) ) , the submicron length scale and dynamic nature of whole native mem - brane domains in living cells make these domains unsuit - able for imaging by either conventional light microscopy or electron microscopy . This technical impasse has resulted in a strong need for information about the size range , composition , and dynamic properties of protein clusters in unperturbed cells . Moreover , the precise spatial and dynamic relationships between actin and membrane pro - teins at relevant scales have remained elusive . To investigate membrane organization and its role in viral infection , we studied hemagglutinin ( HA ) , the TM viral fusion protein from inﬂuenza ( 19 ) , expressed in NIH3T3 - HAb2 ﬁbroblast cells . The local concentration of HA on the surface of virions is crucial for inﬂuenza entry via membrane fusion ( 20 ) , and HA concentration on host - cell membranes is crucial for release of bud particles from in - fected cells ( 21 ) . Both of these processes are promoted by Submitted June 8 , 2012 , and accepted for publication March 20 , 2013 . 6 Manasa V . Gudheti and Nikki M .

Intrigu - ingly , inﬂuenza viruses analyzed by mass spectrometry were found to contain b - actin and a number of actin - associ - ated proteins , including coﬁlin , several annexins , tropomyo - sins , and proﬁlin ( 23 ) . Although colocalization between HA and actin on coarse spatial scales has been observed ( 24 ) , direct binding between HA and actin or ABPs ( in the absence of other viral components ) has not yet been re - ported . Rather , HA may inﬂuence actin organization through signaling pathways . For example , the host - cell surface accumulation of HA and its clustering is required for inﬂuenza infection because membrane accumulation of HA triggers activation of the Raf / ERK / MEK cascade via protein kinase C a ( PKC a ) activation and induces export of the viral ribonucleoprotein from the host - cell nucleus ( 25 ) . Our goal in this work was to elucidate the role of the actin cytoskeleton in cell membrane organization , using HA as a canonical membrane - associated protein that is known to organize into nanoscopic and larger scale domains ( 26 , 27 ) . In particular , we focused on the question of how actin mediates HA dynamics and clustering at the nano - scale , using the superresolution method ﬂuorescence photo - activation localization microscopy ( FPALM ) ( 28 ) . Our results reveal how actin distribution and the perturbation of the actin cytoskeletal network affect the membrane orga - nization of this critical viral component—information that can be used to develop new antiviral therapies . Surprisingly , the ABP coﬁlin was excluded from regions within several hundred nanometers of HA clusters , suggesting that HA or adjacent proteins in the same clusters inﬂuence local actin structure . We propose a feedback mechanism that cou - ples the clustering of HA at the cell surface to the distribu - tion of ABPs adjacent to those clusters . This concept can serve as a general model for cross talk between mem - brane - associated proteins and the underlying cortical actin cytoskeleton . MATERIALS AND METHODS For more details regarding the materials and methods used in this work , see the Supporting Material . Constructs pDendra2 - HA ( 29 ) and pPAmCherry - b - actin ( 30 ) ( hereafter referred to as Dendra2 - HA and PAmCherry - actin , respectively ) were based on the pEGFP - N1 vector ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA ) and are described in detail elsewhere . The coding DNA of the hemagglutinin gene of the A / X - 31B ( Puerto Rico / 8 / 1934 - Aichi / 2 / 1968 ) ( H3N2 ) strain of inﬂuenza virus was used in the pDendra2 - HA plasmid . pPAmCherry - coﬁlin ( here - after referred to as PAmCherry - coﬁlin ) was made by cloning human ( non - muscle ) coﬁlin 1 ( NCBI accession number : NM _ 005507 . 2 ) between BamHI - AgeI sites of the pEGFP - pPAmCherry vector . This vector is the same as that used for pPAmCherry - b - actin , with pEGFP replaced by pPAmCherry in pEGFP - N1 ( Clontech ) . Cell culture NIH3T3 - HAb2 ﬁbroblast cells ( NIH3T3 cells that stably overexpress the hemagglutinin gene of the A / Japan / 305 / 57 H2N2 strain of human inﬂuenza virus ( 20 , 31 ) ) were maintained in growth media ( Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ) supplemented with 10 % calf bovine serum ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) andantibiotics ( 100U / mLpenicillinand100 m g / mLstrepto - mycin ; Gibco / Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , and cultured at 37 (cid:2) C in 5 % CO 2 . Superresolution imaging Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies , Invitrogen ) and constructs for ﬂuorescent protein - tagged proteins of interest , plated in eight - well coverglass chambers ( Nalge Nunc ) , and imaged according to established procedures ( 32 ) . Imaged molecules were localized according to established procedures , and the determined coordi - nates for molecules that met thresholds for quality of ﬁt and localization precision were further analyzed for clustering . Nearest - neighbor - based cluster analysis After identiﬁcation and position averaging of molecules visible for more than one consecutive frame , ﬁxed - cell data sets on HA comprised 23 , 120 , 711 localized molecules in NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells . Clusters were identiﬁed by single - linkage cluster analysis ( SLCA ) ( 33 ) . All molecules within a given distance d c of one another were assigned to the same cluster . Using d c ¼ 30 nm , roughly equal to the position uncertainty for the majority of molecules , individual clusters could be identiﬁed from a set of coordi - nates . Similar results were obtained using d c ¼ 40 nm . Cluster morphological properties Given the coordinates of molecules determined to lie within the same clus - ter , the area and density ( number of particles per unit area ) were then deter - mined for each cluster . The area was measured from the shape formed by stamping a circle of radius d c around each molecule in the cluster and taking the area of that continuous shape . The density was calculated as the number of molecules per square micron of area in the cluster . Actin cytoskeleton disruption and staining NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells were incubated with full growth media supplemented with 1 m M Latrunculin A ( LatA ) for 10 min , 1 m M Cytochalasin D ( CytoD ) for60min , 1 m Mjasplakinolide ( Jas ) for30min , or0 . 01 % dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ; control ) for 60 min . Subsequently , the cells were rinsed three times with UV - bleached phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and ﬁxed in 4 % parafor - maldehydeinPBSatroomtemperature ( RT ) for20minbeforebeingrinseda further three times and imaged in UV - bleached PBS . To visualize F - actin , Alexa 488 phalloidin ( Life Technologies , Invitrogen ) diluted 1 : 200 in PBS with 0 . 5 % bovine serum albumin was added to the cells for 20 min at RT . Confocal microscopy An Olympus Fluoview FV1000 microscope was used to image Alexa 488 phalloidin at RT in the confocal mode . Images were obtained using either a 60 (cid:3) / 1 . 2 NA water or a 60 (cid:3) / 1 . 42 NA oil immersion objective with 488 nm excitation and 505 – 525 nm detection . SLCA Molecular positions were analyzed to determine clustering . As described previously ( 33 , 34 ) , the positions of molecules that were within a maximum Biophysical Journal 104 ( 10 ) 2182 – 2192 Actin and Membrane Organization of HA 2183 distance of 30 nm were deﬁned as being within the same cluster . Using an iterative approach , we ﬁrst identiﬁed all molecules within 30 nm of a given molecule and then added those to a list , searched all new molecules added to the list for neighbors within 30 nm , and repeated the process until all members of that cluster had been obtained .

RESULTS HA colocalizes with actin at the nanoscale in both ﬁxed and live cells at 37 (cid:2) C For colocalization studies , we used Dendra2 - HA and PAmCherry - actin plasmids transiently transfected into non - polarized NIH3T3 - HAb2 mouse ﬁbroblast cells ( 20 ) . We previously showed that PAmCherry - actin labels the same ﬁlamentous actin structures as phalloidin in NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells ( 32 ) . In this study , two - color FPALM revealed irregular clusters of HA and actin distributions in both ﬁxed and live NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells ( Fig . 1 ) within 5 0 . 5 m m ( the effective focal depth of this FPALM imaging ) of bottom plasma membranes . Although Fig . 1 shows a striking example of elongated HA clusters , we observed considerable variability in cluster morphology from cell to cell and within cells , with most cells showing both elongated and more compact ( i . e . , globular ) HA clusters , consistent with previously published work ( 26 , 27 ) . Clusters of HA were often spatially colocalized with clusters of actin . Pair correlation analysis with bleed - through correction revealed a strong correlation between HA and actin in live NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells ( Fig . 1 G ; n ¼ 10 cells ) on length scales of ~ 50 nm to > 1 m m . The accumulation of actin and HA together at the bottom membrane raises the possibility that the clus - tering observed here represents projections of unclustered proteins distributed in convoluted membranes . However , evidence provided by electron microscopy imaging of NIH3T3 - HAb2 membranes ( 27 ) indicates that the degree of membrane convolution in these cells is not sufﬁcient to result in the clustering on the scales of hundreds of nanometers to micrometers we observed here with FPALM . We next imaged HA membrane domains and actin in ﬁxed and live cells , and examined the timescale of their persis - tence in live cells . Through FPALM time - lapse imaging ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) , we were able to observe the persistence of HA clusters in living NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells over many tens of seconds . To test whether the actin cytoskeleton was inﬂuencing local HA mobility , we measured the trajec - tories of individual HA molecules and compared them in regions of different actin densities . HA mobility is dependent on local actin density We obtained trajectories of individual HA molecules with a time resolution of 16 . 7 ms by localizing individual Dendra2 - HA molecules as a function of time for several frames ( ranging from two to 23 steps spanning tens to hundreds of milliseconds ) . We then analyzed these trajectories by diffusion analysis ( see Eqs . 1 and 2 in the Supporting Mate - rial ) to determine the mean - squared displacement ( MSD ) per unit time . For Dendra2 - HA expressed alone and imaged in NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells ( n ¼ 29 cells ) , the histogram of turn angles ( deﬁned as the angle between a given step of an indi - vidual molecule and the previous step ) shows biases for angles 0 (cid:2) 5 45 (cid:2) ( i . e . , the molecule continues ahead , 25 . 15 % 5 0 . 07 % of all steps ) and 180 (cid:2) 5 45 (cid:2) ( i . e . , the molecule reverses direction , 29 . 72 % 5 0 . 07 % ) , compared with 90 (cid:2) 5 45 (cid:2) ( i . e . , right turn , 22 . 55 % 5 0 . 06 % ) and (cid:4) 90 (cid:2) 5 45 (cid:2) ( left turn , 22 . 58 % 5 0 . 06 % ; see Fig .

Next , we compared the trajectories of HA molecules in regions of above - and below - median actin density ( see Sup - porting Material for deﬁnitions of each ) in NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells expressing both Dendra2 - HA and PAmCherry - actin . HA molecules in regions of above - median actin density ( Fig . 2 E , red line ) were signiﬁcantly less likely to take two consecutive steps in a given direction ( within 5 37 . 5 (cid:2) of the original direction ; 22 . 2 % 5 0 . 7 % of events ) than HA molecules in regions of below - median actin density ( 24 . 0 % 5 0 . 7 % of events ; Fig . 2 E , blue line ) . Thus , the re - striction of HA mobility was correlated with actin density . Furthermore , we measured the MSDs of individual HA mol - ecules and found that , over tens of milliseconds , the step sizes of HA molecules reduced as local actin density increased ( Fig . 2 F ) . We hypothesized that these trends re - ﬂected multiple populations of HA , with the conﬁnement of each depending on the surrounding actin density . We therefore quantiﬁed the diffusion behavior of labeled HA molecules in live cells . Two distinct populations of HA revealed by particle image correlation spectroscopy In live NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells , particle image correlation spectroscopy ( PICS ) analysis ( 35 ) of individual Dendra2 - HA molecules ( Fig . 3 ) revealed two populations of Den - dra2 - HA with distinct modes of diffusion . One population undergoes free diffusion ( Fig . 3 C ) with D ¼ 0 . 109 5 0 . 066 m m 2 / s ( 74 % 5 7 % of molecules ) and the other ( 26 % 5 7 % of molecules ) shows conﬁned diffusion ( Fig . 3 D ) with D ¼ 0 . 028 5 0 . 018 m m 2 / s within a region of characteristic conﬁnement size L ¼ 150 5 56 nm ( see 100 nm D s t ne v E f ono i t c a r F E C 10 s 20 s 30 s 40 s 0 200 400 600 800 10001200 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 35 A B Actin Density , Molecules / μ m 2 F H A t ili bo m y , μ s / m High Actin Low Actin 0 . 40 0 . 00 0 . 07 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 0 . 04 0 . 05 0 . 06 - 90 0 90 180 270 HA Step Angle ( Degrees ) FIGURE 2 HA mobility differs according to the surrounding actin density .

Trajectories were acquired at 31 . 75 ms / frame and lasted up to ~ 20 frames . ( F ) HA mobility ( as measured by MSD per second ) de - creases with increasing actin density , suggesting that HA motion is restricted by actin - associated structures . Biophysical Journal 104 ( 10 ) 2182 – 2192 Actin and Membrane Organization of HA 2185 Eq . 5 in the Supporting Material for details of the analysis ) . Note that these results do not preclude the existence of more than two HA populations , but suggest that at least two must be invoked to describe the observed distribution of MSDs of HA as a function of time . The conﬁned popu - lation suggests that lateral motion of HA molecules is restricted . Actin regulates HA cluster morphology in nonpolarized NIH3T3 - HAb2 ﬁbroblast cells : native HA cluster morphology We next examined the HA - actin relationship at the scale of a cluster , the biological membrane structure that precedes viral assembly and enables sufﬁcient HA densities for infectivity ( 22 ) . First , we analyzed the positions of 23 , 120 , 711 localized Dendra2 - HA molecules in ﬁxed NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells ( Fig . 4 ) using SLCA ( 33 , 36 ) to quan - tify the cluster area and density ( Table S1 ) . Clusters were deﬁned by a maximum HA - HA radial separation of 30 nm for nearest neighbors within the same cluster . These analyses identiﬁed 22 , 186 clusters of at least 50 localized HA molecules , and 6793 clusters with at least 200 HA molecules ( n ¼ 25 cells ) . Area and density histograms for all HA clusters ( not just those with at least 50 molecules ) are shown in Figs . S2 and S3 . These histograms demon - strate a range of cluster areas from just a few molecules up to nearly 0 . 2 m m 2 and a range of densities from ~ 500 HA / m m 2 up to nearly 10 , 000 HA / m m 2 . As expected from the live - cell data on HA dynamics , elongated and branched clusters of HA were observed in control NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells ( Figs . 2 , A – C , and 4 A ) that sometimes showed distinct angular junctions suggestive of a network of linear structures . Actin cytoskeletal disrupters cause speciﬁc changes to HA cluster density and area If actin mediates HA clustering , then disruption of actin should alter HA clustering . Because HA mobility was found to be restricted within actin - rich membrane regions ( ARMRs ) , we hypothesized that reducing or increasing the density of actin ﬁlaments would alter HA clustering . LatA se - questers actin monomers , thereby inhibiting actin polymeri - zation ( 37 ) . CytoD selectively binds ﬁlament barbed ends and blocks the addition of actin monomers ( 38 ) . These agents can therefore reduce the total amount of ﬁlamentous cellular actin by interrupting actin treadmilling in mechanistically distinct ways . Conversely , Jas binds actin ﬁlaments and inhibits actin depolymerization ( 39 ) , and thus can increase the fraction of ﬁlamentous cellular actin . Confocal images ofAlexa - 488 - phalloidin - labeledNIH3T3 - HAb2cells ( Fig . S4 ) treated with actin disrupters conﬁrmed that stress ﬁbers persisted with Jas treatment but were severely reduced in number with LatA or CytoD treatment , as expected . Confocal imaging of Dendra2 - HA and Alexa - 680 - phalloidin conﬁrmed the colocalization of HA with endogenous actin ( Fig . S5 ) . We characterized the effects of each of these actin - disrupting drugs on the morphology of HA clusters in Dendra2 - HA - transfected NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells ( Fig . 4 ) . 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 35 0 . 00 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 . 10 0 . 12 Δ t ( s ) r 12 ( μ m 2 ) r 22 ( μ m 2 ) 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 35 0 . 000 0 . 002 0 . 004 0 . 006 0 . 008 0 . 010 0 . 012 Δ t ( s ) A B C D 10 μ m 500 nm Free Diffusion Confined Diffusion FIGURE 3 Analysis of trajectories of individual HA molecules by PICS within a living NIH3T3 - HAb2 cell at 37 (cid:2) C shows two populations of HA molecules with distinct mobilities . ( A ) Transmitted light image of a living NIH3T3 - HAb2 cell trans - fected with Dendra2 - HA at 37 (cid:2) C . ( B ) The white box in A shows a region of the plasma membrane imaged by FPALM , in which the trajectories of in - dividual molecules were determined over durations from 16 . 7 ms to 1 . 01 s ( trajectories were between one and 32 steps at 16 . 7 – 31 . 7 ms per step ) . The time dependence of the displacements of the HA molecules was analyzed by PICS ( 35 ) , revealing two distinct populations of HA molecules . ( C ) The ﬁrst population ( 74 % 5 7 % ) had a diffusion coefﬁcient D 1 ¼ 0 . 109 5 0 . 066 m m 2 / s and under - went normal Brownian free diffusion within the un - certainties of the measurement . ( D ) In contrast , the second population ( 26 % 5 7 % ) had a signiﬁcantly lower diffusion coefﬁcient D 2 ¼ 0 . 026 5 0 . 018 m m 2 / s and underwent conﬁned diffusion within a region of size L ¼ 150 5 56 nm . The rela - tionship in D could not be ﬁt with a straight line . Biophysical Journal 104 ( 10 ) 2182 – 2192 2186 Gudheti et al . Clusters were analyzed using SLCA ( see Materials and Methods , and Supporting Material ) , which deﬁnes a cluster as any HA molecules within 30 nm of each other . SLCA ( 34 , 36 ) and pair correlation ( 32 , 40 , 41 ) are complementary methods for quantifying the properties of molecular clusters . The pair correlation provides a probability distribution ( rela - tive to random ) of ﬁnding an HA molecule as a function of radial distance from another HA molecule . The density and size information extracted from pair correlation is an average over many molecules in many clusters . SLCA identiﬁes indi - vidual clusters based on a maximum NN distance , and there - fore can be used to measure the distribution of individual cluster properties ( 34 ) . To quantify the role of actin on HA cluster area and density , we analyzed clusters of HA in cells treated with 1 m M LatA for 10 min , 1 m M CytoD for 60 min , or 1 m M Jas for 30 min , and compared them with HA clusters in corresponding vehicle ( 0 . 01 % DMSO ) - treated controls . The trends for clusters of R 200 HA ( see Table S1 ) and R 50 HA molecules ( not shown ) weresimilar . Eachactin - disrupting drug had speciﬁc effects on areas of HA clusters and the density of HA molecules within them ( Fig . 4 ) . LatA treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the mean den - sity of HA within clusters , but no change in mean cluster area . CytoD induced a signiﬁcant decrease in HA density within clusters and a signiﬁcant increase in mean cluster area . Jas induced a signiﬁcant increase in mean cluster area , but did not alter the mean density of HA within clusters ( Fig . 4 ; Table S1 ) . Together , the results of these actin - disruption experi - ments indicate that actin can mediate the size and density of clusters of the membrane - associated protein HA . Because the ABP coﬁlin has been shown to be important in regu - lating actin structure across various cellular contexts ( 42 – 66 ) , we next examined the relationship between HA clustering and coﬁlin distribution . Coﬁlin is excluded from clusters of HA in NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells Two - color FPALM imaging of Dendra2 - HA and PAmCherry - coﬁlin in transfected NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells ( Fig . 5 ) revealed that clusters of HA were predominantly surrounded by areas of coﬁlin exclusion , spanning hundreds of nanometers to micrometers . This exclusion was not abso - lute , however , and small , dense clusters of HA were some - times colocalized with coﬁlin . Images were taken with an effective focal depth of 0 . 5 m m from the bottom membrane in ﬁxed NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells . Aside from areas within a lateral radius of 1 – 2 m m from HA clusters , coﬁlin was generally distributed diffusely throughout the cells . Quanti - ﬁcation of the pair cross - correlation between HA and coﬁlin revealed , on the average ( n ¼ 14 cells ) , anticorrelation on length scales of ~ 150 nm to > 1 m m ( Fig . 5 D ) . In summary , we show here that domains of the mem - brane - associated protein HA associate with speciﬁc local enrichments in actin , underlying actin can inﬂuence the organization of HA in these domains , and these domains predominantly exclude the ABP coﬁlin . DISCUSSION Imaging of HA clusters demonstrates mediation of membrane protein domains by the actin cytoskeleton on micro - and nanoscales FPALM , which allows one to examine the dynamics of the molecular organization of cell membranes at the nanoscale , was used to image the relationship between actin and HA , a canonical example of a clustered membrane protein relevant to viral infection .

The media for all treatments also con - tained 0 . 01 % DMSO . Scale bar ¼ 1 m m . ( E and F ) Treated cells show signiﬁcant differences compared with controls in terms of ( E ) mean HA cluster area and ( F ) cluster density ( i . e . , number of HA molecules per cluster ) measured for at least 149 clusters per treatment type . Statistical signiﬁ - cance is indicated by a single asterisk ( * p < 0 . 05 ) or double asterisk ( * * p < 0 . 001 ) as reported by Student’s t - test comparing control with treat - ment means . Bars indicate means 5 SE . For details on cluster comparisons , see Table S1 . Biophysical Journal 104 ( 10 ) 2182 – 2192 Actin and Membrane Organization of HA 2187 scales in nonpolarized NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells . In many cases , clustered structures hundreds of nanometers long , contain - ing both HA and actin , were observed at physiological temperatures . On the average , pair correlation analyses suggested an ~ 2 - fold enrichment of HA in regions within 100 nm of actin - enriched regions . Based on the relatively large ampli - tude of the pair correlation ( Fig . 1 G ) from ~ 50 nm to > 1 m m ( compared with that expected for an uncorrelated distribution ) , HA and actin colocalize over a range of length scales . One caveat to this result is that all two - color FPALM distances are measured as a projection onto the x - y plane and do not account for any separation in the axial direction ( z ) other than the coarse discrimination in z due to the depth of ﬁeld ( 5 0 . 5 m m from the focal plane ) . However , based on electron microscopy of the same cell type by serial section ( 27 ) , the z - position variation of the coverslip - proximal membrane does not explain the observed clustering . The use of SLCA enabled us to measure the distribution of HA cluster areas and densities ( the distribution contains far more information than the average cluster size ) . Such data are potentially useful for quantitatively testing physical membrane models of protein clustering , for example , or for determining the fraction of membrane clusters with a mini - mum area or density . Disruption of actin caused HA clusters to change in size and density . The disruptive effect was speciﬁc to the agent being used : LatA signiﬁcantly reduced the densities of HA within clusters ( number of HA molecules / cluster unit area ) , and CytoD signiﬁcantly increased the cluster area and also signiﬁcantly reduced the HA density within clus - ters ( Fig . 4 , A – C , E , and F ) . Although CytoD does inhibit elongation at the barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments , it does not inhibit the de novo nucleation of actin ﬁlaments , and thus it could be expected to have a less stringent effect on actin ﬁlament load than LatA . We propose that the decreases in HA density within clusters seen with LatA and CytoD treatments could result from either the lateral dispersion of previously clustered HA molecules or the dispersal and reformation of less dense de novo clusters after drug treat - ments . We believe the former possibility applies to our models ( Fig . S6 ) , although the principles of underlying actin organization are the same for both scenarios . Because actin disruptors also cause changes in cell morphology , these changes may also contribute to the observed changes in cluster morphology . If the actin ﬁlaments themselves serve as obstacles to cage each cluster , then depolymerizing these ﬁlaments should result in the dispersal of molecules in these clusters . Indeed , this is consistent with the results we observed after treatment with LatA or CytoD . In the context of such a conﬁnement model , one would also expect that Jas treat - ment , by stabilizing the actin ﬁlament barriers , would keep the HA cluster sizes constant . However , Jas treatment resulted in increased HA cluster areas , indicating a mecha - nism whereby actin density is positively correlated with HA clustering , and increases in cortical actin ﬁlament density stabilize existing membrane domains and their peripheries ( Fig . 4 E ) . Similarly , instead of ﬁnding that clusters had an anticorrelation or no association with actin , as might be expected if individual actin ﬁlaments were conﬁning whole clusters , we observed the colocalization of actin and HA at length scales spanning from tens of nanometers up to several micrometers . The alteration in HA cluster density and size with these actin - disrupting agents instead indicates that individual actin ﬁlaments ( at an increased density adjacent to the HA cluster ) may provide points of anchor for clustered membrane proteins . We observed a striking lateral heterogeneity in the density of actin , and differences in the movement characteristics of HA molecules in regions of high or low actin density . Other imaging studies have illustrated the three - dimensionality of the actin cytoskeleton ( 67 , 68 ) , and we propose that areas of A B C 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 Corrected Average Uncorrected Average P a i r C o r r e l a t i on g ( r ) D Distance r ( μ m ) Dendra2 - HA PAmCherry - Cofilin Merge FIGURE 5 Coﬁlin is differentially excluded from HA clusters . Clusters of Dendra2 - HA and PAmCherry - coﬁlin were imaged by two - color FPALM in ﬁxed NIH3T3 - HAb2 cells . ( A , green channel ) Clusters of HA span a range of length scales . ( B , red channel ) Coﬁlin was dispersed diffusely throughout the cell , except for areas surrounding HA clusters . ( C ) Merge . Extending hundreds of nanometers to micrometers from the periphery of HA clusters was typically a zone excluding coﬁlin ( white arrows ) , although this pattern was not absolute . Some small HA clusters colocalized with coﬁlin clusters ( white arrowheads ) . These images were taken at the bottom membrane with an effective focal depth of 5 0 . 5 m m . Scale bar ¼ 2 m m . ( D ) The pair - cross - correlation function for HA and coﬁlin depends strongly on bleed - through correction . The uncorrected curve ( red line ) overestimates correlation and underestimates anticorrelation . The corrected ( black points 5 SE , n ¼ 14 ﬁxed cells ) shows signiﬁcant anticorrelation , especially on length scales of ~ 600 nm . Biophysical Journal 104 ( 10 ) 2182 – 2192 2188 Gudheti et al . dense cortical actin meshwork provide one structural basis for cluster cohesion . The highly protein - speciﬁc segregation of membrane proteins ( 8 ) is not easily explained by models that invoke arrangements of TM proteins to reduce the lateral diffusion of membrane components ( see Chichili and Rodgers ( 13 ) for review ) . Furthermore , we observed that actin and HA colocalize on the nanoscale , which sug - gests that actin and membrane proteins work in concert on molecular length scales to stabilize membrane domains . On timescales of tens of milliseconds , the motion of HA molecules was slower in proximity to actin ( Fig . 2 F ) . The peak at ~ 0 (cid:2) in the histogram of HA turn angles ( Fig . 2 E ) corresponds to HA molecules that took two successive steps in the same direction . The peak at ~ 180 (cid:2) corresponds to HA molecules that took one step in a given direction , followed by a step in the opposite direction . The strong biases ( peaks ) in the histogram as a function of angle suggest conﬁnement of HA . The dependence of the frequency of these steps on actin density suggests a role for actin in the conﬁnement . These ﬁndings suggest that ARMRs or other actin - associ - ated cell components constrain the motion of HA . The colocalization of HA with actin and the elongated HA cluster shape further support this interpretation . HA clusters are associated with heterogeneous coﬁlin distribution : cluster - actin feedback Coﬁlin is an ABP that can act to increase the dissociation ( off ) rates of actin monomers from ﬁlaments ( 48 ) , nucleate actin ﬁlaments ( 44 ) , or sever actin ﬁlaments ( 69 ) depending on the coﬁlin / actin molar ratios . Coﬁlin is implicated in a range of diverse cellular processes , including regulation of actin dynamics during cell motility and leading - edge protrusion ( 43 ) . Our ﬁnding that the actin remodeling protein coﬁlin is laterally excluded from regions within several hundred nanometers of HA clusters suggests that HA can directly or indirectly mediate the spatial distribution of ABPs . HA mediation of the distribution of coﬁlin is expected to have an effect on actin organization that provides a ( possible ) mechanism for two - way coupling between clustering of membrane proteins and the local actin environment ( Fig . 6 ) . Although there is considerable evidence for interactions between other inﬂuenza viral components and actin , we found no published evidence for HA interacting directly with actin . However , surface accumulation of HA can acti - vate the PKC a and Raf / MEK / ERK signaling pathways ( 25 ) , which both depend on and mediate actin structure ( 70 , 71 ) . Thus , although we have not demonstrated the role of signaling in the observed HA and coﬁlin distributions , path - ways have been identiﬁed through which HA could mediate actin and ABP organization . Lateral mobility of HA : dynamic properties depend on local actin density The dynamic nature of the actin cytoskeleton cannot be easily portrayed in a static ﬁgure . The observed effects of a 10 min LatA treatment on HA cluster morphology indi - cate that the actin ﬁlaments underlying these HA domains are likely turning over within this time . This highlights an important point : if membrane - associated actin ﬁla - ments were dynamically treadmilling , one would expect attachments between HA and actin to be transitory , as has been proposed for potassium channels in living cell mem - branes ( 17 ) . We observed two mobile populations of HA : one fraction ( 74 % 5 7 % ) with a diffusion coefﬁcient ( D 1 ¼ 0 . 109 5 0 . 066 m m 2 / s ) that is consistent with the mobile fraction and diffusion coefﬁcient measured by FRAP at 37 (cid:2) C ( 18 , 72 ) . Note that the interpretation of the fraction of the two HA populations could be complicated by exchange Hemagglutinin trimer Actin monomer Actin filament Actin binding protein Cluster associated protein Cofilin Cluster associated lipid Cluster Cluster A B Inhibition FIGURE 6 Cluster feedback . Models of actin - mediated organization of membrane proteins , and membrane protein - mediated organization of un - derlying actin . ( A ) HA signals to inactivate coﬁlin immediately adjacent to the plasma membrane , resulting in a higher local density of longer , more stable actin ﬁlaments . These ﬁlaments create a meshwork and increase the numbers of potential anchor points for HA molecules . Intermediate ABPs that may link actin ﬁlaments and HA pro - teins are unknown . Inverted black T indicates inhi - bition of coﬁlin . ( B ) HA clusters with other membrane - bound proteins and lipids , which them - selves signal to inactivate coﬁlin locally . As in model A , this inactivation results in an increased local density of actin ﬁlaments and hence an increase in the number of anchor points for pro - teins in the cluster . Inverted black T indicates inhi - bition of coﬁlin . Biophysical Journal 104 ( 10 ) 2182 – 2192 Actin and Membrane Organization of HA 2189 between the two populations , and by the limited timescale over which HA trajectories can be obtained . Interestingly , the slow - moving HA fraction we observed could appear to be the immobile fraction in FRAP experiments . The ﬁnding that the slow - moving HA population is not completely immobile demonstrates that even within membrane regions that are highly concentrated with HA , and despite the strong correlation between HA and actin distributions , some lateral mobility is retained . Although it is consistent with predic - tions of anomalous lateral diffusion , the observation of HA mobility precludes the possibility that the HA molecules themselves serve as either immobile pickets in the mem - brane - associated fence , or that HA itself is bound directly to such immobile pickets . Previous research has indicated the involvement of the G - protein - activated Src - family kinase Lyn in inducing periods of reduced mobility in clusters of GPI - anchored receptors ( 73 ) . The cross - linking of GPI - anchored receptors also induces the formation of clusters on the order of hundreds of nanometers in size that colocalize with actin ( 41 ) . It is unclear in our case whether HA acts to reorganize actin by directly initiating signaling cascades ( Fig . 6 A ) or indirectly through other regulators of actin organization ( Fig . 6 B ) . Because cortical actin can mediate phase separa - tion of membrane lipids ( 74 , 75 ) , local enrichments in cortical actin may allow for a framework to which some membrane proteins can bind , while also stabilizing patches of certain lipids and proteins around these aggregations . Cell - surface accumulation and clustering of HA are known to activate PKC a and Raf / MEK / ERK pathways ( 25 ) , both of which can regulate coﬁlin ( 63 , 76 ) . Phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) ( 4 , 5 ) is associated with each of these pathways ( 77 , 78 ) and is a regulator of coﬁlin activity ( 79 ) . PIP 2 has also been implicated in mediating signaling from membrane domains to the cytoskeleton ( 80 ) . Further work in which coﬁlin is imaged together with its regulators will help to elucidate the upstream pathways that ultimately con - trol local cytoskeletal organization and its interactions with membrane components .
