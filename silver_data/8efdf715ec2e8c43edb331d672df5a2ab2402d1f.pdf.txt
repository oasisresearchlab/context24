Breeding pairs for the experiment de - scribed here were derived from the first high and low strains ( H1 and L , respectively ) . DNA was extracted from spleens , diluted to a concentration of 10 ng / pl , and 50 ng used for each polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) .

Dvorak , Jun Liu , Phil Oh In situ coating of the surface of endothelial cells in rat lung with cationic colloidal silica particles was used to separate caveolae from detergent - insoluble membranes rich in glycosyl phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins but devoid of caveolin . Immuno - gold electron microscopy showed that ganglioside GMl - enriched caveolae associated with an annular plasmalemmal domain enriched in GPI - anchored proteins . The purified caveolae contained molecular components required for regulated transport , including various lipid - anchored signaling molecules . Such specialized distinct microdomains may exist separately or together in the plasma membrane to organize signaling molecules and to process surface - bound ligands differentially . Cholesterol and glycolipids self - associate in lipid bilayers to form organized composition - al microdomains ( 1 ) . GPI - anchored and other lipid - linked proteins may preferential - ly partition into glycolipid microdomains that are resistant to nonionic detergent sol - ubilization ( 2 - 5 ) . GPI - anchored proteins appear to be sorted into glycolipid , deter - gent - resistant " rafts " in the trans - Golgi net - work for polarized delivery to the cell surface by caveolin - rich smooth exocytotic carrier vesicles ( 3 , 5 - 8 ) . On the cell surface , they are thought to reside in smooth membrane invaginations known as caveolae ( 9 , 10 ) , which are apparently also rich in glycolipids , cholesterol , and caveolin ( 7 , 11 - 14 ) . Anti - body cross - linking of cell surface glycolipids ( 1 ) and GPI - linked proteins ( 15 ) can in - crease sequestration into clusters and induce cell activation ( 1 , 16 ) , apparently through lipid - anchored nonreceptor tyrosine kinases ( NRTKs ) ( 17 ) . Caveolae have been impli - cated not only in signaling but also in trans - port via endocytosis , transcytosis , and poto - cytosis ( 14 , 18 - 21 ) . The physiological func - tions of and interrelations between caveo - lae , detergent - resistant microdomains , and various lipid - anchored molecules remain undefined . To explore the relation between GPI - anchored proteins and caveolae under con - ditions that avoid potential influences of antibody effectors , cell culture ( 22 ) , and contamination from intracellular compart - ments , we purified the plasma membranes of rat lung endothelial cells and then sub - fractionated them into specific microdo - mains . The rat lung vasculature was per - fused in situ at 100 to 13°C with a suspen - sion of cationic colloidal silica particles , which coated the luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes normally exposed to the circulating blood . This coating created a stable pellicle that specifically marked this membrane and enhanced its density , which allowed its purification from tissue homo - genates by centrifugation ( 13 , 23 ) . The sil - ica - coated membrane pellets ( P ) were en - riched in endothelial cell surface markers , with little contamination from other tissue components ( 13 , 23 ) . Caveolae attached on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membranes , opposite to the silica coating , were stripped from these membranes by shearing during homogeniza - tion at 4°C in the presence of Triton X - 100 . They were then isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation to yield a homoge - neous population of biochemically and morphologically distinct caveolar vesicles ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . As with caveolae present on the endothelial cell surface in vivo ( 7 , 12 , 24 ) , these purified caveolae ( V ) were en - riched in caveolin , plasmalemmal Ca2 + - dependent adenosine triphosphatase , and the inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate receptor ( 13 ) . In contrast , other markers present am - ply in P , including angiotensin - converting enzyme , band 4 . 1 , and 13 - actin , were almost totally excluded from V . The purified caveolae were not rich in GPI - anchored proteins . First , detergent ex - traction studies performed on P revealed differences in the ability of various deter - gents to solubilize caveolin and 5 ' - nucleoti - dase ( 5 ' - NT ) . Caveolin was partially solubi - lized by P3 - octyl glucoside , CHAPS , deoxy - cholate , NP - 40 , and SDS ( but not Triton X - 100 ) , whereas 5 ' - NT was rendered soluble only by SDS and deoxycholate ( Fig . 1A ) . Second , like caveolin , 5 ' - NT and urokinase - plasminogen activator receptor ( uPAR ) were enriched in P relative to the starting rat lung homogenate ( H ) ( Fig . IC ) . How - ever , unlike caveolin , these proteins were not enriched in V ; they remained almost totally associated with the resedimented sil - ica - coated membranes stripped of the caveo - lae ( P - V ) [ which contain few , if any , re - maining caveolae ( 13 ) ] . More than 95 % of the signal for caveolin was detected in V , with < 4 % remaining in P - V . Conversely , > 95 % of 5 ' - NT and uPAR remained in P - V , with < 3 % present in V . Thus , these GPI - anchored proteins were neither cou - SCIENCE * VOL . 269 * 8 SEPTEMBER 1995 Department of Pathology , Harvard Medical School , Beth Israel Hospital , 99 Brookline Avenue , Boston , MA 02215 , USA . * To whom correspondence should be addressed . 1 . 2a ; ' 1 . 1 WO - - - m EUM , m IRMWOR 19 gnewm 1 435 on N o v e m be r 16 , 2009 www . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m pled to caveolin nor concentrated in the isolated caveolin - enriched caveolae . Other methodologies not based on the silica - coating technique have been devel - oped for isolating low density , detergent - resistant membranes from a variety of cul - tured cells and tissues ( 3 - 5 , 25 , 26 ) . By performing similar isolations with rat lung tissue as in ( 26 ) , we showed , consistent with previous studies ( 5 , 25 , 26 ) , that caveolin and GPI - anchored proteins ( in this instance , 5 ' - NT ) were both present in the isolated Triton X - 100 - insoluble mem - branes ( TI ) ( Fig . 1B ) . In addition , differen - tial detergent extraction studies were per - formed on TI . As expected ( 3 - 5 ) , GPI - anchored proteins were solubilized effec - tively by P - octyl glucoside , CHAPS , deoxycholate , and SDS ( 27 ) , different from the pattern of solubility for 5 ' - NT in P but similar to that for caveolin in P . There has been a tendency to equate low density , Triton - insoluble membranes with caveolae ( 5 , 25 , 26 ) . Electron microscopy of the V and TI membrane preparations re - vealed that V comprised a relatively homo - geneous population of vesicles ( . 100 nm ) with the typical morphology of caveolae , whereas TI contained caveolae , linear mem - brane sheets , and many larger vesicles ( . 150 nm ) ( Fig . 2 ) . In many favorable cross sec - tions , a characteristic flask - shaped caveola attached to a larger , spherical vesicle was apparent , suggesting that these two deter - gent - resistant membrane domains were asso - ciated with each other as a unit before frac - tionation in the membrane ( Fig . 2 , D and E ) . Because the larger noncaveolar vesicles in TI contained the GPI - linked proteins ( Fig . 3 ) , it appeared that silica coating of the outer membrane surface altered the way in which the GPI - anchored proteins interacted with various detergents and thus prevented the separation of non - caveolar , detergent - resistant microdo - mains from the cell membranes . Cationic silica particles interact with the anionic cell surface to stabilize it against vesicula - tion or lateral rearrangement by immobi - lizing membrane molecules ( 28 ) . Because the silica particles uniformly coated the cell surface but were rarely associated with or present inside the caveolae because of their size , it is likely ( 13 , 23 ) that the plasma membrane was stabilized by being firmly attached on one side to most , if not all , nonvesiculated regions . This adherent pellicle would allow the caveolae on the opposite side of the membrane to be sheared away by homogenization , with lit - tle contamination from other membranes , including other detergent - resistant do - mains . Conversely , without silica coating , both caveolar and noncaveolar detergent - resistant membranes would be coisolated . In addition , without isolating the plasma 1436 membrane first , such preparations of cells and tissues would also contain intracellu - lar detergent - insoluble caveolin - rich do - mains , such as those present in the trans - Golgi network ( 3 , 7 ) . As a test , we increased the salt concen - tration during the isolation procedure , which reduced electrostatic interactions sufficiently to detach the plasma membrane from the silica pellicle in P and to allow the coisolation of caveolae with GPI - linked protein microdomains ( 29 ) . More impor - tantly , because the silica coating did indeed prevent the release of the detergent - insolu - ble membranes rich in GPI - anchored pro - teins , it was possible to isolate these do - A 3 - OG CHAPS S I Caveolin | A S I Deoxy S A C H P V P - V WP - V Caveolin 1 | 49 .

The caveolin in P - V is equivalent to that seen in ( C ) , representing the small residual signal after stripping of the caveolae ( compare V and P - V ) , except that the exposure here is much longer . GM1 could not be detected in P - V [ see ( C ) ] nor , as expected , in G or RP ( 27 ) . G is rich in GPI - linked proteins ( 5 ' - NT , uPAR , and CA ) but lacks caveolin and GMi .

Overall , a * - size criterion was obvious in distinguishing the caveolar vesicles from the larger noncaveolar vesicles . Therefore , we divided the i vesicles clearly observed in the electron micrographs into two - I . - groups : those with diameters of < 80 nm and those with diameters of > 150 nm . This size criterion cannot be considered absolute in separating caveolae from noncaveolar vesicles , because , for in - stance , a few caveolae could remain attached to each other and form a larger vesicle . Nevertheless , 86 % of the vesicles of < 80 nm , were labeled for GM1 , with a range of one to nine gold particles per caveola , whereas only 2 % were labeled for CA ( all labeled with only one gold particle ) . For the larger vesicles , 80 % were labeled for CA and only 13 % for GM , ( 2 - 50 vesicles were counted in each category ) . These results support the use of GM1 as a caveolar marker , substantiate the size criterion , and are consistent with previous studies on GM1 localization ( 11 , 14 ) . Bars , 100 nm .

Thus , it appears that a substantial but variable fraction of GPI - anchored pro - teins exists on the cell surface dynamically partitioned into detergent - resistant glyco - lipid microdomains that are not likely to be simply a consequence of detergent extrac - tion , and that the size of this fraction may depend on cell type , culture , and ligand or antibody exposure . Normally , and even more so after cross - linking , GPI - anchored proteins can parti - tion into diffusion - restrictive microdo - mains , some of which may associate with caveolae as an annular region at the open - ing . Our experiments with detergent - resis - tant membranes support this model in sev - eral ways . Because both domains are resis - tant to detergent solubilization , the normal - ly flat membrane region surrounding the opening of the caveola is essentially excised from the plasmalemma to form an intact large vesicle with a caveola still attached and located usually inside but sometimes outside of the vesicle . These structures were often detected by electron microscopy ( Fig . 2 , C to E ) . The silica coating prevents the coisolation of this microdomain with the caveolae . Consequently , much smaller amounts of GPI - linked proteins were de - tected in the pure caveola preparations ( V ) than in preparations containing the larger vesicles ( Fig . 1 ) . Indeed , it was the larger vesicles that were rich in GPI - linked pro - teins , as indicated by both immunoblot analysis ( Fig . 1 ) and immuno - electron mi - croscopy . Immunogold labeling of TI local - ized CA to the larger vesicles and linear membranes but not the caveolae ( Fig . 3 , A to C ) . Consistent with a model of distinct but associated domains , CA was also present on small remnants of plasma mem - brane outside of the caveolae but still at - tached to the neck ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . In contrast , immunogold labeling for GM1 was frequently detected inside the caveolae ( Fig . 3 , F to H ) , consistent with our bio - chemical data and with gold localization of GMi performed on cells ( 11 , 14 ) . In addi - tion , the caveolae were labeled with gold - conjugated cholera toxin ( Fig . 31 ) . All the membrane subfractions de - scribed so far were isolated after exposure to detergent in order to be consistent and limit the number of variables in the comparison of V versus TI versus G . However , the exposure to detergent is of concern . Even though the TI and G preparations require detergent for microdomain excision from the whole membranes , caveolae can be sheared and isolated from P without deter - gent , although less efficiently ( 13 , 34 ) . Caveolin and GM were enriched in , where - as GPI - anchored proteins were almost com - pletely excluded from , detergent - free puri - 1438 fied caveolae ( V ' ) ( Fig . 1E ) . Lipid anchors such as GPI may control the ability of proteins to partition selective - ly , but reversibly , within specialized mi - crodomains and , therefore , may subserve a targeting function . The GPI anchor directly affects association with detergent - resistant membranes ( 35 ) , membrane diffusion ( 8 , 32 ) , polarized delivery to cell surfaces ( 6 ) , cell activation ( 36 ) , and the rate and path - way of internalization ( 10 ) . Other lipid - anchored proteins , including NRTKs and guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) - binding proteins such as Rab5 , are found in deter - gent - resistant complexes ( 5 , 25 , 26 , 35 , 37 ) . Our analysis reveals that various NRTKs ( Yes and Lyn ) ( 27 ) , heterotrimeric GTP - binding proteins ( a and Py subunits ) ( 38 ) , and as yet unidentified small GTP - binding proteins ( but not Rab5 ) ( 38 ) are indeed present in purified caveolae . The physical association of GPI - an - chored protein microdomains with caveolae suggests functional interplay between them . These structures may provide a platform for ligand processing by integrating signal trans - duction with membrane transport . Binding of natural ligands or antibodies to GPI - linked proteins can induce clustering ( 2 , 15 ) , internalization by caveolae via potocy - tosis ( 21 , 39 ) or endocytosis ( 10 , 40 , 41 ) , and even cell activation ( 16 ) . Signaling may regulate caveolar processing ( 41 , 42 ) , and various mediators of signaling reside in caveolae ( 13 , 24 , 38 ) . Lastly , surface - bound molecules are endocytosed or transcytosed by caveolae in endothelium ( 14 , 18 - 20 , 43 ) . Disassembly of caveolae prevents such trans - port ( 19 ) , and molecular mapping of caveo - lae reveals the presence of SNARE fusion proteins and guanosine triphosphatases nec - essary for regulated N - ethylmaleimide - sensi - tive vesicular transport ( 38 , 44 ) . Caveolae thus appear to contain the molecular ma - chinery for integrating signaling with carrier transport . Dynamic ligand processing via clustering , signaling , and vesicular transport may occur through the association of the GPI - linked protein microdomains with caveolae or even possibly via caveolar for - mation . Such specialized distinct microdo - mains may exist separately or associated with each other not only to organize signaling molecules but also to process surface - bound ligands differentially .

When cells are isolated from tissues and grown in culture , there can be a substantial loss of caveolae from the cell surface , especially forendothelial cells [ J . E . Schnitzer , A . Siflinger - Bimboim , P . J . Del Vecchio , A . B . Malik , Biochem . Biophys . Res . Commun . 199 , 11 ( 1994 ) ] . Such losses ( often > 100 - fold ) represent a substantial alteration in plasma membrane organiza - tion and may reflect a major perturbation in caveolar function and even GPI - linked protein clustering . 23 .

Isolation of caveolae was performed under high - salt conditions to minimize the electrostatic interaction between the cationic silica particles and the polyan - ionic cell surface . Under these conditions , intact membranes were separated from the silica pellicle , and , with the addition of Triton X - 100 , low density , detergent - resistant membranes were isolated as usual by sucrose density gradient centrifugation ( 13 ) . GPI - linked proteins not normally associated with pure caveolae , such as 5 ' - NT , were now present in this isolate ( 27 ) . Furthermore , electron microscopy revealed that the specimens , which appeared bio - chemically impure by this criterion , contained caveo - lae mixed with larger vesicular structures , including single caveolae attached to the inside of the larger vesicles , similar to those present in TI ( Fig . 2 ) . ~ - .

Antibody - cross - linked al - kaline phosphatase clusters and slowly enters caveolae for endocytosis to endosomes and lyso - somes ( 41 ) , consistent with our studies of internal - ization of modified albumins by caveolae , with the exception that the process of binding , clustering , internalization , and degradation was much quicker for the albumins ( 19 , 43 ) . It appears that cell surface processing , at least for GPI - linked proteins , probably comprises three distinct sequential steps : ( i ) induced movement of GPI - anchored proteins ( probably by a ligand ) into microdomains near the caveolae , thereby increasing the local concentration of GPI - linked pro - teins by direct sequestration of previously free mol - ecules or possibly by assembly of several smaller clusters ; ( ii ) eventual movement into the caveolae ; and ( iii ) fission or budding of the caveolae from the membrane for potocytosis or endocytosis . 32 .

Specialized glycolipid domains are resistant to deter - gent extraction and are necessary for maintaining detergent - resistant clusters of GPI - linked proteins ( 2 - 5 ) . Removal of cholesterol from plasma mem - branes can dissociate or prevent the formation of such clusters and assure a random , free distribution of GPI - anchored proteins ( 39 ) . As expected , choles - terol removal reduces the resistance of GPI - linked proteins to detergent solubilization ( 5 ) , consistent with the notion that the freely diffusing GPI - anchored proteins are indeed more readily solubilized by de - tergents than the less mobile GPI - anchored proteins in the glycolipid domains . Moreover , in the absence of glycolipids , GPI - anchored proteins are readily sol - ubilized from membranes by cold Triton X - 100 ; sol - ubility decreases with the addition of appropriate gly - colipids ( 2 ) . Thus , GPI - anchored proteins randomly distributed at the cell surface should be susceptible to detergent extraction ; indeed , our percentages agree with those from the diffusion studies dis - cussed in the text . In homogenates of non - silica - coated rat lung , - 60 % of CA and 75 % of 5 ' - NT are solubilized by Triton X - 1 00 at 40C . Moreover , mass balances performed on the silica - coated mem - branes showed that - 20 % of 5 ' - NT and 40 % of CA could be isolated in the intact , detergent - resistant membrane fraction TI . 34 . As noted in ( 13 ) , caveolae can be isolated without exposure to Triton X - 100 , but less efficiently . The usual protocol was followed for caveolae isolation , with the exception that Triton X - 1 00 was omitted and , for shearing purposes , the number of homoge - nization strokes was increased to 48 to 60 from 12 . 35 .

The membrane preparations were processed for immuno - electron microscopy by a modification of a previously described procedure [ P . De Camilli , S . M . Harris Jr . , W . B . Huttner , P J Greengard , J . Cell Biol . 96 , 1355 ( 1983 ) ] . The detergent - resistant membranes from rat lung ( TI ) isolated as described ( 26 ) directly in suspension from the sucrose gradi - ent were mixed with 4 % agarose ( Seaplaque ; FMC Bioproducts ) in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) at 370C at a vesicle : agarose volume ratio of 1 : 3 . The suspension was transferred by capillary action into a frame prepared from two glass slides separated at each end by two cover slips ( 0 . 17 mm thick ) . After cooling immediately to solidify the agarose , the frame was removed and the agarose cut into 2 - mm squares , which were then incubated in 5 % ovalbumin in PBS for 30 min , washed briefly in PBS , and incubated with anti - CA , anti - GM1 , or nonimmune serum overnight at 40C . After five 10 - min washes in PBS , the blocks were incubated for 8 hours at 40C with colloidal gold particles ( 10 to 15 nm in diameter ) conjugated with goat antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulin G . After five 30 - min washes in PBS , the agarose - embedded membranes were fixed for 30 min with 1 % glutaraldehyde in PBS , washed in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) ( two times , 5 min each ) , incubated for 1 hour with 1 % OS04 , dehydrated , and embedded in Epon . Ultrathin sections were cut , stained with 1 % lead citrate , and viewed under a Philips P - 300 electron microscope . 46 . The silica - coated membrane pellet already stripped of caveolae ( P - V ) was resuspended in 20 mM 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid with 125 mM NaCI and an equal volume of 4 M K2HPO4 and 0 . 2 % polyacrylate ( pH 9 . 5 ) . The solution was sonicated ( 10 10 - s bursts ) with cooling , mixed on a rotator for 8 hours at room temperature ( 200 to 25°C ) , and soni - cated again ( five 1 0 - s bursts ) . Triton X - 1 00 was add - ed to 1 % , and the preparation was then mixed for 10 min at 4CC and homogenized with a Type AA Teflon tissue grinder ( Thomas Scientific , Swedesboro , NJ ) . Any intact floating detergent - resistant membranes were separated and isolated from this homogenate by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as in ( 13 ) . The pellet , containing silica and any remaining mem - branes , was also collected . 47 . Cholera toxin B fragment ( CT ) at 60 pg / ml was con - jugated to 15 - nm colloidal gold in 2 mM sodium borate buffer ( pH 6 . 9 ) for 30 min with stirring . Poly - ethylene glycol ( 20 kD ) was added for the last 5 min to a final concentration of 0 . 5 mg / mI . Unconjugated CT was removed by three cycles of centrifugation ( 1 0 , 000g for 20 min ) and resuspension in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) . The resuspended conjugate ( CT - Au ) was dialyzed overnight against a solution containing 50 mM tris ( pH 6 . 9 ) and 150 mM NaCI . Sodium azide was added to 0 . 02 % and the conjugate was stored at 40C . The isolated mem - branes were labeled as described ( 45 ) , with the ex - ception that CT - Au replaced the primary antibody and was followed directly by washing without addi - tional incubations . 48 .

Conaway * The Elongin ( Sill ) complex activates elongation by mammalian RNA polymerase 11 by suppressing transient pausing of the polymerase at many sites within transcription units . Elongin is a heterotrimer composed of A , B , and C subunits of 1 10 , 18 , and 15 kilodaltons , respectively . Here , the mammalian Elongin A gene was isolated and expressed , and the Elongin ( Sill ) complex reconstituted with recombinant subunits . Elongin A is shown to function as the transcriptionally active component of Elongin ( Sill ) and Elongin B and C as regulatory subunits . Whereas Elongin C assembles with Elongin A to form an AC complex with increased specific activity , Elongin B , a member of the ubiquitin - homology gene family , appears to serve a chaperone - like function , facilitating assembly and en - hancing stability of the Elongin ( Sill ) complex . Eukaryotic messenger RNA synthesis is a complex biochemical process controlled in part by the concerted action of a set of general transcription factors that regulate the activity of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) at both the initiation and elongation stages of transcription . At least six general initia - tion factors ( TFIIA , TFIIB , TFIID , TFIIE , TEJIF , and TFIIH ) have been identified in eukaryotic cells and found to promote se - lective binding of RNA polymerase II to T .
