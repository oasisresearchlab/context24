REVIEW Macropinocytosis : an endocytic pathway for internalising large gulps Jet Phey Lim and Paul A Gleeson Macropinocytosis is a regulated form of endocytosis that mediates the non - selective uptake of solute molecules , nutrients and antigens . It is an actin - dependent process initiated from surface membrane rufﬂes that give rise to large endocytic vacuoles called macropinosomes . Macropinocytosis is important in a range of physiological processes ; it is highly active in macrophages and dendritic cells where it is a major pathway for the capture of antigens , it is relevant to cell migration and tumour metastasis and it represents a portal of cell entry exploited by a range of pathogens . The molecular basis for the formation and maturation of macropinosomes has only recently begun to be deﬁned . Here , we review the general characteristics of macropinocytosis , describe some of the regulators of this pathway , which have been identiﬁed to date and highlight strategies to explore the relevance of this endocytosis pathway in vivo . Immunology and Cell Biology ( 2011 ) 89 , 836 – 843 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / icb . 2011 . 20 ; published online 22 March 2011 Keywords : macropinocytosis ; endocytosis ; antigen - presenting cells ; pathogen invasion ; signalling ENDOCYTOSIS Endocytosis is the uptake of membrane proteins , lipids , extracellular ligands and soluble molecules , such as nutrients , from the cell surface into the cell interior by endocytic vesicles . The cargo and membrane components of the vesicles can subsequently either be sent back to the plasma membrane , thus recycling its content back to the cell surface , or the components can be transported to the late endosomes / lysosomes for degradation . In general , endocytosis can be divided into two types of pathways : the clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytic pathways . The clathrin - dependent endocytic pathway requires the recruitment of endocytosed molecules into clathrin - coated pits that are B 100nm in diameter . Formation of clathrin - coated pits is initiated by adaptor proteins , such as adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) , which binds cargo - bearing receptors and also promotes clathrin assembly into a lattice - like network . 1 , 2 Clathrin assembly may be the driving force that converts the ﬂat plasma membrane into the highly curved clathrin - coated pit . Through protein – protein interactions , clathrin and adaptor proteins also recruit other endocytic regulatory proteins , such as dynamin and synaptojanin . The GTPase dynamin is considered responsible for the ﬁssion of clathrin - coated vesicles from the plasma membrane whereas synaptojanin regulates vesicle uncoating . 1 , 2 Up till the early 1990s , there was controversy over the existence of pathways that may be independent of clathrin . Early studies on the uptake of bacterial toxins using pharmacological perturbations that were considered to interfere with clathrin - dependent uptake did not block all endocytosis . 3 This ﬁnding hinted that other endocytic pathways may exist . A more deﬁnitive strategy came from the application of genetic tools . In 1995 , it was demonstrated that expression of a dominant - negative form of dynamin , known to be required for budding of clathrin - coated pits , did not block ﬂuid - phase internalisation of horseradish peroxidase . 4 The use of dominant - negative mutants of other clathrin - coated pit proteins such as epidermal growth factor receptor substrate 15 ( EPS15 ) and AP180 5 , 6 also conﬁrmed that endocytosis can occur independently of the clathrin - dependent uptake pathway . By the late 1990s , the concept of clathrin - independent endocytosis was ﬁrmly established . MACROPINOCYTOSIS One of the clathrin - independent endocytic routes is macropinocytosis , a process that was ﬁrst described morphologically by Warren Lewis in 1931 . 7 By speeding up the normally slow movement of rat macro - phages captured using time - lapse microcinematography , Lewis was able to reveal that ‘waving’ cell surface rufﬂes close back on the plasma membrane to form phase bright vesicles . 7 Lewis named this activity pinocytosis and was later renamed macropinocytosis to differentiate the pathway from processes involving smaller vesicles . Macropinocytosis is a signal - dependent process that normally occurs in response to growth factor stimulation , such as macro - phage colony - stimulating factor - 1 ( CSF - 1 ) , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and platelet - derived growth factor or tumour - promoting factor , such as phorbol myristate acetate . 8 – 11 However , some specia - lised cell types such as antigen - presenting cells are capable of constitutive macropinocytosis . 12 – 14 Macropinocytosis involves actin - Received 30 December 2010 ; revised 10 February 2011 ; accepted 11 February 2011 ; published online 22 March 2011 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute , The University of Melbourne , Melbourne , Victoria , Australia Correspondence : Professor PA Gleeson , Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute , The University of Melbourne , Melbourne , Victoria 3010 , Australia .

However , a subset of lamellipodia may fold back onto themselves and fuse with the basal membrane creating large , irregular shaped vesicles termed macropi - nosomes ( Figure 1 ) . There is , however , no consensus as to the propor - tion of membrane rufﬂes that end up forming macropinosomes . Macropinosomes are distinct from other forms of endocytic vesi - cles . Macropinocytic vesicles have no apparent coat structures and although heterogenous in size , they are generally considered to be 4 0 . 2 m m in diameter , 15 , 16 a size considerably larger than the clathrin - coated vesicles . Owing to the large size of macropinosomes , which can be up to 5 m m in diameter , macropinocytosis provides cells with a way to non - selectively internalise large quantities of solute and membrane . Thus , in addition to its size , macropinosomes can also easily be identiﬁed through the use of ﬂuid phase markers , such as Lucifer Yellow , horseradish peroxidase and dextran . Once formed , macropinosomes undergo a maturation process . However , this maturation is unlikely to occur by a common pathway in all cells ( Figure 1 ) . Bone marrow - derived macrophages form macropinosomes in response to treatment with CSF - 1 . 9 The macro - pinosomes then shrink , acquire and lose different endocytic protein markers as they migrate centripetally toward the lysosome . Within 1min of colony - stimulating factor - 1 treatment , macropinosomes of bone marrow - derived macrophages stained - positive for transferrin receptors . These are considered to be macropinosomes at an early maturation stage . 17 Within 2 – 4min , the macropinosomes were devoid of transferrin receptors and began to acquire Rab7 , a marker of the late endosomes . Rab7 - staining coincided with the presence of lysosomal glycoprotein A ( lgp - A ) . However , Rab7 - staining was subsequently lost while lysosomal glycoprotein A - staining remained at a high level . Finally , the macropinosomes merge with the existing tubular lysoso - mal compartments . 17 Similar to macropinosome maturation in macrophages , macropinosomes in EGF - stimulated HEK293 cells also mature as they migrate to the centre of the cell . Maturation of macropinosomes formed in EGF - stimulated HEK293 cells has been shown to involve highly dynamic extension of sorting nexin 5 ( SNX5 ) - positive tubules away from the macropinosome body . 18 The loss of SNX5 - positive tubules from the macropinosome was associated with a reduction in the surface area of the macropinosome as it matures and acquires the marker of the late endosomes , Rab7 , eventually fusing with the lysosomes . 18 Unlike bone marrow - derived macrophages or HEK293 cells , macro - pinosomes in EGF - treated A431 cells have a different fate and do not fuse with the lysosomes . 15 , 19 After approximately 5min of EGF stimulation , macropinosomes in A431 cells have been reported to be positive for the transferrin receptors 19 and faintly positive for early endosomal antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) . 20 Macropinosomes in A431 cells do not seem to mature beyond the early endosomal stage as indicated by the presence of early endosomal antigen 1 . Instead , early endosomal antigen 1 mediates homotypic fusion between macropinosomes . 15 , 20 , 21 Ultimately , the macropinosome fuses with the plasma membrane , recycling its content to the exterior of the cell . 15 , 19 The basis for the different fates of macropinosomes in different cell types is not known . PHYSIOLOGICAL RELEVANCE OF MACROPINOCYTOSIS Motility As macropinocytosis is associated with actin - dependent rufﬂing of the plasma membrane this pathway has been implicated in cell motility . Given this relationship with cell motility , macropinocytosis is very relevant to tumour progression and metastasis . Macropinocytosis is also considered important in the chemotactic response of highly mobile cells , such as the neutrophils . 22 Neutrophils have the ability to sense , move towards , ingest and kill microorganisms . These func - tions of neutrophils are mediated by several classes of cell surface receptors . Among these are the chemoattractant receptors , such as those that bind to formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine , and complement receptors ( CR ) , such as the CR1 that binds C3b . 23 , 24 Carpentier et al . 22 tracked the movement of CR1 in human neutro - phils using anti - CR1 antibodies and electron microscopy and was able to show that receptor internalisation requires CR1 clustering on the plasma membrane rufﬂes but not on the clathrin - coated pits . CR1 receptor clustering is sensitive to treatment with cytochalasin , Plasma membrane Cytoskeletonrearrangement & membrane ruffling Ruffle folds back onto itself Macropinosome > 0 . 2 µ m in diameter Tubulation during early maturation Recycle back to the plasma membrane Maturemacropinosome Late endosome / Lysosome Figure 1 Pathway of macropinocytosis . Macropinocytosis involves actin cytoskeleton rearrangement at the plasma membrane leading to the formation of membrane rufﬂes . Rufﬂes may fold back onto themselves and fuse at the base of plasma membrane , trapping solute and soluble substances in macropinosomes . Early maturation of macropinosomes involve extensive tubulation resulting in mature macropinosomes that are more spherical . Content of the macropinosomes are then either degraded at the late endosome / lysosome or recycled back to the plasma membrane . The cytoskeleton is depicted as black lines . Macropinocytosis JP Lim and PA Gleeson 837 Immunology and Cell Biology an actin - disrupting agent . 25 Clustered CR1 receptors were then inter - nalised into the neutrophils via macropinocytosis . 22 The level of CR1 internalisation is enhanced by activation of the formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine receptors , a chemoattractant receptor . Carpentier et al . 22 proposed that the crosstalk between chemoattractant and CRs may have a physiological relevance at inﬂammatory sites whereby neutrophils that engulf pathogens are stimulated by high levels of chemoattractants . Chemotaxis may increase the level of pathogen ingestion by neutrophils via macropinocytosis . Antigen presentation Antigen presentation to T cells is a crucial step in evoking T - cell immune responses . Presentation of antigenic peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II molecules is a specialised function of antigen - presenting cells , such as dendritic cells and macrophages . In the immune system , macropinocytosis is means by which antigen - presenting cells sample their immediate environment for antigens . 12 – 14 Internalised antigens are then processed and anti - genic peptides loaded onto MHC molecules . The MHC – antigenic peptide complex is then presented on the surface of antigen - presenting cells to T - cell , thereby evoking downstream immune responses . 12 – 14 Indeed , macrophages undergo extensive constitutive macropinocytosis , internalising up to 200 % of their surface area every hour 26 while patrolling and sampling the environment for antigens . Although the major pathway for the loading of internalised antigens involves MHC class II molecules , loading of some antigenic peptides onto MHC class I molecules can also occur . 27 – 29 Normally , peptides found on MHC class I are of host cell origin ( endogenous antigens ) . However , exogenous antigens internalised via macropinocytosis can be cross - presented by dendritic cells 12 , 14 , 30 – 32 and macrophages 12 to T cells in a cholesterol - dependent manner . 33 Indeed , treatment with amiloride , an inhibitor of the macropinocytic pathway , 19 , 34 prevented cross - presentation as detected by in vitro T - cell stimulation assays . 12 , 30 – 32 In the case of dendritic cells , immature dendritic cells utilise macropinocytosis to sample large quantities of exogenous solute from their immediate environment for circulating antigens as part of their sentinel function . 13 By using ﬂuid phase markers , Sallusto et al . 13 showed that ﬂuid internalised by dendritic cells is delivered to MHC class II - positive compartments by macropinosomes . This MHC class II compartment is also positive for lysosomal - associated mem - brane protein 1 suggesting that the MHC class II molecules reside in the late endosome / lysosomal compartment of a non - stimulated , immature dendritic cell . On the other hand , the maturation of dendritic cells , a process stimulated by microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide and directed by Toll - like receptors , is associated with a downregulation of macropinocytosis . 13 MHC class II molecules and antigenic peptide then redistribute from the lysosomal compart - ment to the plasma membrane , 35 , 36 thus maximising the presentation of captured antigen to T cells 13 , 18 suggesting a strong correlation between macropinocytosis and antigen presentation on MHC class II molecules by the dendritic cells . It is interesting to note that although downregulation of macropinocytosis is the hallmark of dendritic cell maturation , there is a transient upregulation of macropinocytosis in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation before maturation of dendritic cells . This enhancement peaked after 30 or 45min of lipopolysaccharide stimulation in bone marrow - derived and splenic dendritic cells , respectively , ultimately leading to enhanced presenta - tion of antigen ( ovalbumin peptide ) on class I MHC and ( tetanus toxin C fragment ) on class II MHC molecules . 37 The transient peak in macropinocytosis after Toll - like receptor stimulation is considered to maximise antigen capture and presentation of relevant antigens associated with the inﬂammatory source . The importance of macropinocytosis in antigen presentation is also supported from studies using macropinocytic inhibitors . The admin - istration of amiloride , Sanglifehrin A or rapamycin , agents that inhibit macropinocytosis in vitro , also prevented macropinocytosis and T - cell proliferation in vivo . 38 – 40 It is important to note that although inhibition of macropinocytosis indicates that this endocytic pathway is important for antigen presentation , the direct effects of these drugs in vivo may not be speciﬁc . In addition to macropinocytosis and mannose receptor - endocytosis , 38 rapamycin also inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin that regulates a repertoire of physio - logical functions such as cell growth , motility and survival . Rapamycin has also been reported to inhibit signalling events , which downregu - lates translation and synthesis of actin . 41 The same argument can be applied to the use of Sanglifehrin A and amiloride in vivo . Sanglifehrin A has been shown to inhibit both endocytic activity and critical bioactive interleukin - 12 production in vitro 40 , 42 whereas amiloride is an inhibitor of the Na + / H + exchanger pump in the plasma membrane . Although amiloride has reported to selectively block macropinocytosis and not clathrin - dependent endocytic pathway when used at the appropriate concentration in vitro , 19 , 34 its effect on physiological processes , which require the proton pump in vivo remains unclear . Pathogen entry Numerous infectious pathogens such as the protozoa , bacteria , viruses and prions opportunistically exploit macropinocytosis to evade and invade the host immune system ( Table 1 ) . Indeed , pathogens have developed a variety of strategies to modify the host’s normal macro - pinocytic pathway to their own advantage . For example , the vaccinia virus induces macropinocytosis by mimicking apoptotic material . It does this by enveloping itself in phosphatidylserine - containing membrane of a dying , infected cell . In a normal healthy cell , phos - phatidylserine is abundant in the cytoplasmic leaf of the cell mem - brane and absent from the exofacial leaﬂet . Phosphatidylserine is only redistributed to the outer layer of the cell membrane when the cell is undergoing apoptosis . 43 Mercer et al . 44 proposed that when a cell is Table 1 Pathogens that utilise macropinocytosis to gain entry into host cells Classiﬁcation Pathogen References Protozoa Leishmania amazonesis 77 Bacteria Brucella spp . 78 Shigella spp . 79 , 80 Mycobacterium spp . 81 – 83 Salmonella spp . 46 , 47 , 84 Legionella spp . 85 Sphingomonas spp . 86 Virus Vaccinia 44 HIV - 1 87 – 89 Nipah 90 Adenovirus 91 , 92 Coxsackie 93 Kaposi’s sarcoma - associated herpesvirus 94 Ebolavirus 95 Infectious protein Prions 96 , 97 Abbreviation : HIV , human immunodeﬁciency virus . A list of pathogens that utilise the macropinocytic pathway to gain entry into the target host cell . Macropinocytosis JP Lim and PA Gleeson 838 Immunology and Cell Biology infected by vaccinia virus , the host cell displays apoptotic features including the presence of phosphatidylserine in the outer membrane leaﬂet . When the vaccinia virus buds off from its infected host cell , it is enveloped in a lipid bilayer coating , which contains phosphatidylserine on the outer membrane leaﬂet . 44 The vaccinia virus thus mimics an apoptotic body . Association of this ‘Trojan Horse’ vaccinia virus with the cell surface of an uninfected host cell stimulates the formation of large , transient plasma membrane blebs rather than membrane rufﬂes . Nonetheless , studies by Mercer et al . 44 showed that internalisation of mature virions had the general characteristics of induced macropino - cytosis such as a ﬁve - fold increased ﬂuid - phase dextran uptake associated with exposure to vaccinia virus . In addition , infectivity of the mature virions was reduced using N - ethyl - N - isopropyl - amiloride , an inhibitor of macropinocytosis . 19 , 34 Thus , Mercer et al . 44 proposed that vaccinia virus uses apoptotic mimicry and the upregulation of macropinocytosis to enter host cells allowing the internalisation of the virus to mediate another round of infection . Interestingly , phophatidylserine is not the only lipid used by viruses to support cell entry . Laliberte and Moss 45 revealed through the use of lipid - reconsti - tuted vaccinia viruses that the non - biologically D - stereoisomer of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylglycerol , which are not normally found on virion membranes , was as effective as phophatidylserine in reconstituting a new round of infectivity via macropinocytosis . In addition to viruses , bacteria such as the Salmonella spp . also manipulate the macropinocytic pathway to enter host cells . Salmo - nellae are bacteria that cause diseases such as typhoid fever and gastroenteritis in both humans and animals . In the case of typhoid fever , survival within macrophages is essential to pathogenesis . Studies involving time - lapse video microscopy revealed that generalised plasma membrane rufﬂing and macropinocytosis occurs within 2min of exposure of bone marrow - derived macrophages to Salmo - nella typhimurium . 46 Bacteria on the surface of macrophages get caught in the membrane rufﬂes as the rufﬂes close to form macro - pinosomes resulting on a considerable uptake of S . typhimurium . Interestingly , membrane rufﬂing occurs over a large surface of the macrophage unlike on epithelial cells where rufﬂing is localised to the site of contact between the bacterium and host cell . 46 , 47 Nonetheless , invasion of S . typhimurium into both macrophages and epithelial is achieved via the macropinocytic pathway . REGULATION OF MACROPINOCYTOSIS Considerable efforts have recently been made to elucidate the regulation of macropinocytosis . A key difference between clathrin - dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis is that the latter requires actin cytoskeleton reorganisation . Treatment with phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3 - kinase ) inhibitors or cytochalasin , an actin - disrupting agent , 25 has been shown to inhibit macropinocytosis but not the clathrin - dependent endocytic pathway . 48 , 49 The dynamics of actin cytoskeleton during macropinocytosis has been visualised in cells expressing ﬂuorescently labelled actin probes . Coronin is an actin - associated protein , which has a role in controlling actin dynamics during processes such as cell motility , phagocytosis and cytokinesis 50 – 52 in Dictyoselium discoideum . By expressing coro - nin – green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) in D . discoideum , actin dynamics was visualised during uptake of 70 - kDa dextran by macropinocyto - sis . 53 Coronin – GFP - rich protrusions were reported to emanate from the cell surface , forming a cup / crown containing dextran . Subse - quently , edges of the protrusions fused and a macropinosome , surrounded by coronin – GFP , was released into the cytoplasm . Within a minute after internalisation , the coronin coat was reported to dissociate from the macropinosome . 53 In a separate experiment , the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton in D . discoideum was observed using GFP - actin - binding domain probe . 54 , 55 This probe binds speciﬁcally to F - actin structures that are also recognised by phalloidin . Small , GFP - actin - binding domain protrusions were observed to fuse and engulf dextran into the cells . 54 The F - actin probe remained associated with the macropinosome but was completely lost 30 – 50s after vesicle closure 54 similar to that observed for coronin – GFP . 53 Actin reorganisation during macropinocytosis is not only limited to D . discoideum . Araki et al . 56 investigated the distribution of F - actin in mouse macrophages using actinin - 4 , a non - muscle form of a - actinin . 56 a - Actinin is an actin - binding protein , which cross - links F - actin into bundles or connects F - actin to the plasma membrane . Immunoﬂuorescence analyses revealed that lamellipodia stained posi - tive for actinin - 4 . Actinin - 4 was also associated with dextran - labelled macropinosomes and this association was found to decrease as the macropinosome matures . 56 The examples above in D . discoideum and macrophages clearly depict the importance of actin cytoskeleton reorganisation during macropinocytosis . Therefore , it is perhaps not surprising that com - ponents of signal transduction pathways linking receptor stimulation to actin cytoskeleton remodelling are also implicated as regulators of macropinocytosis ( Table 2 ) . One such candidate is the Ras oncogene . Microinjection of oncogenic H - ras into rat embryo ﬁbroblasts resulted in a marked increase in cell surface rufﬂing and macropinocytosis . 57 Conversely , microinjection of antibodies that bind speciﬁcally to ras proteins into ﬁbroblasts transformed with ras oncogene inhibited membrane rufﬂing and macropinocytosis . 58 Table 2 Regulators of macropinocytosis Regulator Localisation during macropinocytosis References Ras Plasma membrane 57 , 58 Src Plasma membrane and macropinosome 60 , 98 – 101 PI3 - kinase Plasma membrane 34 48 , 59 , 60 Phosphoinositide 5 - kinase ( PIKfyve ) Macropinosomes 102 Phospholipase C ( PLC ) Unknown 60 SH3 - containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( SGEF ) Plasma membrane 103 Rab34 Plasma membrane and macropinosome 104 , 105 Rab5 Plasma membrane and macropinosome 106 – 108 Rabankyrin - 5 Macropinosome 108 ADP - ribosylation factor 6 ( ARF6 ) Plasma membrane 109 – 112 Rac Plasma membrane 109 and macropinosome 113 34 , 113 – 115 Cdc42 Unknown 34 , 116 p21 - activated kinase 1 ( PAK1 ) Plasma membrane and macropinosome 11 , 117 C - terminal - binding protein - 1 / brefeldinA - ADP ribosylated substrate ( CtBP1 / BARS ) Plasma membrane 118 , 119 Switch - associated protein 70 ( SWAP - 70 ) Macropinosome 113 Sorting nexin 1 ( SNX1 ) Macropinosomes 70 Sorting nexin 5 ( SNX5 ) Plasma membrane and macropinosomes 18 , 62 , 66 Sorting nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) Macropinosomes 70 Sorting nexin 18 ( SNX18 ) Macropinosomes 70 Sorting nexin 33 ( SNX33 ) Cytosolic 70 Regulators of macropinocytosis and their respective subcellular localisation during macropinocytosis . Macropinocytosis JP Lim and PA Gleeson 839 Immunology and Cell Biology Remodelling of the cytoskeleton during macropinocytosis requires the activity of PI3 - kinase . 48 , 59 – 61 Treatment of cells using PI3 - kinase inhibitors such as wortmannin and LY294002 has been reported to reduce ﬂuid - phase uptake via macropinocytosis . 48 , 59 , 60 In the case of bone marrow - derived macrophages , PI3 - kinase activity was not required for cell surface rufﬂing but rather for the closure of macro - pinosomes . 48 Macrophages that have been treated with wortmannin or LY294002 still exhibited formation of circular rufﬂes but these rufﬂes receded into the cytoplasm without closing into macropino - somes . PI3 - kinase is a core signalling component in multiple signal transduction pathways such as endocytosis , membrane trafﬁc and cell proliferation and inhibition of its activity will result in a range of other effects . Hence , inhibition of PI3 - kinase to study macropinocytosis should be interpreted with caution . Amiloride or its more potent counterpart , dimethyl amiloride , is an inhibitor of the Na + / H + exchanger pump in the plasma membrane . It has been reported to selectively block macropinocytosis , and not the clathrin - dependent endocytic pathway , when used at the appropriate concentration . 19 , 34 Thus , amiloride is gaining popularity as a tool to study macropinocytosis . It has recently been proposed that macro - pinocytosis is not directly sensitive to amiloride ; rather , macropino - cytosis is affected by acidiﬁcation from excessive localised H + production at the site of macropinocytosis when the regulatory action of Na + / H + exchanger pump is impaired by amiloride . Acidiﬁcation does not inhibit receptor activation nor PI3 - kinase localisation and activation but it does affect downstream localisation and activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 ; GTPases required for actin remodelling . 34 Once again , ﬁndings which reiterate the importance of cytoskeleton remo - delling in macropinocytosis . Recently , members of the sorting nexin ( SNX ) family have been localised to macropinosomes and also implicated in macropinosome formation . Like other members of the SNX family of proteins , SNX5 is characterised by the presence of a lipid - binding PX domain . The PX domain of SNX5 has been shown to bind preferentially to PI ( 3 ) P and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . 62 To identify the subcellular localisation of SNX5 , Merino - Trigo et al . 62 generated HEK293 cells that stably expressing full - length SNX5 fused to GFP ( HEK – GFP – SNX5 cells ) . GFP – SNX5 was localised to the endosomes of non - stimulated cells in a wortman - nin - sensitive manner . On EGF stimulation , GFP – SNX5 was also observed on the plasma membrane . This coincided with the dual phosphoinositide speciﬁcity of the PX domain given that early endosomes are PI ( 3 ) P - rich whereas PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is localised predomi - nantly on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane especially after receptor stimulation . 63 – 65 In addition , EGF stimulation of HEK – GFP – SNX5 cells also resulted in the formation of enlarged endosomal structures that are positive for GFP – SNX5 and EEA1 , 62 endosomal structures identiﬁed as macropinosomes . 18 Further , Kerr et al . 18 reported that GFP – SNX5 was initially sequestered to discrete sub - domains of macropinosomes . Subsequent maturation of macropino - somes then involved highly dynamic extensions of SNX5 - labelled tubules away from the macropinosome body . 18 This tubulation process was followed by a reduction in the surface area of the macropinosome as it matured into a Rab7 - positive structure , which eventually fused with late endosomes / lysosomes . To further investigate the relationship between SNX5 and macro - pinocytosis , Lim et al . 66 examined the formation of macropinosomes in HEK – GFP – SNX5 stable cells , which have elevated levels of SNX5 compared with the parental cell line . Constitutive as well as EGF - stimulated macropinocytosis were signiﬁcantly increased in HEK – GFP – SNX5 stable cells . On the other hand , the rate of macro - pinosome maturation was not affected by elevated levels of SNX5 . 66 Therefore , the increase in macropinocytosis observed in HEK – GFP – SNX5 cells was not due to a delay in the kinetics of macropinosome maturation but rather due to an increased formation of macropino - somes . These studies have indicated that SNX5 may have an important role in the regulation of macropinocytosis . How might SNX5 regulate macropinocytosis ? A model of macro - pinocytosis involving SNX5 in HEK293 cells has been proposed . 18 , 66 EGF - R activation will trigger a downstream signalling cascade , which involves elevated levels of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 possibly through the activity of PI3 - kinase . A 5 ¢ - phosphatase then acts on PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to generate PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , which in turn acts as a signal , recruiting SNX5 to discrete patches on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane via its phosphoinositide - binding PX domain . There is a direct relationship between the level of cell surface SNX5 protein and macropinocytic activity , highlighting the role for this sorting nexin in driving this signal - activated endocytic pathway . SNX5 has a C - terminal BAR domain in addition to the PX domain . 67 The BAR domain has been hypothesised to have a direct role in deforming membrane , causing it to curve or act as a membrane curvature sensor . 68 , 69 SNX5 , either functioning alone or as a yet to be identiﬁed complex , may act to distort the plasma membrane thereby generating a macropinocytic pit , which then buds off from the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane forming a macropinosome . As the macropinosome matures , the BAR domain of SNX5 , possibly in a complex with other sorting nexins such as SNX1 , 68 distorts the limiting membrane of the macropinosome into extensive tubular elements that subse - quently separate from the macropinosome . 18 It is not yet known if SNX5 may regulate macropinocytosis through cytoskeleton remodelling . In a recent study , 12 members of the SNX – PX – BAR family were screened in an assay to determine the effect of their overexpression on macropinosome formation . 70 SNX1 , SNX5 , SNX9 , SNX18 and SNX33 were all found to elevate macropinosome formation , an effect that appeared dependent on the increase in PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels , which is regulated by PI3 - kinase activity . 70 As discussed earlier , PI3 - kinase , Ras , Rac1 and Cdc42 , as well as sorting nexins , are some examples of macropinocytic regulators . Additional molecules , which are com - ponents of the signal transduction pathway , and which have been implicated in macropinocytosis are listed in ( Table 2 ) . Nonetheless it is unclear how these different components are collectively organised to regulate the process of macropinocytosis . CONCLUSIONS Although macropinocytosis was initially viewed as a non - regulated process , it is now clear that this internalisation pathway is a highly regulated form of endocytosis . Macropinocytosis consists of a series of co - ordinated signalling events involving remodelling of the cyto - skeleton . Although an increasing number of regulators have been identiﬁed , the exact sequence of how the different components co - ordinate macropinocytosis remains to be discovered . A greater understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of macropinocytosis would provide insight into the physiological control of macropino - cytosis . Also of importance is the ﬁnding that pathogens have the ability to hijack macropinocytosis as a mean to invade host cells and evade an immune response . A better understanding of how pathogens manipulate macropinocytosis should enable development of thera - peutics to block pathogen entry and infection . Macropinocytosis also provides an effective mechanism for drug delivery into cells . Numerous arginine - rich cell - penetrating peptides such as octo - arginine and human immunodeﬁciency virus – trans - activator of transcription ( TAT ) peptides have been used as carriers Macropinocytosis JP Lim and PA Gleeson 840 Immunology and Cell Biology to deliver peptides and proteins into cells via macropinocytosis . 71 , 72 This is exempliﬁed by the use of an arginine - rich peptide CAYHRLRRC , which binds to leukaemia - derived and lymphoma - derived cells and is internalised via the macropinocytic pathway . 73 Conversely , treatment with macropinocytic inhibitors such as wort - mannin and amiloride signiﬁcantly inhibited the internalisation of the peptide . By conjugating a pro - apoptotic peptide to the CAYHRLRRC peptide , the pro - apoptotic peptide was also successfully delivered into leukaemia and lymphoma cell lines . The result was selective death of leukaemia and lymphoma cells . 73 Thus , tumour cells can be selectively targeted and killed using cell - penetrating peptide delivery of thera - peutics introduced via the macropinocytic pathway . In addition to arginine - rich peptides , uptake of engineered particles ( such as recom - binant virus - like particles ) and DNA in complex with proteoglycans ( for the purpose of gene - therapy and DNA - based vaccinations ) have also been shown to occur through macropinocytosis . 74 , 75 Thus , there is a potential for the macropinocytic pathway to be utilised for the administration of drugs and other therapeutic agents . Most of the current information on macropinocytosis has been acquired through investigations using cultured cells . Very few studies have investigated macropinocytosis in whole organisms and hence there remain considerable gaps in our knowledge of the relevance of macropinocytosis in physiological systems . Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the cell biology of macro - pinocytosis there remain many unanswered questions . How do the different regulators of macropinocytosis co - ordinate this complex process ? Are the same regulators involved in constitutive and stimu - lated macropinocytosis ? What sorting events are associated with the formation and the maturation of macropinocytosis ? Does cargo selection occur in the macropinocytic cups as suggested by the studies using the soil amoeba D . discoideum ? 76 Do these sorting events contribute to the evasion of pathogens from the immune detection ? How is the ultimate fate of macropinosomes determined as this appears to differ between cell types ? 15 , 17 – 19 It will be important to develop strategies to perturb macropino - cytosis in vivo and analyse the importance of this endocytic pathway in a range of different cell activities . The use of current inhibitors of macropinocytosis has major limitations as discussed in the review . On the other hand , knowledge of the regulators of macropinocytosis now opens the possibility of genetic manipulation of organisms to perturb the macropinocytosis pathway in vivo . Analysis of macropinocytosis in specialised cells of whole organisms will directly reveal the contribu - tion of this dynamic pathway in processes such as antigen presentation and tumour cell motility within a physiological context . 1 Mousavi SA , Malerod L , Berg T , Kjeken R .
