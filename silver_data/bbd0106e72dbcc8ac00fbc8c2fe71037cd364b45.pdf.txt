The bilayer bending rigidities were measured for the same spherical vesicles with two methods , fluctuation mode analysis and electric deformation . In some of the sample cells the glue sealing the cell was in direct contact with the sample , in others the sample was shielded from the glue by a silicone grease . The values of the rigidity , wlfile being lowest and practically equal for the unshielded samples , differed significantly between methods for the slfielded ones . We also measured the temperature dependence of the bending rigidity . The dependence of the rigidity on method seems to suggest the existence of a membrane superstructure . 1 . Introduction The bending rigidities of single fluid bilayers of various phosphatidylcholines and other lipids have been measured with many methods . In most cases , they were determined from the mean square amplitudes of bending fluctuation modes . The objects studied were tubular vesicles [ 1 - 4 ] , spherical vesicles [ 2 , 5 - 8 ] and sections of very large membranes [ 4 ] . In other experiments , the bending rigidity was obtained from an apparent increase of the membrane area with lateral tension . This effect is due to the leveling of thermal undulations which at low enough tensions dominates over real ( Hookean ) stretching . The tensions were produced either by sucking a small part of a vesicle into a micropipette [ 9 ] or by deforming a vesicle through electric fields [ 10 ] . Finally , the bending rigidity was derived from strong curvatures produced by external forces . In those experiments a very thin bilayer tube , called tether , was pulled from a vesicle held by a micropipette iii ] . The results of these measurements are remarkable in two respects . Firstly , very different values of the bending rigidity ~ have been found in different sets of experiments . The variation is the largest for egg yolk phosphatidylcholine ( EYPC ) , a favorite material of the early days , the reported averages ranging from ~ = 2 . 3 x 10 ~ ~ ~ J [ 1 ] to 0 . 24 x 10 ~ ~ ~ J [ 10 ] . It is not clear whether the variation resulted from the change in experimental methods or from differences in bilayer composition . Natural lipids are variable and even one - component lipids , mostly used as purchased , need not be completely pure . Additional impurities may enter during sample © Les Editions de Physique 1995 414 JOURNAL DE PHYSIQUE II N°3 preparation , in particular from glues and other materials that seal the sample cell , or may appear gradually as a consequence of chemical degradation . Angelova et al . [ 12 ] , studying the fluctuations of spherical vesicles , found a decrease of the bending rigidity of EYPC bilayers from ( 0 . 66 + 0 . 06 ) to ( 0 . 45 + 0 . 05 ) x 10 ~ ~ ~ J in the course of two weeks . So far , there have been no measurements of the bending rigidity in which two different methods were applied to the same vesicle . Secondly , it seems to be typical of these studies that the experimental error of the bending rigidity for an individual vesicle is smaller than the scatter of the results for different vesicles . In general , the half width of the distribution is more than a third of its mean value . The only exceptions from this rule might be the micropipette experiments [ 9 , 11 ] . However , it should be noted that in the study involving tethers the scatter among vesicles was also larger than individual errors . In the following , we report comparative measurements of the bending rigidity of phospha - tidylcholine bilayers . We studied the mean square fluctuation amplitudes and the electric deformation of the same spherical vesicles made of1 - stearoyl - 2 - oleoyl , sn - phosphatidylcholine ( SOPC ) , 1 , 2 - dioloeoyl - sn - phosphatidylcholine ( DOPC ) or 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - phosphati - dylcholine ( POPC ) . Some of the sample cells , containing SOPC or DOPC , were sealed with a glue in direct contact to the water . In the other sample cells , containing DOPC or POPC , the vesicle suspension was shielded from the glue by a barrier of silicone grease . The bending rigidities were found to be the lowest and insensitive to method when glue and water were in contact . They were higher and , in the first place , depended markedly on method when glue and water were separated by the silicone grease . In additional experiments we varied the temperature of the sample . Employing fluctuation mode analysis of spherical DOPC vesicles , we found the bending rigidity to decrease dramati - cally with temperature . The discussion of the results centers on the comparative measurements , I . e , the dependence of the bending rigidity of the same vesicle on experimental method . We argue that the dis - agreement between methods cannot be explained by existing theories of membrane bending fluctuations , including the recent hat model [ 13 , 14 ] . Rather , it seems to confirm earlier ideas of a membrane superstructure . The latter may also be involved in the sensitivity of the rigidity to direct contact between glue and water and to changes of temperature . 2 . Materials and Methods The phospholipids were delivered in chloroform solution ( Sigma Chemical , Deisenhofen , Ger - many ) and used without further purification The purity of the lipids indicated by the dis - tributor was 99 % . We diluted the lipid solution in chloroform to mg / ml and stored it below - 20 °C . Each lipid was taken every time from the same respective solution in chloroform and no dependence on storage time of the measured bending rigidities was noted . Giant vesicles were prepared by standard procedures [ 15 , 16 ] . A small amount of the lipid solution was spread on the bottom of a beaker or directly on the object slide of the sample cell and left overnight under vacuum so that the chloroform could evaporate . The lipid started to swell spontaneously when it was covered with water . All the water used in the experiments was ion depleted ( Ser - adest ) and contained ca . 100 pM NaN3 to prevent bacterial contamination and ensure a small Debye length . The sample cells for comparative measurements , like those used previously for electric de - formation only [ 10 ] , were equipped with two parallel 0 . 25 mm wide platinum wires serving as spacers and electrodes . A droplet taken from the vesicle suspension after at least two days of swelling was transferred from the beaker into a drop of water on the object slide of the sample N°3 DEPENDENCE OF BENDING RIGIDITY ON METHOD 415 cell . Alternatively , the lipid swelled in the sample cell , forming free vesicles and other mem - brane structures within hours . The latter procedure often resulted in tight spheres , but visible fluctuations developed in the course of days . No effect on ~ of vesicle preparation was noticed . A flat ring cut out of a 50 pm thick mylar film was used as spacer when the temperature dependence was measured . In these experiments , the lipid always swelled in the sample cell . The gap between object slide and cover slip was sealed with Eukitt ( Kindler , Freiburg , Germany ) to prevent evaporation of the water . This glue was selected earlier [ 17 ] because , in contrast to others , it has little effect on the pH of water , giving pH = 6 . However , it contains xylene besides a polymeric acrylate . Although practically insoluble in water , xylene may accumulate in the lipid bilayers . In the present experiments contact between glue and water was avoided in part of the sample cells for comparative measurements by applying a shield of silicone vacuum grease ( Lithelen , Leybold - Heraeus ) . The mylar ring separated glue and water in the cells built for measuring the temperature dependence . The samples were observed with a phase contrast microsope , the numerical aperture of the objective being 0 . 75 . The object stage could be brought to the desired temperature with an accuracy of 0 . 1 °C . No measurements were done above 45 °C because of strong convection currents at elevated temperatures . The images of the fluctuating vesicle were taken with a CCD camera ( Pullnix , TM 700 , England ) and could be recorded on a VHS video tape recorder or a video printer . An image processing system ( Engel und Stiefvater , Karlsruhe , Germany ) was connected to a parallel personal computer ( Proteus , Karlsruhe , Germany ) with a 68030 Host Processor ( Motorola ) and seven parallel processors IT 800 ) . This system digitized the pictures from the CCD camera into 512 x 512 pixels with 8 bit resolution for the gray levels and stored them in the memory of a computer . One pixel corresponded to about 127 nm . The video integration time of an image was 40 ms . The time interval between subsequent pictures was made long enough to ensure negligible correlation for the slowest fluctuation mode Depending on vesicle radius , it was usually several seconds . The number of pictures for each measurement was in general 500 and never less than 300 . We developed a special algorithm to determine the contour . Spurious noise of the contour was reduced by a method similar to that of Faucon et al . [ 7 ] . In this procedure the experimental contour was approximated by its first four or five Fourier modes . Only those signal points were taken into account which were closer than a certain distance to this artificial contour . The approximately 500 images of a vesicle were used to obtain the autocorrelation function of its contour which was then decomposed into Legendre polynamials . We calculated the bending rigidity ~ ( l ) for each of these compound modes from the coefficient El of the I - th polynomial by use of [ 7 ] ~ ~ ~ ~ 4 ~ i Ii 1 ) ( 1 / ~ i + l ( 1 + 1 ) ] ~ ~ ~ The parameter n = ~ R ~ / ~ introduces a lateral tension ~ of the membrane , R being the vesicle radius . The values of lateral tension and pixel noise were chosen such as to obtain a plateau of ~ ( l ) extending over the first 10 to 20 modes . Another adjustment was made , when necessary , for the video integration time . In all this , we closely followed Faucon et al . [ 7 ] . The method of fluctuation mode analysis was checked by analyzing numerically simulated fluctuations of a spherical vesicle . The electric field deforming the spherical vesicles had a frequency of 2 kHz and ranged up to 100 V / cm . In order to evaluate the deformations we did not use photographs as in the previous experiments [ 10 ] . Instead , we recorded five contours of the vesicle for each field strength and computed from them the major axes of the contour which was practically an 416 JOURNAL DE PHYSIQUE II N°3 ellipse . The lateral tension acting on the undulations was obtained as before [ 10 ] from the equatorial Maxwell stress ~ ~ rr ~ eq ~ jfwf0 ~ 0 ' ~ ~ acting on the membrane from the outside of the nearly spherical vesicle , and the normal force equation ( Cl + C2 ) eq ~ h ( Trr ) eq " ( Cl + C2 ) pole ~ h Here ew = 80 is the dielectric constant of water , Eo is the r , m . s . strength of the homogeneous electric field far away from the vesicle , ci and c2 are the principal curvatures of the membrane taken either at the equator ( eq ) or the pole , and ~ h is the homogeneous lateral tension to be computed . The apparent relative increase in area , 1hA IA , caused by the leveling of undulations obeys [ 18 ] where the ositive parameter ~ o is obtained by extrapolation and can be larger than the ctual lateral ension at zero field strength . the bending rigidity is given by the slope AA IA plotted uers ~ s the of ~ h . inor orrections of this amounting to less than 5 % arise from a real tretching of the bilayer and a weakening of the ( Trr ) ~ q with the their description [ 10 ] . The initial lateral tension , either ~ or ao , had to be low in both kinds We used only vesicles where hese tensions were smaller than io ~ s mN / m . In addition , only free vesicles with diameters between 8 and 80 pm were selected . For very vesicle , analysis was done first and ollowed immediately by electric deformation . We checked in some cases that a subsequent repetition of luctuation mode analysis gave 3 . Results Comparative measurements of the bending rigidity , subjecting the same spherical vesicle to fluctuation mode analysis and electric deformation , were made on samples without and with silicone shield . Figure i shows as an example the results obtained with an unshielded sample . The values ~ ( l ) computed from the mean square fluctuation amplitudes of the Legendre modes are displayed in Figure ia . They are corrected as described above for lateral tension and pixel noise . In this example the radius ( 8 pm ) and , thus , the fluctuation amplitudes were rather small . The modes beyond the twelfth could not be adequately resolved and were therefore not considered in calculating the corrections . The data of the electric deformation experiment are plotted in Figure 16 . The slope of the straight line as obtained by a least squares fit gives the bending rigidity when inserted in equation ( 2 ) . Table I lists the bending rigidities found in comparative measurements with unshielded sam - ples of SOPC or DOPC . Inspection shows that for each of the five vesicles the two values of the bending rigidity are in good agreement . One of the SOPC vesicles was apparently bilamellar , and we divided its bending rigidity by 2 when taking the averages . For both materials , the results were confirmed by several vesicles whose bending rigidity could be measured with one N°3 DEPENDENCE OF BENDING RIGIDITY ON METHOD 417 ~ 0 . 4 I ~ 0 . 3 ~ ' Cl flf ' ~ b0 ~ ~ ii I J ~ 0 . 0 1 a ) 418 JOURNAL DE PHYSIQUE II N°3 Table I .

The old data for SOPC and DOPC agree within the errors with the new results , while those for POPC have no counterpart in the present study . Table II lists the results of comparative measurements with silicone shielded samples of DOPC and POPC . In contrast to unshielded samples , the bending rigidities now depend sig - nificantly and systematically on method . They are larger with electric deformation than with fluctuation mode analysis , the ratio of the two values being on average 2 . 5 for DOPC and 1 . 5 for POPC . The bending rigidity of DOPC was measured not only by both methods but also in shielded and unshielded samples . Moreover , the fluctuation mode analysis was done with and without silicone barrier also for POPC if we include the previous results ( see above ) . For both lipids , mode analysis yielded larger values ( by factors of I - s for DOPC and 1 . 7 for POPC ) with barrier than without it . However , the emphasis of the present work is on the comparative measurements , I . e . the results obtained by the two experimental methods from the same vesicle . In the case of DOPC we measured the bilayer bending rigidity also as a function of temper - ature , preparing the vesicles in sample cells with a mylar spacer and using fluctuation mode analysis only . The data for a particular vesicle are plotted in Figure 2 . Evidently , the bending rigidity drops strongly with temperature , decreasing by factors of five between 13 and 34 °C . This very strong dependence cannot be a pretransitional effect as the range of temperatures was far above the main transition of DOPC at - 21 °C ( 21 ] .

As a rule , two or more buds were not separate but arranged in a string of spheres connected to each other and the big sphere by optically irresolvable constrictions . The buds appeared to be stable while the pictures were taken at a given temperature . 4 . Discussion Small fractions of dissolved impurities are unlikely to have a large effect on the intrinsic bending rigidity of a fluid membrane . However , theories predict that impurity molecules even at rather small concentrations greatly decrease the effective bending rigidity if they possess a local spontaneous curvature very different from that of the host . The spontaneous curvature of a symmetric bilayer is zero by definition . ( It remains zero on average in the presence of impurities producing local spontaneous bilayer curvature if their concentrations are equal on both sides of the bilayer . ) The effective bending rigidity of mixed monolayers and bilayers has been treated in terms of continuum models [ 22 , 23 ] and the so - called hat model [ 13 , 14 ] . The hat model has been worked out in some detail for membranes with a flat mean surface such as symmetric bilayers . In this model each molecule in a monolayer , or pair of opposite molecules in a bilayer , is taken to be a spherical cap . The curvature of this cap fluctuates about its spontaneous value . The spherical cap and a smoothly attached axisymmetric brim of zero mean curvature together make up a hat . Like the nonlocal bending modes of the continuum model , the hats can be superimposed as long as the fluctuating membrane makes small enough angles with the flat surface about which it fluctuates . The decrease of the effective bending rigidity is calculated from the adjustment of surfactant concentrations to membrane curvature in the continuum model . It is derived from the en - hancement of local bending fluctuations by the diffusion of surfactant molecules with different spontaneous cap curvatures in the hat model . The two models yield essentially the same results for monolayers . The hat model has the advantage of providing a microscopic description of mixed monolayers , including their athermal roughness . Also , it permits a treatment of local bending irustration and athermal roughness in mixed bilayers [ 14 ] . Based on those theories , one expects the purest bilayer of a given lipid to have the highest bending rigidity . For comparison , we note that other authors found ~ = 0 . 9 x 10 ~ ~ ~ J from apparent stretching [ 9 ] and ~ = l . 2 x10 ~ ~ ~ J from the pulling of tethers ill ] for SOPC as well as ~ = lA x 10 ~ ~ ~ J from fluctuation mode analysis for both POPC and SOPC [ 8 ] . A high concentration of impurity molecules producing rather pointed hats in the bilayer would be needed to reduce the effective bending rigidity to the much smaller values which we measured in unshielded samples of SOPC and ( previously ) POPC . This can be seen from the estimates given in the Appendix . However , impurities cannot explain why , in shielded samples , we found distinctly different values of the bending rigidity with the same vesicle when we changed the experimental method . One may wonder whether the discrepancies are removed if the hat model is employed instead of the more familiar continuum model . We will show in the Appendix that this is not so . The natural alternative to hats are saddles . A bilayer superstructure consisting of cooperative local saddles has already been postulated a few years ago [ 13 ] . Disordered arrays of saddles seem suited to explain an extraordinary membrane roughness which was inferred from experimental studies of the mutual adhesion induced by lateral tension as observed with PC and other lipid membranes [ 24 - 26 ] . Hats were ruled out since they not only store area but also reduce the bending rigidity . The capability of the bilayer to form saddles , which should automatically be cooperative , was attributed to higher order bending elasticity . Some pictures of grainy egg yolk PC membranes obtained in transmission electron cryomicroscopy seem to show a disordered 422 JOURNAL DE PHYSIQUE II N°3 superstructure [ 27 ] and prompted , when seen for the first time , the proposal of cooperative saddles as its elements . In order to exp1aln a dependence of the bending rigidity on method , we may speculate that a superstructure with short - range order gives rise to the formation of relatively rigid " floats " in the fluid bilayer . They could weaken undulations of wavelengths smaller than their size . For a tentative assessment of a suitable size of the floats we make use of the formula ( ~ = ~ / ~ ( 3 ) which relates the deflection length ( to bending rigidity and lateral tension of the membrane [ 24 ] . On one hand , the floats should not be much smaller than the deflection length ( so that a range of fluctuation modes with wavelengths near ( are significantly reduced by their presence . The lateral tensions occurring in the electric deformation of vesicles are on the order of10 ~ ~ mN / m . Inserting this value and ~ = 10 ~ ~ ~ J into ( 3 ) , ~ ve compute ( = 3 ~ m . On the other hand , the floats should be smaller than the wavelengths used in the fluctuation mode analysis , so that this method gives the same values of the bending rigidity for all modes accessible to it , I - e - for all wavelengths larger than ca . 4 ~ m . We niay conclude from these estimates that the two conditions to be satisfied by the size of the floats are approximately compatible . If the envisaged superstructure of the bilayers does exist , the bending rigidity could be very sensitive to temperature changes and impurities , for instance through the size and shape of the floats . Rigid floats should increase the stiffness over that of the fully fluid membrane if they are flat . However , if they are bent they may in addition act as hats so that the effective bending rigidity can , in principle , be raised or lowered by their presence . Since practically equal rigidities were measured with fluctuation Diode analysis and electric deformation in unshielded samples , any floats there would have to be much smaller than the deflection length ( . The absence of large floats appears consistent with the fact that the bending rigidity was minimal in unshielded samples . In order to explain the dramatic increase of the bending rigidity of DOPC bilayers with temperature , one could try to employ the hat model of mixed membranes without invoking a superstructure . However ~ hats created by impurity molecules are not likely to change in concentration or cap curvature to the extent required for a fivefold increase of the flexibility over a temperature interval of only 20 K . 5 . Conclusion The comparative measurements in samples with a silicone shield between glue and water have shown that electric deformation yields larger values of the bilayer bending rigidity than fluc - tuation mode analysis when the two methods are applied to the same DOPC or SOPC vesicle . The average ratios between the two rigidity values are 2 . 5 for DOPC and 1 . 5 for SOPC . In contrast , no dependence on method was noted m DOPC or POPC samples with direct contact of glue and water , a situation in which the bending rigidities are minimal . We have discussed m detail why a dependence of the bending rigidity on experimental method cannot be understood m terms of existing theories , which points to the existence of a superstructure of the bilayers . The very strong effect of temperature on the bilayer bending rigidity , as found by fluctuation mode analysis for DOPC vesicles , suggests an activation energy of 1 x 10 ~ ~ ~ J . The associated decrease of the rigidity by a factor of two between 18 to 25°C , I e . in the range of room temperature , might explain part of the experimental scatter observed in measurements of the bending rigidity . T ' he emphasis of the present study is on the comparative measurements and the evidence for a membrane superstructure which they seem to provide . The other observations were N°3 DEPENDENCE OF BENDING RIGIDITY ON METHOD 423 included because they too are difficult to interpret in terms of theories of mixed membranes . We have introduced the concept of floats in an attempt to explain the dependence of the bending rigidity on experimental method . The cooperative saddles underlying our model of the superstructure , when they are fully ordered , should form a pattern similar to an egg carton instead of uncorrelated floats [ 13 , 28 ] Appendix A Let us first briefly review the hat model [ 13 , 14 ] . Instead of some set of nonlocal modes , the hat model employs local bending modes to describe the bending fluctuations of fluid membranes . Each molecule in a monolayer , or pair of opposite molecules in a bilayer , is thought to be a spherical cap surrounded by a smoothly attached brim of zero total curvature , I . e . ci + c2 = 0 . Local bending fluctuations are produced by the fluctuations of the cap curvatures and by the diffusion of molecules with different spontaneous cap curvatures . The bending fluctuations of a cap obey the equipartition theorem in the form ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ° ~ ~ ~ bend ~ ° ~ ~ ~ ~ ' ~ ~ Here J = ci + c2 is the total curvature , Jo is the spontaneous curvature of the spherical cap , vanishing for the symmetric bilayer , and Ao is the area of the molecular cross section . We omit the Gaussian curvature , assuming its elastic modulus to be the same for all surfactant molecules . The effect of a nonuniform modulus of Gaussian curvature on hat formation has been briefly discussed elsewhere [ 14 ] . Solving ( A . 1 ) for the flexibility 1 / ~ and adding the fluctuations of the local curvature due to diffusion , we obtain the effective flexibility efl ' ~ ~ ~ ° ~ ~ ~ bend ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ° ~ ~ ~ difl ' j ~ ) ~ ~ ' ~ ~ According to this equation , the flexibility consists of an intrinsic part which is related to the bending fluctuations of the caps and a diffusive part which can enter only in the case of mixed membranes . The spontaneous curvature Jo is the average of the molecular spontaneous curva - tures . The intrinsic part is an average over the molecular flexibilities and readily generalized to the case of different molecular areas . The diffusive part is easy to handle only for random mixing of molecules of equal area Ao . It is a basic assumption of the hat model that the super - position principle applies to the normal displacements associated with all the hats . The hat model and continuum theory [ 22 , 23 ] predict the same bending rigidities for mixed membranes . Next , we want to calculate the extra area1hAh stored by a single hat in an otherwise flat membrane . Introducing the radius ro and the boundary angle po " ( J / 2 ) ro of a spherical cap of total curvature J , we may write , for p ( < 1 , 1 R ~ 2 l ~ Ah " ~ @ ( 27Tr dr ( A . 3 ) 2 ~ r Here r is the distance from the center of the hat and arR2 the area of the membrane imagined to be a circle of radius R .

Subtracting 1hAh without tension from 1hAh with tension , one immediately recovers from ( A . 6 ) and ( 3 ) the logarithmic dependence of the apparent area dilation on lateral tension as given by ( 2 ) . Equation ( A . 6 ) holds only if the lateral tension does not deform the spherical cap of the hat , I . e . for ( » ro . This condition was easily satisfied in the experiments because the deflection length ( is of the order of 3 ~ m for ~ = 10 ~ ~ ~ J and ~ = 10 ~ 5 mN / m . The diffusive contribution to the flexibility , I . e . the flexibility of mixed membranes , has so far been considered for uniform curvatures . It seems obvious that the results are valid for a periodic deformation only if its wavelength is much larger than the average spacing of the molecules of each kind . The typical values of the wavelength estimated above are about 4 pm . This is indeed much larger than the 40 nm spacing of impurities as computed , e . g . , from an impurity concentration of I % and a lipid molecular cross section of 0 . 7 nm2 . Let us estimate the r - m - s , boundary angle in a pure one - component bilayer , putting ~ = x 10 ~ ~ ~ J and kT = 4 x 10 ~ ~ ~ J ( room temperature ) . We obtain from ( A . 1 ) Note that ro cancels out in the calculation . If impurity molecules are to double this flexibility by inducing a local spontaneous curvature in the bilayer , they must have a boundary angle po " 10° at a relative concentration of10 % , as may be derived from ( A . 2 ) and ( A . 5 ) . Note that the square of the required curvature is inversely proportional to the relative impurity concentration if the latter is much smaller than unity .
