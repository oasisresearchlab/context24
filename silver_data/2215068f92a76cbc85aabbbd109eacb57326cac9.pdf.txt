In this short review , I will discuss recent progress in understanding the pathways followed by animal viruses into cells , and how these studies are also providing novel insights into our understanding of some molecular mechanisms that control endocytic membrane transport .

All rights reserved . DOI 10 . 1016 / j . ceb . 2009 . 03 . 008 The endocytic pathway Cell surface lipids and proteins as well as solutes are endocytosed into animal cells through several routes , including clathrin - coated pits and vesicles , caveolae or pathways that do not depend on caveolae or clathrin [ 1 ] , in particular clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) [ 2 ] or related GPI - enriched endocytic compartments ( GEECs ) [ 3 ] . While different proteins are sorted into these differ - ent pathways , for example the transferrin receptor into clathrin - coated pits , a given receptor may also be inter - nalized via different pathways depending on whether it triggers a signaling response or is destined for lysosomes [ 4 ] . Nevertheless , all endocytic routes are thought to converge on conventional endosomes , including caveolae whose interactions with endosomes are regulated [ 5 ] . It is not clear why receptors that have been internalized via separate pathways would then meet again in early endo - somes . However , evidence supports the notion that early endosomes contain different subpopulations or different regions and membrane domains , which presumably con - trol the trafﬁcking of signaling receptors [ 4 , 6 ] . While traveling along the endocytic pathway , these continue to signal when associated with specialized subpopulations or regions of endosomes [ 4 , 7 ] . This may explain how some growth factors can elicit a complex , sometimes diverse , response through waves of compartmentalized signaling that are spatially and temporally regulated . In early endosomes , housekeeping receptors are uncoupled from their ligands at the mildly acidic ( pH 6 . 2 ) pH [ 8 ] and recycled back to the plasma membrane directly or indirectly via recycling endosome , while other molecules are routed toward the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) [ 9 , 10 ] . By contrast , signaling receptors that need to be downregulated , including activated epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , are sorted by endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) com - plexes and their accessory proteins , into membrane inva - ginations that form toward the early endosome lumen [ 7 , 11 – 13 ] — ESCRT and the accessory protein ALG - 2 interacting protein X ( Alix ) are also involved in the release of a number of viruses , including HIV - 1 , at the plasma membrane and during abscission in cytokinesis [ 14 – 16 ] . Membrane invagination within early endosomes leads to the formation of a multivesicular endosome or ECV / MVB ( endosomal carrier vesicle / multivesicular body ; Figure 1 ) . In turn , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) itself may stimulate both ECV / MVB biogenesis and inward vesiculation [ 17 ] . Once formed , ECV / MVBs detach — or mature — from early endosomes , rapidly acidify to pH (cid:2) 5 . 5 and undergo microtubule - dependent transport toward late endosomes . These function as the last sorting station in the endocytic pathway from where protein and lipid , rather than being delivered to lyso - somes for degradation , can be retrieved and transported to other cellular destinations [ 18 ] , including the TGN [ 19 – 21 ] and the plasma membrane at least in some cell types [ 22 , 23 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . Finally , late endosomes and lysosomes are also connected to the autophagy pathway [ 24 ] . Virus entry Different types of viruses have evolved different , some - times elaborate , strategies to adsorb onto , penetrate and infect mammalian cells , so that they can deliver their genomes for infection to proceed [ 25 , 26 ] . In addition , a given virus may exploit multiple cell surface receptors and cellular functions , including the triggering of sig - naling cascades to elicit its own penetration [ 26 , 27 ] . Some viruses may also enter cells by more than one route . For example , enveloped viruses such as HIV and many other retroviruses undergo fusion with the plasma membrane but are also endocytosed and thus can potentially infect cells from the cell surface and from endosomes . Another Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2009 , 21 : 582 – 588 www . sciencedirect . com enveloped virus , inﬂuenza virus , not only enters cells primarily by clathrin - mediated endocytosis , but also uses a clathrin - independent pathway [ 28 ] in a process regulated by Epsin 1 [ 29 ] . In addition , Simian vacuolating virus 40 ( SV40 ) not only is internalized via caveolae [ 30 ] but can also use another pathway [ 31 ] perhaps CLICs / GEECs [ 1 ] . The capsid of SV40 , which is a nonenveloped DNA virus , is composed of VP1 homopentamers that resemble cho - lera toxin B pentamers and , like the cholera toxin B subunit , SV40 binds gangliosides on the cell surface and enters via a raft / caveolar pathway [ 1 , 26 , 32 ] . It has been shown that the homopentameric B - subunit of Shiga toxin , upon binding to the ceramide Gb 3 on the cell surface , is capable of forming membrane invaginations that trigger the ﬁrst step of its own uptake into cells [ 33 ] . This might suggest that pentameric clustering of receptor lipids facilitates membrane deformation , presumably by triggering asymmetry , phase separation , and the for - mation of protein – lipid nanodomains [ 34 ] . Both cholera and Shiga toxins are eventually transported to the endo - plamic reticulum , like SV40 but not via the same pathway [ 10 , 26 , 27 ] , raising the possibility that such protein – lipid clusters serve as molecular ﬂags of retrograde transport . Like other viruses including murine leukemia virus , HIV - 1 , vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) [ 35 ] , and human papil - lomavirus type 16 [ 36 ] , vaccinia virus , a large and envel - oped DNA virus , is recruited onto cell surface ﬁlopodia , where it then surfs on the plasma membrane toward the cell body in an actin - dependent manner [ 37 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . On reach - ing the cell body the virus triggers the formation of transient membrane blebs and eventually enters cells by macropinocytosis in a process that requires p21 - acti - vated kinase 1 ( Pak1 ) and CtBP1 / BARS [ 37 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] , which mediates membrane ﬁssion in dynamin - independent transport pathways [ 38 ] . CtBP1 / BARS and Pak1 are also necessary for the uptake of echovirus 1 [ 39 , 40 (cid:3) ] and adenovirus serotype 3 [ 41 (cid:3) ] by macropinocytosis . Inter - estingly , vaccinia has phosphatidylserine ( PS ) exposed on its surface [ 37 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . PS is normally present on the cyto - plasmic leaﬂet of the plasma membrane , where it regulates surface charge and protein localization [ 42 , 43 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] , and this distribution depends on the P - type ATPase homolog TAT - 1 in C . elegans [ 44 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . While the Viruses in endosomes Gruenberg 583 Figure 1 ( a ) Once endocytosed , VSV particles reach mildly acidic early endosomes ( pH (cid:2) 6 . 2 ) and are packaged within forming ECV / MVBs , which then detach — or mature — from early endosomes and acidify to pH (cid:2) 5 . 0 . VSV envelope undergoes fusion with ECV / MVB lumenal membranes , thereby releasing the viral capsid into the vesicle lumen , where it remains hidden . In late endosomes , back - fusion with the limiting membrane ensures capsid delivery to the cytoplasm . ( b ) After PI 3 - kinase inhibition or knockdown of Hrs or SNX3 , ‘empty’ ECV / MVBs are formed , which lack intralumenal vesicles . Virions fuse with the limiting membrane of these empty endosomes , there being no internal membranes to fuse with , thereby by - passing the need to reach late endosomes .

This suggests that the virus enters cells in the disguise of an apoptotic body — perhaps to avoid immune detection [ 37 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . The presence of anionic phospholipids on the surface of infected cells and virions may provide a new target for the generation of antiviral agents [ 45 ] . Virus trafﬁcking along the endocytic pathway The majority of viruses use endocytic pathways to pene - trate cells , presumably because they make use of the transport machinery to hitchhike their way into the cell and , by doing so , also overcome the barriers of the cortical cytoskeleton and hide away from the host immune system [ 26 ] . For example , low pH - induced fusion of VSV pre - bound to the plasma membrane leads to an artiﬁcial infection that is about one order of magnitude less efﬁ - cient than infection through endosomes , suggesting that VSV uses endosomes to reach the perinuclear region more efﬁciently [ 46 ] . Evidence shows that some viruses are delivered to and transported within specialized endosome subpopulations . However , it is not always clear to what extent viruses may change the properties and characteristics of the compart - ments through which they travel , or hijack an existing mechanism . For example , echovirus 1 may elicit its own internalization pathway from endosomes to caveosomes , perhaps via clustering of its receptor a 2 b 1 integrin [ 39 ] , while lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus seems to use a novel endocytic pathway for infectious entry into cells via late endosomes [ 47 ] . Similarly , it has also been proposed that inﬂuenza virus is preferentially sorted into a dynamic population of early endosomes , which acquire the small GTPase Rab7 while still containing Rab5 [ 48 ] . These may represent specialized early endosomes or endosomal membrane domains , perhaps corresponding to the endo - somes that contain internalized Semliki forest virus ( SFV ) and recruit Rab7 [ 49 ] , or to maturing endosomes under - going Rab5 – Rab7 conversion [ 50 ] . It is not clear whether these endosomes that transiently contain both Rab5 and Rab7 are obligatory intermediates along the endocytic pathway , but the sequential action of Rab5 and Rab7 also regulates the recruitment of the retromer complex that mediates endosome - to - TGN transport [ 21 ] . By contrast , both the human adenovirus types 2 and 5 ( Ad2 / 5 ) and the escape - defective temperature - sensitive Ad2 - ts1 mutant are endocytosed into the same common early endosome , from where Ad2 / 5 escapes into the cytosol while , unlike SFV , the ts mutant is transported toward late endosomes in a Rab7 - independent manner [ 51 ] . Once in endosomes , enveloped viruses deliver their nucleic acid to the cytoplasm via fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes [ 52 ] , but they have evolved partially different strategies to achieve this goal . SFV already undergoes fusion at the mildly acidic pH of early endosomes ( pH (cid:2) 6 . 2 ) in a process triggered by the E1 viral glycoprotein , leading to release of the capsid into the cytosol [ 26 ] . Concomitantly , viral proteins together with unfused viruses become sequestered in early endo - some membrane domains that recruit Rab7 , and are then transported toward late endosomes and lysosomes to be degraded [ 49 ] . SFV , however , causes the formation of cytopathic vacuoles containing small vesicular invagina - tions , which are derived from late endocytic compart - ments and are believed to represent sites of viral RNA synthesis [ 53 ] — other ( + ) RNA viruses also modify intra - cellular membranes to support replication of their gen - omes [ 54 (cid:3) ] . It is not clear how SFV fusion in early endosomes and capsid release is coupled to the alterations of late endosomal membranes and RNA replication . The inﬂuenza virus receptor is sialic acid present on glycoproteins or glycolipids [ 52 ] , and the binding site is a shallow pocket exposed on the surface of the HA1 viral glycoprotein [ 55 ] . Surprisingly , infection with inﬂuenza virus is sensitive to proteasome inhibitors and inhibited by a Vps4 dominant - negative mutant [ 56 ] . These con - ditions inhibit ESCRT - mediated sorting of ubiquitinated signaling receptors into the intralumenal vesicles of mul - tivesicular endosomes [ 13 , 57 ] , perhaps suggesting that virions might be sorted into multivesicular endosomes upon ubiquitination of a putative receptor [ 56 ] . Next , dynamic endosomes containing inﬂuenza virus particles acquire Rab7 [ 48 ] and are transported toward the peri - nuclear region where they are acidiﬁed ﬁrst to pH (cid:2) 6 . 0 and then to pH (cid:2) 5 [ 58 ] . Before fusion , acidiﬁcation of the virion via the viral proton channel M2 facilitates unpacking of the viral genome [ 59 , 60 ] , and then fusion is triggered upon acidiﬁcation in late endosomes by a conformational change in the viral glycoprotein HA , leading to nucleic acid release into the cytoplasm [ 58 ] . Vesicular stomatitis virus Unlike inﬂuenza virus , infection with VSV and SFV is insensitive to proteasome inhibitors suggesting that no ubiquitinated viral receptor is involved [ 56 ] . Phosphati - dylserine had been proposed to serve as VSV receptor [ 61 ] but this view has been challenged [ 62 ] . Ligand binding might involve a canyon between the lateral and PH domains visible in the crystal structure of VSV G glyco - protein [ 63 ] . Once endocytosed , VSV fusion is triggered by a low pH - mediated conformational change in the viral glycoprotein G , which , unlike SFV , occurs beyond early endosomes [ 46 , 64 (cid:3) ] . In contrast to inﬂuenza virus , how - ever , VSV fusion occurs in transport intermediates be - tween early and late endosome and not in late endosomes [ 46 , 64 (cid:3) ] ( Figure 1 ) . Typically , microtubule depolymeri - zation , which slows down transport to late endosomes [ 65 ] , inhibits inﬂuenza virus [ 58 ] but not VSV [ 46 ] fusion . Moreover , VSV fusion and capsid release into the cyto - plasm do not appear to be concomitant events . Fusion , 584 Membranes and organelles Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2009 , 21 : 582 – 588 www . sciencedirect . com which already occurs in multivesicular transport inter - mediates between early and late endosomes , might release the nucleocapsid within the lumen of intra - endo - somal vesicles , where it remains hidden [ 46 ] . Transport to late endosomes is then required for the nucleocapsid to be delivered to the cytoplasm . Although without effect on virus fusion , microtubule depolymerization reduces viral RNA release into the cytoplasm [ 46 ] . How endocytosed VSV reaches intralumenal vesicles is not clear . However , VSV may well stochastically bind to and fuse with intralumenal membranes under physiologi - cal conditions of infection , when cells contain only few virions , simply because intralumenal membranes are more abundant than the limiting membrane . This is consistent with the notion that VSV is not sorted via a putative ubiquitinated receptor [ 56 ] — if inﬂuenza virus were sorted into multivesicular endosomes [ 56 ] , it would presumably also fuse with intralumenal vesicles , but in late endosomes [ 48 , 58 ] . Further evidence for the fusion of VSV envelope with the membrane of intralumenal vesicles comes from observations that VSV RNA delivery to the cytosol bypasses the need for transport to late endosomes , when multivesicular endosomes are ‘empty’ or devoid of lumenal membranes , for example after inhibition of PI 3 - kinase [ 46 , 66 – 68 ] or knockdown of hepatocyte growth factor - regulated tyrosine kinase sub - strate ( Hrs ) [ 46 , 69 , 70 ] or sorting nexin 3 ( SNX3 ) [ 71 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] ( Figure 1 ) . Then , virions presumably undergo fusion with the limiting membrane of ‘empty’ multivesicular endo - somes , having no internal membranes to interact with , leading to concomitant virus fusion and RNA delivery to the cytoplasm [ 46 , 71 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . In fact , multivesicular endosome biogenesis on early endosomes may depend on two mechanisms that deform the membrane simultaneously in opposite directions , eventually leading to the formation of a large ( (cid:2) 0 . 45 m m diameter [ 65 ] ) endosomal vacuole that concomitantly accumulates vesicles in its lumen . The phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) - binding protein SNX3 may control the formation of intralumenal membranes [ 71 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] , perhaps together with ESCRT com - ponents , in particular ESCRT - III [ 72 , 73 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 74 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . In addition , an actin - based mechanism involving annexin A2 , Spire - 1 , and Arp2 / 3 may be responsible for membrane deformation in the opposite direction , leading to the formation of the nascent multivesicular endosomes [ 75 , 76 , 77 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . Once intralumenal vesicles containing their viral RNA cargo are delivered to late endosomes , back - fusion of these vesicles with the late endosome limiting membrane presumably releases the viral capsid into the cytosol [ 46 , 64 (cid:3) ] . This process depends on lysobispho - sphatidic acid ( LBPA ) , an unconventional phospholipid only detected in late endosomes and abundant in intra - lumenal membranes [ 78 ] , and its putative effector Alix / AIP1 [ 64 (cid:3) , 79 ] , which functions as an ESCRT accessory protein [ 12 , 57 , 80 ] . Moreover , the tumor susceptibility gene 101 ( Tsg101 ) subunit of the ESCRT - I complex , which mediates receptor sorting into multivesicular endosomes [ 12 , 57 ] , is dispensable for viral envelope fusion with endosomal membranes and viral RNA trans - port to late endosomes , but is necessary for infection and RNA release [ 64 (cid:3) ] . These data indicate that Tsg101 , in addition to its role in receptor sorting into multivesicular endosomes , may well play a direct role in the release of nucleocapsids from within multivesicular endosomes to the cytoplasm by controlling the back - fusion process . Conclusions The molecular mechanism by which the cytosolic factors Alix and Tsg101 control back - fusion events that occur on the opposite side of endosomal membrane , within a space topologically equivalent to the extracellular medium , remains to be elucidated . However , back - fusion appears to be mechanistically coupled with the invagination pro - cess that leads to intralumenal vesicle formation within late endosomes . Indeed , LBPA , Alix , and Tsg101 also play a direct role in the membrane invagination process [ 79 , 81 ] , perhaps together with ESCRT - III [ 72 , 73 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 74 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . One may speculate that Alix interacts with LBPA as the lipid appears on the limiting membrane during back - fusion , and , by trapping this postfusion — or preﬁs - sion — intermediate , Alix and its partner Tsg101 may control subsequent rounds of ﬁssion and fusion . Hence , Tsg101 in concert with Alix may contribute to the regu - lation of ﬁssion and thereby control lumenal vesicle fusion events . The delivery of the anthrax toxin lethal factor to the cytoplasm follows the same intra - endosomal pathway , and also depends on both LBPA and Alix / AIP1 [ 82 ] . Moreover , Alix and LBPA also control the export of LDL - derived cholesterol from late endosomes [ 83 , 84 ] , suggesting that this process , much like capsid release , depends on the back - fusion of lumenal vesicles with the limiting membrane , as does perhaps the export of cellular proteins , which present within intralumenal membranes when in transit through endosomes [ 18 ] . Recent studies are providing new insights into the mech - anisms used by viruses to infect cells . Moreover , high - throughput screens are now revealing the protein require - ment during infection with various viruses , including SV40 and SFV [ 85 ] , HIV - 1 [ 86 ] , West Nile virus [ 87 ] , and Hepatitis C [ 88 ] . Such efforts are providing funda - mental information on the mechanisms of infection for each virus and on common principles that may be shared by more than one virus — information that is expected to lead to new antiviral strategies . Conversely , the progress made in studying the routes of viral entry to cells , whether in high - throughput screens or cell and molecular bio - chemistry experiments , is contributing to our understand - ing of some of the basic mechanisms that control endocytic membrane dynamics .
