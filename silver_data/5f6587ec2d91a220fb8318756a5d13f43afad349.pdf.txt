To produce red pigments , birds ingest yellow carotenoids and endogenously convert them into red ketocarotenoids via an oxidation reac - tion catalyzed by a previously unknown ketolase [ 4 – 6 ] . We investigated the genetic basis for red color - ation in birds using whole - genome sequencing of red siskins ( Spinus cucullata ) , common canaries ( Serinus canaria ) , and ‘‘red factor’’ canaries , which are the hybrid product of crossing red siskins with common canaries [ 7 ] . We identiﬁed two genomic regions intro - gressed from red siskins into red factor canaries that are required for red coloration . One of these regions contains a gene encoding a cytochrome P450 enzyme , CYP2J19 . Transcriptome analysis demon - strates that CYP2J19 is signiﬁcantly upregulated in the skin and liver of red factor canaries , strongly implicating CYP2J19 as the ketolase that mediates red coloration in birds . Interestingly , a second intro - gressed region required for red feathers resides within the epidermal differentiation complex , a clus - ter of genes involved in development of the integu - ment . Lastly , we present evidence that CYP2J19 is involved in ketocarotenoid formation in the retina . The discovery of the carotenoid ketolase has im - portant implications for understanding sensory function and signaling mediated by carotenoid pigmentation . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To identify the genetic basis of red coloration in birds ( Figure 1 ) , we took advantage of the unique genetic history of ‘‘red factor’’ canaries . Starting in the 1920s , bird fanciers crossed yellow common canaries with the red siskin , a South American bird with red ketocarotenoid - pigmented feathers [ 7 ] . Hybrid offspring were then backcrossed with common canaries over multiple generations to create the world’s ﬁrst red factor canary ( Fig - ure 2A ) . Given this genetic history , we reasoned that the genome of red factor canaries would contain regions responsible for red coloration introgressed from red siskins onto a background of common canary DNA . To identify these introgressed regions , we performed whole - genome sequencing of pooled DNA sam - ples from red factor canaries , common canaries ( both domestic and wild ) , and red siskins ( Table S1 ) . We generated a total of (cid:1) 1 . 5 billion sequence reads that were mapped to the canary reference genome , resulting in an average effective coverage of 19 . 3 3 per pool ( Table S1 ) . To detect signatures of genetic differentiation between red factor and common canaries , we measured the ﬁxation index ( F ST ) , a metric for summarizing allele frequency differences between populations [ 12 ] . We averaged F ST values across the genome using a sliding - window approach and found that the average level of genetic differentiation was low ( F ST = 0 . 079 ) ( Figure 2B ) , permitting us to detect regions of heightened differ - entiation indicative of positive selection . The strongest signals of selection in our sliding - window analysis were restricted to two genomic regions ( Figure 2B ) : one located on scaffold NW _ 007931131 , homologous to zebra ﬁnch chromosome 8 ( (cid:1) 24 , 000 , 000 – 25 , 600 , 000 bp ) , and the other located on scaf - fold NW _ 007931203 , homologous to zebra ﬁnch chromosome 25 ( (cid:1) 700 , 000 – 900 , 000 bp ) . All windows above the 99 . 9 th percentile of the empirical distribution ( F ST R 0 . 45 ) map to these two regions . Next , we searched for consistent differences in allele fre - quencies of individual SNPs between two distinct breeds of red factor canaries and ﬁve breeds of common canaries . Using a Cochran - Mantel - Haenszel ( CMH ) test [ 13 ] , we evaluated 9 , 414 , 439 SNPs and found that 15 , 681 SNPs ( 0 . 17 % ) were signiﬁcantly associated with red coloration after Bonferroni correction . Importantly , 10 , 216 of the signiﬁcant SNPs ( 65 . 1 % ) and all of the top 100 SNPs ( p % 2 . 43 3 10 (cid:3) 18 ) localized to the same two genomic regions revealed by the F ST analysis ( Figure 2C ) . Current Biology 26 , 1427 – 1434 , June 6 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Ltd . 1427 To locate genomic segments of red siskin origin across the red factor canary genome , we used summary statistics that enabled us to quantify levels of introgression . We started by comparing the genomes of non - red canaries to that of the red siskin . We found that the two species are well differenti - ated ( average nucleotide divergence = 1 . 77 % ) and the ge - nomes are well sorted , with 99 . 4 % of all the possible 20 kb windows in the genome displaying at least one diagnostic mutation . This sharp differentiation means that introgressed segments in the red factor genome should be unambiguously identiﬁable . We then computed a statistic ( f ^ d ) that measures the fraction of the genome shared through introgression [ 14 ] . This statistic varies between 0 ( no introgression ) and 1 ( complete replace - ment ) . When averaged across the entire genome , f ^ d was close to 0 ( f ^ d = 0 . 006 ) , suggesting that the overall genetic contribution of red siskin to the red factor canary genome is small , which is consistent with historical records indicating that many gener - ations of backcrossing canary - siskin hybrids to common ca - naries were necessary to both ﬁx the red trait and improve hybrid fertility [ 7 ] . However , the sliding - window analysis identi - ﬁed several segments of the genome with elevated f ^ d values ( Figure 2D ) , indicative of introgression of red siskin haplotypes in speciﬁc genomic regions . The two strongest signals of intro - gression overlapped the same two top regions in the F ST analysis and CMH test ( NW _ 007931131 and NW _ 007931203 ) . A third outlier region emerged from this analysis located on scaffold NW _ 007931145 , which is homologous to zebra ﬁnch chromo - some 3 ( (cid:1) 24 , 100 , 000 – 26 , 950 , 000 bp ) . The relative node depth statistic ( RND ) was also calculated between red factor and non - red canaries . RND is a measure of genetic divergence that controls for mutation rate variation , thus allowing us to distinguish between low mutation rate and introgression as the cause of sequence similarity [ 15 ] . This analysis pinpointed the same outlier regions , corroborating the previous ﬁndings from the f ^ d statistic ( Figure 2E ) . Overall , the substantial overlap between differentiation and introgres - sion statistics indicates that the outlier regions identiﬁed here are strong candidates for the genomic regions mediating red coloration in canaries . Furthermore , the fact that at least two genomic regions are implicated in red coloration in ca - naries ( see below ) is consistent with the genetic architecture of this trait , which is known to be governed by more than one locus [ 16 ] .

Hill ( D – H ) . 1428 Current Biology 26 , 1427 – 1434 , June 6 , 2016 To conduct ﬁne - mapping of these outlier regions , we identiﬁed a set of variants that unambiguously distinguish the red siskin and non - red - canary genomes . We then genotyped these vari - ants in a larger cohort of birds representing a broader range of breeds . For the regions homologous to zebra ﬁnch chromo - somes 8 ( NW _ 007931131 ) and 25 ( NW _ 007931203 ) , we were able to substantially reduce the size of the candidate intervals ( Figure 3 ) . For NW _ 007931131 , all red birds ( n = 49 ) carried at least one haplotype of siskin origin over a 631 kb segment ( posi - tions 23 , 728 , 812 – 24 , 359 , 539 bp ) . For NW _ 007931203 , all red birds were homozygous for the red siskin haplotype encompass - ing 34 kb ( positions 169 , 696 – 203 , 507 bp ) . In the region homolo - gous to zebra ﬁnch chromosome 3 ( scaffold NW _ 007931145 ) , many red birds did not carry any haplotype of red siskin origin , making it unlikely that any gene in this region is strictly neces - sary for red coloration ( Figure S1 ) . Together with the whole - genome sequencing results ( Figure 2 ) , these data indicate that NW _ 007931145 contains haplotypes that were introgressed from red siskin but that are segregating at moderate frequencies in red factor canaries ( Figure 2B ) . Two additional observations from these genotyping results and from animals generated by crossing yellow and red factor canaries provide information about the genetic architecture of red coloration . First , we identiﬁed a bird displaying yellow plumage that was heterozygous for the NW _ 007931131 re - gion but homozygous for the common canary allele in the NW _ 007931203 region . Second , individuals that are hetero - zygous for both candidate regions do not express red , but rather a yellow / orange coloration . We can thus conclude that both regions are necessary to produce red coloration . The NW _ 007931131 region appears to act in a dominant fashion such that a single copy of the red siskin allele is sufﬁcient , whereas homozygosity for the siskin allele in the NW _ 007931203 region is necessary to express red feather coloration . We next investigated the gene content of the two introgressed regions that are necessary for red coloration . Using the pub - lished annotation of the canary reference genome , together with an in - depth annotation analysis derived from de novo tran - scriptome assemblies obtained separately for red and yellow canaries , we identiﬁed ﬁve genes within the interval on scaffold NW _ 007931131 : FGGY , HOOK1 , CYP2J19 , CYP2J40 , and NFIA . Within the interval on scaffold NW _ 007931203 , we identi - ﬁed six genes— EDMY1 , EDbeta , EDMTFH , EDMTF4 , EDMPN - L , and EDMTF2 —plus the promoter region of one gene ( LOR1 ) ( detailed in Table S2 ) . The latter interval maps to the epidermal differentiation complex ( EDC ) , an extended block of genes involved in integumentary development [ 18 ] . We also utilized whole - genome sequencing data to detect structural vari - ants ( i . e . , deletions , duplications , inversions , or translocations ) that differ between the common canary and red siskin haplo - types ( Table S3 ) . We identiﬁed several candidate variants , but none overlapped annotated genes , suggesting that the gene content and synteny of both regions is likely to be preserved between the two divergent haplotypes . However , without high - quality genome assemblies for both species , we cannot absolutely exclude the existence of some minor structural differences . The skin and liver are the two most important anatomical sites for conversion of yellow dietary carotenoids into red ketocarotenoids for plumage coloration in birds [ 19 ] .

We observed nine genes in the skin and 102 genes in the liver that were differentially expressed ( false discovery rate [ FDR ] = 0 . 1 % ) ( Figure 4A ) . Within the two candi - date regions associated with red coloration , we detected signif - icant differential expression of three genes in liver and / or skin : CYP2J19 , FGGY , and EDMTFH ( Figure 4A ) . To corroborate the RNA - seq results , we conducted qPCR .

See also Figure S1 . 1430 Current Biology 26 , 1427 – 1434 , June 6 , 2016 whereas FGGY had 2 - to 3 - fold lower expression in red birds compared to yellow ( Figure 4B ) . In contrast , we found no detect - able expression of EDMTFH in liver and slightly higher levels in the skin of red birds compared to yellow birds ( Figure 4B ) . This latter result conﬂicts with the results from RNA - seq , which showed EDMTFH to be downregulated in red skin . Upon reexamination of the RNA - seq data , we discovered that the apparent differential expression observed for EDMTFH was due to a read - mapping artifact , in which red - siskin - derived EDMTFH reads mapped less efﬁciently to the common canary transcriptome assembly . Thus , we conclude that CYP2J19 expression is markedly elevated in the skin and liver of red birds relative to yellow birds , but that FGGY and EDMTFH levels are only moderately different between the two . To further characterize these expression differences , we crossed red factor canaries to common canaries and measured allele - speciﬁc expression in the offspring . Strikingly , we found that 100 % of CYP2J19 transcripts were derived from the red allele in both skin and liver in all three offspring examined ( Fig - ure 4C ) . Additionally , we found preferential expression of the yellow allele of FGGY in both skin ( (cid:1) 83 % of normalized reads deriving from the yellow allele ) and liver ( (cid:1) 64 % of normalized reads deriving from the yellow allele ) . In contrast , we found similar levels of expression of yellow and red alleles of EDMTFH in skin and liver ( although EDMTFH was undetectable in liver by qPCR , it was possible to amplify trace amounts of the transcript by PCR for allelic analysis ) . Thus , the most notable ﬁnding from these studies was the occurrence of extreme allelic imbalance favoring expression of the red - siskin - derived allele of CYP2J19 in both skin and liver . Unlike EDMTFH , which encodes a structural protein with no known enzymatic function [ 18 ] , both FGGY and CYP2J19 are predicted to encode enzymes and therefore have the potential to mediate the formation of red ketocarotenoids from yellow precursors . Because skin and liver are the two most likely sites of feather ketocarotenoid production in birds [ 19 ] , a carotenoid ketolase should be upregulated in red bird skin and / or liver relative to yellow birds . Expression of FGGY is signiﬁcantly lower in the red factor canary than in the yellow canary , the opposite of what one would expect for a ketolase . Furthermore , FGGY encodesaproteinwithhomologytoafamilyofkinasesthatphos - phorylate carbohydrate substrates [ 20 ] , a function seemingly Figure 4 .

Although we cannot exclude a role for FGGY in the production of red feathers , these considerations indicate that it is not an ideal candidate for the ketolase . CYP2J19 , in contrast , is markedly elevated in the red factor canary and is a member of a large superfamily of cytochrome P450 oxygenases that act on a range of small - molecule sub - strates , including carotenoids [ 21 – 23 ] . Members of this family are known to mediate ketolation in the 4 position of the b - ion - one ring of retinoids in mammals [ 24 ] . Furthermore , a cyto - chrome P450 family member , crtR , is required for astaxanthin production from b - carotene in the yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous [ 25 ] . If skin is a site of ketocarotenoid production in red canaries and CYP2J19 encodes the carotenoid ketolase , then we expect higherlevelof CYP2J19 expressionintheregeneratingfeatherfol - licles of red birds compared to yellow birds . To investigate this possibility , we analyzed the expression of CYP2J19 in skin by in situ hybridization . We found strong expression of CYP2J19 in the regenerating feather follicle of red factor canaries , whereas transcripts were present at much lower levels in the skin of yellow birds ( Figure 4D ) . The pattern of CYP2J19 expression correlates precisely with the distribution of ketocarotenoids in the regener - ating feather ( Figure 4D ) . For comparison , we also analyzed the expression of CYP2J40 and found comparable levels in the regenerating feather follicles of red and yellow birds ( Figure 4D ) . Overall , these ﬁndings make CYP2J19 a strong candidate for the avian carotenoid ketolase . Because ketocarotenoids are also present in the avian retina , we investigated whether CYP2J19 might be expressed in this tissue in a pattern consistent with a role in carotenoid ketolation . The red single cone in the avian retina utilizes a ke - tocarotenoid , astaxanthin , as an intracellular spectral ﬁlter to enhance color discrimination [ 26 – 28 ] . Astaxanthin is thought to be synthesized locally within the red cone from a yellow dietary precursor , zeaxanthin ( Figures 1 and S2A ) . We found that CYP2J19 transcript levels in the chicken retina correlate well with the levels of astaxanthin over development ( Figures S2B , S2D , and S2E ) . Furthermore , in situ hybridization indi - cates that CYP2J19 expression is restricted to a subset of cells in the outer nuclear layer , consistent with expression in red single cones ( Figure S2C ) . This correlation is compatible with the hypothesis that CYP2J19 mediates production of astaxan - thin in the developing red cone . Interestingly , yellow canaries have levels of CYP2J19 expres - sion in the retina similar to those found in the retinas of red birds ( Figure S3 ) . This ﬁnding suggests that the expression differences observed between yellow and red birds in the skin and liver are due to cis - regulatory differences between the two CYP2J19 alleles . The vast majority of bird species possess ketocarotenoid - based oil droplets in their retinas and thus presumably express CYP2J19 in this tissue . However , only a subset of bird species deposit these red pigments in their skin and feathers . Thus , we hypothesize that nearly all bird species have the latent capacity to produce ketocarotenoid - based red feather coloration , but that cis - regulatory changes at the CYP2J19 locus are required for the gain of expression in the skin and / or liver that leads to the emergence of this trait in selected species . Homozygosity for red siskin alleles in the EDC region is also necessary for red feather production in canaries . If CYP2J19 en - codes the ketolase , then what is the function of the EDC region ? We did not identify major differences in gene expression within the EDC region between red and yellow birds , suggesting that coding variants might be involved . To address this point , we scanned all six candidate genes in the EDC region for coding variants . We identiﬁed 11 nonsynonymous variants in three genes ( EDMTFH [ 12 ] , EDMPN - L [ 1 ] , and EDMTF2 [ 2 ] ) ( Table S5 ) . In addition , we evaluated the ﬁve candidate genes in the CYP2J19 region for coding variants and found another 24 nonsy - nonymous mutations in three genes ( HOOK1 [ 7 ] , CYP2J40 [ 7 ] , and CYP2J19 [ 14 ] ) . We did not identify frameshift or STOP loss / gain mutations in any of the genes . Based on sequence conservation , we predict that several amino acid changes for which the derived state is present in red canaries might alter protein function ( Table S5 ) , but functional assays will be required to determine what role , if any , these coding variants play in red feather coloration . The enzyme that converts yellow carotenoids into red keto - carotenoids in birds has long been sought [ 5 , 7 , 29 , 30 ] . Here , we present CYP2J19 as a strong candidate for the carot - enoid ketolase . Genetic and expression analysis in canary and chicken support CYP2J19 as the ketolase , or a component thereof . In a co - submitted paper , CYP2J19 was also identiﬁed as the gene responsible for red coloration in the bill and legs of zebra ﬁnches [ 31 ] , suggesting that it serves as the ketolase in multiple tissues across diverse groups of birds . Carotenoid coloration is widely accepted as a condition - dependent signal of individual quality that is assessed in mate choice and other social interactions [ 32 , 33 ] . The discovery of the ketolase gene in birds presents unprecedented opportunities for investi - gating the signal content of carotenoid coloration [ 34 ] . The oxidation potential required by P450 enzymes suggests that production of red pigments via CYP2J19 will be sensitive to the organism - wide oxidative state , potentially explaining why red carotenoid coloration is so consistently linked to individual quality [ 35 , 36 ] .
