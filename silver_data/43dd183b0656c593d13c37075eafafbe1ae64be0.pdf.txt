ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTION Persistence of Contradicted Claims in the Literature Athina Tatsioni , MD Nikolaos G . Bonitsis , MD John P . A . Ioannidis , MD S OME RESEARCH FINDINGS THAT have received wide attention in the scientific community , as proven by the high citation counts of the respective articles , are eventually contradicted by subsequent evidence . 1 A number of such high - profile contradictions pertain to differ - ences between nonrandomized and ran - domized studies . For example , the effect of vitamin E on cardiovascular disease prevention has been in the center of a majordebateinclinicalresearchoverthelast2decades . Vitamin E is known to have antioxidant activity , and a long list of citations in the preclinical literature on antioxidants 2 - 4 suggested that these agents may be beneficial for cancer and cardiovascular disease . Two highly cited publications suggested in the 1990s that vitamin E could decrease cardiovascu - lardiseaseriskbyalmosthalfinmenandinwomen . 5 , 6 However , subsequent ran - domizedtrialsshowednobenefitorevensuggestedincreasedharm . 7 , 8 Several other highly prominent contradictions havealsobeenrecordedpertainingtotheeffectsofotherdietarycomponentsandhormones . 9 - 15 The prominent refuta - tion of the epidemiological studies has spurredconsiderablecontroversyforob - servational epidemiology in gen - eral . 16 - 21 Such debate offers opportunities to study what happens to the scientific lit - erature , when a highly prominent claim is refuted .

Context Some research findings based on observational epidemiology are contra - dicted by randomized trials , but may nevertheless still be supported in some scientific circles . Objectives To evaluate the change over time in the content of citations for 2 highly cited epidemiological studies that proposed major cardiovascular benefits associated with vitamin E in 1993 ; and to understand how these benefits continued being defended in the literature , despite strong contradicting evidence from large randomized clinical trials ( RCTs ) . To examine the generalizability of these findings , we also examined the extent of persistence of supporting citations for the highly cited and contradicted protective ef - fects of beta - carotene on cancer and of estrogen on Alzheimer disease . Data Sources For vitamin E , we sampled articles published in 1997 , 2001 , and 2005 ( before , early , and late after publication of refuting evidence ) that referenced the highly cited epidemiological studies and separately sampled articles published in 2005 and referencing the major contradicting RCT ( HOPE trial ) . We also sampled articles pub - lished in 2006 that referenced highly cited articles proposing benefits associated with beta - carotene for cancer ( published in 1981 and contradicted long ago by RCTs in 1994 - 1996 ) and estrogen for Alzheimer disease ( published in 1996 and contradicted recently by RCTs in 2004 ) . Data Extraction The stance of the citing articles was rated as favorable , equivocal , and unfavorable to the intervention . We also recorded the range of counterargu - ments raised to defend effectiveness against contradicting evidence . Results For the 2 vitamin E epidemiological studies , even in 2005 , 50 % of citing ar - ticles remained favorable . A favorable stance was independently less likely in more re - cent articles , specifically in articles that also cited the HOPE trial ( odds ratio for 2001 , 0 . 05 [ 95 % confidence interval , 0 . 01 - 0 . 19 ; P (cid:1) . 001 ] and the odds ratio for 2005 , 0 . 06 [ 95 % confidence interval , 0 . 02 - 0 . 24 ; P (cid:1) . 001 ] , as compared with 1997 ) , and in general / internalmedicinevsspecialtyjournals . AmongarticlescitingtheHOPEtrialin2005 , 41 . 4 % were unfavorable . In 2006 , 62 . 5 % of articles referencing the highly cited article that had proposed beta - carotene and 61 . 7 % of those referencing the highly cited article on es - trogen effectiveness were still favorable ; 100 % and 96 % , respectively , of the citations appeared in specialty journals ; and citations were significantly less favorable ( P = . 001 and P = . 009 , respectively ) when the major contradicting trials were also mentioned . Coun - terarguments defending vitamin E or estrogen included diverse selection and informa - tion biases and genuine differences across studies in participants , interventions , cointer - ventions , and outcomes . Favorable citations to beta - carotene , long after evidence contradicted its effectiveness , did not consider the contradicting evidence . Conclusion Claims from highly cited observational studies persist and continue to be supported in the medical literature despite strong contradictory evidence from ran - domized trials .

To answer these ques - tions , we performed citation content analysis for the 2 most highly cited ar - ticles that proposed vitamin E benefits . We evaluated the change in favorable vs unfavorable citations over time and re - corded the counterarguments that were usedtocontinuesupportingthebeliefinvitaminEeffectiveness . To assess the generalizability of our findings , we also examined the extent to which 2 other major contradicted claims , the preven - tiveeffectivenessofbeta - caroteneforcan - cer and estrogens for Alzheimer demen - tia , continue to be supported in the current literature . METHODS Evolution of Evidence for Vitamin E We focused on 2 highly cited articles published in 1993 . These articles pre - sented data from 2 observational co - horts 5 , 6 and showed consistently that vi - tamin E was associated with major decreases in the relative risk ( RR ) of car - diovascular events ( 0 . 63 , 95 % confi - dence interval [ CI ] , 0 . 47 - 0 . 84 in men and RR , 0 . 59 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 38 - 0 . 91 in women for those receiving vitamin E for 2 years vs none ) . These 2 articles are the most - cited papers on benefits from vitamin E supplementation and they have received 1395 and 1234 ci - tations , respectively , until the end of 2006 . Based on these articles , vitamin E was considered cardioprotective for many years . Several smaller studies sug - gested direct or indirect evidence sup - porting this claim . A randomized trial of 2002 patients ( CHAOS ) published in 1996 also found a 47 % relative risk reduction for cardiovascular events . 7 However , many randomized trials subsequently found no cardiovascular benefit . The most - cited contradicting trial ( HOPE ) was published in January 2000 and found an RR of 1 . 05 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 95 - 1 . 16 ) for cardiovascular events , 8 an effect entirely incompatible with esti - mates of the epidemiological studies . A meta - analysis published in late 2004 concluded that at high doses , vitamin E significantly increased the risk of death ( RR , 1 . 04 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 01 - 1 . 07 ) . 22 Publication of the CHAOS and HOPE trials have also accumu - lated a large number of citations ( 1172 and 704 citations by the end of 2006 , respectively ) and the meta - analysis is also highly cited , despite the short time since its publication ( 226 citations by the end of 2006 , the most - cited article published in in the field of clinical medicine in 2004 according to Essential Science Indica - tors ) . A recent meta - analysis 23 even concluded that among high - quality trials , vitamin E increases mortality regardless of dose ( RR , 1 . 04 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 01 - 1 . 07 in low - bias trials ) . Vitamin E supplementation is not currently recommended by practice guide - lines . 24 , 25 Citation Curves . We downloaded an - nual citation counts from Thomson Sci - entific ISI Web of Knowledge for each of the 2 highly cited epidemiological studies between 1993 and 2006 and also assessed the number articles citing at least 1 of the 2 studies . For reference standard , we examined the total an - nual citation curves for all the articles published in the same year ( 1993 ) and in the same journal as the 2 highly cited epidemiological studies . Selection of the Citing Articles . We sampled citations to the 2 highly cited epidemiological studies at 3 different and equidistant years : 1997 , 2001 , and 2005 . The first selected year ( 1997 ) rep - resents the peak of annual citations and may be perceived to be the time when the evidence was the strongest in fa - vor of vitamin E ( shortly after the ad - ditional support offered by the CHAOS trial published in 1996 ) . 7 The second selected year ( 2001 ) corresponds with an early period after major refutation ( 1 - 2 years after the HOPE results ) . 8 The third selected year ( 2005 ) corre - sponds with a late period after major refutation ; meta - analysis had even shown increased harm with vitamin E . To allow for a fairly similar number of citations analyzed at each selected year , we sampled every third citation in 1997 , every second citation in 2001 , and all citations in 2005 among citations made to either or both highly cited epide - miological articles . Our purpose was not to study the overall literature on a research topic in which contradiction of the original studies has arisen . The boundaries of such a literature review are very diffi - cult , if not impossible , to define . On the contrary , we aimed to examine the citing behavior of the scientific litera - ture toward the original studies that have been contradicted . The content analysis of this set of citations is likely to yield a set of references that is enriched in positions that allude to or even try to defend the original claims . This can give insights on how exten - sively , and with what arguments , these claims are defended despite the ensued contradiction . Characteristics of the Citing Articles . For each eligible citation , we retrieved the full text of the citing ar - ticle . We recorded the first author , jour - nal , and country ( ies ) of investigators . We classified each article depending on whether it had primary data or not ( re - views , meta - analyses , editorials , let - ters , other ) , and articles with primary data were further categorized depend - ing on whether they were derived from a randomized trial or from nonrandom - ized studies . Additionally , we re - trieved the 2005 impact factor for each journal that published an eligible ar - ticle 26 and recorded whether ( per Web of Knowledge classification ) the jour - nal was classified in the general / internal medicine category vs some spe - cialty ( including both clinical and basic sciences ) . We also recorded which of the 2001 and 2005 articles had also cited the HOPE trial , 8 the most highly cited contradicting publication to date on this topic . Citation Content Analysis . We as - sessed how many times each of the 2 highlycitedepidemiologicalstudieswascitedwithareferenceineachcitingar - ticle . For each time that each article was cited , we recorded the exact phrase or sentence in which the reference ( s ) ap - peared and any preceding or follow - ing sentences that elaborated on the same argument ( s ) . When these ar - CONTRADICTED CLAIMS IN THE LITERATURE 2518 JAMA , December 5 , 2007—Vol 298 , No . 21 ( Reprinted ) ©2007 American Medical Association . All rights reserved . Downloaded From : http : / / jama . jamanetwork . com / pdfaccess . ashx ? url = / data / journals / jama / 5251 / on 04 / 10 / 2017 ticles were cited multiple times in the same citing article , we captured the text on all of these appearances . We first excluded citations that were erroneous ( irrelevant , apparently an er - ror of the authors ) , and those that were not pertinent to cardiovascular disease prevention and vitamin E , but instead to some other aspect of the 2 highly cited articles ( eg , associationofvitaminCwith chronic diseases that was also com - mented in the original highly cited ar - ticles ) or some other generic issue ( eg , referringtosimilarmethodsorquestion - naires being used as in the vitamin E studies ) . When the context of the cita - tion was pertinent to the association be - tween vitamin E and cardiovascular dis - ease prevention , we categorized the overall stance of the citing article as fa - vorable , equivocal , or unfavorable . The categorization depended on whether the arguments were suggest - ing that vitamin E had beneficial effects ( favorable ) , both favorable and unfavor - ableargumentsexistedwithoutanyclearpreferencegiventoeither ( equivocal ) , or vitamin E was claimed to be ineffective orharmful ( unfavorable ) . Whenbothfa - vorableandunfavorableargumentswerepresentedbuttheauthorseventuallytooksidesinonedirection , the article was ac - cordingly categorized as either favor - able or unfavorable . For categorization , we cumulatively considered all the ex - poundedargumentsineachcitingarticle . Data extraction was performed by 2 independent investigators ; discrepan - cies were resolved by consensus and ar - bitration by a third investigator . Quantitative Analyses The primary outcome was the propor - tion of articles citing the highly cited epidemiological studies that were fa - vorable , equivocal , and unfavorable about vitamin E effectiveness for car - diovascular disease prevention . The main hypothesis was that these proportions should markedly change between 1997 , 2001 , and 2005 , unless beliefs in vitamin E effectiveness remainedunchanged . Secondaryhypoth - eses evaluated whether any additional characteristicsofthecitingarticlebesides year of publication ( country of origin , article type , impact factor , journal field , articlealsocitedthecontradictingHOPEtrial ) were related to its stance . The primary hypothesis was evalu - ated with the Jonckheere - Terpstra test for multiple - ordered categories . The secondary hypotheses were evaluated with the Kruskal - Wallis analysis of vari - anceforsingle - orderedvariablesandthe Jonckheere - Terpstra test for multiple - ordered variables . We also performed analyses to ex - amine the independent association of different characteristics on the overall stance of a citing article . Unfavorable and equivocal citations were merged be - cause they occurred fewer times than favorable ones . We used univariate lo - gistic regressions to examine the asso - ciation between each of the character - istics mentioned previously with a favorable stance . Variables with a P value of less than . 10 in univariate analyses were considered also in a mul - tivariate analysis . Categorical indepen - dent variables were treated with mul - tiple dummy variables . The regression used step - wise backward elimination of variables that had a P value of greater than . 05 . Forward selection of vari - ables yielded similar models . For the multivariate analyses , we first con - structed a variable that considered both the publication year and whether cita - tion to the HOPE trial was made ( cat - egories : 1997 , 2001 and citing HOPE , 2001 not citing HOPE , 2005 and cit - ing HOPE , and 2005 not citing HOPE ) , since year and citation to the HOPE trial are by default strongly correlated ( cit - ing HOPE not applicable for 1997 ar - ticles ; HOPE was published in 2000 ) . Quantitative analyses were performed using SPSS version 13 . 0 ( SPSS Inc , Chi - cago , Illinois ) and StatXact ( Cytel Corp , Boston , Massachusetts ) . P values were 2 - tailed , and a P value of less than . 05 was considered statistically signifi - cant . Content Analysis for Citations to the HOPE Trial . Articles selected be - cause they cite the 2 highly cited epi - demiological studies may be more likely to be favorable to vitamin E use com - pared with articles that would be se - lected because they cite contradicting studies . Therefore , we also created a separate group of articles in which we sampled every third article that cited in 2005 the HOPE trial , 8 regardless of whether it cited the 2 highly cited epi - demiological studies or not . Through the same process , we identified the pro - portion of favorable , equivocal , and un - favorable citations to vitamin E use . Qualitative Counterarguments . We created a qualitative list of the differ - ent types of arguments that have been made to counter the accumulating evi - dence that vitamin E is harmful or not effective . We categorized counterargu - ments according to allusion to biases and genuine differences in study par - ticipants , interventions , cointerven - tions , and outcomes using the PICO structure . 27 Beta - Carotene for Cancer Prevention and Estrogen for Prevention of Alzheimer Dementia To examine the generalizability of our main findings on vitamin E , we also investigated 2 other examples for which observational claims have been subsequently contradicted by large randomized trials . We used as highly cited articles the most - cited articles that had proposed these claims . We selected a claim that had been made a long time ago and had also been con - tradicted long ago ( beta - carotene for cancer prevention ) , and a claim that had been contradicted very recently ( estrogen for dementia prevention ) . We then examined the current stance ( favorable , equivocal , or unfavorable ) of citing articles . We chose for cita - tion content analysis the calendar year 2006 , ie , a decade and 2 years , respec - tively , after the major contradicting studies were published . Beta - carotene was initially sup - ported by many epidemiological stud - ies and laboratory investigations as a po - tent chemoprevention against cancer . The most - cited article in this litera - ture is an influential review of the epi - demiological and other nonrandom - ized studies that was published in CONTRADICTED CLAIMS IN THE LITERATURE ©2007 American Medical Association .

Randomized trials , nevertheless , found no benefit or harm with beta - carotene use . The 3 most - cited trials on this topic are the Alpha - Tocopherol , Beta Carotene Can - cer Prevention Study Group 10 ( pri - mary outcome , lung cancer ; pub - lished in 1994 ; 1640 citations through 2006 ) , the Beta - Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial 11 ( primary outcome , lung cancer using carotene combined with retinol ; published in 1996 ; 1296 cita - tions through 2006 ) , and the Physi - cians’s Health Study 12 ( primary out - come , all cancers ; published in 1996 ; 1087 citations through 2006 ) . These trials found relative risks of 1 . 18 ( 95 % CI , 1 . 03 - 1 . 36 ) , 1 . 28 ( 95 % CI , 1 . 04 - 1 . 57 ) and 0 . 98 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 91 - 1 . 06 ) , re - spectively . Beta - carotene supplemen - tation is not recommended by any guidelines currently . Estrogens were also supported by many epidemiological studies and labo - ratory investigations as strong neuro - protective agents that could diminish the risk of dementia . The most - cited ar - ticle is an observational study 13 pub - lished in 1996 that found a 60 % ( 95 % CI , 15 - 78 ) RR reduction in postmeno - pausal women taking estrogens . This study has received 915 citations through 2006 . Early randomized trials could not replicate these benefits and in mid - 2004 , the Women’s Health Ini - tiative Memory Study RCT published its results showing a trend for in - creased risk of dementia with estro - gens in postmenopausal women ( RR , 1 . 49 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 83 - 2 . 66 ) 14 and wors - ening of cognition . 15 Estrogens are also not recommended as preventive inter - vention for dementia currently . For each of these 2 topics , we con - structed citation curves for the highly cited epidemiological articles , re - trieved the articles citing the articles in 2006 , evaluated the stance ( favorable , equivocal , or unfavorable ) of the cit - ing articles , and captured counterar - guments raised to defend the effective - ness of these interventions using the same methods as for vitamin E . For 3 articles , the 2 independent reviewers disagreed on the stance of the citation and the third investigator arbitrated on the discrepancy . RESULTS Vitamin E for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Citation Curves Over Time . The cita - tion curve for the 2 vitamin E epide - miological articles largely paralleled the citation curve for all the articles pub - lished in the same journal in 1993 : early Figure 1 .

CONTRADICTED CLAIMS IN THE LITERATURE 2520 JAMA , December 5 , 2007—Vol 298 , No . 21 ( Reprinted ) ©2007 American Medical Association . All rights reserved . Downloaded From : http : / / jama . jamanetwork . com / pdfaccess . ashx ? url = / data / journals / jama / 5251 / on 04 / 10 / 2017 rapid increase , peak in 1997 or 1998 , and slow decline until 2001 ( F IGURE 1 ) . However , in 2002 and beyond , the rela - tive decrease in citations was much steeper for the 2 vitamin E articles than for the total citations to all articles pub - lished in the same journal . The cita - tion rate in 2006 for all articles pub - lished in 1993 continued to be more than half ( 55 % ) of the citation rate in 1997 , while the 2 vitamin E articles had decreased to 20 % of their peak annual citation rate by that time . Characteristics of Eligible Citing Articles . We selected for citation analy - sis 176 citing articles , of which 56 ar - ticles were published in 1997 , 61 in 2001 , and 59 in 2005 ( T ABLE 1 ) . We could not retrieve 2 articles from 2001 and 2 from 2005 ; thus , we finally ana - lyzed 172 publications ( Table 1 ) . Seventy - six articles ( 44 . 2 % ) in - cluded at least 1 author from an insti - tution located in the United States . Ninety - seven ( 56 . 4 % ) articles in - cluded primary data , 23 ( 23 . 7 % ) of which pertained to data from random - ized trials . The citing articles were published in journals with a median impact factor 2 . 310 ( interquartile range , 1 . 52 - 4 . 04 ) . Twenty - six ( 16 . 0 % ) appeared in general or internal medi - cine journals . Seventy - two ( 62 . 1 % ) of the articles in 2001 and 2005 cited also the contradicting HOPE trial ( Table 1 ) . Of the 172 articles , one had entirely erroneously cited 1 of the 2 articles 5 and the citations in another 6 articles were not pertinent to vitamin E and cardio - vascular disease prevention . Thus , 165 articles were eligible for categorizing a stance on vitamin E in cardiovascular prevention . Overall Stance and Evolution Over Time . Overall , 101 citing articles ( 61 . 2 % ) were favorable , 36 ( 21 . 8 % ) were equivocal , and 28 ( 17 . 0 % ) were unfavorable ( Table 1 ) . Categorization by 2 independent investigators was con - cordant ( weighted (cid:2) 0 . 91 , 95 % CI , 0 . 87 - 0 . 94 ) .

Independent Associations of Cit - ing Article Characteristics With Fa - vorable Stance . In multivariate analy - ses , the odds of a citing article having a favorable stance were approximately 20 times lower in 2001 and 2005 , as compared with 1997 , when the HOPE trial was also cited ( odds ratios were 0 . 05 and 0 . 06 , respectively ) , but not necessarily when the HOPE trial was not cited ( T ABLE 3 ) . Moreover , the odds of a favorable stance were 12 times lower in articles published in general and internal medicine journals than in articles published in other journals ( Table 3 ) . Overall Stance of Articles Citing the HOPE Trial in 2005 . In a sample of 29 articles published in 2005 that had cited the HOPE study , 6 ( 20 . 7 % ) were still favorable to vitamin E , 11 ( 37 . 9 % ) were equivocal , and 12 ( 41 . 4 % ) were unfa - vorable . Eight of these articles had also cited one or both of the 1993 highly cited epidemiological studies . Exclud - ing these 8 articles , there were 6 ( 28 . 6 % ) favorable citations to vitamin E , 9 ( 42 . 9 % ) equivocal citations , and 6 ( 28 . 6 % ) unfavorable citations . Qualitative List of Counterargu - ments . Typical examples of counterar - guments are shown in B OX 1 . 28 - 34 Al - luded biases included study selection bias in meta - analyses or information bias due to incomplete recording of out - come events . Genuine diversity be - tween studies in favor of vitamin E and trials with negative or harmful effects focused on baseline patient character - istics ( ie , genetic background , dietary habits , stage of atherosclerotic dis - ease , oxidative stress status , and life - style of study participants ) ; vitamin E intervention—type , dosage , and bio - availability ( ie , use of synthetic vs natu - ral form of tocopherol , use of small vs higher doses of tocopherol , ingestion of vitamin E with vs without lipid - rich meals , use of balanced intake vs single antioxidant supplementation , or discrepancies in antioxidant levels in blood or tissues before and after supple - mentation ) ; concomitant interven - tions ( ie , patients supplemented with a harmful cointervention or lacking an additional useful antioxidant cointer - vention ) ; and duration of follow - up ( short - term vs long - term follow up studies ) . Diverse biological mecha - nisms were invoked in support . Box 1 . Qualitative List of Counterarguments Made to Defend Vitamin E Effectiveness Despite Contradictory Evidence From Randomized Trials Biases Selection bias : meta - analysis did not put its results in perspec - tive by reviewing the context of research on vitamin E includ - ing the many positive observational and interventional stud - ies 28 Information bias : mortality estimates from CHAOS a came from a research letter , not a peer - reviewed study , and included data after the study was officially ended , and thus subject to infor - mation bias 28 Genuine Diversity Participant Characteristics Genetic characteristics : genetic background of study subjects might have contributed to the differential results 29 Dietary habits : discrepancies may be explained by differences in the antioxidant content of the basal diet of the sample popu - lation under investigation 30 Stageofdisease : someantioxidants , eg , vitaminE , mightbemore effective in the early phase of atherosclerosis , but much less so in the advanced clinically overt stage present in the major - ity of patients evaluated in clinical trials 31 Oxidative stress status : studies that have included healthy sub - jects with decreased oxidative stress while vitamin E reduced oxidative stress in smokers ( a condition of increased oxida - tive stress ) 31 Lifestyle characteristics : lifestyle of study subjects might have contributed to the differential results 29 Intervention : Vitamin E Form , Dose , Bioavailability VitaminEform : sometrialsutilizedsynthetictocopherol , whose efficacy is not equivalent to the natural form 31 Vitamin E dose : an adequate intake in the lowest intake cat - egoryoralowinterindividualvariationintakemayexplainsomeofthenegativefindings 32 Vitamin E bioavailability : no control on how antioxidant vita - mins were ingested : the bioavailability of vitamin E is higher when it is taken with lipid - rich meals . Antioxidant levels were not consistently measured in blood or tissues before and after supplementation : the same intake may produce different lev - els in distinct individuals 31 Co - interventions Beta - carotene ( harmful co - intervention ) : most of the evidence for an elevated mortality risk came from two trials that admin - istered vitamin E together with beta - carotene 33 Lack of appropriate cointervention : . . . single antioxidant supplementation might not be a good strategy , since antioxi - dant defenses normally behave as a network : therefore bal - anced intake is likely important 31 Outcomes Duration of follow - up : the possibility that antioxidants need to be taken more than five years to have a significant effect on atherosclerotic plaque formation cannot be dismissed 34 a ReferstothemortalitydataofCHAOS , which , contrarytothemainpub - lication of the trial on cardiovascular events , had shown no benefit from vitamin E .

The overall stance of the citing articles was significantly more favorablewhenthecontradictingAlpha - Tocopherol , Beta Carotene Cancer Pre - vention Study Group and Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study were not cited ( P = . 001 and P = . 009 , respectively ) . Of the 10 favorable and the 3 equivo - cal beta - carotene citations , only 1 raised counterarguments against the contra - dicting evidence , claiming 35 that “the effectiveness of these carotenoids as an - tioxidants depends upon a number of factors ( eg , concentration , cell type , cell status , timing of insult exposure , loca - tion in the cell , interaction with other antioxidants , etc ) ” . The other 9 favor - able citing articles ( 2 reviews and 7 ex - perimental articles on human tissue and animals ) simply did not cite any trials that had contradicted beta - carotene effectiveness . For Alzheimer disease , counterargu - ments ( B OX 2 ) 36 - 43 to support estrogen pertained to various selection biases ; is - sues related to the participants , includ - ing differences in age , menopausal symptoms , prior hormonal treatment , and stage of disease ( before vs after the onset of dementia process ) ; differ - ences in the intervention scheme , in - cluding estrogen form , route of admin - istration and regimen , and cointerventions ; and choice of out - come definitions ( Box 2 ) . COMMENT Citations to the 2 highly cited obser - vational studies proposing an associa - tion of vitamin E with reduced cardio - vascular events became less favorable over time , as contradicting data from randomized trials accumulated . Nev - ertheless , despite the eventual accu - mulation of strongly refuting evi - dence , even in 2005 , half of the articles citing these epidemiological studies were still favorable to the vitamin E claim . Even among articles that cited thecontradictingHOPEtrialratherthanthepositiveepidemiologicalstudies , the majority in 2005 still could not con - clude that vitamin E was ineffective . Box 2 .

All rights reserved . Downloaded From : http : / / jama . jamanetwork . com / pdfaccess . ashx ? url = / data / journals / jama / 5251 / on 04 / 10 / 2017 Many counterarguments were raised to defend vitamin E in the face of contra - dictory evidence from RCTs . In a simi - lar fashion , in 2006 more than half of the articles citing the highly cited epi - demiologic articles on beta - carotene for cancer prevention and estrogen for de - mentia prevention remained favor - able for these interventions . For beta - carotene , after a decade had passed from the contradiction of its effectiveness , counterarguments were uncommon : citing articles simply did not mention the contradicting trials . Conversely , for estrogen , a claim for which contradic - tion has been more recent , many coun - terarguments ( of similar breadth as for vitamin E ) were raised to defend its ef - fectiveness . We observed an apparent split of stance in the scientific literature . The persistent favorable stance toward the contradicted interventions was particu - larly prominent in articles published in specialtyjournalsofbothclinicalandba - sic science disciplines . Specialist ar - ticles apparently continued to use ref - erences to the highly cited observational studies to support their own lines of re - search . The presence of refuting data were not mentioned in many articles . Other articles did report data with con - trary results , but they raised also a wide array of counterarguments to support the observational claim . Most nonran - domized studies published in specialty journals show positive results . 18 , 44 , 45 Ap - parently , there is also a citation bias se - lecting positive citations . 46 , 47 Con - versely , for journals with a more general medical audience , apparently the con - tradictingrandomizeddatacarriedmoreweightthantheobservationaldata . For beta - carotene and estrogen , almost all analyzed citations appeared in spe - cialty journals . Our citation content analysis also highlights another aspect of the exist - ing antithesis between randomized and observational research . 17 , 48 - 51 Appar - ently , the same data are used and inter - pretedentirelydifferentlybydifferentin - vestigators depending on whether they supported findings from the random - izedtrialsorobservationalstudies . How - ever , when randomized and observa - tional studies disagree , it is incorrect to assume that nonrandomized studies are always wrong . Disagreements and con - tradictionsappearalsobetweenrandom - ized trials , even large ones , and also in manyotherresearchfieldsinwhichotherdesignsareused . In the evaluation of counterargu - ments , we encountered almost any source of bias , genuine diversity , and biological reasoning invoked to de - fend the original observations . While some or even many of these counter - arguments may be valid , this is also con - sistent with a belief that is defended at all cost . The defense of the observa - tional associations was persistent , de - spite the availability of very strong con - tradicting randomized evidence on the same topic . Thus , one wonders whether any contradicted associations may ever be entirely abandoned , if such strong randomized evidence is not consid - ered as much stronger evidence on the topic . For most associations and ques - tions of medical interest , either no ran - domized data exist , or the random - ized evidence is minimal or of poor quality . 52 , 53 Our data also suggest that contra - diction through randomized trials may lead eventually to a decrease in the ab - solute frequency of citations to the epi - demiologicalstudies . However , thismay occur with considerable delay and a considerable segment of the literature continues to cite the contradicted ar - ticles long after the contradiction . The articles that cited these observational studies continued to be predomi - nantly favorable . Moreover , even when we considered articles that referenced the most prominent contradicting trial against vitamin E , clearly unfavorable citations for vitamin E were still the mi - nority . Beta - carotene , in particular , of - fers the opportunity to examine what happens when many years have passed after the contradiction : a citation rate of decreasing ( but still substantial ) vol - ume continues to support the contra - dicted claims without even mention - ing the contradicting evidence or raising counterarguments . Sometimes investigator beliefs in sci - entific circles may have similar psycho - logical characteristics as the nonscien - tific beliefs observed in other areas of society . The wish bias of individuals , irrespective of topic , can be large and may also influence the interpretation of scientific results . Such bias has been dis - cussed and demonstrated in the past for several other societal and scientific ef - forts . 54 - 59 Wish bias does not necessar - ily mean that the defended beliefs are wrong . Moreover , it can be difficult to discern whether perpetuated beliefs are based on careful consideration of all evi - dence and differential interpretation , in - appropriate entrenchment of old infor - mation , lack of dissemination of newer data , or purposeful silencing of their existence . Regardless of the reasons , better communication between re - search specialists and evidence - based clinical science 60 may improve this situ - ation and may lead to more rational and concerted translational efforts in ba - sic , preclinical , and clinical research .
