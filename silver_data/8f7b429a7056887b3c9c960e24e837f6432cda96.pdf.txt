ing epibiotic and pelagic communities . These icebergs can be compared to estuaries that supply surrounding coastal regions with nutrients . In that respect , icebergs may be thought of as “ Lagran - gian estuaries , ” drifting through the Southern Ocean while enriching the surrounding pelagic zone . Our preliminary studies suggest that free - drifting icebergs and their associated communities could serve as areas of increased production and sequestration of organic carbon to the deep sea , a process unaccounted for in current global carbon budgets ( 33 ) .

The Product Space Conditions the Development of Nations C . A . Hidalgo , 1 * † B . Klinger , 2 * A . - L . Barabási , 1 R . Hausmann 2 Economies grow by upgrading the products they produce and export . The technology , capital , institutions , and skills needed to make newer products are more easily adapted from some products than from others . Here , we study this network of relatedness between products , or “ product space , ” finding that more - sophisticated products are located in a densely connected core whereas less - sophisticated products occupy a less - connected periphery . Empirically , countries move through the product space by developing goods close to those they currently produce . Most countries can reach the core only by traversing empirically infrequent distances , which may help explain why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports and fail to converge to the income levels of rich countries . D oes the type of product that a country exports matter for subsequent economic performance ? The fathers of development economics held that it does , suggesting that indus - trialization creates spillover benefits that fuel sub - sequent growth ( 1 – 3 ) . Yet , lacking formal models , mainstream economic theory has been unable to incorporate these ideas . Instead , two approaches have been used to explain a country ’ s pattern of specialization . The first focuses on the relative pro - portion between productive factors ( i . e . , physical capital , labor , land , skills or human capital , infra - structure , andinstitutions ) ( 4 ) . Hence , poorcountries specializeingoodsintensiveinunskilledlaborandland , whereas richer countries specialize in goods requiringinfrastructure , institutions , andhumanand physical capital . The second approach emphasizes technological differences ( 5 ) and has to be com - plemented with a theory of what underlies them . The varieties and quality ladders models ( 6 , 7 ) as - sume that there is always a slightly more ad - vanced product , or just a different one , that countries can move to , disregarding product similarities when thinking about structural trans - formation and growth . Think of a product as a tree and the set of all products as a forest . A country is composed of a collection of firms , i . e . , of monkeys that live on different trees and exploit those products . The pro - cess of growth implies moving from a poorer part of the forest , where trees have little fruit , to better partsoftheforest . Thisimpliesthatmonkeyswould have to jump distances , that is , redeploy ( human , physical , and institutional ) capital toward goods that are different from those currently under produc - tion . Traditional growth theory assumes there is always a tree within reach ; hence , the structure of this forest is unimportant . However , if this forest is heterogeneous , with some dense areas and other more - deserted ones , and if monkeys can jump only limited distances , then monkeys may be un - able to move through the forest . If this is the case , the structure of this space and a country ’ s orien - tation within it become of great importance to the development of countries . In theory , many possible factors may cause relatedness between products , that is , close - ness between trees ; such as the intensity of labor , land , and capital ( 8 ) , the level of technological sophistication ( 9 , 10 ) , the inputs or outputs in - volved in a product ’ s value chain ( e . g . , cotton , yarn , cloth , and garments ) ( 11 ) , or requisite insti - 1 Center for Complex Network Research and Department of Physics , University of Notre Dame , Notre Dame , IN 46556 , USA . 2 Center for International Development , Kennedy School of Government , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA 02139 , USA . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † To whom correspondence should be addressed .

All of these are a priori notions of what dimension of similarity are most im - portant and assume that factors of production , technological sophistication , or institutional qual - ity exhibit little specificity . Instead , we take an agnostic approach and use an outcomes - based measure , based on the idea that , if two goods are related because they require similar institutions , infrastructure , physical factors , technology , or some combination thereof , they will tend to be produced in tandem , whereas dissimilar goods are less likely to be produced together . We call this measure “ proximity , ” which formalizes the intuitive idea that the ability of a country to pro - duce a product depends on its ability to produce other products . For example , a country with the ability to export apples will probably have most of the conditions suitable to export pears . They would certainly have the soil , climate , packing technologies , and frigorific trucks . In addition , they would have skilled agronomists , phyto - sanitary laws , and trade agreements that could be easily redeployed to the pear business . If instead we consider a different product such as copper wires or home appliance manufacture , all or most of the capabilities developed for the apple business render useless . We introduce proximity as the concept that captures this intuitive notion . The concept of proximity . Formally , the proximity f between products i and j is the minimum of the pairwise conditional probabil - ities of a country exporting a good given that it exports another . f i , j ¼ min f P ð RCAx i j RCAx j Þ , P ð RCAx j j RCAx i Þg Where RCA stands for revealed comparative advantage ( 14 ) RCA c , i ¼ x ð c ; i Þ ∑ i x ð c , i Þ , ∑ c x ð c , i Þ ∑ c , i x ð c , i Þ which measures whether a country c exports more of good i , as a share of its total exports , than the “ average ” country ( RCA > 1 not RCA < 1 ) . We used international trade data , cleaned and made compatible ( 15 ) through a National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) project lead by R . Feenstra ( 16 ) , disaggregated according to the Standardized International Trade Code at the four - digit level ( SITC - 4 ) , providing for each country the value exported to all other countries for 775 product classes . With these data , we calculatedthe775 - by - 775matrix ofrevealed prox - imities between every pair of products by using the equation above . A hierarchically clustered version of the matrix is shown ( Fig . 1A ) . A smooth and homogeneous product space would imply uniform values ( ho - mogenous coloring ) , whereas a product - ladder model ( 7 ) wouldsuggesta matrixwithhigh values ( or bright coloring ) only along the diagonal . In - stead the product space of Fig . 1A appears to be modular ( 17 , 18 ) , with some goods highly con - nected and others disconnected . Furthermore , as a whole the product space is sparse , with f ij dis - tributed according to a broad distribution ( fig . S2 ) with 5 % of its elements equal to zero , 32 % of them smaller than 0 . 1 , and 65 % of the entries taking values below 0 . 2 . These substantial number of negligible connections call for a network rep - resentation ( 19 ) , allowing us to explore the structure of the product space together with the proximity between products of given classifica - tions and participation in world trade . To offer a visualization in which all 775 products are in - cluded , we reached all nodes by calculating the maximum spanning tree , which includes the 774 links maximizing the tree ’ s added proximity ( fig . S4 ) and superposed on it all links with a proximity larger than 0 . 55 ( figs . S5 and S6 ) . This set of 1525 links is used to visualize the structure of the full proximity matrix , which is far from homogenous and appears to have a core - periphery structure ( Fig . 1B ) . The core is formed by metal products , machinery , and chemicals , whereas the periphery is formed by the rest of the product classes . The products in the top of the periphery belong to fish - ing , tropical , and cereal agriculture . To the left there is a strong peripheral cluster formed by garments and another one belonging to textiles , followed by animal agriculture . The bottom of the network shows a large electronics cluster , fol - lowed to the right by mining , forest , and paper products . The network shows clusters of products some - what related to the classification introduced by Latin America and the Caribbean East Asia Pacific Sub - Saharan Africa Industrialized Countries Fig . 2 .

S8 ) , that is , the relative amount of capital , labor , land , or skills required to produce each product . Although the classification performed by Leamer was done with a different methodology , the agreement between it and the structure of the product space is striking . Yet it also introduces a more detailed split of some pro - duct classes . For example , machinery is naturally split into two clusters , one consisting of vehicles and heavy machinery and another one belonging to electronics . The machinery cluster is interwo - ven with some capital - intensive metal products but is not tightly connected to similarly classified products such as textiles . The map obtained can be used to analyze the evolution of a country ’ s productive structure . For this purpose we held the product space fixed and studied the dynamics of production within it , although changes in the product space represent an interesting avenue for future re - search ( 20 ) . The pattern of specialization for four regions in the product space is shown in Fig . 2 ( 21 ) . Products exported by a region with RCA > 1 are shown with black squares . Industrialized coun - tries occupy the core , composed of machinery , metal products , and chemicals . They also partic - ipate in more peripheral products such as textiles , forest products , and animal agriculture . East Asian countries have developed RCA in the garments , electronics , and textile clusters , whereas Latin America and the Caribbean are further out in the periphery in mining , agriculture , and the gar - ments sector . Lastly , sub - Saharan Africa exports few product types , all of which are in the far periphery of the product space . These results in - dicate that each region has a distinguishable pat - tern of specialization clearly visible in the product space . Links to the maps for the 132 countries included in the study can be found in the Sup - porting Online Material ( SOM ) text . Next , we show how the structure of the product space affects a country ’ s pattern of specialization . Figure 3A shows how comparative advantages evolved in Malaysia and Colombia between 1980 and 2000 in the electronics and the garments sectors , respectively . Both countries follow a dif - fusion process in which comparative advantage move preferentially toward products close to ex - isting goods : garments in Colombia and elec - tronics in Malaysia . Testing diffusion . Beyond this graphical illustration , is it true that countries develop comparative advantage preferentially in nearby goods ? We used two different approaches to this question . First , we measured the average prox - imity of a new potential product j to a country ’ s current productive structure , which we call “ density ” and define as w kj ¼ ∑ i x i f ij ∑ i f ij where w kj is the density around good j given the export basket of the k th country and x i = 1 if RCA ki > 1 and 0 otherwise . A high density value means that the k th country has many developed products surrounding the j th product . To study the evolution of comparative advantage , we con - sidered “ transition products ” as those with an RCA c , i < 0 . 5in1990andan RCA c , i > 1in1995 . As a control , we considered “ undeveloped products ” those that in 1990 and 1995 had an RCA c , i < 0 . 5 and disregarded those cases not fitting any of these two criteria . Figure 3B shows how density is distributed around transition products ( yellow ) and compares it to densities around undeveloped products ( red ) . Clearly , these distributions are very distinct , with a higher density around transition products than among undeveloped ones [ analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) P < 10 − 30 ] . At the single product level , we considered the ratio between the average density of all countries in which the j th product was a transition product and the average density of all countries in which the j th product was not developed . Formally , we define the “ discovery factor ” H j as H j ¼ ∑ T k ¼ 1 w kj = T ∑ N k ¼ T þ 1 w kj = ð N − T Þ where T is the number of countries in which the j th good was a transition product and N is the total number of countries . Figure 3C shows the fre - quency distribution of this ratio . For 79 % of products , this ratio is greater than 1 , indicating that w jk is greater in countries that transitioned into the j th good than in those that did not , often substantially .

There is a monotonic relationship ( Fig . 3D ) between the proximity of the nearest developed good and the probability of transitioning into it . Although the probability of moving into a good at f = 0 . 1 in the course of 5 years is almost nil , the probability is about 15 % if the closest good is at f = 0 . 8 ( 22 ) . Because production shifts to nearby products , we asked whether the product space is sufficient - ly connected that given enough time , all countries can reach most of it , particularly the richest parts . Lack of connectedness may explain the difficul - ties faced by countries trying to converge to the income levels of rich countries : they may not be able to undergo structural transformation because proximities are just too low . A simple approach is to calculate the relative size of the largest connected component as a function of f .

We studied the impact of the product space structure by simulating how the position of countries evolve when allowed to repeatedly move to products with proximities greater than a certain f o . If countries diffuse to nearby products and these are sufficiently connected to others , then after several iterations , 20 in our exercise , countrieswould beable toreach richer partsof the product space . On the other hand , if the product spaceis disconnected , countries willnotbeableto find paths to the richer part of the product space , independently of how many steps they are al - lowed to make . The results of our simulation for Chile and Korea are presented in Fig . 4A . At a relatively low proximity ( f o = 0 . 55 ) , both countries are able to diffuse through to the core of the product space ; however , Korea is able to do so much faster , thanks to its positioning in core products . For higher proximities , the question becomes whether a country can spread at all . At f o = 0 . 6 , Chile is able to spread slowly throughout the space , whereas Korea is still able to populate the core after four rounds . At f o = 0 . 65 , Chile is not able to diffuse , lacking any close - enough products , whereas Korea develops RCA slowly to a few products close to the machinery and electronics cluster . To generalize this analysis for the whole world , we needed a measure to summarize the position of a country in the product space . We adopted a measure based on Hausmann , Hwang , and Rodrik ( 23 ) , which involves a two - stage process . First , for every product we assigned a value , which is the weighted gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita of countries with comparative advantage in that good , called PRODY ( 23 ) . We then averaged the PRODYs of the top N products that a country has access to after M iterations at f o and denoted it by < PRODY > NM f o . Figure 4B shows the distri - bution of < PRODY > NM f o for N = 50 , M = 20 , and f o = 1 ( green ) , f o = 0 . 65 ( yellow ) , and f = 0 . 55 ( red ) . The distribution for f o = 1 allows us to characterize the current distribution of countries in the product space , which shows a bimodal distribution , a signature of a world divided into rich and poor countries with few countries occupying the center of the distribu - tion . When we allow countries to diffuse up to f o = 0 . 65 , this distribution does not change sig - nificantly : it shifts slightly to the right because of the acquisition of a limited number of sophis - ticated products by some countries . This diffu - sion process , however , stops after a few rounds , and the world maintains a degree of inequality similar to its current state . Contrarily , when we consider f o = 0 . 55 , most countries are able to diffuse and reach the most sophisticated basket in the long run . Only a few countries are left behind , which unsurprisingly make up the poor - est end of the income distribution . To quantify the level of convergence we calculated the interquartile range ( IQR ) for the < PRODY > 5020 f distribution and normalized this quantity by dividing it with the IQR for the original distribution . Figure 4C shows that the convergence of the system goes through an abrupt transition and that convergence is possible if countries are able to diffuse to products located at a proximity f > 0 . 65 . The bimodal distribution of international in - come levels and a lack of convergence of the poor toward the rich has been explained by using geographic ( 24 ) and institutional ( 12 , 13 ) argu - ments . Here , we introduced another factor to this discussion : the difficulties involved in moving through the product space . The detailed structure of the product space is shown here and , together with the location of the countries and the characteristics of the diffusion process undergone by them , strongly suggests that not all countries face the same opportunities when it comes to development . Poorer countries tend to be located in the periphery , where moving toward new products is harder to achieve . More interestingly , among countries with a similar level of develop - ment and seemingly similar levels of production and export sophistication , there is significant variation in the option set implied by their current productive structure , with some on a path to continued structural transformation and growth and others stuck in a dead end . These findings have important consequences for economic policy , because the incentives to promote structural transformation in the presence of proximate opportunities are quite different from those required when a country hits a dead end . It is quite difficult for production to shift to products far away in the space , and therefore policies to promote large jumps are more challenging . Yet it is precisely these long jumps that generate subsequent structural transforma - tion , convergence , and growth . References and Notes 1 . A .

The network shown here represents the structure of the product space as determined from the 1998 – 2000 periods . Holding the product space as fixed is a good first approximation , because the dynamics of the network is much slower than the one of countries . The Pearson correlation coefficient ( PCC ) between the proximity of all links present in this network and the ones obtained from the same network in 1990 and 1985 are 0 . 69 and 0 . 66 , respectively ( SOM text ) . This indicates that , although the network changes over time , after 15 years the strength of past links still predicts the strength of the current links to a considerable extent . 21 . An alternative approach in which the network of trade relationships was studied was undertaken by ( 28 – 30 ) . 22 . We repeated the same exercise with the rank of proximity instead of proximity itself in order to assess whether what matters is absolute or relative proximity . We found that absolute distance appears to be what matters most . Although transition probability increases linearly with proximity , they decay with rank as a power law . Moreover , the rank effect is stronger for products in sparser parts of the product space , where transitions are also less frequent . Thus , densely connected products can develop RCA through more paths than sparsely connected ones , indicating the importance of absolute proximity . 23 . We follow the methodology developed in Hausmann , Hwang , and Rodrik ( 31 ) , which weighs the GDP per capita of each country exporting that product by the RCA that the country has in that good . 24 .
