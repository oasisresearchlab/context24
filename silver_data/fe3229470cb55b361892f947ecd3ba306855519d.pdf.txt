INTRODUCTION Caveolae are small , 50 - 80 nm omega - shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane deﬁned on the basis of their morphological appearance in electron micrographs ( invaginated caveolae ) ( Devine et al . , 1971 ; Forbes et al . , 1979 ; Gabella , 1978 ; Parton , 1996 ; Parton and Simons , 1995 ; Parton et al . , 1997 ) . They are not present in all cell types and their abundance varies greatly among cell types ( Parton , 1996 ) . Despite extensive research their function is still not clear . Evidence has been presented that they are involved in a number of cellular processes such as signal transduction ( Lisanti et al . , 1994 ) , calcium signalling ( Fujimoto , 1993 ) , potocytosis ( Anderson et al . , 1992 ) and endocytosis ( Schnitzer et al . , 1996 ) . Furthermore , some glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - linked receptors like the urokinase plasminogen receptor ( Stahl and Mueller , 1995 ) , the folate receptor ( Mayor et al . , 1994 ; Rothberg et al . , 1990 ; Turek et al . , 1993 ) and the membrane spanning tissue factor ( Sevinsky et al . , 1996 ) , a key component of the coagulation cascade , have been reported to be localized to caveolae or organized in microdomains associated with caveolae ( Schnitzer et al . , 1995 ) . A major structural component of caveolae is the membrane protein caveolin . Caveolin - 1 , which is found in a variety of tissues , was both identiﬁed as a major component of the vesicular transport system in the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) ( Kurzchalia et al . , 1992 ) and as a structural component of the caveolar coat ( Dupree et al . , 1993 ; Rothberg et al . , 1992 ) . It is a 21 kDa integral membrane protein and is found as a homooligomer in the cell ( Monier et al . , 1995 ) . However , newly synthesized caveolin - 1 forms oligomers in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) indicating that oligomerization is a characteristic of caveolin - 1 rather than an indication of caveolae localization ( Monier et al . , 1995 ) . Caveolin - 1 is inserted in the plasma membrane as a hair pin structure with both the N and the C terminal facing the cytosol ( Monier et al . , 1995 ) , and it is a cholesterol binding protein ( Murata et al . , 1995 ) . Recently , two more caveolins have been identiﬁed , caveolin - 2 ( Scherer et al . , 1996 ) which is expressed in the same cells as caveolin - 1 , and caveolin - 3 ( Tang et al . , 1996 ) , which is expressed in muscle . Little is known about caveolae biogenesis , except that caveolin and cholesterol is required ( Parton , 1996 ) . Fra et al . ( 1995 ) have shown that introduction of canine caveolin - 1 into human lymphocytes , which do not normally form caveolae , was sufficient for caveolar formation . Likewise , Engelman et 825 Journal of Cell Science 111 , 825 - 832 ( 1998 ) Printed in Great Britain © The Company of Biologists Limited 1998 JCS9716 We have studied caveolin - 1 expression and the frequency and distribution of typical invaginated caveolae as they are identiﬁed by electron microscopy in the polarized epithelial cell lines MDCK II and Caco - 2 . In wild - type MDCK II cells caveolin expression is high and more than 400 caveolae / mm ﬁlter were observed at the basolateral membrane . No caveolae were found at the apical surface . By contrast , wild - type Caco - 2 cells do not express caveolin - 1 and have extremely few , if any caveolae . Caco - 2 cells were stably transfected with the gene for caveolin - 1 in order to investigate if the formation of caveolae is polarized also in these cells . We have isolated Caco - 2 clones expressing different levels of caveolin - 1 , where the level of expression varies from 10 - 100 % of the endogenous level in MDCK II cells . Caveolin - 1 expression in Caco - 2 cells gives rise to a marked immunoﬂuorescense labeling mainly at the lateral plasma membrane . By electron microscopy an increase from less than 4 caveolae / mm ﬁlter in wild - type Caco - 2 cells to 21 - 76 caveolae / mm ﬁlter in Caco - 2 clones transfected with caveolin - 1 was revealed and these caveolae were exclusively localized to the basolateral membrane . Thus expression of heterologous caveolin - 1 in Caco - 2 cells leads to polarized formation of caveolae , but there is a lack of correlation between the amount of caveolin expressed in the cells and the number of caveolae , suggesting that factors in addition to caveolin are required for generation of caveolae .

( 1997 ) recently found that transfection of human cell lines with human caveolin resulted in the formation of caveolae . However , it is unclear whether some factors are required in addition to caveolin . Such factors could be present in some but not in other cell types , and caveolin expression in itself might therefore not necessarily lead to caveolae formation . In support of this , transfection of insect cells with caveolin - 1 resulted in accumulation of caveolin - 1 positive vesicles without leading to morphologically deﬁned caveolae at the plasma membrane ( Li et al . , 1996 ) . In polarized epithelia it is an open question whether caveolae formation is polarized . Since caveolin has been reported to be involved in transport from the TGN to the apical surface in polarized MDCK cells ( Kurzchalia et al . , 1992 ) and since GPI - anchored proteins , which are sorted to the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells , have been proposed to associate with caveolin ( Lisanti et al . , 1993 ; Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ; Zurzolo et al . , 1994 ) , it is often implied that caveolae must be present at this surface ( Joliot et al . , 1997 ; Lisanti et al . , 1993 ) . In the present study we have therefore asked the following questions : ( 1 ) are caveolae localized apically , basolaterally or both in the widely used canine cell line MDCK II which normally expresses caveolin - 1 ? ( 2 ) does canine caveolin - 1 expression lead , as in human lymphocytes , to generation of caveolae in polarized human Caco - 2 cells , which normally do not express caveolin and have no caveolae ( Mirre et al . , 1996 ) ? and ( 3 ) are such caveolae formed at random or localized either at the apical or basolateral surface ? We show here that caveolae are localized basolaterally in MDCK II cells , that caveolin expression in Caco - 2 cells at a level comparable to that seen in MDCK II cells leads to formation of caveolae exclusively at the basolateral surface and that the number of newly formed caveolae is much lower than the number of caveolae in MDCK II cells . Furthermore , the amount of caveolin in the transfected Caco - 2 clones did not correlate with their ability to form caveolae . We therefore suggest that formation of caveolae in polarized epithelia is a basolateral phenomenon and that factors in addition to caveolin are involved . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture Caco - 2 and MDCK II cells were grown in T25 ﬂasks ( Nunc , Roskilde , Denmark ) , on glass coverslips or on Transwell ﬁlters ( Costar ; pore size 0 . 4 m m , diameter 24 . 5 mm , cells seeded at a density of 10 6 per ﬁlter ) in DMEM ( Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s MEM ) , 10 % or 5 % fetal calf serum , respectively , 2 mM glutamine , 100 units / ml penicillin , 100 m g / ml streptomycin . Caco - 2 cells were further supplemented with nonessential amino acids . Transfected Caco - 2 clones were also supplemented with 0 . 65 mg / ml G418 ( Life Technologies ) . For inhibition of protein kinase C , the Caco - 2 cells were incubated in normal medium containing either 1 or 10 m M phorbol - 12 myristate - 13 acetate or 5 or 10 m M bisindolylmalemide for 24 hours before processing for electron microscopy ( EM ) . Caco - 2 cells were incubated for 3 days in growth medium containing 1 . 5 mM butyric acid to investigate whether differentiation could induce caveolae formation . Construction of expression vectors cDNA encoding caveolin / VIP21 isolated from MDCK II ( Kurzchalia et al . , 1992 ) inserted into the Eco RI - Xho I sites of pBluescript was a generous gift from K . Simons , EMBL , Heidelberg . The 890 bp Eco RI - Xho I fragment encoding the cDNA was excised and inserted into pUHD10 - 3 ( obtained from H . Bujard ; Gossen and Bujard , 1992 ) and excised as a Eco RI - Bam HI fragment of similar size . This fragment was inserted into pTej4 or pTej8 resulting in pUV47 and pUV51 , respectively ( both pTej4 and pTej8 were generous gifts from T . E . Johansen ; Johansen et al . , 1990 ) . pTej4 is an eukaryote expression vector where expression of the gene inserted in the multicloning site is driven by the strong , constitutive promotor , p Ubc ( Johansen et al . , 1990 ) . pTej8 is similar to pTej4 , except that it also encodes the neomycin phosphotransferase gene , giving resistance to G418 ( Johansen et al . , 1990 ) . Caco - 2 cells were either transfected with pUV47 alone or by cotransfection of pUV51 and pSV 2 - neo using the calcium precipitation method as described ( Vogel et al . , 1995 ) . The transfected cells were selected using 0 . 65 mg / ml G418 , and stable clones were isolated after 3 weeks using cloning cylinders . Western blots Cells were scraped off in PBS ( phosphate buffer saline ) and pelleted . The pellet was suspended in 1 volume PBS and 1 volume 2 · sample buffer ( Novex , San Diego ) containing 100 mM DTT . The samples were heated to 100°C for 5 minutes , or incubated at 25°C for 30 minutes and subjected to standard SDS - PAGE either on 12 % gels or on 4 - 12 % Novex gradient gels . The proteins were immobilized on Hybond™ECL™ nitrocellulose membrane ( Amersham , Buckinghamshire , UK ) by semi - dry transfer , and processed for western blots . A polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of human caveolin ( sc - 894 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) was used as primary antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 in 5 % non - fat milk , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , PBS ) . As secondary antibody , HRP - linked donkey anti - rabbit antibody ( Amersham life science ) was used . ECL™ ( Amersham ) was used as detection method . Triton X - 100 insolubility Triton X - 100 insolubility assay was performed as described by Danielsen ( 1995 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were lysed and incubated in 25 mM Hepes , 150 mM NaCl , pH 6 . 5 , 1 % Triton X - 100 for 10 minutes on ice with frequent vortexing , and centrifuged at 48 , 000 g for 30 minutes . The pellet was solubilized in sample buffer , and equal volumes of solubilized pellet and supernatant were analysed by SDS - PAGE and western blotting as described . Immunoﬂuorescence Cells grown in T25 ﬂasks , on glass coverslips or on ﬁlters were washed in PBS and ﬁxed in 2 % formaldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 2 , for 1 hour at room temperature ( all subsequent incubations were performed at room temperature ) . The formaldehyde was quenched with 25 mM glycine in PBS , and the cells permeabilized with 0 . 2 % saponin in PBS for 1 hour or by 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 15 minutes . The cells were blocked for 15 minutes with 5 % normal goat serum in PBS and incubated in the same buffer for one hour with the polyclonal anti - caveolin antibody sc - 894 also used for western blots diluted 1 : 100 . After 3 times 10 minute washes in PBS , the cells were incubated for 30 minutes with FITC - conjugated goat anti - rabbit antibody ( Southern Biotechnology Associates , Inc . Birmingham , USA ) , diluted 1 : 50 in 5 % normal goat serum in PBS . The cells were then washed 4 times 10 minutes in PBS and dried . Electron microscopy Conﬂuent cultures of MDCK II and Caco - 2 cells grown on ﬁlters were rinsed with PBS and ﬁxed with 2 % formaldehyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 2 . Following ﬁxation , the cells on ﬁlters were cut free of the plastic insert , postﬁxed in OsO 4 , contrasted en bloc with 1 % uranyl acetate , dehydrated in a graded series of ethanols , and embedded in epon . Sections were cut perpendicular to the ﬁlter and collected on Formvar - coated mesh grids and examined in a Philips CM100 electron microscope . With respect to quantitative analysis , see Results .

For transfection of Caco - 2 cells we used 2 different plasmids expressing caveolin - 1 cDNA isolated from MDCK II cells ( Kurzchalia et al . , 1992 ) . The 2 plasmids both expressed caveolin - 1 cDNA from the strong , constitutive promoter p Ubc ( Johansen et al . , 1990 ) . Thirteen of 36 isolated Caco - 2 clones could be ampliﬁed . Nine of 13 analysed clones expressed detectable levels of caveolin . Seven of these clones are shown in Fig . 1 . The different clones vary in the level of expression of caveolin - 1 from 10 % of the level seen in MDCK II cells to a level similar to that seen in MDCK II cells ( Table 1 ) . The recombinant caveolin has the same mobility as the native caveolin seen in MDCK II cells on denaturing acrylamide gels ( Fig . 1 ) . Characterization of the caveolin - 1 expressed in Caco - 2 cells Caveolin present in caveolae and in TGN transport vesicles has been shown to be insoluble in Triton X - 100 at 0°C and it has been pointed out that this detergent insolubility probably reﬂects the biophysical properties of the protein ( Fra et al . , 1994 ; Kurzchalia et al . , 1992 ; Mirre et al . , 1996 ; Parton , 1996 ) . It has also been shown that caveolin - 1 is resistant to SDS at low temperatures ( 25°C ) , whereas it dissociates upon boiling ( Monier et al . , 1995 ) . The caveolin - 1 expressed by the highly expressing Caco - 2 clone ( 33 / 4 ) and the low expressing Caco - 2 clone ( 33 / 2 ) both turned out to be Triton X - 100 insoluble ( Fig . 2A ) and form 200 kDa complexes on SDS - PAGE after incubation at 25°C ( Fig . 2B ) thus behaving like caveolin - 1 from other sources . We determined the localization of caveolin - 1 in the Caco - 2 cells by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy using the sc - 894 antibody which only seems to recognize caveolin in caveolae ( Dupree et al . , 1993 ) . No caveolin could be detected in wt and mock transfected Caco - 2 cells ( Fig . 3A ) , conﬁrming our observations made with western blotting ( Fig . 1 ) . In the transfected clones , labeling with sc - 894 revealed a distinct , sometimes ﬁne dotted ﬂuorescence mainly of the lateral plasma membrane ( Fig . 3B ) . No such labeling was seen when the focal plane was shifted to the top or bottom of the cell monolayer . Fig . 1 . Western blot of Caco - 2 clones transfected with canine caveolin - 1 cDNA .

The western blot in Fig . 1 was quantiﬁed by scanning densitometry using a Mustek Paragon MFS 12000 ex transparent scanner . The bands were quantiﬁed using a software program , Scimage ( Vanck , Denmark ) . * No caveolae were identiﬁed at the apical surface in any of the cell lines / clones . †The amount in MDCK II was arbitrarily set to 100 % . ‡Scanning value is not from the gel shown in Fig . 1 . 828 Taken together , these data indicate that a large fraction of the caveolin - 1 expressed in the Caco - 2 clones behaves as endogeneous caveolae - associated caveolin - 1 . However , to which extent the expressed caveolin - 1 actually gives rise to formation of caveolae can only be determined by electron microscopy ( EM ) . Frequency and distribution of caveolae in Caco - 2 and MDCK II cells The frequency and distribution of caveolae were studied by EM of MDCK II and Caco - 2 cells grown on ﬁlters ( Figs 4 , 5 ) . The term caveolae as used here is deﬁned strictly morphologically as characteristic 50 - 80 nm invaginations of the plasma membrane which are readily identiﬁed by EM ( Fig . 5 ) ( Parton and Simons , 1995 ; Parton 1996 ) . It is clear that caveolae which may exist in a ﬂattened ( non - invaginated ) form and therefore cannot be distinguished from the other portions of the plasma U . Vogel , K .

Low magniﬁcation electron micrograph of MDCK II cells grown on a ﬁlter . The length of this portion of epithelial monolayer is approx . 110 m m , corresponding to about 12 epithelial cells . In such a portion there is on average about 50 caveolae which open towards the basolateral surface ; no caveolae are found on the apical surface .

Electron micrographs showing examples of caveolae in Caco - 2 cells expressing caveolin - 1 ( clone 33 / 2 , A - E ) , and in MDCK II cells ( F ) . The arrows indicate various examples of caveolae opening to the cell surface as they are deﬁned for quantiﬁcation . Accordingly , proﬁles like those labeled with asterisks ( C and F ) are not included although they may represent caveolae . Note that in Caco - 2 cells the caveolae are associated with the lateral plasma membrane ( Lm ) rather than with the basal plasma membrane ( Bm ) . ( A and B ) Two clathrin - coated pits ( Cp ) to show that caveolae and clathrin coated pits are readily distinguished in our preparations . F shows the basal part of an MDCK II cell ; here the caveolae are associated with the basal plasma membrane ( Bm ) . Fil , ﬁlter . Bar , 100 nm . 830 membrane ( Smart et al . , 1996 ) are not included . Moreover , for quantiﬁcation we only included invaginated caveolae which clearly opened to the cell surface ( Fig . 5 ) . This is likely to give an underestimate of the total number of caveolae since some must appear as ‘free’ vesicles in a random , single section . Caveolae which do not open to the cell surface in a given section can be accounted for by ﬁxation with Ruthenium Red ( van Deurs et al . , 1996 ) , but this approach , which gave roughly 2 . 5 times higher counts , makes the precise deﬁnition of caveolae more difficult and was therefore not used ( data not shown ) . For each cell line / clone two different portions of a ﬁlter grown , conﬂuent epithelial monolayer cut perpendicular to the ﬁlter were selected at low magniﬁcation ( Fig . 4 ) , and then caveolae were identiﬁed and counted along the basal cell membrane facing the ﬁlter as well as at the lateral and apical surfaces at high magniﬁcation ( Fig . 5 ) . Finally the ﬁlter portions , typically 100 - 200 m m of ﬁlter corresponding to the distance between the grid bars , were photographed at low magniﬁcation ( · 700 ) to measure the length of ﬁlter examined ( Fig . 4 ) . The number of caveolae per mm of ﬁlter was then calculated as the mean of the two ﬁlter portions ( n = 1 ) . The quantiﬁcation revealed that there was on average 433 caveolae per mm ﬁlter associated with the basolateral membrane in wt MDCK II cells ( Table 1 ) . The caveolae were predominantly ( > 70 % ) associated with the basal cell membrane facing the ﬁlter , although the lateral part of the basolateral membrane represents by far the largest surface area due to folding or interdigitations . Moreover , the caveolae were not evenly distributed but often appeared as patches with 3 - 10 caveolae ( as judged from a single thin section ) ( Fig . 5F ) . Accordingly , long stretches of basal plasma membrane were devoid of caveolae . Finally it should be stressed that no caveolae were identiﬁed at the apical surface . In wt Caco - 2 cells , less than four caveolae - like structures per mm ﬁlter were observed ( Table 1 ) . This is in agreement with the lack of caveolin - 1 expression in these cells . However , the Caco - 2 clones transfected with caveolin had 21 - 76 caveolae / mm ﬁlter , and thus signiﬁcantly more caveolae than the wt Caco - 2 cells ( Table 1 and Fig . 5A - E ) . Control experiments showed that mock transfection of control cells did not signiﬁcantly change the low frequency of caveolae in wt Caco - 2 cells . Several intriguing observations were made in relation to caveolin expression and the occurrence of caveolae in the Caco - 2 clones . First , even though the level of caveolin expression in some Caco - 2 clones was comparable to that of wt MDCK II cells there was no correlation between the amount of expressed caveolin and the number of caveolae . On the contrary , it seems that the Caco - 2 clones which have medium and low expression of caveolin ( clones 33 / 2 and 50 / 1 , Table 1 ) , have more caveolae than clones expressing high levels of caveolin ( 33 / 4 and 50 / 5 ) . Overall , the number of caveolae were six to ten times lower than in wt MDCK II cells ( Table 1 ) . Second , the caveolae in the Caco - 2 clones were localized to the lateral membranes ( Fig . 5B - E ) ; with a few exceptions caveolae were not observed at the basal membrane facing the ﬁlter , in contrast to the situation in MDCK II cells . On the other hand , clathrin - coated pits were sometimes seen at the basal membrane . Third , caveolae were not observed at the apical surface of Caco - 2 clones although there appeared to be space enough between the highly differentiated microvilli for possible caveole - formation and moreover , clathrin coated pits were frequently seen at the apical surface of Caco - 2 cells ( not shown ) . Since caveolin may not only be associated with plasmalemmal caveolae but also with various vesicular and other membrane structures within the cytosol , including TGN elements ( Joliot et al . , 1997 ; Kurzchalia et al . , 1992 ; Li et al . , 1996 ; Parton et al . , 1997 ) , we were attentive to the possible existence of such membrane material in particular in the vicinity of the lateral plasma membrane in the transfected Caco - 2 cells . However , no increase in vesicles and other membrane structures was noticed in any clone . The only way to distinguish wt Caco - 2 cells from transfected Caco - 2 clones in blind experiments was to carefully count caveolae . Clone 33 / 4 expresses a lot of caveolin , little of which thus seems to participate in formation of caveolae ( Table 1 ) . It is therefore possible that caveolae biogenesis is repressed in the clone , since it has been shown that a number of factors inﬂuence caveolae formation . For instance , activation of protein kinase C - a ( PKC - a ) has been shown to disrupt caveolae formation ( Smart et al . , 1994 , 1995 ) . If caveolae biogenesis is repressed by elevated PKC activity , inhibition of PKC - a might lead to caveolae formation . We have therefore treated clone 33 / 4 with a PKC - a inhibitor , bisindolylmalemide , and with an activator , phorbol - 12 myristate - 13 acetate ( TPA ) , since prolonged stimulation of PKC by TPA has been shown to downregulate PKC ( Young et al . , 1987 ) . Inhibition or downregulation of PKC did not , however , affect caveolae biogenesis . Furthermore , incubation with serum - free medium to avoid growth factor - induced stimulation of PKC did not increase the number of caveolae . In some cell types , the number of caveolae is affected by differentation of the cells . In adipocytes the number of caveolae is increased upon differentiation ( Fan et al . , 1983 ) and also cultured myoepithelial cells which are allowed to differentiate have numerous caveolae ( Petersen et al . , 1989 ) . Since butyric acid induces enhanced differentiation of intestinal epithelium ( Nathan et al . , 1990 ; Stoddart et al . , 1989 ) we tested whether butyric acid treatment leads to increased caveolae formation in a caveolin - 1 expressing Caco - 2 clone . However , incubation with butyric acid had no inﬂuence on caveolae formation . These results clearly show that there is not necessarily a direct correlation between the caveolin level and the number of caveolae present on the plasma membrane , and importantly the data also demonstrate that there is a polarized distribution of caveolae in the two epithelial cell lines studied . DISCUSSION The most important result of the present study is that the formation of invaginated caveolae is polarized both in MDCK II cells and in Caco - 2 cells transfected with caveolin . In MDCK II cells such caveolae are predominantly present at the basal membrane , although some are observed at the lateral membrane . In contrast , caveolae were almost exclusively found at the lateral membrane in the Caco - 2 clones expressing caveolin - 1 . One can speculate whether this indicates that the basolateral membrane is really two distinct domains , the basal and the lateral membrane , with different functional characteristics , varying among epithelial cells . U . Vogel , K . Sandvig and B . van Deurs 831 Caveolin - 1 expression and caveolae The polarized distribution of caveolae is not caused by an unequal distribution of cholesterol in the apical and the basolateral membrane , since the molar percentage of cholesterol in these 2 membranes is the same ( 30 % ) ( Simons and van Meer , 1988 ) . The formation of invaginated caveolae exclusively at the basolateral side of epithelial cells studied so far is interesting , because there is a high amount of glycolipids at the apical side of epithelial cells , and glycolipid rich domains may be associated with caveolin ( Lisanti et al . , 1993 ; Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ; Zurzolo et al . , 1994 ) . Moreover , caveolin - 1 is present in transport vesicles from the TGN which contains the apically destined inﬂuenza haemagglutinin ( Kurzchalia et al . , 1992 ) . It has therefore been implied that caveolae are present at the apical membrane of polarized cells although it has not been shown by EM ( Joliot et al . , 1997 ; Lisanti et al . , 1994 ) . Importantly , caveolin is also found in vesicular stomatitis virus G protein - positive basolaterally destined transport vesicles in MDCK II cells ( Kurzchalia et al . , 1992 ) . Whether only caveolin associated with these vesicles or also caveolin originally directed to the apical surface is involved in basolateral caveolae formation is still not known . Thus , it seems that caveolin - 1 is transported to the apical surface in MDCK II cells without this leading to caveolae formation . The polarized formation of caveolae is also of interest in relation to the sorting of GPI - anchored proteins . For exampel the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor has been localized to caveolae ( Stahl and Mueller , 1995 ) and is apically sorted in MDCK cells ( Limongi et al . , 1995 ) . Since caveolae are present only at the basolateral membrane of polarized MDCK cells , the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor cannot be localized to caveolae in such cells . One can therefore question the physiological signiﬁcance of the caveolar localization of the receptor . It has been reported that apical sorting of other GPI - anchored proteins is also linked to their localization in caveolae in polarized MDCK cells ( Lisanti et al . , 1993 ; Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ) . This now seems less likely . However , it is possible that caveolin present in the TGN is involved in sorting , since the GPI - anchored fusion protein gD1 - DAF ( Zurzolo et al . , 1994 ) and the urokinase - type plasminogen activator ( Canipari et al . , 1992 ) are sorted differently in MDCK cells , which express caveolin , and in Fisher rat thyroid cells or Caco - 2 cells , which do not express caveolin . It would certainly be interesting to study protein sorting in Caco - 2 cells with and without caveolin expression . In this study we used the canine cDNA for caveolin - 1 since this molecule has previously been used to induce caveolae in human lymphocytes ( Fra et al . , 1995 ) and since we are here comparing the localization of caveolae in Caco - 2 cells with that in the widely used canine cell line MDCK II . We ﬁnd it unlikely , however , that transfection of Caco - 2 cells with human caveolin cDNA might change the distribution of caveolae since there are only minor differences between canine and human caveolin - 1 ( Scherer et al . , 1996 ; Tang et al . , 1996 ) . We here show that expression of canine caveolin - 1 generates caveolae in Caco - 2 cells which normally do not form caveolae . This is in agreement with a recent report by Fra et al . ( 1995 ) , who found formation of caveolae upon transfection of lymphocytes with caveolin - 1 . However , Fra et al . ( 1995 ) found a positive correlation between the level of caveolin expression and the number of caveolae upon transfection of lymphocytes with caveolin - 1 . In the present study , we show that in Caco - 2 clones there is no correlation between the level of caveolin expression and the number of caveolae ( Table 1 ) . There are a number of possible explanations for this somewhat surprising result . Mutations in the cDNA are unlikely , since the number of caveolae in the clones expressing low levels of caveolin correlates with the caveolin level , indicating the expression of a fully functional protein ( clone 33 / 2 and 50 / 1 , Table 1 ) . Alternatively , a high number of caveolae may be toxic to Caco - 2 cells , so only clones that either express moderate amounts of caveolin or express high amounts of caveolin that do not cause formation of caveolae could be ampliﬁed . Since caveolin - 1 has no designated function , it is hard to test if the protein is active . However , the caveolin expressed in clone 33 / 4 has the correct mobility on SDS - PAGE , forms oligomers in vivo and is Triton X - 100 insoluble , like caveolin in other cell types . It is possible that caveolae formation in Caco - 2 cells may require other proteins in addition to caveolin - 1 and that newly synthesized caveolin in the absence of such proteins associates with intracellular ( non - caveolar ) membranes . This seems to be true for some other expression systems for caveolin - 1 , since expression of caveolin - 1 in insect cells leads to a huge accumulation of caveolin - 1 positive intracellular vesicles ( Li et al . , 1996 ) . Furthermore , according to these authors the caveolin - 1 positive membrane structures identiﬁed as caveolae in the caveolin - 1 transfected lymphocytes ( Fra et al . , 1995 ) were also predominantly intracellular vesicles . However , we did not observe accumulation of vesicular and other membrane structures by EM of the caveolin - expressing Caco - 2 cells . Moreover , immunoﬂuorescence labeling of caveolin - 1 in the Caco - 2 clones transfected with caveolin - 1 indicates that caveolin - 1 is predominantly localized to the lateral plasma membrane . Caveolae were originally identiﬁed on the basis of their structure as invaginations on the plasma membrane with a characteristic shape and size . It has later been proposed by different groups that caveolae are able to close and form vesicles ( Rothberg et al . , 1990 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1996 ) . However , when caveolae are closed they are indistinguishable from other vesicles which happen to be of the same size . Consequently , cryo - immunogold labelling has been used to identify caveolin - positive membrane structures . This may be a problem since transport vesicles from the TGN also contain caveolin - 1 . In previous transfection studies there has apparently been no differentiation between morphologically deﬁned caveolae and caveolin - 1 positive vesicles ( Joliot et al . , 1997 ; Li et al . , 1996 ) . We believe it is important for future studies to distinguish between caveolin - 1 positive vesicles of unknown origin and function and morphologically well - deﬁned caveolae if caveolar function and biogenesis is to be elucidated . It will also be interesting to investigate to which extent other polarized cells have a polarized distribution of caveolae .
