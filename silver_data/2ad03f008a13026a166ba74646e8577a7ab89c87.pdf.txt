The mammalian MVB path - way is not yet fully defined , however . Hence , it is unclear D - 69120 Heidelberg Germany whether other proteins in the MVB pathway participate in HIV - 1 budding . 4 Myriad Pharmaceuticals , Inc . Salt Lake City , Utah 84108 Genetic screens in yeast have defined 17 different proteins that appear to play direct roles in MVB biogene - sis ( reviewed in Katzmann et al . , 2002 ) . All are required for v acuolar p rotein s orting ( VPS ) , and are termed “class Summary E” proteins because their deletion or inactivation in - duces formation of abnormally enlarged , highly tubu - HIV release requires TSG101 , a cellular factor that sorts proteinsinto vesiclesthat budinto multivesicular lated endosomal membrane compartments that fail to mature normally into MVBs ( termed “class E compart - bodies ( MVB ) . To test whether other proteins involved in MVB biogenesis ( the class E proteins ) also partici - ments” ) . Recent studies by Emr and coworkers have revealed that most class E proteins exist predominantly pate in HIV release , we identified 22 candidate human class E proteins . These proteins were connected into as soluble proteins or subcomplexes that are sequen - tially recruited from the cytoplasm to function at sites of a coherent network by 43 different protein - protein interactions , with AIP1 playing a key role in linking MVB vesicle formation ( termed ESCRTs , for E ndosomal S orting C omplexes R equired for T ransport ) ( Babst et complexes that act early ( TSG101 / ESCRT - I ) and late ( CHMP4 / ESCRT - III ) in the pathway .

Detection methods , interactions ( in brackets ) and relevant protein fragments ( in parentheses ) were : a ) Yeast two - hybrid screens of cDNA libraries : [ 6 ] ( TSG101 317 – 390 / VPS28 10 – 221 ) , [ 11 ] ( TSG101 1 – 266 / AIP1 584 – 868 ) , [ 19 ] ( EAP30 43 – 258 / CHMP6 1 – 130 ) , [ 20 ] ( EAP45 317 – 386 / CHMP6 1 – 130 ) ; b ) Directed yeast two - hybrid screens [ 4 , 6 , 8 – 9 , 11 – 12 , 15 – 18 , 21 – 30 , 32 – 35 , and 38 – 41 ] ( all full - length proteins ) ; c ) Interactions between purified proteins detected using GST pull - down assays : [ 13 ] ( AIP1 1 – 716 / EIAV p9 ) , [ 14 ] ( AIP 1 – 716 / HIV - 1 p6 ) , [ 16 ] ( AIP1 1 – 716 / CHMP4B ) , and [ 9 , 30 – 32 , 36 – 37 , 42 – 43 ] ( all full - length proteins ) ; d ) Interactions between purified proteins detected using Biacore biosensor : [ 11 ] ( Tsg101 1 – 145 / AIP1 714 – 723 ) . References for previously reported interactions are : [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] ( Asao et al . , 1997 ) , [ 3 ] ( Bache et al . , 2003a ; Lu et al . , 2003 ; Pornillos et al . , 2003 ) , [ 4 ] ( Martin - Serrano et al . , 2003 ) , [ 5 ] ( Demirov et al . , 2002a ; Garrus et al . , 2001 ; Martin - Serrano et al . , 2001 ; Human Class E Proteins and HIV Budding 703 form a stable complex in mammalian cells ( Kamura et and CHMP2B did not show any positive interactions . Our experiments reconfirmed several yeast two - hybrid al . , 2001 ) . In several cases , a single yeast protein apparently has interactions described previously in mammalian sys - tems : TGS101 / TSG101 ( Martin - Serrano et al . , 2003 ) , two or more human orthologs , implying greater com - plexity in the mammalian MVB pathway . This is most TSG101 / VPS28 ( Bishop and Woodman , 2001 ) , AIP1 / AIP1 ( Chatellard - Causse et al . , 2002 ) , CHMP1A / VPS4B , evident late in the pathway ; e . g . , the single yeast Vps4p protein has two apparent human orthologs : VPS4A and and CHMP2A / VPS4B ( Howard et al . , 2001 ) . We also found a series of interactions that were previously un - VPS4B , and the six related proteins of the yeast ESCRT - III class have 10 apparent human orthologs , the ch arged documented in mammalian systems , but were analo - gous to interactions previously described in yeast ( e . g . , M VB p roteins or CHMP proteins . The six yeast proteins perform distinct functions : two ( Vps32p / Snf7p and CHMP4B / CHMP6 , AIP1 / CHMP4A - C ) ( Babst et al . , 2002a ; Odorizzi et al . , 2003 ) , or were consistent with biochemi - Vps20p ) form a proximal lattice that binds directly to the MVB membrane , two ( Vps2p / Did4p and Vps24p ) form a cal or genetic experiments in yeast ( e . g . , ESCRT - I re - cruits ESCRT - II to the endosomal membrane ( Babst et distal layer on the first , and the remaining two ( Did2p and Vps60p / Mos10p ) apparently have partially redun - al . , 2002b ) , Snf7p ( CHMP4A - C ) recruits Bro1p ( AIP1 ) ( Odorizzi et al . , 2003 ) , and ESCRT - II recruits Vps20p dant and / or regulatory roles ( Babst et al . , 2002a ) . A phy - logenetic analysis showed that the 10 related human ( CHMP6 ) ( Babst et al . , 2002b ) . It is therefore apparent that the MVB pathway is conserved in outline from yeast CHMP proteins can also be subdivided into six analo - gous groups ( Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure S1 to man . Importantly , our two screens revealed 25 new class available on Cell website ) . E protein - protein interactions that had not previously been described in any system . These included the first Protein Interactions within the Human Vps Class E Protein Network links between ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II ( TSG101 / EAP45 , TSG101 / EAP30 ) , and between ESCRT - I and AIP1 Extensive yeast two - hybrid analyses were performed to test our model for the human MVB pathway and to iden - ( TSG101 / AIP1 ) . Collectively , our data imply a hierarchy of protein interactions required for MVB formation , with tify new protein - protein interactions that could link the entire protein network together , which has not been HRS complexrecruiting ESCRT - I ; ESCRT - I recruitingAIP1 and ESCRT - II ; AIP1 and ESCRT - II recruiting ESCRT - III ; possible in any system including yeast . Potential inter - actions between human class E proteins were tested and ESCRT - III recruiting VPS4A / B ( see Figure 1A ) . using both random library screening and directed yeast two - hybrid assays , which provided overlapping and TSG101 / AIP1 Interactions The novel interaction between TSG101 and AIP1 de - complementary information ( Figure 1 , Supplemental Figure S1 and Table S1 available on Cell website ) . In tected in the yeast two - hybrid experiments was charac - terized in greater detail because it provided , to our the random screen , early ( TSG101 ) and late ( CHMP6 ) acting class E proteins were used as baits in automated knowledge , the first direct link between the human ESCRT - I and ESCRT - III complexes . Deletion analyses screens of human cDNA libraries , with multiple con - structs employed to identify interacting domains . These revealed that the N - terminal UEV domain of TSG101 ( residues 1 – 145 ) bound the proline - rich C - terminal re - screens confirmed one previously known TSG101 inter - action , TSG101 / VPS28 ( Bishop and Woodman , 2001 ) , gion of AIP1 ( residues 586 – 868 ) ( Figures 1B and 2A ) . The TSG101 UEV domain binds specifically to P ( S / T ) AP and revealed three novel interactions : TSG101 / AIP1 , CHMP6 / EAP30 , and CHMP6 / EAP45 . All four interactions sequences , but a mutation in the UEV domain ( M95A ) abolishes P ( S / T ) AP binding ( Pornillos et al . , 2002a , were confirmed in semiquantitative liquid (cid:1) - galactosi - dase two - hybrid assays ( Figure 1B ) . 2002b ) . The M95Amutationalsoeliminated AIP1binding to both the full - length and TSG101 1 – 145 proteins ( Figure The directed screen tested for all possible intra - and intermolecular interactions between the 18 human class 2A , far right , red bar ) , indicating that the TSG101 UEV domain bound a P ( S / T ) AP - like sequence in the proline - E proteins predicted to act downstream of TSG101 ( in - cluding TSG101 itself ) . A total of 28 interactions were rich region of AIP1 . There is a conserved PSAP motif within the proline - identified and 16 of the 18 proteins tested interacted with at least one other class E protein ( Figures 1A and rich region of AIP1 ( residues 717 – 720 ) , and we therefore tested whether the TSG101 UEV domain could bind this 1C ) . CHMP5 constructs were toxic or self - activating , VerPlank et al . , 2001 ) , [ 6 ] ( Bishop and Woodman , 2001 ) , [ 7 ] ( Kamura et al . , 2001 ) , [ 8 ] and [ 9 ] ( Howard et al . , 2001 ) , [ 10 ] ( Scheuring et al . , 2001 ) , [ 12 ] ( Chatellard - Causse et al . , 2002 ) and [ 14 ] ( Strack et al . , 2003 ) .

Positive signals from yeast expressing prey - AD / bait - BD pairs ( black bars ) are shown together with signals from control cells expressing AD / bait - BD ( yellow ) and prey - AD / BD pairs ( blue ) . Interaction numbers ( below ) correspond to those in Figure 1A , and the HRS / TSG101 interaction served as a positive control ( Pornillos et al . , 2003 ) . Signals were normalized relative to the appropriate positive signal ( given in fluorescence units adjacent to black bars ) .

From left to right , each image shows X - (cid:2) - gal signals from yeast patches containing AD / bait - BD ( negative control ) , prey - AD / BD ( negative control ) , and prey - AD / bait - BD ( positive interaction ) . All interactions shown were positive in multiple repetitions of these experiments and are denoted as strong ( s , signal in 1 – 2 days ) , medium ( m , signal in 3 days ) , and weak ( w , signal in 4 or more days ) . Very weak interactions not scored as positive were : CHMP3 / CHMP4B , CHMP1B / VPS4B , CHMP4B / EAP45 , and CHMP6 / VPS4A . Note that some two - hybrid interactions could be mediated via bridging yeast proteins . Cell704 Figure 2 .

However , mutations that disrupt the TSG101 / CHMP Proteins Bind VPS4 Proteins Yeast two - hybrid interactions linked many of the Gag interaction typically inhibit HIV - 1 release to a much greater extent than do mutations that disrupt the AIP1 / ESCRT - III / CHMP proteins to the two human VPS4 pro - teins , and we therefore tested whether recombinant Gag interaction , indicating that the class E proteins are probably recruited primarily through the TSG101 / Gag VPS4 and CHMP proteins could interact directly . As shown in Figure 3C , pure recombinant mammalian interaction ( Demirovetal . , 2002b ; Go ¨ ttlingeretal . , 1991 ) . It has also been suggested that AIP1 may bind to the VPS4A and VPS4B proteins bound to GST - CHMP1B ( lanes 6 and 7 ) and GST - CHMP2A ( lanes 9 and 10 ) but YPDL late domain found in the p9 domain of the equine infectious anemia virus ( EIAV ) Gag ( Vincent et al . , 2003 ) . not to GST alone ( lanes 3 and 4 ) . Analogous VPS4 bind - ing interactions were also seen for the two other CHMP Although AP - 2 was initially described as a cellular bind - ing partner for the YPDL late domain ( Puffer et al . , 1998 ) , proteins tested ( CHMP4B and CHMP6 , data not shown ) . These observations imply that , as in yeast ( Babst et al . , this has been puzzling because AP - 2 functions primarily in endocytosis rather than MVB formation . More re - 2002a ) , the mammalian VPS4 enzymes likely act directly on the subunits of the CHMP protein lattice . cently , however , AIP1 has been proposed as an alterna - tive binding partner for the EIAV late domain because AIP1 orthologs from several organisms can bind YPXL HIV - 1 Packaging and Gag Colocalization of Human Class E Proteins sequences ( Vincent et al . , 2003 ) . We therefore tested whether AIP1 and EIAV - p9 could form a complex in vitro . Cellular factors that participate in viral budding may be packaged into virions , and we have previously shown As shown in Figure 3A ( lane 9 ) , AIP1 1 – 716 bound GST - p9 and this interaction was specific for the p9 23 YPDL 26 late thattheESCRT - IproteinsTSG101andVPS28arespecif - ically packaged into HIV - 1 virions ( J .

Thus , AIP1 can bind both HIV - 1 p6 and EIAV p9 , indicating that both tested for virion incorporation , however . We therefore analyzed purified HIV - 1 particles from acutely infected viruses enter the mammalian class E protein network , at least in part , through direct interactions with AIP1 . human MT4 cells for the presence of AIP1 , CHMP1A , Human Class E Proteins and HIV Budding 707 CHMP2A , VPS4A , and VPS4B .

Similar results were obtained for dominant - negative versions of the CHMP2A All of the proteins tested were readily detected in cell extracts ( Figure 4A and data not shown ) . However , only and VPS4A proteins ( data not shown ) . Moreover , the degree to which Gag - GFP redistributed apparently de - AIP1 and VPS4B were present in multiple independent preparations of HIV - 1 particles , with a significantly pended upon TSG101 binding to Gag , as colocalization of wt Gag - GFP / DsRed - CHMP4B was observed in 68 % stronger signal for AIP1 ( Figure 4A , lanes labeled virions 1 , 2 * , and 3 ) .

Absolute levels of vi - CHMP and VPS4 proteins cause Gag proteins to accu - mulate together with TSG101 and other trapped class rion - associated proteins were estimated by comparing virus - associated CA , AIP1 , and VPS4B proteins against E proteins on the surface of aberrant late endosomal compartments . known quantities of recombinant proteins . 5 – 10 ng of AIP1 and 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 ng of VPS4B per (cid:5) g of CA were de - tected .

A DN CHMP1A protein can be created by fusing large polypeptides to the protein’s C terminus ( Howard et al . , 2001 ) . We found , however , that The PTAP Late Domain Helps Target HIV - 1 Gag to Mammalian Class E Compartments many such CHMP fusion constructs were cytotoxic and reduced Gag protein expression . We therefore surveyed In most cell lines , HIV - 1 Gag is released primarily from the plasma membrane , whereas in macrophages the a series of 25 N - and C - terminal CHMP fusion proteins for the ability to inhibit virus release without strongly virus buds directly into MVB / late endosomal compart - ments ( Pelchen - Matthews et al . , 2003 ; Raposo et al . , reducing Gag expression ( see Supplemental Table S2 available on Cell website ) . 2002 ) . Thesetwo observationscan beunified bya model in which : ( 1 ) Gag is targeted to the late endosome As shown in Figure 5A , HIV - 1 release was dramatically inhibited by coexpression with CFP - CHMP4C , DsRed - through interactions with the class E proteins ; ( 2 ) Gag then traffics to the plasma membrane via an endosomal CHMP2A , DsRed - CHMP4B , and CHMP3 - YFP .

The most dramatic effects wereobserved for the CFP - ATP binding ( K180Q ) or hydrolysis ( E235Q ) ( see also Fujita et al . , 2003 ) , and a dominant - negative CHMP4B CHMP4C construct , which did not alter cellular Gag expression levels , but reduced virus release to nearly protein was created by fusing DsRed to the protein’s N terminus ( Howard et al . , 2001 ) .

Nevertheless , there were two indications Our studies also begin to define the different roles of that cellular protein complexes might be functioning at human class E proteins in MVB biogenesis .

In either case , we speculate that viral protein binding to the recognition this entire network during viral egress ( see Figure 7 ) . Most importantly , HIV - 1 release can be arrested at a domains of TSG101 and AIP1 may serve not only to recruit the machinery of vesicle formation , but also to late stage by deletion or mutation of at least 8 different human class E proteins , which function both early alter normal protein - protein interactions required during protein sorting and MVB vesicle formation .

They are also enriched in at least one Moloney Murine Leukemia Gag protein traffics along endosomal membranes before appearing at the plasma protein that functions very late in the pathway ( VPS4B ) , Cell710 membrane ( Basyuk et al . , 2003 ) . Moreover , several known late domains ( PTAP , PPXY , YPDL , and / or LXXL ) groups have demonstrated that in macrophages , HIV - 1 ( Garrus et al . , 2001 ; Martin - Serrano et al . , 2003 ) . buds primarily into intracellular compartments that cor - In conclusion , multiple classes of enveloped viruses respond to multivesicular bodies ( Pelchen - Matthews et utilize the unique budding topology of MVB vesicles as al . , 2003 ; Raposo et al . , 2002 ) .
