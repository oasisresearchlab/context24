Yet , journals’ titles and their overview , aim and scope ( i . e . , journal’s mission statement – JMS ( s ) have not been investigated with the same diligence . This study aims to conduct a comprehensive outlook of titles and JMS ' s lexical structure and identify significant differences between journals’ prestige and type of access groups and their JMS content in the field of business , management and accounting ( BMA ) . Lexical network analysis was used to explore journals ' title structure . JMS were examined through the Flesch - Kincaid grade level for readability and the Yule’s K for lexical diversity . Titles and JMS structural analysis reflected current and critical discussion in BMA : an obsession for counterintuitive findings and ICT tools . JMS expressed mostly target customers and markets . JMS from reputable journals showed a higher betweenness for key - terms related to rigorous features , while JMS of lower reputable journals highlighted indexing attributes ( i . e . , Scopus ) . Wilcoxon rank - sum and Kruskal - Wallis tests showed significant differences in the JMS median diversity regarding the journal’s type of access and best quartiles . Keywords : Journals titles ; Mission statement ; Readability ; Lexical diversity ; Social Network Analysis 1 Introduction How should we name our new journal ? What could be the title , statement and scope differentiation content to brief our audience ? Are those features described clearly and richly enough ? Bottom line , does all of that have any association with bibliometric performance ( output and citations ) ? Leading journals ( e . g . , Scientometrics , Research Evaluation , or Academy of Management Journal ) possess a cemented cumulative advantage ( Merton , 1968 , 1988 ; Price , 1976 ) , and these questions are not vertical priorities for their editors and administrators . Granted , space to publish in such journals is scarce ( Bornmann & Marx , 2012 ) more so for researchers outside premier institutions in developing countries ( Bravo et al . , 2018 ; Dell’Anno et al . , 2020 ; Smith et al . , 2014 ) . However , the landscape has been changing . Between 2019 - 2020 the bibliographic database Scopus added 820 new journals ( Elsevier - Scopus , 2021 ; SCImago , 2020 ) . Six percent of the journals were classified into the business , 3 management , and accounting ( BMA ) subject area ( Elsevier - Scopus , 2021 ; SCImago , 2020 ) . Whilst new periodicals are emerging , readers and authors are eager to look around for journals with a clear and attractive title and statement / scope that eventually will catch or fit their attention , research interests and subsequent use ( Rostami et al . , 2014 ) . When it comes to choosing a journal likely to publish a researcher’s work from developing countries , some shortcuts can be considered —looking at journal rankings ( SCImago , 2020 ) , indexation ( Clarivate Analytics , 2021 ) or manuscript - journal matching services ( e . g . , Elsevier’s or Wiley’s journal finder ; Springer’s journal suggester ) . Masten and Aschcraft ( 2017 ) outlined the proper characteristics to avoid predatory and identify credible journals , such as i ) intuitive website ; ii ) clear editor and editorial board information ; iii ) clear publisher information ; iv ) clear archiving and indexing ; v ) clear identification of the journal affiliation / sponsorship . This study focuses on the factors directly related to the questions outlined at the beginning of this introduction , namely an intuitive website , clear publisher information and journal characteristics , hereafter a journal’s mission statement ( s ) ( JMS ) ( Table 1 ) . [ Table 1 about here ] In BMA , there is well - established research on mission statement ( s ) ( MS ) contents and its association with organisational performance ( Bart , 1997 , 2001 ; Bart & Baetz , 1998 ; Bart & Hupfer , 2004 ; Bart & Tabone , 2000 ; Cortés - Sánchez , 2018 ; Cortés - Sánchez & Rivera , 2019 ; Desmidt et al . , 2011 ; Fitzgerald & Cunningham , 2016 ; Gharleghi et al . , 2011 ; Godoy - Bejarano & Tellez - Falla , 2017 ; Palmer & Short , 2008 ; Pandey et al . , 2017 ; Williams , 2008 ) . The MS content should express at least four key concepts , namely purpose ( why the organisation exists ) , values ( what it believes in ) , standards and behaviours ( the rules / norms that shape its operations ) , and strategy ( long - term planning and pathway for achieving its purpose ) ( Campbell , 1989 ) . Those key concepts are consistently aligned with those of the JMS . Table 1 proposes how MS and JMS are interrelated ( e . g . , The Intuitive website content characteristic of the JMS is related with the Purpose concept of the MS , since in it “the journal scope of content is well - defined and aligns with journal’s title , article content and expectation of typical professional readers of the journal , instead of containing a broad scope of content” ) . Among the findings related to MS and organisational performance , it could be highlighted that MS with central content features , such as readability ( i . e . , clarity , brevity ) , lexical diversity , among others ( e . g . , mention of values / beliefs , social responsibility , lack of financial goals , positive language ) are positively related to 4 financial - innovation performance in organisations ( Bart & Baetz , 1998 ; Bartkus et al . , 2006 ; Berbegal - Mirabent et al . , 2019 ; Cortés - Sánchez & Rivera , 2019 ; Duygulu et al . , 2016 ; Godoy - Bejarano & Tellez - Falla , 2017 ; Zhang et al . , 2015 ) . In the field of informetrics , on the other hand , there is an established agenda that seeks to disentangle the relationship between articles title , keywords , or abstract content ( i . e . , length , informativeness , accuracy , readability , presence of colons / question marks , changes over time ) and their properties ( i . e . , length of the article , number of tables / figures ) , number of authors and performance ( i . e . , downloads or citations count ) ( Aleixandre - Benavent et al . , 2014 ; Didegah & Thelwall , 2013 ; Haslam et al . , 2008 ; Jamali & Nikzad , 2011 ; Lewison & Hartley , 2005 ; Li & Xu , 2019 ; Méndez et al . , 2014 ; Rostami et al . , 2014 ; Sahragard & Meihami , 2016 ; Uddin & Khan , 2016 ; Yitzhaki , 1994 , 1997 , 2002 ) . However , journals ' titles and JMS are overlooked by that stream , despite their importance in describing a journal’s main topics , history , disciplinary incidence , publication frequency , preferred epistemology ( i . e . , empirical or theoretical ) and methods , alternative scholarly communications ( e . g . , letter to editors , essay , reviews ) , audience , geographical scope , membership , among other features . Furthermore , little research has been conducted related to readability and lexical diversity regardless of their importance for improving understanding performance and reflecting credibility and communication competence in written messages , vertical assets for emerging journals ( Dillard & Pfau , 2012 ; Linsley & Lawrence , 2007 ; Rennekamp , 2012 ) . This study’s aims are twofold . First , to conduct a comprehensive outlook of the content structure of titles and JMS . Second , to identify significant differences between journals’ prestige and type of access groups and JMS content in readability and lexical diversity terms . It considers journals in BMA given the relevance and experience in the processes of researching , constructing and implementing MS . Semantic networks will be used for analysing the structure of titles and JMS . Readability and lexical diversity metrics will be used for analysing JMS attributes . Titles were excluded from the latter analysis considering that titles per se are too small for exploring their lexical diversity or readability compared to JMS . On that count , this study contributes to a structural assessment of journal titles and JMS quality in terms of readability and lexical diversity . It also adds to the literature on strategic planning and scholarly communication meta - knowledge ( Evans & Foster , 2011 ) . Results and open - access datasets could be useful for research institutions and editorials strategic planning activities related to the launch of new journals or improvement in the JMS of ongoing periodicals . Following this 5 introduction , the article presents the methodology ( data , methods and software ) . Then , it presents the discussion of the results . Finally , it presents the conclusion , restrictions and further research agenda . 2 Methodology 2 . 1 Data Scopus was chosen over Web of Science ( WoS ) due to its broader journal coverage and the participation of researchers from developing countries ( Baas et al . , 2020 ; Mongeon & Paul - Hus , 2016 ) . The SCImago journal ranking ( 2020 ) and the Scopus source list ( 2021 ) were chosen as a base - line list for collecting the JMS and additional information ( Table 2 ) . The journals considered for the final sample were those active as of 2019 indexed in at least one of the BMA categories ( i . e . , accounting ; business and international management ; industrial relations ; management information systems ; management of technology and innovation ; marketing ; organisational behaviour and human resource management ; strategy and management ; tourism , leisure and hospitality ; and miscellaneous ) . A group of three research assistants curated by hand the JMS from the journals’ website . Websites had either an overview ( 12 . 7 % ) , additional information ( e . g . , journal’s aim , mission , objective , scope ) ( 47 % ) , or both ( 40 . 3 % ) . When the two options related to the JMS were available , both were sourced and unified in a single JMS . A total of 1 , 502 JMS were collected . The SCImago Journal Rank ( SJR ) best quartiles were considered a proxy for journals’ prestige and bibliometric performance ( Guerrero - Bote & Moya - Anegón , 2012 ) . Type of access was classified in two status : registered either in the Directory of Open Access Journals ( DOAJ ) or the Directory of Open Access Scholarly Resources ( ROAD ) or non - registered ( DOAJ , n . d . ; ROAD , n . d . ) , henceforth , OA and non - OA . Journals’ type of access was considered as a crucial group considering the current structural changes in the scholarly communication dynamics due to the open access - science agenda ( Chavarro et al . , 2018 ; Jamali et al . , 2016 ; Mayr , 2006 ) . Table 2 presents the summary of variables considered . The complete dataset is available in the following permanent link : [ available upon request ] . [ Table 2 about here ] 2 . 2 Methods and software For the titles and JMS structure , semantic network analysis was used . For the JMS content analysis ( i . e . , readability and lexical diversity ) the Flesch - Kincaid grade level 6 and Yule’s K were employed . There are four types of networks : social , technological , biological and informational ( Newman , 2003 ) . The semantic networks here structured belong to the latter type . Semantic networks aim to examine the relationship among symbols’ shared meaning ( Doerfel & Barnett , 1999 ) . First , each journal’s title and JMS were passed to tokens ( i . e . , “ [ T ] his or that word on a single line of a single page of a single copy of a book” ( Peirce , 1906 , pp . 505 – 506 ) ) . Punctuation , stop words and little - informative words ( e . g . , journal ) were removed . A co - occurrence matrix was assembled to compute the number and direction of co - occurrences of tokens ( e . g . , in the last phrase , the token “co - occurrence ( s ) ” co - occurred twice with the tokens “matrix” and “tokens” ; both co - occurrences were directed from “co - occurrence ( s ) ” to “matrix” and “tokens” ) . Finally , a directed - weighted semantic network was assembled based on the co - occurrence matrix . As a result , one can formally explore both the titles and JMS’s key - terms underlying structure at a macro , meso and micro level with a diverse set of metrics . At the macro level , the metrics considered were density and average path length , at the meso level , modularity , and , at the micro level , betweenness centrality ( Wasserman & Faust , 2003 ) . Density indicates how connected the titles and JMS key - terms are ( i . e . , the number of connections that exist compared to the number of potential connections that could exist ) , and the average path length illuminates the average number of steps along the shortest path for every pair of nodes ( i . e . , key - terms ) in a network ( Brandes , 2001 ; Iacobucci et al . , 2018 ) . It can also be understood as a measure of information flow efficiency ( i . e . , the closer to 1 , the more efficient ) . Regarding the meso metrics , modularity indicates if there is a community - type structure in the network and the number of clusters formed ( i . e . , the higher the modularity , the denser the connections among nodes within clusters , and the sparse connection between nodes in other clusters ) ( Blondel et al . , 2008 ; Traag et al . , 2019 ) . A higher betweenness score unveils a node’s capacity to enable information flow between clusters ( Opsahl et al . , 2010 ) . Readability indices compute the clarity of texts intending to drop unnecessary complexities . One of the most used indices is the Flesch - Kincaid grade level ( FKGL ) ( Sattari et al . , 2011 ) . Rudolf Flesch and J . Peter Kincaid developed it to assess the United States Navy ' s technical manuals ' readability . In essence , it approximates the American school equivalent grade needed to comprehend a given text at the first reading ( Kincaid et al . , 1975 ) . For instance , this paragraph FKGL is 9 , which means that a person of about 15 - 16 years would understand this paragraph with no difficulty . The equation for the FKGL calculation is : 7 𝐹𝐾𝐺𝐿 = 0 . 39 ( 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑠 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠 ) + 11 . 8 ( 𝑠𝑦𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑠 ) − 15 . 59 Source : Kincaid et al . ( 1975 ) . Based on Twedie and Baayen ' s ( 1998 ) review on the assessments of the lexical richness of texts , the Yule’s K was considered for analysing the lexical diversity ( Yule , 1944 ) . The larger the Yule’s K result , the more words have been repeated and less vocabulary richness was detected in a text . Conversely , the lower the results , the higher the lexical diversity . For instance , one of the highest JMS Yule’s K results in the sample ( n = 1 , 428 ) ( i . e . , one of the lowest lexical diversity ) is the following : “The International Journal of Educational Organization and Leadership inquiries into the nature and processes of effective educational administration and leadership . ” The equation for calculating Yule’s K is : 𝐾 = 10 4 × [ − 1 𝑁 + ∑ 𝑓 𝑣 ( 𝑖 , 𝑁 ) 𝑉 𝑖 = 1 ( 𝑖 𝑁 ) 2 ] Source : Yule ( 1944 ) . Where 𝑁 refers to the total number of tokens , 𝑉 to the number of types ( i . e . , unique tokens ) , and 𝑓 𝑣 ( 𝑖 , 𝑁 ) to the number of types occurring 𝑖 times in a sample of length 𝑁 . The text corpora were processed using R’s packages quanteda and igraph ; Gephi was used for networks’ layout and metrics computation ( Bastian et al . , 2009 ; Benoit et . al . , 2020 ; R Core Team , 2014 ; The igraph core team , 2019 ) . 3 Results and discussion Figure 1 presents the titles’ semantic network layout , top - 20 frequent key - terms and network metrics . A random directed - network with the same number of nodes ( n = 608 ; wiring probability : 0 . 05 ) was generated as a comparing benchmark ( i . e . , density = 0 . 025 ; average path length = 2 . 56 ; clusters = 11 ; modularity = 0 . 152 ) . The same was done for the following two JMS networks . Compared to the random network , the titles network showed a lower density , similar average path length and higher modularity . The average path length shows that any key - term would have to contact ≈3 key - terms on average to reach another key - term . Modularity algorithm ( Blondel et al . , 2008 ) identified 21 clusters , although three clusters grouped ≈60 % of the key - terms : pink ( 32 % ) related to marketing and strategic and supply chain management ; green ( 22 . 2 % ) related to economics and finance ; and blue ( 13 . 3 % ) related to sustainability sciences . The modularity score suggests a higher interconnection within clusters and 8 loose connections between clusters . Journals’ titles contain each field’s distinctive jargon / language and share it moderately with other BMA fields . Key - term bridges between clusters are not strictly from BMA fields , such as the cases of engineering ( e . g . , Nuclear Engineering and Design ; Ecological Engineering ; Journal of Water Process Engineering ) , technology ( e . g . , Bioresource Technology ; Journal of Quality Technology ; Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Technology ) or development ( e . g . , Entrepreneurship and Regional Development ; Energy for Sustainable Development ; Career Development Quarterly ) . They seem to establish comprehensive dialogues between ( sub ) fields . [ Figure 1 about here ] Due to processing restrictions and contrasting JMS of highly reputable and emerging journals , Figures 2 and 3 present JMS analysis of the top and bottom ten percent journals according to their SJR . A random directed - network with the average number of nodes of the following two networks ( n = 3 , 580 ; wiring probability : 0 . 05 ) was generated as a comparing benchmark ( i . e . , density = 0 . 025 ; average path length = 2 . 12 ; clusters = 10 ; modularity = 0 . 061 ) . First , the top ten percent JMS showed similar density , average path length and number of clusters compared to the random network , although it showed higher modularity . The bottom ten percent JMS network metrics were similar to that of the top ten percent . In sum , both networks ' macro scores were not different from those of a random network ; however , they both differentiated themselves with a higher modularity score . Both JMS networks’ density and average path lengths were similar . In that line , any key - term of both networks would have to contact ≈2 key - terms on average to reach another key - term ( e . g . , there are , on average , two “middlemen” between two random type tokens ) . The number of clusters identified was 9 and 10 , respectively . Regarding the top ten percent JMS network , the three most crowded grouped 67 % of the key - terms : blue ( 31 % ) related to what the journals seek in manuscripts’ ( e . g . , new / original / leading / innovative , conceptual / theoretical / empirical , rigorous ) ; pink ( 28 % ) related to the professional / practical applications / methods ( e . g . , modeling , methodology , relevance , demonstrate ) and audiences ( e . g . , students , professionals , policy - makers , leaders , non - governmental , scientists , researchers ) ; and grey ( 10 % ) related to the social - environmental and geographical reach of the research ( e . g . , ecosystems , socioeconomic , municipal , communities ) . On the other hand , in the bottom ten percent JMS the three most crowded grouped 52 % of the key - terms : pink ( 22 % ) related to what the journals seek in manuscripts’ ( e . g . , original / case / wide / important / innovative ) ; green 9 ( 16 % ) related to journal attributes / focus and methodological preferences ( e . g . , peer - reviewed , quantitative / philosophical / multi - disciplinary ) ; and blue ( 15 % ) related to private institutions processes / results ( e . g . , business , industry ( ies ) , production / products / innovations , trade ) . The modularity score of the top ten percent was lower than the bottom ten JMS . Therefore , there is a loose interconnection within clusters and higher interconnectedness between clusters . In other words , the JMS jargon / language in the top ten percent are broadly shared with other JMS ( i . e . , JMS showed no systematic differentiation when expressing what JMS seek , and research applications and audiences ) . Conversely , the modularity score of the bottom ten percent JMS suggests a higher interconnectedness within clusters and more loose between clusters . Thus , JMS jargon / language is also shared with other JMS ( i . e . , JMS showed a moderate differentiation when expressing what JMS seeks and journals’ attributes and methodological preferences ) . In the top ten percent JMS , key - term bridges between clusters were related to a local scope ( e . g . , region , communities , national and international levels ) ; and critical type of scholarly communication ( e . g . , critical evaluation , critical management studies , critical essays and other types of communication s ) . Both JMS networks share the key - term : life . Life was a widely used key - term , related from biological sciences ( e . g . , life sciences ) to marketing - related concepts ( e . g . , product life cycle ) . In the case of the bottom ten percent JMS , the key - terms with the highest betweenness were year ( e . g . , the advance of the discipline in a temporal framework or the journal’s coverage or timely contribution to the field ) ; interested , as in the interests of the journal regarding a manuscript attribute or the public interested ( e . g . , manuscripts that break the field ; state of the art research ; academics and practitioners as target audience ) ; and learn ( e . g . , learn from the discipline or when the disciplines learn from other actors ) . It is crucial to notice that the indexing ( i . e . , Scopus ) is a critical intermediate feature in the JMS of the bottom ten percent . [ Figure 2 about here ] Table 3 presents the summary statistics for JMS FKGL and Yule’s K . Overall , the readability and lexical diversity of JMS is considerably lower . There was a small - significant correlation between FKGL and Yule’s K ( r = 0 . 1 ; n = 1 , 502 ; p = 0 . 00006 ) . Thus , increases in readability were positively  although slightly  correlated with increases in lexical diversity . The median FKGL indicates that 50 percent of the JMS have a readability score higher than 19 , which means that a person would need ≈ 19 years 10 equivalent to the US grade level to understand a text’s first reading . The median Yule’s K shows that 50 percent of the JMS have a higher lexical diversity score than ≈ 222 . Compared to best - selling books such as the Harry Potter novels , which have a Yule’s K of 69 . 38 - 77 . 12 ( Reilly , 2020 ) , JMS showed poor lexical diversity . [ Figure 3 about here ] Figures 4 and 5 present two world maps showing the median FKGL and Yule’s K of the JMS for 54 countries according to the publishers’ country with available data . As expected , there is consistency in the readability of JMS in journals that the publisher is from the English - speaking world ( e . g . , England , Ireland , USA , Canada , Australia , New Zealand ) , including other countries such as Sweden , Italy , Pakistan , Iran or Japan . On the other hand , Iberoamerican countries ( e . g . , Spain , Portugal , Colombia , Brazil , Mexico ) are among the countries with the lowest readability . Fewer JMS from non - English speaking countries showed a higher lexical diversity ( e . g . , Colombia , India , Finland ) than those from the English - speaking world ( e . g . , Australia ) . In both categories , the USA and Canada are among the few countries with higher readability and lexical diversity . Conversely , there are JMS from countries with both lower readability and lexical diversity ( e . g . , China , Russia , Ukraine , Spain ) . [ Table 3 about here ] [ Figure 4 about here ] [ Figure 5 about here ] None of the Shapiro - Wilk tests for FKGL and Yule’s K conducted for each OA and best quartile groups resulted in a p > 0 . 05 ( Shapiro & Wilk , 1965 ) . Considering that FKGL and Yule’s K were not normally distributed , the Wilcoxon rank - sum and the Kruskal - Wallis tests were used to determine significant differences between OA and non - OA , and best quartiles ( i . e . , Q1 , Q2 , Q3 , Q4 ) groups in terms of readability and lexical diversity ( Hettmansperger & McKean , 1998 ) . Results showed that the median FKGL in the OA group was 19 . 6 ( IQR = 6 . 53 ) , whereas the median in the non - OA group was 19 . 5 ( IQR = 5 . 16 ) . The Wilcoxon test showed that the difference was non - significant ( p = 0 . 19 ; effect size r = 0 . 03 ) . On the other hand , the median Yule’s K in the OA group was 229 ( IQR = 110 ) , whereas the median in the non - OA group was 222 ( IQR = 89 . 8 ) . The Wilcoxon test showed that the difference was significant ( p = 0 . 02 ; effect size r = 0 . 05 ) . There were statistically significant differences between the best quartile groups in terms of JMS readability ( p = 0 . 006 ) . Pairwise Dunn’s test between best quartile groups confirmed that the difference between Q2 ( median = 20 ; IQR = 5 . 4 ) and Q4 11 ( median = 19 ; IQR = 6 . 13 ) groups was significant ( p = 0 . 0005 , eta2 [ H ] = 0 . 006 ) . There were also statistically significant differences between best quartile groups in JMS Yule’s K ( p = 0 . 000000325 ) . Pairwise Dunn’s test between best quartile groups showed significant differences between Q1 ( median = 214 ; IQR = 84 ) and Q3 ( median = 227 ; IQR = 92 . 2 ) ( p = 0 . 017 , eta2 [ H ] = 0 . 006 ) ; and Q1 and Q4 ( median = 246 ; IQR = 125 ) ( p = 0 . 000000148 ; eta2 [ H ] = 0 . 006 ) . Also , between Q4 and Q2 ( median = 222 ; IQR = 87 . 8 ) ( p = 0 . 000575 ; eta2 [ H ] = 0 . 006 ) ; and Q4 and Q3 ( median = 227 ; IQR = 92 . 2 ) ( p = 0 . 0195 ; eta2 [ H ] = 0 . 006 ) groups . The titles network structure showed a lower density , which unveils an open - type network structure . That was also noticeable in the JMS networks . An open - type structure has its advantages and disadvantages . Open structure networks enable the flow of diverse , new and non - redundant information ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) . Closed structure networks are information - redundant but more efficient when extending control and implementing sanctions ( Stokman , 2001 ) . That reflects current discussions on the purpose of BMA - related research , regarding an incentive system that rewards novelty ( i . e . , non - redundancy ) over truth ( i . e . , heading towards an accumulated and progressive consensus ) and apply few punishments for counterintuitive but erroneous findings ( Davis , 2015 ) . The higher betweenness centrality of key - terms such as engineering and technology may be associated with the increasing role of information and communication technologies ( ICT ) tools in organisations processes and research methods ( e . g . , Big Data ) , particularly in the cluster related to marketing and strategic and supply chain management ( Davis , 2010 , 2015 ; George et al . , 2014 ) . The fraction of key - terms composing the sustainability science - related cluster support the reported success of sustainability science concepts since the 80s , its explosive growth , the diverse geographical origin of its contributors and its emphasis on management ( e . g . , of social or ecological ecosystems ) ( Bettencourt & Kaur , 2011 ) . JMS subsamples showed that the key components ( i . e . , most crowded clusters ) for a JMS were : i ) what the journals seek  and want to publish , in a way  in submitted manuscripts ; ii ) professional / practical applications / methods ; iii ) audiences ; iv ) the social - environmental and geographical reach of the research ; and v ) journal’s topics associated with mostly private institutions processes / results . Seminal work by Pearce and David ( 1987 ) proposed eight key components of a comprehensive MS : i ) the specification of target customers and markets ; ii ) the identification of principal products / services ; iii ) the specification of a geographic domain , iv ) the identification of core technologies ; v ) the expression of commitment to survival , growth and profitability ; vi ) the specification of key elements in the company’s philosophy ; vii ) the identification 12 of the company self - concept and viii ) the identification of the firm ' s desired public image . Contrasting those key components with those found in the JMS networks , JMS are mainly reflecting four Pearce and David ( 1987 ) key components : i ) the specification of target customers and markets is associated with the a ) audiences and b ) journal’s topics associated with mostly private institutions processes / results components ; ii ) the identification of principal products / services to offer ( i . e . , articles content ) is associated with the component related to what the journals seek in submitted manuscripts ; iii ) the identification of a geographic domain is associated with the social - environmental and geographical reach of the research ; and iv ) the identification of core technologies ( i . e . , means for ends ) is associated with the professional / practical applications / methods . There are several key MS components sidelined from the main JMS components detected . To synthesise , JMS could explore key components such as how the journal plans to grow and maintains its relevance and sustainability ; what is its main reason / purpose as philosophy , self - concept and the public image than it is developing or seeks to achieve in the future ( Masten & Ashcraft , 2017 , p . 5 ) . Key - terms with higher betweenness associated with identifying principal products / services to offer such as critical type and other attributes of scholarly communication ( i . e . , critical , interested ) also reflect a current fixation of the BMA related fields with interesting theories and counterintuitive facts ( Davis , 1971 ) . Pillutla and Thau ( 2013 ) argued that that focus had produced adverse effects : since the priority is to show something interesting , there is no incentive or mandate to share data for replication or triangulation , let alone expending resources testing intuitive phenomena to head towards a consensus or theory robustness ( Aarts et al . , 2015 ; Baker & Penny , 2016 ; Chawla , 2016 ) . Apart from that , there is a noticeable discrepancy among the most frequent and highly intermediate key - terms . International can be found among the top - 5 most frequent terms in the titles and JMS networks , and , at the same time , local was the key - term with the highest betweenness among the top ten percent JMS . Local’s betweenness reflects an inherent feature of the social sciences : it is local in scope and relies on national publishers ( Larivière et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , an exploratory search on Google’s Books Ngram Viewer shows that international and local  and other related terms  have increased jointly between 1800 - 1980 ( Figure 6 ) . Although , since the mid - 1990s , their use dropped . Other terms ( e . g . , global ) , meanwhile , started to emerge ( Google , 2021 ) . The betweenness score and frequent use of a local and international agenda seem to be replaced by a global 13 perspective when taking a glimpse of a broader context ( e . g . , global and : cross - cultural issues ; competitiveness ; environmental change ; political economy ; supply chain ) . [ Figure 6 about here ] The top ten percent JMS highlighted the betweenness of rigorous ( e . g , research ; articles ; contributions ; peer review ; sound theory ) , which was not detected among the bottom ten percent JMS . Both JMS subsamples mentioned the journal’s indexing , yet mentioning Scopus and years in the bottom ten percent JMS was a central attribute . Leading journals do not need to announce their indexing since their historical reputation is widely acknowledged . Emergent journals seem to use these indexing and timely factors as hooks for contributors and could be associated with the MS key component to identifying the firm ' s desired public image ( Pearce II & David , 1987 ) . Institutions also incentivise researchers to publish in Scopus’ indexed journals  excessively , in some cases  creating structural problems in the quality of BMA research output in developing countries ( Cortés - Sánchez , 2019 , 2020 ) . The higher betweenness of learn in the bottom ten percent JMS supports its high frequency in the MS of universities worldwide , particularly in the small ones ( Cortés - Sánchez , 2018 ) . Despite the relatively higher readability and diversity of JMS from countries from the English - speaking world , results are consistent with those arguing that academic and business and economics - related written pieces are far from a text understandable by a general audience ( Cortés - Sánchez & Barredo , 2020 ; Stone & Lodhia , 2019 ) . After analysing 709 , 000 + research papers abstracts , Plavén - Sigray et al . ( 2017 ) found that science ' s readability decreases overtime . As for 2015 , 22 % of abstracts have readability beyond college graduate English - level . There are no significant differences in the readability of the JMS of OA and non - OA . That contrast findings in OA journals in psychology , where Plan Language Summaries ( PLS ) ( i . e . , non - technical language briefs for a wider audience ) are being used accompanying the traditional abstracts , which happens to have a significantly higher readability than traditional abstracts ( Stricker et al . , 2020 ) . Latter results shall be interpreted cautiously since only two journals that used PLS were assessed . By comparison , the median lexical diversity of JMS in the non - OA group was significantly different and higher than the OA group . Most of the publishers that compose the non - OA are those associated with the academic publishing oligopoly , such as Elsevier or Taylor & Francis ( Larivière et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , the JMS of for - profit publishers reflects the experience in using lexical diversity in strategic communications . 14 JMS median readability was significantly different and higher only for Q4 journals than Q2 . It supports Didegah and Thelwall ' s ( 2013 ) findings on no significant association between abstracts readability and impact . A reason argued is that academics usually write abstracts for a specialised audience , even more in medicine and chemistry , while mathematics and space sciences have higher readability ( Gazni , 2011 ) . The median JMS lexical diversity was significantly different and higher in Q1 and Q2 journals than in Q3 and Q4 journals . Those findings support previous research from multiple disciplines that examined the increasing lexical diversity of article titles to address higher communicative attributes and catching readers’ attention in leading journals , likewise , the diversification of titles from articles keywords and its association with higher impact ( Méndez et al . , 2014 ; Rostami et al . , 2014 ; Yitzhaki , 2002 ) . Previous results where titles attribute such as catchiness were not associated with impact should be contemplated concerning research restrictions ( i . e . , titles were assessed manually and subjectively ) ( Haslam et al . , 2008 ) . 4 Conclusion Journals ' titles and JMS are two essential information pieces that express a journal’s main topics , history , disciplinary incidence , publication frequency , preferred epistemology ( i . e . , empirical or theoretical ) , methods , audiences , among other components . This study conducted a comprehensive outlook of the content structure of titles and JMS and identified significant differences between journal prestige and journal type of access groups and JMS content . Findings showed that both titles and JMS have an open - type network structure , enabling the flow of new information yet making that process less efficient than a closed structured network . Both titles and JMS reflect current discussions inside BMA ( e . g . , a that is interesting and counterintuitive findings obsession ; increasing use of ICT tools in methods and industry ; and a widespread incursion of sustainability sciences ) . Compared with the MS literature , JMS were restricted to the specification of target customers and markets ; identifying principal products / services to offer ; identifying a geographic domain ; and identifying core technologies , leaving aside several MS components , such as how the journal plans to grow and maintain its relevance and sustainability , its main reason / purpose as philosophy , self - concept and the public image that it is developing or seeks to achieve in the future . Reputable journals showed a distinctive key - term betweenness related to articles ' rigorous features , while the publication hook in lower reputable JMS was to be indexed in Scopus . There is a tension between the frequent use of international and 15 local betweenness . In the broader framework , both international and local are being less used over the past 20 years , while the notion of global is increasing . Both titles and JMS readability and lexical diversity are low , a phenomenon confirmed in multiple and interdisciplinary studies . However , the group of leading editorials composing the non - OA group showed JMS with higher lexical diversity . There were no significant differences between best quartile groups in terms of readability , but several significant differences emerge when exploring lexical diversity . Results are supported by previous research conducted for understanding the diversity of article titles and their association with impact . This study’s restrictions could rely on readability and diversity indices ' limitations since they cannot differentiate each reader . Further studies could source journals’ information from different sources ( e . g . , WoS ; Dimensions ; Google Scholar ) and disciplines for comparison ( e . g . , BMA vs . STEM disciplines ) . Also , adding additional article components , such as titles , abstracts , keywords , number of figures / tables , references , length , their readability and diversity and other text properties ( e . g . , sentiment dimensions : negative , positive , uncertain , litigious , constraining , superfluous , or interesting tones ) and their potential associations with journal’s use and impact in multiple spheres ( e . g . , views , downloads , altmetrics ) .
