These ﬁ ve spatial coordinates are collectively referred to as 5D . This method overcomes a long - standing challenge in distinguishing rotational motions from translational motions in the z - axis in differential interference contrast microscopy to result in full disclosure of nanoscale motions with high accuracy . Transferrin - coated endocytic gold nanorod cargoes initially undergo active rotational diffusion and display characteristic rotational motions on the membrane . Then as the cargoes being enclosed in clathrin - coated pits , they slow down the active rotation and experience a quiet period before they restore active rotational diffusion after ﬁ ssion and eventually being transported away from the original entry spots . Finally , the 3D trajectories and the accompanying rotational motions of the cargoes are resolved accurately to render the intracellular transport process in live cells .

Motions of single imaging probes recorded in SPT experiments contain rich information , including the x , y , z coordinates and the two orientation angles ( azimuthal angle ϕ and elevation angle ψ , as de ﬁ ned in Fig . 1a ) of the probe ’ s tran - sition dipole over a series of time steps . After two decades of development , lateral localization of single imaging probes with nanometer accuracy 2 – 4 in the ( x , y ) plane has become routine , and many strategies have also been developed to improve the z - tracking ability 5 – 18 . However , the ability to acquire accurate measurements in all ﬁ ve spatial parameters ( x , y , z , ϕ , ψ ) simultaneously remains elusive . These ﬁ ve coordinates are col - lectively referred to as ﬁ ve dimensions ( 5D ) in the present study . The challenges are mainly two - fold . First , it is dif ﬁ cult to resolve the dipole orientation of single ﬂ uorescent probes in a cellular environment with reasonably fast temporal resolution due to the well - known limitations , such as high background and fast photobleaching . This challenge can be circumvented by using anisotropic plasmonic gold nanorods as alternative rotational tracking probes . The exceptionally high absorption and scattering cross - sections of gold nanorods result in strong and stable signals at the localized surface plasmon resonance wavelengths 19 . We have previously developed the single particle orientation and rotational tracking ( SPORT ) technique for direct visualization of rotational dynamics of gold nanorods in differential interference contrast ( DIC ) microscopy at millisecond temporal resolution , while still obtaining high - contrast images of cellular features 20 – 23 . Relatively low illumination light intensity from a typical halogen lamp , instead of a stronger laser light source 24 brings minimal disruptions to cell functions , making it particularly suitable for long - term SPT experiments in live cells . Polarized or defocused dark ﬁ eld ( DF ) microscopy 25 – 27 is another viable choice for tracking single plasmonic gold nanoparticles , although its appli - cation to SPT in live cells is more challenging due to the generally high - scattering background in the cellular environments . In addition , the two - photon luminescence 28 and photothermal heterodyne imaging 29 can also image gold nanorods ; however , the relatively high - power laser light source and generally slow raster - scanning process can limit their applicability in single cell ima - ging . Furthermore , signi ﬁ cant progresses have also been made in measuring gold nanorods in vivo 30 – 32 ; however , these in vivo methods were not suitable for disclosing the motions of indivi - dual gold nanorods due to insuf ﬁ cient sensitivity or speed . The second challenge is associated with the dif ﬁ culties to dis - tinguish rotational motions of the anisotropic probe from its movement in the z - axis because both types of motion result in similar changes in signal in DIC microscopy . This ambiguity would result in incorrect assignment of the dipole ’ s orientation . Herein we introduce an automated ﬁ ve - dimensional single particle tracking ( 5D - SPT ) technique to overcome these chal - lenges . The core idea is to combine the DIC microscopy - based SPORT technique with the principle of parallax microscopy 15 , 16 for simultaneous spatial and rotational tracking . Parallax is a mechanism for humans to gain depth perception by creating a displacement in the apparent position of an object viewed in two eyes . It is worth noting that the dependence of the defocused DF image patterns on the probe ’ s relative axial distance to the focal plane can be utilized for axial localization 28 , 33 ; however , the complexity of the defocused image patterns and relatively weak defocused signal intensities lead to low axial localization accuracy and precision , as well as small vertical tracking distance . The 5D - SPT technique has been applied to disclose the char - acteristic motions of transferrin - coated gold nanorod cargos at each stage of the clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) pathway and subsequent intracellular transport . This technique makes signi ﬁ cant improvements in our ability to detect the presence , location , orientation , translation , and rotation of nanoparticle probes in live cells . Other worth noting advantages include the simultaneous visualization of cellular features with high contrast and the ability to follow target probes for long durations ( limited mainly by cell viability and computer data acquisition ) and in large 3D volumes ( within the camera ’ s ﬁ eld of view and the travel distance of a high - precision piezo objective scanner ) . Using the 5D - SPT technique , the current study focuses full motions of cargos in live cells have been resolved with unprecedented details and accuracy . Results Design of parallax - DIC microscopy . The SPORT technique previously developed in our laboratory takes the advantage of the plasmon resonance - associated birefringence of gold nanorods 25 , 27 , 29 , 34 and Nomarski - type DIC microscopy 35 , 36 , which utilizes two orthogonally polarized beams for illumination . Optically anisotropic gold nanorods show as diffraction - limited spots with bright and dark peaks on a gray background in DIC images ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The bright and dark intensities are independent measures of the effective projections of the nanorods onto the two polarization axes , from which the 3D orientation of gold nanorods can be resolved in each DIC image 20 , 22 , 23 . The normalized DIC bright and dark intensities traces can be readily converted to the orientation measurements . The new 5D - SPT technique uses parallax to sense the axial movement of the target object , and at the same time , employs an automatic feedback loop algorithm to control the focal plane of the objective and bring the target object back to focus repetitively . In such an implementation , the target object is kept in focus to provide the highest possible S / N for high - accuracy 2D localiza - tion and orientation determination , while the axial ( z ) positions are recorded as the positions of the high - precision objective scanner . Parallax is realized on an upright DIC microscope by inserting a wedge prism at the back focal plane of the objective ( Fig . 2 ) . Half of the light that has passed through the sample maintains the original path , while the other half of the light is deviated slightly by the wedge prism . Two images of the same sample are formed in the upper and lower halves of the sensor area . These images will be referred to as “ half - plane ” images in the rest of the discussion because each image utilizes half of the numerical aperture of the objective , while conventional microscopy images utilizing the full numerical aperture will be referred to as “ full - plane ” images . The movement of a target object in the axial ( z ) direction is resolved by monitoring the distance ( d ) between the pair of half - plane images of the same object . For any object in the focal plane , the distance between its two half - plane images ( d 0 ) is a ﬁ xed value determined by the deviation angle of the wedge prism . When the target object moves upwards ( Δ z > 0 ) towards the objective , the two half - plane images move away from one another to increase d . When the target object moves downwards ( Δ z < 0 ) away from the objective , the two images move toward one another to shorten d . Supplementary Movie 1 shows parallax - DIC images of a stationary gold nanorod at three orientations traveling smoothly from − 0 . 4 μ m below the focal plane to + 0 . 4 μ m above the focal plane at a speed of 100 nm per second with a single frame exposure time of 200 ms . The nanorod shows orientation - dependent DIC images ( Fig . 1b ) . The parallax - DIC microscope inherits the conventional DIC microscope ’ s ability of visualizing the cell morphology and detailed intracellular structures . Supplementary Fig . 2 shows the two half - plane images of a live cell at different vertical sections .

Therefore , the more complicated model - based correlation mapping procedures are required for localizing particle probes in DIC microscopy 37 , 38 . Localization in parallax - DIC microscopy is even more challenging as the half - plane PSF appears to be stretched in the direction perpendicular to the split plane , as illustrated in the simulated “ half - plane ” images ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . To overcome the complications in the parallax - DIC PSF , we have implemented a redesigned correlation mapping procedure , in which one of the half - plane images is used as the model to map the other image in order to ﬁ nd the centers of these two images . With the wedge prism splitting the light in half , the two resulting half - plane PSFs appear to be the mirror image of each other . The correlation maps of the two half - plane images with correlation scores above a set threshold ( typically 0 . 4 – 0 . 6 ) are weighed to ﬁ nd their relative coordinates . The distance between the two half - plane images is thus determined and can be translated into the axial position of the target probe . The axial localization is calibrated by scanning the focal plane of the objective vertically in 20 nm steps through a stationary gold nanorod and correlating the distance between the two images with the axial position of the sample ( Fig . 1c ) . Evaluation of 5D - SPT . The implementation ( Fig . 2 ) and eva - luation of the 5D - SPT technique are discussed in detail in the Supplementary Note 1 . The ﬁ gures of merit are summarized in this section . It is important to strike an ideal balance among temporal , spatial , and angular resolution in 5D - SPT experiments . These three types of resolving power are competing for the same pool of photons . As the temporal resolution increases , the noise level in the measured bright and dark DIC intensities increases , resulting in less accurate assessment of rotation rate and mode . The response time of the objective scanner and the speed of its interface to the computer determine the fastest temporal resolution of 5D - SPT technique to be ~ 1 ms . A series of parallax - DIC images taken at different exposure times are displayed in Supplementary Fig . 4 . To ensure suf ﬁ ciently high - angular resolution and localization precision in live cells , the 40 × 80 nm gold nanorod sample and the exposure time of 33 ms were employed in most of the 5D - SPT experiments reported in this paper , unless otherwise noted . The precision measurements of the 3D localization yield standard deviations of 11 , 14 , and 17 nm in the x , y , and z axes , respectively ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . The evaluation of the autofocusing under the parallax - DIC microscope is shown in Supplementary Fig . 6 . Finally , a set of parallax - DIC images of in - focus gold nanorod at different azimuthal angles is displayed in Fig . 1e . The bright and dark DIC intensities from each image are plot against the azimuthal angle in Fig . 1f . The orientation - dependent DIC intensities allow the orientation measurements . Tracking endocytic nanocargos in 5D - SPT . Using the 5D - SPT technique , the rotational motions of transferrin - coated gold nanorods on the cell membrane and during the subsequent endocytosis by A549 human lung cancer cells were continuously followed . Transferrin 39 molecules were conjugated to gold nanorod surface through PEG linker molecules to facilitate the cellular uptake 21 . Previous studies showed that CME plays a key role in cellular uptake of transferrin - coated gold nanospheres and nanorods of ~ 50 nm in size 40 . In the present study , we visualized the dynamic internalization of transferrin - coated gold nanorods by transfected A549 human lung cancer cells to express enhanced yellow ﬂ uorescent protein ( EYFP ) - tagged clathrin 41 . The co - localization of gold nanorods and ﬂ uorescent bright spots from EYFP - clathrin gives direct evidence that CME is involved in the internalization of transferrin - coated gold nanorods . Supplemen - tary Fig . 7 shows such a case where three out of eight transferrin - coated gold nanorods binding to the membrane of a transfected A549 cell display co - localized EYFP ﬂ uorescence after a 30 - min incubation in the cell culture medium containing the colloidal gold nanorods . In addition , we observed that the internalization of transferrin - coated gold nanorods was strongly dependent on the ambient temperature and osmotic pressure .

After the temperature was raised to 37 °C , over half of the nanorods initially spotted on the cell membrane were internalized within the ﬁ rst 2 h . In another control experiment , when the cells were treated with a hypertonic media ( Sucrose ) at 37 °C , signi ﬁ cant decreases in the uptake of the nanorods within the ﬁ rst 2 h were observed , compared to the nanorod uptake by the cells not treated with the hypertonic media ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . The temperature dependence and the response to the hypertonic treatment , which disrupts the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles , are consistent with the previous reports that CME is the key pathway for the cellular uptake of nanometer - sized particles 40 , 42 , 43 . Furthermore , speci ﬁ c mean to inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis was carried out by siRNA knockdown of AP - 2 µ 2 subunit in A549 cells . The siRNA oligonucleotide sequence 5 ′ - GAGCAUGUGCACGCUGGCCA - 3 ′ targeting μ 2 - 2 subunit of AP - 2 is highly effective to achieve nearly complete depletion of AP - 2 with two cycles of transfection , as reported by Motley et al . 44 and con ﬁ rmed by others 45 , 46 . The siRNA treatment was performed following the established protocol . As shown in Supplementary Fig . 9 , control cells showed much higher nanorod uptake compare to the cells subjected to AP - 2 depletion . In all the endocytosis 5D - SPT experiments , the parallax - DIC mode was activated intermittently ( every few seconds ) by inserting the wedge prism into the light path to compensate for focus drifting and keep the target gold nanorod in focus . During the remaining imaging time , the original DIC and ﬂ uorescence modes were operated alternately to acquire the orientation information of gold nanorods and the formation of ﬂ uorescent EYFP - clathrin coats . Rotational pattern before endocytosis . We followed the dynamic uptake of each transferrin - coated gold nanorod con - tinuously from its abrupt appearance on the cell membrane until the nanorod was linearly transported over long distances — con - vincing evidence of the nanorod being inside the cell . Unlike conventional SPT probes , gold nanorods are easy to identify , giving ﬂ ickering images due to their own fast rotation on the cell membrane . More importantly , the nanorods display characteristic rotational motions at different binding and endocytic stages . Figure 3 shows such an example of a complete process from the nanorod landing on the cell membrane to being endocytosed by an A549 cell . When the nanorod ﬁ rst fell on the cell membrane , it showed active lateral diffusion and fast rotation as revealed by the ﬂ uctuation of the DIC intensities ( e . g . , Fig . 3a – d and Supple - mentary Movies 2 and 3 ) . The rotational motions of gold nanorods can be correlated to the recorded DIC intensity changes as discussed in details in our previous publications based on the correlation of computer - simulated results and experimental data 20 , 23 . There are two fundamental rotation modes : the in - plane rotation in which the rotation axis falls in the focal plane and the nanorod rotates within the plane , and the out - of - plane rotation in which the rotation axis is perpendicular to the focal plane and the nanorod rotates out of the plane . Distinctive changing DIC image patterns are associated with these two modes , with a correlated bright and dark intensity changes for the in - plane rotation mode and an anti - correlated bright and dark intensity changes for the out - of - plane rotation mode . The motions of nanorod at the early stage of binding were characterized by active lateral diffusion in a relatively large area on the cell membrane ( e . g . , Fig . 3b , c and Supplementary Movie 2 ) and a random mix of the in - plane and out - of - plane rotation modes as revealed by the DIC intensity changing patterns . For example , during the framed period ( 472 . 7 – 473 . 2 s ) in Fig . 3c , the anti - correlated bright and dark intensity changes suggested that the nanorod likely swung around one of the polarization directions in an out - of - plane rotation mode . The nanorod gradually lost its translational and rotational freedoms on the cell membrane . The lateral movement quickly became restrained and came to a complete stop at 497 . 9 s . The rotational motion also became much slower , giving much less frequent ﬂ uctuations in the DIC intensities ( Fig . 3d and Supplementary Movie 3 ) . From the DIC intensities , we can identify that a component of in - plane rotation mode became more pronounced . For example , during the framed period ( 500 . 4 – 501 . 1 s ) in Fig . 3d , the nanorod ’ s DIC intensities changed in a correlation manner from completely dark to completely bright and then to completely dark again , showing a typical in - plane rotation mode . The gradual loss of translational and rotational freedoms and the increase of the in - plane rotation component were an indication of the assembling of the endocytic machinery around the gold nanorod . A transient in - plane rotation may be an indication that the nanorod is tethered to the cell membrane by multiple binding sites . However , this kind of multi - point binding is highly dynamic and can dissociate at the next few milliseconds as indicated by the disappearance of the in - plane rotation mode . Pearson ’ s correlation coef ﬁ cient analysis was applied to evaluate the rotational patterns . We have shown previously that for gold nanorod ’ s in - plane rotation , the DIC bright and dark intensities are highly correlated with a correlation coef ﬁ cient close to 1 , while for the out - of - plane rotation , the DIC bright and dark intensities are anti - correlated with a correlation coef ﬁ cient of − 1 23 . Supplementary Fig . 10 shows the correlation coef ﬁ cients of the DIC bright and dark intensities of 150 transferrin - coated gold nanorods at different stages of interacting with the cell membrane . For the nanorods having active lateral diffusion in a relatively large area at the early stage of binding on the cell membrane , the distribution of correlation coef ﬁ cient is centered at 0 . 48 with higher proportion of smaller correlation coef ﬁ cients . This indicates the nanorods have higher tendency of out - of - plane motions due to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged transferrin - coated gold nanorods and the negatively charged cell membrane . At the stage when gold nanorods lose their translational freedoms , the distribution of correlation coef ﬁ cient is centered at 0 . 65 . With speci ﬁ c binding to cell membrane receptors , gold nanorods perform predominantly in - plane rotation . The difference in the distributions of the correlation coef ﬁ cients at different binding stages is statistically signi ﬁ cant with a paired Student ’ s t - test ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Characteristic rotational motions during endocytosis . For all the nanorods that were eventually internalized , their fast rota - tional motions slowed down drastically at a certain point of time , an indication that the nanorods were enclosed in clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) . The nanorods then all experienced a relatively quiet period of several tens of seconds , during which the nanorods showed no active rotational diffusion but rather slow , directed orientation changes , mostly likely under the in ﬂ uence of endo - cytic protein machinery . At the end of the quiet period , the nanorods restored active rotational diffusion , indicating the nanorod - containing vesicles were detached from the membrane . This active rotation — quiet period — active rotation pattern was observed for all of the recorded ( > 100 ) endocytosis cases . In the case shown in Fig . 3 , the co - localization of the ﬂ uorescent CCP and the nanorod was observed at 530 . 8 s ( Fig . 3e ) . Then the nanorod stopped active rotational diffusion at ~ 536 . 5 s , followed ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 01001 - 9 6 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 887 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 01001 - 9 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications by a 20 - s quiet period ( Fig . 3f and Supplementary Movie 5 ) . During the quiet period , the nanorod displayed a nearly constant bright intensity but slow changes in the dark intensity from 542 to 553 . 7 s . At 553 . 7 s , the DIC image of the nanorod changed from completely dark to completely bright within only 2 – 3 frames ( less than 100 ms ) , indicating the nanorod suddenly restored active rotational diffusion . The translational motion of the vesicle followed at 559 . 9 s , showing a slow moving away from the original entry spot . At 570 . 2 s ( ~ 16 . 5 s after the detachment event ) , we observed that the clathrin coat already disassembled from the vesicle ( Supplementary Movie 6 ) . This nanorod - containing vesicle was continuously followed until it was actively transported inside the cell at ~ 599 . 4 s ( Supplementary Movie 7 ) . Intracellular transport in 3D cellular environments . Following the endocytosis , the endocytic vesicles can be transported intra - cellularly by motor proteins on the microtubules and actin ﬁ laments . Within the ﬁ rst ~ 45 min following the cellular uptake , the endocytosed substances mostly reside in early endosomes that are about 50 – 100 nm in diameter 47 , 48 . As discussed extensively in our previous publication 22 , the transferrin - coated gold nanorods are bound to the membrane receptors and tightly wrapped by the vesicle membranes . These nanorods generally lose the indepen - dent rotational freedoms relative to the vesicles ; therefore , they can be excellent reporters of translational and rotational motions of early endosomes being transported by motor proteins . In the present study , the 5D - SPT technique enabled us to reveal the full motions of nanorod - containing vesicles in living A549 cells with unprecedented accuracy . It should be noted that in order to track the movement in the z - axis , the automatic feedback control was always activated when studying intracellular transport . This was different from the intermittent activation when studying endocytosis , during which the nanorods were in or on the membrane with little vertical movement other than focus drift . One representative example is shown in Fig . 4 and Supple - mentary Movie 8 . The random but con ﬁ ned rotational motions of the cargo within the ﬁ rst second of the recording likely re ﬂ ect the process of the cargo searching for a cytoskeleton track . Starting at ~ 1 . 0 s , the cargo moved nearly straight along the z - axis for ~ 300 nm and returned at 2 . 1 s , suggesting a possible back - and - forth movement along a track that is perpendicular to the image plane . Then the cargo made a big turn during a pause lasting from 2 . 1 to 2 . 9 s , followed by lateral movement of over 5 µ m in the last 2 s of the recording . The big turn was likely due to the cargo switching from the perpendicular track to a horizontal one . The cargo also underwent a fast reversal ( going back and forth ) at 3 . 0 s , while the rotational behaviors of the nanorod could be observed , possibly because of the rearrangement of motors during which the tension on the cargo was weakened 22 . These observations combine to render the process of cargo transport inside a living cell with great details : cargo searching for a track , directional transport , track - switching , and pause . Three addi - tional examples are provided in Supplementary Figs . 11 – 13 and Supplementary Movies 9 – 12 . An interesting sequence of movement was observed at 3 . 6 – 5 . 0 s in Fig . 4 , when the cargo changed its moving direction laterally and vertically , accompanied by changes in its orientation . The sinusoidal - shaped vertical displacements were in the range of 0 1 2 3 4 Fast reversals – 1000 – 2000 – 3000 – 4000 – 2000 – 1000 0 200 100 0 – 100 – 200 200 100 0 – 100 – 200 – 3002000 1000 – 1000 – 4000 – 2000 2000 y ( n m ) x ( n m ) 0 0 1 . 15 1 . 10 D I C i n t en s i t y z ( n m ) z ( n m ) y ( n m ) x ( n m ) 1 . 05 1 . 00 0 . 95 0 . 90 0 1 2 3 4 5 Time ( s ) 5 μ m a b c Fig . 4 Intracellular transport of a nanorod - containing vesicle in a living A549 cell . a The time series of the x , y , and z displacement , relative DIC intensities and orientation angles of the gold nanorod .

Combined with the nearly linear lateral ( x and y ) trajectories , a likely explanation is that the cargo moves along the microtubule track with a twister - like motion . This phenomenon may be ascribed to microtubule bending ( a curved conformation of the tubulin dimers ) 49 , 50 . Although the steric hindrance induced by the crowded cellular environment is another plausible explanation , the smoothness of the 3D trajectory suggests a low probability of a completely random maneuver . This type of motion in live cells is not attainable with other SPT methods . Discussion The ﬁ ndings in the current study disclose characteristic rotational motions of nanorod cargos at different endocytic stages : active rotation , quiet period , and active rotation again with diffusion and transportation . Combining with the dynamic clathrin aggregation observed in ﬂ uorescence mode , this rotation - based model not only supports the current endocytosis models derived from the spatial and temporal organization of modular protein molecule groups 51 – 57 , but also provides new insights in the understanding of endocytosis progression . In the early phase of the modular model , the coating module — proteins involved in cargo recruitment and coat formation — forms on the membrane . This can be con ﬁ rmed in our ﬂ uorescence observations that clathrin assembles at this early stage . Further , the 5D - SPT tech - nique reveals that in this phase , the loss of translational freedom of the cargo does not coincide with the loss of rotational freedom . The nanorod kept rotating after apparent clathrin aggregation proves that the complete ﬁ xation of the cargo on the cell mem - brane happens after the initiation of the endocytosis process . The rotational motion eventually comes to a complete stop , which may be attributed to three factors : ( 1 ) the clathrin coat wrapping around the CCP to greatly reduce the ﬂ uidity of lipid membranes ; ( 2 ) the polymerization of actin ﬁ laments to anchor the CCP ; and ( 3 ) the polymerization of dynamin at the neck of the CCP to fully encapsulate the nanorod inside the CCP . Further con ﬁ rmation of the roles of actin and dynamin is currently underway . The 5D - SPT technique provides a unique opportunity to study the functions of different assisting proteins and how different coatings facilitate or inhibit endocytosis . On the other hand , we demonstrated the direct visualization of the full motions of the cargo in the 3D cellular environment during the intracellular transport . Future efforts along this line may provide new evidence to complete our understanding on the competition and coordination of kinesin and dynein motor proteins in live cells . Furthermore , a unique trait of the 5D - SPT technique is that the recorded moving traces re ﬂ ect the 3D organization of the cytoskeleton tracks inside the cell . Although the current set - up does not allow the visualization of the 3D structures of the cytoskeleton , it is promising that the 5D tracking of intracellular transport can be combined with super - resolution imaging of cytoskeleton structures 58 so that the transport mechanism of cargos can be better elucidated . Critical future steps are to combine the 5D - SPT of plasmonic nanoparticle probes with the ﬂ uorescence imaging of associated proteins , such as tau 59 – 61 and dynactin 62 , to understand the regulated intracellular transport at the molecular level . In summary , the parallax - DIC microscope and accompanying tracking program have been developed to realize automatic 5D - SPT in live cells . The axial movement of gold nanorod probe is detected by monitoring the distance between two half - plane images generated with a wedge prism . A vertical localization precision of 17 nm has been achieved . As demonstrated through the live cell SPT experiments , the 3D trajectories and DIC intensities incorporating rotational information of gold nanorod - containing vesicles can be correlated to elucidate different stages of the CME and the intracellular transport events in unprece - dented detail , which makes the 5D - SPT technique a promising tool to shed new light on the working mechanisms of molecular motors in live cells . Methods Imaging system . The Nikon Eclipse 80i upright microscope used in the present study supports DIC mode and epi ﬂ uorescence mode . The new parallax - DIC mode was enabled by adding a custom - cut wedge prism ( 0 . 5° wedge angle deviation , Edmund , Barrington , NJ ) ( Fig . 2 ) in the light path . When the microscope was operated in epi ﬂ uorescence mode , the sample was excited by a mercury lamp . When the microscope was operated in DIC mode , a set of Nomarski DIC optics ( including two Nomarski prisms , two polarizers , and a quarter - wave plate ) were used . A halogen lamp was used to illuminate the samples through an oil immersion condenser ( numerical aperture ( NA ) 1 . 40 ) and the optical signals were collected with a 100× Plan Apo VC NA 1 . 40 oil immersion objective . The DIC images at a selected wavelength were collected by inserting the corresponding bandpass ﬁ lter ( Semrock , Rochester , NY ) into the light path in the microscope . In parallax - DIC mode , the wedge prism set was placed at the back focal plane of the objective in the DIC con ﬁ guration . The addition of the wedge prism split the light in half , resulting in the formation of two half - plane images . Details of the implementation and evaluation of the 5D - SPT technique are presented in the Supplementary Note 1 . A Photometrics Evolve 512 EMCCD camera was used for image and video recordings . A rotary motor from Sigma Koki ( model no . SGSP - 60YAM ) was coupled to the microscope stage to control the z - position of the sample . A heating stage was used when necessary . The 5D - SPT technique was implanted by compiling the correlation mapping and z calibration into a NIH ImageJ / µ Manager 63 , 64 plugin using Java . MATLAB and NIH ImageJ were used to analyze the collected images and videos . Preparation of transferrin - coated gold naonrods . Gold nanorods used in the experiments were all obtained from Nanopartz ( Salt Lake City , UT ) . The purchased gold nanorods were stabilized in cetyltrimethylammonium bromide solution . Gold nanorods with aspect ratio range from 1 . 36 to 3 were tested and the optimal sizes were used for the experiments as speci ﬁ ed . To functionalize the surface of gold nanorods with transferrin ( CAS : 11096 - 37 - 0 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , a N - hydro - xylsuccinimide polyethylene glycol thiol ( NHS - PEG - thiol ) linker ( CAS : 947601 - 98 - 1 , Sigma - Aldrich ) was used by following a published protocol 65 . The NHS - PEG - thiol linker has both disul ﬁ de and succinimidyl functionalities for chemisorption onto gold and covalent coupling of transferrin and / or other proteins . As for the gold nanorods , excessive surfactant was ﬁ rst removed from 1 . 0 mL gold nanorod solution by centrifugation at 2000× g for 10min and resuspended in 18 . 2M Ω Milli - Q water . The freshly prepared gold nanorod solution was then mixed with 10 µ L 20 - mM NHS - PEG - thiol solution ( in dimethyl sulfoxide ) and reacted for 1 . 5h . After that , the solution was centrifuged at 2000× g for 10min and resuspended in Milli - Q water to remove excess NHS - PEG - thiol . An aliquot of 20 µ L of 2mg ml − 1 transferrin in phosphate buffer saline ( PBS , pH 7 . 4 ) was added to the gold nanorod solution and reacted for 3 h . The transferrin - coated gold nanorods were then centrifuged at 2000× g for 10min and resuspended in Milli - Q water before use . Cell culture for live cell imaging . A549 human lung cancer cells ( CCL - 185 , ATCC ) were plated in a T25 cell culture ﬂ ask ( Corning , NY ) and grown in complete cell culture medium containing F - 12K medium ( 30 - 2004 , ATCC ) and 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , 30 - 2020 , ATCC ) in a cell culture incubator ( 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 ) . An appropriate amount of cell suspension solution was subcultured onto a 22 ×22 mm poly - L - lysine ( PLL ) - coated coverslip , housed in a 35 - mm Petri dish ( Corning , NY ) and kept in the cell culture incubator for 1 h to allow the cells to attach to the coverslip . After that , 1 . 5mL complete cell culture medium was added to immerse the coverslip . The cells were ready for use when the cell culture reached about 70 % con ﬂ uency . Two pieces of double - sided tape served as spacers were attached on top of a pre - cleaned glass slide . A coverslip with cells was placed on top of the tapes with two edges to form a chamber , with the cell side facing the glass slide . The two open sides of the chamber were sealed by nail polish to prevent evaporation . The sandwiched chamber was made right before imaging . Transfection of A549 cell to express clathrin - LCa - EYFP . E . Coli bacteria with clathrin - LCa - EYFP plasmid was acquired from Addgene ( Plasmid 21741 , Cambridge , MA ) 41 . The plasmid was extracted from the bacteria by using plasmid extraction kit ( cat . 27104 ) and the corresponding protocol from QIAGEN ( Valencia , CA ) . The A549 cells were pre - grown on coverslip in a Petri dish for 24 h in the incubator . The EYFP - clathrin plasmid was mixed with the transfection reagent ( FuGene6 , Roche Applied Science , Indianapolis , IN ) in serum - free cell ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 01001 - 9 8 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 887 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 01001 - 9 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications culture media ﬁ rst and introduced into the Petri dish containing the cells . After additional 24 – 48h incubation , the cells were ready to use . In control experiments , the cells were incubated with hypertonic media ( 0 . 45 M Sucrose ) or clathrin coat disruption drug ( 10 µ g ml − 1 Chlorpromazine Chloride ) at 37 °C before exposure to the surface - modi ﬁ ed gold nanorods . siRNA knockdown . The siRNA oligonucleotide sequence 5 ′ - GAGCAUGUGCAC GCUGGCCA - 3 ′ targeting μ 2 - 2 and the control siRNA oligonucleotide sequence 5 ′ - AACACAGCAACCUCUACUUGG - 3 ′ were both purchased from Dharmacon , Inc . through custom synthesis option . The siRNA knockdown was performed by using oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) following the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Brie ﬂ y , A549 cells were plated onto 35 - mm Petri dishes 1 day before transfection in growth medium without antibiotics so that cells would be 30 – 50 % con ﬂ uent at the time of transfection . For each dish , 3 μ L oligofectamine was diluted and mixed gently by pipetting up and down in Opti - MEM ® I Medium ( Life Technologies ) to a ﬁ nal volume 15 μ L and incubated for 10 min at room temperature , while 5 µ L of a 20 µ M stock oligonucleotide ( 10 nmol synthetic siRNA in 500 µ L of 1× siRNA buffer ) was diluted and mixed gently in Opti - MEM ® I Medium to a total volume of 185 µ L . Then the two solutions were mixed gently and incubated at room tem - perature for 30 min . This mixture was then combined with 800 µ L of Opti - MEM ® I Medium and added to the cells after washing once with Opti - MEM ® I Medium . The ﬁ nal concentration of siRNA was 100 nM . An aliquot of 500 µ L of growth medium without antibiotics was added after incubating the cells with the trans - fection mixture in the cell incubator for 4h . The cells were kept in the incubator until they were trypsinized the next day . Second transfection was then performed following the same protocol as described above 1 day after replating . Cells were trypsinized 48h after the second transfection , replated on 22× 22 mm coverslips and allowed to grow one additional day for DIC microscopy experiments . Disruption of AP - 2 - dependant endocytosis of transferrin - coated gold nanorods after siRNA treatment were assessed by DIC microscopy . Cells were transfected and treated as described above . An aliquot of 25 µ L of 0 . 05nM transferrin - coated gold nanorod ( 40 × 80nm ) solution was mixed into 1mL serum - free medium and added to the cells after washing cells with 1× PBS and incubated at 37 °C in the cell incubator for 30 min . The cells were then washed three cycles with cold 1× PBS and ﬁ xed for 10min at room temperature in freshly prepared formaldehyde solution containing 3 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde , followed by three cycles of 10 - min washing with 1× PBS on a shaker . The uptake of gold nanorod was visualized under a DIC microscope at different wavelengths and z - stacks were acquired using the objective scanner and reconstructed in Amira , a 3D visualization and analysis program .
