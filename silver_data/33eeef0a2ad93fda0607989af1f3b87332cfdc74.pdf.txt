( 1234567890 ) Introduction Liver fibrosis is the excessive accumulation of extra - cellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins in the liver and is caused by various liver diseases , such as nonalco - holic fatty liver disease , alcoholic liver disease , and viral hepatitis ( Aydin and Akcali 2018 ; Estes et al . 2018 ; Younossi et al . 2018 ) . Liver fibrosis is a revers - ible wound - healing response ; even in the late stages of cholestasis and viral hepatitis , liver function can recover if risk factors are removed . However , when liver fibrosis has progressed to cirrhosis , the abnor - mally remodeled blood vessels and liver cells are replaced by scar tissue , which indicates that it is dif - ficult to recover liver function ( Okada et al . 2017 ; Kong et al . 2019 ) . Hepatic fibrosis is a common path - ological process in the development of chronic liver diseases that could progress to cirrhosis . Therefore , reversing hepatic fibrosis in chronic liver disease is an important strategy for preventing cirrhosis . A previous study reported that hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) are important effector cells in liver fibrosis since they are the main source of ECM , which plays a key role in the development of liver fibrosis . HSCs are located in Disse’s space , between hepatic sinusoi - dal endothelial cells and hepatic cells . Inactive HSCs play a primary role in the regulation of vitamin A metabolism and hepatic sinus blood flow in normal liver tissue ( Higashi et al . 2017 ) . However , HSCs become activated and transform into a proliferative myofibroblast ( MFB ) with increased contractility and up - regulated α - smooth actin ( α - SMA ) levels ( Gress - ner 1996 ) when stimulated by certain physical factors , chemical factors , or microbial infections ( Wallace et al . 2015 ; Koyama and Brenner 2017 ) . Activated HSCs secrete collagen continuously and promote the abnormal accumulation of ECM , ultimately leading to liver fibrosis . In summary , activation of HSCs leads to increased cell proliferation and collagen synthesis , which is considered to be the major pathological pro - cess of liver fibrosis ( Tsuchida and Friedman 2017 ) . Therefore , inhibition of HSC activation is viewed as one of the main therapeutic strategies for blocking the progression of liver fibrosis . The active ingredients of Sophora flavescens Ait . include matrine and oxymatrine . An increasing number of studies have revealed the pharmacologi - cal effects of matrine , including anti - inflammatory , immunosuppressive , anti - tumor , and anti - fibrotic effects . It has been used clinically to treat certain acute and chronic liver diseases ( Zhang et al . 2001a , 2011 ; Wang et al . 2012 ; Liu et al . 2014 ) . Oxymatrine has been demonstrated to have protective effects in an acute liver injury model in mice and a liver fibrosis model in rats ( Zhang et al . 2001a , b ) . However , the protective effect was weak , which may be due to a short half - life ( t 1 / 2 = 0 . 5 h ) ( Yang et al . 2014 ) . In this study , we modified the structure of matrine to obtain a novel matrine derivative , WM130 ( Fig . 1A ) . Our previous results have shown that WM130 is struc - turally stable and has high pharmacological activ - ity , which includes inhibiting the activity of HSC - T6 cells , thereby inhibiting the progression of liver fibro - sis in rats ( Xu et al . 2015 ) . This study aimed to fur - ther explore the anti - fibrotic effects of WM130 on a human HSC cell line , LX - 2 , and determining its tar - get and mechanism of action . This study may provide a theoretical basis for further work using WM130 . Materials and methods Cell lines and cell culture The human stellate cell line , LX - 2 , was obtained from Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medi - cine . The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modi - fied Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ; GIBCO , New York , USA ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; GIBCO , New York , USA ) , 100 g / ml strepto - mycin , and 100 U / ml penicillin . They were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 . LX - 2 cells have been known to retain virtually all features of activated HSCs . Cell counting kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 ) assay and IC 50 detection LX - 2 cells ( 5 × 10 3 ) were plated into 96 - well plates overnight and treated with different concentrations of WM130 ( 0 – 100 μg / ml ) for 24 h . After adding 10 μl CCK - 8 ( Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology , Haimen , China ) , cells were incubated for 2 h and OD was measured at 450 nm . The IC 50 was determined using the trimmed Spearman - Karber method ( Hamil - ton et al . 1977 ) . Each concentration was repeated five times . 615 Cytotechnology ( 2022 ) 74 : 613 – 622 1 3 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) Wound healing assay LX - 2 cells ( 2 × 10 5 ) were plated into 6 - well plates . When 80 % confluency was reached , the plates were scratched with a tip , washed using PBS , and incu - bated overnight with 30 μg / ml matrine or WM130 , which is one - half of the IC 50 . An untreated group was set up as a control . All groups were photographed at 0 and 24 h . Migration distance was determined using Adobe Photoshop ver . 3 . 0 . Transwell assay LX - 2 cells at 1 × 10 6 cells / ml were seeded ( 200 μl ) into the upper chambers of 24 - well transwell plates ( 8 . 0 μm pore size ; Corning , NY , USA ) and the cells were treated with 30 μg / ml matrine or WM130 . An untreated control group was also set up . The bottom chamber contained 500 μl media with 20 % FBS and the cells were incubated for 24 h to allow for migra - tion . The cells in the bottom chamber were fixed with 1 % paraformaldehyde and stained by crystal violet for 15 min , washed with PBS , and the number of migrated cells was determined using a microscope . 3D mimic study for the binding of WM130 to cofilin 1 WM130 resin was synthesized ( SupFig . 1 ) . The total protein from the LX - 2 cells was used as the mobile phase and the protein adsorbed on the WM130 resin was collected . The proteins that were bound to WM130 were separated by SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) . The amino acid sequence of the WM130 target protein from the LX - 2 cells was identified using the MALDI - TOF / TOF mass spectrometry method . All the molecular modeling calculations were performed using SYBYL 6 . 9 ver - sion ( Tripos International , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . And the structures of the compounds were assigned with Gasteiger – Hückle partial atomic charges . Energy minimization was performed using the Tripos force field , Powell optimization method , and MAXIMIN2 mini - mizer with a convergence criterion 0 . 001 kcal / mol Å . Simulated annealing was then performed . Fig . 1 WM130 inhibits the proliferation and activation of LX - 2 cells .

( 1234567890 ) The system was heated to 1000 K for 1 . 0 ps and then annealed to 250 K for 1 . 5 ps . The annealing function was exponential ; 50 such cycles of annealing were run and the resulting 50 conformers were optimized using methods described above . The lowest energy conformation was selected . All the other parameters were default value . The structure of WM130 was drawn by Chemdraw software , and the protein struc - ture of cofilin 1 was found in the protein data bank . The binding of cofilin 1 protein to compound WM130 was simulated with software Discovery Studio 3 . 5 . The binding region and possible binding sites were determined by the size of binding free energy . Immunofluorescent colocalization assay WM130 - Biotin was constructed ( SupFig . 3 ) . Then , 5 × 10 4 LX - 2 cells were seeded on a cover slip and after an overnight growth . Treated with WM130 - Bio - tin , the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at temperature and permeabilized with PBS - Triton X - 100 for 20 min . Wash the cells three times with PBS + 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( PBST ) and block in PBST containing 10 % goat serum and 5 % BSA for 1 h at 37 °C . After three washes , incubate cells for 1 h at 37 °C with anti - cofilin 1 antibody ( Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA ) diluted in blocking solu - tion containing 2 % Triton X - 100 ( 1 : 200 ) .

Results WM130 inhibits the proliferation and activation of LX - 2 cells WM130 strongly inhibited the proliferation of LX - 2 cells in a concentration - dependent manner ( Fig . 1B ) , 617 Cytotechnology ( 2022 ) 74 : 613 – 622 1 3 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) with an IC 50 of 60 μg / ml . WM130 at 30 μg / ml was used as a working concentration in further experi - ments . Activated LX - 2 cells can express a large amount of α - SMA and ECM , leading to excessive accumulation of ECM . However , 30 μg / ml of matrine or WM130 can reduce α - SMA levels in LX - 2 cells ( Fig . 1C ) , with WM130 being more effective . These results indicated that WM130 significantly inhibits the activation of LX - 2 cells . WM130 inhibits the migration of LX - 2 cells To examine the effects of WM130 on the migration of LX - 2 cells , we used a scratch test and found that the migration distance of LX - 2 was significantly reduced after pretreatment with matrine or WM130 ( Fig . 2A ) , with WM130 having a stronger effect . These results indicated that WM130 could inhibit the migration of LX - 2 . A transwell assay confirmed the results ; the number of migrated cells after WM130 treatment was significantly lower ( Fig . 2C ) . Our adhesion assay data revealed that WM130 could significantly reduce the adhesion of LX - 2 cells to collagen I , fibronectin , and laminin which are the major components of the ECM ( SupFig . 3 ) . WM130 acts on LX - 2 cells via cofilin 1 The whole protein in the cells acts as a mobile phase and binds to the WM130 resin ( The synthesized WM130 resin is shown in SupFig . 1 ) , during the interaction between WM130 and LX - 2 cells .

( 1234567890 ) A protein was identified in the WM130 - bound sam - ple and the amino acid sequence was analyzed by MALDI - TOF / TOF mass spectrometry . However , the protein was identified as cofilin 1 ( SupTab . 1 ) and this identification was confirmed by the cofilin 1 ( 19kd ) monoclone antibody ( Fig . 3A ) . Immuno - fluorescent colocalization in LX - 2 cells revealed that WM130 - Biotin ( SupFig . 2 ) colocalized with cofi - lin 1 ( Fig . 3B ) , and the above experiment confirmed that the target of WM130 in LX - 2 cells is cofilin 1 . Next , we are working on using simulation techniques to identify therapeutic target protein . The protein of cofilin 1 that combine with WM130 tightly can be screened from the proteins’ library . We noted the binding site was disappeared after Ser3 mutation when using computer to simulate the free energy of the mutant binding to WM130 , which suggested WM130 bind with cofilin 1 in the cells , and the muta - tion of ser3 has a great influence on the whole bind - ing region ( Fig . 3C ) . Fig . 3 The target of WM130 in LX - 2 cells is cofilin 1 . A SDS - PAGE to detect proteins absorbed by the resin and western blot analysis confirmed that the protein is cofilin 1 ; B Immunofluorescent colocalization confirmed that cofilin 1 is the target of WM130 in LX - 2 cells ; C The binding of cofilin 1 to WM130 was simulated with software Discovery Studio 3 . 5 . However , the binding site between WM130 and cofilin 1 was Ser3 619 Cytotechnology ( 2022 ) 74 : 613 – 622 1 3 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) WM130 down - regulates cofilin 1 and filamentous actin ( F - actin ) protein , and inhibits the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway Research shows that block the PI3K and Akt sig - nals involved in hepatic stellate cells proliferation ( Riaz et al . 2021 ) . After treatment of LX - 2 cells with WM130 , cofilin 1 , p - cofilin 1 , F - actin , PI3K , p - Akt , Akt , and PTEN were detected . The expression of cofilin 1 , F - actin , PI3K and p - Akt were significantly down - regulated , while the levels of PTEN protein were significantly increased ( Fig . 4 ) . This suggests that the effects of WM130 on LX - 2 cell activity may be achieved by down - regulating the expression of Fig . 4 WM130 down - regulates cofilin 1 and F - actin proteins in LX - 2 cells and inhibits the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway .

Discussion Matrine is one of the active ingredients of the tra - ditional Chinese medicine S . flavescens . Numerous studies have identified its regulatory actions , which include anti - inflammatory , immune regulation , anti - tumor , and anti - fibrotic effects ( Liu et al . 2014 , 2015 ; Yu et al . 2014 ; Zhang et al . 2015 ) . Although the pharmacological action of matrine is quite exten - sive , it has low activity levels . Therefore , an effec - tive method was developed to structurally modify matrine to obtain a highly active , nontoxic derivative . We used a similar structure to modify matrine , with sophoridine as the parent nucleus . Studies have con - firmed that the carbonyl group is the pharmacophore for matrine , and a series of thio - matrine compounds have been synthesized by addition of a thio group and a side - chain using the Michael addition method . In this process , WM130 and its maleate are obtained , producing a stable , highly active new matrine deriva - tive . Our previous study ( Xu et al . 2015 ) have found that HSCs are very sensitive to WM130 , and their ability to proliferate is greatly impaired . The IC 50 of the experimental cells is 68 μM . At concentrations of 34 μM and 68 μM , WM130 can significantly reduce α - SMA protein levels and induce apoptosis in HSC - T6 cells . In vivo experiments show that WM130 can effectively reduce the expression levels of TGF - β1 and α - SMA in fibrotic rat liver tissue . WM130 can also reduce collagen fiber formation and inhibit the progression of liver fibrosis in rats . However , the role of WM130 in human hepatic stellate cells is still unknown . The aim of the present study was to iden - tify new targets and treatments for liver fibrosis . The CCK - 8 assay was used to detect the effects of WM130 on the proliferation of LX - 2 cells . It was found that WM130 inhibits the proliferation of LX - 2 cells , and the half - inhibitory concentration ( IC 50 ) of WM130 on LX - 2 cells was calculated as 60 μg / ml . Therefore , we used half of the IC 50 ( 30 μg / ml ) of WM130 as the working concentration of WM130 or matrine on LX - 2 cells . And the toxicity assay of WM130 was determined on normal liver cells WRL - 68 in our previous study , IC50 of WM130 was 116 . 4 μM ( about 68 μg / ml ) , which was much higher than the doses of 30 μg / ml used in vitro . So we think it is non - toxic at the concentration of 30 μg / ml of WM130 in vitro . Studies on liver fibrosis mechanisms suggest that HSCs activation is the core process for liver fibrosis . After activation , HSCs are transformed into myofibroblasts , which begin to produce α - SMA and secrete a large amount of ECM , forming scar tis - sue , and promoting the progression of liver fibrosis . Our experiments showed that WM130 significantly reduced α - SMA levels in LX - 2 cells , indicating that WM130 can inhibit LX - 2 cell activation . Scratch and transwell migration assays showed that WM130 inhibited LX - 2 cell migration to a higher degree than matrine at the same concentration . The human cofilin 1 gene ( CFL 1 ) , which is located at 11q13 , encodes a non - muscle tissue protein and is widely expressed in non - muscle tissues , especially in the brain and liver . Cofilin 1 binds actin and plays an important regulatory role in the depolymerization and polymerization of actin during cytoskeletal reorgani - zation ( Gressin et al . 2015 ; Wang et al . 2015 ) . Cofilin 1 can sever F - actin , which is an important regulator of actin kinetics during cell migration . Cofilin 1 regu - lates actin recombination in normal cells , but under stressful conditions it binds to F - actin and utilizes F - actin’s instability to promote F - actin depolymeriza - tion ( Schlau et al . 2018 ) . Phosphorylation of Ser - 3 , a unique phosphorylation site in cofilin 1 , causes cofilin 1 to lose the ability to bind F - actin , thereby enhanc - ing the stability of F - actin ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) . At present , most research on cofilin 1 has focused on its role in tumors . The activation of cofilin 1 was con - sidered to be related to the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells ( Virtanen et al . 2018 ) . In addition , there is a dynamic balance between cofilin 1 and p - cofilin 1 in tumor cells , which plays an important role in the precise movement of cells , the regulation of cell and exogenous matrix adhesion , the nuclear division of cells , and the speed and depth of cell invasion . Local activation of cofilin 1 induces the formation of lamel - lipodia , which are rich in actin , the contractile force of which help move the cell forward ( Han et al . 2007 ; Tahtamouni et al . 2013 ; Mousavi et al . 2018 ) . Our study identified cofilin 1 as the target of WM130 , and the binding site between WM130 and cofilin 1 was Ser3 . Cofilin 1 and F - actin protein levels were signifi - cantly lower with WM130 treatment , indicating that the effects in LX - 2 cells may be achieved by down - regulating these proteins . We suspect that the binding 621 Cytotechnology ( 2022 ) 74 : 613 – 622 1 3 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) of WM130 to cofilin 1 may affect the phosphoryla - tion of cofilin 1 and the interaction of cofilin 1 with F - actin . The results of adhesion assay suggested that WM130 could affect cytoskeleton reorganization of LX - 2 cells , which collate with the interaction between WM130 and cofilin 1 / F - actin . The latest research confirms that hypoxia - induced cofilin 1 increases the proliferation , migration , invasion , and EMT in hepa - tocellular carcinoma by regulating the AKT pathway ( Yao et al . 2021 ) . BMP9 counteracts the tumorigenic and pro - angiogenic potential of glioblastoma by inhibiting the PI3K / AKT / MAPK and RhoA / Cofi - lin pathway ( Porcù et al . 2018 ) . These indicated that there are crosstalk between AKT pathway and cofi - lin 1 . Then , WM130 downregulates the expression of cofilin 1 and F - actin not only at the protein but also at the mRNA level , possibly related to WM130 regu - lating AKT signaling pathway . However , we observed that the expression of cofilin 1 was difference in the stage of liver fibrosis . These might suggest that cofilin 1 played an important role on the progression from liver fibrosis to hepatocellular carcinoma . Phosphadylinositol - 3 - OH - kinase ( PI3K ) is an esterase that can be activated by cytokines and growth factors , which can bind the substrate 3 , 4 - diphospholipid on the cell membrane . Phosphati - dylinositol - 3 , 4 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) is converted to 3 , 4 , 5 - bisphosphoinositol ( Phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - bisphosphate , PIP3 ) , which is the main mediator of PI3K’s biological effects , leading to activation of the downstream Akt signaling pathway ( Ma et al . 2017 ) . The PI3K / Akt pathway is considered to be the main signaling pathway for protein synthesis and plays an important role in regulating cell growth , proliferation , differentiation , and metastasis . The PTEN gene was originally thought to be a tumor suppressor gene with a dual - specificity phosphatase function . Based on the deeper understanding gained from recent research , PTEN is currently considered to be a negative regula - tor of protein kinase B ( Akt ) ( Li et al . 2018 ) . PTEN mainly inhibits Akt activity by dephosphorylation of the PIP3 molecule to form PIP2 , which blocks the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway ( Zhang et al . 2018 ) . Our study found that WM130 down - regulated PI3K and p - Akt protein levels in LX - 2 cells while up - regulating the protein level of PTEN . This result suggests that the inhibitory effects of WM130 on LX - 2 cells may be related to the activity of the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway . In summary , the novel matrine derivative WM130 significantly inhibits the proliferation , activation , and migration of LX - 2 cells . WM130 may down - regulate cofilin 1 and F - actin protein levels by targeting cofi - lin 1 , which causes inhibition of LX - 2 cell migration . Moreover , WM130 may regulate the proliferation and activation of LX - 2 cells by inhibiting the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway . Acknowledgements Not applicable .
