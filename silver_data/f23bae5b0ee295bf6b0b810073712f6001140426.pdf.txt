Proteins that perform these functions include Vipp1 / IM30 in photosynthetic plastids , PspA in bacteria , CdvB in TACK archaea and ESCRT - III in eukaryotes . Here , we show that these protein families are homologous and share a common evolutionary origin . Using cryo - electron microscopy we present structures for Vipp1 rings over a range of symmetries . Each ring is built from rungs that stack and spontaneously self - organise to form domes . Rungs are assembled from a polymer that is strikingly similar in structure to ESCRT - III . A tilt between rungs generates the dome - shaped curvature with constricted open ends and an inner membrane - binding lumen . Overall , our results reveal conserved mechanistic principles that underlie Vipp1 , PspA and ESCRT - III dependent membrane remodelling across all domains of life . One sentence summary : Evolutionary and structural analyses of Vipp1 / IM30 rings reveal ESCRT - III - like polymers that remodel membranes in bacteria . 3 Main text : Various cytoskeletal elements , filaments and membrane remodelling systems that were once viewed as the defining features of eukaryotic cells are now known to have a prokaryotic ancestry . Bacteria and some archaea have their own versions of tubulin ( FtsZ ) , actin ( MreB , FtsA and ParM ) , intermediate filaments ( Crescentin ) , and dynamins ( BDLPs ) ( 1 - 3 ) . These proteins perform functions in prokaryotes that are often analogous to their eukaryotic counterparts including cell division , cell shape control and membrane remodelling . In contrast , homologues of ESCRT - III proteins , another conserved and important superfamily of membrane remodelling proteins in eukaryotes , which perform diverse functions in multivesicular body formation , cytokinetic abscission , plasma membrane repair , nuclear envelope reformation and viral budding ( 4 ) , have yet to be found in bacteria . The recent identification of ESCRT - III homologues in TACK ( 5 , 6 ) and Asgard ( 7 ) archaea where they have been proposed to perform important roles in viral budding , exosome formation and cell division suggested that these eukaryotic signature proteins likely have an archaeal origin . PspA , Vipp1 and ESCRT - III are close evolutionary relatives To identify other as yet unknown ESCRT - III relatives , we used sensitive protein sequence searches based on Hidden Markov Models ( 8 ) . Using eukaryotic ESCRT - III proteins as search queries , PspA and Vipp1 / IM30 families were identified as bacterial ESCRT - III homologues ( materials and methods and fig . S1A ) . This was intriguing as PspA functions in the bacterial membrane stress response and in membrane repair ( 9 ) , whilst Vipp1 in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts functions in thylakoid biogenesis and membrane repair ( 10 ) through poorly understood mechanisms . These roles are consistent with some of the reported ESCRT - III functions in eukaryotes ( 11 ) . Both PspA and Vipp1 bind membrane and self - assemble to form 4 rings and cage - like scaffolds ( 12 , 13 ) . How polymerisation is regulated and coupled to membrane repair in these systems remains a key question . In addition to their similarity in primary sequence , PspA , Vipp1 and ESCRT - III families were also found to share similar secondary structure predictions with each containing six helices , termed helix a 0 - a 5 . An additional C - terminal extension that includes helix a 6 is also often present in members of PspA / Vipp1 and ESCRT - III family proteins ( Fig . 1A and fig . S1A ) . Using a co - evolutionary analysis to identify tertiary structural features of the proteins ( 14 , 15 ) , we identified high scoring residues that co - vary in PspA / Vipp1 evolution within a key conserved ESCRT - III interface that forms between helix a 5 and helices a 1 and a 2 ( Fig . 1B ) . This interaction functions to maintain ESCRT - III in its auto - inhibited closed monomeric conformation ( 16 ) and undergoes a helix a 5 domain swap between subunits to switch the ESCRT - III monomer to an open conformation during polymer assembly ( 17 ) . Overall , a co - evolutionary model of Vipp1 structure based on residue - residue distance constraints was congruent with the known structure of ESCRT - III CHMP3 ( Fig . 1B ) . An analysis mapping the presence or absence of these proteins within bacteria and archaea revealed that PspA / Vipp1 is distributed across bacteria ( Fig . 1C ) - where ESCRT - III homologues appear completely absent . Conversely , ESCRT - III homologues clustered amongst the archaea within Asgard and TACK superphyla ( 7 ) ( Fig . 1C ) . In addition , PspA / Vipp1 homologues were found within the euryarchaeata ( including in Haloarchaea and Methanosarcinia ) where they appeared to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria ( Fig . 1C and 1D ) . A broader phylogenetic analysis of the PspA , Vipp1 and ESCRT - III superfamily as a whole revealed a long branch separating ESCRT - III and PspA / Vipp1 clades , indicating a divergence between these two subfamilies early in the evolutionary history of life ( Fig . 1D and fig . S1B ) . As the long branch at the centre of the phylogeny corresponds to the basal divergence between archaea and bacteria , and the archaeal pspA genes were likely acquired from bacteria , the tree is 5 consistent with the hypothesis that the divergence between PspA and ESCRT - III occurred in the last universal common ancestor ( LUCA ) . This analysis also confirmed that Vipp1 likely arose from a pspA gene duplication ( 18 ) and is found widely distributed amongst the cyanobacteria and plants , often with multiple copies . Some cyanobacteria also have PspA with a likely function in cell membrane repair rather than thylakoid membrane maintenance as for Vipp1 ( 10 ) . In order to further develop our evolutionary analyses , and to probe PspA / Vipp1 function and mechanism , structural studies were undertaken focussed on Vipp1 . Vipp1 purification and cryo - electron microscopy Full - length Vipp1 / IM30 ( amino acids 1 - 258 , 28 . 7 kDa ) from Nostoc punctiforme was expressed in Escherichia coli as a C - terminal maltose - binding protein ( MBP ) fusion . MBP - Vipp1 was purified by amylose affinity chromatography and then separated from MBP by TEV cleavage and size exclusion chromatography . The purified protein was analysed by SDS - PAGE ( fig . S2A ) and its identity confirmed by LC - MS analysis . Negative stain ( NS ) electron microscopy ( EM ) analysis of Vipp1 revealed a remarkable array of polymeric assemblies , including rings , ring stacks , filaments , and ribbons reminiscent of Vipp1 in other systems ( fig . S2B ) ( 12 , 19 - 21 ) . In order to determine the architecture of the Vipp1 rings , the sample was flash frozen on holey carbon grids for cryo - electron microscopy analysis . Micrographs of Vipp1 in thin vitreous ice revealed preferential orientation bias with an absence of essential side views . In order to promote side view orientation , we mixed pre - formed rat Dynamin 1 filaments with Vipp1 before vitrification . These filaments have a 37 nm diameter and appear equivalent to the human Dynamin 1 super - constricted state ( 22 ) . The resultant network of Dynamin 1 filaments on the grid helped maintain a sufficiently thick ice layer around the Vipp1 particles so that orientation bias was reduced and side views captured ( fig . S2C - D ) . 2D class 6 averages revealed a spectrum of seven ring symmetries ranging from C11 to C17 with symmetries C13 , C14 and C15 the most populous ( fig . S2E ) . The Vipp1 monomer has an ESCRT - III - like fold Reconstruction of the C14 symmetry ring ( Vipp1 C14 ) achieved an overall resolution of 6 . 5 Å with highest resolution regions reaching 4 . 8 Å in the central rungs 3 - 5 ( fig . S3 and S4A , Table S1 ) . This resolution was sufficient to allow unambiguous main chain model building of the Vipp1 monomer and asymmetric unit , and consequently the entire 2 . 4 MDa Vipp1 C14 ring containing 84 subunits ( Fig . 2 , materials and methods and fig . S4B - D ) . To build the Vipp1 C14 monomer , a homology model was initially generated from the PspA crystal structure hairpin motif ( aa 24 - 142 ) . For these amino acids , PspA and Vipp1 share 32 . 5 % sequence identity and 58 % similarity with zero gaps , which indicates a conserved sequence register in this section ( fig . S4E and fig . S5 ) . The Vipp1 hairpin homology model with its distinct axial twist closely fitted the Vipp1 C14 map and acted as an anchor from which to build the remaining main chain . Reconstructions were also generated for the other six symmetries and complete ring models built . Sizes ranged from the 1 . 6 MDa Vipp1 C11 ring with 55 subunits to the 3 . 4 MDa Vipp1 C17 ring with 119 subunits . In order to validate these Vipp1 C11 - C17 structures , the accuracy of the sequence register within the Vipp1 monomer was tested by a cysteine cross - linking assay ( fig . S6A ) . L86C and L193C were chosen for mutation ( Vipp1 L86C / L193C ) as they are located at opposing ends of the Vipp1 subunit within the hairpin tip and helix a 5 , respectively . Our Vipp1 C11 - C17 structures position these residues at an inter - subunit contact with the cysteine sulphur atoms predicted ~ 6 Å apart . In the presence of the oxidising agent ortho - Cu ( II ) - phenanthroline ( CuP ) or the cross - linker MTS4 with a 7 . 8 Å span , clear band shifts were observed for Vipp1 L86C / L193C consistent with Vipp1 dimers , trimers , tetramers and higher molecular weight polymers . The subsequent 7 addition of DTT abolished these band shifts due to reduction of the reversible disulphide bond . No equivalent band shifts were observed for the single cysteine mutants Vipp1 L86C or Vipp1 L193C . Overall , this indicates that the Vipp1 L86C / L193C band shifts represented specific close cross - links connecting L86C and L193C as predicted by the Vipp1 C11 - C17 structures . In order to compare the structure of Vipp1 with the structure of the ESCRT - III protein CHMP1B , we followed the ESCRT - III nomenclature ( fig . S5 ) ( 17 ) . The hairpin motif , which is formed by helix a 1 and conjoined helices a 2 / a 3 , was observed to be a conserved hallmark of Vipp1 , PspA and ESCRT - III proteins ( Fig . 3A ) . In addition , helix a 4 was separated from hairpin helices a 2 / a 3 by a linker region that corresponded to the ‘elbow’ in CHMP1B ( 17 ) . Helix a 5 was then angled at near right angles from helix a 4 in both Vipp1 and ESCRT - III proteins . In addition to these core common helices a 1 - a 5 between Vipp1 and CHMP1B ( 17 , 23 ) , the Vipp1 monomer includes an N - terminal helix a 0 ( aa 1 - 22 ) that extends perpendicular to the hairpin and mediates membrane binding in both PspA and Vipp1 systems ( 24 - 27 ) . Helix a 0 is not observed in CHMP1B , but it is shared by ESCRT - III proteins such as yeast Snf7 where it is reported to also mediate membrane binding ( Fig . 1A and fig . S5 ) ( 28 ) . Vipp1 is distinguished from PspA by an additional C - terminal extension ( aa 220 - 258 ) comprising a flexible linker and predicted helix a 6 ( 29 ) . While the C - terminal extension has been shown to negatively regulate Vipp1 self - association in vivo ( 29 ) and might constitute a second lipid binding domain capable of modulating membrane fusion ( 21 , 30 ) , it did not yield a density in the Vipp1 C14 map , suggesting that this region is highly flexible ( Fig3A and fig . S4 ) . Interestingly , in the context of ESCRT - III proteins , similar C - terminal extensions that include a - helical elements have been shown to function as protein - protein interaction motifs ( MIM ) ( 4 ) . For CHMP1B , its C - terminal extension binds the ESCRT - III homologue Ist1 to form a dual stranded copolymer ( 23 ) . 8 Vipp1 rungs form ESCRT - III - like filaments Vipp1 C14 rings are assembled from six rungs stacked on top of each other ( Fig . 2A ) . Remarkably , each rung appears to regulate the conformation of its neighbour so that a unique asymmetric dome - shaped curvature is achieved when viewed from the side . Internally , rungs are maximally constricted at the top ( 14 nm ) and bottom ( 15 . 7 nm ) and widest at the dome equator between rungs 3 and 4 ( 17 . 5 nm ) ( Fig . 2A and 2B ) . This unique asymmetric curvature was a feature of all Vipp1 C11 - C17 ring symmetries . Whilst Vipp1 C12 - C15 rings comprised six rungs , the smallest diameter ring Vipp1 C11 incorporate five rungs and the larger Vipp1 C16 - C17 rings contains seven ( Fig . 2B ) . Within each rung , Vipp1 subunits form a staggered polymer with subunit j contacting neighbouring subunits j + 1 and j + 3 ( Fig . 3B ) . Hairpin motifs pack side by side so that helices a 1 , a 2 and a 3 of subunit j form an extended interface underneath the hairpin of neighbouring subunit j + 1 . Concurrently , the helix a 5 C - terminus ( a 5 C ) of subunit j binds across the hairpin tip of subunit j + 3 forming a contact termed here Interface 1 . Importantly , similar hairpin stacking and the equivalent hairpin / helix a 5 interface is observed within the CHMP1B filament between subunit j and subunit j + 4 ( Fig . 3B ) ( 17 , 23 ) . The hairpin - helix a 5 contact constitutes a domain swap in CHMP1B when polymerised , and is analogous to the hairpin / helix a 5 contact observed in other closed ESCRT - III conformations ( 16 , 31 ) . Interface 1 is conserved and was predicted for Vipp1 by our co - evolutionary analysis ( Fig . 1B and fig . S5 ) . To probe the contribution of Interface 1 in polymer assembly , Vipp1 truncations were generated removing either the helix a 6 C - terminal extension ( Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 ) or helices a 5 and a 6 ( Vipp1 Da 5 / 6 1 - 191 ) . Based on the Vipp1 C11 - C17 models where helix a 5 C is positioned at the tip of the spike ( Fig . 2A ) , a 6 helices likely coat the ring outside surface and do not contribute directly to polymer formation . Accordingly , both native Vipp1 and Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 formed rings and filaments as assayed using gel filtration and negative stain EM . In contrast , Vipp1 Da 5 / 6 1 - 191 ring and 9 filament formation was abolished ( fig . S6B - D ) . This result showed that helix a 5 and Interface 1 , both of which are conserved in ESCRT - III systems , are essential for Vipp1 filament and ring assembly . Conserved hinge regions facilitate domed curvature within rings The basic building block ( or asymmetric unit ) of Vipp1 C14 constitutes a stack of six monomers which when repeated by packing side by side assemble the ring ( Fig . 4A ) . Intriguingly , the six subunits within each asymmetric unit are observed in six distinct conformations . Three hinge regions mediate this conformational versatility ( Fig . 4B and movie S1 ) . They are located at the C - terminus of helix a 2 ( Hinge 1 or shoulder ) , between helix a 3 and a 4 ( Hinge 2 or elbow ) , and between helix a 4 and a 5 ( Hinge 3 or wrist ) . The tips of the Vipp1 subunit curl progressively upwards if the subunit is positioned in a rung above the ring equator ( negative curvature ) or downward if positioned below ( positive curvature ) . This curling gives each asymmetric unit a crescent shape , which allows both side by side packing and dome shaped curvature to be achieved . Importantly , the CHMP1B subunit also utilises the three Vipp1 hinges to attain different filament curvatures and to drive helical filament constriction . In particular , Hinge 1 has not previously been reported yet it accounts for a significant degree of the observed flexibility in both Vipp1 and CHMP1B . In both proteins it flexes equivalently ( ~ 6˚ ) albeit along a different axis ( Fig . 4B ) . Overall , the Vipp1 C14 structure reveals that the underlying principles for how Vipp1 flexes and achieves constriction , albeit with modification , are conserved in CHMP1B and may be usefully applied to better understand other ESCRT - III members as well . How rung stacking induces dome - like curvature 10 Vipp1 polymers self - organise so that each rung modulates the conformation of all other rungs within the ring stack . Despite the apparent complexity of the Vipp1 ring , each rung associates with its neighbour through just four interfaces . At the Vipp1 N - terminus , helices a 0 stack axially so that they line the ring lumen ( termed Interface 2 ) . In this way , helices a 0 are well positioned to bind membrane ( Fig . 2A , Fig . 4A and fig . S4A ) . As well as binding rungs together , Interface 2 also serves as a fulcrum by mediating a rotation between each helix a 0 so that the subunits towards the ring top and base increasingly tilt around the equatorial subunits ( Fig . 4A ) . In this way , the sequential tilting of each helix a 0 creates the dome shaped curvature of the ring lumen . Interface 3 forms between the N - terminus of helix a 5 ( a 5 N ) and the hairpin tip from the rung below ( Fig . 5A ) . The amino acids implicated in Interface 3 are highly conserved in both Vipp1 and PspA family members . However , Interface 3 may not form in ESCRT - III as these proteins do not include the helix a 5 N - terminal extension ( Fig . S5 ) . The remaining inter - rung contacts Interface 4 and 5 form smaller packing interfaces between helix a 4 and helix a 2 , and between Hinge 2 and helix a 1 , respectively ( Fig . 5A ) . Rungs at the bottom of the Vipp1 C14 ring are tilted relatively flat with helix a 5 in rung 5 observed 40˚ from the horizontal ( Fig . 5B and fig . S7A ) . As domed curvature increases towards the top of the ring , helix a 5 rotates upwards to a maximum of 80˚ in rung 2 . Due to Interfaces 1 and 3 , the two hairpins bound to helix a 5 co - rotate with the effect that they are pulled inward pivoting around Interface 2 ( fig . S7B ) . Thus , we hypothesise that stacking rungs cause lattice tension to build until the capping subunits reach a maximum bending limit . At this point , additional bound subunits cannot flex sufficiently to form Interface 1 or 3 , or both , so that partially disordered end rungs form as observed for Vipp1 C14 rungs 1 and 6 . Modelling dome formation 11 To test our hypothesis that domed curvature is controlled by a combination of inter - rung contacts and geometric constraints , an idealized elastic - network model of the Vipp1 C11 ring was constructed . First , an ‘average rung’ was defined that represented the average shape of a single isolated Vipp1 C11 rung . Then , the way each rung interacts with its neighbouring rungs was defined based on the contacts between rungs 3 and 4 of the Vipp1 C11 structure ( Fig . 2B and Fig . 5C ) . Finally , Vipp1 rings were initialized as cylindrical stacks of between 2 and 10 average rungs , which were then minimised subject to the intra - rung and inter - rung elastic network ( movie S2 ) . The model rings formed Vipp1 - like domes with helix a 5 rotation ( Dj i ) increasing with rung distance from the ring equator ( Fig . 5D ) . Since , by construction , the model rings had to maintain all their intra - and inter - rung contacts , the strain increased with each additional rung interface . Despite this , the cumulative helix a 5 rotation ( Dj ) between all rung interfaces plateaued near 40˚ , indicating a strict geometrical bending limit . Remarkably , this maximal rotation within the simulated stacks closely matched the measured experimental Dj in Vipp1 C11 ( Fig . 5E ) . This maximal rotation also matched the cumulative ~ 40˚ helix a 5 rotations observed for Vipp1 C14 ( Fig . 5B ) . Thus , the simulations suggest a simple self - regulatory mechanism for limiting ring stack size where strain from inter - rung rotation builds up until the formation of Interfaces 1 and 3 is no longer favourable beyond a geometrical limit of ~ 40˚ , after which further stacking is inhibited . Consistent with this , in Vipp1 C11 - C17 rings , Interface 3 was never observed between the top two rungs because the limiting geometry was already reached between the rungs immediately below . To test the importance of Interface 3 for domed curvature formation , we mutated two conserved residues F197K and L200K ( Vipp1 F197K / L200K ) within this interface . For the majority of the sample , self - assembly was abolished indicating that Interface 3 was important for both rung formation and ring stability . However , a minor fraction still formed rings and filaments . The filaments were particularly striking as they were unusually long and had a broadly uniform diameter consistent with inter - 12 rung tilt being impeded ( fig . S8A ) . These data suggest that Interface 3 forms a tensile connection between rungs that facilitates the formation of domes . One way to shift ring stack size is to tune geometric stress within the asymmetric unit by changing ring symmetry . Superposition of Vipp1 C11 - C17 asymmetric units showed how subunit bending ( movies S3 and S4 ) varies between Vipp1 C11 - C17 rings . Increasing ring symmetry and consequently ring diameter correlates with geometric stress release within the asymmetric unit . Tipping points occur between Vipp1 C11 - C12 and Vipp1 C15 - C16 , which allows rings to increase rung number from five to seven . Vipp1 polymers and membrane remodelling While the structural analysis above focused on domed rings , we also observed native Vipp1 and Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 forming multiple types of polymeric assemblies including stacks of rings , ribbons and filaments ( fig . S2B , S2D and fig . S8A ) . Fourier Bessel analysis suggest Vipp1 filaments to be helical with variable diameters and lattices . For the 14 nm diameter filament the dominant layer line corresponds to a 32 Å repeat , which matches the average axial rise between hairpins within neighbouring rungs ( fig . S2D and Fig . 4 ) . Given the Vipp1 subunit is > 16 nm in length when maximally curved , significant conformational change or lattice rearrangements may be required to build the 14 nm filament . Stack arrays were observed morphing from discrete rings into ribbons then filaments , particularly with Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 ( 21 ) ( fig . S8B ) . Overall , these micrographs indicate that Vipp1 and Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 can transition between lattices in an extraordinary display of assembly versatility reminiscent of ESCRT - III filaments ( 4 , 17 , 32 - 34 ) . To determine how Vipp1 might bind and remodel lipids , we first used a spin pelleting assay to show that N . punctiforme Vipp1 binds E . coli liposomes ( fig . S8C ) . We then directly observed the interplay between Vipp1 and ~ 1 µm diameter liposomes by negative stain EM . 13 Vipp1 rings decorated the liposome surface ( Fig . 6A and fig . S8D ) . Side views of Vipp1 bound to liposome edges clearly showed the rings attached to the membrane surface . Tilt and side views also revealed how the ring preferentially attached to the membrane via its bottom rung so that the dome - shaped curvature projected away from the lipid surface . Side views were not observed unless associated with a liposome edge . Stacks of up to six rings were often observed protruding from liposome edges ( fig . S8D ) . Stacks sometimes comprised rings of decreasing diameters to form cones . N . punctiforme Vipp1 was also observed tethering liposomes through both single rings and through bridges of stacked rings or cones ( Fig . 6A and fig . S8D ) . Tethered liposomes were consistently attached at the top and bottom of the Vipp1 ring . The observation that liposomes tended not to attach to the side of the ring suggested that helix a 6 , which coats the ring surface and may bind membrane ( 21 ) , was not a key driver of liposome tethering . To further understand how Vipp1 interacts with membrane , we exposed Vipp1 to E . coli lipid monolayers ( Fig . 6B , 6C and fig . S8E - G ) . A mosaic of rings was observed bound to the monolayer with end on views only present . Intriguingly , rings bound to lipid monolayers often had occluded lumens demarcated by white centres ( Fig . 6C ) . These occluded rings were consistent with a model where the monolayer was adsorbed onto the inner ring wall forming an encapsulated vesicle - like bud that excludes the negative stain . Discussion Here , we show that Vipp1 , PspA and ESCRT - III constitute an ancient superfamily of related membrane remodelling proteins conserved across archaea , bacteria and eukaryotes . In addition to homology at the primary amino acid sequence level ( fig . S1A ) , the Vipp1 subunit shares similar secondary structure and overall fold with ESCRT - III proteins ( Fig . 3A ) . When polymerised , Vipp1 shares core assembly features with CHMP1B ( 17 , 23 ) . This includes regions of flex that allow both polymers to assume different forms to undertake their function 14 ( Fig . 4 ) . Vipp1 contains a similar hairpin motif , elbow , and wrist joint ( Hinges 2 and 3 ) as CHMP1B ( 17 , 23 ) . As we show here , both Vipp1 and CHMP1B also have a shoulder joint located at the C - terminus of helix a 2 ( Hinge1 ) . Collectively , these conserved hinges enable the polymers to assume forms that differ widely in curvature and tilt , including a broad variety of complex 3D structures like domes ( 35 ) . In addition , both Vipp1 and CHMP1B form polymers through side - by - side packing of the hairpin motif and through helix a 5 contacting the hairpin of neighbouring subunits j + 3 or j + 4 , respectively . This helix a 5 contact , which forms Interface 1 , is conserved and represents a defining feature that explains how this superfamily of proteins generate polymers . Whilst both Vipp1 and CHMP1B form helical filaments , here we describe the architecture of seven 1 . 6 - 3 . 4 MDa Vipp1 rings from the cyanobacteria N . punctiforme . The sequence of ring symmetries presented ranging from C11 - C17 allows an unprecedented snapshot into the structural flexibility that enables Vipp1 , PspA and ESCRT - III family members to perform their functions . Furthermore , as each ring comprises between 5 - 7 rungs stacked together to build a unique dome - shaped architecture , our models show the first glimpse into the structural features that enable polymer or filament tilt in an ESCRT - III - like system . This is important as simulations have shown that filament tilt may facilitate ESCRT - III transition from a planar spiral to a three - dimensional cone so as to generate force and drive membrane deformation ( 35 ) . The physiological role of Vipp1 within the cell remains enigmatic with possible functions in mitigating membrane stress in photosynthetic membranes as well as in thylakoid membrane biogenesis and repair . The closely related bacterial PspA is known to mediate inner membrane repair in response to membrane stress . With only relatively low resolution structural data available for both the Vipp1 and PspA rings ( 13 , 36 ) , it is not well understood how Vipp1 and PspA mitigate membrane stress . Here , our Vipp1 C11 - C17 structures suggest a mechanism 15 for stabilising or repairing localised sections of breached or perturbed membrane . They also provide a mechanism for Vipp1 and PspA mediated membrane curving and tubulation . When membrane was modelled into the Vipp1 C11 - C17 structures as a 4 nm bilayer , sequential constriction was observed with the membrane lumen reaching ~ 3 nm within Vipp1 C11 ( Fig . 6D ) . This is important as membrane hemifusion or hemifission is achieved when the membrane lumen reaches the approximate thickness of the bilayer ( 37 , 38 ) . As we show using membrane binding assays ( Fig . 6B , 6C and fig . S8E ) , in the simplest instance Vipp1 rings will bind to membrane breaches or local bilayer perturbations through exposed a 0 helices at the ring base . a 0 helices pack as sub - filaments that line the inner lumen of the ring and form a continuous axial membrane binding interface . This arrangement suggests that a capillary action mechanism draws the membrane into the ring lumen to form a highly curved tubule . It also explains why liposomes are pulled into the central lumen of preformed Chlamydomonas Vipp1 helical filaments ( 20 ) . As Vipp1 rings are most constricted at their top , membrane becomes increasingly squeezed as it ascends the inner lumen . The Vipp1 C11 inner lumen diameter is sufficiently constricted to achieve membrane hemifusion , meaning breached or perturbed membrane leaflets converge to a point of stabilisation or fusion at the dome apex ( Fig . 6E ) . This is consistent with the observation that Synechocystis Vipp1 bound to liposomes bends the membrane in regions proximal to the ring ( 36 ) . Additionally , ring stacking and cone formation provide a mechanism to sequentially suck and constrict membrane into tubules ( Fig . 6E ) . Overall , this model is similar to the previously proposed mechanism of ESCRT - III mediated membrane fusion to repair damaged endolysosomes - albeit that in this case membrane remodelling was proposed to occur via the constriction of spiral filaments rather than rings ( 39 ) . Given Vipp1 mediated membrane fusion may occur in vitro ( 21 , 30 , 36 ) , it is possible that rings and ring stacks tether and bridge opposed membranes ( Fig . 6A and fig . S8D ) as a precursor to membrane fusion . In any bridging event , it may be possible that Vipp1 rings , 16 stacks or filaments extend from both opposing membranes so that a seam of opposing hand is created where the polymers merge , as observed in Chlamydomonas Vipp1 protein - lipid tubes ( 20 ) . In summary , our results unite bacterial , plastidial and archaeal PspA and Vipp1 into a family of bacterial ESCRT - III proteins ( bESCRT - III ) . They show that eukaryotic ESCRT - III ( eESCRT - III ) and bESCRT - III are ancient membrane remodelling machines that were present in some of the earliest of cells and possibly even our last universal common ancestor ( LUCA ) .

ESCRT - III / Snf7 / CdvB and PspA / Vipp1 proteins are part of the same super - family . ( A ) ESCRT - III ( human CHMP1B and yeast Snf7 ) and PspA ( N . punctiforme Vipp1 and E . coli PspA ) protein families are homologues ( Fig S1A ) and have a similar secondary structural organisation ( alpha helices labelled a 0 to a 6 ) . ( B ) A co - evolutionary analysis reveals similarities in the tertiary structure of PspA and ESCRT - III proteins . ( Left ) Plot shows a co - evolutionary residue contact map ( using numbering based on the N . punctiforme Vipp1 sequence ) super - imposed on ESCRT - III residue - residue distance data extracted from the experimentally determined structure of human CHMP3 ( PDB code 3FRT ) .

Domed shaped curvature is observed from the side and in the central slice . The ring is widest at the equatorial plane both internally and externally . ( B ) Side view gallery of Vipp1 C11 - C17 rings . Bar chart indicates maximal outer diameter ( OD ) and maximal inner diameter ( ID ) as measured at the external and internal equator . Note that Vipp1 C16 - C17 have seven rungs whilst Vipp1 C11 has just five . 21 Fig . 3 . Vipp1 has a similar fold and assembly mechanism as ESCRT - III . ( A ) Vipp1 has the same helical domain organisation as ESCRT - III CHMP1B . The hairpin motif is a hallmark of the Vipp1 , PspA and ESCRT - III families . ( B ) Vipp1 and CHMP1B form similar polymers based on hairpin packing and helix a 5 domain swap . A single circular polymer forms each rung of the Vipp1 ring . Zoom boxes show Interface 1 where the helix a 5 domain swap binds the hairpin tip of a neighbouring subunit in both Vipp1 ( j + 3 ) and CHMP1B ( j + 4 ) . 22 Fig . 4 . Analysis of the Vipp1 C14 ring asymmetric unit . ( A ) The ring asymmetric unit comprises an axial stack of six subunits each in its own distinct conformation . Subunits in rung 1 and 6 have disordered helices a 4 - a 6 . Zoom box shows Interface 2 formed from helix a 0 contacting neighbouring helix a 0 and helix a 1 N - terminus . ( B ) Vipp1 and CHMP1B share conserved flexible joints called Hinge 1 - 3 ( shoulder , elbow and wrist ) . Superposition of Vipp1 asymmetric unit subunits from rungs 2 - 5 aligned onto hairpin helices a 1 and a 2 . Subunits transition between negatively and positively curved conformations from the top ( rung 2 ) to the bottom ( rung 5 ) . 23 Fig . 5 . Mechanism for Vipp1 axial or domed curvature . ( A ) Analysis of inter - rung contacts . Zoom boxes show Interfaces 3 - 5 , which combined with Interface 2 ( Fig . 4A ) , define all inter - rung contacts . ( B ) Exploded side view of Vipp1 C14 shows how each ring comprises a stack of discrete rungs . Each rung constitutes a circular Vipp1 polymer with a distinct conformation . Helix a 5 is sandwiched between an intra - rung hairpin ( Interface 1 ) and an inter - rung hairpin ( Interface 3 ) , which rotate collectively to induce ring constriction and curvature . Geometric constraint ultimately limits constriction . ( C - E ) MD simulations based on Vipp1 C11 show that inter - rung interfaces define domed curvature . C shows overlay of the Vipp1 C11 structure with a four rung simulation resulting in an equilibrium structure with dome - shaped curvature . Df i = inter - rung rotation of helix a 5 . Df = cumulative rotation of helix a 5 over all rungs . D shows Df i plots from simulations with 2 , 4 , 6 and 8 rung stacks with C11 symmetry . Df i for Vipp1 C11 rungs 2 - 5 ( blue ) . The largest rotations are observed at the ring top and bottom . E shows Df as a function of rung stack size . Geometric constraints limit the total Df to near ~ 40˚ regardless of stack size . The limit in Df from simulated stacks matches the Df from Vipp1 C11 . 24 Fig . 6 . Mechanism of Vipp1 membrane repair and fusion . ( A ) Vipp1 rings decorate and tether liposomes together .

Evolutionary relationship of ESCRT - III / Snf7 / CdvB and PspA / Vipp1 proteins . ( A ) ESCRT - III / Snf7 / CdvB and PspA / Vipp1 protein families are homologues based on an 26 analysis performed using HHPred ( 8 ) . The alignment of human CHMP3 ( ESCRT - III ) and N . punctiforme Vipp1 is based on their HMM profiles . Only highly conserved ( uppercase ) and moderately conserved ( lowercase ) HMM consensus positions are displayed .

Sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega and include Vipp1 / IM30 Nostoc 33 punctiforme ( Uniprot code B2J6D9 ) , Vipp2 Nostoc punctiforme ( Uniprot code B2J6E0 ) , Escherichia coli PspA ( Uniprot code P0AFM6 ) , Synechocystis sp . Vipp1 ( Uniprot code A0A068MW27 ) , Yersinia pestis PspA ( Uniprot code Q0WEH0 ) , human CHMP2A ( Uniprot code O43633 ) , yeast SNF7 ( Uniprot code P39929 ) , human CHMP1B ( Uniprot code Q7LBR1 ) , human CHMP4A ( Uniprot code Q9BY43 ) and human CHMP3 ( Uniprot code Q0Y3E7 ) .

( A ) Vipp1 monomer structure sequence register validation based on cysteine cross - linking . Zoom box indicates position of L193C and L86C mutants ( Vipp1 L86C / L193C ) with the sulphur atoms predicted to be ~ 6 Å within the Vipp1 C14 structure . Vipp1 L86C / L193C forms an inter - rung connection between helix a 5 and the hairpin motif ( Interface 3 ) . Disulphide bond formation is observed only in the presence of oxidising agent Cu ( II ) - phenanthroline ( CuP ) and MTS4 cross - linker . Disulphide bond 35 formation can be rescued upon subsequent DTT incubation . * indicates uncleaved MBP - Vipp1 fusion protein . Vipp1 L86C showed higher levels of proteolysis and resistance to full MBP cleavage than normal presumably due to the sensitive position of the mutation . ( B ) Vipp1 subunit cartoon schematics showing wild type ( WT ) , Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 and Vipp1 Da 5 / 6 1 - 191 secondary structure . ( C , D ) Filament assembly assay . In C , comparison of WT , Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 and Vipp1 Da 5 / 6 1 - 191 size exclusion profiles using a sephacryl S - 500 resin . Associated SDS - PAGE is shown analysing the column exclusion limit ( void volume ) , Peak 1 containing high molecular weight species greater than Ferritin ( 440 kDa ) and usually associated with Vipp1 C11 - C17 rings , and Peak 2 associated with low molecular weight proteins such as maltose - binding protein ( 42 kDa ) . Negative stain EM analysis is shown in D for void volume , Peak 1 and Peak 2 . WT and Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 behave similarly with filaments observed in the void volume and Vipp1 C11 - C17 rings observed in Peak 1 . In contrast , Vipp1 Da 5 / 6 1 - 191 does not form filaments or rings and instead runs as a low molecular weight species consistent with monomer or dimer . This experiment shows that helix a 5 is essential for polymer formation whilst helix a 6 is not . It also broadly validates the helix a 5 and a 6 domain assignment within the Vipp1 structures . 36 Fig . S7 . Mechanism for Vipp1 axial or domed curvature . ( A ) Exploded top view of Vipp1 C14 shows how each ring comprises a stack of discrete rungs . Each rung constitutes a circular Vipp1 polymer with a distinct conformation . Ring diameters were measured at the helix a 1 N - terminus so as to highlight hairpin constriction between rungs . ( B ) Comparison of rung 5 and rung 2 to highlight the conformational changes required to drive domed curvature . For each rung only those subunits are shown ( j and j + 3 ) that interconnect via Interface 1 to form one turn . Polymer tilt involves hairpin and helix a 5 rotation ( Interface 1 and 3 ) around Interface 2 , which appears to represent a fulcrum within the centre of each subunit . Helix a 0 within Interface 2 also rotates to create the domed curvature of the inner lumen . Increasing polymer or filament tilt and rotation builds subunit tension until ultimately geometric constraint limits the formation of Interface 3 and / or Interface 1 along with further rung stacking and constriction . 37 Fig . S8 . Negative stain EM analyses of Vipp1 and Vipp1 mutants in the presence and absence of lipids . ( A ) Vipp1 F197K / L200K forms unusually long filaments with broadly uniform diameter suggesting that loss of Interface 3 impedes filament tilt and axial curving ( left two 38 panels ) . Zoom panel shows close up of the filament outlined by the dotted rectangle . Filament diameter is ~ 22 nm . Right panel shows Fourier Bessel analysis of the zoomed filament with a dominant repeat at 43 Å . The filament diameter and likely helical repeat appears consistent with the ~ 22 nm Vipp1 wild type filament ( fig . S2D ) . Scale bar = 50 nm . ( B ) Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 forms individual rings , ring stacks and filaments . Compared to native Vipp1 , Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 has a much greater propensity to form ring stacks and filaments . Zoom panel shows region outlined by dotted rectangle where ring stacks can be observed morphing into filaments and acting as nucleation points for filament formation and lattice transitions . Scale bar = 50 nm . ( C ) Native Vipp1 spin assay in the presence and absence of E . coli liposomes .

( D ) Gallery of micrographs showing how Vipp1 rings decorate and tether liposomes ( L ) together . Individual rings or ring stacks form bridges between liposomes . Vipp1 is rarely observed unattached to a liposome and resting on the carbon surface . Vipp1 stacks may reduce in diameter to form cones ( white arrows ) . Scale bar = 50 nm . ( E ) Left panel - Vipp1 rings decorate a lipid monolayer ( ML ) . Zoom panel shows region outlined by dotted rectangle .

Conformational change is mediated by Hinges 1 - 3 conserved between Vipp1 and ESCRT - III - like proteins . Movie S2 . Minimised elastic - network model of Vipp1 forms Vipp1 - like domes . The initial structure is a C11 stack composed of eight identical and energy minimized rungs that contains no inter - rung interactions . Inter - rung interactions are added and the movie traces the minimisation of the elastic energy . The equilibrium structure reached is a domed structure that balances the inter - rung rotation favoured by the inter - rung interactions with the overall distortion in each rung . Movies S3 and S4 . Front and side view morph between superposed Vipp1 C11 - C17 asymmetric units . Morph shows range of conformational changes between different ring symmetries . 42 Materials and Methods Methods ESCRT - III homology searches , secondary structure prediction and co - evolutionary analysis . To search for ESCRT - III relatives , we used sensitive protein sequence searches based on Hidden Markov Models ( HMMs ; HHMER ( 40 ) , HHPred ( 8 ) and Pfam ( 41 ) ) . Several individual eukaryotic ESCRT - III proteins , multiple sequence alignments and HMM profiles were used as queries in these searches . These analyses consistently identified PspA / Vipp1 proteins as the only ESCRT - III homologues in sequence , domain and structural databases ( Uniprot ( 42 ) , GenBank ( 43 ) , Pfam ( 41 ) and PDB ( 44 ) ) . This observation was corroborated by the fact that these protein families share a common Pfam clan which only includes PspA and ESCRT - III ( Pfam CL0235 ) . Secondary structure predictions were performed using HHPred ( 8 ) , Phyre2 ( 45 ) and Psipred ( 46 ) software . To obtain a statistical model of the PspA / Vipp1 family that captures patterns of residue co - evolution , Gremlin ( 14 , 15 ) was used . For this analysis , a total of 2844 homologous proteins were obtained using N . punctiforme Vipp1 as a query , four iterations of JackHHMER searches , E - value ≤ 1e - 10 , using a coverage filter of 50 % and gap removal of 75 % . Phylogenetic studies . The phylogenetic distribution of the PspA / Vipp1 and ESCRT - III families was generated using AnnoTree ( 47 ) searches in Pfam ( 41 ) and an E - value ≤ 1e - 05 . Homologues of these protein families were retrieved from Uniprot ( 42 ) by HMMER ( 40 ) searching and from InterPro ( 48 ) database , followed by manual inspection . Eukaryotic , archaeal and bacterial PspA and ESCRT - III proteins were selected to achieve a broad distribution of homologues across the tree of life . In total , 264 PspA and 332 ESCRT - III sequences were selected , aligned using the l - INS - I mode in mafft 7 . 3 . 1 ( 49 ) , and poorly - aligned regions were identified and removed using the “gappyout” mode in trimAl 1 . 3 ( 50 ) . The 43 phylogeny was inferred in IQ - Tree 1 . 6 . 10 ( 51 ) under the LG + C30 + G + F model , which was the best - fitting model according to the BIC criterion . This model accounts for differences in exchange rates among amino acids ( LG ) , different site compositions ( C30 + F ) , and models across - site rate variation using a discretized Gamma distribution with 4 rate categories . Branch supports are ultrafast ( UFBoot2 ( 52 ) ) bootstraps . Vipp1 cloning , protein expression and purification . Plasmid mutagenesis and all clones were generated using the Gibson isothermal DNA assembly protocol ( 53 ) . Plasmids and primers used in this study are listed in Table S2 . The coding sequence for Nostoc punctiforme vipp1 ( Uniprot code B2J6D9 ) was cloned into pOPTM ( a pET derivative ) to yield an N - terminal MBP fusion with a TEV cleavage site in the linker . An N - terminal hexahistidine tag was included on the MBP moiety . For the purification of both native and mutant Vipp1 , clones were co - transformed into E . coli C43 ( DE3 ) electro - competent cells ( Lucigen ) modified here to incorporate a pspA gene knockout using a Lambda Red recombinase strategy ( 54 ) . Cells were grown on selective LB - agarose plates with ampicillin ( 100 μg / ml ) . 2xYT media was inoculated and cells grown at 37 °C until induction at OD600 = 0 . 8 with 1 mM isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . Cells were grown for ~ 15 h at 18 °C and shaken at 220 rpm . All the further steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise specified . Purification of Vipp1 L86C , Vipp1 L193C and Vipp1 L86C / L193C were performed in the presence of 2 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) . Pellets were re - suspended in ice - cold buffer 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , treated with 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mg / ml DNase I , 0 . 5 mg / ml lysozyme and sonicated on ice . The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 16 , 000 × g for 20 min . The supernatant was incubated with gentle shaking for 1 h with 10 mL of amylose resin ( NEB ) pre - equilibrated in 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl ( wash buffer ) . The resin was washed with 100 mL and purified MBP - Vipp1 eluted with wash buffer supplemented with 15 mM maltose . The sample was incubated for 24 h at room temperature with TEV and then dialysed 44 ( 12 - 14 kDa MW cut - off ) overnight in 25 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 4 , 40 mM NaCl . The sample was concentrated and injected onto a sephacryl 16 / 60 S500 gel filtration column equilibrated in 25 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl . A typical elution profile for Vipp1 consisted of three peaks containing 1 ) Vipp1 superstructures such as filaments eluting at ~ 40mL within the column size exclusion limit or void volume , 2 ) Vipp1 rings eluting at ~ 65 mL , 3 ) non - polymerised low molecular weight Vipp1 species consistent with monomer or dimers , MBP and TEV eluting at ~ 100 mL . Fractions from peak 1 and 2 were pooled and concentrated up to 1 mg / mL . Where necessary , the sample was gel filtrated a second time to reduce residual MBP or TEV contamination . LC - MS / MS confirmed the identity of the Vipp1 band identified by SDS - PAGE . Note that native Vipp1 migrates at ~ 38 kDa and not at its expected molecular weight of 28 . 7 kDa . As Vipp1 Da 5 / 6 1 - 191 gel filtrates only in peak 3 , the removal of MBP and TEV was necessary for a clean SDS - PAGE analysis . An additional affinity chromatography step was therefore included directly before gel filtration using 2 x 5 mL HisTraps ( GE Healthcare ) . As both the MBP and TEV proteins incorporate a hexahistidine tag , the flow through containing Vipp1 Da 5 / 6 1 - 191 was collected for subsequent steps . Dynamin cloning , protein expression and purification . The rat dynamin 1 gene ( Uniprot code P21575 ) with the PRD domain truncated was cloned into pOPTM vector yielding an N - terminal MBP fusion with a TEV cleavage site in the linker . A C - terminal hexahistidine tag was included on Dynamin 1 . E . coli thioredoxin was inserted at the Dynamin 1 N - terminus through Gibson assembly . The role of the thioredoxin , which was not cleaved off , was to stop the large - scale clumping of Dynamin 1 filaments in solution and to facilitate a broad distribution of filaments on the EM grid . Transformed E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells were grown on selective LB - agarose plates with ampicillin ( 100 μg / ml ) . 2xYT media was inoculated and cells grown at 37 °C until induction at OD600 = 0 . 6 with 1 mM isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . Cells were grown for ~ 15 h at 19 °C and shaken at 220 rpm . All 45 the further steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise specified . For purification , pellets were re - suspended in 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 2 mM DTT , 2 mM EDTA and sonicated on ice . The lysate was clarified by centrifugation in a Ti45 rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) at 98 , 000 × g at 4 °C for 45 min and the supernatant loaded onto a self - packed column with ~ 10 ml of amylose resin ( NEB ) pre - equilibrated in 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 9 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA and 20 % glycerol ( wash buffer ) . The resin was washed with 200 mL of wash buffer and the MBP - Dynamin 1 eluted with wash buffer supplemented with 15 mM maltose . The sample was incubated overnight at room temperature with TEV and the products separated by gel filtration using a HiPrep 26 / 60 Sephacryl S300 column in buffer 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 9 . 0 , 1mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT . Fractions of Dynamin 1 were concentrated to ~ 10 mg / ml , flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C . Cryo - EM sample preparation and data collection . Under cryogenic conditions N . punctiforme Vipp1 exhibits significant preferred orientation so that essential side views for determining the structure were absent . To solve this issue , preformed Dynamin 1 filaments with 37 nm diameter were mixed with Vipp1 prior to vitrification . Rat Dynamin 1 filaments appear equivalent to human Dynamin 1 filaments in the super constricted state ( 22 ) . The Dynamin 1 filaments formed a network on the grid that helped to maintain ice thickness around Vipp1 rings so that positioning at the air - water interface was reduced and side views captured . 37 . 5 µM Dynamin 1 was incubated with 20 mM HEPES - NaOH pH 7 . 2 , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 2mM GMPPCP and 5 mM MgCl 2 at room temperature for 2 hours to form filaments . 35 µM Vipp1 was then mixed with the pre - formed dynamin filaments . 4 μl of the mixture was incubated for 30 s on glow discharged holey R2 / 2 Quantifoil grids before vitrification in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV ( FEI ) . Data were collected at 300 kV on a Titan Krios ( M02 beamline at eBIC Diamond , UK ) equipped with a Gatan Quantum K2 Summit detector . 3206 movies were acquired at a magnification of ×35 , 971 yielding 1 . 39 Å / pixel using EPU software . 46 Defocus was between - 1 . 25 and - 3 . 0 . Movies were dose - weighted over 40 frames with 10 s exposures . Total dose was 50 e / Å 2 . Cryo - EM image processing . Individual movie frames were aligned with MotionCor2 ( 55 ) and the contrast transfer function estimated using CTFFIND4 ( 56 ) . All subsequent processing was carried out using Relion 3 . 0 ( 57 ) . Particles were picked manually to generate initial 2D class averages that were subsequently used for reference based auto - picking . Extracted particles were subjected to five rounds of 2D classification resulting in a cleaned stack of 109 , 715 particles . To generate the initial 3D model , a subset of 2D classes comprising C14 symmetry top views and side views with diameter range from 28 nm to 32 nm were selected ( 24 , 355 particles ) . 3D classification was carried out in C1 using a featureless hollowed cylinder as the initial reference . One class containing 9 , 991 particles yielded a ring with distinct C14 symmetry , which was chosen for high - resolution reconstruction first . These particles were then 3D autorefined with C14 symmetry applied reaching 8 . 5 Å resolution . The resulting map ( Intermediate map 1 ) showed clear secondary structure features and was used as the new C14 reference volume for a second round of processing . In round two , side views only of 2D class averages were selected and 3D classified iteratively in C1 using Intermediate map 1 as a reference volume . In this way 15 , 767 side views with C14 symmetry were isolated . These side views were combined with 3 , 663 C14 top view particles obtained during 2D classification . A 3D autorefinement was undertaken with C14 symmetry applied to yield a reconstruction at 7 . 0 Å resolution ( Intermediate map 2 ) . Individual particles were then corrected for beam - induced motion for a third round of processing . One round of 3D classification was undertaken in C1 using Intermediate map 2 as the reference volume . A final stack of 17 , 114 particles was then used for 3D autorefinement with C14 symmetry applied reaching 6 . 8 Å resolution . Post - processing yielded 6 . 5 Å resolution with an auto - estimated B - factor ( 58 ) of −291 . 9 Å 2 applied to sharpen the final 3D map . Resolutions reported are based on gold standard Fourier shell 47 correlations ( FSC ) = 0 . 143 . Once the Vipp1 C14 structure was built and targeted masks of asymmetric units or individual rungs could readily be generated , multiple subtraction based local refinements including symmetry expansion strategies were attempted but no improvement in resolution was observed . A similar strategy as implemented for Vipp1 C14 was carried out to generate all other ring symmetries including Vipp1 C11 - C13 and Vipp1 C15 - C17 . A B - factor of - 320 Å 2 was applied to these maps . The hand of the electron density maps was unambiguously determined by fitting the PspA crystal structure ( PDB code 4WHE ) , which has a distinct axial twist and asymmetry . Statistics for data collection and 3D refinement for all maps are included in Table S1 . Model building and refinement . Rung 3 of the Vipp1 C14 structure was built first . A secondary structure prediction was obtained using Psipred ( 46 ) . A partial Vipp1 homology model based on PspA ( PDB code 4WHE ) was generated using I - Tasser ( 59 ) . The model was trimmed to include amino acids 24 - 142 , which represents the hairpin motif . Importantly for obtaining an accurate sequence register in the Vipp1 structure , Vipp1 aligns robustly with PspA in this region with 32 . 5 % sequence identity , 59 % similarity and crucially 0 % gaps . The hairpin readily fitted into the Vipp1 C14 map requiring only minor adjustments . Overall the hairpin from Vipp1 C14 rung number 3 ( PDB 6ZW4 ) and PspA hairpin motifs have a C a RMSD = 2 . 2 Å ( Fig . S4E ) . The hairpin homology model provided an important anchor for subsequently building the N - terminal helix a 0 and C - terminal helices a 4 and a 5 . The resolution for the bulk of Vipp1 C14 within rungs 3 and 4 was ~ 5 Å so that the main chain could be easily traced and helices a 0 - a 5 clearly assigned and built using COOT ( 60 ) . Significant attention was paid to regions of high sequence conservation as a guide for sequence register within predicted interfaces . Similarly , our co - evolutionary contact maps ( Fig . 1B ) were used to confirm interfaces and expected sequence register . Ultimately , the accuracy of the sequence register was experimentally assessed by the introduction of a cysteine pair within Interface 3 and 48 tracking cross - links ( Fig . S6A ) . Rosetta ( 61 ) was used to improve the geometry . The subunit from rung 3 was copied and rigid body fitted into all other rungs within the asymmetric unit using Chimera Fit in map command ( 62 ) . COOT and ISOLDE ( 63 ) were used to adjust for rung specific conformational changes . Using PHENIX ( 64 ) , non - crystallographic symmetry ( NCS ) was applied to each asymmetric unit to generate a complete Vipp1 C14 84 chain model . This model was truncated to main chain and rigid body and B factor refined in PHENIX . For all other ring symmetries , the Vipp1 C14 asymmetric model was fitted using Chimera Fit in map command . COOT and ISOLDE ( 63 ) were used to adjust for conformational changes specific to ring symmetry . For each ring , NCS was applied to generate complete ring models . All subsequent steps were as for Vipp1 C14 . The final models were assessed using Molprobity and statistics outlined in Table S1 ( 65 ) . The correlation between map and model ( CC mask ) as generated by the phenix . map _ model _ cc command was C11 - 0 . 8 , C12 - 0 . 82 , C13 - 0 . 77 , C14 - 0 . 84 , C15 - 0 . 8 , C16 - 0 . 67 , C17 - 0 . 58 . Elastic network model . To understand the relationship between inter - rung stacking and the creation of domed curvature in Vipp1 rings , molecular modeling was used focused on the smallest ring system - Vipp1 C11 for simplicity . Each residue was represented by a single bead at the position of the C a atom . The potential energy of the structure was defined by an elastic network model ( ENM ) , meaning that interactions between residues nearby in the experimental structure were restrained by harmonic springs . Nearby in the contact map was defined by C a distances within 10 Å . All springs were given the same stiffness . The elastic network for each rung was identical , both internally ( intra - rung ) and in the interactions made with the rungs above it and below it ( inter - rung ) . While the experimental Vipp1 C11 structure enforced each monomer to be identical within a rung , the monomers between rungs showed small differences . To create the intra - rung network , the contact map for 49 all monomers in rungs with a complete structure ( 11 * 4 monomers in Vipp1 C11 rungs 2 - 5 ) were compared and a spring was created for each contact provided it existed in > 50 % of the monomers . As the conformational changes in the monomers between different rungs are small , only a few contacts were removed in this process . Those removed were localized to the regions showing the largest shifts between rungs , namely Hinges 2 and 3 within the Vipp1 monomer ( Fig . 4B ) . Removing these outlier contacts allows the network to better model the inherent flexibility of the Vipp1 monomer . Note that the intra - rung contacts included contacts between monomers within the same rung . The natural length of each spring was defined as the average of its contact distances over the monomers . In this way , an ENM for an average rung was created . The average rung best matched rung 3 , with a C a RMSD of 0 . 5 Å . The inter - ring contact map was defined by the interactions between Vipp1 C11 rungs three and four ( Fig . 2B ) as rung 5 at the bottom is incomplete . We then computed the equilibrium structure for different stack sizes by minimizing the elastic energy . This minimization was performed by molecular dynamics ( MD ) at a low temperature followed by a steepest decent minimization . SMOG2 ( 66 ) with the template “ENM” was used to create topology files for the MD software GROMACS ( 67 ) using the Vipp1 C11 PDB structure as input ( PDB code 6ZVR ) . These topology files were processed as described in the previous paragraph . Initial structures for minimization were created in VMD by manually copying rung three and translating it N times , where N is the desired number of rungs . The equilibrium structures resulted from balancing the competing effects of 1 ) the inter - rung interactions driving curvature and 2 ) the geometrical constraints of doming . While in principle some of the strain could be alleviated by breaking links , this is not allowed in the ENM . This constraint is not present in the experimental system , which may explain why the densities show that parts of the upper and lower rungs do fail to assemble properly and become 50 disordered . The rotations between rungs in the equilibrium structures were analyzed by measuring the angle formed by helix a 5 with the dome axis ( Fig . 5B ) . The axis is defined by the z - axis in the experimental structure . The line along the direction of helix a 5 is defined by two points taken as the centers of mass of residues 194 - 202 and residues 211 - 219 . Vipp1 cysteines crosslinking assay . DTT was removed from 1 mg / mL Vipp1 L86C , Vipp1 L193C or Vipp1 L86C / L193C using PD MiniTrap G - 25 columns ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated in 25 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl . Samples were diluted to 5 µM and incubated with either 10 mM DTT , ortho - Cu ( II ) 1 , 10 - phenanthroline ( CuP , stock 10 mM in 20 % ethanol ) or 5 µM 1 , 4 - Butanediylbismethanethiosulfonate ( MTS - 4 , stock 50 mM in chloroform ) for 1 h at room temperature . Vipp1 L86C / L193C cross - linked samples were rescued with 10 mM DTT for 1 h at room temperature . Non - reacted cysteines were blocked by the addition of 10 mM N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM , stock 0 . 5 M in 100 % ethanol ) . Samples were evaluated by SDS - PAGE . Liposome preparation . Liposomes were prepared using E . coli total lipid extract ( Avanti polar lipids , US ) . Lipid extract was dissolved in chloroform at 25 mg / mL in a glass vial ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Chloroform was evaporated and the lipid dried for 1 h in a vacuum desiccator . The residual lipid film coating the bottom of the vial was hydrated using liposome reaction buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 8 . 0 and 80 mM KCl ) at a concentration of 6 mg / ml . The lipid was resuspended by vortexing and gentle sonication with a needle tip for 2 min on ice . The suspension was extruded through polycarbonate membranes with 1 or 0 . 2 µm pore size using a mini - extruder ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) to create large or small unilamellar vesicles ( LUV / SUV ) . LUV and SUV were stored at 4 ° C for subsequent use . 51 Vipp1 liposome binding assays and negative stain EM . Liposome binding assays were performed by incubating freshly prepared 2 mM SUV with and without purified 5 µM Vipp1 for 2 h at room temperature in liposome reaction buffer . 5 µ L of each sample was loaded onto glow - discharged 200 - mesh carbon coated copper grids and stained with 2 % uranyl acetate ( UA ) . Images were acquired using a FEI Tecnai Spirit microscope equipped with a 2 K Eagle camera . Spin Assay . To detect Vipp1 membrane binding a spin assay was used . 10 . 5 µM Vipp1 was ultra - centrifuged at 50 , 000 x g at 20 ° C for 15 min using a TLA100 rotor to remove any initial aggregation . The supernatant from this first spin was collected and incubated with and without 2 mg / ml LUV for 1 h at room temperature . Samples were subjected to a second spin at 30 , 000 x g at 20 °C for 30 min . The pellet ( P ) and the supernatant ( S ) were harvested , made up to equal volumes in LDS sample buffer and analysed by SDS - PAGE . Vipp1 monolayer assays . Lipid monolayers were prepared using E . coli total lipid extract ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) . A custom - made Teflon block containing 4 mm x 4 mm diameter wells were filled with 50 µ L of assay buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 and NaCl 50 mM ) . A 5 µ L drop of 0 . 1 mg / ml lipid dissolved in chloroform was applied to the top of the buffer solution and the chloroform left to evaporate for 1 h . A non - glow discharged carbon coated copper grid was gently placed on top of the lipid layer with the carbon side faced towards the lipid layer . Subsequently , 14 µM Vipp1 was injected into the well using a side port . The control wells containing either monolayer ( no protein ) or protein only ( a drop of chloroform but no lipid ) were set up in parallel . Samples were incubated for 2 h before grids were recovered and immediately stained with 2 % UA and imaged using a FEI Tecnai Spirit microscope equipped with a 2 K Eagle camera . Images were taken at 89020 x magnification and 3 . 37 Å pixel size . 52 263 and 156 images were collected of Vipp1 with and without lipid monolayer , respectively , as described above . Gctf1 . 06 ( 68 ) was used for estimating the contrast transfer function . Processing steps including particle picking and extraction , and 2D classification were carried out using Relion 3 . 1 ( 57 ) . The final class averages were generated from stacks comprising 11 , 972 and 2 , 165 particles for Vipp1 with and without lipid monolayer . 53 References 1 . J . Wagstaff , J .
