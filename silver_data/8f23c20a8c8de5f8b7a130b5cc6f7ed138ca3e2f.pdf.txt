Billadeau 2 , 6 Protein recycling through the endolysosomal system relies on molecular assemblies that interact with cargo proteins , membranes , and effector molecules . Among them , the COMMD / CCDC22 / CCDC93 ( CCC ) complex plays a critical role in recycling events . While CCC is closely associated with retriever , a cargo recognition complex , its mechanism of action remains unexplained . Herein we show that CCC and retriever are closely linked through sharing a common subunit ( VPS35L ) , yet the integrity of CCC , but not retriever , is required to maintain normal endosomal levels of phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate ( PI ( 3 ) P ) . CCC complex depletion leads to elevated PI ( 3 ) P levels , enhanced recruitment and activation of WASH ( an actin nucleation promoting factor ) , excess endosomal F - actin and trapping of internalized receptors . Mechanistically , we ﬁ nd that CCC regulates the phosphorylation and endosomal recruitment of the PI ( 3 ) P phosphatase MTMR2 . Taken together , we show that the regulation of PI ( 3 ) P levels by the CCC complex is critical to protein recycling in the endosomal compartment . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12221 - 6 OPEN 1 Department of Internal Medicine , and Department of Molecular Biology , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , TX 75390 , USA . 2 Division of Oncology Research and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , College of Medicine , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN 55905 , USA . 3 Life Sciences Institute , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , MI 48109 , USA . 4 Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children , Department of Paediatrics , Division of Neurology , West China Second University Hospital , State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy , Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , China . 5 These authors contributed equally : Amika Singla and Alina Fedoseienko . 6 These authors jointly supervised : Ezra Burstein and Daniel D .

Once internalized , these plasma membrane proteins can be delivered to lysosomes for degradation , transported to the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) or recycled back to the plasma membrane 1 . This tightly orchestrated process involves multiple proteins and protein complexes that are recruited to endosomal membranes through either protein – protein or protein – lipid interactions . For example , Rab5 - GTP accumulation on early endosomes leads to the recruitment of multiple effector proteins including the phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase , VPS34 , which converts phospha - tidylinositol ( PI ) to PI ( 3 ) P 2 – 4 . Signi ﬁ cantly , PI ( 3 ) P accumulation on endosomes facilitates the spatial and temporal recruitment of numerous proteins that contain PI ( 3 ) P - binding domains such as sorting nexins ( SNX ) 5 . The conversion of PI ( 3 ) P to other PI species leads to the displacement of PI ( 3 ) P - binding proteins and the recruitment of a new set of PI - binding proteins , a process that regulates endosomal maturation and receptor traf ﬁ cking 1 , 6 . Sig - ni ﬁ cantly , inherited mutations in genes that regulate PI conver - sion in the endolysosomal system are linked to several human diseases 7 – 10 . Establishing different traf ﬁ cking pathways for internalized receptors depends on motifs within their cytoplasmic sequences that can segregate these potential cargoes through their recogni - tion by speci ﬁ c traf ﬁ cking pathway regulators . Among these cargo selection regulators are members of the SNX protein family , including SNX27 and SNX17 11 , 12 . In addition to being recruited to endosomes through their PI ( 3 ) P - binding phox - homology domains , SNX17 and SNX27 interact with retriever and retro - mer , respectively , two ancient evolutionary conserved endoso - mally localized complexes responsible for rescuing distinct cargoes from lysosomal degradation and routing them for recy - cling to the cell surface or other intracellular destinations 13 . Retromer consists of VPS26A or B , VPS35 and VPS29 and is recruited to endosomes by Rab7a - GTP and SNX3 14 . VPS26A / B interacts with the PDZ domain of SNX27 , which recognizes cargo proteins with PDZ - binding motifs 15 , including β 2 adrenergic receptor , the glucose transporter GLUT1 , the copper transporter ATP7A and glutamate receptors to name a few 16 – 19 . Retriever is a recently identi ﬁ ed complex composed of VPS26C ( DSCR3 ) , VPS35L ( C16orf62 ) , and VPS29 20 . Although VPS26C and VPS35L are homologous to the retromer subunits , VPS26A / B and VPS35 , respectively , only VPS26C interacts with the C - terminal tail of SNX17 . This factor in turn uses its FERM domain to couple to NPxY / NxxY motif - containing cargo proteins such as β 1 integrin , EGFR , LDLR , and LRP1 to ensure recycling back to the plasma membrane 21 – 26 . Previous studies have identi ﬁ ed that the CCC protein complex , which consists of CCDC22 , CCDC93 , and any of the 10 COMMD proteins , is required for retromer - and retriever - dependent protein traf ﬁ cking 27 – 32 . For example , CCC de ﬁ ciency in human and mouse cells causes defective recycling of SNX17 - retriever cargoes such as β 1 integrin , LDLR , and LRP1 20 , 31 , 32 . In the case of LDLR mistraf ﬁ cking , this results in hypercholester - olemia due to lower uptake of LDL - cholesterol , the LDLR ligand , which is observed in animal models of CCC de ﬁ ciency and patients with CCDC22 hypomorphic mutations 31 . The CCC complex is also essential for retromer SNX27 - dependent recycling of the ATP7A copper transporter , and as a result , CCC depletion leads to alterations of copper homeostasis in animal models , such as Bedlington terriers with a naturally occurring mutation in COMMD1 29 and humans with CCDC22 mutations 27 , 33 . Other cargoes , such as Notch receptors , are also affected upon CCC complex disturbance , but sorting recognition pathways remain unclear 34 . Although the CCC complex has been de ﬁ ned as functionally necessary for both retromer - and retriever - dependent cargoes , a distinct biochemical or adaptor activity that may underlie this activity is currently unknown . Interestingly , CCC recruitment to endosomal membranes is dependent on the pentameric Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue ( WASH ) complex 27 , a common regulator of both retromer - and retriever - dependent protein sorting 27 , 35 . Moreover , the CCC complex shows close co - evolution with the WASH complex 20 , 36 , suggest - ing that CCC may have a primary role in regulating WASH activity . WASH serves as an actin nucleation - promoting factor for the ARP2 / 3 complex , which drives the generation of branched F - actin ﬁ laments on endosomal membranes 37 – 40 . Regulation of branched F - actin formation by WASH is needed for proper morphology of the endolysosomal system and endosomal traf - ﬁ cking of a broad range of cargoes 37 , 39 , 41 – 44 , but any role for the CCC complex in this process is not currently known . Herein , we report that that the CCC complex functions as a negative regulator of WASH complex recruitment to endosomes . We ﬁ nd that this is mediated through the modulation of PI ( 3 ) P levels on endosomal membranes via recruitment of the myotubularin - related protein - 2 ( MTMR2 ) lipid phosphatase . Results De ﬁ ning the CCC and retriever interactomes . A previously published study based on protein co - elution suggested the exis - tence of a macromolecular complex of ~ 600 kDa in mass termed Commander that includes both CCC and retriever complex components , and inferred that these factors are part of a single multiprotein assembly 45 . We have previously reported that the CCC complex regulates the traf ﬁ cking of cargoes that are retrie - ver - independent , such as ATP7A , TGN46 , and CIMPR 27 , sug - gesting that CCC and retriever are functionally distinct . To try to understand if CCC and retriever are indeed separable and distinct molecular assemblies we began by de ﬁ ning the interactomes of CCC and retriever subunits , focusing on CCDC93 ( a CCC sub - unit ) and VPS26C ( a retriever component ) . First , the CCDC93 or VPS26C genes were targeted in HeLa cells using CRISPR / Cas9 , followed by re - expression of HA - tagged CCDC93 or VPS26C , respectively . HA - CCDC93 or HA - VPS26C immunoprecipitates were isolated and subjected to trypsin digestion for proteomic identi ﬁ cation by mass spectrometry ( data set available at Mas - sIVE , MSV000084217 [ https : / / massive . ucsd . edu / ProteoSAFe / dataset . jsp ? accession = MSV000084217 ] ) . Factors that were iso - lated with stoichiometries within 10 - fold from each of the baits were plotted in a Venn diagram ( Fig . 1a ) . All components of both CCC and retriever , namely all 10 COMMD proteins , CCDC22 , CCDC93 , VPS35L , VPS26C , and VPS29 , co - puri ﬁ ed with each bait . These results included an additional factor , FAM45A , which was isolated by both baits ( Fig . 1a ) . Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting con ﬁ rmed the overlapping interactions depicted in the Venn diagram ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . In addition , the binding of FAM45A to CCC and retriever subunits was con ﬁ rmed by co - immunoprecipitation of endogenous FAM45A with COMMD1 , CCDC22 , and VPS35L ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Furthermore , interaction experiments by unbiased screens in mammalian cells 46 , as well as protein – protein interaction studies in Drosophila 47 – 49 , produced interactome data that in aggregate includes all the proteins identi ﬁ ed experimentally in our mass spectrometry data , including the identi ﬁ cation of FAM45A as a CCC and retriever binding protein ( Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Fig . 1c ) .

Although these results may suggest a large single complex con - taining both CCC and retriever subunits , endogenous immuno - precipitation of the CCC complex ( by CCDC93 or CCDC22 antibodies ) led to limited or undetectable VPS26C and VPS29 co - precipitation , whereas retriever precipitation ( by VPS35L anti - bodies ) led to reliable precipitation of other retriever components ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . Thus , these data suggested that CCC and retriever are closely linked but distinct assemblies . To test this hypothesis , we used blue native ( BN ) gel separation and immu - noblotting to ascertain the size of these molecular complexes . CCC components ( COMMD1 and CCDC22 ) migrated close to 700 kDa , whereas VPS35L migrated in two complexes , one of similar mass ~ 700 kDa and one of ~ 250 kDa ( Fig . 1b ) . This smaller complex was of similar mobility as retromer ( VPS35 and VPS26A ) , and we speculated that it likely represents retriever . To examine this notion , we used VPS26C knockout and “ rescue ” cells ( used in Fig . 1a ) and observed that VPS26C is largely VPS26C CCDC93 CCDC22 FAM45A VPS26C CCDC93 COMMD2 COMMD3 VPS29 COMMD1 COMMD4 COMMD5 COMMD6 COMMD7 COMMD8 COMMD9 COMMD10 VPS35L RPL10 RPL13 RPL38 RPL7A RPL8 RPS11 RPS27L RPL79 FBLN1 JAG1LRP4 S100A4S100A10 FGB TRAF2 TRAF5 TECR CNBP CRIP1 PRSS21 WISP2 Anxa1Anxa6 RPL6 HSPG2EGFL7 CYCS a b P a r en t a l CCDC 93 C O MM D 3 VPS 35L VPS 26 C CCDC93 CCDC22 WASH VPS35L Actin FAM45A COMMD3 VPS26C CRISPR K / O : 100 1 7 58 125 134 100 10 0 24 107 89 100 108 2 7 115 121 100 93 47 3 70 119 100 24 25 4 2 124 100 179 186 14 91 2 100 152121 102 134109 65 65 F A M 45 A 15 80 30 30 65 30 c d e CCDC22 VPS35 WASH COMMD3 ( FLAG ) 12361048 720 480 242 146 66 VPS35L COMMD1 COMMD3Flag — — — — + + + + — — + + WASH HA ( VPS26C ) 12361048 720 480 242 146 66 VPS35L VPS26A CCDC22 COMMD1 HA - VPS26C + — — + — + — + — + — + 12361048 720 480 242 146 66 CCDC22 COMMD1 VPS35L WASH VPS35 VPS26A Retriever WASHcomplex Retromer CCC complex Fig . 1 CCC and retriever are closely associated but distinct complexes . a Venn diagram depicting proteins identi ﬁ ed by LC / MS - MS as interacting partners of VPS26C or CCDC93 in HeLa cells .

Moreover , the retriever complex is of slightly lower mass in VPS26C - de ﬁ cient cells compared with rescue cells , indicating that this is the main complex containing VPS26C ( Fig . 1c , VPS35L blot ) . This behavior for the smaller VPS35L - containing complex , along with its similar mass to that of retromer , indicated to us that this likely represents retriever . In contrast to these ﬁ ndings , using COMMD3 knockout and “ rescue ” cells , we found that COMMD3 loss led to the collapse of the 700 kDa complex , best noted by the change in COMMD1 mobility and the dis - appearance of a 700 kDa band of VPS35L , without the loss of the 250 kDa retriever complex ( Fig . 1d ) . Thus , we surmised that the 700 kDa complex likely represents the CCC complex and that VPS35L is a shared subunit present in both CCC and retriever . Finally , neither VPS26C or COMMD3 loss affected WASH or retromer mobility , indicating that these are separate assemblies from CCC or retriever . Examination of these complexes was complemented by evaluating the stability of various subunits upon CRIPSR / Cas9 - mediated gene deletion . Consistent with the loss of the CCC complex in COMMD3 - de ﬁ cient cells observed by BN gel electrophoresis ( Fig . 1d ) , we noted that COMMD3 deletion led to signi ﬁ cant reduction in two other CCC components , CCDC93 and CCDC22 ( Fig . 1e ) . Moreover , just as COMMD3 de ﬁ ciency had a lesser impact on retriever complex stability by BN gel electrophoresis , this corresponded to a smaller effect on VPS35L and VPS26C protein expression , as previously observed 20 , 27 . Similar ﬁ ndings were noted upon deletion of the CCC subunit CCDC93 ( Fig . 1e ) . Conversely , VPS26C and FAM45A had minimal impact on CCC or retriever subunit expression , indicating that neither protein is required for the stability of these assemblies , and in agreement with the BN gel electrophor - esis analysis of VPS26C - de ﬁ cient cells ( Fig . 1c ) . Finally , VPS35L deletion led to reduced expression of CCC subunits ( CCDC22 and COMMD3 in particular ) as well as retriever subunits ( VPS26C ) . Altogether , these results are consistent with CCC and retriever being distinct entities that share VPS35L as common subunit . CCC links retriever to WASH - containing endosomal domains . Although the data indicated that CCC and retriever are distinct complexes , the speci ﬁ c contribution of CCC to cargo traf ﬁ cking remained unclear . Previous studies relying on siRNA 20 suggested that the CCC complex is important for the recruitment of retriever to endosomes . We tested that notion by comparing VPS35L endosomal recruitment in parental HeLa cells and COMMD3 - de ﬁ cient HeLa cells that as noted above lose CCC complex assembly but retain retriever ( albeit in somewhat reduced levels ) . Interestingly , deletion of COMMD3 led to loss of VPS35L endosomal localization , in contrast to parental wild type ( WT ) HeLa , which displayed VPS35L puncta near EEA1 - and retromer - containing endosomal domains in ( Fig . 2a ) . Next , we sought to examine the mechanism by which the CCC complex might mediate retriever recruitment to endosomes . Previously , it was shown that the endosomal recruitment of the CCC complex is mediated by the WASH complex subunit FAM21 through direct interactions with CCDC93 27 . Given the loss of endosomal localization of VPS35L in COMMD3 - de ﬁ cient cells , we hypo - thesized that retriever localization would be dependent on WASH complex interactions mediated by the CCC complex . Using COMMD3 - de ﬁ cient and “ rescue ” cells , we immunoprecipitated VPS35L and examined its interaction with the WASH complex . Consistent with the hypothesis , VPS35L binding to WASH was dependent on COMMD3 expression and was absent in COMMD3 - de ﬁ cient cells ( Fig . 2b ) . Taken together , these data indicate that the CCC complex provides a link between the retriever and WASH complexes , and this link is required for endosomal recruitment of retriever . CCC loss leads to retriever - independent recycling defects . If the sole function of the CCC complex is to link retriever to endo - somes , it would be predicted that its de ﬁ ciency should phenocopy retriever loss . However , according to prior studies 27 , 34 , a number of retriever - independent cargos were found to also be mis - localized upon silencing of selective CCC complex subunits . Using HeLa cells generated through CRISPR / Cas9 genome edit - ing , we examined the traf ﬁ cking of a retromer cargo protein , GLUT1 , in CCC - de ﬁ cient ( COMMD3 and CCDC93 ) , retriever - de ﬁ cient ( VPS35L , VPS26C ) , and FAM45A - de ﬁ cient cells . Dele - tion of CCC , VPS35L and FAM45A , resulted in a pronounced accumulation of GLUT1 in early endosomes , consistent with the notion that the CCC complex has broader functions than retriever regulation ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Only VPS26C deletion had no effect on GLUT1 traf ﬁ cking , in line with the preservation of CCC in these cells and the previous report that VPS26C does not regulate traf ﬁ cking of SNX27 - dependent cargoes , like GLUT1 20 . Next , we analyzed in detail the mechanisms of mistraf ﬁ cking of integrin β 1 ( ITG β 1 ) , a retriever cargo , also sensitive to CCC complex depletion 20 – 22 . McNally and coauthors had reported that upon transient knockdown of CCDC22 , CCDC93 and VPS35L , integrin α 5 / β 1 surface levels are decreased and the protein is routed for lysosomal degradation 20 . First , we examined ITG β 1 recycling in a panel of HeLa knockout cell lines de ﬁ cient in CCC , retriever or FAM45A . In this assay , where the plasma membrane pool of ITG β 1 is labeled and its localization monitored over time , ITG β 1 was predominantly at the plasma membrane in WT HeLa cells ( 1 h after initial labeling ) . In contrast , deletion of CCC ( COMMD3 , CCDC93 ) , VPS35L and VPS26C led to pronounced accumulation of ITG β 1 on WASH - positive intracellular vesicles ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . Inter - estingly , FAM45A did not affect traf ﬁ cking of this receptor . In line with further mistraf ﬁ cking to lysosomes , ITG β 1 protein levels were reduced in every instance when endosomal trapping was observed , and these reduced levels were restored upon treatment with the lysosome protease inhibitor Ba ﬁ lomycin A ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 2c ) . The accumulation of ITG β 1 on WASH - positive vesicles in CCC knockout cells was not due to increased endocytosis , which appeared unaffected ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) , but due to defective endosomal recycling ( Supplementary Fig . 2e , f ) . Taken together , these data indicate that the CCC complex can regulate endosomal recycling of both retromer - and retriever - dependent cargoes . CCC depletion results in F - actin accumulation on endosomes . Components of the CCC complex are highly conserved and demonstrate strong co - evolution with the WASH complex 20 , 36 , suggesting a regulatory role in WASH activity . This possibility , along with the observed broad repercussions of CCC loss on protein recycling , led us to investigate whether CCC might reg - ulate WASH complex activity . First , we assessed endosomal F - actin in CCC - and retriever - de ﬁ cient cells using ﬂ uorescently labeled phalloidin ( Fig . 3a ) . The staining revealed accumulation of F - actin on WASH - positive endosomal foci in CCDC93 , COMMD3 , and VPS35L KO cells , but not in VPS26C and FAM45A KO cells ( Fig . 3b ) . Signi ﬁ cantly , Commd1 - de ﬁ cient mouse embryonic ﬁ broblasts and ﬁ broblasts derived from a patient with a CCDC22 hypomorphic mutation ( CCDC22 p . T17A ) also showed increased F - actin accumulation on endo - somes ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) . We also observed accumula - tion of cortactin , an ARP2 / 3 complex and F - actin - stabilizing ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12221 - 6 4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 4271 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12221 - 6 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications protein , on FAM21 - positive vesicles in CCC - de ﬁ cient HeLa cells ( Fig . 3c , d ) . Closer observation of actin endosomal structures in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells revealed the presence of WASH , FAM21 , and VPS35 at the tips of cortactin tails , and ITG α 5 with FAM21 at the tips of F - actin tails ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . Similar F - actin - containing structures have been observed in cells when WASH activity was increased 50 . We next asked whether F - actin accumulation on endosomes in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells was WASH - dependent . To that end , we assessed endosomal F - actin in CCDC93 KO cells and found that depletion of WASH ( shWASH ) led to near complete loss of F - actin on endosomes of these cells , whereas the CCDC93 - de ﬁ cient cell line infected with a control shRNA lentivirus continued to show enhanced F - actin accumulation on endosomes , ( Fig . 3e , f ) . Taken together , these data indicate that CCC , but not retriever , negatively regulates WASH - dependent endosomal F - actin accu - mulation . Once again , VPS35L behaved functionally as other components of the CCC complex . CCC depletion results in increased WASH complex activation . To ascertain the mechanism of endosomal F - actin in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells , we looked at WASH distribution in both CCC - and retriever - de ﬁ cient cells . Immuno ﬂ uorescence revealed that endosomal - associated WASH levels were increased in CCDC93 , COMMD3 , and VPS35L KO , but not in VPS26C KO and c d H eLa W T C C D C 93 K O C O M M D 3 K O V P S 35L K O V P S 26 C K O F A M 45 A K O 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 P ea r s on ’ s c o rr e l a t i on c oe ff i c i en t ( r ) EEA 1 and G L U T 1 * * * GLUT1 EEA1 a C O MM D 3 K O H eLa W T VPS35 / 35L / EEA1 VPS35L VPS35L / EEA1 VPS35L / VPS35 b VPS35L KO VPS26C KO FAM45A KO HeLa WT CCDC93 KO COMMD3 KO WASH VPS35L Actin C O MM D 3 K O C O MM D 3 r e sc ue I g G I P VPS 35L I P I g G I P VPS 35L I P INPUT COMMD3 KO COMMD3 rescue COMMD3 ( Flag ) 65 80 25 50 Fig . 2 CCC links retriever to endosomes but its loss affects retriever - independent cargoes . a Confocal images from VPS35L , EEA1 , and VPS35 immuno ﬂ uorescence staining depicting the subcellular localization of the retriever subunit VPS35L in the indicated cell lines .

Interestingly , compared with control cells , WASH - positive vesicles in CCDC93 − , COMMD3 − , and VPS35L - de ﬁ cient cells appeared substantially enlarged and accumulated in a tighter perinuclear area ( Fig . 4b ) , thus resulting in a smaller area of the cytosol being occupied by WASH - positive vesicles ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) .

Interestingly , WASH complex assembly seemed unaffected as co - precipitation of FAM21 with other components of this complex was indis - tinguishable between control and shCommd1 cells ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 4d ) , in agreement with the unaffected mobility of the WASH complex in CCC - and retriever - de ﬁ cient cells ( Fig . 1c , d ) . Consistent with the increased nucleating activity , we found that CCC - de ﬁ cient cells displayed increased Arp2 / 3 recruitment to retromer - positive vesicles , as demonstrated by staining for the Arp2 / 3 subunit ARPC2 ( Fig . 4f , g ) . Moreover , ARPC2 foci were substantially larger in COMMD3 - de ﬁ cient cells , where they still contained internalized ITG α 5 , which in control conditions was not trapped on endosomes ( Supplementary Fig . 4e ) . Altogether , our data indicate that the CCC complex functions as a negative regulator of WASH - dependent F - actin deposition , and suggests that this negative regulation is required for optimal cargo sorting from endosomes . CCC de ﬁ ciency results in endosomal accumulation of PI ( 3 ) P . Phosphoinositide ( PI ) levels are tightly regulated and play an essential role in vesicular budding , membrane fusion , and cytoskeleton organization 51 , 52 . In fact , increases in several PI species have been associated with the accumulation of endosomal F - actin 9 , 50 , 53 , 54 , which prompted us to investigate whether PI metabolism was impaired in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells . As PI ( 3 ) P plays a central role in endosomal recruitment of effector proteins , such as early endosomal antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) , we assessed the levels of endosomally localized EEA1 in CCC - and retriever - de ﬁ cient cells . Interestingly , endosomal EEA1 levels were signi ﬁ cantly elevated in CCDC93 and COMMD3 KO cells , and only slightly elevated in VPS26C KO cells ( Fig . 5a , b and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) , a result that correlated with WASH levels on EEA1 - positive endosomes in these cells ( Fig . 5c ) . To determine if PI ( 3 ) P levels were elevated on endosomes in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells , we transfected cells with a vector expressing a PI ( 3 ) P reporter protein consisting of a fusion between dsRed and the FYVE - domain from EEA1 . The PI ( 3 ) P reporter signal revealed a ~ 2 . 5 - fold increase in PI ( 3 ) P levels in endosomes from COMMD3 and CCDC93 KO cells , which was not seen in VPS26C KO cells ( Fig . 5d , e ) . In order to more quantitatively measure levels of PI ( 3 ) P and other PIP species , we performed HPLC in control and COMMD3 - de ﬁ cient cells . As shown in Fig . 5f , COMMD3 de ﬁ ciency resulted in a ~ 3 . 2 - fold increase in total PI ( 3 ) P levels ; other PIs were also elevated but to a lesser extent ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Taken together , these data indicate that CCC de ﬁ ciency , but not retriever de ﬁ ciency , alters speci ﬁ c PI lipids and has the largest impact on endosomal PI ( 3 ) P levels . VPS34 blockade reverts endosomal phenotypes of CCC depletion . The above data indicate that CCC complex de ﬁ ciency results in abnormally high levels of PI ( 3 ) P on endosomes . To test if this alteration is linked to WASH recruitment and receptor traf ﬁ cking , we tested whether pharmacologic inhibition of VPS34 , the main lipid kinase involved in the generation of endosomal PI ( 3 ) P 2 – 4 , could rescue the effects induced by CCC complex loss . Indeed , chemical inhibition of VPS34 using a highly speci ﬁ c VPS34 inhibitor ( VPS34 - IN1 ) 55 reduced the PI ( 3 ) P reporter signal in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells ( Fig . 6a , b ) . Moreover , VPS34 inhibition signi ﬁ cantly reduced endosomal EEA1 and WASH complex recruitment , and prevented excessive endosomal F - actin accumulation in CCDC93 and COMMD3 KO cells ( Fig . 6c and Supplementary Fig . 6a – c ) . To ensure that these results were not due to unintended off - target effects of the VPS34 inhibitor , we used three independent VPS34 siRNAs ( Supplementary Fig . 6d ) . Once more , siRNA depletion of VPS34 in COMMD3 - de ﬁ cient cells diminished endosomal WASH recruitment and most sig - ni ﬁ cantly , this largely eliminated the endosomal trapping of internalized ITG α 5 ( Fig . 6d – f ) . In addition , VPS34 silencing in COMMD3 - de ﬁ cient led to partial restoration of endosomal morphology and increased the cellular area of WASH - positive vesicles ( Supplementary Fig . 6e ) . These results indicate that in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells , elevated WASH recruitment to endosomal structures , and its downstream consequences including increased F - actin generation and mistraf ﬁ cking of receptors , are dependent on PI ( 3 ) P accumulation . The PI ( 3 ) P phosphatase MTMR2 is regulated by the CCC complex . The increase in endosomal PI ( 3 ) P levels in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells could be caused by either increased VPS34 activity , decreased conversion of PI ( 3 ) P into PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( defective PIKfyve kinase activity ) , or by lower rates of dephosphorylation of PI ( 3 ) P back into PI by myotubularins phosphatases . Using an ELISA - based in vitro kinase reaction , we found that VPS34 immuno - precipitated from CCC - de ﬁ cient cells was not signi ﬁ cantly more active compared to control cells ( Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . Moreover , CCC de ﬁ ciency did not impact the interaction of Beclin1 with VPS34 and ATG14 , which are additional compo - nents of the VPS34 kinase complex ( Supplementary Fig . 7c ) . These data suggest that VPS34 activity is unchanged in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells . Further , PIKfyve activity seemed intact as con - version of PI3P into PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells was not impaired judging by the noted increase in PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( Supple - mentary Fig . 5b ) . As VPS34 activity did not appear to be increased in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells , we focused our attention on PI ( 3 ) P phosphatases , speci ﬁ cally myotubularins 56 , which also regulate PI ( 3 ) P levels . Recently , two independent high - throughput proteomics screens identi ﬁ ed that MTMR2 may interact with CCDC22 46 , 57 . We examined the possibility of a CCDC22 interaction with MTMR2 by co - immunoprecipitation experiments . First , we performed immunoprecipitation of endogenous CCDC22 and found that it readily co - immunoprecipitated HA - tagged MTMR2 ( Fig . 7a ) . Furthermore , immunoprecipitation of endogenous CCDC22 also led to the recovery of endogenous MTMR2 ( Fig . 7b ) . Closer examination of the interaction , indicated that a central region in CCDC22 ( amino acids 321 – 447 ) , preceding the C - terminal coil - coiled domain in this protein , is both necessary and suf ﬁ cient for its interaction with MTMR2 ( Fig . 7c ) . Interestingly , this region does not bind to COMMD1 and thus does not support CCC complex assembly , indicating that the binding between CCDC22 and MTMR2 does not require a fully assembled CCC complex . Conversely , we found that full - length MTMR2 is required for its interaction with CCDC22 and no single domain was able to recapitulate binding ( Supplementary Fig . 8a ) . Next , we examined whether MTMR2 knockdown could mimic the endosomal phenotypes observed in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells . MTMR2 knockdown led to pronounced accumulation of GLUT1 on EEA1 - positive endosomes compared with control siRNA - transfected cells ( Supplementary Fig . 8b – d ) . Further , a signi ﬁ cant accumulation of FAM21 and F - actin on endosomes was seen in MTMR2 - de ﬁ cient cells , akin to the phenotype of CCC de ﬁ ciency ( Fig . 7d , Supplementary Fig . 8e ) . Most importantly , MTMR2 si - lencing also led to defective endosomal recycling of ITG β 1 , and associated WASH accumulation on endosomes , both of which were reversed by inhibition of PI ( 3 ) P synthesis ( Fig . 7e , Supplementary Fig . 8f ) . Thus , our data indicated that MTMR2 not only interacts with the CCC complex but its de ﬁ ciency phenocopies the endosomal - recycling defect seen in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells .

Phosphorylation of MTMR2 on serine 58 has a profound effect on its cellular localization , preventing its recruitment to endosomes 58 . This residue is preceded by phenylalanine and upon phosphorylation may be recognized by a phosphoserine antibody raised against this motif ( phosphoserine preceded by tyrosine , phenylalanine , or trypto - phan ) . Thus , to investigate the phosphorylation status of MTMR2 , we immunoprecipitated the protein and immuno - blotted the resulting material with this speci ﬁ c phosphoserine antibody . We observed that COMMD1 - de ﬁ cient HEK293T cells ( which display exaggerated WASH complex activity , Supplemen - tary Fig . 4b , c ) , had marked elevation in phosphorylated MTMR2 ( Fig . 7f ) , a form of the protein that has been previously shown to be unable to bind to endosomes 58 . To investigate if defective MTMR2 recruitment to endosomes is responsible for the phenotype resulting from COMMD3 de ﬁ ciency , we expressed a d b EEA1 * * * c e f FYVE FYVE WASH H eLa W T CCDC 93 K O C O MM D 3 K O VPS 26 C K O H eLa W T C C D C 93 K O C O M M D 3 K O V P S 26 C K O 0 2 4 6 8 EEA1 WASH H eLa W T CCDC 93 K O C O MM D 3 K O VPS 26 C K O * * * N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en t i n t en s i t y PI3P reporter ( FYVE ) PI3P WASH H eLa W T C C D C 93 K O C O M M D 3 K O V P S 26 C K O 0 1 2 3 4 5 N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en t i n t en s i t y on EEA 1 - po s i t i v e endo s o m e s H eLa W T C C D C 93 K O C O M M D 3 K O V P S 26 C K O 0 1 2 3 4 5 N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en t i n t en s i t y on EEA 1 - po s i t i v e endo s o m e s H eLa W T C O M M D 3 K O 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 % t o t a l P I * * * * * * ns * * * * * * ns NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12221 - 6 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 4271 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12221 - 6 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 9 HA - tagged MTMR2 wild type ( WT ) or phosphorylation - resistant mutant ( S58A ) . As seen by others , MTMR2 S58A localized almost exclusively to endosomes , whereas the WT protein was largely cytosolic and its presence in endosomes was hard to detect by imaging in WT cells ( Fig . 7g , top row ) , probably indicative that small amounts of this enzyme are ever recruited to these structures under physiologic conditions . Importantly , endoso - mally localized MTMR2 S58A was able to rescue the accumula - tion of endosomal F - actin noted in COMMD3 - de ﬁ cient cells ( Fig . 7g , bottom row , Fig . 7h ) . In aggregate , the data indicate that the CCC complex regulates MTMR2 phosphorylation , a key step in its recruitment to endosomes , and that MTMR2 perturbations results in endosomal phenotypes that correspond to the functional outcomes observed upon deletion of CCC complex subunits . Discussion The CCC complex is a molecular assembly that has been recog - nized for its role in regulating endosomal recycling of various cargos 20 , 27 , 30 – 32 , 34 , which as shown here , involve both retromer and retriever pathways . However , the mechanism by which the CCC complex modulates endosomal protein traf ﬁ cking remained unclear . The present study provides a detailed mechanistic ana - lysis of this question and uncovered that the CCC complex modulates WASH recruitment and activity by regulating PI ( 3 ) P levels on endosomal membranes through the PI ( 3 ) P phosphatase MTMR2 ( Fig . 7i ) . Consistent with prior work , we found that CCC complex subunits interact with components of retriever , a complex that is structurally analogous to retromer . Both retromer and retriever are trimeric assemblies that share one common subunit ( VPS29 ) , and can utilize speci ﬁ c SNX proteins to identify cargo in the endosomal compartment 14 , 15 , 20 . Although some have suggested that CCC and retriever represent one large multiprotein complex termed Commander 59 , data presented here indicate that the CCC complex and retriever are two separable assemblies of different sizes ( ~ 700 kDa and 250 kDa , respectively ) , which share VPS35L as a common subunit . Interestingly , in cell lysates both retriever and retromer have similar mobility , which in both cases is larger than the predicted trimeric assembly of their principal subunits , predicted at ~ 150 – 170 kDa . In addition , we ﬁ nd that CCC and retriever have different functional roles as exempli ﬁ ed by the endosomal phenotypes observed upon selective gene deletion . In this regard , altered endosomal morphology , F - actin , and WASH accumulation , as well as PI ( 3 ) P accumulation , are unique to CCC complex deletion and not seen in VPS26C - or FAM45A - deleted cell lines . Inter - estingly , VPS35L deletion shares properties with CCC - de ﬁ cient states consistent with its presence in both retriever and the CCC complexes . Moreover , our data indicate that the CCC complex , through the direct interaction between CCDC93 and FAM21 , provides a link between retriever and the WASH complex , which is required for endosomal recruitment ( Fig . 7i ) . Another ﬁ nding in this study is that FAM45A , a DENN - domain containing pro - tein of unknown function , binds to CCC and retriever , in agreement with high - throughput protein – protein interaction studies 46 , 60 . The role of FAM45A in endosomal sorting is still unknown : while it lacks the ability of the CCC complex to reg - ulate endosomal F - actin accumulation ( suggesting that it prob - ably does not regulate PI ( 3 ) P levels ) , it seems to have a more - signi ﬁ cant effect on retromer - mediated recycling . Evolutionary conservation analysis indicates that CCC subunits co - evolved with the WASH complex 20 , 36 , and our data suggest that this occurred in order to regulate the endosomal recruitment and activity of this actin - nucleating factor . WASH is recruited to endosomes where it is necessary for branched F - actin deposition , a process that is essential to maintain the structure of the endo - lysosomal network , to promote effective ﬁ ssion of membrane tubules and traf ﬁ cking of cargo proteins 37 , 39 , 41 , 43 , 44 . Importantly , we ﬁ nd that the CCC complex functions as a negative regulator of WASH , highlighting that excess endosomal F - actin accumulation is detrimental to endosomal cargo recycling . The increased endosomal recruitment of the WASH complex in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells is directly correlated to an increased activity state for this complex , and to F - actin accumulation . This result is in agreement with the previously published proteomics data showing that WASH levels are increased in hepatocytes from Commd1 and Commd6 tissue - speci ﬁ c knockout mice that show defective LDLR recycling 32 . Furthermore , they are in agreement with a recent study that identi ﬁ ed a number of alterations in cytoskeletal structure in COMMD5 - de ﬁ cient cells 61 . Altogether these data suggest that the enhanced endosomal accumulation of WASH in CCC - de ﬁ cient states is physiologically detrimental . Our studies indicate that WASH complex hyper - recruitment and activation , seen in CCC de ﬁ ciency , occur as a result of endosomal PI ( 3 ) P accumulation . This ﬁ nding adds another dimension to the importance of PI ( 3 ) P regulation on endosomes , as our data uncovered that PI ( 3 ) P turnover is necessary for the loss of WASH complex from endosomes and the termination of F - actin nucleation , without which the sorting and recycling processes do not progress normally . The precise mechanisms by which endosomal PI ( 3 ) P is involved in the recruitment and / or activation of the WASH complex remain to be fully elucidated . However , it should be noted that FAM21 has two basic regions within its extended C - terminal tail that have been shown to interact with PI ( 3 ) P and other PIs 40 , and several WASP family members including WASP / N - WASP , WAVE proteins , and WHAMM , all contain PIP - interacting motifs that impact their localization and activation state 62 – 66 . As far as the mechanism for PI ( 3 ) P accumulation in CCC - de ﬁ cient states , the aggregate of the data included here indicate that the main defect is in PI ( 3 ) P conversion to PI owing to Fig . 5 PI ( 3 ) P levels are increased in CCC - de ﬁ cient cells . a Confocal microscopy imaging from EEA1 and WASH immuno ﬂ uorescence staining in the indicated cell lines , corresponding to b and c .

It should be noted that inhibition of PIKfyve kinase activity , which prevents PI ( 3 ) P conversion to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 can also result in increased F - actin on endosomes 53 . However , as PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 levels were not decreased but rather modestly increased in COMMD3 - de ﬁ cient cells , a defect in PIKfyve activity could not explain the increased PI ( 3 ) P levels observed . Hypomorphic MTMR2 mutations are linked to Charcot – Marie – Tooth syndrome , an inherited form of peripheral neuropathy in humans . However , the spectrum of defects seen with CCC de ﬁ ciency are far more profound , including neurologic disability and cardiovascular congenital anomalies 67 , suggesting that the CCC complex likely mediates other critical events in addition to MTMR2 regulation . This is in line with the multi - subunit architecture of the CCC complex and the evolutionary conservation of all 10 COMMD protein family members .

Recent structural studies 68 have shed light into the assembly of COMMD com - plexes and con ﬁ rmed the importance of the COMM domain in the dimerization of these proteins 28 . Furthermore , these studies suggest that higher order COMMD hexamers may be possible through additional interactions via their shared helical N - terminal domains . The contribution to the function of the CCC complex that COMMD protein assemblies may provide remains to be evaluated . In conclusion , we provide evidence that the CCC complex is a negative regulator of WASH activity through its ability to mod - ulate endosomal PI ( 3 ) P levels . Future studies aimed at under - standing how CCC controls MTMR2 phosphorylation and how PI ( 3 ) P impacts WASH complex recruitment and activation , will provide further insight into how deregulation of the CCC com - plex contributes to cellular physiology and human disease . Methods Cell culture . HEK293T and HeLa cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA ) . Previously reported ﬁ broblast lines used here include embryo ﬁ broblasts from Commd1 ﬂ oxed mice 31 , embryo ﬁ broblasts from Wash1 ﬂ oxed mice reconstituted with stable expression of HA - GFP - WASH 39 , and dermal ﬁ broblasts from patients with the CCDC22 p .

To assess the dynamics of the recycling , cells were incubated at 37 °C in serum - free DMEM containing 10 μ g / mL anti - integrin - β 1 antibody for 30min , and cell surface antibody was then stripped ( PBS , pH 2 . 5 ) . Subsequently , cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then ﬁ xed and processed for imaging . Image quanti ﬁ cation . Fluorescence signal values were quanti ﬁ ed using Fiji ( ImageJ , NIH ) . Data were processed with Excel ( Microsoft ) and plotted with Prism6 ( GraphPad ) . Each dot represents the value from a single cell ; the horizontal bar in these graphs represents the mean and the error bars correspond to the standard error of the mean ( SEM ) . In all quanti ﬁ cation experiments , the data were normalized by dividing the mean ﬂ uorescence intensity ( MFI ) values of the experimental samples compared with the average mean ﬂ uorescence intensity of control cells to derive relative ﬂ uorescence intensities ( expressed as fold ) . Pearson ’ s correlation coef ﬁ cient was measured using Colocalization Threshold Fiji Plugin within manually outlined regions of interest ( ROIs ) . WASH ﬂ uorescence was used to de ﬁ ne ROI for Pearson ’ s correlation coef ﬁ cient between WASH and ITG β 1 , EEA1 for Pearson ’ s correlation coef ﬁ cient between GLUT1 and EEA1 , FAM21 for Pearson ’ s correlation coef ﬁ cient between FAM21 and MTMR2 . For the quanti ﬁ cation of actin on WASH - positive vesicles , WASH ﬂ uorescence was used to manually de ﬁ ne the ROI . The mean ﬂ uorescence intensity of WASH within the ROI , and the ROI area was then measured . A similar approach was used for the measurement of cortactin on FAM21 - positive vesicles ( FAM21 ﬂ uorescence was used to de ﬁ ne the ROI ) , ITG α 5 and ITG β 1 on WASH - positive vesicles ( WASH ﬂ uorescence was used to manually de ﬁ ne the ROI ) . For all the above measurements the MFI values were corrected for the ROI area . For the quanti ﬁ cation of ARPC2 on VPS35 - positive vesicles ( VPS35 ﬂ uorescence was used to de ﬁ ne the ROI ) , WASH , EEA1 , and actin on EEA1 - positive vesicles ( EEA1 ﬂ uorescence was used to de ﬁ ne the ROI ) , actin on FAM21 - positive vesicles ( FAM21 ﬂ uorescence was used to de ﬁ ne the ROI ) , ITG β 1 on WASH - positive vesicles in si - MTMR2 - treated cells ( WASH ﬂ uorescence was used to manually de ﬁ ne the ROI ) , the squares of the same size were set as ROIs , and values were measured within the same area . For the quanti ﬁ cation of the FYVE ﬂ uorescence reporter , a region covering the entire cell was manually selected ( ROI ) , and FYVE mean ﬂ uorescence pixel intensity in the ROI was calculated . Quantitative real - time PCR . Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Trizol method ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol . Isolated RNA was subjected to quantitative RT - PCR using the SYBR green and the relative quanti ﬁ cation of target transcripts was normalized to the housekeeping gene 18 S ribosomal RNA . The following primer sequences were used for MTMR2 ; Sense ( 5 ′ - AAGTATTCCCTGAAAATGGGTGG - 3 ′ ) and Antisense ( 5 ′ - AAACTGGGAT ACGGCCTCTTG - 3 ′ ) . Blue native electrophoresis and immunoblotting . Cell lysates were prepared using NativePAGE Sample Prep kit ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . In brief , the cells were lysed on ice for 10 mins in 1× sample buffer containing 1 % Digitonin and Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail followed by spin at 20 , 000× g for 30mins . Protein concentration was determined in the lysate using Biorad protein assay reagent . According to manufacturer ’ s instructions , equal amounts of protein were loaded to NativePAGE 3 – 12 % Bis - Tris protein gels , with one lane containing NativeMark Unstained protein standard and transblotted to PVDF membranes . After transfer , the proteins were ﬁ xed by incubating the membrane in 8 % acetic acid for 15mins , followed by immunoblotting as described above . Protein af ﬁ nity puri ﬁ cation and proteomics . CCDC93 and VPS26C knockout HeLa cells generated by CRISPR / Cas9 as detailed above were reconstituted with either HA empty vector ( control sample ) or HA - tagged CCDC93 and VPS26C , respectively ( experimental samples ) , using the lentivirus system and subjected to negative selection . HA - , HA - CCDC93 - , and HA - VPS26C - transduced knockout cells were grown in large batches and lysed in Triton - X lysis buffer . Cell lysates were cleared and equal amounts of protein were then added to HA - resin to capture HA - tagged proteins . HA beads were washed using high stringency buffer ( Triton - X lysis buffer supplemented to a total of 350 m M NaCl ) and proteins were eluted using HA peptide ( 1 mg / mL ) . Trichloroacetic acid precipitation was performed on the eluted material and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 3 × LDS sample buffer with DTT . Short electrophoresis was performed to allow proteins to enter the upper portion of the gel , followed by coomassie gel staining and excision of gel slices from each sample ( control , HA - CCDC93 , HA - VPS26C , n = 1 for each group ) . Protein gel pieces were reduced and alkylated with DTT ( 20 m M ) and iodoacetamide ( 27 . 5 m M ) . A 0 . 1 µg / µL solution of trypsin in 50m M triethy - lammonium bicarbonate ( TEAB ) was added to completely cover the gel , allowed to sit on ice , and then 50 µL of 50 m M TEAB was added and the gel pieces were digested overnight ( Pierce ) . Following solid - phase extraction cleanup with an Oasis MCX µelution plate ( Waters ) , the resulting peptides were reconstituted in 10 µL of 2 % ( v / v ) acetonitrile ( ACN ) and 0 . 1 % tri ﬂ uoroacetic acid in water : 2µL were injected onto an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer ( Thermo Electron ) coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLC - Nano liquid chromatography system ( Dionex ) . Samples were injected onto a 75 μ m i . d . , 50 - cm long EasySpray column ( Thermo ) , and eluted with a gradient from 0 to 28 % buffer B over 60 mins . Buffer A contained 2 % ( v / v ) ACN and 0 . 1 % formic acid in water , and buffer B contained 80 % ( v / v ) ACN , 10 % ( v / v ) tri ﬂ uoroethanol , and 0 . 1 % formic acid in water . The mass spec - trometer operated in positive ion mode with a source voltage of 2 . 4kV and an ion transfer tube temperature of 275°C . MS scans were acquired at 120 , 000 resolution in the Orbitrap and up to 10 MS / MS spectra were obtained in the ion trap for each full spectrum acquired using higher - energy collisional dissociation for ions with charges 2 – 7 . Dynamic exclusion was set for 25 s after an ion was selected for fragmentation . Raw MS data ﬁ les were converted to a peak list format and analyzed using the central proteomics facilities pipeline ( CPFP ) , version 2 . 0 . 3 . Peptide identi ﬁ cation was performed using the X ! Tandem and open MS search algorithm ( OMSSA ) search engines against the human protein database from Uniprot ( Release August 2014 ) , with common contaminants and reversed decoy sequences appended . Fragment and precursor tolerances of 20 ppm and 0 . 5 Da were speci ﬁ ed , and three missed cleavages of trypsin ( cleavage after K or R except KP / RP ) were allowed . Carbamidomethylation of Cys was set as a ﬁ xed modi ﬁ cation , with oxidation of Met set as a variable modi ﬁ cation . An additional requirement of two unique peptide sequences per protein was used for protein identi ﬁ cation . Both protein and peptide FDR were set to 1 % . Using the spectral index as a semi - quantitative indication of protein abundance , we calculated enrichment ratios as the ration of any given protein in the experimental samples ( HA - CCDC93 and HA - VPS26C ) compared with the empty vector control . As a cutoff , proteins with a minimum enrichment of 10 - fold and whose spectral indexes were within one order of magnitude of the spectral index of the bait were selected as putative interacting proteins .

Protein baits were de ﬁ ned as those identi ﬁ ed as common partners of CCDC93 and VPS26C that had been experi - mentally de ﬁ ned by mass spectrometry ( Venn diagram shown in Fig . 1a ) . For each of these factors , we tabulated all reported interacting partners in Bioplex 2 . 0 46 . In addition , we used Homologene and Blast to identify potential homologs in Dro - sophila . Interacting partners in Drosophila melanogaster were identi ﬁ ed in NCBI Gene , which collates data from three prior interactome studies 47 – 49 . For each reported interacting partner , mammalian homologs of Drosophila genes were again de ﬁ ned as above ( Homologene and Blast ) . Finally , the number of times that any interacting partner was identi ﬁ ed was tabulated and normalized by the maximum theoretical occurrences in the examined gene matrix , which is presented in the form of percentage . Pyrene - actin assembly assays . WASH knockout mouse embryonic ﬁ broblasts reconstituted with HA - GFP - WASH or HEK293T cells were stably transfected with shControl or shCommd1 lentiviral expression vectors , targeting mouse of human COMMD1 , respectively . In vitro actin assembly on beads using cell lysates was performed . Cells were lysed in NP - 40 lysis buffer ( 50 m M Tris Cl pH 7 . 7 , 150 m M NaCl , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 2 m M MgCl 2 and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail ) . Lysate protein concentrations were measured and equal amounts of protein was used to immu - noprecipitate the WASH complex using HA antibodies in the case of murine cells expressing HA - GFP - WASH , or FAM21 antibodies in the case of HEK293T cells . The antibodies were precipitated by protein G beads , which were washed with NP - 40 lysis buffer containing 2m M MgCl 2 . Actin assembly assays were set up by incubating beads with 4 μ M actin and 10n M Arp2 / 3 complex in KMEI buffer ( 15 % ( w / v ) glycerol , 50m M KCl , 1m M MgCl 2 , 1m M EGTA , and 10 m M imidazole ; pH 7 . 0 ) for 1h at room temperature .
