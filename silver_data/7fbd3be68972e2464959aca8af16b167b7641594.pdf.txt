They are involved in essential processes in the cytoplasm and have also nuclear functions . Malaria parasites ( Plasmodium spp . ) have two actin isoforms that differ from each other and from canonical actins in structure and filament - forming properties . Actin I has an essential role in motility and is fairly well characterized . The structure and function of actin II are not as well understood , but mutational analyses have revealed two essential functions in male gametogenesis and in the zygote . Here , we present expression analysis , high - resolution filament structures , and biochemical characterization of Plasmodium actin II . We show that it is expressed in male gametocytes and zygotes and associated with the nucleus in both stages in filament - like structures . Unlike actin I , actin II readily forms long filaments in vitro , and near - atomic structures in the presence or absence of jasplakinolide reveal very similar structures . Small but significant differences compared to other actins in the openness and twist , the active site , the D - loop , and the plug region contribute to filament stability . Mutational analyses suggest that long and stable filaments are necessary for male gametogenesis , while the second function in the zygote stage also requires fine - tuned regulation by methylation of histidine 73 . Actin II polymerizes via the classical nucleation - elongation mechanism and has a critical concentration of ~ 0 . 1 μM at the steady - state , like actin I and canonical actins . Similarly to actin I , dimers are a stable form of actin II at equilibrium . Significance statement Malaria is a parasitic infection caused by Plasmodium spp . , which belong to the phylum Apicomplexa . In 2020 , approximately 627000 people died from nearly 241 million malaria cases registered worldwide . In contrast to other apicomplexan parasites , Plasmodium spp . encode two actin isoforms . While actin I is part of the glideosome complex , essential for locomotion , actin II is present in the mosquito stages , where it has functions in gametogenesis and in the zygote . The exact function of actin II is still unclear , and information at the molecular level is limited . We show here that actin II is associated with the nucleus in gametocytes and zygotes and performs specific functions requiring both long filaments and fine - tuning by methylation of histidine 73 .

This group includes Plasmodium spp . , well known as causative agents of human malaria , as well as several parasites responsible for diseases in other animals of socioeconomic importance [ 2 ] . The life cycle of malaria parasites involves several stages that go through different morphological states and infect different cell types in the mosquito and the vertebrate host . Actin filaments are essential for parasite growth , development , motility , and host cell invasion [ 3 , 4 ] . Unlike other apicomplexan parasites , including Toxoplasma gondii , which have only a single actin isoform , there are two actin isoforms ( actin I and actin II ) in Plasmodium . Especially actin II is one of the most divergent actins among eukaryotes [ 5 ] . Plasmodium falciparum actin I shares 82 - 83 % and actin II only 76 - 77 % of common sequence with canonical actins from opisthokonts . The two actin isoforms have 79 % sequence identity with each other [ 6 ] . While the function of actin I in motility has been intensively studied , less is known about the functions of actin II , which is specific for gametogenesis and insect stages [ 7 , 8 ] . Mutants lacking actin II have a pleiotropic phenotype during the mosquito stages . Actin II is necessary for egress of the male gametocyte ( microgametocyte ) from the red blood cell and is strictly required for exflagellation of male gametes [ 8 ] . In the mutants , motile ookinetes are normally formed , but the protein has a role in the female gamete or zygote that manifests itself as a block of oocyst development in the absence of actin II . Complementation of an actin II deletion mutant with actin I resulted in poor restoration of exflagellation . Some ookinetes were recovered , and these traversed the midgut epithelium and formed oocysts , which however did not develop [ 7 ] . Furthermore , complementation of the deletion mutant with a gene expressing an actin I chimera , where the DNase I - binding ( D - ) loop in subdomain 2 was replaced by muscle actin , restored exflagellation [ 5 ] . The biological functions of actins are dependent on transitions between the globular G - form and the filamentous F - form , which are tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis [ 9 , 10 ] . The structure of monomeric G - actin is well known ; there are almost 200 crystal structures available in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) . In contrast , structural data on F - form actin has .

During the last years , advances in single - particle electron cryo - microscopy ( cryo - EM ) have enabled determining high - resolution structures of F - actin from different organisms , such as skeletal muscle a - actin from Mus musculus [ 11 ] , Oryctolagus cuniculus [ 12 ] , Gallus gallus [ 13 – 15 ] , Leishmania major [ 16 ] and actin I from P . falciparum [ 17 ] to resolutions between 2 . 15 - 3 Å . The short length and instability of P . falciparum actin I has allowed structure determination only of filaments stabilized by jasplakinolide ( JAS ) . Here , we explored the function of Plasmodium berghei actin II in the parasite . We provide a detailed analysis of expression of actin II in gametocytes and zygotes , revealing that the protein is mainly found associated with the nucleus in these stages . Furthermore , mutants of actin II reveal that the protein tolerates fewer changes for its function in the development of oocysts than for the function in gametogenesis . The critical role of the conserved residue H73 was revealed in mutant parasites . In addition , we present near - atomic - resolution cryo - EM structures of F - actin II in the ADP - Mg state with and without JAS and describe the polymerization properties of the so far uncharacterized actin II . Results Expression of actin II is restricted to the sexual stages In order to understand in more detail the spatial and temporal localization of actin II in the parasite , we generated transgenic P . berghei parasites expressing actin II N - terminally fused to FLAG ; the small FLAG peptide was not expected to interfere with the function of the protein . Two different transgenic lines were used in the subsequent experiments ( Supplemental material ) , one generated by the conventional approach , while the other was a marker - free mutant produced using CRISPR / Cas9 methodology [ 18 ] . Both mutants developed normally at all stages ( Supplemental material ) [ 18 ] . To determine the timing of expression of actin II , we carried out Western blot analysis of flag : : actII extracts of purified samples from mixed blood stages , activated gametocytes , and zygotes . The blot was probed with a commercial antibody recognizing FLAG to specifically highlight actin II ( Fig 1a ) . This revealed that actin II expression was highly upregulated after induction of gametogenesis . The protein was weakly expressed in .

These results are consistent with our genetic analysis , which showed that male gametogenesis was abolished in a mutant lacking actin II [ 8 ] , while on the other hand , maternal expression of actin II in the zygote stage is strictly required for development of the oocyst stages [ 19 ] . Extracts of dissected mosquito midguts containing oocysts ( harvested 3 and 10 d post - blood feeding ) were also analyzed by Western blot ; in this case , no signal was detected ( S2a Fig ) . These results are consistent with previous results on the transcription of the gene [ 19 ] . .

( e ) Montage of single slices of the z - stacks of the 2 h sample shown in ( d ) ( middle row ) . Immunolabeling using the anti - FLAG antibody to detect actin II was carried out in different stages of the parasite ( Fig 1b - e ) . Male gametocytes showed a dynamic actin II signal . In non - activated gametocytes , the protein was seen mainly in the nucleus ( Fig 1b and 1c ) , although a weaker signal was also detected in the cytoplasm ( white arrow in ( Fig . 1b ) , 0 min sample ) . Later ( 4 min post activation ) , its expression was restricted to the nucleus , as revealed by the overlap with DNA . 8 min after activation , the protein was localized in the periphery of the nucleus as long rods in some cells or as dots or very short rods in others . This pattern was seen in a minority of the cells observed ( ~ 10 % ) , suggesting that the protein is only briefly present in the rod - like structures . In exflagellating males , the protein was localized in the residual cell with no signal in the flagellar male gamete . In .

Localization of FLAG : : actinII was also investigated in zygotes ( Fig 1d and 1e ) . In zygotes , two patterns were seen . Most samples showed diffuse actin II in the nucleus . In rare samples , the protein was localized in rods associated with the nucleus . This may suggest that transient filaments are formed during zygote maturation . In ookinetes , no signal was detected ( S2c Fig ) , consistent with the Western blot analysis . These results are consistent with our previous studies of mutants lacking actin II , but also offer new insights into the function of the protein . The timing of expression coincides with the stages that are affected in the mutants . The cytoplasmic localization in non - activated gametocytes suggests a direct role of actin II in the release from the surrounding host cell . However , the association with the nucleus in activated gametocytes and zygotes was unexpected , and this finding offers novel insights into the function of actin II . Furthermore , the rod - like structures detected suggest that filaments are transiently formed . Near - atomic - resolution structures of filamentous actin II Actins are very conserved among eukaryotic organisms , owing to their essential functions in different cellular processes . Significant differences in terms of sequence conservation of actin II compared to actin I and α - actins involve the D - loop and subdomains ( SD ) 3 and 4 ( S3 Fig , S1 Movie ) . To understand the molecular basis of the filament - forming properties of actin II , required specifically in the sexual stages of the parasite life cycle , we set out to determine a high - resolution structure of the actin II filament in the absence and presence of JAS , which has previously facilitated structure determination of the highly unstable actin I filaments . The average resolution of the actin II filaments with and without JAS are similar , 3 . 3 and 3 . 5 Å , respectively , according to Fourier correlation , using the 0 . 143 criterium ( S1 Table and S4 Fig ) . The actin core is well resolved in both structures with resolutions similar to other filamentous actins [ 10 , 11 , 21 , 22 ] . However , the D - loop shows a lower local resolution in both reconstructions ( S5 Fig ) . The first four residues of the N terminus were not resolved . We modeled six subunits of the filament into the density in both cases . Density for ADP and Mg 2 + was clearly identified in both maps ( Fig 2 ) . .

Structure of filamentous actin II . Reconstructions of actin II ( a ) and JAS - stabilized actin II ( b ) filaments . Six actin protomers were built and are shown in the density map in different colors . Density for ADP - Mg 2 + is shown in yellow and for JAS in orange . Conformation of protomers in filamentous parasite actins The helical twist angle for filamentous actin II was - 166 . 9° and was not affected by JAS . Thus , the helical parameters of actin II are closer to α - actin ( - 166 . 6 ) than to actin I ( - 167 . 65 ) , as we have also observed before in low - resolution reconstructions [ 5 , 22 , 23 ] . The overall conformation of the filament and the SDs in the protomers resemble those of other actins . As the filament grows , the D - loop ( SD2 ) at the pointed end inserts into the C terminus ( SD3 ) at the barbed end of the next protomer . The nucleotide - binding pocket located between the inner and outer domains ( ID and OD ) is occupied by ADP and Mg 2 + . As in other actins , the transition from G - to F - form involves significant conformational changes [ 9 , 24 ] . The interdomain dihedral angle ( θ ) is larger in G - actins and the OD SDs undergoes a " flattening " type of movement upon insertion to the filament ( S2 Movie ) . F - .

However , there are slight differences in the θ angles of the different actins . The θ angle of F - actin II with JAS is rotated 0 . 3° relative to the F - actin II , 0 . 9° relative to G . gallus F - actin ( 6DJO ) , 2 . 5° and 3 . 5° relative to the F - actin I structures ( 5OGW , 6TU4 ) ( S3 Movie ) . In conclusion , F - actin I is more flattened than the other F - actins , including F - actin II ( S6 Fig ) . Likewise , the different conformations of certain side chains in F - actin II were observed compared to G - actin II . The S14 side chain is turned towards H73 , which is methylated ( S2 Table ) , and R270 to D184 in F - actin II ( S3 Movie ) . Moreover , the C terminus is ordered , except for F376 , in which the density of the phenyl group is weak . In both structures , H372 interacts with E117 ( 3 Å ) . However , the distance between H372 and K113 is longer in F - actin II structures ( 5 . 6 Å and 5 . 5 Å ) than F - actin I or G - actin II ( 4 . 3 Å and 5 Å ) ( S7 Fig ) . In contrast , the distance between H372 and K114 in actin I is ~ 3 Å because of the displacement of the N - terminal tip of the helix [ 27 ] . Protomer interactions within the filament In filamentous form , individual actin protomers interact with protomers from the same strand ( intrastrand interactions ) and the opposite strand ( interstrand interactions ) . SD2 and SD4 at the pointed end of one protomer interact with SD3 at the barbed end of the adjacent protomer of the same strand . The D - loop ( 39 - 50 ) , W - loop ( 165 - 172 ) , and some regions of SD3 ( 270 - 274 , 283 - 294 ) and SD4 ( 195 - 208 , 243 - 247 ) are involved in the intrastrand interactions ( S8 Fig ) . In skeletal muscle α - actin , the primary intrastrand contact is caused by a hydrophobic key ( I287 of SD3 ) and lock ( a groove of SD4 ) interaction . The residues S199 and V201 in α - actin are replaced by T199 and T201 in actin II and G200 and S202 in actin I . These changes decrease the hydrophobicity around the key - lock contact . The interaction is even weaker in F - actin I , caused by the replacement of I287 ( in α - actin ) by a V288 [ 22 ] ( S9 Fig ) . Another intrastrand interaction is mediated by the D - loop in SD2 ; the D - loop interacts with the adjacent protomer via hydrophobic interactions and is indispensable for polymerization [ 28 ] . In most crystal structures , the D - loop is disordered . The D - loop in Plasmodium actins differs from canonical actins by the substitution of four residues , R39 , G41 , V43 , and G48 ( in α - actins ) by K40 , P42 , I44 , and E49 ( in actin I ) or K39 , P41 , I43 , and E48 ( in actin II ) .

In skeletal muscle α - actins , Y169 forms an N - H···π bond with the side chain of Q49 [ 23 ] , contributing to filament stability . In Plasmodium actins , the side chain of either E50 ( F - actin I ) or Q49 ( F - actin II ) is in an opposite orientation . Interestingly , the substitution of H40 , V139 , and A170 ( canonical actins ) by M40 , I139 , and V170 in actin II increases the hydrophobicity in actin II . Only one substitution exists between actin I and actin II , G43 in actin I , by a polar amino acid N42 in actin II ( Fig 3 ) . Fig 3 . Interaction of the D - loop with the adjacent protomer .

This interaction is structurally conserved . However , in Plasmodium actins , the substitution of M269 in canonical actins by K270 ( actin I ) or R270 ( actin II ) inverts the electrostatic potential ( Fig 4 ) . Previous studies on T . gondii and P . falciparum actins showed that mutation of K270 to M increases the filament stability [ 27 , 29 ] . In actin II , R270 does not seem to cause shortening of the filaments . K270 in actin I increases the positive charge of the surface more than R270 in actin II ( Fig 4a - 5c ) . This could be a contributing factor to the actin II filaments being more stable than F - actin I . In addition to the electrostatic interaction of the plug , there are other residues involved in the interstrand contacts ; H173 ( SD3 ) and L113 ( SD1 ) of one protomer with L39 ( SD2 ) and the residues E195 and G269 ( SD4 ) of the opposite protomer ( S10 Fig ) . .

The surface colored by electrostatic Coulomb potential ranges from −10 kcal·mol −1 ( red ) to + 10 kcal·mol −1 ( blue ) , and the opposing subunits are displayed as ribbon . Long and stable actin filaments alone are not sufficient for oocyst development Previously , we analyzed a chimeric actin where the D - loop of actin I was replaced with that of α - actin . In vitro , this chimeric actin , expressed in a heterologous system , formed long and stable filaments . We also generated a mutant expressing the chimera from the actin II locus in the actII ( - ) background . This mutant showed normal exflagellation [ 5 ] . Here , we tested whether this mutant could form normal oocysts . Mosquitoes were fed on a mouse infected with this chimeric ( actIchi ) mutant , and midguts were dissected and labeled with an antibody against the oocyst capsule protein Cap380 . This revealed that oocysts were formed , although in significantly reduced numbers compared to the WT . They remained small , and no sporozoites developed , thus resulting in a block in mosquito transmission ( Fig 5 ) . Thus , for normal oocyst formation , also other specific features of actin II seem to be necessary , not simply the ability to form long and stable filaments . .

His73 is crucial for actin II function in oocyst development From our earlier high - resolution structures ( Vahokoski et a . 2014 ) , we saw that unlike H74 in actin I , around 90 % of actin II has a H73 methylation when expressed in insect cells ( S11a and S12 Fig ) . Using Matrix - assisted laser desorption ionisation - time of flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI - TOF MS ) , we confirmed that H73 is methylated in a significant fraction of actin II ( S11b Fig ) , as is the case also in most canonical actins . Methylation of this histidine stabilizes the filament [ 30 ] . In actin I , the so - called A - loop plays a role in defining filament length . In the proposed model , the A - loop undergoes a ping - pong movement between two positive charges , such that D180 - interacts either with K270 + or the unmethylated , protonated H74 + , promoting and stable and unstable filament .

In the case of F - actin II , the A - loop has a conformation similar to canonical actins and the G - actin II structure , where D179 is oriented towards R177 ( S13 Fig ) and does not interact with the methylated H73 . Thus , neither in the crystal structures of actin II [ 27 ] nor in the filament structures described here , the " unstable " conformation is detected . To abolish the regulation by methylation , we introduced a point mutation in the actin II gene , obtaining the actIIH73Q mutant ( S14 Fig ) . This mutant was able to normally form male gametes , as exflagellation took place and ookinete conversion was comparable to the WT ( Fig 6a and 6b ) . Thus , a histidine at position 73 and its possible methylation are not important for the function of actin II in these early mosquito stages . Next , mice infected with WT and the mutant were offered to A . gambiae female mosquitoes . After 12 - 13 days , midguts were dissected and labeled for the oocyst capsule protein Cap380 , and DNA was stained . All oocysts were counted , even those that were small , and this revealed only a minor decrease in the number of oocysts in the actIIH73Q strain comparing to the WT ( Fig 6c ) . However , the mutant oocysts were significantly smaller than the WT ( Fig 6d and Fig 6e ) . In addition , 80 % of WT oocysts contained DNA , while only 42 % of the mutant oocysts had visible DNA staining . In the mutant oocysts , no sporozoites were formed . To investigate this further , we allowed infected mosquitoes to feed on naïve mice . Giemsa - stained blood samples were observed from day five onwards . This revealed that , while in the WT strain infection was detectable at day five ( two mice ) , we never detected any parasites in the mice bitten by the mosquitoes infected with actIIH73Q ( five mice ) , even ten days after the mosquito feeding . Taken together , this shows that H73 and possibly its methylation in actin II are important for oocyst development , and that the mutant parasites were unable to form infectious sporozoites . This is similar to what we found for the a ctIchi mutant , although in that case , the oocyst phenotype was more severe . To confirm that H73 is indeed methylated in vivo , mass spectrometry was carried out on extracts from zygotes and this revealed a signal consistent with methylation ( Fig S11 ) . .

Actin I in polymerizing conditions is present mostly as monomers , dimers , and oligomers up to around 17 - 18 units [ 31 ] . To shed light on the situation for actin II , we performed sedimentation assays , applying high relative centrifugal forces of 100 000 and 435 000 g . At the highest speed , the amount of actin II in the pellet was comparable to actin I ( 73 % vs . 69 % , p = 0 . 38 , Student’s t - test ) . The amount of actin II - JAS in the pellet after centrifugation at 435000 g increased by approximately 9 % compared to actin II without JAS ( p = 0 . 001 , Student’s t - test ) ( Fig 7a and 7b ) . Similarly to actin I , the supernatant fraction of actin II could be re - pelleted ( 75 % ) 16 h after the initial centrifugation step ( S15 Fig ) . We employed dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) to study the size distribution of the actin II samples . In non - polymerizing conditions , actin II appeared to be in a mostly dimeric form with a hydrodynamic radius ( r H ) of 5 . 1 nm in comparison with the G - α - actin ( 2 . 7 nm ) previously reported [ 31 ] . Under polymerizing conditions , actin II was distributed into three populations with r H of 8 . 1 , 43 , and 410 nm , with volume percentage contributions of 51 , 33 , and 17 % . Conversely , actin I in polymerizing conditions was more heterogeneous , consisting of dimers with an r H of 5 . 4 nm ( 92 % ) and a heterogeneous population with an r H between 11 and 39 nm ( 8 . 33 % ) . JAS - stabilized actin II was distributed into four populations : 16 , 69 , 210 , and 680 nm , comprising 47 % , 16 % , 1 % , and 33 % of the total volume , respectively ( Fig 7c and 7d ) . Interestingly , we observed some long actin II filaments of ≥ 1 . 5 μm using negative - stain electron microscopy , similar to the maximum length of F - actin I reported previously [ 27 ] . The remaining protein was present as monomers , dimers , or trimers . In contrast to actin I , shorter filaments or filament - like structures between 0 . 3 - 1 . 5 μm were observed ( Fig 7e ) . .

In non - polymerizing conditions , the major population corresponds to a dimer . Overall , the F - actin II oligomers and polymers appear larger than those of actin I , which is mainly present as dimers and filament - like structures from 4 to 17 protomers . JAS increases the pelletable actin II , especially at the lower g forces , due to its stabilizing effect . Jasplakinolide does not affect the overall actin II filament conformation JAS stabilizes both actin I and II as well as canonical actin filaments . However , unlike for actin I , JAS is not required for obtaining stable long filaments of actin II . Furthermore , JAS has been postulated to induce changes in the filament conformation of a - actin [ 32 ] . Therefore , we wanted to confirm whether JAS affects the filament conformation for actin II . In α - actin , JAS promotes conformational changes in the D - loop ( open state ) and the C - terminus ( disorder ) [ 21 ] . The D - loop in our structures has a closed conformation ( P41 and E48 ) ( S16 Fig ) . Only the residue located in the filament interface is substituted by Y199 while Y53 remains the same as in α - actin . Furthermore , JAS reduces the P i release rate without modifying the polymerization rate [ 33 , 34 ] . In JAS - stabilized actin II , density for the leaving phosphate is not observed . Close to the D - loop , the residues R62 ( SD2 ) and D245 ( SD3 ) form two important salt bridges with D289 and R291 ( SD3 ) of the adjacent protomer . Notably , the distance between R62 and D289 in JAS - stabilized F - actin II is shorter than in F - actin II without JAS . A similar effect occurs in α - actins with the residues R290 and D244 . Interestingly , Zea mays F - actin was suggested to be more stable than α - actin filaments and JAS - stabilized actin I . Without JAS , Z . mays F - actin exhibits an open D - loop conformation , and the distances of the salt bridge interactions are shorter than in α - actin [ 35 ] ( Fig 7 f - k ) . These observations suggest that multiple intrastrand interactions work synergically to contribute to the stability of the actin filament . Furthermore , JAS does not affect the overall architecture of the actin II filaments or the conformations of the D - loop and the C terminus . It is plausible that this is the case for both Plasmodium actins . .

To assess whether the C c of actin I and II , determined using pyrene - actin fluorescence , is dependent on the polymerization time , Plasmodium actins were labeled with pyrene [ 31 ] and polymerized for 1 or 20 h at 4°C . Concentrations above 5 μM had not been tested before for actin I using this method [ 31 ] . The C c was calculated as the first concentration point , where a linear increase in fluorescence signal started . For both actin I and II , we got a C c identical to the one observed previously for actin ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 μM ) after polymerizing for 1 h ( Fig 8a - d ) . Interestingly , a second linear slope was observed after 20 h of polymerization for actin I and already 1 h after for actin II . This second intercepting point gave C c s of 1 . 9 μM for actin I and 4 . 6 or 3 . 0 μM for actin II after 1 and 20 h , respectively . A linear regression curve was also observed for actin II polymerized in the presence of JAS ( ratio 1 : 1 ) . The C c did not change significantly upon addition of JAS either after 1 or 20 h of polymerization ( S17 Fig ) . Thus , JAS seems to merely affect the stability and not the C c of the Plasmodium actin filaments . Based on these data , we conclude that both Plasmodium actins exhibit a C c similar to that of canonical actins . Besides , the C c plot at the steady - state is not linear , and the two slopes that we observed could be related to different populations of actin II filaments . We speculate that the first slope corresponds to the excess of nucleation at concentrations below 3 μM , and the second slope could be the elongation phase of longer filaments . .

Polymerization and depolymerization kinetics of actin II We wanted to compare the polymerization kinetics of the two Plasmodium actins . To keep them monomeric , the proteins were purified in 0 . 3 M ammonium acetate , which was removed immediately before performing the polymerization assays . Although a lag phase was observed for both actins , it was less pronounced for actin II . Actin II also reached equilibrium faster than actin I . After 100 min , concentrations below 5 μM were in equilibrium for actin II , while for actin I , the equilibrium was reached in approximately 120 min at 5 μM ( Fig 8e and 8f ) . This may reflect the instability of actin I filaments . The actin II polymerization curves exhibited an overshoot , which presents itself as a peak in the first 10 min of polymerization both in the presence and absence of seeds . The overshoot was less pronounced at lower actin concentrations and in the presence of actin II nuclei ( Fig 8f and 8g ) . This overshoot has also been reported for canonical actins and is related to fast ATP hydrolysis that causes partial depolymerization of the actin - ADP subunits at the pointed end of the filament . This phenomenon can increase by branching , severing by sonication , and the presence of ADF / cofilin or seed filaments [ 37 – 39 ] . For determining the elongation rate constant , actin II was polymerized in the presence of 0 . 5 μM pre - polymerized actin II seeds [ 31 ] . The first 20 min of polymerization exhibited two different phases , as was previously observed for actin I using skeletal muscle α - actin seeds [ 31 ] . The first phase was 4 - fold faster than the second . Using the C c value obtained .

In conclusion , actin II polymerization curves exhibited three phases : lag , elongation , and treadmilling phases like other actins . The observed k + and k - were lower compared to α - actin and actin I [ 31 ] . This could be related to the overshoot which was observed in the first 5 - 10 min of polymerization . Discussion Actin II expression and localization The presence of actin II only in male gametocytes and female gametes and zygotes confirms our earlier analyses of mutants lacking actin II [ 8 , 19 ] . Here , we show for the first time that actin II is associated with the nucleus both in the male gametocyte and in the zygote . Immunolabelling of samples obtained during the short time of gametocyte development ( ~ 10 - 15 min ) revealed a dynamic pattern . In non - activated samples , actin II was mainly in the nucleus , but a cytoplasmic signal in the cell was also visible . This may indicate that it is directly involved in the rupture of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and the host cell membrane , consistent with the earlier finding that , in the actin II deletion mutant , rupture of the membranes was blocked [ 8 ] . In developing male gametocytes , mainly a diffuse signal was detected in the nucleus , but in rare occasions of cells fixed at 8 min p . a . , actin II was seen as distinct dots or rods associated with the nucleus . This pattern resembles the localization of tubulin [ 40 , 41 ] , but attempts to verify co - localization were inconclusive . In the actin II deletion mutant , DNA replication took place but karyokinesis did not . Furthermore , axonemes that were normally formed were not activated . Thus , actin II may be associated with the axonemes that are formed in close association with the nucleus [ 42 ] . In zygotes , the protein also associated with the nucleus in two distinct patterns . In most samples , there was a diffuse signal , while in rare cases , rod - like structures were seen . We have previously shown , using a mutant encoding GFP - actin II , that overexpression of actin II blocked parasite development once meiosis was completed . Furthermore , ookinetes derived from a .

Taken together , these data argue against a direct role for actin II in meiosis . Actins in higher eukaryotes have important functions in the nucleus , being involved in transcriptional regulation , chromatin organization , mitosis , and meiosis as well as nuclear structure [ 43 ] . We can exclude a specific role in transcriptional regulation based on a transcriptomics analysis of gametocytes of the actin II deletion mutant [ 44 ] , but a more exact understanding of the role of actin II must await further studies . Differences between Plasmodium actins affect the length of the filaments The most obvious difference between Plasmodium actins and canonical actins is the short length of the filaments observed in vitro [ 5 , 27 , 45 ] . The first explanation suggested for this was an isodesmic mechanism of T . gondii actin assembly [ 46 ] , which has subsequently been shown to not be the case for Plasmodium actin I [ 31 , 36 ] . Another explanation for the filament length differences is a model based on fragmentation , proposed for actin I . In this model , filament stability is determined by the interactions of D180 in the A - loop with either K270 ( plug ) or H74 in the H - loop ( depending on its protonation state ) . This promotes a ping - pong movement of the A - loop , causing a change of the θ angle , which acts as a switch between stable and unstable filament conformations [ 27 ] . While spontaneous fragmentation appears to be more favorable for actin I , it does not seem to be the case for actin II . However , the length of the filaments in actin II seems to be shorter , and the occurrence of long filaments lower than in canonical actins [ 5 ] . Fragmentation in canonical actins is dependent on filament length [ 47 ] . Possibly , it is the case also for actin II since there is no evidence of a ping - pong movement of the A - loop . In comparison with actin I , the fragmentation of actin II could be less favorable due to structural differences that do not permit the second conformation of the A - loop . In actin II , fragmentation could be mediated in vivo by other mechanisms , such as ABPs or the intracellular environment . Actin II has a cysteine in position 272 , like non - muscle β and γ - actins . This cysteine is the most reactive residue towards H 2 O 2 in solution , and its oxidation causes negative effects on ABP interactions and depolymerization [ 48 ] . In actin I , this residue 272 is an alanine , and the mutation A272C favored the stable A - loop .

Perhaps , reactive oxygen species could have different effects on the depolymerization and / or fragmentation of the two Plasmodium actins in vivo . While lateral contacts between actin monomers are important for filament stability , the longitudinal contacts are also essential . The D - loop plays a major role in longitudinal interactions . The largest differences in the Plasmodium actin D - loop compared to α - actin are in the tip of the loop . Both Plasmodium actins have a substitution of Q42 and G49 ( in α - actins ) by P41 / 42 and E48 / 49 ( actin II / I ) . In actin I , these residues impact P i release and are possibly related to the closed conformation of the D - loop . The mutation P42Q that increases the filament stability in vitro is lethal in vivo [ 49 ] . Also , in filamentous α - actins , Y169 forms an N - H···π bond with the Q49 side chain [ 23 ] . However , E50 ( in F - actin I ) or Q49 ( in F - actin II ) adopt an opposite orientation . Despite the similarity of the D - loop in actin I and II , the P41 and E48 substitutions do not drastically seem to affect the filament length in actin II . Thus , other factors must also play important roles . Especially residues M40 , I139 , and V170 in actin II may contribute to strengthening the hydrophobic interactions between SD3 of one monomer and the D - loop of the adjacent monomer ( Fig 4 ) . Different requirements for actin II during male gametogenesis and zygote - to - ookinete development Complementation of actin II deletion mutant parasites with a chimeric actin I with the canonical actin D - loop partially restored the phenotype , as exflagellation of the male gametocytes took place normally [ 5 ] . In this mutant , oocysts formed , albeit in lower numbers , but they did not develop and remained very small . This phenotype is similar to what we have found for parasites , in which actin I was expressed from the actin II locus in the actII ( - ) mutant background [ 19 ] . In that case , exflagellation was however also severely reduced , but the few ookinetes that developed did form oocysts , which remained small . As the chimeric actin I forms long and stable filaments in vitro , these results suggest that while the function in exflagellation can tolerate more radical changes in structure , oocyst formation is very sensitive to perturbations . Further indication for different requirements for actin II in the two stages was obtained from the H73Q mutant parasites . Methylation of H73 is involved in actin monomer stability .

In heterologously expressed actin I , the corresponding H74 is not methylated [ 27 ] . In actin II , the methylation of H73 seems to stabilize the interaction with D179 , favoring the stable A - loop conformation ( Fig S9 ) . In the actIIH73Q mutant , male gametogenesis was not affected , but oocyst development was abnormal , and sporozoites never developed . We have described a similar phenotype in mutant parasites where actin II was expressed from a transgene [ 51 ] ; while exflagellation was normal , oocyst development was aberrant . Taken together , these experiments indicate that the function of actin II in the zygote has strict requirements both for timing of expression and filament stability / length and that regulation by methylation of H73 may be important for the function of actin II in this life cycle stage . Effect of JAS on filamentous actin II JAS stabilizes Plasmodium actin filaments without disturbing the architecture of the polymer . The binding site of JAS is the same as for phalloidin ; between three protomers . Studies on canonical actins suggested that the D - loop state could contribute to filament stability . An open D - loop state is reported for rabbit skeletal muscle α - actin in the presence of a modified JAS ( JAS - cLys ) , phalloidin in ADP - Mg 2 + state , and α - actin - ADP – BeFx state [ 21 , 32 ] . Recently , an open D - loop conformation was also observed in F - actin - ADP - Mg 2 + from Z . mays . Z . mays F - actin is more stable and rigid than α - actins and JAS - stabilized actin I [ 35 ] . On the other hand , other cryo - EM structures of α - actin bound to JAS or with ADP - Mg 2 + , AMPPNP or ADP - P i did not show changes in the D - loop state [ 13 , 23 ] . For Plasmodium actin II , JAS stabilizes the filaments without affecting the D - loop conformation . JAS strengthens the interaction of R62 ( SD2 ) and D289 ( SD3 ) between two adjacent protomers . This is likely the case for actin I as well , although , so far , there are no filament structures available in the absence of JAS . JAS inhibits P i release without modifying the polymerization rate [ 33 , 34 ] . Consequently , it was observed that the phosphate is present in cryo - EM structures of α - actins polymerized in the presence of JAS [ 13 , 21 , 23 ] . In contrast , density for the phosphate is not observed in JAS - stabilized F - actins II in this study or actin I [ 22 ] . Yet , the conformation of S14 and the backdoor appear as in canonical actins when the phosphate is not yet released . Thus , further studies on the mechanism of phosphate release from Plasmodium actins are required to understand its role in filament dynamics . .

This would differ from the classic nucleation - elongation process described for canonical actins , being a non - cooperative process that is not dependent on nucleation . This would exhibit itself as a lack of an apparent C c for polymerization and the absence of a lag phase in the polymerization curve . However , more recently , a C c has been reported for actin I in two different studies by us and others , albeit the apparent C c in these differ substantially from each other [ 31 , 36 ] . The differences are likely due to the different methods used for determining the C c and , thus , the different length of polymers / oligomers considered as filaments . Secondly , the polymerization curves of Plasmodium actins exhibit a lag phase , albeit less pronounced than in a - actin , that disappears in the presence of α - actin seeds . Our earlier data on actin I and the data reported here on actin II together could support a nucleation - elongation , rather than isodesmic , mechanism for both Plasmodium actins . However , not all features of the parasite actin polymerization seem to fit that model either . Alternatively , an anticooperative mechanism , where dimers are energetically more favored than elongation of the polymer [ 52 , 53 ] , could explain the excessive nucleation , the lower population of large filaments , and the highly unusual abundance of dimers in Plasmodium actins . This is something to consider for future investigations . Concluding remarks The minor isoform , actin II , is only required at two very specific time points in the complex life cycle of the malaria parasite : during male gametogenesis and zygote formation . Our data here reveal that in both these stages actin II forms transient filament - like structures associated with the nucleus . This finding is complemented with biochemical and structural studies that reveal that actin II in vitro behaves to a large extent similarly to canonical actins and forms long and stable filaments , in contrast to the ubiquitously expressed actin I . The requirement for critically defined specific polymerization characteristics can provide an explanation why in Plasmodium a second actin isoform evolved , in contrast to other apicomplexan parasites that only possess one actin . .

The deletion mutant act2 − : : mCherry in which the actin II ORF was deleted , has been described described [ 54 ] as well as the marker - free strain expressing FLAG : : actin II under the actin II promoter [ 18 ] . Parasites were maintained in 6 - 10 week old OlaTo mice through serial passages with intraperitoneal injection of infected blood . Two days before injection with infected blood , the animals were treated with 100 μl of phenylhydrazine ( 25 mg / ml stock solution ) . Parasitaemia and gametocytemia were determined by counting of Giemsa - stained blood smears . Gametocytes were obtained from blood of an infected animal . For non - activated samples the blood was immediately added to fixative . Gametocytes were activated after diluting infected blood 1 : 10 in activation medium ( RPMI1640 with L - glutamine , 25 mM HEPES , 2 g / L NaHCO3 , 10 % foetal bovine serum , 50 μM xanthurenic acid , pH 8 . 0 ) and incubating the samples at 19°C . Exflagellation events were counted under the microscope after activation for 10 - 15 min . Cultures of ookinetes was carried out using the method described [ 55 ] . Activated females were isolated from ookinete cultures 15 min after seeding using magnetic beads coated with the 13 . 1 antibody . Zygotes were obtained using the same method at different time points after seeding of the culture . Ookinete conversion was assessed as previously described [ 8 ] . Briefly , ookinetes , female gametes and zygotes were labeled with the 13 . 1 anti - Pbs21 antibody and at least 100 cells were counted in each experiment . Mosquitoes used were Anopheles gambiae strain G3 [ 55 ] . Mosquitoes were fed on anaesthetized infected mice . Infected mosquitoes were kept at 19°C until dissection for oocyst counts or feeding to naïve C57BL / 6 mice . Western blot .

The signal was detected using the SuperSignal West Pico solution ( Pierce Biotechnology ) . Immunofluorescence assay . Gametocytes were obtained from infected blood samples diluted 1 : 5 in activation medium ( RPMI1640 with L - glutamine , 25 mM HEPES , 2 g / L NaHCO3 , 10 % foetal bovine serum , 50 μM xanthurenic acid , pH 8 . 0 ) supplemented with 50 μM xanthurenic acid ; samples were incubated for the indicated time at 19°C . 5 volumes of fixative was then added containing 4 % formaldehyde in microtubule stabilizing buffer ( MTSB , 10 mM MES , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , 5 mM Mg 2 Cl , pH 6 . 9 ) . The cells were spun down on 13 mm round cover slips coated with poly - L lysine at 400 g for 10 min at room temperature ( RT ) , permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 diluted in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) for 2 min , and washed once in PBS for 5 min .

The antibodies recognizing Pbs21 ( 13 . 1 monoclonal antibody ) [ 56 ] , P . berghei actin I [ 20 ] and Cap380 [ 57 ] have been described . The secondary antibody used in the immunofluorescence experiments was Alexa - 647 anti - rabbit obtained from Thermo Fisher Invitrogen , while in the western blot a secondary HRP conjugated antibody was used ( directed against rabbit IgG ) , obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch . Generation of flag : : actin II The initial flag : : actin II construct was generated using the same strategy as previously described for the Act2com and act2rep constructs [ 19 ] . Briefly , a PCR fragment was generated with a 5’ - primer encoding FLAG fused to the coding sequence for the N terminus of actin II ; the ATG initiation codon was introduced before the flag sequence . The reverse primer corresponded to the C - terminus of the protein . The primers are listed in Supplemental Table S1 . Genomic DNA from WT parasites was used as the template for amplification . The fragment was introduced in the vector pSD141 , a derivative of the pL0006 vector [ 40 , 58 ] , already containing 2 . 7 kb of the actin II 5’FR and 728 bp of the 3’ - FR , using the restriction sites NheI and NotI . The plasmid was linearized with ClaI before transfection of the act2 - : : mCherry parasite strain , which had been recycled to remove the resistance cassette [ 54 ] . Parasites were cloned by limiting dilution [ 59 ] . Correct integration was verified by PCR genotyping . Actin purification The gene encoding P . falciparum actin II ( PlasmoDB PF3D7 _ 1412500 ) was synthesized and codon - optimized for insect cell expression in pFastBac HT A vector by Thermo Scientific . P . falciparum actin II was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf 9 cells ( Invitrogen ) at 27°C , as described before [ 60 ] . For purification , a fresh pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer ( 10 mM CHES pH 8 . 7 , 250 mM NaCl , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM imidazole , 1 mM ATP , 3 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 300 mM ammonium acetate ) with 1X SIGMAFAST protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma ) .

After cleavage , the protein was loaded through a Ni - NTA column before a size - exclusion chromatography using Superdex 200 increase 10 / 300 GL column ( GE Healthcare ) in G - buffer . Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated . The ammonium acetate was removed using a PD SpinTrap G - 25 column ( GE Healthcare ) ; the sample was eluted in G - buffer without ammonium acetate . Cryo - EM sample preparation , data collection , and image processing Actin II filaments were polymerized with 1xF buffer and 0 . 01 % sodium azide , both with and without JAS , which was used in a molar ratio of 1 : 2 ( actin : JAS ) . Actin II filaments in the presence of JAS were diluted to 10 μM and those without JAS to 5 μM . CryoEM grids of these samples were prepared by the application of 3 μl to airglow discharged 200mesh copper Quantifoil R2 / 2 grids , which were then plunge frozen into liquid ethane using an Mk111 Vitrobot ( Thermofisher ) operated at 90 % humidity at 4°C . For actin II with JAS , 4133 movies were collected using a Titan Krios electron microscope equipped with a Falcon 3 camera , operated at 300 kV . The magnification was 75000x , corresponding to 1 . 09 Å pixel - 1 . The movie stacks ( 46 frames ) were aligned with MotionCor2 [ 61 ] , and contrast transfer function parameters were estimated using CTFFind 4 . 1 . 10 [ 62 ] . The resulting 3977 aligned good micrographs were used for data processing . Filaments were picked with Relion AUTOPICK using a minimum inter - box distance of 30 . 5 Å , resulting in ~ 448000 particles , which were further classified with 3 rounds of reference - free 2D classification with 3x and , in the last round , with 2x binned .

Model building and refinement We build an atomic model of actin II based on a cryo - EM structure of actin I ( 5OGW ) [ 22 ] . The actin I model was mutated using the actin II sequence and placed in the density map using Coot 0 . 9 - pre [ 67 ] and Chimera 1 . 14 [ 68 ] . Namdinator was used to fit the initial atomic model to the density map and correct the model geometry [ 69 ] . The refinement was carried out for several rounds in reciprocal space with Phenix 1 . 19 . 2 [ 70 ] . Structure analysis The figures and videos of the structures were generated in Chimera 1 . 14 [ 68 ] and ChimeraX 1 . 2 . 5 .

Three samples were pooled in each experiment . The samples were lysed in 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 8 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM ATP [ 72 ] to which cocktails of protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added ( PMSF , protease inhibitor cocktail from Sigma ( cat no P2714 ) and phosphatase inhibitors A and B ( from SIGMA ) ) with sonication 4 times 15 sec on ice . TritonX - 100 was added to a final concentration of 1 % and the samples were incubated for 30 min , followed by centrifugation at 8000 g for 15 min . The supernatant ( 30 µ l ) was loaded on a NuPAGE Bis - Tris 4 - 12 % polyacrylamide gel ( Invitrogen , Massachusetts , United States ) , and run in MOPS buffer at 200 V .

Critical concentration determination Different concentrations of Plasmodium actins were polymerized , as was explained before . The fluorescence was then measured from triplicate samples after 1 and 20 h at 4°C . The plate reader and the optical settings were the same as in the polymerization assays . The results were fitted using a segmental linear equation and 1 / Y2 weighting in GraphPad Prism 9 : 1 . Y1 = intercept1 + slope1 * X 2 . YatX1 = slope1 * X1 + intercept1 3 . Y2 = YatX1 + slope2 * ( X – X1 ) 4 . Y = IF ( X < X1 , Y1 , Y2 ) The first line of the equation corresponds to the first line segment . The second line of the equation calculates the Y value of the first regression when X = X1 . The third line estimates the second regression segment . The final line defines Y for all values of X . Polymerization assays The actin polymerization assay was performed as described before [ 31 ] . The reaction mixture contained 50 μl label and unlabeled actin with pyrene ( in a ratio of 1 : 3 ) in GF - buffer with final concentrations between 0 to 7 μM , respectively . The reaction was started by adding 100 μl of 1x F - buffer ( 4 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl and 10 mM EGTA pH 8 ) . The final volume of the reaction was 150 μl . For nucleated polymerization assays , actin II seeds were added to the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 0 . 5 μM . The fluorescence of nucleated and non - nucleated polymerization assays was monitored for 2 h for actin I and actin II at 20°C .
