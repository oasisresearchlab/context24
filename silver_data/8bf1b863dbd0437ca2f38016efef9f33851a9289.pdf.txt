Narrative Report My long - term goal is to improve the lives of children , adolescents , and adults by eluci - dating various brain , mind , and psychiatric states , focusing mostly on drug abuse and drug dependency . In the service of this mission I apply bioengineering principles to psychiatry in order to develop more objective diagnoses and more e(cid:11)ective treatment regimens . Odor - induced craving Odors often provide evocative stimuli , and craving is likely no exception . I have developed a computer - controlled odor delivery system for use inside an MRI scanner , that has no metal parts in the scan room . Such precise control of odor delivery times makes maps of odor - induced craving in drug - dependent subjects possible . Wavelet analysis of functional MRI : In functional data , when analyzed with wavelet 2 transforms , I have observed shifts in slower temporal scales as well as in laterality dur - ing di(cid:11)erent emotional states . Encouragingly , pilot data show an especially strong change induced by oral administration of methylphenidate . Furthermore , reanalysis of cocaine - infusion fMRI data shows a robust change in wavelet transform parameters due to cocaine in this double - blind placebo - controlled study . These types of studies are helping to elucidate functional changes in the brains of substance - dependent subjects , as well as physiological changes induced by craving . It is hoped that this will lead to more accurate prediction of which cues cause craving , and therefore those which may lead to relapse . Fractal - based point processes : Fractals are objects that possess a form of self - scaling ; a part of the whole can be made to recreate the whole by shifting and stretching . Point processes are mathematical representations of random phenomena whose individual events are largely identical and occur principally at discrete times and locations . Fractal - based point processes model phenomena that have properties of both ; examples include the release of neurotransmitter molecules at a biological synapse , action potentials recorded from a neuron , and the sequence of human heartbeats . I have completed a comprehensive monograph ( see Book , below ) on this topic , to serve as a reference and textbook for this important (cid:12)eld . Dynamics of sleep - wake cycles : The consolidation of sleep - wake cycles is an important aspect of development . I analyzed these patterns in developing rats and showed how essen - tially memoryless transitions in young animals change into sleep - wake cycles displaying a fractal type of memory in adults . Objective motion detection : Subject motion has been widely recognized as a source of artifact in functional MRI data , particularly for drug abuse subjects . Methods for correcting for this motion exist ; however , their relative merits remain unknown , largely due to the lack of accurate real - world motion standards . I measured movement of human subjects in real time during MRI data acquisition using state - of - the - art infrared motion analysis , and showed that motion detection / correction algorithms disagree with each other and with absolute motion measurements . This has potential implications for all results based on functional MRI data . T2 maps : Maps of T2 provide complementary information to that obtained by T1 maps in conventional ( anatomical ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scans . I performed a precise analysis of noise in T2 - maps , developed a new stepping sequence which decreased this noise by a factor of two , and generated a new method for displaying T2 data which includes con(cid:12)dence information . Creatine and phosphocreatine Conventional proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy can - not distinguish between creatine and phosphocreatine , since they have identical chemical shifts . I developed a non - parametric analysis method of the time decay of these chemical species which robustly estimates their two separate quantities . Applying this method to cocaine abusers showed strong changes in the relative concentrations of creatine and phos - phocreatine , consistent with bioenergetic changes in brain chemistry induced by chronic drug use . McLean Motion and Attention Test ( MMAT ) : This test provides objective measures of attention , impulsivity , and activity for assisting in attention - de(cid:12)cit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) diagnosis . I have developed speci(cid:12)c algorithmic methods for tracking attentional state through time , which complement the composite state based on the entire test . I also explored the e(cid:11)ects of history on MMAT performance , showing that the e(cid:11)ects of previous test stimuli extend to six previous stimuli . Finally , I determined how normative data changes 3 with subject age and sex , and developed functional forms describing these changes . B .
