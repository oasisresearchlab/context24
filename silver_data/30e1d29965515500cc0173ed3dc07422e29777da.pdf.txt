In particular the role of the sarco - endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + - ATPase ( SERCA ) , in contributing to the components of agonist - induced signals is unclear . The aim of this work was to increase understanding of the detailed mechanism of Ca 2 + signalling in endothelial cells using real time confocal imaging of Fluo - 4 loaded intact rat tail arteries in response to muscarinic stimulation . In particular we have focused on the role of SERCA , and its interplay with capacitative Ca 2 + entry ( CCE ) and ER Ca 2 + release and uptake . We have determined its contribution to the Ca 2 + signalandhowitvarieswithdifferentphysiologicalstimuli , includingsingleandrepeatedcarbachol applications and brief and prolonged exposures . In agreement with previous work , carbachol stimulated a rise in intracellular Ca 2 + in the endothelial cells , consisting of a rapid initial phase , then a plateau upon which oscillations of Ca 2 + were superim - posed , followed by a decline to basal Ca 2 + levels upon carbachol removal . Our data support the following conclusions : ( i ) the size ( amplitude and duration ) of the Ca 2 + spike and early oscillations are limited by SERCA activity , thus both are increased if SERCA is inhibited . ( ii ) SERCA activity is such that brief appli - cations of carbachol do not trigger CCE , presumably because the fall in luminal Ca 2 + is not sufﬁcient to triggerit . However , longerapplicationssufﬁcienttodepletetheERorevenpartialSERCAinhibitionstim - ulate CCE . ( iii ) Ca 2 + entry occurs via STIM - mediated CCE and SERCA contributes to the cessation of CCE . In conclusion our data show how SERCA function is crucial to shaping endothelial cell Ca signals and its dynamic interplay with both CCE and ER Ca releases . © 2010 Elsevier Ltd .

Introduction Endothelial cells play a variety of important physiological roles , including inﬂuencing vascular tone , permeability , inﬂammation and platelet aggregation [ 1 – 5 ] . There is structural and functional heterogeneity in the endothelium depending on the size and loca - tion of the blood vessel it lines . However elevation of intracellular Ca 2 + in endothelial cells is key to their physiological functions , includingregulationofvasculartone , inter - endothelialcellgapfor - mation , angiogenesis , immune defense , gene expression and cell growth [ 6 , 7 ] . In endothelial cells Ca 2 + can be released from the intracellular store in the ER . Depletion of the ER Ca 2 + store induces Ca 2 + entry across the plasma membrane , in a process known as capacitative or store operated Ca 2 + entry ( CCE or SOCE ) [ 8 – 11 ] . Coupling of agonists to receptors can open receptor operated chan - nels , through which Ca 2 + can also enter the cell [ 12 – 15 ] .

Forexamplecytoso - lic calcium signalling plays an important role in the generation of endothelium derived relaxing factors ( NO , EDHF ) , which con - tributes to vascular smooth muscle relaxation , and in turn , reduces blood pressure . However , the mechanisms controlling the spatial and temporal characteristics of the Ca 2 + signalling involved in the activation of eNOS and other processes , are still poorly understood . Recently , the proteins STIM - 1 and Orai 1 have emerged as candi - date components mediating CCE [ 16 – 20 ] . Stim - 1 responds to the depletion of Ca 2 + stores activating CCE via interaction with ORAI . However , it has also been reported that unlike macrovessels , CCE is not important in microvascular endothelial cell [ 21 , 22 ] . We have recently shown that in ureteric precapillary arterioles ( microves - sels ) , Ca 2 + signalling in endothelial cells does not require Ca 2 + entry andconsistsmainlyofasynchronous , localized , highfrequencyCa 2 + oscillations [ 23 ] . From the above it can be appreciated that the SR / ER Ca - ATPase ( SERCA ) will be intimately involved in governing the characteris - tics and kinetics of agonist - induced Ca signals , through binding Ca , inﬂuencing Ca releases through IP 3 - dependent Ca 2 + channels and instigatingandterminatingCCEviaeffectsonluminalCalevels [ 24 ] . 0143 - 4160 / $ – see front matter © 2010 Elsevier Ltd .

Mumtaz et al . / Cell Calcium 49 ( 2011 ) 66 – 77 67 However the information concerning SERCA’s role in the endothe - lium is limited . Fierro and Parekh found that SERCA pumps were remarkably effective in RBL - 1 cells and could prevent I CRAC from activating , despite signiﬁcant Ca 2 + leakage from the stores [ 25 ] . Patch clamp studies in other types of cells [ 26 , 27 ] suggest how - ever that SERCA should be able to terminate CCE as it reﬁlls the store . Thus there is a need to systematically examine all these com - ponents in one cell type and endothelium from a single type of blood vessel . Furthermore there is also a lack of clarity around the roles of SERCA and CCE in the Ca 2 + signals occurring in intact endothelium . While there may be advantages to studying cultured endothelialcells , recentresearchhashighlightedtheimportanceof studying the intact endothelium e . g . [ 28 , 29 ] . In the current study therefore we have determined the temporal and spatial organi - zation of Ca 2 + signals induced by muscarinic stimulation in situ in Fluo - 4 loaded endothelial cells of rat tail artery using confo - cal microscopy , to better deﬁne the mechanisms controlling the characteristics of the Ca signals in response to muscarinic stimu - lation and the exact role of SERCA during different parameters of stimulations . We demonstrate that the initial Ca 2 + wave and the early Ca 2 + oscillations originated from the ER by the interplay of repetitive releases and re - uptake of Ca 2 + by IP 3 - dependent Ca 2 + channels and SERCA pump activity , respectively . In contrast , interplay between Ca 2 + release , Ca 2 + inﬂux through CCE channels and SERCA was required to sustain the late Ca 2 + oscillations and plateau . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Ca 2 + measurements Tail was removed from rat humanely killed by cervical dis - location under CO 2 anesthesia in accordance with Home Ofﬁce legislation Artery was dissected from the ventral grove , cleaned of fat and kept in physiological saline before use . They were loaded with Fluo - 4 acetoxymethyl ester ( Invitrogen , UK , 15 (cid:2) mol / L ; dis - solved in DMSO with pluronic acid ) for 2 – 3h at 20 ◦ C and then transferred to indicator - free solution for 30min . Small segments of Fluo - 4 loaded tail artery ( 3 – 4mm in length ) were cut open and ﬁxed to the bottom of the chamber by aluminum foil clips , to min - imize movement , with endothelium facing down . All experiments were performed at 30 ◦ C . We used a Nipkow disc based , confocal microscope ( Perkin Elmer ) , connected to a sensitive iXon cooled charge - coupled device camera ( Andor ) . Images were collected at 30 frames per second using a 60 × water objective ( NA 1 . 20 ) for best spatial resolution or dry ( 20 × , 0 . 70 NA ) for a larger ﬁeld of view . 2 . 2 . Solutions Physiological saline of the following composition was used ( mmol / L ) : NaCl 120 . 4 , KCl 5 . 9 , MgSO 4 1 . 2 , CaCl 2 2 . 0 , glu - cose 8 , and HEPES 11 . In some experiments , Ca 2 + - free solution ( 2mmol / L EGTA ) was used . 2 - Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate ( 2 - APB ) , ryanodine , and U - 73122 ( to inhibit phospholipase C ) , were from Calbiochem ( Nottingham , UK ) , all other chemi - cals were from Sigma ( UK ) . Phenylephrine , endothelin - 1 ( ET - 1 ) , ryanodine , and carbachol were dissolved in water ; 2 - APB , cyclopiazonic acid ( CPA , to inhibit SERCA ) , U - 73122 in DMSO . 2 . 3 . Immunohistochemistry Specimens of dissected tail artery in the absence of stimulation ( control ) or following two consecutive applications of carbachol in the presence of CPA to deplete Ca 2 + stores and maximally activate CCE ( see Fig . 11 for details ) , were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformalde - hyde in 0 . 1M phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , pH 7 . 4 for 1 . 5h at 23 ◦ C , and then in 25 % sucrose in 0 . 1M PBS overnight at 4 ◦ C , cut on a cryostat at 10 (cid:2) m and mounted onto poly - lysine coated microscope slides . Cryostat sections were rinsed in 0 . 1M PBS , permeabilized in alcohol and processed for single labelling immunoﬂuorescence . In brief , tissue sections were pre - blocked in 10 % normal donkey serum in 0 . 1M PBS and incubated with rabbit polyclonal STIM1 ( C - terminal ) antibody ( ProSci Incorpo - rated , Nottingham , UK ; 1 : 300 ) overnight at 4 ◦ C . The secondary antibody was Texas red - conjugated ( AfﬁniPure ) donkey anti - rabbit IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ; West Grove , PA , USA ) and sections of tail artery were mounted under Vec - tashield containing 4 (cid:4) 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( Vector Laboratories ) to preserve ﬂuorescence and stain cell nuclei . Speci - ﬁcity of immunostaining was determined by omitting the primary antibody . Sections were examined using an Axioplan Universal microscope , and images were processed using the Axio Vision 3 . 0 Imagingsystemwithdeconvolutionoptions ( CarlZeissVision , Jena , Germany ) . 2 . 4 . Statistics All analysis was performed using Microcal Origin 8 . 0 ( Mas - sachusetts , USA ) . Quantiﬁcation of calcium records from confocal imaging were made by measuring the peak amplitude , frequency and duration of calcium transients . The results are given as per - centage of control value unless otherwise stated . Values are means ± SEM , and n is number of vessels or cells . Between 3 and 5 animals were used for each series of experiments . Differences were taken as signiﬁcant at P < 0 . 05 in Student’s t - test . 3 . Results 3 . 1 .

( For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure legend , the reader is referred to the web version of the article . ) 3 . 2 . Temporal and spatial characteristics of the Ca 2 + transients induced by carbachol Initially we used three concentrations of CCh ( 0 . 1 , 1 and 10 (cid:2) M ) to assess the sensitivity of the intact endothelium . We observed variation between endothelial cells , ranging from transient local - ized Ca 2 + events ( puffs ) seen mainly with low concentration of [ CCh ] to complex global Ca 2 + transients , with an initial spike , then a plateau component , which usually had Ca 2 + oscillations superim - posedonit ( Fig . 2 , Video2 ) . Thepercentageofcellsrespondingwith global Ca 2 + transient to CCh was concentration dependent . Thus about 40 – 60 % of cells responded to 0 . 1 (cid:2) M , 90 – 92 % to 1 (cid:2) M and 99 – 100 % to 10 (cid:2) M CCh . The initial spike component was a regen - erative propagating ( 14 – 44 (cid:2) m / s ) Ca 2 + wave , initiated at one or both ends of the cells ( Fig . 2A and C , Video 2 ) . As shown in Fig . 2C , where traces from the images in Fig . 2A have been superimposed , to show how the initial wave from either region 1 or 3 , propa - gates to region 2 in the centre of the cell . The frequency of Ca 2 + oscillations was also variable and concentration dependent ( Fig . 2B and D ) . Ca 2 + oscillations at 0 . 1 (cid:2) M CCh ranged between 0 . 02 and 0 . 08Hz ( n = 51 cells , 5 vessels ) , at 1 (cid:2) M they were 0 . 08 – 0 . 33Hz ( n = 63 cells , 7 vessels ) , and at10 (cid:2) M CCh they were 0 . 18 – 0 . 36Hz ( n = 77 cells , 11 vessels ) . Since 1 (cid:2) M CCh induced reproducible Ca 2 + transients with distinct Ca 2 + oscillations seen in the major - ity of cells , this concentration was used for the remainder of the study . 3 . 3 . Contribution of ER To identify the ER’s role in the complex Ca 2 + responses induced byCCh , theeffectsofremovalofextracellularCa 2 + forvariableperi - ods of times on the parameters of the Ca 2 + transient induced by an application of CCh were studied . We found that the removal of external Ca 2 + for 1 – 3min had little or no effect on the amplitude of the initial spike and the onset of Ca 2 + oscillations ( Fig . 3Ai ) . How - ever , when the endothelial cells were exposed to Ca 2 + - free solution for 30min or more , this resulted in suppression of Ca 2 + oscillations andreductionofallcomponentsoftheCa 2 + transient ( Fig . 3Aii ) . The amplitude of the initial spike component after 30min exposure to Ca 2 + - free solution was reduced to 78 . 0 ± 2 . 5 % ( n = 27 , P < 0 . 05 ) and after 60min to 62 ± 4 . 2 % ( n = 35 , P < 0 . 05 ) of control , respectively ( Fig . 3B ) . We next investigated the ability of the ER to sustain Ca 2 + sig - nalling responses to CCh in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 + . To do this cells in Ca 2 + - free solution were stimulated by a series of appli - cationsofCChofdifferentdurations ; 10 , 60or120s . Theendothelial cells were exposed to Ca 2 + - free solution for 3min and then stim - ulated by a series of CCh applications ( in 0 - Ca 2 + with 2mM EGTA solution ) and Ca 2 + transients were recorded from a large number of cells using 20 × objective lens . When EC were stimulated by brief ( 10s ) applications of CCh , Ca 2 + transientsandoscillationscouldbeobservedfor15 . 0 ± 2 . 3min ( Fig . 4A ) .

( c and d ) P < 0 . 05 , signiﬁcantly different from control . lost their ability to generate normal Ca 2 + signalling after 3 – 4 CCh applications ( Fig . 4B ) . It can also be seen that the ﬁrst application of CCh induced a normal Ca 2 + spike and initial Ca 2 + oscillations but the sustained component gradually relaxed and late Ca 2 + oscilla - tions were abolished ( Fig . 4B ) . Calcium transients induced by the 2nd and 3rd applications of CCh showed a marked reduction in the amplitude of the initial spike and plateau , and Ca 2 + oscillations were not observed ( Fig . 4B ) , In Ca 2 + - free solution and longer appli - cationofCCh ( 2min ) , onlyoneresponsewasproducedandtheCa 2 + transients spontaneously relaxed to baseline ( Fig . 4C ) . The ability of the EC to respond with regular Ca 2 + transients for 15 – 20min to short applications of CCh in Ca 2 + - free solution ( Figs . 4A and 5A ) , suggests that under these conditions there is a minimal loss of ER Ca 2 + and , that most of the Ca 2 + released from the ER is quickly re - sequestered into the store by SERCA activity . To investigate this , the effects of the SERCA inhibitor CPA on the Ca 2 + transients induced by brief ( 10s ) applications of CCh in Ca 2 + - free solution , were investigated . Exposure of the EC to CPA ( 20 (cid:2) M to maximally inhibit SERCA ) , produced a large increased in Ca 2 + which spontaneously relaxed to the baseline . Subsequent applica - Fig . 4 .

Mumtaz et al . / Cell Calcium 49 ( 2011 ) 66 – 77 71 tions of CCh were ineffective , suggesting depletion of the Ca 2 + store ( Fig . 5B ) . 3 . 4 . Role of phospholipase C and ER release channels The involvement of phospholipase C ( PLC ) in the transduction pathway leading to CCh evoked Ca 2 + transients in EC in Ca 2 + - free solution was studied by using U - 73122 , an inhibitor of PLC activity . Pretreatment of the EC for 30min with U - 73122 ( 50 (cid:2) M ) abolished Ca 2 + transients induced by CCh in Ca 2 + - free solution ( n = 7 vessels , Fig . 6A ) . The possible roles of IP 3 receptor ( IP 3 R ) and ryanodine receptor ( RyR ) channelsintheERCCh - inducedCa 2 + releaseinCa 2 + - free solution was studied by using the ( non - selective ) inhibitor of IP 3 R , 2 - APBandthe ( selective ) inhibitorofRyRchannels , ryanodine . In these experiments EC were pretreated with 2 - APB ( 50 (cid:2) M ) or ryanodine ( 50 (cid:2) M ) for 30min in Ca 2 + - free solution and then stim - ulated with CCh . Since 2 - APB is known to also block Ca 2 + inﬂux from the extracellular space [ 30 , 31 ] , its effect on Ca 2 + release was studied in Ca 2 + - free solution i . e . a protocol similar to that used in Fig . 3 . Pretreatment of the ECs in Ca 2 + - free solution with 2 - APB for 30min abolished CCh - induced Ca 2 + transients ( Fig . 6B ) . Application of CCh following 30min ryanodine pretreatment had little or no effect on CCh - evoked Ca 2 + transient ( n = 11 cells , 3 ves - sels , Fig . 6C ) . This suggests that RyR channels are not involved in CCh - induced Ca 2 + signalling in these EC ( Fig . 6C ) . To conﬁrm this the efﬁcacy of inhibiting RyR channels was tested using caffeine ( 5mM ) and focusing confocally on the smooth muscle cell layer of the artery . Here caffeine induced a large Ca 2 + transient associ - ated with vasoconstriction ( not shown ) , which was abolished by the 30min pre - treatments with ryanodine , suggesting that RyR channels under these conditions are indeed blocked ( Fig . 6D ) . 3 . 5 . Contribution of extracellular calcium To study the role of Ca 2 + inﬂux in the control of Ca 2 + signalling in the intact EC , we used two ( non - selective ) blockers of CCE , La 3 + and Gd 3 + .

( A ) Effects of La 3 + ( 10 (cid:2) M ) on Ca 2 + transients induced by CCh applied for 10 ( i ) , 60 ( ii ) or 120 ( iii ) s , respectively . ( B ) Effects of La 3 + ( 10 (cid:2) M ) on Ca 2 + transient induced by readmission of external Ca 2 + to Ca 2 + - free solution following ER Ca 2 + depletion by either 20 (cid:2) M CPA ( i ) or 1 (cid:2) M CCh ( ii ) applied in Ca 2 + free solution . 72 S . Mumtaz et al . / Cell Calcium 49 ( 2011 ) 66 – 77 short ( 10s ) applications of CCh , suggesting that Ca 2 + inﬂux was not required to maintain Ca 2 + signals , within this period ( Fig . 7A , i ) . In contrast , Ca 2 + transients induced by 1min applications of CCh showed a time dependent inhibition by La 3 + ( Fig . 7A , ii ) ; late Ca 2 + oscillations were inhibited and the plateau was markedly reduced , even in the ﬁrst CCh application . Subsequent applications of CCh showed inhibition of all components of the Ca 2 + transient ( n = 49 cells , 7 vessels , Fig . 7A , ii ) . A 2min application of CCh in the pres - ence of La 3 + evoked Ca 2 + transients which spontaneously relaxed to the baseline ( Fig . 7A , iii ) . Again , the initial Ca 2 + spike and early Ca 2 + oscillations were not affected but late Ca 2 + oscillations were suppressed ( Fig . 7A , iii ) ( n = 21 cell , 5 vessels ) . Similar effects were obtained with Gd 3 + ( data not shown ) . UsingeitheraCPA20 (cid:2) M ( 17cells , 5vessels ) orlongexposureto CCh in Ca 2 + - free solution to deplete the store , produced a substan - tialsustainedriseofintracellularCa 2 + uponreadmissionofexternal Ca 2 + . This Ca 2 + inﬂux was inhibited by 10 (cid:2) M La 3 + ( n = 16 cells , 5 vessels , Fig . 7Bi , ii ) or 1 (cid:2) M Gd 3 + ( data not shown ) . 3 . 6 . Effects of low [ CPA ] on Ca 2 + transients induced by brief applications of carbachol As brief applications of CCh in Ca 2 + - free solution or in La 3 + pro - duced regular Ca 2 + transients , it suggests that the endothelial cells under these conditions maintain normal Ca 2 + signalling , as long as SERCA is functional ( see Figs . 5A and 7A , i ) . Thus with brief applica - tionsofCChinCa 2 + - freesolution , eithertheamountofCa 2 + released from the ER is small and / or SERCA activity is high enough so that most of the Ca 2 + released is taken back into the ER , keeping luminal level of Ca 2 + above the threshold of activation of CCE . To test this hypothesis in the next series of experiments the effects of short application of CCh on Ca 2 + transients in the presence of low con - centrations of CPA ( 5 (cid:2) M ) were studied , in the presence and the absence of external Ca 2 + and in the presence of CCE blockers . Fig . 8 shows Ca 2 + transients produced by these conditions , with ( Fig . 8A ) and without ( Fig . 8B ) external Ca 2 + . As was shown previously ( e . g . Fig . 4 ) and in Fig . 8A , applications of CCh produced Ca 2 + transients the duration of which correlated well with the duration of the CCh pulse . The EC were then exposed to 5 (cid:2) M CPA for 30s and then in the continuous presence of CPA , stimulated further by brief appli - cations of CCh . We found that even after this brief exposure to CPA the ﬁrst application of CCh evoked larger Ca 2 + transients ( Fig . 8A ) . With CPA the duration of the Ca 2 + transient was no longer lim - ited by the time of application of CCh . After removal of the agonist Ca 2 + remained elevated for 30 – 40s before relaxing to a new steady state baseline ( Fig . 8A ) . In the presence of CPA the duration of the plateau , measured at 50 % of the peak amplitude , was increased 2 . 1 ± 0 . 4 times and its amplitude to 2 . 2 ± 0 . 44 times ( n = 31 , 5 ves - sels , P < 0 . 05 ) relativetocontrol ( Fig . 8A ) . Theamplitudeofthespike component evoked by the ﬁrst application of CCh in the presence of CPA was also increased 1 . 2 ± 0 . 1 times , P < 0 . 05 . These data show that a large part of the sustained component of the CCh - induced Ca 2 + transient was observed after removal of CCh from the media , whichintheabsenceofCPAproducedaquickrelaxationoftheCa 2 + transient ( Fig . 8A ) . This suggests that this part of the Ca 2 + transient could be due to activation of CCE , which remains open for longer period of times due to the slowed operation of the SERCA . To test this we performed the same experiments but in Ca 2 + - free solution or in the presence of CCE blockers . Fig . 8B shows typical traces of the Ca 2 + transients induced by brief applications of CCh in Ca 2 + - free solution ( n = 27 cells , 5 vessel ) or in the presence of 10 (cid:2) M La 3 + ( n = 18 cells , 4 vessels , Fig . 8C ) . It illustrates that in the absence of external Ca 2 + or in the presence of La 3 + , CCh stimulation of the EC in the presence of CPA , produced brief spike - like Ca 2 + transients with no plateau component ( Fig . 8B , C ) . Also , EC now were unable to respond with Ca 2 + transients when stimulated by a series of brief CCh applications . It was also noticeable that the amplitude of the spike component evoked by the ﬁrst application of CCh in Fig . 8 .

Role of SERCA in control of Ca 2 + spike and Ca 2 + oscillations The data obtained in the presence of low concentration of [ CPA ] showed that the amplitude of the spike component induced by the ﬁrst application of CCh , in the presence or the absence of external Ca 2 + , was always increased and Ca 2 + oscillations abolished ( Fig . 8 ) . These data suggest that SERCA acts as a negative feedback mecha - nism controlling the characteristics of Ca 2 + spikes and oscillations , by quickly buffering cytoplasmic Ca 2 + released from the ER .

Dataarepresented in Fig . 9 . As already described ( Figs . 2 and 4 ) CCh produced Ca 2 + tran - sients with oscillations superimposing on the plateau component , in the presence and absence of external Ca 2 + .

( B ) Representative graph showing activation of Ca 2 + entry induced by combined action of CPA and CCh in the presence of external Ca 2 + . ( For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure legend , the reader is referred to the web version of the article . ) in the presence of external Ca 2 + brief ( 20 – 30s ) pre - treatment of the EC with 5 (cid:2) M CPA produced an increase in the amplitude and duration of the initial Ca 2 + spike and plateau and inhibition of Ca 2 + oscillations . The amplitude of the initial component was increased 1 . 2 ± 0 . 1times control and plateau 2 . 9 ± 0 . 4 times ( n = 37 cells , 7 vessels , P < 0 . 05 ) . Also , as was the case with brief applications of CCh ( Fig . 8A ) , its removal did not terminate the Ca 2 + transient ; these lasted for an additional 30 – 50s before gradually relaxing to new baseline ( Fig . 9A ) . As already discussed , EC pre - exposed to Ca 2 + - free solution for 1 – 3min retained their ability to gener - ate early Ca 2 + oscillations ( Fig . 9B , top trace ) . However , if EC were pretreated for 30s with CPA before CCh stimulation , Ca 2 + oscil - lations in Ca 2 + - free solution were also abolished ( n = 45 cells , 5 vessels , Fig . 9B , bottom trace ) . Again the amplitude of the spike component was increased 1 . 19 ± 0 . 12 times ( n = 17 cells , 3 vessels , P < 0 . 05 ) . In order to study the effects of SERCA on the parameters of the Ca 2 + spike , EC were stimulated in Ca 2 + - free solution with brief ( 3 – 5s ) applications of CCh . Although the number of cells respond - ing to CCh was decreased , we could still identify cells producing Ca 2 + transients consisting of initial Ca 2 + spikes ( Fig . 10A ) . The advantage of these experiments was that in the absence of exter - nal Ca 2 + , EC could respond with regular Ca 2 + spikes for 20 – 25min with minimal decrease in their amplitude ( Fig . 10A ) . Addition of 5 (cid:2) M CPA to Ca 2 + - free solution 30s before the next brief applica - tion of CCh , increased the amplitude and duration of the Ca 2 + spike ( Fig . 10A and B ) . The duration of the Ca 2 + spike measured at 50 % of the peak amplitude was increased by CPA 3 . 4 ± 0 . 3 times ( n = 9 cells , 2 vessels , P < 0 . 05 ) . The duration of the Ca 2 + spike evoked by the second application of CCh , in the presence of CPA , was increased further ( Fig . 10A ) . Fig . 10B shows superimposed records of the last and the ﬁrst Ca 2 + spikes recorded before and after CPA , on an expanded time scale . It can be clearly seen that the amplitudeanddurationoftheCa 2 + spikeinducedbythebriefappli - cation of CCh in Ca 2 + - free solution , in the presence of CPA , were increased . 3 . 8 . Evidence for the presence of STIM 1 Our data suggest involvement of a Ca 2 + release / entry cou - pling mechanism in the control of Ca 2 + signalling in EC of tail artery . Although we did not undertake a systematic study on the physiological conditions involving STIM / Orai interaction , we used antibodies against STIM 1 for immunohistochemistry . We found ( Fig . 11A ) that STIM 1 is present in the EC of these vessels . It was homogenously distributed in the EC before stimulation ( Fig . 11A , left hand side ) , but appears as puncta following depletion of the ER by a combined action of CPA and CCh ( Fig . 11A , right hand side ) . The combined action of CCh and CPA ( bottom panel ) was used in these experiments to maximally deplete the store and activate Ca entry via SOC ( Fig . 11B ) . 4 . Discussion The intact endothelium of tail artery was amenable to study with confocal microscopy and produced reproducible Ca 2 + signal for 2 – 3h . Clear Ca 2 + signals were obtained without contamina - tion from myocytes . Given the caveats that have arisen about using isolated or cultured endothelial cells for studying Ca 2 + sig - nalling [ 32 – 35 ] , we suggest this is a good model for studying intact endothelium of macrovessels . Our data reveal that , in the intact rat tail artery preparation , manyaspectsofthecomplexCa 2 + signalinECproducedinresponse to agonist stimulation are generated without the need for Ca 2 + entry , as continuous cycles of IP 3 - induced ER Ca 2 + release and SERCA uptake occur . We discuss our ﬁndings in the context of previous data . 4 . 1 . Importance of SERCA Our major ﬁnding concerns the large role of SERCA in govern - ing the responses of the endothelium to CCh and switching CCE on and off . SERCA binds and hence buffers cytoplasmic Ca 2 + and S . Mumtaz et al . / Cell Calcium 49 ( 2011 ) 66 – 77 75 acts as a powerful negative feedback mechanism controlling the amplitudeanddurationoftheinitialCa 2 + spikeandearlyCa 2 + oscil - lations . EvenbriefexposureofECtolowconcentrationoftheSERCA pump inhibitor CPA , markedly increases the amplitude of the Ca 2 + spikeandblocksCa 2 + oscillations . ThisbufferingbySERCAprevents activation of CCE during brief applications of CCh , allowing EC to sustain Ca 2 + oscillations in Ca 2 + - free solution for 15 – 20min . A sim - ilar conclusion was reached by Kwan et al . , 1990 in lacrimal acinar cells [ 49 ] . However , longer application of CCh ( > 20s ) causes partial depletion of the ER , resulting in activation of CCE . Inactivation of CCE is fast as SERCA takes up Ca 2 + , as also shown in patch clamp studies in other types of cells [ 26 , 27 ] . SERCA effectively buffers this Ca 2 + entry by binding ( and then transporting it into the ER lumen ) [ 36 ] so that when the agonist is removed , CCE is terminated and thereisrapidrelaxationoftheCa 2 + signalling . WhenSERCAactivity is decreased by CPA , stimulation of EC , even with brief applications of CCh , now results in activation of CCE , and the channels remain open after removal of CCh . 4 . 2 . SERCA and CCE The ﬁnding that low [ CPA ] potentiated the initial spike and blocked Ca 2 + oscillations suggests that Ca 2 + is continuously cycling across the ER . The Ca 2 + efﬂux through IP 3 R is most likely coun - tered by reuptake via SERCA and thus short applications of CCh are not enough to reach the threshold for CCE activation . Our results indicate that it is SERCA activity that prevents CCE activation . It might seem surprising that SERCA can maintain a sufﬁcient Ca 2 + store content to prevent CCE activation in the face of continuous Ca 2 + release via open IP 3 R . Our data are again in good agree - ment with those of Parekh and his group who found that SERCA pumps were remarkably effective in RBL - 1 cells and could pre - vent I CRAC from activating , despite signiﬁcant Ca 2 + leakage from the stores and a cytosolic Ca 2 + binding ratio of between 2000 and 5000 ( more than two orders of magnitude greater than within the stores ) [ 25 ] . Small changes in ambient luminal and cytosolic Ca 2 + could also have signiﬁcant effects on SERCA pump activity as was shown in pancreatic acinar cells [ 37 ] . Small ( two fold ) rises of cytosolic Ca 2 + stimulated SERCA activity almost 10 fold [ 38 , 39 ] . Thus , changes in SERCA - mediated uptake will have quite dramatic effects on the activation of CCE . Our data are in good agreement with ﬁnding that SERCA is the most important component in the control of the kineticsofCa 2 + wavepropagationinXenopusoocytes , whereitwas shown that the frequency of IP 3 - induced Ca 2 + waves is controlled by SERCA [ 40 ] . 4 . 3 . Calcium oscillations The Ca 2 + oscillations in the intact EC in tail artery seen in Ca 2 + - free solution are best explained as follows : the IP 3 receptor channels need to be sensitized to release Ca 2 + periodically by cycli - cal ﬂuctuations of Ca 2 + within the lumen of the ER . Each pulse of released Ca 2 + leads to a decrease in luminal Ca 2 + which has to be replenished before the IP 3 R are re - sensitized to deliver the next pulse of Ca 2 + . It is this loading of the ER that explains why the early and the late Ca 2 + oscillations were quickly abolished even by low [ CPA ] . Entry of external Ca 2 + , which occurs mainly through CCE channels , combined with SERCA activity , determines the rate of store re - loading responsible for adjusting the sensitivity of the IP 3 receptors to maintain late Ca 2 + oscillations . The expression and distribution of different isoforms of IP 3 R and SERCA , as well as pos - sible sub - divisions within the ER , are probably important for the ﬁne tuning and kinetics of these events [ 41 – 44 ] , but were not part of the present study . Intracellular Ca 2 + oscillations commonly results from lower ( physiological ) concentrations of agonists in many kinds of cells [ 45 – 48 ] . These oscillations depend upon complex mechanisms of regenerative intracellular signalling and generally do not persist in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 + , leading to the conclusion that entry of Ca 2 + across the plasma membrane plays a signiﬁcant role in either their initiation or maintenance . In this study , we have demonstrated that early Ca 2 + oscillations in ECs of intact rat tail artery are not driven by Ca 2 + entry , but rather depend upon Ca 2 + release / Ca 2 + uptake coupling while late Ca 2 + oscillations require Ca 2 + entry for their maintenance . The present study demonstrates that CCE is the underlying mechanism of calcium entry that is required to sustain late CCh - induced [ Ca 2 + ] i oscillations in ECs of intact rat tail artery . The observation that CCh - induced Ca 2 + spike and early Ca 2 + oscillations can be observed in Ca 2 + - free solution suggests that the mechanisms triggering initial spike and early calcium oscillations are intrinsic to the intracellular milieu and that the role of calcium entry is primarily to replenish any ions lost from the cytoplasm . Late Ca 2 + oscillations are more com - plex and involve interplay between Ca 2 + release and Ca 2 + entry , working in series with SERCA . However , with long applications of CCh EC lose their ability to sustain late Ca 2 + oscillations which suggests that under these conditions Ca 2 + inﬂux is required to maintain normal Ca 2 + signalling . In agreement with other stud - ies we ﬁnd CCE is the only physiological mechanism of calcium entry supporting late Ca 2 + oscillations in intact ECs of large arteries [ 49 , 50 ] . 4 . 4 . Capacitative calcium entry These data indicate that in the presence of low [ CPA ] , a Ca 2 + inﬂux pathway is activated by brief applications of CCh and remained functional for a considerable time after agonist removal , and thus suggests it is not directly regulated by a receptor operated channel . SelectiveinhibitionoftheCCEpathwaybyLa 3 + orGd 3 + rel - ative speciﬁc blockers of CCE in EC [ 51 ] , suggest that the sustained component of the Ca 2 + transient , seen after removal of CCh from the media was due to Ca 2 + inﬂux via CCE . We found that with low [ CPA ] , EC in Ca 2 + - free solution could generate only 3 – 4 Ca 2 + tran - sients . This suggests that some SERCA activity remained , but was not high enough to counter Ca 2 + release and Ca 2 + leak from the ER , and thus eventually the ER Ca 2 + store becomes depleted . The ability of EC to regularly respond to short applications of CCh in the presence of low [ CPA ] and external Ca 2 + , suggest that the ER or some of its portions are reﬁlled and could be released by subse - quent applications of an agonist . Because there is continued partial inhibition a new steady state base line is set which reﬂects the new equilibrium between Ca 2 + leak and Ca 2 + uptake . It is interesting to also note that TRCP4 , one of the main candidates ROC channel in EC [ 52 ] is potentiated by La 3 + [ 53 ] . This discrepancy with the inhi - bition of Ca signals which we saw , may be due to differences in preparations , as we used intact endothelium , but may also suggest that in our preparation , with muscarinic activation , most of the Ca entry is via CCE . 4 . 5 . STIM Recent data indicate that activation of CCE ( CRAC ) channels by store depletion involves the redistribution of the ER Ca 2 + sensor , stromal interaction molecule 1 ( STIM1 ) , to peripheral sites where it co - clusters with the channel subunit , Orai1 [ 18 – 20 ] . After ER Ca 2 + store depletion , STIM clusters are found in the ER , close enough to the cell surface to allow for direct interaction with plasma membraneproteins . TheCRACchannelactivationinvolvesphysical migration of ER - resident STIM to ER – plasma membrane junctions 76 S . Mumtaz et al . / Cell Calcium 49 ( 2011 ) 66 – 77 and subsequent aggregation of the Ca 2 + inﬂux channel . So STIM serves as a Ca 2 + sensor and messenger at the same time as it also organizes Orai subunits into adjacent plasma membrane clusters [ 54 ] . The clusters of messenger STIM and corresponding Orai chan - nel proteins have been termed the ‘elementary unit’ of CCE and CRAC channel activation , as Ca 2 + inﬂux through CRAC channels occurs precisely at STIM – Orai clusters [ 1 ] . In ECs CCE has been reported for several different vascular beds [ 51 , 55 , 56 ] , although as with many other cell types , recording of their inward current ( I CRAC ) are scarce , due presumably to its small size . Although there is still some debate over the molecular identity of CCE channels , we were able to demonstrate expression and redistribution of STIM1 in native EC . This is consistent with the recent ﬁndings of [ 57 ] in proliferating EC who established the requirement of STIM1 / Orai1 for CCE . Levels of Stim1 were reported by this group to quite low , but they were able to also measure I CRAC . 5 . Summary In conclusion we have been able to study Ca 2 + signalling in response to agonist in intact endothelium from tail artery . We demonstrate alterations in the components of the Ca 2 + sig - nals depending upon concentration and duration of agonists and describe the mechanisms involved in generating the different components , spike , oscillations and plateau , of the Ca 2 + signal . Importantly we have found that SERCA activity plays an important role in shaping the Ca 2 + signals but also in turning CCE on and off . Thus agonist modulation of SERCA activity may be a mechanism of affecting endothelium function in vivo . Conﬂict of interest The authors do not have any conﬂict of interest .
