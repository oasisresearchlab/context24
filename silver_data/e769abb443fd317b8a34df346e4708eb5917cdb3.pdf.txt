The role of inactivated vaccines and ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccination within - household transmission prevention remains unknown . Methods : This observational , case - control study tracked 408 SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - confirmed index cases from April to September 2021 . This study aimed to prove the benefit of inactivated and ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccinated index cases in preventing within - household transmissibility . 2 Results : A total of 1 , 178 household contacts were investigated . Of the 231 index cases vaccinated with inactivated or ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccine , 177 were unvaccinated . Vaccinated index cases exhibited a 7 . 8 % risk reduction in household transmission . There was no difference in SAR of 50 . 77 % in unvaccinated compared with 46 . 81 % in vaccinated index cases ( p = 0 . 177 ) . The completed 2 - dose SARS - CoV - 12 vaccinated index case demonstrated 93 % reduced household transmissibility within 14 - 90 days . The effectiveness for preventing household transmission was 26 . 09 % . The 87 % reduced risk of household transmissibility was observed , among - mask wearers . Conclusions : The completed 2 - dose SARS - CoV - 2 inactivated and ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccination within 14 - 90 days of index cases demonstrated benefits in preventing within - household transmissibility . Implementing high - efficacy vaccination and an appropriate booster dose can prevent household transmission . Keywords inactivated vaccine , SARS - CoV - 2 , COVID - 19 , ChAdOx1 nCOV - 19 , household transmission Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) developed from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) infection , causing a pandemic and high mortality . Household transmission is the most common transmission source in outbreak countries . ( Pollán et al . , 2020 ) . In England , the secondary infection rate is 4 – 6 . 4 per 100 households ( Hall et al . , 2021 ) . The secondary attack rate ( SAR ) in other countries is 16 . 3 - 53 % ( Grijalva et al . , 2020 ; Li et al . , 2020 ; Singanayagam et al . , 2021 ) . The systematic review demonstrated an average of 17 % secondary infection ( 4 - 45 % ) , and SAR was 31 . 1 % during the B . 1 . 617 . 2 outbreak , while the high transmissibility in Thai households was 56 % ( Madewell et al . , 2021 ; Madewell et al . , 2020 ; Watanapokasin et al . , 2021 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 vaccination is the best modality to prevent SARS - CoV - 2 infection and has been shown to reduce its severity and mortality . A study in ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 or BNT162b2 vaccinated index cases > 21 days found 10 % of secondary cases and a 40 - 50 % reduction in infected household contacts . Secondary cases and SAR were 196 ( 5 . 7 % ) and 371 ( 6 . 2 % ) in households with ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 and BNT162b2 vaccinated index cases ( Harris et al . , 2021 ) . The effectiveness of BNT162b2 and mRNA - 1273 in households was 8 . 7 % and 42 . 9 % between two and ten weeks after the first dose of vaccinated index cases , and effectiveness of preventing transmission was 63 % in unvaccinated and 40 % in vaccinated households ( Salo et al . , 2021 ) . Israeli data showed 88 . 5 % effectiveness of BNT162b2 against transmission ( Prunas et al . , 2021 ) . Moreover , a UK study demonstrated that SAR for B . 1 . 617 . 2 variant in vaccinated was 25 % and 38 % in unvaccinated cases ( Singanayagam et al . , 2021 ) . A community study found a robust negative association between vaccination rates and a 2 - fold decreased positive test fraction of unvaccinated community members ( Milman et al . , 2021 ) . This 3 study focused on inactivated SARS - CoV - 2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccination index cases to prevent household transmissibility . Methods Patients All 793 SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - confirmed cases were retrospectively reviewed in electronic medical records from April to September 2021 in Chulabhorn Hospital , Bangkok , Thailand , during the B . 1 . 617 . 2 and B . 1 . 1 . 7 variant outbreaks ( Figure 1 ) . The 408 index cases were identified , excluding non - index cases , index without household members , who had experienced mRNA or viral vector vaccines , previously received antiviral agents or passive antibodies , namely convalescent plasma , monoclonal antibodies , hyperimmune globulin , and hydroxychloroquine / chloroquine prophylaxis within 60 days , resident in nursing care facilities , and who did not cooperate with the given personnel data . ( Figure 2 ) The close contact households were defined as members who lived less than 6 feet away from index cases for at least ten minutes in the last 14 days without any suspected another index case . Secondary household infection was defined by the World Health Organization 2020 . The confirmed cases were close contact households positive for RT - PCR or SARS - CoV - 2 antigen rapid diagnosis test ( RDT ) with or without symptoms . The probable cases were household contacts consistent with clinical criteria , including respiratory symptoms or chest roentgenogram compatible with COVID - 19 , while the suspected cases were symptomatic close contact individuals . Trial procedure This retrospective , case - control study compared index cases experienced and unexperienced with the CoronaVac , BBIBP - CorV , and ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccines , which were authorized for vaccination in Thailand during the study period . Baseline characteristic data , subvariants , and cycle threshold ( Ct ) values were collected using contact tracking records and electronic data review . All index cases provided informed consent and were interviewed about the vaccination and household history by telephone and electronic questionnaires . This clinical trial was registered in the Thai Clinical Trials Registry ( TCTR ) no . TCTR20211108003 . Statistical analysis Categorical data and baseline characteristics were analyzed using the chi - square test or Fisher ' s exact test . Non - normally distributed continuous data were compared using the Mann – Whitney U test for multiple groups . The calculated sample size in this study was 208 to detect differences in SAR between vaccinated and unvaccinated index cases , with 80 % power and an alpha error of 0 . 05 . Continuous , non - normally distributed data are presented as median ( interquartile range [ IQR ] ) and were analyzed using the Mann - Whitney U test . The adjusted odds ratio ( aOR ) of any factor between vaccinated and unvaccinated infected households was analyzed using multilevel logistic regression . Statistical significance was defined as a two - sided 4 P - value < 0 . 05 , and all statistical analyses were performed using STATA , version 16 . 1 ( StataCorp , College Station , TX , USA ) . RESULTS Baseline characteristics Of the 408 primary cases , 177 ( 43 . 38 % ) were unvaccinated . 231 ( 56 . 62 % ) were vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 and inactivated vaccines , namely , CoronaVac and BBIBP - CorV vaccines . All cases were Thai from June to August 2021 and peaked in July to August 2021 during the B . 1 . 617 . 2 outbreak and the recent CoronaVac and ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccination . The majority of variants of concern ( VOC ) consisted of B . 1 . 617 . 2 ( 14 . 9 % ) , followed by B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( 5 . 15 % ) , despite 79 . 66 % of unknown variants . Nucleocapsid IgG antibodies were more positive in the vaccinated index cases ( p = 0 . 001 ) . Unvaccinated index cases had more moderate and severe / critical COVID - 19 71 . 89 % and 2 . 16 % , respectively ( p = 0 . 013 ) . The symptomatic vaccinated index cases had higher nasal discharges ( p = 0 . 006 ) . Most of the index cases were vaccinated < 14 days ( 42 . 86 % ) , 14 - 90 days ( 55 . 68 % ) , and a majority of CoronaVac , followed by ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 . Half of the vaccinated and unvaccinated index cases shared bedrooms and bathrooms with the household members . ( Table1 , Supplementary ; Table1 ) Among 1 , 178 within - household close contact cases , 572 were compatible with the SARS - CoV - 2 infection definition : 308 secondary cases from vaccinated index cases and 264 from unvaccinated individuals . Almost all confirmed household contacts were detected by SARS - CoV - 2 antigen RDT . There were high numbers of unvaccinated household contacts , 41 . 4 % and 76 . 54 % in vaccinated and unvaccinated index cases . ( Supplementary , Table2 ) SAR in fully CoronaVac vaccinated > 14 days was 46 % lower than 53 % of fully ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccinated > 14 days . ( Supplementary ; Table3 ) Outcomes The overall SAR of household contacts was 46 . 81 % in unvaccinated and 50 . 77 % vaccinated index cases ( p = 0 . 177 ) . The relative risk reduction of households that contacted the vaccinated index cases was 7 . 8 % . The SAR in household contact was 64 . 71 % , 40 % , and 81 . 25 % in vaccinated index cases who received completed 2 - dose vaccination < 14 days , 14 - 90 days , and > 90 days , respectively . Despite the high SAR in each VOC , the study could not demonstrate SAR differences between the vaccinated and unvaccinated index cases . The symptomatic index cases had more risk of transmissibility than asymptomatic individuals ( odds ratio ( OR ) 3 . 19 , 95 % CI ( 1 . 23 , 8 . 25 ) ) , which demonstrated decreased transmissibility in afebrile individuals and who absence of cough with OR 0 . 44 ; 95 % CI [ 0 . 20 , 0 . 95 ] and OR 0 . 43 ; 95 % CI ( 0 . 20 , 0 . 93 ) , respectively . The SAR was peak during 24 - 48 hours from onset of symptoms , and SAR was lower in vaccinated ( 50 . 43 % ) than unvaccinated index cases ( 65 . 71 % ) ( p = 0 . 042 ) . ( Table2 , Supplementary ; Table4 , 5 ) . 5 Vaccine - associated factors were also analyzed . The index cases who had complete 2 - dose of any inactivated vaccine and ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccination within 14 - 90 days reduced SARS - CoV - 2 transmissibility risk ( OR 0 . 29 , 95 % CI ( 0 . 09 , 0 . 92 ) , p = 0 . 035 ) ; aOR 0 . 07 , 95 % CI ( 0 . 01 , 0 . 78 ) ) , and SAR was 40 % in completed vaccinated within 14 - 90 days and 50 . 77 % in unvaccinated index cases . The ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccinated index cases reduced transmissibility after the first dose < 14 days ( aOR 0 . 002 , 95 % CI ( 0 . 000 , 0 . 295 ) ) and < 14 days after second dose ( aOR 0 . 042 , 95 % CI ( 0 . 003 , 0 . 638 ) ) . The SAR in ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccinated index case was 56 . 1 % after the first dose < 14 days , but SAR after the second dose was too small sample size . ( Table2 , Supplementary ; Table5 ) The completed 2 - dose CoronaVac vaccination within 14 - 90 days demonstrated significantly reduced household transmissibility 69 % ( OR 0 . 31 , 95 % CI ( 0 . 10 , 0 . 97 ) , p = 0 . 045 ) . In contrast , the completed second dose CoronaVac of index cases < 14 days demonstrated an increased risk of transmissibility ( OR 77 . 82 , 95 % CI ( 2 . 22 , 2 , 728 . 76 ) , P = 0 . 016 ) . ( Supplementary ; Table6 ) The SAR was lower in the vaccinated index cases who presented 24 - 48 hours after the onset of symptoms of index cases ( p = 0 . 042 ) . In severe and critical illnesses , vaccinated index cases showed lower SAR ( 30 % ) compared with unvaccinated ( 83 . 33 % ) ( p = 0 . 027 ) . The asymptomatic vaccinated index cases did not demonstrate decreased within - household transmissibility . The SAR for Ct values < 20 , 21 - 30 , and > 30 were 55 . 15 % , 44 . 38 % , and 43 . 40 % , respectively , without affecting the risk of transmissibility in the different Ct values of index cases . The lower SAR of household contacts in vaccinated index cases aged 11 - 20 , 21 - 30 , and 41 - 50 years old than unvaccinated individuals and 41 - 50 - year - old showed vaccinated index cases reduced transmissibility ( aOR 0 . 16 , 95 % CI ( 0 . 03 , 0 . 98 ) ) . Vaccinated index cases aged 21 - 30 years had a lower SAR ( p < 0 . 001 ) , while vaccinated index cases with 61 - 70 years old had a higher SAR ( p = 0 . 003 ) . Transmissibility was increased when vaccinated index cases aged 41 - 50 and 51 - 60 years old ( aOR 7 . 73 , 95 % CI ( 1 . 01 , 22 . 17 ) ; aOR 9 . 94 ( 1 . 35 , 73 . 12 ) ) . ( Table 2 ) The SAR was increased in unvaccinated index cases with age > 70 - year - old ( 69 . 23 % ) , households aged 11 - 20 - year - old ( 63 . 63 % ) , severe or critical illness ( 83 . 33 % ) , who shared bedrooms after being diagnosed with either a shared bathroom or not . In the vaccinated index 6 case , increased SAR was found in those who received the 1 - dose of CoronaVac < 14 days ( 60 % ) , complete 2 - dose vaccinated > 90 days ( 81 . 25 % ) , received the 2 - dose CoronaVac < 14 days ( 93 . 75 % ) , and > 90 days ( 81 . 25 % ) , and who shared bedrooms with separated bathrooms or not ( 85 . 71 % ) . ( Table2 , Supplementary ; Table5 ) Overall vaccine effectiveness in preventing household transmission was 26 . 09 % , 95 % CI ( 21 . 57 - 30 . 61 ) . The fully 2 - dose vaccine effectiveness was 23 . 59 , 95 % CI ( 14 . 04 - 33 . 14 ) and 5 . 72 , 95 % CI ( 0 . 00 - 13 . 64 ) in < 14 days , > 14 days after the second dose , respectively . ( Supplementary ; Table7 ) The SAR of the index vaccinated wearing the face mask was 33 . 48 % compared to 43 . 94 % of unvaccinated individuals . Observation among those who were vaccinated and wearing face masks showed 87 % reduced transmissibility ( aOR 0 . 13 , 95 % CI ( 0 . 04 , 0 . 43 ) , while the non - wearing masks were at risk of transmissibility 7 . 56 times ( aOR 7 . 56 , 95 % CI ( 2 . 35 , 24 . 34 ) ) . After primary cases were diagnosed , prompt separated bedrooms and bathrooms demonstrated reduced transmissibility ( aOR 0 . 56 , 95 % CI ( 0 . 01 , 0 . 38 ) ) . Quarantine in facilities reduced transmissibility ( aOR , 0 . 05 ; 95 % CI ( 0 . 01 , 0 . 35 ) ) . ( Table 2 , Supplementary ; Table5 ) Discussion During the SARS - CoV - 2 outbreak that attacked Bangkok , B . 1 . 617 . 2 rapidly increased and predominated in July 2021 , resulting in enormous health care burdens . ( Department of Medical Sciences , Ministry of Publec Health , Variant of Concern Surveillance , 2021 ) . Recent studies demonstrated the efficacy of BNT162b2 and mRNA - 1273 could reduce household transmission in vaccinated index cases with a 55 % risk reduction ( 14 ) . Our novel data demonstrated that two completed 2 - dose inactivated or ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccinated index cases within 14 - 90 days reduced within - household transmissibility . The risk reduction was 7 . 8 % , less than the previous study ( Ng et al . , 2021 ) . However , there were more unvaccinated household contacts in unvaccinated index cases than vaccinated index cases , resulting in a high SAR without demonstrating the difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated index cases , which is consistent with a UK study ( Singanayagam et al . , 2021 ) . In addition to vaccination issues , Thai households were crowded with extended families , multi - generation members , a culture with a meal together , low socioeconomic status , and more than half sharing bedrooms and bathrooms . Despite no different property types and the number of household members indicating increased transmissibility , recent studies have shown that high - inoculum households with limited living spaces have increased transmissibility . ( Cerami et al . , 2021 ) . These constituent effects might explain the rapid , extensive household transmissibility and widespread transmission with SAR above 50 % in Thai households . Our results showed that the vaccine effectiveness in preventing within - household transmission after the first dose of mostly ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 and Coronavac vaccine < 14 days and > 14 days was 35 . 56 % and 13 . 33 % . While The very low vaccine effectiveness after the 7 second dose , mostly CoronaVac , < 14 days and > 14 days were 5 . 72 % and 23 . 59 % , respectively . Only a full dose of CoronaVac within 14 - 90 days diminished the risk of household transmissibility in close contacts and the effect after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 . The increased risk of transmission of CoronaVac - vaccinated index cases demonstrated the relatively low effectiveness of CoronaVac after the second dose of < 14 days . Recent studies showed that one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 might have 30 % effectiveness among the B . 1 . 617 . 2 and 48 . 7 % among the Alpha variant . The effectiveness of two doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccine was 74 . 5 % among the B . 1 . 1 . 7 and 67 % among the B . 1 . 617 . 2 variant ( Lopez Bernal , Andrews , Gower , Gallagher , et al . , 2021 ) . However , the SAR in unvaccinated Delta - exposed contacts was 25 . 8 % , and effectiveness in complete vaccination was 56 . 4 % . A previous study could not demonstrate an association between vaccinated index cases and SARS - CoV - 2 acquisition in contact cases ( Ng et al . , 2021 ) . Our study implied that SARS - CoV - 2 acquisition by household contacts depended on the duration after vaccination and the efficacy and type of vaccines . The very high SAR in those who received the 1 - dose < 14 days of CoronaVac and 2 - dose > 90 days was 93 . 75 % and 81 . 25 % , respectively , which might be from the waning immunity . Although the neutralizing antibodies might be persistent six months after the second dose , the geometric mean plaque reduction neutralization test ( PRNT ) 50 and PRNT90 were relatively low after the first and second doses of CoronaVac compared with BNT162b2 , implying substantially lower effectiveness of Coronavac for the prevention of symptomatic cases and protection of transmission . Therefore , a study recommended a third dose of CoronaVac 2 months after the second dose to achieve a protective immunity level . ( Lim et al . , 2021 ; Zeng et al . , 2021 ) . Encouraging awareness and implementing basic infection prevention measures after complete vaccination should be a concern . However , no significant difference in SAR and reduced transmissibility among BBIBP - CorV and the second dose ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccines might be a limitation from a small population due to the early period of vaccines implemented in Thailand . The ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccine showed 99 % reduced transmissibility after the first dose < 14 days , corresponding with the UK data found 5 . 7 % secondary cases and 48 % transmissibility reduction ( aOR 0 . 52 , 95 % CI ( 0 . 43 – 0 . 62 ) ) in households with ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccine ≥21 days vaccinated index cases compared with 10 . 1 % secondary cases in the unvaccinated group ( Harris et al . , 2021 ) . These findings correlated with immunogenicity studies and proved that ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 demonstrated substantial vaccine effectiveness early 0 - 3 , 10 - 13 days after the first dose vaccination ( Lopez Bernal , Andrews , Gower , Robertson , et al . , 2021 ) . The nucleocapsid IgG antibodies were more positive in the vaccinated index cases than in the unvaccinated index cases , implying a possible longer duration of transmissibility in the vaccinated index cases . Although more natural antibodies were produced in vaccinated index cases , there was no difference in SAR between seropositive and seronegative index cases . Our data suggested that the high SAR was within 0 - 72 hours and peaked 24 - 48 hours after the onset of symptoms . However , vaccinated index cases had milder and less moderate illnesses than 8 unvaccinated index cases , which was not demonstrated in the HOSTED study ( Hall et al . , 2021 ; Li et al . , 2021 ) . Severe and critical COVID - 19 also had more transmissibility than the others , implying that severe illness might have more symptoms , less immunity , and possibly delayed viral clearance . Transmissibility evidence shows that infectiousness depends on local immunity rather than the quantitative virus ( Luo et al . , 2021 ) . Vaccinated recipients with breakthrough infections may have more rapid viral clearance than unvaccinated individuals ( Chia et al . , 2021 ; Kissler et al . , 2021 ) . However , only 0 . 4 % of symptomatic vaccinated index cases had a duration from onset of symptoms > 72 h . The possible hypothesis was that asymptomatic index cases had a low risk of transmission being afebrile , absence of cough could reduce transmissibility , or negligible risk of silent transmission and might be an advantage from vaccination , although prolonged living duration in households before patients seek the doctor . The study failed to show that lower Ct values or different VOCs affected increasing within - household transmissibility , in contrast with NHS data , which demonstrated that the B . 1 . 617 . 2 caused an increased transmissibility within - household contacts compared to the B . 1 . 1 . 7 variant ( OR 1 . 7 , 95 % CI ( 1 . 48 - 1 . 95 ) ) ( Allen et al . , 2021 ; Ng et al . , 2021 ; Singanayagam et al . , 2021 ) . Although , The SAR of the B . 1 . 617 . 2 variant was 49 . 7 % in our study . According to the Department of Medical Sciences Ministry of Public Health data , in Thailand , the B . 1 . 617 . 2 occupied more than 95 % since July ( Department of Medical Sciences , Ministry of Publec Health , Variant of Concern Surveillance , 2021 ) . The very high SAR in unvaccinated index cases with age > 70 - year - old , severe illness may be associated with dependent functional status and comorbidities . The high SAR in households aged 11 - 20 - year - old affected by in - school transmission ( Giardina et al . , 2021 ) . While vaccinated index cases had higher SAR among 61 - 70 - year - old might be due to the immunosenescence effect ( Ranzani et al . , 2021 ) . Transmissibility was increased when vaccinated index cases aged 41 - 50 and 51 - 60 years old ( aOR 7 . 73 , 95 % CI ( 1 . 01 , 22 . 17 ) ; aOR 9 . 94 ( 1 . 35 , 73 . 12 ) ) , although no association was found and differed from the previous result that revealed less susceptibility , more infectiousness in children and adolescents ( Chu et al . , 2021 ; Li et al . , 2021 ) . Non - wearing face mask index cases had a potential seven times risk of transmission and were observed among those wearing face masks , especially within 0 - 72 hours from onset of symptoms , reduced household transmissibility by 87 % and might be considered an adjunctive measure . A very high SAR of index cases who shared bedrooms , either shared bathrooms or not , a promptly separated bedroom and bathroom when COVID - 19 was diagnosed was essential to minimize transmissibility in addition to awaiting individuals ' immunity effects ( Eikenberry et al . , 2020 ; Pratt et al . , 2021 ) . If home isolation is impossible , providing isolated facilities might be necessary to control household transmission and reduce reproductive numbers in the household ( Li et al . , 2021 ) . 9 The limitations of this study cannot be used to stratify the effectiveness of each vaccine type . The lack of characteristics of SARS - CoV - 2 acquisition and infection control elements in contact cases should be cautiously interpreted . The study period was the recent implementation of inactivated and ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccines in Bangkok and did not include mRNA vaccines . The number of BBiBP - CorV - vaccinated cases was too small to be described . In a previous report , we could not evaluate the individual’s household contacts with comorbidities , which had a high SAR ( Madewell et al . , 2021 ) . Predominated households diagnosed using rapid antigen tests may have misled lower than the actual SAR . Our results confirmed that fully inactivated vaccines or ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccinated within 14 - 90 days demonstrated the most significant advantage in preventing household transmission . SAR was very high in CoronaVac vaccinated index cases within < 14 days and > 90 days , indicating that CoronaVac had the most effectiveness – 14 - 90 days after the second dose and needed an early booster dose before 90 days after the second dose . However , the effectiveness of inactivated and ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 vaccines was relatively low compared with recent reports , and mRNA vaccines or high efficacy vaccines should be implemented in high - SAR countries for the highest benefit to prevent within - household transmission . SARS - CoV - 2 vaccination and appropriate booster should be implemented nationwide , especially in unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals with waning immunity . The effect of preventing household transmissibility depends on the period of highest effectiveness of the vaccine and supports the concept of herd immunity ( Aschwanden , 2021 ) . The effect of a heterologous booster vaccination with high efficacy vaccines following the first and second doses of inactivated vaccinated index cases to decrease within - household transmissibility was very challenging to interrupt spreading . Vaccination in index cases could be a primary measure to prevent within - household transmission , which is a deserving controllable strategy independent of socioeconomic and emotional factors . Post - exposure prophylaxis with novel agents to prevent household transmission needs to be proven in a clinical trial and eradicate the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic .
