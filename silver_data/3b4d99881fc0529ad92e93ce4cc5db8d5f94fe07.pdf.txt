M307334200 Richard Lundmark and Sven R . Carlsson‡ From the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics , Umeå University , S - 901 87 Umeå , Sweden Sorting nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) belongs to a family of proteins , the sorting nexins , that are characterized by the pres - ence of a subclass of the phosphoinositide - binding phox domain . SNX9 has in its amino terminus a Src homology 3 domain and a region with predicted low complexity followed by a carboxyl - terminal part containing the phox domain . We previously found that SNX9 is one of the major proteins in hematopoietic cells that binds to the (cid:1) - and (cid:2) 2 - appendages of adaptor protein complex 2 ( AP - 2 ) , a protein with a critical role in the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles at the plasma membrane . In the present study we show that clathrin and dynamin - 2 , two other essential molecules in the endocytic process , also interact with SNX9 . We found that both AP - 2 and clath - rin bind to the low complexity region in SNX9 in a co - operative manner , whereas dynamin - 2 binds to the Src homology 3 domain . In the cytosol , SNX9 is present in a 14 . 5 S complex containing dynamin - 2 and an unidenti - fied 41 - kDa protein . In HeLa cells , SNX9 co - localized with both AP - 2 and dynamin - 2 at the plasma membrane or on vesicular structures derived from it but not with the early endosomal marker EEA1 or with AP - 1 . The results suggest that SNX9 may be recruited together with dynamin - 2 and become co - assembled with AP - 2 and clathrin at the plasma membrane . Overexpression in both K562 and HeLa cells of truncated forms of SNX9 interfered with the uptake of transferrin , consistent with a role of SNX9 in endocytosis . The family name sorting nexin ( SNX ) 1 is given to a large group of proteins that are represented throughout the eukary - otic kingdom . Sorting nexins are characterized by the presence of a subclass of the phosphoinositide - binding phox ( PX ) do - main , and it is believed that a common function of proteins in this family is to participate in sorting processes in the cell . Several members localize to endosomal structures , and some of the SNX proteins have been shown to directly interact with transmembrane receptors to regulate their sorting in the en - dosomal pathway ( for a review , see Ref . 1 ) . The localization of SNX proteins is suggested to be determined by their PX do - mains , although protein - protein interactions may also contrib - ute to the membrane specificity ( 2 , 3 ) . SNX9 and its close relative SNX18 are the only members of the sorting nexin family that contains an Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain . SH3 domains interact specifically with short proline - containing sequences ( P XX P ) and are present in a large num - ber of proteins ( 4 ) . Target sequences are often located in dis - tinct domains , referred to as proline - rich domains ( PRDs ) . SNX9 was originally identified as a molecule that interacted with PRDs in certain metalloprotease disintegrins ( ADAMs ) ( 5 ) . Work in Drosophila showed that SNX9 ( named DSH3PX1 ) interacted with Dock ( the fly orthologue of mammalian Nck ) and Dscam ( Down’s syndrome cell adhesion molecule ) to form a complex involved in axonal guidance in the fly ( 6 , 7 ) . In addi - tion , SNX9 was found to interact with the clathrin - binding tyrosine kinase Ack through an SH3 - PRD interaction . In mam - malian cells , Ack2 interacted with the receptor for epidermal growth factor , and this interaction was stabilized by SNX9 . Upon stimulation with epidermal growth factor , SNX9 became tyrosine - phosphorylated and was suggested to play a role to - gether with Ack2 in the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( 8 ) . In a previous report ( 9 ) , we identified SNX9 as one of the major proteins in the cytosol from human K562 cells that bound to the appendages of adaptor protein complex 2 ( AP - 2 ) . It was therefore suggested that SNX9 in some way is involved in the process of clathrin - coated vesicle formation at the plasma membrane . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is triggered by the assembly of AP - 2 and clathrin at specific sites at the plasma membrane , mediated by interactions with phosphoi - nositides in the membrane ( 10 – 12 ) . As the clathrin coat forms , the membrane invaginates and becomes a coated pit . Once activated in the coat , AP - 2 reaches out to collect transmem - brane cargo proteins by protein - protein interactions ( 13 ) . A variety of accessory factors participates in these events , many of them interacting with the appendage domains of AP - 2 ( 14 ) . At a certain stage , the large GTPase dynamin is recruited to the coated pit and forms a collar at its base ( 15 , 16 ) . The assembly of dynamin leads to fission of the clathrin - coated vesicle from the membrane , possibly by a force generated through the hydrolysis of GTP . Although it is known that dynamin plays an essential role in the later stages of endocy - tosis , the mechanism of action has not yet been revealed ( 17 , 18 ) . In addition , it has not been established how this important molecule is targeted to the membrane . In the present study , we identify dynamin - 2 ( Dyn2 ) as a major partner for SNX9 in the cytosol from hematopoietic cells and show that SNX9 assem - bles with Dyn2 and AP - 2 at the plasma membrane . The results suggest that SNX9 plays a role in the clathrin - dependent en - docytic machinery . * This work was supported by grants from Umeå University Biotech - nology Funds for Basic Science - oriented Research , the Faculty of Med - icine and Odontology at Umeå University , and the Kempe Foundation .

Antibodies were affinity - purified using the recombinant pro - tein or used as serum after removal of anti - GST antibodies . Purchased antibodies were : mouse anti - EEA1 clone 14 ( BD Transduction Labora - tories , Lexington , KY ) , mouse anti - (cid:1) 1 / (cid:1) 2 - adaptin clone 100 / 1 , mouse anti - FLAG ( Sigma ) , rabbit anti - dynamin - 2 ( Affinity Bioreagents , Golden , CO ) , mouse anti - dynamin Hudy 1 ( Upstate Biotechnology , Wal - tham , MA ) , fluorescein - linked donkey anti - rabbit immunoglobulins , and Cy3 - linked goat anti - mouse immunoglobulins ( Amersham Bio - sciences ) . All other antibodies were as described previously ( 9 ) . DNA Constructs— cDNAs encoding human full - length SNX9 , SH3 , LC , LC - 2 , LC - 3 , and LC - 4 were amplified by PCR using the appropriate primers and IMAGE clone 3832234 ( UK Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Centre ) as template . After digestion , the PCR products were ligated into the pGEX - 5X - 1 or pGEX - 6p - 2 vector ( Amersham Bio - sciences ) generating GST fusion constructs . Coding regions correspond - ing to SH3LC , PXCT , LC - 1 , and SH3LCPX were excised from full - length SNX9 or from the LC construct and subcloned into the pGEX - 5X - 1 or pGEX - 6p - 2 vector . GST - LC - 108S ( W108S substitution ) , GST - LC - 165S / 169S ( W165S , W169S substitutions ) , and GST - LC108S / 165S / 169S ( W108S , W165S , W169S substitutions ) were created by PCR - directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . GST - (cid:2) c and GST - (cid:1) 3 c were described before ( 9 ) . The construct encoding human dynamin - 2 PRD ( 19 ) was a kind gift from Dr . Peter Westermann . For expression in K562 cells , DNA encoding SNX9 and SH3LCPX was excised from IMAGE clone 3832234 and inserted into the expres - sion vector pMEP4 ( Invitrogen ) . To obtain amino - terminal FLAG - tagged proteins , oligonucleotides corresponding to a FLAG peptide ( DYKDDDDK ) were inserted into the pMEP4 vector . DNA encoding SNX9 , SH3LC , and PXCT were then subcloned into the modified vector . For expression in HeLa cells , FLAG - SNX9 and FLAG - SH3LC was excised from the pMEP4 - FLAG vector and inserted into the pFLAG - CMV - 4 vector ( Sigma ) . All constructs and mutations were confirmed by sequencing . All oligonucleotides were purchased from DNA Technolo - gies ( Aarhus , Denmark ) . Transfections— The conditions for transfection of K562 cells by elec - troporation were as described previously ( 20 ) . Induction of expression by 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 (cid:3) M Cd 2 (cid:1) resulted in a 10 – 15 - fold expression over endoge - nous SNX9 as estimated by immunoblotting . HeLa cells grown in Dul - becco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 2 m M glutamine , and antibiotics were transfected using the CaCl 2 method ( 21 ) . Immunofluorescence and Transferrin Uptake— HeLa cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline for 20 min on ice , washed , and permeabilized and blocked in 0 . 05 % saponin , 1 % bovine serum albumin in phosphate - buffered saline . Cells were stained with the appropriate primary and secondary anti - bodies following standard protocols and scanned with a laser scanning Leica DMIRBE confocal microscope equipped with an argon - krypton laser . Sets of fluorescent images were acquired sequentially for the red and green channels to prevent crossover of signals . To quantify the degree of co - localization , cells were divided into 100 - (cid:3) m 2 squares , and the total number of red , green , and yellow fluorescent dots was counted in each square . In total 14 squares and over 800 dots from several cells were counted for each quantification , and the percent co - localization was calculated . Holotransferrin ( Calbiochem ) was biotinylated by a 7 - fold molar excess of sulfo - N - hydroxysuccinimide - SS - biotin ( Pierce ) in 50 m M NaHCO 3 and desalted . For transferrin uptake experiments , transfected cells were harvested , starved in serum - free medium for 30 min at 37 °C , and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with serum - free medium supple - mented with 25 (cid:3) g / ml biotinylated transferrin . Cells were washed repeatedly in phosphate - buffered saline to remove surface - bound trans - ferrin before fixation . After washes , cells were opened and blocked as indicated above before incubation with primary and secondary antibod - ies and Cy3 - labeled streptavidin ( Amersham Biosciences ) . After re - peated washes , cells were mounted and viewed using a Carl Zeiss Axioplan microscope . Analysis of transferrin uptake by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay was performed essentially as described before ( 22 ) using glutathione for quenching of surface - bound transferrin . Protein Expression and Purification— GST fusion proteins were ex - pressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously ( 9 ) . Dynamin PRD was expressed and purified according to Ref . 19 . GST - (cid:2) c was cleaved overnight at 37 °C with Factor Xa ( Amersham Biosciences ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions followed by repeated ab - sorption with glutathione - Sepharose beads . For purification of clathrin triskelions , cytosol was incubated with glutathione - Sepharose to which GST - (cid:1) 3 c was previously cross - linked using dimethyl pimelimidate ( Sigma ) . After extensive washes of the beads in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in HKM buffer ( 100 m M potassium acetate , 20 m M HEPES - KOH , and 1 m M magnesium acetate , pH 7 . 4 ) bound material was eluted with 0 . 5 M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 . Before use in binding experiments , the buffer was changed to HKM buffer using MicroBio - Spin P6 columns ( Bio - Rad ) . Preparation and Use of Cytosol— K562 cells were harvested and washed twice in phosphate - buffered saline and twice in KSHM buffer ( HKM buffer with 85 m M sucrose ) , both supplemented with 0 . 5 m M sodium orthovanadate . Cells were resuspended with 1 – 2 volumes of KSHM buffer containing 1 m M sodium orthovanadate and a protease inhibitor mixture ( 9 ) , and the suspension was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen . After thawing , the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 850 (cid:2) g for 5 min . The morphology of the cells was not affected by this treatment indicating that internal structures were mainly intact . The majority of both SNX9 and Dyn2 was released into the supernatant . The supernatant was centrifuged at 70 , 000 (cid:2) g for 30 min , and the cytosol was aliquoted and stored at (cid:3) 80 °C . The protein concentration was 15 – 20 mg / ml . The cytosol was thawed and centrifuged for 10 min at 20 , 000 (cid:2) g before use . For immunoprecipitations , cytosol was added to protein A - Sepharose beads ( Amersham Biosciences ) to which antibodies were previously bound , and the samples were incubated by slow agitation for 1 – 3 h at 4 °C . Beads were washed three times in 0 . 5 % Nonidet P - 40 in 20 m M HEPES - KOH , pH 7 . 4 before analysis by SDS - PAGE combined with immunoblotting or Coomassie Blue staining . Pull - down assays with GST fusion proteins were performed as described before ( 9 ) . For pull - down assays with purified proteins , equal molar amounts of fusion proteins ( 3 (cid:3) M ) were used together with 8 (cid:3) M Dyn2 - PRD , 3 (cid:3) M AP - 2 (cid:2) - appendage , or 0 . 2 (cid:3) M clathrin heavy chain . For velocity sedimentation analysis , freshly prepared cytosol ( 250 (cid:3) l ) was loaded on top of a 4 - ml continuous sucrose gradient ( 10 – 30 % sucrose in 20 m M HEPES - KOH , 1 m M magnesium acetate , 1 m M sodium orthovanadate , pH 7 . 4 ) and centrifuged at 4 °C in a Beckman SW60 rotor at 200 , 000 (cid:2) g av for 16 h . In parallel , a mixture of bovine serum albumin , catalase , and ferritin as sedimentation markers was centri - fuged . Fractions ( 250 (cid:3) l ) were collected from the top . A pellet fraction was obtained by resuspension in 250 (cid:3) l of 20 m M HEPES - KOH , pH 7 . 4 . Membrane Analysis— A 70 , 000 (cid:2) g pellet fraction obtained from the cytosol preparation ( see above ) containing membranes and vesicles was resuspended in 1 % Nonidet P - 40 in KSHM buffer and incubated for 20 min on ice and centrifuged at 70 , 000 (cid:2) g for 30 min . The supernatant was collected and analyzed , and the pellet was divided in two aliquots that were either incubated in a low salt buffer ( 85 m M sucrose , 20 m M HEPES - KOH , and 1 m M magnesium acetate , pH 7 . 4 ) or in an equal mixture of 1 M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 and KSHM buffer . After incubation on ice for 20 min , the samples were centrifuged at 70 , 000 (cid:2) g for 30 min , and the supernatants were analyzed . The pellets contained less than 1 % of the total protein in the starting material and were found to be devoid of clathrin , AP - 2 , Dyn2 , and SNX9 . Membrane / vesicular material obtained after freezing / thawing of K562 cells as above were separated according to density by equilibrium centrifugation in a 12 - ml continuous 0 – 60 % Nycodenz gradient in KSHM buffer . After centrifugation in an SW41 rotor at 40 , 000 rpm for 16 h , fractions ( 1 ml ) were collected from the top and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting and for density by refractometry . A pellet fraction was obtained by resuspension in 1 ml of KSHM buffer . Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry— Coomassie Blue - stained bands from SDS - PAGE were excised , and proteins were di - gested with 1 (cid:3) g of trypsin ( sequencing grade modified trypsin , Pro - mega , Madison , WI ) and analyzed on a Voyager DE - STR MALDI - TOF mass spectrometer ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) essentially as described before ( 23 ) . Peptide coverage was (cid:4) 50 % for both dynamin - 2 and clathrin heavy chain . Liposome Experiments— Phospholipids were purchased from Ma - treya ( State College , PA ) or from Sigma . Liposomes ( 50 nmol of phos - pholipid / reaction ) were prepared in KSHM buffer essentially as de - scribed before ( 24 ) and incubated with GST fusion proteins in a total volume of 40 (cid:3) l of KSHM buffer containing 0 . 5 mg / ml bovine serum albumin . After incubation on ice for 15 min , the liposomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 20 , 000 (cid:2) g for 5 min . Liposomes were rinsed with 200 (cid:3) l of KSHM buffer , centrifuged , and finally prepared for SDS - PAGE . Role of Sorting Nexin 9 in Endocytosis 46773 by gu e s t on J u l y 9 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m RESULTS Identification of Proteins Interacting with SNX9— We previ - ously described that SNX9 contains binding sites for the ap - pendages of AP - 2 ( 9 ) . Since SNX9 consists of several domains with potential binding function , it was of interest to identify other interacting endocytic proteins to establish a role for SNX9 in this system and to map the interaction sites in SNX9 . Full - length SNX9 and truncation variants were produced as GST fusion proteins and used in binding experiments and for the production of polyclonal antibodies . Fig . 1 shows the con - structs and the nomenclature used in the present investigation . In a pull - down experiment from cytosol , several proteins were detected that specifically interacted with the GST fusion pro - teins ( Fig . 2 A ) . Two of the major binding proteins , migrating at 180 and 110 kDa , were identified by mass spectrometry as clathrin heavy chain and Dyn2 , respectively ( Fig . 2 A , bands denoted 1 and 2 ) . Both of these proteins were pulled down by the amino - terminal one - third of SNX9 ( GST - SH3LC ) . To identify more precisely the domains in SNX9 that bound clathrin , Dyn2 , and AP - 2 , pull - down experiments were per - formed with fusion proteins containing different parts of SNX9 together with both cytosol and purified proteins . Fig . 2 B shows that the SH3 domain in SNX9 binds directly to the PRD in Dyn2 . This result was expected since several other SH3 - con - taining proteins interact with dynamin through this region ( 16 ) . Both clathrin and AP - 2 (cid:2) - appendage bind to a disordered region ( designated LC ) located between the SH3 and PX do - mains . The binding of the (cid:2) - appendage was stronger to the SH3LC construct than to full - length SNX9 , and clathrin - bind - ing was only detectable with the SH3LC construct ( see also Fig . 2 A ) , suggesting that the binding sites for clathrin and AP - 2 is obstructed in full - length SNX9 . The low complexity sequence between the SH3 and PX domains that is located outside the LC region ( starting at amino acid 185 ) does not appear to possess any strong binding sites for clathrin and AP - 2 (cid:2) - chain since construct PXCT , which contained this extra sequence , was negative . Mapping of Binding Sites for AP - 2 and Clathrin in SNX9 Low Complexity Region— Investigation of the fine specificity of (cid:2) - appendage and clathrin binding to the LC region is shown in Fig . 2 , C and D . The appendages of AP - 2 are known to bind DPF and DPW sequences in various proteins ( 25 ) . Since SNX9 contains a DPW motif at amino acids 106 – 108 , we expected this sequence to be involved in the binding of AP - 2 . As can be seen in Fig . 2 C , some binding of purified (cid:2) - appendage to LC1 and LC2 containing the DPW sequence was found . However , a stronger binding was revealed when the fusion protein was extended to amino acid 183 ( LC ) . The extra region consists of 64 amino acids containing the acidic sequence DDDDWD - EDWD . This sequence has properties reminiscent of a recently F IG . 1 . Domain organization of SNX9 and description of recombinant constructs used in the present investigation . A , SNX9 contains an SH3 domain at the amino terminus followed by a region with predicted low complexity , a PX domain in the middle , and a large domain at the carboxyl terminus with predicted (cid:2) - helical structure ( CT ) . Recombinant proteins were expressed as GST or FLAG fusion proteins ( both tags located at the amino terminus ) or as untagged protein as indicated in the text and figures . B , amino acids of the part of the low complexity sequence designated LC in A . LC and sections thereof ( designated LC - 1 , LC - 2 , LC - 3 , and LC - 4 ) were expressed as GST fusion proteins . Tryptophan residues mutated to serines in certain constructs are highlighted ( constructs LC - S108 , LC - S165 / S169 , and LC - S108 / S165 / S169 ) .

Indeed LC3 , which contains the acidic sequence but not the DPW sequence , displayed approximately the same binding strength as LC1 and LC2 . That the two described motifs are of importance was shown by the markedly weakened binding for the (cid:2) - appendage in point mutants of LC where tryptophan F IG . 2 . Identification of proteins in - teracting with different domains of SNX9 and analysis of binding speci - ficity . GST fusions of proteins indicated at the top of each figure or GST alone was bound to glutathione - Sepharose beads and incubated with cytosol or purified proteins . After washing , bound proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and de - tected by Coomassie Blue staining or by immunoblotting using antibodies against Dyn2 , clathrin heavy chain , and AP - 2 (cid:2) - chain as indicated . A , binding of cytoso - lic proteins to different regions of SNX9 . Loaded beads were incubated with ( (cid:1) cy - tosol ) or without ( (cid:3) cytosol ) cytosol , and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue . Bands denoted 1 and 2 were identified by MALDI - TOF as clathrin heavy chain and Dyn2 , respectively . Bands below the fu - sion proteins are degradation products . B , binding of clathrin and Dyn2 from cytosol and purified recombinant domains ( PRD from Dyn2 and appendage domain of AP - 2 (cid:2) - chain , (cid:2) c domain ) to different re - gions of SNX9 . C , binding of purified ap - pendage domain of AP - 2 (cid:2) - chain to full - length SNX9 and different variants of the LC region of SNX9 . D , binding of clathrin triskelions purified from cytosol to full - length SNX9 and different variants of the LC region of SNX9 and to the carboxyl - terminal part of AP - 3 (cid:1) - chain ( (cid:1) 3 c ) as a control . A Coomassie Blue stain of puri - fied clathrin analyzed by SDS - PAGE is shown to the left ( CHC , clathrin heavy chain ; CLC , clathrin light chains ) .

Mutations in either motif displayed interme - diate binding ( LC - S108 and LC - S165 / S169 ) , indicating a coop - erative binding of the (cid:2) - appendage to the wild - type LC sequence . Surprisingly LC4 , which is a shorter version of the acidic sequence - containing region , did not show any binding of the (cid:2) - appendage . The region between the two motifs ( amino acids 120 – 151 ) may be of importance for the correct presenta - tion of the acidic motif in the fusion protein or may contain a weak third binding site . Purified clathrin triskelions were used to prove a direct interaction with the LC region in SNX9 and for investigation of the binding specificity ( Fig . 2 D ) . For the binding of clathrin , an even more pronounced cooperative effect was seen . Only the full - length sequence of LC showed significant binding , and all three tryptophan mutant variants abolished detectable inter - action . The nature of the motifs that is recognized by clathrin is not obvious since SNX9 does not contain a classical “clathrin box” motif as present e . g . in the (cid:1) - chain of AP - 3 ( (cid:1) 3 c in Fig . 2 D ) . However , many variants of clathrin binding sequences have been reported recently ( 27 ) . Both affected sites in SNX9 ( 107 PWSAW and 164 DWDEDW ) are slightly similar to one of the clathrin - binding sequences in amphiphysin ( PWDLW ) ( 28 ) , and low affinity interactions of the triskelion with these sites may result in significant cooperative binding . It appears , how - ever , that clathrin and AP - 2 use overlapping binding sites in SNX9 , which may have interesting implications for the ar - rangements in putative ternary complexes . Characterization of a SNX9 - Dyn2 Complex in Cytosol— The affinity of SNX9 for Dyn2 produces an association between the two proteins in a native complex in cytosol . This was shown by co - immunoprecipitations from cytosol with antibodies against both Dyn2 and SNX9 ( Fig . 3 A ) . As a control of specificity , Eps15 , which is another accessory protein involved in endocy - tosis ( 14 ) , was not detected in the SNX9 - Dyn2 complex . That substantial amounts of Dyn2 are in complex with SNX9 in cytosol was indicated by the fact that Dyn2 was seen as a major band after immunoprecipitation with anti - SNX9 and staining of the gel with Coomassie Blue ( Fig . 3 B ) . In addition , an uni - dentified protein at 41 kDa was specifically co - immunoprecipi - tated by anti - SNX9 . As judged from the staining intensity of the bands , it appears that the three components of the complex are present in a 1 : 1 : 1 molar ratio . Sedimentation velocity anal - ysis of cytosol ( Fig . 3 C ) showed that most of SNX9 and part of Dyn2 co - migrated with a sedimentation coefficient of 14 . 5 S . For a globular complex this sedimentation corresponds to a molecular mass of (cid:5) 400 kDa . Coomassie staining of sedimen - tation fractions after immunoprecipitation revealed that also the 41 - kDa protein co - migrated with SNX9 and Dyn2 ( data not shown ) . Taken together , the data are most consistent with the presence of a complex consisting of two molecules each of SNX9 ( 78 kDa ) , Dyn2 ( 100 kDa ) , and p41 . SNX9 Is Assembled on Membranes— In our previous study ( 9 ) we found by cell fractionation experiments that most of SNX9 was present in the cytosol fraction with very small amounts on the membranes . We have now found that the F IG . 3 . SNX9 is associated with Dyn2 in the cytosol . A and B , co - immunoprecipitation . A , cytosol was immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum ( preimmune ) and anti - SNX9 , anti - Dyn2 , and anti - Eps15 sera . Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE combined with immunoblotting using anti - Eps15 , anti - Dyn2 , and anti - SNX9 antibodies . B , cytosol was immunoprecipitated with preimmune and anti - SNX9 sera , and bound proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS - PAGE . The major bands specifically immunoprecipitated are indicated . C , sedimentation velocity centrifugation of cytosol . Fractions ( collected from the top ) were either analyzed directly ( total protein ) or after immuno - precipitation with anti - SNX9 ( bound and unbound ) by immunoblotting with anti - Dyn2 and anti - SNX9 . Sedimentation markers bovine serum albumin ( 66 kDa , 4 . 3 S ) , catalase ( 248 kDa , 11 . 3 S ) , and ferritin ( 467 kDa , 17 . 6 S ) were run in a parallel gradient .

If cell fractionation is performed at a physiological salt concentration , as done in the present study , at least half of SNX9 remains membrane - bound . Fig . 4 A shows an experiment where the material released from the cells after a quick freeze / thaw cycle was analyzed by sedi - mentation and extraction . All molecules detected , including SNX9 , were enriched in the membrane pellet fraction . Extrac - tion of the pellet with detergent solubilized a large part of the total proteins but not any of the analyzed proteins . This indi - cates that clathrin , AP - 2 ( which for technical reasons was detected with an antibody that in addition recognizes AP - 1 ) , Dyn2 , and SNX9 are assembled into larger , detergent - resistant complexes . However , all four molecules were efficiently ex - tracted either by lowering the salt concentration in the buffer or by using a high concentration of Tris . Density equilibrium centrifugation of membranes in Nyco - denz ( Fig . 4 B ) showed that clathrin and AP - 2 banded at a density of (cid:5) 1 . 17 g / ml , whereas Dyn2 was present on slightly lighter membranes ( peak at 1 . 13 g / ml ) . SNX9 gave a broader appearance in the gradient , covering the positions of both clathrin / AP - 2 and at least part of Dyn2 . It may be envisioned that SNX9 is distributed into different pools at the membrane , either co - localizing with Dyn2 , with AP - 2 , or with both . It is likely that the material analyzed contained both fragments from the plasma membrane ( and possibly also intracellular membranes ) together with various transport vesicles . The be - havior of clathrin and AP - 2 in both experiments shown in Fig . 4 is consistent with their presence on clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . Binding of SNX9 to Liposomes— To investigate whether SNX9 has lipid binding activity on its own , we analyzed the binding of recombinant full - length SNX9 and different parts of SNX9 to artificially prepared liposomes . When tested for bind - ing of GST - SNX9 to liposomes of different compositions , we found SNX9 to be promiscuous in its specificity ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . SNX9 bound to all phosphoinositides in the tested set , and no statistically significant difference in binding was found . It is clear , however , that SNX9 requires at least one exposed phos - phorous group for binding since phosphatidylinositol was negative . The most plausible region responsible for the interaction with membranes is the PX domain . When different parts of SNX9 were assayed for liposome binding , only PX domain - containing constructs were positive for binding ( Fig . 5 C ) . The experiment in Fig . 5 C also shows that co - sedimentation of positive fusion proteins is not due to liposome - induced aggre - gation and precipitation since GST - SNX9 and GST - PXCT floated together with the liposomes in high density medium by ultracentrifugation . So far , we have not been able to produce the PX domain alone in an active form . We can therefore not exclude the possibility that the CT domain influences the lipid binding or folding of the PX domain . Localization of SNX9 in HeLa Cells— Since SNX9 interacts both with membranes and with proteins that constitute the core of the endocytic machinery , it was of importance to inves - F IG . 4 . A large part of SNX9 in the cell is associated with membranes . K562 cells were opened by a freeze / thaw cycle , and released material was sepa - rated from the rest of the cells by a low speed centrifugation . A , the supernatant was centrifuged at 70 , 000 (cid:2) g for 30 min to obtain a cytosol fraction ( cytosol ) and a pellet ( 70 , 000 (cid:2) g pellet ) . The pellet was washed in extraction buffer containing 0 . 5 % Nonidet P - 40 and again centrifuged . The supernatant was saved ( NP40 wash ) , and the pellet was divided into two ali - quots that were washed in a low ionic strength buffer ( low salt wash ) and with 0 . 5 M Tris - HCl ( Tris wash ) , respectively , and the supernatants were analyzed after centrifugation . The distribution of the to - tal protein amount in the fractions are indicated , and 10 (cid:3) g of each fraction were analyzed by SDS - PAGE combined with immunoblotting with antibodies against clathrin heavy chain , (cid:1) - chains of AP - 1 and AP - 2 ( a - (cid:1) 1 / (cid:1) 2 ) , Dyn2 , and SNX9 . B , a 70 , 000 (cid:2) g pellet fraction prepared as in A was subjected to equilibrium centrifuga - tion in Nycodenz . Fractions were collected from the top and analyzed for clathrin , AP - 2 ( a - (cid:2) ) , Dyn2 , and SNX9 by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . The density ( dashed line ) and protein content ( solid line ) of the fractions are shown .

Immunofluorescence studies were preformed with HeLa cells that are more amenable to microscopic analysis than K562 cells ( Fig . 6 ) . By confocal microscopy , endogenous SNX9 displayed numerous small spots in a focal plane at , or close to , the surface of the cell adhering to the glass ( i . e . the plasma membrane , see Fig . 6 , second and fourth rows ) . In this plane , extensive co - localization was revealed with both AP - 2 and Dyn2 . Quantitation by dot counting showed that 72 (cid:6) 12 % ( S . D . ) and 73 (cid:6) 13 % ( S . D . ) of the SNX9 - positive dots co - local - ized with AP - 2 and Dyn2 , respectively . However , a smaller fraction of the AP - 2 - and Dyn2 - positive structures were posi - tive for SNX9 ( 35 (cid:6) 10 % ( S . D . ) and 37 (cid:6) 10 % ( S . D . ) , respec - tively ) , indicating the presence of different types of assemblies at the plasma membrane . At present , we cannot rule out the existence of SNX9 - positive structures that are negative for both AP - 2 and Dyn2 . SNX9 showed no sign of co - localization with AP - 1 at the trans - Golgi network , with EEA1 at early endosomes ( Fig . 6 ) , or with Lamp - 1 at lysosomes and late endosomes ( data not shown ) . Note that for the visualization of AP - 1 and EEA1 , the focal plane was adjusted for optimal de - tection of the respective antigen , and in these areas fewer SNX9 - positive spots were found . Inhibition of Endocytosis by Overexpression of Truncated SNX9— The ability of SNX9 to associate with several endocytic proteins ( AP - 2 , clathrin , and Dyn2 ) in vivo and in vitro argues strongly for a role of this protein in endocytosis . To test this in different cell types , we moderately overexpressed ( 10 – 15 - fold ) full - length and truncation variants of SNX9 in K562 cells ( Fig . 7 A ) and HeLa cells ( Fig . 7 B ) and assayed for the effect on uptake of transferrin . Whereas full - length SNX9 had no detect - able effect , truncations from the carboxyl terminus ( SH3LCPX and SH3LC ) abolished the uptake of transferrin . In contrast , expression of SNX9 with a truncation from the amino terminus ( PXCT ) resulted in no or very minor effect . The result from immunofluorescence analysis was confirmed by quantitation of transferrin uptake in K562 cells transfected with two of the constructs by a biochemical assay ( Fig . 7 C ) . Control cells showed a fast uptake of transferrin and reached a plateau after 4 min of incubation ( Fig . 7 C , left panel ) . The results for trans - fectants incubated for 2 min ( Fig . 7 C , right panel ) showed that the rate of endocytosis is affected similarly as found by immu - nofluorescence . In conclusion , expression of truncated variants containing the binding sites for AP - 2 , clathrin , and Dyn2 , but not full - length SNX9 containing the same sites , interfered with the endocytic process . Taken together , the results establish SNX9 as a molecule that participates in the clathrin - mediated endocytosis in cells . DISCUSSION The present study describes SNX9 as a molecule that in several respects differs from other sorting nexin family mem - bers . SNX9 appears to have its main role at the plasma mem - brane and not on endosomes , and it interacts with the core components of the endocytic machinery ( i . e . clathrin , AP - 2 , and Dyn2 ) and co - localizes with both AP - 2 and Dyn2 . In addition , its PX domain seems to comprise different lipid specificity than those of several other investigated SNXs , which , consistent with their role at the endosomal membrane , generally have a preference for phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( 1 , 29 ) . F IG . 5 . Binding of SNX9 to liposomes . A and B , liposome preparations contained 50 % phosphatidylcholine and either 50 % phosphatidyleth - anolamine ( denoted PE ) , 50 % phosphatidylinositol ( denoted PI ) , 50 % phosphatidylserine ( denoted PS ) , 40 % phosphatidylinositol (cid:1) 10 % phos - phatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( denoted PI ( 3 ) P ) , 40 % phosphatidylinositol (cid:1) 10 % phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 - diphosphate ( denoted PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ) , 40 % phosphatidylinositol (cid:1) 10 % phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - diphosphate ( denoted PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) , or 40 % phosphatidylinositol (cid:1) 10 % phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( denoted PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) . Liposomes were incubated for 15 min on ice with 1 (cid:3) g of GST - SNX9 . After centrifugation , the supernatants were saved ( S ) , and the pellets ( P ) were washed once before analysis by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining ( A ) . B , the amount of GST - SNX9 in each lane was measured by densitometry , and the percentage bound was calculated . The bars show the means from three separate experiments , and the S .

C , liposomes consisting of 50 % phosphatidylcholine , 40 % phosphatidylinositol , and 5 % each of phosphati - dylinositol 3 - phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - diphosphate were incubated with 250 ng of the indicated fusion proteins and centrifuged as in A . The supernatants were saved ( Supernatant ) , and after washing , the liposome pellets were adjusted to 40 % sucrose in HKM buffer and overlaid with equal volumes of 30 % sucrose in HKM buffer and KSHM buffer . After centrifugation at 100 , 000 (cid:2) g for 1 h , the upper interphase was saved ( Interphase ) , and the pellet was resuspended in the lower phase ( Pellet ) . Equal parts of each saved fraction were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting using anti - GST antibodies . BSA , bovine serum albumin .

Localization of SNX9 in HeLa cells by confocal microscopy . Cells grown on coverslips were fixed , permeabilized with saponin , and incubated with rabbit antibodies against SNX9 together with mouse antibodies against AP - 1 , AP - 2 , EEA1 , or Dyn2 , respectively .

It appears that Dyn2 is in excess over SNX9 in the cell since in sedimentation analysis a substantial fraction of Dyn2 migrated to the bottom of the tube as larger assemblies , whereas the majority of SNX9 co - migrated with Dyn2 in the gradient ( see Fig . 3 C ) . However , we have found that the complex is labile and rapidly dissociates if the cytosol is diluted in extraction buffer . Lowering of the salt concentration in cytosol stabilizes the complex to some extent F IG . 7 . Inhibition of transferrin up - take in cells by overexpression of truncated forms of SNX9 . A and B , K562 cells ( A ) and HeLa cells ( B ) were transfected with DNA encoding indicated proteins . After incubation with biotiny - lated transferrin for 15 min at 37 °C , the cells were processed for immunofluores - cence of SNX9 by anti - SNX9 or anti - FLAG followed by fluorescein isothiocya - nate - labeled secondary antibodies and of transferrin with Cy3 - labeled streptavi - din . The experimental conditions were ad - justed so that endogenous SNX9 was vi - sualized only weakly when anti - SNX9 antibodies were used . Note that K562 cells are suspension cells whose immuno - fluorescence is not well resolved in the microscope . The pictures shown are rep - resentatives of a large number of fields examined in the microscope . In all cells where SH3LC and SH3LCPX were signif - icantly overexpressed , the uptake of transferrin was abolished . The scale bar represents 10 (cid:3) m . C , transfected K562 cells were incubated with biotin - SS - trans - ferrin on ice for 15 min and then trans - ferred to 37 °C and incubated for various periods of time . After reduction of cell sur - face - bound transferrin with glutathione , the amount of internalized biotinylated transferrin was measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay . Percent up - take was calculated relative to the amount of transferrin bound to unre - duced cells left on ice . Left panel , time course for uptake by vector - transfected cells . Right panel , uptake in transfected cells after incubation at 37 °C for 2 min . The results are the means from three ex - periments , and the error bars indicate (cid:6) S . D .

The background up - take by cells transfected with construct SH3LC ( right bar in right panel ) corre - sponds to the proportion of non - overex - pressing cells in the population . Role of Sorting Nexin 9 in Endocytosis 46780 by gu e s t on J u l y 9 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m ( as done in the sedimentation and immunoprecipitation anal - yses ) , but the relative amounts of SNX9 and Dyn2 that are associated in the complex are difficult to determine for this reason . From different experiments , we estimate that at least 25 % of Dyn2 is associated with SNX9 . 2 Work is underway to identify the third component and to establish the role of the complex . It is likely that SNX9 recycles between a cytosolic and a membrane - bound pool , similar to clathrin , AP - 2 , and dynamin . From membrane analysis and co - localization experiments we conclude that , at steady state , a large fraction of SNX9 resides at the plasma membrane or on vesicles derived from it . Dyn2 may be recruited together with SNX9 to the plasma membrane through interactions between the PX domain and membrane lipids , and the two molecules could subsequently assemble with clathrin and AP - 2 . SNX9 may stay together with AP - 2 and clathrin after formation of the vesicle , whereas Dyn2 is re - leased ( 15 , 16 ) . In agreement with this view , a recent study showed a high enrichment of SNX9 in a purified preparation of clathrin - coated vesicles ( 30 ) . The finding that the binding of clathrin and the (cid:2) - appendage of AP - 2 to the low complexity region of SNX9 is impeded in the full - length molecule implies that the exposure of this region in SNX9 may be regulated . Accordingly SNX9 complexes in the cytosol contain no or very little AP - 2 or clathrin ( Fig . 3 B and data not shown ) . The interaction with these molecules may be regulated to occur only at sites of macromolecular assembly . Similarly the interaction of SNX9 with the membrane may be enhanced after activation of the molecule . Taken together , cytosolic SNX9 appears to mask several of its binding regions in the resting state . The precise role of SNX9 in the endocytic process cannot be defined at present and must await further studies . The effect of expressing truncated forms of SNX9 on the uptake of trans - ferrin may have several possible explanations . As SNX9 has affinity for Dyn2 , clathrin , and AP - 2 , all of which have critical roles in endocytosis , depletion of any of these molecules from the cytosol is anticipated to have a dramatic effect on the uptake of cargo . However , full - length SNX9 , which appears to have the same capacity to bind Dyn2 as the SH3 - containing truncated variants , does not inhibit endocytosis . This fact , to - gether with the observation that Dyn2 appears to be in excess over SNX9 , speaks against the depletion of Dyn2 . On the other hand , since full - length SNX9 has its binding sites for clathrin and AP - 2 masked , it is possible that variants expressed with those sites exposed may bind to both clathrin and AP - 2 in the cytosol . These possible associations , which normally should occur only at the membrane , could lead to malfunction or mislocalization of clathrin and AP - 2 . It is also possible that for SNX9 to be functional in endocytosis , it requires the (cid:2) - helix - rich carboxyl - terminal domain . Homology searches in data bases reveal that this domain is only found in SNX9 and SNX18 , and the function is so far completely unknown . The last 28 amino acids show a high probability for coiled - coil forma - tion , and it is possible that this part is essential for the assem - bly of a functional multimeric complex of SNX9 . Since SNX9 is present in a complex with Dyn2 in the cytosol , SNX9 may come into play at the later stages of vesicle forma - tion together with dynamin . It is intriguing that in addition dynamin is suggested to be involved in cellular processes not directly associated with its established role for severing nas - cent endocytic pits ( 31 ) . Increasing evidence suggests that dy - namin participates in the nucleation of actin filaments , both at the sites of endocytosis and elsewhere ( 32 , 33 ) . It is anticipated that dynamin , together with SH3 domain - containing proteins , is part of a regulatory machinery for formation of cross - linked actin meshworks by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Several SH3 - contain - ing proteins are suggested to link dynamin to distinct sites of actin nucleation , including Grb2 , syndapin , Abp1 , intersectin , and cortactin . SNX9 may be involved in this system since we show here that significant amounts of endogenous dynamin in the cytosol are indeed in a complex with SNX9 . Furthermore studies have shown that SNX9 through its SH3 domain can bind to Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) ( 6 ) , 2 which is a major regulator of actin polymerization via Arp2 / 3 . It is possible that SNX9 in addition is involved in cellular functions apart from , or in conjunction with , the endocytic process fo - cused upon in the present study .
