Kalnins Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology , University of Toronto , 1 King’s College Circle , Toronto , Ontario , M5S 1A8 , Canada Present address : 1 Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology , The University of Western Ontario , London , Ontario , N6A 5C1 , Canada Abstract An in vitro system has been established to study the migration of human melanoma cells through a monolayer of endothelial cells . Endothelial cells were cul - tured to confluence on Matrigel before the seeding of melanoma cells . Laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that , prior to migration , melanoma cells appeared round and showed cortical F - actin staining . The initial stage of transmigration was characterized by numerous membrane blebs protruding from basolateral surfaces of the melanoma cells , and contact regions showed an abun - dance of filaments arising in the underlying endothelial cells . Later , pseudopods from the melanoma cells inserted into contact regions between endothelial cells . Eventually , the melanoma cells intercalated with the endothelial cells . At this stage , many endothelial filament bundles terminat - ed at contacts between the endothelial cells and the trans - migrating melanoma cell , suggesting active interactions between the two cell types . Upon contact with the Matri - gel , melanoma cells began to spread beneath the endothe - lium , displaying a fibroblastic morphology with promi - nent stress fibers . To reestablish the monolayer , adjacent endothelial cells extended processes over the melanoma cell . Tumor necrosis factor (cid:97) did not affect the transmi - gration of melanoma cells from cell lines isolated from several stages of metastasis . However , tumor necrosis fac - tor did promote the transmigration of melanoma cells de - rived from a non - metastatic lesion . These results thus de - fine cell attachment and cell penetration of the monolayer as two distinct steps in transmigration and suggest that tu - mor necrosis factor may enhance the metastatic potential of tumor cells . Key words Endothelial cells · Metastasis · Actin filaments · Cell – cell interactions · Tumor necrosis factor · Confocal microscopy · Man Introduction Cancer metastasis is a complex process involving a vari - ety of interactions between tumor cells and host tissues ( Nicolson 1988 ; Stetler - Stevenson et al . 1993 ; Brodt 1996 ) . Metastasizing cells must first separate from the primary tumor and enter the circulatory system . Those cells surviving the hostile environment of the blood stream will eventually arrest in the capillary beds of spe - cific organs . Here tumor cells will adhere to the surface of the endothelium and extravasate by migrating between the endothelial cells . Successful extravasation is accom - panied by cell proliferation , invasion of the surrounding tissue , and development of metastases . The endothelium provides a natural barrier to metastasis . A better under - standing of the mechanisms involved in the transendothe - lial migration of cancer cells , therefore , is important to the development of effective cancer therapies . To date , most work on adhesive interactions in trans - endothelial migration has focused on leukocytes ( Albelda et al . 1994 ; Carlos and Harlan 1994 ; Picker 1994 ; Stewart et al . 1995 ; Dunon et al . 1996 ; Maschio et al . 1996 ; Voura et al . 1997 ) . Work on transendothelial migration of cancer cells has primarily involved the use of metastatic cell lines in in vivo models and the examination of in situ morphological characteristics ( Lauri et al . 1990 ; Albelda 376 et al . 1990 ; Kuzu et al . 1993 ; Renard et al . 1994 ; Garofalo et al . 1995 ) . There have been few studies describing the passage of tumor cells through an endothelium . We have , therefore , developed an in vitro system that allows de - tailed examination of tumor cell transmigration in a con - trolled environment . In our model system , melanoma cells are seeded on a confluent layer of endothelial cells , and their migration through the endothelium is monitored microscopically . Melanoma cells were chosen for this study , because mel - anoma is one of the best characterized human malignan - cies . It has been classified into five clinically identifiable stages ( Herlyn et al . 1990 ) with lesions ranging from those considered benign to those which are highly meta - static . Consequently , melanoma provides an excellent starting point for studies of tumor progression . The WM cell lines used in this study provide a wide range of well characterized and widely used human melanoma cells from different stages of metastatic progression ( Herlyn et al . 1985 , 1990 ; Rodeck et al . 1987 ; Kath et al . 1991 ; Lu et al . 1992 ; Kobayashi et al . 1994 ) . It is interesting that , in contrast to leukocytes and other tumor cells , mel - anoma cells simply adhere to ( they do not roll on ) an en - dothelium under conditions of flow in vitro ( Giavazzi et al . 1993 ; Albelda et al . 1994 ; Carlos and Harlan 1994 ; Picker 1994 ; Stewart et al . 1995 ; Goetz et al . 1996 ) . In this report , we have used laser scanning confocal microscopy to investigate the interactions between endo - thelial cells and transmigrating melanoma cells . It is known that cell – cell and cell – substratum adherens type junctions of endothelial cells are associated with a dy - namic network of cytoplasmic filaments and that these fi - laments are required for cell migration . We have therefore focused our studies on changes to the F - actin cytoskele - tons in both cell types as the melanoma cells adhere to and migrate through the endothelial cell monolayer . The results obtained depict dynamic changes in cell shape and actin cytoskeleton of both cell types and provide ev - idence for the active participation of endothelial cells in the transmigration of melanoma cells . The effects of tu - mor necrosis factor (cid:97) ( TNF (cid:97) ) on several melanoma cell lines were also investigated . TNF (cid:97) promoted the transen - dothelial migration of the non - metastatic cell line WM35 . This observation thus defines cell attachment to the monolayer and cell migration through the monolayer as two distinct steps and suggests that TNF (cid:97) can enhance the metastatic potential of tumor cells . Materials and methods Cells and culture conditions Human umbilical vein ( HUV ) endothelial cells and human lung mi - crovascular ( HMV ) endothelial cells were purchased from Clonetics ( San Diego , Calif . , USA ) . HUV endothelial cells were cultured in endothelial growth medium , which contained 500 ml endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with 2 ml bovine brain extract ( 3 mg / ml ) , 0 . 5 ml human epidermal growth factor ( 10 (cid:31)g / ml ) , 10 ml fetal bovine serum ( 2 % ) , 0 . 5 ml hydrocortisone ( 1 mg / ml ) , and 0 . 5 ml gentamycin sulfate ( 50 mg / ml ) and amphotericin B ( 50 mg / ml ) , all of which were purchased from Clonetics . HMV en - dothelial cells were cultured in EGM - MV medium ( Clonetics ) . Five milliliters of 1000 U / ml penicillin and 1000 U / ml streptomycin ( Gibco / BRL , Gaithersburg , Md . , USA ) were also added to 500 ml medium . The human melanoma cell lines WM9 , WM35 , WM239 , and WM115 were provided by Dr . Meenhard Herlyn of the Wistar Insti - tute ( Philadelphia , Pa . , USA ) . All melanoma cell lines were cultured in RPMI medium , supplemented with 2 U / ml penicillin , 2 U / ml streptomycin , and 10 % fetal bovine serum . All cells were main - tained at 37(cid:30)C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 / air . Transendothelial migration assay Round glass coverslips ( 12 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick ) were coated with a 1 : 8 dilution of Matrigel ( Becton / Dickinson , Bedford , Mass . , USA ) . Matrigel was diluted in ice - cold water , and 200 (cid:31)l was applied to cold coverslips in 24 - well plates . Exactly 100 (cid:31)l Matrigel was subsequently removed , and the remaining amount was air - dried overnight in a laminar flow hood at room temperature and then re - hydrated in Hanks’ buffered saline solution . Following Matrigel re - hydration , the coverslips were transferred to 35 - mm dishes . The Matrigel formed a thin layer which optimized endothelial cell at - tachment and subsequent examination by laser scanning confocal microscopy . Endothelial cells ( 1 . 5(cid:148)10 5 cells taken between passages 2 and 8 ) were added to the Matrigel - coated coverslips in a 200 - (cid:31)l drop of endothelial growth medium and allowed to settle for 3 h . Unless noted otherwise , transmigration assays were routinely done with HUV endothelial cells . Coverslips were then transferred care - fully to 24 - well plates and incubated in 0 . 5 ml endothelial growth medium with 10 ng / ml TNF (cid:97) ( Gibco / BRL ) . Phase microscopy showed that confluent monolayers were obtained after 12 h of cul - ture , and they rarely showed any gaps under these conditions . Mel - anoma cells were then added to the monolayers . Melanoma cells were removed from culture dishes using 4 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate ( EDTA ) in Hanks’ buffered saline solu - tion and subsequently labeled with 1 , 1 ' - dioctadecyl - 3 , 3 ' , 3 ' - tetra - methylindocarbocyanine perchlorate ( DiI ; Molecular Probes , Eu - gene , Ore . , USA ) . The 2 . 5 mg / ml DiI stock solution was diluted 1 : 200 with Hanks’ buffered saline solution and added to the cells for 10 min at 37(cid:30)C . The DiI - labeled cells were washed three times in 2 ml Hanks’ buffered saline solution , and the final pellet was re - suspended in endothelial growth medium at a concentration of 1 . 76(cid:148)10 6 cells / ml . DiI - labeled melanoma cells ( 8 . 8(cid:148)10 4 cells in 50 (cid:31)l ) were then added to the monolayers and incubated for different time intervals prior to fixation and staining . TNF (cid:97) was included in co - cultures whenever TNF (cid:97) - stimulated monolayers were used . Un - less noted otherwise , WM239 cells were used in transmigration as - says . Fixation , extraction , and staining Cells were fixed using 3 . 5 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde at 22(cid:30)C for 5 min and washed three times ( 3 min each ) in phosphate - buffered saline , pH 7 . 4 . Cells were then extracted for 5 min in a cytoskele - ton - stabilizing buffer , pH 6 . 9 , containing 0 . 1 M 1 , 4 - piperazine - bis ( ethanesulfonic acid ) ( Aldrich , Milwaukee , Wis . , USA ) , 1 mM ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid ( EGTA ) , 4 % ( w / v ) polyethylene gly - col 8000 , and 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 ( Opas and Kalnins 1985 ) . The ex - traction was followed by another series of washes and a 5 - min blocking step in 1 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin . Cells were then labeled with 1 : 10 dipyrrometheneboron difluoride - conjugated phal - lacidin ( Molecular Probes ) in blocking solution for 45 min at 22(cid:30)C . Coverslips were then washed three times ( 3 min each ) with phos - phate - buffered saline and mounted . Strips cut from plastic coverslips ( stacked two high ) were used as spacers to avoid squashing the cells when mounted on microscope slides . The mounting medium was composed of 80 % glycerol in phosphate - buffered saline and con - tained 2 . 5 % ( w / v ) of the antioxidant 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo - [ 2 , 2 , 2 ] - octane 377 ( Sigma , St . Louis , Mo . , USA ) as an antibleaching agent . On occa - sion , 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) p - phenylenediamine ( Sigma ) was added to the mounting medium as an additional antioxidant . Preparations were sealed with nail enamel and stored in the dark at 4(cid:30)C . Fluorescence microscopy Confocal microscopy was carried out as described previously ( San - dig et al . 1996 , 1997a ) . X - Y images were obtained using either a Ni - kon Optiphot microscope , equipped with a (cid:148)60 objective lens and a Bio - Rad MRC 600 confocal imaging system , or a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope , equipped with a (cid:148)63 Neofluor objective lens and an LSM 410 confocal attachment . Serial optical sections were routinely taken at 1 - (cid:31)m thicknesses in an apical - to - basal direc - tion . Quantitative analysis of the melanoma cell transmigration was carried out using a Wild Leitz Orthoplan microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics . Quantification of transmigration by melanoma cells All experiments were done in triplicate unless indicated otherwise . Three sets of 15 random fields were scored for each coverslip . Each set of 15 fields contained 100 melanoma cells . Triplicate experi - ments resulted in over 1000 cells being scored for any one time point . All cell counts were carried out on F - actin - stained prepara - tions with the melanoma cells preloaded with DiI for identification . Melanoma cells were divided into three major categories and scored ( Fig . 1 ) . The relative distribution of melanoma cells in these catego - ries was also confirmed by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 10 ) . For com - parison , PC12 cells were also seeded on monolayers . PC12 cells re - mained fairly spherical throughout the assay , and only those that were clearly showing signs of spreading were scored as transmigrat - ed cells . Results In vitro model system for transendothelial migration An in vitro system was established to investigate the mi - gration of tumor cells through endothelia . A confluent en - dothelial cell monolayer cultured on a Matrigel - coated coverslip was used as the model endothelium ( Fig . 1 ) . The Matrigel was set to provide sufficient thickness to al - low penetration of transmigrating cells but thin enough for detailed microscopic examination . The cultures were fixed at different time intervals after seeding and stained for F - actin . In general , images of melanoma cells in con - tact with an endothelium could be divided into three broad categories ( Fig . 1 ) . Category 1 consisted of spheri - cal melanoma cells with “smooth” surfaces attached to the top of the monolayer . Category 2 included cells at var - ious stages of passage through the monolayer . These cells were characterized by prominent surface protrusions , and some became partially intercalated with endothelial cells . In category 3 were melanoma cells with a fibroblast - like shape . These melanoma cells were either enveloped by endothelial cells or located beneath the monolayer . They were in direct contact with and were spreading upon the Matrigel . To determine the kinetics of transendothelial migra - tion , WM239 cells were seeded on a monolayer of HUV endothelial cells . It took (cid:24) 30 min for melanoma Fig . 1 Schematic depiction of transendothelial migration as - say . For quantitative analysis , melanoma cells were divided into three major categories : ( 1 ) initial attachment of melanoma cell to endothelial cell mono - layer , ( 2 ) intercalation of mela - noma cell with endothelial cells , and ( 3 ) spreading of melanoma cell on Matrigel beneath the monolayer 378 cells to settle on the monolayer and become attached to the endothelial cells . Co - cultures were therefore fixed at 0 . 5 , 1 , 3 , and 5 h , and melanoma cells belonging to each of three categories were scored ( Fig . 2a ) . Melanoma cells appeared to initiate the transmigration process soon after attachment to the monolayer , since the number of spher - ical attached cells constituted < 20 % of the melanoma cell population after 30 min of co - culture . On the other hand , (cid:24) 80 % of cells already showed signs of transmigration . However , < 1 % of melanoma cells were spreading on the Matrigel . By 1 h , (cid:24) 15 % of attached melanoma cells were spreading on the Matrigel . The number of spreading cells increased steadily during the next 4 h . This increase was accompanied by a corresponding drop in the percent - age of transmigrating cells . Five hours later , (cid:24) 60 % of melanoma cells were spreading on the Matrigel . Approx - imately 90 % of melanoma cells completed migration through the endothelium after overnight culture . Cells in category 1 attached rather loosely to the monolayer . Ap - proximately 50 % of category 1 cells could be removed by agitation and washing ( data not shown ) , indicating that they were loosely attached to the monolayer . In contrast , the number of cells in categories 2 and 3 was not signif - icantly affected by the same treatment , probably due to their firm attachment to the endothelial cells and / or the Matrigel . The rapid penetration of melanoma cells during the 1st h of seeding raised the question whether gaps were present in the monolayer . Incomplete closure of the monolayer would allow melanoma cells to fall through and adhere directly to the Matrigel . As a negative control , we seeded the non - metastatic pheochromocytoma PC12 cells on the endothelial cell monolayer . Less than 5 % of PC12 cells showed signs of spreading on the Matrigel af - ter 5 h of co - culture ( Fig . 2a ) , indicating that junctional complexes had been formed between endothelial cells and that there were few gaps in the monolayer . It is known that melanoma cells have a tendency to form metastases in the lung . Therefore , transmigration of WM239 cells was also examined using HMV endothe - Fig . 2a , b Kinetics of transen - dothelial migration by melano - ma cells . DiI - labeled melanoma cells were seeded on tumor ne - crosis factor - (cid:97) - stimulated endo - thelial cell monolayers , and the cultures were examined at dif - ferent time intervals after seed - ing . The melanoma cells were separated into the three catego - ries : attached cells ( category 1 , open bars ) , intercalating cells ( category 2 , hatched bars ) , and transmigrated cells ( category 3 , solid bars ) . a WM239 cells cultured on a monolayer of hu - man umbilical vein endothelial cells . b WM239 cells cultured on a monolayer of human mi - crovascular endothelial cells . The total number of cells counted in each data set was taken to be 100 % , and the rela - tive percentages of cells in the three categories were calculated . As a negative control , DiI - la - beled PC12 cells ( PC12 ) were co - cultured on top of human umbilical vein endothelial cells . All values for melanoma cells represent the mean of three ex - periments , while those for PC12 cells were based on two experi - ments 379 lial cells as the model monolayer . Similar results were ob - tained for monolayers reconstituted with HMV endotheli - al cells ( Fig . 2b ) . However , there was an initial delay of (cid:24) 30 min , and only 2 % of melanoma cells were in catego - ry 3 at 1 h , compared to 18 % of cells seeded onto HUV endothelial cells . The number of WM239 cells in category 3 increased linearly between 1 and 5 h , and the rate of mi - gration through the HMV endothelial cell monolayer was similar to that obtained with the HUV endothelial cell monolayer ( Fig . 2a ) . By 5 h , (cid:24) 48 % of WM239 cells were spreading on the Matrigel . Morphology of endothelial cells and melanoma cells on Matrigel Confocal microscopy was used to study the process of melanoma cell migration through the endothelium at higher resolution ( Fig . 10 ) . First , we examined changes in the cytoskeletons of endothelial cells and melanoma cells cultured separately on Matrigel . Endothelial cells in a confluent monolayer , examined 12 h after seeding , displayed an abundance of peripheral actin filaments ( Fig . 3a ) . Stress fibers were often observed in regions where several endothelial cells met . WM239 cells , on the other hand , appeared spherical and expressed cortical F - actin when examined shortly after plating . There was a higher concentration of F - actin along the periphery of the spreading front ( Fig . 3b ) . Spreading melanoma cells could be seen as early as 1 h after plating . Eventually , the mel - anoma cells flattened and acquired a highly irregular shape with numerous stress fibers , suggesting relatively stable interactions between the cells and the Matrigel , and a high concentration of F - actin was apparent near the tips of many processes ( Fig . 3c ) .

Bars 10 (cid:31)m 380 Appearance of large membrane blebs in heterotypic cell – cell contacts of attached melanoma cells We next examined co - cultures of WM239 cells on HUV endothelial cell monolayers . Prior to transmigration , mel - anoma cells invariably had a spherical shape and relative - ly few membrane protrusions . Cortical F - actin staining was present , but the cells lacked stress fibers ( Fig . 4a ) . Frequently , the melanoma cells were located directly on top of contact regions between endothelial cells , where a high local concentration of F - actin was evident and fil - ament bundles from the underlying endothelial cells were seen to terminate ( Fig . 4b ) . Interestingly , these melanoma cells rarely spread on top of the monolayer , and most cells remaining on top of the monolayer were spherical even after 5 h of co - culture . Most melanoma cells attached to endothelium began to send out lateral pseudopods from basal areas within a short time , while the upper part of the cell still retained a rounded shape ( Fig . 5a ) . Cortical F - actin staining was evident along the periphery of melanoma cells . Large membrane blebs appeared on the pseudopods ( Fig . 5b ) and on the basal cell surface ( Fig . 5c ) . Although occasion - al small blebs were found along the cell surface in other regions , clusters of blebs with a diameter > 1 (cid:31)m were on - ly found along the heterotypic contact sites in the basal regions of the melanoma cells . Often prominent mem - brane blebs extended in several directions from the basal surface of the melanoma cell ( Fig . 5d ) . A high concentra - tion of F - actin was present between adjacent blebs . Inter - estingly , filament bundles from the underlying endothelial cells frequently appeared to terminate near the melanoma cell membrane blebs ( Fig . 5c ) or regions between them where a high concentration of F - actin is present ( Fig . 5d ) , suggesting active interactions between the two cell types in this region . Occasionally , lamellipodial structures filled with F - actin were also found extending from a melanoma cell that appeared to make contact with endothelial cell surfaces ( Fig . 5e ) . Changes in cell shape and cytoskeleton during transendothelial migration During transendothelial migration , melanoma cells under - went drastic shape changes . As a result , cells differing widely in shape were observed . The images could , how - ever , be arranged in a plausible sequence that reflected Fig . 5a – e Confocal images of membrane protrusions along the basolateral surfaces of melano - ma cells attached to an endo - thelial cell monolayer .

Melanoma cells penetrating the monolayer showed corti - cal F - actin staining , similar to that seen at earlier stages , but were flatter and often had a spindle - shaped morphol - ogy . Figure 6a shows a melanoma cell with the lower half of its body surrounded by endothelial cells . Figure 6b il - lustrates a pseudopod , potentially arising from blebs on the basal cell surface , penetrating downward through an endothelial cell junction . At a more advanced stage of transmigration , endothelial cells retracted further , allow - ing more complete intercalation of melanoma cells ( Fig . 6c , d ) . Interestingly , melanoma cells and endothelial cells were always in close apposition , and gaps were not detected between the two cell types , suggestive of active heterotypic adhesive interactions . Transmigrating mela - noma cells continued to exhibit cortical F - actin staining and retained a spindle - shaped morphology . Active spreading of endothelial cells over melanoma cells during reclosure of the monolayer Lamellipodia with prominent stress fibers , arising from adjacent endothelial cells , were often seen on top of the intercalated melanoma cells ( Fig . 6c ) . These processes contained prominent filament bundles that extended up - wards over the apical surface of the melanoma cell and terminated at contact sites on the melanoma cell , suggest - ing that endothelial cell processes were actively spreading on top of the melanoma cell . Behavior of endothelial cells during closure of a gap is similar to that of endothelial cells during closure of small wounds ( Ettenson and Got - lieb 1993 ) . Indeed , transendothelial migration was only completed when the gap in the monolayer was closed by the spread - ing of endothelial cell processes . At this stage , the fila - ment bundles in these cell processes stretched completely over the apical surface of the underlying melanoma cell ( Fig . 7a , b ) . Upon contact with the Matrigel , melanoma cells began to spread under the endothelium ( Fig . 7c ) .

Cortical F - ac - tin was evident along the periphery of the melanoma cell in regions above the Matrigel ( Fig . 7c , e ) . However , close to the Matrigel , prominent arrays of stress fibers were seen in the spreading melanoma cell ( Fig . 7f ) . Effects of TNF (cid:97) on transendothelial migration of melanoma cells To determine whether melanoma cells from various stag - es in tumor progression differed in their ability to undergo transendothelial migration , several cell lines were exam - ined . The WM9 cell line , like the WM239 cell line de - scribed above , was established from a metastatic human lesion , while the WM115 and WM35 cell lines were iso - lated from a late vertical growth phase lesion and a pre - metastatic lesion , respectively ( Herlyn et al . 1985 , 1990 ; Rodeck et al . 1987 ) . The rates of cell transmigration in these lines were compared using our in vitro assay . TNF (cid:97) is known to stimulate the expression of cell ad - hesion molecules in endothelial cells ( Luscinskas et al . 1995 ) and promotes the transmigration of leukocytes ( Muller et al . 1993 ) . The ability of melanoma cells from these lines to migrate through TNF (cid:97) - stimulated and un - stimulated endothelial cell monolayers was investigated . When the means obtained with and without TNF (cid:97) stimu - lation of endothelial cells for WM9 , WM115 , and WM239 cells were compared , these cell lines showed similar percentages of transmigrated cells , and none of the differences was found to be statistically significant ( Fig . 8a ) . In contrast , WM35 melanoma cells failed to transmigrate efficiently in the absence of TNF (cid:97) ( Fig . 8b ) . Instead of migrating through the monolayer , many cells began to spread on top of it . Since it was difficult to determine the different stages of transmigration accurately using the epifluorescence mi - croscope for this cell line , the co - cultures with WM35 cells were examined and quantified by confocal microsco - py . The results obtained showed that (cid:24) 80 % of WM35 cells remained on top of the endothelial cell monolayer 5 h after seeding ( Fig . 8b ) . About 50 % of WM35 cells dis - played a spherical morphology ( Fig . 9a , d ) that belonged to category 1 . In contrast , < 5 % of WM239 cells were scored in category 1 by 5 h ( see Fig . 2a ) . Among the re - maining WM35 cells , many spherical cells had long fi - lopodial structures extending from their basolateral sur - faces into the monolayer ( Fig . 9b , e ) , while others flat - tened and spread on top of the endothelial cells ( Fig . 9c , f ) . Both types of morphology were novel , and they were not observed previously with WM239 cells ( Fig . 9g – l ) . When seeded on top of monolayers in the presence of TNF (cid:97) , WM35 cells transmigrated and spread on the Matrigel with an efficiency comparable to that of the other three melanoma cell lines ( Fig . 8 ) . By 5 h , < 10 % of WM35 cells remained on top of the monolayer , and most cells were either intercalated with endothelial cells or spreading on the Matrigel , with morphologies comparable to those observed with WM239 cells ( Fig . 9g – l ) . To determine whether TNF (cid:97) exerted a direct effect on WM35 cells , cells were preincubated with TNF (cid:97) for 30 min before seeding on a monolayer that had not been stimulated by TNF (cid:97) . The percentage of these TNF (cid:97) - treat - ed WM35 cells which completed transendothelial migra - tion was indistinguishable from that of TNF (cid:97) - treated co - cultures ( Fig . 8b ) . The result suggests that TNF (cid:97) had a di - rect influence on the ability of WM35 cells to migrate through the monolayer . Discussion We have established an in vitro model system which en - ables the detailed examination of molecular and cellular interactions during the process of transendothelial migra - tion by melanoma cells . Sequential events of migration can be divided into five stages , and they are summarized schematically in Fig . 10 . In many ways , the transendothe - lial migration of melanoma cells resembles that of leuko - cytes ( Pawlowski et al . 1988 ; Muller 1995 ) . However , there are also major differences . First , the time taken for melanoma cells to complete transendothelial migra - Fig . 8a , b Effects of tumor necrosis factor (cid:97) treatment on the trans - endothelial migration by melanoma cells . The migration assay was carried out by seeding cells from different melanoma cell lines on top of either tumor necrosis factor (cid:97) ( TNF (cid:97) ) - stimulated ( solid bars ) or unstimulated ( open bars ) endothelial cell monolayers . Cells were scored at 5 h . a Percentage of cells in category 3 was scored for WM9 ( WM9 ) , WM239 ( WM239 ) , and WM115 ( WM115 ) cell lines . PC12 cells ( PC12 ) , which do not transmigrate , were included as a negative control . b WM35 cells ( WM35 ) were scored by confocal microscopy . In a separate experiment , WM35 cells were pretreated with TNF (cid:97) for 30 min , washed three times , and then seeded on a monolayer that was not previously stimulated by tumor necrosis fac - tor ( hatched bar ) . Data presented as mean(cid:127)SD 384 Fig . 9a – l Maximum projections of optical section series of melano - ma cells at different stages of transendothelial migration . Each pro - jection was rotated to provide top and side views , and the relation - ship between the melanoma cell and its surrounding endothelial cells was analyzed . Two images from each rotation series were chosen to represent the appearance of these stages from the top ( a – c , g – i ) and from the side ( d – f , j – l ) . Red coloration indicates the DiI label in the melanoma cell while green coloration reveals the F - actin staining in both endothelial cells and melanoma cells . Shades of yellow and or - ange represent colocalization of red and green colors . a – f Images of WM35 cells cultured on a monolayer in the absence of tumor necro - sis factor (cid:97) . a , d Top and side views of a spherical WM35 cell ad - hering to the monolayer . b , e Spherical WM35 cell with long filopo - dium - like structures ( arrowheads ) extending from its basolateral surface into the monolayer . c , f WM35 cell spreading on the mono - layer . g – l WM239 cells cultured on a human microvascular endothe - lial cell monolayer . g , j Top and side views of a spherical WM239 cell on endothelial cells . h , k Spindle - shaped WM239 cell with an endothelial cell process spreading over part of its cell body ( arrow - heads ) . i , l WM239 cell ( asterisks ) spreading on the Matrigel be - neath the monolayer . (cid:148)1200 . Bar 10 (cid:31)m 385 tion is much longer . Studies using leukocytes indicate that virtually all cells can fully migrate through an endotheli - um within a couple of hours ( Muller et al . 1993 ; Liao et al . 1995 ) . When our assay system was applied to the study of leukocytes , (cid:24) 50 % of monocytes completed migration through the monolayer within 1 h ( Sandig et al . 1997b ) . In contrast , only 15 % of WM239 cells showed signs of spreading on the Matrigel at 1 h . Previous in vitro studies using different tumor cell lines and endothelial cell mono - layers also report similar extravasation times ( Kramer and Nicolson 1979 ; Nicolson 1982 ; Ohigashi et al . 1989 ) . A recent report examining melanoma cell transendothelial migration in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane indi - cates that 50 % of injected melanoma cells leave the blood vessels within 2 h ( Koop et al . 1995 ) , suggesting that the time for transmigration of melanoma cells in situ is sim - ilar to what we observed in our culture system . Another major difference is that leukocytes and mono - cytes migrate between endothelial cells with minimal dis - ruption of the monolayer . This is quite unlike melanoma cells , which cause considerable retraction of surrounding endothelial cells to accommodate the larger melanoma cell size . Leukocytes are capable of squeezing through much narrower openings between endothelial cells ( Paw - lowski et al . 1988 ; Sandig et al . 1997b ) , possibly because the cell body and nucleus of a leukocyte are much more flexible . The contact region between endothelial cells consti - tutes a permeability barrier to different solutes and con - trols the passage of cells through the endothelium . Recent studies from several laboratories have led to a better un - derstanding of endothelial cell contact regions . Several types of cell – cell junctions are known to exist between endothelial cells . While tight ( occluding ) junctions and gap ( communicating ) junctions are not found in all endo - thelia , adherens junctions appear to be ubiquitous ( Dejana et al . 1995 ) . The endothelial adherens junctions contain a specific type of cadherin ( vascular endothelial cadherin ) which is expressed only by endothelial cells ( Lampugnani et al . 1992 ; Ayalon et al . 1994 ) . Another component con - centrated primarily in the contact region between endo - thelial cells is the platelet endothelial cell adhesion mole - cule PECAM - 1 , a member of the immunoglobulin super - family of cell adhesion molecules ( Albelda et al . 1990 , 1991 ; Newman et al . 1990 ; Simmons et al . 1990 ; New - man 1997 ) . A recent report shows that adhesion of polymorphonu - clear leukocytes to endothelium induces the disappear - ance of vascular endothelial cadherin from all endothelial cell – cell contacts ( Maschio et al . 1996 ) . This effect can be inhibited by anti - (cid:98) 2 integrin antibodies , suggesting that it may be induced by contact - mediated signaling involving two integrins . PECAM , on the other hand , is retained be - neath the adherent polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the region of endothelial cell – cell contacts . Recent studies , nevertheless , have indicated that PECAM plays an impor - tant role in transendothelial migration of leukocytes and monocytes ( Albelda et al . 1994 ; Muller 1995 ) . Antibodies and peptides that block the adhesive function of PECAM inhibit the transmigration of leukocytes , even though roll - ing and attachment of these cells to the endothelial cell monolayer are normal ( Muller et al . 1993 ; Bogen et al . 1994 ; Liao et al . 1995 ) . These observations have led to the suggestion that homophilic interactions between PE - CAM expressed on endothelial cells and leukocytes are critical to the transmigration process . Attachment of melanoma cells results in the dissolu - tion of both vascular endothelial cadherin and PECAM complexes in the region of endothelial cell contacts ( San - dig et al . 1997c ; E . B . Voura and C . - H . Siu , unpublished observations ) . In contrast to disappearance of only vascu - lar endothelial cadherin during transendothelial migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes , the disappearance of vascular endothelial cadherin and PECAM during mela - noma cell transmigration is a highly localized event , Fig . 10a , b Schematic drawings depicting different stages of trans - endothelial migration by melanoma cells . There are five morpholog - ical stages ( I , II , III , IV , V ) of cell transmigration ( a ) . These stages are accompanied by distinct cell shape changes in the melanoma cells as viewed from the top ( b ) . F - actin distribution in endothelial cells at the heterotypic contact sites and in melanoma cells is indi - cated by lines inside the cells . Owing to the low resolution of con - ventional fluorescence microscopy , melanoma cells in stages II and III were scored collectively as category 2 cells , and those in stages IV and V were scored collectively as category 3 cells in our kinetic studies ( cf . Fig . 1 ) 386 and it occurs only in regions directly beneath the attached melanoma cells . Other regions of endothelial cell contact in the vicinity are not affected . Therefore , neither vascular endothelial cadherin nor PECAM may be required for en - dothelial cell - to - melanoma cell adhesion during transen - dothelial migration . Studies from several laboratories suggest that melano - ma cells adhere to endothelial cells via an Arg - Gly - Asp - dependent mechanism , in which the vascular cell adhe - sion molecule on endothelial cells and the very late anti - gen 4 on melanoma cells may participate ( Lauri et al . 1990 ; Giavazzi et al . 1993 ; Offner et al . 1993 ; Lafrenie et al . 1994 ; Garofalo et al . 1995 ) . Resting endothelial cells express a basal level of vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 . TNF (cid:97) induces not only an elevated level of vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 , but also its redistribution to regions between endothelial cells ( Carlos and Harlan 1994 ; Cart - wright et al . 1995 ; Iademarco et al . 1995 ; Luscinskas et al . 1995 ; Bradley and Pober 1996 ) . In addition , TNF (cid:97) has been shown to induce the production of various cytokines , which in turn can stimulate the transendothelial migration of leukocytes ( Muller et al . 1993 ) . Interestingly , our re - sults show that TNF (cid:97) does not seem to have any major effects on the transmigration of melanoma cells from cell lines established from a metastatic melanoma . Since it has been reported that tumor progression can lead to a loss of sensitivity to many paracrine growth factors ( Lu et al . 1992 ; Rak et al . 1994 ) , melanoma cells from these cell lines are likely no longer responsive to the effects of TNF (cid:97) . Significantly , most non - metastatic WM35 cells re - mained attached to the unstimulated monolayer in our as - say system , but successfully migrated through the endo - thelial cell monolayer only in the presence of TNF (cid:97) . This observation , therefore , defines cell attachment and cell penetration as two distinct steps in the transendothelial migration process and suggests that TNF (cid:97) may enhance the metastatic potential of otherwise non - metastatic mel - anoma cells . Since TNF (cid:97) has been shown to induce the expression of E - selectin , vascular cell adhesion mole - cule - 1 , and intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 in human fetal astrocytes ( Hurwitz et al . 1992 ) , it may likewise trig - ger the WM35 cells to express an elevated level of cell adhesion molecules , enabling them to mimic the invasive behavior that is characteristic of melanoma cell lines de - rived from later stages of metastatic progression . We have found that only a short preincubation of WM35 cells with TNF (cid:97) is sufficient to enhance the ability of these cells to undergo transendothelial migration up to the level of the metastatic lines . In light of these findings , it will be of in - terest to determine the molecular events triggered by TNF (cid:97) in WM35 cells . Our in vitro model system should provide a useful paradigm for more detailed investigation of molecular and cellular events during transendothelial migration of tumor cells .
