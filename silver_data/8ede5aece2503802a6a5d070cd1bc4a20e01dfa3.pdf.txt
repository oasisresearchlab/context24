Genes involved in angiogenesis and circulatory system development are differentially expressed in porcine epithelial oviductal cells during long - term primary in vitro culture – a transcriptomic study Abstract An oviduct is an essential organ for gamete transport , oocyte maturation , fertilization , spermatozoon capa - citation and early embryo development . The epithelium plays an important role in oviduct functioning . The products of secretory cells provide an optimal environment and influence gamete activities and embryonic development . The oviduct physiology changes during the female cycle , thus , the ratio of the secreted mole - cules in the oviduct fluid differs between phases . In this study , a differential gene expression in porcine ovi - duct epithelial cells was examined during the long - term primary in vitro culture . The microarray expres - sion analysis revealed 2552 genes , 1537 of which were upregulated and 995 were downregulated after 7 days of culture , with subsequent changes in expression during 30 day - long culture . The obtained genes were classified into 8 GO BP terms , connected with angiogenesis and circulatory system development , extracted by DAVID software . Among all genes , 10 most up - regulated and 10 most down - regulated genes were selected for further investigation . Interactions between genes were indicated by STRING software and REACTOME FIViz application to the Cytoscape 3 . 6 . 0 software . Most of the genes belonged to more than one ontology group . Although studied genes are mostly responsible for angiogenesis and circulatory sys - tem development , they can also be found to be expressed in processes connected with fertilization and ear - ly embryo development . The latter function is focused on more , considering the fact that these genes were expressed in epithelial cells of the fallopian tube which is largely responsible for reproductive processes .

Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 164 Introduction The oviduct is an important organ of the female reproductive system . While the uterus plays a sig - nificant role in implantation , the oviduct is a place of gamete transport , oocyte maturation , fertiliza - tion , spermatozoon capacitation and early embryo development [ 1 , 2 ] . In most mammals , the oviduct consists of three different segments , the infundibu - lum , ampulla , and isthmus , each of which is involved in specific biological events . The mammalian oviduct is lined by a simple co - lumnar epithelium [ 3 ] . Epithelial cells are formed in the early stage of embryo development and are gen - erated from ectoderm and endoderm . The function of epithelial cells is to transport essential nutrients , oxygen , fluids , and ions . They also secrete several components and produce certain signals . These signals might be generated spontaneously or due to other factors [ 4 ] . The epithelium of the oviduct plays an important role in the functioning of this structure . It provides a proper environment for the embryonic development at its early stage [ 5 ] . It is composed of two different porcine oviduct epithe - lial cell ( POEC ) types , ciliated cells and non - ciliated secretory cells . These two types of cells can be eas - ily differentiated in pigs , based on the differences observed in the cytoplasmic concentration of the cells , the secretory granules found on the apical sur - face of the cells , and the presence or lack of cilia [ 1 ] . Secretory cells synthesize and secrete specific pro - teins , glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) that influence the activities of gametes and embry - os at the cleavage - stage . The synthesized secretory material is stored in the epithelial cells to later be released into the lumen of the fallopian tube [ 1 , 6 ] . Oviduct fluid is an essential part of oviductal envi - ronment . It consists of serum filtrate , follicular fluid and specific secretory compounds that are synthe - sized and secreted by the epithelial secretory cells [ 7 ] . A composition of the oviductal fluid changes during the female cycle , due to hormonal changes in the oviduct [ 8 , 9 ] . The oviductal physiology alters in a cyclical manner , modulated by steroid hormones [ 10 ] . At the follicular phase of the estrous cycle , por - cine oviductal epithelium contains increased num - ber of long ciliated cells , and the secretory function of epithelial cells is higher due to estrogen and LH stimulation . However , during the luteal phase , nu - merous spherical - shaped , non - ciliated cells with short microvilli are present on the apical surface [ 7 , 11 ] . These alterations are necessary to provide an optimal conditions for gamete functioning , fertil - ization and early embryonic development [ 12 ] . Pig serves as a favored model organism due to its close anatomical and physiological similarities to human . Porcine female reproductive biology , in - cluding the hormonal regulation during the estrus cycle and early events of reproduction , resembles characteristics of human female reproductive sys - tem . The possibility to apply the results in human physiology , and easy availability , make pigs one of the most interesting animal models [ 13 ] . It is important to note that some specific features and functions of the oviductal epithelium may be lost during in vitro culture . This study investigated differential gene expres - sion in the porcine oviductal epithelial cells during 30 days of culture . The obtained genes were classi - fied into 8 different ontology groups connected with angiogenesis and circulatory system development . However , most of them also exhibit other functions in different organs or are strictly connected with early embryonic development . Materials and Methods Animals In this study , crossbred gilts ( n = 45 ) at the age of about nine months , which displayed two regular es - trous cycles , were collected from a commercial herd . All the animals were checked daily for estrus behav - ior and were slaughtered after reaching the anestrus phase of the estrus cycle . The uteri were then trans - ported to the laboratory within 30 min at 38°C . Oviductal epithelial cells ( OECs ) selection and culture Oviducts were washed twice in Dulbecco’s phos - phate buffered saline ( PBS ) ( 137 mM NaCl , 27 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) . Epithe - lial cells were removed using sterile surgical blades . Then , the epithelium was incubated with collagenase I ( Sigma Aldrich , Madison , USA ) , 1mg / mL in Dulbec - co’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ; Sigma Aldrich , Madison , USA ) for 1 h at 37 o C . The cell suspension obtained from this digestion was filtered through 40 µm pore size strainer to remove blood and single cells . The residue was collected by rinsing the strain - er with DMEM . The cell suspension was centrifuged ( 200 x g , 10 min . ) . Next , the cells were washed in PBS and centrifuged again . Later , they were incubated with 0 . 5 % Trypsin / EDTA ( Sigma Aldrich , Madison , USA ) at 37 o C for 10 min . The reaction was stopped with fetal calf serum ( FCS ; Sigma Aldrich , Madison , USA ) . After incubation , cells where filtered and cen - trifuged again . The final cell pellet was suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS , 100U / mL peni - cillin , 100 µg / mL streptomycin and 1µg / mL ampho - tericin B . The cells were cultured at 37 o C in a humid - ified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . Once the OEC cultures attained 70 – 80 % confluency , they were passaged by washing with PBS , digested with 0 . 025 % Trypsin / EDTA , neutralized by a 0 . 0125 % trypsin inhibitor ( Cascade Biologics , Portland , USA ) , centrifuged , and resuspended at a seeding density of 2x10 4 cells / cm 2 . The culture medium was changed every three days . The culture lasted 30 days . Gliszczyńska et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 165 RNA extraction from oviductal epithelial cells ( OECs ) Oviductal epithelial cell were pooled and har - vested at 24h , 7 days , 15 days and 30 days after the beginning of culture . Total RNA was extracted from samples using TRI Reagent ( Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) and RNeasy MinElute cleanup Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . The amount of total mRNA was determined from the optical density at 260 nm , and the RNA purity was estimated using the 260 / 280 nm absorption ratio ( higher than 1 . 8 ) ( NanoDrop spec - trophotometer , Thermo Scientific , ALAB , Poland ) . The RNA integrity and quality were checked on a Bioanalyzer 2100 ( Agilent Technologies , Inc . , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . The resulting RNA integrity numbers ( RINs ) were between 8 . 5 and 10 with an average of 9 . 2 ( Agilent Technologies , Inc . , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . The RNA in each sample was diluted to a concen - tration of 100 ng / μl with an OD260 / OD280 ratio of 1 . 8 / 2 . 0 . From each RNA sample , 100 ng of RNA was taken for microarray expression assays . Microarray expression analysis and statistics Total RNA ( 100 ng ) from each pooled sample was subjected to two rounds of sense cDNA amplification ( Ambion® WT Expression Kit ) . The obtained cDNA was used for biotin labeling and fragmentation by Affymetrix GeneChip ® WT Terminal Labeling and Hy - bridization ( Affymetrix ) . Biotin - labeled fragments of cDNA ( 5 . 5 μg ) were hybridized to the Affymetrix® Porcine Gene 1 . 1 ST Array Strip ( 48°C / 20 h ) . Microar - rays were then washed and stained according to the technical protocol using the Affymetrix GeneAtlas Fluidics Station . The array strips were scanned em - ploying Imaging Station of the GeneAtlas System . Pre - liminary analysis of the scanned chips was performed using Affymetrix GeneAtlas TM Operating Software . The quality of gene expression data was confirmed ac - cording to the quality control criteria provided by the software . The obtained CEL files were imported into downstream data analysis software . All of the presented analyses and graphs were performed using Bioconductor and R programming languages . Each CEL file was merged with a descrip - tion file . In order to correct background , normalize , and summarize results , we used the Robust Multi - array Averaging ( RMA ) algorithm . To determine the statistical significance of the analyzed genes , mod - erated t - statistics from the empirical Bayes method were performed . The obtained p - value was correct - ed for multiple comparisons using Benjamini and Hochberg’s false discovery rate . The selection of significantly altered genes was based on a p - value beneath 0 . 05 and expression higher than two fold . Differentially expressed genes were subjected to selection by examination of genes involved in angiogenesis and circulatory system development . The differentially expressed gene list was upload - ed to the DAVID software ( Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery ) [ 14 ] . Subse - quently the relation between the genes belonging to chosen GO terms with GOplot package was analyzed [ 15 ] . The GoPlot package had calculated the z - score : the number of up - regulated genes minus the number of down - regulated genes divided by the square root of the count . This information allowed for estimating the change course of each gene - ontology term . Moreover , interactions between differentially ex - pressed genes / proteins belonging to the chosen GO terms were investigated by the STRING10 software ( Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes ) [ 16 ] . The list of gene names was used as a query for an interaction prediction . The search criteria were based on co - occurrences of genes / proteins in sci - entific texts ( text mining ) , co - expression , and ex - perimentally observed interactions . The results of such analyses generated a gene / protein interaction network , where the intensity of the edges reflected the strength of the interaction score . Finally the functional interactions between genes that belongs to the chosen GO BP terms were inves - tigated by REACTOME FIViz application to the Cy - toscape 3 . 6 . 0 software . The ReactomeFIViz app is designed to find pathways and network patterns related to cancer and other types of diseases . This app accesses the pathways stored in the Reactome database , allowing to do pathway enrichment anal - ysis for a set of genes , visualize hit pathways using manually laid - out pathway diagrams directly in Cytoscape , and investigate functional relationships among genes in hit pathways . The app can also access the Reactome Functional Interaction ( FI ) network , a highly reliable , manually curated path - way - based protein functional interaction network covering over 60 % of human proteins . Ethical approval The research related to animal use has been com - plied with all the relevant national regulations and instructional policies for the care and use of animals . Bioethical Committee approval no . 83 / 2012 / DNT . Results To investigate oocyte transcriptome changes following 7 , 15 and 30 days after start of primary porcine oviductal epithelial cells , whole gene ex - pression analysis by Affymetrix® Porcine Gene 1 . 1 ST Array was performed . In such assay , expression of more than 14789 porcine transcripts was exam - ined . The genes for which the fold change was high - er than the cut - off value ( fold > | 2 | ) and corrected p value < 0 . 05 , were considered as differentially ex - pressed . From that group that consists of 2552 dif - ferent genes , 1537 were up - regulated and 995 were down - regulated after 7 days of culture , 1471 were up - regulated and 1061 were down - regulated after Gliszczyńska et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 166 15 days of culture and 1329 were up - regulated and 1203 were down - regulated after 30 days of culture . Among these , genes belonging to “angiogenesis” , “blood circulation” , “blood vessel development” , “blood vessel morphogenesis” , “circulatory system development” , “regulation of heart contraction” , “regulation of heart rate” and “vasculature devel - opment” Gene Ontology Biological Process ( GO BP ) terms were extracted by the DAVID ( Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery ) software . Up - and down - regulated genes included in selected GO BP terms were presented , together with their fold changes and adj . p values , in table 1 . All eight sets of genes were subjected to hierarchi - cal clusterization procedure and presented as heat - maps ( Fig . 1 ) . To investigate the direction of changes between each selected GO BP term , its z - score ( the ratio of up - and down - regulated genes in each GO BP terms ) was calculated . The z - scores with the rep - resentation of up - and down - regulated genes were shown in series of circle diagrams ( Fig . 2 ) . For further analysis 10 most up - and 10 most down - regulated genes were chosen from 91 genes that built chosen GO BP terms . In Gene Ontology database , genes that formed one particular GO group can also belong to other different GO term categories . For this reason , we explore the gene intersections between selected GO BP terms . The relation between those GO BP terms was presented as circle plot ( Fig . 3 ) as well as heatmap ( Fig . 4 ) . STRING software was used to generate interac - tion network among differentially expressed genes belonging to each of selected GO BP terms . This prediction method provided us a molecular interac - tion network formed between protein products of studied genes ( Fig . 5 ) . Finally we investigated the functional interactions between chosen genes with REACTOME FIViz app to Cytoscape 3 . 6 . 0 software . The results were shown in figure 6 . Discussion Genes isolated from the oviductal epithelial cells were classified into 8 different ontology groups : “angiogenesis” , “blood vessels development” , “blood vessels morphogenesis” , “circulatory system devel - opment” , “blood circulation” , “vasculature develop - ment” , “regulation of heart rate” and “regulation of heart contraction” . These groups include genes that are generally responsible for development and regulation of cardiovascular system . From 2552 genes , we chose 10 most up - regulated and 10 most down - regulated genes which represent groups mentioned above , as well as other groups , connect - ed with different organs and early embryo devel - opment . We investigated the expression of these genes for 30 days , checking the differences after 7 , 15 and 30 days . All genes constantly changed their expression . The most up - regulated gene was THY - 1 ( T - cell surface antigen ) which is expressed not only on immune cells , but also non - immune cells , such as endothelial cells , mesenchymal stem cells , some fi - broblasts and neurons [ 17 ] . It is e . g . responsible for development of myelin sheath , surrounding axons Gene Symbol foldD7 _ D1 foldD15 _ D1 foldD30 _ D1 adj . P . Val . D1 _ D7 adj . P . Val . D1 _ D15 adj . P . Val .

Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 169 of neurons of the nervous system . Its significant role in nervous tissue development may be of relevance to disorders such as ataxia - telangiectasia that com - bines neurologic and immunologic defects [ 18 ] . In earlier research performed on rats , THY - 1 was iden - tified on the endothelium of newly formed blood vessels . However it was expressed only during adult angiogenesis , not in embryos [ 19 ] . It appears that most of up - regulated genes from ovi - ductal epithelium are closely related with early embry - onic development . PPARD ( peroxisome proliferator - ac - tivated receptor delta ) has been found in the “embryo implantation” , “multicellular organism development” and “placenta development” ontology groups . In the latter it is responsible for decidualization , the process in which the cellular and vascular changes occur in the endometrium of uterus just after the implantation of blastocyst . Besides , PPARD is a major regulator of lipid metabolism and can be activated by either fatty acids or their metabolic derivatives [ 20 ] . FIGURE 4 Heatmap showing the gene occurrence between 10 most up and down regulated genes that belongs to studied GO BP terms . the coloring of the tiles represents each gene depends on the presence or absence of gene in listed GO BP term . The intensity of the color grows with the number of GO BP terms in which given gene co - occur FIGURE 5 STRING - generated interaction network among 10 most up and down regulated genes that belongs to studied GO BP terms . The intensity of the edges reflects the strength of interaction score Gliszczyńska et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 170 The next gene is ITGAV ( integrin , alpha - v ) , which also belongs to “embryo implantation” ontology group . Integrins are key receptors for several cel - lular processes including cytoskeletal organization , cell proliferation and differentiation . Alpha - V inte - grins participate in many developmental process - es and can be therapeutic targets for inhibition of angiogenesis and osteoporosis [ 21 ] . Other study indicated that mice lacking ITGAV gene in endothe - lial and hematopoietic cells died from vascular and developmental defects [ 22 ] . Another gene found in “embryonic placenta devel - opment” ontology group is EPAS1 ( endothelial PAS domain protein - 1 ) . In adult humans it is usually ex - pressed in highly vascularized tissues and in mice it is expressed in both adult and embryonic endothelial cells . It has been observed that EPAS1 may play a role of a vascularization regulator , including regulation of gene expression in the endothelial cells in response to hypoxia [ 23 ] . Since placenta is an organ highly involved in oxygen exchange , the relatively high ex - pression of EPAS1 may be connected with response to hypoxia [ 24 ] . Additionally EPAS1 is included in „blood vessel remodeling” ontology group . HHEX ( haematopoietically expressed homeobox ) encodes a homeobox transcription factor , which may be involved in hematopoietic differentiation and , as many members of this family , in develop - mental processes . It hasn’t been found in placenta , however , according to NEXTPROT database , this gene is responsible for “in utero embryonic devel - opment” in mice , the process of the embryo pro - gression in the uterus , from zygote formation in the oviduct to the time of birth . Foley and Mercola [ 25 ] observed the HHEX’s significance in fetal cardiac de - velopment . Paz et al . [ 26 ] indicates that knockout of this gene in mice results in embryonic lethality . Earlier mentioned ITGAV interacts and is co - ex - pressed with FN1 ( Fibronectin - 1 ) ( Fig . 5 ) . Its expres - sion is increased in oviductal epithelial cells around ovulatory period [ 27 ] , due to its role in regulation of oviduct cell - sperm interaction , fertilized oocyte ac - tivation and embryo development . Fibronectin do - mains interact with integrins and bind to oviductal cells and extracellular molecules , which is essential in cell adhesion , migration , proliferation and differ - entiation processes . Both fibronectin and integrins participate e . g . in oocyte uptake by oviduct fimbri - ae [ 28 ] and embryo development [ 29 ] . Besides , it has been found in the research on zebrafish that fibronectin is required for early cardiomyocyte for - mation in heart development [ 30 ] . ITGB3 ( Integrin beta - 3 ) is another integrin strongly interacting with fibronectin . It is involved in implantation processes , promotes intracellular adhesion and influences the uterine - conceptus in - FIGURE 6 Functional interaction ( FI ) between differentially expressed genes belonging to the selected GO BP terms . In following figure “ - > ” stands for activating / catalyzing , “ - | ” for inhibition , “ - ” for FIs extracted from complexes or inputs , and “ - - - ” for predicted FIs . The 10 most up and down regulated genes were marked yellow . The missing genes do not appear in reactome database Gliszczyńska et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 171 teractions as the receptor of ECM proteins [ 31 ] . It has been found in the endometrium and the embryo during implantation events in several species in - cluding human [ 31 , 32 ] . Both integrin subunits – aV and b3 have been observed to be expressed in early embryo implantation in pigs [ 33 ] . The importance of integrins in implantation was proved by Illera et al . [ 34 ] in studies on mice , where blocking of aVb3 in - tegrin expression inhibited embryo implantation . In turn , the alterations in integrin expression in endo - metrium caused infertility in humans [ 35 ] . Moreover , ITGB3 is responsible for maintaining capillary integ - rity and plays an essential role in regulating vascular permeability [ 36 ] . NOX4 ( NADPH oxidase 4 ) , is an up - regulated gene which was classified to only one of 8 ontology groups in our research – “circulatory system development” . Its major function is catalyzing ROS formation . It is expressed in kidney tubular cells at high levels and at lower levels in cardiomyocytes , endothelial cells and other cell types [ 37 ] , what explains relatively low expression of this gene in our study . It has been shown that reactive oxygen species are significant in mediation of angiogenesis . NOX4 producing H 2 O 2 in endothelial cells directly leads to angiogenesis [ 38 ] . Additionally it is classified to “cardiac muscle cell differentiation” and “heart process” ontology groups which are strictly connected with circulato - ry system development . COL1A2 ( collagen type I alpha 2 chain ) is a gene responsible mostly for skeletal system development . Collagen type I is predominantly produced by mes - enchymal cells in a tightly controlled manner . Its structure and biosynthesis are crucial for growth , morphogenesis and tissue repair [ 39 ] . Mutation in COL1A2 gene causes osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) , a disorder of connective tissue , where bones are fragile and susceptible to fracture [ 40 ] . Knisely et al . [ 41 ] observed that COL1A2 gene mutation in an infant contributed to death at 22 days of age , due to complications of osteogenesis imperfecta . COL1A2 interacts with integrins which act as receptors bind - ing collagen . Although our research doesn’t indicate it , according to literature COL1A2 also interacts with another up - regulated gene – LOX ( lysyl oxidase ) . LOX mediates collagen fiber organization in the ECM which is important in osteoblastogenesis regulation [ 42 ] . The aberrations in collagen type I cross - linking have been observed in bone disorders including os - teopetrosis or osteoporosis [ 43 , 44 ] . LOX modulates cross - linking of collagen monomers , forming insolu - ble fibers in the ECM , thus , it plays a significant role in maintaining the connective tissue integrity [ 42 ] . Among 10 genes down - regulated in in vitro condi - tions , CELA1 ( chymotrypsin like elastase family mem - ber 1 ) was the most down - regulated . CELA1 is known to be expressed in porcine pancreas but in human pancreas it remains functionally silent [ 45 ] . Accord - ing to Liu et al . [ 46 ] research , CELA1 was observed to regulate tubule formation in an in vitro angiogen - esis assay . This may suggest that it is responsible for forming tubular structures such as blood vessels in in vivo conditions as well . ANPEP ( alanyl aminopeptidase ) is a potent angio - genic regulator . Petrovic et al . [ 47 ] showed that this gene was required for endothelial cell membrane integrity and protein organization . Rangel et al . [ 48 ] observed that ANPEP knockout mice undergo physi - ologic angiogenesis . However under pathologic con - ditions , their angiogenic response is seriously im - paired . ANPEP is considered to interact with THY - 1 ( Fig . 5 ) . CXCL10 ( C - X - C motif chemokine 10 ) , like most chemokines , plays a significant role in development and homeostasis . It influences central nervous sys - tem and endothelial cells which are involved e . g . in angiogenesis . It has been showed that CXCL10 is a strong inhibitor of angiogenesis in vivo . Potentially , it participates in angiogenesis regulation during in - flammation and tumorigenesis [ 49 ] . Among the chosen down - regulated genes , 5 were classified to only one ontology group . SNAI2 , ARMC4 , ERBB3 and KDM6B were found in “circulatory system development” group , and HBB was found in “blood circulation” group . HBB ( Hemoglobin subunit beta ) , along with HBA ( alpha globin ) , determines a struc - ture of adult hemoglobin and is included in “blood circulation” ontology group , due to important role of hemoglobin in supplying tissues with oxygen . Mu - tations in this gene may lead to diseases including erythrocytosis , beta - thalassemia and sickle cell ane - mia . Interestingly , some HBB mutations display also beneficial features such as resistance to malaria [ 50 ] . SNAI2 ( snail family transcriptional repressor 2 ) plays a crucial role in developmental processes and is es - pecially responsible for epithelium development and epithelial - mesenchymal transitions [ 51 ] . In embry - onic life , it is one of the genes which control differen - tiation and migration processes of neural crest cells . It has been noted that in humans it exhibits antiapop - totic activity in both developing embryo and adults , preventing productive cell death [ 52 ] . ERBB3 ( erb - b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 ) plays important role in nervous system development and muscle tissue de - velopment . It has been observed that most embryos with ERBB3 knockout die before birth due to lack of Schwann cells that normally co - occur with peripheral axons of neurons [ 53 ] . Makinodan et al . [ 54 ] showed on mice that social isolation immediately after wean - ing caused reduced expression of ERBB3 leading to irreversible alterations in myelination and function of prefrontal cortex . KDM6B ( lysine - specific demethy - lase 6B ) was observed to have increased expression in murine embryonic stem cells during endothelial cell differentiation [ 55 ] . Agger et al . [ 56 ] found that mutation or inhibition of this gene leads to abnormal gonad development . Thus , its proper functioning is important for normal embryo development . KDM6B Gliszczyńska et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 172 was also found to play a key role in posterior devel - opment through HOX gene expression regulation [ 57 ] . KDM6B and KLF4 ( Kruppel - like factor 4 ) are pre - dicted to interact with each other ( Fig . 6 ) . It is pos - sible due to the potential role of KLF4 in embryon - ic stem cells . However , while KDM6B has increased expression during ES cells differentiation , the KLF4 is highly up - regulated in undifferentiated ES cells , and during differentiation its expression dramatical - ly decreases [ 58 ] . Thus , KLF4 plays a key role in ES cell maintenance and prevents their differentiation . KLF4 was classified e . g . to “negative regulation of an - giogenesis” group which is related with prevented differentiation of ES cells into endothelial cells . KLF4 was observed to strongly inhibit the endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation . It also suppresses the potential of endothelial cells to form capillary - like structures . KLF4 indirectly causes anti - proliferative and anti - angiogenic effects in ECs and VSMCs . Zheng et al . [ 59 ] suggests that enhanc - ing KLF4 expression might be a potential strategy in treatment of pathological vascularization and prolif - erative vascular disorders . RGS2 ( Regulator of g protein signaling 2 ) is addi - tionally classified into “relaxation of cardiac mus - cle” and “relaxation of vascular smooth muscle” on - tology groups . Tang et al . [ 60 ] observed that RGS2 knockout mice exhibit serious hypertension and en - hanced contractions of blood vessels . Heximer et al . [ 61 ] concluded that alterations in the RGS2 function or expression may be a cause of hypertension devel - opment in humans . Thus , it appears that RGS2 is nec - essary for proper functioning of vascular system and normal blood pressure and , due to its function , may be considered as a new hypertension drug develop - ment target [ 60 ] . Our current results showed differential expression of genes during long - term culture , confirming that in vitro conditions are significantly different from those in vivo . The microarray analysis showed that genes expressed in the oviductal epithelial cells can display other functions that are not strictly connected with oviduct function . However , circulatory system deve - lopment and angiogenesis are closely related with early embryo development and other events occur - ring in oviductal lumen .
