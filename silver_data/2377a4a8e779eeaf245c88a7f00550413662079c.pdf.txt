Ploidy is typically a 28 stable cellular feature that is critical for survival . Polyploidization is a route recognized to 29 increase gene dosage , improve fitness under stressful conditions and promote 30 evolutionary diversity . However , the mechanism of regulation and maintenance of ploidy 31 is not well characterized . Here , we examine the spontaneous diploidization associated 32 with mutations in components of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae centrosome , known as 33 the spindle pole body ( SPB ) . Although SPB mutants are associated with defects in 34 spindle formation , we show that two copies of the mutant in a haploid yeast favors 35 diploidization in some cases , leading us to speculate that the increased gene dosage in 36 diploids ‘rescues’ SPB duplication defects , allowing cells to successfully propagate with 37 a stable diploid karyotype . This copy number - based rescue is linked to SPB scaling : 38 certain SPB subcomplexes do not scale or only minimally scale with ploidy . We 39 hypothesize that acquisition of lesions in structures with incompatible allometries such 40 as the centrosome may drive changes such as whole genome duplication , which have 41 shaped the evolutionary landscape of many eukaryotes . 42 43 3 Author Summary 44 Ploidy is the number of whole sets of chromosomes in a species . Most eukaryotes 45 alternate between a diploid ( two copy ) and haploid ( one copy ) state during their life and 46 sexual cycle . However , as part of normal human development , specific tissues increase 47 their DNA content . This gain of entire sets of chromosomes is known as polyploidization , 48 and it is observed in invertebrates , plants and fungi , as well . Polyploidy is thought to 49 improve fitness under stressful conditions and promote evolutionary diversity , but how 50 ploidy is determined is poorly understood . Here , we use budding yeast to investigate 51 mechanisms underlying the ploidy of wild - type cells and specific mutants that affect the 52 centrosome , a conserved structure involved in chromosome segregation during cell 53 division . Our work suggests that different scaling relationships ( allometry ) between the 54 genome and cellular structures underlies alterations in ploidy . Furthermore , mutations in 55 cellular structures with incompatible allometric relationships with the genome may drive 56 genomic changes such duplications , which are underly the evolution of many species 57 including both yeasts and humans . 58 59 4 Introduction 60 Multiple conserved processes act together to ensure eukaryotic cells maintain a stable 61 chromosome composition , called the karyotype . Most organisms have a diploid 62 karyotype with two copies of each chromosome ( Ezov et al . 2006 ) . In nature , fungi are 63 also commonly diploids , however , a haploid karyotype can be stably maintained in most 64 lab strains ( Gerstein and Otto 2009 ; Herskowitz 1988 ) . Changes in the karyotype 65 through gains or losses of one or more chromosomes leads to aneuploidy , which is 66 associated with miscarriage , cancer and fungal drug resistance ( Gianaroli et al . 1999 ; 67 Storchova and Pellman 2004 ; Selmecki , Forche , and Berman 2006 ; Gordon , Resio , and 68 Pellman 2012 ) . Gains of whole sets of chromosomes ( polyploidy ) is another type of 69 karyotype alteration that has driven evolution of many eukaryotes , including vertebrates 70 and yeast such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Lee , Davidson , and Duronio 2009 ; 71 Selmecki et al . 2015 ; Mittal et al . 2017 ; Otto 2007 ; Harari et al . 2018 ) . Increased ploidy is 72 observed in certain highly differentiated human tissues such as liver parenchyma , heart 73 muscle , placenta and bone marrow ( Anatskaya and Vinogradov 2007 ; Liu et al . 2010 ; 74 Orr - Weaver 2015 ) , and it is frequently observed in plants ( Soltis et al . 2015 ) . However , 75 polyploidy is also linked to aneuploidy as increased ploidy often leads to chromosome 76 instability ( CIN ) ( Amend et al . 2019 ; Storchova and Pellman 2004 ; Kops , Weaver , and 77 Cleveland 2005 ; Fujiwara et al . 2005 ; Mayer and Aguilera 1990 ) . For example , in 78 budding yeast the rate of chromosome loss in triploids and tetraploids is 30 - and 1000 - 79 fold higher than haploids ( Andalis et al . 2004 ) . The mechanism ( s ) resulting in CIN in 80 polyploids are poorly understood but may be linked to incompatible allometries 81 ( biological scaling relationships ) driven by increasing genome size ( Varberg and 82 Jaspersen 2018 ; Hara and Kimura 2011 ; Storchova et al . 2006 ; Andalis et al . 2004 ) . 83 84 5 The cell division cycle is a highly conserved process that ensures chromosomes are 85 replicated and segregated into daughter cells . Throughout eukaryotes , chromosomes 86 are distributed into daughter cells by the mitotic spindle , a microtubule network formed 87 around two spindle poles known as centrosomes in metazoans or spindle pole bodies 88 ( SPBs ) in fungi . Duplication of the centrosome / SPB is coupled with the cell cycle such 89 that cells entering mitosis have exactly two spindle poles to form a bipolar spindle 90 ( Ruthnick and Schiebel 2018 ; Cavanaugh and Jaspersen 2017 ) . Errors in centrosome 91 duplication result in the formation of monopolar or multipolar spindles . This has long 92 been considered a driving factor in aneuploidy and polyploidy despite mechanisms to 93 cluster multipolar spindles or surveillance mechanisms to detect spindle defects ( Vitre 94 and Cleveland 2012 ) . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae a mutant defective in SPB 95 duplication was isolated by Lee Hartwell in his famous screen for cell division cycle 96 mutants ( Hartwell et al . 1973 ) . cdc31 - 1 ( allelic to cdc31 - 2 used here ) mutants arrest in 97 metaphase due to monopolar spindles . Although the mutant was isolated in a yeast with 98 a haploid karyotype , cdc31 - 1 cells were found to be polyploid ( diploid ) ( Schild , 99 Ananthaswamy , and Mortimer 1981 ) . This phenotype of spontaneous diploidization is 100 not unique to cdc31 - 1 , also having been described for other SPB components and 101 regulators ( Sing et al . 2018 ; Jaspersen , Giddings , and Winey 2002 ; Jaspersen et al . 102 2006 ; Chen et al . 2019 ; Kupke et al . 2011 ; Vallen et al . 1994 ; Winey et al . 1991 ; Chial et 103 al . 1999 ) . 104 105 In the electron microscope , the SPB appears as a trilaminar plaque - like structure 106 embedded in the nuclear membrane ( Byers and Goetsch 1974 ) . Associated with one 107 side is a specialized region of the nuclear envelope known as the half - bridge . 108 Molecularly , the ~ 1 GDa SPB is composed of 18 components present in multiple copies . 109 Each protein localizes to a distinct region in the SPB , including the core , the half - bridge 110 6 or the membrane region that anchors the SPB to the nuclear envelope ( referred to here 111 as the SPB luminal ring ) ( Cavanaugh and Jaspersen 2017 ; Ruthnick and Schiebel 112 2018 ) . The half - bridge plays an essential role in SPB duplication while the ultimate 113 function of the core is microtubule nucleation . 114 115 Polyploidy may result from errors in chromosome segregation , but , somewhat 116 paradoxically , increases in ploidy expand the burden of chromosomes that must be 117 replicated and segregated by the cell cycle machinery . While polyploidy does not lead to 118 the proteotoxic stress observed in many aneuploids ( Sheltzer and Amon 2011 ; 119 Oromendia and Amon 2014 ) , genetic analysis of haploid , diploid and tetraploid yeast 120 cells pointed to three processes that are essential for genome stability in cells of higher 121 ploidy ( tetraploids ) but non - essential in cells of lower ploidy ( haploids and diploids ) : 122 homologous recombination , sister chromatid cohesion and mitotic spindle function 123 ( Storchova et al . 2006 ; Storchova 2014 ) . In yeast , where a single microtubule binds to 124 each chromosome via its kinetochore ( Joglekar et al . 2006 ) , the number of microtubules 125 must scale with ploidy . Consistent with this idea , the size of the SPB core , measured by 126 electron microscopy ( EM ) as the diameter across its central region , increases linearly 127 with ploidy : from 90 - 110 nm in haploids , to 160 nm in diploids and 240 nm in tetraploids 128 ( Adams and Kilmartin 1999 ; Kilmartin 2003 ; Byers and Goetsch 1974 ) . How the SPB 129 scales in size is unknown . The simplest idea , that polyploids have extra copies of SPB 130 genes , seems insufficient as the SPB of haploid cells can also scale in size when the cell 131 cycle is delayed or when the number of centromeres is increased ( Winey et al . 1993 ; 132 Nannas et al . 2014 ) . In addition , in SPB mutants that spontaneously diploidize , the cell 133 must build a larger SPB and nucleate more microtubules – so it is unclear why the 134 mutation would not result in another error in segregation that would further increase 135 ploidy . 136 7 137 In metazoans , centrosome size also correlates with spindle size , and changes in its size 138 have been linked to defects in chromosome segregation , aneuploidy and cancer ( Vitre 139 and Cleveland 2012 ; Cabral et al . 2019 ; Marshall 2011 ; Marteil et al . 2018 ) . Here , we 140 used budding yeast as a model system to examine the relationship between ploidy 141 changes and SPB size scaling at a molecular level . We examined the polyploidy 142 associated with SPB mutants and performed a genetic screen to isolate suppressors of 143 cdc31 - 2 diploidization . We found that spontaneous diploidization rescues the growth 144 defect associated with some , but not all , SPB mutants . Our data shows that mutations 145 that are rescued by increased ploidy are only found in genes encoding specific SPB 146 components that localize to regions of the SPB structure that we show do not scale 147 linearly with chromosome number . We propose that polyploidy acts as a ‘dosage’ 148 suppressor and that acquisition of malfunctional centrosomes could drive eukaryotic 149 evolution or disease progression by promoting changes such as whole genome 150 duplication . 151 152 8 Results 153 Spontaneous diploidization in SPB mutants 154 Cdc31 is the yeast centrin ortholog , a small , highly conserved calcium binding protein 155 present at centrosomes and other microtubule - organizing centers ( MTOCs ) across 156 eukaryotes . A temperature - sensitive mutation in cdc31 - 2 ( E133K ) causes haploid yeast 157 cells to undergo spontaneous diploidization at the permissive growth temperature ( 23°C ) 158 immediately upon loss of a wild - type copy of CDC31 , a phenotype we will refer to as 159 increase - in - ploidy ( IPL ) ( Chan and Botstein 1993 ) . The IPL phenotype is observed by 160 flow cytometry as 2N and 4N peaks compared to the 1N and 2N peaks seen in haploid 161 cells ( Figure 1A ) . Whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) of cdc31 - 2 mutants shows that the 162 IPL is an example of autopolyploidy , with two exact copies of each chromosome ( diploid 163 control in Figure 2D , Table S1 ) . Examination of spindle structure by fluorescence 164 microscopy showed that 59 % of cdc31 - 2 large budded cells contained a bipolar spindle 165 ( Figure 1A ) . Interestingly , we did not observe evidence of cdc31 - 2 progressing to 166 tetraploids , suggesting that these mutants are maintained as stable diploids with fully 167 compensated microtubule nucleation ability as a result of their IPL phenotype . Together , 168 these results show that loss of Cdc31 function at 23°C can be overcome by spontaneous 169 transition to a diploid state . 170 171 It is unclear why the mutant cells are able to divide as stable diploids without forming 172 tetraploids . One possibility is that tetraploids do indeed form but are quickly reverted to 173 diploids through chromosome loss although the perfect ploidy of the cdc31 - 2 diploids 174 argues against this possibility . The IPL phenotype of cdc31 - 2 and other mutants is 175 thought to arise from a monopolar cell division in haploids , resulting in an aploid cell that 176 dies and a diploid cell that is able to undergo successful divisions as a diploid 177 ( Jaspersen , Giddings , and Winey 2002 ; Sing et al . 2018 ) . Additionally , acquisition of 178 9 suppressor mutation that bypasses the SPB defect caused by the original mutation may 179 be involved in diploidization ( Figure 1B ) . 180 181 Suppressors of cdc31 - 2 spontaneous diploidization 182 To determine the mechanisms that drive the cdc31 - 2 IPL phenotype and prevent further 183 increases in ploidy , we developed a forward genetic screen to identify suppressors of the 184 spontaneous diploidization observed in cdc31 - 2 mutants ( Figure 2A ) . Because cdc31 - 2 185 is a recessive mutation , we maintained cells as haploids using a plasmid containing a 186 wild - type copy of CDC31 ( pURA3 - CDC31 ) , known as a covering or complementing 187 plasmid . Haploid MATα cdc31 - 2 pURA3 - CDC31 cells were mutagenized with ethyl 188 methanesulfonate ( EMS ) , individual mutagenized cells were selected , and the covering 189 plasmid then was removed by growth on 5 - fluoroorotic acid ( 5 - FOA ) . Cells that contain 190 an IPL suppressor are haploid while the remainder spontaneously diploidize due to the 191 cdc31 - 2 allele that is uncovered following plasmid loss ( Figure 2A ) . 192 193 In budding yeast , the ability to sexually reproduce is not controlled by chromosome 194 number but rather by the mating type locus ( MAT ) present on chromosome III . Typical 195 diploids are heterozygous for MAT ( MATa / MATα ) and are therefore able to undergo 196 meiosis to produce four viable haploid progeny known as spores . Triploid meiosis 197 ( MATa / MATa / MATα or MATa / MATα / MATα ) is catastrophic because few spores contain 198 chromosome combinations compatible with life . In our strain background , the viability of 199 meiotic progeny from diploid meiosis in yeast homozygous for cdc31 - 2 is 88 . 2 % while 200 the viability of progeny from triploids is 6 . 2 % ( Figure 2B ) . We therefore screened for 201 suppressors of IPL through a selection scheme involving a non - mutagenized MATa 202 cdc31 - 2 pURA3 - CDC31 strain mated with the EMS - induced mutant library . In this 203 system , only cdc31 - 2 cells that contain a suppressor of spontaneous diploidization will 204 10 mate to form diploids , undergo a successful meiosis and generate viable progeny . In 205 contrast , cells that spontaneously diploidized will mate to form triploids , which will die 206 under the meiotic selection conditions ( Figure 2B ) . 207 208 Of ~ 100 , 000 EMS mutagenized cells that were screened as described , we isolated 61 209 possible suppressors of the cdc31 - 2 IPL phenotype ( Figure 2C ) . To confirm that these 210 cells had suppressed diploidization , we performed flow cytometry on all 61 hits . Of 211 these , 54 displayed predominately 1N and 2N peaks characteristic of haploid cells and 212 these were pursued further . Our system utilizes selection with 5 - FOA , which is converted 213 into a toxic metabolite in yeast containing URA3 ( Boeke et al . 1987 ) . If a mutation is 214 introduced into the URA3 gene by EMS , haploid cdc31 - 2 cells containing the covering 215 plasmid would be able to grow on this counter - selection . To remove these potential false 216 positives , we tested our 54 potential suppressors and found that 43 retained the 217 covering plasmid . Further evaluation of these remaining 11 suppressor strains showed 218 that each was linked to a single locus in the nuclear genome . Suppression of the cdc31 - 219 2 IPL in one tetrad is shown in Figure 2C . 220 221 From these eleven suppressors , we chose three for further characterization by Illumina 222 sequencing . Pooled genomic DNA from 20 meiotic progeny with and without the 223 suppressor was analyzed . No single nucleotide or insertion / deletion polymorphisms 224 were shared among all three strains , suggesting that suppression was not caused by a 225 change in a single gene shared by all three mutants ( Table S1 ) . An obvious suppressor 226 mutation within the genome also was not obvious . Strikingly , all three suppressors 227 showed increased read depth for the entire length of chromosome XV relative to control 228 when compared to all other chromosomes ( Figure 2D ) . Thus , all three suppressors of 229 11 cdc31 - 2 IPL contained two complete copies of chromosome XV while retaining a single 230 copy of all other chromosomes . 231 232 Using a quantitative PCR assay ( Wang et al . 2002 ) , we determined that the increased 233 copy number for chromosome XV was present in all eleven isolated suppressors ( Figure 234 2E ) . Most contained a single copy of chromosomes I - XIV and chromosome XVI , 235 however , one ( ems5 ) had a more complex karyotype that may be due chromosome 236 rearrangements such as diploidization followed by chromosome loss ( Figure 2E ) . 237 Alternatively , this mutant may exhibit cell to cell variation in chromosome content . 238 Because all cells contained two copies of chromosome XV , this phenotype was further 239 characterized as it suggests that disomy for chromosome XV can suppresses IPL of 240 cdc31 - 2 . 241 242 Increased cdc31 - 2 dosage suppresses diploidization 243 Cells disomic for chromosome XV exhibit a number of phenotypes , including a short 244 delay in G1 phase of the cell cycle and a small increase in cell volume compared to 245 normal haploid cells ( Torres et al . 2007 ; Torres et al . 2010 ; Bonney , Moriya , and Amon 246 2015 ) . However , these phenotypes seem unlikely to be related to the mechanism of 247 cdc31 - 2 suppression since we did not recover disomies for other chromosomes with 248 similar effects on cell size and the cell cycle , nor did they suppress cdc31 - 2 IPL when 249 directly tested . The specificity for chromosome XV suggests that suppression is linked to 250 a gene or genes located on that chromosome , which are known to be upregulated in 251 disomic strains relative to the rest of the haploid genome ( Mulla , Zhu , and Li 2014 ) . It 252 seems likely that doubling the dosage of the gene ( s ) on chromosome XV is sufficient to 253 alleviate the defect in SPB duplication that occurs in haploid cdc31 - 2 mutants . 254 12 Importantly , the CDC31 locus is located on the right arm of chromosome XV , making 255 cdc31 - 2 itself a leading candidate for dosage - mediated suppression . 256 257 To test the idea that cdc31 - 2 itself suppresses IPL , we first tested if cdc31 - 2 was 258 necessary for suppression in the disomic strain ( cdc31 - 2 2xChXV ) ( Figure 3A ) . Deletion 259 of one copy of cdc31 - 2 ( cdc31 - 2 2xChXV ( cdc31∆ : : KANMX ) ) reduced growth at 23°C 260 compared to the disomic control to a level similar to cdc31 - 2 mutants ( Figure 3A , C ) . 261 These cells also spontaneously diploidized like cdc31 - 2 ( Figure 3B ) . Thus , it appears 262 that the cdc31 - 2 locus is necessary for suppression of IPL in the disomic strain . 263 264 To test if an extra single copy of cdc31 - 2 is sufficient to suppress IPL , we integrated a 265 single copy of cdc31 - 2 containing its endogenous promoter , terminator and coding 266 sequence into a covered haploid cdc31 - 2 strain at the HIS3 locus on chromosome XV 267 ( Figure 3D ) . We also constructed isogenic strains containing an empty vector or wild - 268 type CDC31 at HIS3 as controls ( Figure 3D ) . As shown in Figure 3E , a single extra copy 269 of cdc31 - 2 integrated into the genome in combination with cdc31 - 2 at the genomic locus 270 ( cdc31 - 2 his3 : : cdc31 - 2 - HIS3 ) is sufficient to suppress IPL observed in cdc31 - 2 mutants 271 after removal of the covering plasmid on 5 - FOA . These cells grow as well , or better , than 272 cdc31 - 2 mutants that spontaneously diploidize or cdc31 - 2 carrying a chromosome XV 273 disome ( Figure 3C & F ) . This could be due the fact that a single gene rather than 274 multiple genes is altered , resulting in little or no changes in the overall cellular proteome . 275 Despite increased growth at 23°C and 30°C , two copies of cdc31 - 2 are unable to 276 suppress temperature sensitivity at 37°C ( Figure 3C & F ) . This finding suggests that the 277 copy number - based suppression of IPL at 23°C occurs via a different mechanism than 278 dosage suppression of cdc31 ts alleles at 37°C , which is probably based on bypassing , 279 stabilizing or upregulating the mutant protein . 280 13 281 SPB scaling along with ploidy change 282 One effect of polyploidy is an increase in the size of intracellular structures . Based on 283 EM analysis of SPB structure , SPB diameter ( measured at the SPB core ) increases from 284 110 nm in haploid cells to 160 nm in diploids ; however , SPB height does not change 285 ( Byers and Goetsch 1974 ) ( Figure 4A - B ) . The length of the half - bridge also does not 286 change when ploidy is increased , and its width may only marginally increase ( Figure 287 4B ) . One possibility linking spontaneous diploidization to a subset of SPB mutants such 288 as cdc31 - 2 is based on ‘dosage suppression’ – diploids have two gene copies , and 289 presumably twice the amount of protein , to make the same structure that is needed in 290 both haploids and diploids . For other SPB mutants , diploidization would not have the 291 same effect as a larger structure requiring more protein is built . 292 293 A rigorous test of this idea involves the comparison of protein levels at the SPB for 294 different components . If our hypothesis is correct , levels of core proteins will be higher 295 in diploids compared to haploids , as the size of the core , in theory , scales approximately 296 two - fold between haploids and diploids . Alternatively , a similar increase in ploidy should 297 not affect levels of half - bridge proteins since its size is thought to be similar in haploids 298 and diploids ( Kilmartin 2003 ) . We anticipated that levels of the luminal ring would also 299 increase in size in diploids , although given the differences in geometry and organization 300 the luminal ring may not increase to the same extent as the core ( Figure 4B ) . To directly 301 test these hypotheses , we compared the intensity of multiple SPB components 302 endogenously - tagged with mTurquoise2 at the C - terminus in both haploid and 303 homozygous diploid strains , with the exception of Kar1 , which was tagged at the N - 304 terminus . We were unable to functionally tag Cdc31 , similar to previous reports ( Yoder et 305 al . 2003 ; Jaspersen , Giddings , and Winey 2002 ; Kilmartin 2003 ) . SPB components 306 14 clustered into three groups based on the intensity increase observed in diploids : no / mild 307 ( up to 1 . 1 - fold ) , modest ( 1 . 1 - 1 . 4 - fold ) and major ( over 1 . 4 - fold ) increase . Somewhat 308 unexpectedly , none showed the anticipated increased fluorescence intensity based on 309 scaling models and EM measurements ( Figure 4C ) . For example , core SPB 310 components ( Spc110 , Spc29 , Tub4 , Spc42 ) , which underwent major scaling , showed a 311 ~ 1 . 4 - 1 . 5 - fold increase in diploids . 312 313 The group that showed a mild increase in diploids contained components of the luminal 314 ring : Nbp1 , Bbp1 and Mps2 ( Figure 4C ) . The observation that this SPB substructure 315 does not scale as predicted in our theoretical model could be caused by heterogeneity in 316 ring shape ( Chen et al . 2019 ) or by a difference in the actual mechanism of ring 317 expansion . During post - mitotic nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) assembly , the membrane 318 ring expands through a process known as radial dilation ( Shahin et al . 2005 ; Otsuka et 319 al . 2018 ) . A constant total amount of protein is spread over an expanding NPC core , 320 decreasing protein area with the increase in size . Our data suggests that the luminal ring 321 expands by a similar radial dilation process ( Figure 4C ) . 322 323 The levels of half - bridge proteins Sfi1 and Kar1 showed a modest increase in diploids 324 ( Figure 4C ) . This suggests that the width of the bridge scales a small amount from 325 haploids to diploids . Mps3 also showed an increase ; as a dual component of the half - 326 bridge and the luminal ring ( Chen et al . 2019 ) , this is consistent with bridge scaling ( as 327 seen for Sfi1 and Kar1 ) and radial dilation ( as seen for Nbp1 , Bbp1 and Mps2 ) . Although 328 we were unable to visualize Cdc31 microscopically , we found that an extra copy of 329 CDC31 resulted in a 50 % increase in total Cdc31 levels , measured by western blotting 330 of whole cell extracts ( Figure 4D ) . As Cdc31 is present at multiple structures throughout 331 the cell ( Fischer et al . 2004 ; Chen and Madura 2008 ; Myers and Payne 2017 ) , this would 332 15 likely reflect a moderate increase in its levels at the SPB , similar to the trend we 333 observed for the other half - bridge components , Sfi1 , Kar1 and Mps3 . Overall , our data 334 are consistent with the idea that IPL may be linked to scaling of the SPB . 335 336 Gene dosage as a general mechanism to suppress IPL in SPB mutants 337 Diploidization is not unique to cdc31 - 2 , but it is also observed in other SPB mutants , 338 including some , but not , all alleles of MPS3 , KAR1 , NBP1 and MPS2 ( Table 1 ) . The fact 339 that the phenotype is limited to half - bridge and luminal ring SPB components may be 340 due in part to the fact that these SPB substructures do not or only modestly scale in size 341 ( Figure 4B - C ) . However , the observation that it is limited to certain specific alleles 342 suggests the dosage - dependent IPL mechanism also involves the mutant protein and its 343 role at the SPB . For example , a common defect in SPB duplication may underly the IPL 344 phenotype ( Figure 5A ) . 345 346 To determine if gene dosage is a general mechanism able to suppress SPB alleles , we 347 were interested in determining if other mutants , like cdc31 - 2 , would survive as haploids if 348 an extra copy of the mutant gene was introduced at an ectopic site in the genome . We 349 first tested the mutant allele with the phenotype most similar to cdc31 - 2 : kar1∆17 , which 350 contains a partial deletion in the Cdc31 binding domain ( Vallen et al . 1994 ) . Using a 351 covered haploid strain , we integrated a single extra copy of kar1∆17 into the genome of 352 the kar1∆17 mutant at a marker locus . A single extra copy of kar1∆17 suppressed 353 diploidization at 23°C in a small fraction of cells ; however , most cells were of higher 354 ploidy ( Figure 5B ) . Next , we examined other SPB mutant alleles that have a SPB 355 duplication defect similar to cdc31 - 2 ( Vallen et al . 1994 ; Jaspersen , Giddings , and Winey 356 2002 ; Jaspersen et al . 2006 ; Chen et al . 2019 ; Winey et al . 1991 ; Kupke et al . 2011 ) . An 357 extra copy of mps3 - 1 or mps2 - 381 completely suppressed diploidization , similar to 358 16 cdc31 - 2 , while mps3 - A540D resulted in a partial rescue like kar1∆17 ( Figure 5B ) . 359 Growth fitness improved in all the alleles with doubled gene copy number at all 360 temperatures . Although many mutants ( cdc31 - 2 , mps3 - 1 and mps2 - 381 ) affecting 361 initiation of SPB duplication can be suppressed through the addition of an extra copy of 362 a mutant gene , increasing the dosage of other mutants only partially rescued IPL , 363 suggesting the nature of the mutation is important to dosage - based diploidization 364 suppression . 365 366 Examination of additional mutant alleles provided insights into the dosage - based 367 diploidization survival mechanism . Three MPS3 alleles ( mps3 - 1 , mps3 - A540D and 368 mps3 - W477A ) containing lesions in the C - terminal SUN domain that disrupt 369 nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton ( LINC ) complex formation exhibit different degrees of 370 IPL suppression ( Figure 5B ) . Interestingly , increasing the dosage of mps3 - W477A poorly 371 suppressed its IPL phenotype . While this could be attributed to the allele , the fact that 372 the mps3∆2 - 150 mutant also shows a similar phenotype points to another contributing 373 factor . Unlike most MPS3 alleles which are defective in initiation of SPB duplication , 374 mps3 - W477A and mps3∆2 - 150 block SPB insertion ( Figure 5A ) ( Friederichs et al . 2011 ; 375 Chen et al . 2019 ) . Examination of two additional insertion mutants ( mps2 - 1 or nbp1∆AH ) 376 showed that extra copies of these genes also did not rescue IPL or restore growth when 377 added in extra copy ( Figure 5A ; data not shown ) . Collectively , these data support the 378 idea that spontaneous diploidization serves as a dosage suppressor for specific SPB 379 mutants that primarily affect initiation of SPB duplication . 380 381 382 17 Discussion 383 While lab strains of budding yeast are often maintained as stable haploid or diploid 384 populations , polyploidy is common in natural yeast isolates ( Ezov et al . 2006 ) . The 385 higher DNA state of triploid or diploid yeast allows for adaptation through the 386 accumulation of mutations , some of which can be beneficial for fitness . However , higher 387 ploidy is also associated with CIN , raising the question as to how cells maintain a stable 388 ploidy . 389 390 Over the years , mutations in a number of pathways have been linked to spontaneous 391 diploidization of haploid yeast strains , including : 1 ) mating type mutations , which 392 restores the diploid state through mating - type switching ( Lee et al . 2010 ) ; 2 ) cytokinetic 393 mutants that fail in cell division to give rise to binucleate diploids ( Rancati et al . 2008 ) ; 394 and 3 ) spindle mutants that result in errors in chromosome segregation to produce 395 mononuclear diploids ( Sing et al . 2018 ; Luca and Winey 1998 ; Antoniacci et al . 2004 ; 396 Chambers et al . 2012 ; Pinto and Winston 2000 ; Yu et al . 2011 ; Chan and Botstein 397 1993 ) . Here , we investigated the IPL phenotype associated with certain mutations in the 398 yeast SPB . Given SPB mutations are linked to chromosome segregation defects , an 399 unresolved issue is why these alleles can be propagated as diploids under permissive 400 conditions . While it is possible that tetraploids and octaploids do form , these higher 401 ploidies are not detected for most alleles using flow cytometry . WGS of multiple SPB 402 mutants also does not indicate disomes or other aneuploids are formed at least at the 403 population level . For cdc31 - 2 mutants , it was necessary to treat cells with a chemical 404 mutagen and passage them through meiosis to create a disomic strain . This indicates 405 that diploidization is the preferred ploidy of certain SPB mutants . Our goal was to 406 understand the mechanism behind this ploidy regulation . 407 408 18 We describe how specific SPB mutations undergo dosage - based spontaneous 409 diploidization . This phenotype is due , at least in part , to scaling of SPB architecture from 410 haploid to diploid cells . Partial loss of function mutants that affect the first step of SPB 411 duplication and whose gene products localize to SPB substructures that do no scale 412 ( luminal ring ) or moderately scale ( half - bridge ) use diploidization to increase their copy 413 number and to eliminate defects in SPB function at the permissive temperature . Thus , 414 cdc31 - 2 , mps3 - 1 and mps2 - 381 mutants are able to propagate as diploids . Importantly , 415 extra copies of these genes do not overcome the growth defects and SPB phenotypes 416 seen at higher temperatures , presumably because the mutant proteins are unstable at 417 37°C or the SPB duplication defect is not bypassed . Other SPB alleles such as 418 kar1∆17 , mps3 - A540D , mps3 - W477A and nbp1 - AH also show diploidization , but the IPL 419 phenotype of haploids was not fully rescued by an additional copy of the mutant gene . 420 While our ectopic rescue constructs may not express the gene at levels comparable to 421 the endogenous locus , the fact that a disome did not suppress the IPL associated with 422 mps3 - A540D suggests a non - dosage dependent diploidization rescue pathway also 423 exists . 424 425 In previous work , incompatible allometry within the spindle was linked with the CIN 426 phenotype in S . cerevisae and other fungi ( Jelenic et al . 2018 ; Hoyt , Stearns , and 427 Botstein 1990 ) . Although the surface area of the SPB increases to expand microtubule 428 nucleation capacity , the length of the pre - anaphase spindle does not change in 429 tetraploids compared to diploids even though tetraploid cells have twice the DNA 430 content . As a result , the incidence of syntelic ( monopolar ) chromosome attachments is 431 higher in tetraploids ( Storchova et al . 2006 ) . The loss of chromosomes from tetraploid C . 432 albicans is so dramatic that it results in diploid or near diploid progeny ( Bennett and 433 Johnson 2003 ) . Unlike the SPB core , we show here that the luminal ring does not 434 19 increase in size to a similar extent in diploids compared to haploids . This finding 435 strongly suggests that , similar to the NPC , this region of the SPB expands and contracts 436 via radial dilation . This mechanism of scaling could facilitate cell cycle changes in the 437 luminal ring size without the need to incorporate more protein . For example , in haploids 438 the SPB core size increases from 90 nm in G1 to 110 nm in mitosis ( Byers and Goetsch 439 1974 ) ; radial expansion of the luminal ring would accommodate this increase without 440 incorporation of new protein . Similarly , as SPB size decreases back to 90 nm upon 441 anaphase exit , radial contraction of the SPB would allow the luminal ring to shrink by 442 increasing protein density . 443 444 In metazoans , centrosome function is regulated by factors involved in its duplication , 445 maturation and microtubule nucleation . Centrosomal defects are linked to errors in 446 chromosome segregation , in part due to the role of centrosomes in spindle organization . 447 However , centrosomes also contribute to the size of the mitotic spindle . Our work further 448 illustrates another possible role for centrosomes in driving genetic changes – the 449 acquisition of mutations in genes such as centrin , which is conserved throughout 450 eukaryotes , might promote stable genome amplification , including the genome 451 duplications seen throughout evolution in fungi and metazoans or during tumorigenesis 452 in humans . 453 454 455 20 Materials & Methods 456 Yeast strains and plasmids 457 All strains are derivatives of W303 ( ADE2 trp1 - 1 leu2 - 3 , 112 ura3 - 1 his3 - 11 , 15 can1 - 100 458 RAD5 + ) and are listed in Table S2 . Standard techniques were used for DNA and yeast 459 manipulations , including C - terminal tagging with fluorescent proteins and gene deletion 460 by PCR - based methods ( Gardner and Jaspersen 2014 ) . Single copy integrating 461 plasmids containing SPB genes were made by PCR amplifying the open - reading frame , 462 ~ 700 bp of promoter sequence and ~ 200 bp of the terminator from genomic DNA and 463 assembling this DNA into pRG203MX using Gateway assembly ( Gnugge , Liphardt , and 464 Rudolf 2016 ) . Mutations were introduced by site - directed mutagenesis of the wild - type 465 gene using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit ( Agilent ) . Sequencing was performed to 466 confirm correct base pair substitutions or deletions were made . 467 468 Screen for cdc31 - 2 IPL suppressors 469 SLJ6749 ( MATα cdc31 - 2 CAN1 : : KANMX trp1∆ : : NATMX cyh2 LYP1 ura3 - 1 his3 - 11 , 15 470 ade2 - 1 pURA3 - CDC31 ) was grown overnight at 30°C in SC - Ura plus casamino acids to 471 an OD 600 of ~ 2 . 0 . Cells were harvested and individual aliquots were mutagenized with a 472 dosage of EMS that resulted in ~ 50 % lethality compared to an untreated control . 473 Following mutagenesis , cells were plated to YPD at 23°C at which time individual 474 colonies were cherry - picked into 96 - well plates to allow for automated pinning using the 475 Singer ROTOR ( Singer Instruments ) . Next , loss of the pURA3 - CDC31 covering plasmid 476 was selected by growing cells on 5 - FOA for 3 d at 23°C . Mating to SLJ6750 ( MATa 477 cdc31 - 2 can1∆ : : STE2pr - HIS3MX CYH2 lyp1∆ : : HYGMX ura3 - 1 trp1 - 1 his3 - 11 , 15 ade2 - 1 ) 478 was performed overnight on YPD ; mated cells were selected by growth on YPD 479 containing 200 µg / ml G418 and 300 µg / ml hygromycin for 3 d . Cells were transferred 480 onto sporulation media for 3 weeks at 23°C . Meiotic progeny were selected by two 481 21 rounds of growth on SD - His - Lys - Arg containing 50 µg / ml canavanine , 50 µg / ml 482 thialysine and 10 µg / ml cycloheximide for 3 d at 23°C . Suppressors of cdc31 - 2 IPL give 483 rise to colonies under these growth conditions . 484 485 From ~ 100 , 000 EMS mutagenized cells , 61 possible suppressors were identified . Flow 486 cytometric analysis of DNA content showed that 54 exhibited peaks at 1N and 2N , which 487 are typically observed in haploid yeast . Of these , we found using plasmid rescue , PCR 488 and sequencing that 43 contained mutations in the URA3 gene on the covering plasmid 489 that allowed for growth on 5 - FOA , thus these were false positives . The remaining 11 490 suppressors were analyzed by tetrad dissection to ensure that suppression segregates 491 2 : 2 through at least two crosses to SLJ6121 ( MATa cdc31 - 2 can1∆ : : STE2pr - HIS3MX 492 TRP1 CYH2 ura3 - 1 his3 - 11 , 15 ade2 - 1 pURA3 - CDC31 ) . 493 494 Whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) 495 Using 20 four - spored tetrads from a cross between an EMS - induced hit and SLJ6121 , 496 we identified the two progeny from each tetrad that were diploid ( control ) and the two 497 progeny from each tetrad that were haploid ( and therefore contained an ems hit ) . To 498 ensure equal representation of colonies , each was individually grown , normalized by 499 OD 600 , then mixed to achieve equal number of all 40 cells in the control and ems hit 500 pools . Genomic libraries were prepared using the Illumina Mate Pair library kit and 501 prepared for paired - end sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq as previously described 502 ( Birkeland et al . 2010 ) . Downstream sequence analysis was performed ( Birkeland et al . 503 2010 ) . Reads were aligned to sacCer3 using bwa version 0 . 7 . 15 - r1140 ( Li and Durbin 504 2009 ) and single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and insertion / deletion 505 polymorphisms were identified using SAMtools version 1 . 5 ( Li et al . 2009 ) . SNP and 506 insertion / deletion polymorphisms were annotated using snpEff version 4 . 3 ( Cingolani et 507 22 al . 2012 ) . Coverage was calculated using BEDTools version 2 . 25 . 0 ( Quinlan and Hall 508 2010 ) . Results are listed in Table S1 . 509 510 Flow cytometry and qPCR karyotyping 511 DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry in sonicated cells that had been fixed with 512 70 % ethanol for 1 h at room temperature , treated with RNAse ( Roche , Basel , 513 Switzerland ) and Proteinase K ( Roche ) for 2 h to overnight at 37°C and stained with 514 propidium iodide ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis ) in the dark at 4°C overnight . Samples were 515 analyzed on a MACSQuant FACS Analyzer ( Miltenyi Biotec ) and data was displayed 516 using FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Ashland , OR ) . qPCR karyotyping was performed 517 using centromere proximal primers for each chromosome arm as previously described 518 ( Pavelka , Rancati , and Li 2010 ) . 519 520 Growth assay 521 To analyze growth phenotypes , 5 OD 600 of cells from each strain were serially diluted in 522 10 - fold , and ~ 7 µl of each dilution was spotted on SD - Ura or SD plates containing 5 - FOA 523 ( Sigma Aldrich ) . Plates were incubated at indicated temperatures for 2 - 4 days . 524 525 Image analysis 526 Live cell imaging was used to study spindle structure in cells containing GFP - Tub1 527 ( microtubules ) and Spc42 - Cherry ( SPBs ) using a Perkin Elmer ( Waltham , MA , USA ) 528 Ultraview spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ( Hamamatsu , 529 Japan ) EMCCD ( C9100 - 13 ) optimized for speed , sensitivity and resolution . The 530 microscope base was a Carl Zeiss ( Jena , Germany ) Axio - observer equipped with an 531 αPlan - Apochromat 100x 1 . 46NA oil immersion objective and a multiband dichroic 532 reflecting 488 and 561 nm laser lines . GFP images were acquired with 488 nm excitation 533 23 and 500 - 550 nm emission . mCherry images were acquired with 561 nm excitation and 534 580 - 650 nm emission . Data were acquired using the PerkinElmer Volocity software with 535 a z spacing of 0 . 4 µm . Exposure time , laser power and camera gain were maintained at 536 a constant level chosen to provide high signal - to - noise but avoid signal saturation for all 537 samples . Images were processed using Image J ( NIH , Bethesda , MD ) . A representative 538 z slice image is shown . Cells were considered to be large - budded if the bud size was 539 > 30 % the size of the mother cell . 540 541 Images for SPB intensity quantification in isogenic haploids and diploids were captured 542 with a Nikon Spinning Disk controlled with NIS - Elements Viewer software equipped 543 EMCCD camera and a PlanApo 100x 1 . 4 NA objective . Parameters , including laser 544 power , exposure time , z - spacing and number of stacks , were set to identical 545 value . Quantitation of levels of SPB proteins was performed with custom plugins ( freely 546 available at http : / / research . stowers . org / imagejplugins ) written for ImageJ ( NIH , 547 Bethesda , MD ) . Prior to analysis , raw images were processed with background 548 subtraction and summed to form a single plan image . Individual SPBs were identified 549 using an ImageJ internal function “Find Maxima” and then chose “single points” as 550 output . A circular ROI with a size of 7 pixel was drawn on each single point to cover 551 individual SPB . Integrated intensity was then calculated on all ROIs . 552 553 Western blotting and quantification 554 Pelleted cells were washed in PBS and frozen in liquid nitrogen . Thawed pellets were 555 resuspended in 1 ml lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 , 1 mM 556 DTT , 10 % glycerol and 1 mg / ml each pepstatin A , aprotinin and leupeptin ) and ~ 100 µl 557 of glass beads were added prior to bead beating for 1 min x 5 with 2 min on ice between 558 beatings . Samples were spun at 5000 rpm for 2 min and the supernatant was transferred 559 24 to a new tube . Protein concentration was determined using a NanoDrop 560 Spectrophotometer ( Thermo ) , and equivalent amounts of lysate were analyzed by SDS - 561 PAGE followed by western blotting . Whole cell extracts prepared by bead beating into 562 SDS sample buffer to determine expression levels of baits . The following primary 563 antibody dilutions were used : 1 : 1000 anti - Cdc31 ( in the lab ) and 1 : 5000 anti - Pgk1 564 ( Invitrogen ) . Alkaline phosphatase - conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 565 1 : 10000 ( Promega ) . Western blot band intensity was analyzed with ImageJ Gel 566 quantification tool . 567 568 Acknowledgements 569 We thank Giulia Rancati for strains and are grateful to Scott Hawley , Sarah Smith and 570 members of the Jaspersen Lab for helpful suggestions throughout the project and for 571 their comments on the manuscript .

Spontaneous diploidization of SPB mutants such as cdc31 - 2 at the 857 permissive temperature . ( A ) Wild - type ( SLJ7819 ) and cdc31 - 2 mutant ( SLJ10777 ) 858 cells containing GFP - Tub1 ( white ) and Spc42 - mCherry ( magenta ) were generated with a 859 pURA3 - CDC31 plasmid . After growth on 5 - FOA at 23°C to select for loss of the plasmid , 860 the cdc31 - 2 mutant spontaneously diploidize despite the formation of bipolar spindles . A 861 representative image from each is shown ( bar = 2 μm ) , and the percentage of large 862 budded cells for with bipolar , monopolar or multipolar / broken spindles was quantitated 863 ( n > 150 ) . DNA content was assayed by flow cytometry . The biphasic peaks in wild - type 864 cells represent cells with G1 ( 1N ) and G2 / M ( 2N ) DNA content . At 23°C , cdc31 - 2 865 mutants have diploid DNA content ( 2N and 4N ) . ( B ) Schematic of pathway to 866 diploidization in cdc31 - 2 . Due to a defect in chromosome segregation , haploid ( 1N ) cells 867 undergo an aberrant cell division to produce a diploid ( 2N ) and aploid ( 0N ) cell . The 868 diploid cell does not have the same defect as haploids , resulting in successfully 869 propagation . Because of this , we suspect that a suppressor mutation is acquired . 870 871 Figure 2 . Screen for suppressors of cdc31 - 2 diploidization . ( A ) Suppressors of the 872 cdc31 - 2 increase - in - ploidy were isolated following mutagenesis of SLJ6749 ( MATα 873 cdc31 - 2 CAN1 : : KANMX trp1∆ : : KANMX cyh2 LYP1 ura3 - 1 his3 - 11 , 15 ade2 - 1 pURA3 - 874 CDC31 ) to ~ 50 % viability using EMS . Loss of the pURA3 - CDC31 covering plasmid was 875 selected using 5 - FOA ; strains without a suppressor will spontaneously diploidize as 876 shown in Figure 1 while those with a suppressor will remain haploid . ( B ) Haploid ( 1N ) or 877 diploid ( 2N ) strains can be mated to a haploid to form diploid ( 2N ) or triploid ( 3N ) cells . 878 The viability of meiotic products is high from diploids ( 88 . 2 % , n = 40 tetrads ) compared to 879 triploids ( 6 . 2 % , 40 tetrads ) . Using this property , suppressors of diploidization were 880 selected by mating to SLJ6750 ( MATa CDC31 can1∆ : : STE2pr - HIS3MX CYH2 881 33 lyp1∆ : : HYGMX ura3 - 1 trp1 - 1 his3 - 11 , 15 ade2 - 1 ) on YPD + G418 + Hyg . Following 882 sporulation , haploid selection was carried out using SD - His - Lys - 883 Arg + canavanine + thialysine + cycloheximide . ( C ) From ~ 100 , 000 EMS mutagenized cells , 884 61 possible suppressors were identified , and 54 were confirmed to be haploids in a 885 secondary screen of the original mutagenized colonies by flow cytometric analysis of 886 DNA content . Of these , 43 appeared to have mutations in the covering plasmid that 887 allowed for growth . The remaining 11 suppressors were analyzed by tetrad dissection to 888 ensure that suppression segregates 2 : 2 through at least two crosses to SLJ6121 ( MATa 889 cdc31 - 2 can1∆ : : STE2pr - HIS3MX TRP1 CYH2 ura3 - 1 his3 - 11 , 15 ade2 - 1 pURA3 - 890 CDC31 ) . An example of flow cytometry data from one hit is shown . ( D ) Coverage ratio 891 of all 16 yeast chromosomes in the haploid suppressors ( ems7 , ems9 , or ems11 ) 892 relative to the diploid control ( EMS7 , EMS9 , EMS11 ) . Other single nucleotide 893 polymorphisms and insertions / deletion polymorphisms identified in the haploid 894 suppressors are listed in Table S1 . ( E ) Quantitative PCR was performed on all 11 895 suppressors to determine the mean copy number of all 16 chromosomes relative to a 896 wild - type , with chromosome XV plotted in red . Error bars , standard deviation from the 897 mean . 898 899 Figure 3 . An extra copy of the cdc31 - 2 gene is necessary and sufficient to 900 suppress IPL . ( A ) To test if an extra copy of cdc31 - 2 is necessary to suppress IPL , one 901 copy of the cdc31 - 2 locus was deleted in cells a chromosome XV disome homozygous 902 for cdc31 - 2 , was illustrated in the schematic . ( B - C ) The DNA content ( B ) and growth ( C ) 903 of wild - type ( SLJ7249 ) , cdc31 - 2 ( SLJ809 ) , the chromosome XV cdc31 - 2 disome 904 ( SLJ7106 , cdc31 - 2 2xChXV ( cdc31 - 2 ) ) and the deletion ( ( SLJ7111 , cdc31 - 2 905 ChXV ( cdc31 - 2∆ : : KANMX ) ) that contain pURA3 - CDC31 were compared after growth in 906 SD - Ura or 5 - FOA at the indicated temperatures . ( D ) To test if an extra copy of cdc31 - 2 is 907 34 sufficient to suppress IPL , one additional copy of cdc31 - 2 was inserted into the HIS3 908 locus on chromosome XV . ( E - F ) The DNA content ( E ) and growth ( F ) of wild - type 909 ( SLJ7249 ) , cdc31 - 2 ( SLJ809 ) and cdc31 - 2 with an empty vector , wild - type , CDC31 or 910 cdc31 - 2 at HIS3 ( SLJ13092 , SLJ13093 or SLJ13094 ) were analyzed after growth in SD - 911 Ura or 5 - FOA at the indicated temperatures . 912 913 Figure 4 . Scaling of SPB components with ploidy . ( A ) Schematic of the SPB showing 914 the location of the core , luminal ring and half - bridge . ( B ) Side and top - down views of the 915 SPB from haploids and diploids along with dimensions reported from EM measurements . 916 Assuming the SPB is round and the bridge elliptical and limited to a single protein layer , 917 theoretical scaling factors can be calculated . Based on dimensions calculated from EM 918 measurements , which are shown , a single layer of protein in the SPB core would be 2 . 11 919 times larger in diploids . The half - bridge is thought to be a monolayer of constant length 920 in both haploids and diploids , however , its width may scale . Two potential models for 921 scaling of the luminal ring are depicted : a continuous scaling , where components 922 increase proportionally to the circumference of the SPB core ( 1 . 45 - fold ) ; or radial 923 dilation , where the amount of components do not increase . ( C ) Levels of fluorophore 924 tagged protein derivatives expressed from endogenous loci in haploids or homozygous 925 diploids were determined by quantitative imaging . For each protein , levels in haploid 926 cells were normalized to 1 . Errors , SEM with N > 300 for each sample . ( D ) To determine 927 levels of Cdc31 , western blotting was performed using anti - Cdc31 antibody . Pgk1 served 928 as a loading control . 929 930 Figure 5 . Dosage and IPL in other SPB mutants . ( A ) Schematic of SPB duplication 931 pathway from an unduplicated SPB to duplicated side - by - side SPBs . Mutants defective 932 in initiation , maturation and insertion of the new SPB have been isolated ; shown are 933 35 alleles required at each step that also exhibit IPL at 23°C ( see Table 1 ) . ( B ) To test if an 934 extra copy of these mutant genes is sufficient to suppress IPL , one additional copy was 935 inserted into the HIS3 locus on chromosome XV as in Figure 3D - F . The growth and DNA 936 content of wild - type , mutant and mutant with an empty vector , wild - type gene or mutant 937 gene at HIS3 were analyzed after growth in SD - Ura or 5 - FOA at the indicated 938 temperatures . 939 940 36 Tables 941 Table 1 .
