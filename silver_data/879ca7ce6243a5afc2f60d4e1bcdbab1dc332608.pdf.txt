To investigate the role of cortactin in tumor progression , we analyzed MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells overexpress - ing green fluorescent protein - tagged murine cortactin ( GFP - cortactin ) and a cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation under the control of a retroviral vector . Injection of MDA - MB - 231 cells overexpress - ing GFP - cortactin into nude mice through cardiac ventricles caused bone osteolysis at a frequency (cid:1) 85 % higher than that of cells expressing the vector alone , whereas injection of cells overexpressing the mutant defi - cient in tyrosine phosphorylation induced 74 % fewer osteolytic metastases as compared with the control group . Interestingly , the cells expressing either GFP - cortactin or the mutant did not show significant differences in growth in vitro or when injected m . f . p . in vivo . On the other hand , the cells overexpressing GFP - cortactin but not the mutant acquired a > 60 % en - hanced capability for transendothelial invasion and endothelial cell adhe - sion . These data suggest that cortactin contributes to tumor metastasis by enhancing the interaction of tumor cells with endothelial cells and the invasion of tumor cells into bone tissues . INTRODUCTION Breast cancer cells are known to spread preferentially to bone tissues and ultimately develop osteolytic metastasis ( 1 , 2 ) . Bone metastasis is a major cause of the decline in the quality of life of patients because of uncontrollable bone pain , pathological fractures , hypercalcemia , and nerve compression syndromes ( 3 ) . Despite these well - recognized clinical syndromes , the mechanism that causes breast tumors to target bone tissue remains unclear . Breast cancer is fre - quently associated with gene amplification at chromosome 11q13 , resulting in overexpression of cortactin ( EMS1 ; Ref . 4 ) , a cortical actin - associated protein that is a prominent substrate of the protein tyrosine kinase Src ( 5 , 6 ) . Gene amplification of cortactin is also found frequently in other types of cancer including head and neck squamous carcinoma and bladder cancer ( 7 , 8 ) . Whereas the precise role of cortactin in tumor progression remains unclear , amplification and overexpression of cortactin appear to be intimately associated with patients with poor prognosis or relapse ( 9 ) . This indicates that overexpression of cortactin may contribute to a late stage of tumor progression . Cortactin is accumulated in peripheral structures of cells , including lamellipodia and membrane ruffles , where cortical actin is enriched ( 10 ) . In MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells plated on extracellular matrix , cortactin is enriched in invadopodia , a type of membrane protrusion that participates in degradation of and invasion into the matrix ( 11 ) . The protein sequence of cortactin features six and a half tandem copies of a unique 37 - amino acid repeat domain and a SH3 3 domain at the COOH terminus . Our previous studies have determined that Src - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation occurs primarily at resi - dues Tyr - 421 , Tyr - 466 , and Tyr - 482 , which lie between the repeat and SH3 domains . In vitro , cortactin binds to and cross - links F - actin into meshwork . The F - actin cross - linking activity of cortactin can be reduced on tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Src ( 5 ) . Inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by a selective Src inhibitor reduces the response of endothelial cells to hydrogen peroxide - medi - ated cell injury ( 12 ) . Likewise , overexpression of a cortactin mutant that is deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation can compromise cell shape changes induced by reactive oxygen species , whereas overex - pression of wild - type cortactin results in enhancement of the injury response to hydrogen peroxide ( 12 ) . The role of cortactin in cytoskel - etal reorganization is further highlighted by the recent finding that cortactin binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex and activates Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization ( 13 ) . Thus , cortactin appears to act as a signaling molecule in the regulation of the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton in a tyrosine phosphorylation - dependent manner . Although the biochemical and cellular function of cortactin and its relationship to poor prognosis in a subset of cancers suggest that cortactin may play a role in tumor metastasis , direct evidence is lacking . In this study , we examined the metastatic ability of MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells overexpressing wild - type cortactin and a cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation . We report here that overexpression of wild - type cortactin promoted the metastatic potential of tumor cells , whereas overexpression of the phosphoryla - tion - deficient cortactin mutant inhibited metastasis . In addition , we demonstrate that cortactin influences the interaction of tumor cells with endothelial cells . Thus , our study provides , for the first time , direct evidence of the role of cortactin in tumor metastasis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents .

Viral Infection . MDA - MB - 231 cells were plated on 35 - mm dishes at a density of 1 (cid:2) 10 5 cells / dish . On the next day , the medium was replaced with 1 ml of viral supernatant containing 8 (cid:1) g / ml Polybrene . After 48 h of incubation , the culture medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10 % FBS . Expression of GFP proteins was monitored by fluorescence microscopy . To increase the efficiency of infection , the cells were reinfected with the virus two or three times , and the infected cells were enriched further by FACS . FACS Analysis . MDA - MB - 231 cells ( 2 (cid:2) 10 6 ) infected with cortactin viruses were trypsinized , washed , and suspended in PBS supplemented with 2 % FBS . The suspended cells were sorted in a FACS system ( Becton Dick - inson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) according to light scatter and fluorescence intensity . Sorted cells with expression efficiencies from 85 – 98 % were used for further analysis . Phosphotyrosine Immunoblot Analysis . Cells were extracted in lysis buffer [ 50 m M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 1 % NP40 , 0 . 25 % sodium deoxy - cholate , 150 m M NaCl , 1 m M EDTA , 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 (cid:1) g / ml aprotinin , 1 (cid:1) g / ml leupeptin , 1 (cid:1) g / ml pepstatin , 2 m M Na 3 VO 4 , and 1 m M NaF ] . The extracts were centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C . The clarified supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 5 (cid:1) g of polyclonal cor - tactin antisera ( 14 ) . The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS - PAGE ( 7 . 5 % , w / v ) , transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane , and further blotted with a monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody ( 4G10 ) . To measure the expression levels of cortactin , the blot membrane was stripped and reblotted with mono - clonal cortactin antibody ( 4F11 ) . Cell Growth Assay . MDA - MB - 231 cells were seeded on day 0 in a 12 - well plate at a density of 0 . 4 (cid:2) 10 5 cells / well in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 (cid:2) antibiotic - antimycotic solution ( Life Technologies , Inc . ) . At various times from days 1 – 6 , cells were trypsinized and counted with a hemocytometer under a phase - contrast light microscope . Quadrupled samples were analyzed for each time point . Colony Formation Assay . Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in DMEM plus 10 % FBS . The suspended cells ( 500 ) were mixed with 1 ml of 0 . 4 % top agarose ( SeaPlaque ; FMC BioProducts , Rockland , ME ) in DMEM plus 10 % FBS . The mixture was plated onto a 35 - mm Petri dish containing 1 ml of 0 . 6 % bottom agarose in the same culture medium and incubated at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 . After 2 weeks , colonies were examined under a fluorescence micro - scope ( Olympus 70 - S1F2 ) equipped with a RT Slider digital camera ( Diag - nostic Instruments , Inc . ) . To count the colonies , each dish was divided into 18 zones with a marker , and the cell image in each zone was captured by the digital camera . The colonies with diameters of (cid:3) 100 (cid:1) m were counted and averaged based on the 18 images . For each cell line , four independent dishes were examined . Tumorigenicity of MDA - MB - 231 Cells in the Mammary Fat Pad of Nude Mice . All animal studies described here were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Holland Laboratory . Tumorigenicity of MDA - 231 cells was determined based on a modified method ( 16 ) . Briefly , cells ( 2 (cid:2) 10 6 ) were suspended in 0 . 2 ml of 50 % ( v / v ) Matrigel ( Collaborative Research , Bedford , MA ) in PBS . Four - week - old female nude mice were anesthetized with ketamine ( 30 (cid:1) g / g ) and xylazine ( 1 . 5 (cid:1) g / g ) . The mammary fat pad of a mouse was exposed by a skin incision in the right lateral thorax , and the cells were inoculated into the tissue using a 23 - gauge needle . For each cell sample , eight mice were analyzed . Four weeks after injection , the animals were sacrificed , and the tumors were removed and weighed . Analysis of Adhesion of MDA - MB - 231 Cells to Human BMECs . The procedure was based on a modified method , as described in Ref . 17 . Briefly , human BMECs were plated on fibronectin - coated 2 - well Lab - Tek chamber slides ( Nunc , Inc . , Naperville , IL ) at a density of 2 (cid:2) 10 5 cells / well . After cells were confluent , MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing GFP - cortactin variants were trypsinized , resuspended in DMEM containing 0 . 1 % BSA and 1 m M CaCl 2 , , and plated over monolayers of endothelial cells that had been washed twice with PBS immediately before plating . The cells were incubated at 37°C for 4 h in a CO 2 incubator . Nonattached cells were removed by three washings with PBS . Attached cells were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde for 30 min . Cells that adhered to endothelial cells were inspected under a fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera and quantified by counting the number of green cells based on five high - power field digital images taken randomly at (cid:2) 200 . The average number of adherent cells and the SD were calculated based on three independent experiments . Analysis of Transendothelial Invasion by Tumor Cells . Transendothelial invasion of MDA - MB - 231 cells was analyzed based on a modified method , as described in Ref . 18 . Briefly , human BMECs ( 3 (cid:2) 10 5 ) were plated on a fibronectin - coated polycarbonate membrane insert ( 6 . 5 mm in diameter with 8 . 0 - (cid:1) m pores ) in a Transwell apparatus ( Costar , Cambridge , MA ) and main - tained in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium containing 20 % FBS , 1 (cid:2) antibiotic - antimycotic solution , and 2 m M L - glutamine . After cells reached confluence , MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing GFP - cortactin variants were trypsinized and resuspended in DMEM containing 10 % FBS . The suspended cells ( 3 (cid:2) 10 4 ) were seeded on the monolayer of endothelial cells and incubated for 20 h at 37°C in a CO 2 incubator . After incubation , the insert was washed with PBS . The cells on the top surface of the insert were removed by wiping with a cotton swab . The cells that migrated to the bottom surface of the insert were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde and subjected to fluorescence microscopic inspection . Green cells were counted based on five high - power field digital images taken randomly at (cid:2) 200 . The average number cell number and SD were calculated based on duplicated experiments . Intracardiac Injections of MDA - MB - 231 Cells in Nude Mice . Subcon - fluent MDA - MB - 231 cells were fed with DMEM containing 10 % FBS 24 h before injection . The cells were trypsinized , immediately suspended in DMEM containing 0 . 2 mg / ml soybean trypsin inhibitor , and washed twice with PBS . The washed cells were finally resuspended in cold PBS at a density of 2 . 5 (cid:2) 10 6 cells / ml on ice . Female 4 – 5 - week - old BALB / c - nu / nu mice ( Na - tional Cancer Institute , Frederick , MD ) were anesthetized with ketamine ( 30 (cid:1) g / g ) and xylazine ( 1 . 5 (cid:1) g / g ) . The suspended cells ( 5 (cid:2) 10 5 ) were injected Fig . 1 . Analysis of the expression of GFP - cortactin proteins in MDA - MB - 231 cells . MDA - MB - 231 cells were infected with viruses encoding GFP - cortactin , GFP - Cort F421F466F482 , and GFP . In - fected cells were treated with 100 (cid:1) M pervanadate ( 100 (cid:1) M hydrogen peroxide and 100 (cid:1) M sodium vanadate ) for 1 h . The cells were lysed , immuno - precipitated with polyclonal cortactin antibody , and further immunoblotted with a monoclonal phos - photyrosine antibody ( 4G10 ) . The same blot was stripped and reprobed with a monoclonal cortactin antibody ( 4F11 ) .

The cell - injected animals were housed in a pathogen - free environment for 5 – 10 weeks . Body weights of animals were measured using a digital Sartorius weigher ( The Scale People , Inc . , Beltsville , MD ) . Experiments were repeated twice , and each experiment involved five animals per cell sample . Statistical Analysis . Statistical evaluation of the differences among groups was performed by Mann - Whitney test using GraphPad InStat software . All data shown were the mean (cid:4) SD . Determination of Bone Metastases by X - radiography . Tumors in bone were examined by X - ray radiographs 5 weeks after injection . Animals were anesthetized and placed on a transparent board in prone and lateral positions . The board was placed against an X - ray film ( 22 (cid:2) 27 mm ; X - OMAT AR ; Kodak , Rochester , NY ) and exposed to X - ray at 30 kV for 10 s in a Fixitron radiographic inspection unit ( model 43855A ) . Exposed films were developed using an automatic film processor ( Kodak RP X - OMAT ) . Radiographs of bones were evaluated for the presence of tumor foci . Histological Examinations . Animals were sacrificed with CO 2 . The lung , heart , liver , kidney , spleen , pancreas , forelimbs , and hind limbs were incised and fixed with 10 % formalin . The bone tissues were decalcified in Cal - Ex II solution ( Fisher Scientific ) for 24 h . All tissues were embedded in paraffin . Histological sections were prepared by standard conventional processing and stained with H & E . Micrographs were taken with a Nikon microscope equipped with a digital camera ( Cool Snap ) and further processed using Adobe Photo - shop software . RESULTS Preparation of MDA - MB - 231 Cells Infected with Retrovirus Carrying GFP - cortactin Variants . To examine the role of cortactin in tumor progression , wild - type cortactin and a tyrosine phosphory - lation - deficient cortactin mutant ( 19 ) were tagged at their NH 2 termini by GFP in retroviral vector MGIN as described previously ( 12 ) , yielding fusion proteins GFP - cortactin and GFP - Cort F421F466F482 , respectively . The viruses carrying GFP - cortactin and GFP - Cort F421F466F482 were used to infect MDA - MB - 231 cells . The in - fected cells were further enriched up to 85 % by FACS based on the expression of GFP . Expression of GFP - cortactin proteins was further quantified by immunoblot analysis . As shown in Fig . 1 , both GFP - cortactin and GFP - Cort F421F466F482 were expressed at a level nearly 2 - fold higher than endogenous cortactin . The epitope GFP did not seem to affect the specificity of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin because GFP - cortactin , but not GFP - Cort F421F466F482 , was able to be phosphorylated in response to a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and sodium vanadate ( Fig . 1 ) . A similar response was also described with either endogenous cortactin or small epitopes such as Myc - tagged cortactin proteins ( 19 ) . Overexpression of GFP - Cortactin Variants Did Not Affect the Growth of Breast Cancer Cells . To study the effect of cortactin on cell proliferation , the growth of MDA - MB - 231 cells infected with GFP - cortactin viruses in either normal culture medium , soft agarose , or the mammary fat pad of nude mice was evaluated . None of these assays detected any significant differences among cells expressing GFP - cortactin , GFP - Cort F421F466F482 , and GFP only ( Fig . 2 , A – C ) , indicating that cortactin and its tyrosine phosphorylation - deficient mutant have no significant effects on cell growth . Overexpression of GFP - cortactin Potentiates Bone Metastases . MDA - MB - 231 cells infected with GFP - cortactin variants were also evaluated for their metastatic ability by an experimental bone metas - tasis assay involving injection of the cells into the left cardiac ven - tricles of nude mice ( 20 ) . Five weeks after injection , the animals bearing GFP - cortactin cells developed apparent cachexia ( loss of muscle , fat , and body weight ) . These animals had an average body weight that was 25 % less than that of control animals injected with cells expressing the viral vector only ( Fig . 3 A ) . In contrast , the average body weight of mice bearing GFP - Cort F421F466F482 was about 20 % higher than that of the control animals . The tumors that had metastasized into bone tissues were examined by X - ray radiography , which revealed tumor - induced bone lesions as radiolucent foci ( Fig . 3 C ) . As summarized in Fig . 3 B , the mice bearing GFP - cortactin cells developed an average of 7 tumors / animal , whereas the mice bearing GFP only developed an average of (cid:5) 4 Fig . 2 . Analysis of the effect of cortactin on the growth of MDA - MB - 231 cells . A , MDA - MB - 231 cells infected with cortactin viruses were plated on a 12 - well plate at a density of 0 . 4 (cid:2) 10 5 cells / well in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS . On days 1 – 6 , cells were harvested and counted with a hemocytometer . The data represent the mean of four independent experiments . B , MDA - MB - 231 cells were mixed with 0 . 4 % soft agarose and plated on 35 - mm dishes at a density of 500 cells / dish . After 14 days of incubation , colonies that developed in the soft agarose with sizes of (cid:3) 100 (cid:1) m in diameter were counted . Bars , SD ( n (cid:6) 4 ) . C , cells ( 2 (cid:2) 10 6 ) suspended in a mixture of PBS and Matrigel ( 1 : 1 ) were injected into the mammary fat pad of nude mice ( 8 mice / cell sample ) . Four weeks after injection , the tumors were removed and weighed . Bars , SD ( n (cid:6) 8 ) . No significant differences were detected among the groups by Mann - Whitney test . 6908 OVEREXPRESSION OF CORTACTIN INDUCES METASTASIS on April 13 , 2017 . © 2001 American Association for Cancer Research . cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from tumors / animal . In contrast , the mice injected with GFP - Cort F421F466F482 cells showed much less potential for bone metastasis and developed only 1 tumor / animal . This result is consistent with our previous finding that the mutant acts in a dominant negative manner within cells ( 12 ) . Tumors grown in other tissues were also examined by histological analysis . Most tumor metastases were found within bone tissues , a few in were found in the lung , and one was found in the adrenal gland ( Table 1 ) . No tumors were found in the heart , kidney , spleen , liver , and pancreas . Overexpression of GFP - cortactin Variants Modulates Transen - dothelial Invasion of MDA - MB - 231 Cells . We also attempted to examine whether the enhancement of tumor metastases manifested by overexpression of cortactin could be attributable to an increase in invasion through endothelial cells ( 21 ) . Tumor cells were placed on the monolayer of human BMECs grown in the top chamber of Transwell , a modified Boyden chamber apparatus . After 20 h , the cells that had migrated through the membrane on the bottom chamber were examined by fluorescence microscopy . As shown in Fig . 4 A , GFP - cortactin cells exhibited a motility 70 % higher than that of the control cells , whereas the motility of GFP - Cort F421F466F482 cells was 45 % lower than that of the control cells ( Fig . 4 A ) . The apparent cortactin - induced increase in transendothelial inva - sion could be the result of an increase in the adhesion of tumor cells to endothelial cells . The adhesive abilities of tumor cells were eval - uated by measuring the number of cells that were able to attach to the monolayer of human BMECs 4 h after plating . As shown in Fig . 4 B , GFP - cortactin cells enhanced the adhesive affinity for endothelial cells by (cid:1) 62 % compared with cells expressing the viral vector alone , whereas GFP - Cort F421F466F482 cells adhered to human BMECs with an efficiency that was 40 % lower than that of the control cells . DISCUSSION Metastasis is a multistage process and requires tumor cell invasion into lymphatic and blood circulation systems , adhesion to endothe - lium , transendothelial invasion and migration , and , finally , coloniza - tion in distant tissues ( 22 ) . Whereas the detailed molecular mechanism for each process remains unclear , tumor invasion requires the forma - tion of protrusions projected from the membrane surface of tumor cells ( 23 ) . These pseudopods , which are also called invadopodia ( 24 ) , may facilitate either the action of proteinases for the degradation of extracellular matrix around the tumors or the penetration of cells into Fig . 3 . Analysis of bone metastases of MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing GFP - cortactin proteins . MDA - MB - 231 cells infected with cortactin viruses were injected into the left cardiac ventricles of nude mice as described in “Materials and Methods . ” The experiment was repeated twice . In each experiment , five animals were analyzed for each cell sample . At 5 weeks after injection , the body weights of the mice were measured ( A ) and further examined by X - ray radiograph ( B ) . Bars , SD ( n (cid:6) 10 ) . C , representative radiography for each group . The bone lesions at the joints between the femurs and tibiae ( in high magnification ) are indicated by arrows in the bottom panels . Table 1 The frequency of metastasis of MDA - MB - 231 cells into the organs of mice The internal organs of the mice infected with GFP - cortactin virus were incised and fixed . The resulting paraffin sections were examined for the presence of tumor cells . The data were compiled from 10 animals in each group .

Thus , a molecule that is implicated in the formation of cellular protrusions and cell adhesion to endothelial cells would likely be a good candidate for playing a role in metastasis . This study provides the first evidence that cortactin , a cell protrusion - associated protein , is able to enhance tumor metastasis in vivo . Overexpression of wild - type cortactin in MDA - MB - 231 cells significantly enhanced the frequency of bone metastasis in nude mice ( Fig . 3 ) . This result was consistent with reports that overexpression of cortactin via gene amplification is often associated with poor prognosis of cancer patients ( 9 , 25 ) . Cortactin could play a role in early stages of tumor progression because its phosphorylation level is known to be up - regulated by oncogenes and growth factors ( 26 , 27 ) . However , cells overexpressing either wild - type or tyrosine phosphorylation - deficient cortactin vari - ants had a growth rate similar to that of control cells expressing the vector only as analyzed by growth curve , colony formation in soft agarose , and growth in the mammary fat pad ( Fig . 2 ) . This result agrees with our previous finding ( 6 ) that Src ( (cid:7) / (cid:7) ) cells , in which tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is impaired , exhibit a response similar to that of normal cells to fibroblast growth factor for cell growth . Thus , overexpression of cortactin via gene amplification may serve as a pathogenic mechanism in the late stages of tumor devel - opment rather than contribute directly to the primary tumor progres - sion , which is known to involve many genes responsible for cell cycle regulation ( 28 ) . However , the pathological function of cortactin may be implemented in concert with oncogenes that are involved in cell growth . In this regard , it is worth noting that cortactin is frequently coamplified in cancers with cyclin D1 , an important regulator of the cell cycle ( 4 ) . Overexpression of cortactin can increase by 62 – 70 % in transendo - thelial invasion as well as adhesion to endothelial cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Adhesion of tumor cells to endothelial cells is known to be an important step in tumor metastasis and may determine the rate of cell transendothelial invasion ( 29 ) . Indeed , highly metastatic colorectal cancer cells also tend to have higher affinities for endothelial cells than do poorly metastatic cells ( 30 ) . However , the mechanism by which overexpression of cortactin facilitates the interaction of tumor cells with endothelial cells is not clear . It may involve the activation of cell surface proteins implicated in cell adhesions via alteration of the actin cytoskeleton underneath the plasma membrane , which is required for the function of cell - to - cell or cell - to - extracellular matrix interactions ( 31 ) . The actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic structural entity and constantly undergoes assembly or disassembly ( 32 ) . The assem - bled actin filaments can be further cross - linked to form either actin bundles or actin meshwork . Cortactin may alter the cytoskeleton by its ability to promote actin assembly via activation of Arp2 / 3 , a protein complex that plays a vital role in the nucleation of actin assembly ( 13 ) , and to cross - link actin filaments in a reversible manner depend - ent on its tyrosine phosphorylation ( 5 ) . Cortactin also contains a COOH - terminal SH3 domain , which is known to bind to various membrane - associated proteins including ZO1 , a junction - associated protein ( 33 ) . Thus , cortactin may link a cell adhesion molecule either directly or indirectly via its SH3 domain .
