Pollard 1 , 2 * We used fluorescence microscopy to measure global and local concentrations of 28 cytoskeletal and signaling proteins fused to yellow fluorescent protein ( YFP ) in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Native promoters controlled the expression of these functional YFP fusion proteins . Fluores - cence measured by microscopy or flow cytometry was directly proportional to protein concentration measured by quantitative immunoblotting . Global cytoplasmic concentrations ranged from 0 . 04 ( formin Cdc12p ) to 63 micro - molar ( actin ) . Proteins concentrated up to 100 times in contractile rings and 7500 times in spindle pole bodies at certain times in the cell cycle . This approach can be used to measure the global and local concentrations of any fusion protein . To understand any complicated cellular pro - cess , one must know the global and local concentrations of the participating proteins . Concentrations reveal stoichiometries and are prerequisites for mathematical modeling of bio - logical systems . Unfortunately , concentration measurements are rarely available . In the case of cytokinesis , only one estimate of the concen - tration of myosin - II in the cleavage furrow is available ( 1 ) . Antibodies can be used to estimate the cellular abundance of a few native proteins ( 2 ) or thousands of proteins carrying molecular tags ( 3 ) but not their local concentrations . Light microscopy of cells expressing proteins with a fluorescent tag is an attractive approach , but previous calibration methods depended on assumptions that are difficult to verify , such as the assumption that the quantum yield and detection efficiency are the same inside and outside cells ( 4 – 6 ) . Even with careful microsco - py , absolute concentration may be unknown , because a fluorescent fusion protein was expressed from a plasmid along with endoge - nous native protein . Tests to verify the function - ality of the fusion protein are often lacking . Here we show that the fluorescence of functional fluorescent fusion proteins expressed from native promoters is directly proportional to the number of molecules in live cells . This calibration allowed us to measure the global and local concentrations of 28 different cytoskeletal and signaling proteins as the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe goes through the cell cycle . This approach is applicable to a medium - scale analysis of proteins participating in any cellular process , even without genomic integration of the fusion protein . We integrated the coding sequence for monomeric yellow fluorescent protein ( mYFP ) or YFP into the genome of S . pombe at the N or C termini of 27 different proteins , so the fusion proteins were expressed from their en - dogenous promoters ( 7 , 8 ) . We varied the position of mYFP and the size of linker to find functional constructs . We ruled out partial loss of function by observing normal colony for - mation and cellular morphology under both standard and stressful conditions and by ob - serving the lack of synthetic phenotypes when crossed to strains with other mutations ( 9 ) . The abilities of these tagged constructs to function normally suggest that their expression levels are not substantially different from those of the native proteins . We confirmed this by immuno - blotting Arp3p and by microscopy of Myo2p , IQGAP Rng2p , and pombe Cdc15 homology ( PCH ) protein Cdc15p ( fig . S1 ) ( 9 ) . We combined two measurements to deter - mine the fluorescence per fusion - protein mole - cule . First , we collected stacks of confocal sections through whole cells to measure the total and local fluorescence from each strain ( Fig . 1A and fig . S2 ) . For most tagged proteins , the mean fluorescence intensity was constant from cell to cell , with standard deviations from the mean intensity of only 8 to 37 % ( Table 1 ) . Second , we measured the average number of mYFP fusion molecules per cell by quantitative immunoblotting ( Fig . 1B ) . After background subtraction , the mean fluorescence per cell measured microscopically was directly propor - tional ( R 0 0 . 99 ) to the average number of molecules per cell for seven fusion proteins ( Fig . 1C ) . Flow cytometry confirmed the linear relationship between fluorescence and concen - tration for all 27 proteins ( Fig . 1C and fig . S3 ) . The variance was smaller by microscopy , especially for global concentrations G 0 . 5 m M . The total fluorescence of Fim1p – mYFP was the same whether concentrated in patches or dispersed by treating cells with Latrunculin A ( fig . S4 ) , so quenching was not an issue even when proteins were crowded together in the cell . Similarly , the fluorescence of formin Cdc12p and the Unc45 / Crolp / She4p – related ( UCS ) protein Rng3p with triple YFP tags was three times that of single YFP tags . Because of photobleaching and low signal - to - noise ratios , the measured concentrations of low abundance proteins are less accurate than those of abundant proteins ( fig . S3 ) . Knowing the fluorescence per molecule in live cells , we measured the global concen - trations of 20 other proteins tagged with YFP or mYFP from the integrated fluorescence in - tensity of asynchronous cells ( Table 1 ) .

We used this number to cal - culate cytoplasmic concentrations from the total fluorescence . None of the several different YFP - actin constructs could replace the native actin gene , so we expressed N - terminally tagged YFP - actin at low levels from a plasmid , under the control of attenuated 81nmt1 promoter . Cells tolerated YFP - actin and incorporated it into actin patches with capping protein ( 10 ) but not into the contractile ring , likely because formin Cdc12p cannot handle YFP - actin ( Fig . 1D ) . The fluores - cence intensity of YFP - actin expressed from the plasmid varied widely from cell to cell , with the standard deviation ( 0 . 71 m M ) equal to the mean 0 . 78 m M ( Figs . 1D and 2A ) . Quantitative immunoblots gave cytoplasmic actin concentra - tions of 31 . 3 T 1 . 3 m M in minimal medium ( Fig . 1E ) and 63 . 2 m M in rich medium ( fig . S5 ) . Cell size differed by less than 5 % under these conditions . Immunoblots with YFP antibody showed that an average of 1 . 8 % of the actin was tagged with YFP in cells grown on minimal medium ( Fig . 1E ) . To estimate the number of actin molecules in individual cells , we deter - mined the ratio of that cell _ s volume to the average volume of all the cells in the population . Global cytoplasmic concentrations of cyto - kinesis proteins ( Table 1 ) range from 0 . 04 m M formin Cdc12p ( 600 molecules per cell ) to63 . 2 m M actin ( 1 . 43 million molecules per cell ) . The concentration of myosin - II light chain Cdc4p ( 4 . 8 m M ) is 10 - fold higher than that of Myo2p ( 0 . 45 m M ) , which is in keeping with evidence for functions beyond its partnership with myosins ( 11 – 14 ) . Most of the proteins studied are more abundant in S . pombe than in haploid strains of S . cerevisiae ( table S2 ) , in part be - cause of the 1 . 7 - fold higher protein content per cell of S . pombe ( 15 , 16 ) . Most protein concentrations were constant with cell volume , an estimate of position in the cell cycle ( Fig . 2A and fig . S6 ) . This confirms with better resolution previous immuno - blotting measurements on bulk samples of synchronized cells for formin Cdc12p ( 17 ) , both types of myosin - II heavy chain ( 18 ) , and polo kinase Plo1p ( 19 ) . One exception is the anillin - like protein , Mid2p , which is only de - tected during septation and cell separation ( fig . S6E ) , as reported ( 20 ) . The concentra - tions of anillin - like protein Mid1p and PCH protein Cdc15p are constant across the cell cycle , in spite of fluctuations in mRNA levels ( 19 , 21 – 23 ) , so the ratios of these mRNAs to their proteins vary over time . The biochemical reactions depend on local concentrations , so we used fluorescence and our standard curve ( Fig . 1C ) to measure local con - centrations . Actin patches concentrate at cell poles and at the cell - division site where the cell wall grows ( Fig . 2B ) . The molecular composi - tion of each patch varies over its 20 - s lifetime ( 24 ) as it forms , matures , and dissociates ( 24 , 25 ) , so measurements on patches with random ages vary considerably ( Fig . 2B and Table 1 ; standard deviations 38 to 62 % of means ) . Assuming that the ratio of YFP - actin to native actin is at least as high in patches as the cell as a whole and assuming that patches are spheres 250 nm in diameter ( 26 ) , an average patch has at least 2700 actin molecules ( minimal local concen - Table 1 .

Patches also contain 202 Arp2 / 3 complexes ( 40 m M ; with 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 stoichiometry of 5 subunits ) , 90 capping proteins Acp2p ( 18 m M ) , and a remarkable number , 507 , of the actin filament crosslinker fimbrin Fim1p ( 100 m M ) . The fractions of each protein in patches range from 6 to 21 % ( Table 1 ) . Assuming that each Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates an actin filament as a branch on an older filament , the filaments in patches consist of at least 13 subunits ( Q 30 - nm - long ) and half are capped . This minimum length is similar to that of filaments of 20 subunits in patches isolated from S . cerevisiae ( 27 , 28 ) . Spindle pole bodies ( SPBs ) have both stable and transient components ( Table 1 and Fig . 2C ) that organize microtubules for mitosis and regulate cytokinesis ( 29 , 30 ) . These plaque - like oblate ellipsoids are 0 . 18 m m in diameter and 0 . 09 m m thick ( 0 . 05 m m early in mitosis ) ( 31 ) . Throughout the cell cycle , about 30 % of Sad1p ( an SPB marker protein ) concentrates up to 7500 - fold in SPBs relative to the global cytoplasmic concentration . When mature SPBs separate early in mitosis , the È 1000 molecules of Sad1p divide equally between the two daughter SPBs , which then recruit È 5 mole - cules of Sad1p each minute as the cell cycle progresses ( Fig . 2C ) . Early in mitosis , 6 % of polo kinase Plo1p ( 220 molecules per SPB ) concentrates transiently on both SPBs and , to a lesser extent , in the mitotic spindle to trigger the septation initiation network ( SIN ) ( 30 ) . About 10 min later , the SIN pathway kinase Cdc7p starts to accumulate at È 10 molecules per minute in the new SPB ( 32 ) , peaks at È 440 molecules late in anaphase , and then drops to undetectable levels ( Fig . 2C ) . Thus , the signal from Plo1p is only amplified by a factor of two in terms of accumulation of Cdc7p , the first kinase downstream from the guanosine tri - phosphatase Spg1p in the SIN pathway , and most of both Plo1p and Cdc7p are free to function throughout the cytoplasm . Fluores - cence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments also show dynamic association of other SIN pathway components , Spg1p and Sid2p kinase , with SPBs ( 33 ) . Fission yeast begin cytokinesis when anillin - like Mid1p exits from the nucleus and ini - tiates assembly of at least seven proteins in a broad band of 50 to 120 dots at the cleavage site ( Fig . 3A ) ( 34 ) . Given È 75 dots , each would have about 21 molecules of Mid1p , 43 myosin - II heavy chains Myo2p , 35 myosin regulatory light chains Rlc1p , a vast excess of 289 myosin light chains Cdc4p , 23 IQGAP Rng2p , 22 Cdc15p proteins , and only 2 Cdc12p formin dimers . Thus the stoichiometry of Mid1p to dimeric myosin - II molecules to IQGAP to Cdc15 is close to 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 . Formin homodimers nucleate and remain attached to the barbed end of elongating actin filaments ( 35 ) . Thus each dot could grow about 2 actin filaments anchored by Cdc12p , sufficient for myosin - II to pull the dots together into a continuous contractile ring early in mitosis . The numbers of both Cdc4p and Cdc15p in dots exceed their known binding partners included in this study E myosin - II heavy chain Myo2p and IQGAP Rng2p ( 13 , 14 ) , and Cdc12p ( 36 ) ^ by a factor of 10 , consistent with evidence for other binding partners ( myosins - V and - I ) and functions . Our measurements provide the first quanti - tative inventory of contractile ring proteins . Given a circumference of 10 . 3 m m and about 20 actin filaments in a cross section estimated from published electron micrographs ( 37 ) , an un - contracted actin ring has È 206 m m of filaments consisting of È 76 , 000 subunits ( given 370 actin subunits per micrometer of filament ) , which implies a local actin concentration of È 460 m M . If each of the 150 Cdc12p dimers in a mature contractile ring nucleates an actin filament , an average filament is È 1 . 4 m m long . A mature contractile ring includes È 2900 mol - ecules of Myo2p ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) , enough for 14 myosin heavy chains ( È one myosin - II mini - filament ) per micrometer of actin filament . When activated by the UCS protein Rng3p , myosin - II moves actin filaments at 0 . 5 m m / s ( 14 ) . If the actin filaments are about 1 m m long , a minimum of 3 or 4 sarcomere - like con - tractile units would encircle the equator and constrict the circumference of an unloaded contractile ring at È 3 to 4 m m / s , which is È 10 3 times faster than observed . More likely , the number of contractile units in series is 9 4 , increasing the maximum rate of contraction . If all the myosin - II heads in such a contractile unit were active , they would produce È 1500 pN of force . Thus , either the load is consid - M o l e c u l e s a t d i v i s i on s i t e ( X 1 , 000 ) C B Ain1p Myo2p Cdc15p C on c en t r a t i on a t d i v i s i on s i t e ( µ M ) 5 4 3 2 1 0 30 24 18 12 6 0 5 4 3 2 1 0 10 8 6 4 2 0 Spn1p 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Mid1p Rlc1p Myo2p Rng2p Cdc12p - 20 0 20 40 60 80 Cdc15pCdc4p 450 390 320 260 190 130 64 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Ain1pRgf1p Rgf3pMyp2p Spn1p Spn4pPck2p Chs2p - 20 0 20 40 60 80 D Time ( minutes ) Time ( minutes ) A I II III IV Stage I II III IV - 10 2 10 36 90 min - 10 2 10 36 90 min Time 0 20 40 60 80 min Time StageTime Time 0 20 40 60 80 min Myo2p Cdc12p Ain1pRgf3pMyp2p Spn1p Cdc4p Cdc15p Fig . 3 .

The ratio of one Rng3p per 50 myosin - II heads in the contractile ring ( Table 1 and fig . S7 ) sup - ports the latter hypothesis . In the temperature - sensitive myo2 - E1 mutant , the concentration of Rng3p is higher by threefold globally and È 60 - fold in the contractile ring , perhaps to compensate for the minimal motor activity of this mutant ( 14 ) . Large pools of most contractile - ring proteins remain in the cyto - plasm during cytokinesis ( Table 1 ) available for exchange with assembled rings , as ob - served in FRAP experiments ( 38 , 39 ) . The number of conventional myosin - II ( Myo2p , Cdc4p , and Rlc1p ) molecules in con - tractile rings is roughly constant from the time that a ring condenses through constriction ( Fig . 3 ) , so the local myosin concentration and force - producing capacity increase dramatical - ly as the diameter of the ring declines . Cdc15p not only participates in ring assembly , but its number of molecules increases È 10 - fold as rings mature during anaphase in preparations for septum formation . As rings constrict , the local concentrations of actin - binding proteins IQGAP Rng2p , Cdc15p , formin Cdc12p , and alpha - actinin Ain1p are nearly constant , so all are lost in proportion to the decline in the volume of ring . Septins Spn1p and Spn4p arrive late at the division site , forming rings with 15 to 22 m M septin that do not constrict as the septum forms ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . If used with caution , microscopy with fluorescent fusion proteins provides a precision measuring tool for quantitative biology . Our calibration method can be used to determine the concentration of any protein in yeast or other organisms with homologous recom - bination . Episomal expression of a YFP - fusion protein with measurement of the ratio of tagged and untagged proteins can be used where ho - mologous gene replacement is impossible . References and Notes 1 .

Carruba 1 , 2 Calorie restriction extends life span in organisms ranging from yeast to mam - mals . Here , we report that calorie restriction for either 3 or 12 months induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) expression and 3 ¶ , 5 ¶ - cyclic guanosine monophosphate formation in various tissues of male mice . This was accom - panied by mitochondrial biogenesis , with increased oxygen consumption and adenosine triphosphate production , and an enhanced expression of sirtuin 1 . These effects were strongly attenuated in eNOS null - mutant mice . Thus , nitric oxide plays a fundamental role in the processes induced by calorie restriction and may be involved in the extension of life span in mammals . Calorie restriction ( CR ) extends life span in numerous organisms from yeast ( 1 ) to rodents and possibly primates ( 2 ) . In mammals , CR delays the onset of age - associated diseases in - cluding cancer , atherosclerosis , and diabetes ( 3 ) . A decrease in oxidative damage has been proposed as a mechanism ( 4 ) ; however , a lack of correlation between reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production and life span was recently reported in Drosophila ( 5 ) . Furthermore , in - creasingevidencesuggeststhatSIRT1 , themam - malian ortholog of the SIR2 gene that mediates the life - extending effect of CR in yeast ( 1 , 6 ) , is a key regulator of cell defenses and survival in mammals in response to stress ( 7 ) .
