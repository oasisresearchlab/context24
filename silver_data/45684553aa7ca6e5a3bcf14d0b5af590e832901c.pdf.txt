Both enforced expression of miR - 338 - 3p and small interfering RNA induced Rab14 - mediated accumulation of N - cadherin in the cell - cell junctions or Hhat - associated matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) degradation , which may underline the metastasis defects caused by loss of miR - 338 - 3p in GC . Conclusion : These data indicate that miR - 338 - 3p functions as a tumor suppressor in GC , and that the hypermethylation status of its CpG island might be a novel potential strategy for treating GC . Introduction Gastric cancer ( GC ) is one of the most frequent malignancies and is a leading cause of cancer - related death worldwide [ 1 ] . Aberrant expressions of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) that lead to tumorigenesis or have tumor - suppressing effects have been well studied in GC progression over the past decade [ 2 ] . Moreover , recent studies have identified that epigenetic alteration ( i . e . , DNA methylation ) could play a critical role in the regulation of miRNA expression in GC . For example , hypermethylation - silenced miR - 129 expression has been found to be associated with poor clinical outcome in GC . Moreover , restoration of miR - 129 decreases the expression of its target gene , SRY - related high - mobility group box 4 ( SOX4 ) and reduces proliferation of cancer cells [ 3 , 4 ] . In another study , miR - 10b was found to be silenced in GC cells due to its heavily methylated promoter CpGs , whereas transfection with precursor miR - 10b into GC cells dramatically decreased the mRNA and protein of the target gene , microtubule - associated protein RP / EB family member 1 ( MAPRE1 ) , and resulted in a significant decrease in colony formation and cell growth rates [ 5 ] . Therefore , DNA methylation plays key roles in controlling the expression of tumor - suppressive miRNAs in the developmental stages of gastric tumors . Our previous studies have demonstrated that miR - 338 - 3p is significantly down - regulated in GC and that could suppress GC progression through the PTEN - AKT axis by targeting P - Rex2a both in vivo and in vitro [ 6 ] . However , the mechanisms of miR - 338 - 3p dysregulation in GC remain largely unclear . The high mortality rate of GC is mainly due to the development of metastases at advanced stages , which means the tumors can spread throughout the stomach and to other organs . Many studies have investigated the genes that drive metastasis . Recent studies have also reported that miRNAs could act as activators or inhibitors by targeting multiple signaling pathways involved in metastasis [ 7 - 9 ] . For instance , miR - 218 was identified as a tumor - suppressing miRNA , which can negatively regulate roundabout guidance receptor 1 ( ROBO1 ) , one of the several slit receptors , thus enhancing Slit / Robo1 signaling when suppressed . Restoration of miR - 218 expression inhibited invasion and metastasis of GC both in vitro and in vivo [ 10 ] . On the contrary , miR - 107 and miR - 199a were found to be frequently up - regulated in metastatic GC tissues . Subsequent research characterized DICER1 and mitogen - activated protein kinase 11 ( MAP3K11 ) as direct targets of miR - 107 [ 11 ] and miR - 199a [ 12 ] , respectively . These results suggest that miR - 107 and miR - 199a are oncogenes that promote GC metastasis and are significantly correlated with clinical progression . In the present study , we discovered that the downregulated expression of miR - 338 - 3p is correlated with the Borrmann Stage , an independent prognostic factor of survival that represents the metastasis ability of gastric cancer cells [ 13 ] . It is well known that miRNAs regulate hundreds of potential genes by binding to the 3’ - untranslated region ( UTR ) of target mRNAs , and we identified Ras - related protein ( Rab - 14 ) and Hedgehog acyltransferase ( HHAT ) as two potential targets of miR - 338 - 3p by using a gene target prediction database ( i . e . , miRanda , PicTar , and TargetScan ) . In this study , we provide evidence that Rab14 - mediated N - cadherin accumulation at cell - cell junctional complexes and Hhat - regulated matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) signaling degradation may underlie the metastasis defect caused by miR - 338 - 3p . In addition , we also found that the hypermethylation of CpGs in the promoter region of miR - 338 - 3p is the main reason for miR - 338 - 3p dysregulation in GC .

Materials and Methods Clinical samples and cell culture Human GC tissues and paired non - tumor gastric tissues ( at least 5 cm away from the tumor edge ) were obtained from patients who received surgical gastric resection at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University ( from 2012 to 2014 ) .

Cell wound - healing assay A wound - healing assay was performed to examine the capacity of cell migration and cell interaction . Briefly , once the cells had grown to 90 % confluence in 12 - well plates , a single scratch wound was generated with a 10 μl disposable pipette tip . The extent of wound closure was measured every 12 hours after wounding for 3 days . Cell invasion assay Cells in serum - free medium with epigenetic reagents or transfection treatment were added to the upper Matrigel Invasion Chamber ( 8 μm ; BD , NJ , USA ) , and the bottom wells were filled with complete medium . The cells were allowed to migrate across the membrane for 48 hours . Following the incubation , cells were removed from the upper surface of the filter by scraping with a cotton swab . The invasive cells that adhered to the bottom of the membrane were stained with 1 % crystal violet . Dual - luciferase system The 3’ - UTR of Rab14 or Hhat containing miR - 338 - 3p - binding sites was inserted between the Sac I and Xho I restriction sites of the pmirGLO Dual - Luciferase miRNA Target Expression Vector ( Promega , WI , USA ) .

The primary antibody N - cadherin ( Cell Signal Technology , MA , USA ) was diluted 1 : 500 in permeabilization / blocking solution and used to stain cells at 4°C overnight . The secondary antibody used was Alexa Fluor 647 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Molecular Probes , OR , USA ) . Cells were co - stained with the nucleic acid dye DAPI to visualize the nuclei . Western blot analysis Total proteins were extracted with RIPA lysis buffer ( Wolsen , China ) from cells harvested 48 hours after transfection and were separated by 10 % SDS polyacrylamide gels . They were then electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Millipore , MD , USA ) .

Data were presented as the mean ± SD and analyzed using the PASW Statistics 18 software ( SPSS , USA ) . Differences between the two groups were calculated with the Student’st - test . A two - tailed value of P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Results miR - 338 - 3p is downregulated and correlated with the Bormann stage in GC In our previous study , we found miR - 338 - 3p was down - regulated in both GC tissues ( 53 paired samples ) and cell lines ( 4 cancer cell lines ) [ 6 ] . To further investigate the role of miR - 338 - 3p from a clinical perspective , the association between miR - 338 - 3p expression and clinicopathological factors was analyzed . Among the 20 paired informative samples , which contained the pathological files of depth of invasion ( T ) , lymph node metastasis ( N ) , hematogenous metastasis ( M ) , Bormann stage , and differentiation , the decreased expression of miR - 338 - 3p was found to be significantly associated with the Borrmann stage ( Fig . 1A ) . Although we found that miR - 338 - 3p could suppress cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis , this finding led us to investigate the potential effect of miR - 338 - 3p in GC on cell metastasis . Epigenetic silencing of miR - 338 - 3p in GC BGC - 823 cells As tumor - suppressor genes are frequently inactivated via an epigenetic mechanism , we investigated whether DNA demethylation regulated miR - 338 - 3p expression . To assess the potential methylation status of the promoter region of miR - 338 - 3p , we examined the methylation sites of CpG islands in 5’ - Aza - dC treated cells and untreated cells by using bisulfite sequencing analysis with genomic DNA ( Fig . 1B ) . The second CpG island in the miR - 338 - 3p promoter region was found to be demethylated after 5’ - Aza - dC treatment with a decrease from 97 . 4 % to 71 . 5 % ( Fig . 1C and 1D ) , which was paralleled by the restoration of miR - 338 - 3p expression , a result that has been previously described in a study that indicated that hyper - methylation is the main cause of miR - 338 - 3p depression . miR - 338 - 3p suppresses metastasis of GC BGC - 823 cells Based on the association between miR - 338 - 3p expression and clinical features , we investigated the effects of miR - 338 - 3p on the metastasis features of migration and invasion in GC cells . By using the two major methods available ( Transwell assay and wound - healing assay ) , transfection with miR - 338 - 3p reduced the number of migrated cells by more than 50 % ( Fig . 2A ) . Moreover , compared with the control , miR - 338 - 3p significantly blocked wound healing of BGC - 823 cells ( Fig . 2B ) . Moreover , as mentioned above , the downregulation of miR - 338 - 3p depends on epigenetic silencing , particularly DNA methylation . Treatment with 5’ - Aza - dC restored the expression of miR - 338 - 3p ( Fig . 3A ) . Here , we also detected the effect on metastasis after 5’ - Aza - dC treatment . As expected , 5’ - Aza - dC treatment impeded cell metastasis ( Fig . 3B and 3C ) , which was consistent with the increased expression of miR - 338 - 3p . These results supported the hypothesis that miR - 338 - 3p could contribute to suppression of metastasis in GC cells . Rab14 is a direct target of miR - 338 - 3p We searched three bioinformatic databases ( TargetScan , PicTar , and miRanda ) to identify a large number of potential target genes of miR - 338 - 3p . Among these candidates , Rab14 was selected for further analysis . To explore whether Rab14 is the direct target gene of miR - 338 - 3p , a dual - luciferase reporter system including wild - type as well as mutant 3’ - UTR of Rab14 was employed to examine the interaction between miR - 338 - 3p and Rab14 ( Fig . 4A ) . HEK293 cells were co - transfected with miR - 338 - 3p or miR - control and with pmirGLO - Rab14 - 3’ - UTR - wt or pmirGLO - Rab14 - 3’ - UTR - mut . As shown in Fig . 4B , miR - 338 - 3p clearly Cell Physiol Biochem 2018 ; 50 : 411 - 425 DOI : 10 . 1159 / 000494153 Published online : 11 October 2018 416 Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry © 2018 The Author ( s ) .

Karger AG , Basel www . karger . com / cpb Guo et al . : Epigenetic Silence of miR - 338 - 3p and Its Suppression on Cell Metastasis suppressed the firefly luciferase activity of pmirGLO - Rab14 - 3’ - UTR - wt at 48 hours , while the mutant type was unaffected , which suggests that miR - 338 - 3p directly targeted Rab14 . Meanwhile , we also detected a decreased expression level of Rab14 after transfection with miR - 338 - 3p , which shows that miR - 338 - 3p was able to significantly suppress the expression of Rab14 on both mRNA and protein levels ( Fig . 4C ) . In our previously study , Rab14 was proven to be an oncogene in GC [ 14 ] . In this study , we also performed an IHC assay to confirm its over - expression in GC tissues ( Fig . 4D ) . Furthermore , we silenced Rab14 in BGC - 823 cells by RNA interference to confirm that Rab14 is involved in the anti - metastasis effects of miR - 338 - 3p . Rab14 can be specifically knocked down by shRNA ( Fig . 4E ) at the transcription level . Moreover , silencing of Rab14 resulted in suppressed cell metastasis ( Fig . 4F and G ) , which shows the same pattern as enforced miR - Fig . 1 .

Taken together , these findings indicate that miR - 338 - 3p suppresses cell metastasis by targeting Rab14 . N - Cadherin accumulation at cell - cell junctions in Rab14 - silenced cells Rab14 was found to play a crucial role in the regulation of membrane trafficking between the Golgi complex and the endosome [ 15 ] . Together with Rab GDP - GTP exchange factors FAM116 , Rab14 also defined an endocytic recycling pathway needed for ADAM family protease ADAM10 / Kuzbanian protease trafficking , as well as for regulation of cell - cell junctions by decreasing shedding of cell - surface N - cadherin [ 16 ] . Therefore , we also investigated the localization of N - cadherin in this study . A defined cell - cell junction staining of N - cadherin was clearly visible after transfection with miR - 338 - 3p in comparison with the control cells ( Fig . 5A ) . Moreover , RNA interference silencing of Rab14 also enriched the amount of N - cadherin at cell junctions ( Fig . 5B ) . These results suggest that the elevated levels of N - cadherin at the cell - surface and increased cell - cell junction formation are the causes of the migration defect in Rab14 - silenced cells , which is consistent with previous reports [ 16 ] .

In this study , from bioinformatics databases , we identified a metastasis - related target gene with a well - matched 3’ - UTR , Hhat , which has been proven to promote metastasis and lymphangiogenesis in GC [ 17 ] . To validate this hypothesis , we employed a dual - luciferase reporter system as mentioned above ( Fig . 6A ) , which resulted in an assured interaction between miR - 338 - 3p and Hhat ( Fig . 6B ) . Additionally , we found it was inversely correlated with miR - 338 - 3p ( Fig . 6C ) . To test the effect of Hhat on cell metastasis , we used shRNA to knockdown its expression in BGC - 823 cells ( Fig . 6D ) , which resulted in a considerable decrease in wound - healing capacity ( Fig . 6E ) and cell migration ( Fig . 6F ) . After carrying out a literature review , we subsequently examined whether MMP was involved in Hhat - mediated cell metastasis regulation . Western blots showed that both MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 expression were completely abolished by the inhibition of Hhat with miR - 338 - 3p and shRNA ( Fig . 6G ) , which is in accordance with the results of a previous study on liver cancer cells [ 18 ] . Taken together , these findings suggest that miR - 338 - 3p could inhibit cell metastasis through Hhat - mediated MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 in GC cells . Fig . 3 .

However , few studies have focused on the regulation of miR - 338 - 3p expression , and the mechanism of miR - 338 - 3p regulation has remained unclear until now . Previous studies have demonstrated that the silencing of primary transcripts by the CpG island promoter hypermethylation is one of the most common causes for the loss of tumor - suppressor miRNAs in human cancer [ 26 ] . For example , miR - 145 is a well - known tumor suppressor that is down - regulated in many human cancers and which was found to undergo aberrant DNA methylation in its promoter [ 27 ] . Fig . 6 . miR - 338 - 3p suppresses metastasis by targeting the Hhat - MMP signaling pathway . ( A ) miR - 338 - 3p is highly conserved across species and binding sites within the seeded region sequence in the 3′ - UTR of human HHAT . ( B ) Luciferase assay in HEK - 293 cells as described above . Luciferase activity in pLUC - HHAT _ WT group denoted a statistically significant decrease following ectopic expression of miR - 338 - 3p . ( C / D ) HHAT mRNA expression level measured by qRT - PCR after transfection with miR - 338 - 3p vector or sh - HHAT . GAPDH was used as a housekeeping control . ( E / F ) Cell invasion and wound healing assays were performed to reveal the suppression of cell metastasis after silencing of HHAT .

Published by S . Karger AG , Basel www . karger . com / cpb Guo et al . : Epigenetic Silence of miR - 338 - 3p and Its Suppression on Cell Metastasis Moreover , miR - 199a is regulated by DNA methylation of the locus from which it is transcribed and the association between this downregulation and the aberrant DNA hypermethylation of its promoter has been described in GC [ 28 ] . Based on our previous study , we found that miR - 338 - 3p expression was downregulated in both GC tissues and cells , and this downregulation is closely associated with hypermethylation in one of its CpG islands at the promoter region , which was also substantiated in Li et al . ’s study using methylation - specific PCR [ 24 ] . The survival and prognosis of GC are poor partly because of relapse and metastasis . In this study , we found that downregulation of miR - 338 - 3p is clinically associated with the Bormann stage . This stage is classified as advanced GC according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association [ 29 ] , mainly based on endoscopic or gross morphologic appearance [ 30 ] . To extend our previous observation , we focused on the role of miR - 338 - 3p in the regulation of migration and invasion , as well as gene expression , in GC . We discovered that enforced expression of miR - 338 - 3p could suppress the migrative and invasive potential of GC cells . Consistently , this suppression also occurred after treatment with 5’ - Aza - dC , accompanied with a restoration of miR - 338 - 3p expression . To understand the possible mechanisms underlying miR - 338 - 3p - mediated suppression of migration and invasion , we used miRanda , PicTar , and TargetScan to predict potential targets of miR - 338 - 3p . We identified Rab14 , the final member of the Rab11 subfamily isolated from migrating cells [ 31 ] . Silencing Rab14 has been shown to result in increased N - cadherin levels at junctional complexes and cannot resolve cell - cell junctions in migrating cells [ 16 ] . The Rab family of small GTPase is highly involved in various aspects of membrane traffic control ; for example , they function as molecular switches regulating vesicular transport in eukaryotic cells [ 32 , 33 ] . Recently , Rab - GTPase - directed endocytic trafficking pathways have begun to emerge as key transport events required for the remodeling of cell adhesion and cellular junctions as well as migration [ 34 , 35 ] . For example , Rab27 has been reported to be involved in exocytosis of endocrine cells and is associated with the invasive and metastatic potential of breast cancer , promoting the secretion of insulin - like growth factor - II [ 36 ] . Another study demonstrated that Rab27b controls vesicle exocytosis and releases important growth regulators into the tumor microenvironment , leading to regulation of invasive growth and metastasis in ER - positive human breast tumors [ 37 ] . In our study , we constructed dual - luciferase reporter systems to verify that Rab14 is targeted by miR - 338 - 3p , and the forced expression of miR - 338 - 3p reduced the expression of Rab14 . Furthermore , we performed RNA interference to knock - down Rab14 , and our findings showed that sh - Rab14 could also significantly inhibit the migration and invasion of GC cells . Subsequently , we used immunofluorescence microscopy to explore the location of N - cadherin and found that both enforced miR - 338 - 3p and sh - Rab14 induced accumulation of N - cadherin at cell - cell junctional complexes , which explained their suppressive role on cell migration and invasion in GC cells . These results demonstrated that miR - 338 - 3p could inhibit GC cell migration and invasion through targeting Rab14 . It is well - known that miRNAs can regulate hundreds of potential targets . We verified that Hhat is targeted by miR - 338 - 3p using dual - luciferase reporter systems and RNA interference in this system . Hhat functions as a palmitoyl acyltransferase with specificity for N - palmitoylation of the Sonic Hedgehog ( SHH ) signaling pathway in COS - 1 cells [ 38 ] . Activation of the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway can promote cell metastasis through the PI3K / AKT pathway , which will lead to MMP - 9 activation in liver cancer [ 18 ] and GC [ 17 ] . The degradation of the basement membrane ( BM ) and the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) are critical events in tumor invasion and metastasis [ 39 ] . MMPs , especially MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 , are the most important enzymes for BM and ECM degradation . Our results showed that both MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 expression decreased in GC cells transfected with miR - 338 - 3p and sh - Hhat , respectively , which indicates that miR - 338 - 3p could also suppress the migration and invasion of GC cells through Hhat - regulated MMP expression .

Functionally , miR - 338 - 3p could inhibit the metastatic feature of GC cells such as migration and invasion in vitro . Moreover , we identified Rab14 - mediated N - cadherin and the Hhat - MMP signaling pathway as key targets of miR - 338 - 3p . These results enhance our understanding of the regulation and functions of miR - 338 - 3p in GC progression and suggest that miR - 338 - 3p could be used as a potential target for miR - based GC therapy .
