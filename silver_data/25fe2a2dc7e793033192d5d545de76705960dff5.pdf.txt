Actin Polymerization Serves as a Membrane Domain Switch in Model Lipid Bilayers Allen P . Liu * and Daniel A . Fletcher * y * Biophysics Program and y Bioengineering Department , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 ABSTRACT The ability of cells to mount localized responses to external or internal stimuli is critically dependent on organization of lipids and proteins in the plasma membrane . Involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in membrane organization has been documented , but an active role for actin networks that directly links internal organization of the cytoskeleton with membrane organization has not yet been identiﬁed . Here we show that branched actin networks formed on model lipid membranes enriched with the lipid second messenger PIP 2 trigger both temporal and spatial rearrangement of membrane components . Using giant unilamellar vesicles able to separate into two coexisting liquid phases , we demonstrate that polymerization of dendritic actin networks on the membrane induces phase separation of initially homogenous vesicles . This switch - like behavior depends only on the PIP 2 - N - WASP link between the membrane and actin network , and we ﬁnd that the presence of a preexisting actin network spatially biases the location of phase separation . These results show that dynamic , membrane - bound actin networks alone can control when and where membrane domains form and may actively contribute to membrane organization during cell signaling . INTRODUCTION Spatial organization of the plasma membrane and associated membrane proteins underlies many important cellular pro - cesses , including cell - cell communication , polarization , and motility ( 1 – 4 ) . For example , formation of the immunological synapse requires clustering of T cell receptors and MHC - peptide at the junction between a T cell and antigen presenting cell ( 5 ) , and antigen - mediated oligomerization of IgE recep - tors in mast cells drives their association with lipid rafts ( 6 ) . Local interaction of lipids or proteins via clustering or olig - omerization has been shown to trigger a cascade of events that affect partitioning of membrane molecules into membrane domains ( 7 – 10 ) . However , a mechanism by which the cell could actively control this partitioning is not well understood , though the cell’s actin cytoskeleton is believed to play an important role ( 6 , 11 ) . The actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic network of ﬁlaments that can rapidly reorganize in response to external or internal stimuli ( 12 , 13 ) . An important role for the actin cytoskeleton in membrane organization is suggested by the observation that signaling from IgE receptors and formation of the immu - nological synapse both require an intact actin cytoskeleton ( 14 – 17 ) . One of the most prominent physical and functional links between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskel - eton is the lipid second messenger phosphatidyl - inositol 4 , 5 bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) through the actin nucleation promoting factor neural Wiscott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) ( 18 , 19 ) . Transient binding of N - WASP by PIP 2 and GTP - bound Cdc42 controls activation of the branching complex Arp2 / 3 , which is responsible for the formation of dendritic actin networks ( 20 ) . We hypothesized that membrane com - ponents linked through the cell’s actin cytoskeleton could inﬂuence global membrane organization , providing a mech - anism through which changes in cytoskeletal organization could directly alter membrane organization . Ternary lipid systems that undergo phase separation into coexisting liquid ordered ( L o ) and liquid disordered ( L d ) domains have served as model systems for investigating membrane organization in recent years ( 21 ) . One advantage of this system is that temperature can be used to reversibly change the thermodynamic state of the membrane without perturbing membrane composition . Phase separation behavior can be quantiﬁed with miscibility transition temperature , denoted as T misc . T misc corresponds to the temperature above which sep - arated phases are homogenized into a single phase . Recently , Hammond et al . ( 22 ) reported that local clustering of GM 1 by the pentameric ligand cholera toxin B ( CTB ) causes a uniform membrane to phase separate into domains . We used a similar in vitro vesicle system to investigate the interplay between mem - brane organization and dynamic actin networks . In our work , formation of a localized actin network on model lipid membranes both induces de novo membrane domain formation and stabilizes existing membrane domains by shifting T misc of the membrane . Furthermore , the presence of an actin network associated with the membrane was found to spatially bias location of membrane domain formation after homogenization . These results suggest that actin polymeri - zation can act as a ‘‘switch’’ for spatial and temporal orga - nization of membrane components . Upon growth of an Arp2 / 3 - branched actin network on PIP 2 - containing vesicles , membrane organization can be reversibly changed from a homogeneous distribution of lipids to a phase - separated membrane .

BODIPY tetra - methylrhodamine 1 , 2 - dipalmitoylphosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 diphosphate , BODIPY tetramethyl rhodamine ( TMR ) PIP 2 , was purchased from Echelon Biosciences ( Salt Lake City , UT ) . Actin was puriﬁed from rabbit acetone dried powder as described by Spudich and Watt ( 23 ) . Rhodamine actin was labeled according to Amann et al . ( 24 ) . His - tagged Rat D EVH1 N - WASP was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and puriﬁed using Nickel afﬁnity chromatography ( 25 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex was puriﬁed from bovine brains ( 26 ) . Protein purities were checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis . Protein concentrations were determined by protein absorbance at 280 nm or 290 nm . N - WASP activity was conﬁrmed by bead motility assay using N - WASP - coated microspheres ( 27 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex activity was conﬁrmed by pyrene actin polymerization assay ( 28 ) . Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin was purchased from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad , CA ) . Giant unilamellar vesicles formation Giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) were grown using the electroformation technique at 60 (cid:3) C ( 29 ) . Our model system consists of a lipid composition of 2 % : 1 % : 30 % : 0 . 6 % DPPC / DOPC / Chol / BODIPY TMR PIP 2 . The ternary lipid system of DPPC / DOPC / Chol at a ratio of 2 % : 1 % : 30 % has been shown to phase separate into L o and L d domains at ; 33 (cid:3) ( 21 ) . A trace amount of either lis - DPPE or ﬂuo - DOPE ( 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 % ) was used as a marker for DOPC - richL d domains . Topreparelipidmixtures , stocklipidsinchloroformareused to make 2 % : 1 % : 30 % : 0 . 6 % mixture of DPPC / DOPC / Chol / BODIPY TMR PIP 2 by mole to yield vesicles that are phase separated at room temperature . Lipid mixture was spread onto an electrically conductive and optically transparent slide coated with indium tin oxide ( ITO ) ( Delta Technologies , Stillwater , MN ) , driedundervacuumfor30minbeforeswellingin350mOsm sucrosesolutionunderalternateelectricﬁeldfor3hinachamberconsistingof two ITO slides spaced between a silicon rubber spacer . Actin - associated vesicles PIP 2 - containing vesicles were incubated with N - WASP for 15 min ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl ) and then were added to a solution of actin and Arp2 / 3 complex . The ﬁnal mixture consists of 6 m M actin , 150 nM Arp2 / 3 complex , 390 nM N - WASP in polymerization buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM ATP , 1 mM dithiothreitol ) with adjusted osmolarity . The sample was loaded into a ﬂow cell consisting of a glass slide and a cover glass spaced between two strips of double - sided tape ; 6 mm apart . To remove membrane - associated actin patches , 0 . 75 mg / ml Proteinase K was added and incubated for 15 min at 37 (cid:3) C . Entangled actin ﬁlaments were found to be stable at temperature up to 50 (cid:3) C based on an analysis of Brownian motion of micron - sized polystyrene beads . Microscopy GUVs were observed by phase contrast and epiﬂuorescence microscopy using a 40 3 objective on an inverted microscope ( Axiovert 200 , Carl Zeiss , Germany ) . Plain vesicles were diluted with glucose solution of equal osmolarity to allow sedimentation and refractive index gradient for contrast enhancement . Temperature of the sample is controlled by a temperature - controlled stage ﬁtted onto the microscope platform ( Instec , Boulder , CO ) , and sample temperature was calibrated with a digital thermometer to within 0 . 2 (cid:3) C . At each temperature , vesicles were viewed in phase contrast and ﬂuorescence microscopy at random locations throughout the chamber , and the number of vesicles that were phase separated was counted . Temperature was ramped at a rate of 2 (cid:3) C / min , and the stage and the sample were allowed to equilibrate to the new temperature for at least 15 min . T misc and its associated standard deviation were obtained by ﬁtting the data points based on 6 – 9 temperatures with n ¼ 30 – 100 to a sigmoidal curve . The standard deviation associated with change in T misc was calculated by using the appro - priate error propagation . Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to image actin network ( labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin ) on the surface of L d membrane ( labeled with ﬂuo - DOPE ) using a 60 3 oil objective ( SP2 - AOBS , Leica , Germany ) . Three - dimensional reconstruction was performed by using VolumeJ , a downloadable plug - in for ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . Confocal images are shown in Supplemental Materials . High resolution scanning electron microscopy was used to image the dense ultrastructure of actin network nucleated from the membrane surface ( Hitachi , Pleasanton , CA ) . The sample was deposited on polylysine - coated silicon substrate , ﬁxed with 2 % glutaraldehyde , permeablized partially with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and postﬁxed with 1 % OsO 4 . The sample was then dried with ethanol dehydration followed by critical point drying using liquid CO 2 . Dried sample was coated with 2 nm of iridium using a high resolution sputter coater ( BAL - TEC , Tuscan , AZ ) . RESULTS Actin networks assemble on PIP 2 - enriched domains GUVs were made by electroformation from a mixture of saturated lipid dipalmitylphosphatidylcholine ( DPPC ) , unsat - urated lipid dioleoylphosphatidylcholine ( DOPC ) , and cho - lesterol ( Chol ) ( see Materials and Methods ) . BODIPY TMR phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 bisphosphate ( TMR - PIP 2 ) was added to stimulate actin network growth , and a trace amount of ﬂuorescent phospholipid probe dioleoylphosphatidylethanol - amine - N - carboxyﬂuorescein ( ﬂuo - DOPE ) or 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl ) ( lis - DPPE ) was added to identify phase separation . On phase - separated vesicles , the puriﬁed proteins N - WASP , Arp2 / 3 complex , and actin formed dendritic actin networks only on the domains enriched in TMR - PIP 2 , creat - ing an actin - associated domain shown schematically in Fig . 1 A . Networks were formed on the outside of vesicles for experimental simplicity . High resolution scanning electron microscopy conﬁrmed that the actin polymerized on the vesicle consisted of a dense network of ﬁlaments with similar spacing to actin networks in lamellipodia ( Fig . 1 B and Supplemental Materials ) . Sufﬁciently dense actin networks can be identiﬁed by phase contrast microscopy and appear dark due to their optical phase density ( Fig . 1 C i ) . The optical phase - dense appearance is consistent with images of the actin - propelled pathogen Listeria monocytogenes ( 30 ) and actin - propelled microspheres coated in nucleation promoting factors ( 31 ) , and it serves as a convenient indicator of actin network growth . Presence of the actin network was further conﬁrmed ﬂuorescently through use of rhodamine actin and ﬂuorescent phalloidin ( see Supplemental Materials Fig . S1 ) . Epiﬂuorescence microscopy of ﬂuo - DOPE ( Fig . 1 C ii ) and TMR - PIP 2 ( Fig . 1 C iii ) showed that TMR - PIP 2 colocalized Phase Separation by Actin Networks 4065 Biophysical Journal 91 ( 11 ) 4064 – 4070 with ﬂuo - DOPE . Fig . 1 C iv shows an overlay of Fig . 1 C i – iii where phase - dense actin has been pseudocolored in blue to show localized growth of actin on the phase - separated vesicle . Based on the smaller fraction of bright phase than dark phase in the vesicle coinciding with the smaller proportion of unsaturated lipid than saturated lipid present in our model system , we believe that ﬂuo - DOPE labels the L d domain , and therefore TMR - PIP 2 partitions to the L d domain . However , the designation of the domain associated with PIP 2 is not central to our results . The spatial organization of PIP 2 in plasma membranes is still under debate ( 32 , 33 ) , and at least one discrepancy in the phase behavior of proteins between model and native membranes has been reported ( 34 ) . In our experiments , phase - separated membranes enriched in TMR - PIP 2 facilitate polymerization of dendritic actin networks on a single domain so that the inﬂuence of an associated actin network on phase behavior can be studied . Miscibility transition temperature increases in actin - associated membrane We ﬁrst examined the effect of a dynamic actin network on membrane domain formation by determining T misc ( Fig . 2 A ) . Phase - separated vesicles with associated actin networks were prepared below T misc , and temperature was increased until the lipids homogenized according to visualization of ﬂuo - DOPE . Since lipid composition of individual vesicles varies slightly during preparation ( 35 ) , we deﬁned T misc as the temperature at which 50 % of vesicles in a population were phase separated by random sampling at each temperature . Vesicles associated with actin networks ( Fig . 2 B , red squares ; n ¼ 30 – 33 ) were found to have T misc that was 7 . 2 (cid:3) C 6 0 . 6 (cid:3) C ( n ¼ 30 – 33 ) higher than in the absence of actin ( Fig . 2 B , black squares ; n ¼ 30 – 100 ) , signifying an increase in the enthalpy of mixing and stabi - lization of existing membrane domains associated with actin . We next examinedtheeffect onphase separationbehavior of actin networks formed on initially homogenized membranes . Vesicles were prepared above T misc and components of the actinnetwork wereadded . Distinctactin patches wereobserved to assemble on membranes that had an initially homogeneous distribution of TMR - PIP 2 . T misc was then quantiﬁed by observ - ing individual vesicles while temperature was decreased . The vesiclesexhibitedanincreasein T misc of6 . 9 (cid:3) C 6 0 . 8 (cid:3) C ( n ¼ 3 ) , the same as actin - associated vesicles that were initially phase separated ( Fig . 2 B , bluesquare ) . We also measured T misc using unlabeled PIP 2 vesicles ( at 6 . 8 % ) and found a similar increase in T misc of 7 . 3 (cid:3) C 6 0 . 7 (cid:3) C ( n ¼ 35 – 40 , Fig . 2 C , bar 2 ) . Interestingly , at 0 . 6 % PIP 2 we found a smaller but signiﬁcant increase in T misc of 4 . 1 (cid:3) C 6 0 . 4 (cid:3) C ( n ¼ 35 – 40 , Fig . 2 C , bar 3 ) , which was consistent with the decreased nucleation activity of unlabeled PIP 2 compared to TMR - PIP 2 ( see Discussion and Supplemental Materials ) . The increase in T misc found with increasing PIP 2 concentrations suggests that the stabilizing effects of vesicle - associated actin networks may increase with the number of linkages between the membrane and actin ; however , the dependence on speciﬁc components in the system and the resulting behavior are expected to be complex . PIP 2 - N - WASP link is necessary for the observed increase in T misc To determine which proteins and lipids were responsible for the observed increase in T misc , we systematically omitted FIGURE 1 Assembly of actin net - works on phase - separated GUVs .

Scale bars are 10 m m . 4066 Liu and Fletcher Biophysical Journal 91 ( 11 ) 4064 – 4070 components of the system and quantiﬁed T misc as before ( Fig . 2 C ) . A mixture without either PIP 2 or N - WASP had little effect on T misc compared to the original ternary lipid vesicles ( bars 4 and 5 ) . Vesicles in polymerized actin ﬁlaments in the absence of Arp2 / 3 complex also behaved similarly , with or without N - WASP ( bars 6 and 7 ) , compared to vesicles without added proteins . To exclude the possibility that N - WASP binding to PIP 2 affects phase transition behavior , we incubated the PIP 2 vesicle with N - WASP but no other components of the actin network and found no change in T misc ( bar 8 ) . Digestion of membrane - associated actin networks by incubation with Proteinase K ( bar 9 ) also resulted in comparable T misc with respect to the original vesicles . Finally , to ensure N - WASP is activated in a physiologically relevant manner through binding to PIP 2 , we found that replacing PIP 2 with charged lipid DOPS in sufﬁcient concentration to achieve the same surface charge as PIP 2 does not alter T misc in the presence of puriﬁed proteins ( bar 10 ) . These experiments demonstrate that the interaction between PIP 2 and N - WASP bound to actin ﬁlaments is necessary and sufﬁcient for altering membrane organization . Actin networks serve as a membrane domain switch The shift in T misc of membrane associated with an actin network relative to membrane not associated with an actin network suggests that actin polymerization can induce formation of membrane domains . To demonstrate this , we held a population of homogeneous vesicles at a temperature slightly above T misc and added the actin network compo - nents , maintaining a constant temperature of 36 (cid:3) C . We observed that 74 . 3 % 6 5 . 1 % ( n ¼ 74 ) of the vesicles were phase separated after addition of actin compared to 38 . 0 % 6 4 . 9 % ( n ¼ 100 ) of vesicles before . This shift , shown by the arrow pointing vertically upward from a black triangle to a red triangle in Fig . 2 B , demonstrates that the associated actin FIGURE 2 Shift in T misc due to membrane - associated actin networks .

T R and T H indicate room temperature and high temperature , respectively . ( B ) T misc increases for GUVs associated with an actin network ( red squares ) compared to those without ( black squares ) . T m and T ma were determined to be 33 . 4 (cid:3) C 6 0 . 5 (cid:3) C and 40 . 6 (cid:3) C 6 0 . 3 (cid:3) C by ﬁtting the data points to a sigmoidal curve ( black and red line ) . When actin was polymerized at T H , T misc of individual vesicles ( n ¼ 3 ) was found to be 40 . 3 (cid:3) C 6 0 . 8 (cid:3) C ( blue square ) by lowering temperature . ( C ) Dependence of T misc shift on model system composition . A substantial increase in T misc was not observed when N - WASP or TMR - PIP 2 were omitted from the model system ( bars 4 and 5 ) , indicating that PIP 2 - N - WASP linked through actin ﬁlaments is responsible for the observed increase in T misc . When the actin network was removed from membrane by incubation with Proteinase K or when TMR - PIP 2 was replaced by DOPS , a substantial increase in T misc was not observed ( bars 9 and 10 ) . However , when TMR - PIP 2 was replaced with unlabeled - PIP 2 , a signiﬁcant increase in T misc was measured ( bars 2 and 3 ) . Phase separation of membrane was determined by lis - DPPE ﬂuorescence for bars 2 , 3 , and 10 , and ﬂuo - DOPE for all other experiments . T misc was determined as in B . Phase Separation by Actin Networks 4067 Biophysical Journal 91 ( 11 ) 4064 – 4070 network had switched the phase behavior of the vesicle population without changes in temperature or membrane composition . To investigate whether a preexisting actin network can spatially direct domain arrangement on membranes , we tracked the formation of membrane domains on individual actin - associated vesicles as they were cycled above and below T misc ( Fig . 3 A ) . Upon lowering temperature to induce phase separation , we found that membrane domains repeatedly reformed at locations that colocalized with actin networks ( n ¼ 6 ) ( Fig . 3 B ) . Bycomparison , vesicleswithoutmembrane - associated actin networks yielded domains in random posi - tions after temperature cycling above and below T misc ( data not shown ) . DISCUSSION Mechanism of domain stabilization The results presented in this work demonstrate that dendritic actin networks associated with model lipid bilayers through a PIP 2 - N - WASP link can both stabilize and induce phase - separated domains . Although changes in T misc have been observed upon cross - linking or oligomerization of lipids , the mechanism of actin - induced phase separation is distinct . Cross - linking a lipid raft component GM 1 by CTB has been shown to increase the T misc of GM 1 - containing vesicles after CTB binding by an average of ; 6 (cid:3) C ( 22 ) . Although sta - bilization of phase - separated domains is also shown in our experiments , membrane components organized by associa - tion with actin must be linked by long - range ( i . e . , nonad - jacent ) connections through the ﬁlament network rather than by local ( i . e . , adjacent ) connections such as through CTB binding . Links between the actin cytoskeleton and PIP 2 have been shown to be important in a number of studies . For example , Kwik et al . ( 36 ) found that organization of cellular actin was dependent on both PIP 2 and cholesterol , a component critical for lipid rafts . Furthermore , force measurements on tethers pulled from cell membrane showed that PIP 2 regulates the adhesionenergy between the membrane and cytoskeleton ( 37 ) . The only component in our simpliﬁed system that is able to bindtoPIP 2 isN - WASP , butbindingofPIP 2 toN - WASPalone was unable to increase T misc ( Fig . 2 C , bar 8 ) . This suggests that the presence of an interconnected actin network is essential for mediating the observed shift in phase behavior . In contrast to ligands that cross - link neighboring molecules on a membrane ( 22 ) , a branched actin network is able to connect distant PIP 2 molecules to stabilize membrane domains . This proposed ‘‘networking’’ mechanism for organizing membrane components is expected to exhibit different be - havior from local cross - linking . For instance , because local cross - links of membrane components , such as CTB - GM 1 , act independently , we would not expect to see a spatial bias - ing of domain reformation when temperature is lowered below T misc on CTB - GM 1 vesicles . In contrast , we do observe spatial biasing in membrane associated with actin networks . This spatial biasing may be explained by a pref - erential localization of PIP 2 - N - WASP with preexisting actin networks that in turn localizes associated lipid molecules in the L d phase . Actin polymerization on model lipid membrane We found that vesicles containing unlabeled PIP 2 exhibit increased T misc when associated with actin networks ( Fig . 2 C , bars 2 and 3 ) , but we chose to use TMR - PIP 2 - containing vesicles for most experiments to enable ﬂuorescence imag - ing of both PIP 2 and DOPE at the same time as phase micros - copy imaging of phase - dense actin networks . The ﬂuorescent group of TMR - PIP 2 is attached to the hydrophobic lipid tail , FIGURE 3 Spatially biased formation of phase - separated domains . ( A ) Illustration of domain reformation at existing membrane - associated actin networks after temperature cycling above and below T misc . ( B ) Optical phase contrast , epiﬂuorescence of ﬂuo - DOPE , and TMR - PIP 2 images of a GUV during temperature cycling above and below T misc . After temperature cycling , ﬂuorescent phase - separated lipid domains reformed at the same location as existing phase - dense membrane - associated actin networks with temperature cycling . Scale bar is 10 m m . 4068 Liu and Fletcher Biophysical Journal 91 ( 11 ) 4064 – 4070 and this modiﬁcation is known to preserve the activity of PIP 2 as shown by ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer experiments in a model system ( 19 ) . We speculate the difference between unlabeled PIP 2 and TMR - PIP 2 lies in their capacity to activate N - WASP . In vivo , N - WASP can be activated through the release of autoinhibitory interactions by binding to coactivators PIP 2 and GTP - bound Cdc42 ( 38 ) . It has previously been found that PIP 2 alone ( in the absence of Cdc42 ) can activate N - WASP activity when reconstituted in small lipid vesicles ( k act ¼ 8 m M ) ( 39 ) . In a cell of 10 m m in diameter , a typical PIP 2 concentration of 1 % has an ef - fective concentration of ; 14 m M on the membrane surface , which is sufﬁcient to activate N - WASP without Cdc42 . We found that in the absence of Cdc42 , vesicles containing 0 . 6 % TMR - PIP 2 could activate N - WASP sufﬁciently to produce actin networks with a density similar to those found in lamellipodia , and the presence of phase - dense dendritic actin networks could be detected within a minute of incubating the vesicles with actin and Arp2 / 3 complex . When unlabeled PIP 2 was used in place of TMR - PIP 2 , rhodamine - labeled actin conﬁrmed that a network was polymerized on the membrane surface , though more slowly and less dense than TMR - PIP 2 - containing vesicles . As a result , we could not easily detect the presence of actin networks on the surface of the vesicles using phase contrast microscopy . How TMR - PIP 2 mechanistically enhances activation of N - WASP com - pared to unlabeled PIP 2 is unclear . It has been suggested that PIP 2 binds to the basic domain of N - WASP in a multi - valent , cooperative manner ( 25 ) . Thus , one possible explanation for the enhanced activity of TMR - PIP 2 could be its ability to cluster due to hydrophobic stacking of the BODIPY - TMR dye , though we note that TMR - PIP 2 alone had no signiﬁcant effect on the miscibility transition temperature . Alterna - tively , the ﬂuorescent group may cause extension of the headgroup , which would facilitate destabilization of inacti - vated N - WASP similar to the combined effect of PIP 2 and Cdc42 in vivo . It is worth noting that at temperatures above T misc , the lipid composition may not be truly homogeneous . It has been shown that domains with dimensions below the optical resolution exist above T misc ( 40 , 41 ) , and it is possible that the spatial biasing of domain formation occurs through coales - cence of small domains into a larger liquid lipid phase . At temperatures above T misc , a slightly heterogeneous distribu - tion of lipids may have a catalytic effect on large - scale phase separation when temperature is lowered . In addition , our model lipid bilayer composition does not accurately match that of the inner surface of the plasma membrane . Since membrane composition is likely to vary between cell types and at different times in the life cycle of the cell , there is no standard way to model composition of the inner leaﬂet of plasma membrane . It remains to be understood how actin networks that stabilize inner membrane lipids could inﬂu - ence organization of outer membrane lipids through trans - bilayer coupling . CONCLUSIONS The plasma membrane of cells is a complex structure that is speciﬁcally organized for a variety of functional purposes . Cytoplasmic linkages to the plasma membrane through the cytoskeleton have been shown to provide barriers to dif - fusion ( 42 , 43 ) , to stabilize signaling events in some cell types ( 6 ) , and to inhibit receptor signaling in other cases ( 44 ) . Our simpliﬁed system , based on reconstitution of actin networks on model lipid bilayers , illustrates a general mech - anism for how cellular membrane components may be organized by a dynamic actin cytoskeleton . In contrast to the view of actin networks as passively restricting diffusion of lipids and proteins in the membrane , we propose that actin polymerization and depolymerization can actively organize membrane domains . By affecting lipid - lipid interactions through cytoskeleton - linked lipid - protein interaction , actin assembly can promote formation of membrane domains and actin disassembly can destabilize them , thus acting as a switch . Since membrane - associated actin networks favor domain formation , additional signaling molecules may be localized during network growth , leading to positive feed - back and ampliﬁcation . Conversely , disassembly of the net - work can lead to homogenization of domain components that erases membrane organization . In addition to the previously demonstrated effects of clustering and oligomerization of membrane components by binding to ligands / antibodies on the extracellular side of the membrane ( 45 ) , our results sug - gest that the actin cytoskeleton can directly inﬂuence mem - brane organization from the cytosolic side . By controlling actin networking at the membrane , it may be possible for the cell to ﬁnely control membrane organization with high spatial and temporal precision .
