Hynes , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , MA , and approved June 29 , 2017 ( received for review February 23 , 2017 ) Kindlins and talins are integrin - binding proteins that are critically involved in integrin activation , an essential process for many funda - mental cellular activities including cell - matrix adhesion , migration , and proliferation . As FERM - domain – containing proteins , talins and kindlins , respectively , bind different regions of β - integrin cytoplasmic tails . However , compared with the extensively studied talin , little is known about how kindlins specifically interact with integrins and synergisti - cally enhance their activation by talins . Here , we determined crystal structures of kindlin2 in the apo - form and the β 1 - and β 3 - integrin bound forms . The apo - structure shows an overall architecture distinct from talins . The complex structures reveal a unique integrin recogni - tion mode of kindlins , which combines two binding motifs to provide specificity that is essential for integrin activation and signaling . Strik - ingly , our structures uncover an unexpected dimer formation of kind - lins . Interrupting dimer formation impairs kindlin - mediated integrin activation . Collectively , the structural , biochemical , and cellular results provide mechanistic explanations that account for the effects of kind - lins on integrin activation as well as for how kindlin mutations found in patients with Kindler syndrome and leukocyte - adhesion deficiency may impact integrin - mediated processes . kindlin | fermitin | FERMT2 | Mig - 2 | integrin signaling I ntegrins , composed of α - and β - subunits , are the major receptors mediating the cell – extracellular matrix ( ECM ) adhesion ( 1 – 3 ) . By connecting specific ECM proteins and diverse cytoskeletal regulators , integrins mediate bidirectional transmembrane signal - ing ( 4 , 5 ) . Stable integrin – ECM interaction and subsequent sig - naling require integrin activation , which was reported to be mediated by talin , a 4 . 1 - protein / ezrin / radixin / moesin ( FERM ) domain - containing protein ( 6 ) . Recently , kindlins , another family of FERM - containing proteins , were found to play crucial roles in integrin activation and signaling ( 7 – 12 ) . The kindlin family consists of three members in vertebrates , kindlin1 / 2 / 3 , each containing a FERM domain and a PH domain ( Fig . 1 A ) ( 13 ) . Compared with the typical FERM domain that consists of three lobes ( F1 , F2 , and F3 ) , kindlin - FERM contains an additional N - terminal F0 lobe . In kindlins , the F1 and F2 lobes are split by a largely unstructured insertion and the PH domain , re - spectively ( Fig . 1 A ) . Kindlins , although sharing high sequence similarity ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 ) , show distinct tissue distributions and nonredundant functions . Kindlin1 is expressed mainly in epi - thelia , and nonfunctional kindlin1 mutations lead to Kindler syn - drome , a congenital skin disease ( 14 – 16 ) . Expression of kindlin3 is restricted to the hematopoietic system , and mutations in kindlin3 were found to associate with leukocyte - adhesion deficiency type III ( LADIII ) ( 17 , 18 ) . Kindlin2 is ubiquitously expressed , and loss of kindlin2 in mice leads to peri - implantation lethality ( 11 ) . Kindlins are also involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis ( 19 ) . The kindlin - associated diseases are due , at least in part , to impaired integrin activation , focal adhesion ( FA ) formation , and cell spreading ( 10 , 12 ) . However , due to the lack of structure in - formation , the molecular mechanisms underlying kindlin - mediated integrin activation and signaling remain elusive . The current un - derstanding of integrin recognition by kindlins largely relies on comparisons to the talin / integrin structure , despite the fact that kindlins and talins play distinct roles in integrin signaling . Talins activate integrins by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of β - integrin ( β - tail ) via its atypical FERM domain . The β - tail contains two conserved “ NPxY ” ( “ x ” denotes any amino acids ) sequence motifs . The membrane - proximal NPxY has been identified as the talin - binding site , and the membrane - distal NPxY specifically interacts with kindlins ( 8 , 9 ) . Through the interaction with the proximal NPxY motif and the membrane - proximal helix , talins release the inhibitory α / β - intersubunit interaction by changing the conformation of the integrin trans - membrane region , eventually leading to increased binding affinities between integrins and ECM ligands ( 6 , 20 ) . Unlike talins , kindlins cannot directly alter the conformation of the integrin transmembrane helix and fail to activate integrin alone ( 21 ) . Nevertheless , although it is widely accepted that kindlins and talins synergistically promote integrin activation ( 9 , 11 ) , the underlying mechanism is unclear . To understand the molecular basis of kindlin - mediated integrin signaling , we solved crystal structures of kindlin2 in apo - and β - tail – bound forms . The complex structures reveal that beyond the canonical NPxY motif , the “ TTV / STF ” sequence between the proximal and distal NPxY motifs provides the binding specificity Significance Kindlin proteins play crucial roles in the integrin - signaling pathway by directly interacting with and activating integrins , which mediate the cell – extracellular matrix adhesion and signaling . Mutations of kindlins lead to diseases , such as Kindler syndrome , associated with skin blistering and atrophy ; leukocyte adhesion deficiency ; and cancers . However , the molecular basis underlying kindlin - mediated integrin activation remains to be determined . Here , we report the structural basis of the specific interaction between kindlins and integrins . Furthermore , we demonstrate that kindlins synergize integrin activation by forming a dimer , providing a model for un - derstanding integrin signaling . Finally , we interpret disease - causing mutations found in kindlins at the atomic level , which can be useful for understanding and treating these diseases . Author contributions : C . W . , Z .

Disruption of the TTV - binding pocket of kindlin2 results in the loss of FA localization of kindlin2 and defects in integrin ac - tivation . Unexpectedly , we found that kindlin2 forms an F2 domain - swapped dimer in crystal and solution . The mutations limiting the dimerization hamper integrin activation . Our structural , biochemical , and cellular data suggest that the monomer – dimer transition is im - portant for kindlin - mediated integrin activation . Additionally , our study provides structural insights into understanding the disease - causing mutations in kindlins . Results Overall Structure of Kindlin2 . We attempted to characterize the structure of kindlin2 . However , extensive trials failed to yield any crystal , presumably due to high flexibility of the predicted un - structured region of the long inserted sequence ( F1 insertion ) in the F1 lobe and the inserted PH domain in the F2 lobe ( Fig . 1 A ) . By removing the two flexible regions ( the truncated protein named hereafter kindlin2 Δ ) , we successfully obtained high - quality crystals with diffraction up to 2 . 6 Å . The structure of kindlin2 Δ was determined by preparing the Se - Met – labeled crystal ( SI Appendix , Table S1 ) . Strikingly , the two kindlin2 Δ molecules in one asymmetric unit form a dimer with a twofold rotation symmetry ( Fig . 1 B ) . The dimer is mediated mainly by the F2 lobe in a domain - swapped manner ( see Kindlin2 Forms a Domain - Swapped Dimer via Its F2 Lobe for details ) . Each kindlin2 Δ molecule is composed of four lobes , F0 – F3 , and adopts a compact fold via interlobe interactions ( Fig . 1 B ) . The F0 lobe keeps a similar fold with the isolated kindlin1 - F0 and kindlin2 - F0 ( 22 , 23 ) and attaches to the F1 lobe using a similar interaction mode found in talin ( Fig . 1 C and SI Appendix , Fig . S2 ) . The other three lobes , F1 , F2 , and F3 , interact with each other to form the typical clover - like shape found in most FERM domains ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) . Despite sharing structural similarity with kindlin2 in the respective lobes ( SI Appendix , Fig . S4 ) , the lobes in talin - FERM adopt a linear arrangement ( 24 ) due to the lack of interlobe interactions . In the kindlin2 Δ structure , the interlobe in - teractions are enhanced by the F1 insertion . Although largely dis - ordered , the long F1 insertion contains two short α - helices ( α 2 F1 and α 3 F1 ) protruding from the F1 - folding core ( SI Appendix , Fig . S4 ) . α 2 F1 is directly involved in F2 - mediated dimerization , and α 3 F1 tightly packs with the F3 lobe ( Fig . 1 B ) . Interestingly , compared with other FERM domains , kindlin2 contains an additional α - helix ( α 2 F3 ) at its C - terminal end , near the well - known target - binding region in other FERM domains ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) , which likely contrib - utes to creating a unique binding environment for target recognition . Given the high sequence similarity , the above structural features found in kindlin2 are very likely to be shared by other kindlins . Molecular Details of the Kindlin2 / β Integrin Interaction . The β 1 - integrin contains two NPxY motifs in the membrane proximal tail ( MPT ) and the membrane distal tail ( MDT ) for the binding of talins and kindlins , respectively ( Fig . 2 A and B ) . How can kindlins specifically recognize the NPxY motif in the MDT rather than the one in the MPT ? To address this question , we set out to solve the structure of the kindlin / β - tail complex . Isothermal titration calo - rimetry ( ITC ) - based assays showed that both the full - length kindlin2 and kindlin2 Δ bind to the β 1 - tail with a similar affinity ( K d of ∼ 20 – 30 μ M ) at a 1 : 1 ratio ( Fig . 2 D and E ) . Because the binding is relatively weak , we fused the β 1 - MDT to the C terminus of kindlin2 Δ to ensure a strict 1 : 1 stoichiometry in the complex . By using these strategies , we determined the kindlin - 2 Δ / β 1 - MDT complex structure ( SI Appendix , Table S1 ) . In the resulting complex , kindlin2 adopts a conformation es - sentially identical to the apo - form ( the rmsd values of 0 . 7 Å for the overall structure and of 0 . 5 Å for the F3 lobe ) , indicating that the β 1 - MDT binding does not induce obvious conformational changes . The β 1 - MDT folds as a β - strand to bind with a groove ( termed the αβ - groove , as formed mainly by α 1 F3 and β 5 F3 ) at the F3 lobe ( Fig . 2 B ) , which is a well - characterized binding region in FERM do - mains ( 25 – 30 ) . The 792 NPKY 795 sequence in the β 1 - MDT adopts a turn - like shape in which N792 β 1 and P793 β 1 insert their side - chains into the αβ - groove , and Y795 β 1 closely packs with K613 F3 ( Fig . 2 C ) . Mutating the interacting residues diminishes their interaction ( 8 , 31 , 32 ) ( Fig . 2 E ) . This NPxY - binding mode was also found in the talin - FERM / β 1 - MPT interactions ( 33 , 34 ) ( Fig . 2 B and SI Appendix , Fig . S5 ) , indicating that sequences other than NPKY are required for the β 1 - MDT ’ s specific binding to kindlins . Previous studies have suggested that several residues at the N - terminal to NPKY are involved in the kindlin / β - tail interaction ( 35 ) . Consistently , the conserved 788 TTV 790 sequence in the β 1 - MDT binds with the F3 lobe in a sequence - dependent manner ( Fig . 2 A and C ) . Specifically , T788 β 1 and T789 β 1 , respectively , form H - bonds with W619 F3 and N616 F3 , which are strictly con - served in kindlins but not in the corresponding position in talins ( SI Appendix , Fig . S4 B ) ; although not previously reported as an interacting residue , V790 β 1 interacts with a hydrophobic patch in the αβ - groove . Interestingly , the hydrophobic patch is formed by residues from not only α 1 F3 and β 5 F3 but also the α 2 F3 helix , which is , to the best of our knowledge , found only in kindlins ( Fig . 2 B and SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) . Thus , W619 F3 and N616 F3 together with L675 F3 in α 2 F3 provide a highly specific binding environment for Fig . 1 . Overall structure of kindlin2 .

Because the T788 β 1 - corresponding residue in the β 1 - MPT is an Asp ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5 C ) , it is unlikely to be accommodated by the hydrophobic αβ - groove . Consistent with our structural analysis , mutations in the TTV motif or the TTV - interacting site in kindlin2 disrupt the binding of kindlin2 to the β 1 - tail ( Fig . 2 D and E ) . The interface residues are highly con - served in both kindlins and several β - integrin isoforms ( Fig . 2 A and SI Appendix , Fig . S1 ) , indicating that the β - integrin binding mode found in the kindlin2 Δ / β 1 - MDT structure is common to all kindlins . Consistently , the binding of kindlin1 to the β 1 - tail shows a similar affinity of ∼ 20 μ M ( SI Appendix , Fig . S6 ) . Furthermore , by determining the kindlin2 Δ / β 3 - MDT structure , we confirmed that the β 3 - tail binds to kindlin2 using the same mode as β 1 - MDT ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5 D ) . In addition , although the very last three nonconserved residues ( 796 EGK 798 ) in the β 1 - tail were not well assigned ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5 ) , deletion of the EGK sequence abolishes the binding of integrins to kindlins in both our and others ’ observations ( Fig . 2 E ) ( 36 , 37 ) . Because the amide of E796 β 1 forms a main - chain / main - chain H - bond with the β 4 F3 / β 5 F3 loop in kindlin2 ( Fig . 2 C ) , deletion of EGK eliminates the H - bond , thereby disrupting the interaction , which aligns with previous findings that the binding of the β 1 - tail to kindlin2 requires at least one residue to the C terminus of Y795 β 1 in a sequence - independent manner ( 36 ) . The Binding of Kindlin2 to the TTV Motif in β 1 - Integrin Is Required for Integrin Signaling . Previously , we and others reported that kindlin2 is localized at FA and that the kindlin / integrin interaction is required for the FA localization of kindlin2 ( 7 , 8 , 35 ) . Therefore , we used the localization of kindlin2 to FA as an assay to examine the TTV - binding pocket in kindlin2 . As expected , kindlin2 localizes well to FAs in either wild - type or kindlin2 knockout HT1080 cells ( Fig . 3 A and SI Appendix , Fig . S7 ) . In contrast , either the W619Q or L675E mutation , which disrupts the TTV - binding pocket , abolishes kind - lin2 FA localization , suggesting that the TTV - mediated interaction is indispensable for kindlin2 to localize to FA . To further test whether the kindlin2 mutants affect cell function , we performed a cell - spreading assay using kindlin2 knockout cells . As expected , the reduced cell area of the knockout cells was largely recovered by expressing wild - type , but not TTV - binding deficient mutants ( SI Appendix , Fig . S8 ) . Because kindlins function as coactivators of integrin in the pres - ence of talin - FERM ( 9 , 11 ) , we coexpressed talin - FERM with var - ious kindlin2 constructs ( the wild - type or the TTV - binding deficient mutants ) in α II b β 3 integrin - expressing CHO A5 cells and performed an integrin activation assay . Consistent with previous findings , wild - type kindlin2 synergized with talin to activate integrin ( Fig . 3 B ) . The two TTV - binding deficient mutants , however , showed little syner - gistic enhancement in integrin activation ( Fig . 3 B ) . Taken together , the above structural , biochemical , and cellular characterizations clearly demonstrate that the binding of kindlin2 to the TTV motif of β 1 - integrin is crucial for kindlin - mediated integrin activation and signaling . Kindlin2 Forms a Domain - Swapped Dimer via Its F2 Lobe . Because we used the monomeric protein for crystallization , finding a dimeric kindlin2 structure in the crystals was unexpected . The symmetric dimer is mediated by the F2 lobe in a domain - swapped manner ( Fig . 1 B ) . Unlike talin - F2 , the F2 lobe in the kindlin2 dimer adopts an extended , “ open ” conformation ( SI Appendix , Fig . S4 A ) . Instead of forming two separated helices as found in talin - F2 , the corresponding part in kindlin2 becomes a long , contin - uous helix ( α 4 F2 ) . The rigidity of α 4 F2 prevents the region between α 2 F2 and α 4 F2 from forming an intramolecular interaction with the hydrophobic pocket formed by α 1 F2 , α 2 F2 , and α 2 F1 , but promotes the intermolecular interaction with the same structural elements in the other molecule ( Fig . 4 A ) . Interestingly , although the dimeric conformation was preferred in most crystallization conditions that formed crystals , the monomeric structure was found under a few conditions . By further modifying the deletion boundary of the PH domain ( residues 367 – 512 ) , we obtained a structure of the monomeric kindlin2 Δ ′ ( SI Appendix , Table S1 ) . Although most parts remain the same as the dimer , the mono - meric structure shows the “ closed ” conformation of the F2 lobe ( Fig . 4 A and SI Appendix , Fig . S9 ) . Specifically , the α 4 F2 helix is Fig . 2 . Structural and biochemical characterization of the kindlin2 / β 1 - tail in - teraction . ( A ) The cartoon diagram of β - integrins .

S10 ) . Therefore , the switch between the closed and open con - formation of the F2 lobe controls the monomer – dimer exchange of kindlin2 . In addition , the C - terminal part of α 2 F2 and the middle region of α 4 F2 are involved in forming another specific dimer interface ( SI Appendix , Fig . S10 ) , which may facilitate the monomer - to - dimer transition . Next , we tried to confirm the dimer conformation in solution . The freshly purified kindlin2 protein is monomeric as shown by analytical gel filtration ( Fig . 4 B ) . Interestingly , the dimer was de - tected in a sample placed at 4 °C for several days , and the dimer population increased over time ( Fig . 4 B and C ) . In comparison , no similar dimer formation was observed in talin - FERM protein placed at 4 °C ( SI Appendix , Fig . S11 A ) . To rule out the possibility that the dimer is formed nonspecifically by partially unfolded pro - tein , we measured the binding of the dimer to β - integrin . The dimer showed essentially the same binding affinity as the monomer ( Fig . 2 E ) . Furthermore , we used a site - specific chemical cross - linking approach to probe the dimer state . In the kindlin2 dimer struc - ture , V522 ( in one protomer ) and A318 ( in another protomer ) are close to each other in the dimer interface ( Fig . 4 A ) . If the dimer in solution adopts the same conformation found in the crystal structure , the respective substitution of V522 and A318 with Cys in the two protomers of the dimer would specifically promote the formation of a disulfide bond - mediated dimerization . Consistently , the dimerization process was greatly enhanced by mixing the V522C and A318C mutants , whereas neither the V522C nor the A318C mutant alone showed accelerated dimerization ( Fig . 4 D ) . To investigate kindlin2 dimer formation in cells , we cotrans - fected GFP - tagged W619Q kindlin2 , which shows abolished FA localizations , with Flag - tagged wild - type kindlin2 . The di - merization of kindlin2 would presumably bring the W619Q mutant to FA by interacting with the wild - type protein . Indeed , we detected the partial FA localization of W619Q by cotrans - fecting it with wild - type kindlin2 ( Fig . 4 E ) . Because kindlin family proteins are highly conserved ( SI Ap - pendix , Fig . S1 ) , it would be interesting to know whether other kindlins also form dimers . By using analytical gel filtration , we observed the similar dimerization process of kindlin1 ( SI Appen - dix , Fig . S11 B ) . Consistent with this , the kindlin homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans , UNC112 , was also shown to have the po - tential to form a dimer ( 38 ) . Thus , the monomer – dimer transition is likely an evolutionarily conserved property of kindlins . The Monomer – Dimer Transition Is Important for Kindlin - Mediated Integrin Activation . To understand the functional roles of the dimer formation of kindlins , we set out to design mutations that disrupt the monomer – dimer transition in kindlin2 . As talin - FERM keeps a monomeric state stably ( SI Appendix , Fig . S11 A ) , substitution of Fig . 3 . Functional characterization of the specific binding of kindlin2 to the β 1 - tail .

Through structural and sequence comparison , we found that for - mation of the closed conformation of talin - F2 largely relies on two turns , formed by “ 248 GP 249 ” and “ 287 GQ 288 , ” respectively ( Fig . 5 A ) . The corresponding sequences in kindlin2 are “ 327 LS 328 ” and “ 547 AQ 548 ” ( SI Appendix , Fig . S4 B ) , which appear in turns much less often ( 39 ) . To test whether the enhanced turn formation inhibits dimerization , we introduced either the LS / GP or the AQ / GP mutation into the kindlin2 Cys mutants . In agreement with our idea , the mixture of the V522C and A318C mutants carrying either the LS / GP or AQ / GP mutation showed diminished dimerization in solution ( Fig . 5 B ) , implying that both of the GP mutations disrupt the monomer - to - dimer transition . We next examined whether the two GP mutations affect the FA localization of kindlin2 . Consistent with our ITC data showing that the GP mutants retained the ability to bind the β 1 - tail ( Fig . 2 E ) , the two GP mutants colocalized with vinculin , as did the wild - type kindlin2 ( SI Appendix , Figs . S7 and S12 ) . In contrast , the AQ / GP mutant failed to recruit W619Q - kindlin2 to FA ( SI Appendix , Fig . S13 ) , suggesting that dimer formation in cells can be specifically disrupted by the GP mutations . Next , we asked whether the GP mutants are able to mediate integrin activation upon FA re - cruitment . By using the integrin activation assay , we found that both GP mutants showed significantly decreased ( ∼ 20 – 30 % ) integrin activation ( Fig . 5 C ) . These data indicate that the monomer – dimer transition of kindlin2 is important for integrin activation . Structural Implications of Kindlin Mutations in Diseases . Defective mutations of kindlins lead to various human genetic diseases , such as Kindler syndrome and LADIII ( 40 ) . More than 80 disease - causing mutations in kindlins have been identified ( SI Appendix , Table S2 ) . Most of these mutations are truncation or frame - shift mutations , thereby producing defective proteins ( SI Appendix , Fig . S14 A ) . Five missense mutations in kindlins have been reported ( 41 – 44 ) . By fitting them in the kindlin2 structure , we analyzed potential effects on protein folding or target binding due to these mutations ( SI Appendix , Fig . S14 B ) . The R297G and W559R mutations found in Kindler syndrome likely disrupt the F2 folding as well as the F1 / F2 interaction , whereas the Q595P mu - tation is likely to distort the β 5 F3 conformation and thereby disrupts the kindlin / integrin interaction . Consistent with our structural ana - lysis , the corresponding mutations in kindlin2 either disrupt the folding or abolish the integrin binding ( SI Appendix , Fig . S14 C and D ) . Thus , the genetic mutations found in kindlins are expected to alter their structures at different levels and thereby impair proper functions of kindlins . Discussion In this study , we have solved the crystal structures of kindlin2 , a ubiquitously expressed member of the kindlin family , as well as the kindlin2 / β - tails complex structures . The structures provide a major advancement in understanding the structural basis of the kindlin / integrin interaction as well as the genetic diseases asso - ciated with kindlin mutations . The monomer – dimer transition of kindlins described here provides insight into the mechanism of integrin signaling . Integrins form clusters upon full activation . There is evidence that kindlins activate integrins by promoting the clustering of talin - activated integrin and increasing integrin binding to multivalent ligands Fig . 5 .

The activated integrins are further clustered and fully activated via multivalent ECM ligand binding as well as the interaction network mediated by talins and dimeric kindlins . The monomer – dimer transition of kindlins in vivo may require regulators ( e . g . , membrane environment through either increasing local concentration or altering the conformation of kindlins ) .

The dimerization of kindlins provides a mechanistic explana - tion of how kindlins promote integrin clustering ( Fig . 6 ) . In this model , kindlins in either monomeric or dimeric forms are recruited to adhesion sites through interacting with the β - tails , whereas only dimeric kindlins can bridge talin - activated integrins to promote the clustering . Interestingly , talins are also dimerized antiparallelly , which is not mediated by the FERM domains but by the di - merization domain in their C terminus ( 46 ) , which may further enhance integrin clustering ( Fig . 6 ) . In line with our model , dis - ruption of the monomer – dimer transition of kindlin2 by the GP mutations led to impaired integrin activation and FA formation , but had little impact on the FA localization of kindlin2 ( Fig . 5 C and SI Appendix , Figs . S12 and S13 ) . The in vitro dimerization process occurs spontaneously yet slowly ( Fig . 4 B ) . Therefore , in living cells , dimer formation needs to be accelerated locally for fast and effi - cient integrin signaling . The regulatory factors for the monomer – dimer transition remain to be identified . Because kindlins link integrin - mediated adhesion to the cytoskeleton via interacting with other actin cytoskeleton regulators ( ILK , migfilin , paxillin , etc . ) as well as actin ( 7 , 47 – 49 ) , it would be interesting to investigate whether dimeric kindlins impact these interactions or vice versa . Materials and Methods All proteins used in this study were expressed in Escherichia coli and pu - rified by Ni 2 + - NTA affinity chromatography followed by size - exclusion chromatography . Crystals were obtained by the sitting drop vapor diffu - sion method at 16 °C . An extended description of the methods for protein preparation , crystallography , and biochemical and cellular assays is in - cluded in SI Appendix . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . We thank Prof .
