We have previously demonstrated the endocytic translocation of podocin to the subcellular area in severely injured podocytes and found that this process is the primary disease trigger . Here we identified the protein sorting nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) as a novel facilitator of podocin endocytosis in a yeast two - hybrid analysis . SNX9 is involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , actin rearrangement and vesicle transport regulation . Our results revealed and confirmed that SNX9 interacts with podocin exclusively through the Bin – Amphiphysin – Rvs ( BAR ) domain of SNX9 . Immunofluorescence staining revealed the expression of SNX9 in response to podocyte adriamycin - induced injury both in vitro and in vivo . Finally , an analysis of human glomerular disease biopsy samples demonstrated strong SNX9 expression and co - localization with podocin in samples representative of severe podocyte injury , such as IgA nephropathy with poor prognosis , membranous nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis . In conclusion , we identified SNX9 as a facilitator of podocin endocytosis in severe podocyte injury and demonstrated the expression of SNX9 in the podocytes of both nephropathy model mice and human patients with irreversible glomerular disease . Kidney podocytes , which are highly specialized , terminally differentiated epithelial cells located outside of the glomerular basement membrane , serve as a final barrier to urinary protein loss 1 . Continuous injury to the podo - cytes induces irreversible podocyte loss and glomerulosclerosis development , leading to chronic renal failure 2 . As the number of patients with end - stage renal disease is growing worldwide 3 , it is very important to prevent or attenuate podocyte injury and thus protect the kidneys from chronic renal failure ; in this context , elucidating the pathogenesis of podocyte injury is urgently needed . Several proteins play key roles in the maintenance of podocyte integrity . In particular , slit - diaphragm pro - teins , such as nephrin , podocin and CD2AP , were found to be critical in the prevention of proteinuria because the mutation and inactivation of these proteins led to severe proteinuria and consequent chronic renal fail - ure 4 . Podocin is expressed at the slit diaphragm , where it is thought to act as an intracellular scaffold protein by assembling slit - diaphragm components in lipid raft - associated microdomains 4 , 5 . Indeed , Boute et al . were the first to demonstrate a causative link between mutations in NPHS2 , which encodes podocin , and childhood nephrotic syndrome 6 . In addition , NPHS2 was found to be the most frequently affected gene associated with steroid - resistant nephrotic syndrome 7 , and dysregulated podocin intracellular trafficking was observed in several diseases associated with NPHS2 mutations 8 . Endocytosis serves as a portal ; specifically , this process involves the formation of vesicles for the internal - ization and retrieval of plasma membrane components or transmembrane receptors . Endocytic trafficking can be divided into two main pathways ; the classic clathrin - mediated endocytic pathway and the non - classic clathrin - independent pathway 9 . To date , a great deal of work has focused on clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , leading to an increasing understanding of the mechanisms by which the proteins involved in this process recruit cargo into developing clathrin - coated pits and subsequently form clathrin - coated vesicles 10 . Although CME is certainly an extremely important endocytic mechanism that accounts for a large proportion of endocytic 1 Division of Nephrology , Department of Internal Medicine , Juntendo University Faculty of Medicine , Tokyo , Japan . 2 Laboratory of Proteomics and Biomolecular Science , Research Support Center , Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine , Tokyo , Japan . 3 Medical Innovation Center , TMK project , Graduate School of Medicine , Kyoto University , Kyoto , Japan . 4 Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology , Graduate School of Medicine , Tokyo Medical and Dental University , Tokyo , Japan .

Recent findings from studies on genetic mouse models of disease , as well as human genetic mutations that result in the loss of integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier , suggest a critical role for endocytosis in podocyte biology 12 . This is because in podocytes , the endocytic process plays a fundamental role in the development and maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier . Thus , the loss of key molecular machinery results in defective actin regulation , faulty slit - diaphragm maintenance and increases the uptake of lipoproteins , or integrins , which might have deleterious effects on podocyte health 13 . Previously , our group has discovered a difference in the immunostaining patterns of podocin and synap - topodin , normally co - located in the foot process , in both a rat model of puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis ( PAN ) and patients with IgA nephropathy 14 . In this previous study , localization of podocin shifted from the slit diaphragm to the podocyte cytoplasm in the context of severe podocyte injury , suggesting a role for endocytosis in glomerular health . Here we describe a further novel finding that the protein sorting nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) interacts with podocin in podocytes . SNX9 is specifically involved in endocytosis and also participates in actin rearrangement and regulates various stages of vesicle transport 15 , 16 . We demonstrate that SNX9 is strongly expressed and co - localizes with podocin in both kidneys from adriamycin ( ADR ) - injected mice and kidney biopsy samples from human patients with glomerular diseases leading to glomerulosclerosis . Our evidence indicates that SNX9 plays a role in podocin endocytosis and might help to advance our understanding of podocyte injury . Results The Bin – Amphiphysin – Rvs ( BAR ) domain of SNX9 interacts with podocin . To identify a pro - tein that would trigger podocin endocytosis , we conducted a yeast two - hybrid screening using the C - terminal fragment of podocin as bait . We identified SNX9 , a member of the sorting nexin family of proteins that is widely expressed and plays a role in endocytosis , as a novel podocin - interacting protein . Next , we conducted co - immu - noprecipitation assays to confirm the interaction between podocin and SNX9 using lysates of FLAG - podocin - and GFP - SNX9 - overexpressing cells and confirmed an interaction between podocin and SNX9 in vitro . We used HEK293T cells as podocytes which show relatively low level of transfection efficiency , typical ranging from 10 % to 20 % for cells grown under permissive conditions 17 , making it difficult to overexpress gene . To map the podo - cin binding site ( s ) in SNX9 , we tested the abilities of various truncated GFP - SNX9 constructs 18 to co - precipi - tate with FLAG - podocin ( Fig . 1a , b ) ; results show that both GFP SNX9 - BAR and SNX9 - PX - BAR co - precipitate with FLAG - podocin , while SNX9 - Δ BAR and SNX9 - Δ PX - BAR do not interact with podocin , and no SNX9 binding was observed with a FLAG control ( Fig . 1b ) . To further demonstrate that podocin can directly bind to SNX9 , we performed GST pull - down assays with purified recombinant proteins according to our previously pub - lished protocols 19 . Purified GST - SNX9 , not GST alone , binds to purified FLAG - podocin ( Fig . 1c ) , and podocin was subsequently recognized as a band with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa using Western blot analysis . Additional higher molecular weights were also detected , suggesting the presence of podocin oligomers 20 . To fur - ther confirm the interaction between podocin and SNX9 , endogenous proteins were immunoprecipitated from ADR - treated cultured podocytes using anti - podocin and anti - SNX9 antibodies . Anti - SNX9 antibody precipitated SNX9 and coprecipitated podocin . Conversely , anti - podocin antibody precipitated podocin and coprecipitated SNX9 ( Fig . 1d ) . However , anti - GFP antibody did not precipitate SNX9 or podocin . Therefore , these results could prove the interaction between SNX9 and podocin via the BAR domain of SNX9 in injured podocytes . To delineate the functional relevance of the SNX9 – podocin interaction , we conducted co - transfection studies of COS7 cells . First , we tested whether SNX9 would interact with podocin in COS7 cells and found that following transient transfection , GFP - SNX9 did indeed co - localize with FLAG - podocin . Next , to confirm the results of our co - immunoprecipitation assay , we co - transfected cells with truncated GFP - SNX9 mutants and FLAG - podocin . Again , GFP - SNX9 - BAR co - localized with FLAG - podocin . In contrast , when cells were co - transfected with FLAG - podocin and a GFP - SNX9 mutant lacking the BAR domain , we observed little co - localization ( Fig . 2 ) . These data confirm the results of our co - immunoprecipitation assay and verify that SNX9 interacts with podocin via the SNX9 BAR domain . Kidneys from ADR - injected mice exhibit high levels of co - localized SNX9 and podocin . In a previous study , we demonstrated translocation of podocin to the cytoplasm via the endocytosis pathway in injured podocytes 14 . Here , we investigated the potential association of SNX9 with the endocytic translocation of podocin to the cytoplasm in injured podocytes . Using immunofluorescence staining to detect SNX9 expression in kidney samples from normal and ADR - injected mice ( Fig . 3 ) , we observed weak SNX9 expression and little co - localization with podocin in the normal mouse kidney ( day zero ) , in contrast to a significant increase in SNX9 expression in the podocyte cytoplasm on days seven and 14 after ADR injection . We further noted that despite a decrease in podocin expression after ADR injection , as described previously 21 , the SNX9 and podocin immuno - fluorescent signals were merged after ADR injection , especially in the podocyte cytoplasm . SNX9 facilitates the translocation of podocin in injured human podocytes . To evaluate SNX9 expression in vitro , we subjected non - treated and ADR - treated cultured human podocytes to immunofluores - cence staining ( Fig . 4a ) . Non - treated cultured podocytes showed very little SNX9 expression ; in contrast , SNX9 expression was significantly increased in podocytes after ADR treatment . Notably , SNX9 expression increased in a dose - dependent manner . Additionally , we confirmed the co - localization of SNX9 with podocin in podocytes following ADR treatment , which further confirmed the SNX9 – podocin interaction . To study the localization of SNX9 and podocin in ADR - treated podocytes , we performed subcellular frac - tionation using OptiPrep gradient centrifugation . Podocin remained in fractions 11 – 13 after ADR treatment . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 43921 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep43921 However , SNX9 appeared de novo in fractions 9 – 13 and was distributed in the same fractions where podocin was predominant ( Fig . 4b ) . To investigate the role of SNX9 in injured podocytes , we studied the loss - of - function of SNX9 in ADR - treated podocytes . A decrease in SNX9 expression was found in SNX9 siRNA - transfected podo - cytes compared with that in non - transfected podocytes ( Fig . 4c ) . SNX9 siRNA - transfected podocytes after ADR treatment exhibited membranous and moderate cytoplasmic expression of podocin , whereas non - transfected podocytes after ADR treatment exhibited strong cytoplasmic and little membranous expression . SNX9 co - localizes with endosomal markers in transfected COS7 cells . To confirm the involvement of SNX9 in endocytosis , COS7 cells were transfected with GFP - SNX9 ( Fig . 5 ) and subsequently co - stained with EEA1 and Rab5 ( early endosomal compartment marker ) . Notably , co - localization of SNX9 dots with EEA1 dots was detected in merged figures obtained under high magnification . Furthermore , results show that co - localization of SNX9 with Rab5 was more pronounced . SNX9 is detectable in human kidneys affected by IgA nephropathy , membranous nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis . To assess SNX9 expression in human kidney glomeruli , we subjected human kidney biopsy specimens to immunofluorescence staining ( see Methods ) . Normal human kid - ney tissues show moderate SNX9 glomerular staining as shown in The Human Protein Atlas ; http : / / www . pro - teinatlas . org / . SNX9 expression and co - localization with podocin were significantly higher in specimens from patients with IgA nephropathy with poor prognosis ( IgAN - poor ) , membranous nephropathy ( MN ) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) ; these specimens are associated with severe podocyte injury compared with Figure 1 .

Discussion In this study , we identified the protein SNX9 as a novel interaction partner of podocin in podocytes . We detected strong SNX9 expression and co - localization with podocin in ADR - injected mice and samples from human patients with severe glomerular diseases such as IgAN - poor , MN and FSGS , suggesting a pivotal role for SNX9 in podocin endocytosis under pathological conditions . Sorting nexins have roles in diverse processes such as endocytosis , endosomal sorting and signaling 22 , 23 . Given their fundamental natures , these proteins are associated with diseases in which endosomal function is adversely perturbed , such as Alzheimer’s disease and pathogenic infection 24 , 25 . In this study , SNX9 was found to interact with podocin via its BAR domain ; this domain enables the formation of a crescent - shaped homodimer , senses and generates positive membrane curvature and induces membrane tubulation 26 . Furthermore , membrane tubu - lation via polymeric BAR domain assembly is thought to be regulated by lipid binding 27 . As podocin is a lipid mitochondria protein 17 that recruits cholesterol to organize the lipid microenvironment of associated ion chan - nel complexes 28 , podocin is thought to have an affinity for the BAR domain , and these structures share a similar polymerizing function . Our data are consistent both with these inferred roles and their functions . Recent findings have suggested a critical role for endocytosis in podocyte biology , with a particular focus on nephrin 29 – 31 . However , very little is known about podocin endocytosis , and its precise mechanisms remain unclear . Nevertheless , Shono et al . have demonstrated that podocin co - localizes with the coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor ( CAR ) at the tight junctions between foot processes in PAN rat kidneys and that podocin Figure 2 . SNX9 co - localizes with podocin in transfected COS7 cells .

Moreover , podocin and CAR exhibit a diffuse punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm in COS - 7 cells co - transfected with both proteins . In contrast , however , Godel et al . demonstrated that a fraction of podocin resides in the CD63 / LAMP3 - positive late endosomal compartment and has limited co - localized with EEA1 in transiently co - transfected HeLa cells 33 . We recently reported considerable co - localization of both podocin and nephrin with Rab7 and LAMP1 in podocyte - specific cathepsin D knock - out mice ( CD pdKO ) , compared with control mice 34 , suggesting that podocin and nephrin are mainly localized in the late endosomes and lysosomes of CD pdKO mouse podocyte cell bodies . Further , electron microscopic examination revealed that cytoplasmic podocin was localized in granular osmiophilic deposits ( GRODs ) . One previous report has demonstrated that podocin trafficking depends on the raft - mediated , non - classic , clathrin - independent endocytic pathway 33 . Intriguingly , the podocin - related protein flotillin - 1 defines a clathrin - independent endocytic pathway 35 , suggesting that podocin not only assembles members of the slit dia - phragm , but also orchestrates their internalization via a self - defined pathway 33 . Our group demonstrated the co - localization of podocin with Rab5 in PAN rats , a model of glomerular sclerosis development , indicating that podocin interacts with the CME pathway . We have also previously clarified 15 , 16 that SNX9 is involved in CME via immunofluorescent analysis of transfected COS7 cells . Specifically , transiently expressed GFP - SNX9 is co - localized with both EEA1 and Rab5 , indicating a role for SNX9 in CME . Consistent with our earlier findings 14 , this study demonstrates the involvement of SNX9 in severe podocyte injury and a potential role for this protein as a trigger of podocin endocytosis by CME . Regarding podocyte endocytosis , Soda et al . reported massive proteinuria and kidney failure with histological features suggestive of FSGS in podocyte - specific dynamin - 1 and 2 double knock - out mice 36 . This finding sup - ports an important role for dynamin , which is essential to CME , in the maintenance of the renal permeability barrier 37 . Notably , SNX9 , which binds directly to dynamin and stimulates dynamin assembly , also stimulates the basal GTPase activity of dynamin and thus potentiates assembly - stimulated GTPase activity on liposomes 38 . The SNX9 - dependent recruitment of dynamin to the membrane is regulated by an interaction between SNX9 and aldolase 39 . In other words , SNX9 is required for efficient CME and regulates dynamin activity . In this study , SNX9 expression emerged in the setting of severe glomerular damage , indicating that SNX9 might facilitate podocin endocytosis by regulating dynamin in an attempt at protection from severe damage . Furthermore , ADR - treated SNX9 KD podocytes exhibited membranous and moderate cytoplasmic expression of podocin , whereas non - transfected cell exhibited strong cytoplasmic and little membranous expression . These data indi - cate that SNX9 is crucial and may facilitate podocin endocytosis in injured podocytes . As ADR induces cell Figure 3 .

Although few cells survived after ADR treatment , it was possible to perform immunohistochemistry . Therefore , the cells were cultured with a stronger ADR treatment for immunohistochemistry . SNX9 may connect with podo - cin during the early phase of podocyte injury , as indicated by the subcellular fractionation of cultured human podocytes , and then recruit podocin to cytoplasm during the late phase of podocyte injury , as indicated by immunohistochemistry . After endocytosis , cargo enters and is sorted in the early endosomes and is either recycled back to the plasma membrane or degraded in the late endosomes and lysosomes 9 . The destinies of slit - diaphragm proteins following endocytosis remains unclear , as cargo can be transferred from early to late endosomes followed by lysosomal degradation , the trans - Golgi network and recycling endosomes 13 . Podocin was found to be internalized with SNX9 in early endosomes , designated by EEA1 and Rab5 , and co - localized with the late endosomal proteins Rab7 and LAMP1 34 . SNX9 might promote podocyte injury by degrading podocin in lysosomes , or prevent damage by recycling podocin back to the plasma membrane . In conclusion , we have demonstrated the emergence of SNX9 expression and consequent internalization of podocin via endocytosis in an ADR - induced nephropathy model , as well as in samples from patients with IgA nephropathy with a poor prognosis , MN and FSGS . SNX9 immunostaining might indicate the degree of podocyte injury . Furthermore , SNX9 may be the key to understanding glomerular injury . Future studies involving SNX9 knockout and overexpression models might clarify the role of SNX9 in podocyte injury . Figure 4 . Increased SNX9 expression and co - localization with podocin are detectable in the cytoplasm of ADR - treated WT podocytes , whereas SNX9 KD podocytes exhibit little cytoplasmic expression of podocin .

The cell pellet was suspended in 1 - ml extraction buffer , containing 5 mM Tes - NaOH ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 0 . 3 M sucrose and protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Diagnostics , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) , and the cells were homoge - nized by passing the suspension through 26 - gauge syringe ( 10 up – down strokes ) . Homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min . The supernatant ( post - nuclear supernatant ) was retained . The pellet was re - suspended in 1 - ml extraction buffer , homogenized as described above and re - centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min . The pooled post - nuclear supernatant ( 1 . 6 ml ) was loaded on 10 - ml linear OptiPrep gradients ( 5 – 25 % ) that had been pre - pared according to the manufacturer’s protocol and centrifuged at 150 , 000 × g for 3 h . Fractions of 0 . 9 ml were collected from the bottom to the top . Aliquots of fractions were treated with SDS - PAGE sample buffer , applied on 10 % or 12 . 5 % SDS - PAGE gels and electrophoresed . The separated polypeptides were examined by western blot analyses using antibodies against LAMP1 , β subunit of mitochondrial F1F0 - ATPase , calnexin , caveolin , podocin and SNX9 . Immunohistochemistry . Differentiated podocytes and COS7 cells were cultured on collagen type I - coated cover slips . Differentiated podocytes were treated with ADR . Cells were fixed with 4 % paraformalde - hyde , permeabilised with 0 . 3 % Triton and incubated with blocking solution ( 2 % foetal calf serum [ FCS ] , 2 % bovine serum albumin [ BSA ] , 0 . 2 % fish gelatin in PBS ) and primary and secondary antibodies . We used 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) as a nuclei marker . For the immunofluorescent staining of ADR mouse kidneys , the kidneys were fixed by perfusion of 4 % paraformaldehyde and 20 % sucrose in PBS . The fixed kidneys were frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound . Frozen 4 - μ m - thick sections sections were incubated with primary antibodies specific for SNX9 ( anti - SNX9 rabbit polyclonal antibody ) , podocin ( anti - podocin guinea pig polyclonal antibody ) and developed with secondary antibodies . The human kidney specimens were fixed with cold acetone for five minutes and frozen 4 - μ m - thick sections were immunostained in the same manner as described for ADR mice . All images were captured using a confocal laser microscope ( FV1000 ; Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . Mouse Model . Female BALB / c mice were purchased from a commercial vendor ( Oriental Yeast Co . , Ltd . , Tokyo , Japan ) , and ADR nephropathy was induced as previously described 45 . In brief , ADR ( doxorubicin hydro - chloride ; Wako , Osaka , Japan ) diluted with 0 . 9 % saline was injected into eight - week - old BALB / c mice via the tail vein at a dose of 11 mg / kg . Age - matched control mice were injected with an equal volume of PBS only . After anaesthesia with sodium pentobarbital ( 100 mg / kg BW ; Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma , Osaka , Japan ) , mice were euthanized on days seven and 14 after the injection of ADR . All mice were housed under specific pathogen - free conditions in standard animal cages with free access to standard chow and drinking water . All animal handling and experiments were performed strictly in accordance with the recommendations of the guideline for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Juntendo University Faculty of Medicine . The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Juntendo University , Tokyo , Japan . Renal histology . Mouse kidneys were fixed via perfusion with 4 % paraformaldehyde and 20 % sucrose in PBS . For the immunofluorescence study , fixed kidneys were frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound . Human kidney specimens were collected from kidney biopsies performed at Juntendo University Hospital , Tokyo , www . nature . com / scientificreports / 10 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 43921 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep43921 Japan . We analysed samples from two groups of patients with glomerular diseases ; those with minor podocyte injuries and those with severe podocyte injuries . MCNS and IgAN - good prognosis cause minor podocyte injury , whereas IgAN - poor prognosis , MN and FSGS cause severe podocyte injury and consequent glomerulosclerosis . As human controls , we used biopsy samples from patients with minor glomerular abnormalities . We diagnosed and classified patients with IgA nephropathy according to the second guideline of IgA nephropathy 46 . All glo - meruli in the stained areas of human kidney biopsy specimens were evaluated per patient . For immunostaining , each patient had two to six glomeruli , and six patients in each group were examined . The staining area was automatically quantified using Tissue Studio ( Definiens , Munich , Germany ) 47 . In brief , the glomerular area was carefully traced by hand and automatically measured . Custom - made image analysis algorithms were applied to the digital slides to automatically detect and quantify the staining areas . Behind a configured action stands a set of algorithms with defined parameters . The respective algorithms were automatically loaded . The staining area / glomerular area ratio was also calculated . This study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Juntendo University Hospital . Informed consent was obtained from all patients . Statistical analysis . All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6 . 0 for Windows ( GraphPad Software Inc . , San Diego , CA , USA ) . Data are presented as means ± standard errors of the means . Comparisons between groups were analysed using a one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) , or Student’s t - test . Differences with P values < 0 . 05 were considered significant . References 1 . Greka , A . & Mundel , P . Cell biology and pathology of podocytes . Annu . Rev .
