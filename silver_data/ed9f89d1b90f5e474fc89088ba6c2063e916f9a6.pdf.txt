cists . But not only for physicists is nuclear magnetic resonance of great fascination . More and more chemists , biologists , and medical doctors discover NMR , not so much for its conceptual beauty but for its extraordinary usefulness . ’ Richard Ernst started his Nobel lecture with these words , when he was awarded with the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1991 for ’his contribution to the development of the methodology of high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy’ . Within a few decades , NMR spectroscopy has developed from the ﬁrst theoretical approaches into a well es - tablished and routinely applied technique covering a wide range of distinct ﬁelds . Every organic chemistry lab requires the NMR spectroscopy to verify the synthesized com - pounds . Moreover , NMR imaging represents an essential application in the medical sector complementing the classical X - ray examination as it also allows investigation of the diﬀerent soft tissues . Complementing the X - ray crystallography holds also for the study of biomacromolecules . Even though it is generally true that a picture is worth a thousand words , this statement does not completely account for proteins and nucleic acids . Whereas X - ray crystallography elucidates reliable three dimensional structures in a reasonable amount of time , these static structures often lack explanations for the biologically relevant , functional activity of the protein . Although an averaged NMR structure in the same way represents a static picture of the protein , the technique itself possesses the capacity to additionally study structural changes over time . Hence , NMR spectroscopy is the only experimental technique with abilities to determine atomic res - olution structures as well as investigate dynamics and intermolecular interactions of biological macromolecules at atomic detail . Many proteins frequently undergo structural rearrangements to complete their func - tions . Transitions from low energy , ground state conformations to higher energy , excited state conformations play a vital role in protein function . Thus , to fully comprehend 1 Chapter 1 Introduction the biological mechanism of a protein , it is essential to obtain information on the time dependent conformational ﬂuctuations of the protein which generate the excited state although with low population . This conformational exchange can be exquisitely inves - tigated by a powerful suite of relatively new heteronuclear NMR relaxation techniques . Recent methodologies have focused on µ s – ms time scales , since many biologically rel - evant processes occur in this time regime , such as enzyme catalysis , protein folding , and allosteric transitions . NMR spectroscopy is unique in this respect , allowing the investigation of important biological events that are relatively inaccessible to other techniques . Since the discovery that numerous human diseases are caused by protein aggregation , the biophysical characterization of misfolded states and their aggregation mechanisms has attracted enormous interest . In general , proteins possess the intrinsic property to fold rapidly and spontaneously to their native structures that are required for their speciﬁc functions . How the disordered polypeptide chains manage to navigate through the rough folding landscape and in most cases reach the functional native state within a reasonable amount of time is still a fascinating and challenging subject to current research . Since the native conformation is not the only fold available to a polypeptide chain , but an alternative structure may represent another ground state of protein fold - ing , research into the speciﬁc features that favor productive folding into the correct , functional native state over oﬀ pathway species that run the risk of aggregation has received increased attention . Structural characterization of the folding pathway and in addition of the intermediate state of the antibody domain C L by NMR spectroscopy in Chapter 3 provides insights into these speciﬁc features that might guide an unfolded polypeptide chain successfully to its biologically active structure . Furthermore , the detailed picture of the major folding intermediate of the C L domain allows identiﬁcation of structural properties that might have evolved over the course of evolution to avoid pathogenic misfolding reactions while preserving an identical protein topology . Although many proteins fold to their native structures rapidly and spontaneously , recent studies indicate that a surprisingly high number of gene sequences in eukary - otic genomes encode intrinsically disordered proteins . These proteins that lack a well structured three dimensional fold are biologically active , in contrast to the classic no - tion that proteins require a well deﬁned globular structure to be functional . Due to the persistence of these natively unfolded proteins throughout evolution despite the permanent risk of degradation or causing diseases , these non - globular structures seem to play a pivotal role in cellular biology . In general , intrinsically disordered proteins fold into ordered structures only upon binding to their cellular targets . The mech - anism by which folding is coupled to binding remains poorly understood , but it has been hypothesized on theoretical grounds that the disordered protein binds weakly and non - speciﬁcally to its target and folds as it approaches the cognate binding site . NMR spectroscopic investigation on the structural characteristics of the constant domain of the heavy chain , C H 1 , of the antibody molecule in Chapter 4 extends the growing class of natively unfolded proteins by a prominent member of the immunoglob - 2 Introduction ulin superfamily . The unstructured nature of the C H 1 domain results in retention of the whole antibody heavy chain in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . Only upon association with the antibody light chain , the interaction with the C L domain induces structure formation in the C H 1 domain . A detailed description of this induced folding reveals insights into the mechanism of folding upon binding by which intrinsically disordered proteins perform their diverse biological functions like in the case of antibody molecules the secretion control from the ER . Intrinsically structured proteins must exhibit a distinct mechanism to fulﬁll their biological functions and transfer cellular signals . Instead of inducing folding , binding of a ligand induces conformational changes . Allosteric processes involve coupling of conformational changes between two widely separated binding sites . Since the binding of a ligand to one site can aﬀect the other through a propagated change in the protein shape , nature uses this strategy to regulate protein activity . Chapter 5 studies the role of allosteric regulation in the process of cell migration . Actin ﬁlament binding by the focal adhesion associated protein talin stabilizes cell - substrate adhesion . Because increased intracellular pH promotes cell migration , a hall - mark of metastatic carcinomas , and in addition actin binding by talin is pH sensitive , focal adhesion remodeling might be increased through lower aﬃnity talin actin binding . NMR spectroscopic investigation of the pH sensitive USH - I / LWEQ module of talin re - veals a structural mechanism for pH dependent actin binding , suggesting that focal adhesion turnover is in part allosterically mediated by pH dependent aﬃnity of talin for actin binding . 3 Chapter 2 Theoretical Aspects In NMR spectroscopic investigations of proteins and nucleic acids , nuclear spin relax - ation is a critical factor for optimizing the set - up of the NMR experiments , provides key data for de novo structure determination , and can also provide a wealth of information on global and intramolecular motions that may be crucial for macromolecules to adapt their structures to particular functions . In a static magnetic ﬁeld B 0 , the thermal equilibrium state of a statistical ensemble of nuclear spins gives rise to a macroscopic magnetization along B 0 ( longitudinal mag - netization ) . The application of an external perturbation , typically one or a sequence of several radio frequency pulses irradiated perpendicular to B 0 , generates transverse magnetization in the xy - plane . Subsequently , the longitudinal magnetization aims to recover to the equilibrium state - a process named longitudinal relaxation and the rate at which this process occurs is determined by the longitudinal relaxation time T 1 . The disappearance of transverse magnetization by transverse relaxation , with a rate given by the transverse relaxation time T 2 , may be governed entirely by reestablishment of the equilibrium state of the longitudinal magnetization with T 2 = T 1 . However , for proteins and nucleic acids generally additional relaxation processes contribute to the transverse relaxation , resulting in T 2 < T 1 . In general , reestablishment of the equilibrium state of the longitudinal magnetization could be achieved by spontaneous and stimulated emission of a photon . Though , the probability W for transition from the higher to the lower energy state of an isolated magnetic dipole by spontaneous emission of a photon of energy ∆ E = ~ ω 0 is given by [ 1 ] W = µ 0 γ 2 ~ ω 30 6 πc 3 ( 2 . 1 ) in which c is the speed of light . For instance , the probability of an 1 H spin with a Larmor frequency of 500 MHz for this transition would be W ≈ 10 − 21 s − 1 . Therefore , 5 Chapter 2 Theoretical Aspects contributions to the overall relaxation rate from transitions between the discrete energy levels of the spin systems by spontaneous emission of photons are negligible . Nuclear spin relaxation can thus entirely be accounted for by suitable coupling of the spin sys - tems with the surroundings which allows the exchange of energy between the spins and the lattice . The lattice is represented by random molecular motions and hence nuclear spin relaxation in solution can be treated as arising from spin interactions modulated by random rotational and translational motions of the molecules in which the spins are located . In longitudinal relaxation , only direct energy exchange ( non - adiabatic relax - ation processes ) between the spin systems and the lattice contributes to the observed magnetization recovery rate . In this case , transition of the spin system from a higher ( lower ) energy state to a lower ( higher ) energy state is accompanied by an energy con - serving transition of the lattice from a lower ( higher ) to a higher ( lower ) energy state . Since the lattice presumably resides in a permanent thermal equilibrium with a larger population in the lower energy state , a transition of the spin system from higher energy to lower energy is more probable . Thus , exchange of energy between the spin system and the lattice brings the spin system into a state of thermal equilibrium in which the populations of the stationary states have the Boltzmann distribution . On the contrary , in transverse relaxation besides direct energy exchange loss of phase coherence by adi - abatic relaxation processes also accounts for the decay rate of transverse relaxation . These adiabatic processes do not alter the populations of the states and no energy is exchanged between the spin system and the lattice , as transitions between stationary states do not occur . Rather , ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁelds at the sites of the nuclear spins determine the adiabatic relaxation . Typically , a nuclear spin experiences many diﬀer - ent sources of local magnetic ﬁelds which ﬂuctuate as the molecule rotates in solution . For instance , neighboring nuclear spins create magnetic ﬁelds , that constitute the basis for the dipole - dipole relaxation mechanism . Furthermore , local magnetic ﬁelds are also generated by induced electron currents , leading to spin relaxation through chemical shift anisotropy . All of these local ﬁelds are modulated by the rotation of the molecule . From the point of view of physical chemistry , proteins are long chained polymers whose structures are mainly based on weak non - covalent interactions . Due to thermal motions , the resulting structures can thus undergo large ﬂuctuations and sample a range of conformations . These ﬂuctuations include among others collision with solvent molecules , libration of closely packed interior groups , hinge bending motion between elements of well deﬁned secondary structures , rolling and sliding of helices and β - sheets , and concerted ﬂuctuations and jumps of neighboring dihedral angles . Such motions may cover a wide range of amplitudes , energies , and time scales . [ 2 ] A typical sample for NMR experiments with a protein concentration of 1 mM in 500 µ L of solvent contains 10 17 protein molecules performing thermally activated ran - dom walks colliding with 10 22 water molecules . [ 3 ] An analytic description of this sce - nario exceeds by far the scope of current theoretical and computational methods . How - ever , as already evident in the early and formative years of gaining an understanding of NMR phenomena , the nuclear spins couple only weakly with the molecular surround - ings . [ 4 ] Consequently , basic thermodynamic arguments were suﬃcient to predict the 6 2 . 1 Protein Dynamics behavior of an ensemble of such ’non - interacting’ spins . In the meantime , a variety of nuclear spin relaxation theories have been developed to characterize the macroscopic response of spin systems to time dependent external magnetic ﬁelds . In 1946 Bloch introduced the concept of relaxation time into NMR with his phe - nomenological theory of spin relaxation . [ 5 ] This theory assumes that the magnetization along the external magnetic ﬁeld decays exponentially to the equilibrium state with a time constant T 1 or the spin - lattice or longitudinal relaxation time . The magnetization perpendicular to the external ﬁeld similarly decays exponentially to an equilibrium value of zero characterized by the spin - spin or transverse relaxation time T 2 . Shortly afterwards in 1948 , the ﬁrst microscopic theory of spin relaxation proposed by Bloem - bergen , Purcell , and Pound ( BPP ) followed the Bloch equations . [ 6 ] The BPP theory relates the spin relaxation times to transition probabilities between nuclear spin energy levels and the lattice corresponds to a random ﬁeld that interacts with the spins to give rise to the relaxation of these nuclear spins . Most subsequent theories have built on the ideas in this fundamental paper . In 1953 Wangsness and Bloch replaced the existing models with a rigorous quantum mechanical treatment [ 7 ] and ﬁnally Redﬁeld formu - lated the foundation of current nuclear relaxation theory for molecules in solution . [ 8 ] In this approach the lattice acts as a reservoir of inﬁnite heat capacity persistent in ther - mal equilibrium . The BWR formulation restrictively holds for fast motion and weak collision limits . In the fast motion limit , the correlation time of the motion τ c ( the cor - relation time τ c represents the time it takes for a molecule to reorient by one degree [ 9 ] ) has to be much shorter than T 1 and T 2 ; the weak collision limit incorporates that many collisions are required to change the orientation of the interaction tensor . Mostly , the description of macromolecular dynamics in solution satisﬁes these conditions . By themselves , nuclear spin relaxation rates are of little interest . Their importance lies in the information they convey about the molecular system . These nuclear spin relaxation rates provide information about the amplitudes and rates of molecular dy - namics . Measurements of relaxation rates are based on perturbing the spin systems away from their equilibrium states and then monitoring their return to equilibrium . 2 . 1 Protein Dynamics Function in biological systems exquisitely depends on spatial and temporal changes in biomacromolecules . Various biological processes rely on transduction of information through conformational changes in proteins and nucleic acids associated with folding and assembly , ligand binding and molecular recognition , and catalysis . NMR spec - troscopy oﬀers the unique ability to investigate dynamic properties of molecules over a range of diﬀerent time scales with atomic resolution ( Fig . 2 . 1 ) . 7 Chapter 2 Theoretical Aspects Figure 2 . 1 : Time scales for protein dynamics and NMR techniques . Protein motions and the established NMR techniques for studying these motions span more than 15 orders of magnitude in time scale . Many biologically relevant dynamics in proteins occur on microsecond to millisecond time scales and manifest as chemical exchange line broadening in NMR spectra . 2 . 1 . 1 Dynamics in the ps to ns Time Scale Conformational dynamics on time scales comparable to or faster than the overall rota - tional correlation times for biomacromolecules inﬂuence spin relaxation rate constants by modulating dipole - dipole interactions , chemical shift anisotropy , and quadrupolar Hamiltonians . The measurement of 15 N relaxation rates is particularly beneﬁcial to probe backbone motions because the relaxation of these nuclei is governed predomi - nantly by the dipolar interaction with directly bound protons and to a much smaller extent by the chemical shift anisotropy mechanism , [ 10 ] whereas the quadrupolar relax - ation mechanism does not play any role since this kind of relaxation is restricted to spins with I > 12 such as 2 H . [ 11 ] Analysis of rapid backbone motions in the ps to ns time scale requires T 1 , T 2 , and heteronuclear steady state NOE experiments ( Fig . 2 . 2 ) . [ 12 ] T 1 or T 2 values are extracted in a straightforward way by measuring the intensities of cross - peaks as a function of a relaxation delay , T . Fitting these exponential decays reveals the relaxation rates R 1 and R 2 , respectively for each analyzed spin . In contrast , the phenomenon of the steady state NOE is based on a rather exceptional eﬀect . Application of a weak radio frequency ﬁeld at the Larmor frequency of one spin for a suﬃciently long time strongly eﬀects the longitudinal magnetization of the non - irradiated spin ( Fig . 2 . 3 ) . This radio frequency ﬁeld equalizes the populations across the irradiated transitions and after a suﬃciently long interval of resonant irradiation the populations settle into steady state values . Saturation of the spin leads to perturbed energy level populations and thus the spin aims to reach the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution again . The necessary spin state transitions are caused by relaxation . Whereas relaxation of the saturated 8 2 . 1 Protein Dynamics Figure 2 . 2 : Schemes for the measurements of 15 N spin ( A ) T 1 , ( B ) T 2 , and ( C ) 1 H – 15 N NOE values . [ 12 ] The delay ∆ is adjusted to 1 / ( 4 J NH ) as well as the delay τ due to the relatively long transverse relaxation times for backbone 15 N spins . In order to measure R 1 or R 2 relaxation rates of the heterospin , two refocused INEPT - type sequences are employed to transfer magnetization from the directly bound proton to the low γ heteronucleus and back to proton for detection . T 1 or T 2 values are extracted in a straightforward way by measuring the intensities of cross - peaks as a function of the relaxation delay , T . Spectra for measuring 1 H – 15 N NOEs are recorded in the presence and absence of 1 H saturation . Narrow and wide bars represent 90 ◦ and 180 ◦ pulses , respectively . 9 Chapter 2 Theoretical Aspects Figure 2 . 3 : Schematic representation of irradiated transitions in the steady state NOE experiment . After a suﬃcient amount of time without any disturbance , a coupled spin ensemble adopts a state of thermal equilibrium with respect to the molecular environment . In the case of a continuous radio frequency ﬁeld at the I spin Larmor frequency , this irradiation induces transitions across two pairs of energy levels . The populations across these irradiated transitions equalize after a suﬃciently long interval of resonant irradiation . These varied populations also eﬀect the S spin magnetization compared to its thermal equilibrium value by a factor ε NOE . This NOE enhancement factor can be calculated according to ε NOE = 1 + γ I γ S ( W 2 − W 0 ) W 0 + 2 W 1 S + W 2 , where W i denotes the transition probability between the energy levels of the associated states . [ 9 ] spin via the W 1 mechanism has no eﬀect on nearby spins , the mechanisms W 0 and W 2 however cause the so far unperturbed spins to deviate from their Boltzmann equilibrium towards diﬀerent populations of the α and β states ( Fig . 2 . 3 ) . This dipolar cross - relaxation alters the longitudinal magnetization compared to its thermal equilibrium state resulting in an increase or decrease of the magnetization . The change in signal intensity depends on the correlation time and the gyromagnetic ratio of the interacting spins . In the case of very rapid molecular motions the 15 N magnetization changes sign when the 1 H spins are saturated . Whereas in the case of slow molecular motions the signal intensity of the 15 N spins remains more or less equal to the reference experiment without the saturation . These relaxation data ( T 1 , T 2 , and heteronuclear steady state NOE ) contain the in - formation concerning the nature of internal motions that occur in the system under investigation . The simplest possible description of these internal dynamics involves specifying the rate ( time scale ) and the spatial restriction of the motion of the 15 N – H vectors . [ 13 ] Because of intrachain and interchain interactions , the vector cannot adopt all possible orientations . Consequently , the backbone atoms experience restricted mo - tions rather than isotropic motions . Lipari and Szabo developed a model free approach that allows complete characterization of the fast internal motions contained in NMR relaxation experiments by two independent quantities , a generalized order parameter , S , which represents the degree of spatial restriction of the motion , and an eﬀective correlation time , τ i , which describes the rate of reorientation . [ 13 , 14 ] 10 2 . 1 Protein Dynamics Figure 2 . 4 : Schematic illustration of the internal correlation time , τ i , and the overall correlation time , τ c . In both cases the correlation time τ presents the reorientation of the N – H vector as a function of time . However , τ i indicates the internal dynamics of each single N – H vector within the molecule , whereas it is assumed that the overall tumbling can be characterized by a single τ c value for all N – H vectors located within the molecule . Fluctuations of the 15 N – H vectors with respect to the external magnetic ﬁeld de - termine the relaxation of the nitrogen nucleus . This bond vector samples a variety of distinct orientations over the time , a motional process that is mathematically stated by a time dependent correlation function . The correlation function holds for spherical molecules and depends on the rotational correlation time ( τ c ) , a parameter that char - acterizes the rate of reorientation of the bond vector . Typically , large molecules exhibit sluggish motions and hence their correlation time is rather long as compared to small molecules that rotate quite fast . Assumed that the overall motion of a macromolecule can be described by a single correlation time and that the overall and internal motions are independent ( Fig . 2 . 4 ) , the total correlation function can be quantiﬁed as C ( t ) = C o ( t ) C i ( t ) ( 2 . 2 ) where the correlation function for the overall motion is C o ( t ) = 1 5 exp − t / τ c . ( 2 . 3 ) Assuming a spherical molecule , the simplest theoretical approach calculates the isotropic rotational correlation time from Stokes’ law τ c = 4 πη w r 3 hydro 3 k B T ( 2 . 4 ) with the viscosity of the solvent η w , the hydrodynamic radius of the molecule r hydro , the Boltzmann constant k B , and the temperature T . The internal correlation function 11 Chapter 2 Theoretical Aspects can be approximated by C i ( t ) = S 2 + (cid:0) 1 − S 2 (cid:1) exp − t / τ i ( 2 . 5 ) where τ i is the eﬀective correlation time and S 2 the generalized order parameter . A combination of equation 2 . 3 and 2 . 5 gives the total correlation function as C ( t ) = 1 5 S 2 exp − t / τ c + 1 5 (cid:0) 1 − S 2 (cid:1) exp − t / τ ( 2 . 6 ) with τ − 1 = τ − 1 c + τ − 1 i ( 2 . 7 ) and subsequently Fourier transformation results in the corresponding spectral density function J ( ω ) = 2 5 (cid:20) S 2 τ c 1 + ( ωτ c ) 2 + ( 1 − S 2 ) τ 1 + ( ωτ ) 2 (cid:21) . ( 2 . 8 ) Although this simple two parameter model free approach emerged as remarkably successful in the interpretation of the relaxation data ( T 1 , T 2 , and HetNOE ) , occasional discrepancy in the attempt to determine a single parameter set ( S 2 , τ i ) for certain spins indicates that the evaluation of these relaxation experiments must additionally account for slow components . [ 15 ] Hence , the correlation function for the internal motions has to be expanded to accommodate at least two parameters , the slow correlation time τ s in the order of 1 - 3 ns that is still faster than the overall rotational correlation time ( around 10 ns for medium size proteins in aqueous solution at room temperature ) and the fast correlation time τ f that reﬂects the fast random motions . Assuming that the fast internal motions are independent of the slow motions and diﬀer by at least one order of magnitude , the total generalized order parameter can be decomposed as S 2 = S 2 f S 2 s . ( 2 . 9 ) Furthermore , since in the majority of cases τ f is suﬃciently small resulting in negli - gible contribution to the relaxation parameters , the spectral density function can be described by J ( ω ) = 2 5 (cid:20) S 2 τ c 1 + ( ωτ c ) 2 + ( S 2 f − S 2 ) τ ′ s 1 + ( ωτ ′ s ) 2 (cid:21) ( 2 . 10 ) with τ ′ s = τ s τ c τ s + τc . ( 2 . 11 ) The T 1 and T 2 relaxation times and the NOE enhancement of an amide 15 N spin , taking only dipolar and chemical shift anisotropy interactions as sources of relaxation into account , are related to the spectral density function by [ 16 ] R 1 = T − 1 1 = d 2 4 [ J ( ω H − ω N ) + 3 J ( ω N ) + 6 J ( ω H + ωN ) ] + c 2 J ( ω N ) ( 2 . 12 ) 12 2 . 1 Protein Dynamics Figure 2 . 5 : Schematic representation of the squared order parameter S 2 and the internal correlation time τ i . According to the model free approach , internal dynamics of the molecule on the ps to ns time scale can be characterized by the spatial restriction ( S 2 ) and the rate ( τ i ) of the motion of the N – H vector . R 2 = T − 1 2 = d 2 8 [ 4 J ( 0 ) + J ( ω H − ω N ) + 3 J ( ω N ) + 6 J ( ω H ) + 6 J ( ω H + ω N ) ] + c 2 6 [ 4 J ( 0 ) + 3 J ( ω N ) ] ( 2 . 13 ) NOE = 1 + d 2 4 R 1 γ N γ H [ 6 J ( ω H + ω N ) − J ( ω H − ω N ) ] ( 2 . 14 ) in which d = µ 0 hγ N γ H r − 3 NH / ( 8 π 2 ) , c = ω N ∆ σ / √ 3 , µ 0 is the permeability of vacuum ; h is the Planck’s constant ; γ H and γ N are the gyromagnetic ratios of 1 H and the 15 N spin , respectively ; r NH is the N – H bond length ; ω H and ω N are the Larmor frequencies of 1 H and the 15 N spin , respectively ; J ( ω H ) and J ( ω N ) are the spectral density functions of 1 H and the 15 N spin , respectively ; and ∆ σ is the chemical shift anisotropy of the 15 N spin ( assuming an axially symmetric chemical shift tensor ) . Based on these equations , software packages like the program Modelfree by Arthur Palmer analyze the relaxation data by ﬁtting the extended model free spectral density function to the experimental NMR spin relaxation data . [ 17 , 18 ] These simulated spectral density functions are optimized by varying the model free parameters , the generalized order parameter S 2 and the internal correlation time τ i . These parameters provide information about the spatial restriction of the motion of the bond vector ( S 2 ) and also about the rate of reorientation of this vector ( τ i ) for each analyzed spin ( Fig . 2 . 5 ) . S 2 adopts values between 0 for isotropic internal motions according to equally probable orientations through the entire conformational space and 1 for completely restricted motions . 2 . 1 . 2 Dynamics in the µ s to ms Time Scale Molecular motions on time scales slower than the overall rotational correlation times ( τ c ) for biomacromolecules are of particular interest because functionally important biological processes , including enzyme catalysis , signal transduction , ligand binding , and allosteric regulation occur in this time regime . [ 19 ] Motions on µ s - ms time scales cause spin relaxation resulting from the modulation of isotropic chemical shifts by 13 Chapter 2 Theoretical Aspects altering the magnetic environments of the spins . The phenomenon of chemical exchange refers to any process in which the spins experience distinct magnetic environments . [ 20 ] Hence , chemical exchange provides information on conformational and kinetic processes in the time range slower than the overall molecular tumbling . The main experimental techniques for quantifying chemical exchange are longitudinal magnetization exchange , line shape analysis , and CPMG relaxation dispersion . The observation of two or more resonance signals for a single nuclear spin in the NMR spectrum of a protein and subsequent conﬁrmation with ZZ - exchange spectroscopy es - tablish the existence of chemical exchange on the slow exchange time scale . [ 21 ] Con - versely , studying slow chemical exchange processes by monitoring the exchange of longi - tudinal magnetization between distinct sites requires suﬃcient population of the minor sites of the exchange process in order to generate observable resonance signals . Fur - thermore , the exchange rate k ex must not be much less than the longitudinal relaxation rate constant in the absence of chemical exchange , otherwise the signals decay due to relaxation faster than population transfer . However in many cases , owing to skewed population distributions and selective line broadening of resonances for the minor pop - ulation , only one resonance corresponding to the major population is observed even for slow chemical exchange between multiple conformations or distinct magnetic environ - ments . [ 22 , 23 ] Therefore , for such sites in slow exchange and all sites in fast exchange experimental techniques are based on determining the contribution of chemical ex - change to the resonance linewidth or the transverse relaxation rate constant . Although resonance signals of sites experiencing chemical exchange display weakened intensity and broadened lineshapes , other factors such as amide proton exchange with the solvent and anisotropic global tumbling motion also reduce peak intensity and cause broadened lineshapes . Hence , chemical exchange is commonly characterized by measuring trans - verse relaxation rate constants rather than lineshapes . Sites in proteins that undergo chemical exchange can be identiﬁed by quantifying the chemical exchange contribution R ex to the transverse relaxation rate constant R 2 . This chemical exchange contribution R ex is given by R ex = R 2 − R 02 ( 2 . 15 ) where R 02 represents the relaxation rate constant in the absence of chemical exchange , due to dipole - dipole , chemical shift anisotropy , and quadrupole relaxation mechanisms . Exchange in the µ s - ms time regime results in enhanced transverse relaxation rates . This increase in the observed R 2 is caused by altered precessional frequencies of the nuclear spin associated with the chemical exchange between distinct sites and as a con - sequence the spin coherence dephases . Relaxation compensated Carr - Purcell - Meiboom - Gill ( CPMG ) sequences have proven particularly suitable in characterizing protein dy - namics on these time scales , as the implemented spin echo pulse trains can attenuate this kind of coherence loss . [ 24 , 25 ] In the case of a fast CPMG pulsing rate corresponding to a short time delay between the spin echo refocusing pulses , τ cp , relative to the mean lifetime of the exchange event , the chemical exchange has only a negligible eﬀect on the coherence dephasing and thus R 2 ∼ R 0 2 . Due to the diﬀerent time regimes , these 14 2 . 1 Protein Dynamics relaxation mechanisms on the ps - ns time scale still proceed . However , in the case the exchange events occur on the time scale of or faster than the repetition rate of the 180 ◦ pulses realized by a slow CPMG pulsing rate , the induced dephasing signiﬁcantly contributes to coherence loss which manifests in an elevated R 2 . In a two site exchange mechanism , a nuclear spin exchanges between sites a and b that diﬀer in chemical shift by ∆ ω = Ω a − Ω b . The kinetics of the exchange reaction are described by the apparent exchange rate constant k ex = k 1 + k − 1 , where k 1 and k − 1 are the ﬁrst order rate constants for the forward and reverse transitions , respectively . In the limit of fast exchange , k ex ≫ ∆ ω , the dependence of the measured transverse relaxation rate on the time delay between the spin echo refocusing pulses , τ cp , can be described by [ 26 ] R 2 ( 1 / τ cp ) = R 02 + Φ ex k ex (cid:20) 1 − 2 tanh ( k ex τ cp / 2 ) k ex τ cp (cid:21) ( 2 . 16 ) with Φ ex = ∆ ω 2 p a p b in which p i is the fractional population of the spin in site i and p a + p b = 1 . Alternatively to this fast limit equation , a completely general , albeit more complex expression for R 2 ( 1 / τ cp ) is given by R 2 ( 1 / τ cp ) = 1 2 (cid:18) R 2 a + R 2 b + k ex − 1 τ cp cosh − 1 [ D + cosh ( η + ) − D − cos ( η − ) ] (cid:19) ( 2 . 17 ) where D ± = 1 2 " ± 1 + ( Ψ + 2∆ ω 2 ) ( Ψ 2 + ζ 2 ) 12 # ( 2 . 18 ) η ± = τ cp √ 2 h ± Ψ + ( Ψ 2 + ζ 2 ) 12 i 12 ( 2 . 19 ) Ψ = ( R 2 a − R 2 b − p a k ex + p b k ex ) 2 − ∆ ω 2 + 4 p a p b k 2 ex ( 2 . 20 ) ζ = 2∆ ω ( R 2 a − R 2 b − p a k ex + p b k ex ) . ( 2 . 21 ) Typically , these CPMG pulse sequences are implemented in a constant time manner , meaning a constant relaxation delay T cp comprises a varying number of spin echo re - focusing pulses equivalent to varying time delays , τ cp , between these 180 ◦ pulses . The decay of R 2 ( 1 / τ cp ) as a function of 1 / τ cp can be ﬁtted to equation 2 . 17 by various software packages like Cpmgfit by Arthur Palmer . [ 28 ] Nuclear spins that display no dispersive behavior experience no chemical exchange , whereas chemically exchanging residues exhibit well deﬁned relaxation dispersion proﬁles which enable the extraction of the kinetic parameter k ex in addition to the thermodynamic parameters p a , p b , and ∆ ω . However , single ﬁeld measurements of these relaxation dispersion proﬁles can yield a signiﬁcant probability of erroneous parameters with a large deviation from physical reality . [ 27 ] As the relaxation curves depend on the static magnetic ﬁeld , acquisition of a second data set at a diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld strength increases the number of data for each nuclear spin and hence remarkably improves the analysis of the exchange process . 15 Chapter 2 Theoretical Aspects Figure 2 . 6 : Parameter dependence of relaxation dispersion curves . [ 27 ] Top : Dependence of R 2 ( τ cp ) on ∆ ω , with ∆ ω = 400 s − 1 ( red ) , ∆ ω = 700 s − 1 ( green ) , ∆ ω = 1500 s − 1 ( blue ) , and k ex = 1500 s − 1 , p a = 0 . 95 , and R 02 = 15 . 0 s − 1 . Middle : Inﬂuence of fractional conformer population on R 2 ( τ cp ) , where p a = 0 . 90 ( blue ) , p a = 0 . 95 ( green ) , p a = 0 . 98 ( red ) , and k ex = 1500 s − 1 , R 02 = 15 . 0 s − 1 , and ∆ ω = 1000 s − 1 . Bottom : Eﬀect of k ex on R 2 ( τ cp ) , with k ex = 500 s − 1 ( blue ) , k ex = 1000 s − 1 ( green ) , k ex = 1500 s − 1 ( red ) , and ∆ ω = 700 s − 1 , p a = 0 . 95 , and R 02 = 15 . 0 s − 1 . In this case of a two site exchange , the magnitude of R 2 ( τ cp ) is primarily determined by ∆ ω and p a , whereas the kinetics of exchange ( k ex ) have a more subtle eﬀect on the NMR data . However , since all of these parameters contribute to the relaxation dispersion proﬁle of each spin and as equation 2 . 17 clearly indicates , analysis of these CPMG curves is quite complex . 16 2 . 2 Amide Proton Exchange This ﬁeld dependence is predominantly caused by ∆ ω that can just be scaled to the dis - tinct magnetic ﬁelds due to its linear ﬁeld dependence . Additionally , R 02 shows a small ﬁeld dependence owing to the 15 N chemical shift anisotropy . [ 27 ] Thus , ﬁtting the various relaxation dispersion proﬁles acquired at two diﬀerent static magnetic ﬁelds allows an unambiguous estimation of the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters . Although the majority of exchange processes justiﬁes the assumption of a two site exchange mech - anism , some exchange events require a three site mechanism . Therefore , established software packages also oﬀer the possibility of analyzing the dispersion data by a linear three site exchange model . In the case a nuclear spin exchanges between distinct sites , the contribution of the chemical exchange to the transverse relaxation rate constant is of course also present in the analysis of the dynamics in the ps - ns time scale . Hence , the software Modelfree accounts for the chemical exchange , but also for all other dynamical processes on the slow time scale , by including an additional term into the algorithm if the simulated relaxation data diﬀer from the experimental ones . This exchange broadening parameter is scaled quadratically with respect to the static magnetic ﬁeld provided that data for more than one ﬁeld are available . Since relaxation of protonated 15 N heteronuclei is dominated by dipolar interactions with the directly bonded 1 H spins , fast internal motions monitored by 15 N – 1 H relaxation experiments are approximately independent of the static magnetic ﬁeld strengths , thus observed variations in the relaxation data on the fast time scale at diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds indicate slow internal motions . 2 . 2 Amide Proton Exchange Characterization of conformational dynamics in biological macromolecules is not nec - essarily restricted to the investigation of spin relaxation , but can also be studied by amide proton exchange and residual dipolar coupling constants . Measurement of the hydrogen exchange rates additionally provides information about the dynamical features of the protein . Whereas the classical H – D exchange cannot resolve rates faster than the time required for the acquisition of a two dimensional NMR spectrum , the so - called Mexico pulse sequence enables the determination of fast amide proton exchange rates in the range of milliseconds to seconds . [ 29 ] This experiment takes advantage of quantifying build - up rates of signals that are caused by the exchange process itself . For this purpose , all contributions from the natural Boltzmann magnetization of the amide protons have to be ﬁltered out prior to the acquisition of the actual experiment . After quantitative suppression of all protons attached to nitrogen and carbon , the water protons are turned back onto the z axis and during the subsequent mixing time exchange of z magnetization from the water protons to the amide protons occurs . The build - up of z magnetization of the amide protons depends on their exchange rate with the water protons and also on the mixing time of the pulse sequence . Finally , the established z magnetization of the amide protons can be detected by a standard HSQC experiment . Analyzing the peak intensity as 17 Chapter 2 Theoretical Aspects Figure 2 . 7 : Summary of the motionally averaged spin interactions and their rough relative magni - tudes in diﬀerent phases of matter . In the special case of isotropic solution the largest internal terms average to zero . In addition , the quadrupolar coupling always vanishes for spin - 12 nuclei independent of the phase of matter . a function of the mixing time reveals the exchange rate k ex . In order to minimize NOE eﬀects that will also occur during the mixing time , both the nitrogen and the carbon bound protons have to be saturated prior to the mixing time . Appropriate pulse schemes are able to ﬁlter nitrogen and carbon bound protons , [ 30 ] however this clearly requires uniformly 15 N and 13 C labeled protein samples . For only 15 N labeled proteins , the NOE between amide protons and carbon bound protons also contributes to the resonance signal intensity and hence leads to inaccurate exchange rates . 2 . 3 Residual Dipolar Couplings A nuclear spin experiences various electric and magnetic ﬁelds of distinct origin . Spin interactions of external origin correspond to the static magnetic ﬁeld and the applied radio frequency ﬁeld . Spin interactions of internal origin include indirect magnetic in - teraction of the external magnetic ﬁeld and the nuclear spin through the involvement of electrons ( chemical shift term ) , electric interaction of the nuclear spin with the sur - rounding electric ﬁelds ( quadrupolar coupling ) , direct magnetic interactions of nuclear spins with each other ( direct dipole - dipole coupling ) , indirect magnetic interactions of nuclear spins with each other through the involvement of electrons ( J coupling ) ( Fig . 2 . 7 ) . The dipole - dipole coupling does not involve any electrons and might be ei - ther intramolecular or intermolecular . The magnitude of this through space interaction 18 2 . 3 Residual Dipolar Couplings Figure 2 . 8 : Schematic representation of the dependence of RDC values on the orientation of the internuclear vector and the alignment tensor . The measured coupling can be described in terms of the orientation of the interspin vector by the angles Θ and Φ in the frame of the alignment tensor , given by A xx , A yy , A zz . These orientations of the interdipolar vector are plotted on the surface as a function of the range of couplings . is given by the dipole - dipole coupling constant D = − γ I γ S ~ µ 0 8 π 2 r 3 (cid:0) 3 cos 2 Θ − 1 (cid:1) ( 2 . 22 ) where Θ represents the angle between the vector joining the interacting spins and the external magnetic ﬁeld and r the spin - spin distance . Apart from these parameters the coupling constant only depends on physical constants : the gyromagnetic ratios γ I and γ S of spin I and S , respectively , the Planck constant ~ , and the permeability of vacuum µ 0 . This dipole - dipole interaction decreases with the inverse cube of the in - ternuclear distance and scales linearly with the gyromagnetic ratio of the interacting spins . Furthermore , it depends on the molecular orientation . According to equation 2 . 22 the dipole - dipole coupling constant has opposite signs for spin pairs aligned along the ﬁeld ( Θ = 0 ) compared to spin pairs oriented perpendicular to the ﬁeld ( Θ = π / 2 ) and equals to zero at an angle of ≈ 54 . 74 ◦ . In an isotropic liquid intramolecular dipole - dipole couplings average to zero , due to equal probabilities of all molecular ori - entations . Similarly , the short range intermolecular dipole - dipole couplings average to zero , because of the translational motion of the molecule . Although the long range intermolecular dipole - dipole couplings survive the motional averaging , these couplings are negligible . Even though the internuclear magnetic dipole couplings average out completely in isotropic solution , their eﬀect on nuclear spin relaxation results in mea - surable NOEs . In contrast , in an anisotropic liquid the intramolecular dipole - dipole couplings do not average out due to the preferential molecular orientation . Whereas the intermolecular interactions behave the same , owing to the still existing translational motion of the molecules . 19 Chapter 2 Theoretical Aspects The non - isotropic orientational averaging of the molecule can be described in terms of an alignment tensor . The orientation of the alignment tensor with respect to the coordinate frame of the molecule can in return be deﬁned simply via a three dimensional Euler rotation R ( α , β , γ ) . The measured dipolar coupling corresponds to the orientation of the internuclear spin vector ( speciﬁed by the angles Θ and Φ ) in the frame of the alignment tensor , with its values A xx , A yy , and A zz ( Fig . 2 . 8 ) . These values reﬂect the deviation from the isotropic probability distribution of the x , y , and z axes of the alignment tensor frame to be parallel to B 0 ( A xx + A yy + A zz = 0 ) . For instance , for an isotropically reorienting molecule the probabilities would be A xx = A yy = A zz = 0 and for a fully aligned molecule A xx = A yy = − 13 , A zz = 23 ; where by convention | A xx | ≤ | A yy | ≤ | A zz | . Therefore , the equation for the dipolar coupling constant in a weakly anisotropic solution has to be rewritten as D ( Θ , Φ ) = D a (cid:2) ( 3 cos 2 Θ − 1 ) + R sin 2 Θ cos 2Φ (cid:3) ( 2 . 23 ) where D a = D max A zz with D max = − γ I γ S ~ µ 0 8 π 2 r 3 and R = A xx − A yy A zz . D a refers to the magnitude of the dipolar coupling tensor , commonly normalized to the N – H dipolar interaction , and R represents the rhombicity . Altogether , ﬁve parameters characterize the alignment tensor ( D a , R , α , β , γ ) . These parameters can be determined directly via singular value decomposition from a set of at least ﬁve RDCs for any known structure . In order to permit facile measurement of dipolar interactions it is essential that these interactions are still averaged to a very small fraction ( typically ∼ 10 − 3 ) of their static value . [ 31 ] Several alignment media such as bicelles , [ 31 ] ﬁlamentous phage Pf1 , [ 32 ] and polyacrylamide gels [ 33 ] enable the partial orientation of macromolecules to a relatively small degree . This weak alignment still allows the molecules to diﬀuse freely resulting in narrow resonances in the spectra , but on the other hand limits the measurement of dipolar couplings to the largest interactions , such as one bond 15 N – 1 H , 13 C – 1 H , 13 C – 13 C . For directly bonded pairs of atoms , the internuclear distance is accurately known and hence the measured dipolar coupling provides information on the relative orientation of the internuclear bond vector . Since the establishment of these alignment media that permit the measurement of dipolar couplings while retaining high quality spectra , residual dipolar couplings have evolved into an inherent part in structural and dynamic characterization of biomolecules in solution . The provided information on the biomolecular conformation is incorporated into structure reﬁnement , fold determination , and quaternary structure determination of proteins . In addition , in terms of molecular dynamics residual dipolar couplings have also proven to be of particular beneﬁt . RDCs are averages over all interspin orienta - tions of the dipolar interaction that are sampled up to the time scale deﬁned by the inverse of the alignment induced coupling and consequently report on averages over relatively long time scales ( up to and beyond the millisecond range ) . Measurement of these couplings therefore encodes key information for understanding protein motions on time scales that are highly complementary to the dynamic picture derived from spin relaxation experiments . Although it is in principle possible to derive this valuable 20 2 . 3 Residual Dipolar Couplings Figure 2 . 9 : Extracting dipolar coupling constants by comparing line splittings in isotropic ( blue ) and anisotropic ( red ) solution . These splittings display representative examples for positive and negative residual dipolar couplings corresponding to an orientation rather along the z axis of the alignment tensor frame and respectively rather perpendicular to this axis . In this case , the partial alignment of the USH - I / LWEQ domain of talin was achieved by non - ionic liquid crystalline media and RDC values were extracted from IPAP - HNCO experiments without decoupling during acquisition . information and several studies demonstrate its remarkable potential , the other side of the coin is the immense amount of data needed for this comprehensive analysis . [ 34 – 37 ] Figure 2 . 8 indicates that a certain dipolar coupling corresponds to an entire cone of Θ , Φ solutions . Whereas for applications like structure reﬁnement the identiﬁcation of this cone is already suﬃcient to validate the determined structure , the characterization of the motional averaging of each individual vector requires precise knowledge of its orientation . This detailed description of the vector orientation necessitates ﬁve indepen - dent RDC values , corresponding to ﬁve independent alignment media . Because of the impossible prediction of linearly independent alignment media , this dynamic analysis represents a quite extensive method to characterize backbone motions on the ms time scale , even though protein dynamics in this time regime are of particular importance for biologically relevant processes . 21 Chapter 3 The Antibody Domain C L Explains Diﬀerences in Ig Amyloidogenicity Prerequisite for the astonishing diversity and selectivity in biochemical processes of living systems is the capacity of even the most intricate molecular structures to self assemble with remarkable precision . During evolution proteins might be predominantly optimized for functional purposes rather than for most eﬀective folding which compro - mises both the speed of folding and the native state stability . [ 38 ] This evolutionary pressure for function over folding increases the risk of oﬀ - pathway events such as pro - tein misfolding and aggregation . In general , all proteins transiently populate partially folded species on their pathway to the native state suggesting that these intermediates enhance the folding eﬃciency considerably . [ 39 ] However , impaired speed of folding leads to persistently populated intermediates that are particularly susceptible to misfolding and misassembly reactions . Since the properties of the folding intermediate essentially determine whether a protein folds robustly or has the tendency to misfold , structural characterization of folding intermediates and thus understanding of protein folding in general is one of the great challenges of modern science . Yet , due to their transient nature , folding intermediates are poorly accessible to high resolution techniques . The intrinsically slow folding reaction of the antibody domain C L enables a detailed investigation of its major folding intermediate . Furthermore , trapping the intermedi - ate in equilibrium by a single point mutation allowed its structural characterization at atomic resolution . NMR experiments in combination with molecular dynamics simula - tions provide a precise picture of the major C L folding intermediate . For the core region of this protein , the typical β - barrel topology is well established , yet some edge strands are distorted and hence adopt a variety of conformations . Surprisingly , two short strand connecting helices conserved in constant antibody domains assume their com - pletely native structure already in the intermediate . Thus , these helical elements might 23 Chapter 3 The C L Domain Explains Differences in Ig Amyloidogenicity provide a scaﬀold for adjacent strands and assist in the formation of the hydrophobic core . Since the constant antibody domains have never been directly associated with amyloidogenic diseases , these helices might prevent harmful misfolding reactions . In - terestingly , the variable antibody domain ( V L ) and β 2 - microglobulin ( β 2 m ) are highly homologous members of the same superfamily but their partially folded intermediate states are prone to amyloid formation . Remarkably , neither amyloidogenic protein possesses the short strand connecting helices . To verify the theory that these helical elements promote robust folding , the unstructured loop regions in β 2 m were exchanged against the corresponding helical elements of the C L domain . Indeed , this modiﬁcation signiﬁcantly reduces the propensity of β 2 m to form amyloids . Thus , a high degree of local structuring in a protein folding intermediate can shape the folding landscape de - cisively to favor either folding or misfolding . Furthermore , minor structural diﬀerences between members of the same protein superfamily can lead to avoidance of pathogenic misfolding reactions while preserving an identical protein topology . 3 . 1 Introduction 3 . 1 . 1 The Antibody Molecule Immunoglobulin G Already more than 100 years ago Paul Ehrlich proposed a remarkably modern model for an antibody molecule . [ 40 ] According to this model , antibody molecules can be described as highly ﬂexible receptors located at the surface of the cell . In the case these receptors recognize any toxic molecule , they bind the pathogen and initiate the production of additional antibody molecules . The cell only generates the type of receptor that is speciﬁc for the bound toxic molecule and transports the antibodies to the extracellular matrix . As the free receptors still possess the capacity to bind the pathogen , they are able to protect the cell against any further attack . This model also includes the concept of complementarity in antibody - antigen recognition , consistent with the ’lock and key’ ﬁt proposed by Fischer for enzymes . [ 41 ] In the last century notable eﬀort has been made to gain more precise insights into the molecular mechanism of the immune response resulting in a detailed knowledge of function and structure of antibody molecules . To eﬀectively ﬁght the wide range of pathogens , lymphocytes have evolved to rec - ognize a great variety of diﬀerent antigens from bacteria , viruses , and other disease causing organisms . Two types of lymphocytes exist , B cells and T cells , each with quite diﬀerent roles in the immune system and distinct antigen receptors . The anti - gen recognizing molecules of B cells are immunoglobulins ( Ig ) . Each B cell produces immunoglobulin molecules of a single speciﬁcity which are bound to the membrane on the cell surface and serve as a receptor for antigen recognition . After encounter with an antigen , B cells diﬀerentiate into antibody secreting plasma cells . The antigen recognizing molecules of T cells are solely membrane bound proteins . These T cell receptors are related to immunoglobulins , however in contrast to the B cell receptors they recognize short peptide fragments of the antigens which are often buried within 24 3 . 1 Introduction Figure 3 . 1 : Schematic illustration of an antibody molecule . The Y shaped immunoglobulin G consists of two light chains ( depicted in orange ) and two heavy chains ( colored in blue ) . Recognition of antigens takes place in the Fab region whereas the Fc region engages various elimination mechanisms . the antigen molecule . Infected cells degrade foreign antigens and subsequently present the resulting peptides at the cell surface by specialized glycoproteins - the MHC ( ma - jor histocompatibility complex ) molecules . In this case it is a complex of the degraded peptide fragment and the MHC molecule on the surface of the cells that is recognized by the T cell receptors . After encounter with the antigen peptide fragment , T cells diﬀerentiate into one of several diﬀerent functional types of eﬀector T cells . These activated T cells mainly focus on killing of cells which are infected with viruses or other intracellular pathogens , activation of antigen stimulated B cells to diﬀerentiate and produce antibodies , and regulation of the activity of other lymphocytes to con - trol immune response . The secreted antibody molecule from the B cells has to fulﬁll distinct functions , binding speciﬁcally to molecules from the pathogen and recruiting other cells and molecules that destroy the pathogen once the antibody is bound to it . Recognition and eﬀector functions are structurally separated in the antibody molecule ( Fig . 3 . 1 ) . The antigen binding region varies extensively between antibody molecules and is therefore known as the variable region which allows each antibody to bind a diﬀerent speciﬁc antigen . Altogether the total repertoire of antibodies of a single indi - vidual is large enough to ensure that virtually any structure can be recognized . The part of the antibody molecule that engages the various eﬀector mechanisms is rela - tively conserved and hence termed the constant region . The diﬀerent eﬀector functions are deﬁned by the structure of the heavy chains of the antibody molecule . According to the number of heavy chain domains , the amount and location of disulﬁde bonds , and the distribution of linked carbohydrate groups , antibodies can be divided into ﬁve major classes : immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) , immunoglobulin D ( IgD ) , immunoglobulin G 25 Chapter 3 The C L Domain Explains Differences in Ig Amyloidogenicity Figure 3 . 2 : Cartoon representation of immunoglobulin G ( pdb 1igt ) . This heterotetrameric glyco - protein is made up of a series of immunoglobulin domains . C H 3 ( brown ) , C H 2 ( red ) , C H 1 ( orange ) , and V H ( yellow ) form the heavy chain and C L ( dark blue ) and V L ( light blue ) represent the light chain . ( IgG ) , immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) , and immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) . [ 42 ] Immunoglobulin G is the predominant antibody in the human serum and the most abundant therapeutic antibody . The immunoglobulin G molecule is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein assembled from two heavy chains and two light chains [ 43 ] which are covalently linked via disulﬁde bridges . [ 44 , 45 ] Each chain is composed of a series of structurally almost identical com - pact immunoglobulin domains . The immunoglobulin domains belonging to the constant region of the antibody molecule are named constant domain of the light chain C L and constant domain of the heavy chain C H 1 , C H 2 , C H 3 , respectively . Whereas the im - munoglobulin domains which are part of the variable region of the antibody molecule are called variable domain of the light chain V L and variable domain of the heavy chain V H , respectively . The three dimensional structure of this antibody molecule adopts a Y shape and consists of three independent protein moieties which are connected through a ﬂexible linker or hinge region ( Fig . 3 . 2 ) . [ 46 – 49 ] Two of these moieties are identical and include the antigen speciﬁc binding site , the third comprises interaction sites for ligands that activate the distinct eﬀector mechanisms . [ 50 , 51 ] The hinge region enables segmental ﬂexibility , hence each Fab region can bind an antigen while the Fc region remains accessible to eﬀector ligands . [ 52 ] 26 3 . 1 Introduction Figure 3 . 3 : Cartoon representation of the glycosylated homodimer of the immunoglobulin domain C H 2 . This illustration highlights the exclusive interaction of the C H 2 domains by its sugar moieties , consistent with deglycosylation of this domain leading to monomeric C H 2 . [ 53 ] The IgG - Fc region is a glycosylated homodimer of two immunoglobulin domains ( C H 2 , C H 3 ) that dimerizes via inter - heavy chain disulﬁde bridges at the N - terminal hinge region and due to non - covalent interactions between the C H 3 domains . In con - trast to the C H 3 domain , the C H 2 domain does not show any interchain protein - protein contacts , but solely interacts with the second C H 2 domain by its sugar moi - eties ( Fig . 3 . 3 ) . [ 45 ] The structure of the attached ’core’ heptasaccharide GlcNAc - GlcNAc - Man - ( Man - GlcNAc ) 2 reveals branching oligosaccharide arms at the ﬁrst man - nose residue . Besides , the oligosaccharide chain may be extended by an additional fucose residue at the primary GlcNAc and an additional galactose residue at the ﬁnal GlcNAc of each arm . [ 54 – 57 ] The sugar molecules of the oligosaccharide trunk together with one branching arm make multiple non - covalent interactions with the surface of the C H 2 domain , predominantly through hydrophobic amino acid residues . Whereas the second arm of the oligosaccharide chain extends towards the opposite C H 2 domain and interacts with its corresponding sugar moiety . [ 44 , 45 ] Complete deglycosylation of the C H 2 domain abolishes the capacity of the Fc region to bind ligands [ 58 – 60 ] and as a consequence the antibody molecule fails to initiate the corresponding eﬀector mech - anisms . [ 61 ] Since direct contact between the oligosaccharide and the ligand is not es - sential for the formation of the complex that activates the eﬀector mechanisms , the sugar moiety has to fulﬁll a spacer function to hold both C H 2 domains apart . Recent studies have shown that truncation of the oligosaccharide results in a closer approach of the C H 2 domains which then need to undergo conformational rearrangements prior to ligand binding . [ 53 , 62 , 63 ] As all glycoproteins consist of an ensemble of diﬀerent oligosac - charides attached to a common peptide , immunoglobulins also possess a distinct array 27 Chapter 3 The C L Domain Explains Differences in Ig Amyloidogenicity Figure 3 . 4 : Cartoon representation of the heterodimer of the immunoglobulin variable domains V H ( yellow ) and V L ( light blue ) with their hypervariable regions ( depicted in red ) . of carbohydrates at a conserved position in the constant region of the heavy chain . Superposition of diﬀerent IgG - Fc glycoform structures indicates that the C H 3 domains adopt a relatively rigid homodimeric structure whereas the position of the C H 2 domains varies with the distinct oligosaccharides and hence aﬀects protein assembly , secretion and functional activity . [ 53 , 57 ] However , before the Fc region of the antibody molecule triggers any eﬀector mechanism , foreign macromolecules have to be recognized and bound by the Fab region . The Fab region is composed of the complete light chain ( V L and C L ) paired with the two N - terminal domains of the heavy chain ( V H and C H 1 ) . [ 64 , 65 ] Association of the two polypeptide chains is based on non - covalent interactions between both the variable domains and the constant domains of each chain . [ 66 ] Furthermore , a disulﬁde bridge at the C - termini of the C L domain and the C H 1 domain connects both chains covalently . For the antigen binding activity of the Fab region , eﬀective assembly of the two chains is required , [ 66 , 67 ] even though crystallographic analyses of several antibody - antigen com - plexes have shown that antigen binding primarily takes place at the N - terminal tip of the Fab fragment . [ 68 – 70 ] The variable domains that are responsible for the antigen bind - ing have the same overall topology and the same conserved framework structure like the constant domains , but in addition they possess hypervariable regions . On the basis of sequence variations , the residues in the variable domains are assigned to the framework regions or to hypervariable regions respectively complementarity - determining regions ( CDRs ) . [ 71 ] Each of the variable domains has three of this complementarity - determining regions which cluster together and form a continuous hypervariable surface ( Fig . 3 . 4 ) . The variability in sequence and size of the CDRs causes a large diversity of the topog - raphy of this surface . Therefore , the speciﬁcity and aﬃnity of the binding sites for the huge variety of distinct antigens are governed by the structure of the six CDRs each of varied size and shape which are embedded into a scaﬀold of conserved sequence and structure . [ 71 , 72 ] To understand the molecular mechanism of antigen binding , several structures of Fab regions with speciﬁcally bound ligands have been elucidated by X - ray diﬀraction . [ 68 – 70 ] Experimental evidence indicates that the relationship between amino 28 3 . 1 Introduction acid sequence and structure of the binding site can be described by a canonical model , at least for ﬁve of the six hypervariable loops . [ 73 – 76 ] In this model , antibodies have only a few main chain conformations or canonical structures for each hypervariable region . Most variations in sequence alter the CDR surface constituted by the side chains , while the canonical main chain structure remains . Only a few changes in sequence at spe - ciﬁc positions result in a diﬀerent main chain conformation . [ 77 ] However , this model is not applicable for the most variable CDR within the V H domain . As this loop varies signiﬁcantly in length with very diﬀerent sequences and patterns of interaction , a clear relationship between sequence and structure was not detectable . [ 74 ] Still , already the earliest studies of antibody structures illustrated that all antibody domains , whether constant or variable , form compact globular structures with a char - acteristic fold , named the immunoglobulin fold by Poljak and coworkers . [ 78 ] 3 . 1 . 2 The Immunoglobulin Fold It is well known that three dimensional structures are much more conserved in evolution than sequences . A comprehensive structural and sequence comparison revealed that a common topology of fold can be achieved by fundamentally diﬀerent sequences . [ 79 – 82 ] Even so , the occurrence in nature and diversity in terms of biological activity of mem - bers of the immunoglobulin fold is quite impressive . The immunoglobulin like fold is one of the nine proposed superfolds that is adopted by distantly related proteins or evolutionary unrelated proteins with no sequence ho - mology . [ 83 ] Domains with an immunoglobulin like fold can be divided into superfam - ilies in which the sequence and structural similarity between members suggests that a common evolutionary origin is possible . Within these superfamilies domains may be grouped again into families in which either sequence or functional and structural similarities imply that a common evolutionary origin is very likely . [ 84 , 85 ] The class of immunoglobulin like β - sandwich proteins includes several superfamilies , amongst oth - ers immunoglobulin , integrin domains , transcription factor , and hemocyanin . However , the immunoglobulin superfamily comprises by far the greatest number of members and is itself grouped again into families ( Fig . 3 . 5 ) . Originally , the immunoglobulin super - family consisted of three subtypes , namely V set domains ( antibody variable domain like ) , C1 set domains ( antibody constant domain like ) , and C2 set domains ( CD2 , CD4 , cell adhesion molecules ) . [ 84 ] In the meantime , the increasing number of structures of immunoglobulin like domains has identiﬁed new families , including subtype I , C3 , C4 , and Fn3 . [ 86 , 87 ] The topology of the immunoglobulin fold has been described as a greek key β - barrel [ 88 ] composed of 7 - 9 β - strands , distributed between two sheets with typical topol - ogy and connectivity . Structural alignment of domains adopting the immunoglobulin fold reveals a common structural core which consists of only four β - strands ( b , c , e , and f ) . [ 89 ] These structurally conserved core strands are embedded in an antiparallel β - sheet sandwich with three to ﬁve additional strands ( a , c ’ , c ” , d , g ) . The position of the additional edge strands varies relative to the common core depending on the 29 Chapter 3 The C L Domain Explains Differences in Ig Amyloidogenicity Figure 3 . 5 : Structural tree of the immunoglobulin fold . Meanwhile , the immunoglobulin superfamily comprises several distinct families ( V , C1 , C2 , I , C3 , C4 , and Fn3 ) . Proteins investigated in this study all belong to the subtype C1 ( antibody constant domain like ) . 30 3 . 1 Introduction Figure 3 . 6 : Topology diagrams of observed hydrogen patterns of the immunoglobulin fold . The 7 - 9 β - strands form a sandwich of 2 sheets ( back sheet thin arrows ; front sheet thick arrows ) . The common core is shown in red . Immunoglobulin constant domains consist of 7 β - strands in a topology displayed at the bottom left ( c - type ) . Immunoglobulin variable domains have an additional hairpin between strands c and d , with a total of 9 β - strands ( v - type ) . Strand a can adopt two alternative positions in the v - type domains . Other immunoglobulin like domains also consist of 7 β - strands , but diﬀer from c - type in the 4th strand which has switched sheets ( s - type ) . The last type represents an 8 - stranded hybrid between c - and s - type that possesses both strands d and c , so each sheet is composed of 4 β - strands ( h - type ) . length of the intervening sequence between strands c and e , the most variable region in sequence . Based on the variation in the position of the edge strands , four diﬀerent topological subtypes can be distinguished ( Fig . 3 . 6 ) . [ 89 ] Generally , it is assumed that two polypeptide chains fold very similar if they share at least 30 % sequence identity . [ 90 , 91 ] The sequence identity between most members of the immunoglobulin fold is far below this threshold , but still the fold is remarkably similar . [ 87 , 89 ] Several studies indicate that not only the sequence but also the overall amino acid composition inﬂuences the folding pattern of a protein . [ 92 , 93 ] Some of the positions of a particular fold are always occupied by hydrophobic amino acids which are key residues constituting the common core and responsible for maintenance of the fold . [ 94 ] In the case of the immunoglobulin fold only position c 3 is hydrophobic within the complete superfamily , at positions b 1 and e 5 hydrophobic amino acids are present in more than 75 % of the sequences , at position f 5 only in 67 % of the sequences ( Fig . 3 . 7 ) . [ 87 ] This low conservation of speciﬁc amino acids clearly illustrates the great diversity of this superfamily and the necessity for speciﬁc interactions that stabilize the folded domains . Besides the formation of a typical hydrophobic core coded by 31 Chapter 3 The C L Domain Explains Differences in Ig Amyloidogenicity Figure 3 . 7 : Sequence alignment of the distinct domains of immunoglobulin G . The alignment is based on the regular secondary structures and generated with the software Jalview . [ 95 ] This multiple alignment editor also calculates the conservation ( an index reﬂecting the conservation of physiochem - ical properties ) , the quality ( the quality score indicates the likelihood of observing mutations ) , and the consensus ( an index representing the most common residue ) of the analyzed sequences . For the immunoglobulin G domains , identical residues are found at positions b 3 , c 5 , and f 3 . In addition , positions a 3 , b 1 , c 3 , e 5 , and f 1 are occupied by hydrophobic residues . The typical hydrophobic core of the immunoglobulin fold is mainly established by the inner β - strands b , c , e , and f , including the most buried positions b 3 , c 3 , and f 3 . the sequence , in several subtypes disulﬁde bridges are introduced which inﬂuence the overall domain shape and also the symmetry between the two sheets . Members of the immunoglobulin superfold are impressively widespread in nature . Immunoglobulin like domains have been identiﬁed in eukaryotes and prokaryotes , in vertebrates and invertebrates , and in fungi , parasites , bacteria , viruses , and plants . [ 82 ] Furthermore , members of the immunoglobulin like superfamilies exhibit a remarkable diversity in terms of biological activity . [ 82 ] Consequently , the question of the origin of the immunoglobulin fold rises , whether these proteins are homologous or analogous . If these proteins are homologous and originate from a common ancestor , the sequence has diverged during evolution to fulﬁll a substantial variety of distinct and independent functions . Otherwise , if these proteins are analogous , the immunoglobulin fold is a rather stable framework which many sequences have adopted during evolution . As most members of the immunoglobulin fold share such a low level of sequence identity , it is very diﬃcult to distinguish between convergent and divergent mechanisms of evolution . [ 96 ] So still nowadays the question remains , is the immunoglobulin fold derived from a common ancestor or is it a stable structure to which many sequences have converged ? 3 . 1 . 3 Immunoglobulin Amyloidogenicity The enormous diversity of immunoglobulin like domains in terms of biological activity and speciﬁcity comes at a price . During diversiﬁcation , structurally compromised im - munoglobulin like domains are frequently generated . Normally , dysfunctional molecules are eliminated by distinct quality control mechanisms of the cell . [ 97 , 98 ] However , occa - sionally the expression of structurally compromised molecules has pathological conse - quences . [ 99 , 100 ] For instance , the variable domain of the immunoglobulin light chain is 32 3 . 1 Introduction Figure 3 . 8 : Sequence alignment of C L and β 2 - microglobulin . The alignment is based on the regular secondary structures and generated with the software Jalview [ 95 ] according to Fig . 3 . 7 . Positions which are occupied by hydrophobic residues within the IgG domains are also conserved in β 2 m . However , the overall conservation is signiﬁcantly more pronounced between C L and β 2 m compared to C L and the other IgG domains . Yet , C L and β 2 m diﬀer fundamentally in respect of misfolding and aggregation . involved in diﬀerent human diseases , most of them associated with the aggregation of the polypeptide , like the light chain deposition disease ( LCDD ) [ 101 ] or the light chain amyloidosis . [ 102 ] Additionally , the MHC component β 2 - microglobulin , also a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily , is responsible for the dialysis related amyloidosis . [ 103 ] Amyloidosis is the origin of various disorders which are caused by the extracellular de - position of insoluble amyloid ﬁbrils in organs and / or tissues . These amyloids are long lived dissociation - and degradation - resistant structures , made up of β - strands that are arranged into sheets lying perpendicular to the long ﬁber axis and possess a core cross - β structure . [ 104 ] Despite the large variety of native folds adopted by amyloidogenic proteins , these structural features seem to be a recurring motif in amyloids suggesting a common assembly mechanism . [ 105 ] In addition , several studies indicate that folding intermediates are key precursors for the formation of amyloid ﬁbrils . [ 106 , 107 ] Bearing in mind that intermediates are a rather general aspect of protein folding reactions and that most polypeptides are in principle susceptible to amyloid forma - tion , [ 108 ] the question arises how proteins avoid aggregation in the majority of cases . To address this issue the folding pathway of the constant domain of the light chain ( C L ) was investigated with high structural resolution . Characterization of the folding intermediate of the C L domain might reveal insights into the essential prerequisites for a productive folding pathway . Moreover , the C L domain is a particularly instructive model system because it has never been directly associated with amyloidogenic diseases even if present at much higher concentrations in the blood than the amyloidogenic pro - tein β 2 - microglobulin . [ 109 ] Interestingly , β 2 m belongs to the same protein family and , like C L , forms a β - sandwich composed of seven strands stabilized by a single disulﬁde bond between strands b and f ( Fig . 3 . 8 ) . [ 110 , 111 ] The amyloidogenic properties of β 2 m are exceptionally well studied . As β 2 m readily forms amyloid ﬁbrils if partially unfolded ( e . g . at acidic pH ) , [ 112 ] the reaction is thought to be initiated by the population of a partially folded intermediate . [ 112 , 113 ] When such intermediates become long lived rather than transient species , they especially run the risk of misfolding and misassembly . Pro - ductive folding of β 2 m from a native like intermediate to the native state is limited by 33 Chapter 3 The C L Domain Explains Differences in Ig Amyloidogenicity Figure 3 . 9 : Cartoon representation of the C L domain compared with β 2 - microglobulin . The C L domain ( shown in blue ) and β 2 m ( illustrated in green ) are homologous members of the same protein family and adopt a highly conserved three dimensional structure , including the single disulﬁde bridge and the cis proline residue ( depicted in orange ) . an intrinsically slow trans - to - cis peptidyl - prolyl isomerization reaction . [ 113 , 114 ] Exper - iments in which the critical proline residue was held in the trans state conﬁrmed that this intermediate is the major determinant in amyloid formation . [ 113 , 115 ] In addition , further studies revealed that the most probable amyloidogenic precursor already pos - sesses large parts of the native β - sheet topology with only the outer strands and loop regions being distorted . [ 113 , 114 , 116 ] Remarkably , the cis proline residue associated with the amyloidogenic potential of β 2 m is conserved in the C L domain ( Fig . 3 . 9 ) . [ 110 ] Fur - thermore , the overall folding mechanisms of the two proteins are highly similar , [ 111 , 113 ] each populating an intermediate state en route to the native state . However , despite their sequence and structural similarities the folding landscapes of C L and β 2 m must exhibit considerable diﬀerences to either favor or prevent misfolding and aggregation . 3 . 2 Folding Pathway of the C L Domain In the current view , almost all proteins are believed to populate partially folded species , so called folding intermediates , along their pathways to the native state . [ 117 – 119 ] The characteristics of folding intermediates determine whether a protein is able to fold robustly or has the tendency to misfold . [ 120 ] Thus , a detailed structural characterization of folding intermediates is essential for the understanding of protein folding in general . Because they are transient , however , only very few folding intermediates have been described in atomic detail so far . [ 121 – 124 ] 34 3 . 2 Folding Pathway of the C L Domain 3 . 2 . 1 Backbone Assignment Backbone resonance assignment is a basic requirement for the structure determina - tion of proteins as well as for the analysis of protein dynamics and kinetics by NMR spectroscopy . Nowadays NMR studies on biomolecules typically use multidimensional techniques and isotopic labeling to resolve and identify the large number of peaks present in the spectrum . Already a simple two dimensional 1 H - 15 N HSQC experiment reveals insights into structural elements and dynamics of the biomolecule . Based on the dispersion of the proton dimension , it is possible to distinguish between an unfolded ( Fig . 4 . 6 ) and a well structured ( Fig . 3 . 10 ) protein . In the special case of all α - helical ( Fig . 5 . 4 ) and all β - sheet ( Fig . 3 . 10 ) proteins it is even feasible to identify these sec - ondary structure elements due to their characteristic proton dispersion . Furthermore , the line width in the proton dimension enables conclusions about the dynamical prop - erties of each single peak . To transfer this information onto an atomic level , each peak appearing in the HSQC spectrum has to be assigned according to its amino acid type and position within the protein sequence . Therefore , the triple - resonance experiments HNCO , HNcaCO , HNCA , CBCAcoNH , and HNCACB were recorded on a uniformly 15 N , 13 C labeled sample of the murine C L domain ( 103 AA ) . These spectra provide the C’ , C α , and C β chemical shifts of residue i and i − 1 . The chemical shifts are assembled into arrays termed pseudo - residues , each of them associated with a single resonance in the HSQC spectrum . According to the very sensitive relationship between the carbon chemical shifts and the amino acid type , the pseudo - residues can be linked to appropriate amino acids . Furthermore , each pseudo - residue holds the information on the carbon chemical shifts of its preceding residue . In the assignment process , the possibilities of suitable amino acids for each pseudo - residue and its adjacent residue are adjusted to the sequence of the protein . This assignment process was carried out semi - automatically using the program Pasta . [ 125 ] For the C L domain , this strategy resulted in the assignment of 73 residues out of 98 non - proline residues ( Fig . 3 . 10 ) . Besides very few isolated residues that could not be assigned , most of the unassigned residues concentrate to one region of the protein , the outer strand d and parts of its ﬂanking strand e including the connecting loop . This indicates that the residues in this region probably exhibit high water exchange rates of the amide protons or chemical exchange . 3 . 2 . 2 Secondary Structure On the way to the three dimensional structure determination , a central step is the identiﬁcation of secondary structure elements . Several indicators exist which present hints on the secondary structure elements α - helix , β - sheet or loop region . However , an unambiguous characterization of the secondary structure of a protein requires the com - bination of distinct methods . The most reliable of these methods is the identiﬁcation of helical or β - sheet secondary structure elements by their speciﬁc sequential 1 H - 1 H NOE pattern . [ 126 ] Whereas within an α - helix the short 1 H N i - 1 H N i + 1 distance gives rise 35 Chapter 3 The C L Domain Explains Differences in Ig Amyloidogenicity F i g u r e 3 . 10 : A ss i g n e d 1 H - 15 N H S Q C s p ec t r u m o f t h e C L d o m a i n ( 103 AA ) r ec o r d e d a t a t e m p e r a t u r e o f 25 ◦ C a nd a p r o t o n f r e q u e n c y o f 750 M H z . 36 3 . 2 Folding Pathway of the C L Domain Figure 3 . 11 : Consensus chemical shift index of the C L domain . These consensus predictions are based on a simple majority rule , applied whenever at least two out of three diﬀerent chemical shift indices argue for one particular secondary structure element . Analysis of the carbon chemical shifts C’ , C α , and C β of the C L domain indicates the expected 7 β - strands as well as the two short helical elements . to an intense cross peak , the characteristic pattern within the β - sheet shows an in - tense 1 H α i - 1 H Ni + 1 cross peak . Another indicator for the diﬀerent structural elements are three bond J couplings which are correlated with the intervening torsion angles Φ and Ψ by the Karplus equation . [ 127 ] In natively folded proteins the backbone Φ and Ψ conformations depend on steric eﬀects , both within individual amino acids and between side chains of diﬀerent residues , and on secondary structure interactions such as hydrogen bond formation . The well established Karplus relationship between the backbone torsion angle Φ and the 3 J H N H α coupling constant enables conclusions about the secondary structure elements as the coupling constant ranges from 3 . 9 Hz for α helices to 8 . 9 Hz for anti - parallel β - sheets and 9 . 7 Hz for parallel β - sheets . [ 128 , 129 ] And ﬁnally the probably simplest method for identifying protein secondary structure is the analysis of backbone 13 C chemical shifts . Due to the strong correlation between carbon chemical shift and secondary structure , a chemical shift index ( CSI ) can be assigned to each residue based on the deviation of its chemical shifts from the random coil val - ues . [ 130 , 131 ] Secondary structure elements are deﬁned according to the values and local densities of these chemical shift indices . As the study of the C L domain mainly focuses on the folding pathway and in addition various crystal structures of the C L domain in the context of the Fab region or even the whole antibody molecule have already been elucidated , there is no need for a complete structure determination of the C L domain in solution . However , since the backbone resonance assignment is the basic prerequisite for the characterization of the folding pathway , the carbon chemical shifts obtained for the assignment process can be further analyzed in respect of secondary structure elements . This analysis allows conclusions 37 Chapter 3 The C L Domain Explains Differences in Ig Amyloidogenicity about the secondary structure of the protein in solution without any additional exper - iments . Comparing the measured carbon chemical shifts with the random coil values results in chemical shift indices for each backbone carbon nucleus . The CSI takes the value 0 for chemical shifts within the range of the random coil values , 1 for chemical shifts greater than the range and − 1 for shifts less than the range . For the carbon nu - clei C’ and C α a group of four or more CSI values of 1 not interrupted by a CSI value of − 1 indicates an α - helix , whereas a group of three or more continuous CSI values of − 1 suggests a β - strand . All other regions are designated as coil . In contrast , the C β chemical shift index only enables the identiﬁcation of β - sheet structures . In this case , four or more consecutive CSI values of 1 support the assumption of a β - strand being present . For the C L domain , this approximate evaluation suggests an identical sec - ondary structure in solution as compared to the crystal . Remarkably , even though this method only provides hints the residues constituting the secondary structure elements are completely consistent . Furthermore , this approach clearly indicates the existence of the two short strand connecting helical elements also in solution ( Fig . 3 . 11 ) . 3 . 2 . 3 Folding Kinetics The C L domain folds via an intermediate on two parallel pathways to its native state . [ 111 ] The slower pathway is limited by the isomerization of the Tyr - 34 – Pro - 35 bond to the native cis conformation which predominantly adopts the trans conformation in the un - folded state . In general , proline residues are exclusively synthesized in the trans form by the ribosome . Since the cis and trans conformation of peptide bonds preceding a proline residue are almost isoenergetic , with the trans form being slightly more favor - able , unfolded polypeptides exhibit a mixture of cis and trans states . [ 132 ] Due to the thermodynamic equilibrium , 10 - 30 % of these peptide bonds N - terminal to a proline residue occur in the cis conformation . [ 133 ] However , native proteins exist essentially completely in either the trans or the cis form . As a consequence , molecules with a native cis conformation have to undergo the intrinsically slow isomerization reaction . Within the cell enzymes such as peptidyl - prolyl isomerases catalyze the trans - cis iso - merization . In vitro this isomerization decisively determines the rate of protein folding allowing the characterization of the folding pathway by real time NMR spectroscopy . In the case of the C L domain only ∼ 10 % of the molecules adopt the native cis conforma - tion in the unfolded state at equilibrium and are able to fold to the native state within a few seconds . Whereas ∼ 90 % of the molecules exist in the non - native trans confor - mation and need to undergo the isomerization reaction before complete folding to the native state . [ 111 , 134 ] At 2 ◦ C this reaction takes several hours and therefore populates the major kinetic intermediate for a considerable amount of time . In order to characterize the intermediate state and also the folding pathway of the C L domain , real time 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectra were measured during refolding from the chemically denatured state . For this purpose , 15 N - labeled unfolded C L in PBS buﬀer containing 2 M GdmCl was diluted 10 - fold by adding ice cold PBS buﬀer with - out GdmCl and HSQC spectra were recorded immediately after mixing at 2 ◦ C every 38 3 . 2 Folding Pathway of the C L Domain F i g u r e 3 . 12 : Sup e r i m p o s e d 1 H - 15 N H S Q C s p ec t r a o f t h e n a t i v e s t a t e ( s h o w n i n r e d ) a nd t h e i n t e r m e d i a t e s t a t e ( d e p i c t e d i n g r ee n ) o f t h e C L d o m a i n .

The ﬁrst spectrum reﬂects almost exclusively the kinetic intermediate and had only to be corrected for 10 % of the C L molecules possessing the correct Tyr - 34 – Pro - 35 isomerization state . This correction was achieved by subtracting 10 % of the ﬁnal spectrum after 7 h from the ﬁrst HSQC spectrum with the software Topspin 1 . 3 ( Bruker BioSpin ) . Because the chemical shifts of the amide protons strongly depend on their molecular environment , overlaying the HSQC spectra of the intermediate and the native state reveals similarities and changes in their environment during the folding process ( Fig . 3 . 12 ) . For the intermediate state of the C L domain some residues already seem to sense their native environment whereas other residues indicate substantial dif - ferences between the native and the intermediate state . To gain more insights into the structural properties of the intermediate , the change in peak intensity at the native chemical shift position was followed over time for each assigned residue . Consistent with the ﬁrst spectrum representing solely the intermediate state and likewise studying only the slow folding pathway to the native state , all spectra during refolding were corrected for the fast folding pathway analogous to the ﬁrst spectrum . Except for the residues with already native like intensity after the dead time of the experiment , in every case the change in intensity during the folding process could be well described by a single exponential function ( Fig . 3 . 13 ) . The time constants of the folding of the indi - vidual residues show stochastic behavior around a mean value of τ = 199 min at 2 ◦ C without any signiﬁcant systematic deviations for any part of the protein . In contrast , extrapolating the exponential functions to obtain the initial amplitudes at time zero presents considerable discrepancies for distinct parts of the protein . Even though every residue folds cooperatively with the same rate constant to the native state , the initial amplitudes indicate a varying degree of local structuring within the intermediate state . As the amide resonances represent very sensitive indicators for changes in their local environment , it has to be kept in mind that low initial amplitudes are not mandatory equal to missing secondary structure , but might just as well indicate the requirement for local rearrangements such as side chain packing or hydrogen bond formation . In Fig . 3 . 13 regions of high or low local structuring are mapped on the crystal structure of the C L domain revealing an interesting pattern : almost native initial amplitudes are found in vicinity of the two short helices connecting strand a and b as well as e and f and adjacent β - sheet termini suggesting that these parts already adopt a native like conformation in the intermediate state , whereas low initial amplitudes are observed for some of the β - strands , in particular strands c and d which argues for a lack of native interactions . Interestingly , the two helices and their local environment seem to be already completely structured in the major folding intermediate of the C L domain . Certainly , the initial HSQC amplitudes only provide hints on the structural proper - ties of the intermediate . Equilibrium spectroscopic data would give information more directly related to structure . Mutating the Pro - 35 residue against another amino acid that preferentially adopts a trans peptide bond , [ 135 ] might trap the kinetic intermediate . Populating the folding intermediate at equilibrium would enable a detailed investigation of its structural features . 40 3 . 2 Folding Pathway of the C L Domain Figure 3 . 13 : Folding kinetics of the C L domain .

In addition , denatu - rant induced unfolding transitions show that the Pro35Ala mutation leads to a stability reduction of the C L domain by > 50 % which is consistent with a partially folded species representing the major equilibrium state . Furthermore , so called chevron plots en - able the determination of folding and unfolding rate constants . For this purpose , the protein sample is rapidly diluted to a particular denaturant concentration and the es - tablishment of the new equilibrium is directly monitored by ﬂuorescence spectroscopy . Plotting the logarithm of the calculated relaxation rates as a function of the denat - urant concentration results in the chevron plot . The analysis of these chevron plots indicates that the wild type ( C wtL ) folds to its intermediate state with a very similar rate constant as C P 35 A L folds to its ﬁnal state . These data argue for the C P 35 A L mutant populating the kinetic intermediate at equilibrium which is trapped by the trans state of the bond preceding Ala - 35 . Based on these experiments , the structure of C P 35 A L was further characterized by NMR spectroscopy . 3 . 3 . 1 Backbone and Aliphatic Side Chain Assignment The 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectra of the C wtL kinetic intermediate and the C P 35 A L mutant are almost completely superimposable ( Fig . 3 . 14 ) , demonstrating equivalent secondary and tertiary structure in both species . Crucially , trapping of the intermediate state allows an assignment to be carried out which is not feasible for the transiently populated kinetic intermediate observed in the folding pathway of C wtL . Backbone resonance as - signment for the C P 35 A L mutant was achieved by recording the same standard backbone experiments and following the same assignment procedure as for the wild type C wtL . To highlight similarities and dissimilarities regarding the structural properties of the native and the intermediate state , further experiments for both , the wild type and the mutant , are required . In general , folding intermediates often adopt a near native topology with incompletely folded or partially misfolded structural elements such as side chain interactions . [ 121 – 124 , 136 , 137 ] To verify the side chain packing and interactions in the wild type C wtL and the C P 35 A L mutant , in addition to the backbone resonances the side chain resonances also have to be assigned . Therefore , the triple resonance experiments ( H ) CCH - TOCSY which correlates the carbon nuclei of a complete spin system and ( H ) CCH - COSY which gives information about adjacent carbon nuclei were measured . The combination of these spectra that take advantage of the higher chemical 1 Since this project was conducted in collaboration with the group of Prof . Dr .

Aromatic resonances generally escape this assignment process . As the connection of the aromatic protons with the aliphatic side chains necessitates several additional experiments , the assignment of the aromatic resonances was not taken into account . Still , based on the assignment of the backbone resonances and the aliphatic side chains of both species , C wtL and C P 35 A L , a set of NOESY spectra can identify diﬀerences in the structure of the native and the intermediate state . 3 . 3 . 2 Comparison of Secondary and Tertiary Structure of the Wild Type and the Mutant It is well known that the chemical shifts of backbone atoms in proteins are extremely sensitive to local conformations . Based on this strong correlation between chemical shifts and protein secondary structure , Wishart deﬁned the chemical shift index ( CSI ) which enables the characterization of secondary structure elements subsequently to the protein backbone assignment . [ 130 , 131 ] This primarily idea of the chemical shift index was further expanded by the software Talos . [ 138 ] Besides the chemical shift itself , Talos takes advantage of homologous proteins which display quite similar patterns of secondary chemical shifts . Meanwhile the database of the program contains C α , C β , C’ , H α , and N H chemical shifts of the structured parts of 186 proteins for which a high resolution ( ≤ 2 . 2 ˚A ) X - ray crystal structure is available . Talos searches this database for strings of three adjacent residues with the closest similarity in secondary chemical shift and amino acid sequence to those of the query triplet . Averaging the backbone angles of the ten most consistent triplets from the database , provides a reliable predic - tion for the Φ and Ψ dihedral angles of the central residue within the query sequence . The ten Φ / Ψ pairs with the highest similarities are graphed in the Ramachandran plot which also highlights the most populated areas of the entire database ( Fig . 3 . 15 ) . De - spite the relatively small database Talos searches through , the approach to combine both chemical shift and residue type information and also to consider a string of three residues instead of a single one , enables a reliable prediction of the Φ and Ψ torsion angles and consequently for the backbone secondary structure . A successful search for chemical shift similarities requires an identical referencing of all chemical shifts . Before crystal structures and corresponding chemical shifts are included into the Talos database , an algorithm is applied to the deposited chemical shifts which corrects all secondary shifts according to the appropriate reference standard for each nucleus and hence ensures that all of the shifts are deﬁned in the same manner . To allow a reasonable similarity search , the same procedure applies for all experimental chemical shifts . Typically , 1 H and 13 C chemical shifts are referenced to the internal standard trimethylsilyl propionate ( TSP ) . In the case of C wtL and C P 35 A L referencing of the H N dimension was achieved by the external standard TSP and subsequently all other dimensions were referenced indirectly . To be consistent with the direct referencing to the carbon chemical shift of the TSP methyl groups , 2 . 6 ppm had to be added to all 44 3 . 3 Structural Characterization of the Trapped Folding Intermediate Figure 3 . 15 : Prediction of the Φ and Ψ dihedral angles by the software Talos . The ten Φ / Ψ pairs from the database with the highest similarity in secondary chemical shift and amino acid sequence to the query triplet are indicated as small green squares in the Ramachandran plot . Highlighted in gray are the areas which correspond to the torsion angles characteristic for the secondary structure elements β - sheet , right handed α - helix , and left handed α - helix . Left : Talos output for the residue Val - 27 of the C L domain . Due to the consistent matches with triplets from the database , the predicted Φ and Ψ angles argue for a β - sheet structure at position 27 . Right : Talos output for residue Glu - 79 of the C L domain . In this case , the predicted torsion angles clearly suggest that residue 79 is part of an α - helical structure . It should be noted that approximately 2 % of the predictions made by Talos are found to be in error . carbon dimensions . Prediction of the Φ and Ψ dihedral angles by the software Talos reverts to the chemical shifts of C α , C β , C’ , H α , and N H . However , the standard backbone resonance assignment is restricted to the carbon chemical shifts C’ , C α , and C β and the nitrogen chemical shift N H . Although the H α chemical shift requires additional experiments , it should be included in the characterization of the protein secondary structure as this proton chemical shift is one of the most sensitive indicators for the diﬀerent backbone conformations . [ 131 ] Therefore , the side chain assignment of the wild type C wtL and the mutant C P 35 A L is not only prerequisite for the interpretation of the NOESY spectra , but also allows the determination of the backbone Φ and Ψ angles . For nearly all of the assigned residues , Talos was able to ﬁnd highly consistent matches within its database , arguing for a reliable prediction of the dihedral angles . Fig . 3 . 15 illustrates the graphical output of the ten Φ / Ψ pairs with the highest similarities and the corresponding averaged Φ and Ψ values for two representative residues of the C L domain . The backbone torsion angles of C wtL and C P 35 A L indicate an almost identical secondary structure in the intermediate and the native state . This particularly holds for the central β - strands b , c , f , and partly strand e that constitute the hydrophobic core of the protein and also for the outer strand g . Notably , the predicted Φ and Ψ dihedral angles for the C P 35 A L mutant clearly identify the two short helices , suggesting that these secondary structure elements are already completely evolved in the intermediate state . Since it is generally assumed that folding intermediates adopt a native like topology , [ 136 , 137 ] C wtL and C P 35 A L are examined more precisely in respect of their tertiary structure . 45 Chapter 3 The C L Domain Explains Differences in Ig Amyloidogenicity Figure 3 . 16 : Comparison of backcalculated ( shown in blue ) and experimental ( shown in red ) NOESY - strip for Lys - 41 as representative residue of the C L domain . The simulated NOESY strip for Lys - 41 indicates the assignment for expected cross peaks within a radius of 5 ˚A . Additionally the software requires a threshold for the peak intensity to account for the experimental noise . To simplify matters , adjacent NOESY - strips from residues other than Lys - 41 within the pictured experimental strip have been omitted . Thus , a set of 3D - NOESY spectra was recorded , including NNH - and CNH - NOESY spectra [ 139 ] in addition to the conventional 15 N - HSQC - NOESY spectrum . Analysis of these NOESY spectra was performed in combination with a backcalculation software ( Fig . 3 . 16 ) . This in - house software simulates the NOESY strip of a certain residue according to the adjusted parameters , like for instance the NOESY mixing time , the correlation time of the protein , and the reachable radius around the query residue . For C wtL the backcalculation of the NOESY spectra was based on the crystal structure of the C L domain ( pdb 1ors ) . The notable agreement between the backcalculated NOESY strips from the crystal structure and the experimental NMR data for all of the recorded spectra evidence an identical three dimensional structure for the C L domain in the crystal and in solution . Furthermore , the simulated NOESY strip indicates the assignment and also the expected intensity for each cross peak . This facilitated the interpretation of the NOESY spectra of C wtL and the identiﬁcation of structural varieties between the native state and the intermediate . The comparison of the experimental NOESY strips of corresponding residues of the wild type C wtL and the mutant C P 35 A L revealed that large parts of the proteins give rise to cross peaks within the same range . Regions in C P 35 A L with signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the carbon chemical shifts and the NOESY pattern from C wtL are exclusively located around Ala - 35 and strands d and e . Remarkably , the two helices connecting strands a and b as well as e and f are fully formed in the C P 35 A L mutant , as judged from the characteristic NOE pattern for helical structural elements . [ 126 ] 46 3 . 3 Structural Characterization of the Trapped Folding Intermediate 3 . 3 . 3 NMR - restrained MD Simulations To gain further dynamic and structural information that cannot be deduced from the NMR experiments alone , molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations with NMR - derived restraints were performed . 2 The C P 35 A L mutant was created from the crystal structure of the C L domain ( pdb 1fh5 ) by replacing Pro - 35 against Ala and setting the bond preceding Ala - 35 to trans . This mutant was energy - minimized with the steepest - descent and the adopted Newton - Rhapson methods . [ 140 ] The restraints for the MD simulations were derived from a comparison of the experimental NMR data of C wtL and C P 35 A L . Residues with similar chemical shifts and NOESY cross peaks within the same range in both proteins were restrained by minimizing the RMSD of the interatomic distances with respect to the crystal structure . Residues that diﬀer in chemical shifts and the NOESY pattern or are unassigned in the C P 35 A L mutant alone were restrained toward zero native contacts . Furthermore , Φ and Ψ dihedral angles were restrained according to the values determined by Talos . To minimize the number of restraints , only residues located in secondary structure elements were taken into account . These restraints were applied in conjunction with a simulated annealing like protocol to enhance the sampling of the conformational space . This approach resulted in an ensemble of structures which best represent the partially folded state ( Fig . 3 . 17 ) . The simulations verify that the overall topology of C P 35 A L is on average well retained . Additionally , both helices are fully structured in the simulations and display only mi - nor ﬂuctuations . Strikingly , the edge strands a and g adopt native conformations in all simulated structures . However , the ensemble of structures reveals considerable het - erogeneity at the ends of some strands which is especially pronounced around Ala - 35 , arguing for a partial distortion of one edge of the protein by the trans state of the peptide bond preceding residue 35 . The only strand that experiences signiﬁcant ﬂuc - tuations is strand d . Just residues Val - 53 and Leu - 54 of this strand form native like interactions in the ensemble of structures which is in good agreement with NOE signals observed exclusively for these residues within strand d . Furthermore , the N termini of strand e and strand g show some ﬂexibility as indicated by a mixture of structures with full or partial ordering of the respective strands in the MD simulations . Interest - ingly , the partial disordering of strand e and one of its ends provides a rationale for the missing NMR assignment of some residues from its ﬂanking strand b which itself is highly structured in the simulations . Taken together , the combination of NMR experiments and MD simulations presents a powerful approach to obtain a detailed picture of the major C L folding intermediate . The two small helices and their local environment are completely folded and the in - termediate exhibits a native like core structure despite the presence of ﬂexible regions that are able to adopt a variety of conformations . 2 The MD simulations themselves were run by Zu Thur Yew , a PhD student in the group of Dr . Emanuele Paci , Astbury Center for Structural Molecular Biology , University of Leeds , UK . 47 Chapter 3 The C L Domain Explains Differences in Ig Amyloidogenicity Figure 3 . 17 : Structural characterization of the folding intermediate of the C L domain by NMR - restrained MD simulations .

The unstructured loop regions of human β 2 m are depicted in blue , the corresponding helical elements in C L are colored in red . The exchange mutant β 2 m toCL was synthesized and the altered sequences between strands a and b as well as strands e and f are shown . 3 . 4 Amyloidogenic Properties of the C L Domain and β 2 - microglobulin No indication exists that the constant domain of the antibody light chain is in any manner directly responsible for amyloidogenic processes even though it adopts the same topology as the amyloidogenic variable domain ( V L ) or β 2 - microglobulin . In both cases , amyloid formation is assumed to proceed from a partially folded intermediate state . [ 116 , 141 ] Interestingly , non of these proteins possesses the short strand connecting helices of the C L domain . As these helical elements are already fully evolved in the C L folding intermediate , their sequence or structure might play a role in the inhibition of amyloid formation . Consequently , the exchange of the unstructured loop regions connecting strands a and b as well as strands e and f in β 2 m against the corresponding helical elements of the C L domain ( β 2 m toCL ) could provide insights into the diﬀerences in amyloidogenicity ( Fig . 3 . 18 ) . The β 2 m toCL exchange mutant folds to a well deﬁned structure with similar far - UV CD - spectroscopic properties like wild type β 2 m . The transplanted helical elements destabilize β 2 m toCL against thermal denaturation , but have only a minor eﬀect on its pH stability as compared to β 2 m . According to the Tango algorithm [ 142 ] that identiﬁes β - aggregating regions of a protein sequence , the aggregation propensity of the primary sequence is left unaﬀected by the mutations . To study the amyloidogenic properties of the distinct proteins , ﬁbrillization experiments were performed analogous to established reaction conditions for β 2 m . [ 143 ] Each protein solution of C wtL , C P 35 A L , β 2 m , and β 2 m toCL respectively was incubated at pH 1 . 5 and pH 3 . 0 for 7 days under slight shaking at 37 ◦ C . Additionally , all proteins were incubated under physiological conditions at pH 7 . 4 and 37 ◦ C either seeded with β 2 m ﬁbrils or not . Formation of amyloid ﬁbrils was monitored by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . As expected , C wtL and the C P 35 A L mutant are not at all prone to ﬁbril formation . Im - portantly , an obvious diﬀerence in amyloidogenicity is observed for wild type β 2 m and the β 2 m toCL mutant ( Fig . 3 . 19 ) . Whereas β 2 m readily forms ﬁbrils under all conditions 49 Chapter 3 The C L Domain Explains Differences in Ig Amyloidogenicity Figure 3 . 19 : Amyloidogenic properties of β 2 m and the β 2 m toCL exchange mutant . The exchange mutant β 2 m toCL clearly diﬀers from wild type β 2 m in respect of its amyloidogenicity . tested , in the case of β 2 m toCL just pH 1 . 5 induced the formation of ﬁbrils , however these ﬁbrils are considerably shorter and less pronounced as compared to wild type β 2 m . Al - ready at pH 3 . 0 , amyloid ﬁbrils were detectable only in very few experiments , and under physiological conditions ﬁbril formation was unveriﬁable , even in cross - seeding exper - iments with sonicated β 2 m ﬁbrils . These data clearly demonstrate that transplanting the sequences corresponding to the C L helices into the β 2 m framework signiﬁcantly reduces its amyloidogenicity . 3 . 5 Discussion The structural characteristics of a folding intermediate decisively determine the folding landscape of a protein to either favor productive folding like for the C L domain or to run the risk of harmful misfolding and aggregation like for β 2 m . Therefore , a detailed picture of the folding intermediate of the C L domain can provide insights into the de - terminants that distinguish the productive folding pathway of C L from the aggregation prone folding pathway of the structurally similar β 2 m . A combination of NMR exper - iments together with MD simulations reveals an ensemble of structures that represent the major kinetic folding intermediate of the C L domain . These structures indicate that only minor variations in the sequences of highly homologous proteins can remarkably inﬂuence the folding landscapes and thus result in vital or pathogenic biomolecules . The major kinetic folding intermediate of the C L domain already adopts the typical immunoglobulin β - sheet topology for large parts of the protein . The only strand that seems to pass through a variety of distinct conformations and thus appears highly distorted in the ensemble of structures is the edge strand d . All other strands and in particular strands b , c , e , and f which constitute the folding nucleus of Ig proteins [ 144 , 145 ] exhibit some dynamics but are already well structured . The most remarkable structural 50 3 . 5 Discussion feature of the intermediate are the two completely folded small helices . Although these helical elements are strongly conserved in constant antibody domains , their role in the folding process and their inﬂuence on the structure of the intermediate has not been recognized yet . These helices seem to fulﬁll a spacer and orienting function between strands a - b and e - f and provide hydrogen bond donors and acceptors for adjacent strands and loops . In addition , the helices appear to position hydrophobic residues ( e . g . Tyr - 80 in helix 2 ) that enables their participation in the formation of the hydrophobic core . Hence , these two helices can be regarded as a scaﬀold within the C L intermediate favoring the establishment of a native like topology by correctly positioning important parts of the molecule . A widespread assumption for the underlying mechanism of protein aggregation as - signs the keystone to intermolecular β - sheet formation . β - strands buried within the hydrophobic core of the protein are naturally prone to aggregation as these strands al - ways attempt to satisfy their hydrogen bonding potential . Certainly , the edge strands of β - sheet proteins must diﬀer from the central β - strands in order to promote solubility over aggregation for natively folded proteins . Characteristically , these edge strands are irregular or short β - strands or otherwise unsuitable for further β interactions . Thus , the edge strands of β - sheet proteins are the decisive factor for prevention of amyloid like aggregation . [ 146 , 147 ] Interestingly , the edge strands a and g on one side of the β - sheet of the C L intermediate are native like in all simulated structures . In contrast , in the amyloidogenic intermediate of β 2 m these strands a and g and also strand d experience signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations resulting in disordered β - strands on both sides of the protein . [ 113 – 116 , 148 ] Distorsion of the edge strands of a β - sheet protein leaves the core β - strands unprotected leading to intermolecular β - sheet formation to satisfy the hydrogen bond potential which turns a soluble monomer into an aggregating oligomer . Therefore , the marked diﬀerence in amyloidogenicity between C L and β 2 m might be based on the distinct structuring of their edge strands . Whereas in the amyloidogenic intermediate of β 2 m the central β - strands are unprotected on both sides of the protein molecule enabling a linear arrangement of monomers into ﬁbrils , within the C L inter - mediate just the edge strand d on one side of the protein is partially distorted , however on the other side of the β - sheet the edge strands a and g fulﬁll their protective function and thus might prevent oligomerization . Since the helical elements in the C L intermediate inhere a crucial role in productive folding , their function as scaﬀold elements might be responsible for the higher degree of local structuring particularly pronounced for the edge strand a as compared to the intermediate of β 2 m . Indeed , grafting the sequences that correspond to the C L he - lices onto the corresponding positions in β 2 m signiﬁcantly reduces the propensity of β 2 m to form amyloids . As these helices represent robust folding elements , their struc - tural characteristics seem to cause the marked diﬀerence in amyloidogenicity . However , sequence eﬀects by the transplanted elements themselves cannot be completely ruled out . Besides , β 2 m readily forms ﬁbrils even though it is considerably more stable than C L . [ 111 , 113 ] Accordingly , the most important factor that determines the amyloidogenic propensity of a protein is not the stability of the native state per se , but rather the 51 Chapter 3 The C L Domain Explains Differences in Ig Amyloidogenicity sequence of the protein [ 149 ] and structural characteristics of partially folded species that may be populated along the folding pathway . [ 143 ] In conclusion , these data clearly demonstrate how a high degree of local structuring in a protein folding intermediate can substantially inﬂuence the folding landscape and favor robust folding over harmful misfolding . The distinct properties of C L and β 2 m can be understood in evolutionary terms . Selection of antibodies took place under harsh extracellular conditions with high concentrations of the multimeric protein present , [ 150 ] whereas β 2 m is found at much lower concentrations and usually associated with the MHC complex . [ 151 ] Thus , small diﬀerences , acquired over the course of evolution , be - tween members of the same protein superfamily can lead to the avoidance of pathogenic misfolding reactions while preserving an identical protein topology . 52 Chapter 4 The Antibody Domain C H 1 Controls the Secretion of IgG Molecules Extracellular proteins are essential for many processes underlying multicellular life . Prerequisite for their biological functions is proper folding into the native tertiary structure and also assembly into a deﬁned quaternary structure . [ 152 ] A particularly important example in this respect are IgG antibodies in which two heavy and two light chains have to associate prior to secretion from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . [ 153 , 154 ] While isolated antibody light chains can be secreted from the ER , unassembled Ig heavy chains are actively and eﬃciently retained in the ER by interaction with the molec - ular chaperone BiP . [ 155 , 156 ] Since the heavy chains comprise most antibody eﬀector functions , a tight quality control of their assembly prior to secretion is vital . [ 152 ] It is known that the ﬁrst constant domain of the heavy chain , the C H 1 domain , plays a crucial role in this retention process . [ 153 , 155 ] If deleted or replaced with another anti - body domain , isolated heavy chains can be secreted as it occurs in the case of the rare heavy chain diseases [ 157 , 158 ] or naturally in camelid antibodies . [ 159 ] In the context of the whole IgG molecule , the C H 1 domain adopts the typical immunoglobulin fold and is associated with the constant domain of the light chain , the C L domain . As the basic principles underlying the unusual behavior of the C H 1 domain have remained enigmatic , the role of the C H 1 / C L association for correct antibody assembly was studied in more detail . In general , the individual domains of an immunoglobulin molecule exhibit highly similar three dimensional structures and fold to their native state autonomously . [ 134 , 160 , 161 ] In contrast , the isolated C H 1 domain of the heavy chain is a natively unfolded protein . However , the C L domain , the cognate association part - ner of C H 1 in the antibody , is necessary and suﬃcient to induce structure formation in C H 1 . Structural characterization of the C H 1 domain and its association coupled fold - ing reaction by NMR spectroscopy revealed an atomic level description of the folding 53 Chapter 4 The C H 1 Domain Controls the Secretion of IgG Molecules pathway that proceeds via a partially structured encounter complex . Speciﬁc recogni - tion of a few key interface residues between C L and C H 1 results in the formation of a folding nucleus in the C H 1 domain . Subsequently , the isomerization of peptidyl - prolyl bonds within C H 1 which possesses an unusually high number of three cis prolines in the native state [ 110 ] paves the path to the completely structured C H 1 domain . The interaction of C H 1 with the molecular chaperone BiP could be reconstituted in vitro which identiﬁed the folding status of the C H 1 domain as the key determinant for chaperone binding and allowed to establish an overall mechanism for antibody secretion control in vitro . Furthermore , in vivo experiments in which the folding characteristics of the C H 1 domain were transplanted into the IgG light chain proof that its natively unfolded nature plays indeed the decisive role in antibody secretion control in the cell . These data provide insights into the folding pathway and the assembly of natively disordered proteins and highlight the structural plasticity within a highly conserved protein topology to fulﬁll speciﬁc biological requirements . 4 . 1 Introduction 4 . 1 . 1 Secretion of Antibody Molecules Proteins destined for secretion , for the plasma membrane , and for the secretory and en - docytic organelles are synthesized by ribosomes associated with the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . [ 152 ] These ribosomes release the nascent protein chains into the ER which provides an environment optimized for protein folding and matu - ration . Like the lumen of other organelles of the secretory pathway , the ER lumen is extracytosolic and therefore topologically equivalent to the extracellular space . To ensure that only native conformers reach their target organelles and compartments , the ER possesses a variety of quality control mechanisms for ’proof - reading’ newly syn - thesized proteins . [ 162 – 164 ] The primary quality control mechanism is based on general biophysical and structural properties such as the exposure of hydrophobic regions or the tendency to aggregate that distinguish native from non - native protein conforma - tions . During the folding and assembly process into the native conformer , these features are naturally transient resulting in a temporary interaction of newly synthesized pro - teins with the quality control factors . These molecular chaperones and folding enzymes that reside in the ER lumen in high concentrations [ 165 – 167 ] stabilize incompletely folded polypeptide chains , protect them from aggregation , and also in many cases promote folding . Once folded , the cargo molecules are no longer retained in the ER and conse - quently enter the exit sites . This export of individual proteins is regulated by various selective mechanisms which constitute the secondary quality control mechanism . [ 163 , 168 ] Each molecule involved in the secondary quality control has its own speciﬁc recogni - tion mechanism for certain protein species or protein families . These molecules assist in assembling of oligomeric proteins , accompany native conformers out of the ER , and provide signals for intracellular transport . After passing through this quality control 54 4 . 1 Introduction Figure 4 . 1 : Organelles involved in the secretory pathway . The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) is the site of synthesis and maturation of proteins entering the secretory pathway . Once folded and assembled into the native conformer , the cargo molecules enter the ER exit sites . Vesicles that are coated with the coatomer protein ( COP ) II bud oﬀ and traﬃc through the ER - Golgi intermediate compartment ( ERGIC ) to the cis - face of the Golgi complex . In certain cases , the retrieval of misfolded proteins from the Golgi complex by COPI vesicles occurs . On their way through the Golgi complex the proteins become further modiﬁed , like phosphorylated or glycosylated and ﬁnally sorted according to their function and destination . After the proteins passed through the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) , they proceed to the plasma membrane or beyond . natively folded and assembled proteins leave the ER for the Golgi complex ( Fig . 4 . 1 ) . In contrast , partially folded and incompletely assembled proteins are not transported to their ﬁnal destination in the cell , but retained in the ER . Persistently misfolded pro - teins and unassembled oligomers are retro - translocated from the ER into the cytosol and subsequently degraded by proteasomes , a process named ER - associated degrada - tion ( ERAD ) . [ 169 – 172 ] Recent studies indicated that 30 - 75 % of newly synthesized proteins and in some cases even growing nascent chains are degraded within 20 min . [ 173 – 175 ] The reason for this apparently wasteful behavior of the cell is still unknown . Most of the peptides bound to the MHC class I molecules on the surface of T cells originate from the ongoing degradation of newly synthesized and nascent proteins . [ 176 ] Therefore this apparent wastefulness might actually be an essential function , as in the case of an infection of the cell by a virus and production of viral protein , this infection can rapidly be detected by the T cells . [ 175 ] Nevertheless , this immense production of degradation prone proteins also results in various diseases . If polypeptides in non - native conformations are not recognized eﬃciently or the degradation system fails , these proteins aggregate and accumulate in the cell and tissues leading to the formation of degradation resistant amyloids . [ 177 ] 55 Chapter 4 The C H 1 Domain Controls the Secretion of IgG Molecules Figure 4 . 2 : Immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein ( BiP ) is one of the most abundant pro - teins in the ER lumen . Left : Cartoon representation of the crystal structure of bovine Hsc70 ( pdb 1yuw ) , [ 178 ] a well studied representative of the Hsp70 class . Like all members of this chaperone family , the molecule possesses two separable functional units : the N - terminal ( light blue ) ATPase activity and the C - terminal ( dark blue ) substrate binding that is almost completely determined by the interaction with a ﬁve residue core ( depicted in red ) . Right : Surface representation of the substrate binding do - main of DnaK , another representative of the Hsp70 family , bound to a heptapeptide ( pdb 1dkz ) . [ 179 ] This peptide interacts with DnaK in an extended conformation through a channel deﬁned by loops from the β sandwich . An increased ﬂexibility in the outer loops of the binding domain in the ATP state frees up the binding site for substrate release and rebinding . In addition to the reliable recognition of non - native protein conformations , the ER has to fulﬁll a second equally important function , the assistance in productive folding and assembly . Although some proteins fold quite eﬃciently , many of them fold inef - ﬁciently . [ 180 , 181 ] Moreover , especially hetero - oligomeric proteins show a poor success rate of maturation and single subunits as well as incompletely assembled oligomers have to be retained in the ER and eventually retro - translocated for degradation . [ 182 ] The ER speciﬁc Hsp70 chaperone family member BiP plays an essential role in direct - ing protein folding and assembly as well as targeting misfolded proteins for retrograde translocation . This molecular chaperone identiﬁes non - native protein conformations by recognizing a short heptapeptide of aliphatic residues in alternating positions . [ 183 – 185 ] Even though this is a common motif present in most proteins , the interaction of BiP with this binding site is speciﬁc and limited to a few secretory pathway proteins . [ 167 ] Besides the fact that naturally these recognition motifs are exposed only transiently and buried rapidly while the protein folds to its native state , the binding to the hydrophobic peptide sequence depends not only on the exposure but also on the dynamic properties and the sterically accessibility . [ 186 ] Several studies indicate that BiP undergoes cycles of binding and release from unfolded or partially folded proteins with folding occurring during the release cycle . [ 187 ] Like all members of the Hsp70 family , BiP also binds both ADP and ATP . Due to diﬀerences in conformation and mobility between the ATP state and the ADP state , substrate binding activity can be modulated by the ATPase unit ( Fig . 4 . 2 ) . [ 188 ] 56 4 . 1 Introduction This molecular chaperone BiP also controls the folding of individual immunoglobulin domains and the assembly of mature antibody molecules into the correct quaternary structure . [ 155 ] It has been shown that BiP binds temporarily to the variable domain of certain light chains to assist in folding and to remove improperly folded chains from the secretory pathway . [ 167 ] Properly folded immunoglobulin light chains can be secreted from the ER without association to the heavy chain . [ 189 ] In contrast , BiP retains unassembled heavy chains inside the ER and prevents their secretion or transport to the cell surface . [ 157 ] While the interaction with the constant region domains of heavy chains ( C H 2 , C H 3 ) is also transient , [ 153 ] BiP remains bound to the ﬁrst constant domain of the heavy chain ( C H 1 ) in the absence of light chain synthesis . [ 157 ] Maybe for this reason the light chains are expressed in excess of the heavy chains , to ensure high rates of heavy chain incorporation into the oligomeric complex . Despite the highly similar three dimensional structure of all antibody domains inves - tigated so far , the C H 1 domain varies signiﬁcantly from other immunoglobulin domains in respect of stable BiP binding . Due to the nature of BiP to recognize hydrophobic peptide sequences , the C H 1 domain must be either intrinsically unfolded or incom - pletely folded or the folded C H 1 domain possesses exposed hydrophobic residues before assembly with the light chain . 4 . 1 . 2 Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Protein folding has attracted enormous research eﬀort for many years now and discov - ering the underlying mechanism is one of the major challenges of modern science . In the early 1960s Anﬁnsen suggested , based on the experimental experience that pro - teins fold reversibly , that native structures of globular proteins are thermodynamically stable states and therefore conformations at the global minima of their accessible free energies . [ 190 , 191 ] However , already a few years later Levinthal remarked that there are too many possible conformations for proteins to ﬁnd the native structure within the whole conformational space by random searching . [ 192 ] This argumentation , called ’Levinthal’s paradox’ , led to the assumption that proteins must fold by speciﬁc ’folding pathways’ . [ 193 ] These two approaches diﬀer fundamentally , as Anﬁnsen proposed a ther - modynamically controlled folding mechanism which means that a protein reaches its global minimum in energy and that folding is pathway independent but time consum - ing due to the extensive search . In contrast , Levinthal favored a kinetically controlled mechanism depending on the pathway and hence resulting in a fast folding process but as a consequence the proteins may only reach local minima and display variable ﬁnal structures . In recent years a new model arose which has revolutionized our understanding of the protein folding process . As folding of a polypeptide chain does not involve starting from one speciﬁc conformation , the new perspective replaces the pathway concept of sequential events with the funnel concept of parallel events . [ 194 – 196 ] In this case , indi - vidual chains move asynchronous , each adopting diﬀerent conformations . However , as the folding chains progress toward lower intrachain free energies their conformational 57 Chapter 4 The C H 1 Domain Controls the Secretion of IgG Molecules Figure 4 . 3 : Schematic folding funnel with indicated regions for molten globules and transition states . The width of the funnel represents the entropy , the depth of the funnel relates to the native energy and the slope of the folding funnel provides an indication of the velocity of the folding process . Q corresponds to the fraction of native contacts correctly made . On its way to the native structure , the protein may be transiently trapped by any local minimum . This eﬀect of ruggedness of the funnel landscape slows down the diﬀusion through the conformational space . The rate of ﬁnding the folded state depends on the conformational diﬀusion rate as well as the free energy barriers arising from the tradeoﬀ between energy and entropy . options increasingly narrow and ﬁnally result in one native structure . Its most impor - tant point , namely the prerequisite that protein folding proceeds via multiple routes going downhill rather than a single pathway , has immediately elegantly shown a way out of the long standing Levinthal paradox . This new model of ’folding funnels’ or ’energy landscapes’ ( Fig . 4 . 3 ) assumes that the natural ﬂuctuations in the conformation of an unfolded or incompletely folded polypep - tide chain enable even residues that are highly separated in the amino acid sequence to come into contact to one other . [ 105 , 117 , 197 ] Because in the majority of cases native like interactions are more stable than non - native ones , each polypeptide chain is able to ﬁnd its lowest energy structure by a process of trial and error . Moreover , many studies indicate that the fundamental mechanism of protein folding involves the interaction of a relatively small number of residues to form a folding nucleus . [ 197 – 199 ] Interactions of these key residues force the polypeptide chain to adopt an overall topology comparable to the native fold . Once the correct topology has been achieved , the native structure will almost invariably emerge during the ﬁnal stages of folding ( Fig . 4 . 4 ) . Conversely , if these key interactions are not established , the protein cannot fold to a stable globular structure . 58 4 . 1 Introduction Figure 4 . 4 : Schematic energy landscape for protein folding . [ 105 ] An ensemble of distinct conforma - tions of unfolded polypeptide chains ﬁnds its lowest energy structure by a process of trial and error . Depending on the shape of the landscape , only a small number of all possible conformations needs to be sampled , enabling a few key residues to come into contact and forming a folding nucleus . When these residues ( depicted in yellow in the transition state ) form their native like contacts , the overall topology of the native state is established . This transition state still consists of an ensemble of struc - tures reﬂecting the multiple pathways of protein folding . After reaching this saddle point , the native structure will almost invariably be generated during the ﬁnal stages of folding . 59 Chapter 4 The C H 1 Domain Controls the Secretion of IgG Molecules Hence the question raises , what distinguishes a protein that navigates with re - markable ease through a complicated energy landscape to its native structure from a polypeptide chain that gets lost in this landscape unable to reach its native fold in a reasonable period of time . The most realistic model of a protein is a minimally frustrated polypeptide with a rugged funnel like landscape biased toward the native structure . [ 200 ] This folding landscape is necessarily rugged because biomolecules can sample many conformations during their motions and have the possibility of making inappropriate contacts between residues . For a unique native state to be thermody - namically stable , conformations structurally similar to this global minimum must be thermodynamically favored over dissimilar ones . For the global minimum to be ki - netically accessible , the states that are low in energy must be dissimilar in structure . These states act as traps during the folding process . Heteropolymers with randomly chosen amino acid sequences have rough energy landscapes because of conﬂicts be - tween various interactions between the residues . [ 200 ] It is believed that sequences of foldable proteins must be non - random to the extent that in the sampled conformations these conﬂicts are locally minimized . This so called ’principle of minimal frustration’ suggests that folded proteins have an energy landscape that is not too rough and in which , on average , the energy decreases the more the molecule resembles the native structure . [ 201 ] Polypeptides acting on this principle of minimal frustration have a con - siderably smoother energy landscape than a random heteropolymer , and in addition there are progressive forces which funnel the protein toward the native state . However , not all of the individual interactions in a protein need to be minimally frustrated for the landscape as a whole to be funneled . Even in folded proteins some frustrations from conﬂicting interactions may be present locally without aﬀecting the protein’s foldabil - ity nor its mutational robustness . [ 202 ] Yet , these frustrated interactions come along with the possibility of kinetically trapping the polypeptide chain on its way downhill the funnel to the native structure . Rapid search through the folding landscape aimed toward the speciﬁc native structure requires the landscape to have an overall gradient that is large compared to the local ruggedness . [ 203 ] In the case the local ruggedness exceeds the slope of the funnel , forces guiding the protein toward the native state di - minish . Accordingly , the protein is stuck in the rough landscape and not able to reach its native fold in a reasonable period of time . This highly rugged landscape corresponds to the energy landscape of an intrinsically unfolded protein . [ 204 ] As the shape of the energy landscape is encoded by the amino acid sequence , the ability of a protein to navigate successfully through the complicated energy landscape is determined by its primary amino acid sequence . For many years now there has been a common conviction in structural biology that a folded protein structure is essential for biological function . Of course protein structure and function are intimately connected , but the awareness that not all biologically func - tional proteins fold spontaneously into stable globular structures gains in importance . An extensive bioinformatic survey revealed that intrinsically disordered proteins are rather a general feature than a rare exception . [ 205 , 206 ] Due to the persistence of se - quences encoding natively unfolded proteins throughout evolution , these non - globular 60 4 . 1 Introduction Figure 4 . 5 : Schematic illustration of the ’ﬂy casting’ mechanism . A partially structured or unstruc - tured protein has a greater capture radius than a folded protein with its limited ﬂexibility . Therefore , the partially folded ensemble is already able to form a few initial contacts to the binding site while the folded structure remains out of range because of the smaller ﬂuctuations in the folded state . Although these initial contacts are weak , if they are native like , the disordered chain can complete folding and binding simultaneously . Accordingly , the speed of association is enhanced for a natively unstructured protein . structures seem to play a pivotal role in cellular biology . [ 207 ] Originally , biomolecular recognition processes were illustrated as the association of folded proteins that dock as rigid bodies , known as the ’lock and key’ mechanism . [ 41 ] Another more complex model proposed for biomolecular recognition is based on the formation of an encounter complex that undergoes small local conformational changes to optimize the initial in - teractions , named the ’induced ﬁt’ mechanism . [ 208 ] As it turns out that many cellular proteins appear to be partially or even completely unstructured under native condi - tions , but form a perfectly ordered structure in the presence of the appropriate ligand , the mechanism of ’folding upon binding’ describes a further possibility for biomolecular recognition . [ 209 , 210 ] In this case the disordered polypeptide chain forms an encounter complex with a rigid protein and generates random binding contacts with the surface of the folded protein while staying unfolded itself . If the energy landscape for binding is strongly funneled and consequently correlated with the folding landscape , the disor - dered polypeptide chain folds upon binding . Otherwise , if the binding interactions are non - native and therefore not strong enough to induce a funnel like folding landscape , the complex dissociates . [ 211 ] Since intrinsically disordered proteins always run the risk of being degraded within the cell , there must be physiological advantages for the use of unstructured proteins that only fold upon reaching their targets as biomolecular recognition process . On the one hand , natively unfolded proteins are more adaptive thus possessing the capability 61 Chapter 4 The C H 1 Domain Controls the Secretion of IgG Molecules to bind to several distinct targets as well as to overcome steric clashes . [ 212 , 213 ] On the other hand , these extended polypeptide chains are able to form complexes with large interfaces . To achieve a comparable extensive interface , a stably folded protein would have to increase in size immensely . [ 214 ] As a consequence , disordered proteins provide a simple solution for having large intermolecular interfaces while maintaining a small genome . Furthermore , the ’ﬂy casting’ mechanism postulates a kinetic advantage for being initially unfolded before binding . [ 215 ] A partially structured or unstructured protein has a greater capture radius than a folded protein with its limited ﬂexibility for a speciﬁc binding site , thereby enhancing the speed of association ( Fig . 4 . 5 ) . 4 . 2 Investigation of the Structural Characteristics of the C H 1 Domain The biological activity of IgG molecules depends on proper assembly into the cor - rect quaternary structure . For this reason , the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) possesses an elaborate assembly control mechanism which ensures the association of two heavy and two light chains into a functional antibody molecule prior to secretion from the ER . [ 153 , 154 ] An essential process within this complex control mechanism is the retention of unassembled heavy chains in the ER by interaction with the molecular chaperone BiP . [ 153 , 156 ] It is known that the ﬁrst constant domain of the heavy chain , the C H 1 domain , plays a crucial role in this retention process . [ 153 , 155 ] Hence , investigation of the structural characteristics of the C H 1 domain might reveal further insights into the secretion control mechanism . 4 . 2 . 1 The Unassembled C H 1 Domain is Natively Unfolded In the context of the whole antibody molecule , the C H 1 domain adopts the typical immunoglobulin fold and associates with the constant domain of the light chain C L . [ 46 ] Surprisingly , the isolated C H 1 domain from a murine IgG1 , despite its ability to form its intrinsic disulﬁde bridge , is a natively unfolded protein . This is in marked contrast to all antibody domains studied so far . [ 160 , 161 , 216 , 217 ] Besides the typical random coil CD spectrum , the isolated C H 1 domain also displays a 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectrum characteristic of an unstructured protein ( Fig . 4 . 6 ) . More - over , the intensities of the HSQC peaks diﬀer signiﬁcantly , thus indicating distinct dynamical properties within the protein . In the case of the C H 1 domain , decreasing the temperature resulted in altered backbone dynamics in this respect that the amide resonances show less line broadening and consequently the spectral quality increased considerably . As the carbon chemical shifts predominantly depend on the amino acid type itself , the dispersion in the carbon dimensions is suﬃcient for the assignment of the backbone resonances even in unstructured proteins . The backbone resonances of the isolated C H 1 domain ( 98 AA ) were assigned at 12 ◦ C , due to the favorable dynamical characteristics at lower temperatures and consistent with the real time measurements 62 4 . 2 Investigation of the Structural Characteristics of the C H 1 Domain F i g u r e 4 . 6 : 1 H - 15 N H S Q C s p ec t r u m o f t h e i s o l a t e d C H 1 d o m a i n ( 98 AA ) r ec o r d e d a t a t e m p e r a t u r e o f 12 ◦ C a nd a p r o t o n f r e q u e n c y o f 90 0 M H z .

Despite the unfolded nature , an assignment of 77 % of the backbone resonances was achieved ( 67 residues out of 87 non - proline residues ) . Interestingly , the HSQC spec - trum of the reduced C H 1 domain is identical to the one of the oxidized C H 1 domain , except for slight changes in the chemical shifts of the cysteines themselves and the directly adjacent residues . Hence , the unassembled C H 1 domain is natively unfolded irrespective of the formation of the internal disulﬁde bridge . Analysis of the carbon chemical shifts according to the chemical shift index ( CSI , section 3 . 2 . 2 ) indicates no existence of secondary structure elements within the isolated C H 1 domain . Nevertheless , it is assumed that even unstructured proteins are structured in terms of formation of a hydrophobic core or transient interactions . HetNOE data of the unfolded C H 1 domain suggest that the unassembled C H 1 exists as an ensemble of relatively ﬂexible structures experiencing ﬂuctuations comparable to those of disordered regions in folded proteins . To gain information about any preferential conformations present in the disordered C H 1 domain , NOESY spectra on a highly deuterated sam - ple were recorded . Deuteration substantially lengthens the relaxation times of carbon and proton spins in proximity to the substituted deuterons , [ 218 ] due to the lower gy - romagnetic ratio of deuterons relative to that of protons ( γ H / γ D ≈ 6 . 5 ) . This slower decay of the diagonal peak intensity as a function of mixing times enables an increase in the sensitivity of NOESY experiments through the use of longer mixing times . [ 219 ] However , the drawback of complete deuteration for NOESY experiments is that only NOEs between exchangeable protons which means predominantly amide protons can be observed . Still , long mixing time NOESY spectra recorded on perdeuterated unfolded proteins allow observation of longer range H N - H N NOEs belonging to only a subset of conformers even though these cross peaks are relatively weak due to the low popula - tion and the dynamic properties . [ 220 ] Yet , measurement of NNH - and HNH - NOESY spectra with a mixing time of 600 ms on the highly deuterated disordered C H 1 domain in aqueous PBS buﬀer could not detect any long range NOEs . Instead , an exchange with protons from the aqueous buﬀer is observed for all residues . Consequently , the unfolded state of C H 1 seems to be an ensemble of relatively ﬂexible conformations lack - ing speciﬁc amide - amide contacts or hydrogen bonds . As the disulﬁde bridge present in the unfolded state brings at least some residues in close proximity , these might just interact by their hydrophobic side chains . Study of possible hydrophobic interactions and the required assignment of the aliphatic and aromatic side chains is still under progress . Despite a not yet available detailed picture of the unfolded C H 1 domain , the intrinsi - cally disordered nature already provides a rationale for the strong interaction with the chaperone BiP and the pivotal role of this domain in retaining the unassembled heavy chain in the ER . 64 4 . 2 Investigation of the Structural Characteristics of the C H 1 Domain 4 . 2 . 2 Association coupled Folding of the C H 1 Domain In contrast to the unassembled C H 1 domain , in the presence of the C L domain , the cognate association partner of C H 1 in the complete antibody molecule , the C H 1 domain folds to its characteristic greek key β - barrel topology . However , this association coupled folding process depends on the redox status of the C H 1 domain 1 . Reduced C H 1 is not able to assemble with C L , as evidenced by anisotropy measurements of Lucifer yellow labeled C L where no change in anisotropy was observed upon addition of reduced C H 1 as compared to oxidized C H 1 . Therefore , the internal disulﬁde bridge is prerequisite for the association of the C H 1 domain with the C L domain and consequently for inducing structure formation in C H 1 . Backbone Assignment Since the unfolded state and the folded state of the C H 1 domain are in slow exchange , the peaks of the backbone resonances of the unfolded state disappear during the folding process while the peaks corresponding to the folded state appear at diﬀerent positions . Therefore , the backbone resonances of the structured C H 1 domain have to be newly assigned . To ensure complete structure formation in C H 1 , twofold excess of unlabeled C L was added to 15 N respectively 15 N , 13 C labeled C H 1 and incubated for at least 6 h at room temperature prior to the NMR measurements . For the backbone assignment the standard triple resonance experiments ( Section 3 . 2 . 1 ) were recorded at 25 ◦ C in order to increase the overall tumbling of the heterodimer and thus slow down the decay of mag - netization . However , the carbon chemical shifts were limited to the C’ and C α chemical shifts due to the relaxation properties of the protein complex . Although the molecular weight of around 20 kDa is not really critical for NMR measurements , the shape of the C L / C H 1 complex seems to be disadvantageous in regard to the correlation time . The increased correlation time results in an increased loss of magnetization via the H α nuclei making the magnetization transfer from the C α nuclei to the C β nuclei ineﬃcient . As the amino acid type and sequential information just based on the C’ and C α chemical shifts does not allow an unambiguous assignment of the C H 1 domain , an additional parameter is required to verify and expand the backbone resonance assignment . Due to the low stability of the heterodimer neither increasing the temperature in a range that considerably improves the relaxation properties nor deuteration of the complex provides an appropriate solution . However , the analysis of residual dipolar couplings shows an elegant way out of this challenging task . Since in the case of the C H 1 domain the crystal structure in complex with the C L domain is already available , dipolar cou - plings calculated from the known structure can be compared with experimental values . The program Mars [ 221 , 222 ] routinely includes RDCs into the backbone assignment of proteins with known structure . To achieve the necessary partial alignment of the as - sembled C H 1 domain with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld for the measurement of the 1 Since this project was conducted in collaboration with the group of Prof .

The backcalculated values for the dipolar couplings were derived from the RDC - based backbone resonance assignment by the program Mars . These values based on the known crystal structure of the assembled C H 1 domain agree quite well with the experimental N - H RDCs ( quality factor Q = 0 . 24 ; correlation factor R = 0 . 95 ) . residual dipolar couplings , non - ionic liquid crystalline media were applied to the NMR sample as published by Otting and coworkers . [ 223 ] Since the C H 1 domain associated with the C L domain displays well dispersed spectra ( Fig . 4 . 7 ) , RDC values could be extracted from 2D IPAP - HSQC spectra . These experimental N - H dipolar couplings in combination with the amino acid type and sequential information of the C’ and C α chemical shifts as well as the crystal structure of the assembled C H 1 domain ( pdb 1ors ) serve as input for the software Mars . This approach extended the backbone resonance assignment to 76 residues out of 87 non - proline residues . In addition , the considerable correlation between the backcalculated and the experimental 1 D NH couplings ( Fig . 4 . 8 ) indicates an identical structure of the C H 1 domain in complex with the C L domain in solution and in the crystal . Folding Kinetics The folded C H 1 domain possesses an unusually high number of three cis prolines . [ 110 ] The energetically almost equal trans and cis conformation of peptide bonds preceding a proline residue result in an equilibrium distribution of around 10 - 30 % cis conformation per proline residue in an unfolded polypeptide chain ( Section 3 . 2 . 3 ) . For proteins with cis prolines in the native state the required isomerization reaction from the mainly populated trans to the cis conformation is associated with a high activation energy . Whereas in vivo this peptidyl - prolyl isomerization is enzymatically catalyzed , in vitro this reaction is an intrinsically slow process . Consequently , the time frame necessitated to complete folding in vitro is shifted into an appropriate range for real time NMR spectroscopy . To resolve the speciﬁc recognition between C L and C H 1 as well as the folding pathway of the natively disordered C H 1 domain at the level of atomic resolution , 67 Chapter 4 The C H 1 Domain Controls the Secretion of IgG Molecules Figure 4 . 9 : Folding kinetics of the C H 1 domain .

For each assigned residue , changes of the amplitudes over time could be described by a single exponential function . Notably , some residues already exhibit signiﬁcant intensities in the ﬁrst spectrum recorded after 20 min . These residues can be assumed to adopt a native like conformation prior to the slow peptidyl - prolyl isomerization reaction . Mapping the residues which are part of the β - sheets that form the mature structure and are found to be in a native like environment , on the crystal structure of the C H 1 domain reveals how the association coupled folding reaction of this antibody domain might proceed ( Fig . 4 . 9 ) . Residues Thr - 22 , His - 49 , Ser - 65 , and Thr - 67 in the C H 1 domain which constitute the C L interface seem to be already correctly positioned in the encounter complex . Importantly , His - 49 and Ser - 65 are involved in hydrogen bonds with the C L domain . The interaction with C L apparently initiates the formation of a hydrophobic cluster in the C H 1 domain comprised of Val - 21 , Val - 68 , Trp - 73 , and Val - 78 . Thus , a few key interactions between C L and C H 1 establish an interface between the two domains which allows the formation of a hydrophobic folding nucleus in the C H 1 domain and subsequently prolyl isomerization paves the path to the native state . 4 . 3 Insights into the Secretion Control Mechanism Although association coupled folding of the C H 1 domain is accordingly an intrinsic feature of this natively unfolded protein , in the cell folding , assembly , and subsequent secretion of IgG molecules involves additional factors . [ 224 ] The molecular chaperone BiP that is present in high concentrations in the ER plays an important role in retaining the unassembled heavy chain in the ER . [ 154 , 155 ] As BiP recognizes speciﬁc hydrophobic hep - tapeptides in extended conformations which are characteristic of partially structured or completely unstructured proteins , this process of retention is mainly based on the in - teraction of the intrinsically unfolded C H 1 domain with the chaperone . After synthesis of the polypeptide chain by the ribosome , the C H 1 domain of the unassembled heavy chain remains in a reduced state . [ 225 ] According to analytical HPLC experiments , BiP forms stable complexes with the reduced C H 1 domain as well as with the oxidized C H 1 domain , although with slightly less aﬃnity . This indicates that the oxidation of the C H 1 domain could in principle take place in the BiP bound state . Since reduced C H 1 does not bind to C L ( Section 4 . 2 . 2 ) nor could association of C L to BiP bound C H 1 be detected ( Fig . 4 . 10 ) , the data allow to establish an order of events for the reaction between BiP , C H 1 , and C L . It is most likely that in vivo the C H 1 domain early binds to BiP as it enters the ER cotranslationally in a reduced state . Then , triggered by association with the light chain , and presumably controlled by additional components of the Ig assembly machinery , [ 154 , 224 , 226 ] the oxidation of the internal disulﬁde bridge between Cys - 25 and Cys - 80 takes place which brings at least two of the residues ( Val - 21 and Val - 78 ) that are involved in the formation of the hydrophobic folding nucleus in close proximity to each other . [ 111 ] Only after release from the chaperone , oxidized C H 1 69 Chapter 4 The C H 1 Domain Controls the Secretion of IgG Molecules Figure 4 . 10 : Veriﬁcation of the formation of triple complexes between BiP , C H 1 , and C L .

In vivo studies found that the C H 1 domain stays in the reduced state prior to light chain association . [ 154 , 225 ] It is conceivable that in the ER light chain association , oxidation , and folding of C H 1 are tightly coupled by additional components of the as - sembly machinery , [ 224 ] as the cell based experiments did not allow a temporal dissection of the events . [ 225 ] In the readily assembled antibody molecule , the C L domain and the C H 1 domain are covalently cross - linked via an intermolecular disulﬁde bridge . Once this disulﬁde bridge is formed , it abolishes binding of C H 1 to BiP as evidenced in vitro by analytical HPLC experiments and thereby renders the association process between C L and C H 1 irreversible . In addition , since the formation of this disulﬁde bridge de - pends on proper folding of C H 1 , only incorrectly or incompletely folded C H 1 domains re - associate with BiP . This comprehensive model puts the unexpected intrinsically unfolded nature of the C H 1 domain at the center of the secretion control mechanism of murine IgG antibodies . Therefore , the assumption that the general folding status of an antibody domain is governing retention in the ER and strong binding to BiP was further analyzed in vivo 2 . For this purpose , various immunoglobulin chain constructs were transiently expressed in the established eukaryotic COS cell line . This african green monkey kidney ﬁbroblast line was metabolically labeled with 35 S methionine and cysteine respectively . Secreted immunoglobulin chains were immunoprecipitated from the expression medium , whereas immunoglobulin chains retained in the ER and also the ER speciﬁc chaperone BiP were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate . Subsequently , analyzed SDS - polyacrylamide gels were exposed to XAR ﬁlms to detect the 35 S labeled proteins . To support the theory that the intrinsically unfolded nature of C H 1 is regulatory for secretion control , the C L domain in the light chain was replaced by the C H 1 domain . This light chain now behaved like a heavy chain in terms of retention in the ER and interaction with BiP . This shows that the structural characteristics of the C H 1 domain and its role in antibody retention are intrinsic , context independent features . To more directly address the structural prerequisites for antibody retention , the small helical el - ements of the C L domain which have been reported to play a crucial role in the folding of this domain ( Chapter 3 ) , were exchanged against the corresponding elements of the C H 1 domain which themselves have not been classiﬁed as BiP binding sequences . [ 227 ] This exchange transformed the C L domain into a natively unfolded protein . An anti - body light chain containing the altered C L domain strongly interacted with BiP in vivo and was no longer secreted from the ER , arguing that the folding status of an antibody domain is key for its retention and that the transplanted residues might play a role in the folding properties of the C H 1 domain . 2 In vivo experiments were carried out by Dr . Yuichiro Shimizu , a postdoctoral fellow in the group of Prof . Dr . Linda Hendershot , Department of Genetics and Tumor Cell Biology , St . Jude Children’s Research Hospital , Memphis , USA . 71 Chapter 4 The C H 1 Domain Controls the Secretion of IgG Molecules Figure 4 . 11 : Secretion control mechanism of IgG antibodies . After synthesis of the polypeptide chain by the ribosome , the C H 1 domain of the heavy chain ( blue ) enters the ER in a reduced state . Due to its intrinsically unfolded nature , the C H 1 domain stably binds to the ER speciﬁc chaperone BiP ( gray ) . This interaction involves cycles of binding and release from the chaperone which enables the assembly with the C L domain of the light chain ( green ) during the release cycle . Since reduced C H 1 does not associate with C L nor does C L interact with BiP bound C H 1 , the oxidation of the internal disulﬁde bridge is most likely controlled by additional components of the Ig assembly machinery . After release from the chaperone BiP , the oxidized C H 1 domain can complete its folding in association with the C L domain . Once C H 1 is properly folded , formation of the intermolecular disulﬁde bridge which covalently cross - links the C L domain and the C H 1 domain takes place . This renders the assembly of the heavy chain and the light chain irreversible and allows the secretion of the antibody molecule from the ER . 72 4 . 4 Discussion 4 . 4 Discussion Investigation of the structural properties of the C H 1 domain discovered unexpected characteristics . In general , the individual domains of an immunoglobulin molecule adopt highly similar three dimensional structures and fold to their native state au - tonomously . [ 160 , 161 , 216 ] Interestingly , the isolated C H 1 domain of the murine IgG1 an - tibody is an intrinsically unfolded protein , despite its capability to form its internal disulﬁde bridge . Since oxidation of this disulﬁde bridge could still take place in the BiP bound state , BiP seems to preserve C H 1 in an association competent state rather than directly promoting the association reaction with C L . After release from BiP , C H 1 gains the typical immunoglobulin fold upon assembly with C L , a reaction that turns irreversible by the formation of the interchain disulﬁde bridge . This association cou - pled folding reaction proceeds via a partially structured encounter complex . A detailed NMR spectroscopic analysis of the underlying pathway suggests that the reaction is initiated by the recognition of a few key interface residues between the C L domain and the C H 1 domain which then promotes the formation of a hydrophobic folding nucleus in the C H 1 domain . Both reactions render each other energetically more favorable and thereby allow the entropically demanding structuring of an unfolded polypeptide chain . As for most antibodies secretion of isolated light chains as well as heavy chains devoid of the C H 1 domain can take place , the essential control step for the overall IgG assembly seems to be realized in the C H 1 / C L interaction . Taken together , these data provide a detailed molecular mechanism by which BiP and a natively unfolded antibody domain control the secretion of murine IgG1 antibodies . A rigorous assembly control mechanism is of particular importance for antibody molecules which pass through asynchronous expression rates of heavy and light chains depending on the distinct developmental states of the lymphocytes . B cells arise from precursors in the bone marrow , so called pre - B cells . These pre - B cells rearrange heavy chain genes ﬁrst which are largely retained in the cell and undergo rapid degradation [ 228 ] except for a limited number that assembles with the surrogate light chain . [ 229 ] The de - velopmentally more mature B cells also produce light chains which assemble with the heavy chains and allow their transport to the cell surface . Finally , the terminally dif - ferentiated plasma cells produce enormous quantities of Ig molecules [ 230 ] that must be appropriately assembled to bind speciﬁcally to antigens and fulﬁll their eﬀector func - tions . In vivo studies indicate that the control mechanism for all Ig isotypes focuses on the C H 1 domain which counteracts immature secretion . [ 157 , 231 , 232 ] For secretion of mature antibody molecules the C H 1 domain has to assemble with the C L domain and adopt the characteristic immunoglobulin fold . This association coupled folding reac - tion of C H 1 in complex with C L additionally requires disulﬁde bridge formation and peptidyl - prolyl isomerization , reactions that are readily accelerated by the ER folding machinery . [ 152 , 224 , 233 , 234 ] Association of C H 1 with either BiP or C L are concentration dependent reactions and consequently will not become rate limiting at the high an - tibody and chaperone concentrations in the ER . Hence , the nature of the reactions governing C H 1 folding and assembly with C L allow eﬃcient yet accurate assembly of 73 Chapter 4 The C H 1 Domain Controls the Secretion of IgG Molecules antibodies prior to secretion and hint towards the co - evolution of substrates and folding helpers in the ER . These data not only provide novel insights into antibody assembly control but furthermore extend the growing class of natively unfolded proteins [ 209 , 235 ] by a prominent member of the immunoglobulin superfamily . Since C H 1 does not possess the typical sequence signature of an intrinsically disordered protein , [ 236 , 237 ] it might be the ﬁrst representative of a novel type of natively unfolded proteins . The large number of proline residues in C H 1 , e . g . in a helical part of the molecule which was identiﬁed as important for antibody domain folding might be one determinant of its unfolded nature . From the evolutionary point of view , the C H 1 domain has experienced a di - vergent evolutionary fate dependent on its folding and homodimerization properties . One of the oldest adaptive immune systems based on antibody molecules is found in sharks . Their antibody molecules assemble only from heavy chains that consist of single C H 1 homologous domains . [ 238 ] In contrast , the heavy - chain - only antibody molecules of camels are devoid of the C H 1 domain . [ 159 ] How the unexpected biophysical properties of this protein have evolved in diﬀerent species to fulﬁll speciﬁc biological functions remains a challenging subject of current research . 74 Chapter 5 pH Dependent Talin Binding to Actin Promotes FA Remodeling Vitally important for most anti - pathogen immune responses is the rapid production of antibody molecules . Yet , B cells speciﬁc for any given antigen are exceedingly rare , sometimes as few as one cell in a million . [ 239 ] For this reason , B cells have to ensure an eﬃcient survey for their speciﬁc antigen . Naive B lymphocytes , B cells that have not yet encountered an antigen , continually enter the secondary lymphoid organs from the bloodstream . These secondary lymphoid organs are strategically positioned to sample antigens that enter through almost any body surface , the spleen ﬁlters antigens from the blood , lymph nodes ﬁlter lymph draining from skin or mucosal surfaces . After randomly migrating through a lymphoid organ without detecting a cognate antigen , B cells return to the circulation and move on to survey further lymphoid organs . [ 240 ] In contrast , upon antigen encounter cell migration undergoes rapid changes . Rather than migrating randomly , B cells now migrate with directional preference , pair with antigen speciﬁc helper T cells , and become antibody secreting plasma cells . [ 241 ] This whole process of an eﬀective immune response decisively depends on the migratory properties of the cells . As in general cell migration is a central process in the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms , elucidation of the underlying mechanism has attracted great interest . It is assumed that the rate limiting step in cell migration is the binding of actin ﬁlaments to the focal adhesion ( FA ) associated proteins that stabilize the adhesions be - tween the cell and the substrate . At the leading edge of migrating cells , focal adhesions undergo rapid cycles of assembly and turnover , creating and disrupting , respectively , sites of traction necessary for forward movement of the cell body . Force generation for traction requires linkage among the extracellular matrix , integrin receptors , and the actin cytoskeleton . Actin ﬁlaments do not directly bind to the cytoplasmic domain 75 Chapter 5 pH Dependent Talin Binding to Actin Promotes FA Remodeling of integrins but bind to integrin associated focal adhesion proteins such as talin . [ 242 ] Although F - actin binding by talin is known to be pH sensitive in vitro , with lower aﬃnity at higher pH , [ 243 , 244 ] the functional signiﬁcance of this pH dependence remains unclear . Because increased intracellular pH ( pH i ) promotes cell migration [ 245 , 246 ] and is a hallmark of metastatic carcinomas , [ 247 ] the question arises whether it increases FA remodeling through lower aﬃnity talin actin binding . Talin contains several actin bind - ing sites , [ 248 ] however only the C - terminal USH - I / LWEQ module binds actin in a pH dependent manner , with lower aﬃnity and decreased maximal binding at higher pH . NMR spectroscopic investigations of this talin module revealed a structural mechanism for pH dependent actin binding . A cluster of titratable amino acids with upshifted pK a values , including His - 2418 , was identiﬁed at one end of the ﬁve helix bundle distal from the actin binding site . Protonation of this histidine residue induces changes in the conformation and dynamics of the remote actin binding site . Furthermore in motile ﬁ - broblasts , increasing pH i decreased FA lifetime and increased the migratory rate . These data suggest a molecular mechanism for pH sensitive actin binding by talin and indi - cate that FA turnover is pH dependent and in part mediated by pH dependent aﬃnity of talin for binding actin . 5 . 1 Introduction 5 . 1 . 1 Cell Migration Cell migration is an essential prerequisite for many physiological and pathophysiologi - cal processes . Already the origin of life requires cell migration shortly after conception to enable the morphogenesis throughout embryonic development . Also in adult life , cell movement continues to play an extremely important role in processes such as tissue repair and immune surveillance . For an eﬃcient immune response , the leukocytes have to migrate from the circulation into the surrounding tissue to destroy invading microor - ganisms and infected cells . [ 239 ] After accompanying us throughout the whole life , cell migration even contributes to our death . Migration is involved in several pathological processes , including vascular diseases , chronic inﬂammatory diseases , and cancer . [ 249 ] Hence , understanding the fundamental mechanism underlying cell migration holds the promise of eﬀective therapeutic approaches for treating diseases . From the present point of view cell migration can be illustrated as a cyclic process . [ 250 ] The initial response of a cell to a migration promoting agent is to polarize and extend protrusions in the direction of migration ( Fig . 5 . 1 ) . These protrusions are stabilized by adhering to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) or adjacent cells via transmembrane receptors linked to the actin cytoskeleton . The adhesions at the cell front serve as traction sites for migration , whereas the adhesions at the cell rear disassemble , allowing the cell to move forward . The basic requirement for cell migration is the polarization of the cell , which means that the distribution of signaling molecules and the cytoskeleton is asymmetrical be - 76 5 . 1 Introduction Figure 5 . 1 : Schematic illustration of a migrating cell . The initial response of a cell to an extracellular stimuli is to polarize and extend protrusions in the direction of migration . Polarization of the cell means asymmetrical distribution of signaling molecules and the cytoskeleton between the front and the rear of a moving cell . In addition , polarity is also aﬀected by localizing the microtubule - organizing center ( MTOC ) and the Golgi apparatus in front of the nucleus which facilitates microtubule growth into the lamellipodia and delivery of Golgi derived vesicles to the leading edge providing membrane and associated proteins required for forward protrusion . These protrusions are stabilized by adhering to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) or adjacent cells via transmembrane receptors linked to the actin cytoskeleton . The adhesions at the cell front serve as traction sites for migration , whereas the adhesions at the cell rear disassemble , allowing the cell to move forward . tween the front and the back of a moving cell . Establishing and maintaining cell polarity in response to extracellular stimuli seems to be arranged among other components by integrins , microtubules , and vesicular transport . Cells are able to respond direction - ally to marginal diﬀerences in concentrations of migration promoting agents . [ 251 ] This shallow gradient between the front and the rear of the cell needs to be intensiﬁed into steeper intracellular signaling gradients in order to initiate a cellular response . Several signaling molecules exist that accumulate at the leading edge of the cell stimulated by a extracellular chemoattractant and thereby activate further molecules involved in this complex regulatory machinery . [ 251 , 252 ] Molecules downstream the regulatory pathway can in return activate the signaling molecules , and additionally stabilize microtubules as well as induce recruitment and clustering of activated integrins at the leading edge of the cell to form new adhesions . [ 253 – 255 ] To ensure a directional migration rather than a random movement the cell possesses mutual antagonists that suppress each others activity . [ 256 ] Molecules activated by the extracellular chemoattractant accumulate at the leading edge of the cell suppressing their antagonists , whereas the antagonists lo - calize at the sites and the rear of the cell thus preventing protrusion at sites other than the leading edge . [ 257 , 258 ] 77 Chapter 5 pH Dependent Talin Binding to Actin Promotes FA Remodeling The actual protrusive event is assumed to occur not just by elongation of the actin ﬁlaments but by a mechanism , in which thermal energy bends the nascent short ﬁla - ments . Unbending of an elongated ﬁlament against the leading edge of the cell provides the driving force for pushing the membrane forward . [ 259 ] In this protrusion process dis - tinct actin binding proteins govern the actin polymerization . The pool of available monomers and free ends is regulated by proteins that prevent self - nucleation of actin monomers , restrict polymerization of new ﬁlaments close to the membrane , and disas - semble older ﬁlaments into actin monomers which are required for the polymerization at the front end . [ 259 , 260 ] After a protrusion has formed , it has to be stabilized by attaching to the surround - ings . Many diﬀerent receptors contribute to the adhesion , however integrins play the leading part . Integrins are heterodimeric receptors consisting of α and β chains with large ligand binding extracellular domains and short cytoplasmic domains , thus pro - viding a linkage between the extracellular matrix and via adaptor proteins the actin ﬁlaments on the inside of the cell ( Fig . 5 . 2 ) . Interactions of the cytoplasmic tail with the cytoskeletal linker protein talin alters the conformation of the integrin extracellular domains thereby activating the integrins which preferentially localize to the leading edge of the cell to form new adhesions . [ 261 , 262 ] Migrating cells can be distinguished according to the extent of their integrin clusters ( ’focal adhesions’ ) between rapidly migrating ones , such as leukocytes which possess few integrin clusters and cells with large integrin clusters that are either non - migratory or move very slowly . Besides the density of adhesion receptors on the cell , the migration velocity and hence the strength of cell attachment is determined by the density of adhesive ligands on the substrate and the aﬃnity of the receptors for the adhesive ligands . [ 250 ] In addition to connecting the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton , integrins also transfer infor - mation about the physical state of the ECM into the cell and correspondingly vary the cytoskeletal dynamics . [ 263 , 264 ] At the rear of migrating cells , adhesions must disassemble to promote retraction of the tail . In ﬁbroblasts , the rearmost adhesions often tether the cell strongly to the substratum , resulting in a long tail . At any time , the tension is suﬃcient to physically break the linkage between the integrin and the actin cytoskeleton , allowing the cell to move on . [ 250 ] Integrins detached from the cytoskeleton and the ECM are , at least partially , recycled by endocytosis to the front of the cell . Furthermore , intracellular calcium levels also favor adhesion turnover at the rear . The tension generated by the strong adhesions at the back of the migrating cell can open certain calcium channels . [ 265 ] Increased intracellular calcium concentration activates the protease calpain , which has the potential to cleave several focal adhesion proteins , including integrins , talin , and vinculin . [ 266 , 267 ] Although research into the molecular basis of cell migration has progressed rapidly over the past few years , there are still many unresolved questions regarding how cells establish and maintain their polarity , how adhesions form and break , how cells migrate in vivo , and how cells recognize their targets . 78 5 . 1 Introduction Figure 5 . 2 : Schematic illustration of the linkage between integrin receptors and the actin cytoskele - ton . Talin connects actin ﬁlaments to focal adhesions directly through the C - terminal I / LWEQ domain and the N - terminal FERM domain and indirectly through the vinculin binding sites . Furthermore , talin functions not only as dynamical linkage between the cytoplasmic tail of β - integrins and the actin cytoskeleton but also increases the aﬃnity of the extracellular domain of integrins for stimuli of the ECM . [ 268 , 269 ] 5 . 1 . 2 The Focal Adhesion Protein Talin Adhesions regulate cell motility in response to extracellular cues by assembly and dis - assembly of molecular interactions between the cell and the substrate . Their structures can be classiﬁed into focal complexes , focal adhesions , and ﬁbrillar adhesions . This classiﬁcation depends on their size , shape , intracellular localization , molecular com - position , and dynamics . [ 270 – 272 ] Focal complexes disassemble and reassemble at the leading edge during protrusion in a process called focal adhesion turnover . Thus , these focal complexes are highly dynamic nascent adhesions and in the early state mainly established by β 3 - integrin , talin , and paxillin . [ 273 , 274 ] In slow moving cells , some focal complexes mature into focal adhesions . Focal adhesions localize at the cell periphery and more centrally in less motile regions . Connecting the cell body to the extracellular matrix requires more stable adhesions with slower turnover rates . These focal adhe - sions contain high levels of vinculin , talin , paxillin , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , and integrin α v β 3 . [ 274 ] However , the molecular mechanism underlying the decision of a focal complex to mature into a more stable focal adhesion or to disassemble and turnover re - mains unclear . Fibrillar adhesions can arise from focal adhesions and characteristically associate with the extracellular ﬁbronectin ﬁbrils . [ 275 ] The focal adhesion protein talin emerges as key modulator of adhesion dynamics ( Fig . 5 . 3 ) . [ 276 – 278 ] Talin is an antiparallel homodimer [ 279 ] made of a small globular head domain ( ∼ 50 kDa ) and a large elongated rod domain ( ∼ 220 kDa ) . The N - terminal FERM domain directly binds integrin α IIb , β 1 , and β 3 cytoplasmic tails , [ 280 , 281 ] FAK , [ 282 ] PIP2 , [ 283 ] and weakly to actin ﬁlaments . The rod domain contains an I / LWEQ actin ﬁlament binding site [ 248 ] as well as multiple vinculin binding sites [ 284 ] and also mediates dimerization via a C - terminal coiled coil segment . Hence , talin connects actin ﬁlaments 79 Chapter 5 pH Dependent Talin Binding to Actin Promotes FA Remodeling to focal adhesions directly through the I / LWEQ and the FERM domains and indirectly through the vinculin binding sites . Furthermore , talin functions not only as linkage between the cytoplasmic tail of β - integrins and the actin cytoskeleton but also increases the aﬃnity of the extracellular domain of integrins . [ 268 ] Talin binding to integrins disrupts an intracellular salt bridge between the α and β integrin subunits , leading to increased integrin aﬃnity , which strengthens the interaction with the ECM - a phenomenon known as ’inside out’ integrin activation . [ 285 – 287 ] In vivo studies with talin deﬁcient ﬂies revealed that in the absence of talin integrins are still able to bind the ECM , but can neither accumulate into clusters nor connect to the cytoskeleton . [ 288 ] Another approach veriﬁed that talin is the major integrin eﬀector of inside out integrin activation , since the knockdown of talin reduces integrin activation irrespective of the many distinct signaling pathways and cannot be rescued by other integrin regulators but only by the expression of an integrin activating fragment of talin . [ 262 ] Maybe due to the vital role of talin in adhesion formation and integrin activation , mammals have two highly similar isoforms of talin ( talin1 and talin2 with ∼ 74 % identity ) suggesting redundant functions . During migration , adhesions assemble and disassemble . One way to regulate dis - assembly is the cleavage of adhesion components by proteases , such as calpain . [ 289 ] Various mechanisms activate calpain in vivo , though the best known mechanism is the activation by calcium . [ 290 ] Except under pathological conditions associated with cell death , the levels of calcium required to activate calpains maximally in vitro do not exist within living cells . [ 291 ] This apparent paradox led to the assumption that other regulatory mechanisms must be able to reduce the amount of calcium needed in vivo . Diverse modes of regulation have been identiﬁed in vitro , for instance binding of phos - pholipids [ 292 ] or protein - protein interactions [ 293 ] which decrease the calcium requirement for calpains , but their relevance in vivo still has to be corroborated . Friedrich postulated another explanation for this paradox . [ 294 ] During evolution calpain proteases developed this need for high amounts of calcium as a safety device to prevent potentially destruc - tive hyperactivity and therefore it is preferable for calpains to work at much less than half maximal activity . Furthermore , multiple phosphorylation sites additionally control the activity of calpain proteases . [ 295 ] Interestingly , so far no single consensus sequence could be identiﬁed for predicting whether a protein can be proteolyzed by calpains or even where calpains cleave a known substrate . However , most substrates are cleaved in a limited fashion in disordered regions between structured domains . Several indica - tions exist , that the proteolysis of talin regulates focal adhesion turnover , which might present the principle function of calpain mediated adhesion disassembly . [ 296 ] Besides the formation of focal adhesion contacts to the extracellular matrix , [ 263 , 297 ] cell migration necessitates reorganization of the cytoskeleton , [ 298 , 299 ] activation of ion channels and transporters , [ 245 , 300 , 301 ] and membrane recycling by endo - and exocyto - sis . [ 302 , 303 ] Activity of the plasma membrane isoform of the Na + / H + exchanger , NHE1 , is a prerequisite for cell polarity , directed migration , and also contributes to cell ad - hesion . [ 304 ] Predominantly , NHE1 regulates the intracellular pH homeostasis by elec - troneutral substitution of intracellular H + for extracellular Na + thereby protecting the 80 5 . 1 Introduction Figure 5 . 3 : The focal adhesion protein talin . Talin ( 2541 residues ) is a ﬂexible antiparallel dimer that plays a decisive role in integrin mediated adhesion . The N - terminal FERM domain ( residues 86 - 400 , depicted in blue , model based on pdb 1mix ) directly binds integrin α IIb , β 1 , and β 3 cytoplasmic tails , [ 280 , 281 ] FAK , [ 282 ] PIP2 , [ 283 ] and weakly to actin ﬁlaments . The rod domain contains a highly conserved I / LWEQ actin binding site [ 248 ] ( residues 2341 - 2541 , illustrated in red , pdb 2jsw ) as well as multiple vinculin binding sites [ 284 ] ( residues 607 - 636 , 852 - 876 , and 1944 - 1969 , shown in green , pdb 2b0h ) and also mediates dimerization via a C - terminal coiled coil segment ( residues 2501 - 2541 ) . In addition , the rod domain comprises a second integrin binding site . [ 242 ] Calpain II , an isoform of the calcium activated protease , cleaves talin between residues 433 - 434 generating a small globular head domain ( ∼ 50 kDa ) and a large elongated rod domain ( ∼ 220 kDa ) . 81 Chapter 5 pH Dependent Talin Binding to Actin Promotes FA Remodeling cell from intracellular acidiﬁcation . [ 305 ] In ﬁbroblasts , NHE1 mainly localizes in lamel - lipodia regulating the intracellular pH ( pH i ) according to the stimulation by membrane receptors , such as integrins that respond to extracellular migratory cues . [ 306 , 307 ] In - creased pH i promotes the recruitment of the actin severing protein coﬁlin to the leading edge of migrating cells , where it generates an increased availability of actin monomers and consequently enables enhanced actin polymerization . [ 308 – 310 ] In addition to its role as an ion transport protein , NHE1 anchors the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma mem - brane by direct interaction with actin binding proteins . [ 245 , 311 ] Moreover , NHE1 favors the dynamic reorganization of the actin based cytoskeleton . [ 245 ] Hence , through its lo - calization and its function as cytoskeletal anchor and ion exchanger , NHE1 establishes cell polarity and directed cell migration . Remarkably , the lack of ion translocation inhibits de - adhesion resulting in trailing edges that fail to retract . Because dynamic turnover of adhesions to the ECM is essential for cell migration , the mechanisms by which adhesion complexes form and subsequently disassemble are key to cell motility . Although several mechanisms contribute to focal adhesion remod - eling in migrating cells , [ 312 ] emerging evidence indicates that talin plays a central role in the dynamic linkage between integrins and actin ﬁlaments . [ 242 , 313 ] Talin functions in distinct albeit complementary mechanisms that promote focal adhesion turnover . Namely the cleavage of talin by the protease calpain , which also modulates adhesion complex composition and likely signaling functions of talin . [ 296 ] The second mechanism is regulated talin binding to actin ﬁlaments , which is proposed to act as a clutch to control focal adhesion turnover and membrane protrusion dynamics . [ 314 , 315 ] How actin binding by talin is dynamically regulated during cell migration , however , remains unde - termined . Previous studies suggest that actin binding by talin in vitro is pH sensitive , with lower aﬃnity binding at higher pH , [ 243 , 244 ] although the functional signiﬁcance of this regulation is unknown . In motile cells , an increase in intracellular pH favors focal adhesion remodeling [ 307 , 316 ] and velocity . [ 245 , 246 ] Accordingly , it is tempting to speculate that increased pH i in motile cells might promote dynamic turnover of focal adhesions by lowering the aﬃnity of actin binding by talin . 5 . 2 Investigation of the Dynamics of the Actin Binding Site of Talin Since the N - terminal FERM domain and the C - terminal I / LWEQ domain of talin both contain actin binding sites that could mediate a clutch like action for focal adhesion remodeling , [ 248 ] the pH dependence of actin binding by each domain was analyzed by F - actin cosedimentation . This approach identiﬁed the FERM domain ( 1 - 433 ) and the I / LWEQ domain including the coiled coil dimerization segment ( 2341 - 2541 ) as pH insensitive within the physiological range of pH 6 . 5 - 7 . 5 . However , a module containing the I / LWEQ domain and the adjacent upstream helical segment ( USH ) ( 2300 - 2541 ) shows pH sensitive F - actin binding with higher aﬃnity at pH 6 . 5 compared to pH 7 . 5 . 82 5 . 2 Investigation of the Dynamics of the Actin Binding Site of Talin 5 . 2 . 1 Assignment of the pH Sensitive Actin Binding Domain of Talin As the pH sensitive actin binding module includes the coiled coil dimerization segment , this talin construct reaches a molecular weight of around 50 kDa , far beyond the opti - mal size for NMR studies . Therefore , initial NMR measurements were carried out on the talin USH - I / LWEQ domain lacking the C - terminal dimerization helix ( 2300 - 2501 ) . During the course of this study , Critchley and coworkers determined an NMR struc - ture of the talin I / LWEQ domain [ 317 ] including the USH segment and excluding the C - terminal dimerization domain ( pdb 2jsw ) . However , the construct and the temper - ature at which which the structure was determined diﬀer from the one investigated in vitro and also in vivo in this study . Since the poorly dispersed 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectrum of this relatively large , purely helical talin module ( Fig . 5 . 4 ) does not allow an unam - biguous transfer of the backbone resonances , the pH sensitive actin binding domain was newly assigned . In order to ﬁgure out the most suitable conditions for the NMR measurements at which the immense peak overlap decreases and thus the spectral quality improves , at least as much as possible , a temperature series from 22 ◦ C to 37 ◦ C and a pH series within the range of pH 6 . 0 to pH 8 . 0 was recorded . Accordingly , the backbone reso - nances of the talin USH - I / LWEQ domain ( 2300 - 2501 ) were assigned at a temperature of 32 ◦ C and a pH value of 6 . 0 recording standard triple resonance experiments and per - forming the semi - automatic assignment procedure as described in section 3 . 2 . 1 . Due to the low sequence complexity of this talin module , in some cases even the analysis of the carbon chemical shifts C’ , C α , and C β was not suﬃcient enough to achieve an un - ambiguous assignment . Purely helical proteins characteristically display a poor proton dispersion , but on the other hand the helical secondary structure possesses an advan - tageous 1 H - 1 H NOE pattern . [ 126 ] Typically , within an α - helix the short 1 H Ni - 1 H Ni + 1 distance gives rise to an intense cross peak . Consequently , recording an NNH - NOESY spectrum [ 139 ] in combination with the 15 N - HSQC - NOESY spectrum enables the iden - tiﬁcation of adjacent amino acids within the 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectrum . This approach of combining the conventional assignment procedure with the speciﬁc sequential 1 H - 1 H NOE pattern of α - helices resulted in the backbone resonance assignment of 156 residues out of 198 non - proline residues ( Fig . 5 . 4 ) . 5 . 2 . 2 Titration Studies of the Monomeric and Dimeric Talin Construct The talin USH - I / LWEQ domain contains just a single histidine residue , the only amino acid with a pK a close to the physiological range . Near this histidine there are also a number of negatively charged amino acids located which could have upshifted pK a values . These residues are conserved in mammalian talin1 but not in Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila and might form a pH sensor distal from the putative actin bind - ing site as deﬁned by mutagenesis . [ 318 ] To corroborate the hypothesis of a pH sensor 83 Chapter 5 pH Dependent Talin Binding to Actin Promotes FA Remodeling F i g u r e 5 . 4 : A ss i g n e d 1 H - 15 N H S Q C s p ec t r u m o f t h e p H s e n s i t i v e a c t i n b i nd i n g d o m a i n o f t a li n ( 202 AA ) r ec o r d e d a t a t e m p e r a t u r e o f 32 ◦ C a nd a p r o t o n f r e q u e n c y o f 800 M H z .

Increasing solvent pH from pH 6 . 5 to pH 7 . 5 according to the in vitro and in vivo experiments was associated with spectral perturbations for a subset of backbone amide resonances ( Fig . 5 . 5 ) . The residues with the largest chemical shift changes clus - ter to one area of the USH - I / LWEQ domain , the region predicted to comprise the pH sensor . Analysis of the titration curve of the H δ 2 proton of the single histidine residue indicates a pK a of 7 . 2 which is upshifted from the pK a of ∼ 6 . 5 for isolated histidine in aqueous buﬀer . [ 319 ] Due to this upshifted pK a of His - 2418 , physiological changes in the intracellular pH result in signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the fractional protonation of the histidine side chain ( ∼ 85 % protonation at pH 6 . 5 and ∼ 20 % protonation at pH 7 . 5 ) . Additionally , Asp - 2482 also shows a signiﬁcantly upshifted pK a and consequently titrates in the range from pH 6 . 5 to pH 7 . 5 as well . Even though the pK a values of the glutamic acid residues 2334 , 2342 , and 2481 likewise deviate from the one for the isolated amino acid , these shifts are not suﬃcient enough to cause considerable alter - ations in the fractional protonation within the physiological range . Still , this clearly indicates the existence of a pH sensor composed of residues with upshifted pK a values that cluster together at one end of the helical bundle and adopt distinct protonation states in response to small changes in pH i inﬂuencing the conformation of the actin binding site , located ∼ 40 ˚A away . However , the truncated 40 C - terminal residues of the I / LWEQ domain are not only proposed to form a coiled coil responsible for dimerization , but are also required for actin binding . [ 318 , 320 ] Actin cosedimentation assays conﬁrm a highly restricted aﬃnity of the monomeric talin module lacking the dimerization helix for F - actin . Therefore , to reveal possible mechanisms by which the talin USH - I / LWEQ domain binds actin in a pH dependent manner , the dimeric talin construct ( 2300 - 2541 ) was further investigated in respect of residues titratable within the physiological range of the intracellular pH . Remarkably , despite the considerable molecular weight of ∼ 50 kDa the intensity and amount of the backbone amide resonances in the 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectrum is consistent with the monomeric talin module . Although the particularly beneﬁcial shape of the homodimer provides further insights into the in vivo relevant putative pH sensor , yet the NMR experiments are limited to the amide resonances . Comparison of the amide chemical shift perturbations with pH for monomeric and dimeric USH - I / LWEQ shows almost identical changes for constructs with and without the C - terminal dimerization helix . This result suggests that the model of pH allosterically regulating the actin binding site , although based on NMR experiments with the monomeric construct , may also explain the pH dependent binding of full length , dimeric talin to actin . These titration studies point towards a mechanism in which protonation of residues that constitute the pH sensor , including His - 2418 , may modulate conformation and dynamics of distal residues in the actin binding site . 85 Chapter 5 pH Dependent Talin Binding to Actin Promotes FA Remodeling Figure 5 . 5 : pH dependent conformational changes in talin USH - I / LWEQ .

Top right : Since the truncated 40 C - terminal residues of the I / LWEQ domain are required for actin binding , chemical shift changes for the dimeric talin module were determined analogous .

Bottom left : In response to physiological pH changes the protonation states for His - 2418 and Asp - 2482 , which constitute the pH sensor along with Glu - 2334 , Glu - 2342 , and Glu - 2481 , vary and hence inﬂuence the conformation of the distal actin binding site ( residues whose mutation signiﬁcantly reduced the aﬃnity for actin are depicted in orange and respectively in red for the ones with the most pronounced eﬀects on the binding capacity [ 318 ] ) . Bottom right : Increasing solvent pH from 6 . 5 to 7 . 5 led to chemical shift perturbations for a subset of backbone amide resonances ( classiﬁed as medium with ∆ δ > 0 . 025 ppm , colored in orange and large with ∆ δ > 0 . 05 ppm , shown in red ) . Remarkably , all residues with considerable alterations in the chemical shifts cluster to one area of the ﬁve helical bundle around the residues predicted to form the pH sensor . 86 5 . 2 Investigation of the Dynamics of the Actin Binding Site of Talin 5 . 2 . 3 Conformational Coupling between the pH Sensor and the Actin Binding Site Assuming that talin possesses a pH sensor sensitive to the changes in intracellular pH which demonstrably occur during cell migration , the question remains how does this inﬂuence the actin binding site , located ∼ 40 ˚A away at the other end of the helical bundle and how or are the residues in the pH sensor at all coupled to the residues in the actin binding site through the helices of the I / LWEQ module . To get any idea about possible mechanisms underlying this signal transduction , Critchley and coworkers kindly recorded in addition to the NOESY spectra used for the structure determination another set of NOESY spectra at increased solvent pH and subsequently excluded signiﬁcant structural changes as cause for the altered aﬃnity of talin to actin at diﬀerent pH values . This leaves conformational and / or dynamical modulations as possible mechanisms of the coupling between the pH sensor and the actin binding site . Residual Dipolar Couplings Molecular dynamics , apparent in backbone and side chain mobilities , play a crucial role in protein stability and function . Although local backbone ﬂuctuations on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale can be characterized by NMR spectroscopy and also molecular simulation dynamics , slower motions in the submicrosecond to millisec - ond range remain poorly accessible . However , these slow time scales are of particular interest as functionally important biological processes , including enzyme catalysis , [ 321 ] signal transduction , [ 322 ] ligand binding , and allosteric regulation , [ 323 ] are supposed to occur in this time range . Because of the overall tumbling of the protein in aqueous solution , molecular dynamics in the time scale beyond the typical tumbling time of around 5 − 10 ns are averaged out within a small number of molecular rotations . Due to the anisotropic environment and thus the partial alignment of the protein , residual dipolar couplings provide key information for understanding protein motions in the submicrosecond to millisecond time range . [ 31 , 324 ] Even though an accurate analysis of the backbone dynamics via residual dipolar couplings requires several independent alignment media , [ 325 ] in the case of talin USH - I / LWEQ RDC measurements with one alignment medium but at diﬀerent pH values might already reveal insights into any feasible mechanism for the pH dependent actin binding . To achieve the necessary partial alignment for the measurement of the residual dipo - lar couplings , non - ionic liquid crystalline media were added to the 15 N , 13 C labeled monomeric talin USH - I / LWEQ domain ( 2300 - 2501 ) as published by Otting and cowork - ers . [ 223 ] Since the 2D 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectrum is dominated by immense peak overlap , N - H dipolar couplings have to be extracted from 3D IPAP - HNCO spectra . According to the backbone assignment , RDC measurements were carried out at 32 ◦ C and in order to characterize the coupling between the pH sensor and the actin binding site at pH 6 . 5 and pH 7 . 5 , respectively . These experimental 1 D NH couplings along with the structure of the talin USH - I / LWEQ domain ( pdb 2jsw ) serve as input for the software Pales that determines the alignment tensor by singular value decomposition . [ 326 ] Further - 87 Chapter 5 pH Dependent Talin Binding to Actin Promotes FA Remodeling Figure 5 . 6 : pH dependent residual dipolar couplings of talin USH - I / LWEQ . Partial alignment for the measurement of 1 D NH couplings was achieved with non - ionic liquid crystalline media and RDC values were extracted from IPAP - HNCO spectra . Left top : Correlation between the backcalculated and the experimental dipolar couplings at pH 6 . 5 ( R = 0 . 87 , Q = 0 . 18 ) Left middle : Correlation between the backcalculated and the experimental dipolar couplings at pH 7 . 5 ( R = 0 . 84 , Q = 0 . 23 ) Left bottom : Experimental residual dipolar couplings at pH 6 . 5 compared with the experimental 1 D NH couplings at pH 7 . 5 revealed on average just 1 . 1 ± 0 . 7 Hz deviation for the vast majority of the residues but also few amino acids that diﬀer signiﬁcantly . Right : Mapping residues associated with pH dependent couplings according to deviations > 2 . 5 Hz ( orange ) and > 5 Hz ( red ) onto the solution structure of talin USH - I / LWEQ . 88 5 . 2 Investigation of the Dynamics of the Actin Binding Site of Talin more , knowledge of the alignment tensor based on the experimental couplings and the three dimensional structure enables the backcalculation of the N - H dipolar couplings . For both pH values the experimental 1 D NH couplings agree quite well with the back - calculated ones ( correlation factor R = 0 . 87 , respectively R = 0 . 84 and quality factor Q = 0 . 18 , respectively Q = 0 . 23 for pH 6 . 5 and pH 7 . 5 respectively , Fig . 5 . 6 ) . For the vast majority of the USH - I / LWEQ residues on average the experimental residual dipolar couplings at pH 6 . 5 deviate from the experimental 1 D NH couplings at pH 7 . 5 just by 1 . 1 ± 0 . 7 Hz . However , a few amino acids show considerable diﬀerences of > 2 . 5 Hz or even > 5 Hz with variation of the solvent pH ( depicted in orange and red , respectively in the cartoon representation of the talin USH - I / LWEQ domain in Fig . 5 . 6 ) . Interestingly , mapping these residues on the solution structure of the talin module reveals an exciting pattern ( Fig . 5 . 7 ) . The amino acids associated with pH de - pendent couplings are either supposed to be involved in actin binding or located within the helix which connects the pH sensor with the actin binding site . Furthermore , the residues within this helix are all linked via hydrogen bonds . This amazing pattern tempts to speculate about a potential mechanism for the regulation of actin binding by talin . Since the single histidine is the decisive modulator of the pH sensor , signal transduction depends on the distinct protonation states of His - 2418 . Deprotonation of the side chain provides electrons for the formation of a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Ser - 2420 . This serine residue initiates the signal transfer through the helix to the remote actin binding site as its carbonyl is hydrogen bonded to the amide of Leu - 2424 . The pathway further downstream incorporates Ala - 2428 , Ala - 2432 , Ala - 2436 , Leu - 2439 , and ﬁnally reaches Lys - 2443 , one of the residues identiﬁed as fundamental for actin binding . In contrast , if the side chain of His - 2418 is protonated at pH 6 . 5 the ﬁrst hydrogen bond of this cascade is not formed and hence might result in altered mod - ulations of the distal actin binding site . The participation of Leu - 2439 and Ser - 2420 in this signaling pathway could not be conﬁrmed by the RDC measurement , because of the missing assignment for Leu - 2439 and the typically averaged coupling due to the lo - cation of Ser - 2420 in the loop region . However , the principle mechanism of dynamically transmitting information across hydrogen bonds has been extensively investigated by Blackledge and coworkers . [ 325 ] Although this long range network of dynamic correla - tions between amino acids connected via hydrogen bonds transfers information across a four stranded β - sheet , there is no plausible reason why this mechanism should not account for signal transduction through helices as well . In order to obtain another indication for this mechanism , a second RDC data set was measured and analyzed . The partial alignment was achieved the same way as described above , but in this case the 1 D C α C’ couplings were extracted from 3D IPAP - HNCO spectra . However , these RDC values show no signiﬁcant diﬀerences associated with increasing solvent pH from 6 . 5 to 7 . 5 . According to the study by Blackledge and coworkers [ 325 ] this is consistent with a signal transfer via hydrogen bonds assuming that motions about the C αi − 1 – C αi axis connecting sequential amino acids are dominant and that reorientation about orthogonal axes are less pronounced , as illustrated below . 89 Chapter 5 pH Dependent Talin Binding to Actin Promotes FA Remodeling Figure 5 . 7 : Speculation about a possible mechanism for the regulation of actin binding by talin . At pH 7 . 5 the deprotonated state of the side chain of His - 2418 enables the formation of a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Ser - 2420 . From this serine residue the information is dynamically transfered further downstream across the hydrogen bonds of Leu - 2424 , Ala - 2428 , Ala - 2432 , Ala - 2436 , Leu - 2439 , and ﬁnally reaches Lys - 2443 , one of the residues identiﬁed as fundamental for actin binding . In contrast , the protonated state of the side chain of His - 2418 at pH 6 . 5 prevents the formation of the ﬁrst hydrogen bond of this cascade and hence might result in altered modulations of the distal actin binding site . Therefore , the residues of the pH sensor might be coupled with the remote actin binding site by a long range network of dynamic correlations between amino acids connected via hydrogen bonds . The amino acids associated with pH dependent couplings are colored according to their deviations in orange for > 2 . 5 Hz and red for > 5 Hz ( on average the experimental 1 D NH couplings diﬀer just by 1 . 1 ± 0 . 7 Hz between pH 6 . 5 and pH 7 . 5 ) . 90 5 . 2 Investigation of the Dynamics of the Actin Binding Site of Talin Therefore , 1 D NH RDCs from another alignment medium might verify these backbone motions . Though , this approach is still under progress . CPMG Relaxation Dispersion Experiments Protein conformational dynamics on microsecond to millisecond time scales are also evident as chemical exchange line broadening . Increasing solvent pH from 6 . 5 to 7 . 5 is accompanied with signiﬁcant line broadening for a subset of backbone amide reso - nances . Remarkably , this decrease in peak intensity caused by conformational exchange is most pronounced for the loop region constituting the pH sensor as well as for the loop region associated with the actin binding . Another indication for motions in the slow time range comes from CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments . Conformational or chemical exchange can alter the transverse relaxation rate at sites that exhibit a change in chemical shift with the dynamic event . Consistent with the observation of just a single set of cross peaks derived from the major conformer in the 1 H - 15 N correlation spectra , conformational rearrangements from the predominant state might only occur at low levels . Typically , measurements provide information just for the extensively populated conformer . In contrast , Carr - Purcell - Meiboom - Gill ( CPMG ) based spin relaxation rates can be sensitive to the presence of minor conformers as long as the rates of interconversion are on the millisecond time scale and large chemical shift diﬀerences between the states are present . Conformational exchange on the microsecond to millisecond time scale leads to a decay of transverse signal , which however can be suppressed by application of radio frequency B 1 ﬁelds . Thus , the eﬀective decay of transverse magnetization , R 2eﬀ , decreases as a function of increasing B 1 ﬁeld strength , ν CPMG . Analysis of the relaxation dispersion proﬁles , R 2eﬀ versus ν CPMG , provides information on the kinetic ( rates of interconversion ) and the thermodynamic ( populations ) parameters describing the exchange process . To identify the sites of conformational or chemical exchange in the talin USH - I / LWEQ domain , CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments were carried out at 32 ◦ C and both pH values ( 6 . 5 and 7 . 5 ) . Dispersion proﬁles for the backbone amides were recorded at two diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld strengths corresponding to 1 H frequencies of 91 Chapter 5 pH Dependent Talin Binding to Actin Promotes FA Remodeling Figure 5 . 8 : pH dependent CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments of talin USH - I / LWEQ . An eﬀec - tive method to map allostery is the approach of equilibrium perturbation . Diﬀerences in the backbone amide relaxation dispersion at CPMG ﬁelds of 25 Hz and 1000 Hz ( ∆R 2eﬀ ) can be compared for the high aﬃnity ( pH 6 . 5 ) and the low aﬃnity ( pH 7 . 5 ) state of actin binding . Signiﬁcant deviations from the average ∆∆R 2 eﬀ value indicate residues that experience conformational ﬂuctuations . Vari - ations in the intracellular pH lead to conformational exchange in the actin binding site of the talin USH - I / LWEQ domain . 92 5 . 3 Insights into the pH Dependent Mechanism of Focal Adhesion Remodeling 500 and 800 MHz . A fully interleaved pulse sequence and also a software package for analyzing the obtained CPMG curves was kindly provided by Lewis Kay . In the case of the monomeric USH - I / LWEQ talin most of the measured proﬁles display a gentle slope , indicating that these backbone amides do not sense an exchange process . Yet , some of the CPMG curves suggest the existence of conformationally exchanging regions . However , all attempts to ﬁt these relaxation dispersion proﬁles properly were without success , hence neither the exchange rate constant nor the population of the distinct conformers could be derived from the experimental data . Ascertaining the reason for this failure and improving the pulse sequence to obtain interpretable curves is still sub - ject to current research . Even though the data do not allow a detailed description of the exchange process yet , they still provide information in terms of pH dependent equilib - rium perturbation on the backbone amide relaxation dispersion . [ 327 ] Sites experiencing conformational ﬂuctuations can be mapped by the diﬀerence in ∆R 2eﬀ between the high aﬃnity and the low aﬃnity state for actin binding . ∆R 2eﬀ corresponds to the change in R 2eﬀ at the CPMG ﬁeld strength of 25 Hz compared to 1000 Hz for pH 6 . 5 and pH 7 . 5 , respectively . The pH dependent ∆∆R 2 eﬀ presents a sensitive indicator for residues that are aﬀected by the distinct protonation states within the pH sensor . Residues with ∆∆R 2eﬀ values remarkably deviating from the average value cluster mainly to the region supposed to bind F - actin ( Fig . 5 . 8 ) . Although complete analysis of the CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments is still in progress the approach of equilibrium pertur - bation already indicates conformational exchange in the actin binding site associated with variation in the intracellular pH . 5 . 3 Insights into the pH Dependent Mechanism of Focal Adhesion Remodeling This model of pH regulated focal adhesion turnover in migrating cells based on in vitro and NMR experiments was further investigated in vivo 1 . To study the eﬀect of physi - ological changes in the intracellular pH on the lifetime of focal adhesions , experiments were carried out with ﬁbroblasts deﬁcient for the Na + / H + exchanger NHE1 but stably expressing wild type NHE1 ( WT cells ) with a pH i of ∼ 7 . 5 or a mutant NHE1 with an E266I substitution that lacks proton translocation ( E266I cells ) resulting in a pH i of ∼ 7 . 0 . [ 311 , 328 ] Focal adhesion turnover in cells migrating at the edge of a wounded monolayer was determined by real time imaging of GFP - paxillin , which localizes to focal adhesions and had similar expression rates in WT and E266I cells . The decrease in intracellular pH decreases focal adhesion turnover in extending lamellipodia and consequently increases the lifetime of focal adhesions in E266I cells ( 37 . 1 ± 3 . 2 min ) compared with WT cells ( 15 . 5 ± 1 . 1 min ) . 1 In vivo experiments were performed by Dr . Jyoti Srivastava , a postdoctoral fellow in the group of Prof . Dr . Diane Barber , Department of Cell and Tissue Biology , University of California , San Francisco , USA . 93 Chapter 5 pH Dependent Talin Binding to Actin Promotes FA Remodeling Figure 5 . 9 : pH dependent focal adhesion stability . Images from movies of ﬁbroblasts expressing GFP - paxillin which localizes to focal adhesions at the edge of a wounded monolayer . These ﬁbroblasts are deﬁcient for the Na + / H + exchanger NHE1 but either stably express wild type NHE1 ( WT cells ) and hence regulate the pH i to the physiological value of ∼ 7 . 5 or a mutant NHE1 with an E266I substitution that lacks proton translocation ( E266I cells ) resulting in a pH i of ∼ 7 . 0 . [ 311 , 328 ] Decreased pH i increases the lifetime of focal adhesions in E266I cells ( Left , 37 . 1 ± 3 . 2 min ) compared with WT cells ( Right , 15 . 5 ± 1 . 1 min ) . These in vivo studies clearly evidence that the velocity of migrating cells depends on the intracellular pH , as focal adhesion stability is signiﬁcantly increased in cells with defective H + eﬄux ( Bottom ) . To verify the assumption that the single histidine ( His - 2418 ) in the talin USH - I / LWEQ domain is the key residue in pH sensing , this histidine was substituted against a phenylalanine ( H2418F ) . Indeed , actin binding by the USH - I / LWEQ - H2418F mutant was relatively pH insensitive as conﬁrmed by F - actin cosedimentation . However , this mutant had an intermediate aﬃnity and maximal binding compared with the wild type talin construct at low and high pH . Consistent with the intermediate actin bind - ing aﬃnity of the mutant talin , the focal adhesion lifetime increased in WT cells but decreased in E266I cells . As the substitution of H2418F in talin changes focal adhesion stability , attenuating turnover in WT cells with pH i of 7 . 5 but increasing turnover in E266I cells with pH i of 7 . 0 , these data indicate that His - 2418 plays a central role in sensing intracellular pH changes to regulate focal adhesion stability and cell migration rate . 5 . 4 Discussion Increased pH i was previously assumed to promote focal adhesion remodeling . [ 245 , 316 ] The focal adhesion protein talin senses variations in the intracellular pH within the physiological range and regulates the stability of focal adhesions by altered aﬃnity for the cytoskeletal protein actin . A structural model for pH dependent actin binding by monomeric USH - I / LWEQ talin suggests that protonation of His - 2418 , which has 94 5 . 4 Discussion an upshifted pK a value , modulates conformation and dynamics at the remote actin binding site . Signal transduction from the pH sensor at one end of the ﬁve helical bundle to the distal actin binding site at the other end might occur via a long range network of amino acids connected by hydrogen bonds . In addition , the C - terminus of talin seems to be the essential determinant in focal adhesion remodeling , since im - paired force generation in talin null cells is restored by expression of full length talin but not by a truncated talin lacking the C - terminus but retaining the FERM domain [ 329 ] which also has an actin binding site although this binding is pH insensitive . In con - trast , a mutant talin lacking the FERM domain but retaining the C - terminus targets to focal adhesions . [ 330 ] Although the FERM domain binds the cytoplasmic tail of β integrins , [ 281 ] the C - terminus of talin1 contains a second integrin binding site . [ 242 ] Fur - thermore , this pH dependent focal adhesion remodeling could be initiated by diﬀerent migratory cues , since integrin activation , [ 307 , 331 ] growth factors , [ 328 , 332 ] and monolayer wounding [ 328 ] stimulate NHE1 activity and increase pH i . Therefore , pH regulated focal adhesion stability based on dynamic changes in talin aﬃnity for F - actin may be one of several complementary mechanisms controlling focal adhesion turnover . Changes in intracellular pH regulate a number of normal and pathological cell pro - cesses . Increases in pH i are permissive for growth factor induced cell proliferation , [ 311 ] cell cycle progression , [ 333 ] and diﬀerentiation [ 334 ] and are necessary for cell migration . [ 335 ] On the contrary , increased cytosolic pH is a hallmark of transformed cells from diﬀerent tissue origins and genetic backgrounds , making it a common characteristic of distinct cancers and possibly a common critical driving force for tumor progression . [ 336 ] Because cytosolic pH homeostasis is tightly regulated , [ 337 ] dramatic diﬀerences in cell behavior are driven by relatively small changes in pH i . The increased pH i in transformed cells diﬀers only by 0 . 3 – 0 . 5 pH units as compared to normal cells that generally main - tain their pH i at ∼ 7 . 2 and variations of 0 . 3 – 0 . 4 pH units below the normal value already trigger apoptosis . Despite established eﬀects of small changes in pH i on diverse cell functions , the underlying mechanisms by which these changes aﬀect proteins and macromolecular assemblies driving speciﬁc cell processes remains relatively unknown . One advantage of protons to serve for signaling and regulation as opposed to post - translational modiﬁcations or cofactors is the potential for extremely rapid temporal responses . Furthermore , another intriguing aspect of pH sensitivity is the ability to reg - ulate multiple proteins in unison . Increased pH i is an evolutionarily conserved signal necessary for several stages of cell migration in addition to focal adhesion remodeling , including polarity [ 245 , 246 ] and the assembly of cytoskeletal ﬁlaments . [ 246 , 338 ] Moreover , besides talin a number of proteins bind actin in a pH dependent manner , including HIP1 , [ 339 ] coﬁlin , [ 310 ] and villin . [ 340 ] However , increased pH i also plays a decisive role in most metastatic cancers , regardless of the tissue origin or genetic background . [ 247 ] Several studies have highlighted that intracellular alkalinization is an essential determi - nant in tumor transformation , development , cell growth , and in the maintenance of the metastatic process . [ 336 , 341 , 342 ] Oncogenes are able to induce the necessary and permis - sive cytosolic alkalinization that precedes cell transformation . [ 307 , 336 ] In transformed and cancer cells the NHE1 is usually hyperactive , aﬀecting the behavior of the cells 95 Chapter 5 pH Dependent Talin Binding to Actin Promotes FA Remodeling in this respect that the cells persistently maintain in a status of permanent and un - controlled proliferation . [ 333 , 343 ] Further , NHE1 directly coordinates tumor cell motility and invasion by selectively regulating cytoskeletal events such as focal adhesion assem - bly . [ 336 , 344 ] Hence , the higher pH i of metastatic cells compared with normal cells could increase focal adhesion turnover to promote migratory capacity . Besides , this study underscores the importance of bridging structural and cellular biology to elucidate how physiological changes in pH i regulate cell behaviors . 96 Chapter 6 Summary The present thesis highlights the advantageous feature of solution state NMR spec - troscopy . Whereas for the pure structure determination X - ray crystallography still represents the method of choice , NMR spectroscopy has the unique capacity to in - vestigate dynamic properties of molecules over a range of diﬀerent time scales with atomic resolution . Since most proteins function through transitions from ground states to sparsely populated excited states , which inevitably involves conformational changes , a thorough understanding of protein function is not possible without understanding protein dynamics . These dynamic processes cover a large time regime , including very fast ﬂuctuations of individual atoms on the ps time scale , loop and domain motions on the ns time scale , and conformational rearrangements on the ms time scale . Many critical biological activities occur at the µ s to ms time scale , such as protein folding and allosteric regulation , and manifest as the chemical exchange phenomena in NMR spectroscopy . Folding and unfolding of proteins are crucial in regulating biological activity and targeting proteins to distinct cellular locations . Aggregation of misfolded proteins that escape the cellular quality control mechanisms is a common feature of a wide range of diseases . Since it is assumed that the shape of the folding landscape and hence the tendency to fold or misfold is encoded in the intrinsic properties of the amino acid sequence , investigation of highly homologous members of the same protein family but with remarkably diﬀerent success rates in reaching the native state within a reasonable amount of time might reveal hints on the determinants of proper folding or harmful misfolding . Furthermore , it is generally accepted that potentially all proteins fold via an intermediate state that acts as a stepping stone to the native state . Therefore , these intermediate states play a key role in deﬁning protein folding and assembly pathways as well as those of misfolding and aggregation . Yet , due to their transient nature , folding intermediates are poorly accessible to high resolution techniques . Chapter 3 describes 97 Chapter 6 Summary the intrinsically slow folding reaction of the constant antibody domain of the light chain ( C L ) by real time NMR spectroscopy and speciﬁes its major folding intermediate in detail . Moreover , a single point mutation enabled trapping of the intermediate in equilibrium and hence its characterization at atomic resolution based on a compre - hensive analysis of chemical shifts , dihedral angle restraints , and NOESY cross peaks for the native state and the intermediate state of the C L domain in conjunction with a simulated annealing like protocol . The NMR experiments in combination with the simulations provide a detailed picture of the major C L folding intermediate . Thus , the intermediate state of the C L domain exhibits the basic β - barrel topology typical for the immunoglobulin fold , however some ﬂexible regions adopt a variety of confor - mations that especially holds for the ﬂanking edge strands at one side of the protein . Surprisingly , two short strand connecting helices assume their completely native struc - ture already in the intermediate state and therefore might fulﬁll a spacer and orienting function for adjacent strands and loops . Hence , these two helices can be regarded as a scaﬀold within the C L intermediate favoring the formation of a native like topology by correctly positioning important parts of the molecule . This assumption was further veriﬁed by comparing the major folding intermediate of the C L domain that favors pro - ductive folding with the intermediate state of the well studied β 2 - microglobulin that has the tendency to misfold and form amyloid ﬁbrils . Although C L and β 2 m are highly ho - mologous members of the widespread immunoglobulin superfamily , C L has never been directly associated with amyloidogenic processes , whereas β 2 m is known to cause amy - loid diseases . Transplanting the sequences corresponding to the C L helices , which are conserved in constant antibody domains but lacking in β 2 - microglobulin , into the β 2 m framework signiﬁcantly reduces its amyloidogenicity . This study clearly demonstrates that minor structural diﬀerences in an intermediate can shape the folding landscape decisively to favor either folding or misfolding . Besides productive folding to the native state , the biological functions of proteins also depend on the assembly into the correct quaternary structure . A particularly important example in this respect are IgG antibodies in which two heavy and two light chains have to associate prior to secretion from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . Whereas isolated antibody light chains are in most cases readily secreted , unassembled Ig heavy chains are retained in the ER by interaction with the molecular chaperone BiP until association with the light chain . The ﬁrst constant domain of the heavy chain , the C H 1 domain , plays a crucial role in this retention process . Since the individual domains of an immunoglobulin exhibit highly similar three dimensional structures and generally fold to their native state autonomously , the underlying principles for this special behavior of the C H 1 domain remained enigmatic . In Chapter 4 the structural properties of this antibody domain are analyzed in more detail . Surprisingly , in marked contrast to all isolated antibody domains studied so far , the C H 1 domain is a natively unfolded pro - tein . It gains structure only upon interaction with its native partner , the C L domain . Characterization of the folding pathway of the intrinsically disordered C H 1 domain in complex with the C L domain by real time NMR spectroscopy revealed that this asso - ciation coupled folding reaction proceeds via a partially structured encounter complex . 98 Summary Based on the atomic level description of the folding pathway , key residues that allow speciﬁc recognition of the two proteins and thereby establish a folding nucleus in the C H 1 domain could be identiﬁed . In order to verify the theory that the intrinsically unfolded nature of the C H 1 domain controls the secretion of antibody molecules in a cellular context , the structural characteristics of C H 1 were transplanted into the IgG light chain . In vivo , this altered light chain strongly interacts with the molecular chap - erone BiP and is no longer secreted from the ER . Hence , these structural characteristics of the C H 1 domain and its role in antibody retention are intrinsic , context independent features . These data provide insight into the folding pathway of natively disordered proteins and highlight the plasticity of folding properties within one protein topology to fulﬁll speciﬁc biological requirements . Another essential process in nature to regulate biological activity of proteins involves the coupling of conformational changes between two widely separated binding sites . Al - lostery is crucial to living cells and controls metabolism either through positive feedback regulation or negative inhibition . The propagation of conformational changes over long distances or through a closely packed protein is remarkably subtle and eﬀective . Yet , how these conformational changes are generated and transmitted remains a challenging subject of current research . Chapter 5 deals with the fundamental process of cell mi - gration . At the leading edge of a migrating cell , focal adhesions undergo rapid cycles of assembly and turnover , creating and disrupting , respectively , sites of traction necessary for forward movement of the cell . Force generation for traction requires linkage among the extracellular matrix , integrin receptors , and actin ﬁlaments . Actin ﬁlament bind - ing by the integrin associated focal adhesion protein talin is pH sensitive with lower aﬃnity at higher pH , although the functional signiﬁcance of this pH dependence re - mains unknown . Because increased intracellular pH ( pH i ) promotes cell migration and is a hallmark of metastatic carcinomas , focal adhesion remodeling might be increased through lower aﬃnity talin - actin binding . NMR spectroscopic investigations on the pH sensitive USH - I / LWEQ domain of talin reveals a possible structural mechanism of pH dependent actin binding . A cluster of titratable amino acids with upshifted pK a values , including the solely histidine residue , was identiﬁed at one end of the ﬁve helix bundle distal from the actin binding site . Protonation of the histidine modulates con - formation and dynamics at the remote actin binding site . CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments indicate conformational changes in the actin binding site associated with physiological changes in the intracellular pH . Furthermore , analysis of RDCs at two diﬀerent pH values suggests that signal transduction from the pH sensor to the distal actin binding site might occur via a long range network of amino acids connected by hydrogen bonds . This model of pH regulated focal adhesion turnover in migrating cells based on NMR experiments could be conﬁrmed in vivo . In motile ﬁbroblasts , increas - ing pH i decreases focal adhesion lifetime and increases the migratory rate . These data identify a molecular mechanism for pH sensitive actin binding by talin and suggest that focal adhesion is in part allosterically regulated by pH dependent aﬃnity of talin for actin binding . 99 Appendix A The C L Domain of the Immunoglobulin G Antibody A . 1 Sample Preparation The antibody domain C L was expressed , refolded , and puriﬁed as published . [ 111 , 345 ] The C L gene was obtained by PCR ampliﬁcation using the cDNA of the murine MAK33 κ light chain as a template . The PCR product was cloned into the pET28a expres - sion vector ( Novagen , Darmstadt , Germany ) via the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites and transformed into the E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) . Cells were grown at 37 ◦ C in selective LB medium , and expression was started by addition of 1 mM isopropyl - β - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) at an OD 600 of 0 . 8 . After expression overnight at 37 ◦ C , cells were harvested by centrifugation ( 4000 g ) . The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 mM Tris - HCl , 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 5 at 4 ◦ C . Cells were cracked with a cell disruptor and DNA was removed by the addition of 10 µ g / mL DNAseI , 3 mM MgCl 2 and incubation for 30 min at room temperature . Thereafter , 2 . 5 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 was added and the mixture was stirred for further 30 min at 4 ◦ C . In - clusion bodies were isolated by centrifugation ( 40000 g , 30 min , 4 ◦ C ) and washed two times with 100 mM Tris - HCl , 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 5 . Subsequently , inclusion bodies were solubilized in 100 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 6 M GdmCl , 10 mM β - mercaptoethanol for 2 h at room temperature . Insoluble components were removed by centrifugation ( 40000 g , 25 min , 20 ◦ C ) . The supernatant was applied to a Ni - chelating column equilibrated in 100 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 5 , 3 M GdmCl . After washing for ﬁve column volumes , elution was performed with the same buﬀer at pH 4 . 0 . Refolding was carried out via dialysis in 250 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 100 mM L - Arg , 10 mM EDTA , 1 mM GSSG , 0 . 5 mM GSH at 4 ◦ C overnight . Aggregates were removed by centrifugation ( 40000 g , 25 min , 4 ◦ C ) and 0 . 25 units Thrombin ( re - 101 Appendix A The C L Domain of the Immunoglobulin G Antibody striction grade , Novagen , Darmstadt , Germany ) for each mg protein were added to remove the N - terminal His - tag . The reaction was allowed to proceed for 16 h at 4 ◦ C . After an additional centrifugation step to remove aggregates ( 40000 g , 25 min , 4 ◦ C ) , the concentrated supernatant was applied to a Superdex 75 26 / 60 gel ﬁltration column ( Amersham Biosciences , Upsala , Sweden ) equilibrated in PBS buﬀer . This protocol results in a yield of around 10 mg / mL pure protein . The C P 35 A L mutant was generated by site directed mutagenesis ( Stratagene ) and cloned , expressed , refolded , and puriﬁed according to the protocol for the C L wild type . Isotope labeled proteins were expressed in M9 minimal medium ( 6 g / L Na 2 HPO 4 , 3 g / L KH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 5 g / L NaCl , 1 g / L NH 4 Cl , 2 mL of 1 M MgSO 4 , 2 g / L glucose , 0 . 2 mL of 0 . 5 M CaCl 2 , antibiotics , 1 mg biotin , 0 . 5 mL of 2 mg / mL thiamine hydrochloride , 1 mL of 15 mg / mL FeCl 2 in 1 M HCl , 1 mL of 15 mg / mL ZnCl 2 in slightly acidic H 2 O , pH 7 . 4 ) containing either 15 N ammonium chloride as the only nitrogen source or additionally 13 C glucose as the only carbon source . The β 2 m gene was obtained by PCR ampliﬁcation from human cDNA ( RZPD ) , the gene for β 2 m toCL was synthesized ( GATC Biotech ) . Both proteins were cloned into the pET28a expression vector ( Novagen ) without a His - tag and expressed overnight at 37 ◦ C in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells , and the inclusion bodies were prepared as described above . IBs were solubilized in 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 8 M urea , 50 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 10 mM EDTA and applied to a Q - sepharose column equilibrated in 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 5 M urea , 10 mM EDTA . The protein of interest in each case did not bind to the column , and the ﬂow through was refolded as described for the C L domain . A Superdex 75 26 / 60 column ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated in PBS buﬀer was used as a ﬁnal puriﬁcation step . All plasmids were sequenced and the mass of each protein was conﬁrmed by MALDI - TOF MS . For the NMR analysis the concentration of the distinct proteins in PBS buﬀer with 5 % ( v / v ) D 2 O was 0 . 5 - 1 . 0 mM . All spectra were recorded at 25 ◦ C on Bruker DMX600 , DMX750 , and AVANCE900 spectrometers . Processing of the spectra was performed using the program Topspin 1 . 3 ( Bruker BioSpin ) and analysis of the spectra was car - ried out with the program Sparky ( www . cgl . ucsf . edu / home / sparky ) . The 15 N labeled unfolded C L for the folding studies was obtained via the same protocol as described above except the refolding step and in addition the gel ﬁltration column in the ﬁnal puriﬁcation step was equilibrated in PBS buﬀer containing 2 M GdmCl . This unfolded C L in PBS containing 2 M GdmCl was diluted tenfold by adding ice cold PBS buﬀer without GdmCl to start the folding process and spectra were measured immediately after mixing . The folding reaction was monitored by a series of real time 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectra acquired every 14 minutes at 2 ◦ C . 102 A . 2 Experiments and Assignment of C wtL and C P 35 A L A . 2 Experiments and Assignment of C wtL and C P 35 A L Table A . 1 : Experiments on the wild type C L domain Experiment Nuclei NS Time domain Data matrix NHSQC 1 H × 15 N 4 1024 × 128 1024 × 256 CHSQC 1 H × 13 C 8 1024 × 256 1024 × 512 HNCO 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 8 1024 × 76 × 82 1024 × 128 × 256 HNcaCO 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 16 1024 × 64 × 82 1024 × 128 × 256 HNCA 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 12 1024 × 76 × 92 1024 × 128 × 128 CBCAcoNH 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 8 1024 × 76 × 96 1024 × 128 × 128 HNCACB 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 32 1024 × 64 × 92 1024 × 128 × 128 CCHcosy 1 H × 13 C × 13 C 16 1024 × 72 × 92 1024 × 128 × 128 CCHtocsy 1 H × 13 C × 13 C 16 1024 × 72 × 92 1024 × 128 × 128 CNHnoesy 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 16 1024 × 64 × 96 1024 × 128 × 128 HNHnoesy 1 H × 15 N × 1 H 16 1024 × 64 × 128 1024 × 128 × 256 NNHnoesy 1 H × 15 N × 15 N 16 1024 × 64 × 96 1024 × 128 × 128 MEXICO 1 H × 15 N 8 1024 × 128 1024 × 256 HetNOE 1 H × 15 N 128 1024 × 128 1024 × 256 Table A . 2 : Experiments on the C P 35 A L mutant Experiment Nuclei NS Time domain Data matrix NHSQC 1 H × 15 N 4 1024 × 128 1024 × 256 CHSQC 1 H × 13 C 4 1024 × 256 1024 × 512 HNCO 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 8 1024 × 64 × 64 1024 × 128 × 256 HNcaCO 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 64 1024 × 48 × 64 1024 × 128 × 128 HNCA 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 24 1024 × 56 × 78 1024 × 128 × 128 CBCAcoNH 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 16 1024 × 48 × 64 1024 × 128 × 128 HNCACB 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 32 1024 × 52 × 72 1024 × 128 × 128 CCHcosy 1 H × 13 C × 13 C 16 1024 × 72 × 92 1024 × 128 × 128 CCHtocsy 1 H × 13 C × 13 C 16 1024 × 72 × 92 1024 × 128 × 128 CNHnoesy 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 24 1024 × 64 × 92 1024 × 128 × 128 HNHnoesy 1 H × 15 N × 1 H 16 1024 × 56 × 102 1024 × 128 × 256 NNHnoesy 1 H × 15 N × 15 N 16 1024 × 64 × 82 1024 × 128 × 128 MEXICO 1 H × 15 N 8 1024 × 128 1024 × 256 HetNOE 1 H × 15 N 32 1024 × 128 1024 × 256 103 Appendix A The C L Domain of the Immunoglobulin G Antibody T a b l e A . 3 : B a c k b o n e a nd s i d e c h a i n a ss i g n m e n t s o f t h e w il d t y p e C L d o m a i n R e s i du e H N ( N ) C ’ H α ( C α ) H β ( C β ) H γ ( C γ ) H δ ( C δ ) G 1 − − − − − − S 2 − − − − − − H 3 − 17 4 . 46 4 . 53 ( 55 . 97 2 . 83 , 2 . 90 ( 30 . 94 ) − − M 4 8 . 12 ( 119 . 87 ) 1 74 . 99 4 . 45 ( 56 . 16 ) 1 . 99 ( 35 . 13 ) 2 . 43 , 2 . 59 ( 32 . 33 ) − A 5 9 . 37 ( 125 . 64 ) 1 75 . 23 4 . 61 ( 52 . 09 ) 1 . 32 ( 21 . 77 ) − − A 6 8 . 69 ( 127 . 42 ) 1 74 . 97 4 . 43 ( 49 . 89 ) 1 . 24 ( 17 . 51 ) − − P 7 − − − − − − T 8 − − − − − − V 9 − 17 4 . 71 5 . 14 ( 61 . 19 ) 1 . 56 ( 33 . 51 ) 0 . 58 ( 21 . 56 ) − S 10 8 . 84 ( 121 . 25 ) − 4 . 65 ( 57 . 04 ) 3 . 57 , 3 . 66 ( 66 . 15 ) − − I 11 − − − − − − F 12 − − − − − − P 13 − − − − − − P 14 − − − − − − S 15 8 . 66 ( 121 . 15 ) 17 8 . 92 4 . 65 ( 59 . 65 ) 3 . 92 ( 63 . 32 ) − − S 16 − − − − − − E 17 − 1 78 . 91 3 . 92 ( 59 . 63 ) 1 . 80 , 1 . 91 ( 29 . 05 ) 2 . 15 , 2 . 19 ( 36 . 40 ) − Q 18 7 . 83 ( 121 . 38 ) 17 9 . 13 3 . 82 ( 58 . 70 ) 1 . 87 , 2 . 00 ( 27 . 79 ) 2 . 17 ( 33 . 39 ) − L 19 7 . 89 ( 120 . 81 ) 18 0 . 47 4 . 29 ( 57 . 80 ) 1 . 30 , 1 . 80 ( 41 . 92 ) 1 . 53 ( 26 . 89 ) 0 . 64 ( 23 . 31 ) , 0 . 75 ( 25 . 30 ) T 20 8 . 03 ( 113 . 86 ) 17 5 . 51 3 . 91 ( 65 . 43 ) 4 . 17 ( 69 . 09 ) 1 . 16 ( 21 . 57 ) − S 21 7 . 68 ( 115 . 82 ) 1 74 . 69 4 . 42 ( 59 . 26 ) 3 . 87 , 3 . 96 ( 64 . 19 ) − − G 22 7 . 98 ( 108 . 67 ) 17 4 . 04 3 . 54 , 4 . 32 ( 45 . 74 ) − − − G 23 7 . 87 ( 111 . 30 ) 17 0 . 19 3 . 46 , 4 . 31 ( 44 . 23 ) − − − A 24 7 . 82 ( 119 . 11 ) 17 4 . 30 3 . 82 ( 51 . 33 ) 0 . 42 ( 21 . 41 ) − − S 25 7 . 70 ( 116 . 50 ) 1 72 . 36 4 . 99 ( 57 . 12 ) 3 . 26 , 3 . 39 ( 63 . 67 ) − − V 26 8 . 79 ( 126 . 92 ) 17 4 . 11 4 . 00 ( 60 . 96 ) 1 . 60 ( 32 . 58 ) 0 . 42 ( 20 . 77 ) − V 27 8 . 09 ( 124 . 83 ) 17 4 . 00 5 . 00 ( 61 . 08 ) 1 . 71 ( 35 . 58 ) 0 . 60 ( 21 . 17 ) − C 28 9 . 57 ( 126 . 43 ) 17 3 . 98 5 . 40 ( 53 . 24 ) 2 . 81 , 2 . 85 ( 43 . 70 ) − − F 29 − 17 4 . 37 4 . 77 ( 54 . 38 ) 2 . 42 , 2 . 56 ( 41 . 61 ) − − L 30 8 . 76 ( 119 . 89 ) − 5 . 22 ( 52 . 67 ) − ( 41 . 89 ) − − N 31 − 1 72 . 04 3 . 99 ( 54 . 94 ) 2 . 65 , 2 . 77 ( 37 . 82 ) − − N 32 8 . 79 ( 114 . 08 ) 17 4 . 66 5 . 09 ( 54 . 27 ) 1 . 86 , 2 . 42 ( 42 . 93 ) − − 104 A . 2 Experiments and Assignment of C wtL and C P 35 A L T a b l e A . 3 : c o n t i nu e d .

The PCR product was cloned into the pET28a vector ( Novagen , Gibbstown , NJ , USA ) without any attached tag . The C H 1 domain was expressed as inclusion bodies overnight at 37 ◦ C in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells and selective LB medium . Isotope labeled protein for the NMR experiments was expressed in M9 medium with 15 N ammonium chloride as the only nitrogen source or additionally 13 C as the only carbon source . Inclusion bodies were isolated as published . [ 345 ] After expression overnight at 37 ◦ C , cells were harvested by centrifugation ( 4000 g ) . The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 mM Tris - HCl , 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 5 at 4 ◦ C . Cells were cracked with a cell disruptor and DNA was removed by the addition of 10 µ g / mL DNAseI , 3 mM MgCl 2 and incubation for 30 min at room temperature . Thereafter , 2 . 5 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 was added and the mixture was stirred for further 30 min at 4 ◦ C . Inclusion bodies were isolated by centrifugation ( 40000 g , 30 min , 4 ◦ C ) and washed two times with 100 mM Tris - HCl , 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 5 . Subsequently , inclusion bodies were solubilized in 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 10 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 10 mM EDTA , 8 M urea and insoluble components were removed by centrifugation ( 40000 g ) . The supernatant was applied to a Q - sepharose column equilibrated in the same buﬀer with 5 M urea . Under these conditions , C H 1 did not bind to the column . Refolding was carried out via dialysis in 250 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 2 , 100 mM L - Arg , 10 mM EDTA , 1 mM GSSG , 0 . 5 mM GSH overnight at 4 ◦ C . After refolding and an additional centrifugation step to remove aggregates , the protein was applied to a Superdex 75 26 / 60 gel ﬁltration column ( GE Healthcare , M¨unchen , Germany ) equilibrated in PBS 117 Appendix B The C H 1 Domain of the Immunoglobulin G Antibody buﬀer . This protocol results in a yield of around 5 mg / mL pure protein . The vector with the gene of the C H 1 domain was sequenced and the protein mass was veriﬁed by MALDI - TOF MS . For the NMR analysis the concentration of either the assembled or the unassembled C H 1 domain in PBS buﬀer with 5 % ( v / v ) D 2 O was 0 . 5 - 1 . 0 mM . Spectra of the C H 1 domain in complex with the C L domain were recorded at 25 ◦ C on Bruker DMX600 , and DMX750 spectrometers , whereas spectra of the unfolded C H 1 domain were mea - sured at 12 ◦ C on a Bruker AVANCE900 spectrometer . Processing of all spectra was performed using the program Topspin 1 . 3 ( Bruker BioSpin ) and analysis of the spectra was carried out with the program Sparky ( www . cgl . ucsf . edu / home / sparky ) . In order to ensure complete folding of the C H 1 domain for the spectra of the assembled C H 1 , unlabeled C L was added to labeled C H 1 at a molar ratio of ∼ 2 : 1 and the folding reaction was allowed to proceed for at least 6 h at room temperature . For the RDC measurement , this complex was subsequently partially aligned with non - ionic liquid crystalline media composed of n - alkyl - polyethylene glycol and n - alkyl alcohol . Ac - cording to the paper by Otting and coworkers , [ 223 ] for the given salt concentration , pH value , and temperature range 3 wt % C12E5 / hexanol ( molar ratio r = 0 . 96 ) was chosen as alignment media . In the case of the assembled C H 1 domain , the sample volume of 400 µ L resulted in 12 . 5 µ L C12E5 and 2 . 5 µ L hexanol to obtain a stable alignment . The association coupled folding reaction of the C H 1 domain was followed by real time 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectra recorded every 14 minutes directly after adding unlabeled C L to the labeled C H 1 at 12 . 5 ◦ C due to the reduced reaction rate at lower temperature . 118 B . 2 Experiments and Assignment of the Folded and Unfolded C H 1 Domain B . 2 Experiments and Assignment of the Folded and Unfolded C H 1 Domain Table B . 1 : Experiments on the assembled C H 1 domain Experiment Nuclei NS Time domain Data matrix NHSQC 1 H × 15 N 8 1024 × 128 1024 × 256 HNCO 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 8 1024 × 72 × 60 1024 × 128 × 256 HNcaCO 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 32 1024 × 52 × 72 1024 × 128 × 256 HNCA 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 16 1024 × 64 × 92 1024 × 128 × 256 HNcoCA 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 48 1024 × 52 × 72 1024 × 128 × 256 IPAP - HSQC 1 H × 15 N 128 1024 × 256 1024 × 512 MEXICO 1 H × 15 N 128 1024 × 128 1024 × 256 Table B . 2 : Experiments on the unassembled C H 1 domain Experiment Nuclei NS Time domain Data matrix NHSQC 1 H × 15 N 8 1024 × 256 1024 × 512 HNCO 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 8 1024 × 72 × 96 1024 × 128 × 256 HNcaCO 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 16 1024 × 72 × 96 1024 × 128 × 256 CBCAcoNH 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 24 1024 × 72 × 92 1024 × 128 × 256 HNCACB 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 32 1024 × 70 × 90 1024 × 128 × 256 HNHnoesy 1 H × 15 N × 1 H 16 1024 × 72 × 128 1024 × 128 × 256 NNHnoesy 1 H × 15 N × 15 N 16 1024 × 96 × 96 1024 × 128 × 128 HetNOE 1 H × 15 N 128 1024 × 220 1024 × 512 MEXICO 1 H × 15 N 64 1024 × 128 1024 × 256 119 Appendix B The C H 1 Domain of the Immunoglobulin G Antibody Table B . 3 : Backbone assignments of the assembled C H 1 domain Residue H N ( N ) C’ C α T1 8 . 17 ( 120 . 92 ) 176 . 25 62 . 50 T2 8 . 26 ( 122 . 47 ) 176 . 19 56 . 34 P3 − − − P4 − − 62 . 00 S5 8 . 30 ( 116 . 32 ) 176 . 00 58 . 38 V6 − 176 . 29 63 . 45 Y7 8 . 54 ( 127 . 25 ) 168 . 73 58 . 07 P8 − − 62 . 17 L9 8 . 35 ( 121 . 97 ) 175 . 91 53 . 02 A10 7 . 75 ( 124 . 62 ) 175 . 53 48 . 54 P11 − − 62 . 46 G12 8 . 69 ( 106 . 75 ) 174 . 25 45 . 23 S13 8 . 22 ( 114 . 67 ) 174 . 67 58 . 83 A14 8 . 52 ( 125 . 03 ) 177 . 51 52 . 41 A15 8 . 05 ( 123 . 08 ) 177 . 88 52 . 48 Q16 8 . 36 ( 120 . 00 ) 176 . 24 55 . 74 T17 8 . 07 ( 121 . 75 ) 175 . 57 61 . 97 N18 8 . 34 ( 124 . 89 ) 176 . 07 53 . 89 S19 − 174 . 46 53 . 15 M20 7 . 97 ( 120 . 24 ) 174 . 94 53 . 58 V21 9 . 45 ( 122 . 29 ) 173 . 30 60 . 52 T22 7 . 74 ( 123 . 26 ) 172 . 00 62 . 38 L23 8 . 86 ( 126 . 51 ) 175 . 60 52 . 11 G24 8 . 32 ( 130 . 75 ) 171 . 71 46 . 81 C25 9 . 08 ( 117 . 66 ) 171 . 76 54 . 63 L26 9 . 09 ( 127 . 44 ) 169 . 77 53 . 91 V27 − 173 . 64 61 . 51 K28 8 . 94 ( 126 . 30 ) 176 . 53 55 . 65 G29 8 . 23 ( 115 . 73 ) 176 . 34 48 . 12 Y30 − 173 . 10 59 . 27 F31 8 . 30 ( 112 . 05 ) 175 . 68 55 . 56 P32 − − 63 . 32 E33 7 . 79 ( 117 . 31 ) 174 . 91 56 . 87 P34 − − 62 . 36 V35 7 . 46 ( 110 . 17 ) 175 . 36 60 . 05 T36 8 . 63 ( 116 . 01 ) 173 . 56 60 . 69 V37 8 . 69 ( 125 . 57 ) 175 . 66 60 . 82 T38 8 . 80 ( 118 . 48 ) 171 . 08 59 . 56 W39 9 . 07 ( 118 . 99 ) 177 . 78 55 . 63 N40 − 176 . 77 53 . 96 S41 9 . 52 ( 110 . 91 ) 174 . 27 58 . 95 G42 7 . 75 ( 106 . 04 ) 174 . 97 43 . 98 S43 7 . 93 ( 115 . 70 ) 174 . 43 60 . 58 L44 − 175 . 93 52 . 47 S45 8 . 17 ( 122 . 36 ) 173 . 18 55 . 87 S46 7 . 20 ( 117 . 03 ) 176 . 04 53 . 17 G47 8 . 01 ( 111 . 98 ) 173 . 75 46 . 09 120 B . 2 Experiments and Assignment of the Folded and Unfolded C H 1 Domain Table B . 3 : continued .

The PCR product was cloned into the pGEX6P2 expression vector ( GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) via the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites resulting in a GST fusion protein and transformed into the E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) . Cells were grown at 37 ◦ C in selective LB medium till an OD 600 of 0 . 5 and subsequently adapted to a temperature of 30 ◦ C for approximately half an hour . When the OD 600 reached 0 . 8 the expression was started by addition of 0 . 5 mM isopropyl - β - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . After expression for 6 h at 30 ◦ C , cells were harvested by centrifugation ( 4000 g ) . The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS buﬀer ( 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 140 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , pH 7 . 2 ) . Dis - ruption of the cells was carried out by high - pressure treatment and DNA was removed by the addition of 10 µ g / mL DNAseI , 3 mM MgCl 2 and incubation for 30 min at room temperature . Thereafter , 1 % Triton X - 100 was added and the mixture was incubated for further 60 min at 4 ◦ C . Finally , removal of the insoluble components was achieved by centrifugation ( 40000 g ) . For the batch puriﬁcation , 5 mL glutathione sepharose per L cell culture was washed three times with PBS buﬀer and subsequently added to the supernatant . After incubation for 2 h under slight shaking at room temperature and washing three times with protease buﬀer ( 44 mM K 2 HPO 4 , 5 . 8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , pH 8 . 0 ) , the glutathione sepharose beads were resuspended in 8 mL / L protease buﬀer and 50 µ L / L prescission protease ( GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) were added to remove the N - terminal GST - tag . The cleavage was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 ◦ C . After an additional centrifugation step to spin down 127 Appendix C The pH Sensitive USH - I / LWEQ Domain of Talin the sepharose beads ( 500 g , 5 min , 4 ◦ C ) , the concentrated supernatant contained the cleaved talin construct . This protocol results in a yield of around 20 mg / mL pure pro - tein . Isotope labeled protein was expressed in M9 minimal medium that additionally included 1 g / L Isogro ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) and 10 mL / L 100x MEM vitamins ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) containing either 15 N ammonium chloride as the only nitrogen source or additionally 13 C glucose as the only carbon source . The plasmid was sequenced and the protein mass was conﬁrmed by MALDI - TOF MS . For the NMR analysis the concentration of the USH - I / LWEQ domain of talin in the phosphate buﬀer ( 44 mM K 2 HPO 4 , 5 . 8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT ) with 5 % ( v / v ) D 2 O at either pH 6 . 5 or pH 7 . 5 was around 1 . 0 mM . Spectra of this talin construct were recorded at 32 ◦ C on Bruker DRX500 , DMX750 , and AVANCE800 spectrometers . Processing of all spectra was performed using the program Topspin 1 . 3 ( Bruker BioSpin ) and analysis of the spectra was carried out with the program Sparky ( www . cgl . ucsf . edu / home / sparky ) . For the RDC measurement , the protein was par - tially aligned with non - ionic liquid crystalline media composed of n - alkyl - polyethylene glycol and n - alkyl alcohol . According to the paper by Otting and coworkers , [ 223 ] for the given salt concentration , pH value , and temperature range 3 wt % C12E5 / hexanol ( molar ratio r = 0 . 96 ) was chosen as alignment media . In the case of the talin construct , the sample volume of 400 µ L resulted in 12 . 5 µ L C12E5 and 2 . 5 µ L hexanol to obtain a stable alignment . 128 C . 2 Experiments and Assignment of the Talin USH - I / LWEQ Domain C . 2 Experiments and Assignment of the Talin USH - I / LWEQ Domain Table C . 1 : Experiments on the talin USH - I / LWEQ domain Experiment Nuclei NS Time domain Data matrix NHSQC 1 H × 15 N 8 1024 × 256 1024 × 512 HNCO 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 8 1024 × 64 × 128 1024 × 128 × 256 HNcaCO 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 16 1024 × 64 × 128 1024 × 128 × 256 CBCAcoNH 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 24 1024 × 64 × 96 1024 × 128 × 256 HNCACB 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 24 1024 × 64 × 90 1024 × 128 × 256 HNHnoesy 1 H × 15 N × 1 H 8 1024 × 128 × 256 1024 × 256 × 512 NNHnoesy 1 H × 15 N × 15 N 16 1024 × 112 × 112 1024 × 256 × 256 IPAP - HNCO 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 16 1024 × 128 × 92 1024 × 256 × 256 IPAP - HNCO 1 H × 15 N × 13 C 16 1024 × 64 × 192 1024 × 256 × 256 CPMG 1 H × 15 N 16 1024 × 256 1024 × 512 MEXICO 1 H × 15 N 8 1024 × 300 1024 × 512 129 Appendix C The pH Sensitive USH - I / LWEQ Domain of Talin Table C . 2 : Backbone assignments of the talin USH - I / LWEQ domain Residue H N ( N ) C’ C α C β D1 8 . 28 ( 123 . 71 ) 177 . 81 53 . 06 41 . 41 P2 − 180 . 56 64 . 60 32 . 21 T3 8 . 36 ( 112 . 53 ) 178 . 87 64 . 65 68 . 43 V4 7 . 47 ( 122 . 50 ) 180 . 30 64 . 52 32 . 14 I5 7 . 73 ( 119 . 21 ) 180 . 32 63 . 16 37 . 65 A6 − − − − E7 − 179 . 38 57 . 35 29 . 79 N8 8 . 36 ( 118 . 30 ) 178 . 43 53 . 60 38 . 46 E9 − − − − L10 − − − − L11 − − 55 . 70 41 . 99 G12 8 . 28 ( 109 . 09 ) 179 . 62 46 . 81 − A13 8 . 02 ( 126 . 49 ) 181 . 62 54 . 83 17 . 12 A14 8 . 04 ( 119 . 70 ) 182 . 28 55 . 47 17 . 54 A15 8 . 16 ( 120 . 57 ) 183 . 38 55 . 05 17 . 54 A16 8 . 02 ( 123 . 04 ) − 55 . 21 17 . 73 I17 − − − − E18 − − − − A19 − 183 . 22 54 . 88 17 . 68 A20 7 . 74 ( 122 . 79 ) 182 . 63 54 . 92 17 . 56 A21 8 . 52 ( 120 . 27 ) 183 . 36 54 . 89 17 . 95 K22 8 . 06 ( 118 . 80 ) 181 . 98 58 . 78 31 . 89 K23 7 . 52 ( 118 . 54 ) 181 . 97 59 . 03 31 . 93 L24 7 . 59 ( 117 . 36 ) 181 . 44 56 . 61 41 . 66 E25 7 . 69 ( 117 . 25 ) 179 . 72 58 . 03 29 . 59 Q26 7 . 52 ( 114 . 98 ) 178 . 79 55 . 67 28 . 98 L27 7 . 35 ( 120 . 25 ) 178 . 84 55 . 22 42 . 40 K28 − − − − P29 − 179 . 12 62 . 74 32 . 11 R30 8 . 57 ( 121 . 80 ) 178 . 68 56 . 01 30 . 91 A31 8 . 37 ( 125 . 61 ) − 52 . 30 19 . 05 K32 − − − − P33 − 179 . 59 63 . 08 32 . 03 K34 8 . 46 ( 121 . 32 ) 179 . 53 57 . 03 32 . 52 E35 8 . 49 ( 120 . 71 ) 179 . 05 56 . 32 29 . 73 A36 8 . 26 ( 123 . 67 ) 180 . 05 52 . 83 18 . 91 D37 8 . 18 ( 118 . 52 ) 179 . 15 54 . 23 40 . 83 E38 − 179 . 56 57 . 17 29 . 83 S39 8 . 34 ( 116 . 69 ) 177 . 23 59 . 28 63 . 45 L40 8 . 01 ( 122 . 83 ) 180 . 04 55 . 21 42 . 03 N41 − − − − F42 − 179 . 39 60 . 87 38 . 94 E43 8 . 84 ( 119 . 35 ) 181 . 01 61 . 12 28 . 41 E44 8 . 22 ( 118 . 05 ) 181 . 67 59 . 72 29 . 22 Q45 − 178 . 28 55 . 59 29 . 41 I46 8 . 13 ( 122 . 09 ) 178 . 34 60 . 94 38 . 65 L47 − 181 . 28 58 . 24 41 . 17 130 C . 2 Experiments and Assignment of the Talin USH - I / LWEQ Domain Table C . 2 : continued .
