Shoji Yamada Odontoblasts induced from mesenchymal cells of murine dental papillae in three - dimensional cell culture Received : 13 June 2003 / Accepted : 3 March 2004 / Published online : 22 June 2004 # Springer - Verlag 2004 Abstract In an organ culture system under a three - dimensional microenvironment that provides the condi - tions needed for odontoblast differentiation , a row of odontoblasts can be induced ( Kikuchi et al . 1996 , 2001 ) . Therefore , in a newly designed three - dimensional cell culture system that fulfils the conditions necessary for odontoblast differentiation ( Kikuchi et al . 2002 ) , we examined whether dental papilla cells in rat mandibular incisors could differentiate into tubular dentine - forming cells . In our previously established organ culture system , CM - Dil - labeled cells that were microinjected into isolated dental papillae were replaced by a row of odontoblasts . In a three - dimensional cell culture system , which consists of two kinds of type I collagen in the upper layer over multi - layered cells seeded onto collagen containing Matrigel in the lower layer and which acts as a structural meshwork , dental papilla cells were incubated as multi - layered cells in an artificial extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . The cells aggregated to form a cell mass and invaginated as a cell mass into the ECM . The cells also extended fine fibrillar processes into the ECM . With regard to invagination , the proteolytic activities of matrix metalloproteinase - 2 ( MMP - 2 ) / membrane type 1 - matrix metalloproteinase ( MT 1 - MMP ) were observed on the outer multi - layers of cells within a cell mass adjacent to the ECM . The cell mass progressively shrank to about one - half to one - third of its original diameter and was organized as a tissue surrounded by a newly secreted ECM , like dental pulp - dentine . The cells adjacent to the secreted ECM were constructed as a row of polarized columnar cells . They extended slender processes into the new ECM , which is characteristic of tubular matrix . Dentine sialophosphoprotein ( DSPP ) and dentine matrix protein 1 ( DMP 1 ) genes , which are specific for odontoblast differentiation , were expressed in an aggregated cell mass where tubular matrix - forming cells were induced . Furthermore , the tubular matrix became mineralized under prolonged culture . These results imply that the putative progenitor cells / stem cells residing in dental papillae can differentiate into odontoblasts under appropriate conditions in vitro .

Rat ( Wistar ) Introduction Dentine repair , so - called tertiary dentinogenesis ( second - ary generation of odontoblast differentiation ) , including both reparative and reactionary dentinogenesis , occurs in the ectomesenchymal dental pulp , which is derived from the cranial neural crest , in the absence of epithelial elements and basement membrane ( BM ) . In contrast , primary dentinogenesis ( primary generation of odontoblast differentiation ) is controlled by epithelial - mesenchymal interactions that are mediated by a sheet - like form of specialized extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , BM . In dentine repair processes under physiological condi - tions , tubular dentine - forming cells are induced following the early deposition of either amorphous osteodentine ( reparative dentinogenesis ) or tubular dentine ( reactionary dentinogenesis ) ( Lesot et al . 1994 ) . Under experimental conditions , dentinogenesis can be induced by members of the transforming growth factor - β ( TGF - β ) superfamily combined with certain growth factors ( Ruch et al . 1995 ) , and is induced adjacent to the structural surface of an ECM - absorbed agar substratum ( Kikuchi et al . 1996 , 2001 ) . It can also be induced adjacent to artificial ECM or hydroxyapatite / tricalcium phosphate in grafts ( Tziafas et al . 1995 ; Gronthos et al . 2000 , 2002 ) . Thus , dental pulp / papilla appears to preserve the potential for dentinogen - esis . Therefore , putative progenitor cells / stem cells for regenerative odontoblasts should exist in dental pulp / papilla as a connective tissue . This tissue is composed of H . Kikuchi ( * ) . K .

Since vascular endothelial cells ( Bahary and Zon 2001 ) , mural cells ( pericytes and smooth muscle cells ; Yamashita et al . 2000 ) and peripheral nerve cells ( Tsiper and Yurchenco 2002 ) are adjacent to various types of BM , they may transdifferentiate ( Stahl and Felsen 2001 ; Tsonis 2002 ) . In addition , a predetermined odonto - blastic population of cells exists in the cell - rich zone in dental pulp ( Veis et al . 1984 ) . A layer of odontoblast - lineage cells also exists in the periphery of dental papilla in murine incisors ( Ruch et al . 1995 ; Kikuchi et al . 1996 ) . Moreover , pulpal immunocompetent cells may contribute to tertiary dentinogenesis in the re - planted molar ( Shimizu et al . 2000 ) . A population of stem cells capable of inducing odontoblasts has also been isolated in human dental pulp ( Gronthos et al . 2002 ) . Thus , putative progenitor cells / stem cells for odontoblasts have been reported . Stem cells have also been recognized in other organs , including brain , heart , bone marrow and muscle ( Bianco and Robey 2001 ; Orlic et al . 2001 ; LaBarge and Blau 2002 ; Beltrami et al . 2003 ) . With regard to dentino - genesis , however , there is no direct evidence of the origin of multi - potent adult progenitor cells / stem cells for regenerative odontoblasts . As progenitor cells / stem cells for odontoblasts , there should be some populations of cells in dental pulp / papilla , such as a layer of odontoblast - lineage cells , neighboring subsurface cells beneath the layer , or dental pulp / papilla parenchymal cells . All of these could contain undiffer - entiated and de - or re - differentiated mesenchymal cells ( Yamamura 1985 ) . Furthermore , cells that express both dentine sialoprotein ( DSP ) and phosphophoryn ( DPP ) genes , which are specific markers for odontoblast differ - entiation , have been induced by overexpression of the dentine matrix protein 1 ( DMP 1 ) gene ( Narayanan et al . 2001 ) , which has also been detected in dentine , bone and their respective source cells ( D ’ Souza et al . 1997 ) . Based on these reports , the existence of cells that can be induced to express specific markers and that can induce odonto - blasts adjacent to hydroxyapatite / tricalcium phosphate might partially reflect the fact that when dental pulp cells are adjacent to the surface of mineralized tissues , regenerative odontoblasts are induced ( Lesot et al . 1994 ) . In addition to these cells , it is unclear whether endothelial , mural or peripheral nerve cells adjacent to various types of BM have the potential to transdifferentiate , although it is possible that they may do so only under appropriate conditions . However , the type of cells from which regenerative odontoblasts are derived is poorly under - stood . Furthermore , the signals and pathways by which subodontoblastic cells differentiate into odontoblasts , including the TGF - β superfamily , fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) and insulin - like growth factors ( IGFs ) , are also controversial . In an organ culture system under a three - dimensional microenvironment that provides the conditions needed for odontoblast differentiation , it has been postulated that the BM components and TGF - β 1 that are secreted , together with an ECM - absorbed agar substratum surrounding isolated dental papilla , play roles similar to those possibly played by BM in vivo ( Kikuchi et al . 2001 ) . Moreover , the use of this system makes it possible to examine whether putative progenitor cells / stem cells in cells that are microinjected into dental papillae can migrate and differentiate into odontoblasts . With regard to cell migration and ECM degradation , it has been suggested that proteolytic ECM remodeling not only removes ECM , but also provides a promigratory microenvironment ( Koshikawa et al . 2000 ; Galvez et al . 2002 ) . In such a process , matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) / membrane type - matrix metalloproteinases ( MT - MMPs ) are involved ( Birkedal - Hansen 1995 ; Nagase and Woessner 1999 ) . Furthermore , it has been suggested that the activity , function and morphology of cells under a three - dimen - sional microenvironment , including in vivo , are different from those in two dimensions ( Cukierman et al . 2001 ; Hotary et al . 2003 ) . Since these reports have emphasized that a three - dimensional microenvironment is needed in an in vitro culture system to provide conditions similar to those in vivo , several successful studies of tissue engineering , such as tooth formation , have been reported in in vivo culture systems in which grafts of dental tissues or cells are returned to a three - dimensional microenviron - ment , such as in transplants ( Tucker et al . 1998 ; Young et al . 2002 ; Braut et al . 2003 ; Koyama et al . 2003 ) . Therefore , as an in vitro model of cell culture to examine the origin of multi - potent adult progenitor cells / stem cells for regenerative odontoblasts , in a newly designed three - dimensional cell culture system ( Kikuchi et al . 2002 ) we considered the possibility that the putative progenitor cells / stem cells in dental papillae may be able to differentiate into odontoblasts . In this system , odontoblast differentiation is distinguishable based on whether tubular matrix - or dentine - forming cells are induced . We first elucidated the potential of dental papilla cells to differentiate into odontoblasts in our established organ culture system . The existence of progenitor cells / stem cells for regenerative odontoblasts is distinguishable based on whether CM - DiI - labeled and microinjected cells can be replaced by a row of odontoblasts in dental papillae . Subsequently , in a three - dimensional cell culture system that fulfils the conditions necessary for odontoblast differentiation , we examined whether putative progenitor cells / stem cells in dental papillae were able to differentiate into tubular dentine - forming cells . Materials and methods Preparation of incisor dental papillae Male Wistar rats weighing about 80 g were used . The odontogenic organs ( so - called incisor tooth germs ; Kikuchi et al . 1996 ) were removed by incisally crosscutting the lower incisors . A three - step digestion process was then used to isolate dental papillae and enamel organs from the odontogenic organs ( Kikuchi et al . 1996 ) . An isolated dental papilla was divided into three regions . In region A , a layer of serially differentiating preodontoblasts was located on the 174 agar surface at the apical growing end ; in region B , phenotypic odontoblasts were located on the initially formed predentine ; and in region C , pulpal cells were located on the agar surface at incisally crosscut pulp ( Fig . 1a ) ( Kikuchi et al . 1996 ) . The ethical considerations for experimental animals were approved by The Committee of Animal Experiments at Showa University ( Accep - tance No . 12053 ) . Microinjection and organ culture The isolated dental papillae were digested with 0 . 0125 % trypsin ( 1 : 250 ; Difco Laboratories , Detroit , MI , USA ) – 0 . 01 % collagenase ( type I , 336 U / mg ; Worthington Biochemical Co . , Lakewood , NJ , USA ) in calcium - and magnesium - free phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . The dispersed cells were incubated in Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM ; Nissui Pharmaceutical Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) , supplemented with 15 % fetal calf serum ( Gibco / BRL ; Life Technologies Ltd . , Auckland , New Zealand ) and 180 µg / ml L - ascorbic acid ( Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd . , Osaka , Japan ) , in the presence of 100 µg / ml chondroitin sulfate ( CS ; grade II ; Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO , USA ) and 100 µg / ml hyaluronic acid ( HA ; grade IV ; Sigma ) . After reaching confluence , cells were labeled for 6 h with 0 . 0025 % Cell Tracker CM - DiI ( Molecular Probes Inc . , Leiden , Netherlands ) in dimethyl sulfoxide / DMEM . After dissociation , 1 . 0 µl of the labeled cells was microinjected into the central part of isolated rat dental papillae with a microcapillary at 1×10 8 cells / ml ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Untreated dental papillae were used as controls . They were pre - coated with 2 . 0 mg / ml bovine type I collagen ( Koken Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) mixed with 1 . 0 mg / ml mouse EHS laminin ( Harbor Bio - products , Norwood , MA , USA ) . They were then coated with a 1 . 5 % agar ( Wako ) solution ( Kikuchi et al . 2001 ) . The agar blocks were incubated for 8 days in the same DMEM as described above . After incubation , on deparaffinized sections , CM - DiI - labeled cells that migrated from the central part of isolated dental papillae to each region were detected with a fluorescence microscope equipped with an epifluorescence illumination source ( excitation filter at 560 nm ; emission filter at 590 nm ) specific for rhodamine . Three - dimensional cell culture Cells were enzymatically dissociated from isolated dental papillae and incubated for 7 days in the same DMEM as described above . After dissociation , 50 µl of dispersed cells was seeded at 1×10 8 cells / ml on a Nuclepore filter ( 0 . 6 – 3 . 0 µm pore size ; Nuclepore Co . , Pleasanton , CA , USA ) , which was attached to a Teflon diffusion chamber ( inner - outer diameter of 4 . 5 – 7 . 0 mm and 1 . 5 mm thick ) . It was double - coated with ECMs and then with 500 µg / ml bovine plasma fibronectin ( Koken ) containing 500 µg / ml CS and 500 µg / ml HA ( Fig . 2a ) . The ECMs consisted of either 2 . 0 mg / ml bovine type I collagen alone , 12 . 0 mg / ml mouse EHS Matrigel alone ( Becton Dickinson Labware , Bedford , MA , USA ) , 2 . 0 mg / ml bovine type I collagen – 1 . 0 mg / ml mouse EHS laminin ( 2 : 1 ) , 2 . 0 mg / ml bovine type I collagen – 3 . 0 mg / ml mouse EHS Matrigel ( 2 : 3 ) , or 2 . 0 mg / ml bovine type I collagen – 6 . 0 mg / ml mouse EHS Matrigel – 0 . 3 mg / ml bovine type III collagen ( Koken ) Fig . 1a – i Distribution of CM - DiI - labeled cells that were micro - injected into isolated dental papillae . a Schema showing each region in the apical growing end of an isolated dental papilla in a rat lower incisor ( D dentine , DP dental papilla , dO differentiating odonto - blasts , PD predentine , A region A , B region B , C region C ) . b Sagittal section of dental papilla ( DP ) that was microinjected after incubation for 8 days . CM - DiI - labeled cells were replaced by a row of odontoblasts in regions A , B , and C in the dental papilla .

Scale bars 200 µm ( b ) , 50 µm ( c , d , i ) , 25 µm ( e – h ) 175 ( 2 : 6 : 0 . 3 ) . Cells that were seeded onto the coated filter were then again cover - coated with 1 . 0 mg / ml bovine type I collagen . They were incubated for 0 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 and 60 days in DMEM / Stanners ’ modified Eagle ’ s minimum essential medium ( α - MEM ; ICN Biomedicals Inc . , Aurora , OH , USA ) ( 3 : 1 ) , supplemented with 20 % fetal calf serum , 295 µg / ml L - ascorbic acid - 2 - phosphate ( Wako ) , and 10 − 8 M dexamethasone ( Sigma ) , in the presence of both 100 µg / ml CS and 100 µg / ml HA . Tissue and cell preparations Isolated dental papillae free of dentine or cells seeded on an ECM - coated filter were washed with PBS three times every 30 min and placed overnight at 4°C in a fixative composed of 96 % ethanol containing 1 . 0 % glacial acetic acid . Explants were analyzed with a soft X - ray apparatus ( 38 kV , 4 . 0 mA , 20 s ; Sofron , type SRO - M 50 ; Tanaka X - ray MFG Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) and , when mineralized , placed overnight at 4°C in a fixative composed of a periodate ( Wako ) – lysine ( Wako ) – 2 . 0 % paraformaldehyde ( Merck KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) solution ( pH 6 . 4 ) . They were demineralized for 1 week at 4°C with buffered 10 % EDTA ( Wako ; pH 7 . 3 ) . After being embedded in paraffin , 5 . 0 µm - thick sections were prepared and treated with a haematoxyline and eosin stain , or an immuno - fluorescent stain . Back - scattered electron scanning microscopy Explants that were placed in a fixative were processed to give ground sections of Rigolac , a polyester resin . After being coated with carbon , the sections were imaged with a digital scanning electron microscope ( S2500CX ; Hitachi Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) operated at 20 – 25 kV ( accelerated voltage ) , 0 . 7 µA ( beam current ) , in the back - scattered electron mode using a solid - state back - scattered electron detector ( S5316 , annular type ; Hitachi ) . The weight rations of calcium : phosphorus ( Ca / P ) were obtained by an energy dispersive X - ray microanalysis ( Kevex δ - IV ; Kevex Co . , Foster City , CA , USA ) operated at 15 kV ( accelerated voltage ) , 0 . 1 nA ( beam current ) . Indirect immunofluorescence The deparaffinized sections were pre - treated with 15 , 000 U / ml hyaluronidase ( type V , 2 , 400 U / mg , from sheep testes ; Sigma ) for 20 – 30 min . Next , they were placed in PBS containing 20 mg / ml bovine serum albumin ( BSA ; Fr V ; Bayer Co . , Kankakee , IL , USA ) , 200 µg / ml avidin D ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA , USA ) , and 50 µg / ml immunoglobulins ( Vector ) derived from animal sources of secondary antibodies for 90 min . They were incubated overnight at 4°C with antibodies in a moisture chamber . The antibodies used were 20 µg / ml mouse IgG 3 / κ against human MT 1 - MMP ( F - 84 ; Clone No . 113 – 5B7 , human MT 1 - MMP C 319 DGNFDTVAMLRGEM 333 ; Daiichi Fine Chemicals Co . , Takaoka , Toyama , Japan ) , 20 µg / ml mouse IgG 1 / κ against human MMP - 2 ( F - 68 ; Clone No . 42 – 5D11 , human MMP - 2 V 468 - TPRDKPMGPLLVATF 483 ; Daiichi ) , 4 . 0 µg / ml affinity purified goat polyclonal IgG against mouse DSP ( M - 20 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc . , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , and rabbit antiserum against mouse DSP ( 1 : 250 ; LF - 153 , antiserum that recognized parts of the DSP portion of dentine sialophosphoprotein , DSPP , a gift from Dr . L . W . Fisher , NIH / NIDCR ) . This treatment was followed by incubation with 5 . 0 µg / ml biotinylated F ( ab ’ ) 2 fragments of goat or rabbit IgG antibodies against immunoglobulins of primary anti - bodies ( American Qualex International Inc . , San Clemente , CA , USA ) for 80 min . Finally , samples were immersed in 10 µg / ml fluorescein avidin D ( Vector ) for 60 min . Control sections were incubated with either PBS or normal immunoglobulins derived from animal sources of primary antibodies . Zymography and Western blot analysis Explants were extracted on ice for 1 h with a lysis buffer composed of 50 mM TRIS - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 05 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , 1 . 0 % nonidet - P40 , 1 . 0 mM phenylmethyl - sulfonyl fluoride , and 5 . 0 mM N - ethylmaleimide . Then 20 mM EDTA , 5 . 0 mg / ml sodium deoxycholate , 1 . 0 µg / ml aprotinin , 1 . 0 µg / ml pepstatin , 5 . 0 mg / ml benzamidine , 1 . 0 µg / ml leupeptin , 2 . 0 µg / ml antipain , 1 . 0 mM sodium orthovanadate , 100 mM NaF , 6 . 0 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate and 30 mM p - nitrophenylpho - sphate were added to the extract buffer for DSP . All inhibitors were from Sigma . After the protein concentration was adjusted , the supernatants were suspended in Laemmli sample buffer ( ×5 ) composed of 62 mM TRIS - HCl ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 2 . 0 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , and 0 . 05 % bromophenol blue , and then size - fractionated on 10 % Zymogram gel ( Novex ; Invitrogen Life Technologies , Carlsbad , Fig . 2a , b The newly designed three - dimensional cell culture system for dental papilla cells . a This system consists of two kinds of type I collagen in an upper layer ( matrix I ) and mixed ECM in a lower layer ( matrix II ) in a Teflon diffusion chamber ( Teflon ring ) which is attached to a Nuclepore filter . Multi - layered cells ( cells ) seeded onto the lower layer were cover - coated with type I collagen ( matrix I ) as the upper layer . b Progressive aggregation of multi - layered cells seeded on an artificial ECM over 20 days of incubation [ A : Matrigel alone , B : type I collagen - Matrigel ( 2 : 3 ) , C : type I collagen - Matrigel - type III collagen ( 2 : 6 : 0 . 3 ) , 0 before incubation , 5 5 days , 10 10 days , 20 20 days ] . Seeded multi - layered cells became aggregated and progressively shrank to about one - half to one - third of their original diameter . Digital images were taken with a video camera 176 CA , USA ) . After electrophoresis , the gel was washed two times with 50 mM TRIS - HCl buffer ( pH 7 . 6 ) containing 2 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , incubated overnight at 37°C with a developing buffer consisting of 50 mM TRIS - HCl ( pH 7 . 6 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM CaCl 2 , 1 . 0 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 02 % NaN 3 , stained with 0 . 5 % Coomassie blue G - 250 ( Merck ) in 70 % methanol containing 10 % acetic acid for 2 h , and then destained with the dye solvent . In other samples , the supernatants were suspended in a sample buffer ( ×5 ) consisting of 62 mM TRIS - HCl ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 5 . 0 % β - mercaptoethanol , 2 . 0 % SDS , 5 . 0 % sucrose , and 0 . 002 % bromo - phenol blue . They were then boiled , size - fractionated on 7 . 5 % polyacrylamide gel containing SDS , and electrophoretically trans - ferred to an Immobilon PVDF membrane ( Nihon Millipore , Yonezawa , Yamagata , Japan ) . Each whole lysate was blocked overnight with PBS containing 2 . 0 % BSA , 4 . 0 % Block Ace ( Ukijirushi Nyugyo Co . , Sapporo , Hokkaido , Japan ) and 50 µg / ml immunoglobulins ( Vector ) derived from animal sources of second - ary antibodies at 4°C . MT 1 - MMP and DSP were detected with 2 . 0 µg / ml mouse monoclonal antibodies IgG 3 / κ against human MT 1 - MMP ( Daiichi ) , 0 . 4 µg / ml goat polyclonal IgG antibodies against mouse DSP ( M - 20 ; Santa Cruz ) , or rabbit antiserum against mouse DSP ( 1 : 2 . 000 ; LF - 153 ) for 2 h , 0 . 25 µg / ml biotinylated F ( ab ’ ) 2 fragments of goat or rabbit IgG antibodies against immunoglobulins of primary antibodies ( Qualex ) , and then 0 . 2 µg / ml streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( Vector ) . Visualization was performed using an ECL kit ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UK Ltd . , Bucks . , UK ) . RNA preparation and reverse transcriptase - PCR analysis In explants before and after 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 20 and 40 days of incubation , total RNA was prepared using an RNeasy Mini kit ( Qiagen GmbH , Hilden , Germany ) . cDNAs were prepared with a first - strand cDNA synthesis kit ( Gibco / BRL ) using an oligo - dT primer according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Two micrograms of total RNA obtained from the individual samples incubated in different systems ( Matrigel alone , n = 8 ; type I collagen - Matrigel , n = 3 ; and type I collagen - Matrigel - type III collagen , n = 2 ) was reverse - transcribed separately with Superscript II RT ( Gibco / BRL ) . First - strand cDNA ( 2 µl ) was diluted in 50 µl of reaction mixture consisting of 1 × PCR reaction buffer : 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 / 200 µM each of dNTP / 0 . 5 units of TaKaRa Ex Taq DNA polymerase ( Takara Shuzo Co . , Otsu , Shiga , Japan ) / 10 pM of each specific primer set : DMP 1 ( 673 bp , sense 5 ’ - 148 GAA GAC TGT TAT CCT CCT TAC G - 3 ’ ; antisense 5 ’ - 820 GTG ATC CCC TTT AGA TTC TTC C - 3 ’ ) ( George et al . 1993 ) , DSPP ( 287 bp , sense 5 ’ - 68 CGG TCC CTC AGT TAG TG - 3 ’ ; antisense 5 ’ - 354 TAC GTC CTC GCG TTC T - 3 ’ ) ( Ritchie et al . 1994 ) , and the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ; 626 bp , sense 5 ’ - 165 CCA GTA TGA TTC TAC CCA CGG CAA - 3 ’ ; antisense 5 ’ - 790 ATA CTT GGC AGG TTT CTC CAG GCG - 3 ’ ) . The reaction mixtures were incubated in a thermal cycler at 94°C for 2 min and then for 30 cycles at 94°C / ( 30s ) , 56°C ( DSPP ) / ( 30s ) / 60°C ( DMP 1 and GAPDH ) / ( 30s ) , 72°C / ( 60 – 90s ) , with a final 10 - min extension at 72°C . A negative control was amplified in the absence of templates . After amplification , the PCR products were analyzed by 1 . 5 % agarose gel electrophoresis , and visualized by ethidium bromide staining . Results Construction of CM - Dil - labeled cells into a row of odontoblasts in an organ culture system In primary culture , most of the isolated dental papilla cells were labeled with CM - DiI molecular probes ( data not shown ) . The labeled cells were microinjected into the central part of isolated dental papillae ( Fig . 1a , b ) and Fig . 3a – j Dental papilla cells before and after incubation for 5 – 20 days in a three - dimensional cell culture system . a Before incubation , multi - layered cells ( MLC ) seeded onto a lower layer ( L ) of type I collagen - Matrigel ( C ( I ) + M ) were seen ( U the upper layer ) . b After 5 days , the cells on the lower layer became aggregated to form a cell mass ( CM ) . c , d After 10 days , the cell mass ( CM ) fell to the lower layer of the ECM , and a generative tissue was organized . The cells also extended fine fibrillar processes into the ECM . e – g After 20 days , tubular matrix - forming cells ( ⇈ ) adjacent to a newly secreted ECM ( ▲ ) were seen in the organized tissue . h The cell mass ( CM ) on a lower layer of type I collagen - Matrigel - type III collagen ( C ( I ) + M + C ( III ) ) after 20 days . i The cell mass ( CM ) on a lower layer of Matrigel alone after 20 days . Tubular matrix - forming cells were also seen adjacent to a newly secreted ECM ( ▲ ) . j Multi - layered cells seeded onto a lower layer of type I collagen alone ( C ( I ) ) as a control after 20 days ( NF nuclepore filter ) . All of the cells became scattered and dispersed into both the upper and lower layers . Border ( ⇅ ) between the upper and lower layers . Haematoxyline and eosin stain . Scale bars 400 µm ( a – c , e ) , 200 µm ( h ) , 100 µm ( d , f , i , j ) , 50 µm ( g ) 177 incubated for 8 days . These cells migrated to regions A , B ( Fig . 1a , c , d – f ) and C ( Fig . 1a , g , h ) adjacent to an agar surface in the periphery . In regions A and C , some of the labeled cells accumulated at the subsurface beneath a row of tubular matrix - forming cells and were replaced by a row of cells ( Fig . 1c , e , g ) . In region B , most of the cells were constructed into a row of labeled cells ( Fig . 1c , f ) . Migration also appeared to occur along the periphery of blood vessels from the point of microinjection ( Fig . 1i ) . Similarly , in organ culture of isolated dental papillae with dentine that were incubated with 3 H - thymidine , in region A , some 3 H - thymidine - labeled cells were located on a layer of serially differentiating preodontoblasts . In region C , most 3 H - thymidine - labeled cells were newly con - structed as a row of tubular matrix - forming cells ( Kikuchi et al . 1996 ) . In region B , labeled cells were occasionally replaced by a layer of post - mitotic odontoblasts located on the initially formed predentine ( unpublished data ) . These phenomena imply that the multi - potent adult progenitor cells / stem cells for regenerative odontoblasts are also preserved in cell populations of microinjected dental papilla cells . Construction of a row of tubular matrix - forming cells in a three - dimensional cell culture system After isolated dental papilla cells were incubated in primary culture , the cells were incubated as multi - layered cells seeded on artificial ECM , which was composed of type I collagen - Matrigel ( 2 : 3 ) ( Figs . 2a , b , 3a ) . After 5 days , the cells aggregated to form a cell mass and invaginated as a cell mass into the ECM . Multi - layers of the aggregated cell mass shrank to about two - thirds of their original diameter ( Figs . 2b , 3b ) . The velocity of aggregation on artificial ECM was in the order of Matrigel alone > type I collagen - Matrigel - type III collagen ( 2 : 6 : 0 . 3 ) > type I collagen - Matrigel ( 2 : 3 ) ( Fig . 2b ) . After 10 days , the cell mass was organized as a tissue surrounded by ECM that was newly secreted into the artificial ECM , like dental pulp - dentine . The cells also extended fine fibrillar processes into the artificial ECM . The cell mass reduced in size to about one - half to one - third of its original diameter ( Figs . 2b , 3c , d ) . After 20 days , the cells adjacent to the secreted ECM were constructed as a row of polarized columnar cells . The row of columnar cells with a nucleus extended slender processes into the secreted ECM , characteristic of tubular matrix ( Figs . 2b , 3e – g ) . A row of columnar cells was observed on filters coated with either type I collagen - Matrigel , type I collagen - Matrigel - type III collagen ( Fig . 3h ) or Matrigel alone ( Fig . 3i ) , but not on filters coated with type I collagen alone ( Fig . 3j ) . However , the time lag for such formation may be about 5 days for each condition . Polarized columnar cells were rarely observed on filters coated with type I collagen - EHS laminin ( 2 : 1 ) , but an aggregated cell mass and tissue organization were not observed ( data not shown ) . In invagination processes , immunoreactivities for MT 1 - MMP and MMP - 2 were mainly seen in the outer multi - layers of cells within an aggregated cell mass in Matrigel alone adjacent to the upper layer after 5 days ( Fig . 4a , d , g ) , adjacent to both the upper and lower layers after 10 days ( Fig . 4b , e , h ) , and adjacent to the upper layer after 20 days ( Fig . 4c , f , i ) . The immunoreactivities for both appeared to show similar localization under each condi - tion . A similar expression pattern of MMP 2 and MT 1 - Fig . 4a – i Immunoreactivities of MT 1 - MMP and MMP - 2 in an aggregated cell mass in three - dimensional cell culture . This system is in Matrigel alone . Immunoreactivities ( Δ ) were observed at the interface between the aggregated cell mass ( CM ) and an artificial ECM in both the upper ( U ) and lower ( L ) layers . a – c The upper panel shows the immunoreactivity of MT 1 - MMP for 5 to 20 days . d – f The middle panel shows each immunonegative control ( Δ ; NC ) for 5 to 20 days . g – i The lower panel shows the immunoreactivity of MMP - 2 for 5 to 20 days . These immunoreactivities ( Δ ) were observed in the outer multi - layers of cells within an aggregated cell mass adjacent to the upper layer , the lower layer or both . Border ( ⇅ ) between the upper and lower layers . Scale bar 200 µm 178 MMP was also seen under any condition for each ECM containing Matrigel ( Fig . 5a , b ) . To promote mineralization in the secreted tubular matrix , the cells in organized tissue were incubated for up to 40 to 60 days on either type I collagen - Matrigel ( Fig . 6a , b ) , type I collagen - Matrigel - type III collagen ( Fig . 6c ) or Matrigel alone ( Fig . 6d – f ) . After 40 days , mineralization was promoted under any condition ( Fig . 6g – i ) . These results imply that some populations of cells in dental papillae can differentiate into miner - alized , tubular matrix - forming cells in a three - dimensional microenvironment in vitro . Identification of mineralized tubular matrix - forming cells as odontoblasts The DMP 1 gene was expressed in primary cultures of dental papillae ( Fig . 7a ) . In three - dimensional cell cultures , its expression persisted for 40 days , but decreased slightly at 40 days . The DSPP gene was never expressed in primary cultures ( Fig . 7a ) . In three - dimensional cell cultures , it was expressed after 3 days of incubation , but the expression level progressively decreased until 40 days ( Fig . 7a ) . In the systems consisting of Matrigel alone ( Fig . 7a ) , type I collagen - Matrigel , or type I collagen - Matrigel - type III collagen , a similar expression of these genes was observed , but in the latter two systems there was a slightly lower expression level of the DSPP gene ( data not shown ) . In contrast , tubular matrix - forming cells were observed from 10 to 20 days in all of these systems ( Fig . 3 ) . Cells expressed some genes specific for odonto - blast differentiation soon after beginning incubation ( Fig . 7a ) . In parallel with the expression of the DSPP gene ( Fig . 7 ) , DSPP ( DSP ) was expressed as one of the proteins coded by the DSPP gene under any condition ( Figs . 7b , 8 ) . The cell shape then underwent morpholog - ical changes ( Fig . 3 ) , and this was followed by matrix formation and mineralization ( Figs . 3 , 6 ) . These results imply that tubular matrix - forming cells can be considered as tubular dentine - forming cells . Discussion In an established organ culture system for inducing odontoblast differentiation ( Kikuchi et al . 1996 , 2001 ) , CM - DiI - labeled and microinjected cells were constructed as a row of new tubular matrix - forming cells in dental papillae . Using these primary cultures , tubular dentine - forming cells were induced in a newly designed three - dimensional cell culture system . Labeled dental papilla cells migrate beneath a layer of odontoblasts , although cells capable of replacing this layer are limited . As putative progenitor cells / stem cells , pericytes have been considered to be one of the possible multi - potent cells for regenerative odontoblasts , since 3 H - thymidine - labeled cells are largely localized along the periphery of blood vessels and replaced odontoblasts are labeled ( Yamamura 1985 ; Fitzgerald et al . 1990 ) . In isolated dental papillae with dentine that were incubated with 3 H - thymidine ( Kikuchi et al . 1996 ) , in region C , a Fig . 5a , b MMP - 2 and MT 1 - MMP in an aggregated cell mass in three - dimensional cell culture . ( a ) Gelatine zymograms of MMP - 2 for extracts of the cell mass after 5 and 10 days of incubation . Primary cultures ( lanes 1 and 2 ) ; 5 and 10 days in Matrigel alone ( lanes 3 and 4 ) ; 5 and 10 days in type I collagen - Matrigel ( lanes 5 and 6 ) ; 5 and 10 days in type I collagen - Matrigel - type III collagen ( lanes 7 and 8 ) ; negative control ( sample buffer , lane 9 ) . Three bands ( the pro , intermediate and active forms of MMP - 2 ) were seen between the molecular weight ( MW ) standards of 83 and 51 kilo Daltons ( kD ) , but pro - MMP - 2 ( ∆ ) was not seen in lanes 1 and 2 . Two faint bands ( possibly MMP - 9 ) were seen at about 90 kD ( ▲ ) in lanes 5 to 8 , but not in lanes 1 to 4 . Two unknown bands ( possibly pro - MMP - 9 ) were also seen at about 110 to 120 kD in lanes 5 to 8 ( ▲ ) , but not in lanes 1 to 4 . Unknown bands ( possibly MMP - 1 or MMP - 3 ) were seen at about 40 kD ( ▲ ) only in primary cultures ( lanes 1 and 2 ) . ( b ) Western blots on MT1 - MMP for extracts of the cell mass after 5 and 10 days of incubation . A single band was seen in lanes 1 to 8 between 83 and 51 kD in all systems . Primary cultures ( lanes 1 and 2 ) ; 5 and 10 days in Matrigel alone ( lanes 3 and 4 ) ; 5 and 10 days in type I collagen - Matrigel ( lanes 5 and 6 ) ; 5 and 10 days in type I collagen - Matrigel - type III collagen ( lanes 7 and 8 ) ; negative control ( normal immunoglobulins , lane 9 ) 179 row of odontoblasts is mostly composed of labeled cells . In contrast , CM - DiI - labeled cells accumulate beneath this row , and the row of new cells is only composed of any labeled cells . Similarly , in region A , a layer of serially differentiating cells can be replaced by any labeled cells . In region B , post - mitotic cells are rarely replaced by 3 H - thymidine - labeled cells ( unpublished data ) . In this study , most of the cells were CM - DiI - labeled cells , presumably because of repair due to dentine removal . This might reflect the accumulation of immunocompetent cells into a layer of odontoblasts ( Jontell et al . 1998 ; Shimizu et al . 2000 ) . Stem cells capable of forming dental tissues have been reported in transplants ( Gronthos et al . 2000 , 2002 ; Young et al . 2002 ; Braut et al . 2003 ; Koyama et al . 2003 ) . In cell culture , cells that can express both DSP and DPP genes specific for odontoblast differentiation have also been induced by overexpression of the DMP 1 gene ( Narayanan et al . 2001 ) . This implies that dental pulp / papilla cells that essentially express DMP 1 ( D ’ Souza et al . 1997 ; Feng et al . 2003 ) may have the potential to grow progenitor cells / stem cells , although cells transfected with the DMP 1 gene failed to express typical odontoblasts ( Narayanan et al . 2001 ) . These studies imply that multi - potent cells that can differentiate into odontoblasts exist in the dental pulp / papillae . However , the origin of the cells for regenerative odontoblasts has not yet been identified . Three putative origins of these cells have been proposed . The first possibility is undifferentiated mesenchymal cells , pulpal fibroblasts and cells associated with neuro - vascular supply ( Yamamura 1985 ; Fitzgerald et al . 1990 ) . As one of the candidates , it is possible that pericytes differentiate into smooth muscle cells ( Schor et al . 1995 ) , which readily de - differentiate ( Thyberg and Hultgardh - Nilsson 1994 ) . Endothelial cells also differentiate into smooth muscle cells under the influence of TGF - β 1 ( Arciniegas et al . 1992 ) , or by interacting with nerve cells in embryos ( Mukouyama et al . 2002 ) , since dental pulp / papilla might be analogous to nerve and muscle tissues ( Doetsch et al . 1999 ) . Thus , it is likely that both endothelial and mural cells share a common origin ( Yamashita et al . 2000 ) . In particular , mural cells promote dystrophic calcification ( Boström et al . 1993 ; Schor et al . 1995 ) . Similarly , α - smooth muscle actin - positive cells neighboring mineralized nodules have been the focus of Fig . 6a – i Dental papilla cells after incubation for 40 – 60 days in a three - dimensional cell culture system . a , b Type I collagen - Matrigel ( C ( I ) + M ) . c Type I collagen - Matrigel - type III collagen ( C ( I ) + M + C ( III ) ) . d , e Matrigel alone ( M ) .

Haematoxyline and eosin stain . g – i Back - scattered electron images and soft X - ray images ( inserts ) are shown for each system . Mineralization began at a newly secreted ECM ( ↑ ) adjacent to an aggregated cell mass ( CM ) . The weight ratios of calcium : phosphorus ( Ca / P ) were significant at areas of mineralization in each system ( C ( I ) + M : 2 . 128±0 . 289 ; C ( I ) + M + C ( III ) : 2 . 142±0 . 047 ; M : 2 . 070±0 . 037 ; means ± SD , n = 7 ) . Scale bars 100 µm ( d , f ) , 50 µm ( a ) , 25 µm ( b , c ) , 10 µm ( e , g , h , i ) 180 dental pulp cell cultures ( Alliot - Licht et al . 2001 ) . In this study , it is unclear whether odontoblasts are derived from mural and endothelial cells , although cells that migrate might interact with these cells during migration , based on the presence of CM - DiI - labeled cells along blood vessels . However , blood cells , including circulating adult haema - topoietic stem cells ( Wagers et al . 2002 ) , would not be implicated in odontoblast differentiation , presumably because they are not adherent and are removed in primary culture . Second , it is also possible that a predetermined odontoblastic population of cells at the cell - rich zone in dental pulp ( Veis et al . 1984 ) is a source of cells for replacing damaged odontoblasts . In general , mesenchymal stem cells / multi - potent adult progenitor cells differentiate into tissue - specific cells in response to local organ - specific cues ( Jiang et al . 2002 ; LaBarge and Blau 2002 ) . The third possible origin is a layer of odontoblast - lineage cells ( Ruch et al . 1995 ; Kikuchi et al . 1996 ) . In lineage cells , odontoblasts are induced by the TGF - β superfamily combined with growth factors ( Ruch et al . 1995 ) . Block - age of TGF - β type II receptors reversibly suppresses differentiation . In addition , differentiation requires a three - dimensional microenvironment ( Kikuchi et al . 1996 , 2001 ) . Thus , the origin of the progenitor cells / stem cells and signal pathways for differentiation is controversial . However , multiple signals and pathways that involve cytokines , integrins and ECMs seem to be associated with odontoblast differentiation . In this cell culture , an aggregated cell mass becomes invaginated into ECM , a tissue becomes organized , and tubular matrix - forming cells are induced . Aggregation to form a cell mass occurred along with contraction of an artificial ECM . The velocity of aggregation on ECM was in the order of Matrigel alone > type I collagen - Matrigel - type III collagen > type I collagen - Matrigel . In general , cells form aggregates when the force of cell - cell contact is stronger than that of cell - substrate adhesion ( Ryan et al . 2001 ) . ECM contraction is mediated via attachment to cell surface receptors ( Schiro et al . 1991 ) . Based on these reports , the velocity of aggregation might be related to the amount of Matrigel in ECM . In such a process , invasion has been suggested to involve the relationship between ECM , proteolysis and integrin ( Davis et al . 2002 ; Galvez et al . 2002 ) . Proteolytic ECM remodeling not only removes ECM , but also provides a promigratory micro - environment ( Koshikawa et al . 2000 ; Galvez et al . 2002 ) . MMPs / MT - MMPs and serine or cysteine proteinases are involved ( Birkedal - Hansen 1995 ; Nagase and Woessner 1999 ) in such remodeling . In particular , BM remodeling might be due to proteolysis by MMPs / MT - MMPs ( Werb Fig . 7a , b Expression of DSPP in an aggregated cell mass in three - dimensional cell culture . ( a ) RT - PCR analysis . DMP 1 , DSPP and GAPDH in Matrigel alone . bp , base pair ( molecule standard ) . DMP 1 was expressed in all stages . DSPP was also expressed in all stages , but not in primary cultures . In either system consisting of type I collagen - Matrigel or type I collagen - Matrigel - type III collagen , a similar expression of these genes was observed . PCR amplifications were performed two to three times . Negative controls for DMP 1 and DSPP were amplified in the absence of the templates . P , primary cultures ; 3 , 3 days ; 5 , 5 days ; 7 , 7 days ; 10 , 10days ; 20 , 20 days ; 40 , 40 days ; N , negative control . ( b ) Western blots on DSPP ( DSP ) for extracts of the cell mass after 5 and 20 days of incubation . Antiserum ( LF - 153 ) that recognised parts of DSP portion of DSPP was used . Primary cultures ( lane 1 ) ; 5 and 20 days in Matrigel alone ( lanes 2 and 3 ) ; 5 and 20 days in type I collagen - Matrigel ( lanes 4 and 5 ) ; 5 and 20 days in type I collagen - Matrigel - type III collagen ( lanes 6 and 7 ) ; negative controls ( normal immunoglobulins , lane 8 ) . A band at about 210 kilo Dalton ( kD ) ( possibly DSPP or DSP isomer , ▲ ) was seen in lanes 2 to 7 compared to the molecular weight ( MW ) standard , but slight in lanes 5 and 7 . A band at about 110 kD ( possibly parts of cleaved DSPP or DSP isomer , △ ) was seen in lanes 2 , 3 , 6 and 7 , but faint in lanes 4 and 5 . A band at about 98 kD ( ▲ ) and a faint lower band ( possibly de - phosphorylated , de - glycosylated or truncated DSP , △ ) were recognised in lanes 2 to 7 , but faint in lanes 2 and 3 . In contrast to a slight band at about 210 kD in lanes 5 and 7 , an intense band at about 98 kD was visible in lanes 5 and 7 . In primary cultures ( lane 1 ) , some of very faint bands are visible 181 1997 ; Holmbeck et al . 1999 ) , or endocytosis ( Egeblads and Werb 2000 ; Hurley and Wendland 2002 ) . Indeed , MMPs / MT - MMPs are localized in dental pulp ( Caron et al . 1998 ; Palosaari et al . 2002 ) , enamel organ and BM ( Heikinheimo and Salo 1995 ; Randall and Hall 2002 ) . For activation , MMPs are dependent on MT - MMPs or integrins in collagen gel ( Ruangpanit et al . 2002 ) . MT - MMPs are likely to activate pro - MMPs ( Sato et al . 1994 ; Okada et al . 1997 ) . Plasminogen activators ( serine proteinases ) also induce active MMPs ( Jones et al . 2002 ) . The expression of MMP - 2 / MT 1 - MMP is also increased in endothelial tubulogenesis in fibrin gel ( Lafleur et al . 2002 ) . Similarly , invasive migration that does or does not depend on MT - MMPs occurs in a three - dimensional ECM ( Song et al . 2000 ; Hotary et al . 2002 ) . MMP - 2 is also colocalized with integrins and MT 1 - MMP in the pericellular space ( Brooks et al . 1996 ; Okada et al . 1997 ; Eliceiri and Cheresh 2001 ) and promotes cell migration ( Chen and Wang 1999 ) . Moreover , MT 1 - MMP promotes the formation of a cell mass in collagen gel ( Hotary et al . 2003 ) . Overall , these findings imply that invasive migration depends on pericellular proteolysis and involves integrins . In this study , during aggregation and invagination , the activities of MMP - 2 / MT 1 - MMP were seen at the outer multi - layers of cells within a cell mass adjacent to ECM . With regard to these activities , invasive migration by cryptic information from cleaved ECM components might occur at a new surface of proteolysed ECM , as evidenced by findings that cleaved laminin γ 2 components enhance cell migration ( Giannelli et al . 1997 ; Gilles et al . 2001 ) . Consequently , after migration to the new surface , cells might align as a row of new cells by cytokines possibly released from ECM . Indeed , the expression of MMPs / MT - MMPs is likely to be regulated by bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) - 2 and TGF - β s ( Tjäderhane et al . 1998 ; Song et al . 2000 ; Palosaari et al . 2002 ) . The increased expression of TGF - β 1 occurs in isolated dental papilla culture inducible odontoblast differentiation ( Kikuchi et al . 2001 ) . Thus , based on proteolytic activities , a certain cell population within the cell mass seems to migrate to a new structural surface of proteolysed ECM , organize into tissue and differentiate . In parallel with invagination , the DMP 1 and DSPP genes are expressed in an aggregated cell mass to induce tubular matrix - forming cells . DSP and DPP have been considered to be archetypal regulators in biomineralization processes ( Heuer et al . 1992 ; Thesleff and Nieminen 1996 ) . DSP is localized in young odontoblasts ( Bronckers Fig . 8a – h Distribution of DSP in an aggregated cell mass in three - dimensional cell culture . ( a ) Western blots on DSP for extracts of the cell mass after 5 and 20 days of incubation . Purified polyclonal antibodies ( M - 20 ) that recognised DSP were used . Primary cultures ( lane 1 ) ; 5 and 20 days in Matrigel alone ( lanes 2 and 3 ) ; 5 and 20 days in type I collagen - Matrigel ( lanes 4 and 5 ) ; 5 and 20 days in type I collagen - Matrigel - type III collagen ( lanes 6 and 7 ) ; negative controls ( normal immunoglobulins , lane 8 ) . Two bands ( a band at about 98 kilo Dalton ( kD ) , ▲ and a lower band , △ ) were recognised in lanes 2 to 7 compared to the molecular weight ( MW ) standard . As shown in Fig . 7 b , two bands at both about 210 kD and about 110 kD were not visible . No band was seen in primary cultures ( lane 1 ) .

Reactivities were also seen on cells in the cell mass under any condition .

No immunoreactivity was seen in dental pulp ( DP ) , pre - dentine ( PD ) , enamel organ ( EO ) , or in a layer of serially differentiating preodontoblasts ( dO ) on the labial side of rat lower incisors ( f ) . Reactivities were seen slightly on the outer enamel epithelium in enamel organ ( EO ) ( f ) . Reactivities were seen on the initially formed dentine ( D ; ∆ ) , young odontoblasts ( yO ) , and cells in blood vessel ( BV ) in the lingual side of rat lower incisors ( g ) . Reactivities were also seen on odontoblasts ( O ) , odontoblast processes and dentine ( D ) in parts of the lower second molars , but not on dental pulp ( DP ) and predentine ( PD ) ( h ) . Similar findings were obtained from both purified polyclonal antibodies ( M - 20 ) and antiserum ( LF - 153 ) .

DPP is tooth - specific and localized in functional odontoblasts ( D ’ Souza et al . 1997 ) . The DMP 1 gene is expressed in dental pulp / papilla and osteoblasts ( D ’ Souza et al . 1997 ; Feng et al . 2003 ) . It is also detected in young odontoblasts , but its expression decreases drastically in secretory odontoblasts ( George et al . 1993 ; D ’ Souza et al . 1997 ) . More recently , cells that express both the DSP and DPP genes have been induced by overexpression of the DMP 1 gene ( Narayanan et al . 2001 ) . This implies that a transfected DMP 1 gene can induce cells to express these genes . Essentially , the DMP 1 gene is also expressed in dental pulp / papilla ( D ’ Souza et al . 1997 ; Feng et al . 2003 ) . Similarly , in our cell cultures that are influenced by an artificial ECM , the DMP 1 gene is expressed , and this expression persists until the expression level declines at 40 days of incubation . Together with this gene , the DSPP gene is expressed at an early stage , but this expression then declines to low levels during mineralization . Thus , it is possible that both the DMP 1 and DSPP genes are coexpressed at an early stage , as evidenced by findings that both genes are coexpressed in developing and functional odontoblasts ( D ’ Souza et al . 1997 ; Braut et al . 2003 ) . Furthermore , DSP and DPP have been implicated as markers that are specific for odontoblast differentiation ( Lesot et al . 1994 ; D ’ Souza et al . 1995 ; Ruch et al . 1995 ) . However , the message of an mRNA transcript coded by a single DSPP gene coding both DSP and DPP ( MacDougall et al . 1997 ) has reportedly been detected in dentine , bone and their respective source cells ( Qin et al . 2002 ; Braut et al . 2003 ) , in dental pulp cells under inflammatory conditions ( Shiba et al . 2003 ) , and in other organs ( Xiao et al . 2001 ) . If so , a marker that is specific for odontoblast differen - tiation should by itself be evidence that tubular matrix or dentine is formed , since the difference between dentine and bone is largely due to a difference in the matrix structure . Moreover , the activity , function and morphology of cells in a three - dimensional microenvironment , includ - ing in vivo , are different from those in two dimensions ( Cukierman et al . 2001 ; Hotary et al . 2003 ) . In our cell cultures , similarly , gene expression might be different than that in two dimensions ( Narayanan et al . 2001 ) , pre - sumably because of unknown signals induced at the interface between a structural meshwork of ECM and an aggregated cell mass . However , the low expression of the DSPP gene during mineralization is similar to the low expression during dentinogenesis in grafts in vivo ( Gronthos et al . 2000 ) . There has been no serial study of the early stages of this gene in such dentinogenesis , although early expression of the DSPP gene might be the first signal for cues in odontoblast differentiation . Thus , tubular matrix - forming cells that contribute to mineraliza - tion and express these genes could be considered to have an odontoblast phenotype . In conclusion , the origin of stem cells / progenitor cells for regenerative odontoblasts remains unclear . In three - dimensional cell culture , however , we found that some populations of dental papilla cells can differentiate into tubular dentine - forming cells . This system is useful for studying stem cells / progenitor cells for regenerative odontoblasts , the mechanisms of dentinogenesis , and tissue engineering for the formation of artificial teeth .
