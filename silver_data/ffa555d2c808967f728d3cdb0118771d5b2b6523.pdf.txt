A sketch of the computational domain can be seen in Figure S1 . Furthermore , we equip our models with diﬀusion rates which are not necessarily constant along the cell compartments M cell and V cyt . Given some initial values u ( · , 0 ) on M cell and v ( · , 0 ) in V cyt , the model equations incorporating the described cell geometry and inhomogeneous diﬀusion read ∂u ∂t = ∇ Γ · ( D m ∇ Γ u ) + f ( u , v | M cell ) on M cell × [ 0 , T ] , ( 1 ) ∂v ∂t = ∇ · ( D c ∇ v ) in V cyt × [ 0 , T ] , ( 2 ) with boundary conditions − D c ∇ v · n = f ( u , v | M cell ) on M cell × [ 0 , T ] , ( 3 ) − D c ∇ v · n = 0 on M org × [ 0 , T ] ( 4 ) for the cytosolic equation ( 2 ) . Here , n denotes the vector ﬁeld of outer unit normals on M cell and M org , respectively . For this system of equations , we have mass conservation (cid:90) M cell u d A (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) molecules on the cell membrane + (cid:90) V cyt v d V (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) molecules in the cytosol = K for each t ∈ [ 0 , T ] , ( 5 ) where K ∈ R . This conservation property directly follows from the model equations’ weak formulation , see Section 2 . 1 . 2 Numerical methods used for simulations In the following , the numerical approach is described that is used for simulating the class of mathemat - ical models from Section 1 . As for all numerical approaches , the fundamental idea is to discretize the mathematical model . This process yields a system of algebraic equations which can be solved using a computer . To separate discretization in space and time , we use the well - known method of lines , see e . g . [ 1 ] , and start with a semidiscretization in space using conforming ﬁrst - order ﬁnite element methods based on triangular meshes . Given a triangular mesh which describes the geometrical setup introduced in 2 Section 1 , the equation for the volume species is treated by the standard conforming ﬁnite element approach , employing Lagrange basis functions of polynomial degree one . To treat the equation describing the membrane - bound species , we apply a surface ﬁnite element method on the boundary of the mesh using a restriction of the same volumetric basis functions . This enables implementing the numerical approach with tools provided by standard software frameworks for scientiﬁc computing . The idea of performing spatial discretization by combining the conforming ﬁnite element method and surface ﬁnite elements on the same mesh is related to the procedure presented in [ 2 ] , where a similar approach is used for the discretization of a coupled elliptic model problem . With the method of lines , diﬀerent schemes can be employed for the discretization in time . In accordance with our spatial discretization , we restrict ourselves to ﬁrst - order schemes . We use both a fully implicit scheme and a semi - implicit scheme inspired by the implicit - explicit ( IMEX ) Euler method presented e . g . in [ 3 ] . The idea of the IMEX method is to treat the spatially discretized reaction part of the system explicitly . Therefore , on the one hand the membrane equation and the cytosolic equation are decoupled and thus can be treated separately , and on the other hand the non - linearities are treated explicitly which enables using a linear solver . On the downside , an explicit treatment of the reaction part can aﬀect the stability of the scheme in the reaction - dominated case and for a stiﬀ reaction part in gereral [ 3 ] . Our semi - implicit scheme decouples membrane and cytosolic equations while still treating the reaction part of each separate equation and its non - linearities implicitly . For each equation , this is done by treating only the unknowns of the other equation explicitly . 2 . 1 Weak formulation First , we derive a weak formulation of model equations ( 1 ) – ( 4 ) in order to apply ﬁnite element methods for semidiscretization in space . Let V bulk : = H 1 ( V cyt ) denote the usual Sobolev space containing weak solutions of elliptic equations in the bulk domain V cyt . A natural counterpart containing weak solutions of elliptic equations on hypersurfaces are surface Sobolev spaces [ 4 – 6 ] . To treat equation ( 1 ) on the closed hypersurface M cell , we therefore deﬁne the surface Sobolev space V sur : = H 1 ( M cell ) . Multiplication of model equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) with some test functions ϕ m ∈ H 1 ( M cell ) respectively ϕ c ∈ H 1 ( V cyt ) results in d dt (cid:90) M cell u ϕ m d A = (cid:90) M cell ∇ Γ · ( D m ( x ) ∇ Γ u ) ϕ m d A + (cid:90) M cell f ( u , v | M cell ) ϕ m d A , ( 6 ) d dt (cid:90) V cyt v ϕ c d V = (cid:90) V cyt ∇ · ( D c ( x ) ∇ v ) ϕ c d V . ( 7 ) Application of the integration by parts formula for Sobolev spaces in ( 7 ) , and its analog derivable from the surface divergence theorem ( see [ 6 ] and references therein ) in ( 6 ) , yields d dt (cid:90) M cell u ϕ m d A = − (cid:90) M cell D m ( x ) ∇ Γ u · ∇ Γ ϕ m d A + (cid:90) M cell f ( u , v | M cell ) ϕ m d A , ( 8 ) d dt (cid:90) V cyt v ϕ c d V = − (cid:90) V cyt D c ( x ) ∇ v · ∇ ϕ c d V + (cid:90) ∂V cyt (cid:0) D c ( x ) ∇ v · n (cid:1) ϕ c | ∂V cyt d A . ( 9 ) Due to the boundary conditions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , together with ∂V cyt being the disjoint union M cell ∪ M org , 3 this is equivalent to d dt (cid:90) M cell u ϕ m d A = − (cid:90) M cell D m ( x ) ∇ Γ u · ∇ Γ ϕ m d A + (cid:90) M cell f ( u , v | M cell ) ϕ m d A , ( 10 ) d dt (cid:90) V cyt v ϕ c d V = − (cid:90) V cyt D c ( x ) ∇ v · ∇ ϕ c d V − (cid:90) M cell f ( u , v | M cell ) ϕ c | M cell d A . ( 11 ) The weak formulation of model equations ( 1 ) – ( 4 ) now is to look for a solution ( u , v ) ∈ L 2 ( [ 0 , T ] , V sur ) × L 2 ( [ 0 , T ] , V bulk ) , such that for each t ∈ [ 0 , T ] d dt (cid:90) M cell u ϕ m d A = − (cid:90) M cell D m ( x ) ∇ Γ u · ∇ Γ ϕ m d A + (cid:90) M cell f ( u , v | M cell ) ϕ m d A for all ϕ m ∈ V sur , ( 12 ) d dt (cid:90) V cyt v ϕ c d V = − (cid:90) V cyt D c ( x ) ∇ v · ∇ ϕ c d V − (cid:90) M cell f ( u , v | M cell ) ϕ c d A for all ϕ c ∈ V bulk . ( 13 ) Note that also the constant test functions ϕ m ≡ 1 respectively ϕ c ≡ 1 are permitted which yields mass conservation ( 5 ) . 2 . 2 Semidiscretization in space To obtain a semidiscretized system , we combine the conforming ﬁnite element approach ( FEM ) and a surface ﬁnite element method ( SFEM ) . The FEM is a standard approach which is well - known to literature . See e . g . [ 7 , 8 ] to gain an insight into the methodology . An SFEM developed in [ 5 ] can be seen as a natural generalization , as the idea of FEM is transfered to elliptic equations on hypersurfaces . Its extension [ 6 ] to treating parabolic equations , like membrane equation ( 1 ) , provides the basis for the SFEM that we use . Both approaches are based on an approximation of the bulk domain V cyt and the hypersurface M cell , each by a triangulable geometrical object , and corresponding meshes . For simplicity , we assume V cyt to be a polyhedral domain that can be exactly represented by a triangular mesh T bulk h . With M cell being part of the boundary of V cyt , it corresponds to a set of boundary entities of T bulk h which make up a surface mesh T sur h ⊂ T bulk h . Each method uses its corresponding mesh to set up a ﬁnite - dimensional function space usable for spatial discretization of the model equations . In particular , we replace the function spaces V sur and V bulk by ﬁnite - dimensional conforming function spaces V sur h ⊂ V sur respectively V bulk h ⊂ V bulk and seek a semidiscrete solution ( u h , v h ) ∈ L 2 ( [ 0 , T ] , V sur h ) × L 2 ( [ 0 , T ] , V bulk h ) , such that for each t ∈ [ 0 , T ] d dt (cid:90) M cell u h ϕ m , h d A = − (cid:90) M cell D m ( x ) ∇ Γ u h · ∇ Γ ϕ m , h d A + (cid:90) M cell f ( u h , v h | M cell ) ϕ m , h d A for all ϕ m , h ∈ V sur h , ( 14 ) d dt (cid:90) V cyt v h ϕ c , h d V = − (cid:90) V cyt D c ( x ) ∇ v h · ∇ ϕ c , h d V − (cid:90) M cell f ( u h , v h | M cell ) ϕ c , h d A for all ϕ c , h ∈ V bulk h . ( 15 ) As discrete function spaces , we employ the node - based Lagrange spaces of polynomial degree one on T sur h and T bulk h . With the basis functions (cid:8) ϕ x h m , h (cid:9) x h ∈X sur h of V sur h and the basis functions (cid:8) ϕ x h c , h (cid:9) x h ∈X bulk h of 4 V bulk h , where X sur h and X bulk h are the sets of nodes associated with the basis functions , we deduce d dt (cid:90) M cell u h ϕ x h m , h d A = − (cid:90) M cell D m ( x ) ∇ Γ u h · ∇ Γ ϕ x h m , h d A + (cid:90) M cell f ( u h , v h | M cell ) ϕ x h m , h d A for all x h ∈ X sur h , ( 16 ) d dt (cid:90) V cyt v h ϕ x h c , h d V = − (cid:90) V cyt D c ( x ) ∇ v h · ∇ ϕ x h c , h d V − (cid:90) M cell f ( u h , v h | M cell ) ϕ x h c , h d A for all x h ∈ X bulk h . ( 17 ) The semidiscrete solution ( u h , v h ) can be represented as u h = (cid:88) ˜ x h ∈X sur h b ˜ x h m ( t ) ϕ ˜ x h m , h and v h = (cid:88) ˜ x h ∈X bulk h b ˜ x h c ( t ) ϕ ˜ x h c , h ( 18 ) by time - dependent coeﬃcient vectors b m ( t ) = (cid:0) b ˜ x h m ( t ) (cid:1) ˜ x h ∈X sur h and b c ( t ) = (cid:0) b ˜ x h c ( t ) (cid:1) ˜ x h ∈X bulk h . Therefore , we get a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations M m · b m (cid:48) ( t ) + S m · b m ( t ) = f m (cid:0) b m ( t ) , b c ( t ) (cid:1) M c · b c (cid:48) ( t ) + S c · b c ( t ) = − f c (cid:0) b m ( t ) , b c ( t ) (cid:1) (cid:41) on [ 0 , T ] , ( 19 ) with mass and stiﬀness matrices M m : = (cid:18)(cid:90) M cell ϕ ˜ x h m , h ϕ x h m , h d A (cid:19) x h ∈X sur h , ˜ x h ∈X sur h , S m : = (cid:18)(cid:90) M cell D m ( x ) ∇ Γ ϕ ˜ x h m , h · ∇ Γ ϕ x h m , h d A (cid:19) x h ∈X sur h , ˜ x h ∈X sur h , ( 20 ) M c : = (cid:18)(cid:90) V cyt ϕ ˜ x h c , h ϕ x h c , h d A (cid:19) x h ∈X bulk h , ˜ x h ∈X bulk h , S c : = (cid:18)(cid:90) V cyt D c ( x ) ∇ ϕ ˜ x h c , h · ∇ ϕ x h c , h d A (cid:19) x h ∈X bulk h , ˜ x h ∈X bulk h , ( 21 ) and vector valued right hand side functions f m , f c , f m (cid:0) b m ( t ) , b c ( t ) (cid:1) : = (cid:18)(cid:90) M cell f (cid:16)(cid:88) ˜ x h ∈X sur h b ˜ x h m ( t ) ϕ ˜ x h m , h , (cid:88) ˜ x h ∈X bulk h b ˜ x h c ( t ) ϕ ˜ x h c , h | M cell (cid:17) ϕ x h m , h d A (cid:19) x h ∈X sur h , ( 22 ) f c (cid:0) b m ( t ) , b c ( t ) (cid:1) : = (cid:18)(cid:90) M cell f (cid:16)(cid:88) ˜ x h ∈X sur h b ˜ x h m ( t ) ϕ ˜ x h m , h , (cid:88) ˜ x h ∈X bulk h b ˜ x h c ( t ) ϕ ˜ x h c , h | M cell (cid:17) ϕ x h c , h d A (cid:19) x h ∈X bulk h . ( 23 ) 2 . 2 . 1 SFEM matrix / vector assembly via volumetric FEM basis functions As we use node - based Lagrange spaces of the same polynomial degree based on the same triangular mesh , the set of Lagrange nodes of V sur h can be described as X sur h = { x h ∈ X bulk h | x h ∈ M cell } ⊂ X bulk h . Moreover , the employed Lagrange basis functions have the property , that ϕ x h m , h = ϕ x h c , h | M cell ∀ x h ∈ X sur h . ( 24 ) Thus , instead of directly implementing the SFEM ansatz space V sur h , the constrained function space ∂ V bulk h : = { v ∈ V bulk h | v ( x h ) = 0 for x h ∈ X bulk h \ X sur h } ⊂ V bulk h ( 25 ) can be utilized to perform the assembly of M m , S m , f m and f c . In particular , the restriction of its basis (cid:8) ϕ x h c , h (cid:9) x h ∈X sur h to the set M cell equals the Lagrange basis (cid:8) ϕ x h m , h (cid:9) x h ∈X sur h of V sur h . Note that ∂ V bulk h (cid:54)⊂ V sur h . Hence , the surface component of the numerical solution can not be directly represented in the space ∂ V bulk h . Nevertheless , using the identity ∂ V bulk h | M cell = V sur h , the semidiscrete solution ( u h , v h ) ∈ L 2 ( [ 0 , T ] , V sur h ) × L 2 ( [ 0 , T ] , V bulk h ) can be calculated as u h = (cid:88) ˜ x h ∈X sur h b ˜ x h m ( t ) ϕ ˜ x h c , h | M cell and v h = (cid:88) ˜ x h ∈X bulk h b ˜ x h c ( t ) ϕ ˜ x h c , h . ( 26 ) 5 2 . 3 Fully discretized systems System ( 19 ) can be equivalently written as b m (cid:48) ( t ) = −M − 1 m S m · b m ( t ) + M − 1 m · f m (cid:0) b m ( t ) , b c ( t ) (cid:1) , ( 27 ) b c (cid:48) ( t ) = −M − 1 c S c · b c ( t ) − M − 1 c · f c (cid:0) b m ( t ) , b c ( t ) (cid:1) , ( 28 ) or as b (cid:48) ( t ) = −M − 1 S · b ( t ) + M − 1 · f (cid:0) b ( t ) (cid:1) on [ 0 , T ] , ( 29 ) using the notation M : = (cid:18) M m 0 0 M c (cid:19) , S : = (cid:18) S m 0 0 S c (cid:19) , b ( t ) : = (cid:18) b m ( t ) b c ( t ) (cid:19) and f (cid:0) b ( t ) (cid:1) : = (cid:18) f m (cid:0) b ( t ) (cid:1) f c (cid:0) b ( t ) (cid:1) (cid:19) . ( 30 ) For discretization in time , the interval [ 0 , T ] is split into sub - intervals [ t k , t k − 1 ] of length τ k : = t k − t k − 1 , k = 1 . . . , K , with 0 = t 0 < t 1 < · · · < t k < · · · < t K − 1 < t K = T . By b k we denote a time - dependent coeﬃcient vector b evaluated at t k . Employing the backward Euler method in ( 29 ) , we end up with a system of nonlinear algebraic equations b k = b k − 1 − τ M − 1 S · b k + τ M − 1 · f (cid:0) b k (cid:1) , k ∈ { 1 , . . . , K } , ( 31 ) which can be solved e . g . using a multidimensional Newton’s method . However , solving this fully dis - cretized system can get very time - consuming , especially when a ﬁne ﬁnite element mesh is used , as this results in high - dimensional coeﬃcient vectors . For this reason , we employ a semi - implicit scheme for temporal discretization which decouples equations ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) . In particular , we use the backward Euler method separately for each equation , while treating the unknowns of the other equation explicitly . In contrast to the IMEX Euler method ( see e . g . [ 3 ] ) , the unknowns of each separate equation are thus treated fully implicit . The fully discretized system then reads b km = b k − 1 m − τ M − 1 m S m · b km + τ M − 1 m · f m (cid:0) b km , b k − 1 c (cid:1) b kc = b k − 1 c − τ M − 1 c S c · b kc + τ M − 1 c · f c (cid:0) b k − 1 m , b kc (cid:1) (cid:41) k ∈ { 1 , . . . , K } ( 32 ) and can be solved e . g . using a multidimensional Newton’s method for both equations in parallel . Our experiments have shown no obvious qualitative diﬀerences between the solutions computed with both schemes ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) . 2 . 4 Simulation framework The presented numerical approach can be implemented with tools provided by standard PDE software frameworks . For the assembly of the required matrices , the framework has to provide the space of simplicial Lagrange ﬁnite elements of order one on a triangular mesh . Furthermore , it either has to provide the space of simplicial Lagrange ﬁnite elements of order one on the boundary of the same mesh or a mechanism for constraining the degrees of freedom of the volumetric Lagrange space which do not lie on the boundary of the mesh . The latter mechanism usually is available in those frameworks , since constrained degrees of freedom are frequently used to implement Dirichlet boundary conditions . All of our simulations were performed using the Distributed and Uniﬁed Numerics Environment ( DUNE ) [ 9 , 10 ] . The numerical discretization schemes were implemented using the discretization module DUNE - PDELab which is based on DUNE . It provides the volumetric ﬁnite element space V bulk h which in addition can be constrained for SFEM matrix / vector assembly using the space ∂ V bulk h . Furthermore , it features an easy to use assembly infrastructure , as well as the linear solver , nonlinear solver and time - stepping schemes that were used . 6 The ﬁnite element meshes were generated with Gmsh [ 11 ] , examples of which are depicted in Figure S4 . All of these meshes comprise several thousand elements to guarantee a high precision of the method . Additionally , meshes are reﬁned near the outer cell membrane M cell in our simulations to enable an accurate computation of the coupling process on the surface . All code and meshes used in this work are freely available from the authors on request . 2 . 5 Alternative approaches An alternative approach usable for simulating the mathematical models is presented in [ 12 ] . It uses an implicit description of the cellular geometry via level set functions and seems to be promising especially in the context of geometrical setups that are more complex than those investigated in this work , like those arising from real microscopy data . Particularly , it might be useful for coping with a cellular geometry that even evolves in time . Furthermore , already for simple geometries it can be advantageous as there is no need for a customized mesh generation . This can ease the simulation workﬂow . A similar approach can be found in [ 13 ] , which also has the advantage of using an implicit geometry description , but uses a diﬀuse - interface representation via a phase - ﬁeld function . Another alternative approach is presented in [ 14 ] and implemented in the cell modeling and simulation software Virtual Cell [ 15 ] . Though employing a cell - centered ﬁnite volume scheme on a regular mesh and thus approximating the membrane M cell in a staircase manner , convergence results for static spherical geometries are presented in [ 14 ] that render the method well - suited in the considered case . 3 Linear stability analysis We used linear stability analysis as in [ 16 ] to capture the essential behavior and parameter dependencies of the GOR and WP model . For the analysis we consider the following simpliﬁcations . First , we assume the computational domain to have a circular shape with radius R ∈ R , centered at the origin of ordinates . In polar coordinates ( r , φ ) , the Laplace - Beltrami operator on the boundary can then be expressed as ∆ Γ = ∆ φ | r = R = 1 R 2 ∂ 2 h ∂φ 2 , where we deﬁne ∆ φ : = 1 r 2 ∂ 2 h ∂φ 2 . Note that ∆ = ∆ r + ∆ φ in polar coordinates , with ∆ r : = ∂ 2 ∂r 2 + 1 r ∂∂r . Second , we assume that there are no inhomogeneities on the membrane as well as in the cytosol . Expressed in polar coordinates , the equations from Section 1 then read ∂u ( φ , t ) ∂t = D m ∆ φ u ( φ , t ) + f ( u ( φ , t ) , v ( R , φ , t ) ) on { R } × [ 0 , 2 π ) × [ 0 , T ] , ( 33 ) ∂v ( r , φ , t ) ∂t = D c (cid:2) ∆ r + ∆ φ (cid:3) v ( r , φ , t ) in [ 0 , R ) × [ 0 , 2 π ) × [ 0 , T ] , ( 34 ) with only one boundary condition − D c ∂ ∂rv ( r , φ , t ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r = R = f ( u ( φ , t ) , v ( R , φ , t ) ) on { R } × [ 0 , 2 π ) × [ 0 , T ] ( 35 ) for the cytosolic equation ( 34 ) . Let ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 ) be a steady state of our system such that f ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 ) = 0 . We consider small perturbations from this steady state which are described by functions ξ m = u − ¯ u 0 and ξ c = v − ¯ v 0 . For these perturbations , we have ∂ξ m ∂t ( φ , t ) = D m ∆ φ ξ m ( φ , t ) + f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) ξ m ( φ , t ) + f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) ξ c ( r , φ , t ) , ( 36 ) ∂ξ c ∂t ( r , φ , t ) = D c (cid:2) ∆ r + ∆ φ (cid:3) ξ c ( r , φ , t ) ( 37 ) in the linear regime , and boundary condition − D c ∂ ∂rξ c ( r , φ , t ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r = R = f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) ξ m ( φ , t ) + f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) ξ c ( R , φ , t ) . ( 38 ) 7 3 . 1 Power series expansion using two - dimensional polar harmonics as ansatz Since R 2 ∆ Γ h = ∂ 2 h ∂φ 2 = − k 2 h for h ( φ ) = cos ( kφ ) and h ( φ ) = sin ( kφ ) , the eigenfunctions of ∆ φ | r = R are the sine and cosine functions . Therefore , we expand the functions ξ m and ξ c as follows : ξ m ( φ , t ) = ∞ (cid:88) k = 0 ξ km ( φ , t ) , ξ km ( φ , t ) : = (cid:2) a km cos ( kφ ) + b km sin ( kφ ) (cid:3) exp ( λ k t ) , ( 39 ) ξ c ( r , φ , t ) = ∞ (cid:88) k = 0 ξ kc ( r , φ , t ) , ξ kc ( r , φ , t ) : = A k ( r ) (cid:2) a kc cos ( kφ ) + b kc sin ( kφ ) (cid:3) exp ( λ k t ) . ( 40 ) Due to linearity of the linearized system ( 36 ) – ( 38 ) with respect to solutions ( ξ m , ξ c ) , it is suﬃcient to identify solutions ( ξ km , ξ kc ) , as deﬁned in equations ( 39 ) – ( 40 ) , via their corresponding parameters ﬁrst . We thus determine the parameters a km , b km , a kc , b kc and λ k separately for each k = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . . Inserting the ansatz for ξ kc into cytosolic equation ( 37 ) , we get r 2 λ k A k ( r ) (cid:2) a kc cos ( kφ ) + b kc sin ( kφ ) (cid:3) exp ( λ k t ) = − D c k 2 A k ( r ) (cid:2) a kc cos ( kφ ) + b kc sin ( kφ ) (cid:3) exp ( λ k t ) + D c r 2 ( ∆ r A k ( r ) ) (cid:2) a kc cos ( kφ ) + b kc sin ( kφ ) (cid:3) exp ( λ k t ) . After canceling , this takes the form r 2 λ k A k ( r ) = − D c k 2 A k ( r ) + D c r 2 ( ∆ r A k ( r ) ) , which leads to 0 = (cid:20) r 2 ∂ 2 ∂r 2 + r ∂ ∂r − k 2 − λ k r 2 / D c (cid:21) A k ( r ) . Mathematical solutions of this equation are modiﬁed Bessel functions of the ﬁrst kind . We thus obtain A k ( r ) = I k ( r (cid:112) λ k / D c ) . Inserting ξ km and ξ kc into cytosolic boundary condition ( 38 ) , we get − D c ∂ ∂rI k ( r (cid:112) λ k / D c ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r = R (cid:2) a kc cos ( kφ ) + b kc sin ( kφ ) (cid:3) exp ( λ k t ) = f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) (cid:2) a km cos ( kφ ) + b km sin ( kφ ) (cid:3) exp ( λ k t ) + f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) I k ( R (cid:112) λ k / D c ) (cid:2) a kc cos ( kφ ) + b kc sin ( kφ ) (cid:3) exp ( λ k t ) , Since the choice of φ is arbitrary , this leads to a kc = − f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) a km D c ∂∂r I k ( r (cid:112) λ k / D c ) (cid:12)(cid:12) r = R + f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) I k ( R (cid:112) λ k / D c ) , ( 41 ) b kc = − f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) b km D c ∂∂r I k ( r (cid:112) λ k / D c ) (cid:12)(cid:12) r = R + f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) I k ( R (cid:112) λ k / D c ) . ( 42 ) Therefore , a kc as well as b kc can be expressed in terms of the coeﬃcients a km and b km , respectively . This yields ξ kc ( r , φ , t ) = − f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) I k ( r (cid:112) λ k / D c ) [ a km cos ( kφ ) + b k m sin ( kφ ) ] exp ( λ k t ) D c ∂∂r I k ( r (cid:112) λ k / D c ) (cid:12)(cid:12) r = R + f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) I k ( R (cid:112) ( λ k / D c ) . 8 Putting ξ km and ξ kc into equation ( 36 ) for processes on the membrane , we can deduce λ k [ a km cos ( kφ ) + b km sin ( kφ ) ] exp ( λ k t ) = − D m k 2 R 2 [ a km cos ( kφ ) + b km sin ( kφ ) ] exp ( λ k t ) + f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) [ a km cos ( kφ ) + b km sin ( kφ ) ] exp ( λ k t ) − f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) I k ( R (cid:112) λ k / D c ) [ a km cos ( kφ ) + b km sin ( kφ ) ] exp ( λ k t ) D c ∂∂r I k ( r (cid:112) λ k / D c ) (cid:12)(cid:12) r = R + f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) I k ( R (cid:112) ( λ k / D c ) ) . After canceling the nonzero terms , we ﬁnally get λ k = f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) − D m k 2 R 2 − f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) I k ( R (cid:112) λ k / D c ) D c ∂ ∂r I k ( r (cid:112) λ k / D c ) (cid:12) (cid:12) r = R + f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) I k ( R (cid:112) λ k / D c ) . ( 43 ) Note that initial conditions for system ( 36 ) – ( 38 ) would be required in order to determine the free parameters a km and b km . Having an equation for the parameters λ k , we now want to identify conditions which lead to growing eigenmodes . Following [ 17 ] , the derivative of I k can be expressed as ∂ ∂rI k ( r (cid:112) λ k / D c ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r = R = I k + 1 ( R (cid:112) λ k / D c ) (cid:112) λ k / D c + k RI k ( R (cid:112) λ k / D c ) . Since I k ( x ) > 0 for x > 0 and for all k = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . , we have the inequality ∂ ∂rI k ( r (cid:112) λ k / D c ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r = R ≥ k RI k ( R (cid:112) λ k / D c ) . We use this inequality for the derivative ∂∂r I k and furthermore assume f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) , f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) ≥ 0 . This holds true for the GOR model in the stable steady state and for their WP model in the transient steady state ( ¯ v 0 , ¯ u T 0 ) , where phase seperation occurs . Therfore , we obtain : λ k = f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) − D m k 2 R 2 − f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) I k ( R (cid:112) λ k / D c ) D c ∂∂r I k ( r (cid:112) λ k / D c ) (cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12) r = R + f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) I k ( R (cid:112) λ k / D c ) ≥ f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) − D m k 2 R 2 − f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) D c kR + f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) . This ﬁnally yields the following inequality for λ k : f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) − D m k 2 R 2 − f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) D c kR + f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) ≤ λ k ≤ f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) − D m k 2 R 2 . ( 44 ) In a physiological range , the term f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) Dck R + f v ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) is very small and we get λ k ≈ f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) − D m k 2 R 2 . 9 For k = 0 , the fundamental solutions ξ 0 m ( φ , t ) = a 0 m exp ( λ 0 t ) and ξ 0 c ( r , φ , t ) = A 0 ( r ) a 0 c exp ( λ 0 t ) do not depend on the polar angle φ and , therefore , do not contribute to cellular asymmetry . Hence , we only consider wave numbers k = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . in the following . For cell sizes R small with λ 1 ≈ f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) − D m 1 2 R 2small < 0 ⇔ R small < (cid:115) D m f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) , we have no growing eigenmodes since λ 1 (cid:38) λ 2 (cid:38) . . . . For cell sizes R large with λ 2 ≈ f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) − D m 2 2 R 2large > 0 ⇔ R large > 2 (cid:115) D m f u ( ¯ u 0 , ¯ v 0 | r = R ) , we have more than one growing eigenmode and therefore several clusters . 4 Cluster width approximation for the WP model In the following , we want to examine the size of the cluster for the WP model analytically . Stimulation of the system , as performed in the simulations in the main text , causes a traveling wave on the cell surface that is pinned due to mass conservation . The cluster grows mainly in width but only slightly in height . In addition to the POL measure from the main text which describes the relative height of the cluster , we therefore introduce a new measure for the relative cluster width as follows : POL W : = | M + | | M cell | , ( 45 ) where M + is the excited region of the cell surface . The excited region of the cell surface is deﬁned as that part of the surface , where the surface concentration u is higher than the average surface concentration ¯ u : M + : = { x ∈ M cell : u ( x ) > ¯ u } , ¯ u : = 1 | M cell | (cid:90) M cell u d A . Therefore , the POL W measure compares the size of the excited part and the total surface area of the cell . Due to the structure of the reaction kinetics of the WP model , the concentration level of active molecules u on the cell surface separates the cell surface into two parts . The excited part M + ⊂ M cell of the cell surface is at concentration level u + and the part M − = M cell \ M + which is not excited is at concentration level u − . At steady state , the concentration in the volume is almost equally distributed and takes the value v c . The cytosolic concentration v c is in the range of parameters where f ( · , v c ) has three roots u − , u T and u + , with u − < u T < u + . The critical steady state concentration v c can be calculated solving the Maxwell condition [ 18 ] : 0 = u + (cid:90) u − f ( u , v c ) d u , with respect to f ( u − , v c ) = f ( u + , v c ) = 0 . Note that the value for v c is independent of the cell size . We obtained the values v c ≈ 0 . 179 µM , u − ≈ 0 . 017 µm µM and u + ≈ 0 . 11 µm µM . Due to mass conservation , in steady state the approximation | M + | u + + ( | M cell | − | M + | ) u − + | V cell | v c ≈ | M cell | u ( 0 ) + | V cell | v ( 0 ) 10 holds . Solving this equation for the excited area of the cell surface | M + | , we get | M + | ≈ | M cell | ( u ( 0 ) − u − ) + | V cell | ( v ( 0 ) − v c ) u + − u − . Using this relation , we can easily approximate the POL W measure : POL W ≈ 1 u + − u − (cid:18) ( u ( 0 ) − u − ) + | V cell | | M cell | ( v ( 0 ) − v c ) (cid:19) . ( 46 ) In the case of a circular cell , this becomes POL W ≈ 1 u + − u − (cid:18) ( u ( 0 ) − u − ) + R d ( v ( 0 ) − v c ) (cid:19) , ( 47 ) where d = 2 is the dimension of the computational representation of the cell . Therefore , the relative cluster width grows linearly with the cell size . Note that for the corresponding 1D model , the ratio | V cell | | M cell | is constant and the approximated relative cluster width in ( 46 ) becomes independent of the cell size . A comparison of the simulated and the approximated relative cluster width is presented in Figure S6 . References 1 .

In case of the GOR model , we obtain two homogeneous steady states . The ﬁrst steady state at u 1 = 0 is stable while the second at u 2 > 0 is transient ; e . g . we have a membrane / cytosolic ﬂux on the membrane for u > u 2 ( region II in the plots ) and a dissociation to the cytosol for u < u 2 ( region I in the plots ) . In case of the WP model , we observe a bimodal behavior . For the shown range of values for v , we can either have one , two or three steady states . If there are three steady states , say u 1 , u 2 and u 3 with u 1 < u 2 < u 3 , the steady states u 1 and u 3 are stable while u 2 is transient . If the membrane concentration u is in the regions I or III of the plots , there is a ﬂux from the cytosol to the membrane . If the membrane concentration u is in the regions II or IV , there is a dissociation from the membrane to the cytosol . 14 GOR WP 0 . 0 5 . 0 10 . 0 15 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 1 . 2 1 . 6 t = 120s t = 40s t = 20s t = 250s t = 100s t = 20s t = 120s t = 40s t = 20s t = 250s t = 100s t = 20s 0 . 0 5 . 0 10 . 0 15 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 1 . 2 1 . 6 0 . 0 5 . 0 10 . 0 15 . 0 0 . 0 5 . 0 10 . 0 15 . 0 10 20 30 40 50 10 20 30 40 50 arclength arclength arclength arclength c on c en t r a t i on c on c en t r a t i on c on c en t r a t i on c on c en t r a t i on 2D 1D Figure S3 Comparison of a simulation performed in 2D ( left ) and in 1D ( right ) .

Stimulus S1 at the top prevails only if the organelle is suﬃciently far away , i . e . , if it has a bottom position .

Both signals are persistent and deﬁned by k S ( x , t ) = c · (cid:0) x 2 − ( x min ) 2 (cid:1) , where x min is the lowest point along the x 2 - direction of the two dimensional cell ( opposite side of the protrusion ) . For the weak gradient , we choose c = 1 . 0 · 10 − 4 and for the strong gradient , we choose the ten - fold higher value c = 1 . 0 · 10 − 3 . The signals are plotted along the surface of each cell shape ( see top ﬁgures of A and B ) . In case of the WP model , the simulations show that the system is strongly shape - dependend . The circular cell polarizes toward the gradient as expected . On the contrary , for the cell with a protrusion , polarization is either strongly delayed ( strong gradient ) or occurs on the opposite side of the protrusion ( weak gradient ) .
