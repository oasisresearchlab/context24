Tumour progression is a multistep process involving aberrations in various signalling pathways that result in a survival advantage for transformed cells . In most cases the clinical problem of tumorigenesis is not the primary tumour , as it can be surgically removed , but its malignant transformation and metastatic spread , which is the main cause of death in cancer patients 1 . Therefore , understanding the signalling mechanisms underlying the metastatic cascade of cancer is crucial to identifying new treatment options for anticancer therapy that target invasion and metastasis . Dissemination of cancer cells from the primary tumour , invasion into the local surrounding tissue , intra­ vasation into blood or lymphatic vessels , extravasation and the final colonization at distant organs represent the different steps of the metastatic cascade and involve a multitude of changes in cellular behaviour 2 . One of the first , and most crucial , steps of the metastatic cascade is the acquisition of invasive capabilities , which is accompa­ nied by various changes in gene expression and function ; for example , the loss of epithelial and gain of mesen­ chymal markers 3 . In almost all steps of metastatic spread , the reorganization and reassembly of the actin cytoskel­ eton is absolutely necessary for invasive cell behaviour , such as the dissolution of cell – cell contacts , protrusion formation , force generation to overcome physical resist­ ance of three­dimensional tissue networks and motility . Depending on the tumour type and the crosstalk with the tumour microenvironment , cancer cells use different invasion modes , which can be roughly separated into amoeboid , mesenchymal and collective mode of inva­ sion 4 . The amoeboid mode of invasion is defined by an amorphous or round cell shape that can be accompanied by dynamic , non­apoptotic plasma membrane blebbing 5 . This motility mode uses high contractility to squeeze through the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and can occur independently of extracellular proteolysis 6 , although metalloproteinase activity may still be required for amoeboid migration through a dense crosslinked colla­ gen matrix 7 . In the mesenchymal invasion mode , cancer cells adopt an elongated morphology , and migration is accomplished by dissolution of the ECM at the cell front , actin­driven leading edge protrusion , the formation of new contacts at the cell front and rear retraction 8 . The collective mode of invasion is characterized by invading cell strands or sheets that show intact cell – cell adhesions and requires proteolytic degradation of the ECM 4 . Actin assembly inside cells is directly regulated and enhanced by various proteins that mediate de novo nucle­ ation of filaments ( FIG . 1 ) , which provide the driving force in the formation of protrusive membrane structures , such as non­apoptotic membrane blebs , invadopodia or pseudopodia ( FIG . 2 ) . For a detailed description of actin nucleation factors and their regulation , we refer to recent excellent reviews 9 , 10 . In contrast to the chemotherapeutic agents that target microtubules , which have been used in anticancer treatments for decades , drugs specifically tar­ geting actin have not yet been reported . However , many proteins affecting actin cytoskeletal dynamics , such as Rho GTPases 11 , 12 , cofilin and LIM kinase 13 , are thought to exert key functions in tumorigenesis and metastasis . This Review focuses on the function of the mechanisti­ cally different actin nucleation factors that affect cancer cell motility and metastasis , and highlights new inhibi­ tors of actin assembly proteins as future targets for anticancer or anti­invasive therapy .

Nucleating actin for invasion Alexander Nürnberg * , Thomas Kitzing ‡ and Robert Grosse * Abstract | The invasion of cancer cells into the surrounding tissue is a prerequisite and initial step in metastasis , which is the leading cause of death from cancer . Invasive cell migration requires the formation of various structures , such as invadopodia and pseudopodia , which require actin assembly that is regulated by specialized actin nucleation factors . There is a large variety of different actin nucleators in human cells , such as formins , spire and Arp2 / 3‑regulating proteins , and the list is likely to grow . Studies of the mechanisms of various actin nucleation factors that are involved in cancer cell function may ultimately provide new treatments for invasive and metastatic disease .

ADF / coﬁlin family ) Capping protein ATP ADP Pi + – + + – – which are composed of two twisted helices 14 , 15 . The onset of the reaction is slow owing to the considerable insta­ bility of actin oligomers ; once an unstable actin trimer , known as the nucleus , is formed , actin polymerization proceeds quickly at the fast­growing plus end , and more slowly at the minus end 14 , 16 ( FIG . 1 ) . It is the incorpora­ tion of new actin subunits at the plus end that provides mechanical force for the generation of membrane protru­ sions in migrating cells . Therefore , actin dynamics must be tightly controlled and regulated in vivo 16 . Capping proteins can associate with the plus or minus end , thus preventing filament elongation or inhibiting depolym­ erization , respectively 17 , 18 . Monomer binding proteins control the availability of subunits for filament assem­ bly , whereas severing proteins , such as members of the destrin ( also known as ADF ) and cofilin family , regulate disassembly 18 ( FIG . 1 ) . The kinetic barrier that prevents spontaneous actin polymerization provides the cell with a flexible instrument for spatial and temporal control of the de novo actin filament assembly . In response to extracellular signals , actin nucleators can rapidly and efficiently initiate new actin filaments by direct nucleation of actin 9 , 10 . These proteins are tar­ gets of multiple intracellular signalling cascades . Most importantly , members of the Rho­GTPase family , such as CDC42 , Rac and Rho ( reviewed in ReF . 19 ) , are crucial regulators of actin turnover and coordinate the control of actin nucleating activities . Formin homology proteins in invasive disease Formins are the largest group of directly regulated Rho­ GTPase effectors . Mammalian formins are represented by 15 different family members 20 , 21 . They are defined by the presence of the highly conserved formin homology 2 ( FH2 ) domain , which is often necessary and sufficient to promote actin assembly 22 , 23 . The preceding FH1 domain can bind profilin – actin to accelerate the elongation of actin filaments at the plus end 24 . The activity of formins is tightly regulated through auto­inhibitory interactions between amino­terminal and carboxy­terminal regions often referred to as the Diaphanous inhibitory domain ( DID ) and Diaphanous autoregulatory domain ( DAD ) , respectively ( TABLe 1 ) . In general , activated Rho­GTPases help to relieve auto­inhibition through specific interac­ tion with the GTPase­binding domain ( GBD ) of form­ ins . Once activated , formins form dimers and their FH2 domains can promote the processive incorporation of actin monomers into the plus end of the growing actin filament 25 . As formins are among the most potent actin nuclea­ tors they have emerged as potentially valuable candidates for anti­invasive drug targets . sequencing analysis of can­ cer genomes from patients with glioblastoma or pancre­ atic cancer 26 , 27 identified missense mutations in several formins , including formin­like 2 ( FMnL2 ; also known as FHOD2 ) and FMnL3 , but their functional consequences have not yet been investigated . Although little is known about the physiological relevance of formin proteins in humans ( TABLe 2 ) , several recent reports have described their involvement in cancer cell motility and tumour pro­ gression . The first mammalian Diaphanous­related form­ ins to be identified , such as diaphanous homologue 1 ( Diap1 ; also known as mDia1 ) , have been implicated in malignant disease through their functional associa­ tion with the proto­oncogenic sRC tyrosine kinases 28 , 29 . Human diaphanous homologue 1 ( DIAPH1 ) was shown to be required for invasive cancer cell migration through three­dimensional matrices 30 , as well as for invado­ podia formation in motile breast tumour cells 31 ( FIG . 2 ) . Furthermore , DIAPH1 mediates the pro­migratory phenotype downstream of RHOA that is associated with the loss or the downregulation of the tumour suppressor Figure 1 | actin nucleation and turnover . Spontaneous actin polymerization is hampered by the unfavourable kinetics of actin oligomer formation ( shown by the thick and thin arrows ) . Once an actin nucleus is formed , the association of monomers proceeds quickly , with one end , designated the plus end , growing much faster than the other , the minus end . ATPase activity of actin strongly increases on incorporation into the filament . Spontaneous hydrolysis of ATP and the dissociation of phosphate destabilize the filament and render it more susceptible to the action of severing proteins , such as members of the actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin family . Dissociated ADP‑actin undergoes nucleotide exchange , which is strongly facilitated by profilin . Profilin binds monomeric actin and controls filament assembly by interacting with formins . Capping proteins , such as gelsolin , can associate with the growing plus end and inhibit filament elongation . At a glance • Actin polymerization inside cells is initiated by actin nucleation factors . Reassembly of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for invasive cell migration . Understanding the specific mechanisms of action and regulation of the diverse and growing number of actin nucleators is likely to provide new ideas for developing treatments that inhibit cancer spread and inflammatory conditions . • Actin nucleators such as formins or the Arp2 / 3 complex and nucleation - promoting factors have numerous and diverse functions in invasive cancer cell migration , including the formation of protrusive structures , assembly of cell – cell contacts and matrix degradation . In addition , they have been implicated in the regulation of proinvasive signalling pathways . • There is now a large body of clinical evidence for specific roles of actin nucleators in cancer progression . Importantly , many of these factors seem to be associated with advanced disease and the metastatic spread of human cancers . • Actin nucleation factors now emerge as promising targets for therapeutic intervention in metastatic and invasive or inflammatory diseases . The first small - molecule inhibitors of actin nucleators have been reported very recently .

Additional evidence for a role of DIAPH1 in tumour cell motility and inva­ dopodia function stems from recent in vivo findings of Diap1 ­deficient , sRC­transformed cells that fail to form tumours or invade surrounding tissues in nude mice 33 . The authors conclude that DIAPH1 may have a pivotal role in the disease progression of various cancers overexpressing the SRC oncogene . In addition to the formation of tumour cell inva­ dopodia , DIAPH1 is also necessary for bleb­associated cancer cell invasion and amoeboid leukocyte migra­ tion . In this case , DIAPH1 mediates a positive feedback mechanism through the leukaemia­associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) LARG that stimulates RHOA – ROCK signalling 30 , 34 . Other mem­ bers of the formin protein family , such as FH1 , FH2 domain­containing protein 1 ( FHOD1 ) and FMnL1 , are also involved in plasma membrane blebbing , but the underlying mechanisms remain to be investigated 35 , 36 . By contrast , deletion of DIAPH3 or small interfering RnA ( siRnA ) ­mediated knock down of DIAPH3 , the human homologue of mDia2 , induces potent plasma membrane blebbing in prostate cancer cells that cor­ relates with oncogenic signalling and metastatic dis­ ease 37 . Interestingly , the inhibitory role of this formin for cancer cell bleb formation seems to be conserved in mouse Diap3 ( ReF . 38 ) , suggesting that this formin might function as a tumour suppressor rather than as a tumour promoter . nevertheless , how and which formins control plasma membrane blebbing and bleb dynamics , and whether specific actin nucleation activities are necessary for certain steps of this process , remain to be shown . More evidence for a role of formins in malignant disease comes from findings that FMnL1 is strongly overexpressed in T cell non­Hodgkin’s lymphoma 39 . Consistent with this , FMnL1 was found to be upregu­ lated in different lymphatic , lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukaemias 40 . Of note , allosteric T cells specific for a human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) ­A2­presented FMnL1 antigenic peptide displayed potent antitumour effects against various cancer cell types 40 . Therefore , this may present a promising concept for targeting formins for the development of adoptive therapies in cancer . Figure 2 | Typical protrusive structures in invasive cancer cells . Cancer cell invasive phenotypes involve the formation of typical protrusive structures , such as plasma membrane blebs , invadopodia or pseudopodia , which are dependent on the nucleation and assembly of filamentous actin . Non‑apoptotic blebs are highly dynamic protrusions in which the plasma membrane bulks out owing to increased hydrostatic pressure on regions of weak cortical actin 131 . The initial , protruding bleb is devoid of detectable F‑actin , which becomes repolymerized during bleb retraction by unknown actin nucleation factors . Ezrin is recruited into the growing bleb , and formins seem to have a role in bleb formation through mechanisms that still need to be defined 132 . Invadopodia are actin‑rich cellular protrusions that are tailored for the degradation of the extracellular matrix . The formation of invadopodia relies on N‑WASP – Arp2 / 3‑driven actin assembly ( FIG . 4 ) and requires cortactin for invadopodia initiation and stabilization . Pseudopodia of cancer cells are lamellipodia‑like structures and depend on the polymerization and assembly of actin by the WAVE – Arp2 / 3 nucleation machinery .

All rights reserved In addition , the closely related FMnL2 was found to be upregulated in patient samples of metastatic color­ ectal cancer 41 , which suggests that FMnL2 might be a useful marker in this disease . In a functional screen for the role of all human formins on cancer cell invasive­ ness , FMnL2 was identified as a factor involved in the amoeboid mode of invasion 42 . In order to identify bind­ ing partners between Rho proteins and formins , a coun­ ter screen against the human Rho proteins on invasive behaviour was carried out . By this approach , the metas­ tasis gene RHOC was found to interact with and regulate FMnL2 ( ReF . 42 ) , which points towards a possible role of this Rho – formin module in invasive disease . It will be interesting to elucidate whether FMnL2 , like RHOC , is required for metastasis in vivo . Formins in transcription . One important consequence of actin nucleation and assembly by formins and other actin nucleators is the compartmental and transcrip­ tional regulation of the serum response factor ( sRF ) co­activator MAL through dynamic interactions with actin monomers 43 ( FIG . 3 ) . Release of actin from MAL stimulates sRF­dependent gene expression , which pro­ motes cancer cell invasion and metastasis in mice 44 . Consistently , a novel transcriptional regulator sup­ pressor of cancer cell invasion ( sCAI ) was identified through association with DIAPH1 , and it controls β1 integrin expression in motile tumour cells through the regulation of nuclear MAL 45 . Thus , actin assembly fac­ tors , such as formins , may cooperate with transcrip­ tional events and have a synergistic effect on invasive cell migration . The Arp2 / 3 complex and metastasis The actin­related protein 2 ( ARP2 ; encoded by ACTR2 ) and ARP3 complex ( known as the Arp2 / 3 complex ) was the first actin nucleation factor to be identified . The complex has little nucleation activity and requires the aid of nucleation­promoting factors ( nPFs ) to initiate a new actin filament 10 ( FIG . 4 ) . In a widely used model 46 – 48 , the Arp2 / 3 complex binds to an existing actin fila­ ment and together with an nPF initiates a new filament branch . Another recent model suggests the recruitment of Arp2 / 3 by a membrane­bound nPF and subsequent filament initiation at the plasma membrane without the contribution of the existing filamentous actin 49 , 50 . Actin elongation factors from the enabled / vasodilator­stimulated phosphoprotein ( Ena / vAsP ) family of proteins , as well as formins , cooperate with nPFs in the assembly of actin filament networks 9 , as Arp2 / 3 does not possess elonga­ tion activity and remains associated with the minus end of the nucleated filament 46 , 51 . The Arp2 / 3 complex . In cancer cells , actin nucleation through the Arp2 / 3 complex is essential for mesenchymal invasion , as the formation of both lamellipodia 52 and inva­ dopodia 53 depends on Arp2 / 3 . The expression of Arp2 / 3 is strongly increased in a rat model of a metastatic primary breast tumour and correlates with the increased chemo­ taxis of these metastatic cancer cells 54 . similarly , invasive cells collected from mouse primary breast tumours in an in vivo invasion assay show an increased expression of Arp2 / 3 ( ReFS 55 , 56 ) . Therefore , increased Arp2 / 3 expression seems to promote tumour invasion in vivo .

Thus , this finding implicates a role for actin nucleators in the formation of an invasive tumour microenvironment . Moreover , the frequency of ARP2 or ARP3 expression in these samples positively correlates with atypia and invasion depth of the tumour 57 . In addition , an association between increased expression of Arp2 / 3 complex subunit 1A ( ARPC1A ) and ARPC1B and a genomic amplification of the 7q21­q22 chromosomal region , which frequently occurs in pancre­ atic cancers , has recently been reported 58 . Accordingly , silencing of ARPC1A in pancreatic cancer cells contain­ ing 7q21­q22 amplification leads to a dramatic decrease in cell invasion 58 . An unexpected finding has come from the study of choroidal malignant melanoma cells , showing that high expression of ARPC1B correlates with resistance to radiotherapy 59 . The nature of this association remains unclear , but it might involve a novel role of ARPC1B in the regulation of cell cycle progression through an interaction with Aurora A kinase 60 . Nucleation - promoting factors . nPFs provide a major signalling input to the Arp2 / 3 complex 10 . Most nPFs contain the conserved wCA element ( TABLe 1 ) , which is sufficient to initiate Arp2 / 3­dependent actin nuclea­ tion in vitro ( FIG . 4 ) . Currently , eight wCA­containing nPFs have been identified in mammals 10 , and the most important nPFs are the ubiquitously expressed neural wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( n­wAsP ; encoded by WASL ) and the wAsP family verprolin homology proteins ( wAvE1 – 3 ; also known as wAsF1 – 3 ) . Another type of nPF is represented by cortactin , which was ini­ tially identified as a phosphorylation target of sRC 61 . As cortactin lacks the wCA domain ( TABLe 1 ) , it is by itself a weak activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex 10 . nucleation­ promoting activity of cortactin in vivo probably involves cooperation with n­wAsP 62 – 64 . Alternatively , cortactin might stabilize actin networks that are generated by the Arp2 / 3 complex 50 , 65 . n­wAsP and cortactin are essen­ tial for the formation of invadopodia 53 , 66 – 71 , whereas lamelli podia formation depends on wAvE2 ( ReF . 52 , 72 ) . Although neither n­wAsP nor cortactin is required for lamelli podia formation 53 , 72 , they both contribute to the sensing of chemotactic stimuli at the leading edge 66 . Moreover , cortactin controls lamellipodium persistence , and consequently overexpression of cortactin results in the increased migration and invasion of human fibrosarcoma cells 72 . Matrix remodelling is essential for mesenchymal invasion of cancer cells and there is good evidence that nPFs are critically involved in this process . Matrix degradation activity of invading cancer cells requires wAvE1 , wAvE3 and cortactin , which were shown to regulate the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) 53 , 67 , 73 – 75 . Interestingly , wAvE3­dependent MMP secretion is mediated by the tumorigenic MAPK path­ way 74 . Accordingly , downregulation of wAvE1 and wAvE3 expression strongly attenuates invasion of pros­ tate cancer cells 76 , 77 . Furthermore , depletion of wAvE3 was shown to suppress lung metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer 78 , and knock down of wAvE2 reduced the metastasis of melanoma cells 79 . These studies suggest that upregulation of nPFs can increase tumour invasion and metastatic spread in vivo . There are several reports that provide evidence for pathophysiological roles of nPFs in cancer progression in humans ( TABLe 2 ) . The coexpression of wAvE2 and ARP2 or ARP3 in cancer cells was identified as a risk factor for hepatic metastasis in colon carcinoma and as a negative prognostic factor in breast cancer 80 , 81 . Cells coexpressing wAvE2 and ARP2 or ARP3 are enriched at the invasive front of these tumours . Apart from cancer cells , high expression of wAvE2 or the Arp2 / 3 complex was also detected in tumour­associated macrophages 57 , 80 , 81 , again Figure 3 | actin nucleation factors in transcriptional regulation . Some actin nucleation factors act in both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear compartments . In the cytoplasmic compartment they mediate actin assembly , thereby controlling availability of G‑actin . G‑actin binds to the transcription factor MAL and inhibits its localization to the nucleus , as well as its cofactor activity 43 . N‑WASP can localize to the nucleus in a CDC42‑dependent manner 133 , and was shown to directly regulate RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) transcription by interaction with the PSF – NONO complex 105 . N‑WASP also mediates the association of hyaluronan receptor CD44 with ERBB2 and subsequent induction of β ‑catenin signalling 103 . JMY can either activate Arp2 / 3 or nucleate actin on its own . Upon DNA damage , JMY translocates to the nucleus where it regulates p53‑dependent transcription .

In this case , roundly shaped cells were found to be enriched in high histological grade breast carcinomas , suggesting that certain highly invasive cells use an amoeboid mode of invasion 81 . A comparative analysis of wAvE1 – 3 expression in breast tumours showed that there is a correlation between high expression levels and poorer prognosis for all three proteins , although only high levels of wAvE2 showed significant correlation 82 . Of note in this study , patients who had died from metastasis had higher expression levels of wAvE1 . Furthermore , hepatic metastases from patients with colorectal cancer show a strong increase in n­wAsP expression 83 , and increased n­wAsP expres­ sion has also been linked with lymph node metastasis in oesophageal carcinoma 84 . Cortactin . The gene for the nPF cortactin , CTTN , is located within the 11q13 region , which is frequently amplified in tumours 85 . Therefore , cortactin has been extensively studied in the context of tumour progres­ sion 86 , 87 . upregulation of cortactin was found to cor­ relate with invasion , metastasis and poor prognosis in various tumours ( TABLe 2 ) . strong cortactin expression is found in invasive head and neck squamous carcinomas ( HnsCCs ) but not in non­invasive , lymph node­negative tumours 85 , 88 . similarly , cortactin is enriched at the inva­ sive front of colorectal carcinoma and its lymphatic metastases 89 . Consistently , cortactin expression promotes invasion and metastasis in tumour mouse models 90 – 92 . sRC kinase­mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cort­ actin at residues 421 , 466 and 482 seems to be important for its pro­metastatic effect , as a non­phosphorylatable mutant that functions as a dominant­negative protein prevents the formation of bone metastases in mice with breast cancer 93 . In agreement with this idea , the dual sRC and ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor saracatinib reduces cortactin phosphorylation and invadopodia formation in vitro , as well as invasion and lymph node metastasis in a mouse model of HnsCC 94 . A recent retrospective clinical study showed that the number of patients with cortactin­positive HnsCC who died from their disease was not significantly different from the death rate in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ­positive and cortactin­positive HnsCC 88 . Interestingly , these data imply that patients with HnsCC overexpressing cortactin , as well as EGFR , may not respond to therapeutic strategies targeting EGFR only 88 . Consistent with this , in vitro experiments showed that the sensitivity of HnsCC cells to gefitinib , an EGFR inhibitor , is markedly reduced by cortactin overexpression 95 . One reason for this observation could be that cortactin was shown to prevent ligand­induced EGFR internalization 96 . Signalling properties of NPFs in metastasis . Besides their direct action on the cytoskeleton , nPFs are impor­ tant signalling molecules that operate at different lev­ els of intracellular signalling cascades to modulate the invasive behaviour of cancer cells . In several types of cancer cells wAvE2 was shown to function downstream of the small Rho­GTPase Rac to promote the mesenchymal mode of invasion through inhibition of actin – myosin contractility 97 , 98 , and n­wAsP was shown to promote amoeboid or rounded morphol­ ogy of melanoma cells through the RhoGEF DOCK10 and CDC42 activation 99 . Interestingly , downregulation of wAvE3 can result in mesenchymal to amoeboid tran­ sition 100 , and suppression of wAvE2 and n­wAsP may lead to increased activation of RHOA with subsequent overactivation of DIAPH1 ( ReF . 52 ) . Consistent with a counteractive role for wAvE2 on formins , the wAvE2 – Arp2 / 3 complex was demonstrated to bind and inhibit DIAPH3 ( ReF . 101 ) . Figure 4 | Scheme of arp2 / 3 complex interaction with an actin nucleus . The actin‑related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex is a seven subunit protein complex . The ARP2 and ARP3 subunits are structurally similar to actin and form the nucleation core to initiate the growth of a new actin filament . Actin nucleation activity by the Arp2 / 3 complex is intrinsically low and is activated by nucleation‑promoting factors ( NPFs ) such as WASP family verprolin homology proteins ( WAVE ) or neural Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( N‑WASP ) through the WCA domain , which binds to actin monomers as well as the Arp2 / 3 complex . Activation of Arp2 / 3 by an NPF results in the stabilization of the ARP2 and ARP3 subunits and the formation of a nucleation core . For simplicity binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex to F‑actin is not shown . R E V I E W S nATuRE REvIEws | CanCer vOLuME 11 | MARCH 2011 | 183 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved Although these findings indicate specific roles of nPFs in distinct modes of cancer cell migration , they also highlight a complex signalling crosstalk between different actin nucleating machineries that is likely to be variable among different types of cancer . Thus , signal­ ling interactions between formin and Arp2 / 3­dependent systems may provide cancer cells with the necessary plasticity during invasive migration through different environments and could therefore represent a consider­ able challenge in the development of successful therapies that target actin nucleation factors . To add further com­ plexity to this problem , some nPFs may also have func­ tions as tumour suppressors . For example , the wAvE complex component CYFIP1 ( also known as sRA1 ) was shown to act as a tumour suppressor by promoting the adhesion of breast cancer cells , and loss of CYFIP1 leads to the disruption of epithelial cell architecture and increased tumour invasion 102 . Furthermore , n­wAsP was implicated in the stimula­ tion of the oncogenic β­catenin signalling pathway 103 , 104 , and was shown to directly regulate transcription by interaction with the PsF – nOnO complex 105 . Thus , some actin nucleation factors seem to operate in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments , thereby link­ ing actin assembly and transcriptional activity ( FIG . 3 ) . However , whether and how these two processes are coordinated or distinctively controlled during cancer invasion remain to be unravelled . JMY Originally identified as a transcription cofactor involved in the p53 response , JMY can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm , were it functions as an Arp2 / 3 acti­ vator or as an intrinsic actin nucleator 106 ( FIG . 3 ) . when overexpressed or localized in the cytoplasm , JMY strongly facilitates cancer cell motility and invasion , and it seems likely that both its actin nucleating activity and its ability to negatively influence cadherin expression mediate this effect 107 . Thus , JMY is a dual function pro­ tein that may act as a tumour promoter in the cytoplasm or as a tumour suppressor in the stress­induced p53 tran­ scriptional response . Interestingly , JMY over expression in tumour stroma has been implicated in cancer pro­ gression , indicating that JMY­mediated signalling is a promising topic of cancer biology 108 . Ena / VASP proteins In mammals , the Ena / vAsP family 109 , 110 is represented by three ubiquitously expressed proteins — vAsP , mam­ malian Enabled ( MEnA ; also known as EnAH ) and Ena vAsP­like ( EvL ) . Ena / vAsP proteins localize at the lead­ ing edge where they support the polymerization of nucle­ ated actin filaments , function as anti­capping proteins 111 or markedly accelerate filament elongation 112 . In this way , Ena / vAsP proteins can assist the Arp2 / 3 complex 111 and collaborate with formins 113 . Ena / vAsP proteins are particularly important for the formation of filopodia 114 and actin assembly at cell – cell contacts 110 , 115 . However , in contrast to formins , Ena / vAsP proteins probably do not nucleate actin in vivo 116 , although Ena / vAsP­dependent actin nucleation in vitro has been reported 117 . The expression of MEnA and EvL is strongly increased in invasive tumour cells collected in vivo 55 , 56 . MEnA is known to exist in several splice variants ; one of which , MEnA11a , is found in poorly invasive breast cancer cell lines , whereas two others , MEnA + + and MEnA + + + are strongly upregulated in invasive cells 118 . MEnA + + and MEnA + + + are shown to promote cancer cell motility , invadopodia maturation and sensitivity to EGF and , more importantly , cancer invasion and metas­ tasis in vivo 119 . Although no data on tumour­specific expression of MEnA splice variants in humans have yet been provided , overexpression of total MEnA is observed in breast cancers and breast cancer metastases , as well as in colorectal cancer 120 , 121 ( TABLe 2 ) . There is some evidence for the role of two other mem­ bers of the Ena / vAsP family in cancer . Overexpression of EvL is shown to increase migration of MCF­7 cells in response to serum 122 , whereas migration of prostate cancer cells towards lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) seems to depend on the phosphorylation of vAsP by protein kinase A 123 . Conclusions and perspectives Enormous progress has been made in our understanding of actin assembly factors , their modes of action and their role in malignant disease . It seems to be only a matter of time before specific treatments using inhibition of actin regulators or nucleation factors will be added to antican­ cer drugs that target microtubule dynamics . In particu­ lar , the unsolved problem of invasive cell migration and metastasis is in great need of new concepts , and the large , and expanding , group of diverse and specialized actin nucleation factors seems promising for the future devel­ opment of compounds that might be suitable for clini­ cal applications . Indeed , it has been shown only recently that actin nucleation factors can be successfully targeted pharmacologically to inhibit distinct actin­dependent cell functions . Compounds that bind and block n­wAsP 124 have been identified , as have compounds that inhibit actin nucleation activity of Arp2 / 3 and the formation of pro­ trusive structures , such as podosomes in monocytes 125 . similarly , isoform­selective compounds that inhibit actin polymerization induced by DIAPH1 and DIAPH3 in vitro have been reported 126 . As a proof of principle , it was shown that small molecule­mediated suppression of formin 127 or Arp2 / 3 ( ReF . 128 ) activity can be used to inhibit cell motility . Furthermore , pharmacological inhibition of the actin bundling protein fascin 129 resulted in a strong reduction of metastatic spread in mice 130 , demonstrating the effective targeting of actin regula­ tory proteins for anticancer therapy . Certainly this is just the beginning , however , what will be needed are drugs that specifically modulate the activity of a single actin assembly factor in vivo . In addition , we still lack detailed information about the physiological expression of these proteins in human cells and tissues , not to mention in pathological situations , such as cancer and inflammation . Indeed , targeting actin nucleation factors might be useful to treat not only cancer cells but also other pro­invasive and pro­inflammatory cells such as tumour­associated macrophages or immune­modulating cells .
