Volume 26 November 5 , 2015 3999 MBoC | ARTICLE Physical limits on kinesin - 5 – mediated chromosome congression in the smallest mitotic spindles ABSTRACT A characteristic feature of mitotic spindles is the congression of chromosomes near the spindle equator , a process mediated by dynamic kinetochore microtubules . A ma - jor challenge is to understand how precise , submicrometer - scale control of kinetochore micro tubule dynamics is achieved in the smallest mitotic spindles , where the noisiness of microtubule assembly / disassembly will potentially act to overwhelm the spatial information that controls microtubule plus end – tip positioning to mediate congression . To better under - stand this fundamental limit , we conducted an integrated live fluorescence , electron micros - copy , and modeling analysis of the polymorphic fungal pathogen Candida albicans , which contains one of the smallest known mitotic spindles ( < 1 μm ) . Previously , ScCin8p ( kinesin - 5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) was shown to mediate chromosome congression by promot - ing catastrophe of long kinetochore microtubules ( kMTs ) . Using C . albicans yeast and hyphal kinesin - 5 ( Kip1p ) heterozygotes ( KIP1 / kip1 ∆ ) , we found that mutant spindles have longer kMTs than wild - type spindles , consistent with a less - organized spindle . By contrast , kine - sin - 8 heterozygous mutant ( KIP3 / kip3 ∆ ) spindles exhibited the same spindle organization as wild type . Of interest , spindle organization in the yeast and hyphal states was indistinguish - able , even though yeast and hyphal cell lengths differ by two - to fivefold , demonstrating that spindle length regulation and chromosome congression are intrinsic to the spindle and largely independent of cell size . Together these results are consistent with a kinesin - 5 – medi - ated , length - dependent depolymerase activity that organizes chromosomes at the spindle equator in C . albicans to overcome fundamental noisiness in microtubule self - assembly . More generally , we define a dimensionless number that sets a fundamental physical limit for maintaining congression in small spindles in the face of assembly noise and find that C . albicans operates very close to this limit , which may explain why it has the smallest known mitotic spindle that still manifests the classic congression architecture .

M . McCoy et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell arrival , promote catastrophe . Because long MTs have more binding sites for kinesin - 5 motors , they are more likely to accumulate motors at their plus ends and undergo catastrophe . Short MTs , however , provide fewer binding sites , making catastrophe less frequent and allowing the MTs to grow more efficiently . Because of its preferential accumulation at the growing tips of longer kMTs compared with shorter kMTs , kinesin - 5 in budding yeast is a length - dependent de - polymerase that provides a self - organizing mechanism to congress chromosomes even in the 1 - to 2 - μm budding yeast spindle . The role as a length - dependent depolymerase adds to the known role of kinesin - 5 in cross - linking antiparallel interpolar MTs and walking toward their plus ends to generate a force that slides them apart , thereby elongating and stabilizing the bipolar spindle ( Enos and Morris , 1990 ; Hagan and Yanagida , 1990 ; Cole et al . , 1994 ; Kashlna et al . , 1996 ; Hildebrandt and Hoyt , 2000 ; Kapitein et al . , 2005 ) . In addition , this new role is similar to the length - depen - dent depolymerase activity of the motor protein kinesin - 8 in yeast in vitro ( Gupta et al . , 2006 ; Varga et al . , 2006 ; Stumpff et al . , 2007 ) . However , Gardner et al . ( 2008 ) found that kinesin - 8 motors ( Kip3p in S . cerevisiae ) have no detectable effect on kMT length regulation in vivo ; instead , kinesin - 8 acts primarily on interpolar microtubules ( iMTs ) , implying that kinesin - 5 is primarily responsible for kMT length regulation in budding yeast . This differential effect of kinesin motors on the different types of spindle MTs is explained by the homotetra - meric structure of kinesin - 5 , which preferentially binds in areas of high polymer density , where both motor heads can bind simultane - ously . Accordingly , the lower polymer density of iMTs limits the abil - ity of kinesin - 5 to gain access to iMT plus ends . In contrast , the ho - modimeric structure of kinesin - 8 can only bind to a single MT at a time , allowing it relatively unimpeded access to the plus ends of long iMTs ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ) . Although the length - dependent depolymerase activity of kine - sin - 5 was detected in S . cerevisiae , it is not known whether this mechanism is generalizable to other organisms , particularly ones whose steady - state metaphase spindles are even shorter than in budding yeast—for example , < 1 μm . As spindles become shorter , their kinetochore microtubules , typically 35 – 45 % of spindle length , must also become proportionately shorter , making the require - ments for achieving congression even more demanding . In the limit , the length scales of the kMTs will start to approach the na - noscale of the tubulin dimers themselves ( 8 nm ) , so that stochastic growth and shortening dynamics , known as directional instability ( Inoue and Salmon , 1995 ) , will create sufficient “noise” to over - whelm the positioning signal located at the attractor zone as deter - mined by the motor - mediated catastrophe gradient . As illustrated in Figure 1 , the precision of congression can be quantified as the SD of kMT lengths , σ , which can in turn be normalized to the mean kMT length , < L > , to define the coefficient of variation , CV = σ / < L > . In engineering terms , noise in signals is often quantified as the signal - to - noise ratio , SNR , and in this case , SNR = < L > / σ = 1 / CV . In the case of no length control at all , the length distribution of microtu - bules will be exponential ( Hill and Chen , 1984 ) , in which case the mean equals the SD ( < L > = σ ) , and so CV = SNR = 1 . So , a funda - mental question in biology is , what sets the lower physical limit on absolute size of congressed mitotic spindles ? To address this question , we used the methods developed by Gardner et al . ( 2008 ) to study chromosome congression in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans , which has one of the smallest known eukaryotic mitotic spindles at ∼ 0 . 8 μm . C . albicans is a diploid yeast that has three distinct morphologies—budding yeast , pseudo - hyphae , and hyphae—with the multicellular hyphal morphology believed to be important for virulence ( Berman , 2006 ; Brand , 2012 ) . INTRODUCTION Mitosis , the phase of the cell cycle in which the replicated genome segregates to two daughter cells , requires the activity of dynamic microtubule plus ends that attach to chromosomes at kinetochores ( Inoué and Salmon , 1995 ) . Chromosome congression through the organization of dynamic kinetochore microtubules is widely ob - served and is necessary to establish an orderly preanaphase state . Several motor and kinetochore proteins are believed to drive con - gression , but the molecular mechanisms involved are not entirely clear ( Inoué and Salmon , 1995 ; Gardner et al . , 2008 ; Gatlin and Bloom , 2010 ; Kops et al . , 2010 ; Westhorpe and Straight , 2013 ) . The problem of spatial organization is especially acute in the smallest of eukaryotic spindles and raises the fundamental ques - tion of how spatial organization at the submicrometer scale is achieved in the face of stochastic microtubule length fluctuations . One of the smallest mitotic spindles is that of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which has metaphase spindle lengths of ∼ 1 . 2 – 2 . 0 μm and kinetochore microtubule lengths of ∼ 300 – 500 nm ( Winey et al . , 1995 ; Yeh et al . , 1995 ; Maddox et al . , 2000 ; Gardner et al . , 2005 , 2008 ; Shimogawa et al . , 2006 ; Tytell and Sorger , 2006 ) . During mitosis in budding yeast , each kinetochore attaches to the plus end of a single kinetochore microtubule ( kMT ; Winey et al . , 1995 ; O’Toole et al . , 1999 ; Joglekar et al . , 2006 , 2008 ) . The kMTs grow in a length - dependent manner by which short MTs grow effi - ciently by net tubulin subunit addition and long MTs tend to un - dergo net shortening near the equator by removing tubulin subunits at their plus ends ( Sprague et al . , 2003 ; Gardner et al . , 2005 ; Pearson et al . , 2006 ) . The consequence of length - dependent growth is that kMT plus ends cluster in “attractor zones” located between the spindle pole bodies ( SPBs ) and spindle equator . Because the kineto - chores are attached to the kMT plus ends , the chromosomes thus congress to the mitotic spindle equator . The result of the length - dependent growth appears as a characteristic bilobed distribution of fluorescent tubulin in budding yeast , in which the loss of fluores - cence near the spindle equator indicates the absence of tubulin and demonstrates that the kMT plus ends cluster at attractor zones lo - cated on opposite sides of the equator , typically near the quarter - spindle position ( Maddox et al . , 2000 ; Sprague et al . , 2003 ; Gardner et al . , 2005 , 2008 ) . A study of budding yeast by Gardner et al . ( 2008 ) found that de - letion of Cin8p , the major kinesin - 5 motor protein in S . cerevisiae , and to a lesser extent the minor kinesin - 5 Kip1p led to a phenotype that lacked the bilobed tubulin fluorescence distribution characteris - tic of wild - type metaphase spindles , indicating that the kMTs of the cin8 ∆ spindles were both longer and more variable in length than in the wild - type cells and suggesting that the chromosome alignment was subsequently disrupted . They also found that a cin8 ∆ mutant lacking the nuclear localization sequence also lacked spindle organi - zation and that cin8 mutants had longer astral MTs ( aMTs ) than the wild - type parental strain . Through this work and many other experi - ments , including electron microscopy to visualize the individual spin - dle MTs , fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of kinetochores and spindle MTs to determine where tubulin turnover is fastest , and fluorescent visualization of the Cin8p motors to determine their dy - namics and distribution on the spindles , Gardner et al . ( 2008 ) discov - ered that Cin8p is responsible for the length - dependent growth pat - tern of kMTs found experimentally in budding yeast . A model that explains these experimental observations proposes that kinesin - 5 motors act as length - dependent MT depolymerases , promoting ca - tastrophe ( the switch from a growing , polymerizing state to a short - ening , depolymerizing state ) of long MTs ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ) . In this model , kinesin - 5 motors walk toward MT plus ends and , upon Volume 26 November 5 , 2015 Limits on chromosome congression | 4001 RESULTS A dimensionless number that sets theoretical lower physical limits on congression To establish the lower limits on mitotic spin - dle congression , we developed a mathe - matical theory that predicts the CV , or equivalently the SNR ( Figure 1 ) , based on the assembly - disassembly dynamics of kMTs ( see the Supplemental Material ) . For small CV ( large SNR ) , a spindle will exhibit strict length control to achieve a well - organized congressed state while simultaneously re - maining dynamic and exhibiting directional instability . For animal spindles , we estimate values roughly ranging from < L > ≈ 8 . 3 μm and σ ≈ 1 . 35 μm for CV = 0 . 16 in a Potorous tridactylus PtK1 cell ( Cimini et al . , 2004 ) to < L > ≈ 3 . 1 μm and σ ≈ 0 . 56 μm for CV = 0 . 18 in a Drosophila melanogaster S2 cell ( see the Supplemental Material ) . Therefore it ap - pears that CV ≈ 0 . 15 – 0 . 20 ( SNR = 5 – 6 ) is characteristic of a well - organized , con - gressed state in an animal mitotic spindle . We wondered whether very small spindles , such as those in C . albicans , would theoreti - cally be able to achieve congression , and so we developed a mathematical model to predict the lower physical limits on congres - sion , that is , when CV = 1 . Our mathematical model , based on Figure 1 and detailed in the Supplemental Material , gives the CV in terms of a dimen - sionless Peclet number , Pe , given by V LD Pe = ( 1 ) where Pe characterizes the relative strength of convective trans - port ( V , the rate at which microtubules grow and shorten , i . e . , the velocity of directional instability ) relative to diffusive transport ( D , the rate at which random switching between growth and shorten - ing states acts to randomize the tip position ) , scaled by the size of the system ( < L > , the mean length of micro tubules ) . The Peclet number is commonly used to assess whether convection or diffu - sion is the dominant transport mechanism . In physical terms , a large Pe means that there is a very strong tendency for a kMT plus end to “drift” toward the attractor , whereas a low Pe means that kMT plus - end “diffusion” due to stochastic dynamic instability switching is dominant , disrupting the ability of the kMT plus end to be positioned near the attractor . As shown in the Supplemental Material , the CV is related to the Peclet number by C . albicans yeast cells morphologically resemble budding yeast cells ( Finley and Berman , 2005 ; Table 1 ) . In addition , C . albicans can be induced to form hyphae , which are much longer and narrower than yeast cells . In hyphae , before mitosis , nuclei migrate much larger distances than they do in yeast cells , and anaphase spindle lengths are also much longer in hyphae than in yeast cells ( Finley and Berman , 2005 ) . Thus C . albicans yeast cells are ideal for testing pre - dictions of the kinesin - 5 – mediated , self - organized model of chromo - some congression in a different organism , and C . albicans hyphal cells provide the opportunity to determine the effect of cell dimen - sions on mitotic spindle properties . Although some green algae and trypanosomes also have small spindles ( 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 μm ) , they lack suffi - cient numbers of microtubules to achieve a minimal 1 : 1 coupling of microtubules to chromosomes and thus likely operate by an alterna - tive mechanism relative to the more classic model for mitosis ( Gan et al . , 2011 ) . Thus C . albicans is an excellent model organism with which to explore classic mitosis at very small length scales . FIGURE 1 : Noise in chromosome congression . Schematic of kMT organization illustrating that kMTs need to have a relatively small SD of length ( σ ) relative to mean length ( < L > ) if they are to manifest a congressed state . The level of noise in chromosome congression can be quantified by the CV , which is the ratio of σ to < L > . Another common measure of noise in a signal is the SNR , which is the inverse of the CV . The level of noise in assembly physically originates from directional instability , the stochastic transitions between net kMT assembly ( away from poleward movement ) , and net kMT disassembly ( poleward movement ) due to net αβ - tubulin subunit addition / loss as kMTs undergo dynamic instability . < L > CV = L = 1 SNR - Length < L > Time “Direc(cid:25)onal Instability” A(cid:31)ractor Zone Net Assembly Net Assembly Net Disassembly kinetochore kinetochore microtubule sister chroma(cid:30)ds Note : interpolar microtubules not shown - + + A(cid:31)ractor Zone S . cerevisiae C . albicans Ploidy Haploid ( O’Toole et al . , 1999 ) Diploid ( Joglekar et al . , 2008 ) Kinesin - 5 motor proteins Cin8p , Kip1p ( Hildebrandt and Hoyt , 2000 ) Kip1p ( Chua et al . , 2007 ) Number of chromosomes 16 haploid ( O’Toole et al . 1999 ; Winey and O’Toole , 2001 ) 8 diploid ( 16 total ; Joglekar et al . , 2008 ) Number of kMTs / kinetochore 1 ( O’Toole et al . 1999 ; Winey and O’Toole , 2001 ) 1 ( Joglekar et al . , 2008 ; Burrack et al . , 2011 ) TABLE 1 : Selected comparison between S . cerevisiae and C . albicans . 4002 | K . M . McCoy et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell Using previous estimates for S . cerevisiae ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ; see Supplemental Table S3 ) , we estimate V = 1 . 2 μm / min , β = 28 μm − 1 min − 1 , < L > = 0 . 49 μm , and k c ( < L > ) = k r ( < L > ) = 14 min − 1 , and therefore τ = 0 . 053 min , which yields Pe = 11 or , equivalently , CV = 0 . 43 , in reasonable agreement with the direct experimental observations cited . For Cin8 Δ in S . cerevisiae , we estimate V = 1 . 9 μm / min , β = 17 μm − 1 min − 1 , < L > = 0 . 56 μm , k c ( < L > ) = k r ( < L > ) = 9 . 7 min − 1 , and therefore τ = 0 . 10 min , which yields Pe = 5 . 8 or , equivalently , CV = 0 . 59 , consistent with a more poorly congressed spindle . Be - cause the C . albicans spindle is even shorter than the S . cerevisiae spindle , the theory predicts that C . albicans is near the limits . To ad - dress this question and estimate CV for C . albicans , we conducted a quantitative analysis of the C . albicans spindle length and congres - sion in wild - type and reduced kinesin - 5 / kinesin - 8 motor levels . KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles are shorter on average than wild - type spindles To characterize quantitatively the mitotic spindle of C . albicans , we measured the metaphase spindle length as defined by the distance from minus end to minus end using green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) – tagged α - tubulin ( Figure 2 ) in both yeast and hyphal cells . Of L 2Pe σ = ( 2 ) In terms of microtubule assembly parameters , we can rewrite Eq . 2 as L V σ = βτ ( 3 ) where V is the velocity of directional instability ( V ≈ V g ≈ V s , where V g and V s are the kMT growth and shortening rates , respectively ) , β is the strength of the catastrophe gradient ( indicated by the green to red shading with increasing kMT length in Figure 1 ) , and τ is the mean time for switching between growth and shortening states ( τ ≈ 1 / k c ( < L > ) ≈ 1 / k r ( < L > ) , where k c ( < L > ) and k r ( < L > ) are the catastrophe and rescue frequencies when a kMT has length < L > , respectively ) . A detailed derivation is provided in the Supplemen - tal Material . In the present study , we consider that the gradient is mediated by molecular motors as previously described ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ) , although the analysis does not specifically require this assumption , and the gradient could principle be in mediated via a phosphostate gradient , for example ( Sprague et al . , 2003 ) FIGURE 2 : Spindle lengths in C . albicans .

Given the spindle - elongating sliding activity of kinesin - 5 in other species , reducing the amount of Kip1p on the spindle is expected to decrease the outward force on the SPBs , thus decreasing the spindle length . Consistent with this expectation , the mean length of the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ metaphase spindles was 766 ± 8 nm ( ± SEM ; n = 366 ) , which is statistically shorter than the wild - type ( WT ) spindle length of 842 ± 6 nm ( ± SEM ; n = 297 ; p < 0 . 0001 ; Student’s t test ) . These re - sults indicate that the reduction in the number of Kip1p motors de - creases the observed effects of the motors , as predicted , demon - strating that the spindle length is sensitive to the total number of motors present . Hyphal and yeast mitotic spindle length and shape are similar Of interest , hyphal metaphase spindles as measured from SPB to SPB followed the same pattern , with the mean KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindle length of 760 ± 19 nm ( ± SEM ; n = 54 ) being significantly shorter than the WT spindle length of 854 ± 19 nm ( ± SEM ; n = 65 ; p = 8 . 87 × 10 − 4 ; Student’s t test ) . Of importance , mean hyphal spindle lengths were not statistically different from the corresponding budding yeast spindles , with p = 0 . 54 for the WT spindles and 0 . 75 for the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles ( Student’s t test ) . The hyphal spindles also had the same spindle length distributions as the yeast spindles ( Figure 2 , C and D ) , confirming that the spindle length as measured from SPB to SPB is independent of cell morphology / morphogenetic stage . This result , combined with similar distribution patterns of Tub1 - GFP fluo - rescence ( Figure 3 , A , B , and E ) , demonstrates that there is no sig - nificant difference between the metaphase spindles of the budding yeast and hyphal cell morphologies , despite the hyphal cells being twofold to fivefold longer than yeast cells . We conclude that Kip1p effects on spindle shape and spindle length are robust with respect to local cell shape and size . In light of this result , all other experi - ments were performed using only cells with the budding yeast morphology . Tubulin - GFP fluorescence distribution is consistent with longer kMTs in KIP1 / kip1 ∆ cells than in wild - type cells If kinesin - 5 ( Kip1p in C . albicans ; Chua et al . , 2007 ) promotes kMT disassembly by a length - dependent mechanism ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ) , then the kMTs in the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles should be longer than the WT kMTs . Quantitative analysis of metaphase WT spin - dles revealed the characteristic bilobed distribution of tubulin fluorescence , with a decrease in fluorescence intensity near the spindle equator , indicating reduced amounts of microtubule den - sity at the equator ( Figure 3 , A and B ) . This suggests that , as in S . cerevisiae , kMT plus ends generally terminate before reaching the equator in C . albicans . To measure this effect , we analyzed metaphase spindles . Metaphase was defined using a length criterion by which all spindles within 1 SD of the average spindle length ( 842 ± 6 nm , n = 297 , error reported as SEM ) were considered to be in meta - phase ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ; Supplemental Figure S1 ) . Mutant spin - dles were analyzed using the wild - type length criterion to control for length - dependent effects . Quantitative analysis of the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles showed a statistically significant shift in fluores - cence toward the spindle equator , indicating that the kMTs extend through the spindle equator , where they contribute fluorescence FIGURE 3 : Kip1p deletion results in longer kMTs in C . albicans .

M . McCoy et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell well - congressed spindles compared with the spindles in KIP1 / kip1 ∆ heterozygotes . Indeed , the Tub1 - GFP fluorescence in KIP3 / kip3 ∆ spindles showed the same distribution as WT , with a characteristic decrease near the spindle equator , suggesting that kMT lengths in the KIP3 / kip3 ∆ spindles are , on average , the same as WT ( Figure 4B , n = 86 , p = 0 . 12 ) . This trend differs from that for the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles , which lack the decrease in fluorescence near the spindle equator ( Figure 2 , C and D ) , suggesting that the kMT lengths in the KIP3 / kip3 ∆ spindles are on average shorter than in the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ ( p < 0 . 0001 ) spindles ( Figure 4B ) . Nonetheless , the KIP3 / kip3 ∆ spin - dle lengths ( 961 ± 9 nm ; KIP3 / kip3 ∆ ± SEM ; n = 86 ) were longer than the WT spindle lengths ( 842 ± 6 nm ; WT ± SEM ; n = 297 ; p < 0 . 0001 ; Student’s t test ) , consistent with the proposed iMT depolymerase activity of Kip3p , which preferentially regulates iMT length ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ) . Our observation that the KIP3 / kip3 ∆ spindles exhibit the same level of kMT organization as WT , in that the spindles dis - play a decrease in Tub1 - GFP fluorescence at the spindle equator , suggests that Kip3p is not responsible for kMT length regulation during metaphase in C . albicans . signal , and their plus ends terminate at or past the equator ( Figure 3 , A and B ; p < 0 . 0001 ; bootstrap statistical method described in the Supplemental Material used unless otherwise noted ) . Electron tomography ( ET ) reconstruction of a KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindle confirmed that MTs in the mutant are longer than in the WT and that the mu - tant spindle is less organized overall ( Figure 3 , C and D ) . Together the fluorescence and electron microscopy measurements con - firmed the prediction that , as in S . cerevisiae , C . albicans cells with reduced levels of kinesin - 5 have longer kMTs and fail to properly organize spindle microtubules . Of interest , despite very different cell sizes , metaphase spindles of cells with the budding yeast mor - phology and the hyphal morphology yielded very similar results : KIP1 / kip1 ∆ kMTs were longer and more disorganized than WT spindles ( Figure 3E ) . KIP3 / kip3 ∆ kMTs display similar organization to WT kMTs The self - organized assembly model ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ) predicts that kinesin - 8 ( encoded by KIP3 in C . albicans ) primarily regulates the length of iMTs , and thus KIP3 / kip3 ∆ heterozygotes should have FIGURE 4 : Kip3p deletion does not result in longer kMTs in C . albicans yeast , but deletion of the Kip1p NLS results in longer kMTs .

Kip1p - GFP localizes to kinetochore microtubules in the spindle The length - dependent disassembly model in S . cerevisiae predicts that kinesin - 5 is associated with kMTs ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ) . In par - ticular , as motors attach to kMTs and move toward the kMT plus ends , their concentration should rise as they approach the kineto - chore , at which point they would promote catastrophe , leading to motor release back into the nucleoplasmic pool . Accordingly , C . albicans Kip1p / Kip1p - GFP cells have a bilobed distribution , con - sistent with its localization on kMTs ( Figure 6 ) . The Kip1p - GFP distri - bution was shifted toward the SPB relative to the kinetochore marker Cse4 - GFP ( Figure 6C ) . This is explained in the self - organized model by dissociation of motors from kMT plus ends that shorten past the position of the motors . Kip3p - GFP localizes to the spindle equator In contrast to kinesin - 5 , which is predicted to act preferentially on kMTs due to its tetrameric structure , kinesin - 8 homodimers are pre - dicted to preferentially localize to and act on iMTs due to the larger number of binding positions on longer MTs . Most of the Kip3p mo - tors should be found near the iMT plus ends because they are plus end – directed , processive motors ( Gupta et al . , 2006 ; Varga et al . , 2006 ) . Because iMTs are generally longer than kMTs , the model KIP1 / kip1 ( NLS ∆ ) spindles phenocopy KIP1 / kip1 ∆ Tub1 - GFP distribution The length - dependent disassembly model for kinesin - 5 predicts that the net depolymerase effect of Kip1p is directly dependent on the number of motors on the spindle itself rather than indirectly through the total number of motors in the cell . Therefore deleting the nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) of one copy of Kip1p , which presumably would restrict half of the available Kip1p from entering the nucleus , is predicted to result in longer , less - organized kMTs , similar to those seen in the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ heterozygous mutant . Con - sistent with this prediction and with experimental results for the analogous kinesin - 5 NLS deletion mutants in S . cerevisiae ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ) , spindles in C . albicans KIP1 / kip1 ( NLS ∆ ) cells exhibited a Tub1 - GFP fluorescence intensity distribution similar to that of spin - dles in the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ cells : the relative fluorescence intensity near the spindle equator was higher than in the WT cells ( p = 0 . 0002 ; Figure 4 , C and D ) . In addition , the KIP1 / kip1 ( NLS ∆ ) spindles also were observed to be shorter than WT spindles ( 812 ± 8 nm ; KIP1 / kip1 ( NLS ∆ ) ± SEM ; p = 0 . 008 ; Student’s t test ) but longer than KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles ( p < 1 × 10 − 4 ; Student’s t test ) . This is likely due to the partitioning of half of the Kip1p motors outside of the nucleus during mitosis , because C . albicans , like S . cerevisiae , undergoes a closed mitosis in which the nuclear envelope does not break down ( Berman , 2006 ) . Because some of the motors cannot access the spindle during mitosis , they cannot affect spindle organization . This result confirms that it is the number of motors in the nucleus , and thus on the mitotic spindle , that affects kMT length and organization rather than the global number of motors present in the cell . Astral MT length depends on concentration of motors in the cytosol Deleting the NLS presumably increases the concentration of motors outside of the nucleus and , thus , according to the length - depen - dent disassembly model of kinesin - 5 , should decrease the average aMT length as a function of the concentration of motors outside of the nucleus . Consistent with this , the aMTs of the KIP1 / kip1 ( NLS ∆ ) spindles were shorter ( 850 ± 70 nm [ ± SEM ] ; n = 87 ) than the WT aMTs ( p = 9 × 10 − 5 ; Student’s t test ; Figure 5 ) . By this same logic , reducing the overall number of motors should also increase the aMT length . This effect was seen in the aMTs in the cytosol of the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ cells , which were longer ( 1800 ± 130 nm [ ± SEM ] ; n = 44 ) than the WT aMTs ( 1300 ± 90 nm [ ± SEM ] ; n = 54 ; p = 0 . 001 ; Student’s t test ; Figure 5A ) . The role of kinesin - 8 in aMT length is to depolymerize aMTs , and , thus , reducing the total amount of Kip3p by 50 % in KIP3 / kip3 ∆ strains is expected to reduce the number of depolymerases and in - crease aMT length ( Gupta et al . , 2006 ; Varga et al . , 2006 ) . Consis - tent with this prediction , the aMTs of KIP3 / kip3 ∆ spindles were lon - ger ( 2400 ± 120 nm [ ± SEM ] ; n = 79 ) than WT aMTs ( p = 6 × 10 − 10 ; Student’s t test ) , as expected based on the Kip3p depolymerase activity . This significant increase in the aMT length compared with the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ cells is consistent with the model’s prediction that the Kip3p dimers are more likely to bind to MTs without nearby MTs to cross - link , such as aMTs , than the Kip1p tetramers , which prefer - entially bind to kMTs due to the increased cross - linking potential . Taken together , these results demonstrate that Kip1p promotes net shortening of aMTs as a function of motor concentration , which is consistent with the model of Kip1p as a promoter of MT disassembly that acts preferentially on kMTs over iMTs in the nu - cleus and that also acts on aMTs in the cytoplasm . In addition , Kip3p also acts as a depolymerase , although its activity is prefer - entially directed toward aMTs and iMTs rather than kMTs , which is FIGURE 5 : Kip1p and Kip3p promote aMT shortening in C . albicans yeast .

Molecular Biology of the Cell ( ∼ 1 . 5 μm ; Gardner et al . , 2005 ; Straight et al . , 1998 ) vs . ∼ 0 . 84 μm ( this study ) , and the kMT plus - end distribution is shifted poleward in budding yeast relative to C . albicans , suggesting that the kMTs are slightly shorter relative to the spindle length in budding yeast ( see Figure 2A in Gardner et al . , 2008 ) . S . cerevisiae has two functionally redundant kinesin - 5 motors ( Cin8p and Kip1p ) , and Cin8p appears to be more important than ScKip1p in mitosis , as cin8 ∆ mitotic phenotypes are more severe than kip1 ∆ phenotypes , and S . cerevi - siae CIN8 kip1 ∆ spindle lengths were more similar to WT than were cin8 ∆ KIP1 spindle lengths ( Hoyt et al . , 1992 ; Roof et al . , 1992 ; Saunders et al . , 1997 ; Hildebrandt and Hoyt , 2000 ; Tytell and Sorger , 2006 ; Gardner et al . , 2008 ) . As indicated by its name , Kip1p is the only kinesin - 5 homologue in C . albicans , and it is more similar to ScKip1 than to ScCin8p . We reasoned that the differences in the budding yeast and C . albicans spindles might be due to C . albicans having two copies of Kip1 rather than single copies of both Kip1 and Cin8 ( Chua et al . , 2007 ) . If ScCin8p is an intrinsically more effective length - dependent de - polymerase than ScKip1p , then the self - organized model would predict that cells containing only Kip1p would have shorter spindles with longer kMTs relative to the spindle length than cells containing both Cin8p and Kip1p in equivalent amounts . To test this , we reen - gineered ScCin8 for C . albicans codon usage and constructed a strain heterozygous for CaKip1 and containing a copy of ScCin8 under native promoters ( KIP1 / kip1 ∆ + CIN8 ) . The S . cerevisiae kinesin - 5 motor Cin8p rescued the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ phenotype in C . albicans , showing a clear bilobed Tub1 - GFP fluo - rescence distribution characteristic of WT metaphase spindles ( Figure 7 ) . This demonstrates that , when expressed from a native C . albicans promoter , ScCin8p is not functionally different from CaKip1p and that these highly conserved motors have functionality beyond their species of origin . Furthermore , spindle length of the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ + CIN8 strain was indistinguishable from that of WT spindles ( 820 ± 10 nm [ ± SEM ] ; p = 0 . 15 ; Student’s t test ) , which is significantly longer than the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindle length ( p < 0 . 0001 ; Student’s t test ) . Thus the presence of ScCin8p in S . cerevisiae is not sufficient to explain the differences between the metaphase spindle lengths of S . cerevisiae and C . albicans . This is consistent with spindle length being determined largely by iMTs rather than by kMTs and thus largely under the control of Kip3p and not Kip1p and / or Cin8p . The KIP1 / kip1 ∆ + CIN8 spindles had a Tub1 - GFP fluorescence intensity distribution that is qualitatively similar , al - though not identical , to WT ( p = 7 × 10 − 4 ) and different from the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ distribution ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . We conclude that ScCin8 can replace Kip1 for establishing the bilobed spindle structure charac - teristic of wild - type cells and , to a large degree , for spindle length . KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles have longer MTs than WT as measured from electron tomography reconstructions To assess whether the spindle ultrastructure in C . albicans is similar to that previously observed in S . cerevisiae ( Winey et al . , 1995 ; O’Toole et al . , 1999 ) , we performed ET reconstructions of WT and KIP1 / kip1 spindles . ET reconstruction of two WT and three KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles allowed the individual MTs in each spindle to be visualized ( Figure 8A ) . The MTs in the WT spindles were on aver - age shorter relative to the spindle length ( 230 ± 26 nm , which rep - resents 20 ± 2 % of the spindle length ) than those of the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles ( 292 ± 22 nm ; 40 ± 3 % ; p = 0 . 011 ; chi - squared test ; Figure 8B and Table 2 ) . The KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles also had more MTs that were > 50 % of the total spindle length ( 34 . 4 % of all MTs , n = 122 ) than the WT spindles ( 19 . 8 % of all MTs , n = 91 ; p = 0 . 028 ; chi - squared test ) . As with S . cerevisiae , the chromosomes do not FIGURE 6 : Kip1p motors localize to kMTs proximal to kinetochores , and Kip3p motors localize to the spindle equator , in C . albicans yeast .

Indeed , on metaphase spindles , WT Kip3p - GFP did not show the bilobed distribution seen for Kip1p - GFP , and instead Kip3p - GFP localized to the spindle equator during metaphase ( Figure 6 , B and C ) . This suggests that the di - meric Kip3p motors localize to the iMTs and is consistent with the model prediction that the kinesin - 8 dimeric motors will preferen - tially bind to iMTs and tetrameric motors will bind to the kMTs ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ) . Accordingly , KIP3 / kip3 ∆ spindles also were not obviously disorganized , and the observed motor distribution suggests that Kip3p did not have a significant effect on kMT length regulation . It follows that the in vitro depolymerase activity ob - served for Kip3p ( Varga et al . , 2006 ) may be helping to regulate iMT length , which would account for the increased spindle length in the KIP3 / kip3 ∆ spindles ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) . Furthermore , the re - duced amounts of Kip3p will result in longer iMTs , which provide more MT overlap for Kip1p to cross - link and slide the SPBs apart . S . cerevisiae Cin8p rescues C . albicans KIP1 / kip1 ∆ phenotype Although the mitotic mechanisms of S . cerevisiae and C . albicans are similar , there are several important differences between their re - spective spindle structures .

M . McCoy et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell against those previously described ( Figure 9 , A and B ) . The simula - tion parameters were then adjusted to fit the observed C . albicans spindle length and distribution ( all simulation parameters are listed in Supplemental Table S3 ) . The intersection of the catastrophe and rescue frequencies forms attractor zones of kinetochore microtubule plus ends , where microtubules have a zero net growth rate ( V g = 0 ) . With a strong catastrophe gradient due to a large number of kine - sin - 5 motors , the attractor zone is located approximately midway between the spindle pole and spindle equator ( Figure 9 , catastro - phe and rescue frequencies ) . As expected , the plus ends of kineto - chore microtubules cluster at these locations on both sides of the spindle equator ( Figure 9 , histograms ) . Reducing the number of mo - tors leads to a weaker catastrophe gradient , pushing the attractor zone closer to the equator . This results in kinetochore microtubules that are both longer and more variable in length . These results are consistent with both S . cerevisiae WT ( more motors ) and cin8 Δ ( re - duced motors ) and C . albicans WT ( more motors ) and KIP1 / kip1 Δ ( reduced motors ) , despite the difference in spindle lengths between the two organisms . In both cases , by changing only the number of motors , the model demonstrates that kMT plus ends fail to congress properly due to a decrease in catastrophe frequency ( Figure 9 ) . Thus the lack of kinesin - 5 motors is sufficient to explain the observed spindle organization using the motor - dependent catastrophe model . Estimation of CV for congression in the C . albicans mitotic spindle From the simulation parameters , we can estimate the coefficient of variation of kMT lengths in the C . albicans spindle , which was pre - dicted to be > 0 . 43 , based on the comparison to S . cerevisiae de - scribed earlier . Because the experimental data for WT shown earlier exhibit the hallmarks of a congressed spindle , the CV should be < 1 . 0 , which is the value obtained for random positioning of kineto - chores within the spindle . Using the C . albicans WT parameter values in Supplemental Table S3 , we estimate V = 1 . 2 μm / min and β = 20 μm − 1 min − 1 . On the basis of the tubulin fluorescence dis - tribution , we can estimate the mean kMT length by the position at which the decrease of fluorescence is steepest , ∼ 0 . 4 , which , when multiplied by the spindle length , 840 nm , gives < L > = ( 0 . 4 ) ( 840 nm ) = 336 nm . At this length , k c = k r = 8 . 7 min − 1 for τ = 0 . 11 min ( 6 . 9 s ) . Putting these values together , we obtain , via Eq . S31 in the Supple - mental Material , Pe = 4 . 9 . From Eq . 2 , the CV is estimated to be L 24 . 9 0 . 64 σ = = ( 4 ) or , equivalently , SNR = 1 . 56 . Thus we estimate the SD of kMT lengths to be σ = ( 0 . 64 ) ( 336 nm ) = 215 nm . For the C . albicans KIP1 / kip1 ∆ , we estimate , using the same approach , that Pe = 4 . 8 , which condense to a structure that can be visualized in the electron mi - croscope ( EM ) to identify which MT is a kMT . However , the EM re - constructions show that there are sufficient numbers of MTs for 1 MT / kinetochore , so the majority of MTs are likely kMTs , whereas a relatively small fraction ( ∼ 10 % ) are iMTs . Assuming that both the WT and KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles have the same number of iMTs , this suggests that more MTs cross the spindle equator in the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles , which is consistent with the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spin - dles having longer and less organized MTs than WT , as is predicted by the self - organized assembly model . Assuming that there are four iMTs / spindle during metaphase ( two per SPB ) and 1 kMT / chromatid ( 32 total kMTs ; Joglekar et al . 2008 ) , we see that the kMT length distributions of the EM spindles were generated by removing the four longest MTs and then remov - ing the shortest MTs until there were 32 MTs left ( Figure 8C ) . Even in the absence of the longest MTs , the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles have lon - ger kMTs and more kMTs that cross the spindle equator ( > 50 % of the spindle length ) than the WT spindles . This is in direct agreement with the Cse4 - GFP fluorescence data , which show that in WT cells , the kinetochores are clustered around the spindle equator , suggest - ing that only a small number of kMTs cross the spindle equator . This is also in agreement with the Tub1 - GFP fluorescence data , which show an increase in fluorescence intensity at the spindle equator in the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles relative to the WT spindles and is consistent with the self - organized assembly model . These EM results support our findings obtained by fluorescence microscopy that deletion of one copy of Kip1p leads to longer kMTs and thus less - organized spindles than in WT . However , due to very small sample sizes and spindle - to - spindle variability , it is difficult to draw specific conclusions about kMT length and spindle organiza - tion from the EM data alone . Nevertheless , the EM provides inde - pendent experimental confirmation of the basic structure of the spindle and lengths of MTs inferred from fluorescence microscopy . Simulating CaKip1 - mediated , length - dependent kMT assembly dynamics Computational modeling of the length - dependent disassembly model of kinesin - 5 allowed the model to be explicitly tested against the experimental data for C . albicans . In the Monte Carlo simulation ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ) , kMT and iMT dynamics could be tracked as kinesin - 5 motors progressed along their lengths toward MT plus ends and promoted catastrophe when they reached them . The computer simulation of the kMT dynamics in C . albicans is based on the previously described tension - dependent rescue model ( Sprague et al . , 2003 ) and the motor - dependent catastrophe model ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ) .

When CV = 1 , this inverse relationship predicts a minimum spindle length of 404 nm ( equivalent to ∼ 50 αβ - tubulin dimer lengths ) . The smallest known eukaryote , O . tauri , has a spindle length of ∼ 0 . 5 μm ( Gan et al . , 2011 ) but lacks sufficient numbers of microtubules to achieve the minimal 1 : 1 coupling of kinetochores to microtubules , as illustrated in Figure 1 . Mutations in kinesin - 5 in both S . cerevisiae ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ) and C . albicans ( this study ) are sufficient to increase CV with modest decrease in SL , meaning that kinesin - 5 mediates congression in both yeast organisms . Animal spindles have a CV that is only weakly dependent on spindle length and may plateau , ∼ CV = 0 . 15 . Data for C . albicans and S2 cells are from the present study , data for S . cerevisiae are from Gardner et al . ( 2008 ) , and data for PtK1 cells are from Cimini et al . ( 2004 ) . yields CV = 0 . 65 and SNR = 1 . 55 , with < L > = 383 nm and σ = 247 nm . Thus the kinetochores are less congressed due to kMTs being lon - ger and more variable in length than WT . DISCUSSION Collectively our results demonstrate that precise , submicrometer control of kMT lengths and chromosome congression is achieved in C . albicans , whose mitotic spindle is among the smallest of known eukaryotic spindles ( measured here as ∼ 840 nm ) . Similar - sized and smaller spindles exist among the eukaryotes , including green algae ( 600 – 800 nm ; Gan et al . , 2011 ; Supplemental Figures S3 and S4 ) . However , these microorganisms lack sufficient numbers of microtu - bules to achieve a minimal 1 : 1 coupling of microtubules to chromo - somes and so likely segregate chromosomes by an alternative , un - known mechanism . By contrast , based on our analysis , C . albicans has sufficient numbers of microtubules to achieve a minimal 1 : 1 cou - pling of kMTs to kinetochores . Thus our results show that despite the myriad of putative exotic mitotic mechanisms among phylogeny ( Drechsler and McAinsh , 2012 ) , a submicrometer - length mitotic spindle can exhibit the “classic” congressed spindle organization commonly associated with larger spindles . From our analysis , we can now establish a simple scaling relation - ship that defines the CV as function of spindle length . As shown in Figure 10 , using the foregoing calculated numbers , we find that the CV increases with decreasing spindle length . By empirically fitting a power - law relationship using the two shortest spindles ( S . cerevisiae and C . albicans ) given by a CV SL b = ⋅ ( 5 ) where SL is the spindle length ( in micrometers ) , we estimate a = 0 . 57 and b = − 0 . 61 . As shown in Figure 10 , this means that the data re - veal a nearly inverse square - root relationship between CV and SL . The relationship allows us to estimate the lower bound for “classic” eukaryotic spindle length by substituting CV = 1 into Eq . 5 , and we obtain SL CV 1 0 . 4 m ( ) = = µ ( 6 ) Assuming that αβ - tubulin heterodimers , the fundamental sub - units that self - assemble to form microtubules , are 8 nm in length , we find that the lower bound corresponds to 50 dimer layers . For a spindle at the lower limit , where CV = 1 , this means an average kMT length of at most half this length , 0 . 20 μm , or 25 dimer layers . In this limit , kinetochores would be nearly uniformly distributed along the spindle axis , with no semblance of congression . It is interesting to note that , to our knowledge , there are no spindles shorter than this lower limit . The only known spindle shorter than that of C . albicans is possibly that of the unicellular green algae Ostreococcus tauri , the smallest known eukaryote , which appears to have a spindle length of ∼ 0 . 5 μm ( Gan et al . , 2011 ) . However , the O . tauri spindle lacks sufficient numbers of microtubules to match the numbers of chro - mosomes and so is believed to not conform to the classic spindle structure ( Gan et al . , 2011 ) . We speculate that even above the lower limit ( e . g . , ∼ 0 . 5 μm for O . tauri ) , congression would be difficult to achieve , and so alternative strategies may be required to achieve high - fidelity genome segregation . In general , organisms such as O . tauri and C . albicans challenge the fundamental lower limits of spindle organization in the context of nanometer - scale microtubule assembly “noise , ” whereas typical animal spindle lengths are ∼ 10 μm and can be as large as 60 μm ( Goshima and Scholey , 2010 ) . It appears that C . albicans has the smallest known spindle that main - tains sufficient MT numbers to achieve at least 1 : 1 coupling to ki - netochores and that spatial control of kMT length on the nanoscale necessary for congression is largely ensured by the kinesin - 5 , Kip1p , rather than the kinesin - 8 , Kip3p . Our results are consistent with a mechanism by which kinesin - 5 regulates chromosome congression via length - dependent depoly - merase activity in C . albicans , consistent with the Gardner et al . ( 2008 ) self - organized model of kMT length regulation in budding yeast . Longer kMTs are more likely to undergo net shortening , most likely through catastrophe , due to the increased number of kinesin - 5 motors that can bind to them , thus suppressing net kMT assembly when the kMT plus ends are near the equator , and centering the plus - end associated chromosomes near the spindle equator . In cells lacking kinesin - 5 in the nucleus ( KIP1 / kip1 ∆ and KIP1 / kip1 ( NLS ∆ ) ) , the spindles do not display the same level of kMT organization as the WT cells . EM reconstructions of both WT and KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spin - dles confirm the longer and more disorganized kMTs in the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ spindles inferred from the fluorescence microscopy images of Tub1 - GFP . The net longer and more variable - length kMTs suggest that the chromosomes are not properly congressed at the spindle equator during metaphase in mutant cells . Note that the EM data cannot unambiguously discriminate between kMTs and iMTs ; how - ever , based on Joglekar et al . ’s ( 2008 ) estimate of 2 iMTs / SPB and 1 kMT / kinetochore , the majority of the ∼ 45 MTs / spindle observed ( Table 2 ) must be kMTs . This means that with the elimination of Volume 26 November 5 , 2015 Limits on chromosome congression | 4011 mitosis might be less tightly regulated in these pathogenic fungi than in S . cerevisiae ( Selmecki et al . , 2006 , 2010 ; Harrison et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , specific aneuploidies can confer resistance to antifungal drugs through altered gene copy numbers present in an - euploidy cells . Our experimental results demonstrate that Kip1 , but not Kip3 , plays a crucial role in kMT length regulation , which subse - quently affects chromosome congression in metaphase . Without proper congression , mitotic errors leading to aneuploidy are more likely . Altering the activity of Kip1p might serve as a way to control the degree to which aneuploidy arises and determine whether anti - fungal resistance results . In addition , the chromosome congression model can be used to predict in silico the parameters that are most and least likely to result in a disorganized spindle leading to aneu - ploidy and to map target molecules to model parameters . Thus an interesting alternative approach to targeting antifungal resistance is to focus on fungal - specific aspects of mitosis as potential targets for new therapeutic antifungal strategies . MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast strains and cell cultures All strain descriptions are given in Table 3 , all oligonucleotides are listed in Supplemental Table S1 , and all primers used are listed in Supplemental Table S2 . Cells were cultured on solid synthetic de - fined yeast culture ( SDC ) medium on 1 % agar plates and incubated at 30°C . Cells were prepared for imaging in 2 % glucose liquid SDC medium and incubated in an orbital shaker for ∼ 2 h at 30°C / 225 rpm extreme lengths ( ∼ 4 longest and 8 or 9 shortest MTs ) , we are left with what are primarily kMTs . In S . cerevisiae , kinesin - 5 cross - links antiparallel iMTs and provides a force that pushes the spindle pole bodies apart , thus elongating the spindle , an effect that is seen in the shortening of spindles lacking kinesin - 5 ( KIP1 / kip1 ∆ and KIP1 / kip1 ( NLS ∆ ) ) and that is particularly important during anaphase . However , the Kip1p - GFP results show that during metaphase , the majority of Kip1p is segregated on either side of the spindle equator , meaning that most kinesin - 5 is associated with the kMTs , because iMT - associated Kip1p would be apparent near the spindle equator due to the lon - ger length of iMTs . The close correspondence between the kineto - chore distribution and the Kip1p distribution suggests that kinesin - 5 directly regulates the kMT length distribution by acting at the kMT plus ends . The presence of a yeast kinesin - 5 in the C . albicans nu - cleus during mitosis is sufficient to organize the spindle , regardless of the specific kinesin - 5 and its yeast species of origin . The aMT length is dependent on the concentration of Kip1p in the cytosol , further demonstrating that Kip1p has strong depolymerase activity on kMTs and aMTs . Although this study does not elucidate the mechanism by which kinesin - 5 acts as a depolymerase , the most likely mechanism is through direct interaction with the MT plus ends , possibly through disruption of the crystal lattice or GTP cap . Another possible mecha - nism is that kinesin - 5 motors transport a protein responsible for de - polymerization to the plus ends . Although kinesin - 5 motors are not known to transport cargoes , in budding yeast , the molecular chap - erone Sse1 helps to symmetrically distribute Cin8p throughout the spindle , although how this is mechanistically involved with the de - polymerase activity of Cin8p is unknown ( Makhnevych and Houry , 2013 ) . Similarly , the human kinesin - 5 , Eg5 , has been shown to di - rectly interact with EB1 , the MT tip – tracking protein , which raises the possibility that such interactions may play a role in kinesin - 5 plus - end activity in higher eukaryotes ( Jiang et al . , 2012 ) . The extent to which this mechanism is generalized is also unknown , as it has been shown in both budding yeast and C . albicans , but it has yet to be demonstrated outside of yeast . The greater number of motors associated with animal spindles may lead to a breakdown of the mechanism or a distribution of the plus - end disassembly activity of yeast kinesin - 5 across several motors . The similarity of the spindles in the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ + CIN8 back - ground and WT suggests that yeast kinesin - 5 motors can function outside of their unique biochemical and species - specific context . Kinesins are highly conserved across species , but this shows that they can function in other species under native promoters , suggest - ing that their function does not depend on unique biochemical pathways or signaling . This result also demonstrates that there is no functional difference between ScCin8p and CaKip1p , and the pres - ence of Cin8p in S . cerevisiae and not C . albicans by itself is not sufficient to explain the differences in the spindle length between those two species . In addition , we found that the cell size ( yeast vs . hyphal ) did not affect spindle size or organization , demonstrating a breakdown of the proposed cell size / spindle size scaling for small cells based on analysis of Xenopus laevis cell and spindle size ( Mitchison et al . , 2012 ) . The shorter spindles present in C . albicans are not due to its only having Kip1p , and the origin of that difference is unknown , but it might be due to different kinesin - 5 levels in the cell under native promoters or a smaller number of iMTs affecting the force balance of the spindle , or possibly higher levels of tubulin expression in S . cerevisiae than in C . albicans . Finally , C . albicans and several related yeasts are often aneuploid ( carry extra copies of one to a few chromosomes ) , suggesting that Strain number Genotype Source RM1000 ura3 : : imm434 / ura3 : : imm434 iro1 / iro1 : : imm434 his1 : : hisG / his1 : : hisG Alonso - Monge et al .

Transformants were selected on SDC - His and confirmed by PCR amplification of a 1 . 6 - kbp product with primers 565 and 4370 and a WT allele with primers 5033 and 4371 . YJB13209 was con - structed by transforming YJB12859 with the 3 . 2 - kbp PCR product amplified from pMG1602 and primers 6158 and 6159 . Transfor - mants were selected on SDC - Ura and confirmed by PCR amplifica - tion of a 450 – base pair product with primers 725 and 6045 . Fluorescence imaging All live - cell fluorescence images were collected on a Nikon ( Melville , NY ) TE200 inverted microscope with a 60 × , 1 . 49 numerical aperture ( NA ) Plan Apo objective with a 2 . 5 × projection lens , illuminated with the 89 North PhotoFluor II light source , and detected with an EGFP / mCherry ET ( 59022 ; Chroma Technology , Bellows Falls , VT ) filter set . The images were collected on a 1390 z 1040 14 - bit CoolSnap HQ 2 charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera with ∼ 60 % quantum efficiency ( Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) . One hundred percent illumination from the light source was used , and the exposure times varied from 100 to 500 ms for GFP and 100 to 800 ms for mCherry , depending on the experiment , controlled via a shutter ( Uniblitz , Rochester , NY ) . All im - ages collected were single plane and at a single time point . The imag - ing system was controlled by MetaMorph software ( Molecular De - vices , Sunnyvale , CA ) , and the cells were incubated on the stage at room temperature . Electron tomography Cells were prepared for electron microscopy using high - pressure freezing and freezing substitution as essentially described in Winey et al . ( 1995 ) . Dual - axis tilt series acquisition was carried out using a Tecnai TF30 ( FEI , Hillsboro , OR ) operating at 300 kV ( O’Toole et al . , 2002 ) . Tomographic reconstruction and modeling of spindle MTs was performed using the IMOD software package ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) . The lengths of spindle MTs were measured from the model contour data using the program IMODINFO within the IMOD package . Image analysis Mitotic spindles were determined to be in metaphase based on a length criterion . Once the spindles form , the cell remains in a meta - phase steady state for ∼ 60 min ( Supplemental Figure S1B ) until the spindle rapidly elongates during anaphase ( Yeh et al . , 1995 ; Burke and Stukenberg , 2008 ) . It was assumed that the majority of visible spindles would be in metaphase for this reason , so the metaphase length ( as measured from SPB to SPB ) was determined by taking the mean length of all spindles . Metaphase spindles were defined as spindles that were within 1 SD of the mean . Cells that fell outside this criterion were assumed to likely either be in prometaphase if they were too short or anaphase if they were too long . The collected images were analyzed using a MATLAB ( Math - Works , Natick , MA ) script that calculated the average fluorescence distribution over the normalized half - spindle . The MT minus ends were located using the Gaussian survival function method in the tip - tracking code as previously described ( Demchouk et al . , 2011 ) , and line scans were taken along the length of the rotated spindle to determine the average fluorescence intensity at each point along the spindle , which was then normalized to 0 . 5 for the half - spindle . The astral microtubule lengths were calculated by manually select - ing the location of the plus and minus ends in the image and calcu - lating the distance between the two points . Simulation methods Monte Carlo simulations were run using MATLAB based on methods described previously ( Sprague et al . , 2003 ; Gardner et al . , 2005 , for the budding yeast morphology experiments and 37°C / 225 rpm for hyphae experiments . For hyphae experiments , before incuba - tion in the shaker , the cells were incubated at 30°C in 2 % glucose SDC medium overnight and then diluted 1 : 50 in SDC medium containing 10 % adult bovine serum and 2 % glucose . For imaging , 10 μl of cell suspension was plated on a polyethylenimine - coated , 35 - mm dish with a round , 14 - mm , no . 1 . 5 coverglass bottom ( P35G - 1 . 5 - 14 - C ; MatTek , Ashland , MA ) , allowed to adhere to the dish for 10 min , and covered with polydimethylsiloxane oil to limit dehydration . Strain construction Strain YJB12377 was constructed by transforming YJB8599 with a PCR product amplified from pMG2343 ( pMcherry - NAT ) and prim - ers 5033 and 5034 , and the correct 1 . 2 - kbp fragment was con - firmed by PCR with oligonucleotides 2717 and 4036 . YJB12711 was constructed by transforming YJB12377 with the 2 . 1 - kb ampli - fication product from pGEM - ARG4 using primers 4368 and 4369 . The PCR product was transformed into strain YJB12377 ( Tub1 - GFP , Mtw1 - mCherry ) , and the correct 1 . 5 - kb product was detected by amplification with primers 4371 and 730 . We were not able to directly measure Kip1 copy number in this KIP1 / kip1 ∆ strain ( YJB12711 ) . However , its spindle phenotype and the fact that it was complemented with ScCIN8 ( in YJB13203 ) are consistent with the idea that the Kip1 protein concentration is reduced in YJB12711 . YJB12162 was constructed by transforming RM1000 with a 3 . 9 - kbp PCR product amplified from pMG2120 and primers 4732 and 4733 , and the transformants were screened by PCR with oligonucleotides 658 and 4734 for a 872 – base pair product , and the GFP fusion was confirmed by DNA sequencing . YJB13092 was constructed by transforming YJB12162 with the 3 . 0 - kbp PCR product amplified from pMG2254 and primers 5838 and 5839 . Transformants were selected on SDC - Ura and confirmed by PCR amplification of a 1 . 2 - kbp product with primers 944 and 1434 . YJB13121 was con - structed by transforming YJB12377 with the 2 . 1 - kbp PCR product amplified from pGEM - ARG4 and primers 6042 and 6043 . Transfor - mants were selected on SDC - Arg and confirmed by PCR amplifica - tion of an 820 – base pair product with primers 6044 and 1251 and a 1 . 7 - kbp product with primers 730 and 6045 . We were unable to di - rectly measure Kip3 copy number in this KIP3 / kip3 ∆ strain ( YJB13121 ) . Once again , however , its spindle phenotype is consis - tent with the idea that the Kip3 protein concentration was reduced in this strain . YJB13143 was constructed by transforming YJB12377 with the 1 . 6 - kbp PCR product amplified from pGEM - URA3 and primers 6056 and 6057 . Transformants were selected on SDC - URA and confirmed by PCR amplification of a 1 . 2 - kbp product with primers 944 and 5624 and a 3 . 3 - kbp product with primers 5621 and 945 . YJB12859 was constructed by transforming BWP17 with the PCR product amplified from pMG2343 and primers 5345 and 4311 . Transformants were selected on yeast extract – peptone – dextrose medium + adenine ( YPAD ) + nourseothricin ( NAT ) and confirmed by PCR amplification of a 1 - kbp product with primers 3326 and 4313 . YJB13180 was constructed by transforming YJB12859 with the 3 . 7 - kbp PCR product amplified from pMG1646 and primers 2715 and 4266 . Transformants were selected on SDC - His and confirmed by PCR amplification of a 1 . 1 - kbp product with primers 2717 and 658 . YJB13196 was constructed by transforming YJB8675 with the 3 . 1 - kbp PCR product amplified from pMG2254 and primers 4311 and 4312 . Transformants were selected on SDC - Ura and confirmed by PCR amplification of a 1 . 0 - kbp product with primers 4313 and 4036 . YJB13203 was constructed by transforming YJB13196 with the 2 . 8 - kbp PCR product amplified from pGEM - HIS1 and primers 4368 and Volume 26 November 5 , 2015 Limits on chromosome congression | 4013 2010 ; Gardner and Odde , 2010 ) . Briefly , for C . albicans spindles , 32 kMTs ( 16 from each SPB ) were simulated to allow each of the eight diploid chromosomes ( i . e . , 16 replicated chromosomes , for a total of 32 sister chromatids ) a single attachment to each pole , and four total iMTs ( two from each SPB ) were simulated ( Joglekar et al . , 2008 ) . The spindle length was fixed at 840 nm to match the ob - served experimental mean spindle length ( 837 ± 8 nm ; see Results ) for the WT and 766 nm for the KIP1 / kip1 ∆ simulation . As described in Sprague et al . ( 2003 ) , only the plus ends of the MTs were allowed to undergo dynamic instability because the majority of kMT dynam - ics takes place at the plus end ( Maddox et al . , 2000 ; Gardner et al . , 2005 ) , and the minus ends were fixed at the SPBs . Thirty motors were used to simulate WT conditions and 10 to simulate KIP1 / kip1 ∆ conditions . All simulations started with no initial motor attachments . All parameters for both conditions are given in Supplemental Table S3 . Parameters for the S . cerevisiae simulations were taken directly from Gardner et al . ( 2008 ) . All other simulation details were previously described ( Sprague et al . , 2003 , Gardner et al . , 2005 , 2008 , 2010 ; Gardner and Odde 2010 ) . Measuring spindle lengths and kinetochore microtubule lengths in Drosophila S2 cells and PtK1 cells Nonadherent Drosophila S2 cells were maintained in culture in T25 flasks at room temperature in M3 insect medium supplemented with 10 % insect medium supplement ( IMS ) plus 2 % fetal bovine se - rum albumin and 10 % penicillin / streptomycin . All cells were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 7 Live swept - field confocal microscope using a 100 × / 1 . 45 NA Plan - Fluor oil immersion objective with 488 - and 561 - nm lasers and 495 - to 555 - nm and 575 - to 615 - nm plus long - pass 655 - nm filter sets . Images were collected on a 1 × 512 line scanning 12 - bit CCD camera with 60 % quantum efficiency . Spindle lengths and kinetochore microtubule lengths were measured using the measurement tool in ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . PtK1 cell spindle and kinetochore microtubule lengths were measured using the same approach using data from Figures 2 , A and B , and 3 , A and B in Cimini et al . ( 2004 ) .
