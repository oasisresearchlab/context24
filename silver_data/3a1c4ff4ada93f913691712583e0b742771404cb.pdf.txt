BONALDI @ santepubliquefrance . fr Abstract Background The effective reproduction number ( R t ) quantifies the average number of secondary cases caused by one person with an infectious disease . Near - real - time monitoring of R t during an outbreak is a major indicator used to monitor changes in disease transmission and assess the effectiveness of interventions . The estimation of R t usually requires the identification of infected cases in the population , which can prove challenging with the available data , espe - cially when asymptomatic people or with mild symptoms are not usually screened . The pur - pose of this study was to perform sensitivity analysis of R t estimates for COVID - 19 surveillance in France based on three data sources with different sensitivities and specifici - ties for identifying infected cases . Methods We applied a statistical method developed by Cori et al . to estimate R t using ( 1 ) confirmed cases identified from positive virological tests in the population , ( 2 ) suspected cases recorded by a national network of emergency departments , and ( 3 ) COVID - 19 hospital admissions recorded by a national administrative system to manage hospital organization . Results R t estimates in France from May 27 , 2020 , to August 12 , 2022 , showed similar temporal trends regardless of the dataset . Estimates based on the daily number of confirmed cases provided an earlier signal than the two other sources , with an average lag of 3 and 6 days for estimates based on emergency department visits and hospital admissions , respectively . Conclusion The COVID - 19 experience confirmed that monitoring temporal changes in R t was a key indi - cator to help the public health authorities control the outbreak in real time .

Data Availability Statement : The data underlying the results presented in the study are available from https : / / github . com / christophe - bonaldi / Monitoring - R - effective . access to data on all infected people in the population in order to estimate R t is not straight - forward in practice . As this analysis has shown , the opportunity to use more readily available data to estimate R t trends , provided that it is highly correlated with the spread of infection , provides a practical solution for monitoring the COVID - 19 pandemic and indeed any other epidemic . Introduction The effective ( or time - varying ) reproduction number , R t , represents the average number of secondary cases at time t of an outbreak caused by an infected person during the infectious period . If R t is greater than 1 , each infected person transmits the virus to more than one person on average , meaning that the epidemic grows . If R t is less than 1 , an infected person infects less than one person on average , resulting in the decline of the epidemic . The near real - time estimation of R t makes it possible to monitor the outbreak over time and evaluate the effectiveness of strategies implemented to control the infection by reducing R t and maintaining it to values below 1 [ 1 , 2 ] . As the COVID - 19 outbreak has shown , along with other available epidemiological data , R constitutes also an important indicator to help guide appropriate health policies and policymakers decisions [ 3 – 7 ] . Several methods have been developed to estimate R t in an epidemic context , although the majority are based on transmission models [ 8 – 10 ] . These require many parameters , time , and expertise or incidence data from times later than t which limit their use in real practice . Accordingly , these methods do not allow for the real - time or near real - time monitoring of var - iations in R t . In 2013 , a team of modelers from Imperial College London published a simpler method for estimating the effective reproduction number [ 11 , 12 ] . Drawing on this method , Sante´ publique France , the French Agency for Public Health , has produced daily R t values at the national and regional levels to monitor the spread of COVID - 19 in near real - time since May 27 , 2020 . The aim of this paper is to assess the ability of the method to monitor variations in R t based on three data sources with different levels of sensitivity and specificity . Methods Data collection To monitor the spread of COVID - 19 in France , three data sources were used to estimate R t . The daily number of confirmed cases of COVID - 19 was obtained from the SI - DEP database ( Système d’Information de Dépistage en Population – Population - based Screening Information System ) , which records data on all virological testing carried out in France ( metropolitan and overseas territories ) to diagnose COVID - 19 [ 13 ] . More precisely , SI - DEP includes the results of reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) tests carried out by all medical laboratories and hospitals for the diagnosis of SARS - CoV - 2 , as well as antigenic tests per - formed by medical laboratories , pharmacists , physicians , and nurses . The SI - DEP system , which was specifically created to monitor the COVID - 19 pandemic , has been fully operational since May 13 , 2020 . In France , the main indications for conducting COVID - 19 tests were to confirm a diagnosis of suspected COVID - 19 , to carry out a control test to end isolation , or to obtain a COVID - 19 certificate . In addition , local screening strategies could be implemented on an ad hoc basis , particularly in the case of clusters . R t was also estimated from the OSCOUR network ( Organisation de la surveillance coordon - née des urgences – Coordinated emergency surveillance network ) . This national surveillance PLOS ONE Monitoringthe reproduction number of COVID - 19 in France PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0293585 October 31 , 2023 2 / 11 Funding : The authors received nospecific funding for this work . Competinginterests : The authorshave declared that no competinginterestsexist . network , which collects emergency department ( ED ) visits from about 700 French EDs ( 94 % of national all - cause ED visits ) , is the main component of syndrome - based surveillance of ED carried out by Sante´ publique France [ 14 , 15 ] . We used the daily number of ED visits with sus - pected COVID - 19 diagnosed by the emergency physicians taking care of the patient . To stan - dardize practices for the classification code of suspected COVID - 19 in the system and to ensure consistency in the diagnosis of COVID - 19 by physicians , some recommendations detailing the clinical picture of patients suspected of being infected were sent to all EDs . These recommendations were important at the start of the pandemic , as COVID - 19 was an emerging disease . The symptoms were not specific and could be confused with other illnesses such as influenza . Finally , the third data source was the daily number of hospital admissions for COVID - 19 recorded in the SI - VIC database ( Système d’information unique des victimes – National victim information system ) . The SI - VIC system is primarily used to help health authorities monitor the number of persons hospitalized because of a health emergency and anticipate its conse - quences for the organization of hospitals . We included admissions to both general wards and intensive care units but excluded emergency , psychiatric , long - term , and rehabilitation care . These three datasets differ in terms of their sensitivity and specificity to identify COVID - 19 cases in the population . Not all infections are tested and thus included in the SI - DEP ( sensitiv - ity default ) . The OSCOUR network includes symptomatic individuals , often not tested in the ED , with a proportion not being COVID cases ( specificity default ) . The COVID - 19 patients seen in the ED are also likely to have more severe symptoms such as respiratory distress as opposed to moderate or mild symptoms ( sensibility default ) . SI - VIC data were highly specific – all hospitalized patients were confirmed COVID - 19 cases – but it only recorded hospitalized COVID - 19 cases . Statistical method The method used for estimating the time - varying reproduction number based on Cori et al . [ 11 ] was implemented in R software ( version 4 . 1 . 1 , R Foundation for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) using the EpiEstim package . EpiEstim is considered the most computationally efficient and ready - to - use software that is currently available [ 16 , 17 ] . In short , the method can be divided into two main steps . First , the time series of daily counts of patients were smoothed using cubic smoothing splines to remove random daily variations and weekend effects . Second , the reproduction number was estimated with EpiEstim using a 7 - day sliding window and under the assumption that the serial interval ( time between symptom onset in an index case and symptom onset in a secondary case ) fol - lowed a gamma distribution with a mean of 7 days and a standard deviation of 5 . 2 days . The parameters for the gamma distribution were fixed according to the model by Salje et al . [ 18 ] . Uncertainty intervals for R t were provided by the 95 % credibility intervals from the estimated R t posterior distribution in the Bayesian framework of the EpiEstim method . A comparison of the daily patterns of the estimated R t from the three datasets ran from May 27 , 2020 , to August 12 , 2022 . Results Fig 1 shows the daily case counts recorded in each database in metropolitan France from May 13 , 2020 , to August 12 , 2022 . As expected , the absolute number of cases reported by each sys - tem differed substantially , with much larger volumes for the SI - DEP data compared to the two other data sources . The three databases had a weekly cycle , although this was particularly evi - dent for the SI - DEP data for which screening activity was down on weekends due to the weekly PLOS ONE Monitoringthe reproduction number of COVID - 19 in France PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0293585 October 31 , 2023 3 / 11 closure of many private medical laboratories and pharmacists . Regardless of the level of the counts , temporal curves showed similar patterns , particularly when comparing OSCOUR and SI - VIC data . In the three data sources , a rapid decline in case counts occurred just after the implementation of national lockdowns to stop the second and third pandemic waves observed in France . The lockdown from October 29 to December 14 , 2020 imposed confinement mea - sures like movement restrictions , closure of non - essential shops but schools remained open . The lockdown between April 3 rd and May 2 nd , 2021 was less restrictive for movements and shopping but imposed closure of schools . Fig 1 .

As desired , R t decreased and fell below 1 after the implementation of nationwide lockdowns . However , dur - ing the second confinement , we observe a rebound in the estimate , which increases to a value close to 1 at the end of the confinement . For the entire period , the three curves were closed , except for a few weeks in 2020 between mid - July and late September . However , this period was marked by a sluggish increase in the pandemic , with a very small number of daily cases reported by the three information systems ( Fig 1 ) . In particular , this resulted in wider credibil - ity intervals for the R t estimates . Fig 3 shows the distribution of the differences between the daily estimates calculated using the three datasets . The median differences were similar and close to zero , with the extreme dif - ferences observed near the peaks and troughs of the time series for the R t values ( Fig 2 ) . Over - all , a slight time lag is perceptible between the R t curve estimated from SI - DEP and the curves estimated from the two other datasets : based on the maximum correlation , a lag of 3 and 6 days was observed for OSCOUR and SI - VIC , respectively ( Table 1 ) . Discussion In France , the estimates of the instantaneous reproduction number R t used to monitor the spread of COVID - 19 showed similar trends regardless of the dataset used : confirmed cases among the tested population ( SI - DEP ) , suspected cases in ED visits ( OSCOUR ) , or hospital - ized patients ( SI - VIC ) . Estimates based on the daily number of cases identified from the viro - logical test results ( SI - DEP ) provided an earlier signal that the two other data sources . This finding was predictable due to the nature of the data recorded by the three information sys - tems , which collect data on cases at different infection stages . Indeed , the average time between symptom onset and testing is around 1 – 2 days ( mean delay observed in the SI - DEP data ) , while hospitalizations occur approximately 6 to 7 days after the onset of symptoms [ 18 ] . This is consistent with the lag of 6 days observed between R t estimated from hospitalization data ( SI - VIC ) and R t estimated from virological test results ( SI - DEP ) .

As noted , the major discrepancies observed for a few weeks in 2020 ( from mid - July to Sep - tember ) between the three estimates corresponded to a period of low incidence . During this period , an accurate estimate was not possible , because the R t values were particularly volatile . Fig 3 .

In addition , for a few months at the start of the pandemic until the end of 2020 , a significant number of cases reported by the ED were not tested , although with the increasing availability of tests and especially antigen tests over time , an increasing pro - portion of cases notified through the OSCOUR system were confirmed cases . This might explain why the R t series became more similar over time . The instantaneous reproduction number found using the results of virological tests ( SI - DEP ) provided higher peak and trough values than the estimates based on the number of suspected cases in ED visits or hospitalized patients . The number of confirmed cases in tested patients are sensitive to factors such as screening control strategies or contact behaviors of con - firmed cases , which could explain why the peak and trough values are higher . Differences between the extreme values of the R t estimates seem notably higher since late 2021 . This period corresponds to the emergence of three factors influencing the evolution of the pandemic : ( 1 ) the greater use of spontaneous testing before and during the Christmas and New Year period , which increased the number of identified positive cases , particularly asymptomatic cases ; ( 2 ) the effect of vaccinating a significant proportion of the population , especially the most vulnera - ble ; and ( 3 ) the emergence of more contagious but less severe variants , thereby reducing the incidence of severe cases in ED and hospitals . As a result , the R t estimates showed greater dif - ferences in the extreme values , although the overall trend remained robust regardless of the data used for the estimation . Over the entire period studied , estimates of R t have fluctuated constantly . The largest waves are correlated with the emergence of new variants such as the Alpha variant at the end of 2020 , the Delta variant in the summer of 2021 and the Omicron variant at the beginning of 2022 . Contextual events such as the Christmas and New Year period could explain the peak observed in 2021 . We also noticed that during the second lockdown , the number of reproductions had surprisingly rebounded after reaching a minimum value , returning to a value close to 1 when the lockdown ended . The second national lockdown was less strict than the first one ( from March 17 to May 3 , 2020 ) , but all schools remained open . This could suggest that children and adolescents—who present a low risk of infection or if they are infected it is likely to be mild— may have been transmitters of the virus into the household during this period . It should be noted that we did not observe this phenomenon during the third lockdown , which was charac - terized by a reversed strategy with the early closure of schools before the Easter school holidays . The EpiEstim package provided a straightforward method to estimate time - varying instan - taneous reproduction numbers using time series of incident cases ( confirmed cases , ED visits , or hospitalizations ) . We retrospectively showed that using this method to monitor the dynam - ics of the COVID - 19 pandemic in France was effective in detecting temporal variations in the Table 1 .

The implementation of EpiEstim requires knowledge of the serial interval distribution , which we assumed to be gamma distributed with a mean of 7 days and a standard deviation of 5 . 2 days based on the model by Salje et al [ 18 ] and consistent with the analysis of the first transmission chains in France [ 19 ] . We used the same distribution over the whole study period . One limitation of this approach is that it does not account for temporal variations in the serial interval distribution . Such variations can occur due to changes in people’s behavior or policy interventions adopted in a country to limit the spread of the disease [ 20 ] . For instance , it has been demonstrated that case isolation can reduce the serial interval [ 21 ] . Other studies found lower serial intervals such as around 5 days in the meta - analysis of Rai et al [ 22 ] . In addition , recent studies reported even shorter serial intervals in SARS - CoV - 2 with the new Omicron variant—appeared in France at the end of November 2021—compared to the Delta variant [ 23 , 24 ] . Varying the dis - tribution parameters of the serial interval can affect the magnitude of the daily estimates of R t with higher values ( when R t > 1 ) when the mean increased [ 20 ] . Conversely , as the standard deviation of the serial interval increases , the estimate of Rt decreases [ 25 ] ( see Supporting information ) . It should be noted that in Cori’s method , the serial interval is used as a substitute for the generation interval ( the time elapsed between the infections of an infector and an infected person ) . But replacing the generation interval with the serial interval tends to bias the estimate of Rt [ 26 ] . In particular , when the variance of the serial interval is higher than that of the generation interval , Rt will consequently be underestimated . As illustrated in the article by Ganyani et al . [ 27 ] for COVID - 19 , the standard deviation of the generation interval is generally smaller than that of the serial interval . However , this does not affect the time when R t crosses the threshold of 1 , which is one of the most important indicators for public health decision - makers . Over the whole period , the estimated R t does not exceed the value of 2 . 1 , obtained from SI - DEP data in July 2021 . The new Omicron variant that appeared in France at the end of November 2021 was supposed to be much more contagious than the Delta variant , which was the majority variant . However , when this new variant appeared , the peaks in the R t did not exceed 1 . 8 , at the end of December 2021 . This observation is not consistent with the average R t of 3 . 4 reported by Liu et al . [ 26 ] for the Omicron variant . However , we can assume that the impact of vaccination—over 75 % of the French population had full vaccination coverage by December 2021—limited the spread of the virus . The estimated Rt was therefore much lower than the peak observed in July 2021 , when the delta variant was in the majority and vaccina - tion coverage was lower . In addition , there were 2 major waves : the first starting in November , but probably still linked to the delta variant , and a rebound in mid - December linked to the spread of the Omicron variant in combination with the end - of - year festivities . Again , immu - nity induced by the vaccine or contamination probably helped to limit the spread of the vari - ant . Finally , it should also be noted that preventive measures like masks on public transport , widespread teleworking , reception of a limited number of customers depending on the surface area in shops or subject to vaccination certificate , etc . were still in force at that time in France ( until 12 February 2021 for the most part ) . This may also have helped to limit the spread of this variant in France . The size of the sliding window over which the R t estimates are calculated was fixed to 7 days in our analysis . This time window acts as a smoothing parameter with more pronounced smoothing ( along with narrower credible intervals ) as the window increases in size [ 11 ] . How - ever , a wider window makes the estimates less responsive which means it constrains the ability to observe the most recent changes in the reproduction numbers . In our case , a 7 - day sliding window was considered a good compromise between responsiveness and smoothness of the estimates .

In practice , however , it is often difficult to identify all infected cases in the pop - ulation [ 16 ] , particularly when a large proportion does not show symptoms as in the COVID - 19 outbreak . Cori et al . [ 11 ] demonstrated with simulations that their method is robust as long as the proportion of detected cases or the fraction of asymptomatic cases remains stable over time , which we assumed in our study . In addition , this analysis shows that under the current conditions with a long observation period , the method can be reasonably applied to data such as hospitalized patients or ED reports . We can therefore assume that all the data strongly cor - related with the number of infected cases in the population are suitable for estimating the Rt temporal trends , provided that this correlation remains relatively stable over time . Monitoring changes in the Rt has proven to be a major indicator for guiding public health authorities and stakeholders for fitting infection control strategies in real time . In France , vari - ations in the Rt were widely and regularly communicated to the general public , with the Rt becoming a simple pedagogical tool to explain the need to reinforce individual preventive behaviors or implement collective protective measures when the number of reproductions exceeded 1 . The use of the popular package EpiEstim to estimate the daily Rt with input data of varying quality since the beginning of the outbreak showed the robustness of the method . Daily data relating to the total number of infected cases in a population is usually not available during a large outbreak . This may require the development of infrastructure to test people and record the test results , which is often challenging to set up , particularly in some developing countries . Along with the simplicity of the method of Cori et al . , the opportunity to use easy - to - obtain data from ED consultations or hospitalizations , provided that these data are strongly correlated with the propagation of the infection , provides a concrete solution for monitoring the COVID - 19 pandemic and , more broadly , any epidemic .
