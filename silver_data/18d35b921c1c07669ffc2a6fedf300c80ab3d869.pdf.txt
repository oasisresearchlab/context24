The dendritic nucleation model has been proposed to account for Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly and movement . Here , we explored the model by examining the role of capping protein in vivo , with quantitative tracking analysis of ﬂuorescence markers for different stages of endocytosis in yeast . Capping protein was most important for the initial movement of endocytic vesicles away from the plasma membrane , which presumably corresponds to vesicle scission and release . The next phase of endosome movement away from the plasma membrane was also affected , but less so . The results are consistent with the dendritic nucleation model’s prediction of capping protein as important for efﬁcient actin assembly and force production . In contrast , the movement of late - stage endocytic vesicles , traveling through the cyto - plasm en route to the vacuole , did not depend on capping protein . The movement of these vesicles was found previously to depend on Lsb6 , a WASp interactor , whereas Lsb6 was found here to be dispensable for early endosome movement . Thus , the molecular requirements for Arp2 / 3 - based actin assembly differ in early versus later stages of endocytosis . Finally , acute loss of actin cables led to increased patch motility . INTRODUCTION Understanding the molecular mechanisms for how actin ﬁlaments assemble and how that assembly generates move - ment in vivo are important goals in cell biology . Biochemical studies in vitro have produced a number of speciﬁc hypoth - eses regarding these molecular mechanisms . One important hypothesis is the dendritic nucleation model , which de - scribes how activated Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates the assem - bly of branched networks of actin ﬁlaments and how the added activities of capping protein and ADF / coﬁlin can modify actin assembly to produce force and move an object from which ﬁlaments are nucleated ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ; Pol - lard and Borisy , 2003 ) . In this model , the important roles proposed for the capping of barbed ends , by capping pro - tein , are to keep the actin ﬁlaments of the branched network short , which makes the network strong , and to conﬁne the growth of ﬁlaments to newly created free barbed ends , which are near the object to be moved . Recent studies with synthetic systems show that capping protein is crucial for actin ﬁlaments that assemble around beads to break sym - metry and produce movement ( Akin and Mullins , personal communication ) . The importance of ADF / coﬁlin has been proposed to be promotion of actin ﬁlament disassembly , which produces actin subunits that recycle into the system by adding to new free barbed ends . The system thus oper - ates at a steady state far from equilibrium , with a ﬂux of actin subunits generating force and movement . In cells , networks of actin ﬁlaments with the branching pattern characteristic of Arp2 / 3 complex can be found , and Arp2 / 3 activity is important for actin assembly and motility in certain situations ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) , supporting the relevance of the dendritic nucleation model in vivo . Our goal is to explore and test the model in living cells , and budding yeast provide a good system for this task . Yeast cells have foci of ﬁlamentous actin at the cortex , called patches , whose formation and movement depend on Arp2 / 3 complex and actin polymerization ( Winter et al . , 1997 ; Carlsson et al . , 2002 ) . Actin patch formation and move - ment is associated with the formation of endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane and their movement into the cell ( Huckaba et al . , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ; Duncan and Payne , 2005 ) . Patches contain actin ﬁlaments with 70° end - to - side branches , which are characteristic of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Young et al . , 2004 ; Rodal et al . , 2005 ) . Capping protein ( Cap1 / Cap2 ) and coﬁlin ( Cof1 ) are present in patches ( Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ) . Thus , the dendritic nucleation model may apply to actin patch forma - tion and movement in yeast . Endocytic vesicles that carry membrane proteins destined for degradation move through the cytoplasm to the vacuole . Electron microscopy ( EM ) morphology studies found that the process of endocytosis begins with small round vesicles , proceeds to a vesicular / tubular compartment , followed by multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) , and , ultimately , the vacuole ( Prescianotto - Baschong and Riezman , 1998 ) .

In live cell imaging , Ste2 - green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) is seen diffusely at the plasma membrane , as small vesicles moving rapidly through the cytoplasm , as brighter vesicles on the surface of the vacuole ( presumably docked MVBs about to fuse ) , and in the vacuole ( Chang et al . , 2003 ) . The movement of Ste2 vesicles through the cytoplasm depends on actin polymer - ization and WASp / Las17 , which binds to Arp2 / 3 complex ( Chang et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . Also , the speeds of Ste2 vesicles are comparable to those of actin patches ( Chang et al . , 2003 ) . In contrast , Ste2 vesicles do not have detectable actin or Arp2 / 3 complex , by methods that detect them readily on actin patches . To investigate the mechanism by which actin polymeriza - tion drives the assembly and movement of cortical actin patches and the movement of endocytic vesicles , we ana - lyzed their assembly and movement using computer - as - sisted tracking of GFP - labeled components in movies of living cells . The method allows one to track hundreds of patches or vesicles in many cells , outputting data for their position and ﬂuorescence intensity over time . Analyzing many patches and vesicles in a quantitative manner was important because of the high amount of variability in the behavior of the individual entities . We found differences in the results for actin patches compared with Ste2 vesicles , suggesting differences in their molecular mechanisms for actin - based assembly and motility . The results for actin patches were consistent with predictions of the dendritic nucleation model . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Growth and Light Microscopy Cells were grown overnight at 30°C in YPD to an A 600 of 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 . Cells were harvested at low speed , resuspended in SD - complete media , and placed on 2 % agarose pads made with SD - complete media . For latrunculin A ( LatA ) treatment , cells were treated with 200 (cid:1) M LatA with 1 % dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) in SD - complete media for 20 min at 30°C with shaking . Cells were harvested , resuspended in a smaller volume of the same media , and placed on agarose pads containing the same concentration of LatA and DMSO . For temperature shift experiments , slides were placed at the restrictive tempera - ture for 5 min before imaging , and observations were completed within 30 min of the temperature shift . GFP ﬂuorescence movies were made with a spinning disk confocal system that included an upright Olympus BX52 microscope , a Yokogawa CSU10 spinning disk head , Ar laser light sources , a 100 (cid:1) numerical aperture ( NA ) 1 . 4 PlanApo oil objective , and an intensiﬁed charge - coupled device ( CCD ) videocamera ( Stanford XR Mega10 S30 ) . The temperature of the specimen and stage was maintained at 30°C , except for temperature shift experiments . The image was focused at an equatorial plane of the cells , near the mother / bud neck . Movies were collected with a frame rate of 5 / s , and their duration was 40 – 50 s . QED software ( Media Cybernetics , Silver Spring , MD ) controlled the system . Dual imaging of yellow ﬂuorescent protein ( YFP ) and cyan ﬂuores - cent protein ( CFP ) was performed with a wide - ﬁeld ﬂuorescence inverted microscope ( Olympus IX 70 ) , a 100 (cid:1) oil NA 1 . 4 objective lens , YFP and CFP ﬁlter cubes , and a cooled CCD video camera ( Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ ) controlled by QED software . Computer - assisted Tracking of Movement We tracked the position of actin patches or membrane vesicles from ﬂuores - cence microscopy movies , as described previously ( Carlsson et al . , 2002 ) . Movie 1 shows an example of tracking . The experimenter viewed each movie and track to conﬁrm the validity of the computer tracking . We often adjusted the start or end of the track by a frame or two , and we removed erroneous tracks . Zero time was the time when the patch occurred and was detected , as deﬁned by that marker . Patches in existence at the start of the movie were not included in the analysis . A track ends when its patch disappears , and this time can differ quite a bit between individual patches . The computer program produced values for position and intensity of the particle over time , which were imported into spreadsheets in Excel ( Mi - crosoft , Redmond , WA ) for motion analysis . Mean squared displacement ( MSD ) versus time was often plotted to analyze the character of the motion and to quantitate the degree of motion . The method calculates the distance a patch has moved from its point of origin , at each time point . That distance is squared , and those values are then averaged for many patches to give a mean . The plots for individual patches were generally aligned with each other at their zero time points , the beginning of each curve . The plots shown are thus averages . We generally truncated them at the time when half the patches had disappeared ; at longer times , the plots became too noisy to be informative . Thus , the length of the curve is an indication of the median lifetime . In certain cases , we lined up the individual curves , for the tracking of one patch , on the right hand side , at the end of their lifetime , instead of the left as described above . This method is helpful if a patch is stationary for a variable amount of time and then moves , because all the potential movements occur at the end . In addition , we collected the value for the lifetime of each patch at the membrane directly in certain cases . Strain Construction Yeast strains are listed in Table 1 . Wild - type haploid strains expressing Abp1 - GFP , Cap1 - GFP , Las17 - GFP , or Sla2 - GFP were constructed by integrat - ing GFP at the 3 (cid:2) end of the ABP1 , CAP1 , LAS17 , SAC6 , or SLA2 coding region , as described previously ( Karpova et al . , 1998 ) , in a Yeast Gene Deletion Collection MAT a wild - type haploid ( BY4741 , MAT a his3 (cid:3) 1 ura 3 (cid:3) leu2 (cid:3) met15 (cid:3) ) , resulting in strains YJC 2719 , 2718 , 3420 , 3396 , and 3398 , respectively . The polarization of the actin cytoskeleton was normal in strains expressing Cap1 - GFP ( YJC 2718 ) , Sac6 - GFP ( YJC 3396 ) , Sla1 - GFP ( YJC 4001 ) , or Sla2 - GFP ( YJC 3398 ) , indicating that the fusion proteins were functional . The movement of actin patches was similar in strains expressing either Cap1 - GFP , Abp1 - GFP , or Sac6 - GFP , also consistent with normal function for the fusion proteins . Haploid wild - type , cap1 (cid:3) , and cap2 (cid:3) strains expressing various GFP fu - sions were prepared by crossing YJC 2719 , 3420 , 3396 , and 3398 with the cap1 (cid:3) strain YJC 3538 and the cap2 (cid:3) strain YJC 0171 . Tetrad dissection produced the strains YJC 3481 – 4090 listed in Table 1 . Additional independent wild - type strains for analysis were generated by crossing YJC 2719 and 3398 with the Yeast Gene Deletion Collection MAT (cid:1) aip1 (cid:3) strain ( record number 16227 ) . Sporulation and tetrad dissection pro - duced the Abp1 - GFP wild - type strains YJC 4297 , 4298 , and 4299 , and the Sla2 - GFP wild - type strains YJC 4294 , 4295 , and 4296 . A wild - type strain expressing a Las17 – 3XGFP fusion from the endogenous locus was prepared using a pBS - 3xGFP - TRP1 plasmid as described previ - ously ( Lee et al . , 2003 ) to produce YJC 4579 , which was used in experiments for Figure 1 , C and E . lsb6 (cid:3) mutants expressing Abp1 - GFP were prepared by crossing YJC 2719 with the Yeast Gene Deletion Collection MAT (cid:2) lsb6 (cid:3) strain ( record number 11323 ) . Sporulation and tetrad dissection produced the ABP1 - GFP lsb6 (cid:3) hap - loids YJC 4300 , 4301 , and 4302 and the ABP1 - GFP wild - type haploid YJC 4303 . The lsb6 deletion was conﬁrmed by PCR analysis . To overexpress capping protein , we expressed Cap1 and Cap2 from a 2 (cid:1) plasmid containing the bidirectional inducible promoter GAL 1 / 10 . A wild - type Abp1 - GFP strain , YJC2719 , was transformed with the plasmid pBJ114 to produce YJC 4091 . Capping protein ( CP ) overexpression was induced by overnight growth in 2 % rafﬁnose , followed by 2 % galactose overnight . To track patches in formin mutants , haploid bnr1 (cid:3) , bnr1 (cid:3) bni1 - 11 and bnr1 (cid:3) bni1 - 12 strains , kindly provided by Dr . Anthony Bretscher ( Cornell Univer - sity , Ithaca , NY ) as strain numbers Y2304 , Y3084 , and Y3089 ( Evangelista et al . , 2002 ) , were transfected with a PCR product prepared from a Longtine vector ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) , which integrated GFP at the 3 (cid:2) end of ABP1 . The parent strains were numbered YJC 4244 , 4245 , and 4246 , and the resulting Abp1 - GFP strains were YJC 4247 , 4248 , and 4249 . FM4 - 64 Pulse Labeling Cells were incubated with FM4 - 64 as described previously ( Chang et al . , 2003 ) , with some modiﬁcations . Cells were incubated with 10 (cid:1) M FM4 - 64 on ice for 2 min and then washed into ice - cold nonﬂuorescent media . Next , the cells were incubated with fresh nonﬂuorescent ( NF ) medium at 30°C . Ali - quots were removed at various times and ﬁxed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde . The cells were examined with a wide - ﬁeld ﬂuorescence inverted microscope ( Olympus IX 70 ) , a 100 (cid:1) oil NA 1 . 4 objective lens , a rhodamine ﬁlter cube , and a cooled CCD videocamera ( Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ ) controlled by QED software . Individual cells were scored into one of the following catego - ries : plasma membrane (cid:4) endosome , ﬂuorescence on the plasma membrane and endocytic vesicles near or on the plasma membrane ; endosome alone , ﬂuorescence exclusively on endocytic vesicles in the cytoplasm ; or endosome and vacuole , ﬂuorescence on vacuoles and cytoplasmic vesicles . Cells ( 100 – 200 ) were scored per time point . Wt ( YJC 2588 ) , cap1 (cid:3) ( YJC 2538 ) , and sla2 (cid:3) haploid MAT a strains were from the Yeast Gene Deletion Collection ( Invitro - gen , Carlsbad , CA ) ( Winzeler et al . , 1999 ) . Tracking of FM4 - 64 and Ste2 - GFP Cytoplasmic Vesicles For FM4 - 64 labeling , cells were incubated on ice with 9 (cid:1) M FM4 - 64 for 1 – 2 min and then washed into nonﬂuorescent medium at room temperature ( RT ) . Wild - type cells were kept at RT for 2 min and cap1 (cid:3) cells for 5 min because membrane is internalized more slowly in cap1 (cid:3) cells . Time - lapse ﬂuorescence images were acquired at a rate of 1 frame / s , with an integration time of 80 ms / frame for a total of 90 – 100 frames . Images were collected on a wide - ﬁeld Actin and Endocytosis Vol . 17 , March 2006 1355 inverted ﬂuorescence microscope as described above . To generate yeast strains expressing Ste2 - GFP , strains YJC 2588 ( wild - type ) and 2538 ( cap1 (cid:3) ) were transformed with a multicopy Ste2 - GFP plasmid based on pRS426 ( Chang et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . GFP imaging was performed on a spinning disk system , as described above . FM4 - 64 and Ste2 - GFP ﬂuorescence were both observed at the plasma membrane , in freely moving particles , in the vacuole , and in particles adherent to the vacuole . Only freely moving particles in cytoplasm were tracked , and we required that they be visible for (cid:5) 6 s . Table 1 . Yeast strains used in this study YJC Name Source Genotype 0093 Wt , W303 R .

Kim et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1356 Single - Copy Expression of Ste2 - GFP . We repeated the Ste2 - GFP experiments in strains expressing Ste2 - GFP from the endogenous STE2 locus . A haploid MAT a strain expressing Ste2 - GFP from the endogenous locus was taken from the Yeast GFP Clone Collection ( Invitrogen ) ( Huh et al . , 2003 ) and mated with a MAT (cid:2) cap1 (cid:3) haploid from the Yeast Gene Deletion Collection ( Invitrogen ) ( Winzeler et al . , 1999 ) . Two resulting diploids were sporulated , and tetrads were dissected to produce haploid CAP1 ( YJC 4384 ) and cap1 (cid:3) ( YJC 4381 ) strains expressing Ste2 - GFP . Cells were grown overnight at 30°C . Time - lapse movies at 1 frame / s were collected on an upright Olympus ﬂuorescence microscope , as described above , with an exposure time of 860 ms . One hundred images were collected per movie . One or two freely moving Ste2 - GFP vesicles could be seen per cell , and their motion was tracked . Thirty and 26 vesicles were tracked in the wild - type and cap1 (cid:3) strain , respectively . The MSD plots for wild - type and cap1 (cid:3) strains were similar to each other , as observed with plasmid - based higher expression of Ste2 - GFP . Ste2 - GFP vesi - cles are entirely of endocytic origin because they are absent in cells expressing a form of Ste2 - GFP that is completely blocked for endocytic internalization but is otherwise well expressed and functional at the plasma membrane ( Stefan and Blumer , 1999 ) . RESULTS Deﬁning the Phases of Actin Patch Assembly and Movement For actin patches , the phases in their life have been deﬁned by the presence of different components and by the character of their movement ( Figure 1A ) . Phase I is characterized by the presence of WASp / Las17 , a protein that targets active Arp2 / 3 complex ( Wen and Rubenstein , 2005 ) . Phase I patches show a limited amount of motion , which is random in direction and restricted in range , as though the patch were in a corral or anchored by a tether on the plasma membrane . To quantitatively analyze the motion of many patches under different conditions , we developed a computer - as - sisted method to track the position of patches over time in movies of living cells expressing GFP fusion proteins ( Carls - son et al . , 2002 ) . Movie 1 helps to illustrate the method . One useful way to analyze these data is to calculate the square of the distance of the patch from its starting point . The average of these values , the mean squared displacement ( MSD ) , is then plotted versus time . Such plots reveal the character of the motion as well as quantitating its magnitude . Tethered random motion , characteristic of phase I , produces an MSD plot that is concave down , approaching a horizontal asymp - tote ( corralled / tethered in Figure 1B ; Las17 – 3XGFP in Fig - ure 1C ) . Actin patches accumulate endocytic adaptors and actin - binding proteins over time . The tethered movement characteristic of phase I is also observed at the start of MSD plots with GFP labeling of the endocytic adaptors Sla1 and Sla2 , and the actin - binding proteins Abp1 , ﬁmbrin ( Sac6 ) , and capping protein ( Cap1 / Cap2 ) , which bind to actin ﬁla - ments in different ways . Phase II is the initial movement of the patch away from the membrane . This movement is slow and short , compared with subsequent movement in phase III . Phase II movement is observed with GFP labeling of the endocytic adaptors and the actin - binding proteins , but not with WASp / Las17 ( Fig - ure 1C ) . In MSD plots , phase II movement occurs as a relatively straight segment of low slope . Phase III consists of longer and faster movement directed away from the mem - brane , which shows in MSD plots as a concave - up segment of the curve after phase II . Phase III movement is only seen when tracking actin - binding proteins ( Figure 1C ) . Dependence of Movement on Actin Polymerization In the current model relating actin assembly to endocytosis ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) , the movements associated with phase II and phase III depend on actin polymerization , and we found this to be the case by using Abp1 - GFP to track the patches . LatA at 50 (cid:1) M partially inhibited patch movement , and 100 – 200 (cid:1) M LatA provided complete inhibition , as seen in MSD plots ( Figure 1D ) . The lifetime of the patches was increased in LatA , manifested in MSD plots by the curves extending to longer times . These plots were cut off when half the patches disappeared , indicating the median lifetime of the patches . The Abp1 - GFP ﬂuorescence intensity per patch decreased over time upon addition of LatA ( our unpub - Figure 1 .

For Abp1 - GFP , the curve is the mean from 548 patches from ﬁve strains : YJC 2719 , 4297 , 4298 , 4299 , and 4303 . For Sla2 - GFP , there were 266 patches from three strains : YJC 4294 , 4295 , and 4296 . Las17 - GFP was a 3XGFP fusion , and the curve is based on 63 patches from strain YJC 4579 .

Cells were treated with 200 (cid:1) M LatA in SD - complete medium with 1 % DMSO for 20 min . Strain YJC 2719 was used , and the number of patches averaged for each curve is as follows : untreated , 115 ; DMSO , 78 ; 50 (cid:1) M , 125 ; 100 (cid:1) M , 92 ; and 200 (cid:1) M , 64 .

As a control , formal - dehyde ﬁxation caused a complete loss of patch movement in MSD plots ( our unpublished data ) , conﬁrming that the level of noise in the detection and tracking systems was sufﬁciently low that the level of phase I movement seen here was signiﬁcant and above background . Actin and Endocytosis Vol . 17 , March 2006 1357 lished data ) , consistent with LatA inhibiting the progress of actin polymerization . Patches in phase I do move , albeit relatively little . We asked whether this movement depended on actin polymer - ization by adding LatA to Las17 - GFP cells . Patch tracking revealed that the movement was inhibited ( Figure 1E ) . The lifetime of Las17 - GFP patches was greatly prolonged by LatA , and the ﬂuorescence intensity was not decreased ( our unpublished data ) . The inhibition of movement may seem contradictory to the notion that actin polymerization is “downstream” of Las17 recruiting active Arp2 / 3 complex to the membrane . However , a locus of accumulated Las17 should be subject to forces coming from the actin ﬁlaments that polymerize around the site . The Role of Capping Protein in Actin - based Motility CP is proposed to play a central role in the dendritic nucle - ation model ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) , and CP is necessary to reconstitute the actin - based motility of Listeria with pure proteins ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . We asked whether CP was important for actin - based motility in yeast actin patches . First , we examined the assembly of CP on the actin patch with respect to other components . A Cap1 - GFP fusion pro - tein functioned normally , measured by rescue of polariza - tion of the actin cytoskeleton . We compared Cap1 - GFP with ﬁmbrin / Sac6 - GFP and Abp1 - GFP by tracking actin patches in wild - type cells . The results , as MSD plots , were essentially the same ( our unpublished data ) . We examined the order of assembly by dual - label imaging of Cap1 - YFP and Abp1 - CFP ( Figure 2 ) . Following individual patches in wild - type cells , we found a nearly complete coincidence , in space and time , between the two labels , as shown in frames from a movie ( Figure 2A ) and a graph of the ﬂuorescence intensity over time ( Figure 2B ) . Thus , the components of the actin network assemble in a concerted manner , suggesting that the assem - bly process is cooperative and rapid . Next , we examined the effect of the loss of CP on actin patch assembly and early endocytosis by imaging and track - ing actin patches in cells expressing Las17 - GFP , Sla1 - GFP , Abp1 - GFP , or Sac6 - GFP . Actin patches did form in CP mu - tants , but their movement away from the membrane was less , as seen in time - lapse images from movies ( Figure 3 and Movies 1 and 2 ) . To analyze the data quantitatively , we tracked patches in movies of several independent isolates of each genotype . To examine the behavior of all the patches within a sample , we ﬁrst produced plots of MSD versus time in which we aligned the data for individual patches on the left , at the start of the patch lifetime , and then averaged the results for all the patches from one isolate ( Figure 4 , left ) . The results for the different isolates were similar to each other , and we show examples here to illustrate the degree of variation . We also aligned the data for individual patches on the right , at the end of the patch lifetime , to focus on motion that might have occurred at the end of the track . To examine phase I , we tracked Las17 - GFP patches . There was no effect from the loss of CP , with patch tracks aligned at the start or the end of their lifetime before averaging to create MSD plots ( Figure 4 ) . Next , we measured the time that patches spent at the membrane , from the time of their initial appearance until they either moved away from the membrane or disappeared , which can result from disassem - bly or z - axis movement ( Figure 5 ) . In CP null mutants , Las17 - GFP patches did spend slightly more time at the membrane , compared with wild - type ( wt ) cells , by an amount that was statistically signiﬁcant ( Figure 5 ) . Tracking the endocytic adaptor Sla1 - GFP in CP null mu - tants , compared with wt cells , revealed substantial changes Figure 2 .

Kim et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1358 in the dynamics of patches in phase II . With MSD plots aligned on the left before averaging , cap1 / 2 cells showed much less motion for Sla1 - GFP than did wt cells ( Figure 4 , left ) . We considered two reasons for this difference . We thought that Sla1 - GFP patches might persist at the mem - brane for longer and variable times or that they might move less after leaving the membrane . To test these possibilities , we ﬁrst measured the lifetime of Sla1 - GFP patches at the membrane and found it increased by a substantial amount , more than twofold ( Figure 5 ) . Second , we aligned the MSD plots on the right - hand side before averaging them , i . e . , at the end of their lifetime , to focus on the phase where inward movement normally exists . This analysis showed that the average movement away from the membrane was greatly inhibited by the loss of CP , albeit not completely ( Figure 4 , right ) . To examine phase III , we tracked patches using the actin - binding proteins Abp1 - GFP and Sac6 - GFP . Both markers gave similar results ; only the Abp1 - GFP results are shown here . With MSD plots aligned on the left , CP null mutant strains showed a substantial loss of the concave - up portion of the normal curve ( Figure 4 , left ) . The lifetime of the patches at the membrane was increased , by approximately threefold ( Figure 5 ) . With MSD plots aligned on the right - hand side , to focus on motion at the end of the track , CP null mutant cells showed a substantial decrease in average mo - tion compared with wt cells ( Figure 4 , right ) . The effect of the loss of CP here was less than the effect on patch lifetime or on MSD plots aligned on the left . In addition , the effect of the loss of CP on Abp1 - GFP , with MSD plots aligned on the right , was less than what was seen for Sla1 - GFP . To inves - tigate further the movement of phase III , we tracked Abp1 - GFP patches after they had moved away from the mem - brane , deﬁned by a distance of 200 nm . The average movement was still decreased by the loss of CP , based on MSD plots aligned either on the left or the right before averaging ( Figure 6 ) . When actin - based motility of Listeria was reconstituted from pure proteins in vitro , the curve describing how mo - tility depends on the concentration of CP was bell - shaped , with motility falling off at high and low concentrations ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . This was also the case for ADF / coﬁlin and Arp2 / 3 complex . To test this prediction of the dendritic nucleation model in vivo , we overexpressed the two sub - units of CP , Cap1 and Cap2 , from a bidirectional promoter . We observed strong inhibition of movement , similar to the effect of the loss of CP , based on tracking of Abp1 - GFP Figure 4 . Quantitative analysis of patch motility in the presence and absence of capping protein . Patches labeled with GFP fusions of Abp1 , Sac6 , Sla1 , or Las17 , were tracked in wild - type , cap1 (cid:3) or cap2 (cid:3) cells . In the left panels , each curve is from one independent strain and represents the average of plots from tracks of 25 – 100 patches from four to seven cells . Results from independent strains are plotted to illustrate the level of variability in the results , which is usually low but can be signiﬁcant . For the left panels , tracks of individual patches were aligned on the left side , at the start of their lifetime , before averaging . Plots end at the median lifetime of the patches , i . e . , when half the patches have disappeared , or at 14 s , whichever is less . In the panels on the right , tracks were aligned on their right edges , at the end of their life , to focus on movement away from the membrane . Here , results from independent strains were averaged together . LatA treatment caused a greater inhibition of movement than did the loss of CP in each case , as shown in Figure 1D . The results with Sac6 - GFP were similar to those with Abp1 - GFP and are not shown . Strain numbers were YJC 3481 – 4090 . Figure 5 .

Actin and Endocytosis Vol . 17 , March 2006 1359 patches ( Figure 7 ) . Thus , the concentration of CP in vivo is optimal for actin patch assembly and motility . Patch Motility in the Absence of Actin Cables Cells without CP are known to have a moderate defect in actin cable assembly and polarization ( Karpova et al . , 1998 ) , so we asked whether their cable defect could account for their decrease in patch movement . Actin cables are highly dynamic bundles of ﬁlaments , polymerizing at their ends near the bud tip on a rapid time scale comparable with that of actin patch assembly ( Yang and Pon , 2002 ) . Actin patches are sometimes seen at the ends of cables and vice - versa ( Karpova et al . , 1998 ) . Some actin patches have been ob - served to move along actin cables , seeming to attach to the cable and move rearward as the cable treadmilled ( Huckaba et al . , 2004 ) . We reasoned that the decrease in the number of cables in CP mutant cells might be a contributing factor in the decrease in patch movement . To test this hypothesis , we tracked actin patch assembly and movement with Abp1 - GFP in conditional mutants known to lose actin cables completely and rapidly upon shift to restrictive temperature . We used two formin double mu - tants , bnr1 (cid:3) bni1 - 12 and bnr1 (cid:3) bni1 - 11 ( Evangelista et al . , 2002 ) . Formins nucleate and sustain the polymerization of the actin ﬁlaments in the cable , so that loss of formin func - tion leads to rapid disappearance of cables . We conﬁrmed that these mutants did lose cables rapidly at the restrictive temperature under our conditions , by rhodamine - phalloidin staining ( our unpublished data ) . Surprisingly , tracking actin patches revealed a modest increase of patch motility upon loss of cables , not a decrease ( Figure 8 ) . Thus , a decrease in cables cannot account for the decrease in patch movement in capping protein mutants . Endocytosis with Membrane Markers Because loss of CP inhibited the movement of patches away from the membrane , and patches have been associated with endocytic vesicles as deﬁned by FM4 - 64 labeling ( Huckaba et al . , 2004 ) , we asked whether the loss of CP delayed the transit of FM4 - 64 through the endosomal system in a pulse experiment ( Figure 9A ) . The initial internalization step was delayed in the cap1 (cid:3) mutant , to a degree similar to that seen for sla2 (cid:3) , a positive control endocytosis mutant ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ) , based on the fraction of cells that persist in the initial pattern of ﬂuorescence distribution ( Figure 9B ) . This result conﬁrmed our results with actin patch tracking in the cap - ping protein mutants . In contrast , when examining the timing for the appear - ance of subsequent distribution patterns for the FM4 - 64 ﬂuorescence , the cap1 (cid:3) curve was closer to the wild - type curve than it was to the sla2 (cid:3) curve ( Figure 9 , C and D ) . This result suggested that movement of vesicles to the vacuole might be less affected by the loss of capping protein . We tested this hypothesis directly with time - lapse movies of living cells in which we examined the movement of FM4 - 64 vesicles in the cytoplasm at intermediate times during a pulse label experiment . In wild - type cells , vesicles that were free in the cytoplasm moved rapidly , with frequent sharp turns . In cap1 (cid:3) cells , the vesicle behavior was similar to that of wild - type cells . Tracking analysis and MSD plots showed that cap1 (cid:3) and wild - type vesicles were indistinguishable ( Figure 10A and Movies 3 and 4 ) , supporting the hypothesis . Figure 9 .

The motion of Abp1 - GFP patches was tracked in wild - type , bnr1 (cid:3) , bnr1 (cid:3) bni1 - 11 , and bnr1 (cid:3) bni1 [ hyphen ] 12 cells , at permissive ( 30°C ) and restrictive temperatures ( 35°C ) . Each curve represents the average from (cid:5) 100 patches from eight cells . MSD plots were aligned on the left for averaging .

K . Kim et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1360 The high frequency of turning caused the MSD plots to be linear , characteristic of random paths , as opposed to concave up , characteristic of directed motion . To test the hypothesis further , we asked whether the movement of endocytic vesicles in the cytoplasm labeled in another manner had a similar lack of dependence on CP . The membrane receptor Ste2 is constitutively endocytosed , and Ste2 - GFP can be seen as vesicles moving rapidly though the cytoplasm on their way to the vacuole ( Chang et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . We tracked the movement of Ste2 - GFP vesicles and found no difference between cap1 (cid:3) and wild - type ( Figure 10B and Movies 5 and 6 ) . Therefore , the movement of en - docytic vesicles at a later phase in the endocytic pathway seemed not to depend on capping protein , whereas the movement of early endocytic vesicles did . To explore further the idea that actin patches and Ste2 vesicles move with different mechanisms , we examined the dependence of their movement on Lsb6 , a L a s 17 / WASp b inding protein . Las17 / WASp and Lsb6 were found to be important for the movement of Ste2 - GFP vesicles in the cytoplasm ( Chang et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . Therefore , we tested actin patch motility in an lsb6 (cid:3) null mutant , by Abp1 - GFP tracking . We found no effect of the loss of Lsb6 ( Figure 11 ) , supporting the conclusion that the mechanism of actin - based motility for actin patches differs from that for Ste2 vesicles . DISCUSSION The Dendritic Nucleation Model and Actin Patch Motility Our results here on the role of capping protein in the assem - bly and movement of actin patches support the relevance of the dendritic nucleation model in vivo . The model predicts that capping is not required for actin to assemble on an object or surface but that capping is important for efﬁcient conversion of actin assembly into motion . Our results with actin patches agree with both predictions . First , the loss of capping protein did not affect the initial polymerization of actin at the site of nucleation , where WASp / Las17 presum - ably recruits active Arp2 / 3 complex ( Wen and Rubenstein , 2005 ) . In the absence of capping protein , actin still polymer - ized and components of the actin patch still assembled , as revealed by tracking of WASp / Las17 , endocytic adaptors , and actin - binding proteins . Second , the loss of capping protein did inhibit the move - ment of the endocytic vesicle away from the plasma mem - brane . The ﬁrst motion of the endocytic vesicle away from the plasma membrane , which may correspond to scission , is most readily revealed by tracking endocytic adaptors , such as Sla1 . Here , we saw that Sla1 - GFP motion was severely compromised in capping protein mutants . A small amount of movement was seen but only after a substantial delay . Normally , the endocytic vesicle then moves farther away from the plasma membrane , at a faster speed . Detecting this motion requires tracking actin ﬁlaments , with any of several different actin - binding proteins , such as Abp1 - GFP . The loss of capping protein caused a substantial loss of this motion but not to the degree seen for the initial movement of the vesicle away from the membrane . Even focusing on the ﬁnal phases of motion observed by tracking Abp1 - GFP , we saw less motion in the absence of CP . In a previous article ( Kim et al . , 2004 ) , we reported an analysis of actin patch motion that revealed no difference between wild - type and capping protein null strains . Those studies were limited to the short - range movements of phase I , near the plasma membrane , because only a single z - axis plane at the top of the cell was examined , by confocal microscopy . We see here that phase I movement is not affected by the loss of CP , which is consistent with those previous results . In this study , equatorial planes were se - lected , which reveals motion into the cell interior more clearly . The Molecular Mechanism of Actin - based Movement on Actin Patches versus Ste2 Vesicles Our results reveal differences in the molecular basis of the movement of actin patches , in which endocytic vesicles form Figure 10 .

Similar results were obtained when Ste2 - GFP was expressed from the STE2 endogenous locus in the CAP1 and cap1 (cid:3) haploid strains YJC4384 and YJC4381 , respectively . Figure 11 .

LatA treatment of the wt strain provides a positive control . Aligning the plots on the right also showed no difference between wt and mutant ( our unpublished data ) . The wild - type strain was YJC 2719 . One hundred and ﬁfteen patches were analyzed for the wild - type control , and 64 patches were analyzed for the LatA - treated wild - type sample . For lsb6 (cid:3) , strains YJC 4300 , 4301 , and 4302 were analyzed , with 92 , 118 , and 110 patches per strain , respectively . Actin and Endocytosis Vol . 17 , March 2006 1361 and move away from the plasma membrane , compared with the movement of Ste2 vesicles , in which endocytic vesicles travel through the cytoplasm to the vacuole . In previous studies , both processes were found to depend on actin po - lymerization ( Carlsson et al . , 2002 ; Chang et al . , 2003 ) . Actin patch movement was found to depend on the activity of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) , and Ste2 vesicle move - ment to depend on WASp / Las17 ( Chang et al . , 2003 ) , which binds Arp2 / 3 complex . These results suggest that both movements involve dendritic nucleation of actin assembly by Arp2 / 3 complex . In contrast , actin ﬁlaments and Arp2 / 3 complex have been observed to assemble and move with the actin patch ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) , but actin and Arp2 / 3 complex have not been visualized on Ste2 vesicles ( Chang et al . , 2005 ) . This difference may simply reﬂect the sensitivity of detection methods , with Ste2 vesicles having less F - actin and Arp2 / 3 complex than actin patches do . A more telling dif - ference may be that , in our results , the absence of capping protein inhibited movement of actin patches away from the plasma membrane to a large degree , whereas the movement of Ste2 vesicles in the cytoplasm was not affected by the loss of capping protein . In addition , Lsb6 , a WASp / Las17 inter - actor , which is required for the movement of Ste2 vesicles ( Chang et al . , 2005 ) , was not found to be required for the movement of actin patches here . How do Ste2 vesicles move ? One hypothesis is that their movement is a product of inertia resulting from the force that pushes the vesicle away from the plasma membrane . This model is consistent with the apparent absence of F - actin and Arp2 / 3 complex on the Ste2 vesicle , in that the vesicle would move passively , without the need for an active pro - cess to continuously drive its motion . We view this model as extremely unlikely . First , the Reynolds number for an object of this size moving through an aqueous solution , especially one with the viscosity of cytoplasm , is so low that inertia should be negligible . Second , Ste2 vesicles display sharp turns in the path of their movement through the cytoplasm , which is not predicted by inertial movement , unless one envisions the vesicles striking and bouncing off a larger object . Third , in this model , the same molecular process would power the movement of the early endosome away from the membrane and its subsequent movement through the cytoplasm . To the contrary , we found that early endo - some movement depends on capping protein but not Lsb6 , whereas Ste2 vesicle movement depends on Lsb6 but not capping protein . Thus , the molecular processes seems to be distinct . We favor the hypothesis that F - actin and Arp2 / 3 complex are present on the Ste2 vesicle but below current detection methods . The lack of dependence on capping protein may be rationalized if a relatively low amount of force is required to move a vesicle that is free in the cytoplasm . Dendritic nu - cleation would occur and be less efﬁcient than in the pres - ence of capping protein . That the actin assembly becomes polarized to one side of the vesicle as the vesicle leaves the membrane may enable less efﬁcient assembly to sufﬁce for movement . To move objects in a synthetic system , Arp2 / 3 - based dendritic nucleation needs capping protein to break symmetry and produce force ( Akin and Mullins , personal communication ) , which seems consistent with our in vivo ﬁndings that capping protein is more important in the early stages of vesicle scission and movement . The Nature of the Endocytic Pathway for Ste2 Relatively little is known about whether the pathway taken by a membrane receptor , such as Ste2 , to the vacuole is the same as the pathways revealed by tracking membrane dyes , such as FM4 - 64 , or actin patch components . Here , we ob - served similar results with Ste2 - GFP and FM4 - 64 when we followed the movement of vesicles free in the cytoplasm in the presence and absence of capping protein , consistent with Ste2 following the common pathway . Alternatively , the prospect that a vesicle containing Ste2 would be able to exclude FM4 - 64 is unlikely , and so the Ste2 pathway may represent only a small part of what is observed with FM4 - 64 . It remains possible that Ste2 vesicles form at the plasma membrane at locations distinct from actin patches , as sug - gested by immuno - EM results in which Ste2 at the plasma membrane was localized to foci distinct from actin patches ( Mulholland et al . , 1999 ) . One should note that our experiments involved constitu - tive , not ligand - induced , endocytosis of Ste2 , which is con - sistent with events observed here with Ste2 - GFP represent - ing only a part of the entire endocytic pathway . Relatively little is known regarding the similarity of the molecular mechanisms for constitutive versus ligand - induced endocy - tosis . For Ste2 , both types of endocytosis are known to occur and to depend on phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the same targeting motif ( Hicke and Riezman , 1996 ; Hicke et al . , 1998 ) . In addition , the motility of Ste2 endosomes produced by constitutive as well as ligand - induced endocytosis is defective in las17 (cid:3) VCA mutants ( Chang et al . , 2003 ; Chang and Blumer , unpublished data ) . The Relationship between Actin Cables and Patches An early striking observation about the yeast actin cytoskel - eton was that cables and patches are polarized in the same manner , toward sites of polarized cell growth ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ) . We now under - stand that cables are the tracks for myosin - powered move - ment of secretory vesicles to these sites ( Pruyne et al . , 2004 ) , which explains why cables should be polarized in this man - ner . Actin patches seem to mediate endocytosis , and why endocytosis should occur at the same site as polarized growth is less clear . Perhaps retrieval and recycling of bulk membrane components is more efﬁcient if the uptake occurs near the site of insertion . An alternative hypothesis is that the assembly or move - ment of patches depends on cables . Patches have been ob - served to localize near the ends of cables and to move along cables ( Karpova et al . , 1998 ; Huckaba et al . , 2004 ) . This hy - pothesis predicts that loss of cables should impair patch movement . Capping protein mutants have a moderate loss of cables and a defect in patch movement , which seemed consistent . We tested the prediction by examining patch movement in conditional mutants that lose cables . Formins nucleate the unbranched actin ﬁlaments that compose the cable , so that a formin mutant can lose cables rapidly and completely on shift to restrictive temperature ( Evangelista et al . , 2002 ) . We found that patch motility did not decrease , as predicted , but instead increased in such mutants at restric - tive temperature . We suspect that the rapid disassembly of the actin cables increased the concentration of actin sub - units , which increased the polymerization rate of ﬁlaments growing in the patches and thus the speed of patch move - ment , on average . These results are not inconsistent with a fraction of patches depending on cables for their movement ( Huckaba et al . , 2004 ) , because that fraction may be small . Alternatively , association with a cable may slow patch movement , compared with movement of a free patch . K . Kim et al .
