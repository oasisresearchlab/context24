The organizational pursuit of novelty is generally theorized as necessary for long - term organizational adaptation and survival yet variance increasing in the short term . We argue that the recent explosion of studies of exploration and exploita - tion tend to conceptualize and operationalize novelty quite narrowly . In contrast , we treat novelty as a multidimensional construct and discuss implications of this approach for future research . Key words : exploration and exploitation ; innovation management ; novelty ; organizational learning ; portfolio management History : Published online in Articles in Advance April 11 , 2011 . Introduction Paradoxically , novelty has been portrayed both as a savior and villain in theories of organizational perfor - mance . Although novelty is a critical component of stud - ies of organizational renewal , an organization’s embrace of novelty implies risk and uncertainty , which can inhibit predictable performance ( Benner and Tushman 2003 ) . At the same time , reliable and routine behavior , although proﬁtable in the short term , may impede adaptation nec - essary for changing environments ( Hannan and Freeman 1984 ) . Thus , many examinations of learning and evolu - tion in the ﬁeld of management distinguish novel from routine behavior and consider the antecedents and con - sequences of portfolios of behaviors that vary in their ratios of novel to routine behavior . Conventional wisdom in our ﬁeld suggests that a mod - erate embrace of novelty ( that is , not too novel or too routine across some set of organizational activities ) is critical for organization adaptation and survival , demon - strated deftly by March’s ( 1991 ) simulation of explo - ration and exploitation behaviors . Additional support for this view is generated by a normative literature that celebrates exemplary behaviors by organizations at particular times and contexts ; this literature also pro - poses corresponding managerial practices and prescrip - tions , such as “managing ambidextrously” ( Tushman and O’Reilly 1996 , p . 8 ) , “choreographed transitions” ( Brown and Eisenhardt 1997 , p . 29 ) , or deploying “adap - tation modes” appropriate to “conﬂicting ( and changing ) strategic contingencies” ( Westerman et al . 2006 , p . 237 ) , that might encourage these types of behaviors and their putative outcomes . More recently , the term “organiza - tional ambidexterity” has been applied well beyond the normative literature on management of innovation ; it is also being used to denote some balance of exploration and exploitation in more deductive research . Yet systematic empirical study of multiple organiza - tions over time demonstrates the challenges of maintain - ing some sort of balance between novelty and routine . Indeed , the general tendency of organizations seems to be a drift toward less novel behavior ( Benner and Tushman 2002 , Sørensen and Stuart 2000 ) . Our con - tention in this paper is that organizational research needs to embrace a multidimensional conceptualization of nov - elty to better capture the trade - offs undertaken by orga - nizations in their pursuit ( or avoidance ) of novelty . To develop our argument , we focus on the role of novelty in the organization learning literature , reviewing both its conceptualization and operationalization . Because we contend that the research methods in this area typically shortchange the nuances necessary for thorough under - standing , we both examine these nuances in some recent research and also offer a practice - based illustration . We close with several recommendations for future research . Novelty and Balance in the Organization Learning Literature March’s ( 1991 , p . 71 ) seminal work distinguishing exploration from exploitation offered a host of synonyms for these two concepts : “Exploration includes things captured by terms such as search , variation , risk tak - ing , experimentation , play , ﬂexibility , discovery , inno - vation . Exploitation includes such things as reﬁnement , choice , production , efﬁciency , selection , implementa - tion , execution (cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:48) ” In subsequent work ( Levinthal and March 1993 , p . 105 ) , exploration was deﬁned as “the pursuit of new knowledge” and exploitation as “the use and development of things already known . ” All of these 1297 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 130 . 133 . 8 . 114 ] on 13 M a y 2015 , a t 06 : 03 .

Rosenkopf and McGrath : Conceptualizing and Operationalizing Novelty 1298 Organization Science 22 ( 5 ) , pp . 1297 – 1311 , ©2011 INFORMS synonyms and the deﬁnitions suggest that exploration is associated with the pursuit of novelty , whereas exploita - tion represents less novel , or more routine , behavior . March ( 1991 ) further asserted that exploration yields lower returns than exploitation , on average , because of the higher likelihood of failure for nonroutine behav - ior . At the same time , however , returns to exploration have higher variance than returns to exploration . Thus , when examining the speciﬁc activities through which exploration and exploitation behaviors are enacted , this variance makes it possible that particular exploration activities may outperform exploitation activities . Ulti - mately , then , “an appropriate balance between explo - ration and exploitation is a primary factor in system survival and prosperity” ( March 1991 , p . 71 ) . Representing this balance , the relationship between the level of novelty and performance is then hypothesized to be curvilinear , as shown in Figure 1 . Peak performance is achieved at some moderate level of novelty , n ∗ . The question of what n ∗ might be is an open one . Simu - lations can pinpoint particular values of n ∗ —for exam - ple , Levinthal ( 1997 ) suggested that organizations that make “long jumps” one of every seven times are most effective—but these values are a function of the assump - tions built into the model . In contrast , in an empiri - cal study of alliances , Lin et al . ( 2007 ) conceptualized ambidexterity as an even balance of exploratory and exploitative activities ( i . e . , exploration represents 50 % of the activity ) but empirically operationalized ambidexter - ity as a dichotomous variable valued at 1 when a ﬁrm had between 20 % and 80 % exploration activity . They found that balance is expensive to pursue , and only larger ﬁrms had the resources to generate higher performance from ambidexterity . Although much research has been grounded in March’s ( 1991 ) emphasis on the necessity of balance between exploration and exploitation , the conceptual - ization of balance employed by scholars varies . Some scholars , such as Lavie et al . ( 2010 ) , theorize more of a conﬂict between the two behaviors and accord - ingly will calculate relative levels of each behavior . Figure 1 Expected Performance vs . Novelty 0 N n * E xp ec t e d p e rf o r m a n ce Novelty This continuum - based trade - off is embraced by balance - management approaches like those of the “punctu - ated equilibrium” variety , where exploitation pursuits are “punctuated” by periods of exploration ( Burgelman 2002 ) . In contrast , rather than viewing exploration and exploitation as competing behaviors at opposing ends of a continuous spectrum , they may instead be interpreted as orthogonal dimensions . With this approach , ambidex - terity does not mandate a trade - off of one behavior against the other ; rather , successful organizations can and should attempt exploration and exploitation simul - taneously ( Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004 ) . There are numerous pathways for potentially doing so ( Raisch et al . 2009 ) , including structural approaches that enable different organizational units or areas to have differ - ent objectives ( Benner and Tushman 2003 , Tushman and O’Reilly 1996 ) , or even through processes—such as decentralization of decision - making authority or partic - ipation in cross - functional interfaces—that drive varia - tion in individual - level ambidexterity among managers ( Mom et al . 2009 ) . Furthermore , an organization may simultaneously engage in several of these balancing options to manage exploration – exploitation trade - offs , although multimode empirical research has been limited to date ( Lavie et al . 2010 ) . In their summary of four such questions around the analysis of exploration and exploitation—the clarity of their deﬁnition , the interpretation of their continuity ver - sus orthogonality , the efﬁcacy of ambidextrous versus punctuated equilibrium approaches to balance , and the feasibility of a specialized ( one or the other ) versus a dual organizational focus—Gupta et al . ( 2006 ) con - cluded that context plays an important role in their res - olution . For example , conditions of resource scarcity ( thereby pitting exploration against exploitation ) or con - sideration of a single domain setting ( where the analyses are restricted to an individual or a subsystem ) suggest the mutual exclusivity of the continuum model . The empirical study by Puranam et al . ( 2006 ) of postacquisi - tion innovation outcomes in the information technology hardware industry highlighted the importance of context . Their ﬁndings showed that , although both are impor - tant for innovation , the relative need for exploration or exploitation depends on the stage of the acquired ﬁrm’s technological trajectory , and therefore structural integra - tion choices should be made accordingly . On the other hand , contexts that are rich in resources or encompass multiple different or loosely coupled domains suggest the orthogonal interpretation . Cao et al . ( 2009 ) simi - larly found that ﬁrms in resource - rich environments can and should simultaneously pursue both exploration and exploitation , but those ﬁrms that are resource constrained beneﬁt from making trade - offs between the two . Given the central role of context , it is unsurprising that despite the plethora of recent research on explo - ration and exploitation in organization learning , clear D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 130 . 133 . 8 . 114 ] on 13 M a y 2015 , a t 06 : 03 .

Rosenkopf and McGrath : Conceptualizing and Operationalizing Novelty Organization Science 22 ( 5 ) , pp . 1297 – 1311 , ©2011 INFORMS 1299 generalizability of these ﬁndings can be difﬁcult because of the inherent speciﬁcity of the various empirical set - tings examined . In other words , any ideal ratio of explo - ration to exploitation is likely to vary from one industry context to another , as is one ﬁrm - speciﬁc set of prac - tices to another . Furthermore , generalizability and com - parisons between studies are hampered by researchers’ use of different measures to operationalize the concepts of exploration , exploitation , and / or ambidexterity ( Cao et al . 2009 , Lavie et al . 2010 ) . Table 1 provides a high - level overview of sev - eral survey - based studies in the exploration – exploitation arena . Because of the ample number of studies available , we focused our selection on papers that have been high - lighted in journal special issues and reviews ( see Gupta et al . 2006 , Raisch and Birkinshaw 2008 , Raisch et al . 2009 ) . We targeted papers conducted at the organization level of analysis to provide a point of methodological commonality . However , even in this small collection , dif - ferences in operationalizations—and thus difﬁculties in generalizability—are apparent . Empirical settings vary from high - tech in California to packaged food in The Netherlands to ﬁnancial services in Europe . Moreover , these papers display fundamental differences in their approaches to exploration and exploitation , both theoret - ical ( continuum or orthogonal ) and operational ( innova - tion , marketing , sourcing , or strategy ) . To wit , consider the Jansen et al . ( 2009 ) survey of executives in a ran - dom , multi - industry sample of 230 private ﬁrms . The authors viewed exploration and exploitation as orthog - onal dimensions , choosing ( based on regression results with performance as the dependent variable ) to measure ambidexterity by summing their study’s constructs of “exploratory innovation” and “exploitative innovation . ” Their exploratory innovation measure tracked the level to which ﬁrms pursued radical innovations for new cus - tomers ( therefore departing from existing knowledge ) , whereas their exploitative innovation measure tracked the degree to which the ﬁrms pursued incremental inno - vations for current customers ( therefore building on existing knowledge ) . Both survey measures were based on scales developed previously by the authors ( Jansen et al . 2006 ) . Compare this to Rothaermel and Alexandre’s ( 2009 ) survey study . Whereas both studies used the frame of an organization’s search for knowledge with an orthogonal interpretation of explore – exploit , Rothaer - mel and Alexandre ( 2009 ) applied the ambidexterity lens to ﬁrms’ technology - sourcing strategies—a very dif - ferent approach from the Jansen et al . ( 2009 ) prod - uct innovation perspective . Moreover , Rothaermel and Alexandre ( 2009 ) considered two distinct dimensions where trade - offs stemming from a ﬁrm’s concurrent pursuit of exploration and exploitation could occur : ( 1 ) organizational boundaries ( i . e . , whether technol - ogy sourcing takes place internal or external to the ﬁrm ) and ( 2 ) technological boundaries ( i . e . , whether the sourced technology is new , and thus explorative , or known to the ﬁrm , and thus exploitative ) . This then leads to four exploration – exploitation combinations for evaluation : internal exploration ( a ﬁrm’s sourcing new technology from internal sources ) , external exploration ( new technology sourced externally ) , internal exploita - tion ( known technology sourced internally ) , and exter - nal exploitation ( known technology sourced externally ) . These organizational – technological pairings are exam - ined in the analysis , as opposed to the more singular focus of Jansen et al . ( 2009 ) on their additive ambidex - terity measure . To collect the data for their explore – exploit independent variables , Rothaermel and Alexandre ( 2009 ) asked survey respondents to provide the percent - age of each technology type ( new or known ) that the ﬁrm sourced internally versus externally . Thus , they used their survey to pointedly ask a quantitatively oriented ques - tion , whereas the inquiries posed by Jansen et al . ( 2009 , p . 809 ) were more qualitative ( e . g . , “We frequently utilize new opportunities in new markets” ) . Moreover , although both papers surveyed ﬁrm executives in random , multi - industry samples , differences such as private ( Jansen et al . 2009 ) versus public ( Rothaermel and Alexandre 2009 ) ﬁrms might need to accounted for by researchers aiming to build on these papers . As these survey studies illustrate , direct comparisons between construct operationalizations can be challeng - ing , and results may be difﬁcult to generalize beyond their speciﬁc empirical settings . Variation stems from the myriad of methodological choices researchers must make . A wide range of issues—such as construct deﬁ - nition , the nature and number of scale items , and data aggregation—all represent potential points of deviation . Given the plausible sensitivity of research results to each of these alternatives , the combined ramiﬁcations of a full suite of decisions are not insigniﬁcant . The cascading impact of these method decisions is empha - sized by Lavie et al . ( 2010 ) , who argued that scholars’ inconsistencies in just a single choice—ambidexterity operationalization—are so pernicious empirically that they recommend using the explore – exploit continuum model as a theoretical basis to allow researchers to bypass these challenges . Moreover , the research method itself can lead to reli - ability concerns . For survey studies , and for those con - cerning multidimensional constructs like ambidexterity or novelty in particular , construct validity may be threat - ened by issues like common method bias and single - informant bias ( Podsakoff and Organ 1986 , Spector 2006 ) . Certainly , there are established methodological procedures for addressing the potential issues associated with these biases . For example , in the study referenced previously , Jansen et al . ( 2009 ) temporarily separated the independent and dependent variables in their sur - veys , and they also gathered data at two different points D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 130 . 133 . 8 . 114 ] on 13 M a y 2015 , a t 06 : 03 .

Similar steps were taken by Rothaermel and Alexandre ( 2009 ) . To defend against single - informant bias , both sets of authors checked inter - rater reliability by surveying additional managers within the same sampled ﬁrms . Although these illustrative approaches are sound ones , concerns surrounding chal - lenges like common method bias often cannot be fully ruled out , and thus any resultant limitations to a study’s potency must be acknowledged . As we move from survey - based research to large - sample archival research , even fewer systematic ﬁndings about the antecedents of exploration and exploitation have been identiﬁed . For example , Beckman et al . ( 2004 ) suggested that larger ﬁrms are more exploratory , whereas Rothaermel and Deeds ( 2004 ) suggested that larger ﬁrms are more exploitative . We argue here that most large - scale empirical studies of exploration and exploitation tend to use a single dimension on which they discrim - inate the amount of novelty versus the amount of rou - tine inherent in an activity . Indeed , although both Beck - man et al . ( 2004 ) and Rothaermel and Deeds ( 2004 ) focused on the mechanism of alliance formation to examine exploration and exploitation , the contexts in which they examined the alliance mechanism differed . Speciﬁcally , Beckman et al . ( 2004 ) distinguished explo - ration from exploitation by examining whether alliances were formed with new versus prior partners , whereas Rothaermel and Deeds ( 2004 ) distinguished exploration from exploitation by examining whether alliances were formed for research and development ( R & D ) versus commercialization purposes . Thus , divergent contexts for classifying alliances as exploratory or exploitative can easily generate divergent ﬁndings . To address this concern , Lavie and Rosenkopf ( 2006 ) included both of these contexts for evaluating novelty in alliance formation decisions simultaneously . Speciﬁ - cally , they classiﬁed each alliance formation decision as exploratory in the “functional domain” if it was an R & D alliance and exploratory in the “structural domain” if it was formed with a new partner . This approach demon - strated divergent predictors of exploration across these two contexts and also clariﬁed that ﬁrms trade off one type of exploration against the other . Conceptually , this implies that novelty exposure over two contexts is addi - tive : if the optimal level of novelty is represented as n ∗ , then n 1 + n 2 = n ∗ ( see Figure 2 ) . However , in subse - quent work , Lavie et al . ( 2011 ) suggested that certain solutions along this line may be more effective . Speciﬁ - cally , by modeling the interaction between the two lev - els ( n 1 × n 2 (cid:53) , they found that developing balance within each context ( that is , n 1 = n 2 = n ∗ / 2 ) decreases per - formance , which implies that n 1 should be signiﬁcantly higher than n 2 , or vice versa . They attribute this ﬁnding to the costs of managing resource conﬂicts and develop - ing routines for this purpose , because the result is driven by larger ﬁrms . Figure 2 Novelty Exposure Over Two Contexts 0 n 1 n * n * n 2 Operationalizing Novelty : Mechanisms and Contexts Researchers seeking to analyze the effects of explo - ration and exploitation activities typically operational - ize novelty via two empirical design choices . First , a mechanism ( or “process” ) that provides or demonstrates exposure to new knowledge is chosen . Thus , as seen in Figure 3 , any activity , be it for learning , innova - tion , or other strategic behavior , should be recognized as the application of a speciﬁc mechanism in a par - ticular context . Although our example directly above utilized alliances as the mechanism , other common approaches include ( but are not limited to ) activities such as patents resulting from internal R & D ( Sørensen and Stuart 2000 , Benner and Tushman 2003 ) , acquisitions ( Puranam et al . 2006 , Vermeulen and Barkema 2001 ) , and mobility ( Rosenkopf and Almeida 2003 , Groysberg and Lee 2009 ) , or new product development ( Danneels 2002 , Katila and Chen 2008 ) . Of course , most studies in the management litera - ture tend to evaluate the effectiveness of one type of learning or innovation mechanism , with other mecha - nisms included at best as controls . For example , Lavie et al . ( 2011 ) examined the effects of alliance portfo - lios in depth while employing control variables for other mechanisms such as acquisitions ( via a yearly count ) and internal R & D ( measured by R & D intensity ) . Such an approach begins to grapple with alternative mecha - nisms for learning , and in turn performance , but it can - Figure 3 Operationalizing Novelty Novelty of the activity Context of the activity ( technical and social ) Mechanism ( s ) of the activity D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 130 . 133 . 8 . 114 ] on 13 M a y 2015 , a t 06 : 03 .

Rosenkopf and McGrath : Conceptualizing and Operationalizing Novelty Organization Science 22 ( 5 ) , pp . 1297 – 1311 , ©2011 INFORMS 1303 not acknowledge the interactions between these resource allocations as forms of balance . Although there may be multiple effective strategies for balancing exploration and exploitation across these multiple mechanisms , a study design of this type does not classify exploration and exploitation for the controlled mechanisms , and therefore it cannot address overall exposure to novelty . Given the design choice about which mechanism ( s ) to feature in the study , each application of this mecha - nism can then be classiﬁed as more or less novel based on some context ( or “landscape” or “space” or “dimen - sion” ) by which the focal mechanism can be compared with past activity to assess novelty or familiarity . Fam - ilies of various constructs and operationalizations used in the literature to distinguish novelty from routine tend to congregate in both technical and social contexts . As described in more detail below , technical context cap - tures the novelty manifest in an innovation itself or in its application , whereas the novelty of social context is demarcated through intra - and interorganizational rela - tionships . We discuss each in turn . Technical Context Several varied approaches have been used to indi - cate whether the knowledge rooted in products or ser - vices is similar to or different from knowledge demon - strated previously by the ﬁrm . For example , Katila and Chen ( 2008 ) examined four different user - focused prod - uct attributes ( repeatability , speed , load capacity , and degrees of freedom ) to assess the novelty of new product introductions in the robotics industry . In their empirical study of incumbent ﬁrm entry into new market niches in the disk drive industry , King and Tucci ( 2002 ) charac - terized a ﬁrm’s experience by separating it into two cat - egories : static experience ( i . e . , in production and sales to existing markets ) and transformational experience ( i . e . , with major change ) . At the same time , by focusing on the customers tar - geted for the new product or service , we can usually discern whether the new product or service will serve the same markets as the organization’s prior ones or markets previously unserved by the focal organization . Levinthal ( 1998 ) argued that “speciation , ” or the appli - cation of familiar technology to a new market domain , is a key source of innovation . Sorenson et al . ( 2006 ) discussed the riskiness of niche expansion and demon - strated the dynamics of sorting industries into generalists versus specialists . A related way of considering technical context can be observed in the strategy literature on alliances . Here , exploration has been distinguished from exploitation by focusing on the function of the alliance : R & D alliances tend to be classiﬁed as exploration , whereas commer - cialization alliances tend to be classiﬁed as exploitation ( e . g . , Koza and Lewin 1998 , Rothaermel 2001 ) . Thus , the position of an alliance on the value chain may be an indicator of the novelty a focal ﬁrm can experience . Another manifestation of technical context , which is sometimes termed “technology space” or the “techno - logical landscape , ” is obtained by examining the patent portfolios of ﬁrms . As patents serve as basic building blocks around which products and services are con - structed , researchers can assess whether newly issued patents represent incremental extensions to the existing knowledge base or more radical departures ( cf . Sørensen and Stuart 2000 , Rosenkopf and Nerkar 2001 , Katila and Ahuja 2002 ) . This assessment can be made in var - ied ways ; for example , researchers can examine whether new patents reside in the same classes as prior ones or whether they cite other patents in familiar or unfamiliar areas . Other research on knowledge building has examined whether the knowledge incorporated in an innovation is contemporaneous or more distantly produced ; in this regard , time offers a potential proxy for technical con - text . Studies that rigorously examine temporal issues have unfortunately been limited , and their results vary . Nerkar ( 2003 ) suggested that patents with citations that range in age yield more impact , whereas Katila ( 2002 ) suggested that the use of older patents is helpful across industries but harmful within industries . The general criticism that a temporal lens is underrepresented in research ( Ancona et al . 2001 , Mitchell and James 2001 ) is clearly applicable in this ﬁeld as well . Social Context One form of social context rests on organizational boundaries . Thus , we can examine whether the activ - ity involves only the focal organization or draws upon other organizations . For example , Rosenkopf and Nerkar ( 2001 ) distinguished between patent citations to the patenting ﬁrm versus other ﬁrms , implying that knowl - edge already possessed by the ﬁrm would represent more familiar territory , whereas incorporating knowledge pos - sessed by other ﬁrms would represent more novelty . Such an approach is also implicit in the analyses of learning from experience within ﬁrms , franchise chains , and industries at large ( cf . Darr et al . 1995 , Ingram and Baum 1997 ) . Geographic space is another proxy for novelty’s social context , where it is assumed that local contexts are familiar and distant contexts are unfamiliar . For exam - ple , Rosenkopf and Almeida ( 2003 ) argue that alliances with or mobility from ﬁrms in distant regions are more likely to provide exposure to nonredundant technological know - how . In a large - scale , longitudinal empirical anal - ysis using U . S . patents from 1975 to 1996 , Singh ( 2005 ) examined the interplay between interpersonal networks ( determined by inventor collaboration across patents ) and geography in patterns of knowledge ﬂow .

Rosenkopf and McGrath : Conceptualizing and Operationalizing Novelty 1304 Organization Science 22 ( 5 ) , pp . 1297 – 1311 , ©2011 INFORMS boundaries restrict knowledge diffusion , Singh further showed that the distance challenges posed to knowledge ﬂow in interﬁrm and interregion contexts may be tem - pered by strong network ties ( represented through previ - ous inventor collaborations ) . Also using patent citation data to represent knowl - edge , Phene et al . ( 2006 ) examined how a ﬁrm’s external knowledge—speciﬁcally , from outside its technological and geographic boundaries—affects its ability to develop breakthrough innovations . Set in the U . S . biotechnol - ogy industry in 1998 , their study considers the impact of four types of knowledge deﬁned by technological areas and national boundaries—speciﬁcally , technolog - ically proximate knowledge of national origin , techno - logically proximate knowledge of international origin , technologically distant knowledge of national origin , and technologically distant knowledge of international ori - gin . In demonstrating different effects ( ranging from curvilinear to positive to no impact ) on breakthrough innovations for different combinations of technological and geographic knowledge characteristics , this research underscores the need to critically consider multiple dimensions of novelty , including geography . Interestingly , although more scholars need to embed a multidimensional approach in their work , Feinberg and Gupta’s ( 2004 ) paper indicates that the importance of geography’s role , and its interplay with other con - textual characteristics , has not been lost on practition - ers . They showed that a multinational ﬁrm’s decision to locate R & D responsibilities in its foreign subsidiaries is shaped by the ﬁrm’s assessment of the potential for knowledge spillover opportunities in the host country , in combination with the ﬁrm’s internal capabilities for uti - lizing that knowledge both locally and globally . Thus , the U . S . - based multinational ﬁrms in their sample , when formulating their R & D strategies , appear to take a multi - faceted view of context—with a thorough consideration of geography—when assessing their abilities to capture knowledge and comprehensively utilize it . Another form of social context , as we have foreshad - owed with the discussion of alliance formation deci - sions above , considers the relationships themselves as the learning activities ( Kogut and Zander 1992 ) and evaluates them with respect to the preexisting network of relationships . Thus , alliance research in the more organization - theoretic or network tradition focuses on whether an alliance is formed with a repeat ( prior ) part - ner or a new partner ( Beckman et al . 2004 ) . Here , alliances with repeat partners are presumed to gener - ate less exposure to overall novelty , because prior part - ners have developed joint routines , previous exposure to each other’s knowledge , effective governance , and trust . A new partnership , in contrast , requires more substan - tive management of all these issues ( Dyer and Singh 1998 ) . Relatedly , albeit in an intraorganizational empiri - cal setting , this echoes Gibson and Birkinshaw’s ( 2004 ) empirical approach to measuring organizational context . In this study , their “social context” variable represented a combination of the “support” and “trust” attributes dis - played by 41 business units in 10 multinational ﬁrms . Multiple Contexts and Multiple Mechanisms As might be expected , the operating realities of many ﬁrms necessarily cause them to leverage multiple mech - anisms within multiple contexts concurrently . The ensu - ing complexity may be readily imagined , giving cre - dence to our position of the importance of treating novelty as a multidimensional construct . Although it is our view that research studies need to aggressively take on this challenge more frequently , one management arena that has made signiﬁcant strides in this direction is the entrepreneurship literature , particularly in their consideration of business models . Although the lexi - cons are different , there are strong similarities between entrepreneurship - based discussions of business model innovations and our treatment of novel activities . As deﬁned by Amit and Zott ( 2001 , p . 511 ) , a business model describes “the content , structure , and governance of transactions designed so as to create value through the exploitation of business opportunities . ” The authors subsequently explain how , given the linkage between transactions and activities , that a business model may be equivalently characterized as a system of activities that is enabled by the focal ﬁrm and directed toward total value creation for all network constituents—for the focal ﬁrm itself and for the customers , suppliers , and partners external to the ﬁrm’s boundaries—as well as toward value appropriation for the focal ﬁrm ( Zott and Amit 2010 ) . Framed in terms of activity systems , Zott and Amit ( 2010 ) explained that an important set of the business model’s design parameters is encompassed by three design elements : what activities are selected , or content ; how the activities are linked and prioritized , or structure ; and who performs the activities , or gov - ernance . Thus , their characterization of business model innovation notably takes both mechanism and context into consideration . This interpretation of business model innovation recognizes and capitalizes on the multidimen - sionality of novelty . Modeling Novelty In contrast to the empirical studies rooted in archival data , organizational scholars have used a variety of sim - ulation models to demonstrate both the traps of local search and the beneﬁts of occasional outreach . Most common in the recent literature are the NK models bor - rowed from Kauffman ( 1993 ) . The beauty of the NK model is its ﬂexibility to represent multiple dimensions simultaneously . Researchers set the number of relevant dimensions ( N ) and represent an organization’s posi - tion as an N - dimensional vector , where each entry is a D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 130 . 133 . 8 . 114 ] on 13 M a y 2015 , a t 06 : 03 . F o r p e r s o n a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . Rosenkopf and McGrath : Conceptualizing and Operationalizing Novelty Organization Science 22 ( 5 ) , pp . 1297 – 1311 , ©2011 INFORMS 1305 binary value . Given an organization’s current position in N - space , the novelty of an alternative position is then the number of dimensions that differ from the current position . A challenge for the application of this model to prac - tice or empirical research is that it is essentially agnostic about the primacy of any particular dimension . The NK model’s treatment of these multidimensional landscapes is blind to any nuances among the N dimensions deter - mining novelty across the N - space . Interdependence is distributed evenly across all dimensions , so no dimen - sion appears more salient than any other . Speciﬁcally , the parameter K indicates the extent to which “neigh - boring” dimensions simultaneously determine expected performance . Complexity , meaning the extent to which returns associated with any one dimension are affected by other dimensions , is denoted by K . In general , more complex landscapes have more idiosyncratic per - formance characteristics that are harder to understand using only local search ( Levinthal 1997 ) . In the organizational learning literature , the chosen value of N seems to vary between 4 and 24 ( e . g . , Rivkin 2000 ) , with much of the work of Levinthal and col - leagues ( cf . Levinthal 1997 , Gavetti and Levinthal 2000 ) in the smaller range of 6 to 10 . Recognizing the inabil - ity of social actors to process 10 dimensions effectively , Gavetti and Levinthal ( 2000 ) examined how “cognition” ( deﬁned as the ability to perceive a subset ( three ) of their 10 landscape dimensions ) affects search . Tellingly , they demonstrated that actors that periodically were able to change their cognitions ( i . e . , release the emphasis on current dimensions and replace it with an emphasis on new dimensions ) achieved the highest performance , sug - gesting the importance of reorienting approaches to nov - elty periodically . Our emphasis on the NK model , and on model - ing novelty in simulation studies more broadly , is not intended to be a singular prescription . Indeed , there are intriguing alternatives that researchers may leverage to capture and study the multidimensionality of novelty . One such alternative for operationalizing and analyzing novelty as a multidimensional construct is through set theory . Set - theoretic methods have been compellingly applied in the realm of organization conﬁgurations ( Fiss 2007 ) and across social science ( Ragin 2007 ) . In apply - ing a set - theoretic approach to novelty , mechanisms and contexts could be treated as sets rather than as disaggregated independent variables . Their numerous conﬁgurations combine to create different novel out - comes . Treating novelty as a qualitative outcome that is calibrated rather than measured , where the nature of the novel outcome is a consequence of the particular case’s combinations of attributes , offers some power - ful capabilities that conventional approaches may not . For example , set theory is well equipped to address the phenomenon of equiﬁnality , in which two or more con - ﬁgurations may be equally effective at achieving a par - ticular state of novelty . Likewise , set theory methods can assist researchers in unpacking situations of “lim - ited diversity”—those situations where certain combina - tions of mechanisms and contexts might be infrequently observed or perhaps wholly unobserved in practice . Managing Innovation by Moderating Novelty Exposure : Perspectives from Practice The commercial reality that practitioners inhabit is inher - ently and unavoidably multidimensional . The better that managers are able to address multiple dimensions in their thinking and approach to novelty , the better they are positioned for sensible , successful decision making . As such , numerous tools and processes have been devel - oped that encourage managers to comprehensively con - sider the multidimensional character of novelty in their working realities , instead of simply ﬁxating on only one or two dimensions . These approaches have origi - nated from academia ( such as Roberts and Berry’s 1985 framework for entering new businesses , Wheelwright and Clark’s 1992 aggregate project planning , McGrath and MacMillan’s 2000 opportunity matrix ) and from consultants ( such as McKinsey’s 3 horizons framework ; see Baghai et al . 1999 ) , as well as from the industry players themselves . General Electric ( GE ) 1 provides one example of a practice - developed approach to managing the multidi - mensional nature of novelty . By necessity , GE must con - sider its exposure to novelty as it pursues innovation against the backdrop of its wide business and geographic scope . One way that GE facilitates innovation commu - nication and coordination within and between business units is by means of a tool named “the GE Innova - tion 9 - Blocker” ( Figure 4 , adapted from GE as per End - note 1 ) , a matrix that modiﬁes Day’s ( 2007 ) framework . The GE Innovation 9 - Blocker follows in the tradition of well - known normative models in the management of innovation literature , 2 categorizing innovation along two Figure 4 The GE Innovation 9 - Blocker Box 1 ( core ) Box 2 ( adjacent ) Box 3 ( new ) Current GE business model Adjacent GE business model New GE business model C u rr e n t G E s p ace A d j ace n t G E s p a ce N e w G E s p ace D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 130 . 133 . 8 . 114 ] on 13 M a y 2015 , a t 06 : 03 .

The x axis represents whether the business model is routine ( “current” ) for GE , versus extended ( “adjacent” ) or fully novel ( “new” ) . To illustrate , con - sider how this could potentially be applied to one of GE’s business units , such as NBC Universal . Revenue realized with an advertiser’s purchase of a 30 - second commercial spot on its network is a routine business model for NBC , one that is well known and has been well honed over decades . An adjacency to this core case could be exem - pliﬁed by the “product placement” approach , wherein an advertiser pays NBC to have its product woven into the content of a television show . In this business model adjacency , note that the attributes of the “space” dimen - sion ( explained more fully below ) remain essentially the same—the end - user audience , the geographic reach of the broadcast , and the program product itself are all held constant . Last , an innovation leap from the incremen - tal type that typically characterizes activity in the core business ( i . e . , the routine , familiar , well - honed business “engine” ) into the fully novel regime might be charac - terized by money made via online downloads . In one potential expression of this wholly new approach , end consumers directly pay NBC a per - episode fee for down - loading from the company’s virtual storefront . Likewise , the y axis represents whether the “space” ( which can be interpreted as the customer “offering , ” be it a product or service , for a given set of end users in a speciﬁc geography ) is current , adjacent , or new . Hence , this characterization of space combines elements of the technical and social contexts we deﬁned above . The combination of business model and space con - structs results in a 3 × 3 structure with nine possible cases , which GE then compacts into three “boxes” ( indi - cated by the shading of the nine blocks ) . The origin anchors the framework in the “Box 1” type of inno - vation , which is focused on the unit’s current opera - tions . Traversing the matrix from lower left to upper right , one next encounters “Box 2” innovation . In this arena of core business adjacencies , the core’s bound - aries are pushed along one , two , or several innova - tion attributes . Box 3 represents the outermost ring of the matrix . Box 3 innovation , known colloquially as “whitespace” or “big - swing” innovation , is characterized by its material novelty to GE across the vast majority of innovation dimensions . Broadly speaking , Box 1 innova - tions typically address performance gaps and gains in an incremental fashion , whereas Boxes 2 and 3 innovations attack increasingly radical opportunities . Two features of this innovation matrix’s structure merit special consideration . First , note that the y axis concept of space actually projects ( at least ) four dimen - sions on which novelty might be assessed ( product , tech - nology , end - user market , and geography ) into a single dimension . Conceptually , this might mean that each of these dimensions are essentially substitutable for one another or that there are threshold levels of novelty for each of these dimensions that are independent of each other . Pragmatically , this could suggest that incorporat - ing more than two dimensions may have been viewed by the organization as unnecessarily complex for its needs . Yet , at the same time , there does appear to be a minimum level of complexity required to ensure that the frame - work sufﬁciently represents the reality of the working environment . This is illustrated by the second structural feature of the matrix that deserves extra emphasis—its 3 × 3 design ( and thus the three - box construct that it enables ) . Given that a simpler 2 × 2 structure could have been used , this suggests that the 3 × 3 choice was delib - erate . One impetus behind the selection could be that the 3 × 3 construction encourages more comprehensive decision making regarding the composition of the inno - vation portfolio , especially when compared to the cruder guidance that the 2 × 2 structure intrinsically offers . The 3 × 3 design diverts managers away from binary assess - ments ( i . e . , novel / not novel ) and instead forces a mul - tifaceted consideration of an innovation opportunity’s novelty level—not only on the stand - alone basis of a single project but also in terms of that project’s rel - ative contribution to the novelty level of the holistic portfolio . Therefore , it appears that the ﬂexibility in portfolio representation provided by the 3 × 3 frame out - weighs its additional complexity cost over the elemen - tary 2 × 2 design . When used as innovation portfolio management tools , constructs like these may provide a forcing function for balance between novelty and routine in practice . Left to their own devices , driven by the typical incen - tive structures and pressures for surer - bet , shorter - term results , managers might choose quite rationally to focus on Box 1 exclusively . Yet the presence of Boxes 2 and 3 , with the implied accountability associated with them , encourages managers to break from Box 1’s gravitational pull and apply resources to projects across the matrix . Indeed , it is an understandably unnatural act for an indi - vidual manager to concurrently maintain both incremen - tal and ( potentially cannibalizing ) radical innovations in the same portfolio . For such a balancing act to succeed , norms must be established and activity monitored at the corporate level , as highlighted in the more normative lit - erature discussed earlier . Implications for Research We call for several additional directions in research that can bridge the gaps between research , models , and prac - tice . Speciﬁcally , we exhort empirical researchers to incorporate more contextual nuances and more portfolio effects in their analyses of the pursuit of novelty and its associated effects . Incorporating More Multidimensionality in Context Given the existing tendency in empirical research to simplify context , we see opportunities for substantial D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 130 . 133 . 8 . 114 ] on 13 M a y 2015 , a t 06 : 03 .

Rosenkopf and McGrath : Conceptualizing and Operationalizing Novelty Organization Science 22 ( 5 ) , pp . 1297 – 1311 , ©2011 INFORMS 1307 contribution via the incorporation of additional contex - tual nuances as well as typical contexts important for practice . First , for a given context discriminating novelty and routine , there may be ways to further distinguish the degree of novelty inherent in particular activities . As we have discussed , researchers frequently classify knowledge building in patents by sorting the citations contained in these patents into self - citations versus cita - tions to other entities ( e . g . , Sørensen and Stuart 2000 , Rosenkopf and Nerkar 2001 ) . However , Benner and Tushman ( 2002 ) reﬁned this distinction of knowledge within and outside the ﬁrm by assuming that only the ﬁrst citation of another ﬁrm’s patent should represent exploration , whereas subsequent uses would be consid - ered exploitation . This distinction between a new cita - tion to another ﬁrm denoting novelty versus either a self - citation or a “repeat” citation as more exploita - tive addresses only two cells of the 2 × 2 structure that includes the distinctions of self - versus non - self - citation and initial citation versus repeat citation . Con - sidering all four cells in this 2 × 2 structure would raise the questions of whether a ﬁrm’s ﬁrst citation of its own patent has similar or different antecedents or out - comes than repeat citations of that same patent . Like - wise , researchers should question the extent to which treatments considering repeat uses of other ﬁrms’ patents versus only the ﬁrst use might differ . More signiﬁcantly , we need to recognize that stud - ies such as Sørensen and Stuart ( 2000 ) and Benner and Tushman ( 2002 ) focus on the balance of exploration and exploitation as their outcome , and this balance is denoted via attention to one context at a time . Each of these organization - theoretic papers is content to note that ﬁrms are tending toward exploitation of their own tech - nologies , whereas consideration of the broader issues of application of these technologies and value captured in this way , which bears important relevance to practition - ers , is deemphasized . Are we able to incorporate how novelty might be pursued in functional or geographic markets even when these ﬁrms are becoming technolog - ically more myopic and address the performance impli - cations of these choices for ﬁrms ? Indeed , Adner and Levinthal ( 2008 ) suggested that what we perceive as entrepreneurship occurs because a ﬁrm applies knowl - edge in a new dimension that is familiar to them but unfamiliar to others in the space . Thus , what appears novel and exploratory to the naïve observer is actually more exploitative for the entrepreneur . As discussed earlier , Lavie and Rosenkopf ( 2006 ) and Lavie et al . ( 2011 ) demonstrated that by classi - fying alliances as exploratory or exploitative by both functional and structural contexts , ﬁrms then appear to trade off function - based and structure - based exploration . This suggests that classiﬁcations rooted in one context may mask important variation that can lead to inap - propriate prescriptions for managers and again demon - strates the need for simultaneous consideration of multi - ple contexts . Furthermore , they ﬁnd that balance within one domain is not associated with higher performance , whereas balance across the two domains is . This sug - gests that the cost of developing routines to simultane - ously support novelty and routine is high and that ﬁrms might consider their overall exposure to novelty across multiple domains . Indeed , their analysis of performance suggests that ﬁrms that balance across the two domains rather than within each domain achieve higher perfor - mance . It is also noteworthy that their ﬁndings may well indicate that managers already are perceiving and simul - taneously considering both of these dimensions . More generally , researchers need to identify which families of contexts , or which speciﬁc measures within contexts , dominate observed outcomes , as well as when this happens . Ahuja and Lampert ( 2001 ) suggested that organizations fall victim to three “traps”—familiarity , maturity , and propinquity . Certainly , in practice , man - agers could succumb to these traps in both the techni - cal and the social contexts we have discussed above . Of course , meta - analyses of extant studies and ongoing studies may allow better speciﬁcation of these families as well as guiding researchers toward key measures that should be included in any study of this type . Little evidence exists to help researchers and prac - titioners speculate on the ideal value of n ∗ , or the ways in which novelty exposure actors domains may aggregate . The Lavie et al . ( 2011 ) approach suggests that novelty in different domains may be substitutive . In a different approach , Sorenson and Stuart ( 2001 ) have suggested that familiarity in one domain can over - come distance in another . Speciﬁcally , their work on venture capital syndicates demonstrates that although syndicate membership is generally predicted by geo - graphic or industrial proximity of their targets , venture capitalists become more likely to fund distant targets when another venture capitalist that they have previously invested with is participating in the syndicate . In this way , social ties are posited to contract distance . Simi - larly , Rosenkopf and Almeida ( 2003 ) demonstrated that both alliances and mobility increase the likelihood of semiconductor ﬁrms learning from each other when they are technologically distant . To what extent might our low - dimensional classiﬁcations of similarity versus dis - tance contract when additional mechanisms promoting familiarity are incorporated ? At the same time , Alcácer and Zhao ( 2006 ) approached this issue from the oppo - site viewpoint , demonstrating that semiconductor ﬁrms opening R & D facilities in new geographic regions tend to pursue R & D that is less similar to neighboring facili - ties . They hypothesized that this is a strategic choice to maximize inbound knowledge spillovers while minimiz - ing outbound ones . Clearly , more research is needed to understand these complementary effects . D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 130 . 133 . 8 . 114 ] on 13 M a y 2015 , a t 06 : 03 .

Rosenkopf and McGrath : Conceptualizing and Operationalizing Novelty 1308 Organization Science 22 ( 5 ) , pp . 1297 – 1311 , ©2011 INFORMS Taking a more microlevel perspective on the consider - ation of multiple dimensions of novelty , studies focusing more explicitly on product innovation have examined varied characteristics of these products . For example , Katila and Chen ( 2008 ) utilized a continuous measure of the novelty of a new industrial automation product , derived by averaging improvement in the four distinct product dimensions such as repeatability , speed , load capacity , and degrees of freedom . Like the NK models discussed previously , this approach is agnostic about the role of any particular dimension as well as any particular interdependence among dimensions . It raises the inter - esting issue of whether and when ﬁrms choose to prior - itize certain dimensions as well as address new ones . Portfolio Effects Recognizing the uncertainty inherent in any given inno - vation attempt , much of the literature on the manage - ment of innovation focuses on a broader portfolio of activities and the balance of novelty and routine among them ( e . g . , Tushman and O’Reilly 2002 ) . Thus , although much of our discussion has focused on measurement strategies for research to ascertain the degree of nov - elty inherent in a particular activity , any assessment of performance is likely to be more informative when it examines a portfolio of activities . However , just as much of our research has focused on limited contexts , it has also focused on limited mechanisms . For exam - ple , we have discussed the research on novelty exposure via alliances and as demonstrated in patent production , but these research streams are largely separate—at best , studies in one area posit the other area as a control vari - able of sorts . Clearly , organizations consistently face the choice of whether to pursue new business opportunities through means such as internal development , collabora - tive partnerships like alliances , independent joint ven - tures , or acquisition of ﬁrms with key capabilities , or by a hybrid of such options . Future research needs to embrace the fact that organizations make choices among these relational modes , which , taken together , affect their levels of novelty exposure and interact to generate per - formance outcomes . For example , Hess and Rothaermel ( 2011 ) suggested that biotechnology ﬁrms trade off exploration activity via alliances versus via the development of internal human capital in the form of star scientists . Moreover , the inno - vation management literature typically prescribes that opportunities in the core business ( that is , existing tech - nologies for existing customers ; see Roberts and Berry 1985 ) be pursued via internal development , whereas novelty necessitates outside - oriented approaches ( e . g . , Chesbrough 2003 , Powell et al . 1996 , von Hippel 1998 ) . Although work like this begins to unpack activity port - folio effects , more research comparing multiple mecha - nisms and multiple contexts simultaneously is needed . To this end , we call for deeper investigation into mechanism – context matching . Researchers should seek to develop contingency theories specifying appropriate mechanisms for varied contexts . Although it may be tempting for researchers and practitioners alike to eval - uate context and mechanism separately , simultaneous consideration might prove more effective , because the likelihood of success of varying combinations should inﬂuence portfolio choices and outcomes . If it can be determined which combinations of mechanisms and con - texts are predisposed for success , ﬁrms can leverage this knowledge to optimize their portfolio choices and outcomes . Conclusion Exposure to novelty is indeed a key concept animating theories of both antecedents and consequences of organi - zational learning . Here , we have argued that systematic empirical research needs to undertake a richer treatment of the multiple contexts and mechanisms by which orga - nizations simultaneously pursue ( or avoid ) novelty . In this way , we hope to bridge the gap between our aca - demic research , normative typologies , and practice .
