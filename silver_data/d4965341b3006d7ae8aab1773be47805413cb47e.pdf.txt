How precisely AP - 2 assembly and cargo protein recognition at sites of endocytosis are regulated has remained unclear , but recent evidence implicates phosphoinositides , in particular phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PI [ 4 , 5 ] P 2 ) , in these processes . Here we have identiﬁed and functionally characterized a conserved binding site for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 within (cid:1) 2 - adaptin , the medium chain of the clathrin adaptor T complex AP - 2 . Mutant (cid:1) 2 lacking a cluster of conserved lysine residues fails to bind PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and to compete the recruitment of native clathrin / AP - 2 to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing liposomes or to presynaptic membranes . Moreover , we show that expression of mutant (cid:1) 2 inhibits receptor - mediated endocytosis in living cells . We suggest that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding to (cid:1) 2 - adaptin regulates clathrin - mediated endocytosis and thereby may contribute to structurally linking cargo recog - nition to coat formation . Introduction Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is a vesicular transport pro - cess by which eukaryotic cells take up nutrients , internalize growth factor receptors ( Mellman , 1996 ; Marsh and McMa - hon , 1999 ) , and recycle synaptic vesicles after exocytotic ac - tivity ( Hannah et al . , 1999 ; Brodin et al . , 2000 ; Slepnev and De Camilli , 2000 ; Jarousse and Kelly , 2001 ) . Clathrin is the major structural component of coated pits ( Hirst and Rob - inson , 1998 ; Kirchhausen , 2000 ; Robinson and Bonifacino , 2001 ) that coassembles with the heterotetrameric adaptor complex AP - 2 and the monomeric coat protein AP180 / CALM into clathrin - coated pits ( Marsh and McMahon , 1999 ; Kirchhausen , 2000 ) . This process is aided by several accessory proteins including amphiphysin , eps15 , syndapin , endophilin , intersectin , and epsin ( for reviews see Brodin et al . , 2000 ; Slepnev and De Camilli , 2000 ) . The AP - 2 adaptor complex ( composed of four subunits , (cid:2) , (cid:3) 2 , (cid:1) 2 , and (cid:4) 2 ) executes two key functions in the initial stages of clathrin - coated pit nucleation : it recruits clathrin to the membrane and , via its (cid:1) 2 subunit , selects specific cargo proteins ( Rob - inson and Bonifacino , 2001 ) . A crucial question is how AP - 2 assembly and cargo recognition are regulated at en - docytotic “hot spots” at the plasmalemma . Phosphoinositide lipids , in particular phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PI [ 4 , 5 ] P 2 ) , * can directly interact with several endocytotic proteins , including (cid:2) - adaptin ( Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ) , thereby facilitating clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Jost et al . , 1998 ; Arneson et al . , 1999 ; Cremona et al . , 1999 ; Wenk et al . , 2001 ) . Here we report on the identification and char - acterization of a novel phosphoinositide binding site within (cid:1) 2 - adaptin . Results and discussion The endocytotic proteins (cid:2) - adaptin , AP180 , and epsin have been shown to interact with phosphoinositides via clusters of basic residues ( Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Ford et al . , 2001 ; Itoh et al . , 2001 ; Mao et al . , 2001 ) . Because (cid:1) 2 - adaptin har - bors a major membrane binding site within AP - 2 ( Page and Robinson , 1995 ) , we analyzed the primary sequence of (cid:1) 2 - Address correspondence to Volker Haucke , Zentrum für Biochemie and Molekulare Zellbiologie , Department of Biochemistry II , University of Göttingen , Humboldtalle 23 , D - 37073 Göttingen , Germany .

Human , mouse , rat , fly , and nematode (cid:1) 2 - adaptins all shared a common sequence motif containing several conserved lysine residues reminiscent of the phosphoinositide binding site of AP - 180 ( Ford et al . , 2001 ; Mao et al . , 2001 ) ( Fig . 1 A ) . Medium chains of AP complexes targeted to intracellular locations other than the plasma membrane , such as (cid:1) 1 - or (cid:1) 3 - adaptins , did not con - tain the putative phosphoinositide binding motif . This lysine cluster represents a surface - exposed positively charged patch within subdomain B of the crystallized cargo recog - nition domain of (cid:1) 2 ( Owen and Evans , 1998 ; Nesterov et al . , 1999 ) ( Fig . 1 B ) . To test whether (cid:1) 2 can interact with phosphoinositides , we purified recombinant wild - type (cid:1) 2 ( aa 157 – 435 ) or a mutant in which three conserved ly - sine residues ( K345 , K354 , and K356 ) had been replaced by glutamates ( Fig . 1 C ) . We then prepared unilamellar liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) and phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) supplemented with 10 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 4 ) - phosphate ( PI [ 4 ] P ) , or PC and assayed the ability of (cid:1) 2 to interact with the liposomal membrane . Wild - type (cid:1) 2 cosedimented only with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - contain - ing liposomes but not with PI ( 4 ) P or PC . The (cid:1) 2 mu - tant ( KKK – EEE ) displayed a greatly reduced affinity for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . Among different phosphoinosi - tides , the strongest interaction was seen with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , whereas both PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 were less effective in recruiting (cid:1) 2 . To our surprise , no specific interaction with PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( PI [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] P 3 ) or any other lipid tested was detectable ( Fig . 1 E ) . To see whether the mutant protein had retained the struc - tural characteristics of wild - type (cid:1) 2 , we used limited pro - teolysis . Incubation of wild - type (cid:1) 2 with increasing con - centrations of trypsin generated two protease - resistant fragments , f1 and f2 , similar to those seen with (cid:1) 2 incorpo - rated into AP - 2 complexes ( Aguilar et al . , 1997 ) . The mu - tant protein yielded identical proteolytic products upon lim - ited digestion ( Fig . 2 A ) , suggesting that it had retained native folding characteristics . An important functional prop - erty of (cid:1) 2 - adaptin is to recognize endocytosis signals of transmembrane cargo receptors ( Mellman , 1996 ; Marsh and McMahon , 1999 ; Robinson and Bonifacino , 2001 ) . We therefore analyzed the ability of the mutant protein to inter - act with tyrosine - based endocytosis signals . To this aim , we coupled peptides harboring the tyrosine - based endocytosis signal YQRL or a nonfunctional variant ( AQRL ) to beads ( Rapoport et al . , 1997 ) and assayed the ability of wild - type and mutant (cid:1) 2 to interact specifically with these motifs . Both wild - type and mutant (cid:1) 2 displayed an equal ability to recognize the functional YQRL peptide , whereas both of them failed to bind to the mutant AQRL variant ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . Thus , mutation of the triple lysine cluster does not impair the ability of (cid:1) 2 to recognize tyrosine - based endocy - tosis signals , which is in agreement with structural studies ( Owen and Evans , 1998 ) . Clathrin / AP - 2 – coated pits can assemble efficiently on li - posomal membranes ( Takei et al . , 1998 ) . We therefore in - vestigated whether purified (cid:1) 2 could compete with clathrin / AP - 2 recruitment to liposomes . We incubated liposomes Figure 1 .

The three conserved lysine residues ( red ) form a basic patch at the surface of subdomain B . ( C ) Purified wild - type or mutant (cid:1) 2 ( 2 (cid:1) g ) were incubated with liposomes containing 10 % PC , PI ( 4 ) P , or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 .

PIP 2 binding to (cid:1) 2 | Rohde et al . 211 containing 10 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with rat brain cytosol and ATP / GTP (cid:6) S , conditions under which clathrin - coated pits are abundantly formed in vitro ( Takei et al . , 1996 , 1998 ) , in the presence or absence of purified (cid:1) 2 . After reisolation , clath - rin / AP - 2 association of the liposomes was analyzed by SDS - PAGE and staining with Ponceau S ( Fig . 3 A ) and immuno - blotting ( Fig . 3 B ) . Wild - type (cid:1) 2 inhibited the recruitment of both clathrin and AP - 2 to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing lipo - somes , whereas the mutant version was an inefficient com - petitor ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . Tubulin – liposome association was not affected . Inhibition was dose dependent , requiring low micromolar concentrations of (cid:1) 2 ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . This suggests that binding of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to (cid:1) 2 - adaptin may con - tribute to clathrin / AP - 2 association with liposomes . Next we analyzed whether PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding to (cid:1) 2 might facilitate clathrin / AP - 2 recruitment to native membranes . We first investigated the effect of neomycin , a drug that se - questers PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , on adaptor recruitment to isolated pre - synaptic LP2 membranes ( Takei et al . , 1996 ) . In agreement with earlier observations , we found that neomycin inhibited clathrin / AP - 2 recruitment ( unpublished data ; West et al . , 1997 ; Jost et al . , 1998 ) . Likewise , neomycin partially inhib - ited the association of (cid:1) 2 with synaptic membranes ( Fig . 4 A ) . Recruitment of (cid:1) 2 to LP2 membranes could also be in - hibited by adding phospholipase C (cid:7) 1 , an enzyme that spe - cifically cleaves PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 4 B ) . These data suggest that phosphoinositides may aid targeting of (cid:1) 2 to synaptic mem - branes . When we compared the ability of wild - type or mu - tant (cid:1) 2 to bind to LP2 membranes , we noticed that only the wild - type , not the mutant , protein became efficiently re - cruited to the membrane ( Fig . 4 C ) . We then incubated syn - aptosomal LP2 membranes with cytosol and ATP plus GTP (cid:6) S in the presence of wild - type or mutant (cid:1) 2 . We found that only wild - type (cid:1) 2 , not its mutated counterpart , could effectively compete clathrin / AP - 2 recruitment ( Fig . 4 , D and E ) , whereas membrane binding of hsc70 was not af - fected . An intact PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding site therefore is required for the ability of (cid:1) 2 - adaptin to compete clathrin / AP - 2 re - cruitment to the plasma membrane . Finally , we were interested to see whether mutant (cid:1) 2 de - fective for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding and incorporated into AP - 2 complexes would affect AP - 2 localization and receptor - mediated endocytosis in living cells . To this aim , we tran - siently expressed epitope - tagged versions of full - length wild - type or mutant (cid:1) 2 bearing an internal hemagglutinin ( HA ) epitope . In agreement with previous studies ( Nesterov et al . , 1999 ) , we found that both (cid:1) 2 variants were incorporated into AP - 2 complexes , as judged by specific coimmunopre - cipitation of (cid:2) - adaptin with HA – (cid:1) 2 ( Fig . 5 A ) . Whereas a large fraction of the expressed wild - type HA – (cid:1) 2 was associ - ated with membranes , most of the mutant version localized to the soluble fraction ( Fig . 5 B ) . At low expression levels , both (cid:1) 2 variants displayed a punctate distribution that colo - calized with endogenous (cid:2) - adaptin . High - level expression of mutant , but not wild - type , HA – (cid:1) 2 resulted in a decreased association of (cid:2) - adaptin with coated pits ( Fig . 5 C ) . These data suggest that phosphoinositide binding to (cid:1) 2 - adaptin contributes to localizing AP - 2 to clathrin - coated pits in vivo . Cells expressing HA - tagged (cid:1) 2 were then analyzed for their ability to internalize extracellularly added Texas red – labeled transferrin or EGF . Whereas cells expressing wild - type (cid:1) 2 could endocytose transferrin normally ( Fig . 5 D ; Nesterov et al . , 1999 ) , cells expressing the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 bind - ing – defective mutant displayed a reduced ability to accumu - late transferrin within recycling endosomes ( Fig . 5 D ) . This defect was similar to that seen for a mutant of (cid:1) 2 in which W421 was changed to alanine ( unpublished data ) , a muta - tion known to impair the interaction of (cid:1) 2 with the trans - ferrin receptor ( Owen and Evans , 1998 ; Nesterov et al . , 1999 ) . Similarly , transfected cells expressing mutant HA – (cid:1) 2 were also less capable of internalizing Texas red – labeled EGF ( Fig . 5 E ) . We conclude that the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding site within (cid:1) 2 - adaptin facilitates clathrin - mediated endocytosis in living cells . In the present study , we have identified and functionally characterized a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding site within the (cid:1) 2 sub - unit of AP - 2 . Structurally , the phosphoinositide binding motif within (cid:1) 2 resembles the basic fingers found in AP180 ( Ford et al . , 2001 ; Mao et al . , 2001 ) , with several conserved lysine residues forming a surface - exposed posi - Figure 2 .

Mem - branes were reisolated , washed , and analyzed by staining with Ponceau S ( top ) or immunoblotting ( bottom ) for clathrin heavy chain ( HC ) , (cid:2) - adaptin , hsc70 , and synaptotagmin I . 1 / 4 cyt , 25 % of the cytosol used in the experiment .

In contrast to (cid:2) - adaptin , which pref - erentially recognizes PIP 3 over PIP 2 , (cid:1) 2 displays a high de - gree of specificity for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . This suggests that AP - 2 may interact with phosphoinositides via two independent sites within its (cid:2) and (cid:1) 2 subunits . One possibility is that phosphoinositide binding to both subunits synergistically triggers coated pit assembly . Alternatively , different stim - uli , such as growth factor activation , could result in the formation of distinct species of PI lipids ( Di Fiore and De Camilli , 2001 ; McPherson et al . , 2001 ) . These might then exert differential effects on AP - 2 with regard to coated pit assembly or cargo recognition . Lastly , it is conceivable that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 sequentially interact with (cid:1) 2 and (cid:2) - adaptin during progressive coated pit invagination ( Kirchhausen , 2000 ; Slepnev and De Camilli , 2000 ) or upon cargo selection and transport . Support for the latter possibility comes from the observation that 3 (cid:9) - phospho - inositides , which are synthesized by a clathrin - activated ki - nase ( Gaidarov et al . , 2001 ) , stimulate binding of tyrosine - based endocytosis signals to AP - 2 ( Rapoport et al . , 1997 ) . It is therefore conceivable that binding of 3 (cid:9) - phosphoinosi - tides to AP - 2 induces a conformational change that allows (cid:1) 2 to interact more efficiently with cargo protein sorting signals at the membrane perhaps assisted by the concomi - tant association of (cid:1) 2 with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . We favor the possibility that the temporally or spatially ordered interaction of several endocytotic proteins with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is required for clathrin - mediated endocytosis . This view is supported by the observation that the phosphoinositide binding sites within AP180 / CALM ( Ford et al . , 2001 ; Mao et al . , 2001 ) , (cid:2) - adaptin ( Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ) , and (cid:1) 2 ( this study ) apparently cannot substitute for one another . Al - though binding of phosphoinositides to (cid:2) - adaptin may largely function in targeting AP - 2 to the plasma membrane ( Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ) , the association of (cid:1) 2 with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 could in addition help to stabilize AP - 2 at sites of endocytosis or to reorient the molecule with respect to the membrane . In conclusion , the results reported here support a model according to which the binding of phosphoinositides to (cid:1) 2 - adaptin , as well as to other endocytotic proteins , links the formation of clathrin / AP - 2 – coated pits with the selection of cargo proteins .

S . Bonifacino , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) , subcloned into pcDNA3 , and verified by DNA sequencing . Hexahistidine - tagged wild - type or mutant versions of (cid:1) 2 - adaptin ( aa 157 – 435 ) were made by PCR , subcloned into pET28a ( Novagen Inc . ) , and verified by DNA sequencing . Standard techniques were used for preparation of plasmid and genomic DNA , restriction analy - sis , PCR , and cloning of DNA fragments . Generation of liposomes Unilamellar liposomes were made as previously described ( Takei et al . , 1998 ) , by using a mixture of defined lipids ( 70 % PC , 20 % PE , plus 10 % variable lipid [ wt / wt ] ) . Liposome recovery was followed by tagging with the lipophilic dye 1 , 6 - diphenyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - hexatriene ( (cid:11) EX (cid:12) 360 nm ; (cid:11) EM (cid:12) 430 nm ) on a fluorimeter after reisolation of the liposomes . Protein recruitment to membranes and liposomes For biochemical analysis of protein recruitment onto synaptic LP2 mem - branes , published procedures were used ( Takei et al . , 1996 , 1998 ) . Protein binding to liposomes ( Fig . 1 ) was done as follows : 100 (cid:1) g liposomes was incubated for 30 min at RT with 2 (cid:1) g purified (cid:1) 2 ( aa 157 – 435 ) in cytosolic buffer . Liposomes were reisolated by sedimentation , washed extensively , and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue . For the ex - periments shown in Fig . 3 , liposomes ( 0 . 4 mg / ml ) were incubated with rat brain cytosol ( 3 mg / ml ) in the presence of 2 mM ATP , 200 (cid:1) M GTP (cid:6) S , and purified (cid:1) 2 ( aa 157 – 435 ) for 10 min at 37 (cid:8) C , chilled on ice , and reisolated as described above . Transfection experiments and endocytosis assay CHO ( Fig . 5 , A – D ) or HeLa ( Fig . 5 E ) cells were transfected with plasmids encoding internally HA - tagged (cid:1) 2 - adaptin ( wild type or mutant ) with Lipo - fectamine 2000 ( GIBCO BRL ) . 48 h after transfection , cells were washed and incubated for 2 – 3 h in serum - free medium . Texas red – labeled transfer - rin ( 2 . 5 (cid:1) g / ml ) or EGF ( 2 (cid:1) g / ml ) were added and cells were allowed to in - ternalize the probe for 10 or 3 min at 37 (cid:8) C , respectively . Cells were acid washed , fixed , and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy . For biochemical fractionation studies , cells were harvested 40 h after transfection by scraping into isotonic buffered sucrose ( 10 mM Hepes , 320 mM sucrose , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM PMSF ) . Cells were homogenized using an EMBL cell cracker and centrifuged at 1 , 500 g . The supernatant was sepa - rated into membrane and soluble fractions by centrifugation for 30 min at 12 , 000 g , and samples were precipitated with 10 % trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Miscellaneous Rat brain cytosol and LP2 synaptic membrane preparations have been de - scribed previously ( Takei et al . , 1996 ; 1998 ) . Hexahistidine - tagged fusion proteins were purified from CHAPS ( 2 % ) - lysed Escherichia coli detergent extracts according to the manufacturer’s instructions .
