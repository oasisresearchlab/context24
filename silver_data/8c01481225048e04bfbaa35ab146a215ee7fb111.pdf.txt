In this case - control Mexican study we found that obesity rep - resents the strongest predictor for Covid - 19 followed by diabetes and hypertension in both sexes and chronic renal failure in females only . Active smoking was associated with decreased odds of Covid - 19 . These ﬁndings indicate that these comorbidities are not only associated with severity of disease but also predispose for getting Covid - 19 . Future research is needed to establish the mechanisms involved in each comorbidity and the apparent “protective” effect of cigarette smoking . © 2020 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity .

Introduction Early reports have identiﬁed obesity among other comorbidi - ties such as diabetes , hypertension , coronary artery disease , and heart failure , as risk factors associated with severe outcomes in hospitalized patients with Covid - 19 [ 1 – 4 ] . However , only one cross sectional study so far has determined risk factors for Covid - 19 in the general population and found obesity and chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) to be predictors with no statistically signiﬁcant association for other chronic conditions [ 5 ] . This study included patients with two or more comorbidities which may have underestimated the strength of association between obesity and CKD with Covid - 19 because the correlation of comorbidities , for example diabetes with obesity , or with hypertension , and the assumption of little or no multicollinearity in the multivariable logistic regression analysis would not be met which may explain why other chronic condi - tions were not associated with Covid - 19 in that study . In this study we determined comorbidities associated with increased risk for Covid - 19 in a population based - study of Mexicans reporting one comorbidity as of May 15 , 2020 . The present study updates a pre - ∗ Corresponding author at : Departamento de Seguridad e Higiene ISSEMyM , Av . Constituyentes # 703 , Col .

Methods This study used the publicly available Covid - 19 data base of the Mexican Ministry of Health through the “Dirección General de Epidemiología” website [ 6 ] from which information was obtained of all patients assessed for Covid - 19 as of May 15 , of 2020 . Vari - ables in the data base include non - nominal ID ( randomly assigned ) , age , gender , current smoker , history of contact with Covid - 19 , type of patient : ambulatory vs hospitalized and whether or not the patient was hospitalized in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) or had been intubated ( tracheal intubation for mechanical ventila - tion ) . Information also included answers “yes , no , unknown” or no answer when questioned about the presence / absence of the following conditions and comorbidities : pregnancy in women , dia - betes , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , asthma , obesity , chronic renal failure ( CRF ) and immunosuppression conditions without speciﬁcation of each . The presence of pneumonia was also recorded but was consid - ered part of the clinical picture of Covid - 19 rather than comorbidity . Only patients who answered “yes or no” to all the above ques - tions were included in the analysis . Patients who did not respond or with missing information were excluded . Some patients pre - sented with multiple comorbidities that may be correlated , for example diabetes and obesity , and the assumption of little or no https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . orcp . 2020 . 06 . 001 1871 - 403X / © 2020 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity .

To separate the effect of two or more comorbidities and determine the independent effect of each on Covid - 19 , the analysis was limited to patients reporting only one comorbidity . Laboratory test results of Covid - 19 PCR test were reported as “positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) ” , “negative for SARS - CoV - 2” or “pending result” . Cases were deﬁned as those with a positive test regardless of symptoms according to World Health Organization case deﬁnition [ 7 ] . Controls were those with negative test . In univariable analysis , proportions for categorical variables were compared using the (cid:2) 2 test . Median age of both groups was compared with the Mann – Whitney U test . To determine comorbidities associated with Covid - 19 , odds ratios ( OR ) and 95 % conﬁdence intervals were estimated using multivariable logistic regression with the backward elimination procedure . Indicator variables for each comorbidity were included in the model with absence of each as the reference group . Statistical analyses were performed using SAS ( Statistical Analysis System , Cary , NC , USA ) version 9 . 4 software .

Results A total 32 , 583 patients ( 12 , 304 cases and 20 , 279 controls ) were identiﬁed with one comorbidity . Cases were older than controls , median age in years ( interquar - tile range ) of 48 ( 38 – 59 ) vs 42 ( 32 – 54 ) respectively , and more likely to be : males ( 58 . 7 vs 47 % females ) and hospitalized ( 45 vs 23 % ambulatory ) or to have had pneumonia ( 34 . 3 vs 15 . 2 % ) diabetes ( 21 . 1 vs 13 . 3 % ) , hypertension ( 23 . 5 vs 21 . 3 % ) , obesity ( 38 . 4 vs 32 . 4 % ) admitted to the ICU ( 10 . 4 vs 8 . 2 % ) intubated ( 10 . 5 vs 6 . 5 % ) respectively . Cases were also more likely to have died ( 12 . 2 vs 2 . 7 % ) respectively . Univariable anal - ysis showed controls more likely to have had a history of : contact with Covid - 19 , current smoking , cardiovascular , COPD , asthma or immunosuppressed conditions , all p - values < 0 . 0001 , Table 1 . After controlling by variables associated with Covid - 19 in univariate analysis , the following comorbidities remained statistically signiﬁcant in the multivariable analysis by sex : obe - sity ( females - a OR = 5 . 55 , males - a OR = 4 . 72 ) , diabetes ( females - a OR = 3 . 91 , males - a OR = 3 . 50 ) , hypertension ( females - a OR = 3 . 25 , males - a OR = 2 . 70 ) and chronic renal failure ( females - a OR = 2 . 25 ) . Active smoking was associated with decreased odds of Covid - 19 ( females - a OR = 0 . 49 , males - a OR = 0 . 64 ) as was the group of immunosuppressed conditions in males ( aOR = 0 . 50 ) , Tables 2 and 3 .

Discussion The ﬁndings of this update and the previous analysis of data of May 7 , 2020 ( Unpublished results ) indicate that obesity is the strongest predictor for Covid - 19 among Mexicans followed by dia - betes and hypertension . CRF was a risk factor in females only . This risk increase for Covid - 19 is alarming . The higher odds ratios in females than males suggest that females with obesity , diabetes and hypertension are more susceptible for Covid - 19 . These ﬁndings indicate that common comorbidities associ - ated with severe Covid - 19 outcomes also predispose this disease . Among the potential mechanisms for the association include the higher susceptibility of the obese to respiratory viral infections including inﬂuenza A [ 8 ] and increased duration of virus shedding [ 9 ] which may also be the case for SARS - CoV - 2 . Obesity is a state of low grade chronic inﬂammation that can contribute to the onset of dyslipidemia , insulin resistance and diabetes and can modify innate and adaptive immune responses , resulting in a less respon - sive immune system to vaccinations , antivirals and antimicrobial drugs and more vulnerable to infections [ 10 ] . Further research is needed to conﬁrm whether obesity represents the strongest pre - dictor for getting Covid - 19 in other populations and settings . Potential implicated mechanisms on the association between diabetes and Covid - 19 include chronic inﬂammation , increased coagulation activity , immune response impairment , and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS - CoV - 2 [ 11 ] . Diabetics are par - ticularly more susceptible to bacterial , mycotic , parasitic and viral infections [ 12 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) 2 in the lung to enter cells [ 13 , 14 ] , this cell surface diminution of ACE2 Please cite this article in press as : Hernández - Gardu˜no E . Obesity is the comorbidity more strongly associated for Covid - 19 in Mexico . A case - control study .

Hernández - Gardu˜no / Obesity Research & Clinical Practice xxx ( 2020 ) xxx – xxx 5 may contribute to widespread inﬂammation observed with Covid - 19 . Angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors are recommended treatments for cardiovascular diseases , hypertension and chronic kidney disease and have been postulated to impact SARS - CoV - 2 host - cell interactions [ 15 ] . Unfortunately information regarding patients undergoing treatment for these conditions is unavailable in the data base and needs to be explored to establish whether med - ication types predispose Covid - 19 in Mexican patients with these comorbidities and determine the potential mechanisms involved . The increased risk of Covid - 19 among females with CRF also war - rants further investigation as does the mechanisms involved . Asthma was associated with Covid - 19 but only in the analy - sis of the whole sample . The lack of association in either sex may be related with the relative small sample size . The relationship between asthma and respiratory virus infection has been recog - nized [ 16 ] but is not well understood . A larger sample size would yield more data as to the population of asthmatics and the mecha - nism of Covid - 19 susceptibility . The decreased odds of Covid - 19 among immunosuppressed males may be inﬂuenced by relatively small sample size and needs conﬁrmation in future studies as well as identifying the speciﬁc immunosuppression illnesses associated with Covid - 19 . The lower smoking prevalence in patients with Covid - 19 compared with controls found in this study is consistent with preliminary estimates showing the same trend [ 17 ] . Active smok - ing remained statistically signiﬁcant in the multivariable analysis which is consistent with recent ﬁndings [ 5 ] . Nicotine has been pro - posed as a therapeutic option for Covid - 19 [ 18 ] . Further research is needed to conﬁrm the “protective” effect of active smoking on Covid - 19 . Pregnancy was not associated with Covid - 19 in the multivariate analysis restricted to women , Table 2 . This study has some limitations namely that patients presenting symptoms of Covid - 19 would be more investigated for comor - bidities and / or tested representing selection bias affecting the estimates . Unfortunately , body mass index ( BMI ) , symptoms , lab - oratory results and treatment of comorbidities was not available in the data base . Future studies including this information will more accurately determine the association of comorbidities with Covid - 19 . This study is one of the ﬁrst Mexican studies on Covid - 19 indi - cating that obesity is the comorbidity more strongly associated with Covid - 19 . In 2016 the prevalence of overweight and obesity combined was 72 . 5 % in Mexican adults aged 20 years or older [ 19 ] and was declared public health emergency by the government of Mexico . Diabetes , hypertension and CRF were also risk factors of disease . This work compares a previous analysis of the database extracted may 7 , 2020 ( Unpublished results ) and the results of both analyses are similar . Both indicate that comorbidities frequently found in patients with severe Covid - 19 are also risk factors for the disease . Future studies will determine the potential mechanisms behind the association between these predisposing comorbidities with Covid - 19 . Patients with comorbidities found to be associated with this disease should take extreme preventive measures and physicians should be aware of such associations when assessing patients with Covid - 19 symptoms and take appropriate precautions .
