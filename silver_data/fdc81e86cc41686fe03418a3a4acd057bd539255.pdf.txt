REVIEW SUMMARY ◥ CANCER Physical traits of cancer Hadi T . Nia , Lance L . Munn , Rakesh K . Jain * BACKGROUND : Historically , cancer has been considered a disease of the cell , caused by mutations in genes that control proliferation , differentiation , and death . In recent decades , however , the microenvironment surrounding the cancer cell has gained notoriety as a co - conspirator in tumor initiation , progression , immune evasion , and treatment response . As tumors grow , they disrupt the structure and function of the surrounding tissue via phys - ical and biochemical mechanisms . The result - ing physical abnormalities affect both cancer cells and their microenvironment and fuel tumorigenesis and treatment resistance . The links between cancer biology and physics have provided opportunities for the discovery of new drugs and treatment strategies . ADVANCES : Here , weproposefourdistinctphys - ical cancer traits that capture the biomechan - ical abnormalities in tumors : ( i ) elevated solid stress , ( ii ) elevated interstitial fluid pressure , ( iii ) increased stiffness and altered material properties , and ( iv ) altered tissue microarchi - tecture . Solid stresses are created as proliferat - ing and migrating cells push and stretch solid components of the surrounding tissue . Being distinct from fluid pressure and close to zero in most normal tissues , solid stresses are large enough to compress blood and lymphatic ves - sels in and around tumors , impairing blood flow and the delivery of oxygen , drugs , and immune cells . Acting at organ , tissue , and cel - lular levels , solid stresses activate signaling pathways that promote tumorigenesis and invasiveness and induce treatment resistance . Elevated interstitial fluid pressure is caused by leakage of plasma from abnormally per - meable tumor blood vessels and insufficient lymphatic drainage . As a result , the interstitial fluid leaks out of the tumor into the peritumor tissue , causing edema and elution of drugs and growth factors and facilitating invasion and metastasisthroughflow - inducedshearstresses . Increased stiffness is caused by matrix depo - sition and remodeling . Traditionally used as a diagnostic marker , and more recently as a prognostic factor , increased stiffness activates signaling pathways that promote prolifera - tion , invasiveness , and metastasis of cancer cells . Finally , when normal tissue architecture is disrupted by cancer growth and invasion , microarchitecture is altered . Stromal and can - cer cells and extracellular matrix adopt new organization . This changes the interactions between anindividualcell and itssurrounding matrix and cells , which affects signaling path - ways associated with invasion and metastasis . OUTLOOK : The tumor microenvironment is characterized by both biological and physical abnormalities . The growing appreciation of the role of tumor - stromal interactions in cancer has led to seminal discoveries that have re - sulted in previously unexplored targets and strategies for treatment . Understanding the key principles underlying the origins and con - sequences of the physical traits of cancer will be critical for improving treatment . Many of the concepts involved are nonintuitive and require deepandbroadunderstandingofboththephys - ical andbiological aspects ofcancer . Therefore , a rigorous but accessible description of physical cancer traits will assist research into the phys - ical sciences of cancer — a highly multidiscipli - nary area — and help it remain an active and progressive subfield of cancer research . ▪ RESEARCH Nia et al . , Science 370 , 546 ( 2020 ) 30 October 2020 1 of 1 The list of author affiliations is available in the full article online . † Corresponding author .

REVIEW ◥ CANCER Physical traits of cancer Hadi T . Nia 1 , 2 , Lance L . Munn 1 , Rakesh K . Jain 1 , 3 * The role of the physical microenvironment in tumor development , progression , metastasis , and treatment is gaining appreciation . The emerging multidisciplinary field of the physical sciences of cancer is now embraced by engineers , physicists , cell biologists , developmental biologists , tumor biologists , and oncologists attempting to understand how physical parameters and processes affect cancer progression and treatment . Discoveries in this field are starting to be translated into new therapeutic strategies for cancer . In this Review , we propose four physical traits of tumors that contribute to tumor progression and treatment resistance : ( i ) elevated solid stresses ( compression and tension ) , ( ii ) elevated interstitial fluid pressure , ( iii ) altered material properties ( for example , increased tissue stiffness , which historically has been used to detect cancer by palpation ) , and ( iv ) altered physical microarchitecture . After defining these physical traits , we discuss their causes , consequences , and how they complement the biological hallmarks of cancer . C ancer is generally considered a disease of the cell , caused by mutations in genes that control cell proliferation , death , me - tabolism , and DNA repair . To create a unified conceptual framework for under - standing the various manifestations of cancer , Hanahan and Weinberg proposed eight biol - ogical hallmarks that delineate the key fea - tures and properties of cancer cells ( 1 ) . These biological hallmarks are useful for concep - tualizing canceratthecellular level , but wenow know that the microenvironment surrounding the cancer cell acts as a coconspirator in tumor initiation and progression . As tumors grow , they disrupt the surrounding tissue biochem - ically and physically . They also recruit normal cells from the surrounding tissue , which fur - ther alter the matrix and cellular compositions of the tumor . These perturbations result in physical abnormalities associated with both cancer cells and the microenvironment in which they grow that influence tumor biology and response to treatment ( 2 ) . To provide a more comprehensive concep - tual framework for cancer , we propose four ad - ditional traits stemming from the physical abnormalities of tumors . These are ( i ) elevated solid stress , ( ii ) elevated interstitial fluid pres - sure ( IFP ) and the resulting fluid flow in the interstitium , ( iii ) increased stiffness and al - tered material properties , and ( iv ) altered mi - croarchitecture ( Fig . 1 ) . As discussed in this Review , these four physical traits are concep - tually distinct but can interact synergistically . They also enable and exacerbate many of the biological hallmarks of cancer , thus facilitating cancer cell proliferation and invasion , immune system evasion , and resistance to therapies . Solid stresses and elastic energy Solid stresses , also known as residual stresses , are the mechanical forces ( compressive , ten - sile , and shear ) contained in — and transmitted by — solid and elastic elements of the extracel - lular matrix ( ECM ) and cells ( 3 ) . Reported in pascals or millimeters of mercury ( 1 mmHg ≅ 133 . 3 Pa ) , solidstressvaluesrangefrom < 100Pa ( 0 . 7 mmHg ) in glioblastomas to 10 , 000 Pa ( 75 mmHg ) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcino - mas ( PDACs ) ( 4 ) . Multiple mechanisms , sum - marized in Fig . 2 and discussed below , are responsibleforgeneratingsolidstressintumors . 1 ) Increased tissue volume caused by cell in - filtration , cell proliferation , and matrix deposi - tion . The added volume pushes and displaces existing viscoelastic structures inside and out - side the tumor and gives rise to solid stresses in the tumor and the surrounding tissue ( 4 , 5 ) . As a result , when tumor cells are depleted through anticancer therapeutics , solid stress is decreased , and blood vessels are decompressed ( 6 , 7 ) . 2 ) Concerted displacement of normal tissue ( 8 , 9 ) . Some tumors grow as well - circumscribed , nodular masses , in which the tumor remains cohesive and pushes the surrounding tissue , generating considerable mechanical stresses . Other tumors are less cohesive and more in - filtrative , interdigitating through the normal tissue by finding the path of least resistance or by creating space by virtue of cytotoxic and protease activities . In the latter case , there is less production of solid stress ( 5 , 10 ) . 3 ) Swelling of existing glycosaminoglycan matrix components such as hyaluronic acid ( HA ) owing to ( electro ) osmotic water absorp - tion ( 11 , 12 ) . These components take up avail - able water and swell , generating solid stress that is distinct from fluid pressure ( 12 ) . 4 ) Actomyosin - mediated cell contractions . Fibroblasts , immune cells , and cancer cells can all contract matrix elements as they move around in a tumor or try to repair structural damage . Cell contraction generates tensile forces that contract ECM components ( 13 ) , creating tension in some parts of the tumor , which aregenerallybalancedbycompressionin other elements ( 4 ) . Cancer - associatedfibroblasts ( CAFs ) that are activated with transforming growthfactor – b ( TGF - b ) becomemyofibroblasts and can generate large contractile forces ( 14 ) . The impact of solid stress on cancer cell biology was first recognized in 1997 , when Helmlinger et al . found that accumulated solid stress inhibits the growth of tumor spheroids ( 3 ) . These stresses are sufficiently large to com - press and even collapse blood and lymphatic vessels ( 6 , 7 , 15 ) . Vessel compression contrib - utes to hypoxia ( 15 , 16 ) and interferes with the delivery and / or efficacy of chemo - , radio - , and immunotherapies ( 17 , 18 ) . Solid stress may also haveadditional , directeffectsontumorbiology , such as promoting the invasiveness of cancer cells ( 19 ) and stimulating tumorigenic path - ways in colon epithelia ( 20 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Cancer and normal cells have mechanosen - sitive machinery , such as cell - ECM ( 21 ) and cell - cell ( 22 ) adhesions and stretch - sensitive ion channels ( 23 ) , that allows them to respond to applied forces . Solid stresses can also act on cellsindirectlybydeformingECMcomponents . For example , matrix - bound latent TGF - b , in - active upon synthesis and unable to bind to its cognate cell surface receptors , can be activated bymyofibroblast - inducedtensileforcesonECM ( 24 ) . Other examples of ECM sensitivity to tensile forces include the unfolding of fibro - nectin in response to tensile forces ( 25 ) , the enzymatic resistance of collagen fibers ( 26 ) , and the tension - regulated interactions of fi - bronectin with collagen fibers ( 27 ) . The nucleus is also a mechanosensitive or - ganelle capable of responding to solid stresses through the activity of nuclear pore complexes and associated proteins , which modulate the nuclear import of transcription factors when the nucleus is deformed ( 28 – 30 ) . Nuclear per - turbations , such as those generated by cells migrating through small pores , cause changes in gene expression and induction of DNA re - pair programs ( 31 , 32 ) . YAP ( Yes - associated protein ) and TAZ ( tran - scriptional coactivator with PDZ - binding motif ) have been identified as potent mechanores - ponsive factors ( 33 ) that respond to physical cues , such as stretching ( 22 , 34 ) and cell crowd - ing ( 34 ) , by translocating from the cytoplasm to the nucleus . YAP / TAZ mechanobiology is regulated by filamentous actin ( F - actin ) dy - namics through Rho guanosine triphospha - tases ( GTPases ) , which probe the physical RESEARCH Nia et al . , Science 370 , eaaz0868 ( 2020 ) 30 October 2020 1 of 9 1 Steele Laboratories , Department of Radiation Oncology , Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA 02114 , USA . 2 Department of Biomedical Engineering , Boston University , Boston , MA 02215 , USA . 3 Ludwig Center at Harvard , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . * Corresponding author .

Thus , mechanosignaling by YAP and TAZ can be modulated by modifiers of actin and Rho GTPases such as cofilin , gelsolin , and F - actin – capping protein ( CAP - Z ) . In a two - dimensional ( 2D ) epithelial monolayer model of stretch , cells under tensile stresses showed activation of YAP / TAZ that led to cell proliferation ( 34 ) and induced cell cycle entry ( 22 ) . Activation of the YAP / TAZ pathway contributes to tumor malignancy in many ways , including cell pro - liferation , cell cycle regulation , overcoming anoikis and mitochondria - induced apoptosis , inducing cancer stem cell functions , and ac - celerating fibrosis and desmoplasia by activat - ing CAFs ( 36 ) . As cancer growth causes crowding of cells in the tissue , there is inevitably competition be - tween cell populations for nutrients and free space . Cell competition has recently received attention because of its relevance in devel - opment , where it controls organ size and eliminates suboptimal cells ( 37 ) , and in tumor - igenesis , where cancer cells expand into new space by damaging and killing the normal sur - rounding cells ( 38 ) . Compressive and tensile stresses , generated from the differential growth of cell layers , has been suggested to be a me - chanical driver of cell competition ( 39 ) . How cancer cells are able to outcompete the sur - rounding normal cells , which experience sim - ilar solid stresses at the tumor - host interface , remains an open question . Because solid stresses are harbored in matrix components , many of the resulting problems can be reversed by drugs that degrade matrix components and reduce fibrosis . For example , losartan , an angiotensin receptor 1 blocker , re - duces both collagen I and HA by inhibiting TGF - b ( 16 ) . In preclinical models of PDAC , lo - sartan alleviates solid stress and decompresses blood vessels , enhancing chemotherapy and increasing overall survival ( 16 ) . This strategy is currently being tested in a randomized clinical trial ( NCT01821729 ) based on promising re - sults of a phase 2 trial ( 40 ) . In another suc - cessful PDAC preclinical study , PEGPH20 ( a pegylatedrecombinanthumanhyaluronidase ) that reduced fibrosis in these tumors increased overall survival when combined with chemo - therapy ( 41 ) . Other approaches that haveshown similar potential in preclinical models include inhibiting the vitamin D receptor ( 42 ) , sonic hedgehog signaling ( 43 ) , and C - X - C motif che - mokine receptor 4 signaling ( 44 ) . Targeting the vitamin D receptor is currently being tested in patients ( NCT03472833 ) . However , both PEGPH20 and sonic hedgehog targeting have been unsuccessful in clinical trials ( 45 ) , high - lighting the need for a deeper understanding ofthesepathways . Alleviatingstressusingthese approaches may improve response to various treatments , such as immunotherapy ( 44 , 46 ) . Interstitial fluid pressure In most organs , the blood arrives via arteries andleavesviaveins , andanyexcess tissuefluid is drained by lymphatic vessels . This main - tains fluid homeostasis and results in near - zero IFP in most normal organs . This balance is disturbed by abnormalities in tumors , in - cluding hyperpermeable blood vessels and compression of blood and lymphatic vessels by solid stress . Leaky vessels , combined with a compromised drainage system , result in high IFP ( Fig . 2 ) , ranging from < 1 kPa ( 7 . 5mmHg ) in brain tumors to 5 kPa ( 37 mmHg ) in renal cell carcinomas . IFP is fairly uniform within a tu - mor and drops precipitously in the tumor margin , which generates a fluid flow toward lymphatic vessels in the surrounding normal tissue , where IFP is close to 0 mmHg . Note that IFP and solid stress are independent mechanical stresses with distinct origins and consequences ( 47 ) . High IFP in tumors was first reported in 1950 ( 48 ) and then later studied in detail throughexperimentsandcomputationalmodels ( 49 , 50 ) . Elevated fluid pressure drives intersti - tial flow in the tumor margin , exposing extravas - cular cells to shear stress . Because flow velocity and shear stresses depend stronglyonthepore size between cells and matrix components , shear stresses likely vary widely , even along individual cell membranes . The shear stresses affectthe biologyof cancer andstromalcells in several ways ( 51 ) ( Fig . 3 ) , including activation of fibroblasts ( 51 ) ; modulation of endothelial sprouting ( 52 ) , which affects angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis ( 51 ) ; induction of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activity and cell mo - tility ( 53 ) ; and activation of cancer cell mi - gration ( 54 ) and invasion ( 55 ) . Fluid flow has Nia et al . , Science 370 , eaaz0868 ( 2020 ) 30 October 2020 2 of 9 Microarchitecture Stiffness Fluid pressure Solid stress kg kg Fig . 1 . Physical traits of cancer . On the basis of the advancements of the past few decades , we suggest that the physical traits of cancer can be categorized into four major groups : ( i ) elevated solid stress , ( ii ) elevated interstitial pressure , ( iii ) increased stiffness , and ( iv ) altered architecture and geometry . Solid stresses and fluid pressure are the mechanical stresses ( force per unit area ) contained in , and transmitted by , solid and fluid phases of the tumor , respectively . Solid stresses and fluid pressure are reported in pascals or millimeters of mercury ( 1 mmHg ≅ 133 . 3 Pa ) . Stiffness ( elasticity ) is defined as the resistance of a material to deformation in response to an applied force , and elastic modulus is reported in pascals . Viscoelasticity defines the resistance of the material to deformation in response to a force applied at a given rate . Most soft tissues , including tumors , exhibit higher resistance to force ( e . g . , higher stiffness ) when the force is applied at high rates . Solid stress , the latent or stored stress in a tissue , should not be confused with elasticity ( stiffness ) or viscoelasticity ( time - dependent stiffness ) , which define how much or how fast , respectively , a tissue will deform if a force is applied . A tissue can be stiff ( rigid ) or soft ( compliant ) , and , independently , it can be under compressive and / or tensile solid stresses ( 4 ) or , like most normal tissues , it can be unstressed . The proposed physical traits characterize most cancers , and their distinct origins and consequences make them indispensable to a comprehensive picture of cancer . RESEARCH | REVIEW also been shown to induce cell cycle arrest through integrin signaling ( 56 ) . Because im - mune cells are also responsive to interstitial flow , these fluid forces are likely also involved in regulation of immunity ( 51 ) . Mechanisms for mechanotransduction of flow signals include sensors within the focal adhesions ( 54 , 57 ) , the cell glycocalyx ( 55 ) , cell - cell junctions ( 58 , 59 ) , ion channels ( 60 ) , Notch receptor ( 61 ) , and cilia ( 62 ) . The resulting signals can up - regulate TGF - b expression and activate YAP / TAZ down - stream pathways ( 51 , 63 , 64 ) . In addition to direct mechanotransduction mechanisms , fluidflowcreatedbyIFPgradients can affect tumor progression and treatment response in multiple ways . High IFP hinders the convection of drugs from the vasculature into the bulk of the tumor ( 2 , 49 ) . Moreover , the steep IFP gradient at the tumor boundary drives the flow of interstitial fluid from the tu - mor toward the surrounding tissue . This flow can promote tumor invasion and growth by fa - cilitating the transport of growth factors and cancer cells into the surrounding normal tissue and peritumor lymphatics ( 65 ) . The outward fluid flow may also facilitate angiogenesis in the tumor margin ( 52 ) and remove therapeu - tic agents from the tumor , reducing drug re - tention times ( 65 ) . IFP has also been proposed as a diagnostic marker differentiating malig - nant frombenignbreast , head , and necktumors ( 66 , 67 ) and as a prognostic marker in some clinical studies ( 68 ) . Therapeuticstrategiesforcorrectingthefluid abnormalities in tumors have also been devel - oped . One approach is to normalize the leaky and tortuous vasculature so that the intralumi - nal pressure operating within microvessels is not transmitted directly to the surrounding interstitium . Vascular normalization restores abnormal tumor vasculature to a more func - tional state closer to that of normal vessels . Using judicious doses of antiangiogenic thera - py to normalize tumor vasculature ( 17 , 65 , 69 ) , it is possible to increase pericyte coverage , Nia et al . , Science 370 , eaaz0868 ( 2020 ) 30 October 2020 3 of 9 Fig . 2 . Origins of the physical traits of cancer . Physical interactions of cancer cells with stroma give rise to physical traits of tumors through distinct and interconnected mechanisms . Leaky and compressed blood vessels and nonfunctional lymphatics lead to increased interstitial fluid pressure within the tumor and interstitial fluid flow in the tumor margin . Cellular proliferation , matrix deposition , cell con - traction , and abnormal growth patterns lead to compressive and tensile solid stresses . Matrix deposition and cross - linking cause increased stiffness in tumors . Cell contraction , matrix deposi - tion , and cross - linking also alter the architecture of the tissue . The physical traits also interact with each other ; solid stresses compress blood and lymphatic vessels and contribute to increased fluid pressure in tumors . Tensile solid stresses result in stretched and aligned matrix , and through strain - stiffening , solid stresses also increase tumor stiff - ness . Fluid flow activates fibroblasts , which then contribute to increased solid stresses and stiffness values and alter ECM architecture .

Pathways associated with the physical traits of cancer . Physical traits of cancer activate a large cascade of mechanoresponsive pathways in cancer cells and stromal cells , including endothelial , epithelial , mesenchymal , and immune cells . Pathways such as integrin and YAP / TAZ are responsive to all four physical traits , whereas many other pathways appear to be more specific . RESEARCH | REVIEW decrease vessel leakiness , increase tumor vas - cular perfusion , and decrease IFP . In the clin - ic , there are many agents with the ability to normalize vessels , including bevacizumab , an antibody that blocks vascular endothelialgrowth factor A ( VEGF - A ) and inhibitors of VEGF re - ceptor tyrosine kinases , which have been ap - proved for more than a dozen tumor types ( 70 ) . As mentioned in the previous section , accu - mulation of solid stress also disrupts the vas - cular flow in tumors by compressing the more fragile outflow vessels ( veins and lymphatics ) , which contributes to the elevated IFP . There - fore , alleviating solid stress can also decom - press blood and lymphatic vessels , resulting in better perfusion and more normal levels of IFP ( 7 ) . Stiffness ( elasticity ) Stiffness , also known as rigidity or elastic mod - ulus , is defined as the resistance of a material to deformation in response to a force applied at a veryslow rate ( quasi - statically ) . Stiffness is an intrinsic material property of the tissue — unlike solid or fluid mechanical stresses , which describeforcesexertedonamaterial — andranges from 1 kPa in brain tumors to 70 kPa in cho - langiocarcinomas ( 2 ) . Increased tissue stiffness is the most tangi - ble and best - recognized mechanical abnormal - ity in tumors . Stiffness has traditionally been used as a diagnostic marker ( 71 ) and more re - centlyasaprognosticfactor ( 72 , 73 ) . Inmultiple cancer types , including breast ( 74 ) , pancreatic ( 75 ) , liver ( 76 ) , and prostate ( 77 ) , malignant tu - mors have been shown to be considerably stiffer than benign tumors . In 2006 , stiffness sensing was implicated in determining cell lineage ( 78 ) . Today , there are numerous studies showing how thematerialproperties — in particular , the stiffnessofthemicroenvironment — arecentral to many traits of cancer ( 79 ) , including prolif - eration ( 80 , 81 ) , angiogenesis ( 82 ) , metabolism ( 83 ) , invasion ( 84 – 86 ) , and migration and me - tastasis ( 87 – 89 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Stiffening promotes tumor progression in many tumor types , including breast ( 80 , 90 ) , pancreatic ( 85 , 91 ) , colorectal ( 92 ) , andbrain ( 93 ) . Increased stiffness can also promote an inva - sive phenotype in cancer cells ( 84 – 86 ) , induce invasion and metastasis ( 87 , 88 , 94 , 95 ) , en - hance immune cell infiltration ( 90 ) , facilitate the epithelial - mesenchymal transition through TGF - b ( 96 ) , promote stem cell differentiation ( 97 ) , alter growth factor secretion and sig - naling , and increase angiogenesis and vessel permeability ( 82 ) . One of the primary causes of matrix stiff - ening is increased deposition and cross - linking of ECM ( Fig . 2 ) . In fibrotic tumors , CAFs are primarily responsible for collagen production , and these cells have more actin stress fibers , alphasmoothmuscleactin , andfocaladhesions thannonactivatedfibroblasts ( 14 , 98 ) . Collagen fiberscanbecross - linkedtodifferentdegreesby lysyl oxidase , and more cross - linking increases ECM stiffness . Transglutaminase 2 , a calcium ion – dependent enzyme abundantly expressed by pancreatic cancer cells , also contributes to covalent collagen cross - linking and , conse - quently , activation of fibroblastsinpancreatic cancer ( 99 ) . IncreasedECMstiffnessandTGF - b signaling activate fibroblasts to become CAFs , initiating a positive feedback loop that further enhances ECM stiffening . The profibrotic acti - vation of cells in response to substrate stiffness can be perpetuated by mechanical memory , with microRNA 21 serving as one of the mem - ory keepers ( 100 ) . Mechanical stresses can also alter the stiff - ness of the matrix through a phenomenon called strain - stiffening ( 101 ) . Some collagen fibers are under tension , either because of cell contraction ( 102 , 103 ) or because tumor growth causes local expansion , stretching the ECM ( 4 ) . These tensile stresses increase the stiffness of the collagen network , which in turn further activates the focal adhesion contractility of the CAFsintheir vicinity ( 104 ) , leading to avicious cycleofmatrixdepositionandstiffening . Matrix contraction by myofibroblasts is related to wound contraction , which resolves in wound healing but not in tumors ( 105 , 106 ) . In addi - tion to stretching , the compressive stresses produced by tumor growth ( 5 ) can increase the stiffness of both normal and tumor tissue , as demonstrated with normal brain and glio - ma tissue ( 107 ) . Strain - stiffening also happens at the subcellular level ; mechanical stretch ap - plied to nuclei can increase the stiffness of the nucleus through phosphorylation of emerin , one of the nuclear envelope proteins that pro - vides structural stability to the nucleus ( 108 ) . Thereisconsiderableevidencethatincreased stiffness in breast tissue is associated with higher risk of breast cancer ( 72 ) , and mammo - graphic density ( which is related to tissue stiff - ness and density ) has been proposed as a predictor of poor survival ( 73 , 109 ) . In PDAC , increased stiffness negatively correlates with the response to chemotherapy ( 91 ) . Consist - ently , in lung adenocarcinoma tumors , the stiffness of regions with dense ECM increases with tumor stage . Interestingly , however , the stiffness of the cells showed an inverse rela - tionship with tumor stage ( 110 ) , suggesting that cytoskeleton stiffness , in addition to ECM stiff - ness , can be used to stage lung tumors . Two major pathways that are sensitive to changes in stiffness are focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , which is induced through integrin liga - tion ( 111 ) , and the Hippo pathway transcription factors YAP and TAZ ( 112 , 113 ) . YAP activated by increased ECM stiffness through Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) , myosin , and Src activa - tion further promotes CAF activity , which fuels a feed - forward self - enhancing loop to maintain the CAF phenotype ( 113 ) . Matrix stiffness and tumor cell metabolism are interdependent ( 83 , 114 ) . The cell meta - bolic rate increases when cells migrate on stiff substrates or through confined spaces ( 115 ) . On the other hand , targeting abnormal tumor metabolism with metformin , an agonist of adenosine monophosphate – activated protein kinase , reduces fibrosis and stiffness ( 83 , 116 ) . Although increased tumor stiffness increases the malignancy of tumors , there may also be opportunities to take advantage of the increased stiffness by developing mechanosensitive treat - ments ( 117 ) . Other targets for reversing fibrosis include the angiotensin system , which modu - lates CAF activity through the TGF - b and CTGF signaling pathways , contributing to fibrosis ( 16 ) . ECM components can also be targeted directly , for example , by enzymatic depletion of HA and / or collagenase ( 2 ) . Matrix architecture and cell geometry Organs are constructed of collections of cells and matrix components arranged with speci - fic microarchitecture , which has evolved to optimize the stability , efficiency , and function of the tissue . For example , gut epithelium exists in a 2D sheet , with the basement membrane on one side and the lumenal space on the other . This asymmetric arrangement , or polar - ization , allows the cell to respond to fluid forces on the luminal side , monitor the base - ment membrane and the underlying tissue through focal adhesions , and sense any changes in the neighboring cells through cadherin ad - hesions and gap junctions . Other cells require different microanatomy ; for example , myocytes form aligned bundles in muscle tissue , and neurons exist as an interconnected linear net - work embedded in other tissues . These struc - tures form during development , and in adult tissue , the immediate microenvironment ( com - position and geometry ) of each cell serves as a cue for homeostasis or transformation and morphogenesis . For example , endothelial mor - phogenesis is triggered when blood flow stops and thrombosis fills the blood vessel lumen , resultinginvasculogenesisorangiogenesis . This process is , in part , induced by the lack of blood shear stresses and by the presence of the in - travascular fibrin contacting the luminal side of the endothelial cells . As tumors grow , both tumor and associated normal tissues are structurally disrupted in an ongoing , dynamic process that disturbs ho - meostasis . Cell overcrowding , protease activ - ity , and changes in matrix production can all alter cell - matrix and cell - cell associations , signaling morphogenesis . Indeed , the much - studied epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition is an example of a morphogenic switch of cells from a 2D epithelial , surface - dependent geom - etry to a mesenchymal , infiltrative phenotype , where the cell is now comfortably surrounded by ECM . Nia et al . , Science 370 , eaaz0868 ( 2020 ) 30 October 2020 5 of 9 RESEARCH | REVIEW The local tissue architecture plays a central role in cancer progression and treatment response , independent of the solid stress , fluid forces , and stiffness of the microenviron - ment ( Fig . 3 ) . A simple and familiar demon - stration of the importance of architecture is surface - dependent growth . Normal and can - cerous breast epithelial cells have drastically different morphology and growth rates when cultured in 3D matrices but are difficult to distinguish when cultured on 2D surfaces ( 118 ) . This is an example of the dynamic reciprocity between tissue architecture , function , and neo - plastic transformation , as cells not only create their environment but are also affected by it . Studies of 3D matrix architecture , mainly fo - cused on collagen , show that collagen organi - zation can bea prognostic biomarker ( 119 ) and that certain arrangements facilitate cancer cell migration , proliferation , and actomyosin con - tractility ( 120 , 121 ) . Studies designed to reca - pitulate various matrix architectures show that Rho / ROCK - mediated matrix alignment is a key step that promotes cancer cell migration in the early stages of invasion ( 122 ) . Collagen alignment also modulates MMP - dependent mechanisms ( 123 ) and integrin b 1 expression ( 124 ) , which affect cells ’ ability to migrate . Many important discoveries regarding the influence of cell microenvironment on pheno - type come from carefully designed in vitro studies . One of the earliest studies linking cell geometry to biological responses was re - ported by Folkman and Moscona in 1978 ( 125 ) ; they showed that DNA synthesis decreases as cell - substrate contact area is reduced . In another seminal study , Chen et al . were able to control growth and viability by confining cells to micropatterned islands , which con - trolledtheextentofcellspreading whilemain - taining the total cell - substrate contact area ( 126 ) . This model system has later been ex - tended to micro - and nanopillar substrate systems ( 127 ) that allow specification of cell contact area in addition to substrate stiffness by varying pillar length , width , and spacing . Mechanistic studies using these model sys - tems showed that cell proliferation is regulated by cell shape through two major mechanisms : ( i ) by regulating the cellular contractility through myosin light chain phosphorylation via ROCK ( 127 , 128 ) , and ( ii ) by phosphoryl - ation of retinoblastoma protein ( RB ) ( 129 ) . In addition to cell shape , there is recent evidence that cell volume can also affect cell response , including cell stiffness and stem cell fate , through water efflux ( 130 ) . Surface features also affect the migration of cells , through a process called topotaxis ( 131 ) . Cell geometry also influences nuclear geom - etry , which can controlgeneexpression ( 28 , 29 ) . Cells spread on a substrate have a more flat - tened nucleus than thesame cells in 3Dculture . Such shape dynamics and nuclear deforma - tions affect perinuclear actin and micro - tubule networks ( 132 ) , resulting in an altered arrangement of chromosomes , changes in gene expression , and YAP / TAZ nucleus trans - location ( 34 , 112 ) . Cell and nuclear geometries are also altered during cell migration through constrictions . Migration of cancer cells ( 133 – 135 ) , leukocytes ( 135 ) , and primary mesenchymal stem cells ( 134 ) through pores smaller than their nucleus diameter results in severe com - pression and deformation of the nucleus , lead - ing to loss of integrity of the nuclear envelope , herniation of chromatin via rupture through the nuclear membrane , and eventually DNA double - strand breaks ( 133 – 135 ) , chromosomal aberration , and genomic instabilities ( 134 ) . The architecture of the local environment can also drastically affect migration ( 136 ) . When cells are confined such that the plasma mem - brane experiences deformation , intercellular calcium ions are allowed to enter the cyto - plasm through the stretch - activated ion chan - nel Piezo1 . This causes suppression of protein kinase A activity , which regulates migration of carcinoma cells via RhoA and Rac1 ( 137 ) . In addition to affecting cell migration , pore size and microarchitecture of the ECM deter - minethediffusionandconvectionofcytokinesandtherapeuticreagents . The key relevant pa - rameters include pore size of vasculature for intravascular transport ( 138 ) ; pore size , charge , and orientation of ECM constituents ( 139 , 140 ) for interstitial transport ; and size , shape ( e . g . , spherical versus rod shape ) , and surface chem - istry ( e . g . , cationic versus anionic ) of the the - rapeutic reagents ( 141 ) . Outlook The tumor microenvironment is aberrant both biologically and physically . The growing appre - ciation of the role of the physical microenvi - ronmentincancerhasledtoseveraldiscoveriesabouttheoriginsandconsequencesofthephysicaltraits , which have resulted in new targets and treatment strategies in patients . Close collaboration between cancer biologists , clinicians , physical scientists , engineers , and data scientists will be required to ensure that research into the physical sciences of cancer — a highlymultidisciplinaryarea — remainsanactive andprogressivesubfieldofcancerresearch . Many of the concepts at play are nonintuitive and require rigorous and broad understanding of boththephysicalandbiologicalaspectsofcancer . Continued growth of this subfield will re - quire overcoming a number of challenges . As these proposed physical traits have received less research attention than their biological hall - mark counterparts , the available tools for studying them are limited . Thus , more and improved in vivo and in vitro model systems are needed to recapitulate and study tumor physical abnormalities . Better model systems willaidinthediscoveryofsolidstress – responsive pathways and delineate the biological conse - quences of solid stress from other traits , for example , increased stiffness . Similarly , addi - tional measurement tools are needed to distin - guish different causes ofsolid stress . Delineating the contribution of different factors to the accumulation of solid stress , such as cell - cell and cell - matrix interactions , is an unmet need with potential for revealing additional ther - apeutic targets for reducing solid stress in tumors and normalizing the tumor physical microenvironment . While malignant and benign tumors have been shown to differ in stiffness ( 74 – 77 ) and IFP ( 66 ) , similar comparative evaluations of other physical traits , specifically solid stress and microarchitecture , are lacking . Further - more , we know little about the origins of the differences in any of the physical traits of can - cer in benign versus malignant tumors . Un - covering the potential mechanisms , such as infiltration of stroma , mutational loads , con - tractility of cancer and stromal cells , and col - lagen shell separating tumor stroma , should help researchers better understand the causes and consequences ofphysicalcancer traitsand their bidirectional links with the biological hallmarks of cancer . Another promising area of research is the role that physical traits of cancer play in cancer cell biology at different stages of tumorigenesis , from early tumor formation to transforma - tion , local invasion of basement membrane , and then dissemination and colonization at a distant site . The contribution and responsive - ness of cancer cells to physical traits of cancer may vary at different stages of tumorigenesis and with different genetic aberrations . These factors may explain why certain transformed cells lose responsiveness to substrate stiffness ( 142 ) , while other studies have shown that sub - strate stiffness promotes proliferation of cancer cells ( 80 , 81 ) . Although it may appear that the physical traits of cancer discussed in this Review are specific to solid cancers , there is increasing evidence that they may also contribute to the progression and treatment response of hema - tological cancers . Phenomena such as swelling of lymph nodes , spleen , and even the liver subject both cancerous cells and normal im - mune cells to abnormal mechanical forces , which have yet to be studied in depth but may have important consequences on cell biology andanticancerimmunity . Overcrowdingofcells in the confined spaces of the vasculature and bone marrow results in a microenvironment with limited oxygen and nutrients and poten - tially important physical considerations that arecurrentlyunexplored . For example , in mul - tiple myeloma ( 143 ) , patients experience bone pain and spinal cord compression due to pro - liferation of cancer cells in confined spaces nearnerves . Thebonemarrowniche — theorigin Nia et al . , Science 370 , eaaz0868 ( 2020 ) 30 October 2020 6 of 9 RESEARCH | REVIEW ofmost liquid and hematopoietic cancers — represents a distinctive mechanical environment consisting of viscoelastic tissue bathed in flow - ing fluid and surrounded by bone ( 144 ) . The role of the physical properties of the bone mar - row niche has recently gained attention : ECM stiffness was shown to alter the proliferation and treatment response of myeloid leukemia in an in vitro model ( 145 ) . The physical prop - erties of the bone marrow also determine drug delivery and the progression and invasion of liquid cancers ( 146 ) . Finally , similar to car - cinoma and sarcoma cells , hematologic cancer cells are also subjected to shear stress in sys - temic circulation . Despite numerous studies on the role of physical cancer traits in the progression and initial treatment response of several tumor types , recurrence and secondary treatment resistance have not been studied in depth in association with the physical tumor microenvironment . However , there is early evidence linking the physical traits to the recurrence of cancer ; in a mouse model of breast cancer , compliant tumors had higher rates of recurrence than stiffer counterparts ( 147 ) . In a clinical study of 175 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , the stiffness of the spleen was an in - dependent predictor of tumor recurrence ( 148 ) , and in another study , recurrence rates of HCC after thermal ablation correlated with tissue stiffness ( 149 ) . These limited but promising studies highlight the need for more thorough investigations of the role of physical traits of cancer in recurrence and secondary treatment resistance . Finally , emerging data indicate that obesity increases the incidence of cancer , aids tumor progression , impairs treatment response , and facilitates tumor recurrence , but that phys - ical exercise can ameliorate many of these ad - verse consequences of obesity . How obesity and physical exercise differentially affect the phys - ical traits of cancer may reveal previously un - explored ways to slow tumor progression and improve treatment response ( 116 , 150 ) .
