Shijian Luo 1 · Ze Bian 1 · Yuqi Hu 1 Accepted : 11 May 2020 / Published online : 5 June 2020 © Springer Nature B . V . 2020 Abstract Biological examples have been used to increase innovation in design activities and design education . And biologically inspired design has been studied in mechanical engineering using biological functions and principles as source domains . However , there were few stud - ies regarding shape - based biological design in industrial design ; furthermore , the openness of the source and target domains was vague . This study tries to explore shape - based bio - logical design with closed source domain and closed target domain . In addition , this study aims to figure out students’ difficulties and defects in bionics design to promote design education . Third - year undergraduate students , graduate students , and experts whose back - grounds are industrial design were invited to be participants in the study . Participants of each expertise level were divided into two groups and were given whole and segmented pictures of white sharks individually to design electric cars . Outcome - based validation was chosen to measure the effect of analogy . Multivariate ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of expertise level and source domain completeness on the results . The findings showed that presenting designers with segmented pictures can increase the number of bio - logical elements and details in the solution . However , there appeared to be no significant difference between the novelty of the work , whether the group received complete or seg - mented images . Novice designers were more innovative and preferred to use more biologi - cal elements during ideation than the experts , while the latter tended to use fewer elements of biology and generated solutions with a higher level of abstraction . For design education , the findings will give teachers advice on how to train and inspire their students in bionics design . For the design industry , segmented biological images can increase the elements used and the details in the sketches . In addition , the evaluation metrics for shape - based BID established in this study can help designers and manufacturers in terms of production .

Luo et al . 1 3 Review Biologically inspired design ( BID ) Information from one domain is sometimes used to solve problems in another . This strat - egy is called design by analogy . Analogical thinking has been widely used to assist creative ideation and increase novelty in design activity and design education ( Chan et al . 2011 ; Fu et al . 2015 ) . Based on the distance between source and target domain , analogies can be divided into cross - domain ( surface dissimilar ) and within - domain ( surface similar ) situations ( Wilson et al . 2010 ) . Biologically inspired design ( BID ) , also called bio - inspired design , bionic design , bio - mimetic design , and biomimicry , is a cross - domain analogy whose source domain is biol - ogy and target domain is engineering ( Mak and Shu 2004 ) . When compared to human - engineered examples ( within - domain analogies ) , biological analogies can increase the novelty of design ideas without a decrease of variety ( Wilson et al . 2010 ) . Keshwani et al . ( 2017 ) found that concepts generated by biological analogies were at higher abstraction and novelty levels than those using brainstorming . BID was also as a workshop or a class in design education to see what students can create through biological example and coop - eration ( Santulli and Langella 2011 ; Helms et al . 2009 ) . Previous studies on BID focus on ( 1 ) source domains , ( 2 ) designers’ behavior in the BID process , and ( 3 ) BID supporting tools or systems . Research on source domains concentrate on their characteristics , displayed forms , and displaying timing . Mak and Shu ( 2004 ) provided designers with principles , behaviors , and forms from biological examples and found four types of similarities : literal implementa - tion , biological transfer , analogy , and anomaly under different abstraction of biological strategies . Kim et al . ( 2014 ) gave students biological examples of different qualities and displaying formats . They found that higher - value passages generated a greater variety of ideas and that having multiple passages per page improved the variety of these ideas . In real design circumstances , sources are researched and chosen from a wide range of domains . Ozkan and Dogan ( 2013 ) and Chai et al . ( 2015 ) provided designers with source domains including biology and architecture to determine their choice of source domain given their different expertise levels . The time at which the source domain is provided also counts . Tseng et al . ( 2008 ) found that source domains that are more distantly related to the design problem impacted idea generation more when there was an open goal to solve the problem , while source domains that were similar to the problem impacted idea generation more when seen before problem solving has begun . To evaluate the effect of BID , outcome - based validation methods ( Shah et al . 2003 ; Nel - son et al . 2009 ) , which include quantity , variety , novelty , and quality as typical metrics , are widely used to assess the source domain ( Wilson et al . 2010 ; Mak and Shu 2004 ) . Studies on the BID process aim to determine the steps and thinking behind the pro - cess . Helms et al . ( 2009 ) observed three BID processes used by a team that included stu - dents , biologists , and biomedical and mechanical engineers . They determined the steps in the designers’ behavior and noted common errors made given problem - driven design and solution - driven design . Chai et al . ( 2015 ) detected analogy behaviors used by experts and novices and found the differences in the frequency and duration of their performances . BID supporting tools that are focused on providing designers with biological strategies usu - ally use keyword - based search methods and knowledge - based systematic approaches ( Shu and 481 How can biological shapes inspire design activity in closed… 1 3 Cheong 2014 ; Vincent et al . 2006 ) . Asknature ( Goel et al . 2015 ) is the most popular database for bionic solutions and projects and provides users with a classified search system at three levels : groups , subgroups , and function . Some research on source domains led to improve - ments in BID supporting tools . For example , Vandevenne et al . ( 2016 ) replaced the photo of an organism on Asknature with a graphical illustration of a biological solution principle ; this was more novel than the standard Asknature solution . Besides , Vandevenne et al . ( 2015 ) . found BID was limited by the applied biological database size so they presented a scalable approach to systematic BID which can leverage large numbers of biological strategies . Templates , which help designers figure out the principles behind biological examples , are used to decrease the non - analogous use in BID process . The form of and time at which to use templates were explored deeply in Mak and Shu ( 2008 ) and Cheong and Shu ( 2013 ) . Yargin et al . ( 2018 ) and Yargin and Crilly ( 2015 ) interviewed expert BID practitioners with different backgrounds who proposed requirements for BID supporting tools not only in terms of the content of the information but also regarding the quality of the interaction . However , previous studies on BID ( 1 ) focus on the functions and principles of the analo - gies and are limited in terms of mechanical design ; thus , visual - or shape - based BID is rarely researched in industrial design . Moreover , ( 2 ) the openness of the target and source domains appear to be discussed less ; therefore , some of the comparisons are not rigorous enough . More detailed classifications of openness in BID Previous studies focused on open and closed design mainly based on the number of design - ers and the collaboration involved in the BID procedures . Tooze et al . ( 2014 ) classified open design into open innovation , open cooperation , and auxiliary methods of open design . BID can be classified into three types based on the openness of the source and target domains ( Table 1 ) . Closed source domains refer to a source domain that has one principle , form , or shape whereas open source domains mean designers can conduct searches using search engines or are provided with several design materials . Closed target domains resemble problem - driven design , in which designers have a particular design problem or product aim in mind . In contrast , designers working in open target domains do not have a specific design goal . Some research has been done on Type 3 BID , in which participants are given a biological example to use to solve a particular problem ( Wilson et al . 2010 ; Mak and Shu 2004 ) . How - ever , the source domains were not biological shapes but biological principles or functions . In BID with a closed target domain and an open source domain ( Type 2 ) , designers can browse through strategies and choose one to solve a particular problem ; however , the source domain may also be limited ( Vandevenne et al . 2016 ; Chai et al . 2015 ; Alipour et al . 2017 ) . In con - trast , BID involving an open target domain and a closed source domain is similar to solution - driven design , which is not BID ( Luo and Dong 2017 ) . Aziz ( 2016 ) believes that problem – driven BID always begins with a particular design problem and looks for biological analogies from which to obtain a solution . In contrast , Table 1 Biologically inspired design types based on the openness of source and target domains Source domain Target domain Type 1 Open Closed Type 2 Closed Open Type 3 Closed Closed 482 S . Luo et al . 1 3 solution - driven BID considers biological knowledge before solving relevant design prob - lems . Kruger and Cross ( 2006 ) divided design procedures into many activities and defined different design strategies based on the frequency of the activity . They found that a prob - lem - driven strategy always has a high percentage of data gathering and identifying steps while a solution - driven strategy has a high percentage of steps involving generating and assembling solutions . In this study , we explored Type 3 in shape - based BID . Other types of BID will be explored in future work . Shape‑based BID As mentioned in section " More detailed classifications of openness in BID " , there are many forms of BID using biological principles ; another example is the more than 200 examples in Nachtigall and Wisser ( 2014 ) . However , shape - based BID is the most widely used type of BID in many areas . In vehicle design , there are many famous examples like the “Beetle” and the “Eagle Eye . ” In architecture , the “Bird’s Nest” stadium and the “Syd - ney Opera House” are typical works . However , the design process of shape analogies in BID has hardly been researched . Visual stimuli are considered powerful in design ideation . Herring et al . ( 2009 ) found that examples helped during the creative design process , particularly in the preparation and idea generation stages . The use of visual examples is crucial for effective client - designer communication because they allow designers to understand client needs . Goldschmidt and Smolkov ( 2006 ) revealed that a workplace with rich visual stimuli , or sketches as stimuli , can increase the originality of design solutions compared to an environ - ment lacking these features . On the contrary , Laing and Masoodian ( 2016 ) demonstrated that exposure to specific types of images had minimal measurable effect on the creativity of graphic design output . In these circumstances , visual pictures were external stimuli to trig - ger designers’ thinking and they were not required to use them . However , the visual stimuli in these cases was not restricted to direct use in design . In design analogies , visual analogies refer to the use of pictures as source domains ; related studies have been done in the field of architecture . Casakin and Goldschmidt ( 1999 ) found that using visual analogies could improve the quality of design ideas and solutions regardless of a designer’s expertise level . Similarly , Ozkan and Dogan ( 2013 ) and Chai et al . ( 2015 ) used visuals with subjects asked to design bus stops and furniture . However , these studies showed subjects images related to architecture and artifacts as well as biology . In Luo and Dong ( 2017 ) , visual analogies used in cultural product design had less effect on novelty than text stimuli did on the same . Conversely , Malaga ( 2000 ) found that the use of image stimuli elicited more creative ideas than words . In this paper , we compare and discuss shape analogies , with colors and materials removed , with visual analogies . The photographs of biomimetic organisms were converted to grayscale images . Using incomplete pictures to break design fixations Design fixation occurs because of designer’s background , the stimuli provided , design environment and so on . One aim of design education is to break students’ fixation dur - ing design and many researches were engaged in this ( Sio et al . 2015 ; Atilola et al . 2016 ) . 483 How can biological shapes inspire design activity in closed… 1 3 Besides , design tools and design training are expected to solve fixations in some circum - stances ( Crilly and Cardoso 2017 ) . Incomplete pictures are considered to be related to human memory and cognition . Miller and Pressley ( 1987 ) concluded that partial pictures could help young children recall sentences given an implied instrument as a cue . Matsukawa et al . ( 2005 ) found that incom - plete pictures were identified primarily by conceptual processing , with perceptual process - ing contributing relatively little . Showing pictorial examples to designers before they begin design work can lead to fixa - tion ( Jansson and Simith 1991 ) , as they are likely to generate solutions similar to pictures provided and stop thinking divergently . Cheng et al . ( 2014 ) found that presenting designers with partial pictures could increase the novelty and details of the final product . Incomplete images are unusual ; thus , people pay more attention to them and search for missing infor - mation to fill the gap ( Loewenstein 1994 ) . However , in Cheng et al . ( 2014 ) , analogies were developed in within - domain circum - stances where mixers were chosen as both the stimuli and product . However , the effect of incomplete pictures on cross - domain analogies is still unclear . Expertise level and analogy The relationship between a designer’s level of expertise and the analogy formed have been discussed in previous studies , especially on architecture design . All these studies involved Type 1 BID with a closed target domain and an open source domain for designers to choose from . The source domains included nature as one of the choices . In these studies , students were always chosen to be subjects comparing to experts , or comparisons were between novel students and senior students . The experimental results were used to promote education methods and tools . Casakin and Goldschmidt ( 1999 ) found that visual displays improved the quality of design solutions from both experts and novices . Architects produced more appropriate design ideas and solutions than beginner students when using analogies . However , those conclusions were obtained when source domain was not restricted to biology and designers chose different source domains by themselves . Based on the distance between source and target domains , Ozkan and Dogan ( 2013 ) divided the former into bus stops ( near domains with bus stops as a target domain ) , archi - tecture , artifact , and nature ( distant domains ) . They then asked first - , second - , and fourth - year students and experts to rate the source domains , choose one as the best to use in a design and to explain their reasons . Their results showed that first year students preferred distant domains and considered novelty more important than the others did . Chai et al . ( 2015 ) gave designers with different levels of expertise images of near , medium , and distant source domains , let them talk about their source selection and reasons , then asked them to produce a design . The findings showed that experts paid more atten - tion to aesthetics and experience when selecting source domain , while third - year students were more likely to focus on symbolism and first - year students preferred function - related reasons . In terms of design behaviors , first - year students took a significantly longer time to explore the possibility of using different forms while experts paid more attention to the details and completeness of their solutions . In Alipour et al . ( 2017 ) , designers were divided into five groups according to their expertise and given five source domain categories to choose for use in designing a roadside hotel . There were significant relations between the designers’ goals for source selection 484 S . Luo et al . 1 3 and the type of source selected . These findings indicated that several kinds of similar goals could increase the similarity between sources , targets , and the novelty of ideas . However , several kinds of other goals could hinder them . In addition , expertise can enhance students’ ability to create analogical designs that have an impact on their goals . Christensen and Ball ( 2016 ) studied the role of background domain knowledge in the use of analogy and revealed that analogies that matched educational backgrounds could be generated more frequently and increase epistemic uncertainty compared to analogies from mismatched backgrounds . Hypotheses According to previous studies , biological shapes were rarely researched individually as source domains . Furthermore , many conclusions were not drawn for analogies with a closed source domain and a closed target domain . This study uses the completeness of biological images and designers’ level of expertise as its two variables . It aims to verify previous findings ( Cheng et al . 2014 ; Chai et al . 2015 ; Casakin and Goldschmidt 1999 ; Ozkan and Dogan 2013 ) for shape - based BID with a closed source domain and a closed target domain . The hypotheses studied were as follows . H1 In shape - based BID with a closed source domain and a closed target domain , present - ing designers with segmented images would increase novelty of the product . H2 In shape - based BID with a closed source domain and a closed target domain , present - ing designers with segmented images would increase details of the product . H3 In shape - based BID with a closed source domain and a closed target domain , designers with a high level of expertise will pay more attention to details and completeness of their solutions than novices will . H4 In shape - based BID with a closed source domain and a closed target domain , novice designers will generate more creative solutions than experts will . In addition , this study aims to establish outcome - based evaluation metrics for shape - based BID and to compare the performance of designers with different levels of expertise given complete source domains and segmented source domains . Experiment Participants As in Casakin and Goldschmidt ( 1999 ) and Ozkan and Dogan ( 2013 ) , the experiment was conducted with subjects with three different levels of expertise . Of these , 31 ( 16 female , 15 male ) were third - year industrial design students ( because we found that it was difficult for first - year students to design vehicles , so the third - year students were considered the novices ) , 20 ( 9 female , 11 male ) were postgraduate students majoring in industrial design who have more design experiences and more professional design 485 How can biological shapes inspire design activity in closed… 1 3 thinking than the novices , and 8 ( 4 female , 4 male ) were expert designers who have worked for more than 4 years . Designers of every level were randomly distributed into groups designated A and B . ( Table 2 ) . Experiments were conducted independently in an undergraduate classroom , graduate student laboratory , and experts’ studios . Stimuli In the past few years , electric vehicles have become increasingly popular worldwide . Nevertheless , their design seems to have been kept conventional and indistinguishable from ordinary cars . For example , traditional cars have their gasoline or diesel engines at the head , while electric cars like Tesla put their motors under the chassis so that there is no need for heat dissipation at the head . It is necessary to generate more creative solu - tions in conceptual designs . Therefore , in this study , electric vehicles were chosen as the target domain . Several common animals , including tigers , white sharks , elephants , lions , giraffes , monkeys , and pandas , were considered as alternatives . The white shark turned out to be the eventual source domain based on a discussion with four specialists as its streamlined body was considered suitable for use in car designs and its design elements are distinct . Images taken from one side and in front of a white shark were selected and processed into grayscale images in Photoshop CC 2014 ( Fig . 1 ) . To better express the different states of the white shark’s mouth , two frontal images were chosen . Because the com - pleteness of a shape is one of the variables being considered , the images of the shark’s body were divided into parts and elements from same part of different pictures were put together ( Fig . 2 ) . Procedure We first explained the aim and procedure of the study to the subjects . Their task was to design an electric vehicle based on the images given to them . To ensure comprehensive understanding , we introduced them to the fundamental structure and dynamics of elec - tric automobile systems and how they differed from traditional cars . All subjects were then given an introduction sheet and 2 sheets of white shark images . Subjects in Group A and Group B received different sheets . Table 2 Participants’ expertise level and group Expertise level Group A ( complete picture ) B ( seg - mented picture ) Novice 14 17 Medium 10 10 Expert 4 4 486 S . Luo et al . 1 3 Introduction sheet Design Aim : For the past few years , electric vehicles are more and more popular all over the world . Nevertheless , its design seems to keep conventional and not distinguishable from ordinary cars . Please design electric vehicles according to the pictures provided . Requirements : Fig . 1 Group A’s pictures Fig . 2 Group B’s pictures 487 How can biological shapes inspire design activity in closed… 1 3 ( 1 ) During designing , please write down your ideation on the sheet . ( 2 ) Generate solutions as many as possible . ( 3 ) Please choose one solution to design in details . ( 4 ) We recommend you to draw from at least 2 angles , one from the side view , the other one from the front view . Other views or detailed parts can be drawn as required . ( 5 ) Finish your works independently . Don’t search on the internet or talk to other people . After completing their designs , students were encouraged to write down explana - tions , particularly what elements of the pictures were applied to the car body , for every piece of work . Experiment steps are shown in Table . 3 They were also required to provide their names , ages , and genders . Results This study used mainly outcome - based validation to evaluate the solutions in subjects’ sketches and explanations . In previous studies of BID , where the source domain refers to biological principles ; the target domain is mechanical design ; and quantity , variety , novelty , and quality were the four main metrics chosen to measure the solution ( Shah et al . 2003 ; Nelson et al . 2009 ) . In other visual stimuli experiments , evaluation metrics including the number of ideas , originality , practicality , quality , details , and flexibility were selected ( Gold - schmidt and Smolkov 2006 ; Laing and Masoodian 2016 ; Cheng et al . 2014 ) . However , it is necessary to establish a set of new evaluation metrics for shape - based BID studies . Therefore , we asked four specialists to discuss the metrics of previous BID studies , as a result of which seven metrics were chosen to evaluate shape - based BID , including the three objective metrics of number of solutions , number of bionic elements , and novelty , and the four subjective metrics of originality , detail , abstraction , and recognition . As in Goldschmidt and Smolkov ( 2006 ) subjective scores were evalu - ated by two experts who were not involved in the experiments or the advanced discus - sions . They were given a 5 - point scale to use in the scoring ( 1 poor , 2 Fair , 3 Average , 4 Good , and 5 Excellent ) and the scores were averaged . Multivariate ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of expertise level and source domain completeness on the results . All the results were analyzed using the statistical software SPSS . Number of solutions Table 4 shows the means of number of solutions of every group . Table 5 shows that there was no significant difference ( p = 0 . 389 > 0 . 05 ) between the different expertise level of the designers or between complete and segmented images . This was also no significant difference with the cross - impact of the two variables . ( p = 0 . 764 > 0 . 05 ) This may be because electric vehicles are complicated designs , meaning that designers can only generate 2 . 54 solutions , on average , in a limited time . 488 S .

And number of bionic elements is based on the detailed solution . Table 6 shows that the designers’ expertise levels and the completeness of the images both had a marked effect on the number of bionic elements used in a solution . Subjects who were given the segmented images used more bionic elements in the shape - based BID .

Luo et al . 1 3 A post - hoc least significant difference ( LSD ) comparison for the main effect of exper - tise shown in Table 7 revealed that novice designers and those with a medium level of expertise used significantly more biological elements ( p < 0 . 05 ) than experts . ( Table 8 ) . Novelty Shah et al . ( 2003 ) counted how many instances of each solution method existed in the entire collection of ideas and created a formula . The fewer methods used in a solution , the higher its novelty was . The formula is used in mechanical design and the methods could be classified . For shape - based BID , the formula was modified and overall novelty of each subject was computed from formula ( 1 ) below : where M is the novelty score for a subject who produced m solutions and n is the number of elements used in the solutions . The formula considers both the number of solutions and the number of elements used for the novelty of the method used by one subject . The calculation of S jk depends on the which element is chosen and where it is used in the vehicle . S jk is calculated from formula 2 as follows : ( 1 ) M = ( j = m ∑ j = 1 k = n ∑ k = 1 S jk ) ∕ m Table 7 Post - hoc Least significant difference ( LSD ) comparison for the main effect of expertise Dependent Variable : element LSD Based on observed means The error term is Mean Square ( Error ) = 2 . 090 * The mean difference is significant at the 0 . 05 level ( I ) expertise ( J ) expertise Mean differ - ence ( I−J ) Std . error Sig . 95 % Confidence interval Lower bound Upper bound Novice Medium − . 54 . 415 . 197 −1 . 37 . 29 Expert 1 . 51 * . 573 * . 011 . 36 2 . 66 Medium Novice . 54 . 415 . 197 − . 29 1 . 37 Expert 2 . 05 * . 605 * . 001 . 84 3 . 26 Expert Novice − 1 . 51 * . 573 * . 011 − 2 . 66 − . 36 Medium − 2 . 05 * . 605 * . 001 − 3 . 26 − . 84 Table 8 Means of number of bionic elements Expertise level Novice Medium Expert Complete Segmented Complete Segmented Complete Segmented 3 . 64 4 . 76 3 . 90 5 . 70 2 . 25 3 . 25 491 How can biological shapes inspire design activity in closed… 1 3 where T is the total number of element parts ; C jk is the the count of current parts of ele - ment k used in the solution ; and p is the weight of this combination . In this study , all shark element - car component combinations are considered to have the same level of novelty , so that p for vehicle components is 1 . Formula ( 2 ) can be reduced as follows : All combinations of white shark element and car component are counted and given in Table 9 ; T is 462 . An expert in group B generated one solution and this solution used the following analogies : dorsal fin - head lamp , mouth - head , and lateral line - over - all car ; for this , m = 1 and n = 3 . Formula ( 1 ) can be reduced as follows : The total quantity of solutions that used the pattern dorsal fin - head lamp , mouth - head , and lateral line - overall car can be seen in Table 9 . Therefore , formula ( 2 ) can be solved as follows : As a result , the novelty score of this expert is : Based on observed means . The error term is Mean Square Error = 210 . 150 . * The mean difference is significant at the 0 . 05 level . Table 10 shows that expertise level has a marked effect ( p = 0 . 00 ) on the nov - elty of the solution . An LSD comparison in Table 11 shows that there are signifi - cant difference between novice subjects and those with a medium level of expertise ( p = 0 . 006 < 0 . 05 ) and between novices and experts ( p = 0 . 00 ) . Nevertheless , the differ - ence between experts and those with a medium level of expertise was not that remark - able ( p = 0 . 06 > 0 . 05 ) . These findings are partly consistent with H4 . Table 10 shows that there is not much of an impact from whether or not a source domain is segmented or complete . Therefore , H1 does not hold . However , Table 12 shows that designers of all expertise levels obtained a higher score , on average , when provided with segmented images compared to when they were provided with complete images .

A post - hoc LSD comparison was carried out and Table 14 shows there is marked difference ( p = 0 . 10 < 0 . 05 ) between novices and experts but no significant difference between the other two combinations .

And there’s signifi - cant difference between every two groups with different expertise level ( Table 17 ) . More design practice can significantly increase a designer’s attention to detail ( Table 18 ) . Furthermore , showing designers segmented images could improve the details and com - pleteness in the BID solutions ( p = 0 . 01 < 0 . 05 ) . These results are consistent with H2 and H3 .

( Fig . 4a ) We invited two experts to judge it in a Likert Scale . Table 19 shows that all groups working with segmented images have a higher mean score for level of abstraction in the solution . This may be because a segmented image breaks the designers’ recognition of the inherent image . Table 20 shows that there is no significant connection between the level of abstraction in the solutions and the com - pleteness of the source domain ( p = 0 . 168 > 0 . 05 ) . However , Table 20 does indicate that expertise level has a significant influence on the former ( p = 0 . 00 < 0 . 05 ) . Further - more , Table 21 also makes it obvious that designers with a higher expertise level will generate more abstract solutions in shape - based BID ( p = 0 . 00 < 0 . 05 ) . Recognition Recognition refers to how easily people can identify electric cars as being based on white sharks and it is supposed to be an important evaluation index in shape - based BID . Figure 5 gives example of solutions with high level and low level of recognition . Two experts evaluated it by a Likert Scale . Every group’s mean score of recognition is shown in Table 22 . Table 23 indicates that no findings show that the recognition of shape - based bionic designs has a sig - nificant relationship with the designer’s expertise level ( p = 0 . 298 > 0 . 05 ) and the com - pleteness of the source domain ( p = 0 . 519 > 0 . 05 ) .

Luo et al . 1 3 Discussion This study attempted to evaluate designers’ sketches related to shape - based BID and verify whether previous findings on BID can apply to the latter . In this research , designers’ exper - tise levels and the completeness of the source domain were set as the dependent variables , with seven outcome - based metrics chosen to measure the solutions produced . All findings were for a type of shape - based BID with a closed source domain and closed target domain . Hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 4 were based on former research that concentrated on novelty . Two methods were used to measure novelty : an objective one denoted “novelty , ” which measured the novelty of all the solutions from one subject based on a formula , and Table 21 Post - hoc Least significant difference ( LSD ) comparison for the main effect of expertise Dependent variable : Abstract Score LSD Based on observed means The error term is Mean Square ( Error ) = . 484 * The mean difference is significant at the 0 . 05 level ( I ) expertise ( J ) expertise Mean differ - ence ( I−J ) Std . error Sig 95 % Confidence interval Lower bound Upper bound Novice Medium − . 999 * . 1624 . 000 −1 . 325 − . 674 Expert −2 . 357 * . 2245 . 000 - 2 . 807 −1 . 907 Medium Novice . 999 * . 1624 . 000 . 674 1 . 325 Expert −1 . 358 * . 2368 . 000 −1 . 833 − . 882 Expert Novice 2 . 357 * . 2245 . 000 1 . 907 2 . 807 Medium 1 . 358 * . 2368 . 000 . 882 1 . 833 Fig . 5 a High level of recognition . b Low level of recognition Table 22 Means of the score of recognition Expertise level Novice Medium Expert Complete Segmented Complete Segmented Complete Segmented 2 . 643 2 . 912 3 . 320 3 . 100 3 . 375 2 . 750 499 How can biological shapes inspire design activity in closed… 1 3 a subjective one denoted “originality , ” in which experts evaluated the detail in a designer’s solution . Both novelty and originality results showed that there was no difference between designers who had complete images and those who had segmented ones . Therefore , H1 does not hold ; this is inconsistent with the conclusion in Cheng et al . ( 2014 ) regarding within - domain analogies . This may be interpreted as being because within - domain analo - gies are restricted such that incomplete images would provide designers with more free - dom to imagine . In a cross - domain analogy , the space that the incomplete images offered for imagination appears small compared to the stimuli provided by the difference between the source and target domains . Furthermore , results show that expertise level has significant impact on both “novelty” and “originality” . However , the circumstances of these two evaluation methodologies are not the same . Novice designers obtained statistically significant higher novelty scores than those with medium levels of expertise and experts . However , the difference between designers with a medium level of expertise and experts are not significant although the for - mer received higher novelty scores . Novice designers obtained significantly higher “origi - nality” score than experts did , but there was no significant difference between the other two combinations . The only thing can be determined is that novices are better at innovation in shape - based BID than experts are ; this partially proves H4 . These results match those in Ozkan and Dogan ( 2013 ) in which first - year students considered novelty more important than more experienced designers did . Hypothesis 2 and hypothesis 3 are about the details and completeness of a solution . Results show that providing designers with segmented images can increase the level of detail of their solutions . This may be because segmented images break the entire source domain into several parts and remind designers of information they have not noticed . Some experienced designers first analyze and extract the element before beginning their design . In this study , one expert in group A ( complete images ) first divided the shark into several parts on her own Fig . 6 . Therefore , an effective design education method to promote atten - tion to detail in student solutions would be to ask them to separate the source domain mate - rial and extract elements first . Designers with a high level of expertise will generate solutions with more details than those who are less experienced in design . This is identical to the findings in Chai et al . ( 2015 ) . Therefore , H2 and H3 are both confirmed .

Luo et al . 1 3 Presenting designers with segmented images of white sharks can also increase the ele - ments they use in solutions . In group B , most designers used one or several elements as parts of the vehicle , suggesting that separating the parts of the shark’s body gave them more choices . However , there was one novice who used one shark element directly for the entire body of the car ( Fig . 7 ) . Meanwhile , novice and medium designers used more ele - ments than experts . Experts preferred to use fewer shark elements in their sketches . In shape - based BID , source domain elements are used for two purposes : functional and decorative . For the former , the shark shape is used as part of car as shown in Fig . 8a ; for the latter , the shark shape is used purely for aesthetics , like in Fig . 8b . The level of abstraction and recognition are two evaluation indexes considered impor - tant in shape - based BID in discussions with experts . Shape - based BID in most vehicle design should be as abstract as possible in terms of recognizing the white shark . There was no significant difference between designers given the segmented images and those given the complete pictures ; however , designers with a higher expertise level pro - duced sketches with markedly higher abstraction . Experts prefer to use few elements from Fig . 6 One expert in group A ( integral pictures ) firstly divided the shark into several parts Fig . 7 One novice used tail fin to design the car’s profile 501 How can biological shapes inspire design activity in closed… 1 3 the domain and extract their lines to the design in a highly abstract manner . On the con - trary , students are inclined to use an original shark profile with little modification . Both expertise level and the completeness of source domain have no significant impact on recognition . Perhaps this is because novice designers use more elements of the white sharks and in a less abstract manner , making them easier to identify . Although experts use less elements in a highly abstract manner , they use the element more appropriately and draw figures more accurately . For example , the expert whose work is shown in Fig . 9 used just two elements of white shark , its branchial cleft and eyes , but they are remarkable and easy to identify in the design . Hsu and Wang ( 2010 ) included two shape simplification methods : full profile point reduction and component element reduction . These methods both have a strong correla - tion to human recognition , and the full profile point reduction influences recognition more . From the designers’ sketches , we can infer that recognition may be related to the number of elements used , their abstraction , proportion , and typical biological feature . An interesting next research topic could examine which variables effect recognition in shape - based BID . Table 9 shows that that the mouth of the shark is the most fluent element used in the electric car designs , with the next being the pectoral , tail , dorsal fins and the eyes . Usu - ally they are considered the remarkable characteristics of white sharks . Qi et al . ( 2014 ) used eye moving instruments to trace data on subjects’ eye movements when they gazed Fig . 8 a Pectoral fin is used to be door , b shark teeth is used to decorate the front of car Fig . 9 Solution use little shark element but easy to identify 502 S . Luo et al . 1 3 at pictures of mantises . Forelimbs turned to be the top - ranked parts on fixation duration , transition rate and number of gazing points . Then designers were asked to design an exca - vator based on mantis forelimbs . Eye traces may be an indicator to study further in terms of whether designers will use the most remarkable characteristic of a biological subject in their designs . Furthermore , the vehicle head is the most common part for which designers based their work on biological characteristics . It is always considered the most important part of the vehicle design . Previous studies found that the frequency of idea production was steadily reduced after the first 30 min and that importing various stimuli would break the fixation ( Howard et al . 2010 ) . However , providing designers with a restricted source domain at an early stage may lead to fixation because it limits the range of their brainstorming . In addition , it is necessary to ensure that the biological subject is suitable for the prod - uct being designed . Matching is another interesting topic for shape - based BID and can be studied using semantics ( Luo et al . 2012 ) and shape matching ( Yang et al . 2018 ) . As in the literature , designers with a higher expertise level were able to obtain higher - quality solutions . In our pre - experiment , first - year industrial students found it hard to design vehicles using the shark images but were able to generate many solutions when the target domain was open . Therefore , we can infer that in closed - shape BID , design - ers require experience in using biological elements to design specific and complicated products . Conclusion This study classified the openness of source domain and target domain in details . And designers’ performance in shape biologically design was firstly investigated . The circum - stance in shape BID with close source domain and close target domain was researched through an experiment in which expertise level and completeness of pictures were two variables . In addition , outcome - based evaluation methods using seven metrics were estab - lished for shape - based BID . Our results showed that in shape - based BID , presenting designers with segmented images can increase the number of elements used in analogies and details in sketches . Nov - ice designers appeared to be more innovative and preferred to use more biological elements during ideation than experts , who tended to use less biological elements and generated solutions with a high level of abstraction . In terms of design education , shape - based BID is difficult for students , particularly in terms of closed domains , because of its high requirements for expressions in sketches . Students are supposed to use less elements while designing biologically inspired products while keeping a certain level of recognition . This means they will be trained to accurately draw the form and figure out the most suitable and remarkable characteristics of the source domain . In addition , students should learn to analyze the source domain and extract char - acteristic lines by which they can increase the level of abstraction in the manner that the experts can . Moreover , it is necessary to emphasize completeness and detail in sketches that students draw . Dividing a complex given shape into smaller elements would be an effective way to increase the use of details . There is no doubt that students’ novel ideas should be encouraged and could inspire the industry via collaboration . For the design industry , shape - based BID is a pre - existing method with which to solve problems , inspire designers , and make unique products . But the question of how to use 503 How can biological shapes inspire design activity in closed… 1 3 it in a scientific process to increase efficiency and assist designers is a significant prob - lem . From this study , it is certain that providing designers segmented biological images can increase the elements used and the details in the sketches . Other biological shapes can be tried in terms of triggering and aiding design thinking . In addition , the evaluation met - rics for shape - based BID established in this study can help designers and manufacturers in terms of production . More research is also needed on source domain forms , designer behavior , and BID tools . Obviously , there is always gap between academic research and industry , which is referred to as the valley of death . The commercialization of BID should be studied deeply based on case studies and market analyses as Keshwani et al . ( 2017 ) . However , there are still limits in this study , as follows . ( 1 ) Vehicle design is compli - cated ; therefore , the number of solutions did not differ although there were many elements that could be used in electric cars . Therefore , the findings may be only suitable for com - plicated product designs and not for easier products . ( 2 ) The time for the experiment was restricted to one hour ; therefore , the ideas for designers may not have been expressed fully . ( 3 ) The number of subjects was limited , particularly the number of experts . Furthermore , if the experts had been car designers , the outcome might have been more distinguishable and they could have given valuable advice . Moreover , this study revealed interesting problems for future work . ( 1 ) In terms of out - come - based validation in sketches , recording a video of the design process might also be a good method . That way , subject behavior in terms of designing shape - based bionics can be recorded , coded , classified , and analyzed as in Chai et al . ( 2015 ) . Besides , subjects who talk aloud while making their designs and during interviews afterwards would gain deeper comprehension of design thinking in shape - based BID . ( 2 ) This study focused on shape - based BID with a closed source domain and a closed target domain , which restricts design - ers’ thinking . Other types of shape - based BID , with open source or open solution domains , are also worthy of study and comparison with design activities in closed domains . ( 3 ) Determining biological prototypes is also important in shape - based BID . From this study , we can infer that recognizing a biological product may be related to the number of biologi - cal elements used , the level of abstraction of the solution , and the details and proportion in the models . These would be interesting points to study . Acknowledgements This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( No . 51675476 ) .
