As the embryo implants , it undergoes a morphological transformation during which primitive endoderm - derived visceral endoderm ( VE ) triggers remodelling of the epiblast into a polarized cellular rosette that evolves to undertake lumeno - genesis 1 , 2 . This is followed by cavitation of the adjacent trophec - toderm - derived extra - embryonic ectoderm ( ExE ) and finally the fusion of these cavities to form the single pro - amniotic cavity 3 . The signalling interactions between these tissues are important for the embryo to break its symmetry to establish anterior and posterior identity and initiate gastulation 4 , 5 . Embryonic stem ( ES ) cells can be incorporated into the devel - oping embryo and its germ line 6 , 7 . However , when cultured alone , their ability to mimic embryogenesis is restricted 8 – 10 , and the result - ing structures neither acquire embryo architecture nor correctly recapitulate gastrulation . To address this , we previously allowed ES cells to cooperate with trophoblast stem ( TS ) 11 cells in vitro in a three - dimensional extracellular - matrix scaffold 3 . This led them to form embryo - like structures that resemble early post - implan - tation embryos with an ES - derived embryonic compartment and a TS - derived extra - embryonic compartment . These structures develop further and break symmetry to undertake the specifica - tion of nascent mesoderm and primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) at the posterior 3 . However , establishment of the anterior and the key mor - phogenetic events of gastrulation , namely the epithelial – mesenchy - mal transition ( EMT ) , were limited in this system . We hypothesized that this was because crosstalk between all three tissues would be required to properly recapitulate embryogenesis in vitro , and these structures were missing the third tissue , the primitive endoderm - derived VE . Indeed , the VE is known to play important roles during embryo - genesis . First , it develops to surround both embryonic and extra - embryonic compartments and then becomes regionalized and develops a signalling centre that will enhance development of the anterior – posterior axis by repressing Nodal and Wnt signalling on the future anterior 12 , 13 . Second , it provides a barrier for migration of embryonic cells undertaking the EMT during gastrulation to form mesoderm . Finally , migrating embryonic cells progressively dis - place VE cells to generate the definitive endoderm 14 , 15 . Here , we wished to test the hypothesis that crosstalk between all three stem cell types found in the natural embryo would enable the generation of whole embryo - like structures able to exhibit the cell rearrangements of gastrulation . To achieve this , we established cul - ture conditions allowing the stem cell lines for all three tissues that comprise mouse embryo—ES , TS and extra - embryonic - endoderm ( XEN ) 16 cells—to cooperate in vitro . We show that this coopera - tion results in the spontaneous self - assembly of structures that are remarkably similar to natural mouse embryos and contain all three embryonic and extra - embryonic compartments . We show that these Self - assembly of embryonic and two extra - embryonic stem cell types into gastrulating embryo - like structures Berna Sozen 1 , 2 , 10 , Gianluca Amadei 1 , 10 , Andy Cox 1 , Ran Wang 3 , Ellen Na 4 , Sylwia Czukiewska 1 , Lia Chappell 5 , Thierry Voet 5 , 6 , Geert Michel 7 , Naihe Jing 3 , 8 , David M . Glover 9 and Magdalena Zernicka - Goetz 1 * Embryonic stem cells can be incorporated into the developing embryo and its germ line , but , when cultured alone , their abil - ity to generate embryonic structures is restricted . They can interact with trophoblast stem cells to generate structures that break symmetry and specify mesoderm , but their development is limited as the epithelial – mesenchymal transition of gastru - lation cannot occur . Here , we describe a system that allows assembly of mouse embryonic , trophoblast and extra - embryonic endoderm stem cells into structures that acquire the embryo’s architecture with all distinct embryonic and extra - embryonic compartments . Strikingly , such embryo - like structures develop to undertake the epithelial – mesenchymal transition , leading to mesoderm and then definitive endoderm specification . Spatial transcriptomic analyses demonstrate that these morphologi - cal transformations are underpinned by gene expression patterns characteristic of gastrulating embryos . This demonstrates the remarkable ability of three stem cell types to self - assemble in vitro into gastrulating embryo - like structures undertaking spatio - temporal events of the gastrulating mammalian embryo .

Results Establishing conditions for spontaneous assembly of ES , TS and XEN cells into embryo - like structures . To address the hypoth - esis that crosstalk between the three stem cell types in vitro would permit generation of embryo - like structures with all three com - partments , as is the case in natural embryos , we seeded single - cell suspensions of ES , TS and XEN cells in medium supporting the proliferation of all these cell types into inverted - pyramidal microwell plates , allowing cells to aggregate ( see Methods ) . At the optimized cell density , the three cell types spontaneously underwent self - organization into multicellular aggregates within 24 h . After 96 h , approximately 70 % of multicellular aggregates contained all three cell types . Of these , 29 . 8 % ( n = 130 / 435 ) had single adjoining ES - derived embryonic and TS - derived extra - embryonic compartments surrounded by a layer of XEN cells , and were strikingly similar in morphology to mouse embryos at 5 – 6 days after fertilization ( Fig . 1a – c , Supplementary Fig . 1a , b and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . In agreement with their morphology , these structures expressed markers characteristic of the three tis - sues of the embryo ( Fig . 1d , e ) . Cell numbers in the ES - , TS - and XEN - derived compartments after 96 h of culture were similar to those in the embryonic and extra - embryonic compartments of embryos cultured in vitro until 5 . 5 day after fertilization ( Fig . 1f ) . We named these spontaneously organized embryo - like structures , ETX ( ES + TS + XEN ) embryos . Mesoderm and primordial germ - cell - like cell specification . We first examined the development of ETX embryos to assess to what extent it was similar and different from the development of natural embryos and of the previous synthetic embryos ( ET embryos ) we had generated from only ES and TS cells 3 . Several developmental events followed similar spatio - temporal patterns . This included asymmetric expression of the mesoderm marker , T / Brachyury , in the ES compartment close to the TS compartment boundary 4 . 25 days after plating and extending towards the distal tip by day 5 . 5 , thus resembling T / Brachyury expression in early ( E6 . 5 ) to mid - streak ( E7 . 0 ) stage embryos ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ; 42 % ETX embryos , n = 101 ; 90 % E6 . 5 embryos , n = 20 ) . The ratio of T / Brachyury - expressing to total cells in the ES compartment of these ETX embryos was significantly higher than in synthetic embryos generated from only ES and TS cells and similar to embryos at equivalent developmental stage ( Supplementary Fig . 2c , d ) . In con - trast , the majority of structures formed from ES and XEN cells alone did not express T / Brachyury in these conditions , indicating that this is promoted by signalling from the TS - derived compartment ( Supplementary Fig . 2e – g ) . In natural embryogenesis , primordial germ - cell - like cells ( PGCs ) are specified at the posterior . To address whether this is also the case for ETX embryos , we next built them using ES cells expressing a T : GFP reporter . We found that expression of PGC markers ( assessed on protein and mRNA levels ) was induced at day 6 at the boundary between the ES - and TS - derived compartments and proximal to the mesodermal domain ( Supplementary Fig . 2h – i ) . We also found an inverse gradient of Oct4 and T / Brachyury protein across the ES - derived - embryonic compartment at this stage ( Supplementary Fig . 2j ) , indicating that not only the posterior , but also aspects of the anterior pattern became established as development of ETX embryos progressed , reminiscent of natural embryogenesis . These results indicate that ETX embryos develop to break symmetry close to the ES / TS compartment boundary to induce expression of meso - derm and PGC markers . XEN cell layer , basal membrane and cavity development . Lumenogenesis of embryos requires signalling from the basement membrane generated by the VE 1 . We therefore asked whether this requirement could be met by the XEN layer in ETX embryos . We found that the XEN layer formed a laminin - containing basement membrane where the XEN cells met the ES - and TS - derived com - partments ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . The localization of E - cadherin and podocalaxin indicated that this basal membrane was functional , because it induced polarization and lumenogenesis in ES - and TS - derived compartments ( Supplementary Fig . 3b – d ) , and base - ment membrane was not detectable between these compartments at day 5 ( Supplementary Fig . 3e , f ) . Thus , by providing components of the basal membrane to enable ES and TS cell maturation , the XEN layer appears to fulfil one role of the VE . Regionalization of the XEN cell layer . During embryogenesis , VE undergoes functional regionalization . The VE overlying the embry - onic compartment develops as a heterogeneous mix of squamous and cuboidal cells at E5 . 25 , which resolves at E6 . 75 into defined squamous VE . In contrast , the VE overlying the ExE develops pre - dominantly cuboidal morphology . We found that as ETX embryos developed , XEN cells overlying the ES - derived compartment became squamous by day 5 , whereas those overlying the TS - derived compartment remained cuboidal ( Fig . 2a ) , thus resembling VE compartmentalization in natural embryos ( Fig . 2b ) . The propor - tions of cells between the embryonic and extra - embryonic XEN lay - ers in ETX embryos were similar to the distribution in the VE of natural embryos ( Fig . 2c ) . Thus , cellular morphogenesis of the ETX embryo XEN layer resembles natural VE . Further regionalization of VE leads to the formation of anterior visceral endoderm ( AVE ) , which secretes Lefty1 , DKK1 and Cerl to antagonize posteriorizing morphogens and establish an ante - rior – posterior gradient of Nodal within the epiblast 17 . To assess Nodal patterning as the ETX embryos developed , we built them using ES cells expressing the Nodal ‘highly bound element’ HBE - YFP reporter 18 . At 4 days , the ETX embryos showed uniform Nodal expression throughout the ES - derived compartment ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 4a – c ; 90 % , n = 18 / 20 ) , becoming asymmetric and higher on the presumptive posterior side at day 5 ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 4a – c ; 80 % , n = 16 / 20 ) . To assess whether this could be a response to antagonism by a developing AVE - like domain , we assessed the expression of Lefty1 17 at days 4 and 5 . We found that some ETX embryos showed asym - metric Lefty1 expression in the XEN layer ( Fig . 3c , n = 7 / 17 ) , indic - ative of AVE - like specification . On days 4 to 5 , increased Lefty1 immunofluorescence became evident on the side of the XEN layer opposite T / Brachyury or Nodal HBE - YFP expression ( Fig . 3c – e ) . Similar regionalization of gene expression was further assessed by in situ hybridization to localize Cerl , Nodal , T / Brachyury , Cripto , Wnt3 and Bmp4 in day 4 and 5 ETX embryos in comparison to natural embryos ( Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . We next examined the localization of Otx2 , which also regulates AVE and the anterior – posterior axis specification 19 . We found Otx2 was expressed only in XEN cells overlying the embryonic , and not the extra - embryonic compartment ( Fig . 3f , 42 % n = 20 ) and became progressively restricted to one side of ETX embryos from day 4 to 5 , resembling Otx2 expression in E5 . 75 – E6 . 75 embryos ( Fig . 3f ) . Together , these results indicate that the XEN layer in the ETX embryo undergoes regionalization and , at least in some structures , can develop to express AVE markers on the side opposite posterior T / Brachyury and Nodal expression , thus mimicking AVE specifica - tion and localization . Cell migratory events characteristic of the EMT at gastrula - tion . During embryogenesis , epiblast cells expressing T / Brachyury undertake the EMT and ingress into the space between the epiblast NATuRE CELL BioLoGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Technical RepoRT NaTurE CEll Biology b ESC alone TSC alone XEN alone ESC + TSC ESC + XEN TSC + XEN ESC + TSC + XEN c ETX embryo Twin structures Frequency of structures Frequency of ETX embryo 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % D AP I O c t 4 G a t a6 69 . 2 % 7 . 5 % 8 . 4 % 8 . 6 % 1 . 1 % 2 . 9 % 1 . 8 % 70 . 2 % 29 . 8 % a DAPI Gata6 Oct4 Tfap2c DAPI Gata4 Eomes Oct4 ETX medium Day 0 Day 2 Day 3 Day 1 IVC1 IVC2 Day 4 Day 5 Day 6 E T X e m b r y o ( D 4 ) E T X e m b r y o ( D 5 ) I n v i t r o c u l t u r ed e m b r y o E 6 . 0 e m b r y o G a t a4 O c t 4 T f ap2 c XEN cells ESCs TSCs TSC ESC XEN TSC ESC XEN VE ExE Epi ETX embryo In vitro cultured embryo e f N u m be r o f O c t 4 + c e ll s TSC / ExE compartment XEN / VE compartment N u m b e r o f T f ap2 c + c e ll s N u m be r o f G a t a6 + c e ll s ESC / EPI compartment P = 0 . 0938 P = 0 . 2547 P = 0 . 4001 ExE VE Epi M a x . p r o j e c t i on ETX embryo 1 ETX embryo 2 ETX embryo 3 ETX embryo 4 ETX embryo 5 ETX embryo 6 ETX embryo 7 T f ap2 c O c t 4 G a t a6 TSC ESC XEN TSC TSC ESC XEN d TSC ESC ESC XEN 150 100 50 0 150 100 50 0 400 300 100 200 0 ETX embryo Twin structures M i dd l e p l ane Fig . 1 | Self - assembly of embryo - like structures , ETX embryos . a , Schematic of an AggreWell with ES , TS and XEN cells on day 0 , and representative examples of ETX embryos stained for lineage markers after progressive times in culture .

When we analysed ETX embryos developing to day 5 we could identify bottle - shaped T / Brachyury - expressing cells with nuclei oriented parallel rather than perpen - dicular to the basal membrane within the ES - derived embryonic compartment and between the ES and XEN layers ( Fig . 4a , b and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . To examine if these cells indeed had char - acteristics of migratory mesenchyme , we microsurgically isolated T : GFP - negative and T : GFP - positive cells and carried out RT – qPCR . This revealed upregulation of EMT markers Snai1 , Vimentin , Mmp9 and N - cadherin in T : GFP - positive cells ( Fig . 4c ) , a transcriptional program reflecting the EMT . To further confirm that such cells behaved as migrating mesenchyme , we next built ETX embryos using CAG : GFP ES cells and filmed their development . At the onset of T / Brachyury induction at day 4 . 5 , CAG : GFP expressing ES cells on one side maintained intact , organized epithelium , whereas on the oppo - site side , they changed their orientation at the ES / TS boundary ( arrowheads , Fig . 4d , Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . We could iden - tify cells undergoing apical constriction within the ES cell layer and transitioning through a bottle - to a rounded - mesenchymal shape ( asterisks , Fig . 4e ; Supplementary Movie 2 ) , supporting observations on fixed synthetic embryos and mirroring natural development 20 . We confirmed cell polarity changes in the pos - terior ES - derived embryonic compartment through loss of the apical positioning of the Golgi marker GM130 , as cells adopted their bottle - shaped , migratory morphology ( asterisk , Fig . 4f , g ) . Finally , newly formed mesenchymal cells also changed polar - ity from an apico - basal to a front – rear orientation , in a man - ner not due to the rounding of mitotic cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5c , d ) . Reoriented cells in this newly formed mesoderm layer expressed N - cadherin but did not form a continuous epithe - lium ( Supplementary Fig . 5e ) . These observations suggest that T / Brachyury - expressing cells in ETX embryos can undertake migratory events typical of the EMT .

NATuRE CELL BioLoGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Technical RepoRT NaTurE CEll Biology To achieve ingression during the EMT , cells have to breach the basement membrane 20 , 21 . To determine if this occurs in ETX embryos , we analysed the major component of basement mem - brane , laminin . We found laminin was disrupted in the region of T / Brachyury expression ( Fig . 4h and Supplementary Fig . 5f , g ) . To determine whether this disruption depended on Wnt signalling , as is the case during natural embryogenesis , we subjected ETX embryos to the Wnt antagonist , DKK1 . This prevented T / Brachyury expression and basement membrane disruption ( Fig . 4i , Supplementary Fig . 5h , 70 % versus 25 % , P < 0 . 05 Fisher’s exact test , n = 20 ETX embryos per group ) .

NATuRE CELL BioLoGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Technical RepoRT NaTurE CEll Biology mesoderm in gastrulating embryo - like structures could develop to express axial mesodermal markers . We found that Foxa2 , a tran - scription factor also expressed later in definitive endoderm 22 , 23 , was expressed in XEN cells and a cluster of intermediate posterior ES cells at day 5 , resembling early axial mesoderm induction 6 . 5 days after fertilization ( Fig . 5a , middle ) . Cells expressing both Foxa2 and T / Brachyury were at the most distal part of the posterior domain at day 6 ( Fig . 5a – d and Supplementary Fig . 6a , b ) . This expression pat - tern is typical of cells fated to become axial mesoderm , confined to the anterior - most primitive streak in E7 . 0 embryos 24 ( Fig . 5a – d and Supplementary Fig . 6a , b ) and which will then express genes iden - tifying the notochord and node 25 . Thus , progression of mesoderm development in gastrulating embryo - like structures appears similar to natural embryos . In natural embryos , definitive endoderm cells emerging from the anterior primitive streak become incorporated into the VE , which is progressively displaced anteriorly and proximally 15 . We found that similar events can be achieved in gastrulating ETX embryos , as we observed a subset of Foxa2 - and Sox17 - expressing cells between the ES and XEN compartments and contacting the XEN layer at day 5 ( Fig . 6a ) . To substantiate these observations , we built ETX embryos with EGFP - reporter XEN cells . Strikingly , as develop - ment progressed , GFP - negative areas appeared in the continuous layer of GFP - positive XEN cells at day 6 , as egressing cells from the ES - derived compartment were accommodated there ( Fig . 6b , sec - ond row ) . Accordingly , cells in these GFP - negative areas expressed the definitive endoderm marker Foxa2 ( Fig . 6b , second and third row ) . By the end of day 6 , there were few remaining GFP - positive cells , suggesting ES - derived definitive endoderm cells had largely replaced the XEN - derived VE - like layer ( Fig . 6b , fourth row ) . To confirm this further , we built ETX embryos using XEN : GFP cells and membrane - marked CAG : GFP or mTmG ES cells ( Fig . 6c , d ) . Again , we found egressing Sox17 - positive mTmG cells that con - tacted the XEN layer at day 5 and intercalated into the XEN layer at day 6 ( Fig . 6d ) . These results demonstrate that gastrulating ETX embryos develop not only mesoderm but also definitive endoderm . Gastrulating embryo - like structures resemble E7 . 0 mid - gastrula embryos in gene expression . Finally , we sought to compare gene expression patterns between gastrulating ETX embryos and natural embryos . We therefore built ETX embryos from T : GFP - expressing ES cells and dissected at day 5 their individual non - fluorescent pro - spective anterior parts ( side 1 ) and fluorescent prospective posterior parts ( side 2 ) to isolate mRNA for deep RNA – seq ( see Methods ) . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) indicated close clustering of side 2 and more loose clustering , or higher variability , in side 1 ( Fig . 7a and Supplementary Fig . 7a – c ) , indicating distinct pattern - ing between the two sides . We identified 499 genes upregulated on side 2 compared to side 1 and 239 upregulated on side 1 compared to side 2 , with good agree - ment between biological replicates ( Fig . 7b , c and Supplementary Fig . 7a – c ) . Gene ontology ( GO ) analysis of genes upregulated on side 1 identified terms associated with anterior embryonic devel - opment , including neural precursor and nervous system develop - ment , whereas side 2 analysis identified terms relevant to posterior development including gastrulation , node formation , cilium assem - bly and left – right symmetry ( Fig . 7c and Supplementary Fig . 7c – e ) . Moreover , genes differentially expressed on side 2 included pos - terior fate determinants such as Nodal , Wnt , Eomes , Mixl1 and Nanog ( Fig . 7b , c ) . Thus side 1 of gastrulating ETX embryos had an anterior , and side 2 , a posterior gene expression signature . To further assess developmental relationships of gastrulating ETX embryos and the anterior / posterior parts of natural embryos , we performed a neighbour - joining ( NJ ) tree analysis 26 to generate a gene signature for different sample domains using differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) to compute topological distances and a distance matrix . These signatures allowed us to group ETX embryos and the epiblast of natural embryos at E6 . 5 , E7 . 0 and E7 . 5 into a phylogenetic tree whose branching indicates samples most similar in gene expression ( Fig . 7d ) . All side 2 samples of ETX embryos clustered closely with the posterior part of the E7 . 0 embryo , and side 1 samples with the anterior part of the E7 . 5 embryo , supporting the idea that axis patterning of gastrulating ETX embryos occurs as in natural embryos ( Fig . 7d ) . Having identified such an anterior signature for side 1 and poste - rior signature for side 2 , we next wished to compare the side 1 and 2 transcriptomes to spatial domains of gene expression in the epiblast of embryos . To this end , we calculated the correlation between gene expression levels from side 1 or side 2 samples from three gastrulat - ing ETX embryos ( A , B , C ; Fig . 7e ) and particular epiblast regions at E6 . 5 , E7 . 0 and E7 . 5 , visualizing the outcome on ‘corn plots’ 27 . Side 2 samples of gastrulating ETX embryos showed few regionalized dif - ferences with E6 . 5 embryos , but strongly resembled the posterior of gastrulating embryos at E7 . 0 ( Fig . 7e ) . This correlation of posterior gene expression between side 2 of ETX embryos and E7 . 5 embryos was not evident . Side 1 samples of ETX embryos showed very weak correlation in gene expression pattern with the anterior epiblast of E6 . 5 embryos and an increasingly striking correlation with the ante - rior subdomains of the epiblast at E7 . 0 and E7 . 5 ( Fig . 7e ) . Thus , the transcriptomes of sides 1 and 2 of ETX embryos correlate with the respective anterior and posterior epiblast of gastrulating embryos , supporting the conclusion that ETX embryos develop to specify regionalized domains characteristic of natural gastrulation . Discussion Here , we describe the ability of the stem cell types derived from the three component tissues of the mouse embryo to collaborate to form structures that morphologically and transcriptionally resemble embryos developing to exhibit key landmarks of gastru - lation , including mesoderm and definitive endoderm formation . In this model system , we have made no attempt to direct stem cells to cooperate , but have allowed them to self - sort and self - organize . Thus , it is remarkable that many ( although not all ) of the resulting multicellular aggregates develop to resemble gastrulating natural embryos in both morphology and gene expression . We conclude that the ability for such a large proportion of ETX embryos to form spontaneously reflects the robust self - organizing properties of mammalian development . Some features of the gastrulating ETX embryo model we describe here were also seen in our previous ET embryo model comprising only ES and TS cells 3 . As with ET embryos , ETX embryos form distinct , ES - derived and TS - derived compartments that under - take lumenogenesis and then form a common cavity resembling the pro - amniotic cavity of natural pre - gastrulating embryos . They then take the next step and specify mesoderm , as shown by T / Brachyury expression in the embryonic - like compartment abut - ting the extra - embryonic boundary ( Fig . 7f ) . Moreover , both syn - thetic ET and ETX embryos initiate PGC - like cell formation in the proximal - most part of this T / Brachyury domain . However , whereas development of ET embryos requires exogenous extracellular matrix , as we have previously shown 3 , the XEN - derived VE - like layer in the ETX embryos overcomes this requirement , permit - ting them to develop further ( Fig . 7f ) . As synthetic embryogenesis progresses , this enveloping VE - like layer becomes regionalized , as in natural development . Also , within the squamous cells cover - ing the embryonic - like compartment of some ETX embryos , we could observe an emerging group of cells expressing anterior sig - nalling centre markers . The VE - like layer also permits the orderly morphogenetic events of gastrulation evident from the onset of EMT - associated gene expression as well as the shape changes and migration of T / Brachyury - expressing cells to create a cell layer between the ES - derived embryonic compartment and VE - like cells . NATuRE CELL BioLoGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Technical RepoRT NaTurE CEll Biology These T / Brachyury - expressing cells develop to express axial meso - derm markers and to migrate outwards to intercalate into the VE - like layer to form cells resembling definitive endoderm . Our results also show that at this stage , cells from the anterior and pos - terior parts of the gastrulating ETX embryos exhibit gene expres - sion characteristic of natural gastrulating embryos at E7 . 0 / E7 . 5 of development . The gastrulation of ETX embryos is not perfect . We do not , for example , observe the formation of mesodermal wings as dur - ing natural gastrulation . Cell ingression into the mesodermal layer is also not uniform along the T / Brachyury - positive domain . Thus , although the ETX embryos are gastrulating , the final structures are incomplete . However , it is important to note that even natural embryos do not gastrulate in vitro as perfectly as embryos devel - oping in vivo . Nevertheless , despite this current limitation , our results show that the principal morphogenetic events of the early / mid stages of gastrulation in vivo can occur in the correct spatio - temporal sequence in ETX embryos established from three stem cell types in vitro . In conclusion , the results we present here demonstrate the remarkable self - organizing ability of the three distinct stem cell types for the three founding tissues to build embryo - like structures that recapitulate not only embryo morphogenesis and gene expres - sion but also , uniquely , the gastrulation cell movements leading to axial mesoderm and definitive endoderm specification .

Embryos were transferred to PBT drops in oil - filled optical plates before confocal imaging . For the antibodies used see Supplementary Table 1 . Criteria for ETX embryo inclusion and comparison to natural embryos . Following completion of any given aggregation experiment , ETX embryos were fixed ( see ‘Immunofluorescence staining’ ) and those clearly displaying an outer layer of cells and two inner , well - defined compartments were manually selected for further analysis . Identity of the compartments was verified by immunofluorescence using Oct4 to mark the ES cell - derived embryonic compartment , Tfap2c or Eomes for the TS cell - derived , and Gata4 , Gata6 or Sox17 for the XEN cell - derived extra - embryonic compartments . This was not necessary in instances where cell lines with appropriate fluorescent reporters were used . ETX embryos were staged relative to natural embryos based on their common morphological features and developmental milestones . In a typical experiment , lumenogenesis was initiated at day 3 with only a single cavity present in the ES - derived embryonic compartment . This stage is comparable to E5 . 0 / E5 . 25 . By day 4 , one or more small additional cavities developed within the TS - derived extra - embryonic compartment ; this stage is comparable to an E5 . 5 stage natural embryo . By day 5 , the cavities in the ES and TS compartments combined into a single large cavity , T / Brachyury was expressed and cell migratory events took place ; this stage is comparable to an E6 . 0 / E6 . 75 natural embryo . Finally , definitive endoderm and axial mesoderm formation in ETX embryos could be observed from day 6 onwards ; this stage was comparable to a natural E6 . 75 / E7 . 5 embryo . Cryosectioning and immunostaining . ETX embryos and natural embryos were fixed for 20 min in 4 % PFA at room temperature and washed twice in PBS . Samples were infiltrated in ice - cold 20 % sucrose ( in PBS ) until each sample dropped to the bottom of a plate , embedded in 20 % sucrose / 7 . 5 % gelatin ( in PBS ) , and frozen in liquid nitrogen . Blocks were serially sectioned in the transverse plane at 15 µ m thickness . Sections on slides were stored at – 20 °C overnight . For immunostaining , sections were rehydrated for 10 min in PBS , permeabilized for 15 min in 0 . 1 M Glycin / 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 , washed twice in PBS , blocked for at least 1 h , and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C . Sections were then washed twice in 0 . 5 % Tween / PBS , incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature , washed twice in 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 / PBS and mounted for confocal microscopy with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI . For antibodies used see Supplementary Table 1 . Image data acquisition , processing and quantification . Images were acquired with an inverted Leica SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica Microsystems ) , using a Leica Fluotar VISIR 0 . 95 NA × 25 objective . Fluorophores were excited with a 405 nm diode laser ( DAPI ) , a 488 nm argon laser ( GFP ) , a 543 nm HeNe laser ( Alexa Fluor 543 / 555 ) and a 633 nm HeNe laser ( Alexa Fluor 633 / 647 ) . Images were acquired with 0 . 5 – 1 . 2 μ m z separation . Raw data were processed using open - source image analysis software Fiji or Imaris ( Bitplane ) and assembled in Photoshop CC 2017 ( Adobe ) . Digital quantifications and immunofluorescence signal intensity graphs were obtained using Fiji software , and quantification of the cell number was performed in Imaris software . Immunofluorescence intensity measurements of gene expression . For Nodal - YFP asymmetry , analysis was performed using Fiji software . A line from the proximal – distal axis , defining the midline of ETX embryos , was drawn to determine the left and right sides of the structure . Second , the shape of each nucleus in the embryonic compartment ( Oct4 positive ) was traced and added as a region of interest ( ROI ) to the ROI manager tool . The corresponding Nodal - YFP channel was then selected and all the previously defined ROIs were used to measure a mean intensity value in the Nodal - YFP channel for each cell nucleus . This procedure was repeated five times for other z planes . All the values for the left side were then plotted against all the values for the right side and tested with Student’s t - test . ETX embryos were considered to express Nodal - YFP asymmetrically where statistically significant differences were shown between left and right . For Lefty1 asymmetry , analysis was performed using Fiji software . A line from the proximal – distal axis , defining the midline of ETX embryos , was drawn to determine the left and right sides of the structure . For each selected z plane , a line was drawn from left to right of the ETX embryos , following the curvature of the XEN layer ( XEN / VE markers ) . The grey values ( intensities ) for Lefty1 were calculated using the ‘plot - profile’ function . This measurement was performed on the right and left side of at least six z planes ( see figure legends ) . If the average Lefty1 intensity was statistically significantly different between left and right sides ( Student’s t - test ) , Lefty1 was considered asymmetric . Reconstruction of the embryonic compartment of ETX embryos and natural embryos . Reconstruction was performed using Imaris software ( Bitplane ) . Every single cell expressing Oct4 in the embryonic compartment and every T / Brachyury - expressing cell was plotted on a projection of all cells in the structure . Cells Methods Embryo recovery and culture . Mice were kept in the animal house in accordance with national and international guidelines . All experiments were regulated by the Animals ( Scientific Procedures ) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations 2012 following ethical review by the University of Cambridge Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body ( AWERB ) . Experiments were approved by the Home Office . Animals were inspected daily and those that showed health concerns were culled by cervical dislocation . Six - week - old female CD - 1 mice were naturally mated and killed after 5 , 6 or 7 days post coitum . The uterus was recovered and embryos dissected from deciduae in M2 medium . Blastocysts were recovered at E4 . 5 by uterine flushing , their mural trophectoderm dissected away , then cultured in IVC1 and IVC2 media ( Cell Guidance Systems ) , as previously decribed 28 . Cell culture . ES and TS cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 on mitotically inactivated CF1 or NMRI mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) and passaged once they reached 80 % confluency . Cells were cultured in ETX medium consisting of Dulbecco’s modified essential medium ( DMEM , Gibco cat . no . 21969 ) with 12 . 5 % FBS , 2 mM GlutaMax ( Gibco cat . no . 35050 - 038 ) , 0 . 1 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ( 2 - ME , Gibco cat . no . 31350 - 010 ) , 0 . 1 mM nonessential amino acids ( Gibco cat . no . 11140 - 035 ) , 1 mM sodium pyruvate ( Gibco cat . no . 11360 - 039 ) , 0 . 02 M HEPES ( Gibco cat . no . 15630080 ) and 1 % penicillin – streptomycin ( Gibco cat . no . 15140122 ) ; ESC medium was supplemented with PD0325901 ( 1 mM ) , CHIR99021 ( 3 mM , 2i ) and leukaemia inhibitory factor ( 0 . 1 mM , LIF ) ( ETX - 2iLIF ) . TSC medium was supplemented with FGF2 ( 25 ng ml – 1 ; Peprotech ) , FGF4 ( 25 ng ml – 1 ; Peprotech ) and heparin ( 1 μ g ml – 1 ; Sigma ) ( ETX - F42H ) . XEN cells were cultured on gelatinized tissue - culture - grade plates , in 70 % MEF - conditioned ETX medium ( C - ETX ) , without any additional supplements . Cell lines . Experiments were performed using mouse wild - type ES cells , Nodal HBE - YFP ES cells 18 , T : GFP ES cells 29 , CAG : GFP ES cells 30 , wild - type TS cells , wild - type XEN cells and EGFP XEN cells . Wild - type TS cells were a gift from J . Nichols ( University of Cambridge ) and EGFP XENs were a gift from P . Rugg - Gunn ( Babraham Institute ) . Preparing and plating cell suspensions for ‘AggreWell’ aggregation experiments . The full protocol was repeated independently in the University of Cambridge , Charité University and MaxPlanck Institute in Berlin , and is available on Protocol Exchange 31 . For AggreWell plate preparation , the manufacturer’s protocol was followed . Briefly , wells were rinsed with rinsing solution ( Stem Cell Technologies ) , centrifuged for 5 min at 2 , 000 g and incubated at room temperature in the tissue culture hood for 20 min . After incubation , the wells were washed with 2 ml of 1 × PBS . After PBS removal , 500 μ l of filtered C - ETX medium was added to each well and the plate was spun for 5 min at 2 , 000 g and then placed at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 until ready to use . ES and TS cell colonies were dissociated to single cells by incubation with 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA at 37 °C for 3 min . Cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min at 1 , 000 r . p . m . and resuspended in MEF - conditioned ETX medium ( C - ETX , as above ) . Cell suspension was pre - incubated at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 on gelatinized tissue - culture - grade plates for 30 min to remove MEFs until re - collection of ES and TS cell suspensions . Meanwhile , XEN cells were dissociated to single cells by incubation with 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA at 37 °C for 3 min , and pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min / 1 , 000 r . p . m . and resuspended in C - ETX medium . A total of 7 , 200 ES cells per well , 19 , 200 TS cells per well and 5 , 400 XEN cells per well were counted using a haemocytometer . ES , TS and XEN cell suspensions were then mixed and repelleted . The cell mixture was resuspended in ETX medium ( C - ETX medium ) consisting of 70 % MEF - conditioned DMEM with 12 . 5 % FBS , 2 mM GlutaMax , 0 . 1 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ( 2 - ME ) , 0 . 1 mM nonessential amino acids , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 0 . 02 M HEPES , plus ROCK inhibitor ( Y27632 ; Stemgent , 5 nM ) , and added dropwise to the well . The AggreWell plate was centrifuged for 3 min at 100 g , outside wells were filled with PBS to prevent evaporation , and plates were placed at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . On the following day ( day 1 ) , 1 ml of medium from each well was slowly removed and replaced with 1 ml of fresh medium without ROCK inhibitor . This step was performed a second time to fully remove the ROCK inhibitor . On day 2 , 1 mL of C - ETX medium was replaced with 1 mL of fresh medium . On day 3 , the media was changed to IVC1 ( Cell Guidance Systems ) by removing 1 . 2 mL of media and replacing it with 1 . 5 mL of IVC1 medium . On day 4 , IVC1 was replaced with IVC2 by removing 1 . 2 mL of media and replacing it with 1 . 5 mL of IVC2 ( Cell Guidance Systems ) . On days 5 and 6 , 1 mL of IVC2 was replaced with 1 mL of fresh IVC2 . Immunofluorescence staining . ETX and natural embryos were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature , washed twice in PBT ( PBS plus 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ) and permeabilized for 30 min at room temperature in 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % glycin . Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer ( PBS plus 10 % FBS , 1 % Tween - 20 ) . The next day , embryos were washed twice in PBT , then incubated overnight with secondary antibody ( 1 : 500 ) in blocking buffer at 4 °C . On day 3 , embryos were washed NATuRE CELL BioLoGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Technical RepoRT NaTurE CEll Biology Functional enrichment analysis . Functional enrichment of gene sets identified as differentially expressed between samples was performed using the Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery v6 . 8 ( DAVID v6 . 8 ) 41 . Zip code mapping and corn plot analysis to compare side 1 and side 2 of ETX embryos to regions of the epiblast . Transcriptome data from each side of the ETX embryos were compared to embryo samples at three different stages ( E6 . 5 : 13 laser capture microdissection ( LCM ) samples ; E7 . 0 : 42 LCM samples ; E7 . 5 : 46 LCM samples ) . The reference embryo samples were subdivided into different epiblast regions as previously described 27 . To assess the similarity between ETX embryos and natural embryo samples , a Pearson correlation coefficient ( PCC ) was calculated as a measure of the correlation between the gene expression of reference embryo samples ( E6 . 5 : 13 samples ; E7 . 0 : 42 samples ; E7 . 5 : 46 samples ) and transcriptome data from cells isolated from each side of the ETX embryos . A PCC of 1 indicated that the gene expression pattern of a sample taken from the ETX embryo and a region of the epiblast were identical , and therefore the two were perfectly correlated . Conversely , a PCC of 0 would indicate no correlation . Therefore , a high PCC value reflects closely matching gene expression patterns between the ETX embryo samples and post - implantation reference samples , whereas a low PCC reflects no match . This PCC was calculated based on the expression of ‘zip code’ genes identified as robust markers of different regions of the epiblast of the post - implantation embryo 27 . The PCC values for each side of the ETX embryo sample compared to each region of the epiblast for each reference embryo was depicted in the form of a ‘corn plot’ using MATLAB ( version 2015a ) 27 . Building the NJ tree . For combined ETX embryo and natural embryo samples , we first removed batch effects with ComBat ( package in R ) if individual samples were from different batches . Then , the Euclidean distance of any two samples was calculated based on DEGs , and then fed into MEGA ( version : 7 . 0 ) software to build the NJ tree ( under the Phylogeny menu ) . Statistics and reproducibility . Statistical tests were performed on GraphPad Prism 7 . 0 software for Windows . Data were checked for normal distribution and equal variances before each parametric statistical test was performed . Qualitative data are presented as a contingency table and were analysed with Fisher’s exact test . Where appropriate , Student’s t - tests ( two groups ) or analysis of variance ( multiple groups ) were performed with Welch’s correction if variance between groups was not equal . Error bars represent s . e . m . or s . d . as specified . Figure legends indicate the number of independent experiments performed in each analysis . Unless otherwise noted , each experiment was performed at least three times . Data availability .

Mitosis in mesoderm regions in ETX embryos and E6 . 75 embryos . Cells positive for H3S10 - P protein expression were counted in the mesoderm region and outside this region . This procedure was repeated for three chosen z planes . Z planes were selected from the top ( 1 / 3 of total ) , middle ( 2 / 3 of the total ) or end ( 3 / 3 of the total ) region of each ETX embryo or natural embryo , and the values obtained were averaged . Student’s t - test was performed . Time - lapse imaging . Confocal time - lapse imaging during ETX embryo culture was performed using a spinning - disc microscope ( 3i ) , using a Zeiss EC Plan - NEOFLUAR × 20 / 0 . 5 objective . The embryos were imaged every 45 min in 100 μ m image stacks of 4 μ m z planes . Images were processed using Slidebook 5 . 0 ( 3i ) . Cell tracking time - lapse images were captured using an inverted SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica Microsystems ) , using a Leica Fluotar VISIR 0 . 95 NA × 25 objective . Images were acquired in 6 min intervals with a z step of 1 μ m . ETX embryos were imaged in a humidified chamber with 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 . Whole mount in situ hybridization ( WMISH ) . WMISH was performed exactly as previously described 32 , with the only difference that the 10 × DIG ( digoxigenin ) - blocking solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of blocking reagent in 10 ml of malate buffer . Samples were digested with proteinase K for 3 min at room temperature with rocking . The probe for Cerl was provided by E . De Robertis , the probe for Nodal was provided by H . Hamada , the probes for Wnt3 and Bmp4 were provided by J . Rivera , and the probes for Cripto and T were provided by T . Rodriguez . Cell isolation and qRT – PCR . After 5 or 6 days of culture , ETX embryos were collected . Asymmetric T expression was confirmed under a fluorescent microscope , and the TS compartment was dissected away . The ES compartment was cut through a line corresponding to the long axis , equivalent to the midline of an ETX embryo ( perpendicular to the embryonic – extra - embryonic boundary ) . T : GFP - positive and negative domains were collected separately and transferred into lysis buffer ( Life Technologies ) . Total RNA was extracted with the Arcturus Pico Pure RNA Isolation Kit , and qRT – PCR was performed with the Power SYBR Green RNA - to - CT 1 - Step Kit ( Life Technologies ) and a Step One Plus Real - time PCR machine ( Applied Biosystems ) . The amounts of mRNA were measured with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( Ambion ) . Relative levels of transcript expression were assessed by the Δ Δ Ct method , with GADPH as endogenous control . For the qPCR primers used , see Supplementary Table 2 . Sample collection and RNA isolation . To collect RNA for RNA – seq , ETX embryos generated using a T / Brachyury - GFP reporter ES line were collected and TS compartments were dissected away . The ES compartment was further dissected in half on the long side and each half was analysed separately under a fluorescent microscope to identify GFP + ve ( prospective posterior ) and GFP − ve ( prospective anterior ) cells . Samples were collected in lysis buffer ( 2 . 3 μ l of 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma ) supplemented with 1 U μ l − 1 RNAsIN ( Ambion ) ) and stored at − 80 °C until library preparation . Library preparation , RNA – seq and mapping of reads . Low - input RNA – seq was performed using the Smart - seq2 protocol 33 , 34 , using 18 cycles of amplification in the PCR preamplification step . A pool of indexed libraries was sequenced on a HiSeq2500 in rapid run mode . Reads were mapped to the Mus musculus genome ( Ensembl version 38 . 77 ) and quantified using the HTSeq - count 35 . Quality assessment and preprocessing of RNA – seq data . The quality of the reads was evaluated using the FASTQC tool 36 . The density distribution of gene expression for all samples was also plotted to assess sample consistency . Raw reads were mapped to the mm10 version of the mouse genome using the Tophat2 v2 . 0 . 4 program 37 . Samples with raw sequencing reads count of > 10 million and mapping ratio of > 50 % were retained for further analysis . We calculated the fragment per kilobase per million ( FPKM ) as expression level using Cufflinks v2 . 0 . 2 with default parameters 38 . Genes with FPKM value > 1 . 0 in at least one sample across all samples were retained for further analysis . Finally , the expression levels were transformed to logarithmic space by using log 2 ( FPKM + 1 ) . With these criteria , three ETX embryos were retained for further analysis ( ETX - A , ETX - B and ETX - C ) and , because they were cut in half , each side was arbitrarily called side 1 or side 2 . Principal component analysis . PCA was based on all the expressed genes as described in the RNA – seq data preprocessing and was performed using the FactoMineR package in R . Differentially expressed gene analysis . DEGs between ETX embryo side 1 and ETX embryo side 2 were identified using RankProd 39 with P value of < 0 . 05 and fold change of > 1 . 5 . Heatmaps were generated using Cluster 3 . 0 and JavaTreeView 40 . NATuRE CELL BioLoGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Technical RepoRT NaTurE CEll Biology 40 . Saldanha , A . J .

Sample size No statistical method was performed to predetermine sample size . Sample size for each experiment described in the paper based on our previous experience and the work of other groups using embryos and stem cells as experimental model systems . Data exclusions Culture experiments : on principle , data were only excluded for failed experiments , reasons for which included suboptimal culture conditions . ETX embryo samples for deep - sequencing analysis : those samples that did not pass the quality controls were excluded from the analysis The quality of the reads was evaluated using the FASTQC tool . Density distribution of gene expression for all samples was also plotted to assess sample consistency . Raw reads were mapped to mm10 version of the mouse genome using the Tophat2 v2 . 0 . 4 program . Samples with raw sequencing reads count > 10 million and mapping ratio > 50 % were retained for further analysis . We calculated fragment per kilobase per million ( FPKM ) as expression level using Cufflinks v2 . 0 . 2 with default parameters . Genes with the FPKM value > 1 . 0 in at least one sample across all samples were retained for further analysis . Finally , the expression levels were transformed to logarithmic space by using log2 ( FPKM + 1 ) . With these criteria , 3 gastrulating ETX embryos were retained for further analysis ( GE - A , GE - B and GE - C ) and since they were cut in half , each side was arbitrarily called side 1 or side 2 . Replication In the study , all attempts at replication were successful . Each result described in the paper is based on at least two independent biological replicates but very often an experiment is based on more 3 n a t u r e r e s e a r c h | r e p o r t i n g s u mm a r y A p r il 2018 than two experiments . Figure legends indicate the number of independent experiments performed in each analysis . Randomization For experiments were our samples were exposed to chemical inhibitors , samples were randomly allocated to control and experimental groups . Blinding Investigators were not blinded . This study compares ETX embryos to natural embryos . The experiments were descriptive in nature .

Eukaryotic cell lines Policy information about cell lines Cell line source ( s ) The following cell lines were used : Mouse embryonic stem cells : E14 WT mESCs ( kindly provided by Prof . Austin Smith , Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge , UK ) , Nodal HBE - YFP ESCs and T : GFP ESCs kindly provided by Dr . Alfonso Martinez Arias , Cambridge , UK ) Mouse trophoblast stem cells : wild - type TSCs ( a gift from Jenny Nichols , University of Cambridge , UK ) Mouse extraembryonic endoderm cells : wild - type XENs ( a gift from Ellen Na , University of Charité , Germany ) and EGFP XENs ( a gift from Dr .
