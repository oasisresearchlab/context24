That being said , there are several negative consequences as well such as online harassment , trolling , cyber - bullying , fake news , and hate speech . Out of these , hate speech presents a unique challenge as it is deeply engraved into our society and is often linked with offline violence . Social media platforms rely on human moderators to identify hate speech and take necessary action . However , with the increase in online hate speech , these platforms are turning toward automated hate speech detection and mitigation systems . This shift brings several chal - lenges to the plate , and hence , is an important avenue to explore for the computation social science community . In this tutorial , we present an exposition of hate speech detec - tion and mitigation in three steps . First , we describe the current state of research in the hate speech domain , focusing on different hate speech detection and mitigation systems that have developed over time . Next , we highlight the challenges that these systems might carry like bias and the lack of transparency . The final sec - tion concretizes the path ahead , providing clear guidelines for the community working in hate speech and related domains . We also outline the open challenges and research directions for interested researchers .

While , there are many positive aspects like large audience for small business , rejuvenating friendships and unfolding new collabora - tions , social media platforms are also riddled with the rise of in - appropriate content like abusive language , hate speech etc . Hate speech has also been linked to different offline violence like the Pittsburgh shooting 2 , Rohingya incident 3 , New Zealand mosque shooting 4 and mob lynching in India 5 . Traditionally , these plat - forms rely on moderators to maintain the civility online , but in most cases this seems inadequate . Recently , many social media platforms are shifting to automated filtering systems 6 . While these automatic detection systems can handle large amount of posts , the problem arises due to the veracity of languages and the nuances of the individual platforms . Once hate speech has been identified , a common remedy is to remove or suspend the users but this does not actually solve the problem . Most often the banned users shift to other open platforms , further aggravating the problem [ 2 ] . Another form of remedy is counter speech , i . e . , countering the hate speech with more speech . Different studies have tried to research on coun - terspeechdetection [ 16 ] as well as synthetically generating such speech [ 27 ] . Nowadays many platforms 7 also promote the use of counter speech , although further research is required to understand the effect of the same on the community [ 7 ] . This tutorial is aimed at providing a holistic overview of the hate speech domain in a hierarchical fashion . We first begin with 1 https : / / carrierclinic . org / 2019 / 08 / 08 / the - good - bad - and - in - between - of - social - media / 2 https : / / www . nytimes . com / 2018 / 10 / 27 / us / active - shooter - pittsburgh - synagogue - shooting . html 3 https : / / www . bbc . com / news / world - asia - 18395788 4 https : / / www . bbc . com / news / topics / c966094wvmqt / christchurch - mosque - shootings 5 https : / / www . thequint . com / quintlab / lynching - in - india / 6 https : / / www . forbes . com / sites / niallmccarthy / 2020 / 05 / 13 / facebook - removes - record - number - of - hate - speech - posts - infographic / 7 https : / / counterspeech . fb . com / en / 1232 WSDM ’23 , February 27 - March 3 , 2023 , Singapore , Singapore Punyajoy Saha , Mithun Das , Binny Mathew , & Animesh Mukherjee Analysis where we discuss how different research works have anal - ysed the prevalence and effect of hate speech . Then , we move to Detection covering traditional and current methods to detect hate speech . We further highlight the challenges in detection in the form of evaluation , explainability and bias . The third part focuses on cur - rent methods of Moderation of hate speech and how counterspeech may be a good alternative . The tutorial shall be concluded with a SWOT analysis 8 about research in hate speech domain . We believe that this holistic approach will be beneficial for both newcomers and experienced researchers in the field . 2 OUTLINE In this translation style tutorial , we present an exposition of hate speech detection and mitigation in three steps . The following sec - tion presents a detailed plan for the tutorial : - 2 . 1 Introduction This section will cover the scientific interest in hate speech and various definitions of hate speech . This section will help you un - derstand the outline and what to take home from this tutorial . 2 . 2 Analysis In this section , we analyze the spread of hate speech in online social media platforms like Twitter , Facebook , Gab etc . We observe that hate speech is spreading through online communities at an alarm - ing rate . These hateful users are well connected among themselves and are reaching a wider audience . This case is more severe in moderation free platforms like Gab , Bitchute etc . The target com - munities of such hate are minorities such as the Muslims , Jews , Africans etc . This section is further divided into the following parts . • Prevalence of hate speech [ 6 , 14 , 31 ] . • Targets of hate speech [ 20 , 26 ] . • Effects of hate speech [ 12 , 23 ] . • Effect of offline events [ 19 ] . 2 . 3 Detection Hate speech detection is a challenging task . We now have several datasets available based on different criteria – language , domain , modalities etc . Several models ranging from simple bag of words to complex ones like BERT have been used for the task . The task performance seems to be improving over time , however , there are issues like generalizability , bias and explainability of the models . This section is further divided into – • Brief summary of different datasets [ 5 , 29 , 30 ] . • Earlier detection models [ 5 , 25 ] . • Current detection models ( based on transformers ) [ 11 , 18 ] • Multimodal and multilingual hate speech [ 1 , 10 ] . • Challenge : Evaluation , explainability and bias [ 4 , 17 ] . 2 . 4 Mitigation To deter the spread of hate speech , organizations have adopted several policies . These include the general policies like deletion of posts and / or accounts , shadow banning to softer approaches like 8 https : / / www . businessnewsdaily . com / 4245 - swot - analysis . html counterspeech . Policies like banning / deletion seem to be effective in some cases , but there are issues of violation of freedom of speech . Recent research have started looking into automated generation of counterspeech as well . This section is further divided into the following parts . • Counterspeech campaigns 9 . • Banning and suspending users [ 3 ] . • Counterspeech detection [ 15 , 16 ] . • Counterspeech generation [ 28 ] . • Effect of counterspeech [ 8 ] . 2 . 5 Road to the future We end this tutorial by covering the summary of the challenges and road to the future for hate speech research . For this purpose we use SWOT analysis to point out the strengths , weakness , op - portunities [ 21 , 24 ] and threats in the current hate speech research domain . 3 TARGET AUDIENCE The first part of the tutorial is targeted toward the newcomers in this field . Since this section covers a large part of the current research in hate speech domain , a minimal understanding of the natural language processing and network analysis will be required . This part is potentially beneficial to newcomers as well as experienced researchers who are planning to start research in this area and wish to have a comprehensive review therefore . The second section will interest social scientists , policy makers and computer scientists , as we discuss different challenges in the pipeline of hate speech detection . Some of these include the very recent concerns about the models being biased [ 32 ] or lacking transparency [ 22 ] . The third section is aimed at providing the future ahead and should be of interest to the entire audience . 3 . 1 Prerequisite knowledge We plan to keep our tutorial material comprehensive and self - contained . This would help the audience to assimilate the concepts well and reap the best harvest from the tutorial . We expect our audience to have basic understanding of NLP , social network and familiarity with python language . 4 RELATED TUTORIALS Our contributions : We have already presented two tutorials on hate speech at AAAI 2022 10 and ICWSM 2021 11 , which was a huge success . We had more than 150 registrants for both the tutorials . We except a similar or higher level of participation at WSDM . Others : Besides our tutorials , other organizers also delivered sim - ilar tutorials due to the significance of the topic . In 2018 , the de - tection and mitigation of a related concept cyberbullying 12 , were presented . Another tutorial studied fake news and hate speech but mostly covered the topic from an introductory point of view [ 9 ] . A third tutorial was held at WSDM 2022 on ‘Combating Online Hate Speech’ [ 13 ] ; while we did not find the material of this tutorial on 9 https : / / www . coe . int / en / web / no - hate - campaign 10 https : / / hate - alert . github . io / talk / aaai _ tutorial / 11 https : / / hate - alert . github . io / talk / icwsm _ tutorial / 12 http : / / www . cs . albany . edu / ~ cchelmis / icwsm2018tutorial / 1233 Hate Speech : Detection , Mitigation and Beyond WSDM ’23 , February 27 - March 3 , 2023 , Singapore , Singapore the website 13 , a comparison of the table of contents indicates that the coverage has been sufficiently different from what we plan to outline . 5 TUTORIAL MATERIALS We already have created a completely searchable repository of the papers that we shall refer to in the tutorial 14 , categorized into differ - ent types , conferences , and years which will help the researchers to stay updated in this field . We have been maintaining the repository since our first tutorial and keeping it updated with new relevant papers . Our vision is to create a one - stop solution for researchers in this field . All the models that we shall discuss are open source and we have provided a demo on how to use the models in this github repository 15 . 5 . 1 Format & Detailed Schedule Below we show the outline of the tutorial , including the duration .
