Ort , Datum Uta Fuchs Summary Summary It has long been established that fungal growth and pathogenic development are supported by exocytosis . However , the role of endocytosis during these growth processes has not been elucidated yet . It was the aim of the present study to use the temperature - sensitive mutant of the endocytic t - SNARE Yup1 , to analyse the importance of endocytosis for fungal growth and pathogenic development in Ustilago maydis . U . maydis is a basidiomycete fungus that infects maize plants and causes the formation of tumors in the corncob and other parts of the plant . Pathogenic development is initiated by pheromone recognition of compatible haploid partner cells . Yup1 ts cells are defective in pheromone recognition and do not initiate the subsequent mating reaction . Key player for pheromone recognition is the G - protein coupled pheromone receptor Pra1 . In the absence of pheromone , biologically active Pra1 - GFP is constitutively endocytosed from the plasma membrane and degraded in the vacuole . After pheromone ligand binding , growth of conjugation hyphae is initiated and Pra1 - GFP localises to the tip of conjugation hyphae while in yup1 ts cells , Pra1 - GFP accumulates in small endocytic vesicles , which are no longer able to fuse with early endosomes . These findings suggest a role for Yup1 on early endosomes at the intersection of incoming endocytic vesicles and the degradation pathway as well as a putative recycling pathway . Therefore recycling and degradation of Pra1 are inhibited in yup1 ts cells . In an independent experiment it was found that wild - type Pra1 - GFP is recycled . Thus it is thought that Pra1 - GFP is depleted from the plasma membrane due to malfunction of Yup1 . The recycling deficiency of Pra1 - GFP in yup1 ts results in the defect in pheromone perception . Interestingly , increased expression of Pra1 - GFP can rescue this perception defect . However , even the restored partner recognition could not resolve the subsequent mating defects identified for cell - cell fusion , while filamentous growth , formation of appressoria and plant infection which follow cell - cell fusion , are only affected to a small extend . Interestingly , the tumors that are formed in the maize plant after Ustilago I Summary infection are empty , indicating a lack of teliospore formation in the absence of yup1 - mediated endocytosis . Independently , germination of teliospores is reduced and the promycelium shows morphological alterations in yup1 ts cells . Endocytosed cargos responsible for these phenotypes have not been determined so far . First indications point to an involvement of chitin synthases . One of their representatives , the myosin chitin synthase 1 ( Mcs1 ) was shown to be endocytosed in a yup1 - mediated fashion . The presented results are supported by the analysis of the U . maydis genome , which reveals the presence of components commonly discussed to mediate endocytosis . Taken together the results clearly proof the existence and the importance of endocytosis for growth and virulence in the filamentous fungus U . maydis . II Zusammenfassung Zusammenfassung Das Wachstum und die pathogene Entwicklung von Pilzen werden durch Exozytose unterstützt während die Rolle der Endozytose für diese Vorgänge weitgehend unbekannt ist . Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es , mit Hilfe der temperatursensitiven endozytotischen t - SNARE Mutante Yup1 , den Einfluss von Endozytose auf pilzliches Wachstum und Pathogenität in Ustilago maydis zu untersuchen . U . maydis , ein Vertreter der Gruppe der Basidiomyceten , ist der Erreger des Maisbeulenbrandes . Die pathogene Entwicklung des Pilzes wird eingeleitet , wenn zwei kompatible haploide Zellen aufeinandertreffen und sich über einen Pheromon - erkennungsmechanismus wahrnehmen . Zellen der Yup1 ts Mutante sind nicht in der Lage den Partner zu finden und eine Paarungsreaktion zu vollziehen . Der G - Protein gekoppelte Pheromonrezeptor Pra1 ist eine der Schlüsselkomponenten für diesen Vorgang . Es wurde gefunden , dass biologisch aktives Pra1 , fusioniert mit dem grünfluoreszierenden Protein GFP ( Pra1 - GFP ) , in der Abwesenheit von Pheromon konstitutiv von der Plasmamembran endozytiert und in der Vakuole degradiert wird . Nachdem Pheromon als Ligand von Pra1 - Rezeptor gebunden wurde , bilden sich Konjugationshyphen an deren Spitze Pra1 - GFP lokalisiert . In yup1 ts Zellen akkumuliert Pra1 - GFP in primär - endozytotischen Vesikeln , welche nicht länger dazu in der Lage sind , mit frühen Endosomen zu fusionieren . Diese Ergebnisse legen nahe , dass Yup1 eine Funktion an frühen Endosomen besitzt , die die Schnittstelle zwischen den hereinkommenden primär - endozytotischen Vesikeln und dem Abbauweg sowie einem möglichen Weg der Molekül - Wiederverwertung der Zelle bildet . Sowohl die Wiederverwertung als auch der Abbau von Pra1 - GFP sind deshalb in yup1 ts Zellen nicht funktional . In einem unabhängigen Experiment konnte nachgewiesen werden , dass Pra1 unter natürlichen Bedingungen wiederverwertet wird . Es wird deshalb angenommen , dass Pra1 - GFP durch die gestörte Funktion von Yup1 von der Plasmamembran dezimiert wird . Ein Defekt in der Pra1 Wiederverwertung ist schließlich sehr wahrscheinlich dafür verantwortlich , dass yup1 ts Zellen kein Pheromon perzipieren können . Interessanter Weise kann eine Überexpression von Pra1 - GFP diesen Defekt wiederausgleichen . III Zusammenfassung Die wiederhergestellte Partnererkennung ist jedoch nicht ausreichend , um Defekte zu überbrücken , die während der nachfolgenden Paarungsreaktion in der Abwesenheit von Endozytose auftreten . Während dessen sind das filamentöse Wachstum , die Bildung von Appressorien and die Pflanzeninfektion , die sich an die Zell - Zellfusion anschließen , in der yup1 ts Mutante nur zu einem kleinen Teil beeinträchtigt . Die Gallen , die nach der Pilzinfektion mit yup1 ts Zellen von der Maispflanze gebildet werden , enthalten allerdings keine Teliosporen . Unabhängig davon ist die Auskeimung der Teliosporen verringert und das sich bildende Promyzel zeigt morphologische Defekte . Mögliche Komponenten , die für diese Phänotypen verantwortlich sind , wurden noch nicht identifiziert . Es gibt jedoch Hinweise darauf , dass Chitinsynthasen involviert sind . Für einen Vertreter dieser Gruppe , die Myosin - Chitinsynthase 1 ( Mcs1 ) , konnte eine yup1 - abhängige Endozytose nachgewiesen werden . Die vorgestellten Resultate werden durch U . maydis Genomanalysen unterstützt . Sie zeigen , dass allgemein bekannte Proteine des Endozytoseapparates vorhanden sind , Zusammengefasst weisen die Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit darauf hin , dass Endozytose in Pilzen existiert und eine große Relevanz für das Wachstum und die pathogene Entwicklung des filamentösen Pilzes U . maydis hat .

cellular process that allows the eukaryotic cell to take up extra - cellular compounds and to internalise plasma membrane components and receptor - associated ligands . Primarily , endocytosis provides the means to maintain cellular homeostasis by recovery of protein and lipid components , which have been inserted into the plasma membrane by secretion . Furthermore , activities that involve the transmission of metabolic and proliferative signals , the uptake of nutrients and the regulated interaction with the surrounding environment are facilitated by endocytosis ( Mellman , 1996 ) . 1 . 1 Receptor mediated endocytosis There are several mechanisms for internalisation of molecules and their delivery to various intracellular destinations . One very well understood endocytic process is the receptor - mediated ligand endocytosis , a process that is largely analogous between animal systems and the well - studied yeast model Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( reviewed in Geli and Riezman , 1998 ) . In general two distinct modes of receptor - mediated endocytosis are known : a ligand - independent , constitutive uptake mode as well as a ligand - dependent mode . The trans - membrane bound G - protein coupled pheromone receptors Ste2p and Ste3p of S . cerevisiae have been studied as an example of these two processes . Here , constitutive endocytosis is rapid and the receptors are directly delivered to the vacuole after a short surface residency ( Davis et al . , 1993 ; Roth and Davis , 1996 ; Roth et al . , 1998 ; Roth and Davis , 2000 ) . During constitutive pheromone receptor endocytosis receptor internalisation is triggered by ubiquitin , which is added to the surface localised receptor and serves as internalisation signal ( Roth and Davis , 1996 ; Roth et al . , 1998 ; Roth and Davis , 2000 ) . Ligand - induced pheromone receptor endocytosis on the other hand takes place after binding of the yeast mating pheromone . A specific internalisation signal encoded by the receptor , is exposed after ligand binding and subsequently induces receptor - ligand internalisation ( Chen and Davis , 2000 ) . In higher 1 Introduction eukaryotic systems especially the ligand - induced mode of receptor endocytosis is described . Prominent examples for this mode are the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , the low density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLR ) and the transferrin receptor ( summarized in Mellman , 1996 ) . In both the ligand - independent and the ligand - dependent endocytic pathway , internalisation of the receptor alone or the receptor - ligand complexes occurs by their clustering into specific plasma membrane domains ( Anderson et al . , 1977 ; Goldstein et al . , 1979 ; Maxfield and McGraw , 2004 ) . One such membrane domain are eisosomes that have been described very recently as static sites of endocytosis in S . cerevisiae ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) . Following the clustering , internalisation of the components requires the interplay between a large number of different proteins ( summarized in D ' Hondt et al . , 2000 ) . The initial steps of endocytosis are actin dependent and result in budding of most often clathrin - coated , membrane bound vesicles ( = primary endocytic vesicles , PEV ) into the cytoplasm ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Huckaba et al . , 2004 ; Lakadamyali et al . , 2006 ; Toshima et al . , 2006 ) . The vesicles , which contain the receptor complexes , subsequently loose their clathrin coat ( Bonifacino and Lippincott - Schwartz , 2003 ) and become part of the endosomal pathway by fusion with each other and with the early endosomes ( EE ) . In the mammalian system , EE form a sorting compartment that contains two populations of organelles with distinct mobility and maturation kinetics : ( 1 ) the sorting endosomes and ( 2 ) the endocytic recycling compartment ( Sheff et al . , 1999 ; Lakadamyali et al . , 2006 ) . They represent the first intersection between the recycling and the degradative pathways and mediate appropriate targeting of molecules ( Fig . 1 ) . However , in the yeast model , early endosomes have not been distinguished into a sorting and a recycling compartment ( Prescianotto - Baschong and Riezman , 1998 ; Mulholland et al . , 1999 ; Pelham , 2002 ) . Ligands dissociate from their receptors due to the acidic environment of the sorting endosome ( Mukherjee et al . , 1997 ) . As a consequence of sorting endosome maturation , the ligands and a subset of membrane proteins migrate to multivesicular bodies and subsequently turn to become late endosomes ( LE ) ( Katzmann et al . , 2002 ) . They are finally converted to lysosomes / vacuoles by their fusion with hydrolase - bearing transport vesicles from the trans Golgi network ( Geuze et al . , 1985 ; Geuze et al . , 1988 ) . Proteins , such as a chimeric form of furin , can also directly cycle form the 2 Introduction plasma membrane via late endosomes to the Golgi and back to the plasma membrane ( Mallet and Maxfield , 1999 ) . Figure 1 . Endocytosis and endocytic recycling pathways in higher eukaryotes . Routes taken by the endocytosed cargo are delineated by arrows , detailed information on the pathways are given in the text . The illustration was modified from Maxfield and McGraw , 2004 ) . In higher eukaryotic systems , the transport of the different organelles in the endocytic pathway depends on the microtubule cytoskeleton ( Aniento et al . , 1993 ) , ( Lakadamyali et al . , 2006 ) . The delivery of membrane proteins to late endosomes requires specific targeting information such as ubiquitylation . This has been described for signalling receptors and additionally represents a way to terminate signalling and to make the cells unresponsive to the specific stimulus ( Katzmann et al . , 2002 ) . This overall pathway describes the main routes of molecules , but it needs to be noted that sorting mechanisms are not 100 % efficient and that all compartments are dynamic which means that no molecules will be permanently resident of a compartment ( Maxfield and McGraw , 2004 ) . 3 Introduction 1 . 2 Endocytic receptor recycling While ligands are degraded in the lysosome / vacuole , receptors dissociate from their ligand and can directly be routed back to the plasma membrane or delivered to the long - lived , microtubule - dependent endocytic recycling compartment before their return to the plasma membrane ( Hopkins , 1983 ; Yamashiro et al . , 1984 ) . It is thought that such a recycling of components is essential to maintain the proper composition of various organelles and for the return of molecules with essential functions at the appropriate compartments . In addition , recycling of receptors allows the receptor protein to participate in multiple rounds of ligand binding and internalisation ( Ciechanover et al . , 1983 ; Goldstein et al . , 1985 ) . Recycling may also be used for resensitation , in case of the β 2 - adrenergic receptor , uncoupling of the heterotrimeric G protein , dephosphorylation and subsequent return to the plasma membrane restore the original responsiveness of the receptor ( von Zastrow and Kobilka , 1992 ) . It has been suggested that the mode of receptor recycling seems to be a default route . Unless the receptor bears a cytoplasmic signal that directs its sorting to LE , it is returned to the plasma membrane via the endosomal recycling compartment . Recycling receptors concentrate in specific domains of sorting endosomes suggesting for the interaction of a specific sorting signal with an endosome - associated adaptor complex ( Geuze et al . , 1987 ) . Alternatively , the recycling tubules represent domains that concentrate the receptor in an adaptor independent fashion ( summarized by Mellman , 1996 ) . Some receptors like the epidermal growth factor receptor await a mixed outcome with some of the receptor being reused and some being degraded in the lysosome ( Jiansong Xie , 2004 ) . 1 . 3 Regulation and specificity of endocytosis Several groups of proteins are required to confer specificity and regulation during endocytic sorting and membrane trafficking . S oluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor ( NSF ) a ccessory protein re ceptors [ SNAREs ] play a crucial role in intracellular membrane fusion ( Rothman , 1994 ) . They are related membrane - anchored proteins that contain a coiled - coiled domain the so - called “SNARE” motif . The SNARE motif becomes part of a four helix bundle formed by SNAREs of the v esicle ( = v - SNARE ) 4 Introduction and the t arget ( = t - SNARE ) membranes . This interaction is thought to draw the membranes into close apposition and initiate membrane fusion ( Sutton et al . , 1998 ; Jahn and Sudhof , 1999 ) . The majority of membrane - traffic components in the endocytic pathway recognize the correct organelle by binding to either specific lipids , such as phosphoinositides , or to activated forms of RabGTPases ( summarized by Behnia and Munro , 2005 ) . Both lipids and GTPases provide each organelle with a unique identity that will be recognized by the many proteins that act on its cytosolic surface . Most important among the lipids are the phosphoinositides . They are forms of phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) with phosphate attached by specific kinases to the 3 , 4 or 5 positions of the inositol ring ( summarized by Niggli , 2005 ) . PtdIns ( 3 ) P , for example , is present on EE and is recognized by a broad range of peripheral membrane proteins with a FYVE or Phox ( PX ) domain ( Ellson et al . , 2002 ; Stenmark et al . , 2002 ; Gillooly et al . , 2003 ) . RabGTPases are key regulators of endocytic vesicle generation and vesicle transport between different sub - cellular compartments in the eukaryotic cell . They mediate vesicle budding from the donor membrane , movement to as well as tethering and docking with the acceptor membrane and subsequent fusion of the two vesicle membranes . RabGTPases cycle between an inactive GDP bound and an active GTP bound form ( Vetter and Wittinghofer , 2001 ) . One of the endocytic Rab proteins , Rab5 , mediates fusion and fission of early endosomes ( Bucci et al . , 1992 ) as well as their transport along microtubules ( Nielsen et al . , 1999 ) Two other Rab proteins , Rab4 and Rab11 , are responsible for the regulation of endocytic recycling from the sorting endosome and the endocytic recycling compartment , respectively ( Van Der Sluijs et al . , 1991 ; Mohrmann and van der Sluijs , 1999 ; Sönnichsen et al . , 2000 ; Wilcke et al . , 2000 ) . Rab7 specifically locates to late endosomes ( Rink et al . , 2005 ) while Rab9 mediates transport from LE to the Golgi ( Lombardi et al . , 1993 ; Riederer et al . , 1994 ) . 1 . 4 Endocytosis in filamentous fungi As described above , endocytosis is a common cellular pathway among eukaryotes with conserved mechanisms between mammalian systems and the fungal yeast model S . cerevisiae ( Geli and Riezman , 1998 ) . Despite the great importance of filamentous fungi and structural similarities to higher mammalian systems such as the neuron , the 5 Introduction existence of endocytosis in this group of organisms has long been a matter of debate ( Read and Kalkman , 2003 ) . Filamentous fungi are widespread and ancient species that include symbiontic and benefical species as well as animal and plant parasites . They invade substrates , including the host tissue , by directed invasive growth . Fungal hyphae expand at their apex which is similar to tip - growing plant cells , such as pollen tubes or root hairs ( Geitmann and Emons , 2000 ; Hepler et al . , 2001 ) . This filamentous growth is supported by polarized exocytosis at the hyphal tip ( Gow , 1995a ) . An accumulation of membranous organelles , the so - called Spitzenkörper ( Reinhard , 1892 ; Girbardt , 1957 ) that might consist of secretory vesicles ( Bartnicki - Garcia et al . , 1995 ) is present at the growth region . However , hyphal tips can expand at rates up to 18 . 5 µm min - 1 ( Carlile and Watkinson , 1994 ) and it has long been speculated that this rapid polarized growth requires the endocytic uptake and recycling of wall - components , such as synthetic enzymes ( Wessels , 1986 ) . The first indications for endocytosis in filamentous fungi came from the work of Hoffmann and Mendgen ( 1998 ) and Steinberg and co - workers ( Steinberg et al . , 1998 ) , who could demonstrate that the endocytic marker dyes FM 4 - 64 and Lucifer Yellow are taken up into the plant pathogenic fungi Uromyces fabae and Ustilago maydis , respectively . Similar studies in other fungal species have suggested that endocytosis is a common process in filamentous fungi such as Magnaporthe grisea , Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus nidulans ( Cole et al . , 1998 ; Fischer - Parton et al . , 2000 ; Atkinson et al . , 2002 ; Read and Kalkman , 2003 ; Penalva , 2005 ) . Contradictory to the results above , ultrastructural and lightmicroscopy techniques applied by Torralba and Heath ( 2002 ) did not reveal any indications for endocytosis in N . crassa . However , first genomic evidence for endocytosis was provided by studies in U . maydis where it could be shown that conditional mutants defective in the uptake of components into early endosomes show a heavily altered morphology ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) . Higuchi et al . ( 2006 ) , who studied the internalisation and transport of the eGFP - fused plasma membrane bound purine transporter AoUapC in Aspergillus oryzae , further supported the existence of endocytosis in filamentous fungi . In the meantime screening the published fungal genomes for homologues of proteins involved in yeast endocytosis became a powerful tool to support the existence of endocytosis in filamentous fungi . Based on numerous studies it had been suggested 6 Introduction that about 2 % of the S . cerevisiae genome consist of genes that mediate endocytosis , which again points towards the significance of this basic cellular process ( D ' Hondt et al . , 2000 ) . ( Read and Kalkman ( 2003 ) did an extensive search for proteins involved in endocytosis in the recently published genomic sequence of N . crassa and concluded that essentially all important components of the endocytic machinery are present in this filamentous fungus . The advantage of a fully sequenced and accessible genome also applies to the phytopathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis for which a similar analysis was carried out ( Fuchs and Steinberg , 2005 and see below ) . 1 . 5 The corn smut fungus Ustilago maydis Ustilago maydis , a basidiomycete fungus , is a ubiquitous corn pathogen . The phytopathogenic fungus infects maize plants and causes tumor formation on the leaves , the stem and in the corncob of the plants . The tumors appear smutty and darkened due to the vast amount of black teliospores produced by the fungus , which are the infectious progeny . During its lifecycle U . maydis exists in three different , morphologically distinct growth forms : ( 1 ) yeast - like , haploid sporidia ( 2 ) conjugation hyphae and ( 3 ) dikaryotic filaments that are the result of conjugation hyphae fusion ( Snetselaar et al . , 1996 ) . For pathogenic development to occur two compatible haploid sporidia ( such as cells with mating type a1b1 and a2b2 ) have to recognize each other by a pheromone ( mfa1 / 2 ) – pheromone receptor ( Pra1 / Pra2 ) system ( Fig . 2 ) on the plant surface ( Bölker et al . , 1992 ) . In response to the mating pheromone the cells initiate a mating reaction . The mating reaction includes the signal transmission from the ligand bound pheromone receptor to components of the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway ( summarized by Kahmann and Kämper , 2004 ) . The cell cycle is arrested ( Garcia - Muse et al . , 2003 ) and conjugation hyphae that grow towards the partner cell along a pheromone gradient , are formed ( Spellig et al . , 1994 ; Snetselaar et al . , 1996 ) . These conjugation hyphae fuse and as a result an infectious dikaryotic filament develops ( Snetselaar et al . , 1996 ) , which is able to penetrate the maize plant on the surface . After growth and proliferation of the dikaryotic fungal mycelium within the plant , the characteristic tumors are formed . Subsequently , sporogenic hyphae that have developed within the tumor give rise to diploid teliospores . The teliospores are 7 Introduction released once the tumor breaks open . Teliospore germination then includes meiotic division , which originates the production of the haploid sporida ( summarized in Banuett and Herskowitz , 1996 ) . Figure 2 . Pheromone - pheromone receptor recognition in U . maydis . Two compatible haploid sporidia can initiate a mating reaction . The pheromone receptor Pra1 of one partner recognises the mfa2 pheromone of the other . In turn Pra2 expressed by the mating partner recognises mfa1 . Subsequently , growth towards the partner is initiated and is followed by cell - cell fusion . Over the last decades U . maydis became a valuable model organism for molecular biology studies in cell signalling and cell biology . Several different molecular techniques have been established for the analysis of gene function , which allows the study of essential cellular processes in this fungus ( summarized by Bölker , 2001 ; Kahmann and Kämper , 2004 ) . Due to a short generation time , the easy cultivation methods in axenic culture and the lifecycle of only three weeks U . maydis allows a thorough molecular analysis . Importantly , the different growth forms of U . maydis that do not require the plant environment ( stages prior plant penetration ) can be adequately analysed under laboratory conditions . The whole Ustilago genome sequence is now publicly available ( http : / / www . broad . mit . edu / annotation / genome / ustilago _ maydis / Home . html ) and is currently annotated and investigated ( Kämper et al . , in preparation ) . U . maydis has especially proven to be an excellent model for studies of the microtubule cytoskeleton . Microtubules and microtubule - dependent transport processes are essential for polar growth of U . maydis ( Steinberg et al . , 1998 ; Steinberg et al . , 2001 ; Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2002 ) . Furthermore , it could be shown that active endosome transport is mediated by the microtubule cytoskeleton and depends on the action of kinesin - 3 and cytoplasmic dynein ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2002 ) . Additionally , it has been suggested that a dynein loading zone for retrograde endosome transport 8 Introduction exists at the hyphal tip of growing filaments ( Lenz et al . , 2006 ) . Yup1 , a t - SNARE that resides on the bidirectionally moving endosomes was determined to be responsible for membrane turnover and recycling at this growth region ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) . It was the aim of the present study , to use the temperature - sensitive yup1 mutant to further extend the knowledge about endocytosis in the filamentous fungus U . maydis . The main emphasis in this respect was ( 1 ) to provide further evidence for endocytosis on a molecular level , ( 2 ) to elucidate the role of endocytosis for pathogenic development of U . maydis and ( 3 ) to identify endocytic cargoes that are essential for growth and pathogenicity of U . maydis . 9 Results 2 Results 2 . 1 Endocytosis in Ustilago maydis In order to gain further evidence for endocytosis I analysed the genome of U . maydis for components of the endocytic machinery ( Fuchs and Steinberg , 2005 ) . I used a two - way blast search analysis for which I chose reference proteins that have been identified as requirements for endocytosis in the related yeast S . cerevisae ( D ' Hondt et al . , 2000 ; Munn , 2000 ) . The protein sequences were first blasted against the U . maydis genome and the obtained homologues were confirmed by reblasting them against the yeast genome database . The retrieved proteins are listed in Table 1 . In addition , I could identify FYVE domain containing proteins that are specifically associated with EE ( Table 2 ) . For some of those proteins a closer homology existed to the appropriate human protein with which a similar blast analysis was done . The Ustilago genome also encodes for small RabGTPases that are known to regulate membrane traffic within eukaryotic cells ( Mohrmann and van der Sluijs , 1999 ) . As most of the characterisation of these Rab proteins was done in mammalian systems I additionally attempted a blast search with the human ( Hs ) Rabs against the Ustilago genome ( Table 1 displays Rab5 homologues of yeast proteins and Table 3 displays Rab homologues of the human proteins ) . Two Rab5 - like proteins , which share 55 % sequence identity , were identified in U . maydis . However , a Rab4 - like protein could only be identified by blast analysis with the human Rab4 while a homologue of Rab4 was not present in S . cerevisiae or any other Ascomycete . The overall phylogenetic relation of the yeast , human and Ustilago Rab proteins is summarized in Figure 3 . The predicted U . maydis ( Um ) Rab4 shows 65 % identity to HsRab4 . Both proteins contain a specific C - terminal region . This region is absent from the closest yeast relative , Ypt31 , implied in secretion and vesicle traffic ( Jedd et al . , 1997 ) ( Figure 4 ) . Blast search with the Rab4 specific C - terminal region of U . maydis , retrieved only other Rab4 proteins indicating the specificity of this region ( Figure 5 ) . Using this approach , a Rab4 - like protein of Schizosaccharomyces pombe was identified that had less homology in the overall protein structure , which was the reason for negative results in 10 Results the earlier blast searches . However , the functional implication of the Rab4 - specific region remains to be elucidated . Table 1 .

The green marked amino acids resemble identical amino acids among the protein sequences . Based on these results it is very likely that endocytosis and associated recycling pathways exist in U . maydis . All identified components await further characterisation for a function in endocytosis of U . maydis . 2 . 1 . 1 The t - SNARE Yup1 colocalises with Rab4 and Rab5 In a previous study Yup1 was identified as an early endosomal t - SNARE protein required for functional endocytosis in Ustilago maydis ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) . However , this was solely based on the use of the endocytic marker dye FM4 - 64 ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) that colocalised with Yup1 - GFP on EE ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) . 13 Results In order to further strengthen this conclusion , three strains were generated that contained Yup1 , fused to a double tag of red fluorescent protein ( RFP 2 ) and a fusion of GFP with the previously identified early endosomal markers Rab4 or Rab5 ( see above ) respectively ( strains FB1G 3 Rab4Yup1R 2 , FB2GRab5aYup1R 2 and FB2GRab5b Yup1R 2 ) . In line with the previous observations , Yup1 and each Rab protein colocalised ( Fig . 6 and Fig . 7 ) . For Rab5a and Rab5b comigration with Yup1 was observed on small moving dots ( Rab5a : 94 . 8 % , n = 94 Yup1 - carrying endosomes , Fig . 6A lower panel ; Rab5b : 82 . 3 % , n = 96 Yup1 - carrying endosomes ) but not on vacuoles ( Fig . 6A , arrow ) . Colocalisation of Yup1 and Rab4 was also observed on the vacuole ( data not shown ) . As these GTPases are characteristic for EE these results add strong support to our conclusion that Yup1 acts on EE in U . maydis . The additional role of Rab4 on vacuoles cannot yet be explained and needs further elucidation . Figure 6 . Colocalisation of Yup1 with Rab5a and Rab5b .

Arrow indicates significant colocalisation . Bar : 2 µm ( Figure in cooperation with G . Steinberg ) 2 . 1 . 2 Yup1 has a function on early endosomes and vacuoles In the course of the extended analysis of Yup1 on EE also an additional functional characterisation was attempted . It had been noted previously that Yup1 and the vacuolar t - SNARE Vam7p from S . cerevisiae ( Wada and Anraku , 1992 ) share significant sequence similarity and a PX domain ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) . Furthermore , Yup1 also localises to the vacuolar tonoplast , which suggests a similar vacuolar function as for Vam7 . To first exclude the possibility that the localisation on the tonoplast ( Fig 6A , arrow ) is due to an overexpression artefact of the ectopically integrated Yup1 - GFP or – RFP fusion construct ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) I constructed a strain which expressed the endogenous Yup1 protein fused to a double RFP tag ( strain FB1Yup1R 2 ) . However a similar localization pattern on EE and the vacuole was obtained with the endogenous construct ( not shown ) . To check whether Yup1 can substitute for Vam7p in homeotypic vacuolar fusion in S . cerevisiae ( Wada and Anraku , 1992 ) , I transformed the vam7 ∆ strain with a CEN6 - plasmid containing the Yup1 gene under control of the ura3 promoter . The resulting mutant grew slightly better ( Fig . 8A ; # 3 ) compared to vam7 ∆ strain carrying the empty vector ( Fig . 8A ; # 2 ) , but was still reduced in growth compared to wild type transformed with empty vector ( Fig . 8A , # 1 ) . Pulse chase experiments using FM4 - 64 in vam7 ∆ mutants and vam7 ∆ cells expressing yup1 ( Fig . 8B , " ∆ vam7 " and " ∆ vam7 + yup1 " ) demonstrated that Yup1 is also able to partially rescue the defect in vacuole 15 Results fragmentation ( Fig . 8B “ vam7 ∆ ” ) , which is typical for vam7 ∆ mutants ( Wada and Anraku , 1992 ) . In contrast , the yup1 ts - phenotype that results in inhibition of growth at 34°C ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) could not be rescued by expression of Vam7 ( Fig . 8A ; # 4 : wild type control with empty vector ; # 5 : yup1 ts with empty vector ; # 6 : yup1 ts + VAM7 ; for details see Materials and Methods ) . Taken together , the t - SNARE Yup1 functions on EE as was confirmed by colocalisation with the EE - markers Rab4 and Rab5 . Yup1 can complement for ScVam7 indicating additional functions in the course of the endocytic pathway . Figure 8 .

Bar : 3 µm . 2 . 2 The role of endocytosis for U . maydis pathogenic development After confirming the association of Yup1 with EE I used the temperature sensitive yup1 mutant ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) in order to determine the importance of endocytosis for pathogenicity . I infected 6 day old maize plants with a mixture of control strains FB1 and FB2 , as well as the temperature sensitive endocytosis mutant strains FB1Yup1 ts and FB2Yup1 ts . Infected plants were incubated at both permissive temperature ( 22°C ) and restrictive temperature ( 34°C ) , and tumor formation was monitored 14 days post infection . At 22°C infection symptoms were found at similar 16 Results rates in both wild - type and mutant infected plants ( Fig . 9A , “control” , 22°C ; ”yup1 ts , 22°C” ; Fig . 9B ) . However , at restrictive conditions ( 34°C ) yup1 ts mutant cells failed to induce symptoms , whereas almost normal infection was observed for plants infected with control strains ( Fig . 9A , “control , 34°C” ; “yup1 ts , 34°C” ; Fig . 9B ) . Plant infection requires the formation of dikaryotic filaments , which can be monitored on charcoal containing agar plates . To further analyse the impaired virulence of yup1 ts strains , I performed these mating assays using strains FB1Yup1 ts and FB2Yup1 ts , as well as compatible control strains . At permissive temperatures both compatible control and yup1 ts cells fused to form a " fuzzy " and white colony consisting of dikaryotic filaments ( Fig . 9C , upper panel ) . In contrast , at 34°C only the control cells formed fuzzy colonies , while yup1 ts mutants were unable to form dikaryotic hyphae ( Fig . 9C , lower panel ) , suggesting that EE are required early in the infection process . However , a cross of a wild - type strain and a yup1 ts mutant strain was dominated by the wild - type phenotype and resulted in fuzzy filaments . Figure 9 .

( C ) Cross of control strains FB1 x FB2 and yup1 ts mutant strains FB1Yup1 ts x FB2Yup1 ts on charcoal - containing agar plates at 22°C and 34°C . 17 Results 2 . 2 . 1 Pheromone perception is defective in yup1 ts mutants As a prerequisite of mating , compatible cells have to recognize the mating partner pheromone , which triggers a signal cascade and finally leads to increased expression of their own pheromone and the formation of conjugation hyphae ( Urban et al . , 1996b ) . Our mating assays on yup1 ts mutants suggested that early endosome function is essential for the formation of dikaryotic filaments . Therefore , I tested whether growth of conjugation tubes is also mediated by this process . I mimicked the presence of a mating partner by the addition of synthetic pheromone ( Spellig et al . , 1994 ) . After about 6 hours of incubation with synthetic pheromone at 22°C both wild - type and mutant cells had formed long conjugation filaments to similar extents ( Fig . 10B ) . In the presence of pheromone conjugation hyphae were also formed in wild - type strains at 34°C ( Fig . 10A , control , pheromone ; 10B , control ) . However , pheromone did not induce the formation of conjugation hyphae in yup1 ts mutants at 34°C ( Fig . 10A , 10B ; pheromone , yup1 ts ) . Instead , mutant cells were thickened and showed the previously described abnormal morphology ( Fig . 10A yup1 ts , phermone ; Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) . This raised the possibility that the absence of mating hyphae in yup1 ts mutants is due to a morphological defect . Figure 10 . Formation of conjugation hyphae ( A ) Filamentous growth and formation of conjugation hyphae was induced in strain FB1 and in FB1Yup1 ts at 34°C for at least 6 hours . DMSO was used as solvent control . Pheromone perception was visualized using the mfa1 Promoter – GFP fusion construct as a reporter at 34°C . Both conjugation hyphae formation ( B ) and pheromone perception ( C ) were quantified at 22°C and 34°C . Bars : 5 µm 18 Results Alternatively , it was considered possible that the impaired formation of conjugation hyphae is a consequence of defects in pheromone sensing . Thus , I made use of a strain that expressed GFP under the control of the promoter of the mating pheromone gene ( mfa1 ; strains FB1mG ) . In this strain , addition of external pheromone or the presence of a mating partner induces the expression of GFP , which is visible about two hours after pheromone addition ( Spellig et al . , 1996 ) . Wild - type and yup1 ts mutant cells ( strain FB1Yup1 ts mG ) were able to perceive supplemented pheromone , as indicated by the cytoplasmic GFP signal at permissive temperature ( Fig . 10C ) . A similar situation was found in wild - type cells at 34°C ( Fig . 10A , Pro mfa1 : GFP , control ; Fig . 10C ) . In contrast , mutant cells did not express GFP at 34°C ( Fig . 10A , Pro mfa1 : GFP , Yup1 ts ; Fig . 10C ) . Thus , it is most likely that early endosome function is required for pheromone perception and , consequently , for conjugation hyphae formation . 2 . 2 . 2 The pheromone receptor Pra1 is internalized via early endosomes Pheromone perception in U . maydis wild - type strain FB1 requires the activity of the G - protein coupled pheromone receptor Pra1 ( Bölker et al . , 1992 ) , which is predicted ( see Materials and Methods ) to contain seven transmembrane segments and shares an overall similarity of 45 % with Ste3 , one of the two pheromone receptors of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Ste3 contains a signal sequence for constitutive endocytosis and ligand induced endocytosis ( Chen and Davis , 2000 ) that is not present in Pra1 . Nevertheless , it was considered that impaired endocytosis of Pra1 via Yup1 - tagged endosomes is responsible for the reduced pheromone sensing of the yup1 ts mutant . Therefore , the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) was fused to the C - terminus of the endogenous copy of Pra1 and observed its cellular distribution in strain FB1Pra1G . In non - stimulated yeast - like cells the receptor is only weakly expressed ( Urban et al . , 1996a ) and consequently only faint signals of the Pra1 - GFP fusion protein were observed in the plasma membrane ( Fig . 11A1 , inset ) , while most Pra1 - GFP localised in the vacuoles ( Fig . 11A1 ) , where the receptor is most likely degraded . 19 Results Figure 11 . Localisation and constitutive endocytosis of Pra1 - GFP in haploid sporidia . ( A ) The strain FB1PraG was treated with 10 µM of the actin inhibitor Latrunculin A ( A2 ) or with the solvent DMSO ( A1 ) for 45 min before washout of LatA ( A3 ) . Insets highlight amounts of Pra1 - GFP in the membrane . Bar : 3 µm . ( B ) Line scan analysis of Pra1 - GFP signal intensities . Scanning lines are indicated in A . ( Figure in cooperation with G . Steinberg ) . However , disruption of F - actin by the inhibitor Latrunculin A enriched Pra1 - GFP in the plasma membrane ( Fig . 11A2 , inset ; Fig . 12A ) , and after washing - out the drug , the receptor disappeared from the cell surface ( Fig . 11A3 , inset ; Fig . 12A ) . The increase in Pra1 - GFP content in the plasma membrane is best illustrated by linescan analysis of the intensities of Pra1 - GFP in the mother cell ( Fig . 11B ; scanning lines are indicated in Fig . 11A1 - 3 ) . While only faint signals are detected in DMSO - treated control cells ( Fig . 11B , red line ) , LatA treatment drastically increased the signal in the plasma membrane at the edge of the cell ( Fig . 11B , blue lines , arrows ) , which decreased after removal of the drug ( Fig . 11B , green line ) . Disruption of actin is known to inhibit the endocytic removal of receptors from the cell surface ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) , suggesting that the rise in Pra1 - GFP after disruption of microfilaments is due to a defect in endocytic internalisation . After washing out LatA the excess of Pra1 is partially removed within the observation time . These results indicate that Pra1 is constitutively endocytosed in yeast - like cells of U . maydis in the absence of mating pheromone . Figure 12 . Signal intensities of Pra1 - GFP at the plasma membrane after disruption of the actin cytoskeleton . ( A ) Quantitative analysis of the intensity of Pra1 - GFP in the tip of conjugation hyphae of strain FB1Pra1G in the presence / absence of LatA . ( B ) Analysis of Pra1 - GFP signal intensities at the tip of conjugation hyphae at different time points after treatment with LatA . 20 Results After addition of pheromone , cells of strain FB1Pra1G formed conjugation hyphae ( Fig . 13A , " DIC " ) , indicating that the Pra1 - GFP fusion protein was fully functional . In these conjugation hyphae , Pra1 - GFP localised to the plasma membrane in a cap - like fashion at the growing hyphal apex ( Fig . 13 ; " Pra1 - GFP " , arrow head and right inset in merged image ) . In addition , Pra1 - GFP accumulated in vacuoles that were stained with the vacuolar dye Celltracker TM Blue ( Fig . 13 ; arrows and left inset in merged image ) . Figure 13 . Localisation of Pra1 - GFP in conjugation hyphae . Incubation of yeast - like cells of strain FB1PraG with synthetic pheromone for 3 h induced the formation of conjugation hyphae ( DIC ) . Pra1 - GFP ( green ) localised to the tip of the hyphae ( arrow head ) where it forms an apical cap ( overlay , right inset ) . In addition , Pra1 - GFP localised in subapical organelles ( Pra1 - GFP , arrows ) that co - stained with Celltracker blue ( red ; celltracker ) , indicating that they were vacuoles ( overlay , left inset ; colocalisation results in yellow ) . Bar : 5 µm . Similar to yeast - like cells , disruption of F - actin in conjugation hyphae by 10µM LatA for up to 150 min led to a significant increase of Pra1 - GFP in the plasma membrane at the tip region ( Fig . 12B ) , indicating that internalisation of Pra1 is actin - dependent in conjugation hyphae as well , whereas the delivery of new receptor does not require the actin cytoskeleton . To further elucidate the role of the pheromone receptor Pra1 I investigated the role of Pra1 beyond the initial pheromone stimulus . Cells expressing Pra1 - GFP from the endogenous locus ( FB1Pra1G ) were pheromone treated for 3h and characteristic Pra1 - GFP localisation was observed ( Fig . 14A compare to Fig . 13 ) . One set of cells 21 Results was further incubated with pheromone ( Fig . 14B1 ) while in a second set of cells the compatible pheromone was washed out ( Fig . 14C ) before further incubation overnight . In the absence of pheromone cells reverted to the haploid growth form ( Fig . 14C “ - a2 ON” ) . Interestingly , an intense Pra1 - GFP signal was still present in the plasma membrane of reverted haploid cells of FB1Pra1G , which can presently not be explained ( 98 % cells are haploid , n = 2 experiments , > 90 cells each ) . Control cells that received a continuous pheromone treatment at the same time grew filamentous ( Fig . 14B1 ; 92 . 91 % cells filamentous n = 2 experiments , > 90 cells each ) and Pra1 - GFP still characteristically concentrated at the tip of the conjugation hyphae ( Fig . 14B2 ) . This indicates that a continuous pheromone stimulus is required for growth of conjugation hyphae and that Pra1 is continuously exposed at the hyphal tip during growth of conjugation hyphae . Figure 14 . Long - term pheromone treatment of U . maydis . Cells of FB1Pra1G were incubated with synthetic pheromone for 3 h to initiate pheromone perception and growth of conjugation hyphae . Subsequently pheromone was washed out ( C ) or cells were further incubated with pheromone ( B1 + B2 ) over night .

Bars : A , C = 5 µm ; B1 = 10 µm , B2 = 2 µm . 22 Results 2 . 2 . 3 Endocytic recycling of Pra1 is impaired in the yup1 ts mutant I next asked whether endocytosis of Pra1 - GFP involves the Yup1 - carrying EE . In order to gain support for this idea I constructed a strain expressing both Pra1 - GFP and Yup1 - RFP 2 ( FB1Pra1GYup1R 2 ) . After pheromone stimulation Pra1 - GFP colocalised with Yup1RFP 2 and rapidly moved on EE ( Fig . 15 ) . The cap - like structure of Pra1 - GFP at the hyphal tip was not involved in colocalisation . Figure 15 . Colocalisation and Comigration of Yup1 - RFP and Pra1 - GFP . Time - lapse series of Yup1RFP 2 ( red ) and Pra1GFP ( green ) . Colocalisation is shown in yellow in the merged images . Arrows indicate moving EE . Time is given in seconds . Bar : 1 µm . ( Image in cooperation with G . Steinberg ) To obtain further evidence for a role of EE in Pra1 - GFP processing , control cells and yup1 ts mutants were stimulated with pheromone under permissive conditions for 2 h to initiate pheromone perception and subsequently were shifted to restrictive temperature for additional 2 h . While this treatment had no effect on the Pra1 - GFP distribution of control hyphae ( Fig 16A “control” ) , Pra1 - GFP accumulated in yup1 ts mutant hyphae in small immobile dots within the cytoplasm ( Fig . 16A , “yup1 ts ” , arrows ) , with most Pra1 - GFP found in the hyphal tip ( Fig . 16A , “yup1 ts ” , arrowhead ) . 23 Results Figure 16 . Localisation of Pra1 - GFP in the yup1 ts mutant background . ( A ) Localisation of Pra1 - GFP in Strain FB1Yup1 ts Pra1G and the control strain FB1Pra1G that were stimulated with pheromone for 2 h at 22°C before shift to 34°C for 2 h .

( C ) Double labelling experiments in yup1 ts mutants demonstrate that Pra1 - GFP ( green ) and endocytic membranes , stained with FM 4 - 64 ( red ) colocalised in the apical cytoplasm in yup1 ts cells . ( D ) Pra1 - GFP containing vesicles obtained from the protein extracts of pheromone stimulated and shifted control strain and FB1Yup1 ts Pra1G at 34°C . The merged image shows vesicles isolated from FB1Yup1 ts Pra1G at 34°C simultaneously incubated with FM 4 - 64 . B - D Bars : 1 µm . In yup1 ts mutants , Pra1 - GFP no longer colocalised with vacuoles that were stained with CellTracker TM Blue ( Fig . 9B “yup1 ts ” compare to “control” ) , but accumulated in small aggregates that might represent clusters of primary endocytic vesicles at 34°C . Consistently , the apical Pra1 - GFP cluster colocalised with the endocytic marker dye FM 4 - 64 that had been coincubated with the cells ( Fig . 16C ) , suggesting that Pra1 - GFP is internalised in yup1 ts mutant hyphae , but accumulates in small primary endocytic vesicles within the cytoplasm . This notion is supported by the fact that whole cell extracts of strain FB1Yup1 ts Pra1G contained numerous small Pra1 - GFP carrying vesicles ( Fig . 16D ) , which were mainly colocalising with FM4 - 64 ( Fig , 9D , lower panel ; colocalisation results in yellow ) . These vesicles were much less abundant in extracts of strain FB1PraG that had been treated in similar ways ( Fig . 16D “control” ) , again indicating that primary endocytic vesicles accumulate in yup1 ts mutants due to the fusion defect at early endosomes . However it is important to note that these cell extracts also contain vesicles that carried either Pra1 - GFP or were only stained with FM4 - 64 ( Fig . 16D arrows ) . While the Pra1 - GFP stained vesicles could be secretory 24 Results vesicles , the existence of endocytic transport vesicles that do not contain the pheromone - receptor argues for additional endocytic pathways for the uptake of the endocytic marker dye FM 4 - 64 . In order to get a more detailed insight into the defects of yup1 ts mutants I investigated the spatial relation between the plasma membrane and Pra1 - GFP signals in the hyphal apex . Therefore , I simultaneously added FM4 - 64 and 0 . 5 % formaldehyde to wild - type and yup1 ts conjugation hyphae that had been incubated at 34°C . This allowed the dye to incorporate into the plasma membrane but blocked further internalisation , while the GFP - tagged receptor was still detectable . Figure 17 . Analysis of Pra1 - GFP localisation in the hyphal tip . Analysis of localisation of Pra1 - GFP ( green ) in respect to the plasma membrane ( red ) in control cells and yup1 ts mutant hyphae after incubation for 2h at 34°C . A line scan of the intensities demonstrates that FM4 - 64 and Pra1 - GFP colocalised at the edges of the cell ( A2 , arrows ; scanning line indicated in A1 , overlay ) . In yup1 ts cells Pra1 - GFP was depleted from the plasma membrane and accumulated within the cytoplasm in the hyphal tip ( E3 , E4 ) . Bars : 1 µm . In control cells Pra1 - GFP colocalised with FM4 - 64 in the plasma membrane at the hyphal apex ( Fig . 17A1 ) , which is nicely illustrated by linescan analysis of the signal intensities of Pra1 - GFP and FM - 4 - 64 ( Fig . 17A2 ; scanning line indicated in A1 ) . In contrast , in yup1 ts mutants Pra1 - GFP was depleted from the plasma membrane , but accumulated in the apical cytoplasm ( Fig . 17A3 , A4 ) . Immuno - gold labeling of Pra1 - GFP , done by G . Hause ( University of Halle ) , confirmed that the receptor located in the cell periphery in control hyphae at 34°C as was detected using anti - GFP antibodies 25 Results ( Fig . 18A , arrows ) . The majority of receptor molecules in the yup1 ts mutant hyphae was found within the cytoplasm ( Fig . 18B , arrows ) . Figure 18 .

Arrows indicated localisation of Pra1 - GFP , insets give details of localisation pattern . Bars : 0 . 5 µm . Immunogoldlabelling and EM were done by Dr . Gerd Hause , University of Halle , Germany . 2 . 2 . 4 Recycling of the pheromone receptor The results described so far indicated that the uptake of Pra1 - GFP into EE is required to maintain enough active receptor in the plasma membrane , suggesting that the receptor is recycled to the surface for additional rounds of pheromone binding . I next attempted to gain more direct evidence for Pra1 recycling in conjugation hyphae of U . maydis . In a first set of control experiments , I confirmed that 100 µg / ml cycloheximide for 45 min fully inhibit protein biosynthesis in Ustilago maydis ( Fig . 19 ) . Therefore I used cells of strain FB2rGTub1 that contain an additional copy of GFP - α tubulin that is expressed under the control of the crg - promoter which is blocked in glucose - containing medium ( Bottin et al . , 1996 ) . Consequently , no GFP - labeled microtubules were visible ( Fig . 19A1 ) . Shifting these cells for 120 min to arabinose - containing medium induced the expression of GFP - α tubulin and MTs became visible ( Fig . 19A2 , " Ara " ) . In contrast , no GFP - α tubulin was detected after 120 min growth in arabinose - containing medium when supplemented with 100 µg / ml cycloheximide for the last 45 min ( Fig . 19A3 ; " Ara + cyclo " ) . This strongly indicated that 45 min of 100 µg / ml cycloheximide treatment completely abolished protein synthesis , including that of GFP - α tubulin in U . maydis . 26 Results Figure 19 . Cycloheximide treatment in U . maydis . In control experiments the effect of cycloheximide on protein synthesis was investigated using strain FB2rGTub1 that contains an additional copy of α - tubulin fused to GFP ( GFP - Tub1 , ( Steinberg et al . , 2001 ) under the control of the inducible crg - promoter . In this strain no GFP - labelled microtubules were detected in glucose - containing medium ( A1 ) , but expression of GFP - Tub1 was induced after shift to arabinose - containing medium for at least 2 h ( A2 ) . When FB2rGTub1 was grown in arabinose - containing medium for 75 min and cycloheximide was added for additional 45 min protein biosynthesis was blocked and GFP - α tubulin was not synthesized . Bar : 2 µm . Next , I incubated conjugation hyphae of strain FB1Pra1G with or without cycloheximide for 45 min . The block of protein synthesis led to a drastic decrease in Pra1 - GFP signal intensity in the plasma membrane ( Fig . 20A " control " and " + cyclo " ; Fig . 20B ) , which demonstrates that synthesis and secretion of new receptor was the major source for the exposed receptor . When this treatment was followed by additional 120 min incubation in DMSO / cycloheximide the amount of Pra1 - GFP further decreased and intensively stained vacuoles appeared ( Fig . 20A " DMSO + cyclo " ; Fig 20B , ) . In contrast , 120 min of cycloheximide treatment in combination with LatA led to a significant increase of Pra1 - GFP in the plasma membrane ( Fig . 20A " LatA + cyclo " ; Fig . 20B ; P = 0 . 0001 ) . This increase , under our artificial conditions where synthesis of new receptor and initial endocytic uptake is blocked , indicates that a significant amount of Pra1 - GFP is stored in the endocytic pathway and recycles back to the plasma membrane and EE . 27 Results Figure 20 . Quantitative analysis of Pra1 - GFP recycling . ( A ) Pra1 - GFP signals in the tip of conjugation hyphae . Cells were treated with water ( control ) or cycloheximide ( + cyclo ) for 45 min .

Bar : 1 µm . 2 . 2 . 5 Constitutive expression of Pra1 restores pheromone perception Our results indicated that yup1 ts mutants are defective in receptor recycling and that the pheromone receptor accumulates in the cytoplasm , which decreases the amount of exposed Pra1 on the cell surface . To test whether reduced amounts of Pra1 - GFP are indeed responsible for the perception defects in yup1 ts mutants , I increased the amount of receptor by expression of Pra1 - GFP under the control of the strong otef - promoter ( strain FB1Yup1 ts oPraG ) . Western analysis confirmed that receptor protein levels were ~ 10 - fold increased in the mutant strain at both 22°C and 34°C ( Fig . 21A ) , and most Pra1 - GFP was concentrated in the plasma membrane ( Fig . 21B , " oPra1G " , inset ) , whereas Pra1 - GFP was almost invisible in the control strain FB1Yup1 ts Pra1G at 22°C ( Fig . 21B , “control” ) . 28 Results Figure 21 . Complementation of yup1 ts mutants with constitutively expressed Pra1 - GFP . ( A ) Western blot showing levels of Pra1GFP in cell extracts of the yup1 ts mutant background at native levels and Pra1 - GFP expressed under the control of the constitutive otef - promotor . ( B ) Localization of Pra1 - GFP in yup1 ts ( FB1Yup1 ts PraG ) and with additional expression of Pra1GFP under the constitutive otef - promotor ( FB1Yup1 ts oPra1GFP ) at 22°C . High expression of Pra1 - GFP increased the amount of receptor in the plasma membrane ( inset ) . Bar : 2 µm . In order to monitor the ability to perceive pheromone , I next integrated the red fluorescent protein under the control of the mfa1 - promoter into this mutant . After 2 h at 34°C this strain ( FB1Yup1 ts mRoPraG ) showed a morphology defect ( Fig . 22A , " DMSO " ) that was characteristic of mutants impaired in early endosome function ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) . Under these conditions Pra1 - GFP clustered in cytoplasmic accumulation near the growth region ( Fig . 22A , " Pra1 - GFP " , inset ) that were reminiscent of the cytoplasmic Pra1 - GFP cluster in yup1 ts conjugation hyphae ( see Fig . 16A ) . In addition , Pra1 - GFP was still localised to the plasma membrane , indicating that endocytosis is not able to remove the high excess of constitutively expressed Pra1 - GFP from the surface ( Fig , 22A ; " Pra1 - GFP " , inset ) . Consistent with the notion , that a lack of receptor is responsible for the defect in pheromone perception , treatment with synthetic pheromone now induced expression of red fluorescent protein ( Fig . 22C , " pheromone " , 22B , " yup1 ts oPra1G " ) . In contrast , but consistently with the results described above , pheromone treatment induced RFP expression only in a very minor fraction of mutant cells when Pra1 - GFP was expressed under its native pra1 - promoter in the yup1 ts background ( Fig . 22B , " yup1 ts " ; strain FB1Yup1 ts mRPraG ) . 29 Results Figure 22 . Pheromone treatment in complemented yup1 ts mutants . ( A ) Strain FB1Yup1 ts mRoPraG was grown at 34°C and stimulated with synthetic pheromone or DMSO as control . Bar : 10 µm . ( B ) Quantification of the response to synthetic pheromone of control and yup1 ts cells treated with synthetic pheromone or synthetic pheromone and LatA . Bars represent the percentage of cells that show mfa - promoter induced RFP expression . These results demonstrate that high levels of the pheromone receptor restore the defect in pheromone perception . Finally , we tested whether the initial steps of endocytosis of Pra1 - GFP are required for pheromone perception . Therefore we disrupted F - actin in strain FB1mG with 10 µM LatA for 45 min and added synthetic pheromone / LatA to these cells . In these cells the pheromone induced the mfa1 - promoter , as indicated by GFP expression ( Fig . 22B , " LatA " ) confirming similar results of S . cerevisiae ( Rohrer et al . , 1993 ) . This suggests that the initial steps of receptor internalisation are not needed for detection of the mating partner . Taken together these results strongly support the notion that recycling via EE is required to maintain steady state levels of the receptor at the cellular surface during the initial step of pheromone perception . 2 . 2 . 6 Endocytosis is essential for cell - cell fusion Restored pheromone perception in FB1yup1 ts oPra1 ( Fig . 23A ; " yup1 ts " ) led to the formation of short and irregular conjugation hyphae in the presence of synthetic pheromone ( Fig . 23A ; compare to strain FB1oPra1 , " control " ) . I next asked whether these conjugation hyphae are able to orient themselves in a gradient of pheromone and mediate cell - cell fusion . Therefore , I spotted compatible strains that expressed 30 Results cytoplasmic GFP or RFP across from each other on water agar slides at 34°C . In these confrontation assays , control cells ( strains FB1oPra1 _ G and FB2oPra2 _ R ) formed long filaments that grew towards the partner and fused , which resulted in a faint yellow colour in the merged image due to the mix of the cytoplasmic GFP and RFP ( Fig . 23B , " control " , arrow indicating the site of fusion ; asterisk marks nuclei ) . Figure 23 . Mating and fusion ability of the yup1 ts mutant constitutively expressing Pra1 .

( B ) Confrontation assay of mating partners expressing otef Pra as well as cytoplasmic GFP or RFP . Asterisks in the control indicate the nuclei in the haploid conjugation hyphae . Their fusion site to form the dikaryotic filament is marked by the arrow . Fused hyphae express both GFP and RFP resulting in yellow . yup1 ts cells did not fuse ( inset ) . Bars : 10 µm . Cells of the compatible yup1 ts mutants ( FB1Yup1 ts oPra1 _ G and FB2Yup1 ts oPra2 _ R ) grew towards the mating partner ( Fig . 23B , " yup1 ts " ; inset ) , but were unable to bridge large distances ( not shown ) . However , under these conditions , no cell - cell fusion was detected in the yup1 ts mutants , suggesting that endocytosis might be required during this step . In agreement with this , a mixture of these compatible yup1 ts mutants did not form a " fuzzy " white colony and only rarely yellow dikaryotic cells were found at 34°C ( Fig . 24A , " yup1 ts " ; top right inset shows colony appearance , fusion ) . This was in striking contrast to control experiments ( Fig . 24 , " control " ) . Cell - cell fusion did not increase in yup1 ts cells even after 3 . 5 days at 34°C ( Fig . 24A , " yup1 ts " ; lower right 31 Results inset ) , indicating that endocytosis is essential for cell - cell fusion during early pathogenic development . Figure 24 . Assay for fusion of GFP or RFP labelled mating partners on charcoal plates . Fused hyphae express both RFP and GFP resulting in a yellow colour after spotting a mixture of compatible cells on charcoal plates ( strains FB1oPra1 _ G and FB2oPra2 _ R as a control and FB1Yup1 ts oPra1 _ G and FB2Yup1 ts oPra2 _ R ) .

( B ) Quantification of tumor formation after plant infection with FB1oPra1 x FB2oPra2 as control and the compatible mutants FB1Yup1 ts oPra1 x FB2Yup1 ts oPra2 for 14 days at 34°C . Consequently , in plant infection assays , using the strains that constitutively express Pra1 / Pra2 , no symptoms were seen after infection with compatible yup1 ts cells at 34°C ( Fig . 24B ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that endocytosis is essential for mating in U . maydis . 2 . 2 . 7 Plant colonization is only slightly effected in yup1 ts cells Next I analysed the importance of endocytosis in later stages of pathogenic development . I inoculated plants with compatible wild type strains ( FB1 and FB2 ) and yup1 ts mutants ( FB1Yup1 ts and FB2Yup1 ts ) at permissive temperature and allowed them to complete the mating reaction , before shifting them to higher temperature ( see Material and Methods ) . Under these conditions , yup1 ts mutants formed thicker and more irregularly shaped hyphae ( Fig . 25A ; cell wall stained with calcofluor white ; compare " yup1 ts " to " control " ) , which were nevertheless able to form appressoria ( Fig . 25A , insets ) and entered the plant at restrictive temperature ( Fig . 25B ) . Further time 32 Results course experiments covering the first 7 days did not reveal any significant differences between control hyphae and yup1 ts mutant hyphae inside the plant tissue ( Fig . 25B ) , although yup1 ts cells appeared slightly thicker and were sometimes slower in colonization of the host . Consequently , yup1 ts infected plants that were incubated for 3 days at 22°C before shift to restrictive temperature showed tumor formation , albeit at reduced rates ( Fig . 25C ) . Interestingly , tumors in these yup1 ts mutant infected plants were only observed at the stem and not in higher parts of the plant ( not shown ) . However , these tumors did not contain any teliospores even after 19 days post infection ( Fig . 25D ; Fig . 25E ) , although fungal material was detected in the tumors of plants infected with yup1 ts mutant strains ( Fig . 25E ; compare to " control " ) . In summary this indicates that endocytosis is less important for growth within the plant but is essential for the formation of teliospores . 33 Results Figure 25 .

In contrast yup1 ts tumors are devoid of teliospores in the center as well as at the edge of the tumor ( yup1 ts ) . Bar : 1 cm . ( E ) Higher magnification of tumor tissue confirmed the presence of teliospores in wild - type tumors ( control ) while teliospores were absent in yup1 ts tumors and only hyphal fragments were visible ( yup1 ts ) . Bar : 10 µm . 34 Results 2 . 2 . 8 Teliospore germination is mediated by Yup1 Finally , I investigated the ability of yup1 ts mutants to germinate from teliospores generated at 22°C . Both wildtype and yup1 ts teliospores germinated after ~ 24h at 22°C on CM - G containing agar layers ( Fig . 26A , 22°C and Fig . 26B ) . However germination rates of yup1 ts teliospores were greatly reduced at 34°C ( Fig . 26A , 34°C , compare " yup1 ts " and " control " ; 26C ) and only slowly increased after prolonged incubation for 3 days ( Fig . 26A , 34°C , " yup1 ts + " ) . In those cases where yup1 ts teliospores managed to germinate , the promycelium showed morphological alterations compared to wild type ( Fig . 26D ) . Thus , Yup1 - mediated endocytosis participates in teliospore germination and functional impairment of endocytosis leads to a reduced germination rate . Figure 26 . Teliospore germination . Quantification of teliospore germination at permissive temperature 22°C and restrictive temperature 34°C for control and yup1 ts spores .

The results obtained so far indicate that surface proteins , such as the pheromone receptor Pra1 cycle between the plasma membrane and EE . It is known from the yeast S . cereviaiae that chitin synthases , which participate in wall formation , undergo endocytic recycling ( Ziman et al . , 1996 ) . Ustilago maydis has eight chitin synthases that have different functions during development and pathogenic development of the fungus ( Weber et al . , 2006 ) . One of them , the myosin chitin synthase 1 ( Mcs1 ) , is only required for pathogenicity ( Weber et al . , 2006 ) . Previous results had indicated that Mcs1 locates to the active growth region ( Weber et al . , 2006 ) and is transported in a bi - directional fashion within the cell before it is degraded in the vacuole . This was the reason to anticipate that this chitin synthase must also be endocytosed . To test this hypothesis Mcs1 was first localised tagging the protein with triple GFP at its N - terminus under control of the constitutive otef - Promoter ( Spellig et al . , 1996 ) . In haploid sporidia GFP 3 - Mcs1 localised to the newly emerging bud and was found in small particles and in the vacuole ( Fig . 27A ) . Localisation at the growing bud was confirmed by a staining the newly synthesized chitin with wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) ( Robin et al . , 1986 ) . Figure 27 . Localisation of Mcs1 . ( A ) GFP 3 - Mcs1 localises to the new emerging bud ( 1 ) is seen in small particles ( 2 ) and is found in the vacuole ( 3 ) . Localisation of Mcs1 ( green ) at the growing bud is confirmed by wheat - germ agglutinin staining ( WGA , red ) which results in a yellow colour in the overlay . ( B ) GFP 3 - Mcs1 ( green ) is part of the endosomal pathway as is determined by colocalisation with the early endosomal marker Yup1 - RFP ( red ) . Colocalisation of both proteins results in a yellow colour in the overlay . Bar : 2 µm . 36 Results The GFP 3 - Mcs1 fusion protein colocalised with RFP tagged - Yup1 in a strain that simultaneously expressed both proteins ( FB1oGMcs1oYup1R ) resulting in a yellow colour in the image overlay ( Fig . 27B , overlay ) . In addition , GFP 3 - Mcs1 co - localised with the endocytic marker dye FM4 - 64 ( not shown ) . Therefore I next asked whether Mcs1 is endocytosed and whether endocytosis takes place in a yup1 - dependent fashion . In analogy to the studies with Pra1 , I blocked the initial steps of endocytosis ( Kubler and Riezman , 1993 ) by inhibition of actin polymerisation with LatA . In the control cells GFP 3 - Mcs1 localised to the tips of newly forming buds and was found in the vacuole ( Fig . 28A + B , “ + DMSO” ) . In contrast GFP 3 - Mcs1 accumulated at the whole cell periphery of the Lat A treated cells ( Figure 28A + B , ” + LatA” ) . The effect was reversible once Lat A was washed out ( Fig . 28A + B , ” - LatA” ) . This indicates that GFP 3 - Mcs1 is constitutively endocytosed in U . maydis . Figure 28 . Block of GFP 3 - Mcs1 endocytosis . ( A + B ) Endocytosis of GFP 3 - Mcs1 was blocked by LatA treatment for 2 h . Control cells were treated with DMSO . ( B ) Corresponding quantification of GFP 3 - Mcs1 signals in ( A ) at three different points at the cell peripherie ( excluding the normal localization sites at the bud peripherie ) . Bar : 2 µm . To determine whether endocytosis of Mcs1 is a yup1 - mediated process , I expressed GFP 3 – Mcs1 in a temperature sensitive Yup1 mutant ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) . ( strain FB1yup1 ts oGFP 3 - Mcs1 ) After incubation at restrictive conditions ( 6 h , 34°C ) control cells showed a clear vacuolar localisation of GFP3 - Mcs1 , which was confirmed using the vacuolar stain CellTracker TM Blue CMCA ( false coloured in red ) ( Figure 29A , yellow colour in overlay ) . In contrast the GFP 3 - Mcs1 signal could not be detected in the vacuole in yup1 ts cells that had also been incubated for 6 h at 34°C ( Figure 29B , no 37 Results signal in GFP , results in red vs . yellow in overlay A ) . In addition some mutant cells showed a strong GFP signal from accumulation of GFP 3 - Mcs1 at the bud tip in the cytoplasm ( Figure 29B , GFP , inset ) under restrictive conditions . Similarly to Pra1 accumulation in yup1 ts cells this could be the result from accumulation of putative primary endocytic vesicles that carry GFP 3 - Mcs1 . These results demonstrate that the primary internalisation of GFP 3 - Mcs1 is actin - dependent and that Yup1 mediates subsequent endocytosis steps in U . maydis . However , these results are preliminary and should be confirmed using a GFP - Mcs1 fusion protein expressed from the endogenous locus . Figure 29 . Distribution of GFP 3 - Mcs1 in yup1 ts mutant cells . ( A ) Control cells and ( B ) yup1 ts expressing GFP3 - Mcs1 ( green ) were incubated at 34°C for 6h . Both samples were stained with celltracker blue ( red ) to label the vacuoles . Endocytosis and degradation of GFP3 - Mcs1 in the vacuole results in a yellow colour in the overlay . Bars : 2 µm . 38 Discussion 3 Discussion 3 . 1 Endocytosis in U . maydis Endocytosis is a common process among eukaryotes with conserved mechanisms from yeast to animals ( Geli and Riezman , 1998 ) . It has long been controversial whether and to what extend endocytosis participates in growth and homeostasis of filamentous fungi ( Read and Kalkman , 2003 ) while it is believed that it occurs in other tip - growing cells like pollen tubes ( Camacho and Malho , 2003 ) and root hairs ( Ovecka et al . , 2005 ; Voigt et al . , 2005 ) . Growing evidence from different fungal species , including the one presented here in U . maydis , has changed this view and strongly indicates an essential role for endocytosis . Homologues of almost all commonly discussed components of the yeast endocytic machinery were identified by Blast analysis . Each of these yeast proteins had one or more significant homologues ( E ≤ 1e - 21 ) in the Ustilago genome . This is analogous to the findings of Read and Kalkman ( 2003 ) , who followed a similar Blast approach in N . crassa . The genome analysis strongly suggests that U . maydis possesses the complex endocytic protein machinery ( D ' Hondt et al . , 2000 ) required to conduct endocytosis . Nevertheless , it should be noted that proteins , such as actin , calmodulin and fimbrin do not exclusively participate in endocytosis but also perform other essential roles in the cell ( Davis et al . , 1986 ; Adams et al . , 1991 ; Ayscough et al . , 1997 ; Wu et al . , 2001 ) . The RabGTPases involved in early endosomal sorting ( summarized in Somsel Rodman and Wandinger - Ness , 2000 ) are also present in the U . maydis genome . Two homologues of Rab5 are encoded in the genome . This is comparable to S . cerevisiae , which also possesses multiple ( three ) Rab5 - like proteins with diverse functions ( Singer - Krüger et al . , 1994 ) while in mammalian systems one Rab5 protein , Rab5a , is known and two isoforms with 85 % homology , Rab5b and Rab5c , exist ( Chavrier et al . , 1992 ) . It will have to be elucidated whether the U . maydis Rab5s are functionally redundant , which could be assumed from their similar localisation patterns , or whether they operate differently . The two Rab5 proteins alone have not been colocalized yet . Knock - out mutants of both Rab5 proteins are currently under construction to elucidate 39 Discussion their functional role in U . maydis . In addition , a homologue of Rab4 could be identified which does not seem to be conserved among ascomycete fungi but can be found in basidiomycetes . Rab4 mediates endocytic recycling and has been associated with microtubule - dependent endosome transport and regulation of molecular motors ( Bielli et al . , 2001 ; Bananis et al . , 2003 ) . Microtubule - dependent endosomal transport has also been described for U . maydis ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2002 ) while it is not known in the ascomycete S . cerevisiae . The actual role of Rab4 in U . maydis will have to be elucidated . 3 . 2 The t - SNARE Yup1 Nevertheless , the presence of the whole endocytic machinery is not very surprising . It is in line since previous studies , using the temperature sensitive mutant of the endosomal t - SNARE Yup1 , already suggested a function for endocytosis in the maintenance of cell morphology and regulated membrane turnover in U . maydis ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) . These findings also identified Yup1 as an important player for endocytosis in U . maydis . Yup1 had been colocalised with the endocytic marker dye FM4 - 64 on bidirectionally moving EE ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) but molecular evidence for a function on EE was missing . The existence of the early endosome specific RabGTPases , Rab4 and Rab5 , in the Ustilago genome allowed a refined characterisation of the localisation for Yup1 . Colocalisation of Yup1 - RFP 2 and homologues of the early endosomal markers Rab4 ( van der Sluijs et al . , 1992 ) and Rab5 ( Bucci et al . , 1992 ; Pfeffer , 2001 ) suggested that it is indeed very likely that Yup1 functions as a t - SNARE on EE . However , it was obvious that in addition to colocalisation of the proteins , independent Rab - GFP signals were observed and Yup1 - RFP also localised to the vacuole . The vacuolar localisation of Yup1 - RFP is not an overexpression artefact but suggests for additional functions of Yup1 . This is further supported by the results of complementation assays in the yeast vam7 deletion mutant . Vam7 is a SNARE protein of S . cerevisiae ( Wada and Anraku , 1992 ; Ungermann and Wickner , 1998 ) that shares high homology with Yup1 . Similarly to Yup1 , Vam7 contains a t - SNARE - and a PX domain but functions in homeotypic vacuole fusion ( Wada and Anraku , 1992 ; Sato et al . , 1998 ) and fusion of vesicles with the vacuole ( Sato et al . , 1998 ) , whereas Yup1 acts on EE ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 and 40 Discussion above ) . Interestingly , substitution of vam7 ∆ with Yup1 complemented the vacuole fusion defect indicating that both proteins share a common task on vacuoles . This is particularly surprising since vacuoles appear normal in the yup1 ts mutant ( not shown ) . On the other hand , Vam7 could not substitute for Yup1 arguing for a greater functional competence of Yup1 , including a specific role on EE . It might also be possible that Yup1 additionally functions as a component of a second SNARE membrane complex mediating fusion of endocytic vesicles with the vacuole . 3 . 3 Yup1 - mediated endocytosis The localisation on EE and the predicted function as a t - SNARE ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) suggest that Yup1 acts during fusion of incoming vesicles with their target - the EE in U . maydis . Two cargos that are transported in this pathway are the pheromone receptor Pra1 and the myosin chitinsynthase Mcs1 . In yup1 ts cells Pra1 - GFP and GFP 3 - Mcs1 are internalised but accumulate in small , very likely primary endocytic vesicles within the cytoplasm and are not found in the vacuole . A similar phenotype was reported in rcy1 ∆ cells of S . cerevisiae , where an accumulation of the pheromone receptor Ste2 was found in an uncharacterised endocytic compartment ( Wiederkehr et al . , 2000 ) . The observations imply that Yup1 mediates the fusion of the incoming primary endocytic vesicles with EE and that it determines further sorting of Pra1 and Mcs1 into the degradation pathway . Although it has not yet been characterised whether U . maydis possesses an endocytic recycling compartment ( compare to Fig . 1 ) , the lack of input into EE might also affect recycling either directly from EE or from an endocytic recycling compartment ( Fig . 30 ) . 3 . 4 Endocytosis of the pheromone receptor Pra1 The second main focus of this work , after providing additional proof for the existence of endocytosis , was to elucidate the role of endocytosis for pathogenic development of U . maydis . The temperature sensitive yup1 ts mutant , which had been confirmed for a function on EE , was used as a tool in this characterisation . Yup1 ts cells were applied in assays testing for cell - cell recognition , conjugation tube formation , cell - cell fusion and host plant infection and invasion . 41 Discussion It was determined that yup1 - mediated endocytosis is already crucial for the initial steps of cell - cell recognition that depend on pheromone perception . Key player during pheromone perception is the G - protein coupled transmembrane receptor Pra1 ( Bölker et al . , 1992 ) . Similar to the yeast pheromone receptors Ste2 and Ste3 ( Davis et al . , 1993 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) , Pra1 - GFP is constitutively endocytosed in the absence of pheromone ligand . Upon pheromone stimulation , the expression of Pra1 - GFP is upregulated ( Urban et al . , 1996a ) and the fusion protein is concentrated at the tip of conjugation hyphae that are formed in response to pheromone signalling . Pra1 is endocytosed in a yup1 - mediated fashion but internalisation of Pra1 is not necessary for a function in pheromone signalling . The data suggest that Pra1 - GFP very likely cycles between early endosomes and the plasma membrane . A significant amount of Pra1 - GFP is recycled during conjugation hyphae formation ( P < 0 . 0001 ) . Nevertheless , the amount of the recycled receptor ( about 40 % of the total amount ) seems to be relatively small in comparison to the whole amount of Pra1 - GFP that is present at the tip of conjugation hyphae . The S . cerevisiae ABC - transporter Ste6 has a similar recycling behaviour ( Losko et al . , 2001 ) . It is mainly routed to the vacuole while only a minor part recycles back to the plasma membrane . Considering the artificial experimental setup additional experiments will strengthen this evidence for Pra1 recycling . Based on these findings it is suggested that a functional relation between endocytic recycling of Pra1 and pheromone perception exists in U . maydis ( Fig . 30 ) . In the absence of functional yup1 - mediated endocytosis the accumulation of Pra1 - GFP in primary endocytic vesicles leads to the depletion of the pheromone receptor molecules from the plasma membrane early during pheromone ligand binding . Ligand bound Pra1 - GFP is not sorted into EE and can neither be degraded nor undergo recycling . At the same time secretion of the pheromone receptor is not sufficient to recognize the partner pheromone , which is the reason for the pheromone perception defect of the yup1 ts mutant . This conclusion is supported by the observation that high levels of additional Pra1 can rescue the pheromone perception defect of the yup1 ts mutant . Thus , recycling of the pheromone receptor might ensure a certain level of receptor at the plasma membrane , which seems to be crucial for cell - cell recognition during initial pheromone perception . It might be that recycling becomes less important in the course of pheromone perception , which would explain why less than half of the receptor 42 Discussion molecules are recycled in conjugation hyphae ( see above ) . However , U . maydis needs a continuously high pheromone stimulation otherwise it reverts to the haploid growth form similar to the situation in S . cerevisiae ( Jenness and Spatrick , 1986 ) . The closest homologue of Pra1 in S . cerevisiae , Ste3 , is also constitutively endocytosed and after ligand - induced endocytosis recycles back to the plasma membrane ( Chen and Davis , 2000 ) . This mechanism allows the cell to reuse the receptor . In addition , the transport back to the site of ligand binding would allow the cell to polarise the receptor molecules in the direction of the pheromone source ( Chen and Davis , 2000 ) . Recycling would therefore ensure continuous growth in a pheromone gradient towards the partner cell ( Snetselaar et al . , 1996 ) . This polarized growth , including the polarized receptor cap , is seen in confrontation assays ( not shown ) but , surprisingly , also exists in in vitro assays with synthetic pheromone present from all directions . Therefore , polarized growth seems to be a default program elicited by the fungus . It questions whether endocytosis occurs explicitly at the hyphal tip or whether it takes place over the whole cell periphery . Figure 30 . Present view of Yup1 function during Pra1 endocytosis in U . maydis . After pheromone binding , ligand bound pheromone receptor is internalised in primary endocytic vesicles ( PEV ) . Yup1 functions during fusion of incoming PEVs with early endosomes ( EE ) . Pra1 is recycled from EE and transported back to the plasma membrane . It has not yet been determined whether an endosomal sorting compartment and an endosomal recycling compartment ( both belong to early endosomes , compare to Figure 1 ) exist in U . maydis . The additional role of Yup1 on vacuoles is not included . * Summarised by Kahmann and Kämper , 2004 ) . 43 Discussion 3 . 5 Additional roles for yup1 - mediated endocytosis The data summarized here suggests that endocytosis is already crucial during the first step required for the initiation of pathogenic development in U . maydis . However , it cannot be concluded directly that the lack of pheromone perception finally leads to the loss of virulence . Therefore the requirement for endocytosis beyond pheromone perception has been elucidated . The first attempt in this direction was a cross of compatible yup1 ts cells with increased pheromone receptor levels . This was based on the assumption that Pra1 and Pra2 undergo endocytosis using similar yup1 - dependend pathways . Consistently , overexpression of Pra1 and Pra2 restored pheromone perception and induced the formation of conjugation hyphae ( only shown for Pra1 in Fig . 23A ) . However , it was a clear indication that several other defects must follow pheromone perception since complemented yup1 ts cells were still non - pathogenic and also the use of a solopathogenic Ustilago strain ( Bölker et al . , 1995 ) carrying the yup1 ts mutation ( data not shown ) did not restore pathogenicity . The loss of pathogenicity in yup1 ts mutants could in the end be determined as the sum of the requirement for yup1 - mediated endocytosis in cell - cell fusion , spore formation and spore germination ( Fig . 31 ) . Plant infection and colonisation were not affected in yup1 ts mutants although microscopic observation during all developmental processes , very clearly indicated the morphological defects that were previously described for haploid cells and dikaryotic filaments of the yup1 ts mutant ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2000 ) . Presently , it can only be speculated on the cargos or components that are not sufficiently endocytosed or recycled during these developmental steps . Several components required for cell fusion have been identified in the yeast S . cerevisiae ( summarized in White and Rose , 2001 ) , It remains to be elucidated whether these compounds are present in Ustilago and if so , whether they are endocytosed and recycled in a yup1 - dependent fashion . One possible candidate would be the yeast alpha factor transporter Ste6 , which undergoes endocytic recycling ( Kelm et al . , 2004 ; Schmitz et al . , 2005 ) and has additional roles in cell - cell fusion ( Elia and Marsh , 1996 ) . A homologue of Ste6 is present in Ustilago maydis . Moreover , chitin synthases that are mediators of cell wall formation and integrity are important candidates to be further elucidated . They undergo endocytosis and recycling in S . cerevisiae ( Ziman et al . , 1996 ; Ziman et al . , 1998 ) and are required for maturation of ascospores of 44 Discussion Schizosaccharomyces pombe ( Arellano et al . , 2000 ) . Preliminary results on endocytosis of the myosin chitin synthase Mcs1 already indicate a similar situation in U . maydis . Finally , the observations that teliospore germination in U . maydis depends on endocytosis are supported by experiments in Magnaporthe grisea germlings , where it was shown that FM4 - 64 is actively taken up during germination of conidia ( Atkinson et al . , 2002 ) . Nevertheless , it remains to be seen whether the analysed components of the yup1 - mediated endocytic pathway and / or several others lead to the observed phenotypes . Figure 31 . Importance of yup1 - mediated endocytosis during life cycle and pathogenic development of Ustilago maydis . Pathogenic development of Ustilago maydis is initiated by pheromone sensing of two compatible mating partner cells . During this initial step , which is the basis for initiation of the pathogenic program , endocytosis is of essential importance ( + + + ) . However , if pheromone perception is functional subsequent formation of conjugation tubes is possible even in the absence of endocytosis while endocytosis is crucial for cell fusion ( + + ) . Growth of dikaryotic hyphae relies only to a small extent on endocytosis . Similarly penetration of the plant and growth inside the plant is possible in the absence of endocytosis ( + ) while again endocytosis becomes necessary again for the formation ( + + + ) and for germination of teliospores ( + + ) . ( + and – indicate the relevance of endocytosis during the different developmental steps . + + + indicates great relevance , - / + indicates little relevance ( Figure in cooperation with G . Steinberg ) . 45 Discussion 3 . 6 Mcs1 is an endocytic cargo in U . maydis The third important aim of the study was to identify endocytic cargos that are essential for growth and pathogenicity of U . maydis . As already described above Pra1 is one such essential cargo that requires endocytic recycling after yup1 - dependent endocytosis in U . maydis . Preliminary results from studies of the myosin chitin synthase 1 ( Mcs1 ) suggest another candidate cargo of the yup1 - mediated endocytic pathway . Very much like for Pra1 , localisation and processing of Mcs1 were altered upon shift in yup1 ts cells to restrictive conditions . This is similar to S . cerevisiase , where it was shown that the endocytic t - SNARE Tlg1 mediates trafficking of chitin synthase III ( Holthuis et al . , 1998 ) . In analogy to Yup1 , Tlg1 locates at the intersection between the endocytic and the secretory pathways and is required for delivery of chitin synthase III to the polar growth sites . All together this implies that the accumulation of Mcs1 at the poles of yup1 ts cells may also consist of primary endocytic vesicles . Similarly to Pra1 - containing PEVs , they should stain with FM4 - 64 . To further analyse Mcs1 endocytosis a yup1 ts strain is currently constructed that expresses both Pra1 and Mcs1 fused to GFP and RFP , respectively . It is the aim to elucidate whether both endocytic cargos are endocytosed in the same primary endocytic vesicles or whether they use independent endocytosis pathways . It will also be interesting to determine whether Mcs1 undergoes recycling . In addition , it needs to be elucidated whether Mcs1 , which is especially important during plant invasion ( Weber et al . , 2006 ) , is related to any of the phenotypes during U . maydis pathogenic development . 3 . 7 Summary and Outlook The presented work contributes to extend the knowledge on the role of endocytosis in filamentous fungi in general and for pathogenic development of U . maydis in particular . Through blast search analysis it was found that basically all important and regulatory components of the endocytic machinery , known from other eukaryotic systems , are present in the Ustilago genome . Furthermore , using the mutant of the endocytic t - SNARE Yup1 , it could be determined that endocytosis and endocytic recycling are important during pheromone sensing , cell - cell fusion , formation and germination of teliospores . Filamentous growth and plant colonisation are only slightly affected in the absence of endocytosis ( Fig . 31 ) . The pheromone receptor Pra1 and the myosin chitin 46 Discussion synthase Mcs1 have been identified as endocytic cargos . However , additional endocytosis mutants are needed to distinguish and to confirm the pleiotrophic phenotype observed with the yup1 ts mutant . Therefore , it should also be attempted to characterise the different endocytic compartments in U . maydis . At present the overall view of the participating components and cargos is derived from studies in higher eukaryotes and yeast ( summarized in Mukherjee et al . , 1997 ; Maxfield and McGraw , 2004 ) . Although very common concepts have been identified ( Geli and Riezman , 1998 ) , endocytosis in yeast mainly relies on the actin cytoskeleton while both actin and microtubules ( Wedlich - Söldner et al . , 2002 ) participate in endocytosis of U . maydis . This suggests a closer relation of endocytosis in U . maydis to the endocytic pathways of higher mammalian systems ( Oda et al . , 1995 ; Bananis et al . , 2000 ; Bananis et al . , 2004 ) . Preliminary observations on the long distance transport of EE in U . maydis hyphae also indicate their active transport from the hyphal tip close to the nucleus ( G . Fink , personal communication ) . From that one can also speculate on additional roles of endocytosis for cell signalling . On the one side , endocytosis regulates signalling through the removal of receptors which is a more indirect effect ( summarized by Sorkin and Von Zastrow , 2002 ) . On the other side there is a growing body of evidence indicating that endosomes directly act as intermediates in signalling between the plasma membrane and the nucleus ( Miaczynska et al . , 2004 ) . This represents a whole new area of research and although Pra1 endocytosis is not required for signalling endocytosis of other cargoes might be . Analysis and characterisation of the endosomal compartments , e . g . isolation and purification of endocytic vesicles , will in the end allow the advanced search for additional endocytic cargos . In this respect , it should be of particular interest to identify receptors for plant signals or nutrients that are active during plant invasion of U . maydis . 47 Materials and Methods 4 Materials and Methods 4 . 1 Supplies and Source of Supplies 4 . 1 . 1 Chemicals , Buffers and Solutions , Enzymes , Kits All chemicals used in this study were obtained from Fluka , Merck , Molecular Probes ( Invitrogen ) , Roth and Sigma .

Compatible Ustilago maydis strains were grown to a density of OD 600 ~ 0 . 8 and concentrated in H 2 O to an OD 600 ~ 2 . Subsequently they were equally mixed prior to infection . Cell suspensions were injected at the basal stem of 6 day old corn seedlings with a syringe . Infected plants were then incubated at 22°C or 34°C with 16 h light in a phyto - chamber for 14 days . All plant infection assays following the initial infection assays ( Fig . 2 ) were done at 31°C , since the plants tolerated the heat stress better at that temperature than at 34°C . The growth phenotype of yup1 ts mutant strains was the same at 31°C and 34°C ( not shown ) . For quantification of tumor formation plants with one or more tumors were counted , regardless of tumor size . For time course experiments wild type and yup1 ts infected plants were incubated for 1 - 7 days at 22°C each followed by a subsequent shift to 31°C and incubation for additional one and two days .
