The biofilm - like formation of 44 Cas toxin plays an important role in selective disruption on lipid membranes . 45 • Vulnerability of the specific cytoplasmic membranes to the selective Cas toxin 46 that is the most remarkable feature of cytotoxicity of Cas toxin on plant cells . 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 Abstract 59 Cassiicolin ( Cas ) , a toxin produced by Corynespora cassiicola , is responsible for 60 corynespora leaf fall disease in rubber trees . Currently , the molecular mechanism of the 61 cytotoxicity of Cas and its host selectivity have not been fully elucidated . Here , we 62 analyzed the binding of Cas1 and Cas2 to membranes consisting of different plant lipids 63 and their membrane - disruption activities . Using high - speed atomic force microscopy and 64 confocal microscopy , we reveal that the binding and disruption activities of Cas1 and 65 Cas2 on lipid membranes are strongly dependent on the specific plant lipids . The negative 66 phospholipids , glycerolipids , and sterols are more susceptible to membrane damage 67 caused by Cas1 and Cas2 than neutral phospholipids and betaine lipids . Cytotoxicity tests 68 on rubber leaves of RRIV 1 , RRIV 4 , and PB 255 clones suggest that the toxins cause 69 necrosis of rubber leaves , except for the strong resistance of PB 255 against Cas2 . Cryo - 70 SEM analyses of necrotic leaf tissues exposed to Cas1 confirm that cytoplasmic 71 membranes are vulnerable to the toxin . Thus , the host selectivity of Cas toxin is attained 72 by the lipid - dependent binding activity of Cas to the membrane , and the cytotoxicity of 73 Cas arises from its ability to form biofilm - like structures and disrupt specific membranes . 74 75 Introduction 76 The necrotrophic fungus Corynespora cassiicola ( Berk . & Curt ) Wei is a causal 77 pathogen of corynespora leaf fall ( CLF ) disease in rubber leaves , of which the typical 78 symptoms are brown leaf lesions surrounded by a yellow halo and occasional blackening 79 of the veins , which causes a symptomatic “fish - bone” appearance , resulting in massive 80 defoliation in susceptible rubber clones ( Ribeiro et al . , 2019 ) . C . cassiicola predominantly 81 infects both young and mature leaves , and CLF disease has now become widespread in 82 Hevea brasiliensis plantations , causing severe damage to the natural rubber industry . 83 These pathogens have also been found in many other crops ( Dixon et al . , 2009 ; Shrestha 84 et al . , 2017 ; Sumabat et al . , 2018 ) . Although the first pathogenic C . cassiicola isolate 85 originally from the Philippines ( CCP ) is described as a causal agent in CLF disease , a 86 necrotrophic effector known as cassiicolin ( Cas ) toxin produced in CCP is widely 87 accepted as the host - selective toxin ( HST ) interaction in rubber trees and other plants 88 ( Barthe et al . , 2007 ; de Lamotte et al . , 2007 ; Déon et al . , 2014 , 2012a ; Ribeiro et al . , 2019 ; 89 Wu et al . , 2018 ) . The Cas - encoding genes were found to be transiently expressed one or 90 two days post inoculation , suggesting a role of Cas toxin in the early phase of infection 91 ( Déon et al . , 2012a ) . Cas toxin is a small glycosylated secreted protein effector associated 92 with secondary metabolism in C . cassiicola ( Barthe et al . , 2007 ; de Lamotte et al . , 2007 ; 93 Déon et al . , 2014 , 2012a ) . To date , six cassiicolin isoforms ( Cas1 to Cas6 ) have been 94 genetically identified by PCR - based detection from fungal isolates in various host plants 95 and geographical origins ( Déon et al . , 2014 , 2012a ) . Of note , C . cassiicola isolates only 96 carry and express specific Cas genes , depending on the host specialization ( Déon et al . , 97 2014 ; Hieu et al . , 2020 ; Lopez et al . , 2018 ; Nghia et al . , 2008 ; Nguyen et al . , 2014 ) . Some 98 C . cassiicola isolates possessing no Cas gene yet causing CLF diseases may reveal other 99 putative effectors involved ( Lopez et al . , 2018 ) . The nature of the HST interaction of Cas 100 toxin in CLF disease remains controversial because in silico analysis and prediction 101 revealed 2870 putative effectors comprising CaZymes , lipases , peptidases , and secreted 102 proteins and enzymes associated with secondary metabolism of C . cassiicola ( Lopez et 103 al . , 2018 ) . However , recent studies reported that gene deletion of Cas1 in C . cassiicola 104 completely suppresses fungal pathogenicity in rubber trees ( Ribeiro et al . , 2019 ; Tran et 105 al . , 2016 ) . These studies suggested two important findings : ( i ) Cas1 is a necrotrophic 106 effector conferring virulence to C . cassiicola in susceptible rubber clones ; ( ii ) other 107 effectors produced in C . cassiicola contribute to residual filtrate toxicity and virulence in 108 senescing / wounded tissues . Thus , the putative effectors may be involved in saprotrophs 109 rather than necrotrophs . However , the cytotoxicity of Cas2 on rubber leaves has never 110 been clarified before and remains unknown . Of special interest , we further examined and 111 clarified the cytotoxicity of Cas isoforms ( i . e . , Cas1 and Cas2 ) to understand the 112 fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying the HST interaction of Cas toxin in leaves 113 of various rubber clones . In this context , the direct cytotoxicity of Cas1 to rubber leaves 114 has been explored in some previous studies ( Barthe et al . , 2007 ; de Lamotte et al . , 2007 ; 115 Déon et al . , 2012b ) . Notably , purified Cas1 applied on rubber leaves caused the same 116 symptoms as C . cassiicola did at the cellular level ( Barthe et al . , 2007 ; de Lamotte et al . , 117 2007 ) . Electron microscopic analyses of necrotic leaf tissues revealed that Cas1 severely 118 damaged plasma membranes in the chloroplast . Similarly , AK toxins from Alternaria 119 kikuchiana and fumonisins and AAL toxin from Fusarium species infecting crops and 120 plants were also reported to severely damage cytoplasmic membranes in various ways 121 ( Meena and Samal , 2019 ; Park et al . , 1976 ; Riley et al . , 1996 ; Tsuge et al . , 2013 ) . 122 Objectively , no study has sufficiently clarified the susceptibility of plant lipids such as 123 phospholipids , glycerolipids , sterols , and betaine lipids ( Bae et al . , 2020 ; Dörmann and 124 Benning , 2002 ; Dufourc , 2008a , 2008b ; Hartmann , 1998 ; Liengprayoon et al . , 2011 ; 125 Mackender and Leech , 1974 ; Murakami et al . , 2018 ; Poincelot , 1976 ) to the pathogenicity 126 of Cas toxin . 127 Alternatively , plant resistance to infectious diseases is also known to be associated 128 with several defense responses activated by host - pathogen interactions ( Thatcher et al . , 129 2005 ) . Recent transcriptomic analyses of the genetic responses of rubber clones 130 susceptible and tolerant to C . cassiicola explored the diversity of genes encoding disease 131 resistance proteins , leucine - rich repeat proteins , and genes involved in carbohydrate 132 metabolic processes that were significantly upregulated in tolerant rubber clones upon 133 infection . These genes , however , were either completely suppressed or downregulated in 134 susceptible rubber clones ( Roy et al . , 2019 ) . Again , molecular phylogenetic studies failed 135 to determine the key factor in the host selectivity of Cas toxin . The nature of the HST 136 interaction of Cas toxin in CLF disease in different rubber clones remains elusive . 137 This study addressed several key questions to elucidate the HST interaction of Cas 138 toxin with plant lipids and its cytotoxicity on rubber leaves . Specifically , we examined 139 the susceptibility of several important lipid components in plants to the pathogenicity of 140 Cas1 and Cas2 isoforms at the molecular and cellular levels by combining high - speed 141 atomic force microscopy ( HS - AFM ) , confocal microscopy , and cryo - scanning electron 142 microscopy ( Cryo - SEM ) , thereby clarifying the HST interaction of Cas1 and Cas2 143 isoforms to different plant lipids . At the cellular level , we examined the cytotoxicity of 144 Cas1 and Cas2 on rubber leaves of RRIV 1 , RRIV 4 , and PB 255 clones to understand 145 the HST interaction of Cas isoforms to specific hosts . Here , we report that the binding 146 and disruption activities of Cas1 and Cas2 are more sensitive to negatively charged lipids 147 ( DPPA ) , glycerolipids ( MGDG , DGDG ) , and sterols ( stigmasterol , sitosterol ) than to 148 neutral ( DPPC ) and betaine lipids ( DGTS - d9 , DGTS ) . Cas toxins could form biofilm - like 149 structures onto specific lipid membranes composed of negative phospholipid , 150 glycerolipids , and sterols , but failed to form these structures onto the membranes 151 composed of betaine lipids ( e . g . , DGTS - d9 ) . Cytotoxicity tests of Cas1 and Cas2 on 152 rubber leaves of RRIV 1 , RRIV 4 , and PB 255 clones suggest that these clones are highly 153 susceptible to the pathogenicity of Cas1 and Cas2 except for the strong resistance of PB 154 255 against Cas2 . Finally , we also report that cytoplasmic membranes in susceptible 155 rubber clones are highly vulnerable to the pathogenicity of purified Cas toxin and toxin 156 produced from fungus C . cassiicola . 157 158 Results 159 Disruption activity of Cas1 and Cas2 to different lipid membranes imaged by HS - 160 AFM 161 To examine the possible pathogenicity of Cas1 and Cas2 , this study addressed the 162 first question of whether Cas1 and Cas2 could bind to and disrupt various phospholipids 163 ( DPPC , DPPA ) , glycerolipids ( MGDG , DGDG ) , sterols ( stigmasterol , sitosterol ) , and 164 betaine lipids ( DGTS - d9 , DGTS ) available in plants . To answer this question , we used 165 tapping - mode HS - AFM to image the dynamic interaction and disruption activities of 166 Cas1 and Cas2 to different lipid membranes in real time . Unlike a conventional AFM , 167 which has a slow scanning rate , HS - AFM can image in sub - second temporal resolution 168 many biological molecules during functional activities ( Ando , 2012 ; Ando et al . , 2013 , 169 2008 , 2007 ; Uchihashi et al . , 2012 ) . The very soft and small cantilever used in HS - AFM 170 was proven in numerous previous reports to non - invasively perturb the structures and 171 functions of biological molecules ( Kodera et al . , 2010 ; Lin et al . , 2020 ; Ngo et al . , 2015 ; 172 Uchihashi et al . , 2011 ) . This microscopy enables real - time , high - resolution imaging of 173 individual biological nanomachines during their functional activities , as demonstrated by 174 studies on walking myosin V ( Kodera et al . , 2010 ) , rotorless F1 - ATPase ( Uchihashi et al . , 175 2011 ) , and actin filaments interacting with cofilin ( Ngo et al . , 2015 ) , and recently explores 176 many undiscovered features of many other inspired biomolecules ( Ando , 2018 ; Heath 177 and Scheuring , 2019 ; Karner et al . , 2017 ; Kodera et al . , 2020 ; Lin et al . , 2020 ; Nasrallah 178 et al . , 2019 ; Shibata et al . , 2017 ) . 179 We produced Cas1 and Cas2 recombinant proteins in E . coli . The basic characteristics 180 of these proteins are described in Figure 1 - figure supplements 1 , 2 , and Figure 1 - tables 181 1 , 2 . Our analysis predicted that a signal peptide ( SP ) domain in Cas1 and Cas2 containing 182 several different hydrophobic amino acids ( M , Y , L , I , A , F , V ) may help to better insert 183 these proteins into the hydrophobic region of a lipid bilayer . The numbers of negatively 184 and positively charged residues in Cas1 and Cas2 are identical . However , the secondary 185 structures ( α - helix , β - sheet , and β - turn ) in the mature domains of Cas1 and Cas2 are 186 locally different ( see red and yellow rectangles in Figure 1 - figure supplement 1 ) . To 187 follow the binding and disruption activities of Cas1 and Cas2 on preformed lipid 188 membranes in solution , Cas1 or Cas2 was added into the imaging chamber at a final 189 concentration of 0 . 95 µM during HS - AFM imaging . Initially , we found that neutral 190 phospholipid ( DPPC ) membranes were weakly sensitive to the binding and disruption 191 activities of Cas1 and Cas2 ( Figures 1a1 , a2 , d - a1 , d - a2 , Figure 1 - figure supplement 3 , 192 Table 1 , and Videos 1 – 2 ) . Thus , we made several composite lipid membranes by mixing 193 with DPPC lipids to investigate their susceptibility to the pathogenicity of Cas1 and Cas2 . 194 As shown in Figures 1b1 , d - b1 , c1 , d - c1 , d1 , d - d1 , b2 , d - b2 , c2 , d - c2 , d2 , and d - d2 , 195 Table 1 , and Videos 3 – 8 , the negatively charged phospholipid ( DPPC / DPPA ) and 196 glycerolipid ( DPPC / MGDG , DPPC / DGDG ) mixtures were highly sensitive to the 197 binding and disruption activities of Cas1 and Cas2 . The DPPC / stigmasterol and 198 DPPC / sitosterol membranes were also strongly susceptible to the binding and disruption 199 activities of both Cas1 and Cas2 ( Figures 1e1 , d - e1 , e2 , d - e2 , f1 , d - f1 , f2 , and d - f2 , Table 200 1 , and Videos 9 – 12 ) . The lipid membrane mixtures of betaine lipids ( DPPC / DGTS - d9 , 201 DPPC / DGTS ) were weakly vulnerable to Cas1 and Cas2 ( Figures 1g1 , d - g1 , h1 , d - h1 , 202 g2 , d - g2 , h2 , and d - h2 , Table 1 , and Videos 13 – 16 ) . 203 In this study , our real - time HS - AFM imaging Videos revealed that Cas1 and Cas2 204 were strongly bound to membranes containing negatively charged phospholipid ( DPPA ) , 205 glycerolipids ( MGDG , DGDG ) , and sterols ( stigmasterol , sitosterol ) and penetrated 206 deeply into the lipid membranes . Cas1 and Cas2 formed large clusters on these highly 207 susceptible membrane lipids and expanded their clusters , similar to tsunamis , to devastate 208 the membranes ( Figures 1b1 , b2 , c1 , c2 , d1 , d2 , e1 , e2 , f1 , and f2 , and Videos 3 – 10 ) . 209 By acting in these ways , they continuously damage lipid membranes . After disruption , 210 many aggregates left on mica were observed . These aggregates were likely a mixture 211 composed of lipids and Cas1 or Cas2 . Our results also show that neutral DPPC lipids 212 were weakly susceptible to the binding and disruption activity of both Cas1 and Cas2 213 ( Figures 1a1 , d - a1 , a2 , d - a2 , and Videos 1 – 2 ) . This statement is firmly supported in 214 the observation of the disruption activity of Cas1 and Cas2 to DPPC domains and DGDG 215 domains segregated in DPPC / DGDG membranes ( Figure 2B , 2D , and Videos 7 – 8 ) . 216 The DPPC and DGDG lipid domains formed on the mica surface were distinguished by 217 a height difference of ~ 1 . 5 – 1 . 9 nm . Cas clusters were also distinguished by measuring 218 the height differences with membranes and are representatively shown for Cas1 and Cas2 219 clusters ( Figure 2 ) . DGDG domains were strongly devastated by Cas1 and Cas2 clusters , 220 while DPPC domains remained almost intact ( kymographs in Figures 2E and 2F ) . Based 221 on this observation , we further confirmed that glycerolipids ( MGDG , DGDG ) are 222 strongly susceptible to the disruption activity of Cas1 and Cas2 . Most likely , the 223 negatively charged surface and high membrane fluidity of glycerolipids are two key 224 factors for better binding , accessibility , and damage activity of Cas1 and Cas2 clusters in 225 these membranes . We further tested membrane accessibility for the disruption activity of 226 Cas1 and Cas2 by incorporating sterols ( stigmasterol , sitosterol ) into the membranes . The 227 presence of plant sterols in membranes was expected to increase the membrane 228 accessibility for Cas1 and Cas2 , although sterols are generally thought to decrease the 229 membrane fluidity ( Dufourc , 2008a , 2008b ) . Indeed , these membranes were greatly 230 devastated by Cas1 and Cas2 . The disruption activities of Cas toxin on these membranes 231 happened regardless of the Cas cluster formation or not ( Figures 1e1 , d - e1 , e2 , d - e2 , f1 , 232 d - f1 , f2 , and d - f2 and Videos 9 – 12 ) . Additionally , when neutral betaine lipids ( DGTS - 233 d9 , DGTS ) were mixed with DPPC lipids , these membranes were only weakly damaged 234 by Cas1 and Cas2 . The degrees of damage of Cas1 and Cas2 on these membranes were 235 similar to those on pure DPPC membranes ( Figures 1a1 , d - a1 , a2 , d - a2 , g1 , d - g1 , g2 , d - 236 g2 , h1 , d - h1 , h2 , and d - h2 , and Videos 1 – 2 , 13 – 16 ) . Overall , we suggest that 237 negatively charged phospholipids , glycerolipids , and specific sterols available in the 238 cytoplasmic membranes of plant cells are strongly sensitive to the disruption activity of 239 Cas1 and Cas2 . Neutral phospholipids and betaine membrane lipids are weakly 240 susceptible to the disruption activity of Cas1 and Cas2 . 241 242 Biofilm - like formation of Cas toxin onto specific lipid membranes 243 To examine whether biofilm - like structures of Cas toxin could be formed on specific 244 lipid membranes , we used HS - AFM and imaged in realtime the binding of Cas toxin to 245 the preformed lipid membranes in solution . Generally , the formation of the infectious 246 microbial biofilms plays various important roles such as tolerance to the host immune 247 system , cell adhesion , serve as a reservoir for cell division ( Mancera et al . , 2020 ) , and 248 nutritive absorption , protective barrier , development of reproductive and vegetative 249 structures ( i . e . , fungal spore and hyphae ) , and sexual and asexual reproduction ( Gour et 250 al . , 2014 ; Siqueira and Lima , 2013 ) . 251 In this study , we used a high concentration of Cas1 and Cas2 ( 4 . 75 µM ) and compared 252 the biofilm - like formation of Cas toxin on two different lipid membrane surfaces ( i . e . , the 253 susceptible DPPC / sitosterol vs . the non - susceptible DPPC / DGTS - d9 membranes ) . We 254 found that the lipid membranes composed of DPPC / sitosterol strongly recruited the 255 binding and biofilm - like formation of the Cas1 / Cas2 mixture ( Figure 3A , Video 17 ) . The 256 biofilm of the Cas1 / Cas2 mixture was covered and partially incorporated onto membranes . 257 The biofilm thickness of the Cas1 / Cas2 mixture was approximately 5 – 6 . 5 nm , and its 258 height protruded over the membrane surface was ~ 1 – 1 . 5 nm ( Figure 3A ) . Consequently , 259 the disruption activities of the Cas1 / Cas2 mixture on these membranes were very strong 260 ( Figure 3A , Video 17 ) . These membranes also recruited the biofilm - like formation of 261 Cas2 . The biofilm - like structures of Cas2 were covered on the membrane surface with a 262 thickness of ~ 0 . 3 – 0 . 5 nm ( Figure 3B , Video 18 ) . Contrarily , the lipid membranes made 263 of DPPC / DGTS - d9 failed to form the biofilm - like structures of the Cas1 / Cas2 mixture . 264 Despite a combination of Cas1 and Cas2 at a high concentration , the Cas1 / Cas2 clusters 265 were partially incorporated into membranes and yet weakly disrupted these membranes 266 ( Figure 3C , Video 19 ) . Additionally , Cas1 and Cas2 at a lower concentration ( ~ 0 . 95 µM ) 267 could also form biofilm - like structures on membranes containing negative phospholipid 268 ( DPPC / DPPA ) ( Figures 1b1 , b2 , Videos 3 – 4 ) and glycerolipid ( DPPC / DGDG ) 269 ( Figures 1d1 , d2 , Videos 7 – 8 ) . Biofilm - like formation of Cas1 was also seen on 270 membranes containing glycerolipid ( DPPC / MGDG ) ( Figure 1c1 , Video 5 ) . We suggest 271 here , for the first time , that biofilm - like structures of Cas toxin can be formed onto 272 specific lipid membranes available in plant cells ( i . e . , negative phospholipid , 273 glycerolipids , and sterol ) . The effective biofilm - like formation of the Cas1 / Cas2 mixtures 274 onto specific lipid membranes may also reflect the nature of Cas toxin production and 275 virulence of C . cassiicola possessing various Cas isoforms when they infect and grow on 276 rubber leaves . 277 278 Binding of Cas1 and Cas2 to artificial cytoplasmic membranes imaged by confocal 279 microscopy 280 We further examined the susceptibility of intact lipid membranes to the binding of 281 Cas1 and Cas2 using confocal microscopy . Thus , we fabricated giant liposome vesicles 282 ( GVs ) and used them as a model of artificial cytoplasmic membranes to assay the binding 283 activities of GFP - Cas1 and GFP - Cas2 using confocal microscopy , a powerful technique 284 to study protein - lipid membrane interaction ( Carvalho et al . , 2008 ; Drücker et al . , 2019 ) . 285 The composite GVs composed of similar lipid compositions used in HS - AFM 286 observation were made by electroformation methods ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 3 and 287 Figure 4 - table 1 ) . Here , we mainly compared the binding of GFP - Cas1 and GFP - Cas2 288 to different GVs made of DPPC , DPPC / DPPA , DPPC / MGDG , DPPC / DGDG , 289 DPPC / stigmasterol , DPPC / sitosterol , DPPC / DGTS - d9 , and DPPC / DGTS lipid mixtures 290 with the small addition of rhodamine - PE and biotinyl - PE lipids to absorb and image GVs . 291 Principally , we fabricated GVs containing both giant unilamellar and multilamellar 292 vesicles and used them to assay the binding activity of GFP - Cas1 and GFP - Cas2 ( Figure 293 4 , Tables 1 , 2 ) . The binding of GFP - Cas1 and GFP - Cas2 to GVs made of only neutral 294 phospholipids ( DPPCs ) was indeed weak ( Figures 4a1 , a2 , i1 , i2 ) . Most DPPC GVs were 295 not bound with GFP - Cas1 and GFP - Cas2 . Thus , we used DPPC as the basal lipid 296 membrane to compare the binding degrees of GFP - Cas1 and GFP - Cas2 to GVs composed 297 of negative phospholipids ( DPPC / DPPA ) , glycerolipids ( DPPC / MGDG , DPPC / DGDG ) , 298 sterols ( DPPC / stigmasterol , DPPC / sitosterol ) , and neutral betaine lipids ( DPPC / DGTS - 299 d9 , DPPC / DGTS ) . GFP - Cas1 was bound more strongly to GVs composed of 300 DPPC / DPPA , DPPC / MGDG , and DPPC / DGDG lipids than to GVs made of only DPPC 301 ( Figures 4a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 , i1 ) . The susceptibility of GVs composed of DPPC / stigmasterol , 302 DPPC / sitosterol , DPPC / DGTS - d9 , and DPPC / DGTS lipids to the binding of GFP - Cas1 303 was also recorded as strong ( Figures 4e1 , f1 , g1 , h1 ) , although when compared to the 304 binding of GFP - Cas1 to GVs made of only DPPC ( Figure a1 ) , the difference ( p ≤ 0 . 05 , 305 t - test ) was not significant ( Figure 4i1 , Table 2 ) . Additionally , we found that GFP - Cas2 306 bound more strongly to all GVs composed of the negative phospholipids , glycerolipids , 307 sterols , and betaine lipids used in this study compared to GVs made of only the neutral 308 DPPC phospholipids ( Figures 4a2 , b2 , c2 , d2 , e2 , f2 , g2 , h2 , i2 ) . These results strongly 309 support that both GFP - Cas1 and GFP - Cas2 were bound to suspended lipid membranes , 310 similar to artificial cytoplasmic membranes composed of the specific plant lipids . The 311 binding of GFP - Cas1 and GFP - Cas2 was varied and dependent on the types of lipids . 312 Although we did not evaluate the disruption of these lipid membranes caused by GFP - 313 Cas1 and GFP - Cas2 using confocal microscopy , we consistently captured the large bright 314 clusters of GFP - Cas1 and GFP - Cas2 formed in the susceptible lipid membranes ( see GFP 315 fluorescence in Figures 4b1 , b2 , c1 , d1 , e2 , f2 , g2 , h2 ) . This observation also implies that 316 the susceptible lipid components available in plants ( PA , MGDG , DGDG , stigmasterol , 317 and sitosterol ) recruited the binding and formation of Cas1 and Cas2 clusters in the lipid 318 membranes , as seen in our HS - AFM observation . Most likely , the formation and 319 expansion of the large Cas1 and Cas2 clusters in susceptible lipid membranes play crucial 320 roles in devastating lipid membranes . 321 322 Cytotoxicity of Cas1 and Cas2 on rubber leaves 323 To examine the cytotoxicity of Cas1 and Cas2 on rubber leaves at the cellular level , 324 this study addressed the second question of whether Cas1 and Cas2 could directly damage 325 and cause necrosis in rubber leaf tissues . Here , we tested the cytotoxicity of Cas1 and 326 Cas2 on freshly detached young rubber leaves of highly susceptible clones ( H . 327 brasiliensis RRIV 1 and RRIV 4 ) and weakly susceptible clones ( H . brasiliensis PB 255 ) , 328 as reported previously ( Hieu et al . , 2020 ; Nguyen et al . , 2014 ) . In these experiments , 6 – 329 10 small spots on a rubber leaf’s lower lamina side were slightly scraped on the cuticle 330 surface before applying 0 . 083 µg Cas1 or Cas2 to each spot . We evaluated the cytotoxicity 331 of Cas1 and Cas2 on rubber leaves by observing the color change and the size change in 332 the lesion spots . As seen in Figure 5 , neither Cas1 nor Cas2 caused any noticeable damage 333 or color change in the infected spots of all rubber leaves after incubation for 24 h . 334 However , a green to brown color change was seen in some leaf lesion spots of susceptible 335 RRIV 1 and RRIV 4 rubber clones infected with Cas1 and Cas2 after incubation for 72 h . 336 The necrotic areas in the leaf lesion spots were largely expanded and seen after incubation 337 for 120 h ( Figures 5a1 , a2 , b1 , b2 ) . In the case of the PB 255 rubber clone , necrosis in 338 the leaf lesion spots was developed and seen after treatment with Cas1 for 72 and 120 h 339 ( Figure 5c1 ) . However , necrosis in the leaf lesion spots developed very slowly and was 340 not clearly seen after treatment with Cas2 for 120 h ( Figure 5c2 ) . This observation 341 suggests that the cytotoxicity of Cas1 and Cas2 on the rubber leaves of a PB 255 clone 342 was different . Noticeably , some leaf spots infected with Cas1 changed from green to 343 brown and black colors ( see black circles in Figures 5a1 , b1 , c1 ) , while those infected 344 with Cas2 only changed from green to brown color ( Figures 5a2 , b2 ) . The blackened 345 necrosis seen in lesion spots infected with Cas1 implies that Cas1 damaged leaf tissues 346 more severely than Cas2 . Once the damage of Cas1 and Cas2 on leaf tissues began , leaf 347 tissue necrosis continuously developed and expanded in large areas . The cytotoxicity 348 assay on rubber leaves ( RRIV 4 clone ) with fungus C . cassiicola showed that the necrotic 349 leaf tissues surrounding filamentous fungi were produced and clearly seen at day5 and 350 day7 post inoculation ( see brown halos , Figure 5d ) . This result suggest that Cas toxins 351 were made and secreted from fungus to damage the surrounding leaf tissues . Overall , we 352 demonstrated that both Cas1 and Cas2 could directly cause necrosis in the leaves of some 353 rubber clones . Our report also supports the previous finding of the cytotoxicity of Cas1 354 produced in C . cassiicola resulting in necrosis in rubber leaves ( Ribeiro et al . , 2019 ) . 355 Indeed , the cytotoxicity of Cas2 on rubber leaves has never been reported before . Here , 356 we additionally report that Cas2 directly damaged and caused necrosis in rubber leaves . 357 358 Dissecting cellular structures of rubber leaves using cryo - SEM 359 This study addressed the third question of how Cas toxin could damage cellular and 360 tissue structures in rubber leaves . To answer this question , we used low voltage cryo - SEM 361 to anatomize the cellular and tissue structures in the leaf lesion spots developed in rubber 362 leaves of susceptible RRIV 4 clones after infection with Cas1 for ~ 120 h and compared 363 them to the structures in healthy control leaves . Indeed , ultralow - temperature and low - 364 voltage cryo - SEM has been proven to be a powerful technique for dissecting pristinely 365 fractured biological cells without conductive metal coatings ( Osumi et al . , 2006 ) . 366 The lamina , cuticle , upper and lower epidermis , palisade mesophyll , and spongy 367 mesophyll in the healthy control leaves preserved their healthy cellular structures , which 368 were identified easily ( Figures 6A , B , C , D , and Figure 6 - figure supplement 1 ) . 369 Additionally , intact cell walls and cytoplasmic membranes could be seen clearly in the 370 fractured leaf tissues ( Figures 6C , D , and Figure 6 - figure supplement 1 ) . In contrast , 371 Cas1 strongly damaged the cellular and tissue structures in leaf lesion spots ( Figures 6E 372 and Figure 6 - figure supplement 1 ) . The upper and lower epidermis , spongy , and 373 palisade parenchyma were devastated by Cas1 . The cellular boundaries , such as cell walls 374 and cytoplasmic membranes , in the fractured leaf tissues were hardly distinguished . 375 Strikingly , large areas of cytoplasmic membranes in palisade mesophyll were found to be 376 severely devastated by Cas1 . The binding of Cas1 clusters , pore formation , biofilm - like 377 formation , and expansion of Cas1 clusters at different degrees in the cytoplasmic 378 membranes were clearly observed ( see white rectangles in Figure 6E , Figure 6 - figure 379 supplement 1 ) . Our results strongly suggest that cytoplasmic membranes were highly 380 vulnerable to the pathogenicity of Cas1 . This mechanism may also be similarly applied 381 to understand the cytotoxicity of Cas2 on the leaves of susceptible rubber clones , although 382 it needs to be verified . 383 384 Discussion 385 Cytoplasmic membrane vulnerability to Cas toxin plays a crucial role in HST 386 interactions 387 Cytoplasmic membranes are essential in all living cells . In plant cells , life strongly 388 relies on the presence of a healthy functional cytoplasmic membrane enveloping the 389 cytosol , thereby forming a boundary between the internal and external cytosolic 390 environments . The cytoplasmic membrane plays pivotal roles in protecting cytosolic 391 contents , such as the chloroplast , Golgi apparatus , mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , 392 and nucleus , and furnishing a sophisticated lipid environment for various vital activities 393 across membranes , such as the transport activities of protein channels and transporters 394 ( Assmann and Haubrick , 1996 ; Kang et al . , 2011 ; Maure et al . , 2008 ) . Phospholipids ( PC , 395 PA ) , glycerolipids ( MGDG , DGDG ) , sterols ( stigmasterol , sitosterol ) , and betaine lipids 396 ( DGTS - d9 , DGTS ) are present in the cytoplasmic membranes of plant cells ( Bae et al . , 397 2020 ; Dörmann and Benning , 2002 ; Dufourc , 2008a , 2008b ; Hartmann , 1998 ; 398 Liengprayoon et al . , 2011 ; Mackender and Leech , 1974 ; Murakami et al . , 2018 ; Poincelot , 399 1976 ) , 53 . The vulnerability of cytoplasmic membranes to Cas1 has been reported 400 previously ( Barthe et al . , 2007 ; de Lamotte et al . , 2007 ) . When observing the 401 ultrastructures of the necrotic leaf tissues caused by Cas1 , they found that Cas1 severely 402 damaged the plasma membrane . Plasmolysis ( e . g . , membrane permeability ) was modified . 403 The neutral deuterated ( 2 H ) DPC membrane was weakly susceptible to Cas1 , although 404 they could not rule out the interaction of Cas1 with other lipid classes ( Barthe et al . , 2007 ) . 405 In this study , we showed that both Cas1 and Cas2 could directly damage and cause 406 necrosis in the leaves of some susceptible rubber clones . Our electron microscopic 407 analyses strongly suggest that cytoplasmic membranes were highly vulnerable to the 408 pathogenicity of Cas toxin ( Figures 6E and Figure 6 - figure supplement 1 ) , supporting 409 the previous finding that Cas1 could damage cytoplasmic membranes ( Barthe et al . , 2007 ; 410 de Lamotte et al . , 2007 ) . We also explored here that the negative phospholipids ( DPPA ) , 411 glycerolipids ( MGDG , DGDG ) , and sterols ( stigmasterol , sitosterol ) available in 412 cytoplasmic membranes play key roles in the binding and disruption activity of Cas1 and 413 Cas2 to the cytoplasmic membrane . Neutral phospholipids ( DPPC ) and betaine lipids 414 ( DGTS - d9 , DGTS ) are indeed weakly sensitive to the disruption activities of Cas1 and 415 Cas2 . Our finding is crucial to understand the binding and disruption selectivity of Cas 416 toxin to different lipid compositions in cytoplasmic membranes . 417 Studying the HST interaction of Cas isoforms with lipid membranes is crucial to 418 understand the host - selective pathogen in CLF disease . Currently , the exact mechanism 419 remains unclear . In general , mycotoxins are categorized as host - specific or nonspecific 420 toxins . Some plant pathogenic fungi can synthesize mycotoxins as secondary metabolites 421 that act as virulence factors to develop severe fungal infections ( Meena and Samal , 2019 ; 422 Petrov et al . , 2018 ; Takaoka et al . , 2014 ) . Several important organelles inside plant cells , 423 such as the cytoplasmic membrane , chloroplasts , mitochondria , and endoplasmic 424 reticulum , have previously been suggested as target sites of selective AK toxins ( Tsuge et 425 al . , 2013 ) . In particular , selective AK and fumonisin toxins were reported to damage or 426 modify cytoplasmic membranes in various ways ( Park et al . , 1976 ; Riley et al . , 1996 ) . 427 Here , we demonstrated that Cas1 and Cas2 directly damaged and caused necrosis in the 428 leaves of susceptible rubber clones ( RRIV 1 , RRIV 4 , and PB 255 ) . RRIV 1 and RRIV 4 429 clones were sensitive to both Cas1 and Cas2 ( Figures 5a1 , a2 , b1 , b2 ) . Strikingly , a PB 430 255 clone was strongly resistant to Cas2 but susceptible to Cas1 ( Figures 5c1 , c2 ) . These 431 results suggest that the cytotoxicity of the Cas1 and Cas2 isoforms varied in different 432 rubber clones , depending on the susceptibility of cytoplasmic membranes to the binding 433 and disruption of Cas toxin . 434 435 Biofilm - like formation of Cas toxin and its physiological implication 436 Strikingly , we also disclose that Cas toxin can form biofilm - like structures onto 437 specific lipid membranes composed of negative phospholipid ( DPPA ) , glycerolipids 438 ( MGDG , DGDG ) , and sterol ( sitosterol ) ( Figures 1b1 , b2 , c1 , d1 , d2 , and 3A , B , and 439 Videos 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 17 , 18 ) . However , these biofilm - like structures are not formed on 440 lipid membranes composed of betaine lipids ( DGTS - d9 ) ( Figure 3C , Video 19 ) . Our 441 realtime HS - AFM observation supports that the highly susceptible lipid membranes 442 containing negative phospholipid , glycerolipids , and sterol can recruit the binding of Cas1 443 and Cas2 onto their surfaces to form biofilm - like structures . The biofilms are either 444 covered on the membrane surface or partially incorporated onto the lipid membrane and 445 cause severe damage on membranes . Most likely , the biofilm - like formation of Cas toxin 446 also plays an important role in damaging cytoplasmic membranes , as seen in Cryo - SEM 447 images ( Figure 6E , Figure 6 - figure supplement 1 ) . 448 Finally , we hypothesized the molecular mechanism of the host - selective toxic 449 interaction of Cas toxin with specific lipid membranes and its cytotoxicity on the 450 susceptible rubber leaves ( Figure 7 ) . The brown and black necrotic halos of leaf tissues 451 surrounding necrotrophic fungus C . cassiicola infected in rubber leaves are caused by the 452 selective Cas toxin secreted during the growth and invasion of fungus . The Cas toxin 453 binds to and strongly disrupts the specific and susceptible membrane lipids such as 454 negative phospholipids , glycerolipids , and sterols available in cytoplasmic membranes of 455 the specific plant cells . PA , MGDG , DGDG , and sitosterol lipids available in cytoplasmic 456 membranes may play an important role to recruit the binding and formation of biofilm - 457 like structures of Cas toxin onto cytoplasmic membranes . The selective binding and 458 disruption activities of Cas toxin on specific cytoplasmic membranes cause plasmolysis 459 and eventually cell death . 460 461 Methods 462 Materials 463 DNA oligonucleotides encoding cassiicolin ( Cas ) genes ( Cas1 and Cas2 ) of 464 Corynespora cassiicola causing CLF disease in rubber trees ( Déon et al . , 2014 , 2012b , 465 2012a ) were purchased from IDT ( Tokyo Japan ) . The PcoldGFP plasmid was a generous 466 gift from Prof . Taro Q . P . Uyeda ( Waseda University , Japan ) . All necessary primers used 467 for PCR and cloning Cas1 , Cas2 , GFP - Cas1 , and GFP - Cas2 were purchased from 468 Macrogen Japan ( Tokyo , Japan ) . The oligonucleotides and amino acid sequences of Cas1 469 and Cas2 used in this study are summarized in Table S5 . All synthetic lipids available in 470 plants were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabama , USA ) . The structures and 471 physical properties of these lipids are clarified and summarized in Figure S3 . 472 473 Protein preparation 474 The genes encoding Cas1 and Cas2 proteins were similarly inserted into the pColdI 475 vector at the KpnI and XbaI sites ( Ngo et al . , 2015 ) . Similarly , the PcoldGFP vector 476 ( generated two cloning sites by BamHI and HindIII ) was employed to construct GFP - 477 Cas1 and GFP - Cas2 proteins . The successfully constructed plasmids for the expression 478 of Cas1 , Cas2 , GFP - Cas1 , and GFP - Cas2 genes were confirmed by DNA oligonucleotide 479 sequences . All recombinant proteins containing a 6xHis - tag on the N - terminus ( Table S5 ) 480 were designed for purification using a Ni - NTA resin column . For simplicity , we 481 consistently designated these recombinant proteins as Cas1 , Cas2 , GFP - Cas1 , and GFP - 482 Cas2 . 483 Cas1 , Cas2 , GFP - Cas1 , and GFP - Cas2 were expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) E . coli 484 according to the manufacturer’s instructions for PcoldI ( Takara ) . Briefly , the transfected 485 E . coli cells were grown in LB broth containing 100 µg / ml ampicillin and 10 µg / ml 486 methyl 3 - O ( alpha - D - mannopyranosyl ) - alpha - D - mannopyranoside ( MDMDM ) to an 487 OD600 of ~ 0 . 6 . Then , the cell suspension was cooled to 15°C on ice . Protein expression 488 was induced by adding 1 mM IPTG . The cell suspension was continuously fermented in 489 a shaking incubator at 140 rpm and 15°C for 24 h . Then , the cells were harvested by low 490 centrifugation ( 4000 rpm , 10 min , 4°C ) . The cell pellet was gently washed twice with 491 cold 10 mM Tris - HCl buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Next , the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer 492 containing 50 mM Tris - HCl buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 300 mM KCl , 5 mM EGTA , 20 mM 493 imidazole ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 1 % ( w / v ) lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol ( LMNG ) ( Anatrace ) , 10 494 mM β - mercaptoethanol , proteinase inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma ) , and 1 mM PMSF . Cell 495 lysis was carried out overnight in a rotary incubator at 4°C . Next , the cells were finally 496 disrupted using a French press ( repeated twice , ~ 140 MPa ) . After low centrifugation 497 ( 15 , 000 rpm , 15 min , 4°C ) , the crude protein solution was finally collected by 498 ultracentrifugation ( 40 , 000 rpm , 30 min , 4°C ) and subsequently incubated with Ni - NTA 499 ( GE healthcare ) resin for 2 h at 4°C . The resin was recovered and transferred into a clean 500 plastic column for washing . The resin was washed carefully in cold wash buffer 501 containing 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 20 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 1 M NaCl and 10 mM 502 β - mercaptoethanol until proteins in the washout solution were undetectable . Elution of 503 proteins was carried out with elution buffer containing 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 800 504 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 4 ) and 10 mM β - mercaptoethanol . The eluate was dialyzed against 505 dialysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 50 mM KCl , 50 % glycerol , and 10 506 mM β - mercaptoethanol using a dialysis membrane ( MWCO 3300 Da ) overnight at 4°C . 507 The dialysate was recovered and concentrated and finally subjected to low centrifugation 508 ( 15 , 000 rpm , 10 min , 4°C ) to remove any protein aggregates . Protein concentration was 509 measured by the Bradford method or UV absorption ( Cas1 : ε 280 = 8855 M - 1 . cm - 1 or A 280 510 = 0 . 984 ( 1 mg / ml ) , 9003 . 27 Da ; Cas2 : ε 280 = 8855 M - 1 . cm - 1 or A 280 = 0 . 981 ( 1 mg / ml ) , 511 9025 . 28 Da ; GFP - Cas1 : ε 280 = 29380 M - 1 . cm - 1 or A 280 = 0 . 830 ( 1 mg / ml ) , 35400 . 95 KDa ; 512 GFP - Cas2 : ε 280 = 29380 M - 1 . cm - 1 or A 280 = 0 . 815 ( 1 mg / ml ) , 35422 . 07 KDa ) . Small 513 aliquots of proteins were snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80°C . The activities 514 of target proteins were characterized by common biochemical assays , mass spectrometry , 515 HS - AFM , confocal microscopy , cryo - SEM , and cytotoxicity assays on rubber leaves . 516 517 Giant liposome vesicles 518 We made giant liposome vesicles ( GVs ) from different lipids available in plants for 519 imaging the binding of GFP - Cas1 and GFP - Cas2 to different lipid membranes using 520 confocal microscopy . The electroformation methods for making GVs have been well 521 established in several previous studies ( Angelova and Dimitrov , 2007 , 1986 ; Dimitrov 522 and Angelova , 1988 ) . The lipid compositions are described in Table S3 and clarified in 523 Figure S3 . Briefly , the lipid mixtures dissolved in chloroform were stored at - 20°C . The 524 mixtures were warmed at room temperature for 10 min . A 20 µl lipid mixture was 525 thoroughly spread on indium tin oxide ( ITO ) - coated glass slides ( Nanion , Germany ) . The 526 dried thin film was formed by the complete evaporation of chloroform at room 527 temperature for approximately 10 min . To make GVs on the ITO - coated glass slide , we 528 used a Vesicle Prep Pro ( Nanion , Germany ) . An O - ring with a diameter of 16 mm was 529 used to make a chamber furnishing the dried thin film inside . A 250 µl filter sterile 530 electroformation buffer containing 1 M D - sorbitol , 1 mM EGTA , and 2 mM HEPES - 531 NaOH ( pH 7 . 4 ) was applied into a chamber sandwiched between two conductive sides of 532 the ITO - coated glass slides . The protocol for making GVs was set up as follows : Initial 533 ( 0 V , 5 Hz , 50°C , 5 min ) ; Start ( 3 V , 10 Hz , 50°C , 10 min ) ; Main ( 3 V , 10 Hz , 50°C , 60 534 min ) ; Fall ( 0 V , 10 Hz , 50°C , 5 min ) ; End ( 0 V , 10 Hz , 20°C ) . The formed GVs were 535 gently collected and stably stored at 4°C for approximately 1 – 2 weeks . 536 537 Confocal microscopy 538 The FluoroDish cell culture dishes ( FD35 - 100 , WPI ) were cleaned by dipping in 3 539 M KOH solution for 1 h , subsequently washed in Milli - Q water approximately 10 times , 540 dried at 60°C for 1 h or more , and stored at room temperature before use . GV solution 541 ( ~ 0 . 8 mM lipid ) was diluted in imaging buffer containing 5 mM HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 542 5 mM NaCl , 0 . 05 mM EDTA , and 1 M D - sorbitol to a final lipid concentration of ~ 0 . 2 543 mM . To assay the binding of Cas1 or Cas2 to different lipid membranes , we gently mixed 544 9 . 5 µM GFP - Cas1 or GFP - Cas2 with 100 µl of diluted GV solution , incubated the mixture 545 at room temperature for 5 min , and subsequently introduced the mixture into a cleaned 546 FluoroDish . In most cases , we could image the GVs weakly absorbing onto the glass 547 surface by gravity force . Only in the case of negatively charged DPPC / DPPA GVs did we 548 further added 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl 2 into the imaging buffer for better 549 absorption of these GVs onto the glass surface . 550 Confocal imaging experiments were performed in a STED confocal microscopy 551 ( Abberior Instruments , Germany ) . We used a 100x oil - immersed objective lens 552 ( NA = 1 . 46 ) . Images were taken using Imspector software . Two channel images were 553 acquired one by one for each pixel at 50 x 50 x50 nm resolution per xyz pixel . 554 The confocal imaging conditions were set up as follows : SiR channel ( Ex : 652 nm ) for 555 rhodamine , EGFP channel ( Ex : 489 nm ) for GFP , 15 % laser power source used for both 556 channels . The images were analyzed using Fiji - ImageJ ( NIH , USA ) . Initially , we 557 corrected the background for both channels . After a Gaussian - blur filter ( sigma radius 558 = 2 . 0 ) was applied , the images were converted to binary images with a minimum 559 threshold set value of 12 for measuring the pixel areas in each channel . The rhodamine 560 area where Cas is not bound was calculated by subtracting the GFP channel from the 561 rhodamine channel . Then , the relative fluorescence area was calculated for a quantitative 562 comparison of the binding area of GFP - Cas1 and GFP - Cas2 to different GVs . 563 564 Mass spectrometry 565 The target Cas1 protein band was excised from the electrophoresis gel and subjected 566 to in - gel digestion ( Hellman et al . , 1995 ) . The peptide fractions were analyzed by a 567 solariX ( Bruker Daltonics , Billerica , USA ) , as previously described ( Kawakita et al . , 568 2016 ) . 569 570 571 High - speed atomic force microscopy 572 We used a laboratory - built high - speed atomic force microscope ( HS - AFM ) as 573 described previously ( Ando et al . , 2008 ; Ngo et al . , 2015 ; Uchihashi et al . , 2012 ) . HS - 574 AFM imaging was carried out in solution using tapping mode with small cantilevers ( BL - 575 AC10DS - A2 , Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) whose spring constant , resonant frequency in 576 water , and quality factor in water were ∼ 0 . 1 N / m , ∼ 500 kHz , and ∼ 1 . 5 , respectively . Our 577 lab - made ferrocene tip on an original tip - less cantilever was grown through electron beam 578 deposition ( EBD ) using scanning electron microscopy ( ZEISS Supra 40 VP / Gemini 579 column , Zeiss , Germany ) . Typically , the EBD tip was grown under vacuum ( 1 – 5 x 10 - 6 580 Torr ) , aperture size ( 10 µm ) , and EHT voltage ( 20 kV ) for 30 s . The EBD ferrocene tip 581 was further sharpened using a radio frequency plasma etcher ( Tergeo Plasma Cleaner , Pie 582 Scientific , CA , USA ) under an argon gas atmosphere ( typically at 180 mTorr and 20 W 583 for 30 s ) . During HS - AFM imaging , the free - oscillation peak - to - peak amplitude of the 584 cantilever ( A 0 ) was set to ∼ 1 . 6 – 1 . 8 nm , and the feedback amplitude set - point was set at 585 ~ 0 . 9 A 0 . 586 587 Real - time imaging of disruption of lipid membranes caused by Cas1 and Cas2 588 We prepared small unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) or liposomes by the thin - film 589 hydration method and mica - supported lipid bilayer as described previously ( Ngo et al . , 590 2015 ) . In this study , DPPC , DPPC / DPPA ( 80 / 20 wt % ) , DPPC / MGDG ( 80 / 20 wt % ) , 591 DPPC / DGDG ( 60 / 40 wt % ) , DPPC / stigmasterol ( 80 / 20 wt % ) , DPPC / sitosterol ( 80 / 20 592 wt % ) , DPPC / DGTS - d9 ( 80 / 20 wt % ) , and DPPC / DGTS ( 80 / 20 wt % ) liposomes were 593 made . Typically , liposomes were made in Milli - Q water at 1 mg / ml and stored at −20 °C . 594 To form a lipid bilayer on mica , liposomes were diluted in 10 mM MgCl 2 to 0 . 1 mg / ml 595 and sonicated with a bath sonicator at room temperature ( AUC - 06 L , AS ONE , Osaka , 596 Japan ) for 1 min . Then , 2 µl of the sonicated liposomes was deposited on the surface of 597 freshly cleaved mica ( 2 mm in diameter ) , which had been glued onto a glass stage 598 beforehand , and incubated for approximately 2 h at room temperature ( 24 – 26°C ) in a 599 humid sealed container to avoid surface drying . 600 Real - time imaging of the binding and disruption activities of Cas1 and Cas2 to lipid 601 membranes formed on mica was carried out in C - buffer containing 10 mM HEPES - NaOH 602 ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , and 100 mM NaCl at room temperature by using HS - AFM . In 603 all HS - AFM experiments excepted noted , we consistently used 0 . 95 µM Cas1 or Cas2 as 604 a final concentration to examine the susceptibility of different lipid membrane 605 compositions to Cas1 and Cas2 . The sample volume in the HS - AFM imaging experiment 606 was ~ 70 µl . 607 608 Cytotoxicity on rubber leaves caused by Cas1 and Cas2 609 Young and healthy leaves of rubber trees ( H . brasiliensis RRIV 4 , RRIV 1 , and PB 610 255 clones ) grown in southern Vietnam were freshly collected in the early morning . It 611 usually took 4 – 5 h before a cytotoxicity test . The leaves were carefully disinfected with 612 60 % ethanol and sterilized Milli - Q water . Three rubber leaves were placed on a plastic 613 net under one experimental condition and separately incubated inside a plastic box ( 40 614 cm x 40 cm x 5 cm ) . The moisture was maintained by laying down wet Whatman filter 615 paper under a plastic net , avoiding direct contact with leaves . To test the cytotoxicity of 616 Cas1 and Cas2 on rubber leaves , 6 to 10 small spots on the lower lamina sides of leaves 617 were chosen and slightly scraped on the cuticle wax layer with a small pipette tip . Next , 618 10 µl of 0 . 0083 µg / µl ( ~ 0 . 083 µg ) Cas1 or Cas2 was applied to each spot . The molar 619 concentration of Cas1 and Cas2 infected in each spot was kept almost the same as that 620 used for HS - AFM observation , although the final sample volume used in HS - AFM 621 observation was ~ 7 times higher . The control experiments were performed similarly by 622 applying 10 µl of sterilized Milli - Q water to each spot . The control and infected leaf 623 samples were separately incubated and maintained under the same humidity ( ~ 80 – 90 % ) 624 and temperature ( ~ 26 – 28°C ) in the dark . For sample analyses , leaves in each moist 625 plastic box were carefully photographed after 24 , 72 , and 120 h of infection by using a 626 conventional digital camera . Each experimental condition was repeated 2 – 3 times . The 627 leaf lesion spots caused by Cas1 and Cas2 on different rubber clones were compared by 628 observing color changes and lesion size and dissecting the cellular structures by cryo - 629 SEM . 630 Pathogenicity test on rubber leaves with C . cassiicola : Healthy rubber leaves ( RRIV 631 4 clone ) were washed with 0 . 2 % sodium benzoate for 30 seconds , then followed by 632 rinsing three times with sterile distilled water . After draining the leaves with sterile paper , 633 rubber leaves were put up side down on the wire mesh in plastic containers in order to 634 separate the leaves and moisture absorbent paper . The infection on rubber detached leaves 635 was conducted by dropping 10 μ l of Corynespora cassiicola conidial solution with the 636 concentration of 2x10 3 spores / ml at 8 points per leaf using micro pipette . Next , the plastic 637 containers were placed in a room at 25°C and humidity ( 80 – 90 % ) under 12 hours of 638 fluorescent light per day within six days . The pathogenicity of C . cassiicola was evaluated 639 and recorded based on the modified method by Nghia et al . , 2008 . 640 641 Cryo - SEM imaging 642 We selected the healthy ( control , + water , 120 h ) and infected ( + Cas1 , 120 h ) leaves 643 of one rubber clone ( RRIV 4 ) to anatomize the leaf tissues and cellular structures . To 644 make the Cryo - SEM samples , healthy and lesion - containing areas surrounding the 645 initially scraped spots were chosen . The ultrastructures of leaf tissues were analyzed by 646 low voltage cryo - scanning electron microscopy ( Cryo - SEM ) , a powerful technique for 647 imaging pristinely fractured biological cells without conductive metal coating ( Osumi et 648 al . , 2006 ) . Leaf samples were punched out with a 3 mm diameter circular blade and 649 plunged into liquid ethane at 90 K . Cryo - SEM images were obtained from a Helios G4 650 CX ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , USA ) with a PP3010 Cryo - SEM transfer system ( Quorum 651 Technologies , UK ) . Frozen leaf samples were clamped perpendicular at the top and the 652 center of a metal cylinder on the transfer shuttle and fractured inside the vacuum chamber 653 to face the freshly fractured depth profile just on the top of the cylinder without 654 conductive metal coating . No ice contamination growth was visible during the fracture of 655 samples under high vacuum conditions below a pressure of 5 . 0 x 10 - 5 Pa . The sample 656 stage temperature was kept at 93 K . A 1 kV electron beam of the landing energy with a 657 stage bias voltage of 2 kV was used substantially in low voltage cryo - SEM imaging of 658 the fractured sample surfaces embedded in a cylindrical shape holder . Notably , only when 659 the lower lamina side of rubber leaves was imaged we coated the leaf surface with 660 platinum in the vacuum chamber before imaging . 661 662 Analyses of HS - AFM images 663 HS - AFM images were viewed , analyzed , and exported by using the laboratory built 664 software Kodec4 . 4 . 7 . 39 . Kodec4 . 4 . 7 . 39 software was coded in Visual C # ( Visual Studio 665 2010 , Microsoft , USA ) , and source code 1 is openly available ( Ngo et al . , 2015 ) . All 666 filters and subroutines for image analyses used in the present study were included in the 667 software . We confirmed the compatibility between the software and computers operated 668 with Windows 8 or 10 .

Briefly , 670 AFM images were flattened and filtered ( Gaussian blur , Sigma radius : 1 nm ) to increase 671 the S / N ratio . AFM images were converted and extracted to BMP format images .
