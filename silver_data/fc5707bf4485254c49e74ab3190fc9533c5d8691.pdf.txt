Redner Center for Polymer Studies and Department of Physics , Boston University , Boston , MA , 02215 Numerical data for the distribution of citations are examined for : ( i ) papers published in 1981 in journals which are catalogued by the Institute for Scientiﬁc Information ( 783 , 339 papers ) and ( ii ) 20 years of publications in Physical Review D , vols . 11 - 50 ( 24 , 296 papers ) . A Zipf plot of the number of citations to a given paper versus its citation rank appears to be consistent with a power - law dependence for leading rank papers , with exponent close to − 1 / 2 . This , in turn , suggests that the number of papers with x citations , N ( x ) , has a large - x power law decay N ( x ) ∼ x − α , with α ≈ 3 .

Namely , how often is a paper cited ? While the average or total num - ber of citations are often quoted anecdotally and tab - ulations of highly - cited papers exist [ 1 , 2 ] , the focus of this work is on the more fundamental distribution of ci - tations , namely , the number of papers which have been cited a total of x times , N ( x ) . In spite of the fact that many academics are obliged to document their citations for merit - based considerations , there have been only a few scientiﬁc investigations on quantifying citations or re - lated measures of scientiﬁc productivity . In a 1957 study based on the publication record of the scientiﬁc research staﬀ at Brookhaven National Laboratory , Shockley [ 3 ] claimed that the scientiﬁc publication rate is described by a log - normal distribution . Much more recently , La - herrere and Sornette [ 4 ] have presented numerical evi - dence , based on data of the 1120 most - cited physicists from 1981 through June 1997 , that the citation distri - bution of individual authors has a stretched exponential form , N ( x ) ∝ exp [ − ( x / x 0 ) β ] with β ≈ 0 . 3 . Both papers give qualitative justiﬁcations for their assertions which are based on plausible general principles ; however , these arguments do not provide speciﬁc numerical predictions . Here , the citation distribution of scientiﬁc publications based on two relatively large data sets is investigated [ 5 ] . One ( ISI ) is the citation distribution of 783 , 339 papers ( with 6 , 716 , 198 citations ) published in 1981 and cited be - tween 1981 – June 1997 that have been cataloged by the Institute for Scientiﬁc Information . The second ( PRD ) is the citation distribution , as of June 1997 , of the 24 , 296 papers cited at least once ( with 351 , 872 citations ) which were published in volumes 11 through 50 of Physical Re - view D , 1975 – 1994 . Unlike Ref . [ 4 ] , the focus here is on citations of publications rather than citations of speciﬁc authors . A primary reason for this emphasis is that the publication citation count reﬂects on the publication it - self , while the author citation count reﬂects ancillary fea - tures , such as the total number of author publications , the quality of each of these publications , and co - author attributes . Additionally , only most - cited author data is currently available ; this permits reconstruction of just the large - citation tail of the citation distribution . 0 2 4 6 8 ln x 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 l n N ( x ) ( a ) 0 200 400 600 x 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 l n N ( x ) ( b ) FIG . 1 .

For visual refer - ence , a straight line of slope − 3 is also shown . ( b ) Same as ( a ) , except on a semi - logarithmic scale . The solid curves are the best ﬁts to the data for x ≤ 200 ( PRD ) and x ≤ 500 ( ISI ) The main result of this study is that the asymptotic 1 tail of the citation distribution appears to be described by a power law , N ( x ) ∼ x − α , with α ≈ 3 . This con - clusion is reached indirectly by means of a Zipf plot ( to be deﬁned and discussed below ) , however , because Fig . 1 indicates that the citation distribution is not described by a single function over the whole range of x . Since the distribution curves downward on a double logarithmic scale and upward on a semi - logarithmic scale ( Figs . 1 ( a ) and ( b ) respectively ) , a natural ﬁrst hypoth - esis is that this distribution is a stretched exponential , N ( x ) ∝ exp [ − ( x / x 0 ) β ] . Visually , the numerical data ﬁt this form fairly well for x ≤ 200 ( PRD ) and x ≤ 500 ( ISI ) as indicated in Fig . 1 ( b ) , with best ﬁt values β ≈ 0 . 39 ( PRD ) and β ≈ 0 . 44 ( ISI ) . However , the stretched expo - nential is unsuitable to describe the large - x data . Here , data points are widely scattered , reﬂecting the paucity of well - cited papers . For example , in the ISI data , only 64 out of 783 , 339 papers are cited more than 1000 times , 282 papers are cited more than 500 times , and 2103 papers are cited more than 200 times , with the most - cited paper having 8907 citations . Such a sparsely populated tail is not amenable to being directly ﬁt by a smooth function . ( Amusingly ( or soberingly ) 633 , 391 articles in the ISI set are cited 10 times or less and 368 , 110 are uncited . ) Another test to determine the functional form of N ( x ) is to compare numerical values for the moments of the citation distribution h x k i = R x k N ( x ) dx R N ( x ) dx , ( 1 ) with those obtained by assuming a given form for N ( x ) . For example , if the citation distribution is a stretched exponential , then the dimensionless ratios M k ≡ h x k i / h x i k = Γ ( k + 1 β ) Γ ( 1 β ) k − 1 / Γ ( 2 β ) k , where Γ ( x ) is the gamma function . Notice that the scale factor x 0 in the exponential cancels . For each k , an estimate for β can be inferred by matching the value of M k obtained from the above gamma function formula with the correspond - ing numerical data . For both the ISI and PRD data , the corresponding estimates for β for k = 2 , 3 , . . . , 6 de - pend weakly but non - systematically on k , and further do not match the values for β obtained from a least - squares ﬁt to a stretched exponential ( Fig . 1 ( b ) ) . Similarly , the numerical data for h x k i also do not match a power - law form for the citation distribution , N ( x ) ∼ x − α . These results provide evidence that the citation distribution is not described by a single function over the entire range of citation count . More fundamentally , it is natural to expect diﬀerent underlying mechanisms and diﬀerent statistical features between minimally - cited and heavily - cited papers . The former are typically referenced by the author and close associates , and such papers are typically forgotten a short time after publication . Evidence for such a short lifetime of minimally - cited papers can be found , e . g . , by compar - ing the small - citation tail of N ( x ) for the ﬁrst 4 years ( 1975 - 79 ) and the last 4 years ( 1990 - 1994 ) of the PRD data set . For x < ∼ 200 , these data ( appropriately normal - ized ) and the complete PRD data are virtually identi - cal . On the other hand , well - cited papers become known through collective eﬀects and their impact also extends over long time periods . This is reﬂected in the signif - icant diﬀerences among the large - citation tails of N ( x ) for papers of diﬀerent eras . To help expose these diﬀerences in the citation distri - bution , it is useful to construct a Zipf plot [ 6 ] , in which the number of citations of the k th most - ranked paper out of an ensemble of M papers is plotted versus rank k ( Fig . 2 ) . By its very deﬁnition ( see Eq . ( 2 ) ) , the Zipf plot is closely related to the cumulative large - x tail of the ci - tation distribution . This plot is therefore well - suited for determining the large - x tail of the citation distribution . The integral nature of the Zipf plot also smooths the ﬂuctuations in the high - citation tail and thus facilitates quantitative analysis . Given an ensemble of M publications and the corre - sponding number of citations for each of these papers in rank order , Y 1 ≥ Y 2 ≥ . . . ≥ Y M , then the number of ci - tations of the k th most - cited paper , Y k , may be estimated by the criterion [ 7 ] Z ∞ Y k N ( x ) dx = k . ( 2 ) This speciﬁes that there are k publications out of the en - semble of M which are cited at least Y k times . Eq . ( 2 ) also represents a one - to - one correspondence between the Zipf plot and the citation distribution . From the depen - dence of Y k on k in a Zipf plot , one can test whether it accords with a hypothesized form for N ( x ) . In Fig . 2 ( a ) , a Zipf plot of the rank - ordered citation data is presented on a double logarithmic scale for 4 data sets : ( a ) ISI data ( top 200 , 000 papers only ) , ( b ) complete PRD data ( 24 , 296 papers ) , ( c ) ﬁrst 4 years of PRD data , vols . 11 - 18 ( 5044 papers ) , and ( d ) last 4 years of PRD data , vols . 43 - 50 ( 5467 papers ) . As alluded to previously , there is a considerable diﬀerence between the ﬁrst and last 4 years of the PRD data . As might be anticipated , the more recent highly - cited papers ( up to approximately rank 700 ) are cited less than papers in the earlier sub - data . ( There are two exceptions , however . These are the two top papers in the ﬁrst 4 years which are cited 1741 and 1294 times , while in the last 4 years of data the two leading papers are cited 2026 and 1420 times . ) The larger citation count of heavily - cited older papers reﬂects the obvious fact that popular but recent PRD papers are still relatively early in their citation history . This is in sharp contrast to poorly - cited papers where there is little diﬀerence in the citation count from the ﬁrst 4 years and the last 4 years of the PRD data . 2 0 5 10 15 ln k 0 2 4 6 8 10 l n Y k ( a ) −15 −10 −5 0 ln k / M −2 0 2 4 6 8 l n ( Y k / 〈 x 〉 ) ( b ) FIG . 2 .

For visual reference , a straight line of slope − 1 / 2 is also shown . To interpret the apparently unsystematic data in the Zipf plot of Fig . 2 ( a ) eﬀectively , it is instructive to scale the data . Since k ranges between 1 and the number of publications in the ensemble , it is natural to deﬁne a scaled relative rank k / M i , where M i is the total number of papers in each of the 4 data sets in Fig . 2 , ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 ) . Similarly , for the ordinate , it is useful to deﬁne a scaled citation count for the k th most - cited paper by Y k / h x i i , where h x i i is the average number of citations for all papers in the i th data set . As shown in Fig . 2 ( b ) , there is relatively good collapse of the 4 data sets onto a single universal curve . Notice also that the disparity in the two PRD data subsets appears as a relatively small ﬂuctua - tion about a mean value . The data collapse also provides a strong clue about the location of the asymptotic regime for citation data . Of particular relevance for the citation distribution , this scaling plot indicates that the ISI data extends deeper than the PRD data into the asymptotic tail of most heavily - cited papers . This arises both from the fact that the ISI data involves approximately 30 times more publications than the PRD data and that the av - erage number of citations to ISI papers is approximately one - half that of PRD papers . From the available data , the highly - ranked ISI publications therefore provide the best representation of the asymptotic tail of the citation distribution . For ISI publications between rank 1 ( 8904 citations ) and 12 , 000 ( approximately 85 citations ) , the data is fairly linear and a least - squares data ﬁt in this range yields an exponent for the Zipf plot of Fig . 2 ( b ) of approximately − 0 . 48 . By inverting Eq . ( 2 ) , this power law is equivalent to the distribution of citations also hav - ing a power law form N ( x ) ∝ x − α for large x , with α = 1 + 1 / . 48 ≈ 3 . 08 . This power - law behavior suggests a reconsideration of the citation distribution in this range of ≥ 85 citations ( Fig . 1 ( a ) ) . The curvature in the data decreases signiﬁ - cantly for x ≥ 85 and it is not unreasonable to attempt a power law ﬁt , but with the additional caveat that the citation data beyond approximately 500 citations is dom - inated by ﬂuctuations . Consequently there is subjectivity in specifying the range over which this ﬁt is performed . Least - squares ﬁts to the data within 50 ≤ x ≤ 1000 give exponent estimates in the range 2 . 6 – 2 . 8 , and a ﬁt for 85 ≤ x ≤ 500 , where the data are visually the most lin - ear , both in the citation distribution and in the Zipf plot , gives α ≈ − 2 . 7 . The correspondence between these ﬁts and those in the Zipf plot therefore suggest that the cita - tion distribution may have a power - law tail , N ( x ) ∼ x − α , with exponent α close to 3 .

This feature is nicely illustrated by the annual ci - tation statistics of PRD publications , where the average number of citations h x i for articles published in a given year is typically decreasing slowly with time ( Table 1 ) . It is interesting that the existence of a single exceptionally well - cited paper in a particular year has an imperceptible eﬀect on h x i but a much larger inﬂuence on higher - order moments . Notice also that the total number of citations to PRD papers published in a given year , even as far back as 1975 ( the ﬁrst year for which data is available ) , is slowly increasing . Since papers from this period which are still currently being cited are also likely to be highly cited , this implies that the large - x tail of the citation dis - tribution has not yet reached its ﬁnal state . Because of this continuing evolution of the citation distribution , one cannot expect that the properties of the high - citation tail of the citation distribution will be accurately determined by direct analysis . In summary , the citation distribution provides basic insights about the relative popularity of scientiﬁc pub - lications and provides a much more complete measure of popularity than the average or total number of cita - tions . At a basic level , most publications are minimally recognized , with ≈ 47 % of the papers in the ISI data set uncited , more than 80 % cited 10 times or less , and ≈ . 01 % cited more than 1000 times . The distribution of citations is a rapidly decreasing function of citation count but does not appear to be described by a single function over the entire range of this variable . Although the available data is extensive , it still appears insuﬃcient to quantify the tail of the citation distribution unam - biguously by direct means . However , a Zipf plot of the citation count of a given paper versus its citation rank indicates a substantial range of power law behavior with exponent close to − 1 / 2 . This provides indirect evidence that the citation distribution has a power law asymp - totic tail , N ( x ) ∼ x − α with α ≈ 3 . This diﬀers from the conclusion of Ref . [ 4 ] , where the citation distribution of individual authors was argued to have a stretched expo - nential tail . Another important aspect of citations is that comput - erized data are relatively recent , and the PRD data in - dicates that citation statistics from 1975 are still evolv - ing . Thus even the more extensive ISI data set is still too recent to provide an accurate picture of the long - time and large - citation tail of the citation distribution . It should therefore be worthwhile to study the proper - ties of older citation data . Alternatively , information of a related genre , such as the distribution of sales for a particular class of books , or ticket sales for movies and theaters may provide useful data for studying citation - related statistics . Finally , the citation distribution provides an appealing venue for theoretical modeling . There are several quali - tative features about citations which should be essential ingredients for a theory of their distribution . Since al - most all papers are gradually forgotten , the probability that a given paper is cited should decrease in time with a relatively short memory . Conversely , a paper which is in the process of becoming recognized gains increasing attention through citations . This suggests that the prob - ability of a paper being cited at a given time should be an increasing function of the relative number of citations to that paper from an earlier time period . Work is in progress to construct a model for the citation distribu - tion which is based on these considerations . I thank P . Krapivsky , F . Leyvraz , and D . Sornette for helpful discussions , P .
