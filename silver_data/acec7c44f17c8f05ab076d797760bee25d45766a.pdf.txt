Summary of key scientific evidence for teamwork processes & team effectiveness Core team processes Key citations Meta - analytic evidence Team knowledge • Information sharing : Team decision - making that involves communicating information known to all ( common ) and information specific to expertise ( unique ) , such that the combined information set can contribute to an effective decision . Mesmer - Magnus & DeChurch ( 2009 ) ; Lu et al . ( 2012 ) Information sharing is significantly related to team performance overall ( ρ = . 42 ) and is particularly important for team performance ( ρ = . 50 ) and decision - making ( ρ = . 47 ) if the combination of unique information is required . In tasks where team members have both common and unique information that need to be combined for optimal decisions , team members share common information two standard deviations more than unique information and , as a result , they are eight times less likely to make the correct decision compared to teams with full access to all the information . • Team cognition : Mental models and transactive memory . Mental models represent shared , organized information held collectively across the team . Transactive memory represents distinct , distributed knowledge connected by a shared understanding of who knows what . DeChurch & Mesmer - Magnus ( 2010 ) Team cognition is related to team behavioral processes ( ρ = . 43 ) , motivational states ( ρ = . 43 ) , and performance ( ρ = . 38 ) . Transactive memory is more strongly related to team performance ( ρ = . 44 ) compared with shared team mental models ( ρ = . 32 ) . Adaptation • Team goals : Goals that are difficult , specific , and collectively held direct attention , task strategies , and effort expenditure . Kleingeld et al . ( 2011 ) ; O’Leary - Kelly et al . ( 1994 ) Twenty - six effect sizes from 10 studies indicate that compared with no goals or low goals , group - level goals exert an increase of one standard deviation in group performance . Seventy - six independent effect sizes from 30 studies indicate a relationship between group - level goals and group performance ( d = 0 . 56 + 0 . 19 , k = 49 ) that was stronger when group goals were more difficult and specific ( compared with nonspecific goals ; d = 0 . 80 + 0 . 35 , k = 23 ) . • Mechanisms : Team process behaviors that contribute to team adaptation . Christian et al . ( 2017 ) Team behavior is positively related to team adaptive performance ( ρ = . 34 ) , specific relevant behaviors are communication ( ρ = . 22 ) , coordination ( ρ = . 30 ) , stimulus specific actions ( ρ = . 41 ) , learning behavior ( ρ = . 27 ) , and plan formulation ( ρ = . 24 ) . Team cognition is positively related to team adaptive performance ( ρ = . 19 ) ; in particular , mental models ( ρ = . 13 ) and transactive memory ( ρ = . 30 ) are important . Motivation • Team cohesion : Shared attraction that bonds members socially to the team and its tasks . Beal et al . ( 2003 ) ; Gully et al . ( 1995 ) Group - level cohesion is significantly related to group performance ( 33 effect sizes ; ρ = . 317 ) ; task interdependence moderated this relationship such that cohesion is more strongly associated with team performance when task interdependence is high ( ρ = . 464 ) versus low ( ρ = . 206 ) . The moderating effect of task interdependence was later replicated , R 2 = . 096 , F ( 1 , 52 ) = 5 . 430 , p < . 05 . • Team efficacy : A shared belief that the team can collectively overcome uncertainties , difficulties , and challenges . Gully et al . ( 2002 ) There is a significant relationship between team efficacy and team performance ( ρ = . 41 ) that is moderated by task interdependence ( i . e . , low , ρ = . 09 , versus high , ρ = . 47 ) . a publication of the behavioral science & policy association 3 Table S2 . Summary of key scientific evidence for interventions that support team effectiveness Interventions Key citations Meta - analytic & research evidence Team training Salas et al . ( 2008 ) Lacerenza et al . ( 2017 ) McEwan et al . ( 2017 ) Keiser & Arthur ( 2021 ) Meta - analysis that indicated that team training improves team cognition ( ρ = . 42 ) , affect ( ρ = . 35 ) , process ( ρ = . 44 ) , and performance ( ρ = . 39 ) . Meta - analysis based on effect sizes from 335 independent studies that indicated that leadership training is effective at improving reactions ( δ = . 63 ; 95 % CI [ . 12 , 1 . 15 ] ) , learning ( δ = . 73 ; 95 % CI [ . 62 , . 85 ] ) , transfer ( δ = . 82 ; 95 % CI [ . 58 , 1 . 06 ] ) , and results ( δ = . 72 ; 95 % CI [ . 60 , . 84 ] ) . Meta - analysis conducted on 51 articles , comprising 72 ( k ) unique experimental training interventions , 194 effect sizes , and 8 , 439 participants , which indicated that training had a ( significant ) medium to large effect on teamwork , d ( 0 . 13 ) = 0 . 683 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 43 , 0 . 94 ] , Z = 5 . 23 , p < . 001 ; Q ( 38 ) = 660 . 7 , I 2 = 94 . 2 . Meta - analysis conducted on 61 articles reporting overall 107 effect sizes for after - action reviews as a training intervention used in overall 915 teams with 3 , 499 participants , which indicated that after - action reviews had sample weighted mean d = 0 . 79 , SD = 0 . 83 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 63 , 0 . 95 ] , across attitude , cognitive , process , and performance effects . Work design Humphrey et al . ( 2007 ) Meta - analysis based on nine independent samples that indicated that autonomy is related to objective job performance ( ρ = . 17 ) ; based on up to 42 independent samples , there are significant relationships between subjective performance and autonomy ( ρ = . 23 ) , task identity ( ρ = . 17 ) , task significance ( ρ = . 23 ) , and feedback ( ρ = . 20 ) . Climate Carr et al . ( 2003 ) Parker et al . ( 2003 ) Meta - analytic path analysis that indicated that climate significantly influenced outcomes of job performance , psychological well - being , and withdrawal ; the influence of climate operated through perceptions of organizational commitment and job satisfaction . Meta - analytic structural equation modeling that indicated that psychological climate perceptions were significantly related to work attitudes , psychological well - being , motivation , and performance .

In the United States , fatal aircraft accidents have continuously decreased since the federal mandate to introduce team training for flight crews in civil aviation ( Flight Safety Foundation , 2019 ) . Medicine In medicine , teamwork errors have high costs in human life ( James , 2013 ; Kohn et al . , 2000 ) . Indeed , medical errors are the third leading cause of death and may exceed 250 , 000 deaths per year ( Makary & Daniel , 2016 ) . As in aviation , most of those human errors have their roots in poor teamwork ( The Joint Commission , 2016 ; Tomlinson & Wakeling , 2019 ) . Industry & Organizations Many industrial accidents with significant loss of life and environmental damage have been attributed to human error and poor teamwork , including the nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union ; the toxic chemical release at Bhopal , India ; and the Deepwater Horizon explosion and massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
