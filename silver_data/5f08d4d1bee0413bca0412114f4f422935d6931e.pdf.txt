LETTER doi : 10 . 1038 / nature09372 Direct visualization of secondary structures of F - actin by electron cryomicroscopy Takashi Fujii 1 , Atsuko H . Iwane 1 , Toshio Yanagida 1 & Keiichi Namba 1 F - actin is a helical assembly of actin , which is a component of muscle fibres essential for contraction and has a crucial role in numerous cellular processes , such as the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia 1 , 2 , as the most abundant component and regulator of cytoskeletons by dynamic assembly and disassembly ( from G - actin to F - actin and vice versa ) . Actin is a ubiquitous protein and is involved in important biological functions , but the definitive high - resolution structure of F - actin remains unknown . Although a recent atomic model well reproduced X - ray fibre diffraction intensity data from a highly oriented liquid - crystalline sol spe - cimen 3 , its refinement without experimental phase information has certain limitations . Direct visualization of the structure by electron cryomicroscopy , however , has been difficult because it is relatively thin and flexible . Here we report the F - actin structure at 6 . 6 Å resolution , made obtainable by recent advances in electron cryomicroscopy . The density map clearly resolves all the secondary structures of G - actin , such as a - helices , b - structures and loops , and makes unambiguous modelling and refinement possible . Complex domain motions that open the nucleotide - binding pocket on F - actin formation , specific D - loop and terminal conformations , and relatively tight axial but markedly loose interprotofilament interactions hydrophilic in nature are revealed in the F - actin model , and all seemto be important for dynamic functions ofactin . Many of the atomic models of F - actin proposed over the years 3 – 5 were obtainedbymaximizingtheagreementbetween experimentalintensities of X - ray fibre diffraction and those calculated from a model . However , because the diffraction patterns are cylindrically averaged and layer lines are broadened in an arc owing to the finite disorientation , it is extremely difficult to obtain individual Fourier – Bessel components of the structure factors for three - dimensional ( 3D ) density reconstruction . That is why these analyses have been done by building many models , calculating layer - line intensities and maximizing the agreement between observed andcalculatedintensitiestofindabestpossiblemodel , exceptinonecase withtobaccomosaicvirus 6 . Therefore , thereisalwayssomeconcernasto whether or not such models are unique . Technical advances in the electron cryomicroscopy ( cryoEM ) and image analysis of frozen hydrated specimens in recent years have allowed the structural analysis of helical assemblies of biological macromolecules , suchasthebacterialflagellarfilament , atnear - atomic resolution by aligning and averaging tens of thousands of molecular images using helical symmetry 7 – 9 . CryoEM image analyses of F - actin have also been carried out but only up to 13Å resolution 3 , 5 , 10 , so the atomic model is of limited accuracy in studying the mechanisms of actin polymerization and depolymerization . Because F - actin is a flex - ible , ribbon - like filament with a diameter of 100Å and a mass - per - lengthof1 . 5kDa Å 2 1 , theimagecontrastoffrozenhydratedspeci - mens is markedly lower than that of thicker tubular structures of the flagellar filament ( 230 Å , 11 . 0 kDaÅ 2 1 ) and tobacco mosaic virus ( 180 Å , 12 . 6kDaÅ 2 1 ) , making accurate image alignment and high - resolution analysis extremely difficult . However , recent technical advances 11 have allowed us to obtain a 3D density map of skeletal muscle F - actin at 6 . 6 Å resolution . Key to this is our use of an in - column V - type energy filter and charge - couple - device ( CCD ) camera as well as a field - emission gun andaliquid - helium - cooledspecimenstage . Aremarkable , 5 - foldgain in contrast has been achieved by energy filtering , controlling ice thick - ness and using a specimen temperature of 50K instead of 4K ( ref . 11 ) . We can now see the two - stranded helical features of F - actin even at small defocus levels ( Fig . 1a ) . The CCD camera made the collections of high - qualityimagesfarmoreefficient , buttoavoidundesirableremoval of high - resolution contrast by its poor modulation transfer function 12 we used a magnification of 172 , 000 3 ( 0 . 87 Å per pixel ) . We collected 490 such high - quality images in two days . We used a single - particle image analysis method using helical symmetry 11 , 13 . Because we fully automated the whole procedure including corrections for the contrast transfer function , the image analysis was completed within two days . The helical symmetry and the axial repeat distance were refined in the iterative process of image analysis and converged to a subunit rotation of 2 166 . 6 u , corresponding to a helical symmetry of between 28 / 13 and 13 / 6 ( subunits / turn ) , and an axial repeat of 27 . 6Å . The resolution was 6 . 6 Å at a Fourier shell correlation of 0 . 143 ( ref . 14 ; Supplementary Figs 1and2 ) . Layerlinesarevisibleoutto6 . 8Åinthepowerspectrumofthe 3Dreconstruction ( Fig . 1b ; seealsoSupplementaryFig . 3 ) . Thevariance map shows the reliability of the density map as well as the rigid helical backbone of the filament ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Because the resolution was better than that needed to identify indi - vidual secondary structures of actin , including loops and an extended amino - terminal chain previously unresolved in the crystal structure ( Fig . 2 and Supplementary Movie 1 ) , we were able to build a highly reliable atomic model of F - actin . The situation is analogous to protein crystallography at 3 Å resolution , where side chains can be identified and used to build a reliable atomic model . Although the flexibility of F - actin , especially in its helical order , has been debated over the years 10 , the high - resolution map obtained by using over 97 % of the collected images indicates that F - actin is not so flexible . Multireference align - ment with reference 3D volumes of F - actin with different helical sym - metries produced a narrow angular distribution ( Fig . 1c ) , indicating that the twisting variability by thermal motion is less than , 1 u . This alsodemonstratestheimportanceofcarefulcryospecimenpreparationwithanautomatedvitrificationdevice ( Methods ) . To build a reliable atomic model of F - actin , we used FlexEM 15 , which refines the atomic model by fitting it into the electron micro - scopy map by simulated annealing molecular dynamics with stereo - chemical and non - bonded interaction terms restrained . We used the crystal structure of uncomplexed actin 16 ( Protein Data Bank ID , 1J6Z ) as the model representing G - actin and divided it into four domains ( Fig . 3 ) , whichhave been conventionallynamedsubdomains 17 . We call them domains because domains 1 , 3 and 4 have well - defined hydro - phobic cores and behave as rigid , independent units on conforma - tional change from G - actin 16 to F - actin ( Fig . 3a ) , as indicated by the small root - mean - squared displacements of C a atoms ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . This in turn ensures the correctness and reliability of the present F - actin model . The model and the refinement process are shown in Fig . 2 and Supplementary Movie 2 , respectively . 1 GraduateSchoolofFrontierBiosciences , OsakaUniversity , 1 - 3Yamadaoka , Suita , Osaka565 - 0871 , Japan . 7 2 4 | N AT U R E | V O L 4 6 7 | 7 O C T O B E R 2 0 1 0 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved ©2010 Domain 2 is the only exception . The two - turn a - helix ( residues 40 – 48 ) at the tip of the D - loop ( the DNase - I - binding loop 17 ) of G - actin 16 becomes an extended loop ( 38 – 53 ) ( Fig . 3a , upper right ) . Although such a change has been predicted from its variable conformation in crystal structures and its possible involvement in the axial intersubunit interactions , this D - loop conformation is unique , indicating that it is totally dependent on the molecule to which it binds ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Although the overall conformation of F - actin is similar to the pre - vious ones 3 , 5 , our model shows distinct features in local conformation , such as loops and terminal chains ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Even the positions of main - chain atoms are distinctly different , as indicated by the root - mean - squared deviations in the positions of corresponding C a atoms ( Supplementary Fig . 7 and Supplementary Table 2 ) . Because the nature of the conformational change from G - actin to F - actin is of immense importance for the biological implications of actin function , we carefully compared the F - actin structure with that of G - actin 16 . Whereas the two major domains ( domains 1 – 2 and 3 – 4 ) are twisted in G - actin , they become flat in F - actin . However , the relative domain motions are more complex than those described previously 3 . When domain 1 is superposed , domain 2 is tilted towards domain 4 by 10 u and towards the outside of F - actin ( out of the page in Fig . 3b ) by 20 u around the red ‘spear’ ( Fig . 3b , c , red arrow ) . Together with the con - formational change in the D - loop , the slightly bent domain 1 – 2 in G - actin becomes significantly flatter in F - actin ( Fig . 3c ) . When domain 3 is superposed , domain 4 is tilted towards the inside of F - actin ( into the page in Fig . 3d ) by 7 u around the blue spear ( Fig . 3d , e , blue arrows ) , making the slightly bent domain 3 – 4 in G - actin flatter in F - actin . At the same time , domain 1 is rotated relative to domain 3 by 13 u ( Fig . 3f , green arrows ) around the green spear passing diagonally through domain 4 to the outside of domain 1 ( Fig . 3d , f ) . 166 . 6 165 . 6 167 . 6 164 . 6 168 . 6 163 . 6 169 . 6 Rotation per subunit ( º ) N u m b e r o f s e g m e n t i m a g e s 1 , 000 2 , 000 3 , 000 6 . 8 Å a b c Figure 1 | High - contrast cryoEM image of F - actin , its power spectrum and angular distribution of rotation per subunit . a , A CCD frame of frozen hydrated F - actin filaments embedded in vitreous ice film recorded by zero - loss energy - filtered microscopy .

Eighty - seven per cent of all image segments were classified within 6 1 u . The angular distribution clearly shows that the twisting variability of F - actin by thermal motion is less than , 1 u .

All rights reserved ©2010 Although we cannot discuss side - chain conformations and their interactionsindetailowing tothe limited resolution , reasonablyaccur - ate main - chain positions allow us to look into possible side - chain interactions within and between actin molecules . The domain - 1 rota - tion described above also involves a 5 u anticlockwise rotation around the nucleotide within the plain of actin to open the nucleotide - binding pocket as well as the gap between domains 1 and 3 ( Fig . 3d ) . This rotation causes Gln137 to move closer to the position of the c - phos - phate . Because actin ATPase is activated on F - actin formation 18 , and because Gln137 is crucial in ATP hydrolysis 19 , our model offers a possible explanation for the ATPase activation mechanism . Axial interactions along the protofilament are tight ( Figs 2 and 4a , b ) . Subunits in Fig . 4 are numbered 2 2 , 2 1 , 0 , 1 and 2 along the 1 - start helix from the barbed - end side . Domains and residues mentioned hereafter will be those of subunit 0 unless otherwise specified . In each pair of interacting residues described below , the first residue is always ofsubunit0 . Axialinteractions areextensivebutnottotheextentofthe previous model 3 . The difference is partly due to the distinct D - loop conformation ; residues Gly46 – Leu50 of the D - loop are not associated with subunit 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . However , the D - loop still extends into the bottom pocket formed by domains 1 and 3 of subunit 2 : Val45 – Tyr143intheinteractionwithdomain1andHis40 – Tyr169 with domain 3 . The remainingpart ofdomain2 also forms a fewbonds with domain 3 of subunit 2 : Ile 64 – Tyr166 , Lys61 – Glu167 and Arg62 – Asp288 . Domain 4 is also in close contact with domain 3 of subunit 2 , forming a few bonds : Glu205 – Asp286 , Asp244 – Arg 290 , Asp241 – Thr324 and Gly245 – Pro322 . Therefore , the axial interac - tions are mostly electrostatic and hydrophilic , although there are some hydrophobic interactions . In contrast , interprotofilamentinteractions aresurprisingly modest , with only two points of contact ( Figs 2 and 4c – f ) . One is between the plug ( Gln 263 – Gly273 ) in domain 3 and the beginning of the D - loop of subunit 2 1 : Glu270 – Arg39 , Ser265 – His 40 and Gly268 – His 40 . The main - chain oxygen of Ile267 at the top of this plug may also form a bondwith His173indomain3 ofsubunit 1 . Thisplug has been called ‘hydrophobic plug’ because it was modified to an extended hairpin for hydrophobic interactions with the opposite strand 4 . However , the plug conformation is preserved in F - actin ( Fig . 2 , two actin subunits on the top right ) , and because the plug forms a salt bridge and hydrophilic interactions with subunits 2 1 and 1 to stabilize the two - stranded F - actin structure ( Fig . 4d ) , it should be called ‘hydrophilic plug’ . The other interprotofilament contact is just above the plug , where domain 4 is in contact with domains 1 and 3 of subunit 1 ( Fig . 4c – f ) . Lys191 and Thr194 in domain 4 are in close proximity to Leu110 in domain 1 and Arg177 in domain 3 of subunit 1 ( Fig . 4f ) . Glu195 in domain 4 is located where it might form a salt bridge with Lys113 in domain 1 of subunit 1 ( Fig . 4f ) . The main - chain oxygen atoms of Thr194 and Glu195 in domain 4 seem to form hydrogen bonds with the main - chain oxygen of Leu110 of subunit 1 , either directly or indirectly through water molecules , because a strong density is observed here . Taken together , the interactions between actin subunits are mostly electrostatic or hydrophilic . This explains F - actin depolymerization in concentrated salt solutions 20 . However , F - actin is not fragile , because a number of electrostatic and hydrophilic bonds can make a protein stable in a similar manner to hydrophobic ones . In the previous model , the concatenation of salt bridges between the major domains was thought to be responsible for stabilizing the flat actin conformation 3 , but our model does not show such extensive salt bridges . However , the disruption of hydrophobic interactions between domain1 ( Pro109andLeu110 ) and domain3 ( Val163andIle 175 ) by the rotation of domain 1 relative to domain 3 by 20 u ( Fig . 3d ) is consistently observed , although this rotation is nearly within the plane of actin ( Fig . 3f ) rather than untwisting the plane ( Fig . 3d , f ) . The disruption of the hydrophobic interactions puts actin into a higher - energy conformation , but it is possibly balanced by the interactions between actin subunits to make F - actin a dynamic molecular assembly with polymerization / depolymerization for cellularactivities . Thecom - plex domain motions are likely to be key to the asymmetric asso - ciation / dissociation rate of ATP – actin for steady - state treadmill - like dynamics 21 . The N - terminal chain conformation is distinct from any previous models of actin ( Fig . 2 ) . Because the negatively charged N - terminal residues ( Asp - Glu - Asp - Glu ) are important for interactions with many actin - bindingproteins , includingmyosin for musclecontraction 22 , this conformationmustbeimportantinthedynamicfunctions . The helical symmetry of F - actin changes when it binding other proteins , such as scruin 23 and cofilin 24 , suggesting that the axial twist can be modified easily by binding a protein over two neighbouring actin subunits , even though the twist is largely unchanged by thermal motion . Although cryoEM image analysis has advanced enough to allow the visualization of side chains for icosahedral viruses 25 – 27 and chapero - nins 28 , 29 , their large particle sizes that give rise to high - contrast images are still essential for accurate image alignment to achieve high - resolu - tion analysis . It is therefore thought that high - resolution analysis of small or thin objects , such as F - actin , is extremely difficult owing to their intrinsically low image contrast . We have demonstrated that our cryoEM technologies now allow us to visualize the secondary struc - tures of such thin objects as F - actin in a few days of work , including image data collection and processing and 3D image reconstruction . It would be easy to determine the structure of F - actin in complex with actin - binding proteins , such as myosin , troponin and tropomyosin , in similar detail , and such structures will bring us deep insights into the mechanisms of muscle contraction and regulation , cellular motility and morphogenesis . There is also room for further improvement , to reach atomic resolution . The present work offers a new opportunity to look into cellular mechanisms essential for the activities of life . e D3 D4 D1 D2 D3 D4 f D1 D2 D1 a b c d D1 D3 D2 Figure 3 | Comparison of actin models in F - actin with the uncomplexed crystal structure 16 .

A 2 . 1 - m l sample solution was applied onto a Quantifoil holey carbon mol - ybdenum grid ( R0 . 6 / 1 . 0 , Quantifoil ) and was plunge - frozen into liquid ethane using a fully automated vitrification device ( Vitrobot , FEI ) .

The specimen was observed at temperaturesof50 – 60KusingaJEOLJEM3200FSCelectronmicroscope , whichis equipped with a liquid - helium - cooled specimenstage , an V - type energyfilter and a field - emission electron gun operated at 200kV . Zero - energy - loss images , with a slit setting to remove electrons of an energy loss larger than 10eV , were recorded on a 4 , 000 3 4 , 000 15 - m m - per - pixel slow - scan CCD camera ( TemCam - F415MP , TVIPS ) atamagnificationofaround 3 172 , 000 , adefocusrangeof1 . 0 – 2 . 5 m mand an electron dose of , 20 electrons per square ångstro¨m . The magnification was calibratedbymeasuringthelayer - linespacingof23 . 0ÅintheFouriertransformof images of tobacco mosaic virus mixed in the sample solution . The image pixels of 0 . 87Åperpixelatthismagnificationwere twofold binnedtohave1 . 74Åperpixel for image analysis , to increase the signal - to - noise ratio . In total , 490 CCD images were collected manually in two days and used for image analysis . Imageanalysis . Helicalimageanalysiswascarriedoutbyusingtheiterativehelical real - space reconstruction method 13 with EMAN 1 . 9 31 and SPIDER 15 . 06 32 , as previously described 11 . Defocus and astigmatism of each image were determined using a slightly modified version of CTFFIND3 33 . Images of F - actin in 490 CCD frameswere boxedinto 27 , 240segmentsof 700 3 700pixels witha step shift of70 pixels along the filament axis using EMAN’s boxer program 31 . The number of actin molecules used for this reconstruction corresponds to , 120 , 000 . The in - plane orientation of F - actin in each segment was recorded in a list to avoid interpolation when rotating the image . Images were then corrected for a phase andamplitudecontrasttransferfunction ( CTF ) bymultiplyingtheCTFcalculated fromthedefocusandastigmatism . WeusedanamplitudeCTF / phaseCTFratioof 7 % ( ref . 34 ) . Thisprocedure forCTFcorrectionresults inthe multiplicationofthe originalstructurefactorbythe square oftheCTF ( CTF 2 ) andsuppressesthe noise around the nodes of the CTF , allowing more accurate image alignment . The amplitude modification by CTF 2 was corrected in the last stage of image analysis as described later . The images were then high - pass - filtered ( 285Å ) to remove a density undulation of low spatial frequency , normalized , decimated by a factor of two and cropped to 320 3 320 pixels . Image processing was mainly carried out with the SPIDER package 32 on a PC cluster computer with 40 CPUs ( RC server Calm2000 , Real Computing ) . A series of reference projection images were generated for each reference volume by rotating the volume azimuthally about the filament axis between 0 u and 360 u and projecting the volume at every 1 u to produce all the views . The variation of the out - of - plane tilt angle was limited to 6 10 u and was also sampled atevery1 u . TherawimagesoftheboxedF - actinsegmentsweretranslationallyand rotationally aligned and cross - correlated with the set of reference projections to produce the following information : an in - plane rotation angle , an x shift , a y shift , an azimuthal angle and a cross - correlation coefficient for each segment . Particles with a small cross - correlation coefficient were discarded . The polarity of the particles was tracked with respect to their respective filaments . Even with our high - contrast imaging technique , the orientation of each individual particle was sometime ambiguous owing to the relatively low contrast and high noise level of the segment images . Therefore , theorientation was defined as thatof the majority of the segments for each filament during each alignment cycle , and all the seg - mentsidentifiedtohavetheoppositeorientationwerediscarded . Onaverage , 95 % of the segmentsfrom anF - actinfilament showedthesame polarity , indicatingthe reliability of polarity determination . A 3D image was then reconstructed by back - projection . We used a solid cylinder with a diameter of 70Å as the initial reference volume toavoid any model bias in imagealignmentandreconstruction . The initial helical symmetry parameters were imposed on the first reconstruction to produce the new reference volume for the second round of image alignment . After this cycle , every time a 3D image was reconstructed , the symmetry of this new volume was determined by a least - squares fitting algorithm , and this symmetry was imposed on the reconstruction 13 . The new symmetry - enforced volume was used as a ref - erence for the next round of alignment . This process was repeated iteratively until the symmetry values converged to a stable solution . In the refinement phase , to reduce the noise in the reference and increase the accuracy of aliment , we used automask2 from the EMAN package to impose the edge smooth mask to the reconstruction . Theresultingreconstructionwasthenmodifiedbymultiplyingthetransformof the reconstruction by 1 / [ P CTF 2 1 1 / SNR ] ( SNR , signal - to - noise ratio ) to com - pensate for the amplitude distortion by the CTF . The map was scaled with a B factor of 2 180Å 2 . More than 97 % of the image data were used for the final reconstruction presented . Model refinement . We used the crystal structure of uncomplexed actin 16 ( PDB ID , 1J6Z ) as an initial model and divided it into four domains . In the first stage of the fitting process , we treated the four domains as rigid bodies and allowed the joints of these domains to be flexible . But residues 1 – 8 , 39 – 56 , 221 – 234 and 337 – 375 were clearly outside the density map . In the second stage , we allowed these residues to move flexibly to fit into the map under stereochemical restraints . We then applied thehelicalsymmetrytothissubunitmodeltobuild anF - actinmodel and minimized the conformational energy further using FlexEM to remove inter - molecular clashes of atoms . All the figures were made using UCSF Chimera 35 . Multireference alignment . On the basis of the refined atomic model of F - actin , we built 41 F - actin models with different rotation angles per subunit along the 1 - start helix , from 162 . 6 u to 170 . 6 u at every 0 . 2 u . We converted these models to 3D volumes at 8 . 0Å resolution using pdb2mrc 31 and used them as the reference volumestocarryoutmultireferencealignmentforthe27 , 240overlappingsegment images that we used for 3D image reconstruction . It should be noted that the relatively high level of random noise in cryoEM images due to low electron dose tends to cause the misalignment and , thereby , broadening of the angular distri - bution . Therefore , the actual distribution should be narrower than the one shown in the histogram of Fig . 1c . 31 . Ludtke , S . J . , Baldwin , P . R . & Chiu , W .
