Gerwinski Fachbereich Physik , Universit¨at GH Essen , 45117 Essen , Germany Using ﬁeld - theoretical methods and exploiting conformal invari - ance , we study Casimir forces at tricritical points exerted by long - range ﬂuctuations of the order - parameter ﬁeld . Special at - tention is paid to the situation where the symmetry is broken by the boundary conditions ( extraordinary transition ) . Besides the parallel - plate conﬁguration , we also discuss the geometries of two separate spheres and a single sphere near a planar wall , which may serve as a model for colloidal particles immersed in a ﬂuid . In the concrete case of ternary mixtures a quantitative comparison with critical Casimir and van der Waals forces shows that , especially with symmetry - breaking boundaries , the tricritical Casimir force is considerably stronger than the critical one and dominates also the competing van der Waals force . Therefore the prospects for an experimental veriﬁcation of the Casimir eﬀect at tricritical points should be good . Key words : Field theory , Casimir eﬀect , tricritical point , renormalization group , conformal invariance 1 Introduction In 1948 it was discovered by Casimir [ 1 ] that vacuum ﬂuctuations of the elec - tromagnetic ﬁeld give rise to an attractive force between uncharged conducting capacitor plates . Qualitatively speaking , the reason for the Casimir eﬀect is that the plates impose boundary conditions on the zero - point ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and , as a consequence , the vacuum energy of the system is changed in a distance - dependent way . Due to the masslessness of photons , the resulting interaction , the Casimir force , is long - ranged . In a re - cent experiment by Lamoreaux [ 2 ] the original result of Casimir was veriﬁed to within 5 % accuracy . Preprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint 1 February 2008 In the context of statistical and condensed matter physics it was pointed out by Fisher and de Gennes [ 3 ] that an analogous eﬀect should also exist at or near a critical point when the system considered is restricted by boundaries . In this case the critical ( long - range ) ﬂuctuations of the order - parameter ﬁeld play the role of vacuum ﬂuctuations and the critical theory , in a continuum description , is formally equivalent to a massless quantum ﬁeld theory . In recent years the Casimir eﬀect in statistical physics was studied theoreti - cally by conformal and perturbative methods [ 4 – 14 ] and by means of Monte Carlo simulations [ 15 ] . However , so far a direct experimental veriﬁcation of the statistical Casimir eﬀect has not been accomplished . For a review we refer to the book by Krech [ 16 ] . Most of the theoretical eﬀorts concentrated on the parallel - plate ( PP ) geometry and on ordinary critical points . Consider for example a ﬂuid that is conﬁned between two planar walls , with the lateral extension M and the area A ∝ M 2 , in a distance D from each other . Further , we assume that M ≫ D . In this system the singular part of the free energy at the bulk critical point T c asymptotically takes the form [ 11 , 16 ] F S A k B T c ≈ Mf bulk + f a + f b + δf ab , ( 1 ) where k B denotes the Boltzmann constant , f bulk is the bulk contribution , and f a and f b are the surface free energies of surface a and b , respectively . The last term ( 1 ) is the Casimir energy . As a consequence of the scaling invariance of F S it can be written as δf ab = ∆ ab D − ( d − 1 ) . ( 2 ) It is the contribution to the free energy that takes into account the interaction between the walls due to long - range ﬂuctuations . The amplitude ∆ ab in ( 2 ) is a universal quantity below the upper critical dimension d ∗ and only depends upon the surface universality classes to which the walls belong . For a detailed analysis of the scaling behavior of F S away from bulk criticality we again refer to Refs . [ 11 , 16 ] . How do surfaces aﬀect critical ﬂuctuations ? Now , in the framework of con - tinuum ﬁeld theory as for example the n - vector model , the surface inﬂuence can be modeled by additional ﬁelds like the surface magnetic ﬁeld h 1 and a local temperature perturbation ( surface enhancement ) , taking into account the interaction with an adjacent noncritical medium and a changed coupling strength near the surface within the medium , respectively [ 17 ] . At T c , where the bulk value of the order parameter—let us call it Φ—is zero , the tendency to order near the surface can be reduced ( ordinary transition ) , increased ( ex - traordinary transition ) , or , as a third possibility , the surface can be critical as well ( special transition ) . In the case of both the ordinary and the special 2 transition the symmetry with respect to Φ → − Φ at the surface is unbro - ken . In opposition to that , at the extraordinary transition the symmetry is broken explicitly or spontaneously [ 18 ] . In this case the surface is in an or - dered state , but the bulk , far away from the boundary , is disordered , the local magnetization m ( z ) decaying as ∼ z − β / ν for macroscopic distances [ 17 ] . In the present work , we focus our attention on systems at a tricritical point , in particular on those with symmetry - breaking boundaries . While the existing work on the tricritical Casimir eﬀect concentrated on symmetry - preserving surfaces [ 11 , 16 ] , there are several reasons why also the “extraordinary” situa - tion at tricritical points should be considered . It is known that for symmetry - preserving boundary conditions the tricritical Casimir amplitude is consid - erably larger than the corresponding critical amplitude [ 11 , 16 ] . The same tendency can be expected for symmetry - breaking boundaries . Additionally , the best candidates for the experimental veriﬁcation of the Casimir eﬀect at tricritical points , ternary ﬂuid mixtures , in general lead to a model with symmetry - breaking boundary conditions . Consider for instance a ternary mix - ture near its tricritical point . The order parameter Φ of this system is a linear combination of concentrations of the individual chemical components [ 19 ] . A surface—for example a container wall or the surface of a colloid particle im - mersed in the ﬂuid—will generically favor one of the chemical components , which means that the Φ → − Φ symmetry is broken explicitly by the surface . In turn , in the framework of lattice or continuum models this is taken into account by a nonzero surface ﬁeld h 1 . Since h 1 is relevant in the sense of the renormalization group this leads to the scenario of the extraordinary transition [ 17 , 18 ] . The case of 3 He - 4 He mixtures , more subtle than the one of ternary mixtures , will be addressed in Sec . 5 . Motivated by an experiment by Ducker et al . [ 21 ] , where the van der Waals force between a spherical ( mesoscopic ) particle and a container wall was mea - sured , we also consider ( besides the PP geometry ) various spherical geometries . Recently , it was pointed out [ 24 , 13 , 14 ] that conﬁgurations like two spheres immersed in a critical ﬂuid and a single sphere near a planar wall can be conformally mapped to two concentric spheres . Further , due to the rotational symmetry the latter can be treated on the MF level [ 24 ] , and , employing the conformal invariance of F S , the Casimir force can be calculated in the former conﬁgurations as well [ 13 , 14 ] . The rest of this article is organized as follows : In Sec . 2 and 3 the tricritical Casimir forces are calculated for planar and spherical geometries , respectively In Sec . 4 a quantitative comparison between van der Waals forces and Casimir forces with symmetry - breaking boundaries is carried out . In Sec . 5 possible experiments , especially on ternary or quaternary mixtures , are discussed , and the issue of 3 He - 4 He mixtures is addressed . 3 2 Parallel - Plate Geometry We ﬁrst derive the Casimir forces in the geometry of parallel plates . Since d = 3 , the spatial dimension we are interested in , is the upper critical dimension d ∗ for tricritical phenomena , we have to solve the model on the MF level and subsequently improve the result by renormalization - group considerations [ 20 ] . Our starting point is the Landau - Ginzburg functional for an n - component order parameter at the tricritical point H = Z V d 3 r L ( 3 ) with L = 1 2 ( ∇ ~ Φ ) · ( ∇ ~ Φ ) + g 6 ! (cid:16) ~ Φ 2 (cid:17) 3 , ( 4 ) where V denotes that the integration ranges over the whole critical medium . The Casimir force in the PP geometry can be written as [ 16 ] 1 A dF s dD = − k B T c hT zz i , ( 5 ) where A denotes the area of the plates that , as said above , are assumed to have a linear extension M much larger than the vertical distance D . In Eq . ( 5 ) and in the following T c denotes both critical and tricritical temperatures . Further , the cartesian stress tensor T ij is given by [ 26 ] T ij = ∂ i ~ Φ · ∂ j ~ Φ − δ ij L − 1 4 d − 2 d − 1 (cid:16) ∂ i ∂ j − δ ij ∇ 2 (cid:17) ~ Φ 2 , ( 6 ) and with ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 5 ) one obtains the relation [ 16 ] ∆ ab = D d d − 1 hT zz i ( 7 ) between the Casimir amplitude introduced in ( 2 ) and the zz component of the stress tensor . To derive the MF equation from H , we let ~ Φ point in the 1 - direction of the n - dimensional order - parameter space . Introducing the rescaled ﬁeld σ = ( g / 5 ! ) 1 / 4 Φ 1 , the MF equation reads d 2 σ dz 2 − σ 5 = 0 , ( 8 ) 4 and , after multiplication by dσ / dz , the ﬁrst integral of this equation is found to be I PP = dσ dz ! 2 − 1 3 σ 6 . ( 9 ) It only depends on the distance D between the plates and on the boundary conditions . The latter can be implemented a posteriori by selecting solutions that , in the case of symmetry - breaking surfaces , become singular upon ap - proaching the boundaries z = ± D / 2 . In the following we only consider the situation where σ ( z ) tends to + ∞ at both plates and , due to the symmetry , has a minimum at z = 0 . We denote this situation as ↑↑ boundary conditions , as opposed to the situation where for instance σ tends to ∞ at one surface and to −∞ at the other , denoted as the ↑↓ case . With the same boundary conditions at both surfaces the resulting Casimir force is generally attractive . In the other case , for example with ↑↓ boundary conditions , it is repulsive [ 16 ] . This also holds for the spherical geometries to be discussed in Sec . 3 . It is straighforward to show from ( 8 ) that the ﬁrst integral is given by I PP = − 8 √ 3 (cid:18) c 6 D (cid:19) 3 ( 10 ) with the constant c 6 = ∞ Z 1 dx √ x 6 − 1 = 0 . 70109 . . . . ( 11 ) Next , there is a close relationship between I PP and the zz - component of the stress tensor ( 6 ) that reads [ 14 ] T zz = 30 g ! 1 / 2 I PP . ( 12 ) and can be veriﬁed from ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) . Eventually , the MF ( or zero - loop ) result for the tricritical Casimir amplitude is ∆ ↑↑ = − 13 . 0768 . . . g 1 / 2 . ( 13 ) The analogous result for a critical point was derived in Ref . [ 10 ] . The Casimir amplitude in ( 13 ) as it stands still depends on the arbitrary coupling constant g . In order to remove this dependence , we have to invoke 5 standard renormalization - group arguments . In the scaling limit , the singular part of the free energy ( 1 ) should take the form F S ( M , D , g ) = k B T c F ( M / D , ¯ g ( l ) ) , ( 14 ) where l ≪ 1 is the spatial rescaling factor and the running coupling constant ¯ g ( l ) is given by [ 28 ] ¯ g ( l ) = 240 π 2 ( 3 n + 22 ) | ln l | . ( 15 ) Other ﬁelds ( like τ , h 1 , etc . ) that are not listed in the argument on the left - hand side of ( 14 ) are assumed to be adjusted to their ﬁxed - point values and , thus , are unaﬀected by the rescaling . In d = 3 − ǫ dimensions the MF amplitude ( 13 ) would yield the leading contribution in a perturbative series , in which ( after the subtraction of uv divergences ) the renormalized coupling constant could be set to its l → 0 value g ∗ ∝ ǫ . For d = d ∗ , on the other hand , the coupling must not be set to its ﬁxed - point value g ∗ = 0 in ( 13 ) . Instead , the rescaling parameter l can be replaced by a / D [ 37 ] , where a is a microscopic length scale , typically in the range of a few ˚A , as opposed to D which we assume to be mesoscopic or macroscopic , of the order of µ m , say . With ( 5 ) and ( 13 ) and after it has been brought into the scaling form with ( 14 ) , the result for the Casimir force reads f tc PP A ≃ − 0 . 54 k B T c ( 3 n + 22 ) 1 / 2 ( ln D / a ) 1 / 2 D − 3 . ( 16 ) Corrections to ( 16 ) from higher - order terms in the perturbative series are suppressed logarithmically , i . e . , by powers of ln D / a . At the ﬁrst glance it appears that the logarithmic term in ( 16 ) modiﬁes the D - dependence of the Casimir force from ∼ D − 3 to ∼ ( ln D ) 1 / 2 | D − 3 . That this modiﬁcation can also be regarded as a correction and , thus , may be dropped when one only considers the leading asymptotic behavior , can be seen by rewriting ln D / a = ln D 0 / a + ln D / D 0 , where D 0 is another macroscopic con - stant length scale . Then the result for the Casimir amplitude is ∆ tc ↑↑ = − 0 . 27 ( 3 n + 22 ) 1 / 2 Ω 0 , ( 17 ) 6 where Ω 0 is deﬁned as Ω 0 : = (cid:18) ln D 0 a (cid:19) 1 / 2 . ( 18 ) As opposed to the situation below d ∗ , where one really ﬁnds a universal scalar amplitude , at a tricritical point in d = d ∗ = 3 we have additionally a nonuni - versal scalar factor Ω 0 , expressing a dependence of the physics at a macro - scopic scale D 0 on the macroscopic scale a . This phenomenon does not occur in a tricritical system with both surfaces preserving the symmetry [ 11 ] . Then the leading asymptotic contribution to the Casimir energy is given by the universal amplitude of the Gaussian model ( g = 0 in the Eq . ( 4 ) ) . In this case only corrections to scaling depend on the microscopic scale . A situation largely analogous to the symmetry - breaking case discussed above is known from polymers near the θ - point [ 22 ] . Even if we do not know D 0 / a in ( 18 ) in practice , the dependence on this ratio , as it comes in as the square root of the logarithm , turns out to be very weak . For instance when D 0 / a is varied over two orders of magnitude from 100 to 10000 ( which should be a reasonable range from the point of view of the experiments ) , Ω 0 varies between 2 . 1 and 3 , i . e . , it changes only by about 40 % . 3 Spherical Geometries Following Ref . [ 14 ] the conformal invariance at a critical point can be exploited to calculate Casimir forces in conformally equivalent geometries . For instance in the highly symmetric geometry of two concentric spheres ( CON ) with radii R − and R + of Fig . 1 , the singular part of the free energy only depends upon ρ = R − / R + . The derivative of F S with respect to ρ is given by [ 14 ] ρ d d ρ F S ( ρ ) = k B T c S d r d 0 hT rr ( r 0 ) i CON , ( 19 ) where T rr is the projection of the stress tensor ( 6 ) on the radial direction , S d denotes the surface area of the d - dimensional unit sphere , and r 0 is an inner point between the two spheres . 7 D R - R + CON SES D R SPW D PP Fig . 1 . The geometries of parallel plates ( PP ) , concentric spheres ( CON ) , spheres of equal size ( SES ) , and sphere and planar wall ( SPW ) considered in Sec . 2 and 3 . The gray areas represent the noncritical medium ( wall ) . The MF equation for the rescaled order - parameter ﬁeld σ that now only de - pends on r takes the form d 2 σ dr 2 + d − 1 r dσ dr − σ 5 = 0 . ( 20 ) This equation is a diﬀerential equation of the Emden - Fowler type [ 29 , 24 , 14 ] , and a ﬁrst integral exists ( only ) in d = 3 : I CON = r 3 d 2 σ dr 2 + r 2 σ dσ dr − 1 3 r 3 σ 6 . ( 21 ) Like in the PP case we are interested in ↑↑ boundary conditions , i . e . where σ becomes inﬁnite at both the inner and the outer sphere , respectively . In this case there exists a relation between ρ and I CON that can be expressed in the form ρ = exp " − s 3 pq F ( α , k ) # , ( 22 ) 8 where F ( α , k ) is the elliptic integral of the ﬁrst kind [ 32 ] , and the arguments are α = 2 arctan s q p ! k = s ( p + q ) 2 − a 2 4 pq ( 23 ) with p = s b 2 + 9 4 a 2 q = s b 2 + 1 4 a 2 a = A + + A − b = √ 3 2 ( A + − A − ) , ( 24 ) and the dependence of A ± on I CON is given by A ± = (cid:18) − 3 2 I CON ± 1 8 q 1 + 144 I 2 CON (cid:19) 1 / 3 . ( 25 ) Moreover , analogously to ( 12 ) the relation between the ﬁrst integral and the stress tensor reads r 30 T rr ( r 0 ) = 30 g ! 1 / 2 I CON ( 26 ) such that on the MF level the Casimir force in ( 19 ) can be obtained as a function of ρ . Now , the concentric geometry is conformally equivalent to various other ge - ometries [ 14 ] . For example by inversion at an inner point in between the con - centric spheres the system is mapped to a geometry where two separate spheres are immersed in a surrounding ( critical ) medium . If the point of inversion lies at the geometric mean ( R − R + ) 1 / 2 , one obtains spheres of equal size ( SES ) . Likewise , inversion at one of the radii , R − or R + , generates a geometry in which a single sphere is placed in a given distance from a planar wall ( SPW ) . All the geometries treated in the present work are depicted in Fig . 1 . 9 At ( and above ) the upper critical dimension conformal invariance does not hold anymore [ 23 ] . However , on the MF level the ﬁeld theory described by ( 4 ) is conformally invariant just in d = 3 . Further , since we are only interested in boundary conditions that correspond to renormalization - group ﬁxed points , conformal invariance is not aﬀected by the boundaries either [ 31 ] . Hence , the MF approximation to the Casimir force , obtained for instance in the CON ge - ometry , can directly be translated to other conformally equivalent geometries ( like SPW or SES ) . As discussed in more detail in Ref . [ 14 ] , F S depends upon certain invariant cross ratios of the geometric dimensions [ 23 ] , a convenient parameter to quan - tify the dependence on the geometry being κ =   12 ( ρ + 1 / ρ ) for CON D 2 / ( 2 R 2 ) + 2 D / R + 1 for SES D / R + 1 for SPW . ( 27 ) Thus for instance the force in the SPW geometry derived from the known result of the CON geometry , is given by f tc SPW = − dF S dD = − dF S dρ dρ dD , ( 28 ) where the ﬁrst factor on the right - hand side can be derived from ( 19 ) , and dρ / dD can be calculated from ( 27 ) . With ( 26 ) we obtain the MF result f tc SPW = k B T c 30 g ! 1 / 2 I CON ( ρ ) ( D 2 + 2 DR ) 1 / 2 . ( 29 ) As the next step , in the new geometry , the MF result has to be improved by means of scaling arguments , much in the same way as discussed in Sec . 2 for the PP geometry . The renormalization - group improvement again yields a nonuniversal factor Ω 0 ( see Eq . ( 18 ) ) , where now distance scales of the new geometry ( SPW or SES ) enter . Eventually , the results for the Casimir force in the SPW and SES geometries are given by f tc SPW = k B T c ( 6 n + 44 ) 1 / 2 Ω 0 I CON ( ρ ) ( D 2 + 2 DR ) 1 / 2 ( 30 ) 10 and f tc SES = k B T c ( 6 n + 44 ) 1 / 2 Ω 0 2 I CON ( ρ ) ( D 2 + 4 DR ) 1 / 2 , ( 31 ) respectively , where ρ = ρ ( D ) can be obtained from ( 27 ) . For the concrete example of a ternary mixture with T c = 300 K , spheres with a radius R = 1 µ m , and with the nonuniversal factor set toΩ 0 = 2 , the results are plotted in Figs . 1 and 2 and compared with the van der Waals forces . 4 Comparison with the critical Casimir eﬀect and van - der - Waals forces For a quantitative comparison between the tricritical and the critical Casimir eﬀect and the van der Waals forces let us ﬁrst consider the PP geometry and a system with an Ising - like order parameter ( n = 1 ) . Then from ( 17 ) we ﬁnd for the tricritical Casimir amplitude ∆ tc ↑↑ = − 1 . 35 Ω 0 , where the nonuniversal factor Ω 0 was deﬁned in ( 18 ) . In a recent preprint [ 30 ] , Krech obtained ∆ c ↑↑ ≃ − 0 . 35 for the Casimir am - plitude of a critical Ising - like system in d = 3 . Hence , taking into account that Ω 0 > ∼ 2 , the tricritical Casimir amplitude is about seven times larger then the corresponding critical amplitude , and , at least as far as the magnitude of the force is concerned , tricritical points should be better suited for the exper - imental veriﬁcation of the Casimir eﬀect than critical points at comparable temperatures . How does the Casimir eﬀect compare with the van der Waals force ? The result for the van der Waals force in the PP geometry is given by [ 33 ] f vdW PP A = − H 6 π 1 D 3 ( 32 ) where H is the Hamaker constant , a material - dependent quantity that in most systems lies somewhere between 10 − 19 J and 10 − 21 J [ 33 ] . For the sake of concreteness , let us set the Hamaker constant to a typical value of about H = 10 − 20 J . Taking then the ratio between tricritical Casimir and van der Waals force we ﬁnd f tc PP f vdW PP ≃ 0 . 07 Ω 0 T c / K . ( 33 ) Hence , even if the tricritical temperature were about 1 K—in Helium mixtures 11 it is 0 . 867 K— and we set Ω 0 ≃ 2 as before , the Casimir force amounts to more than 10 % of the van der Waals force . This is diﬀerent if symmetry - preserving boundaries are considered ; in this case the Casimir force is merely a 1 % eﬀect [ 11 ] . For ternary mixtures , where usually systems are studied with T c near room temperature , the Casimir force becomes even considerably stronger than the van der Waals attraction . 100 1 0 . 01 0 . 0001 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 D ( nm ) f o r ce ( n N ) Fig . 2 . The tricritical Casimir force ( solid ) and the van der Waals force ( dashed ) in SPW geometry of Fig . 1 for T c = 300 K , particle radius R = 1 µ m and Hamaker con - stant H = 10 − 20 J . The grey shaded area indicates the regime with force f > ∼ 0 . 2 nN where direct measurements should be feasible ( cf . Ref . [ 20 ] . ) As the next example let us consider the case SPW in Fig . 1 . In this geometry direct measurements of the van der Walls force by means of an atomic force microscope were reported by Ducker et al . [ 21 ] , and it should be feasible to carry out a similar measurement with a critical or tricritical ﬂuid . For the SPW geometry an approximative expression for the nonretarded van der Waals force [ 33 ] f vdW SPW = − 2 H 3 R 3 ( D + 2 R ) 2 D 2 ( 34 ) can be obtained . A direct comparison between ( 34 ) and our result ( 30 ) is carried out in Fig . 2 . Again , H was set to the typical value of 10 − 20 J . For the Casimir force ( solid curve ) we assumed that T c = 300 K and Ω 0 = 2 . For large distances D ≫ R , the Casimir force decays more slowly than the van der Waals result ( dashed line ) , the former behaving as ∼ D − 3 / 2 and the latter as D − 4 . For small ( but still macroscopic ) distances distances a ≪ D ≪ R , both 12 the Casimir and the van der Waals force show the same D - dependence ∼ D − 2 . The reason for this coincidence is that this limit is closely connected to the PP geometry [ 14 ] , the ratio of amplitudes being given by ( 33 ) . The grey shaded area in Fig . 2 shows the regime with forces > ∼ 0 . 2 nN , where the measurement with an atomic force microscope , like the one reported in Ref . [ 21 ] , should be possible . 100 1 0 . 01 0 . 0001 D ( nm ) f o r ce ( n N ) 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 Fig . 3 . The tricrittical Casimir force ( solid ) and the asymptotic van der Waals results ( dashed ) in SES geometry of Fig . 1 with the same parameters as in Fig . 2 . Eventually , the results for the SES geometry are displayed in Fig . 3 . For the nonretarded van der Waals force the two asymptotic power laws for small and large distances ( dashed lines ) are taken from Ref . [ 33 ] . The solid line shows the result of Eq . ( 31 ) , again for T c = 300 K , Ω 0 = 2 , and R = 1 µ m . For D ≫ R the curves approach zero as ∼ D − 6 ( van der Waals ) and ∼ D − 2 ( Casimir ) , respectively . Again , in both cases the force behaves as ∼ D − 2 for short distances . In particular , this means that f tc SES has the same D - dependence in both limits for D ≪ R and D ≫ R , with diﬀerent amplitudes , however , as indicated by the swerve in Fig . 3 at the crossover distance D ≃ R = 1 µ m . 5 Prospects for Experiments Probably the best candidates for experiments on the tricritical Casimir eﬀect are ternary or quaternary mixtures of ﬂuids , the latter with the advantage 13 that they can be “tuned” to have a tricritical point at atmospheric pressure [ 38 ] . The order parameter Φ in these systems is Ising - like , a linear combination of concentrations of the single components . As said in the Introduction , the surface will generically favor one of the components of the ﬂuid , amounting to an explicit symmetry breaking at the surface . In the scaling limit this leads to the scenario of the extraordinary transition [ 17 , 18 ] . Additionally , systems can be chosen with their T c at or around the room temperature . Hence , as the singular part of the free energy behaves as ∼ T , the magnitude of the Casimir force in ﬂuid mixtures should be larger by about two orders of magnitude than in Helium mixtures ( to be discussed in the next paragraph ) . In mixtures of 3 He and 4 He the tricritical point is located at T c = 867mK and x c = 0 . 675 mole fraction of 3 He . It is well known that pure 4 He belongs to the universality class of the ordinary transition , because the quantum - mechanical wave function that describes the superﬂuid state goes to zero at the surface . Now , as long as the fraction of 3 He is not too large ( x < ∼ 0 . 54 ) also in He mixtures the scenario of the ordinary transition holds [ 34 ] . However , for x beyond a certain value x s ≃ 0 . 54 a superﬂuid layer ( rich in 4 He ) forms already above the λ line [ 34 ] , i . e . , in the language of surface critical phenomena a surface transition [ 17 ] takes place . Since the superﬂuid layer is eﬀectively two - dimensional and the system possesses a continuous O ( 2 ) symmetry , it is in a Kosterlitz - Thouless phase [ 35 ] . The latter was also veriﬁed by the experiment [ 36 ] . Note that there is no physical h 1 in this system that couples to the order parameter . In the framework of the continuum description the surface transition is triggered by the negative surface enhancement [ 25 ] . Upon approaching the λ - line from above in the concentration range x s < x ≤ x c , due to the growing correlation length the superﬂuid layer becomes thick and a dimensional crossover [ 39 ] from the Kosterlitz - Thouless phase to a three - dimensional superﬂuid phase should take place [ 40 ] . As a consequence , Helium mixtures in the mentioned concentration range also appear to be a candidate for a system with symmetry - breaking boundary conditions . However , since the dimensional crossover , in particular the one between a Kosterlitz - Thouless phase ( in d = 2 ) and the ordered phase of the XY - model ( in d = 3 ) , is not fully understood , it is far from clear that the scenario of the extraordinary transition applies [ 34 ] . However , concerning the Casimir force and other critical surface eﬀects there should deﬁnitely be a diﬀerence between x < x s and x > x s , presumably with a qualitatively new type of Casimir amplitude for x > x s that can not be adequately described in the framework of the known surface universality classes ( ordinary , extraordinary , or special ) . An interesting question that could also be addressed in such experiments is related to critical dynamics . The results for the Casimir force presented in the previous sections are ensemble averages . Due to ﬂuctuations in space and time , individual members of an ensemble deviate from the thermal average , 14 i . e . , for instance in the PP geometry the local pressure will vary in lateral direction . Also the van der Waals force , being closely related to the original electromagnetic Casimir eﬀect , is an average over ﬂuctuations , this time of quantum - mechanical nature , however . The typical time scale on which ﬂuctu - ations of the van der Waals force take place is given by D / c , where c is the speed of light . On a presumably much larger time scale , behaving as ∼ D ζ , the ﬂuctuations of the Casimir force take place , where ζ denotes the dynamic ( equilibrium ) exponent of model H in the terminology of Ref . [ 41 ] . In the PP geometry when M ≫ ξ ≫ D this time dependence would be probably absent because the average over the lateral directions is taken . In the SPW geometry , however , the time dependence of the critical ﬂuctuations taking place on a potentially macroscopic scale should be observable . Finally we should like to emphasize the long - range nature of the Casimir forces speciﬁc to symmetry - breaking boundary conditions . For the critical case it was pointed out by de Gennes [ 42 ] and studied in more detail in Refs . [ 13 , 14 ] that in the SES geometry for large distances the Casimir free energy decays as ∼ D − 2 β / ν . With β / ν ≃ 0 . 52 for the d = 3 Ising system , this is already very close to a Coulomb potential . The tricritical Casimir free energy falls oﬀ exactly as ∼ D − 1 . As already discussed in Ref . [ 14 ] , this should have consequences for the thermodynamics of charged stabilized colloids when the correlation length in the solvent becomes comparable or larger than the average distance of colloid particles . In particular we expect reversible ﬂocculation near a critical or tricritical point . Flocculation phenomena in ﬂuid mixtures near critical points have already been reported in the literature [ 43 , 45 ] . 6 Summary and Concluding Remarks We studied the Casimir eﬀect at tricritical points with symmetry - breaking boundary conditions . The case of symmetry - preserving boundaries was treated earlier in the literature by Krech and Dietrich [ 11 ] . The leading asymptotic behavior of the Casimir force in d = 3 is determined by the mean - ﬁeld theory , improved by renormalization - group considerations . Diﬀerent from critical sys - tems and tricritical systems with symmetry - preserving boundaries , where the Casimir amplitude is universal , at a tricritical point with symmetry - breaking boundaries a nonuniversal factor occurs . As expressed in ( 18 ) , this factor de - pends on the ratio between a typical macroscopic and a microscopic length , and we estimated it to lie between 2 and 3 for a typical experimental setting . Our calculations were restricted to bulk tricriticality , but the results derived should hold more generally when the correlation length ξ is larger or much larger than D . In case that ξ becomes comparable to D , the force should decrease , and in particular for ξ ≪ D it should decay exponentially . 15 Up to date neither the critical nor the tricritical Casimir eﬀect have been veri - ﬁed in the experiment . The most promising candidates for experiments on the tricritical Casimir eﬀect are ternary mixtures and quaternary mixtures of ﬂu - ids . Concerning the geometry we suggested either the parallel - plate geometry , in which the electromagnetic Casimir eﬀect was veriﬁed successfully [ 2 ] , or the geometry of a sphere near a planar wall , in which the van der Waals force was measured with an atomic force microscope [ 21 ] . In particular in ﬂuid mixtures the tricritical Casimir eﬀect should dominate the van der Waals force . As another candidate for experiments on the tricritical Casimir eﬀect we dis - cussed Helium mixtures . In this case it turned out that above a certain con - centration x s > 0 . 54 and in particular at the tricritical value x c = 0 . 675 the surface eﬀects are neither covered by the scenario of the ordinary transition nor by the one of the extraordinary transition , for the surface undergoes a transition to a Kosterlitz - Thouless phase [ 34 ] . Hence , it requires further the - oretical studies to obtain the corresponding Casimir amplitudes . Finally we mention that there are other obvious directions in which the the - oretical work on the statistical Casimir eﬀect should be extended . Besides critical and tricritical points , complex ﬂuid mixtures exhibit a variety of in - teresting critical phenomena , like for example double or quadruple critical points , discussed in the literature under the heading of reentrant phase tran - sitions [ 44 ] . The parameters in these systems , the temperature , the pressure , and the various concentrations can be well controlled , and the experiments reveal an intriguing spectrum of phenomena as for example the doubling of critical exponents at a double critical point [ 45 ] . It would be certainly of in - terest to study surface critical phenomena and , especially , the Casimir eﬀect also at these special critical points . Acknowledgements : We thank H . W .
