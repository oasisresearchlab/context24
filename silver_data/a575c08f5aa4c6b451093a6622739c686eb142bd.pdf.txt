Here , we show that the apoptosis , which is of a nonanoikis type , is caused by ROCK - dependent hyperactivation of actomyosin and efﬁciently sup - pressed by the myosin inhibitor Blebbistatin . The actomyosin hyperactivation is triggered by the loss of E - cadherin - dependent intercellular contact and also observed in dissociated mouse epiblast - derived pluripotent cells but not in mESCs . We reveal that Abr , a unique Rho - GEF family factor containing a functional Rac - GAP domain , is an indispensable upstream regulator of the apoptosis and ROCK / myosin hyperactivation . Rho activation coupled with Rac inhibition is induced in hESCs upon dissociation , but not in Abr - depleted hESCs or mESCs . Further - more , artiﬁcial Rho or ROCK activation with Rac inhibition restores the vulnerability of Abr - depleted hESCs to dissociation - induced apoptosis . Thus , the Abr - dependent ‘‘Rho - high / Rac - low’’ state plays a decisive role in initiating the dissociation - induced actomyosin hyperactivation and apoptosis in hESCs . INTRODUCTION Although hESCs are pluripotent cells derivatized from the blasto - cyst embryo like mESCs , there are in fact several substantial differences between them ( Thomson et al . , 1998 ; Sato et al . , 2003 ) . Among the interspecies differences , a particularly intrigu - ing one is the requirement of hESCs to be cultured as cell clumps because they undergo apoptosis when dissociated ( Watanabe et al . , 2007 and references therein ) . Their apoptotic response is remarkably extensive and their fragility upon dissociation has been a large obstacle to the development of techniques for manipulating hESCs . We recently reported that the application of Y - 27632 , a speciﬁc inhibitor for Rho - dependent protein kinase ( ROCK ) , permit the survival of hESCs in clonal culture by efﬁ - ciently blocking the dissociation - induced cell death ( Watanabe et al . , 2007 ; also see an example of greatly improved plating efﬁ - ciency in Figure S1A available online ) . The addition of the ROCK inhibitor to dissociated hESCs has already greatly improved a number of practical procedures . However , several fundamental questions about the ROCK - dependent hESC apoptosis have remained unsolved to date . For instance , it is not known how Y - 27632 protects dissociated hESCs from massive cell death , what the upstream signals are that trigger the hESC apoptosis after dissociation , why only hESCs , but not mESCs , are vulnerable to dissociation - induced cell death , or what the biological relevance of the dissociation - induced hESC death is . ROCK , the target of Y - 27632 , is one of the major downstream mediators of Rho ( Riento and Ridley , 2003 ; Harb et al . , 2008 ; Krawetz et al . , 2009 ) . The GTP - bound form of Rho interacts with ROCK , inducing a conformational change in ROCK that elevates its kinase activity . Rho signaling plays crucial regulatory roles in cellular proliferation , differentiation , cytokinesis , motility , adhesion , and cytoskeletal arrangement ( Jaffe and Hall , 2005 ) . At the molecular level , Rho subfamily members , such as Rho and Rac ( Burridge and Wennerberg , 2004 ) , function as molecular switches that cycle between GDP - bound inactive and GTP - bound active forms . This transition is strictly controlled by the cooperationofpositiveandnegativeregulators . Thepositivereg - ulator molecules , termed GEFs ( guanine nucleotide exchange factors ) , can activate speciﬁc Rho subfamily molecules . The negative regulators , called GAPs ( GTPase activating proteins ) , can reverse this reaction by facilitating the hydrolysis of the bound GTP . Rho / ROCK activation induces various outcomes depending on the cellular context ( Riento and Ridley , 2003 ) . Although a number of substrates for ROCK have been already identiﬁed as potential downstream effectors ( Riento and Ridley , 2003 ; Cell Stem Cell 7 , 225 – 239 , August 6 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 225 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 % A nne x i n V + c e ll s hr after dissociation control Y - 27632 zVAD 0 80 60 40 20 100 h ES C m ES C 0hr 6hr 0 60 80 40 20 m o ck dn F A DD B c l - X L 0hr 6hr 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 2 4 6 8 control Y - 27632 T M R M + c e ll s ( % ) hr after dissociation cyto c Hsc70 0 1 2 4 6 % b l ebb i ng 0 40 80 20 60 100 c on t r o l Y - 27632 z VA D 0 40 80 20 60 100 h ES C m ES C 0 2 4 1 3 5 0 60 120 180 240 300 v enu s / C F P r a t i o min after dissociation 0 120 600 240 480 min after dissociation 360 0 2 4 1 3 v enu s / C F P r a t i o 5 P 04 : 06 : 00 04 : 02 : 00 03 : 54 : 00 03 : 52 : 00 04 : 06 : 00 04 : 02 : 00 03 : 54 : 00 03 : 52 : 00 03 : 50 : 00 10 : 00 : 00 05 : 00 : 00 00 : 03 : 00 01 : 00 : 00 00 : 00 : 00 10 : 00 : 00 05 : 00 : 00 00 : 03 : 00 01 : 00 : 00 12 : 00 : 00 06 : 00 : 00 03 : 00 : 00 01 : 00 : 00 12 : 00 : 00 06 : 00 : 00 03 : 00 : 00 01 : 00 : 00 12 : 00 : 00 06 : 00 : 00 03 : 00 : 00 01 : 00 : 00 01 : 00 : 00 % A nne x i n V + c e ll s 1 2 1 2 3 hr after dissociation 1 2 1 2 3 % b l ebb i ng % A nne x i n V + c e ll s A B C D E F m ES C h ES C G I + Y - 27632 + z VA D L M h E S C c a s pa s e - 3 H J K H2B / Lyn F R E T O + B c l - X c a s p a s e - 3 F R E T L N 00h : 00m : 00s 00h : 00m : 00s 00h : 00m : 00s 00h : 00m : 00s 00h : 00m : 00s 03h : 50m : 00s SCAT3 rupture no rupture hESC SCAT3 12 : 00 : 00 06 : 00 : 00 03 : 00 : 00 100 * * n . s . high low high low Cell Stem Cell Mechanism of Dissociated - Induced Apoptosis in hESCs 226 Cell Stem Cell 7 , 225 – 239 , August 6 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . Jaffe and Hall , 2005 ) , the responsible effecter for a variety of cases is still uncertain . In particular , the downstream effectors in the survival - or - death regulation of hESCs have been unknown . In this study , we ﬁrst demonstrate that the ROCK - dependent hyperactivation of myosin is the direct cause of dissociation - induced apoptosis in hESCs . Disruption of E - cadherin - mediated cell - cell adhesion is sufﬁcient to trigger an immediate activation of the Rho / ROCK / MLC2 signaling cascade . This dissociation - induced myosin hyperactivation is speciﬁc to the epiblast - equiv - alent cell state rather than to their species of origin . We also show the involvement of a unique Rho - GEF family factor , Abr , as an essential role in this regulation and the biased activity of Rho versus Rac as a critical factor for this phenomenon . RESULTS Dissociation of hESCs Causes a ROCK - Dependent Early Apoptotic Response via the Mitochondrial Pathway We ﬁrst sought to clarify how early after dissociation the apoptotic reaction begins and which apoptotic pathway is involved there . FACS analysis showed an obvious increase in the Annexin V + population of hESCs ( cells undergoing apoptosis or dead ones ) even a few hours after dissociation ( Figure 1A ; control , black ; also see Figures S1B and S1C ) . At the 6 hr time point , the majority ( about three quarters ) of the dissociated hESC population was already positive for this early apoptosis marker ( Figure 1B , lane 1 ) . Such an apoptotic response was not observed in dissociated mESCs ( lane 2 ) . The rapid induction of the apoptosis marker in hESCs was signiﬁcantly inhibited by the addition of the ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 or the pan - Caspase inhibitor zVAD ( Figure 1A ; red and blue ) . Strong suppression of apoptosis was also seen when both ROCK - I and - II were knocked down by RNAi ( lane 4 in Figure S1Dc ; Figures S1Da and S1Db for RNAi controls ) . The overexpression of dominant - negative FADD ( dnFADD ) , which efﬁciently blocks the FAS - FADD pathway , a typical non - mitochondrial cascade , did not have a substantial effect on the apoptosis marker ( Figure 1C , lane 2 ; see Figure S1E for controls ) . In contrast , the overexpression of Bcl - X L , which antagonizes the upstream trigger of the mitochondrial pathway ( Youle and Strasser , 2008 ) , markedly decreased the Annexin V + population ( lane 3 ) . Furthermore , the mitochondrial potential ( indicated by the TMRM dye ) decreased after cell dissociation ( Figure 1D , red ) and this reduction was inhibited by Y - 27632 ( Figure 1D , blue ) . In addition , the cytoplasmic release of cytochrome C , a major messenger of the mitochondrial pathway ( Youle and Strasser , 2008 ) , was observed with a similar time course as the decrease in TMRM + staining ( Figure 1E ) . These ﬁndings showed that the mitochondrial pathway plays a major role in the early apoptotic response downstream of ROCK activity . The ROCK - Dependent Apoptosis of Dissociated hESCs Is Associated with an Atypical , Extensive Early - Onset Blebbing We next performed live - cell imaging during the early phase of dissociation culture ( Figures 1F – 1L ) . Unlike dissociated mESCs , which spread normally on the plate bottom and were not partic - ularly mobile ( Figure 1F and Movie S1 , part A ) , the dissociated hESC exhibited a high motility and formed a number of blebs on their cell surface ( Figures 1G and 1H ; also see Figure S1G ) . The blebbing began immediately upon the start of the dissocia - tion culture and continued until the cells burst and formed apoptotic bodies ( Movie S1 , part B ) . This blebbing in the disso - ciated hESCs was strongly suppressed by Y - 27632 ( Figures 1I and 1J and Movie S1 , part C ) . The suppression of blebbing appeared to require the continuous ( or concurrent ) presence of Y - 27632 at least during the ﬁrst 6 – 12 hr . The cells that had once calmly spread on the plate bottom in the presence of Y - 27632 started blebbing when the Y - 27632 was removed after - wards ( Figure S1H ) . Conversely , cells that had started blebbing ( but were not yet dead ) in the absence of Y - 27632 stopped bleb - bing upon the later addition of Y - 27632 ( Figure S1I ) . Similar early - onset blebbing was also observed in dissociated human iPS cells ( see Experimental Procedures ) . Blebbing is an indication of unregulated hyperactivation of the actomyosin system ( Charras and Paluch , 2008 ) , which leads to Figure 1 .

This repeatedly causes multiple local detachments of the plasma membrane ( evagination ) from the cytoskeleton ( Charras et al . , 2005 ; Charras et al . , 2006 ) . Some transient blebbing is generally observed in dying cells , but occurs only for a short period during the terminal phase of apoptosis when cells are close to cell bursting ( Cole - man et al . , 2001 ; Sebbagh et al . , 2001 ) . In contrast , the blebbing of dissociated hESCs started soon after dissociation , long before the cell burst , and continued for a substantial length of time until the cells burst from a few hours to a day ( Figure 1G ) . By careful observation with multicolor ﬂuorescence live imag - ing , the plasma membrane movement of the dissociated hESC ( shown by Lyn - mCherry ) per se was indistinguishable from that of conventional blebbing : a rapid outward protrusion of sac - like blebs ( within a few seconds ; Figure 1K ) and their subsequent slow retraction ( a few minute later ) ( Figures S2A – S2C and Movie S1 , parts D – F ) . The conventional blebbing at the terminal phase of apoptosis is typically caused by the Caspase - 3 - induced cleavage of ROCK - I , which then becomes constitutively active ( Coleman et al . , 2001 ; Sebbagh et al . , 2001 ) . In dissociated hESCs , however , the caspase inhibitor zVAD did not substantially inhibit the blebbing ( Figures 1J and 1L ) , although it suppressed the appearance of the apoptosis marker Annexin V ( Figure 1A ) . In addition , we did not detect the cleaved form of ROCK - I in a western blot ( data not shown ) . These ﬁndings indicated that the blebbing of hESCs is also atypical in its molecular regulation and does not occur downstream of caspases . We next carried out a time - course study , in which the Caspase activity was measured in real - time FRET assay ( Figures 1M – 1P and Figures S2D – S2G ) . The level of Caspase - 3 activity remained low until (cid:1) 10 min before cell rupture , when an abrupt all - or - none - type activation was observed ( Figures 1M and 1N ; Movie S2 , part A ; the SCAT3 FRET probe gives a high Venus / CFP ﬂuo - rescence ratio when the Caspase - 3 activity is low ; Takemoto et al . , 2003 ) . A similar observation was made in the temporal proﬁle of Caspase - 9 activation ( the SCAT9 probe ; Takemoto et al . , 2003 ) , which occurs upstream of Caspase - 3 in the mito - chondrial pathway , except that the Caspase - 9 activation started earlier ( (cid:1) 30 min before cell rupture ) and became elevated more gradually than the Caspase - 3 activation ( Figures S2D and S2E ) . Thus , the robust terminal activation of both Caspases occurred much later than the onset of blebbing . Both the blebbing and the Caspase - 3 activation were inhibited by Y - 27632 treatment ( not shown ) and by ROCK - I / II - knockdown ( Figures S2F and S2G ; Movie S2 , part B ) . Consistent with the zVAD data , the blebbing was not substantially inhibited when the Caspase - 3 activation was suppressed by overexpressing Bcl - X L , which prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis ( Figures 1O and 1P ; Movie S2 , part C ) . These observations at the single - cell level demonstrated that the blebbing seen in dissociated hESCs is not the consequence of a strong precocious activation of Caspases but instead is directly associated with ROCK activity . Rho / ROCK - Mediated Hyperactivation of Myosin Is a Primary Cause of Rapid Apoptosis of Dissociated hESCs We next analyzed how the ROCK activity was regulated after dissociation . In pull - down assays , an elevated level of active Rho ( GTP - bound ) was observed upon dissociation ( Fig - ure 2A ) . Similarly , substantial augmentation of ROCK activity was observed upon dissociation in the in vitro kinase assay with ROCK proteins immunoprecipitated from hESC lysates ( Fig - ure S3A ; MYPT1 was used as a substrate ) . Western blot analysis showed that the phosphorylation level of the nonmuscle myosin light chain 2 ( MLC2 ) , a known ROCK substrate ( Riento and Ridley , 2003 ) , was signiﬁcantly and continuously elevated after dissociation ( Figure 2B ) . This elevation of phosphorylated MLC2 ( pMLC2 ) in dissociated hESCs was inhibited by both Y - 27632 and the Rho inhibitor C3 ( Figure 2C , lanes 4 and 6 ) , con - sistent with previous reports on the Rho - ROCK - myosin axis functioning in a variety of cells including pluripotent cells ( Harb et al . , 2008 ) . In addition , three other ROCK inhibitors ( HA1077 , H - 1152P , and GSK269962A ) attenuated MLC2 phosphorylation at the concentrations effective for apoptosis inhibition ( Fig - ure S3B ) . Consistent with these Western blot results , a strong im - munostaining signal for phosphorylated MLC2 was observed in dissociated hESCs and was diminished by Y - 27632 ( Figure 2D , top ) and by RNAi knockdown of ROCK - I / II ( Figure 2E ) . These observations indicate that the dissociation of hESC induces a quick and substantial increase in pMLC2 in a Rho / ROCK - dependent manner . The phosphorylation of MLC2 is known to activate myosin and to create intracellular contractive forces via the actomyosin network ( Charras and Paluch , 2008 ) . Treatment with the myosin inhibitor Blebbistatin rescued dissociated hESCs from not only Figure 2 .

As a result , the Blebbistatin treatment signiﬁcantly increased the colony formation efﬁciency in the hESC dissociation culture ( Figures 2I and 2J ) . In addition , treat - ment with cytochalasin D ( an inhibitor of actin polymerization ) also attenuated both blebbing and apoptosis in dissociated hESCs ( Figures S3C – S3F ; MLC2 phosphorylation was unaf - fected , Figure S3F ) , suggesting that the actin - myosin interaction is indispensable for the early - onset cell death .

See also Movie S2 . stream of ROCK plays an essential role in the dissociation - induced cell death of hESCs . Consistent with this idea , similar sup - pression of both blebbing and apoptosis was observed in dissociated hESCs in which the myosin function was inhibited by overexpressing a dominant - negative MLC2 ( MLC2 - AA : nonphosphorylatable form ; Figures S3G – S3I ) or by shRNAs for nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA / IIC ( or myh9 / 14 ; Figures S3J – S3L ) . In contrast to Blebbistatin treatment , the MLCK inhibitor ML - 7 did not show sub - stantial suppressing effects on dissocia - tion - induced apoptosis even at high con - centrations ( e . g . , 20 m M ; Figure S3M ) , suggesting that MLCK is not an essential downstream mediator of ROCK in this particular context ( multiple ROCK targets are discussed in Riento and Ridley , 2003 ) . To examine the role of blebbing in apoptosis , we next overexpressed a constitutively active Ezrin ( EzrinT567D ) , which physically strengthens the link between the plasma membrane and the actomyosin cortex and thereby speciﬁ - cally reduces blebbing ( Charras et al . , 2006 ) . The overexpression of EzrinT567D did not affect the high level of pMLC2 accumula - tion in the dissociated hESC ( Figure 3A ; the overexpressing cells are indicated by coexpressing GFP ) . However , EzrinT567D strongly inhibited the blebbing , which then occurred only during the terminal stage of apoptosis when Caspase - 3 was strongly activated ( Figures 3B – 3D , Movie S2 , part D ) . In contrast to the efﬁcient suppression of blebbing , EzrinT567D did not substan - tially inhibit the dissociation - induced apoptosis ( Figure 3E , lane 3 ; lane 2 positive control with Bcl - X L ) . These ﬁndings of uncoupling between apoptosis and blebbing indicated that the Cell Stem Cell Mechanism of Dissociated - Induced Apoptosis in hESCs 230 Cell Stem Cell 7 , 225 – 239 , August 6 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . early - onset blebbing is not a direct cause of cell death but rather a parallel phenomenon induced by myosin hyperactivation . ROCK / Myosin Hyperactivation as well as Rho Activation Is Induced by the Loss of Ca 2 + - Dependent Intercellular Adhesion between hESCs Unlike ICM - like mESCs , hESCs exhibit an epithelial character with a clear apico - basal polarity ( Krtolica et al . , 2007 ; e . g . , apical junctions and a basement membrane ) as does the epiblast . A typical form of dissociation - induced apoptosis of epithelial cells is anoikis , which is caused speciﬁcally by the loss of cellular adhesion ( anchorage ) to a substrate or the basement membrane ( Frisch and Screaton , 2001 ) . We and others previously guessed that the dissociation - induced hESC apoptosis was probably also anoikis ( Watanabe et al . , 2007 ; Krawetz et al . , 2009 ) . However , we noticed in our live - imaging analysis that , although the disso - ciated hESCs successfully attached to the substrate matrix , the cells still underwent massive blebbing and apoptosis , arguing the hypothesis that this cell death is anoikis . The nonanoikis nature was further supported by our immunostaining data of dissociated hESC that clearly showed the formation of paxillin + focal adhesions onto the culture substrate , demonstrating the presence of the cell - substrate anchorage ( Figure S4A ; also see the accumulation of phospho - tyronsine and phospho - FAK , indicative of local integrin - related signaling ) . Therefore , we next examined the role of cell - cell adhesion in the control of the hESC apoptosis . In this case , we ﬁrst cultured the hESC in colonies so that the cells formed tight intercellular adhesion via the cadherin / catenin system involving E - cadherin ( Figures 4A – 4C ) . We then added the Ca 2 + chelator EGTA , which disrupts the cadherin - mediated cell attachment , and caused hESC to detach from one another but not from the plate bottom ( Figures 4D – 4F ) . Importantly , this dissociation without substrate detachment was sufﬁcient to increase the level of pMLC2 ( Fig - ure 4G , lane 2 ) in a ROCK - dependent manner ( lane 3 ) . Live imaging showed that the EGTA - induced mild dissociation was sufﬁcient to induce blebbing in a major population of hESCs , particularly at the periphery of the colonies , where the cellular dissociation by EGTA was most evident ( Figure 4H and Movie S3 , part A ; under this mild dissociation condition , the blebbing typically started 20 – 40 min after dissociation ) . Y - 27632 treat - ment reduced both the blebbing ( Figure 4I and Movie S3 , part B ) and also the apoptosis induced by EGTA ( Figure 4J , lane 2 ) . The Ca 2 + depletion - induced blebbing was suppressed when cell adhesion was restored by adding Ca 2 + back to the medium ( Figure 4K ) . In contrast , cells pretreated with the E - cadherin - blocking antibody remained separated even after Ca 2 + was added back . These cells continued to show blebbing even in the presence of Ca 2 + ( Figure 4L ) and exhibited a higher rate of apoptosis ( Figure S4B , lane 3 ) . These ﬁndings indicated that the continuous loss of E - Cadherin - dependent intercellular adhe - sion ( not of Ca 2 + ) is responsible for the blebbing and the cell death . Consistent with this idea , RNAi knockdown of E - cadherin sufﬁciently induced blebbing and apoptosis even in hESCs present in colonies ( Figures S4C – S4F and Movie S3 , part C ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings show that , although some minor contribution of anoikis is not totally excluded , the loss of E - cad - herin - dependent intercellular adhesion plays a major decisive role in the apoptosis in dissociated hESCs . We next performed a FRET analysis ( using Rho - Raichu ; Yosh - izaki et al . , 2003 ) to analyze the early response of Rho to the cellular dissociation by EGTA treatment . Consistent with the western blot study of the dissociation culture ( Figure 2A , lane 1 ) , the level of Rho activation was low before EGTA treat - ment ( Figure 4M ; blue ) but substantially increased soon after the addition of the chelator to the medium ( red in the cell periphery ; this FRET probe has a membrane - anchor motif ) . This activation clearly preceded the onset of blebbing ( Movie S4 ) , indicating that Rho activation was not induced by blebbing . These observations showed that Rho activation is an early event occurring prior to the myosin hyperactivation in hESC . The ROCK / Myosin Hyperactivation Occurs in an Epiblast State - Speciﬁc Manner One fundamental question about the dissociation - induced hESC apoptosis is why it occurs only in hESCs and not in mESCs . Recently , it was reported that mouse epiblast - derived pluripo - tent stem cells ( mEpiSCs ) behave more like hESCs than ICM - derived mESCs do ( Brons et al . , 2007 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . We therefore examined the effect of the EGTA treatment on mEpiSC . Interestingly , in contrast to mESCs ( Figure 1F ) , mEpiSCs started blebbing soon after dissociation ( Figure 4N , Figure S5A and Movie S5 , part A ) , and the blebbing was suppressed by Y - 27632 ( Figure S5B and Movie S5 , part B ) . In addition , the dissociation of mEpiSC causes a higher rate of Y - 27632 - sensi - tive apoptosis than did that of mESCs ( Figure S5C , lane 3 ) . These observations suggested that the difference in the vulnerability of pluripotent cells is more dependent on the cell state ( epiblast - like versus ICM - like ) , rather than on the species of origin ( human versus mouse ) . We next compared the activation state of Rho in different pluripotentcells . ThedissociationofmEpiSCs , butnotofmESCs , increased the level of active Rho ( Figure 4O , lane 4 ) . In addition , FRET analysis showed a rapid activation of Rho in mEpiSCs after their cellular disaggregation by EGTA ( data not shown ) . Thus , the mEpiSCs also resembled hESCs in the control of the Rho / ROCK pathway after dissociation , suggesting that the epiblast - like nature of hESCs is relevant to the dissociation - induced Rho / ROCK activation . In accordance with this idea , the dissociation culture of mouse epiblast cells ( primary culture from E6 . 25 embryos ) showed extensive blebbing that was sensitive to Y - 27632 ( Figures 4P and 4Q ; Figure S5D and Movie S5 , part C ) , indicating that a strong tendency for ROCK - myosin hyperactivation is common to epiblast - relatedcells , bothprimaryculturecellsandstemcelllines . Similar dissociation - induced blebbing is also seen in the epiblast - like cells ( E - cadherin + , Fgf5 + , Crypto + , and Klf4 (cid:3) ) generated from mESCs cultured for 2 days under differentiating conditions of SFEBq culture ( Eiraku et al . , 2008 ) ( unpublished data ) . Interest - ingly , the similar Y - 27632 - sensitive blebbing was seen in dissoci - atedectodermalcellsof Xenopus gastrulae ( MovieS6 ) , suggesting that the dissociation - induced ROCK / Myosin hypreactivation is a common phenomenon in vertebrate early ectodermal cells .

RT - PCR analysis revealed that at least 26 Rho - GEF family genes ( with a DH domain encoding , Rossman et al . , 2005 ) were expressed in hESC ( data not shown ) . We performed an shRNA - mediated knockdown screen focusing on genes with nonredundant structures and found that the knockdown of one Rho - GEF member ( Figures 5A and 5B , efﬁ - cient knockdown was also conﬁrmed by quantitative PCR , data not shown ) strongly rescued hESCs from the dissocia - tion - induced apoptosis ( Figure 5C , lanes 3 – 5 ; conﬁrmed with three independent shRNAs ) as efﬁciently as the knockdown of ROCK - I / II ( positive control ; lane 2 ) , and promoted colony forma - tion from dissociated hESCs ( Figures 5D and 5E ) . This Rho - GEF family molecule was Abr , which is structurally related to Bcr . In contrast to the well - known Bcr , whose fusion to Abl causes chronic myelogenous leukemia , relatively little is known about the role and function of Abr . Importantly , in addition to suppressing apoptosis , the knockdown of Abr markedly inhibited both the blebbing ( Figure 5F ) and the pMLC accumula - tion ( Figure 5G ; Abr - shRNA - expressing cells were marked by GFP ) after dissociation . These effects of Abr - shRNA were reversed by the coexpression of an shRNA - resistant codon - swapped Abr ( Figure 5H , lanes 2 and 4 ; lane 3 is a negative control using shRNA - sensitive wild - type Abr , which did not generate the gene product ) , supporting the speciﬁcity of the knockdown phenotype . These ﬁnding demonstrated that Abr - dependent ROCK / myosin activation plays a key role in trig - gering the downstream myosin hyperactivation and apoptosis of hESCs . Combinatory Rac Inhibition with Rho / ROCK Activation Plays a Crucial Role in Myosin Hyperactivation upon Dissociation of hESCs Given that two small G proteins , Rho and Rac , interact in the regulation of various cellular events ( positively and negatively ; Jaffe and Hall , 2005 ) , we next examined the control of Rac in hESCs . In a pull - down assay , the cell dissociation decreased the level of active Rac ( Figure 6A ) , in contrast to increased Rho activity ( Figure 2A ) . Consistent with this ﬁnding , in live FRET anal - ysis ( Rac - Raichu ; Itoh et al . , 2002 ) , whereas a substantial Rac activity was observed in hESCs before and immediately after the EGTA treatment , the Rac activity subsequently decreased down to a basal level ( Figure 6B ) . Similar Rac suppression upon dissociation was also observed in mEpiSCs ( data not shown ) . Thus , the regulation of Rac activity makes a clear differ - ence from that of Rho activity , which is low before dissociation and increases upon dissociation ( Figures 2A and 4M ) . These ﬁndings raised the possibility that Rho and Rac act in opposite directions in the dissociation - induced ROCK / myosin hyperactivation in hESCs . To test this idea , we introduced a constitutively active Rac ( caRac , Rac1V12 ) , which makes Rac activity persistently high , into hESC ( Figures 6C – 6F ) . It sup - pressed the blebbing movement ( Figure 6C , top ) and inhibited the activation of Caspase - 3 and the apoptosis ( Figures 6C – 6E ; Movie S7 ) . It also lowered the accumulation of pMLC in dissoci - ated hESCs ( Figure 6F ) . Thus , the persistent activation of Rac signaling has a clear inhibitory effect on the dissociation - induced ROCK - myosin hyperactivation . Interestingly , we found that this dissociation - induced Rho - high / Rac - low state was greatly altered in cells of a dissocia - tion - resistant hESC subclone reported previously ( subline 1 ; Hasegawa et al . , 2006 ) . Although these cells expressed hESC - speciﬁc markers and formed teratoma ( Figure S6A ) , they did not undergo blebbing or apoptosis in dissociation culture ( Figures S6B – S6D ) . Consistent with these ﬁndings , no substan - tial elevation of pMLC2 upon dissociation was observed ( Fig - ure S6E , lanes 5 and 6 ) . In pull - down assays , no substantial elevation of Rho activity was observed upon dissociation , whereas Rac activity was increased ( Figure S6F , lane 4 ) . These ﬁndings provide additional circumstantial evidence for the strong correlation between the Rho / Rac control and the dissociation - induced myosin hyperactivation . The involvement of the reciprocal Rho / Rac control was partic - ularly intriguing because one special structural feature of Abr is to contain a GAP ( inhibitor ) domain for Rho - class GTPases in addition to the typical GEF ( activator ; DH ) domain ( Figure 5A , top ; Heisterkamp et al . , 1993 ; Chuang et al . , 1995 ) . Previous studies have shown that the GAP domain of Abr preferentially binds to Rac ( and Cdc42 ) , but not to Rho , and has an inhibitory GAP activity for Rac , whereas the amino - terminal portion Figure 4 .

A mutant Abr in which two essential residues in the GAP domain were mutated ( Cho et al . , 2007 ; Figure 5A , bottom ) failed to rescue the dissociation - induced phenotypes of the Abr - shRNA hESC ( Figure 6H , lane 5 , bottom panel for control ) . Likewise , an Abr mutant lacking a Rho - GEF domain ( DH ; Figure 5A , middle row ) was unable to replace the wild - type Abr ( Figure 6H , lane 4 ) . These ﬁndings indicated that both the Rho - GEF and Rac - GAP domains are essential for Abr to induce the ROCK - dependent downstream events in dissociated hESCs . Consistent with this idea , neither Rho activation nor Rac inhi - bition was observed in Abr - depleted hESCs upon dissociation ( Figure 6I ) . Furthermore , the vulnerability to dissociation - induced apoptosis was almost fully restored in Abr - depleted hESCs when both caRho and dnRac ( or caROCK and dnRac ) were introduced , although the overexpression of each of them alone caused a substantial but only partial recovery ( Figures 7A – 7D ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings indicate that a biased Rho / Rac regulation ( high Rho and low Rac activity ) plays a crucial role for the induction of the ROCK / myosin hyperactivation in dissociated mammalian pluripotent cells . Figure 7E illustrates the summary of the apoptosis - inducing pathway elucidated in the present study . In nondissociated hESCs , the Rho / ROCK / pMLC system is kept low by an inhibitory mechanism dependent on the E - cadherin - mediated intercellular adhesion . Upon cell dissociation , this system becomes desup - pressed ( activated ) in an Abr - dependent manner . Rac is an antagonistic factor for the dissociation - induced activation of the Rho / ROCK / myosin system . However , in dissociated hESCs , the Rac - GAP function of Abr attenuates the antagonistic Rac function and facilitates a unilateral augmentation of the s hLa c Z s h A b r ( A ) s h A b r ( B ) s h A b r ( C ) s h R O C K - I / II 0hr 6hr % apop t o s i s s hLa c Z s h A b r ( A ) % b l ebb i ng 0 80 20 60 100 40 80 20 60 100 40 0 0hr 6hr % apop t o s i s 0 80 20 60 100 40 GFP / pMLC2 / DAPI A C E F shLacZ shAbr ( A ) Abr ( WT ) Abr * + + + + + + s h R O C K - I / II 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 Flag H sc 70 A b r s hLa c Z s h A b r ( A ) s h A b r ( B ) s h A b r ( C ) 1 2 3 4 D DH PH C2 GAP Abr Abr D DH PH C2 GAP Abr ( RA / NA ) DH PH C2 GAP B shLacZ shAbr ( A ) AP - po s i t i v e c o l on i e s 0 80 20 60 100 40 s hLa c Z s h A b r ( A ) H 1 2 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * n . s . shLacZ shAbr ( A ) G Figure 5 .

Interest - ingly , we observed in our preliminary study that Rac inhibition ( by dnRac ) combined with Rho activation ( by caRho ) induced Y - 27632 - sensitive blebbing movements even in dissociated mESC ( Figures S5E and S5F ) , suggesting that the reciprocal control of Rho / Rac can induce ROCK - Myosin hyperactivation at least to some extent in non - epiblast - like cells . So far , we do not have experimental evidence showing Abr’s direct interaction with the E - cadherin - catenin complex . Unlike catenins , Abr did not substantially bind E - cadherin ( Figure S7A ) . In addition , simple activation of E - cadherin alone ( by culturing hESCs on E - cadherin - protein - coated dishes ) appeared to be insufﬁcient to attenuate blebbing or apoptosis ( Figures S7B – S7E ) . These observations imply that Abr is controlled by a third factor that acts downstream of E - cadherin - dependent intercel - lular adhesion . We deduce that the dissociation - induced apoptosis may be antagonized to some extent by the PI3K - Akt pathway ( Down - ward , 2004 ) , which can be activated by various extrinsic signals including Fgf and extracellular matrix / integrin , both are essential for hESC culture . The inhibitors of the PI3K - Akt pathway ( e . g . , LY - 294002 ) facilitated the apoptosis in dissociated hESCs ( Fig - ure S7F ) . Conversely , the overexpression of a constitutively active Akt ( caAkt ) at least partially reduced the dissociation - inducedapoptosis withoutinterferingwithblebbing ( Figure S7G ) , suggesting that PI3K - Akt signaling can negatively modulate the apoptotic signal downstream of the myosin hyperactivation . Westernblotanalysisshowedthatdissociationinducesagradual accumulation of phosphorylated ( active ) Akt in hESCs ( Fig - ure S7H ) . This accumulation of active Akt may help delay the onset of cell death . The contribution of the active Akt to the strong resistance of mESCs is worth analyzing in - depth , given that both Eras ( strongly expressed in mouse pluripotent stem cells , but not in hESCs ; Takahashi et al . , 2003 ; Kameda and Thomson , 2005 ) and LIF can activate the PI3K pathway . DISCUSSION Myosin Hyperactivation Is the Direct Cause of the Early - Onset Apoptosis of hESCs In this study , we ﬁrst revealed that an unregulated activation of the actin - myosin system is the cause for the cell death of isolated hESCs . The myosin hyperactivation per se , not the blebbing , directly leads to the apoptosis . In other words , although the bleb - bing is like a ‘‘death dance’’ preceding the suicide of a solitary hESC , it is an epiphenomenon and not the actual trigger for death . An important question to be addressed in future investi - gations is how the information of myosin hyperactivation is trans - duced to the mitochondria . The present study also showed that cytochalasin D treatment prevented dissociated hESCs from undergoing early - onset apoptosis without inhibiting the pMLC2 accumulation , indicating that the hyperactivation of the actomy - osin system , rather than elevated activity of myosin per se , is essential for the apoptosis induction . One model for the induction mechanism is that the actomyosin hyperactivation nonspeciﬁcally augments intracellular stress , which is shown to trigger apoptosis via stress - responsive apoptotic pathways . Two typical apoptosis - inducing factors related to cellular stress responses are MAPKs ( e . g . , JNK ; Chang and Karin , 2001 ) and p53 ( Vousden and Lane , 2007 ) , which are known to act upstream of the Bcl / Bax family . However , we have so far obtained no evidence for the involvement of these two typical apoptosis inducers in the hESC apoptosis ( unpub - lished data ) . For instance , the dissociation of hESCs did not increase the level of phosphorylated JNK , and the MAPK inhibi - tors ( SP600125 and SB203580 ) had little effects on the dissoci - ation - induced apoptosis . Similarly , no signiﬁcant increase in p53 was induced by hESC dissociation , and the overexpression of Mdm2 , an inhibitor ( ubiquitin ligase ) of p53 , failed to inhibit the apoptosis . A second possibility is that the apoptosis is caused by the excessive energy consumption by the actomyosin hyperactiva - tion . With this in mind , we measured the ATP content in dissoci - ated hESCs . We found no substantial decrease of the ATP level in the Annexin V (cid:3) cell population even 5 hr after dissociation ( although most cells started blebbing soon after dissociation ; Figure 1G ) , arguing against the idea that the apoptosis of disso - ciated hESCs is due to an excessive consumption of intracellular energy ( data not shown ) . A third interpretation is that the augmented physical tension within the actomyosin cytoskeleton itself triggers the activa - tion of the mitochondrial pathway , for instance , by controlling the subcellular localization of apoptosis - inducing proteins in a tension - dependent fashion . This is certainly an attractive hypothesis to be tested systematically in future investigation . The present study focused on the molecular mechanism of the early culture period ( < 2 days ) of hESC apoptosis . During this time , in addition to Y - 27632 , the Caspase inhibitor zVAD also effectively suppressed the early - onset apoptotic reaction ( Figure 1A ) . Interestingly , however , although Y - 27632 and Bleb - bistatin ( Figure S1A and Figure 2I ) fully enable the survival of dissociated hESCs for a long time ( > 2 days ) , continuous zVAD treatment only partially supports the long - term survival ( Wata - nabe et al . , 2007 ) , suggesting the precence of a minor Cas - pase - independent pathway that also lies downstream of the ROCK - myosin hyperactivation for efﬁcient long - term survival . Upstream Regulation of the Dissociation - Induced ROCK / Myosin Hyperactivation in hESCs In the context of dissociation - induced ROCK / myosin hyperacti - vation , the two small GTPases Rho and Rac seem mutually antagonistic in function . For instance , the overexpression of caRac effectively inhibited the blebbing of hESCs . The data in the present study suggest at least two aspects of Rac’s antago - nistic functions in dissociated hESCs . First , overexpression of caRac attenuated the elevation of Rho activity in dissociated hESC ( Figure S6G , top row ) , consistent with previous reports on mutual inhibition of Rho and Rac ( Burridge and Wennerberg , 2004 ) . Second , Rac may also play an inhibitory role at more downstream levels . When coexpressed with caRho or caROCK , dnRac further increased apoptosis in dissociation culture of Abr - depleted hESCs ( Figures 7A – 7D ) . These ﬁndings suggest that Rac inhibition plays an effective role even under the condition of forced Rho - ROCK activation .

Abr is required for both the dissociation - induced myosin hyperacti - vation and the apoptosis in hESCs . However , given that Abr is expressed both in hESCs and mESCs ( data not shown ) , just the presence or absence of Abr in the cell is unlikely to determine the differential vulnerability of the mammalian ESCs , suggesting that the upstream regulation of Abr’s function , rather than its expression , plays a key role . How the function of Abr is differen - tially regulated in attached and dissociated cells at the molecular level is an open question for future investigation . Possible Biological Roles of the ROCK / Myosin Hyperactivation and Apoptosis In vivo , the cells in the ICM of the preimplantation embryo are not polarized and form a simple cell mass with no epithelialization ( Rossant and Tam , 2009 ) . After implantation , the pluripotent cells derived from the ICM become epithelialized and form an epiblast tissue with a clear apico - basal polarity , including the appearance of a basement membrane and tight junctions ( Krtolica et al . , 2007 ) . During this process , cells that do not contribute to the epiblast undergo apoptosis , forming a cavity in the center . One possible role of the dissociation - induced apoptosis is the quality control of the epiblast tissue formation in the postimplan - tation embryo , in other words , elimination of those ICM - derived cells that fail to be incorporated into the epiblast cell sheet . Another intriguing possibility is that the hyperactive state of the ROCK / myosin system in vivo is related more to morphogenesis rather than to cell survival . The process by which the ICM ( a simple cell mass ) is reshaped into the epiblast ( a cell sheet ) involves a dramatic 3D rearrangement of cells that requires high cell motility . The hyperactivity of the ROCK / myosin system may enable the epiblast - stage cells to prepare to undergo rapid cell movement . Consistent with this idea , recent studies have identiﬁed a novel type of Rho - ROCK - dependent blebbing ( or myosin hyperactivation ) that is used as a driving tool for directed migration of cells in 3D culture ( Sanz - Moreno et al . , 2008 ; Char - ras and Paluch , 2008 ) . Finally , another stimulating open question regarding the cell - state - speciﬁc ROCK / myosin hyperactivation is whether this phenomenon is limited to the early embryonic cells of mamma - lian species . In the Xenopus embryo , the inner layer cells of the blastula animal cap are equivalent to mouse ICM cells . They are pluripotent and form the animal pole roof lining the blasto - coel , but do not have evident apico - basal polarity ( e . g . , no base - ment membrane ) . These cells become epithelialized during early gastrulation upon their fate speciﬁcation into the ectoderm lineage . Importantly , the dissociated Xenopus gastrulae ecto - dermal cells also exhibit blebbing ( Johnson , 1976 ) in a ROCK - dependent manner ( Movie S6 ) , implying the possibility that the ‘‘hyperactivation’’ - ready nature of epiblast / early - ectoderm cells has a profound biological role across species in the reproducible formation of the ﬁrst - born epithelial structure in vertebrate ontogeny . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture The hESCs ( KhES - 1 , KhES - 3 ) were used in accordance with the hESC guide - lines of the Japanese government . Five hiPSCs ( gift from Y . Nakamura and S . Yamanaka ) were also tested and similar observations were made . Undiffer - entiated hESCs and its subline 1 were maintained as described previously ( Hasegawa et al . , 2006 : Watanabe et al . , 2007 ) . Additional details are in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Plasmids and Transfection PCR - ampliﬁed cDNAs was sequenced and subcloned into the pCAG - IP or pCAG - IG expression vector . FRET probes for Caspases ( SCAT3 and SCAT9 ) and Rho proteins ( Rho - Raichu and Rac - Raichu ) were kindly provided by M . Miura ( University of Tokyo ) and M . Matsuda ( Kyoto University ) , respec - tively . The pSIREN RNAi system ( Clontech ) was used for knocking down the expression of speciﬁc genes . The transfection of hESC with cDNA - or shRNA - expressionplasmidswasperformedwiththeFuGENEHDtransfection reagent ( Roche ) . Additional information was in Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Biochemical Analyses For the evaluation of apoptosis , cells were stained with ﬂuorescence - conju - gated Annexin - V / Propidium Iodide ( Biovision ) and ﬂow cytometric analysis was performed with FACSAria ( BD Biosciences ) . Immunostaining and colony formation assay was performed as described previously ( Watanabe et al . , 2007 ; Eiraku et al . , 2008 ) . The Rho / Rac activity was evaluated with a GST pull - down assay with MLB solution , Rhotekin - RBD , and Pak1 - RBD ( Upstate ) . For the detection of protein expression , cell lysates were made in RIPA lysis buffer . For dissection of protein - protein interaction , cell lysates were made in NT lysis buffer and immunoprecipitation was performed as described before . The cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and sequential western blotting . Antibodies used in this study were shown in Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Live Imaging For thelive single - cell imaging , dissociated cells wereseededonto aMatrigel - coated35mmglass - bottomdish . Therecordingwasstartedat15minafterthe ﬁrst contact with the dissociation reagent . For the EGTA experiments , cell clumpsmaintainedonafeederlayeroraMatrigel - coated35mmglass - bottom dish for a few days were used for imaging . In this case , the recording was started when EGTA was added to the culture medium . For confocal observa - tion , the images were collected with a CSU - X1 unit ( Yokogawa ) conﬁgured with an IX81 - ZDC microscope ( Olympus ) . The ratiometric analyses were per - formed with MetaMorph 7 . 5 ( Molecular Devices ) . Statistical Analysis Error bars shown in the ﬁgures represent standard deviations and n in the legends is the number of experiments . Statistical signiﬁcance ( two - sided ) was tested by a Student’s t test for two - group comparison , and by the one - way ANOVA for multiple - group comparison ( for Annexin - V staining analysis , samples at the 6 hr point were analyzed unless otherwise mentioned ) with a post - hoc Tukey’s ( among all groups ) or Dunnett’s test ( versus control ) with the Prism 4 program ( GraphPad ) .
