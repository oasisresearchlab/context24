The outer KT consists of the KMN network , a protein super - complex comprising Knl1 ( yeast Spc105 ) , Mis12 ( yeast Mtw1 ) , and Ndc80 ( yeast Ndc80 ) , which harbours sites for MT binding . Within the KMN network , Spc105 acts as an interaction hub of components involved in spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) signalling . It is known that Spc105 forms a complex with KT component Kre28 . However , where Kre28 physically localizes in the budding yeast KT is not clear . The exact function of Kre28 at the KT is also unknown . Here , we investigate how Spc105 and Kre28 interact and how they are organized within bioriented yeast KTs using genetics and cell biological experiments . Our microscopy data show that Spc105 and Kre28 localize at the KT with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry . We also show that the Kre28 – Spc105 interaction is important for Spc105 protein turn - over and essential for their mutual recruitment at the KTs . We created several truncation mutants of kre28 that affect Spc105 loading at the KTs . When over - expressed , these mutants sustain the cell viability , but SAC signal - ling and KT biorientation are impaired . Therefore , we conclude that Kre28 contributes to chromosome biorientation and high - fidelity segregation at least indirectly by regulating Spc105 localization at the KTs . 1 . Introduction During eukaryotic cell division , kinetochores ( KTs ) facilitate faithful segre - gation of genetic material from mother to daughter cells . Each KT is a large protein machine that assembles on a specialized chromatin domain called the centromere and establishes end - on attachments between the sister chromatids and spindle MTs emanating from opposite spindle poles . The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has one of the ‘ simplest ’ KTs known to date , yet it har - bours approximately 70 protein subunits . Components of the yeast KT can be divided into two main categories . The first category contains the centromeric DNA - binding components and their associated network known as CCAN ( con - stitutive centromere - associated network ) . The second comprises the MT - binding protein network : the KMN super - complex , the fungi - specific Dam1 complex and the MT plus - end - binding protein Stu2 [ 1 – 5 ] . The budding yeast KT incorporates each of these proteins positioned at well - defined average locations along with the KT - MT attachment ( figure 1 a ; electronic supplemen - tary material , figure S1B ) [ 7 , 8 ] . For molecular and cell biologists , the budding yeast KT serves as an excellent model to determine the mechanisms underlying KT functions . Spc105 is an essential KT protein that gets co - purified with the COMA com - plex subunit Mcm21 and with the MIND complex ( Mtw1 - Nsl1 - Nnf1 - Dsn1 ) [ 9 , 10 ] . It forms a complex with another essential KT protein , Kre28 , also known as Ydr532C . Kre28 is an orthologue of human Zwint1 , C . elegans Kbp - 5 and S . pombe Sos7 [ 10 – 13 ] .

Still , the specific function of Kre28 remains unclear . How Kre28 localizes within the KT - MT attachment site is also unknown [ 14 – 16 ] . Here we define the localization of Kre28 in KT - MT attachment sites of bioriented KTs and elucidate its functional role . 2 . Results 2 . 1 . Localization of Kre28 in the KMN network of bioriented kinetochores We have previously shown that the precise organization and alignment of Spc105 can influence proper spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) activation and silencing [ 17 – 20 ] . Kre28 , being an essential component of the KT , may also contribute to the organization of Spc105 into the yeast KT . Zwint1 , the human orthologue of Kre28 , localizes very close to Cdc20 at the human KTs [ 21 , 22 ] . Therefore , Kre28 may play a role in determining the Spc105 organization . To determine Kre28 ’ s position with respect to Spc105 , we first had to define the organization of the entire Spc105 protein within the yeast KT . Previous studies show that the C - terminal RWD domain of Spc105 binds directly to the Mtw1 complex and remains in the proximity of Spc24 / Spc25 C - termini [ 15 , 23 , 24 ] . On the other hand , the N - termi - nus of Spc105 ( abbreviated as N - Spc105 ) consists of a long , disordered phosphodomain that lies somewhere between the Dam1 complex and the C - termini of Ndc80 and Nuf2 within the Ndc80 complex [ 6 – 8 ] . To map out the overall organization of the Spc105 phosphodomain , we inserted a GFP at locations within Spc105 that demarcate domains predicted to possess secondary structure ( see electronic sup - plementary material , figure S1 ) . Additionally , we tagged three different KT subunits to position mCherry at different locations along with the KT - MT attachment ( electronic sup - plementary material , figure S1 ) . Quantification of FRET between the GFP inserted in Spc105 and one of the three mCherry acceptors shows that despite being discorded , the Spc105 phosphodomain localization is mainly limited to a span between the Dam1 complex and the C - terminus of the Ndc80 subunit ( abbreviated at Ndc80 - C ) of the Ndc80 com - plex . The disordered nature of the phosphodomain also gave rise to FRET between different sections of adjacent Spc105 molecules ( electronic supplementary material , figure S1D ) . Having established Spc105 , we examined the localiz - ation of Kre28 by centroid measurement and FRET assay . Previous literature suggested that the C - terminal structured domains of Spc105 harbour interaction sites for Kre28 [ 22 , 25 ] . To define the localization of Kre28 within the KMN net - work of bioriented KTs , we performed high - resolution colocalization to measure the mean separation between Kre28 - C and the N termini of the Ndc80 subunit ( N - Ndc80 ) in the bioriented KTs of yeast ( figure 1 a ) [ 8 ] . We observed that the C - terminus of Kre28 is positioned between 45 and 50 nm from N - Ndc80 , which is consistent with previously published work with Zwint1 [ 22 ] . To determine Kre28 localization with higher resolution , we quantified FRET between Kre28 - C with either Spc24 - C or Ndc80 - C in metaphase cells . We obtained a low to moder - ate proximity ratio in both cases , indicating that Kre28 - C may localize somewhere between C - termini of Spc24 and Ndc80 ( figure 1 b ) . The absence of FRET between adjacent Kre28 C termini ( Kre28 - GFP / Kre28 - mCherry ) indicated that the C termini of Kre28 molecules are farther apart than 10 nm in metaphase ( figure 1 c ) . We also measured FRET between Kre28 - mCherry and GFP inserted at different positions of Spc105 ( 222nd , 455th , 709th , or the C terminus ) to find that the C termini of Kre28 are proximal of the KT - binding RWD domain ( RING finger , WD repeat , DEAD - like heli - cases ) of Spc105 ( figure 1 d , e ) . A previous study suggested that the stoichiometry of Kre28 and Spc105 is 2 : 1 [ 12 ] . However , a comparison of the intensity of Kre28 - GFP or Kre28 - mCherry signal per KT revealed that there is one mol - ecule of Kre28 per Spc105 molecule in bioriented KTs of yeast ( electronic supplementary material , figure S2A – D ) . 2 . 2 . Interaction of Kre28 with coiled coil domain of Spc105 Studies of Zwint1 ( orthologue of Kre28 in humans ) found that it interacts with a domain within amino acid 1980 – 2109 of human Spc105 [ 25 ] . Protein cross - linking experiments also revealed that coiled - coiled domains ( CCs ) Kre28 128 – 169 and Kre28 229 – 259 interact with Spc105 551 – 711 , the predicted CC of Spc105 [ 14 ] . We wanted to uncover the domains within both Kre28 and Spc105 that are necessary for their mutual interactions . To study these domains in the ex - vivo condition , we first used the yeast two - hybrid assay . We chose Kre28 fragments ( amino acid 1 – 201 and 202 – 385 , based on predicted second - ary structure of Kre28 , http : / / www . compbio . dundee . ac . uk / jpred4 / index _ up . html ) and Spc105 CC ( 455 – 708 ) and the C - terminal RWD domain of Spc105 ( amino acid 709 – 917 [ 15 ] ; see also electronic supplementary material , figure S3A ) . Both Kre28 FL and Kre28 1 – 201 showed interactions with CC as indicated by the growth of colonies co - expressing GBD + spc105 CC , GAD + Kre28 FL , and GBD + spc105 CC , GAD + kre28 1 – 201 in synthetic dextrose plates lacking histidine . Interest - ingly , we did not see any interactions between Kre28 FL and spc105 CC + RWD ( figure 2 a ) . This may be because of the misfold - ing of spc105 CC + RWD fusion with the GAL4 - binding domain ( GBD _ C1 ) . It is also possible that the RWD domain interferes with the interaction of CC and Kre28 , pointing to a regulatory mechanism . To dissect the interaction between spc105 CC and kre28 1 – 201 more thoroughly , we used smaller fragments ( 1 – 126 and 1 – 80 ) for our yeast two - hybrid assay with spc105 CC . We did not notice any interaction using these combinations ( figure 2 a ) . Furthermore , we saw a significant contrast in colony growth between the combinations of spc105 CC + Kre28 FL and that of spc105 CC + kre28 1 – 201 , which denotes a change in the strength of interaction with spc105 CC . In con - clusion , our yeast two - hybrid assay data indicated that Spc105 CC binding domain lies within Kre28 127 – 201 . Next , we mapped the Kre28 interacting domain of Spc105 in vivo . We performed domain mapping experiments where we truncated the mid strand domain of Spc105 ( amino acid 313 – 708 ) at different residues based on predicted secondary structure ( figure 2 b ) . We constructed versions of GFP - labelled Spc105 with different truncations in the mid strand domain ( Δ 313 – 455 harbouring only the unstructured region , Δ 313 – 507 containing unstructured region and a small helical domain , Δ 313 – 638 that contains unstructured region and an alpha helix - rich domain of CC and Δ 313 – 709 that r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o b O p e n B i o l . 12 : 210274 3 encompasses the entire mid strand domain , figure 2 b top right ) and transformed them in a heterozygous diploid strain ( AJY3278 , SPC105 / Δ : : NAT ) . We examined the localiz - ation of these mutants by microscopy . First , KT localization of Δ 313 – 455 and Δ 313 – 507 displayed no discernable differ - ence in localization compared to wild - type ( figure 2 b , right ) . Our nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) analyses ( nls - mapper . iab . keio . ac . jp / cgi - bin / NLS _ Mapper _ y . cgi ; see Material and methods section ) indicated residues of 337 – 345 ( SSNKRRKLD , score 9 . 0 ) and / or that of 599N - 625L ( score 6 . 9 ) contain NLSs .

There - fore , this region of 313 – 507 is not essential for the KT localization of Spc105 . Truncation of 313 – 638 or 313 – 709 com - pletely abrogated KT localization of Spc105 . According to our analysis , spc105 599 – 625 may harbour an NLS , and deletion of this signal may have abrogated KT localization of the mutants expressing spc105 Δ 313 – 638 or spc105 Δ 313 – 709 . We introduced SV40 - NLS ( NLS SV40 ) at the N - terminus of spc105 Δ 313 – 638 : : GFP to check if nuclear localization of this mutant rescues its loading at the KTs ( figure 2 b , bottom left ) . However , we did not observe any KT - specific localization . Subsequently , we wanted to check whether these trunca - tion mutants can support cell viability . To address this , we induced sporulation / meiosis in heterozygous diploid strains expressing these truncated molecules of spc105 ( Δ 313 – 455 or Δ 313 – 507 ) . We observed that they were able to complement the deletion of endogenous SPC105 ( spc105 Δ ) . We can con - clude that the domain of 313 – 507 is not essential for any activity of Spc105 that contributes to cell viability . On the contrary , Spc105 mutants with either 313 – 638 or 313 – 709 truncated could not rescue the viability of spc105 Δ . Even fusion of SV40 - NLS ( NLS SV40 ) at the N - terminus of spc105 Δ 313 – 638 did not rescue its ability to support the cell via - bility in the absence of wild - type Spc105 ( figure 2 b right and bottom left ) . This dataset reveals that the proper localization of Spc105 at the KT is essential for its proper function . They also infer that the lack of nuclear localization cannot explain the lethality of the ( spc105 Δ 313 – 638 ) mutant . We confirmed these observations using the plasmid - shuf - fle assay ( data not shown ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that the domain of Spc105 housed within amino acid 507 – 638 directly interacts with Kre28 . Deletion of this domain abro - gates the interaction resulting in delocalization of Spc105 from the KTs . To biochemically confirm the results of the 2 - hybrid and localization experiments , we immunoprecipitated GFP - labelled versions of Spc105 from strains expressing either Spc105 455 : : GFP ( FL ) or spc105 Δ 313 – 638 : : GFP ( Δ 313 – 638 ) and examined if both molecules interact with Kre28 ( figure 2 c ) . Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis demonstrated that even though Spc105 455 : : GFP binds Kre28 - 5xFlag , the mutant of spc105 Δ 313 – 638 : : GFP is unable to do so , which indicates that a domain harboured within Spc105 507 – 638 is essential for its interaction with Kre28 and subsequently its recruitment at the KTs . 2 . 3 . Localization of truncation mutants of Kre28 and their ability to support cell viability Our yeast two - hybrid assay ( figure 2 a ) indicated that the Spc105 interacting domain of Kre28 lies within amino acid 127 – 201 of Kre28 . The predicted secondary structure of Kre28 FL showed that the aforesaid region of Kre28 is helix rich and structured ( figure 3 a , http : / / bioinf . cs . ucl . ac . uk / psipred , also see electronic supplementary material , figure S3A ) . To check which domain of Kre28 is essential for its loading at the KT and interaction with Spc105 , we created yeast strains that express GFP - fused Kre28 frag - ments from the ADH1 promoter . We examined their localization in a diploid yeast strain where one genomic copy of KRE28 is deleted , and the other allele is tagged with mCherry at its C - terminus ( figure 3 b ) . As expected , GFP - Kre28 FL localizes at the KT . On the contrary , we could not detect the localization of GFP - kre28 Δ 127 – 182 or fragments with larger truncations at the KTs . When over - expressed from pr ADH1 , GFP - fused versions of Kre28 FL and its truncations revealed a high cytoplasmic GFP signal ( figure 3 b ) . Therefore , we performed similar exper - iments with the SV40 - NLS at the C - terminus of GFP - kre28 Δ 127 – 182 . Even in this case , we did not see any KT local - ization ( data not shown ) . It should be noted that the GFP tagged Kre28 FL and its truncations were expressed at simi - lar levels ( figure 3 c ) . Does Kre28 delocalization affect the cell viability when yeast cells express the mutants in the absence of wild - type Kre28 ? To test this , we sporulated these diploid strains and isolated haploid spores . We observed that the segre - gants over - expressing truncated versions of kre28 rescued the deletion of endogenous KRE28 ( kre28 Δ ) . How - ever , the segregants expressing truncated kre28 molecules from their native promoter ( KRE28pr ) could not comp - lement genomic KRE28 deletion ( figure 3 d ) . These data indicate that full - length Kre28 is essential for binding with Spc105 and its interaction with the Mtw1 complex . However , truncated kre28 mutants with defective KT localization were able to sustain cell viability when over - expressed . We backcrossed viable spores with the parent strain ( YEF473 ) to avoid background mutations . The seg - regants isolated from those crosses were subjected to further experiments . Figure 2 .

Due to low expression , we could not detect Spc105 in the input samples . In the elute samples of both the strains , we observed some bands with lower molecular weight , likely due to the degradation of GFP - labelled Spc105 . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o b O p e n B i o l . 12 : 210274 5 2 . 4 . Truncation of Kre28 significantly reduces the recruitment of Spc105 at the kinetochore We observed slower colony growth among the segregants expressing only the kre28 truncation mutants ( figures 3 d and 5 b ) . The slow growth suggested that these mutants have a high propensity of chromosome missegregation , and this will affect their viability . Among these mutants , we chose kre28 Δ 127 – 182 for further analysis because this is the smallest truncation that has a significant defect in KT localiz - ation . To check whether kre28 Δ 127 – 182 affects the biorientation of sister KTs , we tagged Ndc80 and Spc105 individually with mCherry and studied KT biorientation in kre28 truncation mutant ( figure 4 a , b ) . We did not find any noticeable defects in the bipolar attachment of metaphase KTs in this mutant ( electronic supplementary material , figure S2F ) . However , we observed a significant decrease ( approx . 61 % ) in Spc105 recruitment in the truncation mutants ( figure 4 b ) with a much smaller change ( approx . 24 % ) in Ndc80 localization ( figure 4 a ) .

This quantification revealed that the amounts of KT localized Kre28 and Spc105 are mutually correlated . As the number of molecules of either protein per kinetochore increases , so does the number of molecules for the other . As expected , both numbers saturate at approximately 8 molecules per KT , which is close to the maximal number of Ndc80 complex molecules per yeast KT [ 27 ] . Given that Spc105 can localize to KTs even in strains over - expressing Kre28 fragments , these results strongly suggest that Kre28 positively contributes to Spc105 interactions with the Mtw1 complex . We also found that the number of Ndc80 molecules per KT was slightly lower in cells with KTs containing small numbers of Kre28 molecules ( figure 4 c ( iii ) ) . This result is consistent with our prior work , which showed that a reduction in Spc105 molecules per KT similarly lowers the number of Ndc80 molecules per KT [ 27 ] .

The dominant peak of the 4n in 3 h sample of mad2 Δ strain indicates checkpoint null phenotype . The assay was repeated twice . The presence of a more dominant 2 N peak even in untreated samples ( 0 h ) of strains expressing Kre28 FL may be due to the presence of centromeric plasmids , because yeast strains harbouring centromeric plasmids typically show a delay in mitosis .

To induce meiosis , the zygotes obtained from the crosses were first grown overnight in growth media and then transferred in sporulation media to be incubated for four 4 – 5 days . After that , tetrads from each sporulation cultures were dissected . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o b O p e n B i o l . 12 : 210274 8 Finally , we performed the immunoblot assay following RFP - trap experiments to assess the severity of impairment in the interaction between kre28 Δ 127 – 182 and Spc105 . We observed that the co - precipitation of kre28 Δ 127 – 182 with Spc105 - mCherry was significantly reduced ( approx . 40 % ; figure 4 d ; see the figure legend and Material and methods section for details of band intensity calculation and normali - zation ) . Moreover , we detected the protein level of Spc105 was reduced in the presence of kre28 Δ 127 – 182 ( approx . 69 % , figure 4 d , panel of anti - DsRed blot ) . This set of observations imply that the coiled domain Kre28 containing amino acid residue 127 – 182 plays a significant role in the binding of Kre28 and Spc105 . They also suggest that Kre28 plays a role the maintaining the stability of Spc105 protein . 2 . 5 . Effect of Kre28 truncation on spindle assembly checkpoint and error correction pathway Spc105 contains short linear interaction motifs known as MELT motifs that , when phosphorylated by the Mps1 kinase , serve as the scaffold for checkpoint components [ 17 , 18 ] . Moreover , the evolutionarily conserved RVSF motif present in the N - terminus of Spc105 acts as the primary bind - ing motif of protein phosphatase I ( PP1 ) that dephosphorylates the MELT repeats to silence the SAC [ 20 ] . Therefore , Spc105 delocalization may affect SAC activation and silencing . We first studied SAC signalling in cells over - expressing kre28 Δ 127 – 182 by treating cell cultures with the MT poison nocodazole and performing flow cytometry to quantify cellu - lar DNA content . The flow cytometry revealed that SAC strength was not discernably different in strains expressing Kre28 FL and kre28 Δ 127 – 182 , as indicated by the arrest of the cell population with 2 N DNA content ( figure 5 a ) . However , we have previously shown that this assay cannot detect smal - ler defects in SAC signalling [ 6 ] . To examine the efficacy to detect smaller defects in SAC and that of the error correction process in kre28 mutants , we subjected them to a low dose of another MT poison , benomyl . At its dosage used in this assay , benomyl destabilizes MTs and forces yeast cells to rely on a combination of effective error correction and SAC signalling to ensure chromosome biorientation and accurate chromo - some segregation [ 6 ] . The strains that express kre28 with larger truncations ( Δ 127 – 201 , Δ 1 – 201 , and Δ 1 – 126 ) demon - strated growth defects even in non - selective growth media ( YPD ) . We also performed the benomyl - sensitivity assay using a strain where SV40 - NLS is fused to Kre28 127 – 182 at the C - terminus . Fusion of NLS also did not alleviate the effect of kre28 truncation , suggesting that the afore - men - tioned phenotypes are not caused by delocalization of kre28 from the nucleus ( figure 5 b bottom ) . The growth defects of the kre28 truncation mutants in benomyl - contain - ing media strongly imply that their ability to activate a robust SAC and / or error correction pathway is compromised . Reduced Spc105 loading in the KT of these mutants can explain the observed deficiencies in SAC signalling , error cor - rection or both . Previous studies showed that the SAC is essential to ensure the fidelity of meiotic segregation [ 28 , 29 ] . Therefore , delocalization of kre28 may also result in defects in meiotic processes . To examine this aspect , we produced zygotes by crossing a and α haploid strains that over - express truncated kre28 in the absence of any wild - type Kre28 . However , these zygotes had severe growth defects ( figure 5 c ) . We did not find any nuclear fusion defects during mating of these haploid cells ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , when we sporu - lated these slow - growing homozygous diploid strains ( as shown in one of the panels of homozygosis in figure 5 c ) and dissected tetrads , we observed a significant decrease in the number of viable segregants ( figure 5 d , right panel ) . In control experiments , we did not observe any defects in het - erozygous diploid formation ( figure 5 c , left panel ) or the growth of viable segregants after subsequent sporulation ( figure 5 d , left panel ) . We have tabulated our observations for the truncation mutants of Kre28 , which we studied here ( table 1 ) . The observation of truncated kre28 mutants affect - ing meiosis in yeast is similar to what was previously observed in mouse oocyte meiosis [ 30 ] . 3 . Discussion Here we have elucidated how Spc105 and Kre28 are localized and aligned in the MT attachment sites of the bioriented KTs of budding yeast cells . Kre28 - C localizes approximately 48 nm away from the N - terminus of Ndc80 . This is consistent with observations reported previously with Zwint1 , the human orthologue of Kre28 [ 22 ] . Our FRET data are also in accordance with previously published biochemical and cell biological studies [ 14 , 15 , 22 ] . Interestingly , we could not deter - mine the FRET between Kre28 - C and components of the Mtw1 complex because strains expressing the fluorescent fusions were inviable . The fluorescent tags probably disrupt interactions between Spc105 / Kre28 and the Mtw1 complex , which results in synthetic lethality [ 14 ] . Most strikingly , we observed that the stoichiometry of Kre28 to Spc105 is 1 : 1 , whereas it was previously thought to be 2 : 1 [ 12 ] . Results of the yeast two - hybrid assays involving Kre28 FL and Spc105 455 – 709 were consistent with previously published data from Yanagida lab [ 15 , 25 ] . However , it was unclear why the yeast two - hybrid assay did not work between Kre28 FL and spc105 455 – 917 ( spc105 CC + RWD ) . It may be the case that CC + RWD ( Spc105 455 – 917 ) fusion with GAL4 - binding domain ( GBD _ C1 ) did not fold in a way that they can interact with Kre28 . On the other hand , it is also possible that RWD interfering with the binding of CC and Kre28 has an unknown physiological significance . Although we obtained yeast two - hybrid interaction between kre28 1 – 201 and spc105 455 – 709 , we did not detect any KT localization of kre28 1 – 201 . It was also not sufficient to support cell viability in the absence of wild - type Kre28 . Much to our surprise , even after taking the data of Herzog lab into consideration , when we maintained the two binding sites of Spc105 ( kre28 128 – 169 and kre28 229 – 259 ) in our kre28 cassette ( kre28 Δ 1 – 126 ) [ 14 ] , we did not see any KT localization . After consider - ing these data , we can conclude that full - length Kre28 is essential for its localization and for full KT recruitment of Spc105 . Despite being an essential and conserved component of the KT , the structure of Kre28 remains unknown , and the absence of a structure prevents a clear understanding of the implications of our data . Therefore , to provide a structural context to our interaction - mapping and KT localization experiments , we used an implementation of Alphafold2 to predict structures of protein complexes using Google r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o b O p e n B i o l . 12 : 210274 9 Colabfold ( https : / / colab . research . google . com / github / sok - rypton / ColabFold / blob / main / beta / AlphaFold2 _ advanced . ipynb [ 31 ] ) . Using Colabfold , we predicted the structure of a heterodimer of Kre28 FL and the C - terminal region of Spc105 451 – 917 ( electronic supplementary material , figure S3B ) . The N - terminal boundary of Spc105 used in the struc - ture prediction was chosen based on the start of the structured region within Spc105 . Alphafold predicts a ‘ T ’ shaped architecture for the Kre28 – Spc105 451 – 917 heterodimer with high confidence for most residues predicted to possess secondary structure ( scores 97 % - 23 % , electronic supplemen - tary material , figure S3B , C ) . The Pairwise Alignment Error matrix suggests with high confidence that extensive inter - actions occur among residues in the N - and C - terminal halves of the two proteins . These interactions give rise to two distinct domains within the heterodimer , but the rela - tive organization of these domains cannot be inferred ( electronic supplementary material , figure S3D ) . The struc - ture correlates very well with the CC predictions for Kre28 and Spc105 ( electronic supplementary material , figures S3A , S3E ) . It is also consistent with our limited FRET data . We detected significant and similar FRET between Kre28 - mCherry and either Spc105 709 : : GFP or Spc105 - GFP ( figure 1 ) . In the predicted structure , the separation between Kre28 - C and Spc105 709 and Spc105 - C is similar ( 4 . 6 nm and 4 . 8 nm , respectively , electronic supplementary material , figure S3F ) . Interestingly , we did not detect any FRET between Kre28 - mCherry and a Spc105 455 : : GFP , even though the model predicts a separation of 7 . 1 nm between these two points ( elec - tronic supplementary material , figure S3F ) . However , the model also predicts that the donor and acceptor fluorophores will be in two different domains , and the relative configuration of the two domains is unknown ( electronic supplementary material , figure S3D ) . Therefore , the actual separation between Kre28 - C and Spc105 455 is likely to be greater than 10 nm . The predicted model is also in agreement regarding the residues in Kre28 identified by a previous study to be critical in mediating its interaction with Spc105 [ 14 ] . In conclusion , the extensive interaction interface between the two proteins with involve - ment from residues over nearly the entire length of Kre28 predicted by the model can explain why we could not elimin - ate the interaction between Spc105 and Kre28 using extensive truncations in either protein . Our data of Spc105 protein becoming destabilized in the kre28 Δ 127 – 182 mutant ( figure 4 d , panel of anti - DsRed blot ) imply that impairment of Kre28 – Spc105 interaction signifi - cantly affects Spc105 integrity of expression . This implication is in accordance with a previously reported study by Zhang et al . [ 32 ] where they depleted Zwint1 by RNAi and demonstrated that the cellular protein level of hSpc105 is depleted . A study in the fission yeast S . pombe also revealed that KT proteins like Spc105 are surveilled by protein quality control machinery that includes Hsp70 , Bag102 , the 26S proteasome , Ubc4 , and the ubiquitin - ligases Ubr11 and San1 [ 33 ] . In that study , the authors suggested that cells employ this mechanism to maintain the homeosta - sis of nuclear components and genomic integrity . We came across another indirect evidence of protein quality regulation of Spc105 and Kre28 from Yong - Gonzales and colleagues [ 34 ] . They showed that both of these proteins become sumoy - lated by Smc5 - Smc6 complex and deleterious mutations in Smc5 - Smc6 complex leads to chromosome loss [ 34 ] . Consist - ent with the above - mentioned studies , the Biggins lab also T a b l e 1 .

A similar mechanism probably controls Spc105 and / or Kre28 levels in S . cerevisiae . Does Kre28 act as a chaperone to stabilize the recruit - ment of Spc105 at the KT ? Some of the previous studies argue against this hypothesis . In human KT , Zwint1 is dis - pensable for the interaction between hSpc105 and Mis12 complex [ 15 , 16 ] . While performing ex - vivo KT assembly experiments , Biggins lab showed that Ipl1 phosphorylation of Dsn1 , which triggers outer KT assembly , also recruits Kre28 , which should be specific to mitotic cells [ 36 ] . Con - trastingly , we observed a similar level of Kre28 at the KTs at every stage in the cell cycle , including the G1 - S phase ( unbudded and small budded cells , data not shown ) , which implies that Kre28 loading at the KT takes place at the same time point as loading of Spc105 . Combining our observations with those from Herzog lab , we can conclude that kre28 127 – 182 contributes to the main interaction between Kre28 and Spc105 and kre28 229 – 259 contributes to interaction with the Mtw1 complex . However , full - length Kre28 is essential for proper binding with Spc105 , their mutual recruitment and their activity at the KTs . Kre28 may also become phosphorylated by Ipl1 , which can trigger its association with Spc105 and subsequently their loading at the KTs . Does Kre28 have a specific function in SAC and error cor - rection or during meiosis ? The results of the functional assays ( figure 5 ) clearly show that the delocalization of Kre28 from the KT impairs the processes . However , all these phenotypes may be linked with the delocalization of Spc105 . A similar conclusion has been noted for Zwint1 [ 22 , 32 , 37 ] . Our exper - iment where we observed a significant number of inviable segregants after sporulation of homozygous diploid strains expressing only truncated kre28 ( kre28 Δ 127 – 182 ) are also in agreement with a study done by Dong Woo Seo and col - leagues [ 30 ] . According to that study , Zwint1 depletion results in erroneous chromosome alignment and a high fre - quency of aneuploidy during mice oocyte meiosis . Our study suggests that this function of Zwint1 is also conserved in yeast Kre28 . 4 . Material and methods 4 . 1 . Plasmid and strain construction The strains and plasmids used in this study are documented in tables 2 and 3 , respectively . Yeast strains containing mul - tiple genetic modifications were constructed by standard yeast genetic techniques . GFP ( S65T ) and mCherry fusion of proteins were used to localize KTs by fluorescence microscopy . The C - terminal tags like GFP , mCherry , 5xFlag and gene deletion cassettes like spc105 Δ : : NAT and kre28 Δ : : NAT were introduced at the endogenous locus through hom - ologous recombination of PCR amplicons [ 38 ] . A 7 - amino acid linker ( sequence : ‘ RIPGLIN ’ ) bridges the tags ( GFP , mCherry , or 5xFlag ) from the C - termini of the tagged proteins . Earlier , we observed that the intensity of mCherry - tagged KT proteins varies significantly from one transformant to another for the same strain , due to inherent variability of the mCherry brightness . Therefore , to con - struct all the FRET strains with Ndc80 , Stu2 , Nsl1 , Kre28 and Ask1 - mCherry , we crossed a specific mCherry strain with haploid strains of all GFP - fused Spc105 alleles and sporulated the heterozygous diploids to obtain the desired segregants . To construct the yeast strains with internally tagged Spc105 mentioned in electronic supplementary material , figure S1 , and the strains with truncated Spc105 mentioned in figure 3 , first we used Bst EII digest of pRS305 chimera or Stu I digest of pRS306 chimera of Spc105 - GFP fusion alleles to transform AJY3278 ( SPC105 / Δ : : NAT ) that was later sporu - lated to obtain the haploid segregants expressing only GFP fusion copy of Spc105 . To construct some these strains , first we deleted the genomic copy of SPC105 in a strain already supplemented with the wild - type SPC105 gene expressed from centromeric plasmid yCP50 ( URA3 ) . Then , the pRS315 chimera containing Spc105 - GFP alleles were transformed in that strain . After that , the strains expressing only Spc105 - GFP alleles were generated by negative selection for yCP50 on 5 - FOA plates . The construction of chimeras for over - expression of Kre28 FL or truncations was achieved by cloning N - terminal GFP tagged fusions of Kre28 in a centromeric plasmid pRS414 , where KRE28 ORF is flanked by ADH1 ( alcohol dehydrogenase 1 ) promoter and GFP ORF at the upstream and CYC ( Cytochrome C ) terminator at the downstream ( obtained from Dr Mara Duncan ’ s lab , department of Cell and Developmental Biology , University of Michigan ) . Kre28 fragments were cloned in Bam HI - Pst I sites . SV40 - NLS was cloned within Pst I - Sal I . For wild - type expression , Kre28 FL and its truncations were cloned in Bam HI - Pst I of a pRS305 plasmid . They were expressed as N - terminal GFP tagged fusions by its own promoter and terminator . Bst EII digests of these chimeras are transformed in AJY3298 ( kre28 Δ : : NAT / KRE28 - mCherry - Hyg ) to check for their localization . To create diploid zygotes , two strains of a and α mating types are mixed with each other and spotted on YPD plate which was incubated for 3 – 4 h at 30°C . To induce sporula - tion , diploid yeast cells were grown in YPD overnight to stationary phase . Next day cells were pelleted down and resuspended with starvation media ( 0 . 1 % yeast extract , 1 % potassium acetate , 0 . 025 % dextrose ) and incubated 4 – 5 days at RT . 4 . 2 . Yeast two - hybrid assay We performed yeast two - hybrid experiments by co - trans - forming both of prey ( pGAD _ C1 ) and bait ( pGBD _ C1 ) chimera in strain AJY3802 ( PJ69A ) [ 39 ] . Then , we streaked two of the transformants for each prey - bait pair on synthetic dextrose plates of histidine dropout ( - HIS ) and dropout of histidine and adenine ( - HIS - ADE ) . Plates were incubated in 32°C for at least 3 days . 4 . 3 . Benomyl - sensitivity assay This experiment was performed as described previously [ 6 , 26 ] . Starting from 0 . 1 OD 600 of log - phase cultures , we pre - pared 10 - fold serial dilutions and frogged or spotted them on YPD and YPD containing 20 µg ml − 1 and 30 µg ml − 1 beno - myl . At least two biological replicates were used , and spotting was repeated twice for each set of experiments . The plates were incubated at 32°C and pictures were taken r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o b O p e n B i o l . 12 : 210274 11 Table 2 .

For space limit - ations , we showed only YPD + Ben 30 plates . For all spotting assays with benomyl , we used YEF473 or strain expressing Spc105 222 : : GFP as wide - type ( positive control ) and mad2 Δ or sgo1 Δ as negative controls . Before spotting , we grew the strains expressing truncated kre28 or Kre28 FL control in synthetic dextrose media ( Sd - Trp ) without Tryptophan to culture only cells carrying the pRS414 chimera . As shown in the plate images , we also used strains expressing Kre28 FL - mCherry along with truncated kre28 as controls which did not show any discernable difference in growth , compared to wild - type . 4 . 4 . Microscopy and image acquisition and analyses A Nikon Ti - E inverted microscope with a 1 . 4 NA , 100X , oil - immersion objective was used for experiments mentioned in the paper [ 40 ] . A ten - plane Z - stack was acquired ( 200 nm separation between adjacent planes ) . To measure Ndc80 and Spc105 - mCherry , an extra 1 . 5 x opto - var lens was used . We measured total fluorescence of KT clusters ( 16 KTs in metaphase ) by integrating the intensities over a 6 × 6 region centred on the maximum intensity pixel . We used median intensity of pixels immedi - ately surrounding the 6 × 6 area to correct for background Table 2 .

The calculation was performed using semi - automated MATLAB programs as described earlier [ 41 ] . FRET , high - resolution colocalization , fluorescence distribution analyses and analyses of the images were performed as previously described [ 7 , 8 , 27 , 40 , 42 ] . While measuring proximity ratio , we considered any value below 0 . 10 as no FRET ( mean of the data marked as black ) , range between 0 . 10 and 0 . 3 as medium to low FRET ( average of the data marked as red ) and any values above 0 . 3 as high FRET ( mean of the data marked as red ) . 4 . 5 . Titration of Kre28 and Spc105 proteins levels and quantification of Kre28 , Spc105 and Ndc80 intensities We grew the strains with prGALL - SPC105 or prGALL - KRE28 in the presence of raffinose ( 2 % ) . On the day of the assay , we supplemented the media with variable amounts of galactose as discussed previously ( 2 % , 1 . 5 % , 0 . 5 % , 0 . 2 % , 0 . 1 % and 0 . 05 % ) [ 27 ] . We determined the number of Kre28 , Spc105 and Ndc80 from their intensities as reported previously Table 3 .

We first deduced the fluorescence intensities of Kre28 - mCherry , Ndc80 - GFP and Spc105 - GFP from bioriented KTs . We used AJY939 ( Ndc80 - GFP , Spc25 - mCherry ) as a reference to obtain the intensities for known number of Ndc80 and Spc25 molecules at the bioriented KTs . AJY939 was cultured under same imaging conditions as the experimental strains , and the calibration data were acquired throughout the dur - ation of this study . This calibration accounted for alteration in the microscope and imaging technique set - up over time . We used the values of Ndc80 - GFP and Spc25 - mcherry to determine the number of molecules of Spc105 - GFP and Kre28 - mCherry that were loaded in the bioriented KTs . 4 . 6 . Preparation of cell lysates and western blot assay To prepare cell lysates , log - phase cells ( OD 600 2 . 0 ) were pelleted , resuspended in sample buffer ( 2 % SDS , 1 % 2 - mer - captoethanol ) , boiled and lysed by glass - bead mechanical disruption [ 7 ] . The lysates were collected after centrifugation . After separating the proteins by 10 % SDS – PAGE , samples were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF blocked with 5 % skimmed milk in TBS - T ( 137 mM NaCl , 15 . 2 mM Tris - HCl , 4 . 54 mM Tris , 0 . 896 mM Tween 20 ) and then probed with pri - mary and fluorescent secondary antibodies . Mouse α - GFP antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( 1 : 2000 , GFP ( B - 2 ) : sc - 9996 ) . Peroxidase conjugated α - mouse IgG ( 1 : 5000 ; Sigma , A - 4416 ) treated with ECL ( Thermo Scientific ) was used to develop the western blot . 4 . 7 . GFP - trap and RFP - trap assay to pull down Spc105 and immunoblot assay We used AJY6273 and AJY6274 for GFP - trap experiments . As mentioned in the strain list , AJY6273 expresses Spc105 455 : : GFP from a centromeric plasmid ( pRS315 ) and genomic SPC105 allele is deleted . The truncation of 313 – 638 affects the cell via - bility ; hence in AJY6374 , the genomic SPC105 allele was intact and spc105 Δ 313 – 638 was expressed from a centromeric plasmid ( pRS315 ) . We grew both the strains in synthetic dextrose media devoid of leucine ( SD - LEU ) to maintain the centromeric plasmid before harvesting them for cell lysis . For RFP - trap assays , we used AJY3483 and AJY3484 ( see strain list for detailed information on their genotypes ) . We grew the strains in SD - TRP ( synthetic dextrose devoid of tryptophan ) media till late log - phase before harvesting the cells . We lysed the cells by glass - beads in the presence of buffer H 0 . 15 ( 25 mM HEPES of pH 8 . 0 , 2 . 0 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA of pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA - KOH of pH 8 . 0 , 15 % glycerol , 0 . 1 % IGEPAL - CA - 630 and 150 mM KCl ) , supplemented with 0 . 2 mM PMSF , protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails [ 43 ] . We isolated clear lysates of the strains and from there , we incu - bated equal amount of lysates with pre - equilibrated beads of GFP - trap ( Chromotek , gta - 20 ) or RFP - Trap ( Chromotek , rta - 20 ) overnight . Next day , we washed the beads with post IP wash buffer ( composition as mentioned above ) with and with - out 2 mM Dithiothreitol , before boiling them in the presence of 1xSDS loading buffer . After subjecting the proteins through SDS – PAGE , we transferred them to nitrocellulose membrane which we blocked with 5 % skimmed milk in 1x phosphate - buffered saline - Tween ( PBS - T , 137 mM NaCl , 10 mM phosphate , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) . We probed the blot with Mouse anti - GFP ( JL8 , Living Colors , Takara , 1 : 3000 ) or Mouse anti - Ds - Red ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 390909 , 1 : 2000 ) , Mouse α - Flag M2 ( Sigma - Aldrich , 1 : 5000 ) and HRP conjugated secondary anti - Mouse ( Sigma - Aldrich , 1 : 10 000 ) . ECL ( Thermo Scientific ) treatment was used to develop the western blot . We exposed the anti - Ds - Red blots to X - ray films . Anti - GFP and anti - Flag blots were imaged by C600 imager ( Azure Biosystems ) . We calculated the band intensities by ImageJ in RFP - TRAP assay . Then , we normalized both Spc105 and Kre28 intensities of the truncation mutants with those of the full - length proteins . After that , we normalized Kre28 IP inten - sities with that of normalized Kre28 input values . Following that , we divided the Kre28 IP intensities with Spc105 IP inten - sities . We mentioned those values as fold difference at the bottom of the immunoblot panels ( figure 4 d ) . 4 . 8 . Flow cytometry We performed flow cytometry as described previously [ 6 , 26 ] . For strains expressing Kre28 _ FL or truncated kre28 , we started with overnight inoculums grown in Sd - Trp and shifted to YPD to grow till early to mid - log phase before supplementing the media with Nocodazole ( final concentration 15 µg ml − 1 ) or DMSO control . We collected cell samples at 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 h post - drug treatment and fixed them with 70 % ethanol before stor - ing them at 4°C overnight . Next day , after removing the Ethanol , treated the samples with bovine pancreatic RNase ( Millipore Sigma , final concentration 170 ng ml − 1 ) at 37°C for 6 h - overnight in RNase buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 15 mM NaCl ) . After that , we removed the RNase and resuspended the cells in 1x PBS . We treated the samples with propidium iodide ( Millipore Sigma , final concentration 5 mg ml − 1 in PBS ) for at least 1 h at room temperature before analysing them using the LSR Fortessa machine ( BD Biosciences ) in Bio - medical research core facility , University of Michigan medical school . We analysed and organized the data using FlowJo software ( FlowJo _ V10 . 7 . 1 _ CL ) . 4 . 9 . Nuclear localization signal mapping We performed NLS mapping by pasting the amino acid sequences of Spc105 and Kre28 in the website of http : / / nls - mapper . iab . keio . ac . jp / cgi - bin / NLS _ Mapper _ form . cgi and keeping the cut - off score to 5 . 0 [ 44 , 45 ] . It scored SV40 - NLS ( TPPKKKRKVA , monopartite ) as 15 . 5 . We observed score of 9 . 0 ( monopartite ) for Spc105 337 – 345 ( SSNKRRKLD ) and 6 . 9 ( bipartite ) for Spc105 599 – 625 ( NTLKREYEKLNEEVEKVN - SIRGKIRKL ) . We did not find any NLS for Kre28 without setting the cut - off score to 4 . 0 . Kre28 207 – 234 and Kre28 286 – 317 displayed NLS scores of 4 . 2 and 4 . 0 ( bipartite ) , respectively . 4 . 10 . Prediction of coiled - coil domains in Kre28 and spc105 451 – 917 We predicted the CC of full - length Kre28 and spc105 451 – 917 by inserting their amino acid sequences on the website of https : / / embnet . vital - it . ch / software / COILS _ form . html [ 46 ] . We used MTIDK matrix for the prediction . We downloaded the output in postscript format and further configured by adobe illustrator . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o b O p e n B i o l . 12 : 210274 15 4 . 11 . Prediction of spc105 451 – 917 - Kre28 interaction interface by Colabfold We used Colabfold to predict the complex formed by inter - action of Kre28 FL and spc105 451 – 917 ( https : / / colab . research . google . com / github / sokrypton / ColabFold / blob / main / beta / AlphaFold2 _ advanced . ipynb , [ 31 ] ) . The following parameters were used for the structure prediction : msa _ method : mmseqs _ 2 , pair _ mode : unpaired , pair _ cov = 50 , pair _ qid = 20 , rank _ by = pTMscore , num _ models = 5 , use _ ptm = True , max _ recycles = 3 , tol = 0 , num _ samples = 1 , subsample _ msa = True , num _ relax = None . We processed the figures of the predicted structure by PyMOL 2 . 5 ( https : / / pymol . org / 2 / , Schrödinger , LLC ) . The pLDDT confidence matrix was depicted byspectrum b mapping in PyMOL . Pair Alignment Error matrix was prepared by Colabfold . 4 . 12 . Statistical analysis We analysed the data and assembled the graphs by Graph - Pad Prism 8 software . We performed unpaired t - test ( Mann – Whitney test ) and one - way ANOVA analyses to check the statistical significances of the data . The p - values are mentioned on the top of the graph .
