Karpushev , Vladislav Levchenko , Daria V . Ilatovskaya , Tengis S . Pavlov , Alexander Staruschenko Abstract —The epithelial Na (cid:1) channel ( ENaC ) is an essential channel responsible for Na (cid:1) reabsorption in the aldosterone - sensitive distal nephron . Consequently , ENaC is a major effector impacting systemic blood volume and pressure . We have shown recently that Rac1 increases ENaC activity , whereas Cdc42 fails to change channel activity . Here we tested whether Rac1 signaling plays a physiological role in modulating ENaC in native tissue and polarized epithelial cells . We found that Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 markedly decreased ENaC activity in freshly isolated collecting ducts . Knockdown of Rac1 in native principal cells decreased ENaC - mediated sodium reabsorption and the number of channels at the apical plasma membrane . Members of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family play a central role in the control of the actin cytoskeleton . N - WASP functions downstream of Cdc42 , whereas WAVEs are effectors of Rac1 activity . N - WASP and all 3 isoforms of WAVE significantly increased ENaC activity when coexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells . However , wiskostatin , an inhibitor of N - WASP , had no effect on ENaC activity . Immunoblotting demonstrated the presence of WAVE1 and WAVE2 and absence of N - WASP and WAVE3 in mpkCCD c14 and M - 1 principal cells . Immunohistochemistry analysis also revealed localization of WAVE1 and WAVE2 but not N - WASP in the cortical collecting duct of Sprague - Dawley rat kidneys . Moreover , patch clamp analysis revealed that Rac1 and WAVE1 / 2 are parts of the same signaling pathway with respect to activation of ENaC . Thus , our findings suggest that Rac1 is essential for ENaC activity and regulates the channel via WAVE proteins .

ENaC dysfunction leads to disturbances in total body Na (cid:1) homeostasis associated with abnormal regulation of blood volume , blood pressure , and lung fluid balance . 1 – 3 For example , partial loss of function in ENaC produces pseudohypoaldoste - ronism type 1 , characterized by salt wasting . In contrast , a gain - of - function mutation leads to Liddle syndrome . 4 Ion channels are recognized to be important physiological effectors of small G proteins . 5 Small G proteins are molecular switches that control the activity of cellular and membrane proteins and regulate a wide variety of cell functions , includ - ing cytoskeleton reorganization . Dysfunction in small G proteins of the Rho family , including Rac1 , Cdc42 , and RhoA , contributes to the pathology of renal and cardiovas - cular diseases , such as hypertension and proteinuric kidney disease . 6 , 7 A cellular mechanism for this process is obscure . Rac1 plays a role in some renal and cardiovascular diseases , possibly influencing systemic Na (cid:1) and water balance . Shi - bata et al 8 have established recently that signaling cross - talk between Rac1 and the mineralocorticoid receptor modulates receptor activity and identified Rac1 as a therapeutic target for chronic kidney disease . Silva and Garvin 9 and Takemura et al 10 also recently identified an important role for Rac1 in NaCl - induced superoxide generation in the medullary thick ascending limb 9 and in the alveolar epithelium . 10 Members of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) / WAVE family ( N - WASP , WASP , and WAVE1 , - 2 , - 3 isoforms ) share similar domain structure and activate Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization , leading to distinct downstream effects . N - WASP inducibly binds Arp2 / 3 in response to Cdc42 , whereas WAVE proteins constitutively interact with Arp2 / 3 and are effectors of Rac1 activity . 11 We have shown recently that wild - type and constitutively active ( QL ) Rac1 significantly increase ENaC activity . However , neither coexpression with wild - type nor with constitutively active Cdc42 G12V had an effect on ENaC activity . 12 In the present study we report that Rac1 is required for ENaC activity in native principal cells .

Thus , these results reveal a new signaling pathway medi - ating the regulation of ENaC . Materials and Methods cDNA Constructs and Cell Culture All of the chemicals and materials were purchased from Fisher Scientific , Sigma , or CalBiochem unless noted otherwise . NSC23766 was obtained from Tocris Biosciences . Wiskostatin was from Enzo Life Sciences ( Plymouth Meeting , PA ) . Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) and M - 1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained with standard culture conditions ( DMEM , 5 % FBS , 1 (cid:2) penicillin - streptomycin , 37°C , 5 % CO 2 ) . MpkCCD c14 cells were kindly provided by Dr A . Vandewalle ( Institut National de la Sante´ et de la Recherche Me´dicale , Paris , France ) and described previously . 13 , 14 For electrophysiological ex - periments , principal cells were grown on permeable supports ( Costar Transwells ; 0 . 4 - (cid:1) m pore , 24 - mm diameter ) and maintained with FBS and corticosteroids allowing them to polarize and form mono - layers with high resistance and avid Na (cid:1) reabsorption . The mam - malian expression vectors encoding mouse (cid:2) - , (cid:3) - , and (cid:4) - ENaC have been described previously . 15 , 16 The expression vectors encoding Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome - like ( SC111092 ) , WAS protein fam - ily , member 1 ( WASF1 ) ( SC117699 ) , WASF2 ( SC126670 ) , and WASF3 ( SC115933 ) were from OriGene ( Rockville , MD ) .

DerMard - irossian on behalf of G . M . Bokoch ( Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , CA ) . Isolation of Collecting Ducts Patch clamp electrophysiology was used to assess ENaC activity in isolated , split - open rat cortical collecting duct ( CCD ) . CCDs were isolated from salt - restricted ( Na (cid:1) - deficient diet for 1 week ) Sprague - Dawley rats as described previously . 12 , 14 , 17 Kidneys were cut into thin sections ( (cid:3) 1 mm ) with sections placed into ice - cold physiolog - ical saline solution ( pH 7 . 4 ) . CCDs were mechanically isolated from these sections by microdissection using forceps under a stereomicro - scope . CCDs were split opened with a sharpened micropipette controlled with a micromanipulator to gain access to the apical membrane . Animal use and welfare procedures adhered to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals following a protocol reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Transfection and Rac1 Knockdown For electrophysiological experiments , CHO cells were seeded on sterile 4 (cid:2) 4 - mm cover glass and transfected using Polyfect reagent ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) , as described previously . 12 , 16 Mouse ENaC ( mENaC ) was reconstituted by coexpressing (cid:2) - , (cid:3) - , and (cid:4) - channel subunits together ( 0 . 1 to 0 . 3 (cid:1) g of each cDNA per 35 - mm dish ) . Rac1 short hairpin ( sh ) RNA lentiviral particles ( sc - 36352 - V ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) were used for the inhibition of Rac1 expression in principal cells . Control shRNA lentiviral particles ( sc - 108080 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) were used to confirm the selectivity of lentiviruses . After transduction with Santa Cruz trans - fection reagent ( sc - 108061 ) , stable cell line expressing the shRNA was isolated via selection with puromycin . Electrophysiology Single - channel and whole - cell current data were acquired and subsequently analyzed with an Axopatch 200B amplifier ( Axon Instruments ) interfaced via a Digidata 1440A to a PC running the pClamp 10 . 2 suite of software ( Axon Instruments ) . For single channel recordings , currents were filtered with an 8 - pole , low - pass Bessel filter LPF - 8 ( Warner Institute , Hamden , CT ) at 0 . 2 kHz . Typical bath solution was ( in millimoles ) : 150 NaCl , 1 CaCl 2 , 2 MgCl 2 , and 10 HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Pipette solutions for cell attached and whole cell configurations were ( in millimoles ) : 140 . 0 LiCl , 2 . 0 MgCl 2 , and 10 . 0 mmol / L of HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) and 120 . 0 CsCl , 5 . 0 NaCl , 2 . 0 MgCl 2 , 5 . 0 EGTA , 2 . 0 Mg - ATP , 0 . 1 GTP , and 10 mmol / L of HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , respectively . Single - channel analysis was performed as described previously . 12 Whole - cell macroscopic cur - rent recordings of mENaC expressed in CHO cells were made under voltage - clamp conditions using standard methods . 12 , 16 Immunohistochemistry and Western Blot Analysis The Sprague - Dawley rat kidneys were fixed in Zinc formalin and processed for paraffin embedding . The kidney sections were cut , dried , and deparaffinized for subsequent labeled streptavidin - biotin immunohistochemistry . After deparaffinization , the slides were treated with a citrate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 ) for a total of 35 minutes . The slides were blocked with a peroxidase block ( DAKO ) , Avidin Block ( Vector Laboratories ) , Biotin Block ( Vector Laboratories ) , and serum - free protein block ( DAKO ) . Tissue sections were incubated for 90 minutes in 1 : 200 , 1 : 400 , or 1 : 500 concentrations of N - WASP ( AB1963 ) , WAVE1 ( # 07 - 037 ) , or WAVE2 ( 4226 ; Millipore , Te - mecula , CA ) , respectively . Secondary detection was performed with goat anti - rabbit biotinylated IgG ( Biocare ) followed by streptavidin horseradish peroxidase ( Biocare ) and visualized with diaminobenzi - dine ( DAKO ) . All of the slides were counterstained with Mayers hematoxylin ( DAKO ) , dehydrated , and mounted with permanent mounting media ( SAKURA ) . Expression of proteins was analyzed in mpkCCD c14 and M - 1 cells by immunoblotting with antibodies to the N - WASP , WAVE / Scar , WAVE - 2 , and WAVE - 3 ( # 09 - 145 ; all Millipore ) . Control cell lysate for WAVE1 derived from 3T3 / A31 cell line was also obtained from Millipore ( # 12 - 305 ) . Equal amounts of cell lysate were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against corresponding pro - teins and (cid:3) - actin , as was described previously . 12 , 18 3 - ( 4 , 5 - Dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide Cell Viability Assay For the 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bro - mide ( MTT ) assay , mpkCCD c14 cells were seeded as was done previously 19 into 12 - well cluster plates at a subconfluent levels and allowed to grow for (cid:5) 1 week . After treatment , MTT ( Sigma - Al - drich ) was added ( 0 . 5 mg / mL ) and cells were incubated for 30 minutes . The medium was aspirated and replaced with isopropanol to solubilize the formazan products followed by optical density read - ings at 570 nm . The cell viability as a percentage of the untreated cells was calculated from the absorbance values . Statistics All of the summarized data are reported as mean (cid:4) SEM . Data are compared using either the Student ( 2 - tailed ) t test or a one - way ANOVA ( post hoc comparison with Bonferroni multiple correction ) , and P (cid:3) 0 . 05 is considered significant . Results Rac1 Is Essential for ENaC Activity and ENaC - Mediated Sodium Reabsorption We and others have shown previously that several small G proteins including Rac1 regulate ENaC activity through different mechanisms . 5 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 16 , 20 – 22 Rac1 markedly en - hanced ENaC activity when coexpressed in CHO cells . 12 , 15 Surprisingly , coexpression of neither wild - type nor constitu - tively active ( G12V ) mutant Cdc42 had any effect on ENaC activity . 12 Herein , we tested the hypothesis that Rac1 is also essential for physiological regulation of the channel in native and cultured principal cells . As shown in Figure 1A , the addition of NSC23766 ( 100 (cid:1) mol / L ) , a selective inhibitor of the Rac1 - GEF interaction , 23 significantly decreased ENaC Karpushev et al Rac1 / WAVE Modulates ENaC Activity 997 at Tufts University - - Boston on March 3 , 2013 http : / / hyper . ahajournals . org / Downloaded from activity in freshly isolated rat CCD . ENaC activity was recorded for (cid:5) 3 minutes before application of NSC23766 , and we used patches with stable ENaC open probability only . Application of vehicle had no effect on ENaC activity ( data not shown ) . A continuous trace is shown at the top . Segments before and after NSC23766 are shown below at expanded time scales . As is apparent from this representative trace and summarized in Figure 1B , inhibition of Rac1 - GEF interaction resulted in a rapid decrease of ENaC activity in this native preparation . To test for possible cytotoxic effect of NSC23766 , we performed MTT cell viability assay . This assay measures the conversion of MTT of living cells , and a decrease in cellular MTT formazan could be the index of grow inhibition and cell toxicity . Data obtained revealed that 100 (cid:1) mol / L of NSC23766 had no effect on cell vitality of the mpkCCD c14 cells ( Figure 1C ) . To further establish the role of Rac1 in ENaC - mediated sodium reabsorption in principal cells , we used shRNA against Rac1 . Antimouse Rac1 shRNA lentiviral particles were used to downregulate mRNA levels of Rac1 in the M - 1 cells . These cells retain many characteristics of native CCD cells , including morphology and antigens , and are routinely used to study ENaC activity and sodium reabsorption . 24 – 26 Efficient downregulation of Rac1 expression in M - 1 cells stably expressing anti - Rac1 shRNA lentivirus was verified by Western blot analysis ( Figure 2A and 2B ) . Functional conse - quences of Rac1 silencing were examined with transepithelial electric measurements and patch clamp analysis . Rac1 knock - down significantly decreased basal transepithelial Na (cid:1) flux in the M - 1 cells ( Figure 2C ) . Control ( scrambled shRNA ) and Rac1 knockdown M - 1 cells were seeded simultaneously at the same concentration and grown in the same conditions . Amiloride ( 10 (cid:1) mol / L ) was added to the apical membrane at the end of experiments to confirm that short - circuit current was mediated by ENaC . Furthermore , as demonstrated by patch clamp analysis , Rac1 knockdown decreased ENaC activity in the M - 1 cells ( Figure 2D ) . For these experiments , cell - attached seals were formed on the apical membrane of control M - 1 cells and cells with knockdown of Rac1 . Single - channel analysis revealed that Rac1 knockdown results in a decrease of the number of active channels ( N ) and has no effect on the channel open probability ( Figure 2E and 2F ) . N - WASP and WAVE Proteins Increase ENaC Activity To investigate the actions of the N - WASP and WAVE proteins on ENaC , we reconstituted mouse ENaC in CHO cells in the absence and presence of coexpressed N - WASP , WAVE1 , WAVE2 , and WAVE3 . Figure 3A shows typical currents before ( arrows ) and after treatment with amiloride ( 10 (cid:1) mol / L ) from voltage clamp experiments performed on CHO cells containing ENaC alone or coexpressed with WAVE1 . For these experiments , cells were held at a holding potential of 40 mV with voltage ramps ( 300 ms ) from 60 mV down to (cid:5) 100 mV used to elicit current ( Figure 3B ) . Figure 3C shows a summary graph of experiments testing the role of N - WASP and WAVE proteins in regulation of ENaC activity . These results demonstrate that coexpression of N - WASP and WAVEs with ENaC in CHO cells markedly increases chan - nel activity . WAVEs But Not N - WASP Are Expressed in Principal Cells and Localized in Rat CCD and Regulate ENaC - Mediated Sodium Transport Using Western blot analysis , we examined the expression profile of N - WASP / WAVE proteins in the cultured principal cells . We found high expression levels of WAVE1 and WAVE2 in both mpkCCDc14 and M - 1 cells . In contrast , neither WAVE3 nor N - WASP was detected in these cell lines ( Figure 4A ) . Immunohistochemistry analysis also revealed localization of only WAVE1 and WAVE2 in the CCD of Sprague - Dawley rat kidneys . Shown in Figure 4B are images from kidney immunohistochemically stained for N - WASP , WAVE1 , and WAVE2 at (cid:2) 60 magnifications . Negative control ( stained with secondary antibodies in the absence of primary antibodies ) is also shown .

Absorbance at 495 nm was measured , and the percentage of growth against untreated cells was calculated . Data are represented as a viable fraction ( percentage ) of untreated cells from (cid:5) 3 experiments . 998 Hypertension May 2011 at Tufts University - - Boston on March 3 , 2013 http : / / hyper . ahajournals . org / Downloaded from antibodies ) also did not show any staining ( data not shown ) . As clear from the immunohistochemical staining , WAVE1 and WAVE2 are localized in the CCD ( shown by arrows ) . Surprisingly , we did not observe any staining for N - WASP in the CCD ( Figure 4B ) . Thus , these results demonstrate that WAVE but not N - WASP proteins are expressed in cultured principal cell lines and localized in CCD . To confirm this finding , we used wiskostatin , a selective inhibitor of N - WASP . 27 We tested an effect of wiskostatin on ENaC activity when the channel was overexpressed in CHO cells either alone or with N - WASP or WAVE1 .

Rac1 Enhances ENaC Activity via WAVE1 or WAVE2 Results in Figure 3 demonstrate that WAVE proteins enhance ENaC activity when these proteins are coexpressed in CHO cells . Moreover , as we demonstrated previously , Rac1 also increases amiloride - sensitive current density . 12 , 15 To test whether Rac1 and WAVE signaling converge before activat - ing ENaC , we probed the effects of coexpressing these proteins on ENaC activity . As summarized in Figure 5A , ENaC activity in the presence of constitutively active Rac1 ( QL ) and WAVE1 did not change compared with ENaC plus either Rac1 or WAVE1 . Similarly , we did not observe any additive effect when ENaC was coexpressed with Rac1 and WAVE2 ( Figure 5B ) . These results demonstrate that coex - pression of downstream effectors of Rac1 recapitulates inde - pendent activation of ENaC by this small G protein . In addition we tested an effect of dominant - negative Rac1 T17N on the activity of ENaC coexpressed with WAVE1 or WAVE2 ( Figure 5C ) . As seen from this Figure , dominant - negative Rac1 precludes WAVE1 - or WAVE2 - mediated enhancement of ENaC activity . Thus , the results in Figure 5 are consistent with the concept that Rac1 and WAVE1 / 2 are components of the same signaling mechanism with respect to activation of ENaC and that active Rac1 is required for WAVE proteins to increase ENaC activity . Discussion ENaC is regulated by small G proteins and the actin cyto - skeleton . 5 , 12 , 15 , 16 , 20 , 28 – 30 Several other epithelial ion channels in the kidney are also regulated by small GTPase Rac1 through different mechanisms . For instance , Bezzerides et al 31 demonstrated that epidermal growth factor stimulation rapidly induces TRPC5 channel translocation to the plasma membrane , and this insertion is mediated via Rac1 . Thebault et al 32 also reported that epidermal growth factor – mediated stimulation of TRPM6 occurs via signaling through Src kinases and Rac1 , thereby redistributing endomembrane TRPM6 to the plasma membrane . The role of Rho family proteins and their regulators in the pathogenesis of high blood pressure was discussed recently . 33 WASP family proteins are emerging as central regulators of actin assembly via their interactions with small G proteins of the Rho family , partic - ularly Rac1 and Cdc42 . 11 WASP and N - WASP function downstream of Cdc42 .

Interestingly , our recent data revealed that ENaC is specifically regulated by Rac1 but not Cdc42 . 12 Defining the role of WAVE proteins as specific regulators of ENaC greatly clarifies the regulation of ENaC by Rac1 over Cdc42 . We have demonstrated here that N - WASP , WAVE1 , WAVE2 , and WAVE3 upregulate ENaC activity when over - expressed in CHO cells . However , a combination of pharma - cological approach with Western blotting and immunohisto - chemistry provides reliable evidence for the role of WAVE but not N - WASP proteins in regulation of ENaC activity . Western blot analysis revealed strong expression of WAVE1 and WAVE2 only in cultured principal cells . Immunohisto - chemical analysis also identified WAVE1 and WAVE2 but not N - WASP in the CCD of the kidneys of Sprague - Dawley rats . Similarly , Yamazaki et al 34 have shown that WAVE1 and WAVE2 were expressed in Madin - Darby canine kidney cells . The functions of WAVE1 and WAVE2 were redundant in this system , but WAVE2 appeared to play a more signif - icant role . The authors have proposed that Rac - WAVE – mediated actin reorganization is required for organization and maintenance of cell - cell adhesion . Furthermore , we have shown that wiskostatin , a recently described chemical inhib - itor that selectively inhibits N - WASP - mediated actin polym - erization in vitro , 27 , 35 has no effect on ENaC either when expressed alone or when coexpressed with N - WASP or WAVE1 and that this inhibitor does not alter ENaC - mediated sodium reabsorption in mpkCCD c14 cells . Despite a growing number of recent studies , which use wiskostatin to uncover novel cellular functions for N - WASP , the selectivity of this particular drug has not been completely determined yet . In fact , it was shown that wiskostatin treatment causes a rapid irreversible decrease in cellular ATP levels . 36 Thus , Rac1 - WAVE signaling complex might play a central role in blood pressure control in the kidney . The details of this mechanism and , in particular , the downstream signaling have not been fully delineated . For example , it was shown that the intermediary protein linking Rac1 and WAVE2 is IRSp53 , the insulin receptor substrate . 37 , 38 Interestingly , insulin is known to increase ENaC activity . It is possible that it does so in part via IRSp53 impinging on Rac1 / WAVE signaling . Moreover , mitogen - activated protein kinase and NADPH might also be involved in the effect of Rac1 on ENaC . Furthermore , WAVE proteins contain several important bind - ing domains including a WAVE homology domain at the N - terminus , a basic region , a proline - rich region , and a C - terminal verprolin - cofilin - acidic region involved in bind - ing actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex . WAVE2 exists in a multimolecular complex with several other proteins , includ - ing PIR121 or Sra - 1 , Nap1 , Abi - 1 / 2 , and HSPC300 . 39 How - ever , exact mechanisms involved in regulation of this com - plex are not defined yet . Perspectives Long - term control of blood pressure involves Na (cid:1) homeo - stasis through the precise regulation of ENaC . The role of Rac1 proteins in hypertension was also proposed . This study has identified that , in the kidney , ENaC is a regulation target for Rac1 . The regulation of ENaC by Rac1 appears to be mediated via WAVE proteins . A role for Rac1 and WAVEs in the regulation of ENaC activity is a new concept . There - fore , it is important to understand this mechanism of renal blood pressure control and its role in the diseases associated with fluid imbalance and hypertension . Moreover , our data suggest that Rac1 and WAVE proteins are potential targets for the prevention of ENaC - mediated diseases . Future studies are needed to investigate the functional role , as well as the mechanisms , of Rac1 / WAVE / ENaC signaling pathway in the development of such diseases in hypertensive and transgenic models . Furthermore , several important activators of Rac1 signaling , such as epidermal growth factor and angiotensin II , might be involved in this mechanism , and their role should be defined in future studies .
