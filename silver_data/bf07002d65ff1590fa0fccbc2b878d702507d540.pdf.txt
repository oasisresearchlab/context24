Klaenhammer , North Carolina State University , Raleigh , NC , and approved September 8 2008 ( received for review May 22 , 2008 ) A decrease in the abundance and biodiversity of intestinal bacteria within the dominant phylum Firmicutes has been observed repeat - edly in Crohn disease ( CD ) patients . In this study , we determined the composition of the mucosa - associated microbiota of CD patients at the time of surgical resection and 6 months later using FISH analysis . We found that a reduction of a major member of Firmicutes , Faeca - libacterium prausnitzii , is associated with a higher risk of postoper - ative recurrence of ileal CD . A lower proportion of F . prausnitzii on resected ileal Crohn mucosa also was associated with endoscopic recurrence at 6 months . To evaluate the immunomodulatory proper - ties of F . prausnitzii we analyzed the anti - inﬂammatory effects of F . prausnitzii in both in vitro ( cellular models ) and in vivo [ 2 , 4 , 6 - trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid ( TNBS ) - induced ] colitis in mice . In Caco - 2 cells transfected with a reporter gene for NF - (cid:1) B activity , F . prausnitzii hadnoeffectonIL - 1 (cid:2) - inducedNF - (cid:1) Bactivity , whereasthe supernatant abolished it . In vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation by F . prausnitzii led to signiﬁcantly lower IL - 12 and IFN - (cid:3) productionlevelsandhighersecretionofIL - 10 . Oraladministrationof either live F . prausnitzii or its supernatant markedly reduced the severity of TNBS colitis and tended to correct the dysbiosis associated with TNBS colitis , as demonstrated by real - time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) analysis . F . prausnitzii exhibits anti - inﬂammatory effects on cellular and TNBS colitis models , partly due to secreted metabolites able to block NF - (cid:1) B activation and IL - 8 production . These results suggest that counterbalancing dysbiosis using F . prausnitzii as a probiotic is a promising strategy in CD treatment . IBD (cid:2) microbiota (cid:2) probiotic I nflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) is a group of disorders char - acterized by a chronic and relapsing inflammation of the gastro - intestinal tract frequent in Western countries ( 1 ) . The two most common forms of IBD are Crohn disease ( CD ) and ulcerative colitis . The pathogenesis involves an inappropriate and ongoing activation of the mucosal immune system driven by the presence of the intestinal microbiota in a genetically predisposed patient . In CD in particular , the intestinal microbiota is strongly suspected to play a role in initiating and triggering the immune system , leading to characteristic inflammation ( 2 ) . Diversion of the fecal stream prevents postoperative recurrence of ileal CD ( 3 ) . Two antagonistic strategies were proposed to define the role of microorganisms in IBD : ‘‘the candidate microorganism strategy’’ ( 4 ) and the ‘‘global description strategy’’ ( 5 – 7 ) . We previously described the global specificities of the fecal microbiota in CD ( 6 , 8 ) . Using a met - agenomic approach , we revealed a global decrease in the biodiver - sity of the fecal microbiota in CD ( 8 ) . This was essentially due to a markedly reduced diversity of Firmicutes , and in particular of the Clostridium leptum phylogenetic group . Moreover , analysis by FISH combined with flow cytometry showed a significant quantitative reduction in the C . leptum group in CD patients compared with healthy subjects ( 6 , 8 ) . Using different molecular methods , other studies reported that Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was particularly depleted in IBD patients’ ileocolonic mucosa - associated micro - biota ( MAM ) ( 9 , 10 ) . In this study , we first analyzed the composition of the ileal MAM ofCDpatientsatthetimeofsurgicalresectionforactivediseaseand6monthslaterbyFISH . We observed that the proportion of Firmicutes , and in particular of F . prausnitzii , which is the major bacterium of the C . leptum group , was low in patients that exhibited endoscopic recurrence 6 months after surgery . We hypothesized that counterbalancing dysbiosis using this deficient commensal bacterium as a probiotic in CD could be beneficial . Then , we evaluated the potential role of F . prausnitzii on intestinal inflam - mation using cellular and animal models . Results A Lower Proportion of F . prausnitzii on Resected Ileal Crohn Mucosa Is Associated with Endoscopic Recurrence . Previously , we demon - strated that administration of Lactobacillus johnsonii LA1 is inef - fective for prophylaxis of postoperative endoscopic recurrence in CD ( 11 ) . We did not observe any significant difference in the composition of the MAM between L . johnsonii LA1 and placebo groups at the time of surgery or 6 months after in surgical and biopsy samples from 21 human volunteers ( data not shown ) . Focusing on endoscopic recurrence at 6 months ( Rutgeerts score (cid:1) 2 for 13 patients , LA1 n (cid:1) 6 and placebo n (cid:1) 7 ) , we observed : ( i ) a significantly lower proportion of F . prausnitzii at the time of surgery , consistently associated with endoscopic relapse , and ( ii ) a lower proportion of Firmicutes ( i . e . , C . coccoides and F . prausnitzii ) 6 months after surgery in CD patients with endoscopic recurrence when compared with CD patients who were still in remission [ Fig . 1 , supporting information ( SI ) Table S1 , and SI Materials and Authorcontributions : H .

Based on these observations , we hypothesized that remission might be associated with the presence of F . prausnitzii , and probably with its anti - inflammatory effects . F . prausnitzii Exerts Anti - inflammatory Effects in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells ( PBMCs ) . Because the cytokine profile released by PBMCs has been previously shown to correlate the in vitro and in vivo immunomodulation potential of different bacteria ( 29 ) , we analyzed the capacities of F . prausnitzii to induce cytokine produc - tion in PBMCs ( SI Materials and Methods ) . In addition , the immu - nostimulation by four other strains having well - documented in vitro and in vivo anti - inflammatory properties ( Lactobacillus salivarius Ls33 ) ( 12 ) , or lacking any anti - inflammatory activities ( L . acidophi - lus NCFM , Lactococcus lactis MG1363 , and Escherichia coli TG1 ) were also tested ( Fig . 2 ) . Interestingly , F . prausnitzii and L . salivarius Ls33 were the weakest inducers of proinflammatory / Th1 cytokines ( e . g . , IL - 12 and IFN - (cid:2) ) and the highest inducers of anti - inflammatory IL - 10 compared with the other tested strains . The ratio of IL - 10 to IL - 12 , frequently used to distinguish between strains exhibiting a proinflammatory ( low ratio ) vs . an anti - inflammatory ( high ratio ) profile , reveals that F . prausnitzii exhibit the highest anti - inflammatory profile ( Fig . 2 D ) . F . prausnitziiSupernatant Reduces IL - 8 Secretion by Caco - 2 Cells . We examined the effects of UV - killed F . prausnitzii , bacterial fractions , supernatants , or sterile medium on IL - 8 secretion in Caco - 2 cells , with or without IL - 1 (cid:3) stimulation ( SI Materials and Methods and Fig . 3 A ) . Either UV - killed F . prausnitzii , membrane extracts , or cytoplasmic extracts , but not DNA or sterile medium , induce low levels of IL - 8 secretion . UV - killed F . prausnitzii , bacterial fractions , and sterile medium did not inhibit IL - 8 secretion induced by IL - 1 (cid:3) , compared with negative control . In contrast , supernatant from F . prausnitzii cultures significantly reduces IL - 8 secretion induced by IL - 1 (cid:3) . F . prausnitzii Supernatant Abolishes NF - (cid:1) B Activation in Caco - 2 Re - porter Cell Lines . To further explore the immunomodulatory prop - erties of F . prausnitzii , we tested the effects of this bacterium and its supernatant on NF - (cid:4) B activation using a Caco - 2 reporter cell line ( SI Materials and Methods ) . In Caco - 2 cells , F . prausnitzii stimulates an NF - (cid:4) B - dependent secreted alkaline - phosphatase ( SEAP ) pro - duction ( Fig . 3 B ) , whereas the supernatant decreases the basal NF - (cid:4) B activity . After stimulation with IL - 1 (cid:3) , NF - (cid:4) B activity in - creases significantly . No significant effect on IL - 1 (cid:3) stimulation was observed with UV - killed bacteria , whereas the F . prausnitzii super - natant strongly inhibits NF - (cid:4) B activation by IL - 1 (cid:3) in Caco - 2 cells . Because F . prausnitzii produces high amounts of butyrate , which has well known anti - inflammatory effects ( 13 ) , we evaluated the effect of butyrate in Caco - 2 reporter cell lines at the concentration present in the F . prausnitzii supernatant ( i . e . , 40 mM ) . Butyrate did not reproduce the supernatant inhibitory effect after IL - 1 (cid:3) stim - ulation , but in contrast strongly increased NF - (cid:4) B activation ( data not shown ) .

F . prausnitziiSupernatant Did Not DisplayInVitroAntibacterial Effect . We investigated antibacterial properties of F . prausnitzii superna - tant . Using two different in vitro techniques ( critical dilutions of Mayr - Harting et al . , ref . 14 ; and bacteriocin activity assay , ref . 15 ) , we did not reveal any antibacterial effect on several anaerobic and aerobic bacterial species ( see description in Materials and Methods ) . Severity of TNBS - Induced Colitis in Mice Is Reduced by F . prausnitzii and Its Supernatant . We further explored the relevance of these observations in vivo by testing the ability of F . prausnitzii , its DNA andmembranefractions , anditssupernatanttopreventacutecolitis induced by TNBS in BALB / c mice ( SI Materials and Methods and Fig . 4 ) . A severe colitis was observed in the colitis control group . No improvement in colitis severity was observed with either UV - killed F . prausnitzii , its DNA , or its membrane ( data not shown ) .

F . prausnitzii and Its Supernatant Induce an Increased Secretion of IL - 10 and a Decreased Secretion of TNF - (cid:4) and IL - 12 in TNBS - Induced Colitis in Mice . Forty - eight hours after TNBS instillation , colonic proinflammatory TNF - (cid:5) and IL - 12 cytokines and anti - inflammatory IL - 10 were quantified by ELISA ( SI Materials and Methods and Fig . 5 ) . Compared with the no - colitis control group , TNF - (cid:5) and IL - 12 levels were increased , whereas IL - 10 levels were barely modified . In the two TNBS groups treated with either F . prausnitzii or its supernatant , the secretion of TNF - (cid:5) and IL - 12 was significantly lower than in the colitis control group . Interestingly , IL - 10 secretion was induced in the colon of mice treated with F . prausnitzii or its supernatant . F . prausnitzii and Its Supernatant Tend to Counterbalance the TNBS - Induced Dysbiosis in Colitic Mice . To validate our initial hypothesis , we determined the composition of the fecal microbiota of mice from the colitis ( TNBS - treated ) and no - colitis control , the F . prausnitzii - treated , and the supernatant - treated groups by real - time qPCR ( SI Materials and Methods , Table S2 , and Fig . 6 ) .

No difference was observed concerning the Lactobacillus group and E . coli species . F . prausnitzii was the only species diminished in colitis control mice . Treatment with either F . prausnitzii or its supernatant tended to counterbalance the dysbiosis observed in colitis control mice for all bacteria : C . leptum , C . coccoides , Bacteroides , and F . prausnitzii ( Fig . 6 ) . Strikingly , F . prausnitzii occurrence was nearly normalized in the F . prausnitzii - treated group . F . prausnitziiandItsSupernatantCanActbyaGut - IndependentRoute . To investigate whether F . prausnitzii or its supernatant could be active by a gut - independent pathway , we tested i . p . injection in a TNBS - induced colitis model . The survival rates 20 days after colitis induction were 100 % and 10 % in the no - colitis and colitis control groups , respectively ( Fig . 7 ) . In a third control group treated with dexamethasone , the survival rate was 40 % at 20 days . In the groups treated with live F . prausnitzii or the supernatant , the mortality rate was dramatically decreased . The group treated by live F . prausnitzii had a significantly better survival curve than the colitis control group ( P (cid:1) 0 . 039 ) , with a survival rate of 50 % at 20 days , close to the rate observed in the dexamethasone group . The mortality rate in the group treated with the culture supernatant was reduced to 0 ( versus positive control , P (cid:3) 10 (cid:5) 4 ; vs . dexamethasone group , P (cid:1) 0 . 004 ) . Interestingly , this strong anti - inflammatory effect was not due to butyrate presence , as the group of mice treated with butyrate ( at the same concentration as supernatant ) had a mortality rate similar to that in the colitis control group .

Moreover , this bacterium , deficient in CD patients’ microbiota , has anti - inflammatory effects in vitro as well as in vivo . On Caco - 2 cells , secreted metabolites blocked NF - (cid:4) B activation and IL - 8 secretion . Moreover , on PBMCs , F . prausnitzii induced very low levels of IL - 12 and IFN - (cid:2) , whereas high levels of IL - 10 were obtained compared with other bacterial strains tested . Considering the IL10 / IL12 ratio measured on PBMCs , F . prausnitzii displays the most anti - inflammatory properties . These in vitro effects were confirmed in vivo on TNBS - induced colitis . It is now well established that microbial components of the resident microbiota can regulate gut inflammation ( 16 ) . Moreover , some bacterial strains , like Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron , have been particularly studied and their participation in the gut immune homeostasis elucidated ( 17 ) . In parallel , the specificities of the gut microbiota composition in IBD patients have been assessed using molecular methods . Nevertheless , this recent knowledge has not yet beenusedtofindnewanti - inflammatorybacteriawithinthenormal gut microbiota , to date . An original and rational process led us to select F . prausnitzii as a candidate anti - inflammatory bacterium . Comparing any gut microbiota of healthy subjects and of CD patients , we observed that the C . leptum group within the dominant Firmicutes phylum was defective in CD patients’ microbiota ( 6 , 8 ) . This deficiency was quantitative and qualitative , as the biodiversity of the C . leptum was restricted . F . prausnitzii is one of the major members of the C . leptum group ( 18 , 19 ) and one of the most prevalent bacteria within the human gut . In the present study , we showed that a low proportion of F . prausnitzii in the ileal MAM of CD patients at the time of a surgical resection for active disease was a risk factor for endoscopic recurrence 6 months later . Taken together , all these results suggested that F . prausnitzii could be crucial to the gut homeostasis and could have anti - inflammatory properties . F . prausnitzii and its components were then tested on Caco - 2 cells stimulated with IL - 1 (cid:3) . After stimulation by IL - 1 (cid:3) , IL - 8 secretion was not modified by F . prausnitzii and reduced by its supernatant . To better understand the mechanisms involved in this effect , we tested the bacterium components on Caco - 2 cells stably expressing a reporter gene for NF - (cid:4) B . We observed that F . prausnitzii in - creased the IL - 1 (cid:3) - induced NF - (cid:4) B activity , whereas the supernatant abolished it . It is noticeable , that F . prausnitzii DNA did not exhibit any inhibitor effect on either IL - 8 secretion or NF - (cid:4) B activation . Moreover , we showed that this blocking effect on NF - (cid:4) B activation was not due to butyrate . Besides , it is questionable whether the anti - inflammatory effect of the supernatant is shared by an F . prausnitzii - secreted metabo - lite ( s ) or due to an F . prausnitzii - induced change in product ( s ) of the culture medium . The fact that living F . prausnitzii given without supernatant exerts an anti - inflammatory effect in the in vivo experiments favors the hypothesis of secreted metabolite ( s ) - induced effect . Identification of the active molecule ( s ) involved in this protective effect is needed to specify this point . Our results favor a secreted metabolite , which could be involved in inflammatory pathway control . Several targets can be evoked from the lumen to immune cells in the lamina propria , and we first speculated on an antimicrobial peptide ( bacteriocin ) able to modify the gut barrier . However , our in vitro tests did not reveal any antibacterial effect on several anaerobic and aerobic bacteria species . Antibacterial mode of action also could be mediated by stimulation of defensin secretion . In fact , it has been shown that a defect in HD - 5 and HD - 6 (cid:5) - defensin secretion by Paneth cells ( specialized epithelial cells from ileum ) plays a crucial role in ileal CD and could be linked to NOD2 frameshift mutation ( 20 , 21 ) . The clinical part of our study focused on ileal CD patients requiring surgical resection . Thus , the dysbiosis in F . prausnitzii appears attractive regarding the (cid:5) - defensin deficiency concept . As some probiotics have been shown to induce defensin secretion ( 22 ) , a step further will be to investigate the ability of F . prausnitzii to induce such a secretion . Beside a gut barrier effect , our results suggest that a diffusible molecule ( modulin ) could block NF - (cid:4) B activation . More precisely , our data showed that F . prausnitzii supernatant acts as a regulator of the NF - (cid:4) B induction after stimulation by IL - 1 (cid:3) . Nevertheless , the mechanism is probably more complex , because NF - (cid:4) B activation has been shown to play a crucial role in gut homeostasis ( 23 ) . Indeed , F . prausnitzii itself without its superna - tant exerts NF - (cid:4) B induction effect on Caco - 2 cells ( Fig . 3 B ) . However , our data did not support that this mechanism is Toll - like receptor - dependent , because in vivo and in vitro experiments testing different bacteria components ( DNA , membranes , cytosol ) did not show any anti - inflammatory activity . Finally , F . prausnitzii could drive the immune responses toward Th1 pathway inhibition . To evaluate the potential immunomodulatory capacity of F . prausnitzii , we measured the cytokine response of human PBMCs stimulatedbythebacterium . F . prausnitzii hadananti - inflammatory profile because it induced very low secretion levels of IL - 12 and IFN - (cid:2) and high secretion levels of IL - 10 . Moreover , F . prausnitzii has a higher IL10 / IL12 ratio than the probiotic L . salivarius Ls33 strain known to have anti - inflammatory effects . To confirm in vivo the anti - inflammatory effects observed in vitro , we tested F . prausnitzii in a murine TNBS - induced colitis model . F . prausnitzii and its supernatant had a protective effect in this colitis model , on macroscopic and histologic criteria as well as on colonic cytokine secretion profile . Mice treated with either F . prausnitzii or its supernatant had a reduced IL - 12 and an elevated IL - 10 colonic concentration compared with the colitis control group . Interestingly , this effect on cytokine profile is close to the one observed in vitro on PBMCs . To go back to our initial hypothesis , we analyzed the composition of the mouse fecal microbiota by culture - independent methods . We observed that the dysbiosis associated with TNBS - induced colitis was partially counterbalanced by F . prausnitzii or its supernatant administration . Several authors reported that probiotics could act by systemic routes of administration ( 24 – 26 ) . To investigate whether F . prausnitzii can also be active by a gut - independent pathway , we tested it i . p . on a TNBS - induced colitis model . Systemic delivery of F . prausnitzii and , above all , of its supernatant significantly im - proved the survival curve related to TNBS - induced colitis . Here again , this effect was not related to butyrate presence . In summary , a rational process led us to select F . prausnitzii as an anti - inflammatory bacterial candidate . Analysis revealed that F . prausnitzii exhibited anti - inflammatory effects , partly due to se - creted metabolites blocking NF - (cid:4) B activation and IL - 8 secretion . Moreover , in vivo effects were associated with a decrease in proinflammatory colonic cytokine synthesis and with the induction of anti - inflammatory cytokine secretion . Counterbalancing dysbio - sis using the commensal bacterium F . prausnitzii as a candidate probiotic agent appears to be a promising strategy in CD treatment . Nevertheless , clinical studies should establish diagnostic tools to define the best population of patients for this probiotic species , and especially whether the clinical benefit is more pronounced in patients with low levels of endogenous Firmicutes . Materials and Methods Patients . The present study was part of a double - blind controlled trial that comparedtheefﬁciencyoftheprobiotic L . johnsonii LA1strainandaplaceboto decreaseendoscopicrecurrenceaftercurativesurgeryforCD ( 11 ) . Althoughthe whole human trial included 98 patients , the present study , which assessed the MAM , included only a subset of these patients . Tissues , Histological Examination , FISH , and Quantification of Bacteria . Surgical samples and mucosal biopsy samples were processed directly in the operating room as previously described ( 27 ) . Bacterial Culture . F . prausnitzii A2 – 165 ( DSM 17677 ) , isolated from human fecal stool , was grown at 37°C in LYHBHI medium [ Brain – heart infusion medium supplemented with 0 . 5 % yeast extract ( Difco ) and 5 mg / liter hemin ] supple - Sokol et al .

Butyrate Quantification . Butyrate was quantiﬁed in supernatant and culture medium using a gas – liquid chromatograph ( Autosystem XL ; Perkin – Elmer ) as described ( 28 ) . Antibacterial Assay . Antibacterial effect of F . prausnitzii supernatant was inves - tigated in vitro using two different techniques : the critical dilutions of Mayr - Harting ( 14 ) andthebacteriocinactivityassayasdescribed ( 15 ) . Thisantibacterial effectwastestedonsixbacterialspecies : threeaerobicbacteria ( E . coli Nissle1917 , E . coli DH10B , and Listeria monocytogenes 11765 ) , one facultative anaerobic bacteria ( Lactococcus subsp cremoris MG1363 ) , andtwoobligateanaerobicbac - teria ( Clostridium perfringens ATCC13124 and Biﬁdobacterium infantis DSM20088 / ATCC15697 ) . Antibiotic rifampicine and colistine were used as posi - tive controls , whereas LYHBHI medium was used as negative control . PBMCIsolationandStimulation .

Afteracclimatization , bacterialsuspensions ( 10 9 - 10 10 cfuin 500 (cid:6) l ) , bacterialsupernatant , orcontrolmediumwasadministeredtomicedaily by intragastric gavage from day 5 before to day 1 after induction of colitis . For colitis induction , mice were anesthetized with isoﬂuran gas . TNBS ( Sigma – Aldrich ) wasdissolvedin0 . 9 % NaCl / ethanol ( 50 : 50vol / vol ) , and50 (cid:6) lsolution ( at a dose of 100 mg / kg body weight ) was administered intrarectally ( using a 3 . 5 French catheter ; Solomon Scientiﬁc ) , and the mice then were kept in a vertical position for 30 seconds . No - colitis control mice received PBS intragastrically and 0 . 9 % NaCl / ethanol ( 50 : 50 vol / vol ) intrarectally ( 30 ) . Colitis control mice received PBS intragastrically and received TNBS intrarectally . Treated mice received bac - teria ( orbacterialcomponents ) intragastricallyandTNBSintrarectally . Inﬂamma - tion was monitored 48 h after TNBS administration . Mice were weighed before TNBS administration and at killing by cervical dislocation . The i . p . administration route experiments were performed using a protocol derived from the one previously described by Foligne´ et al . ( 24 ) . The protective effect of a single i . p . injection of live microorganisms ( 10 9 - 10 10 cfu in 200 (cid:6) l ) , supernatant ( 200 (cid:6) l ) , dexamethasone ( 10 mg / kg ) , or butyrate ( 40 mM ) was evaluated .
