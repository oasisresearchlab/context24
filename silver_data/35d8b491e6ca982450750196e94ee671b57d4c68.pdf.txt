NAture reviews | GastrOenterOlOGy & HepatOlOGy Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) infection , which causes coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , first emerged in China in December 2019 and has now spread worldwide , with a reported 351 , 731 confirmed cases and 15 , 374 deaths as of 23 March 2020 according to John Hopkins University . The infection is typically characterized by respiratory symptoms , which indicates droplet transmission . However , several case studies have reported gastrointestinal symptoms and / or evidence that some patients with SARS - CoV - 2 infection have viral RNA or live infectious virus present in faeces , which suggests that another possible route might be faecal – oral transmission . In a clinical characterization of ten paediatric patients with SARS - CoV - 2 infection in China , none of whom required respiratory support or intensive care and all of whom lacked signs of pneumonia , eight tested positive on rectal swabs , even after nasopharyngeal testing was negative . The details were published as a Brief Communication in Nature Medicine . The patients , whose ages ranged from 2 months to 15 years , initially tested positive after being screened by nasopharyngeal swab real - time reverse transcrip - tion PCR ( RT – PCR ) . Next , the researchers conducted a series of nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs to investigate the pattern of viral excretion . Eight patients had real - time RT – PCR - positive rectal swabs . In addition , these eight patients had persistently positive rectal swabs even after their nasopharyngeal tests were negative . Four patients were discharged after two consecutive negative rectal swabs , but the rectal swabs of two of these patients later became positive again , despite nasopharyngeal tests remaining negative . Finally , the researchers used the viral RNA measurements to determine that viral shedding from the digestive system might be longer - lasting than that from the respiratory tract . The findings suggest that we also need to use rectal swabs to confirm diagnosis of COVID - 19 , says Kang Zhang , a corresponding author of the study . There had been earlier reports , particularly in adults , of gastro - intestinal symptoms and of the possibility of a faecal – oral route of transmission . In a cohort of 1 , 099 patients with COVID - 19 from 552 hospitals in China , published in the New England Journal of Medicine , 5 . 0 % of patients presented with nausea or vomiting and 3 . 8 % presented with diarrhoea . Also , preliminary findings published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology found that of 204 patients with COVID - 19 ( mean age 54 . 9 years ) who presented to three hospitals in China , 99 ( 48 . 5 % ) patients presented with digestive symptoms as their chief complaint . 60 % of patients without digestive symptoms were cured and discharged , compared with 34 . 3 % of patients with digestive symptoms . In a short Research Letter published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , different tissues of patients with COVID - 19 ( n = 1 , 070 specimens from 205 patients of mean age 44 years ) were tested by RT – PCR . 32 % of pharyngeal swabs ( 126 of 398 ) and 29 % of faecal samples ( 44 of 153 ) tested positive . Electron microscopy of four SARS - CoV - 2 - positive faecal specimens detected live virus in stool samples from two patients who did not have diarrhoea . The precise mechanisms by which SARS - CoV - 2 interacts with the gastrointestinal tract remain unknown . SARS - CoV - 2 is thought to use ACE2 as a viral receptor , and ACE2 mRNA is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal system . In preliminary findings published in Gastroenterology , researchers examined clinical specimens from 73 hospitalized patients with SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 39 patients tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in stool samples . In addition , 17 patients remained positive for SARS - CoV - 2 in stool after becoming negative in respiratory samples . Viral host receptor ACE2 stained positive mostly in gastrointestinal epithelial cells . Together , these findings have implications for our understanding of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . “Asymptomatic children and adults may be shedding infectious virus and they could transmit it . This is another reason to emphasize good personal hygiene , ” says Mary Estes at Baylor College of Medicine , Texas , who was not involved in these studies . “Physicians and caretakers of potentially - infected children need to be aware that stools might be infectious , ” adds Estes . The results are preliminary and further research is needed . “We are now assembling a much larger cohort to confirm our results and will test more patients to confirm faecal – oral transmission , ” says Zhang .
