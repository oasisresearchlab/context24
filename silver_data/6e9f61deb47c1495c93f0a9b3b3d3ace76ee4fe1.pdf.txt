These cell responses to substrate stiffness are linked to substrate - induced changes in the state , localization , and amount of numerous proteins , but detailed evidence for the requirement of speciﬁc proteins in these distinct forms of mechanical response are scarce . Here we use microﬂuidics techniques to produce gels with a gradient of stiffness to show the essential function of ﬁlamin A in cell responses to mechanical stimuli and dissociate cell spreading and stiffening by contrasting responses of a pair of human mela - noma - derived cell lines that differ in expression of this actin cross - linking protein . M2 melanoma cells null for ﬁlamin A do not alter their adherent area in response to increased substrate stiffness when they link to the substrate only through collagen receptors , but change adherent area normally when bound through ﬁbronectin receptors . In contrast , ﬁlamin A - replete A7 cells change adherent area on both substrates and respond more strongly to collagen I - coated gels than to ﬁbronectin - coated gels . Strikingly , A7 cells alter their stiffness , as measured by atomic force microscopy , to match the elastic modulus of the substrate immediately adjacent to them on the gradient . M2 cells , in contrast , maintain a constant stiffness on all substrates that is as low as that of A7 cells on the softest gels examined ( 1000 Pa ) . Comparison of cell spreading and cell stiffening on the same gradient substrates shows that cell spreading is uncoupled from stiffening . At saturating collagen and ﬁbronectin concentrations , adhesion of M2 cells is reduced compared to that of A7 cells to an extent approximately equal to the difference in adherent area . Filamin A appears to be essential for cell stiffening on collagen , but not for cell spreading on ﬁbronectin . These results have implications for different models of cell protrusion and adhesion and identify a key role for ﬁlamin A in altering cellular stiffness that cannot be compensated for by other actin cross - linkers in vivo . INTRODUCTION The mechanical properties of a cell’s microenvironment can have as great an impact on cell structure and function as soluble stimuli and cell - cell contacts ( 1 ) . Many cell types alter their morphology when grown on substrates of different stiffness ( 2 – 8 ) . Cells grown on stiff substrates assemble actin stress ﬁbers ( 5 ) , exhibit a more spread phenotype ( 9 ) , acti - vate signaling pathways characteristic of contractility ( 2 , 10 ) , and upregulate expression of cytoskeletal proteins ( 11 , 12 ) and integrins ( 13 ) . Not all cell types appear to be sensitive to substrate stiffness , and not all mechanosensitive cell types respond similarly to changes in stiffness . However most cell types studied thus far spread more and adhere better to harder matrices . Some cell types cannot grow on very soft ( < 50 Pa ) surfaces ( 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 14 ) , and other cell types such as mesenchymal stem cells survive in a quiescent state when the elastic modulus of their substrates is sufﬁ - ciently low ( 15 ) . Neither the physical nor molecular mechanisms by which cells sense the stiffness of their environments or by which they respond to externally imposed forces are thoroughly understood . A current hypothesis to explain increased spreading on stiffer adhesive surfaces is that by pulling on the matrix at focal adhesions , anchorage points to the under - lying substrate , the cell creates tension within its membrane and underlying cortical actin mesh ( 16 ) ; the tension depends on the inherent material properties of the matrix , a relatively stiff matrix will resist cellular force more than a soft one . In cell types that grow preferentially on hard matrices , the tension will stimulate such a cell to extend its periphery increasing its spread area ( 17 ) . A correlation between cell spreading and stiffening has been reported in ﬁbroblasts ( 12 , 18 ) and can be accounted for by a theoretical model ( 19 ) , but whether cells necessarily stiffen as they spread is not clear . From a physical perspective , cells might sense stiffness by mechanisms analogous to the two design principles of rheometers . In one mechanism , cells could apply a measured stress ( e . g . , using acto - myosin motors ) and detect the amount of deformation ( strain ) imposed on their surroundings . In the other , they could impose a constant strain ( e . g . , by moving a ﬁxed lever arm through a given angle ) and detect the amount of work required . Both mechanisms require an elastic material within the cell that deforms to an extent Submitted October 23 , 2008 , and accepted for publication March 3 , 2009 . Fitzroy J .

Several candidate molecules and signaling pathways have been proposed to constitute the hypothetical force generators and deformation sensors . These include protein phospha - tases ( 20 ) ; small GTPases ; Ca 2 þ channels ; and several cyto - skeletal proteins including talin , ﬁlamin , and dystrophin ( summarized in a recent review ( 21 ) ) . Filamin A is the most efﬁcient actin cross - linking protein in vitro ( 22 – 26 ) , producing elastic networks that cannot be formed by other cross - linkers such as alpha actinin ( 25 , 27 ) or temporary branching proteins such as the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 28 ) . Previous work has shown that loss of ﬁlamin A in a cell line derived from a primary human melanoma decreased the stiffness of these cells by a factor of ~ 2 ( 29 ) and that loss of Dictyostelium ﬁlamin decreases the elastic modulus of these cells ( 30 ) . Loss of ﬁlamin in glomerular podocytes derived from a mouse model of HIV - associated nephropathy ( HIVAN ) is associated with a decrease in the elastic modulus of these cells by a factor of 4 compared to wild - type podo - cytes ( 31 ) . In contrast , studies using magnetic twisting rhe - ometry ( 32 ) report insigniﬁcant mechanical differences in cells devoid of ﬁlamin A compared to their wild - type controls , raising issues as to whether ﬁlamin A or any other actin cross - linker can determine the stiffness of the cytoskel - eton or overall cell stiffness ( 33 ) . In addition to its actin ﬁlament cross - linking function , ﬁl - amin A binds numerous other proteins including some integ - rins to mediate the link between cytoskeleton and cell membrane ( 34 ) . Filamin is speciﬁcally recruited to sites where stress is applied to integrins by magnetic beads coated with collagen , and melanoma cells lacking ﬁlamin cannot mount this mechanoprotective response ( 35 ) . Several protein complexes involved in signaling cytoskeletal reorganization in response to force bind to ﬁlamin A including ras / Erk ( 36 ) , Rho ( 37 ) , and ion channels ( 38 – 42 ) . These data indicate that ﬁlamin A is a good candidate for mediating cellular responses to substrate stiffness , especially responses involving beta 1 integrins that bind ﬁlamin A at their cyto - plasmic tails ( 43 , 44 ) . In this report , we systematically test the role of ﬁlamin A in the response of cells to substrates of different stiffnesses and in the ability of cells to alter their own stiffness to match that of their substrate . EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Fabrication of microﬂuidic channels Gradient generators made from polydimethyl siloxane ( PDMS ) microﬂuidic channels were fabricated using standard photolithography techniques ( 45 , 46 ) . Photomasks of the gradient generator ( Fig . 1 ) were designed in AutoCAD and printed ( Advance Reproductions , North Andover , MA ) . SU - 8 2100 negative photoresist ( Microchem , Newton , MA ) was spin coated onto a silicon wafer , baked for 15 min at 65 (cid:2) C , and then baked again at 95 (cid:2) C for 60 min . The photoresist was exposed to 365 nm ultraviolet ( UV ) light through the photomask to cross - link the exposed parts of the photoresist . A postbake process was then performed at 95 (cid:2) C for 25 min before the coated wafer was immersed in SU - 8 developer for 8 min to remove the uncross - linked parts and leave on the wafer a pattern of the designed micro - ﬂuidic channels called the master . PDMS solution ( Sylgard 184 , Dow Corn - ing , Midland , MI ) was poured over the master and baked at 70 (cid:2) C for 2 h to produce a negative replica of the channels . PDMS was removed from the master and bound to glass coverslips . The gradient - mixer region was bonded to a plain coverslip using a mild oxygen plasma treatment ( 45 W for 40 s ) , and the outlet region was bonded using a high - power ( 75 W ) plasma treatment for 50 s to a coverslip activated with ( 3 - aminopropyl ) tri - methoxysilane ( Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) 281778 ) and glutaraldehyde ( Sigma G7651 ) ( 9 , 46 ) . Activating the coverslip promotes adhesion of polyacryl - amide gels , and the reversible bonding enables separation of the PDMS from the activated coverslip .

Biophysical Journal 96 ( 12 ) 5095 – 5102 5096 Byﬁeld et al . Polyacrylamide gel with stiffness gradients The strategy for making stiffness gradients was developed from the design of Zaari et al ( 46 ) . The stiffness of polyacrylamide gels was tuned by varying the concentration of bisacrylamide at a ﬁxed acrylamide concentration ( 13 ) . Three solutions with the same acrylamide ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) concen - tration but different N , N 0 - methylene - bisacrylamide ( Bio - Rad ) concentra - tions were injected into the gradient generator . Each solution had an acrylamide concentration of 8 % and a 2 , 2 - diethoxyacetophenone ( Sigma 227102 ) photoinitiator concentration of 0 . 5 % . The bisacrylamide concentra - tions of the three inlets were : 0 . 02 % , 0 . 02 % , and 1 % . Fluorescein ( Sigma F6377 ) was added to the 0 . 02 % bis - acrylamide solution to evaluate the gradient of bis - acrylamide concentration upon polymerization ( Fig . 1 b ) . The solutions were then driven through the microﬂuidic channels by syringe pumps ( Harvard Apparatus , Holliston , MA ) at the same ﬂow rate of 3 m L . Once the ﬂow in the outlet channel reached a steady state , a UV light was shined on the outlet region for 8 min . The syringe pumps were stopped after the outlet region was exposed in the UV light for 10 s . Peeling off the PDMS leaves the gel stuck on the activated coverslip . The resulting gel , 1 . 8 mm in width and 2 cm in length , was immediately immersed in PBS buffer for 12 h to remove the unreacted photoinitiators . Once the gradient PA gels were fabricated , stiffness across the gel was characterized using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( Fig . 1 c ) . The gradual transition in bis - acrylamide concentration , which correlates with gel stiff - ness , was also evaluated by ﬂuorescence ( Fig . 1 b ) . The gel surface was then activated with sulfo - SANPAH , and adhesion proteins were covalently ligated through free amino groups by succinimide chemistry ( 47 ) . Previous studies using ﬂuorescently labeled ﬁbronectin and quantifying adhesive ligand density by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( 48 ) show that incubation of 0 . 1 mg / ml protein solutions for 30 min on the gel is sufﬁcient to produce a saturating level of adhesion protein on gels independent of their stiffness . Gradient gels were coated with 0 . 1 mg / ml salmon ﬁbronectin ( Sea Run Holdings , Freeport , ME ) 0 . 1 mg / ml rat - tail collagen ( BD Bioscience , San Diego , CA ) or a combination of both proteins , each at 0 . 1 mg / ml . Ligand density across the coated gradient gel was evaluated using ﬂuores - cence microscopy . Fluorescence images of a gradient gel coated by 0 . 1 mg / ml rhodamine labeled ﬁbronectin were acquired using a Coolsnap Hq charge - coupled device camera ( Roper Scientiﬁc , Trenton , NJ ) mounted on an Axio Observer Z1 microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) . A total of seven images across the gel were taken and stitched together to reconstruct an image of the whole gel . Each image was acquired at a different location of the gel using the same acquisition parameters so that the overlap regions of the images have the same intensity level . A ﬂuorescence intensity proﬁle across the gel was evaluated by plotting the mean intensity of a selected square region , 100 m m 2 in area , against the distance of its centroid from the soft edge of the gel . A constant ﬂuorescence intensity level across the gel ( Fig . 1 c ) indicates uniform distribution of ligand density . Cell culture The M2 cell line was originally identiﬁed in a study of cells cultured from primary and metastatic human melanomas as a cell type with impaired motility ( 49 ) . The abnormal motility and morphology of M2 cells was later shown to be associated with their lack of expression of ABP280 ( 29 ) , the actin cross - linker now called ﬁlamin A ( 50 ) . Whereas motile melanoma cell lines cultured from human tumors had ﬁlamin / actin ratios ranging from 1 : 80 to 1 : 140 , M2 cells had strongly reduced mRNA for ﬁlamin A and no protein detectable by an anti - ﬁlamin A antibody . A7 cells , derived from M2 cells by stable reexpression of ﬁlamin A , have actin levels compa - rable to motile melanoma cells and a ﬁlamin / actin ratio of 1 : 160 , close to the range found in untransfected ﬁlamin A þ melanoma cells ( 29 ) . M2 ( ﬁlamin A deﬁcient ) and A7 ( ﬁlamin A expressing ) melanoma cells were cultured in DMEM ( BioWhittaker , Walkersville , MD ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone , Logan , UT ) at 37 (cid:2) C with 5 % CO2 . Acrylamide gels , either single stiffness or stiffness gradients , were prepared for cell culture by coating with 0 . 5 mg / ml sulfo - SANPAH ( Pierce Biotech - nology , Rockford , IL ) and activated using UV for 10 min . Cells were then added to gels coated with adhesion proteins as described above and allowed to attach and spread for 24 h before experiments were performed . Immedi - ately before experimentation , cells were placed in CO 2 independent buffer ( PBS þ Ca , þ Mg ) to prevent changes in pH of the cellular environment . AFM and ﬂuorescent microscopy AFM was done with a DAFM - 2X Bioscope ( Veeco , Woodbury , NY ) mounted on an Axiovert 100 microscope ( Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) using silicon nitride cantilevers ( 196 m m long , 23 m m wide , 0 . 6 m m thick ) with a bead tip ( 1 m m diameter ) for indentation . The spring constant of the canti - lever , calibrated by resonance measurements , was typically 0 . 06 N / m ( Novascan , Ames , IA ) . A grid with 300 m m divisions was placed length - wise beneath the gel , and ~ 3 – 4 cell / gel stiffness measurements are made within each division . Correlation between cell and gel stiffness was deter - mined by indenting the cells at three distinct points and the gel at three points proximal to the attached cell . To quantify stiffness ( elastic modulus ) , the ﬁrst 500 nm of tip deﬂection was ﬁt with the Hertz model for a sphere f bead ¼ k (cid:3) d cantilever ¼ 4 3 E 1 (cid:4) v 2 ﬃﬃﬃ R p d 3 2 where f bead is the force on the bead , k is the spring constant of the cantilever , d cantilever is the deﬂection of the cantilever measured by the AFM , E is the Young’s modulus , v is the Poisson ratio , R is the radius of the bead , and d is the vertical indentation of the material . d is determined by subtracting d cantilever from the distance traveled by the cantilever during the indentation process . Previous studies have shown that this simple approximation , although not exact for our conditions , is correct within a small fraction ( < 15 % ) of values determined by conventional rheometry of identical gels ( 51 ) . Phase contrast images of cells , including those measured by AFM , were analyzed using Image J to determine adherent area . For evaluation of actin organization of M2 and A7 cells on varying gel stiffness , samples were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) for 30 min at 37 (cid:2) and stained with 1 : 40 FITC - labeled phal - loidin ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) in PBS for 30 min . Measurement of cell adhesion Equal numbers of M2 and A7 cells ( two 10 4 cells / well ) were plated in trip - licate wells of 96 - well plates . Groups of wells contained serial dilutions of collagen or ﬁbronectin ranging from 0 – 10 m g / ml . The cells were allowed to adhere to the wells for 30 min in a tissue culture incubator . After 30 min , the plates were washed , and the cells that remained were stained with crystal violet . The plates were dried and the stain solubilized with meth - anol - acetic acid , and the plates read in a microplate reader ( 52 ) . RESULTS The speciﬁc function of ﬁlamin A in the ability of cells to sense or respond to substrate stiffness is illustrated by comparison of the two human melanoma - derived cell lines M2 and A7 ( 29 ) . M2 cells are derived from a primary human melanoma , and although transformed and robust in culture have highly impaired motility because they lack ﬁlamin A expression ( Fig . 2 e ) . A7 cells are derived from M2 cells by stably expressing approximately wild - type levels of ﬁla - min A . A typical response of A7 cells to the changes in stiff - ness within a gradient gel coated with ﬁbronectin and collagen is shown in Fig . 2 a . On the softest region of the gel , which has a Young’s modulus of ~ 1 kPa , measured by small amplitude indentation at a frequency of 1 HZ , A7 cells Biophysical Journal 96 ( 12 ) 5095 – 5102 Filamin A and Stiffness Sensing 5097 are round and lack actin bundles or stress ﬁbers that are visible by ﬂuorescence microscopy after staining with rhoda - mine - phalloidin . As stiffness increases to levels of ~ 30 kPa on the right side of the gel shown , the A7 cells develop a spread , fan - shaped morphology and assemble actin bundles ( Fig . 2 , a and f ) . These morphological changes are very similar to those seen in ﬁbroblasts and other cell types . M2 cells form few if any stress ﬁbers on any gel at any level of stiffness under these conditions ( Fig . 2 , b and g ) . Function of ﬁlamin in response to substrate stiffness Thepotentialof ﬁlaminAtomediatetheintegrin - speciﬁcstiff - ness sensing - response function of cells is demonstrated by the data in Fig . 3 . When A7 cells are cultured on gels coated with collagen I , ﬁbronectin , or a combination of both proteins , they increase both their own cortical stiffness ( Fig . 3 a ) and their adherent area ( Fig . 3 c ) butto verydifferentextents , depending on the nature of the adhesive ligand . Cell stiffness is greater and increases more strongly with substrate stiffness when A7 cells are grown on collagen I , and like ﬁbroblasts ( 51 ) , these cell types modulate their cytoskeletal stiffness to match that of their underlying substrate . A7 cell stiffening on ﬁbro - nectin is much more gradual , and when plated on both ligands , the cellular response is intermediate between those of either ligand alone . This result suggests that activation of ﬁbronectin receptors , presumably b 3 integrins , interferes with the response to collagen receptors , presumably b 1 integrins . Direct comparison of spread area and cell stiffness for the same population of cells shows that spreading and stiffening are not linked , and in the case of A7 cells show opposite responses to changes in adhesive ligand . Whereas A7 cells were stiffest on collagen , their spread area was the same on collgen - coated and ﬁbronectin - coated gels ( Fig . 3 c ) and gels with both collagen and ﬁbronectin lead to spread FIGURE 2 Morphological change of melanoma cells on stiffness gradient gels .

Scale bar is 40 m m . The full width of the gel is 1 . 8 mm , and its stiffness ranges from 1 to 30 kPa .

The coating density of both collagen and ﬁbro - nectin was sufﬁciently high to be saturating for both collagen and ﬁbronectin , as determined by previous studies and conﬁrmed by the data of Fig . 4 . Filamin - A null M2 cells responded very differently to changes in substrate stiffness that again depended on the nature of the adhesive ligand . Fig . 3 b shows that M2 cells maintain a constant low value of cytoskeletal stiffness inde - pendent of the stiffness of their substrate . There appears to be a slight trend toward stiffening on collagen , but not on ﬁbronectin . However , like A7 cells , M2 cells increased their spread area as the stiffness increased on gels that contained ﬁbronectin , consistent with a previous report ( 48 ) , but not on collagen alone . These ﬁndings are consistent with reports that ﬁlamin might be the primary cytoskeletal linker to integ - rin subtypes that promote tight adhesion and inhibit motility , whereas ﬁlamin A might be replaced by talin as the cytoskel - etal linker when the cell binds ﬁbronectin and initiates amotile phenotype ( 43 ) . Similar to ﬁbroblasts ( 51 ) , A7 cells alter their stiffness to match that of their substrate when bound by collagen receptors , but have a much weaker stiffening response when bound to ﬁbronectin - coated gels ( Fig . 3 a ) . M2 cells maintain their low elastic modulus on all substrates ( Fig . 3 b ) . The stiffness values reported here were determined by AFM indentation of gradient gels , with the AFM probing both the cell and the adjacent substrate . Absence of ﬁlamin weakens but does not prevent adhesion to collagen - or ﬁbronectin - coated surfaces Changes in spread area and potentially cell stiffness might result from differences in the ability of cells to adhere to their substrate . To test for differences in adhesion strength inde - pendent of stiffness differences , M2 and A7 cells were plated on plastic surfaces coated with serial dilutions of collagen I FIGURE 3 Cellular stiffness measured by AFM ( a and b ) and adherent area ( c and d ) of A7 ( a , c ) and M2 ( b and d ) melanoma cells cultured for 24 h on polyacryl - amide gels laminated with collagen I ( circles ) , ﬁbronectin ( triangles ) , or mixture of collagen I and ﬁbronectin ( diamonds ) . Both proteins were added at saturating concentrations to the gels using methods described in ( 47 ) . Error bars representing standard errors ( n ¼ 3 ) for stiffness measurements of individual cells and the adjacent gel shown in panel a are representative for data in panels a and b . Error bars in panels c and d represent larger pop - ulations of cells ( n ¼ 30 – 50 ) within gels of the average stiffness shown on the abscissa . FIGURE 4 Adhesion strength of M2 and A7 cells to surfaces coated with different densities of ﬁbronectin and collagen . Relative cell adhesion strength is calculated as the intensity of cell staining on surfaces after non - adherent cells are removed by washing with medium . Biophysical Journal 96 ( 12 ) 5095 – 5102 Filamin A and Stiffness Sensing 5099 or ﬁbronectin . Adherent cells were subjected to uniform ﬂuid shear stress and their abilities to maintain adhesion on surfaces coated with different densities of ﬁbronectin or collagen I are shown in Fig . 4 . At the densities of ligand used for the studies shown in Fig . 3 ( > 10 m g / ml ) M2 cells’ adhesion strength is ~ 60 % that of A7 cells on both types of ligands . Previous studies show that total adhesion strength scales with the number of ligated integrins ( 53 ) , and therefore at saturating adhesion protein densities , approximately with the adherent area . The M2 cells have a clear adhesion defect on collagen compared to the A7 cells . At the maximum ﬁbronectin concentration , the adhesion of A7 is similar to that of A7 cells on collagen , and adhesion of the M2 cells is similar to that of the M2 cells on collagen . Even though M2 cells spread better on ﬁbro - nectin than collagen ( Fig . 3 d ) to the point that their spreading behavior approaches that of A7 cells , their adhesive properties remain defective compared to A7 cells . The difference in adhesion strength between M2 and A7 cells is consistent with their differences in adherent area on the stiffest substrates shown in Fig . 3 , suggesting that both cell types are able to engage their substrate effectively , but the lack of spreading leads to overall less adhesion . The lack of ﬁlamin A , presum - ably needed for coupling the membrane receptors to the cyto - skeleton , leads to differences in stiffening and spreading as substrate stiffness is altered . DISCUSSION The stiffness of tissues is tightly controlled , and the elastic modulus of most normal tissues generally ranges from ~ 100 Pa for the softest tissues , such as fat and bone marrow , to tens of thousands of Pa for muscle , and an order of magni - tude greater for cartilage and tissues such as bone that are composed more of extracellular matrix than of cells ( reviewed in ( 54 ) ) . The stiffening of tissues resulting from ﬁbrosis or other diseases is commonly thought to be merely an inevitable late - stage consequence of the pathologic process , but recent work supports the hypothesis that changes in tissue stiffness have a more active , causative role in disease , as they can exacerbate or even initiate cellular changes coincident with chemical signaling ( 2 , 55 , 56 ) . The molecular determinants of cellular and extracellular matrix elasticity are extensively studied , but a universally accepted model to explain how changes in protein assembly and orga - nization translate into macroscopic or microscopic elasticity has been elusive . Intracellular elasticity is generally thought to rely on the formation of cytoskeletal networks , especially the cortical actin meshwork , a dynamic system of polymer - izing and depolymerizing ﬁlaments cross - linked to each other and to the plasma membrane by a host of actin binding proteins . The relative efﬁciency of different puriﬁed actin cross - linkers has been documented in vitro , and ﬁlamin A is consistently found to be the most efﬁcient cross - linker , not only in terms of forming actin ﬁlament networks , but also of inducing stiffening of these networks as they deform ( 25 , 28 ) . Whether or not ﬁlamin A is essential for stiffness sensing appears to depend on the context , with different studies reporting that ﬁlamin A expression is either essential ( 35 , 57 ) or unnecessary ( 48 , 58 ) for cellular response to changes in stiffness or response to external forces . Cellular responses to matrix stiffness depend not only on the cell type and its expression of cytoskeletal protein but also on the types of extracellular matrix and therefore the type of adhesion receptors expressed , usually integrins , by which the cell binds its substrate . Previous studies have shown that ﬁbroblasts , endothelial cells , and several other cell types all increase in spread area as a function of substrate stiffness , but to different extents , depending on whether they bind through collagen , ﬁbronectin , or laminin receptors ( 1 ) . Similarly , the data in Figs . 2 and 3 show that melanoma cells , whether or not they express ﬁlamin A , respond differently to ﬁbronectin - and collagen - coated surfaces , but that spreading , stiffening , and adhesion ( Fig . 4 ) on collagen - coated surfaces shows an absolute requirement for ﬁlamin A . The results in Fig . 3 are consistent with and help explain the apparently discrepant results of two studies of me - chano - sensing in ﬁlamin - deﬁcient melanoma cells . Glogauer et al . ( 35 ) showed that ﬁlamin - expressing A7 cells increased actin assembly and activated myosin contractility at sites where magnetic collagen - coated beads applied force to the surface of the cell , whereas M2 cells , devoid of ﬁlamin , did not . In contrast , Giannone et al . ( 58 ) reported that M2 cells responded nearly normally to force application by ﬁbro - nectin - coated beads , whereas deletion of talin abolished the response to force in this system . Because talin , but not ﬁla - min , activates b 3 integrins ( 59 ) , the receptors for ﬁbronectin in most cell types ( 60 ) the mechanosensing required for shape changes ( spreading ) in response to substrate stiffness is intact in M2 cells on an Fn matrix . However , when the only adhesive ligand is collagen , which engages largely b 1 integrin that binds primarily to ﬁlamin A , the mechanosens - ing in ﬁlamin A - deﬁcient cells is abolished , and they do not spread , stiffen , or adhere normally . It is notable that although talin appears to be able to compete with ﬁlamin for b 1 integ - rins ( 44 ) , it alone is not capable of transmitting or trans - ducing the collagen and integrin b 1 - dependent signal required for shape change ( spreading ) in response to stiffness differences . The data in Fig . 3 also show that cell spreading and stiff - ening can be independently controlled . This ﬁnding has implications for differentiating among different models of how cells adhere to and move on surfaces . Several studies suggest that application of internal tension ( prestress ) is required for a cell to spread , and that a consequence of prestress is stiffening of the cytoskeleton . This mechanism is inconsistent with the data in Fig . 3 a and c , which show that A7 cells stiffen more on collagen than on ﬁbronectin , but spread equally well on ﬁbronectin or collagen . Alterna - tive models posit that cortical tension , and therefore a stiffer Biophysical Journal 96 ( 12 ) 5095 – 5102 5100 Byﬁeld et al . cell , counters cell spreading and that softening of the cyto - skeleton alters the balance between cytoskeletal elasticity and membrane adhesion energy , allowing the cell to spread more . The data in Figs . 3 and 4 also indicate that adhesion strength and spreading can be dissociated , because despite increased spreading of M2 cells on ﬁbronectin compared to collagen ( Fig . 3 d ) , their adhesive properties on collagen and ﬁbronectin are similar . The different responses to ﬁbro - nectin - and collagen - coated gels are consistent with a model by which activation of the integrins speciﬁc for these ligands initiates signals that support different cellular functions with different requirements for plasticity and solidity . The ﬁnding that the combination of collagen and ﬁbronectin produces a greater spread area than either ligand alone ( Fig . 3 c ) , but a stiffness intermediate between that of each ligand sepa - rately ( Fig . 3 a ) suggests that ligation of the Fn receptor might promote cell softening , whereas ligation to collagen promotes stiffening , without a change in adherent area . The differential behavior of cells on matrices with different compositions ( collagen versus ﬁbronectin ) may also have implications for the behavior of cells in wounds and in response to inﬂammation .
