The cell wall primarily functions to prevent the cell from over - expansion when exposed to water , and is a porous material distributed with nanosized pores on it . In this paper , we study the deformation of a membrane patch by an osmotic pressure through a nanopore on the cell wall . We find that there exists a critical pore size beyond which the membrane cannot stand against the pressure and would inflate out through the pore . The critical pore size scales exponentially with the membrane tension and the spontaneous curvature , and exhibits a power law dependence on the osmotic pressure . Our results also show that the liquid membrane expansion by pressure is mechanically different from the solid balloon expansion , and predict that the bending rigidity of the membrane in walled cells should be larger than that of the mammalian cells so as to prevent inflation through the pores on the cell wall . Introduction 1 The cell wall is a structure that surrounds the cells of many organisms , including 2 plants , fungi , bacteria , and some protists [ 1 ‚Äì 4 ] . It is a rigid layer that provides support , 3 protection , and shape to the cell . In plants , the cell wall is composed primarily of 4 cellulose , a polysaccharide made up of glucose units [ 5 ] . The cell wall of fungi is 5 composed of chitin , a polymer of N - acetylglucosamine [ 6 , 7 ] . Bacterial cell walls are 6 made up of peptidoglycan , a polymer of amino sugars and amino acids [ 8 , 9 ] . The cell 7 wall plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the cell and protecting it 8 from mechanical stress , osmotic pressure , and other environmental factors . 9 Basically , the cell wall is a porous structure that allows for the exchange of materials 10 between the cell and its environment . The size and shape of the pores in the cell wall 11 can vary depending on the type of cell and the function of the wall . For example , in the 12 primary cell wall of plant cells , the size of the pores can range from 10 - 20 nanometers to 13 several micrometers in diameter , with the largest pores often found at the corners where 14 adjacent cells meet [ 10 , 11 ] . In fungal cell walls , the size of the pores can also vary , but 15 is typically at an order of a few tens of nanometers [ 12 , 13 ] . 16 Walled cells generally have a high osmotic pressure that allows them to grow and 17 survive in the environment [ 14 ‚Äì 19 ] . The osmotic pressure pushes the plasma membrane 18 1 / 14 against the cell wall and therefore prevents some important biological process from 19 happening . In particular , endocytosis which involves the internalization of a small patch 20 of plasma membrane is hindered by the osmotic pressure [ 20 ] . In fission yeast , the turgor 21 pressure is estimated to be 0 . 85 ¬± 0 . 15 MPa by measuring the growth curve of a mutant 22 yeast cell against a PDMS chamber [ 21 , 22 ] . In another experiment which compares the 23 geometry of a fission yeast cell upon osmolarity change , it is estimated that the turgor 24 pressure is up to 1 . 5 ¬± 0 . 2 MPa [ 14 ] . Based on a similar osmolarity variation method , 25 the value of turgor pressure is estimated to be 0 . 6 ¬± 0 . 2 MPa in budding yeast [ 23 ] . In 26 general , the turgor pressure in yeast cells have an order of magnitude 0 . 1 ‚àí 1 MPa . 27 In this work , we study membrane deformation through a nanopore on the cell wall 28 by the osmotic pressure with the Helfrich model . We find that when the pore is small , 29 the membrane assumes a certain shape to resist the osmotic pressure . When gradually 30 increasing the pore size beyond a critical value , the membrane cannot stand against 31 the pressure anymore and would inflate out through the pore and further expand . We 32 systematically study how the critical pore size R crit depends on the membrane properties 33 and find that R crit scales exponentially with the membrane tension and the spontaneous 34 curvature , but scales with the osmotic pressure with a power law . We show that the 35 expansion of a liquid membrane by pressure is different from a solid one in terms of 36 their p - V curve . Our results suggest that the membrane bending rigidity in walled cells 37 should be larger than that in mammalian cells so as to prevent the cell from inflation 38 through the nanopores present on the cell wall . 39 Fixed - hinge a b Cell wall Inside p z r ùúì Cell wall u = 0 u = 1 u = 1 u = 0 Cell wall Inside Cell wall z r ùúì p Free - hinge P Cell wall Cell membrane Pore on the cell wall Protein V œÉ œÉ Figure 1 . Schematic illustration of a typical yeast cell and the model . ( a ) Illustration of the typical morphology of a fission yeast cell . A nanopore ( red frame ) is present on the cell wall ( gray ) and the membrane ( green ) is pushed outwards by the osmotic pressure p . The size of the nanopore is exaggerated for the purpose of illustration only . ( b ) Illustration of the membrane models . The membrane shape is assumed to be axisymmetric with respect to the z - axis , and parameterized by its meridinal coordinates [ r ( u ) , z ( u ) ] with u = 0 labeling the membrane tip and u = 1 labeling the membrane edge . Two types of boundary conditions ( BCs ) are considered , namely the free - hinge BC ( left ) in which the membrane is allowed to freely rotate at the pore edge and the fixed - hinge BC ( right ) in which the membrane angle is fixed . The proteins ( orange ) coated on the membrane are assumed to generate the spontaneous curvature of the membrane . 2 / 14 Methods 40 Model 41 We consider a walled cell with a high osmotic pressure p that pushes the cell membrane 42 against the cell wall . A nanopore with a radius of R pore is present on the cell wall , 43 which has a much larger Young‚Äôs modulus than the osmotic pressure and a much smaller 44 curvature than the nanopore [ 24 ‚Äì 27 ] . The cell wall is therefore modeled as a rigid and 45 flat substrate . We assume the deformation of the membrane at the pore is axisymmetric , 46 and parameterized with its meridional coordinates [ r ( u ) , z ( u ) ] , where u ‚àà [ 0 , 1 ] is the 47 rescaled arclength . The point at u = 0 labels the membrane tip and the points at u = 1 48 label the membrane edge ( Fig . 1b ) . The coordinates satisfy the geometric relations 49 r (cid:48) = h cos œà , z (cid:48) = ‚àí h sin œà . ( 1 ) Hereafter , we use f (cid:48) to denote the derivative of an arbitrary function f with respect to 50 u . The angle œà ( u ) spans between the tangential direction and the horizontal direction . 51 The constant h is essentially the total arclength of the membrane profile and is to be 52 solved with the shape equations . The total energy of the membrane reads 53 G = Œ∫ 2 (cid:90) ( c 1 + c 2 ‚àí c 0 ) 2 dA + œÉA + pV , ( 2 ) where the first term is the classical Helfrich bending energy with Œ∫ denoting the bending 54 rigidity of the membrane , c 1 = Àô œà / h and c 2 = sin œà / r the two principal curvatures of 55 the membrane surface , c 0 denoting the spontaneous curvature induced by curvature - 56 generating proteins coated on the membrane [ 28 , 29 ] . In the absence of proteins , the 57 spontaneous curvature is assumed to vanish . The second term in Eq . ( 2 ) is the surface 58 tension energy with A denoting the surface area of the deformed membrane , and œÉ 59 denoting the membrane tension at the edge of the pore . The third term describes the 60 effect of the osmotic pressure with V being the increased volume of the membrane due to 61 inflation , and p denoting the osmotic pressure ( Fig . 1a ) . Due to the rotational symmetry 62 of the membrane shape about the z axis , the total energy of the membrane in Eq . ( 2 ) 63 can be expressed as a functional of the shape variables 64 G = 2 œÄ (cid:90) 1 0 L [ œà , œà (cid:48) , r , r (cid:48) , z , z (cid:48) , h , Œ≥ , Œ∑ ] du . ( 3 ) Here Œ≥ , Œ∑ are Lagrangian multipliers that enforce the geometric relations in Eq . ( 1 ) . The 65 shape equations of the membrane are obtained by applying variations of the free energy 66 G with respect to all the shape variables [ 30 , 31 ] . The variation Œ¥G contains both bulk 67 terms , e . g . , [ ‚àÇL / ‚àÇœà ‚àí d ( ‚àÇL / ‚àÇœà (cid:48) ) / du ] Œ¥œà , and boundary terms , e . g . , ( ‚àÇL / ‚àÇœà (cid:48) ) Œ¥œà | u = 1 u = 0 . 68 We obtain the shape equations by having the bulk terms to be zero . In addition , proper 69 boundary conditions ( BCs ) at the membrane tip u = 0 and at the pore edge u = 1 need 70 to be specified , which can be achieved by setting the boundary terms in Œ¥G to be zero . 71 There are two types of BCs , the free - hinge BC in which the membrane angle œà is allowed 72 to freely rotate , and the fixed - hinge BC in which the membrane angle œà is fixed to be 0 73 ( Fig . 1b ) . They correspond to have either ‚àÇL / ‚àÇœà (cid:48) = 0 or Œ¥œà = 0 in the boundary term . 74 The detailed derivation of the shape equations and the BCs is provided in the appendix . 75 We numerically solve the shape equations with the bvp4c solver in MATLAB , which is 76 designed for solving boundary value problems ( BVPs ) of ordinary differential equations . 77 3 / 14 Results 78 Critical pore size for membrane inflation scales exponentially 79 with the membrane tension and spontaneous curvature . 80 In this section , we fix the osmotic pressure p and study how the membrane is deformed 81 when gradually increasing the pore radius R pore . The osmotic pressure p and the 82 membrane bending rigidity Œ∫ define a characteristic length R p = ( Œ∫ / 2 p ) 1 / 3 , which is 83 used to rescale the length , and nondimensionalize all the other parameters . In particular , 84 the rescaled pressure ¬Ø p = pR 3p / Œ∫ = 0 . 5 is a constant . The other nondimensionalized 85 parameters include the rescaled tension ¬Ø œÉ = œÉR 2p / Œ∫ , and the rescaled spontaneous 86 curvature ¬Ø c 0 = c 0 R p . 87 We first consider a membrane without any curvature - generating proteins and study 88 how the membrane is deformed when continuously increasing the radius of the pore 89 R pore under a constant membrane tension ¬Ø œÉ = 0 . 001 . The membrane is pushed down by 90 the pressure p to a depth of D pore . It is found in the D pore ‚àí R pore curve , a single value 91 of the pore radius R pore corresponds to two membrane shapes ( squares and circles in 92 Fig . 2 c ) , one with a shallow depth and the other with a deep one . By comparing the 93 total energy of the two shapes ( Fig . 2 b ) , we see that the energy of the shallow solution 94 is much lower than that of the deep one , indicating an energetically more favorable state 95 of the membrane . For the shallow shapes , the depth of the membrane is pushed further 96 down by the pressure as the pore size is enlarged , while for the deep shapes , the depth 97 of the membrane shows a nonmonotonic relation with the pore radius . There exists a 98 critical pore size R crit beyond which no solutions are found , which indicates that the 99 osmotic pressure is too strong for any membrane shape to sustain the pressure . The 100 membrane would continuously inflate out of the pore and expand over time if there is 101 constant supply of lipid molecules flowing into the pore from the edge . 102 We then plot the D pore vs . R pore curves for different membrane tensions ¬Ø œÉ ( Fig . 2 ) d . 103 The critical pore size ¬Ø R crit is found to strongly depend on the membrane tension ¬Ø œÉ . For 104 ¬Ø œÉ < 0 . 1 , the critical radius ¬Ø R crit stays around 2 . Beyond ¬Ø œÉ = 0 . 1 , ¬Ø R crit has a dramatic 105 increase with ¬Ø œÉ ( Fig . 2e , green dotted curve ) . The relationship can be nicely fitted with 106 an exponential function ( Fig . 2 e , cyan dashed curve ) . 107 We next consider a membrane totally coated by proteins and study the effect of spon - 108 taneous curvature c 0 induced by the proteins on the membrane deformation , particularly 109 on the critical pore radius . The D pore ‚àí R pore curve for a coated membrane with positive 110 ¬Ø c 0 show a similar trend with that of the uncoated membrane , i . e . , a single pore radius 111 corresponding to two solutions , one with a lower energy and the other with a higher one 112 ( Fig . 3a , b ) . However , solutions with negative depth appear for small pore radii in the 113 lower energy branch due to the positive spontaneous curvature c 0 that tends to bend the 114 membrane inward against the osmotic pressure ( Fig . 3a ) . When the pore radius becomes 115 large , the spontaneous curvature c 0 cannot resist the osmotic pressure anymore and the 116 membrane is pushed outward by the pressure ( Fig . 3c ) . The D pore ‚àí R pore curves for 117 different spontaneous curvatures c 0 are shown in Fig . 3d . The critical radius increases 118 with the spontaneous curvature and the relationship can be well fitted by an exponential 119 function ( Fig . 3e ) . 120 Critical pressure for membrane inflation scales with the pore ra - 121 dius with a power law 122 In this section , we fix the pore radius and study how an uncoated membrane is deformed 123 by gradually increasing the osmotic pressure p . The membrane tension œÉ and the 124 membrane bending rigidity Œ∫ defines a characteristic length R œÉ = [ Œ∫ / ( 2 œÉ ) ] 1 / 2 , which is 125 4 / 14 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 - 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 3 . 5 4 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 1 2 3 4 - 2 - 1 0 1 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 1 2 3 4 - 2 - 1 0 1 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 1 2 3 4 - 2 - 1 0 1 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 0 5 10 15 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 a b c d e Figure 2 .

In particular , 126 the membrane tension can be rescaled to a constant ¬Ø œÉ = œÉR 2 œÉ / Œ∫ = 0 . 5 . The rescaled 127 osmotic pressure is ¬Ø p = pR 3 œÉ / Œ∫ . 128 A typical ¬Ø D pore vs . ¬Ø p curve is shown in Fig . 4a . A single osmotic pressure ¬Ø p can find 129 two corresponding depths on the curve ( Fig . 4 ) , with the shallow one having a lower 130 energy and the deep one having a higher energy ( Fig . 4b , c ) . We stress that for small 131 osmotic pressure p , the high energy branch can have a very large depth . This is similar 132 to the p - V curve of an inflating balloon [ 32 ‚Äì 36 ] . When the osmotic pressure is a beyond 133 a critical value , no solutions are found . It implies that the osmotic pressure is too large 134 for any membrane shape to sustain the pressure . The membrane would inflate out of the 135 pore to form a bulge . The critical pressure ¬Ø p crit is found to increase with the pore radius 136 ( Fig . 4d ) , and the relationship can be well fitted with a power law ¬Ø p crit = 6 . 978 R ‚àí 2 . 899 pore 137 ( Fig . 4e ) . 138 Discussion 139 The critical pore size is about 10 nm given the typical parameters 140 of the membrane 141 We have shown that if a nanopore is present on the cell wall and the pore radius is small , 142 the membrane is able to resist the osmotic pressure by assuming a curved shape . If the 143 pore radius is beyond a critical value R crit , no membrane shapes are able to sustain the 144 osmotic pressure and the membrane would inflate out and further expand . In Fig . 5 , we 145 show how the critical pore size depends on the model parameters , given the typical value 146 of the membrane properties . The model parameters include the bending rigidity Œ∫ , the 147 membrane tension œÉ , the osmotic pressure p , and the spontaneous curvature c 0 . We fix 148 three of them to the typical values ( listed on the top of each panel in Fig . 5 ) , and vary 149 the fourth one to see how it impacts the critical pore size R crit using the fitted expression 150 ¬Ø R crit = 2 . 516 exp ( 0 . 518¬Ø œÉ ) for the free - hinge BC and ¬Ø R crit = 3 . 468 exp ( 0 . 434¬Ø œÉ ) for the 151 fixed - hinge BC . The critical pore size R crit is found to decrease with the osmotic pressure 152 and increase with the other three parameters , and stays in the range of 5 ‚àí 20 nm . 153 In general , R crit is smaller under the free - higne BC than that under the fixed hinge 154 BC . As we have pointed out , the typical pore size of the cell wall is about tens of 155 nanometers [ 10 ‚Äì 13 ] , which is comparable to the critical pore size calculated by our theory 156 ( Fig . 5b ) . Our calculation therefore implies that the bending rigidity of the walled cells 157 must be higher than the value 20 kT we have typically assumed . This is plausible based 158 on the experimental evidence that the membrane is surrounded with actin meshwork 159 in yeast cells [ 37 ‚Äì 39 ] , which is able to effectively increase the bending rigidity of the 160 membrane . Furthermore , proteins on the membrane are also help to increase the bending 161 rigidity . 162 Liquid membrane versus solid balloon 163 In Fig . 4 , we have presented the results for the membrane deformation when gradually 164 increasing the osmotic pressure . The D pore vs . ¬Ø p curve is found to be nonmonotic , which 165 resembles the p - V curve of an inflating balloon [ 32 ‚Äì 36 ] . In practice , the setup shown in 166 Fig . 4 is used to measure the elastic properties of solid polymer materials , such as rubber . 167 However , for the solid balloon , in particular , at very large volume , the p - V curve would 168 increase with the pressure again due to the stretching energy of the rubber that makes 169 up the balloon . In our case , we consider an incompressible liquid membrane and the 170 membrane area increase is due to the lipid flow from the pore edge when the membrane 171 is pushed by the osmotic pressure .

Therefore , we can find deep invaginations at very small 173 pressure , which differs the liquid membrane from the solid balloon . 174 Conclusion 175 We have studied membrane inflation through a nanopore on the cell wall in the presence 176 of a high osmotic pressure . It is found that there exists a critical value of the pore size 177 R crit beyond which the membrane cannot stand against the osmotic pressure and would 178 inflate out through the pore and keep expansion . The critical pore size R crit scales 179 exponentially with the membrane tension œÉ and the spontaneous curvature c 0 , and scales 180 with the osmotic pressure p with a power law . The boundary conditions at the pore edge 181 also make a quantitative difference . In general , the fixed - hinge BC leads to a larger R crit 182 than the free - hinge BC . Our results also reveal that the inflation of a liquid membrane 183 by pressure behaves differently than that of a solid balloon . In walled cells where the 184 osmotic pressure is high , the membrane should have a large bending rigidity than that 185 in mammalian cells to prevent from inflation through the pores on the cell wall . 186 Appendix 187 Derivation of the membrane shape equations 188 In order to derive the membrane shape equations , we explicitly express the integrand L 189 in Eq . ( 3 ) as 190 L = 1 2 Œ∫ (cid:18) œà (cid:48) h + sinœà r ‚àí c 0 (cid:19) 2 rh + p 2 r 2 h sin œà + œÉhr + Œ≥ ( u ) ( r (cid:48) ‚àí h cos œà ) + Œ∑ ( u ) ( z (cid:48) + h sin œà ) . ( 4 ) Here the three terms in the first line describe the energy contribution made by the 191 bending rigidity , the surface tension , and the osmotic pressure , respectively , and the two 192 terms in the second line describe the Lagrangian multiplies Œ≥ ( u ) and Œ∑ ( u ) to enforce the 193 geometric constraints Eq . ( 1 ) . The variation of the functional G in Eq . ( 3 ) reads 194 Œ¥G 2 œÄ = (cid:90) 1 0 du (cid:20)(cid:18) ‚àÇL ‚àÇœà ‚àí d du ‚àÇL ‚àÇœà (cid:48) (cid:19) Œ¥œà + (cid:18) ‚àÇL ‚àÇr ‚àí d du ‚àÇL ‚àÇr (cid:48) (cid:19) Œ¥r + (cid:18) ‚àÇL ‚àÇz ‚àí d du ‚àÇL ‚àÇz (cid:48) (cid:19) Œ¥z (cid:21) + (cid:90) 1 0 du (cid:20) ‚àÇL ‚àÇŒ≥ Œ¥Œ≥ + ‚àÇL ‚àÇŒ∑ Œ¥Œ∑ + ‚àÇL ‚àÇh Œ¥h (cid:21) + ‚àÇL ‚àÇœà (cid:48) Œ¥œà (cid:12)(cid:12) u = 1 u = 0 + ‚àÇL ‚àÇr (cid:48) Œ¥r (cid:12)(cid:12) u = 1 u = 0 + ‚àÇL ‚àÇz (cid:48) Œ¥z (cid:12)(cid:12) u = 1 u = 0 . ( 5 ) The variation contains both the bulk terms ( first and second lines ) and the boundary 195 terms ( third line ) . By letting the bulk terms equal to zero , we obtain a set of ordinary 196 differential equations , which include a second - order equation 197 œà (cid:48)(cid:48) = h 2 cos œà sin œà r 2 ‚àí œà (cid:48) r h cos œà + p 2 Œ∫rh cos œà + Œ≥ Œ∫rh 2 sin œà + Œ∑ Œ∫rh 2 cos œà , ( 6 ) and two first - order equations 198 Œ≥ (cid:48) = h (cid:34) 1 2 Œ∫ (cid:18) œà (cid:48) h ‚àí c 0 (cid:19) 2 ‚àí Œ∫ sin 2 œà 2 r 2 + œÉ + pr sin œà (cid:35) , ( 7 ) 10 / 14 and 199 Œ∑ (cid:48) = 0 , ( 8 ) as well as the two geometric relations in Eq . ( 1 ) . 200 In addition , the equation ‚àÇL / ‚àÇh = 0 does not give an equation of h , but leads to a 201 conserved quantity [ 30 , 31 ] 202 H ‚â° ‚àÇL ‚àÇh = Œ∫ 2 r (cid:34)(cid:18) œà (cid:48) h (cid:19) 2 ‚àí (cid:18) sin œà r ‚àí c 0 (cid:19) 2 (cid:35) ‚àí p 2 r 2 sin œà ‚àí œÉr + Œ≥ cos œà ‚àí Œ∑ sin œà = 0 . ( 9 ) There is a freedom to choose the scale function h . Here we choose h (cid:48) = 0 such that h is a 203 constant to be determined . It is essentially the total arclength of the membrane profile . 204 Derivation of the boundary conditions 205 By letting the boundary terms in Eq . ( 5 ) equal to zero , we obtain the BCs . In particular , 206 in the boundary term about Œ¥r , we let Œ¥r (cid:12)(cid:12) u = 1 u = 0 = 0 , which implies to fix the radius 207 r ( 0 ) = 0 , r ( 1 ) = R pore . ( 10 ) In the boundary term about Œ¥z , we obtain 208 ‚àÇL ‚àÇz (cid:48) ( u = 0 ) = Œ∑ ( 0 ) = 0 , z ( 0 ) = 0 . ( 11 ) As for the boundary term about Œ¥œà , at the membrane tip , we have 209 œà ( 0 ) = 0 . ( 12 ) At the pore edge , we have two choices . If we let Œ¥œà ( 1 ) = 0 , it is equivalent to the 210 fixed - hinge BC 211 œà ( 1 ) = 0 . ( 13 ) If we let ‚àÇL / ‚àÇœà (cid:48) = 0 , it is equivalent to the free - hinge BC 212 ‚àÇL ‚àÇœà (cid:48) = Œ∫ (cid:18) œà (cid:48) h + sin œà r ‚àí c 0 (cid:19) = 0 . ( 14 ) The conserved quantity H = 0 at the membrane tip u = 0 gives rise to a BC 213 Œ≥ ( 0 ) = 0 . ( 15 ) Numerical methods to calculate the D pore vs . R pore curve 214 So far we have obtained a total number of 5 equations , which include Eqs . ( 1 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 8 ) , 215 ( 8 ) . Since only Eq . ( 6 ) is first order , they are equivalent to a total number of 6 first 216 order ordinary differential equations . In addition , Eqs . ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) or ( 14 ) 217 constitute a total number of 7 BCs . Overall , the 6 equations plus 1 unknown parameter 218 h , and the 7 BCs constitute a well - defined boundary value problem . 219 We solve the problem with the matlab solver bvp5c , which requires the equations and 220 the BCs as its input . Furthermore , the solver requires an initial guess of the solutions . 221 In order to obtain the D pore vs . R pore curve , We always start with a small R pore and use 222 the flat shape as our initial guess . In this case , the membrane is almost flat , and it is 223 easy for the solver to find the solution . We then gradually increase the pore radius R pore 224 to R pore + ‚àÜ R and use the solution for R pore as the initial guess to solve the equation 225 11 / 14 for R pore + ‚àÜ R . This iteration step allows us to extend the solution to the critical pore 226 radius since beyond which no solutions are found anymore . We then use the solution at 227 the critical pore radius as the starting point and iterate over the membrane depth D pore 228 to obtain the other branch of the solution . During this iteration , we add the boundary 229 condition z ( 0 ) = D pore and set the pore radius R pore as an unknown parameter to be 230 solved by the solver . 231 Acknowledgments 232 We acknowledge financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China 233 under Grants No . 12004317 , Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of 234 China under Grant No . 20720200072 , and 111 project No .
