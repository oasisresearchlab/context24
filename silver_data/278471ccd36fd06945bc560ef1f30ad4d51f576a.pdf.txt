However , little is known about social mixing patterns in these populations . Methods We conducted a cross - sectional social contact survey among internally displaced people ( IDP ) living in Digaale , a permanent IDP camp in Somaliland . We included questions on household demographics , shelter quality , crowding , travel frequency , health status , and recent diagnosis of pneumonia , and assessed anthropometric status in children . We calculated age - standardised social contact matrices to assess population mixing , and conducted regression analysis on risk factors for recent self - reported pneumonia . Results We found crowded households with high proportions of recent self - reported pneumonia ( 46 % in children ) . 20 % of children younger than five are stunted , and crude death rates are high in all age groups . ARI risk factors are common , but we did not find any significant associations with self - reported pneumonia . Participants reported around 10 direct contacts per day . Social contact patterns are assortative by age , and physical contact rates are very high ( 78 % ) . Conclusions .

Unsurprisingly , patterns of transmission for respiratory pathogens correlate strongly with social contact patterns among different groups of people . 2 , 3 In addition , other factors such as malnutrition 4 modulate host responses to infection thereby affecting both individual susceptibility to infection and the rate of pathogen shedding , i . e . infectiousness to others . Accordingly , epidemiological transmission models commonly stratify populations into groups , usually by age , and assume different contact rates among these groups . To accurately parametrize such models , several surveys have collected empirical contact data by asking participants to report the frequency with which they come into direct contact with people from their and other groups . 5 – 9 The majority of these studies have been conducted in high - income countries , with limited information from lower - and middle - income countries . 10 To our knowledge , no contact surveys have captured the experience of populations living in refugee or internally - displaced persons’ ( IDP ) camps , despite these settings experiencing a high burden of endemic and epidemic - prone infections , including respiratory diseases . 11 , 12 Nearly 80 million people were forcibly displaced due to insecurity and war in 2019 . 13 Many of these people live in overcrowded camps where residents are often unemployed or unable to work , not all children may have access to school , hygiene may be curtailed by inadequate water and sanitation services , and people may be required to gather in large groups during relief distributions or at queues at water points , etc . These factors likely affect social contact patterns , in turn impacting the spread of infections . Food insecurity and resultant acute malnutrition are .

In the context of a project to study the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate ( PCV ) vaccination among IDPs , we aimed to parameterise a model of Streptococcus pneumoniae transmission . 15 We therefore conducted a contact and risk factor survey in an IDP camp in Somaliland in 2019 to quantify factors commonly associated with transmission of respiratory infections . Methods Study population We conducted a cross - sectional survey on social contacts and prevalence of risk factors in the Digaale IDP camp near Hargeisa , the capital of Somaliland . The camp was established in 2014 , in response to a large influx of displaced people in Somaliland following an acute food insecurity crisis . It is situated 3km from Hargeisa airport and 4km from the city borders , has an area of 15 hectares and is surrounded mainly by desert and shrubland . Digaale has a small primary healthcare centre , that operates under the Somaliland Ministry of Health Development , and a primary school . There are 894 shelters in Digaale that are all constructed from corrugated sheets . Each household has access to a private latrine and private water tank . Several photos of Digaale IDP camp are provided in section A of the supplementary material . .

Purposes and procedures of the study were presented to and discussed with the elders and other representatives from the community in advance . Data collection was conducted by the Somaliland Ministry of Health Development in collaboration with Save the Children International , who provide health and nutrition services in the camp . A team of 12 enumerators were trained for a week and undertook data collection between October - November 2019 . Data collection was done from 8AM until 4PM on all days of the week except Friday . A community leader notified the population living in the block that would be visited on specific days , and answered any questions regarding the presence of enumerators . Adults provided informed written consent , including on behalf of their children under the age of 18 , and acted as proxies for young children who were unable to answer for themselves . Children aged > 12 and < 18 years were asked for assent . As there was no sampling frame , we employed quota sampling to reach the desired sample size in each age group . We visited all shelters in Digaale and conducted a household survey in consenting households . A household was defined as individuals who live together and share a common source of food . The survey followed the Standardised Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions ( SMART ) guidance to collect the age and gender of those currently living in the household , and retrospectively assessed who had been born or died , and who migrated in or out of the household in the preceding six months . 16 A localized event calendar was used to aid in the recollection of timing of events . In addition , the survey included questions to ascertain the presence of household level risk factors : total number of rooms , leakage or draft in the shelter , cooking fuel used , ventilation used in the cooking area , water source , and substance .

At completion of the survey , household members were assigned sampling weights based on their age . These weights were then used to sample one household member , who was invited to take part in the second stage of the survey . We asked those consenting to remember all people they would contact on the following day , and agreed a time for a return visit on the day thereafter . During the return visit , we conducted a second survey that assessed individual travel patterns and direct social and physical contacts . The survey was developed as an extension of contact surveys conducted in non - IDP populations . 5 , 6 Participants were asked to first list ( nick ) names or initials of all their contactees . A contactee was defined as any individual who was met in person during the 24 hours before waking up on the day being surveyed , and with whom the participant had at least a short conversation ( direct contact ) . For each contactee , participants were asked to list several characteristics : estimated age ( in years ) and gender , relationship to the contactee , setting where the contact occurred , type of contact ( physical touch or nonphysical ) , duration of the contact , and typical frequency with which participant and contactee have contact . Physical touch was defined as any form of skin - to - skin contact . Participants were also asked to estimate the total number of indirect in - person contacts they made that did not fit the criteria for a direct contact , and to list any health conditions diagnosed by a health professional . If pneumonia was listed as a health condition , we asked whether diagnosis occurred within the six months preceding the survey . For all participants aged 6 - 59 months , we measured height ( or length if less than 85cm ) , weight , middle - upper arm circumference ( MUAC ) and presence of bilateral oedema on the dorsum of both feet as described in the SMART guidance . Anthropometric instruments and observations were standardised prior to data collection on a convenience sample of children seen at the health facility . .

To assess selection bias for shelters where no person was present on all visits , we asked neighbours of a random sample of 96 of these shelters whether their neighbouring shelter was still inhabited . Participants who were not available on the return visit were also revisited up to a total of five times . If participants were no longer available , or withdrew consent , they were replaced with another individual of the same household within the same age group , where possible . All data were collected on electronic tablets using Open Data Kit software 17 . Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Somaliland Ministry of Health Development , Directorate of Planning , Policy , and Strategic Information , and by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine . Data analysis As the sample for the participants included in the second phase of our survey was not self - weighting , and we deliberately oversampled individuals in the youngest and oldest age groups , we used post stratification weights to calculate population representative estimates of individual - level data . 18 These weights are the inverse of a participant’s probability of selection in the sample , which was the product of the inverse of their household size and the estimated proportion of the population included in the sample in their respective age - and gender stratum . We further applied an additional weight to correct for imbalances in the distribution of days of the week within the final survey sample when estimating contact rates . We censored sample weights below or above the 5th and 95th percentile of all sample weights to those percentiles . As we sampled a large proportion of households ( 65 % ) and individuals ( 17 % ) living in Digaale , we used finite population corrections ( FPC ) to calculate standard errors . The total population size of Digaale used in the FPC , for all ages and within each age group , was estimated by .

This factor was calculated as the survey - estimated proportion of inhabited shelters included in the survey , the latter being the upper bound of the survey - estimated proportion of non - abandoned shelters . More detailed information is provided in Supplemental Section B . The survey package in R was used to perform the weighting and to apply the FPC when estimating weighted means , proportions , and quantiles where applicable . 19 To estimate birth , death , and migration rates , we calculated person - time for each reported household member , including those who had died or migrated out , by assigning six months ( the full recall period ) to any individual who lived continuously within the household over the period . As we did not record exact dates when deaths , births and migration events occurred , an individual’s person - time was reduced by 50 % for each of these events experienced . We estimated weighted rates by fitting a Poisson generalized linear model using the natural logarithm of person - time as an offset . Nutritional data were analysed by calculating age - and sex - standardised z - scores for a range of anthropometric indices based on the World Health Organization Growth Reference standards 20 , which were subsequently categorized to assess malnutrition status . The zscorer package in R was used for the anthropometric analyses . 21 We constructed contact matrices to visualise age - stratified daily contact rates and per capita contact rates , which were adjusted for reciprocity in the total number of contacts using the method by Wallinga et al . 22 Uncertainty in the contact matrix was quantified by taking 10 , 000 bootstrap samples of all participants in the survey . The relationship between different risk - factors and the cumulative incidence of self - reported pneumonia was assessed using unweighted logistic regression , adjusted for age and sex as a - .

Of these , 405 were empty on all occasions visited . We randomly sampled 96 of these empty shelters and asked neighbours whether the shelter was occupied . Using this sample , we estimate that 50 % ( 95 % CI 39 - 60 ) of the shelters had been uninhabited for a long time , while 38 % ( 28 - 49 ) of the shelters were occupied and 12 % ( 6 - 19 ) were a shop or combined with another shelter already included in the survey . Using the upper bound of these estimates , we conservatively assume that there are a total of 872 unique shelters in Digaale , of which 715 are inhabited . Twenty - five households declined consent . We thus enrolled and collected demographic information from 2 , 049 individuals who were living in 464 households at the time of the survey ( 65 % of inhabited unique shelters ) , with additional information collected about 166 individuals who migrated out of these households and 34 individuals who had died in the six months preceding the survey . In the contact survey we enrolled 509 participants from 426 households , who provided information about 4 , 857 contactees . Of all participants included in the contact .

Despite their inclusion and consent in the first household visit , individuals from 38 households were lost to follow up for participation in the contact survey , with a further three individuals declining consent . Demographic characteristics The median age among household study participants was 15 years ; 25 % were younger than 7 years old and 75 % were younger than 34 years old ( Figure 1 ) . There were notably fewer adult men than women . The male to female gender ratio among enrolled household members of all ages was 1 : 1 . 2 , and 1 : 1 . 5 in adults . The respective gender ratio was 1 : 1 . 9 among the participants enrolled in the contact study and 1 : 1 . 9 among their reported contacts . The crude birth and death rates were estimated as 32 and 33 per 1 , 000 per year , respectively , in the six months preceding the survey . The crude under 5 years death rate was estimated at 57 per 1 , 000 per year . Crude in - and out - migration rates were high at 139 and 161 per 1 , 000 per year in the same period ( Table 1 ) . The majority of households ( 79 % ) settled in Digaale more than 3 years prior to the survey , while 6 % settled in the year prior to the survey . The median household size was 4 individuals , ranging from 1 ( 83 households ) to 12 ( 3 households ) ( Figure 1A ) . Living conditions The majority of households had only a single room ( 93 % ) , with 6 % having two rooms and 2 % three or four rooms . Most households reported having draughts ( 73 % ) and leakage ( 74 % ) in their shelter . Both firewood ( 84 % ) and charcoal ( 60 % ) were commonly reported as cooking fuels . The majority of households usually cook outside ( 66 % ) or in a ventilated area inside ( 23 % ) , with a minority ( 10 % ) of households reporting to cook in an unventilated area . Khat .

Travel patterns We estimate that just under half of the population never travels outside the Digaale camp , while one fifth does so at least once per week . Those who do travel predominantly go to nearby locations , including the city of Hargeisa . Less than 10 % reported travelling further than 10km from the camp and less than 3 % more than once a week ( Table 2 ) . Anthropometric status We estimate that 14 % of all children under 5 years old in the population were underweight for their age , and 4 % of all children severely underweight . Prevalence of global acute malnutrition ( wasting , GAM ) was 9 % when expressed using weight - for - height Z score , with 2 % severely malnourished . In contrast , GAM was 3 % when assessed by MUAC , with no children severely malnourished and none diagnosed with oedema . 20 % of children were stunted . Social contact patterns The average number of direct daily contacts was relatively consistent by age ( Table 3 ) , and was highest for those aged 2 - 5 years ( 10 . 7 ) and lowest for those aged 50 + years ( 8 . 8 ) . A large proportion ( > 77 % ) of these contacts are physical . The proportion of physical contacts is relatively consistent across contact frequency , duration , relationship , and setting ( Figure 2 ) . Nearly all direct contacts were made with previously known individuals ( 99 % of all contacts ) , mostly household members ( 34 % of all contacts ) , relatives not in the household ( 25 % ) , and friends ( 30 % ) . Most contacts are met daily or almost daily ( 88 % ) , and most ( 42 % ) reported contacts lasted longer than four hours . All age groups report a high number of indirect casual contacts in addition to their direct contacts , with little variability across age - groups . .

The average number of school or work contacts is higher when restricted to participants who report at least one school or work contact , but remains lower compared to contacts made at home or in another house in all age groups ( Supplemental table C1 ) . The contact matrices in Figure 2 show who contacts whom . We observe the highest average daily number of contacts within the same age group to be among children . The higher overall contact rates made by children reflect the relatively high proportion of the population that are children , while the per capita contact rates give an estimate of assortativity adjusted for population size . Overall , contacts were mostly age - assortative , especially in children , with more intergenerational contacts in adults . Out of 4 , 857 contacts , only 91 were reported to occur outside of Digaale , all of which occurred in Hargeisa . 95 % uncertainty estimates around the contact rates are shown in Supplemental Figure C1 . Supplemental figure C2 shows contact patterns by setting . They are relatively age - assortative outside the household , while more age - disassortative within the household . Contacts were also gender - assortative ( Supplemental figure C3 ) . Children had higher contact rates with adult women than adult men , and age - assortative mixing was higher in men than in women . Self - reported pneumonia illness There was a strong decreasing trend by age for self - reported cumulative incidence of pneumonia diagnosis ( Table 1 ) . Around 54 % of children under 5 were reported to have ever been diagnosed with at least one episode of pneumonia , while 46 % of children under 2 were reported to have been diagnosed with pneumonia within the last six months . .

There was some evidence for an increased odds of self - reported pneumonia diagnosis in the six months preceding the survey for those living in households where snuff was consumed ( OR 2 . 6 ; 95 % CI 1 . 1 - 6 . 0 ) . Discussion To our best knowledge this is the first study to collect data on social contacts in any IDP camp , and to describe risk factors relevant for the spread of infectious respiratory diseases in a Somaliland IDP camp . We found that the majority of households have been living in Digaale for over three years , while estimated crude migration rates are relatively high . There is a high female to male ratio in adults living in Digaale . We estimated a low mean age and corresponding high crude death rates , especially in those younger than five years . The estimated crude death rates ( per 10 , 000 per day in the six months preceding the survey ) was 0 . 9 for all ages and 1 . 5 for children younger than 5 years , and are considerably higher than those reported for Somalia including Somaliland between 2013 - 2018 ( 0 . 43 and 0 . 66 ) . 25 Our findings underscore the consistently higher mortality observed among IDPs , compared to other population groups . 26 Although we do not know the aetiology of these deaths , a high proportion of participants reported a historical pneumonia diagnosis , especially in younger children . Several known risk factors for respiratory infections in children are prevalent . 27 , 28 First , approximately 14 % of children in Digaale were underweight . Although no children were found to .

Nearly a fifth of children had stunted growth , reflecting long - term undernutrition , which may indicate periods of inadequate access to food for their families . These data are similar to estimates in IDP populations in Somalia . 29 Second , individuals live in relatively poor - quality shelters , while local minimum temperatures can drop to 5 °C . Firewood and charcoal are the only cooking fuels used in Digaale , and both can raise levels of indoor air pollution . However , only a small proportion of households cooks in an unventilated area indoors , which mitigates this risk . At least one household member smokes in one third of all households , which could further affect levels of indoor air pollution . Third , levels of crowding within Digaale are substantial . While the average household size of four people is below the national average 30 , most households share only a single small room . Increased human contact facilitates the transmission of pathogens causing respiratory diseases . On average , individuals have around 10 direct contacts each day , which is consistent between age groups , and the majority of these contacts involve physical touch . The average number of reported direct contacts was lower in this setting when compared to contact surveys conducted in Kenya 7 or a South African township 9 , though this likely reflect a difference in survey design , as we excluded casual contacts from our contact definition . In Digaale , individuals reported on average a further 13 indirect contacts per day , though these are less likely to result in respiratory transmission . The average proportion of direct contacts that were physical was higher in Digaale ( 78 % ) compared to a crowded township in South Africa ( 27 % ) 9 , and a peri - urban township in Zimbabwe ( 57 % ) 8 , but similar to a rural setting in Uganda ( 73 % ) . 6 Compared to these settings , we find that contacts in Digaale are more likely to occur at the home , with very few made at school or work . .

First , our estimates may be affected by selection bias , as the proportion of male participants of working age included in the survey was smaller than the proportion of men of this age in the population . We could only conduct data collection during daylight hours , and may therefore have missed individuals who work outside Digaale , as many leave the camp very early in the morning and only return late at night . Of the 35 % of shelters not included in the survey , many were ( according to neighbours ) single occupancy dwellings whose residents were absent during working hours . Second , caregivers completed the survey on behalf of young children , which may have resulted in underreporting of non - household contacts of those children , and explain why e . g . reported direct contacts at school are very low . Third , we designed the survey to collect retrospective data on social contacts , which could result in a lower reported number of contacts due to recall bias 10 . We asked participants to remember their contacts one day in advance , and used structured interviews with specific prompts in an attempt to minimize any recall issues . We assessed contact rates for potential underreporting by comparing the reported intra - household contact rates with the expected intra - household contact rates based on household demographics ( Supplemental Figure C4 ) . While the relative reported contact patterns were very similar to the expected contact patterns , their absolute values were lower , with the dominant eigenvalue of the matrix 35 % lower than that of the expected matrix . This may reflect underreporting of household contacts , but could also reflect household members having less than one contact per day , on average . Finally , while our regression analysis did not find any significant association between any of the known risk factors considered and self - reported estimates of pneumonia , our study was not designed nor powered to do so . Self - reported pneumonia may be an unreliable outcome measure , and it was unclear what case definitions were used when making the diagnoses . .

Crude death rates in the camp exceeded the already high rates in the host population Somalia and Somaliland . Compared to other settings , a large degree of contacts are of a physical nature , and the vast majority of contacts are made within homes . We find social mixing to be assortative by both age and sex , but there is low variability in total number of contacts by age . Malnutrition is prevalent , and indoor air pollution is likely high , while individuals live in crowded shelters of poor quality . This study illustrates that such IDP settings potentially present a perfect storm of risk factors for lower respiratory tract infections and their transmission , often combined with inadequate access to curative or preventive health care . Innovative approaches to address such risks are urgently needed . .
