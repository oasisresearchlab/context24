In these regions where the surface of the cell comes closest to the substrate , the plasma membrane is specialized at its cytoplasmic face for anchoring stress fibers , the large bundles of microfilaments that are prominent in many cultured cells . In this review we discuss the composition and organization of focal adhesions . Many of their characteristics indicate that they are structurally and func­ tionally equivalent to the adhesions made by many cells to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) in vivo . We also consider the regulatory proteins that have been identified in focal adhesions since these regions are interesting not only as models for studying the links between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton , but also as sites of transmembrane communication between the extracellular environment and the cytoplasm . Many features of focal adhesions , some of which are not considered here , have been reviewed previously ( Burridge 1986 ; Woods & Couchman 1988 ) . MORPHOLOGY AND OBSERVATION OF FOCAL ADHESIONS Focal adhesions were first identified in electron microscope studies of cultured fibroblasts ( Abercrombie et al 1971 ) . It was noted that some regions of the " ventral " cell surf ace were much closer to the substrate than others . These regions exhibited an increased electron density , and microfilaments were associated with local dense " plaques " on the cyto­ plasmic face of the membrane . While electron microscopy continues to be used to study focal adhesions , particularly in conjunction with im­ munological markers for specific components , its potential to reveal many of the ultrastructural details has been frustrated by the high electron density of these regions , which makes difficult ( or impossible ) the visu­ alization of the ends of individual actin filaments and of their interactions with the cell membrane . Interference reflection microscopy ( IRM ) is a light microscope technique introduced into biological study by Curtis ( 1964 ) in order to examine the relationship of the ventral surf ace of cells to the substrate . Izzard & Lochner ( 1976 ) used IRM to classify the ventral surface of cultured cells into three types of regions according to the degree of proximity of the plasma membrane to the substrate . The closest regions , which appeared black by IRM , had a separation of 10- - 15 nm from the substrate and were referred to as " focal contacts . " Gray images , corresponding to a separation of about 30 nm , were called " close contacts . " Finally , some regions appeared faint gray or white , which indicated a separation of 100 nm or more from the substrate . Cells can adhere to the substrate by both focal and close contacts . Whereas close contacts often extend over broad areas , A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y . FOCAL ADHESIONS 489 focal contacts are confined , typically 2 - 10 Jlm long and 0 . 25--0 . 5 Jlm wide . The theoretical basis of IRM and some of its potential pitfalls have been discussed elsewhere ( Curtis 1964 ; Izzard & Lochner 1976 , 1980 ; Bereiter­ Hahn et a11979 ; Gingell 1981 ) . Using both electron microscopy and IRM on the same cells confirmed that the adhesion plaques seen by electron microscopy are the same as focal contacts revealed by IRM ( Abercrombie & Dunn 1975 ; Heath & Dunn 1978 ) . Henceforth we use the hybrid term " focal adhesion " for these structures because it carries the functional connotation of adhesion as well as indicating that they are associated with discrete regions of the plasma membrane . The use of IRM in combination with immunofluorescence microscopy was valuable in confirming the presence of specific proteins such as vinculin in focal adhesions ( Geiger 1979 ) . Subsequently , immuno­ fluorescence microscopy with antibodies against vinculin has become a routine method for visualizing these adhesive specializations . This is particularly useful in studying newly formed focal adhesions , which are difficult to detect by IRM ( Geiger et a1 1984a , b ; Bershadsky et al 1985 ) . However , caution is required because vinculin is also detected in other cellular locations ( see below ) and can be mobilized selectively from focal adhesions in response to certain agents ( Herman & Pledger 198 5 ) . Visu­ alization of focal adhesions by both IRM and immunofluorescence with antibodies against talin is illustrated in Figure 1 . An immunofluorescence " antibody - exclusion " technique has also been used to visualize focal adhesions ( Neyfakh et aI1983 ) . When cells are grown in serum , antibodies Figure 1 The organization of stress fibers and focal adhesions in two chicken embryo fibroblasts .

If the cells are detergent extracted prior to staining , the vitronectin beneath the adhesions is also stained . Several techniques have been developed for isolating focal adhesions based on the observation that these regions are the most adherent parts of cultured cells . In most of these methods , a stream of buffer has been used to detach the bulk of the cell while leaving behind the focal adhesions attached to the dish or coverslip ( Badley et a11978 ; Cathcart & Culp 1979 ; Avnur & Geiger 1981a ; Avnur et al 1983 ; Neyfakh & Svitkina 1983 ; Ball et a11986 ; Nicol & Nermut 1987 ) . These preparations have been useful in studying the binding of purified proteins to focal adhesions ( Avnur et al 1983 ; Ball et al 1986 ) , but for biochemical analysis they yield only very small amounts of material . In general , focal adhesion proteins that have been characterized in detail have been isolated from smooth muscle such as chicken gizzard ( e . g . Geiger 1979 ; Feramisco & Burridge 1980 ; Burridge & Connelll983a ; Molony et aI1987b ) . FORMATION OF FOCAL ADHESIONS Many cells , including fibroblasts , epithelial cells , endothelial cells , and platelets , form focal adhesions when plated onto appropriate substrates . When focal adhesions were first discovered and were noted to be associated with stress fibers , they were considered important in cell migration ( Aber­ crombie et aI1971 ) . They are most prominent , however , in stationary cells and absent from some highly migratory cells ( Couchman & Rees 1979 ; Kolega et al 1982 ) . An inverse correlation was similarly found between stress fibers and movement ( Herman et al 1981 ; Couchman et al 1982 ) . While studying the migration of cells from a tissue explant , it was noted that initially the cells were highly motile ; they revealed close contacts rather than focal adhesions and lacked stress fibers . With time , the cells developed focal adhesions and stress fibers . This change in morphology correlated with a decrease in migration ( Couchman & Rees 1979 ; Couchman et al 1982 ) . Although prominent in relatively stationary cells , focal adhesions usually form within or just behind the ruffling leading edge of motile cells ( Izzard & Lochner 1980 ) . Persistent ruffling has been noted above focal adhesions , as if the adhesion is itself a stimulus for this activity ( Geiger et al 1984b ; Small & Rinnerthaler 1985 ) . There is often a correlation between ruffling and the later formation of a focal adhesion at the same site ( Rinnerthaler et al 1988 ) . The formation of focal adhesions is preceded by a structural precursor A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

FOCAL ADHESIONS 491 consisting of a microspike or bundle of actin filaments oriented radially within the leading edge of a cell ( Izzard & Lochner 1980 ; DePasquale & Izzard 1987 ; Izzard 1988 ; Rinnerthaler et al 1988 ) . Observation of these precursors by light microscopy has brought new insight into the events leading to focal adhesion formation . The precursors can be divided into two portions : a proximal part that becomes stationary and forms the plaque on the cytoplasmic face of the focal adhesion membrane , and a distal part , which continues to advance with the leading edge ( DePasquale & Izzard 1987 ) . Talin , but not vinculin , has been detected at the leading edge and is concentrated at the tips of the distal portion of the precursors ( Izzard 1988 ) where micro filaments terminate in an electron dense patch of material associated with the plasma membrane ( Small 1981 ) . As the precursor separates physically into two parts , talin remains with the leading edge and a second population oftalin accumulates in the developing focal adhesion with approximately the same time course as vinculin accumu­ lation at this site ( Izzard 1988 ) . After their initial formation , some focal adhesions disassemble while others enlarge and nucleate associated stress fibers . The maturation of focal adhesions is disrupted in some transformed cells ; such cells contain at their margins many small adhesion sites that fail to enlarge and acquire attached stress fibers ( Bershadsky et al 1985 ) . While studying the matu­ ration offocal adhesions , it was noted that the more stable focal adhesions were often associated with the ends of microtubules ( Geiger et al 1984b ; Small & Rinnerthaler 1985 ; Rinnerthaler et al 1988 ) . In addition , dis­ ruption of micro tubules by treatment with nocodazole increased the num­ ber of small ( immature ) focal adhesions at the periphery ( Small & Rin­ nerthaler 1985 ) . These results suggest that association with micro tubules may increase focal adhesion stability and promote nucleation of stress fibers ( Geiger et al 1984b ; Small & Rinnerthaler 1985 ; Rinnerthaler et al 1988 ) . The recent finding that some intermediate filaments also terminate at focal adhesions ( Green & Goldman 1986 ; Bershadsky et al 1987 ) has led to a similar suggestion : The association of intermediate filaments with focal adhesions may stabilize these structures ( Bershadsky et al 1987 ) . Focal adhesions may also be stabilized at their extracellular face by the deposition of additional components . For example , it was found that a heparan sulfate proteoglycan was absent from many focal adhesions 6 hours after plating cells , but was prominent in these structures after 24 hours in culture ( Singer et al 1987a ) . DYNAMICS OF FOCAL ADHESION COMPONENTS The dynamics of focal adhesion components has been studied by fluo­ rescence recovery after photobleaching ( Geiger et a11982 , 1984a ; Kreis et A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y . 492 BURRID GE ET AL aI1982 ) . In the plane of the membrane of a focal adhesion , there is little resistance to the diffusion of lipid components , but the lateral diffusion of membrane proteins is retarded ( Geiger et al 1982 ) . The same approach has been used to study the dynamics of proteins such as vinculin , (X­ actinin , and actin after the microin jection oftluorescent derivatives of these proteins into live cells and their incorporation into the cytoskeleton ( Kreis et a11982 ; Geiger et aI1984a ) . Outside the regions of focal adhesions , 60- 80 % of the injected protein is free to diffuse , but within focal adhesion regions , the mobility of these proteins is greatly reduced . Within focal adhesions , a very slow recovery of fluorescence was observed after spot photo bleaching . The half time of recovery ( 2 - -4 min ) suggests slow exchange of proteins between the focal adhesion and the surround­ ing cytoplasmic pool of proteins ( Geiger et aI1984a ) . A similar result was obtained by Stickel & Wang ( 1987 ) . However , these investigators found that the abnormal adhesions ( podosomes ) formed in Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV) - transformed cells ( discussed below ) showed a very rapid exchange of components , with a half time of recovery on the order of a few seconds . Although protein exchange occurs within focal adhesions , these struc­ tures are usually stable for long periods once they have matured from initially small adhesion sites . Nevertheless , net movement of entire focal adhesions has been described . Without the loss of their associated stress fibers , two focal adhesions were observed to translocate about 4 /lm relative to each other over a period of about 90 min ( Sanger et al 1987 ) . How this movement occurred has not been determined , but it indicates that these adhesions may be more dynamic than previously considered . Focal adhesions are clearly important for anchoring stress fibers to the plasma membrane , but they probably also regulate the assembly and disassembly of the attached actin filaments . In support of actin poly­ merization being nucleated at these sites , fluorescently derivatized actin microinjected into cells concentrates at newly formed focal adhesions ( Kreis et al 1982 ; Wang 1984 ) . Some proteins found in focal adhesions may regulate the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments . This process may be quite complex , enabling tension to be transmitted to the membrane while simultaneously allowing these actin filaments to elongate or shorten . Studying the assembly of stress fibers in cells microinjected with tluorescent actin , Wang observed that the stress fibers appeared to elongate from the focal adhesions , either in the front or rear of the cell ( Wang 1984 ) . In general , the focal adhesions remained stationary relative to the substrate as the cells moved forward although the orientation of stress fibers sometimes changed . Disassembly of stress fibers was observed from both ends ( Wang 1984 ) . A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

FOCAL ADHESIONS 493 OCCURRENCE OF FOCAL ADHESIONS IN VIVO Focal adhesions are often considered to be artifacts of tissue culture because they are prominent in many cultured cells but less obvious in most cells within whole organisms . The focal adhesions of cultured cells are unusual primarily because of their planar configuration and the size of the associated stress fibers . The planar configuration is clearly imposed by the growth of cultured cells on fiat , rigid substrates . The size and prominence of stress fibers in cultured cells has been discussed previously ( Burridge 1981 , 1986 ; Byers et a11984 ) and appears to be due in part to the strong adhesions made with the rigid substrate ( the culture dish or coverslip ) and to the consequent isometric tension generated by the associated micro­ filaments . In contrast , fibroblasts grown in collagen gels lack discernible stress fibers and focal adhesions ( Tomasek et aI1982 ) . There are , however , several cell types in the body that develop adhesions structurally similar , if not identical , to the focal adhesions seen in tissue culture . One of the best examples is the dense plaque of smooth muscle cells . Like the focal adhesion , the plaque is a junction between the ECM on the outside of the cell and the contractile microfilament system on the inside . Although in cross sections they appear as discrete plaques applied to the membrane , in longitudinal sections these structures may extend the length of the muscle cell ( Small 1985 ) . Dense plaques contain essentially the same repertoire of proteins as focal adhesions , including vinculin ( Geiger et a11980 , 1981 ) , talin ( Geiger et a11985 , Drenckhahn et aI1988 ) , and integrin ( S . C . Mueller , W . - T . Chen , personal communication ) . The presence of IX - actinin has also been reported in the dense plaques of smooth muscle cells ( Schollmeyer et aI1976 ) , where it was noted to be farther from the plasma membrane than vinculin ( Geiger et al 1981 ) . A more recent study found little or no a - actinin in the dense plaques ( Small 1985 ) . The reason for this apparent discrepancy needs to be explored . The myotendinous junction of skeletal muscle also shares structural and functional characteristics with focal adhesions ; it is a specialized region of the plasma membrane that anchors actin filaments and transmits their tension across the membrane to the ECM . In this case , the ECM forms the tendon . It has been calculated that during maximum isometric tension , the stress placed on the myotendinous junction is '" 2 X 10 4 N ( New­ tons ) / m 2 , and that this correlates closely with the shear stress generated at the sites of fibroblast adhesion ( '" 1 0 4 N 1m 2 ) ( Tidball et al 1986 ) . Again , several prominent focal adhesion proteins have been identified in myo­ tendinous junctions , including vinculin ( Shear & Bloch 1985 ) , talin ( Tidball et al 1986 ) , and integrin ( Boszycko et al 1988 ) . The presence of a - actinin in myotendinous junctions and in smooth muscle dense plaques ( Tidball 1987 ) has been questioned . A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y . 494 BURRIDGE ET AL Several focal adhesion proteins have been localized to another region in skeletal muscle fibers , the postsynaptic region of neuromuscular junctions ( Bloch & Hall 1983 ; Sealock et aI1986 ) . This is not a region where tension is expected to be transmitted across the membrane , which suggests that these proteins have a different function in neuromuscular junctions , per­ haps organizing acetylcholine receptor clusters . Recent work on muscles from Xenopus iaevis , however , has indicated that not all neuromuscular junctions contain taIin ( M . W . Rochlin et aI , manuscript submitted ) . The reasons for this variability are not clear . Superficially , a focal adhesion resembles the zonula adherens junction between adjacent epithelial cells . Geiger and coworkers showed that these cell - cell junctions have a somewhat different composition than focal adhesions and classified adherens junctions into two types on the basis of their constituent proteins ( Geiger et al 1985 ) : cell - cell junctions that lack talin but contain a 135 - kDa cell adhesion molecule ( Yolk & Geiger 1984 ) and cell - ECM junctions that lack this cell adhesion molecule but contain talin . Both types of junction contain vinculin , which indicates that the presence of this protein at the membrane does not depend on talin ( see below ) . Epithelial cells have been shown to contain low levels of talin , confined to the basal surface where these cells adhere to the underlying basement membrane ( Drenckhahn et aI1988 ) . Many proteins found in fibroblast focal adhesions are present in large amounts in blood platelets ( Rosenberg et al 1981 ; Collier & Wang 1982 ; Koteliansky et al 1984 ; O ' Halloran et al 1985 ; Rosenfeld et al 1985 ) . Platelets form focal adhesions when plated on appropriate substrates ( Zobel & Woods 1983 ; Alexandrova & Vasiliev 1984 ) , and adhesion to the ECM is essential to their function in vivo . For example , platelet adhesion to the subendothelial ECM , exposed by blood vessel injury , triggers platelet activation . In turn , this stimulates increased adhesiveness to other ECM proteins and promotes platelet aggregation . Platelet adhesion is a complex subject beyond the scope of this review ; however , many of the details of this system are relevant to the formation and organization offocal adhesions in fibroblasts and other cells . COMPOSITION OF FOCAL ADHESIONS Extracellular Matrix Components The composition of the substrate is critical in determining the adhesive behavior of cells . Fibroblasts adhere well to surfaces coated with various ECM proteins , such as fibronectin ( FN ) or vitronectin ( VN ) ; they sub­ sequently spread on these substrates and develop focal adhesions . In con­ trast , normal fibroblasts adhere poorly and fail to develop focal adhesions A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

Some spreading may occur with time , but this depends on the synthesis and secretion of FN , which adsorbs onto the adjacent substrate ( Grinnell & Feld 1979 ) . Despite the enhancing effect ofFN on focal adhesion formation ( Couchman et al 1982 ; Laterra et al 1983 ; Woods et al 1986 ) , the actual relationship of FN to these adhesive structures has been controversial . FN was reported to be present in established focal adhesions by some investigators ( Grinnell 1980 ; Singer & Paradiso 1981 ) , but others found that it was notably absent ( Chen & Singer 1980 ; Birchmeier et al 1980 ; Badley et aI1980 ) . In addition , Avnur & Geiger ( l981b ) found that cells plated onto substrates coated with fluorescent FN specifically cleared it from focal adhesion regions both by centripetal movement on the surface toward the nucleus and by endocytosis . An explanation for these appar ­ ently conflicting results was suggested by Grinnell ( 1986 ) , who found that the adsorption of FN to glass was weakened significantly by the presence of other proteins . As a result of this situation , cells grown in the presence of serum were able to clear any FN from focal adhesions , whereas cells grown in the absence of serum ( or low serum ) were unable to remove FN from the substrate , and it was then detected within focal adhesions . Much emphasis has been placed upon the role played by FN in the formation of focal adhesions . By comparison , rather little attention has been given to VN even though its properties suggest that it may have a critical role in the formation of focal adhesions when cells are cultured in the presence of serum . VN ( also known as serum spreading factor ) was first identified as a serum protein that promotes adhesion of cells to glass or plastic substrates ( Holmes 1967 ; Barnes et a11983 ; Hayman et aI1983 ) . The majority of the adhesion - promoting activity in serum is accounted for by VN ( Hayman et al 1985 ) . It adsorbs tenaciously to glass so that cells plated onto coverslips in the presence of serum are essentially plated onto a VN substrate . Unlike FN , VN is not cleared from focal adhesions when cells are grown in serum although to detect it beneath these adhesions requires that the cells are permeabilized and extracted prior to fixation , presumably because it is inaccessible to antibodies beneath these adhesions ( Neyfakh et a11983 ; Baetscher et aI1986 ) . Since serum is usually present , VN is likely to be a major extracellular component of focal adhesions in most culture conditions . FN and VN are structurally quite different , but along with several other ECM proteins , they share two features that appear to be important for the formation of focal adhesions . The first is a cell - binding domain con­ taining the amino acid sequence Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) , which has been identified in many ECM proteins that interact with cells ( Ruoslahti & A nnu .

F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y . 496 BURR IDGE ET AL Pierschbacher 1987 ) . Secondly , both proteins contain a heparin - binding domain . Several studies have investigated the role of the RGD sequence in focal adhesion formation . Fibroblasts have been plated on cell - binding fragments of FN or on short synthetic peptides containing the RGD sequence , which have been linked covalently to the substrate . On these substrates some cells adhere well , spread , and develop focal adhesions ( Singer et al 1987a ) . Other cell types adhere to the cell - binding fragment of FN , but fail to develop focal adhesions ( Beyth & Culp 1984 ; Izzard et a11986 ; Woods et a11986 ) or only form small abnormal adhesions ( Streeter & Rees 1987 ) . This second group of cells could be induced to form focal adhesions and associated stress fibers if the heparin - binding domain of FN was also adsorbed to the substrate or even if it was added in solution ( Woods et al 1986 ) . The need for the heparin - binding domain of FN suggests that a heparan sulfate proteoglycan ( HSPG ) is involved in for­ mation of focal adhesions although the HSPG - binding domain alone is also insufficient to induce focal adhesions ( Laterra et al 1983 ) . HSPGs have been found on the surface of several cell types ( Kjellen et al 1981 ; R a pr ae ger & Bemfield 1983 ; Woods et a11985 ) and have also been detected in focal adhesions ( Woods et a11984 ; Singer et a11987b ) and in the material remaining on the substrate when cells are detached with calcium chela tors ( Laterra et al 1980 ; Lark & Culp 1984 ) . Further support for a role of proteoglycans in formation of focal adhesions comes from a cell line that is defective in proteoglycan synthesis and is unable to develop focal adhesions when plated on intact FN ( LeBaron et alI 988 ) . The experiments with ECM proteins and their fragments define the substrate requirements for focal adhesions : The ECM protein must contain an RGD sequence and usually a heparin - binding domain as well . Membrane Components Several integral membrane components have been identified in focal adhesions ( Table 1 ) . Most interest has been generated by the integrins for the obvious reason that the members of this family of proteins are receptors for ECM components . Because the integrins have been reviewed in detail ( Buck & Horwitz 1987a ; Hynes 1987 ; Ruoslahti & Pierschbacher 1987 ) , they are considered here only briefly . Two approaches led to the identi­ fication of the FN receptor , a member of the integrin family . In one approach , both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were generated , which perturbed cell adhesion ( Neff et al 1982 ; Greve & Gottlieb 1982 ; Tarone et al1982 ; Brown & Juliano 1985 ) . These antibodies have been used extensively to identify and characterize the cell surface proteins involved in adhesion ( Chapman 1984 ; Horwitz et al 1985 ; Knudsen et a11985 ; Hase­ gawa et al 1985 ; Giancotti et al 1985 , 1986 ) .

A different approach with mammalian cells used affinity chromatography of cell extracts on immobilized FN fragments , VN , or synthetic pep tides followed by elution with cell - binding domain peptides containing the RGD sequence ( Pytela et aI1985a , b ; Cheresh 1987 ; Cheresh & Spiro 1987 ) . This approach resulted in the isolation of distinct receptors for FN and VN ( Pytela et aI1985a , b ) ; in spite of binding to the common RGD sequence , these receptors displayed a narrow ligand specificity , binding either to FN or VN , but not to both . In contrast , other integrins interact with multiple ECM proteins . This is true for the avian integrin mentioned above , as well as for the mammalian integrin found on platelets , glycoproteins lIb / IlIa , which bind to FN , fibrinogen , and von Willebrand ' s factor ( Bennett & Vilaire 1979 ; Ruggeri et al 1982 ; Ginsberg et al 1983 ; Parise & Phillips 1986 ; Plow et a11985 ; Gardner & Hynes 1985 ; Pytela et aI1986 ) . Platelets , however , also contain a second form of integrin , glycoprotein le / IIa , with a narrower specificity , that binds FN but not these other ECM proteins ( Giancotti et a11987 ; Pischel et al1988 ; Piotrowicz et al 1988 ) . The integrins constitute a large family of receptors that have been detected across the animal kingdom , from nematodes and arthropods to frogs , birds , and mammals ( Bogaert et al1987 ; Leptin et a11987 ; DeSimone & Hynes 1988 ; Marcantonio & Hynes 1988 ; Hynes et al1988 ) .

Several oc and f3 chain genes have been cloned and sequenced . Each chain contains a putative transmembrane domain , a short C - terminal cytoplasmic domain , and a large extracellular domain . The predicted existence of a cytoplasmic sequence has been con­ firmed immunologically for the f3 chain ( Mueller et a11988 ; Marcantonio & Hynes 1988 ) . In general , the f3 chains show more homology between different receptors and across species than the (J( chains ; moreover , the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of f3 chains reveal considerable sequence homology ( Hynes 1987 ; Hynes et aI1988 ) . The distribution of integrin was explored in avian cells using the mono­ clonal antibodies ( mabs ) CSAT and JG22E , both of which perturb cell­ substrate adhesion . Migratory cells were labeled diffusely by these anti­ bodies , but more stationary cells revealed labeling of focal adhesions and , not surprisingly , of a fibrillar pattern on the cell surface coincident with bundles of FN ( Chen et al 1985b ; Damsky et al 1985 ) . The precise dis­ tribution ofintegrin detected in focal adhesions , however , was unexpected : The staining was concentrated at the periphery of these structures in a pattern like the eye of a needle . This uneven distribution appears to be the result of using these particular mabs since subsequent work with other antibodies indicated that integrin is distributed more uniformly throughout the focal adhesion ( Giancotti et al 1986 ; Kelly et aI1987 ) . The peripheral staining offocal adhesions obtained with CSAT or JG22E probably arises because these antibodies interact with epitopes that are more accessible at the periphery of these structures . It is worth noting that integrin in avian cells is concentrated even within those focal adhesions lacking FN . This suggests that the integrin binds to another ECM component , most probably VN . In mammalian cells , where distinct receptors exist for FN and VN , it is possible to ask which receptor is present in focal adhesions . Using antibodies specific for the (J( chains of each receptor , Singer and coworkers ( 1988 ) found that only the FN recep­ tor occurred in the focal adhesions of fibroblasts plated on FN , but when cells were plated in the presense of serum , both receptors were initially present in focal adhesions . However , as the cells began to assemble FN­ containing ECM fibers , the FN receptor was redistributed away from the focal adhesions to locations underlying these ECM bundles . With time , only the VN receptor was detected in the focal adhesions . In another study , however , only the VN receptor was detected in the focal adhesions formed by endothelial cells plated on serum - coated coverslips ( K . Fath , K . Burridge , unpublished observations ) . If these endothelial cells were plated on FN substrates , initially the FN receptor was expressed in focal adhesions , but in the presence of serum the FN receptor was progressively A nnu . R e v .

In most mature focal adhesions , the VN receptor is the pre­ dominant integrin isoform present . Since the cytoplasmic domains of the various integrins are so similar , we suspect that the specific integrin aggre­ gated in the focal adhesion is relatively unimportant and that any integrin clustered in the adhesion induces similar cytoplasmic organization . The existence of a transmembrane link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton has been recognized for some time . This has been based on morphological evidence ( Singer 1979 ; Chen & Singer 1982 ) , on functional studies in which FN added to transformed cells temporarily restored stress fibers ( Yamada et a11976 ; Ali et aI1977 ; Willingham et al 1977 ) , and on the observation that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton resulted in a loss of FN from the cell surface ( Ali & Hynes 1977 ; Kurkinen et al 1978 ) . The integrins are an obvious candidate for this linkage . Now we must understand how the cytoplasmic domains of the integrin t:J. and f3 chains associate with the cytoskeleton . The potential interactions of detergent­ solubilized integrin with various cytoskeletal proteins have been inves­ tigated . Binding was detected between integrin and talin , albeit with a low affinity ( Horwitz et al 1986 ) . This interaction is inhibited by a synthetic peptide corresponding to a conserved sequence in the integrin f3 chain cytoplasmic domain ( Buck & Horwitz 1987b ; P . Tapley et al unpublished observations ) . While this interaction between integrin and talin suggests one transmembrane link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton , the low affinity of the binding leads us to speculate that other proteins may also be involved . Of course , the observed low affinity could reflect inappropriate assay conditions or the absence of additional factors . Some support for the latter possibility has come from experiments examining the distribution of integrin and talin in avian lymphocytes . When integrin on the lympho­ cyte surface was aggregated and capped with antibodies , talin codistributed with integrin only if the cells were treated with tumor promoters ( Burn et al 1988 ) . These agents activate protein kinase C , which suggests that phosphorylation of one of these components may increase the affinity of their interaction . However , these effects should be contrasted with the disruption offocal adhesions in other cells by tumor promoters ( see below ) . Other integral membrane proteins have also been identified in focal adhesions such as the Herpes simplex virus D glycoprotein ( Norrild et al 1983 ) and the 30B6 antigen ( Rogalski & Singer 1985 ) . The 30B6 antigen shares many properties with integrin . Analysis of this antigen has been performed primarily in chicken gizzard , where it has a molecular weight of 130 , 000 and it is associated with a 175 - kDa polypeptide ( Rogalski & Singer 1985 ; Rogalski 1987 ) . Although molecular weights distinguish this complex from the avian integrins originally isolated from fibroblasts or A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

Consequently , we surmise that the 30B6 mab is binding to an integrin is oform ( Kelly et aI1987 ) . Cytoplasmic Components Vinculin and talin are two prominent components of focal adhesions ( Geiger 1979 ; Burridge & Feramisco 1980 ; Burridge & Connell 1983a ) . Within fibroblasts they also codistribute beneath bundles of FN ( Burridge & Feramisco 1980 ; Singer & Paradiso 1981 ; Burridge & Connell 1983a , b ) , but talin appears more abundant in fibroblast ruffling membranes ( Bur­ ridge & Connell 1983a ; Izzard 1988 ) . In other cell types , however , there are some distinct regions where the two proteins do not codistribute . As mentioned above , the zonula adherens junctions of epithelia stain prominently for vinculin but talin is not detected , which distinguishes cell­ ECM junctions from cell - cell junctions ( Geiger et al 1985 ) . Geiger and colleagues also noted that in the embryonic development of chicken gizzard , talin is detected within dense plaques prior to vinculin ( V olberg et aI1986 ) . Another situation where talin is concentrated without vinculin has been observed by Kupfer and colleagues who studied lymphocyte interactions . When cytotoxic T lymphocytes adhere to their target cells , talin but not vinculin is concentrated in the T cell at the site of adhesion ( Kupfer et al 1986 ) . Similarly , the adhesion of helper T cells to antigen­ presenting B cells results in the concentration of talin at the site of adhesion in the T cell ( Kupfer et al 1987 ) . These are clearly cell - cell interactions , and therefore one might predict that vinculin rather than talin would be localized at these sites of adhesion . Unlike epithelial zonula adherens junctions , however , these adhesive interactions involve members of the integrin family ( Kishimoto et al 1987 ) , which , as discussed above , are prominent in focal adhesions and have been shown to bind talin ( Horwitz et al 1986 ) . In spite of different distributions in some cell types , vinculin and talin purified from smooth muscle bind to each other with high affinity ( Burridge & Mangeat 1984 ) . Their independent behavior in some cells could be accounted for by certain isoforms of the two proteins that lack the appro­ priate binding site for the other protein . Isoforms of vinculin have been detected ( Geiger 1982 ; Gimona et aI1987 ) , and recent work on the cloning and sequencing of the vinculin gene support this possibility . Vinculin has been sequenced ( Price et al 1987 ) , and the potential talin - binding site has been localized within a 41 - amino acid sequence ( D . R . Critchley , personal communication ) . In one cDNA clone of the vinculin gene , this internal sequence was absent ( D . R . Critchley , personal communication ) . It is A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

FOCAL ADHESIONS 501 important to determine if this binding site is absent from vincu1in purified from cells in which the two proteins display distinct distributions . Never­ theless , direct binding to talin is not required for the localization ofvinculin to focal adhesions . Study of the expression of cloned vinculin genes with regions of the molecule deleted has revealed that deletion of the talin­ binding site does not affect the localization of this truncated vinculin in focal adhesions ( R . Bendori , D . Salomon , B . Geiger , personal com­ munication ) . Furthermore , vinculin can be added back to focal adhesions of extracted cells ( Avnur et al 1983 ) , in which its binding occurs inde­ pendently of talin ( Ball et al 1986 ) . These results , together with the finding of vinculin at membrane sites where talin is absent , indicate that other vinculin - binding proteins must be important for linking vinculin to the membrane . Several vinculin - b inding proteins , besides talin , have been detected using [ 1251 ] vinculin in Western blots and binding assays ( Otto 1983 ; Wilkins et al 1983 ; Burridge & Mangeat 1984 ; Koteliansky et al 1985 ; Belkin & Koteliansky 1987 ) , but most of these proteins have not been characterized . Shortly after vinculin was discovered , evidence was presented for an interaction with actin ( Jockusch & Isenberg 1981 ; Burridge & Feramisco 1982 ; Wilkins & Lin 1982 ) , but subsequent work revealed that this was due to contaminants in vinculin preparations ( Evans et al1984 ; Schroer & Wegner 1985 ; Wilkins & Lin 1986 ) ; more highly purified vinculin did not bind actin ( Evans et al 1984 ; Rosenfeld et a11985 ; Otto 1986 ) . Pursuit of the contaminating , actin­ binding activity led to the identification of a set of low molecular weight proteins referred to as HAl ( since these flowed through hydroxylapatite columns ) ( Wilkins & Lin 1986 ; Wilkins et aI1986 ) . Antisera raised against HAl reacted with much higher molecular weight bands ( 150 and 200 kDa ) ( Wilkins et a1 1986 ) that have been named tensin ( Wilkins et al 1987 ; Risinger et al 1987 ) . It is suspected that some of the HAl proteins are proteolytic fragments of tensin . The relationship of the two tensin bands is not clear . Antisera to tensin and HAl stain focal adhesions , and tensin binds to vinculin ( Wilkins et al 1987 ) . Although originally HAl was thought to cap the ends of actin filaments and therefore to regulate poly­ merization , it is not clear whether tensin or other proteins present in the contaminant fractions are responsible for this activity ( S . Lin , personal communication ) . Of the several cytoplasmic proteins in focal adhesions ( Table 1 ) , so far only fimbrin and a - actinin have been shown to bind actin directly . The only source from which fimbrin has been purified and characterized is microvilli , where it was first discovered ( Bretscher & Weber 1980 ) . It crosslinks actin filaments to form bundles in vitro ( Bretscher 1981 ) and is thought to have a bundling function in vivo since it is localized within the A nnu . R e v . C e ll .

The idea that fimbrin . may perform a similar role in focal adhesions remains to be tested . Although , by comparison 1¥ - actinin has been studied in much greater detail and has been cloned and sequenced ( Baron et ' al 1987a , b ) , its function remains elusive . Purified a - actinin crosslinks actin filaments in vitro but with relatively low affinity ( Bennett et al 1984 ; Sato et aI1987 ) , and with nonmusc1e a - actinin , the binding to actin is inhibited by calcium ( Burridge & Feramisco 1981 ) . When first identified in nonmuscle cells at the end of stress fibers , it was suggested that a - actinin attaches actin filaments to the plasma membrane ( Lazarides & Burridge 1975 ) . In part this suggestion was based on the assumption that a - actinin anchored thin filaments to the Z disc in skeletal muscle . However , this function has not been proved . It is interesting that 1¥ - actinin has been reported to be absent from the myotendinous junctions of skeletal muscle fibers ( Tidball 1987 ) and the dense plaques of smooth muscle cells ( Small 1985 ) , both prominent sites for anchorage of actin filaments to the membrane . Nevertheless , the possibility that a - actinin has a role in attachment of actin to focal adhesion mem­ branes has been suggested on the basis of its interaction with specific lipids and with vinculin . The binding of certain lipids by a - actinin has been noted ( Burn et aI1985 ) , but this is difficult to reconcile with the observation that a - actinin is farther from the focal adhesion membrane than other proteins such as vinculin ( Chen & Singer 1982 ) . An interaction between vinculin and a - actinin was first detected in Western blots or gel overlays using P25I ] vinculin ( Otto 1983 ; Wilkins et a11983 ; Burridge & Mangeat 1984 ) . A low affinity interaction between these two proteins has been detected in solution binding assays ( Craig 1985 ; Wachsstock et al 1987 ) . The interaction between vinculin and a - actinin suggests one way actin filaments may be anchored to the membrane ( illustrated in Figure 2 ) , but for several reasons ( discussed below ) , we suspect that there may be other , more important modes of attachment . It should be noted that in most cells a - actinin and vinculin have very different distributions : IX - actinin has a periodic distribution along stress fibers and only overlaps with vinculin where the stress fibers terminate at focal adhesions . If the interaction of these two proteins detected in vitro also occurs within the cell , then additional factors must regulate this interaction and confine vinculin to regions such as focal adhesions . Antisera have been used to reveal several additional proteins in focal adhesions . An antibody was raised against a 200 - kDa protein in prep­ arations of cardiac intercalated discs ( Maher & Singer 1983 ) . This antibody stained focal adhesions in fibroblasts and did not cross react with talin , which has a similar molecular weight . By screening nonimmunized rabbit sera , Beckerle ( 1986 ) discovered one serum that labeled focal adhesions in A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

PM=========t �r;.==::( FOCAL ADHESIONS 503 Figure 2 A diagram showing some of the interactions that have been determined in 'vitro for proteins in focal adhesions . Fibronectin ( FN ) or vitronectin ( VN ) are shown adsorbed to the glass . These ECM proteins are bound by integrin receptors composed of (X and P chains , both of which span the plasma membrane ( PM ) . The shape of the integrins is based on electron microscopic images ( L . Molony , unpublished observations ) . At the cytoplasmic face integrin binds talin ( TN ) , which in turn binds vinculin ( V ) . Talin is an elongated flexible molecule ( Molony et al 1987b ) whereas avian vinculin has a globular head domain and an elongated tail region ( Milam 1985 ) . Vinculin is shown interacting with (X - actinin «(X - A ) although it is not clear which parts of these molecules bind to each other . (X - actinin crosslinks actin filaments . Not shown in the diagram is the dimerization oftalin ( Molony et aI1987b ) . Several focal adhesion proteins have not been drawn because their interactions have not been determined . Undoubtedly another protein ( s ) in addition to talin is involved in linking vinculin to the membrane . Similarly , the possibility has been raised that actin may interact directly with integrin ( Painter et a11985 ; Molony et aI1987a ) . chicken but not mammalian cells . This antiserum reacted with a protein of about 82 kDa in both fibroblasts and smooth muscle . Compared with vinculin and talin , the 82 - kDa protein is a relatively minor component Of cells and tissues , which possibly suggests ' that it· may have a regulatory rather than a structural function ( Beckerle 1986 ) . By screening human autoantisera , Senecal and coworkers ( 1987 ) similarly identified two sera that label focal adhesions . The reactive antigens·were identified on Western blots as 80 - kDa and 75 - kDa proteins in one cell type , but in two other cell types both sera recognized a 54 - kDa band . These antigens require permeabilization of the _ cell for detection , which suggests that they are intracellular proteins .

Birchmeier , personal communication ) . Most of the proteins discussed above have been considered in the con­ text of how stress fibers are anchored to the plasma membrane at focal adhesions . As mentioned earlier , however , recent evidence has shown that the other two major filament types found in fibroblasts , microtubules , and the vimentin form of intermed iate filaments may also terminate in focal adhesions ( Geiger et a11984b ; Small & Rinnerthaler 1985 ; Green & Gold­ man 1986 ; Bershadsky et al 1987 ) . Little is known about the proteins involved in these attachments . Organization of Focal Adhesions Based on binding experiments in vitro , a chain of attachment of actin to the membrane is suggested ( Figure 2 ) , going sequentially via a - actinin , vinculin , and talin to integrin ; the latter spans the membrane and binds to ECM components outside the cell . Where possible , the proteins repre­ sented in Figure 2 have been drawn to scale , with their morphologies based on electron microscopic images ( e . g . Milam 1985 ; Molony et al 1987b ) . In general , the location of protein binding sites has not been determined ; for example , it is not known which part of the vinculin mol­ ecule binds to a - actinin , or vice versa . Several observations lead us to question the significance of this chain of protein interactions with respect to linking actin to the membrane in focal adhesions . Several of the interactions illustrated in Figure 2 are of relatively low affinity . Since tension generated in stress fibers is transmitted across the membrane at these sites , a series of low affinity links to the membrane would seem somewhat surprising . It should be remembered , however , that the interaction of integrin with FN is also of low affinity ( Horwitz et al 1985 ) ; yet this is certainly physiologically significant , as evidenced by the rounding up of cells treated with antibodies or peptides that disrupt this association . Clustering many of the components into close proximity should effectively overcome their tendency to dissociate and should result in a more stable attachment . In addition , talin dimerizes at high con­ centrations ( Molony et al 1987b ) , which are expected in focal adhesions . Talin dimers have not been illustrated in Figure 2 because their con­ formation is unknown , but they are expected to stabilize talin ' s association with vinculin and integrin as a result of crosslinking these components . Another observation that is difficult to reconcile with vinculin and talin playing a major role in anchoring actin to the membrane , is the high solubility of these components detected when cells are permeabilized with nonionic detergents . Both proteins dissociate quite rapidly from the focal A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

Since the cytoskeleton is generally defined as a detergent - insoluble matrix , talin and vinculin do not behave as typical cytoskeletal proteins . The apparent solubility of vinculin and talin under these conditions may again reflect the low affinity of their interactions , as well as the large dilution that usually accompanies permeabilization . Nevertheless , in these permeabilized cells , stress fibers still appear to be anchored to the ECM , which suggests that other linking proteins must be important or that only a small fraction of the talin and vinculin is required to maintain these linkages . Vinculin and talin may be involved in one chain of attachment , but additional ways of linking actin to the membrane may function in parallel at focal adhesions . Even in the erythrocyte , considered a simple model of actin association with a plasma membrane , two different attachment systems have been elucidated , one via spectrin and ankyrin to the integral membrane protein band 3 ( Branton et al 1981 ) , the other via protein 4 . 1 to the membrane protein glycophorin A ( Anderson & Marchesi 1985 ) . A more direct mode of attachment at focal adhesions is suggested by the observation that two different forms of integrin with actin tightly bound have been isolated ( Painter et al 1985 ; Molony et al 1987a ) . Pre­ liminary observations indicate that this association does not involve vincu­ lin , talin , or a - actinin ( our unpublished observations ) ; further character­ ization is in progress . These questions about the role of vinculin and talin raise the possibility that these proteins have some other function in addition to ( or instead of ) attachment . As discussed elsewhere in this review , focal adhesions serve as sites not only to anchor stress fibers but also to nucleate actin poly­ merization . One possibility , therefore , is that vinculin and talin may have some role in regulating actin nucleation at focal adhesions . It is obvious that the diagram in Figure 2 represents a very incomplete understanding of focal adhesion organization . FACTORS AFFECTING FOCAL ADHESIONS Hormones and Growth Factors Agents that elevate intracellular levels of cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) can have marked effects on cell morphology , the integrity of stress fibers , and focal adhesions . The same agent , however , can have opposite effects in different cell types . Many virally transformed cells , as well as Chinese hamster ovary cells , respond to elevated cAMP by adhering more tightly to the substrate , flattening , and developing stress fibers and focal adhesions ( Pastan & Willingham 1978 ; Leader et aI1983 ) . Many other cells in culture respond in the opposite manner when stimulated by these agents . In many of A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

This behavior has been noted with thyroid cells in response to thyrotropin ( Westermark & Porter 1982 ) , with bone cells in response to parathyroid hormone ( Aubin et aI1983 ) , and with ovarian granulosa cells in response to follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , prostaglandin E1 and E2 , and chol­ era toxin ( Lawrence et aI1979 ) . In Balb / c - 3T3 cells , stress fibers were lost in response to cholera toxin ; this was accompanied by a loss of vinculin staining from the focal adhesions ( Herman & Pledger 1985 ) . All the effects of cAMP are believed to occur through its activation of the cAMP - depen­ dent protein kinase . In a recent study , the catalytic subunit of this enzyme , which is active in the absence of the regulatory subunit , was microinjected into fibroblasts . This resulted in the dissolution of stress fibers ( Lamb et al 1988 ) , with a subsequent loss of focal adhesions ( J . R . Feramisco , personal communication ) . Several mitogenic growth factors also affect focal adhesions in receptive cells . For example , in the human epidermoid carcinoma line A431 , epi­ dermal growth factor ( EGF ) stimulates increased membrane ruffling and disassembly of stress fibers as well as focal adhesions , as judged by staining for a - actinin ( Schlessinger & Geiger 1981 ) . Similarly , treatment of quies­ cent Balb / c - 3T3 cells with platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ) caused disassembly of stress fibers and a rapid mobilization of vinculin out offocal adhesions ( Herman & Pledger 1985 ) . Surprisingly , some focal adhesion staining with anti - talin remained in response to PDGF , which suggests that the structures were not fully disassembled , but components such as vinculin were selectively released . A similar loss of vinculin from the focal adhesions of cultured smooth muscle cells has also been noted in response to PDGF ( Herman et al 1987 ) . On its own , PDGF renders Balb / c - 3T3 cells competent to respond to other factors such as EGF , insulin , or whole plasma , which stimulate DNA synthesis ( Pledger et al 1977 ) . PDGF is a competence factor for these cells ; other competence factors , such as fibro­ blast growth fa ctor , transforming growth factor p , and cholera toxin , also induced vinculin mobilization in these cells ( Herman et al 1986 ) . The sequence of events leading to vinculin mobilization was investigated using a number of pharmacological reagents . It was concluded that activation of phospholipase C followed by elevated intracellular free calcium was important in mobilizing vinculin ( Herman et aI1986 ) . The loss ofvinculin from focal adhesions was inhibited by specific protease inhibitors , which indicates that proteolysis , either ofvinculin or possibly some other protein , was involved . Some of these protease inhibitors are known to affect the type II isoform of the calcium - dependent protease ( calpain II ) , which is concentrated in focal adhesions ( Beckerle et al 1987 ; see below ) .

Tumor Promoters Tumor promoters are compounds that are not carcinogenic themselves but increase the frequency of tumors in animals previously exposed to carcinogens . Tumor promoters activate protein kinase C , the calcium­ activated , phospholipid - dependent protein kinase that has been implicated in the mitogenic response of various growth factors , such as EGF and PDGF . The response of cultured cells to tumor promoters is often dra­ matic ; the cells develop many of the characteristics of virally transformed cells . Epithelial cells often display the most pronounced response to tumor promoters , and the effect of these agents on the epithelial cytoskeleton has been investigated by several laboratories . Schliwa and coworkers ( 1984 ) found that the potent tumor promoter 1 - 0 - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - ace­ tate ( TPA ) caused the disassembly of stress fibers in BSC - l cells . The first signs of disruption , of stress fibers could be detected within 2 min of TPA application ; this was paralleled by extensive ruffling at the cell margins . The disruption of focal adhesions was confirmed both by IRM and by vinculin immunofluorescence . Accompanying its loss from focal ad­ hesions , vinculin could be detected within the membrane ruffles . The disruption of stress fibers induced by TPA preceded the loss of vinculin from focal adhesions , a sequence opposite to that reported for Balb / c - 3T3 cells responding to PDGF ( Herman & Pledger 1985 ) . Different cell types , as well as different agents , probably account for these apparently con­ flicting results . A similar disruption of stress fibers was observed in Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells in response to TPA ( Kellie et al 1985 ) . In this study it was shown that the ratio of filamentous to monomeric actin was unaffected by TPA even though the cells underwent a major reor­ ganization of their micro filament cytoskeleton . The effects ofTPA on BSC - 1 cells have also been studied in live cells microinjected with fluorescent 0(­ actinin and vinculin by Meigs & Wang ( 1986 ) , who noted that focal adhesions , as judged by IRM and vinculin distribution , persisted longer than stress fibers following TPA treatment . However , they noted that the O( - actinin in focal adhesions was more labile than that in stress fibers . To­ gether with the observation of the selective mobilization of vinculin in response to PDGF , this striking result implies that the interaction of these proteins can be uncoupled and that they can behave independently . The disassembly of focal adhesions in response to tumor promoters has led to a search for relevant substrates for protein kinase C in these regions . Both vinculin and talin have been shown to be substrates for this enzyme A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

The effects of these phosphorylations on the interactions ofvinculin and talin have not been determined . Whereas TPA results in a disruption of focal adhesions in epithelial cells , in lymphocytes it enhances the association of talin with integrin that has been capped by antibody - induced crosslinking ( Burn et aI1988 ) . Viral Transformation There are dramatic differences in morphology and behavior between cells transformed by oncogenic viruses and their normal counterparts . Typ­ ically , transformed cells are more rounded and less adherent than normal cells ; they have reduced focal adhesions and few , if any , stress fibers . Different viruses induce distinct morphologies in the same cell type , which suggests that some of these changes may be brought about in different ways . Both intra - and extra - cellular factors have been invoked . Most transformed cells show alterations at the cell surface , and it is pro bable that these changes contribute to a loss of focal adhesions . Almost all transformed cells show a decrease in surface FN ( Hynes 1973 ) due to altered patterns of synthesis and increased degradation of this protein ( Olden & Yamada 1977 ) . The loss of FN from the cell surface would be expected to diminish focal adhesions . Indeed , in some cases addition ofFN to transformed cells can temporarily restore a more normal morphology ( Yamada et al1976 ; Ali et alI 977 ; Willingham et aI1977 ) , including focal adhesions ( Chen et aI1986 ) . It has been known for a long time that FN is particularly sensitive to proteolysis ( Hynes 1973 ) and that transformed cells have increased levels of proteases at the cell surface ( Unkeless et al 1973 ) . Several of the proteases detected at the surface oftransformed cells are also synthesized by normal cells ( for review , see Chen & Chen 1987 ) , but transformation by some viruses may also induce new surface proteases ( Chen & Chen 1987 ) . For example , transformation by Rous sarcoma virus induces novel proteases , which are expressed at sites of adhesion ( Chen et a11984 ) and degrade FN ( Chen et aI1985a ) . One protease that has been implicated in the degradation of the ECM both by transformed and normal cells during tissue remodelling is plasmin . This enzyme is widely distributed within the ECM as an inactive precursor , plasminogen , which is converted to plasmin by the protease plasminogen activator . Plasminogen activator and plasmin have been implicated in FN degradation ( Quigley 1979 ; Fairbairn et al 1985 ) . Of considerable significance for the stability of focal adhesions is the discovery that one type of plasminogen activator , urokinase , is concentrated at the extra­ cellular face of these adhesions ( Pollanen et a11987 , 1988 ; Hebert & Baker A nnu .

F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y . FOCAL ADHESIONS 509 1988 ) . In most normal cells this enzyme is probably maintained in an inactive state due to the presence of a specific inhibitor . This inhibitor is distributed diffusely beneath cultured cells , including their focal adhesions ( Pollanen et al1987 ) . The cytoskeletal and adhesive alterations that result from trans­ formation have been extensively studied in RSV - transformed cells . Undoubtedly , the external factors discussed above contribute to the decreased adhesion and altered cytoskeletons in these cells , but there is also evidence that some of the effects of the virus may be exerted directly on the cytoskeleton . Although cells transformed by RSV have reduced focal adhesions , those that persist contain elevated levels of the trans­ forming protein pp60v•src ( Rohrschneider 1980 ) . After it was discovered that pp60v - src is a tyrosine - s pecific protein kinase ( Hunter & Sefton 1980 ) , a search was initiated for potential cytoskeletal substrates for this enzyme . Vinculin was the first cytoskeletal protein shown to contain phospho­ tyrosine , and the level of phospho tyrosine in vinculin was found to increase significantly following RSV - transformation ( Sefton et al1981 ) . This find­ ing , together with the localization of pp60v - src within focal adhesions , led to the idea that phosphorylation of target proteins such as vinculin might result in focal adhesion disassembly . Subsequent experiments , however , have not supported this suggestion . Not only is the level of phos­ photyrosine in vinculin low , but several studies using viral mutants failed to show a correlation between the level of phosphotyrosine in vinculin and the transformed phenotype ( Rohrschneider & Rosok 1983 ; Iwashita et al 1983 ; Antler et al 1985 ; Rohrschneider & Reynolds 1985 ; Kellie et al 19 86a , b ; Nigg et al 1986 ) . Rosok & Rohrschneider ( 1983 ) investigated whether a transient increase in phospho tyrosine occurs as normal cells disassemble stress fibers upon entering mitosis , but no change in the level of vinculin phosphorylation was detected at any stage in the cell cycle . These results lead to the conclusion that phosphorylation ofvinculin on tyrosine residues is irrelevant to the transformed phenotype ; the phos­ phorylation possibly results from a fortuitous proximity to pp60src , which behaves as a promiscuous kinase . Nevertheless , it could still be argued that only the small population of vinculin found in focal adhesions is relevant and that significant changes in this population are obscured by a large soluble pool . Although it seems unlikely , this possibility gains some credence from experiments with a nontransforming mutant of RSV . This virus synthesizes a nonmyristylated form ofpp60v - srC , which becomes cyto­ solie and no longer localizes in focal adhesions ( Kamps et al 1986 ) . However , the level of phosphotyrosine in vinculin from cells infected with this virus is higher than that from cells transformed with wild - type RSV ( Kamps et al1986 ) . This suggests that the level of phosphorylation of the A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y . 510 BURRIDGE ET AL cytoplasmic pool ofvinculin does not affect focal adhesions or stress fibers . The state of phosphorylation of vinculin within the focal adhesion itself is not known . Vinculin is also phosphorylated on serine and threonine resi­ dues , but the significance of any of these phosphorylations remains to be determined . Two other focal adhesion proteins , talin and integrin , also contain elevated phospho tyrosine levels following transformation by RSV ( Pas­ quale et al 1986 ; Declue & Martin 1987 ; Hirst et al 1986 ) . The level of phosphotyrosine in talin , as in vinculin , has not been found to correlate with the transformed phenotype ( Declue & Martin 1987 ) , which suggests that this phosphorylation may also be without consequences . Equivalent studies have not yet been performed on integrin , but it is interesting that integrin , unlike vinculin or talin , is phosphorylated by several tyrosine kinases in addition to pp60v - src ( Hirst et al 1986 ) . One of the phos­ phorylation sites occurs on a tyrosine in the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin p chain in a sequence that is similar to the autophosphorylation site in the EGF receptor ( Hirst et al 1986 ; Tamkun et al 1986 ) . This tyrosine is in a region involved in talin binding ( P . Tapley et aI , unpublished observations ; Buck & Horwitz 1987b ) . Furthermore , integrin isolated from RSV - transformed cells has a decreased affinity for talin ( P . Tapley et aI , unpublished observations ; Buck & Horwitz 1987b ) , but it has not been shown whether this is due to phosphorylation or some other modification . Abnormal " Rosette " Adhesions ( " Podosomes " ) in RSV - transformed Cells Cells transformed by RSV and related viruses carrying similar tyrosine kinases frequently reveal abnormal adhesions to the substrate . These were first detected when the distributions of vinculin and ct - actinin were ex­ amined in RSV - transformed fibroblasts ( David - Pfeuty & Singer 1980 ) . Instead of normal focal adhesions , these investigators noted clusters of small adhesions ( " rosettes " ) that often occurred under the nucleus rather than at the periphery like normal focal adhesions . These same structures were detected as aggregates of F - actin when the organization of actin was examined in various transformed cells ( Carley et al1981 ; Carley & Webb 1983 ) . Like focal adhesions , rosettes are regions of the cell surface where the plasma membrane comes close to the underlying substrate , generating dark images by IRM . However , these rosette adhesions differ in several ways from the focal adhesions of normal cells . They are much smaller and appear more like protrusions from the ventral cell surface towards the substrate . Because of their footlike morphology they have also been given the name " podosomes " ( Tarone et al 1985 ) [ this name has been used previously in another context ( Davies & Stossel1977 ) ] .

FOCAL ADHESIONS 5 1 1 the proteins found in focal adhesions have been found in these structures as well ( Table 2 ) , immunofluorescence has revealed a protein organization not detected in focal adhesions . Each po do some or rosette adhesion con­ tains a core of actin filaments together with oc - actinin and fimbrin . The core is surrounded by vinculin and talin , which appear as rings by immuno­ fluorescence microscopy ( Burridge & Connell 1983a , b ; Marchisio et al 1984 , 1987 ) . Unlike normal focal adhesions , rosette adhesions or podo­ somes form on naked glass coverslips in the absence of serum ( Tarone et aI1985 ) . Perhaps related to this lack of requirement for an ECM , integrin is not usually concentrated within these abnormal adhesions ( Chen et al 1986 ; Giancotti et a11986 ) although in a minority of cells it was detected as a diffuse corona of staining around the adhesion ( Chen et aI1986 ) . Compared with focal adhesions , these rosette adhesions or podosomes are much more dynamic structures . Microinjection of fluorescent oc - actinin into cells transformed by RSV allowed <these stdUc t ur e s to be observed in living cells ( Stickel & Wang 1987 ) . It was noticed that rosette adhesions incorporated oc - actinin rapidly and underwent assembly and disassembly within a period of a few minutes . In some cases adjacent adhesions within a cluster moved closer or farther apart . The .dynamics of oc - actinin within these structures was also studied using 'fluorescence recovery after pho­ tobleaching . This demonstrated a vary rapid turnover of oc - actinin within Table 2 Proteins localized in rosette adhesions ( podosomes ) Nonnal cells Virus transfonned cells ( Osteoclasts , ' maorqph�ges , monocytes ) Actina , b , c , d ( RSV , A - muLV , Y73 / ESV , FSV ) Actin " f , g Vinculina , c , d Talinb , d cx - Actinina , c , d Fimbrinc a Lehto et al 1982 b Burridge & Connell 1983b , Marchisio et al 1984 d Marchisio et al 1987 e Carley et al 1981 f Carley et al 1985 gTarone et al1985 Vinculing , h Talinb , i cx - Actininf , h Fimbrinf Gelsolini p60v - sn:k•1 p l2oy·gag . o blm p90y·gag·yes " p80y·ga g ·yes " b David - Pfeuty & Singer 1980 i Burridge & Connell 1983a iWanget al1984 k Nigg et al 1982 1 Krueger et al 1984 . , Rohrschneider & Najita 1984 n Gentry & Rohrschneider 1984 A nnu .

In normal focal adhesions the exchange of IX - actinin was slow : 50 % re­ covery required more than 5 minutes ( Stickel & Wang 1987 ) . The lack of stability of these structures is interesting and may relate to their low levels of integrin and lack of ECM components . In turn , this absence of ECM components may reflect the increased proteolysis that occurs at these sites ( Chen et a1 1984 ) and may involve novel membrane - associated proteases ( Chen & Chen 1987 ) . Rosette adhesions or podosomes have been detected in many trans­ fQrmed cells ( Carley et al 1981 ) , but they are most prominent in cells transformed by viruses carrying oncogenes encoding tyrosine kinases , such as src ( David - Pf euty & Singer 1980 ) , abl ( Rohrschneider & Najita 1984 ) , yes ( Gentry & Rohrschneider 1984 ) , and ips ( Tarone et al 1985 ) . The products of the src , abl , and yes genes have also been detected in these adhesions ( Nigg et a11982 ; Krueger et al 1984 ; Rohrschneider & Najita 1984 ; Gentry & Rohrschneider 1984 ) . Similar ( probably identical ) struc­ tures have been identified in several normal cell types . Aggregates of F­ actin were detected in spreading macrophages by electron microscopy ( Trotter 1981 ) . Using antibodies against actin , IX - actinin and vinculin , these structures were noted by immunofluorescence in monocytes as they differ­ entiated into macrophages in culture ( Lehto et aI1982 ) . Some of the most extensive arrays of these podosomes have been detected in osteoclasts ( Marchisio et a11984 , 1987 ) . The significance of these structures and their relationship to focal adhesions is not clear . It is interesting , however , that the normal cells in which they are found tend to be " invasive " and express proteases at their surfaces . It may be that these rosette adhesions or podosomes are normally involved in local degradation of the ECM . Per­ haps transformation by RSV and related viruses induces fibroblasts to express the degradative and invasive characteristics normally found in cells such as macrophages and osteoclasts . SIGNALING The ECM influences many aspects of cell behavior , including movement , morphology , differentiation , and proliferation . It seems probable that many ofthe effects of the ECM are signaled to the cell through its adhesions to the substrate . An example of a complex response initiated by adhesion is platelet activation . Damage to blood vessel walls results in the adhesion of platelets to the exposed subendothelial ECM ( George etaI1984 ) . This adhesion , together with the action of agonists such as thrombin , triggers a cascade of events that comprise platelet activation . During this process there is secretion by the platelet of ECM components and factors that A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y . FOCAL ADHESIONS 513 potentiate platelet adhesion in a positive feedback manner . In addition , activation induces changes in the adhesive properties of the platelet surface that are necessary for platelet aggregation and that allow the platelet integrin , glycoproteins lIb / IlIa , to bind fibrinogen ( Shattil et a11985 ; Niiya et aI1987 ) . These adhesive events are accompanied by actin polymerization and a change in platelet shape . Several lines of evidence indicate that the platelet glycoproteins lIb / IlIa may playa role in signal generation through interactions with ion channels . In epinephrine - stimulated platelets it was found that fibrinogen binding to lIb / IlIa appeared to be necessary to maintain the induced Na + / H + ex­ change ( Banga et aI1986 ) . Glycoproteins lIb / IlIa may also aff ect calcium homeostasis , as evidenced by platelets from thrombasthenic patients that lack this glycoprotein complex . The influx of calcium is reduced in their platelets by about 50 % ( Brass 1985 ) . Calcium influx was similarly per­ turbed in normal platelets by conditions that dissociated the lIb / IlIa complex ( Brass 1985 ) . Conformational changes in the lIb / IlIa complex were induced by ligand binding in vitro ( Parise et al 1987 ) . These con­ formational changes may regulate the interaction of this integrin with other components either in the membrane or at its cytoplasmic face . If integrins do interact with calcium channels , the high concentration of integrin within focal adhesions may be significant . Calcium fluxes at these sites of adhesion could have many effects . In this respect , it is interesting that one calcium regulated enzyme , the type II isoform of the calcium­ dependent protease ( CDPII ) calpain II , has been localized to focal adhesions ( Beckerle et aI1987 ) . The function of this enzyme has not been determined , but several cytoskeletal proteins are substrates , and among focal adhesion proteins , talin is particularly susceptible ( Collier & Wang 1982 ; O ' Halloran et al 1985 ; Beckerle et al 1986 ) . It is easy to envisage schemes in which focal adhesion disassembly is triggered by the calcium­ dependent proteolysis of talin or other proteins . This hypothesis is being investigated currently , but it is noteworthy that in platelets calcium - depen­ dent proteolysis oftalin has been shown to occur physiologically although the significance of this process has not been determined ( Fox et aI1985 ) . Evidence that integrins in other cells may also generate signals in response to binding ECM proteins has come from experiments with mono­ cytes . These cells contain an integrin receptor , Mac - I , for C3bj ( a com­ plement fragment ) , which under normal conditions mediates attachment of monocytes to erythrocytes coated with C3bj• However , phagocytosis of these C3bj - coated erythrocytes does not occur unless the cells are stimu­ lated with either tumor promoting phorbol esters or substrate - bound fibronectin ( Wright & Silverstein 1982 ; Wright et aI1983 ) . Presumably the fibronectin binds to a second class of integrin receptors on these A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

It is important to pursue this signaling pathway further and to determine whether integrins in other situations can generate similar cytoplasmic signals . The identification of potential regulatory proteins , including viral tyro­ sine kinases within focal adhesions ( Table 3 ) , supports the idea that these regions may be involved in transmembrane signaling . The presence of kinases in the adhesions of cells transformed by parti<;.ular viruses raises the question of whether equivalent kinases are concentrated within the focal adhesions of normal cells . The level of the homologous tyrosine kinases in nontransformed cells are too low to detect by immuno­ fluorescence microscopy , but elevated levels of phospho tyrosine have been detected in the focal adhesions of normal cells ( Maher et al 1985 ) . This striking observation indicates that some tyrosine kinases , quite possibly the homologues of the viral enzymes , are indeed concentrated at the cytoplasmic face _ of focal adhesions . It is important to determine the functions of the kinases at this site . FUTURE DIRECTIONS In recent years , considerable progress has been made in identifying focal adhesion components and characterizing their interactions . Finding integ­ rins concentrated at these sites has drawn attention to these ECM receptors as critical elements in the transmembrane link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton . Based on binding experiments in vitro , it is possible to construct a chain of proteins linking actin to integrin , but the low affinity of some of these interactions leads us to conclude that other proteins must also function in the attachment of actin filaments to the focal adhesion membrane . New proteins continue to be discovered at focal adhesions . Their identification and the characterization of their interactions are A nnu . R e v . C e ll . B i o l . 1988 . 4 : 487 - 525 .

Several regulatory proteins have been identified in focal adhesions and many aspects of cell behavior are determined by cell adhesion to the ECM , which suggests that transmembrane signaling occurs at these sites . The involvement of integrins in generating second messengers at focal ad­ hesions in response to binding ECM components and the nature of the signals thus generated are tantalizing topics for future investigation .
