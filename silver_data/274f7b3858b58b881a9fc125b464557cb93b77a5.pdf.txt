How do Visualization Designers Think ? Design Cognition as a Core Aspect of Visualization Psychology Paul Parsons * Purdue University A BSTRACT There are numerous opportunities for engaging in research at the intersection of psychology and visualization . While most oppor - tunities taken up by the VIS community will likely focus on the psychology of users , there are also opportunities for studying the psychology of designers . In this position paper , I argue the impor - tance of studying design cognition as a necessary component of a holistic program of research on visualization psychology . I provide a brief overview of research on design cognition in other disciplines , and discuss opportunities for VIS to build an analogous research program . Doing so can lead to a stronger integration of research and design practice , can provide a better understanding of how to educate and train future designers , and will likely surface both challenges and opportunities for future research . 1 I NTRODUCTION Psychology is undoubtedly important for visualization research and practice . Numerous scholars have pointed to the need for better integration of the two ﬁelds , especially as an expansion beyond per - ception to focus on higher - level cognitive processes and structures . However , virtually all calls for more of this kind of research focus entirely on users and not on designers . Although more research on user psychology is indeed necessary , it can provide only a partial view of the ways in which visualizations are created and used . Most disciplines with a robust relationship between research and prac - tice have developed research programs investigating how designers think while engaged in their design practice , commonly referred to as design cognition . These include both longstanding ﬁelds like architecture [ 21 ] and emergent ﬁelds like instructional design [ 27 ] , graphic design [ 33 ] , and user experience design [ 16 ] . These disci - plines have all recognized the value of studying how designers think and know as a valid and useful complement to studying the psycho - logical aspects of the use of artifacts . The integration of these two perspectives can lead to a more holistic view of how visualizations are created and used . Design research in VIS has largely been model driven , where attempts are made to codify aspects of design in abstract forms . Pop - ular examples include process models ( e . g . , Design Study Method - ology [ 30 ] , Design Activity Framework [ 23 ] ) and decision mod - els ( e . g . , Nested Blocks [ 25 ] , Nested Blocks and Guidelines [ 24 ] ) . While the latter models focus on decisions that designers can or should make in design situations , they do not engage with decision making at the level of cognitive processes or structures . Thus there is a gap in our understanding of how and why design decisions are made , and the psychological factors that inﬂuence their outcomes . In this position paper , I argue that there is a need to focus on design cognition in VIS research . I provide a brief overview of research on design cognition in other disciplines , and discuss oppor - tunities for VIS to build an analogous research program . Doing so can lead to a stronger integration of research and design practice , * e - mail : parsonsp @ purdue . edu can provide a better understanding of how to educate and train future designers , and will likely surface both challenges and opportunities for future research . 2 D ESIGN C OGNITION How do designers formulate and solve design problems ? What kinds of cognitive processes do they rely on while doing so ? These are the types of questions asked by researchers studying design cognition . Rather than foregrounding the methods , tools , or outcomes of design - ers , studies in design cognition investigate how and why designers think the ways they do while designing . Design cognition has been studied across a wide variety of domains , including engineering [ 2 ] , architecture [ 21 ] , computer science [ 5 ] , instructional design [ 27 ] , and graphic design [ 33 ] . Across these disciplines , many aspects of cognition in design have been investigated , including , among oth - ers , episodic memory [ 19 ] , ﬁxation [ 28 ] , chunking [ 22 ] , bias [ 13 ] , abductive reasoning [ 7 ] , analogical reasoning [ 34 ] , metacognitive monitoring and control [ 3 ] , and recall [ 9 ] . Much of the research on design cognition is concerned with how designers navigate the complexity and uncertainty of real - world de - sign situations [ 4 , 31 , 32 ] . A number of core strategies have been iden - tiﬁed through empirical investigation , including conjecture - based problem formulation , problem - solution co - evolution , analogical rea - soning , mental simulation , and xated solution generation [ 3 , 15 ] . Many of the cognitive processes that are relevant for studying the use of visualizations are also important for understanding their design . For instance , studies have shown that designers rely on chunking to ideate effectively [ 22 ] , employ abductive reasoning during concept selection [ 14 ] , are inﬂuenced by color in ways that bias their think - ing while sketching [ 13 ] , and struggle with ﬁxation while generating ideas [ 8 ] . Given the considerable evidence of such issues impact - ing design across numerous disciplines , it is very likely that these are also important for understanding how and why visualization designers design the ways they do . Although it may be tempting to simply borrow these ﬁndings from these other disciplines and apply them to VIS , research has shown that signiﬁcant differences exist in design cognition across domains , even though there are similarities [ 35 ] . For instance , Akin [ 1 ] notes signiﬁcant differences in design cognition among engineers and architects , and Purcell and Gero [ 28 ] identiﬁes differences between mechanical engineers and product designers . In a review paper examining design across numerous domains , Visser [ 35 ] afﬁrms both these differences and similarities , and speculates that these differences may have implications for the kinds of knowledge that designers rely on . Following this work , it is reasonable to assume that design cog - nition in VIS will share similarities with these other ﬁelds , yet will also have its own unique characteristics . For instance , designers in other ﬁelds do not deal with issues regarding data , mapping abstract information onto visual forms , and interactivity in the ways that VIS designers must . Research on design cognition has signiﬁcantly inﬂu - enced theory , practice , and education in numerous design ﬁelds [ 18 ] , and could similarly do so for VIS . However , the particular facets of VIS that make it different from engineering or graphic design , for instance , must be carefully examined as a part of such an effort . a r X i v : 2009 . 13758v1 [ c s . H C ] 29 S e p 2020 2 . 1 Design and Applied Research One possible reason why VIS has not seen a focus on design cog - nition , and design practice more broadly , is a common assump - tion that design is simply an application of knowledge generated from scientiﬁc research . This view suggests that if designers know enough—if they understand the principles and concepts that come from research—then they can apply them in their work . For instance , if enough studies are done on visual encoding and perception , or memorability and embellishment , or bias and chart types , designers just have to know the results and determine how to apply them in context . This view was prominent in multiple design ﬁelds decades ago , but has since largely been abandoned by design scholars , as it does not accurately reﬂect the true nature of design practice [ 10 , 20 ] . While scientiﬁc knowledge certainly plays a role in design , it is not sufﬁcient for good design [ 32 ] . Rather , designers rely on a host of personal and situated factors , along with more formal types of knowledge , to engage appropriately with the complexity of design practice [ 26 ] . Buchanan [ 4 ] articulates how widespread this assump - tion has been , noting that “each of the sciences that have come into contact with design has tended to regard design as an ‘applied’ ver - sion of its own knowledge” , emphasizing the mistake of viewing design as simply a “practical demonstration” of scientiﬁc ﬁndings . Thus , even if a robust program of research at the intersection of psychology and visualization is developed , if its scope is limited to users only—and especially if design is viewed as an application of research ﬁndings—we will fail to understand how to inﬂuence design practice effectively . 3 O PPORTUNITIES AND R ESEARCH Q UESTIONS Because the study of design cognition has a rich history in other disciplines , yet is still nascent in VIS , research questions can be translated from ﬁelds like architecture , instructional design , and others , and posed in a VIS context . For instance , much research has focused on the differences between novice and expert designers , and research questions can be generated to investigate these differences , including : How do novices and experts differ with respect to framing problems involving complex datasets and use cases ? Are experts capable of more ﬂexible ways of recognizing and framing problems ? How do novices and experts differ with respect to chunking while generating ideas for chart types ? Do experts engage in more ad - vanced chunking strategies that allow for nuanced application of principles regarding visual encodings or embellishments ? Another line of research can select individual concepts or topics to study . For instance , with respect to creativity , the ways in which cognitive strategies are used during ideation , and how designers may get ﬁxated on certain things , can be examined . Given an example of a well - known visualization for a particular kind of data and context , do designers become ﬁxated on that particular type of solution , unable to see viable alternatives ? And what kinds of supports can be given to mitigate that ﬁxation ? Another line of research may characterize the similarities and dif - ferences among VIS and other ﬁelds with respect to design cognition . For instance , do VIS designers rely on abductive reasoning in similar ways to instructional designers ? Is mental simulation different for VIS designers and UX designers ? And what kinds of metacognitive strategies do VIS designers rely on that may be similar or different to software engineers ? A different approach can start with the more universal processes of design cognition , using those to investigate differences in novices and experts or speciﬁc cognitive processes and structures . In his seminal work , Cross [ 11 , 12 ] articulated two fundamental processes of design cognition : problem formulation and solution generation . These two processes are fairly abstract , yet are essential aspects of design and are thus mostly universal . Problem formulation refers to processes in which designers make sense of ill - deﬁned situations and determine the ‘problem’ and its implications . Solution generation refers to processes in which designers move from a problem to a satisfactory solution . This could be a reasonable starting point for design cognition research in VIS . Designers could be recruited and given a problem brief comprising a dataset , target users , and set of tasks that users need to accomplish . Their verbalizations could be captured and analyzed , with speciﬁc attention paid to known indicators of these cognitive processes . For instance , it is generally recognized that during problem formulation designers attend to speciﬁc aspects of the problem space by naming them , articulating relevant concerns as part of the problem frame , and articulating a coherent narrative that helps guide subsequent design decisions [ 29 ] . The possibilities noted here are only a small sample , and it is certain that this list is far from exhaustive . There are likely dozens of research questions that can be posed based on prior studies on other areas . However , the ideas mentioned here are simply a starting point to begin a discussion on engaging in this kind of research . 3 . 1 Research Approaches Previous research has heavily relied on “protocol studies” to investi - gate the nature of design cognition [ 11 , 15 ] . This method , which is already well - known to VIS researchers doing human - subjects stud - ies , involves asking designers to ‘think - aloud’ while doing a design activity . These studies generate verbal protocols that can be tran - scribed and analyzed with the goal of uncovering aspects of thinking and reasoning . This kind of approach can be taken with individual designers who work alone on design problems , or with teams of designers working together . Team - based protocols can be used to elicit socio - cognitive facets of collaborative design cognition . Similar to other aspects of VIS research , designers can be studied in both controlled settings , such as a lab or workshop , and in less controlled settings , such in their everyday design settings . Studies in controlled settings are beneﬁcial as they allow common design tasks to be given to participants , and allow for the control of vari - ables , including time spent , access to resources , and so on . Although empirical lab studies are commonly employed in design research ( e . g . , [ 6 , 17 ] ) , they differ from realistic practitioner contexts in a number of ways . For instance , lab studies may exclude factors that shape design work in commercial settings , including the effects of organizational culture , project timescales , project management and workload . Lab studies may also present participants with rela - tively simple problems over short time periods , which are not often representative of real - world design tasks . As is often the case in experimental research , there is the risk of reducing both ecologi - cal and external validity [ 6 ] . For these reasons , it is beneﬁcial to conduct studies in both controlled “lab” settings and “in the wild” of real - world practice . Studies can employ a range of methods , in - cluding protocol analysis , semi - structured interviews , diary studies , contextual observations , and co - design workshops . 4 S UMMARY There are numerous opportunities for engaging in research at the intersection of psychology and visualization . While most oppor - tunities taken up by the VIS community will likely focus on the psychology of users , there are also opportunities for studying the psychology of designers . In this position paper , I have argued the importance of studying design cognition as a necessary component of a holistic program of research on visualizaiton psychology . Per - haps the most obvious implication for this kind of research is in the education and training of future visualization designers . However , there are also implications for research and design practice . Un - derstanding design cognition can help generate research topics and questions for the research community , and can stimulate the creation of design methods , concepts , and other types of design knowledge that can be used in practice .
