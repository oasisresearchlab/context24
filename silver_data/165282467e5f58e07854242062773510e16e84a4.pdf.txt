Abstract Introduction : A critical step in understanding and preventing running - related injuries ( RRIs ) is appropriately defining RRIs . Current definitions of RRIs may not represent the full process of injury development , failing to capture lower levels of injury that many athletes continue to train through . Understanding runners’ description and management of the injury development process may allow for a more appropriate examination of all levels of injury . This study aimed to examine recreational runners’ description and management of the injury development process . Methods : A qualitative focus group study was undertaken . Seven semi - structured focus groups with male ( n = 13 ) and female ( n = 18 ) recreational runners took place . Focus groups were audio and video recorded , and transcribed verbatim . Transcripts were reflexively thematically analysed . A critical friend approach was taken to data coding . Multiple methods of trustworthiness were executed . Results : Runners describe injury on a nine - level continuum , ranging from injury - free to career - ending injury . There are lower and higher levels of injury . Each level of injury is described across four categories of descriptors ; physical description , outcome ( effect on running and daily life ) , psychological description , and management . Conclusion : The Running Injury Continuum is a tool that can be used for injury surveillance ( for healthcare professionals and researchers ) and for research investigating RRI risk factors . Healthcare professionals , researchers and coaches must ensure they monitor the development of all levels of RRIs , across all categories of descriptors . Runners need to be educated regarding appropriate self - management strategies for lower level injuries , with access to evidence - based information being a critical management tool .

Introduction Despite recreational running being an extremely popular physical activity and sport ( 1 – 3 ) , it is associated with high rates of injury ( 4 , 5 ) , with prevalence rates as high as 66 % ( 6 ) . The vast majority of running - related injuries ( RRIs ) are overuse injuries ( 7 ) which occur when excessive , repetitive loads are applied to tissues beyond their adaptive capability ( 8 – 10 ) . While RRIs develop from the interaction between multiple risk factors ( 8 , 11 , 12 ) , there is little consensus on what these risk factors are ( 13 , 14 ) . This is potentially due to a commonly employed approach that uses definitions of injury that are limited , focusing on injuries causing time - loss , rather than capturing the process of injury development ( 15 – 17 ) . Clearly , a critical step in understanding and ultimately preventing RRIs is appropriately defining a RRI . Traditionally , time - loss from activity has been the main criterion for defining overuse injuries , with the duration of time - loss determining severity ( 18 ) . The current consensus definition of a RRI expands on this definition to also include training restriction or the need for medical attention as criteria ( 19 ) . Although this approach broadens the scope of a RRI , it may not represent the full process of injury development , failing to capture the lower levels of injury that many athletes continue to train through ( 18 ) . It has been acknowledged that lower levels of injury exist prior to those that cause time - loss , as evident from : ( i ) a general physiological perspective as represented in the Well - Being Continuum ( 20 ) , ( ii ) a general sports perspective through the development of the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Centre Overuse Injury Questionnaire ( OSTRC - Q ) ( 18 , 21 ) , and ( iii ) directly from capturing runners’ perceptions of RRIs through the Injury Pathway model ( 22 ) .

Only five studies appear to have reported on runners ' perception of the process of injury development ( 22 – 26 ) , with just two studies alluding to runners’ perception of lower levels of injury ( 22 , 25 ) . These studies reported that RRIs are perceived as progressive , with injury ‘categories’ suggested in one , although not described further ( 25 ) , and the identification of a ‘complaint’ level in the process of injury development ( prior to time - loss , training restriction or seeking medical attention ) ( 22 ) . However , it is unclear if this ‘complaint’ level of injury is a single level , or if it comprises multiple unique levels of injury . Therefore , a greater understanding of this process of injury development ( i . e . , runners’ description and management of each level of this process ) is clearly needed if researchers and clinicians are to better understand the gradual and multifactorial nature of RRIs , their risk factors , and ultimate prevention . It is also important for future research aiming to identify RRI risk factors to understand how lower levels of injury may interact with other risk factors to develop into a significant injury ( i . e . , as per the consensus definition ( 19 ) ) ( 20 ) , or indeed , how these lower levels of injury may themselves be risk factors for injury ( 20 ) . An example of such a scenario may be as follows ( Fig 1 ) . At the time of a runner’s initial biomechanical assessment , they are observed to land with a highly extended knee . Subsequently , this results in a lower level injury ( ‘complaint’ ) in their knee ; however , they then go on to develop a significant injury in their Achilles tendon . Without having the knowledge of the lower level injury at the knee , the researcher / clinician may have concluded that the extended knee was directly causative of the Achilles injury , and therefore falsely identify it as a risk factor for Achilles tendon injuries . In reality , the lower level injury at the knee may have resulted in the runner changing their running technique ( e . g . adopting a more forefoot running technique to reduce loading on the knee ) which placed greater loading on the Achilles tendon ( 27 , 28 ) , leading to injury .

In addition , with the dynamic relationship between multiple risk factors and the onset of injury , it is also important to understand how runners react to this process of injury development ( i . e . a lower level injury ) , and how they manage all levels of injury . This may not only help to differentiate between various levels of injury , but also provide insight into how these levels act as potential risk factors themselves for further injury ( 23 , 25 ) . Not considering these lower levels of injury could potentially mask important information that is relevant in identifying risk factors for injury . Therefore , the aim of the present study was to explore recreational runners’ description of injury , and their management of the process of injury development .

Phenomenology was deemed a suitable methodological approach as it focuses on the lived experiences of humans , eliciting insightful accounts of individuals’ subjective experiences regarding a certain topic ( 33 , 34 ) . Although previously thought to be unsuitable in phenomenological research ( 35 , 36 ) , focus groups can provide greater understanding of the phenomenon of interest ( 37 ) as a well - facilitated focus group can produce greater spontaneity , curiosity , and openness to new perspectives on familiar experiences ( 37 – 39 ) . Interpretative phenomenology suggests that researchers cannot completely remove themselves from the studied phenomenon ( 40 ) and considering how their own biases may affect their interpretation ( 41 ) , researchers should aim to explain the lived experiences of participants , rather than solely convey them ( 41 , 42 ) . A semi - structured focus group schedule was developed during several brainstorming meetings between researchers ( AL , EW , SOK , and KM [ Supplementary material A ] ) . Question content , sequencing , phrasing and timing were discussed during meetings . The schedule was tested on colleagues to determine its appropriateness , and then used in the pilot study ( details below ) . Ethical approval was granted by the local university’s Ethics Committee . The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research was adhered to ( 43 ) ( Supplementary material B ) . 3 . 2 Participants A purposive sample of 31 adult recreational runners were recruited . Between April and June 2022 local running clubs were contacted via email or telephone and asked to distribute research information and contact details of researchers to potential participants .

Eligible participants were recreational runners ( someone running at least once per week for the previous six months ( 44 ) ) , aged 18 years or older , and had no previous education or training in musculoskeletal injuries ( e . g . , Athletic Therapist or Physiotherapist ) . All participants reported previously experiencing a lower level injury . 3 . 3 Pilot study A pilot study was conducted to test the focus group schedule and develop an ‘order of themes’ document ( used to organise the coding of focus groups [ Supplementary material C ] ) . Five male and five female participants were recruited as a convenience sample , aged 23 . 8 ± 5 . 9 years . Two focus groups were moderated by two researchers ( AL and SOK ) , each taking place in - person , on University grounds , and lasted 59 . 7 ± 5 . 6 minutes . Focus groups were audio and video recorded , and transcribed verbatim . 3 . 4 Main study procedures Data was collected between April and June 2022 . Participants were organised into groups based on their availability to attend , running background and age . Seven focus groups were moderated by two researchers ( AL and SOK ) and lasted 83 . 9 ± 18 . 1 minutes . On arrival to each focus group , participants were introduced to one another by the moderators , and a casual conversation ( not recorded ) took place prior to starting . Authors ( AL and SOK ) had access to participants’ identifying information during data collection . Participants provided informed consent before commencing . Each focus group began with a brief introduction and the aims of the study were outlined ( Supplementary material A ) . Participants were encouraged to speak freely , ask each other questions , and were given the opportunity to ask the moderators questions at any point . Firstly , participants were asked how they would define All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Participants were prompted to elaborate on their descriptions and asked to draw ( as a group ) their description of RRIs on a whiteboard ( approx . 45 minutes of discussion ) . They were then asked how they manage RRIs , and asked to insert these descriptions on their drawing ( approx . 30 mins ) . Conversation pursued naturally , not being led by the moderators , but with the moderators prompting participants to give as much detail as possible . Participants were asked to complete a short individual questionnaire gathering demographic information , training practices , and injury history . Additionally on this questionnaire , participants were asked to draw their individual perception of how a RRI progresses ( approx . 5 mins ) . On closing the focus groups , participants were given another opportunity to ask questions or provide additional information . The progressive nature of RRIs was not described to participants , nor was the concept of levels of injuries . A reflective and iterative approach was taken to focus groups moderation . Following each focus group , moderators discussed their perception of each focus group , expressed their opinions on the appropriateness of the focus group schedule , and discussed how they could potentially improve for the next group . During the main data collection phase , both moderators included additional probes to encourage further explanation of some points raised and to encourage all participants to share their perceptions . 3 . 5 Data analysis Frequencies and descriptive statistics were generated from the questionnaire responses using SPSS ( IBM Corporation ; version 27 ) and all participants were given an identification number and coded by self - identified gender ( e . g . , male 4 = M4 , female 2 = F2 ) in order to maintain anonymity . All focus groups were audio and video recorded . Audio recordings were sent to an external transcription service to be transcribed verbatim . On their All rights reserved .

The transcribed focus groups were coded by the primary author using NVivo ( QSR International ; release 1 . 6 . 2 ) ( Fig 2 ) . A reflexive thematic analysis approach was taken to data analysis according to Braun and Clarke’s principles ( 45 , 46 ) . This process followed six recursive phases : ( i ) the primary author familiarised herself with the data by reading the transcripts , correcting discrepancies , adding nuance , and re - reading the transcripts , ( ii ) brief labels ( codes ) were generated to identify important aspects of the data , ( iii ) themes were generated through examining and organizing the codes , ( iv ) themes were then reviewed against the whole dataset , and developed further , ( v ) developed themes were then refined , defined and named , and ( vi ) the data were organised into a written report ( 45 , 46 ) . An ‘order of themes’ document was developed during the pilot phase , and was reflexively updated based on the developing , merging and expanding themes and sub - themes in order to organise the codes , sub - themes , themes and core categories ( Supplementary material C ) . Additionally , as a level of data triangulation , the primary author reviewed each group’s whiteboard drawing alongside the corresponding transcript and video recording . Further detail from the transcript was added to each drawing , which clarified these visual representations and ensured consistency between transcripts and drawings . All seven drawings were combined to develop the final nine - point continuum . The final Running Injury Continuum was arrived at based on how participants described each level and where they placed each level . Constant comparative analysis took place , beginning after transcription of the first focus group and continued throughout data collection ( 47 ) . A similar sample size has been used in previous research and allowed for the collection of a rich description from participants regarding RRIs ( 48 , 49 ) . All rights reserved .

To further enhance the analytical process ( 50 ) and to ensure reliability and rigour of results presented ( 51 ) , a critical friend approach was taken between researchers . The critical friend approach encourages reflexivity in the co - construction of knowledge ( 51 , 52 ) , and facilitates the exploration of multiple interpretations of the data , reducing the potential for researcher bias ( 50 , 53 ) . Firstly , researchers ( AL and SOK ) met on multiple occasions to reflexively discuss and review the ‘order of themes’ document . After all focus groups had been coded by the primary author , a percentage ( approximately 30 % ) of the transcripts were coded by another experienced qualitative researcher ( SOK ) , using the ‘order of themes’ document as a guide . Taking a critical friends approach again , researchers ( AL and SOK ) met on multiple occasions to discuss their interpretations of the transcripts , challenging each other ' s interpretations of the data . Codes , sub - themes , themes and core categories were critically reviewed and discussed . The process facilitated the development of additional codes , while some existing sub - themes were merged / expanded . All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Researchers ( AL , SOK , EW and KM ) met on several occasions throughout the data collection and analysis phases to review the coding of the data and discuss individual interpretations . On finishing data collection and analysis , a wider group of researchers ( AL , EW , SOK , SOC , AB and KM ) met to discuss their interpretations of the findings . Multiple interpretations of the data were presented and discussed during meetings , coding was further refined , and a consensus on the final report was reached . Additionally , all individual transcripts and whiteboard drawings were returned to participants within four weeks of their focus group , giving participants the opportunity to alter their individual dialogue and / or group drawing . We also ensured that each participant was satisfied with our interpretation of their discussion . No requests were received to alter group drawings or individual dialogue . Furthermore , multiple examples of direct quotations from participants are presented , enhancing the accuracy and trustworthiness of findings . A broad and diverse contribution from participants is also included , reducing the likelihood of individual bias ( 54 ) . 4 . Results 4 . 1 Demographics Seven focus groups were conducted with 18 ( 58 % ) female and 13 ( 42 % ) male recreational runners . Participants were aged 39 . 7 ± 12 . 7 years ( range 20 - 65 years ) . The majority of runners had been running for more than 5 years ( n = 17 , 55 % ) , fewer running 1 - 3 years ( n = 10 , 32 % ) , and the least amount running 4 - 5 years ( n = 4 , 13 % ) . Participants trained either 2 - 3 times per week ( n = 16 , 52 % ) or 4 - 6 times per week ( n = 15 , 48 % ) , with the majority of runners participating in organised running events ( n = 27 , 87 % ) .

Injury prevention was ‘very’ or ‘extremely’ important to the majority of runners ( n = 21 , 68 % ) , with fewer stating that it was ‘slightly’ or ‘moderately’ important ( n = 9 , 29 % ) , and just one participant reporting it was ‘not at all’ important ( n = 1 , 3 % ) . Further details on training practices are detailed in Table 1 . According to the consensus definition of injury ( 19 ) , most runners reported having a previous RRI ( n = 27 , 87 % ) , while few reported never having a RRI ( n = 4 , 13 % ) . Nineteen participants had at least one RRI in the previous 12 months ( n = 19 , 70 % ) . Further details on RRI history are detailed in Table 1 .

The nine levels of RRI identified were : ‘running smooth’ ( no injury ) , ‘discomfort’ , ‘niggle’ , ‘twinge’ , ‘persisting niggle’ , ‘non - responding niggle’ , ‘injury : short - term effect’ , ‘injury : long - term effect’ , and ‘career - ending injury’ . Runners described each level of the Running Injury Continuum in terms of four key categories of descriptors : physical description , outcome ( effect on running and effect on daily life ) , psychological description and management ( Fig 4 ) .

Runners did not describe a negative physical complaint , a 6 negative outcome , or a negative psychological reaction with this level . 7 In relation to managing this first level , some participants suggested they would 8 complete injury prevention exercises because they “don’t want injury to happen” ( F11 ) , so 9 they “try to prevent it by doing [ their ] stretching” ( F11 ) . However , some runners also 10 suggested that no management strategies would be taken at this level , suggesting that they 11 would be “complacent” ( F10 ) when injury free , and they would “wait for something to 12 happen and then treat it” ( F10 ) , being “reactive rather than proactive” ( F10 ) to injury 13 management . 14 15 4 . 3 . 2 Discomfort 16 ‘Discomfort’ was described with terms and phrases such as “tightness” ( F17 ) , 17 “tiredness” ( M3 ) , “a little bit of pain” ( F6 ) , and “stiffness” ( F3 ) . Many participants also 18 suggested that this level could be associated with previous training ( i . e . , delayed onset muscle 19 soreness [ DOMS ] ) and “being tired from running the previous day” ( M3 ) . They described it 20 as something “temporary” ( M8 ) and that they “know that [ it ] will go away” ( F16 ) ; 21 22 “I think discomfort is fairly mild , no injury . Discomfort is something that is there . It 23 isn’t going to stop you… You could have discomfort on one run and go out two days 24 later and it is gone” ( F11 ) 25 26 All rights reserved .

Like your quads after a speed session” ( F18 ) . However , some 30 runners described this level as a “precursor to injury” ( M1 ) and suggested that further injury 31 can develop from this level because “ you have planted the little injury seed… the injury is on 32 its way” ( M4 ) . With regard to the outcome , this level was not suggested to cause a negative 33 effect on running , with participants suggesting that “you’d definitely run” ( F6 ) and complete 34 full training at this level ; “you don’t back off your mileage because you are tight” ( F15 ) . 35 Additionally , this level did not have a negative effect on a runner’s daily life , however , some 36 runners associated this level with ‘mental fatigue’ and described how they “don’t feel 37 mentally strong” at this level ( M3 ) . 38 The majority of runners take no management strategies at this level because “ you 39 know you will recover in half a day , in two days , three days” ( M8 ) and continuing training is 40 the best management strategy ; “for the stiffness one , the treatment of that one probably 41 would be to go for a run… to loosen it out” ( F3 ) . Some participants however described using 42 self - management strategies such as stretching at this level ; “it will remind me to do the 43 stretching that I know I should be doing anyway” ( M1 ) . Additionally , some runners may look 44 to external sources such as YouTube for appropriate stretches / exercises ; “I find myself 45 YouTubing quite a lot . If I have a pain in my calf , I just do a five minute exercise that I find 46 on YouTube and it will be gone that day” ( M7 ) , or casually chat to their running friends about 47 the complaint : “but only by the by , if it came up in conversation I might mention it” ( F10 ) . 48 49 4 . 3 . 3 Niggle 50 All rights reserved .

In its mildest form , some runners physically described a ‘niggle’ as 52 being more “aware” ( M13 ) or “ conscious” ( F8 ) of a certain body part , describing it as “not 53 [ being ] the same as the other side [ of the body ] ” ( M1 ) , or suggested it is “background noise” 54 ( F10 ) . Other runners described a ‘niggle’ as something slightly more severe , with phrases 55 such as “background pain” ( F15 ) , and “a pain that shouldn’t be there” ( M4 ) . The majority 56 of participants described a ‘niggle’ as something “repeated” ( F8 ) , “persistent” ( F3 ) and 57 “something that lingers” ( F11 ) : “ discomfort can come and go , whereas a niggle is sort of 58 always there ” ( F10 ) . In relation to the outcome , the majority of participants continue full 59 training with a ‘niggle’ , with the perception that runners are “quite high functioning with a 60 niggle” ( F17 ) . Many runners described a ‘niggle’ as “not bad enough” ( F7 ) to stop training , 61 and suggested that they can “cope with a niggle” ( F11 ) , “ignore it a lot of the time” ( F13 ) , or 62 they can “run through it” ( F18 ) . Some also described how they feel pressure to continue 63 training with a ‘niggle’ , whether it is due to running with a group : “if I am with a group I am 64 like ‘oh I need to keep going’ , but I’d probably be making it worse” ( F11 ) , or whether it’s a 65 personal desire to continue : 66 67 “you are chasing the high , chasing the endorphins . When you just get that niggle… 68 you really just keep pushing yourself… And then because it is not an external thing , you can ' t 69 see it , you can just kind of ignore it” ( F13 ) 70 71 However , this level of injury can begin to affect running for some runners , causing 72 them to “start reducing [ their ] mileage because the niggle has hit” ( F17 ) , or to complete a 73 more vigorous warm up because they feel “I should warm up properly if I have a niggle” 74 ( F17 ) .

However , some runners use self - management strategies and 80 alter their training at this level , describing how “niggles encourage me to stretch” ( F15 ) . 81 Some may also “take a day or two off” ( F15 ) or reduce their training load , “not run as far” 82 ( F2 ) , or “slow down” ( F5 ) . Some may also use additional therapeutic modalities such as 83 foam rolling at this level ; “You know that roller that is over in the corner of the front room 84 that you occasionally use , that is when you use it” ( M3 ) . Some participants described that 85 they would also turn towards external management strategies , such as online resources or 86 asking their running friends for advice or support ; “it might come from an external source… 87 somebody says , ‘maybe you should have that looked at’ . . . if you complained about it enough 88 to somebody else , rather than deciding yourself” ( F9 ) . 89 As well as describing a ‘niggle’ in terms of its physical and psychological 90 descriptions , its outcome , and management , many participants reported that ‘niggles’ are 91 “inevitably a fact of running” ( F6 ) , that “runners constantly have niggles” ( F16 ) and they 92 live in “Niggle City” ( F17 ) . Many participants did not perceive a ‘niggle’ to be an ‘injury’ , 93 but described that it can contribute to the development of an ‘injury’ ; F16 - “it could turn into 94 an injury , but I wouldn’t consider it an injury” . Many participants reported that they perceive 95 ‘niggles’ to be an “early warning sign” ( M11 ) , a “potential injury” ( M13 ) , or the “root to an 96 injury” ( F17 ) . 97 98 4 . 3 . 4 Twinge 99 All rights reserved .

However , a twinge was 102 described as something temporary , short - lived , and typically a once - off ; “by the time it 103 happens , it is gone” ( F3 ) . Runners described that it would not be felt during the next session , 104 and they would “forget about it” ( M7 ) . There was no description of an effect on a runner’s 105 daily life , but participants described “caution” ( F7 ) at this level . 106 In relation to management , all runners use some sort of self - management strategy by 107 this level ; “if I had a darting pain I would do something . I wouldn ' t just keep on running with 108 that one” ( F4 ) . Some runners described that “stretching would come in here” ( M11 ) , they 109 would “stop and walk” ( F3 ) , or do “slower runs” ( F7 ) at the onset of a ‘twinge’ . Some 110 participants also suggested they would continue to consult friends , asking “what do you 111 think ? What would you do ? ” ( M9 ) , and online resources “you would definitely Google it” 112 ( M9 ) . 113 114 4 . 3 . 5 Persisting niggle 115 A ‘persisting niggle’ was described as a progression of a ‘niggle’ , however , it differs 116 because it was described as more severe and more persistent . Progressing from milder terms 117 ( such as tightness or tiredness ) used to describe a ‘ niggle’ , a ‘persisting niggle’ was 118 associated with a description of pain , with “low - medium” ( F2 ) pain and “mild pain” ( F12 ) 119 being suggested . It was also described as “persistent” ( M5 ) and as occurring on “consistent 120 occasions , consistent runs” ( F4 ) . 121 122 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

If it 123 happens again the next week , and the next week , it doesn ' t become a niggle anymore , it 124 becomes a problem where you know it is not going to go away” ( M7 ) 125 126 In relation to the outcome , some runners will continue to train fully at this level 127 because “it is tolerable to keep running” ( F6 ) and they want to “ take a chance” ( M7 ) and 128 hope that it will not progress to a further level . However , the majority of runners will change 129 their training at this level by “ decreasing [ their ] load” and “hopefully [ going ] back to no 130 injury” ( F9 ) . Some runners may also take additional rest days ; “I might stop and take a little 131 bit of a rest , but be back at it . The pain wouldn ' t need to go . It would just need to be a bit 132 better and then I would go again” ( F4 ) . There was still no description of this level affecting a 133 runner’s daily life , however , in relation to the psychological description , this level inspired 134 the first mention of associated concern and “anxiety” ( F7 ) . 135 With regard to management , self - management strategies progress from previous 136 levels with further alterations to training being made . Some runners will “decrease [ their ] 137 load” ( F9 ) because they “can’t go full tilt” ( F2 ) , while others will “take a break for a few 138 days” ( F3 ) . As external strategies , there is a continuation of consulting friends and getting 139 “peer advice” ( F6 ) , as well as using the internet : “using Google because it’s the go - to” 140 ( M9 ) . This level is associated with the first mention of obtaining medical professional 141 attention from an Athletic Therapist / Physiotherapist . Some participants described that they 142 would be “looking for physio support” ( F2 ) because they “probably should go and get it 143 looked at” ( F2 ) . 144 145 4 . 3 . 6 Non - responding niggle 146 All rights reserved .

Participants described how it is more evident that they need to 149 make a decision at this level of whether they continue running ( with altered training ) , stop 150 running ( for an unknown period of time ) , or seek external medical attention . 151 Physically , this level was described as causing “more intense” ( F15 ) pain that is 152 “getting worse” ( F16 ) and is increasingly persistent to the point of being “constant” ( F16 ) . It 153 was described as pain that “doesn’t stop” ( F4 ) despite management attempts being made . In 154 relation to the outcome , some runners will continue training , although with a reduced training 155 load , because they are “ not prepared to leave seriously” ( M3 ) . Furthermore , some runners 156 normalised running with this level of injury and suggested that “everybody runs with an 157 injury… I have never met anybody who didn’t run with an injury” ( M9 ) . However , others 158 suggested that they “shouldn’t be running” ( F3 ) at this level , and that they will stop training 159 in the short - term : “middle of the road to me is where we are going to rest for a week” ( M9 ) . 160 This level was the first mention of a negative effect on a runner’s daily life , with description 161 of “pain filter [ ing ] through the rest of your day” ( F9 ) and pain being present “as you’re 162 walking around” ( F18 ) . Participants suggested that they will begin to make conscious 163 decisions and efforts to protect this level of injury ; “ I might choose to bring the dog to a field 164 and throw a stick and let him run , rather than me having to walk the 4km with him” ( F15 ) . 165 With regard to a psychological description , runners would become increasingly anxious at 166 this level , thinking “do I need to worry here ? ” ( F16 ) . 167 In relation to management , some runners continue with self - management strategies by 168 choosing to take a short - term break from training ; “I would rest myself . Ease up for a week 169 and see how it felt” ( M9 ) , while others will seek external advice because these are “the 170 injuries where we run out of ideas of how to treat it [ ourselves ] ” ( M3 ) and they are at “the 171 All rights reserved .

Some participants also described how they would still 172 consult their running friends or “someone who has a lot of running knowledge” ( M7 ) for 173 advice or support . 174 175 4 . 3 . 7 Injury : short - term effect 176 An ‘injury : short - term effect’ was described as causing “severe discomfort” ( M6 ) , 177 “dull pain” ( F12 ) , and “really sharp pain” ( M10 ) . It was described as causing runners 178 “constant pain” ( F12 ) if they continue to run , and getting progressively worse ; “I’ll keep 179 going and make it worse until I have to stop” ( M13 ) . Additionally , some runners perceived 180 that this level would cause a physical sign or a “visible effect” ( F6 ) of an injury , such as 181 limping or swelling . In relation to the outcome , this level will cause a “short - term stoppage” 182 ( F6 ) to running ( i . e . , days / weeks ) for the majority of runners , and was referred to as a 183 “stopping injury” ( M13 ) where they cannot continue to train . It will also continue to affect a 184 runners’ daily life , with “pain outside of running , pain in work” ( F12 ) and having an effect 185 on decisions such as “taking the car instead of walking somewhere” ( F7 ) . Runners are also 186 becoming increasingly anxious at this level and describe that an injury which “stops you 187 running… really messes with your head” ( M7 ) . 188 As well as being described as a progression along the Running Injury Continuum , 189 some participants described this level of injury as one which has an acute onset ( e . g . , muscle 190 strain or joint sprain ) , causing a short - term stoppage to running ( i . e . , for a number of weeks ) ; 191 “a sudden injury where you just have to come to a standstill” ( F5 ) . At this level , external 192 management strategies take over as the primary method of management , with participants 193 describing that they “need some sort of intervention” ( M6 ) . Participants suggested that 194 Athletic Therapists / Physiotherapists are their primary sources of medical intervention , and 195 they feel they “ have to go to physio now because it is not going away” ( M11 ) .

At this level , all runners have stopped 203 running in the long - term ( i . e . , months or longer ) because they are unable to run and describe 204 being “out of action for a few months” ( M3 ) . Similar to the previous level , runners’ daily 205 lives are affected and conscious decisions are made to offload the injured area . As a 206 psychological description , runners are increasingly anxious and becoming frustrated ; “the 207 injury is about the frustration of not being able to do what you want to do” ( M9 ) . 208 By this level , all participants are using external management strategies , with runners 209 turning towards interventions from medical specialists or “the correct doctor” ( M6 ) . Some 210 will continue to consult an Athletic Therapist / Physiotherapist to dictate the most appropriate 211 course of action , however , runners described that this level needs specialist intervention ; 212 213 “When I have gone to the physio four times , five times , and the physio says ‘look , 214 what I have done should have helped it , it is not helping it , so there is obviously something 215 else wrong here , so my advice is you need to get referred to a consultant’” ( M11 ) . 216 217 4 . 3 . 9 Career - ending injury 218 With a ‘career - ending injury’ , there is less attention on the physical description , 219 although severe pain and “the worst possible pain you could imagine” ( F6 ) was suggested , 220 and more significance to the outcome .

Some suggested that this 222 level would significantly affect their daily life where “you can ' t do ordinary stuff , even in 223 your household duties” ( M5 ) , with associated feelings of frustration and depression regarding 224 their injury . 225 Some runners described using external management strategies as final attempts to 226 manage this level of injury , with “need [ ing ] surgery” ( F4 ) being suggested as a potential 227 strategy . However , as the worst possible injury suggested by runners , it was described that 228 they would never run again . 229 230 4 . 4 Individual perception 231 It is important to note that many participants suggested that runners’ description of 232 injury and their management of the process of injury development is “not the same for 233 everyone” ( M8 ) and “there are a whole host of external factors that inform your perception 234 of it” ( F10 ) . Such factors include their running habits and history , individual factors , and 235 injury - related factors ( Supplementary material C ) . 236 With regard to running habits and history , some participants suggested that 237 description and management of injury is “based on your experience” ( M9 ) and “the length of 238 time people are running , or the experience [ they ] have with injury” ( F17 ) . Participants 239 suggested that more experienced runners will have a better understanding of the levels of 240 injury , and manage these levels more appropriately : “newbie runners… they don’t know what 241 a niggle is” ( M2 ) . Additionally , participants described how a runner’s “motivational factors” 242 ( F9 ) influence their management of the process of injury development : “it boils down to what 243 your objectives are” ( M10 ) . Runners suggested that those who are more competitive or those 244 training for a specific goal will continue training with a lower level injury , rather than 245 reducing their load because “sometimes the benefits just outweigh the risks” ( F12 ) . 246 All rights reserved .

Some participants also 249 discussed how a runner’s daily life can influence their description and management of injury , 250 with factors such as “state of mind” ( F3 ) on a particular day or their menstrual cycle making 251 someone feel “sluggish” ( F6 ) influencing their description and management of injury . 252 Additionally , some female participants suggested that having children to care for will 253 influence their management of injury because they “ can ' t afford to be laid up in a bed” ( F2 ) : 254 255 “the person who doesn ' t have children , or can have all that time to rest before and 256 after the run , they might be more likely to do the run [ while having a lower level injury ] … If 257 you had to come home and you go , ‘right , if I go for a run this morning I will not be able to 258 do the nursery football with the children after school because I will be in pain’” ( F9 ) 259 260 Finally , participants also suggested that injury - related factors , such as previous 261 injuries and “how impacted you have been by injury in the past” ( F11 ) will influence how a 262 runner describes and manages all levels of injury . Participants described that they would 263 “intervene earlier if it is something [ they ] have had before… and go quicker through the 264 [ management ] steps” ( F8 ) , compared to an injury they have never had . 265 266 5 . Discussion 267 This study provides a qualitative insight into how recreational runners describe injury and 268 manage the process of injury development . By capturing the lived experiences of athletes , the 269 authors present a comprehensive representation of RRIs , highlighting their progressive , 270 overuse nature . 271 All rights reserved .

The nine levels are categorised into lower and higher level injuries . Lower 276 level injuries span between ‘discomfort’ to ‘non - responding niggle’ , while higher level 277 injuries , which are most associated with the RRI consensus definition ( 19 ) , span between 278 ‘injury : short - term effect’ to ‘career - ending injury’ . Runners described each level of injury 279 using four categories of descriptors : physical description , outcome ( the effect on running and 280 on daily life ) , psychological description , and management ( self - management , and external 281 management strategies ) . This is a bi - directional continuum , on which runners can progress or 282 regress , either increasing or decreasing in injury severity depending on their management of 283 each level . During injury development ( or recovery ) , runners do not have to progress through 284 the immediate succeeding ( or preceding ) level of injury ( e . g . , runners can progress from a 285 ‘niggle’ straight to a ‘non - responding niggle’ ) . 286 Both end - levels of the continuum ( i . e . , ‘running smooth’ and ‘career - ending injury’ ) 287 were clearly described by participants , with a high level of agreement achieved amongst all 288 participants . However , there was variance in opinion regarding the seven levels in - between , 289 with some overlapping descriptions across adjacent levels . This is captured in the term 290 ‘continuum’ which is “a continuous sequence in which adjacent elements are not always 291 perceptibly different from each other , but the extremes are quite distinct” ( 55 ) . It also reflects 292 runners’ perception of the progressive and regressive nature of RRIs . While the categories of 293 descriptors used to differentiate levels of injury were sometimes not individually unique ( e . g . , 294 caution was used to psychologically describe both ‘niggle’ and ‘twinge’ ) , it was possible to 295 differentiate between levels of injury by comparing across all categories of the descriptors 296 All rights reserved .

The term ‘niggle’ was the most commonly used term to suggest a 298 lower level injury , used by every participant in every focus group . From our findings , a 299 ‘niggle’ can be defined as : ‘a repeated physical sensation ( discomfort or low pain ) with 300 which a runner can continue to run’ . However , the level ‘discomfort’ is the first level of a 301 complaint along the Running Injury Continuum and initiates the progression of lower level 302 injuries . From this complaint of temporary discomfort or tightness , the Running Injury 303 Continuum advances into three distinct levels of progressive and worsening ‘niggles’ : the 304 ‘niggle’ , the ‘persisting niggle’ , and the ‘non - responding niggle’ . These three entities 305 describe levels of injury which become increasingly more severe in terms of their physical 306 description , their outcome ( effect on running and daily life ) , their psychological description , 307 and the management strategies required . However , amongst these three levels of niggle , there 308 is a further lower level injury that does not follow this progressive nature ; the ‘twinge’ . A 309 ‘twinge’ can be defined as : ‘an acute onset of pain resulting in an immediate outcome ( either 310 a reduction in training load within a session , or the stoppage of a training session ) , but 311 which does not persist to the next session’ . 312 The Running Injury Continuum supports previously published representations of 313 overuse injuries . A comparison can be made between our participants’ description of 314 escalating levels of injury severity and the Well - Being Continuum ( 20 ) , which describes the 315 escalating levels of biological and physiological tissue damage associated with overuse injury 316 development . Our findings also support the Injury Pathway which represents runners’ own 317 views on the process of RRI development ( 22 ) . While other papers have implicitly referred to 318 an ‘early phase of injury’ during the injury development process , using phraseology such as 319 “early phase” ( 18 ) , “early symptoms” ( 24 ) and “injury category” ( 25 ) , to the best of our 320 knowledge , only one study has explicitly identified and named a lower level injury during 321 All rights reserved .

However , our study explores 322 this to a greater extent and appears to be the first to explicitly provide sub - categories within 323 this phase . Additionally , with the later phase of injury development , rather than concluding 324 the process of injury development at a single point termed “injury” ( as with the Injury 325 Pathway ( 22 ) ) , we have identified further sub - categories within this later phase ( i . e . , higher 326 level injuries ) which map with the consensus definition ( 19 ) . Furthermore , we provide a rich 327 and in - depth account of runners’ description and management of the process of injury 328 development , in both the early and late phases . 329 The OSTRC Overuse Injury Questionnaire ( OSTRC - O ) is a widely cited tool for 330 surveiling overuse injuries in sport research ( 21 ) . It acknowledges lower level injuries in that 331 it recognises the importance of non - time loss injuries , and does so through monitoring both 332 the characteristics of pain ( physical descriptor ) and effect on running ( outcome ) ( 18 ) . 333 However , our findings build upon the OSTRC - O , indicating the importance of capturing 334 additional categories of descriptors , including the psychological response to injury and the 335 management strategies used , both of which can impact injury development ( 22 , 26 , 56 ) . 336 Additionally , in studies investigating risk factors for injury , it may be beneficial for 337 researchers to determine the specific level of injury ( e . g . niggle ) experienced by athletes , as 338 these lower level injuries have the potential to not only interact with other possible risk 339 factors for injury ( increasing injury risk ) , but also to potentially act as risk factors for injury 340 themselves ( Fig 1 ) . By using regular surveillance and capturing this level of detail , 341 researchers could be provided with significant insight into : the risk factors for RRIs , the 342 development process of RRIs , and understanding how the consequences of injury change 343 during this process . 344 Our findings highlight the importance of the psychological response to injury 345 experienced by runners . It is well accepted that athletes may experience psychological 346 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Specifically , our findings suggest that 349 runners experience a progressive psychological response to injury that increases in severity as 350 the Running Injury Continuum progresses . Our findings support previous research which 351 highlights runners’ experiences of psychosocial distress in response to overuse injuries 352 ( 26 , 60 , 61 ) , with reports of frustration , fear , general psychosocial distress , and social 353 influences experienced by runners during the injury process ( 60 ) . However , in contrast to 354 previous research which identified that these responses occur from injury onset ( defined as 355 the point where runners perceive themselves to be injured , or pain is affecting their running ) 356 ( 61 ) , our findings indicate a psychological response that occurs from an earlier phase during 357 the injury development process . We identified the first description of a negative 358 psychological response to injury at the level of a ‘discomfort’ , where runners describe 359 ‘mental fatigue’ . This level identifies the start of a pathway of worry , concern and anxiety 360 experienced by runners during the injury development process . The capture of runners’ 361 description of anxiety during these lower level injuries is a novel finding as , to the best of the 362 authors’ knowledge , previous research has not reported such an extreme psychological 363 response at such an early phase of injury development . It is crucial that clinicians , coaches , 364 runners and other personnel involved with runners’ well - being are aware of this finding and 365 understand the level of psychological distress experienced by runners , especially during the 366 early phases of injury development . 367 368 5 . 2 Management 369 Our results support previous research which identified runners’ desire for autonomy 370 in the dealing with lower level injuries by predominantly using self - management strategies , 371 All rights reserved .

Typical self - management 373 strategies involve reductions in training load and using therapies such as ice , stretching or 374 general rehabilitation exercises to prevent or slow the progression of their lower level injury , 375 while maintaining some level of training . Our findings also agree with previous research 376 which reports runners’ reliance on non - evidence based sources of information ( such as web - 377 based or peer advice and previous personal experience ) to inform self - management of their 378 lower level injuries ( 22 , 26 , 60 , 62 ) , as well as their reluctance to attend healthcare 379 professionals ( HCPs ) , despite experiencing physical and psychosocial distress ( 60 ) . 380 Participants suggested several reasons for not attending a HCP . Firstly , lower level injuries 381 are not severe enough to warrant HCP input . Secondly , some runners described wishful 382 thinking regarding their lower level injury , hoping that it will resolve on its own without the 383 need for HCP intervention . Wishful thinking is a bias pervading the management of persistent 384 musculoskeletal pain , where decisions and beliefs regarding an injury are based on what is 385 pleasing to imagine , rather than based on evidence , rationality or reality ( 63 ) . Finally , runners 386 suggested that their previous experience with injury removes the need to attend a HCP . This 387 finding is similar to previous research in which runners have reported that those with more 388 running experience are better able to self - manage RRIs ( 22 , 26 ) . It has also been suggested 389 that novice runners are more at risk for RRIs ( 64 ) , while coaching or education ( i . e . , 390 increasing runners ' understanding of the injury development process ) is theorised to enhance 391 injury prevention ( 65 ) . 392 The decision to seek HCP advice most often came at the level of ‘injury : short - term 393 effect’ , and from this point on , as the injury becomes more severe or impactful , HCP advice 394 becomes more specialised . Runners described several reasons for seeking HCP advice . 395 Firstly , when their attempts to self - manage injury had failed , or their injury had become too 396 All rights reserved .

Secondly , they would attend a HCP because they are seeking validation of their injury , 398 typically in one of two ways . Runners are either seeking confirmation that they are actually 399 injured and the injury is not in their head ( as often , there are no physical signs of injury and 400 they may be able to continue training ) ; or they are looking for reassurance that their injury is 401 not as serious as they may be concerned about , and they are seeking guidance on continuing 402 their training . 403 404 5 . 3 Implications 405 Our findings have several implications for HCPs , coaches and researchers . 406 407 5 . 1 . 1 Education 408 It is clear that the education of runners regarding evidence - based information on 409 managing and preventing RRIs is required . Firstly , HCPs should be aware that runners 410 typically do not attend an HCP with a lower level injury because they believe they can be 411 primarily self - managed . While this is a positive finding in the sense that runners feel 412 empowered to self - manage their own lower level injuries , it is also clear that HCPs need to 413 educate their patients on appropriate self - management strategies , by directing them towards 414 trustworthy sources of information , ensuring runners are using evidence - based 415 recommendations to prevent and rehabilitate injury . Similarly , coaches , running clubs , and 416 governing bodies need to educate runners , encouraging them to use evidence - based practices 417 in the management of their injuries ( e . g . , Athletic Therapists / Physiotherapists , evidence - 418 based sources of information ) . Secondly , there is a need for enhanced dissemination of 419 evidence - based information to runners . Researchers need to ensure their findings are freely 420 All rights reserved .

Firstly , HCPs should 426 consider the potential importance of lower level injuries acting as risk factors for higher level 427 injuries ( as discussed above ) , and appreciate that a runner presenting with a higher level 428 injury may have had a preceding lower level injury , in order to better manage the whole 429 continuum of injury . Secondly , when designing injury management strategies , HCPs should 430 understand that runners will likely have made attempts to self - manage their injury prior to 431 presenting to them , and these attempts should be taken into consideration . Finally , with the 432 emphasis placed by participants in the current study on the psychological description of each 433 level of injury , it is crucial that HCP’s include biopsychosocial assessments when dealing 434 with recreational runners , ensuring this psychological response is captured , monitored and 435 incorporated into management strategies . HCPs should also educate their patients regarding 436 the psychological aspect of the process of injury development , and ensure patients understand 437 that it is normal to experience these responses ( i . e . to experience anxiety or concern , 438 especially with a lower level injury ) ( 60 ) . Similarly , in helping athletes manage injuries , 439 coaches need to be aware of the importance of not only monitoring all levels of injury and 440 supporting athletes with appropriate management strategies , but also on monitoring athletes 441 across all categories of descriptors . 442 Future research should also broaden its scope of investigating RRIs ( and overuse 443 injuries ) to ensure that all categories of descriptors are captured in order to better understand 444 the wider impact of an injury . In particular , this will allow examination of whether lower 445 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Strengths and Limitations 449 A representative sample was included in the current study , gathering the perceptions of 450 runners of various ages and running backgrounds . We included a larger sample size of 451 runners compared to previous research ( 22 , 26 ) , enhancing the reliability of our findings . We 452 employed a method of constant comparative analysis throughout the data collection and 453 analysis phases , enhancing the methodological rigour . Multiple coders with different research 454 and lifestyle backgrounds were involved , reducing the potential of researcher bias . 455 Furthermore , several methods of trustworthiness were executed to ensure appropriate 456 interpretation of findings and enhance the credibility of results . 457 The study’s findings should also be considered in light of some limitations . Our 458 sample consisted of only Irish runners , therefore these findings may not be representative of 459 the global population of runners . In particular , specific terminology used ( e . g . niggle ) or 460 methods of management employed ( e . g . , access to clinicians ) may not be consistent across 461 other nationalities or socio - demographics . Furthermore , as we only recruited recreational 462 runners , findings may differ with elite or novice runners . As the aim of this study was to 463 explore the lived experience of runners , it was necessary for participants to have previous 464 experience with lower level injuries ; however , it is possible that different findings would be 465 reported from runners with less / no experience of lower level injuries . Given the adopted 466 terminology of ‘niggle’ , ‘persisting niggle’ and ‘non - responding niggle’ , a ‘twinge’ can be 467 viewed as a distinct level from these because of its associated sharp pain , its immediate effect 468 on running , and its presence for only one session . The location of ‘twinge’ between ‘niggle’ 469 and ‘persisting niggle’ or ‘persisting niggle’ and ‘non - responding niggle’ was not consistent 470 All rights reserved .

Conclusion 475 Through capturing the lived experiences of recreational runners , we present the Running 476 Injury Continuum as a representation of the development process of RRIs . Expanding on 477 previous research ( 22 – 26 ) , nine distinct levels of injury were identified in the current study , 478 with each level being described across four categories of descriptors : physical description , 479 outcome , psychological description , and management . For research purposes , the Running 480 Injury Continuum is a tool that can be used in both injury surveillance research and research 481 investigating risk factors for RRIs . 482 Our findings clearly highlight the importance of education and accessibility of 483 evidence - based information . HCPs need to educate their patients on appropriate self - 484 management strategies for RRIs , while researchers should ensure recreational runners have 485 access to evidence - based information , and can utilize this information in their running 486 practices . HCPs , coaches and researchers should broaden their scope of monitoring RRIs to 487 ensure that all levels of injury and categories of descriptors are captured , in order to better 488 understand the wider impact of RRIs , to more appropriately manage RRIs , and potentially 489 enhance injury prevention . 490 491 8 .
