Calcium Binding to Calmodulin and Its Globular Domains * ( Received for publication , November 5 , 1990 ) Sara Linse , Anna Helmersson , and Sture Forsen From Physical Chemistry 2 , Lund Uniuersity , Chemical Centre , S - 221 00 Lund , Sweden The macroscopic Ca2 + - binding constants of bovine calmodulin have been determined from titrations with Ca2 + in the presence of the chromophoric chelator 5 , 5’ - Br2BAPTA in 0 , 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 , and 150 mM KC1 . Identical experiments have also been performed for tryptic fragments comprising the N - terminal and C - terminal domains of calmodulin . These measurements indicate that the separated globular domains retain the Ca2 + binding properties that they have in the intact molecule . The Ca2 + affinity is 6 - fold higher for the C - terminal domain than for the N - terminal domain . The salt effect on the free energy of binding two Ca2 + ions is 20 and 21 kJ * mol” for the N - and C - terminal do - main , respectively , comparing 0 and 150 mM KCl . Positive cooperativity of Ca2 + binding is observed within each globular domain at all ionic strengths . No interaction is observed between the globular domains . In the N - terminal domain , the cooperativity amounts to 3 kJ * mol” at low ionic strength and z10 kJ * mol” at 0 . 15 M KCl . For the C - terminal domain , the corre - sponding figures are 9 2 2 kJ * mol” and 210 kJ * mol” . Two - dimensional ‘H NMR studies of the fragments show that potassium binding does not alter the protein conformation . Calmodulin is a regulatory Ca2 + - binding protein which transmits a transiently increased intracellular Ca2 + concen - tration to an activation of specific enzymes . This is possible because of substantial rearrangement of the calmodulin mol - ecule on Ca2 + binding . The crystal form of Ca2 + - loaded cal - modulin ( Babu et al . , 1985 , 1988 ; Kretsinger and Weissman , 1986 ) resembles a dumbbell with two globular domains sepa - rated by a central helix . Small angle x - ray scattering studies ( Heidorn and Trewhella , 1988 ) indicate that calmodulin in solution also folds into two separate globular lobes , which on average are closer together than in the crystal state , owing to flexibility in the interconnecting helix . ‘H NMR studies aim - ing at a high resolution structure of calmodulin in solution have been initiated ( Ikura et al . , 1990 ) . Calmodulin contains four relatively high affinity Ca2 + sites ( K , = 106 - 107 M - ’ at low ionic strength ) which have a helix - loop - helix conformation , so - called EF - hands ( Kretsinger and Nockolds , 1973 ) . Each globular domain contains two such sites , which enables cooperative calcium binding . The sites in the C - terminal domain have higher Ca2 + affinity than those in the N - terminal domain ( Thulin et al . , 1984 ; Wang et al . , 1984 ; Martin et al . , 1985 ) . Because of its biological importance as a regulator of cellular functions , calmodulin has been the * This work was supported by Swedish Natural Science Research Council ( NFR ) Grant K - KU - 2545 - 300 .

Several studies of the Ca2 + - binding properties of calmodu - lin , at different conditions as regards choice of buffer and ionic strength , have been reported to date ( see for example Dedman et al . , 1977 ; Jarret and Kyte , 1979 ; Crouch and Klee , 1980 ; Cox et al . , 1981 ; Haiech et al . , 1981 ; Keller et al . , 1982 ; Yoshida et al . , 1983 ; Ogawa and Tanokura , 1984 ; Burger et al . , 1984 ; Iida and Potter , 1986 ; for recent reviews see Forsen et al . , 1986 and Cox et al . , 1988 ) . Some of these studies are apparently contradictory and report either four noninteract - ing sites with identical or different Ca2 + affinities or positive cooperativity between at least two sites . Part of the apparent controversy is likely to be due to the different methods of analyzing the primary data ( Forsbn et al . , 1986 ) . In addition , binding data obtained for a system with two slightly different pairs of sites with cooperativity within each pair often closely resembles the data for a system with four equivalent and noninteracting sites ( Wang , 1985 ) . Therefore , any method adopted for determining Ca2 + - binding constants of calmodulin must provide accurate measurements of the free Ca2 + concen - tration or a parameter related to this quantity . To take maximum advantage of the accuracy of the chosen method , least squares fitting should be done directly to the measured parameter . In the present work , we show that titrations in which calmodulin competes for calcium with a chromophoric chela - tor ( 5 , 5’ - Br2BAPTA ) ’ can distinguish between cooperative and independent binding . The absorbance of the chelator as a function of total Ca2 + concentration reveals two consecutive processes in calmodulin , each involving cooperative binding of two Ca2 + ions . Studies of tryptic fragments comprising the N - and C - terminal domains help to identify these two proc - esses and indicate that in the intact protein there is no cooperativity between the globular domains . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials - Bovine testes calmodulin and its tryptic fragments were prepared as previously described ( Andersson et al . , 1983 ; Vogel et aL , 1983 ) , and the purity was checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate - gel electrophoresis , agarose gel electrophoresis , and ‘H NMR . The resid - ual Ca2 + content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy or by comparing the difference between the fitted values of AMAX and AMIN ( cj . below ) with those of the same chelator solution containing 250 PM EDTA instead of protein . 5 , 5’ - BrzBAPTA ( Tsien , 1980 ) was from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , Oregon ) . All other chem - icals were of highest purity commercially available . ‘H NMR - ”H NMR spectra were obtained at 500 . 13 MHz on a GE - OMEGA 500 spectrometer , at 27 “C and pH 7 . 5 in HzO . Ca2 + - binding Constants - Each protein ( 20 - 30 + M ) was titrated with Ca2 + in the presence of the tetrapotassium salt of 5 , 5’ - The abbreviations used are : 5 , 5’ - Br2BAPTA , 5 , 5’ - dibromo - 1 , 2 - bis ( 2 - aminophenoxy ) ethane - N , N , N’ , N’ - tetraacetic acid ; TRIG , tryptic fragment comprising residues 1 - 74 of bovine calmodulin ; TR2C , tryptic fragment comprising residues 78 - 148 of bovine cal - modulin ; NH , amide proton ; C”H , proton bound to a - carbon . 8050 Ca2 + Binding to Calmodulin 8051 Br , BAPTA ( 25 - 30 p ~ ) and different concentrations of KC1 , in 2 mM Tris / HCl buffer at pH 7 . 5 and 25 " C as previously described ( Linse et al . , 1987 , 1988 ) . Macroscopic Ca2 + - binding constants were obtained from least squares fits directly to the data , i . e . to the absorbance at 263 nm as a function of total Ca2 + concentration . The analysis was based entirely on concentration . Two macroscopic binding constants ( Kl and K2 ) were used in the case of each fragment and four ( Kl , K , , K , , , and K4 ) in the case of intact calmodulin . Fixed parameters in the fit were KDQ = the Ca2 + dissociation constant of the chelator , CQ ; the chelator concentration at each titration point i , CATOT , = the total Ca2 + concentration at point i , including initial and added Ca2 + , and CP ; = protein concentration ( by weight of lyophilized protein ) at point i . CQ ; , CP , , and CATOT ; include corrections for the dilutions caused by Ca2 + additions . Variable parameters in the fit were Kl through K4 , AMAX , AMIN , and F . AMAX and AMIN are the absorbances one would measure for the initial solution if it was completely Ca2 + - free or contained saturating amounts of Ca " , re - spectively . F is a correction factor that accounts for the fact that the protein concentration obtained by weight is not correct owing to the presence of residual water in the lyophilized protein . In our experi - ence , no currently used method for protein concentration determi - nation provides values that are more accurate than the experimental Ca2 + titration data itself ( in the case of strong Ca2 + binding ) . This validates the use of F as an adjustable parameter ( cf . below ) . For each set of variable parameters , the Newton - Raphson method was used to solve for the free Caz + concentration , Y , at each titration point , i , from the following equation N / b \ F . CP , . ( kYk . fi K , ) CAT0 1 T 1x T , - Y - Y . CQ ; k = l \ j = l 1 - " uDQ = o 1 + ( Y k . h KA \ & - I where N = 4 in the case of intact calmodulin and N = 2 for each fragment . In this equation , the last and next to last terms equal the protein - bound calcium and chelator - bound calcium , respectively . The absorbance of 5 , 5 ' - Br2BAPTA at 263 nm decreases when it binds Ca2 + , and the absorbance at point i can then be calculated as AbSca ~ cu ~ ated . z = [ AMAX - ( AMAX - AMIN ) Y / ( Y + KDQ ) ] CQi / CQl where CQ , is the initial chelator Concentration . Thus , the changes in absorbance at 263 nm were assumed to arise from the chelator only . ( It was experimentally verified that the changes in A263 on calcium addition to 30 NM calmodulin were neglible as compared to 30 p ~ chelator . ) The error square sum , ESS , was obtained by summing over all points in the titration ESS = % AbSca ~ , , lated . ; - AbsmeaSured , ; ) ' The variable parameters were iterated in a separate procedure until an optimal fit ( minimum ESS ) was found . This procedure is based on numerical evaluation of the first and second derivative of ESS with respect to each parameter . The uncertainties in the final values of the parameters were estimated as previously described ( Linse et al . , 1991 ) and do not include errors in the Ca2 + affinities for the chelator , which have been reported for 0 , 50 , 10 , and 150 mM KC1 ( Linse et al . , 1991 ) . Here determined values are KDQ = 1 . 8 . M at 10 mM KCI , and KDQ = 4 . 4 . M at 25 mM KC1 . To make sure our results are not biased by the previously determined stoichiometry of four high affinity sites in calmodulin , the fitting program was forced to use three or five sites , respectively , when analyzing the titration data for intact calmodulin . When all variable parameters ( including the protein concentration ) were allowed to adjust their values , the error square sum of the optimal fit was 10 - fold higher than for the case of four high affinity sites . pH Titrations - pH titrations ( from pH 6 . 5 - 11 ) were performed in 0 and 150 mM KC1 in order to assess any salt effect on the pK . values of ionizable groups which affect the Ca2 + affinity of calmodulin . Each fragment was first dissolved in 2 mM Tris / HCl buffer ( at pH 7 . 5 ) containing 25 p ~ 5 , 5 ' - Br2BAPTA and 0 or 0 . 15 M KC1 . Small portions of Ca ' + were added and followed by measurements of the absorbance at 263 nm ( AzG3 ) , until the system was approximately half - saturated . pH was then adjusted ( with HC1 ) to 6 . 5 , and AZG3 was recorded . The pH was adjusted in steps of ~ 0 . 2 5 by adding small amounts ( 2 - 5 pl ) of NH : I , and was recorded at each step . The measured A , , , was corrected for the dilutions caused by NHB additions and plotted uersus pH . Since reports the Ca2 + saturation level of the chelator , the Ca " affinity of which is constant in the pH interval 6 . 5 - 11 ( Tsien , 1980 ) , the plot gives a qualitative measure of pH effects on the Ca2 + affinity of the protein . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The aim of the present work was to perform a detailed investigation of the Ca2 + affinity and cooperativity of calmod - ulin and its tryptic fragments . Titrations with Ca2 + in the presence of a chromophoric chelator have proven accurate enough to discriminate cooperative binding from independent binding ( Linse et al . , 1987 , 1988 ) . Least squares fits to such titrations provide macroscopic Ca2 + - binding constants , which refer to the binding of the first , second , third , and so on Ca2 + ion to the protein , irrespective of what site is occupied in the protein . Three examples of experimental data with the che - lator 5 , 5 ' - Br , BAPTA ( and intact calmodulin , TRIG , or TR2C , respectively ) are shown in Fig . lA together with the curves of best fit . Fig . 1B displays calculated curves for the chelator and a two - site protein with either two equally strong and noninteracting sites , positive cooperativity , or sequential binding . Evidently , positive cooperativity and sequential binding both result in S - shaped curves , but the curvature is of opposite sign . The trends in the experimental curves in Fig . lA thus indicate cooperative binding . For intact calmod - 00 10 . . . . , . . 00 . . . . . . . 1 . 0 CATOT FIG . 1 .

The data have been normalized such that CATOT = 1 . 0 corresponds to total chelator concentration plus 2 times the protein concentration ( fragments ) or total chelator concentration plus 4 times the total protein concentration ( calmodulin ) . For com - parison , the three curves have been drawn with their respective AMAX and AMIN values at the same level . The actual values for the three titrations shown are : for intact calmodulin AMAX = 0 . 608 and AMIN = 0 . 220 ( 25 . 0 p ~ 5 , 5 ' - Br2BAPTA ) ; for TRIC , 0 . 557 and 0 . 128 ( 27 . 5 p ~ ) ; and for TR2C , 0 . 575 and 0 . 185 ( 25 . 0 p ~ ) .

Fig . 2 shows an analysis of the precision in the different parameters obtained in the least squares fitting to the data for intact calmodulin as displayed in Fig . L4 . This analysis confirms positive cooperativity and that only a narrow range of values of the protein concentration ( F . CPROT1 ) give ac - ceptable fits to the experimental data . Chelator - Protein Interaction - One potential problem with the method used here is that the chelator might bind to the protein and that such an interaction could alter the Ca2 + affinity for the chelator and / or the protein . Chiancone et al . ( 1986 ) have used static difference absorbance experiments to show that the parent compound ( BAPTA ) interacts with calmodulin at low ionic strength . The concentration ranges used in that study were 220 - 260 PM for BAPTA and 18 - 75 PM for calmodulin . The product of these two concentrations was thus 10 - to 30 - fold higher than that in the present work . When applying the same method as that described by Chian - cone et al . ( 1986 ) to 30 PM 5 , 5 ' - Br2BAPTA and 30 PM cal - modulin at low ionic strength , no interaction could be detected ( detection limit AA = kO . 001 , data not shown ) . We find it reasonable to assume that interaction between chelator and protein is not an important factor in the present experiments . Ca2 + Binding to the Tryptic Fragments - Each fragment binds two Ca2 + ions with affinities in the range accessible with the chelator used in this study ( = 106 - 108 M " at low ionic strength ) . The two macroscopic binding constants , Kl and K2 , obtained for TRIC and TR , C at different KC1 concentrations are summarized in Table I . Kl and K , , expressed in molar concentration units , can be used to calculate the free energy of binding of two Ca2 + ions , AG , , , = - RTln ( K1K2 ) . For both fragments and at all salt concentrations , we find that K2 > Kl / 4 which implies positive cooperativity . ( Note K , > Kl / 4 always implies positive cooperativity , but if the two sites do not have identical affinities , positive cooperativity can exist even if K2 < K1 / 4 . ) The cooperativity in a two - site system can be characterized by AAG , the effect of Ca2 + binding to one of the sites on the free energy of Ca2 + binding to the other site ( Weber , 1975 ) . AAG = AGIJI - AGI = AGII , ~ - AGII = - RTln ( K1 , dKd = - RTln ( Kr , r / Kd where AGI . 11 is the free energy of Ca2 + binding to site I when a Ca2 + ion is already bound to site I1 ( cf . Fig . 3A ) and KIJI etc . are the corresponding microscopic ( site ) binding con - stants . The titrations in the presence of 5 , 5 ' - Br , BAPTA do not allow one to determine the distribution of Ca2 + between the sites of the protein and hence yield only the macroscopic binding constants . However , one can use the relations be - tween macroscopic and microscopic binding constants ( Kl = KI + KII and KlK2 = KIKII , I = KIIKIJI ) and write - AAG = RTln ( 4K2 / K1 ) + RTln ( ( q + 1 ) ' / 4q ) where q = KII / KI . The second term is zero for 7 = 1 ( equally strong sites ) , and we may thus obtain a lower limit of - AAG solely from the macroscopic binding constants as - AAG , = l = RTln ( 4K2 / K1 ) ( Linse et al . , 1987 , 1988 ) . Thus , it is apparent from the results in Table I that each fragment binds two Ca2 + ions with positive cooperativity and relatively high affinity . At low ionic strength , the Ca2 + affinity for the C - terminal fragment , TR2C , is on average 6 - fold higher than for TRIC if we compare m . There is a considerable decrease in the Ca2 + affinity on going from low ionic strength conditions to 150 mM KC1 . For TR2C , the product of Kl and K2 is reduced 5000 - fold , corresponding to a 21 kJ . mol - ' increase in AG , , , and for TRIC the corresponding figures are 3200 - fold and 20 kJ . mol " . K + Binding - On the assumption that the decrease in the Ca2 + affinity of calmodulin that occurs on adding KC1 arises solely from competition between K + and Ca2 + , Haiech et al . ( 1981 ) have concluded that potassium binds competitively to the Ca2 + sites . Part of the KC1 effect could , however , be simply due to nonspecific ionic strength effects : screening of electro - static interactions and change in activity coefficients . To investigate this point , two - dimensional ' H NMR COSY spec - tra were recorded for Ca2 + - depleted tryptic fragments at pH 7 . 5 , 27 " C in the absence and presence of 150 mM KC1 . The NH and C " H chemical shifts of nearly all NH - C " H cross - peaks were measured ( a small number were missing owing to fast exchange ) . For TRIC , the average shift difference between 0 and 150 mM KC1 was 0 . 02 ppm for NH and 0 . 01 ppm for C " H , the largest difference being 0 . 07 ppm . For TR2C , the average shift difference was 0 . 01 ppm for both NH and C " H , the largest difference being 0 . 04 ppm . These results are very similar to what was found in the case of calbindin Dgk and indicate that any binding of K + ions to calmodulin has only a minimal effect on the protein conformation . Thus , the effect of KC1 on the Ca2 + affinities of the proteins is nonspecific . In the apo form of the protein , it is likely that the Ca2 + ligands repel each other and cannot fold in the proper conformation for Ca2 + coordination . It has been suggested that the charge on K + is too low to overcome the ligand repulsion and that K + - binding would not result in the same arrangement of the ligands as in the Ca2 + - bound state ( Snyder et al . , 1990 ) .

The experimental data for intact calmodulin as displayed in Fig . 1 has w been analyzed as regards the dependence a of ESS on the values of the different $ 2 . O parameters . Each point in the curve for 2 AG : : , is obtained by keeping the product of Kl and K2 ( and hence Act : , ) constant while letting AMAX , AMIN , F , K2 , Kd , and the individual values of Kl and K2 adjust their values to obtain the lowest possible ESS for the specific value of 0 . 0 Act : , .

Ca2 + binding to a protein with four Ca2 + sites could be exceedingly complex due to possible interactions between any pair among the four sites . The analysis is simplified if two of the sites have considerably higher Ca2 + affinity than the other two .

We can calculate the free energy of binding the first two ( AGg = - RTln [ KlK2 ] ) and last two ( AGE , = - RTln [ K3K4 ] ) Ca2 + ions and lower limits of the cooperativity within these pairs ( - AAG ; % , = RTln ( 4 K2 / Kl ) and - AAq ' kl = RTln ( 4 K4 / K3 ) , respectively ) . The values of the four macroscopic binding constants show that the sites in calmodulin are grouped into two pairs of different strength , each pair dis - playing positive cooperativity . If we calculate AG & AG : & - AAG : = and - AAG $ ( Table 111 ) and compare with the results for the fragments ( Table I ) , we can conclude that the two sites of the C - terminal domain in calmodulin bind Ca2 + most strongly in a cooperative manner . The N - terminal do - main binds Ca2 + 6 times more weakly but also cooperatively . The condition KIII and Klv > > KI and KIl does not hold strictly for calmodulin . The above treatment nevertheless gives lower limits to the cooperativity , and no false indications of positive cooperativity could arise . As can be seen in Fig . 2 , the preci - sion in AGEt and AG : , ( or the products KlK2 and K3K4 ) is high , whereas the precision in AAG : : , and AAGP = , ( or the ratios K2 / Kl and K4 / K3 ) is considerably lower . Since the two globular domains of calmodulin bind in a sequential manner , it is not straightforward to assess whether Ca2 + binding to one globular domain affects the Ca2 + affinities 8054 Cu2 + Binding to Calmodulin of the sites in the other domain . However , the free energy values calculated for intact calmodulin ( Table 111 ) are , within the error limits , identical with those of the isolated fragments ( Table I ) . Thus , the globular domains in calmodulin appear to bind Caz + independently of each other . In contrast , coop - erativity between the globular domains has been observed when calmodulin is complexed with peptides or fragments of target enzymes ( Yazawa et al . , 1987 ; Ikura et al . , 1989 ) . Salt Effects on pK , Values of Ionizable Groups - The pH titrations of the fragments in the presence of the chelator and half - saturationg concentrations of Ca2 + show different behav - ior at 0 and 150 mM KCI . For both fragments , it is found that at low ionic strength there is a considerable increase in Ca2 + affinity when pH is raised from 6 . 5 to 8 . 5 , whereas at 150 mM KC1 the Ca2 + affinity is constant in the same pH interval . It thus seems that KC1 in some way affects the ionizable groups in the pH range 6 . 5 - 8 . 5 . It is not possible to judge from the present experiments whether these effects are predominantly nonspecific or if K + ions compete with protons for specific side chains . The linewidth of the 39K NMR signal is consid - erably increased in the presence of calmodulin ' which indi - cates that K + ions are weakly associated to calmodulin ( cf . a similar study on calbindin Dgk : Linse et al . , 1991 ) . In any case , theoretical treatment of the Ca2 + affinity of calmodulin at pH 7 . 5 is likely to overestimate the salt effects , if the protein surface charge is kept the same at all salt concentrations . In addition , the pH titrations show for both fragments a consid - erable increase in Ca2 + affinity in the pH range 9 - 11 , both at low and high salt concentration . The latter effect is most likely a result of deprotonation of lysine side chains . If H + binding to some ionizable groups affects pKc , , Ca2 + binding will affect pK , of the same ionizable groups . In fact , Ca2 + binding to calmodulin and its tryptic fragments has been reported to result in proton uptake or release ( Milos et al . , 1986 ; Sellers et al . , 1991 ) . Comparison with Previous Studies - Many of the previous studies of Ca2 + binding to calmodulin have failed to distin - guish between cooperative and independent binding , either because the method used is not sensitive enough or the data analysis has extracted information ( e . g . affinities for individ - ual sites ) that is not present in the data itself . Nevertheless , if we disregard all studies that assume identical and inde - pendent sites , the values for the products of the first two and last two macroscopic binding constants ( K A and K3KJ should be closely similar in all studies that are free from large systematic errors . The values reported here for lg ( KIKz ) and lg ( K3K4 ) of calmodulin in 150 mM KC1 and 2 mM Tris / HCl ( 10 . 9 and 9 . 3 , respectively ) , fall in the range of those of previous studies at comparable conditions ( 10 . 4 - 11 . 1 and 8 . 0 - 9 . 4 , respectively ) . To our knowledge no measurements have previously been performed at an ionic strength as low as in the present work ( 0 M KCI , 2 mM Tris / HCl ) . We may , however , note that the results we report for 10 mM KC1 and 2 mM Tris / HCl ( lg ( KlK2 ) = 13 . 6 and lg ( K3K4 ) = 12 . 0 ) are , as T . Drakenberg , personal communication . expected , only slightly lower than those published by Haiech et al . ( 1981 ) . For 0 M KC1 and 10 mM Tris / HCl , pH 7 . 55 , they report lg ( KlK2 ) = 13 . 7 and lg ( K & ) = 12 . 1 . Conclusion - A detailed reinvestigation of the calcium - bind - ing constants of calmodulin , using the chromophoric chelator 5 , 5 ' - BrzBAPTA , has provided strong evidence for cooperative Ca2 + binding within each globular domain , both at low and high ionic strength . There is no indication of cooperativity between the two domains . Rather , comparisons with the tryp - tic fragments strongly suggest that the two domains bind Ca2 + independently of each other . The Ca2 + affinities of the sites in the C - terminal domain are on average 6 - fold higher than those of the sites in the N - terminal domain .
