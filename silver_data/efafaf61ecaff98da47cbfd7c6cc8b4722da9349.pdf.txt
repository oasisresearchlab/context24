The driving force for these processes is the dynamic reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton . Actin ﬁlaments can form a diverse array of structures at the leading edge of migrating cells including lamellipodia , which are broad , sheet - like projections containing a network of short branched ﬁlaments , and ﬁlopodia , which are thin needle - like projections containing bundles of long , parallel ﬁlaments ( Small et al , 2002 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Recent years have seen a great increase in our understanding of the proteins that control the formation of these actin structures in response to receptor - mediated stimuli . These include the ﬁlament nucleating Arp2 / 3 com - plex and its activators , the WASP / Scar / WAVE protein family as well as the Mena / VASP proteins , which promote ﬁlament elongation ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Millard et al , 2004 ) . The Rho family of GTPases also represent important actin regulators , notably Cdc42 and Rac , which promote the formation of ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia , respectively ( Hall , 1998 ) . An actin regulator that has attracted a great deal of attention recently is the ‘insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53’ ( IRSp53 ) , also known as ‘brain - speciﬁc angio - genesis inhibitor 1 associated protein 2’ ( BAIAP2 ) ( Yeh et al , 1996 ) . This ubiquitously expressed multidomain scaf - folding protein has been implicated by several studies in ﬁlopodium formation ( Govind et al , 2001 ; Krugmann et al , 2001 ; Yamagishi et al , 2004 ) . At least one study has found evidence for a link between IRSp53 and lamellipodium for - mation ( Miki et al , 2000 ) . This evidence is further supported by the observation that IRSp53 localises to the tips of both ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia ( Nakagawa et al , 2003 ) . IRSp53 comprises a central CRIB motif followed by an SH3 domain , and WW and PDZ domain - binding motifs at the C - terminus ( Figure 1A ) ( Govind et al , 2001 ; Krugmann et al , 2001 ; Hori et al , 2003 ; Soltau et al , 2004 ) . Binding of activated Cdc42 to the CRIB motif enhances the ability of IRSp53 to promote ﬁlopodium formation , suggesting that IRSp53 may play a key role in the induction of ﬁlopodia by Cdc42 ( Govind et al , 2001 ; Krugmann et al , 2001 ; Yamagishi et al , 2004 ) . Interestingly , activation of IRSp53 by Rac1 does not depend on the presence of the CRIB motif , as this GTPase appears to bind to a distinct site located within the N - terminal 230 amino acids of IRSp53 ( Miki et al , 2000 ; Miki and Takenawa , 2002 ) . IRSp53 has been shown to bind , through its SH3 domain , to proline - rich regions of a number of known actin regulators , such as Scar2 / WAVE2 ( Miki et al , 2000 ; Miki and Takenawa , 2002 ) , Mena ( Krugmann et al , 2001 ) , mDia1 ( Fujiwara et al , 2000 ) , ProSAP / shank ( Bockmann et al , 2002 ; Soltau et al , 2002 ) , espin ( Sekerkova et al , 2003 ) and eps8 ( Funato et al , 2004 ) . At least in a subset of cases , there is evidence to suggest that these interactions are dependent on IRSp53 being activated by binding active Cdc42 ( Fujiwara et al , 2000 ; Krugmann et al , 2001 ; Soltau et al , 2002 ) or Rac ( Miki et al , 2000 ; Miki and Takenawa , 2002 ) . Furthermore , IRSp53 emerged as a binding partner of PDZ - domain - containing proteins such as PSD - 95 in the post - synaptic density and MALS at cell – cell contacts ( Hori et al , 2003 ; Soltau et al , 2004 ) .

It has recently been established that the N - terminal 250 amino acids of IRSp53 form a conserved domain that is able to bundle actin ﬁlaments ( Yamagishi et al , 2004 ) . The IRSp53 and MIM homology domain ( IMD ) occurs in IRSp53 and the B isoform of ‘missing in metastasis’ ( MIM - B ) , a recently described actin regulator , as well as in at least three uncharacterised mammalian proteins ( Figure 1B ) , and orthologues exist in both Drosophila and Caenorhabditis Figure 1 Domain structure of IRSp53 and sequence alignment of IMD and BAR domains .

The IMD constitutes the only domain shared between IRSp53 and MIM - B , and the IMD of either protein , in isolation , is able to bundle actin ﬁbres in vitro and to induce ﬁlopodia formation in vivo ( Yamagishi et al , 2004 ) . We report here the crystal structure of the IMD of IRSp53 determined to 2 . 2A˚ resolution . This structure together with site - directed mutagenesis and functional assays provides insights into the mechanism of action of IRSp53 and that of other IMD - containing proteins . Results Overall structure and topology The crystal structure of the IMD of human IRSp53 ( residues 1 – 250 ) has been determined de novo by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion and reﬁned to a resolution of 2 . 2A˚ ( Table I ) . The experimental density map ( Figure 2A ) deline - ates the entire polypeptide with the exception of two N - terminal and two C - terminal residues , the former arising from the expression construct .

The dimer is about 25A˚ in diameter and measures 180 A˚ in length , with the dyad relating the two monomers roughly parallel to the crystallographic b - axis . The IMD monomer folds as a coiled coil of three extended a - helices and a shorter C - terminal helix that is separated by an 8 - residue linker from the preceding helix 3 . Helix 4 packs tightly against the other three helices , and thus represents an integral part of the domain . The fold of the IMD monomer closely resembles that of the BAR ( Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ) domain of arfaptin2 and amphiphy - sin ( Tarricone et al , 2001 ; Peter et al , 2004 ) , but the dimers show markedly different shapes ( Figure 2D ) . The C - terminus of helix 4 is adjacent to the N - terminus of helix 1 of the opposite monomer , with the domain termini falling onto the boundary of the central region , an area approximately de - ﬁned by the extent of the dimer interface . Helices 2 and 3 protrude beyond the central region , which is made up of a 6 - helix bundle , and the poorly ordered 2 – 3 loops demarcate the extreme ends of the dimer . The dimer interface The dimer interface is very extensive burrying about 5800 A˚ 2 of solvent - accessible surface , with a contact surface area of Figure 2 Structure of the IMD of human IRSp53 .

By comparison , the crescent - shaped dimer of the BAR domain of amphiphy - sin buries about 3500A˚ 2 of solvent - accessible surface , with B 620A˚ 2 contact surface area per monomer ( Figure 3B ) . Hydrophobic and polar surfaces contribute to nearly equal parts to the contact surface area , which involves all four helices ( Figure 1B ) . The interface encloses a substantial cavity of B 930A˚ 3 that contains several water molecules . Cysteines 195 and 230 of opposite chains are juxtaposed such that disulphide bond formation across the dimer interface is geometrically possible , but suppressed due to the presence of 5mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) in the acidic crystallisation buffer ( pH 4 . 6 ) . Disulphide bond formation is indeed observed on a denaturing SDS – acrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions , but not when Cys230 is mutated to alanine ( Figure 4A ) . This provides independent evidence that the dimer interface revealed by the crystal structure is likely physiologically relevant . In order to verify the oligo - merisation state of the IMD in solution , we performed sedimentation velocity experiments in the presence of DTT ( mirroring the crystallisation conditions ) , which indicated a single molecular species at a sedimentation coefﬁcient of 3 . 25 s ( Figure 4B ) . Fitting the data to a single species model yields a molecular weight of 56792Da ( 95 % conﬁdence interval : 51 517 – 60 642 ) , representing twice the calculated molecular weight of the IMD monomer , 28563Da . No other species can be detected . In agreement with previous data ( Yamagishi et al , 2004 ) , we also observed self - association of full - length IRSp53 in COS7 cell lysates as myc - tagged IRSp53 co - immunoprecipi - tated with HA - tagged IRSp53 ( data not shown ) . Thus , the IMD forms a dimer in solution and is likely responsible for the observed dimerisation of the full - length protein in vivo . Structural differences between monomers The present model of the IMD dimer has been constructed without applying noncrystallographic symmetry restraints throughout phasing , model building and reﬁnement , allow - ing to detect potential conformational differences between the monomers . The two subunits superimpose very well within the core region ( residues 1 – 130 and 173 – 248 , root mean square deviation ( r . m . s . d . ) 0 . 57A˚ for 206 C a positions ) that is deﬁned by the extent of the dimer interface . In contrast , when all 248 C a positions of the present model are included to calculate the superimposition , the r . m . s . d . increases almost three - fold to 1 . 5A˚ , reﬂecting a signiﬁcant level of conformational freedom for those parts of helices 2 and 3 that extend beyond the core region . Accordingly , drastic differences between the monomers in terms of side chain or backbone conformation fall outside the core region , with one notable exception : the side chain of Tyr115 , which is located adjacent to a kink in helix 2 . In chain A , the Tyr115 hydroxyl is observed to form a tight hydrogen bond with Glu189 in helix 3 . In chain B , this side chain is rotated by almost 180 1 away from Glu189 and interacts with a symmetry - related molecule . The side chain rotation opens a sizeable crevice in the surface of the IMD that exposes the guanido group of Arg193 to solvent . We note that both Glu189 and Arg193 , albeit not Tyr115 , are invariant residues belonging to the IMD signature motif ( see below ) . This fact may suggest that the observed conformational difference might be of functional signiﬁcance , a question that is not further addressed in this study . Sequence conservation The surface area of the IMD dimer displays a marked polarity in terms of sequence conservation with respect to the ﬁve IMD sequences in Figure 1B . When the dyad axis of the dimer is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the paper , the N - and C - termini of the IMD dimer are displayed on the front and back faces of the dimer , respectively ( Figure 3C , upper and lower panel ) . The N - terminal face shows extended patches of invariant solvent - exposed residues , while the C - terminal face is almost completely devoid of invariant or highly conserved residues . The two extended , dyad - related patches of invariant residues seen on the N - terminal side include Met21 , Pro26 , Figure 4 In vitro characterisation of the IMD of IRSp53 and inter - action with F - actin .

These patches surround two distinct voids in the molecular surface of the IMD dimer , which are bounded by the N - terminus on the core side of the dimer , and by the cluster of conserved basic residues ( Lys142 – Lys147 ) on the other side . Interestingly , the signature sequence of the IMD ( residues 186 – 197 , ALXEE [ RK ] [ RG ] RFCX ( 0 , 1 ) F [ IL ] ; Yamagishi et al , 2004 ) is mostly buried in the dimer . Residues in its core segment 189 EERRR 193 make contacts with other conserved parts of the opposite monomer ( Figure 2A and B ) , notably with the loop linking helices 1 and 2 , and the 8 - residue linker separating helices 3 and 4 . For instance , Glu190 forms strong hydrogen bonds with the backbone amides of Gln67 and Gly68 in the 1 – 2 loop ( Figure 2A ) ; Arg191 forms salt bridges to residues Glu71 and the carbonyl oxygen of Asp232 ; Arg193 makes van der Waals contacts with Phe24 and Ile20 of the same monomer , ‘pushing’ into a kink of helix 1 . The polarity in terms of sequence conservation is mir - rored , albeit to a lesser degree , by a noticeable polarity of the surface charge distribution . The extreme ends of the dimer present a strong positive surface potential on the N - terminal side , but do so to a much lesser degree on the C - terminal side . Elsewhere on the surface , the charge distribution appears more or less even , with positive charges slightly prevailing overall ( Figure 3D ) . Identiﬁcation of residues involved in actin binding At the extreme ends of the dimer are a cluster of basic surface residues that are well conserved between the ﬁve known mammalian IMDs , suggesting that these were likely to be signiﬁcant to IMD function . Electron microscopy of IMD - induced F - actin bundles reveals that the centres of adjacent F - actin ﬁbres are spaced about 11 nm apart ( Yamagishi et al , 2004 ) and this distance correlates with the distance between the conserved basic patches . Moreover , the surface charge of F - actin ﬁbres is highly acidic , suggesting that basic surface areas of the IMD dimer are likely to be involved in F - actin binding . We therefore targeted the extreme ends of the dimer in a mutational analysis . Mutant constructs were ﬁrst made based on plasmids encoding full - length IRSp53 and assayed in vivo . Mutations that showed compromised ﬁlopodia for - mation were then followed up by making the same mutations in plasmid constructs encoding the IMD alone . We found initially that mutant forms of IRSp53 , where only a single site was altered in the Lys142 – Lys147 cluster , were indistinguish - able from wild - type IRSp53 in the cell - based assay ( data not shown ) . In contrast , altering all four lysines ( 142 , 143 , 146 and 147 ) to glutamic acid dramatically affected the behaviour of both full - length IRSp53 and the IMD . Wild - type ( IMDwt ) and mutant ( IMDmut , K142E , K143E , K146E , K147E ) forms of the IMD of IRSp53 were expressed as glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and puriﬁed to homogeneity in their tag - free form . IMDwt and IMDmut were indistinguishable in circular dichroism spectroscopy experiments ( Figure 4C ) . While the sedimentation velocity experiments indicated a slight tendency of the mutant to aggregate ( peak at 4 . 5 s , Figure 4B ) , the predominant species in solution is still the dimer peak and , crucially , its sedimenation coefﬁcient is unchanged from that of wild - type IMD , indicating clearly that the global conformation of the dimer is unchanged by the site - directed mutagenesis . Thus , the mutation did not affect the association state or the fold of the IMD . F - actin binding by IMDwt and IMDmut was analysed using a ﬁlament cosedi - mentation assay varying the concentration of IMD . The pellet fractions were analysed by SDS – polyacrylamide gel electro - phoresis and the gels evaluated densitometrically ( Figure 4D ) . The equilibrium dissociation constant K d derived from these binding curves is 5 and 10 m M for IMDwt and IMDmut , respectively . While the nature of this assay limits the accuracy of the K d values obtained , it unambiguously demonstrates that the weakened binding afﬁnity of IMDmut for F - actin . Actin bundling was assayed in vitro using a low - speed cosedimentation assay . In the absence of IMD , 25 % of F - actin was typically found in the pellet . Addition of IMDwt resulted in a concentration - dependent increase of the proportion of F - actin in the pellet , demonstrating ﬁlament bundling ( Figure 4E , left panels ) , whereas addition of IMDmut had no effect on the partitioning of F - actin between pellet and supernatant ( Figure 4E , right panels ) . In an independent assay , F - actin coupled to a ﬂuorescent dye ( Machesky and Hall , 1997 ) was incubated with IMDwt and IMDmut at various concentrations and then visualised by ﬂuorescence light microscopy . The presence of IMDwt re - sulted in the formation of visible actin bundles ( Figure 4F ) . Single bundles as well as branched networks of bundles were observed . The number and size of bundles increased with IMDwt concentration as did the extent of branching . No bundles were observed at any concentration of IMDmut tested . These data demonstrate that although IMDmut is correctly folded and present as a dimer ( Figure 4B and C ) , it cannot bundle actin ﬁbres due to the disruption of the actin - binding sites . Mutation of basic patches of IMD abrogates ﬁlopodium formation by IRSp53 Several groups have observed that overexpression of IRSp53 in a range of cell lines results in the formation of ﬁlopodia . Overexpressing myc - tagged IRSp53 in COS7 cells , we ob - served long ﬁlopodia that were often branched ( Figure 5A ) . While ﬁlopodia were observed in untransfected COS7 cells , these were usually short ( o 10 m m ) and clearly distinguish - able from those induced by IRSp53 overexpression , which were typically 10 – 60 m m in length . Myc - tagged IRSp53 was localised throughout the ﬁlopodia and often concentrated at the tip . As described previously ( Yamagishi et al , 2004 ) , we observed that expression of the isolated IMD of IRSp53 also resulted in the formation of ﬁlopodia ( Figure 5B ) , while deletion constructs of IRSp53 that lacked the IMD were unable to induce ﬁlopodia formation ( data not shown ) . IMD - induced ﬁlopodia tended to be less frequently branched than those induced by full - length IRSp53 . In marked contrast to the wild - type constructs , myc - tagged forms of IMDmut or of full length IRSp53 carrying the analogous mutation failed to display ﬁlopodia formation above the level of untransfected cells ( Figure 5 ) . This clearly demonstrates that IRSp53 mutants whose actin - binding and actin - bundling activity is compromised cannot induce ﬁlopodia , establishing a molecular basis of IRSp53 - induced ﬁlopodia formation . Structure of the IRSp53 actin - bundling domain TH Millard et al & 2005 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 24 | NO 2 | 2005 245 Discussion The IMD constitutes a novel actin - bundling domain that is essential for IRSp53 function . Our results conﬁrm previously published data that the IMD is required for IRSp53 - induced ﬁlopodia formation , and that this domain crosslinks F - actin to form bundles of ﬁlaments . We show here , for the ﬁrst time , that ﬁlopodia formation induced by full - length IRSp53 or the IMD in isolation is compromised when the actin - binding sites in the IMD are mutated . This indicates that IMD - mediated actin - binding and actin - bundling activity is required for IRSp53 - induced ﬁlopodium formation . Chemical crosslinking and co - immunoprecipitation data have previously suggested IMD - mediated dimerisation of IRSp53 ( Yamagishi et al , 2004 ) . Analytical ultracentrifugation in sedimentation velo - city mode conﬁrms that the IMD exists as a dimer in solution , and co - immunoprecipitation data indicate dimerisation of full - length IRSp53 in vivo . The crystal structure reveals that IMD dimerisation is mediated by a vast interface , of which about 50 % are contributed by hydrophobic residues , strongly suggesting that this interface is physiologically relevant . Together , these data argue that F - actin - bundling activity is mediated through the bivalent nature of the IMD dimer . The mutational analysis maps the actin - binding sites to the ex - treme ends of the dimer . The binding sites and the C - termini of the IMD subunits fall on opposite sides of the dimer , reconciling space requirements of the actin ﬁlaments and the C - terminal domains of IRSp53 . The orientation in which the IMD dimer binds F - actin is not known . In one possible scenario , the two - fold axis of the dimer is oriented perpendi - cular to the ﬁlament axes , that is , in the orientation of Figure 3C , the ﬁlament axes would run vertically along the plane of the paper on the N - terminal side of the dimer . In this binding mode , the IMD would present surface patches with opposite polarity to parallel F - actin ﬁlaments . The question of surface polarity can be resolved , if it is assumed that the two - fold axis of the dimer is oriented parallel to the ﬁbre axes . With respect to Figure 3C , the ﬁlaments would run perpendi - cular to the plane of the paper , one above and one below of the IMD dimer . In this scenario , the extreme ends of the dimer could contact the underside of one of the outer domains of actin . The IMD differs signiﬁcantly in structure from that of other ‘dedicated’ actin - binding or actin - bundling domains . Coiled - coil domains frequently mediate protein oligomerisation both in actin - crosslinking proteins and elsewhere , for instance , in the rod domain of a - actinin ( Ylanne et al , 2001 ) , or the C - terminal domain of cortexillin ( Faix et al , 1996 ; Burkhard et al , 2000 ) . F - actin binding has been reported for a subset of the coiled - coil spectrin - like repeats of the rod domains of dystrophin and utrophin ( Amann et al , 1998 ; Rybakova et al , 2002 ) . However , both proteins also contain a ‘dedicated’ actin - binding domain based on the tandem repeat of the calponin homology domain ( Carugo et al , 1997 ) . This tandem repeat is conserved among actin - binding domains of the utrophin superfamily , and the F - actin - binding sites in the rod domain have been suggested to help increase overall binding afﬁnity . The actin - bundling proteins ﬁmbrin and fascin are of particular interest , as both have been implicated in ﬁlopodia formation ( Small et al , 2002 ) . The actin - bundling core of ﬁmbrin ( Klein et al , 2004 ) is composed of four calponin homology domains , a duplication of the calponin homology domain tandem repeat . In contrast , fascin ( pdb entry 1dfc , Fedorov et al , unpublished ) is composed of four repeats of the b - trefoil domain ( Ponting and Russell , 2000 ) . Thus , the elementary structural unit in the actin - binding domains of both ﬁmbrin and fascin is a compact globular Figure 5 Analysis of IRSp53 and IMD overexpression in COS7 cells . ( A ) Plasmid constructs encoding myc - tagged forms of either IRSp53 ( wild - type ) or IRSp53 ( mutant ) were transfected into COS7 cells for 24h , ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde and stained with TRITC – phalloi - din and anti - myc , followed by a ﬂuorescent secondary antibody . Coverslips were visualised by ﬂuorescence microscopy .

( C ) Cell counts comparing ﬁlopodia formation in transfected versus untransfected COS7 cells . Error bars represent standard deviations from three independent blind experiments counting approximately 35 transfected and untransfected cells for each condition . Cells were scored positive for ﬁlopodia if they showed at least ﬁve ﬁlopodia with a length greater than 10 % of the cell diameter , corresponding to approximately 10 m m . Structure of the IRSp53 actin - bundling domain TH Millard et al The EMBO Journal VOL 24 | NO 2 | 2005 & 2005 European Molecular Biology Organization 246 domain . Based on a DALI search ( http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / dali ; Holm and Sander , 1998 ) , the closest structural relative of the IMD representing a ‘dedicated’ F - actin - binding domain ap - pears to be the tail piece of vinculin ( Bakolitsa et al , 1999 , 2004 ; Izard et al , 2004 ) . Ranked 17 in the DALI search with a Z - score of 7 . 4 ( compared to 12 . 8 – 11 . 8 for the top hits , the amphiphysin and arfaptin2 BAR domains ) , the vinculin tail piece forms a compact 5 - helix bundle that , upon activation by talin , binds F - actin ( Bakolitsa et al , 2004 ; Izard et al , 2004 ) . However , vinculin has no actin - bundling activity . The similarity of the IMD to the BAR domain , a functional module serving both as a sensor and inducer of membrane curvature ( Peter et al , 2004 ) , is intriguing . Despite displaying different shapes and being functionally distinct , the two domains form superimposable dimers ( r . m . s . d . 1 . 9 A˚ for 226 of 496 C a positions , Figure 2D ) and present both promi - nent positive surface charges at the extreme ends . Hallmarks that distinguish the IMD from the BAR domain include the fourth helix at the C - terminus of and the IMD signature motif . Helix 4 , an integral part of the IMD , is chieﬂy responsible for the much larger dimer interface of the IMD and also appears to stabilise the extended , straight conformation of helices 2 and 3 . The core segment of the IMD signature motif ( 189 EERRR 193 ) , which is not conserved in BAR domains , is engaged in a number of intradimer interactions , notably with the 8 - residue linker between helices 3 and 4 , a structural element not present in the BAR domain . While binding of the IRSp53 - SH3 domain to the proline - rich regions of various actin cytoskeleton regulating proteins depends on activation by Cdc42 or Rac1 ( Miki et al , 2000 ; Krugmann et al , 2001 ; Bockmann et al , 2002 ; Miki and Takenawa , 2002 ; Soltau et al , 2002 ) , it is not known whether these small G proteins directly affect IMD - mediated actin - bundling activity . Based on the present structure , it is con - ceivable that Cdc42 binding to IRSp53 may involve ( nonspe - ciﬁc ) contacts with the IMD , as the Cdc42 - binding site , the CRIB motif ( residues 266 – 279 ) , is located only 16 residues C - terminal to the IMD . Rac1 , in contrast , has been reported to bind directly to the IMD ( Miki et al , 2000 ; Miki and Takenawa , 2002 ) , consistent with our own experimental data ( not shown ) . A model for Rac1 binding to the IMD can be readily derived by superimposing the IMD structure with the Rac1 - arfaptin2 complex ( Tarricone et al , 2001 ) . Sequence conservation at the putative Rac1 - binding site is weak , but the model entails only minor steric clashes , placing Rac1 centrally on the N - terminal side of the IMD dimer . While Rac1 has been shown to enhance IRSp53 - induced ﬁlopodia forma - tion in vivo ( Yamagishi et al , 2004 ) , we have not found that constitutively active Rac1 signiﬁcantly enhances IMD - mediated bundling activity in vitro ( data not shown ) . However , the assay employed , a low - speed cosedimentation assay , might not be sensitive enough to detect subtle regula - tory effects . It has previously been suggested that IRSp53 functions as a scaffolding protein , recruiting other signaling proteins and effectors to sites of ﬁlopodia assembly . If there is indeed , as our data suggest , a direct mechanistic link between IMD - mediated actin bundling and IRSp53 - induced ﬁlopodia for - mation , IRSp53 would have to be considered a protein that integrates regulatory and effector functions . Mena / VASP pro - teins , which have been implicated in ﬁlopodium formation and associate with IRSp53 through the IRSp53 - SH3 domain , promote ﬁlament lengthening by inhibiting barbed end cap - ping ( Bear et al , 2002 ; Lebrand et al , 2004 ; Mejillano et al , 2004 ) . It is conceivable that ﬁlopodium formation in response to activation by Rho - family GTPases is facilitated by the combined effect of Mena - controlled inhibition of barbed end capping and IRSp53 - induced F - actin bundling . Pre - exist - ing bundles in the ﬁlopodium may and then be further stabilised by other actin - bundling proteins such as ﬁmbrin and fascin . The presence of a range of protein interaction motifs within IRSp53 and the large set of identiﬁed IRSp53 binding partners further underscore the proposed dual func - tion of IRSp53 as a scaffolding and effector protein . They also suggest that the regulatory role of IRSp53 may extend beyond the initiation of ﬁlopodia formation . Materials and methods DNA constructs Human IRSp53 in the mammalian expression vector pRK5myc was obtained from Dr Alan Hall ( LMCB , London ) ( Krugmann et al , 2001 ) . This was used as a template to amplify the region encoding the IMD ( amino acids 1 – 250 ) of IRSp53 by polymerase chain reaction . Sites for restriction enzymes Bam HI and Eco RI were introduced into the forward and reverse primers , respectively , and these sites were used to clone the construct into pRK5myc and pGEX4T2 ( Amersham Biosciences ) plasmids . Site - directed muta - genesis was performed using the QuikChange procedure ( Strata - gene ) following the manufacturer’s recommendations . All primers were purchased from Sigma - Genosys . DNA sequencing of all constructs was performed by the University of Birmingham Functional Genomics laboratory . Protein expression and puriﬁcation Plasmids pGEX4T2 containing the coding sequence of the IMD were transformed into the methionine - auxotroph strain E . coli B834 ( DE3 ) , obtained from Professor JB Jackson ( University of Birmingham ) , for the purpose of crystallographic structure deter - mination , or into E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) for the biochemical assays . The transformants were used to inoculate 4l of minimal M9 medium ( Sambrook et al , 1998 ) supplemented with 50 m g / ml seleno - methionine ( Fisher Scientiﬁc ) and 100 m g / ml ampicillin ( Sigma ) , while unlabelled protein was produced in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium supplemented with 100 m g / ml ampicillin . Cultures were grown at 37 1 C to OD 600 0 . 45 , and protein expression was induced with 1mM IPTG ( Melford labs ) for 14h at 25 1 C . Cells were lysed by sonication in PBS / 1 % Triton X - 100 containing a protease inhibitor cocktail . The cleared sonicate was then passed three times over a glutathione – agarose column . The column was washed with the sonication buffer followed by thrombin buffer ( 150mM NaCl , 50mM Tris – Cl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 5mM MgCl 2 , 2 . 5mM CaCl 2 , 1mM DTT ) . Thrombin ( 40U ) ( Calbiochem ) was added in one column volume of thrombin buffer and the column incubated for 15h ( 4 1 C ) . Thrombin - cleaved IMD was eluted with thrombin buffer and dialysed into 140mM NaCl , 20mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 5mM MgCl 2 , 2 . 5mM CaCl 2 , 1mM DTT , bound to a carboxymethyl – sepharose column and eluted with a linear gradient of 140 – 500mM NaCl . Fractions were analysed by SDS – PAGE , and those containing pure IMD were pooled and concentrated to 50mg / ml protein using Vivaspin 15 ( Vivascience ) and centricon 10 ( Amicon ) ultraﬁltration columns . Crystallisation and structure determination Crystals of the seleno - methionine - labelled form of the IMD of IRSp53 were grown by hanging drop vapour diffusion over a reservoir containing 15 – 18 % ( w / v ) polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) 6000 , 0 . 1M sodium acetate ( pH 4 . 6 ) , 15 – 70mM ammonium acetate , 5mM DTT and small concentrations of either sucrose ( 2 – 6 % ( w / v ) ) or ethylene glycol ( 10 – 12 % ( v / v ) ) . Crystals appeared and grew to ﬁnal size over night , but showed signs of decay only a few days later . Therefore , crystals were ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen promptly as follows . High - quality diffraction patterns were obtained by soaking crystals in a cryoprotection buffer based on the Structure of the IRSp53 actin - bundling domain TH Millard et al & 2005 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 24 | NO 2 | 2005 247 reservoir solution , but with PEG 6000 increased to 30 % ( w / v ) and 20 % ethylene glycol or sucrose prior to data collection from ﬂash frozen crystals . Crystals were in space group P2 1 ( Table I ) with two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit . A three - wavelength MAD data set was recorded on station 14 . 2 at SRS Daresbury ( Warrington , UK ) integrated and scaled using MOSFLM / SCALA ( Leslie , 1992 ; CCP4 , 1994 ) . An initial set of 10 out of 16 possible selenium positions was determined from the anomalous differences of the ‘absorption peak’ data using SnB v2 . 1 ( Weeks and Miller , 1999 ) . Five additional positions , including that of the initial Met residue of chain A , were located by SOLVE ( Terwilliger and Berendzen , 1999 ) and included in the phase calculation ( 30 – 2 . 2A˚ ) , followed by solvent ﬂattening using RESOLVE ( Terwilliger , 2002 ) . The resulting map was of a very good quality and allowed to unequivocally build the entire backbone ( chain tracing using ARP / WARP ( Morris et al , 2002 ) combined with manual building in O ( Jones et al , 1991 ) ) , except for two residues at the C - terminus of both chains A and B , and two N - terminal residues that arose from the expression construct . Side chains were added manually and the model was reﬁned ( CNS 1 . 1 ( Bru¨nger et al , 1998 ) , REFMAC5 ( Murshudov et al , 1997 ) ) against the peak wavelength data restrained by experimental phases . Several rounds of manual rebuilding interspersed with reﬁnement lowered the free R - factor ( 5 % of reﬂections ) to 29 . 5 % , at which point water molecules were added . Met residues were modelled as seleno - methionine , whereby the free R values were only marginally different when using sulphur – methionine instead . This probably reﬂected the fact that at present anomalous scattering factors cannot be modelled in the CCP4 distribution of REFMAC5 ( Murshudov et al , 1997 ) . Density for loops 2 – 3 is weak and a number of side chains in this region could not be built with conﬁdence , in particular in chain A . The ﬁnal model comprises 496 protein residues ( 248 each in chains A and B ) and 221 water molecules . Temperature factors were reﬁned applying a TLS correction ( Winn et al , 2001 ) ( two groups ) and the minimisation converged to a free R value of 26 . 7 % with excellent stereochemistry ( Table I ) . Sedimentation velocity Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out in a Beckman XL - A analytical ultracentrifuge ( Beckman Coulter , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) equipped with absorbance optics . Protein samples were dialysed into storage buffer as above including 1mM DTT and loaded into cells with two channel Epon centre pieces and quartz windows . Data were recorded at 40000r . p . m . , 20 1 C , using an An50Ti rotor and an absorbance wavelength of 280nm , with scans taken every 6min . Solvent density was measured using an Anton Paar DMA 5000 high - precision density metre . Partial speciﬁc volumes were calculated using the program SEDNTERP ( Laue et al , 1992 ) . Data were analysed using the program SEDFIT ( Schuck , 2000 ) . Sedimentation coefﬁcient distributions were calculated using the Lamm equation modelling implementing maximum entropy regularisation . A total of 95 scans for each sample were analysed , representing the full extent of sedimentation of the sample . For the wild - type sample , data were ﬁtted to a single species model using ﬁnite element solutions to the Lamm equation ( Schuck , 1998 ) . F - actin - binding and F - actin - bundling assays G - actin was puriﬁed from rabbit muscle as described previously ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) . G - actin was maintained in G - buffer : 2mM Tris – Cl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 5mM DTTand 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 . Polymerisation of the actin was achieved by addition of 50mM KCl , 2mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 1mM EGTA , the resulting buffer being F - buffer . Concentrations measures given for F - actin in this paper refer to the initial concentration of G - actin prior to polymerisation . Plasmid constructs of wild - type and mutant forms of IMD were cloned into the pGEX4T2 expression vector and transformed into E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells and puriﬁed as described in the above section . Proteins were dialysed against F - buffer and centrifuged at 435000 g for 60min at 4 1 C , immediately prior to use in actin - binding / bundling experiments . Protein concentrations were measured using the Biorad protein assay and conﬁrmed by SDS – PAGE analysis . Actin - binding experiments . F - actin ( 2 . 5 m M ) was incubated with a range of concentrations ( 0 . 5 – 10 m M ) of either wild - type or mutant IMD in F - buffer for 30min on ice , and then centrifuged at 350000 g ( 30min , 4 1 C ) . Supernatants were removed , pellets rinsed with F - buffer then resuspended in a volume of F - buffer equal to that of the supernatant . Samples were analysed by SDS – PAGE and Coomassie staining , and quantiﬁed by densitometry using GENETOOLS ( Syngene ) , and normalised with respect to the F - actin band intensity . Actin - bundling experiments . F - actin ( 5 m M ) was incubated with varying concentrations of either wild - type or mutant IMD in F - buffer at room temperature for 1h , and then centrifuged at 16000 g for 30min at room temperature . Supernatants were removed and pellets resuspended in a volume of F - buffer equal to that of the supernatant . Fluorescence microscopy of actin bundling . Rabbit muscle G - actin was labelled using FluoroLink Cy3 - reactive dye ( Amersham Biosciences ) as described previously ( Machesky and Hall , 1997 ) . This was mixed with unlabelled G - actin , such that 15 % of monomers carried the Cy3 label . The actin was polymerised and varying concentrations of the labelled F - actin was mixed with varying concentrations of wild - type and mutant IMD in F - buffer and incubated at room temperature for 1h . The samples were then mounted between a slide and coverslip and imaged by ﬂuoresence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioskop2 and Hamamatsu C47442 - 95 camera . Images were processed using Openlab ( Improvision ) and Photoshop 7 . 0 ( Adobe ) . Cell culture COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium containing 10 % foetal calf serum and antibiotics . Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and transfected 24h later using Gene Juice ( Novagen ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . At 24h after transfection , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformalehyde and permeabilised in PBS containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . Cells were stained with TRITC – phalloidin ( Sigma ) and anti - myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 ( obtained from Cancer Research , UK ) , followed by an anti - mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 ( Molecular Probes ) .
