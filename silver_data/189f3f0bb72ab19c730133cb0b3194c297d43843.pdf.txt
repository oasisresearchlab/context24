SUNY – Buffalo State State University of New York International Center for Studies in Creativity Creative Products in a Service Industry : A look into the Health Insurance Industry A Project In Creative Studies By Aaron M . Lepsch Submitted in Partial Fulfillment Of the Requirements For the Degree of Master of Science December 2013 Creative Product in Health Insurance 2 ABSTRACT OF A PROJECT Creative Products in a Service Industry : A look into the Health Insurance Industry The purpose of this project is to look into products within the health insurance industry within New York State and determine whether current models can identify whether the insurance products are creative . With the advent to healthcare exchanges starting January 1 , 2014 , the healthcare industry is making tremendous changes within the industry . Federal and State regulators are mandating more coverage , implementing more rules and regulations as well with standardizing products . Due to this standardization , how might you classify one insurer’s product more creative to another insurer with the exact same product ? Models like the Creative Product Analysis Model ( CPAM ) and Consensual Assessment Technique ( CAT ) provide a framework to assess whether a product may be deemed creative . This project looks into current models to measure creative products and discussion occurs whether these models are sufficient . Questions and future research are identified within the project for future work .

In addition to determining whether the health insurance products may be creative , discussion will occur about current models and assessments that analyze the creativity of products and how these models and assessments for creative products may not suffice for such a heavily regulated business like health insurance . Health insurance products are not a normal consumable like ketchup or mustard . Health insurance products tend to be complex products made up of services and benefits which a member may or may not utilize . Description Health insurance products affect a vast majority of the U . S . population . Starting January 1 , 2014 , every citizen of the U . S . must have health insurance or face tax penalties under the Affordable Care Act that President Obama passed in 2010 ( PPACA , 2013 ) . Health Insurance may be obtained through what the government is calling “health care exchanges . ” The U . S . government has its own exchange . States also had the ability to create their own exchange , for example , New York that decided to create its own healthcare exchange to meet the federal mandate . This project looks at the New York State Exchange , which is formally called , “NY State of Health” ( New York State of Health , 2013 ) . Single and family coverage may be obtained for individuals and small group employers . My project focuses on the individual market within the Creative Product in Health Insurance 8 Buffalo area , where any New York resident within the Western New York area may obtain health insurance at their own discretion . My review mainly consists of what the New York Department of Financial Services calls “Standard Plans” ( Standard benefit design cost sharing description chart , 2013 ) . Discussions around non - standard plans occur , but the framework for discussion is around how a regulated product that has standard benefits may be creative to the individual considering purchasing the plan . I looked at the benefits and designs that New York State has dictated and compared them against current creative models that are used to identify how products are creative . The two models that are used for discussion are the Creative Product Analysis Model ( CPAM ) by Susan P . Besemer ( 2006 ) and the second model is the Consensual Assessment Technique ( CAT ) by Teresa M . Amabile ( Amabile , 1982 ) . These two models vary in approach on how to assess creative products , but the constructs in which products are determined creative are quite similar . The health insurance products discussed in this project are from several health insurance carriers that decided to participate in the exchange . These insurance carriers received New York State approval for their plan designs to be sold on the New York State Exchange . The products and information discussed will be applicable to only New York State , but cost structure to the member will be particular to the Buffalo , New York market . Literature was reviewed for both the health insurance market in New York , but I also reviewed health insurance statistics across America . I focused my project on a particular set of offerings , but the principal behind the health care exchanges are similar across the board in Creative Product in Health Insurance 9 New York State and America . Literature was reviewed on the structure of the two creative product assessment models . Descriptions of each model are provided along with statistics that explain the validity and reliability of each model . Questions around how the creative product models apply to the health insurance products are discussed . The questions will are created to discover gaps of identifying the creativity of each product . Questions are examined to determine whether the models have all the applicable tools and structure to measure the creativity of the health insurance products . Through the examination and breakdown of the creative product models and health insurance products , further items are identified for plausible answers , identified gaps , areas of limitation and the potential for future research . Discussions around questions , gaps , limitations and future research are identified . Next steps are identified for each item of discussion . Rationale for Selection Why did I choose Creative Product ? During my studies at the International Center for Studies in Creativity , I was always fascinated by the literature around creative products . Through my tenure at the program , I noticed a large gap in research . There has been a lot of research around creative person , creative process and the creative environment , but there was a gap in quantity of research around creative product . The gaps in research made me want to dig further into creative product and understand why this subject has not been reviewed more often . Creative Product in Health Insurance 10 Besides the gaps of research , I am a fanatic for products in general . I am a person that enjoys taking things apart and understanding how they work . I often enjoy reviewing and understanding how similar products are different from one another and like to examine how each function may give it an advantage on the competition and influence an individual to purchase the product over another competitor’s product . Products influence our lives every day . It may be as simple as the quality of brew in our coffee machine , to the plethora of options we may have in our vehicles that we purchase . These products may assist us with our daily activities , nourish us for the daily grind , and represent who we are as individuals . Reasons like the above are why I am so motivated and passionate for understanding what makes a product creative . Besides understanding what makes a product creative , I am also fascinated to see how these products change our lives . I often think of inventions like the printing press , telephone , computer and internet . Not only did the inventors feel that there was a need for this invention , but they saw an opportunity to change the world . These inventions created a legacy for the inventors , created companies to sell the products and gave consumers another way to make their lives more efficient and easier . Creative Product in Health Insurance 11 Why did I choose Health Insurance Products ? I chose the health insurance industry due to my exposure and experience as a Product Manager for HealthNow New York Inc . HealthNow sells individual and group insurance to employers and individuals throughout New York State . HealthNow is a health insurer headquarted in the Buffalo , New York area that sells health insurance under the brands of BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York , BlueShield of Northeastern New York and HealthNow New York Inc . ( HealthNow New York Inc . , 2013 ) . As a Product Manager , I was directly involved in the implementation of healthcare reform for my company . My team and I created health insurance products for the New York State Exchange . These products include some of the products that will be discussed in the proceeding sections of this project . My understanding of the health insurance market in New York and my experience as a Product Manager increased my motivation and passion for creative products . The experience of creating and implementing these products has made me take a step back and look at what both New York State and my company wish to do for the future of healthcare in the state . I want to understand how the market will react to our changes along with understanding how the products HealthNow releases will affect the choice and lives of the people we serve . During my research and work , I wanted to see how I might incorporate creativity into the marketplace for consumers to become educated about health insurance and use their benefits to their maximum potential . Creative Product in Health Insurance 12 Health Insurance is something that everyone will use or wished they would have had in their lifetime ( Kelly , 2013 ) . Health Insurance products are distinctive in the realm of products since it performs multiple benefits for the individual using the product . Health insurance products are not your typical consumable or service that one would receive . Health Insurance products can provide benefits for wellness , provide access to doctors to save your life and to make you feel financially comfortable and sound that you won’t have to pay your life savings because of a surgery . Creative Products and Health Insurance Because of the rapid change in America around health insurance and my experience as a Product Manager for a local health insurer , I felt it was necessary for me to review and compare how creative products and health insurance are linked together . Since every American will be forced to carry health insurance or face a penalty , I believe these products will have an ever growing impact on our lives . It will be important for consumers to be educated around what kind of insurance coverage they are purchasing . It will be important for health insurance companies to provide the tools and services to arm their members with the knowledge necessary to take control of their health . It will be important for our country to implement necessary rules and regulations to help curb the rapid growing cost of healthcare . If individuals , health insurers , hospitals , physicians and the government can work together , we can understand what kind of creative products that members will need to access their health insurance and use if effectively to maintain their health . Besides the necessary Creative Product in Health Insurance 13 collaboration between sectors , we first need to understand what makes a health insurance product creative . Creative Product Analysis Model ( CPAM ) and the Consensual Assessment Technique ( CAT ) may be a start to identify how a health insurance product is creative , but this is not the end . Further research needs to be conducted for healthcare products and creative products in order to further grow the opportunity to educate members and reduce unnecessary costs for ourselves , our government and our health insurers .

The areas of importance were identified to ensure that my review of creative products and health insurance products on the New York State Exchange are sufficient to support my findings . The following sections will be used to supplement my findings and were used to influence my work on this project . Creative Product What is a Creative Product ? One might say , creativity in products is in the eyes of the beholder . Consumers often walk in with an expectation of what they want in the product ( Besemer , 2006 , pg . 29 ) . People might say that a product is creative because it looks clean and neat . You might have someone say that the product is creative because if fixes issues in half the time of competitors products . You might have someone say that the product is the first of its kind and no one has ever created something like this . Each answer may be deemed creative and it’s up to the user to determine the creativity of the product based on the user’s knowledge , preferences , likes and dislikes that they have . If the person using the product thinks it is creative , then the company probably met its obligation for what they wanted to provide to the consumer . However , everyone has their own definition of creativity . In addition , what is creative to one individual may not be creative to another individual . Creative Product in Health Insurance 15 Susan P . Besemer and Teresa M . Amabile tried to capture what defines a creative product . Both researchers created assessments to try and determine the level of creativity a product may have . These models and assessments are great foundations of work to use . However , models and assessments should always be tested and tuned by additional research and refinement . There should never be an end when it comes to building of off prior findings and create something new or refined from previous work . The Creative Product Analysis Model ( CPAM ) The Creative Product Analysis Model ( CPAM ) began in 1981 when Susan P . Besemer and Donald J . Treffinger published the first iteration of the model . Besemer’s research categorized dimensions of creativity in products ( Besemer , & Treffinger , 1981 ) . Besemer’s created an assessment to supplement her model , it is called the Creative Product Semantic Scale ( CPSS ) ( Besemer , & O’Quin , 1986 ) . The dimensions of the CPAM have been refined over the years and currently follow the categorization of dimensions as Novelty , Resolution and Style ( Besemer , 2006 ) . Style was originally referred to as Elaboration and Synthesis . Novelty is categorized as how new a product is to the individual . Resolution is categorized as how the well the product solves a problem or challenge it was meant for . Style is categorized as how aesthetically pleasing it is to the individual ( Besemer , 2006 ) . Similar references to these dimensions may be found in discussions around creative product and aesthetic elements by David Cropley and Arthur Cropley ( 2008 ) and how to assess product engineering creativity ( Kobe , 2009 ) . Creative Product in Health Insurance 16 Within these three dimensions of CPAM , there are subset items of each dimension . Novelty has two subsets , which are how original and surprising the product may be to the user . Resolution has four subsets , which are how logical , useful , valuable and understandable the product may be to the user . Resolution has three subsets , which are how organic , well crafted and elegant the product is to the user ( Besemer , 2006 ) . The below figure breaks the CPAM model out in more detail : Figure 1 : The Creative Product Analysis Model ( CPAM ) NOVELTY The extent of newness in the product : In terms of the number and extent of new processes , new techniques , new concepts included RESOLUTION The degree to which the product fits or meets the needs of the problematic situation STYLE The degree to which the product combines unlike elements into a refined , developed , coherent whole , statement or unit ORIGINAL The product presents unexpected or unanticipated information to the user , listener , or viewer LOGICAL The product or solution follows the acceptable and understood rules for the discipline ORGANIC The product has a sense of wholeness or completeness about it . All the parts “work well” together SURPRISING The product is unusual or infrequently seen in a universe of products made by people with similar experience and training USEFUL The product has clear practical applications WELL CRAFTED The product has been worked and reworked with care to develop it to its highest possible level for this point in time VALUABLE The product is judged worthy because it fills a financial , physical , social , or psychological need ELEGANT The product shows a solution that is expressed in a refined , understated way UNDERSTANDABLE The product is presented in a communicative , self - disclosing way , which is “user - friendly” Besemer , S . P . ( 2006 ) . Creating products in the age of design . Stillwater , OK : New Forums Press . Pg . 198 . Creative Product in Health Insurance 17 The CPSS had a number of revisions over the years as well . When Besemer first created the assessment , it was a 110 item checklist that used a four point scale to rate the products creativity ( Besemer , 1997 ) . In 1989 , the CPSS was reduced to a 55 item checklist ( Besemer , 1997 ; Besemer , & O’Quin , 1989 ) . The current CPSS has 55 items with contrasting adjectives that are used on a Likert scale from one to seven . The assessment takes approximately ten minutes to complete and comes in multiple languages ( Ideafusion , 2013 , October 20 ) . The CPAM and CPSS have gone through multiple studies where Besemer and other researchers have tested the reliability and validity of her model and the assessment ( Besemer , 1989 , 1997 , 1998 , 2006 ; White , 2001 ) . The research has shown the CPSS is reliable and that the three dimensions and eleven subscales of the CPAM are valid . The CPSS assessment may be used in a variety of applications to assess how creative a product may be . One example of how the assessment may be used was done in a study that compared three chairs ( Besemer , 1998 ) . The study used naïve judges and showed that participants differed among their considerations for what they thought was creative . This study confirmed that the CPAM and CPSS holds a good amount of reliability and validity around its dimensions to identify a creative product . The judges had no training or expertise in the field to make be regarded as an expert . One example where the CPAM and CPSS were used by another individual for a study was in White and Smith’s study on Advertising ( 2001 ) . This study used both naïve judges and experts within the advertising industry . Students consistently gave the highest ratings for creativity , where the experts consistently game the lowest rating for creativity . The general Creative Product in Health Insurance 18 public usually split the middle between the students and experts . The study shows that both naïve judges and expert judges may assess the creativity of a product accurately based upon the constructs of the assessment . Since most products are used for the purposes of a company or organization to make some kind of revenue , Besemer understood that the CPSS should be identified for use in business applications . Besemer identified that the assessment and model is best used for testing for marketability , testing product design , addressing product improvement areas , advertising , and team processes . Besemer also said that the CPSS may be used for screening ideas , diagnosing brand problems , and competition analysis ( Besemer , & O’Quin , 2006 ) . Besemer explains that through using the CPSS , the assessment will identify gaps and concerns that may need to be addressed . This would allow organizations to identify challenges and fix problems that occur through the findings of the CPSS . The Consensual Assessment Technique ( CAT ) Theresa Amabile has had a vast amount of research and experience in creativity . Amabile has focused a good portion of her work around motivation , but has research , a model and an assessment to identify creative products ( Amabile , 1997 ) . For example , studies conducted by Amabile have shown that reward based incentives often inhibits the creative process and that someone who was given free choice and motivation to complete the task without any rewards are often more creative ( Amabile , 1997 ) . Amabile believes creativity is the fruition of expertise , creative skills and task motivation working together . For example , an expert with motivation and training around creative skills , one could reasonably assume that a Creative Product in Health Insurance 19 higher rated creative product may be produced from the process rather than someone who didn’t have the motivation , expertise , tools and training to be creative . Amabile created an assessment called the Consensual Assessment Technique ( CAT ) , which uses a panel of experts to judge the creativity of product based on a scale of high to low creativity . Examples of the scale are a rating of one to five or a one to six . If a higher number is represented , the higher the amount of creativity in the product ( Amabile , 1982 ; Kaufman , 2008 ; Hickey , 2001 ) . The CAT is distinctive in the sense that it allows the expert to judge the creativity based on a subjective assessment of their expertise in the particular field of the product . The participants are asked to create some form of a product and then are judged by experts on their creation . Participants are given guidelines , but also given freedom to express themselves in a creative manner . Even though guidelines are set , no limitations are imposed in order to allow the participant free roam to create what they feel will answer the request . General examples of products that have been reviewed with this assessment are poems , musical compositions and paintings ( Kaufman , 2007 ; Hickey , 2001 ) . One of the downsides of this approach is that it takes time and there is typically a cost associated with gathering experts to judge works of products . In addition to the bias and cost of an expert judge , some of the studies that have reviewed CAT have found that novice judges provided reliable ratings that correlated with the expert ratings ( Kaufman , 2007 ; Kaufman , 2008 ) . Discussions have identified that further research should be conducted to test between novice and expert judges . Creative Product in Health Insurance 20 The CAT assessment has had several studies that were conducted to determine if the CAT was reliable and held the proper amount of validity . Each study that was reviewed confirmed that the CAT was both a reliable assessment the held the proper amount of validity ( Kaufman , 2007 ; Kaufman , 2008 ; Hickey , 2001 ) ) . Examples of studies conducted reviewed whether raters could reasonably agree on creativity across multiple products ( Kaufman , 2007 ) , whether expert and non - expert ratings would differ ( Kaufman , 2008 ) and whether multiple levels of experience would judge creativity of a product differently ( Hickey , 2001 ) . Each of the respective studies confirmed that CAT could provide a general consensus of creativity across multiple products , allowed reasonable agreement among products and showed that there were differences between ratings of experts and non - expert ratings . Creative Product and Process In the section above , I mentioned how Amabile identified creative processes and expertise may affect the outcome of a creative product . During my review of the literature , I found a study that used such thoughts of the creative process affecting the level of creativity along with domain specific knowledge having a direct impact on the level of creativity . The study found that both domain specific knowledge and the creative process have a positive correlation in the level of creativity of a product being produced . The products that they were reviewing were in the domain of information technology ( Zeng , 2011 ) . The individuals who worked on this study created their own general model of creative process , which is represented in the figure below : Creative Product in Health Insurance 21 Figure 2 : Model of creative process and perceived value by the consumer Note : from Zeng , L . , Proctor , R . W . , & Salvendy , G . ( 2011 ) . pg . 247 ) . The above figure identifies key aspects that Amabile mentions to influence motivation in creativity . Zeng mentions that expertise should be categorized , a creative process is used , along with having the motivation of goals and context in which you want to solve the challenge . Arthur Cropley and David Cropley provided a similar model to the one discussed above , which confirms a similar process towards approaching creative product and process ( Cropley , & Cropley , 2008 . ) Creative Product and Style Another area of interest during my review of creative product literature was around style . I thought it would be interesting to reference how an individual’s style may influence how creative a product may be judged . Puccio and Treffinger used the Kirton adaptor - innovator theory to examine style . This theory identifies a cognitive style preference towards creativity . Innovator is categorized as someone that liked constant change and high degrees of novelty , in Creative Product in Health Insurance 22 the sense of originality . Adaptor is categorized someone that liked minimal change with less amounts of surprising characteristics to the novelty of the creativity ( Puccio , & Treffinger , 1995 ) . What Puccio and Treffinger found was the adaptors were more likely to be concerned around creating products that would solve a problem . Innovators were more focused on creating products that would exhibit high levels of novelty . These findings were value neutral . Puccio and Treffinger did state the further research should be done since this is a preference and that someone could be pushed towards the opposite end of the continuum if the need arose . Creative Product and Culture One of the gaps goes untouched when it comes to creative products is the cultural differences that a product may bring to a market . If the product is offensive from a cultural perspective , it may be stagnant in terms of sales to consumers . A study done by Levickaitė discusses how industries and economies are tied to each other from a cultural perspective . Levickaitė talks about how creative industries often embrace the culture in which they are working and tend to be the backbone of the economy ( Levickaitė , 2012 ) . A study was not conducted in this article , but Levickaitė discussed points that should be researched and reviewed further . Rasa Levickaitė captures this in the following statement , “If culture is perceptible in the anthropological or functional sense , one might use the concept of the cultural product” ( Levickaitė , 2012 , pg . 256 ) . Creative Product in Health Insurance 23 Health Insurance Products Health Insurance creates products that allow consumers to access healthcare from physicians and facilities to maintain and take care of someone’s health . These products are not like normal consumable goods , but they are complex products that bring in a mix of service and care for the consumer . No research or studies were found to relate current creative product assessments to health insurance products . What is Health Insurance ? Health Insurance is the process of insuring that the premiums paid by a pool of people and / or organizations sufficiently cover the medical expenses incurred among the individuals enrolled in the insurance ( Glossary of Health Coverage and Medical Terms , 2013 ) . Health Insurance products offer a defined benefit structure that the member may utilize to obtain healthcare services from hospitals and providers . There are multiple product designs , which will be discussed in proceeding sections . Health Insurance provides coverage for services that may range from wellness benefits like a gym membership to important emergency room visits that may save someone’s life that is in critical care . Healthcare offers a different perspective into products since it provides services , but must protect itself from risk of unnecessary medical expenses by members , providers and hospitals . In addition , health insurance products are often not completely understood by members and providers . There are multiple levels of coverage and costs are often incurred by all three parties ; the insurer , the member and the provider ( Austin , 2010 ) . Creative Product in Health Insurance 24 Health Insurance companies originated in the 1930’s and have evolved over the decades that followed . The spur for health insurance occurred due to the great depression that followed the market crash in 1929 . Efforts to abide by medical guidelines created organizations to adopt the BlueCross and BlueShield symbol to represent adhering to American Hospital Association ( AHA ) guidelines ( Austin , 2010 ) . Over the decades , federal and state sponsored programs grew to provide employees with comprehensive coverage for medical benefits . Examples include programs like Medicare and Medicaid programs . These programs are still in use today and are commonly discussed due to the rising cost of healthcare . Common Terms For the purposes of my discussion in the proceeding sections , definition of terms are essential to understand language used in the healthcare industry . Since the signing of the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) in 2010 by President Barack Obama , standardization has been sought by all federal and state regulators . The terms defined in this section are a reference to a glossary that the federal government demands be used by insurers when providing plan benefits to members ( Glossary , 2013 ; Glossary of Health Coverage and Medical Terms , 2013 ) . For further definitions , please reference appendix A .  Co - insurance Member share of the costs of a covered health care service , calculated as a percent ( for example , 20 % ) of the allowed amount for the service . Member pays co - insurance plus any deductibles they owe . For example , if the health insurance or Creative Product in Health Insurance 25 plan’s allowed amount for an office visit is $ 100 and they’ve met the deductible , the member’s co - insurance payment of 20 % would be $ 20 . The health insurance or plan pays the rest of the allowed amount .  Co - payment A fixed amount ( for example , $ 15 ) a member pays for a covered health care service , usually when a member receives the service . The amount can vary by the type of covered health care service .  Deductible The amount the member owes for health care services that the member’s health insurance or plan covers before the member’s health insurance or plan begins to pay . For example , if the member’s deductible is $ 1000 , the plan won’t pay anything until the member has met their $ 1000 deductible for covered health care services subject to the deductible . The deductible may not apply to all services .  Excluded Services Health care services that the health insurance or plan doesn’t pay for or cover .  Health Insurance A contract that requires the member’s health insurer to pay some or all of the member’s health care costs in exchange for a premium .  Hospitalization Creative Product in Health Insurance 26 Care in a hospital that requires admission as an inpatient and usually requires an overnight stay . An overnight stay for observation could be outpatient care .  In - Network Contracts with doctors , hospitals , labs , etc . to provide health services to its customers . This group of health care professionals forms a network . Customers usually pay less when they use these in - network health care professionals .  Medically Necessary Health care services or supplies needed to prevent , diagnose or treat an illness , injury , condition , disease or its symptoms and that meet accepted standards of medicine .  Network The facilities , providers and suppliers your health insurer or plan has contracted with to provide health care services .  Non - Preferred Provider A provider who doesn’t have a contract with your health insurer or plan to provide services to the member . The member will pay more to see a non - preferred provider . Members should check their policy to see if they can go to all providers who have contracted with their health insurance plan , or if their health insurance plan has a “tiered” network and the member must pay extra to see some providers . Creative Product in Health Insurance 27  Out - of - Network Health care professionals , hospitals , clinics and labs that do not belong to the network . Some plans provide coverage for services received from out - of - network health care professionals , but customers will typically pay more and might have to file a separate claim for payment .  Out - of - Pocket Limit The most a member pays during a policy period ( usually a year ) before the member’s health insurance plan begins to pay 100 % of the allowed amount . This limit never includes the member’s premium , balance - billed charges or health care that the member’s health insurance plan does not cover . Some health insurance or plans don’t count all of the member’s co - payments , deductibles , co - insurance payments , out - of - network payments or other expenses toward this limit .  Premium The amount that must be paid for the member’s health insurance or plan . The member and / or the member’s employer usually pay this monetary amount monthly , quarterly or yearly .  Primary Care Physician ( PCP ) A physician ( M . D . – Medical Doctor or D . O . – Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine ) who directly provides or coordinates a range of health care services for a patient . Creative Product in Health Insurance 28  Specialist A physician specialist focuses on a specific area of medicine or a group of patients to diagnose , manage , prevent or treat certain types of symptoms and conditions . A non - physician specialist is a provider who has more training in a specific area of health care . Note : Definitions adapted from Glossary , 2013 ; Glossary of Health Coverage and Medical Terms , 2013 . Cost of Health Insurance Over the past decades , healthcare costs have been rising much faster than inflation and employees wages . This has often created political debates on how to solve the growing problem in America . Local , state and federal regulators as well private insurance companies are trying to devise programs and strategies to address this concern . Medicare may be used as an example when referring to the healthcare cost discussion . In 1967 , it was anticipated that Medicare would cost $ 12 billion by 1990 . Actual Medicare costs were roughly $ 110 billion . That is a $ 98 billion dollar discrepancy that should be alarming to all regulators , insurers and members . Another statistic is commercial health insurance premiums rose four times faster than employees wages from the years of 1999 to 2007 ( Kelly , 2013 ) . The cost of healthcare is driven by items like the costs of medical services , the costs of prescription drugs , administration costs for the health insurer and mandated benefits that must be covered per federal and state regulators . Health insurers arrange agreements with these Creative Product in Health Insurance 29 providers , hospitals and pharmacies , but the cost may be much more than one would anticipate . For example , patients may be charge $ 18 for each diabetes test strip used , where if they were to go on Amazon , an individual may purchase a box of 50 test strips for $ 27 ( Stengel , 2013 ) . Healthcare costs in America often exceed costs in other countries . This statement often holds true for costs around both medical services and pharmaceutical drugs . For example , the price of one Lipitor pill in the U . S . is equivalent to purchasing three in Argentina . The cost of one Nexium pill in the U . S . is equivalent to purchasing eight in France . The cost of a Coronary Bypass is listed at $ 67 , 000 in the U . S . , where it is listed at $ 4 , 500 in India and $ 41 , 000 in Canada ( Stengel , 2013 ) . Health Insurance Products Health Insurance products may be broken up into many categories . Some of these categories include market , product type and product design . The market may determine what kind of product is sold and may restrict cost shares and plan designs to fit criteria set by both federal and state regulators . Product types will serve a group or individual with a particular need of healthcare services . This may range from a requirement of having a participating provider ( PCP ) or free roam to go see anyone you want in the pre - determined network . The plan design allows a group or individual to choose what kind of cost sharing parameters they want to pay for the healthcare services . One consistent item between plan designs is the fact that everyone has to pay a premium to the health insurer . Figure 3 below briefly describes some different product attributes : Creative Product in Health Insurance 30 Figure 3 : Healthcare Product Breakdown Note : Adapted from Health Insurance Basics , 2013 . In order to put the above figure into perspective , I will use federal and New York State classifications . New York State defines the individual market as people who seek out health insurance coverage for themselves or their family without the aid of an employer . Group insurance is broken out as small group and large group . Small group is an employer that has between 2 - 50 employees . Large group is an employer that has 50 employees or more ( Health Insurance Information for Insurers , 2013 ) . Product types will determine how you will use the plan and if there are strict rules as to providers and hospitals that you may visit for care . Health Maintenance Organizations ( HMO ) and Exclusive Provider Organizations ( EPO ) do not allow you to visit providers and hospitals that Creative Product in Health Insurance 31 are outside of the network . The difference between the two is that you must select a PCP for the HMO plan . EPO plans will allow a member to see any PCP that is in the plans network . Preferred Provider Organizations ( PPO ) and Point of Service ( POS ) plans offer out - of - network benefits to the member . However , the POS plan requires a member to select a PCP in order to receive care ( Health Insurance Basics , 2013 ) . Plan designs influence how you will pay for the services allowed under your health insurance plan . If you choose a copay plan , you will pay a fixed dollar amount for services . For example , if you go into the emergency room , you might expect to pay $ 100 for the visit . If you choose a coinsurance plan and go into the emergency room , you will pay a percentage of the total cost of the visit . For example , if the total cost of the emergency room visit is $ 1 , 000 and you have a coinsurance of 20 % , you would have to pay $ 200 for the visit . A blended design is a mix of both coinsurance and copay plans . For example , you may pay a copay for a visit to your PCP , but you may have to pay a coinsurance when you visit the hospital . Healthcare Exchanges Healthcare Exchange came about when President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 . The exchanges are to be implemented for small groups and individuals seeking health insurance on January 1 , 2014 and forward . There is a federal exchange for states that did not implement their own exchange . New York State opted in implement an exchange and has named it the New York State of Health ( New York State of Health , 2013 ) . The first healthcare exchange was implemented in Massachusetts per a state law put into effect in 2006 . This implementation provided data and framework for states like New York Creative Product in Health Insurance 32 and the federal implementation . For example , the federal implementation and all states will use plan designs classified at metal levels and will use an actuarial values to determine the metal level . The Massachusetts law has succeeded in reducing the amount of uninsured individuals and unnecessary hospitalizations for preventable illnesses ( Ericson , 2012 ) . New York State Exchange As described in the previous section , New York State has opted to implement an exchange and must abide by federal regulations of the ACA . The New York State of Health will provide a platform for health insurers to offer health insurance plans for individuals and small groups ( 2 - 50 subscribers ) on January 1 , 2013 . Enrollment began on October 1 , 2013 . Plans will be offered in the following format according to figure 4 . Creative Product in Health Insurance 33 Figure 4 : New York State of Health Plan Classification Exchange Products Platinum Member pays 10 % of health insurance costs Most expensive plan Gold Member pays 20 % of health insurance costs Silver Member pays 30 % of health insurance costs Eligible for subsidies for premium and cost assistance Bronze Member pays 40 % of health care costs Cheapest plan Note : Adapted from Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) , 2013 & Standard benefit design cost sharing description chart ( 5 - 6 - 2013 ) , 2013 . Plans offered by health insurers must meet several criteria . The first criterion addresses actuarial value . Actuarial value assesses a percentage value to which a member and the health plan pay for health care costs . These values are broken out in metallic values , which are identified as Platinum , Gold , Silver and Bronze . Platinum is described as plan in which the member will pay 10 % of healthcare costs and the insurer will bear 90 % of healthcare costs . Gold plans will embrace 20 % of healthcare costs for members , Silver plans will embrace 30 % of Creative Product in Health Insurance 34 healthcare costs for members and Bronze plans will embrace 40 % of healthcare costs for members ( Actuarial Value Calculator , 2012 ; Health Insurance Information for Insurers , 2013 ) . In addition to the above criteria , New York State reviewed the largest membership plans to identify essential health benefits ( EHB ) . EHB’s are benefits that must be provided by all plans in the New York State exchange . The largest plan in New York State was Oxford’s EPO plan , which was used to determine what benefits must be offered by all plans . This information was compiled by a organization called Milliman ( 2012 ) . Please reference appendix B for a list of all EHB’s . New York State also implemented what they called “model language” for all plans to use for the exchange . Model language provided a framework for all insurers to complete a legal document called a member certificate . A member certificate is a legal document that writes out what benefits , rules and regulations members have for their health insurance plan ( Model Language , 2013 ) . Please visit appendix C and D for examples of model language . These member certificates must be submitted by all insurers and must be approved by New York State Department of Financial Services . These submissions occur through a third party website called Serff ( Health Insurance Information for Insurers , 2013 ; Serff , 2013 ) . Creative Product in Health Insurance 35 Standard Plans When New York State created the framework for the exchange , they created a standard plan for each metal level . These plans all had the Essential Health Benefits ( EHB ) , but contained pre - determined cost sharing levels of copayments and coinsurance . Each insurer was required to offer these standard plans on the exchange if the insurer wished to participate in the exchange . This allowed a level playing field for members to choose pre - determined plans . The only thing insurers could control was the amount of premium that they could charge members and groups ( Standard , 2013 ) . Figure 5 below provides a high level overview of the standard plans . Please visit appendix E for a complete list of benefits for the standard plan designs . Figure 5 : Standard Plan Designs New York State Standard Plans Type of Service Platinum Gold Silver Bronze Deductible ( single ) $ 0 $ 600 $ 2 , 000 $ 3 , 000 Out - of - Pocket Maximum ( single ) $ 2 , 000 $ 4 , 000 $ 5 , 500 $ 6 , 350 PCP $ 15 $ 25 $ 30 50 % Specialist $ 35 $ 40 $ 50 50 % Inpatient $ 500 $ 1 , 000 $ 1 , 500 50 % Surgery $ 100 $ 100 $ 100 50 % Emergency Room $ 100 $ 150 $ 150 50 % Note : Adapted from Approved Monthly Premium Rates , 2013 . Creative Product in Health Insurance 36 All cost shares were determined by New York State and copayments were represented in a fixed dollar amount . Coinsurance was represented by a percentage . Deductible amounts were listed for single plans , but family deductible amounts are two times the single plan amount . Out - of - pocket maximum amounts were listed for single plans , but family out - of - pocket maximum amounts are two times the single plan amount ( Standard , 2013 ) . Since premiums were the only thing that insurers had control over , each plan had to assess the cost to their company through actuarial analysis . Actuaries must submit premium rates to New York State Department of Financial Services for approval as well . New York State published these rates and a high level overview is provided below in Figure 6 .

Creative Product in Health Insurance 37 The premium rates above are for standard plans in the Buffalo market . These rates are approved for standard plans offered on the New York State Exchange from January 1 , 2014 to December 31 , 2014 . It is important to note that the list did not state the brand that would be represented in the particular market . For Example , HealthNow would be branded as BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York in the Buffalo market ( Approved Monthly Premium Rates , 2013 ) . In addition , it is important to note that the above rates might differ from what you would find on the exchange . This is due to things like dependent coverage and amendments of what insurers wanted to offer on the exchange between the publications released by New York State and when the exchange was opened for enrollment ( Approved Monthly Premium Rates , 2013 ; New York State of Health , 2013 ) . Creative Product in Health Insurance 38 SECTION 3 : METHODOLOGY / PURPOSE The purpose of my project is to look at the literature of creative products and the literature around healthcare exchanges in New York State and combine them to see if current models and assessments are sufficient to assess whether health insurance products are creative . Before I looked at health insurance products , I reviewed products that may be deemed creative and evaluated whether CPAM and CAT are sufficient models to assess the products creativity . From there , I reviewed what are some aspects that makes consumers want to purchase products . Once that was done , I went into the healthcare exchange products in New York State and evaluated whether CPAM and CAT are sufficient models to assess the products creativity . Both Standard and Non - Standard products were reviewed . To Supplement the Non - Standard products , I reviewed some creative products in the healthcare industry today and how the fit into the New York State Exchange market . Three Successful Products I reviewed three products that are in use today and were successful in their respective markets . The three products are the Post - it Note , the Jawbone Wireless Headset and the Model 302 - F1 Telephone . These products were assessed by the authors on aesthetics , function , usability , sustainability and commercial success for each product . Each dimension was given a score of one to four ( Lidwell & Manacsa , 2009 ) . Creative Product in Health Insurance 39 Post - it Note The first product I reviewed is the Post - it Note . The Post - it Note was given a perfect score of 20 . The dimensions of aesthetics , function , usability , sustainability and commercial success scored a four out of four . This product was chosen since it is commonly used in the household , office and other places of personal and professional development . The Post - it Note allows an individual to write their ideas down and stick it on a surface . The great advantage of the Post - it Note is that it may be moved from place to place and still adhere to the surface it is placed on ( Lidwell & Manacsa , 2009 ) . Figure 7 : Post - it Note Note : Screen shot of Lidwell , & Manacsa , 2009 . If this product was reviewed by the CPAM and CAT creative products models , one would assume that the Post - it Note should achieve high scores since it was a revolutionary product that never existed before and has maintained great commercial success . The product has a high degree of novelty since it was the first of its kind . The product has a high level of resolution Creative Product in Health Insurance 40 since it solves the problem of writing your ideas down and having the usability to move it around as needed . Finally , the product comes in many shapes and sizes to allow for the user to pick the style that fits their needs . Jawbone Wireless Headset The second product I reviewed is the Jawbone Wireless Headset . The Jawbone Wireless Headset was given a score of 12 out of 20 . The dimension of aesthetics achieved a score of two , the dimension of function achieved a score of four , the dimension of usability achieved a score of one , the dimension of sustainability achieved a score of two and the dimension of commercial success achieved a score of three . This product was chosen since it is an example of a product that did not achieve higher scores in each respective dimension . The Jawbone Wireless Headset allows the user to take wirelessly from their cell phone or device without having to hold it to their head ( Lidwell & Manacsa , 2009 ) . Figure 8 : Jawbone Wireless Headset Note : Screen shot from Note : Screen shot of Lidwell , & Manacsa , 2009 . Creative Product in Health Insurance 41 If this product was reviewed by the CPAM and CAT creative products models , one would assume that the Jawbone Wireless Headset should achieve medium scores for creativity . The product has a medium degree of novelty since it is distinctive to the market and is a newer technology . The product has a high level of resolution since it solves the problem talking without cords and without having to hold a device to your head . Finally , the style of the product is symmetrical , but it is rugged since it is not round and pleasing to the eye when compared to most designs in the market today . Model 302 - F1 Telephone The third product I reviewed is the Model 302 - F1 Telephone . The Model 302 - F1 Telephone was given a score of 16 out of 20 . The dimension of aesthetics achieved a score of three , the dimension of function achieved a score of four , the dimension of usability achieved a score of two , the dimension of sustainability achieved a score of three and the dimension of commercial success achieved a score of four . This product was chosen since it is an example of a product that achieved higher scores in each dimension , but it is a technology that would necessarily not be applicable to the market in 2013 and beyond . The Model 302 - F1 Telephone allows the user to make phone calls to the number in which they dial ( Lidwell & Manacsa , 2009 ) . Creative Product in Health Insurance 42 Figure 9 : Model 302 - F1 Telephone Note : Screen shot from Note : Screen shot of Lidwell , & Manacsa , 2009 . If this product was reviewed by the CPAM and CAT creative products models , one would assume that the Model 302 - F1 Telephone should achieve different scores for creativity based on the context of the assessment . The Model 302 - F1 Telephone was released in 1938 and was meant for that time period . This allowed the user to call phone numbers . With the advent of touch screens and smart phones , this product is now obsolete in 2013 . If the assessment was given in the context of its time period , the product should be given a medium degree of creativity . The product has medium level of novelty since it was an adaption of a current invention , but made refinements to improve the product . The product has a high level of resolution since it solves the problem calling someone that may be a couple blocks away or on a different continent . Finally , the style of the product is medium - high for the time period since the shell was ergonomic and futuristic for the time period . Creative Product in Health Insurance 43 Influences to Purchasing Products The three products described above show how products can be creative in the sense of providing something innovative like the Post - it Note that was never created before and also how little changes in the telephone make people’s lives easier . However , creativity in the product does not mean that everyone will see their value and will purchase the products . There are many factors that go into a purchase decision , for example , people might have psychological factors to drive their purchase since they feel a need or a want for the product ( Besemer , 2006 ) . In addition to the psychological factors , people have socioeconomic factors that could drive purchase decisions . A product may fit well into a culture within the United States , but it may not fit well into a different culture that has different values ( Besemer , 2006 ) . Selecting the Right Product Organizations have a complicated decision to make in which they have to account for so many purchasing factors that could influence a customer to purchase their product . If organizations need to account for these factors , how do they choose what product to sell ? The product development process often tries to identify what customers are best suited for their product through market research and looking at specific aspects of each product . Organizations have to look at factors like utility , need , sales appeal advantages to competitor products , market size , patentability , research and development costs , setup costs , profit potential , sustainability , assessment of your competition , product life and compatibility of the product ( Arnold , 2010 ; Athma & Kumar , 2007 ; Kroll , Condoor , & Jansson , 2001 ; Niebel & Draper , 1974 ) . Each factor will assess whether the product is a viable choice to sell to Creative Product in Health Insurance 44 consumers and will provide the organization with a product that will be commercially successful along with achieving the mission and values of the company . If the product meets the necessary criteria , it could be seen to production , but there also may be many products that will never see the market or production line since it didn’t provide the necessary criteria to meet the organizations expectations . Insurance Products vs . Consumables Insurance products do not differ in the selection process of whether a product is a viable choice for the market in which they wish to sell . However , insurance products do have two features that bring in additional assessment of whether the product is viable . One feature that is additional to insurance products is the fact they have to weigh the risk of the individuals that will choose a product and assign a value to that risk that will meet all expenses . In addition to this feature , insurance is a product that receives premiums from its members rather than a normal consumable that you purchase and then own once the exchange has been completed . This premium needs to be assessed as to whether the consumer can afford the coverage of the product . How Health Insurance Products Evolved Health insurance products have evolved over the years and within the past decade , there has been multiple new innovations to try and mitigate costs and put the consumer in a place to manage their health more effectively . Examples of how the industry has changed are the introduction of Medicare and Medicaid programs in the late 1950’s , the introduction of health maintenance organizations ( HMO’s ) in the 1970’s , high deductible health plans ( HDHP ) Creative Product in Health Insurance 45 in the early 2000’s and recent advent of tiered - network products ( Austin & Hungerford , 2010 ; Regopoulos , Christianson , Claxton & Trude , 2006 ) . Each of these innovations is different and provides a change that tried to cater to particular demographic of individuals . Medicare and Medicaid products are programs that are regulated by the federal and state government . Medicare products are for individuals that are at the age of 65 or older . Medicaid products are for individuals who are disabled and meet the qualifications for the program . HMO’s are products that promote care to be directed by your physician ( PCP ) . HDHP plans are plans that require a member to pay a higher deductible before cost sharing requirements are introduced , but allow members to contribute funds to a health savings account ( HSA ) or health reimbursement arrangements ( HRA ) . Tiered - network products try to influence coordination of care between the insurance company , physician , hospital and member through a partnership to reduce unnecessary expenses and provide higher quality of care ( Austin & Hungerford , 2010 ; Regopoulos , Christianson , Claxton & Trude , 2006 ) . Each change in the insurance industry provides the same resolution to the health insurance products . All the changes described above provide healthcare products to the members , which allow them to seek services to maintain their health and / or save their lives . Styles of the health insurance products are controlled by how the insurers market the products to members . The insurers try to create marketing messages and materials that provide a sense of an organic message that is well crafted , along with providing elegant marketing materials that spread the message . Novelty of each product may be the greatest indicator of the products creativity . Each innovation in the industry was created to allow members to take advantage of Creative Product in Health Insurance 46 new programs and provide members with tools that would allow them to take more control over their health . Healthcare exchanges that will be implemented on January 1 st , 2014 will bring a new dynamic to the industry . The exchange allows individuals and small employer groups to shop for health insurance through a website . The individuals and small employer groups will have the ability to review plans and compare prices . This was not previously available in the health insurance industry . This advent brings a sense of novelty to the products and provides the resolution of providing insurance to individuals that could not previously purchase insurance . Each product has a particular type of style through branding of the company and what type of cost sharing arrangements that the product offers . Standard Exchange Products Standard Exchange products are different than normal health insurance products that are offered today . These products are heavily regulated by New York State . The state advises the insurers that they have to offer these products if they wish to participate in a market , the state controls the benefits that are offered and also controls the cost shares that may be administered for all benefits ( Health Insurance Information for Insurers , 2013 ; Milliman , 2012 ) . The state controls each plan design for each metal level . They have plan designs for Platinum , Gold , Silver , Bronze and Catastrophic . To see the standard plan designs , please visit appendix E . These designs may not have cost sharing requirements amended by any health insurer . This allows customers to have set level of benefits to choose in each “metal” level . In addition to choosing the cost share for the benefits , every insurer must cover the same benefits Creative Product in Health Insurance 47 to fulfill the essential health benefits clause of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) ( Milliman , 2012 ; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) , 2013 ) . These restrictions do not allow health insurers a lot of flexibility to create products that are different from the competition . The two areas to differentiate the product are the price of each product by each competitor and then the brand that the company holds with the market in which they are selling . This removes all novelty from the product since each product is the same along with all resolution as the products solve the same problem . Style is also restricted since insurers are regulated as to what marketing materials they may put on the New York State website ( New York State of Health , 2013 ) . The following figures show the New York State Exchange and how a member may look at plans : Creative Product in Health Insurance 48 Figure 10 : The home page for the New York State of Health Note : Screen shot from New York State of Health , 2013 . The screen shot above captures the current home page of the New York State exchange . This is where small group employers and individuals will begin their shopping by logging into their account and / or creating an account to begin the shopping process . Resources are also available for members to review as well with a phone number to talk to a live person . Creative Product in Health Insurance 49 Figure 11 : Filtering criteria to search for health plans Note : Screen shot from New York State of Health , 2013 . The screen shot above illustrates the search function for an individual searching for a health insurance plan . Individuals may filter by premium costs , metal level , health insurer , doctors , facilities and quality rating . These filters will then show the plans that meet the desired criteria . Creative Product in Health Insurance 50 Figure 12 : Screen shot of health plans available in the Buffalo area Note : Screen shot from New York State of Health , 2013 . The screen shot above illustrates plans that are currently available for purchase in 2014 within the Buffalo area . Various health insurers have their company logo on the left , followed by premium , metal level , quality rating , whether they have out - of - network coverage and the deductible costs . Each plan may be chosen to view further information about the plan by clicking on the buttons on the far right . Creative Product in Health Insurance 51 Figure 13 : Screen shot of a platinum plan detail from BlueCross BlueShield of WNY Note : Screen shot from New York State of Health , 2013 . The screen shot above illustrates a breakout of a single health insurance plan on the exchange . The health plan chosen above is from BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York . The breakout of the plan will contain further cost sharing information , along with a description of what the services denote . Non - Standard Exchange Products New York State also allows insurers to create their own plan designs as well . However , they must meet an actuarial value metal level of platinum , gold , silver or bronze . Health insurers in New York State were not required to create non - standard plan designs , but most Creative Product in Health Insurance 52 health insurers did create non - standard in order to differentiate themselves in the market place ( New York State of Health , 2013 ) . One item that is the same among all health insurers and their non - standard plan designs are that they have to offer the essential health benefits as mandated per PPACA . This means that all benefits are the same among the non - standard plans , but the insurers were allowed to affect cost share requirements , network requirements and price . Health Insurers could also offer health savings accounts ( HSA ) if the plan met the IRS guidelines to offer the tax free savings account . Two of the largest health insurers in the Buffalo , NY areas offered non - standard plan designs with a tiered network . These health insurers were BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York and Independent Health ( Individual and Family Plans , 2013 ; Small Group Plans , 2013 ) . Typically , health insurance products have in - network benefits and out - of - network benefits . A tiered product has two levels of in - network benefits with different cost sharing requirements in each tier . The reason for the different tiers is to financially draw members to physicians , hospitals and facilities in which they will coordinate the care of the members more effectively and help reduce costs . Figure 14 below shows an example of BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York non - standard plan designs . Full summaries of benefits for some non - standard plan designs may be found in appendix E . Creative Product in Health Insurance 53 Figure 14 : Non - standard plan designs for BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York Note : Individual and Family Plans , 2013 The screen shot above illustrates non - standard exchange plans that are offered by BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York in the Buffalo region . The screen shot is from the website of BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York . The top of the figure denotes the products name and metal level . The rows of each column represent the premium for the plan , the cost sharing levels for various providers under Optimum and Flexible and the cost for prescription drugs . Further information about each plan is available under the shop plan button at the bottom of the page . Creative Product in Health Insurance 54 SECTION 4 : ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION Standard Products Since standard products on the exchange are fixed for benefits , cost sharing and information represented , how would Besemer’s CPAM model fair against assessing the creativity of the products ? The Novelty dimension of her model should not render a high score of novelty since most of the product’s attributes are fixed and are not drastically new product designs in the market place for health insurance . One would assume that a novelty score should be identical among products since they are essentially the same product from competitor to competitor . If the score is the same , one cannot conclude this dimension would be useful to differentiate the product among competitors . The products among the competitors solve the same problem and offer the same solution . This dimension should render the same score among competitor products since they are standardized . Style may be the only dimension that may differ to due someone’s feelings about the brand . The same information must be posted and represented in the same way as all competitors , so this does not allow much differentiation as well . Amabile’s CAT model should render similar results as well , since the only difference among competitors for these products are price and brand . Since the products are standardized throughout the market region within New York State , they should render similar scores among competitors . One may assume that scores would maybe differ from judge to judge based on personal experience and bias . Creative Product in Health Insurance 55 Non - Standard Products Non - Standard products on the healthcare exchange should render different scores when reviewing against the CPAM and CAT model . These products have the same benefits among all products and the products are represented the same way on the exchange for each competitor . However , health insurers may choose cost share requirements , network requirements and offer additional benefits like an health savings account ( HAS ) . Figure 15 below shows the different cost sharing requirements for the metal level of Gold . Figure 15 : Gold Non - Standard Plans Non - Standard Plans Health Carrier BlueCross Blue Shield of WNY Independent Health Type of Service Optimum Choice Flexible Choice Network A Network B Deductible ( single ) $ 50 $ 1 , 700 $ 1 , 000 $ 2 , 000 Out - of - Pocket Maximum ( single ) $ 6 , 350 $ 6 , 350 $ 5 , 000 $ 6 , 350 PCP 15 % 25 % $ 30 40 % Specialist 15 % 25 % $ 50 40 % Inpatient 15 % 25 % $ 500 40 % Surgery 15 % 25 % $ 150 50 % Emergency Room 15 % 15 % $ 150 $ 150 Note : Adapted from Individual and Family Plans , 2013 ; Small Group Plans , 2013 Resolution and style among the products should be similar among competitors since the information is represented the same way and these products solve the same problem . Creative Product in Health Insurance 56 However , novelty should be different for the products since the cost sharing requirements may draw attention to areas of the product design . For example , if you know that you’re going to see your doctor in the next month , you may not be comfortable paying a coinsurance since you don’t know what your doctor’s total charges might be . Someone may like the ability to know the total amount that they will have to pay for a service . Expert judges should also score similarly among other expert judges , but may score different than the normal individual since they are aware of how plan designs affect cost and other aspects of the insurance product . How the Health Insurance Exchange is Developing The federal exchange and all the state exchanges are fortunate to have a template to work from . Massachusetts implemented their exchange back in 2006 . The exchange has successfully reduced the amount of people who are uninsured along with reducing hospitalizations for preventable illness ( Marzilli & Starc , 2012 ) . Enrollees in the Massachusetts exchange often chose the cheapest plan . This often is the best way for someone to evaluate an insurance plan since most people are not familiar with the intricacies of health insurance and what their benefit coverage actually means ( Marzilli & Starc , 2012 ) . The implementation and enrollment of the exchanges for New York and the U . S . is currently underway . The first effective date of these plans will be on January 1 st , 2014 . Enrollment began on October 1 st , 2013 . The federal rollout of the exchanges has been a debacle to date and President Obama has faced major criticism throughout the country . Some reasons include website failures , increases in premiums for health insurance plans , and cancelled plans due to rules and regulations of PPACA ( Roy , 2013 ) . Creative Product in Health Insurance 57 New York State has been successful so far and accounts for a large amount of the enrollment in the country as of November 17 , 2013 . New York State did have issues with their website for the first couple days after October 1 st , 2013 , but the state quickly addressed issues and fixed the problems . Even though this system is supposed to make purchasing insurance easier for individuals and small employers , it is not as easy as purchasing a plane ticket or booking a hotel ( Mulder , 2013 ) . Influences to Purchase Based on the experience of the Massachusetts exchange , one might anticipate that enrollees will choose the cheapest plan more often than not . If price will be the driving factor for individuals to choose plans , this will often be plans that are in the Bronze metal level and / or a Catastrophic plan . However , this is not the only factor that will move individuals to choose a plan . Items like your health , age , education , and understanding of insurance and political views may sway your decisions on how to choose a plan . If you’re healthy , it is probably in your best interest to pick up a cheap plan since you will not use many services . If you’re unhealthy , you’ll probably be more likely to choose a plan that has lower copayments and out - of - pocket maximum . This will allow individuals to spend less out of their pocket , but will have a higher monthly premium . One benefit among all plans on and off the exchange is that they must cover routine services . These routine services are covered in full under PPACA . Preventive services range from an annual physical to lab tests to prevent conditions that may hospitalize you and may make you sick ( Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , 2013 ) . Creative Product in Health Insurance 58 If you’re older , you may be more willing to pay higher premiums . These plans often have the best coverage , in terms of copayments for services . In addition to paying a higher premium , these individuals may have been with one insurance company for years and will want to continue insurance under that company even though other companies are cheaper . This often provides individuals the “peace of mind” mentality . Since PPACA has made a big stir among the political parties , it is not uncommon to hear individuals say that they refuse to purchase health insurance on the exchange due to their political beliefs . Individuals do have the ability not to purchase insurance , but will have to pay a tax penalty for no insurance coverage ( Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , 2013 ) . Education and understanding of the health plans often play a big role in choice . If you don’t understand the plan you are purchasing , other factors may sway your choice more than it probably should ( Marzilli & Starc , 2012 ) . What Might be Other Ways to Measure Creative Products Based on the review of these insurance products and how they are regulated and presented to the public , CPAM and CAT may not be comprehensive enough to identify if all products may be deemed creative . The research has shown that the models are valid and reliable for consumer goods , but what about products like these health insurance products on healthcare exchanges ? If products are regulated and standardized to the point that novelty , resolution and style cannot successfully measure the products creativity , what might be the other aspects to measure the products creativity ? Is it as simple to measure the price of the product ? Does the Creative Product in Health Insurance 59 brand have more influence over purchasing under this scenario ? How might socioeconomic and psychological purchasing factors influence the decision on how the product is creative ? How might education around health insurance provide consumers with more insight to manage their health ? These are all questions that do not have answers at this point and further investigation and formal research should be conducted to assess whether my findings are accurate . Evolutionary Creativity vs . Revolutionary Creativity Every product that is introduced into their respective market may contain an amount of evolutionary creativity or revolutionary creativity . Evolutionary creativity represents a change that develops an existing product or construct and improves on the previous version . Revolutionary creativity represents a change that creates a new paradigm that has never been seen previously . The evolution of health insurance has seen many changes happen over recent decades . The implementation of health care exchanges represents a large change in the health insurance industry . Health care exchanges in America represent a revolutionary change since this construct was never previously available to the public , with the exception of the Massachusetts health care exchange . However , the products offered on these health care exchanges represent an evolutionary change . The products have not fundamentally changed and are an extension of existing paradigms . Creative Product in Health Insurance 60 SECTION 5 : SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS Summary Even though there are multiple ways to assess creativity of a product , there are limitations to which the product may be assessed . The creative product models of CPAM and CAT have a large amount of research to support their reliability and validity . CPAM and CAT are great ways to assess the creativity of a consumable product . However , a complicated product like a health insurance has multiple components that CPAM and CAT seem to miss . Assessing a creative product with the use of experts , users and dimensions like novelty , resolution and style provide a framework to follow . The CPAM and CAT models have been around for years and have undergone testing by the creators and outside resources to test the validity and reliability of their models . Most products tested under these assessments have been consumables , musical compositions , poems and paintings . During my findings , a review of insurance products to test their creativity was not found for CPAM and CAT . There are multiple questions that still remain to be reviewed and answered . These questions are fundamental to further dig into what makes a product creative . The possibility for further models and assessments allow an opportunity to grow the field of research around creative product . Such growth is necessary in order to for organizations to understand their consumer and provide products that meet the consumers needs and wants as well as achieving the organizations vision and mission . The growth is also necessary to assist the expansion of scholarly work around a topic that does not have as much volume as other areas of creativity . Creative Product in Health Insurance 61 Limitations This review of creative products and health insurance was a preliminary look into the matter . There are multiple limitations of this review . The limitations are around research and discussion points throughout this project . These limitations are opportunities to break out this subject into areas of further research . The first and largest research limitation of this project is the fact that no formal qualitative and quantitative research was conducted . Data were simply reviewed and assessed based on current available research . Further qualitative and quantitative research should be conducted around creative product and health insurance . The second limitation is the CPAM and CAT assessments were not used to assess whether the health insurance products were creative . Dimensions of each model that support these assessments were reviewed and discussed , but no qualitative and quantitative research was done to address whether these models may accurately detect creativity within health insurance products . Further studies should be conducted using these assessments to address whether they can detect the creativity of the health insurance product to a level of sufficient reliability and validity . The third limitation was the focused view on exchange products for New York State in the Buffalo region . There are exchange products throughout the United States that differ from that which is offered in the Buffalo region . Offerings in Buffalo also differ from offerings in the Albany area . A comprehensive look into exchange products would be able to identify trends throughout the country , but may also be skewed as different rules and regulations may be in Creative Product in Health Insurance 62 place by the state in which the product is being offered . In addition , health insurance products that are offered to large groups are not subject to the same rules and regulations of the healthcare exchange . These products may be a more complicated since groups typically pick their benefits and plan design offerings . The fourth limitation is the focused view on health insurance products . There are multiple areas of insurance , such as life , auto , pet , etc . These insurance industries have products that should be reviewed and assess whether CPAM , CAT and other models are sufficient to determine whether their products are creative . These products may not have the strict rules and regulations that health insurance products on the healthcare exchange have to conform to . The fifth limitation is the availability of information around the health insurance industry . More information is currently available on these health insurance products than previously seen by the public , but there is still a large amount of proprietary data that is not accounted for . This data allows the company to maintain competitive edges within their respective regions and also provide a framework in which they develop their strategies in which they create the health insurance products . The sixth limitation is around the availability of demographic information . This information is available to the insurance companies based on existing data within their company . This data allows the insurance company to determine rates based on the assumed risk that may be taken in by these plans . Actuarial analysis determines these costs , but the development of how Actuarial analysts create rates is not available to the public . This Creative Product in Health Insurance 63 information would allow the researcher to understand items like the health and risk of age groups , regions of the city and trends of diseases that are common among different groups . The seventh limitation is around the timing of this project . No historical information is available due to the fact that the exchange products are being rolled out as this paper is written . Further information around the success and failure of these health insurance products will be available in years of 2014 and beyond . This information will be key in determining trends and how products have changed to the situations that have come about . Recommendations The first recommendation is to test CPAM and CAT against health insurance products . If these models and assessments are tested in a study for these exchange products , quantitative data would be available to assess whether the models and assessments may predict the creativity of the health insurance product . The quantitative data would be a integral part to identify gaps in which further research should be conducted . The second recommendation is to test CPAM and CAT against insurance products within the insurance industry . A study like this would expand the review to products within insurance industries like life , auto , etc . The expansion into a different industry would be able to identify whether the CPAM and CAT are sufficient to identify creativity within these insurance products . The quantitative data would be an integral part to identify gaps in which further research should be conducted . In addition to identifying creativity within the products , it would allow someone to assess whether the same occurrences happens across insurance products or may be industry specific . Creative Product in Health Insurance 64 The third recommendation is to conduct further gap analysis between the models and assessments that try to identify creativity within products . Gap analysis will be critical to identify areas that need further research . These identified areas will determine where these models and assessments are not sufficient to determine creativity within products . The fourth recommendation is to conduct qualitative studies . The qualitative studies would allow understanding around the sticking points for what makes a health insurance product creative to the user . The data would be able to determine whether different backgrounds , culture and demographics affect how someone determines insurance products as creative . This research may uncover various gaps that had not been identified by the research around creative product . The fifth recommendation is to identify the need around new models and assessments for creative products . If the current models and assessments are not sufficient , how might we create a new model ? There is always the possibility to create new ways to assess creativity in products . A new model and assessment may bring about an additional step in the paradigm of understanding creativity . If a new model and assessment were created , this should be subject to a rigorous review to determine the reliability and validity of the model and assessment .
