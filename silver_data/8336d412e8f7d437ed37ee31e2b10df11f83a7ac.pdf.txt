ARTICLE Distinct inter - domain interactions of dimeric versus monomeric α - catenin link cell junctions to ﬁ laments Erumbi S . Rangarajan 1 , Emmanuel W . Smith 1 & Tina Izard 1 , 2 ✉ Attachment between cells is crucial for almost all aspects of the life of cells . These inter - cell adhesions are mediated by the binding of transmembrane cadherin receptors of one cell to cadherins of a neighboring cell . Inside the cell , cadherin binds β - catenin , which interacts with α - catenin . The transitioning of cells between migration and adhesion is modulated by α - catenin , which links cell junctions and the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton . At cell junctions , a single β - catenin / α - catenin heterodimer slips along ﬁ lamentous actin in the direction of cytoskeletal tension which unfolds clustered heterodimers to form catch bonds with F - actin . Outside cell junctions , α - catenin dimerizes and links the plasma membrane to F - actin . Under cytoskeletal tension , α - catenin unfolds and forms an asymmetric catch bond with F - actin . To understand the mechanism of this important α - catenin function , we deter - mined the 2 . 7 Å cryogenic electron microscopy ( cryoEM ) structures of ﬁ lamentous actin alone and bound to human dimeric α - catenin . Our structures provide mechanistic insights into the role of the α - catenin interdomain interactions in directing α - catenin function and suggest a bivalent mechanism . Further , our cryoEM structure of human monomeric α - catenin provides mechanistic insights into α - catenin autoinhibition . Collectively , our structures cap - ture the initial α - catenin interaction with F - actin before the sensing of force , which is a crucial event in cell adhesion and human disease . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04610 - x OPEN 1 The Cell Adhesion Laboratory , UF Scripps , Jupiter , FL 33458 , USA . 2 The Skaggs Graduate School , The Scripps Research Institute , Jupiter , FL 33458 , USA . ✉ email : candice . losey @ u ﬂ . edu COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2023 ) 6 : 276 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04610 - x | www . nature . com / commsbio 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; M ulticellular organisms have well - de ﬁ ned and tightly regulated mechanisms for cell adhesion . Speci ﬁ cally , their endothelial , epithelial , and neuronal tissues require specialized cell - cell adhesion complexes , termed adherens junctions . These junctions are crucial for several normal func - tions , including embryonic morphogenesis , tissue integrity , homeostasis , and wound healing 1 , 2 . Disruption of adherens junctions often leads to the development of cancer and vascular diseases 3 , 4 . Speci ﬁ cally , the disassembly of adherens junctions causes loss of cell polarity and contact inhibition that favor the epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition 5 – 7 . Such disruption of the epithelial polarity or cell - cell contacts often results in develop - mental defects 8 – 12 . Nevertheless , for cells to move and migrate , these specialized cell - cell junctions require dynamic regulation to allow continuous formation and severance of adhesive interac - tions between neighboring cells 2 , 13 . The cadherin - associated macromolecular complex is the master cell adhesion regulator that links neighboring cells 14 , 15 . Cadherin is a transmembrane protein that dimerizes with cad - herin of an adjacent cell and also binds β - catenin intracellularly . β - Catenin then binds the α - catenin to form the cadherin / β - catenin / α - catenin heterotrimer 1 , 16 . This complex mechanically couples neighboring cells to their respective underlying actin cytoskeleton 14 , 17 . The actin cytoskeleton is a key regulator , and its alterations control the morphogenetic movements of sheets of cells . Through its interactions with α - catenin , the cytoskeleton controls many cellular functions such as cell motility , cell shape , cell polarity , or the regulation of transcription . In addition to providing cell - cell adhesion , binding of the cadherin / β - catenin / α - catenin heterotrimer to the actin cytoske - leton strengthens tissues mechanically 18 , 19 . This protein complex also senses and transmits mechanical tension between cells during collective cell migration 13 . Such mechanical forces are either external , for example , the shearing forces of ﬂ owing blood in vessels , or inside the cells whereby myosin motor proteins induce contraction of the actin cytoskeleton 13 , 20 – 22 . α - Catenin regulates the polymerization of the cytoskeleton that transitions cells between migration and adhesion . Thus , not surprisingly , α - catenin knockout mice display defective cell adhesion , migration , and proliferation 23 . α - Catenin is highly dynamic and functions either as a mono - mer or dimer . Both quaternary α - catenin states bind the actin cytoskeleton , although with different af ﬁ nities that are increased by cytoskeletal tension 24 – 27 . However , only monomeric α - catenin binds β - catenin since the homo - and heterodimer binding sites overlap on the α - catenin amino - terminal domain . As a dimer , α - catenin resides in the cytosol and strongly induces ﬁ lopodia , vital structures that initiate epithelial cell - cell contacts 28 , 29 in contrast to undecorated F - actin , which is mostly limited to lamellipodia . In addition to regulating the organization of F - actin 30 , the α - catenin dimer also connects the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton , thereby promoting cell adhesion and cell migration 28 . Mammalian α - catenin binds and bundles actin ﬁ laments 30 and inhibits the seven - subunit actin - related protein2 / actin - related protein 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) - mediated nucleation of F - actin assembly 26 . Depleting cytosolic α - catenin dimers increases the actin - dependent membrane dynamics and the cell - migration rate of Madin - Darby Canine Kidney epithelial cells 31 . Binding studies have relied on α - catenin pull - downs with F - actin , which are dif ﬁ cult to interpret because of the tendency of α - catenin to precipitate and because α - catenin transitions between a monomer and a dimer . Structures of α - catenin have mainly used isolated α - catenin domains because of the ﬂ exibility of α - catenin and the monomer - dimer transition of α - catenin that hinder high - resolution structure determinations . We initially reported the human dimeric α - catenin Δ 1 - 81 crystal structure ( PDB entry 4igg ) to 3 . 7 Å resolution 32 . Surprisingly , the carboxy - terminal α - catenin F - actin binding domains were not related by the two - fold axis that relates the remainder of the two α - catenin polypeptide chains . An apparently monomeric full - length murine α - catenin dimerized in the crystal and showed disorder for the amino - terminal and the carboxy - terminal domain and provided 6 . 5 Å insights for residues 85 – 262 and 290 – 631 ( out of 906 residues ) ( PDB entry 4k1n ) 33 . Another 4 Å murine dimeric truncated α - catenin ( Δ 1 – 81 and Δ 884 – 906 ) crystal structure lacked inter - pretable electron density for the F - actin binding domain ( PDB entry 6o3e ) 34 . Therefore , any structural data on monomeric α - catenin is long overdue to ﬁ ll this large knowledge gap . Here we report the 6 . 9 Å monomeric α - catenin cryogenic electron microscopy ( cryoEM ) structure . To the best of our knowledge , this is the ﬁ rst report of full - length α - catenin in its monomeric state that provides mechanistic insights into monomeric α - catenin function . Our data suggest that the linker preceding the α - catenin carboxy - terminal F - actin binding domain ( FABD ) forms an α - helix that restricts the ﬂ exibility of the FABD in monomeric α - catenin . Unexpectedly , monomeric α - catenin shows amino - terminal ( instead of the previously suggested car - boxy - terminal ) ﬂ exibility , which has different functional con - sequences , and therefore provides structural clues about its autoinhibition in particular with respect to binding to F - actin . Further , α - catenin functions outside cell junctions where dimeric α - catenin modulates F - actin organization 30 and regulates cell migration and cell adhesion by simultaneously binding to F - actin and the plasma membrane 28 . Recently , the cryoEM structures of the isolated α - catenin FABD bound to F - actin provided insights into monomeric α - catenin 35 , 36 , as envisioned in a heterodimeric complex with β - catenin , at cell junctions . Here we report the much higher resolution ( 2 . 8 Å ) cryoEM structure of human dimeric α - catenin bound to F - actin and the 2 . 7 Å cryoEM structure of F - actin . Surprisingly , the α - catenin FABDs are detached from the remainder of the molecule . Functionally important , the lack of interdomain interactions suggests that the amino - terminal α - catenin domains of dimeric α - catenin might bind to the plasma membrane independently of the free α - catenin FABD engaging in interactions with ﬁ lamentous actin . Our data also suggest a bivalent mechanism . Collectively , our results advance our knowledge of how α - catenin functions allosterically to regulate speci ﬁ c signaling pathways depending on its oligomeric state . Results Human monomeric α - catenin has distinct interdomain inter - actions . To gain molecular and mechanistic insights into the function of monomeric α - catenin , we solved the cryoEM struc - ture of monomeric α - catenin to 6 . 9 Å resolution ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Our sample comprises full - length monomeric α - catenin ( residues 1 – 906 ) as we con ﬁ rmed by size exclusion chromatography multi - angle light scattering ( Fig . 2 and Supplementary Table S1 ) . Surprisingly , in our structure , the two amino - terminal 4 - helix bundle domains ( residues 1 – 276 ) are disordered and not visible ( Fig . 1b ) which explains the modest resolution despite countless efforts that , for example , included treatment with glutaraldehyde . Nevertheless , we posit that this structure determination is a substantial achievement given that attempts to determine the monomeric α - catenin structure proved too dif ﬁ cult for the past decade 33 . Given the wealth of available crystal and AlphaFold 37 structures , insights are obtained even at this modest resolution . For example , our monomeric α - catenin uncovered interactions of the middle domain with the FABD that have not been seen in any of the reported crystal structures . Speci ﬁ cally , the FABD interacts ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04610 - x 2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2023 ) 6 : 276 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04610 - x | www . nature . com / commsbio with the last 4 - helix bundle of the middle domain through hydrophobic interactions . Charged residues surround the domain interface that might contribute towards the conformational ﬂ exibility of the full - length protein . In addition , the α - helix that we observe in the linker region that connects the middle domain to FABD ( residues 636 - 650 ) is positioned centrally . This central location places this α - helix near the vinculin binding domain , the last 4 - helix bundle of the middle domain , and the FABD . Therefore , this α - helix might play a role in the interdomain interactions that are severed depending on the functional state of α - catenin . Finally , the carboxy - terminal 43 residues were found to be disordered and could not be modeled . The observed amino - terminal disorder is consistent with size - exclusion chromatography small - angle X - ray scattering ( SEC - SAXS ) data that showed that the α - catenin amino - terminal domain connects via a ﬂ exible linker ( residues 262 – 277 ) that undergoes motions relative to the α - catenin middle domain 38 . In our previously reported dimeric crystal structure , the carboxy - terminal FABDs were oriented differently to engage in distinct inter - domain interactions with the ﬁ rst 4 - helix bundle domain ( residues 277 – 392 ) of the middle domain that binds to vinculin 32 ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . These interdomain contacts are not seen in our monomeric α - catenin cryoEM structure . Instead , the FABD of monomeric α - catenin engages in interactions only with the last 4 - helix bundle of the middle domain ( residues 507 – 632 ) ( Fig . 1c , d ; Supplementary Table S2 ) . Notably , residues 636 - 650 that connect the middle domain to the FABD form an α - helix that has not been ordered in any α - catenin structure thus far . This 636 – 650 α - helix lies almost parallel to the last 4 - helix bundle of the middle domain ( residues 507 – 631 ) ( Fig . 1c ) . The 636 - 650 connecting α - helix is also near the vinculin binding domain ( VBD ) where , for example , residue D649 is in proximity with VBD residue R332 ( Supplementary Fig . S2d ) .

To gain molecular and mechanistic insights into the important functions of dimeric α - catenin outside the cell junction area , we determined the 2 . 8 Å cryoEM structure of the human Δ 1 – 21 α - catenin dimer bound to F - actin ( Fig . 3 ; Supplementary Figs . S3 , S4 ; Table 1 ) . Disappointing at ﬁ rst glance , the ﬁ rst 709 and last 35 α - catenin residues ( and a loop , α - catenin residues 805 - 810 ) are disordered in our α - catenin bound to F - actin structure . The amino - terminal disorder is consistent with size exclusion chromatography small - angle X - ray scattering data that showed that in the α - catenin dimer , the FABDs are separated from the rest of the molecule 38 , 39 . However , the ﬁ nding that the amino - terminal domains are disordered and therefore not in contact with the α - catenin FABDs is functionally important , as it makes the FABDs readily available for binding to F - actin and thus explains its higher af ﬁ nity . Our dimeric α - catenin cryoEM structure bound to F - actin and dimeric α - catenin crystal structure are also consistent with small - angle neutron scattering data that showed that the dimeric α - catenin is more extended compared to unbound dimeric α - catenin 38 . Most α - catenin contacts with F - actin are formed by the second last two α - helices of α - catenin ( residues 772 – 841 ) with two actin subunits . The regions corresponding to the fourth ( residues 785 - 804 ) and ﬁ fth ( residues 811 – 824 ) α - helices of the α - catenin FABD interact exclusively with the third subdomain ( residues 145 – 180 and 270 – 337 ) of one actin subunit . The remaining α - catenin FABD interactions with F - actin occur predominantly with the longitudinal neighboring actin subunit . Such intermolecular interactions include a portion of fourth α - catenin FABD α - helix ( residues 772 – 786 ) and regions of ﬁ fth α - helix ( residues 834 – 841 ) with the actin DNAse I binding loop ( D - loop ) . The most carboxy - terminal α - catenin region ( residues 862 – 870 ) extends to bind the longitudinal neighboring actin subunit ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . Interestingly , the α - catenin carboxy terminus engages in inter - molecular interactions with the fourth α - helix of the FABD helical bundle of a neighboring α - catenin molecule ( Fig . 3b ) . This α - catenin / α - catenin interaction is formed by hydrophobic inter - molecular contacts that include V870 with V800 ’ and L803 ’ or L869 with V796 ’ ( where the prime indicates a residue on a separate α - catenin polypeptide chain ) ( Fig . 3b ) . As noted for the murine structures 35 , 36 of the isolated α - catenin FABDs bound to F - actin , we ﬁ nd a release of the amino - terminal FABD α - helix upon binding to F - actin . We ﬁ nd that this α - helix is fully exposed . In contrast , the earlier reports suggested that almost two turns of this α - helix remain in its unbound conformation . Structural alterations in dimeric α - catenin upon binding to F - actin . The murine dimeric α - catenin structures have their FABDs disordered and have already been compared to our human Fig . 3 The 2 . 8 Å cryoEM structure of dimeric α - catenin bound to F - actin . a C α trace of α - catenin , colored spectrally from shorter to longer wavelengths for residues 710 – 871 as indicated .

Comparison of our unbound dimeric α - catenin struc - ture ( PDB entry 4igg ) 32 with our human α - catenin bound to F - actin ( this report ) instead , therefore , provides new insights . In contrast to our F - actin - bound cryoEM structure ( Fig . 3b ) , the carboxy - termini of each protomer in our dimeric unbound α - catenin crystal structure do not interact with each other 32 . In our dimeric unbound α - catenin crystal structure , each carboxy termi - nus has a unique conformation ( Fig . 3c ) . In our actin - bound cryoEM α - catenin structure and in subunit ‘ A ’ of our unbound α - catenin crystal structure , the carboxy terminus is extended , although in different directions ( Fig . 3c ; Supplementary Fig . S5a – c ) . For example , in subunit ‘ A ’ , α - catenin residue N710 resides near S851 ( Supplementary Fig . S5a ) while in subunit ‘ B ’ and our actin - bound structure , N710 interacts further down the polypeptide chain and resides near S858 instead ( Supplementary Fig . S5b , c ) . However , binding to ﬁ lamentous actin results in the α - catenin carboxy terminus ( residues 860 – 862 ) occupying the space ﬁ lled by the ﬁ rst α - helix of the FABD in the unbound α - catenin crystal structure that becomes disordered in the actin - bound structure ( Supplementary Fig . S5d ) . Differences in the two protomers in the crystal structure are also seen in the loop ( residues 805 – 810 ) that connects the last two α - helices of the FABD . These are disordered in our F - actin - bound α - catenin cryoEM structure . Here , induced - ﬁ t causes α - catenin movements of ~ 19 Å of the carboxy - terminal half of the penultimate α - helix of the FABD 5 - helix bundle ( Supplementary Fig . S5e ) . Comparison of monomeric and dimeric α - catenin bound to F - actin . The isolated α - catenin FABD bound to F - actin structure seems to be a good indicator of how the α - catenin FABD interacts with F - actin when α - catenin is bound to β - catenin . These structures of the isolated ( murine or human ) α - catenin FABDs ( residues 699 – 871 ) bound to ( chicken or rabbit ) F - actin 35 , 36 , 40 ( PDB entries 6wvt or 6upv , respectively ) are similar to our dimeric α - catenin bound to F - actin structure and can be super - imposed with root mean square deviations of 0 . 7 Å for 9745 atoms . At our 2 . 8 Å resolution , we can ﬁ t the amino acids clearly into our obtained Coulomb potential map ( Fig . 4a ) , which shows the electrostatic interaction of α - catenin K797 with actin E334 . We also ﬁ nd an interaction between α - catenin Q789 and actin G146 . Thus , our high - resolution structures of dimeric α - catenin ( residues 22 – 906 ) bound to F - actin and F - actin alone provide detailed structural information that advance our understanding of the initial interactions of α - catenin with F - actin before the application of force . Structural alterations in F - actin upon binding to dimeric α - catenin . To determine the effects of α - catenin binding on the structure of F - actin , we determined the 2 . 7 Å cryoEM structure of F - actin ( Fig . 4 , Supplementary Fig . S3 , and Supplementary Table S3 ) from the same grid and data set that resulted in our F - actin cryoEM structure bound to α - catenin . Therefore , this comparison is directly indicative of any alterations in F - actin resulting from α - catenin binding versus using other F - actin structures derived from a separate actin batch that could be used for such a comparison . Superposition of the actin subunits of α - catenin bound and unbound actin displays a root mean square deviation of 0 . 7 Å for 2888 atoms . The smallest and most ﬂ exible of the four actin domains harbors the so - called D - loop , for DNase I binding loop ( residues 40 – 51 ) . This loop changes its con - formation upon adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis and mediates longitudinal actin - actin interactions 41 , 42 . Binding of α - catenin places its penultimate FABD α - helix against the D - loop , causing a shift of about 7 Å of the D - loop ( Fig . 4c , d ) . Such D - loop con - formation has also been observed in the metavinculin - bound structure ( PDB entry 6upw ) . Discussion The balance between cell migration and cell - cell adhesion is crucial for cells to migrate to speci ﬁ c sites during development . Upon contact with each other , cells become stationary and differentiate into tissues for which strong cell - cell adhesion is necessary to maintain tissue integrity . Cell migration requires changes in cell - cell adhesion to allow cell turnover , which , for example , is essential for wound healing . The interaction between α - catenin and the actin cytoskeleton is key to these cell adhesion processes . α - Catenin functions allosterically to regulate speci ﬁ c signaling pathways depending on its oligomeric state . By binding to the cadherin / β - catenin heterodimer , monomeric α - catenin is part of the mechanosensing complex involved in force transmission . In contrast , dimeric α - catenin is recruited to the plasma membrane , where its simultaneous binding to F - actin promotes cell adhesion and migration 28 . While the α - catenin dimer binds ﬁ lamentous actin readily , the cadherin / β - catenin / α - catenin heterotrimer binds F - actin with signi ﬁ cantly lower af ﬁ nity in vitro 18 , 25 , 43 . However , under tension , the cadherin / β - catenin / α - catenin het - erotrimer binds F - actin strongly by a catch bond mechanism 44 , 45 . New data 27 suggested that dimeric α - catenin engages in a direc - tionally asymmetric catch bond with F - actin while the interaction of α - catenin bound to β - catenin occurs by a slip bond . While single - particle analyses cannot capture the interactions under force , our cryoEM structures identify the dimeric α - catenin interactions that occur with F - actin before the sensing of force and provide the molecular mechanism of the initial complex formation . Binding studies have relied on α - catenin co - sedimentation assays with F - actin , which are dif ﬁ cult to deconvolute because α - catenin tends to precipitate and because α - catenin transitions Fig . 4 The 2 . 7 Å cryoEM structure of F - actin . a Coulomb potential map showing adenosine diphosphate binding .

Recent F - actin pull - down studies of monomeric α - catenin with amino - terminal deletions ( Δ 1 – 665 , Δ 1 – 670 , Δ 1 – 691 , Δ 1 – 695 , and Δ 1 – 698 ) and additional to Δ 1 – 670 , carboxy - terminal deletions ( Δ 873 – 906 , Δ 687 – 906 , Δ 865 – 906 , Δ 869 – 906 ) or a point mutation ( W859A ) , showed af ﬁ nities ranging from 0 . 4 µM ( for Δ 1 – 695 ) to 8 . 5 µM ( for Δ 1 – 664 ) with no binding detected for constructs that also had the carboxy terminus deleted ( to just have residues 671 – 868 and 671 – 864 ) and over 35 µM af ﬁ nity for the ( residues 671 – 906 ) W859A mutant 35 . Since none of these truncated constructs dimerize , the results are dif ﬁ cult to put in the context of dimeric α - catenin . Also , the dif ﬁ culty in recon - ciling the lack of binding of the residues 671 – 868 α - catenin con - struct compared to the four residues longer α - catenin construct ( residues 671 – 872 ) that binds F - actin with 5 µM , with the cryoEM structures , was already noted becasue the four additional residues ( 869 – 872 ) are not observed in the cryoEM structures 35 . Indeed , the cryoEM maps for the truncated FABDs and our 2 . 8 Å map for our residues 22 - 906 α - catenin sample allowed unambiguous tra - cing through residue 871 . The carboxy terminus is also unstruc - tured in the AlphaFold 37 predicted structure and beyond residue 878 in our dimeric α - catenin crystal structure ( PDB entry 4igg ) 32 . The amino - terminal ﬂ exibility of the α - catenin FABD upon binding was documented by limited proteolysis that was con - sistent with the noted weaker density for residues 699 - 702 in the earlier murine cryoEM structure of the isolated α - catenin FABD bound to F - actin 35 . Notably , for our Δ 1 – 21 α - catenin sample , no density is visible before residue 710 . While the isolated α - catenin FABD structures bound to F - actin suggested a weakly bound amino - terminal FABD α - catenin α - helix , this α - helix is severed from the FABD helical bundle in our 2 . 7 Å cryoEM structure of Δ 1 – 21 α - catenin bound to F - actin . Given that ( i ) our Δ 1 – 21 α - catenin bound to F - actin has residues amino - terminal of 710 disordered , ( ii ) in our monomeric α - catenin structure residues 699 - 710 engage in extensive contacts by being sandwiched between residues 631 - 635 that connect the middle domain to the linker α - helix 636 – 650 , and ( iii ) in the truncated F - actin bound FABD structures , the cryoEM maps for residues amino - terminal of 710 are weak and challenging to assign , it seems that the ﬁ rst FABD α - helix plays a role far beyond regulating the af ﬁ nity for F - actin . Additionally , the α - helix ( residues 636 – 650 ) in our monomeric α - catenin structure is a random coiled region in the AlphaFold predicted structure . This suggests that this α - helix might act as one of the tension sensors . Thus far , structural studies were limited to the α - catenin FABD or dimeric α - catenin , which leaves a void in our understanding of α - catenin monomeric speci ﬁ c functions . Our SEC - MALS data show , that deletion of the 81 amino - terminal α - catenin residues results in a purely dimeric protein that does not convert back into a monomer as was also shown for α - catenin Δ 1 – 56 43 . Our cryoEM structure of the strictly dimeric α - catenin bound to the ﬁ lamentous actin and our cryoEM structure of full - length monomeric α - catenin on its own provide important molecular clues into the functions of α - catenin in regulating cell adhesion . The ﬁ rst ﬁ nding with important insights into how α - catenin regulates the cytoskeleton is the observation that the α - catenin monomer has its amino - terminal domain isolated from its middle domain . This ﬂ exibility is consistent with size exclusion chro - matography small - angle X - ray scattering data that showed that the ﬂ exible linker from the middle domain leaves the amino - terminal domain ﬂ exible 38 , 39 . Secondly , such lack of interdomain contacts is not the case for the carboxy - terminal domain , which is the FABD , of monomeric α - catenin , that engages in interactions with its middle domain that are not seen in our α - catenin dimer crystal structure 32 . Indeed , our monomeric α - catenin structure revealed the density corresponding to the linker that forms an α - helix that keeps the FABD close to the middle domain . Notably , the proximity of this α - helix to the ﬁ rst and to the last 4 - helix bundle of the three middle α - catenin subdomains might restrict the FABD in the α - catenin monomer . We identi ﬁ ed the ﬁ rst structural evidence of the linker region in our monomeric α - catenin structure . The central location of the linker α - helix and its position within the polypeptide chain , connecting the FABD to the middle domain , might be important in regulating the release of the FABD to bind to the actin cytoskeleton . Third , in the absence of tension , the FABDs in our dimeric α - catenin bind F - actin without any interdomain α - catenin inter - actions . Collectively , our cryoEM structures and previously published data suggested that two α - helices keep monomeric α - catenin from binding F - actin ef ﬁ ciently while these two α - helices seem to serve as a spring to sever the interdomain interactions of the FABD in dimeric α - catenin . Thus , our F - actin - bound dimeric and unbound monomeric α - catenin structures seem to explain the constitutively active state of dimeric and the inef ﬁ cient binding of monomeric α - catenin . Vinculin is structurally and functionally closely related to α - catenin . However , vinculin is monomeric and does not dimerize . In contrast to α - catenin , vinculin has its FABD buried and autoinhibited 46 – 49 . The nanomolar af ﬁ nity of the vinculin FABD with the vinculin amino - terminal domain correlates with the large buried surface area of the vinculin FABD of about 1800 Å 2 . In comparison , the FABD in our monomeric α - catenin cryoEM structure buries only about one - third ( 631 Å 2 ) of the vinculin solvent accessible surface area . Our monomeric vinculin and α - catenin structures thus explain why only vinculin is autoinhibited . The fact that the FABDs reside on opposite sides in the α - catenin dimeric crystal suggests that this arrangement might facilitate dimeric α - catenin to crosslink two actin ﬁ laments 38 . However , the isolated FABD seems to bundle F - actin as shown by total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence microscopy 36 suggesting that α - catenin dimerization is not necessary for actin bundling . Instead , dimer - ization might be an additional mechanism to explain that dimeric , but not monomeric , α - catenin binds F - actin readily in the absence of force given the mono - versus bivalent binding . Indeed , binding one α - catenin FABD to F - actin brings the second and unbound FABD in proximity to the unoccupied site on F - actin by tethering ( Fig . 5 ) . This proximity substantially increases the avidity , as for example , described for antibodies 50 , and would additionally explain why the binding of monomeric α - catenin without external load is weak 24 , 25 , 27 . While the cooperative binding of α - catenin to F - actin has been characterized previously 27 , 40 , avidity might be a new mechanism whereby dimeric α - catenin acts as a bivalent molecular switch . As discussed above , the newly discovered α - helical linker region might additionally contribute to the functional differences between the monomer and dimer . While less likely due to the proximity - increasing avidity reasons mentioned here , we do not rule out the possibility that only one FABD of the dimeric α - catenin binds F - actin . Clearly , the binding of α - catenin to the actin cytoskeleton is key to cell adhesion . Our structures provide detailed knowledge and mechanistic insights on the interdomain ﬂ exibility of the multidomain α - catenin monomer and dimer . Such ﬂ exibility that we captured in the absence of force seems to correlate with α - catenin function as a mechanically sensitive adaptor . Thus , our data provide mechanistic insights into how the dimeric and monomeric α - catenin make initial contact with actin ﬁ laments . These events are crucial as they eventually lead to the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and the transition between cell migration and cell - cell adhesion . Two F - actin cryoEM studies 51 , 52 corroborate our F - actin cryoEM structure and describe the solvent - mediated mechanism involving ATP in ﬁ lament ﬂ exibility .

All α - catenin constructs were transformed into BL21 ( DE3 ) ( Novagen ) and expressed in 2 liters of Luria - Bertani media at 37°C until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0 . 6 – 0 . 8 . Induction was performed with 1 mM isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalatopyranoside for 20 h at 25 °C . Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15min . Cell pellets were stored at − 80°C . Protein puri ﬁ cation . To generate puri ﬁ ed human α - catenin ( residues 22 – 906 ) , frozen Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) pellets containing amino - terminally His 8 - tagged α - catenin were thawed , resuspended in 500 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris pH 8 , and 1mM β - mercaptoethanol . Cells were lysed by using a French Press . The lysate was clari ﬁ ed through centrifugation at 30 , 000 × g for 45min and ﬁ ltered . The super - natant was loaded onto two HisTrap HP 5ml columns equilibrated in 500 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris pH 8 , and 1mM β - mercaptoethanol , and connected in tandem to an AKTA FPLC at a ﬂ ow rate of 1 ml / min . The column was then washed with a buffer containing 500 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris pH 8 , and 1mM β - mercaptoethanol , followed by a second wash step with a buffer containing 500 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 1mM β - mercaptoethanol , and 100 mM imidazole . Elution was completed through a 200ml gradient of buffer containing 500 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 1mM β - mercaptoethanol , and 500mM imidazole . The elution peak was pulled and dialyzed overnight in 1 liter of a buffer containing 500 mM NaCl , 20mM Tris pH 8 , and 1mM β - mercaptoethanol , after the addition of 200 μ g of PreScission pro - tease . The next day , the sample was loaded onto two HisTrap HP 5ml columns equilibrated in 500mM NaCl , 20mM Tris pH 8 , and 1mM β - mercaptoethanol , which were connected in tandem at a 1ml / min ﬂ ow rate . The ﬂ owthrough con - taining cleaved α - catenin was collected , concentrated , and stored in 100 μ l aliquots at − 80 °C after adding 10 % glycerol . For size exclusion chromatography , a 100 μ l aliquot was thawed and loaded onto a Superdex S200 10 / 300 GL equilibrated in 150 mM NaCl , 20mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , and 1mM dithiothreitol . The protein eluted in two peaks , the ﬁ rst corresponding to dimeric α - catenin and the second to the monomeric α - catenin . For the puri ﬁ cation of full - length α - catenin , we thawed frozen Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) pellets containing GST - tagged α - catenin that we resuspended in lysis buffer ( 400mM NaCl , 20mM Tris pH 8 , 0 . 5mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , 2 mM β - mercaptoethanol and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂ uoride ) . We lysed the cells by sonication , at 75 % amplitude , for 3 min with 5 s and 10 s off cycles followed by centrifugation at 100 , 000 × g for 30min at 4°C . The clari ﬁ ed lysate was loaded onto a GST 16 / 10 Sepharose column that was equilibrated with 150mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , and 2mM β - mercaptoethanol . We eluted the bound GST - α - catenin with 10mM reduced glutathione . The peak fractions containing the GST - α - catenin were pooled , treated with 200 μ g of PreScission protease , and dialyzed extensively against 2 liters of 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , and 1mM β - mercaptoethanol . The dialyzed sample was then passed through a GST 16 / 10 Sepharose column , and the ﬂ owthrough fractions containing the GST - tag cleaved α - catenin were collected , concentrated , supplemented with 10 % glycerol and ﬂ ash frozen in liquid nitrogen as 500 μ l aliquots until further processing . As a ﬁ nal step , the thawed aliquots were passed through a Superdex S200 10 / 300 GL column pre - equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 2mM tris ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) phosphine ( TCEP ) . The monomer and dimer peaks were pooled separately and loaded for a second time on Superdex S200 10 / 300 GL to get enriched monomer or dimer samples . Size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi - angle light scattering ( SEC - MALS ) . SEC - MALS was performed as described 53 . Brie ﬂ y , to determine the absolute molar mass , SEC - MALS analyses were carried out using an Agilent 1260 In ﬁ nity HPLC system consisting of a variable wavelength detector for ultraviolet absorption monitoring coupled in line with Dawn - Heleos II multi - angle light - scattering detector ( Wyatt Technology ) and OptiLab T - rex differential refractive index detector ( Wyatt Technology ) . Samples were passed through an analytical Superdex S200 10 / 300 GL column pre - equilibrated with 20mM Tris - HCl pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 2mM TCEP at a ﬂ ow rate of 0 . 5 ml / min . Bovine serum albumin ( BSA ; from Pierce ) was used as a standard , and all the data acquisition and subsequent analyses were carried out using ASTRA software version 6 . 1 . Actin polymerization . Polymerization of F - actin was performed as described 53 . Brie ﬂ y , rabbit skeletal muscle G - actin ( 50 μ l at 1mg / ml ) was dialyzed against 500 ml of G - actin buffer ( 2mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2mM adenosine triphosphate , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 0 . 5 mM β - mercaptoethanol ) overnight at 4 °C to ensure complete depolymerization of actin . G - actin ( at 0 . 6mg / ml ) was then polymerized with the addition of polymerization buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM imidazole , 2 mM ATP , and 5 mM EGTA ) and left overnight to polymerize fully . F - actin prepared this way was stored at 4°C and used for up to two weeks . Cryogenic electron microscopy grid preparation . For dimeric human α - catenin ( residues 22 – 906 ) bound to F - actin , grids were prepared by reconstituting the complex on the grid . C - ﬂ at 1 . 2 / 1 . 3 400 mesh grids were glow discharged for 60s and placed into a Leica GP2 cryogenic plunger set to 65 % humidity and 21°C . First , 3 . 5 μ l of 0 . 7 μ M F - actin diluted in 150 NaCl , 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , and 1mM dithiothreitol was placed on the carbon ﬁ lm side of the C - ﬂ at grid and left to incubate for 1min before the successive addition and removal of 3 . 5 μ l of 7 . 6 μ M ( 0 . 74 mg / ml ) F - actin . The addition and removal of α - catenin was repeated four times before blotting from the backside of the grid . Grids were immediately plunged frozen in liquid ethane and transferred into a JEOL cryoARM300 for screening and data collection . Vitri ﬁ cation of human monomeric α - catenin was carried out by applying 3 μ l of 0 . 25 mg / ml α - catenin on a glow discharged 300 mesh Au - Flat holey grids ( ProtoChips ) with 1 . 3 μ m holes at 95 % humidity and 4 °C using a Leica GP2 plunge freezer . The blotting was carried out for 6seconds , and the grids were immediately plunged frozen into liquid ethane . Frozen grids were then transferred into a JEOL cryoARM300 for screening and data collection . Cryogenic electron microscopy data collection . All datasets were collected on a JEOL cryoARM300 operated at 300 kV as described 53 . Brie ﬂ y , movies were col - lected at a nominal magni ﬁ cation of 60 , 000 with parallel illumination with an Omega in - column energy ﬁ lter tuned to a slit width of 20eV . SerialEM 54 ( reference number to be corrected ) was used to record electron micrographs using a K3 direct electron detector ( Gatan ) operated in correlated double sampling mode and a calibrated object pixel size of 0 . 72 Å with a corresponding ﬂ ux of 7 electrons / pixel / second on the detector . Automatic alignment of zero loss peak is automatically carried out every 6hours using the serialEM script . For full - length human monomeric α - catenin data collection , the exposure time and dose rate were adjusted to provide a total dose of 48 electrons / Å 2 per micrograph , fractionated into 40 frames to achieve a corresponding electron dose of 1 . 2 electrons / Å 2 per frame . For all other samples , the exposure time and dose rate were adjusted to provide a total dose of 60 electrons / Å 2 per micrograph , fractionated into 50 frames . High ﬂ ashing of the cold ﬁ eld emission gun was set up Fig . 5 Bivalency and interdomain interactions as potential regulators of the binding of α - catenin to ﬁ lamentous actin . a In vinculin , the vinculin head domain ( white ) binds to the F - actin binding site on the vinculin tail domain ( colored from red to orange ) . Therefore , vinculin is autoinhibited with weak binding to F - actin . b In monomeric α - catenin , the F - actin binding domain ( colored from red to orange ) is accessible to bind to F - actin . Monomeric α - catenin might bind F - actin weaker as a monovalent protein . c The α - catenin dimer will likely have one of its FABDs binding to F - actin ﬁ rst . d Such initial interaction increases the avidity for the second FABD of the α - catenin dimer to bind to F - actin . e The minimal FABD ( colored from red to orange ) binds F - actin ( white ) with the highest af ﬁ nity .

Astigmatism and coma - free alignments were performed with serialEM immediately before each data collection and repeated once a day for datasets lasting longer than one day . For full - length human monomeric α - catenin , since Au - ﬂ at grids were used , astigmatism and coma - free alignments were performed using the carbon ﬁ lm of a C - ﬂ at grid that was brie ﬂ y loaded before each data collection . For all datasets , micrographs were acquired from a pattern of 3× 3 holes recording each image at the center of the hole . One focus step per stage shift was performed on the ﬁ lm area next to the central hole . Micrographs were collected with a targeted defocus of − 0 . 6 to − 2 . 6 μ m , and gain - corrected movies were saved and transferred to a computing cluster for processing . Cryogenic electron microscopy image processing . CryoSPARC 55 was used for the entire processing work ﬂ ow of all datasets . Raw movies were imported directly into cryoSPARC , and motion correction was performed with Patch motion correction 56 and a contrast transfer function ( CTF ) estimation with a CTF patch estimation . Curation of micrographs was performed to eliminate ( i ) all micro - graphs that had a CTF ﬁ t worse than 3 . 5Å for the F - actin - contained samples or 5Å for full - length human α - catenin , and a total full - frame motion distance larger than 150 pixels , ( ii ) micrographs that were astigmatic , and ( iii ) micrographs where thick or crystalline ice was detected . For all F - actin - containing samples , the Fila - ment Tracer function was used to pick particles with relaxed criteria to pick as many particles as possible and remove unsuitable particles during the early 2D classi ﬁ cation steps . For α - catenin ( residues 22 – 906 ) bound to F - actin , 25 , 442 micrographs were collected from four different grids to compensate for the partial or lack of decoration observed on many ﬁ laments . After micrograph curation , 7427 images were selected and processed further . Particles were extracted with a large box size of 1620 pixels ( 603Å ) to facilitate the separation of highly decorated from undecorated ﬁ laments through visual inspection . After extensive 2D classi ﬁ cation , particles clustering in 2D classes with visibly high degrees of decoration were re - extracted with a smaller box size of 1080 pixels ( 402Å ) , and 3D reconstruction was performed by using the helical re ﬁ nement function of cryoSPARC 55 . The particles were then CTF re ﬁ ned twice with local CTF re ﬁ nement 57 . A ﬁ nal round of helical non - uniform re ﬁ nement 58 was applied to lead to a 3D reconstruction of a map at 2 . 8Å from 403 , 663 particles , with a helical twist of − 166 . 7° and a helical rise of 27 . 5Å ( EMDB entry EMD - 26772 ) . From the same dataset , 2D classes with no evidence of decoration were separated after extensive 2D classi ﬁ cation and used to reconstruct the unbound F - actin 3D map . Using the same processing steps as with the decorated particles , a map for unbound F - actin at 2 . 7Å was achieved from 963 , 102 particles ( EMDB entry EMD - 26860 ) , with a helical twist of − 166 . 7° , and a helical rise of 27 . 4Å . For full - length human monomeric α - catenin , 14 , 333 micrographs obtained after curation were used for processing . A blob picker with a particle diameter of 80 to 120 Å was used for initial particle picking , and after curation , about 6 million particles were extracted with a box size of 360 pixels ( 266Å ) and further binned to 180 pixels ( corresponding to a pixel size of 1 . 44Å / pixel ) . After several iterative rounds of 2D classi ﬁ cation , the resultant particle stacks were used to reconstruct multiple ab initio classes to remove non - ideal particles . The most promising ab initio class was subjected to further curation through additional rounds of 2D classi ﬁ cation . The resulting particle stack was subjected to homogeneous and local CTF re ﬁ nement to improve the overall features of the map . Non - uniform re ﬁ nement was subsequently carried out to improve the resolution ( EMDB entry EMD - 27717 ) . A ﬁ nal round of masked non - uniform re ﬁ nement with a mask prepared from a ﬂ exibly ﬁ tted α - catenin middle domain and FABD of an AlphaFold model 37 was carried out . Cryogenic electron microscopy structure determination . For determining the cryoEM structure of human α - catenin ( residues 22 - 906 ) bound to F - actin , the 3 . 2Å structure of the FABD of α - catenin bound to F - actin ( PDB entry 6upv ) 36 was ﬁ tted into our 2 . 8Å map using Chimera 59 and initially re ﬁ ned with PHENIX 60 , 61 using real - space re ﬁ nement with simulated annealing 62 , 63 to better accommodate our higher resolution map . The structure was then revised with COOT 64 . Despite using a low threshold and low - pass ﬁ lter , α - catenin residues amino - terminal of amino acid 710 were not resolvable and not included . The density ends abruptly . There was also poor density for the short loop region connecting residues 804 – 811 . Finally , there was no density for α - catenin residues carboxy - terminal of amino acid 871 . For F - actin , residues amino - terminal of amino acid 5 and carboxy - terminal of amino acid 374 were not resolvable and not included . The remaining coordinates for both α - catenin and F - actin were visually inspected multiple times to improve com - plementarity through COOT 64 , and further re ﬁ ned through PHENIX 60 , 61 by using rigid body real - space re ﬁ nement , after which outliers were inspected and corrected . A total of six copies of F - actin and six copies of α - catenin were ﬁ tted into the map and the ﬁ nal structure was deposited with the Protein Data Bank ( PDB entry 7utj ) . For determining the cryoEM structure of unbound F - actin , the F - actin coordinates of our human α - catenin bound to F - actin ( PDB entry 7utj ) were ﬁ tted into the map by using Chimera 59 , after removal of the α - catenin coordinates . The structure was then initially re ﬁ ned with PHENIX 60 , 61 by using real - space re ﬁ nement with simulated annealing and then visually inspected multiple times to improve complementarity through COOT 64 , and further re ﬁ ned through PHENIX 60 , 61 by using rigid body real - space re ﬁ nement , after which outliers were inspected and corrected . The resulting structure was nearly identical to that of F - actin in our human α - catenin bound to the F - actin structure , except for a difference loop conformation ( residues 45 – 50 ) . The ﬁ nal F - actin structure at 2 . 7Å was deposited with the PDB ( entry 7uxf ) . For determining the cryoEM structure of the full - length human monomeric α - catenin ( residues 1 – 906 ) , the human α - catenin AlphaFold model 37 was used to ﬁ t into our ﬁ nal cryoEM map using Chimera 59 . The model was then further subjected to real - space re ﬁ nement in COOT 64 . Statistics and reproducibility . Model analyses were carried out in Pymol ( v . 2 . 5 . 2 ) and Chimera ( 1 . 14 ) 65 . Structural similarities were calculated , and variations reported as root mean square deviation were calculated using main - chain atoms with the “ Super ” command in Pymol . Reporting summary .
