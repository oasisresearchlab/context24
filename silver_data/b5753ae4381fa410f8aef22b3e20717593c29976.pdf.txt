JUSSI MIKKONEN TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF DENMARK JUSMI @ DTU . DK ABSTRACT The human creativity is now being supported , or challenged , by an easy access to generative tools utilising Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) . Within the last few years , Generative Adversarial Network - based image generation tools have become available for the public . In this paper , we explore how one such tool , called Midjourney , could be used for generating moodboards . Our work focuses on exploring moodboard image generation via text - based prompts . We take note of the active online discussions , where examples and ethical concerns have strongly emerged during the late 2022 . As a result , the AI produced imagery that the authors could not have produced themselves in any reasonable amount of time , if at all . The GAN - generated images are of high quality , and visually useable for design purposes . However , there are ethical concerns on the sources of the images used for training the AI systems , and copyright concerns on the outcomes . INTRODUCTION The purpose of moodboard visualisations in design ranges from informative to inspirational . They are useful for discussing with stakeholders , as well as tools for personal creativity ( Mcdonagh & Storer , 2004 ; Lucero , 2012 ) . The creation of these visualisations has primarily relied on the skills and effort of a human being , creating by using a pen and a paper , recording images and textures via photography , and perhaps using programs such as Photoshop to edit and create something new . Designing these images takes time , effort , and consideration . The graphical and visual skills needed are essential for design , and are at the core of many different design fields beyond graphic design , such as industrial , fashion , and product design . The human creativity is now being supported , or challenged , by an easy access to generative tools utilising Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) . AI - based tools have been used and explored in design in many ways . These examples include generative product design ( Dean & Loy , 2020 ; Cui & Tang , 2017 ) , virtual reality environments and games ( Jain , 2021 ) , and more recently AI - supported UX design ( Lu et al . , 2022 ) . Creative visualisations can be created without any graphical skill by using novel Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) tools using Generative Adversarial Networks ( GAN ) built on deep neural networks ( Oppenlaender , 2022 ) . The first neural network — the perceptron — was an attempt to simulate brain behaviour ( Rosenblatt , 1958 ) . These networks were able to provide a simplistic replication of how memory and learning worked , but failed at simple non - linear logic functions . When these perceptrons were organised in multiple layers and trained in a new way — so that the learned information and errors of one layer could be passed to the next — their " comprehension " and expressivity improved ( Rumelhart et al . , 1986 ) . When these multi - layer networks were used in several successive steps to create deeper stages of artificial neural networks , Deep Learning ( LeCun et al . , 2015 ) emerged . Deep learning enabled the identification of context . Due to this contextual layering , these deep networks are now able to identify and understand higher level concepts that No 10 ( 2023 ) : NORDES 2023 : THIS SPACE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK , ISSN 1604 - 9705 . www . nordes . org humans take for granted , such as e . g . ‘a short woman playing basketball’ , ‘red flowing hair’ , or ‘a kukeri walking in New York’ . GAN use this ability for a double purpose : to both generate an image based on a description , and to assess if the generated image matches the given description . Within the last few years , these AI tools have become available for the public . While earlier forms of machine learning have been used to explore moodboard generation for design processes ( Koch et al . , 2019 ) , our paper explores how GAN - based AI performs as generator of moodboards . However , since the most advanced GAN - based tools have only recently been made available , the research on applying them for any purpose rapidly emerging . These early papers on GAN usage focus on the generative process ( Friedman & Pollak , 2021 ) . Their use has already been met with great enthusiasm as seen in the rapid growth of e . g . reddit communities ( e . g . r / midjourney with over 75k members since it ' s beginning , June 2022 . 1 ) . On the downside , they have also caused considerable anger within artistic community , since they are seen as a direct threat against the artists and copyright ( Jacobs , 2022 ; Warzel , 2022 ) . Thus , we can see that while there is plenty of room for research , it does come with baggage that varrants questions . Therefore , our primary research question is how can a GAN - based AI be used to produce moodboards that are useable in the design process ? To answer this question , we examined the major AI image generators that are available for the public . We looked at the underlying generative mechanisms , and explain how these systems learn to create images . Next , we chose one advanced AI , Midjourney , and used it to generate moodboards . These images were then assessed by the authors on the usefulness when used as moodboards . Finally , we discuss the challenges , research opportunities , and ethical concerns these systems present . Our investigation found that the AI : s are already so advanced that they can be used for creative generation of graphics . HOW HAS AI BEEN USED IN VISUAL DESIGN ? As already mentioned , GAN are very recent , but similar approaches have already been integrated to existing software . The most common is Adobe Photoshop , 1 https : / / subredditstats . com / r / midjourney 2 https : / / stackoverflow . com / questions / 2530449 / how - does - content - aware - fill - work which already has contextual tools available . According to the lead developer 2 , Photoshop ' s content aware fill is based on AI algorithms that are able to identify a what is the most similar contextual thing missing from the image ( Barnes et al . , 2009 ) , and combine that with an estimation of what the missing thing could look like based on the use of ‘millions of photos’ ( Hays & Efros , 2007 ) . Since GAN - based systems are coming to the designers ' toolkit , the implications of use and how they could be used has seen less research . Therefore , we need to first take a brief layman ' s view on the technology , and then use a generative system in practice to generate insights . INVESTIGATING THE AI SYSTEMS Since the topic of AI is a bit fuzzy , we chose to approach them by posing questions that directly influence the designers’ work . We started by mapping out the visual GAN that are easily available for the public , and have summarised the major ones to the Table 1 . We will then briefly explain the mechanisms on how these systems generate images , and how this affects the resulting graphics . WHICH GAN ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ? Our study began by identifying the AIs easily accessible for a typical user with an access to social media , as social media can provide information on the uptake . We first searched for the available AIs of different types , and identified the most accessible image generators . We then searched for any subreddits focusing specifically on those AI : s , and looked at subscribers and activity . We excluded specialised generators , such as GANs focusing on specific images like face - generators ( e . g . This person does not exist 3 . ) . Even though these systems could be useful for developing personas , they are too specialised for our purpose of making moodboards . Table 1 . Easy - access GANs and how to access them . 3 https : / / thispersondoesnotexist . com / AI name How to access Stable Diffusion variants Several different front - ends , such as huggingface . co and stablediffusionweb . com Midjourney Primarily through discord . DALL - E variants Several different front - ends , such as craiyon . com and labs . openai . com No 10 ( 2023 ) : NORDES 2023 : THIS SPACE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK , ISSN 1604 - 9705 . www . nordes . org Our search identified three major GAN systems and their versions ; Stable Diffusion , DALL - E , and Midjourney , shown in Table 1 . Out of these , Midjourney is generally seen as the most advanced , at the moment of writing . Stable Diffusion and DALL - E , and their variants and versions , are available through various websites which provide different types of training data . To understand the meaning of training data , we will next look at how these systems work . HOW DO THE GENERATIVE AIS WORK ? The AI systems work through written text - prompts . The user writes a short description , such as ‘hungarian dances on the street’ , and the AI will then begin generative - interpretive cycle . For simplicity , we ' ll say that GAN has two competing AIs working against each other , hence the name Generative Adversarial Network . The first AI will try to create images based on the prompt . The second AI will try to show that it is false , meaning that it would could not be seen as ' real ' . It does this by interpreting the concepts visualised in the generated image , and comparing that result to the initial prompt . If the second AI ‘sees’ the image as false , i . e . not matching the prompt in the generated image , then the first AI will try to improve the image . These steps will be repeated until the second AI interprets the generated image to match the prompt adequately . This means that both ‘sides’ of GAN must be trained in order for the overall system to work . The training data is usually vast , containing millions of images . In case of DALL - E 2 , the dataset was approximately 650 million images ( Ramesh et al . , 2022 ) . Different systems and different front - ends have their own approaches . It is not always clear which sources and images have been used for training . OpenAI who are behind DALL - E 2 , have issued clarifications on how to deal with questionable materials 4 . To make it more confusing , variants of both DALL - E and Stable Diffusion have different websites that present systems trained with different image types . For example , NovelAI , is trained with Anime images only . However , to keep our work consistent with one platform and training materials , we chose to use Midjourney . 4 https : / / openai . com / blog / dall - e - 2 - pre - training - mitigations / 5 https : / / docs . google . com / document / d / 1XUT2G9LmkZataHFzmuOtRX nuWBfhvXDAo8DkS - - 8tec / edit PRACTICAL USE — PROMPTS , RESULTS , AND UPSCALING The AI we have chosen , Midjourney , works through text - based prompts via Discord . Midjourney has created an open google text - document 5 , suggesting ways to write prompts . They suggest to try prompts with artists ' or studios names , such as " father by MC Escher " . They list ' styles ' such as Gustav Klimt , Alfons Mucha , Pablo Picasso , and Studio Ghibli . These suggest that the AI has been trained with specific source materials , and anyone can use those to prompt the AI to produce an image of specific style . For each prompt given via Discord , Midjourney creates four images , saved as one large image with four quadrants . The user can then continue forward from these images , e . g . by asking new variants based on one image , or upscaling an image . Variant - option makes small adjustments to the chosen image . Upscaling attempts to keep the image same while enlarging it . This upscaling process always creates some variance , so the user will never get exactly the same image . METHODOLOGY Our methodology consists of exploratory use of Midjourney , and using reddit to investigate how people have used Midjourney . We relied on Midjourney - subreddit 6 for any insights on the prompts as a form of crowdsourcing . Before we started to generate the images for this paper , we spent roughly 8h of machine time to learn how to write prompts . This means that we ' ve generated around 630 images including derivatives and variations , and explored how the AI interprets the prompts over several weeks . GENERATING MOODBOARDS In this section , we will explore how the AI can be used to generate moodboards . We will explore how to create moodboards , and how much they require additional work after they have been produced by the AI . Our prompts will always include “ - - q 2 - - v 4” parameters at the end . These improve visual quality , and use the latest Midjourney version , respectively . Furthermore , we will always show the first resulting image with all four variations as outputted by the AI , except when specifically stated to be an upscaled image . 6 https : / / www . reddit . com / r / midjourney / No 10 ( 2023 ) : NORDES 2023 : THIS SPACE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK , ISSN 1604 - 9705 . www . nordes . org CREATIVITY AND IMAGINATION — MAKING THE MOODBOARDS As our test , we gave the AI some specific prompts and see how wild interpretations it generates . Our initial goal is to create imagery suitable for a moodboard . Thus , the prompt will be “moodboard” . The resulting image can be seen in Figure 2 , and we can see that the output does indeed look like an image of a moodboard . However , upon examination , we can see that while interesting , the AI has given each of the four panels it ' s own context or theme . Without going too deep with our subjective interpretation , going clock - wise and starting from the top - left , we have ' magenta and cyan ' , ' Cuban flair ' , ' rustic horror ' , and ' pensive coolness ' . With the exception of our ' rustic horror ' , images of this style could be easily found in fashion magazines . To come up with a context , let’s say we are designing rustic clothing inspired by countryside . Based on this , we ask for a new moodboard , with a prompt “moodboard , objects from countryside” . This result can be seen in Figure 1 , and on a surface glance , it looks like imagery stemming from objects found in the countryside . One common approach appears to be that the objects are taken out of context , and they are mostly stand - alone . There are some images that are not about objects , but scenes . However , they seem to fit the themes . Compared to the previous moodboard , these panels do not seem to have their own unique style between them . 7 https : / / www . reddit . com / r / midjourney / comments / z3af1l / waterbending / 8 https : / / www . behance . net / However , this image does not look natural . The objects are identifiable as something that could be found in the countryside , but some of them do not look realistic . For example , the container in the lower left corner appears to be some kind of jar made out of sheet metal , but has bands with belt buckles on them . On a surface , everything looks ok , but a closer inspection reveals an uncanny valley . Next , we decided to try to create a moodboard with realistic images . To do this , we looked at reddit to find prompts that had generated realistic and high definition images . One reddit - user had created a very realistic looking image of a waterbending monk 7 , so we took the end of the prompt given in the post , and adapted it to our previous prompt : “moodboard , objects from countryside + cinematic shot + photo taken by ARRI , photo taken by sony , photo taken by canon , photo taken by nikon , photo taken by hasselblad + incredibly detailed , sharpen , details + professional lighting , photography lighting + 50mm , 80mm , 100mm + lightroom gallery + behance photography + unsplash” . This prompt contains suggestions that draw from different photographic materials , sourcing specific camera models and photography websites such as behance 8 , unsplash 9 , and Adobe Lightroom 10 . The prompt describes additional qualities in an attempt to generate a sharp , detailed image . 9 https : / / unsplash . com / 10 https : / / lightroom . adobe . com / learn / discover Figure 2 . A moodboard , as interpreted by Midjourney . Figure 1 . A moodboard of ' objects from countryside ' . Note the subtle unrealism , e . g . in the details of the large sheet metal jar on the lower left corner . No 10 ( 2023 ) : NORDES 2023 : THIS SPACE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK , ISSN 1604 - 9705 . www . nordes . org The result is shown in Figure 3 . These results are much more realistic , and while the AI seems to like hats in fields , these objects make sense . There are some minor illusion - breaking details , such as the cups going over boundary near the upper right corner . There are also two images that are not really objects , and look like scenery images . However , this image is quality - wise high enough to pass as a moodboard made of pictures of countryside objects . For our third and final moodboard , we examined how the AI would perform with a colour - based moodboard . Using previous prompt , we changed " objects from countryside " to " hues of red " . The resulting image can be seen in Figure 4 . These images are rich in red , and includes both human faces and provocative imagery in all results . As our prompt suggested " hues of red " , the bottom two panels contain sample - variations on the colour red , while the upper panels do this purely through imagery . As with our first moodboard , images of this style could be easily found in fashion magazines . Finally , we upscaled the lower - left image of the hues of red , shown in Figure 5 . Since the AI re - interprets the image every time , we notice not - so - subtle differences to the original image . All three images on the bottom have considerable changes . Starting from left , the original image had only colour hues , while the upscaled version has textures and what appears to be something resembling a person . The middle image in the bottom has likewise changed , there are some unknown physiology in the abdomen , and the hair has changed colour to white . Finally , we see a pale red - robed figure has appeared into the middle of the field of red shrubbery . Figures 2 , 3 , and 4 show , that the AI is capable of producing high quality imagery that is almost indistinguishable from photographs . However , care must be taken with upscaling , because the images will invariably be different from what was asked and was prevously seen . As such , we see that this AI can produce imagery suitable for moodboards , requiring very little effort and skill . DISCUSSION AND A WAY FORWARD We have used Midjourney to create images of moodboards . The AI produced imagery that the authors could not have produced themselves in any reasonable amount of time , if at all . Our exploratory approach to using the AI as presented in this paper also answers our primary research question , how can a GAN - based AI be used to produce moodboards that are useable in the design process ? However , this result does not come without concerns of copyright and ethics , and subjectively , the process of generating the moodboards seems clinical and intriguing . Figure 3 .

No 10 ( 2023 ) : NORDES 2023 : THIS SPACE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK , ISSN 1604 - 9705 . www . nordes . org WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES FOR UTILISING GAN IN A DESIGN PROCESS ? The moodboard generated directly from the prompt is obtained within some seconds and without a need for retouch . The greatest strength of AI graphics generator lies on the ability to produce visualisations that provoke imagination at different styles and content combinations . However , the designers tend to be in a dialogue with their materials , and the moodboards are seen as sensory - centric approach containing both images and physical materials ( Mcdonagh & Storer , 2004 ) . While visual images are relied by novices , both images and physically sourced visual and tangible materials are most useful for designers ( ibid . ) . The imagery generated with Midjourney is easy and effortless to create , the process being almost clinical . The sensory - centricity is not there , as one is simply typing . And unless the images are made into 3D - objects via e . g . rapid prototyping , the resulting moodboard consists only of images . Regardless , the generated images are interesting and can be themed during the prompt - generation . We see no reason to doubt that these images would not be useful for design mood boards within HCI ( Lucero , 2012 ) . We cannot help but wonder how much the act of trying out the generative AI provoked our imagination . In fact , the research on an AI - tool for developing moodboards emphasised the role of the process , when using the tool ( Koch et al . , 2019 ) . In that sense , there was an anticipation towards the resulting image , to see how well it matched the given prompt . This process itself may be useful in provoking thoughts , and we believe that this kind of " generative process dialogue " with the AI could be interesting for further study . WHAT ARE THE ETHICS OF USING AN AI ? Even though AI systems can be , and are , trained legally with copyrighted images , using the outcome may not be safe from copyright infringement . We cannot be sure if our images are breaking copyright . Another equally great concern is that we cannot know how much we are exploiting the skill and competence of the artists who have spent many years learning their skills . Just before submitting this paper , there was a controversy concerning the images that are used for training Midjourney . Users began to notice that watermarks from Getty were appearing in some generated images 11 . After this , there began to emerge discussions in r / midjourney about images that show other watermarks 11 https : / / www . reddit . com / r / midjourney / comments / zesklv / getty _ images _ watermark _ appears _ in _ results _ has / from the stock photo sources . At least iStock , Getty and Shutterstock watermarks have been reported with the generated images . There have also been reports of signatures , or something resembling an artists signature in the generated images . These have raised a considerable concern in a stock photo company ( Jacobs , 2022 ) . Furthermore , when a journalist used an AI - based visualisation in their article and the resulting backslash from the artistic community was enormous ( Warzel , 2022 ) . However , given the extremely fast - paced development of the AIs , the community is at the forefront . We utilised reddit as a source for detailing and learning different prompts , and we also became aware of the issues via reddit . Thus , the use of the AI is intimately tied with the larger creative community , whether as a source or as a generative seed . These concerns come down to two factors . Firstly , in order to be useful , GAN requires thousands to hundreds of millions of images for training . Easiest way to get a massive set of images is to use stock photos . These datasets are already labeled , and each image comes with a ready - made description . Secondly , the images produced by such systems can be created in a very short time without any artistic skill , through a detailed text in the form of a prompt . Even though the images are a result of a computational system , the parameters of this computational system is based on thousands of humans’ work . These two factors together make the use of GAN image generators problematic , as one has to pit their usefulness against the source materials for training . Ethics of AI are an ongoing hot topic , which warrants further research . CONCLUSION In this paper , we have used GAN based AI to generate images for moodboards . The GAN images are of high quality , and visually useable for design purposes . However , they come with concerns about copyright and exploitation of artists ' work . Our future work will focus on utilising the AI - based generative systems for design visualisations . This specific sub - field of AI is advancing rapidly . Midjourney had two considerable updates during the process of writing this paper , and the images were redone with the latest version . Thus , if is safe to say that when you are reading this paper , the system has advanced beyond the images shown in this paper . Our research has received no external funding , and the access to Midjourney was paid by the authors .
