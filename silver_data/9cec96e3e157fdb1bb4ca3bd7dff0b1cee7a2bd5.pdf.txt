We mimicked the interplay of these proteins using the “comet 14 tail” bead motility assay , where branched actin networks are nucleated by Arp2 / 3 complex on the surface 15 of beads coated with myosin - I and the WCA domain of N - WASP . We observed that myosin - I increased 16 bead movement efficiency by thinning actin networks without affecting growth rates . Remarkably , myosin - 17 I triggered symmetry breaking and comet - tail formation in dense networks resistant to spontaneous 18 fracturing . Even with arrested actin assembly , myosin - I alone could break the network . Computational 19 modeling recapitulated these observations suggesting myosin - I acts as a repulsive force shaping the 20 network ' s architecture and boosting its force - generating capacity . We propose that myosin - I leverages its 21 power stroke to amplify the forces generated by Arp2 / 3 complex - nucleated actin networks . 22 2 Introduction 23 Actin assembly stimulated by Arp2 / 3 complex provides pushing forces for diverse cellular 24 processes ( 1 - 8 ) , including lamellipodial protrusion , endocytosis , phagocytosis , and cell adhesion . After 25 being activated by membrane - associated nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) , Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates 26 new actin branches from the sides of pre - existing mother filaments , generating branched , dendritic actin 27 networks that exert pushing forces against or deform the membrane . The network geometry , assembly 28 kinetics , and mechanical properties are dynamically adapted by a set of actin binding proteins ( e . g . , capping 29 proteins , nucleation promoting factors , profilin , cofilin , and crosslinkers ) that respond to mechanical loading 30 ( 9 - 19 ) . 31 Class - I myosins ( myosin - Is ) ( 20 , 21 ) frequently colocalize with Arp2 / 3 complex - nucleated branched 32 actin networks near membranes ( 22 - 26 ) . As an actin - activated ATPase , the myosin - I motor dynamically 33 detaches and attaches from actin filaments in an ATP - dependent manner while generating force through a 34 lever arm - mediated power stroke ( 27 ) . Myosin - Is are single - headed , membrane - anchored motors that bind 35 directly to cell membranes and function in membrane deformation , cell adhesion , and intracellular trafficking 36 ( 21 ) . Although multiple cellular studies have shown that the myosin - I motor activity cooperates with dynamic 37 actin assembly by Arp2 / 3 complex at the plasma membrane , the functional outcome of this interaction 38 remains unknown . 39 To investigate the functional interaction between Arp2 / 3 complex and myosin - I in actin assembly , 40 we developed a biomimetic system using a comet - tail bead motility assay ( 9 , 12 , 28 ) . This system 41 recapitulates the colocalization of NPFs and myosin - I observed on cellular membranes by employing 42 micron - sized beads coated with both NPF and myosin - I . We investigated the impact of myosin - I on Arp2 / 3 43 complex - mediated branched actin assembly at varying network densities achieved through different 44 capping protein ( CP ) concentrations ( 12 , 14 , 29 ) . 45 Our findings revealed that myosin - I alters actin assembly kinetics by reducing Arp2 / 3 complex - 46 mediated branching at NPF - coated surfaces , resulting in a sparser actin network that exhibits enhanced 47 elongation efficiency . This effect is attributed to the pushing force exerted by the myosin - I power stroke 48 directly on surrounding actin networks , propelling actin filaments away . Furthermore , the myosin - I power 49 stroke generates sufficient force to disrupt the network and trigger actin shell breakdown . Notably , a 50 3 computational model at the molecular level provides mechanistic insights , suggesting that myosin - I 51 promotes force generation during Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization by exerting a repulsive 52 force on the branched network via its power stroke . 53 54 Results 55 Comet - tail bead motility assay 56 The comet - tail bead motility assay was used to investigate the effect of myosin - I activity on Arp2 / 3 57 complex - mediated branched actin assembly ( 9 , 28 ) . Full - length , biotinylated Drosophila Myo1d was 58 attached to the bead surface via neutravidin ( myosin - bead ; see Methods ; Fig . 1A ) alongside a GST - tagged 59 WCA domain from human N - WASP . Drosophila Myo1d was chosen as it functions optimally at 20 - 22 °C 60 ( 30 , 31 ) . Bead - bound Myo1d activity was confirmed by processive bead movement along actin filaments 61 ( Fig . 1B ; Movie S1 ) . Control - beads were made identically to the myosin - beads , except that a biotinylated 62 far - red fluorescent dye ( CF640 , see Methods ) was bound to the neutravidin ( Fig . 1A ) . Actin assembly 63 around myosin - and control - beads was imaged simultaneously by epifluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 1C ) . 64 Upon mixing of assay components , surface - bound NPFs stimulate Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated 65 branched actin assembly . Polymerization at the bead surface displaces the branched actin arrays 66 outwards , building tension in the actin network , and ultimately breaking symmetry and forming polarized 67 comet tails ( 9 , 14 , 32 - 35 ) ( Fig . 1C ) . By varying CP concentration , we created networks of varying actin 68 density that ranged from tightly packed and symmetry - breaking resistant ( dense ) to loosely woven and 69 fracture - prone ( sparse ) , allowing us to investigate Myo1d ' s influence on symmetry breaking , comet tail 70 formation , and morphology . 71 The morphology of comet tails generated by myosin - beads differed from control - beads at all 72 network densities achieved by varying CP concentrations ( Fig . 1D ; Fig . S1 ) , and these differences were 73 more pronounced at higher Myo1d densities . We identified three distinct regimes : high , intermediate , and 74 low network densities , controlled by the CP concentration ( 200 nM , 40 nM - 100 nM , and 30 nM , respectively ) 75 4 ( Fig . 1D ; Fig . S1 ) , and describe each regime in greater detail using the 0 . 43 myosin / 1 NPF ratio in the 76 following sections . 77 78 Myosin - I prevents comet tail formation from sparse actin networks 79 Under high CP concentrations ( 200 nM ) , actin elongation was suppressed by capping , resulting in 80 actin arrays consisting of short branches . As a result , actin comet tails grown from control - beads were 81 irregularly organized with sparse networks ( Fig . 1D ; Fig . 2A ) , consistent with previous reports ( 12 , 14 , 36 ) . 82 Myosin - beads ( 0 . 43 : 1 myosin / NPF ) failed to generate a comet tail ( Fig . 2A ; Movie S2 ) , but instead formed 83 loose actin clouds which diffused away from the bead when flow was present in the chamber . The presence 84 of myosin compromised the network cohesion , making it more prone to disruption , and inhibiting comet tail 85 formation . 86 87 Myosin - I facilitates fracturing of dense actin networks 88 At a low CP concentration ( 25 nM ) , long actin filaments emanating from bead surfaces become 89 entangled , forming dense actin networks that are highly resistant to fracture by actin polymerization forces 90 ( 12 , 14 , 34 , 36 ) . Control - beads remained encapsulated within the shell , without symmetry breaking , for > 91 15 minutes after the initiation of the polymerization ( Fig . 1D ; Fig . 2B ) . Strikingly , myosin - beads grown under 92 the same condition broke symmetry within 10 min of mixing ( Fig . 2B ; Movie S3 ) . This result suggests that 93 myosin - I may enhance the force generation during actin assembly and / or may alter actin architecture that 94 promotes network fracture and symmetry breaking . 95 96 Myosin - I induces efficient comet tail growth 97 At intermediate CP concentrations ( 40 nM - 100 nM ) , myosin - beads generated comet tails with 98 sparser actin networks compared to control - beads ( Fig . 1D ; Fig . S1 ; Fig . 3A - B ; Movie . S4 ) . Following the 99 time course of tail elongation , we found that the sparser network architecture of myosin - beads arises from 100 a 0 . 76 - fold lower actin assembly rate ( p < 0 . 0001 , n = 11 , Fig . 3E - F ) as quantified by measuring the 101 rhodamine - actin fluorescence in the comet tail over time . Remarkably , despite the lower actin assembly 102 rate , myosin comet tails in the presence of 50 nM CP elongated ( 0 . 69 ± 0 . 10 μm / min ) at the same speed 103 5 as the control - beads ( 0 . 66 ± 0 . 20 μm / min ; Fig . 3C - D ) . If we define the growth efficiency of actin comet tail 104 as the comet tail length divided by the total amount of actin incorporated , the myosin - beads exhibited a 1 . 4 - 105 fold higher growth efficiency than the control - beads ( Fig . 3G ) . 106 We quantified the amount of a fluorescently labeled Arp2 / 3 complex ( SNAP - Arp2 / 3 complex ; see 107 Methods ) in the comet tail ( Fig . 4A - C ) . Myosin - beads showed significantly reduced levels of SNAP - Arp2 / 3 108 complex ( p < 0 . 0001 , n = 33 , Fig . 4C ) in the network . This reduced Arp2 / 3 complex level also resulted in 109 higher actin to Arp2 / 3 complex ratios on myosin - beads ( Fig . 4D ) , indicating a sparse network organization 110 with fewer branch points but longer filaments ( 15 ) . Despite the reduced amount of Arp2 / 3 complex in the 111 comet tails , we observed equivalent SNAP - Arp2 / 3 complex fluorescence on the control - and myosin - bead 112 surfaces ( Fig . 4E ) , suggesting that myosin - I does not affect the loading of Arp2 / 3 complex onto the bead - 113 bound NPF . Rather , Arp2 / 3 complex is recruited to NPF - coated beads and is ready for the arrival of a 114 mother filament and G - actin to initiate branched nucleation . Taken together , myosin - beads have less dense 115 network structure as a result of reduced Arp2 / 3 complex - stimulated actin branching . 116 We note that the myosin effect on growth efficiency depends on the CP concentration ( Fig . 1D ) . 117 Under low CP conditions ( < 50 nM ) , myosin beads grew even longer tails than control - beads with sparse 118 networks , suggesting an even higher growth efficiency than the 50 nM CP case as quantified above . High 119 CP concentrations ( > 50 nM ) resulted in highly diffuse networks whose cohesion was easily compromised 120 by myosin - I , causing actin dispersal , thus making their growth efficiency difficult to assess ( 12 , 14 , 17 ) . 121 122 The myosin power stroke is required to alter network architecture 123 We examined the role of myosin - I mechanochemical activity on actin assembly by removing ATP , 124 resulting in the population of a long - lived , actin - bound , rigor state ( i . e . rigor myosin ) ( 31 ) . To maintain normal 125 actin polymerization , G - actin was pre - treated with ATP and gel filtered to eliminate free nucleotide ( see 126 Methods ) . Rigor myosin inhibited the formation of monopolar comet tails , while control - beads generated 127 comet patterns as previously observed when free ATP was present ( Fig . 5A - C ) . At 50 nM CP , rigor myosin - 128 beads formed dense actin shells , which subsequently fractured , forming multiple short tails of high network 129 density ( Fig . 5A - C ; Fig . S3C ; Movie S5 ) . Restoring myosin motor activity by adding ATP reproduced the 130 sparse comet architecture with high growth efficiency as observed before ( Fig . 5B ; Fig . S3B ) . At the two 131 6 extreme CP conditions ( 15 nM and 200 nM ) , rigor myosin - beads neither enhanced symmetry breaking nor 132 shed actin away ( Fig . 5C ; Fig . S3D ) . Instead , actin shells were formed around the beads as a result of the 133 strong actin - binding characteristics of rigor myosin . In addition to probing the effect of rigor myosin , we 134 coupled biotinylated , Halo - tagged , actin - binding domain ( Halo - ABD ) of α - actinin to the beads , which binds 135 actin filaments more dynamically than rigor myosin but does not undergo a power stroke ( 31 , 37 , 38 ) . 136 HaloABD - beads behaved similarly to rigor myosin ( Fig . 5C ; Fig . S3A ; Movie . S6 ) . 137 To further elucidate the role of the myosin mechanochemistry in modulating the actin network , we 138 uncoupled the myosin actin - activated ATPase activity from the power stroke by adding calcium . Calcium 139 weakens the affinity of the lever - arm stabilizing calmodulin light chains , resulting in an inhibited power 140 stroke but preserved ATPase activity ( 27 , 39 , 40 ) . We confirmed calcium inhibition using the in vitro gliding 141 assay , where the Myo1d - powered F - actin gliding ( speed 90 . 2 ± 14 . 5 nm / s ) was completely halted in the 142 presence of 100 µM free calcium ( Fig . S3E - F ) . Under these conditions , myosin - beads generated slightly 143 shorter comet tails with network densities that were similar to control - beads ( Fig . 5D - F ) . We conclude that 144 myosin power stroke is required to alter the network architecture and induce a sparse actin organization 145 with higher growth efficiency . 146 147 The myosin power stroke alone can fracture the actin shell 148 We decoupled the force generated by myosin power stroke from the force generated by actin 149 polymerization using Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor , CK - 666 , and the polymerization inhibitor , Latrunculin B 150 ( LatB ) ( 12 , 41 ) . The goal was to arrest actin assembly around the bead prior to the fracturing of the actin 151 shell that results in symmetry breaking . Polymerization inhibitors were added ~ 100 s after the initiation of 152 polymerization . Strikingly , most of the myosin - beads fractured the actin shell and ejected the bead 15 - 20 153 min after polymerization arrest . In contrast , control - beads remained enclosed in the actin shell without 154 observable changes during a 40 min time window ( Fig . 6A ; also see Fig . S4 and Movie S7 - 8 acquired in 155 the absence of phalloidin ) . 156 Shell fracture events were quantified by defining a shell - breaking angle , 𝜃 , where 𝜃 = 0 , indicates 157 no detected shell fracture ; 0 ° < 𝜃 < 180 ° , indicates shell fracture ; and 𝜃 ≥ 180 ° indicates the bead has 158 been ejected from the shell ( Fig . 6B ) . We found 80 % of the myosin - beads were ejected from the shell and 159 7 an additional 11 % had fractured shells , while the corresponding control - beads showed only 16 % shell 160 fracture ( Fig . 6C ) . Inhibition of myosin motile activity by adding 10 mM ADP ( 31 ) together with Latrunculin 161 B and CK - 666 resulted in substantial reduction in shell fracture events and eliminated bead ejection ( Fig . 162 6A , C ; Fig . S4C - D ) . Finally , we performed experiments with a higher CP concentration ( 100 nM ) that results 163 in control - beads of lower actin shell densities ( Fig . 6A ) and found only 2 % shell fracture ( Fig . 6C ) , which 164 further confirmed that the shell breaking was a direct result of myosin power stroke , and is not attributed to 165 differences in the shell network density . 166 167 Simulations show myosin - I forces produce sparser actin networks and aid bead propulsion 168 We developed a filament - level computational model with an overall system size comparable to our 169 experimental setup ( Fig . 7A , see Methods , Table S1 ) . We incorporated the myosin - I power stroke as a 170 repulsive force that pushes actin away from the bead surface , and explore whether this myosin - induced 171 pushing mechanism reproduces the experimentally observed comet tail patterns . In this model , we 172 represented semiflexible actin filaments as beads connected by springs , polymerizing at their barbed ends 173 and pushing against a spherical bead according to Brownian - ratchet - type force - elongation relationship . 174 Spontaneous filament nucleation and branching at 70º angles occurs close to the bead ; elongation stops 175 by capping when filaments reach a specified length . The effect of fluid and bead - filament friction was 176 combined into a single bead friction parameter . Excluded volume interactions prevent filament crossing , 177 resulting in tensile and compressive stresses developing within a shell of branched actin filaments that 178 nucleates uniformly around an initially bare bead . By allowing filaments to break or debranch above a 179 certain tensile force or branch angle threshold , we found that these networks can crack open , leading to 180 symmetry breaking and bead propulsion ( Fig . 7B ; Movie S9 ) as we observed in the experiments ( Fig . 1C ) . 181 To account for changes in CP concentration , we varied the average filament branch length in the 182 simulations . 183 The effect of the myosin - I power stroke was modeled as constant tangential pushing forces of 184 magnitude F myo acting along every actin filament segment close to the bead , with equal and opposite force 185 on the bead ( Fig . 7A ) . With myosin - I pushing force incorporated , simulations recapitulated many of the 186 experimental findings . For the short filament scenario ( high CP concentration ) , simulated myosin - beads 187 8 showed a significant delay or absence of symmetry breaking due to myosin pushing short filaments away 188 from the bead surface ( Fig . S5A , C ; Movie S10 ) . For the long filament scenario ( low CP concentration ) , 189 simulations reproduced the accumulation of a dense actin shell around the beads , which significantly 190 inhibited the symmetry breaking of the control - beads ( Fig . S5B , C ; Movie S11 ) . Myosin - beads by contrast 191 promoted the growth of an asymmetric dense cloud ( Fig . S5B , C ) , similar to the experimental observations 192 in early stages prior to bead ejection ( Fig . 2B ) . We note that simulations do not account for depletion of bulk 193 actin occurring during late stages of bead ejection in experiment ( Fig . 2B ) . We also note a faster 194 accumulation of actin in the simulations compared to the experiments ( Fig . S5B ) , which suggests additional 195 factors limiting network growth not considered in the model . For the intermediate filament length scenario 196 ( i . e . intermediate CP concentration ) , simulations showed a similar elongation speed for the myosin - bead 197 compared to the control - bead , albeit with a less dense actin network ( Fig . 7D - F ; Movie S12 ) , in agreement 198 with the experimental observations ( Fig . 3A - F ) . Further , simulation predicted that actin filaments in the 199 myosin comet tail experienced less stress ( Fig . 7C ) , possibly due to the sparse actin organization , which 200 reduces stresses arising from piling interconnected actin filaments on top of each other . 201 Notably , the ratio of actin to Arp2 / 3 complex density in simulated comet tails did not increase in the 202 presence of myosin ( Fig . 7F - G ; Fig . S6A ) , as observed in experiments ( Fig . 4D ) . This fixed ratio is a 203 consequence of our fixed - filament - length assumption to mimic a certain CP concentration . This assumption 204 validates when capping rate reduces equally as actin polymerization rate in response to opposing force , as 205 reported by Li et al ( 15 , 19 ) . However , the mismatch between our simulations and the experiments suggests 206 an inequivalent effect on actin polymerization and CP capping due to the pushing force of myosin . We also 207 tested whether the presence of myosin would promote actin debranching , which could also change the 208 actin to Arp2 / 3 ratio . We found that myosin forces do not enhance debranching in our simulations ( Fig . S6 ) . 209 Indeed , less debranching occurs since comet tail stresses are smaller in the presence of myosin ( Fig . 7C ) . 210 We next dissected the force contribution from different sources ( actin polymerization or myosin 211 power stroke ) that powered the bead propulsion in our simulations . Strikingly , we found that while in control - 212 beads the symmetry breaking and net comet propulsion were exclusively powered by actin polymerization , 213 in myosin - beads , the myosin pushing forces contributed significantly to bead propulsion after symmetry 214 breaking , and had a predominant effect at high F myo ( Fig . 7H ; Fig . S7 ) . Simulated myosin forces also partly 215 9 reorganized the network such that a larger fraction of actin filaments was polymerizing facing more 216 perpendicular to the bead surface at larger myosin forces ( Fig . 7I ) . When actin polymerization was arrested 217 before shell breaking , simulations replicated the experimental findings that myosin pushing forces alone 218 can eject the bead out of an actin shell ( Fig . 7J ; Movie S13 ) , provided the shell is not too dense or too 219 sparse ( Fig . S8 ) 220 Overall , our simulations with the myosin - I power stroke incorporated as an effective repulsive force 221 replicate most of our experimental observations and support the experimental finding that myosin - I 222 enhances force generation during branched actin assembly to promote shell breaking and enhance the 223 efficiency of bead propulsion . 224 225 Discussion 226 Myosin - I force generation and modulation of actin network density 227 The primary finding of this study is that Myo1d synergizes with Arp2 / 3 complex to enhance the 228 pushing forces of branched actin networks , and that this force enhancement requires the myosin power 229 stroke . Importantly , we also found that Myo1d alters the actin network composition grown from NPF beads , 230 producing a less dense actin network with decreased incorporation of Arp2 / 3 complex . 231 How does myosin - I modulate Arp2 / 3 complex incorporation ? We propose a model where myosin - 232 I motor activity pushes the actin filaments away from the bead surface , reducing the accessibility of actin 233 binding sites for NPF - activated Arp2 / 3 complex to bind and nucleate new branches ( Fig . 8 ) . Alternatively , 234 the mechanochemistry of myosin - I may differently affect the incorporation of actin monomer and CP to 235 filament ends in a way that promotes actin elongation while slowing capping ( 19 , 42 ) . Additional 236 experiments that measure the actin elongation rate and capping kinetics near the NPF - coated surface are 237 required to test this hypothesis . 238 We do not favor a model in which myosin - I sterically inhibits NPFs from binding and activating 239 Arp2 / 3 complex for three reasons . First , the concentration of SNAP - Arp2 / 3 complex bound on beads is 240 unchanged in the presence of myosin ( Fig . 4E ) . Second , networks grown in the presence of calcium where 241 the myosin power stroke was uncoupled from actin binding showed similar actin densities between myosin - 242 and control - beads ( Fig . 5 D , F ) , which ruled out the possibility that the sparse actin organization was due to 243 10 the competition between myosin - I and Arp2 / 3 complex for actin binding sites . Finally , calculations of 244 molecular occupancy on bead surface through protein quantification verified that the steric hindrance effect 245 of myosin - I is likely negligible ( See SI for detailed quantifications ) . 246 It remains possible that force generation by myosin - I debranches actin filaments , resulting in less 247 dense network with reduced Arp2 / 3 incorporation . Mechanical forces ranging from 0 pN to 2 pN dissociate 248 actin branches from their mother filaments together with Arp2 / 3 complex ( 43 ) . A myosin - I paralog ( Myo1b ) 249 that generates such forces has been shown to dissociate branches via motor activity ( 44 ) . Although our 250 simulations disfavor this hypothesis ( Fig . S6 ) , a role for myosin - I induced debranching should be explored 251 further in the cell . 252 Finally , it will be intriguing to explore these models further by performing experiments and 253 computational modeling to probe network growth under mechanical load in the presence of myosin - I , 254 especially given previous work that demonstrates the substantial loading effects on network architecture 255 and power generation ( 15 , 19 ) . 256 257 Myosin - I Cell Biology 258 Myosin - Is connect the actin cytoskeleton to cellular membranes where they contribute to plasma 259 membrane dynamics , organelle deformation , and shaping of actin network architecture . Although the 260 molecular details of myosin - I function have been difficult to determine , recent studies suggest some 261 paralogs are powerful motors that have active roles in shaping membranes . For example , myosin - Is in 262 budding yeast have mechanochemistry suitable for generating power working with polymerizing actin to 263 drive membrane invagination during endocytosis ( 23 , 24 , 45 ) . Our current study confirms the ability of 264 myosin - I to exert substantial pushing forces capable of fracturing actin networks . This power - generating 265 capacity likely translates across species , with vertebrate Myo1c regulating actin architecture in diverse 266 cellular regions ( 46 - 48 ) and Myo1e playing key roles in processes like endocytosis ( 49 , 50 ) , phagocytosis 267 ( 26 ) , and cancer invadosome formation ( 51 , 52 ) . Taken together , these findings point to some myosin - Is 268 as dynamic players , actively shaping cellular structures and processes through their unique ability to both 269 link and manipulate membranes and the actin cytoskeleton . 270 11 Not all paralogs are expected to modulated the actin networks as Myo1d . Notably , some myosin 271 paralogs have substantially slower kinetics which are better suited for a motor that functions as dynamic 272 tether , providing force - dependent linkages between actin and membranes ( 22 - 24 , 45 , 48 , 53 , 54 ) . Our 273 experiments performed at low ATP concentrations ( Fig . 5 A - C ) mimic the behavior of myosins with slow 274 motility rates , and show clearly that slow kinetics can inhibit network fracturing and comet tail growth . 275 Further studies to investigate how the intrinsic kinetic properties of different myosin - I paralogs influence 276 actin polymerization and membrane dynamics will further reveal the diverse role of myosin - I function ( 23 , 277 24 , 26 , 45 , 48 , 54 ) . 278 279 Summary 280 Overall , our study provides insights into how myosin - I molecules coordinate with Arp2 / 3 complex , 281 regulating the dynamics and architecture of the branched actin network and promoting the actin - based 282 motile force generation ( Fig . 8 ) . This work sheds light on synergy between myosin motor activity and actin 283 polymerization , underscoring their collective role in driving morphological changes at the cellular membrane 284 interfaces . Future work to determine how myosin - I affects actin network architecture and polymerization 285 forces will reveal the molecular roles of this important myosin family . 286 287 Materials and Methods 288 Protein Purification 289 Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder as previously described ( 55 ) . Monomeric G - 290 actin was purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S - 300 in G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris – HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 291 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM NaN 3 and 0 . 5 mM DTT ) and used within 2 - 3 weeks .

Human CapZ was 299 expressed and purified as previously described ( 60 ) . Halo - ABD was constructed and purified as described 300 in ( 61 ) . 301 302 Bead Preparation 303 Carboxylate polystyrene beads ( Polybead , 2 . 0 μm diameter , CAT . # 18327 - 10 ) were purchased from 304 Polysciences . Beads were coated with NPF and neutravidin following a previous protocol ( 28 ) with 305 modifications . Briefly , 5 - 10 μL bead slurry was washed with X buffer ( 10mM HEPES [ pH7 . 5 ] , 100 mM KCl , 306 1 mM MgCl 2 , 100 μM CaCl 2 , 1 mM ATP ) , and then incubated with 50 - 100 μl 2 . 3 μM ( 0 . 1mg / ml ) GST - WCA 307 12 and various concentrations of Neutravidin ( ThermoFisher , Cat . # 31000 ) ( 8 . 3 μM ( 0 . 5mg / ml ) for 308 # myosin / NPF = 0 . 28 : 1 , 16 . 7 μM ( 1mg / ml ) for # myosin / NPF = 0 . 35 : 1 , 33 . 3 μM ( 2mg / ml ) for 309 # myosin / NPF = 0 . 43 : 1 , or 83 . 3 μM ( 5mg / ml ) for # myosin / NPF = 0 . 80 : 1 ) on a slow rotator at 4 ° C for 2hr . 310 Beads were then pelleted by spinning at 16000 g for 2 min at 4 ° C , to remove the unreacted reagents , and 311 then resuspended in 200 - 400 μL 10mg / mL BSA , incubating on ice for 30 min to block the free space left on 312 bead surface . Finally , beads were washed twice and stored in 50 - 100 μL 1mg / mL BSA in X buffer for up to 313 3 days . 314 315 The NPF and neutravidin - coated beads were next split in half , with one half coupled with biotinylated 316 Drosophila Myo1d ( myosin - bead ) or biotinylated Halo - ABD , and the other half coated with Biotin - CF640 317 ( Biotium , Cat . # 80032 ) fluorescence dye ( control - bead ) . The NPF and neutravidin - coated beads were first 318 washed with M buffer ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH7 . 5 ] , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 2 mM ATP ) to 319 remove the free calcium in the storage X buffer , and were then incubated with 1 μM biotinylated Drosophila 320 Myo1d , 1 μM Halo - ABD , or 1 μM Biotin - CF640 fluorescence dye for 30 min on ice . Beads were then pelleted 321 under 16000xg for 2 min at 4 ° C , to remove the free unbound reagents , and washed with 1mg / mL BSA in 322 M buffer and used immediately for motility assay on the same day after preparation . 323 324 Bead motility assay / comet tail assay 325 Unless specified otherwise , a typical motility mixture contained 4 μM actin ( 5 % Rhodamine labeled ) , 200 326 nM Arp2 / 3 complex or SNAP - Arp2 / 3 complex , 6 . 5 - 200 nM CP , 2 μM Calmodulin , and 3 μL bead slurry 327 ( 1 . 5 μL of myosin - beads or HaloABD - beads , and 1 . 5 μL of control - beads ) , mixed in 20 mM HEPES [ pH7 . 5 ] , 328 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgATP , 40 mM DTT , 10 mg / mL BSA and 0 . 2 % 329 methylcellulose , contributing to a final volume of 50 μL . The activity of SNAP - Arp2 / 3 complex is slightly 330 lower than the unlabeled complex , so we changed the CP concentration ( 40 nM ) to achieve similar tail 331 lengths , actin densities and growth efficiencies as observed for the native complex ( Fig . 4 ) . For experiments 332 with calcium present , G - actin was pre - incubated with 200 µM EGTA and 50 µM MgCl 2 for 5 min to be 333 exchanged to Mg - G - actin before using . Calcium experiments included 1 . 1 mM CaCl 2 in place of Calmodulin 334 to disrupt the myosin power stroke . Beads were first mixed with all other reagents , excluding actin , with a 335 pipette , to ensure an even distribution . The reaction was then initiated by adding actin into the system , 336 mixed thoroughly , and denoted as time 0 . Slides and coverslips were wiped with 70 % ethanol and ddH 2 O , 337 followed by a plasma cleansing for 10 min . Upon mixing , a volume of 2 . 1 μL motility mixture was carefully 338 applied between a glass slide and a coverslip ( 22 mm × 22 mm ) forming a so called ' squeeze chamber ' 339 with a height of 4 . 3 μm . The squeeze chamber was then sealed with vacuum grease and imaged 340 immediately under the microscope . Time - lapse movies were acquired of microscope fields that included 341 both myosin - and control - beads . In most cases , the actin comet tails emerging from myosin - or control - 342 beads grew with a constant speed during the first ~ 10 minutes following symmetry breaking . As the 343 reagents in the polymerization mixture depleted , tail elongation slowed and eventually stopped ~ 30 min 344 after mixing . 345 346 347 Fluorescence imaging and Data analysis 348 Fluorescence microscopy imaging was performed via Leica DMIRB epifluorescence microscope ( 100x , oil - 349 immersive objective of numerical aperture 1 . 4 ) and Metamorph ( Molecular Devices ) imaging software . 350 Movies were recorded at 25 ° C and acquired every 10 s for 30 - 60 min . Exposure time was 200 ms for most 351 experiments , and 1s to image the SNAP - Surface 488 labeled Arp2 / 3 complex . Images were analyzed and 352 quantified using Fiji software . Actin comet tail length were measured manually at each frame using the 353 segmented line draw tool ( from the end of the tail to the center of the bead ) and converted to the microns . 354 Tail growth rate and fluorescent assembly rate were calculated by fitting the first 7 to 10 data points in the 355 time courses to get the initial slope of the growth and assembly . Growth efficiency was determined by 356 dividing the tail growth rate by the fluorescent assembly rate . Image brightness and contrast were carefully 357 adjusted using Fiji and Adobe Illustrator . Unless otherwise specified , the lookup table for each pair of 358 control - and myosin - bead ( or HaloABD - bead ) were kept the same . 359 360 Statistical analysis 361 13 The statistical significance was calculated using paired or unpaired two - tail Student’s t test in Prism v9 . 0 . 362 Further details are described in figure legends . 363 364 Modeling methods 365 We simulated actin comet tail formation at the level of individual filaments , each represented as a series of 366 segments of length 𝑙 ! , following earlier work ( 62 ) . The pointed ends of actin filament branches are assumed 367 to be connected to a point element of a mother filament , at the location of Arp2 / 3 complex . Such a filament 368 representation allows us to model the effect of myosin as a tangential force acting along filament segments 369 close to the nucleating bead . We thus generalize earlier filament models that did not explicitly account for 370 filament bending mechanics ( 35 , 63 - 65 ) , earlier mechanical models that did not monitor the whole network 371 of actin filaments ( 36 , 66 - 69 ) , or modeled the full process of symmetry breaking and propulsion ( 70 ) . We 372 do not explicitly consider diffusiophoretic contributions to bead motion ( 71 ) . ( Also see SI for further details ) . 373 Forces on actin filaments 374 The position 𝒓 𝒊 of point element i of actin filaments / filament branches evolves according to ( 62 ) 375 𝜁 # 𝒓 𝒊 # % = 𝑭 & ’ ( ) & * + + 𝑭 & , - * # + 𝑭 & . * + / - + 𝑭 & - 01 / 2 # - # + 𝑭 & 345 . 376 Here 𝜁 is an effective filament segment drag coefficient that allows the actin network to evolve through 377 approximate quasi - static mechanical equilibrium , while also providing numerical stability . The spring force 378 is 𝑭 & ’ ( ) & * + = 𝑘 . 1 % & * , 𝑑 & ( & 78 ) − 𝑙 ! / 𝑑0 & ( & 78 ) − 𝑘 . 1 % & * , 𝑑 ( & : 8 ) & − 𝑙 ! / 𝑑0 ( & : 8 ) & where ( i - 1 ) , ( i + 1 ) are neighboring point 379 elements ( if they exist ) before and after i , 𝑑 & ; is the separation distance between i and j , and 𝑑0 & ; is the unit 380 vector from i to j . The equilibrium length is 𝑙 ! , except for ( i ) uncapped barbed ends that elongate on average 381 according to 𝑙 ! ( 𝜏 ) = 𝑙 ! ! + 𝛿 𝑟 ! ( 5 / 𝜏 after their initiation at 𝜏 = 0 , in discrete steps of half - monomer size 𝛿 = 382 2 . 7 nm ( see below ) and ( ii ) a short branch segment joining the mother filament point element to the daughter 383 pointed end , which has length of 𝑙 , ) . * 1 < . 384 The bending force is 𝑭 & , - * # = 𝜅 / 𝑙 . = + [ 𝜕 , 𝑑0 & ( & 78 ) ∙ 𝑑0 ( & : 8 ) & / / 𝜕𝒓 & + , 𝑑0 ( & : 8 ) & ∙ 𝑑0 ( & : > ) ( & : 8 ) / / 𝜕𝒓 & + , 𝑑0 ( & 78 ) ( & 7 > ) ∙ 385 𝑑0 & ( & 78 ) / / 𝜕𝒓 & ] , 𝜅 = 𝑘 ? 𝑇𝑙 ( is the flexural rigidity , 𝑙 ( is the persistence length of the actin filament , and 𝑙 . = + is 386 the average length of the two filament segments composing the angle . For the straight angle that exists 387 among the first three beads in the connection between mother and daughter filaments 𝑙 . = + = 𝑙 ! for 388 numerical stability . 389 An angular potential keeps Arp2 / 3 complex branches at 70 ° . The angular force is 𝑭 3 . * + / - = 390 𝜖 . * + / - , 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 & ; @ − 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 ! / 𝜕 , 𝑑0 ; @ ∙ 𝑑0 & ; / / 𝜕𝒓 3 where 𝜖 . * + / - is a spring constant , i , j , k are the indices of the point 391 elements that make up the angle , and m is one of these indices . 392 The excluded volume force is due to repulsion between two actin filaments and between actin filaments 393 and the nucleating bead . The former prevents crossing of filaments and is exerted along the direction of 394 vector 𝒅 AB that connects the two closest approach points on the filament segments α and β ( 72 ) . It is 395 modeled as a stiff spring force with a max range of 𝑑 - 01 / 2 # - # , with 𝑭 A - 01 / 2 # - # , . 1 % & * = −𝑭 B - 01 / 2 # - # , . 1 % & * = 396 𝑘 - 01 / , 𝑑 AB − 𝑑 - 01 / 2 # - # / 𝑑0 AB , where 𝑑 AB is the minimum distance between neighboring filament segments . 397 This force is distributed to the endpoints of filament segments α and β ( including element i ) according to a 398 level arm rule . Though the typical diameter of actin filaments is around 7 nm , we set 𝑑 - 01 / 2 # - # to be 20 nm 399 in order to mimic the effect of thermally fluctuating filaments taking up a larger volume ( which is not included 400 in our simulations ) . Additionally , since the excluded volume is modeled as a stiff spring rather than a hard - 401 core potential , some level of overlap between segments is possible . At a separation of order the filament 402 diameter , 7 nm , the excluded volume force is 22 pN . Filament segments experience a radially - oriented 403 excluded volume force with the nucleating bead if they are closer to the nucleator than R ; this force can be 404 14 written as 𝑭 & - 01 / 2 # - # , , - . # = 𝑘 - 01 / ( 𝑑 & D − 𝑅 ) 𝑑0 & D where 𝑑 & D is the closest approach distance between the 405 filament segment and the nucleator bead . 406 Myosin forces are given by 𝑭 & 345 = 𝐹 345 𝑑0 & ( & : 8 ) , where i - 1 is the neighboring actin filament point element 407 along the pointed end direction . It acts on all filament elements i closer than 𝑑 345 to the nucleator bead 408 surface . The myosin force acts tangentially along the segment towards the pointed end . We do not model 409 the individual binding , lever arm motion , and unbinding of myosin ; instead the magnitude of 𝐹 345 410 approximates a time and ensemble average over many binding and unbinding cycles . 411 Nucleating bead motion 412 The nucleating bead evolves through time according to : 413 𝜁 * 21 / , - . # 𝑑𝒓 * 21 / , - . # 𝑑𝑡 = − G ( 𝑭 & - 01 / 2 # - # , , - . # + 𝑭 & 345’ & * ) & 414 Where the sum is over all actin segments that contact the bead through excluded volume or myosin 415 interactions , according to the interaction distances defined above . We assume the relative motion between 416 actin network and nucleating bead is dominated by frictional forces between them . We used a value of 417 𝜁 * 21 / , - . # that was large enough to prevent the rapid ejection of bare beads out of a shell at the onset of 418 symmetry breaking , a phenomenon that is not seen in our experiments . We thus monitor the relative motion 419 of the bead and actin network in the limit of quasi - static mechanical equilibrium of the actin network , 420 including implicit transient attachment and detachment of actin filaments to the bead . This approximation 421 does not account for the varying concentration of actin near the bead or the absolute motion of actin comet 422 and bead in the lab frame , which in reality would be influenced by small forces between the bead or actin 423 and the glass slide . 424 Actin barbed end polymerization rate 425 Polymerization of the barbed end of uncapped filaments occurs with the last segment of the actin filament 426 lengthening in increments of half - monomer size δ at a rate given by the polymerization rate . If the end 427 segment reaches a length of 𝑙 ! , a new segment is added with initial length 𝑙 ! ! . Polymerization of the barbed 428 end is attenuated by compressive forces on the spring bond connecting the barbed end point element to 429 the rest of the filament . The polymerization rate is 𝑟 ( 5 / ( 𝑇 ) = 𝑟 ! ( 5 / exp ( −𝑇 𝛿 / 𝑘 ? 𝑇 ) , where the free filament 430 elongation rate is 𝑟 ! ( 5 / and 𝑇 = | 𝑭 & ’ ( ) & * + | when 𝑭 & ’ ( ) & * + is the compressive tension on the barbed end point 431 element i ( otherwise 𝑟 ( 5 / ( 𝑇 ) = 𝑟 ! ( 5 / ) ( 73 , 74 ) . Because each filament segment starts with an initial length of 432 𝑙 ! ! ( for numerical stability ) , the rate 𝑟 ( 5 / ( 0 ) is effectively multiplied by a factor of 1 . 12 . 433 Barbed end capping 434 Filaments polymerize until they reach a final length specified for a given simulation , 𝐿 F & / ( an integer multiple 435 of 𝑙 ! ) , which we vary to simulate the effect of varying CP concentration . Here we didn’t study the effects of 436 a varying filament length distribution . The assumption that 𝐿 F & / is independent of the force is based on prior 437 experiments ( 19 ) and the fact that the filament length added by capping protein is close to δ . According to 438 this evidence , the polymerization to capping rate ratio , as well as the average filament length , remains 439 unchanged by force for a given CP concentration . 440 Branching 441 Branching occurs from actin filament point elements that are within 𝑙 ! of the nucleating bead , at rate 𝑟 ! , ) . * 1 < , 442 independent of the CP concentration . The rate was chosen to approximate the timescale of symmetry 443 breaking and comet speed at intermediate CP . The segment length connecting the mother filament point 444 element to the daughter filament pointed end point element is 𝑙 ! " # $ % & . Their orientation is chosen according 445 to a uniform angle distribution in the cone around the mother filament opening towards the barbed end . To 446 15 maintain a discretization of the network at segment length 𝑙 ! , branches cannot branch from the barbed end 447 point element of the filament . Branches nucleating from the same mother filament have no torsional 448 restriction ( i . e . daughter filaments can rotate about the axis of the mother filament without restriction ) , but 449 implicit torsional restrictions are imposed due to the dense surrounding network limiting this motion . 450 De novo nucleation 451 Nucleation of new filaments of length 𝑙 ! ! occurs at a rate of 𝑟 ! # - * 5 = 5 . These small filaments are introduced 452 with a uniform spherical orientation with either their pointed or barbed end touching the nucleating bead 453 surface . This slow rate of filament introduction was tuned to allow for startup of the network on timescales 454 comparable to experiment , and to allow for the buildup of a thin actin cloud around the leading bead edge 455 during actin comet propulsion , as observed in experiments . At the beginning of the simulation , 200 of these 456 de novo filaments are added to provide enough initial filaments for symmetric growth of the shell . 457 Filament fragmentation and debranching 458 For simplicity , filament fragmentation was assumed to occur above a certain tensile force threshold 𝐹 ’ " # ( 459 ( instead of implementing a rate of severing on as a function of tension ) . 460 For filament segments the threshold was 𝐹 ’ " # ( = 50 pN . This is lower than the experimental fragmentation 461 force of phalloidin - labeled actin filaments , which is several hundred pNs ( 75 ) , but we found that the shell 462 would have difficulty breaking unless we had this lower force . Once a filament segment is fragmented , the 463 filament with the newly created barbed end is left uncapped and can grow to the final length specified for 464 that simulation . Debranching occurs for branches that have a branch bond with tension greater than 465 𝐹 # - , ) . * 1 < = 30 pN or if the angle deviates by more than 𝛥𝜃 # - , ) . * 1 < = 25 ° off of the 70 ° equilibrium angle . 466 The value of 𝛥𝜃 # - , ) . * 1 < was chosen to allow easy debranching when the branch is bent ( similar to 467 experiments where branches were bent and pulled by fluid forces of order pN , ( 43 ) ) . The value of 𝐹 # - , ) . * 1 < 468 had to be sufficiently high such that the network does not easily fall apart . 469 470 Acknowledgments 471 We thank Daniel Safer , Faviolla A .

S1 to S8 786 Tables S1 787 Movies S1 to S13 788 789 Other Supplementary Materials for this manuscript include the following : 790 791 Movies S1 to S13 792 793 794 34 Supplementary Text 795 Myosin steric hindrance effect 796 We quantified the average spatial occupancy of individual components ( NPF or myosin - I ) bound 797 to bead surface for the first three myosin / NPF ratio groups ( 0 . 28 , 0 . 35 , 0 . 43 ) , all of which maintain 798 the same NPF densities ( ~ 6000 / um 2 ) . We found that individual molecular components occupied 799 similar areas in all three groups : 11 . 4x1 . 4 nm 2 / molecule for 7680 molecules in 0 . 28 : 1 800 ( myosin / NPF ) group , 11 . 1x11 . 1 nm 2 / molecule for 8100 molecules in 0 . 25 : 1 ( myosin / NPF ) group 801 and 10 . 7x10 . 7 nm 2 / molecule for 8580 molecules in 0 . 43 : 1 ( myosin / NPF ) group . Therefore , the 802 steric hindrance effect in each of the three groups should be nearly identical . In the 0 . 28 : 1 803 ( myosin / NPF ) group , both control - and myosin - beads displayed similar actin comet patterns , 804 which implies that the steric hindrance of myosin - I does not play a significant role in modifying the 805 Arp2 / 3 - medicated branching under the current conditions . 806 807 Bead gliding assay on actin filament tracks 808 F - actin was made by polymerizing 25 μM G - actin in MB buffer ( 10 mM MOPS [ pH7 . 0 ] , 25 mM 809 KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT ) with 2 mM ATP at room temperature for 1 hr , and 810 stabilized with AlexaFluor 488 Phalloidin ( ThermoFisher Cat . # A12379 ) . Myosin - beads were 811 prepared following the procedures outlined in Methods in the main text and labeled with TRITC 812 during the blocking process using 10 % TRITC - labeled BSA ( Sigma , Cat . # A2289 ) . Flow 813 chambers were made by sandwiching the plasma cleaned slides and coverslips ( 22 mm × 22 814 mm ) with two pieces of double - stick tape , forming a 5mm - wide channel that can hold a volume of 815 up to 10 μL . To immobilize single - actin - filament tracks on the coverslip , we coated the flow 816 chamber with 0 . 5 mg / mL NEM - myosin , incubated for 5 min , followed by two washes with 2 817 mg / mL casein ( 1 min for each ) to remove any unbound NEM - myosin and block the remaining free 818 spaces on the surface . Next , 5 - 10 nM AlexaFluor 488 Phalloidin stabilized F - actin was loaded 819 into the flow chamber to avoid any overlapping between the actin filaments , incubated for 2 min , 820 followed by a wash with 20uL MB buffer . Finally , 10 uL of the 50 uL bead motility mixture 821 containing 3uL TRITC - labeled myosin - bead slurry ( # myosin / NPF = 0 . 4 : 1 ) , 2 μM Calmodulin , 0 . 2 822 mg / mL glucose oxidase , 0 . 04 mg / mL catalase and 5 mg / mL glucose in MB buffer supplemented 823 with 5 mM Mg - ATP and 40 mM DTT , was loaded into the flow chamber , sealed with vacuum 824 grease and imaged immediately under the microscope . 825 826 Myosin inhibition experiments 827 828 Rigor myosin was prepared by excluding ATP from the motility mixture . Gel - filtered actin 829 monomers were incubated with 2 mM ATP for 15 minutes on ice , followed by passage through a 830 G25 Sephadex column to remove residual free nucleotides . The resulting ATP - treated actin 831 exhibited similar polymerization capability in ATP - free mixtures as to those containing 1 mM ATP . 832 Alternatively , myosin was inhibited by introducing 10 mM Mg - ADP to prolong the lifetime of the 833 myosin ADP - bound state . 834 835 Actin gliding assay 836 Coverslips were plasma - cleaned and coated with 0 . 5 % Nitrocellulose and used to make a flow 837 chamber . Flow chamber was first incubated with 0 . 1 mg / mL neutravidin for 2 min followed by 838 blocking with 2 mg / mL casein , twice , 1 min each . Then , 250 nM biotinylated Drosophila Myo1d 839 was loaded into the chamber , incubated for 2 min , and washed with 20uL MB buffer ( 10 mM 840 MOPS [ pH7 . 0 ] , 25 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT ) . Next , 20 nM F - actin 841 stabilized with AlexaFluor 488 Phalloidin was loaded into the chamber , incubated for 2 min , 842 washed with 20uL MB buffer . Finally , the imaging mixture containing 8 . 4 μM Calmodulin , 1 mM 843 Mg - ATP , 40 mM DTT in 20 mM HEPES [ pH7 . 5 ] , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA and 844 0 . 2 % methylcellulose was loaded into the chamber and observed immediately . For experiments 845 with calcium , 8 . 4 μM Calmodulin was replaced by 1 . 1 mM CaCl 2 to disrupt the myosin power - 846 stroke . 847 848 35 Actin arresting 849 Actin assembly was quenched by combining equal volume of motility mixture and arresting 850 solution , which contains 20 μM ( 5 molar excess ) of both Latrunculin B and CK - 666 ( together with 851 20 μM phalloidin for ' + Phalloidin ' experiments ) in 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 100 mM KCl , 100 852 μg / ml BSA , 0 . 5 mM TCEP . Quenched motility mixture was either applied on a squeezer chamber 853 or loaded into a NEM - myosin coated flow chamber ( to make sure the observed shell - breaking 854 was not due to the squeezing effect between the slides and the coverslips ) and imaged under the 855 microscope immediately after sealing with vacuum grease . 856 857 Computational modeling 858 859 Reduction of de novo and branch nucleation rate due to crowding 860 If upon introduction to the system a de novo filament or new branch would strongly overlap with 861 other filaments or the nucleating bead , their insertion is rejected . Specifically , their introduction is 862 rejected if the closest distance between a newly added segment and an existing segment is less 863 than / 4 , or if the distance between the newly added branch and the nucleating bead is less than 864 ( 𝑑 - 01 / 2 # - # / 2 + 𝑅 ) / 4 . No explicit reattempts at introduction of a rejected filament are performed , 865 and the rate of branching , 𝑟 ! , ) . * 1 < , and the rate of de novo introduction , 𝑟 ! # - * 5 = 5 , are left 866 unchanged by a rejection event . 867 Simulation timescale 868 We wrote C + + code with force parallelization using OpenMP . For the case of Fig . 7B ( 0 . 5 μm 869 length filaments with no myosin force ) it takes 360 hours on 10 CPU cores to run the simulation to 870 260 s . The amount of time to run a simulated second increases as the simulation proceeds since 871 no filament segments ( beyond those that are severed ) are removed from the system . Simulations 872 with myosin or with shorter filaments take a shorter amount of time to run the same simulated 873 time since they have overall less filament segments at the same point in time . 874 Simulated fluorescence images 875 To generate simulated fluorescence images of actin comet tail formation we first rotate the 876 system so the net displacement of the nucleating bead occurs along the x - direction . For a given 877 frame , each actin or Arp2 / 3 complex spring bond centroid is placed in a 2d grid with gridlines 878 along the x and y axes and bin size 0 . 05 μm ( z - component is not considered ) . Actin filament 879 segments of length 𝑙 ! contribute 37 actin monomers to the bin they are assigned , while shorter 880 filament segments contribute 37 𝑙 / 𝑙 ! monomers , where 𝑙 is the length of the segment . Arp2 / 3 881 complex bonds contribute a single Arp2 / 3 molecule to the bin they are placed in . A grayscale 882 image is constructed from the grid where each voxel in the image corresponds to a single bin and 883 the intensity corresponds to the sum of the count of monomers in each bin . Finally , a Gaussian 884 filter with standard deviation 0 . 1 μm is applied to the image to smooth the image to a comparable 885 level as in experiment . 886 Measurement of Forces 887 Forces in Figure 7H and Figure S7 are calculated by first rotating the system so the net 888 displacement of the nucleating bead occurs along the x - direction . Excluded volume forces acting 889 between actin segments and the nucleating bead are spatially divided into three regions based on 890 the closest approach point of the actin segment to the nucleating bead . Forces where the closest 891 approach point is greater than R / 4 behind the nucleating bead center in the x - direction are 892 considered back forces . Forces where the closest approach point is greater than R / 4 in front of 893 the nucleating bead center in the x - direction are considered front forces . All other forces are 894 labeled as side forces . Excluded volume forces are further subdivided into whether they are 895 36 caused by filament segments at their maximum length 𝑙 ! ( actin excluded volume ) or filament 896 segments with length less than 𝑙 ! ( actin polymerization ) . 897 Measurement of filament orientation with respect to nucleating bead 898 Filament angle distributions with respect to the nucleating bead , for filaments close to the 899 nucleating bead in Figure 7I are calculated by first rotating the system so the net displacement of 900 the nucleating bead occurs along the x - direction . Only filaments segments with length less than 901 𝑙 ! that are also in the back region ( as defined in Measurement of Forces ) and are also closer to 902 the nucleating bead surface than 0 . 15 μm are considered . For these actively growing filaments 903 we measure the angle between the filament displacement vector and the vector joining the 904 midpoint of the filament segment to the nucleating bead center . This angle is zero if the filament 905 is perpendicular to the nucleating bead surface and 90° if the filament is lying flat on the bead 906 surface . We generate a probability distribution of these angles over approximately 70 s and when 907 the nucleating bead is moving at a relatively constant velocity . The probability of finding the angle 908 to be less than 70° from these distributions is reported in Figure 7I . 909 37 910 911 Fig . S1 .
