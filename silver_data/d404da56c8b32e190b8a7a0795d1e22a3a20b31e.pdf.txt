INTRODUCTION The calponin ( CaP ) family of F - actin - , tropomyosin - and S100 - binding proteins contains three genetic variants , a smooth muscle - speciﬁc variant termed h 1 or basic CaP ( Takahashi et al . , 1988 ) , a neutral variant of similar molecular mass termed h 2 ( Strasser et al . , 1993 ) and an acidic variant ( Applegate et al . , 1994 ) , which is not tissue - speciﬁc and that is particularly enriched in brain ( Trabelsi - Terzidis et al . , 1995 ) . The three variants share high sequence identity ( > 70 % ) within the ﬁrst 273 amino acid residues , but differ in their highly acidic carboxy - terminal tail sequences ( Takahashi and Nadal - Ginard , 1991 ; Strasser et al . , 1993 ; Applegate et al . , 1994 ; Maguchi et al . , 1995 ; reviewed in Gimona and Small , 1996 ) . h 1 CaP has also been shown to interact in vitro with myosin ( Szymanski and Tao , 1993 , 1997 ) , caldesmon ( Vancompernolle et al . , 1990 ; Graceffa et al . , 1996 ) , desmin ( Mabuchi et al . , 1997 ) , tubulin ( Fujii et al . , 1997 ) and phospholipids ( Bogatcheva et al . , 1995 ; Fujii et al . , 1995 ) . Partial sequence similarities exist between calponin and the SM 22 family of smooth muscle proteins ( Lees - Miller et al . , 1987 ; Pearlstone et al . , 1987 ) , UNC - 87 , the bodywall muscle protein of C . elegans , ( Goetinck and Waterston , 1994a , b ) mp 20 , a protein from Drosophila ﬂight muscle , np 25 , a protein of unknown function identiﬁed in rat brain and an immunogenic protein of 45 kDa found in the parasite Onchocerca volvulus ( see Gimona and Small , 1996 and references therein ) as well as with a large number of CaP - and SM 22 - related proteins ( T . Stradal and M . Gimona , unpublished ) . A region spanning residues 32 to 127 in CaP is also present in a variety of molecules involved in signal transduction ( Vav , IQGAP 1 and 2 , Ras GAP - like protein , human ORFP ) and has been termed the ‘calponin homology ( CH ) domain’ ( Castresana and Saraste , 1995 ) . CH domains share about 30 % sequence similarity with the actin - binding domains ( ABD ) present in a - actinin , ﬁlamin , ﬁmbrin and spectrin ( Castresana and Saraste , 1995 ) . Although the presence of this domain has been used to ascribe an F - actin - binding 1813 Journal of Cell Science 111 , 1813 - 1821 ( 1998 ) Printed in Great Britain © The Company of Biologists Limited 1998 JCS3757 Calponins have been implicated in the regulation of actomyosin interactions in smooth muscle cells , cytoskeletal organisation in nonmuscle cells , and the control of neurite outgrowth . Domains homologous to the amino - terminal region of calponin have been identiﬁed in a variety of actin cross - linking proteins and signal transduction molecules , and by inference these ‘calponin homology ( CH ) domains’ have been assumed to participate in actin binding . We here report on the actin binding activities of the subdomains of the calponin molecule . All three mammalian isoforms of calponin ( basic h 1 , neutral h 2 and acidic ) possess a single CH domain at their amino terminus as well as three tandem repeats proximal to the carboxyl terminus . Calponin h 2 differs , however , from h 1 in lacking a consensus actin - binding motif in the region 142 - 163 , between the CH domain and the tandem repeats , which in h 1 calponin can be chemically cross - linked to actin . Despite the absence of this consensus actin - binding motif , recombinant full - length h 2 calponin co - sediments in vitro with F - actin , suggesting the presence of another binding site in the molecule . It could be shown that this binding site resides in the C - terminal tandem repeats and not in the CH domain . Thus , constructs of h 2 calponin bearing partial or complete deletions of the triple repeated sequences failed to co - localise with actin stress ﬁbres despite the presence of a CH domain . Deletion of the acidic carboxyl terminus , beyond the repeats , increased actin binding , suggesting that the carboxy - terminal tail may modulate actin association . Results obtained from transient transfections of amino - and carboxy - terminal truncations in h 1 calponin were consistent with the established location of the actin binding motif outside and carboxy - terminal to the CH domain , and conﬁrm that the presence of a single CH domain alone is neither sufficient nor necessary to mediate actin binding . Instead , the carboxy - terminal tandem repeats of h 1 and h 2 calponin are shown to harbour a second , independent actin binding motif . Key words : Calponin , CH domain , Localisation , Transfection , Basic calponin isoform ( h 1 ) , Neutral calponin isoform ( h 2 ) SUMMARY The single CH domain of calponin is neither sufficient nor necessary for F - actin binding Mario Gimona * and Renu Mital Institute of Molecular Biology , Department of Cell Biology , Austrian Academy of Sciences , Billrothstrasse 11 , A - 5020 Salzburg , Austria * Author for correspondence ( e - mail : mgimona @ server1 . imolbio . oeaw . ac . at ) Accepted 20 April ; published on WWW 15 June 1998 1814 function to the latter GAPs and GEFs ( Hart et al . , 1996 ; Brill et al . , 1996 ) , this region does not correspond to or overlap with the known actin binding domain of h 1 CaP , which embraces residues 142 - 163 ( Mezgueldi et al . , 1992 , 1995 ) . Moreover , established actin - binding proteins that use the region analogous to the CH domain for binding to F - actin contain this domain in a tandem repeat and form parallel or anti - parallel dimers ( Vandekerckhove , 1990 ; Matsudaira , 1991 ; Pollard et al . , 1994 ) , which thus contain multiple CH domains . Notably , IQGAP 1 has recently been demonstrated to exist as a dimer which binds to actin ( Bashour et al . , 1997 ) and in the proto - oncogene Vav the leucine - rich helix - loop - helix motif , contained within the single amino - terminal CH domain , has been implicated in dimer formation ( see Romero and Fischer , 1996 for a review ) . Signiﬁcantly , the loss of the amino - terminal region in Vav containing the CH domain activates the transforming potential of the molecule ( Katzav et al . , 1991 ) . Whereas h 1 CaP is believed to inﬂuence the contraction / relaxation cycle in smooth muscle by blocking the S1 binding site for myosin on actin ( EL - Mezgueldi and Marston , 1996 ) , little experimental data is available for h 2 CaP . However , from the limited localisation data available , this CaP variant has been implicated in the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton ( Fukui et al . , 1997 ) and it has been suggested that acidic CaP may play a role in controlling neurite outgrowth and govern neuronal regeneration ( Ferhat et al . , 1996 ) . In order to gain more insight into the functional signiﬁcance of the different domains of CaP , and in particular the involvement of the calponin CH domain in actin binding , we have transfected epitope - tagged constructs of h 1 and h 2 CaP into ﬁbroblasts and assayed for their association with F - actin in cultured ﬁbroblasts . We show that the single CH domain present in CaP and the sequence - related protein SM 22 does not confer binding to F - actin in co - sedimentation assays , or association with the actin cytoskeleton in cultured cells . Biochemical data using recombinant fragments of h 1 and h 2 CaP and SM 22 support the cell biological ﬁndings and in addition pinpoint the proximal carboxy - terminal tandem - repeat region as a new actin - targeting domain . MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of plasmids Standard protocols were used for all cDNA manipulations ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ) . PCR reactions for each clone , using Taq DNA polymerase , were performed using speciﬁc 5 ¢ - primers containing an Xba I site and corresponding 3 ¢ - primers containing a Bam HI site , using mouse uterus h 1 or h 2 CaP DNA or mouse uterus SM 22 DNA cloned into the vector pMW 172 as a template ( Strasser et al . , 1993 ) . All calponin constructs were cloned in - frame Xba I to Bam HI into the pCGN expression vector containing the HA - tag sequence at the 5 ¢ - end as described ( Gimona et al . , 1995 ) . All tagged constructs therefore represent amino - terminal fusion proteins . A stop codon was introduced at the 3 ¢ - end of each clone and all constructs were sequenced from both strands using a LI - Cor model 4000 automated sequencer ( MWG Biotech , Germany ) . Proteins Rabbit skeletal muscle actin and turkey gizzard mooth muscle actin were prepared from acetone powder according to Spudich and Watt ( 1971 ) and Strzelecka - Golaszewska et al . ( 1975 ) , respectively . Recombinant h 2 CaP ( 1 - 305 ) and three carboxy - terminal mutations ( 1 - 262 , 1 - 186 , 1 - 161 ) were expressed as non - fusions at high levels in E . coli and puriﬁed in a single chromatography step using an SP - HiTrap cation exchange column ( Pharmacia , Sweden ) . Lysates were generated by disrupting the bacterial cells in a French press as described earlier ( Strasser et al . , 1993 ) , resulting in more than 85 % of the expressed proteins in the soluble fraction . Soluble proteins after centrifugation at 15000 g were applied directely onto the SP column and eluted with a linear 20 mM to 400 mM NaCl gradient . Puriﬁed proteins were then dialysed into the appropriate assay buffers for co - sedimentation . Actin binding assays Co - sedimentation assays with smooth or skeletal muscle F - actin were performed in a buffer containing 20 mM imidazole , 50 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 0 . Proteins at a molar ratio of 1 : 3 ( recombinant protein : F - actin ) were incubated at 25°C for 30 minutes and pelleted at 100000 g for 30 minutes using an air - driven ultracentrifuge ( Beckman Instruments ) . Pellets were resuspended in the same buffer in the starting volume . Cell culture , transfection and immunoﬂuorescence microscopy NIH 3T3 and REF 52 ﬁbroblasts were grown in high glucose ( 4500 mg / l ) DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Hyclone , Utah , USA ) , penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco , Austria ) at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells at 70 % conﬂuence were transfected using the Lipofectamine ( Life Technologies , Austria ) method in the absence ( NIH 3T3 ) or presence ( REF 52 ) of serum , essentially as described ( Gimona et al . , 1995 ) . For transient expression , cells grown and transfected on 12 mm coverslips were screened 24 hours post - transfection by immunoﬂuorescence . Cells co - transfected with the plasmid pCDNA for the selection of stable cell lines were passaged after similar transfection times and cells resistant to 1 mg / ml G - 418 and expressing the transfected transgene were identiﬁed by western blotting . For immunoﬂuorescence microscopy cells were cultured on 12 mm glass coverslips . Cells were washed three times in PBS ( 138 mM NaCl , 26 mM KCl , 84 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 14 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) , extracted in 3 . 7 % PFA / 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 minutes . and ﬁxed in 3 . 7 % PFA ( Merck , Germany ) in PBS for 30 minutes . Tagged CaP fragments were visualised using the anti - tag antibody and GaM - rhodamine secondary antibody ( Jackson ) in PBS . Monoclonal anti - HA ( clone 12CA5 ) was described ( Gimona et al . , 1995 ) and produced as mouse ascites ﬂuid at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ( NY ) . Cy3 - labelled secondary ﬂuorescent antibodies were from Jackson Laboratories ( Dianova , Germany ) and FITC - phalloidin was a gift from Dr Faulstich ( Munich ) . Fluorescent images were recorded on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using a 63 · oil immersion lens and Kodak P3200 or P400 Tmax ﬁlm . Electrophoresis and western blotting : Analytical SDS - gel electrophoresis on 8 % to 22 % gradient polyacrylamide mini - slab gels and western blotting onto nitrocellulose ( Amersham ) was performed as described elsewhere ( Gimona et al . , 1990 ) . Transferred proteins were visualised using horseradish peroxidase - coupled secondary antibodies and the ECL chemiluminescence detection system ( Amersham ) . RESULTS Domains of calponin For the purpose of the present study we have divided CaP into four subdomains based on the data available for the h 1 variant ( Fig . 1 ) : ( 1 ) an amino - terminal CH domain ( CH ) ; ( 2 ) an actin - binding site ( ABS ) ; ( 3 ) three 29 - residue tandem repeats ; and ( 4 ) M . Gimona and R . Mital 1815 The CH domain in calponins a carboxy terminal tail . All three CaP variants display a high level of sequence identity along most of the length of the molecule , with the exception of the very carboxy - terminal residues , beyond the three repeats . In the region of h 2 CaP corresponding to the actin binding motif in h 1 and acidic CaP ( Fig . 2 ) there is , however , a cluster of several non - conservative amino acid exchanges . Notably , three exchanges ( A145S , R151N and K156T ) are unique for the h 2 variant . Mutation of Ala145 has been shown to strongly reduce the inhibitory activity of h 1 CaP on the actin - activated ATPase of myosin ( EL - Mezgueldi et al . , 1996 ) and Lys156 was identiﬁed as the residue most crucial for actin binding in chicken a - CaP ( Gong et al . , 1993 ) . Truncated constructs of h 1 and h 2 CaP were generated as indicated in Fig . 1 , and among these constructs all carboxy - terminal truncations of h 2 CaP as well as full - length SM 22 were additionally produced as recombinant , non - fusion proteins in E . coli for assays of actin binding in vitro . Actin binding Co - sedimentation assays using either skeletal or smooth muscle actin demonstrated that , like h 1 CaP , full - length ABS CH domain C - terminus 3 x 29 aa repeats N C ABS C - terminus 3 x 29 aa repeats C h2 / 1 - 305 h2 / 1 - 161 h2 / 1 - 186 h2 / 1 - 262 h1 / 1 - 228 h2 / 131 - 305 SM22 / 1 - 201 SM22 / 1 - 134 h1 / 1 - 297 h1 / 131 - 297 h2 / 1 - 305 h2 / 1 - 305 h2 / 1 - 161 h2 / 1 - 186 h2 / 1 - 262 h1 / 1 - 228 h2 / 131 - 305 SM22 / 1 - 201 h1 / 1 - 297 h1 / 131 - 297 c o - s e d i m e n t a t i o n h1 / 164 - 273 h1 / 1 - 127 h2 / 166 - 275 h2 / 1 - 127 + + + + - - + - + + + - - - - - + + - + + n . d . n . d . n . d . n . d . - n . d . n . d . s t re ss f i b re s c o n s t r u c t Fig . 1 .

Coomassie blue - stained 8 % - 22 % polyacrylamide gel showing soluble ( S ) and pelleted ( P ) material following high speed centriﬁgation at 100000 g . Smooth muscle actin was incubated with either native porcine calponin ( A ) or recombinant h 2 / 1 - 305 ( B ) , h 2 / 1 - 262 ( C ) , h 2 / 1 - 186 ( D ) , h 2 / 1 - 161 ( E ) or SM 22 ( F ) . H1 and h 2 CaP co - sediment with smooth muscle F - actin , as does the carboxy - terminal truncation h 2 / 1 - 262 . By contrast , recombinant SM 22 and the two h 2 constructs 1 - 186 and 1 - 161 remain in the supernatant . 1816 recombinant h 2 CaP ( h 2 / 1 - 305 ) and the fragment h 2 / 1 - 262 lacking the acidic carboxyl terminus pelleted together with F - actin after centrifugation at 100000 g for 30 minutes ( Fig . 3A - C ) . However , fragments h 2 / 1 - 186 and h 2 / 1 - 161 bearing further truncations at the carboxy - terminal end failed to co - sediment with F - actin under the same conditions ( Fig . 3D , E ) . Similarly , full - length recombinant SM 22 ( 1 - 201 ) did not co - sediment with either smooth ( Fig . 3F ) or skeletal muscle actin ( not shown ) . The addition of smooth muscle tropomyosin to the assay had no inﬂuence on the binding of either recombinant h 1 CaP , h 2 CaP or SM 22 ( M . Gimona and P . Strasser , unpublished ) . Increasing the ionic strength from 50 to 100 mM NaCl did not alter the co - sedimentation behaviour of any of the constructs . Expression and subcellular localization of h1 and h2 calponin Western blot analysis using the anti - HA tag antibody demonstrated that all constructs were expressed at low to intermediate levels ( Fig . 4 ) in transfected NIH 3T3 or REF 52 cell lines . The migration of the expressed proteins matched the estimated molecular masses of the tagged constructs , taken as 2 kDa heavier than the recombinant controls . Expression was further analysed by western blotting of two - dimensional gels containing whole - cell extracts of the various stable cell lines . The anti - tag antibody speciﬁcally recognised a single spot at the expected molecular size range and corresponding pI value . In contrast to native smooth muscle CaP , we did not observe multiple spots on 2D - gels for any of the transiently or stably expressing cell lines ( Gimona et al . , 1992 ; M . Gimona , unpublished observations ) . Full - length h 1 CaP ( h 1 / 1 - 297 ) was observed to decorate the actin stress ﬁbres of transiently transfected REF 52 cells ( Fig . 5A ) as did the shorter constructs h 1 / 1 - 228 ( Fig . 5B ) and h 1 / 131 - 297 ( Fig . 5C ) , demonstrating that truncation of either side of the actin - binding motif , involving in one case the complete deletion of the CH domain , does not affect actin association . As for h 1 CaP , full - length acidic CaP ( Fig . 6A ) and h 2 CaP ( Fig . 6C ) associated with the actin stress ﬁbres of transiently transfected REF 52 ﬁbroblasts , but were absent from the F - actin - containing lamellipodia at the cell periphery ( see Fig . 6C , D ) . In addition , h 2 CaP appeared to be more concentrated at the ends of stress ﬁbers . Deletion of the acidic carboxyl terminus from h 2 CaP enhanced the actin association and the corresponding construct ( h 2 / 1 - 262 ) decorated the entire length of the stress ﬁbres more homogeneously than the full - length molecule ( Fig . 6E ) . Further truncation of the h 2 CaP molecule from the carboxyl terminal end ( h 2 / 1 - 186 and h 2 / 1 - 161 ) almost completely abolished the ability of the respective constructs to associate with F - actin in transfected NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts ( Fig . 7A , C ) , although both constructs contained a complete CH domain . Immunoreactive material was also accumulated around and inside the nucleus . SM 22 was also diffusely localised in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 7E , F ) with an additional strong ﬂuorescent signal in the nuclear region . No stress ﬁbre association of SM 22 was obtained in transiently transfected REF 52 cells nor in any of the 16 M . Gimona and R . Mital Fig . 4 . Forced expression of CaP constructs .

A B C 1817 The CH domain in calponins independent stable clones generated in NIH 3T3 cells . Furthermore , a carboxy - terminal truncation of SM 22 ( SM 1 - 134 ) was found associated with vesicular structures ( Fig . 7G , H ) . Transient transfections of REF 52 cells with constructs including the amino terminus of h 1 CaP up to the end of the CH domain resulted in accumulation of the tagged protein fragment in endosomal and Golgi - like structures ( Fig . 8A ) . Notably , the same result was obtained with a hybrid construct that contained two CH domains in tandem ( Fig . 8B ) . By contrast , a construct composed of the three carboxyl terminal tandem repeats alone readily associated with actin stress ﬁbers ( Fig . 8C ) , an association that was as if this motif was duplicated ( Fig . 8D ) , indicating that the calponin repeats form an autonomous actin binding domain . DISCUSSION To investigate the functional signiﬁcance of two novel protein modules , namely the amino - terminal CH domain and the carboxy - terminal 29 - residue tandem repeats of calponin , we have compared the contribution of these domains to actin binding . We have included SM 22 in this analysis since it contains a single CH domain and one calponin - like carboxy - terminal repeat ( CLR ) , but lacks a consensus actin - binding motif as found in h 1 and acidic CaP . Thus , SM 22 was a suitable candidate for studying the targeting potential of the CH domain in a non - calponin molecule in vitro . We have shown previously ( North et al . , 1994 ) that the smooth muscle variant of calponin ( h 1 ) associates with both contractile ( g - smooth ) and cytoskeletal ( b - cytoplasmic ) actin Fig . 6 .

A B C D E F 1818 isoforms present in chicken gizzard muscle . Since b - cytoplasmic actin is the main actin isoform expressed in ﬁbroblasts the observed binding of the h 1 and h 2 CaP constructs to the actin cytoskeleton in NIH 3T3 and REF 52 ﬁbroblasts likely reﬂects an association with this non - muscle actin variant . Although the sequence spanning residues 142 - 163 in h 1 CaP constitutes an active F - actin binding site and a peptide comprising this sequence can be cross - linked to and co - sediments with F - actin in vitro ( Mezgueldi et al . , 1992 , 1995 ) , our ﬁndings show that the matching domain in h 2 CaP does not confer actin binding either in vitro or in cells in culture . Compared to the actin binding motifs in h 1 and acidic CaP , the domain in h 2 CaP differs in six and four positions , respectively , three of which appear to be signiﬁcant as regards actin binding activity . One of these residues , Lys156 in h 1 CaP ( Lys154 in the chicken a - CaP sequence ) , is critical for actin binding ( Gong et al . , 1993 ) and another , Ala145 , for conferring the inhibitory activity of CaP on the actin - activated myosin ATPase ( EL - Mezgueldi et al . , 1996 ) . Finally , the substitution M . Gimona and R . Mital Fig . 7 . The CH domain in h 2 CaP and SM 22 fails to mediate actin binding . Constructs h 2 / 1 - 186 ( A , B ) lacking two , and h 2 / 1 - 161 ( C , D ) lacking all three carboxy - terminal repeats , fail to colocalise with F - actin structures in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the respective construct . Immunoreactive material is detected throughout the cytoplasm and also in the nucleus . A similar non - speciﬁc cytoplasmic distribution is found for full - length SM 22 ( E , F ) . A carboxy - terminal truncation of SM 22 containing only the sequences corresponding to the CH domain in SM 22 and comprising residues 1 - 134 , but missing the CaP - like repeat , is found accumulated in vesicular structures throughout the cytoplasm .

A B C D E F G H 1819 The CH domain in calponins of Arg151 to Asn removes a positive charge from this region in h 2 CaP . Our data are consistent with this region in h 2 calponin being inactive in actin binding . While calponin and calponin - related proteins contain a single CH domain , two adjacent domains of this type are found in the actin binding domains of a - actinin , ﬁlamin , spectrin and ﬁmbrin ( Castresana and Saraste , 1995 ; Matsudaira , 1991 ; Pollard et al . , 1994 ) . From their X - ray crystal data , Carugo et al . ( 1997 ) proposed that both CH domains of spectrin contribute to F - actin binding and suggested that the juxtaposed amino - and carboxy - terminal helices of these two domains play a signiﬁcant role in this interaction . The partial similarities in sequence and , more strikingly , in the predicted three - dimensional folding of the CH domains ( McGough et al . , 1994 ; Carugo et al . , 1997 ; Goldsmith et al . , 1997 ) with molecules involved in Rac and Cdc 42 signaling , like IQGAP 1 and 2 , and Vav ( Castresana and Saraste , 1995 ; Romero and Fischer , 1996 ) , have now fueled speculations about a CH domain - mediated binding of these molecules to F - actin , thereby linking signal transduction events directly to the actin cytoskeleton ( Hart et al . , 1996 ; Brill et al . , 1996 ) . Consistent with this general idea , Bashour et al . ( 1997 ) recently demonstrated an association of IQGAP 1 with microﬁlaments in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles , but not with stress ﬁbres of cultured cells , and Fukata et al . ( 1997 ) further conﬁrmed the potential of IQGAP 1 to cross - link F - actin in vitro . Like calponin , however , these signalling molecules possess only one CH domain at their amino - terminal ends . Single CH domains likewise exist in the calponin - related proteins mp - 20 , np 25 and SM 22 . Similar to the results obtained with constructs of h 1 and h 2 calponin containing only the CH domain , we were unable to detect a direct association with F - actin for both full - length SM 22 ( not shown ) and the construct SM 22 / 1 - 134 in in vitro co - sedimentation and cell transfection assays . Furthermore , a construct containing two CH domains in tandem , mimicking an artiﬁcial actin binding - site , similar to that found in a - actinin and ﬁlamin , also failed to target stress ﬁbers in transfected REF 52 ﬁbroblasts . Taken together , our results support the assumptions that ( 1 ) the presence of a single CH domain is not sufficient for the association with actin stress ﬁbres of calponin in vivo and / or ( 2 ) the signiﬁcant divergence in sequence between the individual CH domains of the different CH domain - containing proteins reﬂect functional differences of this protein module ( T . Stradal , W . Kranewitter , S . J . Winder and M . Gimona , manuscript in preparation ) . It is , however , conceivable that the region embracing the CH domain in CaP and other single CH domain - containing proteins cooperates with a second site in thin ﬁlament - binding . This is also suggested by density maps of reconstituted thin ﬁlaments ( Hodgkinson et al . , 1997 ) , which show that the CH domain of CaP occupies a position along the actin ﬁlament identical to that observed for spectrin ( Schutt et al . , 1997 ) and ﬁmbrin ( Hanein et al . , 1997 ) . In light of our data one may therefore speculate that F - actin association via a CH domain requires cooperativity with either a second CH domain , a tandem - repeat domain , or other domains containing a polycationic stretch like those found in PH domains ( see Musacchio et al . , 1993 ) . Thus , CH domains may deﬁne a novel family of weak actin - binding modules , which act synergistically with other modules to mediate F - actin binding . Although constructs of h 1 and h 2 CaP containing only the Fig . 8 . The tandem repeats but not the single CH domains target to actin stress ﬁbres .

Neither the single CH domain ( A ) nor a construct containing the h 1 CaP CH domain in tandem ( B ) associate with the actin cytoskeleton and immunoreactive material is concentrated in vesicular structures throughout the cell . By contrast the isolated tandem repeats ( B ) associate with the actin stress ﬁbres , and this association is also retained in a duplication construct ( D ) containing six of the calponin repeats ( see also Discussion ) .

A B C D 1820 amino - terminal part of the calponin molecule , embracing the CH domain , failed to associate with F - actin , those that included the carboxy - terminal tandem - repeat sequences retained their actin - binding ability . Moreover , the interaction of the isolated calponin tandem - repeat region spanning residues 164 - 273 of h 1 CaP with actin ﬁlaments identiﬁes this region as a hitherto unrecognised actin - binding domain in h 1 CaP . This conclusion is further supported by our ﬁndings that proteins like SM 22 associate with F - actin in transfected ﬁbroblasts when fused to the calponin tandem - repeat motif ( R . Mital and M . Gimona , manuscript in preparation ) . Notably , the product of the unc - 87 gene from C . elegans has no recognisable actin - binding domain , but contains seven copies of the calponin - like repeats , suggesting that these CLRs are responsible for the observed association of the UNC - 87 protein with sarcomeric actin - containing structures ( Goetinck and Waterston , 1994b ) . While this manuscript was under revision , Mino and colleagues ( Mino et al . , 1998 ) demonstrated that a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 172 - 187 of the h 1 CaP sequence binds to F - actin in vitro but does not inhibit the actin - activated ATPase activity of myosin , and the authors propose , in agreement with our data , a second independent actin binding site in smooth muscle calponin proximal to the actin binding motif identiﬁed earlier .
