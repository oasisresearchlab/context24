In mammals , iron homeostasis is meticulously regulated ; extracellular free iron is essen - tially unavailable and host iron availability has a crucial role in the host – pathogen relationship . Therefore , patho - gens use specialized and effective mechanisms to acquire iron . In this review , we summarize the iron - uptake systems in eukaryotic unicellular organisms with particular focus on the pathogenic species : Candida albicans , Tritrichomonas foetus , Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania spp . We describe the diversity of their iron - uptake mechanisms and highlight the importance of the process for virulence . The crusade for iron Iron is an essential nutrient for almost all living organ - isms . Its importance originates from the ﬂexibility of redox potentials available to iron by its varied interactions with coordinating ligands and from its capacity to undergo electron transfer and acid – base reactions [ 1 ] . Iron is a co - factor of a variety of proteins that can be classiﬁed according to the coordination chemistry of the metal : ( i ) haemoproteins , which function as O 2 carriers , O 2 activa - tors or electron - transfer proteins ; ( ii ) iron – sulfur cluster ( ISC ) proteins , involved mainly in electron transfer ; and ( iii ) non - haem , non - iron – sulfur , iron - containing proteins , including enzymes and proteins involved in iron transport and storage [ 1 ] . Host - iron availability has a crucial role in the host – pathogen relationship . As a general anti - microbial defence mechanism , mammals possess an elaborate iron - withhold - ing system that effectively reduces the amount of iron accessible to pathogenic microorganisms . Iron is predomi - nantly intracellular , and the limited amount of extracellu - lar iron is tightly bound to proteins such as transferrin and lactoferrin [ 2 ] . Therefore , invading pathogens use special - ized and effective mechanisms to acquire iron , and iron availability is often found to have an important role in virulence . Some potential invaders that have impaired iron - acquisition ability cause disease primarily in iron - loaded hosts [ 3 ] . Unlike that in pathogenic bacteria , little is known about iron uptake and its intracellular metabolism in unicellular eukaryotic pathogens . Here , we summarize the available knowledge on iron uptake in : Candida albicans , a pathogenic organism related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Tritrichomonas foe - tus , a parasitic protist with a high requirement for iron ; Leishmania spp . , another group of parasites with both intra - and extra - cellular parts of their life cycles ; and , ﬁnally , Trypanosoma brucei , a ﬂagellate parasite that dis - plays unique expression of transferrin receptor genes . Although they are not evolutionarily closely related , these organisms share several features regarding iron metab - olism : ( i ) they are unicellular , taking up iron from their environment and not re - distributing iron between cells ; ( ii ) they have no classical ferritin for iron storage ; ( iii ) they are eukaryotic , with iron being delivered and / or stored in various organelles ; and ( iv ) they are pathogens and need to ‘ﬁght’ for nutrients in a harsh , iron - limited host environ - ment . Moreover , they often occupy diverse niches during their life cycle , such as different tissues or even different organisms during transmission between the host and vec - tor . Hence , these pathogens require multiple uptake sys - tems for a variety of iron sources . These particular organisms were deliberately chosen as examples because they represent some of the most well characterized uni - cellular eukaryotic pathogens in terms of iron - assimilation mechanisms . Metabolism of iron in mammalian cells To ensure iron availability and to eliminate the toxicity of free iron in addition to its accessibility for invading patho - gens , mammals have evolved a strictly regulated system for iron homeostasis ( for review , see Ref . [ 2 ] ) . Free iron is essentially unavailable in blood and extracellular ﬂuids . In plasma , circulating iron is bound to transferrin , whereas , in external secretions such as colostrum , iron is bound to lactoferrin [ 2 ] . The uptake of diferric transferrin is mediated by transferrin receptor - 1 ( TfR1 ) , which facilitates the internalization of the transferrin – TfR1 complex through endocytosis [ 2 ] . Iron is released in early endosomes that are acidiﬁed by a proton pump , which reduces the pH to (cid:2) 5 . 5 , resulting in dissociation of iron from transferrin [ 2 ] . The metal ion is then transported through the endosomal membrane via the divalent metal ion transporter 1 ( DMT1 ) Review Corresponding author : Richardson , D . R .

Once within the cytosol , excess iron is stored within ferritin , a polymer of 24 subunits that forms a cage - like structure that is capable of containing up to 4500 iron atoms [ 5 ] . More recently , a mitochondrial ferritin has been ident - iﬁed [ 6 ] , although its biological role is unclear . The only cellular iron exporter that has been identiﬁed under phys - iological conditions is ferroportin - 1 [ 7 ] , a transporter at the plasma membrane that transports iron to the extracellular space . Iron metabolism is meticulously regulated and this is ensured , in part , by two iron regulatory proteins [ 8 ] . These molecules bind to iron - responsive elements ( IREs ) of mRNAs that encode proteins involved in iron uptake ( TfR1 and DMT1 ) , utilization ( erythroid d - aminolevulinic acid synthase ) , storage ( ferritin ) and export ( ferroportin - 1 ) . Another key player in the regulation of systemic iron homeostasis is the circulating peptide hormone hepcidin [ 9 ] . Hepcidin regulates cellular iron efﬂux by binding to ferroportin - 1 and inducing its internalization [ 2 ] . Pathogenic microorganisms use two general strategies for iron acquisition from the host environment . The ﬁrst depends on direct contact between the pathogen and the host iron source and , mostly , iron is released from the protein extracellularly [ 10 , 11 ] . The second strategy uses secretion and subsequent uptake of small iron - binding molecules called siderophores ( Figure 1 ) , which are able to remove iron from host protein – iron complexes because of their high - afﬁnity for the metal [ 10 , 11 ] . The competition for iron between the host and the pathogen is an exciting and complex phenomenon , which includes a variety of different tactics on both sides . Indeed , this can be seen from the fact that , although lactoferrin has anti - microbial activity , it serves as an iron source for many microbes [ 12 ] . In response to poor iron availability in the host , pathogens produce siderophores to take the element from host proteins . In response , the mammalian protein lipocalin - 2 binds to several kinds of siderophores , prevent - ing the pathogen from accessing siderophore - bound iron [ 13 ] . However , to evade this strategy , some bacteria pro - duce a glycosylated form of the siderophore enterobactin , preventing its sequestration by lipocalin - 2 [ 14 ] . The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans A wide variety of unicellular ( yeasts ) and ﬁlamentous fungi ( Box 1 ) have developed sophisticated mechanisms of iron uptake [ 10 ] . Among these organisms , C . albicans is the object of numerous studies because it is an important opportunistic human pathogen . The non - pathogenic yeast , S . cerevisiae , has long been used as a model to study eukaryotic iron metabolism ( Figure 2 ) and several exten - sive reviews are devoted to iron metabolism in this organ - ism ( e . g . see Refs [ 15 – 17 ] ) . Studies based mainly on the search for S . cerevisiae homologues and functional comple - mentation of the corresponding S . cerevisiae mutants led to the identiﬁcation of two main strategies of iron uptake in C . albicans : reductive and non - reductive ( siderophore - mediated ) [ 18 – 20 ] . A third mechanism of iron import and haem uptake has been identiﬁed in C . albicans but not S . cerevisiae [ 21 , 22 ] . These three mechanisms are ﬁnely regulated at the transcriptional level , according to iron availability . As in most fungi ( but not in the model yeast S . cerevisiae ) , transcriptional regulation of the ‘iron regulon’ in C . albicans is mediated by a GATA - type repression factor ( Sfu1 ) [ 23 , 24 ] . Another molecule , Tup1 , a global regulator of morphology and metabolism , also has a major role in iron - dependent gene regulation and acts differently on genes involved in reductive and in non - reductive iron uptake [ 19 , 25 ] . Considering the role of Tup1 , it can be hypothesized that different iron - uptake systems might be Figure 1 . Hydroxamate - type siderophores . Low - molecular weight ( < 1500 Da ) ferric - specific chelates produced by microorganisms under iron limitation are called siderophores . Siderophores can be divided into different classes depending on the chemical nature of the oxygen ligand moieties responsible for Fe ( III ) coordination . These are catecholates , hydroxamates or hydroxycarboxylates . The siderophores synthesized and / or used by most fungi are mainly hydroxamates [ 68 ] . Box 1 . Iron acquisition by fungi Among fungi , species with yeast and filamentous forms are found in different phyla . Several species are pathogenic in humans , espe - cially for individuals with impaired immunity . These organisms live in a broad range of ecological niches , and often exhibit life cycles whereby unicellular forms alternate with mycelius ( or filamentous ) forms . Iron - acquisition strategies of fungi essentially consist of siderophore production and / or use , reductive iron - uptake and haem - uptake systems [ 16 ] . Some species are siderophore - generat - ing ( i . e . Aspergillus , Neurospora , Schizosaccharomyces , Rhodotor - ula and Ustilago ) , whereas others are not ( i . e . Saccharomyce s , Candida and Pichia ) [ 33 ] . It has long been thought that only siderophore - generating fungi are able to take up iron in the form of their own native siderophores . However , it is now recognized that many species , including those that cannot produce any side - rophores , can take up xenosiderophores , that is , siderophores produced by other species ( bacteria and fungi ) [ 33 ] . Siderophore production is not directly related to pathogenicity . Some non - pathogenic fungi can produce siderophores ( e . g . Schi - zosaccharomyces pombe ) [ 73 ] and some pathogenic species cannot produce siderophores ( e . g . Candida albicans ) [ 33 ] . However , when a siderophore - producing species is pathogenic , the synthesis of these chelators is often required for virulence ( e . g . Aspergillus fumigatus ) [ 66 ] . The reductive iron - uptake system ( see description in the section ‘the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans ’ in the main text ) was first described in Saccharomyce s cerevisiae as an alternative mechanism to the siderophore - uptake strategy [ 74 ] . Further studies showed that this uptake system is present in most fungi and can be required for virulence ( e . g . in C . albicans and Cryptococcus neofor - mans ) [ 18 ] . This is a well - conserved copper - dependent iron - uptake system , which is also found in higher eukaryotes and enables cells to acquire iron from almost all extracellular ferric complexes , except haem . Haem uptake is probably a widespread mechanism of iron acquisition in pathogenic fungi , but it is still poorly documented . Iron use from haem requires the porphyrin ring to be opened via a reaction catalysed by haem oxygenase [ 75 ] because iron cannot be removed from this molecule by reduction . Review Trends in Microbiology Vol . 16 No . 6 262 used according to the morphological form of C . albicans ( yeast or ﬁlamentous form ) . Reductive iron uptake by yeasts : coupling speciﬁc permeation to non - speciﬁc reduction of iron S . cerevisiae employs two systems of iron acquisition , namely a low - and high - afﬁnity iron - uptake mechanism [ 15 ] ( Figure 2 ) . The utilization of each system is dependent on the availability of iron in the environment [ 26 ] . For both systems , the ﬁrst step involves reduction of iron by ferrir - eductases ( Fre1 and Fre2 proteins ) that are plasma mem - brane ﬂavo - haemo - proteins capable of reducing a wide variety of ferric complexes , including siderophores [ 15 , 27 ] . This is a low - speciﬁcity and low - afﬁnity step , which enables cells to convert structurally diverse extra - cellular ferric complexes into the common ferrous state [ 16 ] . When extracellular iron is in excess , a non - ATP - de - pendent trans - membrane transporter ( Fet4 ) is the main component of the low - afﬁnity transport mechanism [ 28 ] ( Figure 2 ) . The Fet4 - dependent low - afﬁnity transport sys - tem found in S . cerevisiae does not seem to be present in C . albicans , probably because the metabolism of the latter is based upon respiration ( and not fermentation ) , whereas Fet4 is mainly required under anaerobic conditions [ 29 ] . By contrast , when iron is limiting , the high - afﬁnity system is used , which involves an oxidase – permease complex composed of the Fet3 and Ftr1 proteins in the plasma membrane [ 10 ] . The Fet3 component of the Fet3 – Ftr1 complex is a multi - copper ferroxidase that converts ferrous to ferric iron [ 26 ] , and Ftr1 is a permease necessary for high - afﬁnity iron uptake [ 30 ] ( Figure 2 ) . Biogenesis of Fet3 in the late - or post - Golgi compartment requires efﬁcient copper uptake by cells ( mediated by the Fre reductases and the cuprous permease , Ctr1 ) and the activity of an intracellular cupric transporter ( Ccc2 ) [ 21 , 31 ] . Therefore , mutants lacking Ctr1 or Ccc2 copper transport activity are defective in high - afﬁnity reductive iron import [ 21 , 32 ] . Figure 2 . Iron - uptake mechanisms in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . During reductive uptake , extracellular ferric complexes are reduced by the ferrireductases ( Fre1 and Fre2 ) and the ferrous iron that is released is taken up via the low - affinity divalent metal permease ( Fet4 ) or via the high - affinity oxidase – permease system ( Fet3 – Ftr1 ) , which requires copper as a co - factorof Fet3 . Extracellular cupricions ( Cu 2 + ) are reduced by the same reductases ( Fre1 or 2 ) and the cuprous ions enter the cell via Ctr1 . Intracellular copper participates in the biogenesis of Fet3 in a post - Golgi compartment . Intracellular iron is stored in the vacuole , from which it can be mobilized by a similar reductive mechanism involving homologous proteins ( i . e . Fre6 , Fet5 and Fth1 ) . ‘Ligands’ are chemical moieties that bind to ferric iron to form coordination complexes , which can be labilized by iron reduction ( with the notable exception of haem , for which the ligands have nearly the same affinity for ferric and for ferrous iron ) . Blue arrows represent the fate of proteins ; green arrows represent the fate of elements . Abbreviations : HA , high - affinity iron uptake ; LA , low - affinity iron uptake . During non - reductive uptake , siderophore transporters ( Sit1 , Arn1 , Arn2 and Enb1 ) mediate the uptake of various siderophores ( FOB , ferrioxamine B ; FCH , ferrichrome ; TAF , triacetylfusarinine ; ENB , enterobactin ) . Some siderophore transporters ( e . g . Sit1 and Arn1 ) cycle from endosomes to the vacuole , where they are degraded , whereas other transporters become targeted to the plasma membrane if their specific substrates are sensed by the cell . Review Trends in Microbiology Vol . 16 No . 6 263 In the reductive strategy of iron uptake , an apparent paradox is that iron has to be reduced ( via Fre ) before being re - oxidized ( via Fet3 ) to enter the cell ( via Ftr1 ) [ 15 , 30 ] . However , this reduction and oxidation of iron does not result in a futile cycle . Ferroxidation – permeation is a well conserved process involved in iron transport across mem - branes [ 10 , 15 ] . The role of the reduction step is most probably to release iron from its ferric ligands in such a way that the cells can acquire iron from a broad variety of ferric compounds with only one high - afﬁnity uptake sys - tem [ 15 ] . Non - reductive uptake of siderophores by yeasts : an opportunistic strategy C . albicans has a speciﬁc transporter for ferrichrome - type siderophores , Arn1 ( also known as Sit1 ) ( Figure 2 ) , but it is probably unable to produce its own siderophores because it lacks the genes required for hydroxamate ligand biosyn - thesis [ 33 ] . Similarly to S . cerevisiae , C . albicans can use siderophores produced by other microorganisms [ 34 ] . This opportunistic strategy of iron uptake might be important in some ecological niches where several microorganisms co - exist . Siderophore transporters in fungi are well - conserved integral membrane proteins ( with 13 or 14 potential mem - brane - spanning regions ) that bind to speciﬁc siderophores and mediate their import in a high - afﬁnity uptake process [ 10 ] ( Figure 2 ) . However , the mechanism of siderophore import is still poorly understood . It is unclear whether the siderophore transporter functions as a classical permease or as a siderophore receptor that enters the cell by endo - cytosis after binding to its speciﬁc substrate [ 35 , 36 ] . In S . cerevisiae , some siderophore transporters accumulate in post - Golgi compartments and are targeted to the plasma membrane in response to the presence of their speciﬁc substrate in the extracellular medium [ 17 ] . By contrast , other siderophore transporters are constitutively targeted to the plasma membrane [ 17 ] . This latter scenario seems to prevail for the Arn1 transporter of C . albicans [ 35 ] . The intracellular fate of siderophores is largely unknown and remains an important area of research . Intracellular iron release from the siderophores probably occurs by reduction in an acidic environment , which makes the vacuole a good candidate for this process . Iron uptake and virulence of yeasts During systemic infection , possible iron sources for C . albicans are haem and transferrin . This pathogen was shown to produce haemolytic factors [ 37 ] and is able to use haem as an iron source [ 21 , 22 ] . The enzyme , haem oxygenase ( Hmx1 ) , which is regulated by haemoglobin and iron , is required for iron assimilation from haemin [ 22 , 38 ] . Moreover , surface haem - binding proteins involved in haemin and haemoglobin - iron utilization have been identiﬁed [ 39 ] . The role of haem uptake in virulence and the mechanism of haem import remain poorly understood . Transferrin has also been shown to be an iron source for C . albicans [ 40 ] . In fact , iron uptake from transferrin was shown to occur via the reductive pathway , but nothing is known about the mechanism of how this protein is recognized by Candida and how it crosses the cell wall [ 40 ] . Although the iron - uptake systems in Candida seem somewhat redundant ( at least three high - afﬁnity iron - uptake systems ) , particular components of at least two of them might be essential for successful development of infection in the host [ 18 , 41 ] . While deletion of the high - afﬁnity iron permease gene ( FTR1 ) abolished the capacity of Candida to establish systemic infection in mice [ 18 ] , siderophore uptake mediated by the Arn1 transporter was required for colonizing epithelial layers , but not in the infection of the bloodstream [ 41 ] . It is probable that the three different iron - uptake systems help Candida to cope with the variability of iron abundance and form in different environments during infection . Tritrichomonas foetus T . foetus is a bovine parasitic protist that is the causative agent of bovine trichomoniasis , which is a sexually trans - mitted disease leading to abortion and eventually to per - manent infertility [ 42 ] . This organism has high requirements for extracellular iron ( 50 – 100 m M ) [ 43 ] , prob - ably owing to the importance of ISC proteins such as ferredoxin , pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase and hydro - genase in pyruvate metabolism [ 44 ] . The core metabolic pathway in which ISC proteins are involved takes place in the hydrogenosome , an ATP - producing double - membrane - bound organelle . Iron availability markedly inﬂuences carbohydrate metabolism of T . foetus . Under iron - restricted conditions , hydrogenosomal metabolism dramatically decreases and the dominant product of glu - cose breakdown becomes ethanol [ 44 ] . The cells then become sensitive to omeprazole , an inhibitor of pyruvate decarboxylase [ 45 ] . Pyruvate decarboxylase is the rate - limiting enzyme in the production of ethanol , which is overexpressed in iron - restricted T . foetus cells [ 45 ] . Involvement of iron in the virulence of T . foetus has been examined in an experimental mouse infection by the moderately virulent KV - 1 strain of this organism ( (cid:2) 5 % mortality rate ) [ 46 ] . Administration of ferric ammonium citrate to infected mice increased the mortality rate up to a level determined for the highly virulent LUB - 1MIP strain ( (cid:2) 80 % mortality rate ) [ 46 ] . Consistent with this obser - vation , the strain with lower virulence clearly showed lower efﬁciency in accumulating iron [ 46 ] . T . foetus is able to take up and use iron from a wide range of sources ( Figure 3 ) . In an initial study , it was shown that the cells bind both lactoferrin and transferrin , but only the binding of lactoferrin to the cell surface is inhibited by an excess of unlabelled protein , indicating a receptor - mediated process [ 47 ] . Further investigations demonstrated that iron uptake from these proteins is mediated by two different systems . Iron uptake from lac - toferrin is mediated by endocytosis , whereas iron acqui - sition from transferrin occurs via extracellular release , probably by acidiﬁcation of the cell micro - environment [ 43 ] ( Figure 3 ) . The dynamics and properties of iron uptake from transferrin are similar to those from the low molecu - lar weight chelate , iron – nitrilotriacetic acid [ 48 ] . Iron from low molecular weight complexes is ﬁrst reduced to divalent iron at the plasma membrane or in the reducing environ - ment of the cell , and is then taken up by a transport system with a dissociation constant of 2 . 7 m M [ 48 ] ( Figure 3 ) . Review Trends in Microbiology Vol . 16 No . 6 264 Interestingly , this uptake mechanism was shown not to be iron - regulated . Moreover , it was demonstrated that T . foetus also acquires iron from various siderophores by a non - speciﬁc and non - saturable mechanism , which prob - ably involves pinocytosis and removal of iron from side - rophores in acidic intracellular vesicles [ 49 ] ( Figure 3 ) . T . foetus is also able to use iron from haem , probably in a process involving haem oxygenase because traces of bili - verdin ( a by - product of haem breakdown ) are found in the growth medium when haemin is the iron source [ 49 ] . Similar sources of iron can be used by the related human parasite , Trichomonas vaginalis , which causes one of the most frequent sexually transmitted diseases worldwide , trichomoniasis [ 42 ] . The growth of the parasite has been shown to be supported by low molecular weight iron , lactoferrin , haemoglobin , cytochrome c and ferritin , but not transferrin [ 50 ] . Speciﬁc receptor - mediated binding was suggested for lactoferrin and haemoglobin [ 50 , 51 ] . However , the mechanisms of iron release from the host proteins and its uptake has not been studied in detail . In conclusion , the metabolism and virulence of T . foetus strongly depends on iron availability and , paradoxically , this parasite seems to lack an iron - regulated high - afﬁnity system for iron uptake . This is probably compensated by the ability of the pathogen to use a large variety of iron sources in its environment . Trypanosoma brucei T . brucei is a parasite responsible for the fatal disease known as sleeping sickness in humans and Nagana in domestic livestock in Africa [ 42 ] . These ﬂagellated protists are transmitted between mammalian hosts by the tsetse ﬂy , Glossina spp . [ 42 ] . After transmission , they reside ﬁrst in the bloodstream , lymphatic system and interstitial spaces and then , during the latter stages of infection , in the central nervous system [ 42 ] . African trypanosomes obtain iron from host transferrin [ 52 ] . The uptake occurs in the ﬂagellar pocket and is mediated by a hetero - dimeric glycosylphosphatidylinosi - tol - anchored receptor consisting of subunits encoded by expression site - associated genes ESAG - 6 and ESAG - 7 [ 52 ] . These genes are located in poly - cistronic transcription units called variant surface glycoprotein ( VSG ) expression sites and are co - transcribed with a gene encoding the VSG protein , forming the surface coat of the parasite [ 52 ] . During chronic infection , T . brucei evades the mammalian immune response by continuously changing a homo - geneous VSG coat . T . brucei has (cid:2) 20 VSG expression sites , only one of which is fully active at a time , and each expression site seems to contain functional copies of the ESAG - 6 and ESAG - 7 genes [ 53 , 54 ] . The transferrin recep - tors encoded by different expression sites vary in their afﬁnities for transferrin from different host species , and switching between expression sites probably helps trypa - nosomes cope with the diversity of transferrins in the hosts they colonize . Indeed , cultivation of trypanosomes expres - sing a receptor with low - afﬁnity for canine transferrin in canine serum results in selection of trypanosomes expres - sing transferrin receptor with higher afﬁnity for canine transferrin [ 55 ] . However , it is not clear whether trypano - somes with low - afﬁnity transferrin receptors need to switch to another expression site encoding a high - afﬁnity receptor to take up sufﬁcient iron for growth in vivo . When dissociation constant values of transferrin recep - tors and the concentration of serum transferrin are com - pared and considered in conjunction with the iron requirements of the trypanosome , it seems unlikely that the bloodstream form of this parasite would be iron - deprived [ 56 ] . It can be hypothesized that high - afﬁnity transferrin receptors are important to enable sufﬁcient iron uptake in the presence of antibodies against transfer - rin receptors formed in a chronic trypanosome infection . However , a recent study examining the host immune response during chronic murine trypanosomiasis showed that anti - transferrin receptor antibody titres are probably too low to prevent sufﬁcient iron uptake by the parasites [ 57 ] . Nevertheless , sensing iron levels is effective in try - panosomes . Within 3 h of transferrin starvation ( i . e . within half a division time ) , an increase in the synthesis Figure 3 . Proposed mechanism of iron uptake by Tritrichomonas foetus from various sources . Iron from transferrin ( Tf ) and non - siderophore , non - haem , low - molecular weight complexes ( L – M – W ) are released in the reducing , acidic environment of the cells and free iron is taken up by an unknown transport system ( T ) . Iron from lactoferrin ( Lf ) is acquired via endocytosis mediated by a specific binding protein ( BP ) . Siderophore - bound iron is non - specifically pinocytosed . Both lactoferrin - and siderophore - bound iron is released within acidic intracellular vesicles . Review Trends in Microbiology Vol . 16 No . 6 265 of transferrin receptor is detectable [ 58 ] . Surprisingly , there is no information about iron uptake in the host vector , although it is likely that trypanosomes have to adapt to different iron conditions when they switch from the mammalian to insect host . Leishmania Leishmania are trypanosomatid parasites that cause leish - maniasis , a complex of diseases that afﬂict > 12 million people [ 42 ] . Leishmania spp . are digenetic parasites requiring a sand ﬂy vector and a mammalian host to complete their life cycle [ 42 ] . Amastigotes ( non - motile intracellular forms ) live inside the phago - lysosomal system of mammalian macrophages , whereas promastigotes ( motile extracellular forms ) multiply in the sand ﬂy gut [ 42 ] . As expected from the diversity of the environments Leishmania encounters during its life cycle , this parasite is able to use iron from several sources , such as transferrin , lactoferrin or haemin [ 59 ] . Investigation of iron uptake in Leishmania chagasi promastigotes showed non - speciﬁc binding of transferrin and lactoferrin to the organism [ 60 ] . Promastigotes preferentially acquire iron in a reduced , rather than an oxidized , form [ 60 ] . In addition , NADPH - dependent iron reductase activity has been detected in Leishmania , indicating reductase - dependent iron uptake from transferrin and lactoferrin [ 60 ] . In contrast to transferrin and lactoferrin , haemoglobin binds to L . donovani promastigotes in a saturable manner via a speciﬁc receptor , the binding being independent of the presence of transferrin , haemocyanin or myoglobin [ 61 ] . Furthermore , free globin , haemin and haem - containing a - and b - chains of haemoglobin do not compete with the binding , indicating that the receptor recognizes holo - haemoglobin only [ 61 ] . Following initial binding to the sites localized within the ﬂagellar pocket , haemoglobin is rapidly internalized [ 61 ] . The endocytosis of haemo - globin is regulated by small GTP - binding proteins of the Rab family [ 62 ] . Furthermore , the fusion of early endo - somes containing haemoglobin with late endosomes requires a signal mediated through the cytoplasmic tail of the haemoglobin receptor [ 62 ] . Besides haemoglobin binding , there is evidence for the existence of a receptor on Leishmania mexicana that facilitates binding of haem or other metalloporphyrin compounds to promastigote cells [ 63 ] . The presence of such systems in Leishmania is consistent with the fact that this parasite lacks a com - plete haem biosynthetic pathway and must acquire this essential nutrient from exogenous sources . Duringthe intracellular stageofits lifecycle , Leishmania has to deal with the harsh environment of the mammalian phagolysosome . Divalent metal ions are thought to be removed from the phagolysosome by the natural resist - ance - associated macrophage protein 1 ( Nramp1 ) transpor - ter [ 64 ] . This protein inﬂuences the susceptibility of mammalian cells to intracellular pathogens [ 64 ] . In such an iron - restricted environment , it can be hypothesized that Leishmania amastigotes possess a highly effective iron - uptake system . Indeed , in a recent study , the Leishmania iron transporter ( LIT ) member of the ZIP ( Zrt , Irt - like protein ) family of ferrous iron transporters LIT1 was described in Leishmania amazonensis [ 65 ] . Thistransporter is detectable only in amastigotes that replicate intracellu - larly and is essential for the development of pathogenic lesions in mice , but dispensable for growth and differen - tiation in axenic culture [ 65 ] . Concluding remarks and future perspectives Our knowledge of iron - uptake mechanisms by fungi has improved markedly in the past few years and this is largely owing to the use of the yeast S . cerevisiae as a tool . This easy to manipulate microorganism has proven to be a good model for both reductive and non - reductive iron uptake . Certainly , a better understanding of the molecular mech - anisms involved in siderophore uptake by pathogenic fungi should lead to the development of new anti - fungal agents . These could be based on the inhibition of siderophore synthesis [ 66 ] or on the ‘trojan horse approach’ , which consists of coupling anti - fungal drugs with siderophores , enhancing drug accumulation within pathogenic cells [ 67 ] . This therapeutic strategy was recently shown to be unsuc - cessful using S . cerevisiae [ 35 ] , probably because this yeast tightly compartmentalizes intracellular siderophores within the vacuole , preventing the siderophore – drug con - jugate reaching its target . However , this same approach could be promising considering the many fungi that seem to use intracellular siderophores as cytosolic iron - storage depots [ 68 ] . Far less is known about iron uptake in parasitic protists , although substantial progress has been achieved in the understanding of these mechanisms ; for example , in Leish - mania , for which iron - transport systems have been described for both the intra - and extra - cellular forms of the organism . However , despite the importance of effective iron uptake for virulence , surprisingly little is known about iron acquisition in other unicellular eukaryotic pathogens , especially those with serious medical implications . For instance , there is very limited information available on iron uptake by Trypanosoma cruzi . This ﬂagellate parasite is a causative agent of Chagas disease , which has an estimated infection prevalence of 13 million [ 42 ] . Here , we have not described the mechanisms of iron assimilation of Plasmodium , the most important human parasitic protist , because the subject remains controversial and requires a separate detailed analysis that is beyond the scope of this review . In fact , the exact source of iron for Plasmodium growth remains unclear , although the importance of iron for its survival is evident because several iron chelators have anti - malarial activity [ 69 ] . The abundance of haemoglobin in erythrocytes , where Plasmodium spends the major part of its life cycle , makes this protein the most probable iron source , but this still remains unclear . In addition , the presence of haem oxyge - nase , which is required for the effective release of iron from haem , has never been conﬁrmed in this parasite . Moreover , the stable end - product of haem catabolism in Plasmodium , hemozoin , does not seem to be metabolically available because it is an insoluble complex of haem units [ 70 ] . Another mystery of unicellular eukaryote iron metab - olism is iron storage . Once the cell takes up iron , it must be safely sequestered because it can participate in the gener - ation of reactive oxygen species . In most organisms , this is Review Trends in Microbiology Vol . 16 No . 6 266 ensured by iron - storage proteins , mainly ferritin [ 5 ] . The majority of unicellular eukaryotes , such as yeast and parasitic protists , do not possess ferritin , thus the mech - anism of intracellular iron storage in these organisms is not clear . In yeast , the vacuole seems to have the function of an iron - storage compartment [ 71 ] . However , in the case of T . foetus , the majority of iron incorporated from the iron – nitrilotriacetate complex remains in the cytosol [ 72 ] . The lack of a major iron - binding protein within these organ - isms reveals another question : what form does iron take between its uptake and incorporation into target proteins or distribution between different compartments ? It is important to complete our knowledge of the mech - anisms of iron metabolism in unicellular eukaryotic patho - gens because this might lead to the development of novel chemotherapeutic strategies . Without effective mechan - isms for acquisition and utilization of iron , no organism can survive , especially parasites that have intense iron requirements .

As part of this enterprise , Elsevier has given hundreds of journals to Access to Global Online Research in Agriculture ( AGORA ) . More than 100 institutions are now registered for the scheme , which aims to provide developing countries with free access to vital research that will ultimately help increase crop yields and encourage agricultural self - sufficiency . According to the Africa University in Zimbabwe , AGORA has been welcomed by both students and staff . ‘‘It has brought a wealth of information to our fingertips’’ , says Vimbai Hungwe . ‘‘The information made available goes a long way in helping the learning , teaching and research activities within the University . Given the economic hardships we are going through , it couldn’t have come at a better time . ’’ For more information , visit www . aginternetwork . org Review Trends in Microbiology Vol . 16 No . 6 268
