Flagellar assembly begins with the basal body , followed by the hook and finally the filament . A carboxyl - terminal cytoplasmic domain of FlhA ( FlhA C ) forms a nonameric ring structure in the flagellar type III protein export apparatus and coordinates flagellar protein export with assembly . However , the mechanism of this process remains unknown . We report that a flexible linker of FlhA C ( FlhA L ) is re - quired not only for FlhA C ring formation but also for substrate specificity switching of the protein export apparatus from the hook protein to the filament protein upon completion of the hook structure . FlhA L was required for coop - erative ring formation of FlhA C . Alaninesubstitutions ofresiduesinvolvedinFlhA C ring formation interfered with the substrate specificity switching , thereby inhibiting filament assembly at the hook tip . These observations lead us to propose a mechanistic model for export switching involving structural remodeling of FlhA C . INTRODUCTION Biological supramolecular machines assemble in a highly organized and well - controlled manner . One example is the bacterial flagellum , which consist ofabout 30 different proteins withcopy numbers ranging from a few to about 30 , 000 . The flagellum includes at least three parts : the basal body as a rotary motor , the hook as a universal joint , and the fila - ment as a helical propeller . Flagellar assembly begins with the basal body , followed by the hook and finally the filament . There are more than 70 genes in the flagellar regulon of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( hereafter referred to Salmonella ) . Flagellar gene tran - scription iscoupled to theassemblyprocess atthelevel of completionof hook - basal body ( HBB ) assembly . During HBB assembly , FlgM , which acts as an anti - s factor , binds to the flagellum - specific sigma factor s 28 to prevent transcription of flagellin gene ( fliC ) , stator genes ( motA and motB ) , chemoreceptor genes ( tar , tsr , etc . ) , and chemotaxis genes ( che ) that are only required after HBB completion . Upon completion of HBB assembly , a type III protein export apparatus transports FlgM into the culture media , allowing s 28 to transcribe these flagellar genes . An export switching machinery allows the protein export apparatus to couple fla - gellar gene expression with assembly ( 1 ) . The flagellar export switching machinery consists of at least two flagellar proteins , FliK and FlhB , which act as a molecular ruler and an export switch , respectively , and switches substrate specificity of the fla - gellar type III protein export apparatus from proteins needed for the structure and assembly of the hook ( FlgD , FlgE , and FliK ) ( hook - type class ) to those for the filament assembly ( FlgK , FlgL , FlgM , FliC , and FliD ) ( filament - type class ) upon completion of the hook structure to be about 55 nm long in Salmonella ( 2 ) . Genetic analysis and photo - crosslinking experiments have revealed that an interaction between the C - terminal domain of FliK and the C - terminal cytoplasmic do - main of FlhB catalyzes the substrate specificity switch ( 3 ) . The flagellar type III protein export apparatus is composed of a transmembrane export gate complex made of FlhA , FlhB , FliP , FliQ , and FliR and a cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphatase ( ATPase ) ring complex consisting of FliH , FliI , and FliJ ( 4 , 5 ) . The protein export apparatus uses adenosine 5 ′ - triphosphate and proton motive force ( PMF ) across the cytoplasmicmembraneastheenergysourcesandactsasaproton / protein antiporter to couple the proton influx through the gate complex with fla - gellar protein export ( 6 , 7 ) . FlhA acts as an energy transducer along with the cytoplasmic ATPase ring complex ( 6 , 8 , 9 ) . FlhA forms a homo - nonamerthroughinteractionsbetweenitsC - terminalcytoplasmicdomains ( FlhA C ) ( 10 – 12 ) . The FlhA C nonamer acts as the docking platform for FliH , FliI , FliJ , flagellar type III export chaperones , FlgN , FliS , FliT , and exportsubstrates ( 2 ) . FlhA C consistsofdomainsD1 ( residues362to434 and residues 484 to 503 ) , D2 ( residues 435 to 483 ) , D3 ( residues 504 to 583 ) , and D4 ( residues 584 to 682 ) and a flexible linker termed FlhA L ( residues 328 to 361 ) ( 13 ) . Filament - type export substrates in complex with their cognate chaperones bind to a highly conserved hydrophobic dimple located at an interface between domans D1 and D2 of FlhA C to promote unfolding and protein translocation by the protein export ap - paratus ( 14 – 18 ) . DifferentbindingaffinitiesofFlhA C forthechaperone - substrate complexes are postulated to ensure the well - defined order of protein export among the filament - type proteins ( 16 ) . Mutational analysis has shown that a highly conserved cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane helices 4 and 5 , which is named the FHIPEP ( flagellum / hypersensitive response / invasion protein export pore ) domain , coordinates the export of hook - type substrates — FlgD , FlgE , and FliK — with hook assembly ( 19 ) . This suggests that the FHIPEP domain may be part of the entrance gate that regulates well - ordered substrate entry into the pore of the export gate complex . A protonation - mimicking FlhA ( D158N ) mutation in this FHIPEP domain induces a large conformational change of FlhA C ( 9 ) . The FHIPEP domain directly binds to FlhA C ( 20 ) . Because the distance between the cytoplasmic membrane and the FlhA C ring is about 6 nm ( 10 , 11 ) , it has been proposed that the FlhA C ring can get close to the FHIPEP domain through a proton - driven conformational change of FlhA L during protein transport ( 9 ) . Truncations of domain D4 in FlhA C allow the protein 1 Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences , Osaka University , 1 - 3 Yamadaoka , Suita , Osaka 565 - 0871 , Japan . 2 Bio - AFM Frontier Research Center , Kanazawa University , Kanazawa 920 - 1192 , Japan . 3 RIKEN Quantitative Biology Center , 1 - 3 Yamadaoka , Suita , Osaka 565 - 0871 , Japan . 4 Department of Bioscience and Bioinformatics , Fac - ulty of Computer Science and Systems Engineering , Kyushu Institute of Technol - ogy , 680 - 4 Kawazu , Iizuka , Fukuoka 820 - 8502 , Japan . 5 Department of Physics , Kanazawa University , Kanazawa 920 - 1192 , Japan . 6 Department of Physics , Nagoya University , Chikusa - ku , Nagoya 464 - 8602 , Japan . 7 Department of Macromolecular Science , Graduate School of Science , Osaka University , 1 - 1 Machikaneyama - cho , Toyonaka , Osaka 560 - 0043 , Japan . 8 Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology , Japan Science and Technology Agency , Goban - cho , Chiyoda - ku , Tokyo 102 - 0076 , Japan . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † Corresponding author .

Adv . 2018 ; 4 : eaao7054 25 April 2018 1 of 9 export apparatus to transport FlgM into the periplasm during HBB assembly ( 21 ) , raising the possibility that the D4 domain may suppress the interactions of FlhA C with filament - type substrates in complex with their cognate chaperones before HBB completion . However , it remains unknown how the FlhA C ring undergoes conformational re - arrangements to coordinate flagellar protein export with assembly . To clarify this process , we applied high - speed atomic force microscopy ( HS - AFM ) combined with structure - based functional analyses and provided evidence suggesting that interactions of FlhA L with the D1 and D2 domains of its neighboring FlhA C subunit are responsible not only for highly cooperative FlhA C ring formation but also for the sub - strate specificity switch . RESULTS HS - AFM imaging of the FlhA C ring structure FlhA C stably exists as a monomer in solution even at high protein concentrations ( 22 ) although it is directly involved in FlhA ring forma - tion in vivo ( 10 , 12 ) . To clarify how FlhA C facilitates ring formation , we purified FlhA C monomers by size - exclusion chromatography ( fig . S1A ) and observed structural dynamics of FlhA C at a single molecular level by HS - AFM , which is able to visualize protein complexes in action at a high spatiotemporal resolution ( 23 – 25 ) . The molecular shape of the FlhA C monomer in the experimental AFM image was almost the same as that of a simulated image constructed from the crystal structure of Salmonella FlhA C ( fig . S1B ) ( 13 ) . FlhA C monomers associated with and dissociated from each other and finally formed a stable ring - shaped structure ( Fig . 1A and movie S1 ) . The shape of the FlhA C ring in the experimental AFM image was almost the same as that of a simulated image constructed from the nonameric ring model of Salmonella FlhA C ( Fig . 1B and movie S2 ) ( 11 ) . About 80 % of FlhA C rings contained nine copiesofFlhA C subunits ( n = 100 ) ( Fig . 1C ) , inagreementwithprevious reports ( 10 – 12 ) . The diameter ( peak - to - peak distance ) and the height of the FlhA C ring were estimated to be 10 . 1 ± 0 . 6 nm and 5 . 1 ± 0 . 4 nm , respectively ( Fig . 1 , D and E ) , which are almost the same as those of the three - dimensional density map of the in situ FlhA C ring structure ( 10 , 11 ) . Therefore , weconcludethatthisAFMimageoftheFlhA C ring reflects the in vivo structure . The number of the FlhA C ring was considerably in - creased with an increase in protein concentration ( Fig . 1F and fig . S2A ) . The dissociation constant and the Hill ’ s cooperativity coefficient were es - timated to be about 0 . 72 ± 0 . 02 m M and 5 . 5 ± 0 . 8 , respectively . These sug - gest that FlhA C forms a homononamer in a highly cooperative manner . Effect of a deletion of FlhA L on FlhA C ring formation Two FlhA C molecules are present in an asymmetric unit of the Salmonella FlhA C crystal ( Fig . 2A ) , and the molecules form a tubular structure with a left - handed 8 1 screw symmetry along the c axis in the crystal ( 13 ) . FlhA L consists of residues 328 to 361 ( 13 , 22 ) . In the crystal structure , the N - terminal 19 residues of FlhA L ( 328 to 346 , FlhA L - N ) are invisible and the following 15 residues ( 347 to 361 , FlhA L - C ) bind to the D1 and D3 domains of its neighboring subunit along the 1 - start helix ( Fig . 2A ) ( 13 ) . This raises the possibility that FlhA L - C contributes to highly cooperative FlhA C ring formation . To test this hypothesis , we first purified FlhA C monomers lacking residues 328 to 351 of FlhA ( FlhA C 38K ) ( 22 ) and used HS - AFM to analyze the capability of these monomers for ring formation . FlhA C 38K monomers interacted with and dissociated from each other in a way similar to wild - type FlhA C but did not form the ring - like structure ( Fig . 2B and movie S3 ) , indi - cating that residues 328 to 351 of FlhA L are required for stable ring formation on mica surface . Because FlhA C can get close to the cyto - plasmic surface of the cytoplasmic membrane when it interacts with the FHIPEP domain of FlhA ( 9 , 20 ) , we next investigated whether phos - pholipids affect FlhA C ring formation . We spread planar phospho - lipid bilayers on mica surface , placed a solution sample of wild - type FlhA C monomers or FlhA C 38K monomers with various concentra - tions , and analyzed their ring formation . Wild - type FlhA C also formed the nonameric ring structure on mica - supported planar phospho - lipid bilayers in a protein concentration – dependent manner ( Fig . 2B , fig . S2B , and movie S4 ) . The dissociation constant and the Hill ’ s coop - erativity coefficient were estimated to be about 2 . 3 ± 0 . 01 m M and 7 . 4 ± 0 . 2 , respectively ( Fig . 2C ) , indicating that phospholipids enhance positively cooperative ring formation but reduce the binding affin - ity for its nearest neighboring subunit . Phospholipids stabilized in - teractions between FlhA C 38K monomers to a considerable degree , facilitating the formation of the ring - shaped structure on the mica - supported planar phospholipid bilayers ( Fig . 2B , fig . S2C , and movie S5 ) . The dissociation constant and the Hill ’ s cooperativity coefficient were estimated to be about 10 . 3 ± 0 . 8 m M and 2 . 2 ± 0 . 4 , respectively ( Fig . 2C ) , indicating that residues 328 to 351 of FlhA L are required for highly cooperative ring formation of FlhA C . Because the D1 - D3 and D3 - D3 interactions mainly contribute to FlhA C ring formation ( 10 ) , we conclude that FlhA L stabilizes these two interactions through in - teractions of FlhA L - C with the D1 and D3 domains of its neighboring FlhA C subunit . Effects of alanine substitutions of residues involved in interactions of FlhA L with its neighboring subunit on flagellar assembly Two negatively charged residues , Glu 351 and Asp 356 , in FlhA L - C bind to a positively charged cluster formed by Arg 388 , Arg 391 , Lys 392 , and Lys 393 in domain D1 of its neighboring subunit in the crystal . Trp 354 in FlhA L - C binds to a hydrophobic pocket formed by Val 357 of FlhA L - C and Phe 400 and Leu 401 in domain D1 , Leu 512 in domain D3 , and the side chain arms of Glu 508 , Gln 511 , and Arg 515 in domain D3 of its neighboring subunit ( Fig . 2A ) . Glu 351 ismissinginFlhA C 38K , raisingthepossibilitythatthese residues are responsible for highly cooperative FlhA C ring formation on mica . To clarify the role of these residues , we introduced the W354A , E351A / D356A , E351A / W354A / D356A , R391A / K392A / K393A , L401A , and Q511A mutations into FlhA by site - directed mutagenesis . Immunoblotting with polyclonal anti - FlhA C antibody revealed that these mutations did not affect the protein stability of FlhA ( fig . S3A ) . To test whether these mutations affect FlhA function , we analyzed the effect of these substitutions on motility in soft agar ( fig . S3B ) . FlhA ( Q511A ) fully restored motility ofthe D flhA mutant . In agreementwiththis , theQ511A mutation affected neither flagellar protein export nor assembly at all ( Fig . 3A , lane 16 , and fig . S3C ) , indicating that Gln 511 is not essential for the FlhA function . FlhA ( L401A ) restored the motility to a considerable degree although not to the wild - type level . The W354A and E351A / D356A mutants complemented the D flhA mutant to some degree , and the E351A / W354A / D356A and R391A / K392A / K393A mutants did not at all ( fig . S3B ) . Consistently , the W354A and E351A / D356A mutants produced only a few flagellar filaments , of which length was much shorter than the wild - type length , and the E351A / W354A / D356A and R391A / K392A / K393A mutants produced no flagellar fila - ments ( fig . S3C ) . These results indicate that Trp 354 , Glu 351 , Asp 356 , Arg 391 , Lys 392 , and Lys 393 are involved in flagellar formation . To test how these FlhA mutations affect flagellar assembly , we ana - lyzed the secretion levels of hook - type proteins ( FlgD and FlgE ) and S C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E Terahara et al . , Sci . Adv . 2018 ; 4 : eaao7054 25 April 2018 2 of 9 filament - type proteins ( FlgM , FlgK , FlgL , and FliC ) . The W354A , E351A / D356A , and R391A / K392A / K393A mutants secreted both FlgD and FlgE almost at the wild - type levels ( Fig . 3A , lanes 11 , 12 , and 14 ) and so produced HBBs ( Fig . 3B ) . These results indicate that the W354A , E351A / D356A , and R391A / K392A / K393A mutations do not inhibit HBB assembly . Their hook length distributions were quite broad compared to the wild - type ( fig . S3D ) . The R391A / K392A / K393A mutant produced much longer hooks called polyhooks ( Fig . 3B ) . These observations suggest that these mutations affect the hook length con - trol significantly . In contrast , the W354A , E351A / D356A , and R391A / K392A / K393A mutations inhibited the secretion of FlgM , FlgK , FlgL , and FliC ( Fig . 3A , lanes 11 , 12 , and 14 ) . In addition , the cellular ex - pression levels of FliC were much lower in these flhA mutants than the wild - type level ( Fig . 3A , sixth row , lanes 3 , 4 , and 6 ) . FlgM acts as an anti - s factor to inhibit the transcription of fliC during HBB as - sembly . Upon hook completion , the flagellar type III protein export apparatus secretes FlgM into the culture media , allowing FliC to be expressed , exported , and assembled into the filament at the tip of the hook - filament junction made of FlgK and FlgL with the help of the FliD cap ( 26 ) . Therefore , we suggest that the W354A , E351A / D356A , and R391A / K392A / K393A mutations interfere with substrate specific - ity switching of the flagellar export apparatus from the hook - type to the filament - type . Neither hook - type nor filament - type substrates were secreted by the E351A / W354A / D356A mutant ( Fig . 3A , lane 13 ) , and so , only the MS - C rings were produced ( Fig . 3B ) . This indicates that the E351A / W354A / D356A triple mutation abolishes the PMF - driven fla - gellar protein export process . The flhA ( L401A ) mutant cells secreted FlgD and FlgE into the cul - ture media at wild - type levels ( Fig . 3A , lane 15 ) and produced hooks withnormallength distribution ( Fig . 3B ) . In contrast , thelevelsofFlgM , Fig . 1 . FlhA C forms a ring - shaped structure . ( A ) Typical HS - AFM image of FlhA C placed on mica at a protein concentration of 2 . 4 m M .

Adv . 2018 ; 4 : eaao7054 25 April 2018 3 of 9 FlgK , FlgL , and FliC secreted by the L401A mutant were only 50 % of wild - type levels ( Fig . 3A , lane 15 ) . Because the flhA ( L401A ) mutant formed filaments at wild - type levels when grown overnight at 30°C ( fig . S3C ) , this suggests that the FlhA ( L401A ) mutation reduces the rate of filament polymerization . Because the W354A , E351A / D356A , and R391A / K392A / K393A mutants produced longer hooks without the fila - ment attached , we propose that Glu 351 , Trp 354 , and Asp 356 in FlhA L - C andArg 391 , Lys 392 , andLys 393 indomainD1areresponsible for the sub - strate specificity switching of the flagellar export apparatus upon completion of HBB assembly . Effects of alanine substitutions of residues involved in interactions of FlhA L with its neighboring subunit on FlhA C ring formation To investigate whether Glu 351 , Trp 354 , Asp 356 , Arg 391 , Lys 392 , and Lys 393 are also responsible for FlhA C ring formation , we analyzed the effect of alanine substitutions of these residues on FlhA C ring forma - tion by HS - AFM . The W354A , E351A / D356A , E351A / W354A / D356A , and R391A / K392A / K393A mutations inhibited FlhA C ring forma - tion on mica even at high protein concentrations , although inter - mediate ring structures were observed frequently ( Fig . 2D ) . Unlike FlhA C 38K lacking residues 328 to 351 , planar phospholipid bilayers did not improve their capability of ring formation even at high protein concentrations ( fig . S4 ) . These results indicate that these mutations significantly affect the D1 - FlhA L - C and D3 - FlhA L - C interactions . Be - cause FlhA C 38K retains the ability to form the nonameric ring struc - ture to a considerable degree in the presence of phospholipids ( Fig . 2B ) , this raises the possibility that FlhA L - N regulates highly cooperative FlhA C ring formation . The FlhA ( L401A ) mutant variant retained the ability to form the nonameric ring structure to some degree only when a protein concentration was high enough ( Fig . 2D and fig . S4 ) . There - fore , we suggest that the interactions of FlhA L - C with the D1 and D3 domains of its neighboring subunit are responsible for FlhA C ring for - mation in a highly cooperative manner .

S C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E Terahara et al . , Sci . Adv . 2018 ; 4 : eaao7054 25 April 2018 4 of 9 Effects of FlhA mutations on interactions of FlhA C with FlgN and FliJ The FlgN - FlgK , FlgN - FlgL , FliT - FliD , and FliS - FliC chaperone - substrate complexes directly bind to FlhA C through interactions of FlgN , FliT , and FliS with a highly conserved hydrophobic dimple at an interface between domains D1 and D2 of FlhA C ( 14 – 18 ) . We found that the W354A , E351A / D356A , R391A / K392A / K393A , and L401A mutations significantly reduced theexportof FlgK , FlgL , and FliC , raising the question of whether these mutations affect the interactions of FlhA C with the chaperone - substrate complexes . To clarify this possibility , we carried out pull - down assays by glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) affinity chromatography . FlhA C copurifiedwithGST - FlgNincomplexwithFlgK and GST - FlgN alone but not with GST alone ( Fig . 3C and fig . S5A ) , in agreement with previous reports ( 15 , 16 ) . In contrast , the W354A , E351A / D356A , R391A / K392A / K393A , and L401A mutant variants did not copurify with the GST - FlgN – FlgK complex and GST - FlgN ( Fig . 3C and fig . S5A ) . Because these mutations inhibit FlhA C ring formation even in the presence of phospholipids , this suggests that the interaction site for the FlgN - FlgK complex may lie across more than one subunit in the FlhA C ring structure . Because Tyr 122 of FlgN , which is highly conserved among FlgN homologs , interacts with Asp 456 , Phe 459 , and Thr 490 in the conserved hydrophobic dimple of FlhA C ( 15 ) , it is also possible that these mutations could affect a conformation of this conserved hydro - phobic dimple , thereby reducing the binding affinities of FlhA C for FlgN significantly . FlhA L is directly involved in the interaction with FliJ ( 6 , 14 ) . There - fore , we tested whether the FlhA mutations also reduce the binding affinity of FlhA for FliJ . Wild - type FlhA copurified with GST - FliJ but not with GST alone ( Fig . 4A and fig . S5B ) , in agreement with a previous report ( 6 ) . Except for the Q511A mutant , which displayed no pheno - type ( fig . S3 ) , the other mutations significantly reduced the binding affinity of FlhA for FliJ ( Fig . 4A ) . Consistently , the W354A , E351A / D356A , E351A / W354A / D356A , R391A / K392A / K393A , and L401A mutations inhibited the interaction between FlhA C and FliJ ( fig . S5C ) . These results suggest that Glu 351 , Trp 354 , Asp 356 , Arg 391 , Lys 392 , Lys 393 , and Leu 401 are required for the interaction with FliJ . It has been shown that an interaction between FliJ and FlhA L is critical for PMF - driven flagellar protein export and that FliH and FliI ensure the FliJ - FlhA L interaction to allow the export gate complex to efficiently transport flagellar proteins in a PMF - dependent manner ( 6 , 27 ) . Unlike a Salmonella flhA mutant lacking residues 328 to 351 of FlhA L that cannot transport any flagellar proteins ( 22 ) , we found that the W354A , E351A / D356A , R391A / K392A / K393A , and L401A mu - tants produced HBBs at the wild - type level , raising the possibility that FliH and FliI also support the FliJ - FlhA L interaction to induce conformational rearrangements of FlhA C responsible for the substrate specificity switch . We found that the FlhA ( L401A ) mutation reduced not only the rates of filament - type protein export but also the binding affinity of FlhA C for FliJ , whereas the FlhA ( Q511A ) mutation did not at all ( Figs . 3 and 4A ) . This raises the possibility that FlhA ( L401A ) prob - ably requires the support of FliH and FliI to exert its export activity to a considerable degree , whereas FlhA ( Q511A ) does not . To test this hy - pothesis , we used a D fliH - fliI flhB ( P28T ) ( D fliH - fliI flhB * ) mutant , of which second - site P28T mutation in FlhB considerably increases the probability of flagellar protein export and assembly in the absence of FliH and FliI ( 28 ) . FlhA ( Q511A ) restored motility of the Salmonella D fliH - fliI flhB * D flhA mutant to the wild - type level , whereas FlhA ( L401A ) did not ( Fig . 4B , upper panel ) . The D fliH - fliI flhB * flhA ( Q511A ) mutant secreted both FlgD and FlgK at the wild - type levels Fig . 3 .

Purified His - FlhA C ( WT ) or His - FlhA C ( W354A ) ( W354A ) was mixed with GST - FlgN in complex with FlgK ( first and second rows ) , or GST alone ( third row ) and dialyzed overnight against phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and dialyzed over - night against PBS . The mixture ( L ) was subjected to GST affinity chromatography . Flow through fraction ( F .

In contrast , the D fliH - fliIflhB * flhA ( L401A ) mu - tant secreted a much higher amount of FlgD into the culture media comparedtothewild - typelevelbutnotFlgKatall ( Fig . 4B , lowerpanel ) . Consistently , the D fliH - fliI flhB * flhA ( L401A ) cells produced HBBs ( fig . S6A ) . We obtained essentially the same results with the D fliH flhA ( L401A ) and D fliH - fliI flhA ( L401A ) mutants ( fig . S6B ) . When FliH and FliI were expressed in the D fliH - fliI flhB * flhA ( L401A ) cells , motility was restored considerably ( Fig . 4B , upper panel ) . In agreement with this , FlgK was secreted into the culture media ( Fig . 4B , lower panel ) . These results indicate that FlhA ( L401A ) requires FliH and FliI to exert its ex - port activity . Therefore , we propose that an interaction between FliJ and FlhA C , which is ensured by FliH and FliI , may induce structural re - modelingof the FlhA C ringupon completionof HBB assembly , allowing the flagellar type III protein export apparatus to initiate the export of filament - type proteins to form the filament at the hook tip . Effects of the FlhA ( F459A ) mutation on FlhA C ring formation The FlhA ( F459A ) mutation , which is located in a conserved hydro - phobic dimple at an interface between domains D1 and D2 of FlhA C , reduces the binding affinities of FlhA C for the FlgN - FlgK , FlgN - FlgL , FliT - FliD , and FliS - FliC complexes ( 15 , 16 ) . As a result , the secretion levels of FlgK , FlgL , FliD , and FliC are reduced significantly , although the F459A mutation does not affect hook - type protein export at all ( 16 , 29 ) . The flhA ( F459A ) mutant phenotype looks similar to that of the flhA ( L401A ) mutant , raising the possibility that the FlhA ( F459A ) mutation might affect the interaction with FliJ . The flhA ( F459A ) mu - tant produced normal hooks with nearly normal average length and length distribution ( fig . S7A ) , in agreement with a previous report ( 29 ) . Pull - down assays by GST affinity chromatography revealed that the F459A mutation did not weaken the interaction of FlhA C with FliJ ( fig . S7B ) . HS - AFM imaging revealed that FlhA C ( F459A ) formed a nonameric ring structure with 9 . 8 ± 0 . 5 nm in diameter ( peak - to - peak distance ) and 5 . 0 ± 0 . 4 nm in height in a way similar to wild - type FlhA C ( fig . S7 , C to F ) . These results indicate that the F459A mutation affects neither the interaction of FlhA C with FliJ nor FlhA C ring formation . Therefore , we conclude that Phe 459 is directly in - volved in the interaction with the flagellar export chaperone - substrate complexes . DISCUSSION The flagellar type III protein export apparatus switches its substrate specificity from the hook - type to the filament - type . FliK and FlhB are responsible for this switching event ( 1 , 2 ) . FlhA forms a homo - nonamer through interactions between FlhA C domains at the flagellar base ( 10 – 12 ) . FlhA C , which consists of domains D1 , D2 , D3 , and D4 and FlhA L ( 13 ) , coordinates flagellar protein export with assembly ( 16 , 21 ) . However , little is known about FlhA C action . The crystal struc - ture of the C - terminal cytoplasmic domain of MxiA ( MxiA C ) , which is an FlhA homolog of the Shigella virulence - associated type III secretion apparatus , forms a nonameric ring through D1 - D3 and D3 - D3 interac - tions ( 10 ) . Although Salmonella FlhA C does not form such a ring struc - ture in the crystal , very similar interactions between FlhA C molecules are observed ( Fig . 2A ) ( 13 ) . Here , real - time imaging by HS - AFM re - vealed that Salmonella FlhA C forms a nonameric ring structure on mica surface in a highly cooperative manner and that FlhA L is required for efficient FlhA C ring formation ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Alanine substitutions of Glu 351 , Trp 354 , and Asp 356 in FlhA L - C and Arg 391 , Lys 392 , and Lys 393 in domain D1 , which are involved in the interaction of FlhA L with its neighboring FlhA C subunit in the FlhA C crystal ( Fig . 2A ) ( 13 ) , not only inhibited cooperativeFlhA C ringformationonbothmica and phospho - lipids ( Fig . 2D ) but also reduced the probability of filament assembly upon completion of HBB assembly ( Fig . 3A and fig . S3 ) . These muta - tions also reduced the binding affinity of FlhA C for the FlgN chaperone , thereby reducing the export of FlgK and FlgL considerably ( Fig . 3 and fig . S5A ) . This raises the possibility that the interaction site for the FlgN - FlgKcomplex lies across more than one subunit in the FlhA C ringstruc - ture . Because the W354A , E351A / D356A , and R391A / K392A / K393A mutants produced the HBBs at the wild - type level ( Fig . 3B ) , we suggest that the interactions of FlhA L with its neighboring subunit in the ring structure initiate the export of filament - type proteins upon HBB com - pletion ( Fig . 5 ) . A highly conserved hydrophobic dimple at an interface betweendomainsD1andD2ofFlhA C providesabindingsiteforflagellar exportchaperone - substratecomplexes ( 14 – 16 ) . A well - conservedPhe 459 residue in the hydrophobic dimple is directly involved in the interaction Fig . 4 . EffectofdepletionsofFliHandFliIontheexportfunctionofFlhA ( L401A ) .

The mixture of the soluble fractions ( Input ) prepared from Salmonella D flhDC - cheW cells expressing GST - FliJ with those from a Salmonella D flhA mutant carrying pTrc99AFF4 ( indicated as D flhA ) , pMM130 ( WT ) , pYI001 ( W354A ) , pYI002 ( E351A / D356A ) , pYI003 ( E351A / W354A / D356A ) , pYI004 ( R391A / K392A / K393A ) , pYI005 ( L401A ) , or pYI006 ( Q511A ) was loaded onto a GST column .

Adv . 2018 ; 4 : eaao7054 25 April 2018 6 of 9 with the chaperone - substrate complexes ( 15 , 16 ) but not in FlhA C ring formation ( fig . S7 ) . Therefore , we propose that the interactions of FlhA L with its neighboring subunit may induce conformational arrangements of theFlhA C ring ina highlycooperative manner , allowing filament - type substrates in complex with their cognate chaperones to be bound to the FlhA C ring for their efficient export ( Fig . 5 ) . FliJ binds to FlhA L , allowing the export gate complex to drive fla - gellar protein export in a PMF - dependent manner ( 6 , 30 ) . FliH and FliI are required for efficient FliJ - FlhA L interaction ( 6 , 27 ) . Here , the FlhA ( L401A ) mutations reduced not only the probability of FlhA C ring formation ( Fig . 2D ) but also the rate of filament - type protein ex - port ( Fig . 3A ) . The L401A mutation also decreased the binding affinity of FlhA C for FliJ ( Fig . 4A and fig . S5C ) , suggesting that Leu 401 is in - volved in the interaction with FliJ . The L401A mutation totally inhibited the export of FlgK in the absence of FliH and FliI but not in their pres - ence ( Fig . 4B ) . The L401A mutation did not abolish the export of FlgD even in the absence of FliH and FliI ( Fig . 4B ) . In agreement with this , the D fliH - fliI flhB * flhA ( L401A ) cells produced the HBBs ( fig . S6A ) . These results suggest that the flagellar type III export gate complex containing FlhA ( L401A ) requires FliH and FliI to transport filament - type proteins upon completion of the hook structure . Therefore , we propose that FliH and FliI may support efficient interaction between FliJ and FlhA L to induce structural remodeling of the FlhA C ring structure through cooperative interactions between FlhA L - C of each subunit and FlhA C of its neighboring subunit for the substrate spec - ificity switching of the flagellar protein export apparatus . MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains , plasmids , DNA manipulations , and media Salmonella strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in table S1 . DNA manipulations , site - directed mutagenesis , and DNA sequencing were carried out as described previously ( 31 ) . L - broth and soft agar plates were prepared as described previously ( 4 , 5 ) . Ampicillin was added to the media at a final concentration of 100 m g / ml . Purification of His - FlhA C and its mutant variants His - FlhA C and its mutant variants were purified by Ni - NTA ( nitrilo - triacetic acid ) affinity chromatography from the soluble fractions of Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) ( Novagen ) cells carrying a pET15b - based plasmid , followed by size - exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 75 column ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated with 50 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , and 1 mM dithiothreitol , as described previously ( 22 ) . Fig . 5 . Model for cooperative remodeling of the FlhA C ring structure . Partial atomic models of the MxiA C ( left ; PDB ID : 4A5P ) and FlhA C ( right ; PDB ID : 3A5I ) ring models are shown . Both MxiA C and FlhA C consist of domains D1 ( cyan ) , D2 ( blue ) , D3 ( light green ) , and D4 ( red ) . FlhA C forms a nonameric ring structure mainly through interactions between D3 domains and between domains D1 and D3 . Only an N - terminal short stretch forming part ( magenta ) of a flexible linker is visible , whereas most of residues forming the linker are invisible because of their conformational flexibility . In contrast , about a C - terminal half of FlhA L binds to its neighboring subunit in the FlhA C crystal . During hook assembly , FlhA L does not bind to its neighboring subunit , allowing the flagellar type III protein export apparatus to transport the hook protein . Upon completion of the hook structure , FlhA L binds to the D1 and D3 domains of its neighboring subunit , inducing conformational changes of the FlhA C ring in a highly cooperative manner . As a result , the protein export apparatus terminates the export of the hook protein and initiates the export of filament - type proteins responsible for filament formation at the hook tip .

Adv . 2018 ; 4 : eaao7054 25 April 2018 7 of 9 HS - AFM imaging and image analysis HS - AFM imaging was performed in solution using a laboratory - built HS - AFM setup ( 32 , 33 ) , as described previously ( 34 ) . In brief , a glass sample stage ( diameter , 2 mm ; height , 2 mm ) with a thin mica disc ( 1 mm in diameter and ~ 0 . 05 mm thick ) glued to the top by epoxy was attached onto the top of a Z - scanner by a drop of nail polish . A freshly cleaved mica surface was prepared by removing the top layers of mica using a Scotch tape . Then , 2 m l of protein solution with various concentrations in a dilution buffer [ 50 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 100 mM NaCl ] was deposited onto the mica surface . After incubation at room temperature for 3 min , the mica surface was rinsed with 20 m l of an observation buffer [ 10 mM tris - HCl ( pH 6 . 8 ) ] to remove floating sam - ples . The sample stage was then immersed in a liquid cell containing about 60 m l of the observation buffer . AFM imaging was carried out in a tapping mode , using small cantilevers ( BLAC10DS - A2 , Olympus ) ( res - onant frequency , ~ 0 . 5 MHz in water ; quality factor , ~ 2 in water ; spring constant , ~ 0 . 1 N / m ) . The cantilever ’ s free oscillation amplitude A 0 and set - point amplitude A s were set at 1 to 2 nm and ~ 0 . 9 × A 0 , respectively . ForAFMimageanalysis , HS - AFMimages werepretreated bya low - passfiltertoremovespikenoiseandaflattenfilter tomaketheoverall xy plane flat , using a laboratory - built software as described before ( 35 ) . More than 100 individual molecules per frame in each condition were analyzed . The accuracy of our HS - AFM measurements is es - timated to be about 1 nm for distance between two objects and 0 . 15 nm for height ( 36 ) . To simulate HS - AFM images of FlhA C monomers and the FlhA C nonamers , we used the software tool , SPM simulator ( Advanced Algorithm Systems ) , as described previously ( 24 ) . Preparation of mica - supported planar lipid bilayers Mica - supported planar phospholipid bilayers were prepared as described previously ( 34 ) . Phospholipids used in this study were composed of DPTAP ( 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - 3 - trimethylammonium - propane ) , NTA - DPGS ( 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - [ ( N - ( 5 - amino - 1 - carboxypentyl ) iminodiacetic acid ) succinyl ] ) , biotin - cap - DPPE [ 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( cap biotinyl ) ] , and DPPC ( 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ) ( Avanti Polar Lipids Inc . ) in a 2 . 5 to 1 to 1 to 95 . 5 weight ratio . Chloroform in the lipid mixture was dried up under a stream of N 2 gas and was completely evaporated by a vacuum desiccator . Milli - Q water was added to the dried phospholipid mixture , and the suspension was so - nicated to prepare the multilamellar vesicles . The phospholipid mix - ture was diluted in a 10 mM MgCl 2 solution and was sonicated to prepare small unilamellar vesicles . The membrane vesicles were put onto freshly cleaved mica and were incubated for 10 min at room tem - perature to spread phospholipid bilayers on the mica surface . The sur - plus vesicles were removed by rinsing with Milli - Q water . A drop of 5 mM NiCl 2 solution was deposited onto the phospholipid bilayers , and the stage was incubated for 30 s at room temperature . After washing with an imaging solution , a drop of sample solution was deposited , and then HS - AFM imaging was carried out . Motility assay in soft agar Fresh colonies were inoculated onto soft agar plates and incubated at 30°C . Immunostaining of flagellar filaments Salmonella cells were attached to a coverslip ( Matsunami glass ) , and unattached cells were washed away with motility medium [ 10 mM potassium phosphate ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , and 10 mM sodium lactate ] . Flagellar filaments were labeled with a fluorescent dye , Alexa Fluor 594 ( Invitrogen ) , and were observed by fluorescence microscopy as described previously ( 37 ) . Secretion assay Details of sample preparations have been described previously ( 38 ) . After SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , immunoblotting with polyclonal anti - FlgD , anti - FlgE , anti - FlgK , anti - FlgL , anti - FlgM , or anti - FliC antibody was carried out as described previously ( 4 ) . De - tection was performed with an ECL prime immunoblotting detec - tion kit ( GE Healthcare ) . Chemiluminescence signals were captured by a Luminoimage analyzer LAS - 3000 ( GE Healthcare ) . More than three independent experiments were carried out . Preparation of HBB and measurements of the hook length HBBs were prepared as described previously ( 39 ) . After sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation , samples containing HBBs and intact flagella were collected from a 20 to 50 % sucrose density gradient in 10 mM tris - HCl ( pH8 . 0 ) , 5 mM EDTA , and 1 % Triton X - 100 . After ultracentrifugation of fractions containing the HBBs at 60 , 000 g for 60 min , the pellets were resuspended in 50 m l of a TET ( Tris EDTA Tri - ton ) buffer [ 10mMtris - HCl ( pH8 . 0 ) , 5mMEDTA , 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 ] . When intact flagella were prepared from the sucrose density gradient , followed by ultracentrifugation at 60 , 000 g for 60 min , the pellets were suspended in 50 mM glycine ( pH 2 . 5 ) and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and were incubated atroom temperature for 30 minto depolymerize theflagellar filaments . After ultracentrifugation , the pellets were resuspended in 50 m l of the TET buffer . Samples were negatively stained with 2 % uranyl acetate . Electron micrographs were recorded with a JEM - 1011 trans - mission electron microscope ( JEOL ) operated at 100 kV and equipped with an F415 charge - coupled device camera ( TVIPS ) at a magnification of ×5500 , which corresponds to 2 . 75 nm per pixel . Hook length was measured by ImageJ version 1 . 48 ( National Institutes of Health ) . Pull - down assays by GST chromatography Detail protocols for pull - down assays by GST affinity chromatography have been described previously ( 6 , 16 ) . At least three independent experiments were carried out .
