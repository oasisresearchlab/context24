Analogical thinking involves drawing connections between seemingly disparate domains to gen - erate new ideas and approaches by identifying structural similarities [ 11 , 13 , 24 , 25 ] . Far analogies , in particular , have been instrumental in some of the most significant scientific and technological break - throughs throughout history [ 6 , 12 , 21 , 35 , 41 ] . However , selecting relevant analogical leads can be challenging due to the preference of memory retrieval for near , within - domain analogies that share object attributes [ 14 , 15 , 19 , 28 ] . Furthermore , analogical processing can be demanding on cognitive resources , often exhausting working memory , especially when multiple rela - tions need to be processed at once [ 18 ] . This can sometimes result in sub - optimal outcomes , as seen in the development of the first microwave oven , which was inspired by the analogy between radar and cooking but took several years to develop into a viable product , due to an improper understanding of users needs [ 10 ] . Existing approaches to analogical processing have attempted to address these challenges through instruction [ 16 , 30 , 37 ] or non - overgeneralized [ 39 ] abstract representations of problems and ana - logical examples [ 27 , 42 ] . Computational models and systems have also been proposed to facilitate this process through various tech - niques of abstraction and representation [ 5 , 9 , 11 , 27 , 33 ] . However , mere exposure to beneficial analogical leads alone is not enough to ensure their adoption in problem - solving [ 23 ] : factors such as expertise [ 2 , 36 ] , presence of usable anchors [ 3 ] , optimal represen - tations [ 7 , 8 , 11 , 17 ] , and diversity of solutions [ 27 ] can affect the premature rejection of potential leads , leading to design fixation [ 1 , 26 , 32 ] . Fully - automated analogical search engines such as SOLVENT [ 5 ] and ProbMap [ 34 ] have proposed breaking down a problem into functional components such as Stakeholders , Purpose and Mecha - nism to facilitate computational retrieval of new analogical leads . Given prior research on the creativity benefits of interacting with ideas in terms of their conceptual " chunks " [ 29 , 43 ] , we hypoth - esize that these conceptual " chunks " may also be beneficial for structuring interactions with existing analogical leads in a way that supports creative exploration and ( re ) interpretation ( and thus less premature rejection ) of analogical leads . In addition , aligning non - identical relational predicates has been suggested to be facilitated by re - representation [ 14 , 31 ] , which can assist in identifying and retrieving relevant analogies in complex systems . Earlier studies conducted in learning environments have explored questions as a possible mechanism to facilitate this process of re - representation and recombination ; attempting to facilitate the creation of new linkages between unlinked or previously linked components tar - geting specific applications [ 20 ] . According to Herring et al . [ 22 ] , designers were found to utilize examples by re - appropriating and recombining solution components to generate novel ideas . Addi - tionally , studies conducted in learning environments have found that questions play a vital role in promoting creative thinking . In particular , open - ended questions were found to greatly increase divergence in thinking [ 40 ] . A recent study [ 38 ] that proposed a system to semi - automatically generate external stimuli in the form of questions found that individuals , who were exposed to these generated questions produced better and more versatile ideas that those who were not . Our approach uses Large Language Models [ 4 ] to make this process easier and more accessible . Building on these insights , we designed a new system that lever - ages chunking and recombination mechanisms to support the recog - nition and adoption of far - domain analogies , facilitating their trans - fer across domains , and mitigating design fixation . By addressing these challenges , our proposed system aims to improve the ef - fectiveness of analogical reasoning in generating breakthrough innovations . 2 THE ANALOGILEAD SYSTEM The AnalogiLead System is designed to foster creative idea genera - tion and problem - solving through its three key sections : Magnets , Playspace , and Recombinations . 2 . 1 Magnets The Magnets in the AnalogiLead System are carefully curated and pre - defined sentence fragments or phrases that represent common functional constraints or attributes related to the problem domain . Expanding upon prior studies , we break down the problem into four components , namely : Stakeholder . This functional constraint highlights the benefi - ciaries who will be affected by the assigned design problem . Context . This functional constraint highlights the context in which the aforementioned stakeholders face the assigned design problem . Goal . This functional constraint highlights the goal that the stakeholders need to achieve to solve the assigned design problem . Obstacle . This functional constraint highlights an obstacle that hinders the stakeholders from achieving their goal for the assigned design problem . Alongside these functional constraints , the recommended analogi - cal leads add an additional constraint to highlight the solution : Solution . This functional constraint highlights the solution pro - posed to solve the goal of the recommended analogical lead for the given design problem . 339 Improving Selection of Analogies with Chunking and Recombination C & C ’23 , June 19 – 21 , 2023 , Virtual Event , USA These Magnets are designed to be flexible and versatile , allow - ing users to select and combine them in various ways to create prompts for idea generation . The Magnets serve as building blocks or " chunks " of ideas that can be easily manipulated and rearranged to construct meaningful questions via . the Playspace . 2 . 2 Playspace The Playspace is where users can experiment with the selected Mag - nets to create questions . The system uses Generative Pretrained Models ( GPT ) to automatically generate a wide range of questions by recombining the selected Magnets in real - time . The generated questions serve as prompts for the user to explore different angles and perspectives on the problem at hand , sparking creative thinking and encouraging divergent ideas . The user can iterate and experi - ment with different combinations of Magnets in the Playspace to generate a multitude of questions that prompt unique insights and solutions , promoting divergent thinking . 2 . 3 Recombinations The Recombinations section of the AnalogiLead System provides users with the option to further customize and refine the generated questions . Users can edit and modify the questions to better align with their thought process , specific problem domain , or desired outcome . This customization capability allows users to fine - tune the prompts to their specific needs , ensuring that the generated questions are relevant , meaningful , and tailored to their unique requirements . The Recombinations section empowers users with creative control , enabling them to craft prompts that are aligned with their creative goals and objectives . The combination of Magnets , Playspace , and Recombinations in the AnalogiLead System creates a dynamic and iterative process for idea generation and problem - solving , ultimately facilitating in selecting the most beneficial analogies for a given problem . The system leverages the power of Generative Pretrained Models to generate a wide range of prompts , while providing users with the flexibility to customize and refine the prompts to suit their creative process . This human - in - the - loop approach fosters exploration of di - verse ideas and encourages unique approaches to problem - solving , making the AnalogiLead System a powerful tool for stimulating creativity and improving selection of analogical inspirations while preventing possibilities for premature rejection and design fixation . 3 TECHNICAL OVERVIEW 3 . 1 Prompt Engineering Prompt : By combining the following list of words to - gether , generate [ n ] meaningful questions with insightfulrelationships : [ word1 , word2 , . . . , wordN ] Output : 1 . TheinterfaceusestheOpenAIlanguagemodel text - davinci - 002 for generating recombinations in a zero - shot learning context . Longer prompts including functional constraints resulted in con - fusing outputs , so the prompt structure was simplified . Descriptive words like " insightful " and " meaningful " were added to prioritize recombinations . The parameters for generating responses , such as temperature , frequency penalty , and presence penalty , were ad - justed to balance creativity and coherence . A temperature value of 0 . 75 was used for moderate randomness , and frequency penalty and presence penalty values of 0 . 5 and 0 . 25 , respectively , were used to encourage unique and diverse responses without overly strict penalties . 3 . 2 Software Implementation This interface is developed using the React Framework in JavaScript , which is a popular choice for building user interfaces . React provides a set of reusable primitives that can be used to create interactive web applications . React Hooks are used to simplify the code making it easier to manage and reuse code across components . To store data , the system uses Firestore Backend as a service , which is a cloud - based NoSQL database offered by Google . Firestore provides scalable storage and real - time synchronization for mobile , web , and server applications . 4 DEMONSTRATION For the purposes of this demonstration , a preset design problem will be presented , each with six corresponding handpicked analogies . Three analogies would be from a domain with varying degrees of closeness to the problem while the remaining would be from a far , yet structurally related domain . The demo will invite engagement from the participants by giving them the freedom to play around with the magnets of the problem and analogies , mix them or add their own magnets to the Playspace to generate recombinations . We also hope to expand the demo , to accommodate for users problems instead of preset - ones if possible , to promote greater engagement with the audience . Since the proposed system is a Web - interface and given the virtual nature of the event , there is no additional requirement needed for setup .
