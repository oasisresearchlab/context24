However , the approach is currently limited by low levels of human cells ultimately represented in chimeric embryos . Different strategies have been developed to improve chimerism by genetically editing donor human PSCs . To date , however , it remains unexplored if human chimerism can be enhanced in animals through modifying the host embryos . Leveraging the interspecies PSC competition model , here we discovered retinoic acid - inducible gene I ( RIG - I ) - like receptor ( RLR ) signaling , an RNA sensor , in “winner” cells plays an important role in the competitive interactions between co - cultured mouse and human PSCs . We found that genetic inactivation of Ddx58 / Ifih1 - Mavs - Irf7 axis compromised the “winner” status of mouse PSCs and their ability to outcompete PSCs from evolutionarily distant species during co - culture . Furthermore , by using Mavs - deficient mouse embryos we substantially improved unmodified donor human cell survival . Comparative transcriptome analyses based on species - specific sequences suggest contact - dependent human - to - mouse transfer of RNAs likely plays a part in mediating the cross - species interactions . Taken together , these findings establish a previously unrecognized role of RNA sensing and innate immunity in “winner” cells during cell competition and provides a proof - of - concept for modifying host embryos , rather than donor PSCs , to enhance interspecies chimerism . Main text The technique of generating interspecies chimeras using human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) is a promising in vivo platform to study human development and offers a potential source for growing human donor organs in animals 1 , 2 . Although robust chimerism can be achieved between closely related species 3 , 4 , it is far more difficult to generate chimeras between evolutionarily distant species 5 . The low chimerism of human cells in animals ( e . g . , mice and pigs ) is presumably due to multiple xenogeneic barriers during early development , which include but are not limited to differences in developmental pace , incompatibility in cell adhesion molecules , and interspecies cell competition . Several strategies have been developed to improve human cell chimerism in animal embryos by genetically inhibiting human cell apoptosis 6 - 10 . However , these strategies are not practical for future use in regenerative medicine as the modified genes and pathways are mostly oncogenic . Improving survival and chimerism of unmodified donor hPSCs through editing the host embryos will be a preferred solution but has not been explored . We previously developed an interspecies PSC co - culture system and discovered a competitive interaction between primed but not naïve human and mouse PSCs , whereby loser hPSCs are eliminated by winner mouse epiblast stem cells ( mEpiSCs ) through apoptosis . Genetic inactivation of MyD88 , P65 or P53 in hPSCs could overcome human - mouse PSC competition , thereby improving human cell survival and chimerism in early mouse embryos 10 . In contrast to loser hPSCs , however , little is known regarding what enacts the winner status of mEpiSCs . To this end , we performed RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) of separately cultured and co - cultured mEpiSCs . H9 human embryonic stem ( ES ) cells and mEpiSCs were labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein ( eGFP ) and monomeric Kusabira Orange ( mKO ) , respectively . We isolated mEpiSCs from day 1 - 3 co - cultures and separated cultures by fluorescence - activated single cell sorting ( FACS ) for RNA - seq ( Fig . 1a , Extended Data Fig . 6a , b ) . Comparative transcriptome analysis identified 422 , 301 and 77 upregulated genes on days 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively , in co - cultured versus separately cultured mEpiSCs ( co - culture upregulated genes , or co - URGs ) ( Fig . 1b ) . Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) pathway analyses were performed using these co - URGs . Interestingly , many overrepresented pathways in days 1 and 2 co - URG groups were related to virus infection and innate immunity ( Extended Data Fig . 1a - c , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Among them , retinoic acid - inducible gene I ( RIG - I ) - like receptor ( RLR ) signaling pathway represents one of the major RNA sensing systems in mammalian cells , which can be activated by viral and host - derived RNAs 11 , 12 . RLR activation results in the transcriptional induction of type I interferons that mounts an antiviral host response 13 . RLR signaling participates in the maintenance of homeostatic genetic stability of cell populations and self - protection 11 , 14 . Several key component genes of the RLR pathway were significantly upregulated in days 1 - 2 co - cultured versus separately cultured mEpiSCs , including the cytoplasmic RNA sensors Ddx58 ( RIG - I ) 15 and Ifih1 ( MDA5 ) 16 , 17 and the downstream transcription factor Irf7 18 ( Fig . 1c , d , Extended Data Fig . 1d - f ) . Next , we determined whether the RLR pathway is intact in mEpiSCs . To this end , we transfected mEpiSCs with polyinosinic : polycytidylic acid ( also known as poly ( I : C ) ) , a double - stranded RNA analogue that can activate RLRs 19 , 20 . Native gel electrophoresis and western blotting revealed IRF3 dimerization , demonstrating an activated RLR signaling in poly ( I : C ) transfected mEpiSCs ( Fig . 1e ) . To confirm RLR pathway activation in mEpiSCs co - cultured with H9 hES cells , FACS - isolated mEpiSCs from day 2 co - culture and separate culture were subjected to protein extraction and native gel electrophoresis . Consistent with RNA - seq results , we found RLR pathway was activated as evidenced by IRF3 dimerization in co - cultured but not separately cultured mEpiSCs ( Fig . 1e ) . RLR pathway activation in co - cultured mEpiSCs seems to be contact - dependent as we did not observe upregulation of RLR - pathway - related genes in mEpiSCs co - cultured with H9 hES cells in trans - wells ( Extended Data Fig . 1g ) . Interestingly , when P65 KO - hiPSCs were used for co - culture , upregulated expression of RLR - pathway - related genes were still observed in mEpiSCs ( Extended Data Fig . 1h , i ) , demonstrating RLR signaling activation in mEpiSCs is independent of the outcomes of hPSCs during co - culture . In contrast to mEpiSCs , there was no apparent activation of the RLR signaling pathway in co - cultured H9 hES cells ( Extended Data Fig . 2a - i , Supplementary Table 2 ) . Collectively , during co - culture with loser hPSCs , our results uncovered an intriguing cell contact - dependent activation of RLRs in winner mEpiSCs . Mitochondrial anti - viral signaling protein ( MAVS ) is the central hub for RLR sensors and downstream signaling 18 , 21 - 23 . To determine whether RLR signaling contributes to human - mouse PSC competition , we knocked out Mavs in mEpiSCs ( Mavs KO mEpiSCs ) and confirmed Mavs deficiency did not affect self - renewal , proliferation and expression of key pluripotency transcription factors ( Extended Data Fig . 3a - c ) . IRF3 dimerization signal was lost in day 2 co - cultured Mavs KO mEpiSCs ( Fig . 1e ) and most RLR - pathway - related genes were expressed at comparable levels to separate cultures ( Fig . 1f ) , demonstrating Mavs knockout is effective in blocking RLR signaling in co - cultured mEpiSCs . Time - lapse confocal microscopy revealed better survival of H9 hES cells during co - culture with Mavs KO mEpiSCs than with WT mEpiSCs ( Supplementary Video 1 ) . Next , we calculated the cell densities ( cell number per cm 2 ) of live H9 hES cells and mEpiSCs in co - culture and separate culture daily until they grew to confluency ( days 1 - 5 ) . A more rapid elimination of H9 hES cells was observed during co - culture with WT than with Mavs KO mEpiSCs ( Fig . 2a ) . These results suggest compromised competitiveness of Mavs KO mEpiSCs . We also tested higher cell plating densities . Notably , on day 3 , significantly more H9 hES cells were found in co - cultures with Mavs KO than with WT mEpiSCs ( Fig . 2b , Extended Data Fig . 3d ) . To confirm this finding with an independent method , we performed automatic cell recognition and unbiased counting by using an image analysis software . To this end , eGFP - H2B labeled WT or Mavs KO mEpiSCs and / or mScarlet - H2B labeled H9 hES cells were plated in micropatterned plates . Fluorescence images were recorded over time for each micropatterned colony using confocal microscopy followed by image analysis and automated cell counting ( see Methods ) . In consistent , on day 3 , significantly higher numbers of live H9 hES cells were present in co - cultures with Mavs KO than with WT mEpiSCs ( Extended Data Fig . 3e , f ) . Interestingly , during co - culture with H9 hES cells , more Mavs KO mEpiSCs appeared to undergo cell death than WT mEpiSCs ( Supplementary Video 1 ) . In addition , starting from day 4 , in contrast to WT mEpiSCs , significantly lower densities of Mavs KO mEpiSCs were found in co - cultures than separate cultures ( Fig . 2a ) . These results suggest reduced viability of Mavs KO mEpiSCs during co - culture with H9 hES cells . In addition to Mavs , we individually knocked out genes upstream ( Ddx58 , Ifih1 ) and downstream ( Irf7 ) of Mavs in the RLR pathway in mEpiSCs . Ddx58 KO - , Ifih1 KO - and Irf7 KO - mEpiSCs all could be passaged long term in culture and maintained the expression of OCT4 and SOX2 ( Extended Data Fig . 4a , b ) . Similar to Mavs , deficiency of Ddx58 , Ifih1 and Irf7 also led to the significant reduction in mEpiSC densities during co - cultures with H9 hES cells ( Fig . 2c , Extended Data Fig . 4c ) . Together , these results reveal that both cell competitiveness and viability were compromised in winner mEpiSCs by depleting Mavs , and demonstrate the important role of RLR pathway in human - mouse PSC competition . In addition to human cells , mEpiSCs could outcompete rhesus macaque and bovine ES cells during co - cultures 10 . Next , we studied whether RLR signaling was involved in PSC competition between mouse and other species . We co - cultured WT and Mavs KO mEpiSCs with rhesus ( ORMES23 ) and bovine ES cells , respectively . On days 4 - 5 , there were evidently more rhesus and bovine ES cells remained in co - cultures with Mavs KO than with WT mEpiSCs , while significantly less Mavs KO mEpiSCs were found in co - cultures than WT mEpiSCs ( Fig . 2d , Extended Data Fig . 5a - c , Supplementary Video 2 ) . These findings demonstrate that , in the presence of rhesus and bovine ES cells , Mavs deficiency also diminished the competitiveness and fitness of mEpiSCs . When compared with separately cultured mEpiSCs , many RLR - pathway - related genes were upregulated in days 1 - 3 mEpiSCs co - cultured with bovine ES cells ( Extended Data Fig . 5d ) , consistent with what we found in human - mouse PSC co - cultures . Collectively , these results suggest conserved roles of RLR signaling during competitive interactions of mEpiSCs with primed PSCs from other species . To determine whether the suppression of RLR signaling in host mouse embryos could improve donor hPSC survival , we microinjected the same number ( 10 ) of eGFP labeled hiPSCs into WT and Mavs - / - mouse 24 blastocysts followed by ex vivo culture 25 ( Fig . 3a ) . After 3 and 5 days , eGFP signals were detected in most Mavs - / - embryos injected with hiPSCs , whereas fewer WT embryos contained eGFP + human cells ( Fig . 3b , c ) . To study human cell survival in Mavs - deficient mouse embryos in vivo , we electroporated WT mouse embryos with Cas9 protein and Mavs targeting sgRNAs at zygote stage , microinjected eGFP + hiPSCs to the blastocysts and then performed embryo transfer ( Fig . 3a ) . We found the percentages of embryonic day ( E ) 8 . 5 - 9 . 5 mouse embryos containing eGFP + signals were 18 . 75 % ( 6 out of 32 ) for Mavs - / - , but only 5 . 26 % ( 1 out of 19 ) for Mavs + / - and 0 % ( 0 out of 9 ) for Mavs + / + ( Fig . 3d ) . The presence of human cells in E8 . 5 - 9 . 5 Mavs - / - embryos was validated by immunostaining of eGFP ( Fig . 3e ) and genomic PCR using human - specific Al u ( TPA25 - Alu ) primers 26 ( Fig . 3f ) . Together , these results demonstrate genetic inactivation of RLR signaling in the host could improve unmodified donor human cell survival in early mouse embryos . Horizontal RNA transfer mediated by exosomes , free extracellular ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) particles , or tunneling nanotubes has been observed in mammals 27 - 30 . We speculated that the observed RLR signaling pathway activation in mEpiSCs during co - culture with hPSCs was likely caused by interspecies ( human - to - mouse ) horizontal RNA transfer . To look for evidence , we revisited our RNA - seq ( bulk ) data , which was generated from FACS - sorted cells based on fluorescence ( human , eGFP 10 ; mouse , mKO ) to minimize cross - species contamination ( Fig . 1a ) . To find out whether human RNAs are present in mEpiSCs , we first identified mouse - and human - specific reads , and used only these species - specific reads to calculate human genome mapping rates for each sequenced sample ( Fig . 4a ) . Interestingly , we detected a small proportion of human - specific reads in co - cultured mEpiSCs ( 0 . 57 % , 1 . 30 % and 0 . 33 % , for day 1 , day 2 , and day 3 , respectively ) , which was most prominent on day 2 and consistent with our finding on RLR signaling activation ( Fig . 4b , 1b , 1c ) . Similar results were obtained from mEpiSCs co - cultured with P65 KO - hiPSCs ( Extended Data Fig . 6c ) . We also performed the same analysis using RNA - seq data generated from non - contact ( transwell ) co - cultures ( Extended Data Fig . 6d ) . Interestingly , human - specific reads were barely detectable in both transwell co - cultured ( 0 . 05 % ) or separately cultured mEpiSCs ( 0 . 03 % ) ( Fig . 4b (cid:0) . Together , these results reveal the presence of human transcripts in co - cultured mEpiSCs , and suggest putative horizontal RNA transfer through physical connections ( e . g . , membrane nanotubes (cid:0) 28 (cid:0)(cid:0) ( e . g . , extracellular vesicles (cid:0) 27 . We then determined the abundance of human transcripts in co - cultured mEpiSCs and found it was positively correlated with gene expression levels in separately cultured H9 hES cells ( Fig . 4c ) . Stress - induced transcription of retrotransposable elements ( REs ) has recently been recognized to play an important role in RNA immune response 31 - 34 . Therefore , we interrogated multi - mapped reads in these RNA - seq datasets using pipelines designed 35 . Intriguingly , we detected the presence of human RNAs coding for both young and ancient retroelements in mouse EpiSCs , which was contact - dependent and correlated with abundance and peaked at day 2 ( Extended Data Fig . 7a , b ) . Of note is that the expression levels of human retroelements in H9 hES cells were not affected by culture conditions ( Extended Data Fig . 7c - f ) . Therefore , retroelement RNAs may contribute to RLR signaling activation in mouse cells . In addition , the non - functional exogenous eGFP sequences could also be detected in mEpiSCs specifically under co - cultured condition ( Extended Data Fig . 6e ) , providing further evidence that the putative interspecies horizontal RNA transfer process is random instead of selectively active transport . To rule out the possibility that the co - cultured mEpiSCs collected by FACS was contaminated with small amounts of human cells , we performed single cell RNA - seq ( scRNA - seq ) , using mEpiSCs isolated from day 2 co - culture and separate culture . After filtering out cells with low quality , we obtained transcriptome datasets from 16 , 225 cells including 6 , 969 and 9 , 256 cells in separate and co - cultured conditions , respectively ( Fig . 4d , Extended Data Fig . 8a ) . We performed unsupervised clustering and identified 9 clusters ( Fig . 4d ) . We observed significant differences in cell composition between separate and co - cultures : C2 , C3 and C6 clusters predominantly consisted of co - cultured cells , whereas C1 and C4 clusters were mainly from cells in separate culture ( Fig . 4e ) . To account for possible cell fusion or doublet generated in scRNA - seq library preparation process , as a control , we included “cross - species doublets” identified by multi - genome analysis by Cell Ranger . Consistent with bulk RNA - seq , scRNA - seq data also revealed significantly elevated mapping rates ( ~ 1 . 2 % ) to the human genome in co - cultured mEpiSCs , which was significantly higher than in separately cultured mEpiSCs ( ~ 0 . 1 % ) and much lower than “cross - species doublet” ( ~ 40 . 2 % ) ( Fig . 4f ) . UMAP visualization revealed that the presence of human RNAs could be detected in many co - cultured mEpiSCs ( Fig . 4g ) . In addition , eGFP transcripts from human cells were significantly increased in co - cultured versus separately cultured mEpiSCs , which was also significantly lower than those in “cross - species doublet” ( Extended Data Fig . 8b - d ) . Next , based on the scRNA - seq data , we performed expression correlation analysis of human transcripts , and found high Pearson correlation coefficients ( PCCs ) between co - cultured mEpiSCs and H9 hES cells , especially , genes with higher expression level in H9 hES cells are more likely to be detected in co - cultured mEpiSCs ( Extended Data Fig . 8e ) . These results confirmed the presence of human RNA in co - cultured mEpiSCs at single cell level and further suggest that the putative human - to - mouse RNA transfer is non - selective . In summary , we discovered RLR signaling pathway was activated in mEpiSCs during interspecies primed PSC competition . Genetic perturbation of key players in the RLR signaling pathway compromised the “winner” status of mEpiSCs , and thereby resulting in better survival of “loser” PSCs from evolutionarily distant species , including humans , rhesus monkeys and cattle . We further showed that by using Mavs - deficient mouse embryos as hosts , survival of unmodified donor hPSCs could be improved . In addition , we detected the presence of human transcripts encoding unique genes and retrotransposable elements in co - cultured mEpiSCs , putatively as a result a non - selective and contact dependent human - to - mouse RNA transfer . Future studies are warrantied to dissect the detailed molecular mechanisms and functional consequences underlying this horizontal RNA transfer between PSCs from different species . Our study uncovers an unexpected and intriguing role of RNA innate immunity in interspecies PSC competition and chimerism , and it’ll be interesting to determine whether the same mechanism also operates in “winner” cells in classical cell competition models such as Minute mutant 36 and dMyc 37 . By suppressing the RLR pathway in mouse embryos , we demonstrate the feasibility of modifying the host embryos to boost interspecies chimerism of donor PSCs , providing a framework for generating human tissues in animals that are more suitable for transplant in the future .

Methods Animals and ethical review CD - 1 ( ICR ) , C57BL / 6 and BDF1 mice were purchased from Envigo ( Harlen ) , Charles River , or Jackson Laboratory . Homozygous Mavs knockout mice were kindly gifted from Prof . Zhijian J . Chen 24 . Mice were housed in 12 - hr light / 12 - hr dark cycle at 22 . 1 – 22 . 3°C and 33 – 44 % humidity . All procedures related to animals were performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center ( UTSW ) . Animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UTSW Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) before any experiments were performed ( Protocols # 2018 - 102430 ) . All experiments followed the 2021 Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Clinical Translation released by the International Society for Stem Cell Research ( ISSCR ) . All human – mouse ex vivo and in vivo interspecies chimeric experimental studies were reviewed and approved by UT Southwestern Stem Cell Oversight Committee ( SCRO ) ( registration 14 ) . Primed PSC culture Human ES cell line H9 ( WA09 ) were obtained from WiCell and authenticated by short tandem repeat ( STR ) profiling . HFF - hiPS cells , mouse EpiSCs , rhesus macaque ES cells , and bovine ES cells were generated as previously described 5 , 38 , 39 . Human primed PSCs were either cultured on plates coated with Matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) in mTeSR1 medium ( STEMCell Technologies ) or on MEFs in NBFR medium , which contains DMEM / F12 ( Invitrogen ) and Neurobasal medium ( Invitrogen ) mixed at 1 : 1 ratio , 0 . 5× N2 supplement ( Invitrogen ) , 0 . 5× B27 supplement ( Invitrogen ) , 2 mM GlutaMax ( Gibco ) , 1× nonessential amino acids ( NEAA , Gibco ) , 0 . 1 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 20 ng mL −1 FGF2 ( PeproTech ) , 2 . 5 μM IWR1 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and 1 mg mL −1 BSA ( low fatty acid , MP Biomedicals ) . Mouse , rhesus and bovine primed PSCs were all cultured on MEFs in NBFR medium . Primed PSCs cultured in NBFR medium were passaged using TrypLE ( human , rhesus and bovine ) at 1 : 10 split ratio every 4 – 5 days , and 1 : 30 split ratio ( mouse ) every 3 – 4 days . Human primed PSCs cultured in mTeSR1 medium on Matrigel were passaged every five days using Dispase ( STEMCell Technologies ) at 1 : 10 split ratio . Generation of fluorescently labelled PSCs We used pCAG - IP - mKO and pCAG - IP - eGFP to label PSCs as previously described 10 . For generating nucleus labelled PSCs , we used piggyBac transposon vectors expressing eGFP - H2B and mScarlet - H2B . In brief , 3 μg piggyBac - eGFP - H2B or piggyBac - mScarlet - H2B plasmids were transfected together with 1 μg piggyBac transposase plasmid into 1 × 10 6 – 2 × 10 6 dissociated PSCs using NEPA21 electroporator ( Nepa Gene ) following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer . eGFP + or mScarlet + cells were collected by FACS at 48 h after transfection and replated . Single clones with stable fluorescence were manually picked between 7 and 14 days and further expanded clonally . Interspecies PSC co - culture PSCs from different species were seeded onto MEF - coated plates and either cultured separately or mixed at different ratios for co - cultures in NBFR medium . The seeding ratio and density were empirically tested and decided on the basis of cell growth rate . For 5 - days - co - culture assays between human - mouse , rhesus - mouse and bovine - mouse PSCs , cells were seeded at a 4 : 1 ratio at a density of 1 . 25 × 10 4 cells cm −2 . For human - mouse 3 - days - co - culture , seeding density was increased to 1 . 875 × 10 4 cells cm −2 but seeding ratio was kept at 4 : 1 . For transwell co - culture experiments , Millipore Transwell 0 . 4 μm PET hanging inserts ( Millicell , MCH12H48 ) were placed into 12 - well plates . Then coverslips were placed into both the upper insert and the bottom well , mEpiSCs and hES cells were seeded on the top insert and bottom well , respectively . At each of the indicated time points , cell concentration was manually counted and calculated , and the percentages of each cell line were determined using FACSCalibur system ( BD Bioscience ) . Total cell numbers ( tN ) for each species in co - cultures or separate cultures were determined by multiplying total cell volume ( V ) with cell concentration ( CC ) and percentage ( P ) . tN = V × CC × P . Cell density ( cells cm −2 ) was calculated by dividing the total cell number by the surface area . Micropattern imaging and automated cell counting The micropattern - based imaging was performed on CYTOO micropattern plates ( CYTOOplate 96w Custom A700 - P400 A ) . Specifically , the micropattern wells were coated with 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) Matrigel at 4 o C , O / N , and MEF feeder cells were seeded in each well one day before the experiment starts . On the day the experiment starts ( day 0 ) , unattached MEF feeder cells were washed out and then eGFP - H2B labeled WT or Mavs KO mEpiSCs and / or mScarlet - H2B labeled H9 hES cells were seeded into each well separately or mixed as indicated in the main text . On days 1 - 3 , individual micropattern colonies were tracked by live imaging . Cells were then fixed and DAPI stained on day 3 . Fluorescence imaging was performed on Nikon CSU - W1 SoRa spinning disk confocal microscope with 20x ( 0 . 75 NA , WD1 ( air ) ) objective . Z - stacks were acquired for each micropattern colony with 1µm step , approximately 30 - 75µm range in Z was covered depending on the thickness of each colony . Imaging experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results . Cell counting was performed on Imaris ( version 9 . 1 , Oxford Instruments ) by using the SPOTS function . Same parameters for computing of human and mouse cells were applied . Time - lapse imaging and analysis For time - lapse imaging of co - cultures using bowtie - shaped microwells 40 , the photoresist template was fabricated by negative photolithography as previously described 41 . The chrome mask was manufactured by the University of Texas at Dallas , and KMPR 1050 photoresist ( Microchem , Westborough , MA ) was used following the manufacturers’ instructions . Silicon ( PDMS ) molds were fabricated from Sylgard 184 Silicon Elastomer ( # 24236 - 10 – Electron Micro Sciences , Hatfield , PA ) . These PDMS stamps were sealed to glass coverslips with features - side down . A solution of 1 % Agarose ( # MIDSCI500 – Midsci , St . Louis , MO ) in distilled water ( C = 10 mg / mL ) was heated to 100 °C until the solution became crystal clear . Subsequently , 600 mL of this 1 % agarose solution was mixed with 400 mL of 100 % ethanol , and a drop of this hot agarose / ethanol solution was pipetted against the side of the PDMS stamp to perfuse through the gaps formed between the silicon mold and the coverslip . After several hours , the PDMS stamp was carefully removed from the coverslip with fine - tipped forceps . However , the agarose layers tend to detach from the glass coverslip in long - term cell culture conditions ( 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 ) . To solve this issue , we precoated the glass coverslips with an ultra - thin layer of polystyrene dissolved in chloroform ( 0 . 2 mg mL −1 ) . A small drop of this mixture was added onto each coverslip , which was then spin - coated ( ~ 100 rpm for 1 - 2 seconds followed by ~ 3 , 000 rpm for 4 - 6 second ) to spread the polystyrene uniformly . Finally , the coverslips were exposed to UV light in a tissue culture hood for 1 hour to graft the polystyrene layer prior to the addition of the agarose / ethanol solution . To setup an experiment , the coverslips holding the polystyrene / agarose layers were incubated with fibronectin in PBS ( 50 mg mL −1 ) for 1 h at 37 °C , rinsed twice with PBS and dried several minutes before cells were seeded on the coverslips in culture media . After 48 hours of incubation , the coverslips with the cells were placed in a 37 °C / 5 % CO 2 chamber for live imaging . The samples were imaged using a Leica SP8 inverted confocal microscope , equipped with a 40x oil objective . A z - stack of 8 images ( 1 , 024 x 1 , 024 pixels , z - step size 2 . 5 µm ) was recorded every 10 min for 24 h . Fluorescent signals ( 488 and 561 nm ) were collected sequentially to avoid any bleed - through using a 100 Hz scan rate . ImageJ ( NIH , 64 - bit Java 1 . 8 . 0 _ 172 ) was used to produce a maximum intensity projection of each z - stack . All the resulting 2D images were assembled into time - lapse videos . CRISPR knockout All single guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) used in this study were designed by using the online software ( MIT CRISPR Design Tool : http : / / crispr . mit . edu ) . The sequences of sgRNAs are included in Supplementary Table 3 . sgRNAs were cloned into the pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - eGFP ( Addgene , PX458 ) plasmid by ligating annealed oligonucleotides with BbsI - digested vector . 4 μg plasmid carrying the specific sgRNA was then transfected into 1 × 10 6 – 2 × 10 6 dissociated mEpiSCs using NEPA21 electroporator ( Nepa Gene ) . For generating large genomic fragment deletion at specific gene locus , two sgRNA plasmids were transfected simultaneously . eGFP + cells were collected by FACS at 48 h after transfection and replated . Single clones were picked and expanded . Homozygous knockout clones were confirmed by genomic PCR , Sanger sequencing and western blotting . Plasmids pCAG - IP - mKO and pCAG - IP - eGFP plasmids were gifts from T . Hishida . piggyBac - eGFP - H2B and piggyBac transposase plasmids were gifts from Aryeh Warmflash lab . piggyBac - mScarlet - H2B plasmid was generated by cloning mScarlet coding sequence and replaced eGFP coding sequence in piggyBac - eGFP - H2B . pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - eGFP ( PX458 ) plasmid was purchased from Addgene ( plasmid 48138 ) . Mouse embryo collection and electroporation Homozygous Mavs knockout or WT C57BL / 6 female mice ( 4 – 11 weeks old ) were superovulated by intraperitoneal ( IP ) injection with 7 . 5 IU of PMSG ( Prospec ) , followed by IP injection with 7 . 5 IU of hCG ( Sigma - Aldrich ) 48 h later . After mating with homozygous Mavs knockout or WT C57BL / 6 male mice , respectively , embryos were harvested at E2 . 5 [ the presence of a virginal plug was defined as embryonic day 0 . 5 ( E0 . 5 ) ] in KSOM - Hepes 5 by flushing oviducts and uterine horns . Embryos were cultured in the defined modified medium ( mKSOMaa ) 5 until blastocyst stage . For generating Mavs knockout blastocysts by CRISPR / Cas9 gene editing , mouse zygotes were collected from superovulated WT BDF1 female mice ( 3 – 4 weeks old ) crossed with WT BDF1 males at E0 . 5 and electroporated with RNP complex of Mavs targeting sgRNA ( 100 ng μL - 1 ) and Cas9 protein ( Takara Bio ; 500 ng μL - 1 ) using NEPA21 electroporator . The electroporated zygotes were cultured in mKSOMaa until blastocyst stage . Embryo culture was performed in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % ( v / v ) CO 2 and 20 % ( v / v ) O 2 at 37 °C . Microinjection of human iPS cells to mouse blastocysts Microinjection of human iPS cells into mouse blastocysts was performed as previously described 10 with slight modifications . Briefly , the embryos having obvious blastocoel at E3 . 5 were defined as blastocysts and fully expanded blastocysts were used for human iPS cell injections . Single cell suspensions of hiPS cells were added to a 40 μL droplet of KSOM - Hepes containing the blastocysts to be injected . Individual cells were collected into a 20 μm internal diameter of micropipette . Ten cells were introduced into the blastocoel near the ICM . Groups of 10 – 12 blastocysts were manipulated simultaneously , and each session was limited to 30 min . After microinjection , the blastocysts were cultured in mKSOMaa for at least 1 h until the ex vivo embryo culture or embryo transfer . For ex vivo embryo culture , we followed the previous protocol 25 . In brief , injected chimeric blastocysts were placed in ibiTreat μ - plate 8 wells ( ibidi GabH , 80826 ) containing IVC1 medium ( Cell guidance systems , M11 ) and cultured for 3 days in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % ( v / v ) CO 2 and 5 % ( v / v ) O 2 at 37 °C . IVC1 medium was replaced with equilibrated IVC2 medium ( Cell guidance systems , M12 ) and cultured for additional 2 days . Embryos were imaged using a fluorescence microscope ( Echo Laboratories ) . Mouse embryo transfer As surrogates , ICR female mice ( 8 weeks old or older ) in the proestrus were mated with vasectomized ICR male mice to induce pseudopregnancy . Embryo transfer to the surrogate at E2 . 5 performed surgically under anesthesia with ketamine / xylazine mixture ( ARC UTSW ) . hiPSC - injected blastocysts were loaded to the pipette with air bubble and transferred to the uterine horn , which were preliminary punctured with a 27G needle connected to a 1 . 5 mL syringe . 12 – 28 blastocysts were transferred per surrogate . After the transfer , opioid analgesic ( Buprenorphine HCL ) was treated . Pregnant female mice were euthanized on E8 . 5 - E9 . 5 , embryos were dissected and used for downstream analysis . Genomic PCR Genomic PCR was performed for detecting human - specific DNA in mouse embryos by DNA fingerprinting using primers for TPA25 - Alu . Genomic DNA of E8 . 5 - E9 . 5 mouse embryos and HFF - hiPS cells ( used as a positive control ) were extracted using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit ( Qiagen ) following the manufacturer ' s instructions , and then diluted to 30 ng μL - 1 as PCR templates . Genomic PCRs were performed using Hot Start Taq 2x Master Mix ( NEB ) . PTGER2 primers that bind to conserved sequences in both human and mouse were used as internal control . The PCR products were examined by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis . Primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 3 . Fluorescence imaging and immunohistochemistry analysis of mouse embryos Imaging of chimeric embryos was performed with a Zeiss Axio Zoom . V16 fluorescence stereo zoom microscope equipped with a Plan - Neofluar Z 1 . 0x / 0 . 25 ( FWD 56 mm ) objective and Axiocam 503 monochromatic camera . GFP - positive embryos were embedded in O . C . T . compound ( Fisher Healthcare ) without fixation and frozen on dry ice . Sections ( 12 μm thick ) were cut on a cryostat ( Leica CM 1950 ) , mounted on the glass slides ( Denville Scientific ) , and stored at - 80 °C for immunohistochemistry . All extra - sections and GFP - negative embryos were subjected to DNA extraction and genotyping for Mavs . For immunohistochemistry , sections were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 30 min at 4 °C , washed with PBS twice and permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 ( Fisher BioReagents ) in PBS twice for 5 min at room temperature . After antigen retrieval with 10 mM Citrate ( pH 6 . 0 ) containing 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ( Fisher BioReagents ) for 10 min at 90 - 95 °C , sections were blocked with blocking buffer [ 5 % ( w / v ) donkey serum ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 0 . 3 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 in PBS ] for 1 h . Then sections were incubated with the primary antibody ( chicken anti - GFP , Supplementary Table 4 ) diluted in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight , secondary antibody ( Donkey anti - chicken IgY conjugated with FITC , Supplementary Table 4 ) in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h , and finally 5 ng / mL DAPI solution at room temperature for 10 min . Autofluorescence was silenced with TrueBlack Lipofuscin Quencher ( Biotium , diluted 1 : 20 in 70 % ethanol ) and slides were mounted with PVA - DABCO . Samples were imaged using a confocal microscope ( Zeiss LSM 700 ) . Immunofluorescence Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 10 min at room temperature , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 15 min , and blocked with 5 % BSA and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 1 h .

Incubation with secondary antibodies ( Supplementary Table 4 ) in 1 % BSA and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 was performed for 1 h at room temperature . DAPI staining was applied for 10 min at room temperature . Coverslips were then mounted with PVA - DABCO on glass slides . The images of stained slides were taken by Revolve ( ECHO ) or Leica SP8 confocal microscope . Flow cytometry Cells were dissociated using TrypLE and fixed in 4 % PFA for 10 min at room temperature . Then cells were resuspended with PBS and subjected to flow cytometry analysis . Flow cytometry was performed using FACSCalibur system ( BD Bioscience ) and analyzed using FlowJo ( 10 . 8 . 1 ) . Western blotting and Native gel electrophoresis For western blotting , cells were lysed with RIPA Lysis Buffer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with protease inhibitor on ice and centrifuged at 12 , 000 g . The supernatant was mixed with 4× SDS Loading Buffer ( Bio - Rad ) and boiled at 95˚C for 10 min . Samples were loaded into 4 - 20 % Tris - Glycine gel ( Invitrogen Novex WedgeWell 4 to 20 % , Tris - Glycine ) and run at 150 V for 60 min . The gels were then transferred to PVDF membranes ( Bio - Rad ) and blocked with 5 % milk in TBST . Membranes were incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Immunoreactive bands were visualized using HRP conjugated secondary antibodies ( Supplementary Table 4 ) incubated with chemiluminescence substrate ( Pierce ECL western substrate , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and exposed to X - ray film . For native gel electrophoresis , cells were lysed with Lysis Buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 10 % Glycerol , 1 % NP - 40 , 5 mM Na 3 VO 4 and protease inhibitor ) on ice followed by 12 , 000 g centrifugation . The supernatant was mixed with 5× Native Loading Buffer ( 125 mM Tris , 0 . 96 M Glycine , 40 % Glycerol , 0 . 005 % Bromophenol Blue and 2 % DOC - Na ) . The Cathode Buffer ( 25 mM Tris , 192 mM Glycine and 0 . 4 % DOC - Na ) and the Anode Buffer ( 25 mM Tris and 192 mM Glycine ) were applied . 10 % Tris - Glycine gel ( Invitrogen Novex 10 % Tris - Glycine gel ) was pre - run at 200V for 70 min in the cold room until current dropped to 10 mA / Gel . The samples were loaded and run at 200 V for 60 min in the cold room . The gels were then transferred , blocked with 5 % milk in TBST and blotted with anti - IRF3 antibody ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . RNA isolation and quantitative RT – PCR analysis Both co - cultured and separately cultured cells were sorted out and collected based on fluorescent labelling using FACS at each of the indicated time points . Total RNAs were extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) . cDNA was synthesized using iScript™ Reverse Transcription Supermix ( Bio - Rad ) . Quantitative reverse transcription PCR ( qRT – PCR ) was carried out using SYBR Green Master Mix ( Qiagen ) on CFX384 system ( Bio - Rad ) . Reactions were run in triplicate and expression level of each gene was normalized to the geometric mean of Gapdh as a housekeeping gene and analysed by using the ΔΔCt method by Bio - Rad Maestro 1 . 0 . The qRT – PCR primer sequences of each gene are listed in Supplementary Table 3 . Bulk RNA - seq quality control and data analysis RNA - seq reads were first filtered by SOAPnuke ( Version : 1 . 5 . 6 ) 42 with parameters “ - l 15 - q 0 . 2 - n 0 . 05 - Q 2” . The high - quality reads were mapped to the mouse genome ( 2020 - A , mm10 ) and the human genome ( 2020 - A , GRCh38 ) downloaded from the 10X Genomics website using HISAT2 ( Version : 2 . 1 . 0 ) 43 with parameters “ - k 1 - p 2 - S - - novel - splicesite - outfile - q - - no - unal - - dta - - un - conc - gz” . SAMtools ( Version : 1 . 5 ) 44 was used to sort the BAM files produced by HISAT2 . The expression levels of annotated genes were calculated by transcript per million ( TPM ) using StringTie ( Version : 2 . 1 . 4 ) 45 with parameters “ - t - C - e - B - A - p 2” . Fold change was calculated by TPM + 1 to avoid infinity . A fold change > = 2 or < = 0 . 5 , a P value and an adjusted P value calculated by DESeq2 46 less than 0 . 05 and 0 . 1 , were used as cutoffs to define differentially expressed genes . KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of up - regulated mouse and human genes were performed by DAVID 47 ( Version : 2021 Update ) with mouse ( Mus musculus ) and human ( Homo sapiens ) as the backgrounds . Default thresholds ( Count > 2 , EASE < 0 . 1 ) were used to define enriched KEGG pathways . scRNA - seq quality control and data analysis scRNA - seq reads were processed by Cell Ranger ( Version : 5 . 0 . 1 ) using parameters “ - - localcores = 24 - - localmem = 400 - - transcriptome - - fastqs” with the mouse genome annotation ( 2020 - A , mm10 ) and the human genome annotation ( 2020 - A , GRCh38 ) . Multigenome analysis using the human - mouse genome ( GRCh38 - and - mm10 - 2020 - A ) of Cell Ranger was performed to distinguish mouse cells and human cells from cross - species doublets . scRNA - seq analysis was performed using Seurat ( Version : 4 . 0 . 4 ) 48 . DoubletFinder ( Version : 2 . 0 . 3 ) 49 was used to remove intra - species doublets with parameters “pN = 0 . 25 ， nExp = round ( 0 . 05 * length ( colnames ( obj ) ) ) ” . Clusters of mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were removed based on the following features : ( 1 ) they were present in all samples ; ( 2 ) they were mouse cells ; ( 3 ) they expressed marker genes of MEFs ; and ( 4 ) they did not express marker genes of mEpiSCs . For mouse cells , cells with less than 500 genes or UMI less than 1 , 000 or mitochondrial ratio greater than 10 % were removed . Finally , a total of 16 , 225 mouse cells were kept for further analysis . Cell clustering and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection ( UMAP ) visualization were performed using the “FindClusters” and “RunUMAP” functions of Seurat , respectively . Identification of mouse - / human - specific and eGFP - / hKO - specific reads To identify species - or fluorescent gene - specific reads , the high - quality bulk RNA - seq of each sample and scRNA - seq reads of each cell were mapped to both mouse and human genomes , or eGFP and hKO sequences , respectively . Reads that could be mapped to both genomes or both fluorescent gene sequences were removed . This process was repeated many times until there were only species - or fluorescent gene - specific reads left , which were used to calculate mouse / human genome mapping rates , measure eGFP / hKO expression levels , and detect eGFP + / hKO + cells . Reads per million ( RPM ) was used to calculate normalized expression levels of human transcripts and eGFP / hKO . eGFP + / hKO + cells were defined as cells with eGFP - / hKO - specific reads > = 1 . Retrotransposable element analysis RNA sequencing fastq files were preprocessed with Cutadapt v . 1 . 18 and Prinseq v . 0 . 20 . 4 to remove residual adapter sequences , low quality reads and bases 50 , 51 . Remaining reads were aligned with STAR v . 2 . 6 . 0 ( - - twopassMode Basic - - outFilterMultimapScoreRange 2 - - winAnchorMultimapNmax 1000 - - outFilterMultimapNmax 10000 - - outFilterMismatchNmax 20 - - scoreDelOpen - 1 - - scoreDelBase - 1 - - scoreInsOpen - 1 - - scoreInsBase - 1 ) to both the hg38 assembly of the human genome and the mm10 assembly of the mouse genome using the UCSC transcriptome annotation 52 . Picard v . 2 . 18 . 9 ( http : / / broadinstitute . github . io / picard / ) and SAMtools v . 1 . 9 were used to identify and filter PCR duplicates 44 . Read counting was performed with HTseq v . 0 . 11 . 0 using only unique reads aligning to UCSC annotated gene transcripts 53 . The resulting gene counts file was used for Deseq2 v 2 . 11 . 40 . 6 TMM normalization and differential gene expression analysis 46 . Normalized stranded bigwig files for visualization were generated using the Deeptools v 3 . 0 . 1 BamCoverage tool ( - - binSize 5 - - normalizeUsing CPM - - minMappingQuality 255 - - filterRNAstrand forward / reverse - - samFlagExclude 1024 ) 54 . Retroelement expression levels were determined using a customized pipeline 55 . A general transfer format ( GTF ) file containing RepeatMasker retroelement annotations was generated for the hg38 human and mm10 mouse genome assemblies 56 . This annotation file contains the genomic coordinates , strand , conservation scores relative to consensus sequence , and relational information for RepeatMasker each annotated repetitive element ( element name , repeat family , and repeat class ) . We further identified and denoted the most highly conserved , full length retroelement copies present in these genomes . Reads aligning to individual repetitive elements , reads aligning to specific families of repeat elements , and reads aligning to repetitive sequences classes were counted using HTseq 53 . Reads multiply mapped to more than one individual copy of an element , element within a given family or class of elements were counted only once when calculating read counts at the element , class or family levels . Repetitive sequence read counts were normalized using the Deseq2 scale factors generated above . As a quality control metric , reads derived from the opposite strand from the retroelement - encoding strand were also counted . Statistics Data were presented as mean ± s . e . m . from at least three independent experiments . Differences between groups were evaluated by Student’s t - test ( two - sided ) or one - way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison , and considered to be statistically significant if P < 0 . 05 . Graphic analyses were done using GraphPad Prism version 9 . 0 ( GraphPad Software ) . Statistical analyses were done using the Microsoft Excel ( Microsoft 365 ) .
