AFM is particularly well suited for biology , as it allows multiple characterizations ( topography , mechanical and adhesive proper - ties ) of living cells in their physiological environments . However , a prerequisite for such AFM experiments is the immobilization of the biological samples probed . However , this crucial step is often a challenge , as samples have to be immobilized individually and firmly enough to withstand the lateral forces exerted by the AFM tip , but without altering their cellular integrity . Immobilization of cells for AFM experiments Several techniques have been used to immobilize living cells . Living cells such as microorganisms can be chemically fixed on a solid substrate using glutaraldehyde or ( 3 - aminopropyl ) triethox ysilane ( APTES ) 3 , or they can be immobilized on gelatin - coated surfaces 4 . However , these techniques can , respectively , modify the interface of the biological sample , or they can pollute the AFM tips , leading to artifacts . Another strategy is to trap round - shaped cells such as bacterial cocci and yeast cells in the pores of polycarbonate membranes by filtration 5 or in lithographically patterned substrates by gentle drying 6 . The filtration technique has been widely used over recent years 7 – 10 , although it is time - consuming and cells can be exposed to mechanical forces when trapped in the pores . We therefore developed a new and versatile strategy in 2011 ( refs . 11 – 13 ) , which consists of immobilizing round single living cells in microstructured PDMS stamps by convective / capillary deposition . We have demonstrated that this generic protocol can be used to immobilize different types of round cells , ranging from small cocci bacteria to yeasts cells and even algae , by tuning the geometry of the PDMS stamp patterns ( Supplementary Data ) . This approach was also exploited to immobilize yeast cells of dif - ferent species , Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans 14 – 16 , as well as spores of Aspergillus fumigatus 17 . Statistical significance of results obtained from AFM : the new challenge Statistical analysis of results is desirable . As AFM is a tool adapted for single - cell analysis , this technology requires the analysis of multiple cells in order to achieve statistical confidence . This can - not be performed using techniques such as immobilization in a pore filter , as the deposition of the cells on the surface is random and the rate of filled pores is low and not controlled . By using our method of immobilization , it is possible to generate arrays of cells ; therefore , AFM results on an array of 100 cells can be performed using different AFM modes , such as multiparametric imaging , chemical force microscopy , single - molecule force spec - troscopy and single - cell force spectroscopy 14 , 18 – 21 . Such setups are effectively ‘lab chips’ for AFM analysis . With the progress made in AFM data processing software 22 , it is thus possible to take all the data acquired to analyze in a reasonable time period , so as to generate relevant and statistically significant results for biologi - cal studies . Overview of the procedure Immobilization of living cells in PDMS stamps involves three sequential stages . The first stage is the generation of a glass and chromium mask that harbors microstructured patterns , and the transfer of these patterns onto a silicon wafer . The second stage consists of the preparation of a corresponding PDMS stamp . Finally , the third stage is the assembly of the living cells into the PDMS microstructured stamps . The generation of a silicon master is achieved by photolithography , followed by pattern transfer Generation of living cell arrays for atomic force microscopy studies Cécile Formosa 1 – 4 , Flavien Pillet 2 , 5 , Marion Schiavone 1 , 2 , 6 , Raphaël E Duval 3 , 4 , 7 , Laurence Ressier 2 , 8 & Etienne Dague 1 , 2 1 Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique ( CNRS ) , Laboratoire d’Analyse et d’Architecture des Systèmes ( LAAS ) , Toulouse , France . 2 Université de Toulouse ; LAAS , Institut des Technologies Avancées en Sciences du Vivant ( ITAV ) , Institute de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale ( IPBS ) , Toulouse , France . 3 CNRS , Unité Mixte de Recherche ( UMR ) 7565 , Laboratoire Structure et Réactivité des Systèmes Moléculaires Complexes ( SRSMC ) , Vandœuvre - lès - Nancy , France . 4 Université de Lorraine , UMR 7565 , Faculté de Pharmacie , Nancy , France . 5 CNRS , IPBS , UMR 5089 , Toulouse , France . 6 L’Institut National de la Recherche Agronomie ( INRA ) , UMR 972 Laboratoire d’Ingénierie des Systèmes Biologiques et des Procédés ( LISBP ) , Toulouse , France . 7 ABC Platform , Nancy , France . 8 Université de Toulouse , Laboratoire de Physique et Chimie de Nano - Objets ( LPCNO ) , L’Institut National des Sciences Appliquées ( INSA ) - CNRS - Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier , Toulouse , France .

Published online 31 December 2014 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / nprot . 2015 . 004 atomic force microscopy ( aFM ) is a useful tool for studying the morphology or the nanomechanical and adhesive properties of live microorganisms under physiological conditions . However , to perform aFM imaging , living cells must be immobilized firmly enough to withstand the lateral forces exerted by the scanning tip , but without denaturing them . this protocol describes how to immobilize living cells , ranging from spores of bacteria to yeast cells , into polydimethylsiloxane ( pDMs ) stamps , with no chemical or physical denaturation . this protocol generates arrays of living cells , allowing statistically relevant measurements to be obtained from aFM measurements , which can increase the relevance of results . the first step of the protocol is to generate a microstructured silicon master , from which many microstructured pDMs stamps can be replicated . living cells are finally assembled into the microstructures of these pDMs stamps using a convective and capillary assembly . the complete procedure can be performed in 1 week , although the first step is done only once , and thus repeats can be completed within 1 d . © 201 4 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

The patterns of the silicon master are squares , 1 . 5 – 6 µ m wide , with a pitch of 0 . 5 µ m and a depth ranging from 1 to 4 µ m . The measurements of the silicon master should be verified using profilometry . These pat - tern geometries allow immobilization of a wide range of microorganisms of different sizes ( Fig . 1a ) . For example , patterns with a width of 4 – 5 µ m and a depth of 4 µ m are best suited for yeast cells such as C . albicans or S . cerevisiae , whereas patterns 1 . 5 – 2 µ m wide with a depth of 2 µ m can be used to image smaller cells such as spores of fungi or round bacteria . For the second stage of fabricating a PDMS stamp , a PDMS pre - polymer solution is cured on the silicon master produced in stage one , and then it is demolded to obtain the microstructured PDMS stamps ( Fig . 1b ) . The deposition of cells into the microstructured PDMS stamps is accomplished using convective and capillary deposition . Adjustment of parameters such as temperature , humid - ity , translation speed and contact angle will ensure a high rate of cell trapping , and they do not affect the cell interface , as cells are put back into liquid immediately after the procedure . This stage can also be done manually if highly organized arrays of cells are not mandatory for the AFM experiments . The filling rate and the quality of the PDMS stamp can easily be verified by optical micro - scopy . PDMS , being a biocompatible and transparent polymer 23 , 24 , does not induce any chemical modification of the cells in contact with it , and it can be used with straight or inverted optical or fluorescence microscopes that are combined with AFMs . Technical details of the procedure to generate a patterned glass and chromium mask and transfer the patterns to a silicon master , to fabricate PDMS stamps molded on the silicon master and to assemble arrays of living cells into the microstructured PDMS stamps are described below . We demonstrate the type of AFM results obtained on living cells by showing the results obtained from the medically important yeast pathogen C . albicans , immo - bilized into PDMS microstructures . The versatility of this pro - tocol has been demonstrated for other microorganisms 14 – 17 . We anticipate that this approach will be useful for researchers interested in studying microorganisms with AFM at a popula - tion scale , as well as for biophysicists interested in generating cell arrays for applications in diagnostic or biodetection .

Cell solutions should be freshly prepared before AFM experiments . Sodium acetate buffer For AFM experiments , prepare a sodium acetate buffer solution containing 18 mM sodium acetate , 1 mM CaCl 2 and 1 mM MnCl2 . Adjust the pH of the solution to 5 . 2 with glacial acetic acid . The solution can be stored at 4 °C for 2 months . proceDureGeneration of the silicon wafer ● tIMInG ~ 1 week 1 | Design the desired micropatterns of the silicon master using the CleWin software ( see supplementary Data for a CleWin file of the design used ) . 2 | Write the patterns using laser lithography ( Heidelberg DWL 200 ) to make a glass and chromium mask .  pause poInt The mask can be stored at room temperature for several months in ambient conditions at 20 °C and 40 % humidity ( no degradation with time ) . 3 | Clean a virgin silicon wafer under oxygen ( pressure of 1 . 7 mBar ) plasma for 15 min at 800 W , using the oxygen plasma Tepla 300 . The temperature of the substrate during this step is 20 °C at the beginning of the procedure , and it is 80 °C at the end . 4 | Deposit hexamethyldisilazane in solution on the clean silicon master to promote adherence of the photoresist . 5 | Deposit the photoresist AZ ECI 3012 on the silicon master using the EVG 120 automatic coating / developing machine ( 5 s of deposition and 30 s of spinning ) , and bake it for 60 s at 90 °C on a hot plate ( baking is included in the EVG 120 coating recipe ) . 6 | Expose the silicon master covered by the photoresist through the glass and chromium mask using the mask aligner MA 150 for 10 s .  crItIcal step During exposition , a crucial parameter is the type of contact between the glass and chromium mask and the silicon master . This parameter is chosen on the mask aligner MA 150 . The stronger the contact between the mask and the wafer , the weaker the diffraction of the UV during exposition , and the better the resolution of the patterns . For small patterns ( under 5 µ m ) , it is necessary to use the strongest mode of contact between the mask and the wafer , called vacuum contact . In this mode , the wafer is pushed toward the mask , a joint is applied around the wafer and the air between the mask and the wafer is pumped out to generate vacuum . 7 | After exposure , bake the silicon master for 60 s at 110 °C on a standard hot plate in ambient air ( 20 °C and 40 % humidity ) to complete polymerization of the exposed photoresist . 8 | Shape the patterns by dissolving the exposed photoresist in a solution of MF CD - 26 developer for 20 s .  crItIcal step During development , a crucial parameter is time . Indeed , if the development is too long , the MF CD - 26 solution starts to attack the photoresist patterns , leading to the removal of the smallest ones . 9 | Rinse both faces of the silicon master using deionized H 2 O , and dry them under nitrogen . 10 | Perform RIE on the silicon master using the Multiplex Alcatel AMS 4200 . This step must be realized under plasma of sulfur hexafluoride ( SF 6 , 200 sccm ) and octafluorocyclobutane ( C 4 F 8 , 400 sccm ) at a pressure of 0 . 07 mBar and a power of 2 , 800 W ( inductively coupled plasma ) . 11 | Remove the remaining photoresist from the silicon master under oxygen ( pressure of 1 . 7 mBar ) plasma for 15 min at 800 W , using the oxygen plasma Tepla 300 . The temperature of the substrate during this step is 20 °C at the beginning of the procedure , and it is 80 °C at the end . 12 | Put the silicon master in octadecyltrichlorosilane in liquid phase in order to render the silicon wafer anti - adhesive .  pause poInt The silicon master is generated only once , and it can be used hundreds of times . It can be stored in ambient air ( 20 °C and 40 % humidity ) for several years when protected in an individual plastic container . © 201 4 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

To avoid this , the silicon master with the PDMS can be degassed again under vacuum . 16 | Cure the PDMS solution on the silicon master for 1 h at 80 °C , in ambient air ( 40 % humidity ) .  pause poInt The PDMS cured on the silicon master can be stored at room temperature for several months . To avoid contamination , it is recommended to store the PDMS stamps at room temperature in ambient air , molded on the silicon master . 17 | Cut with a scalpel and demold the microstructured PDMS motif .  crItIcal step Cutting a PDMS motif off the silicon master can be crucial ; the scalpel must be used gently to avoid scratching or splitting of the silicon master . assembly of living cells in the microstructured pDMs stamps ● tIMInG ~ 20 min 18 | Deposit a PDMS stamp bearing the microstructured motif on a freshly cleaned glass slide . 19 | Deposit a 60 - µ l droplet of the cell suspension on the PDMS stamp .  crItIcal step The PDMS stamp is hydrophobic , and the droplet of cells sometimes does not cover up the entire PDMS stamp . To avoid this problem , it is possible to render it hydrophilic by briefly activating it under oxygen plasma for 30 s at 200 W . 20 | Assemble the cells into the PDMS microstructure . This can be performed in two different ways : on a convective and capillary setup ( option A ) or manually ( option B ) . ( a ) on a convective and capillary setup ( i ) Drag a droplet of the C . albicans cells onto the PDMS stamp at a given temperature ( 30 °C ) , humidity ( 45 % ) and translation speed ( 2 µ m / s ) using a motorized linear stage . ( B ) Manually ( i ) Use a coverslip to drag the droplet of cells several times onto the PDMS stamp . ? trouBlesHootInG 21 | Use an atomic force microscope with an inverted optical microscope to verify the filling of the wells . If the filling is good , proceed to performing an AFM experiment with the whole PDMS stamp under liquid . Use an AFM procedure adapted to the types of measurements needed on the samples ( imaging , probing of nanomechanical or adhesive properties , and multiparametric imaging ) 18 , 25 . If the wells are not filled , repeat Steps 19 – 21 . ? trouBlesHootInG cells have not filled the pDMs microstructures ( step 20B ( i ) ) Filling of the microstructured wells is a crucial step , whose success depends on the convective and capillary parameters , or on the type of microorganisms used . If after the convective and capillary assembly no cells or very few cells have filled the PDMS microstructured wells , it is possible that the convective and capillary assembly was too fast ; hence , reducing the speed can lead to better results . It can also be caused by an insufficient concentration of cells in the droplet . In this case , the cell suspension can be concentrated by centrifugation , and it can be resuspended in a smaller volume of the buffer used , in order to increase the probability of filling the wells . Finally , another possible reason is the surface hydrophobicity of cells . In C . albicans cells , which are very adhesive , working with hydrophobic PDMS stamps is better . However , in other yeast strains , such as S . cerevisiae , that present less adhesins at the surface , a hydrophobic surface will keep them from filling the wells . In this case , we advise working with hydrophilic stamps . Making the stamp hydrophilic can easily be achieved by UV - O 3 or O 2 plasma treatment . ● tIMInG Steps 1 – 12 , generation of the silicon wafer : ~ 1 week Steps 13 – 17 , fabrication of a microstructured PDMS stamp : ~ 3 h Steps 18 – 21 , assembly of living cells in the microstructured PDMS stamps : ~ 20 min © 201 4 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

Figure 2 shows PDMS stamps that have been characterized using AFM ; cross - sections indicate the different sizes that can be obtained on the PDMS stamp . A key advantage of this protocol is that it allows the generation of cell arrays , which enables an increased sample size and hence statistical power , and gives access to population heterogeneity data . Figure 3 shows the results obtained using this protocol to generate a cell array of C . albicans , with AFM imaging using Quantitative Imaging mode from JPK Instruments 14 , 26 . These data show that this protocol generates cell arrays , as all the 16 wells of 4 . 5 × 4 . 5 µ m 2 ( 830 pixels per well ) were filled with cells . It also shows the heterogeneity that exists between cells . Indeed , as we can see in this figure , some cells are higher than others , present a bigger diameter , or are in a budding process . Force measurements can be performed on each of the cells present in this array , thus giving access to their mechanical or adhesive properties . By using multiparametric imaging ( Quantitative Imaging mode , in this case ) , one image of an entire cell array can lead to the quantification of the nanomechanical properties ( i . e . , Young modulus ) and the adhesive properties 500 a b c d e f g h i j 5 µ m 5 µ m 5 µ m 5 µ m 5 µ m 5 µ m 5 µ m 5 µ m 5 µ m 400 300 200 100 0 0 5 15 10 20 0 5 10 15 20 Distance ( µ m ) Distance ( µ m ) H e i gh t ( n m ) 0 5 10 15 20 Distance ( µ m ) 0 5 10 15 20 Distance ( µ m ) 0 5 10 15 20 Distance ( µ m ) 500 400 300 200 100 0 0 5 15 10 20 0 5 10 15 20 Distance ( µ m ) Distance ( µ m ) H e i gh t ( n m ) 0 5 10 15 20 Distance ( µ m ) 0 5 10 15 20 Distance ( µ m ) 5 µ m 0 5 10 15 20 Distance ( µ m ) Figure 2 | Characterization of the PDMS stamps obtained .

Figure 4a shows a height image of a cell array of 10 × 10 wells of 5 × 5 µ m 2 ( 165 pixels per well ) , presenting a filling rate of 85 % . Figure 4b shows the elasticity map corresponding to the height image , and Figure 3c presents the adhesion image corresponding to the height image . This set of data clearly shows the power of such a protocol used in combination with advanced AFM modes such as multiparametric imaging . Indeed , in one acquisition performed ( 165 pixels per well , 2 . 64 s of acquisition per wells ) , 85 cells were imaged , and they were probed for their nanomechanical properties and for their surface adhesive properties . It is clearly visible on Figure 4b , c that the same population of cells exhibits heterogeneity ; this point was first evoked in our study in 2011 ( ref . 11 ) . Thus , cells of C . albicans that have grown in the same culture medium present different surface adhesive properties and cell wall Young modulus . If needed , high - magnification and high - resolution multiparametric data ( height , adhesion and stiffness ) can be recorded on single cells 27 . Owing to the versatility of this proto - col , similar results can be obtained for microorganisms of different sizes , such as cocci bacteria , other yeast species or algae . This protocol opens an avenue to further developments that could lead to great advances in the field of microbiology . Indeed , the PDMS stamp could be coupled with a microfluidic system to add different substances ( such as antifungals ) to each well . By probing the nanoscale characteristics of the cells present in these two wells at the same time , a direct comparison of the effects of the two different substances could be performed .
