In this work , we report the e ﬀ ect of alkylation on the cellular uptake of densely polyethylene glycol - coated nanoparticles , which are characterized by their limited entry into mammalian cells . Speci ﬁ cally , we prepare densely PEGylated gold nanoparticles that bear alkyl chains of varying carbon chain lengths ( n ) and loading densities ( termed “ alkyl - PEG - AuNPs ” ) , followed by investigating their uptake by Kera - 308 keratinocytes . Strikingly , provided a modest alkyl mass percentage of 0 . 2 % ( 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional lipid - based NPs ) in their PEG shells , dodecyl - PEG - AuNPs ( n = 12 ) and octadecyl - PEG - AuNPs ( n = 18 ) can enter Kera - 308 cells 30 - fold more than methoxy - PEG - AuNPs ( no alkyl groups ) and hexyl - PEG - AuNPs ( n = 6 ) after 24 h of incubation . Such strong dependence on n is valid for all serum concentrations considered ( even under serum - free conditions ) , although enhanced serum levels can trigger the agglomeration of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs ( without permanent aggregation of the AuNP cores ) and can attenuate their cellular uptake . Additionally , alkyl - PEG - AuNPs can rapidly enter Kera - 308 cells via the ﬁ lipodia - mediated pathway , engaging the tips of membrane protrusions and accumulating within interdigital folds . Most alkyl - PEG - AuNPs adopt the “ endo - lysosomal ” route of tra ﬃ cking , but ∼ 15 % of them accumulate in the cytosol . Regardless of intracellular location , alkyl - PEG - AuNPs predominantly appear as individual entities after 24 h of incubation . Our work o ﬀ ers insights into the incorporation of alkyl groups for designing bionanomaterials for cellular uptake and cytosolic accumulation with intracellular stability . KEYWORDS : alkylation , cellular uptake , gold nanoparticles , polyethylene glycol , ﬁ lopodia A lkyl groups ( C n H 2 n + 1 ) are prevalent in engineered bionanomaterials that are utilized in a multitude of intracellular applications , such as phospholipid - coated quantum dots for molecular imaging , 1 , 2 lipid nanoparticles ( NPs ) for gene delivery , 3 , 4 and cholesterol - coated 5 , 6 or vitamin E - coated 7 , 8 NPs for drug delivery . Motivated by the ability of alkyl - containing NPs to enter mammalian cells , previous researchers extensively elucidated the mechanisms for their endocytosis . Poste et al . showed that liposomes can enter ﬁ broblasts via endocytosis or fusion with the cell membrane . 9 Recently , Gilleron et al . proved that lipid NPs can enter cancer cells by clathrin - mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis . 4 These investigations treated the alkyl - containing NP as a single entity , yet fell short of addressing , at the functional group level , how its constituent alkyl groups in ﬂ uence the cellular uptake of the NP . While other related studies tangentially covered the interactions between alkyl - containing NPs and the cell , the primary e ﬀ ects of alkyl groups on these interactions were inconclusive because the emphasis of these comparative studies did not lie on alkyl groups alone . 10 − 13 For example , Rotello and co - workers compared the exocytosis properties and immune responses of NPs bearing various functional groups . Notably , they observed that NPs functionalized with cyclohexyl groups can trigger more secretion of pro - in ﬂ ammatory cytokines by splenocytes than those with alkyl groups . 11 They later showed that benzyl - containing NPs are more e ﬀ ectively exocytosed by breast cancer cells than their alkyl - containing counterparts . 12 In another comparative study , Irvine and Stellacci explored how Received : March 24 , 2017 Accepted : May 31 , 2017 Published : May 31 , 2017 A r t i c l e www . acsnano . org © 2017 American Chemical Society 6085 DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02044 ACS Nano 2017 , 11 , 6085 − 6101 the spatial distribution of alkyl groups on the NP surface may a ﬀ ect cellular uptake . Interestingly , they observed that those with uncharged alkyl groups orderly patterned on their surface can enter dendritic cells by directly penetrating the cell membrane , but those containing randomly distributed un - charged alkyl groups on their surface cannot . 13 Nevertheless , these previous studies did not address how alkyl as a functional group can a ﬀ ect the interactions between NPs and the cell . In this work , we will derive mechanistic understanding in the role of alkylation in the cellular uptake of NPs . To do so , we will prepare a series of alkyl - terminated , densely polyethylene glycol - coated gold NPs ( termed “ alkyl - PEG - AuNPs ” ) . These NPs consist of a 25 nm AuNP core , a dense shell of PEG strands covalently attached to the surface of the AuNP , and de ﬁ ned amounts of alkyl groups connected to the distal end of the tethered PEG strands ( Figure 1 ) . In our NP design , the spatial distribution of alkyl chains di ﬀ ers from that of other conventional alkyl - containing NPs . For liposomes , the alkyl chains are buried in the interior of the phospholipid bilayer . 14 For lipid NPs , the alkyl groups are mostly located inside the Figure 1 . Preparation of alkyl - terminated , densely polyethylene glycol - coated gold NPs ( alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs ) . ( A ) Synthesis of thiol - and alkyl - terminated PEG strands ( HS - PEG - C n H 2 n + 1 ) . Alkylamine ( H 2 N - C n H 2 n + 1 ) of various carbon chain lengths ( n = 6 , hexyl ; n = 12 , dodecyl ; n = 18 , octadecyl ) is covalently linked to a thiol - and carboxy - terminated bifunctional PEG linker ( HS - PEG - COOH ) via EDC / NHS chemistry . ( B ) Preparation of alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs . Di ﬀ erent mole ratios of thiol - and alkyl - terminated PEG [ HS - PEG - alkyl ; x mol % ] to thiol - and methoxy - terminated PEG [ HS - PEG - OCH 3 ; ( 100 − x ) mol % ] are coupled to the surface of citrate - capped AuNPs of 25 nm in diameter via gold - sulfur linkages .

Negative staining of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs by phosphotungstic acid reveals the dense PEG shell around the AuNP core . All PEG strands used have a molecular weight of around 5 kDa . ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02044 ACS Nano 2017 , 11 , 6085 − 6101 6086 solid lipid core matrix . 15 Unlike liposomes and lipid NPs , the alkyl groups of our alkyl - PEG - AuNPs are exposed to the aqueous environment , tagged to the distal ends of the PEG strands that are densely tethered onto the surface of AuNPs . The AuNP core allows for measurement of their intracellular quantities by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP - MS ) as well as visualization of their intracellular distribution by dark - ﬁ eld microscopy 16 and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . 17 As serum proteins in the cell culture medium can bind to alkyl groups , 18 , 19 the plasmonic properties of AuNPs can empower us to address the possibility of serum - induced aggregation or agglomeration of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs by UV − vis spectrophotometry and dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) , and how such aggregation or agglomeration may in ﬂ uence intracellular delivery . Next , the dense PEG shell surrounding the AuNP cores , at a density of 2 − 3 PEG molecules per nm 2 of AuNP surface , serves two purposes , stability and benchmarking . Whereas many types of emergent bionanomaterials ( such as spherical nucleic acids or lipid NPs ) can e ﬀ ectively enter mammalian cells , they often face premature disassembly or degradation inside the cell . 20 , 21 Here , we will show that the dense PEG shell endows the AuNP core with intracellular stability ( in the cytosol and intracellular compart - ments ) for up to 24 h of incubation , a desirable feature yet unavailable in many conventional NP - based delivery systems . It is also imperative to note that densely PEGylated NPs do not typically enter mammalian cells at high amounts . 22 − 24 Chan and co - workers previously proved that AuNPs decorated by a dense shell of PEG strands of 5 kDa in molecular weight at a density higher than ∼ 1 PEG strand per nm 2 of the AuNP surface can signi ﬁ cantly curb adsorption by serum proteins and reduce serum - induced uptake by macrophages . 23 Likewise , Parak and co - workers reported that inorganic NPs coated by 10 kDa - PEG molecules exhibit a drastically attenuated ability to bind to serum proteins and enter ﬁ broblasts . 24 Therefore , conjugation of alkyl groups to the dense PEG shell can permit us to objectively assess any enhancement in cellular uptake due to alkylation . In this connection , we also will select AuNPs coated by 5 kDa methoxy - terminated PEG strands ( denoted “ methoxy - PEG - AuNPs ” ) as our “ benchmark ” NPs against the alkyl - PEG - AuNPs . To ascertain the e ﬀ ect of alkylation , we will evaluate how two important parameters , ( 1 ) loading density of alkyl groups on the dense PEG shell and ( 2 ) carbon chain length of the alkyl groups , collectively dictate the internalization of NPs by Kera - 308 cells ( mouse keratinocytes ) . In this study , we covalently attached hexyl ( n = 6 ) , dodecyl ( n = 12 ) , or octadecyl ( n = 18 ) groups to the dense PEG shells and at di ﬀ erent loading densities . Note that the key ingredients of conventional alkyl - containing NPs [ e . g . , distearoylphosphatidyl - choline ( DSPC ) , 1 , 2 - distearoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanol - amine ( DSPE ) , and cholesterol ; see Table S1 ] bear alkyl chains of 6 − 20 carbon atoms long . We demonstrate that incorporation of a modest alkyl mass percentage of 0 . 2 % in the dense PEG shell can lead to a 30 - fold increase in the uptake of densely PEGylated AuNPs by Kera - 308 cells after 24 h of incubation . We further interrogate the endocytosis pathway of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs by Kera - 308 cells and mapped their route of intracellular tra ﬃ cking . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Preparation and Characterization of Alkyl - Termi - nated , Densely PEGylated AuNPs . Initially , we synthesized thiol - and alkyl - terminated PEG strands ( HS - PEG - C n H 2 n + 1 ) by covalently conjugating alkylamine ( H 2 N - C n H 2 n + 1 ) of various carbon chain lengths ( n ) to a commercially available thiol - and carboxy - terminated bifunctional PEG linker strand ( HS - PEG - COOH ) via 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - ( dimethylamino ) propyl ) - carbodii - mide / N - hydroxysuccinimide ( EDS / NHS ) chemistry ( Figure 1A ) . By literature precedent , NPs containing positively charged functional groups ( e . g . , lysine - coated micelles or amine - coated quantum dots ) 25 , 26 may nonspeci ﬁ cally enter cells more pronouncedly than their negatively charged or neutrally charged counterparts . 27 To prevent the presence of free unreacted alkylamines associated with our alkyl - PEG - AuNPs from interfering with the cellular uptake data , we extensively puri ﬁ ed the HS - PEG - C n H 2 n + 1 product by solvent extraction and dialysis , followed by performing the ninhydrin test to con ﬁ rm the removal of almost 98 % of the free alkylamines which was initially introduced to the reaction mixture ( Figure S1B ) . To deposit the PEG coating onto the surface of AuNPs to form alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs via gold - sulfur linkages , we next added a mixture of x mol % of HS - PEG - alkyl and ( 100 − x ) mol % of HS - PEG - OCH 3 to an aqueous suspension of citrate - capped AuNPs of 25 nm in diameter ( Figure 1B ) . Based on previous studies , the ratio of two types of thiolated ligands in the reaction mixture corresponds to the display ratio of the ligands on the AuNP surface . 28 , 29 We therefore assume that the display ratio of the methoxy - PEG and alkyl - PEG strands will correspond to the mole ratio of the two PEG types initially added to the AuNP solution . In this connection , we carefully controlled the mole ratio of alkyl - PEG - SH to methoxy - PEG - SH added from 0 mol % ( only methoxy - PEG - SH added without alkyl - PEG - SH ) to 100 mol % ( only alkyl - PEG - SH added without methoxy - PEG - SH ) . After 1 h of PEGylation , we rinsed o ﬀ the excess PEG strands by several rounds of centrifugation and resuspended the resultant methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs in deionized water . To start with , we measured the UV − vis absorbance of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs , hexyl x % - PEG - AuNPs , dodecyl x % - PEG - AuNPs , and octadecyl x % - PEG - AuNPs in water ( Figure 1 C − F and Table S2 ) . In general , attachment of methoxy - terminated PEG strands to AuNPs led to a redshift in the surface plasmon reasonance ( SPR ) peak from 522 to 525 nm in water . For hexyl x % - PEG - AuNPs , their SPR peaks are at 524 − 525 nm in water for most hexyl contents considered . The only exception is hexyl 100 % - PEG - AuNPs ( i . e . , with all PEG strands containing a hexyl group ) , whose SPR Table 1 .

For dodecyl x % - PEG - AuNPs , their peaks are at 524 − 525 nm for the majority of dodecyl contents considered except for dodecyl 100 % - PEG - AuNPs ( i . e . , with all PEG strands containing a dodecyl chain ) , whose SPR peak lies at 529 nm . For most octadecyl contents considered , the SPR peaks of octadecyl x % - PEG - AuNPs are at 522 − 523 nm . Notable exceptions include octadecyl 10 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadec - yl 100 % - PEG - AuNPs , whose SPR peaks reveal obvious broad - ening and redshift to 530 and 532 nm , respectively . Besides UV − vis spectrometry , we next utilized DLS to characterize the same collection of alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs in water ( Table 1 ) . Engraftment of methoxy - PEG - SH strands to the surface of citrate - capped AuNPs increases the overall hydrodynamic diameter from 24 . 9 to 45 . 9 nm , which implies a thickness of roughly 10 nm for the PEG coating in agreement with previous studies . 30 For all values of x considered , the hydrodynamic diameter of hexyl x % - PEG - AuNPs is 43 − 45 nm , a size similar to that of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs . For dodecyl x % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl x % - PEG - AuNPs , their hydrodynamic sizes are similar to that of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs for x < 10 % . On the contrary , the hydrodynamic sizes of dodecyl 100 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 100 % - PEG - AuNPs increase to 59 and 112 nm , respectively , when all PEG chains contain alkyl chains . Taken together , these UV − vis and DLS results underscore colloidal instability of dodecyl x % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl x % - PEG - AuNPs in water for x = 10 or above , possibly due to strong interparticle hydrophobic interactions . 31 The log P values ( where P refers to the octanol / water partition coe ﬃ cient ) of hexane , dodecane , and octadecane are estimated to be 3 . 66 , 6 . 99 , and 9 . 00 , respectively , indicating that these alkyl groups are hydrophobic . At this point , we performed additional physicochemical characterization studies of alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs only , noting their higher stability in water than alkyl 10 % - PEG - AuNPs and alkyl 100 % - PEG - AuNPs . We con ﬁ rmed the presence of the PEG shell by negatively staining the methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs with phosphotungstic acid . By TEM imaging , we observed a homogeneous layer of PEG coating ( negatively stained by phosphotungstic acid ) on the surface of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs of around 4 . 5 nm in thickness irrespective of carbon chain length ( Figure 1C − F , inset ) , a result consistent with previous reports on methoxy - PEG 5000 - coated AuNPs . 32 , 33 Negative staining by uranyl acetate reveals a PEG layer of around 2 . 5 nm in thickness on the surface of AuNPs ( Figure S2 ) . Moreover , we determined the ζ - potential of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs by DLS ( Tables 2 and S3 and Figures S3 and S4 ) . Attachment of methoxy - PEG strands to the surface of citrate - capped AuNPs led to an increase in ζ - potential from − 33 mV to − 16 mV , an observation consistent with the notion of charge screening . 30 For alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs , their ζ - potentials are not signi ﬁ cantly di ﬀ erent from that of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs , ranging between − 23 mV and − 17 mV for all carbon chain lengths considered . Furthermore , we quanti ﬁ ed the total number of PEG strands attached to each AuNP by the Ellman ’ s assay . 34 , 35 Each methoxy - PEG - AuNP contains approx - imately 4700 PEG strands , amounting to 2 . 4 strands per nm 2 of AuNP surface . There are roughly 4500 PEG strands per alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNP ( amounting to 2 . 4 strands per nm 2 of AuNP surface ) , regardless of carbon chain length . Note that this PEG loading density is on par with the saturation loading density of 5 kDa PEG molecules on the surface of a 30 nm AuNP ( i . e . , 2 − 3 PEG molecules per nm 2 of AuNP surface ) . 23 , 35 Our TEM , DLS , and Ellman ’ s assay data demonstrate the successful deposition of a dense PEG shell that constitutes methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs of all carbon chain lengths . Chain Length - Dependent Cellular Uptake of Alkyl - PEG - AuNPs . Armed with the collection of alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs , we systemically investigated the combined e ﬀ ects of carbon chain length ( n ) and alkyl chain loading ( x mol % ) on the uptake by Kera - 308 keratinocytes ( Figure 2 ) . Unless speci ﬁ ed , we performed our cellular uptake experiments by incubating cells in Opti - MEM I reduced serum medium ( OptiMEM ) , in order to preliminarily focus our attention on elucidating the e ﬀ ects of n and x mol % on cellular uptake without a signi ﬁ cant e ﬀ ect by serum proteins . With full recognition of the critical role of serum adsorption on the cellular uptake of NPs , 23 , 24 , 36 − 38 we shall defer our examination of the e ﬀ ect of serum on cellular uptake to later sections of this work ( Figure 4 ) . In view of previous studies that documented the potential cytotoxicity of aliphatic hydrocarbons 39 and carbon - based nanomaterials 40 ( e . g . , single - walled carbon nano - tubes , multiwalled carbon nanotubes , and fullerenes ) , 41 − 43 we ﬁ rst evaluated the cytotoxicity of our alkyl - PEG - AuNPs in Kera - 308 cells ( Figure S5 ) . By the alamarBlue assay , the alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs display high biocompatibility across all carbon chain lengths and loading contents of alkyl groups considered . Live / dead staining of the cells treated with alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs further supports that the cells remain largely viable after 24 h of incubation , irrespective of carbon chain length . We sub - sequently conducted the cellular uptake studies by incubating Kera - 308 cells with 1 nM methoxy - PEG - AuNPs or alkyl x % - Table 2 .

We selected 1 nM rather than exceedingly low NP concentrations ( in the pM range ) in order to more readily identify the internalized AuNPs inside the cells by TEM imaging . 44 We also did not choose exceedingly high NP concentrations ( in the μ M range ) , because higher concentrations of AuNPs may induce cytotoxicity to Figure 2 . Cellular uptake of alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs of varying alkyl chain lengths and alkyl amounts . The incubation time and concentration were 24 h and 1 nM , respectively . ( A ) Kera - 308 cells ( mouse keratinocytes ) were incubated with either methoxy - PEG - AuNPs or alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs containing 1 % , 1 . 3 % , 2 % , 4 % , 10 % , and 100 % ( all in terms of mol % ) hexyl , dodecyl , or octadecyl groups in the dense PEG coating . By ICP - MS measurements , cellular association of NPs increases drastically with carbon chain length and alkyl amounts , with dodecyl - and octadecyl - terminated PEG - AuNPs outperforming methoxy - and hexyl - terminated PEG - AuNPs .

By ICP - MS measurements , we observed in four cell types that dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs exhibit more pronounced cellular uptake than that of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and hexyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs . Data were analyzed by the t test . * * * * p < 0 . 0001 and ns = no signi ﬁ cant di ﬀ erence . ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02044 ACS Nano 2017 , 11 , 6085 − 6101 6089 keratinocytes . 45 After the experiment , we rinsed the treated cells with phosphate - bu ﬀ ered saline ( PBS ) and harvested the cell pellets . Direct inspection of the cell pellets reveals two clear trends in their red color , which stems from the SPR of AuNPs ( Figure S6 ) . On the e ﬀ ect of carbon chain length , the cell pellets resulting from incubation with dodecyl x % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl x % - PEG - AuNPs are substantially more intense in their red color than those resulting from incubation with methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and hexyl x % - PEG - AuNPs . Moreover , the red color becomes more intense with an increasing amount of alkyl groups in the PEG coating , a trend applicable to the cell pellets treated with dodecyl x % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl x % - PEG - AuNPs . These trends highlight that the cellular association of alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs increases with carbon chain length and alkyl loading density . By subsequently analyzing the Au content of the harvested cell pellets by ICP - MS , we observed that methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and hexyl x % - PEG - AuNPs exhibit low levels of association to Kera - 308 cells regardless of alkyl content , both achieving around 5 × 10 3 NPs per cell after 24 h of incubation . By stark contrast , dodecyl x % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl x % - PEG - AuNPs associate with cells more e ﬀ ectively than methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and hexyl x % - PEG - AuNPs . For example , in the presence of low levels of alkyl groups in the PEG coating ( ∼ 1 mol % ) , the cellular association of dodecyl 1 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 1 % - PEG - AuNPs is already 2 - fold and 7 - fold higher than that of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs , respectively . Next , given a medium alkyl loading ( 4 mol % ) , the cellular association of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs amounts to 1 × 10 5 and 1 . 5 × 10 5 NPs per cell , respectively , which are ∼ 20 - fold and 30 - fold higher than that of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs . Incidentally , the cellular association of octadecyl - PEG - AuNPs is consistently higher than that of dodecyl - PEG - AuNPs when we maintained the alkyl content to be below 10 mol % . Finally , when saturated levels of alkyl chains are added to the PEG shell ( 100 mol % ) , the cellular association of both dodecyl 100 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 100 % - PEG - AuNPs amount to 2 . 5 × 10 5 NPs per cell ( ∼ 50 - fold higher than that of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs ) , the most pronounced degree of association ever observed for Kera - 308 cells in our study . Indeed , the pellet of cells incubated with dodecyl 100 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 100 % - PEG - AuNPs ap - pears intensely purple in color , pointing to substantial cellular uptake of aggregated NPs induced by interparticle hydrophobic interactions ( Table 1 and Figure S6 ) . Both the purple - blue color of dodecyl 100 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 100 % - PEG - AuNPs in water ( data not shown ) and the purple color of the cell pellets derived from cells incubated with dodecyl 100 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 100 % - PEG - AuNPs suggest aggrega - tion of the AuNP cores , to the extent that interparticle distance becomes smaller than average AuNP diameter . 46 [ Beyond this point , we deliberately subjected only alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs to further cellular uptake studies . Besides the said requirement for maintaining colloidal stability , the primary objective of this study is to elucidate the e ﬀ ect of alkylation instead of hydrophobicity per se . By incorporating minute amounts of alkyl chains attached to the PEG shell ( i . e . , no more than 4 mol % ) , we anticipated that the alkyl - PEG - AuNPs are hydrophilic , rendering the issue of hydrophobicity on cellular uptake less relevant to this work . To gain some preliminary insights into the hydrophobicity of the alkyl - PEG - AuNPs , we performed an equilibrium partition experiment based on the water / 1 - octanol solvent system , a simple tool for assessing the hydrophobicity of carbon - rich NPs such as fullerenes 47 and multiwalled carbon nanotubes . 48 After 24 h of mixing the NPs in the solvent system , most methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs still remain in the aqueous phase with little transfer to the nonpolar phase ( Figure S7 ) . Whereas this partition assay points to the general hydrophilic nature of our alkyl - PEG - AuNPs , more sophisticated measurements ( e . g . , dynamic interfacial tension ) are necessary to o ﬀ er more precise characterization of the hydrophobicity of the NPs . 49 ] We further con ﬁ rmed the internalization of alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs by Kera - 308 cells by imaging . To start with , we used dark - ﬁ eld microscopy to image the NP - treated Kera - 308 cells after 24 h of incubation ( Figure 2B ) . Consistent with the ICP - MS data , our dark - ﬁ eld images capture intense reddish scattered light ( an indicator of substantial cellular uptake ) 16 from the cells treated with dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs . On the contrary , we could not detect signi ﬁ cant dark - ﬁ eld scattered light from the cells treated with methoxy - PEG - AuNPs or hexyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs . Next , we performed TEM imaging to monitor the subcellular localization of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs inside Kera - 308 cells ( Figure 2C ) . After 24 h of incubation , most dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs accumulate inside intracellular com - partments , whereas methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and hexyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs are rarely found inside the cell . These TEM images corroborate with our ICP - MS analysis and dark - ﬁ eld images , underscoring the e ﬀ ect of carbon chain number on the endocytosis of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs . Finally , we addressed the generalizability of our cellular uptake data in cell types besides Kera - 308 cells . To this end , we incubated three additional types of mammalian cells , including RAW 264 . 7 ( macrophage ) , HeLa ( epithelial ) , and C166 ( endothelial ) cells with 1 nM alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs for 24 h ( Figure 2D ) . For these four cell types , we proved by ICP - MS analysis that dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs exhibit more signi ﬁ cant cellular uptake than methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and hexyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs . For instance , the cellular association of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs with C166 cells is 1 . 0 × 10 5 NPs per cell and 3 . 5 × 10 5 NPs per cell , respectively , almost 30 - fold and 100 - fold higher than that of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and hexyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs ( ∼ 3 . 5 × 10 3 NPs per cell ) , respectively . On average , the cellular association of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs to each C166 and HeLa cell is up to 3 - fold and 9 - fold higher than that of each RAW 264 . 7 and Kera - 308 cell , respectively . On a per cell surface area basis , however , the number of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadec - yl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs associated with all four cell types is actually comparable because RAW 264 . 7 and Kera - 308 cells are noticeably smaller than C166 and HeLa cells ( Figure S8 ) . These data further rea ﬃ rm that carbon chain length of the alkyl chains is a critically important parameter for the cellular uptake of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs . In summary , alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs enter the cell e ﬀ ectively when ( 1 ) the carbon chain length of alkyl chains is at least 12 and ( 2 ) the fraction of alkyl chains in the PEG shell is more than 1 mol % . Alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs with higher alkyl contents can enter cells more signi ﬁ cantly , yet su ﬀ er from colloidal instability possibly due to interparticle aggregation . Note that our imaging data reveal clear abundance of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs inside the cell . Four mol % of dodecyl - PEG and octadecyl - PEG strands tethered on the AuNP translates to a mass percentage of only 0 . 14 % for dodecyl groups and 0 . 20 % for octadecyl groups in the dense PEG shell , respectively ( Table S4 ) . Remarkably , such a modest ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02044 ACS Nano 2017 , 11 , 6085 − 6101 6090 alkyl mass percentage of 0 . 2 % is 2 orders of magnitude lower that of conventional lipid - based NPs , like liposomes for drug delivery , lipid NPs for gene delivery , and phospholipid - coated quantum dots for imaging ( Tables S1 ) . 1 , 4 , 50 In view of the widely acknowledged di ﬃ culty for densely PEGylated NPs to enter mammalian cells , our data accentuate the promise of incorporating minute amounts of alkyl groups ( ≤ 0 . 2 mass percent ) as a viable strategy for boosting the intracellular delivery of NPs . Cellular Uptake Kinetics of Alkyl - PEG - AuNPs . To investigate the cellular uptake kinetics of alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs , we incubated Kera - 308 cells with 1 nM methoxy - PEG - AuNPs or alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs for di ﬀ erent durations of time , followed by harvesting the cell pellets for ICP - MS measurements ( Figure 3A ) . Methoxy - PEG - AuNPs do not exhibit any appreciable increase in cellular association over the 24 - h observation time window , with their intracellular Au content hitting an equilibrium value of 3 × 10 3 NPs per cell after only 15 min of incubation . The cellular uptake of hexyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs narrowly increases over time , reaching 6 × 10 3 NPs per cell ( or 2 - fold higher than methoxy - PEG - AuNPs ) after 24 h of incubation . On the contrary , the cellular uptake kinetics of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs are much more rapid than those of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and hexyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs , netting Au contents of 4 − 5 times higher than that of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs ( i . e . , 1 . 2 − 1 . 5 × 10 4 NPs per cell ) after 15 min of incubation . Strikingly , after 24 h of incubation , the intracellular Au contents of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs become 9 × 10 4 NPs per cell ( i . e . , 30 - fold higher than methoxy - PEG - AuNPs ) and 1 . 2 × 10 5 NPs per cell ( i . e . , 40 - fold higher than methoxy - PEG - AuNPs ) , respectively . Note that the amount of octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs internalized by Kera - 308 cells consistently leads that of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs over the 24 h observation time window . To visualize the cellular uptake kinetics of alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs , we prepared a collection of alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs that contains a tiny portion of PEG strands tagged with a Cyanine 5 ( Cy5 ) molecule at their distal ends for confocal imaging . These Cy5 - labeled , alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs contain merely su ﬃ cient amounts of Cy5 molecules ( ∼ 0 . 13 mol % ) in the PEG shell to facilitate confocal imaging , but not excessive amounts that would severely modify the surface functionality of the alkyl - PEG - AuNPs . To this end , we introduced varying ratios of methoxy - PEG - SH , alkyl - PEG - SH , and Cy5 - PEG - SH strands to an aqueous suspension of 25 nm citrate - capped AuNPs and allowed the reaction to proceed for 1 h ( Figure S9A ) . We con ﬁ rmed by DLS analysis that introduction of Cy5 molecules to the PEG coating does not drastically change the hydro - dynamic size in OptiMEM and ζ - potential of alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs ( Figure S9C ) . Next , we performed three control experiments to exclude the role of Cy5 in cellular uptake . In the ﬁ rst experiment , we incubated Kera - 308 cells with Cy5 - labeled , methoxy - PEG - AuNPs for 24 h , followed by detecting the intracellular Cy5 ﬂ uorescence by confocal imaging . Our confocal images do not reveal detectable amounts of Cy5 - labeled methoxy - PEG - AuNPs inside the cell ( Figure S9B ) . These data verify that , contrary to alkyl groups , incorporation of Cy5 molecules to the dense PEG coating does not signi ﬁ cantly promote cellular entry . In the second experiment , we incubated Kera - 308 cells with Cy5 - labeled , dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs . In this case , we observed intense intracellular Cy5 ﬂ uorescence signals due to the e ﬃ cient cellular entry of Cy5 - labeled , dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs . In agreement with the data presented in Figure 2 , the intracellular Cy5 ﬂ uorescence signals intensify with increasing amounts of Cy5 in the dense PEG coating . In the third experiment , we added methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs , with and without Cy5 modi ﬁ cation , to Kera - 308 cells for 3 and 24 h . By ICP - MS measurements , we con ﬁ rmed that Cy5 modi ﬁ cation does not alter the cellular uptake kinetics of the NPs ( Figure S9D ) . Ultimately , we returned to our original confocal imaging studies on the cellular uptake kinetics of Cy5 - labeled , alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs of Kera - 308 cells . We observed a gradual increase in Figure 3 . Cellular uptake kinetics of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs . ( A ) By ICP - MS measurements , dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs rapidly associate with Kera - 308 cells after 0 . 25 h of incubation . After 24 h of incubation , their cellular association was 30 - fold and 40 - fold higher than that of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs , respectively . Error bars denote standard deviations resulting from triplicate experiments . ( B ) Kera - 308 cells were incubated with Cy5 - tagged alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs for di ﬀ erent durations of time . By confocal imaging , we observed gradual increase in intracellular Cy5 ﬂ uorescence in cells treated with dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs . By contrast , we could not detect appreciable intracellular Cy5 ﬂ uorescence after incubating the cells with Cy5 - labeled hexyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs for 24 h . ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02044 ACS Nano 2017 , 11 , 6085 − 6101 6091 Cy5 ﬂ uorescence signals in cells treated with dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs over the entire 24 h observation window ( Figure 3B ) . By contrast , we could not detect appreciable intracellular Cy5 ﬂ uorescence signals after incubating the cells with Cy5 - labeled , hexyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs , in close agreement with our dark - ﬁ eld imaging data presented in Figure 2 . In brief , our ICP - MS and confocal imaging data demonstrate that dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs can enter Kera - 308 cells at markedly higher rates and in larger amounts than methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and hexyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs , reinforcing the pivotal role of alkyl chain length on cellular uptake kinetics . E ﬀ ect of Serum on the Cellular Uptake of Alkyl - PEG - AuNPs . At the NP level , we have established that alkyl chain number and loading density of alkyl chains dictate the cellular uptake of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs . We next questioned , at the cell culture medium level , whether serum would also in ﬂ uence cellular uptake , because serum proteins may adsorb onto the surface of NPs and alter their cellular uptake proper - ties . 23 , 24 , 36 − 38 To this end , we incubated alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs in a medium containing di ﬀ erent concentrations of serum proteins , including water , PBS , DMEM without fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , OptiMEM , and DMEM with 10 % FBS ( the complete medium for culturing Kera - 308 cells ) at 37 ° C . We ascertained a priori , by the bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) protein assay , that the concentration of proteins in OptiMEM is equivalent to that of 1 % FBS . After 24 h of incubation , we characterized the physicochemical properties of the NPs and correlated these properties to the cellular uptake of the NPs by Kera - 308 cells . For our characterization studies , we performed DLS measurements of the NPs after incubation in di ﬀ erent types of medium ( Tables 3 and Table S5 and Figures S10 − S13 ) . At all serum concentrations up to 10 % FBS , the hydrodynamic diameters of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and hexyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs constantly hover in the range of 43 − 49 nm , in agreement to our earlier DLS data presented in Table 2 . For dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs , their sizes in nonserum containing media ( i . e . , water , PBS , and DMEM without FBS ) are typically around 45 nm ; yet , the NPs become progressively larger upon incubation in a medium with increasing serum contents , from 84 nm in OptiMEM to 127 nm in DMEM with 10 % FBS . For octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs , their sizes in OptiMEM , DMEM without FBS , and DMEM with 10 % FBS are 165 , 108 , and 576 nm , respectively . Taken together , our DLS results appear to highlight severe serum - induced aggregation of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs . Paradoxically , the UV − vis spectra of these alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNP samples reveal one single SPR peak without redshifting nor broadening when the NPs are incubated in all types of medium considered ( Figures 4A and S14A , B ) . This observation fundamentally di ﬀ ers from the broadened absorption spectrum of the aggregated NPs after being exposed to protein - containing medium reported in other Table 3 .

E ﬀ ect of serum on the cellular uptake of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs . ( A ) UV − vis spectra of methoxy - PEG - AuNPs and alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs incubated in PBS , OptiMEM , DMEM without FBS , or DMEM with 10 % FBS at 37 ° C for 24 h show a single peak without signi ﬁ cant red - shift of the surface plasmon resonance peak of the AuNPs , supporting the lack of obvious NP aggregation across the 24 h incubation time window . ( B ) Kera - 308 cells were incubated with 1 nM methoxy - PEG - AuNPs or alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs in OptiMEM , DMEM without FBS , or DMEM with 10 % FBS for 24 h . By ICP - MS analysis , incubation in DMEM with 10 % FBS led to 80 % and 60 % reduction in the cellular association of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs when compared to the case of incubation in OptiMEM . Error bars denote standard deviations resulting from triplicate experiments . ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02044 ACS Nano 2017 , 11 , 6085 − 6101 6092 studies . 51 − 54 Additionally , the solutions of alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs in all types of medium remain red in color after 24 h of incubation , accompanied by the lack of large visible aggregates of NPs sedimenting to the bottom of the reaction vessels ( Figure S14C ) . These UV − vis data and colorimetric observations suggest no obvious aggregation between the adjacent NPs in all types of medium considered . The red color indicates that the interparticle distance between the AuNP cores is far greater than the average AuNP diameter . 46 Thus , we envision that the increase in hydrodynamic diameter of alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs upon incubation in serum re ﬂ ects agglomeration of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs 51 rather than irreversible aggregation of the AuNP cores , 36 , 52 a point later proven by TEM imaging in our intracellular tra ﬃ cking studies ( Figure 6 ) . As such , the dense PEG shells of the NPs only touch one another , whereas the NP cores are not in physical contact . Previously , Spector showed that fatty acids that contain 18 carbons can associate with albumin , the most abundant protein in serum , with 8 - fold and 5000 - fold higher a ﬃ nity than those fatty acids containing 12 and 6 carbons , respectively . 18 Wolfrum et al . reported that siRNAs conjugated to alkyl chains with 12 carbon atoms ( lauryl ) and 18 carbon atoms ( stearyl ) can also bind to albumin . 19 Given that the average size of a methoxy - PEG - AuNP is around 45 nm , we believe that the hexyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs exist as monodisperse NPs in OptiMEM . By estimation , dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs manifest themselves as a loose agglomerated cluster of 2 − 3 NPs and 4 − 6 NPs in OptiMEM , respectively . In summary , alkyl - PEG - AuNPs can form loose NP clusters in serum - containing cell culture medium , and the degree of agglomeration increases Figure 5 . Pathway for the uptake of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs by Kera - 308 cells . ( A ) Representative TEM images depict the initial contact of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs with the cell membrane within the ﬁ rst 0 . 5 h of incubation . ( i − ii ) Note the two modes of involvement by the ﬁ lopodium layer , tip engagement ( red arrow ) and formation of invaginations between adjacent ﬁ lopodia ( asterisks ) . ( iii ) The “ crisscrossing ” of protrusions in these hot spots triggers the formation of invaginations that facilitate the cellular entry of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and ( iv ) accumulation inside intracellular compartments . The bottom row shows the enlargement of the boxed area in their top row . ( Legend : Nu = nucleus ; Cy = cytosol ; and Ex = extracellular space . ) ( B ) Upon pretreatment of Kera - 308 cells with dynasore and methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( m - β CD ) , the intracellular ﬂ uorescence signal of Cy5 - labeled , dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs signi ﬁ cantly plunges . The cell pellets reveal reduced cellular uptake after dynasore and m - β CD treatment , as seen by the diminished red color due to the surface plasmon resonance of AuNPs . ( C ) By ICP - MS measurements , pretreatment with dynasore or m - β CD and placement of cells at 4 ° C suppress the association of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs with Kera - 308 cells by over 60 % . ( D ) By ICP - MS measurements , RNAi - mediated genetic knockdown of caveolin - 1 ( Cav - 1 ) , clathrin heavy chain 1 ( Clhc - 1 ) , and dynamin - 2 ( Dnm - 2 ) does not severely attenuate the association of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs to Kera - 308 cells . Error bars denote standard deviations resulting from triplicate experiments . ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02044 ACS Nano 2017 , 11 , 6085 − 6101 6093 with carbon chain length and serum concentration . Notably , due to their dense PEG shell , these alkyl - PEG - AuNPs still maintain considerable colloidal stability as their cores do not aggregate after prolonged incubation for 24 h in serum - containing medium . For most cellular uptake experiments in this study , we opted for the use of OptiMEM as the incubation medium , because it allows us to investigate the cellular uptake of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs without signi ﬁ cantly impacted by serum while maintaining the health of the cells over an incubation time of 24 h . After clarifying the e ﬀ ect of serum on NP agglomeration , we turned to investigate how the cellular uptake of alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs depends on serum concentration . We incubated Kera - 308 cells with 1 nM alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs in OptiMEM , DMEM without FBS , or DMEM with 10 % FBS for 24 h ( Figure 4B ) . By ICP - MS analysis , we found that cellular uptake in OptiMEM is similar to that in DMEM without serum , with the latter incubation condition being around 15 % lower ( 12 × 10 4 NPs per cell versus 10 × 10 4 NPs per cell for dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and 15 × 10 4 NPs per cell versus 13 × 10 4 NPs per cell for octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs ) . Note that this observation applies to all carbon chain lengths considered . The slightly attenuated cellular uptake in DMEM without serum may arise from prolonged serum starvation of the treated cells . 55 More importantly , even in the absence of serum ( DMEM without FBS ) , dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs still enter Kera - 308 cells more pronouncedly than methoxy - PEG - AuNPs or hexyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs , driving home the point that the cellular uptake of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs does not require the aid of serum proteins . While our DLS and UV − vis data suggest mild serum - induced agglomeration of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs in OptiMEM , the ICP - MS data demonstrate that their cellular entry does not signi ﬁ cantly depend upon serum adsorption when serum concentration is 1 % . However , higher amounts of serum ( i . e . , DMEM with 10 % FBS ) cause sharp attenuation in the cellular uptake of the same collection of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs . When compared to the OptiMEM case , the cellular uptake of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs and octadecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs in DMEM with 10 % FBS decreases by nearly 80 % and 60 % , respectively . By literature precedent , we speculate two possible explanations to the drastically reduced uptake of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs in the presence of higher amounts of serum ( 10 % FBS ) : ( 1 ) NPs or NP clusters larger than 100 nm generally enter nonmacrophage cells less e ﬀ ectively than their smaller counterparts ; 56 − 58 and ( 2 ) serum adsorption reduces the ability of NPs to adhere to the cell membrane or interact with membrane receptors for their subsequent entry to the cell . 36 , 59 Interestingly , despite the overall decline in the cellular uptake of alkyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs in DMEM with 10 % FBS , our ICP - MS data shows that the degree of cellular uptake increases with alkyl chain number , a trend similar to that observed for the cases of OptiMEM and DMEM without serum . In conclusion , the cellular uptake of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs does not necessitate the involvement of serum protein , although it markedly decreases at higher serum concentrations . With or without serum , cellular uptake increases with the carbon chain number of the alkyl groups . Pathway for the Cellular Uptake of Alkyl - PEG - AuNPs . We further elucidated the mechanism for the cellular uptake of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs at the pathway level . We selected dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs as our representative alkyl - PEG - AuNP because they exhibit an optimal balance between cellular uptake and colloidal stability in OptiMEM among our collection of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs ( Figure 2 and Table 3 ) . To begin with , we investigated the ultrastructural details of the endocytosis process by capturing the initial contact of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs with the cell membrane of Kera - 308 cells within the ﬁ rst 2 h of incubation by TEM imaging . Representative TEM images of the extracellular region depict the abundance of individual NP cores that resemble colloidally stable PEGylated NPs 60 − 62 rather than aggregated NP cores , 52 , 60 , 63 indicating that the alkyl - PEG - NPs primarily enter Kera - 308 cells as individual entities instead of aggregated clusters . This observation supports our hypothesis that the alkyl - PEG - AuNPs remain loosely interconnected in serum - containing medium ( Figures 5A and S6 ) and underscores the merit of incorporating a low mass percentage of alkyl groups to the dense PEG shell to achieve e ﬀ ective intracellular delivery and to maintain colloidal stability in the extracellular region . These TEM images repeatedly depict association of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs with ﬁ nger - like cell membrane protrusions of 60 − 200 nm in diameter , matching past literature reports on the length characteristic of ﬁ lopoida 64 ( Figures 5A and S15 ) . Found in many di ﬀ erent cell types , ( e . g . , keratinocytes , neurons , endothelial cells and invasive cancer cells ) , ﬁ lopodia are highly dynamic cellular protrusions that constantly probe the extracellular environment for controlling cell adhesion and migration . 64 , 65 Association of NPs with the ﬁ lopodia manifests in two distinct modes : ( 1 ) engagement by the tip of membrane protrusions and ( 2 ) accumulation in the “ interdigital folds ” on the cell membrane ( i . e . , space between adjacent membrane protrusions ) . These observations support a ﬁ lopodia - dependent pathway of endocytosis , whereby biological objects ( e . g . , exosome and virus ) are grabbed by the protrusions and then pulled toward the “ endocytic hot spots ” located in the ﬁ lopodia base . 66 , 67 “ Crisscrossing ” of protrusions in these hot spots triggers the formation of invaginations that facilitate the cellular entry of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs and accumulation inside intracellular compartments ( Figure 5A ) . We also con ﬁ rmed the abundance of ﬁ lopodia by TEM imaging in untreated Kera - 308 cells , illustrating that the presence of ﬁ lopodia is not a consequence of NP incubation ( Figure S16 ) . The above TEM imaging data appear to reveal the dearth of honeycomb - shaped lattices that resemble clathrin - like struc - tures 68 or ﬂ ask - shaped invaginations that resemble caveolae 69 in close proximity to the cell membrane . We further used a combination of pharmacological inhibition and genetic knock - down approaches to address whether the internalization of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs by Kera - 308 cells is clathrin - dependent or lipid raft / caveolae - dependent . In one set of studies , we asked whether pretreatment of Kera - 308 cells with a series of pharmacological inhibitors of key pathways may adversely a ﬀ ect the cellular uptake of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs ( Figure S17A ) . We con ﬁ rmed in advance that incubation of Kera - 308 cells with these inhibitors for 6 h does not substantially reduce their viability ( Figure S17B ) . As our ﬁ rst inhibitor , we pretreated Kera - 308 cells with methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( m - β CD ) , a widely used inhibitor that alters the structure of cholesterol - rich domains in the cell membrane , 70 before adding dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs to the cells . By confocal imaging , pretreatment with m - β CD drastically attenuated the cellular uptake of Cy5 - labeled , dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs , as seen by the signi ﬁ cant reduction in the intracellular Cy5 ﬂ uorescence signals ( Figure 5B ) . While we also detected by ICP - MS analysis a 95 % decrease in the cellular association of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs following pretreatment with m - β CD ( Figure 5C ) , ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02044 ACS Nano 2017 , 11 , 6085 − 6101 6094 we could not conclusively pinpoint the involvement of a speci ﬁ c pathway of endocytosis . Not only does m - β CD nonspeci ﬁ cally inhibit lipid raft or caveolae - mediated uptake , 71 it also blocks clathrin - mediated 71 , 72 uptake and ﬂ uid - phase Figure 6 . Intracellular tra ﬃ cking of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs . Kera - 308 cells were incubated with Cy5 - labeled , dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs for confocal imaging or dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs for TEM imaging . ( A ) By confocal imaging , the ﬂ uorescence signals of NPs ( red ) do not colocalize with those of intracellular acidic compartments ( LysoTracker Green DND - 26 ; green ) after 2 h of incubation . After 10 and 24 h of incubation , the Cy5 ﬂ uorescence signals substantially colocalize with the those of LysoTracker ( yellow ) with a Mander ’ s coe ﬃ cient of 0 . 8 ( bottom - left corner of pictures ) . 18 , 95 ( B ) After 2 h of incubation , representative TEM images show the accumulation of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs inside vesicles of around 200 nm in diameter ( red arrows ) or the cytosol ( blue arrows ) . After 10 h of incubation , most NPs accumulate in late endosome , as evidenced by the presence of multivesicular bodies of ∼ 100 nm in diameter ( MVBs ; red arrows ) . After 24 h of incubation , most NPs localize in the lysosome , which are characterized by the presence of multilamellar bodies ( MLBs ; red arrows ) and its high electron density . ( C ) Representative TEM images capture the localization of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs in the cytosol ( blue arrows ) of Kera - 308 cells consistently after 2 , 10 , and 24 h of incubation . The lower images show the enlargement of the boxed areas on the upper panels . ( Legend : Nu = nucleus ; Cy = cytosol ; and Ex = extracellular space . ) ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02044 ACS Nano 2017 , 11 , 6085 − 6101 6095 endocytosis . 73 Further complicating our analysis , the decrease in cellular uptake may arise from the interaction between m - β CD and dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs besides the customary role of m - β CD in depleting the cholesterol in the cell membrane , because m - β CD can bind to alkyl - containing molecules . 74 Moving on to other inhibitors , we noticed that pretreatment of Kera - 308 cells with chlorpromazine ( a relatively speci ﬁ c inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ) 68 , 75 or ﬁ lipin III ( a relatively speci ﬁ c inhibitor of lipid raft / caveolae - meidated endocytosis ) 68 , 76 does not appreciably interfere with the cellular uptake of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs ( Figure 5C ) . In another set of studies , we transfected Kera - 308 cells with siRNA that speci ﬁ cally suppresses the expression of key proteins a ﬃ liated with the canonical cellular uptake pathways such as heavy chain 1 of clathrin ( Clhc - 1 ) and caveolin - 1 ( Cav - 1 ) , followed by measuring the cellular uptake of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs . We con ﬁ rmed the reduction in expression of both proteins after transfection by Western blotting ( Figure S17C ) . In line with our pharmacological inhibition studies , genetic knockdown of Clhc - 1 or Cav - 1 failed to attenuate the association of NPs to Kera - 308 cells by a wide margin ( Figure 5D ) . Summing up the TEM imaging , pharmacological inhibition , and genetic knockdown data , we conclude that the uptake of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs by Kera - 308 cells is not primarily clathrin - or caveolae - mediated . Moreover , we pre - treated Kera - 308 cells with amiloride ( an inhibitor of macropinocytosis and phagocytosis ) , 77 , 78 mannan ( a ligand of the phagocytosis - related mannose receptor ) , fucoidan ( a ligand of the phagocytosis - related scavenger receptor ) , 79 or cytocha - lasin D ( which disrupts the polymerization of actin ﬁ laments ) . 68 , 80 As we did not detect a considerable decrease in the cellular uptake of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs following pretreatment by these four inhibitors ( Figure 5C ) , we conclude limited involvement of micropinocytosis and phagocytosis . Furthermore , we inquired the potential relevance of dynamin to the cellular uptake of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs . Since our TEM imaging data show that the dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs NPs enter Kera - 308 cells by interacting extensively with their ﬁ lopodia ( Figure 5A ) , we speculate that dynamin may mediate the uptake of these NPs because dynamin can regulate actin - based cytoskeleton , 81 such as lammellipodia and ﬁ lopodia . 82 , 83 Nevertheless , existing literature on dynamin mostly indicates that dynamin is essential for the formation of membrane invaginations that support clathrin - mediated endocytosis , 84 , 85 a pathway with little involvement in the internalization of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs by Kera - 308 cells . Therefore , we used both pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdown approaches to interrogate the role of dynamin . We selected dynasore , a frequently used inhibitor to probe the relevance of the dynamin - mediated pathway to the cellular uptake of many biomolecules 80 and NPs . 81 Notably , by confocal imaging and ICP - MS analysis , pretreatment with dynasore led to a sharp 72 % decline in the cellular uptake of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs ( Figure 5B , C ) , a result that purportedly supports the notion of dynamin - mediated uptake . Nonetheless , dynasore has become a debatable inhibitor of dynamin in recent years , plagued by its frequently reported o ﬀ - target e ﬀ ects . 86 For example , Camilli and co - workers found that in dynamin - knockout ﬁ broblasts , dynasore can inhibit dynamin - mediated endocytosis and nonspeci ﬁ cally impair ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis and peripheral membrane ru ﬄ ing ﬂ uid - phase . 87 In view of these recently reported o ﬀ - target e ﬀ ects of dynasore on cellular cholesterol , lipid raft , and actin , 86 we further employed RNA interference to suppress the expression of dynamin - 2 ( Dnm - 2 ) , a key constituent protein of dynamin . Dnm - 2 is ubiquitously expressed in most cell types , whereas dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 3 are speci ﬁ cally expressed in neurons . 85 Surprisingly , we observed only 12 % reduction in the cellular uptake of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs upon genetic inhibition of Dnm - 2 knockdown cells ( Figure 5D ) . By juxtaposing the severe decrease in cellular uptake due to dynasore pretreatment and the modest decrease arising from Dmn - 2 genetic knockdown , we cannot establish a speci ﬁ c role of dynamin in the endocytosis of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs by Kera - 308 cells . Instead , we can only speculate the presence of o ﬀ - target e ﬀ ects associated with dynasore that ultimately interfere with the uptake process . Intracellular Tra ﬃ cking of Alkyl - PEG - AuNPs . Lastly , we examined the intracellular tra ﬃ cking of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs following their initial cellular entry . On one hand , we incubated Kera - 308 cells with Cy5 - labeled , dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs for di ﬀ erent durations of time , followed by staining the cells with LysoTracker , a green ﬂ uorescent dye that stains intracellular acidic compartments like late endosome or lysosome , and visualizing the intracellular distribution of the NPs by confocal microscopy . On the other hand , we performed TEM imaging of the Kera - 308 cells treated with dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs as a function of incubation time . After 2 h of incubation , we detected by confocal imaging that most NPs are located inside the cell without entering acidic compartments ( Figure 6A ) . Representative TEM images reveal that the NPs accumulate inside vesicles of around 200 nm in diameter ( Figure 6B ) . Also , they depict localization of ∼ 14 . 4 % of the NPs in the cytosol ( Figures 6C and S18 ) . After 10 h of incubation , confocal images portray strong overlapping ﬂ uorescence signals of the NPs and LysoTracker with a Manders coe ﬃ cient of 0 . 8 , implying signi ﬁ cant accumulation of dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs inside intracellular acidic compartments . TEM images further depict conspicuous accumulation of NPs inside multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) of ∼ 100 nm in diameter , 20 , 88 hallmark features of the late endosome ( Figure 6B ) . 89 We still identi ﬁ ed considerable accumulation of NPs in the cytosol after 10 h of incubation ( Figure 6C ) . After 24 h of incubation , most dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs accumulate inside intracellular acidic compartments , as evidenced by prominent colocalization of the ﬂ uorescence signals of Cy5 and LysoTracker also with a Manders coe ﬃ cient of 0 . 8 . By TEM imaging , most NPs localize in the lysosome , which are characterized by the presence of multilamellar bodies of around 100 nm to 2 . 4 μ m in diameter ( MLBs ; refer to Figure S19 for untreated Kera - 308 cells ) and its high electron density ( Figure 6B ) . 90 , 91 In line with our 2 h data , 18 . 9 % of the alkyl - PEG - AuNPs still accumulate freely in the cytosol after 24 h of incubation . Of note , these NPs exist as discrete entities inside the cell and show negligible aggregation of the AuNP cores throughout the 24 h observation time window . In fact , we can still appreciate the PEG coating of the NPs ( positively stained by the osmium tetroxide 92 added to the cell samples in preparation for TEM imaging ) in high - magni ﬁ cation TEM images taken from cells after 24 h of incubation ( Figure S20 ) . Thus , our alkyl - PEG - AuNPs are markedly di ﬀ erent from other NP - based delivery systems that can enter cells pronouncedly but aggregate irreversibly inside intracellular compartments . 20 , 60 The PEG shell of our alkyl - PEG - AuNPs probably su ﬀ ers from inappreciable enzymatic degradation , 93 preventing the AuNPs from aggregating inside the cell even after 24 h . In short , alkyl - PEG - AuNPs ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02044 ACS Nano 2017 , 11 , 6085 − 6101 6096 predominantly adopt the conventional “ endo - lysosomal ” tra ﬃ cking route upon cellular entry , leaving ∼ 15 % of them freely accumulating in the cytosol . This degree of cytosolic accumulation is consistent with previous reports on the tra ﬃ cking of PEG - coated AuNPs . Brandenberger et al . observed that ∼ 80 % of the PEG - AuNPs accumulates inside vesicles and 10 − 15 % of them in the cytosol of alveolar epithelial cells , a trend consistently observed after 1 , 4 , and 24 h of incubation . 94 TEM micrographs by Oh and Park captured the migration of PEG - AuNPs in the cytosol of macrophages and their ultimate exocytosis . 60 Therefore , we believe that weak alkylation ( via incorporation of a modest alkyl mass percentage of no more than 0 . 2 % ) does not signi ﬁ cantly bias the previously published intracellular distribution of PEG - AuNPs . CONCLUSIONS In this work , we have systematically investigated the e ﬀ ect of alkylation on the cellular uptake of densely PEGylated AuNPs , which are acknowledged for their limited uptake by mammalian cells . We have demonstrated that inclusion of an extremely modest fraction of alkyl chains to the dense PEG shell ( < 4 % in terms of mole percentage or < 0 . 2 % in terms of mass percentage ) can increase cellular uptake by 10 - fold to 100 - fold depending upon the cell type . The two critically important parameters for cellular uptake are loading density of the alkyl groups and carbon chain number of the alkyl groups . Notably , alkyl - PEG - AuNPs with carbon chain lengths of 12 or longer ( i . e . , dodecyl or octadecyl ) can enter cells more rapidly and abundantly than those NPs containing shorter alkyl chains ( i . e . , hexyl ) . These observations apply at all serum concentrations considered ( even under serum - free conditions ) , although higher levels of serum can cause agglomeration of alkyl - PEG - AuNPs as well as attenuation in cellular uptake . At the pathway level , we have observed that the alkyl - PEG - AuNPs predom - inantly enter Kera - 308 cells via the ﬁ lopodia - mediated pathway , associating with ﬁ nger - like membrane protrusions via tip engagement and accumulation inside interdigital folds . Finally , we have mapped out the route of tra ﬃ cking of alkyl - PEG - NPs inside Kera - 308 cells . Most NPs adopt the “ endo - lysosomal ” tra ﬃ cking route , yet a sizable portion of ∼ 15 % freely accumulates in the cytosol . Regardless of intracellular location , these alkyl - PEG - AuNPs mostly appear as individual entities up to 24 h of incubation . Taken together , our work presents mechanistic insights into how alkylation dictates the cellular uptake of densely PEGylated NPs . These insights , in turn , lay down the rules for engineering NPs for cellular uptake and cytosolic accumulation with intracellular stability . MATERIALS AND METHODS Synthesis of HS - PEG 5000 - alkyl . The carboxyl group of the bifunctional polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) linker , HS - PEG 5000 - COOH ( JenKem Technology ) , was activated by 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - ( dimethylamino ) propyl ) - carbodiimide ( Sigma ) / N - hydroxysuccini - mide ( Sigma ) ( EDC / NHS ) chemistry . Brie ﬂ y , HS - PEG 5000 - COOH ( 0 . 1 μ mol ) , EDC ( 0 . 5 μ mol ) , NHS ( 0 . 5 μ mol ) , and trimethylamine ( 0 . 5 μ mol ) ( TAE ) ( Sigma ) was dissolved in 1 mL of freshly distilled dichloromethane ( DCM ) and vortexed for 2 h . Next , 0 . 5 μ mol of hexylamine ( H 2 N - C 6 H 13 ) ( Sigma ) , dodecylamine ( H 2 N - C 12 H 25 ) ( Sigma ) , or octadecylamine ( H 2 N - C 18 H 37 ) ( Alfa Aesar ) , initially dissolved in 0 . 5 mL of DCM , was added in excess to the 0 . 1 μ mol of activated PEG linker , followed by vortexing overnight . The reaction mixture was added dropwise into cold diethyl ether and then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 3 min . The precipitated PEG product was washed with cold diethyl ether for 5 more times with sonication and brie ﬂ y dried . Finally , the product was dialyzed against methanol for 1 wk , against 0 . 1 % acetic acid in water for 1 d , and against deionized water for 1 more d . Successful conjugation of alkylamine to the bifunctional PEG linker was con ﬁ rmed by matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - ﬂ ight ( MALDI - TOF ) ( Bruker ) . The octanol − water partition coe ﬃ cient ( log P ) values of the alkanes were calculated using the Molinspiration Cheminfomatics open source module for molecular properties and bioactivity score calculation . Preparation of Alkyl - Terminated PEG - Coated NPs . Citrate - capped AuNPs of 25 nm in diameter were prepared by an established seed - mediated growth method . 96 In brief , 150 mL of 2 . 2 mM anhydrous sodium citrate ( Alfa Aesar ) was brought to boil in a three - necked round - bottom ﬂ ask with rapid stirring , followed by injection of 1 mL of 25 mM gold ( III ) chloride trihydrate ( HAuCl 4 · 3H 2 O , Sigma ) . After becoming orange red in about 15 min , the solution was cooled down to 90 ° C and maintained at this temperature . Next , 1 mL of 25 mM Au 3 + was injected twice at 30 min intervals . The solution was diluted by replacing 55 mL of the solution with 53 mL of Nanopure water ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) and 2 mL of 60 mM sodium citrate . Addition of 1 mL of the 25 mM Au 3 + solution was repeated 3 times every 30 min . The solution was used for subsequent NP growth . The process of dilution , addition of sodium citrate solution , and three doses of Au 3 + solution was repeated again until the AuNPs measure roughly 25 nm in diameter , as evidenced by their surface plasmon resonance peak at 521 nm . 97 To prepare alkyl - terminated , PEG - coated AuNPs ( alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs ) for ICP - MS and TEM studies , an aqueous suspension of AuNP solution was mixed with x mol % of HS - PEG 5000 - C n H 2 n + 1 and ( 100 − x ) mol % of HS - PEG 5000 - OCH 3 ( JenKem Technology ) by keeping the total PEG concentration at 20 PEG molecules per nm 2 of AuNP surface to be coated . All PEGylation reactions lasted for 1 h with sonication , followed by puri ﬁ cation by 5 rounds of centrifugation at 13 , 000 rpm for 15 min and resuspension in deionized water . To prepare Cyanine 5 ( Cy5 ) - containing dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs for confocal imaging , 0 . 13 mol % of HS - PEG 5000 - Cy5 ( Nanocs ) , 4 mol % of HS - PEG 5000 - C 12 H 25 , and 94 . 7 % of HS - PEG 5000 - OCH 3 were added to the AuNP solution while keeping the total number of HS - PEG 5000 - dodecyl strands per NP unchanged . Characterization of Alkyl x % - PEG - AuNPs . The concentration of NPs was determined by UV − vis - NIR spectrophotometry ( Agilent Cary 5000 ) based on the Beer − Lambert ’ s law and the molar extinction coe ﬃ cient of AuNPs of 25 nm in diameter ( 1 . 1 × 10 9 M − 1 cm − 1 ) . 97 The hydrodynamic diameters and ζ - potentials of NPs were measured by dynamic light scattering ( Zetasizer Nano ZS90 , Malvern ) . All reported hydrodynamic sizes represent the “ Z - average ” values from three independent measurements . Additional DLS size pro ﬁ les and size distribution data measured in intensity ( d i ) , number ( d n ) , and volume ( d v ) are provided in the Supporting Information . To reveal the presence of the PEG corona on the AuNP surface by TEM , 10 μ L of 2 nM NP solution was drop - cast onto a TEM copper grid ( 200 mesh ; Beijing Zhongjingkeyi Technology ) and left for 30 min . After removing the NP solution , 10 μ L of 2 % phosphotungstic acid ( Sigma ) was added onto the TEM grid for another 1 min . After removing the PTA solution , the stained grid was allowed to dry at RT for at least 4 h before visualization under TEM at a beam voltage of 100 kV ( Hitachi H7700 ) . Quanti ﬁ cation of the Loading Density of PEG Strands . The density of PEG grafted onto AuNPs was determined by thiol depletion via the Ellman ’ s assay . 34 , 35 One mL of 2 nM AuNPs was mixed with di ﬀ erent mole ratios of HS - PEG 5000 - OCH 3 and HS - PEG 5000 - C n H 2 n + 1 at a total PEG concentration of 20 PEG molecules per nm 2 of AuNP surface for 1 h under sonication . After centrifuging the NP solution at 15 , 000 rpm for 15 min , the supernatant was lyophilized and resuspended in 60 μ L of deionized water . Twenty μ L of the concentrated PEG sample was mixed with 100 μ L of Ellman ’ s assay bu ﬀ er [ 1 mM EDTA ( Sigma ) in 0 . 1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 ; pH = 8 ] . The resultant PEG sample was subsequently mixed with 50 μ L of Ellman ’ s detection bu ﬀ er [ 0 . 5 mg / mL of Ellman ’ s reagent ( 5 , 5 - dithio - bis ( 2 - nitrobenzoic acid ) ) ( JenKem Technology ) in the assay bu ﬀ er ] . AuNPs not functionalized with PEG strands were included as negative control . After 10 min of reaction , the absorbance of the reaction mixture was ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02044 ACS Nano 2017 , 11 , 6085 − 6101 6097 read at 412 nm by a Multiskan GO UV - absorbance microplate reader ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) . The concentration of PEG was calculated with reference to a standard calibration curve after subtracting the background absorbance of the sample derived from that of the negative control . Reported data represent mean ± SD from three independent experiments . Cellular Uptake . Kera - 308 cells ( mouse epidermal keratinocytes , Cell Lines Service ) , HeLa cells ( human endothelial ; ATCC ) , C166 cells ( mouse endothelial ; ATCC ) , and RAW 264 . 7 cells ( mouse macrophage ; ATCC ) were cultured in complete DMEM ( Gibco ) [ i . e . , DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Gibco ) and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( Gibco ) ] and maintained at 37 ° C and 5 % CO 2 . Before the uptake experiment , cells were seeded in 24 - well plates until the cell population reached around 80 % con ﬂ uence . The cells were incubated with 1 nM NPs formulated in 0 . 3 mL of OptiMEM ( Gibco ) per well . At various designated time points , the NPs were removed , and the cells were rinsed by PBS twice and trypsinized for cell counting by a hemocytometer . Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min . ICP - MS . Cell pellets were digested by 0 . 25 mL of aqua regia overnight at RT and further diluted to 10 mL by the matrix solution ( 2 % HCl , 2 % HNO 3 , with 10 ppb indium as internal standard ) for ICP - MS measurements ( Agilent 7900 ) . The number of AuNPs in each resultant solution was obtained by computing the di ﬀ erence in gold content between the NP - treated and untreated cells based on the calibration curves derived from AuNP solutions of known concen - trations . Reported data represent mean ± SD from three independent experiments . TEM Imaging for Cells . Freshly harvested cell pellets were ﬁ xed with glutaraldehyde ( 2 . 5 % in phosphate bu ﬀ er ; pH = 7 . 2 − 7 . 4 ) for 2 h and stained by osmium tetroxide ( 1 % ) for another 2 h . Pellets were gradually dehydrated in increasing ethanol gradients and propylene oxide . They were embedded in Epon 812 resins ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) and polymerized at 55 ° C for 48 h . Ultrathin sections of around 70 nm in thickness were deposited onto 200 - mesh copper grids ( EMS ) and stained with 4 % uranyl acetate ( Electron Microscopy Science , in 50 % methanol / water ) and Reynolds lead citrate ( Sigma ) for observation under TEM at a beam voltage of 100 kV ( Hitachi H7700 ) . Confocal Microscopy . Seeded in 35 mm confocal dishes ( SPL Life Sciences ) , cells were incubated with 1 mL of 1 nM Cy5 - labeled dodecyl 4 % - PEG - AuNPs formulated in OptiMEM for di ﬀ erent durations of time . After incubation , cells were rinsed with PBS and stained with 50 nM LysoTracker Green DND - 26 ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) in OptiMEM for 0 . 5 h . The cells were then rinsed with PBS and ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ; Sigma ) for 10 min . Cell samples were imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( Olympus FV1000 ) . The wavelengths of excitation and emission of LysoTracker Green are 488 and 520 nm , respectively . The excitation and emission wavelengths of Cy5 - labeled gold NPs are 635 and 664 nm , respectively . Pharmacological Blocking . Seeded in 24 - well plates , cells were pretreated with 0 . 3 mL of OptiMEM that contains chemical blockers at various concentrations for 3 h . These blockers include fucoidan ( 50 μ g / mL , Santa Cruz ) , ﬁ lipin III ( 2 . 5 μ g / mL , Sigma ) , chlorpromazine ( 5 μ g / mL , Tokyo Chemical Industry ) , amiloride ( 500 μ g / mL , Sigma ) , cytochalasin D ( 5 μ g / mL , Cayman Chemical ) , mannan ( 1 mg / mL , Sigma ) , dynasore ( 120 μ M , Cayman Chemical ) , methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) ( 10 mM , Tokyo Chemical Industry ) , sodium azide ( 0 . 1 % , Sigma ) , or placed at 4 ° C . After removing the inhibitor - containing medium , 0 . 3 mL of fresh OptiMEM that contains the same inhibitor at the original concentration and 1 nM of NPs was subsequently added to the cells . After 3 h of incubation , the NP - and inhibitor - containing medium was removed , and the cells were rinsed with PBS . Cell pellets were harvested for ICP - MS analysis . Transfection . Preseeded in 24 - well plates , Kera - 308 cells were grown to 70 % con ﬂ uence before transfection . 0 . 3 mL of transfection medium was added to each well . Formulated in OptiMEM , the transfection medium contains 7 μ g / mL of Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) and either 200 nM of mouse small - interfering RNA ( siRNA ) that speci ﬁ cally targets protein markers of key cellular uptake pathways ( SMARTpool , Dharmacon ) or 200 nM of nontargeting siRNA control ( siCtrl ) ( Dharmacon ) . The protein markers include caveolin - 1 ( Cav - 1 ) , clathrin heavy chain - 1 ( Clhc - 1 ) , and dynamin - 2 ( Dnm - 2 ) . After 4 h of transfection , the transfection medium was switched to complete DMEM for 16 h . The cells were then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0 . 5 % FBS and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin for another 28 h before harvesting the proteins for Western blotting or adding the NPs to determine the e ﬀ ect of genetic knockdown on cellular association .
