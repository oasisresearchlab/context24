Extending from the enzymatic core of RNA polymer - ase II ( Pol II ) is a long unstructured protein domain composed of tandem repeats of low complexity . This domain consists of heptapeptide repeats with the consen - sus sequence YSPTSPS and forms the carboxy - terminal domain ( CTD ) of the largest subunit of Pol II RNA polymerase B1 ( RPB1 ) . The number of repeats varies between species , ranging from as few as 5 in Plasmodium yoelii to 26 in budding yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) and 52 in humans 1 ( FIG . 1 ) . The CTD is not required for the catalytic functions of Pol II , but it is crucial for the regulation of multiple steps in transcription , as well as for the coupling of transcription to a number of co - transcriptional processes 2 – 5 . The transcription process in eukaryotes consists of three major stages : initiation , elongation and termination . Both the CTD in its entirety and the individual residues within the heptapeptide have crucial roles in transcription regulation throughout the transcription process . The sequence of the CTD consists of residues that can be subjected to multiple post - translational modifi - cations ( PTMs ) , including phosphorylation , proline isomerization and O‑ GlcNAcylation 2 , 5 – 8 . In addition , non - consensus Lys and Arg residues within the CTDs of some organisms can be methylated , ubiquitylated or acetylated 9 – 14 ( TABLE 1 ) . These PTMs constitute the ‘CTD code’ and are key to regulating processes such as pre - mRNA capping , splicing and the PTM of histones 2 , 4 , 6 . By far the most studied and best - characterized CTD modification is phosphorylation . In general , CTD phos - phorylation promotes or inhibits the binding of proteins to the CTD , thereby enabling the specific recruitment of appropriate proteins to transcribing Pol II throughout the transcription process 15 – 17 . The CTD is frequently referred to as a landing pad at which myriad transcription factors , chromatin modifiers and RNA processing enzymes are recruited to the actively transcribing polymerase through specific interactions with modified CTD residues 16 , 17 . Although the repetitive nature of the CTD increases the potential complexity of the code , recent work has demonstrated that many repeats within a given CTD are not phosphorylated 18 , 19 ( BOX 1 ) . Thus , combinatorial calculations imply that the number of actual CTD states is experimentally manageable : in the hundreds 18 , 19 rather than astronomical . The size of the CTD varies dramatically between species 1 , 20 . At the low end , the Trypanosoma brucei 21 Pol II lacks a CTD entirely , whereas the P . yoelii CTD has only five heptapeptide repeats , which exhibit min - imal conservation . S . cerevisiae has 26 repeats , most of which are consensus 1 , 20 . Of the 52 repeats that consti - tute the human CTD , the first 26 are highly conserved whereas the remainder are less so 1 ( FIG . 1 ) . The entire CTD code is not essential for the function of Pol II , as a full - length CTD is not required for viability or even for sustaining wild - type growth rates in budding yeast . Genetic studies have revealed that the minimal length required for viability is eight repeats and that only ten repeats are needed for growing wild - type yeast on rich media 22 . To overcome temperature sensitivity , cold sensitivity and auxotrophic phenotypes , 13 repeats are required 23 . Thus , to maintain viability , only half of the yeast CTD is required . However , recent work has demonstrated that a reduced repeat number is unstable Department of Genetics , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , USA . Correspondence to L . S .

Stirling Churchman Abstract | The carboxy‑terminal domain ( CTD ) extends from the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) as a long , repetitive and largely unstructured polypeptide chain . Throughout the transcription process , the CTD is dynamically modified by post - translational modifications , many of which facilitate or hinder the recruitment of key regulatory factors of Pol II that collectively constitute the ‘CTD code’ . Recent studies have revealed how the physicochemical properties of the CTD promote phase separation in the presence of other low - complexity domains . Here , we discuss the intricacies of the CTD code and how the newly characterized physicochemical properties of the CTD expand the function of the CTD beyond the code .

Multivalent interactions Weak non - covalent interactions between biological molecules . Liquid – liquid phase separation The process of forming fluid , liquid - like droplets or compartments . in yeast , and that DNA recombination and resolution of G - quadruplex – like DNA structures that are present in the CTD maintain the wild - type number 24 . Thus , although a handful of CTD repeats are sufficient for viability , a full - length CTD is preferred and actively maintained by the cell . Furthermore , mutations of some CTD residues in yeast are tolerated or lead to mild pheno types in other cases 22 , 25 – 30 . This finding demon - strates that the CTD code works in concert with many other processes , such as the formation of protein – RNA complexes , to control the production and processing of RNA . Thus , the CTD code is not a stand - alone code like the genetic code , but is instead a component of a larger biological mechanism that regulates transcription and co - transcriptional processes . The repetitive nature and perhaps the length of the CTD also contribute to its physical properties , which may be important for regulating transcription . The amino acid repeats within the CTD confer low - complexity protein domain properties to this region of RPB1 . Low - complexity domains are often a hallmark of proteins found in membraneless cellular compartments , which display liquid - like properties owing to numerous weak , non - covalent interactions between their various compo - nents 31 , 32 . The presence of such multivalent interactions can facilitate liquid – liquid phase separation , thereby contribut - ing to the formation of the membraneless compartments . The CTD has recently been shown to form multivalent interactions that can manifest as liquid – liquid phase separ ation 33 , 34 , suggesting another mechanism by which the CTD may regulate transcription . The CTD has been reviewed extensively 1 – 4 , 6 , 35 – 38 . Therefore , in this Review , we only briefly summarize the established roles of the CTD in transcription . We then focus on recent work demonstrating the dynamic func - tional states of the CTD and the relationships between these dynamic states and transcription . In addition , we discuss recent work suggesting that the CTD serves to regulate transcription through its intrinsic ability to form phase - separated structures through multivalent interactions with low - complexity domains of other regu latory factors 33 , 34 , implying that the role of the CTD extends beyond the CTD code . Transcription and related processes The CTD regulates each step in the transcription pro - cess , from initiation to termination . In addition , the CTD is important for regulating several co - transcriptional processes , such as splicing and chromatin modifica - tion . In this section we summarize the roles of the CTD during transcription . Transcription initiation . Pol II is recruited to promoters with an unmodified CTD 39 , 40 and forms the pre - initiation complex through interactions with general transcrip - tion factors . The CTD is important for pre - initiation complex formation because the unmodified CTD has a high affinity for the Mediator complex 39 , 41 , 42 , a transcrip - tion co - activator that is important for the formation of bridging interactions between transcription activators at enhan cers and the general transcription machinery at promoters 43 . The high affinity of the unmodified CTD for the Mediator complex is due to the formation of multi ple hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic inter - actions with subunits of the Mediator complex 39 , 41 , 42 . Promoter escape by Pol II and the transition from tran - scription initiation to elongation is partly regulated by phosphoryl ation of the CTD 44 . Residues within the CTD are referred to by their order in the heptapeptide : Tyr1 - Ser2 - Pro3 - Thr4 - Ser5 - Pro6 - Ser7 . Cyclin - dependent kinase 7 ( CDK7 ; known as Kin28 in S . cerevisiae ) , which is a component of the general transcription factor TFIIH , phosphoryl ates Ser5 and Ser7 and aids in promoter escape by Pol II . The phosphoryl ation of Ser5 lowers the affinity of Pol II for the Mediator com - plex , probably by disrupting the hydrogen bonding between them 41 , 45 – 47 . After phosphoryl ation of Ser5 and Ser7 , other CTD residues are dynamically phosphoryl - ated and dephosphorylated by several CTD kinases Nature Reviews | Molecular Cell Biology Consensus repeat Y 1 S 2 P 3 T 4 S 5 P 6 S 7 CTD 1 1 1 26 26 26 52 52 RNA Pol II core DNA S . cerevisiae H . sapiens F SPTSPTYSPTSP A YSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPS YSPTSPS YSPTSPSYSPTSP A YSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSP N YSPTSPSYSPTSP G YSPG S P A YSP KQDE YSPTSP A YEP R SP GG YTP Q SPS YSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSP N YSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPS YSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSP N YSPTSP N Y T PTSPS YSPTSPSYSPTSP N Y T PTSP N YSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSP S SP R Y T P Q SP T Y T P S SPS YSP S SPS YSPTSP K Y T PTSPS YSP SS P E Y T PTSP K YSPTSP K YSPTSP K YSPTSP T YSPT T P K YSPTSP T YSPTSP V Y T PTSP K YSPTSP T YSPTSP K YSPTSP T YSPTSP KGST YSPTSP T YSPTSP G YS L TSP A ISPDDSDEEN QKHNENENSR Figure 1 | The composition and conservation of the CTD .

Promoter - proximal pausing In metazoans , highly regulated pausing of RNA polymerase II downstream of promoters , which controls the transition into productive transcription elongation . and phosphatases 2 throughout the transcription pro - cess . Thus , the unmodified CTD has been predomin - antly implicated in transcription initi ation , whereas post - translationally modified CTD exists predominantly during transcription elongation 44 , 48 . CTD phosphorylation dynamics during transcription . In both budding yeast and humans , each of the hepta - peptide residues Tyr1 , Ser2 , Thr4 , Ser5 and Ser7 is phosphorylated at some point during transcription , and the relative abundance of these modifications changes along the gene 15 , 49 – 58 ( FIG . 2a ) . The first modifications that were studied in detail were the phosphorylation of Ser5 and Ser2 . These studies revealed that the levels of phosphoryl ated Ser5 ( Ser5P ) peak near the promoter and transcription start site ( TSS ) of genes , whereas Ser2P levels increase across gene bodies before decreas - ing sharply after the polyadenylation site ( PAS ) 15 , 53 , 59 . These patterns appear throughout the genome and are conserved across multiple species , including humans 2 , 6 , 55 , 60 – 62 . The phosphorylation patterns of each residue along protein - coding genes have been exten - sively characterized in yeast 28 , 51 , 60 – 63 and in mammal ian cells 6 , 49 , 50 , 55 and are mostly similar across species ( FIG . 2a ) . One exception is Tyr1P in budding yeast , which has a similar phosphorylation profile to that of Ser2P , although its levels decrease before the PAS . By contrast , Tyr1P levels in metazoans are highest near the promoter , and Tyr1P peaks are associated with paused Pol II in both the sense and antisense directions 49 , 50 ( FIG . 2a ) . Broadly speaking , changes in the CTD phosphorylation state are coupled with transcription stage ( FIG . 2b ) , with major changes in CTD phosphorylation occurring at transitions between transcription initiation , elongation and termination 6 . These phosphorylation patterns are not coincidental ; they are crucial for the recruitment of key regulatory factors that control these transitions as well as the modification of chromatin and processing of the nascent RNA , as we discuss next . Transcription elongation . The regulation of transcrip - tion elongation is strongly linked to the CTD phos - phorylation state . In metazoans , a key regulatory event during elongation is promoter - proximal pausing , which occurs 20 – 100 bp downstream of the TSS , at the tran - sition between early and productive elongation 64 . Pol II pausing is induced when Pol II is bound by negative elongation factor ( NELF ) and DRB sensitivity - inducing Table 1 | Post - translational modifications of the CTD and their associated processes Post - translational modification Position in the CTD Organisms Associated process or processes Refs Ser5 phosphorylation Multiple repeats • Saccharomyces cerevisiae • Schizosaccharomyces pombe • Homo sapiens Transcription initiation , mRNA capping and splicing , non - coding RNA transcription termination and chromatin modification 15 , 25 , 28 , 52 , 103 , 105 , 108 , 110 , 133 Ser2 phosphorylation Multiple repeats • S . cerevisiae • S . pombe • H . sapiens Transcription elongation , promoter - proximal pause and release , splicing , transcription termination and DNA topology 25 , 53 , 64 , 72 , 76 , 88 , 102 , 114 , 129 , 131 Ser7 phosphorylation Multiple repeats • S . cerevisiae • S . pombe • H . sapiens snRNA expression , interaction with the Integrator complex and P - TEFb recognition 58 , 156 , 157 Thr4 phosphorylation Multiple repeats • S . cerevisiae • S . pombe • Gallus gallus • H . sapiens Transcription elongation and termination , post - transcriptional splicing , processing of histone mRNA and chromatin remodelling 27 , 28 , 54 , 55 Tyr1 phosphorylation Multiple repeats • S . cerevisiae • S . pombe • G . gallus • H . sapiens Inhibition of recruitment of transcription termination factors , CTD stability , antisense and enhancer transcription 49 – 51 Arg methylation Arg1 , 810 of human RPB1 • Mus musculus • H . sapiens snRNA and snoRNA regulation , R - loop resolution and transcription termination 9 , 14 Lys methylation Lys7 in the non‑consensus region of human CTD • H . sapiens • M . musculus • Drosophila melanogaster • Caenorhabditis elegans Supports nucleosome occupancy at promoters ; negatively regulates gene expression 11 , 13 Lys acetylation Lys7 in the non‑consensus region of murine CTD ; Lys7 in repeats 39 , 42 , 47 and 49 of human CTD • H . sapiens • M . musculus Induction of growth - factor response genes , transcription elongation ; maintains balance between Lys methylation and acetylation and affects mRNA expression levels 10 , 11 , 13 O ‑GlcNAcylation Ser5 and / or Ser7 in multiple repeats H . sapiens Pre - initiation complex assembly 7 , 8 Ubiquitylation RPB1 Lys residues 859 , 1866 , 1873 , 1887 , 1908 , 1922 M . musculus RPB1 degradation 12 CTD , carboxy - terminal domain of RNA polymerase II ; P - TEFb , positive transcription elongation factor B ; RPB1 , RNA polymerase B1 ; snRNA , small nuclear RNA ; snoRNA , small nucleolar RNA .

A transcription elongation complex that regulates both transcription and chromatin modification . factor ( DSIF ) , which is a heterodimer of SPT4 and SPT5 ( REFS 64 – 66 ) . Positive transcription elongation factor B ( P - TEFb ) 64 , 66 , 67 , which is composed of CDK9 and cyclin T , phosphorylates NELF , causing its dissoci - ation , and phosphorylates DSIF , converting it into a pos - itive transcription elongation factor , thereby triggering Pol II - pause release 68 ( FIG . 2b ) . P - TEFb also phosphoryl - ates Ser2 , which is coincidental with promoter - proximal pause release 66 , 69 , and also directly recruits several elong - ation and chromatin - modifying factors 70 – 73 . Recent work has expanded our knowledge of the regu lation of this transition by identifying other key factors , such as bromodomain - containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ) , which is an atypical CTD kinase 74 , and the transcription elong ation complex RNA polymerase II - associated factor ( PAF1 ) 75 , 76 . Much of this regulation is orchestrated by CTD kinases 66 , 74 , 77 , emphasizing the importance of CTD phosphorylation in this transition . In addition to its role in promoter - proximal pausing , the phosphoryl - ated CTD promotes the recruitment of the PAF1 complex and other transcription elongation factors , such as SPT6 and the human transcription elongation regulator 1 like ( TCERG1 ) 28 , 72 , 78 – 81 . Although the roles of some CTD kinases are clear , the roles of other CTD kinases remain controversial . For example , Drosophila melanogaster P - TEFb is the major Ser2 kinase at the 5ʹ region of genes , whereas CDK12 is the major Ser2 kinase during elongation 82 . In human cells , two CDKs can phosphorylate the CTD during elongation : CDK12 and its homologue CDK13 . CDK12 appears to be promiscuous and is able to phosphorylate Ser5 , Ser7 and Ser2 in vitro 83 , whereas CDK13 is able to phosphorylate Ser5 and Ser2 in vitro 84 . Adding to the complexity , knock - down or chemical inhibition of CDK12 or CDK13 has very little effect on global CTD phosphorylation in vivo and modest effects on gene expression 82 , 84 – 86 . Thus , the exact roles and interplay between P - TEFb , CDK12 and CDK13 remain elusive . Finally , although it is clear that CTD modifications affect the regula - tion of transcription elongation , it remains unknown whether the reverse is true . That is , whether transcrip - tion elongation also affects CTD modifications and why transitions in CTD state occur at specific stages of gene transcription . Directing co‑transcriptional processes . The phos - phorylation state of the CTD couples Pol II to a suite of factors that regulate transcription elongation , mRNA processing , chromatin modification and even DNA topology 2 , 71 , 87 , 88 ( TABLE 1 ) . Consequently , the CTD contrib utes to co - transcriptional processes by granting regulatory factors intimate access to Pol II , the nascent RNA and chromatin . The influence of the CTD on RNA processing is facilitated by the position - ing of the CTD proximal to the RNA exit channel 89 , 90 . To illustrate the importance of this proximity , the CTD can function when it is attached to Pol II sub - units other than RPB1 , but only in configurations that place the CTD near its original position 89 . Factors that are involved in numerous complexes and processes ( reviewed in REFS 2 , 68 ) interact with the CTD , and new factors are continually being added to this list . For some co - transcriptional processes , the role of the CTD is well established , whereas for others the role of the CTD is emerging . The CTD is important for the regulation of mRNA capping , which is the first step of mRNA processing . Ser5P levels peak early in transcription , near the TSS ( FIG . 2a ) , and Ser5P contributes to the recruitment of the mRNA capping complex 15 , 52 , thereby coupling RNA capping to early transcription elongation . Once recruited , the interaction of Ser5P with the capping complex allosterically aids in its activation 91 . Rapid capping of the transcript is crucial because down - stream mRNA processing , including splicing and 3ʹ end cleavage and polyadenylation , require a prop - erly capped transcript 92 – 95 . The crucial role of Ser5 in mRNA capping is highlighted by the lethal phenotype caused by Ser5 - to - Ala substitutions in fission yeast ( Schizosaccharomyces pombe ) , which can be over - come by tethering the capping complex to the CTD 25 . Thus , the essential role of Ser5 in fission yeast is the recruitment of the capping complex to Pol II . Box 1 | Mapping and quantifying CTD phosphorylation Much of the available data regarding the carboxy - terminal domain ( CTD ) code was obtained using antibodies that specifically recognize different phosphorylated residues of the CTD . Many monoclonal antibodies recognizing single , double or unphosphorylated CTD have been developed 6 , 105 , 154 . The best antibodies target a specific phosphorylated residue ( for example , phosphorylated Ser5 ( Ser5P ) ) within a diheptad , which is the minimal functional unit of the CTD 155 . Epitope masking , cross - reactivity and interference by other modifications can complicate the use of phospho - CTD - specific antibodies . Many CTD - specific antibodies have been characterized in vitro in an effort to understand their limitations 6 , 105 , although the degree to which these limitations hold true in vivo is unclear . Nonetheless , these phospho - CTD - specific antibodies have been used with great success to examine CTD function . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) with phospho - CTD - specific antibodies has been the method of choice for mapping levels of phospho - CTD modifications across individual genes and entire genomes 20 . Phospho - CTD - specific antibodies have also been used to monitor changes in CTD phosphorylation during transcription activation in live - cell imaging 154 and to purify distinct transcription complexes associated with each phospho - CTD modification 28 . The affinity and avidity differences between phospho - CTD - specific antibodies prevent comparison of phosphorylation levels between different CTD residues . Furthermore , it is not yet possible to use these antibodies to determine which heptapeptides are phosphorylated . To address these limitations by mass spectrometry , it is necessary to create genetically modified CTD constructs that enable trypsin digestion of the CTD , resulting in unique peptides whose location within the CTD molecule can be deduced from their mass 18 , 19 . In two studies , mass spectrometry analysis of modified CTDs revealed the relative abundance of each modification across the CTD , as well as similar trends in CTD phosphorylation between yeast and humans . Ser5P and Ser2P were the most abundant modifications in both yeast and humans , followed by Thr4P and Tyr1P . Ser7P exhibited the lowest level of phosphorylation , although Ser7P levels may have been artificially reduced by the genetic manipulation of the CTD required for mass spectrometry analysis . Interestingly , the CTD is phosphorylated in a relatively uniform manner with individual phospho - modifications being evenly distributed across the heptapeptides . Most phosphorylated repeats contain a single phospho - modification , and many repeats are entirely unphosphorylated 18 , 19 . The possibility that multiple phospho - modifications in close proximity could clash sterically or electrostatically might explain the observed dearth of phosphorylation . Another possibility is that unphosphorylated CTD repeats are important for CTD function throughout the transcription process .

Another process that is regulated by the CTD is co - transcriptional splicing , which is tightly coupled to transcription elongation 87 . In budding yeast , splic - ing machineries are co - transcriptionally recruited : a majority of splicing occurs co - transcriptionally and splicing occurs almost immediately after the 3ʹ splice site is transcribed 28 , 96 – 106 . Taken together , these obser - vations suggest that the recruitment of the splicing machinery to Pol II is highly regulated . In mammals , the phosphorylated CTD promotes splicing 101 , and mutating Ser2 decreases spliceosome recruitment 102 . In yeast , the spliceosome interacts with Ser5P 28 , 103 . The recent advent of higher resolution chromatin immuno - precipitation ( ChIP ) techniques 28 and strand - specific high - resolution mapping of Pol II revealed dynamic remodelling of CTD phosphoryl ation at specific genomic loci 104 , 105 . In particular , there is strong modifi - cation of the CTD within a narrow region around splice sites 28 , 104 , 105 . In budding yeast , the 3ʹ splice site is associated with low levels of Thr4P and elevated levels of Ser5P and Ser7P 28 , 104 . In mammalian cells , Pol II containing high levels of Ser5P co - purified with splicing intermediates , suggesting that the spliceo - some is associ ated with Ser5P during transcription 105 . Moreover , the ChIP profiles of Ser5P and U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein A , which is a component of the U1 spliceosomal subcomplex , are nearly identical at 3ʹ splice sites in budding yeast 28 . Given that Ser5P inter - acts with the spliceosome , these data suggest that ele - vated Ser5P levels contribute to the recruitment of the spliceosome near 3ʹ splice sites 28 , 103 , 105 and assist in the regulation of co - transcriptional splicing . Furthermore , Pol II pauses directly at splice sites in both yeast and humans 28 , 106 , suggesting that Pol II elongation dynam - ics , CTD phosphorylation and co - transcriptional splicing are coupled .

The profiles of budding yeast and humans are highly similar , except for phosphorylated Tyr1 ( Tyr1P ) . See the main text for details about the functions of each modification . b | Transcription in eukaryotes consists of several stages , including initiation , elongation and termination , which coincide with changes in the phosphorylation state of the CTD . Four steps of the transcription cycle are depicted with the corresponding CTD phosphorylation state and associated factors . Step 1 depicts the recruitment of the core Pol II enzyme to the promoter with an unphosphorylated CTD that interacts with the Mediator complex . The Mediator complex has a high affinity for unphosphorylated CTD and upon phosphorylation of Ser5 of the CTD by cyclin - dependent kinase 7 ( CDK7 ; not shown ) , this affinity is lost and Pol II escapes from the promoter . Step 2 depicts Pol II during promoter - proximal pausing , which regulates the transition into productive transcription elongation in metazoans . At this step , Pol II is highly phosphorylated at Ser5 and Ser7 , is paused downstream of the transcription start site ( TSS ) and is bound by negative elongation factor ( NELF ) and DRB sensitivity - inducing factor ( DSIF ) . The arrival of positive elongation factor B ( P - TEFb ) leads to the phosphorylation of NELF , DSIF and Ser2 . These phosphorylation events are followed by the release of NELF and the transition into productive transcription elongation . During productive elongation ( step 3 ) , the CTD contains lower levels of Ser5P and Ser7P and higher levels of Ser2P , which promotes the recruitment of many transcription elongation , chromatin - modifying and RNA - processing factors that regulate co - transcriptional processes . Finally , at step 4 , Pol II transitions from transcription elongation to termination . Ser2P and Thr4P levels peak , thereby promoting the recruitment of cleavage and polyadenylation factors , as well as termination factors that release Pol II from the DNA .

Non - coding RNAs that are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome . Chromatin modification and DNA topology . The CTD also contributes to the recruitment and regula - tion of histone modifiers . For example , Ser5P recruits complex proteins associated with Set1 ( COMPASS ) to the 5ʹ region of genes , thereby inducing methylation of histone 3 at Lys4 ( H3K4me ) , which in turn recruits transcription elongation factors 107 – 110 . Ser5 and Ser2 phosphorylation is important for recruiting the H3K36 methyltransferase SET domain - containing protein 2 ( SET2 ) 111 – 113 . H3K36 methylation is crucial for regulating transcription elongation and chromatin stability and for preventing intragenic transcription initiation , partly by recruiting and activating the histone deacetylase com - plex ( HDAC ) RPD3S 111 , 112 , 114 – 117 . The SET3 complex and HDACs such as RPD3S can also be directly recruited to Pol II by the CTD 118 , 119 , as can the histone acetyltrans - ferase ( HAT ) complexes NUA4 and SAGA 120 , 121 . These findings highlight the importance of transcription and CTD phosphorylation in the regulation of histone acetylation . However , as both HDACs and HATs can be recruited to Pol II , the exact mechanisms by which the CTD , and more generally transcription , regulate histone acetylation levels across gene bodies require further exploration . Recent work has shown that the CTD can also control DNA topology during transcription elong - ation by recruiting and stimulating topoisomerase I through Ser2 phosphorylation 88 . This work expands the known roles of the CTD , strengthening the link between transcription and DNA structure and topology 122 – 128 . Transcription termination . The CTD is associated with transcription termination and 3ʹ end processing of coding genes in both yeast and humans . In yeast , Ser2P binds directly to members of the cleavage and poly adenylation and termination machinery , such as protein 1 of cleav - age and polyadenylation factor I ( Pcf11 ) and regulator of Ty1 transposition protein 103 ( Rtt103 ) 129 – 132 . However , Ser2P is not solely responsible for the recruitment of these factors , because although Ser2P levels are high across gene bodies ( FIG . 2 ) , Pcf11 and Rtt103 levels are highly concentrated at the 3ʹ ends of genes 51 . Tyr1P is a likely candidate for some of the observed specifi city . In vitro , Tyr1P prevents the binding of termination factors to the CTD 51 , and Tyr1P levels decrease before PAS in yeast cells . However , overall Tyr1P is detected at much lower levels than Ser2P 18 , 19 , suggesting that the tight recruitment window of termination factors to regions near the PAS probably requires additional CTD modifications . Indeed , Thr4P levels were recently demonstrated to peak downstream of the PAS ( FIG . 2 ) , and Thr4P interacts with Rtt103 ( REF . 28 ) . Thus , three CTD modifications are implicated in the recruitment of tran - scription termin ation factors to Pol II : first , Ser2P binds to and presumably helps to recruit Rtt103 and Pcf11 ; second , Thr4P binds to Rtt103 ; and third , Tyr1P pre - vents the binding of Rtt103 and Pcf11 in vitro 28 , 51 ( FIG . 3 ) . These CTD modifications , along with sequences in the RNA , are likely to collaborate to regulate transcription termination and cleavage and polyadenylation in yeast , illustrating the complexity of the CTD code . In budding yeast , Ser5 phosphorylation is associ - ated with transcription termination of non - coding RNAs through the NNS complex , which is respon - sible for terminating the transcription of small nuclear RNAs ( snRNAs ) , small nucleolar RNAs ( snoRNAs ) and cryptic unstable transcripts ( CUTs ) 133 , 134 . The NNS com - plex consists of the RNA - binding proteins nuclear pre - mRNA downregulation protein 1 ( Nrd1 ) and nuclear polyadenyl ated RNA - binding protein 3 ( Nab3 ) and the helicase splicing endonuclease 1 ( Sen1 ) 135 . The NNS complex is partly recruited to Pol II through binding of Nrd1 to Ser5P 136 . Transcription termination by the NNS complex is tightly coupled to RNA processing because the NNS complex interacts with the nuclear exosome to process snRNAs and sno RNAs and rapidly degrades CUTs 137 . Other CTD residues are associated with the termin - ation of multiple classes of transcript . For example , Ser7P was implicated in regulating 3ʹ processing at snRNA genes in mammals 58 , although the exact mechanism is unclear , and Thr4P was implicated in 3ʹ processing of histone genes in vertebrates 54 . Thus , the CTD is linked to termination and 3ʹ end processing of both coding and non - coding transcripts from yeast to mammals .

Shades along the x axis represent the phosphorylation state of the carboxy - terminal domain ( CTD ) of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) around the polyadenylation site ( PAS ) of protein - coding genes . Shown are the chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) profiles of the cleavage and polyadenylation complex component protein 1 of cleavage and polyadenylation factor I ( Pcf11 ) and the transcription termination factor regulator of Ty transposition protein 103 ( Rtt103 ) . Three positions along the gene body ( steps 1 – 3 ) depict the phosphorylation state of the CTD and its interactions with Pcf11 and Rtt103 , together suggesting a model for the precise recruitment of Pcf11 and Rtt103 during transcription . During transcription elongation ( step 1 ) , phosphorylated Tyr1 ( Tyr1P ) prevents the recruitment of Pcf11 and Rtt103 to Pol II . Loss of Tyr1P and elevated Ser2P levels ( step 2 ) recruit Pcf11 to Pol II for cleavage and polyadenylation of the nascent transcript . Ser2P and Thr4P recruit Rtt103 ( step 3 ) and transition Pol II into the termination stage . Because Rtt103 can bind to both Ser2P and Thr4P , three possible states of CTD - bound Rtt103 are represented downstream of the PAS . In one state , Rtt103 binds to Ser2P , and in another , Rtt103 binds to Thr4P . In the third state , both Pcf11 and Rtt103 may be co‑recruited by binding to different CTD modifications to coordinate cleavage and polyadenylation with transcription termination .

Cajal bodies Membrane - less nuclear compartments comprising mainly RNA and protein and where RNA processing and maturation occurs . P bodies Membrane - less cytoplasmic compartments where several RNA processing events occur . Hydrogels Macromolecular polymers composed of a network of multivalent interactions . The CTD in liquid – liquid phase separation Many biological processes are partly regulated by liquid – liquid phase separations , which exploit multivalent interactions between low - complexity protein domains and RNA 31 , 138 – 142 ( FIG . 4a ) . Low - complexity domains and intrinsically disordered domains and proteins form liquid - like droplets throughout the cell 141 , and these droplets act as compartments that trap and localize proteins 140 , 141 . Examples of such droplets include Cajal bodies , nucleoli and P bodies 140 , 141 . Recent in vitro studies have established that the Pol II CTD can be incorpor - ated into and form liquid phase - separated compart - ments and hydrogels , revealing potential roles for the CTD beyond factor recruitment 33 , 34 . Two transcription - related proteins that contain low - complexity domains , the fused in sarcoma ( FUS ) protein and the general transcription factor TATA - binding protein - associated factor 2N ( TAF2N ; also known as TAF15 ) , enabled the phase separations observed in these studies . This result suggests another mechanism for gene activation , whereby Pol II is recruited to promoters through the incorporation of the CTD into liquid phase - separated compartments that are formed by low - complexity domains of transcription factors 33 , 34 . TAF15 hydrogels that were formed in vitro could interact with the CTD in a manner that depended on its length and phosphorylation state : a CTD with only five heptapeptide repeats was not incorporated into the hydrogels , whereas CTDs with ten or more repeats were efficiently incorporated 33 . Notably , the minimal CTD length for viability in yeast is eight to ten repeats , the size required for efficient hydrogel incorporation . Phosphorylation also modulated CTD incorporation into the TAF15 hydrogels , whereby highly phosphorylated CTD was not retained . These results suggest a potential Pol II recruitment and transcription initiation mechanism , whereby Pol II with an unphosphorylated CTD is partly recruited to promoters via its incorporation into a liquid – liquid phase - separated compartment , and is released from this compartment into transcription elongation follow ing phosphorylation of the CTD . Moreover , the degenerate carboxy - terminal region of the CTD ( found in mammals ) was more efficiently retained by Nature Reviews | Molecular Cell Biology Transcriptionfactors RNA CTD Soluble , multivalent , low - complexity domains Liquid – liquid phase separation Increasingconcentration a b DNA DNA Liquid - like droplet Enhancer Transcriptionco - activators CTD Promoter RNA SenseTSS DivergentTSS eRNA Pol II core Figure 4 | Formation of compartments by liquid – liquid phase - separation . a | Many biological molecules such as proteins and RNA contain unstructured , disordered regions or regions of low complexity .

TAF15 hydrogels than the conserved amino - terminal region where the Mediator complex binds 41 , 42 . Thus , the recruitment of Pol II to promoters through CTD hydrogel formation would not interfere with Mediator binding ; hence , both liquid – liquid phase separation and the Mediator complex could contribute to Pol II recruitment . The CTD is also incorporated into FUS hydrogels in vitro 33 , 34 , and mutations in FUS that alter the capacity of the protein to form hydrogels also hamper its capacity to activate gene expression 33 . The CTD can nucleate liquid - like phase separation of the FUS low - complexity domain in vitro 34 ; FUS also associates with the CTD in vivo , and FUS depletion prevents inappropriate hyperphosphorylation of Ser2 ( REF . 143 ) . However , there is currently no evidence to indicate that FUS and the CTD engage in phase separation in vivo . Moreover , as the CTD - induced TAF15 and FUS phase - separation experiments were performed in vitro , it remains unclear whether and to what extent they occur in vivo . Nevertheless , it is possible that at least under some conditions , cells can take advantage of the unique physicochemical prop - erties of the Pol II CTD to regulate transcription and co - transcriptional processes . Given that the CTD and transcription - related factors can be incorporated into liquid - like droplets , it is intriguing to speculate that the CTD is important for liquid - like phase separation during transcription initiation and other stages of transcription in vivo . A recent study demonstrated the essential function of Thr4 during mitosis , possibly by interacting with other low - complexity domain proteins and form - ing liquid - like droplets 144 . Clusters of Pol II , whereby numerous Pol II molecules are localized to a specific nuclear region , have been observed during transcrip - tion 145 – 147 . Interestingly , the existence of these clusters is linked to transcriptional output as cluster lifetimes correlate with nascent RNA production 146 . Moreover , activation of transcription at the heat shock loci in D . melanogaster results in the formation of a transcrip - tion ‘compartment’ , where Pol II molecules are recycled during the transcription process 147 , 148 . Intriguingly , these compartments require active poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) . The polymer product of PARP is structurally similar to RNA and can nucleate liquid – liquid phase separation in the presence of intrinsically unstructured domains or repeated domains 149 , 150 . Thus , an interesting possibility is that these compartments are the result of in vivo phase separation at the heat shock loci . Although the formation and composition of these transient transcription clusters remain largely elusive , the abundance of low - complexity domains among transcription factors 138 , 139 , and the presence of the CTD , the nascent RNA and probably other poly - mers in the clusters , indicate that these compartments could be liquid - like droplets formed by a phase separ - ation . A compelling possibility is that some of these clusters are nucleated by the colocalization of multiple enhancers with their target promoter . Enhancers and promoters are bidirectionally transcribed , which could lead to high local concentration of Pol II , transcription factors and RNA , thereby contributing to the forma - tion of liquid - like droplets 64 , 146 , 151 – 153 ( FIG . 4b ) . Thus , an interest ing hypothesis is that enhancers and antisense transcription may partially regulate transcription through nucleating droplet formation . It remains unexplored whether the CTD can be involved in the formation of liquid - like droplets after transcription initiation . Many liquid - like droplets contain RNA , and nascent RNA might encourage the formation of such droplets with the CTD or other tran - scription and RNA - processing factors . In vitro , the CTD must be unphosphorylated to efficiently associate with TAF15 hydrogels 33 , 143 . However , given that FUS has been shown to regulate CTD phosphorylation in vivo it is possible that the CTD and other regulatory factors may phase separate in a way that tolerates or even requires CTD phosphorylation 33 . This could be induced perhaps by recruiting factors that regulate liquid – liquid phase separation or by increasing the hydrogen - bonding potential of the CTD . Furthermore , even during tran - scription elongation , regions of individual CTDs will be unphosphorylated or minimally phosphorylated ( BOX 1 ) , potentially allowing multiple modes of inter - action with liquid - like droplets 18 , 19 . Clearly , more studies are required to investigate these hypotheses ; neverthe - less , these recent observations certainly imply that the CTD has roles beyond that of a simple landing pad for transcription - associated factors . Concluding remarks The presence of multiple heptapeptide repeats and numerous potential PTMs in the CTD implied the existence of a vast number of possible CTD functional states . However , the combinatorial complexity of the CTD code is limited by the fact that on average , each repeat contains less than one phosphorylated resi - due 18 , 19 ( BOX 1 ) . Despite this considerable reduction in complexity , the number of possible states is still large ; consequently , our understanding of the code remains incomplete . Many questions remain regarding how the CTD is spatiotemporally modified , as well as how vari - ous modifications work together to promote or block association of regulatory factors . Furthermore , the dis - tribution of PTMs across the many heptapeptide repeats of individual CTD molecules and the number of factors that occupy an individual CTD remain unknown . To address these questions , it will be necessary to analyse single CTD molecules . Another challenge is to reconcile how the CTD serves as a protein landing pad , with its propensity to form separated liquid droplets and / or hydrogels . Answering these questions will require in vivo assays capable of monitoring liquid – liquid phase separ ation at small scales . In addition , in vitro studies must be performed to determine how the physicochemical properties of phosphorylated and non - phosphorylated CTDs relate to their interactions with regulatory mol - ecules . These studies will shed new light on the roles of the CTD , improve our understanding of its function beyond the CTD code and enable a deeper appreciation of transcriptional regulation .
