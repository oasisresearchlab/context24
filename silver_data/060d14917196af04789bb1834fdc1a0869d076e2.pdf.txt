Grant 1 , * 1 Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry Rutgers University Piscataway , New Jersey 08854 Summary Background : Alix / Bro1p family proteins have recently been identiﬁed as important components of multivesic - ular endosomes ( MVEs ) and are involved in the sorting of endocytosed integral membrane proteins , interacting with components of the ESCRT complex , the unconven - tional phospholipid LBPA , and other known endocytosis regulators . During infection , Alix can be co - opted by enveloped retroviruses , including HIV , providing an important function during virus budding from the plasma membrane . In addition , Alix is associated with the actin cytoskeleton and might regulate cytoskeletal dynamics . Results : Here we demonstrate a novel physical interac - tion between the only apparent Alix / Bro1p family protein in C . elegans , ALX - 1 , and a key regulator of receptor recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane , called RME - 1 . The analysis of alx - 1 mutants indicates that ALX - 1 is required for the endocytic recycling of speciﬁc basolateral cargo in the C . elegans intestine , a pathway previously deﬁned by the analysis of rme - 1 mutants . The expression of truncated human Alix in HeLa cells disrupts the recycling of major histocompat - ibility complex class I , a known Ehd1 / RME - 1 - dependent transport step , suggesting the phylogenetic conserva - tion of this function . We show that the interaction of ALX - 1 with RME - 1 in C . elegans , mediated by RME - 1 / YPSL and ALX - 1 / NPF motifs , is required for this recy - cling process . In the C . elegans intestine , ALX - 1 local - izes to both recycling endosomes and MVEs , but the ALX - 1 / RME - 1 interaction appears to be dispensable for ALX - 1 function in MVEs and / or late endosomes . Conclusions : This work provides the ﬁrst demonstra - tion of a requirement for an Alix / Bro1p family member in the endocytic recycling pathway in association with the recycling regulator RME - 1 . Introduction The endocytic pathway of eukaryotes is essential for the internalization and trafﬁcking of macromolecules , ﬂuid , membranes , and membrane proteins . Membrane - asso - ciated receptors and ligands are endocytosed either through clathrin - dependent or clathrin - independent uptake mechanisms [ 1 , 2 ] . After the cargo is sorted in early endosomes , some cargo is transported from early to late endosomes and eventually to lysosomes for degradation [ 3 ] . Other cargo types recycle to the plasma membrane either directly , or indirectly via recycling endosomes [ 3 , 4 ] . Studies in HeLa cells indicate that receptors internalized via clathrin - dependent and cla - thrin - independent mechanisms meet in the endosomal system but then recycle to the cell surface in distinct carriers [ 5 ] . In recent years , it has become clear that Alix / Bro1p family proteins are conserved components of endoso - mal transport pathways . Alix and Bro1p are thought to function in the multivesicular endosome ( MVE ) pathway , promoting the degradation of integral membrane pro - teins [ 6 , 7 ] . Multivesicular endosomes contain lumenal vesicles formed by the inward invagination of the limit - ing membrane , and they likely represent intermediates in the maturation of the pleiomorphic early endosomes into late endosomes [ 8 ] . Membrane proteins sorted into the lumenal vesicles of MVEs are degraded upon the fusion of the MVEs with lysosomes in metazoans and with the vacuole in yeast [ 9 ] . The sorting of cargo , and the budding of vesicles into the lumen of the MVE , depends on a network of proteins organized into four major hetero - oligomeric complexes and several mono - meric or homo - oligomeric proteins : the Vps27 / Hse1 complex ( Hrs / STAM in humans ) , ESCRT - I , II , and III , the AAA ATPase Vps4 , the ubiquitin hydrolase Doa4p , and Alix / Bro1p . Alix and Bro1p contain a conserved w 380 amino acid Bro1 domain near their N termini [ 10 , 11 ] . Alix / Bro1p also contains a central V domain ( aa 362 – 702 in Alix ) consist - ingoftwoextendedthree - helixbundlesandaconserved C - terminal proline - rich domain ( PRD ) [ 12 ] . The Bro1 domain is necessary for the endosomal localization of Alix / Bro1pandmediatesmembraneassociationthrough binding to the ESCRT - III complex subunit Snf7p / CHMP4b [ 6 , 13 – 15 ] . ThePRDofAlixinteractswithanum - ber of endocytic regulatory proteins , including SETA [ 16 ] , endophilins [ 17 ] , and the ESCRT - I complex subunit Tsg101 [ 18 , 19 ] . Through the second arm of its V domain , Alix also interacts with HIV - 1 Gag and other retroviral proteins containing the motif tyrosine - proline - X - leucine ( YPXL ) , promoting the budding of viral particles from the plasma membrane [ 12 , 18 – 20 ] . Likewise , the Aspergillus Alix homolog PalA interacts with the PacC protein through YPXL motifs [ 21 ] . In vitro Alix is preferentially recruited by liposomes containing the phospholipid 2 , 2 0 lysobi - sphosphatidic acid ( LBPA ) [ 22 ] . LBPA is enriched in the internal membranes of MVEs and possesses the capacity to drive the formation of membrane invagina - tions within acidic liposomes [ 22 ] . It has been suggested thatAlixisatargetforthisimportantlipid , potentiallyreg - ulatingtheinvaginationprocessorbackfusionofinternalvesicleswiththelimitingmembrane [ 22 ] . Alix also asso - ciates with structural proteins of the cytoskeleton , espe - cially actin [ 23 , 24 ] , and is important for the actin - depen - dent intracellular positioning of endosomes , and the formation of stress ﬁbers , in tissue culture cells [ 23 , 25 ] . * Correspondence : grant @ biology . rutgers . edu We and others have previously established in vivo endocytic assay systems for the genetic analysis of trafﬁcking in C . elegans tissues [ 26 – 29 ] . Among the endocytic regulators found in our screens , we identiﬁed RME - 1 [ 30 ] . rme - 1 mutants display endocytic recycling defects in several tissues [ 30 ] , including the strongly reduced uptake of yolk proteins by oocytes , due to poor recycling of yolk receptors , reduced uptake of ﬂuid - phase markers by coelomocytes , and the accumu - lation of gigantic ﬂuid - ﬁlled recycling endosomes in the intestinal cells , due to defective recycling of basolater - ally endocytosed pseudocoelomic ﬂuid . Evidence from studies of mammalian Ehd1 / mRme - 1 also indicates a function in recycling , speciﬁcally in the exit of mem - brane proteins from recycling endosomes [ 31 ] . All mem - bers of the RME - 1 family contain a C - terminal eps15 homology ( EH ) domain [ 30 , 32 ] . The EH domain is asso - ciated with endocytic transport in mammalian cells and yeast [ 33 , 34 ] . Previous studies showed that the EH do - main of RME - 1 homologs , and that of other EH domain proteins , interacts with target proteins through speciﬁc binding to sequences containing asparagine - proline - phenylalanine ( NPF ) motifs [ 32 , 33 , 35 ] . In mammals , RME - 1 / Ehd1 forms protein complexes with syndapin through EH - NPF interactions , which is important for recycling endosome function [ 36 ] . Here , we show that C . elegans ALX - 1 is physically associated with both recycling endosomes and MVEs and provide evidence that ALX - 1 functions with RME - 1 in the C . elegans intestine , promoting the recycling of basolateral cargo internalized independently of clathrin . This endocytic recycling regulation requires the RME - 1 / ALX - 1 interaction and is speciﬁcally mediated by RME - 1 - YPSL and ALX - 1 - NPF motifs . Results Physical Association of ALX - 1 and RME - 1 In order to identify new regulators of endocytic recy - cling , we performed a yeast two - hybrid screen for bind - ing partners of RME - 1 by using the C - terminal region of RME - 1 including the EH domain ( isoform D , amino acids 442 – 576 ) as bait . This screen identiﬁed several interact - ing clones encoding ALX - 1 , the C . elegans ortholog of human Alix / AIP1 and yeast Bro1p ( Figure 1 and the Supplemental Experimental Procedures in the Supple - mental Data available online ) . We conﬁrmed the binding interaction by using an in vitro glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - pulldown assay ( Figure S1 , as indicated ) . The novel interaction that we detected between ALX - 1 and the recycling endosome protein RME - 1 suggested that ALX - 1 might function on recycling endosomes , in addi - tion to MVEs , or that RME - 1 has a previously undetected function in the MVE . ToclarifyinteractiondomainswithinRME - 1andALX - 1 , we tested a series of truncated versions of the proteins in thetwo - hybrid assay . Thisanalysis identiﬁed twomodes of binding between the two proteins . First we noted that the extreme C terminus of RME - 1 , just after the EH domain , contains a tyrosine - proline - X - leucine ( YPSL ) motif , similar to that used by mammalian Alix to bind to retroviral Gag proteins [ 37 ] and that used by Aspergillus PalA to bind to PacC [ 21 ] . The central region of ALX - 1 from amino acids 365 – 752 was sufﬁcient to mediate the interaction , and the deletion of the ﬁnal nine amino acidsofRME - 1includingtheYPSLsequencecompletely abrogated the interaction . In addition , we noted that the extreme C terminus of ALX - 1 contains an asparagine - proline - phenylalanine tripeptide motif . The EH domain of RME - 1 homologs , and other EH - domain proteins , are known to bind to NPF - containing sequences [ 32 , 35 ] . The deletion of the NPF sequence in the context of the yeast two - hybrid prey construct reduced the RME - 1 / ALX - 1 interaction by almost 3 - fold but did not com - pletely block association ( Figure 1 ) . The Bro1 domain of ALX - 1 was dispensable for the two - hybrid interaction . Taken together , these results suggest that the central domain of ALX - 1 contributes the main binding surface , interacting with the C terminus of RME - 1 through the YPSL - containing tail , whereas the NPF sequence of ALX - 1 interacts with the RME - 1 EH domain , perhaps modulating the interactions . ALX - 1 Is Broadly Expressed in C . elegans To determine what tissues express ALX - 1 and are thus cell types in which ALX - 1 might interact with RME - 1 in vivo , we created transgenic animals expressing a GFP - ALX - 1 ( GFP : green ﬂuorescent protein ) translational fusion gene driven by the alx - 1 promoter ( see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) . We observed ubiquitous expression of GFP - ALX - 1 with notably high levels of expression in the intestine , hypodermis , body - wall muscles , nervous system , spermatheca , coe - lomocytes , and pharynx ( Figures 2A – 2F ) . The GFP - ALX - 1 fusion protein appeared punctate in most tissues . In the intestine , GFP - ALX - 1 was enriched near the apical plasma membrane ( PM ) and was also clearly enriched on distinct cytoplasmic puncta ( Figure 2A , arrowheads ) . Intestine - speciﬁc expression of equivalent fusions of ALX - 1 to GFP or mCherry produced indistinguishable subcellular localization patterns and rescued alx - 1 mu - tant phenotypes ( see below and the Supplemental Ex - perimental Procedures ) , indicating that the expression Figure 1 . RME - 1 Interacts with ALX - 1 Quantitative yeast two - hybrid b - galactosidase ( b - gal ) assays show that the ALX - 1 C - terminal NPF motif contributes to the interaction with RME - 1 , whereas the central domain ( aa 365 – 752 ) of ALX - 1 con - tributesthemainbinding surface , interactingwithRME - 1throughits C - terminal YPSL sequence .

ALX - 1 Is Associated with Recycling Endosomes and MVEs in the Intestine Because RME - 1 and its mammalian homologs have not been found localized to MVEs and are not required for membrane protein degradation but rather are greatly enriched on recycling endosomes and function in recy - cling , we sought to determine whether ALX - 1 protein is present on recycling endosomes . First , we compared the subcellular localization of intestinally expressed mCherry - ALX - 1 with GFP - RME - 1 , which is found on basolateral recycling endosomes [ 30 , 38 ] . mCherry - ALX - 1 colocalized extensively with GFP - RME - 1 ( Figures 3A – 3C ) . Puncta positive for mCherry - ALX - 1 and GFP - RME - 1 were more frequent close to the basolateral PM and are best observed in the top focal plane ( Figures 3A – 3C ; Figures S2A – S2D ) . Fewer ALX - 1 and RME - 1 double - positive structures were found in the middle focal planes , which offer better views of the medial and apical membranes . These results indicated that ALX - 1 is present on basolateral recycling endosomes , where it could interact with RME - 1 to regulate recycling . Our results also indicated that ALX - 1 is present on other unidentiﬁed structures in the intestine . We obtained identical results with the ﬂuorescent tags reversed , comparing GFP - ALX - 1 with mCherry - RME - 1 . Because mammalian Alix and yeast Bro1p are thought to be associated with MVEs , we also compared the localizationofmCherry - ALX - 1withGFP - taggedHGRS - 1 [ 39 , 40 ] , the worm ortholog of the MVE protein Hrs / Vps27p . GFP - HGRS - 1 mainly colocalized with mCherry - ALX - 1 on puncta of the medial and apical cyto - plasm ( Figures 3D – 3F , arrowheads ; Figures S2E – S2H ) . These results suggest that ALX - 1 is present on MVEs in addition to recycling endosomes . We conﬁrmed that the RME - 1 - labeled recycling endosomes and the HGRS - 1 - labeled MVEs are independent vesicle popula - tions by directly comparing the subcellular localization of GFP - HGRS - 1 and mCherry - RME - 1 . We did not observe any colocalization between GFP - HGRS - 1 - and mCherry - RME - 1 - labeled puncta , substantiating this inference ( Figures 3G – 3I ) . We also compared mCherry - ALX - 1 with markers for early endosomes ( GFP - RAB - 5 ) , late endosomes ( GFP - RAB - 7 ) , and TGN and apical recycling endosomes ( GFP - RAB - 11 ) ( Figure S3 ) . We observed the occasional colocalization of mCherry - ALX - 1 with the early - endo - some marker GFP - RAB - 5 and did not observe colocali - zation with the TGN / ARE marker . mCherry - ALX - 1 did not clearly label the large ring - like GFP - RAB - 7 - positive Figure 2 .

ALX - 1 in Endocytic Recycling 1915 late endosomes , but some mCherry - ALX - 1 puncta appeared on or near the rings . The weak colocalization with early - and late - endosome markers is consistent with the presence of ALX - 1 on MVEs because MVEs represent an intermediate in the maturation of early endosomes to late endosomes . Taken together , our results indicate that ALX - 1 resides on two independent classes of endosomes in the worm intestine , where it could potentially contribute to membrane trafﬁc . ALX - 1 - Positive Structure Number Increases in rme - 1 Mutants As an additional test of the association of ALX - 1 with recycling endosomes , we quantiﬁed the number of GFP - ALX - 1 - positive puncta in an rme - 1 ( b1045 ) null mu - tant background . For comparison , we also assayed GFP - HGRS - 1 , which is expected to label MVEs but not recycling endosomes . We previously established that rme - 1 mutant intestines speciﬁcally accumulate abnormally high numbers of basolateral recycling endo - somes but do not accumulate increased numbers of early , late , or apical recycling endosomes [ 38 ] . Thus , if ALX - 1 is associated with basolateral recycling endo - somes , we would expect to observe an increase in GFP - ALX - 1 puncta number . rme - 1 null mutant intestines showed a nearly 3 - fold increase in GFP - ALX - 1 puncta number but no change in GFP - HGRS - 1 puncta number ( Figures 4B and 4C ; Figure S4 ) . These results are entirely consistent with residence of ALX - 1 on basolateral recy - cling endosomes . These results also indicate that ALX - 1 association with such endosomes does not require RME - 1 . Loss of ALX - 1 Results in Intracellular Accumulation of Recycling Cargo Given the physical association and colocalization of ALX - 1 and RME - 1 , we sought to determine whether the loss of ALX - 1 affects basolateral recycling .

Signals observed in the green or red channels that do not overlap with signals in the blue channel are considered bona ﬁde GFP or mCherry signals , respectively . The scale bar represents 5 m m . Current Biology Vol 17 No 22 1916 this end , we obtained a deletion allele of alx - 1 , gk275 , created by the C . elegans Gene Knockout Consortium . This mutation deletes the ﬁrst exon and part of the sec - ond exon and is not predicted to produce any functional ALX - 1 protein . alx - 1 ( gk275 ) mutants are viable and at the gross organismal level appeared fairly normal , simi - lar to rme - 1 mutants and several other endocytic traf - ﬁcking mutants that we have previously examined . As a ﬁrst step to determine whether alx - 1 is required for basolateral recycling , we assayed the localization of basolaterally recycling transmembrane cargo pro - teins at steady state , comparing wild - type animals with alx - 1 ( gk275 ) mutant animals . Equivalent GFP fusions for these cargo proteins have previously been shown to be functional and trafﬁc normally in mammalian cells , and we have previously characterized them in the C . elegans intestine [ 38 ] . First , we assayed for effects on the localization of the a chain of the human interleu - kin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) receptor TAC ( hTAC - GFP ) , which is a marker for clathrin - independent uptake and rme - 1 - dependent recycling in mammalian cells [ 5 , 41 ] and which we have previously shown accumulates extensively in aberrant endosomes in C . elegans rme - 1 mutants [ 38 ] . We observed signiﬁcant aberrant accumulation of hTAC - GFP in cytoplasmic puncta in alx - 1 mutant intestines . hTAC - GFP puncta number was increased by 3 - fold in alx - 1 mutants compared to wild - type controls ( Figures 5C , 5D , and 5E ) . These results suggest that the recycling of clathrin - independent cargo requires ALX - 1 . We then assayed the human transferrin receptor ( hTfR - GFP ) , whichisamarkerforclathrin - dependentup - take and rme - 1 - dependent recycling in mammalian cells [ 31 , 42 , 43 ] . We have previously shown that hTfR - GFP accumulates in aberrant endosomes in C . elegans rme - 1 mutants but not as extensively as hTAC - GFP [ 38 ] . We could not detect any changes in localization for hTfR - GFP ( Figures 5A and 5B ) , suggesting that clathrin - dependent cargo recycles normally in the absence of ALX - 1 . In order to determine whether human Alix is also required for the recycling of clathrin - independent cargo , we analyzed major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I recycling in HeLa cells by using a previously established pulse - chase assay that follows a non - perturbing anti - MHC class I monoclonal antibody [ 44 ] . MHC class I is a well documented marker for clathrin - independent uptake and Ehd1 / mRme - 1 - dependent recycling in mammalian cells [ 41 , 45 ] . Cells transfected with an mRFP1 control vector were compared to cells cotransfected with mRFP1 and a FLAG - tagged domi - nant negative form of Alix ( Alix - CT [ CT : carboxy termi - nal ] , amino acids 467 – 869 ) [ 46 ] . MHC class I uptake was similar between mRFP1 - transfected ( RFP : red ﬂuorescent protein ) cells and mRFP1 / FLAG - Alix ( 467 – 869 ) cotransfected cells ( Fig - ures 5F , 5G , and 5J ) . MHC class I recycling in mRFP1 / FLAG - Alix ( 467 – 869 ) cotransfected cells was reduced by12 - foldcomparedtocontrol mRFP1 - transfectedcells ( Figures 5H , 5I , and 5K ) , suggesting that the requirement for Alix / ALX - 1 in this recycling pathway is conserved from worms to mammals . We also analyzed clathrin - dependent cargo transfer - rin ( Tf ) uptake and recycling in HeLa cells by using a previously described assay [ 47 ] . EGFP / FLAG - Alix ( 467 – 869 ) cotransfected cells showed slightly reduced , but not statistically different , Alexa568 - Tf uptake ( 84 . 4 % 6 9 . 8 % of control , p = 0 . 055 ) when compared to control cells transfected with EGFP control plasmid Figure 4 . rme - 1 Mutants Accumulate Abnor - mally Numerous GFP - ALX - 1 - Labeled Endo - somes ( A and B ) Confocal images of wild - type ani - mals ( A ) and rme - 1 ( b1045 ) mutant animals ( B ) showing GFP - ALX - 1 - labeled endosomes in the intestine .

To further analyze the effect of the alx - 1 knockout on recycling - endosome number and size , we quantiﬁed the number of GFP - RME - 1 - labeled endosomes in alx - 1 mutants . In wild - type animals , GFP - RME - 1 strongly labels endosomes very near the basolateral PM ( Figure 6A ) . GFP - RME - 1 also weakly labels structures very near the apical PM that could be apical recycling endosomes [ 38 ] . In alx - 1 mutants , an abnormally large number of GFP - RME - 1 - labeled endosomes accumulated , most notably ap - pearing in large numbers throughout the cytoplasm in addition to the normally localized cortical structures ( Figure 6B ) . Image quantitation revealed an approxi - mately 3 - fold increase in GFP - RME - 1 puncta number and size ( Figures 6I and 6J ) . No defects were found in the localization of an apical recycling - endosome - and TGN - associated marker , GFP - RAB - 11 , in the intestine of alx - 1 mutants ( Figure S5 ) . These results suggest that ALX - 1 is important for the normal function of RME - 1 - positive basolateral recycling endosomes and taken together with the effects on hTAC - GFP accumu - lation in worms , and MHC class I recycling in HeLa cells , suggest that ALX - 1 / Alix is important for the efﬁ - cient export of certain cargo proteins from recycling en - dosomes . These results also indicate that ALX - 1 is not required for the association of RME - 1 with endosomes , suggesting that ALX - 1 affects RME - 1 function rather than its recruitment . Figure 6 .

ALX - 1 in Endocytic Recycling 1919 SDPN - 1 Recruitment to Basolateral Endosomes Fails in alx - 1 Mutants The F - Bar and SH3 domain protein syndapin is a regula - tor of endocytic transport and actin dynamics . Previous work in HeLa cells showed that syndapin is a binding partner of mammalian Ehd1 / mRme - 1 on recycling endo - somes and functions with Ehd1 / mRme - 1 in recycling [ 36 ] . This lead us to test whether syndapin is also involved in the basolateral recycling pathway described here . C . elegans has a single ortholog of syndapin , called SDPN - 1 , and we found that SDPN - 1 - GFP ex - pressed from its own promoter is highly expressed in the intestine and colocalizes with RME - 1 on basolateral recycling endosomes ( data not shown ) . Further analysis showed that alx - 1 mutants lack SDPN - 1 on basolateral structures , implying an inability to recruit SDPN - 1 to basolateral endosomes ( Figures 7B and 7H ) . In rme - 1 mutants , basolateral SDPN - 1 - GFP - labeled structures were also signiﬁcantly altered , characterized by loss of most basolateral SDPN - 1 - GFP - labeled structures and with many of the remaining structures appearing greatly enlarged ( Figures 7C and 7F ) . alx - 1 mutant animals de - pleted of RME - 1 by RNA interference ( RNAi ) displayed a mixed phenotype , with weaker SDPN - 1 - GFP labeling of endosomes that appeared to be enlarged , but less enlarged than in animals lacking RME - 1 only ( Figures 7C and 7D ) . Apical SDPN - 1 appeared normally localized in alx - 1 and rme - 1 mutants . Because syndapin regulates membrane - associated actin dynamics and promotes membrane tubulation , the failure of basolateral recycling endosomes to recruit SDPN - 1 to basolateral recycling endosomes might be the primary defect resulting in intracellular accumulation of recycling cargo in alx - 1 mutants . MVE and Late - Endosome Morphology Is Aberrant in alx - 1 Mutants Analysis in early embryos indicated that ALX - 1 is re - quired for the degradation of integral membrane proteins ( see the Supplemental Results and Figures S6A – S6D ) , a process that does not require RME - 1 but does require ESCRT proteins [ 48 ] . To assay for changes in the MVE and / or late - endosome pathway in the intes - tine , we performed endosome morphometric analysis of alx - 1 mutant animals . We did not observe any effect of the loss of ALX - 1 on RAB - 5 - positive early - endosome number or size ( Figure S5 ) . Consistent with a role for ALX - 1 in intestinal MVE function , we found a 2 - fold increase in MVE number and size in alx - 1 mutants in GFP - HGRS - 1 - expressing strains ( Figures 6D , 6I , and 6J ) . We also observed a dramatic effect on GFP - RAB - 7 - and LMP - 1 - GFP - positive late endosomes , which accumulated in normal numbers but which displayed grossly abnormal morphology ( Figures 6F and 6H ) , with an average 5 - fold increase in late - endosome size ( Figure 6J ) . Consistent with our cargo analysis in alx - 1 mutant embryos , these results indicate that MVE and late - endosome morphology , and likely their functions , require ALX - 1 in vivo . Basolateral Recycling Endosomes Require the Interaction of RME - 1 with ALX - 1 Finally , we sought to speciﬁcally test the role of the RME - 1 / ALX - 1 interaction in transport , as opposed to the roles of the individual proteins . We accomplished this by reintroducing interaction - defective forms of RME - 1 or ALX - 1 into their cognate null mutants and assaying for rescue of the loss - of - function phenotypes . Our yeast two - hybrid studies indicated that RME - 1 C - terminal tail containing the YPSL motif is required for RME - 1 to bind to ALX - 1 . To determine the impor - tance of the YPSL tail in vivo and the contribution of ALX - 1 binding to RME - 1 function , we tested the ability of mCherry - RME - 1 lacking the YPSL tail ( mCherry - RME - 1 D YPSL ) to rescue rme - 1 ( b1045 ) mutants . The expression of mCherry - RME - 1 ( + ) or mCherry - RME - 1 ( D YPSL ) in rme - 1 null mutants fully rescued the forma - tion of abnormal recycling endosome ( RE ) vacuoles containing accumulated basolaterally recycling ﬂuid ( Figure 7E ) , indicating that the interaction of RME - 1 with ALX - 1 is not required for ﬂuid recycling . In stark contrast , we found that the expression of mCherry - RME - 1 ( + ) , but not mCherry - RME - 1 ( D YPSL ) , rescued the abnormal intracellular accumulation of hTAC - GFP and the abnormal localization and / or morphology of GFP - SDPN - 1 ( Figure 7F ; Figure S7 ) . The failure of mCherry - RME - 1 ( D YPSL ) to rescue these phenotypes suggests that RME - 1’s function in SDPN - 1 recruitment and hTAC recycling requires interaction with ALX - 1 . In a similar set of experiments , we compared the ability of mCherry - ALX - 1 or mCherry - ALX - 1 lacking the C - terminal NPF tripeptide ( mCherry - ALX - 1 D NPF ) to res - cue alx - 1 mutant phenotypes . Interestingly , we found that mCherry - ALX - 1 ( D NPF ) fully rescued alx - 1 ( gk275 ) phenotypes associated with MVEs and late endosomes , including the abnormal increase in the number of GFP - HGRS - 1 - labeled endosomes and the size and / or mor - phology defects in LMP - 1 - GFP - labeled late endosomes ( Figures 7G and 7H ; Figure S8 ) . These results further conﬁrm that RME - 1 is not required for these functions of ALX - 1 . By contrast , mCherry - ALX - 1 ( D NPF ) could not rescue the recycling associated phenotypes of alx - 1 mutants , including hTAC - GFP accumulation or basolateral recruitment of GFP - SDPN - 1 ( Figure 7H ; Figure S8 ) . As expected , mCherry - ALX - 1 ( + ) rescued both the MVE - and / or late - endosome - and RE - associ - ated phenotypes of alx - 1 mutants ( Figures 7G and 7H ; Figure S8 ) . These results genetically separate the functions of ALX - 1 , indicating that the effects of alx - 1 mutants on hTAC and SDPN - 1 are through RME - 1 on recycling endosomes and are not indirect effects pro - duced by defective MVEs or late endosomes . Discussion In thisstudy , we show for the ﬁrst time that an Alix / Bro1p family member functions in the endocytic recycling pathway , in association with the recycling endosome regulator RME - 1 . We also show that ALX - 1 is required for the degradation of membrane proteins in C . elegans , likely functioning with the ESCRT machinery in the multi - vesicular endosome , as is thought to be the case for other members of the Alix / Bro1p family [ 7 ] . Consistent with our previous studies showing that RME - 1 does not function in early or late endosomes , we found that RME - 1 does not colocalize with HGRS - 1 - positive MVEs in the intestine , and rme - 1 null mutants display normal degradation of membrane proteins in early Current Biology Vol 17 No 22 1920 Figure 7 .

( E – H ) Rescue experiments genetically separate ALX - 1 functions andindicatearequirementfor the ALX - 1 / RME - 1 interaction in vivo . Interaction - defective mutant forms of RME - 1 ( D YPSL ) or ALX - 1 ( D NPF ) , expressed asmCherry ( MC ) fusions , were comparedto wild - type formsintheir abil - ity to rescue speciﬁc rme - 1 ( b1045 ) or alx - 1 ( gk275 ) mutant phenotypes in the intestine . One set of phenotypes that was assayed focused on recycling endosomes : the abnormal accumulation of basolaterally recycling pseudocoelomic ﬂuid in enlarged vacuoles - REs , intracellular recy - cling cargo hTAC - GFP accumulation , andbasolateral SDPN - 1 - GFP recruitment and / or morphology . In addition , ALX - 1 ( D NPF ) was compared to intactALX - 1initsabilitytorescue alx - 1 mutant - associateddefectsinthedegradativepathway : multivesicularendosomenumber , asassayedby GFP - HGRS - 1 , and late - endosome size , as assayed by LMP - 1 - GFP .

Error bars represent the standard deviations from the mean ( n = 10 each ) .

Note that wild - type MC - RME - 1 rescues both defects , whereas MC - RME - 1 ( D YPSL ) cannot rescue the rme - 1 ( b1045 ) - associated defects . ( G and H ) The last two bars in each graph show the relative degree of rescue of alx - 1 ( gk275 ) mutant defects achieved by expression of MC - tagged ALX - 1 or MC - tagged ALX - 1 ( D NPF ) . Note that wild - type MC - ALX - 1 rescues all defects , whereas MC - ALX - 1 ( D NPF ) can only rescue alx - 1 - associated phenotypes of the degradative pathway , LMP - 1 - GFP endosome size ( G ) , and GFP - HGRS - 1 puncta number ( H ) but cannot rescue phenotypes associated with the recycling pathway , hTAC - GFP , and SDPN - 1 - GFP puncta number ( H ) . Asterisks indicate a signiﬁcant difference in the one - tailed Student’s t test ( p < 0 . 01 ) . ALX - 1 in Endocytic Recycling 1921 embryos . In addition , rme - 1 mutants display normal HGRS - 1 - labeled MVE morphology and number in the in - testine . Thus , our studies indicate a dual requirement for ALX - 1 in both the recycling and degradative pathways , whereas RME - 1 is speciﬁc for recycling . Previous studies indicated that mammalian Alix facili - tates virus budding from the plasma membrane of in - fected cells through direct binding to the sequence motif YPXL within viral Gag protein late - budding domains [ 18 – 20 ] . Similarly , the Aspergillus Alix / Bro1p homolog PalA interacts with its partner protein PacC through YPXL motifs [ 21 ] . Our studies indicate an important interaction between the central region of ALX - 1 and a C - terminal YPSL sequence in RME - 1 . In addition , the C - terminal NPF sequence in ALX - 1 contributes to the interaction between ALX - 1 and RME - 1 , presumably through the NPF - binding pocket present in the EH domain . The NPF - mediated interaction between ALX - 1 and RME - 1 is required for the function of ALX - 1 in recycling but appears to be dispensable for ALX - 1 function in MVEs and / or late endosomes . This genetic separation of the two functions of ALX - 1 indicates mechanistic differ - ences between ALX - 1’s roles in these two aspects of endocytic transport . Consistent with a dual function for ALX - 1 in vivo , we found evidence for ALX - 1 localization to both types of endocytic organelles , the HGRS - 1 - positive MVE and the RME - 1 - positive recycling endosomes . Interestingly , recent studies in human T cells and macrophages using quantitative electron microscopy ( EM ) methods re - vealed an enrichment of endogenous human Alix on tubular - vesicular endosomal membranes containing transferrin , consistent with the residence of human Alix on recycling endosomes [ 49 ] . Alix siRNA in HeLa cells was reported not to affect transferrin recycling but did affect endosome morphology [ 25 ] . In this study , we found that the expression of dominant - negative Alix in HeLa cells dramatically interfered with MHC class I recy - cling but did not signiﬁcantly affect transferrin recycling , suggesting that the role of Alix in recycling cargo endo - cytosed independently of clathrin is a conserved func - tion . We note , however , that the interaction sites that we identiﬁed between C . elegans RME - 1 and ALX - 1 do not seem to be conserved in their human homologs . Similarly , although human syndapin binds to Ehd1 / mRme - 1 directly , and worm SDPN - 1 appears to function with RME - 1 in recycling , the NPF - containing sequences in syndapin I and II recognized by Ehd1 are lacking in Ce - SDPN - 1 . Thus , although our results suggest that these proteins function together in worms and mam - mals , the binding modes among those proteins might have been shufﬂed during metazoan evolution . In yeast , the ALX - 1 homolog Bro1p is required at the limiting membrane of specialized MVEs [ 7 ] for the sorting of monoubiquitinated membrane proteins into lumenalvesiclesandproductive transportto thevacuole [ 8 ] . However , some controversy remains over the requirement for Alix in MVE - mediated degradation of membrane proteins because Alix - depleted HeLa cells were not delayed in the degradation of EGF receptors [ 25 ] . Alix is clearly required for the budding of retrovi - ruses in mammals , another transport process that utilizes the MVE / ESCRT machinery [ 12 , 18 – 20 ] . In C . el - egans alx - 1 mutants , we observed defects in intestinal MVE and / or late - endosome morphology and a very sig - niﬁcant delay in the degradation of endocytosed mem - brane proteins CAV - 1 - GFP and RME - 2 - GFP in embryos , indicating the conservation of this function in nema - todes . Consistent with our results , Shaye and Green - wald [ 50 ] reported that the degradation of LIN - 12 / Notch receptors in vulval precursor cells is delayed in animals depleted of ALX - 1 by RNAi methods . Although there are no previously known mechanistic links between the degradative and recycling branches of the endocytic pathway , it might be advantageous for the cell to coordi - nate transport through multiple branches in the path - way , perhaps allowing a coordinated response to changes in cargo type , overall cargo load , and / or the local cellular environment . Although RME - 1 / mRme - 1 / Ehd1 isrequired fortheefﬁ - cient recycling of cargo internalized by clathrin - depen - dent and clathrin - independent mechanisms [ 30 , 31 , 38 , 41 ] , ourresultssuggestthatALX - 1isspeciﬁcallyrequired to recycle cargo of the clathrin - independent class . Con - sistent with this functional difference , not all basolateral RME - 1 - positive structures appear positive for ALX - 1 . Also , basolateral ﬂuid recycling , which can probably uti - lize either RME - 1 - dependent recycling pathway , does not appear to require the RME - 1 / ALX - 1 interaction . Although the mechanisms controlling the recycling of clathrin - independent cargo remain poorly deﬁned , it is clear that local actin dynamics on endosomal mem - branes are important for productive transport of such cargo from recycling endosomes to the plasma mem - brane . For instance the inhibition of actin polymerization with drugs such as latrunculin A or cytochalasin D spe - ciﬁcallydisruptsrecycling ofclathrin - independent cargo in HeLa cells such as MHC class I and Tac , whereas un - der the same conditions , the clathrin - dependent cargo transferrin recycles normally [ 44 , 51 , 52 ] . Likewise , the membrane - associated actin regulator Arf6 is required to recycle clathrin - independent but not clathrin - depen - dent cargos [ 5 ] . Interestingly , the knockdown of Alix in HeLa cells is known to perturb intracellular actin distri - bution , and Alix has been reported to copurify with cyto - skeleton components , suggesting a possible functional link between Alix family proteins and membrane - associ - ated actin dynamics [ 23 – 25 ] . Syndapin is known to facilitate the recruitment of N - WASP to membranes , thus activating Arp2 / 3 - directed actin branching and polymerization [ 53 , 54 ] . We found that alx - 1 mutants showed greatly reduced recruitment of SDPN - 1 / synda - pin to basolateral endosomes , suggesting that ALX - 1 promotes recycling through SDPN - 1 / syndapin and pos - sibly N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 machinery . Because actin dynamics are thought to promote vesicle scission at the plasma membrane of yeast and mammalian cells , RME - 1 , ALX - 1 , and SDPN - 1 might act in a similar way to promote endosomal carrier scission .
