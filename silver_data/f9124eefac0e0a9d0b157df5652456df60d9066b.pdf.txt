Over the last years , quantita - tive afﬁnity puriﬁcation followed by mass spectrometry ( q - AP - MS ) has become a powerful approach to investigate PPIs in an unbiased manner . In q - AP - MS the protein of interest is biochemically enriched together with its interaction partners . In parallel , a control experiment is performed to control for non - speciﬁc binding . Quantitative mass spectrometry is then employed to compare protein levels in both samples and to exclude non - speciﬁc contaminants . Here , we provide two detailed q - AP - MS protocols for pull - downs with immobilized bait proteins or transient transfection of tagged expression constructs . We discuss beneﬁts and limitations of q - AP - MS and highlight critical parameters that need to be considered .

While some interactions are binary , other cellu - lar events involve large multi - protein complexes . Identifying and characterizing protein – protein interactions ( PPIs ) is crucial to gain molecular insights into cell function and physiology . Importantly , PPIs are frequently regulated in response to a speciﬁc stimulus or cell state [ 1 , 2 ] . It is therefore important to identify binding part - ners of a protein in its speciﬁc cellular context . An ideal system for detecting PPIs would take the cellular background into account , work with endogenous levels of the protein of interest and have both a high sensitivity ( i . e . low false - negative rate ) and speciﬁcity ( i . e . low false - positive rate ) . One of the most popular methods of studying PPIs is the yeast - two - hybrid ( Y2H ) approach [ 3 ] . A great advantage of this system is that it is scalable and can be used to identify many PPIs in rela - tively short time . However , the Y2H method provides only a static picture and cannot yield immediate clues about the cellular pro - cesses that convert genetic information into complex phenotypes [ 4 ] . Other disadvantages are caused by using yeast as a heterolo - gous system . For example , mammalian proteins expressed in yeast may not carry all post - translational modiﬁcations relevant for their function . This is especially problematic since PPIs are often regu - lated by reversible modiﬁcations such as phosphorylation [ 1 , 5 ] . These and other factors contribute to the notorious high false - positive and false - negative rate of the assay . An attractive alternative to Y2H is afﬁnity puriﬁcation followed by mass spectrometry or AP - MS ( see [ 6 ] for an excellent review ) . Thegeneralprincipleisthataproteinofinterestispuriﬁedbiochem - ically from an appropriate biological sample . In most cases tissue culture cells are employed but in vivo samples such as whole organs can also be used . After puriﬁcation , mass spectrometry - based pro - teomics [ 7 , 8 ] identiﬁes the proteins in the sample . This list of iden - tiﬁed proteins is expected to contain the protein of interest and its cellularinteractionpartners . AP - MSdetectsPPIsamongproteinsde - rived from their native cellular environment that carry all relevant post - translational modiﬁcations . The method reveals the composi - tion of entire protein complexes and thus potentially the function of large molecular machines . When combined with quantiﬁcation , the method can also uncover dynamic changes in PPIs and thereby directly provide information about cell signaling . The biggest challenge in AP - MS experiments is to distinguish between true interaction partners and co - purifying contaminants . One way to alleviate this problem is tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation ( TAP ) . In this method , tagged bait proteins are puriﬁed by two suc - cessive puriﬁcation steps in order to reduce the non - speciﬁc back - ground binders [ 9 ] . Although the TAP method is still widely used it has considerable disadvantages . Most importantly , due to the in - creased sensitivity of mass spectrometers it is impossible to re - move contaminants completely . Furthermore , two successive stringent puriﬁcation steps can also remove biologically important but weak or substoichiometric interactors . Thus , TAP suffers from a trade - off between speciﬁcity and sensitivity . 1046 - 2023 / $ - see front matter (cid:2) 2011 Elsevier Inc .

Methods 54 ( 2011 ) 387 – 395 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Methods journal homepage : www . elsevier . com / locate / ymeth The best way of distinguishing true interaction partners from non - speciﬁc contaminants available to date is to use quantitative proteomics . This strategy is based on comparing the abundance of proteins identiﬁed in the sample with a suitable control . The general idea is to perform two experiments in parallel : In addition to the afﬁnity puriﬁcation of the protein of interest a control exper - iment is performed that is not expected to yield any interaction partners . Quantitative mass spectrometry can then be used to com - pare the abundance of proteins in both pull - downs . True interac - tion partners are more abundant in the actual AP - MS sample compared to the control . In contrast , non - speciﬁc contaminants have a 1 : 1 ratio since they are equally abundant in both pull - downs . In this way , quantiﬁcation circumvents the trade - off be - tween sensitivity and speciﬁcity and can conﬁdently identify PPIs even under low stringency conditions . Quantitative AP - MS ( q - AP - MS ) experiments have been em - ployed successfully in different ways to address a wide range of biological questions [ 10 – 20 ] . A detailed discussion of this work is beyond the scope of this manuscript , see [ 21 ] for an excellent re - view . Here , we describe two strategies of how q - AP - MS can be used to detect PPIs ( Fig . 1 ) . Both methods are generic and can be em - ployed to a broad spectrum of biological questions . We provide both step - by - step protocols and background information to allow researchers adapting the workﬂow to their speciﬁc experimental system . We begin with a discussion of general considerations important for any q - AP - MS experiment . 2 . General considerations 2 . 1 . Exogenous or endogenous bait ? The gold - standard assay for PPIs is still the co - immunoprecipi - tation ( coIP ) of untagged proteins at their endogenous level . The only available screening method based on this assay is quantitative immunoprecipitation combined with knock - down ( QUICK ) [ 14 ] . In QUICK , the protein of interest is knocked - down by RNA interfer - ence in control cells but not in cells used for the real coIP . The pro - tein of interest is then precipitated from both samples . The target protein itself and its interaction partners are more abundant in the real coIP compared to the control and can thus be identiﬁed . QUICK assesses interactions between untagged endogenous pro - teins at their normal cellular levels within the appropriate cell type . It can therefore identify PPIs with very high conﬁdence . The disadvantage of QUICK is that antibodies are often not available . Therefore , we describe two alternative strategies based on tagged bait proteins that can be used even when bait - speciﬁc antibodies are not available . In the ﬁrst approach an exogenous bait is coupled to a matrix to ﬁsh - out interaction partners from cell lysates ( Fig . 1A ) . This approach is very ﬂexible and allows for the application of different types of baits . For example , recombinant proteins , synthetic peptides or other small molecules can be used [ 10 – 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 20 , 22 ] . Another interesting feature is that the bait can be used in modiﬁed forms to screen for modiﬁcation - speciﬁc interactions . For instance , differences in interaction partners of tyrosine - phosphorylated peptides and their non - modiﬁed versions can reveal phosphorylation - dependent interactions . In the exam - ple presented here we use GDP - versus GTP c S - loaded states of the small GTPase Cdc42 . The experiment is therefore designed to identify speciﬁc interaction partners of both the inactivated and the activated GTPase . In the second approach presented here the bait protein is ex - pressed in cell lines by transient transfection with an expression vector ( Fig . 1B ) . Bait proteins are fused to a biochemical tag to facil - itate puriﬁcation . A wide range of different tags is available with different advantages and disadvantages ( see Table 1 for an over - view and [ 23 ] for a detailed review ) . These tags differ in size , ranging from short peptide motifs to proteins of several kDa . Tags bind to different types of binding partners such as antibodies ( e . g . a - FLAG , a - HA ) , proteins ( e . g . streptavidin , calmodulin ) , or small molecules ( e . g . biotin , glutathione ) . Smaller tags may be advanta - geous since they are expected to interfere less with bait protein function . On the other hand , larger tags can help to increase the solubility of the bait protein which can facilitate subsequent puri - ﬁcation . Another important factor to consider is the afﬁnity of the interaction between the tag and its binding partner : The interac - tion must be strong enough to efﬁciently purify the bait from the lysate . Pull - downs with exogenous or transfected baits have unique strengths and weaknesses . Using exogenous baits uncouples bait production from the interaction experiment . Therefore , large amounts of cell lysates and bait proteins can be prepared in ad - vance and used for many experiments . Even cells which cannot be transfected efﬁciently can be used without restriction . However , it should be kept in mind that this assay may erroneously detect interactions among proteins that never co - localize in vivo . Trans - fected bait proteins have the advantage that they are produced in their native environment and in the correct subcellular location . An important caveat here is that overexpression of the bait protein might result in non - speciﬁc interactions . Expression systems based on bacterial artiﬁcial chromosomes ( BACs ) circumvent this prob - lem but are not available for all proteins of interest or speciﬁc vari - ants [ 13 ] . Irrespective of the method used it should always be kept in mind that tagging may alter protein function . Therefore , interac - tion partners should be veriﬁed by coIP with the endogenous pro - teins and / or functional follow - ups . 2 . 2 . Which method should be used for quantiﬁcation ? q - AP - MS depends on reliable quantiﬁcation of relative differ - ences in protein abundance between in the pull - down of interest and the control . Different methods allow for protein quantiﬁcation by mass spectrometry [ 24 , 25 ] . Some of these methods rely on sta - ble isotope labeling while others use computational approaches to obtain quantitative information from MS data ( i . e . label - free quan - tiﬁcation ) . In principle , any method can be used for q - AP - MS as long as it is accurate enough for unambiguous comparison of both samples . Stable isotope - based approaches are usually more precise than label - free approaches . For cell culture experiments , stable iso - tope labeling by amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC ) is both the easiest and most accurate stable isotope - based approach [ 26 , 27 ] . SILAC can now even be used to label model organisms like ﬂies and mice [ 28 , 29 ] . Therefore , SILAC is generally the method of choice for q - AP - MS experiments and also used in this protocol . Label - free quantiﬁcation has also been used recently for q - AP - MS and is the method of choice when SILAC is not possible [ 13 , 16 , 19 , 20 ] . However , care should be taken when selecting the algorithm for label - free quantiﬁcation . Although still popular , spectral counting provides only a very rough estimate of protein abundance and is thus error - prone [ 30 ] . Label - free algorithms based on pair - wise comparison of peptide peak intensities are more accurate and therefore preferable [ 13 ] . 2 . 3 . What is a suitable control ? q - AP - MS relies on comparing the abundance of proteins co - puriﬁed with the bait with a suitable control . This is a critical point since any change in protein abundance between the actual AP - MS sample and the control will be considered as a potential interaction partner . The choice of a suitable control depends a lot on the con - text of the experiment . In general , the closer the control resembles the actual experiment the better . For example , if the goal is to 388 F . E . Paul et al . / Methods 54 ( 2011 ) 387 – 395 identify proteins interacting with a modiﬁed peptide , the control should be the same peptide in the non - modiﬁed form . In case of endogenously expressed baits control cells should be transfected with the empty expression vector . In the latter case , the same afﬁn - ity matrix must be used for both the experiment and the control . This is important since different afﬁnity matrixes have different cross - reactivities . For example , different antibodies can cross - react with different cellular proteins . Therefore , a ‘‘control’’ antibody , A B Fig . 1 . Experimentalworkﬂowforquantitativeinteractionproteomics .

Eitherlightorheavy stable - isotope labeled cell lysate is incubated with tagged bait or control proteins , which has been crosslinked to the afﬁnity matrix . After the pull - down beads are mixed and captured bait / prey complexes are eluted and analyzed by LC - MS / MS . Crossover experiments are performed by swapping the lysate . ( B ) Scheme for afﬁnity puriﬁcation with endogenous expression of the bait protein . Stable - isotope labeled cells are transiently transfected with an expression plasmid encoding a bait or control protein with an appropriate tag .

F . E . Paul et al . / Methods 54 ( 2011 ) 387 – 395 389 even of the same isotype , is not a suitable control for an immuno - precipitation experiment . 2 . 4 . Should crosslinking be used ? The results of q - AP - MS experiments should reﬂect the composi - tion of endogenous protein complexes . This may , however , not be true in all cases : Although q - AP - MS captures transient interactions , very labile complexes may fall apart during puriﬁcation . Con - versely , PPIs may artiﬁcially form in a cell lysate between proteins that do not interact in vivo . The latter point is also the reason why even SILAC samples and their controls should generally be mixed after afﬁnity puriﬁcation [ 17 ] . Crosslinking offers the opportunity to ‘‘freeze’’ PPIs inside cells before lysis . The most popular cross - linker is formaldehyde : Due to its small size , formaldehyde can permeate cell walls and membranes and induce efﬁcient , revers - ible cross - links between proteins [ 31 ] . Crosslinking can also pro - vide structural information about proteins and PPIs , although this approach is challenging both technically and bioinformatically [ 32 ] . Due to these complications most q - AP - MS experiments are performed without crosslinking of the proteins in the lysate . A related question is whether or not the bait protein ( for exog - enous bait ) or the antibody ( for coIP ) should be crosslinked cova - lently to the afﬁnity matrix . Without crosslinking , the bait protein or antibody is often by far the most abundant protein in the puriﬁed sample . Since mass spectrometry is mainly limited by dynamic range , this may cause less abundant interaction part - ners to escape detection . Thus , it is generally recommended to crosslink the bait protein or the antibody to the afﬁnity matrix . For exogenous bait experiments we tested two alternatives : the homobifunctional crosslinker dimethyl pimelimidate ( DMP , [ 33 ] ) and N - Hydroxysuccinimide ( NHS ) activated Sepharose . Both cross - linkers clearly increased the number of identiﬁed interaction part - ners , showing that coupling baits to the matrix is indeed beneﬁcial ( see Fig . 2 and Section 4 . ) . Many anti - tag - antibodies can be Table 1 Peptide and protein afﬁnity tags commonly used in puriﬁcation of fusion proteins .

Pulldown of Cdc42 effector proteins is most efﬁcient with NHS - Sepharose . The pull - downs of recombinantly expressed and nucleotide - loaded Cdc42 - GTP c S and Cdc42 - GDP were carried out ina q - AP - MS experiment . Three experiments were performed , ﬁrst with glutathione beads without crosslinker , second with glutathi - one beads with DMP crosslinking and third with NHS - activated Sepharose . Effector proteins were pulled - down from SILAC labeled HeLa cell lysate . Depicted is the number of proteins known to interact with Cdc42 in the list of thirty identiﬁed proteins with the highest ratio . The highest amount of known effectors is recovered using the NHS - Sepharose approach . 390 F . E . Paul et al . / Methods 54 ( 2011 ) 387 – 395 purchased directly in a matrix - bound form . If crosslinked antibod - ies are not available , it is usually advisable to crosslink them to protein A or protein G Sepharose using DMP or another bifunc - tional crosslinker ( see [ 34 ] for a detailed overview of different crosslinkers ) . 2 . 5 . Which kind of biological replicates are advisory ? As for all biological experiments , replicates also increase conﬁ - dence in q - AP - MS experiments . In case of SILAC - based quantiﬁca - tion such a replicate is most conveniently performed as a so - called crossover experiment with swapped isotope labels ( Fig . 1 ) . Swap - ping the labels should result in reciprocal SILAC ratios for true interaction partners ( see Fig . 3 and Conclusions ) . In contrast , exog - enous contaminants such as proteins derived from fetal bovine ser - um are always unlabeled ( i . e . light ) and can thus easily be identiﬁed . For pull - down experiments with exogenous baits a crossover experiment can also control for differences in protein abundance in the cell lysates used for the experiment . Such differ - ences in cellular protein abundance could otherwise be misinter - preted as speciﬁc interactions . Since label - free quantiﬁcation is generally less accurate than SILAC replicates are even more impor - tant in this case . Label - free experiments should usually be per - formed at least in triplicates since this permits statistical tests like the Student’s t - test for reliable identiﬁcation of interaction partners [ 13 ] . 3 . Experimental protocols 3 . 1 . General remarks In this chapter , we describe a step - by - step procedure for the identiﬁcation of PPIs using either a pull - down with recombinant bait protein or a coIP with a transfected bait protein . We use either stable isotope - labeled HeLa or HEK293T cells but in principle other cell lines that are amenable to SILAC can be utilized as well . We also propose different cell lysis buffers ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) for each puriﬁcation protocol , but again , other lysis buffers with protease and phosphatase inhibitors can be used as well , if the conditions are not too denaturing and work efﬁciently for the protein of inter - est . A considerable practical advantage of q - AP - MS over tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation is that less material is needed . We routinely use the protocols described here to identify interaction partners from about 2 (cid:3) 10 7 cells using in - solution digests . However , if expression levels of bait protein in transient transfections are very low or if known interaction partners are missed the experiments can be scaled up by using more cells or bait protein . Another lim - iting factor is the dynamic range of protein concentrations in the precipitates . Therefore , a prefractionation step by SDS – PAGE can enhance identiﬁcation rates . Since only a fraction of the loaded protein amount is recovered during in - gel digestion [ 35 ] it is often advisable to prefractionate and scale up at the same time . In our experience , both protocols can be scaled up easily to ﬁve to ten 15 - cm plates per condition . 3 . 2 . Materials 3 . 2 . 1 .

Cell culture HeLa or HEK293T cells are cultivated at 37 (cid:3) C with 5 % CO 2 and split every second or third day . SILAC media is essentially prepared as described [ 26 ] . Brieﬂy , DMEM lacking arginine and lysine is sup - plemented with 10 % dialyzed fetal bovine serum , 4 mM glutamine and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . To prepare heavy ( H ) SILAC media we add 28 mg / l 13 C 6 15 N 4 L - arginine plus 49 mg / l 13 C 6 15 N 2 L - lysine . Light ( L ) SILAC medium is prepared by adding the corresponding non - labeled amino acids . F . E . Paul et al . / Methods 54 ( 2011 ) 387 – 395 391 HeLa or HEK293T cells are labeled in the corresponding SILAC medium for at least seven cell divisions . For one quantitative immunoprecipitation , usually one 15 cm dish of light and heavy cells , respectively , is sufﬁcient ( 2 (cid:3) 10 7 cells of each SILAC state ) . 3 . 4 . Exogenous expression of bait protein followed by pull - down N - Hydroxysuccinimides ( NHS ) are activated esters which react with amine groups to amides . The following protocol is based on the standard protocol for NHS - activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow ( GE Healthcare ) . The recombinant protein should not be stored in solutions containing primary amines ( e . g . Tris - or ammonium - based buffers ) because they will react with NHS and decrease available binding sites . The protocol describes a single pull - down , with a respective amount of 100 – 150 l g of recombinant protein and 100 l l NHS - resin . The NHS protocol can also be performed for immunoprecipitations using 30 l l NHS - Sepharose and 5 – 10 l g of antibody . A complete quantitative q - AP - MS experiment requires 4 pull - downs ( 2 for the actual experiment and 2 for the crossover experiment ) . Optimal ratios of slurry to antibody to lysate are dependent on the protein used and should be experi - mentally titrated . Notes of volumes refer to the initial amount of slurry ( e . g . ‘4 vol - umes’ for an initial volume of 30 l l slurry means 120 l l ) . To avoid hydrolysis of the activated ester all steps preceding coupling should be performed without delays . 3 . 4 . 1 .

( F ) The unlabeled serum protein hemoglobin shows very low heavy - to - light ratios in both experimental conditions , indicating an non - speciﬁc contamination derived from serum . 392 F . E . Paul et al . / Methods 54 ( 2011 ) 387 – 395 additional washing steps . The pH should not be acidic to avoid denaturation of the recombinant protein . The pH can range be - tween 6 – 9 , higher pH will result in hydrolysis of the ester bound . 3 . 4 . 3 . Crosslinking Mix the recombinant protein ( or antibody ) with coupling buffer to a ﬁnal volume of 0 . 5 vol and add the solution to the slurry . Beads should always stay wet and be able to freely move within the dis - persion . If beads tend to dry add coupling buffer ( optimal ratio cou - pling solution : medium is 0 . 5 : 1 ) . Incubate by head over tail rotation for 120 min at room temperature . 3 . 4 . 4 . Quenching Centrifuge and remove the supernatant . Take a sample of the supernatant and check for binding efﬁciency via western blot . Add 2 . 5 vol quenching buffer . Incubate for 30 min at room temper - ature by head over tail rotation . Quenching is needed to saturate free binding sites . 3 . 4 . 5 . Wash cycles Centrifuge and remove the supernatant . Wash with alternating wash buffers to remove not covalently coupled bait protein . To use a low and a high pH buffer has proven to be practical . Repeat this step three times . Finally wash twice with at least 4 vol lysis buffer . The afﬁnity matrix is ready for use after this step . For storage add ethanol ( 20 % ) or azide and store at 4 (cid:3) C . However , some coupled proteins are not very stable , so immediate usage is normally advisable . 3 . 4 . 6 . Pull - down from cell lysate Save a sample of cell lysate ( sample ‘‘ Input ’’ ) . Add the cell lysate to the Protein - Sepharose . Again , beads should stay wet and be able to freely move within the dispersion ( use a matrix : liquid phase ra - tio of (cid:2) 1 : 1 , if beads seem too dry add a bit of lysis buffer ) . Incubate the pull - down on a spinning wheel at 4 (cid:3) C ( incubation time from 30 min to overnight , depending on the bait to prey afﬁnity and sta - bility ) . Centrifuge and save a sample of the supernatant ( sample ‘‘ Out ’’ ) . 3 . 4 . 7 . Stringency wash Pool the respective samples ( two pull - downs from the ‘‘straight’’ experiment and the two pull - downs from the crossover ) . Wash one to three times with 4 vol washing buffer ( e . g . 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 0 . 2 % NP - 40 ) . If pull - downs result in a high number of non - speciﬁc background binders ( ribosomal pro - teins , histones ) increase the stringency by using a higher salt or detergent concentration ( 0 . 5 M NaCl , 0 . 1 % SDS ) . 3 . 4 . 8 . Pre - elution wash Wash once with at least 4 volumes of a low buffer non - detergent solution . This step facilitates acidic elution of the bound interaction partners for in - solution digestion . In case in - gel diges - tion is used beads can be directly boiled in SDS – PAGE sample buffer after the stringency wash . 3 . 4 . 9 . Elution Incubate the beads with 100 l l elution buffer , then incubate for 2 min on a spinning wheel or thermo shaker , check the pH ( use a pH indicator stick , the pH should be acidic , if not add more elution buffer , incubate again ) . Centrifuge and save the supernatant , it should contain the protein of interest and interaction partners . Elute three times in total . Pool the three eluates and continue immediately with protein precipitation . 3 . 4 . 10 . Protein precipitation Transfer the sample ( volume not more than 300 l l ) to a 2 ml dust - free tube . Add 70 l l sodium acetate and 2 l l Glycoblue . The addition of Glycoblue is recommended if the protein concentration is low . Fill up to 2 ml with 100 % ethanol and mix brieﬂy by invert - ing the Eppendorf tube . Incubate the precipitation overnight at room temperature or at 4 (cid:3) C and centrifuge the next day with 20 , 000 g at 4 (cid:3) C for at least 30 min . Remove the supernatant care - fully and air dry the protein pellet . Continue with MS sample prep - aration ( Section 3 . 6 ) . 3 . 4 . 11 . Control pull - down efﬁciency To check if the pull - down was efﬁcient , compare the ‘‘input’’ , ‘‘output’’ and bead sample by SDS – PAGE and western blotting . Known interaction partners of the bait protein should be detected in the input sample but signiﬁcantly depleted in the output . A high amount of interaction partners in the bead sample suggests inefﬁ - cient elution . 3 . 5 . Transient transfection of bait protein followed by immunoprecipitation Here , we provide a protocol optimized for immunoprecipita - tions of epitope - tagged proteins overexpressed in the HEK293T system by using the l MACS Epitope Isolation Kit ( Miltenyi Biotec ) . These magnetic microbeads gave best results for our immunopre - cipitations and offer other important advantages [ 13 ] . However , other afﬁnity matrices may work as well . We use linear PEI as the transfection reagent for HEK293T , as it is a highly efﬁcient ( usually P 95 % ) and much cheaper than many other commercially available alternatives . Different cell lines may require different transfection reagents . 3 . 5 . 1 . Transient transfection Mix the expression plasmid with polyethylenimine in a 1 : 2 DNA to PEI ratio ( transfection ratio may need optimization depending on the cell line ) . For a 15 cm cell culture dish mix 15 l g plasmid DNA with 30 l g PEI and add 2 ml of serum - free DMEM . Incubate for 30 – 45 min at room temperature to assure efﬁ - cient binding of the DNA to PEI . Add additional 2 ml of serum - free DMEM and mix brieﬂy before transferring your transfection setup to the cells . Cell conﬂuency should be 60 – 70 % on the day of trans - fection . For control transfections use an empty vector carrying only the tag sequence or a more appropriate control ( see Section 2 . 3 ) . 3 . 5 . 2 . Cell harvesting Harvest the cells 24 h post - transfection . Aspire the medium , wash once with ice - cold DPBS , then add 500 l l of ice - cold RIPA ly - sis buffer . Use cell scrapers to harvest the cells and incubate them for 30 min on ice . Cell debris should be cleared by centrifugation at 20 , 000 g for 10 min at 4 (cid:3) C . 3 . 5 . 3 . Immunoprecipitation from cell lysate Add 50 l l of l MACS beads ( directed against the tag of choice ) to each lysate from different SILAC conditions separately and incu - bate on ice for 45 min . 3 . 5 . 4 . Column preparation Equilibrate the MACS column with 200 l l ice - cold RIPA buffer . Transfer the IP slurries to the MACS column , the different IP setups are now combined on the column . 3 . 5 . 5 . Wash Wash the l MACS column three times with 200 l l lysis buffer and once with 100 l l Miltenyi wash buffer 2 ( included in the Epi - F . E . Paul et al . / Methods 54 ( 2011 ) 387 – 395 393 tope Isolation kit ) , to reduce the salt concentration before elution of the proteins . 3 . 5 . 6 . Elution The proteins are eluted from the l MACS column in a dust - free 2 ml tube by adding 300 l l elution buffer to the column . Continue with protein precipitation as described in Section 3 . 4 . 10 . Precipi - tated proteins are ready for MS sample preparation ( Section 3 . 6 ) . 3 . 6 . In - solution digest MS sample preparation including reduction and alkylation of cysteine residues is done as described [ 35 ] . Lysyl endopeptidase ( Lys - C ) ( Wako ) and sequencing grade modiﬁed trypsin ( Promega ) are used for in - solution digestion . Stop and go extraction tips con - taining C 18 Empore disks ( 3 M ) are used to purify and store peptide extracts [ 36 ] . 3 . 7 . LC - MS / MS On - line LC - MS / MS analysis is performed as described previ - ously [ 28 ] . In brief , peptide mixtures are separated by reversed phase chromatography using the Eksigent NanoLC - 1D Plus system ( Eksigent ) on in - house manufactured 10 - cm fritless silica micro - columns with an inner diameter of 75 l m . Columns are packed with ReproSil - Pur C 18 - AQ 3 l m resin ( Dr . Maisch GmbH ) [ 37 ] . Sep - aration is performed using a 10 – 60 % ACN gradient ( 240 min ) with 0 . 5 % formic acid at a ﬂow rate of 200 nl / min . Eluting peptides are directly ionized by electrospray ionization and transferred into the oriﬁce of a linear trap quadrupole Orbitrap hybrid mass spec - trometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . Mass spectrometry is per - formed in the data - dependent mode with one full scan in the Orbitrap ( m / z 300 – 1700 ; resolution of 60 , 000 ; AGC target value of 1 (cid:3) 10 6 ) . The ﬁve most intense ions with a charge state greater than 1 are selected ( target value 3000 ; monoisotopic precursor selection enabled ) and fragmented in the linear trap quadrupole using CID ( 35 % normalized collision energy and wideband activa - tion enabled ) . Dynamic exclusion for selected precursor ions is 60 s . 3 . 8 . Processing of MS data The MaxQuant software package ( version 1 . 0 . 13 . 13 ) is used to identify and quantify proteins [ 38 , 39 ] . SILAC duplets are extracted from isotope patterns , recalibrated , and quantiﬁed by the Quant module ( heavy label Arg10 and Lys8 , maximum of three labeled amino acids per peptide , polymer detection enabled , and top six MS / MS peaks per 100 Da ) . Peak lists are searched on a Mascot search engine ( version 2 . 2 , Matrix Science ) against an in - house cu - rated database of H . sapiens ( IPI . Human , version 3 . 64 ) plus com - mon contaminants . When performing interaction studies with recombinant proteins expressed in a different organism ( e . g . E . coli ) the database should also contain all protein entries from this organism . This is important since the puriﬁed recombinant protein often still contains trace amount of contaminants derived from this species , and these may be falsely assigned to for example human proteins ( when searching a human database ) . All protein sequences are also reversed to generate a target - decoy database [ 40 ] . Carbamidomethylation of cysteine is selected as a ﬁxed mod - iﬁcation , and oxidation of methionine and acetylation of the pro - tein N - terminus are used as variable modiﬁcations . Lys - C and trypsin are selected as proteases ( full speciﬁcity ) with a maximum of two missed cleavages . A mass tolerance of 0 . 5 Da is selected for fragment ions . A minimum of six amino acids per identiﬁed pep - tide and at least one peptide per protein group are required . The false discovery rate is set to 1 % at both the peptide and protein levels . Protein ratios are calculated from the median of all normal - ized peptide ratios using only unique peptides or peptides assigned to the protein group with the highest number of peptides . Only protein groups with at least three SILAC counts are considered for further analysis . 4 . Conclusions Combining classical pull - down or coIP techniques with SILAC - based quantitative proteomics is a powerful approach to detect PPIs with high sensitivity and , perhaps more importantly , high speciﬁcity . As an example for exogenous bait expression , we show that recombinantly expressed GTP c S - loaded Cdc42 versus the GDP - loaded form can be used to identify speciﬁc interaction part - ners of both forms of this Rho - GTPase ( Fig . 3A – C ) . As an example for cellular expression of tagged bait we used Ataxin - 1 and show speciﬁc interaction with 14 - 3 - 3 protein epsilon ( Fig . 3D – F ) . In all cases , heavy - to - light SILAC ratios of speciﬁc interaction partners are inverted in the crossover experiment , validating their speciﬁc binding . In contrast , non - speciﬁc background binders show a 1 : 1 ratio in both the straight and the crossover experiment ( Fig . 3C ) . A contaminating serum protein is always detected in the light ( i . e . unlabeled ) form and can thus easily be excluded ( Fig . 3F ) . We also show that covalently crosslinking the bait to the matrix yields a higher number of literature - reported interaction partners ( Fig . 2 ) . We assume that crosslinking reduces the amount of bait - derived peptides in the sample which facilitates MS analysis . The highest number of known interaction partners was detected using the NHS - approach , where 10 interaction partners were exclusively found . Only two interaction partners were not covered by the NHS - based pull - down . In summary , the two protocols described and the background information provided should facilitate adapting the generic q - AP - MS strategy for a wide range of biological questions .
