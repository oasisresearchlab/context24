We show here that these RGS domains interact with Rab11 and GTP - bound Rab4 , the first demonstration of RGS domains binding small GTPases . Rab4 and Rab11 help regulate membrane trafficking through the endocytic recycling pathways by recruiting effector proteins tospecificmembranedomains . AlthoughD - AKAP2isprimarily cytosolic in HeLa cells , a fraction of the protein localizes to endosomes and can be recruited there to a greater extent by overexpression of Rab4 or Rab11 . D - AKAP2 also regulates the morphology of the Rab11 - containing compartment , with co - ex - pression causing accumulation of both proteins on enlarged endosomes . Knockdown of D - AKAP2 by RNA interference caused a redistribution of both Rab11 and the constitutively recycling transferrin receptor to the periphery of cells . Knockdown also caused an increase in the rate of transferrin recycling , suggesting that D - AKAP2 promotes accumulation of recycling proteins in the Rab4 / Rab11 - positive endocytic recycling compartment . Dual - specific A - kinase - anchoring protein 2 ( D - AKAP2 / AKAP10 ) , 5 which was first discovered as a binding partner for both the RI and RII regulatory subunits of protein kinase A ( PKA ) , is a ubiquitous scaffold protein containing two tandem RGS ( regulator of G - protein signaling ) domains and a carboxyl - terminal PDZ ( PSD95 / Dlg / ZO1 ) - binding motif ( 1 , 2 ) . The PDZ - binding motif was subsequently shown to interact with the multi - PDZ domain proteins PDZK1 and NHERF - 1 , allow - ing D - AKAP2 to link indirectly to membrane proteins such as the sodium - dependent phosphate co - transporter ( NaP i - IIa ) , which is regulated by trafficking into and out of the plasma membrane ( 3 ) . D - AKAP2 is considered the sole member of its own subfamily of mammalian RGS proteins and is the only one to contain two RGS domains , referred to as RGS - A and RGS - B ( 4 , 5 ) . RGS proteins contain conserved (cid:1) - helical domains of around 120 residues , which usually interact with heterotrimeric G protein (cid:1) - subunits , in many cases acting as GTPase - activat - ing proteins ( 6 , 7 ) . Although deuterium exchange - mass spec - trometry experiments suggest that RGS - B folds into the tradi - tional (cid:1) - helical structure , RGS - A is predicted to have a (cid:1) 122 residue insertion ( residues 170 – 291 ) , but it is unknown how RGS - A , which is predicted to have a (cid:1) 122 - residue insertion ( residues 170 – 291 ) , folds or interacts with RGS - B ( 8 ) . D - AKAP2 has so far demonstrated no specific interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins , and no ability to activate them , rais - ing the possibility of nontraditional targets . 6 In this study , we show that the RGS domains of D - AKAP2 interact not with heterotrimeric G proteins but with the small GTPases Rab4 and Rab11 , which regulate endocytic recycling . Endocytic membrane traffic determines the cellular destination of internalized receptors and other membrane pro - teins , receptor ligands , lipid , and solute molecules . The Rab subfamily of Ras - like GTPases is known to play a key role in regulating such processes as vesicle formation , motility , and docking ( 9 , 10 ) . Rab proteins help to establish the identity of membrane compartments and organize distinct membrane domains , typically by interacting in their GTP - bound active state with downstream effectors , which may be recruited to membranes through combinatorial interactions in a highly spe - cific manner ( 11 ) . The transferrin receptor ( TfnR ) is a commonly studied marker of constitutive recycling . TfnR endocytosed in Rab5 - positive vesicles is delivered initially to Rab5 / Rab4 - positive peripheral tubular - vesicular structures called sorting endo - somes or early endosomes ( 12 , 13 ) . Bound transferrin , after releasing its iron in the sorting endosomes , is segregated with its receptor and the vast majority of lipid molecules and mem - * Thisworkwassupported , inwholeorinpart , byNationalInstitutesofHealth Grant DK054441 .

The receptor then recycles to the plasma membrane either directly in the “fast” recycling pathway , which is thought to be regulated by Rab4 ( 14 , 15 ) , or indirectly via the Rab4 / Rab11 - positive endocytic recycling compartment ( ERC ) in the “slow” recycling pathway . The ERC is a collection of tubular structures associated with microtubules , which in many cell types is condensed around the microtubule - organizing center but in others is more dis - persed throughout the cytoplasm . Rab11 localizes mainly to the ERC and regulates trafficking through this organelle ( 16 , 17 ) . Here , we show that through interactions with Rab4 and Rab11 , D - AKAP2 can alter the morphology of the Rab11 compartment and affect the recycling of the transferrin receptor .

Human holotransferrin , deferroxamine , GDP , and GTP (cid:2) S were from Sigma . AlexaFluor 488 - labeled transferrin was from Invitrogen . DNA Constructs —Enhanced GFP fusions to canine Rab4b WT , Rab4b Q67L , Rab4b S22N , Rab11a WT , Rab11a S25N , Rab5a WT , Rab5a Q79L , Rab5a S34N , and Rab7a WT were obtained from Dr . Robert Lodge ( Centre Hospitalier Universi - taire de Que´bec , Quebec , Canada ) . Additional mutations were generated using QuikChange ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . All D - AKAP2 constructs used the human gene with valine at posi - tion 646 . Mouse PDZK1 DNA was obtained from Dr . Heini Murer ( University of Zurich , Switzerland ) . mCherry DNA was obtained from Dr . Roger Tsien ( University of California at San Diego ) . Generation of truncations and subcloning were per - formed by standard methods . Vectors for expression of mCherry - and FLAG - tagged proteins were generated by insert - ing the tag as a BamHI / EcoRI fragment into pcDNA3 with the coding sequence for the protein of interest following as an EcoRI / XhoI fragment . Cell Culture , Fractionation , and Immunofluorescence Mi - croscopy —HeLa and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbec - co’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) plus 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 (cid:3) GlutaMAX - I ( Invitrogen ) . HeLa cells were frac - tionated using the Qproteome cell compartment kit ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . For microscopy , HeLa cells were grown in 35 - mm glass - bottom microwell dishes ( MatTek ) . Cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 ( Roche Applied Science ) and analyzed roughly 20 h later . Cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) at room temperature for 20 min . For immunostaining , cells were permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( Fisher ) in PBS for 5 min and blocked with 2 % normal donkey serum and 0 . 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in PBS . Wash buffer con - sisted of PBS plus 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , and antibodies were diluted into a 1 : 5 dilution of block buffer into wash buffer . Images were captured on either a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope ( Photo - metrics , Tucson , AZ ) or a Radiance 2000 laser - scanning confo - cal microscope ( Bio - Rad ) . For live imaging , cells were washed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution and imaged at room temper - ature on the Zeiss microscope . Images were processed , merged , and pseudocolored using Adobe Photoshop . To quantify colo - calization on endosomes , the background was subtracted from both channels , and the intensity value for the 95th percentile of pixels within the cell was determined . All pixels under this threshold were set to zero , and the Pearson’s coefficient for the two channels was calculated using the ImageJ plug - in , JACoP ( 19 ) . Co - immunoprecipitation —HEK293 cells in 6 - cm dishes were transfected with FuGENE 6 and harvested (cid:1) 20 h later . Pelleted cells were lysed on ice for 10 min in 400 (cid:3) l of 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 100 m M NaCl , 5 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M dithiothre - itol , protease inhibitor mixture set III ( Calbiochem ) , and 1 % Nonidet P - 40 . After centrifugation for 20 min at 21 , 000 (cid:3) g , 330 (cid:3) l of lysate was added to 20 (cid:3) l of EZview Red anti - FLAG M2 affinity gel ( Sigma ) suspended in 670 (cid:3) l of wash buffer , which was equivalent to the lysis buffer but contained only 0 . 05 % Nonidet P - 40 . Afte r 1 h ofincubation at 4 °C with rotation , the affinity resin was spun and washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer . Protein was eluted with ImmunoPure IgG elution buffer ( Pierce ) , heated with SDS sample buffer , and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . GST - Rab4 Pulldown —Free GST and GST - tagged Rab4 were expressed from the pGEX4T - 1 vector in BL21 Escherichia coli cells and purified by standard means using glutathione - Sepha - rose 4B ( GE Healthcare ) . GST - Rab4 was loaded with either 1 m M GDP or GTP (cid:2) S in 20 m M Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 150 m M NaCl , and 4 m M EDTA at 30 °C for 1 h after which MgCl 2 was added to 20 m M . HEK293 cells transfected with a pcDNA3 vector express - ing untagged D - AKAP2 were combined with untransfected cells , lysed in 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 150 m M NaCl , 5 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M dithiothreitol , 0 . 05 % Nonidet P - 40 , and protease inhibitors , and incubated with 75 (cid:3) g of each GST protein at 4 °C for 2 h . Proteins were precipitated with glutathione resin , washed , eluted with wash buffer supplemented with 10 mg / ml reduced glutathione ( Sigma ) , and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting .

Approximately five medium - size colonies were selected and resuspended in water . After all sam - ples were diluted to equivalent densities , serial dilutions were spotted on selection plates (cid:4) Trp / (cid:4) Leu , (cid:4) Trp / (cid:4) Leu / (cid:4) His , and (cid:4) Trp / (cid:4) Leu / (cid:4) His / (cid:5) 10 m M 3 - amino - 1 , 2 , 4 triazole . After 3 – 4 days of growth at 30 °C , the presence of protein interac - tions was determined using the most stringent selection . The results given are representative of at least three trials . Transferrin Recycling Assays —Cells were washed and incu - bated with DMEM supplemented with 0 . 5 % BSA ( DMEM / BSA ) for 2 h at 37 °C . Cells were pulsed for 20 min at 37 °C with 50 (cid:3) g / ml AlexaFluor 488 - conjugated transferrin in DMEM / BSA . Cells were washed twice with DMEM / BSA plus the iron chelator deferroxamine ( 50 (cid:3) M ; Sigma ) . Cells were chased for 0 , 15 , or 30 min in DMEM / BSA plus 50 (cid:3) M deferroxamine and 250 (cid:3) g / ml unlabeled transferrin ( Sigma ) . Cells were then washed once with 4 °C PBS , once with 4 °C stripping buffer ( 500 m M NaCl , 0 . 5 % acetic acid , pH 3 . 0 ) , and twice more with PBS . Cells for imaging were fixed immediately . Cells to be quantified by flow cytometry were removed from the plate by incubating them with 0 . 526 m M EDTA ( Irvine Scientific ) for 4 min before chilling and centrifugation . Propidium iodide was added to cells just prior to analysis in order to distinguish broken cells . The amount of total fluorescent transferrin remaining in each cell was quantified on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer ( BD Bio - sciences ) by counting 10 , 000 intact cells from each plate , with three plates per condition . The mean fluorescence intensity (cid:6) S . E . is reported after subtracting the background fluorescence of control cells with no added transferrin and then normalizing to the fluorescence of the control cells at 0 min . To determine the statistical significance of differences between control and knockdown plates , we used an independent two - sample , two - tailed t test with a p value for type 1 error . To convert the data to a rate of recycling , individual means for each plate were fit to a single exponential decay , F (cid:7) F o e (cid:4) kt , where F 0 represents the fluorescence at time zero , and k represents the rate of recycling . The experiment was performed on three separate occasions with similar results . RNA Interference —To knock down levels of D - AKAP2 with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , 35 - mm dishes of HeLa cells were transfected with 3 pmol of siRNA ( Sigma - Proligo ) based on the D - AKAP2 sequence 5 (cid:2) - GAATCTTCCTCTA - CACTTA - 3 (cid:2) together with 3 (cid:3) l of RNAiMax transfection rea - gent ( Invitrogen ) in 3 ml ( final volume ) of medium . The nega - tive control siRNA was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( sc - 37007 ) . Cells were analyzed 2 days after siRNA treatment . Any transfection of plasmid DNA was performed 1 day after siRNA treatment . Scaling up for larger dishes of cells was per - formed with equivalent final concentrations of siRNA and transfection reagent . RESULTS D - AKAP2 Can Localize to the Rab4 / Rab11 Endocytic Recy - cling Compartment —To determine the biological function of D - AKAP2 , we first sought to identify its subcellular localization in HeLa cells . Cell fractionation showed that endogenous D - AKAP2 is almost entirely cytosolic ( Fig . 1 A ) . Transfection of D - AKAP2 tagged with mCherry ( mCh ) also showed diffuse cytosolic localization in most cells . However , imaging of live cells revealed a subpopulation of mCh - D - AKAP2 molecules localized to dynamic and motile puncta that was visible against the cytosolic background . D - AKAP2 in these puncta colocal - ized significantly with internalized fluorescently labeled trans - ferrin , a marker of the endocytic recycling pathway ( supple - mental Movie 1 ) . Some fixed cells also displayed visible accumulation of mCh - D - AKAP2 on what appeared to be intra - FIGURE 1 . D - AKAP2 in HeLa cells is primarily cytosolic but can localize to membranes of the transferrin recycling pathway . A , HeLa cells were frac - tionated into cytosol , membrane , nucleus , and cytoskeleton fractions and probed for endogenous D - AKAP2 and markers . B – D , confocal microscopy of HeLa cells showed some accumulation of overexpressed mCh - D - AKAP2 on membrane structures that colocalized with fluorescently labeled transferrin pulsed for 5 min and chased for 10 min ( B ) and with the endogenous trans - ferrin receptor ( C ) . The early endosome marker EEA1 showed minimal colo - calizationwithmCh - D - AKAP2 , sometimesappearingonadjacentmembrane domains ( D ) . Scale bars , 10 (cid:3) m . D - AKAP2 RGS Domains Bind Rab4 and Rab11 NOVEMBER 20 , 2009• VOLUME 284•NUMBER 47 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 32871 by gu e s t on J u l y 11 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m cellular membranes , and confocal microscopy confirmed that many of these puncta colocalized with internalized transferrin ( Fig . 1 B ) . Staining cells for various membrane markers also revealed colocalization with a subset of the endogenous trans - ferrin receptor ( Fig . 1 C ) , which was more widely distributed than pulse - chased transferrin . D - AKAP2 showed partial colo - calization with the early endosome marker EEA1 but most often appeared to be present on adjacent endosomes or endo - somal domains ( Fig . 1 D ) . D - AKAP2 showed very little colocal - ization with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum , the Golgi complex , lysosomes , peroxisomes , or mitochondria ( supple - mental Fig . S1 ) . D - AKAP2 was suggested previously to localize partially to mitochondria ( 2 ) . The different result in the previ - ous study may have been because of the use of a polyclonal antibody with a greater degree of cross - reactivity or the use of different cell types . Because Rab GTPases play a large role in determining the identity of particular endosomal compartments , we co - ex - pressed mCh - D - AKAP2 with GFP - tagged Rab proteins as well as their GDP - or GTP - locked mutant forms ( Fig . 2 ) . D - AKAP2 not only colocalized with Rab4 and Rab11 , two Rab proteins known to regulate endocytic recycling , but also showed increased endosomal localization upon co - expres - sion with the Rab proteins . This was especially true of Rab11 ; its co - expression with D - AKAP2 caused accumulation of both proteins on enlarged , dynamic endosomes ( Fig . 2 A and supplemental Movie 2 ) . These enlarged endosomes were still accessible to internalized transferrin ( data not shown ) . Nei - ther the GDP - locked form ( dominant negative S25N ( 16 ) ) nor the GTP - locked form ( GTPase - deficient S20V ( 20 ) ) of Rab11 was as effective as WT in recruiting D - AKAP2 onto endosomes , implying that the cycle of GTP hydrolysis was important for their colocalization ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . Rab11 Q70L also has been used by several groups as a putative GTPase - deficient mutant by analogy to other Rab proteins ( 21 ) , but it has been found that S20V , and not Q70L , acts as a dominant active mutation ( 20 , 22 ) . Likewise , we found little difference between Rab11 Q70L and the WT with respect to complex formation with D - AKAP2 ( data not shown ) . Unlike Rab11 , Rab4 showed extensive colocalization with D - AKAP2 in both the WT and the GTP - locked ( Q67L ) , but not the GDP - locked ( S22N ) , forms ( Fig . 2 , D – F ) . Neither Rab5 WT nor the GTP - locked Rab5 Q79L appeared to recruit D - AKAP2 from the cytosol , but like EEA1 , they sometimes appeared to reside on an adjacent domain of the same endo - some ( Fig . 2 , G and H ) , and in live imaging they could be found on some of the same motile puncta ( data not shown ) . GDP - locked Rab5 S34N , as well as the late endosomal Rab7 , showed very little colocalization with D - AKAP2 on endo - somes ( Fig . 2 , I and J ) . When mCh - D - AKAP2 was expressed with both GFP - Rab11 and FLAG - Rab4 , it generally localized to endosomes positive for both Rab proteins ( Fig . 3 A ) . Colocalization of mCh - D - AKAP2 and GFP - Rab11 with the GTP - locked FLAG - Rab4 Q67L was even more pronounced ( Fig . 3 B ) . Endogenous D - AKAP2 also clearly colocalized with GFP - Rab4 and mCh - Rab11 on endosomes , with an apparent preference for endo - somes positive for both Rab proteins ( Fig . 3 , C – E ) . Addition - ally , D - AKAP2 on endosomes was able to recruit PDZ proteins through its carboxyl - terminal PDZ - binding motif . FLAG - tagged PDZK1 , which contains four PDZ domains , localized to GFP - Rab11 endosomes in the presence of mCherry - tagged D - AKAP2 but not D - AKAP2 (cid:8) PDZ , which lacks the three residues at the carboxyl terminus required for the PDZ interaction ( Fig . 3 , F and G ) . Because other PDZ domains of PDZK1 are known to bind to membrane proteins containing PDZ - binding motifs , D - AKAP2 may serve to link recycling cargo to Rab proteins in a PDZ - dependent fashion . D - AKAP2 Interacts with Rab4 and Rab11 through Its RGS Domains —To determine whether D - AKAP2 forms protein complexes with Rab4 and Rab11 , we co - transfected HEK293 cells with FLAG - tagged D - AKAP2 and GFP - tagged Rab pro - teins and immunoprecipitated them with anti - FLAG anti - bodies ( Fig . 4 A ) . D - AKAP2 specifically co - immunoprecipi - tated GFP - tagged Rab4 and Rab11 but not Rab5 . Consistent with the colocalization results , D - AKAP2 preferentially pulled down GTP - locked Rab4 ( Q67L (cid:9) WT (cid:9) S22N ) and wild - type Rab11 ( WT (cid:9) S20V (cid:7) S25N ) . The observation that neither the GDP - nor the GTP - locked mutant form of Rab11 was precipitated by D - AKAP2 could imply that the interaction was stabilized by additional protein contacts that may be absent with the mutants because of altered localiza - tion . A FLAG - tagged truncation of D - AKAP2 containing the RGS domains ( residues 1 – 513 ) was also able to immunopre - cipitate Rab4 Q67L and Rab11 WT . Furthermore , purified GST - tagged Rab4 bound to the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analog GTP (cid:2) S was much more able to pull down D - AKAP2 from a HEK293 lysate than GDP - bound GST - Rab4 or GST alone ( Fig . 4 B ) . Unfortunately , GST - Rab11 did not form a stable enough complex with D - AKAP2 to be observed in pulldown experiments ( data not shown ) . To look more closely at the determinants of D - AKAP2 protein complexes with Rab4 and Rab11 on endosomes , we co - expressed mCherry - tagged truncations of D - AKAP2 with Rab4 or Rab11 ( Fig . 5 , A – K , and supplemental Fig . S2 for the complete panel of truncations ) . Truncations or muta - tions of D - AKAP2 that disrupted PKA binding were no lon - ger excluded from the nucleus ( Fig . 5 , D – F and I – K , and data not shown ) . This had the effect of lowering the level of cyto - solic protein for carboxyl - terminal truncations , which may have led to decreased endosomal localization . Because co - expression with Rab11 often caused substantial recruitment of D - AKAP2 to enlarged Rab11 - containing endosomes , it was readily apparent which regions of D - AKAP2 were responsible for this phenotype . The tandem RGS domains ( residues 120 – 513 ) were necessary and sufficient for this colocalization ( Fig . 5 F ) . Truncations missing all or part of one RGS domain ( residues 292 – 662 , 1 – 369 , 514 – 662 , and 374 – 662 ) were not recruited to Rab11 endosomes ( Fig . 5 , C and E , and supplemental Fig . S2 , D and H ) , whereas all con - structs containing both RGS domains ( residues 120 – 662 , 1 – 513 , 120 – 513 , 1 – 662 , 1 – 659 ) were recruited ( Fig . 5 , B , D , and F , and supplemental Fig . S2 , A and I ) . Co - expression of D - AKAP2 with Rab4 did not cause the same level of accu - mulation on endosomes , so the colocalization was less pro - nounced . Furthermore , the determinants of localization to D - AKAP2 RGS Domains Bind Rab4 and Rab11 32872 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 284•NUMBER 47• NOVEMBER 20 , 2009 by gu e s t on J u l y 11 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Rab4 endosomes appeared to be distributed more widely throughout the protein .

D - AKAP2 RGS Domains Bind Rab4 and Rab11 32874 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 284•NUMBER 47• NOVEMBER 20 , 2009 by gu e s t on J u l y 11 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m first 291 residues ( Fig . 5 H ) . These results suggest that local - ization of D - AKAP2 to endosomes may result from multiple protein interactions . To confirm these protein interactions and further investi - gate the binding determinants , we employed a split - ubiq - uitin yeast two - hybrid approach ( Fig . 5 L ) . The tandem RGS domains ( residues 120 – 513 ) were sufficient to bind to both Rab4 and Rab11 . In this assay , the RGS domains appeared to interact preferentially with GTP - bound Rab4 and GDP - bound Rab11 , because they interacted with Rab4 Q67L and Rab11 S25N but not with Rab4 S22N or Rab11 S20V . It could be that we did not observe stable protein complexes between D - AKAP2 and Rab11 S25N in the co - immunoprecipitation experiments because of the inability of that Rab mutant to localize properly to the endosomes . Neither RGS - A ( resi - dues 120 – 369 ) nor RGS - B ( residues 374 – 513 ) alone was able to interact with Rab4 or Rab11 , suggesting that the two RGS domains form a single functional unit . D - AKAP2 Regulates Trafficking through the Endocytic Recy - cling Compartment —Because co - expression with D - AKAP2 causes Rab11 to accumulate on enlarged endosomes , we asked what effect knocking down D - AKAP2 expression by RNA interference would have on the recycling compart - ment . Treating HeLa cells for 2 days with siRNA directed against D - AKAP2 effectively knocked down nearly all of the endogenous protein ( Fig . 6 A ) . Cells treated with siRNA were transfected with GFP - Rab4 and / or mCh - Rab11 and stained for endogenous EEA1 , a marker of early endosomes ( Fig . 6 , B – G ) . Compared with the control siRNA , cells knocked down for D - AKAP2 showed an increased localization of mCh - Rab11 at the periphery , often at regions of membrane protrusion ( Fig . 6 , B – E ) . In some cells , Rab11 also appeared more condensed or more tubular than in control cells . GFP - Rab4 also became more peripheral in the D - AKAP2 knock - down cells but not to the same extent as Rab11 ( Fig . 6 , B , C , F , and G ) . Endogenous Rab11 and TfnR showed a movement to the periphery of the cell similar to that of mCh - Rab11 ( Fig . 6 , H and I ) . EEA1 staining of early endosomes appeared unchanged , for the most part , in all cells ( Fig . 6 , B – G ) . D - AKAP2 knockdown cells were also stained for other mem - brane markers . Although there was no obvious effect on the endoplasmic reticulum , peroxi - somes , or lysosomes ( data not shown ) , knocking down D - AKAP2 did appear to cause fragmentation of the Golgi complex , as seen by the staining of the cis - / medial - Golgi marker giantin and of (cid:2) - adaptin , a subunit of the AP - 1 clathrin adaptor complex involved in vesicle formation both at the trans - Golgi network and on endo - somes ( Fig . 6 , J and K ) . Rab11 is thought to play a role in traffic from endosomes to the Golgi ( 23 ) . We next tested whether the changes in the morphology of the recycling compartment were linked to altered kinetics of receptor recycling by performing a pulse - chase experiment with fluorescently labeled trans - ferrin . HeLa cells were pulsed for 20 min with fluorescent transferrin and then chased in the presence of unlabeled trans - ferrin and the iron chelator deferroxamine for 0 , 15 , or 30 min . In control cells , the pulse - chased transferrin tended to accumu - late in the perinuclear region , whereas in D - AKAP2 knock - down cells , it showed a greater accumulation near the plasma membrane ( Fig . 7 , A – F ) . To quantify the rate of transferrin recycling , using flow cytometry we measured the total amount of fluorescent transferrin remaining in each cell after different chase times ( Fig . 7 G ) . After the 20 - min pulse ( 0 min chase ) , cells treated with D - AKAP2 siRNA contained 33 . 3 (cid:6) 6 . 2 % more transferrin than cells treated with control siRNA ( control (cid:7) 100 , D - AKAP2 siRNA (cid:7) 133 . 3 ; p (cid:7) 0 . 0022 , two - tailed t test ) , whereas after a 30 - min chase they contained 31 . 0 (cid:6) 8 . 5 % less transferrin ( control (cid:7) 30 . 9 , D - AKAP2 siRNA (cid:7) 21 . 3 ; p (cid:7) 0 . 023 ) . Fitting all of the data to an exponential decay function yielded a rate of transferrin recycling that was 73 (cid:6) 21 % faster in the D - AKAP2 knockdown cells than in control cells ( 2 . 11 (cid:6) 0 . 24 / h for control cells and 3 . 64 (cid:6) 0 . 12 / h for D - AKAP2 knock - down cells ) . The increased internalization of transferrin during the pulse was not due to a change in the rate of endocytosis but rather to increased surface expression of the receptor , presum - ably caused by the faster recycling ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that endogenous D - AKAP2 may promote the accumulation of transferrin in the slow recycling pathway of the Rab4 / Rab11 - containing ERC . In the D - AKAP2 knockdown cells , the increased rate of traffic to the plasma membrane may exceed the rate of exocytosis , resulting in increased localization of internalized transferrin near the cell surface ( Fig . 7 , E and F ) . One mechanism for how knockdown of D - AKAP2 might increase the rate of recycling would be by decreasing the amount of cargo entering the slower , Rab11 - dependent , recycling pathway through the ERC and shunting more into the faster direct pathway . Another mechanism would be by increasing the rate of trafficking from the ERC to the plasma membrane . The former model would predict a decrease in the amount of colocalization of internalized transferrin with Rab11 . The fact that the knockdown of D - AKAP2 had similar effects on the membrane compartments of endogenous Rab11 FIGURE 4 . D - AKAP2 forms protein complexes with Rab4 and Rab11 .

DISCUSSION Although the mechanisms that regulate recycling of endocy - tosed proteins back to the plasma membrane are poorly under - stood , the small GTPases Rab4 and Rab11 are known to play key roles . Here we report that D - AKAP2 can bind to both Rab4 and Rab11 through its two RGS domains , recruiting D - AKAP2 from the cytosol onto endosomes of the recycling pathway . This represents a novel interaction for RGS domains , which typically interact with heterotrimeric G proteins rather than with Ras - like G proteins . D - AKAP2 appears to act as a traditional effector for Rab4 , binding most stably to GTP (cid:2) S - bound Rab4 or to its GTP - locked mutant form . Rab11 , on the other hand , interacts in a more nontraditional manner . Three observations support the presence of this protein complex : 1 ) Rab11 co - immunopre - cipitated with D - AKAP2 from human cells , 2 ) the RGS domains interacted with Rab11 in a yeast two - hybrid assay , and 3 ) overexpression of Rab11 recruited D - AKAP2 to Rab11 - positive endosomes . In the yeast two - hybrid assay , D - AKAP2 inter - acted with both dominant negative and wild - type Rab11 , but only wild - type Rab11 , and not the GDP - and GTP - locked forms , formed stable complexes in mammalian cells . Rab effectors are often recruited to membranes by the coordinated interactions of multiple proteins ( 11 ) . Therefore , the preference of D - AKAP2 for wild - type Rab11 in mammalian cells could be because the mutant forms do not localize to the proper membrane microdo - mains to make additional stabiliz - ing interactions . The lack of bind - ing to the GTP - locked form could also indicate that D - AKAP2 may have guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity toward Rab11 . If this were the case , D - AKAP2 could serve to activate and recruit Rab11 to membranes containing active Rab4 or to maintain Rab11 in an active state while in the Rab4 / Rab11 - containing ERC . Because the interactions of a number of effectors with Rab pro - teins are mediated by coiled coils or helical hairpins ( 24 – 26 ) , the helical RGS domains could present a si - milar binding interface . The RGS domains of D - AKAP2 may consti - tute a single functional unit , as neither domain alone showed Rab binding by yeast two - hybrid anal - ysis ( Fig . 5 L ) or showed strong recruitment to endosomes in HeLa cells ( Fig . 5 , E and J , and supplemental Fig . S2 , H and R ) . It is possible that simultaneous interactions with both Rab proteins may be important for the localization of D - AKAP2 to endosomes . No protein is currently known to bind simultaneously to both Rab4 and Rab11 . The Rab - coupling protein was found to interact with both Rab4 and Rab11 ( 27 ) , but subsequent results indicated that in vitro they share the same binding site and that in vivo Rab11 is probably the dominant interacting partner ( 28 , 29 ) . While this manuscript was in preparation , it was reported that a large - scale yeast two - hybrid screen for targets of Rab proteins had identified D - AKAP2 as an interacting partner for Rab proteins 4A / B , 14 , 19 , 40A / B / C , and 41 ( 30 ) . The fragments of D - AKAP2 pulled from the mouse cDNA library appear to be similar to the 292 – 662 truncation , which showed faint localization to GFP - Rab4 endosomes but did not accumulate with Rab11 on enlarged endosomes ( Fig . 5 , C and H ) . Taken together , these results suggest that the second half of RGS - A may combine with RGS - B ( residues 292 – 513 ) to form the Rab4 - binding domain , whereas the first half of FIGURE7 .

D - AKAP2 RGS Domains Bind Rab4 and Rab11 32878 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 284•NUMBER 47• NOVEMBER 20 , 2009 by gu e s t on J u l y 11 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m RGS - A ( residues 120 – 291 ) may be necessary but not suffi - cient for Rab11 binding . RGS - A is atypical among RGS pro - teins for its large insertion predicted to be between helices (cid:1) 4 and (cid:1) 5 ( 8 ) . D - AKAP2 appears to regulate the morphology of the Rab11 - containing compartment , with co - expression causing enlarged Rab11 endosomes ( Fig . 2 A ) and knockdown causing movement of Rab11 to the periphery ( Fig . 6 , C , E , and I ) and an accompa - nying increase in the rate of transferrin recycling ( Fig . 7 G ) . D - AKAP2 may act in a fashion analogous to Rabaptin - 5 , a diva - lent Rab effector that is also primarily cytosolic but can be recruited onto specific endosomal domains by simultaneous interactions with Rab4 and Rab5 ( 31 ) . Rabaptin - 5 inhibits the formation of recycling vesicles in vitro , whereas its depletion accelerates their formation ( 32 ) . Overexpression of Rabaptin - 5 leads to enlarged endosomes and delayed recycling of trans - ferrin ( 31 , 33 ) . Although Rabaptin - 5 would be expected to reg - ulate recycling from Rab5 / Rab4 - positive sorting endosomes , D - AKAP2 may similarly inhibit recycling from Rab4 / Rab11 domains . Given its carboxyl - terminal interactions , it seems likely that D - AKAP2 helps mediate PKA - or PDZ - dependent regulation of trafficking . D - AKAP2 has been shown to interact with the PDZ - containing proteins NHERF - 1 and PDZK1 / NHERF - 3 through a carboxyl - terminal type I PDZ ligand , TKL ( 3 ) . Such PDZ ligands can act as transplantable “recycling sequences” that are sufficient to cause endocytosed receptors such as the (cid:4) 2 - adrenergic receptor to recycle rapidly to the plasma mem - brane ( 34 , 35 ) . We found that D - AKAP2 could recruit PDZK1 to endosomes but not if its PDZ ligand was removed ( Fig . 3 , F and G ) . At endogenous protein levels , the PDZ domain proteins may help recruit D - AKAP2 to membrane domains rich in pro - teins containing PDZ - binding motifs . PKA tethered to D - AKAP2 may have several effects . Binding either type I or type II PKA could affect the binding of other proteins to D - AKAP2 and vice versa . PKA could modulate D - AKAP2 function by phosphorylating its conserved consen - sus phosphorylation site ( residue 554 ) . Proteins binding to D - AKAP2 could also be targets , because phosphorylation of PDZK1 by PKA has been shown to cause increased protein expression of a PDZK1 binding partner , scavenger receptor class B type I ( 36 ) . Finally , PKA anchored by D - AKAP2 could phosphorylate recycling membrane proteins directly . Phospho - rylation of aquaporin - 2 by PKA , for instance , is required for its vasopressin - induced translocation from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane ( 37 ) . Although the biological function of D - AKAP2 has remained unknown for many years , it has been linked genetically to dis - ease in humans . A single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) caus - ing an I646V transition in the PKA - binding motif of D - AKAP2 shows the strongest correlation with morbidity or mortality of 6 , 500 SNPs studied ( 38 ) . The I646V SNP , which increases the affinity for the RI regulatory subunit of PKA ( 38 ) , is associated with myocardial infarction ( 39 , 40 ) , heart rate dysregulation ( 41 ) , and familial breast cancer ( 42 ) . In mice , a gene disruption deleting the last 51 residues of D - AKAP2 acts in a dominant negative fashion to increase cardiac arrhythmia , cholinergic sensitivity , and premature adult deaths ( 41 ) . Our results show that the interactions of D - AKAP2 with Rab4 and Rab11 allow it to regulate protein recycling and suggest that these disease phe - notypes could be the result of altered surface expression of var - ious receptors or channels . D - AKAP2 may help fill several gaps in our understanding of membrane trafficking , including how Rab11 links to Rab4 , how PDZ ligands link to the recycling machinery , and how PKA regulates trafficking .
