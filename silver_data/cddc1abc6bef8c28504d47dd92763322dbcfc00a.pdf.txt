ARTICLE Julie Plastino Æ Ioannis Lelidis Æ Jacques Prost Ce´cile Sykes The effect of diffusion , depolymerization and nucleation promoting factors on actin gel growth Received : 30 September 2003 / Accepted : 14 October 2003 / Published online : 9 December 2003 (cid:1) EBSA 2003 Abstract In eukaryotic cells , localized actin polymeriza - tion is able to deform the plasma membrane and push the cell forward . Depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments and diﬀusion of actin monomers ensure the availability of monomers at sites of polymerization , and therefore these processes must play an active role in cellular actin dynamics . Here we reveal experimental evidence that actin gel growth can be limited by monomer diﬀusion , consistent with theoretical predictions . We study actin gels formed on beads coated with ActA ( and ActA fragments ) , the bacterial factor responsible for actin - based movement of Listeria monocytogenes . We observe a saturation of gel thickness with increasing bead radius , the signature of diﬀusion control . Data analysis using an elastic model of actin gel growth gives an estimate of 2 · 10 ) 8 cm ) 2 s ) 1 for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of actin monomers through the gel , ten times less than in buﬀer , and in agreement with literature values in bulk cyto - skeleton , providing corroboration of our model . The depolymerization rate of actin ﬁlaments and the elastic modulus of the gel are also evaluated . Furthermore , we qualitatively examine the diﬀerent actin gels produced when ActA fragments interact with either VASP or the Arp2 / 3 complex . Keywords Actin polymerization Æ Arp2 / 3 complex Æ Lamellipodium Æ Motility Æ Vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein Introduction The polymerization of actin monomers into ﬁlaments against a surface drives the extension of cellular lamellipodia , as well as the intracellular movement of certain vesicles and endosomes , and various pathogens . Much progress has been made in the last ﬁve years to - ward understanding the biochemical mechanisms of cellular actin polymerization . Particular emphasis has been placed on the Arp2 / 3 complex , a component of actin Y - branches ( Mullins et al . 1998 ; Svitkina and Borisy 1999 ) that is recruited to the leading edge under the control of cellular signaling systems ( for review , see Machesky and Insall 1999 ) . The VASP ( vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ) family proteins also localize to the leading edge of cells , as well as to focal adhesions and stress ﬁbers ; however , their role in cell motility is still somewhat controversial ( for reviews , see Machesky 2002 ; Sutherland and Way 2002 ) . Despite the high concentrations of monomeric actin in cells , ﬁlaments do not nucleate spontaneously in vivo owing to the presence of the monomer - binding proteins proﬁlin and thymosin - b 4 . These two proteins work together to maintain a pool of actin ready to polymerize upon the creation of barbed ends ( for review , see Pollard et al . 2000 ) . Owing to the abundance of monomeric actin , diﬀusion does not seem to limit the polymeriza - tion process , although direct experimental evidence is lacking . In fact , the possibility of limitation by diﬀusion has been suggested theoretically ( Noireaux et al . 2000 ; Mogilner and Edelstein - Keshet 2002 ) , and a recent FLAP ( ﬂuorescence localization after photobleaching ) study found that diﬀusion was not suﬃcient to explain actin delivery to protruding zones in cells ( Zicha et al . 2003 ) . We show here the ﬁrst experimental evidence that , under certain conditions , diﬀusion of actin monomers is a limiting factor in the growth of an actin gel . For our study , we took advantage of the well - characterized Listeria monocytogenes system , a bacterium that assembles actin ﬁlaments at one pole , thereby pushing itself forward within the infected cell . The same proteins as those implicated in leading edge dynamics are involved in this movement : the bacterially produced ActA protein activates actin polymerization nucleation Eur Biophys J ( 2004 ) 33 : 310 – 320 DOI 10 . 1007 / s00249 - 003 - 0370 - 3 J .

Inspired by Listeria , our experimental system consists of beads coated with ActA or ActA fragments , placed in cell extracts . Similar systems have already permitted physical studies of actin - based motil - ity in pure protein mixtures ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . 2002 ) , the identiﬁcation of biochemical partners for ac - tin polymerization ( Fradelizi et al . 2001 ) , structural characterizations ( Cameron et al . 2001 ) and the deﬁni - tion of requirements for directional motility ( Cameron et al . 1999 ) . Here we use the bead system to compare , in a controlled manner , growing actin gels produced by ActA or fragments of ActA that interact with either VASP or the Arp2 / 3 complex . With a theoretical anal - ysis of gel thickness data obtained by electron micros - copy , we derive the values of three important physical parameters : the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of actin monomers ( D ) , the rate of depolymerization at ﬁlament pointed ends ( k p (cid:1) ) and the elastic modulus of the gel ( C ) . VASP - dependent actin network formation is observed for the ﬁrst time at the microscopic scale . Materials and methods Proteins Glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusions of the N - terminal domain of ActA ( NT ) , amino acids 1 – 234 , and the C - terminal domain ( PRO ) , amino acids 235 – 584 , were prepared as previously described ( Golsteyn et al . 1997 ) and dialyzed into 100 mM borate buﬀer ( pH 8 . 5 ) . Full - length ActA ( amino acids 1 – 584 ) equipped with a GST and a 6 · his tag was puriﬁed as described ( Noireaux et al . 2000 ) . Amino acids are numbered according to Kocks et al . ( 1992 ) . HeLa cell extracts HeLa cell extracts were prepared following general guidelines established for platelet extract preparation ( Laurent and Carlier 1998 ) . The human HeLa S3 cell line was grown in suspension in Dulbecco (cid:1) s minimal essential medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , under 5 % CO 2 at 37 (cid:2) C . A total of 10 10 cells were washed twice with PBS and then twice with Wash Buﬀer ( 135 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 11 . 9 mM NaHCO 3 , 0 . 36 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 5 . 5 mM glucose and 0 . 3 % BSA , pH 6 . 5 ) . Centrifugations were performed at 800 · g , for 5 – 10 min at 4 (cid:2) C . The wet volume of cells was approximately 20 mL . The cells were then resuspended in 15 mL sonication buﬀer ( 10 mM Tris , 10 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 5 ) with protease inhibitors ( Sigma protease inhibitor cocktail for mammalian tis - sues , diluted 1 : 100 ) . The cell suspension was passed 10 – 20 times in a cell cracker at 4 (cid:2) C in batches of 5 mL , and the homogenate was then centrifuged at 17 , 000 · g for 20 min at 4 (cid:2) C . The supernatant was transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube ; care was taken to avoid the lipid layer ﬂoating on the surface . This supernatant was then re - centrifuged at 118 , 000 · g for 1 h at 4 (cid:2) C . Again care was taken to avoid the grease layer and the solution was supplemented with DTT and ATP to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mM each . The total volume of extract was approximately 10 mL . The extract was ali - quoted , ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ) 80 (cid:2) C . For actin polymerization reactions , aliquots of extract were thawed , supplemented again with 1 mM ATP , 30 mM creatine phosphate and 1 l M ﬂuorescent actin - Alexa from rabbit muscle ( Molecular Probes ) and ultracentrifuged at 140 , 000 · g for 10 min at 4 (cid:2) C . Total protein concentration , as measured by Bradford assay with a BSA standard , after this second ultracentrifugation was about 17 mg / mL . Characterization of HeLa extracts The concentrations of actin , the Arp2 / 3 complex and VASP in HeLa cell extracts were evaluated by quantitative Western blot . For these measurements , extract aliquots were thawed and ultra - centrifuged as above , but no supplements were added . Human non - muscle actin ( cytoskeleton ) , bovine Arp2 / 3 complex and human VASP ( kind gifts from Marie - France Carlier ) were used as stan - dards . 10 % gels of extracts and protein standards were blotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with primary antibodies : mono - clonal anti - b - actin ( Sigma ) , monoclonal anti - human VASP ( Transduction Laboratories ) and polyclonal anti - p41 Arc , a sub - unit of the Arp2 / 3 complex . This latter antibody , a gift from Henry Higgs , was made against the C - terminal ten amino acids of human p41 Arc , which is identical in the bovine complex ( Robinson et al . 2001 ) . Blots were developed using alkaline phosphatase or the Ampliﬁed Opti - 4CN detection kit ( Biorad ) . Bands were quantiﬁed using the Bio - Proﬁl Imaging System ( Vilber Lourmat , France ) , and standards were ﬁt to a logarithmic curve to calculate protein con - centrations in extract samples . Bead preparation All beads were purchased from Polyscience . We used polystyrene beads of diameter ranging from 0 . 5 to 25 l m . Beads were washed twice with borate buﬀer ( 100 mM , pH 8 . 5 ; Polyscience ) before protein coating . A quantity of 0 . 5 – 1 nmol of protein in a volume of 10 – 80 l L was incubated with a total bead surface of about 15 cm 2 . The reaction was incubated for 3 h at room temperature with gentle agitation . Beads were resuspended in 50 l L of 10 mg / mL BSA in borate ( Polyscience ) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature to further ensure that all the bead surface was covered with protein . Beads were then washed and stored in storage buﬀer ( 20 mM sodium phosphate , 150 mM NaCl , 10 mg / mL BSA , 0 . 1 % NaN 3 , 5 % glycerol , pH 7 . 4 ; Polyscience ) at 4 (cid:2) C and used within 24 h [ note that the proteins are grafted by adsorption onto the bead surface in the current study , whereas covalent attachment was used by Noireaux et al . ( 2000 ) ] . To measure the protein concentration on the bead surface , a quantity of beads giving about 12 cm 2 total surface was washed in borate buﬀer , resuspended in SDS sample buﬀer and heated at 100 (cid:2) C for 10 min to ensure detachment and denaturation of all proteins . Bead samples were loaded on 7 % gels , along with BSA standards . Protein bands were quantiﬁed by comparison to BSA standards using the Bio - Proﬁl Imaging System . Protein amounts were converted to density values by taking into account the exact surface area of beads loaded on the gel and using the following molecular weights : GST - ActA - His , 90 kDa ; GST - NT , 52 kDa ; and GST - PRO , 64 kDa . All three proteins were at maximal surface concentration , corresponding to a distance between protein mole - cules on the surface of 16 . 9±3 . 5 nm for ActA - coated beads , 7 . 5±0 . 9 nm for NT - coated beads and 8 . 9±1 . 5 nm for PRO - coated beads . Fluorescence microscopy of beads VASP recruitment to bead surfaces was evaluated by incubating 0 . 5 l m radius beads in extract treated with 5 l M latrunculin A ( Molecular Probes ) to prevent actin polymerization . The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min , before being pro - bed with monoclonal anti - human VASP ( Transduction Laborato - ries ) and then with Texas Red secondary antibody ( Santa Cruz 311 Biotechnology ) . For the control reaction , the primary antibody was omitted . Beads were imaged at 100 times magniﬁcation on an Olympus inverted microscope equipped with an intensiﬁed CCD camera ( Lhesa , France ) . All images were taken at identical expo - sure , and ﬂuorescence intensities at bead surfaces were quantiﬁed using Metamorph software ( Universal Imaging ) . At least 10 beads were evaluated for each measurement , and the background next to each bead was subtracted . To observe actin treadmilling over time , we acquired images ( 1 s exposure ) every 5 min with a Leica inverted microscope equipped with a CCD camera ( Princeton Instruments ) , and ﬂuo - rescence intensities were quantiﬁed as above . Reactions for electron microscopy For reactions using beads of diﬀerent sizes , it is important that the total surface area for actin polymerization remain constant . Derivatized beads at a total bead surface of 0 . 83 cm 2 ( for example , 4 . 94 l L of 9 . 634 l m beads at a concentration of 2 . 7 % ) were wa - shed in 50 mM phosphate buﬀer ( pH 6 . 3 ) and then resuspended in 50 l L prepared HeLa extract . Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 4 h without agitation . Beads were pelleted in a horizontal centrifuge at 2000 · g for 10 min at room temperature . The pellet surface was washed twice with cold CB buﬀer ( 10 mM MES , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM glucose , pH 6 . 1 ) , and processed immediately for epon inclusion . Epon inclusion and electron microscopy Washed bead pellets were ﬁxed in glutaraldehyde and tannic acid , rinsed with buﬀer , post - ﬁxed with osmium , water washed and stained with 2 % uranyl acetate as previously described ( Noireaux et al . 2000 ) , except that , for all steps , CB buﬀer was substituted for phosphate buﬀer . Samples were then dehydrated in alcohol and embedded in epon . Ultrathin sections ( 80±10 nm ) were stained for 20 min with 4 % uranyl acetate , washed three times with water and then incubated for 1 – 3 min in lead citrate . Grids were analyzed on a Philips CM 120 electron microscope at 80 kV . Gel thicknesses on bead surfaces were measured using Metamorph software . Thick - ness measurements were performed on beads that had been sec - tioned through the center , and each thickness represents the average of at least 10 beads chosen at random . Results Actin ﬁlaments accumulate around beads coated with ActA and ActA variants Three constructs of the ActA protein of Listeria are studied : full - length ActA , the N - terminal domain of ActA ( NT ) , which binds Arp2 / 3 , and the C - terminal domain of ActA ( PRO ) , which binds VASP . When these proteins are adsorbed onto the surface of polystyrene beads and incubated in HeLa cell extracts doped with ﬂuorescently labeled actin monomer , symmetrical actin clouds are observed around all three types of beads by ﬂuorescence microscopy , as already described by Noi - reaux et al . ( 2000 ) for ActA and by Fradelizi et al . ( 2001 ) for PRO and a homologue of NT ( VCA ) . Plastic embedding and thin sectioning , followed by observation by electron microscopy , conﬁrms the presence of ﬁla - mentous actin around the beads . As shown in Fig . 1a – c for 7 . 9 l m radius beads , the three ActA constructs produce diﬀerent actin structures at the surface of the beads . The NT - produced gel is a loose , fragmented meshwork , while the gel generated by full - length ActA is denser and more regular . PRO - coated beads interact with VASP , as shown by immunoﬂuorescence ( Fig . 2 ) . These beads produce a tight dense actin gel , unlike control beads coated with BSA that do not show any actin accumulation at the surface ( Fig . 1d ) . We rarely observe comet formation in these experiments , but with platelet extracts , beads coated with either ActA or NT display actin comets , although no movement is detected for beads coated with PRO ( J . Plastino , unpublished results ) . In this paper , we focus on spherical gel growth in HeLa cell extracts only . These extracts contain Fig . 1a – e Electron microscopy of thin sections of beads supporting a steady - state actin layer . Before incubation in cell extracts , beads are coated with an actin polymerization activator protein : ( a ) PRO , ( b ) ActA , ( c ) and ( e ) NT . ( a ) – ( c ) represent 7 . 9 l m radius beads ; ( e ) is a 0 . 3 l m radius bead ; ( d ) is the negative control : a 4 . 6 l m radius BSA - coated bead . Note the large open zones in the NT - produced gel on the 7 . 9 l m radius bead ( c ) . Bar : 500 nm 312 4±1 l M actin , 11±3 l M Arp2 / 3 and 50±20 nM VASP ( Table 1 ) . Under our reaction conditions ( see Materials and methods ) , actin and Arp2 / 3 are , thus , in large excess over nucleation activator on the bead sur - face , and VASP is present in approximately stoichiom - etric amounts . Dependence of gel thickness on bead size As seen in Fig . 1 , the three diﬀerent proteins produce actin accumulations of diﬀerent thicknesses . Increasing the reaction time from 4 to 6 hours for the ActA and PRO beads does not augment the observed thickness , indicating that the smaller thickness observed with these proteins is not due to diﬀerent speeds of accumulation . In addition , incubating the beads in a larger amount of extract or adding more extract at 4 h does not appre - ciably change the observed thickness , so the lack of further growth is not due to a depletion of extract components . Therefore we conclude that the thick - nesses observed in Fig . 1 represent the steady state of a treadmilling population of actin ﬁlaments : polymeriza - tion is still occurring at the barbed ends at the bead surface but it is balanced by depolymerization at the outer surface of the gel . Treadmilling of the actin cloud around ActA beads is conﬁrmed by adding ﬂuorescent actin to bead reactions run in the absence of ﬂuorescent label for 6 hours . We observe by video microscopy that ﬂuorescence is incorporated into the actin cloud , fully recovering the ﬂuorescence observed around control beads ( Fig . 3 ) ( Noireaux 2000 ) . From these observations , we can state that the sta - tionary gel thickness is dependent on the nature of the protein on the surface of the bead . Furthermore , we ﬁnd that , within a series of beads all coated with the same protein at the same surface density , the steady - state gel thickness is dependent on bead size .

The control represents beads treated exclu - sively with secondary antibody . Average ﬂuorescent intensities of the beads are shown in arbitrary units ( a . u . ) . PRO - coated beads bind VASP just as well as full - length ActA - coated beads , while NT - coated beads are indistinguishable from the control , as expected Table 1 Deﬁnition of symbols and summary of associated values Symbol Value Meaning Reference Not used 4±1 l M Actin concentration in HeLa extracts Measured in this paper Not used 11±3 l M Arp2 / 3 concentration in HeLa extracts Measured in this paper Not used 50±20 nM VASP concentration in HeLa extracts Measured in this paper k b þ 11 . 6 l M ) 1 s ) 1 Barbed end assembly rate constant ( Pollard 1986 ) k b (cid:1) 1 . 4 s ) 1 Barbed end disassembly rate constant ( Pollard 1986 ) k p (cid:1) 0 . 27 s ) 1 Pointed end disassembly rate constant ( Pollard 1986 ) 0 . 06 ± 0 . 02 s - 1 Pointed end disassembly rate constant in an ActA - produced gel , estimated from model Estimated in this paper c e 0 . 4 l M Monomeric actin available for polymerization , based on critical concentrations Critical concentrations barbed ( 0 . 12 l M ) and pointed ends ( 0 . 60 l M ) ( Pollard 1986 ) 0 . 27±0 . 03 l M Monomeric actin available for polymerization , estimated from model Estimated in this paper a 2 . 75 nm Filament length gained per monomer Estimation based on ( Holmes et al . 1990 ) l p 15 l m Persistance length of an actin ﬁlament ( Isambert et al . 1995 ; Ka¨s et al . 1996 ) and references therein n 23 – 36 nm Spacing between barbed ends in the lamellipodia of migrating ﬁbroblasts 1370±578 ends / l m 2 ( Abraham et al . 1999 ) 16 . 9±3 . 5 nm Spacing between barbed ends at the surface of an ActA - coated bead Measured in this paper ( ActA surface density ) D 3 . 1 · 10 ) 8 cm ) 2 s ) 1 Diﬀusion coeﬃcient of actin monomer in bulk cytoskeleton ( McGrath et al . 1998 ) 2 · 10 ) 8 cm ) 2 s ) 1 Diﬀusion coeﬃcient of actin monomer in an ActA - produced gel Estimated in this paper d £ 52 nm Pore size in the cytoplasmic actin gel of Swiss 3T3 cells ( Luby - Phelps et al . 1987 ) 53 nm Pore size of an ActA - produced actin gel Estimated in this paper C 10 3 – 10 4 Pa Elastic modulus of Listeria comet tail ( Gerbal et al . 2000 ) 8 · 10 3 Pa Elastic modulus of ActA - produced actin gel Estimated in this paper 313 NT - and PRO - coated beads is shown in Fig . 4 . These data are also summarized in Table 2 . ActA - coated beads , with radii r of up to 5 l m , dis - play gel thicknesses proportional to r ; however , for larger beads ( r > 5 l m ) , the gel thickness becomes inde - pendent of the bead radius . The implications of this proﬁle and the contribution of diﬀusion will be explained more thoroughly in the next section . For NT - coated beads , the dependence of gel thickness on bead radius does not level oﬀ at larger bead sizes . The standard deviation bars for larger beads coated with NT reﬂect the increasing irregularity of the actin gel ; large open zones are apparent around these beads , whereas for smaller beads the gel is more homogenous ( Fig . 1e ) . For 10 . 7 and 12 . 45 l m radius beads , the gels are too irregular to allow for thickness measurements . For PRO - coated beads , the thickness of the actin gel for beads of less than 2 l m in radius cannot be measured owing the small amount of actin around these beads . However , we can still observe that the PRO - generated gel thicknesses augment with larger bead sizes , reaching a plateau value of about 300 nm . Evaluation of actin gel properties by modeling gel thickness dependence on bead size As seen in Fig . 4 , ActA - coated beads , with radius r ranging from 0 . 25 to 5 l m , support steady - state actin gel thicknesses proportional to r as previously described and theoretically modeled ( Noireaux et al . 2000 ) . Interpre - tation of these results recognized the elastic properties of the actin gel . Because the actin ﬁlaments grow from a spherical surface , the actin gel has to deform to let monomers insert between the gel and the surface . This stretches the cross - linked gel , creating a stress orthogo - nal to the surface of the bead that prevents further addition of monomers , and a tangential stress that pulls on the outer gel layer and triggers fractures ( r ortho and r tang , Fig . 5 ) . The spherical constraint is less pronounced for beads of larger radii because they more closely approximate a ﬂat surface , and consequently these beads display thicker gels . It is predicted by Noireaux et al . ( 2000 ) that the gel thickness for larger ActA - coated beads will be limited by monomer diﬀusion . This eﬀect is seen in Fig . 4 , where the gel thickness becomes independent of the bead ra - dius for r > 5 l m . In this diﬀusion - limited regime , the thickness of the gel around the bead is such that it im - pedes the arrival of actin monomers at the surface . As a result , a radius - independent steady state is reached where diﬀusion to the bead surface followed by poly - merization is balanced by depolymerization at the outer surface of the gel . Note that the current data set is not superimposable with the experiments of Noireaux et al . ( 2000 ) owing to both a diﬀerent ActA grafting method ( see Materials and methods ) and an improvement in the extract preparation . In fact , the cell extracts in our study are 50 % higher in total protein . This concentration diﬀerence could aﬀect the polymerizing activity of the extracts , as has been observed with cell extracts from Xenopus eggs and platelets ( Laurent and Carlier 1998 ; Theriot and Fung 1998 ) . Nevertheless , the current and former data sets can be treated with the same theoretical analysis . Fig . 3 Demonstration of treadmilling in actin clouds around beads . 5 l m radius beads coated with ActA are incubated in cell extracts , and the increase of ﬂuorescence ( arbitrary units ) around the beads is monitored over time ( minutes ) . The solid line depicts the proﬁle obtained when the cell extracts contain ﬂuorescently marked monomeric actin at time 0 . The dashed line represents a bead incubated in extracts lacking ﬂuorescent actin for 6 h . Extract containing ﬂuorescent marker is then added , and as expected in a treadmilling situation , ﬂuorescent signal is incorporated into the actin gel around the bead . The two curves are normalized to a maximum ﬂuorescent signal of 1 Fig . 4 Gel thickness data as a function of bead size for NT - ( open triangles ) , ActA - ( open squares ) and PRO - coated beads ( ﬁlled diamonds ) incubated in HeLa cell extracts . For ActA and PRO , solid lines represent the ﬁts obtained using Eq . ( 9 ) . For the ActA - produced gel , the parameters e (cid:2) 0 , x 1 , x 2 and x 3 are generated by the ﬁt , and D and C are calculated from e (cid:2) 0 and x 3 , respectively . For the PRO - produced gel , x 1 and x 2 are ﬁxed to the values obtained for the ActA data ﬁt , but e (cid:2) 0 and x 3 are left free , and D and C are calculated accordingly . The linear increase for NT - beads data corresponds to a regime in which the open zones in the gel may allow more rapid diﬀusion of actin monomers to the bead surface 314 Diﬀusion can be evaluated by ﬁtting the thickness data as a function of bead size , as follows . We use the general equation ( Eq . 1 ) to describe the growth of an actin gel on a spherical surface . This equation is obtained as in Noireaux et al . ( 2000 ) by writing that depolymerization at the outer surface of the actin gel balances the polymerization at the inner surface , the actin monomers being transported by diﬀusion . We note D , the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of actin monomers within the gel , e , the actin gel thickness for a bead of radius r , and c e , the concentration of actin monomers available for polymerization in the cell extract , considered as constant outside the actin gel region : c e k b þ ð r ortho Þ 1 (cid:1) e (cid:1) e (cid:2) ð r tang Þ 1 þ e = r (cid:2) (cid:3) ¼ k b (cid:1) ð r ortho Þ þ k p (cid:1) ð r tang Þ ð 1 Þ We consider polymerization and depolymerization at the interior and exterior surfaces of the gel only , and neglect depolymerization in the body of the gel . This assumption appears true for ActA - and PRO - coated beads , which display essentially homogeneous gels , but not for NT - coated beads where the outer part of the gel body appears holey . k p (cid:1) is the depolymerization rate at the pointed end , taken as a constant by Noireaux et al . ( 2000 ) . Here , we take into account the dependence of k p (cid:1) upon the tangential stress r tang , a reasonable addition to the model since the gel is stretched at the outer surface . k b þ and k b (cid:1) are the polymerization and depolymerization rates at the barbed end , respectively , and are dependent upon the orthogonal stress , r ortho . The expression for e * ( r tang ) is : e (cid:2) r tang (cid:4) (cid:5) ¼ D n 2 c e k p (cid:1) r tang (cid:4) (cid:5) ð 2 Þ and represents the characteristic gel thickness for which diﬀusion becomes the limiting factor in gel polymeriza - tion ; n is the distance between nucleation promoting proteins on the surface of the bead , or in other words the distance between actin ﬁlaments polymerizing at the bead surface . When rearranged to give a description of gel thickness in terms of bead radius , and noting x = e / r , Eq . ( 1 ) gives : x ¼ e (cid:2) r tang (cid:4) (cid:5) r (cid:3) 1 þ x ð Þ (cid:3) 1 (cid:1) k b (cid:1) r ortho ð Þ þ k p (cid:1) r tang (cid:4) (cid:5) c e k b þ r ortho ð Þ (cid:2) (cid:3) ð 3 Þ Given that x is smaller than 1 , the tangential com - ponent of the stress can be expressed by : r tang = Cx ( Landau and Lifchitz 1976 ) , where C is the elastic modulus of the gel . Writing the equilibrium equation for the stress distribution as done by Noireaux et al . ( 2000 ) gives r ortho = Cx 2 . The stress - dependent rates k b þ ; k b (cid:1) and k p (cid:1) follow a Boltzmann law , as described by Kramers and Eyring rate theory ( Eyring 1935 ; Kramers 1940 ) ; n 2 r is the force acting on association or dissoci - ation of a monomer to / from a ﬁlament , and a is the distance over which the force is applied , i . e . the ﬁlament length gained per actin monomer ; k B and T are the Boltzmann constant and the temperature , respectively , and : Table 2 Actin gel thickness as a function of bead radius for ActA - , NT - and PRO - coated beads a n is the distance between pro - tein molecules on the surface of the bead ( see Materials and methods section ) .

Tangential ( r tang ) and orthogonal ( r ortho ) stress is created due to the stretching of the light gray layers over the newly formed black layer of F - actin .

From geo - metrical considerations , the distance between ﬁlaments at the exterior of the gel ( n e ) equals n ( 1 + x ) . The force acting on a single ﬁlament n 2e r tang is therefore equal to n 2 C x þ 2 x 2 (cid:4) (cid:5) , neglecting the third - order term . This gives the following expression for k p (cid:1) : k p (cid:1) r tang (cid:4) (cid:5) ¼ k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ exp a n 2e r tang 2 k B T (cid:2) (cid:3) ¼ k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ exp a n 2e C 2 k B T x þ 2 x 2 (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:3) ¼ k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ exp x þ 2 x 2 x 23 (cid:2) (cid:3) ð 7 Þ e * then reads : e (cid:2) r tang (cid:4) (cid:5) ¼ D n 2 c e k p (cid:1) r tang (cid:4) (cid:5) ¼ D n 2 c e k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ exp (cid:1) x þ 2 x 2 x 23 (cid:2) (cid:3) ð 8 Þ The presence of the factor 1 / 2 in the expressions for both depolymerization and polymerization ( Eqs . 5 , 6 , 7 ) assumes that the force aﬀects on and oﬀ rates equally at the barbed and pointed ends . We tested this assumption by radically changing the value of this factor to 1 and 0 for polymerization and depolymerization , respectively . This did not appreciably change the results of the ﬁt . Moreover , equal eﬀects of force on polymerization and depolymerization have been shown to be reasonable for microtubules , although the dominant eﬀect is neverthe - less ascribed to a reduction in the on rates ( Dogterom and Yurke 1997 ) . Combining Eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ) gives Eq .

As starting parameters for the ﬁt ( see Table 1 ) , the stress - free values for k b þ ; k b (cid:1) and k p (cid:1) are taken as 11 . 6 l M ) 1 s ) 1 , 1 . 4 s ) 1 and 0 . 27 s ) 1 , respectively ( Pollard 1986 ) . c e is deﬁned as 0 . 4 l M or 2 . 4 · 10 14 molecules / cm 3 , because it is intermediary between the critical concen - trations of the barbed and pointed ends , 0 . 12 l M and 0 . 60 l M , respectively ( Pollard 1986 ) . These parameters give input values for the ﬁt of x 1 (cid:4) 0 . 06 and x 2 (cid:4) 0 . 3 ; x 3 is loosely deﬁned as 0 . 1 – 10 , with the assumptions that a is in the nm range , n is in the tens of nm range and C is in the range 10 3 – 10 6 Pa . e (cid:2) 0 is taken to be on the order of 1 l m . All four ﬁtting parameters are left free during the ﬁt . For the ActA data , a Levenberg – Marquardt nonlin - ear least - squares ﬁtting routine generates the values for e (cid:2) 0 ; x 1 ; x 2 and x 3 , as shown in Table 3 . To reduce adjustable parameters , the ﬁt for the PRO data is ob - tained using parameters x 1 and x 2 as already deﬁned for ActA data , since less experimental data are available for the PRO - coated beads . This assumption implies that the stress - free values for k b þ ; k b (cid:1) and k p (cid:1) are similar in ActA - and PRO - produced gels . For k b þ and k b (cid:1) this is a valid assumption because these parameters are diﬀusion lim - ited ( Drenckhahn and Pollard 1986 ) , and therefore cannot be further augmented by interaction with the bead surface . For k p (cid:1) , the pointed ends of the ﬁlaments are not close to the surface , and therefore k p (cid:1) is unlikely to be directly aﬀected by the nucleation promoting protein . However , by recruiting diﬀerent cross - linking and bundling proteins to the actin gel , the activator protein on the bead could indirectly alter k p (cid:1) ; and , in this case , the x 1 found for the ActA data ﬁt would not be appropriate for PRO . Yet the ﬁt for the PRO data is reasonable , sustaining the use of ActA parameters for this analysis . The diﬀerence between the input values for x 1 and x 1 and the ones generated by the ﬁt indicates that some of the initial values of k b þ ð 0 Þ ; k b (cid:1) 0 ð Þ or c e are not appro - priate to our experimental situation . This disparity is normal , considering that the initial values are taken from purely in vitro estimations while our experiments are performed in cell extracts that contain proteins capable of altering the rate constants of actin assembly . As noted above , k b þ 0 ð Þ and k b (cid:1) 0 ð Þ cannot be further in - creased since their values correspond to diﬀusion - limited processes . We therefore use x 1 and x 1 to recalculate the values of k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ and c e , parameters known to be aﬀected by ADF / coﬁlin and capping proteins present in the cell ( for review , see Carlier 1998 ) . c e is recalculated from x 1 to give 0 . 27±0 . 03 l M , still intermediary between the critical concentrations of the barbed and pointed ends . 316 This value of c e and x 1 give k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ values of 0 . 06±0 . 02 s ) 1 , about ﬁve times less than the measured value in vitro . The ﬁtting procedure gives e (cid:2) 0 values of 1 . 6±0 . 1 and 0 . 7±0 . 1 l m for the curves corresponding to ActA - coated beads and PRO - coated - beads , respectively . To calculate D , we use the expression : e (cid:2) 0 ¼ D n 2 c e k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ ð 11 Þ with adjusted values for k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ and c e ( c e = 0 . 27± 0 . 03 l M = 1 . 6±0 . 5 · 10 14 cm ) 3 ) . The n values measured by SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 6 and Materials and methods ) for ActA and PRO adsorption to the bead surface are 16 . 9±3 . 5 nm and 8 . 9±1 . 5 nm , respectively , giving average D values of 2 · 10 ) 8 cm 2 / s ( with a range of 1 – 6 · 10 ) 8 cm 2 / s ) for actin monomers in the ActA - produced gel and 3 · 10 ) 8 cm 2 / s ( with a range of 1 – 9 · 10 ) 8 cm 2 / s ) for actin monomers in the PRO - produced gel . The elastic moduli ( C ) for the gels formed around ActA and PRO beads are calculated from the values of x 3 generated by the ﬁt ( see Table 3 ) and : x 23 ¼ 2 k B T a n 2 C ð 12 Þ k B T at room temperature is equal to 4 . 1 · 10 ) 21 N m , and the n values for ActA and PRO beads are as for the calculation of D . The value of a is deﬁned as half of an actin monomer or 2 . 75 nm : actin monomers polymerize with their large dimension of 5 . 5 nm parallel to the ﬁl - ament axis ( Holmes et al . 1990 ) , but since the ﬁlament is a double helix , each monomer only adds 2 . 75 nm to the length of the ﬁlament . We ﬁnd gel elasticities of 8 · 10 3 Pa ( with a range of 4 – 15 · 10 3 Pa ) in the case of the ActA - produced gel , and 1 · 10 6 Pa ( with a range of 0 . 6 – 1 . 9 · 10 6 Pa ) for the gel formed around the PRO - coated beads . These values and the reasonable assump - tion for dimensional arguments that C depends on the mesh size ( d ) of the gel by the relation : C (cid:4) k B Tl p d 4 ð 13 Þ ( Gerbal et al . 1999 ) allow us to estimate the value of d for the gels produced by the two nucleation activators . With the persistence length of an actin ﬁlament ( l p ) approximately equal to 15 l m ( Isambert et al . 1995 ; Ka¨s et al . 1996 and references therein ) , the mesh sizes are 53 nm for the ActA - produced gel and 16 nm for the PRO - produced gel . As shown in Fig . 4 , the NT - coated beads behave in a very diﬀerent manner : the gel thickness dependence on the radius is linear with no sign of leveling oﬀ , and , on large beads , the gels are much thicker than for the other two nucleation promoting proteins . Although the NT - produced actin gel is uneven around large beads ( Fig . 1c ) , it is more regular for smaller beads ( Fig . 1e ) , and we can therefore use the slope of the linear ﬁt to give an approximation of the elastic modulus of the NT - produced gel , as follows . The slope is related to the elastic modulus C by the formula : e r ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ D l C n 2 a s ð 14 Þ ( Noireaux et al . 2000 ) , where D l [ about 14 k B T ( Gordon et al . 1976 ) ] is the chemical energy released in the poly - merization process , and n and a are as previously deﬁned . The slope of the linear ﬁt to the NT data in Fig . 4 is 0 . 47±0 . 02 . With n equal to 7 . 5±0 . 9 nm , this Table 3 Fit parameters and results for ActA - and PRO - produced actin gels Nucleation promoting factor e (cid:2) 0 ( l m ) x 1 x 2 x 3 D ( cm 2 / s ) a average ( range ) C ( Pa ) a average ( range ) ActA 1 . 6±0 . 1 0 . 020±0 . 005 0 . 45±0 . 05 1 . 2±0 . 1 2 · 10 ) 8 8 · 10 3 ( 1 – 6 · 10 ) 8 ) ( 2 – 15 · 10 3 ) PRO 0 . 7±0 . 1 0 . 19±0 . 02 3 · 10 ) 8 1 · 10 6 ( 1 – 9 · 10 ) 8 ) ( 0 . 6 – 1 . 9 · 10 6 ) a Diﬀusion coeﬃcients ( D ) and gel elastic moduli ( C ) are calculated using n values of 16 . 9±3 . 5 nm and 8 . 9±1 . 5 nm for the distance between ActA and PRO proteins on the surface of the beads , respectively . For calculating D , we use k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ equal to 0 . 06±0 . 02 s ) 1 and c e equal to 1 . 6±0 . 2 · 10 14 molecules / cm 3 , as derived from the ﬁtting parameters x 1 and x 2 .

Beads coated with ( a ) ActA , ( b ) PRO and ( c ) NT and subsequently with BSA ( as described in Materials and methods ) are heated in sample buﬀer to release proteins from the bead surfaces , separated on a 7 % polyacrylamide gel , and stained with Coomassie . Protein amounts are calculated by comparing the band intensities for ActA , PRO and NT ( indicated by arrows ) to a BSA standard curve : ( d ) 5 , ( e ) 2 . 5 , ( f ) 1 . 25 , ( g ) 0 . 63 and ( h ) 0 . 31 l g 317 gives an estimate for C on the order of 1 – 24 · 10 5 Pa , comparable to that for the PRO - produced gel . Discussion Actin gels on spherical surfaces Our work on actin gels grown from the surface of beads has two main objectives . One is to study the eﬀect of nucleation promoting proteins on the physical proper - ties of the actin gel . The other is to test the elastic model by using it to estimate important parameters that govern gel growth : the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of actin monomers , the rate of depolymerization at ﬁlament pointed ends , and the elastic modulus of the actin gel . To address the ﬁrst question , we examine gel thicknesses for beads coated with ActA and with the ActA fragments PRO and NT . Because the C - terminal portion of ActA ( PRO ) binds VASP and the N - terminal part of ActA ( NT ) binds the Arp2 / 3 complex , these fragments allow us to separate the action of VASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex on actin assembly , and compare their individual activities . This study represents the ﬁrst microscopic observation of VASP - dependent actin gel formation . We show that the symmetrical gels generated by ActA and the fragments of ActA display diﬀerent thickness proﬁles in relation to bead size ( Fig . 1 , Fig . 4 and Table 2 ) . However , for all three variants , very small beads support a thinner actin layer than larger beads , a phenomenon due to the elastic properties of the actin gel , as explained in the Results section and in Fig . 5 . For ActA - and PRO - coated beads , the gel thickness is con - stant for large beads because the diﬀusion of monomers to the surface of the bead is the limiting factor in gel growth ( Results section ) . The curves for ActA - and PRO - gel thickness as a function of bead radius in Fig . 4 can be explained by a stress - limited regime followed by a diﬀu - sion - limited situation . The diﬀusion - limited regime is not observed for the NT - produced gel in the range of bead sizes used in this study , and the thickness measurements on larger bead sizes are impossible due to the high het - erogeneity of the gel ( Fig . 1c ) . The fact that these anfractuosities are absent from ActA - and PRO - pro - duced gels suggests that VASP could prevent gel break - ing . The interplay of VASP that produces unbranched ﬁlaments ( Bear et al . 2002 ) and Arp2 / 3 that gives bran - ched ﬁlaments could be important for a cohesive actin gel . ActA - , PRO - and NT - produced actin gel properties from thickness measurements By ﬁtting the complete data set of gel thickness as a function of bead size , we are able to calculate several important parameters for the ActA - produced actin gel : the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of actin monomer ( D ) , the elastic modulus of the ActA - produced gel ( C ) , and the rate of actin ﬁlament depolymerization at the pointed end [ k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ ] . See Table 1 for a summary of literature and calculated values . Our estimation for D of 2 · 10 ) 8 cm 2 / s is similar to the value previously measured by PAF ( photoactivation of ﬂuorescence ) in the bulk cytoskele - ton of subconﬂuent endothelial cells : 3 . 1±0 . 4 · 10 ) 8 cm 2 / s ( McGrath et al . 1998 ) . The diﬀusion coeﬃcient of G - actin in low - salt buﬀer is 7 . 15±0 . 35 · 10 ) 7 cm 2 / s ( Lanni and Ware 1984 ) . Adjusting for the four times higher viscosity of the ﬂuid phase of cytoplasm ( Luby - Phelps et al . 1986 ) , the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of actin monomer in cells or cell extract is expected to be about 1 . 8 · 10 ) 7 cm 2 / s . This estimate is ten times greater than what we actually ﬁnd in ActA - produced actin gels . In order to interpret this diﬀerence , we estimate the mesh size of the actin gel ( d ) using the elastic modulus value C . For the ActA gel , we ﬁnd C = 8 · 10 3 Pa , in agreement with previous measurements of the elasticity of Listeria comet tails ( Gerbal et al . 2000 ) . From this , we estimate the pore size of the actin gel at 53 nm , consis - tent with measurements in cells ( Luby - Phelps et al . 1987 ) . With an actin monomer size of 3 . 5 · 5 . 5 · 5 . 5 nm 3 ( Kabsch et al . 1990 ) and a pore size of 53 nm , actin monomer diﬀusion should not be mechanically impeded by the actin meshwork . The ten - fold reduction in dif - fusion of actin through the actin gel suggests , therefore , that monomers interact with the actin network during their diﬀusion to the barbed ends , and may attach temporarily to the network , thus slowing their diﬀusion . In theory , the calculated D could represent the diﬀusion of another protein , for example , both the Arp2 / 3 com - plex and VASP are recruited by ActA to the ﬁlament barbed ends . The size of the Arp2 / 3 complex is on the order of 15 · 14 · 7 – 10 nm 3 ( Robinson et al . 2001 ) , and VASP has a similar molecular weight to actin [ 46 kDa ( Reinhard et al . 1992 ) ] . Since 90 – 97 % of the diﬀusion space must be occluded in order to substantially reduce diﬀusion ( O¨lveczky and Verkman 1998 ) , both of these molecules are expected to diﬀuse through the gel unhindered , although , like actin , their motion could be slowed by temporary attachments to the actin network . However , given the reasonable values we obtain for D [ in accordance with the results of McGrath et al . ( 1998 ) ] , as well as for C , it is unlikely that we mistakenly mea - sured the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of some other species . The ﬁtting parameters x 1 and x 2 give us a novel way to evaluate the rate of actin ﬁlament depolymerization at the pointed end [ k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ ] . One would expect this param - eter to be enhanced from its in vitro value of 0 . 27 s ) 1 by the action of actin depolymerizing factors in the HeLa cell extract . Instead , we ﬁnd a k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ value of 0 . 06 s ) 1 , ﬁve times smaller than the in vitro value . A likely explanation for this small value is that the in vitro measurements were performed on solitary ﬁlaments , while , in the gel around the beads , the actin ﬁlaments are associated into a network by various bundling , cross - linking and branching factors in the cell extracts . The association points created by these factors may impede the depolymerization of pointed ends . In the same cell extract used for our experiments , another estimate of 318 k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ is found to be even lower : 1 l m beads coated with VCA , the Arp2 / 3 - interacting portion of WASP , display actin comets 10 . 5 l m in length with the beads moving at speeds of 3 . 4 l m / min ( A . Bernheim - Groswasser , unpublished results ) . By the ratio of velocity to length ( Theriot et al . 1992 ) , we calculate a k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ value of 0 . 005 s ) 1 , 50 times smaller than the in vitro value . This diﬀerence could again be due to the diﬀerent amount of branches and cross - links , aﬀecting pointed end depoly - merization . The parameters D , C and k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ all depend directly or indirectly on the spacing ( n ) between nucleation pro - moting factors on the surface of the bead , assuming that all molecules are active . This was previously shown to be true for VCA ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . 2002 ) and for N - WASP ( Wiesner et al . 2003 ) at an even smaller spacing . The diﬀerence between d and n can be justiﬁed by the fact that cross - links do not necessarily occur between neighboring ﬁlaments . The structural details of actin ﬁlament organization in the gel , treated theoretically , for example in Spiros and Edelstein - Ke - shet ( 1998 ) , are not developed in the current analysis where cross - linking is characterized only by the mesh size parameter . Gels around ActA - coated beads are relevant to the situation in the cell . The concentration of ActA on bead surfaces is similar to the density of barbed ends associ - ated with the front face of the lamellipodia in migrating ﬁbroblasts , n = 23 – 36 nm ( Abraham et al . 1999 ) . In addition , the ActA - generated gel , like the lamellipodia , involves both the Arp2 / 3 complex and VASP . Thus , the values measured for D , C and k p (cid:1) 0 ð Þ are biologically meaningful . The diﬀusion coeﬃcient for actin monomer in the PRO - produced gel is the same as for the ActA - produced gel , implying that this parameter is dependent only on the interactions of the diﬀusing actin monomer with actin ﬁlaments , and independent of the presence or absence of Arp2 / 3 and VASP . The elastic modulus of the gel produced by PRO is 100 times larger than the ActA - produced gel . This gives a mesh size value that is three times smaller for the PRO - generated gel , in qual - itative agreement with the images in Fig . 1 , a , b ) . In or - der to estimate the elastic modulus for the NT - produced gel , we use a linear ﬁt of the data in Fig . 4 . Owing to the error bars on the large radii beads , this estimate is only representative of the small radii beads where the gel is more regular ( Fig . 1e ) , and we obtain an elasticity value that is comparable to the PRO gel . For larger NT - coated beads the gel appears porous ( Fig . 1c ) , implying that the gel elasticity becomes inhomogeneous with increasing bead radius , and preventing us from inter - preting these points ( r ‡ 3 l m ) in terms of the stress - limited model . Furthermore , NT - nucleated actin growth does not enter a diﬀusion - limited regime in the range of bead sizes studied , unlike the ActA and PRO systems , as seen in Fig . 4 . This might indicate that diﬀusion through the NT - produced gel is more rapid , perhaps due to the presence of anfractuosities in the gel . The increased porosity of the NT - produced gel away from the bead surface may explain why comets are not visible for Listeria expressing NT in place of ActA in infected cells , despite the fact that these bacteria are motile ( Lasa et al . 1997 ) . Conclusions Using a well - controlled experimental set - up , we show clear evidence that actin monomer diﬀusion can play an important role in actin assembly at surfaces . Here , dif - fusion limits actin gel growth , a restriction that cells might have to over - ride by using other transport mech - anisms ( Zicha et al . 2003 ) . The values we estimate for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of monomers and the elastic moduli of diﬀerent actin gels are biologically relevant , and corroborate the elastic model for actin gel growth . Our value for the depolymerization rate at the pointed end unveils the important role of reticulation in stabilizing the ﬁlaments constituting the gel .
