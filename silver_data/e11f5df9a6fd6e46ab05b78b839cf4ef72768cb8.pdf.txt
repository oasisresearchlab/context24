ORIGINAL ARTICLE Flotillins as regulators of ErbB2 levels in breast cancer S Pust 1 , 2 , TI Klokk 1 , 2 , N Musa 1 , 2 , M Jenstad 2 , 3 , B Risberg 2 , 3 , 4 , B Erikstein 5 , L Tcatchoff 1 , 2 , K Liestøl 2 , HE Danielsen 2 , 3 , B van Deurs 6 and K Sandvig 1 , 2 , 7 Ampliﬁcation and overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 occur in up to 30 % of human breast cancers , and high ErbB2 levels are correlated with poor prognosis for breast cancer patients . In contrast to the epithelial growth factor receptor ( ErbB1 ) , ErbB2 is not downregulated by ligand - induced mechanisms . Here we show that ﬂotillins are involved in the stabilization of ErbB2 at the plasma membrane . In SKBR3 breast cancer cells and breast cancer tissue , a positive correlation between ﬂotillin and ErbB2 expression levels could be demonstrated . Moreover , the tissue microarray analyses of biopsies from 194 patients diagnosed with carcinomas of the breast showed that ﬂotillin - 2 emerged as a potential predictor of prognosis in breast cancer . Depletion of ﬂotillin - 1 and ﬂotillin - 2 leads to internalization and degradation of ErbB2 . Furthermore , ﬂotillin - 1 and - 2 were found to be in a molecular complex with ErbB2 and Hsp90 . The depletion of one of these proteins results in disruption of this complex , followed by destabilization of ErbB2 at the membrane , and its internalization and degradation . As a consequence , ErbB2 - triggered downstream signalling is inhibited . Our data demonstrate a novel mechanism for interfering with ErbB2 signalling , which potentially can have clinical impact . Oncogene ( 2013 ) 32 , 3443 – 3451 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / onc . 2012 . 357 ; published online 6 August 2012 Keywords : ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase ; ﬂotillin ; breast cancer ; endocytosis ; downregulation INDRODUCTION The ligand - less receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 is a preferred dimerization partner for the other members ( EGFR / ErbB1 , ErbB3 and ErbB4 ) of the EGFR ( epithelial growth factor receptor ) family . 1 ErbB2 has been demonstrated to enable strong and constitutive signalling through different pathways that induce cell transformation , migration and proliferation . 2 In contrast to EGFR / ErbB1 , ErbB2 is endocytosed at a very slow rate and continuously recycled back to the cell surface . 3 – 5 The precise activation and deactivation of signalling cascades is a crucial cellular process and dysregulation can induce cancer development or progression . Thus , one of the challenges in cancer treatment is to promote silencing of signalling cascades . ErbB2 has been shown to be involved in the progression and development of a variety of different human tumours . Remarkably , in up to 20 – 30 % of all human breast cancers , ampliﬁcation and overexpression of ErbB2 can be found and high expression of ErbB2 has been demon - strated to be correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients . 6 – 9 The inhibition of oncogenic signalling triggered by ErbB2 can be achieved by different strategies , and administration of monoclonal antibodies ( trastuzumab / Herceptin ) became the ﬁrst - line treatment in patients with ErbB2 - overexpressing metastatic breast cancer . 6 , 10 In breast cancer cells , ErbB2 is strongly concentrated at the plasma membrane and its stabilization at the membrane is mediated by Hsp90 . Thus , another approach to abrogate oncogenic signalling is the induction of ErbB2 internalization and degradation by inhibition of Hsp90 . Treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin ( GA ) has been shown to induce ErbB2 downregulation . 11 – 13 Hsp90 is a known target in cancer therapy and GA analogues ( for example , 17 - AAG / tanespimycin ) are used in the treatment and therapy of ErbB2 - positive cancers in clinic . 14 – 16 To understand in greater detail how ErbB2 stabilization at the plasma membrane is mediated , we have investigated the involvement of the lipid raft - associated ﬂotillins ( ﬂotillin - 1 and - 2 ) in this process . Flotillins , which are also termed reggies , 17 have been described to be localized mainly at the plasma membrane and in endosomal / lysosomal compartments . 18 – 20 It has been demonstrated that ﬂotillin proteins , among other functions , are involved in endocytic mechanisms and cellular trafﬁcking processes . 21 – 23 In this study , we describe how ﬂotillin - 1 and - 2 contribute to the stabilization of ErbB2 at the cell surface , and we show that ErbB2 is internalized and degraded by a GA - independent mechanism upon ﬂotillin depletion . Importantly , ﬂotillin and ErbB2 expression levels are positively correlated on a cellular level as well as in breast cancer tissue . RESULTS Association of ﬂotillins with ErbB2 First , we analysed the cellular localization of ErbB2 and ﬂotillins in SKBR3 breast cancer cells . We could show by confocal microscopy that ﬂotillin - 1 and - 2 partially co - localize with ErbB2 at the plasma membrane ( Figure 1a ) . In addition , interaction between ﬂotillins and ErbB2 could be demonstrated by co - immunoprecipitation experiments , as immunoprecipitation of endogenous ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 resulted in pull down of ErbB2 ( Figure 1b , quantiﬁcation of pull down see Supplementary Figure S1a ) . We next analysed the impact of ﬂotillins on the internalization and subsequent degradation of ErbB2 . As described above , ErbB2 is stably 1 Department of Biochemistry , Institute for Cancer Research , Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway ; 2 Centre for Cancer Biomedicine , Faculty of Medicine , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway ; 3 Institute for Medical Informatics , Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway ; 4 Department of Pathology , Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway ; 5 Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway ; 6 Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine , The Panum Building , Faculty of Health Sciences , University of Copenhagen , Copenhagen , Denmark and 7 Department of Molecular Biosciences , Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway .

Western blot analysis of ErbB2 degradation and treatment of SKBR3 cells with 3 m M GA showed , as expected , a rapid decrease of ErbB2 levels within 2 – 4h . However , protein levels of ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 and their intracellular localization were not affected by GA treatment ( Supplementary Figures S1c and d ) . Importantly , internalization of ErbB2 could be observed by confocal micro - scopy when cells were depleted for ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 , in the absence of GA ( Figures 2a and b ) . The percentage of cells with internalized ErbB2 signiﬁcantly increases after depletion of ﬂotillins ( Supplementary Figure S1e ) . Interestingly , after ﬂotillin depletion , ErbB2 is found to be localized in Lamp - 1 - positive vesicles ( Supplementary Figure S1f ) , supporting the data showing reduced levels of ErbB2 after ﬂotillin knockdown . To investigate whether there is a correlation between the levels of membrane - associated ErbB2 and ﬂotillin , we performed confocal microscopy studies in ﬂotillin knockdown cells . Analysis of the ﬂuorescence intensities of extracellular ErbB2 and total ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 showed approximately linear relationships ( Figures 2c and d ) with good correlations , especially for ﬂotillin - 2 ( ﬂotillin - 1 : R ¼ 0 . 647 , ﬂotillin - 2 : R ¼ 0 . 855 ) . To measure the direct uptake of ErbB2 after ﬂotillin depletion , we labelled ErbB2 with speciﬁc antibodies on ice and incubated the cells at 37 1 C for 30 min . Afterwards , cells were ﬁxed and stained for ErbB2 and ErbB2 internalization was visualized by confocal microscopy ( Figure 2e ) . As expected , control cells showed no uptake of ErbB2 within 30min , whereas in GA - treated cells as well as in ﬂotillin - depleted cells ( Figure 2e , arrowheads ) , intracellular ErbB2 could be detected . These data suggest that ﬂotillins stabilize ErbB2 at the plasma membrane and thereby inhibit its degradation . Consequently , we examined by western blot analysis whether ﬂotillin knockdown triggers ErbB2 degradation . For this purpose , SKBR3 were depleted of either ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 and subsequently incubated with or without 3 m M GA for 2h ( Figures 3a and b ) . The results revealed that knockdown of ﬂotillin - 2 resulted in a stronger reduction of ErbB2 ( B 40 % ) than depletion of ﬂotillin - 1 ( B 20 % ) , and the reduction after ﬂotillin - 2 depletion is comparable to the effect obtained upon treatment with GA alone . To analyse in more detail the interaction of ﬂotillins with ErbB2 , we studied the association of ErbB2 with ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 in response to GA treatment . To achieve this , we performed an in situ proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) with the DuolinkII kit ( Olink Bioscience , Uppsala , Sweden ) . This established method relies on antibody - based analysis and quantiﬁcation of protein proximity by ﬂuorescence microscopy . 24 , 25 Brieﬂy , after an ampliﬁcation reaction , proteins of interest with a distance of less than 40 nm from each other can be visualized by ﬂuorescence microscopy as distinct ﬂuorescent dots , suggesting an association or complex of these proteins . By this assay , we could demonstrate a close proximity between ﬂotillins and ErbB2 receptors ( Figure 3c ) . This proximity was disrupted upon GA treatment , as a signiﬁcantly reduced level of ﬂotillin / ErbB2 signals was observed in GA - treated cells ( Figure 3d ) . Importantly , the speciﬁc association of ErbB2 and ﬂotillins is supported by a control experiment analysing proximity of ErbB2 with the membrane protein Par - 2 ( Supplementary Figure S2a ) . Figure 1 . ErbB2 receptors are co - localizing and interacting with ﬂotillin proteins . ( a ) ErbB2 is partially co - localized with ﬂotillin - 1 and - 2 at the cell surface . SKBR3 breast cancer cells were immunostained for endogenous ErbB2 , ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 , nuclei were stained by DAPI . The samples were visualized by confocal microscopy . Yellow lines in the merged pictures indicate the regions highlighted as ﬂuorescence intensity proﬁles on the right . Scale bars , 20 m m . ( b ) Interaction of ErbB2 and Hsp90 with ﬂotillin - 1 and - 2 . SKBR3 cells were lysed , ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 were immunoprecipitated and ErbB2 or Hsp90 were subsequently detected by western blot analysis . The two upper panels show the detection of immunocomplexes consisting of ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 and Hsp90 or ErbB2 , respectively . The lower panels show the input of ErbB2 , Hsp90 , ﬂotillin - 1 and - 2 . Flotillins stabilize ErbB2 at the plasma membrane S Pust et al 3444 Oncogene ( 2013 ) 3443 – 3451 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited No interaction of these proteins has been reported so far . However , by using PLA , a signiﬁcant number of ErbB2 / Par - 2 signals per cell can be detected but the number of signals is not changed by GA treatment . This indicates that the ErbB2 / Par - 2 signals are probably due to the close spatial distribution of the two highly expressed membrane proteins rather than speciﬁc association of ErbB2 with Par - 2 . On the other hand , ErbB2 / ﬂotillin proximity is sensitive to GA treatment , indicating a speciﬁc association of ErbB2 and ﬂotillins . Moreover , the number of ﬂotillin - 2 / Par - 2 proximity signals are 70 % reduced compared with the number of ErbB2 / Par - 2 signals ( (cid:2) GA ) . Flotillins associate with Hsp90 in an ErbB2 - dependent manner As already mentioned , Hsp90 is an essential component for the stabilization of ErbB2 at the plasma membrane . 26 Thus , we tested whether ﬂotillins interact with Hsp90 or regulate Hsp90 protein levels . By co - immunoprecipitation , we could show that ﬂotillins interact with Hsp90 ( Figure 1b ) . These ﬁndings were in agreement with a partial co - localization of ﬂotillins and Hsp90 at the plasma membrane , visualized by confocal microscopy ( Figure 4a ) . Based on these results , we investigated whether ﬂotillins regulate Hsp90 protein levels and thereby stabilize ErbB2 receptors at the plasma membrane . However , depletion of ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 or ﬂotillin double Figure 2 . GA treatment and ﬂotillin depletion results in internalization and reduced levels of ErbB2 . ( a ) Flotillin - 1 depletion triggers internalization of ErbB2 . SKBR3 cells were transfected with control or ﬂotillin - 1 - targeting siRNA oligonucleotides , proteins were stained by speciﬁc antibodies and visualized by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy . After ﬂotillin - 1 knockdown , intracellular ErbB2 could be detected as dotted structures ( arrowheads ) . Scale bar , 20 m m . ( b ) ErbB2 internalization in ﬂotillin - 2 - depleted cells . SKBR3 cells were transfected with control or ﬂotillin - 2 - targeting siRNA oligonucleotides and treated as described above . Similar to after ﬂotillin - 1 knockdown , intracellular ErbB2 appeared as dotted structures after depletion of ﬂotillin - 2 ( arrowheads ) . Scale bar , 20 m m . ( c ) Representative correlation of extracellular ErbB2 and ﬂotillin - 1 levels . SKBR3 cells depleted of ﬂotillin - 1 were ﬁxed and non - permeabilized cells were stained for extracellular ErbB2 , followed by permeabilization and staining for ﬂotillin - 1 . For further analysis the ﬂuorescence intensities of ErbB2 and ﬂotillin - 1 were measured . The calculated R - value was 0 . 647 ( n ¼ 71 ; P o 0 . 05 ) . ( d ) Representative correlation of extracellular ErbB2 and ﬂotillin - 2 levels . Cells were depleted for ﬂotillin - 2 and treated and analysed as described in c . The calculated R - value was 0 . 855 ( n ¼ 77 ; P o 0 . 05 ) . ( e ) Internalization of antibody - labelled ErbB2 . Cells were transfected with control or ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 - targeting siRNA oligonucleotides and incubated for additional 3 days . Afterwards , cells were labelled on ice with an ErbB2 - speciﬁc antibody followed by 30min incubation at 37 1 C , methanol ﬁxation and detection of ErbB2 via ﬂuorescently labelled secondary antibodies . Analysis by confocal microscopy showed internalized ErbB2 after GA treatment and ﬂotillin depletion ( indicated by arrowheads ) , but no ErbB2 internalization in control cells . Scale bars , 10 m m . Flotillins stabilize ErbB2 at the plasma membrane S Pust et al 3445 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2013 ) 3443 – 3451 knockdown did not signiﬁcantly alter total Hsp90 levels ( Figure 4b ) . Next , we analysed the role of ErbB2 with respect to the association of ﬂotillin with Hsp90 . In agreement with our data obtained by immunoprecipitation , Hsp90 is in close proximity to ﬂotillin - 1 and - 2 , as determined by PLA , and the level of detectable Hsp90 / ﬂotillin proximity signals were strongly reduced by admin - istration of the Hsp90 inhibitor GA ( Figures 4c and d ; control cells ) . Interestingly , also ErbB2 depletion ( B 70 % decreased protein levels , Supplementary Figure S2a ) reduced the level of Hsp90 / ﬂotillin proximity signals ( Figures 4c and d ) , and this reduction was comparable to the effect induced by GA in control cells . However , depletion of ErbB2 had no effect on ﬂotillin or Hsp90 protein levels ( Figure 4e ) . Altogether , our data indicate that ﬂotillins interact , directly or indirectly , with ErbB2 and Hsp90 at the plasma membrane . Flotillin depletion leads to reduced ErbB2 / Hsp90 interaction , ErbB2 phosphorylation and Akt signalling Next , we tested by PLA how depletion of ﬂotillin proteins affects the proximity of ErbB2 and Hsp90 . In control cells , GA treatment for 2h led to signiﬁcantly reduced ErbB2 / Hsp90 proximity signals ( Figure 5a and Supplementary Figure S2b ) . Interestingly , also depletion of ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 resulted in a reduced level of ErbB2 / Hsp90 proximity signals . Noteworthy , GA treatment in combina - tion with ﬂotillin knockdown did not signiﬁcantly change ErbB2 / Hsp90 proximity signals compared with ﬂotillin knockdown alone . In accordance with this ﬁnding , rescue of ﬂotillin protein levels , by transfection of siRNA - resistant genes , resulted in a recovery of the ErbB2 / Hsp90 interaction ( Supplementary Figures S2c and d ) . After demonstrating that ﬂotillin depletion triggers internaliza - tion and downregulation of ErbB2 , we analysed whether ﬂotillin depletion impairs the activation of ErbB2 - induced signalling pathways . ErbB2 has been described as the only member of the ErbB tyrosine kinase receptor family without any known ligand . However , ErbB2 is a preferred dimerization partner for all of the other ErbB proteins . Dimer formation results in phosphorylation of the dimer partners and triggers the activation of signalling pathways . 27 Among several others , the two major pathways induced by ErbB dimers are the Ras / MAPK and the PI3K / Akt pathway , both involved in stimulating cell proliferation and tumour cell survival . 1 , 2 First , we analysed whether depletion of ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 changed the phosphorylation status of ErbB2 receptors . The activation status of ErbB2 was determined by quantiﬁcation of p - ErbB2 ( Tyr1248 ) levels by SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS – PAGE ) ( Figure 5b ) . The residue Tyr 1248 is the major phosphorylation site of ErbB2 and p - ErbB2 ( Tyr1248 ) has been described as a predictor of poor prognosis in breast cancer . 28 Analysis of our data indicated that the levels of p - ErbB2 ( Tyr1248 ) were signiﬁcantly reduced after depletion of ﬂotillins . Knockdown of ﬂotillin - 1 led to a 40 % reduction , knockdown of ﬂotillin - 2 led to a 65 % reduction in p - ErbB2 levels ( Figures 5b and c ) , and Figure 3 . Depletion of ﬂotillins leads to reduced ErbB2 levels and association of ﬂotillins with ErbB2 is dependent on Hsp90 . ( a ) Quantiﬁcation of ErbB2 levels . Control , ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 knockdown cells were treated with 3 m M GA for 2h or left untreated , lysed and analysed by SDS – PAGE . ErbB2 levels were quantiﬁed and showed to be signiﬁcantly reduced upon ﬂotillin depletion and GA treatment . Signiﬁcances for GA - free conditions are indicated ( * P o 0 . 05 ) .

( c ) Detection of ﬂotillin / ErbB2 proximity by ﬂuorescent microscopy using in situ PLA . SKBR3 cells were pretreated for 2h with 3 m M GA , or left untreated , incubated with primary antibodies against ErbB2 and ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 and processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions .

Flotillins stabilize ErbB2 at the plasma membrane S Pust et al 3446 Oncogene ( 2013 ) 3443 – 3451 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited administration of GA for 2h resulted in B 90 % reduction of the pErbB2 levels . Interestingly , treatment of cells with GA or depletion of ﬂotillins resulted in a signiﬁcantly stronger reduction of p - ErbB2 levels compared with the reduction of total ErbB2 . Furthermore , we investigated the inﬂuence of ﬂotillin - induced ErbB2 downregulation on Akt signalling . ErbB2 is able to bind to PI3K , inducing phosphorylation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and the subsequent recruitment of Akt kinase , the main effector of PI3K . Upon activation , Akt phosphorylates several downstream targets that lead to tumour cell survival and anti - apoptotic signalling . 29 , 30 By measuring the phosphorylation of Akt upon GA treatment , a B 90 % reduction in p Akt levels was observed , whereas total Akt levels were not signiﬁcantly changed . Cells depleted of ﬂotillin - 2 showed a 40 % reduced phosphorylation of Akt ( Figures 5d and e ) . In contrast to the data obtained with ﬂotillin - 2 , only a slight but not signiﬁcant reduction in the p - Akt levels was observed upon ﬂotillin - 1 depletion . High expression of ﬂotillin - 2 correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer To verify the physiological role of ﬂotillins as regulators of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 , and to determine whether ﬂotillin levels are clinically correlated with ErbB2 expression , we examined how ﬂotillin levels correlate with ErbB2 levels in breast cancer tissues . To this end , we used immunohistochemistry to analyse ﬂotillin and ErbB2 levels in tissues from 194 patients diagnosed with carcinomas of the breast ( stage I / II ) . The samples were scored and a correlation coefﬁcient was calculated as described in the Materials and Methods . The analysis ( Figures 6a – c , Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Table S1 ) showed a correlation of ﬂotillin - 1 and ﬂotillin - 2 levels ( R ¼ 0 . 746 , P o 0 . 001 , n ¼ 130 ) , of ﬂotillin - 1 and ErbB2 levels ( R ¼ 0 . 431 , P o 0 . 001 , n ¼ 140 ) and of ﬂotillin - 2 and ErbB2 levels ( R ¼ 0 . 307 , P o 0 . 001 , n ¼ 133 ) . More - over , our study demonstrate that the expression of ﬂotillin - 2 is correlated with survival time ( log - rank , P ¼ 0 . 0349 ; Figure 6d ) , but that is not the case for ﬂotillin - 1 ( P ¼ 0 . 427 ; Figure 6e ) . Thus , high expression of ﬂotillin - 2 was associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival time , and it emerges as a potential predictor of relapse in breast cancer . DISCUSSION The most important ﬁnding in the present article is that stabilization of ErbB2 at the cell surface is dependent on functional ﬂotillin proteins . This stabilization is mediated by a complex containing ErbB2 , Hsp90 and ﬂotillin proteins . Depletion of or functional interference with one of these components disrupts this complex , and results in destabilization , internalization and degradation of ErbB2 , thereby interfering with ErbB2 signalling . This is reﬂected by reduced phosphorylation of ErbB2 and reduced activation of the ErbB2 effector Akt . We have here demonstrated that depletion of ﬂotillins induced the internalization and degradation of ErbB2 , and depletion of ﬂotillin - 2 resulted in a stronger reduction of ErbB2 levels than seen Figure 4 .

Knockdown of ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 does not affect Hsp90 levels . GAPDH levels were analysed as loading controls . ( c ) Quantiﬁcation of ﬂotillin - 1 / Hsp90 proximity by PLA . The level of ﬂotillin - 1 / Hsp90 proximity signals is reduced by GA , but is also signiﬁcantly reduced by ErbB2 knockdown ( P ¼ 0 . 036 , n ¼ 3 , mean ± s . e . m . ) . ( d ) Quantiﬁcation of ﬂotillin - 2 / Hsp90 proximity by PLA . Knockdown of ErbB2 results in signiﬁcantly reduced level of ﬂotillin - 2 / Hsp90 proximity signal ( P ¼ 0 . 029 , n ¼ 4 , mean ± s . e . m . ) . ( e ) Protein expression levels in ErbB2 - depleted cells . SKBR3 cells were treated with siRNA oligonucleotides targeting ErbB2 and incubated for 3 days , cells were lysed and analysed by SDS – PAGE . ErbB2 levels were signiﬁcantly reduced ( B 70 % reduction compared with control cells ) , but protein levels of ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 and Hsp90 were not inﬂuenced . GAPDH levels were determined as loading controls . Flotillins stabilize ErbB2 at the plasma membrane S Pust et al 3447 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2013 ) 3443 – 3451 after depletion of ﬂotillin - 1 . In agreement with this observation is the ﬁnding that Akt phosphorylation was reduced after knock - down of ﬂotillin - 2 but not after ﬂotillin - 1 depletion , and that only ﬂotillin - 2 can serve as a prognostic marker for breast cancer at early stages . The differences seen with ﬂotillin - 1 and ﬂotillin - 2 may reﬂect the slightly different nature , different membrane - anchoring properties , intracellular localization and functions of ﬂotillin - 1 and - 2 , as described earlier by us and other groups . 22 , 31 , 32 Moreover , a stronger reduction of ErbB2 levels was obtained when GA treatment was combined with depletion of ﬂotillin - 2 . This indicates that ﬂotillin - 2 depletion and GA treatment can have synergistic effects that might be of therapeutical interest . In line with a potential role of ﬂotillins as stabilizers of proteins at the membrane , ﬂotillin - 1 has been reported to stabilize the level of caveolin - 1 in intestinal epithelial cells , 33 and caveolins by themselves are involved in membrane organization . As the ErbB2 / Hsp90 interaction is impaired by ﬂotillin depletion , and also the association between ﬂotillin and Hsp90 is affected upon depletion of ErbB2 , the data suggest that there is a molecular complex containing ErbB2 , Hsp90 and ﬂotillin proteins . However , future studies are required to characterize other proteins in this complex that may participate in the regulation and stabilization of ErbB2 receptors . Inhibition of Hsp90 has been shown to induce rapid ubiquitina - tion of ErbB2 followed by receptor downregulation . 34 , 35 Indeed , in our experiments , GA treatment results in strong receptor ubiquitination ( Supplementary Figure S2e ) . However , no or very little ErbB2 ubiquitination can be observed after ﬂotillin depletion . In contrast to the short - term effect of GA , depletion of ﬂotillins occurs over a period of 3 days . Thus , it seems likely that most of the internalized ErbB2 is already degraded at that time . This is supported by our data showing reduced ErbB2 levels after ﬂotillin depletion and less internalized ErbB2 compared with GA treatment . On the other hand , we cannot exclude the possibility that ﬂotillin depletion leads to ErbB2 internalization by a mechanism independent of ubiquitination . However , further studies are necessary to elucidate this process . Data from two very recent publications indicate that in HeLa cells ﬂotillin - 1 has a functional role in receptor tyrosine kinase signalling , especially in the activation of MAP kinase signalling and the regulation of FGF signalling . 36 , 37 However , in the SKBR3 cells studied here , we found that Akt phosphorylation is reduced upon depletion of ﬂotillin - 2 , but not after ﬂotillin - 1 knockdown . Thus , receptor tyrosine kinases or receptor tyrosine kinase - mediated signalling pathways might be regulated by ﬂotillins in different ways and / or in a cell type - speciﬁc manner . Moreover , it is possible that the different signalling pathways triggered by ErbB2 are regulated by either ﬂotillin - 1 or ﬂotillin - 2 . Nevertheless , the reduced p - ErbB2 and p - Akt levels triggered by ﬂotillin Figure 5 .

Flotillins stabilize ErbB2 at the plasma membrane S Pust et al 3448 Oncogene ( 2013 ) 3443 – 3451 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited knockdown support our hypothesis of a ﬂotillin - mediated stabilization of ErbB2 . ErbB2 is known to be associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer , but also ﬂotillins have been described to be associated with tumorigenesis . 38 , 39 However , this is the ﬁrst study determining the functional role of both ﬂotillin proteins on the regulation of ErbB2 . We demonstrated that the expression of ﬂotillin - 2 is correlated with survival time . Thus , high expression of ﬂotillin - 2 is associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival time , and it emerges as a potential predictor of relapse in breast cancer . Up to 70 % of all breast tumours are oestrogen receptor - positive , and oestrogen receptor expression is an important prognostic factor . Interestingly , it has been reported that ﬂotillin - 2 also interacts with oestrogen receptors , 40 indicating a signiﬁcant impact of ﬂotillin - 2 function on breast cancer development . On the other hand , based on our tissue microarray studies , ﬂotillin - 1 did not emerge as a prognostic marker for relapse in breast cancer , which did not conﬁrm the study of Lin et al . 39 However , in their study , more than 40 % of the analysed breast cancer tissue was stage III / IV ; whereas in our study , only material of early stages ( stage I / II ) was used to get a high prognostic relevance . Therefore , it might be possible that ﬂotillin - 1 affects tumour progression only at later stages . Further studies are needed to get a detailed picture of the function of ﬂotillins in tumour development . In conclusion , this is the ﬁrst demonstration of a positive correlation between ﬂotillin and ErbB2 levels in cultured breast cancer cells as well as in patient material . Moreover , ﬂotillin - 2 expression levels seem to correlate with poor prognosis in breast cancer , indicating that ﬂotillin - 2 might be a prognostic biomarker for breast cancer . As it has been found that ErbB2 - overexpressing tumours are more likely to be resistant to treatment with tamoxifen and standard chemotherapy , an antibody - based ( trastuzumab / Herceptin ) therapy has become the clinical ﬁrst - line treatment in patients with ErbB2 - overexpressing metastatic breast cancer . 6 , 10 However , even in combination with other chemo - therapeutical medications , more than 70 % of patients with ErbB2 - overexpression show no response to the treatment . 41 Thus , by targeting ﬂotillin expression , new strategies in cancer treatment can be developed . MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies and other reagents HEPES , bovine serum albumin , n - octylglucopyranoside and rabbit anti - ﬂotillin - 2 antibody ( F1680 ) were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St Louis , MO , USA ) . For western blot analysis , anti - ﬂotillin - 1 / - 2 antibodies were from BD Bioscience ( St Jose , CA , USA ) , the rabbit anti - ﬂotillin - 1 antibody was a gift from Dr G van der Goot ( EPFL , Lausanne , Switzerland ) , anti - ErbB2 ( 29D8 ) , anti - Akt and anti - p - Akt Ser473 was from Cell Signaling Technologies ( Boston , MA , USA ) , anti - GAPDH ( glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogen - ase , ab9484 ) was from Abcam ( Cambridge , UK ) , anti - p - ErbB2 Tyr1248 ( Ab - 18 ) and anti - ErbB2 ( Ab - 17 ) was purchased from Thermo Scientiﬁc ( Waltham , MA , USA ) and ﬂuorescently labelled secondary antibodies from Li - Cor Biosciences ( Lincoln , NE , USA ) ( IRDyes ) were used for western blot analysis . Anti - ErbB2 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , 9G6 ) , anti - Hsp90 ( Sigma - Aldrich , H - 114 ) , anti - ﬂotillin - 1 ( van der Goot ) and anti - ﬂotillin - 2 ( Sigma - Aldrich , F1680 ) and secondary antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch ( Suffolk , UK ) were used for confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy .

Flotillins stabilize ErbB2 at the plasma membrane S Pust et al 3449 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2013 ) 3443 – 3451 siRNA transfection , cells were seeded out in six - well plates at a density of 2 (cid:3) 10 5 cells / well , 24h before transfection . siRNAs targeting non - over - lapping parts of the mRNA sequence were used for ﬂotillin - 1 and - 2 , as described before . 22 For the depletion of ErbB2 , a pool of four different siRNA oligonucleotides with the sequences 5 0 - UGGAAGAGAUCACAGG UUA - 3 0 , 5 0 - GAGACCCGCUGAACAAUAC - 3 0 , 5 0 - GGAGGAAUGCCGAGUACUG - 3 0 and 5 0 - GCUCAUCGCUCACAACCAA - 3 0 ( Dharmacon , RNAi Technologies , Lafayette , CO , USA ) has been used . To reduce unspeciﬁc off - target effects , the constructs were ordered as ON - TARGETplus oligos from Dharmacon RNAi Technologies , as negative controls non - targeting oligos were used . For siRNA transfection , the cells were seeded out without antibiotics , grown for 24h and transfected by using Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s procedure . After 4h of transfection , the medium was changed to complete growth medium containing serum and antibiotics , and the cells were grown for 3 days before experiments were started . For rescue experiments , siRNA - resistant ﬂotillin - 1 and - 2 ( DNA 2 . 0 , Menlo Park , CA , USA ) were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 ( Invitrogen ) . SKBR3 cells were seeded and transfected and incubated for 2 days with siRNA oligos ( as described above ) and subsequently transfected and incubated for 24 h with 1 m g of siRNA - resistant ﬂotillin - 1 or - 2 or empty pcDNA3 vector by using FuGene6 ( Roche Applied Science , Basel , Switzerland ) , as described elsewhere . 22 Protein extraction and western blot The cells were washed in cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and lysed in lysis buffer containing 0 . 1 M NaCl , 10m M Na 2 HPO 4 , 1m M EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 60m M n - octylglucopyranoside , pH 7 . 4 and supplemented with Complete protease inhibitors and PhosSTOP ( Roche Diagnostics , Basel , Switzerland ) . The lysate was cleared by centrifugation ( 8000r . p . m . , 10min ) and proteins were separated by SDS – PAGE under reducing conditions . After blotting onto a PVDF membrane ( Immobilon - FL , Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) , the membrane was blocked by air drying . Thereafter , the membrane was re - wet in PBS with 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 ( PBS - T ) ( or in Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) with 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 for phospho - speciﬁc antibodies ) and incubated with the primary antibody in 1 % BSA in PBS - T overnight at 4 1 C . After extensive washing in PBS - T ( or TBS - T ) , LI - CORE infrared dye secondary antibodies ( Li - Cor Biosciences ) were applied , and the bands were detected and quantiﬁed using the Odyssey imaging system ( Li - Cor Biosciences ) . Confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy and imaging Cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides targeting ﬂotillin - 1 or ﬂotillin - 2 or non - targeting control oligos and incubated for 3 days . Subsequently , either the cells were ﬁxed for 15min with 4 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 2min with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 / PBS or ﬁxed and permeabilized for 7min with ice - cold methanol , before immunostained with appropriate antibodies . Fluoro - phore - labelled secondary antibodies used for confocal studies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories . The cells were mounted in Mowiol or Prolong Gold containing DAPI for nuclear staining ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen , Paisley , UK ) and examined by a laser - scanning confocal microscope LSM 710 or LSM 780 ( Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) and a PlanApo 63 (cid:3) / 1 . 4 NA oil - immersion objective . Images were prepared and analysed with the LSM Image Browser software ( Carl Zeiss ) or ImageJ software . In situ PLA The in situ PLA ( Olink Bioscience ) was used to detect ﬂotillin / ErbB2 , ﬂotillin / Hsp90 and ErbB2 / Hsp90 associations . The assay is based on oligonucleo - tide - conjugated PLA probes , containing secondary antibodies directed against primary antibodies for either ﬂotillin - 1 / - 2 , ErbB2 or Hsp90 . Annealing of the probes occurs when the target proteins are in close proximity , which then initiates the ampliﬁcation . The amplicons can be detected by ﬂuorescence microscopy in a quantiﬁable manner . For this assay , SKBR3 cells were seeded in six - well plates on coverslips and either transfected with siRNA oligos and / or pretreated with 3 m M GA for 2h , as indicated in the ﬁgure legends . Cells were washed , ﬁxed and permeabi - lized as described in the section above . Antibodies against ErbB2 ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , 9G6 ) , Hsp90 ( 1 : 100 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , H - 114 ) , ﬂotillin - 1 ( 1 : 2000 , van der Goot ) and ﬂotillin - 2 ( 1 : 200 , Sigma - Aldrich , F1680 ) were used as primary antibodies and the assays were performed as described in the manufacturer’s manual . Slides were mounted with Duolink Mounting Medium ( Olink Bioscience ) and samples were observed by ﬂuorescence microscopy with a LSM 780 confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) . The number of dots were calculated by ImageJ software and normalized to control conditions . Immunoprecipitation Cell lysates from non - treated SKBR3 cells were made in RIPA buffer ( 50m M Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150m M NaCl , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % NP40 , 60m M n - octylglucopyranoside ) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitors and PhosSTOP ( Roche Diagnostics ) , and cleared by centrifugation ( 8000r . p . m . , 10min ) . Protein G - sepharose beads ( Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) in PBS were incubated with the desired antibody for 2h before washing with PBS . Beads pre - bound to antibody were mixed with the lysate and incubated at 4 1 C overnight . After extensive washing , associated proteins were eluted by boiling at 95 1 C for 5min , separated by SDS – PAGE , and blotted onto a PVDF membrane ( Immobilon - FL , Millipore ) . The membrane was processed and the bands detected as described for western blot analysis . Immunohistochemistry and scoring of tissue samples The patient material consists of 194 patients diagnosed with carcinomas of the breast ( Stage I / II ) at the Norwegian Radium Hospital in the period 1978 – 1994 . To obtain a material well suited to test potential prognostic markers , the patients either had relapse or cancer - related death within 5 years after prognosis , or disease - free survival for at least 10 years . From each patient , two cylindrical cores from formalin - ﬁxed and parafﬁn - embedded tumour tissue were taken , and all the cores were collected in three tissue microarrays as described elsewhere . 42 The use of the material has been approved by the South East Region Committee for Research Ethics in Norway ( REK 6 . 2008 . 1000 ) . For immunohistochemistry analysis , antibodies were purchased from Sigma ( anti - ﬂotillin - 1 , HPA1392 , 1 : 1500 and anti - ﬂotillin - 2 , HPA 1396 , 1 : 4000 ) and from Novocastra ( anti - c - erbB - 2 , NCL - CB11 , 1 : 700 ) . Sections ( 3 m m ) of the tissue microarrays were stained with an AutostainerLink48 ( DAKO ) with high pH antibody retrieval , peroxidase block , 30min antibody incubation , EnVision FLEX þ mouse linker and HRP / DAB visualization . The membrane in situ expression of the three proteins was scored by a pathologist according to the proportion and intensity categories proposed by Allred et al . 43 Following this system , the intensity was scored as 0 : no staining ; 1 : weak staining ; 2 : intermediate staining ; 3 : strong staining . The proportion was scored as 0 : 0 % tumour cells with membrane staining ; 1 : 0 p 1 / 100 ; 2 : 1 / 100 p 1 / 10 ; 3 : 1 / 10 p 1 / 3 ; 4 : 1 / 3 p 2 / 3 ; 5 : 2 / 3 p 100 % . For the correlation analysis , a total score ( TS ) was calculated by adding the values for proportion and intensity . For the survival analysis , the total scores were further categorized in two different ways : total score ¼ 0 – 6 , low expression ; total score ¼ 7 – 8 , high expression . In the analysis , some cores were excluded owing to loss of the core during processing , too poor quality to be scored , only benign tissue left in the core or lack of correspondence between the score for intensity and proportion ( for example , proportion ¼ 0 and intensity ¼ 2 ) . Statistics Values of three or more experiments were given as mean ± s . e . m . A P - value of 0 . 05 or less was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant and determined by the Student’s t - test or Mann – Whitney Rank Sum test , as indicated in the ﬁgure legends . For all statistical measurements , a minimum of 50 cells per condition and experiments has been analysed . For immunohistochemistry analysis , Pearson correlation coefﬁcients were calculated between the total scores of the three different proteins . We have made Kaplan – Meier - like curves on categorized total scores to illustrate differences between groups , although the study design imply that this will not be proper survival curves for Stage I / II breast cancer patients . The Mantel – Cox log - rank test was used for testing equality of survival distributions . An event was deﬁned as relapse or cancer - related death . The statistical analyses were performed in SPSS 18 . CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare no conﬂict of interest .
