In undifferentiated N2A cells , SOD1 constructs promoted lamellipodial protru - sions to similar extent as the overexpression of Rac1 , and SOD1 - mediated lamellipodia were prevented by coexpression of the N17 dominant - negative form of Rac1 , or shRNA for a downstream effector of Rac1 , the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 ( IRSp53 ) or its binding partner LIN7 . Moreover , no additive effect was measured by coexpression of the SOD1 constructs with Rac1 , IRSp53 or LIN7 . Collectively these data support a role for SOD1 in the regulation of Rac1 - mediated lamellipodia pathway , a property fully retained by the two SOD1 mutants . ARTICLE HISTORY Received 13 March 2018 Accepted 4 June 2018 KEYWORDS Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) ; Insulin receptor substrate of 53 kDa ( IRSp53 ) ; Lamellipodia ; LIN7 ; Rac1 GTPases ; Superoxide dismutase 1 ( SOD1 ) ; SOD1 mutants G93A and G147S Introduction Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is a devastating age - related neurodegenerative disease characterised by a pro - gressive loss of motor neurons of the central nervous system , leading to progressive muscle denervation and paralysis [ 1 ] . No effective therapy is available for ALS , and understanding the disease pathogenesis could help in developing effective treatments . The majority of ALS cases are sporadic while familial forms account only for 10 % of all ALS [ 2 ] . Twenty percent of inherited ALS is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for superoxide dismutase 1 ( SOD1 ) , an ubiquitously expressed enzyme functioning in the clearance of potentially toxic super - oxide radicals . The resulting mutant proteins have addi - tional but still unclear functions that are toxic for motor neurons . A non - cell autonomous mechanism involving contiguous and functionally related glial cells has also been implicated in the disease [ 3 ] . Whereas damage to motor neurons is associated to the onset of ALS , damage to astrocytes and microglia severely accelerates disease progression [ 4 – 6 ] . Toxicity of mutant SOD1 has been associated with overactivation of NADPH oxidase ( NOX2 ) , due to an apparent higher affinity of mutants to the Rac1 member of the Rho GTPase family , compared to the wild - type ( WT ) SOD1 , which in turn would lock NOX2 in its active superoxide - producing form even in oxidising con - ditions when the WT form dissociates from Rac1 [ 7 ] . Rac1 is , however , known to play a major role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton inside lamellipodia , the actin - based membranous projections that usually appear on moving edge of any cell type [ 8 ] and that are fundamental for neurite formation and collateral branches outgrowth [ 9 ] . We therefore analysed whether SOD1 may promote lamellipodial protrusions , and whether this property is retained by ALS - associated mutated SOD1 . The SOD1 mutants used in this study are the well characterised G93A mutant , which is known to retain the dismutase catalytic activity of the WT enzyme [ 10 ] , and the less studied G147S , lacking of the catalytic activity and causing a very rapid clinical course of the disease [ 11 ] . The effects of SOD1 over - expression were investigated in Neuro 2A ( N2A ) cells , a mouse neural crest - derived cell line that exhibit fibro - blast - like morphology when cultured in regular med - ium supplemented with 15 % serum , while differentiate into neuronal - like cells within a few days when cultured in serum - deprived medium [ 12 ] . The effects of SOD1 overexpression on lamellipo - dia formation were quantitatively analysed by phal - loidin immunostaining to visualise the typical F - actin staining inside lamellipodia . The SOD1 - mediated pathway for lamellipodia was investigated CONTACT Grazia Pietrini grazia . pietrini @ unimi . it Department of Medical Biotechnology and Translational Medicine , Università degli Studi di Milano , Via Vanvitelli 32 , 20129 Milano , Italy Supplemental data for this article can be accessed here COMMUNICATIVE & INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY 2018 , VOL . 11 , NO . 3 , e1486652 ( 7 pages ) https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1080 / 19420889 . 2018 . 1486652 © 2018 The Author ( s ) .

In addition , to verify the effect of SOD1 overexpression in neuronal differentiation , the lamellipodia promoting activity of SOD1 constructs was also investigated in N2A cells cultured under serum - free conditions . Results Overexpression of SOD1 mediates Rac1 - dependent lamellipodia extension in neuronal - like N2A cells To test whether SOD1 could induce the formation of membrane protrusions in neuronal cells , we ectopically overexpressed untagged WT human SOD1 or the ALS - linked G93A and G147S mutants in N2A cells . Approximately a 8 fold level of expression over the endo - genous was measured for each transfected SOD1 ( see Figure S1 ) . In addition , as negative and positive controls , the cells were transiently transfected with GFP fused to a plasma membrane localisation signal ( mGFP ) and Rac1 fused to HA , respectively . Cells cultured in undifferen - tiated growth conditions ( 15 % FBS ) for 48 hours after transfection were scored for the presence of lamellipodial protrusions by phalloidin staining of F - actin . In these culture conditions , N2A cells have either a spherical or fibroblast - like morphology , and extend lamellipodia and filopodia in order to sense and sample the surrounding environment . Localisation of SOD1 as well as Rac1 in F - actin enriched lamellipodia was clearly revealed by indirect double immunofluorescence staining with the specific antibodies ( Figure 1 ( A ) ) . We next compared the lamellipodia - inducing capa - city of SOD1 with that of Rac1 , and analysed the effect of their cotransfection ( Figure 1 ( B ) ) . Approximately a three - fold increase in the percentage of lamellipodia - bearing cells was found in Rac1 - transfected cells ( ~ 52 % ) compared to mGFP transfected cells ( ~ 17 % ) . The overexpression of SOD1 , either WT or mutants , promoted a similar increase in lamellipodia than Rac1 ( ~ 47 % ) . The same effect measured in cells expressing Rac1 alone was obtained in cells coexpressing Rac1 with each of the SOD1 constructs ( ~ 52 % ) , suggesting that SOD1 and Rac1 are in the same pathway . In order to verify this possibility , Rac1 was inhibited by expression of a dominant negative mutant , the HA - tagged Rac1 - N17 ( Figure 1 ( B ) ) . As expected , inhibition of Rac1 activity decreased the number of cells with lamellipodia under 10 % in control mGFP - cells , and , most importantly , the percentage of lamellipodia - bearing cells remained at control levels also in SOD1 - cotrans - fected cells ( ~ 13 , 5 % ) , thus suggesting that SOD1 is unable to stimulate lamellipodia when Rac1 activity is inhibited . In line with data in literature indicating a main role for Rac1 activation in the formation and function of lamellipodia rather than filopodia , we did not detect any increase in filopodia in cells expressing SOD1 and / or Rac1 ( data not shown ) . The IRSp53 - LIN7 complex is a downstream effector of SOD1 - mediated extension of lamellipodia We next tested SOD1 involvement in Rac1 – mediated pathway for lamellipodia formation by altering the expression of a downstream effector of Rac1 , the insulin receptor substrate protein of 53 KDa ( IRSp53 , also named BAIAP2 ) , which acts as a link between Rac1 and WAVE - ARP 2 / 3 complexes in signalling lamellipodia forma - tion [ 8 , 13 ] . The IRSp53 protein contains multiple domains for protein – protein interactions , including a PDZ domain - binding motif at its C - terminus for interaction with the scaffold protein LIN7 ( also named MALS / Velis ) , and LIN7 association is required to positively regulate IRSp53 activity at specific membrane sites in epithelial and neuronal cells [ 14 – 17 ] . We therefore tested whether IRSp53 and LIN7 play a role in SOD1 - dependent for - mation of lamellipodia by analysing the percentage of lamellipodia - bearing cells in SOD1 overexpressing N2A cells downregulated for / coexpressing IRSp53 or LIN7 ( Figure 1 ( C – D ) ) . SOD1 - mediated increase in lamellipodia was greatly prevented in N2A cells downregulated for IRSp53 or LIN7C , the LIN7 form mainly expressed by these cells [ 16 ] . In line with a role for the IRSp53 - LIN7 complex in lamellipodia formation , the percentage of SOD1 - expressing cells with lamellipodia ( ~ 45 % ) dropped to ~ 21 % and ~ 17 % in cells downregulated for IRSp53 or LIN7 , respectively . Moreover , the overexpression of IRSp53 or LIN7 promoted a > two - fold increase in the percentage of cells with lamellipodia ( from 17 % to ~ 40 % ) , and no further increase was observed in cells co - expressing IRSp53 or LIN7 with any of the SOD1 con - structs ( Figure 1 ( D ) ) . Once again we did not observe a different behaviour among SOD1 WT and the mutants , thus indicating that these mutants retain their function in promoting lamellipodia . e1486652 - 2 I .

The quantitative analysis indicated significant higher lamellipodia - inducing activity in N2A cells transfected with SOD1 , either WT or mutants , compared to control mGFP transfected cells : upon serum deprivation for 24 or 48 hrs , the percentage of cells with lamellipodia dropped to under 10 % in mGFP transfected cells , while it remained high ( ~ 40 % ) in SOD1 - transfected cells . Moreover , in these cells , lamellipodia occupied one third of their entire perimeter ( Figure 2 ( A ) ) . N2A cells expressing mGFP showed a morphology typical of differentiated neuronal cells ( Figure 2 ( B ) ) , characterised by few short and one longer neurite emer - ging from the cell body , with occasional lamellipodia restricted to their extremity ( growth cone ) . This cell morphology was significantly altered in SOD1 trans - fected cells : processes of similar length were emerging from the cell body and lamellipodia were not restricted to their growth cones , but rather unusually found all along neurite shafts . These alterations were virtually never observed in mGFP expressing cells , while they were clearly detected also in cells overexpressing all SOD1 constructs . The altered morphology observed in these cells suggest that overstimulation of lamellipodial path - ways might be detrimental to neuronal differentiation . Discussion This study is based on data in literature reporting that wild type SOD1 and some ALS - mutated SOD1 forms bind and stabilise the Rho GTPases Rac1 [ 7 ] . In glial cells , the authors identified NOX2 as a target of Rac1 activity promoted by SOD1 . However , Rac1 activity is mainly involved in the organisation of actin - based lamellipodial protrusions in all the cell types , with pivotal roles in neurons , where these structures are required for axon extension and guidance , formation of axon branches and synaptic structures [ 9 ] . We therefore hypothesised that overexpression of SOD1 and ALS - associated mutated SOD1 would promote lamellipo - dial protrusions in neuronal cells . This hypothesis was tested in N2A cells cultured under undifferentiated and differentiated conditions , and in both cell culture condi - tions we found that the expression of SOD1 promoted a three - fold increase in lamellipodia , identified by their typi - cal morphology of sheet - like membrane protrusions enriched in F - actin . The involvement of Rac1 in the SOD1 mediated pathway for lamellipodia is inferred by results obtained in undifferentiated N2A cells . In these cells we found that : i ) overexpressed SOD1 stimulated lamelli - podia to similar extent than overexpressed Rac1 ; ii ) SOD1 - mediated lamellipodia were prevented by inhibition of Rac1 pathways ( by coexpression of the dominant negative Rac1 N17 or in cells downregulated for a downstream effector of Rac1 , the IRSp53 - LIN7 complex ) ; ( iii ) no further increase in lamellipodia was observed in SOD1 cells coexpressing Rac1 , IRSp53 or LIN7 . Collectively these data support the possibility that the increase in lamellipodia observed in the surface of cells overexpressing SOD1 is a consequence of SOD1 activation of Rac1 - mediated pathway for lamellipodial extension . Harraz and colleagues [ 7 ] have previously shown that wild type SOD1 and mutants L8Q and G10V ( both lacking their catalytic activity ) bind and activate Rac1 , our data suggest that this also occurs for the G93A and G147S mutants . In line with the possi - bility that also these SOD1 mutants bind and activate Rac1 , the similar increase in lamellipodia found in cells overexpressing G93A and G147S is not surprising . However , reduced rather than increased levels of acti - vated Rac1 ( Rac1GTP ) were found in cell lysates of SH - SY5Y neuroblastoma cells overexpressing SOD1 mutants G93A and H80R [ 18 ] . The decrease in acti - vated Rac1 may be due to differences in neuronal cell type , alternatively , the lamellipodia measurement used in our study may better reflect Rac1 activity on the cell surface than total Rac1GTP measured by pull down assays . The overactivation of lamellipodial pathways was observed either by overexpression of WT or mutated forms of SOD1 and was associated to morphological defects during neuronal differentiation in N2A cells , suggesting a novel mechanism of SOD1 - mediated neu - rotoxicity . Regulatory mechanisms normally preventing toxicity of WT SOD1 at basal expression levels might be unable to operate in conditions of overexpression . In line with this possibility , neuronal tissue abnormalities have been reported in WT SOD1 transgenic mice [ 19 ] , and abnormally high levels of SOD1 transcripts were reported in spinal cord , brain stem and lymphocytes of sporadic ALS patients [ 20 ] , although it remains to be investigated whether these conditions are associated to overstimulation of Rac1 - mediated pathway for lamellipodia . Materials and methods Constructs The constructs GFP - IRSp53 , GFP - LIN7A and shRNA LIN7C have been previously described [ 15 , 16 ] ; shRNA IRSp53 was purchased from Sigma Aldrich . A 50 % reduction of LIN7 was achieved by shRNA LIN7C [ 16 ] , while a slightly lower downregulation of IRSp53 was detected by Western blot in cells trans - fected with shRNA IRSp53 ( Figure S2 ) . cDNAs for COMMUNICATIVE & INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY e1486652 - 5 human SOD1 and SOD1G93A were a kind gift of Dr . C . Bendotti [ 21 ] . SOD1 G147S was generated by means of Quickchange Site - directed Mutagenesis ( Stratagene , CA ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using the hSOD1 cDNA as the template . The full - length cDNA insert was excised and recloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 ( Invitrogen , Paisley , UK ) . The absence of unwanted substitution was checked by sequencing . The GFP construct fused to a membrane localisation sequence ( mGFP ) was a kind gift from Dr N . Borgese [ 22 ] . pCDNA3 - Rac1 - HA and pCDNA3 - Rac1N17 were a kind gift of Dr . G . Scita . Cell culture and transfection Murine neuroblastoma Neuro2A ( N2A ) cells [ 23 ] were grown in DMEM with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 1 mM glutamine and antibiotics . The cell lines were cultured in a 37°C incubator containing 5 % CO 2 . Transfections : cDNAs and shRNAs were transiently transfected in N2A cells by using PEI ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , following the manufacturer ’ s protocol . To maintain the same dosage of transfected SOD1 in all the experiments , SOD1 cDNA has been always cotrans - fected with control empty vectors or with the cDNA of interest . Twenty - four hours after transfection cells were cultured for additional 24 or 48 hours in media con - taining 15 % FBS ( undifferentiated N2A ) , or in regular media depleted of serum ( - FBS ) for 24 or 48 h ( differ - entiated cells ) before paraformaldehyde fixation . Antibodies The polyclonal rabbit anti - LIN7 antiserum was raised against the histidine - LIN7A fusion protein [ 15 ] ; the polyclonal rabbit anti - IRSp53 was a kind gift from Dr E . Kim ( Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology ) [ 24 ] . Commercial primary antibodies : sheep polyclonal against human SOD1 ( Calbiochem , Darmstadt , Germany ) and mouse monoclonal anti - HA antibody ( Invitrogen , Paisley , UK ) . Immunofluorescence After being grown and transfected as described , the cells were fixed for 20 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) and permeabilised with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 . Immunostaining with primary antibodies was followed by incubation with Fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) / CY5 anti - rabbit / mouse antibo - dies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . Texas - red Phalloidin was used to stain F - actin ( Molecular Probes ) . Wide - field microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axioplan inverted phase - contrast microscope ( 60x objective ) connected with an AxioCam HRm CCD camera . Image and statistical analysis For quantification of the percentage of cells – bearing lamellipodia : The percentage was manually quantified using a Zeiss Axioplan inverted phase - contrast micro - scope ( 60× objective ) connected with an AxioCam HRm CCD camera . Lamellipodia were defined as ruffled plasma membrane processes containing brush - like actin filaments . This definition in no way attributes any functional value to these structures and is purely a reflection of morphological similarity to lamellipodia . For each condition and transfectant , data are the mean ± s . e . m . of 150 cells examined in randomly chosen fields from 3 independent experiments . For quantification of the percentage of cell perimeter occupied by lamellipodia , wide - field images of trans - fected N2A cells were analysed with ImageJ as follows : the full perimeter of each cell was measured with the “ segmented line ” tool . Lamellipodia of the same cells ( identified by both the typical ruffled appearance of the plasma membrane and the brush - like appearance of F - actin ) were then outlined and measured with the same tool . For each condition and transfectant , data are the mean ± s . e . m . of 60 cells from 3 independent experiments . All quantitative data are presented as means ± s . e . m . ; multiple comparisons among groups were carried out with Student ’ s t - test using Prism software ( GraphPad PrismTM software ) .
