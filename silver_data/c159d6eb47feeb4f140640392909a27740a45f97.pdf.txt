DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1145 / 3334480 . 3382994 Abstract Contemporary WYSIWYG ( what - you - see - is - what - you - get ) design software utilizes digital Artboards which are finite graphics frames that sit atop a scrollable zooming canvas ; where many graphics frames can be arbitrarily arranged , scaled and duplicated to explore and juxtapose design ideas . Despite creative practitioners increasingly writing code to explore design spaces , programming environments for Creative Coding regularly only display one graphics frame per program . This hinders the non - linear nature of the creative process where seeing a trail of process work can spark new ideas . We propose bridging this gap and introduce Stamper , an Artboard - Oriented authoring environment for the popular creative coding library p5 . js .

Design By Numbers ; 1999 Artboards 1 is employed to make comparisons , draw conclusions and tell stories ( Figure 4 ) . Using Artboards affords the exploration of ideas in a light and fast way because it’s easy to try small modifications while still having the prior work in the periphery . Another benefit is that once one has a few boards , they can be strung together into a storyboard [ 1 ] . Moreover , as boards start piling up , the juxtapositions between them becomes a source of ideas itself . Figure 2 . Processing Development Environment ; 2003 Figure 3 . p5 . js Web Editor in Safari ; 2019 Figure 4 . Design practice frequently involves the arrangement of Artboards to compare , juxtapose , and develop ideas Early design tools for computers utilized the metaphors of ‘Pages’ and ‘Layers [ 2 ] , but Artboard - Oriented tools ( Figure 5 ) have become increasingly dominant over the last decade . 1 Sometimes known as ‘Thumbnail Sketches’ or ‘Panels’ Figure 5 . Bohemian Coding’s Sketch is an example of Artboard - Oriented design software . ( A ) Artboard ( B ) scrollable zooming canvas ( C ) object - list for the Artboard labeled A As computing has become pervasive , “sketching with code” has become a practice among artists and designers [ 3 ] , however , the programming environments being used in these practices , like Processing , do not have Artboards . Instead , they employ the 3 - Part IDE Archetype of ‘instructions - box’ , ‘console’ and a singular ‘graphics canvas’ ( Figures 1 - 3 ) . Though significant research has been conducted into Visual Programming Languages ( VPLs ) [ 4 ] much of that effort has been focused on developing novel languages for the ‘instructions - box’ portion of the UI [ 5 ] . There is an opportunity for an alternative direction which tackles the 3 - part UI archetype in programming environments while relying on existing systems for entering instructions . Our hypothesis is that for Creative Coding , many arbitrarily rearrangeable canvases is better than one . LBW207 , Page 2 CHI 2020 Late - Breaking Work CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA Figure 6 . ‘Illustrator Style’ Artboards act as ‘cropping - rectangles’ on top of the canvas but do not affect the organization of objects in the layer - list . Figure 7 . ‘Sketch Style’ Artboards are represented as containers in the layer - list , creating a ‘separation of concerns’ ; nesting objects by their position on the canvas . Background Our investigation is connected to three largely distinct software histories : ‘Arts - Engineering Toolkits’ 1999 , John Maeda created Design By Numbers ( DBN ) [ 8 ] which subsequently morphed into Processing [ 9 ] and laid the foundation for the contemporary “Creative Coding” movement [ 10 ] . Over the successive two decades , Processing [ 11 ] and later p5 . js accumulated functionality and were nurtured with educational content [ 12 ] . However , in terms of UI , none of DBN’s descendants ( e . g . Processing Development Environment [ 13 ] , p5 . js Desktop Editor [ 14 ] , p5 . js Web Editor [ 15 ] ) have advanced meaningfully beyond it . Zooming UIs and Artboard - Oriented tools Research into zooming user interfaces largely began at the MIT Architecture Machine Group in the late 1970s with ‘Dataland’ [ 18 ] and was later advanced throughout the 1990s [ 19 ] [ 20 ] . As early as 1994 , Aldus Freehand 4 had support for multiple arbitrarily arranged pages to be positioned on a scrollable zoomable ‘Pasteboard’ surface [ 16 ] . In 2008 , Adobe Illustrator CS4 added support for multiple Artboards within a single document on a scrollable zoomable canvas [ 21 ] . In 2009 , Prezi introduced a radical super - zoom canvas metaphor [ 22 ] . A year later , Sketch was released with an ‘infinite canvas’ and pages ; ‘Illustrator - style’ ( Figure 6 ) Artboards were added with version 2 . 0 in 2012 . Sketch 3 , released in 2014 , introduced ‘Sketch Style’ ( Figure 7 ) Artboards — this was a major ergonomic change which shifted the metaphor from one global canvas with selections to many independent canvases , allowing practitioners to manage complex projects with many artboards . By 2015 , Sketch was the most popular tool for ‘Wireframing’ and ‘Interface Design’ among software designers [ 24 ] . Adobe rushed to add Artboards to Photoshop [ 23 ] and introduce new Artboard - Oriented tools [ 25 ] . In 2016 , V1 of Figma launched with ‘Sketch Style’ Artboards from the get - go . Structure Editors Though there are many varieties , and a review of them is beyond the scope of this paper , all ‘structured editing’ involves moving away from plain - text programming in some way . Two common types of structure editors are those that structure the individual instruction - input by replacing character - editing with block - editing [ 28 ] and those that structure function - level organization by bucketing functions into defined visual regions [ 26 ] [ 29 ] . Because these histories have yet to converge , we see an opportunity to do so by embedding the Arts - Engineering Toolkit p5 . js within a new kind of editor that is modeled after the interaction paradigms exhibited in Artboard - Oriented WYSIWYG design software . Designing for Creativity The creative process is often non - linear . In contrast to software professionals , who are trained to start coding with a preconceived idea of the correct answer [ 35 ] , creative practitioners tend to explore many different options [ 17 ] , draw inspiration from loosely connected ideas [ 6 ] , and think through making . In outlining design principles for creative tools , Resnick et al . highlight the importance of supporting exploration . Furthermore , they discuss creating tools which , like ‘paper and pencil’ , facilitate creative reflection , and the two - dimensional spatial positioning essential for LBW207 , Page 3 CHI 2020 Late - Breaking Work CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA Figure 10 .

Both the overall Stamp and Graphics Frame can be resized . gathering thoughts [ 33 ] . Prior research has explored the need to apply these ideas to software design [ 31 ] [ 32 ] and to programming tools [ 36 ] , however we are the first to argue that the Artboard - Oriented paradigm of WYSIWYG design software be adapted to programming environments as a means of doing so . Interface Stamper ( prototype at p5stamper . com ) is a programming environment that uses p5 . js and Artboard - like objects called ‘Stamps’ ( Figure 8 ) which sit atop a scrollable zooming canvas . LBW207 , Page 4 CHI 2020 Late - Breaking Work CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA How p5 . js Works p5 . js programs have two essential functions : setup ( ) and draw ( ) “The setup ( ) function is called once when the program starts . It ' s used to define initial environment properties such as screen size and background color” [ 37 ] Draw ( ) is “called directly after setup ( ) ” and “continuously executes the lines of code contained inside its block until the program is stopped” [ 38 ] Figure 11 . Similarly to in other design software , Stamper allows spatial - object duplication [ 34 ] In a typical p5 . js editor , the author only has a single graphics frame available to them while editing any one program 2 . If a p5 . js program only uses the draw ( ) function , there is a clear 1 : 1 mapping 3 between it and the visual output . However , once a user begins to use abstractions like helper functions , an invisible world – never witnessed directly – begins to emerge . In Stamper , we uncloak this invisible world by giving every function its own graphics frame . This design has multiple advantages : • Since each function has an isolated ‘debug - view’ , the surface area through which the author can perceive their system is larger • Modular programming is encouraged , enabling the author to freely create , perceive , and utilize abstractions while retaining visibility In addition to visualizing all functions by automatically creating graphics frame contents ( Figure 9 ) , Stamper can visually render dependencies between Stamps on the canvas , which appear to the author as lines with arrowheads . There are three main types of lines : 1 . R EFERENCE L INES indicate Variable usage and Function calls ( e . g . Figure 10 : 5 ) 2 . A RCHITECTURE L INES indicate p5 . js language behaviour ( i . e . the line from preload ( ) to Figure 10 : A shows preload ( ) will be bundled into Stamp A’s Graphics Frame , similarly to in Figure 9 ) 3 . F ILE L INES visualize local assets being loaded into program variables ( e . g . the line leaving the Stamp at Figure 10 : E ) 2 Programs are referred to as ‘Sketches’ in Processing and p5 . js 3 DBN reified this 1 : 1 mapping by eschewing functions entirely . All visual output was directly beside the code which specified it . To achieve our goal of rapid alternative creation ( i . e . easy copying [ 39 ] ) we implemented the Click + Option ( ⌥ ) Drag interaction technique ( Figure 11 ) which is widely used in WYSIWYG design software . All this said , Stamper is only an editor , projects created within it can be used with any other p5 . js editor and vice versa . When the desktop Stamper App is used , we add a meta . stamper file to the project folder to persist Stamp structure ( i . e . size and position on canvas ) across sessions . Stamper’s interface was designed with the goal of making Creative Coding more accessible to those with ‘concrete / bricolage’ cognitive styles [ 7 ] which are common in the creative industries [ 33 ] . Moreover , these benefits are available without breaking compatibility with the existing p5 . js library and its ecosystem ; a typical limitation faced by new environments with similar goals . Preliminary Evaluation To gauge initial reactions to Stamper , we conducted a convenience - sample ( n = 5 ) of unstructured interviews with recent graduates of Carnegie - Mellon who are now working in the fields of design and computing , all of whom “code to sketch” as part of their jobs . Everyone interviewed was familiar with and used Artboard - Oriented design software on a daily basis — P4 , a former design grad student , described them as “the primary way [ he ] keeps track of revisions and iterations [ …forming a ] continuous chronological palette” of his practice . P1 , a former design and HCI undergrad , said about version control software like Git : “Traditional version control isn’t reflective of my creative workflow . LBW207 , Page 5 CHI 2020 Late - Breaking Work CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA [ Stamper ] is a great alternative because it allows me to see and interact with multiple versions at the same time” . This sentiment was echoed by P2 ( same majors ) who spoke about how they could see themselves using Stamper when trying to compare many visual treatments . P3 , a former design student who now works as creative technologist , said about his day - to - day work “The issue of working through the keyhole [ is ] a problem all the time , I’m always looking at the console” . Along the same vein , P5 , a former engineering and art student , said of Stamper that it “allows [ her ] to see the visuals that are generated by specific bits of code instead of everything at the same time” . P2 expected Stamper to become tedious if they called one function in many places and then later had to change it because “I would have to go find all those other places” . 4 Another problem that was uniformly highlighted was performance , with every interviewee emphasizing that Stamper was irritatingly slow . Discussion and Future Work From the initial feedback we received , creative coders introduced to Stamper were excited by its promise but upset with its present performance — a surmountable issue . Separately , our internal testing of Stamper has begun to unearth a schism between the p5 . js language and certain ways of programming which are afforded by Stamper . For example : adding a slider to the DOM within setup ( ) to parameterize an aspect of draw ( ) is common in p5 . js code , but in Stamper means all function stamps will display that slider in their 4 Note that our interviews were conducted before we added dependency visualizing lines , which may alleviate P2’s concern . otherwise unique graphics frames , a less than optimal experience at times . To us , this begs a fork in the road of future work : ( A ) continue with Stamper as an editor for p5 . js programs , or ( B ) create a new language designed for use in an Artboard - Oriented Programming Environment — both worthy directions of inquiry . In either case , we think structuring more software patterns ( e . g . Classes ) into new Stamp types and finding ways of visualizing helper functions that don’t draw anything are interesting abstract issues of note . We would also like to adapt other features common in Artboard - Oriented design software to Stamper ; such as grouping , automatic object layout , and editing multiple objects at the same . We believe Artboards , and design software generally , are fertile ground for HCI researchers to harvest new approaches to designing programming environments . Acknowledgements We never would have arrived at these ideas if not for the multi - disciplinary educations we received at Carnegie Mellon and for the extra - intuitional instruction and advisement we received from across campus . We are especially indebted to Golan Levin , whose STUDIO for Creative Inquiry was the cradle which sparked and nurtured this endeavor , to Brad A . Myers for reference advice , and to the School of Design’s Peter Scupelli and Austin S . Lee ( former faculty ) — whose fateful course inspired deeply . Cameron is especially thankful to Hugh Dubberly for sewing the phrase ‘Authoring Environment’ into his mind in 2017 , to Paul Pangaro whose conversations forced progress , and to Max Krieger for knocking over the first domino .
