Statistical Analyses For each array , the raw data comprise the logarithm of median feature pixel intensity at wavelengths 635 nm ( red ) and 532 nm ( green ) . No background is subtracted . In the following description , log ratio refers to the differential expression between leaves and flowers . It is either log2 ( red / green ) or log2 ( green / red ) according to the experiment design . Normalization : An array - by - array normalization is performed to remove systematic biases . First , we exclude spots that are considered badly formed features . Then we performe a global intensity - dependent normalization using the loess procedure ( see Yang et al . , 2002 ) to correct the dye bias . Finally , for each block , the log - ratio median calculated over the values for the entire block is subtracted from each individual log - ratio value to correct print tip effects on each metablock . Raw Data Normalized Data Differential expression analysis : To determine differentially expressed genes , we performe a paired t test on the log ratios . The number of observations per spot varies between two and four and is inadequate for calculating a gene - specific variance . For this reason , we assume that the variance of the log - ratios is the same for all genes , and we exclude 256 spots displaying extremes of variance ( too small or too large ) . The raw P values are adjusted by the Bonferroni method , which controls the Family Wise Error Rate ( FWER ) ( Chupeau et al . , 1974 ) .
