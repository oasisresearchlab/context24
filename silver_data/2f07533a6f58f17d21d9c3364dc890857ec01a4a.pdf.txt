The Arp2 / 3 complex is the best candidate to generate Tokyo 108 Japan new barbed ends by stimulating nucleation ( Bi and Zig - mond , 1999 ; Machesky and Gould , 1999 ) .

Our demonstration that the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for Cdc42 - induced actin assembly in Xenopus extracts Introduction suggests that the Cdc42 signaling pathway might be such a cellular mechanism ( Ma et al . , 1998b ) .

In order to test the requirement for N - WASP in this purified components . This N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 interaction is also required for Cdc42 - stimulated actin assembly in system , we raised a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against a full - length , recombinant rat N - WASP protein that is Xenopus egg extracts .

( E ) Summary of the G - actin binding , Arp2 / 3 binding , and Arp2 / 3 activation properties of full - length N - WASP and the fragments shown in ( A ) . Binding of full - length N - WASP to Arp2 / 3 was determined by coimmunoprecipitation rather than GST pull down . Binding of GST - V and GST - VCA was determined by both methods . ( Figure 2C ) , suggesting a biochemical mechanism for its the p21ARC subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) . phenotypes in tissue culture cells as well as in Xenopus extracts ( Figure 1E ) . Unexpectedly , the H208D mutant , We expressed and purified GST fusion proteins con - taining various portions of this VCA region ( diagrammed which has only one point mutation in the GBD domain , does not accelerate actin assembly ( data not shown ) , in Figure 3A ) and tested their abilities to interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex in a GST pull - down assay . The complex suggesting that this mutation leads to defects in func - tions other than just Cdc42 binding . bound to GST - CA and GST - VCA but not to GST , GST - V , and GST - VC ( Figure 3B ) . As a control , the fragments were tested for binding to G - actin and , as expected , the The C Terminus of N - WASP Strongly Accelerates Arp2 / 3 - Mediated Actin Assembly presence of the V domain perfectly correlated with this property ( Figure 3B ) . We conclude that the C - terminal To define the region of N - WASP required for activity , we concentrated on a C - terminal region of N - WASP 55 amino acids of N - WASP ( 450 – 505 ) are necessary and sufficient to bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex and that the ( amino acids 392 – 505 ) , which contains a G - actin - bind - ing V domain , a cofilin homology sequence ( C ) , and an ability to bind G - actin through the V domain is not re - quired . We were unable to detect any interaction be - acidic segment ( A ) ( Figures 1A and 3A ) . The VCA region is thought to mediate interactions of N - WASP with tween full - length N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 by coimmuno - precipitation under conditions where the binding of downstream effectors because mutations in this region abrogate its ability to induce actin rearrangements upon GST - VCA to Arp2 / 3 is readily detectable ( data not shown ) . injection into cells andoften function as dominant - nega - tive mutations ( Miki et al . , 1998a ) . In addition , a homolo - Since the C - terminal region of N - WASP could bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin , we wanted to determine gous region from other WASP family proteins ( Scar1 / WAVE and WASP ) was recently found to interact with whether it could confer the activity of the full - length N - WASP Interaction with the Arp2 / 3 Complex 225 Figure 4 . The GST - CA Fragment Can Inhibit the Interaction between N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 Complex ( A ) Stimulation of actin polymerization ( 2 . 5 (cid:109) M actin and 60 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ) by N - WASP ( 200 nM ) is inhibited by GST - CA but not GST - V . ( B ) Stimulation of actin polymerization ( 2 . 5 (cid:109) M actin and 60 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ) by GST - VCA ( 1 nM ) is inhibited by GST - CA in a dose - dependent manner . ( C ) Cdc42 - stimulated actin polymerization in Xenopus HSS is inhibited by GST - CA , but not GST - V or GST - VC ( 200 nM each ) . ( D ) Dose - dependent inhibition of Cdc42 - stimulated actin polymerization in Xenopus HSS by GST - CA as compared using the initial rate and maximal level of F - actin assembly . The control depicts assembly in the absence of any GST - CA . protein to accelerate actin polymerization . When the N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 interaction ( Figure 3E ) . When this model was tested using purified components , GST - CA purified fragments were mixed with pure Arp2 / 3 com - plex , only the GST - VCA fusion protein accelerated as - ( but not GST - V , GST - VC , or GST ) inhibits the ability of both full - length N - WASP and the GST - VCA fragment to semblykinetics , shorteningthelagphaseandincreasing the elongation rate by 30 - fold ( Figure 3C ) . Figure 3D stimulate actin polymerization in the presence of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . clearly shows that the GST - VCA fragment shortens the lag phase to polymerization in a dose - dependent man - The efficacy of the GST - CA fragment as a dominant negative was tested in Xenopus HSS for its effects on ner , suggesting that it can lower the kinetic barrier to nucleation . These effects are dependent on the pres - Cdc42 - induced actin assembly . When used in extracts at concentrations roughly equivalent to the estimated ence of the Arp2 / 3 complex and can be inhibited by cytochalasin D ( data not shown ) . The GST - V , GST - VC , endogenousArp2 / 3concentration ( (cid:122) 100 – 300nM ) , GST - CA specifically inhibited Cdc42 - induced actin assembly and GST - CA fragments have no effect , even when used at 4 - fold higher concentrations ( Figure 3C ) . The GST - ( Figures 4C and 4D ) . This result strongly suggests that the kind of interaction between N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 VCA fragment is both much more potent and effective in stimulating actin polymerization when compared to complex that we have observed using purified compo - nents in vitro is also required for Cdc42 - induced actin the full - length N - WASP , a point we will return to later . Thus , the requirements for binding to the Arp2 / 3 com - polymerization in a more complete and physiological system . plex are different from the requirements for activation , as summarized in Figure 3E .

However , when the Arp2 / 3 complex but cannot activate it suggests that it can be used as a competitive inhibitor to block the added to Xenopus HSS at concentrations ( 400 nM ) as Cell226 Figure 5 . Full - Length N - WASP and the GST - VCA Fragment Activate Actin Polymerization with Different Potencies ( A ) Comparion of spontaneous ( Cdc42 - independent ) actin polymerization in Xenopus HSS treated with the indicated concentrations of full - length N - WASP , GST - CA , or GST - VCA . ( B ) Actin polymerization ( 2 . 5 (cid:109) M actin and 60 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ) stimulated by full - length N - WASP ( 200 nM ) or GST - VCA ( 10 nM ) . ( C ) Dose – response curves showing the variation in the maximum rate of filament elongation as a function of increasing concentrations of either GST - VCA or full - length N - WASP in the presence of 60 nM Arp2 / 3 complex . The elongation rate was calculated from the linear phase of polymerization curves of the type shown in ( B ) . The main graph depicts the concentrations ( abscissa ) on a log scale , whereas the inset depicts them on a linear scale . At higher concentrations of GST - VCA , the elongation rate saturates and is no longer a good indicator of activity . Instead , the shortening of the lag phase becomes more dramatic ( Figure 3D ) . high as 8 - fold above the estimated endogenous N - WASP difference between the full - length protein and the GST - VCA fragment in their ability to stimulate actin polymer - concentration ( 50 nM ) , full - length N - WASP did not stim - ulate spontaneous actin assembly in the absence of ization in the presence of the Arp2 / 3 complex . When full - length N - WASP was directly compared to the GST - activated Cdc42 ( Figure 5A ) . To test whether this differ - ence in the behavior of N - WASP in the purified system VCA fragment , a large difference in activity was observed : 10 nM GST - VCA stimulates polymerization in vitro far compared to the extract is due to inhibitory factors that interact with its N terminus , we added the GST - VCA more effectively than 200 nM N - WASP ( Figure 5B ) . To obtain a more quantitative measure of the activity fragment to Xenopus HSS . We reasoned that GST - VCA would bypass the Cdc42 requirement and act in a domi - difference between full - length N - WASP and the GST - VCA fragment , we generated dose – response curves for nant active fashion in the extract . Indeed , when GST - VCA was added to the HSS ( in the absence of any acti - both proteins , using elongation rates as an indicator of activation ( Figure 5C ) . The concentration required for vated Cdc42 ) even at very low concentrations , actin polymerization was dramatically stimulated : the effect half maximal activation is (cid:122) 250 nM for the full - length protein and (cid:122) 2 nM for GST - VCA ( Figure 5C ) . Based on of 1 nM GST - VCA was comparable to that of 800 nM N - WASP ( Figure 5A ) . This observation suggests that elongation rates , the C - terminal VCA domain is at least 100 times more potent than full - length N - WASP . This N - WASP is regulated in extracts , a property that is con - ferred by the N terminus of the molecule . potency difference is also demonstrated by the (cid:122) 20 - fold higher molar ratio of GST - CA needed to inhibit GST - How might the activity of N - WASP be regulated ? It hasbeen proposedthatN - WASPis intrinsicallyinhibited VCA compared to the full - length protein ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . The efficacy of GST - VCA at inducing actin polymer - and is activated when the VCA region is unmasked , perhaps by the binding of upstream regulators to the N ization is also about 5 - fold higher than that of N - WASP ( Figure 5C ) . The difference in activity between GST - VCA terminus ( Miki et al . , 1998a ) . This model predicts a large N - WASP Interaction with the Arp2 / 3 Complex 227 Figure 6 . Cdc42 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 Coordinately Activate Full - Length N - WASP In Vitro ( A ) The effect of GTP (cid:103) S - Cdc42 ( 500 nM ) , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing vesicles ( 100 (cid:109) M , PC : PI : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , 48 : 48 : 4 ) , or both on actin polymerization ( 2 . 5 (cid:109) M actin and 60 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ) stimulated by N - WASP ( 200 nM ) . The solid line shows stimulation of actin polymerization under the same conditions by GST - VCA ( 200 nM ) alone . ( B ) Dose – response curves showing the maximum elongation rate of actin polymerization ( 2 . 5 (cid:109) M actin and 60 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ) as a function of the following molecules added : GST - VCA , full - length N - WASP , and full - length N - WASP stimulated with GTP (cid:103) S - Cdc42 ( 50 nM ) and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing vesicles ( 100 (cid:109) M , PC : PI : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , 48 : 48 : 4 ) . Note that the curve of N - WASP activated by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and GTP (cid:103) S - Cdc42 starts to taper off between 8 and 80 nM because the Cdc42 is at a relatively low concentration in the experiment ( 50 nM ) ; addition of higher concentrations of Cdc42 will drive activation to higher levels approaching those of GST - VCA ( Figure 6A ) . ( C ) Effects of Cdc42 bound to different nucleotides on N - WASP . Actin polymerization ( 2 . 5 (cid:109) M actin and 60 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ) was stimulated by N - WASP at the indicated concentrations in the presence of Cdc42 ( 50 nM , GTP (cid:103) S or GDP (cid:98) S charged ) and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing vesicles ( 10 (cid:109) M , PC : PI : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , 48 : 48 : 4 ) . ( D ) Actin polymerization ( 2 . 5 (cid:109) M actin and 60 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ) was stimulated by N - WASP ( 5 nM ) in the presence of Cdc42 ( 50 nM , GTP (cid:103) S charged ) and the indicated concentrations of lipid vesicles containing PC / PI ( 50 : 50 ) or PC / PI / PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 48 : 48 : 4 ) . and full - length N - WASP is not due to the presence of and PH domains of N - WASP , respectively ( Figure 1A ) . Both domains are necessary forN - WASP to induce actin the GST domain fused to VCA . In the presence of 60 nM Arp2 / 3 and 2 . 5 (cid:109) M actin , 50 nM GST - VCA and 50 reorganization in fibroblasts ( Miki et al . , 1996 , 1998a ) . Addition of GTP (cid:103) S - charged Cdc42 had only a small nM VCA ( when cleaved from the GST moiety ) stimulated the elongation rate by 35 - fold and 25 - fold , respectively , effect on the activity of full - length N - WASP , increasing the elongation rate by (cid:122) 2 - fold and having no effect on compared to the 2 . 5 - fold stimulation obtained with a 4 - fold higher concentration ( 200 nM ) of full - length the duration of the lag phase ( Figure 6A ) . Likewise , lipid vesicles containing phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) , phospha - N - WASP . tidylinositol ( PI ) , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in a 48 : 48 : 4 ratio failed to activate N - WASP ( Figure 6A ) .

In fact , the ability of 200 nM N - WASP to activate extracts ( Miki et al . , 1998a ) . To identify potential up - stream regulators that may activate N - WASP in vitro , actin assembly in the presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and GTP (cid:103) S - Cdc42 was equal to that achieved by 200 nM GST - VCA we focused on Cdc42 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which have been implicated in actin assembly in Xenopus extracts ( Ma ( Figure 6A ) . To more precisely determine the activation potency of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and GTP (cid:103) S - Cdc42 , we compared et al . , 1998a ) .

Signal - DependentActinNucleation A speculative model for the mechanism by which signals , such as Cdc42 and lipids , may regulate actin assembly at membrane - proxi - mal sites by recruitment and activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex via N - WASP - like proteins . the elongation rate as a function of the concentration N - WASP and Actin Nucleation Although N - WASP has been implicated in many actin - of N - WASP , GST - VCA , or N - WASP activated by GTP (cid:103) S - Cdc42 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figure 6B ) . In the presence of dependent processes , such as filopodium formation ( Miki et al . , 1998a ) and the actin - based motility of Shi - Cdc42 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the potency of N - WASP was in - creased to a level approaching that of GST - VCA , sug - gella ( Suzuki et al . , 1998 ) , the mechanism by which it mediates actin polymerization has remained elusive . In gesting that N - WASP was fully activated by the two molecules . this report , we provide evidence that N - WASP stimu - lates actin nucleation , a kinetically unfavored step of The coordinate stimulation by Cdc42 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 favors GTP (cid:103) S - over GDP (cid:98) S - charged Cdc42 , but it is actin polymerization , by interacting with the Arp2 / 3 complex . not completely specific for the GTP form ( Figure 6C ) . Selectivity is most apparent under conditions where the An N - WASP fragment consisting of the C - terminal 55 amino acids ( CA region ) directly binds to the Arp2 / 3 concentration of N - WASP is below that of Cdc42 ( Figure 6C ) . At these low concentrations of N - WASP , the po - complex in vitro ( Figure 3 ) . This association is consistent with the observation that C - terminal segments of Scar1 / tency differenceof GTP (cid:103) S - overGDP (cid:98) S - charged Cdc42 is (cid:122) 5 - fold . Since the PH domain of N - WASP has been WAVE and WASP , both of which share homology with the corresponding region in N - WASP , can bind to the reported to bind specifically to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , we tested Arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) . However , whether the stimulation seen above is specific for a longer segment of N - WASP , including both the Arp2 / PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing vesicles ( Miki et al . , 1996 ) . While 3 - binding CA region and the actin - binding V region , is control lipid vesicles containing only PC and PI ( 50 : 50 ) required for the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex .

Disruption of pe - ripheral actin assembly is likely to be a consequence of The study of complex signal transduction networks competition for the Arp2 / 3 complex or actin or both . comprising many direct and indirect pathways requires The Listeria protein ActA can dramatically stimulate an integrated use of biochemical , genetic , and cell bio - the actin nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , as logical approaches .

This interaction mediates Cdc42 - induced in the presence of N - WASP , the Arp2 / 3 complex , or both actin polymerization in extracts and can be modulated ( data not shown ) . Although ActA and N - WASP share no significant sequence homology , they do share a short by both PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and Cdc42 .

HowisN - WASPregulatedby both Cdc42andPI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ? How do N - WASPand the Arp2 / 3 complexact together to stimulate actin nucleation ? Since the entire VCA do - Miki et al . have suggested that N - WASP is regulated by an allosteric mechanism ( 1998a ) . Full - length N - WASP main of N - WASP is required for its ability to stimulate actin polymerization , we favor a model ( Machesky and may exist in two conformations that are in equilibrium : an inactive conformation , in which the VCA domain is Insall , 1998 ) in which actin monomers and the Arp2 / 3 complex could be brought into proximity as a result of masked , and an active one in which the VCA domain is exposed and able to interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex . their interactions with the V and CA regions , respectively ( Figure 7 ) . In fact , the V domain is required for the ability At rest , N - WASP largely populates the inactive confor - mation . This is supported by two observations : ( 1 ) full - of N - WASP to remodel the actin cytoskeleton when overexpressed in cells ( Miki and Takenawa , 1998 ) . lengthN - WASPonlymodestlyactivatestheArp2 / 3com - plex ( in comparison to the isolated VCA fragment ) ; and ( 2 ) the full - length protein does not bind to the Arp2 / 3 Cdc42 Signaling and the N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 complex under conditions where the association be - Complex Interaction tween its VCA fragment and Arp2 / 3 is readily detectable .

N - WASP belongs to a family Experimental Procedures of proteins , including WASP , Scar1 / WAVE ( Bear et al . , Preparation of Xenopus Egg Extracts 1998 ; Miki et al . , 1998b ) , and Bee1 ( Li , 1997 ) , which and Phospholipid Vesicles share sequence homology at their C termini .
