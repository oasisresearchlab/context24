Nolte , 1 , 2 Esther N . M . Nolte - ' t Hoen , 3 and Coert Margadant 4 , * Integrins are transmembrane receptors that transduce biochemical and mechani - cal signals across the plasma membrane and promote cell adhesion and migration . In addition , integrin adhesion complexes are functionally and structurally linked to components of the intracellular traf ﬁ cking machinery and accumulating data now reveal that they are key regulators of endocytosis and exocytosis in a variety of cell types . Here , we highlight recent insights into integrin control of intracellular traf ﬁ cking in processes such as degranulation , mechanotransduction , cell – cell communication , antibody production , virus entry , Toll - like receptor signaling , autophagy , and phagocytosis , as well as the release and uptake of extracellular vesicles . We discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms and the implications for a range of pathophysiological contexts , including hemostasis , immunity , tissue repair , cancer , and viral infection . Integrins and Functions of Adhesion Complexes The integrin family consists of 24 heterodimeric transmembrane receptors assembled from 18 α - subunits and eight β - subunits . Integrins recognize a plethora of proteins either on the surface of other cells or in the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ( see Glossary ) and are essential for cell adhesion and spreading , migration , and ECM organization [ 1 ] . Furthermore , integrins trans - duce mechanical and biochemical signals across the plasma membrane and promote cell proliferation and survival [ 1 ] . The cytoplasmic tails of integrins regulate their af ﬁ nity for ligands , association with the cytoskeleton , and the assembly of adhesion complexes , which contain a variety of structural and adapter proteins and in addition serve as ‘ hubs ’ for signaling path - ways [ 2 – 4 ] . Most integrin adhesion complexes , including focal adhesions ( FAs ) , ﬁ brillar adhesions , immunological synapses , and podosomes , are linked to the actin cytoskeleton via a number of proteins such as talin , which bridges integrin β - tails with actin ﬁ laments ( Figure 1 , Key Figure ) [ 1 – 4 ] . Accumulating evidence indicates that integrin adhesion com - plexes also interact with microtubules , thus linking them to the intracellular traf ﬁ cking ma - chinery regulating exocytosis [ 5 , 6 ] . Furthermore , a new type of adhesion complex called flat clathrin lattice ( FCL ) has recently emerged , which is practically devoid of classical adhesion complex components but is instead highly enriched in proteins that promote endocytosis [ 7 ] . Indeed , it is increasingly recognized that there is extensive crosstalk between integrin - based adhesion sites , microtubules , and intracellular transport pathways , both to and from the cell surface [ 5 – 8 ] . While integrins themselves are subject to tight regulation by the traf ﬁ ck - ing machinery [ 9 – 13 ] , the mechanisms that control integrin traf ﬁ cking are discussed in detail elsewhere [ 14 , 15 ] . Here , we will focus on the latest ﬁ ndings in the ﬁ eld , showing that crosstalk between integrin adhesion complexes and the traf ﬁ cking machinery regulates the internalization and / or release of proteins , organelles , and microorganisms . Together , these studies illustrate nonconventional roles of integrins that are important for a wide variety of pathophysiological events , including hemostasis , immune responses , and tissue develop - ment and repair . Highlights Integrin adhesion complexes control polarized targeting of the intracellular traf ﬁ cking machinery via microtubules . Integrin adhesions are exocytic hubs for a variety of vesicles , including lytic and dense granules , lysosome - related organelles , and biosynthetic vesicles . Integrin - dependent adhesion and sig - naling is required for degranulation of platelets and leukocytes and controls hemostasis and immunity . Specialized adhesion complexes con - taining integrin α v β 5 and clathrin are sites of frustrated endocytosis and hubs for mechanotransduction .

Key Figure Integrins Promote Exocytosis of Biosynthetic and Secretory Vesicles TrendsTrends inin BiochemicalBiochemical Sciences Sciences Figure 1 . Integrins connect to the actin cytoskeleton via talin and remodel actin ﬁ laments via Rho GTPases , formins , and other proteins . Integrins also connect to microtubules via a complex of proteins , called the cortical microtubule stabilizing complex ( CMSC ) [ 22 ] . In this way , integrin adhesion sites are linked to the exocytic machinery , consisting of Rab GTPases , their effectors , and motor proteins . This machinery ensures the outward traf ﬁ c of Golgi - derived vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins ( biosynthetic pathway ) , as well as secretory vesicles , which store proteins that are released in response to a speci ﬁ c cue ( regulated secretion ) . Localized exocytosis of newly synthesized proteins occurs near integrin - controlled adhesion complexes [ 17 , 18 , 28 ] and is directed from the Golgi by guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) - H1 , an activator of RhoA that is associated with microtubules [ 29 ] .

Trends in Biochemical Sciences 2 Trends in Biochemical Sciences , Month2020 , Vol . xx , No . xx Connections of Integrin Adhesion Complexes to Microtubules and the Traf ﬁ cking Machinery Intracellular traf ﬁ cking of organelles relies on Rab GTPases , which in their active , GTP - bound state are recruited to intracellular membranes and promote vesicle transport , fusion , and ﬁ ssion . Rabs enable the movement of organelles via effector proteins that can simultaneously bind acti - vated Rabs and motor proteins such as myosins ( which move along actin ) or kinesins / dyneins ( which move along microtubules ) ( Figure 1 ) [ 16 ] . Microtubules growing toward the cell surface are captured and stabilized by integrin adhesion complexes , via proteins that bind their growing or ‘ plus ’ ends , including cytoplasmic linker - associated proteins ( CLASPs ) [ 17 – 20 ] . These interact at the plasma membrane with a protein complex containing LL5 family ( also called Pleckstrin homology - like domain family B ) of proteins , which bind phospholipids in the plasma membrane , and ELKS ( ERC1 / Rab6 interacting / CAST family member 1 / RAB6IP2 ) ( Figure 1 ) [ 5 , 17 – 19 , 21 , 22 ] . The latter is an effector protein for the small GTPase Rab6 , which regulates bidirectional traf ﬁ c be - tween the Golgi network and the cell surface [ 23 ] . The entire complex is de ﬁ ned as the cortical microtubule stabilizing complex ( CMSC ) , and consists furthermore of adapter proteins called liprins and the recently identi ﬁ ed KN motif and ANKyrin repeat domain - containing ( KANK ) pro - teins [ 21 , 22 , 24 – 26 ] . KANKs associate with liprins and the kinesin KIF21A , while their N terminal domains bind directly to talin , and thereby link microtubules to integrins ( Figure 1 ) [ 22 , 25 , 26 ] . Since microtubules provide polarized tracks for long - range vesicular transport , integrins thus tar - get the traf ﬁ cking machinery to discrete membrane domains . In addition , many exocytic vesicles use actin ﬁ laments for movement , which is also indirectly affected by adhesion complexes , either because integrins are linked to actin ﬁ laments , or because they control local actin remodeling via proteins such as zyxin , formins , Rho GTPases , and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 1 ) [ 2 ] . Finally , the cytoplasmic tails of some integrin β - subunits can also bind directly to the motor protein Myosin - 10 , which regulates adhesion and ﬁ lopodia formation [ 27 ] . Thus , several structural and functional inter - actions exist that link integrin adhesion complexes , cytoskeletal elements , and the intracellular traf ﬁ cking machinery . Integrin Adhesion Complexes Regulate Exocytosis of Biosynthetic and Secretory Vesicles Golgi - derived vesicles in the biosynthetic pathway are transported along microtubules to the cell surface under the control of Rab6 or Rab8 in a myosin - II - dependent manner , where they dock and fuse with the plasma membrane preferentially in the vicinity of adhesion complexes ( Figure 1 ) [ 17 , 19 , 23 ] . This has been observed in epithelial cells such as keratinocytes , as well as in cancer cells , and requires the capture of microtubules through CLASP - LL5 interactions , while ELKS regulates vesicle docking [ 17 – 19 , 21 , 23 ] . Using an assay to induce synchronized release of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum into the biosynthetic pathway , it was recently revealed that ECM proteins , but also a variety of other cargos , are exocytosed near adhesion complexes [ 28 , 29 ] . This is an intriguing ﬁ nding since it suggests that membrane domains near adhesions are particularly permissive for exocytosis in general . Furthermore , localized delivery is already directed from the Golgi , in a manner dependent on Rho and guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) - H1 ( Figure 1 ) , an activator of Rho GTPases associated with microtubules [ 29 ] . In addition to regulating outward transport along the biosynthetic pathway , integrins are also emerging as regulators of secretory vesicle exocytosis ( Figure 1 ) . In the pancreatic islets of Langerhans , β - cells make and secrete insulin into the vasculature . The β - cells are polarized by contacts with the basement membrane that surrounds capillaries , where integrins assemble ad - hesion complexes enriched in liprins and ELKS [ 30 ] . These integrins direct insulin - containing granules to the cell surface , which is disrupted by blockade of integrin – ligand binding , or by pharmacological inhibition of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , an important signaling component in Interferons ( IFNs ) : cytokines secreted in response to infection . Macrophages : phagocyticwhiteblood cells that destroy pathogens and apoptotic cells . Microtubules : cytoskeletal ﬁ laments that transport vesicles to and from the cell periphery . Microvesicle : extracellular vesicle derivedfromthecellsurfacebybudding . Natural killer cell : innate immune cells that clear viral infections or cancer cells . Opsonization : coating of a particle to facilitate phagocytosis . Phagocytosis : engulfment of large particles , such as microbesor apoptotic cells , by specialized cells . Platelets : cell fragments in the circulation , required for blood clotting . Rab GTPase : small protein residing on intracellular membranes that mediates intracellular transport .

Toll - like receptors : transmembrane immune receptors that detect particular molecules derived from pathogens . von Willebrand Factor ( vWF ) : large multimeric adhesive protein required for hemostasis , released from endothelial cells . Weibel - Palade body ( WPB ) : secretoryvesiclesinendothelialcellsthat store and release vWF . Trends in Biochemical Sciences Trends in Biochemical Sciences , Month2020 , Vol . xx , No . xx 3 FAs [ 30 ] . Indeed , the targeted deletion of the gene encoding FAK in β - cells impairs insulin secretion in mice due to impaired granule targeting to the plasma membrane , while glucose sensing and response to glucose are normal [ 31 ] . By contrast , deletion of the gene encoding β 1 in these cells does not disrupt insulin secretion in mice , which may indicate functional redundancy among integrins in regulating this process [ 32 ] . In endothelial cells , several FA proteins were found to promote the secretion of von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) from secretory organelles called Weibel - Palade bodies ( WPBs ) . The strongest effect was observed for zyxin , which is an actin - binding protein important for the connection of FAs to actin ﬁ laments . Zyxin is required for actin remodeling around sites of WPB exocytosis . Since vWF secretion from WPBs is required for the trapping of platelets and subsequent platelet aggregation , mice that do not express zyxin suffer from prolonged bleeding times and impaired thrombus formation [ 33 ] . Intriguingly , it remains to be determined which subcellular zyxin pool is responsible for the observed effects , since WPB release of vWF occurs primarily at the apical surface facing the vascular lumen , while FAs are mostly assembled on the basal surface where integrins bind the basement membrane . Integrin Adhesion Complexes Regulate Platelet and Leukocyte Degranulation Integrins are essential for hemostasis and immunity , because they regulate platelet aggregation , leukocyte adhesion and migration , and transforming growth factor - β activation [ 34 , 35 ] . In addi - tion , it is becoming clear that integrins also control vesicular traf ﬁ cking in platelets and leukocytes at several levels . In activated lymphocytes , the immunological synapse is a prime example of an integrin - formed structure that is also a site of heavy intracellular traf ﬁ c [ 36 ] . In cytotoxic T cells , the recognition of cognate antigen on an adjacent target cell will induce microtubule anchoring at the peripheral supramolecular activation cluster ; a ring surrounding the clustered T cell recep - tors that consists of abundant α L β 2 ligated to intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) on the adjacent target cell [ 37 ] . Driven by T cell receptor signaling , this adhesion complex enables the polarized degranulation of lytic granules into the immunological synapse ( Figure 2A ) [ 38 ] . Simi - larly , α L β 2 – ligand interactions also cooperate with other receptors at the cell surface to induce granule convergence in natural killer cells ( i . e . , the orientation of granules at the microtubule organizing center and their subsequent directed exocytosis ) , which enhances speci ﬁ c targeting and reduces a - speci ﬁ c ‘ bystander ’ killing [ 39 ] . Integrin - dependent granule convergence is achieved by a number of regulatory protein networks downstream of α L β 2 , including common components of integrin - based adhesions such as integrin - linked kinase , Pyk2 , and paxillin [ 40 ] . Furthermore , the binding of integrin α E β 7 on CD8 T cells to E - cadherin on tumor cells mediates lytic granule polarization and subsequent exocytosis [ 41 ] . Because lytic granule release requires interactions with cortical actin ﬁ laments , proteins that are important for local actin remodeling , such as zyxin , may also be involved here , as described earlier for endothelial cells . Integrin function in platelets is also intimately linked to the degranulation machinery . In isolated human platelets in vitro , α - granule exocytosis occurs primarily at sites where integrins promote platelet spreading , through activation of Rac - dependent actin polymerization [ 42 ] . Rac is also required for degranulation , and the release of ﬁ bronectin and ﬁ brinogen from α - granules stimu - lates further integrin ligation and platelet spreading ( Figure 2B ) . Thus , a feedforward loop exists between integrins , Rac activation , and degranulation [ 43 ] . Importantly , granule secretion and integrin α IIb β 3 - dependent platelet aggregation in vivo are still supported by β 1 integrin amounts as low as 3 % of the normal expression levels , whereas this is not suf ﬁ cient for platelet adhesion . This suggests that β 1 integrins regulate hemostasis predominantly by promoting granule release , rather than by platelet adhesion [ 43 ] . Integrin - mediated Rac activation and platelet spreading , as well as RhoA - dependent clot retraction , also require Vps33B , a component of sorting / tethering Trends in Biochemical Sciences 4 Trends in Biochemical Sciences , Month2020 , Vol . xx , No . xx TrendsTrends inin BiochemicalBiochemical Sciences Sciences Figure 2 . Integrins Control Leukocyte and Platelet Degranulation , Important for Immunity and Hemostasis . ( A ) Upon antigen recognition on target cells by cytotoxic T cells , a tight interaction is established through α L β 2 and intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) , which enables local release of lytic granules to kill the target cell , thereby preventing collateral damage to other cells [ 37 – 39 ] . Integrin - dependent granule convergence is achieved by a number of regulatory protein networks downstream of α L β 2 [ 40 ] and directed granule traf ﬁ cking through Rab27 . ( B ) In platelets , activation of the integrin α IIb β 3 is essential for platelet spreading and aggregation , as well as clot formation and retraction . Ligation and signaling from β 1 integrins are required for the release of ﬁ bronectin and ﬁ brinogen from platelet α - granules , which stimulates further platelet spreading and aggregation [ 42 ] . Moreover , Rho - mediated clot - retraction and Rac - mediated platelet spreading are dependent on α IIb β 3 endocytic traf ﬁ cking , which is regulated by ADP - ribosylation factor 6 ( Arf6 ) and vacuolar protein sorting - associated protein 33B ( Vps33B ) [ 44 , 46 ] . Trends in Biochemical Sciences Trends in Biochemical Sciences , Month2020 , Vol . xx , No . xx 5 complexes on vesicular compartments [ 44 ] . Vps33B promotes the biogenesis of α - granules , as well as their exocytosis , and patients with mutations in Vps33B develop a multiorgan disorder with bleedings [ 45 ] . Intriguingly , Vps33B binds directly to β 1 and β 3 integrin cytoplasmic tails at a site partially overlapping with that of talin and was previously shown to localize to recycling vesicles , which transport internalized integrins [ 13 , 44 ] . Thus , Vps33B links integrin function and traf ﬁ cking to platelet degranulation . Another traf ﬁ cking protein , the GTPase Arf6 , was also shown to enhance platelet spreading [ 46 ] . Because Arf6 is required for ﬁ brinogen uptake by α IIb β 3 , it may link integrin turnover to platelet function . Integrin Crosstalk with the Endocytic Machinery Regulates Adhesion Turnover , Mechanotransduction , and Phagocytosis Integrins also have extensive crosstalk with the endocytic machinery . Microtubules deliver endocytic machinery to FAs and trigger their disassembly by internalizing FA components via clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 6 , 8 , 47 , 48 ] . Clathrin adapter proteins , such as AP - 2 , ARH , Dab2 , and Numb , bind directly to the cytoplasmic tails of integrin α - or β - subunits and recruit them into clathrin - coated pits , which are subsequently internalized and delivered to early endosomes ( Figure 3 ) [ 12 , 14 , 49 ] . Indeed , FA disassembly is blocked by disruption of microtubule TrendsTrends inin BiochemicalBiochemical Sciences Sciences Figure 3 . Integrin Crosstalk with the Clathrin Machinery Regulates Adhesion Turnover , Mechanotransduction , and Endocytosis . Microtubules deliver clathrin adaptors that trigger disassembly of focal adhesions ( FAs ) and recruit the integrins and their ligands into clathrin - coated pits [ 47 , 48 ] . Binding of clathrin adaptors to integrins is also involved in the formation of the more static ﬂ at clathrin lattices ( FCLs ) , which develop when α v β 5 forms stable interactions with immobilized vitronectin ; this prevents the formation of pits and thereby ‘ frustrates ’ the endocytic process [ 52 , 55 , 59 ] . These structures depend on high rigidity of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ligands , but are associated with low intracellular tension , as they do not depend on myosin II - activity [ 60 ] . Yet , increases in cytoskeletal tension , for example , by guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) - H1 / RhoA - mediated actomyosin contractility in response to microtubule depolymerization , stimulate FA assembly and integrin translocation from the FCLs to FAs [ 59 , 65 ] .

Trends in Biochemical Sciences 6 Trends in Biochemical Sciences , Month2020 , Vol . xx , No . xx polymerization , in part because endocytic machinery is no longer delivered to FAs , but also because GEF - H1 is released from microtubules under these conditions , thus triggering a local burst in myosin - IIA ﬁ lament assembly via the RhoA - Rho kinase pathway [ 26 , 50 ] . In addition to clathrin - coated pits , clathrin can also assemble very large , sheet - like structures named clathrin - coated plaques , clathrin sheets , or FCLs [ 51 – 54 ] . FCLs are highly enriched in endocytic pro - teins , but in contrast to pits , they are static and long - lived structures that persist throughout the cell cycle , even during mitosis [ 55 ] . Most endocytic proteins in FCLs distribute to the periphery of these structures , which is indeed also where budding pits are observed ( Figure 3 ) [ 56 ] . This is consistent with the observation that clathrin coats ﬁ rst grow ﬂ at , but that bending begins upon a change in the ratio between clathrin and the adapter AP - 2 [ 57 , 58 ] . Hence , the center of the FCL has very low endocytic activity and its assembly is considered to result from ‘ frustrated endocytosis ’ [ 52 ] . It is now increasingly recognized that this ‘ frustration ’ is the result of tight adhesion of FCLs to the sub - strate by integrin α v β 5 ( Figure 3 ) [ 7 , 55 , 59 ] . Whereas α v β 5 can ef ﬁ ciently uptake several ligands such as vitronectin , interaction of this integrin with immobilized vitronectin prevents the formation of pits , but stimulates plaque formation [ 60 ] . Similarly , β 1 integrins have been shown to promote the forma - tion of tubular clathrin lattices along collagen ﬁ bers , which regulate cell adhesion in an endocytosis - independent manner [ 61 ] . Therefore , FCLs are now increasingly recognized as a novel type of adhesion complex ( and have also been named ‘ reticular adhesions ’ ) , although they lack classical adhesion components and have low amounts of talin [ 7 , 59 ] . Furthermore , FCLs are not linked to actin stress ﬁ bers like FAs , but they are associated with branched cortical actin , generated by the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 51 , 62 ] . In turn , cortical actin recruits the intermediate ﬁ lament system to these structures [ 63 ] . FCL assembly requires α v β 5 - vitronectin interaction and recruitment of clathrin adap - tors such as ARH , Numb , and EPS15 / EPS15L1 to the β 5 cytoplasmic tail [ 59 ] . Integrin cytoplasmic tails can induce profound differences in the behavior of distinct integrins , even when they bind the same ligand [ 64 ] , which is most likely due to differences in the relative af ﬁ nities for speci ﬁ c proteins . The cytotail of α v β 5 contains an insert of eight amino acids , as compared with integrin β 1 or β 3 tails [ 34 ] , and may have an exceptionally high af ﬁ nity for clathrin adaptors . Consistent with this idea is the observation that swapping the β 5 tail with that of β 1 or β 3 induces a redistribution to FAs [ 59 ] . Although FCL assembly increases with high substrate rigidity , their assembly is independent of myosin - II activity [ 60 ] . In fact , high intracellular tension generated by actomyosin contractility trig - gers translocation of α v β 5 to FAs , while low tension promotes its localization to FCLs ( Figure 3 ) [ 59 , 65 ] . Conversely , recruitment of Dab2 and Numb to ligated α v β 3 , as well as a loss of talin from these complexes , is promoted by the absence of physical forces [ 66 ] . Thus , modulation of cellular tension affects selective integrin recruitment to adhesion complexes . In addition , FCLs also regulate signaling and cell proliferation [ 51 , 60 ] . So far , FCLs have only been observed in muscle in vivo , but they are likely important in other cell types as well [ 62 , 63 ] . For example , macrophages are special - ized for the uptake of large objects such as microorganisms or apoptotic cells by phagocytosis , which is dependent on integrin α v β 5 [ 67 , 68 ] . Indeed , deletion of the gene encoding β 5 in hemato - poietic cells in mice impairs tissue repair by intestinal macrophages and increases susceptibility to chemical colitis [ 68 ] . Furthermore , retinal pigment epithelial cells rely on α v β 5 for the phagocytosis of retinal debris such as spent photoreceptor outer segment fragments , which is critical for vision . In the absence of α v β 5 , mice fail to clear this debris and develop age - related blindness [ 69 ] . It is con - ceivable that FCLs affect phagocytosis in specialized cell types , which will require further investigation . Integrins Control Uptake of Extracellular Vesicles and Viruses Another emerging role for integrins in vesicle traf ﬁ c relates to the binding and uptake of extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) . These are cell - derived , 50 – 1000 nm sized vesicles of different subcellular origin , including exosomes , which originate from late endosomal compartments ( multivesicular bodies ) , and microvesicles , which bud from the plasma membrane ( Figure 4 ) [ 70 ] . Accumulating evidence Trends in Biochemical Sciences Trends in Biochemical Sciences , Month2020 , Vol . xx , No . xx 7 TrendsTrends inin BiochemicalBiochemical Sciences Sciences ( See ﬁ gure legend at the bottom of the next page . ) Trends in Biochemical Sciences 8 Trends in Biochemical Sciences , Month2020 , Vol . xx , No . xx implicates EVs in a wide range of pathophysiological processes , including tissue regenera - tion , cancer , and cardiovascular disease . Virtually every cell type can produce EVs , which enables them to dispose of intracellular content or to communicate with other cells . The latter is mediated either by EV - induced signaling at the target cell membrane , or by transfer of their molecular cargo , such as small RNAs , proteins , or lipids , to target cells [ 70 ] . Integrins play an important role herein , as EVs derived from many different cell types contain integrin ligands , including ICAM - 1 and / or vascular cell - adhesion molecule - 1 , which enables them to bind β 2 or β 1 integrins on the target cell ( Figure 4 ) . For example , EVs produced by dendritic cells ( DCs ) can bind to activated T cells and to DCs through α L β 2 [ 71 , 72 ] . Conversely , various β 1 and β 2 integrins have also been detected on EVs , allowing these vesicles to bind to target cells and / or ECM components [ 73 – 75 ] . Interestingly , integrins on EVs can even mediate tumor metastasis to a particular tissue : α v β 5 mediates tumor - EV binding to Kupffer cells , which facilitates liver metastasis , whereas α 6 β 4 facilitates binding to lung ﬁ broblasts and thereby promotes metastasis to the lungs [ 76 ] . Recent data indicate that integrins in cancer cell EVs may also regulate tumor - induced angiogenesis . Integrin α v β 6 - containing EVs released by prostate cancer cells mediate α v β 6 transfer to microvas - cular endothelial cells and promote endothelial cell motility and tube formation , in contrast to EVs isolated from β 6 negative cancer cells [ 77 ] . Finally , integrins can regulate the sorting of ﬁ bronectin into cancer cell EVs , as well as the contents and antibacterial activity of neu - trophil EVs , although how integrins crosstalk with the sorting machinery remains to be established [ 75 , 78 ] . In addition to EVs , a variety of pathogens , including bacteria and viruses , can also use integrins such as α v β 3 and α v β 5 for cell attachment , which is of interest for possible therapeutic intervention ( Figure 4 ) [ 79 , 80 ] . For example , Zika virus uses α v β 5 to enter tar - get cells and blocking this integrin reduces viral infection and alleviates virus - induced pa - thology [ 81 ] . Moreover , coronaviruses may also use integrins to infect cells . Accessory protein - 7a of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) - coronavirus SARS - CoV - 1 , in - teracts directly with α L β 2 [ 82 ] . In addition , the spike protein of SARS - CoV - 2 , which causes coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , contains an integrin - binding RGD motif that is absent from other coronaviruses [ 83 ] . Various naked viruses , such as Picornaviridae and Hepeviridae , can escape infected cells already in the prelytic phase of infection , via packaging and release within EVs ( Figure 4 ) [ 84 , 85 ] . This stealth mode prevents viruses from being neutralized by antibodies , but these virions also become dependent on EV - targeting pathways to infect new cells , as they are cloaked by a host - derived membrane . To what extent these EV - enclosed virions express the same adhesion molecules as normal EVs remains to be investigated , though it is likely that integrins are also involved in this novel mechanism of viral dissemination . Indeed , both naked and EV - enclosed virions of hepatitis A virus are dependent on β 1 integrins for viral entry , although they interact with distinct integrin domains [ 86 ] . It will be important to determine how viruses and EVs make use of overlapping mechanisms for target cell binding and cargo delivery and to what extent integrins play a role . Figure 4 . Integrins Control Binding and Uptake of Extracellular Vesicles and Viruses . Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) are either derived from multivesicular bodies ( exosomes ) , or bud from the plasma membrane ( microvesicles ) . Integrins and / or integrin ligands on the surface of EVs can mediate EV binding to target cells . Following binding , EVs can induce signaling into the target cell ( i ) and / or transfer their content into the cell ( ii ) . Enveloped viruses can use envelope proteins to bind integrins on target cells prior to viral entry . Various naked viruses can be released by infected cells at the prelytic stage via packaging into host EVs , which may allow integrin - mediated entry of target cells ( iii ) .

Some integrins are cotraf ﬁ cked through the endosomal system with receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) , such as epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor - 2 ( Figure 5 ) [ 87 , 88 ] . The relationship between the involved RTKs and integrins is reciprocal , as the RTKs affect integrin traf ﬁ c and vice versa . This is controlled by growth factor stimulation , as well as by proteins that associate with the cytoplasmic tails of these receptors , including kinases and Rab - coupling protein [ 87 , 89 , 90 ] . While it has long been known that integrins signal in a synergistic manner with growth factors to regulate cell survival , proliferation , and migration , it is now apparent that both integrin and RTK signaling does not occur exclusively from the plasma membrane , but continues from endosomal compartments after internalization ( Figure 5 ) . In fact , endocytosis of ligand - occupied integrins is required to achieve optimal signaling toward FAK , as well as to the AKT and extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) pathways [ 91 ] . Endosomal integrin signaling can potentiate RTK signaling from these compartments and contributes to anchorage - independent growth and anoikis resistance in cancer cells [ 91 , 92 ] . Integrin traf ﬁ cking may also regulate pro - liferation at the level of nutrient sensing , as it has been shown that the delivery of internalized , ligand - engaged α 5 β 1 integrins to late endosomes / lysosomes regulates the recruitment and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin , a key regulator of cell growth in response to nutrients [ 93 ] . It is also becoming clear that integrins associate with pathways that regulate autophagy , which is responsible for the recycling of nutrients during starvation as well as for antigen presentation and the digestion of microbes . Autophagy involves the formation of intracellular compartments , including autophagosomes , that are coated with microtubule - associated protein 1A / 1B light chains 3B ( LC3 ) and fuse with lysosomes to degrade their contents [ 94 ] . Intriguingly , internalized β 1 integrins cotraf ﬁ c with activated c - Met toward LC3 - containing vesicles in cancer cells , where they sustain c - Met signaling [ 92 ] . Furthermore , α v integrins , most importantly α v β 3 , can stimulate the recruitment of Toll - like receptor ( TLR ) 9 into LC3 - positive compartments in B cells ( Figure 5 ) , and deletion of the genes encoding either α v or β 3 results in enhanced and prolonged TLR signaling and increased B cell activation [ 95 ] . It remains to be determined how α v β 3 exerts these effects , but because α v β 3 can directly interact with TLRs , the integrin – TLR complex possibly cotraf ﬁ cs through the endosomal system [ 96 ] . Furthermore , it is well established that the cytoplasmic tail of β 3 is particularly effective in recruiting Src kinase and spleen tyrosine kinase ( Syk ) , which can negatively regulate TLR signaling ( Figure 5 ) . While TLR signaling toward NF - κ B and interferon ( IFN ) - regulatory factor pathways promotes B cell function in germinal centers ( GCs ) , it needs to be tightly regulated to prevent the generation of high - af ﬁ nity autoantibodies [ 97 ] . Indeed , increased TLR9 signaling induced by α v β 3 deletion causes expansion of GC , memory , and plasma cells and increases class switching and somatic hypermutation . Together , these events strongly augment the generation of high - af ﬁ nity antibodies , both to foreign and ‘ self ’ antigens associated with TLR ligands [ 98 ] . It is conceivable that α v β 3 functions as a ‘ sensor ’ that regulates TLR signaling , stimulating necessary responses against pathogens but preventing excessive responses leading to autoimmunity . This hypothesis ﬁ ts well with studies showing that α v β 3 functions as a coreceptor for the phagocytosis of viruses and microbes and enhances TLR - mediated innate immune responses induced by herpes simplex virus or bacterial ligands [ 99 , 100 ] . Moreover , several observations suggest that α M β 2 may similarly control the balance in TLR signaling . First , α M β 2 stimulates the uptake of Listeria monocytogenes and other ( complement - opsonized ) bacteria into LC3 - positive compartments [ 101 , 102 ] , and negatively regulates TLR - dependent proin ﬂ ammatory signaling and IFN Trends in Biochemical Sciences 10 Trends in Biochemical Sciences , Month2020 , Vol . xx , No . xx production , in a manner involving Src and Syk [ 103 ] ( Figure 5 ) . Second , genetic variations in the α M - subunit are strongly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and it is now clear that these mutations not only lead to dysfunctional integrins that cannot promote cell adhesion or TrendsTrends inin BiochemicalBiochemical Sciences Sciences Figure 5 . Integrin Regulation of Vesicular Traf ﬁ cking and Autophagy Pathways Controls Receptor Signaling . Integrinsregulateendocyticrecyclingofreceptor tyrosine kinases , such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) , under the control of growth factors and proteins that associate with their cytoplasmic tails [ 87 , 89 , 90 ] . Moreover , internalized integrins cosignal with these receptors from endosomes toward the extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) and AKT pathways , to synergistically drive cell proliferation and survival [ 91 , 92 ] . Some integrins mediate phagocytosis of ( complement - opsonized ) pathogens , such as herpes simplex virus and Listeria monocytogenes [ 99 , 100 ] . Following internalization , these integrins can induce the recruitment of microtubule - associated protein 1A / 1B light chains 3B ( LC3 ) to form autophagosomes , which fuse with lysosomes to degrade the pathogens [ 94 , 95 ] . Integrin α v β 3 can directly interact with certain Toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) and limit their signaling , possibly through recruitment of Src and Syk , thereby decreasing cellular activation [ 95 ] . Moreover , α M β 2 signaling through Src and Syk can also inhibit TLR signaling toward NF - κ B and interferon - regulatory factor 3 pathways [ 101 – 105 ] . Several integrins may therefore function as a ‘ sensor ’ that regulates TLR signaling by stimulating necessary responses against pathogens but preventing excessive responses leading to autoimmunity .

Finally , pharmacological activation of α M β 2 suppressed TLR - dependent in ﬂ ammation and autoimmunity in a mouse model for lupus [ 105 ] . Thus , it is now clear that integrins can control signaling pathways initiated by a variety of receptors , by directing phagocytosis , autophagy , and receptor traf ﬁ cking . Concluding Remarks Integrins have now ﬁ rmly emerged as crucial regulators of vesicular traf ﬁ c in a wide range of cell types . Not only do they target the biosynthetic machinery toward the plasma membrane , but they are also involved in a variety of endocytic , phagocytic , and secretory events that together regulate many aspects of human health and disease . Much remains to be learned about the involved machinery and the signals that drive integrin - dependent vesicular transport ( see Outstanding Questions ) . Further research is required to determine the regulation and in vivo function of FCLs , the function of integrin – autophagy crosstalk in immune responses , and the role of integrins in the transfer of EVs and viruses . Finally , it will be important to explore if the described mecha - nisms can be employed therapeutically .
