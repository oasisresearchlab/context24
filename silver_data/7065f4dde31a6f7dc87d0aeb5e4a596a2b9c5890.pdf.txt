Unlike the conventional culture dish method , two different epidermal cells are successfully adhered to the front and back sides of the patch , which produces a three - dimensional nanofibrous scaffold similar to a natural extracellular matrix before the patch was cultured in the skin - on - a - chip device to mimic the physiological conditions of human skin . As expected , the differentiated hiPSCs show the expression of keratinocyte - and fibroblast - specific proteins on the patch , and the layering is found between these two kinds of cells , indicating that this approach creates a powerful in vitro system for modeling skin development and diseases .

Skin models should be composed of different cell types cultured in various layers exposed to spatiotemporal chemical gradients and mechanical forces . Such a skin model would be able to mimic the biomimetic function of cells , with the possibility of long - term cell culturing and real - time monitoring of the tissue behavior in a controlled microenvironment [ 4 ] . Therefore , various cell resources and a real - time monitoring platform are in demand for 3D skin model generation . One of the main challenges in engineering skin tissues is the selection of the appropriate cell sources . The majority of skin constructs cited above consisted of matured keratinocytes and fibroblast cells , isolated from human or animal skin . Their usages were limit - ed due to the long culturing cycle , insufficient levels of proliferation and differentiation , a lack of a donor site , and immune rejection in allogeneic or autologous sources [ 5 ] . Stem cells have the capability of differenti - ating to different types of skin cells and are an excep - tional source of cells for the next generation of skin models . Induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) are known to be epigenetically similar to human embryon - ic stem cells ( hESCs ) [ 6 , 7 ] ; the main advantage of iPSCs with respect to ESCs is the lack of immune rejection after transplantation , along with fewer ethical concerns than when using ESCs [ 8 ] . By using combinations of inductive or reprogramming factors , the direct in vitro 1272 Vol . 37 No . 6 LUO Zhang et al : Integrated Organ - on - a - chip with Human - induced Pluripot . . . differentiation of iPSCs into cells such as fibroblasts , collagen producing cells , and keratinocytes has been described for the skin regeneration and disease mod - el [ 9 - 11 ] . The integration of 3D tissue - engineered con - structs with microﬂuidic network systems , organ - on - a - chip , provides a novel platform for drug testing and tis - sue regeneration . The system geometry and structures recreate physiological length scales and concentration gradients , and the ﬂuid ﬂow generates mechanical forces that mimic the in vivo microenvironment experi - enced by cells [ 12 , 13 ] . These highly biomimetic platforms overcome the drawbacks with conventional tissue culture models [ 14 ] . Better mimicking the physiological conditions and more accurately predicting the effect of drug carriers , these sophisticated in vitro screen - ing models can fill the gap between the outcomes of animal studies and human clinical trials . The field of biomimetic organs - on - a - chip has expanded rapidly to encompass several organs , including the liver , kidney , heart , gut , breast , and blood vessels [ 15 - 17 ] . These studies have already shown that organ - on - a - chip platforms can generate responses similar to those observed in vivo toward nanoparticles [ 18 ] . Furthermore , multiple organ modules can be interconnected at a physiologically rel - evant scale and organized to form a human - on - a - chip platform [ 19 , 20 ] . Therefore , the organ - on - a - chip is an ideal platform to culture and monitor a 3D skin model , since it has the potential to offer physiologically relevant dis - ease modeling and drug evaluation . In this study , we used microﬂuidic technology to develop a human skin - on - a - chip model consisting of two layers , epidermal and dermal ; each layer was sepa - rated and interacted with using a culture patch made of monolayer poly - ( lactic - co - glycolic acid ) ( PLGA ) nano - fibers on the poly - ( ethylene glycol ) diacrylate ( PEGDA ) poroid microframe to mimic skin biology . The culture patch was prepared as illustrated in Scheme 1 ( a ) . Ke - ratinocytes and fibroblasts , derived from iPSCs , which are sufficient for proliferation and differentiation , were plated on the front and back of the culture patch ( Scheme 1 ( b ) ) and finally cultured on the skin - on - a - chip for 10 days ( Scheme 1 ( c ) ) to simulate the physi - ological conditions . The proposed model can also be used for investigating critical skin diseases and testing of the toxicity of drugs . 2 Experimental 2 . 1 Materials The negative photoresist SU8 - 3050 was obtained from Microchem , America .

Sci . Ed . www . jwutms . net Dec . 2022 plement and DKSFM were purchased from Invitrogen ( Waltham , USA ) . All other chemicals used in this study were analytical grade . All solutions were prepared with ultrapure water obtained from a Millipore water purifi - cation system ( Millipore , USA ) . 2 . 2 Preparation of a PEGDA patch The patch frame made of PEGDA was fabricated by UV - assisted molding using a PDMS mold . First , a chromium mask of the poroid network 200 μm in diam - eter and with a 250 - μm distance between the centers of the circles was produced using a micropattern genera - tor ( μPG501 , Heidelberg Instruments , Germany ) . Then , a silicon wafer was spin - coated with a 50 - μm thick photoresist film ( SU8 - 3050 ) and was exposed to UV light , putting on the mask . After developing the silicon , we obtained the template . A mixture of the PDMS pre - polymer and the cross - linker was prepared at a ratio of 10 : 1 and poured on the template . After curing at 80°C for 4 h , the PDMS layer was peeled off and placed on a glass slide . The PDMS - glass assembly was placed in a desiccator for degassing for 15 min . A PEGDA solution mixed with 5 v % / v % benzoin dimethyl ether as a photoinitiator was prepared and injected through the punched PDMS mold on the glass to fill the cavity of the PDMS - glass assembly ( due to microaspiration ) . Then , a poroid frame of PEGDA was formed after UV exposure and peeling it off the PDMS mold . For easier handling , a 100 - μm thick PEGDA ring with a 13 - μm outer diameter and 8 - um inner diameter was prepared in a similar manner and mounted on the poroid frame using precured PEGDA solution as a binder with UV curing . Finally , the PEGDA period frame was gently taken off with the ring using a scalpel . 2 . 3 Preparation of monolayer nanofibers We dissolved 15 % PLGA in a mixture of dimeth - yl formamide and tetrahydrofuran with a volume ratio of 3 : 1 before electrospinning . Then , the PEGDA patch was put on the aluminum foil , which served as a collec - tor . After loading the PLGA solution into a syringe , it was ejected into the collector at a distance of 120 mm using a syringe pump at a 0 . 3 - mL / h pumping speed through a stainless steel 23 - gauge needle . The spinneret was connected to the anode of a high potential power supply with a bias voltage of 18 kV , and the collector was connected to the cathode of the power supply . Af - terward , the samples were dried in a vacuum overnight to eliminate the remaining solvent . Finally , a culture patch was obtained . The pore size distribution and po - rosity of the nanofibers were analyzed using a Nano Measurer . Three samples under the same conditions were analyzed . For each of them , no less than three areas at different locations were used to obtain the av - erage value and the standard deviation of the porosity . 2 . 4 Differentiation of iPSCs into keratin - ocytes IPSCs have been previously differentiated into keratinocytes by several methods [ 9 , 10 , 21 , 22 ] . Small clumps of iPSCs were sub - cultured on a dish coated with Matrigel® hesc - qualified matrix in PSCeasy TM human pluripotent stem cell ( ES / iPS ) medium for 1 day . The iPSCs were treated in DKSFM supplemented with 1 μM RA , 10 ng / m L BMP - 4 , and 1 . 5 mM CaCl 2 . After 6 days , the initiation medium was changed to DKSFM , and the cells were maintained in the culture until day 16 . At day 17 , the medium was changed to the CnT - 07 medium , and the cells were kept in the culture for expansion and maintenance . In addition , every kind of medium was refreshed every 2 days . 2 . 5 Differentiation of iPSCs into fibroblasts IPSCs have been previously differentiated into fibroblasts by several methods [ 11 ] . EBs were first gen - erated in the AggreWell™ Medium supplemented with 0 . 3 mM AA , 10 ng / mL TGFβ2 , and ITS - A supplement ( diluted according to the manufacturer’s instructions ) on a low attachment surface dish for 4 days . EBs were attached to a Matrigel® hesc - qualified matrix - coated dish to induce cell outgrowth and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0 . 3 mM AA and 15 % bovine serum for 15 days . Cells were passaged and cultured every week to obtain consistent spindle - shaped cells in the DMEM supplemented with 15 % bovine serum . 2 . 6 Generation of the 3D skin model The iPSC - KCs and iPSC - FBs were assembled together on the culture patch to form the 3D skin mod - el . First , the culture patch was coated with Matrigel® hesc - qualified matrix for 24 h at 37 ℃ . The iPSC - FBs were attached on the patch on the back side and incu - bated at 37 ℃ . After 2 days , the patch was turned over and coated with the Matrigel® hesc - qualified matrix . The iPSC - KCs were seeded on the front side of the patch , and the cells were seeded at a density of 1×10 6 cells / mL . Then , the cells were further cultured on the culture patch for another 15 days in the potable analyt - ical system obtained from Mesobiosystems Ltd . The CnT - 07 medium and DMEM were supplemented with 15 % bovine serum and were used to culture the iP - SC - KCs and iPSC - FBs , respectively . The ﬂow rate was set to 10 μL / mL . 2 . 7 RT - PCR RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit 1274 Vol . 37 No . 6 LUO Zhang et al : Integrated Organ - on - a - chip with Human - induced Pluripot . . . ( Qiagen ) , and DNA was removed by DNase treatment ( Invitrogen ) to avoid genomic DNA amplification . cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg RNA by SuperScrip - tIII reverse transcriptase and Oligo - dT primers ( Invi - trogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . PCR was performed with a 30 - μL mixture containing 2 μL cDNA , 0 . 2 - μM concentration of primers , and 15 μL 2×A8 FastHiFi PCR Master Mix ( Aidlab Biotechnolo - gies Co . , Ltd . , China ) . The mixture was subjected to 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 ℃ for denaturation , 30 s at 55 ℃ for annealing , and 30 s at 72 ℃ for extension . The PCR primers are listed in Table S1 . 2 . 8 Immunofluorescence For immunostaining , samples including the iPSCs , iPSC - derived keratinocytes , iPSC - derived fi - broblasts , and 3D skin models were rinsed with PBS to remove unattached cells . The remaining cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) / PBS for 15 min . Then , the iPSCs were treated for permeabiliza - tion with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 / PBS while other samples were treated with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 / PBS for 15 min at room temperature . Next , all samples were blocked by 3 % v / v bovine serum albumin and 10 % goat serum for 1 h at room temperature ( RT ) to block out nonspecific binding and incubated with primary antibodies over - night at 4 ℃ . After 3 rinses with PBS , the appropriate secondary antibodies were added for 1 h at RT . Nuclei staining was performed with 1 μg / mL Hoechst / PBS for 20 min . The confocal microscopy ( Leica TCS SP8 , Germany ) was used to visualize and capture the immu - nostained samples with a good resolution . All antibod - ies are shown in Table S2 . 3 Results and discussion 3 . 1 Culture patch description The culture patch was composed of PLGA nano - fibers electrospun on a PEGDA microframe that had a poroid structure 200 μm in diameter and with a 250 - μm distance from the centers of the circles ( Fig . 1 ) . A PEGDA ring , with a thickness of 100 μm and an inner and outer diameter of 8 and 13 μm , respective - ly , was mounted on the frame for easier handling and manipulation . The PLGA nanofibers formed a net - like structure with pore sizes less than 8 μm ( Fig . 1 ( c ) and Fig . 1 ( d ) ) as measured by a Nano Measurer . On such a net - like structure , the cells could be cultured with the minimum of exogenous material contact and the maxi - mum exposure to the culture medium . Furthermore , the culture patch had a similar material density to that of the culture medium , allowing for an off - ground culture using or without using special handling devices .

( f ) RT - PCR analyses of the iPSC - derived keratinocytes . Several pluripotent markers ( SOX2 , OCT4 , NANOG , and CMYC ) were observed in the iPSCs before differentiation . Keratinocyte markers ( KRT5 and KRT14 ) were expressed in iPSC - derived keratinocytes as well as Hacat , but not in the iPSCs before direct differentiation 3 . 2 Efficient and reproducible differentia - tion of the iPSCs into keratinocytes and fibroblasts Keratinocyte differentiation and fibroblast differ - entiation of the iPSCs could be achieved by monolayer colonies and embryoid bodies ( EBs ) . We followed previous keratinocyte differentiation protocols by using the defined keratinocyte serum - free medium ( DKSFM ) supplemented with retinoic acid ( RA ) to promote the ectodermal fate [ 23 ] and cause the bone morphogenetic protein 4 ( BMP4 ) to block the neural fate [ 24 ] for 6 days . The medium with a complete DKSFM without RA and BMP4 and a complete CNT - 07 medium were replaced at the time points T1 and T2 ( Fig . 2 ( a ) ) , respectively . Small clumps of the iPSCs were sub - cultured on the Matrigel matrix ( BD Biosciences ) in the PSCeasy TM human pluripotent stem cell ( ES / iPS ) medium on day 0 and iPSCs - derived keratinocytes ( iPSC - KCs ) gener - ated on day 29 ( Fig . 2 ( b ) ) . A differentiation protocol to generate dermal fibroblasts from iPSCs was developed in vitro [ 25 ] by using the AggreWell™ Medium supple - mented with ascorbic acid ( AA ) , which could induce the mesodermal differentiation of ESCs and increase collagen synthesis [ 26 ] and transforming growth factor β2 ( TGFβ2 ) , which has been reported to enhance the mesodermal differentiation from stem cells [ 27 ] and col - lagen production in somatic cells ; it is also involved in the epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition in several contexts [ 28 ] . After 4 days of induction , the medium with DMEM containing FBS and AA was replaced , which was then replaced by DMEM with FBS at time point 1276 Vol . 37 No . 6 LUO Zhang et al : Integrated Organ - on - a - chip with Human - induced Pluripot . . . T2 ( Fig . 3 ( a ) ) . EBs were generated in the AggreWell™ medium on day 0 , and the iPSCs - derived fibroblasts ( iPSC - FBs ) were obtained after several passages ( Fig . 3 ( b ) ) . The iPSC - KCs and iPSC - FBs were detached and caught by the Matrigel - coated culture patch , and the cells on the culture patch grew along the PLGA nanofi - bers . The distributions of the iPSC - KCs and iPSC - FBs were further demonstrated by SEM images ( Figs . 2 ( c ) and 3 ( c ) ) . The characteristics of iPSC - derived cells were further examined by immunostaining and RT - PCR . We found that a large number of cells expressed type VII collagen ( ColVII ) , keratin 14 ( KRT14 ) , p63 , des - moglein 3 ( DSG3 ) , and keratin 1 ( KRT1 ) , indicating that these iPSC - derived cells closely resemble normal human keratinocytes ( Fig . 2 ( d ) ) . Moreover , the trans - gene expression in the iPSC - KCs , including SOX2 , OCT4 , NANOG , CMYC , was silent relative to that in the original iPSC , while the expressions of KRT5 and KRT14 were detected in both the iPSC - derived keratinocytes and Hacat , which also expressed OCT4 , NANOG , and SOX2 ( Fig . 2 ( e ) ) . We next examined the characteristics of the iPSC - derived cells to define the fibroblast - like properties . Fig . 3 ( d ) shows vimentin Fig . 4 Microengineered skin - on - a - chip .

In addition , the expression of several mark - ers indicative of mesodermal and fibroblast induction increased ( CD73 , ColI , and ColIII ) , while stem cell markers , SOX2 , OCT4 , NANOG , and CMYC , were completely missing in the iPSC - derived fibroblasts , as well as human epidermal fibroblasts ( HEFs ) ( Fig . 3 ( e ) ) . Therefore , the results showed that iPSCs were success - fully differentiated into keratinocytes and fibroblasts , and the iPSC - derived cells were used to construct the human epidermal model . 3 . 3 Cell culture in the human skin - on - a - chip device The stability of the proposed culture patch ( Fig . 4 ( b ) ) , which was made up of PLGA nanofibers electrospun on a PEGDA microframe , was tested . We next generated the in vitro 3D skin model by seeding a sufficient number of iPSC - KCs and iPSC - FBs on the front and back sides of the cell culture , respectively . The magnet - based bonding between the culture patch and polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) channels enabled up to 10 days of cell culture without leakage . The volume of the top and bottom chambers was approximately 100 μL ( Figs . 4 ( c ) - 4 ( e ) ) . To investigate the formation of the 3D skin model in the skin - on - a - chip platform after 10 days of co - culturing , the iPSC - KCs and iPSC - FBs were stained with KRT1 ( green ) and VIM ( red ) respec - tively , and the results are shown in Figs . 5 ( b ) - 5 ( c ) . The 3D fluorescence images ( Figs . 5 ( e ) - 5 ( f ) ) of attacked cells on the culture patch ( Fig . 5 ( d ) ) indicated that both the iPSC - KCs and iPSC - FBs were cultured uniformly over the culture patch , forming a layered structure . The iPSC - KCs formed a multilayered epidermis on a der - mis consisting of iPSC - FBs ( Fig . 6 ) , which supports the conjecture that iPSCs have the ability to independently provide a full - thickness artificial skin that contains both an epidermis and a dermis . 4 Conclusions In this study , we constructed a miniature model of human skin derived from iPSCs in a skin - on - a - chip device consisting of epidermal and dermal layers . Skin constructs have a homogeneous structure , and lack skin appendages and a vascular system . iPSCs may address these limitations by their pluripotency and self - renewal features . They were successfully directly differentiated into keratinocytes and fibroblasts . Specific proteins and genes were detected after differentiation . The PLGA spinning density was optimized for the cell culture and observation ; after 10 days of being cultured in a skin - on - a - chip , the 3D skin model was generated . The proposed approach could potentially be used in clinical applications , as well as in the cosmetic and pharmaceu - tical industries . References [ 1 ] Shevchenko RV , James SL , James SE .
