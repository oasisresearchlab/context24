Received : 20 April 2012 ; in revised form : 13 June 2012 / Accepted : 21 June 2012 / Published : 28 June 2012 Abstract : ErbB2 is an important oncogenic protein involved in carcinogenesis of , among others , breast , gastric , and ovarian carcinoma . Over - expression of ErbB2 is found in almost 20 % of breast cancers , and this results in proliferative and anti - apoptotic signalling . ErbB2 is therefore an important treatment target . Antibodies recognizing full - length ErbB2 are clinically established , and drugs targeting the ErbB2 stabilizing heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) are under clinical evaluation . We have investigated effects of the ErbB2 - binding antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab alone and in combination , as well as the effect of the antibodies in combination with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17 - AAG . Our results confirm the notion that combination of different ErbB2 - binding antibodies more efficiently down - regulates ErbB2 than does one antibody in isolation . Additionally , our data demonstrate that ErbB2 is most efficiently down - regulated upon incubation with anti - ErbB2 antibodies in combination with Hsp90 inhibitors . The combination of anti - ErbB2 antibodies , and especially the combination of antibodies with 17 - AAG , did also increase the inhibition of Akt activation of either agent , which could suggest an anti - proliferative effect . In such OPEN ACCESS Pharmaceuticals 2012 , 5 675 case , combining these agents could be beneficial in treatment of tumors not responding to trastuzumab only .

Introduction ErbB2 / HER2 is a member of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) family of receptor tyrosine kinases . Eleven ligands have so far been demonstrated to interact with EGFR , ErbB3 and ErbB4 [ 1 , 2 ] , but ErbB2 lacks the capacity to bind ligands and is instead activated through heterodimerization with other ErbB proteins [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] . Importantly , however , ErbB2 is the preferred dimerization partner for the other ErbB proteins [ 5 ] . ErbB2 is endocytosis deficient [ 6 , 7 ] , and we have previously demonstrated that ErbB2 negatively impacts on EGFR down - regulation [ 8 ] . ErbB2 is stabilized by the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) [ 9 , 10 ] , and incubation with Hsp90 inhibitors , such as the ansamycin geldanamycin ( GA ) , induces down - regulation of ErbB2 both in cells expressing ErbB2 only and in cells expressing ErbB2 and other ErbB proteins . We have previously demonstrated that GA - induced down - regulation of ErbB2 was more efficient when cells expressed ErbB2 in combination with other ErbB proteins [ 11 , 12 ] . Hsp90 has , in addition to ErbB2 , a number of other client proteins , including Akt , that control cell growth [ 10 , 13 , 14 ] , and GA - derivatives such as 17 - allylamino - 17 - demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17 - AAG ) are currently in development for cancer treatment [ 15 ] . ErbB2 is overexpressed in a number of human cancers , and humanized anti - ErbB2 monoclonal antibodies are important therapeutic agents in several malignant diseases . Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to a membrane - proximal domain of ErbB2 [ 16 ] . Trastuzumab has clinical effects , even though its mechanism of action is still not completely understood . Although trastuzumab as single agent has been proved active and well tolerated in treatment of breast cancer with ErbB2 overexpression [ 17 ] , many tumors overexpressing ErbB2 do not respond to trastuzumab monotherapy , and acquired resistance does often develop [ 18 , 19 ] . In vitro studies have , however , demonstrated that a combination of trastuzumab and 17 - AAG led to enhanced down - regulation due to lysosomal degradation of ErbB2 in ErbB2 - overexpressing breast cancer cell lines [ 20 ] . The anti - ErbB2 antibody pertuzumab was demonstrated to bind the dimerization arm of ErbB2 and to thereby block ErbB2 dimerization and downstream tumorigenic signaling [ 21 , 22 ] . We have previously demonstrated that pertuzumab efficiently counteracted EGFR - ErbB2 dimerization and thereby facilitated ligand - induced down - regulation of the EGFR [ 23 ] . Recent studies have confirmed beneficial effects of combining trastuzumab and pertuzumab [ 24 – 28 ] . Incubation with antibodies to ErbB2 or to EGFR induces receptor down - regulation with varying efficiency , but combination of Pharmaceuticals 2012 , 5 676 antibodies recognizing different epitopes has turned out to be more efficient [ 29 – 31 ] . The added effect has been explained both by increased endocytosis due to efficient cross - linking of receptors at the plasma membrane [ 30 ] , and by inhibition of recycling from endosomal compartments [ 31 ] . The combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab has also been shown to synergistically inhibit cell survival , in part by inhibited activation of Akt [ 32 ] . We have in the current work compared the effect of pertuzumab and trastuzumab alone or in combination with or without 17 - AAG . Our results support the notion that the combination of pertuzumab , trastuzumab and 17 - AAG increases the inhibitory effect on Akt activation of each of the agents , and induces the most efficient down - regulation of ErbB2 from the plasma membrane , leading to lysosomal degradation of ErbB2 . 2 .

Results and Discussion 3 . 1 . Combination of the Antibodies Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab Induced a Small Cell Type Dependent Down - Regulation of ErbB2 Different results have been reported with respect to antibody - induced endocytosis of ErbB2 [ 30 , 34 ] . We therefore initially investigated the effect of trastuzumab or pertuzumab alone and then the effect of the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab by confocal microscopy analysis and by flow cytometry . For the confocal microscopy studies , we used PAE cells , which do not express endogenous ErbB proteins , but were stably transfected with ErbB2 ( PAE . ErbB2 cells ) [ 8 ] . The cells were Pharmaceuticals 2012 , 5 678 incubated without antibodies , with trastuzumab only , with pertuzumab only or with the combination of both antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C . By confocal microscopy , we then observed partial colocalization of human IgG and early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) in cells incubated with pertuzumab only and also in cells incubated with trastuzumab only . This suggests that a small fraction of the antibody - ErbB2 complexes was internalized ( Figure 1 , middle panels ) . Upon incubation with pertuzumab and trastuzumab in combination , we observed an increase in both the intensity and the number of IgG - positive vesicles ( Figure 1 , lower panel ) . Staining for ErbB2 upon fixation , using a mouse anti - ErbB2 antibody , confirmed that ErbB2 was restricted to the plasma membrane in cells not incubated with antibodies ( Figure 1 , upper panel ) , but colocalized with pertuzumab and trastuzumab in EEA1 positive endosomes upon incubation with both antibodies ( Figure 1 , lower panel ) . To obtain more quantitative results , we measured the amount of ErbB2 at the plasma membrane using flow cytometry , and further to investigate whether the presence of other ErbB proteins affected antibody - induced endocytosis of ErbB2 , we in addition to PAE . ErbB2 cells , used PAE cells expressing both ErbB2 and ErbB3 ( PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 cells ) , and SKOv3 cells . Cells were incubated with trastuzumab or pertuzumab separately or in combination for 24 h at 37 °C . In PAE . ErbB2 cells ( Figure 2A ) the amount of ErbB2 at the plasma membrane was slightly down - regulated upon treatment with pertuzumab or trastuzumab only , whereas in PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 cells ( Figure 2B ) , the single antibodies had no significant down - regulatory effect . While the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab had minor additive effects on ErbB2 down - regulation in PAE . ErbB2 cells ( Figure 2A ) , it caused a significantly increased down - regulation of ErbB2 in PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 cells ( Figure 2B ) . In line with our previously reported data [ 7 ] , our current results demonstrate that trastuzumab did not induce down - regulation of ErbB2 in SKOv3 cells . Also , no effect was observed when these cells were incubated with pertuzumab only or with the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab ( Figure 2C ) . The explanation for the different efficiency of down - regulation in either of the two PAE cell lines and the SKOv3 cells is unclear , but could suggest that different cell lines respond differently to incubation with anti - ErbB2 antibodies . Differences in efficiency may be explained by different density of receptors at the cell surface . Based on previous [ 12 ] and current flow cytometry data , PAE . ErbB2 cells express roughly 10 times more ErbB2 compared to PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 cells . Antibody - induced down - regulation of ErbB2 has been explained by antibody - induced clustering of receptors at the plasma membrane , and the increased effect of combining antibodies recognizing different epitopes was explained by the generation of larger antibody - ErbB2 complexes [ 30 ] . The extent of antibody - induced cross - linking will most likely depend on receptor density . While incubation with one antibody could possibly induce sufficient cross - linking in PAE . ErbB2 cells expressing a high amount of ErbB2 , a combination of different antibodies would probably be required to obtain sufficient cross - linking and endocytosis in cells expressing small amounts of ErbB2 , such as PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 cells . The differences observed when comparing PAE . ErbB2 cells with PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 cells and SKOv3 cells could also suggest that the expression of other ErbB proteins has effect on antibody - induced down - regulation of ErbB2 . Although we have previously demonstrated that pertuzumab inhibits ErbB2 dimerization [ 23 ] , the extent of antibody induced ErbB cross - linking may be limited by the presence of preformed ErbB2 - containing heterodimers . The availability of ErbB2 to added antibodies could also depend on geometry . In fully differentiated cells ErbB proteins are normally expressed at the basolateral side , and this location may be perturbed Pharmaceuticals 2012 , 5 679 to varying extent in dedifferentiated cells . Such cell differences could explain some of the previously reported contradictory results with respect to effect of trastuzumab on ErbB2 down - regulation [ 34 ] . Figure 1 . The combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab enhances antibody - induced endocytosis of ErbB2 . PAE . ErbB2 cells were incubated without antibodies ( Control ) , or with pertuzumab only , trastuzumab only , or pertuzumab and trastuzumab in combination for 1 h at 37 °C . The cells were fixed , permeabilized , and immunostained . Cells not incubated with antibodies ( Control ) were stained using mouse anti - ErbB2 , and goat anti - EEA1 antibodies followed by Rhodamine - conjugated donkey anti - mouse , and Alexa647 - conjugated donkey anti - goat antibodies . Cells treated with pertuzumab or trastuzumab only were stained using Cy2 - conjugated donkey anti - human and goat anti - EEA1 antibodies followed by Alexa647 - conjugated donkey anti - goat antibodies . Cells treated with pertuzumab and trastuzumab in combination were stained using Cy2 - conjugated donkey anti - human , mouse anti - ErbB2 , and goat anti - EEA1 antibodies followed by Rhodamine - conjugated donkey anti - mouse and Alexa647 - conjugated donkey anti - goat antibodies . The cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy . Both pertuzumab and trastuzumab are observed in EEA1 positive early endosomes ( middle panels , white dots ) . In cells treated with pertuzumab and trastuzumab , ErbB2 colocalizes with the antibodies in EEA1 positive early endosomes , confirming that ErbB2 was endocytosed ( lower panel , white dots ) . The figure shows one representative experiment out of three independent experiments . Bar , 10 µm . Pharmaceuticals 2012 , 5 680 Figure 2 . Pertuzumab and trastuzumab have an additive effect on down - regulation of ErbB2 from the plasma membrane in cells expressing ErbB2 and ErbB3 only . PAE . ErbB2 ( A ) , PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 ( B ) and SKOv3 ( C ) cells were incubated without antibodies ( Control ) , or with pertuzumab ( 25 µg / mL ) , trastuzumab ( 21 µg / mL ) , or pertuzumab and trastuzumab for 24 h at 37 °C . The cells were fixed and immunostained using mouse anti - ErbB2 antibody followed by APC - conjugated goat anti - mouse antibody before the amount of ErbB2 at the plasma membrane was measured by flow cytometry . 3 . 2 . Both Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab Increase 17 - AAG - Induced Down - Regulation of ErbB2 It is well established that incubation with Hsp90 inhibitors , such as GA and its derivative 17 - AAG , induces endocytosis and degradation of ErbB2 [ 11 , 12 ] , and previous studies have shown that trastuzumab enhances the effect of 17 - AAG on ErbB2 [ 20 , 35 ] . To compare the down - regulatory effect of the antibodies and 17 - AAG , PAE . ErbB2 cells were incubated with 3 µM 17 - AAG alone , with 17 - AAG together with pertuzumab or trastuzumab , or with 17 - AAG and both antibodies . Confocal microscopy analysis confirmed that incubation with 17 - AAG for 1 h at 37 °C induced endocytosis of ErbB2 ( Figure 3 , upper panel ) . When cells were incubated with either of the antibodies in combination with 17 - AAG , labeling for human IgG showed a vesicular staining that appeared more intense compared to when cells were incubated with antibodies only ( compare middle panels in Figure 3 with middle Pharmaceuticals 2012 , 5 681 panels in Figure 1 ) . The number of IgG positive vesicles and the intensity of the vesicular staining did , however , further increase when the cells were incubated with 17 - AGG and the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab ( Figure 3 , lower panel ) . Figure 3 . Incubation with either pertuzumab or trastuzumab , or with their combination increases 17 - AAG - induced endocytosis of ErbB2 . PAE . ErbB2 cells were incubated with 17 - AAG ( 3 µM ) only ( Control ) , or with 17 - AAG together with either pertuzumab ( 25 µg / mL ) , trastuzumab ( 21 µg / mL ) , or pertuzumab and trastuzumab in combination for 1 h at 37 °C . Cells treated with 17 - AAG only were stained using mouse anti - ErbB2 and goat anti - EEA1 antibodies followed by rhodamine - conjugated donkey anti - mouse and Alexa647 - conjugated donkey anti - goat antibodies . Cells incubated with 17 - AAG and pertuzumab or with 17 - AAG and trastuzumab only were stained using Cy2 - conjugated donkey anti - human and goat anti - EEA1 antibodies followed by Alexa647 - conjugated donkey anti - goat . Cells incubated with 17 - AAG , pertuzumab , and trastuzumab in combination were stained using Cy2 - conjugated donkey anti - human , mouse anti - ErbB2 , and goat anti - EEA1 antibodies followed by Rhodamine - conjugated donkey anti - mouse and Alexa647 - conjugated donkey anti - goat antibodies . The cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy . Endocytosed IgGs were observed to colocalize with EEA1 in early endosomes , and internalized ErbB2 was observed to colocalize with EEA1 in early endosomes ( lower panel , white dots ) . The figure shows one representative experiment out of three independent experiments . Bar , 10 µm . Pharmaceuticals 2012 , 5 682 Labeling for ErbB2 verified that the incubation with pertuzumab and trastuzumab in combination strongly increased the effect of 17 - AAG ( compare labeling for ErbB2 in Figure 3 upper and lower panels ) . These results suggest ( as previously demonstrated for trastuzumab ) [ 20 , 35 ] , that also pertuzumab increased the effect of 17 - AAG and that a combined incubation with pertuzumab and trastuzumab has an additive effect . To compare the effects quantitatively , and to compare the effect in different cell lines , we used flow cytometry analysis . PAE . ErbB2 , PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 , and SKOv3 cells were incubated with either pertuzumab or trastuzumab or with both antibodies in the presence of 3 µM 17 - AAG for 24 h at 37 °C . As demonstrated in Figure 4 , the amount of ErbB2 was clearly down - regulated upon incubation with 17 - AAG for 24 h , and in line with our previous data [ 12 ] , the down - regulation of ErbB2 appeared to be stronger in PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 cells ( Figure 4B ) compared to in PAE . ErbB2 cells ( Figure 4A ) . Figure 4 . Incubation with pertuzumab and / or trastuzumab potentiates 17 - AAG - induced down - regulation of ErbB2 from the plasma membrane . PAE . ErbB2 ( A ) , PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 ( B ) and SKOv3 cells ( C ) were incubated with 17 - AAG ( 3 µM ) alone or with 17 - AAG and either pertuzumab ( 25 µg / mL ) , trastuzumab ( 21 µg / mL ) or pertuzumab and trastuzumab for 24 h at 37 °C . The cells were fixed and immunostained using mouse anti - ErbB2 antibody followed by APC - conjugated goat anti - mouse antibody . The amount of ErbB2 at the plasma membrane was measured using flow cytometry . Pharmaceuticals 2012 , 5 683 Both pertuzumab and trastuzumab enhanced the effect of 17 - AAG in all cell lines tested . In PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 and in SKOv3 cells , the two antibodies showed comparable effects , while in PAE . ErbB2 cells pertuzumab had a slightly reduced effect compared to trastuzumab . The combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab together with 17 - AAG appeared to give the most efficient down - regulation even though the effect of adding pertuzumab in addition to trastuzumab seemed limited . 3 . 3 . Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab Potentiate 17 - AAG - Induced Degradation of ErbB2 The confocal microscopy and flow cytometry data demonstrated that incubation with pertuzumab and trastuzumab in combination induced down - regulation of ErbB2 from the plasma membrane more efficiently than did either antibody alone . Also , addition of the antibodies increased the 17 - AAG - induced down - regulation of ErbB2 . Given the probability that ErbB2 can signal also when localized to early endosomes , it is important to know under which conditions ErbB2 is sorted to late endosomes and lysosomes and degraded . Incubation with 17 - AAG normally results in lysosomal degradation of ErbB2 . To investigate to what extent endocytosed ErbB2 was efficiently degraded , PAE . ErbB2 , PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 and SKOv3 cells were incubated with each of the two antibodies alone or in combination in the presence or absence of 17 - AAG for 5 h at 37 °C in the presence of cycloheximide . Incubation with 17 - AAG alone induced degradation of ErbB2 in all cell lines tested ( Figures 5 and 6A ) . 17 - AAG induced degradation of ErbB2 was most prominent in PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 cells . This is in line with our previous results , demonstrating that expression of ErbB3 increases the rate of GA - induced down - regulation of ErbB2 [ 12 ] . Incubation with antibodies alone did not induce detectable degradation of ErbB2 in any of the cell lines even when the two antibodies were combined ( Figures 5 and 6B ) . However , when PAE . ErbB2 and PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 cells were treated with either of the antibodies in combination with 17 - AAG , a substantial amount of ErbB2 was degraded already upon incubation for 5 h . In PAE . ErbB2 cells , this effect was strongest upon incubation with trastuzumab and 17 - AAG ( Figures 5 and 6C ) . However , importantly , in both cell lines , the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab together with 17 - AAG gave the most pronounced effect . In SKOv3 cells , neither trastuzumab , nor pertuzumab alone increased 17 - AAG - induced degradation . However , also in these cells did the combined incubation with trastuzumab and pertuzumab strongly increase 17 - AAG induced degradation of ErbB2 ( Figures 5 and 6C ) . It has previously been shown that the combination of trastuzumab and 17 - AAG induced enhanced ubiquitination , endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of ErbB2 [ 20 ] , and it is possible that pertuzumab has the same effect when combined with 17 - AAG . The strong effect on degradation of ErbB2 when combining pertuzumab , trastuzumab and 17 - AAG in all the cell lines examined was most likely induced by complementary mechanisms including efficient endocytosis due to the formation of large antibody - ErbB2 complexes [ 29 , 30 ] and increased 17 - AAG induced ubiquitination [ 20 ] , as well as inhibition of recycling due to antibody - mediated receptor cross - linking [ 31 ] and ubiquitin - mediated lysosomal sorting of ErbB2 [ 20 ] . Pharmaceuticals 2012 , 5 684 Figure 5 . Incubation with pertuzumab and trastuzumab increases 17 - AAG - induced degradation of ErbB2 . PAE . ErbB2 , PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 and SKOv3 cells were incubated with pertuzumab ( 25 µg / mL ) , trastuzumab ( 21 µg / mL ) and their combination in the presence or absence of 17 - AAG ( 3 µM ) for 5 h at 37 °C in the presence of cycloheximide ( CHX ; 25 µg / mL ) . The cells were lysed and subjected to SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting with rabbit anti - ErbB2 antibody . Immunoblotting for Tubulin was used as loading control . The combination of pertuzumab , trastuzumab and 17 - AAG strongly increased 17 - AAG - induced degradation of ErbB2 in all cell lines tested . 3 . 4 . 17 - AAG Enhances the Inhibitory Effect on Akt Activation Induced by the Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab In addition to endocytosis and degradation of ErbB2 , inhibition of cell growth is an important effect of both anti - ErbB2 antibodies and Hsp90 - inhibitors . The combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab has previously been shown to synergistically inhibit activation of Akt [ 32 ] . Akt is itself an Hsp90 client and will upon incubation with Hsp90 - inhibitors over time be degraded [ 13 ] . Incubation with GA has , however , in addition also been demonstrated to induce a rapid decrease in Akt activity due to increased dephosphorylation of Akt prior to degradation of Akt itself [ 36 ] . To investigate whether the combination of the antibodies with 17 - AAG had an additive inhibitory effect on Akt activation , we therefore incubated cells with each of the two antibodies alone and also in combination with or without 17 - AAG for 1 h at 37 °C . In PAE . ErbB2 cells and SKOv3 cells we observed no significant effects on Akt activity ( data not shown ) . Pharmaceuticals 2012 , 5 685 Figure 6 . Quantification of pertuzumab - , trastuzumab - , and / or 17 - AAG - induced degradation of ErbB2 . The intensity of the bands in the Western blots demonstrated in Figure 5 was measured , and for each condition the intensity for ErbB2 was normalized to tubulin . The calculated values thus reflects the amount of ErbB2 remaining in cells after the various treatments . ( A ) Effect of incubation with 17 - AAG . The relative intensity of ErbB2 in cells treated with CHX only was set to 1 ; ( B ) Effect of incubation with pertuzumab and / or trastuzumab . The relative intensity of ErbB2 in cells treated with CHX only was set to 1 ; ( C ) Effect of incubation with antibodies and 17 - AAG in combination . The relative intensity of ErbB2 in cells treated with 17 - AAG and CHX , but no antibodies , was set to 1 , and the control values do thus correspond to the respective 17 - AAG values in ( A ) . On its own , each agent had minimal effects also in PAE . ErbB2 . ErbB3 cells . However , in these cells the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab induced a strong decrease in Akt phosphorylation , and this effect was further increased when 17 - AAG was added along with the combined antibodies ( Figure 7 ) . These results confirm the beneficial effect of combining several different agents , but also emphasize important cell line dependent differences .
