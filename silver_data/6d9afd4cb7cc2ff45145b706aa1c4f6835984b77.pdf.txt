We consider a coupled incompressible Darcy’s problem whose novelty lies in the coupling in the boundary term of the Hele - Shaw model , with surface tension , with a PDE stated on the free evolving domain , see Section 2 for details . More precisely , we consider a smooth open bounded set Ω 0 in R 2 , representing the portion of the space occupied by an incompressible ﬂuid at time t = 0 , and a given smooth non - negative function c 0 = c 0 ( x , y ) deﬁned on Ω 0 , which represents the concentration of a solute at time t = 0 . Then , we seek a family of open sets Ω ( t ) of R 2 with boundary Γ ( t ) = ∂ Ω ( t ) and concentration functions c ( t , x , y ) deﬁned on Ω ( t ) solutions of − ∆ P = 0 in Ω ( t ) , ( 1 . 1a ) P = γκ + χf ( c ) on Γ ( t ) , ( 1 . 1b ) V n = V Γ ( t ) · n = −∇ P · n on Γ ( t ) , ( 1 . 1c ) ∂ t c − D ∆ c = ( 1 − a ) ∇ P · ∇ c in Ω ( t ) , ( 1 . 1d ) D ∇ c · n = ac ∇ P · n on Γ ( t ) , ( 1 . 1e ) c ( 0 , x , y ) = c 0 ( x , y ) in Ω 0 , ( 1 . 1f ) Ω ( 0 ) = Ω 0 , ( 1 . 1g ) where κ is the curvature ( positive for a circle ) of the evolving free - boundary Γ ( t ) , n is the outward pointing unit normal on Γ ( t ) , the surface tension γ ≥ 0 is a given constant , χ ≥ 0 , D > 0 is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient , a ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] , and f : R → R is a given function . We denote by V Γ ( t ) ( resp . V n ) the velocity ( resp . normal velocity ) of the moving free - boundary Γ ( t ) . The ﬁrst two equations ( 1 . 1a ) – ( 1 . 1b ) determine the pressure according to Darcy’s law , which states that the velocity of the ﬂuid is u = −∇ P , incompressibility of the ﬂuid , that is div u = 0 , and Laplace condition ; the third one ( 1 . 1c ) is a kinematic condition which states that the interface Γ ( t ) is transported by the velocity of the ﬂuid −∇ P . In ( 1 . 1e ) , a zero solute ﬂux ( of c ) on the moving boundary Γ ( t ) is imposed . The coupling with the unknown c occurs in the boundary term ( 1 . 1b ) . The time evolution of c follows the advection - diﬀusion equation ( 1 . 1d ) . We refer to Section 2 for a biological justiﬁcation of the model . Note that in ( 1 . 1 ) , we have formally conservation of molecular content , that is for all time t it holds that M : = Z Ω ( t ) c ( t , x , y ) d x d y = Z Ω 0 c 0 ( x , y ) d x d y . ( 1 . 2 ) For simplicity , here we will assume that D = 1 . 3 We make the following assumptions on f : f ∈ C 1 ( R + ) , f is increasing , f ( 0 ) = 0 , lim x → + ∞ f ( x ) = L . ( 1 . 3 ) Remark 1 . 1 . A prototype example , [ 22 ] , of a function satisfying the previous as - sumptions is f ( x ) = Lx α + x , ( 1 . 4 ) where L > 0 is the maximal pulling force and α > 0 is a satuartion parameter . Let us brieﬂy comment the existing literature concerning ( 1 . 1 ) . Moving interface problems have raised many interesting and challenging mathematical issues . A well known example is the Stefan problem which describes the dynamics of the boundary between ice and water . In the biophysical community , we ﬁnd a large number of free boundary models to describe tumor and tissue growth , cell motility and other phenomena . Most of them are formulated through a ﬂuid approach with surface tension . Some tumor growth models ( e . g . [ 16 , 17 , 18 ] ) resemble our model ( 1 . 1 ) . However , there is an important diﬀerence : tumor growth naturally involves expanding domain while we consider here incompressible solutions . In the context of the motility of eukaryotic cells on substrates , various free boundary problems have been derived and studied , see [ 2 , 28 , 4 , 26 , 5 , 6 , 27 ] . In the 1D setting , Keller - Segel system with free boundaries as a model for contraction driven motility were introduced and studied in [ 31 , 34 , 32 , 33 ] . The models presented in [ 5 , 6 ] show some similarities with our model but the coupling between the bulk equation and the boundary is diﬀerent . The existence of traveling wave solutions for these models is proved in [ 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] . In the context of sharp interface limit some models for cell motility were studied in [ 12 , 13 ] . We refer to [ 36 , 24 ] for a review . 1 . 1 On traveling waves A remarkable feature of cell motility is the appearance of sustained movement in a given direction without external cue , see [ 1 , 36 , 19 ] . This phenomenon , known as spontaneous polarization , see [ 9 , 15 , 29 ] e . g . , is mathematically described by the existence of traveling wave solutions and is the main subject of this article . Traveling wave solutions of ( 1 . 1 ) correspond to a ﬁxed shape domain moving by translation with constant velocity V ∈ R in a given direction u , that is Ω tw ( t ) = e Ω + tV u , ( 1 . 5 ) for some speed V and direction of motion u . Note that the problem is isotropic , so we can assume without loss of generality that u = e x = ( 1 , 0 ) and V > 0 . In that case , the normal boundary velocity of Ω ( t ) given by ( 1 . 5 ) satisﬁes V n = V e x · n . Using the traveling wave ansatz c = c ( x − V t , y ) , P = P ( x − V t , y ) , Ω ( t ) = e Ω + ( V t , 0 ) , a traveling - wave solution of ( 1 . 1 ) is deﬁned as following , see Section 4 . 1 for details . 4 Deﬁnition 1 . 2 . A traveling wave solution of ( 1 . 1 ) is given by a domain e Ω ⊂ R 2 with C 2 , 1 boundary e Γ , a positive real number V and two C ∞ functions P , c deﬁned on e Ω satisfying − ∆ P = 0 in e Ω , ( 1 . 6a ) P = γκ + χf ( c ) on e Γ , ( 1 . 6b ) −∇ P · n = ( V , 0 ) · n on e Γ , ( 1 . 6c ) div ( ( V , 0 ) c + ( 1 − a ) c ∇ P + ∇ c ) = 0 in e Ω , ( 1 . 6d ) ac ( V , 0 ) · n + ∇ c · n = 0 on e Γ . ( 1 . 6e ) We begin by observing that the pressure and the concentration have simple forms . Proposition 1 . 3 . For traveling wave solutions of ( 1 . 1 ) , the functions P and c have the form : P ( x , y ) = p 1 − V x , p 1 ∈ R , and c ( x , y ) = M R e Ω e − aV x ′ d x ′ d y ′ e − aV x , with M ≥ 0 . Remark 1 . 4 ( On traveling waves and Jordan curves ) . The equations in ( 1 . 6 ) man - date that the entire ﬂuid bulk ﬂows at a uniform speed , that is ∇ P = − ( V , 0 ) in e Ω . Traveling wave solutions of ( 1 . 1 ) can be regarded as a family of closed Jordan curves Γ tw ( t ) , which represents the boundary of a domain Ω tw ⊂ R 2 at time t , traveling with constant shape e Γ = ∂ e Ω and velocity V e x ∈ R 2 , i . e . , Γ tw ( t ) = e Γ + tV e x , ( 1 . 7 ) for t ≥ 0 , where e Γ is a Jordan curve that is positively oriented ( counterclockwise direction ) and is governed by the curvature equation ( 1 . 6b ) . In particular , recalling the expressions of P and c in Proposition 1 . 3 , the boundary condition ( 1 . 6b ) takes the form γκ ( x ) = p 1 − V x − χf M R Ω 0 e − aV x ′ d x ′ d y ′ e − aV x ! on e Γ . ( 1 . 8 ) Remark 1 . 5 ( On V and e Ω ) . In this problem , the set e Ω and the speed V must be found together and they depend on χ , p 1 , a , γ and f . The parameter p 1 can be seen as a Lagrange multiplier for the volume of e Ω , but the problem is invariant by translation . Any translation of e Ω leads to a solution of ( 1 . 8 ) , with the same V but a diﬀerent value of p 1 . 1 . 2 Main results We establish the following properties of the model ( 1 . 1 ) in Section 2 : | Ω ( t ) | = | Ω 0 | ∀ t ≥ 0 , ( 1 . 9 ) 5 M ( t ) = M ( 0 ) = M ( 1 . 10 ) u C ( t ) = − χ | Ω 0 | Z Γ ( t ) f ( c ) n d σ , ( 1 . 11 ) where u C ( t ) is the velocity of the center of mass . Let R 0 = r | Ω 0 | π , that is | B R 0 | = | Ω 0 | , where B R 0 is the disk with radius R 0 . Then , problem ( 1 . 1 ) with ( 1 . 9 ) and ( 1 . 10 ) possesses a unique radially symmetric solution with both P and c being constant . Lemma 1 . 6 . Assume that | B R 0 | = | Ω 0 | . The problem ( 1 . 1 ) with ( 1 . 9 ) and ( 1 . 10 ) admits a unique radially symmetric solution ( c , P ) = ( ˜ c , e P ) which has the form (cid:16) ˜ c , e P (cid:17) : = (cid:18) M πR 20 , γ R 0 + χf (cid:18) M πR 20 (cid:19)(cid:19) = (cid:18) ˜ c , γ R 0 + χf ( ˜ c ) (cid:19) . ( 1 . 12 ) We begin performing a linear stability analysis around the radially symmetric solution ( ˜ c , e P ) . Deﬁne χ ∗ : = πR 20 aMf ′ (cid:16) MπR 20 (cid:17) = 1 a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) . ( 1 . 13 ) Proposition 1 . 7 . Assume that χ ∈ ( χ ∗ , ∞ ) , then the linearized problem around ( ˜ c , e P ) associated with ( 1 . 1 ) has at least one eigenvalue with positive real part . On the contrary , if χ ∈ [ 0 , χ ∗ ] , then all the eigenvalues of the linearized problem around ( ˜ c , e P ) associated with ( 1 . 1 ) have non - positive real parts . Then , we wonder when equations ( 1 . 7 ) – ( 1 . 8 ) admit traveling waves . Our ﬁrst partially result states that no traveling wave exists under a well precise condition on the parameters . Proposition 1 . 8 . Assume that the function f in ( 1 . 1 ) veriﬁes ( 1 . 3 ) and aχ s f ′ ( s ) < 1 ∀ s ∈ R + . ( 1 . 14 ) There does not exist any traveling wave solution to ( 1 . 1 ) in the sense of Deﬁnition 1 . 2 . It is the goal of this paper to prove the existence of non - trivial traveling wave solutions of ( 1 . 1 ) and thus validate the interest of this model to describe cell motility . For this purpose we use two diﬀerent approaches : constructive by ﬁxing the value of p 1 or based on a bifurcation argument by ﬁxing the area , that is R 0 . Theorem 1 . 9 ( Explicit by construction ) . Assume that f satisﬁes assumptions ( 1 . 3 ) . For all a ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] , γ > 0 and all p 1 > χL , there exists a one parameter 6 family of traveling wave solutions ( e Ω p 1 χ , V p 1 χ ) of ( 1 . 1 ) , parametrized by χ ∈ ( χ ∗ , ∞ ) , such that P is of the form P = p 1 − V x . With this constructive method we obtain conditions under which the set e Ω p 1 χ is convex , see Theorem 5 . 1 in Section 5 for more details . While the proof of this Theorem is constructive , it does not clearly identify what happens for a cell of ﬁxed volume when the value of χ increases . The next result solves this problem . Theorem 1 . 10 ( Implicit by bifurcation ) . Assume that f satisﬁes assumptions ( 1 . 3 ) . For all a ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] , γ > 0 and R 0 > 0 , there exists a one parameter family of traveling wave solutions ( e Ω R 0 χ , V R 0 χ ) of ( 1 . 1 ) , parametrized by χ ∈ ( χ ∗ , ∞ ) such that | e Ω R 0 χ | = πR 20 . With this implicit method we can characterize the nature of the bifurcation , either pitchfork or saddle node , see Theorem 6 . 2 in Section 7 for more details . Remark 1 . 11 . Note that condition ( 1 . 14 ) aχ s f ′ ( s ) < 1 ∀ s ∈ R + , in Proposition 1 . 8 , and condition χ ∈ ( χ ∗ , ∞ ) , that is aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) ≥ 1 in Proposition 1 . 7 , Theorems 1 . 9 and 1 . 10 cannot hold at the same time . This work is organized as follows . We give some biological justiﬁcation and we present some properties of the problem ( 1 . 1 ) in Section 2 . In Section 3 , we study the linear stability of the system and we prove Proposition 1 . 7 . Sections 4 and 5 contain , respectively , the proofs of Proposition 1 . 8 and Theorem 1 . 9 . Theorem 1 . 10 is proved in Section 6 and in Section 7 we discuss the nature of the bifurcation . Finally , we give some conclusions . We also provide the reader with three appendices , collecting some useful facts and bifurcation results . 2 Biological justiﬁcation and ﬁrst properties of the problem ( 1 . 1 ) In this section we justify , from a biological point of view , the interest of ( 1 . 1 ) and we derive some properties of the coupled free boundary problem ( 1 . 1 ) . We proceed formally ( considering smooth enough solutions ) and deduce the conservation of the area , the marker content as well as a law for the velocity of the center of mass . We also discuss the existence and uniqueness of a radially symmetric solution to ( 1 . 1 ) . 7 2 . 1 Biological justiﬁcation Cell motility at the single cell level is a prime example of self - propulsion and one of the simplest example of active system . Recently , many free boundary models have been proposed to describe cell motility ( see [ 36 ] for a review ) . The model ( 1 . 1 ) , ﬁrst introduced in [ 22 ] , is a minimal hydrodynamic model of polarization , migration and deformation of a living cell conﬁned between two parallel surfaces . In this model , the cell cytoplasm is an out of equilibrium system thanks to the active forces generated in the cytoskeleton . The cytoplasm is described as a passive viscous droplet in the Hele - Shaw ﬂow regime . It contains a dilute solution which controls the active force induced by the cytoskeleton . Although relatively simple , this two - dimensional model predicts a very rich range of dynamic behaviors , see [ 22 ] . More precisely , in ( 1 . 1a ) – ( 1 . 1c ) a Hele - Shaw cell is considered , that is a ﬂuid droplet of constant viscosity is conﬁned between two parallel plates separated by a gap . In such a case if u denotes the gap - averaged planar ﬂow and P = P ( t , x , y ) is the ﬂuid pressure , we let u = −∇ P and rewrite equation ( 1 . 1a ) – ( 1 . 1c ) as u + ∇ P = 0 in Ω ( t ) , ∇ · u = 0 in Ω ( t ) , P − χf ( c ) = γκ on Γ ( t ) , V n = V Γ ( t ) · n = u · n on Γ ( t ) Ω ( t = 0 ) = Ω 0 . Note that u averages the parabolic Hele - Shaw ﬂow proﬁle , which approximates the solution to the Stokes momentum - balance equation in thin ﬁlms . As anticipated , the novelty of this model lies in the normal force balance on the boundary Γ ( t ) . The classical Young - Laplace condition is perturbed by an active traction force , − χf ( c ) n . This force is deﬁned per unit length and is controlled locally by the gap - integrated concentration of an internal solute , c = c ( t , x , y ) . We stress that f ( c ) can be either negative ( pushing outwards ) or positive ( pulling inwards ) . In this regard , any uniform term f 0 ∈ R added to f ( c ) would merely oﬀset the pressure P by a constant and thus be irrelevant to the dynamics . The last boundary condition is the kinematic condition , stating that the normal velocity of the sharp interface , V n , is given by the normal velocity of the ﬂuid on Γ ( t ) . To close the system , the internal solute transport problem is formulated in ( 1 . 1d ) – ( 1 . 1e ) . In the bulk Ω ( t ) , fast adsorption on the top and bottom plates ( or onto an adhered cortex ) is assumed . With rapid on and oﬀ rates , the quasi - 2D transport dynamics are given by ( 1 . 1d ) – ( 1 . 1e ) where a is the steady fraction of adsorbed molecules not convected by the average ﬂow and the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient is assumed to be 1 , see [ 22 ] for more details . In ( 1 . 1e ) , a zero solute ﬂux on the moving boundary Γ ( t ) is imposed . Simply put , the solute is eﬀectively convected at a slower velocity than that of the ﬂuid . Hence , its concentration decreases ( increases ) towards an advancing ( retracting ) front . Finally the solute can be any cytoplasmic protein controlling the active force - 8 generation / adhesion machinery . In this model , it is assumed that the concentration c either induces an inwards pulling force or inhibits an outwards pushing force . This means that f is assumed to satisfy f ′ ( c ) > 0 for any c > 0 . 2 . 2 Area preservation Using the ﬂuid volume conservation , imposed by incompressibility ( 1 . 1a ) and kine - matic condition ( 1 . 1c ) , we deduce that d d t | Ω ( t ) | = Z Γ ( t ) V n d σ = − Z Γ ( t ) ∇ P · n d σ = − Z Ω ( t ) ∆ P d x d y = 0 , where d σ denotes the inﬁnitesimal length element of Γ ( t ) . Hence , any smooth solu - tion of ( 1 . 1 ) is area preserving : | Ω ( t ) | = | Ω 0 | ∀ t ≥ 0 . ( 2 . 1 ) 2 . 3 Conservation of the marker content Let M ( t ) denote the mass of molecular content : M ( t ) = Z Ω ( t ) c ( t , x , y ) d x d y . Thanks to the boundary condition ( 1 . 1e ) and to the kinematic condition ( 1 . 1c ) , we have d d tM ( t ) = Z Γ ( t ) cV n d σ + Z Ω ( t ) ∂ t c d x d y = − Z Γ ( t ) D ∇ c · n d σ + Z Ω ( t ) D ∆ c d x d y = 0 . Thus , in ( 1 . 1 ) , we have formally conservation of molecular content : M ( t ) = M ( 0 ) = M . ( 2 . 2 ) 2 . 4 Velocity of the center of mass For each t > 0 , we deﬁne the momentum M Ω ( t ) of Ω ( t ) by M Ω ( t ) = Z Ω ( t ) ( x , y ) d x d y = Z Ω ( t ) z d z , where z = ( x , y ) is the vector coordinate of a point in Ω ( t ) . In particular , M Ω ( t ) is a vector containing the x and y - momentum . The center of mass C Ω ( t ) of Ω ( t ) is deﬁned by C Ω ( t ) = M Ω ( t ) | Ω ( t ) | = 1 | Ω 0 | Z Ω ( t ) ( x , y ) d x d y , 9 by using the area preservation ( 2 . 1 ) . The velocity u C ( t ) of the center of mass C Ω ( t ) is u C ( t ) = d d t C Ω ( t ) . ( 2 . 3 ) From the incompressibility ( 1 . 1a ) and the boundary condition ( 1 . 1b ) , we deduce that d d t Z Ω ( t ) x d x d y = Z ∂ Ω ( t ) xV d σ = − Z ∂ Ω ( t ) x ∇ P · n d σ = − Z Ω ( t ) div ( x ∇ P ) d x d y = − Z Ω ( t ) ∇ P · ∇ x d x d y = − Z Ω ( t ) div ( P ∇ x ) d x d y = − Z ∂ Ω ( t ) P ∇ x · n d σ = − Z ∂ Ω ( t ) ( γκ + χf ( c ) ) n x d σ and similarly d d t Z Ω ( t ) y d x d y = − Z ∂ Ω ( t ) ( γκ + + χf ( c ) ) n y d σ Using that R ∂ Ω ( t ) κn d σ = 0 , it follows that u C ( t ) = − χ | Ω 0 | Z Γ ( t ) f ( c ) n d σ . ( 2 . 4 ) Remark 2 . 1 . We recognize that ( 2 . 4 ) represents the external force balance on the droplet Ω ( t ) . 2 . 5 Stationary solution Proof of Lemma 1 . 6 . Equations ( 1 . 1a ) and ( 1 . 1c ) imply that any stationary so - lution to ( 1 . 1 ) with ( 2 . 2 ) satisﬁes − ∆ P = 0 in Ω 0 , ∇ P · n = 0 on ∂ Ω 0 , hence ∇ P = 0 in Ω 0 . Consequently , ( 1 . 1d ) and ( 1 . 1e ) imply that c satisﬁes − ∆ c = 0 in Ω 0 , ∇ c · n = 0 on ∂ Ω 0 , and then ∇ c = 0 in Ω 0 too . From ( 2 . 2 ) , we deduce that ˜ c = MπR 02 , and the expression of P follows from ( 1 . 1b ) . In particular , we deduce that the mean curvature in ( 1 . 1b ) is constant , hence Ω 0 = B R 0 since | Ω 0 | = | B R 0 | by assumption . 10 2 . 6 Competition between the eﬀects of surface tension and the marker Unlike the classical Hele - Shaw equation with surface tension , the perimeter P ( Ω ( t ) ) deﬁned by P ( Ω ( t ) ) = Z ∂ Ω ( t ) d σ is no more a Lyapunov functional for ( 1 . 1 ) . Indeed using a classical computation ( see [ 30 ] ) , we obtain d d t P ( Ω ( t ) ) = Z Γ ( t ) κV n d σ = 1 γ Z Γ ( t ) P ∇ P · n d σ − χ γ Z Γ ( t ) f ( c ) ∇ P · n d σ = − 1 γ Z Ω ( t ) | ∇ P | 2 d x d y + χ aγ Z Γ ( t ) f ( c ) ∇ log c · n d σ . Note that if we consider the case where f ( c ) = ± c , we obtain d d t P ( Ω ( t ) ) = − 1 γ Z Ω ( t ) | ∇ P | 2 d x d y ± χ aγ Z ∂ Ω ( t ) ∇ c · n d σ . Then , the eﬀects of the two terms located in the right side might be opposite and thus the term χaγ R ∂ Ω ( t ) ∇ c · n d σ might be destabilizing . This leads to some interesting behaviors , see [ 22 ] . In this work we are interested in making part of this informal statement rigorous . 3 Linear stability analysis . Proof of Proposition 1 . 7 In this section we perform a linear stability analysis characterizing the steady - state solution ( ˜ c , e P ) given by ( 1 . 12 ) . This analysis shows that a global polarization - translation ( motility ) mode becomes unstable beyond a critical threshold of solute activity χ = χ ∗ , with χ ∗ deﬁned by ( 1 . 13 ) , that we recall now for the convenience of the reader χ ∗ : = πR 2 0 aMf ′ (cid:16) MπR 20 (cid:17) = 1 a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) . Note that the stability analysis only depends on three factors , i . e . a , χ and f ′ ( ˜ c ) . We ﬁrst construct the linearized operator A associated to ( 1 . 1 ) around the circular homogeneous stationary solution ( 1 . 12 ) . Then , we study its spectrum and its eigenvectors . In particular , we prove that χ ≤ χ ∗ is a suﬃcient condition for all eigenvalues of A to be nonpositive . Finally we discuss the well - posedness character of A . 11 3 . 1 The linearized problem We ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of the Dirichlet - to - Neumann operator I on the open disk B R 0 ⊂ R 2 , and then we give the linearized problem associated to ( 1 . 1 ) around the circular homogeneous stationary solution ( ˜ c , e P ) given by ( 1 . 12 ) . Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . For ψ ∈ H 1 ( ∂B R 0 ) , the Dirichlet - to - Neumann operator I is deﬁned by : I [ ψ ] = ∇ q · n , ( 3 . 1 ) where q denotes the harmonic extension of ψ to the disk B R 0 , that is − ∆ q = 0 in B R 0 , q = ψ on ∂B R 0 . By using Fourier series , the Dirichlet - to - Neumann I operator can be deﬁned as the following linear operator : Deﬁnition 3 . 2 . Given ψ : R / 2 π Z → R with Fourier series ψ ( θ ) = a 0 + ∞ X m = 1 a m cos ( mθ ) + b m sin ( mθ ) , we set I ( ψ ) ( θ ) = ∞ X m = 1 m ( a m cos ( mθ ) + b m sin ( mθ ) ) . Indeed , by the Deﬁnition 3 . 1 , we have q ( r , θ ) = X m ≥ 0 a m cos ( mθ ) r m + b m sin ( mθ ) r m for ( r , θ ) ∈ [ 0 , R ] × R / 2 π Z where we discarded solutions that diverge at r = 0 . Hence , the Deﬁnition 3 . 2 follows from ( 3 . 1 ) and ∂ r q ( r , θ ) = X m ≥ 0 mr m − 1 ( a m cos ( mθ ) + b m sin ( mθ ) ) . We take a perturbation of the free boundary of the form r = R 0 + εϕ ( t , θ ) , i . e . Ω ( t ) = { ( x , y ) = ( r cos θ , r sin θ ) ; 0 ≤ r < R 0 + ερ ( t , θ ) } . Lemma 3 . 3 . The linearized problem associated with ( 1 . 1 ) around the radially sym - metric solution ( 1 . 12 ) is d d t (cid:18) ρ c (cid:19) = A (cid:18) ρ c (cid:19) , ( 3 . 2 ) 12 where A is the operator deﬁned on H 3 ( ∂B R 0 ) × H 2 ( B R 0 ) by A : (cid:18) ρ c (cid:19) 7→ I h γR 0 (cid:0) ∂ 2 θθ ρ + ρ (cid:1) − χf ′ ( ˜ c ) c i ∆ c ! , with the boundary condition ∂ r c = − a ˜ c I (cid:20) γ R 0 (cid:0) ∂ 2 θθ ρ + ρ (cid:1) − χf ′ ( ˜ c ) c (cid:21) on ∂B R 0 . ( 3 . 3 ) Proof . We perform a formal expansion of the solution ( P , c ) to ( 1 . 1 ) near the radi - ally symmetric solution ( 1 . 12 ) , ˜ c = MπR 20 , e P = γR 0 + χf (cid:16) MπR 20 (cid:17) : P ( t , r , θ ) = e P + εQ ( t , r , θ ) + O ( ε 2 ) , c ( t , r , θ ) = ˜ c + εS ( t , r , θ ) + O ( ε 2 ) . For θ ∈ ( − π , π ] and t ≥ 0 , we easily ﬁnd that ∆ Q ( t , r , θ ) = 0 if r < R 0 , ∂ t ρ ( t , θ ) = − ∂ r Q ( t , 1 , θ ) , Q ( t , 1 , θ ) = − γ R 0 (cid:0) ∂ 2 θθ ρ ( t , θ ) + ρ ( t , θ ) (cid:1) + χf ′ ( ˜ c ) S ( t , R 0 , θ ) . Firstly , the last formula is obtained by using the general formula for the curva - ture of a curve r = g ( θ ) , κ ( g ) = 2 ( g ′ ( θ ) ) 2 − g ( θ ) g ′′ ( θ ) + g ( θ ) 2 (cid:16) g ( θ ) 2 + ( g ′ ( θ ) ) 2 (cid:17) 3 / 2 , r = g ( θ ) which gives , to the ﬁrst order in ε , κ ( R 0 + ερ ( θ ) ) = 1 R 0 − ε R 20 (cid:0) ∂ 2 θθ ρ ( t , θ ) + ρ ( t , θ ) (cid:1) . The additional term χf ′ ( ˜ c ) S ( t , R 0 , θ ) comes from the linearization of f ( c ) . The second formula follows from the deﬁnition of the normal derivative ∂P ∂n = ∇ P · n = 1 (cid:16) g ( θ ) 2 + ( g ′ ( θ ) ) 2 (cid:17) 1 / 2 (cid:18) g ( θ ) ∂P ∂r − g ′ ( θ ) g ( θ ) ∂P ∂θ (cid:19) along the curve r = g ( θ ) which gives , to the ﬁrst order in ε , ∇ P · n ( R 0 + ερ ( θ ) ) = ∂P ∂r e r − ε R 0 ∂ θ ρ ( t , θ ) ∂P ∂θ e θ , 13 where n ( R 0 + ερ ( θ ) ) is the the unit normal vector to the boundary of { r = R 0 + ερ ( t , θ ) } , ( 3 . 4 ) and e r = (cid:18) cos θ sin θ (cid:19) and e θ = (cid:18) sin θ − cos θ (cid:19) . Furthermore , up to the ﬁrst order in ε , the normal velocity V n ( R 0 + ερ ( θ ) ) to the bound - ary of ( 3 . 4 ) is V n ( R 0 + ερ ( θ ) ) = ε∂ t ρ ( t , θ ) . The linearization of the convection diﬀusion equation ( 1 . 1d ) – ( 1 . 1e ) around ( ˜ c , e P ) is ε∂ t S + ε ( a − 1 ) (cid:16) ∇ e P · ∇ S + ∇ Q · ∇ ˜ c (cid:17) + ε 2 ( a − 1 ) ∇ Q · ∇ S − ε ∆ S + O ( ε 3 ) = 0 . Moreover , since ˜ c and e P are real numbers and neglecting the ε 2 convection term , we obtain the heat equation . A similar computation yields the boundary term , hence for θ ∈ ( − π , π ] and t ≥ 0 , ∂ t S ( t , r , θ ) = ∆ S ( t , r , θ ) if r < R 0 , ∂ r S ( t , R 0 , θ ) = a ˜ c ∂ r Q ( t , R 0 , θ ) . Hence , the result . 3 . 2 Eigenvalue problem for A The eigenvalue problem for A is : A (cid:18) ρ c (cid:19) = λ (cid:18) ρ c (cid:19) . Thanks to the radial symmetry of the problem the spectral analysis of A amounts to perform a Fourier analysis . Lemma 3 . 4 . Given ( ρ , c ) with Fourier series , then ( 3 . 2 ) – ( 3 . 3 ) describes a closed dynamical system for the cosine ( resp . sine ) perturbations . Proof . Let (cid:18) ρ c (cid:19) = X m ∈ N (cid:18) ˆ ρ cm ˆ c cm ( r ) (cid:19) cos ( mθ ) + X m ∈ N (cid:18) ˆ ρ s m ˆ c s m ( r ) (cid:19) sin ( mθ ) , by linearity of the operator A , we see that A (cid:18) ρ c (cid:19) = X m ≥ 0 A m (cid:18) ˆ ρ cm ˆ c cm ( r ) (cid:19) cos ( mθ ) + X m ≥ 0 A m (cid:18) ˆ ρ s m ˆ c s m ( r ) (cid:19) sin ( mθ ) , 14 with A m deﬁned by A m (cid:18) ˆ ρ ˆ c ( r ) (cid:19) = I h − γR 0 ( m 2 − 1 ) ˆ ρ − χf ′ ( ˜ c ) ˆ c ( R 0 ) i (cid:0) ∂ 2 r + r − 1 ∂ r − r − 2 m 2 (cid:1) ˆ c ( r ) ! . ( 3 . 5 ) Furthermore , the boundary condition ( 3 . 3 ) on ∂B R 0 is ∂ r ˆ c ( R 0 ) = − a ˜ c I (cid:20) − γ R 0 ( m 2 − 1 ) ˆ ρ − χf ′ ( ˜ c ) ˆ c ( R 0 ) (cid:21) . Remark 3 . 5 ( On symmetry properties ) . Since the cosine ( resp . sine ) perturbations in the dynamical system ( 3 . 2 ) – ( 3 . 3 ) are independent , by rotating the coordinate system we may consider , without loss of generality , perturbations possessing the reﬂection symmetry with respect to the x - axis . Speciﬁcally we assume symmetry of the initial data , namely domain Ω ( 0 ) and c ( 0 , x , y ) , with respect to x - axis which is preserved for t > 0 according to Lemma 3 . 4 . Let λ ∈ C . Then , the eigenfunctions of A associated to the eigenvalue λ are of the form c ( r , θ ) = X m ≥ 0 ˆ c mλ ( r ) cos ( mθ ) and ρ ( θ ) = X m ≥ 0 ˆ ρ mλ cos ( mθ ) ( ˆ ρ mλ , ˆ c mλ ) satisfying A m (cid:18) ˆ ρ mλ ˆ c mλ (cid:19) = λ (cid:18) ˆ ρ mλ ˆ c mλ (cid:19) , and ∂ r ˆ c mλ ( R 0 ) = − a ˜ c I (cid:20) − γ R 0 ( m 2 − 1 ) ˆ ρ mλ − χf ′ ( ˜ c ) ˆ c mλ ( R 0 ) (cid:21) , where A m is deﬁned by ( 3 . 5 ) . Thanks to the previous remarks , we deduce the following result . For the sake of clarity , we omit the ˆ · and the subscripts mλ when no ambiguity occurs . Lemma 3 . 6 . The problem A m (cid:18) ρ c (cid:19) = λ (cid:18) ρ c (cid:19) , and ∂ r c = − a ˜ c I (cid:20) − γ R 0 ( m 2 − 1 ) ρ − χf ′ ( ˜ c ) c ( R 0 ) (cid:21) , 15 is equivalent to the following one λρ = − ∂ r P on ∂B R 0 , ( 3 . 6a ) − ∆ P = 0 in B R 0 , ( 3 . 6b ) P = γ R 0 ( m 2 − 1 ) ρ + χf ′ ( ˜ c ) c on ∂B R 0 , ( 3 . 6c ) λc = ∆ c in B R 0 , ( 3 . 6d ) ∂ r c = a ˜ c∂ r P on ∂B R 0 . ( 3 . 6e ) 3 . 3 Suﬃcient conditions for the operator A to have all its eigenvalues with non - positive real parts In this paragraph we give a suﬃcient condition on the non - negative parameters a , ˜ c , f ′ ( ˜ c ) and χ so that all the eigenvalues of A have non - positive real parts . To do so , let Q : = c − a ˜ cP with c and P satisfying ( 3 . 6a ) – ( 3 . 6e ) . We see that ∆ Q = λc in B R 0 , ( 3 . 7a ) (cid:18) 1 − χ χ ∗ (cid:19) P = γ R 0 ( m 2 − 1 ) ρ + χf ′ ( ˜ c ) Q on ∂B R 0 , ( 3 . 7b ) ∇ Q · n = 0 on ∂B R 0 . ( 3 . 7c ) We recall that χ ∗ has been deﬁned in ( 1 . 13 ) . Here we prove the following result . Proposition 3 . 7 . Assume 0 ≤ χ χ ∗ ≤ 1 , χ > 0 and m ≥ 1 . Then , all the eigenvalues of A m have non - positive real parts . More precisely , for c and P satisfying ( 3 . 6a ) – ( 3 . 6e ) , then the following equality holds λ Z B R 0 | c | 2 d x d y + a ˜ c ¯ λγ ( m 2 − 1 ) R 0 χf ′ ( ˜ c ) Z ∂B R 0 | ρ | 2 d σ = − a ˜ c (cid:16) 1 − χ χ ∗ (cid:17) χf ′ ( ˜ c ) ) Z B R 0 | ∇ P | 2 d x d y − Z B R 0 | ∇ Q | 2 d x d y . ( 3 . 8 ) Proof . We compute λ Z B R 0 | c | 2 d x d y = Z B R 0 ¯ c ∆ c d x d y = Z B R 0 (cid:0) ¯ Q + a ˜ c ¯ P (cid:1) ∆ Q d x d y 16 = − Z B R 0 | ∇ Q | 2 d x d y + a ˜ c Z B R 0 ¯ P ∆ Q d x d y = − Z B R 0 | ∇ Q | 2 d x d y − a ˜ c Z B R 0 ∇ ¯ P ∇ Q d x d y . Since P is harmonic and using ( 3 . 7b ) together with ( 3 . 6a ) , we deduce that Z B R 0 ∇ ¯ P ∇ Q d x d y = Z B R 0 div (cid:0) Q ∇ ¯ P (cid:1) d x d y = Z ∂B R 0 Q ∇ ¯ P · n d σ = 1 χf ′ ( ˜ c ) Z ∂B R 0 (cid:18)(cid:18) 1 − χ χ ∗ (cid:19) P − γ R 0 ( m 2 − 1 ) ρ (cid:19) ∇ ¯ P · n d σ = ¯ λγ ( m 2 − 1 ) R 0 χf ′ ( ˜ c ) Z ∂B R 0 | ρ | 2 d σ + 1 − χχ ∗ χf ′ ( ˜ c ) Z B R 0 | ∇ P | 2 d x d y , from which the result follows . Remark 3 . 8 . If we have the strict inequality 0 < χχ ∗ < 1 , and if λ = iw , w ∈ R , is an eigenvalue of A m , then we must have w = 0 . Indeed in such a case both sides of ( 3 . 8 ) are equal to zero , hence ∇ P = 0 in B R 0 . Consequently ∆ P = 0 and therefore λ = 0 or c = 0 in B R 0 . But , if c = 0 in B R 0 , then ρ = 0 on ∂B R 0 . Remark 3 . 9 ( On the case f ′ ( ˜ c ) ≤ 0 ) . If we consider the negative case for the function f , i . e . f ′ ( ˜ c ) ≤ 0 , then for any non negative values of a and χ , all the eigenvalues of A have non positive real parts . Let λ m , p be the p - th real positive root of J ′ m , the derivative of the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind of order m , J m , see the Appendix ( A . 8 ) . Then a straightforward computation gives Proposition 3 . 10 . Assume that aχ = 0 , then the spectrum of the operator A is (cid:8) − m ( m 2 − 1 ) , − λ 2 m , p , m ∈ N , p ∈ Z (cid:9) . 3 . 4 Spectrum of A In this part we describe in more details the eigenvalues of A . The techniques de - veloped in this section depend , in part , on expanding solutions of ( 3 . 6a ) – ( 3 . 6e ) in terms of the modiﬁed Bessel functions I m ( x ) . Lemma 3 . 11 . For m ∈ N , the eigenfunctions of A m associated with the eigenvalue λ ∈ C are (cid:18) ρ ( θ ) c ( r , θ ) (cid:19) = (cid:18) ˆ ρ mλ ˆ c mλ I m (cid:0) − rλ 1 / 2 (cid:1) (cid:19) cos ( mθ ) , 17 with 0 < r < R 0 , θ ∈ ( − π , π ] and ( ˆ c mλ , ˆ ρ mλ ) ∈ C 2 solutions of (cid:18) λ + γ R 20 m ( m 2 − 1 ) (cid:19) ˆ ρ mλ = − χf ′ ( ˜ c ) R 0 mI m (cid:16) − R 0 λ 1 / 2 (cid:17) ˆ c mλ , ( 3 . 9 ) √ λ 2 (cid:16) I m − 1 (cid:16) − R 0 λ 1 / 2 (cid:17) + I m + 1 (cid:16) − R 0 λ 1 / 2 (cid:17)(cid:17) ˆ c mλ = λa ˜ c ˆ ρ mλ . ( 3 . 10 ) Proof . In what follows , we only consider solutions that are smooth in r = 0 . Since P satisﬁes the Laplace equation , solutions have following expression : P ( r , θ ) = A mλ r m cos ( mθ ) for 0 < r < R 0 , θ ∈ ( − π , π ] , with A mλ ∈ C . Consider ρ ( θ ) = ˆ ρ mλ cos ( mθ ) , with ˆ ρ mλ ∈ C . Using ( 3 . 6a ) , we get that λ ˆ ρ mλ = − mR m − 1 0 A mλ . Furthermore , for c ( r , θ ) = ˆ c mλ ( r ) cos ( mθ ) , we have that ( 3 . 6c ) reads A mλ R m 0 = γ R 0 ( m 2 − 1 ) ˆ ρ mλ + χf ′ ( ˜ c ) ˆ c mλ ( R 0 ) , so that , λ ˆ ρ mλ = − γ R 20 m ( m 2 − 1 ) ˆ ρ mλ − χmf ′ ( ˜ c ) R 0 ˆ c mλ ( R 0 ) . ( 3 . 11 ) Finally equation ( 3 . 6d ) yields (cid:0) ∂ 2 r + r − 1 ∂ r − r − 2 m 2 (cid:1) ˆ c mλ ( r ) = λ ˆ c mλ ( r ) , r < R 0 , ( 3 . 12 ) and the boundary condition ( 3 . 6e ) gives ∂ r ˆ c mλ ( R 0 ) = − λa ˜ c ˆ ρ mλ . ( 3 . 13 ) The smooth solutions of ( 3 . 12 ) are known and given by ˆ c mλ ( r ) = ˆ c mλ I m (cid:16) − rλ 1 / 2 (cid:17) , r < R 0 , with ˆ c mλ ∈ C and where I m is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind of order m , whose deﬁnition is recalled in ( A . 3 ) and ( A . 5 ) . The result then follows by substituting the expression of ˆ c mλ ( r ) in ( 3 . 11 ) and ( 3 . 13 ) together with the property of the Bessel function I ′ m ( x ) = ( I m − 1 ( x ) + I m + 1 ( x ) ) / 2 . 18 Let H m be the function deﬁned by H m ( z ) = z 1 / 2 I ′ m (cid:16) − R 0 z 1 / 2 (cid:17) (cid:18) z + γ R 20 m ( m 2 − 1 ) (cid:19) + aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) R 0 mzI m (cid:16) − R 0 z 1 / 2 (cid:17) . ( 3 . 14 ) The eigenvalue equation is H m ( z ) = 0 , hence we deduce the spectrum of A m . Lemma 3 . 12 . The spectrum of A m is s p ( A m ) = { λ ∈ C s . t . H m ( λ ) = 0 } . We can now deduce information on the eigenvalues of A . Theorem 3 . 13 . For γ > 0 , the following dichotomy holds . ( i ) If 0 < χ χ ∗ ≤ 1 , then A has zero eigenvalue λ = 0 of multiplicity three , while the other eigen - values have negative real parts . ( ii ) If χ χ ∗ > 1 , then the operator A has a positive eigenvalue λ > 0 . Proof . Recall that the eigenmode v mλ ( r , θ ) is deﬁned by v mλ ( r , θ ) = (cid:18) ˆ ρ mλ ˆ c mλ I m ( − r √ λ ) (cid:19) cos ( mθ ) . ( 3 . 15 ) Proof of ( i ) . Let us start with the m = 0 mode . Substituting m = 0 in ( 3 . 14 ) gives H 0 ( λ ) = λ 3 / 2 2 I 1 ( − R 0 √ λ ) . ( 3 . 16 ) Using ( 3 . 9 ) and ( 3 . 10 ) , we see that λ = 0 is associated to the two following eigen - modes v 1 00 ( r , θ ) = (cid:18) I 0 ( 0 ) 0 (cid:19) = (cid:18) 1 0 (cid:19) and v 2 00 ( r , θ ) = (cid:18) 0 1 (cid:19) . Moreover , rewriting ( 3 . 16 ) as H 0 ( λ ) = − iλ 3 / 2 2 J 1 (cid:16) − iR 0 λ 1 / 2 (cid:17) , we deduce the other roots of H 0 , that is λ 0 k = − x 21 k < 0 , where x 1 k > 0 is the k - th zero of the Bessel function of order 1 , J 1 ( x ) . These real - negative roots , λ 0 k , are associated with the m = 0 diﬀusion mode , given by v 0 k ( r , θ ) = (cid:18) J 0 ( x 1 k r ) 0 (cid:19) , 19 where J 0 is the Bessel function of order 0 . Consider now the m = 1 mode . Using ( 3 . 14 ) it yields to H 1 ( λ ) = λ 3 / 2 I ′ 1 (cid:16) − R 0 λ 1 / 2 (cid:17) + aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) R 0 λI 1 (cid:16) − R 0 λ 1 / 2 (cid:17) . We see that λ = 0 is a root of H 1 and , using ( 3 . 10 ) , it is associated with the eigenmode v 10 ( r , θ ) = (cid:18) 0 1 (cid:19) cos θ . Let us now look for non zero roots of H 1 . Let λ be a positive root of H 1 , then x = −√ λ < 0 satisﬁes xI ′ 1 ( R 0 x ) I 1 ( R 0 x ) − aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) R 0 = 0 . ( 3 . 17 ) Since R 0 xI ′ 1 ( R 0 x ) I 1 ( R 0 x ) = R 0 xI 2 ( R 0 x ) I 1 ( R 0 x ) + 1 , equation ( 3 . 17 ) rewrites as R 0 xI 2 ( R 0 x ) I 1 ( R 0 x ) + 1 − aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) = 0 . ( 3 . 18 ) Recalling next the deﬁnition of the Bessel function I m , I m ( x ) = ∞ X p = 0 1 p ! ( m + p ) ! (cid:16) x 2 (cid:17) m + 2 p , we see that xI 2 ( x ) I 1 ( x ) > 0 if x < 0 , thus from ( 3 . 18 ) , it follows that if 0 < aχf ′ ( ˜ c ) ≤ 1 , there is no positive root of H 1 . Let us next prove that there is no root λ of H 1 that belongs to C \ R . By contradiction , let us assume that z ∈ C \ ( R ∪ i R ) is such that z 2 = λ and is solution of ( 3 . 18 ) . Since ¯ z 2 6 = z 2 and z I 2 ( R 0 z ) I 1 ( R 0 z ) = ¯ z I 2 ( R 0 ¯ z ) I 1 ( R 0 ¯ z ) , we get zI 2 ( R 0 z ) I 1 ( R 0 ¯ z ) − ¯ zI 2 ( R 0 ¯ z ) I 1 ( R 0 z ) = 0 . Using equality ( A . 7 ) , this leads to z 2 = ¯ z 2 hence a contradiction . From the two previous arguments we deduce that the only non - zero roots of H 1 are real and non positive . 20 Consider now the m ≥ 2 mode . Using ( 3 . 14 ) , it rewrites as H m ( λ ) = λ 1 / 2 I ′ m (cid:16) − R 0 λ 1 / 2 (cid:17) (cid:18) λ + γ R 20 m ( m 2 − 1 ) (cid:19) + aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) R 0 mλI m (cid:16) − R 0 λ 1 / 2 (cid:17) . We see that λ = 0 is a root of H m . In such a case , since γ > 0 , using ( 3 . 9 ) we deduce that ˆ ρ m 0 = 0 . Furthermore , from I m ( 0 ) = 0 and ( 3 . 15 ) , we get that λ = 0 is associated with the zero eigenmode v m 0 ( r , θ ) = (cid:18) 0 0 (cid:19) cos ( mθ ) , thus λ = 0 is not an eigenvalue for m ≥ 2 and γ > 0 . Let us next look for other roots of H m . Let λ be a positive root of H m , then x = −√ λ < 0 satisﬁes xI ′ m + 1 ( R 0 x ) I m ( R 0 x ) − aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) R 0 mx 2 x 2 + γR 20 m ( m 2 − 1 ) = 0 . Since R 0 xI ′ m ( R 0 x ) I m ( R 0 x ) = R 0 xI m + 1 ( R 0 x ) I m ( R 0 x ) + m , it rewrites as R 0 xI m + 1 ( R 0 x ) I m ( R 0 x ) + m − aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) mx 2 x 2 + γR 20 m ( m 2 − 1 ) = 0 . Using that xI m + 1 ( x ) I m + 1 ( x ) > 0 if x < 0 , we see that there is no positive root of H m if 0 < aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) ≤ 1 . The end of the proof of ( i ) ( the case where λ ∈ C ) is a consequence of Proposition 3 . 7 . Proof of ( ii ) . Let us now prove ( ii ) . To do so let us exhibit a positive eigenvalue of A . More precisely , let us expand H 1 ( λ ) around λ = 0 : H 1 ( λ ) = λ 3 / 2 2 (cid:18) 1 − aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) + 1 8 ( 3 − aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) ) λR 20 (cid:19) + O ( | λ | 7 / 2 ) , which can be written as H 1 ( λ ) = λ 3 / 2 2 g ( λ ) + O ( | λ | 7 / 2 ) . The function g has λ 1 = 8 ( aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) − 1 ) R 20 ( 3 − aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) ) as root , which changes sign from negative to positive as aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) exceeds 1 . Note that λ 1 approximates a true eigenvalue of 21 A , for aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) close to 1 . In such a case , we can write λ 1 = 4 R 20 ( aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) − 1 ) + o ( | aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) − 1 | ) and its associated eigen - mode is v 1 λ 1 ( r , θ ) = (cid:18) λ 1 I 1 ( r √ λ 1 ) − χ ˜ c ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) I 1 ( √ λ 1 ) (cid:19) cos ( θ ) = √ λ 1 2 (cid:18) − λ 1 r χ ˜ c ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) (cid:19) cos ( θ ) + O ( | aχf ′ ( ˜ c ) − 1 | 3 / 2 ) = p aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) − 1 2 (cid:18) 4 R − 0 2 ( 1 − aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) ) r χ (cid:19) cos ( θ ) + O ( | aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) − 1 | 3 / 2 ) , where we expanded the Bessel functions for small values of | λ 1 | . Note that as aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) crosses 1 , the solute gradient component in v 1 λ 1 ( r , θ ) , that is the ﬁrst component , changes its sign and v 1 λ 1 becomes unstable . 4 Proof of Propositions 1 . 3 and 1 . 8 Proof of Proposition 1 . 3 . Concerning P . Since Ω ( t ) = e Ω + ( V , 0 ) t , the shape is stationary and using ( 1 . 6c ) we have ( V , 0 ) · n − u C · n = − ( ∇ P + u C ) · n = 0 in e Γ , where u C is the velocity of the center of mass deﬁned by ( 2 . 3 ) . Hence , u C = ( V , 0 ) = V e x . Let us deﬁne ˜ u in e Ω by ˜ u = −∇ P − u C : = ∇ Φ , with Φ = − P − V x . Then , we see that − Z e Ω Φ∆Φ d x d y = Z e Ω | ∇ Φ | 2 d x d y − Z e Γ Φ ∇ Φ · n d σ . Thanks to incompressibility , we deduce that ∆Φ = 0 in e Ω . Moreover , using the stationary shape condition ( 1 . 8 ) we get ∇ Φ · n = ˜ u · n = 0 over e Γ . Thus , 0 = Z e Ω | ∇ Φ | 2 d x d y = Z e Ω | ˜ u | 2 d x d y . 22 In other words , we ﬁnd that the traveling state is characterized by a uniform ﬂow of the entire ﬂuid bulk , i . e . ∀ t ≥ 0 u ( · , t ) = −∇ P ( · , t ) = u C = ( V , 0 ) in e Ω , hence P ( x , y ) = p 1 − V x on e Γ . Substituting −∇ P = ( V , 0 ) in ( 1 . 6d ) – ( 1 . 6e ) it yields div ( ac ( V , 0 ) + ∇ c ) = 0 in e Ω , ac ( V , 0 ) · n + ∇ c · n = 0 on ∂ e Ω . Concerning c . The fact that c ( x , y ) = c 1 e − aV x in e Ω . follows from Lemma 4 . 1 . Concerning ( 1 . 8 ) . Working in the reference frame of the moving domain , we substitute the expressions of P ( x , y ) and c ( x , y ) in the normal force balance ( 1 . 1b ) and we get that the curvature must satisfy ( 1 . 8 ) . Lemma 4 . 1 . Any non negative solution of ( 1 . 6d ) – ( 1 . 6e ) is given by c ( x , y ) = c 1 e − aV x , where c 1 > 0 . Proof . It is straightforward that e − aV x is a solution of ( 1 . 6d ) – ( 1 . 6e ) . Assume that c ( x , y ) = C 1 ( x , y ) e − aV x is solution of ( 1 . 6d ) – ( 1 . 6e ) , multiplying ( 1 . 6d ) by C 1 ( x , y ) and integrating by parts we obtain Z e Ω ∇ C 1 ( x , y ) · (cid:0) ∇ (cid:0) C 1 ( x , y ) e − aV x (cid:1) + a ( V , 0 ) C 1 ( x , y ) e − aV x (cid:1) d x d y = 0 , hence Z e Ω | ∇ C 1 ( x , y ) | 2 e − aV x d x d y = 0 , which implies ∇ c 1 = 0 . 23 4 . 1 Graph formulation and proof of Proposition 1 . 8 Given γ , p 1 , a , χ > 0 , we look for a set e Ω , solution of ( 1 . 8 ) , in the particular form : e Ω = { ( x , y ) ∈ R 2 ; x L < x < x R , − h ( x ) < y < h ( x ) } ( 4 . 1 ) for some positive function h ( x ) deﬁned on an interval ( x L , x R ) and satisfying : h ( x L ) = h ( x R ) = 0 , ( 4 . 2a ) h ′ ( x L ) = + ∞ , ( 4 . 2b ) h ′ ( x R ) = −∞ . ( 4 . 2c ) Conditions ( 4 . 2 ) have the following meaning . We want symmetric domains e Ω , hence we impose ( 4 . 2a ) . We also want smooth boundaries , so we require ( 4 . 2b ) – ( 4 . 2c ) . A possible domain is given in the following picture . We will further ﬁxe the invariance by translation in the e x direction by requiring that x L < 0 < x R , h ′ ( 0 ) = 0 . ( 4 . 3 ) Our ﬁrst task is to write equation ( 1 . 8 ) , i . e . γκ ( x ) = p 1 − V x − χf M R Ω 0 e − aV x ′ d x ′ d y ′ e − aV x ! on e Γ , with ( 4 . 1 ) – ( 4 . 2 ) in terms of the function h ( x ) . Since the boundary conditions ( 4 . 2 ) concern the function h and also its derivative h ′ , it is natural to identify a problem for which h ′ is solution and then ﬁnd the function h by integration . For this reason , we change variables . We ﬁrst notice that the tangent vector t , the normal vector n and the mean - curvature κ of e Ω are deﬁned by t ( x ) = − ( 1 , h ′ ( x ) ) p 1 + ( h ′ ( x ) ) 2 , n ( x ) = ( − h ′ ( x ) , 1 ) p 1 + ( h ′ ( x ) ) 2 , κ ( x ) = − h ′′ ( x ) ( 1 + ( h ′ ( x ) ) 2 ) 3 / 2 . These quantities can be written easily using the function Y ( x ) deﬁned by Y ( x ) = e x · n ( x ) = n x ( x ) = − h ′ ( x ) p 1 + ( h ′ ( x ) ) 2 . ( 4 . 4 ) 24 In particular , we have κ ( x ) = Y ′ ( x ) , which is consistent with Frenet’s formula n ′ x ( x ) = − κ p 1 + ( h ′ ( x ) ) 2 t x ( x ) . Then , equation ( 1 . 8 ) and condition ( 4 . 3 ) reduce to the following initial value prob - lem : ( γY ′ ( x ) = p 1 − V x − χf (cid:0) c 1 e − aV x (cid:1) on ( x L , x R ) , Y ( 0 ) = 0 , ( 4 . 5 ) where c 1 : = M R e Ω e − aV x d x d y . ( 4 . 6 ) Taking advantage of the fact that e − aV x only depends on the x - coordinate , we rewrite c 1 in ( 4 . 6 ) as c 1 = M 2 R x R x L e − aV x h ( x ) d x . Inverting ( 4 . 4 ) , it yields h ′ ( x ) = − Y ( x ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x ) , ( 4 . 7 ) integrating by parts , we see that c 1 = aV M 2 R x R x L e − aV x h ′ ( x ) d x = − aV M 2 R x R x L e − aV x Y ( x ) ( 1 − Y 2 ( x ) ) 1 / 2 d x , Such a solution has to satisfy the following properties . The boundary conditions ( 4 . 2b ) – ( 4 . 2c ) imply that Y has to verify Y ( x L ) = − 1 and Y ( x R ) = 1 . ( 4 . 8 ) We postpone the proof of the existence and uniqueness of a solution verifying ( 4 . 8 ) to Section 5 ( see Lemmas 5 . 5 and 5 . 7 ) . Finally , using ( 4 . 7 ) , we recover the function h and then we integrate this relation on ( x L , x ) . We recall that the boundary condition ( 4 . 2a ) requires the function Y to satisfy : h ( x R ) − h ( x L ) = − Z x R x L Y ( x ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x ) d x = 0 . ( 4 . 9 ) Proof of Proposition 1 . 8 . We claim that κ is a non - increasing function . Indeed , let 0 < x 1 − x 2 ≪ 1 . Then , κ ( x 1 ) − κ ( x 2 ) reads κ ( x 1 ) − κ ( x 2 ) = − V ( x 1 − x 2 ) + χ (cid:0) f (cid:0) c 1 e − aV x 2 (cid:1) − f (cid:0) c 1 e − aV x 1 (cid:1)(cid:1) ≃ V (cid:0) χac 1 e − aV x 1 f ′ ( c 1 e − aV x 1 ) − 1 (cid:1) ( x 1 − x 2 ) 25 < 0 by ( 1 . 14 ) . It follows that the mean curvature is a decreasing function . Suppose by contradiction that there exists a closed curve ∂ e Ω whose mean curvature is κ . Since (cid:18) 0 0 (cid:19) = Z ∂ e Ω κ n d σ = Z e Ω ∇ κ d x d y = 2 (cid:18)R x R x L h ( x ) κ ′ ( x ) d x 0 (cid:19) , it yields a contradiction with κ ′ ( x ) < 0 and h ( x ) ≥ 0 , this proves Proposition 1 . 8 . 5 Proof of Theorem 1 . 9 This Section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1 . 9 and it gives a constructive proof of the existence of traveling wave solutions of ( 1 . 1 ) when χ > χ ∗ : = πR 2 0 aMf ′ (cid:16) MπR 20 (cid:17) . Here , the constant a ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] and M is deﬁned in ( 1 . 2 ) . Furthermore , R 0 > 0 is the radius of B R 0 , where | B R 0 | ≡ | Ω 0 | . We recall that , assuming | B R 0 | ≡ | Ω 0 | , then Lemma 1 . 6 assures that problem ( 1 . 1 ) admits a unique stationary solution which has the form (cid:16) ˜ c , e P (cid:17) = (cid:18) M πR 20 , γ R 0 + χf (cid:18) M πR 20 (cid:19)(cid:19) = (cid:18) ˜ c , γ R 0 + χf ( ˜ c ) (cid:19) . Hence , the above threshold on χ can be equivalently written as χ > χ ∗ = 1 a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) ( 5 . 1 ) ( see ( 1 . 13 ) too ) . More precisely , we will prove the following result . Theorem 5 . 1 . Assume that f satisﬁes assumptions in ( 1 . 3 ) . Then , for all a ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] , γ , p 1 > χL , there exists a one parameter family of traveling wave solutions ( e Ω p 1 χ , V p 1 χ ) ∈ R 2 × R of ( 1 . 1 ) ( with u = e x ) , parametrized by χ such that χ ∗ ≤ χ < ∞ and satisfying : ( i ) V p 1 χ > 0 when χ > χ ∗ . ( ii ) There exists x L , x R ∈ R , with x L < 0 < x R , and 0 ≤ h such that the set e Ω p 1 χ is a convex set with C 2 , 1 boundary of the form e Ω p 1 χ = { ( x , y ) ; x L < x < x R , − h ( x ) < y < h ( x ) } , with h satisfying h ′ ( 0 ) = 0 . 26 ( iii ) The normal vector n is the vertical vector ( 0 , 1 ) at the point m = ( 0 , h ( 0 ) ) ∈ ∂ e Ω p 1 χ , and the curvature is given by κ ( m ) = p 1 γ − χ γ f ( c 1 ) . ( 5 . 2 ) ( iv ) Assume that f statisﬁes the additional assumption s f ′ ( s ) ≤ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) ∀ s ∈ R + . ( 5 . 3 ) Then , V p 1 χ → V p 1 χ ∗ : = 0 when χ → χ ∗ . Furthermore , Ω p 1 χ ∗ is a disk of radius R 0 and the following relation holds γ = R 0   p 1 − πR 20 f (cid:16) MπR 20 (cid:17) aMf ′ (cid:16) MπR 20 (cid:17)   . ( 5 . 4 ) Remark 5 . 2 ( On Theorem 5 . 1 ) . Property ( i ) guarantees in particular that we are constructing non - trivial traveling wave solutions ( i . e . not stationary solutions ) . Property ( ii ) ﬁxes the natural invariance by translation of the model . Properties ( iii ) and ( iv ) relate the value of the parameter p 1 to some geometric property of e Ω p 1 χ namely its area is | e Ω p 1 χ | = 2 R x R x L h ( x ) d x . It proves that each value of p 1 yields of diﬀerent traveling wave , see ( 5 . 2 ) . In particular , if we let χ → χ ∗ , this relation becomes p 1 = γ R 0 + πR 20 f (cid:16) MπR 20 (cid:17) aMf ′ (cid:16) MπR 20 (cid:17) , ( 5 . 5 ) and it suggests that increasing values of p 1 correspond to sets with decreasing vol - ume . It is the case for the prototype example ( 5 . 6 ) of function f . Remark 5 . 3 . A prototype example of a function satisfying ( 1 . 3 ) and ( 5 . 3 ) is f ( x ) = Lx ˜ c + x . ( 5 . 6 ) In this Section we prove the following Proposition , which implies Theorem 5 . 1 . Proposition 5 . 4 . Assume that f satisﬁes the assumptions in ( 1 . 3 ) . Then , given a , M and R 0 as before , and letting χ as in ( 5 . 1 ) , and p 1 > Lχ , ( 5 . 7 ) there exists V > 0 , x L , x R ∈ R such that the solution Y ( x ) of ( 4 . 5 ) satisﬁes the conditions ( 4 . 8 ) and ( 4 . 9 ) . Furthermore , for a ﬁxed p 1 , the speed V converges to 0 when χ approaches the critical value χ ∗ . Proof of Theorem 5 . 1 . Proof of ( i ) . It follows from Proposition 5 . 4 . 27 Proof of ( ii ) . We recall the notation in Section 4 . 1 so that , thanks also to Proposition 5 . 4 , we set h ( x ) = Z x x L − Y ( x ′ ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x ′ ) d x ′ x ∈ [ x L , x R ] . We also recall the deﬁnition of the set Ω χ by ( 4 . 1 ) , and that ( 4 . 9 ) implies that h ( x L ) = h ( x R ) = 0 . The boundary conditions ( 4 . 8 ) imply that the normal vector is continuous since it achieves the values ( − 1 , 0 ) and ( 1 , 0 ) continuously at the extremal points ( x L , 0 ) and ( x R , 0 ) . This means that ∂ Ω χ is at least C 1 . Furthermore , we have κ ( x ) = Y ′ ( x ) hence Proposition 5 . 9 implies 0 ≤ γκ ≤ p 1 + 4 χ + q ( p 1 − 4 χ ) 2 + 2 V on ∂ Ω χ , thus Ω χ is convex and ∂ Ω χ is C 1 , 1 . In turns , ( 4 . 5 ) can be used to show that Y ′ , and therefore κ is Lipschitz continuous so that the boundary ∂ Ω χ is C 2 , 1 and satisﬁes ( 1 . 8 ) . Proof of ( iii ) . Finally , since Y ( 0 ) = 0 , we get that h ′ ( 0 ) = 0 , and from ( 4 . 5 ) it follows that the mean - curvature of ∂ Ω χ at the point ( 0 , h ( 0 ) ) is given by γY ′ ( 0 ) = p 1 − χf ( c 1 ) . When χ → χ ∗ , we have V → 0 and so Y converges to the solution of γY ′ = p 1 − f ( ˜ c ) a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) . In particular Ω χ converges to the set with constant mean curvature 1 γ (cid:16) p 1 − f ( ˜ c ) a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) (cid:17) , that is the ball B (cid:18) O , γ p 1 − f ( ˜ c ) a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) (cid:19) . Recalling the deﬁnition ( 1 . 12 ) of ˜ c = MπR 20 , we obtain ( 5 . 4 ) and ( 5 . 5 ) . The remainder of this section is devoted to the proof of Proposition 5 . 4 . We ﬁrst ﬁnd the set of parameters for which the points x L and x R satisfying the condition ( 4 . 8 ) exist . This is done in Section 5 . 1 . The existence of the solution Y is then given by regularity properties of the problem ( 4 . 5 ) . We then ﬁx the parameters p 1 , c 1 and χ such that x L exists , by considering the solutions of ( 4 . 5 ) for those values of V such that also x R exists , we will prove , in Section 5 . 1 , that there exists a value V ∗ > 0 ( depending on p 1 , c 1 and χ ) such that the condition ( 4 . 9 ) is veriﬁed . 5 . 1 Proof of Proposition 5 . 4 The diﬃculty in proving an existence result to ( 4 . 5 ) relies on in the fact that the domain ( x L , x R ) is one of the unknown of the problem . Indeed , we need ( x L , x R ) 28 such that condition ( 4 . 8 ) is satisﬁed . A preliminary step consists in dealing with the intermediate problem ( γY ′ ( x ) = p 1 − V x − χf (cid:0) c 1 e − aV x (cid:1) on ( z L , z R ) , Y ( 0 ) = 0 , ( 5 . 8 ) for c 1 = − aV M 2 R z R z L e − aV x Y ( x ) ( 1 − Y 2 ( x ) ) 1 / 2 d x , and given z L < 0 < z R . We can thus apply the Cauchy - Lipschitz Theorem to say that there exists a unique solution Y ∈ C 2 ( [ z L , z R ] ) . For the sake of clarity , we decompose the proof into two steps . First , we prove that we can extend the interval ( z L , z R ) to ( x L , x R ) such that ( 4 . 8 ) holds ( see Lem - mas 5 . 5 and 5 . 7 ) , and then the existence of V > 0 ( see Subsection 5 . 1 . 2 ) . For both steps , we will assume ( 5 . 1 ) and ( 5 . 7 ) , i . e . χ ≥ χ ∗ = πR 20 aMf ′ (cid:16) MπR 20 (cid:17) and p 1 > χL . ( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 . 1 The existence of x L , x R We break the proof in two steps . We ﬁrst give a suﬃcient condition for the existence of x L . Lemma 5 . 5 . Assume that f satisﬁes the assumptions in ( 1 . 3 ) , and that ( 5 . 7 ) holds . For all V ≥ 0 , there exists x L < 0 such that the solution of ( 4 . 5 ) satisﬁes − 1 < Y ( x ) < 0 for all x ∈ ( x L , 0 ) and Y ( x L ) = − 1 . Moreover , x L is such that ( p 1 − Lχ ) − q ( p 1 − Lχ ) 2 + 2 γV V < x L < 0 , and we have Y ′ ( x ) ≥ p 1 − Lχ γ , ∀ x ∈ [ x L , 0 ] . ( 5 . 10 ) Proof . From ( 5 . 7 ) , we see that Y ′ ( 0 ) = κ ( 0 ) = p 1 − χf ( c 1 ) γ ≥ p 1 − Lχ > 0 . Moreover , since Y ( 0 ) = 0 we let x L = inf { z L < 0 ; Y ( x ) ∈ ( − 1 , 0 ) for all x ∈ ( z L , 0 ) } . 29 Note that { z L < 0 ; Y ( x ) ∈ ( − 1 , 0 ) for all x ∈ ( z L , 0 ) } 6 = ∅ thanks to the regularity of Y . We possibly have x L = −∞ if Y ( x ) > − 1 for all x < 0 . Hence , we need to show that x L > −∞ and that Y ( x L ) = − 1 . Recalling assumptions ( 1 . 3 ) , we see that 0 ≤ f ( c 1 e − aV 1 x ) ≤ L , ∀ x ∈ R , thus from ( 5 . 8 ) we deduce p 1 − Lχ − V x ≤ γY ′ ( x ) ≤ p 1 − V x , ∀ x ∈ R . ( 5 . 11 ) Since Y ( 0 ) = 0 , we have − V x 2 2 + p 1 x ≤ γY ( x ) ≤ − V x 2 2 + ( p 1 − Lχ ) x , ∀ x ∈ R − . ( 5 . 12 ) The right - hand side of the previous inequality is negative , monotone increasing on R − and it converges towards −∞ as x → −∞ . Since Y ( x L ) ≥ − 1 , by deﬁnition of x L , it follows that x L > −∞ and ( 5 . 12 ) implies that Y ( x L ) < 0 so that we must have Y ( x L ) = − 1 . Remark 5 . 6 . Note that the assumption p 1 ≥ χL is a suﬃcient condition for the ex - istence of x L . Indeed , we may assume that p 1 ≥ χf ( c 1 ) . However , the disadvantage of such an assumption is that the quantity f ( c 1 ) depends on V . More generally , without any assumption on p 1 we can prove that there exists x L < 0 such that Y ( x L ) = − 1 by using ( 5 . 12 ) . However , in this latter case we can not assure that ( 5 . 10 ) holds . Next , we give a suﬃcient condition for the existence of x R . Lemma 5 . 7 . Assume that f satisﬁes the assumptions in ( 1 . 3 ) , and that ( 5 . 7 ) holds . Then , there exists V max ∈ (cid:20) p 1 − Lχ 2 γ , p 21 2 γ (cid:21) ( 5 . 13 ) such that , for all V ∈ ( 0 , V max ) , there exists x R > 0 such that the solution of ( 4 . 5 ) satisﬁes 0 < Y ( x ) < 1 for all x ∈ ( 0 , x R ) , and Y ( x R ) = 1 . Moreover , x R is such that 0 < x R ≤ p 1 V , and ( Y ′ ( x R ) > 0 , if V < V max , Y ′ ( x R ) = 0 , if V = V max , ( 5 . 14 ) and Y ′ ( x ) ≥ Y ′ ( x R ) ∀ x ∈ [ 0 , x R ] . ( 5 . 15 ) 30 Proof . Since γY ′ ( 0 ) = p 1 − χf ( c 1 ) > 0 , we can deﬁne ¯ x > 0 by ¯ x : = sup { z R > 0 ; Y ′ ( x ) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ ( 0 , z R ) } . In particular , since by ( 1 . 3 ) γY ′ ( x ) ≥ p 1 − V x − χL , we have Y ′ ( x ) ≥ 0 if x ≤ p 1 − LχV . Hence , by deﬁnition , ¯ x ≥ p 1 − Lχ V Furthermore , from ( 5 . 11 ) evaluated in ¯ x and ( 1 . 3 ) , it follows that p 1 − Lχ ≤ V ¯ x + γY ′ ( ¯ x ) ≤ p 1 , hence , recalling ( 5 . 7 ) and thanks to the deﬁnition of ¯ x , we also have ¯ x ≤ p 1 V . Integrating ( 4 . 5 ) in x and using Y ( 0 ) = 0 , we have − V x 2 2 + ( p 1 − Lχ ) x ≤ γY ( x ) ≤ − V x 2 2 + p 1 x , ∀ x ≥ 0 . Recalling that Y is increasing in ( 0 , ¯ x ) , we get ( p 1 − Lχ ) 2 2 γV ≤ Y ( ¯ x ) = sup x ∈ ( 0 , ¯ x ) Y ( x ) ≤ p 21 2 γV . In view of the previous computations , a suﬃcient condition for the existence of x R is Y ( x R ) = 1 and , in such a case , it holds that x R < ¯ x . Deﬁne V max : = sup { V 0 ; Y ( ¯ x ) > 1 , ∀ V ∈ [ 0 , V 0 ) } . We ﬁrst see that ( p 1 − Lχ ) 2 2 γ ≤ V max ≤ p 21 2 γ , and by continuity with respect to V , when V = V max , we have Y ( ¯ x ) ≥ 1 . Fur - thermore , if Y ( ¯ x ) > 1 , then there exists δ > 0 such that sup Y > 1 for V ∈ [ V max , V max + δ ) which contradicts the deﬁnition of V max . Consequently , Y ( ¯ x ) = 1 when V = V max and so x R = ¯ x and Y ′ ( x R ) = 0 . 31 Remark 5 . 8 . As in Remark 5 . 6 , we may weaken the assumption made on p 1 for the existence of x R such that Y ( x R ) = 1 . However in such a case we may not assure that ( 5 . 14 ) and ( 5 . 15 ) hold true . From the two previous Lemma we deduce the following result . Proposition 5 . 9 . Assume that f satisﬁes the assumptions in ( 1 . 3 ) , that ( 5 . 7 ) holds , and that V ∈ ( 0 , V max ) for V max as in ( 5 . 13 ) . Then Y ( x ) the solution of ( 4 . 5 ) satisﬁes 0 ≤ γY ′ ( x ) ≤ Lχ + q ( p 1 − Lχ ) 2 + 2 V ∀ x ∈ ( x L , x R ) . Proof . Lemma 5 . 5 implies that Y ′ ( x ) ≥ 0 on [ x L , 0 ] and Lemma 5 . 7 implies that Y ′ ( x ) ≥ 0 on [ 0 , x R ] . Next , Equation ( 4 . 5 ) implies γY ′ ( x ) ≤ p 1 − V x L , and the upper bound follows from Lemma 5 . 5 . 5 . 1 . 2 The existence of V We now turn to the proof of the existence of V . From now on , we denote by Y ( x , V ) , x L ( V ) , x R ( V ) the solutions of ( 4 . 5 ) , ( 4 . 8 ) for all V ∈ ( 0 , V max ) . Moreover , since we can read c 1 as a function of V , we rewrite it as c 1 ( V ) = − aV M 2 R x R ( V ) x L ( V ) e − aV x Y ( x , V ) ( 1 − Y 2 ( x , V ) ) 1 / 2 d x . To end the proof of Proposition 5 . 4 , we must show that if χ > χ ∗ , then there exists V ∈ ( 0 , V max ) such that ( 4 . 9 ) is satisﬁed . We introduce the function G ( V ) : = Z x R ( V ) x L ( V ) Y ( x , V ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x , V ) d x , ( 5 . 16 ) and ﬁrst prove the following result . Proposition 5 . 10 . The function G : [ 0 , V max ) → R deﬁned by ( 5 . 16 ) is continuous and satisﬁes G ( 0 ) = 0 and G ( V ) → + ∞ as V → V max . Furthermore , when χ > χ ∗ , then it holds G ( V ) < 0 for 0 < V ≪ 1 . Proof . Continuity of V 7→ G ( V ) . Since x L ( V ) and x R ( V ) are determined by the conditions Y ( x L , V ) = − 1 and Y ( x R , V ) = 1 , 32 recalling equations ( 5 . 10 ) and ( 5 . 14 ) , we can apply the Implicit Function Theorem to get that V 7→ x L ( V ) and V 7→ x R ( V ) are continuous functions . To prove the continuity of G , we now consider a sequence V n of positive numbers such that V n → V > 0 . We ﬁx δ > 0 . The continuity of x L and x R implies that for large enough n : x L ( V n ) ≤ x L ( V ) + δ ≤ x L ( V n ) + 2 δ , and x R ( V n ) ≥ x R ( V ) − δ ≥ x R ( V n ) − 2 δ . We claim that Y ( x , V n ) → Y ( x , V ) uniformly in [ x L ( V ) , x R ( V ) ] . Indeed , diﬀerenti - ating equation ( 4 . 5 ) with respect to V , we ﬁnd that the function Z : x 7→ ∂ V Y ( x , V ) solves γZ ′ ( x ) = − x + χ ( ac 1 x − ∂ V c 1 ) e − aV x f ′ (cid:0) c 1 e − aV x (cid:1) on ( x L , x R ) , Z ( 0 ) = 0 , with ∂ V c 1 ( 0 ) = 0 . Then , we have | Y ( x , V n ) | ≤ 1 − η in ( x L ( V ) + δ , x R ( V ) − δ ) , ( 5 . 17 ) for some η > 0 and n large enough . We now write G ( V n ) = Z x R ( V n ) x L ( V n ) Y ( x , V n ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x , V n ) d x = Z x R ( V n ) − δ x L ( V n ) + δ Y ( x , V n ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x , V n ) d x + Z x L ( V n ) + δ x L ( V n ) Y ( x , V n ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x , V n ) d x + Z x R ( V n ) x R ( V n ) − δ Y ( x , V n ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x , V n ) d x . The bound ( 5 . 17 ) implies that Z x R ( V n ) − δ x L ( V n ) + δ Y ( x , V n ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x , V n ) d x → Z x R ( V ) − δ x L ( V ) + δ Y ( x , V ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x , V ) d x for n → ∞ . Next , using that Y veriﬁes ( 5 . 10 ) , we have that | Y ( x ) | ≤ 1 and 1 + Y ( x ) ≥ C ( x − x L ( V n ) ) for x ∈ [ x L ( V n ) , x L ( V n ) + δ ] . It follows that the second term satisﬁes (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Z x L ( V n ) + δ x L ( V n ) Y ( x , V n ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x , V n ) d x (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Z x L ( V n ) + δ x L ( V n ) 1 p C ( x − x L ( V n ) ) d x ≤ C ′ δ 1 / 2 , 33 where C , C ′ are positive constants . Using ( 5 . 15 ) , we obtain a similar bound for the third term and we get that lim n →∞ G ( V n ) = Z x R ( V ) − δ x L ( V ) + δ Y ( x , V ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x , V ) d x + O ( δ 1 / 2 ) = G ( V ) + O ( δ 1 / 2 ) from which we deduce the continuity of G . Proving that G ( 0 ) = 0 . Recalling that c 1 ( 0 ) = ˜ c = M | Ω 0 | , it is easy to check that γY ( x , 0 ) = ( p 1 − χf ( ˜ c ) ) x , x L ( 0 ) = − γ p 1 − χf ( ˜ c ) , x R ( 0 ) = γ p 1 − χf ( ˜ c ) , hence by parity G ( 0 ) = Z γ p 1 − χf ( ˜ c ) − γ p 1 − χf ( c 1 ) ( p 1 − χf ( ˜ c ) ) x (cid:16) γ 2 − ( p 1 − χf ( ˜ c ) ) 2 x 2 (cid:17) 1 / 2 d x = 0 . On the sign of G . Now , we deﬁne the function H : ( − 1 , 1 ) → R by H ( y ) = y p 1 − y 2 . For 0 < V < V max , we have p 1 − χf ( ˜ c ) = γ∂ x Y ( x , V ) + V x + χ (cid:0) f (cid:0) c 1 e − aV x (cid:1) − f ( ˜ c ) (cid:1) , hence G ( V ) = Z x R ( V ) x L ( V ) H ( Y ( x , V ) ) d x = 1 p 1 − χf ( ˜ c ) Z x R ( V ) x L ( V ) ( p 1 − χf ( ˜ c ) ) H ( Y ( x , V ) ) d x = 1 p 1 − χf ( ˜ c ) Z x R ( V ) x L ( V ) (cid:2) γ∂ x Y ( x , V ) + V x + χ (cid:0) f (cid:0) c 1 e − aV x (cid:1) − f ( ˜ c ) (cid:1)(cid:3) H ( Y ( x , V ) ) d x = 1 p 1 − χf ( ˜ c ) Z x R ( V ) x L ( V ) (cid:2) V x + χ (cid:0) f (cid:0) c 1 e − aV x (cid:1) − f ( ˜ c ) (cid:1)(cid:3) H ( Y ( x , V ) ) d x , ( 5 . 18 ) since Z x R ( V ) x L ( V ) ∂ x Y ( x , V ) H ( Y ( x , V ) ) d x = 0 . Note that , for all V ∈ [ 0 , V max ) , we already know that ( H ( Y ( x , V ) ) > 0 for all 0 < x < x R ( V ) , H ( Y ( x , V ) ) < 0 for all x L ( V ) < x < 0 , ( 5 . 19 ) 34 so we need to determine the sign of the function W χ ( x ) : = V x + χ (cid:0) f (cid:0) c 1 e − aV x (cid:1) − f ( ˜ c ) (cid:1) . ( 5 . 20 ) We split this study w . r . t . the cases V ≪ 1 and V → ∞ . Behavior of G for V ≪ 1 . For 0 < V ≪ 1 , using that ∂ V c 1 ( 0 ) = 0 and that c 1 ( 0 ) = ˜ c , we have f ( c 1 ( V ) e − aV x ) = f ( ˜ c ) − ax ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) V + o ( V ) , hence , in such a case , ( 5 . 18 ) becomes G ( V ) = 1 p 1 − χf ( ˜ c Z x R ( V ) x L ( V ) V x (cid:0) 1 − aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) (cid:1) H ( Y ( x , V ) ) d x + o ( V ) = V 1 − aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) p 1 − χf ( ˜ c ) Z x R ( V ) x L ( V ) xH ( Y ( x , V ) ) d x + o ( V ) . Using ( 5 . 19 ) we deduce that for 0 < V ≪ 1 the sign of G ( V ) is that of ( p 1 − χf ( ˜ c ) ) (cid:0) 1 − aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) (cid:1) . The condition ( 5 . 9 ) implies that it is negative . Behavior of G when V → V max . Equation ( 5 . 14 ) gives : ∂ x Y ( x R ( V max ) , V max ) = 0 . Recalling that α : = 2 ∂ xx Y ( x R ( V max ) , V max ) ≤ 0 , we deduce Y ( x , V max ) = 1 + α ( x − x R ( V max ) ) 2 + O (cid:0) | x − x R ( V max ) | 3 (cid:1) as x → x R . ( 5 . 21 ) Thus , we get 1 − Y 2 ( x , V ) = − 2 α ( x − x R ( V ) ) 2 + O (cid:0) | x − x R ( V ) | 3 (cid:1) , leading to p 1 − Y 2 ( x , V ) = p 2 | α | | x − x R ( V ) | + O (cid:16) | x − x R ( V ) | 3 / 2 (cid:17) . ( 5 . 22 ) We notice that for all ε > 0 the function G can be written by G ( V ) = Z x R ( V ) − ε x L ( V ) Y ( x , V ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x , V ) d x + Z x R ( V ) x R ( V ) − ε Y ( x , V ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x , V ) d x . The ﬁrst right hand side is always ﬁnite , while the second right hand side by ( 5 . 21 ) and ( 5 . 22 ) for V → V max we get that Z x R ( V ) x R ( V ) − ε Y ( x , V ) p 1 − Y 2 ( x , V ) d x ≃ Z x R ( V ) x R ( V ) − ε 1 √ 2 | x − x R ( V ) | d x = + ∞ . 35 Therefore , for V → V max we get that G ( V ) → + ∞ , which completes the proof of Proposition 5 . 10 . Proposition 5 . 4 is a consequence of the following result . Corollary 5 . 11 . Let ( 5 . 9 ) be in force . Then , there exists V χ ∈ ( 0 , V max ) such that G ( V χ ) = 0 . Furthermore , assume in addition that f satisﬁes ( 5 . 3 ) . Then , V χ → 0 as χ → χ ∗ . Proof . The Corollary follows from Proposition 5 . 10 . Indeed , for any χ > χ ∗ the Intermediate Value Theorem gives the existence of V χ > 0 such that G ( V χ ) = 0 . In order to show that V χ → 0 as χ → χ ∗ , we note that if we consider G as a function of χ and V ( instead of V only ) , then the continuity with respect to χ can be proved similarly to that with respect to V . Consider the situation where χ → χ ∗ along any subsequence such that V χ → V ∗ . Such a subsequence exists since 0 ≤ V ≤ V max ≤ p 21 2 γ . In such a case we have 0 = G ( χ , V χ ) → G ( χ ∗ , V ∗ ) . It remains to prove that G ( χ ∗ , V ) > 0 for all V > 0 from which it would follow that V ∗ = 0 and hence the whole sequence V χ converges to zero . Recalling the deﬁnition ( 5 . 20 ) of W , we see that W ′ χ ∗ ( x ) = V 1 − c 1 e − aV x f ′ (cid:0) c 1 e − aV x (cid:1) ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) ! . Consequently , if f satisﬁes the additional assumption ( 5 . 3 ) , then W ′ ( x ) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ R and hence H ( Y ( x , V ) ) W ( x ) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ R . 6 Proof of Theorem 1 . 10 In this section , we show that a bifurcation of traveling wave solutions occurs from the family of radially symmetric steady states B R 0 . This bifurcation is determined by the following parameters : the size of the cell R 0 , the active parameter χ , the constant M deﬁned in ( 1 . 2 ) , a and the function f . It is convenient to choose χ as the bifurcation parameter in the bifurcation conditions . More precisely , we will prove the following result which implies Theorem 1 . 10 . Theorem 6 . 1 . Assume that f satisﬁes the assumptions in ( 1 . 3 ) . Then , problem ( 1 . 1 ) has a branch of traveling wave solutions ( e Ω R 0 χ , V R 0 χ ) with volume | B R 0 | bifur - cating from the radial solution B R 0 at χ = χ ∗ . The next result characterizes the structure of the bifurcating branch of the traveling wave . 36 Theorem 6 . 2 . Assume that f satisﬁes the assumptions in ( 1 . 3 ) . Then , the bifur - cation solution has the following form : χ ( s ) = πR 20 aMf ′ (cid:16) MπR 20 (cid:17) + η s 2 + o ( s 2 ) , V ( s ) = s + o ( s ) , where η ∈ R and the parameter s takes values in an interval ( − δ , δ ) . Remark 6 . 3 . By lack of uniqueness , we cannot claim that the V function in The - orem 6 . 2 is the same as the previous existence Theorems . Since the disk is a solution of the system ( 1 . 6a ) – ( 1 . 6e ) with zero bulk velocity V = 0 , our aim is to seek for other solutions in the form of a perturbation of the disk of radius R 0 . We seek for those domain Ω 0 of the form Ω 0 = { ( r , θ ) : 0 ≤ r < R 0 + ρ ( θ ) and θ ∈ [ − π , π ] } , where the function ρ : R → ( − R 0 , ∞ ) is 2 π - periodic and such that Z π − π (cid:0) ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) 2 − R 20 (cid:1) d θ = 0 ( 6 . 1 ) ( this condition guarantees that | Ω 0 | = | B R 0 | ) . Furthermore , since we look for traveling wave propagating in the x - direction , we restrict ourselves ( as in the previous section ) to domain Ω 0 that are symmetric with respect to the y - axis . We thus introduce the functional space : X = (cid:8) ρ ∈ C 2 , α per ( − π , π ) : ρ ( θ ) = ρ ( − θ ) , ∀ θ ∈ ( − π , π ) (cid:9) . Note that the boundary ∂ Ω 0 is parametrized by (cid:16) ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) cos θ , ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) sin θ (cid:17) for θ ∈ [ − π , π ] , the normal vector is given by n ( θ ) = 1 ( ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) 2 + ρ ′ ( θ ) 2 ) 1 / 2 (cid:18) ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) cos θ + ρ ′ ( θ ) sin θ ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) sin θ − ρ ′ ( θ ) cos θ (cid:19) , and the mean - curvature by κ ( θ ) = ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) 2 + 2 ρ ′ ( θ ) 2 − ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) ρ ′′ ( θ ) ( ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) 2 + ρ ′ ( θ ) 2 ) 3 / 2 . In such a case , equation ( 1 . 8 ) can be rewritten as γκ ( θ ) + χf (cid:16) c 1 ( V , ρ ) e − aV ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) cos θ (cid:17) + V ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) cos θ = p 1 , ( 6 . 2 ) 37 for all θ ∈ [ − π , π ) , where we recall that c 1 ( V , ρ ) is deﬁned by c 1 ( V , ρ ) = M R π − π R R 0 + ρ ( θ ) r = 0 e − aV r cos θ r d r d θ . ( 6 . 3 ) Therefore , the existence of a boundary ∂ Ω 0 solving ( 1 . 8 ) follows from the exis - tence of a function ρ solution of equation ( 6 . 2 ) . Before getting into the real proof , we also introduce the functional space Y = C 0 , α per ( − π , π ) . The existence of solutions of ( 6 . 2 ) is proved by the following result . Theorem 6 . 4 . There exists an interval I = ( − ε , + ε ) and four C 1 functions ρ : I × [ − π , + π ] → R , χ : I → R , V : I → R , p 1 : I → R , such that , for all s ∈ I , the equation ( 6 . 2 ) has a solution ρ ( s , θ ) for all θ ∈ [ − π , π ] representing a parametrization of the boundary ∂ Ω 0 with χ = χ ( s ) , V = V ( s ) and p 1 = p 1 ( s ) . Remark 6 . 5 ( On Theorems 5 . 1 and 6 . 4 ) . We note that our two approaches , Theo - rem 5 . 1 on the one hand and Theorems 6 . 4 on the other hand are diﬀerent . Indeed , the ﬁrst result ﬁxes the Lagrange multiplier p 1 , while the second one ﬁxes the vol - ume . However , if the radius R 0 of Theorems 6 . 4 veriﬁes | ˜Ω R 0 χ | = πR 20 , then both approaches prove the existence of non trivial traveling wave solutions for χ > χ ∗ , which converge to B R 0 when χ → χ ∗ . Otherwise , ( e Ω p 1 χ ∗ , V p 1 χ ∗ ) = ( e Ω R 0 χ ∗ , V R 0 χ ∗ ) = ( e Ω χ ∗ , 0 ) . Theorem 1 . 9 can be interpreted as a bifurcation in p 1 , since the immobile , circular solution always exists , and this result shows that for suﬃciently large p 1 there are non - trivial traveling waves . We take advantage of the following Lemma . Lemma 6 . 6 . Assume that f satisﬁes the assumptions in ( 1 . 3 ) . Then , the functional F deﬁned by ( 6 . 4 ) has the following properties 1 . F ( χ , 0 , 0 , 0 ) = 0 for all χ ∈ R . 2 . Ker ∂ ( ρ , V , p 1 ) F ( χ ∗ , 0 , 0 , 0 ) is a one dimensional subspace of R × X × R × R spanned by ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) ; 3 . Range ∂ ( ρ , V , p 1 ) F ( χ ∗ , 0 , 0 , 0 ) is a closed subspace of Y × R × R × R of codimension 1 . Remark 6 . 7 . Note that points 2 . and 3 . imply that F is a Fredholm mapping of order zero . 38 Proof of Lemma 6 . 6 . We deﬁne the function F : R × X × R × R → Y × R × R × R by F ( χ , ρ , V , p 1 ) = (cid:16) γκ ( θ ) + χf (cid:16) c 1 ( V , ρ ) e − aV ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) cos θ (cid:17) ( 6 . 4 ) + V ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) cos θ − γ R 0 − p 1 , Z π − π (cid:0) ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) 2 − R 20 (cid:1) d θ , Z π − π ρ ( θ ) cos θ d θ , Z π − π ρ ( θ ) sin θ d θ (cid:17) , with c 1 ( V , ρ ) deﬁned by ( 6 . 3 ) . Proof of 1 . The ﬁrst point is obvious . Proof of 2 . Next , recalling the deﬁnition of F in ( 6 . 4 ) , we compute L χ : = ∂ ( ρ , V , p 1 ) F ( χ , 0 , 0 , 0 ) which is the linear operator L χ : X × R × R → Y × R × R × R deﬁned by L χ ( ρ , V , p 1 ) = F ρ ( χ , 0 , 0 , 0 ) [ ρ ] + F V ( χ , 0 , 0 , 0 ) V + F p 1 ( χ , 0 , 0 , 0 ) p 1 ( 6 . 5 ) evaluated in ( χ , 0 , 0 , 0 ) . We recall that the linear operator F ρ ( χ , ρ , V , p 1 ) is deﬁned by F ρ ( χ , ρ , V , p 1 ) [ η ] = d d ε F ( χ , ρ + εη , V , p 1 ) | ε = 0 for η ∈ X . We thus compute : F ( χ , ρ + εη , V , p 1 ) = (cid:16) γ κ ρ + εη ( θ ) + χf (cid:16) c 1 ( V , ρ + εη ) e − aV ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) + εη ( θ ) ) cos θ (cid:17) + V [ R 0 + ρ ( θ ) + εη ( θ ) ] cos ( θ ) − γ R 0 − p 1 , Z π − π ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) + εη ( θ ) ) 2 − R 20 d θ , Z π − π [ ρ ( θ ) + εη ( θ ) ] cos θ d θ , Z π − π [ ρ ( θ ) + εη ( θ ) ] sin θ d θ (cid:17) , ( 6 . 6 ) where κ ρ + εη ( θ ) is the mean - curvature of the perturbed boundary , that is κ ρ + εη ( θ ) 39 = [ R 0 + ρ ( θ ) + εη ( θ ) ] 2 + 2 [ ρ ′ ( θ ) + εη ′ ( θ ) ] 2 − [ R 0 + ρ ( θ ) + εη ( θ ) ] [ ρ ′′ ( θ ) + εη ′′ ( θ ) ] [ ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) + εη ( θ ) ) 2 + ( ρ ′ ( θ ) + εη ′ ( θ ) ) 2 ] 3 / 2 . We now derive ( 6 . 6 ) with respect to ε , we set ε = 0 , and we ﬁnally consider ρ = 0 , V = 0 and p 1 = 0 . Hence , for η = ρ , we ﬁnd the following expression F ρ ( χ , 0 , 0 , 0 ) [ ρ ] = (cid:18) − γ ρ ( θ ) + ρ ′′ ( θ ) R 0 − χ ˜ cR 0 f ′ ( ˜ c ) Z π − π ρ ( θ ) d θ , ( 6 . 7 ) 2 R 0 Z π − π ρ ( θ ) d θ , Z π − π ρ ( θ ) cos θ d θ , Z π − π ρ ( θ ) sin θ d θ (cid:19) . The second and the third terms in ( 6 . 5 ) are simpler to compute since V and p 1 are real quantities . We obtain that F V ( χ , 0 , 0 , 0 ) V = (cid:0) − V R 0 aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) cos θ + V R 0 cos θ , 0 , 0 , 0 (cid:1) since ∂ V c 1 ( 0 , 0 ) = 0 , and F p 1 ( χ , 0 , 0 , 0 ) p 1 = ( − p 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) . ( 6 . 8 ) Finally , the linear operator L χ is given by the sum of the expressions ( 6 . 7 ) – ( 6 . 8 ) , that is L χ ( ρ , V , p 1 ) = (cid:18) − γ ρ ( θ ) + ρ ′′ ( θ ) R 20 − R 0 χ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) Z π − π ρ ( θ ) d θ − V R 0 aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) cos θ + V R 0 cos θ − p 1 , 2 R 0 Z π − π ρ ( θ ) dθ , Z π − π ρ ( θ ) cos θ d θ , Z π − π ρ ( θ ) sin θ d θ (cid:19) . When χ ∗ = 1 a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) , we get L χ ∗ ( ρ , V , p 1 ) = (cid:18) − γ ρ ( θ ) + ρ ′′ ( θ ) R 20 − R 0 a Z π − π ρ ( θ ) d θ − p 1 , 2 R 0 Z π − π ρ ( θ ) d θ , Z π − π ρ ( θ ) cos θ d θ , Z π − π ρ ( θ ) sin θ d θ (cid:19) . ( 6 . 9 ) Thus , the elements { ( ρ , V , p 1 ) } belonging to Ker L χ ∗ are such that ρ ′′ ( θ ) + ρ ( θ ) + R 30 aγ Z π − π ρ ( θ ) d θ = − R 20 γ p 1 . Using the condition R π − π ρ ( θ ) d θ = 0 , we obtain that ρ ′′ ( θ ) + ρ ( θ ) = − R 20 γ p 1 . ( 6 . 10 ) 40 The parameter V does not appear in equation ( 6 . 10 ) , so ( 0 , V , 0 ) ∈ Ker L χ ∗ for all V ∈ R and thus dim Ker L χ ∗ ≥ 1 . Furthermore , if ( ρ , p 1 ) solves ( 6 . 10 ) , then ρ has the form ρ ( θ ) = a cos θ + b sin θ − R 20 γ p 1 , for some a , b ∈ R . We use the conditions Z π − π ρ ( θ ) d θ = 0 , Z π − π ρ ( θ ) cos θ d θ = 0 , Z π − π ρ ( θ ) sin θ d θ = 0 to determine the coeﬃcients a , b and to identify p 1 . These integral conditions re - spectively imply that p 1 = 0 , a = 0 and b = 0 , hence Ker L χ ∗ = span { ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) } and dim Ker L χ ∗ = 1 . Proof of 3 . Next , we show that the range of L χ ∗ consists of all the quadruplets ( h , C 1 , C 2 , C 3 ) ∈ Y × R × R × R such that Z π − π h ( θ ) cos θ d θ = 0 . The fact that this condition is necessary is obtained by multiplying the equation − γ ρ ( θ ) + ρ ′′ ( θ ) R 20 − p 1 = h ( 6 . 11 ) by cos ( θ ) and integrating over ( − π , π ) . To check that this condition is suﬃcient , we note that , for given h ∈ C 0 , α per ( − π , π ) and p 1 ∈ R , equation ( 6 . 11 ) has a solution in C 2 , α per ( − π , π ) if and only if R π − π h ( θ ) cos θ d θ = R π − π h ( θ ) sin θ d θ = 0 , and the general solution is of the form ρ ( θ ) = ¯ ρ ( θ ) + a cos θ + b sin θ , for some particular solution ¯ ρ , which we can assume to be even ( otherwise we replace it with 12 [ ¯ ρ ( θ ) + ¯ ρ ( − θ ) ] ) . When h ∈ Y , the condition R π − π h ( θ ) sin θ d θ = 0 is always satisﬁed since h is even , and we ﬁnd a solution in X by taking the even part of ρ : ρ ( θ ) = 1 2 [ ¯ ρ ( θ ) + ¯ ρ ( − θ ) ] + a cos θ . We then choose a so that R π − π ρ ( θ ) cos θ d θ = C 2 and integrating ( 6 . 11 ) with respect to θ yields − γ R 20 Z π − π ρ ( θ ) d θ − 2 πp 1 = Z π − π f ( θ ) d θ so we can now choose p 1 so that 2 R 20 R π − π ρ ( θ ) d θ = C 2 . Proof of Theorem 6 . 4 . Lemma 6 . 6 imply that we can apply the Implicit Function Theorem to F . 41 Proof of Theorem 1 . 10 . We follow the arguments contained in [ 4 , Theorem 6 . 4 ] to prove the existence of a brunch bifurcating traveling wave solutions . In partic - ular , we want to exploit the Leray - Schauder degree theory and its connection with bifurcation points . We refer to the Appendix B for a brief synthesis on the theory hidden in the proof below . We omit the dependence on the parameter s when possible . We take advantage of the expression of the mean - curvature in polar coordinates to rewrite ( 6 . 2 ) as ( R 0 + ρ ) ρ ′′ − ( ρ ′ ) 2 ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + ( ρ ′ ) 2 ( 6 . 12 ) = 1 + (cid:16) ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + ( ρ ′ ) 2 (cid:17) 12 γ (cid:20) χf (cid:16) c 1 e − aV ( R 0 + ρ ) cos θ (cid:17) + V ( R 0 + ρ ) cos θ − p 1 (cid:21) with ρ = ρ ( θ ) for all θ ∈ [ − π , π ) , where we recall that c 1 ( V , ρ ) is deﬁned by ( 6 . 3 ) . Since arctan (cid:18) ρ ′ R 0 + ρ (cid:19) ′ = ( R 0 + ρ ) ρ ′′ − ( ρ ′ ) 2 ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + ( ρ ′ ) 2 , we integrate ( 6 . 12 ) twice in θ , and we get that ρ = K ( ρ , V ; s ) for K ( ρ , V ; s ) = Z θ 0 ( R o + ρ ) tan (cid:20) ψ + Z ψ 0 (cid:16) ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + ( ρ ′ ) 2 (cid:17) 12 γ (cid:20) χf (cid:16) c 1 e − aV ( R 0 + ρ ) cos ψ ′ (cid:17) + V ( R 0 + ρ ) cos ψ ′ − p 1 (cid:21)(cid:21) dψ ′ dψ . Since we have supposed that the domain is symmetric w . r . t . the x - axis , we have that ρ is an even function , so ρ ′ ( 0 ) = 0 . We also recall that the area preservation condition Z π − π ρ ( θ ) dθ = 0 is veriﬁed ( see ( 6 . 1 ) ) . We set the center of mass of the domain at the origin : 1 3 Z π − π ( R 0 + ρ ( θ ) ) 3 cos θ dθ = 0 . 42 This implies that we do not consider copies of solutions translated in the x - direction . The previous conditions lead us to ρ = K 1 ( ρ , V ; s ) = K ( ρ , V ; s ) − 1 2 π Z π − π K ( ρ , V ; s ) dθ . Now , setting V = K 2 ( ρ , V ; s ) = V + 1 3 Z π − π ( R 0 + ρ ) 3 cos θ dθ , the problem reduces to the following ﬁxed point one ( ρ , V ) = ( K 1 ( ρ , V ; s ) , K 2 ( ρ , V ; s ) ) = K ( ρ , V ; s ) in X × R . ( 6 . 13 ) Remark 6 . 8 ( On the operator K ) . We here collect some remarks on the component K 1 of the operator K . • Note that , if ρ ∈ X , then K 1 ( ρ , V ; s ) ∈ X . Moreover , by the deﬁnition of K , K 1 ( ρ , V ; s ) maps even functions in even ones . • The K 1 just deﬁned is equivalent to the ﬁrst component of the operator F deﬁned in ( 6 . 4 ) . In particular , this means that the Lemma 6 . 6 holds for K , i . e . K ( 0 , 0 ; s ) = 0 ∀ s ∈ R , and that K is Fr´echet diﬀerentiable in 0 ( see the proof of Lemma 6 . 6 ) . We can thus linearize K as explained in Remark B . 5 . Reasoning as in the proof of Lemma 6 . 6 , the linearizations of K 1 , K 2 around the point ( 0 , 0 ; s ) , p 1 = 0 , are L ρ ( ρ , V ; s ) = R 30 γ Z θ 0 Z ψ 0 V (cid:0) − χa ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) + 1 (cid:1) cos ψ ′ − γ R 30 ρ dψ ′ dψ − C ( 6 . 14 ) L V ( ρ , V ; s ) = V + R 20 Z π − π ρ cos θ dθ ( 6 . 15 ) where C is the mean value of the ﬁrst term in L ρ ( ρ , V ; s ) . Thanks again to Remark B . 5 , we proceed computing the eigenvalues of ( L ρ ( ρ , V ; s ) , L V ( ρ , V ; s ) ) = L ( ρ , V ; s ) . In particular , it is without loss of generality that we reduce the case V 6 = 0 to V = ± 1 by rescaling arguments . We begin considering ( ρ , V ) = ( ρ , ± 1 ) . Let E 1 be the desired eigenvalue . Then , from ( 6 . 15 ) , we have Z π − π ρ cos θ dθ = E 1 − 1 R 20 . 43 We now derive ( 6 . 14 ) L ρ ( ρ , V ; s ) = E 1 ρ twice by θ , obtaining cos θ (cid:0) − a ˜ cχf ′ ( ˜ c ) + 1 (cid:1) − γ R 30 ρ = γ R 30 E 1 ρ ′′ . Then , we multiply this equation by cos θ , and we integrate in [ − π , π ] , getting that (cid:0) − aχ ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) + 1 (cid:1) π = γ ( E 1 − 1 ) 2 R 50 , otherwise , by deﬁnition of χ ∗ , (cid:18) 1 − χ χ ∗ (cid:19) π = γ ( E 1 − 1 ) 2 R 50 ∀ χ ( s ) ≤ χ ∗ . ( 6 . 16 ) We set E 1 , 1 = R 20 s R 0 γ (cid:18) 1 − χ χ ∗ (cid:19) π + 1 ≥ 1 , E 1 , 2 = − R 20 s R 0 γ (cid:18) 1 − χ χ ∗ (cid:19) π + 1 ≤ 1 . We claim that the cases E 1 , 1 = E 1 , 2 = 1 are not admitted . Indeed , this would mean that χ ( s ) = χ ∗ = χ ( 0 ) , i . e . , χ = χ ( s ) constant , so no bifurcation occurs . The case ( ρ , V ) = ( ρ , − 1 ) can be dealt with in the same way , and it leads to − (cid:18) 1 − χ χ ∗ (cid:19) π = γ ( E − 1 − 1 ) 2 R 50 ∀ χ ( s ) ≥ χ ∗ . ( 6 . 17 ) This means that , there is a jump of the local Leray - Scauder index through s = 0 . As far as the case ( ρ , V ) = ( ρ , 0 ) is concerned , we need Z π − π ρ cos θ dθ = 0 . Hence ρ = cos mθ , m ≥ 2 . Reasoning as before , we get that the condition − ρ = E 0 , m ρ ′′ has to be satisﬁed . Then E 0 , m = m − 2 . 44 Note that E 0 , m < 1 for all m ≥ 2 . We now want to prove that ( 0 , 0 ; s ∗ ) is a bifurcation point for some s ∗ ∈ R . In order to do so , we are going to apply Theorems B . 4 and B . 8 . Since we have that the l . h . s . of ( 6 . 16 ) ( resp . ( 6 . 17 ) ) is positive if χ ∗ > χ ( s ) ( resp . χ ∗ < χ ( s ) ) , we can identify a value s − ( resp . s + ) such that deg LS ( I − K ( ρ , V ; s ± ) , B ε ( 0 ) , 0 ) is well deﬁned for B ε ( 0 ) = n ( ρ , V ) : | V | < ε , k ρ k C 2 , α per ( − π , π ) < ε o , ε ≪ 1 . We now claim that ( 0 , 0 ; s ) is an isolated solution for every s ∈ R . Indeed , K is Fr´echet diﬀerentiable at 0 , and 1 belongs to the resolvent of L because none of the eigenvalues we found is equal to 1 . Then , being the assumptions of Theorem B . 4 satisﬁed , ( 0 , 0 ; s ) is an isolated solution and , thanks also to ( B . 2 ) , we get that deg LS ( I − K ( ρ , V ; s ± ) , B ε ( 0 ) , 0 ) = ( − 1 ) m ± , where m ± have been deﬁned in Theorem B . 4 , and m + ( resp . m − ) refers to s + ( resp . s − ) . In order to verify that we have a bifurcation point , it suﬃces to prove that m − 6 = m + ( see Theorem B . 8 ) . Since the number of eigenvalues contained in ( 1 , + ∞ ) coincides at s ± for E 1 , but it diﬀers by one for E 0 , m , we conclude that deg LS ( I − K ( ρ , V ; s − ) , B ε ( 0 ) , 0 ) 6 = deg LS ( I − K ( ρ , V ; s + ) , B ε ( 0 ) , 0 ) , and then , from Theorem B . 8 , there exists a s ∗ ∈ [ min s ± , max s ± ] such that ( 0 , 0 ; s ∗ ) is the desired bifurcation point . This means that there exists a sequence of solutions ( V ε , ρ ε ) ∈ ∂B ε ( 0 ) such that ( V ε , ρ ε ; s ε ) → ( 0 , 0 ; s ∗ ) . ( see Deﬁnition B . 7 ) . We point out that we must have ( V ε , ρ ε ) ∈ ∂B ε ( 0 ) because ( V , ρ ) = ( 0 , 0 ) is an isolated solution in B ε ( 0 ) for ε small enough . To conclude this proof , we have just to show that the sequence ( V ε , ρ ε ) is made of traveling waves . This is trivial since , being ( V ε , ρ ε ) solutions to I − K ( ρ , V ; s ) , then they verify Deﬁnition 1 . 2 ( see also ( 1 . 8 ) in Remark 1 . 4 ) by ( 6 . 13 ) . 45 7 Proof of Theorem 6 . 2 We now give some qualitative results on the nature of the bifurcating branch of traveling waves , using Crandall - Rabinowitz bifurcation results . In what follow , we assume that f veriﬁes ( 1 . 3 ) and also f ∈ C 3 ( R + ) . We begin recalling Lemma 6 . 6 , and we prove the following . Lemma 7 . 1 . Let the assumptions of Lemma 6 . 6 be in force . Then the functional F deﬁned by ( 6 . 4 ) also veriﬁes ∂ χ ∂ ( ρ , V , p 1 ) F ( χ ∗ , 0 , 0 , 0 ) [ ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) ] / ∈ Range ∂ ( ρ , V , p 1 ) F ( χ ∗ , 0 , 0 , 0 ) . Proof . We note that the original problem ( 1 . 6a ) – ( 1 . 6e ) is invariant by translation . Thus , it is natural to eliminate these invariances by looking for solution of ( 6 . 2 ) satisfying the orthogonality conditions Z π − π ρ ( θ ) cos θ d θ = 0 and Z π − π ρ ( θ ) sin θ d θ = 0 . We prove the transversality condition with respect to the value χ ∗ , that is we have to prove that ( ∂ χ L χ ∗ ) ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) / ∈ Range L χ ∗ ( see ( 6 . 9 ) for the deﬁnition of L χ ∗ ) . We have ( ∂ χ L χ ∗ ) ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) = ( − aR 0 ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) cos θ , 0 , 0 , 0 ) . Assume by contradiction that ( ∂ χ L χ ∗ ) ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) ∈ Range L χ ∗ . Then , we would have that γ ρ ( θ ) + ρ ′′ ( θ ) R 20 + R 0 a Z π − π ρ ( θ ) d θ + p 1 = aR 0 ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) cos θ . Multiplying by cos θ and integrating on [ − π , π ] , it yields that γ Z π − π ρ ( θ ) cos θ d θ + γ Z π − π ρ ′′ ( θ ) cos θ d θ ( 7 . 1 ) + (cid:18) R 0 a Z π − π ρ ( θ ) d θ + p 1 (cid:19) R 20 Z π − π cos θ d θ = R 30 f ′ ( ˜ c ) a ˜ c Z π − π cos 2 θ d θ . Integrating by parts twice the second term of the left - hand side and using that ρ ′ is a 2 π - period function together with R π − π ρ ( θ ) cos θ d θ = 0 , we deduce that Z π − π ρ ′′ ( θ ) cos θ d θ = Z π − π ρ ′ ( θ ) sin θ d θ = − Z π − π ρ ( θ ) cos θ d θ = 0 . Then , equation ( 7 . 1 ) leads to 0 = R 30 a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) π , which is a contradiction since f ′ ( ˜ c ) > 0 . 46 Theorem 7 . 2 . Let the assumptions of Theorem 6 . 4 be in force . Then , the functions χ : I → R and V : I → R verify ( i ) V = V ( s ) = s + o ( s ) for all s ∈ I . ( ii ) χ ( 0 ) = 1 a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) , χ ′ ( 0 ) = 0 and χ ′′ ( 0 ) = − aMR 20 2 ( f ′ ( ˜ c ) ) 2 (cid:20) M 2 πR 20 f ′′′ ( ˜ c ) + f ′′ ( ˜ c ) (cid:21) . Proof . We can now apply the Crandall - Rabinowitz Bifurcation Theorem C . 1 . Let us denote by Z any complement space of Ker L χ ∗ , there exists an interval I = ( − ε , ε ) and four C 1 functions ϕ : I → R , ψ 1 : I × [ − π , π ] → Z , ψ 2 : I → Z and ψ 3 : I → Z such that F ( ϕ ( s ) , ψ 1 ( s , θ ) , ψ 2 ( s ) , ψ 3 ( s ) ) = ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) for all s ∈ I , θ ∈ [ − π , π ] , ( 7 . 2 ) and ϕ ( 0 ) = 1 a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) , ψ 1 ( 0 , θ ) = 0 for all θ ∈ [ − π , π ] , ψ 2 ( 0 ) = 0 , ψ 3 ( 0 ) = 0 . In particular , the solutions ( χ , ρ , V , p 1 ) = ( χ ( s ) , ρ ( s , θ ) , V ( s ) , p 1 ( s ) ) of the equation F ( χ , ρ , V , p 1 ) = ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) are of the form ( χ ( s ) = ϕ ( s ) , ρ ( s , θ ) = 0 + s ψ 1 ( s , θ ) , V ( s ) = s + s ψ 2 ( s ) , p 1 ( s ) = 0 + s ψ 3 ( s ) ( 7 . 3 ) and they verify χ ( 0 ) = χ ∗ = 1 a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) , ρ ( 0 , θ ) = ∂ s ρ ( 0 , θ ) = 0 for all θ ∈ [ − π , π ] , V ( 0 ) = 0 and V ′ ( 0 ) = 1 , p 1 ( 0 ) = p ′ 1 ( 0 ) = 0 . ( 7 . 4 ) The point ( ii ) will follow from Lemma 7 . 3 and 7 . 4 below . In the proofs that follow , we use extensively the fact that the functions θ 7→ ρ ( 0 , θ ) and θ 7→ ∂ s ρ ( 0 , θ ) ( and all their derivatives with respect to θ ) vanish . Using that Z π − π ρ ( s , θ ) cos θ d θ = 0 and Z π − π (cid:0) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) 2 − R 20 (cid:1) d θ = 0 for all s , we also have Z π − π ∂ n s ρ ( 0 , θ ) cos θ d θ = 0 ∀ n ∈ N and Z π − π ∂ ss ρ ( 0 , θ ) d θ = 0 . ( 7 . 5 ) Some technical computations are contained in the Appendix ( see Sections C . 2 – C . 3 ) . 47 Lemma 7 . 3 . Assume that ( C . 1 ) holds . Then , we have χ ′ ( 0 ) = 0 . Proof . We recall that κ ( s , θ ) = ( ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + 2 ∂ θ ρ 2 − ( R 0 + ρ ) ∂ θθ ρ ) ( s , θ ) (cid:0) ( ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + ∂ θ ρ 2 ) 3 / 2 (cid:1) ( s , θ ) , ( 7 . 6 ) and we set z ( s , θ ) = c 1 ( V , ρ ) e − aV ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) cos θ , ( 7 . 7 ) with c 1 ( V , ρ ) given by ( 6 . 3 ) . We diﬀerentiate with respect to s the ﬁrst component of F given by ( 6 . 4 ) and we use ( 7 . 2 ) to obtain 0 = γ∂ s κ ( s , θ ) + χ ′ ( s ) f ( z ( s , θ ) ) + χ ( s ) f ′ ( z ( s , θ ) ) ∂ s z ( s , θ ) ( 7 . 8 ) + V ′ ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) cos θ + V ( s ) ∂ s ρ ( s , θ ) cos θ − p ′ 1 ( s ) . Let s = 0 . Then , ( 7 . 4 ) implies that c 1 ( V , ρ ) = ˜ c , hence z ( 0 , θ ) = ˜ c for all θ ∈ [ − π , π ] . Consequently , ( 7 . 8 ) simply writes as γ∂ s κ ( 0 , θ ) + χ ′ ( 0 ) f ( ˜ c ) + χ ( 0 ) f ′ ( ˜ c ) ∂ s z ( 0 , θ ) + R 0 cos θ = 0 . ( 7 . 9 ) Recalling that χ ( 0 ) = 1 a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) and ( C . 6 ) , it follows that ( 7 . 9 ) simpliﬁes as γ∂ s κ ( 0 , θ ) + χ ′ ( 0 ) f ( ˜ c ) = 0 . The conclusion follows since we know that ∂ s κ ( 0 , θ ) = 0 ( see Lemma C . 3 ) and f ( ˜ c ) 6 = 0 ( see assumptions ( 1 . 3 ) ) . Lemma 7 . 4 . Assume ( C . 3 ) . It holds that χ ′′ ( 0 ) = − aMR 20 2 ( f ′ ( ˜ c ) ) 2 (cid:20) M 2 πR 20 f ′′′ ( ˜ c ) + f ′′ ( ˜ c ) (cid:21) . Proof . We now diﬀerentiate twice equation ( 7 . 8 ) with respect to s , obtaining 0 = γ∂ sss κ ( s , θ ) + χ ′′′ ( s ) f ( z ( s , θ ) ) + 3 χ ′′ ( s ) f ′ ( z ( s , θ ) ) ∂ s z ( s , θ ) + 3 χ ′ ( s ) [ f ′′ ( z ( s , θ ) ) ( ∂ s z ( s , θ ) ) 2 + f ′ ( z ( s , θ ) ) ∂ ss z ( s , θ ) ] + χ ( s ) [ f ′′′ ( z ( s , θ ) ) ( ∂ s z ( s , θ ) ) 3 + 3 f ′′ ( z ( s , θ ) ) ∂ s z ( s , θ ) ∂ ss z ( s , θ ) + f ′ ( z ( s , θ ) ) ∂ sss z ( s , θ ) ] + V ′′′ ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) cos θ + 3 V ′′ ( s ) ∂ s ρ ( s , θ ) cos θ + 3 V ′ ( s ) ∂ ss ρ ( s , θ ) cos θ + V ( s ) ∂ sss ρ ( s , θ ) cos θ − p ′′′ 1 ( s ) . ( 7 . 10 ) Since we have ( 7 . 3 ) , ( C . 3 ) , ( C . 6 ) , and Lemma 7 . 3 , the expression in ( 7 . 10 ) for s = 0 becomes 0 = γ∂ sss κ ( 0 , θ ) + χ ′′′ ( 0 ) f ( ˜ c ) − 3 a ˜ cR 0 χ ′′ ( 0 ) f ′ ( ˜ c ) cos θ 48 + 1 a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) [ − f ′′′ ( ˜ c ) ( a ˜ cR 0 cos θ ) 3 − 3 a ˜ cR 0 cos θf ′′ ( ˜ c ) ∂ ss z ( 0 , θ ) + f ′ ( ˜ c ) ∂ sss z ( 0 , θ ) ] + V ′′′ ( 0 ) R 0 cos θ − p ′′′ 1 ( 0 ) . ( 7 . 11 ) We multiply ( 7 . 11 ) by cos θ , and we integrate in θ : 0 = γ Z π − π ∂ sss κ ( 0 , θ ) cos θ dθ − 3 πa ˜ cR 0 χ ′′ ( 0 ) f ′ ( ˜ c ) + 1 a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) − 3 π 4 f ′′′ ( ˜ c ) ( a ˜ cR 0 ) 3 − 3 a ˜ cR 0 f ′′ ( ˜ c ) Z π − π cos 2 θ∂ ss z ( 0 , θ ) dθ + f ′ ( ˜ c ) Z π − π cos θ∂ sss z ( 0 , θ ) dθ ! + πV ′′′ ( 0 ) R 0 . Using Lemma C . 6 , we simplify as follows : 0 = − 3 πa ˜ cR 0 χ ′′ ( 0 ) f ′ ( ˜ c ) + 1 a ˜ cf ′ ( ˜ c ) (cid:20) − 3 π 4 f ′′′ ( ˜ c ) ( a ˜ cR 0 ) 3 − 3 2 a 3 M 2 ˜ cR 0 f ′′ ( ˜ c ) (cid:21) + 1 a ˜ c (cid:18) − aM R 0 V ′′′ ( 0 ) − 2 M πR 30 Z π − π cos θ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) dθ (cid:19) + πV ′′′ ( 0 ) R 0 . ( 7 . 12 ) Since ˜ c = M / πR 20 , ( 7 . 12 ) becomes as 0 = − 3 aM R 0 χ ′′ ( 0 ) f ′ ( ˜ c ) − 3 a 2 M 2 R 0 2 f ′ ( ˜ c ) (cid:20) M 2 πR 20 f ′′′ ( ˜ c ) + f ′′ ( ˜ c ) (cid:21) − 2 aR 0 Z π − π cos θ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) dθ . Using ( 7 . 5 ) , we ﬁnally get χ ′′ ( 0 ) = − aMR 20 2 ( f ′ ( ˜ c ) ) 2 (cid:20) M 2 πR 20 f ′′′ ( ˜ c ) + f ′′ ( ˜ c ) (cid:21) . A Spectrum of the heat equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition We recall here some facts concerning the spectrum of the heat equation with homo - geneous Neumann boundary condition . Let m ∈ Z , z ∈ C , and w : C → R . Then , the Bessel and the modiﬁed Bessel second - order diﬀerential equations read z 2 w ′′ ( z ) + zw ′ ( z ) + ( z 2 − m 2 ) w ( z ) = 0 , ( A . 1 ) and z 2 w ′′ ( z ) + zw ′ ( z ) − ( z 2 + m 2 ) w ( z ) = 0 . ( A . 2 ) 49 The Bessel J m and the modiﬁed Bessel I m functions of the ﬁrst kind of order m ∈ Z are particular solutions to ( A . 1 ) and ( A . 2 ) , and their expressions are J m ( x ) = ∞ X p = 0 ( − 1 ) p p ! ( p + m ) ! (cid:16) x 2 (cid:17) 2 p + m , ( A . 3 ) and i m I m ( x ) = J m ( ix ) , ( A . 4 ) that is I m ( x ) = ∞ X p = 0 1 p ! ( m + p ) ! (cid:16) x 2 (cid:17) m + 2 p . ( A . 5 ) Note that I m and J m verify the following equation : − 2 J ′ m ( x ) = J m + 1 ( x ) − J m − 1 ( x ) , ( A . 6 ) where J ′ m ( x ) is the derivative of J m ( x ) . Lemma A . 1 . For all z ∈ C , there holds zI m + 1 ( z ) I m ( ¯ z ) − ¯ zI m + 1 ( ¯ z ) I m ( z ) = (cid:0) z 2 − ¯ z 2 (cid:1) Z 1 0 uI m ( uz ) I m ( u ¯ z ) d u . ( A . 7 ) Let λ m , p be the p - th real positive root of J ′ m , the derivative of J m , such that λ m , p + 1 > λ m , p > · · · > λ m , 0 > 0 . ( A . 8 ) We consider the heat equation with Neumann boundary condition ∂ t c ( t , r , θ ) = ∆ c ( t , r , θ ) ( r , θ ) ∈ [ 0 , 1 ) × [ − π , π ) , ( A . 9a ) ∂ r c ( t , 1 , θ ) = 0 θ ∈ [ − π , π ) . ( A . 9b ) Proposition A . 2 . The spectrum of the operator ( A . 9 ) is { − λ 2 m , p , ( m , p ) ∈ N × N } . B Bifurcation through the Leray - Schauder degree theory We here give a very brief background on the ( huge ) theory regarding the Leray - Schauder degree and the local Leray - Schauder index , LS degree and LLS index from now on . A synthesis of the incoming presentation is given in [ 25 ] . We also recall the link among the above notions and bifurcation points . For this part , we mainly refer to [ 20 ] . 50 The LS degree is a powerful tool that , under suitable hypothesis , algebraically counts the number of zeros of functions . In our case , we are interested in functions of the type I − F , so that their zeros are , actually , ﬁxed points . The LS degree is deﬁned in normed linear space which may be inﬁnite - dimensional , and its expression can be derived from the Brouwer degree theory ( see , for instance , [ 8 , Chapters 8 and 9 ] , [ 14 , Chapter 2 ] , and [ 8 , Theorem 10 . 6 ] too ) . However , we do not deepen more in this direction because it would require technical tools from homology theory . The interested reader can ﬁnd the construction of the LS degree from the Brouwer one , for instance , in [ 14 , Section 3 . 3 ] , [ 8 , Chapter 10 ] . The well - posedness setting for the LS degree is the following . Let X be a real Banach space , U a bounded open subset of X , and Ψ a mapping such that Ψ = I − F : U → X , where F : U → X is a continuous and compact map . Then , the LS degree deg LS [ Ψ , U , z ] , with z ∈ X and z / ∈ Ψ ( ∂U ) , is a function which associates to the triple ( Ψ , U , z ) a certain integer . For the sake of completeness , we here list some of the most important properties that deg LS veriﬁes . We also refer to [ 14 , Section 3 . 2 . 2 ] , [ 8 , Chapter 11 ] , and [ 11 , Appendix ] . Theorem B . 1 ( [ 14 , Theorem 3 . 2 . 2 ] ) . Let Y = { ( Ψ , U , z ) deﬁned as above } . Then , there exists a function deg LS : Y → Z such that the following properties are satisﬁed : • normalization : deg LS [ I , U , z ] = 1 for all z ∈ U ; • additivity : if U 1 , U 2 are open subsets of U such that U 1 ∩ U 2 = ∅ , and z / ∈ Ψ ( U \ ( U 1 ∪ U 2 ) ) , then deg LS [ Ψ , U , z ] = deg LS [ Ψ , U 1 , z ] + deg LS [ Ψ , U 2 , z ] ; • homotopy invariance : if h : [ 0 , 1 ] × U → X is compact , y : [ 0 , 1 ] → X is continuous , and y ( t ) / ∈ Ψ ( ∂U ) for all t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] , then deg LS [ I − h ( 0 , · ) , U , y ( 0 ) ] = deg LS [ I − h ( 1 , · ) , U , y ( 1 ) ] . We also recall the following Theorem ( see also [ 14 , Proposition 3 . 2 . 6 ] ) . 51 Theorem B . 2 ( [ 8 , Theorem 11 . 1 ] ) . If deg LS [ Ψ , U , z ] 6 = 0 , then Ψ ( x ) = 0 , i . e . , F ( x ) = x for some x ∈ U . However , we are not interested in applying the LS degree theory to ﬁnd ﬁxed points , but bifurcation ones . To this aim , let us introduce the bifurcation parameter s ∈ R . We represent the dependence on s of the function Ψ with the subscript s : s → Ψ ( x ; s ) = Ψ s ( x ) . Roughly speaking , once we know that Ψ s ( x 0 ) = 0 for a certain x 0 ∈ U and for all s ∈ R , then we can exploit the link among LS degree and bifurcation points to show that there exists a value s 0 ∈ R such that ( x 0 ; s 0 ) is a bifurcation point . With this aim , we restrict our attention to the particular case of isolated solutions , whose deﬁnition is given below . Deﬁnition B . 3 ( Isolated solution [ 23 , Section 8 ] ) . Let B ε ( x 0 ) = { x : k x − x 0 k X < ε } . Then , we say that x 0 is an isolated solution to Ψ ( x 0 ) = x 0 − F ( x 0 ) = z if the only solution contained in B ε ( x 0 ) is x = x 0 . Let us show the connection among LS degree , LLS index , and solutions to Ψ ( x ) = 0 . We refer to [ 23 , Section 8 ] for the incoming results . Assume that there exists a ﬁnite number of x i / ∈ ∂U such that they are the only points satisfying Ψ ( x i ) = x i − F ( x i ) = z for 1 ≤ i ≤ r < ∞ . Then , the LS degree can be expressed through the following formula : deg LS [ Ψ , U , z ] = r X i = 1 ind ( Ψ , x i ) . ( B . 1 ) The formula in ( B . 1 ) implies that , if x 0 is an isolated solution , then deg LS [ Ψ , B ε ( x 0 ) , y ] = ind ( Ψ , x 0 ) . Hence , in order to compute the LS degree of isolated solutions , it suﬃces to have a representation formula for the LLS index in this particular case . It is with this reason that we recall the following result . 52 Theorem B . 4 ( [ 11 , Lemma A . 4 ] ) . Let 0 ∈ U and F ( 0 ) = 0 . Assume that F is Fr´echet diﬀerentiable at 0 ∈ X , and 1 belongs to the resolvent set of F ′ ( 0 ) . Then , 0 is an isolated solution to Ψ ( x ) = 0 and ind ( Ψ , 0 ) = ( − 1 ) m , where m is the sum of the multiplicities of the characteristic values of F ′ ( 0 ) in the interval ( 0 , 1 ) . We recall that • a characteristic values of F ′ ( 0 ) is a real number µ such that the equation µF ′ ( 0 ) x = x has a non - trivial solution ; • the algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue µ is , in this case , the dimension of ∪ k ∈ N (cid:0) I − µF ′ ( 0 ) (cid:1) k ; • the resolvent set is given by R \ n 1 µ : µF ′ ( 0 ) x = x o . Then , the m - power is the sum of the algebraic multiplicities of the real eigenvalues to F ′ ( 0 ) that are greater than one . Remark B . 5 ( [ 20 , Chapter IV § 2 ] ) . Let F as in Theorem B . 4 . Then , the operator F can be expressed in the form F = F ′ ( 0 ) + R , being F ′ ( 0 ) its Fr´echet derivative evaluated in 0 , and where the term R veriﬁes lim k x k X k R ( x ) k X k x k X = 0 . This is an important remark because , instead of dealing with a possibly nonlinear F , we can consider its linearization F ′ ( 0 ) . Resuming , the above Theorem B . 4 and ( B . 1 ) imply that deg LS [ Ψ , B ε ( 0 ) , 0 ] = ind ( Ψ , 0 ) = ( − 1 ) m , ( B . 2 ) for m deﬁned as in Theorem B . 4 . We now complete the puzzle showing the link among LLS index and bifurcation points . Roughly speaking , as explained in [ 7 , Section 6 ] , we need to have a change of degree at a certain point in order to have a bifurcation at this point . 53 Deﬁnition B . 6 ( Bifurcation point - [ 21 , Section 5 ] ) . Assume that F is a linear compact Fredholm mapping of order zero , i . e . ImF is closed in X and dim kerF = codim ImF < ∞ . Assume also that Ψ s ( 0 ) = 0 . Then , the couple ( 0 ; s 0 ) ∈ D = { ( 0 ; s ) ∈ X × R } is a bifurcation point for the solutions of Ψ s ( x ) = 0 w . r . t . D if every neighborhood of ( 0 ; s 0 ) ∈ U × R contains at least one solution ( x ; s ) 6 = ( 0 ; s ) to Ψ s ( x ) = 0 . Deﬁnition B . 7 ( Bifurcation point - [ 25 , Section 8 ] ) . Let F : U → X completely continuous , and Ψ s ( 0 ) = 0 for every s ∈ R . Then , the couple ( 0 ; s 0 ) is a bifurcation point to Ψ s ( x ) = 0 if there exists a sequence { ( x k ; s k ) } of solutions to Ψ s k ( x k ) = 0 with ( x k ; s k ) ∈ ( U \ { 0 } ) × R such that s k → s 0 and k x k k X → 0 . We refer also to [ 7 ] , [ 35 , Section 1 ] and [ 20 , Chapter IV p . 181 ] for the notion of bifurcation point in Deﬁnition B . 7 . Theorem B . 8 ( [ 21 , Proposition 2 ] , [ 20 , Chapter IV § 5 ] ) . Let F as in Theorem B . 4 . Assume that , for some s 1 < s 2 , we know that ind ( Ψ s i , 0 ) is well - deﬁned , and ind ( Ψ s 1 , 0 ) 6 = ind ( Ψ s 2 , 0 ) . Then , there exists an s 0 ∈ [ s 1 , s 2 ] such that ( 0 ; s 0 ) is a bifurcation point for Ψ . C Bifurcation through Crandall - Rabinowitz theory C . 1 A theorem of Crandall - Rabinovitz We recall here the classical Bifurcation Theorem of Crandall - Rabinovitz [ 10 ] that we used to prove Theorem 7 . 2 . Given U , V two real Banach spaces and a continuous map F : R × U → V , the goal is to analyze the structure of the solution set F [ λ , u ] = 0 , ( λ , u ) ∈ R × U . Theorem C . 1 ( Local bifurcation [ 10 ] ) . Let U , V be Banach spaces , W a neighbor - hood of ( λ 0 , 0 ) in R × U , and F : W −→ V . Suppose that the following properties are satisﬁed 1 . F ( λ , 0 ) = 0 for all λ in a neighborhood of λ 0 ; 2 . The Fr´echet partial derivatives ∂ u F , ∂ λ F , ∂ λu F exist and are continuous ; 3 . Ker ∂ u F ( λ 0 , 0 ) is a one dimensional subspace of U spanned by a nonzero vector u 0 ∈ U ; 4 . Range ∂ u F ( λ 0 , 0 ) is a closed subspace of V of codimension 1 ; 5 . ∂ λu F ( λ 0 , 0 ) [ u 0 ] / ∈ Range ∂ u F ( λ 0 , 0 ) . 54 Then , for any complement Z of Ker ∂ u F ( λ 0 , 0 ) in U , there exist a neighborhood N of ( λ 0 , 0 ) in R × U , an interval I = ( − ε , ε ) for some ε > 0 and two continuous functions ϕ : ( − ε , ε ) −→ R , ψ : ( − ε , ε ) −→ Z such that ϕ ( 0 ) = λ 0 , ψ ( 0 ) = 0 and F − 1 [ 0 ] ∩ U = { ( ϕ ( s ) , s u 0 + s ψ ( s ) ) : | s | < ε } ∪ { ( λ , 0 ) : ( λ , 0 ) ∈ N } . Furthermore , if ∂ uu F is continuous then the functions ρ and ψ are once continuously diﬀerentiable . Remark C . 2 ( Bifurcation point through Jordan curves ) . In Theorem C . 1 , ( λ 0 , 0 ) is a bifurcation point of the equation F ( λ , u ) = 0 in the following sense : in a neighborhood of ( λ 0 , 0 ) , the set of solutions of F ( λ , u ) = 0 consists of two curves Γ 1 and Γ 2 which intersect only at the point ( λ 0 , 0 ) ; Γ 1 is the curve ( λ 0 , 0 ) and Γ 2 can be parameterized as follows : Γ 2 : ( λ ( s ) , u ( s ) ) , | s | small ; ( λ ( 0 ) , u ( 0 ) ) = ( λ 0 , 0 ) ; u ′ ( 0 ) = u 0 , λ ′ ( 0 ) 6 = 0 . C . 2 Computation of ∂ s κ , ∂ ss κ and ∂ sss κ Recall that ρ ( s , θ ) and κ ( s , θ ) are deﬁned by ( 7 . 3 ) , ( 7 . 4 ) and ( 7 . 6 ) for s ∈ I and θ ∈ [ − π , π ] . Lemma C . 3 . Assume ∂ nθ ρ ( 0 , θ ) = ∂ nθ ∂ s ρ ( 0 , θ ) = 0 ∀ θ ∈ [ − π , π ] , ∀ n ∈ N . ( C . 1 ) Then ∂ s κ ( 0 , θ ) = 0 and R 20 ∂ ss κ ( 0 , θ ) = − ∂ ss ρ ( 0 , θ ) − ∂ ss θθ ρ ( 0 , θ ) . ( C . 2 ) Proof . We deﬁne the functions N ( s , θ ) = (cid:2) ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + 2 ∂ θ ρ 2 − ( R 0 + ρ ) ∂ θθ ρ (cid:3) ( s , θ ) , D ( s , θ ) = h ( ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + ∂ θ ρ 2 ) 3 / 2 i ( s , θ ) . Then , we can rewrite κ ( s , θ ) and ∂ s κ ( s , θ ) as κ ( s , θ ) = N ( s , θ ) D ( s , θ ) and ∂ s κ ( s , θ ) = (cid:20) ( ∂ s N ) D − N ( ∂ s D ) D 2 (cid:21) ( s , θ ) with ( ∂ s N ) ( s , θ ) = [ 2 ( R 0 + ρ ) ∂ s ρ + 4 ∂ θ ρ ∂ s θ ρ − R 0 ∂ s θθ ρ − ∂ s ρ ∂ θθ ρ − ρ ∂ s θθ ρ ] ( s , θ ) , 55 ( ∂ s D ) ( s , θ ) = h 3 ( ∂ θ ρ ∂ s θ ρ + ( R 0 + ρ ) ∂ s ρ ) p ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + ( ∂ θ ρ ) 2 i ( s , θ ) . Since ( C . 1 ) holds for all θ , we see that ( ∂ s N ) ( 0 , θ ) = ( ∂ s D ) ( 0 , θ ) = 0 , so ∂ s κ ( 0 , θ ) = 0 . Next , we deﬁne n ( s , θ ) = ( ( ∂ s N ) D − N ( ∂ s D ) ) ( s , θ ) and d ( s , θ ) = D 2 ( s , θ ) , so that ∂ s κ ( s , θ ) = n ( s , θ ) d ( s , θ ) and ∂ ss κ ( s , θ ) = (cid:20) ( ∂ s n ) d − n ( ∂ s d ) d 2 (cid:21) ( s , θ ) . We compute ( ∂ s n ) ( s , θ ) = [ ( ∂ ss N ) D − N ( ∂ ss D ) ] ( s , θ ) and ( ∂ s d ) ( s , θ ) = [ 2 D∂ s D ] ( s , θ ) , with ( ∂ ss N ) ( s , θ ) = (cid:2) 2 ∂ s ρ 2 + ( 2 R 0 + 2 ρ − ∂ θθ ρ ) ∂ ss ρ + 4 ( ∂ s θ ρ ) 2 + 4 ∂ θ ρ ∂ ss θ ρ − R 0 ∂ ss θθ ρ − 2 ∂ s ρ∂ s θθ ρ − ρ∂ ss θθ ρ ] ( s , θ ) , ( ∂ ss D ) ( s , θ ) = h 3 ( ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + ( ∂ θ ρ ) 2 ) − 1 / 2 ( ( R 0 + ρ ) ∂ s ρ + ∂ θ ρ∂ s θ ρ ) 2 + 3 p ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + ( ∂ θ ρ ) 2 ( ( ∂ s ρ ) 2 + ( R 0 + ρ ) ∂ ss ρ + ( ∂ s θ ρ ) 2 + ∂ θ ρ∂ ss θ ρ ) (cid:3) ( s , θ ) . Using ( C . 1 ) , we see that ( ∂ ss N ) ( 0 , θ ) = 2 R 0 ∂ ss ρ ( 0 , θ ) − R 0 ∂ ss θθ ρ ( 0 , θ ) ( ∂ ss D ) ( 0 , θ ) = 3 R 20 ∂ ss ρ ( 0 , θ ) . Then , since N ( 0 , θ ) = R 20 , D ( 0 , θ ) = R 30 , ( ∂ s D ) ( 0 , θ ) = 0 , we deduce ∂ s n ( 0 , θ ) = − R 40 ∂ ss ρ ( 0 , θ ) − R 40 ∂ ss θθ ρ ( 0 , θ ) , ∂ s d ( 0 , θ ) = 0 . We gather the above computations and we ﬁnally have that ∂ ss κ ( 0 , θ ) = (cid:20) ( ∂ s n ) d − n ( ∂ s d ) d 2 (cid:21) ( s , θ ) = ∂ s n ( 0 , θ ) D 2 ( 0 , θ ) = − R 40 ∂ ss ρ ( 0 , θ ) − R 40 ∂ ss θθ ρ ( 0 , θ ) R 60 , so ( C . 2 ) follows . 56 Remark C . 4 . Note that , if we also suppose that ∂ nθ ∂ ss ρ ( 0 , θ ) = 0 for all θ ∈ [ − π , π ] and n ≥ 0 , then ∂ ss κ ( 0 , θ ) = 0 . Lemma C . 5 . Assume ∂ nθ ρ ( 0 , θ ) = ∂ nθ ∂ s ρ ( 0 , θ ) = ∂ nθ ∂ ss ρ ( 0 , θ ) = 0 ∀ θ ∈ [ − π , π ] , ∀ n ∈ N . ( C . 3 ) Then R 20 ∂ sss κ ( 0 , θ ) = − ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) − ∂ sss θθ ρ ( 0 , θ ) , hence Z π − π ∂ sss κ ( 0 , θ ) cos θ d θ = 0 . Proof . Since we now assume that ∂ ss ρ ( 0 , θ ) ( and all its derivatives w . r . t . θ ) is zero , the computations in Lemma C . 3 give in particular ∂ ss N ( 0 , θ ) = 0 , ∂ ss D ( 0 , θ ) = 0 . Next , we deﬁne a ( s , θ ) = ( ( ∂ s n ) d − n ( ∂ s d ) ) ( s , θ ) and b ( s , θ ) = d 2 ( s , θ ) . We thus write ∂ sss κ ( s , θ ) as ∂ sss κ ( s , θ ) = (cid:20) ( ∂ s a ) b − a ( ∂ s b ) b 2 (cid:21) ( s , θ ) . ( C . 4 ) We compute ( ∂ s a ) ( s , θ ) = [ ( ∂ ss n ) d − n ( ∂ ss d ) ] ( s , θ ) and ( ∂ s b ) ( s , θ ) = 2 [ d ∂ s d ] ( s , θ ) , where ( ∂ ss n ) ( s , θ ) = ( ( ∂ sss N ) D − N ( ∂ sss D ) + ( ∂ ss N ) ∂ s D − ( ∂ s N ) ( ∂ ss D ) ) ( s , θ ) , ( ∂ ss d ) ( s , θ ) = 2 ( ( ∂ s D ) 2 + D ∂ ss D ) ( s , θ ) , with ( ∂ sss N ) ( s , θ ) = ( 6 ∂ s ρ ∂ ss ρ + ( 2 R 0 + 2 ρ − ∂ θθ ρ ) ∂ sss ρ + 12 ∂ s θ ρ ∂ ss θ ρ + 4 ∂ θ ρ∂ sss θ ρ − ( R 0 + ρ ) ∂ sss θθ ρ − 3 ∂ ss ρ∂ s θθ ρ − 3 ∂ s ρ∂ ss θθ ρ ) ( s , θ ) ( ∂ sss D ) ( s , θ ) = − 3 ( ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + ( ∂ θ ρ ) 2 ) − 3 / 2 ( ( R 0 + ρ ) ∂ s ρ + ∂ θ ρ∂ s θ ρ ) 3 + 9 ( ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + ( ∂ θ ρ ) 2 ) − 1 / 2 ( ( R 0 + ρ ) ∂ s ρ + ∂ θ ρ∂ s θ ρ ) ( ∂ θ ρ∂ ss θ ρ + ( ∂ s ρ ) 2 ) 57 + 9 ( ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + ( ∂ θ ρ ) 2 ) − 1 / 2 ( ( R 0 + ρ ) ∂ s ρ + ∂ θ ρ∂ s θ ρ ) (cid:0) ( R 0 + ρ ) ∂ ss ρ + ( ∂ s θ ρ ) 2 (cid:1) + 3 p ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + ( ∂ θ ρ ) 2 ) ( 3 ∂ s ρ∂ ss ρ + ( R 0 + ρ ) ∂ sss ρ ) + 3 p ( R 0 + ρ ) 2 + ( ∂ θ ρ ) 2 ) ( 3 ∂ s θ ρ∂ ss θ ρ + ∂ θ ρ∂ sss θ ρ ) ( s , θ ) . Using ( C . 3 ) , we get : ∂ sss N ( 0 , θ ) = 2 R 0 ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) − R 0 ∂ sss θθ ρ ( 0 , θ ) , ∂ sss D ( 0 , θ ) = 3 R 20 ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) . Furthermore , since N ( 0 , θ ) = R 20 , D ( 0 , θ ) = R 30 , ∂ s D ( 0 , θ ) = ∂ ss D ( 0 , θ ) = 0 , we deduce that ( ∂ ss n ) ( 0 , θ ) = [ ( ∂ sss N ) D − N ( ∂ sss D ) ] ( 0 , θ ) = − R 4 0 ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) − R 4 0 ∂ sss θθ ρ ( 0 , θ ) , ( ∂ ss d ) ( 0 , θ ) = 0 . Hence , recalling also that ∂ s d ( 0 , θ ) = 0 , ( ∂ s a ) ( 0 , θ ) = [ ( ∂ ss n ) d − n ( ∂ ss d ) ] ( 0 , θ ) = − R 100 ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) − R 100 ∂ sss θθ ρ ( 0 , θ ) , ( ∂ s b ) ( 0 , θ ) = 2 ( d ∂ s d ) ( 0 , θ ) = 0 , and ( C . 4 ) becomes ∂ sss κ ( 0 , θ ) = − R 100 ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) − R 100 ∂ sss θθ ρ ( 0 , θ ) R 120 , so the result follows . In particular R 20 Z π − π ∂ sss κ ( 0 , θ ) cos θ d θ = − R 20 Z π − π ( ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) + ∂ sss θθ ρ ( 0 , θ ) ) cos θ d θ = − R 2 0 Z π − π ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) cos θ d θ + R 2 0 Z π − π ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) cos θ d θ = 0 . C . 3 Computation of ∂ s z , ∂ ss z and ∂ sss z Recall that ρ ( s , θ ) and κ ( s , θ ) are deﬁned by ( 7 . 3 ) , ( 7 . 4 ) and ( 7 . 6 ) for s ∈ I and θ ∈ [ − π , π ] . 58 Lemma C . 6 . Assume ( C . 1 ) . Then for all θ ∈ [ − π , π ] we have Z π − π ∂ s z ( 0 , θ ) d θ = 0 . Furthermore , if we also have ( C . 3 ) , then Z π − π ∂ ss z ( 0 , θ ) d θ = Z π − π cos 2 θ∂ ss z ( 0 , θ ) d θ = a 2 M 2 2 , and Z π − π cos θ∂ sss z ( 0 , θ ) d θ = − aM R 0 V ′′′ ( 0 ) − 2 M πR 30 Z π − π cos θ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) dθ . Proof . Recalling the deﬁnition of z ( 7 . 7 ) , we see that ∂ s z ( s , θ ) = A ( s , θ ) e − aV ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) cos θ , with A ( s , θ ) = ∂ s c 1 ( V , ρ ) − a cos θc 1 ( V , ρ ) ∂ s ( V ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) ) = V ′ ( s ) ∂ V c 1 ( V , ρ ) + ∂ s ρ ( s , θ ) ∂ ρ c 1 ( V , ρ ) − c 1 ( V , ρ ) a (cid:0) V ′ ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) + V ( s ) ∂ s ρ ( s , θ ) (cid:1) cos θ , and c 1 given by ( 6 . 3 ) . Since ∂ V c 1 ( 0 , 0 ) = 0 , c 1 ( 0 , 0 ) = ˜ c , ( C . 5 ) we deduce that A ( 0 , θ ) = − a ˜ cR 0 cos θ , hence ∂ s z ( 0 , θ ) = − a ˜ cR 0 cos θ , ( C . 6 ) and the ﬁrst result follows . We now assume ( C . 3 ) . Diﬀerentiating again , we obtain ∂ ss z ( s , θ ) = B ( V , ρ ) e − aV ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) cos θ , with B ( s , θ ) = ∂ s A ( s , θ ) − A ( s , θ ) a (cid:0) V ′ ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) + V ( s ) ∂ s ρ ( s , θ ) (cid:1) cos θ , and ∂ s A ( s , θ ) = V ′′ ( s ) ∂ V c 1 ( V , ρ ) + (cid:0) V ′ ( s ) (cid:1) 2 ∂ V V c 1 ( V , ρ ) + ∂ ss ρ ( s , θ ) ∂ ρ c 1 ( V , ρ ) + ( ∂ s ρ ( s , θ ) ) 2 ∂ ρρ c 1 ( V , ρ ) + 2 V ′ ( s ) ∂ s ρ ( s , θ ) ∂ V ρ c 1 ( V , ρ ) 59 − (cid:0) V ′ ( s ) ∂ V c 1 ( V , ρ ) + ∂ s ρ ( s , θ ) ∂ ρ c 1 ( V , ρ ) (cid:1) a (cid:0) V ′ ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) + V ( s ) ∂ s ρ ( s , θ ) (cid:1) cos θ − c 1 ( V , ρ ) a (cid:0) V ′′ ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) + 2 V ′ ( s ) ∂ s ρ ( s , θ ) + V ( s ) ∂ ss ρ ( s , θ ) (cid:1) cos θ . Since we have that ( C . 3 ) and ( C . 5 ) hold , the above expression reduces to ∂ s A ( 0 , θ ) = ∂ V V c 1 ( 0 , 0 ) − ˜ caR 0 V ′′ ( 0 ) cos θ . Using also that ∂ V V c 1 ( 0 , 0 ) = − a 2 M 4 π ( C . 7 ) we obtain ∂ s A ( 0 , θ ) = − a 2 M 4 π − a ˜ cV ′′ ( 0 ) R 0 cos θ , and then B ( 0 , θ ) = − a 2 M 4 π − a ˜ cV ′′ ( 0 ) R 0 cos θ + a 2 ˜ cR 20 cos 2 θ = − a 2 M 4 π − aM πR 0 V ′′ ( 0 ) cos θ + a 2 M π cos 2 θ = − a 2 M 4 π (cid:0) 1 − 4 cos 2 θ (cid:1) − aM πR 0 V ′′ ( 0 ) cos θ thanks to the deﬁnition of ˜ c . Hence , ∂ ss z ( 0 , θ ) = − a 2 M 4 π (cid:0) 1 − 4 cos 2 θ (cid:1) − aM πR 0 V ′′ ( 0 ) cos θ . Then Z π − π ∂ ss z ( 0 , θ ) dθ = − a 2 M 4 π Z π − π (cid:0) 1 − 4 cos 2 θ (cid:1) dθ = a 2 M 2 , Z π − π ∂ ss z ( 0 , θ ) cos 2 θ dθ = − a 2 M 4 π Z π − π (cid:0) 1 − 4 cos 2 θ (cid:1) cos 2 θ dθ = a 2 M 2 . Finally , diﬀerentiating a third time , we see that ∂ sss z ( s , θ ) = C ( s , θ ) e − aV ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) cos θ , with C ( s , θ ) = ∂ s B ( s , θ ) − B ( s , θ ) a (cid:0) V ′ ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) + V ( s ) ∂ s ρ ( s , θ ) (cid:1) cos θ . We compute ∂ s B ( s , θ ) = ∂ ss A ( s , θ ) − a∂ s A ( s , θ ) (cid:0) V ′ ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) + V ( s ) ∂ s ρ ( s , θ ) (cid:1) cos θ − aA ( s , θ ) (cid:0) V ′′ ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) + 2 V ′ ( s ) ∂ s ρ ( s , θ ) + V ( s ) ∂ ss ρ ( s , θ ) (cid:1) cos θ , 60 and ∂ ss A ( s , θ ) = ∂ sss c 1 ( V , ρ ) − ∂ sss ( aV ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) cos θ ) c 1 ( V , ρ ) − 2 ∂ ss ( aV ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) cos θ ) ∂ s c 1 ( V , ρ ) − ∂ s ( aV ( s ) ( R 0 + ρ ( s , θ ) ) cos θ ) ∂ ss c 1 ( V , ρ ) . Equations ( C . 5 ) , ( C . 7 ) , and ∂ V V V c 1 ( 0 , 0 ) = 0 imply that ∂ s c 1 ( 0 , 0 ) = 0 , ∂ ss c 1 ( 0 , 0 ) = − a 2 M 4 π , ∂ sss c 1 ( 0 , 0 ) = − 3 a 2 M 4 π V ′′ ( 0 ) − 2 M R 3 0 π ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) . Then ∂ ss A ( 0 , θ ) = ∂ sss c 1 ( 0 , 0 ) − ˜ caR 0 cos θV ′′′ ( 0 ) − aR 0 cos θ∂ ss c 1 ( 0 , 0 ) = − 3 a 2 M 4 π V ′′ ( 0 ) − 2 M R 30 π ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) − aM πR 0 cos θV ′′′ ( 0 ) + a 3 R 0 M 4 π cos θ and hence ∂ s B ( 0 , θ ) = − 3 a 2 M 4 π V ′′ ( 0 ) − 2 M R 30 π ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) − aM πR 0 cos θV ′′′ ( 0 ) + a 3 R 0 M 4 π cos θ + aR 0 cos θ (cid:18) a 2 M 4 π + a ˜ cV ′′ ( 0 ) R 0 cos θ (cid:19) + a 2 ˜ cV ′′ ( 0 ) R 20 cos 2 θ = − 3 a 2 M 4 π V ′′ ( 0 ) − aM πR 0 cos θV ′′′ ( 0 ) + a 3 R 0 M 2 π cos θ + 2 a 2 ˜ cV ′′ ( 0 ) R 20 cos 2 θ − 2 M πR 30 ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) . Finally C ( 0 , θ ) = ∂ s B ( 0 , θ ) − B ( 0 , θ ) aR 0 cos θ = − 3 a 2 M 4 π V ′′ ( 0 ) − aM πR 0 cos θV ′′′ ( 0 ) + a 3 R 0 M 2 π cos θ + 2 a 2 ˜ cV ′′ ( 0 ) R 20 cos 2 θ − 2 M πR 30 ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) + aR 0 cos θ (cid:18) a 2 M 4 π (cid:0) 1 − 4 cos 2 θ (cid:1) + a ˜ cV ′′ ( 0 ) R 0 cos θ (cid:19) = 3 a 2 M 4 π V ′′ ( 0 ) (cid:0) 4 cos 2 θ − 1 (cid:1) − aM πR 0 cos θV ′′′ ( 0 ) + R 0 cos θ a 3 M 4 π (cid:0) 3 − 4 cos 2 θ (cid:1) 61 − 2 M πR 30 ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) , and ∂ sss z ( 0 , θ ) = 3 a 2 M 4 π V ′′ ( 0 ) (cid:0) 4 cos 2 θ − 1 (cid:1) − aM πR 0 cos θV ′′′ ( 0 ) + R 0 cos θa 3 M 4 π (cid:0) 3 − 4 cos 2 θ (cid:1) − 2 M πR 30 ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) , Then Z π − π ∂ sss z ( 0 , θ ) cos θ dθ = Z π − π C ( 0 , θ ) cos θ dθ = − aM R 0 V ′′′ ( 0 ) − 2 M πR 30 Z π − π cos θ∂ sss ρ ( 0 , θ ) dθ .
