The rate of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) de - polymerization is proportional to the number of fila - ments depolymerizing and changes in the rate are pro - portional to changes in filament number . To determine the number and length of actin filaments in polymor - phonuclear leukocytes and the change in filament num - ber and length that occurs during the increase in F - actin upon chemoattractant stimulation , the time course of cellular F - actin depolymerization in lysates of control and peptide - stimulated cells was examined . F - actin was quantified by the TRITC - labeled phalloidin staining of pelletable actin . Lysis in 1 . 2 M KCl and 10 14M DNase I minimized the effects of F - actin binding pro - teins and G - actin , respectively , on the kinetics of de - polymerization . To determine filament number and length from a depolymerization time course , depoly - merization kinetics must be limited by the actin mono - HEMOATTRACTANTS induce migration of polymor - phonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs ) ' by stimulating for - mation of lamellipodia . Lamellipodia formation on cells exposed to chemoattractant occurs concomitantly with actin polymerization ( Zigmond and Sullivan , 1979 ; Fech - heimer and Zigmond , 1983 ; Wallace et al . , 1984 ; Howard and Oresajo , 1984a , b ; Rao and Varani , 1982 ) . The actin polymerization is required for lamellipodia extension since cytochalasin , a drug which inhibits actin polymerization , also prevents lamellipodia extension ( White et al . , 1983 ; Cooper , 1987 ; Yahara et al . , 1982 ) . The mechanism through which chemoattractant causes an increase in cellular filamentous actin ( F - actin ) is unclear . The increase could be accomplished by increasing the mono - mer globular actin ( G - actin ) pool available for polymeriza - tion or by increasing the effective affinity of the filament for 1 .

Comparison of time courses of depolymerization in the presence ( pointed ends free ) or absence ( barbed and pointed ends free ) of cytochalasin suggested depolymerization occurred from both ends of the filament and that monomer dissociation was rate limiting . Control cells had 1 . 7 f 0 . 4 x 105 filaments with an average length of 0 . 29 f 0 . 09 um . Chemo - attractant stimulation for 90 s at room temperature with 0 . 02 juM N - formylnorleucylleucylphenylalanine caused a twofold increase in F - actin and about a two - fold increase in the total number of actin filaments to 4 . 0 f 0 . 5 x 105 filaments with an average length of 0 . 27 t 0 . 07 p . m . In both cases , most ( rv80 % ) of the filaments were quite short ( < 0 . 18 Am ) . The length dis - tributions of actin filaments in stimulated and control cells were similar . G - actin . For example , ifthe high - affinity , barbed ends , of the filaments are normally blocked , the G - actin is at steady state with the low - affinity pointed end . Making free barbed ends available would increase the overall affinity of the filaments and stimulate polymerization . Free barbed ends could arise by some combination of removing capping proteins from ex - isting filaments , cutting filaments , or creating new actin oligomers . Finally , changes in accessory proteins that alter either the association or dissociation rates at either end of the filament could shift the F - actin steady state in the cell ( Lal and Kom , 1986 ; Broschat , 1990 ; Broschat et al . , 1989 ; Weigt et al . , 1990 ) . Insight into the mechanism through which chemoattrac - tants regulate F - actin levels might come from knowing whether the increase in F - actin upon addition of chemoat - tractant results from an increase in the length and / or the number of actin filaments . It is difficult to quantify morpho - logically the number and lengths of actin filaments in PMNs since the F - actin is present in a cross - linked actin meshwork in which it is impossible to identify filament ends ( Ryder et 677 al . , 1984 ) . Similar F - actin meshworks have been observed in macrophages and Dictyostelium discoideum ( Hartwig and Shevlin , 1986 ; Hartwig and Yin , 1988 ; Rubino and Small , 1987 ) . It is possible to determine the number and length of linear polymers such as F - actin and microtubules by analyz - ing the time course of depolymerization ( Johnson and Borisy , 1977 ; Karr et al . , 1980 ; Kristofferson et al . , 1980 ; Grazi and Trombetta , 1986 ; and Podolski and Steck , 1990 ) . The relationship between G - and F - actin is described mathe - matically by the following equation : Cells dFá - t - - koff , b Nb [ G ] + ko , P Np [ G ] - koff , b Nb - kor , Np (cid:9) ( 1 ) where F is the total quantity of actin in filaments , k b and ko , , P the association rate constants for the barbed and pointed ends , koff , b and kw , p the dissociation rate constants for the barbed and pointed ends , [ G ] the G - actin concentra - tion , and N b and N p the number ofbarbed and pointed ends . When the concentration of G - actin , [ G ] , in Eq . 1 is small enough such that ( koff , b + kaff , p ) > > ( kon , b + kp ) [ G ] , Eq . 1 becomes : Materials and Methods Materials dF = _ koff , b Nb - koff , p Np (cid:9) ( 2 ) át and the depolymerization rate is proportional to the number of filament ends . A change in rate then provides a measure ofthe change in filament number . As filaments depolymerize completely , the number of filaments decreases and therefore the depolymerization rate decreases . Since actin depolymer - izes at aconstant rate ( length / time ) the change in the filament number as a function of time is equal to the change in the filament number as a function of filament length . The depo - lymerization time course can thus be used to determine the number of filaments of various lengths , the filament length distribution . We have used the kinetics of F - actin depolymerization in PMN lysates to determine the filament length distribution in PMNs . This kinetic approach required that the depolymer - ization rate not be limited by G - actin , filament - capping pro - teins , and / or filament - binding factors . We have established conditions that meet these requirements for - 70 % of the F - actin , and used these conditions to examine the effect of chemoattractant stimulation on the filament length distri - bution . Phalloidin , TRITC - labeled phalloidin ( TRITC - phalloidin ) , cytochalasin D , deoxyribonuclease I ( DNase 1 , type II , from bovine pancreas chro - matographically purified ) , klycerophosphate , Hepes , ATP , NP - 40 , pro - tease inhibitors ( leupeptin , benzamidine , TAME - HCl , aprotonin , and PMSF ) and N - formylnorleucylleucylphenylalanine ( fNLLP ) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company ( St . Louis , MO ) . Rabbit peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes from a 4 - h exudate in - duced with shellfish glycogen were obtained as previously described ( Zig - mond and Sullivan , 1979 ) . The cells were washed twice with saline ( 0 . 9 % ) and suspended in cell buffer : HBSS without Cal * , Mg " , bicarbonate , and phenol red ( Gibco Laboratories , Grand Island , N . Y . ) and with 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 . Stimulated cells were incubated at room temperature with The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 115 , 1991 0 . 02 pM of the chemoattractant fNLLP for 90 s unless otherwise stated . Control experiments showed that under these conditions the F - actin level peaks between 15 and 30 s and remains elevated and stable for - 150 s . Cells were lysed at room temperature by mixing equal volumes of cells in cell buffer with 2x lysis buffer . Lysis buffer ( 1 x final concentrations ) contained 2 MM MgC12 , 5 mM EGTA , 1 . 2 M KCI , 1 % NP - 40 , 2 mM KP04 buffer , 10 mM 0 - glycerophosphate , 10 mM Hepes , 5 mM ATP , and protease inhib - itors ( 1 pg / ml leupeptin , 1 14g / ml benzamidine , 10 lAg / ml TAME - HCI , and 10 Ag / ml aprotonin added from a IOOX stock ; and 1 mM PMSF added just before lysis ) . When noted the lysis buffer was modified by varying KCI con - centration ( final KCI concentrations are given ) , by including 10 pM DNase I to bind G - actin , or by leaving out NP - 40 . Unless otherwise noted , the final cell concentration in the lysate was 2 x 106 cells / ml and each sample con - tained 5 x 106 total cells . F - actin in the Cell Lysate F - actin in the cell lysate was quantified by extending the method of Howard and Oresajo ( 1985b ) using TRITC - phalloidin present at 0 . 6 , UM . Since 106 cells contains - 0 . 13 nmole of actin ( White et al . , 1983 ) , even if all ofthe cell actin in the lysate were polymerized ( 2 x 106 cells / ml = 0 . 26 ; AM ) , the amount of TRITC - phalloidin would be present in a 2 . 3 - fold molar ex - cess of the amount of F - actin . This concentration of TRITC - phalloidin sta - bilized F - actin and prevented depolymerization even in the presence of DNase I . Cell lysates ( 2 x 106 cells / nil , 5 x 106 cells / sample ) were in - cubated for at least 60 min in TRITC - phalloidin . The samples were spun for 15 min at 80 , 000 rpm in the 100 . 3 rotor at 4°C in a TL - 100 tabletop ultracentrifuge ( Beckman Instruments , Inc . , Palo Alto , CA ) ( 346 , 000 g ) . Ultracentrifuge spins ofcell lysates at 80 , 000 rpm for up to 60 min caused no F - actin pelleting beyond that observed with a 15 - min spin . The superna - tant was removed and the pellet was extracted for24 to 48 h in 1 ml of meth - anol . The fluorescencewas read in a fluorescence spectrophotometer ( LS - 5 ; Perkin Elmer Corp . , Norwalk , CT ) ( excitation 540 run / emission 575 run ) . Under these conditions the TRITC staining was proportional to the amount of F - actin . Nonsaturable staining ( staining in the presence of 6 - , UM unla - beled phalloidin ; between 10 and 20 % of total stain ) was subtracted from all data . G - actin in the Cell Lysate Cells were lysed with 1 ml oflysis buffer containing 0 . 6 M KCI ( final con - centration ) at 5 x 106 cells / ml . The lysate was immediately diluted 1 : 8 ( to - 6 x 105 cells / ml ) with lysis buffer without NP - 40 since high concentra - tions ofNP - 40interfered with theDNase inhibition assay . At various times , the F - actin remaining was stabilized by adding 0 . 6 pM TRITC - phalloidin . The samples were spun 2 . 5 h at 30 , 000 rpm ( 81 , 000 g in Type 40 rotor ) in an ultracentrifuge ( L8 - 80M ; Beckman Instruments , Inc . ) . The superna - tant was saved and assayed for G - actin by DNase inhibition ( Blikstad et al . , 1978 ) . DNase I was stored frozen at a concentration of 1 mg / ml in 500 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 0 . 1 mM PMSF , and 1 mM CaC12 , The DNase I was diluted 1 : 100with glass - distilled water immediately before use . Calfthymus DNA ( type I ; Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) was prepared in 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 4 mM MGSO4 , and 1 . 8 mM CaC12 at - 200 pg / ml and diluted 1 : 5 before use . The activity of the DNase was determined by mixing 50 pl ofthe DNase solution with an appropriate volume of the supernatant between 50 and 100 td ) to cause - 50 % inhibition of DNase and 1 ml of the DNA solution at room temperature . The change inopticaldensity at 285 nm was recorded in a spectrophotometer ( model 25a ; Beckman Instru - ments , Inc . ) . Under these conditions , the decrease in DNase activity was shown to be proportional to the amount of G - actin present . F - actin Quantitation on Gels Stimulated cell lysates were processed as described in the Materials and Methods for F - actin in the cell lysate . The high speed pellets containing F - actin were analyzed by SDS - PAGE according to the methods of Laemmli ( 1970 ) . The gels were stained with Coomassie blue . Actin bands on the gels were quantified with an Image One image analysis system ( Universal Imag - ing Corporation , West Chester , PA ) . Determination ofActin Association and Dissociation Rate Constants Pyrene actin polymerization and depolymerization were used to measure actin association and dissociation rate constants under our conditions . Pyrene - labeled rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared as previously de - 678 scribed ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ; Northrop et al . , 1986 ; Carson et al . , 1986 ) . Pyrene actin ( 2 . 0 AM ) was polymerized overnight in 0 . 14 M KCI , 2 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM ATP , 25 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 1 mM EGTA , and 0 . 2 % NP - 40 . To estimate rate constants from polymerization and depoly - merization time courses , the filament number must be known . To determine the filament number present inour assay , a standard curve of elongation rate as a function of filament number was developed using villin - nucleated py - rene actin filaments as follows : Pyrene actin ( 2 . 0 AM ) was polymerized overnight in the presence of 20 nM villin in 2 MM M9Clz , 0 . 14 M KCI , 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 1 mM ATP , and 0 . 2 mM CaCIZ to make villin - capped actin filaments . The concentration offilaments was taken to be equal to the concentration of villin ( Northrop et al . , 1986 ) . Aliquots ( 10 - 50 Al ) ofvillin - capped actin filaments wereadded to lysis buffercontaining 0 . 15 M KCI with 1 . 0 AM pyrene G - actin . Since lysis buffer contains EGTA , the vil - lin cap comes offof the filaments and the pyrene G - actin polymerizes rap - idly on the free barbed ends . The initial fluorescence increase ( excitation 370 / emission 410 ) , the initial elongation rate , was measured for different filament numbers added . This standard curve was then used to determine the number of filaments created when 50 Al of previously polymerized 2 . 0 AM pyrene actin is added ( with a 50 - Al Hamilton syringe ) to 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0 . 15 M KCI and LOAMpyreneG - actin . The initial elonga - tion rate is proportional to the number of filaments added . The dissociation rate constant ( barbed and pointed ends together ) was measured by using a 50 Al Hamilton syringe to dilute 2 . 0 AM ofpreviously polymerized pyrene actin to 0 . 1 pM in 1 ml oflysis buffer containing 0 . 15 M KCI without DNase 1 . The initial slope of the decrease in pyrene fluores - cence ( excitation 370 / emission 410 ) and the filament concentration ( deter - mined from the standard curve ) were used to estimate the dissociation rate constant in this buffer . By comparing the depolymerization of equal num - bers of pyrene - labeled actin filaments in lysis buffer containing 0 . 15 or 1 . 2 M KCI , the actin dissociation rate constant in lysis buffer containing 1 . 2 M KCI was estimated . Since the dissociation rate constant in 0 . 15 M KCI was 2 . 5 s - 1 for the barbed and pointed ends together , and the depoly - merization rate increased by 1 . 7 - fold because ofthe presence of 1 . 2 M KCI , the dissociation rate constant from both ends together in lysis buffer con - taining 1 . 2 M KCI was 4 . 2 s - r . The presence of 1 . 2 M KCI and 10 AM DNase I increased this rate an additional 1 . 5 - fold , so the dissociation rate constant under our experimental lysis conditions was 6 . 3 s - 1 . Control ex - periments showed that DNase I did not sever F - actin because it increased the depolymerization rate by the same amount for long and short filaments . Severing would result in a greater increase in depolymerization rate for longer filaments . The association rate constant ( barbed and pointed ends together ) was measuredby using a 50 Al Hamilton syringeto add 50 Al ofpreviously poly - merized 2 . 0 AM pyrene actin to 1 ml of lysis buffer containing Q6 M KCI and 2 . 0 AM pyrene G - actin . The initial slope of the increase in pyrene fluorescence ( excitation 370 / emission 410 ) and the filament concentration ( determined from the standard curve ) were used to estimate the association rate constant in this buffer . Therefore , under the conditions used for the elongation experiments ( 0 . 6 M KCI ) , the association rate constant was 0 . 9 AM - 1 S - 1 . Assayfor Number ofElongation Sites The number offilament - barbed ends in cell lysates was estimated indepen - dently by following their ability to nucleate pyrene actin polymerization in a cytochalasin sensitive manner . Assays were performed as described previ - ously ( Carson et al . , 1986 ) with the following modifications . Cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 0 . 6 M KCI at 106 cells / ml in a 1 - ml cuvette . At various times after lysis , a final concentration of2 . 0 FPM pyrene actin was added to the sample from a stock solution of 8 - 15 AM . The initial rate of fluorescence increase at room temperature was measured and used as an indicator of the relative number ofactin elongation sites present . The absolute number was calculated by converting the change in fluorescence into a change in concentration of F - actin and using the association rate con - stant , 0 . 9 AM - 1 s - 1 , measured under these conditions ( see above ) . Results The Cell F - actin Depolymerization 7ime Course Can be Followed by Decreases in the Pelletable TRITC - Phalloidin In preliminary experiments , we found that after lysis in Cano et al . Stimulation Increases Actin Filament Number in PMNs buffer containing 0 . 15 M KCI and 10 AM DNase I ( to bind up G - actin ) , only - 30 % of the cell F - actin depolymerized in 5 min and only - 50 % depolymerized even after 18 h . This concentration ofDNase was - 100 - fold in excess of the G - actin concentration which we estimate to be - 0 . 1 FPM in the lysate ( as measured by DNase inhibition ) ; thus the pres - ence of G - actin was not likely to be limiting depolymeriza - tion . Increasing the KCI to 0 . 6 and 1 . 2 M KCI allowed a larger fraction of the cellular F - actin to depolymerize , 50 and 70 % in 5 min , respectively . Since we wanted to analyze as large a fraction of the cellular F - actin as possible , we per - formed subsequent experiments in high KCl . Cells were lysed in buffer containing 0 . 6 M KCI and 10 AM DNase 1 ; at various times TRITC - phalloidin was added to stop further depolymerization and to stain the F - actin pres - ent . The F - actin was pelleted at high speed and the TRITC - phalloidin extracted from the pellet served as a mea - sure of the F - actin . As seen in Fig . 1 a there was a rapid phase of F - actin loss in which - 50 % of the pelletable TRITC - phalloidin was lost in two minutes and a slow phase in which an additional 30 % of the TRITC - phalloidin was lost over the subsequent 18 h . The validity of the TRITC - phalloidin pelleting assay for F - actin was confirmed by measuring the G - actin released into the supernatant with a DNase inhibition assay ( Blikstad et al . , 1978 ) . This depolymerization time course was ob - tained by lysing cells at high dilution ( - 6 x 1 ( Y cells / ml ) since we could not use DNase I in this experiment to lower the G - actin concentration . Fig . 1 b shows the increases in G - actin over time for cells lysed in buffer containing 0 . 6 M KCI . A rapid increase in G - actin during the first two minutes was followed by a more gradual increase up to three hours . Allowing the samples to depolymerize overnight resulted in a slightly greater increase in G - actin . Comparison of Fig . 1 , a and b indicates that decreases in F - actin were accompanied by corresponding increases in G - actin suggesting that the de - crease in TRITC - phalloidin staining does reflect F - actin de - polymerization . The actin present in the high speed pellets at various times after lysis in 0 . 6 M KCI and 10 AM DNase was also quantified by scanning the actin band on Coomassie blue - stained SDS gels . Gel scans showed 64 , 45 , and 34 % of the initial actin band present 1 , 5 , and 60 min after lysis of stimu - lated cells in buffer containing 0 . 6 M KCI . A TRITC - phal - loidin pelleting assay of parallel tubes showed 68 , 43 , and 29 % ofthe initial values present at these times . Thus , the de - polymerization time course followed by SDS gel analysis also correlated well with the time course followed by loss in TRITC - phalloidin staining . Cytochalasin D Has Similar Effects on the Depolymerization Kinetics ofCellular F - actin and FreeActin Filaments To predict the filament length distribution from a depolymer - ization time course , the depolymerization kinetics must be limited by the monomer dissociation rate and not by the dis - sociation rate of accessory factors that bind to the filament and inhibit depolymerization . To test whether this was the case for the cell actin , we compared the depolymerization ki - netics of cell actin with those of pure F - actin in the presence and absence of cytochalasin D ( CD ) . Because CD inhibits depolymerization selectively from the barbed end , the depo - 679 c U cts 0 50 100 150 time ( min ) lymerization time course of pure F - actin in the presence of CD is due primarily to depolymerization from the pointed ends offilaments , while the depolymerization time course in the absence of CD is a result of depolymerization from both the barbed and pointed ends of filaments . For pure actin , free at both ends ( Nb = Np = N ) , the ra - tio of the depolymerization rates with and without CD is a constant independent of filament number : dF ( with CD ) (cid:9) koff , N (cid:9) kotr , a (cid:9) ( 3 ) dF (cid:9) ( koff , b + koff , p ) N (cid:9) koff , b + koff , p at ( without CD ) The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 115 , 1991 F - actin vs .

In contrast , this ratio would increase if some of the barbed ends of the cell F - actin were capped . An increase would also occur if the rate of de - polymerization were slowed by some accessory protein , ( if the slowing by the accessory factor were minor , its effect would be most apparent on the barbed end kinetics and would increase the ratio ; if the accessory factor so slowed the rate that depolymerization was then limited by the off rate of the factor itself , the ratio would be increased to one ) . The ratio would be decreased only by accessory factors that selectively blocked the pointed end ( so far no such factors have been convincingly described ) or that increased the de - polymerization rate at the barbed end over that of free actin ( the opposite of our in vitro results ) .

Quantitatively similar results were obtained when chemo - attractant stimulated cells were lysed in the presence and ab - sence of CD ( not shown ) . These observations suggest that under these lysis conditions , about 70 % of the F - actin from stimulated and control cells depolymerizes as free actin fila - ments .

Cell F - actin Depolymerization Curvesfor Control and Chemoattractant Stimulated Cells Fig . 3 shows the depolymerization time courses for the cell actin in lysates ( 1 . 2 M KCl and 10 , uM DNase I ) from control cells and from cells stimulated at room temperature with 0 . 02 p .

On the average , stimulation caused a twofold increase in the amount of F - actin when compared to resting cells in the same experiment . Stimulation also resulted in an increase in the initial rate ofdepolymerization . In stimulated cells there was an increase in the amount of F - actin that rapidly de - polymerized as well as an increase in the amount ofactin that did not depolymerize even after 60 min under these lysis conditions . For both control and stimulated lysates , there was a rapid initial rate of depolymerization that slowed significantly after 2 to 5 min .

From the slopes of the de - polymerization time courses ( in units of monomers / s ) and the dissociation rate constants measured under our ex - perimental conditions , it is possible to calculate the number of filaments , N , depolymerizing . To evaluate the slope , the fluorescence data must be converted to the amount of actin in filaments . There is - 0 . 13 nmole of actin in 106 cells ; be - tween 30 and 50 % of this actin in a resting cell is F - actin ( White et al . , 1983 ) . Assuming 40 % of the actin in resting cells is F - actin , we estimated that the fluorescence at time zero for control cells ( 100 % on the figures ) is due to 3 . 1 x 10 ' actin molecules / cell in filaments .

The dissociation rate constant for the barbed and pointed ends depolymerizing together in our lysis buffer , ( k . r , b + koff , p ) , was estimated to be 6 . 3 s - l ( see Materials and Methods ) . The initial slope of the depolymerization time course is proportional to the number of actin filaments exhibiting de - polymerization at the time oflysis .

Stimulation Increases Actin Filament Number in PMNs (cid:9) 683 tion resulted in a faster initial rate of depolymerization and thus an increase in the number of actin filaments exhibiting depolymerization . The initial rate of depolymerization of stimulated cells was also faster than control cells when as - sayed in lysis buffer containing 0 . 2 IX CD indicating an in - crease in the number ofpointed ends . From the initial slopes ofFig . 3 and the rate constant described above , we estimated that resting PMNs had 1 . 7 f 0 . 4 x 105 filaments / cell while stimulation with chemoattractant for 90 s increased the ini - tial rate by 2 . 4x and thus , increased the filament number to 4 . 0 f 0 . 5 x 105 filaments / cell ( Fig . 4 ) . To analyze the data for a filament length distribution , the depolymerization time courses were approximated by a se - ries of straight lines using least squares analysis ( Fig . 5 , in - set ) . We included the maximum number of points per line segment such that the correlation coefficient for each seg - ment was > 0 . 9 . By applying Eq . 4 , we calculated filament number as a function oftime . The change in rate represented a loss of filaments because of complete depolymerization , thus the length of the filaments lost is defined by the dissocia - tion rate constant multiplied by the time it took for them to depolymerize .

The distributions are very simi - lar . In both cases - 80 % of the filaments appear to be quite short ( < 0 . 18 Am ) . The average filament length for control cells is 0 . 29 t 0 . 09 Am and the average for stimulated cells is 0 . 27 t 0 . 07 A . m . The fifth ( longest ) length population was not included in the average length calculation because it reflects interference from the pool that does not depolymer - ize . Fig . 6 is a plot of the actin mass distribution in the first four length classes that were defined in Fig . 5 . Most of the actin mass is found in the short filaments . This analysis ofdepolymerization time courses in terms of filament length distributions assumes that the slowing of the time course is because of the progressive loss of filaments . To verify this assumption , we examined the loss of elonga - tion sites for actin polymerization ( presumably barbed ends of filaments since addition of CD completely inhibited elon - gation ) during the depolymerization time course . 2 . 0 AM py - rene - labeled G - actin was added to lysates at various times during the depolymerization time course . The initial in - crease in fluorescence ( i . e . , the initial rate of polymeriza - tion ) was taken to be proportional to the number of actin elongation sites present . From the initial rates of polymer - ization due to control or stimulated cells lysed into buffer containing 0 . 6 M KCl and 2 . 0 AM pyrene - labeled G - actin , we estimated that there were 1 . 7 x 105 elongation sites / control cell and 2 . 7 x 105 elongation sites / stimulated cell . Fig . 7 shows the loss of actin elongation sites during depoly - merization of the actin from control cells in lysis buffer con - taining 0 . 6 M KCl ( turbidity of the samples made it impossi - ble to perform this assay in 1 . 2 M KCI ) . Similar results were The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 115 , 1991 C ] Unstimulated Stimulated Discussion 684 Figure 6 . Actin mass distribu - tion for depolymerizable actin in stimulated andunstimulated cells . The data of Fig . 5 were used to calculate a distribution ofthe percent actin mass found in each ofthe first fourdiscrete filament length populations . obtained for stimulated cells ( not shown ) . The loss in elon - gation sites occurs over the same time course as the decrease in filament number from the depolymerization data thus sup - porting the assumption that the depolymerization time course reflects a progressive loss of actin filaments . Previous studies have shown that chemoattractant stimula - tion causes a twofold increase in the F - actin content of PMNs . We have now used a kinetic analysis to show that a twofold increase in the number of actin filaments accompa - nies the twofold increase in F - actin . The rate ofF - actin depo - lymerization in both the presence and absence of CD was faster in stimulated than unstimulated cells . This observation only rules out the possibility that the chemoattractant - induced increase in F - actin is merely a result of the removal of barbed end - capping proteins and subsequent elongation from these new ends . We estimated that resting cells had about 1 . 7 f 0 . 4 x 105 filaments with average length 0 . 29 f 0 . 09 Am while stimulated cells had 4 . 0 f 0 . 5 x 105 fila - ments with average length 0 . 27 f 0 . 07 Am . Most ( ti80 % ) of the filaments in both stimulated and control cells were quite short ( - 0 . 18 Am ) . The shape of the filament length dis - tribution was similar in stimulated and control cells . An increase in the filament number of chemoattractant stimulated cells is consistent with earlier observations that chemoattractant stimulation increased the number of actin elongation sites in cell lysates ( Carson et al . , 1986 ; Howard et al . , 1990 ) . Carson et al . ( working at 37°C ) showed that elongation sites doubled upon stimulation with chemoattrac - ó 60 CD c 0LJ ° 40 a > E 0 100 80 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 time ( min ) tant , peaking at - 10 s and then declining . In the current study ( working at room temperature ) , we find about a 1 . 6 - fold increase in elongation sites after 90 s . This difference is due in part to the different temperatures of the experi - ments ; at 37°C the elongation activity and the F - actin level rise and decline rapidly while at room temperature both rise and fall more slowly . Since the elongation sites could have arisen from the cutting or uncapping ofexisting filaments or from de novo sites , we could not predict from the earlier study ( Carson et al . , 1986 ) whether filament number or length , or both , were increased by addition of chemoattrac - tant . The increase in filament number suggested by our ki - netic data could be explained by severing of existing fila - ments or by creation of new filaments from de novo nucleation sites . The simple removal of a capping protein from existing filaments would not lead to an increase in fila - ment number . However , the new elongation sites could result from the uncapping of small actin oligomers that are too small to pellet and thus be counted as filaments . Small oligomers are reported to be released from gelsolin - actin complexes upon chemoattractant stimulation ( Howard et al . , 1990 ) . To interpret the depolymerization time course of cellular F - actin in terms ofa filament length distribution , it is critical to know if the depolymerization of cellular F - actin is limited by the actin dissociation constants under the conditions of the assays . To eliminate effects of G - actin on the kinetics ( as in Eq . 2 ) we included 10 AM DNase I to bind actin monomers . This was preferable to dilution of samples to de - crease G - actin concentration since after extensive dilution , the data became very noisy ( presumably from adsorption of TRITC - phalloidin to the large surface area of the tubes ) . While DNase I binds to the pointed ends offilaments ( Podol - ski and Steck , 1990 ) , it does not inhibit depolymerization from the pointed end ( Annemarie Weber , University of Cano et al . Stimulation Increases Actin Filament Number in PMNs 685 3 4 5 60 Figure 7 . Loss of elongation sites for exogenous actin poly - merization during the depoly - merization time course . Ly - sates were prepared from unstimulated cells at 106 cells / ml in lysis buffer containing 0 . 6 M KCI ; at various times , 2 . 0 AM pyrene G - actin was added to the mixture . The ini - tial increase in fluorescence was taken to be proportional to changes in the number ofactin elongation sites present . Data ( mean f SEM of two experi - ments ) are plotted as percent elongation rate relative to the elongation rate found by lys - ing cells directly into buffer containing 2 . 0 AM pyrene G - actin . Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA personal communication ) . By comparing the effect of DNase I on long and short actin filaments , Dr . Weber has shown that DNase I increases the rate ofdepolymerization from the pointed end of the filament by increasing the dissociation rate constant and not by sever - ing the filaments . We confirmed these results in our labora - tory . In the presence of protease inhibitors , we saw that 10 / AM DNase I slightly increased ( ti1 . 5 x ) the rate of pyrene actin depolymerization . Since both control and stimulated lysates were treated similarly , the relative change in filament number upon stimulation is notaffected by the particular rate constant used . In 1 . 2 M KCl and 10 AM DNase 1 , - 70 % of the F - actin depolymerized in 5 min ( Fig . 3 ) . The kinetics with and with - out cytochalasin D ( Fig . 2 ) suggest that this actin depolymer - ized similarly to free filaments , i . e . , not limited by other fac - tors such as cross - linking or capping proteins . The high KCI probably helps remove salt - sensitive actin - binding proteins that inhibit the rate and extent of depolymerization . For ex - ample , acumentin , tropomyosin , and actin - binding protein dissociate from actin in the presence ofhigh salt ( Southwick and Stossel , 1981 ; Southwick et al - . , 1982 ; Maekawa et al . , 1989 ; Broschat and Burgess , 1986 ; Rosenburg et al . , 1981 ) . Changes in the slope of the depolymerization time course ( Fig . 3 ) could be due to losses of entire filaments via depoly - merization ( Fig . 8 B ) or to filaments whose depolymeriza - tion becomes blocked by associated factors ( Fig . 8 A ) . The loss ofelongation sites over the time course ofdepolymeriza - tion ( Fig . 7 ) suggests that filament ends are disappearing as the actin depolymerizes . The depolymerization time course data suggest that 90 % of the filaments disappear after 5 min while the elongation experiments suggest that only 70 % of the filaments disappear after 5 min . This difference is not due to the fact that the elongation experiments were performed in 0 . 6 M KCI while the depolymerization experiments were Figure 8 . Schematic represen - tation of possible models of the F - actin in polymorpho - nuclear leukocytes . Cellular F - actin may be in one of two simple forms . ( A ) Actin fila - ments may be partially associ - ated with factors ( n . ) that can block depolymerization . Un der our lysis conditions , the F - actin would depolymerize until a block was reached . ( B ) Or there may be two classes of actin fila - ments . Under our lysis conditions one class would completely depolymerize , while the other class would not depolymerize be - cause it is blocked by filament associated factors ( m ) . performed in 1 . 2 M KCl since analysis of depolymerization kinetics in 0 . 6 M KCl also shows a loss of - 90 % of the fila - ments in 5 min ( unpublished data ) . The residual 20 % of the elongation activity is probably due to free ends of filaments present in the 30 % of the F - actin that does not depolymerize . Our filament numbers and lengths are estimated from the 70 % of the F - actin that has depolymerized in 5 min . The re - sidual 30 % of the actin could affect the estimated filament length distribution . One possibility , suggested above , is that our calculated distribution accounts for depolymerizable ends of filaments that are inhibited from complete depoly - merization ( Fig . 8A ) . Were this the case , we would have cor - rectly estimated the filament number but underestimated filament length by - 30 % . It is also possible that the residual 30 % of the F - actin in 1 . 2 M KCl represents additional sepa - rate filaments ( Fig . 8 B ) . Were this the case we would have underestimated the filament number by about 20 % ( the re - sidual elongation sites ) . Since 20 % ofthe elongation sites re - main while 30 % of the total F - actin remains , this residual F - actin would be expected to have a similar , but slightly longer filament length distribution , than the rest of the fila - ments . Our analysis reduced the filament distribution to five dis - crete filament length classes . The true filament length distri - bution is likely to be continuous . A nonlinear least squares routine was used to fit some continuous functions ( for exam - ple , a sum ofexponentials or a sum of error functions ) to the depolymerization data ( not shown ) . By taking the first derivative of these functions , we were able to obtain smooth curves that would represent the number of filaments versus time . The rate ofchange of these curves was then used to cal - culate continuous distributions . We found the predicted con - tinuous length distributions were quite sensitive to the func - tion chosen for curve fitting , especially in the small filament range . However , curve fitting interpolated our data beyond its resolution , especially at short times where we were unable to distinguish which fit was better and there was no compel - ling reason why either should be applied . If filaments were pooled into discrete classes we obtained the same general re - sult as the division ofF - actin into discrete length populations ( many small filaments , some intermediate filaments , and few long filaments both in stimulated and control cells ) . There - fore , we have chosen to reportour results in terms ofdiscrete length populations . Our data suggest that there are a very large number of short filaments present within stimulated and unstimulated PMNs . It is not possible to measure filament lengths in elec - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 115 , 1991 tron micrographs of PMNs ( Ryder et al . , 1984 ) because of the difficulty in resolving free filament ends ( i . e . , do fila - ments cross over or terminate at the intersections ) . Similar actin meshworks have been observed in macrophages and Dictyostelium discoideum ( Hartwig and Shevlin , 1986 ; Hartwig and Yin , 1988 ; Rubino and Small , 1987 ) . Hartwig and Shevlin ( 1986 ) measured the distance between filament intersections in macrophages ( N0 . 1 p , m ) but also were un - able to morphometrically measure the end - to - end length of individual filaments . In D . discoideum the majority of filaments measured morphologically were approximately 0 . 1 - tm long ( Rubino and Small , 1987 ) . All of the electron microscopic observations are compatible with our estimates of the filament lengths from kinetic data . The time course ofthe F - actin depolymerization in lysates has been used to estimate the actin filament length distribu - tion of unstimulated D . discoideum ( Podolski and Steck , 1990 ) . The data suggested about 3 . 6 x 105 filamentslDictyo - stelium with an average length of 0 . 2 gm and the existence of a very large population of small filaments ( 0 . 14 / Am ) . In that analysis , it was not clear whether 100 % of the F - actin depolymerized ; nor was there any evidence showing the de - polymerization kinetics were not affected by filament associ - ated factors . Nevertheless , the filament number and distribu - tion obtained for unstimulated Dictyostefum amoeba were similar to ours for unstimulated PMNs . In summary , stimulation with chemoattractant appears to increase F - actin levels in PMNs by increasing the filament number while keeping the filament length distribution quite constant . The fact that the filament length distribution does not change upon stimulation suggests that this distribution is similar in the lamellipodia and the cortex since most of the F - actin induced by chemoattractant is in the lamellipodia . Thus the increased lability oflamellar F - actin relative to cor - tical F - actin that has been observed in vivo ( Cassimeris et al . , 1990 ) is not likely to be because of a difference in the filament lengths . The functional significance and molecular basis for creating the filament length distribution requires further study .
