A . 2 Institut fu¨r Angewandte Mikrobiologie , Biozentrum , Universita¨t Basel , CH - 4056 Basel , Switzerland An important recent advance in the functional analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes is the development of the one - step PCR - mediated technique for deletion and modiﬁcation of chromosomal genes . This method allows very rapid gene manipulations without requiring plasmid clones of the gene of interest . We describe here a new set of plasmids that serve as templates for the PCR synthesis of fragments that allow a variety of gene modiﬁcations . Using as selectable marker the S . cerevisiae TRP1 gene or modules containing the heterologous Schizosaccharomyces pombe his5 + or Escherichia coli kan r gene , these plasmids allow gene deletion , gene overexpression ( using the regulatable GAL1 promoter ) , C - or N - terminal protein tagging [ with GFP ( S65T ) , GST , or the 3HA or 13Myc epitope ] , and partial N - or C - terminal deletions ( with or without concomitant protein tagging ) . Because of the modular nature of the plasmids , they allow e Y cient and economical use of a small number of PCR primers for a wide variety of gene manipulations . Thus , these plasmids should further facilitate the rapid analysis of gene function in S . cerevisiae . ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . key words — epitope tagging ; green ﬂuorescent protein ; functional analysis ; overexpression studies ; gene deletion ; gene truncation ; polymerase chain reaction INTRODUCTION In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , gene deletion and the modiﬁcation of chromosomal genes by homologous recombination are now standard techniques . Among the useful gene modiﬁcations are placing a gene under control of a regulatable promoter for overexpression and / or protein - depletion studies and adding sequences encoding protein tags that allow facile protein detection and isolation . Recently , a PCR - mediated technique has been developed that allows single - step deletion and tagging of chromosomal genes ( McElver and Weber , 1992 ; Baudin et al . , 1993 ; Lorenz et al . , 1995 ; Wach et al . , 1994 , 1997 , 1998 ) . In this method , the PCR primers used have 5 * - ends ( 2 40 nucleotides ) that correspond to the desired target gene sequences and 3 * - ends ( 2 20 nucleotides ) that anneal to and allow ampliﬁcation of the selectable marker gene ( and , if included in the template , of sequences encoding a tag ) .

Received 24 December 1997 Accepted 25 February 1998 transformed directly into yeast , and homologous recombinants that carry the deleted or tagged target gene are identiﬁed . The method works best when the selectable marker itself cannot undergo homologous recombination with the host genome , and to this end heterologous marker modules based on the Escherichia coli kan r gene ( which confers resistance to G418 / geneticin : Jiminez and Davies , 1980 ; Hadﬁeld et al . , 1990 ) or the Schizosaccharomyces pombe his5 + gene ( which complements S . cerevisiae his3 mutations ) have been developed ( Wach et al . , 1994 , 1997 ) . Tagging of a protein has many uses . The Aequorea victoria green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) is proving to be invaluable for localizing proteins in both living and ﬁxed cells ( Prasher , 1995 ; Heim and Tsien , 1996 ; Niedenthal et al . , 1996 ) , and both the inﬂuenza virus hemagglutinin ( HA ) epitope ( Field et al . , 1988 ; Tyers et al . , 1993 ) and the c - myc - encoded Myc epitope ( Evan et al . , 1985 ; Munro and Pelham , 1987 ) have been widely used both for protein localization by immuno - ﬂuorescence and for the biochemical detection and isolation of proteins . The Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) ( Smith et al . , 1986 ) is another useful protein tag that allows both the localization of proteins by immunoﬂuorescence ( Bi and Pringle , 1996 ; Longtine et al . , 1998 ) and the rapid , one - step biochemical puriﬁcation of both the tagged protein and associated proteins using glutathione - conjugated agarose beads ( Smith and Johnson , 1988 ; Ausubel et al . , 1995 ) . In this paper , we describe a set of plasmids that extend the range of the PCR - mediated gene - modiﬁcation method in several ways . These plasmids allow a small number of PCR primers to be used for a wide variety of gene manipulations . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains , growth conditions , and DNA methods All S . cerevisiae strains were derived from YEF473 ( a / Æ ura3 – 52 / ura3 – 52 his3 ˜ - 200 / his3 ˜ - 200 trp1 ˜ - 63 / trp1 ˜ - 63 leu2 ˜ - 1 / leu2 ˜ - 1 lys2 – 801 / lys2 – 801 ) ( Bi and Pringle , 1996 ) . Yeast were grown at 30 ) C on YP solid medium , synthetic complete ( SC ) liquid or solid medium , or YM - P rich liquid medium ( Lillie and Pringle , 1980 ; Guthrie and Fink , 1991 ) containing 2 % dextrose , 1 % ra Y nose , or 1 % ra Y nose plus various concentrations of galactose ( as indicated ) . YPD - G418 plates con - tained YP medium with 2 % dextrose and 200 (cid:236) g / ml G418 ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) . E . coli strain DH12S ( Life Technologies ) and standard media and methods ( Ausubel et al . , 1995 ) were used for plasmid manipulations . Yeast genomic DNA was isolated according to the method of Ho V man and Winston ( 1987 ) . Plasmid DNA was isolated from E . coli and from agarose gels using Qiagen kits ( Qiagen , Santa Clarita , CA ) . Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies ( Coralville , IA ) . Yeastmaker DNA ( Clontech Laboratories , Palo Alto , CA ) was used as carrier DNA in yeast transformations . DNA for plasmid constructions and yeast transformation was generated by PCR using the Expand system ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) and HotStart 100 tubes ( Molecular Bio - Products , San Diego , CA ) . The lower mix ( ﬁnal volume , 25 (cid:236) l ) contained 2·5 (cid:236) l of Expand bu V er with 17·5 m m - MgCl 2 , 0·8 m m of each dNTP , 10 (cid:236) g of BSA , and 2 (cid:236) m of each primer .

PCR screening of transformants for integration by homologous recombination was done in 50 (cid:236) l reactions containing 2 (cid:236) m of each primer , 2 m m MgSO 4 , 5 (cid:236) g of BSA , 0·2 m m of each dNTP , 0·5 (cid:236) l ( 2·5 units ) of Taq DNA polymerase ( Promega , Madison , WI ) , and 1 (cid:236) l ( 2 0·5 (cid:236) g ) of yeast genomic DNA . PCR reactions were run for 36 cycles of 1 min at 94 ) C , 1 min at 55 ) C , and 1 min / kb of the desired product at 72 ) C ; the 36 cycles were followed by a 10 - min extension at 72 ) C . Plasmid constructions Plasmids pFA6a - kanMX6 , pFA6a - His3MX6 , pFA6a - GFP ( S65T ) - kanMX6 , and pFA6a - GFP ( S65T ) - HIS3MX6 have been described by Wach et al .

Other plasmids ( Figure 1 ) were constructed as follows ; in these descriptions , italics in oligo - nucleotide primer sequences indicate a restriction enzyme site , underlining indicates the complement of a stop codon , and bold face indicates the complement of a start codon . Sequencing of all PCR products immediately after their initial cloning identiﬁed no mutations resulting from the PCR ( except in the case of the 13Myc sequences ; see below ) , and sequencing of insert junctions conﬁrmed the preservation of the desired reading frames ( where relevant ) . To construct plasmid pFA6a - TRP1 , the 2 920 - bp PCR product obtained using pRS304 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) as template , forward primer 5 * - AAA AGATCT GTACAATCTTGATC CGGAGC - 3 * , and reverse primer 5 * - AAA GTTT AAAC CTCCTTACGCATCTGTGCGG - 3 * was digested with Bgl II and Pme I and ligated into Bgl II / Pme I - digested pFA6a - kanMX6 , thus replac - ing the kanMX6 module with the S . cerevisiae TRP1 gene . To construct plasmid pFA6a - GFP ( S65T ) - TRP1 , the Bgl II - Pme I fragment con - taining TRP1 from pFA6a - TRP1 was ligated into Bgl II / Pme I - digested pFA6a - GFP ( S65T ) - kanMX6 , thus replacing the kanMX6 module with TRP1 . To construct plasmid pFA6a - 3HA - kanMX6 , the PCR product obtained using pGTEP ( see above ) as template , forward primer 5 * - AAAA TTAATTAA CATCTTTTACCCATACGATGTTCCT - 3 * , and reverse primer 5 * - AAAA GGCGCGCC TCAG CACTGAGCAGCGTAATCTGGAAC - 3 * was digested with Pac I and Asc I and ligated into P ac I / Asc I - digested pFA6a - GFP ( S65T ) - kanMX6 , thus replacing GFP ( S65T ) with a 125 - bp fragment encoding a 3HA epitope followed by a stop codon introduced by the primer . Plasmids pFA6a - 3HA - TRP1 and pFA6a - 3HA - His3MX6 were then created by digesting pFA6a - 3HA - kanMX6 with Bgl II and Pme I and ligating in the correspond - ing fragments from pFA6a - TRP1 and pFA6a - His3MX6 , respectively . To construct plasmid pFA6a - 13Myc - kanMX6 , the PCR product obtained using pCR2 . 1 15X Myc ( see above ) as template , forward primer 5 * - AAAA AA TTAATTAA CGGTGAACAAAAGCTAATC TCC - 3 * , and reverse primer 5 * - AAAAAA GGCG CGCC TCAATTCAAGTCTTCTTCTGAGAT - 3 * was cloned into pGEM - TA ( Promega ) , yielding plasmid pGEM - TA / Myc . Sequence analysis of the insert in pGEM - TA / Myc revealed that the Pac I site at one end was intact and that the insert encoded 13 Myc epitopes ( the DNA encoding two Myc epitopes had apparently been lost during the PCR reaction ) followed by the stop codon intro - duced by the primer . However , the Asc I site had been altered during the PCR reaction . Thus , pFA6a - 13Myc - kanMX6 was constructed by diges - tion of pGEM - TA / Myc with Eco RI ( at a site present in the pGEM - TA sequences ) , followed by blunting of the ends using T4 DNA polymerase and then digestion with Pac I . The resulting 594 - bp fragment was puriﬁed and ligated to pFA6a - GFP ( S65T ) - kanMX6 that had been digested with Asc I , made blunt ended as above , and then digested with Pac I . Plasmids pFA6a - 13Myc - TRP1 and pFA6a - 13Myc - His3MX6 were constructed by replacing the Bgl II - Pme I fragment containing the kanMX6 module of pFA6a - 13Myc - kanMX6 with the corresponding fragments from pFA6a - TRP1 and pFA6a - His3MX6 , respectively . To construct plasmid pFA6a - GST - kanMX6 , the 2 700 - bp PCR product obtained using pGEX - 2T ( see above ) as template , forward primer 5 * - AAAA TTAATTAA TATGTCCCCTATACTA GGTTATTG - 3 * , and reverse primer 5 * - AAAA GG CGCGCC TCAACGCGGAACCAGATCCGATT TTGG - 3 * was digested with Pac I and Asc I and ligated into Pac I / Asc I - digested pFA6a - GFP ( S65T ) - kanMX6 , thus replacing GFP ( S65T ) with sequences encoding GST followed by a stop codon introduced by the primer . To con - struct plasmids pFA6a - GST - TRP1 and pFA6a - GST - His3MX6 , Bgl II - Pme I fragments from pFA6a - TRP1 and pFA6a - His3MX6 , respectively , were ligated into Bgl II / Pme I - digested pFA6a - GST - kanMX6 . To construct plasmid pFA6a - kanMX6 - PGAL1 , the PCR product ( containing the GAL1 promoter ) obtained using pBM272 ( see above ) as template , forward primer 5 * - AAAA AGATCT GTAAAG AGCCCCATTATCTTA - 3 * , and reverse primer 5 * - AAAA TTAATTAA AGA CAT TTTGAGATCC GGGTTTTTTCTCCTT - 3 * was digested with Bgl II and Pac I , and the resulting 569 - bp fragment was ligated into Bgl II / Pac I - digested pFA6a - kanMX6 . To construct plasmids pFA6a - TRP1 - PGAL1 and pFA6a - His3MX6 - PGAL1 , the Bgl II - Pac I fragment containing P GAL1 from pFA6a - kanMX6 - PGAL1 was ligated into Bgl II / Pac I - digested pFA6a - TRP1 and pFA6a - His3MX6 , respectively .

Transformation of yeast and screening for homologous integration at the target gene PCR was performed using one of the plasmids shown in Figure 1 as template and appropriate target - gene - speciﬁc primer pairs designed as indicated in Figure 1 and Table 1 . The products from six to eight PCR reactions were pooled , extracted once with phenol : chloroform : isoamyl alcohol ( 25 : 24 : 1 ) , precipitated , and resuspended in 10 (cid:236) l of water . This concentrated DNA was trans - formed into S . cerevisiae cells using a lithium acetate procedure ( Gietz et al . , 1992 ) . G418 - resistant transformants ( containing the kanMX6 module ) were selected essentially as described previously ( Wach et al . , 1994 ; Wach , 1996 ) . Brieﬂy , the transformed cells were washed once with 1 ml of water , resuspended in 200 (cid:236) l of water , and spread on two YPD plates ( 100 (cid:236) l per plate ) . These plates were incubated at 30 ) C for 2 – 3 days and replica - plated to YPD - G418 plates . To iden - tify stable transformants , the YPD - G418 plates Table 1 .

It is possible that using longer gene - speciﬁc sequences may improve the e Y ciency of homologous integration in some cases ; note that this would slightly increase the sizes of the expected PCR products ( see Figure 1 ) . b For deletions , the gene - speciﬁc sequences of the forward primer are typically chosen to end just upstream of the start codon , whereas those of the reverse primer are chosen to end just downstream of the stop codon . c For tagging of full - length proteins , the gene - speciﬁc sequences of the forward primer are chosen to end just upstream of the stop codon , preserving the reading frame of the tag , whereas those of the reverse primer are chosen to end just downstream of the stop codon . For C - terminal truncations , the gene - speciﬁc sequences of the forward primer are chosen depending on the desired location of the truncation . If the protein is to be truncated without tagging , primer F3 ( which includes a stop codon ; underlining ) is used with one of the plasmids of Figure 1A that contains the Asc I site at the junction of the tag and T ADH1 sequences . d The gene - speciﬁc sequences are typically chosen so as to delete 2 50 nucleotides upstream of the target gene start codon , but this can be varied depending on the desired extent of deletion of target gene promoter sequences and the perceived risk of a V ecting the expression of adjacent genes . e The start codon ( provided by its complement in the primer ; bold face ) lies 69 nucleotides downstream of the GAL1 promoter transcriptional start . For P GAL1 - controlled expression of full - length genes , the gene - speciﬁc sequences are chosen to correspond to the complement of the N - terminal codons of the target gene , ending just downstream of the start codon ; for N - terminal truncations , the gene - speciﬁc sequences are chosen from the region where the truncation is desired . In each case , the primer must maintain the reading frame of the start codon provided in the primer . f For N - terminal tagging of full - length proteins , the gene - speciﬁc sequences are chosen to correspond to the N - terminal codons of the target gene ; they may or may not include its start codon but must maintain the indicated reading frame . For N - terminal truncation with protein tagging , the gene - speciﬁc sequences are chosen from the region where the truncation is desired , maintaining the indicated reading frame . Each tag requires a unique primer that corresponds to the region just upstream of the stop codon present in the DNA encoding the protein tags . 957 pcr - based gene deletion and modification ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PCR template plasmids for gene deletion and gene tagging Wach et al . ( 1994 , 1997 ) have described a set of plasmids that can be used as templates in PCR reactions to generate DNA fragments that can be used for targeted modiﬁcation of chromosomal genes . These plasmids use either the kanMX6 module ( which confers resistance to G418 ) or the His3MX6 module ( containing the S . pombe his5 + gene , which complements S . cerevisiae his3 mutations ) as selectable marker and allow either gene deletion or generation of fusion genes encod - ing proteins with GFP ( wild - type or the S65T mutant version ) fused to their C - termini . In the work reported here , we have expanded this collection of plasmids in three ways . First , we have created plasmids that allow use of the S . cerevisiae TRP1 gene as the selectable marker for gene deletion and the generation of C - terminal GFP ( S65T ) fusions ( Figure 1A ) . A disadvantage of using the TRP1 marker in this method is that it can recombine e Y ciently with the endogenous trp1 locus ; thus it is only practical for use in strains that contain TRP1 deletions such as trp1 ˜ - 63 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . However , because the PCR products obtained using the kanMX6 and His3MX6 modules are homologous for long regions at their ends due to the shared A . gossypii TEF promoter and terminator sequences ( Figure 1A ) , transformation of a strain containing one of these modules with a PCR product contain - ing the other ( to modify a second gene ) may result in recombination with the previously integrated selectable marker rather than with sequences at the new target gene . Because the TRP1 - containing PCR products have only 2 20 bp of homology with either the kanMX6 or the His3MX6 module , this problem is avoided . Second , we have created plasmids that allow use of any of the three selectable markers to generate fusion genes encoding proteins fused at their C - termini to a triple HA epitope , a 13Myc epitope , or GST ( Figure 1A ) . These protein tags have all been widely used ; commercially available mono - clonal antibodies directed against the HA or Myc epitope ( see Materials and Methods ) work well for immunoﬂuorescence , Western - blot analysis , and immunoprecipitation , and reagents for isolat - ing GST - fusion proteins are also commercially available . In addition , we have had success in localizing GST - fusion proteins in yeast by 958 m . s . longtine et al . ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Yeast 14 , 953 – 961 ( 1998 ) immunoﬂuorescence using anti - GST antibodies ( Bi and Pringle , 1996 ; Longtine et al . , 1998 ) . Appropriate design of the forward primer allows the same plasmids to be used for C - terminal pro - tein truncation with or without the inclusion of a protein tag ( see primers F2 and F3 in Figure 1A and Table 1 ) . Third , to allow the regulated expression and / or overexpression of full - length or N - terminally trun - cated proteins with or without N - terminal 3HA , GST , or GFP ( S65T ) tags , as well as of tagged or untagged full - length or C - terminally truncated proteins , we constructed a set of plasmids in which each of the selectable markers is cloned upsteam of the GAL1 promoter ( P GAL1 ) with or without associated tag sequences ( Figure 1B ) . Appropriate design of the reverse primer ( see Table 1 ) allows the generation of the N - terminal truncations . Validation of the system The system described here has been tested by manipulating several genes using the plasmids shown in Figure 1 as templates , primers designed as described in Table 1 ( see also Figure 1 ) , and the procedures described in Materials and Methods . For example , we tagged the 3 * end of GIN4 ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) with 3HA sequences using the module from plasmid pFA6a - 3HA - kanMX6 . The normal cell morphology of the resulting strains indicated that Gin4p - 3HA was functional , and it localized normally to the mother - bud neck ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) , as shown by immunoﬂu - orescence using anti - HA antibodies ( Figure 2A ) . To test the GAL1 promoter and TRP1 selectable - marker constructs , we then replaced the GIN4 promoter of one of the GIN4 – 3HA : kanMX6 strains by the module from plasmid pFA6a - TRP1 - PGAL1 . In the resulting strains , the expression of Gin4p - 3HA was regulated by the carbon source , as expected . During growth on glucose , very few cells had detectable Gin4p - 3HA ( Figure 2B ) ; rarely , weak Gin4p - 3HA staining was visible ( Figure 2B , arrowhead ) . The addition of galactose to cultures growing on ra Y nose rapidly induced the expres - sion of Gin4p - 3HA ( Figure 2C ) , and long - term overexpression by growth on galactose resulted in abnormal cell morphologies ( Figure 2D ) like those observed after overexpression of normal Gin4p ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) . Similar results were obtained when the expression of a Myo1p - GFP fusion protein , which localizes to the mother - bud neck ( Figure 2E ; E . Bi and J . R . Pringle , unpub - lished results ) , was placed under control of the GAL1 promoter using the module from plasmid pFA6a - His3MX6 - PGAL1 ( Figure 2F , G ) . Inter - estingly , additional patches of Myo1p - GFP signal , which were often at or near the bud tips , were observed in many of the galactose - induced cells Figure 2 .

Yeast 14 , 953 – 961 ( 1998 ) ( Figure 2G , arrowheads ) . It is not known if these patches represent an aspect of normal Myo1p localization or are purely an artifact of overex - pression of the Myo1p - GFP fusion protein . To test the modules for introducing the GAL1 promoter with simultaneous N - terminal tagging , we replaced the promoter of the essential gene CDC3 with P GAL1 - GFP sequences using the module from plasmid pFA6a - His3MX6 - PGAL1 - GFP . As expected , GFP - Cdc3p was not detect - able when cells of a heterozygous diploid ( His3MX6 : P GAL1 - GFP - CDC3 / CDC3 ) were grown on glucose , but it was localized properly to the mother - bud neck ( Kim et al . , 1991 ) when the cells were grown on galactose - containing medium ( data not shown ) . Similarly , haploid His3MX6 : P GAL1 - GFP - CDC3 segregants were viable on galactose - containing medium and localized GFP - Cdc3p normally to the neck ( Figure 2H ) , but they were inviable on glucose - containing medium . Taken together , the results indicate that the various modules shown in Figure 1 indeed function as expected . Conclusions In this paper , we describe a set of plasmids useful as templates for PCR - mediated gene modiﬁcations in S . cerevisiae . Using any of three selectable markers , the plasmids allow gene deletion , gene overexpression ( using the regulatable GAL1 pro - moter ) , C - or N - terminal protein tagging [ with GFP ( S65T ) , GST , or the 3HA or 13Myc epitope ] , and partial N - or C - terminal deletions ( with or without concomitant protein tagging ) . Because of the modular nature of the plasmids ( Figure 1 ; Table 1 ) , they allow a wide variety of gene manipu - lations using a small number of PCR primers . The e Y ciency of integration by homologous recombi - nation at the desired target site is typically high ; in our hands , it has usually been > 75 % ( ranging from 2 20 % to > 95 % ) . The tagging of proteins often provides a rapid and e V ective route to their localization and isola - tion . Most proteins appear to localize normally and retain function when tagged at their C - termini , and proteins that are not functional with one C - terminal tag are often functional with another or with an N - terminal tag . A particular attraction of protein tagging for localization studies is the ease of doing double staining . Because high - quality mouse monoclonal antibodies to the HA and Myc epitopes are available ( see Materials and Methods ) , a protein tagged with one of these epitopes should generally be localizable in combi - nation with a protein for which a non - mouse anti - body is available . Moreover , the commercial avail - ability of rabbit antibodies to both HA ( Berkeley Antibody Company ) and GST ( Molecular Probes , Eugene OR ; see also Bi and Pringle , 1996 ) allows double staining of two tagged proteins . The versatility of this system for PCR - mediated gene modiﬁcations is far from exhausted . In particular , it could clearly be extended by the addition of other selectable markers ( e . g . , see La¨ngle - Rouault and Jacobs , 1995 ; van den Berg and Steensma , 1997 ) , additional promoters ( e . g . , see Niedenthal et al . , 1996 ) , and / or other protein tags [ including new GFP variants with altered emission spectra ( Heim and Tsien , 1996 ) that could perhaps be used in combination with GFP ( S65T ) - tagged proteins to allow double labeling in living cells ] . The approach can also be used to introduce a reporter gene for assays of promoter function ( e . g . , see Niedenthal et al . , 1996 ; Wach et al . , 1998 ) . Another useful variation of this methodology allows the PCR - mediated introduction of site - directed mutations into chromosomal genes ( La¨ngle - Rouault and Jacobs , 1995 ) . Finally , transformation of yeast with PCR - generated fragments can also be used to introduce sequences encoding a protein tag into a gene carried on a resident plasmid ( A . McKenzie and J . R . Pringle , unpublished results ) ; the plasmid carrying the tagged gene can be isolated by elec - troporation into E . coli , selecting for kanamycin resistance , and then retransformed into yeast .
