The actin cytoskeleton has important roles in a wide range of cellular processes , including motility , cytokinesis , vesicular trafficking , signalling and mechanical processes such as contractility and epithelial barrier mainte - nance . Dysregulation of the actin cyto skeleton occurs during pathological conditions such as metastatic cancer , autoimmune disorders and birth defects . One specific form of the actin cytoskeleton , which is a highly dynamic branched network , is crucial for several pro - cesses , including the formation of protrusions during cell migration . The key nucleator for this branched actin network is the seven - protein actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( ARP2 / 3 ) complex . This complex is highly conserved in almost all eukaryotes . Extensive in vitro studies , including biochemical and structural characterization , reveal that the ARP2 / 3 com - plex binds existing actin mother filaments and initiates the formation of daughter fila - ments that branch off the mother filaments at a characteristic ~ 70° angle 1 . The ARP2 / 3 complex was first identified as an interacting factor for the actin - binding protein profilin 2 , which assists in F - actin assembly . Around the same time , this com - plex was purified and shown to be a crucial factor for the motility of the pathogenic bacte - rium Listeria monocytogenes in cell extracts 3 . The name of the complex derives from the fact that two of the subunits are actin - related proteins , termed ARP2 and ARP3 . The other five subunits ( ARPC1 – 5 ) provide a framework for positioning these two ARP subunits at the pointed end of the daughter filament ( BOX 1 ) . Extensive structural , cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) , fluores - cence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) and crosslinking data support a model in which the filament nucleation and branching events are tightly interrelated with the ARP2 and ARP3 subunits , as they contribute the first two subunits of the new filament upon a conformational change and rearrangement of multiple subunits of the complex 1 , 4 . Although this complex was discovered nearly 20 years ago and has been extensively characterized biochemically and structurally , studies to elucidate its biological function are still providing new and exciting results . Nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) ( BOX 1 ) are activators of the ARP2 / 3 comple x ( for a recent comprehensive review , see REF . 5 ) . In addition , several classes of nega - tive regulators of the ARP2 / 3 complex have been identified in the past few years ( BOX 1 ) , including glia maturation factor ( GMF ) 6 , coronin 1B 7 , gadkin 8 and protein interacting with C kinase 1 ( PICK1 ) 9 . These inhibiting factors , however , are beyond the scope of this Review . ARP2 / 3 complex activity may also be regulated via functional interactions with actin - binding proteins such as capping protein , which promotes ARP2 / 3 - mediated filament nucleation 10 . In this Progress article , we focus on recent advances concerning the structure of NPF - containing complexes , the identi - fication of new NPFs , the regulation of the ARP2 / 3 complex by NPFs and the potential for ARP2 / 3 - independent NPF functions . Moreover , we discuss new data on the cell biological function of ARP2 / 3 branched actin that have been obtained using new chemical and genetic approaches . In particular , we discuss the role of the ARP2 / 3 complex in vesicular trafficking and directional motility of cells . NPFs — an actin network growth industry Soon after its initial isolation and character - ization , it became clear that the ARP2 / 3 complex has relatively poor in vitro nucleatin g ability on its own 11 . This observation led to the notion that cellular cofactors are required to activate the nucleation and branching activity of the ARP2 / 3 complex . Subsequently , several ARP2 / 3 NPFs were identified that could be divided into two subclasses ( BOX 1 ) . Type I NPFs possess a characteristic VCA domain ( that is , the verprolin - homology domain ( also known as WH2 ) , the cofilin - homology domain ( also known as central domain ) and the acidic domain ) composed of three conserved motifs that allow for the binding of G - actin ( through the V motif ) and ARP2 / 3 ( through the CA motif ) . Type I NPFs include WASP family verprolin - homologous protein ( WAVE ; also known as SCAR ) , Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) , neural WASP ( NWASP ) , WASP and SCAR homologue ( WASH ) and junction - mediating and regulatory protein ( JMY ) , among others . Type II NPFs such as cortactin lack complete VCA domains , but they have acidic domains at their amino terminus that bind the ARP2 / 3 complex and tandem repeat domains that bind F - actin . Although cortactin can weakly activate the ARP2 / 3 complex , it has been shown to bind to ARP2 / 3 - nucleated filament branches and to block debranching 7 , 12 , suggesting that it has functions beyond simply activating the ARP2 / 3 complex . New insights into the regulation and cellular functions of the ARP2 / 3 complex Jeremy D . Rotty , Congying Wu and James E . Bear Abstract | The actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( ARP2 / 3 ) complex nucleates branched actin filament networks , but requires nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) to stimulate this activity . NPFs include proteins such as Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) , neural WASP ( NWASP ) , WASP family verprolin - homologous protein ( WAVE ; also known as SCAR ) and the recently identified WASP and SCAR homologue ( WASH ) complex . The mechanisms underlying NPF - dependent regulation and the cellular functions of ARP2 / 3 are being unravelled using new chemical and genetic approaches . Of particular interest is the role of the ARP2 / 3 complex in vesicular trafficking and directional cell motility .

The well - studied NPFs WASP and NWASP exist independently in cells and are capable of autoinhibition . Their VCA domains are tightly bound to an intramolecular domain known as the GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) , and this association precludes binding to the ARP2 / 3 complex 13 . When activated GTPases bind the GBD , intra - molecular inhibition is relieved , and bind - ing of the ARP2 / 3 complex can proceed ( FIG . 1a ) . WAVE proteins are regulated in a different manner as they are part of a multi - meric WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) , which comprises five distinct proteins . The WRC is inactive towards ARP2 / 3 , unless it is activated by RAC GTPases , phosphatidyl inositol or kinases 14 , 15 , 16 ( FIG . 1b ) . Although both WAVE proteins and WASP can be activated by small GTPases , WAVE proteins lack GBDs , which has complicated the understanding of WAVE regulation . In addition to a WAVE protein , each WRC is composed of SRA1 ( specifically RAC1 - associated protein 1 ; also known as CYFIP1 ) , NAP1 ( NEF - associated protein 1 ) , ABI2 ( ABL interactor 2 ) and HSPC300 ( REF . 15 ) ( FIG . 1b ) . The recent report of a WRC crystal structure revealed that the V region of WAVE is sequestered by SRA1 , and the C region is sequestered by SRA1 and a meander region of WAVE1 ( REF . 17 ) . Another key insight gained from the WRC crystal structure is how RAC1 can activate WAVE proteins in the absence of a canonical GBD . The crystal structure and in vitro biochemical studies showed that RAC1 binds competitively to the WRC and displaces SRA1 from the VCA domain 17 . The authors of this study also further assessed WRC regulation and showed that phosphorylation of Tyr151 in WAVE1 disrupts the SRA1 – WAVE1 interaction , although other residues may also have a role 17 . Moreover , a recent study on Dictyostelium discoideum SCAR found that phosphorylated Ser residues in the acidic domain led to inhibition of SCAR activity 18 . With the structure now revealed , ARP2 / 3 activation in response to variou s stimuli can be understood at a more mechanistic level . WASH : linking ARP2 / 3 to vesicular trafficking . WASH is a recently discovered type I NPF that has been found on endosomes , where it stimulates ARP2 / 3 activity and controls endosomal sorting 19 – 21 . The control of endosome sorting is not fully understood but probably involves vesicular scission , and the force required for scission is potentially generated by branched actin polymerization . WASH is evolutionarily conserved in most eukary - otic organisms , from unicellular organisms to humans ( excluding plants and , notably , Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) . This is sup - ported by the finding that WASH deple - tion dramatically affects endosome - related pathways in many organisms and the obser - vation that Wash - knockout fibroblasts have trafficking defects 22 , 23 . In addition to endo - some dynamics , WASH has been implicated in exocytosis and in integrin - based invasive migration 24 , 25 . A major outstanding ques - tion regarding WASH was whether it exists as part of a larger multimeric complex , like the WAVE proteins , or as a monomer similarly to WASP . Recent reports have confirmed that WASH is part of a ~ 500 kDa complex ( termed WASH com - plex ) with FAM21 , SWIP ( strumpellin - and WASH - interacting protein ; also known as KIAA1033 ) , strumpellin and CCDC53 ( coiled - coil domain - containing pro - tein 53 ) 20 , 21 ( FIG . 1c ) . Remarkably , like WAVE proteins , WASH is held in an inhibited state by the complex , and several struc - tural aspects of the WRC and the WASH complex are highly similar , despite weak sequence similarities between each compo - nent of the complexes 26 . The other subunits of the WASH complex may help target WASH to endosomes , as WASH appar - ently lacks intrinsic phospholipid - binding domains and has not been shown to bind endosomal membranes 26 . These emerging pieces of evidence sug - gest that the WRC and the WASH complex are evolutionarily divergent regulators of ARP2 / 3 that have both maintained the function to elegantly regulate the activity of WASH and WAVE factors and to trigger ARP2 / 3 - dependent branching at distinct subcellular locations . It will be interest - ing to compare the crystal structure of the WASH complex to that of the WRC , as differences in the two complexes may help explain their distinct non - overlapping subcellular organization . This would be a first step towards understanding how the equilibrium between networks of branched actin , which are necessary for numerous and distinct subcellular processes occurring simultaneously , is maintained at the cellular level . In addition to WASH , the type II NPF cortactin regulates ARP2 / 3 activity and is required for endosome maturation and maintenance of Golgi morphology , which confirms a major role for the ARP2 / 3 complex in vesicular trafficking 27 . Box 1 | ARP2 / 3 regulation The actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( ARP2 / 3 ) complex binds to the side of an F - actin mother filament and positions the ARP2 and ARP3 subunits at the pointed end of a daughter filament , thereby stimulating nucleation of a new F‑actin filament at a ~ 70° angle relative to the mother filament ( see the figure ) . ARP2 / 3 is a weak actin nucleator in vitro and is dependent on activation via direct interaction with nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) of the type I family , which contain the VCA domain ( that is , the verprolin‑homology domain , the cofilin‑homology domain and the acidic domain ) or of the type II family , which lack a full VCA domain . NPFs are regulated by phosphatidyl‑ inositol ( PtdIns ) and the activity of small GTPases and kinases . Other factors have been recently discovered to be ARP2 / 3 inhibitors , including glia maturation factors ( GMFs ) , coronins , cofilin , gadkin and protein interacting with C kinase 1 ( PICK1 ) . Similarly to NPFs , these inhibitory factors are subject to regulation by various signalling pathways , and this allows cells to fine‑tune ARP2 / 3‑based actin assembly .

V C A FAM21 CCDC53 P P ? PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 a b c P VCA binding : more complicated than it looks . It has long been known both from biochemi - cal studies and structural modelling that the ARP2 / 3 complex binds to an actin monomer and a mother filament as it stimulates the formation of a branched daughter filament 28 . In addition to actin , ARP2 / 3 has long been known to contact VCA - containing NPFs ( see above ) . However , it remained unclear whether one or multiple VCA domain - containing proteins contact ARP2 / 3 to stimulate its activity . Furthermore , the VCA - binding sites on the ARP2 / 3 comple x remained elusive . Two recent studies reported that ARP2 / 3 is capable of binding two monomeric CA or VCA domains 29 , 30 . Both groups posit that the first binding site , which is located on ARP2 , has a high affin - ity binding site for VCA ( or CA ) and shows a weak ARP2 / 3 - activating capacity and that the second one , on ARP3 , has a low affinity and high activating activity . Binding ulti - mately results in the rearrangement of the ARP2 and ARP3 subunits into a nucleation competent conformation . However , the idea of multiple VCA - binding events remains somewhat murky . A recent report using an unmodified NWASP VCA domain reported that the 1 : 1 : 1 ratio of the VCA – ARP2 / 3 – actin com - plex can be achieved at varying molar ratios of these proteins 31 . The discrepancy may arise from the use of unmodified VCA versus tagged VCA domains , the use of the NWASP VCA domain versus the WASP VCA domain or the use of the CA domain versus the VCA domain , or even the species from which the VCA constructs were cloned . Regardless of the resolution of this discrepancy , these studies highlight the incomplete under - standing of ARP2 / 3 complex activation . Assuming multiple VCA - binding sites exist on the ARP2 / 3 complex , the functional sig - nificance of this fact for ARP2 / 3 regulation in vivo are unknown and will require further experiments such as the reconstitution of ARP2 / 3 - depleted or - deficient cells . ARP2 / 3‑independent roles of NPFs . The type I NPF JMY was initially identified as a p53 co - activator that accumulates in the nucleus , thereby activating p53 - dependent apoptotic genes 32 . In fact , the role of JMY as an NPF was only appreciated later when it was shown that JMY activated ARP2 / 3 and assembled unbranched actin directly 33 . Recent work has explored the hypothesis that the transcriptional activity of JMY is related to its role in stimulating branched actin . In fact , the actin - binding WH2 domains ( homologous to the V subdomain of VCA ) of JMY overlap with an atypical nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) , and when actin is bound by JMY the NLS is inaccessible to importins , thereby blocking JMY nuclear import 34 . Conversely , when actin polymer - ization is stimulated by DNA damage , less monomeric actin is present for JMY to bind to , its NLS becomes accessible , nuclear translocation occurs and p53 target genes are transcribed 34 . Although unique in the order in which its dual activities were discovered , JMY is by no means the only example of an NPF with multi - faceted activity . NWASP is an ubiquitously expressed NPF , and its depletion in epithelial cells decreases F - actin assembly at cell – cell junctions 35 . Interestingly , the ARP2 / 3 - and actin - binding VCA domain of NWASP is completely dispensable for this activity . The WH1 domain of NWASP , however , is cru - cially important for F - actin assembly at cell – cell junctions , but NWASP cannot directly stimulate actin polymerization . Instead , it organizes the preformed F - actin bundles that are resident at adherens junctions 35 . The cell biology of the ARP2 / 3 complex Although the structure and biochemistry of the ARP2 / 3 complex has been rigor - ously studied in vitro , the cellular function of ARP2 / 3 has mainly been inferred from its localization patterns ( FIG . 2 ) . A major hindrance for the understanding of ARP2 / 3 function in vivo has been the lethality of genetic disruptions of ARP2 / 3 function in model organisms from yeast to mice 36 , 37 . In recent years , however , a number of groups have made important advances in understanding ARP2 / 3 function in cells by generating tools that allow the study of ARP2 / 3 function in diverse cellular settings from oocytes to fibroblasts . Dynamic ARP2 / 3 functions revealed by CK‑666 . Crucial new tools that help to fur - ther our understanding of ARP2 / 3 function in vivo are the recently identified specific and reversible small - molecule inhibitors of the ARP2 / 3 complex 38 . One of these inhibitors , CK - 666 , is capable of inhibiting ARP2 / 3 complexes that have been purified Figure 1 | Activation of NPFs by various stimuli . a | The nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and neural WASP ( NWASP ) are inhibited by an intramolecular asso - ciation between their VCA domain ( that is , verprolin - homology domain , cofilin - homology domain and acidic domain ) and their GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) . Conformational changes induced by binding of phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and CDC42 and by phosphorylation of WASP and NWASP release the intramolecular interaction , which leads to activation of WASP and NWASP . b | A protein complex comprising the regulatory proteins SRA1 ( specifically RAC1‑associated protein 1 ) , NAP1 ( NEF - associated protein 1 ) , HSP300 and ABI2 ( ABL interactor 2 ) holds WAVE ( WASP family verprolin - homologous protein ) in an inactive conformation . The WAVE VCA domain is also thought to be phosphorylated under baseline conditions , assisting in the negative regulation of the complex . Transition to the activated state occurs through kinase - mediated phosphorylation of WAVE itself or by binding of the small GTPase RAC1 . Both of these events result in the release of the WAVE VCA domain from its inhibitory interaction with SRA1 . c | Similarly to WAVE , WASH ( WASP and SCAR homo - logue ) is held in an inhibited state by a complex composed of SWIP ( strumpellin - and WASH - interacting protein ) , strumpellin , CCDC53 ( coiled - coil domain - containing protein 53 ) and FAM21 . The capping protein CapZ is an additional component thought to be important for WASH regulation , although it is not part of the core complex . The signals and conformational changes associated with activation of the WASH complex remain elusive .

Its revers - ibility makes it ideal for real - time analysis of ARP2 / 3 function in cells . Using CK - 666 , ARP2 / 3 has been implicated in asymmetric cell division and cytoplasmic streaming of actin in oocytes and actin retrograde flow in neurons 39 – 41 , processes that are only assayable in living cells . Both the cytoplasmic stream - ing and retrograde flow studies reveal a cell - ular balance between ARP2 / 3 - stimulated branch formation ( pushing ) and myosin contractility ( pulling ) . These studies helped settle questions of how ARP2 / 3 contributed to actin assembly in oocytes and neuronal growth cones , and therefore how the com - plex relates to the overall processes of meiosis and growth cone migration . Although the small - molecule inhibitors of the ARP2 / 3 complex have already provided new insights into ARP2 / 3 function in vivo , caution is warranted until the specificity of these drugs is more thoroughly evaluated . CK - 666 is routinely used at a concentration of 50 – 100 μM and , as with any drug , off - target effects are possible . One encouraging finding is that CK - 666 , even when used at 100 μM , caused no additional phenotypes when used on ARP2 / 3 - depleted fibroblasts 42 . However , another ARP2 / 3 inhibitor , CK - 869 , caused additional phenotypes , including blebbing ( that is , irregular plasma membrane protrusions ) in cells depleted of the ARP2 / 3 complex , which suggests possible off - target effects ( C . W . and J . E . B , unpublished obser - vations ) . The development of improved ARP2 / 3 inhibitors continues , and recently a compound that possesses a half - maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC 50 ) value that is three times lower than that of CK - 666 was synthesized on the basis of in silico modelling 43 . ARP2 / 3‑dependent and ‑independent cell motility . Another approach for studying the ARP2 / 3 complex in vivo that has ( re ) - emerged is loss - of - function genetics . Until recently , the prevailing idea in the field was that loss of the ARP2 / 3 complex leads to cellular lethality . Within the past year , however , independent groups that work on ARP2 / 3 in the context of cell migration have generated stable ARP2 / 3 - knockdown and - knockout fibroblasts that can still prolifer - ate in cultur e 42 , 44 . The ARP2 / 3 - knockdown approach utilizes a mouse fibroblast cell line that is deficient in the tumour suppressors INK4A and ARF . In this background , two separate subunits of the ARP2 / 3 complex were simultaneously depleted , leading to near complete loss of the complex 42 . In the other study , the ARPC3 ( also known as p21 ) subunit of the complex was targeted in mice , which resulted in the familiar pre - implantation lethal phenotype arising as early as embryonic stage 3 . 5 ( REF . 44 ) . However , embryonic stem ( ES ) cells were recovered from the Arpc3 − / − or wild - type littermate blastocysts that were subsequently differenti - ated into separate fibroblast cell lines . Both approaches yielded fibroblasts with pheno - types that were strikingly similar in many aspects . The similar phenotypes included the downregulation of multiple ARP2 / 3 subunits in response to either knockdown or knockout of one or more subunits of the complex , a spiky cell morphology dominated by filopo - dia ( that is , finger - like protrusions without branched actin ) and a complete loss of lamel - lipodia ( that is , fan - shaped protrusions highly enriched for branched actin ) 42 , 44 . Knockout of the gene encoding ARPC3 resulted in a delay in wound closure and a defect in directional - ity but did not affect the speed of migration . In the case of double - knockdown cells , a defect in cell migration speed was observed that was highly dependent on the concen - tration of the cell matrix that the cells were plated on . In addition , both groups observed defects in cell spreading . Figure 2 | Cellular functions of ARP2 / 3 . Branched actin generated by the actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( ARP2 / 3 ) complex localizes to the leading edge of migrating cells , adherens junctions , phagosomes ( which are required for the engulfment of foreign pathogens and particles found predominantly in immune cells ) and endosomes . Polymerizing branched actin in the cytoplasm also contributes to cyto - plasmic streaming ( represented by blue lines ) . ARP2 / 3 - generated branched actin at the leading edge provides the protrusive force that is required to generate and extend the broad sheet - like protrusions known as the lamellipodia . The leading edge of migrating cells also harbours distinct thin protru - sions known as filopodia , which are characterized by bundled parallel arrays of unbranched F‑actin . Some of the bundled actin filaments found in filopodia are thought to be initiated from branched networks that have been generated by the ARP2 / 3 complex at the leading edge . ARP2 / 3 also localizes to invado podia and podosomes , which are specialized protease - rich structures implicated in both cell invasion and matrix degradation . In addition to migration - related phenomena , the ARP2 / 3 complex has also been shown to localize to endosomes and phagosomes and has been implicated in both endocytosis and phagocytosis . ARP2 / 3 also resides at adherens junctions , although its function at this site remains unclear . Recent data also implicates the ARP2 / 3 complex in producing constantly stream - ing pools of F - actin in the cytoplasm . The established and emerging roles of the ARP2 / 3 complex highlight a functional diversity that stands to be further dissected with recently developed genetic and chemical tools .

All rights reserved However , the two groups reported differ - ent results concerning the requirement of the ARP2 / 3 complex for cell movement in response to soluble factors ( a process known as chemotaxis ) . In one case , RNAi - mediated depletion of the ARP2 / 3 complex or inhibi - tion by CK - 666 had no effect on chemotaxis along gradients of platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , whereas Arpc3 − / − cells were defective in cell migration along gradients of epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) . It is worth considering why these divergent results were obtained . Several methodological differences between these studies could explain these differences including : the choice of chemo - attractant ( PDGF versus EGF ) ; the method of ARP2 / 3 abrogation ( knockdown and drug treatment versus knockout ) ; and the design of the chemotaxis chamber . With regards to the chamber design , the knockdown approach used a chamber in which media is constantly exchanged , whereas the knock - out approach utilized a closed chamber in which the cells remained in the same media throughout the experiment . Future studies will be required to systematically examine these methodological differences and resolve this discrepancy . In addition to being dispensable for chemotaxis , the ARP2 / 3 complex was found to be crucially important for haptotaxis , which is the ability of a migrating cell to sense extracellular matrix ( ECM ) gradien ts on the substrate 42 . Cells that lack the ARP2 / 3 complex could not sense or respond to gradients of fibronectin , laminin or vitro - nectin , whereas control cells in the same microfluidic chamber robustly responded by migrating towards the higher concentration of the ECM . Focal adhesions are membrane - associated structures that mediate cell – ECM interactions , and when the properties of these structures were assessed using a new image analysis method , they were shown to be less well aligned in the ARP2 / 3 - depleted cells compared with control cells 42 . It is tempting to speculate that the role of ARP2 / 3 in haptotaxis relates to its ability to align focal adhesions within the lamel - lipodium at the leading edge . Future studies will be required to more fully understand the relationship between ARP2 / 3 , the actin structures it generates and the ability of cells to respond to ECM cues . A new era of ARP2 / 3 research Although we have learned a great deal about the ARP2 / 3 complex since its discovery 18 years ago , there is much work left to do , and several pressing questions remain . What is the functional significance of multiple VCA - binding sites on the ARP2 / 3 complex ? Are there ARP2 / 3 - independent functions for all NPFs , and how do they integrate with ARP2 / 3 - dependent func - tions ? How is WASH activated within the WASH complex , and how is the complex targeted to vesicles ? How does ARP2 / 3 loss activate the cellular senescence machinery ( such as the INK4A and ARF locus ) ? What impact does the loss of ARP2 / 3 have on other cytoskeletal networks and signal - ling pathways ? The recent development of the small - molecule inhibitors and the revived genetic approaches are poised to open a new era of ARP2 / 3 research . In this new era , we will be able to address many of these questions about the role of ARP2 / 3 in various in vivo processes , but also begin to ask questions about the global regula - tion and function of the actin cytoskeleton . Mammalian fibroblasts can proliferate in culture without the ARP2 / 3 complex , and this begs the question exactly what processes require the ARP2 / 3 complex . These fibro - blast cell lines lacking ARP2 / 3 provide a unique opportunity to address fundamental questions about NPF regulation , the struc - tural requirements of ARP2 / 3 for different processes in vivo and how other proteins that regulate ARP2 / 3 networks ( for example , coronins ) function ( or not ) in the absence of the ARP2 / 3 complex . Perhaps even more exciting than ARP2 / 3 - specific questions , ARP2 / 3 - deficient cells will allow investiga - tors to ask questions about how non - ARP2 / 3 complex - dependent pathways and ARP2 / 3 - dependent pathways interact in the cytoplasm , exemplified by a recent report suggesting that formins capture and elongate actin filaments that were initially generated by ARP2 / 3 ( REF . 45 ) . ARP2 / 3 - deficient cells have many F - actin structures that must be generated by mechanisms independent of ARP2 / 3 , which involve , for example formins , ENA / VASP ( enabled / vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ) and spire - like nucleators , or perhaps new unknown pathways . The ARP2 / 3 story seems to have many more chapters that have yet to unfold . Jeremy D . Rotty , Congying Wu and James E .
