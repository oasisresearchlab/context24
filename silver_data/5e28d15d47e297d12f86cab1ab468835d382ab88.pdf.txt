Note : Some included studies , indicated in the reference list [ * ] , provide preliminary findings that have not yet been certified by peer review ; these findings should be treated with some caution . Epidemiology Can children and young people contract COVID - 19 ? COVID - 19 infection has been reported in children and young people of all ages , including shortly after birth . 1 2 3 There have been far fewer confirmed cases of COVID - 19 in children than adults ( children consistently make up < 2 % of total case numbers in reports ) . 4 5 6 7 8 9 We cannot be certain how many children in the community have COVID - 19 in the absence of widespread , high quality sero surveillance studies , but it seems increasingly likely that there are comparatively few children with COVID - 19 disease in the community , particularly younger children . 4 10 11 12 Does COVID - 19 affect children and young people in the same way as adults ? The disease appears to take a milder course in children than in adults : most infected children present with mild symptoms or are asymptomatic , 1 4 8 13 14 15 16 17 and very few develop severe or life threatening disease . 9 18 19 In the absence of widespread community or serological testing , it is uncertain what the proportion with sub - clinical symptoms is . Deaths in children due to COVID - 19 have been extremely rare : mortality seems to be consistent at around 0 . 01 % ( in a similar region to seasonal influenza ) . 13 18 Transmission Are children as likely as adults to acquire COVID - 19 ? Modelling by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Health suggests children were more likely to be asymptomatic , but as susceptible as adults to infection , 18 as others have found . 13 However , emerging evidence contradicts this , suggesting that children may be less likely to acquire the disease . 4 10 11 20 21 22 23 24 25 This is supported in countries that have undertaken widespread community testing , where significantly lower case numbers in children than adults have been found . 4 11 This , coupled with low case numbers , would suggest that children may be less likely to acquire the disease . 26 27 Can children transmit the virus ? The importance of children in transmitting the virus is difficult to establish , in particular given the number of asymptomatic cases , 28 but there is some evidence that their role in transmitting the virus is fairly limited . Precise details regarding paediatric transmission cannot be confirmed without widespread sero surveillance , but trends are emerging . Studies of multiple family clusters have revealed children were unlikely to be the index case , in Guangzhou , China and internationally . 26 29 30 31 A SARS - CoV - 2 positive child in a cluster in the French Alps did not transmit the virus to anyone else , despite exposure to more than 100 people . 32 33 There is some evidence of asymptomatic transmission , 10 but also a signal that symptomatic patients present a higher risk of transmitting the virus than those who do not develop symptoms . 26 It is not clear how likely an infected child is to pass the infection compared to an infected adult , but there is no evidence that they are any more infectious . In the Netherlands , separate data from primary care and household studies suggests SARS - CoV - 2 is mainly spread between adults and from adult family members to children . 12 This is a rapidly developing area and current published finding may be out of date . We will update this as soon as further information becomes available . What is the duration of viral shedding in nasopharyngeal or throat swabs ? The duration of viral shedding ( in naso - pharyngeal or throat swabs ) has been reported in children to range from 6 - 22 days ( median 12 days ) . 34 Can children transmit the virus through their stool ? Several studies have now shown that SARS - CoV - 2 can be detected by PCR in the stool of affected infants for several weeks after symptoms have resolved ; faecal swabs have been found to be positive for a longer duration than nasal swabs , 35 36 with stool shedding reported to be more than 30 days . 37 38 This has raised the possibility of faecal - oral transmission . Research from Germany did not identify any live , culturable virus in stool despite viral RNA being detectable , suggesting this represents viral debris rather than active virus . 39 Further studies will be needed to clarify this . Clinical features and investigations What are the symptoms of COVID - 19 disease ? Disease presentation can range from no symptoms ( asymptomatic ) to severe pneumonia requiring ITU admission . 16 40 41 42 43 44 In the absence of widespread community or serological testing , it is uncertain what proportion are asymptomatic . When there are clinical features , they are non - specific and similar to other viral respiratory infections . The most common presenting features , present in more than 50 % of cases are cough and fever ; upper respiratory tract symptoms ( such as sore throat and rhinorrhoea ) occur in 30 - 40 % of patients ; diarrhoea and vomiting present in approximately 9 - 10 % of cases . 1 5 34 38 39 40 43 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 There are reports of infants presenting with fever but no respiratory symptoms . 54 Differences in immune responses may play a role in influencing the severity of symptoms . 55 Are there any signs that could help differentiate COVID - 19 from other childhood respiratory viral infections ? There appears to be little in the way of clinical signs in children to differentiate COVID - 19 from other childhood respiratory virus infections . There have not been any firm descriptions of wheeze with COVID - 19 in the literature so far . There are some cases indicating possible ( not proven ) association with skin manifestations56 in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID - 19 ( but please note , this case series does not describe the age of patients so includes adults ) , which may persist for some time once other symptoms have resolved and include acral areas of erythema oedema with some vesicles or pustules , other vesicular eruptions , urticarial lesions , other maculopapular lesions , livedo or necrosis . Dermatological exanthem , 57 papularmacular 58 and chilblain like lesions associated with COVID - 19 have also been reported in children . 59 60 61 Can SARS - CoV - 2 trigger a Kawasaki like syndrome ? An emerging phenomenon of a hyperinflammatory response syndrome , resembling Kawasaki shock , is reported in a case study describing a six month old who was treated for Kawasaki ' s and then subsequently was found to test positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . 62 A case series from London described eight children who presented with a hyperinflammatory syndrome similar to ' Kawasaki shock ' , four of whom had known family exposure to COVID - 19 . 63 Studies from Italy 64 and France 65 have also described similar cases of a hyperinflammatory syndrome with some evidence of previous COVID - 19 infection . Anecdotally , clusters have been noted in the USA and some centres in Spain . Symptoms reported include abdominal pain , vomiting and diarrhoea , with persistent high grade fever and commonly progression to shock with cardiac involvement . Children tend to have high inflammatory markers , myocarditis , macular popular rashes and non - suppurative conjunctivitis . Respiratory involvement does not seem to be present . Investigations are underway to ascertain a link and mechanism of disease . Further information can be found on the management of children presenting like this . The document details information on how to include cases you might be managing into research studies , such as the DIAMONDS study . How long after being exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 does a child develop symptoms ? The assumed incubation period ( time from exposure to index case to developing symptoms ) varies in different studies : it has been reported to be between 2 - 10 days , with median ( and mode ) of 7 days , 37 vs . 24h – 28d , 52 vs . mean of 10 days ( IQR 7 . 75 – 25 . 25 ) . 51 Can a child be asymptomatic but still have COVID - 19 ? Yes , there are reports of asymptomatic cases with positive laboratory confirmed COVID - 19 . 13 29 46 66 67 In the absence of widespread community or serological testing , it is uncertain what proportion of children do not have any symptoms or have sub - clinical symptoms . Testing of 120 asymptomatic cancer patients in a US cancer centre revealed 2 . 5 % to be positive ( vs . 14 . 7 % of their care givers ) . 25 What are blood and imaging tests of children with COVID - 19 likely to show ? Laboratory findings are non - specific , and often normal . They may include slightly elevated inflammatory markers including c - reactive protein , and raised liver transaminases . 34 46 Lymphocytopenia is seen , 3 52 68 but more children appear to have raised or normal lymphocyte counts . 30 34 42 43 46 69 70 Radiological investigations in infected children are also often normal . 34 50 53 However , findings may include features consistent with pneumonia such as ground glass opacities34 46 68 71 72 73 or consolidation45 53 ( commonly bilateral , but with less peripheral predominance than is reportedly found in adults ) and CT changes have been found in asymptomatic positive children . 69 There are several cases of reported co - infection of SARS - CoV - 2 and other respiratory viruses , which illustrates that the identification of another respiratory pathogen should not preclude SARS - CoV - 2 testing in children . If a swab is negative for COVID - 19 infection is it possible that a child has COVID - 19 infection ? We know that virtually no test is perfectly sensitive ( correctly picks up all people with the disease ) or specific ( correctly picks up all people who don’t have the disease ) and the same is true for COVID - 19 . The test that is used to confirm whether someone has COVID - 19 infection or not uses swabs from the back of the nose and throat . These are used to look for COVID - 19 genetic material in the cells that have been picked up , using a technique called reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) . It is possible to still have COVID - 19 infection even if the RT - PCR does not detect COVID - 19 genetic material , particularly very early or very late in the disease . 74 We don’t yet know exactly how sensitive or specific the RT - PCR test is at detecting COVID - 19 but if there is a high clinical suspicion of infection if a second swab improves the sensitivity . RT - PCR does not tell you if a child has been infected with COVID - 19 in the past . Blood tests are being developed to detect whether someone has or has had COVID - 19 infection . These have not yet been validated and are not currently in use in the UK . Once they come into general use they will give more information about the sensitivity and specificity of the swabs and how many people have had COVID - 19 infection already . Predictors of severity How many days into the illness is a child likely to be sickest ? We do not currently have sufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on this . Are there any factors that increase the risk of the child being severely affected , e . g . passive smoking ? We do not currently have sufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on this . Are there haematological or radiological findings which predict disease severity ? We do not currently have sufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on this . At risk groups Are there any groups that are at higher risk of developing severe COVID - 19 illness ? Data on COVID - 19 and children with underlying medical conditions is sparse and limited to case reports / series . Immunosuppression does not appear to significantly increase the risk of severe disease . 75 76 77 78 79 Contact tracing on a dialysis unit who had contact with a member of staff who tested positive found three children to be positive , but only one had symptoms . 80 A case report of a child with cystic fibrosis who contracted COVID - 19 from his grandfather , identified though contact tracing , also remained asymptomatic . 81 There is a case report of COVID - 19 pneumonia triggering acute chest syndrome in an adolescent with known sickle cell disease on daily hydroxyurea . 82 On screening patients and caregivers with cancer in one of the largest paediatric cancer centres in the US , 20 of 178 paediatric patients tested positive . Only one ( 5 % ) required hospitalisation for symptoms of COVID - 19 , with none requiring critical care . 25 Comorbidities identified among adults as increasing the risk of severe COVID - 19 may not apply to children . However , it is reasonable to expect that children with significant respiratory or cardiac conditions , or those who are immunocompromised due to disease or treatment , may be more vulnerable . CDC data from the USA reports that a high proportion of cases needing admission had at least one co - morbidity ( most commonly respiratory ) . 5 Data from Italy16 also finds that children with co - morbidities are over represented in those admitted to hospital , though most were reported to have mild illness . Notably there is no apparent difference in severity according to age in the Italian data , whereas CDC data5 noted increased hospitalisation in infants ( under one year of age ) and Dong et al67 who noted higher rate of severe or critical illness infants under one year of age . The RCPCH has provided guidance for more stringent social distancing among these groups . This guidance continues to be reviewed as new evidence emerges . What are the characteristics of children admitted to PICU ? Severe illness is far less frequent in children than adults , but it is still significant . Data on PICU admissions in Italy showed a higher proportion of those admitted to ITU had a co - morbidity ( 3 out of 4 children needing ICU admission in this case series ) . 41 In a cross sectional study of 46 North American PICUs , 83 between March 14 and April 3 2020 , 48 children were admitted to 14 PICUs in the US and none in Canada , with a median age of 13 ( 4 . 2 to 16 . 6 ) . Most presented with respiratory symptoms but there were other presentations , such as with vaso - occlusive crisis ( sickle cell ) and diabetic ketoacidosis . A total of 40 children ( 83 % ) had at least one pre - existing underlying medical condition . The most common comorbidity was medically complex , defined as children who had a long - term dependence on technological support ( including tracheostomy ) associated with developmental delay and / or genetic abnormalities . Of those , 20 % aged six years or older had obesity . A further 35 ( 73 % ) presented with respiratory symptoms and 18 ( 38 % ) required invasive ventilation . Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation was required for one patient ( 2 % ) . Two children died , so the overall ICU mortality rate was < 5 % ( vs . published mortalities of 50 - 62 % in adults admitted to ICU ) . For those who had been discharged at the time of publication of the paper , the median ( range ) length of PICU stay was five days ( three to nine days ) and the mean hospital length of stay seven days ( four to thirteen days ) . In summary , studies from PICU admissions in US and Italy have found that those with comorbidities are over represented , most commonly respiratory or complex neurodisability – groups which are otherwise at increased risk of complications from all respiratory viruses . The rates of complications from SARS - CoV - 2 infection do not appear disproportionate to those from other respiratory viruses from this early data . Neonatal Are neonates at increased risk of severe disease ? Many case reports / series have been published looking at the outcomes of pregnant mothers with COVID - 19 and their newborn babies . Mothers and their babies in general appear to do well and neonates without comorbidities do not appear to be at an increased risk of severe disease . 84 85 86 Can COVID - 19 increase the risk of pre - term birth , if the mother acquires it in the late second or third trimester ? There is a small increase in the rates of preterm birth , 87 however , the statistical significance of this is unclear . 88 One case series has described 10 infants delivered prematurely by COVID - 19 positive mothers , via emergency caesarean section , who had a more difficult neonatal course , including one death with disseminated intravascular coagulation . 89 All of these infants tested negative for SARS - CoV - 2 , and the reason for their premature delivery is unclear from the report . Can the virus be transmitted vertically ? As yet , cord blood , amniotic fluid and placental swabs of COVID - 19 positive mothers persistently tests negative for SARS - CoV - 2 and the vast majority of newborns have not acquired COVID - 19 themselves or had adverse outcomes . 76 77 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 There are a few cases of infants delivered to COVID - 19 positive mothers , who have elevated SARS - CoV - 2 IgM after birth , which may indicate intrauterine transmission but this is not clear because these babies tested negative on swab PCR and false positives with IgM are not uncommon . 105 106 There have also been cases of newborns and very young infants testing positive shortly after birth ( including several87 at or before 12 hours of age ) 2 85 107 however they have not suffered any known significant complications of the disease and mostly required minimal respiratory support . Can the virus be transmitted or through breast milk ? All reports of breast milk from COVID - 19 positive mothers have found that the breastmilk has tested negative for COVID - 19 so it would not appear that the virus can be transmitted through breast milk . 3 77 86 102 108 109 WHO continues to recommend breastfeeding with appropriate precautions for COVID - 19 positive mothers . Does having COVID - 19 in pregnancy cause any long - term problems for the baby ? We do not currently have sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on this . Therapeutics What treatments are available for children with COVID - 19 ? For those without severe disease , which will be most children , current conservative management is appropriate . What studies are enrolling children currently to therapeutic trials ? For those who develop more severe or critical illness ( RCPCH treatment criteria ) , please consider enrolment in the RECOVERY trial . This study is open at many sites including district general hospitals , and from 11 May will be including children down to those just born . If you are considering entering a child to RECOVERY , we suggest you check with your Regional Infectious Disease team and watch the relevant video ( s ) and view the FAQs on the study website . Please note that there are separate training videos in respect to children and infants of less than 29 days of age . If you are still uncertain about eligibility , there is the possibility for you to contact an ' on - call ' member of the study team to discuss further , but please only do this if you are particularly uncertain . If you think entry into RECOVERY is indicated , it can take place in the hospital where the child is admitted - you don ' t have to wait for them to be transferred to a regional centre . Is it safe to give ibuprofen to a child who has tested positive for COVID - 19 or is highly likely to be positive ? There is currently insufficient evidence to establish a link between use of ibuprofen , or other nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , and contracting or worsening of COVID - 19 . The RCPCH has made a statement about the use of ibuprofen in suspected / confirmed COVID - 19 . Is there an effective vaccine ? Vaccines will hopefully provide protection against future outbreaks of COVID - 19 , though these are still early in the drug development pipeline and unlikely to be available this year . Prognosis What is the prognosis of a child who has had COVID - 19 ? The short - term prognosis in those who recover appears to be good with both infants110 and children largely appearing to make a full recovery . 111 Are there any long - term complications ( in specific groups ) such as reduced exercise tolerance , developmental delay , or worsening of cardiac function ? We do not currently have sufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on this . Delayed access to care Is there any evidence that delayed access to or provision of care , as a result of the COVID - 19 pandemic , is causing children harm ? An Italian case series reports children identified whose parents reported avoiding accessing hospital due to concerns over SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 112 There is significant morbidity and mortality reported . Further evidence is required to ascertain the true presence and extent of this problem , which is a major concern around the world currently , across all age groups . Summary COVID - 19 does not appear to be as severe in children than in adults : children are often asymptomatic or have a mild course . There is evidence of critical illness and death , but it is rare . There is also some evidence that children may be less likely to acquire the infection . The role of children in transmission is unclear , and although it seems likely that they do not play a significant role , evidence that they are not a reservoir of disease does not exist . Symptoms are non - specific and most commonly cough and fever . Laboratory and radiological investigations may be normal or mildly altered . There is some evidence of infection in newborns which could indicate vertical transmission , but it is not clear if this is intrauterine or perinatal . Early evidence suggests both infected mothers and newborns are not particularly more severely affected than other groups . Early evidence suggests no significant increased risk for children with immunosuppression , but further data is needed . Children with respiratory and complex neurodisability appear more likely to suffer complications and need hospital + / - PICU admission , but not obviously more than would be expected from infection with other respiratory viruses . Next steps We will continue to collate and summarise the evidence around COVID - 19 and children and young people as it emerges , in partnership with The Don’t Forget the Bubbles team .
