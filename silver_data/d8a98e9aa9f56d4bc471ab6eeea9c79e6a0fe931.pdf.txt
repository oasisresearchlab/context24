The primal mark : How the beginning shapes the end in the development of creative ideas Justin M .

Introduction ‘‘If at ﬁrst the idea is not absurd , then there is no hope for it . ’’ [ - Albert Einstein ( Pritscher , 2010 : 57 ) ] As the world becomes more dynamic and competitive , organi - zations must continually generate creative ideas in order to keep up with ongoing pressures to be adaptive and innovative . To be deemed creative , an idea must be subjectively judged as high in both novelty ( degree to which the idea is unique from existing ideas ) and usefulness ( degree of value offered by the idea ) within the organization and broader domain in which it is embedded ( Amabile , 1996 ; Csikszentmihalyi , 1990 ; Ford , 1996 ) . Past research on creativity in organizations has tended to examine novelty and usefulness together in one overall creativity construct , assuming these two dimensions travel together in creative ideas ( e . g . , Oldham & Cummings , 1996 ; Shalley & Perry - Smith , 2001 ) . How - ever , scholars are increasingly recognizing that novelty and useful - ness often diverge ( Diehl & Stroebe , 1987 ; Ford & Gioia , 2000 ) , and tend to be conﬂicting dimensions in the evaluation of ideas ( Fleming , 2001 ; Mueller , Melwani , & Goncalo , 2012 ; Rietzschel , Nijstad , & Stroebe , 2010 ) . In short , ideas are often seen as either novel or useful , but may rarely be seen as high in both dimensions . Despite the abundant scholarly and practitioner attention paid to creativity , little theory and research has addressed when and why novelty and usefulness diverge in the development of ideas , nor how employees can overcome this tradeoff to construct ideas that are novel and useful . Building on theories of anchoring ( Northcraft & Neale , 1987 ; Tversky & Kahneman , 1974 ) , priming ( Chartrand & Bargh , 1996 ; Friedman , Fishbach , Förster , & Werth , 2003 ) , and design ﬁxation ( Ward , 1994 ; Ward , Smith , & Finke , 1999 ) , I propose that the ﬁnal novelty and usefulness of ideas depends on the seeds that are planted near the very beginning of creative tasks . In particular , the content that employees ﬁrst lay down as they set out to develop creative ideas may act as an anchor that shapes the novelty and usefulness of the ideas they ultimately produce . To capture this ﬁrst bit of content , I use the term ‘‘primal mark , ’’ which is borrowed from painting theory ( Strassberg , 1989 ) . The concept is that the ﬁrst brush stroke a pain - ter makes on a blank canvas , known as the primal mark , is espe - cially important because it shapes what the painter subsequently paints on the canvas . This parallels the notion that the initial raw material that employees use in creative tasks may anchor how they build their emerging ideas in ways that enable or constrain their novelty and usefulness . In this paper , I build and test hypotheses about the role of the primal mark in explaining the tradeoff between novelty and use - fulness and how it can be overcome to produce creative ideas that are high in both dimensions . In four experiments , participants started to develop ideas with primal marks that contained varying http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . obhdp . 2014 . 06 . 001 0749 - 5978 / ! 2014 Elsevier Inc .

The results offer three key implications for theory and research on creativity in organizations . First , the results shed light on pivotal anchoring effects in the creative process , illuminating how the ﬁrst bit of con - tent used in emerging ideas can have a powerful effect on the sub - sequent trajectory of novelty and usefulness . Second , rather than viewing novelty and usefulness as independent dimensions of cre - ative output , the results unearth key dynamics between these two dimensions throughout the creative process . Third , the results elu - cidate the importance of considering not only what knowledge is used , but also when it is used in the creative process . The primal mark Amabile’s ( 1996 ) model of the creative process posits that creative ideas are often developed in four basic stages : ( 1 ) task identiﬁcation ( deﬁning the creative problem at hand ) , ( 2 ) prepara - tion ( gathering and activating knowledge that might be relevant to the task ) , ( 3 ) response generation ( developing possible ideas by recombining elements from knowledge base ) , and ( 4 ) response val - idation ( elaborating and evaluating possible ideas until one is sat - isfactory ) . The primal mark is set at the transition point between the preparation and response generation stages , just as employees have a bit of content in mind and commit to further developing it into an emerging idea . Following theory and research on anchoring effects ( Mussweiler & Strack , 2000 ; Northcraft & Neale , 1987 ; Tversky & Kahneman , 1974 ) , the primal mark acts as an anchor that establishes the likely trajectory of novelty and usefulness for the idea that grows from it . Thus , within a given creative task , each possible idea that employees generate begins with a primal mark , and the only way employees can reset their primal mark is if they drop the emerging idea altogether and return to the preparation stage of the process . A considerable amount of past theory and research has focused on the impact of how creative tasks are framed in the task identi - ﬁcation stage , including work on goal setting ( e . g . , Madjar & Shalley , 2008 ; Shalley , 1995 ) , problem constructions ( e . g . , Csikszentmihalyi & Getzels , 1971 ; Mumford , Whetzel , & Reiter - Palmon , 1997 ) , and constraints ( e . g . , Medeiros , Partlow , & Mumford , 2014 ) . In essence , this past work has focused on framing effects , or ‘‘the ﬁnding that subjects often respond differently to different descriptions of the same problem’’ ( Frisch , 1993 , p . 399 ) . In contrast , rather than focusing on how creative tasks are framed , the primal mark concept draws attention to anchoring effects driven by the actual content or raw material initially used to build ideas within creative tasks . Focusing on anchoring effects—in addition to fram - ing effects—offers a valuable theoretical lens because the content that employees put in their primal marks may have anchoring effects that operate regardless of how the task has been framed . Parallel to the way numerical anchors exert disproportionate inﬂuence on the ﬁnal number chosen in numerical tasks ( e . g . , Northcraft & Neale , 1987 ; Tversky & Kahneman , 1974 ) , the initial content in the primal mark may impact novelty and usefulness disproportionately more than content added later in creative tasks . Despite the abundance of research on anchoring effects in numerical tasks , little research has addressed anchoring effects in creativity tasks . However , research from at least three literatures suggests that the initial content used in creative tasks may be key in anchoring the creativity of the ideas produced in the end . First , research on design ﬁxation suggests that when trying to develop new ideas , employees often take the path of least cognitive resistance and rely on familiar categories and schemas , limiting the novelty of any ‘‘new’’ ideas they generate ( e . g . , Baughman & Mumford , 1995 ; Finke , 1990 , 1995 ; Smith , Ward , & Schumacher , 1993 ) . Second , research on inadvertent plagiarism and conformity suggests that when employees are exposed to example ideas as they begin creative tasks , they involuntarily incorporate aspects of the examples into their ideas ( Kohn & Smith , 2011 ; Marsh , Ward , & Landau , 1999 ) . Third , research on functional ﬁxedness suggests that once employees associate a form with a given function , their thinking gets trapped within the form - function rela - tionship and they have trouble thinking of any other functions that the form could serve ( Adamson , 1952 ; Duncker , 1945 ; German & Barrett , 2005 ) . The underlying suggestion of this past theory and research is that starting with familiar content in mind when generating ideas constrains the creativity of any ideas that are ultimately devel - oped . The primal mark concept integrates and extends beyond this past work in two key ways . First , these past perspectives have focused on how the initial content used impacts the subse - quent novelty of ideas , overlooking the usefulness dimension of creativity in organizations . When usefulness is also considered , familiar content may be a blessing—not just a curse—for creativ - ity . Thus , the primal mark concept examines how the initial content in emerging ideas anchors the trajectory of both novelty and usefulness . Second , whereas past perspectives have focused principally on how initial content constrains creativity , the primal mark concept highlights how initial content can constrain or enable creativity ( depending on how it anchors the trajectory of novelty and usefulness ) . By allowing novelty and usefulness to be constrained or enabled , the primal mark concept may help tell a more complete story of how the initial content employees use in their emerging ideas inﬂuences the creativity of their ideas in the end . In the following section , I build hypotheses on how distinguish - ing between familiar vs . new primal marks—and the anchoring effects triggered by each—can help explain when and why novelty and usefulness diverge in creative tasks . The content of familiar primal marks is derived mainly from ideas that are already well known and conventional within the focal domain . The content of new primal marks is derived mainly from ideas that are novel to the domain , perhaps because they come from another domain . Later , I build hypotheses on how integrative primal marks , which combine content from familiar and new ideas , may help employees overcome the novelty – usefulness tradeoff . Fig . 1 provides a visual summary of all the hypotheses . Experiment 1 : Familiar vs . new primal marks in the divergence of novelty and usefulness Scholars have long recognized that creative ideas come from recombining elements of existing ideas ( Koestler , 1964 ; Welch , 1946 ) . As Weick ( 1979 , p . 252 ) states , developing creative ideas entails ‘‘putting new things in old combinations and old things in new combinations . ’’ However , starting with ‘‘old things’’ ( i . e . , familiar primal marks ) may have very different implications than starting with ‘‘new things’’ ( i . e . , new primal marks ) . Within any organization , ideas get developed and circulated to serve the pur - poses of people in one or more broader domains ( Burt , 1992 , 2004 ) . Over time , some ideas gain legitimacy and become taken for granted within the domain ( Meyer & Rowan , 1977 ) . These familiar ideas are represented in the mind as schemas—i . e . , mental frameworks for organizing and processing knowledge ( Thorndyke , 1984 ) . As ideas become more familiar to employees , they form richer and more elaborate schemas of them ( Tversky & Hemenway , 1984 ) , making the familiar ideas more likable 2 J . M . Berg / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 125 ( 2014 ) 1 – 17 ( Zajonc , 1968 ; Monahan , Murphy , & Zajonc , 2000 ) , memorable ( Bornstein & D’Agostino , 1992 ) , and difﬁcult to change ( Ward , 1994 ) . Consequently , within any mature organization and domain , employees are embedded in a constellation of familiar ideas that they carry around in their minds as relatively vivid , readily avail - able , and ﬁxed schemas . When employees lay down a familiar primal mark , they may anchor their thinking within such a constellation of familiar ideas . Because familiar ideas are more readily available in mem - ory than more novel ideas ( Schwarz et al . , 1991 ; Tversky & Kahneman , 1973 ) , the vivid schemas that they associate with the familiar elements in the primal mark are likely to come to mind ( Tversky & Hemenway , 1984 ) . Thus , employees may be primed to have familiar schemas dominate their thinking as they develop their ideas , diminishing the ease with which any rela - tively novel elements or associations may come to mind as they ﬂesh out their emerging ideas ( e . g . , Chartrand & Bargh , 1996 ; Friedman et al . , 2003 ) . In other words , familiar primal marks may anchor employees’ thinking such that the path of least cog - nitive resistance is to only consider ideas that are closely related to the familiar primal mark ( Ward et al . , 1999 ) . Because employ - ees tend to take the basic structure of familiar ideas for granted ( Finke , 1990 ; Ward , 1994 ) , they are likely to get ‘‘stuck in the weeds’’ and focus on relatively minor modiﬁcations to any famil - iar ideas that come to mind ( Förster , 2009 ) . While this may promote convergent thinking that helps them identify useful improvements to familiar ideas ( Cropley , 2006 ) , remaining within the basic boundaries of familiar schemas may come at the expense of novelty . Whereas familiar primal marks are likely to anchor employees’ thinking within familiar schemas , primal marks derived mainly from novel content—i . e . , new primal marks—may anchor their thinking in a constellation of schemas that are relatively novel to the domain ( Tversky & Hemenway , 1984 ) . Because employees are unlikely to have conventional associations with the content in new primal marks , they are unlikely to have familiar schemas dominate their thinking as they develop their ideas ( Schwarz et al . , 1991 ; Tversky & Kahneman , 1973 ; Ward , 1994 ) . Instead , as employees ﬂesh out new primal marks , the path of least cognitive resistance is likely to include elements of relatively novel ideas that they associate with the content of the new primal mark . In this way , new primal marks may enable employees to escape the anchoring effects of familiar schemas early in creative tasks , which may help them see opportunities for recombining elements of ideas in more fundamental and divergent ways ( Förster , 2009 ; Friedman et al . , 2003 ) . However , the highly novel ideas that result may be perceived as low in usefulness , as others in the domain may lack the schemas to understand and appreciate them ( Hargadon & Douglas , 2001 ) . Taken together , these arguments sug - gest a novelty – usefulness tradeoff : familiar primal marks favor usefulness at the expense of novelty , while new primal marks favor novelty at the expense of usefulness . Hypothesis 1 . New primal marks lead to ﬁnal ideas that are more novel than familiar primal marks . Hypothesis 2 . New primal marks lead to ﬁnal ideas that are less useful than familiar primal marks . Fig . 1 . Trajectories of familiar , new , and integrative primal marks . Note : While N ! and U ! are theoretical midpoints when the number of possible ideas is theoretically inﬁnite , for a ﬁnite sample of ideas , N ! and U ! can be operationalized as the means of perceived novelty and usefulness respectively . J . M . Berg / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 125 ( 2014 ) 1 – 17 3 Method Participants and procedures This ﬁrst experiment was designed to test H1 and H2 . Participants were 185 university students ( 57 . 8 % female ) , ranging in age from 18 to 34 years ( M = 20 . 66 , SD = 1 . 64 ) . The experiment followed a 2 ( primal mark : new , familiar ) " 2 ( creative problem : new , familiar ) factorial design with both factors varied between subjects . The novelty of the creative problem at hand was manipu - lated to help differentiate framing effects in the task identiﬁcation stage from the subsequent anchoring effects of the primal mark . Research on problem constructions suggests that when creative tasks are framed around a novel problem / goal , the ideas produced are more creative in the end ( Csikszentmihalyi & Getzels , 1971 ; Mumford et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , the effects of the primal mark were tested within a relatively new problem and a more familiar problem to help test the discriminant validity of the primal mark concept and the robustness of its anchoring effects on novelty and usefulness . The procedures were designed to foster both mundane and psy - chological realism ( Berkowitz & Donnerstein , 1982 ) . To foster mundane realism , the task was designed to mirror Amabile’s ( 1996 ) aforementioned four - stage model of the creative process , as empirical evidence suggests employees often develop creative ideas through these four basic stages ( Lubart , 2001 ) . To foster psy - chological realism , the creative task was from a domain about which participants had fairly extensive knowledge—their univer - sity bookstore—and participants were informed that their product ideas would be passed along to the bookstore . Participants were guided through the procedures by a comput - erized survey . First , participants were informed that the university bookstore was looking for creative ideas for an innovative product to sell to students . Following evidence that creativity is facilitated by explicit goals to produce novel and appropriate / useful output ( Shalley , 1991 ) , participants were told that their goal was to develop a novel and useful idea . While all participants started the task identiﬁcation stage with this same information , to manip - ulate the creative problem at hand , participants were either informed that the bookstore was looking for product ideas that will help roommates stay organized ( familiar problem ) or help room - mates get along better ( new problem ) . Then , during the prepara - tion stage , to manipulate the primal mark , all participants were told : ‘‘It is helpful to use aspects of existing products as inspiration for coming up with ideas for a new product . So , when coming up with your different ideas , start with one or more elements of the product pictured below . ’’ For the familiar primal mark conditions , the photo was a white / cork board , and for the new primal mark conditions , the photo was a ﬁshing pole . These stimuli were selected from a pretest of 40 photos of prod - ucts and 26 problems , which were rated by a separate sample of 30 university students . Half of the possible photos for the primal mark manipulations were of products already sold in the bookstore and half were products from other domains . Similarly , half the possible problems had conventional associations with products already sold in the bookstore ( e . g . , helping students show school pride ) and half were associated with products from other domains ( e . g . , helping students meet new people ) . Respondents rated the possible prod - ucts on novelty—or the degree to which they saw each product as novel ( vs . conventional ) for the bookstore domain . They rated the possible problems on novelty and potential usefulness—or the degree to which students would ﬁnd a product to be useful if it solved the given problem . Both novelty and potential usefulness were rated on a 7 - point scale ( 1 = ‘‘very low’’ , 7 = ‘‘very high’’ ) . To foster fair comparisons between conditions ( Cooper & Richardson , 1986 ) , the familiar and new problems were selected to differ in novelty but not in potential usefulness , such that partic - ipants in all conditions started with an equally high ceiling on use - fulness . The new stimulus pretested as signiﬁcantly more novel than the familiar one for both the primal mark , t ( 29 ) = 18 . 09 , p < . 00001 , d = 4 . 01 , and the problem , t ( 29 ) = 11 . 10 , p < . 00001 , d = 1 . 96 , but the two problems did not signiﬁcantly differ in poten - tial usefulness , t ( 29 ) = 0 . 13 , p = . 42 . Next , in the response generation stage , participants were asked to generate a list of at least three different ideas , then choose one of the ideas to further develop . Asking for at least three different ideas was intended to strengthen the primal mark manipulations by encouraging deeper processing of the task , as well as foster higher - quality ideas based on evidence that quantity can boost quality in creative tasks ( Beaty & Silvia , 2012 ; Paulus , Kohn , & Arditti , 2011 ) . In all four experiments , at least 97 % of participants generated three ideas , and no participants generated more than ﬁve ideas . Also , the percentage of participants who selected the ﬁrst , second , third , fourth , or ﬁfth idea they generated did not sig - niﬁcantly differ between conditions in all four experiments . The response generation stage concluded with participants selecting one of their nascent ideas to further develop , carrying the primal mark they set in generating the idea with it into the response validation stage . In the response validation stage , all participants were asked to spend at least 5 min developing their nascent idea on scratch paper . To help embed participants in the bookstore domain and thus simulate what employees typically experience when trying to elaborate creative ideas in organizations , participants were shown photos of nine different products that were sold in the bookstore and were told that they should feel free to consider these products as they develop their idea . To help control the amount of time participants spent elaborating their ideas across conditions , they could not advance until 5 min had passed . After participants ﬁnished developing their idea on scratch paper , they described their ﬁnalized idea on the other side of the paper . Measures Amabile’s ( 1996 ) consensual assessment technique was used to measure the novelty and usefulness of participants’ ideas . Since the viewpoints of both the bookstore and its customers are important in determining the usefulness of products in this domain , raters were recruited to provide both of these perspectives . Speciﬁcally , a total of nine expert raters assessed the ﬁnal ideas , including three managers from the bookstore ( General Manager , Assistant General Manager , and Purchasing Manager ) and six customers of the book - store . The three managers averaged 14 years of experience work - ing in university bookstores , and six years in this particular bookstore . The six customers had all been undergraduates at the university for at least two years , and they all extensively reviewed the products sold by the bookstore before rating . In addition , a separate set of three undergraduates rated participants’ selected nascent ideas . All of the raters were blind to the hypotheses and procedures of the study , and each rater received the same set of instructions . Fol - lowing suggested practice , each rater assessed the ideas in a differ - ent randomized order , and looked over 15 ideas before rating ( Amabile , 1996 ) . Novelty and usefulness were each rated using the same 1 – 7 scale ( 1 = ‘‘very low’’ , 4 = ‘‘moderate’’ , 7 = ‘‘very high’’ ) . Both dimensions were deﬁned broadly to ensure that they were equally relevant to both managers and customers , but also in a way that accounted for context . Novelty was deﬁned as : ‘‘The degree to which the idea is unique from other products , especially compared to products sold in the bookstore , but also compared to products that exist in general . How original is the idea ? ’’ 4 J . M . Berg / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 125 ( 2014 ) 1 – 17 Usefulness was deﬁned as : ‘‘The degree of value offered by the idea . How useful would this product be if it was sold in the book - store ? ’’ Three of the customers also rated the ﬁnal ideas on overall creativity , deﬁned as : ‘‘Overall degree to which the idea is both novel and useful . How innovative is the idea in the university bookstore domain ? ’’ The manager and customer ratings were highly correlated ( r = . 65 for novelty , and r = . 67 for usefulness ) , and thus were averaged together to provide a consensual assessment of novelty and usefulness from both of these key stakeholders in the domain ( Amabile , 1996 ) . 1 Each set of raters met conventional standards for reliability and agreement—see Table 1 ( LeBreton & Senter , 2008 ) . Both novelty and usefulness showed a fair amount of stability over time , as nascent novelty and ﬁnal novelty were signiﬁcantly correlated , as were nascent usefulness and ﬁnal usefulness . Final ideas that were rated high in novelty but low in usefulness included a trash can on wheels that could be retrieved from across the room using a magnet , as well as a pulley system between roommates beds’ for sharing notes and food items . Final ideas rated low in novelty but high in usefulness included a digital electronic whiteboard and a bookshelf with whiteboard sides . Final ideas rated high in both novelty and usefulness included an adjustable room divider , as well as an electronic ‘‘communication sign’’ for the door that roommates could use with a wireless remote control . Means by condition are in Table 2 . Results To test H1 ( new primal marks yield more novel ideas than familiar primal marks ) , a between - subjects ANOVA was used , crossing the primal mark and the problem with ﬁnal novelty as the dependent variable ( see Table 3 ) . Because H1 is concerned with the variance that novelty and usefulness do not share , ﬁnal useful - ness was included as a control to account for any spillover between the two dimensions . This revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for the primal mark , F ( 1 , 180 ) = 32 . 20 , p < . 00001 , g 2 = . 15 . As predicted in H1 , new primal marks ( M = 3 . 82 , SD = 1 . 06 ) led to ﬁnal ideas that were higher in novelty than familiar primal marks ( M = 3 . 05 , SD = 1 . 00 ) . To test H2 ( new primal marks yield less useful ideas than familiar primal marks ) , the same ANOVA was used , but with ﬁnal usefulness as the dependent variable and ﬁnal novelty as a control . This revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for the primal mark , F ( 1 , 180 ) = 6 . 23 , p = . 01 , g 2 = . 03 . As predicted in H2 , new primal marks ( M = 3 . 65 , SD = 1 . 03 ) led to ﬁnal ideas that were lower in usefulness than familiar primal marks ( M = 4 . 06 , SD = 0 . 69 ) . In sum , the results from Experiment 1 support H1 and H2 . However , it is possible that these results were driven by idiosyn - crasies in the stimuli used in the manipulations , rather than the psychological effects of new vs . familiar primal marks . Thus , Experiment 2 was designed to not only test H3 and H4 ( which are developed below ) , but also to constructively replicate H1 and H2 by using different stimuli in the manipulations .

J . M . Berg / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 125 ( 2014 ) 1 – 17 5 Experiment 2 : Increasing the usefulness of ideas from new primal marks The results from Experiment 1 suggest that familiar primal marks anchor the novelty of ideas low but the usefulness of ideas high , whereas new primal marks anchor novelty high but useful - ness low . This raises the question : Can employees boost the nov - elty of ideas from familiar primal marks or the usefulness of ideas from new primal marks ? Because familiar ideas tend to come to mind as relatively vivid , coherent , and ﬁxed schemas ( Tversky & Hemenway , 1984 ; Ward , 1994 ) , the anchoring effect of familiar primal marks on novelty may be relatively difﬁcult to overcome . In contrast , the anchoring effect of new primal marks on usefulness may be easier to overcome . The key to boosting the usefulness of ideas from new primal marks may be what design scholars call ‘‘skeuomorphs , ’’ which are familiar cues embedded in novel ideas that help individuals understand and appreciate novel ideas by leveraging their existing schemas ( Heskett , 2003 ) . For example , when it was novel , the concept of a computer ‘‘Desktop’’ was added to operating systems to tap individuals’ existing schemas of a desk - top in physical space . After employees set new primal marks , they may be able to increase the usefulness of their emerging ideas by elaborating them with familiar elements , which may infuse the novel ideas with greater meaning , clarity , and legitimacy ( Hargadon & Douglas , 2001 ; McKinley , Mone , & Moon , 1999 ) . Moreover , elaborating new primal marks with familiar elements may increase usefulness without decreasing novelty . Because new primal marks anchor the development process around one or more novel elements , the novel element ( s ) are placed at the foundation of the emerging idea . Thus , any familiar elements that are incorpo - rated will be folded into a relatively novel emerging idea . In other words , the familiar elements may become components of what is already a novel idea , helping others understand and appreciate the idea , thereby boosting usefulness without sacriﬁcing novelty . Hypothesis 3 . Elaborating nascent ideas from new primal marks with familiar elements increases the usefulness of the ﬁnal ideas that result . Hypothesis 4 . When elaborated with familiar elements , ﬁnal ideas from new primal marks are still higher in novelty than ﬁnal ideas from familiar primal marks . Table 3 Experiment 1 : ANOVA results .

In addition , the new primal mark , familiar problem condition led to ideas that were signiﬁcantly more novel than both familiar primal mark conditions : new problem , [ M = 0 . 50 , CI . 95 ( 0 . 09 , 0 . 92 ) , p = . 02 , d = 0 . 47 ] , and familiar problem , [ M = 0 . 52 , CI . 95 ( 0 . 11 , 0 . 93 ) , p = . 01 , d = 0 . 52 ] . However , the new primal mark , familiar problem condition was not signiﬁcantly different from the two familiar primal mark conditions in ﬁnal usefulness . These results suggest that new problems strengthen the anchoring effects of new primal marks , such that setting new primal marks to address new problems yields ideas that are even more novel—and even less useful—than setting new primal marks to address relatively familiar problems .

M . Berg / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 125 ( 2014 ) 1 – 17 Method Participants and procedures This second experiment was designed to test H3 and H4 , as well as constructively replicate H1 and H2 . Participants were 196 uni - versity students ( 68 . 9 % female ) , ranging in age from 18 to 25 ( M = 19 . 60 , SD = 1 . 39 ) . The design was the same as Experiment 1 , but in addition to the novelty of the primal mark and problem framing , I also manipulated whether or not participants were encouraged to elaborate their primal marks with familiar ele - ments . Thus , the experiment followed a 2 ( primal mark : new , familiar ) " 2 ( problem : new , familiar ) " 2 ( familiarity infusion : with , without ) factorial design . Participants went through the same basic procedures as Exper - iment 1 , except during the response validation stage when they elaborated their selected ideas for at least 5 min . During this step , participants were either shown photos of familiar products and encouraged to incorporate elements of them into their ideas or they were not shown photos nor given encouragement to incorpo - rate familiar elements ( in Experiment 1 , they were shown familiar products but were not explicitly directed to incorporate them ) . Speciﬁcally , participants in the four conditions with familiarity infusion ( as opposed to without familiarity infusion ) were told : ‘‘When developing creative ideas , it helps to recombine and incor - porate elements of existing ideas . So , to help develop your idea , try to incorporate elements of the bookstore products below as much as possible . ’’ To help foster motivation and psychological realism across conditions , a rafﬂe prize was also introduced . Following sug - gested practice , this extrinsic reward was not introduced until the validation stage of the creative process and was explicitly tied to creative performance ( Amabile , 1996 ) . In particular , participants in all conditions were told : ‘‘Note that if your ﬁnal idea is highly creative , you will be entered into a rafﬂe for a $ 100 iTunes gift card . To qualify for the rafﬂe , your idea must be considered both very novel and very useful . ’’ Also , to help rule out the possibility that the effects from Exper - iment 1 were driven by idiosyncrasies of the stimuli , different stimuli were used in the manipulations . For the primal mark , I used a 3 - ring binder ( familiar ) vs . an in - line skate ( new ) , and for the problem , I used helping students do well in classes ( familiar ) vs . job interviews ( new ) . The new stimulus pretested as signiﬁcantly more novel than the familiar one for both the primal mark , t ( 29 ) = 29 . 58 , p < . 00001 , d = 7 . 31 , and problem , t ( 29 ) = 2 . 36 , p = . 03 , d = 0 . 37 , and the two problems did not signiﬁcantly differ in potential usefulness , t ( 29 ) = 1 . 19 , p = . 24 . Lastly , the nine famil - iar products pictured in the familiarity infusion conditions were products sold in the bookstore ( e . g . , 3 - hole puncher , calculator , index cards , etc . ) . These products were selected because they were relevant to helping students in classes ( familiar problem ) and could be analogically linked to helping students in job interviews ( new problem ) with relative ease . Measures Like Experiment 1 , three managers and six customers rated the ﬁnal ideas on novelty and usefulness ( three of the customers rated overall creativity as well ) , and a separate set of three customers rated the selected nascent ideas . Each set of raters met conventional standards for both reliability and agreement—see Table 1 ( LeBreton & Senter , 2008 ) . The manager and customer ratings were again highly correlated ( r = . 70 for novelty , and r = . 58 for usefulness ) , and were averaged together to provide a consensual assessment of ﬁnal novelty and usefulness ( Amabile , 1996 ) . Final ideas that were rated high in novelty but low in usefulness included a Velcro arm strap with pouches for business cards , as well as ‘‘hand socks’’ to absorbsweat while students nervously await interviews . Final ideas rated low in novelty but high in usefulness included a binder made especially for organizing resources for job interviews , as well as a book stand on wheels that makes it easy to move books around a workspace . Final ideas rated high in both novelty and usefulness included a notepad with voice recognition that discretely reminds the interviewee how much each person has talked during the inter - view , as well as a pen with small nodules that retract as time passes , helping the interviewee know how much time is left ( see Appendix for example visuals ) . Means by condition are in Table 4 . Results To test H1 , an ANOVA was used—crossing primal mark , prob - lem , and familiarity infusion—with ﬁnal novelty as the dependent variable and ﬁnal usefulness as a control ( see Table 5 ) . This revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for the primal mark , F ( 1 , 187 ) = 35 . 93 , p < . 00001 , g 2 = . 16 . As predicted in H1 , new pri - mal marks ( M = 4 . 01 , SD = 1 . 03 ) led to ﬁnal ideas that were higher in novelty than familiar primal marks ( M = 3 . 27 , SD = 0 . 89 ) . To test H2 and H3 ( elaborating new primal marks with familiar elements increases usefulness ) , the same ANOVA was conducted but with ﬁnal usefulness as the dependent variable and ﬁnal novelty as a control ( see Table 5 ) . As predicted in H2 and H3 respectively , this revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for the primal mark , F ( 1 , 187 ) = 20 . 87 , p < . 00001 , g 2 = . 10 , and a signiﬁcant two - way interaction between the primal mark and familiarity infusion , F ( 1 , 187 ) = 9 . 18 , p = . 003 , g 2 = . 05 . As predicted in H2 , new primal marks ( M = 3 . 83 , SD = 0 . 92 ) led to ﬁnal ideas that were lower in usefulness than familiar primal marks ( M = 4 . 21 , SD = 0 . 58 ) . As pre - dicted in H3 , a planned t - test revealed new primal marks that received a familiarity infusion led to ﬁnal ideas that were signiﬁ - cantly higher in usefulness ( M = 4 . 17 , SD = 1 . 01 ) than ﬁnal ideas from new primal marks that did not receive a familiarity infusion ( M = 3 . 48 , SD = 0 . 66 ) , t ( 93 ) = # 3 . 97 , p = . 0001 , d = # 0 . 81 . In con - trast , for ideas from familiar primal marks , there was not a signif - icant difference in ﬁnal usefulness between the with ( M = 4 . 21 , SD = 0 . 45 ) vs . without ( M = 4 . 20 , SD = 0 . 70 ) familiarity infusion conditions , t ( 99 ) = # 0 . 10 , p = . 92 . To test H4 ( infusing new primal marks with familiarity yields ideas that are still more novel than ideas from familiar primal marks ) , a planned t - test was conducted comparing the ﬁnal nov - elty of the two new primal mark with familiarity infusion condi - tions ( M = 4 . 12 , SD = 0 . 98 ) to the four familiar primal mark conditions ( M = 3 . 27 , SD = 0 . 89 ) . As predicted , ideas from the new primal mark with familiarity infusion conditions were signiﬁcantly higher in ﬁnal novelty than ideas from familiar primal marks , t ( 147 ) = 5 . 24 , p < . 00001 , d = 0 . 91 . In addition , Tukey HSD tests between the new primal mark with familiarity infusion conditions and each of the four familiar primal mark conditions were all sig - niﬁcant in the predicted direction ( see Table 4 ) . In sum , the results from Experiment 2 constructively replicate H1 and H2 , as well as support H3 and H4 . Experiment 3 : Infusing novelty into familiar primal marks To test the possibility that the novelty of ideas from familiar pri - mal marks may be increased through infusing new elements , a third experiment was conducted . Participants were 206 university students ( 58 . 3 % female ) , ranging in age from 18 to 30 ( M = 20 . 04 , SD = 1 . 92 ) . The same manipulations from Experiment 2 were used . However , in ﬂeshing out their primal marks , participants were encouraged to infuse elements of nine products from outside the bookstore domain , which all pretested above the median in nov - elty ( e . g . , a piano , Swiss army knife , Legos , etc . ) . Three bookstore customers rated participants’ selected nascent ideas , and a sepa - rate set of six customers rated their ﬁnal ideas—three of the six J . M . Berg / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 125 ( 2014 ) 1 – 17 7 rated the ﬁnal ideas on overall creativity in addition to novelty and usefulness ( see Table 1 for interrater statistics ) . To test whether familiar primal marks still anchor novelty even when new elements are infused , an ANOVA was conducted , cross - ing the primal mark ( new or familiar ) and problem ( new or famil - iar ) with ﬁnal novelty as the dependent variable and ﬁnal usefulness as a control . This revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for the primal mark , F ( 1 , 201 ) = 28 . 00 , p < . 00001 , g 2 = . 12 . As expected , familiar primal marks ( M = 2 . 69 , SD = 1 . 01 ) yielded less novel ﬁnal ideas than new primal marks ( M = 3 . 72 , SD = 1 . 20 ) . In addition , a paired - samples t - test revealed that ideas from familiar primal marks did not signiﬁcantly change in novelty from nascent ( M = 2 . 67 , SD = 1 . 49 ) to ﬁnal ( M = 2 . 69 , SD = 1 . 01 ) , t ( 103 ) = 0 . 23 , p = . 82 . These results suggest that familiar primal marks anchor Table 4 Experiment 2 : Means , temporal changes , and Tukey HSD results .

M . Berg / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 125 ( 2014 ) 1 – 17 novelty lower than new primal marks even if new elements are infused after the primal mark , providing additional support for H1 . The results from Experiment 3 also provide additional support for H2 , in that new primal marks led to ﬁnal ideas that were signif - icantly lower in usefulness than familiar primal marks ( see Table 7 ) . Taken together , the results for H1 – H4 suggest that novelty is more rigidly anchored by the primal mark than usefulness . Thus , the best solution to the novelty – usefulness tradeoff would seem to be setting a new primal mark and elaborating it with familiar elements . Indeed , in Experiments 1 – 3 , new primal marks yielded ideas signiﬁcantly higher in overall creativity than familiar primal marks ( see Tables 2 , 4 and 6 ) . Furthermore , in Experiment 2 , new primal marks with familiarity infusion ( M = 3 . 92 , SD = 0 . 87 ) yielded ideas signiﬁcantly higher in overall creativity than new primal marks without familiarity infusion ( M = 3 . 44 , SD = 0 . 95 ) , t ( 93 ) = 2 . 49 , p = . 01 , d = 0 . 53 . This suggests that the boost in useful - ness from infusing familiarity helps increase the overall creativity of ideas from new primal marks . However , this approach may come with the risk of producing ideas that are relatively more novel than they are useful , especially because some new primal marks may anchor usefulness more rigidly than others . This raises the question : What primal marks anchor the trajectory of emerg - ing ideas such that novelty and usefulness ( and thus overall creativity ) are maximized ? Experiment 4 : Integrative primal marks and overcoming the novelty – usefulness tradeoff In addition to primal marks that are principally derived from familiar or new content , employees may set integrative primal marks by combining familiar and new content into one primal mark . To do so , they likely have to engage in analogical thinking , which is conducive to identifying novel connections between pre - viously distinct ideas ( Dahl & Moreau , 2002 ; Thompson , Gentner , & Loewenstein , 2000 ) . When thinking analogically , individuals search for higher - level , abstract parallels between two or more ideas , as opposed to similarities between the lower - level literal attributes of the ideas ( Gentner , 1989 ) . Integrative primal marks are set when elements of familiar and new ideas are analogically combined into one emerging idea . Whereas familiar or new primal marks may lead to analogical thinking after the primal mark is set ( as additional elements are infused ) , analogical thinking is required in the actual creation of integrative primal marks . Because ele - ments of familiar and new ideas are unlikely to share many literal attributes with one another , trying to recombine familiar and new elements may prime employees to think analogically in integra - tively complex ways ( Miron - Spektor , Gino , & Argote , 2011 ; Tetlock , 1983 ) . This complex analogical thinking may foster the identiﬁcation of more fundamental—and thus more novel—ways of recombining the familiar and new content into one emerging idea . Thus , regardless of whether they address a new or familiar problem , integrative primal marks anchor the development process around a novel recombination of elements . In turn , the novelty of ideas from integrative primal marks should remain relatively high as they are developed , because any familiar elements that are added will be folded into an already novel recombination . Integrative primal marks may also facilitate the rise of useful - ness more than new primal marks . Because the core of integrative primal marks includes one or more familiar elements , employees should have a constellation of familiar schemas that they and others in the domain already associate with central aspects of the primal mark . Employees can leverage these familiar schemas to enhance the clarity , meaning , legitimacy—and thus usefulness—of their emerging ideas . For example , through analogical thinking , medical researchers realized that technology created by NASA for the Hubble Telescope to pinpoint speciﬁc stars was parallel to the challenge of ﬁnding abnormal tissue in mammograms—both involve detecting small signals amid a wide range of noise ( NASA , 1997 ) . This led medical researchers to set an integrative primal mark , in which they analogically combined elements of the Hubble technology ( new content ) and mammogram testing ( familiar con - tent ) into one emerging idea . The researchers were able to leverage doctors’ familiar schemas of mammogram testing to enhance the usefulness of the new technology in pinpointing abnormal spots of tissue . This yielded an idea that was seen as highly novel and use - ful in the medical domain ( NASA , 1997 ) . Table 6 Experiment 3 : Means and temporal changes by condition .

J . M . Berg / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 125 ( 2014 ) 1 – 17 9 In sum , familiar and new primal marks help explain why employees often face a novelty – usefulness tradeoff : familiar pri - mal marks send ideas toward usefulness but away from novelty , while new primal marks send ideas toward novelty but away from usefulness . Integrative primal marks , however , send ideas toward an optimal balance of novelty and usefulness . In this way , integra - tive primal marks plant the seeds for greater novelty than familiar primal marks , greater usefulness than new primal marks , and thus greater overall creativity than both familiar and new primal marks . Hypothesis 5 . When elaborated with familiar elements , integra - tive primal marks lead to ﬁnal ideas that are ( a ) more novel than ﬁnal ideas from familiar primal marks , and ( b ) more useful than ﬁnal ideas from new primal marks . Hypothesis 6 . When elaborated with familiar elements , integra - tive primal marks lead to ﬁnal ideas that are more creative overall than ﬁnal ideas from ( a ) familiar primal marks , and ( b ) new primal marks . Method Participants and procedures This fourth experiment was designed to test H5 and H6 , as well as constructively replicate key results from Experiments 1 – 3 . Par - ticipants were 226 university students ( 63 . 3 % female ) , ranging in age from 18 to 32 years ( M = 20 . 12 , SD = 1 . 88 ) . The experiment fol - lowed a 4 ( primal mark : new , familiar , integrative , familiar - analogy ) " 2 ( problem : new , familiar ) factorial design . The famil - iar - analogy conditions were included to help rule out the possibil - ity that the effects of integrative primal marks are driven by analogical thinking in general , as opposed to speciﬁcally analogical thinking between new and familiar content . Participants went through the same basic procedures as Experiments 1 – 3 , but with four key differences that were intended to build on Experiments 1 – 3 . First , because the creative task in Experiments 1 – 3 involved relatively concrete ideas ( i . e . , tangible bookstore products ) , the task in Experiment 4 involved ideas that were relatively abstract in nature . Speciﬁcally , participants were asked to develop a creative idea for evaluating applicants to their university , and were informed that their idea would be sent along to the admissions ofﬁce for their consideration . Second , to help mitigate the threat of demand characteristics in the primal mark manipulations , participants were told that the concept ( s ) they were given were randomly selected . Third , while past research suggests that setting explicit goals to produce ideas that are both novel and useful can facilitate creativity ( Shalley , 1991 ) , it is possi - ble that setting these dual goals may affect certain types of primal marks more than others . Thus , in Experiment 4 , participants were just asked to develop a ‘‘creative idea , ’’ as opposed to an idea that is both novel and useful . Fourth , because extrinsic rewards may focus participants on usefulness more than novelty , the rafﬂe prize was not included in Experiment 4 . To manipulate the primal mark , while generating their list of at least three nascent ideas , participants in the familiar and new pri - mal mark conditions were asked to ‘‘ . . . start each idea with one or more aspects of the randomly - selected concept below . ’’ Then in large font below these instructions , the familiar primal mark con - ditions saw ‘‘Interview’’ , while the new primal mark conditions saw ‘‘Board Game’’ . In contrast , participants in the integrative and familiar - analogy conditions were asked to ‘‘ . . . start each idea by combining aspects of the two randomly - selected concepts below . ’’ Then in large font below , the integrative primal mark con - ditions saw both the familiar and new concepts—i . e . , ‘‘Interview’’ and ‘‘Board Game’’ . The familiar - analogy conditions saw two familiar concepts—i . e . , the same one used in other conditions ( ‘‘Interview’’ ) , as well as an additional familiar concept that was just used in the familiar - analogy conditions ( ‘‘Recommendation Letter’’ ) . The order of the two concepts was randomized in both the integrative and familiar - analogy conditions . To make the task of recombining the two concepts feasible and realistic , the con - cepts in each pair were intended to share some similarities ( the integrative pair involves interaction between people , the familiar pair involves communication of qualiﬁcations ) . However , a clear analogical link between the concepts in each pair was not immedi - ately obvious , leaving the door open to a variety of possibilities . To manipulate the novelty of the problem framing , participants were either asked to have their idea serve as a method for evaluating applicants’ intellect ( familiar ) or morality ( new ) . Similar to Experiments 1 – 3 , these stimuli were selected from a pretest of 26 possible concepts and 26 possible problems ( 13 famil - iar and 13 new ) . A separate sample of 30 university students rated the concepts on novelty and the problems on novelty and potential usefulness—i . e . , how useful would it be for the university to evalu - ate applicants on the attribute ? The new concept ( Board Game ) pretested as signiﬁcantly more novel for the admissions domain than both familiar concepts : Interview , t ( 29 ) = 6 . 54 , p < . 00001 , d = 1 . 93 , and Recommendation Letter , t ( 29 ) = 5 . 80 , p < . 00001 , d = 1 . 76 . However , the two familiar concepts did not signiﬁcantly differ in novelty , t ( 29 ) = 0 . 18 , p = . 86 . The new problem pretested as signiﬁcantly more novel for the domain than the familiar prob - lem , t ( 29 ) = 5 . 45 , p < . 00001 , d = 1 . 06 . However , the new and famil - iar problems did not signiﬁcantly differ in potential usefulness , t ( 29 ) = 1 . 42 , p = . 17 , providing an equally high ceiling on usefulness across all conditions . After participants selected one of their nascent ideas to further develop , the rest of the experiment was the same across all condi - tions . First , participants were asked to brainstorm ways to further develop their chosen idea . All participants were encouraged to infuse familiar elements , using similar instructions as Experiment 2 . Below these instructions , the following nine familiar ideas were listed in large font : resume , awards , YouTube , family history , essay , GPA , Facebook , standardized testing , and work sample . All nine were below the median level of novelty among the 26 concepts that were pretested . Once participants spent at least 5 min brain - storming , they could move to the ﬁnal page of the survey , in which they described their ﬁnal idea . Measures Amabile’s ( 1996 ) consensual assessment technique was again used to rate participants’ nascent and ﬁnal ideas . All of the raters were trained in the same fashion as Experiments 1 – 3 . Parallel to the bookstore managers and customers in the previous experi - ments , expert raters were recruited to provide perspectives from both sides of the admissions process—i . e . , admissions ofﬁcers and recent applicants . Speciﬁcally , three admissions ofﬁcers and six current students at the university assessed the ﬁnal ideas on novelty , usefulness , and overall creativity . The three admissions ofﬁcers averaged 6 . 67 years of experience working in university admissions , and 3 . 67 years at this particular university . The six recent applicants were all undergraduates who had been through the admissions process within the previous four years . A separate set of three undergraduates rated all of the nascent ideas generated by participants ( only the selected nascent ideas were rated in Experiments 1 – 3 ) . Across all conditions , the nascent ideas participants selected were not signiﬁcantly different in novelty , usefulness , or creativity from the other nascent ideas they generated . 10 J . M . Berg / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 125 ( 2014 ) 1 – 17 Novelty was deﬁned as : ‘‘The degree to which the idea is unique from other ideas , especially existing methods of evaluating university applicants . How original is the idea ? ’’ Usefulness was deﬁned as : ‘‘The degree of value offered by the idea . How useful is the idea as a method for evaluating applicants in university admissions ? ’’ Creativity was deﬁned as : ‘‘Overall degree to which the idea is both novel and useful . How innovative is the idea in the domain of university admissions ? ’’ The admissions ofﬁcer and student ratings were highly correlated ( r = . 65 for novelty , r = . 69 for usefulness , and r = . 58 for creativity ) , and thus were averaged together to provide a consensual assessment from both of these key stakeholders in the domain ( Amabile , 1996 ) . 2 Final ideas that were rated high in novelty but low in usefulness included having applicants compete in a board game tournament , as well as holding a contest in which applicants try to get as many ‘‘likes’’ on their YouTube videos as possible . Final ideas rated low in novelty but high in usefulness included giving applicants moral dilemmas in interviews , as well as collecting recommendation let - ters from leaders of volunteer activities in which applicants have participated . Final ideas rated high in both novelty and usefulness ( and overall creativity ) included inviting applicants to submit videos in which they present a board game that they design to rep - resent their life and qualiﬁcations , as well as asking interviewees to create an invention using only a prescribed set of materials . Means by condition are in Table 8 . Results Constructive replication of H1 – H4 To address H1 – H4 , the data from the new and familiar primal mark conditions were used—the integrative and familiar - analogy conditions were excluded because they were not relevant to these hypotheses . Because all the conditions received encouragement to infuse familiar elements , H1 and H4 were tested together . In par - ticular , an ANOVA was conducted , crossing the primal mark and problem with ﬁnal novelty as the dependent variable and ﬁnal use - fulness as a control . This revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for the primal mark , F ( 1 , 108 ) = 8 . 10 , p = . 005 , g 2 = . 07 . The main effect for the problem and the two - way interaction between the primal mark and problem were not signiﬁcant . As predicted in H1 and H4 , new primal marks ( M = 4 . 00 , SD = 0 . 94 ) led to ﬁnal ideas that were higher in novelty than familiar primal marks ( M = 3 . 40 , SD = 1 . 00 ) . Because all conditions received encouragement to infuse famil - iar elements after the primal mark , the variance in ﬁnal usefulness between the new and familiar primal mark conditions was likely watered down , undermining tests of H2 . However , the nascent ideas were submitted before the familiarity infusion , thus the rat - ings of nascent usefulness from the new and familiar primal mark conditions were used to address H2 . Speciﬁcally , an ANOVA was conducted , crossing the primal mark and problem with nascent usefulness as the dependent variable and nascent novelty as a control . This revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for the primal mark , F ( 1 , 108 ) = 10 . 28 , p = . 004 , g 2 = . 09 . The main effect for the problem and the two - way interaction were not signiﬁcant . As predicted in H2 , new primal marks ( M = 2 . 76 , SD = 1 . 23 ) led to nascent ideas that were lower in usefulness than familiar primal marks ( M = 3 . 43 , SD = 1 . 06 ) . 3 To address H3 , the temporal changes in usefulness for new and familiar primal marks were calculated using paired - samples t - tests . Since all conditions received encouragement to infuse familiar elements , the change from nascent to ﬁnal usefulness is likely to reﬂect the impact of infusing familiar elements . As expected , ideas from new primal marks signiﬁcantly increased in usefulness from nascent ( M = 2 . 76 , SD = 1 . 23 ) to ﬁnal ( M = 3 . 14 , SD = 0 . 94 ) , t ( 54 ) = 2 . 22 , p = . 03 , d = 0 . 35 . In contrast , the usefulness of ideas from familiar primal marks did not signiﬁcantly change from nascent ( M = 3 . 43 , SD = 1 . 06 ) to ﬁnal ( M = 3 . 42 , SD = 0 . 83 ) , t ( 57 ) = # 0 . 05 p = . 96 . In sum , these results provide additional support for H1 – H4 . Results for H5 and H6 All conditions were included in the analyses for H5 and H6 . To test H5a ( integrative primal marks yield more novel ideas than familiar primal marks ) , an ANOVA was used , crossing the primal mark and problem with ﬁnal novelty as the dependent variable and ﬁnal usefulness as a control ( see Table 9 ) . This revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for the primal mark , F ( 3 , 217 ) = 12 . 15 , p < . 00001 , g 2 = . 14 . The main effect for the problem and the two - way interaction between the primal mark and problem were not signiﬁcant . As predicted , ideas from inte - grative primal marks ( M = 4 . 20 , SD = 0 . 77 ) were signiﬁcantly more novel than ideas from familiar primal marks ( M = 3 . 40 , SD = 1 . 00 ) , t ( 113 ) = 3 . 47 , p < . 00001 , d = 0 . 90 , as well as familiar - analogy primal marks ( M = 3 . 49 , SD = 0 . 86 ) , t ( 111 ) = 4 . 58 , p = . 00001 , d = 0 . 87 . Tukey HSD tests comparing the two integra - tive primal mark conditions to each of the four familiar / familiar - analogy primal mark conditions in ﬁnal novelty were all signiﬁcant in the predicted direction ( see Table 8 ) . These results support H5a . To test H5b ( integrative primal marks yield more useful ideas than new primal marks ) , the same ANOVA was used , but with ﬁnal usefulness as the dependent variable and ﬁnal novelty as a control ( see Table 9 ) . This revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for the primal mark , F ( 3 , 217 ) = 5 . 56 , p = . 001 , g 2 = . 07 . As predicted in H5b , ideas from integrative primal marks ( M = 3 . 65 , SD = 0 . 80 ) were signiﬁ - cantly more useful than ideas from new primal marks ( M = 3 . 14 , SD = 0 . 94 ) , t ( 110 ) = 3 . 14 , p = . 002 , d = 0 . 58 . To test H6 ( integrative primal marks yield more creative ideas than familiar and new primal marks ) , an ANOVA was used , cross - ing the primal mark and problem with overall creativity as the dependent variable ( see Table 9 ) . This revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for the primal mark , F ( 3 , 218 ) = 12 . 67 , p < . 00001 , g 2 = . 15 . Planned t - tests showed that as predicted in H6a and H6b respec - tively , ideas from integrative primal marks ( M = 3 . 72 , SD = 0 . 73 ) were signiﬁcantly higher in overall creativity than ideas from familiar primal marks ( M = 3 . 16 , SD = 0 . 68 ) , t ( 113 ) = 4 . 30 , p = . 00004 , d = 0 . 79 , and new primal marks ( M = 3 . 09 , SD = 0 . 63 ) , t ( 110 ) = 4 . 90 , p < . 00001 , d = 0 . 92 . Tukey HSD tests comparing the two integrative primal mark conditions to each of the other six conditions were all signiﬁcant in the predicted direction , except for the new primal mark , familiar problem condition—though a simple t - test was signiﬁcant ( see Table 8 ) . In sum , these results support H5 and H6 . Supplementary data : Frequency of familiar , new , and integrative primal marks Results across Experiments 1 – 4 suggest that integrative primal marks are most conducive to producing creative ideas . However , due to the cognitive complexity required to set and build on integrative primal marks , employees may not be inclined to use them ( Kruglanski & Webster , 1996 ) . To test the extent to which 2 When analyzed separately , the pattern of results was the same for both the admissions ofﬁcer and student ratings . 3 The results were similar when considering the average novelty and usefulness of all the nascent ideas generated by each participant ( as opposed to just the selected nascent ideas ) : on average , new primal marks led to nascent ideas that were signiﬁcantly more novel , t ( 111 ) = 2 . 69 , p = . 008 , d = 0 . 49 , and less useful , t ( 111 ) = # 4 . 09 , p = . 00008 , d = # 1 . 31 , than familiar primal marks .

This may be due to raters weighing novelty and usefulness fairly equally in their assessments of overall creativity in Experiment 4 , whereas raters in Experiments 1 – 3 weighed novelty more heavily than usefulness in their assessments of overall creativity ( see correlations in Table 1 ) . b Simple t - test was signiﬁcant , t ( 85 ) = 2 . 73 , p = . 008 . 12 J .

Participants were given seven different creativity tasks , including three parallel to the manipulations from the experiments , and four from a variety of other domains . In each task , participants were shown both a familiar idea and a new idea and asked to choose ele - ments from one or both to serve as a starting point for a creative idea , which they would further develop on the next page of the survey . The order of the two choices was randomized , and no order effects were found . The tasks included developing an idea for a novel and useful : kitchen utensil , website , piece of exercise equip - ment , and way to improve customers’ experience in grocery stores ( Table 10 outlines the options and results for each task ) . For each task , as in Experiments 1 – 4 , participants were randomly assigned to either a relatively new or familiar framing of the creative prob - lem . Across all seven tasks , participants chose integrative primal marks only 15 . 61 % of the time ( tasks ranged from 7 . 41 % to 25 . 00 % ) . For all tasks , the majority of participants selected a famil - iar primal mark , except for the admissions task , in which the majority selected a new primal mark—perhaps because the new idea ( board game ) could be analogically linked to evaluating applicants with relative ease . The novelty of the problem did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the results for any of the tasks . These sup - plementary data—combined with the experiment results—suggest that although setting integrative primal marks may offer the best chance for developing creative ideas , employees may be unlikely to do so , preferring instead to start with more familiar or less complex primal marks . General discussion Across four experiments , results suggest that on average , famil - iar primal marks yield more useful but less novel ideas , while new primal marks yield more novel but less useful ideas . Integrative primal marks , however , have the best chance of yielding novel and useful ideas . Despite the potential beneﬁts of integrative primal marks , supplementary results suggest that employees are more inclined to set familiar and new primal marks than integra - tive primal marks . These results offer key contributions to theory and research on creativity in organizations .

Berg / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 125 ( 2014 ) 1 – 17 13 ical tasks ( e . g . , Northcraft & Neale , 1987 ; Tversky & Kahneman , 1974 ) , they also get anchored by the ﬁrst bit of content in their primal marks as they set out to develop creative ideas . As afore - mentioned , previous theory and research has highlighted the importance of the beginning of creative tasks , but these past perspectives have tended to focus on framing effects in the task identiﬁcation stage ( e . g . , Csikszentmihalyi & Getzels , 1971 ; Mumford et al . , 1997 ) . The primal mark concept complements these perspectives by showing that important anchoring effects are also established slightly later in the creative process , at the point when employees commit to developing an initial bit of con - tent into an emerging idea . Across all four experiments , the primal mark anchored the trajectory of novelty and usefulness in both familiar and new problems , suggesting that the primal mark may cause anchoring effects that operate over and above framing effects established earlier in the creative task . In addition , results from Experiment 1 suggest that the primal mark and the problem framing may interact in important ways , as the anchoring effects of new primal marks on novelty and usefulness were stronger for the new problem than the familiar problem ( though new primal marks still had signiﬁcant anchoring effects for the familiar problem ) . However , this interaction was not signiﬁcant in Experiments 2 – 4 , perhaps because both the primal mark and problem manipulations were strongest in Experiment 1 . In general , results across the four experiments demonstrate the theoretical value of considering the actual content that employees use to construct ideas , and the psychological implications of using different types of content . Furthermore , models of the creative process typically posit that emerging ideas become creative ideas through many iterative cycles of elaboration , incubation , and evaluation ( Amabile , 1996 ; Lubart , 2001 ) . An implicit assumption underlying these models is that emerging ideas can become more creative as they are elabo - rated and reﬁned with additional content . However , the primal mark concept and the results on its anchoring effects complicate this notion . While emerging ideas may increase in usefulness as they are elaborated , the novelty of emerging ideas is likely anchored by the primal mark and thus unlikely to increase much as ideas are developed with additional content . As such , when employees set familiar primal marks , they limit the novelty of any ideas they are likely to produce . Similarly , if employees set new primal marks rather than integrative primal marks , they may constrain the extent to which they are able to boost the use - fulness of their emerging ideas . Therefore , compared to integrative primal marks , setting either familiar or new primal marks may place a ceiling on the creativity of ideas from the very beginning of their development . Taken together , these results on the anchor - ing effects of primal marks suggest that the content used earlier in the development of ideas exerts greater inﬂuence on ﬁnal creativ - ity than content incorporated later in the creative process . In other words , once the primal mark is set , the fate of any ideas that grow from it may be largely sealed . Dynamics between novelty and usefulness Second , this paper sheds light on key dynamics between the two dimensions of creativity—novelty and usefulness—throughout the creative process . Past creativity research has tended to focus on novelty alone ( e . g . , Ward , 1994 ) , or lumped novelty and usefulness together in one overall creativity construct ( e . g . , Oldham & Cummings , 1996 ) . Some research has treated novelty and useful - ness as independent dimensions of creativity , suggesting that nov - elty and usefulness are driven by different psychological processes ( e . g . , Amabile , Barsade , Mueller , & Staw , 2005 ; Grant & Berry , 2011 ) . Furthermore , scholars have recognized that it may be rare for ideas to be seen as high in both novelty and usefulness ( e . g . , Fleming , 2001 ; Mueller et al . , 2012 ; Rietzschel et al . , 2010 ) . How - ever , all of this past research has focused on the novelty and / or usefulness of ﬁnalized ideas at the end of the creative process , overlooking the possible dynamics between novelty and usefulness throughout the creative process . This paper addresses the dynam - ics between novelty and usefulness by examining how each dimension changes ( or not ) from the beginning to the end of creative tasks . Results across the experiments suggest that novelty and useful - ness may diverge early in creative tasks . In particular , familiar primal marks may drive usefulness up and novelty down , and new and integrative primal marks may drive novelty up and use - fulness down ( at least in the short run ) . However , while ideas from familiar primal marks are likely to stay high in usefulness but low in novelty , ideas from new and integrative primal marks may increase in usefulness as familiar elements are infused , helping usefulness catch up with novelty ( especially for integrative primal marks ) . Taken together , these results suggest that usefulness is more ﬂexible than novelty , as novelty is more rigidly anchored by the primal mark than usefulness . Thus , favoring usefulness over novelty early in creative tasks may lead to a permanent tradeoff between the two , as novelty will be sacriﬁced for usefulness in the end . In contrast , favoring novelty over usefulness early in cre - ative tasks may lead to a temporary tradeoff between the two , but allow for the tradeoff to be overcome in the end . In other words , familiar primal marks may create a more zero - sum relationship between novelty and usefulness , while new and integrative primal marks may avoid a zero - sum relationship between the two . This suggests that in both theory and practice , the relative importance that should be placed on novelty and usefulness may depend on how far along ideas are in their development . Early in creative tasks , novelty may be more important than usefulness , and vice versa later in creative tasks . In general , this research suggests that rather than viewing novelty and usefulness as independent dimen - sions of creative output , scholars may beneﬁt from considering the dynamics between the two dimensions over time . Familiar and new knowledge in creativity Lastly , this research helps elucidate the role of familiar ( vs . new ) knowledge in creativity . Familiar knowledge has been construed as both an essential enabler and a harmful constraint for creativity . On one hand , scholars have argued that familiar knowledge is a critical precursor to creative ideas , as employees need to know the existing body of familiar ideas in the domain in order to know how to build on them in novel and useful ways ( Amabile , 1996 , Ford , 1996 ; Simonton , 1997 ) . On the other hand , research on design ﬁxation ( Ward et al . , 1999 ) and inadvertent plagiarism / conformity ( e . g . , Kohn & Smith , 2011 ; Marsh et al . , 1999 ) suggests that familiar knowledge often constrains creativity because indi - viduals’ thinking tends to get trapped within familiar schemas . This paper helps integrate these opposing perspectives by suggest - ing that familiar knowledge may enable or constrain creativity depending on when and how it is used in the creative process . Results across the experiments suggest that starting with a familiar primal mark is all it takes to trap employees’ thinking within famil - iar schemas . However , the results also suggest that familiar ideas provide key ingredients in the development of creative ideas , but only when they are combined with new elements to create integra - tive primal marks or incorporated after the primal mark is set . Thus , together these results suggest that familiar knowledge may be a blessing or a curse for creativity , depending on whether it is used at the right time or not . More broadly , while past research 14 J . M . Berg / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 125 ( 2014 ) 1 – 17 has focused on what types of knowledge are recombined and by whom ( e . g . , Burt , 2004 ; Hargadon , 2002 ; Perry - Smith , 2014 ) , this research highlights the importance of when types of knowledge are used in the creative process . Limitations and future directions These experiments have key limitations that may be addressed in future research . First , although the creative tasks were deﬁned in a relatively open - ended way , the experiments set the parameters of the primal mark for participants and only required the genera - tion of three nascent ideas . This may not parallel the usual experi - ence of creative tasks in organizations , which tend to be longer term and more iterative in nature . Future research could test the external validity of these results using ﬁeld experiments in which participants are allowed to generate their own primal marks and creative tasks over longer periods of time . Second , these experi - ments leave unanswered questions about the impact of the content included in the primal mark and the elements used to elaborate it . Future research could further examine the role of content by manipulating the usefulness , relevance , or amount of content in the primal mark and the elements used to elaborate it . Third , these experiments did not address key individual differences , such as creative self - efﬁcacy ( Tierney & Farmer , 2011 ) , that may moderate the effects of the primal mark . Future survey research could exam - ine the impact of individual differences . Fourth , the experiments deﬁned the creative problem before the primal mark and then familiar or novel elements were infused shortly thereafter . How - ever , there may be different implications if the primal mark comes before the problem is deﬁned or if the familiar or novel elements are infused later in the creative process . Also , across the experi - ments , the primal mark appeared to be a more powerful driver of novelty and usefulness than the problem , but this may have been due to the primal mark manipulation being stronger than the problem manipulation . Future experiments could manipulate the order , timing , and strength of the primal mark , problem , and infusion manipulations to test for temporal and magnitude effects . Practical implications and conclusion The speed and need for creativity is on the rise in many organi - zations . This research offers guidance for employees and managers who wish to develop novel , useful , or creative ideas in organiza - tions . For individuals seeking the quickest path to usefulness with little concern for novelty , familiar primal marks may yield the practical ideas they desire . Conversely , those who value novelty over usefulness may be well served by new primal marks . However , when more radical creativity is desired ( Madjar , Greenberg , & Chen , 2011 ) , a more optimal balance of novelty and usefulness may be required , and thus integrative primal marks may plant the best seeds for creativity . Despite the beneﬁts of integrative primal marks , the supplementary results suggest that integrative primal marks may be relatively rare , as participants were signiﬁcantly more inclined to set familiar and new primal marks . This hints that on average , the majority of ideas in organizations may be doomed from the very beginning of their development , as they are not able to reap the beneﬁts of integra - tive primal marks . Thus , employees and managers who desire creative ideas may want to take active steps to facilitate the use of integrative primal marks . For instance , employees could purposefully explore other domains in which they are likely to ﬁnd ideas that can be analog - ically linked to the creative task at hand ( Hargadon , 2002 ) , and make sure that any ideas they generate include a mix of new content from these outside domains and familiar content from their focal domain . Perhaps equally as important , employees may beneﬁt from recognizing when they have been anchored by famil - iar primal marks—rather than struggle to make their emerging ideas more novel , employees may be better off starting over with an integrative primal mark . In addition , managers could group employees who have knowledge from outside the focal domain with employees who have knowledge within the domain to work on creative tasks together . However , given the challenges involved in group brainstorming ( Diehl & Stroebe , 1987 ; Mullen , Johnson , & Salas , 1991 ) , groups may converge too quickly on relatively useful ideas from familiar primal marks . Thus , managers may beneﬁt from establishing the norm that all ideas must be constructed with a mix of new and familiar content . Once the primal mark is set , employees with more familiar knowledge in the focal domain could take the lead in elaborating the idea with familiar elements . Furthermore , when evaluating and giving feedback on nascent ideas early in creative tasks , by default managers may value useful - ness over novelty ( Mueller et al . , 2012 ) . This may lead managers to reject nascent ideas from integrative ( or new ) primal marks prematurely , without giving them the opportunity to increase in usefulness . Rather than rejecting these novel ideas early in creative tasks , managers may actually beneﬁt from rejecting nascent ideas that include too much familiar content . This way , employees can go back and reset primal marks with more new content , escaping the anchoring effects of familiar primal marks . In general , the results across these experiments suggest that employees and managers ought to pay careful attention to the pri - mal marks they or others set .
