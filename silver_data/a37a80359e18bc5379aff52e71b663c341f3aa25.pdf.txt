Household surveys provide a unique 5 opportunity to better understand SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and the role of individual 6 characteristics . 7 Here , we assessed the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 acquisition from household and community 8 exposure according to age , family ties , and socioeconomic and living conditions using data 9 from the nationwide population - based EpiCov cohort / ORCHESTRA collaboration in 10 November - December 2020 . 11 12 Methods 13 A history of SARS - CoV - 2 infection was defined by a positive Euroimmun Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 14 ELISA IgG result in November - December 2020 . We applied stochastic chain binomial models 15 fitted to the final distribution of infections in households to data from 17 , 983 individuals ≥5 16 years enrolled from 8 , 165 households . Models estimated the competing risks of being 17 infected from community and household exposure . 18 19 Results 20 Young adults aged 18 - 24 years had the highest risk of extra - household infection ( 8 . 9 % , [ 95 % 21 credible interval , Crl ] : 7 . 5 – 10 . 4 ) , whereas the oldest ( > 75 ) and the youngest ( 6 - 10 ) had the 22 lowest risk , 2 . 6 % ( 1 . 8 – 3 . 5 ) and 3 . 4 % ( 1 . 9 – 5 . 2 ) , respectively . Extra - household infection was 23 also independently associated with socioeconomic conditions . Within households , the 24 probability of person - to - person transmission increased with age : 10 . 6 % ( 5 . 0 – 17 . 9 ) among 25 6 - 10 - year - olds to 43 . 1 % ( 32 . 6 – 53 . 2 ) among 65 - 74 - year - olds . It was higher between 26 partners 29 . 9 % ( 25 . 6 - 34 . 3 ) and from mother to child 29 . 1 % ( 21 . 4 – 37 . 3 ) than between 27 individuals related by other family ties . 28 29 Conclusion 30 All rights reserved .

Intra - household infection mainly depended on age and family 32 ties . 33 34 35 Key Messages 36 • Young adults aged 18 - 24 years had the highest probability of extra - household SARS - Cov - 37 2 acquisition over the year 2020 : 8 . 9 % , 95 % credible interval ( 95 % Crl ) 7 . 5 – 10 . 4 . 38 • The probability of extra - household infection increased with family income and 39 population density in the municipality of residence and was higher in the French regions 40 most affected by the waves of SARS - CoV - 2 . 41 • When estimating the probability of person - to - person transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , the 42 65 - 74 year - olds had the highest susceptibility , i . e . the highest probability of SARS - CoV - 2 43 acquisition when exposed to an infected household member ( 22 . 1 % , 16 . 4 – 28 . 2 ) 44 • The probability of transmission was the highest between partners ( 29 . 9 % , 25 . 6 – 34 . 3 ) . 45 The probability of transmission was higher from mother to child than from father to 46 child : 29 . 1 % , ( 21 . 4 – 37 . 3 ) and 14 . 0 % ( 5 . 9 – 22 . 8 ) , respectively .

Regarding COVID - 19 , 52 household studies have provided accumulating evidence that susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 53 infection is lower for children ( < 8 - 10 years of age ) , relative to adults , and higher among 54 those > 60 - 65 years relative to younger / middle - aged adults 1 , 2 . However , evidence is still 55 lacking regarding risk for newborns , young children , and adolescents , while these age groups 56 are characterized by highly heterogeneous behavior and social contact patterns . 57 Based on a population - based serosurvey in Geneva , Switzerland over April - June 2020 , Bi et 58 al . identified a reduced risk of within - household infection among young children ( 5 - 8 years 59 of age ) and young people ( 10 - 19 ) relative to middle - aged adults ( 20 - 49 ) 3 . This study was 60 however carried out a time of particularly low prevalence among children across Europe 4 – 8 61 after a long period of school closure during which children had limited interactions outside 62 of the home . limiting the possibility of studying routes of infection and infectivity among 63 children . From June - December 2020 , data from a Canadian pediatric cohort highlighted 64 higher infectivity among children than adolescents 9 . Importantly despite growing evidence 65 of social disparities in the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection 10 – 14 socio - economic factors were 66 rarely evaluated at the household level . 67 The EpiCov cohort is a rich nationwide population - based serosurvey in France , with a 68 household survey performed in November - December 2020 , when schools were open and 69 vaccination had not yet been implemented . Serological assays are used to measure antibody 70 responses in blood samples as the sign of a previous SARS - Cov - 2 infection , while virological 71 tests detect ongoing infection . While these later may miss mild or asymptomatic infections 72 15 , serological tests remain sensitive over a longer period 16 and thus consist in 73 All rights reserved .

Here , 74 we used mathematical modelling to assess , from the Epicov data , the effects of age , family 75 ties , and living and socio - economic conditions on the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 acquisition from 76 both household and community exposure . 77 78 79 METHODS 80 The EpiCov cohort 81 EpiCov is a national random population - based cohort that combines serological testing and 82 longitudinal follow - up . It aims to analyze both the impact of living conditions on the 83 dynamics of the epidemic and the impact of the epidemic on health and living conditions in 84 France . In May 2020 , 371 , 000 individuals aged ≥15 years living in mainland France or three 85 of the five French overseas territories were randomly selected from the Fidéli administrative 86 sampling frame . This database is considered to be quasi - exhaustive for the population living 87 in France 17 . The survey design was defined to ensure overrepresentation of the less densely 88 populated departments and lower income households , for which lower response rates were 89 expected . Selected individuals were contacted to undergo a web / telephone questionnaire . 90 The survey design , multimodal data collection have been detailed elsewhere 11 . 91 92 Household study design 93 In November 2020 , a 20 % subsample of EpiCov participants was randomly drawn to be part 94 of a household study . Eligible participants were offered home capillary blood self - sampling 95 for SARS - CoV - 2 serology for all household members , i . e . , any person living at the same 96 address aged > 6 years .

He / she was defined 98 as the respondent member . Households for whom the respondent was aged < 17 years or 99 living in a household of > 9 members were not proposed to participate in the household sub - 100 study . 101 102 Epidemiological context of the household survey 103 This household survey aimed to capture infections that had occurred from the start of the 104 pandemic in France ( February - March 2020 ) to November - December 2020 . This period 105 covers the first two waves of the COVID - 19 pandemic , mostly caused by the wildtype virus 106 before the alpha variant gradually became dominant after its introduction at the end of 2020 107 18 and before the start of the vaccination campaign on December 27 , 2020 19 . The 108 epidemiological evolution during the year 2020 in France has been described elsewhere 12 109 and is briefly detailed in Supplementary Note 1 . 110 111 Laboratory analyses 112 Dried - blood spots were collected on 903Whatman paper ( DBS ) kits sent to each participant 113 who agreed to blood sampling and mailed to one of the three participating biobanks 114 ( Bordeaux , Amiens , Montpellier ) to be punched using a PantheraTM machine ( Perkin Elmer ) . 115 Eluates were processed in the virology laboratory ( Unité des Virus Emergents , Marseille ) 116 with a commercial ELISA kit ( Euroimmun® , Lübeck , Germany ) for the detection of anti - SARS - 117 CoV - 2 antibodies ( IgG ) against the S1 domain of the viral spike protein ( ELISA - S ) , according 118 to the manufacturer’s instructions . 119 120 Outcome 121 All rights reserved .

We also considered the 127 administrative region , the population density in the municipality of residence , whether the 128 housing was overcrowded , defined as housing with < 18 m 2 per inhabitant , and whether the 129 neighborhood was defined as socially deprived according to national definitions for 130 prioritizing targeted socio - economic interventions . 131 132 Ethics 133 The survey was approved by the CNIL ( the French data protection authority ) 134 ( MLD / MFI / AR205138 ) and the local ethics committee ( Comité de Protection des Personnes 135 Sud Mediteranée III 2020 - A01191 - 38 ) . The survey was also reviewed by the “Comité du 136 Label de la Statistique Publique” . The serological results were sent to the participants by 137 post with information on how to interpret the individual test results . 138 139 Statistical analysis 140 We analyzed all households for which serostatus was available for all members . Because 141 serostatus of young children was not available in EpiCov , households with children ≤5 years 142 of age were removed . We applied stochastic chain binomial transmission models to the final 143 distribution of infections in households 3 , 20 .

We estimated : 146 1 ) the probability that a susceptible individual i was infected from extra - household exposure 147 since the beginning of the pandemic to the time of the serosurvey and 2 ) the probability that 148 a susceptible individual i was infected from a single infectious household member j ; note this 149 was not the overall probability of being infected within the household but a probability of 150 person - to - person transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . For the purposes of simplicity , we considered 151 the serological status to be a perfect marker of having been infected and neglected the 152 occurrence of false positives or false negatives . We also neglected the possibility that 153 individuals could have been infected several times . 154 We investigated factors associated with the risk of extra - and within - household SARS - Cov - 2 155 acquisition . They included the characteristics of the susceptible individual (cid:0) and the potential 156 infector (cid:2) , as well as the living and socioeconomic conditions of the household ( see 157 Supplementary Note 2 ) . The variables considered for modeling the probability of extra - 158 household acquisition were : age and gender of the susceptible member , family income , 159 population density in the municipality of residence , and living in a socially deprived 160 neighborhood . We also considered immigration status , this variable being collected for the 161 respondent . We accounted for spatial heterogeneity in the extra - household probability , 162 adjusting for the administrative region . For the probability that an infectious household 163 member j infects a susceptible household member i , we considered the following covariates : 164 age and gender of the susceptible individual i , age and gender of the potential infector j , 165 family ties between i and j ( i . e . , whether j was i ’s partner , parent , child , sibling , grandparent , 166 grandchild , or other ) , household size , accommodation type , and number of rooms . We also 167 tested whether demographic and socioeconomic factors ( immigration status , family income , 168 population density in the municipality of residence , and living in a socially deprived 169 All rights reserved .

Model 172 parameters were estimated by Bayesian inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) 173 sampling . Model fits were compared using the widely applicable information criterion 174 ( WAIC ) 21 . Given the very low percentage of missing data for the considered variables ( < 4 % ) , 175 we run complete case analysis . 176 We adapted the code written by Bi et al . 3 and available in open access to the EPICOV data . 177 Models were implemented in the Stan probabilistic programming language using the rstan R 178 package ( version 2 . 21 . 2 ) . We used weakly informative priors on all parameters to be 179 normally distributed on the logit scale , with a mean of 0 and a standard error of 1 . 5 . We ran 180 four chains of 1 , 500 iterations each with 500 warm - up iterations . We assessed convergence 181 visually and using the Gelman - Rubin Convergence Statistic ( R - hat ) . We report estimates as 182 the medians of the posterior samples with their 95 % credible interval ( Crl ) , i . e . , the 2 . 5th and 183 97 . 5th percentiles of their distribution . 184 185 186 RESULTS 187 Study population 188 Among the 22 , 118 households in mainland France drawn from the EpiCov cohort to be part 189 of the household sub - study in November 2020 , we analyzed 17 , 983 individuals belonging to 190 8 , 165 households for which the serostatus of all members was available ( Figure 1 ) . The 191 median date of blood sampling was November 27 th , 2020 ( interquartile range , IQR : 23th 192 November – 6th December ) . The median age of the participants was 52 years ( IQR , 28 – 64 ) , 193 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

The household characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Most of 194 the households were one - person ( 25 . 9 % ) or two - person ( 47 . 4 % ) , which differed from the 195 general population ( 36 . 9 % and 32 . 6 % one and two - person households in 2019 , respectively 196 22 ) . The main family structures were couples without ( 43 . 2 % ) and with children ( 23 . 8 % ) . 197 Young people ( 6 - 24 years ) and middle - aged adults ( 35 - 54 ) mainly lived in households with > 2 198 members , whereas 25 - 34 and > 55 - year - olds mainly lived in two - person households ( Table 199 S1 ) . The proportion of one - person households was the highest among 25 - 34 - year - olds 200 ( 21 . 1 % ) and > 75 - year - olds ( 21 . 0 % ) . 201 202 Seroprevalence and household final attack rates 203 At the individual level , overall seroprevalence did not differ by gender but varied with age , 204 increasing from 5 . 5 % among 6 - 10 - year - olds to 7 . 5 % among 11 - 14 - year - olds and 7 . 7 % among 205 15 - 17 - year - olds , before peaking at 10 . 7 % among 18 - 24 - year - olds and then decreasing to 206 3 . 0 % among those aged ≥75 ( Figure 2A , B ) . 207 The proportion of households with at least one seropositive member was 9 . 6 % overall and 208 increased from 5 . 1 % for one - person households to 23 . 1 % for households with ≥5 members 209 ( Figure 2C , Table S2 ) . Most infected households counted only one or two positive individuals , 210 even in households > 3 members ( Figure 2D ) . Among households with at least one positive 211 individual , the proportion of positive members was 52 % overall and decreased with 212 household size , from 66 % in two - person households to 47 % in three - person households , to 213 40 % in 4 and > 4 - person households . 214 215 Factors associated with the acquisition of SARS - CoV - 2 216 All rights reserved .

This probability varied with age : young adults aged 18 - 24 years had 219 the highest probability of extra - household infection and those aged ≥75 had the lowest 220 ( Figure 3A ) . 221 The estimated median probability of person - to - person transmission between household 222 members was 17 . 9 % ( 16 . 0 – 19 . 9 ) overall . It varied with age of the susceptible : susceptibility 223 was the highest among 65 - 74 - year - olds , and the lowest among 6 - 10 - year - old ( Figure 3B ) . 224 Models allowing for differential risk of transmission by the age of the infector showed the 225 lowest infectivity for the 15 - 17 and 18 - 24 age groups ( Figure 3C ) . The probability of person - 226 to - person transmission between household members was 29 . 5 % ( 24 . 3 – 34 . 9 ) in two - person 227 households , and decreased to 15 % in larger households . These overall estimates concealed 228 heterogeneous probabilities of transmission according to family ties . The probability of 229 transmission was the highest between partners ( 29 . 9 % , 25 . 6 – 34 . 3 ) , which was consistent 230 with the estimate in two - person households ( Figure 4A , B ) . The probability of transmission 231 was higher from mother to child ( 29 . 1 % , 21 . 4 – 37 . 3 ) than from father to child ( 14 . 0 % , 5 . 9 – 232 22 . 8 ) . From child to parent it was of 11 . 8 % ( 2 . 5 – 25 . 1 ) for children < 12 years of age and 233 decreased to 4 . 1 % ( 0 . 9 – 9 . 0 ) for children ≥12 years of age . The limited number of three - 234 generation families in the sample led to wide credible intervals when estimating the 235 transmission risk between grandchildren and grandparents . Family income , population 236 density in the municipality of residence , immigration status , and region were not associated 237 with the risk of person - to - person transmission between household members ( Table S3 ) . 238 In multivariate analysis , the probability of being infected from extra - household exposure was 239 adjusted for the age of the susceptible individual , family income , population density in the 240 All rights reserved .

The association with age remained similar : young people ( 18 - 24 - year - 242 olds ) and middle - aged adults ( 25 - 34 and 35 - 44 - year - olds ) had a higher risk of extra - 243 household SARS - CoV - 2 acquisition than that of 55 - 64 - year - olds ( Table 2 ) . The probability of 244 extra - household infection increased with family income ( highest for the two highest deciles 245 compared to the central deciles ) and population density in the municipality of residence . 246 Individuals in households in which the respondent participant was a first - or second - 247 generation immigrant from outside Europe had a higher risk of extra - household SARS - CoV - 2 248 acquisition in univariate analysis . This effect was tempered after adjusting for socioeconomic 249 factors . Finally , as expected , the regions with the highest SARS - CoV - 2 incidence at the time 250 of the survey were those with the highest probability of extra - household infection . 251 Concerning intra - household transmission , the probability of person - to - person transmission 252 was adjusted for the age of the susceptible and his / her family link with the potential 253 infector . Those aged 65 - 74 years had twice the odds of being infected from a single infected 254 household member than 55 - 64 - year - olds ( aOR 1 . 9 , 95 % CrI 1 . 0 – 3 . 5 ) , whereas 6 - 10 - year - olds 255 appeared to have a lower risk of infection ( aOR 0 . 4 , 0 . 1 – 1 . 2 ) , but the 95 % credible interval 256 was wide . The risk of transmission from mother to child was similar to that between 257 partners aOR , 1 . 2 ( 0 . 5 – 2 . 8 ) , whereas it was lower from father to child than from mother to 258 child ( aOR 0 . 34 , 0 . 06 – 1 . 04 ) . The risk of transmission from child to parent decreased with 259 increasing age of the child : aOR , 0 . 63 ( 95 % CrI , 0 . 07 – 2 . 16 ) for children < 12 years and 0 . 27 260 ( 0 . 09 – 0 . 57 ) for children ≥12 years , using transmission between partners as the reference . 261 When adjusting for family ties , household size was no longer associated with the risk of 262 person - to - person transmission . 263 All rights reserved .

The introduction of these two variables into the multivariate analysis did not 266 change the odds ratio estimates for age or family ties . 267 268 Proportion of intra - household infections 269 Using the posterior distribution of parameters from the final multivariate model , we 270 simulated the predicted sources of infection for all individuals in the study ( see 271 Supplementary Note 1 ) . We estimated that 25 . 5 % ( 95 % CrI , 25 . 1 – 25 . 8 ) of all infections were 272 caused by another household member . This proportion increased with household size , from 273 22 . 2 % ( 21 . 6 – 22 . 7 ) for two - person households to 44 . 0 % ( 42 . 5 – 45 . 5 ) for households with ≥5 274 members ( Figure 5 ) . 275 276 277 DISCUSSION 278 Using serological data from the French nationwide population - based EpiCov cohort , we 279 estimated the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 acquisition from the community and the person - to - person 280 transmission risk within households in 2020 . Participants of all ages > 5 years were included 281 and we particularly investigated the effect of family composition , socioeconomic factors , and 282 living conditions on within - household SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Based on simulations , we 283 found that household transmission represented one quarter of SARS - CoV - 2 infections .

Young adults had the highest probability of extra - household 290 infection , probably reflecting a higher intensity of social interaction in this age group . The 291 highest probability of being infected when exposed to an infectious individual at home was 292 obtained for the 65 - 74 year - olds , which may be explained by either a higher susceptibility to 293 virus infection or by more time spent at home relative to the younger age groups . 294 Surprisingly , participants > 74 did not have a particularly high risk of being infected by an 295 infectious family member at home . This may reflect a potentially higher level of preventive 296 measures in these populations . A higher level of waning antibodies in the oldest individuals 297 may have also led to an underestimation of the infection rates in this age group 24 . 298 Importantly , individuals leaving in nursing homes were not included in the EpiCov study . 299 Age - specific probabilities of person - to - person transmission result from a combination of 300 biological effects ( immune response and viral shedding ) and behavioral factors ( differences 301 in social exposure and the frequency and intensity of contacts between age groups in the 302 population ) . In models accounting for family ties , the probability of within - household 303 transmission was the highest between partners and from mother to child . Lower values 304 were obtained from child to parents . This is consistent with the higher secondary infection 305 rates for spouses than for other adult relationships , which were reported previously 25 , 26 . We 306 found a higher probability of transmission to parents from the < 12 year - old children than 307 from older children , probably reflecting heterogeneity in contact patterns between 308 individuals within families . Overall , our results suggest that , in a context where schools were 309 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Surprisingly , we did not find an association between 315 within - household person - to - person transmission and overcrowded housing or 316 accommodation type , by opposition to some previous studies which reported associations 317 between housing surface areas and secondary infection rates in households 27 , 28 . This 318 difference may be due to the fact that relatively few dwellings were overcrowded in our 319 sample . Isolation measures taken in households after a member became infected may also 320 explain our results but this information was not available . 321 The probability of person - to - person transmission was inversely related to household size . It 322 was 30 % in two - person households , which corresponds to the estimated probability of 323 transmission between partners . It decreased to 15 - 16 % in larger households , which is an 324 average of all the probabilities of transmission between household members that ranged 325 from 4 to 30 % according to families ties . When adjusting for family ties , household size was 326 no longer associated with the risk of person - to - person transmission . 327 Interestingly , from our simulations we estimated that household transmission represented 328 one quarter of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in 2020 . This value depended on the person - to - person 329 probability of transmission within households , as well as the structure of the population : the 330 larger the household size and the number of positive household members , the more likely 331 sequences involving one or more within - household infection events . In France , near 50 % of 332 households are two - persons . Our study population mainly consisted of one - and two - person 333 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

The contribution of household transmission would be expected to be far 334 higher in settings were larger households are more frequent , as the estimated risk of 335 household transmission increased from 22 . 2 % in two - person households to 44 . 0 % in 336 households with ≥5 members . 337 338 Among the main strengths of our study , in addition to its nationwide dimension , is that it 339 covers a period of interest when schools were no longer closed in France , starting from 340 autumn 2020 , and children and young people were therefore more exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 341 in the community . In addition , we accounted for competing risks between extra - and intra - 342 household exposure for SARS - CoV - 2 acquisition and the possibility of tertiary or longer 343 transmission chains within households by using chain binomial models . 344 Some limitations need to be mentioned . First , despite the size of our study , one of the 345 largest in Europe , its statistical power was limited for the analysis of specific interactions , 346 e . g . between grandparents and grandchildren . Second , antibody responses are generally 347 sustained over the first four months following infection but may wane afterwards . The study 348 taking place in fall 2020 , some infections that occurred early in the first wave of the 349 pandemic may have been missed 24 . Third , the possibility of re - infection was neglected here . 350 Given that the same viral strain circulated at this time of the pandemic , this phenomenon 351 was considered infrequent 24 . Finally , lack of availability of serological status in children < 5 352 years in the EpiCov cohort impeded us from investigating the role of very young children in 353 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . More studies should be carried out in this specific group in the 354 future . 355 In conclusion , our study provides estimates of the risk of acquisition of SARS - CoV - 2 within 356 and outside the household over the first two waves in France in 2020 .

Since November 359 2020 , the epidemiological context has drastically changed , with both the emergence of 360 variants of concern with increased transmissibility and widespread implementation of 361 vaccination .
