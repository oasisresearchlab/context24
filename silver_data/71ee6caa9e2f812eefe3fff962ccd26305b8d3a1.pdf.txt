Kirschner , February 6 , 2004 The Wave proteins are major activators of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex . The ubiquitous Wave - 2 is required for actin polymerization at the leading edge of migrating cells . Here we purify Wave - 2 from HeLa cells . Five proteins , Sra , Nap , Wave - 2 , Abi , and Hspc , are copuriﬁed , indicating that they form a tight complex . These proteins are only present in the complexed form , with the exception of Hspc , which displays a free pool . We reconstitute the Wave - 2 complex by cotranslating invitro theﬁvesubunitsandusethissystemtogether with speciﬁc immunoprecipitations to study the molecular archi - tecture of the complex . The complex is organized around a core of Nap and Abi . Sra is a peripheral subunit recruited on the Nap side , whereas the Wave and Hspc subunits are recruited on the Abi side of the core . T he actin cytoskeleton is required to ensure the proper shape of the eukaryotic cell . The dynamics of the actin monomer - polymer equilibrium are under tight control from the cell and are regulated by signal transduction cascades . Cell migration is typically initiated by growth factor stimulation . An essential structure for cell migration is the lamellipodium , which is the projection of the plasma membrane at the leading edge of a migrating cell ( 1 ) . Actin polymerization provides the driving force for this plasma membrane projection . The molecular processes responsible for localized actin polymerization are the subject of intense investigation because of their critical functions in the physiology of animal cells , for example , during cell shape changes and motility in development , and in pathology , for example , during tumorigenesis when tumor cells acquire an invasive behavior . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , which contains two actin - related pro - teins , is a major regulator of actin polymerization . In particular , the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex stimulates actin polymerization by actin filament branching on existing filaments ( 1 ) . In animal cells , the two major classes of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 activators are the WASP proteins and the Wave proteins . WASP proteins are dispensable for the formation of lamellipodia ( 2 , 3 ) , whereas Wave proteins have emerged as a critical regulator of this structure . In fact , Wave proteins are localized at the tip of the protruding lamellipodium and delocalized whenever this structure retracts ( 4 ) ; genetic inactivation of the ubiquitously expressed Wave - 2 gene causes defects in the formation of lamellipodia ( 5 , 6 ) . These results highlight the importance of the Wave – Arp2 (cid:1) 3 pathway in the formation of lamellipodia in migrating cells . The small GTPase Rac controls the formation of lamellipodia ( 7 ) . The formation of lamellipodia by active Rac is blocked by dominant negative constructs of Wave , suggesting that Wave is a downstream Rac effector ( 8 ) . However , no direct binding was detected , suggesting other intermediaries in this signaling path - way . The first identified link was IRSp53 , which was shown to bind to active Rac and to the ubiquitous Wave - 2 protein but very poorly to the other Wave proteins ( 9 ) . Recently , our group has purified a multiprotein complex containing the brain - specific Wave - 1 ( 10 ) . This complex maintained Wave - 1 in an inactive conformation . An active form of Wave - 1 was released on binding to active Rac ( 10 ) . We show here that the ubiquitously expressed Wave - 2 protein is in a similar large complex as the brain - specific Wave - 1 . We investigated the substructure of the Wave - 2 com - plex by using reconstitution of partial complexes and specific immunoprecipitations . This architecture , which may be general for Wave proteins , shows the complex built around a core of the Nap and Abi subunits . Materials and Methods Purification of the Wave - 2 Complex by Chromatography and Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry . HeLa - S3 cell pellets were obtained from the National Cell Culture Center ( Minneapolis , MN ) . All chromatography was performed at 4°C by using resins purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech . Cells were resuspended in 3 - fold their volume of XB buffer ( 20 mM Hepes (cid:1) 100 mM KCl (cid:1) 1 mM MgCl 2 (cid:1) 0 . 1 mM EDTA (cid:1) 1 mM DTT , pH 7 . 7 ) and lysed by nitrogen cavitation [ 500 psi for 20 min ( 1 psi (cid:1) 6 . 89 kPa ) ; Parr Instruments , Moline , IL ] . The extract was clarified by centrifugation ( 15 , 000 rpm for 15 min ; Beckman Coulter SA 600 rotor ) and ultracentrifugation ( 40 , 000 rpm for 2 h ; Beckman Coulter 45Ti rotor ) . The Wave complex was precipitated by an ammonium sulfate cut from 20 % to 30 % saturation , resuspended in 20 mM Pipes (cid:1) 50 mM KCl (cid:1) 1 mM MgCl 2 (cid:1) 0 . 1 mM EDTA (cid:1) 1 mM DTT , pH 6 . 8 , and loaded onto a 6 - ml Resource S column . The Wave complex was eluted with a linear gradient of KCl and came off at (cid:2) 130 mM KCl . The fractions then were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris (cid:1) 50 mM KCl (cid:1) 1 mM MgCl 2 (cid:1) 0 . 1 mM EDTA (cid:1) 1 mM DTT , pH 8 . 0 , and loaded onto a 1 - ml Mono Q column . The Wave complex was eluted with a linear gradient of KCl and came off at (cid:2) 330 mM KCl . The complex was then purified on a 12 - ml 5 – 20 % linear sucrose gradient ( see below ) . Protein identification by tandem mass spectrometry was as described ( 11 ) . Briefly , protein bands were excised from SDS (cid:1) PAGE gels and digested with sequencing - grade trypsin ( Pro - mega ) . Digested samples were pressure - loaded onto a fused silica microcapillary C18 column ( Magic beads ; Michrom BioResources , Auburn , CA ) packed in - house . An Agilent 1100 high - pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) system ( Agilent Technologies , Palo Alto , CA ) was used to deliver a gradient across a flow splitter to the column . Eluting peptides from the column were ionized by electrospray ionization and analyzed by an LCQ - Deca XP ion - trap mass spectrometer ( Thermo Finnigan , Woburn , MA ) . Peptide ions were dynamically selected by the operating software for fragmentation . The peptide frag - mentation spectra were searched against the nonredundant protein database by using the SEQUEST computer algorithm .

BC019303 ) were obtained by PCR of cDNA or the corresponding ESTs and cloned into pCS2 to express untagged proteins or into pCS2 - HA to express fusion proteins with a triple hemagglutinin ( HA ) tag in the N terminus . ORFs were sequenced to ensure that no mutation was introduced . Specific polyclonal sera were obtained after immunization of rabbits with the following KLH - conjugated peptides ( Zymed ) : Sra , ( C ) LVHPTDKYSNKDCPDSA ; Nap , ( C ) KKSKKQTGKKGEPEREK ; Wave - 2 , ( C ) NQRGSGLAGP - KRSS ; Abi , ( C ) SSGGYRRTPSV ; and Hspc , ( C ) IEYIEARVT - KGETLT . All of the antibodies were affinity - purified against the immobilized peptides . InVitroTranslation and Immunoprecipitations . In vitro translation of pairs of plasmids or of an equimolar mixture of the five plasmids was performed by using the SP6 polymerase and 40 (cid:1) Ci of [ 35 S ] methionine in a total reaction volume of 50 (cid:1) l with the TnT kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Promega ) . Four hundred fifty microliters of XB , 10 (cid:1) l of protein G ultralink beads ( Pierce ) , and 1 (cid:1) g of 12CA5 mAb then were added . The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4°C with rocking . The beads then were washed four times with 1 ml of XB and resuspended in SDS loading buffer . The inputs ( 1 (cid:1) 25th ) and the HA immu - noprecipitates ( 1 (cid:1) 3rd ) were analyzed by SDS (cid:1) PAGE on 4 – 12 % Bis - Tris gels with the Mes buffer ( Invitrogen ) . After migration , the gel was fixed in for 20 min , rinsed in water , incubated in 1 M of sodium salicylate , dried , and exposed to films or phospho - rimager screens ( Bio - Rad ) . Sucrose Gradient . Linear 5 – 20 % sucrose gradients were poured in XB by using the Auto Densi Flow from Labconco ( Kansas City , MO ) . Markers were chymotrypsinogen A 2 . 6 S , albumin 4 . 6 S , aldolase 7 . 3 S , catalase 11 . 3 S , thyroglobulin 19 . 2 S ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Two hundred microliters of markers , high - speed extract , or the in vitro translation reaction was loaded on top of the 12 - ml gradient . The gradients were run for 17 h at 40 , 000 rpm in a SW40 rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) . Fractions of (cid:2) 0 . 5 ml were harvested from the top by using the Auto Densi Flow . Fractions of the high - speed extract then were concentrated by using trichloroacetic acid precipitation with insulin as a carrier . Results To examine whether Wave - 2 was in a complex , as described for the brain - specific Wave - 1 protein , we purified Wave - 2 from HeLa cells after its immunoreactivity . We prepared a high - speed supernatant from a culture of 20 liters of cells . This extract then was sequentially fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipita - tion , two ion exchange columns , and a final sucrose gradient ( Fig . 1 ) . After these four steps , Wave - 2 had been purified together with four other proteins . These five proteins subse - quently were shown to form a tight complex ( see below ) , indicating that the procedure we describe here leads to the purification to homogeneity of the Wave - 2 complex . Mass spectrometry was used to identify the proteins present in the complex . The four detected bands , in decreasing size order , consisted of specifically Rac1 - associated protein , or p140Sra - 1 ( 12 ) ; Nck - associated protein 1 , or p125Nap1 ( 13 ) ; Wave - 2 ( 14 ) ; and Abl - interating protein 1 , or Abi - 1 ( 15 ) . In addition , when the final fraction was analyzed directly by mass spectrometry , a fifth protein of (cid:2) 8 kDa , called HSPC300 ( 10 ) , was unambiguously identified , even though a corresponding band after SDS (cid:1) PAGE was too weak to be detected . These proteins , or homologous proteins , already were found to be complexed with Wave - 1 purified from brain ( 10 , 16 ) . For all subunits except HSPC300 , paralogous genes exist in mammalian genomes , three for Wave - 2 and Abi - 1 and two for p140Sra - 1 and p125Nap1 . Moreover , multiple splice variants of Abi - 1 have been described ( 17 ) . In addition to the combinatorial complexity typically displayed by different tissues , it is likely that even a single cell type possesses slightly different Wave complexes , because we could detect a few peptides from the homologous PIR121 protein in the p140Sra - 1 band . For the rest of this article , the cDNAs corresponding to the Fig . 1 . PuriﬁcationoftheWave - 2 - containingcomplexfromHeLacells . After four steps of chromatography ( depicted on the left ) , the ﬁnal fractions obtained after the sucrose gradient were loaded on 5 – 15 % gradient poly - acrylamide gel . After SDS (cid:1) PAGE , the gel was silver - stained , and the bands wereexcisedandanalyzedbymassspectrometry . Inadditiontothefourclear bands , Hspc was not detected by the staining of the gel but was clearly detected when the complete fraction was analyzed by mass spectrometry . Fig . 2 .

For the sake of simplicity , these five proteins are referred to as Sra , Nap , Wave , Abi , and Hspc . To improve our understanding of Wave regulation , we at - tempted to devise experiments revealing the architecture of the Wave complex . First , we asked whether partial complexes or free pools of subunits exist . We fractionated the HeLa extract on a sucrose gradient and analyzed the distribution of the subunits by Western blot . The complex peaks in fractions 13 and 14 at (cid:2) 11 Swedbergs where all five proteins are detected ( Fig . 2 A ) . Im - portantly , Sra and Nap were present only in the complex because no other migrating forms could be detected . Wave and Abi are mostly present in the complex , but some faster migrating bands also were observed between fractions 5 and 8 . These additional bands might correspond to crossreacting proteins or degradation products of Abi and Wave . In contrast to the four other subunits , the major pool of Hspc was in the first fractions of the gradient , which correspond to a free form , with only the remaining portion being complexed in the 11 S complex . We then attempted to reconstitute the Wave complex to show that all of the subunits of the complex were identified . We expressed together the five cDNAs corresponding to the subunits in an in vitro translation system . The subunits were cotranslated in presence of [ 35 S ] me - thionine , and the reticulocyte lysate was loaded on a sucrose gradient . Importantly , a complex of all five proteins peaked in fractions 16 and 17 , corresponding to 11 S , like the native complex ( Fig . 2 B ) . This peak was particularly well seen with the Nap protein , which was produced in limiting amount , whereas the excess of the other subunits trailed behind the 11 S complex as free forms or partial complexes . This experiment suggested that all of the components of the Wave complex were identified and provided us with a system to study the interactions between subunits . To examine all of the possible interactions between pairs of subunits , we transferred the five cDNAs into a plasmid encoding three HA epitopes in fusion with the N terminus of proteins . We tested the interaction for a pair by coimmunoprecipitating an untagged subunit with a HA - tagged subunit by using HA antibodies ( Fig . 3 ) . This method of cotranslating in vitro the subunits with [ 35 S ] methionine proved to be highly sensitive , because many interactions were detected between subunits even though this system produces only a very small amount of proteins . First , we controlled for the background amount of protein we retrieved in the HA immunoprecipitation when no HA protein was expressed . This background varies according to the expressed subunit and probably reflects the propensity of each isolated subunit to precipitate and stick to the beads . An interaction was scored positive when the amount of untagged protein bound to the HA - tagged protein was significantly higher than this background amount . The HA - tagged Nap , Wave , Abi , and Hspc were efficiently immunoprecipitated . Surprisingly , HA - tagged Sra could not be significantly immunoprecipitated , even though it was produced ( data not shown ) and was not analyzed further . The following interactions were found signif - icant : HA - tagged Nap bound to both Sra and Abi ; HA - tagged Wave bound to both Hspc and Abi ; HA - tagged Abi bound to both Nap and Wave ; and HA - tagged Hspc bound to Wave . This system thus detected four interactions between the five subunits , suggesting a model for the architecture of the Wave complex as a stack of Sra , Nap , Abi , Wave , and Hspc , in that order . Such a linear model predicts that all of the more peripheral components would be lost when one central subunit is omitted from the reaction . Thus , to gain a better insight into the architecture of the Wave complex , we decided to assess the integrity of the complex when specific subunits were omitted . All possible combinations of omitted and immunoprecipitated sub - units were tested ( Fig . 4 ) . In this experiment , the reaction where one subunit is omitted was compared to the complete reaction by using the same immunoprecipitated subunit . This experiment permits the classification of subunits into peripheral or core Fig . 3 . Interactionsbetweensubunits .

Sra is a peripheral subunit of the complex . When Sra was omitted , a complex of Nap , Wave , Abi , and Hspc still formed , and to the same extent as when Sra was included . This result was seen when Nap was immunoprecipitated ( see reaction 3 vs . 2 ) , when Wave was immunoprecipitated ( 8 vs . 7 ) , when Abi was immunoprecipitated ( 13 vs . 12 ) , and when Hspc was immuno - precipitated ( 18 vs . 17 ) . In contrast , Nap is a core component of the complex that is essential for the recruitment of Sra . When Nap was omitted , a complex of Wave , Abi , and Hspc still formed but no longer recruited Sra . This result was most clearly seen when Hspc was immunoprecipitated ( 19 vs . 17 ) but also when Wave was immu - noprecipitated ( 9 vs . 7 ) and when Abi was immunoprecipitated ( 14 vs . 12 ) . Abi is also a core component . On the one hand , Abi recruits Nap and Sra . This result was seen when Hspc was immunopre - cipitated ( 21 vs . 17 ) and when Wave was immunoprecipitated ( 10 vs . 7 ) . On the other hand , Abi strongly enhanced the recruitment of Wave and Hspc when Nap was immunoprecipitated ( 5 vs . 2 ) . Wave is a peripheral subunit . When Wave was omitted , a complex of Sra , Nap , Abi , and Hspc still formed . This was most clearly seen when Hspc was immunoprecipitated ( 20 vs . 17 ) but also when Nap was immunoprecipitated ( 4 vs . 2 ) and when Abi was immunoprecipitated ( 15 vs . 12 ) . The fact that Hspc was not lost on Wave omission indicates that Hspc does not only interact with Wave , as detected in Fig . 3 , but also with another subunit . This other partner of Hspc is likely to be Abi , by elimination of the other candidates , because the immunoprecipitated Hspc did not coimmunoprecipitate Nap and Sra when Abi was omitted ( 21 vs . 17 ) . Hspc is also a peripheral subunit . When Hspc was omitted , a complex of Sra , Nap , Wave , and Abi still formed . This was most clearly seen when Nap was immunoprecipitated ( 6 vs . 2 ) but also when Wave was immunoprecipitated ( 11 vs . 7 ) and when Abi was immunoprecipitated ( 16 vs . 12 ) . In conclusion , the Wave complex is organized around a central core of Nap and Abi , which recruits the peripheral subunits , Sra on the Nap side and the Wave - Hspc unit on the other side , as depicted in Fig . 4 . Discussion Our purification of the ubiquitous Wave - 2 confirms the gener - ality of the Wave complex . The same or homologous subunits previously were found in complex with the brain - specific Wave - 1 ( 10 ) . IRSp53 , which previously was proposed to control specif - ically the activity of Wave - 2 ( 9 ) , was not part of the complex . It thus is likely that IRSp53 is only transiently recruited in response to an activating signal . Our reconstitution provides evidence that all of the subunits of the complex actually have been identified . Importantly , recent genetic evidence indicates that this structure of complex is also important for the regulation of invertebrate Wave proteins , known as Scar proteins . Indeed , inactivation of the Sra homolog in Dictyostelium or of Sra , Nap , and Abi homologs in Drosophila leads in both cases to Scar (cid:1) Wave phenotypes ( 18 – 21 ) . In addition , in both systems , on genetic removal of the subunits , Scar (cid:1) Wave is degraded . In line with our finding that Hspc is present in excess in the HeLa cell extract , RNA interference depletion of the Hspc homologous protein in Drosophila cells results in a milder phenotype than the corre - sponding depletion of the other subunits ( 19 , 20 ) . Together with our biochemical analysis of subunit distribution , these results suggest that the Wave complex is the only stable entity in vertebrate and invertebrate cells . This evidence suggests that the architecture of the human Wave - 2 complex defined here is likely to hold true for the invertebrate Scar (cid:1) Wave complexes . We have found that the interacting subunits Nap and Abi provide the core of the complex , because they are essential for the recruitment of peripheral subunits to the complex . The Sra subunit is recruited by Nap to the core , and the interacting Wave and Hspc subunits are recruited by Abi to the core . This protein complex maintains Wave in an inactive conformation , because the isolated recombinant Wave protein , but not the Wave complex , activates the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ( 10 , 22 ) . We found that Abi and Hspc are the only two subunits interacting directly with Wave within the complex and are thus the likely mediators of this inhibition of Wave . However , Hspc is not sufficient to inhibit Wave because the active form of Wave is a complex of Wave and Hspc ( 10 ) . Abi is also not sufficient for this inhibition ( A . G . , unpublished data ) . It is likely that the inhibition of Wave requires not only the direct interactors Abi and Hspc but also the folding constraints provided by the complex that is the stable biochem - Fig . 4 . Reconstitution of all possible complexes lacking one subunit . The ﬁve subunits were cotranslated in vitro in the presence of [ 35 S ] methionine . The HA - tagged subunit is indicated by (cid:1) , and the omitted subunit is indicated by (cid:4) . The presence of all of the untagged subunits is not indicated for the sake of clarity . For each reaction , two lanes are shown , the input on the left and the HA immunoprecipitate on the right . 4382 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:1) cgi (cid:1) doi (cid:1) 10 . 1073 (cid:1) pnas . 0400628101 Gautreau et al . ical entity . On activation of the complex , the active unit com - posed of the Wave and Hspc is released ( 10 ) . The GTP - loaded Rac activator binds to the Sra subunit ( 12 ) . This suggests that Rac binding to Sra on the Nap side of the complex triggers a conformational change that is transferred to the Abi side and eventually results in the dissociation of the Wave - Hspc unit . The reconstitution of a multiprotein complex by using in vitro translation is a general approach to study the interactions among subunits . We have used this system to test , in a systematic manner , all possible interactions between the subunits of the ubiquitous Wave complex by coimmunoprecipitations . These experiments allowed us to draw a map of interactions . This map constitutes a working model to integrate the architecture and the regulation of the Wave complex . It also provides essential information to form partial complexes in bacteria and insect cells by coexpressing interacting subunits to reconstitute a large amount of Wave complex for structural studies . In contrast to the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ( 23 ) , this reconstitution of the Wave complex is likely required for crystallography , given the combinatorial complexity of the native mammalian Wave complexes .
