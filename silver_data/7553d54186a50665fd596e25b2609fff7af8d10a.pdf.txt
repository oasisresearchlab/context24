This regulation is due to both speciﬁc lipid - protein inter - actions and general bilayer - protein interactions , which modulate the energetics and kinetics of protein conformational transitions , as well as the protein distribution between different membrane compart - ments . The bilayer regulation of membrane protein function arises from the hydrophobic coupling between the protein’s hydrophobic domains and the bilayer hydrophobic core , which causes protein conformational changes that involve the protein / bilayer boundary to perturb the adjacent bilayer . Such bilayer perturbations , or de - formations , incur an energetic cost , which for a given conforma - tional change varies as a function of the bilayer material properties ( bilayer thickness , intrinsic lipid curvature , and the elastic compres - sion and bending moduli ) . Protein function therefore is regulated by changes in bilayer material properties , which determine the free - energy changes caused by the protein - induced bilayer deformation . The lipid bilayer thus becomes an allosteric regulator of membrane function . 107 A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l . S t r u c t . 2007 . 36 : 107 - 130 .

Studies on the uncatalyzed permeation of small solutes ( 33 , 115 ) show that the bilayer barrier properties approximate those of a thin sheet of liquid hy - drocarbon , whichis ∼ 30 ˚Athick . Thisapprox - imation has proven useful for understanding the physical principles governing the uncat - alyzed movement of small molecules across biological membranes . It does not , however , provide a realistic basis for understanding the regulation of membrane protein func - tion by the lipid bilayer ( 11 ) . For this pur - pose , it is necessary to consider the lipid bi - layer as a liquid - crystalline body ( 72 , 105 ) with both short - range and long - range order and ( locally ) well - deﬁned material properties ( 31 , 73 ) . REGULATION OF MEMBRANE PROTEIN FUNCTION BY THE LIPID BILAYER The lipid bilayer component of biological membranes is important for the distribution , organization , and function of membrane pro - teins and thus for many cell functions ( 10 , 25 , 42 , 59 , 60 , 72 , 101 , 106 ) . Although the importance of the membrane lipids for dif - ferent cell functions was appreciated long ago , mechanistic understanding of how the membrane lipid composition regulates mem - brane protein folding , trafﬁcking , organi - zation , and function is only beginning to emerge—notwithstanding seminal contribu - tions by Israelachvili ( 46 ) and Sackmann ( 99 ) . Not surprisingly , the membrane lipid regula - tion of membrane protein function has been formulated with different descriptors : bilayer ﬂuidity ( 103 ) ; bilayer compression , or bilayer - protein hydrophobic mismatch ( 79 ) ; intrin - sic lipid curvature ( 38 ) or curvature frustra - tion ( 60 ) ; bilayer deformation energy ( 44 ) ; acyl chain packing ( 32 ) ; bilayer free volume ( 75 ) ; lateral pressure proﬁle ( 14 ) ; lipid pack - ing stress ( 9 ) ; or bilayer stiffness ( 68 ) . These different descriptors constitute different at - tempts to parameterize the landscape of lat - eral interactions among the membrane lipids and the imbedded proteins . One reason for this plethora of paradigms is that the lipid composition of biological membranes is diverse ( 12 , 34 ) and differs among membrane compartments ( 94 ) . Ery - throcyte membranes are estimated to have more than 200 lipid species that differ in head group and acyl chain composition ( 80 ) , and the number of distinct lipid species in the cellular lipidome is likely to be in the thousands ( 117 ) . As pointed out elsewhere in this volume ( 32a ) , the membrane lipids 108 Andersen · Koeppe A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l . S t r u c t . 2007 . 36 : 107 - 130 .

ANRV311 - BB36 - 06 ARI 3 April 2007 17 : 2 have a nonrandom distribution , which in its own right has consequences for mem - brane protein function . Given this diversity and complexity , one might expect membrane proteins to be regulated by both speciﬁc lipid - protein interactions and general bilayer - protein interactions . The distinction between speciﬁc ( chemical ) lipid - protein interactions and more general ( physical ) bilayer - protein interactions is often unclear , however , as ge - netic studies have revealed a remarkable plas - ticity in membrane lipid composition ( 26 ) . In fact , when lipid molecules can be discerned and identiﬁed in membrane protein struc - tures , they usually are resolved only in part ( 59 , 60 ) —even at cryogenic temperatures— suggesting limited chemical speciﬁcity , signif - icant disorder / mobility , or both . Whether the regulation is due to general or speciﬁc interactions , the membrane lipids regulate membrane protein function by al - tering the energetics and / or kinetics of the membrane protein conformational changes that underlie normal function ( Figure 1 ) . It is important that the lipid bilayer has a liquid - crystalline organization ( 72 ) , which is necessary to allow for conformational changes that involve the protein - lipid bound - r 0 : radius of bilayer - spanning protein l : hydrophobic length of a bilayer - spanning protein ary . Yet , changes in lipid bilayer ﬂuidity per se , which would alter only the kinetics of interconverting between different protein conformations , are unlikely to be important regulators of membrane protein function ( 58 ) . Most importantly , changes in ﬂuidity alone cannot alter the equilibrium distribu - tion among different protein conformational states . The control of membrane protein function by the lipid bilayer becomes primar - ily a question of energetics—of changes in the equilibrium distribution among different conformations . Moreover , the diversity of membrane lipids , and the limited chemical speciﬁcity of lipid - protein interactions , suggests that it of - ten may be advantageous to dispense with the notion of speciﬁc lipid - protein interac - tions and adopt instead an energetic view of bilayer - protein interactions . In this view , the bilayer and the adjacent aqueous phases serve as a ( highly structured ) solvent for the bilayer - spanning proteins . In this approximation , it becomes useful to focus on the protein shape and the bilayer material properties .

Changes in bilayer properties can alter the free energy between the states ( top right ) , which alters both the equilibriumdistribution as well as the kinetics of the transition , or the height of the transition state ( lower right ) , which alters only the kinetics of the transition . www . annualreviews . org • Hydrophobic Match and Mismatch 109 A nnu .

Support for such a physical view of the bi - layer regulation of membrane protein func - tion resides in the fact that it is often possible to reconstitute membrane proteins in lipid bi - layersofdeﬁnedcomposition , i . e . , havingonly one or two components in addition to the pro - tein . This suggests , in itself , that membrane protein function does not depend on spe - ciﬁc lipid - protein interactions . One cannot exclude , however , that functionally important lipids bind so tightly that they should be con - sidered structural cofactors . It also becomes possible to examine systematically whether a membrane protein’s function varies as a func - tion of the lipid bilayer thickness ( Table 1 ) or the intrinsic lipid curvature ( Table 2 ) . Tables 1 and 2 show that membrane proteins are regulated by simple changes in bilayer properties , such as the bilayer ( hydropho - bic ) thickness and intrinsic lipid curvature . Manyproteinsappearin Table 1 and Table 2 , which suggests a common underlying mech - anism . Similar information would have been obtained if one had focused on proteins that are modulated by cholesterol or by reversibly adsorbing amphiphiles ( 64 , 68 , 122 ) . We do not consider these membrane modiﬁcations here , because cholesterol and reversibly ad - sorbing amphiphiles tend to alter the bilayer elastic moduli ( 30 , 70 , 83 , 124 ) , in addition to their effects on bilayer thickness ( 84 ) and intrinsic curvature ( 19 , 102 ) . Also , we do not consider peripheral membrane proteins . A remarkable feature of the bilayer reg - ulation of many bilayer - spanning proteins is the biphasic changes in function with changes in a particular bilayer property , whether it be thickness , curvature ( Tables 1 and 2 ) , or cholesterol content ( 122 ) . Figure 2 shows this pattern for ATP - driven pumps and other transporters . This biphasic behavior could arise for many reasons ( 60 ) , but it represents a general feature of the host lipid bilayer reg - ulation of membrane proteins that undergo conformational changes involving the pro - tein / bilayer boundary . We return to this ques - tion at the end of this article .

HYDROPHOBIC MATCH AND MISMATCH A central feature in models of lipid bilayer – integral membrane protein interactions , and bilayer regulation of membrane protein func - tion , isthehydrophobicmatchbetweenmem - brane proteins and their host lipid bilayer : The hydrophobic thickness ( d ) of the host lipid bilayer in the immediate vicinity of a membrane - spanning protein should closely match the hydrophobic length ( l ) of the pro - tein’s hydrophobic ( bilayer - spanning ) domain ( Figure 3 ) . This arrangement minimizes the energetic penalty associated with exposing a nonpolar / polar interface ( 50 ) . For a given protein , if l differs from the average thick - ness of the unperturbed bilayer ( d 0 ) , there is a bilayer - protein hydrophobic mismatch ( 32 , 79 ) . In response , the bilayer thickness in the vicinity of the protein may differ from the un - perturbed bilayer thickness ; this bilayer de - formation may involve local compression or extension of the lipid acyl chains , bending of the bilayer / solution interface and splaying of the lipid acyl chains ( Figure 3 ) , and per - haps tilting of the acyl chain director rela - tive to the bilayer normal . If l (cid:3) = d there is notahydrophobicmatchbetweenproteinand bilayer ( 7 ) , but rather hydrophobic slippage ( 86 ) , the energetically unfavorable exposure of hydrophobic amino acid residues to water 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 T r a n s po r t ac t i v i t y ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) Acyl chain length 0 20 40 60 80 100 Figure 2 Transport activity as a function of lipid bilayer thickness : sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + - ATPase ( 13 ) ( purple ) ; Lactobacillus lactis Leu - H + cotransporter ( 45 ) ( red ) ; Escherichia coli melibiose - cation cotransporter ( 27 ) ( blue ) . www . annualreviews . org • Hydrophobic Match and Mismatch 111 A nnu .

Nonpolar residues are gray ; polar residues are blue . ( a ) Perfect hydrophobic match : The protein hydrophobic length ( l ) matches the thickness of the unperturbed bilayer ( d 0 ) . ( b , c ) Hydrophobic mismatch : The protein’s hydrophobic length is longer ( b ) or shorter ( c ) than the hydrophobic thickness of the unperturbed bilayer . The lipid bilayer hydrophobic core adjusts to the protein’s hydrophobic exterior , which causes a local compression or stretching , with an energy density 1 / 2 · K a · ( 2 u / d 0 ) 2 ( cf . Reference 79 ) , and bending of the bilayer / solution interface , with an energy density we approximate as 1 / 2 · K c · ( ∇ 2 u − c 0 ) 2 ( cf . Reference 38 ) . Δ G 0def : bilayer deformation energy or of hydrophilic residues to the lipid bilayer hydrophobic core . In principle , both the bilayer and the pro - tein may deform in response to a hydrophobic mismatch , d 0 (cid:3) = l . In practice , membrane pro - teins are much less compressible than the bi - layer . The volumetric compressibility moduli of globular proteins in water are 10 10 – 10 11 N / m 2 ( 35 ) —one to two orders of magni - tude larger than the volumetric compressibil - ity moduli of liquid - crystalline phospholipid bilayers , ∼ 10 9 N / m 2 ( 62 ) , and two to three orders of magnitude larger than the modu - lus for bilayer thickness compressibility , ∼ 10 8 N / m 2 ( 31 ) . That is , lipid bilayers are 100 - to 1000 - fold softer than the imbedded pro - teins , meaning that hydrophobic matching implies that the bilayer adjusts to the pro - tein . As noted below ( see Bilayer Deforma - tion Energy ) , though the bilayer is soft , the bilayer deformation nevertheless incurs a ﬁ - nite energetic cost , the bilayer deformation energy ( (cid:2) G 0def ) , which in turn causes bilayer - spanning proteins to adjust their conforma - tional preference in favor of conformations with smaller hydrophobic mismatches . ( Indi - vidual α - helices and protein domains are rel - atively rigid ; the adjustment most likely in - volves small ratchet - like rotation and sliding movements of domains and helices relative to each other . ) Thus , even when the hydropho - bicmismatchbetweenabilayer - spanningpro - tein and its host bilayer is small , the hy - drophobic coupling between the protein and the bilayer may constrain the conformational landscapeavailabletotheprotein—thebilayer serves as a splint to stabilize selected protein conformations . 112 Andersen · Koeppe A nnu .

Blue , nitrogen ; red , oxygen ; white , hydrogen ; yellow , phosphorus . Figure courtesy of Toby W . Allen . Because lipid bilayers are soft , the bilayer / solution interface undergoes substantial ther - mal ﬂuctuations ( 118 ) , which involve the local movement of individual phospholipid molecules and more global bilayer undu - lations and peristaltic motions ( 61 , 118 ) ( Figure 4 ) . The bilayer / solution interface thus is fuzzy . Nevertheless , the average bilayer thicknessisawell - deﬁnedquantity , albeitwith a somewhat gradual transition between the nonpolar bilayer core and the polar groups and water . Similarly , the thermal motion in bilayer - spanning proteins , in particular the side chain motions in the vicinity of the bi - layer / solution interface , causes the transition between the protein’s nonpolar and polar do - mains to be gradual . The hydrophobic mis - matchbetweenabilayer - spanningproteinand the host bilayer thus is subject to uncertainty . Differences in hydrophobic mismatch , due to changes in phospholipid acyl chain length or the amino acid sequence of the bilayer - spanning protein domains , should be well - deﬁned quantities . EVIDENCE FOR HYDROPHOBIC MATCH What is the experimental evidence for bilayer ( and protein ) structural alter - ations in response to a hydrophobic mismatch ? The best available evidence comes from deﬁned models ( Figure 5 ) such as β - helical gramicidin channels ( 6 ) and single - span α - helical peptides like acetyl - GWW ( LA ) n LWWA - amide ( WALP ) ( 55 , 56 ) www . annualreviews . org • Hydrophobic Match and Mismatch 113 A nnu .

Space - ﬁlling models of ( a ) WALP16 , acetyl - GWW ( LA ) 5 WWA - amide , ( b ) gramicidin A , and ( c ) WALP19 , acetyl - GWW ( LA ) 6 LWWA - amide . In the gramicidin dimer , the interfacial Trp residues are shown in dark green or dark orange ( to highlight each subunit in the dimer ) , with the indole NH hydrogens colored gray , whereas the aliphatic side chains are shown in light green or light orange to identify the two subunits . In the WALPs , the indole nitrogens are dark blue within green rings , with the indole NH hydrogens colored gray . In all three models the peptide backbone is light blue , green , and red . Note how the peptide backbone is more exposed in the WALPs than in gramicidin A . incorporated into lipid bilayers of different thicknesses . Lipid Adaptations In the case of a large hydrophobic mismatch ( > 4 ˚A difference ) between short bilayer - spanning peptides and thick host bilayers , the ensuing bilayer deformation tends to desta - bilize the lipid bilayer . At peptide / lipid ratios larger than ∼ 1 : 100 , the bilayer structure may be severely disrupted in favor of nonbilayer phases : an isotropic or an inverted hexago - nal ( H II ) phase . In phosphatidylcholine bilay - ers , theselipid - phasetransitionscanbecaused by both gramicidins ( 53 ) and WALP - like peptides including acetyl - GKK ( LA ) n LKKA - amide ( KALP ) ( 24 , 56 ) , as long as the peptides have interfacial anchoring residues , e . g . , Trp indole rings or cationic Lys / Arg side chains , at either end of the peptides . Peptides lacking polar / charged anchors tend to have only little inﬂuence on the lipid phase behavior ( 54 , 57 ) . A hydrophobic mismatch between long peptides and thin bilayers formed by phos - phatidylcholines , which have little tendency to form nonbilayer phases , usually preserves the lipid bilayer phase ( 22 ) . If the bilayer is formedbylipidsthathaveagreaterpropensity to form nonbilayer phases , such as N - methyl - DC 18 : 1 PE , both short and long WALP pep - tides promote the formation of inverse cu - bic and H II phases ( 104 ) , indicating that a peptide - bilayer hydrophobic mismatch and an intrinsic lipid curvature act synergistically . In cases in which only marginal hydropho - bic mismatch occurs , the lipid bilayer phase is preserved even at peptide / lipid ratios of ∼ 1 : 10 . WALPpeptideshavemodestinﬂuence on lipid acyl chain order or bilayer thickness : The effects tend to be smaller in magnitude than would be predicted a priori from the ex - tent of hydrophobic mismatch ( 23 , 116 ) . On a per mole basis , the lipid adaptations to grami - cidinchannelsaregreaterthanthosetosingle - span α - helices ( cf . References 39 and 116 ) . The reason for this difference remains poorly understood , but examination of the structures in Figure 5 shows that the peptide backbone residues are more exposed in the WALPs than 114 Andersen · Koeppe A nnu .

Indeed , X - ray scattering mea - surements show that gramicidin channels , at a peptide - to - lipid molar ratio of 1 : 10 , increase the thickness of DC 12 PC bilayers by 1 . 3 ˚A but decrease the thickness of DC 14 PC bilay - ers by 2 . 6 ˚A ( 39 ) , whereas WALP peptides of comparable lengths and molar ratios have lit - tleeffectonthethicknessofeitherDC 12 PCor DC 14 PC bilayers ( 116 ) . Consistent with these results , gramicidin channels increase the or - der of lipid acyl chains to a greater extent than do lipid - incorporated WALP peptides ( 23 ) . Compared with single - span α - helices , gram - icidin channels are more robust ( more rigid ) , have larger diameters , and therefore might be expected to better mimic larger bilayer - spanning proteins . Model Protein Adaptations In cases in which the lipid bilayer phase is pre - served , does a hydrophobic mismatch modu - late the folding or orientation of embedded protein domains ? The linear gramicidins can fold as single - stranded β - helical subunits ( cf . Reference 6 ) , which form the standard con - ducting channels by a transbilayer dimeriza - tion ( 88 ) , as well as various double - stranded conformations ( cf . Reference 6 ) . The single - stranded , bilayer - spanning gramicidin chan - nel structure is maintained in lipid bilayers having acyl chain lengths between 10 and 18 carbons . The single - stranded channel fold is maintained even in micelles formed by the 12 - carbon , single - chain detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) ( 8 , 111 ) . Molecular dynamics - based analysis of the structures de - duced from solution NMR spectra of grami - cidin in SDS micelles ( 8 , 111 ) and solid - state NMR spectra of gramicidin incorporated into oriented lipid bilayers ( 52 ) shows that the structures are equivalent ( 2 ) . In shorter ( micelle - forming ) six - to eight - carbon dia - cyl phosphatidylcholines , gramicidin refolds into double - stranded structures ( 37 ) . At the other extreme , in DC 22 : 1 PC bilayers , double - stranded gramicidin conformations again be - come prominent ( 76 ) . In either case , the hy - drophobic mismatch can become so large that the resulting bilayer deformation ( and asso - ciated deformation energy ) causes a switch in gramicidin’s conformational preference . The interfacial tryptophans are important determinants of the gramicidin fold , pre - sumably because the Trp residues serve to anchor the subunits to the interface ( 88 ) , as analogues with Trp → Phe replacements tend to favor double - stranded conformations ( 28 , 100 ) . WALP peptides tend to remain α - helical in phospholipid bilayers with 12 - to 18 - carbon acyl chains , with a modest ( 4 ◦ to 8 ◦ ) tilt of the helix axis with respect to the bi - layer normal ( 108 , 109 , 114a ) . Very long , 23 - amino - acid WALPs or KALPs remain largely α - helical but adapt to short lipid bilayers , with a single distinct kink halfway through the membrane - spanning helix at the bilayer center ( 20 ) . Integral Membrane Proteins Integral membrane proteins show be - havior similar to the gramicidins and WALPs / KALPs . When the β - barrel protein OmpF was reconstituted in lipid vesicles formed by DC n : 1 PC ( 12 ≤ n ≤ 24 ) , the protein appeared to be structurally invariant for 14 ≤ n ≤ 20 , with the hydrophobic match achieved by the lipid bilayer adapt - ing to the protein’s hydrophobic exterior ( 87 ) ; for n > 20 , the protein appeared to deform in response to the hydrophobic mismatch ( 89 ) . Similar experiments with the tetrameric α - helical KcsA channel ( 119 ) and the pentameric α - helical MscL ( 96 ) show that hydrophobic matching prevails , but that the protein organization varies as a function of the hydrophobic mismatch . It is not clear whether the changes in protein structure reﬂect a gradual change in the tilt of the α - helices relative to each other , or a shift in the distribution between a few protein www . annualreviews . org • Hydrophobic Match and Mismatch 115 A nnu .

Except for the extreme case of gramicidin channel refolding , the general picture is that hydrophobic matching is operative and that lipids , model proteins , and integral mem - brane proteins adapt to hydrophobic mis - match by rather small adjustments , which include a local bilayer deformation as well as shifts in the distribution between differ - ent protein conformations—with the major changes occurring in the lipid organization . β - barrel / β - helical proteins appear to be more rigid , imposing a greater restraint on the lipid packing ; α - helicalproteinsappeartobesofter . Whether the changes in protein structure re - ﬂect gradual changes in the tilt of individual α - helices relative to each other or shifts in the distribution among a few discrete con - formations , the molecular responses to mis - match may have great functional signiﬁcance while being modest in scope and difﬁcult to detect . BILAYER DEFORMATION ENERGY Although the bilayer is soft , the bilayer per - turbation associated with a bilayer - protein hydrophobic mismatch incurs an energetic cost , the bilayer deformation energy ( (cid:2) G 0def ) , which varies as a function of the hydropho - bic mismatch ( d 0 − l ) and the intrinsic lipid curvature ( c 0 ) . Intrinsic Lipid Curvature The intrinsic curvature of the membrane lipids denotes the tendency of lipids to form nonbilayer phases , i . e . , the tendency for iso - lated lipid monolayers to form nonplanar , curved surfaces . The intrinsic curvature of a lipidmonolayerisdeterminedbythevariation of intermolecular lateral interactions along the molecular axis ( 41 , 102 ) , which often is expressed in terms of the effective shape of the lipids in the monolayer ( 19 , 46 ) . There are strong attractive interactions at the non - polar / polar interface , to minimize the expo - sure of the hydrophobic acyl chains to water , and there are repulsive interactions between the polar head groups and between the acyl chains ( Figure 6 ) . The integral of the force proﬁle along the lipids ( across the monolayer ) is zero . If there is no net torque across the monolayer , the lipids can be approximated as having a cylindrical shape ( 102 ) . They form ﬂatmonolayers , andtwomonolayerscometo - gether to form a relaxed bilayer ( Figure 6 ) . If there is a torque across the monolayer , e . g . , if the effective cross - sectional area of the po - lar head group region is larger than that of the acyl chains , the monolayer has a positive equi - librium curvature ( Figure 7 c ) , meaning that the monolayer is convex when viewed from the aqueous solution , and the intrinsic lipid curvature , c 0 , is positive . If the effective cross - sectional area of the polar head groups is less than that of the acyl chains , the monolayer has a negative curvature ( Figure 7 d ) , meaning that the monolayer is concave when viewed from the aqueous solution , and the intrinsic lipid curvature , c 0 , is negative . In either case , whether c 0 is positive , zero , or negative , two monolayer leaﬂets can form a bilayeriftheyhavecomplementarycurvatures ( Figure 7 e ) . The formation of a ( planar ) bi - layer by lipids that by themselves would tend to form curved monolayers therefore changes the effective shape of the lipid molecules be - cause of the requirement for a uniform cross - sectional area / molecule across a planar bi - layer . The energy required to change the lipid shape causes a stress in the bilayer , with an energy density of ( K c / 2 ) · c 20 , where K c ≈ 20 – 25 k B T for liquid - crystalline phospholipid bi - layersthathavesaturatedormonounsaturated acyl chains ( 98 ) . c 0 is likely to vary between − 0 . 115 nm − 1 ( for DC 18 : 1 PC ) and − 0 . 34 nm − 1 ( for DC 18 : 1 PE ) ( 97 ) , meaning that the curva - ture frustration energy will vary between ∼ 0 . 2 and ∼ 2 k B T · nm − 2 . For comparison , the area per lipid molecule is ∼ 0 . 7 nm 2 ( 81 ) . The coupling between the two monolay - ers ( or leaﬂets ) in a bilayer , which forces them 116 Andersen · Koeppe A nnu . R e v .

Moreover , the elastic moduli of the shell of lipids adjacent to the protein , the so - called annular lipids ( 60 ) , may differ from the bulkvalues ( 91 ) , whichsimilarlyaffectthepre - dicted (cid:2) G 0 def . Yet , the biquadratic organiza - tion of Equation 2 should remain correct to the ﬁrst signiﬁcant order ( see below ) . Testing the Theory of Elastic Bilayer Deformations The theory of elastic bilayer deformations , as expressed in Equations 1 and 2 , provides quantitative insight into the bilayer - thickness dependence of gramicidin channel lifetimes ( 36 , 44 , 65 ) . Gramicidin channels form by the transmembrane dimerization of two non - H B , H X , and H C : phenomenologicalspringcoefﬁcientsdescribingtheenergeticsofaprotein - induced bilayer deformation conducting β 6 . 3 - helical subunits ( 88 ) ; chan - nel formation is visible as rectangular current transitions ( Figure 8 a ) . The channels’ hydrophobic length is less than the bilayer’s hydrophobic thickness , meaning that channel formation causes a bi - layer deformation with an associated (cid:2) G 0def . In response , the bilayer pulls on the bilayer - spanning channel with the disjoining force , F dis = − (cid:5) − ∂(cid:2) G 0def ∂ ( d 0 − l ) (cid:6) = 2 H B · ( d 0 − l ) + H X · c 0 . 3 . F dis varies as a function of the bilayer - channel hydrophobic mismatch , which means that the channel lifetime ( the inverse of the dimer dis - sociation rate constant ) varies as a function of the hydrophobic mismatch . The changes in channel lifetimes are comparable , whether the channel length ( the number of residues in the sequence , N AA ) or the bilayer thickness ( the number of CH 2 units in the acyl chains , N C ) is varied . ( Perfect agreement is not ex - pected because the subunit - subunit interface , and therefore the intrinsic channel dynamics , varies with changes in channel length . ) Thus , the gramicidin channels are suitable for use as molecular force transducers to monitor bi - layermaterialproperties ( andprotein - lipidbi - layer interactions ) ( also see References 5 and 64 ) . The theory of elastic bilayer deformations has been tested by examining how the single - channel lifetimes vary as a function of lipid bilayer thickness ( 29 , 44 , 65 ) or bilayer ten - sion ( 36 ) . It is possible to account quanti - tatively for lifetime changes using indepen - dently measured elastic moduli—but only by assuming that the energetic penalty for tilting the acyl chain director relative to the bilayer normal is high ( 44 , 65 ) , which constrains the lipid packing and thereby increases the value of (cid:2) G 0def ( and thus the magnitude of F dis ) . A similar conclusion was reached by examin - ing how the channel lifetimes ( and appearance rates ) vary as a function of the bilayer tension ( 36 ) . It is not clear , however , if the conclu - sion about lipid tilt reﬂects the uncertainties www . annualreviews . org • Hydrophobic Match and Mismatch 119 A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l .

( a ) Gramicidin channels form by means of the transmembrane dimerization of nonconducting subunits , which is observable as discrete current transition between two levels : 0 , in which there is no conducting channel , and 1 , in which there is one conducting channel . Because channel formation causes a local bilayer thinning , the bilayer responds by imposing a disjoining force on the channel . The magnitude of this force varies as a function of the channel - bilayer hydrophobic mismatch , which means that the average channel lifetimes vary as a function of the hydrophobic mismatch . ( b , c ) Gramicidin channel lifetimes vary as a function of the hydrophobic mismatch , characterized by N C − N AA , where N C denotes the number of carbon atoms in the acyl chains of the bilayer - forming monounsaturated phosphatidylcholines and N AA denotes the number of amino acids in the sequence . In panels b and c , the parameter that is changed is in red and blue , respectively . Modiﬁed after Reference 5 . associated with using a continuum descrip - tion at the molecular level ( also see Reference 91 ) . [ An alternative description of elastic bi - layer deformations , based on lipid acyl chain splay and tilt , can be found in Reference 57a . In its present implementation the predicted bilayer deformation energies are too low to be compatible with experimental results ( cf . References 57a , 65 , and 87 ) . ] Inothertests , whichexaminemoregeneral features of the model , the relative distribution of the different conductance levels in alame - thicin channels varies as an approximately lin - ear function of c 0 ( and , contrary to what might have been expected , not c 20 , see also Equation 4 ) ( 51 ) , and the gramicidin channel lifetimes vary as a function of c 0 ( 69 ) . The theory of elastic bilayer deformations provides a basis for understanding the energetics of bilayer - protein interactions . Energetics of a Hydrophobic Mismatch To calculate the energetic cost of a change in hydrophobic mismatch , consider the transfer of a bilayer - spanning protein of hydrophobic length l from a bilayer with a hydrophobic thickness d 1 to a bilayer with a hydrophobic thickness d 2 ( (cid:3) = d 1 ) ( cf . Reference 66 ) . Us - ing Equation 2 , and assuming that H B , H X , and H C vary little between the two bilay - ers , the free energy of transfer ( (cid:2)(cid:2) G d 1 → d 2 def ) becomes (cid:2)(cid:2) G d 1 → d 2 def = H B · ( d 2 − l ) 2 + H X · ( d 2 − l ) · c 0 + H C · c 20 − (cid:7) H B · ( d 1 − l ) 2 + H X · ( d 1 − l ) · c 0 + H C · c 20 (cid:8) = H B · ( d 2 − d 1 ) · ( d 2 + d 1 − 2 · l ) + H X · ( d 2 − d 1 ) · c 0 . 4 . 120 Andersen · Koeppe A nnu .

The solute is released to that solution , and the empty transporter undergoes another confor - mational change , such that the binding site again becomes accessible from the ﬁrst so - lution , ready for a new cycle . These confor - mational changes involve the protein / bilayer interface ( 112 ) , meaning that (cid:2) G 0def may be different for transporters having their bind - ing site exposed to the left and to the right solution . Approximatingtheconformationalchange associated with the shift in binding site ac - cessibility as a change in the protein’s hy - drophobic length , the bilayer contribution to the free - energy difference between two pro - tein conformations of lengths l 1 and l 2 is given by ( cf . Equation 4 ) (cid:2)(cid:2) G l 1 → l 2 def = H B · ( l 2 − l 1 ) · ( l 2 + l 1 − 2 · d 0 ) − H X · ( l 2 − l 1 ) · c 0 . 7 . H B and H X can be evaluated in a man - ner similar to that used in Reference 85 , and Equation 7 then provides estimates for (cid:2)(cid:2) G l 1 → l 2 def and the equilibrium distribution between the two conformations as a function of d 0 ( Figure 10 b , top and middle ) . Using a standard conformational transporter model ( 3 ) , the ﬂux - d 0 relation can be calculated ( Figure 10 b , bottom ) . Though the assumed change in the protein’s hydrophobic length is modest ( 0 . 03 nm ) , the ﬂux is a biphasic func - tion of bilayer thickness ( cf . Figure 2 ) . In the calculations used to generate Figure 10 , the ﬂux is maximal when the d 0 is equal to the pro - tein’s average hydrophobic length ( l 1 + l 2 ) / 2 , when the kinetic consequences of the protein - bilayer hydrophobic mismatch are minimal . The biphasic relation between transporter function and bilayer thickness arises as a gen - eralconsequenceofthehydrophobiccoupling between membrane protein function and bi - layer material properties . CONCLUSIONS The theory of elastic bilayer deformations provides a robust framework for understand - ing the bilayer regulation of membrane pro - tein function . The key element is that not only is there hydrophobic matching between a bilayer - spanning protein and the host bi - layer , but there is hydrophobic coupling of protein function to the bilayer material prop - erties ( 64 ) . The lipid bilayer thus becomes an allosteric regulator of membrane function . A key element in the continuum model of elastic bilayer deformations , as represented in Equations 2 – 4 , is that it is possible to de - velop quantitative estimates for the protein - induced bilayer deformation energy , which in turn allows for predictions regarding how a membrane’s lipid bilayer component will reg - ulate the function of bilayer - spanning pro - teins . Even when applied to proteins with complex geometries , Equations 2 – 4 , although approximate , should apply generally and al - low for the prediction of complex changes in membrane protein function . Future challenges will be to develop a con - tinuum model of elastic bilayer deformation that includes bilayer compression , monolayer bending , and acyl chain tilt ; to go beyond the continuum models and develop semimicro - scopic descriptions that still allow for fairly straightforward estimates of the bilayer defor - mation energy ; to understand better the en - ergetic consequences of the local lipid pack - ing around integral membrane proteins ; and to incorporate more speciﬁc lipid - protein interactions .
