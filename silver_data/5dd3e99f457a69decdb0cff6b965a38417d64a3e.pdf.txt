It is present at the NH2 - terminus of proteins that often contain consensus sequences for binding to clathrin coat components and their accessory factors , and therefore function as endocytic adaptors . ENTH domain containing proteins have additional roles in signaling and actin regulation and may have yet other actions in the nucleus . The ENTH domain is structurally similar to the VHS domain . These domains define two families of adaptor proteins which function in membrane traffic and whose interaction with membranes is regulated , in part , by phosphoinositides .

Introduction Following the discovery of the clathrin coat in the mid - sixties [ 1 ] major progress has been made towards its molecular characterization . Endocytic clathrin coats , in particular , have been thoroughly investigated [ 2 ^ 5 ] . Their main components are the heavy and light chains of clathrin [ 4 ] , and the hetero - tetrameric clathrin adaptor AP - 2 [ 6 ] . In addition , a large num - ber of accessory factors that cooperate with clathrin and AP - 2 in the endocytic reaction , and may also assist the newly formed vesicle during the early stages of the endocytic path - way , have been identi¢ed [ 3 , 7 ] . Studies of these factors , which typically have a modular structure , led to the identi¢cation of the EH domain , and subsequently , of the ENTH domain . EH domains , which are discussed elsewhere in this volume [ 8 ] , are small protein modules ¢rst recognized in the NH2 - terminal region of Eps15 ( Eps15 homology ) . Eps15 is a main substrate for the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor [ 9 ] and is also a major AP - 2 interactor [ 10 ] . Thus , while it has a special role in EGF receptor signaling and / or internalization , it also participates in all forms of endocytosis , including synaptic vesicle recycling at the synapse [ 11 ] . Studies of the EH domain revealed that it functions as a protein ^ protein interaction module and de¢ned the sequence NPF as a critical consensus for EH domain binding [ 12 ] . 2 . Epsin : the founding member of ENTH domain containing proteins A search for interactors of the EH domains of Eps15 in brain led to the identi¢cation of a major 90 kDa synaptically enriched protein band ( based on SDS ^ PAGE motility ) re - ferred to as epsin ( epsin 1 ) ( for Eps15 interacting protein ) [ 13 ] . A molecular characterization of epsin demonstrated its identity to a 90 kDa protein band previously shown to bind the ear domain of the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 [ 14 ] , thus cor - roborating a link of this protein to the endocytic machinery . Independently , epsin was isolated as an interactor of the EH domains of intersectin , another accessory factor in endocyto - sis [ 15 , 16 ] and of POB1 , a component of the Ral GTPase network [ 17 ] . A function of epsin in the endocytic reaction was further con¢rmed by its property to bind clathrin [ 18 ^ 20 ] and by evidence that disruption of epsin function in living cells inhibits receptor - mediated endocytosis of the EGF and transferrin receptors [ 13 ] . 3 . Domain structure of epsin and de¢nition of the ENTH domain Inspection of the epsin 1 sequence and alignment with re - lated sequences allowed de¢nition of several major domains within this protein [ 13 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . The NH2 - terminal approxi - mately 150 amino acids are highly conserved in evolution . Hence , they were proposed to represent a separately folded protein module , the epsin NH2 - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain [ 13 , 21 ] . The remaining portion of the epsin contains several stretches of low complexity amino acid composition and signature motifs for binding to other endocytic proteins . Its central region contains multiple DPW repeats [ 13 ] , which ¢t the consensus DP [ W / F ] of the core of binding sites for the ear domains of the K - and L - adaptin subunits of AP - 2 [ 22 ] . It also includes two consensus sequences for binding to the heavy chain of clathrin ( clathrin boxes ) [ 4 , 18 , 20 , 23 ] . Accord - ingly , the central region of epsin binds both AP - 2 and clathrin [ 18 , 20 ] . The COOH - terminal part of the protein comprises 0014 - 5793 / 02 / $ 22 . 00 (cid:223) 2002 Federation of European Biochemical Societies . Published by Elsevier Science B . V .

Re - cently , epsin was shown to be mono - ubiquitinated ( Polo , S . , Sigismund , S . , Faretta , M . , Guidi , M . , Capua , R . M . , Bossi , G . , Chen , H . , De Camilli , P . and Di Fiore , P . P . , unpublished observation ) and the sequence between the ENTH domain and the central DPW domain was found to contain three ubiquitin interacting motifs ( UIMs ) [ 24 ] . This region does bind ubiquitin , and , surprisingly , is also needed for ubiquiti - nation ( Polo et al . , see above ) . At least some of the interactions of epsin are regulated by phosphorylation . At synapses , epsin undergoes constitutive phosphorylation and its stimulation - dependent dephosphory - lation correlates with its assembly into endocytic complexes [ 25 ] . Mitotic phosphorylation of epsin at serine 382 ( rat epsin 1 ) inhibits its interaction with clathrin coat components and possibly re£ects one of the mechanisms leading to inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in mitotic cells [ 25 , 26 ] . Stud - ies on yeast epsin homologs [ 27 ] predict that epsin may be a substrate for GAK kinases [ 28 ] , the mammalian homologs of yeast Prk / Ark kinases implicated in actin function and endo - cytosis [ 29 ] . 4 . The epsin family Proteins that have the same overall domain structure of epsin 1 and contain most of its signature motifs are present in all eukaryotic organisms ( Fig . 1 ) .

While only DPF / W motifs ( AP - 2 interaction motifs ) are shown , additional DXF motifs , which may also mediate in - teraction with AP - 2 , are present in some of these proteins . Orange ovals represent either sequences which ¢ts the clathrin binding consensus ( clathrin box ) as de¢ned in [ 4 , 23 ] , or closely related sequences experimentally shown to bind clathrin .

Mammalian AP180 was shown to bind clathrin through a series of short motifs more distantly related to typical clathrin boxes ( region indicated by an orange dotted line ) [ 37 ] . HIP1R binds clathrin via coiled - coil in - teractions ( region indicated by an orange continuous line ) ( modi¢ed from [ 21 ] ) . FEBS 25686 21 - 2 - 02 Cyaan Magenta Geel Zwart P .

Epsin 1 is expressed at high concentration in brain [ 13 ] , epsin 2 has a more widespread tissue distribution [ 20 ] while epsin 3 is keratinocyte speci¢c [ 30 ] . A Xenopus epsin was identi¢ed as a mitotic phosphopro - tein in oocytes ( MP90 ) [ 26 ] . One epsin orthologue , liquid fac - ets ( LqF ) , is present in Drosophila . Developmental defects due to mutations in LqF are enhanced by mutations in the genes encoding clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) or the GTPase dynamin ( shibire ) , thus providing genetic evidence for a link between epsin family members and endocytosis [ 31 ] . Two characterized epsin homologs , Ent1 and Ent1 , are present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . In these two proteins , the clathrin binding consen - Fig . 2 .

Both Ent1 and Ent2 participate in endocytosis and in the regulation of actin function , in agreement with strong evi - dence linking actin to endocytosis in yeast . While neither the ENT1 or the ENT2 gene is essential , an ent1 v , ent2 v dou - ble mutant is not viable . This mutant can be rescued by a truncated form of Ent2 that comprises the ENTH domain and the COOH - terminal clathrin binding domain , but not by Ent2 constructs missing the ENTH domain [ 32 ] . Thus , the ENTH domain represents a critically important portion of epsin . 5 . Other ENTH domain containing proteins In addition to proteins likely to be bona ¢de epsin homo - logs , several other protein families contain an ENTH domain ( http : / / www . sanger . ac . uk / cgi - bin / Pfam / getacc ? PF01417 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . While some of these proteins are substantially divergent from epsin outside this domain , which is always localized near the NH2 - terminus , they often contain some additional ele - ments of similarity . Thus , many such proteins contain UIMs , DX [ W , F ] motifs [ 3 ] , clathrin boxes or closely related sequences , and NPF motifs [ 21 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . For two of these protein families , the presence of an ENTH domain , predicted by distant amino acid sequence similarity , has been con¢rmed by crystallographic studies . One of these two families is the AP180 / CALM family of accessory clathrin adaptors . AP180 is a third major component of neuronal endocytic clathrin coats besides clathrin and AP - 2 [ 33 ^ 35 ] . CALM is its non - neuronal homolog [ 36 ] . Both AP180 and CALM bind AP - 2 and clath - rin . Accordingly , they contain AP - 2 binding motifs [ 3 ] as well as multiple repeats of a small amino acid stretch that contains a core consensus similar to clathrin boxes [ 37 ] . CALM also contains NPF motifs and bind EH domain containing pro - teins [ 36 ] . Based on results from cell - free studies [ 34 ] and on ultrastructural observations of AP180 mutants of Drosophila ( lap mutants ) and Caenorhabditis elegans ( unc11 mutants ) [ 38 , 39 ] , AP180 / CALM proteins are thought to play a role in the generation of homogeneously sized high curvature vesicles . Furthermore , unc11 mutants accumulate abnormal levels of synaptobrevin / VAMP in the plasma membrane [ 39 ] , raising the possibility that AP180 may participate in the recapture of synaptobrevin into endocytic vesicles after endocytosis . Two ENTH containing AP180 homologs are present in yeast : yAP180A and yAP180B . They bind clathrin and EH domain containing proteins and have a putative role in endocytosis and actin function [ 40 ] . The other protein family with an NH2 - terminal region that is structurally similar to the ENTH domain is the one com - prising HIP1 and HIP1R , so called because of their property to interact with huntingtin ( huntingtin interacting protein and huntingtin interacting protein related , respectively ) , the Hun - tington disease protein . HIP1 binds AP - 2 and clathrin via typical consensus sequences ( DPF or DXF and a clathrin box respectively ) [ 41 ^ 43 ] , and both HIP1 and HIP1R interact with clathrin via coiled - coil domains [ 42 , 44 ] . A unique feature of HIP1 and HIP1R among ENTH domain containing pro - teins is the presence of a talin homology domain in the COOH - terminal region [ 45 ] . This comprises the I / LWEQ mo - tif through which they bind actin . Thus , these two proteins , which are partially localized on clathrin - coated pits and vesicles , may act as linkers between clathrin coats and the actin cytoskeleton [ 44 , 45 ] . The yeast homolog of HIP1 / HIP1R is the Sla2 protein , which also contains an ENTH domain and a talin homology domain , and which is impli - cated in actin function and endocytosis [ 46 , 47 ] 6 . Atomic structure of the ENTH domain The structure of the ENTH domain of epsin 1 was solved by X - ray crystallography ( Fig . 2 ) . The ENTH domain forms a compact globular structure , composed of eight K - helices con - nected by loops of varying length ( [ 48 ] ; see also RCSB / PDB accession number 1EDU ) . The general topology of the do - main is determined by three helical hairpins that are stacked consecutively with a right - handed twist . This stacking gives the ENTH domain a rectangular appearance when viewed face on [ 48 ] . The most highly conserved amino acids fall roughly into two classes : ( i ) internal residues that are involved in packing and therefore are necessary for structural integrity , and ( ii ) solvent accessible residues that may be involved in protein ^ protein interactions [ 48 ] . More recently , other ENTH domain structures have been solved : the ENTH domain of rat CALM [ 49 ] ( Figs . 2d and 3 ) , of its Drosophila homolog Lap ( Fig . 2e ) [ 50 ] and of Hip1R ( McMahon , H . , personal communication ) . These ENTH do - mains are very similar to each other in spite of low amino acid sequence similarity ( Fig . 2d , e ) . Only the COOH - terminal helix of epsin’s ENTH domain does not superimpose well on the corresponding region of CALM , but this di¡erence may re - £ect an abnormal orientation of this helix when disconnected from downstream regions . In the CALM construct used for crystallographic analysis , this helix is followed by an addi - tional K - helical stretch [ 49 ] . 7 . Structural neighbors of the ENTH domain The ENTH domain is most similar in atomic structure to the VHS domain [ 51 ^ 53 ] ( Fig . 2a ) . The VHS and ENTH domains align with a root mean square deviation ( RMSD ) of approximately 1 . 8 A(cid:238) , indicating an extremely similar fold despite low primary sequence similarity . The VHS domain , which is discussed in another paper of this volume [ 54 ] was ¢rst identi¢ed as an NH2 - terminal homology region found in Vps27 , Hrs and STAM [ 51 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . Hrs and its yeast homo - log Vps27 have been implicated in endocytic tra⁄c . STAM is a signal transducing adaptor molecule involved in cytokine - mediated signaling [ 55 ] . The VHS domain is also present in other mammalian proteins that participate in the regulation of membrane tra⁄c to the endosome - lysosomal system either from the plasma membrane or from the Golgi complex . These include EAST , which , like Hrs , is a substrate for EGFR and also binds to Eps15 [ 56 ^ 58 ] , and the GGA proteins , which function in transport from the Golgi to the lysosomes [ 59 ^ 61 ] . As in the case of ENTH domain proteins , functional links of VHS domain proteins to actin and signaling have been reported [ 51 , 54 ] . Like the ENTH domain , the VHS domain is always found at the NH2 - terminus of proteins and can be followed by UIM motifs [ 24 ] . In addition , some VHS and ENTH domain proteins share some of their binding partners ( for example Eps15 and clathrin ) [ 58 , 62 , 63 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . The ENTH structure is also similar to an armadillo repeat segment of L - catenin ( Fig . 2b ) [ 64 ] , to the HEAT repeat unit FEBS 25686 21 - 2 - 02 Cyaan Magenta Geel Zwart P . De Camilli et al . / FEBS Letters 513 ( 2002 ) 11 ^ 18 14 of karyopherin - L ( importin - L ) ( Fig . 2c ) [ 65 , 66 ] , and to the sca¡olding subunit of protein phosphatase 2A [ 67 ] . Both ar - madillo and HEAT repeats are protein ^ protein interaction modules composed exclusively of K - helices , and form struc - tures with two primary faces , one concave and one convex . Armadillo and HEAT repeats bind to target proteins with their concave face [ 64 ^ 67 ] . Structural superimposition of the ENTH domain with either type of repeats aligns their concave faces , which contain the largest patch of conserved surface residues . 8 . Interactions of the ENTH domain The ENTH domain of AP180 / CALM contains a basic ami - no acid cluster that was shown biochemically to bind inosi - tolpolyphosphates as well as PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 49 , 68 ] . The liga - tion of three lysines and a histidine within this cluster by phosphate groups of the inositol ring has been con¢rmed by crystallographic studies [ 49 ] ( Fig . 3A ) . Surprisingly , the ENTH domain of epsin , which lacks this basic region [ 49 ] , also binds PIP2 and PIP3 [ 69 ] . The residues of this domain that exhibit the largest chemical shift upon phospholipid bind - ing are not in register with the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding amino acids of AP180 / CALM , but are on the same side of the do - main ( Fig . 3B ) . Although some discrepancies between the two studies which addressed these lipid interactions must be fur - ther addressed [ 49 , 69 ] , it would appear that the ENTH do - mains are phospholipid binding modules , whose a⁄nity for phosphoinositides is further enriched in some family members by the presence of clusters of basic amino acids . The interac - tion with membrane phospholipids of ENTH domains must be reversible and regulated because a major pool of these proteins has a cytosolic localization [ 13 , 20 ] . We note that an interaction with phosphoinositides was also shown for the NH2 - terminal region of the K - adaptin subunit of AP - 2 [ 70 ] , which was proposed to align structurally with the NH2 - termi - nal portion of the ENTH domain of AP180 / CALM ( see Fig . 2G in [ 49 ] ) . Thus , recruitment to the lipid bilayer of the clath - rin adaptor AP - 2 and of ENTH domain proteins may be mediated by similar mechanisms . Interestingly , the structur - ally related VHS domain is also a phospholipid binding mod - ule , whose interaction with membrane is further enhanced , at least in some proteins , by £anking FYVE domains which bind PtdIns ( 3 ) P ( Fig . 1 ) [ 51 ^ 53 ] . Interactions of ENTH domains with proteins have been described . The interaction of the ENTH domain of epsin 1 with the transcription factor PLZF may suggest a role of epsin as a transcriptional regulator ( see below ) [ 48 ] . The same domain also strongly interacts with tubulin in vitro ( Kay , B . , McPherson , P . and Traub , L . , personal communi - cations ; our unpublished results ) and possibly with the coat - omer [ 48 ] , but the signi¢cance of these ¢ndings is unknown . No interactions with transmembrane proteins have been re - ported so far . However , the reported binding of the VHS domain to cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins [ 60 , 61 ] raises the possibility that a similar property may also apply to the ENTH domain . 9 . ENTH domain proteins and ubiquitin An unexpected twist in the understanding of epsin function came with the isolation of Drosophila epsin ( LqF , see above ) as an enhancer of mutations in Fat facet ( Faf ) [ 31 ] . Faf is a de - ubiquitinating enzyme whose activity is necessary in a sig - naling pathway underlying the proper development of photo - receptor cell clusters in the eye . Genetic data suggest that epsin may be a substrate for Faf [ 31 ] . Accordingly , epsin has now been shown to be mono - ubiquitinated and its state of ubiquitination is stimulated by growth factor receptor ac - tivation ( Polo et al . , see above ) . It remains unclear whether ubiquitination ^ de - ubiquitination of epsin is a mechanism to control its half - life , or to regulate its interactions and local - ization . Since ubiquitination of membrane associated proteins mediate their targeting to lysosomes , ubiquitination may Fig . 3 . Proposed PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding sites in the ENTH domain .

De Camilli et al . / FEBS Letters 513 ( 2002 ) 11 ^ 18 15 underlie a post - internalization function of epsin in the endo - cytic pathway [ 71 , 72 ] . A further link between epsin and ubiq - uitin metabolism has been revealed by the identi¢cation of UIMs in epsin and other ENTH and VHS domain containing proteins [ 24 ] and by the demonstration that the UIMs of epsin bind ubiquitin ( Polo et al . , see above ) . 10 . Nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling of ENTH domain proteins Epsin and other well - characterized ENTH domain contain - ing proteins are localized at the cell periphery , in proximity of endocytic sites , actin and signaling sca¡olds [ 13 , 44 , 45 , 49 ] . Yet , incubation of cells with leptomycin , a fungal metabolite that inhibits the Crm1 - dependent nuclear export pathway , leads to the rapid accumulation of both epsin and CALM in the nu - cleus , suggesting that these ENTH domain containing pro - teins continuously shuttle in and out of the nuclear envelope [ 48 , 73 ] . A similar shuttling , involving a reversible binding to Ran GTPases , has been demonstrated for Eps15 [ 73 ] . Epsin does not contain a conventional nuclear localization sequence , but it is interesting to note that its ENTH domain shares some similarity to the karyopherin / importins ( see above ) ( Fig . 2c ) . Furthermore , L - catenin , another structural neighbor of the ENTH domain ( Fig . 2b ) and of karyopherin , also shuttles in and out of the nucleus but lacks a classical nuclear localization sequence . The list of proteins with a main func - tion in the cortical region of the cell , but which also have a second life in the nucleus as transcriptional regulators , is rap - idly increasing ( for example [ 74 ^ 77 ] ) . They include actin [ 78 ] and proteins that , like epsin , can bind both plasma membrane phospholipids and transcription factors . One well - character - ized such example is tubby [ 79 ] . Perhaps , this dual localization re£ects an origin of the nuclear matrix from a prokaryotic cortical cytoskeleton that acts as a sca¡old for DNA . In eu - karyotic cells , where the DNA has been segregated from the cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope , nuclear cytoplasmic shut - tling of proteins of the cell cortex may play an important role in mediating a signaling feed - back between the transcriptional machinery and changes in the extracellular environment . 11 . Putative adaptor function of ENTH domain containing proteins Based on their structural properties and interaction , as well as on the phenotype resulting from their functional disrup - tion , it appears that a main function of the majority of ENTH domain containing proteins is to act as accessory clathrin adaptors in endocytosis ( Fig . 4 ) . Thus , they bind to the phospholipid bilayer , and help recruiting clathrin coat components and EH domain containing clathrin accessory factors , such as Eps15 and intersectin . Consistent with this hypothesis , AP180 and CALM are enriched in clathrin - coated vesicles [ 13 , 33 ] and disruption of AP180 at the synapse leads to defects in the clathrin - dependent endocytosis of synaptic vesicles . An accumulation at clathrin - coated pits was also ob - served for epsin [ 13 , 20 ] , HIP1 [ 41 ] and HIP1R [ 44 ] , although the recovery if these proteins in puri¢ed clathrin - coated vesicle fractions is variable [ 13 , 80 ] , possibly depending , in part , upon the variable preservation of phosphoinositides on the vesicle membrane . A similar clathrin adaptor function has been dem - onstrated for one class of VHS domain proteins , the GGA proteins , which comprise an adaptin homology region and clathrin binding sites . The VHS domain of the GGA proteins not only binds phospholipids but also cytoplasmic tails of vesicle cargo proteins , thus participating in cargo selection [ 60 , 61 ] . An interesting possibility , to be explored by future studies , is that ENTH domains as well may interact with the cytosolic tail of membrane proteins and thus contribute to the sorting of cargo transmembrane proteins into budding vesicles . Via interactions with clathrin accessory factors such as Eps15 , intersectin and POB1 , ENTH domain proteins may help to coordinate the endocytic reaction with a local reor - ganization of the actin cytoskeleton and of signaling sca¡olds . Mono - ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tails of several membrane proteins has been shown to be important for their internalization [ 81 ] . UIMs may interact with their ubiquiti - nated tails and thus contribute both to the selection of these proteins as cargo for the nascent vesicle and to the recruit - ment of ENTH domain containing proteins to the membrane ( Fig . 4 ) . An additional function of UIMs may be to bind ubiquitin - loaded E3 enzymes , thus facilitating the ubiquitina - tion of ENTH domain proteins ( Polo et al . , see above ) . Sup - port to the second possibility comes from essential require - ment for the UIMs in the mono - ubiquitination of epsin and of other UIM domain containing proteins tested ( Eps15 and Hrs ) ( Polo et al . , see above ) . In either case , presence of ubiq - uitinated ENTH domain proteins on internalized vesicles may help to direct them to the endosome - lysosomal system [ 71 , 72 ] . UIMs are also present in VHS domain containing proteins , which may additionally contain the FYVE domain , a PtdIns ( 3 ) P binding module ( see Stenmark et al . [ 63 ] ) . Thus , phosphoinositides and membrane - bound ubiquitin may func - Fig . 4 . Interactions of epsin illustrating its putative adaptor function . The ‘so called’ DPW domain include both DPW repeats and two clathrin boxes [ 20 ] . While the interaction of epsin’s UIM domain with ubiquitin has been documented ( Polo et al . , see text ) , it remains unclear whether epsin does bind ubiquitinated protein cargo of clathrin - coated vesicles . It is also unclear whether the ubiquitination of epsin , which requires an intact UIM , interferes with the ubiquitin binding properties of the UIM . U = ubiquitin .

While the predominant phospho - inositide on the plasma membrane and nascent endocytic vesicles is PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , an important phosphoinositide on endosomes is PtdIns ( 3 ) P . It is therefore of interest that ENTH domain containing proteins appear to be involved in the endocytic reaction , while Hrs , which contains a VHS do - main followed by the FYVE domain is implicated in down - stream stations of the endocytic pathway . A progressive shift from an ENTH - based membrane associated sca¡old to a VHS - FYVE domain - based sca¡old may occur along the en - docytic pathway . 12 . Conclusions and future perspectives ENTH domain containing proteins have come to center stage in cell biology as important cross - roads of many di¡er - ent areas of cell biology . The ENTH domain is a membrane interacting module which is found in a variety of proteins whose shared characteristic is to act at early stages of the endocytic pathway as coat components and coat adaptors . These proteins have additional roles in signaling and actin regulation . Their further characterization may help shed light on the elusive link between actin and endocytosis . Priorities for future research include a precise elucidation of the link of ENTH domain containing proteins to ubiquitin metabolism and an understanding of how the multiple interactions of these proteins are regulated . A well - coordinated sequence of conformational changes and posttranslational modi¢cation is likely to be essential for a proper function of these proteins in the context of the cell cytoplasm .
