To investigate human exposure to live poultry and changes in risk perception and behavior after the April 2013 influenza A ( H7N9 ) outbreak in China , we surveyed 2 , 504 urban residents in 5 cities and 1 , 227 rural residents in 4 provinces and found that perceived risk for influenza A ( H7N9 ) was low . The highest rate of exposure to live poul - try was reported in Guangzhou , where 47 % of those sur - veyed reported visiting a live poultry market > 1 times in the previous year . Most ( 77 % ) urban respondents reported that they visited live markets less often after influenza A ( H7N9 ) cases were first identified in China in March 2013 , but only 30 % supported permanent closure of the markets to control the epidemic . In rural areas , 48 % of respondents reported that they raised backyard poultry . Exposure to live commer - cial and private poultry is common in urban and rural China and remains a potential risk factor for human infection with novel influenza viruses . T he novel influenza A ( H7N9 ) virus was identified in early 2013 ; as of March 31 , 2014 , a total of 404 lab - oratory - confirmed cases of human infection had been re - ported . These cases included 394 in mainland China , 2 in Taiwan , 7 in Hong Kong , and 1 in Malaysia ( 1 , 2 ) . Only 2 laboratory - confirmed cases were identified in the sum - mer months ( June – September 2013 ) , but beginning in early October 2013 , the virus reemerged and caused many new human infections ( 3 , 4 ) . Previously published studies have reported that most human infections appear to have occurred as a result of exposure to live poultry , particularly through visits to live poultry markets ( LPMs ) in urban areas ( 3 , 5 – 8 ) . No pub - lished reports have detailed population exposure to live poultry and LPMs in influenza A ( H7N9 ) virus – affected areas in China , and few data on live poultry exposure have been previously reported in areas in which the virus has not been detected ( 4 , 9 , 10 ) . In addition , little information has been reported on how the population of China responded to the outbreak and the control measures that were imple - mented . To clarify responses to the influenza A ( H7N9 ) outbreak in China , we investigated patterns in human ex - posure to live poultry in LPMs and at home , examined risk perception and behavioral responses in the population , and compared these parameters between urban and rural areas in China that were affected or unaffected by the virus . Methods Study Design We collected information on human exposure to poul - try , risk perception and psychological responses to the outbreak , preventive behaviors , and attitudes toward con - trol measures , including closure of LPMs . We used 2 ap - proaches to collect these data . In urban areas , we conducted telephone surveys because access to mobile telephones is high , making the approach feasible . In rural areas , where telephone accessibility is lower , we conducted door - to - door surveys . We selected 5 large cities for our study to represent di - verse levels of socioeconomic development and geograph - ic location : Chengdu , Guangzhou , Shanghai , Shenyang , and Wuhan ( Figure 1 ) .

Human Exposure to Live Poultry and Responses to Influenza confirmed human cases of influenza A ( H7N9 ) had been reported in these cities except Shanghai ; 1 environmental sample had tested positive for the virus in Guangzhou ( 11 ) . In each city , we aimed to interview > 500 adult residents ( > 18 years of age ) who had been living there for > 1 year . The tele - phone surveys were conducted by using a computer - assisted interviewing system , which enabled random generation of mobile telephone numbers and systematic data collection across each city . On each call , after the study was explained and verbal consent obtained , the respondent would be re - cruited into the study and asked to complete the survey . If a respondent were busy , a call would be made later , when the respondent was available to finish the questionnaire . Unan - swered numbers were given 4 follow - up calls , made at dif - ferent hours and on different days of the week , before being classified as invalid . The online Technical Appendix shows the survey used in English and Chinese ( http : / / wwwnc . cdc . gov / EID / article / 20 / 8 / 13 - 1821 - Techapp1 . pdf ) . Although we had planned to use the same telephone survey approach in rural areas , a pilot study revealed it was not feasible because the survey would occur during the busy farming season , when residents would not be readily available by telephone . Instead , in rural areas we conducted door - to - door surveys . In mainland China , some cities / coun - ties that are administrated as rural regions actually include semiurban areas , such as towns in a county , and rural areas , such as villages in a town / county . The living conditions and lifestyle of residents in semiurban areas are similar to those of urban residents , whereas residents in rural areas live in a different environment , with low population den - sity and a more self - sustainable life , mainly dependent on farming . We used convenience sampling to choose 4 coun - ties from rural rather than semiurban areas . Rural sites were selected on the basis of the level of economic development ( measured by gross domestic product per capita ) and the overall incidence of infectious diseases in 2012 . Given the tiers of administration levels in mainland China , including province , city , county , town , and village , we selected a city from each of the 4 provinces with mid - level gross domestic product per capita compared with other cities in the prov - ince and with an incidence of notifiable infectious diseases above the provincial average . Within each province , we then selected a rural county from each of the 4 cities areas . As a result , we chose Dawa County ( Panjin city , Liaoning Province ) , Zijin County ( Heyuan city , Guangdong Prov - ince ) , Nanzhang County ( Xiangfan city , Hubei Province ) , and Pengxi County ( Suining city , Sichuan Province ) for the study ( Figure 1 ) . At time of the survey , none of these coun - ties had laboratory - confirmed human infections with avian influenza A ( H7N9 ) virus .

Black dots indicate geographic locations of laboratory - confirmed cases of H7N9 through October 31 , 2013 . Shading indicates population density ( persons per square kilometer ) . The 5 selected urban locations were Chengdu , capital of Sichuan Province in western China , population 10 million ; Guangzhou , capital of Guangdong Province in southern China , population 13 million ; Shanghai , a municipality in eastern China , population 23 million ; Shenyang , capital of Liaoning Province in northeastern China , population 8 million ; and Wuhan , capital of Hubei Province in central China , population 10 million . The 4 rural areas were Dawa County ( Panjin city , Liaoning Province ) , Zijin County ( Heyuan city , Guangdong Province ) , Nanzhang County ( Xiangfan city , Hubei Province ) , and Pengxi County ( Suining city , Sichuan Province ) . RESEARCH After the initial selections , all towns within a county were stratified into high , middle , and low levels of socioeco - nomic status on the basis of census data ( 12 – 15 ) , and 1 town was selected at random within each strata . Then , 2 villages were selected at random within each town , a convenience sample of 50 households was recruited in each village , and 1 adult in each household ( > 18 years of age and resident in the village for > 1 year ) was interviewed . To improve coopera - tion , each rural interviewee received a small gift worth ≈10 Chinese renminbi ( 6 . 1 renminbi = $ 1 US ) , such as a towel or a bottle of shampoo , after the survey was completed . All selected participants in the rural areas consented to be inter - viewed during the survey . The time taken to complete the survey was 16 minutes on average for each participant . The urban surveys were conducted in May and June 2013 and the rural surveys in July and August 2013 . Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention before the survey was conducted . Survey Instrument All surveys in urban and rural areas were conducted by using the same questionnaire , which was based on an instrument used during the outbreaks of severe acute re - spiratory syndrome ( SARS ) in 2003 ( 16 , 17 ) and influenza A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 in 2009 ( 18 ) . The survey instrument was pretested for face and content validity , length , and com - prehensibility . Most answers were ranked on ordinal Likert scales . We used the State Trait Anxiety Inventory to mea - sure the general level of anxiety in the population ( 16 – 18 ) . We investigated exposure to live poultry in backyards and in LPMs , which are defined as markets where the pub - lic can buy live chickens , ducks , pigeons , and other birds . Because LPMs are rare in rural areas and rural residents seldom visit LPMs , we did not ask rural respondents about exposures to live poultry in LPMs , only about backyard poultry exposure . In urban areas , we asked respondents about frequency of visits to LPMs and behaviors in LPMs ( i . e . , frequency of purchases , practice of picking up birds before purchasing , location where purchased live poultry were slaughtered ) . We asked all respondents about percep - tion of risk for influenza A ( H7N9 ) infection and perceived severity of such an infection , preventive practices in gen - eral and specifically in response to influenza A ( H7N9 ) , and attitudes toward influenza A ( H7N9 ) and closure of LPMs . Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were conducted in R version 2 . 13 . 0 ( R Foundation for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) . We performed descriptive analyses of responses in each location and compared responses between urban areas with and without laboratory - confirmed cases of influenza A ( H7N9 ) by using χ 2 tests . For the subset of respondents who reported purchasing live poultry in LPMs during the previous year , we used a multivariate logistic regression model to estimate the associations of age , sex , educational level , and geographic location with attitudes toward clo - sure of LPMs and changes in habits of buying live poultry after public health authorities announced the first human influenza A ( H7N9 ) case on March 31 , 2013 ( 19 ) . The sam - ple size of 500 respondents in each city and 300 respon - dents in each rural county was chosen to ensure precision of answers to within ±4 % and ±6 % , respectively , and to ensure reasonable statistical power to identify differences in responses of 5 % – 10 % or more between locations . 1298 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www . cdc . gov / eid • Vol . 20 , No . 8 , August 2014 Figure 2 .

CATI , computer - assisted telephone interview ; SES , socioeconomic status . Human Exposure to Live Poultry and Responses to Influenza Results In the 5 urban areas , 81 , 266 unique telephone numbers were dialed , and the overall response rate was 8 % ( num - ber of participants [ 2 , 504 ] divided by number of calls with eligible respondents [ 29 , 919 ] ) ( Figure 2 , panel A ) . The se - lection of 1 , 227 participants in 4 rural sites is illustrated in Figure 2 , panel B . The surveys were conducted from May 23 through August 24 . During this period , the influenza A ( H7N9 ) epidemic had passed its peak , and few cases oc - curred . Guangdong Province notified its first human influ - enza A ( H7N9 ) case on August 9 , after the completion of the survey in Guangzhou on June 26 . Respondents in urban areas tended to have white - collar jobs or were unemployed , were younger , had more educa - tion and higher income , and were less likely to be married than those in rural areas ( Table 1 ) . However , because the surveys were conducted in different forms in urban versus rural areas and the general characteristics of participants were different , including the risk for becoming infected with influenza A ( H7N9 ) virus and the types of potential exposure to avian influenza viruses , we did not make any further direct quantitative comparisons between urban and rural respondents . For comparisons among urban areas , respondents were generally similar , but reported incomes were higher for Shanghai and Guangzhou than for the other 3 cities ( data not shown ) . We assessed exposures to live poultry and visits to LPMs in the 5 cities . In total , 33 % of respondents reported visiting LPMs during the preceding year , the highest pro - portion in Guangzhou ; notable differences were found be - tween cities ( Table 2 ) . By imputing midpoints of report - ed purchasing rates , we estimated that the mean number of live poultry purchased per year varied between cities : 6 . 8 for Shenyang , 19 for Shanghai , 20 for Wuhan , 28 for Chengdu , and 47 for Guangzhou . Age - specific patterns in exposure to live poultry were generally similar for men and women within each city , with some exceptions . In Guang - zhou , women 35 – 54 years of age purchased poultry in LPMs much more frequently than did men of the same age , but the reverse was true for those > 65 years of age ( Fig - ure 3 ) . We found no evidence of a substantial difference in poultry exposures by sex in Shanghai ( Figure 3 ) . We further analyzed exposures in LPMs among urban residents on the basis of responses from the 829 ( 33 % ) of Emerging Infectious Diseases • www . cdc . gov / eid • Vol . 20 , No . 8 , August 2014 1299 Table 1 .

RESEARCH 2 , 504 participants who visited LPMs > 1 time in the preced - ing year . Overall , 69 % of these respondents reported that they always visited the nearest LPM ; median distance from home to the nearest LPM was 1 km . Most respondents re - ported that they “usually” or “always” picked up poultry for examination before deciding to buy , with the highest proportion in Chengdu and lowest in Shenyang ; 87 % of re - spondents always arranged for slaughter of purchased poul - try in the LPM , with no notable differences between cities . During the study period , the general anxiety level among urban respondents ( measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory ) was low to moderate , but levels varied substantially between cities ; the lowest mean scores were seen in Wuhan and Shenyang ( Table 3 ) . Perceived risk for influenza A ( H7N9 ) in the following month ( absolute sus - ceptibility ) and relative to others ( relative susceptibility ) were generally low in all cities , but highest in Shanghai . Respondents in Shanghai and Guangzhou were more likely to respond that they would be more worried than usual if they experienced an influenza - like illness ( ILI ) . Twelve percent of respondents reported that they had worried about becoming ill with influenza A ( H7N9 ) during the previous week ; levels varied among cities , with a greater frequency of worry in Shanghai and Guangzhou ( Table 3 ) . Respon - dents in Shenyang reported the highest perceived severity of influenza A ( H7N9 ) compared with seasonal influenza and avian influenza A ( H5N1 ) ; respondents in Guang - zhou reported the highest perceived severity of influenza A ( H7N9 ) compared with that of SARS ( Table 3 ) .

Human Exposure to Live Poultry and Responses to Influenza poultry at home . Overall , 47 % reported raising chickens , 15 % raised ducks , and 8 % raised geese ; these proportions varied between counties ( Table 4 ) . In rural areas , levels of perceived absolute and relative susceptibility and concern about ILI or confirmed influenza A ( H7N9 ) infection were generally low ; some differences were seen between the 4 rural areas . Respondents in Nanzhang and Zijin were more likely to respond that they would be more worried than usu - al if they had an ILI ; 24 % of respondents in Zijin reported that they had worried about becoming ill with influenza A ( H7N9 ) in the previous week , and the average level of worry in Zijin was higher than that for other counties ( Ta - ble 4 ) . Most respondents in each area perceived influenza A ( H7N9 ) to be more severe than seasonal influenza but less severe than influenza A ( H5N1 ) and SARS . Among respondents in urban areas who visited LPMs > 1 time in the preceding year , 77 % reported that they had stopped buying or bought lower amounts of live poultry since March 2013 ; this proportion was highest ( 91 % ) for Shanghai ( Table 2 ) . We examined factors affecting the likelihood of changing habits of buying live poultry and found greater changes among women , those with higher educational attainment , and those residing in Shanghai and Wuhan rather than in Chengdu . We found no statistically significant differences by age group ( Table 5 ) . On average , across the 5 cities , 30 % of respondents re - ported that they would support the closure of LPMs to con - trol the epidemic ; the proportion in support of closures was highest in Shanghai ( 39 % ) and lowest in Guangzhou ( 27 % ) and Chengdu ( 25 % ) ( Table 2 ) . We examined factors affect - ing the likelihood of supporting the closure of LPMs and found greater support among persons 55 – 64 years of age ( odds ratio [ OR ] 3 . 28 , 95 % CI 1 . 71 – 6 . 29 ) and > 65 years of age ( OR 2 . 36 , 95 % CI 1 . 04 – 5 . 32 ) . We also found greater support for closure of LPMs in Shanghai ( OR 1 . 77 , 95 % CI 1 . 05 – 2 . 99 ) than in Chengdu but no significant differ - ences by sex or educational attainment ( Table 5 ) . However , 32 % of respondents in Shanghai reported that the closure of LPMs had caused them inconvenience . Discussion We have reported empirical information on human exposures to live poultry , perception of risk for influenza A ( H7N9 ) , and behavioral responses to the 2013 influenza A ( H7N9 ) outbreak in China . We found that exposure to LPMs in urban areas is common : 20 % – 50 % of urban resi - dents report > 1 visit to an LPM in the preceding year ( Ta - ble 2 ) . Most respondents who purchased poultry in LPMs reported close contact with live poultry before slaughter . It is likely that the number of laboratory - confirmed cases of influenza A ( H7N9 ) virus infection is lower than the ac - tual number of human infections to date ( 8 ) , and our results show that a broad cross - section of urban residents could be exposed to influenza A ( H7N9 ) virus if it were prevalent among poultry in LPMs . In the spring 2013 outbreak , some evidence pointed to high prevalence of influenza A ( H7N9 ) Emerging Infectious Diseases • www . cdc . gov / eid • Vol . 20 , No . 8 , August 2014 1301 Figure 3 . Age - and sex - specific patterns in exposures to live poultry markets in 5 urban areas of China , 2013 . A ) Chengdu ; B ) Guangzhou ; C ) Shanghai ; D ) Shenyang ; E ) Wuhan . RESEARCH virus in certain LPMs ( 6 ) , whereas official surveillance data from the Ministry of Agriculture identified the virus in only a small proportion of samples collected from across the country ( of 4 , 488 samples tested , 0 . 9 % were positive for the virus ) ( 11 ) . The absolute risk for human infection after close contact with poultry infected with the influenza A ( H7N9 ) virus remains unclear . We found that men in the 55 – 64 - year age group had more exposures to live poultry than women in that age group , but no difference by sex among the small number of respondents ≥65 years of age in Shanghai ( Figure 3 ) . We had previously hypothesized that exposure to poultry in LPMs might be higher for older men than for older women ( 3 ) . Our findings suggest that the higher risk for laboratory - confirmed influenza A ( H7N9 ) virus infection among men during the spring 2013 outbreak in the Yangtze River Delta might not be explained by sex differences in exposure but rather by increased susceptibility to serious disease after infection among men ( e . g . , because of greater prevalence of co - existing conditions ) or by increased access to health care and laboratory testing for men . However , our sample size was relatively small , particularly for respondents > 65 years of age . As in a previous report of live poultry expo - sures in the southern China cities of Guangzhou in 2006 and Shenzhen in 2007 ( 9 ) , we did not identify major dif - ferences in exposures among middle - aged adults com - pared with exposures among the elderly . However , most laboratory - confirmed influenza A ( H7N9 ) cases have been in persons > 60 years of age ( 3 ) , consistent with our hypoth - esis that exposures in middle - aged adults may have led to milder disease that was less likely to result in laboratory testing ( 3 , 9 ) . A minority of respondents reported willingness to accept LPM closures in the event of future outbreaks of influenza A ( H7N9 ) . During the winter 2013 – 14 influenza season , in some areas where human cases of influenza A ( H7N9 ) had been reported , local governments imple - mented short - term LPM closures ; other administrations , including that of Shanghai , closed LPMs for longer peri - ods . However , such interventions can have serious eco - nomic consequences .

Human Exposure to Live Poultry and Responses to Influenza to make additional closures should be considered carefully . Regular rest days ( i . e . , days on which live poultry are not sold and stalls must be disinfected and left empty of live birds ) and bans on overnight retention of live poultry in markets have been successful in controlling the transmis - sion of avian influenza viruses in LPMs in Hong Kong ( 20 , 21 ) and have been proposed in some areas of China ( 8 ) . Although almost all cases of influenza A ( H7N9 ) cases have been identified in areas within or surrounding large cities , about half of the laboratory - confirmed avian influenza A ( H5N1 ) cases in China were identified in ru - ral residents , which indicates that avian influenza viruses can reach backyard poultry flocks and pose a risk to hu - man health ( 3 ) . Influenza A ( H7N9 ) virus does not appear to have spread to backyard flocks at this time , however . Most confirmed human cases have occurred in urban ar - eas among persons who have reported recent exposure to live poultry in LPMs , although a smaller number of cases occurred in persons who have reported recent exposure to backyard poultry ( 3 ) . However , if the circulation of influen - za A ( H7N9 ) virus in backyard poultry were to increase , the number of potential exposures could be substantial because almost half of rural residents report raising backyard poul - try . The risk for influenza A ( H5N1 ) virus infection among rural residents has been reduced through better education about the danger of close contact with , or consumption of , sick or dead backyard poultry ( 22 , 23 ) . Unfortunately , this approach would not be effective for controlling spread of influenza A ( H7N9 ) virus because infected chickens do not show signs of illness . Perception of risk for influenza A ( H7N9 ) infection by respondents to our surveys was generally low , as might be expected given the small number of laboratory - confirmed cases in China .

RESEARCH difficulties for policy measures such as closure of LPMs . Indeed , we found generally low levels of public support for long - term closure of LPMs ( Table 2 ) , particularly in cities that had not been affected by influenza A ( H7N9 ) . Respondents in Guangzhou and Shanghai reported higher likelihood than residents of other cities that they would be worried if they showed signs and symptoms of ILI . This finding is unsurprising for Shanghai , but there had been no confirmed influenza A ( H7N9 ) cases in Guangzhou at the time of our survey . Our study has several limitations . First , the cross - sectional study design did not enable us to identify chang - es over time in risk perception or preventive behaviors . Having access to data on live poultry exposures before the identification of influenza A ( H7N9 ) virus infections would have been helpful because the epidemic may have led to changes in exposure patterns by the time our survey was conducted . Second , because the survey was conduct - ed by telephone in urban areas and face - to - face in rural areas , our results may have been affected by selection bias . We did attempt multiple calls to unanswered tele - phone numbers in an attempt to mitigate this bias , but the overall response rate for the telephone survey was low . Also , because the respondents self - reported their behav - iors , the results might be affected by response biases ( e . g . , if respondents had incomplete recollection of past visits to LPMs ) . In particular , results could have been affected by social desirability bias if respondents felt uncomfortable reporting true patterns of poultry exposure or attitudes toward government interventions and preferred to report what they perceived to be ideal or most acceptable . Third , our analyses did not explore in depth the social or psychological factors underlying behavioral responses to influenza A ( H7N9 ) , such as the effect of perceived risk or severity . This area might be productive for further in - vestigation . Fourth , similar to other cross - sectional knowl - edge – attitude – behavior studies , our survey could only provide descriptive data on live poultry exposure , risk perception , and behavioral changes . Inferences on the as - sociations between different psychobehavioral factors will require further study . Furthermore , we did not investigate seasonal variation in poultry - purchasing behaviors , which could also be studied in longitudinal surveys . In conclusion , exposures to live poultry are common in many areas of China . If influenza A ( H7N9 ) virus were to become more prevalent among poultry , the number of hu - man exposures could be substantial in the absence of control measures . Our findings highlight possible problems in the structure of the live poultry trade in China and the potential for improved protection of human and animal health ( 8 , 24 ) .

At least 500 adult residents ( age ≥18y ) who had been living in the city for at least 1 year were interviewed . The telephone surveys were conducted using a Computer - Assisted Telephone Interviewing system , which enabled random generation of mobile telephone numbers and systematic data collection across each city . After explaining the study and obtaining verbal consent from respondents , they were recruited as study subjects and asked to complete the survey . If the respondents were busy at the time , a telephone call would be made later when the respondents were available to finish the questionnaire . Unanswered numbers were given 4 more follow - up calls , made at different hours and days of the week , before being classified as invalid .
