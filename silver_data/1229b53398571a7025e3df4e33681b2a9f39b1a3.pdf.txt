Supplementary Material Optimization and Numerical Analysis Here we describe the main features of our optimization procedure , from both the theo - retical and the numerical approximation viewpoints . Although our optimization problem falls into the class of the so - called Optimal Control Problems ( OCP ) in continuous time , it is not standard in some aspects . In the next subsections , we describe the problem , its main features , and the methods we use to find solutions and to approximate them . We pay particular attention to the points which are non - trivial and technically involved . Basic ingredients of the optimal control problem . In an OCP one identifies the key variables which describe the state of the system , or the “state” variables , and the ones which are under the control of the optimizing agent , the “control” variables . The state variables belong to a set Z , the “state space . ” This is typically a subset of R n , where n is the number of state variables . The control variables belong to a set K , the “control space . ” This is typically a subset of R m , where m is the number of control variables . Both state and control variables may change with time , t , where t ∈ [ 0 , T ] . We refer to 0 as the initial time , while T is the final time , also called the “horizon” of the problem . We term a “control strategy” a function k ( · ) : [ 0 , T ] → K and a “state trajectory” a function z ( · ) : [ 0 , T ] → Z . Clearly not all control strategies are suitable for a given problem . Hence , later , we will introduce the set of admissible control strategies . Given the above , the main ingredients of an OCP are : • the state equations which describe the time evolution of the state variables ; i . e . , the state trajectory z ( · ) , depending on the choice of the control strategies k ( · ) ; • the objective functional to be optimized on the time span [ 0 , T ] over all admissible control strategies . The state / control variables and the state equations . The control variables in our model are • the lockdown intensity p ∈ [ 0 , p max ] , where p max is its maximum value ; • the testing intensity τ ∈ [ 0 , τ max ] , where τ max is the maximum rate of testing ( or testing capacity ) . Hence in our setting k : = ( p , τ ) and K = [ 0 , p max ] × [ 0 , τ max ] . We will usually set p max = 1 , assuming that complete lockdown is possible , and τ max = 365 / 2 in days − 1 , which is a reasonable value for the maximum testing capacity of a developed country . Clearly such parameters can be chosen differently , as we do for example in Section 3 where we consider the case where the maximum testing capacity is reduced by a factor 1 / 3 . The state variables are the eight epidemiological variables as discussed in the main text : S , C , E 1 , E 2 , I 1 , I 2 , R , D c which , for brevity , will be denoted by the vector z ∈ R 8 , with the components in the above order . All state variables are required to be positive and smaller than the initial size of the population N 0 . Hence , the state space , Z , is the compact subset of R 8 given by Z : = [ 0 , N 0 ] 8 . For brevity we will often denote the control strategies at time t by k ( t ) and the state trajectories at time t by z ( t ) . The state equations form a system of eight Ordinary Differential Equations ( ODEs ) which we rewrite here emphasizing the time dependent variables : ˙ S ( t ) = µN ( t ) − µS ( t ) − ( 1 − p ( t ) ) 2 β S ( t ) ( E 2 ( t ) ( 1 − γ ) + γI 1 ( t ) ) ( 1 + c ) N ( t ) + ϕR ( t ) + τ ( t ) (cid:18) r + 1 − r 1 + c (cid:19) C ( t ) s p + δC ( t ) − τ ( t ) rS ( t ) ( 1 − s p ) ( 1 ) ˙ C ( t ) = ( 1 − p ( t ) ) 2 β ( cS ( t ) − ( 1 − ϵ C ) C ( t ) ) E 2 ( t ) ( 1 − γ ) + γI 1 ( t ) N ( t ) + τ ( t ) rS ( t ) ( 1 − s p ) − µC ( t ) − τ ( t ) (cid:18) r + 1 − r 1 + c (cid:19) C ( t ) s p − δC ( t ) ( 2 ) ˙ E 1 ( t ) = ( 1 − p ( t ) ) 2 β ( S ( t ) + ( 1 − ϵ C ) C ( t ) ) E 2 ( t ) ( 1 − γ ) + γI 1 ( t ) N ( t ) − ( µ + φ 1 ) E 1 ( t ) − τ ( t ) (cid:18) r + 1 − r 1 + c (cid:19) s e E 1 ( t ) ( 3 ) ˙ E 2 ( t ) = φ 1 E 1 ( t ) − ( µ + φ 2 ) E 2 ( t ) − τ ( t ) (cid:18) r + 1 − r 1 + c (cid:19) s e E 2 ( t ) ( 4 ) ˙ I 1 ( t ) = φ 2 E 2 ( t ) + τ ( t ) s e (cid:18) r + 1 − r 1 + c (cid:19) ( E 1 ( t ) + E 2 ( t ) ) − ( µ + µ I 1 + ( 1 − η ) δ 1 + ηδ 1 ) I 1 ( t ) ( 5 ) ˙ I 2 ( t ) = ηδ 1 I 1 ( t ) − ( µ + p M δ 2 + ( 1 − p M ) δ 2 ) I 2 ( t ) ( 6 ) ˙ R ( t ) = ( 1 − η ) δ 1 I 1 ( t ) + ( 1 − p M ) δ 2 I 2 ( t ) − ( µ + µ R + ϕ ) R ( t ) ( 7 ) ˙ D c ( t ) = µ I 1 I 1 ( t ) + p M δ 2 I 2 ( t ) + µ E E 2 ( t ) + µ R R ( t ) ( 8 ) where N ( t ) : = S ( t ) + C ( t ) + E 1 ( t ) + E 2 ( t ) + I 1 ( t ) + I 2 ( t ) + R ( t ) , ∀ t ∈ [ 0 , T ] ( 9 ) with N ( 0 ) = N 0 . It is useful to observe that in the state equations above we have , for all t ∈ [ 0 , T ] , N ′ ( t ) + D ′ c ( t ) = 0 ⇐⇒ N ( t ) + D c ( t ) = N 0 . Since D c ( · ) is always positive and increasing , it follows that N ( t ) is decreasing . Remark 1 If the mortality rates due to the epidemic are low , as is the case for COVID - 19 ( which is our driving example ) , then N ( t ) remains very close to N 0 . In that case , ( see e . g . ( 40 ) and ( 41 ) ) , we can substitute N ( t ) with N 0 in the above equations ( and also below in the objective functional ) . While not necessary for our numerical procedure , this step simplifies the numerical approximations . For later use , we introduce the notation for the state equations . We call F : Z × K → R 8 the function defined by the right hand side of the state equations ; i . e . , F ( S , C , E 1 , E 2 , I 1 , I 2 , R , D c ; p , τ ) = ( 10 )   µN − µS − ( 1 − p ) 2 β S ( E 2 ( 1 − γ ) + γI 1 ) ( 1 + c ) N + ϕR + τ (cid:16) r + 1 − r 1 + c (cid:17) Cs p + δC − τrS ( 1 − s p ) ( 1 − p ) 2 β ( cS − ( 1 − ϵ C ) C ) E 2 ( 1 − γ ) + γI 1 N + τrS ( 1 − s p ) − µC − τ (cid:16) r + 1 − r 1 + c (cid:17) Cs p − δC ( 1 − p ) 2 β ( S + ( 1 − ϵ C ) C ) E 2 ( 1 − γ ) + γI 1 N − ( µ + φ 1 ) E 1 − τ (cid:16) r + 1 − r 1 + c (cid:17) s e E 1 φ 1 E 1 − ( µ + φ 2 ) E 2 − τ (cid:16) r + 1 − r 1 + c (cid:17) s e E 2 φ 2 E 2 + τs e (cid:16) r + 1 − r 1 + c (cid:17) ( E 1 + E 2 ) − ( µ + µ I 1 + ( 1 − η ) δ 1 + ηδ 1 ) I 1 ηδ 1 I 1 − ( µ + p M δ 2 + ( 1 − p M ) δ 2 ) I 2 ( 1 − η ) δ 1 I 1 + ( 1 − p M ) δ 2 I 2 − ( µ + µ R + ϕ ) R µ I 1 I 1 + p M δ 2 I 2 + µ E E 2 + µ R R   ( 11 ) With this notation , the state equations can be rewritten more concretely as z ′ ( t ) = F ( z ( t ) ; k ( t ) ) . ( 12 ) Remark 2 The model can be studied for any choice of the initial conditions , z 0 , for the 8 state variables . Since our focus is the study of an emerging pathogen , our initial conditions will be those typical of the beginning of an epidemic ; i . e . , S ( 0 ) ∼ N 0 ; E 1 > 0 small ; E 2 , C , I 1 , I 2 , R , D C = 0 . See e . g . ( 40 , 41 , 48 ) . Choosing the admissible control strategies . The set of admissible control strategies , K ad , must be chosen in a way that the above system of state equations admits a unique solution for any initial conditions z ( 0 ) ∈ Z and remains in Z at all times . Moreover such a set of admissible strategies should be realistically implementable by the policymakers . The typical choice ( see Section III . 5 of ( 50 ) ) is to consider control strategies which are simply Lebesgue integrable ( this class of functions is usually chosen in similar contexts , since it contains the piecewise constant policies commonly employed by decision makers in practice , note that piecewise constant functions are not continuous , hence the class of continuous control strategies would not be an appropriate choice in our context ) i . e . , K ad : = { k ( · ) : [ 0 , T ] → K , Lebesgue integrable } . For any such strategy , k ( · ) ∈ K ad , and any initial condition z 0 ∈ Z the state equation has a unique solution . We refer to this as the state trajectory corresponding to k ( · ) and we denote it by z z 0 , k ( · ) ( t ) . The above set K ad consists of admissible policies that vary continuously with time . How - ever , since in practice our control policies cannot be changed continuously , for our simula - tions in the main text we employ control policies that assume only a finite number of values . We call an n - phase policy for n > 1 any control function that is piecewise constant and as - sumes only n different values on contiguous time intervals , excluding the value 0 . Moreover , we also impose that our control policy is null ( inactive ) before a fixed time , which we call delay in the main text , and which we denote hereafter by t 0 . Therefore we define the set of admissible controls with n > 1 phases ( assuming only one between p and τ is considered ) K nad = { k ( · ) : [ 0 , T ] → K , ∃ ( t 1 , . . . , t n ) ∈ ( t 0 , T ] n , ( k 1 , . . . , k n ) ∈ K n s . t . k ( t ) ≡ 0 for t ≤ t 0 , k ( t ) ≡ k i for t ∈ ( t i − 1 , t i ] for i = 1 , . . . , N , k ( t ) ≡ 0 for t > t n } , where we implicitly assumed the vector of times ( t 1 , . . . , t n ) to be monotonically increasing . It is clear from the previous definition that any function in K nad can be represented with 2 n parameters , n for the vector of times when the policy changes , and n for the vector of intensity of the control policy in each phase . For n = 0 we define K 0 ad = { k : [ 0 , T ] → K , k ( t ) ≡ 0 } , the space consisting only of the zero function ; that is , in this case the control does not affect the system . Even if the function space K nad is not finite - dimensional as a vector space , the parame - terization adopted here allows us to represent each element of K nad using a finite number of parameters ( 2 n ) . However , notice that this representation is not unique , since two different combinations of the 2 n parameters may describe the same function ( in particular in the case where two consecutive i i are equal ) . In the case where both ( p , τ ) are present , we introduce the sets K n , p ad and K M , τ ad for each of the controls and we define K n , M ad = K n , p ad × K M , τ ad . Notice in particular that the number of lockdown phases , n , can be different from the number of testing interventions , M . In what follows , the above sets of strategies will be denoted generically by K ad or , in case when the specification of the number of phases is needed , by K n , M ad . The objective functional to optimize : the starting problem ( P 0 ) . To define the objective functional we set Y ( t ) = A 0 ( 1 − p ( t ) ) ∆ + α L ( t ) α − Φ ( x ( t ) , N ( t ) ) ( 13 ) with N ( t ) as in ( 9 ) and L ( t ) = S ( t ) + ϵ C [ C ( t ) + E 1 ( t ) + E 2 ( t ) ] + R ( t ) x ( t ) = τ ( t ) [ C ( t ) + E 1 ( t ) + E 2 ( t ) + rS ( t ) ] , the total number of people tested , where the function Φ for the cost of testing is given by Φ ( x , N ) = ρ 0 x + exp (cid:18) ρ 1 N − x (cid:19) − exp (cid:16) ρ 1 N (cid:17) The objective functional to maximize is the Total Social Welfare ( TSW ) function specified in equation ( 10 ) in the main paper text over all admissible control strategies , i . e . over all k ( · ) ∈ K ad . Here we denote it by J 0 ( k ( · ) ) to underline its dependence on the control strategies chosen by the policy - maker . J 0 ( k ( · ) ) = (cid:90) T 0 U ( Y ( t ) ) − θV ( D c ( t ) ) d t ( 14 ) with : U ( Y ) = Y 1 − σ 1 − σ σ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) V ( D c ) = D ωc ω ω > 1 ; Note that the utility from production is strictly concave while the disutility from deaths is strictly convex . Our framework allows us to consider different types of utility / disutility functions . In what follows , we refer to “Problem ( P 0 ) ” as the problem of maximizing the functional J 0 ( k ( · ) ) over all k ( · ) ∈ K ad , under the state equations ( 12 ) . Note that , using the above setup , we can write the so - called running cost ( i . e . the function appearing inside the integral in J 0 ) as a function f 0 ( z ( t ) ; k ( t ) ) where f 0 : R 8 × R 2 → R , more precisely ( for brevity we write , as usual , N for S + C + E 1 + E 2 + I 1 + I 2 + R ) f 0 ( S , C , E 1 , E 2 , I 1 , I 2 , R , D c ; p , τ ) = ( 15 ) U (cid:0) A 0 ( 1 − p ) ∆ + α ( S + R + ϵ C [ C + E 1 + E 2 ] ) α − Φ ( τ [ C + E 1 + E 2 + rS ] , N ) (cid:1) − θV ( D c ) The objective functional to optimize : the real exit time problem ( P ) . As formu - lated above , problem ( P 0 ) has an important drawback due to the fact that , even if all the infected compartments ( E 1 , E 2 , I 1 , I 2 ) are close to zero , the epidemic may restart . To avoid this artifact of continuous numbers of individuals , we introduce the following modification . We first define for any given admissible state trajectory z z 0 , k ( · ) ( · ) ( associated to an initial datum z 0 ∈ Z and a control strategy k ( · ) ∈ K ad ) , and any closed region O ⊂ Z , the first entry time T O as T O ( z z 0 , k ( · ) ( · ) ) : = inf { t ≥ 0 : z ( t ) ∈ O } For brevity we will write T O ( z 0 , k ( · ) ) , or simply T O when no confusion is possible . In our problem , as explained in the main text ( see Section 3 . 2 ) , we set O : = (cid:8) z ∈ R 8 : 0 ≤ z 3 , z 4 , z 5 , z 6 ≤ 1 (cid:9) The idea is that after time T O the epidemic is no longer present and so both control variables and all the state variables E 1 , E 2 , I 1 , I 2 are set equal to 0 . The system still moves in the components S , R , D c following equations ˙ S ( t ) = µN ( t ) − µS ( t ) + ϕR ( t ) ˙ R ( t ) = − ( µ + µ R + ϕ ) R ( t ) ˙ D c ( t ) = µ R R ( t ) ( 16 ) with initial conditions given by their values at T O ) . If T O < T , these components still have an influence on the utility / disutility functions so we have to take them into account . Hence , we consider the following modification of the above functional J 0 : J 1 ( k ( · ) ) : = (cid:90) T ∧ T O 0 U ( Y ( t ) ) − θV ( D c ( t ) ) d t + (cid:90) T T ∧ T O U ( Y ( t ) ) − θV ( D c ( t ) ) d t ( 17 ) where in the second integral , Y ( t ) = A 0 ( S ( t ) + R ( t ) ) α and where the variables S ( t ) , R ( t ) , D c ( t ) solve ( 16 ) with initial conditions given by their values at T O . Note that to apply the standard optimality conditions for exit time problems ( see Section 8 . 4 of ( 5 1 ) ) , the target set O should not have corners like the one we use here . However , this does not present a problem here , as we use a discrete set of policies . Note that the second integral , when T O < (cid:0) T can (cid:1) be expressed as a given function Ψ ( which can be explicitly computed ) of T O and z T O so we can rewrite the functional J 1 as follows J 1 ( k ( · ) ) : = (cid:90) T ∧ T O 0 U ( Y ( t ) ) − θV ( D c ( t ) ) d t + Ψ ( T O , z ( T O ) ) 1 [ 0 , T ) ( T O ) ( 18 ) The notation 1 A stands for the indicator function of a set A ; i . e . , a function which is 1 on the set A and 0 elsewhere . Our Problem ( P ) is then maximizing J 1 with the above change of state equations . This is a standard optimal control problem with exit time ( see Chapter 8 in ( 5 1 ) ) . We have the following : Definition 1 Admissible policy k ∗ ( · ) is an optimal control policy if it maximizes J 1 ; i . e . , J 1 ( k ∗ ( · ) ) ≥ J 1 ( k ( · ) ) ∀ k ( · ) ∈ K ad . We define a n o ptimal s tate t rajectory z ∗ ( · ) a s t he u nique s olution o f t he s tate equation associated to an optimal control strategy . We define t he o ptimal ( k ∗ ( · ) , z ∗ ( · ) ) a s a n o rdered pair o f f unctions w here t he fi rst is an optimal control strategy and the second is its associated state trajectory . In some cases it is useful to emphasize in the notation the fact that the objective functional depends , through the state equations , also on the initial condition z ( 0 ) = z 0 , by writing J 1 ( k ( · ) ; z 0 ) in place of J 1 ( k ( · ) ) . We then define the value function as the function W ( z 0 ) : = sup k ( · ) ∈K ad J 1 ( k ( · ) ; z 0 ) defined for all z 0 ∈ Z . In economic terms this will be called the welfare function . Optimization in a finite dimensional setting ( fixed number of phases ) . Under a fixed number of control phases corresponding to the values taken by the piecewise con - stant controls ( p , τ ) , see subsection , the problem can be reduced to a finite - dimensional optimization problem with inequality constraints . Fix N to be the number of phases of the control p , and assume M = 0 ; i . e . , the control τ representing the testing policy is inactive at all times . The general case where N , M > 0 can be treated in the same manner by using a slightly more cumbersome notation . For every control policy p ∈ K N , p ad , we identify by I p and t p as the vectors of R N that represent intensities and times of phase change associated with the function p . We use the notation p I p , t p to denote such a policy . Therefore , our finite dimensional optimization problem becomes max I p , t p J 0 , P ′ ( p I p , t p ( · ) ) s . t . 0 ≤ i j ≤ 1 ∀ j = 1 , . . . , N , t j ≤ t j − 1 ∀ j = 1 , . . . , N , t N ≤ T . This is a standard finite dimensional optimization problem in R 2 N under 2 N + 1 inequality constraints . The problem here is that the objective function cannot be computed explicitly given the parameters of the controls . Hence we have to rely on a numerical approximation to compute the objective function , as well as to perform the numerical optimization . To compute the objective function we rely on classical numerical methods for ODEs . However , due to the lack of regularity of the controls , we employ a numerical method which is suitable for stiff problems , such as implicit Runge - Kutta methods of high order . To approximate the continuous time integration we employed a Gauss - Kronrod quadrature rule . The process of numerical optimization is challenging due to the lack of convexity in the objective function . In the absence of such convexity , there is no guarantee that a local optimum will also be a global one . Therefore , during the numerical optimization , we have to rely on a global optimization algorithm , which is numerically more demanding than a local numerical optimizer . In figure S1 , we analyze the case of a single lockdown phase , showing the shape of the objective function for many combinations of the parameter describing the control policy using a very fine grid . In this case we see that concavity is indeed a feature of the objective with respect to this parameterization . A general result concerning the shape of the objective function is however still lacking . It is well known that global optimization is one of the many problems suffering from the curse of dimensionality , that is the number of function evaluations required for a thorough search in the state space grows exponentially with the dimension of the problem . For the optimization procedure we employed both the DIRECT and DIRECT - L algorithm proposed in ( 43 , 47 ) . Both algorithms are deterministic procedures based on a subdivision of the domain in iteratively smaller rectangles until convergence is reached . To ensure robustness of our results , we also performed some additional tests based on a combination of a brute - force approach on a very fine grid with a local refinement based on a local optimizer . An additional confirmation of the accuracy of the optimization procedure is that the maximum value of the objective function shifts in the expected direction when changing some of the parameters ( e . g . when increasing the delay in the control policies the objective function decreases ) . The added benefits of wearing masks Arguably the most economical control strategy during the Covid pandemic has been the wearing of surgical masks at work and in public places . We have not incorporated the use of masks in our analysis , partly because we see it as an important ’safety play’ that is unlikely to stop the pandemic ; masks may provide some protection to those that wear them , while also significantly reducing transmission from asymptomatic infected hosts . An important limitation here is that we do not have good estimates of the efficacy of masks ( neither for transmission blocking , nor for protection ) . The best available methods suggest an average efficiency of around 45 percent ( averaged across both transmission blocking and susceptible d u r a t i o n s 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 i n t e n s i t i e s 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 Figure S1 .

The x - axis “durations” refers to the length of the single lock - down phase , while the y - axis “intensities” refers to the strength of the policy . In this case the objective function is convex with respect to the parameteri - zation adopted . protection ) . Similarly , the proportion of people wearing masks varies widely and may follow current levels of infection and perceived risk in the population . We have not explicitly examined the dynamic consequences of wearing face masks ( see ( 39 ) ) . Instead we present a simple static analysis that compares the efficacy of face masks with that of a vaccine ( Appendix 2 ) . We do this as there has been resistance to wearing face masks and wearing them is subject to asymmetric and poorly quantified levels of efficacy . Specifically , when an infected individual wears a mask it may trap a high proportion of the viral infection stages they produce , e i , but not all of them . Similarly , uninfected hosts who wear masks reduce their level of exposure but are unlikely to completely exclude viral particles , their masks have a protective efficiency of e p . The efficacy of both processes will vary with the type of mask and how it is worn . We can examine the static implications of this by modifying the standard equation for the proportion of people who need to be vaccinated , p c , to reduce the Basic Reproductive Number of a pathogen , R 0 , below unity ( 19 , 20 , 40 ) , p c = ( 1 − 1 / R 0 ) ( 20 ) The proportion of people who have to wear masks at different levels of R 0 is given by p c = ( 1 − √ e p e i / R 0 ) ( 21 ) We coarsely quantify mask efficacy as the geometric mean of the two types of mask ef - ficacy , this is plainly a conservative calculation as there are always more uninfected than infected hosts . Figure S2 illustrates the relationship between the Basic Reproductive Num - ber , R 0 , of the pathogen and the proportion of people who have to wear masks at different average levels of mask efficacy as protective devices .

The dotted lines illustrate the ”classical’ curve for a totally efficient vaccine that generates lifetime immunity . The colored lines illustrate the cases for different levels of protective efficiency for mask - wearers ; this efficiency is assumed to be the geometric mean efficacy of protecting the wearer from infection and preventing transmission from an infectious person . The purple line signifies 90 percent mean efficacy , green 50 percent , etc . figure is that even when masks are 90 percent efficient , they are always less efficient than vaccination and the proportion of people wearing them has to increase rapidly as their effi - cacy declines . Nonetheless , the figure serves to underline our main point , a high proportion of people have to wear very efficient masks if they are to be effective in reducing R 0 below unity . They will still serve the useful function of slowing the epidemic and reducing the pressure on health care services . Ultimately , we see them as a useful adjunct to the other forms of NPI discussed in more detail below . If more people wear masks , then lock - downs can be shorter and impact a smaller proportion of the economy . REFERENCES AND NOTES 1 . D .
