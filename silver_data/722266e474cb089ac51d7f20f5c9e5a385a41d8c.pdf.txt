M208806200 Jaehoon Jung‡ § , Taesook Yoon‡ ¶ , Eung Chil Choi § , and Kyunglim Lee‡ (cid:1) From the ‡ College of Pharmacy , Center for Cell Signaling Research and Division of Molecular Life Sciences , Ewha Woman’s University , Seoul 120 - 750 , Korea and the § College of Pharmacy , Seoul National University , Seoul 151 742 , Korea We reported previously that cofilin , an actin - binding protein , interacts with Na , K - ATPase and enhances its activity ( Lee , K . , Jung , J . , Kim , M . , and Guidotti , G . ( 2001 ) Biochem . J . 353 , 377 – 385 ) . To understand the na - ture of this interaction and the role of cofilin in the regulation of Na , K - ATPase activity , we searched for co - filin - binding proteins in the rat skeletal muscle cDNA library using the yeast two - hybrid system . Several cDNA clones were isolated , some of which coded for triose - phosphate isomerase , a glycolytic enzyme . The interac - tion of cofilin with triose - phosphate isomerase as well as Na , K - ATPase was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy in HeLa cells . Cofilin was translocated to the plasma membrane along with triose - phosphate isomerase by the Rho activator lysophospha - tidic acid but not by the p160 Rho - associated kinase inhibitor Y - 27632 , suggesting that the phosphorylated form of cofilin bound to TPI interacts with Na , K - ATPase . Ouabain - sensitive 86 Rb (cid:1) uptake showed that Na , K - ATPase activity was increased by the overexpression of cofilin and lysophosphatidic acid treatment , but not by the overexpression of mutant cofilin S3A and Y - 27632 treatment . Pretreatment with the glycolytic inhibitor iodoacetic acid caused a remarkable reduction of Na , K - ATPase activity , whereas pretreatment with the oxida - tive inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m - chlorophenylhydra - zone caused no detectable changes , suggesting that the phosphorylated cofilin is involved in feeding glycolytic fuel for Na , K - ATPase activity . These findings provide a novel molecular mechanism for the regulation of Na , K - ATPase activity and for the nature of the functional coupling of cellular energy transduction . Cofilin exists ubiquitously in eukaryotes and is essential for cell viability ( 2 ) . Cofilin binds to both G - and F - actins and severs and depolymerizes actin filaments . Cofilin is usually localized to the regions that require rapid actin assembly , such as neural growth cones , developing skeletal muscle , cell cortex , ruffling membranes , and cleavage furrow ( 3 – 8 ) . In recent stud - ies , it has been shown that human cofilin forms oligomers , which exhibit actin severing activity , and human cyclase - asso - ciated protein - 1 is a key factor in the recycling of cofilin and actin ( 9 , 10 ) . It has been reported that in some cell types , the dephosphorylation of cofilin occurs in a calcium - dependent or - independent manner and accompanies nuclear uptake ( 11 – 18 ) . On the other hand , dephosphorylation without nuclear uptake occurs in thyroid cells , and nuclear accumulation with - out dephosphorylation occurs in myotubes ( 19 , 20 ) . In all cases , Slingshot , a family of phosphatases , regulates actin reorgani - zation through the dephosphorylation of cofilin ( 21 ) . One suggested mechanism for the regulation of cofilin activ - ity is the reversible phosphorylation of a conserved serine 3 residue , the phosphorylation depending on LIM kinase - 1 or - 2 , which are regulated , respectively , by the GTPases Rac and Rho / Cdc42 ( 22 – 25 ) . Another possible mechanism is through binding of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate to the actin binding domain of cofilin ( 26 , 27 ) . However , elucidation of the mechanisms for phosphorylation of cofilin and its inactivation has not resulted in an understanding of the physiological role of the inactive form of cofilin . We reported previously that cofilin interacts with Na , K - ATPase and enhances its activity ( 1 ) . To understand the func - tional role of cofilin in the regulation of Na , K - ATPase activity , we screened a rat skeletal muscle cDNA library for cDNAs coding for novel proteins that interact with cofilin , using the yeast two - hybrid system . We found that cofilin interacts with triose - phosphate isomerase ( TPI ) , 1 which catalyzes the inter - conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate , a process that completes the preparatory phase of glycolysis . Because it has been demonstrated that ATP from glycolysis is required for Na , K - ATPase activity and that glyco - lytic enzymes are associated with structural proteins and plasma membrane complexes ( 28 – 31 ) , we hypothesized that the interaction of cofilin with TPI might serve to feed glycolytic ATP for Na , K - ATPase activity .

Galactose Ura - His - Trp - Leu - dependent transformants were obtained . Plasmid DNA species were rescued and reintroduced individually into EGY48 / pSH18 - 34 , either alone or with the LexA fusion plasmids to eliminate false positives . (cid:1) - Galactosidase activity was measured as described ( 1 ) . Plasmids encoding potential cofilin - interacting proteins were identified by DNA sequencing with the primer 5 (cid:1) - TACCCTTATGATGTGCCA - 3 (cid:1) , corresponding to the hemag - glutinin ( HA ) tag sequences in the pJG4 - 5 library vector . Coimmunoprecipitations— HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 units / ml penicillin , and 100 units / ml streptomycin . An N - terminal HA - tagged cofilin construct in pcDNAneo ( Invitrogen ) , C - terminal blue fluorescence protein ( BFP ) - tagged cofilin , or cofilin S3A ( in which Ser - 3 is replaced with Ala ) , and C - terminal BFP - tagged TPI were transiently transfected with the LipofectAMINE PLUS ( Invitrogen ) . After trans - fection , the HeLa cells were treated with 10 (cid:2) M lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) ( Sigma ) or 10 (cid:2) M Y - 27632 ( Tocris ) for 30 min after serum star - vation and incubated with ice - cold lysis buffer ( 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 m M NaCl , 5 m M EDTA , 2 m M EGTA , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , NaF , Na 3 VO 4 , Complete (cid:1) protease inhibitor mixture tab - lets ) for 30 min on ice and gently homogenized with Pyrex 7727 - 07 . The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10 , 000 (cid:2) g at 4 °C for 10 min . The total cell lysates ( 1 mg / ml ) were incubated overnight with 12CA5 monoclonal antibody , rat anti - cofilin polyclonal antiserum , or rabbit affinity - puri - fied anti - GFP polyclonal antibody ( Clontech ) at 4 °C . Protein A - or G - agarose ( Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) was then added and the mixture incubated for an additiona l 4 h at 4°C . Protein A - or G - agarose - bound immune complexes so obtained were pelletized and washed twice with ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . After washing , the im - mune complexes were eluted with 2 (cid:2) SDS sample buffer and separated on 12 % SDS - PAGE . Blots were incubated with 12CA5 monoclonal an - tibody , rat anti - cofilin polyclonal antiserum , rabbit anti - TPI polyclonal antiserum , rabbit anti - GFP polyclonal antibody , rabbit anti - phospho - serine polyclonal antibody ( Zymed Laboratories Inc . ) , or rabbit anti - Na , K - ATPase polyclonal antibody ( Upstate Biotechnology ) . Membrane Fractionation— HeLa cells cultured as described above were treated with 10 (cid:2) M LPA or 10 (cid:2) M Y - 27632 for 30 min , incubated with ice - cold lysis buffer for 30 min on ice , and gently homogenized with Pyrex 7727 - 07 . The homogenates were centrifuged at 2 , 500 (cid:2) g , at 4 °C for 10 min , and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 40 , 000 (cid:2) g , at 4 °C for 30 min . After centrifugation , the supernatant containing the cytosolic fraction and the pellet containing crude membrane fraction were separated , and the pellets were then resuspended in lysis buffer ( 1 % Triton X - 100 ) . Each fraction was loaded onto a 12 % SDS - polyacryl - amide gel and identified using anti - cofilin polyclonal antiserum , anti - GFP polyclonal antibody , anti - TPI polyclonal antiserum , and anti - Na , K - ATPase polyclonal antibody . Immunofluorescence Microscopy— HeLa cells were cultured on an 18 - mm (cid:3) cover glass in the presence or absence of serum and treated with 10 (cid:2) M LPA or 10 (cid:2) M Y - 27632 after serum starvation . The cells were fixed for 10 min in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS containing Ca 2 (cid:3) / Mg 2 (cid:3) and incubated with rat anti - cofilin polyclonal antiserum , rabbit anti - TPI polyclonal antiserum , or mouse Na , K - ATPase monoclonal an - tibody ( Upstate Biotechnology ) in PBS containing 0 . 1 % saponin for 1 h at room temperature on a tilting platform . Subsequently , the cells were incubated with anti - rat aminomethylcoumarin , anti - rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate , or anti - mouse - rhodamine second antibody ( Jackson Laboratories ) , mounted in anti - bleaching agent solution , and analyzed by laser confocal microscopy LSM 510 ( Carl Zeiss ) . Measurement of Na , K - ATPase Activity— 500 (cid:2) l of HeLa cells ( 3 . 0 (cid:2) 10 5 (cid:4) 1 (cid:2) 10 6 cells / ml ) was inoculated into 24 wells and transiently transfected with cofilin - BFP or cofilin - BFPS3A plasmids . After 24 – 36 h , the serum - starved cells were washed with Krebs - Ringer phosphate buffer ( 140 m M NaCl , 5 m M KCl , 10 m M Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 m M MgSO 4 , 1 . 4 m M CaCl 2 , 2 . 5 m M glucose , pH 7 . 4 ) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with or without 1 m M ouabain in 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin - containing Krebs - Ringer phosphate buffer . The cells were treated with 10 (cid:2) M LPA , or 10 (cid:2) M Y - 27632 , or 50 (cid:2) M iodoacetic acid ( IAA ) , or 0 . 1 (cid:2) M carbonyl cyanide m - chlorophenylhydrazone ( CCCP ) for 30 min . The 86 Rb (cid:3) was used as a tracer to measure the uptake of K (cid:3) . After a 5 (cid:4) 10 - min incubation with 86 Rb (cid:3) ( 2 (cid:2) Ci / ml ) , cellular 86 Rb (cid:3) uptake was stopped by the addition of ice - chilled Krebs - Ringer phosphate buffer , and the cells were washed twice and lysed by adding 50 m M NaOH . The cell lysates were then counted after mixing with scintillation mixture . The differ - ence between 86 Rb (cid:3) uptake in the presence and absence of ouabain was taken as ouabain - sensitive 86 Rb (cid:3) uptake . Determination of Intracellular Sodium— 500 (cid:2) l of HeLa cells ( 3 . 0 (cid:2) 10 5 (cid:4) 1 (cid:2) 10 6 cells / ml ) was inoculated into 24 wells and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium . After serum starvation , the cells were treated with 10 (cid:2) M LPA , 10 (cid:2) M Y - 27632 , 50 (cid:2) M IAA , or 0 . 1 (cid:2) M CCCP for 30 min and trypsinized . The cells were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min with a buffer prepared as follows . A stock solution of 2 m M sodium green tetraacetate ( Molecular Probes ) in dimethyl sulfoxide was mixed with an equal volume of 20 % ( w / v ) pluronic F - 127 in dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted with Ham’s F - 12 medium ( in 2 m M sodium bicarbonate and 10 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 3 , without phenol red and serum ) to a final concentration of 8 (cid:2) M sodium green tetraacetate and less than 0 . 1 % detergent . The cells were then washed with PBS three times . Changes in the fluorescence intensity of sodium green tetraacetate were determined , employing flow cytometry ( BD Biosciences ) . Excitation was performed with a 488 nm argon laser , and fluorescent emission was detected at 530 nm ( FL - 1 ) . All flow cyto - metric analyses were accomplished using CellQuest software . RESULTS Cofilin Interacts with TPI and Na , K - ATPase Simultaneously at the Plasma Membrane— To understand the functional role of cofilin in the regulation of Na , K - ATPase activity , we searched for cofilin - binding proteins using the yeast two - hybrid assay . Using this approach , we were able to isolate 25 clones coding for rat TPI , 3 clones coding for rat proteasome subunit RC5 , and several clones coding unknown proteins . Because full - length cofilin clone activates reporter genes without interact - F IG . 1 . Cofilin interacts with TPI and Na , K - ATPase simulta - neously . A , HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 100 units / ml penicillin . The HA - tagged cofilin ( N terminus ) and BFP - tagged TPI ( C terminus ) were transiently transfected . Immunoprecipitates were pre - pared from 1 mg / ml HeLa cell extracts with 12CA5 monoclonal anti - body . Total cell lysates ( 50 (cid:2) g ) and immune complexes ( IP ) were blotted sequentially with anti - GFP polyclonal antibody , anti - Na , K - ATPase polyclonal antibody , and anti - HA monoclonal antibody . B , HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde . After fixing , endogenous cofilin ( blue ) , TPI ( green ) , and Na , K - ATPase ( red ) were stained with rat anti - cofilin polyclonal antiserum , rabbit anti - TPI polyclonal antiserum , and mouse anti - Na , K - ATPase monoclonal antibody , respectively . The merged images of three molecules were magnified and showed colocalization at the plasma membrane ( white ) . Bar , 20 (cid:2) m . Cofilin and TPI Complex Functions as Glycolytic ATP Feeder 48932 by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 28 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m ing protein , we used cofilin clone 267 , which was short of 44 residues from the N terminus , as a bait in the yeast two - hybrid screening . However , we used rat full - length cofilin cDNA for further experiments . To confirm that cofilin interacts with TPI in vivo , we per - formed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using appropri - ately tagged antisera ( Fig . 1 A ) . Expression plasmids of both HA - tagged rat cofilin ( HA - cofilin ) and blue fluorescence - tagged rat TPI ( TPI - BFP ) were cotransfected transiently into HeLa cells . Immunoprecipitates were prepared from HeLa extracts with anti - HA monoclonal antibody and immunoblotted with anti - GFP polyclonal antibody . HA - cofilin coprecipitated 54 . 7 kDa of the TPI - BFP only from transfected cells ( Fig . 1 A ) . To determine whether cofilin interacts simultaneously with both TPI and Na , K - ATPase , we blotted the coprecipitated complex sequentially with rabbit Na , K - ATPase polyclonal antibody . 100 kDa of endogenous Na , K - ATPase was also detected only from transfected cells , suggesting that cofilin is complexed with TPI as well as Na , K - ATPase at the same time ( Fig . 1 A ) . This find - ing is in accord with our previous study ( 1 ) . To confirm the above coimmunoprecipitation results , we ex - amined , using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy , whether endogenous cofilin is complexed simultaneously with TPI and Na , K - ATPase in HeLa cells ( Fig . 1 B ) . When HeLa cells in serum - containing media were labeled with either rat anti - cofilin polyclonal antiserum ( blue ) or rabbit anti - TPI polyclonal antiserum ( green ) , we observed that endogenous cofilin was found distributed with polarized pattern in about half of the cell , whereas endogenous TPI was found distributed equally throughout the cell ( Fig . 1 B ) . On staining with monoclonal anti - Na , K - ATPase antibody ( red ) , endogenous Na , K - ATPase was also found throughout the cell but distributed mainly at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1 B ) . As can be seen in Fig . 1 B , middle panel , cofilin was colocalized with TPI as shown by merged azure color in the cytoplasm . Cofilin was also colocal - ized with Na , K - ATPase as well as TPI at the plasma membrane as shown by merged white color in the membrane region ( Fig . 1 B , right bottom panel , magnified ) . Colocalization of cofilin , TPI , and Na , K - ATPase at the plasma membrane region was observed only in serum - containing media but not in serum - free media . This may be because the serum phosphorylates cofilin via a Rho - ROCK - LIM kinase - mediated signaling pathway ( 23 , 32 – 34 ) . The Cofilin - TPI Complex Is Translocated from the Cytosol to the Plasma Membrane upon Activation of the Rho Signaling Pathway— Phosphorylation of cofilin inhibits its actin depolym - erizing activity . Cofilin is phosphorylated by LPA , which acti - F IG . 2 . Cofilin is translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane together with TPI by LPA . A , HeLa cells were incubated with 10 (cid:2) M LPA or 10 (cid:2) M Y - 27632 for 30 min after serum starvation . Then the cells were separated into cytosol ( C ) and membrane ( M ) fractions . Each cell fraction was blotted sequentially with anti - cofilin polyclonal antiserum , anti - TPI polyclonal antiserum , and anti - Na , K - ATPase polyclonal antibody . B , HeLa cells were transiently transfected with cofilin - BFP . After transfection , the cells were incubated with 10 (cid:2) M LPA or 10 (cid:2) M Y - 27632 for 30 min following serum starvation . Cell fractionation and blotting were performed as described above , replacing anti - cofilin polyclonal antiserum with anti - GFP polyclonal antibody . C , HeLa cells were transiently transfected with cofilin S3A - BFP , fraction - ated , and blotted with various antisera as described in B . F IG . 3 . Phosphorylated cofilin interacts with TPI and Na , K - ATPase simultaneously through the activation of Rho by LPA . A , HeLa cells were incubated with 10 (cid:2) M LPA or 10 (cid:2) M Y - 27632 for 30 min after serum starvation . Immunoprecipitates were prepared from 1 mg / ml HeLa cell extracts with anti - cofilin polyclonal antiserum . Total cell lysates ( 50 (cid:2) g ) and immune complexes ( IP ) were blotted sequen - tially with anti - TPI polyclonal antiserum , anti - Na , K - ATPase polyclonal antibody , anti - phosphoserine polyclonal antibody , and anti - cofilin poly - clonal antiserum . B , HeLa cells were transiently transfected with cofi - lin - BFP . Immunoprecipitation and blotting were performed as de - scribed above , replacing anti - cofilin polyclonal antiserum with anti - GFP polyclonal antibody . C , HeLa cells were transiently transfected with cofilin S3A - BFP . Immunoprecipitation and blotting were then performed as described in B .

This phosphorylation is inhibited by Y - 27632 , a specific inhibitor of ROCK which is a downstream effector of Rho and phosphorylates LIM kinase ( 23 ) . We therefore investigated whether the translocation of cofi - lin and TPI to the plasma membrane is under the control of a Rho - mediated signaling pathway ( Fig . 2 ) . After treatment of HeLa cells with LPA following serum starvation , translocation of both endogenous cofilin and TPI to the plasma membrane was increased remarkably ( Fig . 2 A ) . On the other hand , inhi - bition of ROCK by Y - 27632 ( 23 ) decreased the translocation ( Fig . 2 A ) . Endogenous Na , K - ATPase in membrane fraction was not affected by treatment with either LPA or Y - 27632 ( Fig . 2 A ) . Based on these data , it appears that cofilin bound to TPI may translocate to the plasma membrane to form local complexes with Na , K - ATPase and that the translocation process is under the control of a Rho - mediated signaling pathway . Cofilin exists in dephosphorylated and phosphorylated ( on the serine 3 residue ) forms ( 22 – 25 ) . To investigate the role of phosphorylation of cofilin in the translocation phenomenon , we constructed BFP - tagged wild type cofilin ( cofilin - BFP ) and a mutant cofilin , in which serine 3 was replaced with alanine ( cofilin S3A - BFP ) and used them for transient transfection of HeLa cells . Translocation of the overexpressed cofilin - BFP and endogenous TPI to the plasma membrane was increased upon treatment with LPA and decreased upon treatment with Y - 27632 , whereas endogenous Na , K - ATPase was not affected ( Fig . 2 B ) . However , neither overexpressed cofilin S3A - BFP nor endogenous TPI was changed in the plasma membrane frac - tion , even after treatment with either LPA or Y27632 ( Fig . 2 C ) , indicating that phosphorylated cofilin complexed with TPI translocates to the plasma membrane . To obtain more evidence that phosphorylated cofilin com - plexed with TPI translocates to the membrane and associates with Na , K - ATPase via a Rho - mediated signaling pathway , we introduced expression plasmids of cofilin - BFP and cofilin S3A - BFP into HeLa cells and performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments ( Fig . 3 ) . Immunoprecipitates were prepared from LPA - and Y - 27632 - treated HeLa cell lysates after serum star - vation and coprecipitated with either cofilin polyclonal anti - serum or GFP polyclonal antibody . We blotted the coprecipi - tated complexes sequentially with the following antibodies : anti - Na , K - ATPase polyclonal antibody , anti - TPI polyclonal an - tiserum , anti - cofilin polyclonal antibody , and anti - GFP poly - clonal antibody . We also examined the phosphorylated forms of both endogenous cofilin and overexpressed cofilin by blotting the coprecipitated complexes with anti - phosphoserine poly - clonal antibody . As shown in Fig . 3 , the phosphorylated forms of endogenous cofilin ( Fig . 3 A ) and cofilin - BFP ( Fig . 3 B ) were increased by LPA but decreased by Y - 27632 . Endogenous Na , K - ATPase immunoprecipitated with anti - cofilin antibody or anti - GFP antibody was also increased by LPA but decreased by Y - 27632 ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . We could not detect the phosphoryl - ated cofilin and Na , K - ATPase in immunoprecipitates from co - filin S3A - BFP cell extracts by the treatment of either LPA or Y - 27632 ( Fig . 3 C ) , which indicates that only phosphorylated cofilin is able to associate with Na , K - ATPase . However , there was a consistent amount of TPI in all of the immunoprecipi - tates , and this was not affected by treatment with either LPA or Y - 27632 . Taken together , these results suggest that the interaction of cofilin with TPI is not dependent on phosphoryl - ation of cofilin , which in turn suggests that both phosphoryl - ated and dephosphorylated forms of cofilin can bind to TPI , but only the phosphorylated cofilin complexed with TPI is able to associate with Na , K - ATPase . Next , we performed confocal immunofluorescence micros - copy to chase the movement of cofilin and TPI upon the treat - ment of LPA and Y27632 in HeLa cells ( Fig . 4 ) . After treatment with LPA and Y - 27632 following serum starvation , HeLa cells were labeled with cofilin polyclonal antiserum , TPI polyclonal antiserum , or Na , K - ATPase monoclonal antibody . Endogenous Na , K - ATPase was detected at the plasma membrane as well as in the cytoplasm , whereas endogenous cofilin and TPI were distributed throughout the cell excluding the plasma mem - brane in serum - starved HeLa cells ( Fig . 4 ) . They did not colo - calize with Na , K - ATPase at the plasma membrane in serum - starved HeLa cells ( Fig . 4 , merged and magnified panels in Control ) . However , in LPA - treated HeLa cells , endogenous co - filin and TPI became associated with Na , K - ATPase at the plasma membrane as shown by merged white colors ( Fig . 4 , merged and magnified panels in LPA ) . In contrast to treatment with LPA , treatment with Y - 27632 caused the accumulation of these proteins mainly in the nucleus , as shown by merged white colors ( Fig . 4 , merged and magnified panels in Y - 27632 ) . These results confirm that the association of cofilin with Na , K - ATPase at the plasma membrane requires phosphorylation of cofilin via a Rho - mediated signaling pathway . Phosphorylated Cofilin Is Involved in Feeding Glycolytic Fuel to Na , K - ATPase— Based on earlier reports that ATP from gly - colysis is required to regulate Na , K - ATPase ( 35 – 37 ) and that glycolytic enzymes are associated with structural proteins such F IG . 4 . Cofilin associates with TPI and Na , K - ATPase simultaneously at the plasma membrane region via Rho activation by LPA . HeLa cells were in - cubated with 10 (cid:2) M LPA or 10 (cid:2) M Y - 27632 for 30 min after serum starva - tion and fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde . After fixing , endogenous cofilin ( blue ) , TPI ( green ) , and Na , K - ATPase ( red ) were stained with rat anti - cofilin polyclonal an - tiserum , rabbit anti - TPI polyclonal anti - serum , and mouse anti - Na , K - ATPase monoclonal antibody , respectively . The merged images of three molecules were magnified and showed colocalization at the plasma membrane ( white ) . Bar , 20 (cid:2) m . Cofilin and TPI Complex Functions as Glycolytic ATP Feeder 48934 by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 28 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m as actin , microtubules , and plasma membrane ( 28 – 31 ) , we speculated that ATP produced by a glycolytic enzyme cluster including TPI may be channeled to the Na , K - ATPase and that the process is mediated via phosphorylated cofilin . To verify this , cofilin - BFP and cofilin S3A - BFP were transiently ex - pressed in HeLa cells , and Na , K - ATPase activity was meas - ured using ouabain - sensitive 86 Rb (cid:3) uptake assay ( Fig . 5 ) . Con - sistent with our previous report ( 1 ) , Na , K - ATPase activity of cofilin - BFP - transfected cells was about 31 % higher than that of mock - transfected cells ( Fig . 5 A ) . In contrast , the Na , K - ATPase activity of cofilin S3A - BFP - transfected cells was decreased ( Fig . 5 A ) . To determine whether Na , K - ATPase activity is dependent on glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation , we employed IAA , a relatively specific irreversible inhibitor of glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase , and CCCP , a protonophore oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor ( Fig . 5 A ) . In mock , cofilin - BFP , and cofilin S3A - BFP - transfected cells , Na , K - ATPase activity was decreased significantly ( to 0 – 5 % ) in the presence of IAA ( Fig . 5 A ) . However , in the presence of CCCP , mock and cofilin - BFP - transfected cells exhibited slightly increased Na , K - ATPase activity , and cofilin S3A - BFP - transfected cells exhibited slightly lower activity ( Fig . 5 A ) . As suggested by Okamoto et al . ( 37 ) , the slight increase in Na , K - ATPase activity in mock and cofilin - BFP - transfected cells pro - duced by CCCP may be caused by a compensatory increase in glycolysis . These data suggest that glycolysis , but not oxidative phosphorylation , is effective in providing ATP to Na , K - ATPase , through a process that requires the phosphorylated cofilin . The studies described in Fig . 5 A were also performed after treatment with LPA and Y - 27632 . As expected , after LPA treatment , Na , K - ATPase activity of mock - , cofilin - BFP - , and cofilin S3A - BFP - transfected cells increased to 142 , 180 , and 80 % , respectively , ( Fig . 5 B ) . However , after LPA treatment , Na , K - ATPase activity in all three transfected cells remarkably decreased in the presence of IAA but was almost unaffected in the presence of CCCP ( Fig . 5 B ) . Y - 27632 treatment caused , in all three transfected cells , decreases in Na , K - ATPase activity , which was decreased further by IAA and unaffected by CCCP ( Fig . 5 C ) . These results indicate again that glycolytic ATP is required for Na , K - ATPase activity and that the glycolytic fuel is supplied by the phosphorylated cofilin via a Rho - mediated signaling pathway . Cofilin Changes the Intracellular Sodium Concentration via a Rho - mediated Signaling Pathway— Because Na , K - ATPase is reported to be involved in the extrusion of intracellular sodium , we wondered whether phosphorylation of cofilin , which regu - lates this enzyme , also affects the intracellular sodium concen - tration [ Na (cid:3) ] i . To check this out , we performed flow cytometry experiments ( FACS ) using the cell - permeable sodium - binding fluorescent indicator , sodium green , and measured the [ Na (cid:3) ] i ( Fig . 6 ) . FACS of HeLa cells in the presence of LPA showed a remarkable decrease in the intracellular sodium of a popula - tion of cells , probably through the increased Na , K - ATPase ac - tivity ( Fig . 6 A ) . On the other hand , FACS showed little change in the intracellular sodium concentration in the presence of Y - 27632 ( Fig . 6 A ) . These results suggest that sodium transport to outside of the cells may be facilitated by the activation of Rho signaling , which presumably phosphorylates cofilin and acti - vates sodium activity . We also tested whether [ Na (cid:3) ] i is affected by a glycolytic pathway or oxidative pathway , using specific inhibitors of IAA and CCCP ( Fig . 6 B ) . As expected , in the presence of IAA , the population of cells that have an increased [ Na (cid:3) ] i was increased , whereas in the presence of CCCP , there was no difference from the control ( Fig . 6 B ) . These results suggest that a glycolytic pathway , rather than an oxidative pathway , provides the en - ergy demands for Na , K - ATPase activity . To clarify the relationship between glycolytic energy fuel and cofilin , in the context of its regulation by a Rho - mediated sig - naling pathway , we treated HeLa cells with LPA and Y - 27632 as well as IAA and CCCP , as described in ouabain - sensitive 86 Rb (cid:3) uptake experiments ( Fig . 6 C ) . As expected , in the pres - ence of IAA , the population of cells that had an increase in [ Na (cid:3) ] i was increased by pretreatment with either LPA or Y - 27632 ( Fig . 6 C ) . However , both in the absence and presence of CCCP , [ Na (cid:3) ] i decreased after pretreatment with LPA but increased after pretreatment of Y - 27632 ( Fig . 6 C ) . Taken to - gether , these results suggest that Rho and ROCK play an important role in the regulation of [ Na (cid:3) ] i probably through the phosphorylation of cofilin . F IG . 5 . Activation of Rho by LPA increases Na , K - ATPase ac - tivity , and inhibition of glycolysis by IAA decreases Na , K - ATPase activity . A , HeLa cells were transiently transfected with cofilin - BFP or cofilin S3A . After serum starvation , the cells were incubated with 1 m M ouabain for 15 min and treated with 50 (cid:2) M IAA or 0 . 1 (cid:2) M CCCP for 30 min . 86 Rb (cid:3) uptake was accomplished by adding of 2 (cid:2) Ci / ml 86 Rb (cid:3) and counted in triplicate . B , HeLa cells were treated as described above except for treatment with 10 (cid:2) M LPA before 50 (cid:2) M IAA or 0 . 1 (cid:2) M CCCP treatment . C , HeLa cells were treated as described above except for treatment with 10 (cid:2) M Y - 27632 before 50 (cid:2) M IAA or 0 . 1 (cid:2) M CCCP treatment .

Cofilin and TPI Complex Functions as Glycolytic ATP Feeder 48935 by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 28 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m DISCUSSION This study demonstrated the following : ( a ) cofilin is phospho - rylated by LPA through the Rho signaling cascade , Rho / ROCK / LIM kinase ; ( b ) both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated cofilin S interacts with TPI ; ( c ) phosphorylated cofilin com - plexed with TPI is translocated to the plasma membrane and becomes associated with Na , K - ATPase ; and ( d ) the TPI - glyco - lytic enzyme complex feeds glycolytic fuel to Na , K - ATPase . In Fig . 7 , we propose a pathway for Na , K - ATPase regulation by the cofilin - TPI complex in HeLa cells . The two major sources of ATP in the cells are aerobic glycol - ysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation . It is believed that oxidative ATP supports the mechanical activity of the cell , whereas glycolytic ATP fuels energy for membrane functions ( 38 ) . Indeed , many membrane proteins such as the ATP - sensi - tive K (cid:3) channel , Ca 2 (cid:3) pump , Na , K - ATPase , and L - type Ca 2 (cid:3) channel , are known to use glycolytic ATP preferentially rather than oxidative ATP ( 39 ) . Recently , direct binding of the glyco - lytic enzyme aldolase to a proton pump was demonstrated ( 40 ) . In the present work , we demonstrated that a glycolytic enzyme , TPI , associates indirectly with the large cytoplasmic domain of the sodium pump through phosphorylated cofilin . Our previous F IG . 7 . Proposed mechanism for Na , K - ATPase regulation . Co - filin is phosphorylated by LPA through the Rho signaling cascade , Rho / ROCK / LIM kinase , and both dephosphorylated cofilin and phos - phorylated cofilin S interact with TPI . The phosphorylated cofilin - TPI complex is translocated to the plasma membrane and becomes associ - ated with Na , K - ATPase . At the same time , TPI forms a glycolytic enzyme minicomplex feeding glycolytic fuels to Na , K - ATPase . F IG . 6 . Activation of Rho by LPA de - creases the intracellular sodium con - centration , and inhibition of glycoly - sis by IAA increases the intracellu - lar sodium concentration . A , serum - starved HeLa cells were treated with 10 (cid:2) M LPA or 10 (cid:2) M Y - 27632 for 30 min and trypsinized . Then the cells were loaded with sodium green tetraacetate ( final con - centration , 8 (cid:2) M ) . After incubation for 30 min , cells were washed with PBS three times and analyzed on a flow cytometer . The data were transformed into density plots and histograms using CellQuest software . B , serum - starved HeLa cells were treated with 50 (cid:2) M IAA or 0 . 1 (cid:2) M CCCP for 30 min and analyzed as de - scribed above . C , serum - starved HeLa cells were treated with LPA or Y - 27632 before treatment with IAA or CCCP and analyzed as described above . These data represent the averages of at least three independent experiments . Cofilin and TPI Complex Functions as Glycolytic ATP Feeder 48936 by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 28 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m demonstration , employing a yeast two - hybrid assay , that the large cytoplasmic domains of glucose transporter 1 , glucose transporter 4 , cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance reg - ulator , and plasma membrane Ca - ATPase did not interact with cofilin ( 41 ) suggests that the interaction with cofilin may not be a general phenomenon for feeding glycolytic fuels to the trans - membrane proteins . Thus , it appears that glycolytic energy for the membrane function is provided via two different mecha - nisms , namely , one involving direct interaction of a plasma membrane protein such as a proton pump with glycolytic en - zymes , and the other involving indirect interaction of a plasma membrane protein such as a sodium pump with glycolytic en - zyme via cofilin mediator . It has been shown that glycolytic enzymes such as aldolase and glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase interact directly with structural proteins such as actin and microtubules , whereas TPI binds indirectly ( 30 , 42 , 43 ) . Previously , we identified , in yeast two - hybrid screening studies , both TPI and cofilin as binding part - ners of the (cid:4) subunit of Na , K - ATPase . However , when TPI was reintroduced into transformants containing Na , K - ATPase , the in - teraction was not reproducible , suggesting that TPI does not bind directly to Na , K - ATPase ( data not shown ) . The present study , dem - onstrating that cofilin interacts with TPI and that this interaction is not dependent on the phosphorylation of cofilin , suggests that both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated cofilin can bind to TPI . Thus , it seems that TPI interacts indirectly , through phosphoryl - ated cofilin with Na , K - ATPase , and through dephosphorylated co - filin , with structural proteins . Dephosphorylated cofilin is essential to actin dynamics . It becomes inactive through phosphorylation at serine 3 residue , in a process regulated by LIM kinase ( 22 – 25 ) . Phosphorylation of LIM kinase depends on several small GTPase signaling cascades , known as Rho / ROCK and Rac or Cdc42 / Pak se - quences ( 22 – 25 , 44 ) . Although the signaling pathway for cofilin phosphorylation is well defined , the function of the inactive form of the phosphorylated cofilin has not been clear until now . The present study is the first demonstration that the phospho - rylated cofilin functions as a glycolytic ATP feeder for the ATP - hydrolyzing sodium pump . Rho is an important signaling element that regulates the cytoskeleton and interacts with other small GTPases , as well as other signaling elements , to regulate various cell functions ( 45 , 46 ) . In the present study , we observed that Rho is involved in the regulation of intracellular sodium , probably through Na , K - ATPase activation , which requires the phosphorylated cofilin and TPI complex . Rho also stimulates Na (cid:3) / H (cid:3) ex - changer activity through ROCK , and activation of the Na (cid:3) / H (cid:3) exchanger requires the glycolytic ATP ( 47 – 49 ) . Because both Na , K - ATPase and the Na (cid:3) / H (cid:3) exchanger are involved in the regulation of sodium homeostasis , Rho also may play an im - portant role in the maintenance of intracellular sodium . In summary , we have described studies indicating how gly - colytic enzymes are associated with the plasma membrane and what role they play in supporting ion pump activity in relative isolation from other metabolic enzyme cascades . The advan - tage of this system would be that the noted close juxtaposition and the functional coupling of energy producing system and energy - consuming enzymes may allow a fast and efficient ad - aptation of metabolic flow to fluctuating cellular conditions .
