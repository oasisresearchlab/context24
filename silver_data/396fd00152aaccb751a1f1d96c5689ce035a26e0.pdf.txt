We now ﬁnd that actin , bound to the surface of puriﬁed yeast vacuoles in the absence of cytosol or cytoskeleton , regulates the last compartment mixing stage of homotypic vacuole fusion . The Cdc42p GTPase is known to be required for vacuole fusion . We now show that proteins of the Cdc42p - regulated actin remodeling cascade ( Cdc42p → Cla4p → Las17p / Vrp1p → Arp2 / 3 complex → actin ) are enriched on isolated vacuoles . Vacuole fusion is dramatically altered by perturbation of the vacuole - A bound actin , either by mutation of the ACT1 gene , addition of speciﬁc actin ligands such as latrunculin B or jasplakinolide , antibody to the actin regulatory proteins Las17p ( yeast Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ) or Arp2 / 3 , or deletion of actin regulatory genes . On docked vacuoles , actin is enriched at the “vertex ring” membrane microdomain where fusion occurs and is required for the terminal steps leading to membrane fusion . This role for actin may extend to other trafﬁcking systems . Introduction Proteins are sorted by selective vesicular traffic ( Jahn and Sudhof , 1999 ) . The membrane fusion stage of trafficking is unexpectedly complex . It requires the coordinated action of chaperones ( such as NSF and (cid:2) - SNAP ) , SNAREs , GTPases ( Rab and Rho families ) , lipids ( steroid and phosphoinositides ) , and regulated calcium fluxes . Actin has a central role in several trafficking events ( Qualmann et al . , 2000 ; Foti et al . , 2001 ; Goode and Rodal , 2001 ; Lechler et al . , 2001 ) . Actin filaments are required for the transport and spatial targeting of secretory proteins ( Pruyne et al . , 1998 ; Guo et al . , 2001 ) , organelle inheritance during cell division ( Catlett and Weisman , 2000 ) , and the maintenance of Golgi structure ( Mullholland et al . , 1997 ; Valderrama et al . , 1998 ) . In different systems , membrane fusion has been shown to be promoted by stabilization of F - actin ( Koffer et al . , 1990 ; Jahraus et al . , 2001 ) , F - actin disassembly ( Vitale et al . , 1991 ; Muallem et al . , 1995 ) , or actin remodeling , i . e . , disassembly plus reassembly ( Bernstein et al . , 1998 ; Lang et al . , 2000 ) . Actin remodeling also accompanies synaptic stimulation ( Colicos et al . , 2001 ) . Actin ligands can modulate phagosome – endosome fusion in vitro ( Jahraus et al . , 2001 ) , and actin binds to purified endosomal and lysosomal vesicles , an association which can nucleate actin polymerization ( Mehrabian et al . , 1984 ; Taunton , 2001 ) . Actin and myosin V are involved directly in vacuole movement into the bud during cell division ( Hill et al . , 1996 ; Catlett et al . , 2000 ) . Rho - GTPases regulate actin rearrangement ( Hall , 1998 ) by signaling to multiple downstream effector complexes such as the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASp ) * and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Higgs and Pollard , 1999 ) . In each of these studies , it was assumed that the relevant actin molecules are cytosolic or cytoskeletal , though none of the data precludes a role for organelle - bound actin . We study membrane fusion with vacuoles from Saccharo - myces cerevisiae ( Wickner and Haas , 2000 ) . Purified yeast vacuoles undergo homotypic fusion in simple buffers containing ATP . All of the proteins and lipids needed for fusion are bound to the vacuole membrane . The reaction occurs in three stages termed priming , docking , and fusion . Priming , initiated by the ATPase Sec18p , releases Sec17p ( Mayer et al . , 1996 ) and disassembles a cis complex of SNAREs ( Ungermann et al . , 1998a ) . Priming liberates the “HOPS” complex ( for homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting ) / VPS class C complex ( Sato et al . , 2000 ; Seals et al . , 2000 ) , which then associates with GTP - bound Ypt7p to initiate docking ( Price et al . , 2000 ) . Completion of docking requires SNAREs ( Ungermann et al . , 1998b ) , the vacuole membrane potential ( Ungermann et al . , 1999 ) , phosphoinositides ( Mayer et al . , Address correspondence to William Wickner , Dept . of Biochemistry , Dartmouth Medical School , 7200 Vail Bldg . , Hanover , NH 03755 - 3844 .

Docking culminates in a transient release of vacuole lumenal calcium ( Peters and Mayer , 1998 ) . Calcium activates calmodulin , which binds to the V 0 domain of the vacuolar ATPase , triggering the for - mation of trans - pairs of V 0 plus the t - SNARE Vam3p , lead - ing to organelle fusion ( Peters et al . , 2001 ) . Two Rho - GTPases which are required for vacuole fusion , Cdc42p and Rho1p ( Eitzen et al . , 2001 ; Müller et al . , 2001 ) , can regulate actin structure ( Pringle et al . , 1995 ; Hel - liwell et al . , 1998 ) through a well - studied cascade which in - cludes Las17p / Bee1p ( yeast WASp ) and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 1 ) . A recent screen of a library of yeast strains with de - fined gene deletions ( Seeley et al . , 2002 ) suggested that this cascade of actin regulatory genes is needed to maintain nor - mal vacuole structure . We now report that the proteins of this regulatory cascade , from Cdc42p to Las17p and Arp2 / 3p , and actin itself , are found on purified yeast vacuoles , are essential for fusion , and allow actin action at the final stage of the fusion pathway . This role of actin in vacuole fusion may extend to other membrane fusion events . Results Cdc42p , a Rho - GTPase which regulates actin structure , is required for vacuole fusion and normal vacuole copy num - ber in vivo ( Eitzen et al . , 2001 ; Müller et al . , 2001 ) . These studies showed that the fusion of purified vacuoles was blocked by antibodies to Cdc42p and that vacuoles which were isolated from strains with temperature - sensitive Cdc42p were thermolabile for fusion . Fig . 1 depicts a schematic pathway in which Cdc42p and phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bis - phosphate ( PI [ 4 , 5 ] P2 ) govern a regulatory cascade which controls actin remodeling . Genetic ( Seeley et al . , 2002 ) and biochemical ( Mayer et al . , 2000 ) data show that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 is required for vacuole fusion , possibly as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42p ( Zheng et al . , 1996 ) or an acti - vating ligand for Las17p .

The width of the field shown in each of the nine panels is 25 (cid:4) m . ( B ) Immunoblot analysis of vacuoles and whole cell lysate prepared from strain GEY6024 for actin , actin signaling proteins ( Vrp1p , Las17p , Arp3p , Cla4p , and Cdc42p ) , vacuolar proteins ( Ypt7p and CPY ) , and a cytosolic chaperone ( Ssa1p ) . on M a y 17 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 12 , 2002 Actin - regulated vacuole fusion | Eitzen et al . 671 Vrp1p , also binds directly to Las17p ( Madania et al . , 1999 ; Lechler et al . , 2001 ; Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2001 ) . Las17p and Vrp1p regulate actin remodeling through activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Winter et al . , 1999 ; Evangelista et al . , 2000 ) . Because actin and its regulatory proteins might affect vacuole structure either directly or indirectly through altered endocytic or biosynthetic protein and lipid delivery to the vacuole , we have characterized their presence and functions on the purified organelle . In accord with the finding that isolated vacuoles bear Cdc42p ( Müller et al . , 2001 ) , we find that Cla4p , Vrp1p , Las17p , Arp3p , and actin itself are present on purified vacuoles ( Fig . 2 B ) at levels which meet or exceed their concentration in the whole cell . However , only a small portion of the total cellular complement of Myo5p , Arp2p , Arc18p , Sac2p , or Sac6p or when point mu - tations are introduced into actin ( Fig . 2 A ) . Vacuoles are also fragmented in the las17 – 16 strain , which contains a COOH - terminal 21 amino acid truncation that removes the Arp2 / 3 activation domain of Las17p ( Fig . 2 A ) ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ) . Each of these proteins directly modulates actin structure or its assembly ( Adams et al . , 1989 ; Higgs and Pol - lard , 1999 , 2000 ; Vaduva et al . , 1999 ; Evangelista et al . , 2000 ; Prehoda et al . , 2000 ; Rozelle et al . , 2000 ) . Cla4p , a p20 - activated kinase ( PAK ) , is a downstream effector of Cdc42p ( Gladfetter et al . , 2001 ; Mosch et al . , 2001 ) . Cla4p modifies Myo3p and Myo5p ( Lechler et al . , 2000 ) , which interact with Las17p / Bee1p , the yeast homologue of WASp ( Madania et al . , 1999 ; Lechler et al . , 2000 ) . Yeast verprolin , Figure 3 . Actin regulatory proteins are required for vacuole fusion . ( A ) Las17p antibodies inhibit vacuole fusion . Standard fusion reactions were incubated at 27 (cid:5) C in the presence of increasing concentrations of anti - LAS17 peptide antibodies ( left ) or anti - YPT7 peptide antibodies ( right ) that were either untreated ( (cid:2) ) or were immunodepleted by incubation with immobilized LAS17 peptide ( (cid:6) ) or immobilized YPT7 peptide ( (cid:3) ) ( as described in Materials and methods ) . Titration curves for immuno - depleted samples were normalized by volume to the nonimmunodepleted samples . ( B ) Las17p antibody no longer inhibits after docking . Standard fusion reactions ( 7 (cid:6) ) were first incubated with either 50 (cid:4) g / ml anti - Sec18p , 64 (cid:4) g / ml anti - Ypt7 antibodies , or 3 . 5 mM BAPTA for 30 , 35 , or 45 min , respectively . Sec18p ( 10 (cid:4) g / ml ) , Ypt7p peptide ( 30 (cid:4) g / ml ) , or 4 mM calcium was then added to reverse these blocks , and aliquots ( 30 (cid:4) l ) were immediately distributed into tubes containing the indicated second inhibitors and incubated at 27 (cid:5) C ( lanes 2 – 7 ) or on ice ( lane 1 ) for 90 min total . ( C ) Bypass of Las17p function . Fusion reactions with 8 (cid:4) g / ml IB2 and 1 (cid:4) g / ml Sec18p were incubated with increasing concentrations of anti - Las17 antibodies in the presence or absence of 1 mg / ml calmodulin , 0 . 5 mg / ml GST , 0 . 5 mg / ml GST – WCA , or 0 . 5 mg / ml GST – CA . ( D ) Arp3p antibodies inhibit vacuole fusion . Standard fusion reactions were incubated with an increasing amount of NH 2 - and COOH - terminal Arp3p antibodies which had been dialyzed into PS buffer and used directly or heat denatured by incubation at 95 (cid:5) C for 5 min . on M a y 17 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 12 , 2002 672 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 158 , Number 4 , 2002 these proteins is vacuolar , since this organelle comprises (cid:2) 1 / 30th of the cell protein . Actin on the vacuole is thus accom - panied by at least a proportionate amount of its normal reg - ulatory proteins , even though both actin and its regulatory proteins , such as Las17p and Arp2 / 3 complex , are largely found in cytoplasmic cables and plasma membrane patches ( Winter et al . , 1999 ) . To test the role of these proteins in vacuole fusion , we pre - pared an antibody to a peptide from the NH 2 - terminal re - gion of Las17p . We assay homotypic fusion of vacuoles by mixing vacuoles from two strains ( Wickner and Haas , 2000 ) . One strain has normal vacuolar lumenal proteases but is de - leted for the gene encoding the Pho8p phosphatase . The other strain is deleted for the vacuolar lumenal protease Pep4p and therefore accumulates catalytically inactive pro - Pho8p . During incubation with ATP , fusion allows the Pep4p protease to gain access to pro - Pho8p , yielding mature , active phosphatase which is assayed colorimetrically . Vacuole fusion is inhibited by antibodies to Las17p ( Fig . 3 A , left , No depletion ) . The inhibitory antibodies can be specifically de - pleted by beads bearing the immobilized peptide to which the antibodies were raised ( Fig . 3 A , left , compare depletion by immobilized LAS17 peptide with YPT7 peptide ) . Reversible inhibitors of the vacuole fusion reaction allow us to determine the last reaction stage that is sensitive to anti - Las17p antibodies ( Fig . 3 B ) . Staging experiments were performed with three reversible inhibitors : antibodies to the priming catalyst Sec18p , antibodies to the docking catalyst Ypt7p , or the fusion inhibitor BAPTA . Incubation of vacu - oles with anti - Sec18p antibodies prevents priming . The fu - sion reaction pathway resumes when excess Sec18p is added ( Fig . 3 B , top , lane 2 ) . This reaction remains sensitive to Figure 4 . Actin mutations impair vacuole fusion . ( A ) Vacuoles isolated from strains bearing wild - type actin ( GEY0394 / 0398 ) , act1 – 157 ( GEY0394 – 157 / 0398 – 157 ) , or act1 – 101 ( GEY0394 – 101 / 0398 – 101 ) were tested for fusion in the absence of additional soluble components ( None ) or in the presence of IB2 , calmodulin , Sec18p , P . C . ( IB2 , Sec18p , and Cmd1p ) , or cytosol ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) . ( B ) Standard fusion reac - tions of ACT1 or act1 – 157 vacuoles are blocked by inhibitors of the normal fusion pathway . ( C ) Immunoblot analysis of purified vacuoles ( 5 (cid:4) g / lane ) isolated from strain GEY0394 ( ACT 1 ) or the actin mutant strains GEY0394 – 157 ( act1 – 157 ) , and GEY0394 – 101 ( act1 – 101 ) . ( D ) Immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates ( 30 (cid:4) g / lane ) from the strains in C . on M a y 17 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 12 , 2002 Actin - regulated vacuole fusion | Eitzen et al . 673 anti - Las17p antibodies ( Fig . 3 B , top , lane 7 ) , showing that Las17p is required for the normal fusion reaction pathway . Vacuoles undergo priming in fusion reactions incubated with anti - YPT7 peptide antibodies , since upon reversal of this block with excess YPT7 peptide , fusion reactions are re - sistant to anti - Sec17p antibodies ( Fig . 3 B , middle , compare lane 2 with 3 ) . At this stage , docking is incomplete , since af - ter reversal of the anti - YPT7 block , reactions remain sensi - tive to either Gdi1p / Gyp7p ( Fig . 3 B , middle , lane 4 ) , which extracts Ypt7p ( Eitzen et al . , 2000 ) , antibody to the t - SNARE Vam3p ( Fig . 3 B , middle , lane 5 ) , or the calcium chelator BAPTA ( Fig . 3 B , middle , lane 6 ) . The reaction also remains sensitive to anti - Las17p antibodies after reversal of the anti - YPT7 block ( Fig . 3 B , middle , lane 7 ) . In the presence of BAPTA , vacuoles complete docking but do not fuse ( Peters and Mayer ; 1998 ; Ungermann et al . , 1999 ) . Upon reversal of the BAPTA block with calcium , vacuoles complete fusion ( Fig . 3 B , bottom , lane 2 ) . At this stage , re - actions are no longer sensitive to inhibitors of priming and docking ( Fig . 3 B , bottom , lanes 3 – 5 ) or to anti - Las17p an - tibodies ( Fig . 3 B , bottom , lane 7 ) . Readdition of BAPTA ( Fig . 3 B , bottom , lane 6 ) or incubation on ice ( Fig . 3 B , bottom , lane 1 ) inhibits fusion . These data suggest that Las17p , which helps initiate actin polymerization , may only be needed until docking is complete , but do not specify the reaction stage where actin functions to promote fusion . The sensitivity of vacuole fusion to antibody to an NH 2 - terminal region of Las17p is partially suppressed by the ad - dition of pure recombinant WCA domain of Las17p ( Fig . 3 C ) . The COOH - terminal WCA domain of Las17p stimu - lates the Arp2 / 3 complex in yeast and higher eukaryotes ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Winter et al . , 1999 ) . We also found that addition of the CA domain partially suppresses anti - Las17p inhibition , although less efficiently than the WCA domain ( Fig . 3 C ) . Whereas the CA domain of WASp acts as a dominant - negative inhibitor in mammalian extracts ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ) , the CA domain of yeast stimulates Arp2 / 3 function , though less efficiently than WCA ( Winter et al . , 1999 ) . The reaction sensitivity to anti - Las17p is also suppressed by the addition of calmodulin ( Fig . 3 C ) , in ac - cord with the finding that calmodulin activates the Arp2 / 3 complex , which is a downstream effector of Las17p / WASp ( Schaerer - Brodbeck and Riezman , 2000a ) . Thus , actin re - modeling may be at least one of the functions of calmodulin in vacuole fusion . Calmodulin also regulates many other cel - lular processes and specifically associates with the vacuolar Vtc complex ( Müller et al . , 2002 ) ; further studies will be needed to establish its full range of functions in vacuole fu - sion . We also used commercially available Arp3p antibodies to directly test the requirement of the Arp2 / 3 complex in our reaction . An antibody to an NH 2 - terminal domain of Arp3p antibody inhibits vacuole fusion , whereas antibody to the COOH - terminal domain of Arp3 or heat - denatured an - tibodies do not inhibit ( Fig . 3 D ) . These biochemical studies complement the genetic results ( Fig . 2 A ) and indicate that the pathway from Cdc42p through Las17p to the Arp2 / 3 complex regulates vacuole fusion . Therefore , we sought di - rect tests of the role of actin itself in vacuole fusion . Actin mutations affect vacuole fusion Several actin mutants were examined for their vacuole mor - phology in vivo . Strains bearing the act1 – 101 allele have fragmented vacuoles , whereas strains bearing the act1 – 157 allele have abnormally large , lobed vacuoles ( Fig . 2 A ) . Puri - fied vacuoles from these strains , when incubated in vitro without added cytosolic proteins , are strikingly defective for Figure 5 . Actin ligands inhibit vacuole fusion . ( A ) Inhibition of vacuole fusion by latrunculin B and jasplakinolide . Drugs were added to standard fusion reactions . ( B ) Standard vacuole fusion reactions were arrested while undocked by incubation with 64 (cid:4) g / ml Ypt7 antibodies or when docked ( but not fused ) by incubation with 3 . 5 mM BAPTA for 35 or 45 min , respectively . The indicated second inhibitors were added after reversal of the initial blocks by the addition of either 30 (cid:4) g / ml YPT7 peptide or 4 mM calcium , respectively . ( C ) Kinetic analysis of inhibition by latrunculin B . A large standard fusion reaction was incubated at 27 (cid:5) C . At various times , 30 - (cid:4) l aliquots were placed on ice ( defining the fusion curve ) or added to tubes containing anti - Sec18p antibodies ( priming curve ) , anti - Ypt7p antibodies ( docking curve ) , or latrunculin B ( 300 (cid:4) M final concentration ) , and further incubated at 27 (cid:5) C for 90 min total . on M a y 17 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 12 , 2002 674 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 158 , Number 4 , 2002 in vitro fusion when compared with their isogenic ACT1 counterparts ( Fig . 4 A , lanes 1 – 3 ) . Though we have not found conditions which allow fusion of vacuoles from the act1 – 101 strain , fusion is restored to act1 – 157 vacuoles when given cytosol ( lane 17 ) or a mixture of the purified chaperone IB2 ( Slusarewicz et al . , 1997 ) , calmodulin , and Sec18p ( lane 14 ) , a mixture which we term “pure compo - nents” ( P . C . ) . This agrees well with the failure of in vivo fu - sion of act1 – 101 vacuoles but a fused , albeit abnormal , structure of act1 – 157 vacuoles ( Fig . 2 A ) . These P . C . which stimulate salt - washed vacuoles ( Ungermann et al . , 1999 ) , also show some stimulation of wild - type ( ACT1 ) vacuole fu - sion ( Fig . 4 A , compare lane 1 with 13 ) , but only act1 – 157 vacuoles exhibit complete P . C . dependence ( Fig . 4 A , com - pare lane 2 with 14 ) . This fusion is sensitive to normal fu - sion inhibitors ( Fig . 4 B ) . Immunoblot analysis was performed on purified vacuoles from ACT1 , act1 – 157 , or act1 – 101 strains ( Fig . 4 C ) . Vacuoles from actin mutant strains have normal levels of bound proteins such as actin , calmodulin , Sec18p , Nyv1p ( v - SNARE ) , Ypt7p ( the vacuolar Rab ) , and Vps39p ( a subunit of HOPS ) , and lumenal carboxypepti - dase Y , showing that they are of substantially normal com - position . However , the act1 – 101 mutation causes a striking deficiency in vacuolar Cla4p , Vrp1p , Las17p , and Arp3p , though these proteins are present at normal levels in total cell extracts ( Fig . 4 D ) . The inability of even cytosol to res - cue the fusion of vacuoles from act1 – 101 strains ( Fig . 4 A , lane 18 ) may reflect this striking loss of actin regulatory pro - teins . There was also a modest diminution of vacuolar Vam3p levels ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) , which may contribute to the fusion defect of these vacuoles . Actin ligands block vacuole fusion Latrunculin B and jasplakinolide bind to yeast actin mono - mers or filaments , respectively ( Ayscough 2000 ; Morton et al . , 2000 ) . These drugs inhibit vacuole fusion ( Fig . 5 A ) . As for anti - Las17p ( Fig . 3 B ) , reversible reaction inhibitors were used to determine the stage at which the reaction becomes resistant to latrunculin B or jasplakinolide ( Fig . 5 B ) . Vacu - oles were allowed to prime in the presence of an antibody to a peptide from the Ypt7p sequence ( Eitzen et al . , 2001 ) . Upon addition of excess YPT7 peptide to neutralize the an - tibody , the subsequent docking and fusion ( Fig . 5 B , top , lane 2 ) remained sensitive to added jasplakinolide or latrun - culin B ( Fig . 5 B , top , lanes 6 and 7 ) . In a parallel incuba - tion , vacuoles were allowed to complete docking in the pres - ence of the fusion inhibitor BAPTA . Upon reversal of the BAPTA block , the vacuoles went on to fuse when incubated at 27 (cid:5) C ( Fig . 5 B , bottom , lane 2 ) . Fusion was no longer sensitive to Gdi1p / Gyp7p or anti - Vam3p antibodies , though these blocked the reaction completely if added from the start ( unpublished data ) , indicating that the vacuoles had com - pleted docking in the presence of BAPTA ( Peters and Mayer , 1998 ; Ungermann et al . , 1999 ) . Although latruncu - lin B still inhibited the fusion of these docked vacuoles ( Fig . 5 B , bottom , lane 7 ) , jasplakinolide did not ( Fig . 5 B , bot - tom , lane 6 ) . To verify that latrunculin acts as a late stage in - hibitor of vacuole fusion , its kinetics of inhibition were ex - amined . The drug was added to aliquots of a standard fusion reaction at various times , and each aliquot was further incu - bated for a total time of 90 min at 27 (cid:5) C . Latrunculin addi - tion yielded a kinetic curve of inhibition that was similar to samples placed on ice , which represents the membrane fu - sion curve ( Fig . 5 C ) . The curve of acquired resistance to la - trunculin B was well resolved from the kinetics of acquiring resistance to priming ( anti - Sec18p ) and docking ( anti - Ypt7p ) inhibitors . Together , these data suggest that actin remodeling , revealed by sensitivity of the vacuole fusion re - action to anti - Las17p or jasplakinolide , occurs during dock - ing , although the formation of F - actin from monomer , Figure 6 . Actin remodeling is not needed for Ypt7 - dependent docking . The quantitative microscopic assay of vacuole docking was performed as described ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) . Approximately 700 vacuoles were counted for each reaction , and the percentage of vacuoles in each cluster size was scored . Gdi1p ( 100 (cid:4) g / ml ) , jasplakinolide ( 250 (cid:4) M ) , and latruculin B ( 400 (cid:4) M ) were added as indicated . on M a y 17 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 12 , 2002 Actin - regulated vacuole fusion | Eitzen et al . 675 shown by latrunculin B sensitivity , is needed during mem - brane fusion . To determine whether actin remodeling is needed for docking itself or whether it is only needed during docking to allow subsequent fusion , we performed a quantitative micro - scopic assay of docking ( Mayer and Wickner , 1997 ; Wang et al . , 2002 ) . During our standard in vitro incubations , docking creates large clusters of five or more vacuoles ( Fig . 6 B ) . Docking requires ATP - dependent priming ( Fig . 6 A ) and is blocked by the extraction of Ypt7p by Gdi1p ( Fig . 6 C ) . Neither jasplakinolide nor latrunculin B , at concentra - tions which block the fusion reaction , inhibit the formation of docked vacuole clusters ( Fig . 6 , D and F ) , and docking re - mains sensitive to Gdi1p ( i . e . , Ypt7p dependent ) in the pres - ence of either drug ( Fig . 6 , E and G ) . Thus actin is needed for vacuole fusion rather than for docking , though the jas - plakinolide - sensitive aspects of actin remodeling occur dur - ing the docking reaction . Vertex enrichment of actin We have defined the membrane microdomains of docked vacuoles as outside ( not in contact with another vacuole ) , boundary ( apposed to another vacuole in a docked cluster ) , or vertex ( where boundary membranes , or outside and boundary membranes , meet ) . The vertices form a ring around the boundary membrane of adjacent vacuoles , and vacuole homotypic fusion occurs at this ring in vivo and in vitro ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) . Proteins which catalyze docking and fusion are enriched at these vertex rings , providing a mechanistic rationale for the observed vertex ring fusion pathway . Since actin is required for vacuole fusion , we tested whether it accumulates at the vertex rings of docked vacu - oles . Rhodamine - labeled rabbit muscle G - actin was added to vacuoles in the presence of the lipophilic dye MDY - 64 . When these vacuoles were clumped by cosedimentation ( Fig . 7 A , top ) , there was no apparent clustering of bound actin at any microdomain . However , when these vacuoles were incubated under authentic docking conditions ( Fig . 7 A , middle ) , actin bound selectively to the vertices as shown by ratiometric analysis of the two fluors . This vertex enrich - ment , like those seen for other docking and fusion factors ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) , is prevented when SNARE disassembly is blocked ( Wang et al . , 2000 ) by an added excess of Sec17p ( Fig . 7 A , bottom ) . A similar pattern of vertex - specific labeling was seen with vacuoles which formed docked clusters in the presence of Al - Figure 7 . Actin is enriched at the vertices of docked vacuoles . Purified vacuoles were either docked by the physiological Ypt7p - dependent pathway or clustered by cosedimentation as described in Wang et al . ( 2002 ) . ( A ) Rhodamine - actin ( 4 (cid:4) M , total rabbit muscle actin ) was added at the beginning of the reaction , or Alexa Fluor 488 – DNaseI ( 0 . 2 (cid:4) M ) was added to docked or cosedimented vacuoles ( B ) . After a 30 - min incubation at 27 (cid:5) C , vacuoles were fixed with 1 % formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature , sedimented at 3000 g for 2 min , resuspended in PS buffer , and subjected to microscopic analysis ( as described in Materials and methods ) . Ratiometric images of representative clusters are shown . ( C ) Cumulative distribution plots of the ratios of pixel values ( rhodamine : MDY - 64 lipid label ) obtained for each morphometric domain ( vertex , boundary , and outside edge midpoints ) and each treatment . Each curve represents an average of 410 individual ratio measurements on 110 – 115 vacuole clusters from three independent experiments . on M a y 17 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 12 , 2002 676 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 158 , Number 4 , 2002 exa Fluor 488 – labeled DNaseI ( Fig . 7 B ) . DNaseI binds se - lectively to actin and thus serves as a measure of the spatial distribution of vacuole - bound actin . Quantitation of the ratios of Alexa Fluor 488 – DNaseI to lipidic fluor was per - formed for the outside edge , boundary midpoints , and vertices of many vacuole clusters . Each ratio was plotted according to its percentile value in its cohort ( Fig . 7 C ) , showing that there is a clear enrichment of Alexa Fluor 488 – DNaseI – dec - orated actin at the vertices of vacuoles under authentic dock - ing conditions . Discussion Our studies show that vacuole - bound actin is needed for ho - motypic fusion of this organelle in the absence of cytoskele - ton or cytosol . Proteins of the well - established pathways of actin cytoskeleton regulation are needed for normal vacuole structure in vivo ( Fig . 2 A ) and are found on purified vacu - oles at levels which cannot be due to cytosolic contamina - tion ( Fig . 2 B ) . Antibody to the Las17p / Bee1p , the yeast WASp homologue , inhibits vacuole fusion ( Fig . 3 ) , and this inhibition can be modulated ( Fig . 3 C ) by high levels of ei - ther the WCA domain of Las17p or by calmodulin , which are known to interact directly with Arp2 / 3 complex . Anti - body to Arp3p itself also blocks vacuole fusion ( Fig . 3 D ) . Mutations in actin have striking effects on vacuole structure in vivo ( Fig . 2 A ) and fusion in vitro ( Fig . 4 ) , and well - stud - ied actin ligands ( Morton et al . , 2000 ) show fusion stage - specific inhibition of the vacuole fusion reaction ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) . We found that blocking F - actin depolymerization ( jas - plakinolide ) no longer inhibits vacuoles that have undergone docking ( BAPTA block ) , whereas blocking F - actin assembly with latrunculin B still prevents the final stage of membrane fusion ( Fig . 5 B ) . These results suggest that disassembly of actin , though not needed for docking , is required to produce fusion - competent docked vacuoles and that actin reassembly is needed for fusion . Thus Cdc42p may be essential for vac - uole fusion ( Eitzen et al . , 2001 ; Müller et al . , 2001 ) because it governs the state of vacuole - bound actin . Rho1p may even regulate vacuole fusion by controlling actin via a MAPK cas - cade ( Helliwell et al . , 1998 ) . Actin is required for other yeast trafficking reactions as well . However , it is unclear in these studies whether this reflects a need for actin cytoskeleton or for actin on the surface of or - ganelles . Actin is needed for mitochondrial motility ( Simon et al . , 1995 ) and inheritance ( Hermann et al . , 1997 ; Boldogh et al . , 2001 ) , vacuole inheritance ( Hill et al . , 1996 ) , and the po - larized delivery of secretory vesicles to the bud tip ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Mullholland et al . , 1997 ; Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) . Cdc42p regulates polarized exocytosis in yeast ( Pringle et al . , 1995 ; Zhang et al . , 2001 ) and controls actin polymer - ization through activation of Las17p and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Lechler et al . , 2001 ) . Cdc42p also interacts with proteins that mediate secretory vesicle docking and fusion in a manner that is independent of actin cytoskeleton ( Adamo et al . , 2001 ; Zhang et al . , 2001 ) . It is unclear though whether Cdc42p also controls actin - related organelle inheritance . Actin and its regulatory proteins are required for endocy - tosis in yeast ( Kubler and Riezman , 1993 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ; Geli and Riezman , 1996 ) and mammals ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ) . These actin regulatory proteins include Myo5p ( Geli et al . , 1998 ) , calmodulin ( Kubler et al . , 1994 ) , which is also needed for vacuole homotypic fusion ( Peters and Mayer , 1998 ) , Arc35p ( Schaerer - Brodbeck and Riezman , 2000b ) , a subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex , and Pan1p , which interacts with the endocytic machinery and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ) . Immunoblot analysis of purified vacuoles and whole cell lysate revealed an enrichment of actin regulatory proteins from Cdc42p to the Arp2 / 3 complex on the vacuole mem - brane ( Fig . 2 ) . Although the Arp2 / 3 complex or its sub - components have not previously been localized to the vacu - ole membrane , they have been found on other subcellular organelles such as the nucleus ( Weber et al . , 1995 ; Yan et al . , 1997 ) and the mitochondria ( Boldogh et al . , 2001 ) . We now show that these proteins , which are part of a well - stud - ied actin remodeling cascade ( Higgs and Pollard , 1999 ) , also regulate membrane fusion . Clearly the major site of Arp2 / 3 localization is cortical actin patches at the plasma mem - brane where it is involved in cell growth via regulation of vesicle delivery ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ; Lechler et al . , 2001 ) , though these studies did not preclude a continuing role in vesicle docking and membrane fusion . In addition to Arp3p and Las17p antibody inhibition , we also show that calmodulin and Las17p WCA domain , which are known to interact with and stimulate Arp2 / 3 function ( Winter et al . , 1999 ; Schaerer - Brodbeck and Riezman , 2000b ) , can stimulate membrane fusion of vacuoles which have been blocked by the addition of an NH 2 - terminal Las17p pep - tide antibody ( Fig . 3 C ) . Additionally , specific actin muta - tions cause the striking loss of vacuolar localization of sev - eral actin regulatory proteins , coincident with the inability of these vacuoles to fuse in vitro ( Fig . 4 C ) . These data thus establish a requirement for actin remodeling for vacuole fusion . Part of the functions of calmodulin and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 in vac - uole fusion may be the regulation of actin . Calmodulin me - diates the signal of docking - induced calcium release ( Peters and Mayer , 1998 ) . It interacts directly with the V o and Vtc complexes ( Peters et al . , 2001 ; Müller et al . , 2002 ) , Myo2p ( Cheney et al . , 1993 ; Brockerhoff et al . , 1994 ) , and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Schaerer - Brodbeck and Riezman , 2000b ) . Our current studies ( Fig . 3 C ) show that calmodulin can at least partially bypass the inhibition caused by antibody to Las17p . Genetic ( Seeley et al . , 2002 ) and biochemical ( Mayer et al . , 2000 ) data show that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 is required for vacuole fusion , perhaps in part to function as a guanine nu - cleotide exchange factor for Cdc42p ( Zheng et al . , 1996 ) or as an activating ligand for Las17p . PI ( 4 ) P 5 - kinase has been shown to govern actin polymerization in yeast ( Desrivieres et al . , 1998 ) and mammals ( Shibasaki et al . , 1997 ) . Although our combined genetic and biochemical data clearly show that actin has a central role in vacuole fusion , the regulation of this process and the mode of actin action are unknown . Actin structure is altered by overexpression of Nrf1p ( Murray and Johnson , 2000 ) , a protein which is di - rectly involved in vacuole fusion ( Müller et al . , 2002 ) and interacts genetically with Cdc42p ( Murray and Johnson , 2000 ) . Actin remodeling on the vacuole is regulated by the Cdc42p – Las17p – Arp2 / 3 cascade . Though Cdc42p action on M a y 17 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 12 , 2002 Actin - regulated vacuole fusion | Eitzen et al . 677 requires the prior activation of Ypt7p ( Eitzen et al . , 2001 ) , the mechanisms which connect these GTPases are unclear . Recently , we reported ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) that docked vacu - oles show selective accumulation of fusion proteins at a ring around the edge of their apposed membranes and that this ring is the site of membrane fusion . Vacuolar - bound actin is also enriched at these vertices during docking ( Fig . 7 ) . Ver - tex enrichment is a critical subreaction of membrane fusion ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) . Actin may contribute to this protein lo - calization and might distort or destabilize the bilayer mem - brane on each vacuole as a prerequisite to fusion itself . Materials and methods Yeast strains and genetic modifications Yeast strains are listed in Table I . The endogenous ACT1 gene was re - placed with the act1 – 101 and act1 – 157 mutant alleles or wild - type ACT1 ( including the downstream HIS3 gene ) by PCR amplification from strains DDY 338 , DDY1544 , and DDY354 , respectively ( Holtzman et al . , 1994 ; Belmont et al . , 1999 ) using primers TCTACTACATCAGCTTTTAG and GAAGGGCAATTGCATAAAC . Transformants were selected on SD - his ( Bio101 ) . Proper integration was checked by genomic DNA PCR using primers AATCTTTGTTAAAGAATAGG and CTAATGGCGGTTCTACAAG . In vivo vacuole morphology was examined by fluorescence microscopy after FM4 – 64 staining ( Seeley et al . , 2002 ) . Biochemical reagents Reagents were dissolved or dialyzed in PS buffer ( 20 mM PIPES - KOH , pH 6 . 8 , 200 mM sorbitol ) unless otherwise noted . Alexa Fluor 488 – DNaseI ( Molecular Probes ) was dissolved in PBS / 50 % glycerol at 166 (cid:4) M , and rhodamine - labeled rabbit actin ( a gift from Dr . H . Higgs , Dartmouth Med - ical School ) was a mixture of 30 (cid:4) M unlabeled actin and 10 (cid:4) M labeled actin . Jasplakinolide ( Molecular Probes ) and latrunculin B ( Biomol ) were dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM . Amino ( yG18 ) and carboxy ( yK17 ) Arp3p antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) were dialyzed into PS buffer . The following inhibitors were used at the final concentrations listed : affin - ity - purified anti - YPT7 peptide antibodies ( 50 (cid:4) g / ml ) , IgG fraction of anti - Las17 peptide antibodies ( 350 (cid:4) g / ml ) , affinity - purified anti - Sec18p anti - bodies ( 50 (cid:4) g / ml ) , anti - Vam3p IgG ( 150 (cid:4) g / ml ) , anti - Sec17p IgG ( 250 (cid:4) g / ml ) , Arp3p IgGs ( 300 (cid:4) g / ml ) , Gdi1p ( 100 (cid:4) g / ml ) , Gyp7p ( 30 (cid:4) g / ml ) , Rdi1p ( 500 (cid:4) g / ml ) , latrunculin B ( 400 (cid:4) M ) , jasplakinolide ( 250 (cid:4) M ) , and BAPTA ( 5 mM ) . Protein preparation Sec18p , Gyp7p , Gdi1p , Rdi1p , calmodulin ( Cmd ) 1p , and IB2 were prepared as described ( Brockerhoff et al . , 1992 ; Slusarewicz et al . , 1997 ; Eitzen et al . , 2001 ) . GST , GST – WCA , and GST – CA were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5 (cid:2) transformed with the vector pGEX - 4T1 ( Amersham Biosciences ) only or with vector containing in frame BamH1 – EcoR1PCR products encoding the COOH - terminal 125 ( WCA ) or 66 ( CA ) amino acids of Las17p . These proteins were prepared as described for Rdi1p ( Eitzen et al . , 2001 ) . Cytosol was prepared from strain K91 – 1A grown to an OD 600 (cid:2) 4 , lysed by vortexing 5 min with glass beads in lysis buffer ( 125 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM PIPES - KOH , pH 6 . 8 , 200 mM sorbitol , 1 mM ATP , 6 . 6 ng / ml leupeptin , 16 . 6 ng / ml pepstatin , 16 . 6 (cid:4) M o - phenanthroline , 3 . 3 (cid:4) M Pefabloc SC ) , and cleared by centrifugation ( 12 , 000 g for 10 min and then 150 , 000 g for 60 min at 4 (cid:5) C ) . Whole cell lysates were similarly prepared in lysis buffer from strains grown to an OD 600 (cid:2) 1 except that 1 % Triton X - 100 was added after glass bead vortexing and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 3 , 000 g for 4 min at 4 (cid:5) C . YPT7 and LAS17 peptide antibodies were raised against TEAFEDDYNDAINIRC and FEMEECFAGLLFVDINEASHC conjugated to KLH , respectively . These peptides ( 3 mg / ml resin ) and Sec18p ( 10 mg / ml resin ) were conjugated to Sulfolink resin ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . IgG fractions were prepared from sera by pro - tein A sepharose adsorption ( Harlow and Lane , 1988 ) . Immobilized peptides and protein were used for affinity purification and immunodepletion of anti - bodies . For immunodepletion experiments , IgGs ( 0 . 5 ml ) were incubated with 0 . 1 ml packed resin in PBS for 1 h at 4 (cid:5) C . Flow - through samples were saved as immunodepleted fractions . The resin was washed twice with 1 ml of PBS , and bound antibodies were eluted with 0 . 25 ml of 100 mM glycine - HCl , pH 2 . 5 . All samples were dialyzed into PS buffer . Standard vacuole fusion reactions Vacuoles were isolated from strains grown in YPD to an OD 600 (cid:2) 0 . 9 . Fu - sion reactions ( Haas , 1995 ) contain 3 (cid:4) g of vacuoles lacking proteinase A and 3 (cid:4) g of vacuoles lacking alkaline phosphatase in 30 (cid:4) l fusion reaction buffer ( FRB : 125 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM PIPES - KOH , pH 6 . 8 , 200 mM sorbitol , 1 mM ATP , 40 mM creatine phosphate , 0 . 5 mg / ml creatine kinase , 10 (cid:4) M CoA , 6 . 6 ng / ml leupeptin , 16 . 6 ng / ml pepstatin , 16 . 6 (cid:4) M o - phenanthroline , 3 . 3 (cid:4) M Pefabloc SC ) . Standard vacuole fusion reactions also contained P . C . ( 200 (cid:4) g / ml calmodulin , 8 (cid:4) g / ml IB2 , and 1 (cid:4) g / ml Sec18p ) . Reactions were incubated for 90 min at 27 (cid:5) C before assaying for alkaline phosphatase .

Reactions ( 30 (cid:4) l ) contain 5 (cid:4) g of vacu - oles ( from strain DKY6281 ) labeled with the lipophilic dye MDY - 64 ( 3 (cid:4) M ; Molecular Probes ) . At the end of the reaction , vacuoles were mixed with 40 (cid:4) l of 0 . 6 % agarose in PS buffer . Aliquots ( 15 (cid:4) l ) were then ob - served by fluorescence microscopy . Images were acquired with an Olym - pus BX51 microscope equipped with a 60 (cid:6) / 1 . 4 NA plan Apochromat ob - jective , 100 W Mercury arc lamp , and Cooke Sensicam QE CCD camera . The microscope and camera were controlled by IP lab software ( Scanalyt - ics ) . An Endow GFP filter cube ( Chroma Technology Corp . ) was used for rhodamine - actin and Alexa Fluor 488 – DNaseI .
