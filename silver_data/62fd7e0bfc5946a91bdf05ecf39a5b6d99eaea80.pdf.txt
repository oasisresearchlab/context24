REVI E W Open Access The fibrotic microenvironment as a heterogeneity facet of hepatocellular carcinoma Krista Rombouts 1 and Vinicio Carloni 2 * Abstract It has long been recognized that hepatocellular carcinoma heterogeneity arises from variation in the microenvironment or from genomic alteration . Only recently it has become clear that non - genetic alterations , such as cytoskeletal rearrangement , protein localization and formation of protein complexes , are also involved in generating phenotype variability . These proteome fluctuations cause genetically identical cells to vary significantly in their responsiveness to microenvironment stimuli . In the cirrhotic liver pre - malignant hepatocytes are continuously exposed to abnormal microenvironments , such as direct contact with activated hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) and extracellular matrix components . These abnormal environments can have pronounced influences on the epigenetic aspects of cells , translating into abnormal phenotypes . Here we discuss non - genetic causes of phenotypic heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma , with an emphasis on variability of membrane protein complexes and transferred functions raising important implications for diagnosis and treatment . Keywords : Liver cancer , Activated hepatic stellate cells ( HSC ) , Intra - tumor heterogeneity , Tetraspanin - enriched microdomains , Integrins Review Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and a significant in - crease in the incidence of HCC through the last two de - cades has been observed [ 1 ] . There are two prominent features in the development of HCC . First , 90 % of HCCs have chromosomal abnormalities and , second , the great majority of these tumors , regardless of aetiology , develop in cirrhotic livers , which are characterized by destruction of the hepatic lobular architecture and its replacement by nodules containing proliferative hepatocytes , in the presence of chronic inflammation and fibrosis [ 2 ] . A seminal feature of hepatocellular carcinoma is the ability to produce multiple subpopulations of cells with diverse genetic , biochemical and immunological charac - teristics [ 3 , 4 ] . How this heterogeneity emerges and how it is maintained is not clear [ 5 , 6 ] . Fluctuations in single cells can be masked or completely misrepresented when cell populations are analyzed . Therefore , intra - tumor heterogeneity may foster tumor evolution and adapta - tion and hinder personalized - medicine strategies that depend on results from imaging procedures or single tumor - biopsy samples [ 7 , 8 ] . Along these lines , it has be - come exceedingly apparent that the utility of measure - ments based on the analysis of bulk tumors is limited by intra - tumor genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity , as characteristics of the most abundant cell type might not necessarily predict the properties of the whole cell popu - lations [ 8 ] . Indeed , this aspect is supported by a recent report describing the presence of distinct diagnostic sig - natures derived from different biopsies of the same tumor [ 9 ] . Yet , such non - uniformities often unveil mo - lecular patterns that can represent mechanisms of tumor progression . More interestingly , variability among single cells in a population may arise from different responses to intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations coming from the abnormal microenvironment that may have pronounced influences on the epigenetic aspects of cells , translating into abnormal phenotypes [ 10 ] . Therefore , it is tantaliz - ing to hypothesize that normalization of the tumor microenvironment corresponds to the normalization of cellular phenotypes , and destabilization of normal tissue organization can translate into an increased risk of * Correspondence : vinicio . carloni @ unifi . it 2 Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine , Center for Research , Transfer and High Education , DENOthe , University of Florence , Largo Brambilla 3 , 50134 , Florence , Italy Full list of author information is available at the end of the article © 2013 Rombouts and Carloni ; licensee BioMed Central Ltd .

The great interest concerning the tumor microenvironment is associated with the recognition that micro - environ mental alterations are not just passive consequences of genetic evolution occurring in hepatocytes , but that they are active participants in tumorigenesis [ 13 ] . As many excellent reviews summarize progress in this area , we focus on the effects of micro - environmental alterations on the phenotypic heterogeneity of pre - malignant hepatocytes . Activated hepatic stellate cells Pre - malignant hepatocytes live in a complex micro - environment that includes the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , diffusible growth factors and cytokines , and a variety of non - epithelial cell types , including endothe - lial cells , activated hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) , and those that can respond to infection and injury , that is , lymphocytes , Kupffer cells - macrophages and mast cells [ 14 , 15 ] . HSCs are known as very important ECM - producing myofibroblasts dwelling in the cirrhotic liver and micro - environment of HCC . The activated HSCs infiltrate the stroma of liver tumors and localize around tumor sinu - soids , fibrous septa and capsules [ 16 , 17 ] . Activated HSCs increase the production and secretion of ECM proteins , which include collagens , laminins , fibronectin and heparan - sulphate proteoglycans . In this way , HSCs have a major impact on the ECM content of the micro - environment and also may affect the overall tumor stro - mal behavior and vice versa [ 18 ] . Indeed , several studies demonstrated that transformed hepatocytes stimulate migration of HSCs in culture , as well as their produc - tion of ECM components , when co - cultured , or when HCC tumor - conditioned medium was used [ 19 - 21 ] . Hence , all support the concept that hepatocarcinoma cells recruit HSCs , which then promote tumor growth and local invasion [ 22 ] . The cancer cell - induced in - crease in ECM synthesis is mediated by transforming growth factor beta ( TGF - β 1 ) , whereas proliferation of HSCs is promoted by platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) [ 23 , 24 ] . This interaction , between HCC and HSCs , is bidirectional since HSCs , in turn , stimulate hepatocarcinoma cell proliferation and inhibit their apoptosis to increase the population of cancer cells [ 25 ] . Proliferation of hepatocytes is mediated by factors secreted by activated HSCs , such as insulin - like growth factor I ( IGF - I ) , transforming growth factor alpha ( TGF - α ) , hep - atocyte growth factor ( HGF ) and other inflammatory cyto - kines [ 26 , 27 ] . Accumulating evidence indicates and points to an important and major influence of activated HSC on HCC development and progression and , hence , the thera - peutic inhibition of activated HSCs should be taken into account when treating HCC [ 28 ] . Premalignant and cancerous hepatocytes Hepatocyte plasma membrane microdomains , the tetraspanin paradigm It has long been recognized that differences from one cell to the next can arise through variation in the extra - cellular environment or from genomic alteration . Only recently it has become clear that plasma membrane pro - tein fluctuations can also have profound effects on phenotype . These fluctuations cause genetically identical cells to vary significantly in their responsiveness to stim - uli of the fibrotic microenvironment ( Figure 1 ) . The spatial organization of plasma membrane compo - nents in discrete microdomains is thought to be a key factor in the generation of distinct signal inputs or out - puts [ 29 ] . Dynamic microdomains have important impli - cations for understanding how signaling complexes are assembled and disassembled in response to ECM stim - uli ; some components of these signaling complexes might reside permanently in these microdomains , but others could have extremely transient interactions [ 30 ] . Tetraspanins are transmembrane proteins defined by small and large outer loops , short N - terminal and C - terminal tails with four transmembrane domains . They form complexes termed tetraspanin - enriched micro - domains ( TEMs ) by interacting with other tetraspanins and with a variety of transmembrane and cytosolic pro - teins that are required for their function [ 31 ] . Several tetraspanin molecules have been identified and impli - cated in the regulation of cell proliferation , cell migra - tion and cell fusion [ 32 ] . The most important partners are integrins , particularly α 3 β 1 , α 4 β 1 , α 6 β 1 and α 6 β 4 , intracellular associated heterotrimeric G proteins , prote - ases , immunoglobulin superfamily members and cytosolic signal transduction molecules [ 31 ] . The repertoire of tetraspanins differs between cancer cell types ; therefore , a complete characterization of tetraspanin - associated pro - teins and functions is difficult to accomplish and may not be generalized . Nevertheless , in the majority of cancer cell types , including HCC , a characteristic feature is the evi - dent presence of integrins , signaling proteins and prote - ases as important components of these domains [ 33 ] . Tetraspanin CD81 Tetraspanin CD81 was identified originally as the target of an anti - proliferative antibody ( TAPA - 1 ) that inhibited in vitro cellular proliferation [ 34 ] . CD81 is involved in a broad range of cellular functions as revealed by the bind - ing of monoclonal antibodies . The antibodies evoke their effect by mimicking a natural ligand or by altering the interactions between CD81 and its associated proteins . Al - though the protein is widely expressed , its levels within a single tissue vary in response to cellular activation . An im - portant feature of tetraspanin CD81 is its ability to associ - ate with itself forming homodimers and with various other Rombouts and Carloni Fibrogenesis & Tissue Repair 2013 , 6 : 17 Page 2 of 6 http : / / www . fibrogenesis . com / content / 6 / 1 / 17 receptors into membrane microdomains . Up - regulation of CD81 in pre - malignant hepatocytes can contribute to re - organizing the plasma membrane in domains where sig - naling proteins can be recruited [ 35 ] . CD81 regulation of proliferation is positively associated with activation of the extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) / MAPK pathway . CD81 overexpression can activate ERK1 / 2 while promoting proliferation [ 35 ] . Importantly , CD81 induces reorganization of the plasma membrane amplifying the instability of pre - malignant hepatocytes and enhancing their neoplastic progression . Therefore , phenotype hetero - geneity could be influenced primarily by a fluctuation of a single protein and associated factors organized in discrete plasma membrane domains . These membrane micro - domains represent versatile devices for compartmentaliz - ing different signaling functions . In the non - activated state they float freely , carrying a few passenger proteins , but , when activated , they coalesce to form larger platforms where proteins meet to transfer functions in signaling , processing and transport [ 36 ] . When the hepatocytes progress in their transform - ation , the tendency of CD81 expression is to be lost , as revealed by two clinical studies showing a decreased or absent CD81 expression , particularly in metastatic tis - sues [ 37 , 38 ] . HCC cells re - expressing CD81 are still capable of proliferating and producing the principal tumor when injected into the liver of nude rats ; how - ever , they contain a defective faculty to produce tu - mors in distant parts of the liver [ 39 ] . These findings strengthen the vision that CD81 is a facilitator of cell proliferation and in the meantime is a negative con - troller / regulator of movement when expressed by the cells . This is supported by the current view that cell growth and ability to metastasize are two conditions of malignancy not necessarily overlapping [ 40 ] . Tetraspanin CD151 The initial evidence that CD151 promotes metastasis came from a study showing that an antibody with un - known specificity inhibited metastasis formation by a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line in vivo . The anti - body was found to recognize CD151 , and inhibit cell migration without affecting adhesion or proliferation [ 41 ] . Overexpression of CD151 is seen in many tumor types . In breast , pancreatic , colorectal and non - small - cell lung cancer , high CD151 expression is associated with a poor prognosis [ 33 ] . Overexpression of CD151 has been associated with poor prognosis also in HCC . Some studies have indi - cated that CD151 overexpression promotes the metasta - sis / invasion of cancer cells by mediating integrin signals , while others have argued that an increased expression of CD151 contributes to activate phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase / protein kinase Akt pathway [ 42 ] . Indeed , the high expressions of CD151 and α 6 integrin are major contrib - utors to the invasion - prone phenotype of HCC . In con - trast with CD81 , the contribution of CD151 to HCC metastasis / invasion provides an example of the facilita - tor role of this tetraspanin ( Figure 2 ) . Apart from CD151 , the tetraspanin TSPAN8 ( previously known as CO - 029 , TM4SF3 ) has been also associated with tumor progression [ 43 ] . Overexpression of TSPAN8 is de - scribed on hepatocellular carcinomas that are poorly dif - ferentiated and prone to intrahepatic spreading [ 44 ] . Conversely , down - regulation of tetraspanin CD82 / KAI1 was observed at the levels of both mRNA and protein . Figure 1 Interaction among factors that determine phenotypic heterogeneity in HCC . Combinations of environmental , genomic and proteomic variation can cause heterogeneity in an initially homogenous population of pre - malignant hepatocytes . Rombouts and Carloni Fibrogenesis & Tissue Repair 2013 , 6 : 17 Page 3 of 6 http : / / www . fibrogenesis . com / content / 6 / 1 / 17 This was particularly pronounced in poorly differenti - ated HCCs . Importantly , the CD82 / KAI1 level correlated inversely with intrahepatic metastases [ 45 ] . Differences in integrin expression and signaling within HCC The pattern of integrins expressed by human hepatocytes is strikingly different from most other epithelial cells [ 46 ] . Normal adult hepatocytes express low levels of only three integrins : α 1 β 1 , a collagen and laminin receptor ; α 5 β 1 , a fibronectin receptor ; and α 9 β 1 , a tenascin receptor . In contrast , other integrin receptors , such as α 2 β 1 , α 3 β 1 , α 6 β 1 and α 6 β 4 , are undetectable on normal hepatocytes . One of the most frequent alterations during liver carcino - genesis is the de novo expression of the integrin , α 6 β 1 . HCC patients characterized by multiple tumors , vascular invasion and the absence of encapsulation exhibit in - creased α 6 β 1 expression [ 47 ] . In fact , the induction of α 6 β 1 is an early event in hepatocellular carcinogenesis , and it is reasonable to consider that α 6 β 1 contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis based on several lines of evidence [ 48 - 51 ] . For this reason , it is important to understand the mechanism by which the α 6 β 1 integrin influences the function of HCC cells . One likely possibility is that α 6 β 1 - mediated activation of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) and ERK1 / 2 controls signaling pathways important for HCC function [ 52 ] . Both FAK and ERK1 / 2 are of interest because they are regulated by integrin - mediated at - tachment to ECM , as well as growth factor stimulation , and they control important functions of tumor cells , such as growth and migration . Another possibility suggests that overexpression of α 6 β 1 could provide a ligand - independent growth advantage by modulating the cellular architecture or a signaling pathway required for cell growth [ 51 ] . Interestingly , the role of α 3 β 1 integrin appears more controversial in hepatocarcinogenesis . A previous study indicated that TGF - β 1 was able to induce a significant increase in the expression level of α 3 β 1 , which consecu - tively cooperated with TGF - β 1 to induce HCC cell epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) [ 53 ] . In a re - cent study , investigators could not confirm the previous findings when evaluating α 3 β 1 expression in HCC tissue specimen of patients with high concentration of serum TGF - β 1 levels nor could be demonstrated a significant up - regulation of α 3 β 1 in HCC cells after 24 or 48 hours of TGF - β 1 stimulation . Indeed , they find that the ampli - fied integrin α 6 β 1 signaling pathway is able to induce EMT of HCC cells [ 42 ] . ADAMs ADAMs are multidomain proteins that contain a disintegrin and a metalloprotease domain [ 54 ] . Their metalloprotease domains can induce ectodomain shedding and cleave ECM Figure 2 Tetraspanin - enriched microdomain variation as a component of HCC progression . The signaling pathway varies between cell types when differential TEM profiling is expressed following exposure to a cell agonist or through changes in the microenvironment . These variations in signaling can profoundly affect the tumorigenicity and metastatic properties of HCC cells . a ) Following stimulation , CD81 - associated proteins inhibit tumor cell migration , possibly through a blockade of ezrin - radixin - moesin ( ERM ) protein activation , inhibiting actin reorganization . b ) Reduced expression of CD81 and up - regulation of CD151 , α 6 β 1 integrin and ADAM10 foster invasion and possibly metastases through events of actin cortex - membrane destabilization during cell motility . Rombouts and Carloni Fibrogenesis & Tissue Repair 2013 , 6 : 17 Page 4 of 6 http : / / www . fibrogenesis . com / content / 6 / 1 / 17 proteins [ 55 ] . Their disintegrin and cysteine - rich domains have adhesive and fusion activities . Hence , ADAMs are poised to modulate a variety of cell - cell and cell - ECM in - teractions . ADAM10 , a member of the ADAM family , was detected in all human HCC tissues tested by immunohis - tochemistry but not in normal liver tissues [ 56 ] . Moreover , CD44 , a typical substrate of ADAM10 protease , was also expressed in all human HCC tissues but not in normal liver tissues . These data suggest that overexpression of ADAM10 and CD44 is a characteristic of human HCC . Specifically , ADAM10 is involved in the intramembrane proteolysis process , whereby it mediates ectodomain shedding of various membrane - bound receptors , adhe - sion molecules , growth factors and cytokines [ 57 ] . Conclusions HCC cell phenotypes are the result of the integration of inputs from genotype and environmental stimuli . Epi - genetic changes that arise during tumor progression alter and diversify cellular phenotypes , posing a major obstacle to the understanding and clinical management of HCC . We suggest that the phenomenon of intra - tumor phenotypic heterogeneity , especially aspects that are related to clonal diversity , deserve to be recognized and accounted for during the analysis of HCC tumor , building of experimental models and design of thera - peutic approaches . The dominance of gene - centric views has been chal - lenged with the rapid development of research establishing that because tumors contain phenotypically distinct popu - lations of both tumor and stromal cells that interact in a dynamic and reciprocal manner , these interactions are likely to result in the emergence of different proteome profiling . This aspect creates significant problems in employing therapeutic procedures in which micro - environmental changes make a procedure inefficient and in some regions of the HCC a therapeutic result may not be achieved . This inequality of therapy gives HCC cells time to develop resistant phenotypes . In addition , components of the microenvironment can ac - tively protect tumor cells from treatment through se - creted factors and cell contact - mediated pro - survival stimuli . Heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment translates into heterogeneity of tumor cell phenotypes , and so some tumor cells might be intrinsically less sensi - tive to the therapy . Intra - tumor heterogeneity , associated with heterogeneous protein function , may promote HCC progression through Darwinian selection .
