In the business world , life outside the mainstream is harsh , and social objects ( e . g . , ideas , products , technol - ogies , or organizational forms ) that lie off the beaten path tend to be overlooked . Although there is a growing consensus that the process of novelty recognition is key to understanding the journey of novelty from the moment it arises to the time it takes hold ( e . g . , Cattani et al . , 2017 ; Perry - Smith & Mannucci , 2017 ; Sgourev , 2013 ; Zhou et al . , 2017 ) , extant research has yet to expound on a crucial and common problem that tends to undermine the recognition of novelty : entering into the attention space of the evaluating audience ( s ) . As Csikszentmihalyi ( 1996 , p . 345 ) pointed out , “the most fundamental difference between people consists in how much uncommitted attention they have left over to deal with novelty . In too many cases , attention is restricted by external necessity . ” The novelty - attention problem reflects a puzzling tension : the type of novelty that demands more attention to be recognized also deflects audiences’ attention away ( Trapido , 2015 ) . This problem may by compounded by several factors . Besides simply being overwhelmed by the number of ideas they must sort through ( Piezunka & Dahlander , 2015 ) , novelty evaluators may not have the cognitive bandwidth and skills to recognize the value of an idea ( Berg , 2016 ; Criscuolo et al . , 2017 ) . In addition , people may have implicit biases against new ideas ( Chai & Menon , 2019 ; Mueller et al . , 2012 ) . Research has also shown a tendency among managers to favor ideas from people they know or who somehow resemble them ( Aadland et al . , 2018 ; Reitzig & Sorenson , 2013 ) . Such in - group biases often persist even after correcting for the quality of an idea . Whether or not novel ideas are recognized might also depend on how connected they are to other ideas . On the one hand , highly connected ideas might be perceived as novel because they blend existing knowledge in new ways but , on the other hand , they might also be perceived as familiar because people can relate more easily to such connected ideas ( Deichmann et al . , 2020 ) .

Because any novel social object must attract and win social audience’s attention in order to advance in its legitimation journey , we need scholarly inquiry to deepen our under - standing of the underlying mechanisms that govern how and why novelty gets recognition . To this end , we encourage researchers from a diverse array of academic disciplines – including organizational sociology , organizational behavior , strategy and psychology – to submit papers for this special issue that address how novelty and new ideas get evaluated , appreciated , or selected . We are open to different types of conceptual or theoretically grounded empirical work based on qualitative and / or quantitative methods . We especially welcome work that aims to challenge received wisdom in the organizational literature . We also look forward to manuscripts whose theoretical perspectives and empirical findings allow comparing practices across different empirical settings . To this end , we would like to solicit conceptual and empirical papers addressing the following or similar questions : Novel ideas ● What are the definitions and characteristics of novel ideas ? ● How and when does novelty enter the attention space of individuals ? Innovators ● How do innovators overcome resistance against their novel ideas ? ● What kind of framing strategies and narratives may be useful to apply for innovators to help audiences evaluate , appreciate , and select novelty ? ● How does the recognition of an innovator’s earlier novel work stimulate or inhibit subsequent behavior such as the generation of new ideas ? Evaluators ● What are the factors that influence the accuracy of idea evaluations ? ● How can idea evaluators overcome some of the challenges that are associated with the evaluation , appreciation , and selection of novel ideas ? ● How and when do organizations allocate attention to novel ideas ? Context ● When does novelty win the attention of relevant audiences and then progress in its journey towards recognition ? ● What audience level features may render the field more or less permeable to the evaluation , appreciation , and selection of novelty ? ● What is the role of exogenous shocks in opening entry points for the introduction of novelty ? 446 CALL FOR PAPERS Submission process and timeline If your work addresses the above or similar questions about the evaluation , appreciation , and selection of novelty and if you are interested in this special issue of IOM , we would like to receive your manuscript no later than 31 January 2022 to be peer reviewed . When completing your submission , please make sure to clearly select the correct special issue track . The paper should reflect the editorial guidelines of IOM . You are welcome to contact any or all of the Guest Editors for further information . We anticipate that this issue will be published in IOM in 2023 . However , as soon as the review process is completed , your paper will be published on the IOM website and therefore they might appear earlier .
