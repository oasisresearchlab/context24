1 of 2 Arch Dis Child August 2021 Vol 106 No 8 Letter Hospitalisation of children with SARS - CoV - 2 on the general paediatric ward : coping with a persistent pandemic INTRODUCTION The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) recommends consid - ering admitting patients with SARS - CoV - 2 virus to a dedicated ward . 1 These guide - lines are problematic for children as the number of children admitted with COVID - 19 during the pandemic is small compared with adults , and in clinical prac - tice , many children who test positive for the virus are hospitalised for non - COVID - 19 - related reasons . Admission to the general paediatric ward may be the better option . We examined the number of infections among staff and patients during and after hospitalisation to a general paediatric ward admitting patients with SARS - CoV - 2 . METHODS Ours is the largest tertiary paediatric hospital in Israel . The hospital policy is to screen all patients and most caregivers of admitted children with SARS - CoV - 2 . During May to August 2020 ( 123 days ) , patients positive for SARS - CoV - 2 were placed in isolation rooms in the paedi - atric ward ( figure 1 ) , each with a dedi - cated bathroom and an antechamber for removing personal protective equipment ( PPE ) . Every staff member entering the isolation room was required to wear full PPE according to CDC guidelines . We used audio and visual measurements to examine patients in the isolation rooms , as well as staff who entered these rooms as medically necessary . Data on staff infec - tion were retrieved from the infection control unit . We examined the national computerised medical records for the post - hospitalisation 14 - day period of all negative patients , in order to identify cases of infection after hospitalisation . RESULTS A SARS - CoV - 2 - positive patient was present on the ward for 56 / 123 ( 45 . 5 % ) days of the study period . Of 39 confirmed patients with SARS - CoV - 2 hospitalised in isolation rooms , 19 were family members ( adults ) and 20 children ; 10 children were admitted due to signs / symptoms of COVID - 19 and 10 due to other medical conditions alongside SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Disease severity was mild in 17 children , moderate in 2 and severe in 1 . Only one staff member tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 during the study period , infected via a positive family member , not in hospital . No other patients from the ward tested positive . Among the 566 negative patients , 7 tested positive after hospitalisation , all of them more than 14 days after discharge . There were two cases of non - compliance with isolation rules involving patients with psychiatric symptoms . DISCUSSION We found that admitting children or parents who are SARS - CoV - 2 positive in a general paediatric ward has a very low risk of infection to other patients or staff . In adults , there were reports of a nosocomial SARS - CoV - 2 infection rate of 7 . 1 % – 20 % . 2 3 The low infection rate in our study may be attributed to the measures taken and to the less contagious nature of children . 4 SARS - CoV - 2 - positive children are often hospitalised for reasons related to other general paediatric diseases , and in our opinion , they deserve multidis - ciplinary treatment managed by experi - enced staff from the regular paediatric ward . Towards the upcoming winter months , we suggest to admit SARS - CoV - 2 - positive children in a standard paediatric ward , while taking protective measures for staff and patients .
