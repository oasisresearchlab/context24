Here , we studied the role of a Rho GAP protein GRAF1 ( G TPase R egulator A ssociated with F ocal adhesion kinase - 1 ) in the regulation of the epithelial phenotype in cells of breast derived , non - malignant , MCF10A cell line . GRAF1 was shown to be localized to cell - cell junctions , and its depletion resulted in accelerated cell migration velocity , elongation of the cells and cell colonies , impaired monolayer integrity and signi ﬁ cant disruption of desmosomes with a loss of associated keratin ﬁ laments . These processes were accompanied by formation of larger focal adhesions , an increased number of contractile actin stress ﬁ bers , reduction in epithelial markers and increase in mesenchymal markers such as epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) - speci ﬁ c transcription factors Snail - 1 and Snail - 2 , as well as N - cadherin , and vimentin . Moreover , unlike control cells , GRAF1 knocked - down cells demonstrated anchorage - independent growth in soft agar . GRAF1 expression in several highly invasive breast cancer cell lines was low , as compared to the non - malignant MCF10A cells , while overexpressing of GRAF1 in the malignant BT - 549 cell line led to a decrease of mesenchymal markers , especially the Snail - 1 and 2 . Altogether , our analysis suggests that GRAF1 plays a role in the maintenance of normal epithelial phenotype and its depletion leads to an EMT - like process that might be involved in neoplastic transformation . KEYWORDS anchorage dependence ; cell - cell junctions ; focal adhesions ; cell migration ; EMT ; E - cadherin ; MCF10A Introduction Epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) 1 is a process shown to be fundamental to both normal development , and the progression of malignant epithelial tumors . 2 , 3 In the course of EMT , epithelial cells lose cell – cell adhesion structures such as adherens junctions and desmosomes , rearrange their cytoskeleton , develop front - rear polarity and enhance migration . 4 Activation of the transcrip - tional regulators , Snail - 1 ( formerly Snail ) 5 and Snail - 2 ( also known as Slug ) , as well as several others , is thought to underlie the changes in gene expression patterns occurring during EMT . 6 A hallmark of EMT is the loss of epithelial E - cadherin and the gain of mesenchymal N - cadherin expression . This cadherin switch 7 leads to a drastic change in the adhesive properties of the cell ; N - cadherin expression also promotes increased cell migration and invasion . 8 , 9 The disassembly of junctional complexes and the changes in cytoskeletal organization that occur during EMT are orchestrated by alteration of activity of intracellular effector molecules , such as members of the small Rho GTPase family as well as Src - family protein tyrosine - kinases . 6 Among RhoGTPases , the best - characterized molecules are RhoA , RhoB , RhoC , Rac1 and Cdc42 that regulate actin cytoskeleton . In particular , the active ( GTP - bound ) RhoA stimulates myosin II - driven contractility through activation of Rho kinase ( ROCK ) , and promotes actin polymeriza - tion through activation of Diaphanous family for - mins . 10 , 11 As a result , cells develop contractile myosin - II containing actin bundles ( stress ﬁ bers ) associated with a special type of integrin - mediated cell - matrix adhesions known as focal adhesions . 11 RhoA and RhoC also play a role in neoplastic pro - cesses : their overexpression was detected in a large vari - ety of human tumors . 12 , 13 In particular , protein levels of RhoA were signi ﬁ cantly higher in breast tumors , as com - pared to normal mammary tissue . 14 Moreover , activation CONTACT Alexander D .

Rho GTPase activation is tightly controlled by 3 groups of regulatory proteins , guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEF ) , GTPase - activating proteins ( GAP ) , and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors ( GDI ) . In this study , we focus on a RhoGTPase - activat - ing protein GRAF1 ( GTPase Regulator Associated with Focal adhesion kinase ) , which was shown to exert GAP activity toward RhoA and Cdc42 and binds to Focal Adhesion Kinase via its SH3 domain . 16 GRAF1 ( known also as ARHGAP26 ) is a member of the ARHGAP family of proteins . In addition to GAP and SH3 domains , it also contains a BAR - PH domain that underlies its involve - ment in clathrin - independent endocytosis . 17 , 18 GRAF1 was reported to have 2 isoforms : the “ A ” isoform mostly expressed in leukocytes , and the “ B ” isoform , highly expressed in many types of epithelial tissues , in particular in the mammary glands and also in nervous tissues . 19 Since GRAF1 is a physiological negative regulator of Rho activity , we decided to study whether this protein participates in the regulation of the epithelial phenotype and EMT processes . MCF10A cells were selected as an appropriate cell type for these studies because of their phenotypic plasticity . Single MCF10A cells display typi - cal EMT - like changes , in contrast to an epithelial pheno - type seen in MCF10A cells organized in groups , or growing as monolayers . 20 In our study , we investigated the effect of GRAF1 knockdown on morphology , cytoskeletal organization , cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesion and motility of MCF10A cells . We found that GRAF1 depletion triggers the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in these cells . In addition , we found that loss of GRAF1 was typical for neoplastically transformed lines of breast can - cer origin . Thus , GRAF1 function appears to be impor - tant for the maintenance of the normal phenotype in mammary gland epithelium . Results Cell shape , cell - cell junction integrity and cell migration velocity changes in MCF10A epithelial cells upon knockdown of RhoGAP GRAF1 Here , we tested the effect of GRAF1 silencing on the phe - notype of cultured non - transformed MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells . Transient GRAF1 depletion was obtained using a siRNA SMARTpool for GRAF1 ( isoform B ) , while a stable line of GRAF1 isoform B - depleted MCF10A cells was produced by lentiviral infection with the plasmid encoding the corresponding shRNA , and subsequent selection . Decrease of GRAF1 expression obtained by siGRAF1 was assessed on west - ern blot and real time PCR . On western blot , an 80 % decrease in the GRAF1 protein encoded by isoform B was seen ( Fig . 1C , left ) . We obtained also some reduction in the GRAF1 isoform A expression . On real - time PCR , the decrease of GRAF1 RNA expression was up to 40 % ( Fig . 1C , middle ) . We obtained an almost complete decrease of both isoforms of GRAF1 in the stable line expressing shGRAF1 ( Fig . 1C , right ) . Immuno ﬂ uores - cence staining of control and GRAF1 - depleted cells with a - tubulin antibody revealed no differences between the 2 groups ( Supplementary Fig . 1A ) . In control MCF10A cells , GRAF1 localizes to the cell - cell junctions partially overlapping with E - cadherin ( Fig . 1A ) . While control cells formed circular epithelial islands ( Fig . 1A insight and 2A , top ) , depletion of GRAF1 led to formation of elongated islands ( Fig . 1B insight and Fig . 2A bottom ) . Strikingly , GRAF1 - depleted cells were characterized by a signi ﬁ cant decrease in the E - cadherin junctional level ( Fig . 1B and Fig . 2D ) . An off - target effect was ruled out by transfection of MCF10A cells with 4 individual siRNAs targeted to GRAF1 , which comprised the GRAF1 siRNA SMARTpool . A signi ﬁ cant reduction in E - cadherin and b - catenin at cell - cell junc - tions was obtained after cell transfection with 3 out of 4 individual SMARTpool siRNAs , as was demonstrated by immuno ﬂ uorescence staining ( Supplementary Fig . 1D - H ) and by Western blot ( Supplementary Fig . 1B , C ) . It is worth noting that among cells depleted of GRAF1 , some cells still demonstrated high E - cadherin intensity . These cells were usually gathered at one extremity of the cell group , usually at the rear ( Fig . 1B , arrow ) . Measurements of intensity of E - cadherin - anti - body staining at the cell - cell contact showed an average decrease in E - cadherin junctional level in GRAF1 - depleted cells to less than 40 % , relative to that in control cells ( Fig . 2D ) . A series of assays , was performed to characterize changes in cell shape and motility upon GRAF1 knockdown . Cells lacking GRAF1 displayed a four - fold - higher aspect ratio when compared to controls ( Fig . 2C , left ) , while the average cell area remained unchanged ( Fig . 2C , right ) . Aspect ratio assessment con ﬁ rmed the visual impression that islands formed by GRAF1 - depleted cells are signi ﬁ cantly more elon - gated than the typical epithelial islands formed by control cells or “ scrambled ” siRNA - transfected cells ( Fig . 2C , middle ) . Thus , the degree of spreading of the GRAF1 - knockdown cells remains unchanged , but the cells become more elongated , and form elongated groups . 368 M . REGEV ET AL . Morphology of GRAF1 - depleted cells was further assessed in live cells , by means of phase contrast - micros - copy . In the elongated groups of GRAF1 - depleted cells , one or 2 cells extended large lamellas at the epithelial island ’ s leading edge , while others appeared to be non - protrusive . Moreover , the cells from the interior often migrated through the entire island toward the leading edge , disrupting the cell - cell junctions . As a result , some epithelial islands underwent scattering and disintegration during the 20 - hour period of observation . Control epithe - lial islands , on the other hand , moved as a whole , preserv - ing mutual contacts with each other , and the circular shape of the epithelial island ( Fig . 2B ; Videos 1 and 2 ) . Migration velocity of MCF10A control cells , GRAF1 - depleted cells , and GFP - GRAF1 overexpressing cells was measured by tracking the centers of the nuclei for Figure 1 .

CELL ADHESION AND MIGRATION 369 20 hours , with a 20 - minute time lapse between frames . In all cases , the cells that were located at the edges of a group , rather than the cells embedded in a monolayer , were tracked . GRAF1 - depleted cells displayed a twofold - higher migration velocity as compared to controls , while GRAF1 - overexpressing cells moved more slowly than controls ( Fig . 2E ) . Scanning and transmission electron microscopy ( SEM and TEM ) were further used to investigate the structural alterations induced by GRAF1 knockdown in MCF10A cells . As noted in the phase - contrast images , GRAF1 - depleted cells demonstrated an elon - gated cell shape and protruding lamellipodia at the island ’ s leading edges ( Fig . 3A , right , white arrow ) . Figure 2 . ( For ﬁ gure legend , see page 371 . ) 370 M . REGEV ET AL . In addition , these cells displayed more numerous microvilli distributed over the entire cell surface , as well as structures resembling ﬁ lopodia emerging from the cell edges , than control MCF10A cells ( Fig . 3A ) . TEM was used to assess the integrity of cell - cell junc - tions in control and GRAF1 - depleted cells . In agreement with previously published results , 21 control MCF10A cells demonstrated typical adherens junctions and des - mosomes , but very few tight junctions . In GRAF1 - depleted cells , the gaps between cells in the area of the adherens junctions were broader , with a larger intercellu - lar space ( Fig . 3B , lower panel , yellow arrow ) than that seen in controls ( yellow arrowheads ) , and multiple microvilli were seen protruding into this space . The number of desmosomes was apparently fewer than in control cells , even though quite a few desmosomes were still seen upon GRAF1 knockdown . These desmosomes , however , were smaller ( Fig . 3B , upper panel , yellow arrow ) and associated with less prominent arrays of cyto - keratin ﬁ bers , as compared to the desmosomes in control cells ( arrowhead ) . Thus , GRAF1 depletion induced severe changes in the integrity of cell - cell junction complexes . Changes in the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions in MCF10A after GRAF1 depletion Focal adhesions ( FAs ) are dynamic molecular com - plexes connecting the extracellular matrix with the actin cytoskeleton of adherent cells , via integrin - fam - ily transmembrane receptors and a plethora of associ - ated linking proteins . 22 , 23 In essence , FAs are signaling structures , transmitting to cells information about the biochemical and physical characteristics of their microenvironment ; they are also involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton , cell shape and migration , and matrix remodeling . 24 To assess how focal adhesions are altered upon GRAF1 depletion , we used immuno ﬂ uorescence staining to visualize 2 characteristic components of focal adhesions , paxillin and zyxin . Focal adhesions visualized by anti - paxillin antibody were 1 . 5 - fold larger in GRAF1 - depleted cells than in controls ( Fig . 4A , upper panel , and 4B ) . A similar increase in focal adhesion size was also observed by visualization of focal adhesions with anti - zyxin antibodies ( Fig . 4A , middle panel ) . Interestingly , visualization of zyxin revealed that this protein local - ized not only to focal adhesions , but also to the actin bundles ( “ stress ﬁ bers ” ) associated with them ( Fig . 4A , middle panel , arrow and Fig . 4C ) . The per - centage of cell , in which zyxin was localized to stress ﬁ bers was signi ﬁ cantly higher in GFAF1 - depleted cells than in control ones ( p < 0 . 0005 according to t - test ) . In addition , in cells lacking GRAF - 1 , actin stress ﬁ bers were more prominent than in control MCF10A cells ( Fig . 4A , lower panel ) . While in control cells , actin staining with phalloidin revealed mainly radial - oriented bundles ( Fig . 4A , lower panel , white arrow ) , in GRAF1 knockdown cells , numerous parallel stress ﬁ bers were usually oriented along the long axes of the individual cells , parallel to the long axis of the entire island ( Fig . 4A , lower panel , yellow arrow ) . GRAF1 depletion in MCF10A cells is accompanied by an increase in mesenchymal markers The fact that GRAF1 depletion led to increased cell elongation , reduction of E - cadherin at the cell - cell junctions , and an increase in the cell ’ s migratory abil - ity , raised the question of whether depletion of GRAF1 could induce changes that occur in the course of EMT processes . 6 , 25 Cytokeratins 5 and 14 , classic epithelial markers , decreased dramatically in GRAF1 - depleted cells , as dem - onstrated by both immuno ﬂ uorescence staining Figure 2 . ( see previous page ) Morphology and motility of GRAF1 - depleted cells . ( A ) E - cadherin antibody staining reveals that a control colony of MCF10A cells ( top ) displays , on average , higher levels of E - cadherin at cell - cell junctions , than a colony from a GRAF1 - depleted MCF10A cell culture ( bottom ) .

Control cells are not elongated ; rather , form approximately circular islands . Displacement of cells in the island during the 24 - hour observation period did not exceed the cell diameter . GRAF1 - depleted cells form an elongated island , and move from the interior of the island to the cell periphery . Scale bar : 10 m m .

REGEV ET AL . ( Fig . 5C ) and Western blotting ( Fig . 5D ) . At the same time , the amount of mesenchimal marker vimentin , 26 as well as density of vimentin - positive intermediate ﬁ la - ments , increased upon GRAF1 depletion ( Fig . 5A and B ) . Alpha - tubulin was used as a loading control in these experiments . Replacement of epithelial E - cadherin for mesenchy - mal N - cadherin is known to be a hallmark of EMT . Indeed , in our study , N - cadherin partially replaced E - cadherin in GRAF1 - depleted cells ( Fig . 5E ) ; how - ever , the replacement of E - cadherin by N - cadherin occurred in a non - uniform fashion . We noted that the replacement of E - cadherin by N - cadherin was more prominent at the leading edges of elongated cell groups ( corresponding to cells extending protrusions in the direction of collective movement ) while at the opposite end of the same group ( rear ) , E - cadherin was still strongly expressed [ Fig . 1B , arrow and Fig . 5E ( lower panel ) ] , and expression levels of N - cadherin were lower . Interestingly , GRAF1 knockdown brought about a signi ﬁ cant increase , not only in junctional but also in total ( cytoplasmic ) N - cadherin ( Fig . 5E - G ) , while a decrease in junctional E - cadherin was not accompanied by an equally strong decrease in its cyto - plasmic levels ( compare Figs . 2D , 5G ) . Augmented levels of the transcription factors snail - 1 and snail - 2 constitute a well - established mechanism of EMT , underlying the alterations in expression of many downstream target genes . 27 We found that in GRAF1 - depleted cells , the expression of snail - 1 and snail - 2 increased dramatically ( Fig . 5G ) . The expression of snail - 1 was barely detectable in control cells , but very Figure 4 . Junctional and cytoskeletal changes following GRAF - 1 depletion .

CELL ADHESION AND MIGRATION 373 prominent in the cells lacking GRAF1 , the expression of snail - 2 showed a 2 - fold increase . Altogether , the altera - tions in expression of the EMT markers upon GRAF1 knockdown are summarized in Fig . 5G . In view of these data , we conclude that GRAF1 - depleted cells demon - strate an EMT - like phenotype . Figure 5 . ( For ﬁ gure legend , see page 375 . ) 374 M . REGEV ET AL . MCF10A GRAF1 - depleted cells are able to form colonies in soft agar gel “ Anchorage independence ” - that is the ability of cells to form colonies in a semi - solid medium in conditions of substrate deprivation – is a very typical feature of neo - plastically transformed cells . It was previously shown that MCF10A cells that underwent an EMT process fol - lowing ras transformation , acquire the ability to form such colonies . 28 In our study , control and GRAF1 - depleted MCF10A cells were cultured for 3 weeks in soft agar gel enriched by growth medium . The colonies formed during this period were imaged using an inverted microscope , and classi ﬁ ed according to size ( Table 1 ) . While in control MCF10A cultures , only single cells or cell fragments having less than 20 m m 2 area were detected , GRAF1 - depleted cells formed numerous cell aggregates with area between 20 and 100 m m 2 , and some bigger colonies having 100 - 200 m m 2 area ( Table 1 ) . Thus , we can conclude that GRAF1 knockdown made MCF10A cells less anchorage - dependent , a ﬁ nding that supports the hypothesis that GRAF1 knockdown in MCF10A cells promotes EMT . Correlation of GRAF1 low expression with invasiveness and EMT phenotype in breast cancer - derived cell lines The GRAF1 gene was reported to be disrupted in juve - nile myelomonocytic leukemia 29 and aberrant methyla - tion of the GRAF1 promoter was detected in patients with acute myeloid leukemia . 30 To reveal the possible correlation between GRAF1 levels and cancer cell pheno - type , we assessed GRAF1 expression levels in 7 different cell lines , all of breast cancer origin : invasive MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - MB - 468 , MDA - MB - 435 , and SUM - 149 , which preserved an epithelial - like morphology , MDA - MB - 436 and BT - 549 , characterized by a polymorphic morphology , and the non - invasive neoplastic MCF7 line ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Unlike non - malignant MCF10A cells , all 7 selected cell lines displayed low expression levels of GRAF1 ( Fig . 6A ) , suggesting that the GRAF1 gene is involved in maintenance of the normal epithelial phenotype , and may therefore be considered as a tumor suppressor - type gene . In order to determine whether overexpression of GRAF1 in neoplastic cells would reverse their phenotype , we selected the BT - 549 cell line , characterized by a poly - morphic mesenchymal morphology , and expressed GFP - GRAF1 in these cells . Roughly 72 hours after transfec - tion , GFP - GRAF1 expressing BT - 549 cells displayed a decrease in snail - 1 and snail - 2 expression to 20 % and 10 % , of their levels in non - transfected cells , respectively ( Fig . 6B ) . Regarding the N - to E - cadherin switch , a 45 % elevation in E - cadherin levels , and a decrease of N - cad - herin to 27 % of its level in wild - type BT - 549 cells , were observed ( Fig . 6B ) . These data suggest that GRAF1 expression led to a partial reversal of the mesenchymal to epithelial phenotype in neoplastic cells . Involvement of Rho family GTPases in the GRAF1 knockdown - induced EMT - like phenotype Since the major biological function of GRAF1 known thus far is the modulation of Rho activity we examined whether GRAF1 knockdown affects the activity of RhoA in MCF10A GRAF1 - depleted cells . We also studied the activity of Rac1 , another major Rho family protein , which is known to be involved in regulating the forma - tion of cell lamellipodia . 31 To measure Rho activity , we used Rhotekin - Rho bind - ing domain ( RBD ) - coated beads , which pull down only active GTP - RhoA . In a similar manner , we measured Rac activity with beads coated with the Rac binding domain of PAK - kinase ( PAK1 - PBD ) , which pull down only active GTP - Rac1 . In both cases , GTP - and GDP - enriched samples of cell lysates were used as positive and negative controls , respectively , for each RhoA and Rac1 assay . Results were normalized to total RhoA and total Rac1 levels in control and GRAF1 - depleted cells and expressed as a percent of control . We thus showed that Figure 5 .

( G ) Quanti ﬁ cation of the levels of expression of EMT markers in GRAF1 - depleted cells is shown as percents of control . The a - tubulin level was used as a loading control ; values representing the expression lev - els of all proteins of interest were normalized to the a - tubulin level . CELL ADHESION AND MIGRATION 375 the GRAF1 - depleted cells sample demonstrates a promi - nent increase in RhoA activity ( Fig . 7A and 7B left panel ) . We also noticed a 40 per cent decrease in Rac1 activity in the GRAF1 - depleted cells sample in compari - son to the control sample ( Fig . 7A and 7B right panel ) . Could the increase in RhoA activity observed in GRAF1 - depleted cells constitute the mechanism responsible for other phenotypic changes related to EMT , and enable iden - ti ﬁ cation of downstream targets of Rho that might be involved in this process ? To explore this issue , we treated GRAF1 - depleted cells with the Y27632 Rho - kinase inhibi - tor . Changes in ﬂ uorescence intensity of E - cadherin cell - cell junctions , noted at different time intervals following addi - tion of the inhibitor , were assessed . One hour after Y27632 treatment , partial recovery of cell - cell contacts was observed , together with a decrease in average focal adhesion area , visu - alized by zyxin - antibody staining ( Fig . 8A and C ) . Overall , the recovery of cell - cell junctions appeared incomplete , and the level of E - cadherin intensity never approached that of control MCF10A cells ( Fig . 8B ) . Discussion The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the RhoGAP - domain - containing protein GRAF1 in the control of epithelial cell morphology and dynamics . The phenotypic changes we observed as a result of GRAF1 - knockdown in MCF10A cells include disruption of desmosomes and cell - cell adherens junctions coupled with an E - cadherin to N - cadherin shift , decrease in epi - thelial markers such as cytokeratin 5 and 14 and increase in mesenchymal markers such as vimentin , snail - 1 and snail - 2 , cell elongation and enhancement of stress ﬁ bers , increase in migration ability .

Previous studies showed that the EMT program and its elements , such as loss of E - cadherin and increased activity of Snail - 1 , highly correlate with and most probably drive the tumor malignancy . 34 , 35 Consistently , we found low expression levels of the GRAF1 protein in several invasive breast cancer - derived cell lines . Moreover , the MCF7 breast cancer - derived , non - invasive cell line displayed a low GRAF1 level as well . To determine to what extent GRAF1 can restore the normal epithelial phenotype , we expressed GRAF1 in the BT - 549 cell line of breast cancer origin characterized by the loss of epithelial phenotype . We obtained a signi ﬁ cant decrease in snail - 1 and snail - 2 transcription factors 72 hours after expressing GRAF1 in BT - 549 cell line , as compared to wild - type BT - 549 . A decrease in mesenchymal N - cadherin and an increase in epithelial E - cadherin were also observed . Thus , expression of GRAF1 caused changes in expression levels of the basic mesenchymal and epithelial markers consistent with the recovery of normal epithelial phenotype . A strong indicator of neoplastic transformation in cell lines , which either lost a tumor suppressor or underwent oncogene activation , is the capacity to form anchorage - independent colonies in soft agar . 28 Normal epithelial cells typically are unable to grow in semisolid media in the absence of the cell - matrix contact . In our experimen - tal system , GRAF1 - depleted cells formed multicellular colonies when grown in soft agar gel . These results rein - forced the assumption that GRAF1 is involved in main - taining a normal phenotype . Existing data from the literature are consistent with possible role of GRAF1 as a gene required for Figure 7 . Activity of RhoA and Rac1 in control and GRAF1 - depleted MCF10A cells . ( A ) GRAF1 - depleted MCF10A cells sample showed a 75 % increase in the levels of active RhoA , and a 40 % decrease of active Rac1 , as compared to control samples . The levels of RhoA and Rac1 activity were calculated as mentioned in Materials and Methods and expressed as percent of control . The level of the active RhoA was measured by a pull - down assay , using Rhotekin - RBD coated beads that bind the active ( GTP - bound ) RhoA with high af ﬁ nity . Active Rac1 levels were measured by a pull - down assay , using PAK - PBD coated beads that bind the active ( GTP - bound ) Rac1 , with high af ﬁ nity . ( B ) The Western blot shows the level of active RhoA ( left ) and of active Rac1 ( right ) in the samples of cell lysate from control and shGRAF1 - expressing cells ( upper bands ) . GTP - and GDP - enriched cell lysates ( “ C GTP ” and “ C GDP , ” respectively ) were used as positive and negative controls . Amounts of pulled down , active RhoA and Rac1 were normalized relative to the total RhoA and Rac1 levels respectively , in the corresponding lysates . CELL ADHESION AND MIGRATION 377 maintenance of normal cell phenotype . The GRAF1 gene was found to be disrupted in patients with myelodysplas - tic syndrome , 29 while aberrant methylation of the GRAF1 promoter was detected in patients with acute myeloid leukemia . 30 A recent study shows that a fusion gene between fragments of claudin 18 and GRAF1 , CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 , found in gastric cancer , impairs epithelial integrity and induces EMT . 36 These studies , coupled with our observations , suggest that GRAF1 indeed shares some features with tumor suppressor genes . Possible tumor suppressor function of a protein with Rho GAP activity is not without precedent in the litera - ture . Rho GAP known as DLC1 ( “ deleted in liver can - cer ” ) is considered as a tumor and metastasis suppressor gene for several human cancers . 37 It is demonstrated that tumor suppressor functions of DLC1 depend on its Rho - GAP activity , as well as on some GAP - independent Figure 8 . Inhibition of Rho kinase partially rescues the adhesion phenotype in GRAF1 - depleted cells . ( A ) A gradual increase in cell - cell junction intensity ( upper panel ) and a decrease in focal adhesion area ( lower panel ) were seen during 10 to 60 min incubation of GRAF1 - depleted cells with the Rho - kinase inhibitor Y27632 at a 10 m M ﬁ nal concentration . Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining with anti - E - cadherin and anti - zyxin antibodies . Scale bar : 10 m m . ( B ) The average intensity of E - cadherin staining at the cell - cell junctions in the Y27632 - treated GRAF1 - depleted cells approached 65 % of the E - cadherin intensity at the cell - cell contacts of control cells . ( C ) Focal adhe - sion area ( visualized by staining with antibody to zyxin ) in Y27632 - treated GRAF1 - depleted cells become similar to those seen in control cells treated with Y27632 . 378 M . REGEV ET AL . mechanisms . 38 , 39 , 40 Following the GRAF1 knockdown in MCF10A cells , we observed a signi ﬁ cant increase of RhoA - GTP level , suggesting that function of GRAF1 in preserving the epithelial phenotype might be mediated through its RhoGAP activity . We found also some reduc - tion in Rac1 activity upon the GRAF1 - knockdown , which may re ﬂ ect a known antagonism between Rho and Rac in epithelial cells . 11 Some features of the pheno - type of GRAF1 - depleted cells ( enhancement of focal adhesions and stress ﬁ bers , cell elongation ) can , indeed , be explained by activation of known RhoA pathway effectors , such as Rho - kinase ( ROCK ) . It is worth noting that ROCK is also known to be associated with tumor metastases and poor clinical outcome in breast cancer . 41 We investigated whether treatment of GRAF1 - depleted cells with a ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 could rescue the normal phenotype by blocking the Rho pathway . Our results showed some recovery of the E - cadherin - positive cell - cell junctions in the Y - 27632 treated GRAF1 - depleted cells , but the junctional E - cadherin level was still signi ﬁ cantly lower than that in control cells . Thus , inactivation of ROCK is insuf ﬁ cient for complete recov - ery of the normal epithelial phenotype suggesting that , besides ROCK / Rho - kinase , GRAF1 depletion activates additional effectors , related or non - related to the Rho - pathway . In addition to RhoGAP activity , GRAF1 contains BAR and PH functional domains , which underlay its involvement in the clathrin - independent endocytosis by remodeling membranes into tubulovesicular clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) . 17 Since GRAF1 , as we showed in this study , localized to epithelial cell - cell junc - tions in MCF10A cells , it could in principle regulate the junctional integrity through the control of the E - cad - herin endocytic traf ﬁ cking . Another hypothesis concern - ing the GRAF1 BAR domain function is that GRAF1 may participate in a crosstalk between the Rho activity and membrane tension . It is now becoming increasingly clear that membrane tension plays an important role in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration , 42 , 43 but the mechanisms via which the membrane tension affects the cytoskeletal functions remain elusive . Recent stud - ies 44 , 45 indicate that membrane tension may strongly affect recruiting BAR domain proteins to the membrane - remodeling sites in the cell . Since GRAF1 contains both BAR and RhoGAP domains , this can provide a mecha - nism for the membrane tension dependent local regula - tion of Rho functions . Thus , future studies of GRAF1 may shed light on the basic mechanisms of the membrane - cytoskeleton cross - talk , as well as the major principles governing mainte - nance of the epithelial phenotype and its deterioration in the course of neoplastic transformation .
