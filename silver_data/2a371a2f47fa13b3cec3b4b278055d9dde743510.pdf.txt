An actin shell surrounds these endocytic sites ; however , its structure , com - position , and functional signi ﬁ cance remain elusive . Here , we show that the formin mDia1 , but surprisingly not the Arp2 / 3 complex , is enriched at the membrane inva - ginations generated by L . monocytogenes during HeLa and Jeg - 3 cell infections . Electron microscopy reveals a band of linear actin ﬁ laments that run along the longi - tudinal axis of the invagination membrane . Mechanistically , mDia1 expression is vital for the assembly of this F - actin shell . mDia1 is also required for the recruitment of Filamin A , a caveola - associated F - actin cross - linking protein , and caveolin - 1 to the invaginations . Importantly , mixed - cell infection assays show that optimal caveolin - based L . monocytogenes cell - to - cell spreading correlates with the formation of the linear actin ﬁ lament - containing shell by mDia1 . IMPORTANCE Listeria monocytogenes spreads from one cell to another to colonize tis - sues . This cell - to - cell movement requires the propulsive force of an actin - rich comet tail behind the advancing bacterium , which ultimately distends the host plasma membrane into a slender bacterium - containing membrane protrusion . These mem - brane protrusions induce a corresponding invagination in the membrane of the adja - cent host cell . The host cell that receives the protrusion utilizes caveolin - based endo - cytosis to internalize the structures , and ﬁ lamentous actin lines these membrane invaginations . Here , we set out to determine the structure and function of this ﬁ la - mentous actin “ shell . ” We demonstrate that the formin mDia1 , but not the Arp2 / 3 complex , localizes to the invaginations . Morphologically , we show that this actin is organized into linear arrays and not branched dendritic networks . Mechanistically , we show that the actin shell is assembled by mDia1 and that mDia1 is required for ef ﬁ cient cell - to - cell transfer of L . monocytogenes . KEYWORDS Listeria monocytogenes , actin , cytoskeleton , endocytosis , host - pathogen interactions M etazoan cellular motility and endocytosis rely on the regulated assembly and dynamic organization of actin ﬁ laments ( F - actin ) into branched and linear net - works ( see references 1 to 3 for reviews ) . The bacterial pathogen Listeria monocyto - genes routinely hijacks these actin arrays during its own infections as it invades host cells ( see reference 4 for a review ) , moves within them ( see references 5 and 6 for reviews ) , and ultimately disseminates between them ( see reference 7 for a review ) .

To initially enter nonphagocytic host epithelial cells , L . monocytogenes hijacks the clathrin - mediated endocytic ( CME ) machinery ( 9 – 11 ) and as part of this process , exploits classical CME and actin cytoskeletal components , including the Arp2 / 3 com - plex , to rapidly generate a branched actin - containing endocytic cup ( 9 – 17 ) . Once inter - nalized , the bacteria escape a membrane - containing vacuole to gain access to the host cell cytoplasm . There , L . monocytogenes bacteria utilize their surface - bound effector protein ActA ( 18 , 19 ) to recruit and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , thereby giving rise to a branched actin ﬁ lament network that allows the bacteria to move both intracellularly and intercellularly via comet / rocket tails and membrane protrusions , respectively ( 20 , 21 ) . Although the Arp2 / 3 complex is largely responsible for generating the branched F - actin network of cytoplasmic comet / rocket tails ( 16 , 20 – 22 ) , once motile bacteria engage with the host cell periphery to initiate cell - to - cell spreading , the formin class of actin nucleating proteins also become involved to incorporate linear actin cables within the protrusions ( 23 , 24 ) . This network of branched and unbranched actin ﬁ la - ments ( 23 , 24 ) helps to ef ﬁ ciently propel the bacteria against the host cell plasma membrane as it distends the membrane outwards into a long bacterium - led ﬁ nger - like membrane protrusion . This protrusion pushes against the surface of an adjacent host cell , producing a corresponding membrane invagination that endocytoses the micro - meter - scale bacterium - containing structure through a caveolin - dependent mechanism ( 25 , 26 ) . A requirement for successful L . monocytogenes infections in host organs is the ability of the bacteria to undergo cell - to - cell spreading as infections ( both in vitro and in vivo ) with mutant bacteria that are defective in generating membrane protrusions / invaginations are nonfatal and are often characterized by signi ﬁ cantly diminished organ colonization ( 19 , 27 – 31 ) . Interestingly , we recently reported on the existence of a thin F - actin shell closely surrounding these pathologically vital bacterially induced membrane invaginations ( 26 ) . However , its structural organization and functional sig - ni ﬁ cance in the context of L . monocytogenes infections are not known . Here , we set out to investigate how and why such an actin shell surrounds L . mono - cytogenes membrane invaginations during the cell - to - cell dissemination of the bacte - ria . Using light and electron microscopy , infection assays and loss - of - function approaches , we show that these large endocytic structures are coated by parallel linear actin ﬁ laments assembled by the formin mDia1 . These membrane invaginations con - tain the caveola - associated F - actin - binding proteins Filamin A and myosin 1c ( Myo1c ) . Importantly , proper formation of an mDia1 - nucleated F - actin coat is crucial for the recruitment of Filamin A and caveolin - 1 and for optimal cell - to - cell spreading of L . monocytogenes . Taken together , our ﬁ ndings demonstrate a new role for formins and linear actin ﬁ laments during noncanonical micro - sized caveolin - based endocytic events and shed new light on the molecular mechanisms driving L . monocytogenes intercellular dissemination . RESULTS mDia1 but not the Arp2 / 3 complex is enriched along with F - actin at membrane invaginations induced by L . monocytogenes . F - actin has been shown to surround L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations in HeLa cells ( 26 ) . As cell - to - cell spreading is crucial for placental colonization by L . monocytogenes ( 27 , 28 , 30 , 32 ; see also reference 33 for a review ) , we decided to con ﬁ rm these ﬁ ndings in Jeg - 3 cells , a routinely utilized placental epithelial cell line ( 34 – 36 ) . To do this , we used mixed - cell assays ( 26 , 36 – 38 ) whereby infected Jeg - 3 cells were overlaid onto uninfected cells expressing the F - actin - binding peptide LifeAct - eGFP ( enhanced green ﬂ uorescent protein ) . Under these conditions , LifeAct clearly outlined the membrane invaginations present at the L . monocytogenes secondary infection sites in the recipient cells ( Fig . 1A ) . These results support that the formation of an F - actin shell is not a cell line - speci ﬁ c phenomenon . To characterize this F - actin accumulation in more detail , we plotted the intensity Dhanda et al . ® November / December 2021 Volume 12 Issue 6 e02939 - 21 mbio . asm . org 2 FIG 1 The Arp2 / 3 complex does not localize to L . monocytogenes actin - rich membrane invaginations .

These analyses revealed two LifeAct peaks , indicative of LifeAct at the mem - brane invagination , surrounding a single phalloidin peak , originating from the actin - rich core of the membrane protrusion ( Fig . 1B and B ’’ ; see also Fig . S1A to S1D ’’ in the supplemental material ) . Heat maps also showed an increase in LifeAct signal intensity at the membrane invaginations compared with the surrounding cytoplasm ( Fig . 1B ’ ) . Rearrangement of the eukaryotic plasma membrane during large - scale and small - scale endocytic processes is largely facilitated by branched actin ﬁ lament arrays nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex 9 ( 39 – 42 ; see also reference 2 for a review ) . Thus , we next set out to immunolocalize the Arp2 / 3 complex ( speci ﬁ cally targeting the ARPC2 / p34 subunit ) at sites of L . monocytogenes intercellular spread . Surprisingly , we found no obvious enrichment of endogenous ARPC2 / p34 around the L . monocytogenes - induced membrane invaginations during Jeg - 3 cell infections ( Fig . 1C ) . Rather , line scan analysis showed ARPC2 / p34 concentrated within the actin - rich core of the mem - brane protrusions ( Fig . 1C ’ and C ’’ ) . The same also held true in HeLa cells where endog - enous ARPC2 / p34 failed to localize at membrane invaginations labeled with the L . monocytogenes membrane invagination marker CD147 - GFP ( 37 ) ( Fig . 1D to D ’’ ) . To cor - roborate these observations , we utilized the mixed - cell assay . Again , we found no obvious enrichment of Emerald GFP - tagged ARPC2 / p34 ( p34 - Emerald ) at L . monocyto - genes - induced membrane invaginations when p34 - Emerald was expressed in mem - brane invagination - forming Jeg - 3 cells ( Fig . 1E ) . In keeping with this , line scan analysis of p34 - Emerald at the area of the membrane invaginations produced a low nonde - script level of signal across the entire scanned area ( Fig . 1E ’ and E ’’ and Fig . S1E to S1F ’’ ) . Similar results were also obtained during HeLa cell infections ( Fig . 1F to F ’’ and Fig . S1G to S1H ’’ ) , which ensured that our ﬁ ndings were not cell type speci ﬁ c . The expected localization of p34 - Emerald at other L . monocytogenes actin - rich structures such as actin clouds , cytoplasmic comet / rocket tails , and membrane protrusions in the invagination - forming cells also con ﬁ rmed that p34 - Emerald was expressed and local - ized properly ( Fig . S1I ) . The absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations suggests that the actin shell surrounding the invaginations might be organized as unbranched ( linear ) actin rather than a branched ( dendritic ) network . We thus studied the localization of mDia1 , a major formin protein ( 43 , 44 ) that is highly expressed in epithelial cells ( 44 – 46 ) , at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations . We found that endogenous mDia1 accumulated at bacterial cell - to - cell spreading sites in Jeg - 3 cells ( Fig . 2A ) . Line scan analysis of endogenous mDia1 at the membrane protrusion / invagi - nation produced the two peaks ﬂ anking a single F - actin peak ( Fig . 2B to B ’’ ) . We used a mixed Jeg - 3 cell assay to verify that the host cell forming the bacterial membrane inva - gination accounted for the observed enrichment of mDia1 . Consistent with the above data , we saw elevated levels of mDia1 - Emerald delineating the entire length of the FIG 1 Legend ( Continued ) with NucBlue ( blue ) to visualize host DNA as well as any bacteria within the invaginations .

Heat maps con ﬁ rmed this result , and line scan analysis of mDia1 - Emerald at the invaginations generated the characteristic double peak sur - rounding phalloidin - labeled F - actin ( Fig . 2C to C ’’’ and Fig . S2A to S2B ’’ ) . As expected , mDia1 - Emerald also accumulated in a linear - like fashion at the invaginations when we examined membrane invaginations formed in HeLa cells ( Fig . 2D to D ’’’ and Fig . S2C to S2D ’’ ) . Although exogenously expressed mDia1 has been previously identi ﬁ ed within L . monocytogenes protrusions ( 47 ) , we noticed a lack of endogenous mDia1 within the actin - rich core of membrane protrusions engaged in intercellular spreading ( Fig . 2B ) . However , membrane protrusions that extended outwards into extracellular space and were not actively engaged with a neighboring host cell routinely contained elevated levels of mDia1 within their actin - rich cores ( Fig . S2E ) . The enrichment of mDia1 at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations did not coincide with alterations in the en - dogenous levels of the protein following 8 - h infections of Jeg - 3 or HeLa cells com - pared to uninfected samples ( Fig . S2F and S2G ) . To quantify the frequency by which L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations accumulate mDia1 , we examined mDia1 - Emerald in membrane invagination - forming host cells that were also stained with CD147 , a host transmembrane glycoprotein re - ceptor that labels L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations ( 37 ) . We determined that ; 85 % of CD147 - positive L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations were delineated with mDia1 - Emerald ( Fig . 2E and E ’’ ) . In contrast , only ; 4 % of CD147 - positive mem - brane invaginations contained weakly elevated p34 - Emerald levels ( Fig . 2E ’ to E ’’ ) , while the Emerald vector alone failed to localize to the CD147 - positive membrane inva - ginations ( Fig . 2E ’’ ) . Together , these results support the speci ﬁ city of mDia1 recruit - ment to the endocytic sites . Of note , F - actin ( LifeAct ) also accumulated at a high fre - quency ( ; 89 % ) ( Fig . 2F to F ’ ) . Collectively , these data point toward mDia1 and F - actin as bona ﬁ de host components of L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations . Next , we assessed the presence and localization of mDia1 at various structures of - ten formed during the bacterial cell - to - cell spreading process . We ﬁ rst examined sites where the bacterium - containing membrane protrusion initially contacts a neighboring host cell membrane and deforms it into a characteristic invagination shape . At these sites ( termed “ Early ” ) , mDia1 - Emerald marked the tip of the invagination , gradually decreasing in intensity distal to the tip ( Fig . S3A ) . The staining also showed the expected double peak in staining intensity across the nascent invagination ( Fig . S3A ’ to S3A ’’ ) . Occasionally , these “ early ” membrane invaginations contained a single bright punctum of mDia1 at their tips ( Fig . S3B to B ’’ ) . We then examined membrane invagi - nations that were deeper in the neighboring host cells . At these invaginations we often observed a thin trailing streak ( a tether ) at the distal end of the invaginations that pre - sumably resulted from the close interaction of the plasma membrane as it wrapped around the internalized bacterium prior to its scission and release of the bacterium - containing double - membrane vacuole . mDia1 - Emerald and F - actin routinely concen - trated at these tethers ( Fig . S3C to S3E ) . This is in line with a recent study that showed caveolin - 1 also present at the tether - like structures ( 26 ) . Finally , we examined encircled L . monocytogenes that were presumably generated following a scission event . Those structures were positive for both mDia1 and F - actin ( Fig . S3F to S3G ’’ ) .

Dhanda et al . ® November / December 2021 Volume 12 Issue 6 e02939 - 21 mbio . asm . org 6 An mDia1 - dependent linear F - actin shell coats L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations . The presence of mDia1 at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations raises the possibility that the actin surrounding the structures is organized into linear arrays . To examine this , we used transmission electron microscopy . We found that lin - ear actin ﬁ laments lined the cytoplasmic area of the invaginations , appeared short in length , and were often arranged in parallel fashion while also forming a layer not exceeding three ﬁ laments in thickness ( Fig . 3A to E ) . Next , we made use of myosin sub - fragment 1 ( S1 ) to examine the orientation of the actin ﬁ laments . When cross sections of the invaginations were examined in glycerol - extracted and tannic acid - treated cells , in which the myosin S1 had not reached the ﬁ laments , the cytoplasmic side of the invagination membranes showed electron - dense clusters studded along the plane of the invagination membrane in what appeared to be close - packed formations , which are characteristic of parallel actin ( Fig . 3F to H ) . In cells where the actin ﬁ laments were decorated with S1 , we found that the barbed ends of the linear actin arrays surround - ing the bacterial membrane invagination were oriented opposite to the direction of bacterial spread ( Fig . 3I ) . This is in agreement with ﬁ ndings in a recent study showing F - actin accumulating toward the basal region of the protrusion / plasma membrane of the invagination - forming host cell ( 38 ) . Given that some formins are able to both nu - cleate and elongate linear actin ﬁ laments ( 43 , 44 ) and because mDia1 is expressed at high levels in many epithelial cell lines ( 45 , 46 ) , the observed enrichment of mDia1 within the actin shell suggests that its recruitment could be either a prerequisite for its assembly or a consequence of it . To investigate this issue , we took advantage of a well - characterized stable mDia1 knockdown HeLa cell line ( 45 ) . Western blotting con ﬁ rmed that the mDia1 protein lev - els were reduced by ; 90 % in the mDia1 - depleted cells compared to control cells ( Fig . S4A and B ) . Upon infection , cytosolic L . monocytogenes could still generate actin clouds , comet / rocket tails , and membrane protrusions in the mDia1 knockdown cells ( data not shown ) . These results con ﬁ rm a previous study in which the pan - formin in - hibitor SMIFH2 or the small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - mediated depletion of mDia for - mins were employed ( 47 ) . However , because L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions are reported as being ; 25 % shorter in mDia1 - depleted cells ( 47 ) , these defective pro - trusions might in ﬂ uence the morphology of the membrane invaginations . Thus , to assess the role of mDia1 at the bacterial membrane invaginations , we utilized mixed - cell assays by preinfecting control short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) cells with L . monocyto - genes and then mixing the infected cells with uninfected mDia1 knockdown cells . Bacterial cell - to - cell spreading events revealed that the bacterial membrane protru - sions could still induce the formation of membrane invaginations in mDia1 - depleted cells . Yet , these membrane invaginations were no longer surrounded by F - actin ( Fig . 4A ) as also shown by line scan analysis of the LifeAct signal across the membrane invaginations ( Fig . 4A ’ to A ’’ ) . Interestingly , we also observed a dramatic reduction in caveolin - 1 levels at the invaginations that formed in the mDia1 - depleted cells ( Fig . 4B to B ’’ ) . Importantly , this was not due to a reduction in whole - cell caveolin - 1 protein lev - els ( Fig . S4C ) . To con ﬁ rm that the F - actin coat lining the membrane invaginations assembles inde - pendently of the Arp2 / 3 complex , we took advantage of the fact that the ablation of the Arpc2 gene ( encoding ARPC2 / p34 ) results in the downregulation of several other Arp2 / 3 complex subunits , including Arp2 and Arp3 ( 48 ) . As L . monocytogenes is unable to generate comet / rocket tails in an established line of Arpc2 2 / 2 ﬁ broblasts ( 48 , 49 ) , we preinfected wild - type cells with L . monocytogenes and then overlaid these cells onto culture dishes containing either uninfected wild - type cells or Arpc2 2 / 2 cells transfected with mDia1 - Emerald or ﬂ uorescent LifeAct . These experiments revealed the presence of both mDia1 and F - actin ( LifeAct ) at the membrane invaginations generated in either wild - type or Arp2 / 3 knockout host cells ( Fig . S4D and E ) . More importantly , the reexpression of mDia1 in the mDia1 knockdown cells could rescue the F - actin coat at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations . The presence of F - actin at the invaginations was evident in the mDia1 knockdown cells cotransfected Parallel Actin at Listeria Membrane Invaginations ® November / December 2021 Volume 12 Issue 6 e02939 - 21 mbio . asm . org 7 FIG 3 Electron microscopic examination and myosin S1 decoration of linear actin ﬁ laments surrounding L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations .

Rescue of caveolin - 1 localization at mem - brane invaginations also occurred in mDia1 knockdown cells transfected with mDia1 - Emerald and caveolin - 1 - mCherry ( Fig . 4E and F ) . The sum of these data indicates that an mDia1 - dependent linear F - actin coat sur - rounds L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations and that this in ﬂ uences the pres - ence of caveolin - 1 at these endocytic structures . The linear F - actin coat of L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations contains caveola - associated F - actin - binding proteins . The dependence of caveolin - 1 localiza - tion on mDia1 and F - actin as well as the regular spacing of the linear actin ﬁ laments that make up the coat at bacterial membrane invaginations prompted us to look at Filamin A and myosin 1c , which are established caveola - associated F - actin - binding pro - teins ( 50 – 54 ; see reference 55 for a review ) . Using our mixed HeLa cell assay , we found that both Filamin A - Emerald and Myo1c - GFP were enriched along the entire length of the L . monocytogenes membrane invagi - nations ( Fig . 5A ) . These observations were con ﬁ rmed in Jeg - 3 cells ( Fig . 5B ) . Line scan analysis of Filamin A - Emerald and Myo1c - GFP at the structures also generated the characteristic double peak surrounding actin ( Fig . 5C and D ’ ) . Filamin A - Emerald and Myo1c - GFP localization also remained throughout the length of invaginations that were connected to the cell edge via thin membranous tethers ( Fig . S5A to S5B ’’ ) . In good agreement with the localization of mDia1 and F - actin at the structures , ; 79 % and ; 97 % of the CD147 - positive membrane invaginations on average were also posi - tive for Filamin A and Myo1c , respectively ( Fig . 5E and F ’ ) . Strikingly , the presence of Filamin A , but not Myo1c , at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations heavily relied on mDia1 and , by extension , the presence of the F - actin coat ( Fig .

As expected , both actin - binding proteins were recruited to L . monocyto - genes membrane invaginations generated in Arpc2 2 / 2 cells ( Fig . S6G to L ’’ ) . Thus , although two caveola - associated actin - binding proteins decorate L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations , only the recruitment of Filamin A to these noncanonical cav - eolin - rich endocytic structures relies on an mDia1 - assembled F - actin coat . Consistent with these conclusions , Filamin A - Emerald also decorated the actin clouds surrounding immotile bacteria ( Fig . S5C ) and the comet / rocket tails necessary for L . mono - cytogenes intracellular motility ( Fig . S5C ) , the latter as previously reported ( 56 ) . Moreover , Filamin A - Emerald was also enriched within the bacterial membrane protrusions ( Fig . S5D ) . In line with the reported localization of Myo1c to the plasma membrane and actin - rich membrane structures ( 53 , 54 , 57 – 62 ) , we observed elevated levels of Myo1c - GFP at the plasma membrane surrounding L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions ( Fig . S5E ) . However , Myo1c - GFP did not accumulate at cytoplasmic actin clouds or comet / rocket tails ( Fig . S5F ) . Interestingly , there was an obvious increase in Myo1c - GFP signal at bacterial cell - to - cell spreading sites engaging two Myo1c - GFP - expressing cells ( Fig . S5G ) . The presence of Myo1c - GFP at both the membrane protrusion and membrane invagina - tion most likely accounts for the observed increase in signal intensity . Optimal L . monocytogenes cell - to - cell spread relies on mDia1 expression in the membrane protrusion - receiving cells . We next wanted to determine the importance of mDia1 and by extension F - actin accumulation at L . monocytogenes membrane inva - ginations during bacterial intercellular spreading . To test this , we utilized mixed - popu - lation cell - to - cell spreading assays ( 25 , 63 ) in which CellTracker Blue - labeled control HeLa cells preinfected with L . monocytogenes were mixed with unlabeled ( and unin - fected ) control or mDia1 knockdown HeLa cells . In this way , we quanti ﬁ ed the number of bacteria that spread out of an individual infected CellTracker Blue - labeled cell directly into the surrounding unlabeled cells . We determined that , on average , 66 % of bacteria spread out of the blue - labeled protrusion - forming cells , when these cells were surrounded by control invagination - forming cells ( Fig . 6A and B ) . Interestingly , bacte - rial spreading dropped to ; 47 % when the surrounding invagination - forming cells were depleted of mDia1 ( Fig . 6A and B ) . Normalized , this corresponds to a signi ﬁ cant 30 % reduction in bacterial spreading ( Fig . 6C ) . We also enumerated the average num - ber of non - CellTracker Blue - labeled infected cells per foci : ; 10 cells were infected per focus in samples containing control invagination - forming cells , whereas only ; 7 infected cells per focus were observed when the surrounding host cells were depleted of mDia1 ( Fig . 6D ) , hence a 25 % reduction ( Fig . 6E ) . Of note , we also saw several infec - tion foci that contained an innumerable number of bacteria packed within the protru - sion - forming host cell ( Fig . 6F ) . We observed a similar phenotype when the infection foci contained caveolin - 1 - or epsin - 1 - depleted cells ( 26 ) . FIG 5 Legend ( Continued ) invagination - forming host cells .

We determined the ratio of the infected area to the area of the CellTracker Blue - labeled protrusion - forming cell . We chose to do this because when infection foci are compared to one another within the same experimental group , the presence of larger or smaller cells could skew focus area determinations , even if the proportion of spreading bacte - ria is equivalent between different foci . By means of postacquisition thresholding and delineation of labeled L . monocytogenes , a mask encapsulating the bacteria associated with both the protrusion - forming and invagination - forming cells was obtained ( Fig . 6G ) . We also delineated the area of the labeled protrusion - forming cell using a similar approach . We then determined the ratio of the area of infection to the area of the labeled protrusion - forming cell and found that it was reduced by about 40 % when the invagination - forming cells were depleted of mDia1 ( Fig . 6H ) . Taken together , these ﬁ ndings point toward a key role for the accumulation of mDia1 and F - actin at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations during bacterial cell - to - cell spreading events . DISCUSSION Investigation into the mechanisms driving L . monocytogenes cell - to - cell spreading have historically ( as well as recently ) focused on processes that occur in the membrane protrusion - forming infected host cell , leaving the corresponding invagination - forming host cells poorly studied . Here , we set out to characterize the structure , composition , and role of the F - actin coat surrounding L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations . We show that these large caveolin - rich invaginations are surrounded by a shell of lin - ear actin ﬁ laments that are polymerized by the formin mDia1 . Crucially , bacterial inter - cellular spreading is signi ﬁ cantly decreased when membrane invagination - forming host cells are depleted of mDia1 . Our ﬁ nding that mDia1 is responsible for the generation of the actin shell that coats L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations represents a paradigm shift for three main rea - sons . First , it is well - known that the Arp2 / 3 complex and branched actin assembly are required throughout the L . monocytogenes infectious cycle of epithelial cells , including its initial entry into cells ( 12 , 13 , 16 ) , evasion of host autophagic pathways ( 64 – 66 ) , intracellu - lar motility ( 16 , 20 – 22 , 49 , 67 ) , and cell - to - cell spreading ( 68 , 69 ) . It is thus unexpected that the formation and proper function of the caveolin - rich membrane invaginations mediating L . monocytogenes endocytosis rely exclusively on mDia1 and linear actin ﬁ la - ments . Of note , a previous study has suggested that L . monocytogenes exploits host for - mins during the formation of membrane protrusions , although formins are not essential and appear to cooperate with the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 47 ) . Moreover , in that study , cell - to - cell spreading was reduced by almost 40 % when mDia1 was silenced in both the protru - sion - forming and invagination - forming host cells . Remarkably , the decrease in bacterial spreading that we report upon knockdown of mDia1 in only the invagination - forming host cells closely mimics the above ﬁ ndings . This suggests that mDia1 has a negligible role in the protrusion - forming host cells . This is in line with the fact that mDia1 does not localize to or affect the formation of comet / rocket tails ( 47 ) . Furthermore , we could not detect a concentration of mDia1 at the L . monocytogenes - induced membrane protru - sions that engaged neighboring cells . We conclude that the main role of mDia1 dur - ing bacterial cell - to - cell spreading is to optimize L . monocytogenes endocytosis by generating an actin - rich coat that keeps caveolin - 1 in place at the invaginated host plasma membrane . Second , our discovery that the actin shell at L . monocytogenes membrane invagina - tions consists of mDia1 - dependent actin ﬁ laments provides the ﬁ rst example of the involvement of linear F - actin during the endocytosis of large cargoes . L . monocyto - genes is not the only microbial pathogen that exploits formin proteins , as formins are acknowledged players during the Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent formation of membra - nous protrusions that allow the capture and entry of micro - sized particles such as bac - teria from the extracellular milieu through phagocytosis and related processes ( 70 – 74 ) . Dhanda et al . ® November / December 2021 Volume 12 Issue 6 e02939 - 21 mbio . asm . org 14 Plasma membrane invaginations leading to nano - sized spherical or tubular vesicles are commonly associated with branched actin arrays and the Arp2 / 3 complex , with the for - mation of clathrin - coated vesicles from both clathrin - coated pits ( 39 , 40 , 75 ; see also reference 2 for a review ) and ﬂ at clathrin - coated plaques ( 41 ) providing the best - char - acterized examples . In addition , other endocytic pathways resulting in nano - sized vesicles such as fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) and the CLIC / GEEC ( cla - thrin - independent carriers [ CLIC ] , glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored proteins [ GPI - AP ] - enriched early endosomal compartments [ GEEC ] ) pathways also depend on actin polymerization by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( see reference 2 for a review ) . It is only recently that evidence of a metazoan formin - dependent endocytic process has come to light . In hippocampal neurons , the formation of nano - sized synaptic vesicles occurs via a cla - thrin - independent and formin ( mDia1 ) - dependent pathway ( 76 ) . Thus , their and our ﬁ ndings suggest that not only the Arp2 / 3 complex but also formins can contribute to the formation of both nano - and micro - sized endocytic vesicles . This begs the question as to whether and how the linear actin ﬁ laments assembled by mDia1 power large micro - sized endocytic processes . It is also worth noting that L . monocytogenes mem - brane invaginations clearly differ from typical endocytic membrane invaginations as they are subjected to the pushing forces generated by the incoming bacterial mem - brane protrusions . Thus , such forces may replace those arisen from branched actin po - lymerization by the Arp2 / 3 complex , thus explaining its absence at the bacterial endo - cytic sites . Finally , the physical link between caveolin - 1 and linear actin ﬁ laments found at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations has an unanticipated functional signi ﬁ cance . Indeed , caveolae are tethered to stress ﬁ bers as part of actin - regulated mechanosensi - tive pathways ( see reference 55 for a review ) . mDia1 - dependent stress ﬁ bers are crucial for proper caveola organization and inward movement of the carriers as knockdown of mDia1 decreases the pool of stress ﬁ ber - coaligned caveolin - 1 and leads to the forma - tion of caveolin - 1 clusters at the cell surface ( 77 ) . In contrast , mDia1 - mediated actin as - sembly is required to recruit and / or retain caveolin - 1 at the invagination sites where L . monocytogenes - containing membrane protrusions are internalized . Thus , although L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations and caveolae share some molecular compo - nents ( caveolin - 1 , Filamin A , Myo1c , and linear F - actin ) , they appear to be regulated by different mechanisms . We propose a model of bacterial cell - to - cell spreading whereby a bacterial mem - brane protrusion utilizes actin ﬁ laments to push L . monocytogenes toward a neighbor - ing host cell , thus deforming its cell surface . This sets in motion the formation of a bac - terial membrane invagination enriched in caveolin - 1 and its associated proteins to promote the endocytosis of the bacterium - containing membrane protrusion ( 25 , 26 ) . As actin is being polymerized , Filamin A and Myo1c are recruited to link the growing ﬁ laments to the membrane of the invagination ( Fig . 7 ) . In particular , Filamin A could directly link caveolin - 1 ( 55 , 56 ) found embedded within the membrane of the invagina - tions ( 26 ) to the underlying actin coat . Our ﬁ nding that the loss of mDia1 and concomi - tant loss of Filamin A , F - actin , and caveolin at invaginations does not remove Myo1c suggests Myo1c could in fact bridge the thin ﬁ lamentous actin coat and the lipid bilayer of the invagination itself by way of its N - terminal actin - binding motor domain ( 78 ) and C - terminal phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) - binding pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain ( 59 ) . Indeed , our recent observation that phosphoinositides and phosphatidylserine cluster at L . monocytogenes invaginations ( 26 ) lends credence to this possibility . Furthermore , Filamin A along with a - actinin - 1 and a - actinin - 4 , two other F - actin - cross - linking proteins that accumulate at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations ( 36 , 38 ) , could impart additional rigidity ( 79 ) to the mDia1 - nucleated actin coat and keep it localized close to the plasma membrane as the invagination deepens . In summary , our work demonstrates that the assembly of a linear F - actin coat regu - lates the micro - sized caveolin - mediated endocytic events that allow L . monocytogenes Parallel Actin at Listeria Membrane Invaginations ® November / December 2021 Volume 12 Issue 6 e02939 - 21 mbio . asm . org 15 to spread between host cells . This is the ﬁ rst evidence of linear actin ﬁ laments being used for the internalization of a caveolin - mediated endocytic structure and draws par - allels to the branched actin networks that are assembled at sites of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Most importantly , this work opens the door for investigations into the role of linear F - actin arrays at other large micro - sized internalization events as well as classical nano - sized caveolin - based endocytic processes .

The Listeria monocytogenes strain EGD BUG 600 was used throughout this study and grown at 37°C using either brain heart infusion ( BHI ) agar or broth ( BD Biosciences ) . L . monocytogenes infections . To infect cells , 2 - ml overnight ( 12 to 16 h ) shaken ( at 225 rpm ) broth cultures of L . monocytogenes were diluted 10 - fold in fresh BHI broth ( at a ﬁ nal volume of 10 ml ) and then incubated at 37°C in a shaking incubator ( at 225 rpm and approximately a 70° angle ) until the cul - ture reached an optical density reading of A 600 of 1 . 00 ( ; 2 h of subculturing ) . At an A 600 of 1 . 00 , 1 ml of bacteria was centrifuged for 5 min at 9 , 600 (cid:1) g ( 25°C ) . Prewarmed ( 37°C ) 1 (cid:1) PBS [ - / - ] was then added to FIG 7 Proposed model of mDia1 and caveola - associated F - actin - binding proteins at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations . Proposed model ( modi ﬁ ed from reference 26 ) demonstrating the organization of linear actin together with mDia1 , Filamin A , and Myo1c . An L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion containing the bacteria together with its actin - rich tail is formed in the “ green cell ” ( labeled “ Protrusion - forming cell ” in the model ) . The membrane protrusion is endocytosed by the “ pink cell ” ( labeled “ Invagination - forming cell ” in the model ) using a caveolin - based invagination . Linear actin ﬁ laments are depicted surrounding the membrane invagination with mDia1 nucleating and then growing the ﬁ laments . Filamin A and Myo1c link the parallel actin ﬁ laments to the plasma membrane of the invagination . Caveolae at the surface of the “ pink cell ” that are not exploited by the L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion / invagination are labeled in the model as “ Caveolae . ” Dhanda et al . ® November / December 2021 Volume 12 Issue 6 e02939 - 21 mbio . asm . org 16 the pellet , and the bacteria were spun down for 5 min at 9 , 600 (cid:1) g . PBS washing was repeated two addi - tional times . After the ﬁ nal PBS wash , the pelleted bacteria were resuspended with 1 ml of prewarmed serum - free medium ( DMEM or MEM ; 37°C ) and then diluted 100 to 1 , 000 times . The diluted bacteria were added onto culture plates containing host cells and incubated for at least 6 to 8 h to study actin comet / rocket tail and membrane protrusion / invagination formation . L . monocytogenes mixed - cell infections . One batch of host cells was seeded at a density of 2 (cid:1) 10 6 per well in six - well format plates without coverslips . On the same day , in separate six - well plates ( con - taining coverslips ) , a second batch of host cells was seeded at a density of 2 . 25 (cid:1) 10 6 per well . The fol - lowing day , the host cells seeded previously at a density of 2 . 25 (cid:1) 10 6 were transfected ( as described below ) with DNA plasmids encoding the ﬂ uorescently tagged protein of interest to be examined at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations . On day 3 , the untransfected host cells ( seeded previously at a density of 2 (cid:1) 10 6 per well ) were infected ( as described above ) with wild - type L . monocytogenes at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of ; 40 . At 2 h postinfection , the infected cells were washed three times with PBS [ - / - ] , and then 1 ml of prewarmed media containing 10 % FBS and gentamicin ( 50 m g / ml ) was added into each well to kill any remaining extracellular bacteria . After 3 h of infection , the infected cells were detached and enumerated as described previously ( 26 , 81 ) . Approximately 1 (cid:1) 10 6 infected cells were then overlaid onto well plates containing the previously uninfected / transfected cells . Gentamicin was added to a ﬁ nal concentration of 50 m g / ml . Samples were ﬁ xed 5 to 6 h following the overlaying procedure and stained as described below . The examination of ﬂ uorescently tagged proteins of interest at L . monocytogenes spreading events was performed by microscopic analysis of infection events where untransfected but infected cells were sending out L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions directly into ( and generating invaginations within ) the adjacent transfected cells ( as visually determined by the microscopist through a combination of ﬂ uorescent and phase - contrast microscopy ) . Care was taken to ensure that each membrane protrusion could be visually traced back to the original sending ( untrans - fected cell ) . L . monocytogenes mixed - cell spreading assay . On day 1 , control shRNA protrusion - forming cells ( to be infected later with L . monocytogenes ) were initially seeded into six - well format plastic plates ( with - out glass coverslips ) at a density of 3 . 0 (cid:1) 10 5 . Also on day 1 , 3 . 0 (cid:1) 10 5 control shRNA and shmDia1 inva - gination - forming cells were seeded into separate six - well format plastic plates ( without glass coverslips ) . These numbers were selected so that the con ﬂ uence of each well reached ; 100 % on day 3 ( the day of infection ) . On the day of the infections ( 2 days postseeding ) , culture plates containing the control shRNA protrusion - forming cells were rinsed ﬁ ve times with prewarmed PBS with Ca 2 1 and Mg 2 1 ( PBS [ 1 / 1 ] ) , and then 0 . 8 ml of fresh prewarmed serum - free DMEM was added to each well . After this , 0 . 2 ml of the 1 , 000 (cid:1) diluted bacteria ( as described above ) was added to each well . The well plates were then spun down in a centrifuge for 2 min at 214 (cid:1) g and then placed in a 37°C incubator for 2 h . After 2 h , the infected cells were washed three times with prewarmed PBS [ 1 / 1 ] , and then 1 ml of DMEM contain - ing 10 % FBS , 20 m M CellTracker Blue ( to label the cells ) , and 50 m g / ml gentamicin ( to kill any extracellu - lar bacteria ) were added to each well . The plates were then incubated for 45 min in a 37°C incubator . After these 45 min , the now CellTracker Blue - labeled infected cells were rinsed ﬁ ve times with pre - warmed PBS [ 1 / 1 ] and then detached from the wells . At the same time , the control shRNA and shmDia1 invagination - forming cells were also rinsed ﬁ ve times with prewarmed PBS [ 1 / 1 ] and then detached from the wells . Both cell populations were detached as described previously ( 26 , 81 ) . To the pelleted cells , 1 ml of fresh prewarmed DMEM containing 10 % FBS and 50 m g / ml gentamicin ( per well collected ) was added in order to resuspend the cells . A ratio of 1 : 12 . 5 ( protrusion - forming cells to invagi - nation - forming cells ) was used when combining the two cell populations . The following volume of cells was then added per well of a 24 - well format plastic plate ( containing glass coverslips and pre ﬁ lled with 1 ml of DMEM containing 10 % FBS and 50 m g / ml gentamicin ) : 10 m l of protrusion - forming cells and 135 m l of invagination - forming cells ( either unlabeled control shRNA or shmDia1 ) . After combining the two cell populations , we spun down the culture plates in a centrifuge for 2 min at 214 (cid:1) g and then allowed the infections to proceed for 9 h in order to allow the bacteria to suf ﬁ ciently spread out of the CellTracker Blue - labeled protrusion - forming cells into surrounding ( and unlabeled ) invagination - forming cells . After 9 h , the samples were ﬁ xed and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS [ - / - ] as described below . The L . monocytogenes bacteria were detected with rabbit anti - L . monocytogenes antibodies fol - lowed by secondary antibody labeling with Alexa Fluor 594 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit antibodies . To determine the proportion of spreading bacteria per infection focus , the number of bacteria present within the con ﬁ nes of the invagination - forming cells was divided by the total number of bacteria con - tained within the entire infection focus . If required , additional ﬁ elds of view were captured in order to enumerate all of the bacteria within a distinct infection focus . To determine the number of infected host cells per infection focus , host cells infected with bacteria were manually enumerated . This was accom - plished using a combination of ( i ) examining bacterial actin - rich structures ( actin clouds , comet / rocket tails , and membrane protrusions ) generated by the bacteria within the host cells and ( ii ) general visual detection of distinct host cells by their cell borders ( via F - actin staining ) and nuclei ( via phase - contrast microscopy ) . Determination of the ratio of the area of infection to the area of the protrusion - forming cell was performed based on the methods described by Talman and colleagues ( 82 ) . Reagents and antibodies . Antibodies and reagents used in this study included the following : Alexa Fluor 594 - and 488 - conjugated phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) , CellTracker Blue ( 20 m M for mixed population spreading assay ; Invitrogen ) , Alexa Fluor 594 - and 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit and goat anti - mouse antibodies ( 2 m g / ml ; Invitrogen ) , rabbit anti - mDia1 ( 2 . 07 m g / ml for immuno ﬂ uorescence ; Proteintech Group , 20624 - 1 - AP [ human targeting ] ) , rabbit anti - p34 ( 10 m g / ml for immuno ﬂ uorescence ; MilliporeSigma , 07 - 227 - I - 100UG ) , mouse anti - CD147 ( 10 m g / ml for immuno ﬂ uorescence ; Abcam , ab666 ) , rabbit anti - Parallel Actin at Listeria Membrane Invaginations ® November / December 2021 Volume 12 Issue 6 e02939 - 21 mbio . asm . org 17 caveolin - 1 ( 1 m g / ml for Western blot ; Abcam , ab2910 ) , mouse anti - a - tubulin ( 1 : 1 , 000 for Western blot ; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , 12G10 ) , rabbit anti - L . monocytogenes ( 1 : 300 for immuno ﬂ uores - cence , ; BD Difco , 223021 ) , and horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated goat anti - mouse and goat anti - rab - bit antibodies ( 1 m g / ml ; Invitrogen ) . Immunolocalization . Cells on glass coverslips were ﬁ xed at room temperature ( in the dark ) for 15 min using prewarmed ( 37°C ) 3 % paraformaldehyde ( prepared in 150 mM NaCl , 4 mM Na / K PO 4 , 5 . 0 mM KCl [ pH 7 . 3 ] ) and then washed three times using PBS [ - / - ] . Cells were permeabilized using room tempera - ture 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 5 min or 2 20°C acetone for 10 min . Following Triton X - 100 permeabilization , coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS [ - / - ] , whereas acetone - treated cover - slips were left to dry at room temperature for 30 min . All samples were blocked with 5 % normal goat serum { prepared in TPBS / BSA ( PBS [ - / - ] , 0 . 5 % Tween 20 , and 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin [ BSA ] } for 25 min and then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies also prepared in TPBS / BSA . The next day , cov - erslips were washed three times with TPBS / BSA for 10 min and then treated with secondary antibodies ( Alexa Fluor 594 - or 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or goat anti - mouse ; prepared in TPBS / BSA ) at room temperature ( in the dark ) for 2 h . To visualize F - actin , samples were treated with Alexa Fluor 594 - or 488 - con - jugated phalloidin ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 10 min . Samples were washed three times with PBS [ - / - ] and mounted onto glass microscope slides using ProLong glass antifade mountant with NucBlue STain ( P36981 ; Invitrogen ) . Lysate preparation and Western blotting . Cells were washed ﬁ ve times with prewarmed PBS [ 1 / 1 ] and then treated on ice for 5 min with prechilled ( 4°C ) radioimmunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris [ pH 7 . 4 ] , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 1 % deoxycholic acid , 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate [ SDS ] ) containing the cOmplete Mini EDTA - free protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Cell scrapers were used to help disrupt the cells . The cell lysates were then collected into pre - chilled ( 4°C ) microcentrifuge tubes . The lysates were spun at 4°C and 10 , 000 (cid:1) g for 10 min to pellet any cellular debris and nucleic acids ; the supernatants were collected into fresh prechilled ( 4°C ) microcentri - fuge tubes , ﬂ ash frozen using liquid nitrogen , and then immediately stored in a 2 80°C freezer . Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) assay kit ( Pierce ) . For Western blotting , lysate samples were prepared using 6 (cid:1) Laemmli buffer and then boiled ( at 100°C ) for 10 min . Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels and resolved by electrophoresis . Gels were rinsed in distilled water for 5 min and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Trans - Blot SD semidry transfer cell ( Bio - Rad ) . Membranes were washed for 5 min in TBST ( Tris - buffered saline , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) with shaking , blocked with 4 % Blotto ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) prepared in TBST ( 1 - h shaking ) , and then treated with primary antibodies ( diluted in TBST containing 1 % BSA ) over - night at 4°C . The next day , membranes were rinsed three times with TBST for 10 min and then three times with TBST for 5 min prior to incubation with secondary antibodies ( HRP - conjugated goat anti - rab - bit or goat anti - mouse ) for 1 h at room temperature . To visualize protein bands , membranes were treated with Western Lightning Plus - ECL ( PerkinElmer ) following the manufacturer ’ s instructions imaged using a Fuji ﬁ lm LAS - 4000 imager ( Fuji ﬁ lm ) . To con ﬁ rm equivalent loading , membranes were stripped using mild stripping buffer ( 1 . 5 % glycine , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Tween 20 [ pH 2 . 2 ] ) and reprobed using the mouse anti - a - tubulin targeting antibody . Western blot quanti ﬁ cation . Protein quanti ﬁ cation was performed using the 16 - bit image ﬁ les and the “ gels ” tool in ImageJ . All analyzed lanes were ﬁ rst adjusted for loading by normalizing the loading control signal of each lane against the signal of a randomly selected lane ( “ lane x ” ) . Following this , the mDia1 signal for each lane was also normalized against the mDia1 signal of “ lane x . ” To obtain the adjusted and relative mDia1 protein levels of each lane , the relative mDia1 signal of each lane was di - vided by the relative loading control of that same lane . DNA constructs . Plasmids containing mEmerald - mDia1 , mEmerald - ARPp34 , mEmerald - Filamin A , mCherry - Caveolin - 1 ( 83 ) , mKate - LifeAct , eGFP - LifeAct ( gifts from Michael Davidson ; plasmid 54156 , plas - mid 53997 , plasmid 54098 , plasmid 55008 , plasmids 54697 and 54610 , respectively ) were obtained from Addgene . The plasmid encoding CD147 - GFP was generated previously ( 84 ) . The plasmid encoding Myo1c - GFP was obtained from Ana - Maria Lennon - Duménil ( acquired via Kristine Schauer ) . Cell culture transfections . All DNA transfections of cultured cells were performed using the jetPEI ( for HeLa and Jeg - 3 cells ) or jetPRIME ( for MEF cells ) transfection reagents ( Polyplus Transfection ) and carried out according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Brie ﬂ y , the prepared DNA transfection reagent mixture was pipetted dropwise onto cultured cells contained in six - well format plates . The cells were then placed inside an incubator ( 37°C ) for 4 h . Following this , the culture medium was replaced , and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h at 37°C to allow for suf ﬁ cient expression of the transfected plasmid cDNA product . Electron microscopy . For standard electron microscopy , Jeg - 3 cells were grown on transwell mem - branes ( Falcon , product number 353095 ; Corning , USA ) placed within 24 - well format plastic cell culture plates ( Costar , product number 3524 ; Corning , USA ) . Medium was replaced with ﬁ xative ( 1 . 5 % parafor - maldehyde , 1 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate [ pH 7 . 3 ] at room temperature [ rt ] ) for 2 to 3 h , and then the ﬁ xative was replaced with buffer ( 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate [ pH 7 . 3 ] [ rt ] ) . The mem - branes , with attached cells , were then cut into pieces approximately 1 . 5 cm by 1 . 5 cm . The pieces were placed in glass vials and washed two times ( 10 min per wash ) with fresh buffer . The samples were post - ﬁ xed for 1 h on ice with 1 % osmium tetroxide in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate ( pH 7 . 3 ) . The samples were washed three times ( 10 min each wash ) with double - distilled water ( ddH 2 O ) ( rt ) and then stained en bloc with 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate ( rt ) . The membranes were again washed three times with ddH2O ( rt ) and then dehydrated through an ascending series of ethyl alcohols ( 30 % , 50 % , 70 % , 95 % , and 100 % twice [ 10 min each time ] ) followed by two treatments with propylene oxide ( 15 min each ) . The samples Dhanda et al . ® November / December 2021 Volume 12 Issue 6 e02939 - 21 mbio . asm . org 18 were then placed in 1 : 1 propylene oxide - EMBED 812 resin ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hat ﬁ eld , PA ) and left overnight . The next day , the membranes were passed through two changes of 100 % EMBED 812 resin and then placed on glass slides with the cells face up . Embedding capsules were ﬁ lled with resin and inverted onto the membranes , and then the slides with membranes and embedding capsules were placed in an oven ( 60°C ) for the resin to polymerize for 48 h . After polymerization , the capsules ( with embedded cells ) were carefully separated from the membranes that remained attached to the slides . The cell layers at the surfaces of the block were sectioned en face using a Leica EM UC6 ultrami - crotome ﬁ tted with Ultra - AMF 3 . 00 - mm diamond knife ( DiATOME ) and collected onto copper grids . The sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then imaged using a Talos L120C trans - mission electron microscope ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) operated at 120 kV . S1 decoration . For extraction and S1 decoration , Jeg - 3 cells were grown on transwell membranes ( Falcon , product number 353095 ; Corning , USA ) placed within 24 - well format plastic cell culture plates ( Costar , product number 3524 ; Corning , USA ) . Cells were brie ﬂ y washed with suspension buffer ( 10 mM Na phosphate , 135 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl , 2 mM EDTA [ pH 7 . 0 ] ) and then extracted with the buffer con - taining 5 % ( wt / vol ) glycerol for 1 min ( rt ) . The extraction buffer was replaced with 2 mg / ml S1 ( made up by diluting the stock solution of S1 [ 3 . 3 mg / ml of rabbit psoas S1 myosin ; catalog no . CS - MYS04 , Cytoskeleton , Inc . , USA ] with suspension buffer ) and the cells incubated ( rt ) for 15 min . Cells were brie ﬂ y washed with buffer and then immediately ﬁ xed in 10 mM Na phosphate buffer containing 1 % glutaral - dehyde and 0 . 2 % tannic acid ( Mallinckrodt ) ( pH 7 . 0 ) for 30 min ( rt ) . The ﬁ xative was replaced with 10 mM phosphate buffer , and then the membranes were cut from the transwells , placed in glass vials , and stored overnight ( rt ) . The membranes were washed two times with 10 mM Na phosphate buffer ( 10 min per wash ) and then post ﬁ xed for 1 h on ice in buffer containing 1 % OsO4 . The membranes were washed three times with ddH 2 O ( rt ) and then post ﬁ xed , en bloc stained , dehydrated , and in ﬁ ltrated with resin as indicated above . The membranes were placed on ﬂ at silicon supports with the cells face up . Embedding capsules were ﬁ lled with resin , inverted onto the membranes , and then placed in an oven ( 60°C ) to polymerize . After polymerization , the capsules with membranes still attached were separated from the silicon supports , and the blocks were trimmed . Blocks were sectioned through the membrane until the cell layer was reached , and then sections were collected , stained , and imaged as indicated above . Immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopy . A Leica DMI4000B ( Leica Microsystems ) inverted ﬂ uorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca R2 charge - coupled - device ( CCD ) camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) was used to acquire all immuno ﬂ uorescent images . All devices were controlled by the MetaMorph Imaging System software ( Universal Imaging ) . All images were acquired using a 100 (cid:1) oil immersion objective ( (cid:1) 1 , 000 magni ﬁ cation overall ) . Images were evaluated and processed using Metamorph Imaging System software or ImageJ . The pixel intensity plots ( line scan analyses ) were per - formed using ImageJ by the microscopist whereby the line tool was used to ﬁ rst draw a 1 . 5 - to 2 . 5 - m m line perpendicularly across the structures . Following this , the “ plot pro ﬁ le ” tool was used to obtain the pixel intensity value ( from 0 to 255 ) of the protein of interest and actin . Lines were excluded or shifted if intense signal from cellular structures ( such as stress ﬁ bers ) , random artifacts , or other nearby invagi - nations interfered with the pro ﬁ le of interest . Line scan analyses were replicated at least three times ( and up to six times ) for each protein examined . Heat maps of the representative images were gener - ated by applying the “ inferno ” LUT ( look up table ) to the corresponding 8 - bit image ﬁ le using ImageJ . In these heat maps , intensity values range linearly from 0 ( low ) to 255 ( high ) , with the highest level of protein signal represented as yellow . The signal intensity then decreases successively from orange to red then purple and ﬁ nally black ( a pixel intensity of 0 ) . Statistical analysis . Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 6 . 01 . All results involving immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopy , line scan analyses , and Western blotting were obtained from experiments performed at least three times ( n = 3 ) . All presented images are representative of the experiments performed . See also the corresponding ﬁ gure legends for information regarding the quanti - ﬁ cation of protein localization frequency at membrane invaginations , Western blotting ( protein levels ) , bacterial spreading assays ( the exact number of bacteria enumerated and samples / ﬁ eld of views ana - lyzed ) , and whether or not measurements were normalized to controls .
