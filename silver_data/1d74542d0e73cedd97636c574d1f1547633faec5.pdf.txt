Holt , PhD 1 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) accounts for the majority of deaths from chronic lower respiratory dis - eases , the third leading cause of death in the United States in 2015 and the fourth leading cause in 2016 . * Major risk factors include tobacco exposure , occupational and environmental exposures , respiratory infections , and genetics . † State varia - tions in COPD outcomes ( 1 ) suggest that it might be more common in states with large rural areas . To assess urban - rural variations in COPD prevalence , hospitalizations , and mortal - ity ; obtain county - level estimates ; and update state - level varia - tions in COPD measures , CDC analyzed 2015 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( BRFSS ) , Medicare hospital records , and death certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System ( NVSS ) . Overall , 15 . 5 million adults aged ≥18 years ( 5 . 9 % age - adjusted prevalence ) reported ever receiving a diagnosis of COPD ; there were approximately 335 , 000 Medicare hospitalizations ( 11 . 5 per 1 , 000 Medicare enrollees aged ≥65 years ) and 150 , 350 deaths in which COPD was listed as the underlying cause for persons of all ages ( 40 . 3 per 100 , 000 population ) . COPD prevalence , Medicare hospi - talizations , and deaths were significantly higher among persons living in rural areas than among those living in micropolitan or metropolitan areas . Among seven states in the highest quartile for all three measures , Arkansas , Kentucky , Mississippi , and West Virginia were also in the upper quartile ( ≥18 % ) for rural residents .

Prevalence of diagnosed COPD was estimated using the 2015 BRFSS survey , an annual state - based , random - digit – dialed cellular and landline telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized U . S . population aged ≥18 years § that is conducted by state health departments in collaboration with CDC . In 2015 , the median survey response rate for the 50 states and District of Columbia ( DC ) was 46 . 6 % and ranged from 33 . 9 % to 61 . 1 % . ¶ Diagnosed COPD was defined as an affirmative response to the question “Has a doctor , nurse , or other health professional ever told you that you had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD , emphysema , or chronic bronchitis ? ” State analyses included 426 , 838 ( 98 . 3 % ) respondents in the 50 states and DC after exclusions for missing information on COPD or age ( Table 1 ) . Urban - rural analyses included 426 , 736 ( 98 . 2 % ) respondents after excluding those who had missing informa - tion for COPD , age , or county code . § https : / / www . cdc . gov / brfss / annual _ data / annual _ 2015 . html . ¶ Response rates for BRFSS are calculated using standards set by American Association for Public Opinion Research response rate formula 4 . The response rate is the number of respondents who completed the survey as a proportion of all eligible and likely eligible persons . http : / / www . aapor . org / AAPOR _ Main / media / publications / Standard - Definitions20169theditionfinal . pdf . Response rates in 2015 for individual states are available at https : / / www . cdc . gov / brfss / annual _ data / 2015 / pdf / 2015 - sdqr . pdf . A multilevel regression and poststratification approach ( 4 ) was used to estimate model - predicted COPD prevalence for U . S . counties in 2015 . High internal validity was determined by comparing modeled estimates with actual unweighted BRFSS survey estimates in 1 , 507 counties with ≥50 respon - dents ( Pearson correlation coefficient = 0 . 68 ; p < 0 . 001 ) , and with weighted BRFSS survey estimates in 195 counties with ≥500 respondents and relative standard errors < 0 . 30 ( Pearson correlation coefficient = 0 . 74 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . Medicare enrollment records and data from 100 % of Part A ( inpatient hospital ) claims in 2015 were obtained from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services . Analyses were limited to 30 , 212 , 024 living Medicare Part A enrollees aged ≥65 years who were eligible for fee - for - service hospitalizations on July 1 , 2015 , and all 335 , 362 fee - for - service inpatient hospital claims with a first - listed diagnosis of COPD that were submitted in 2015 for Medicare Part A enrollees aged ≥65 years . COPD was defined by International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Edition , Clinical Modification ( ICD - 9 - CM ) codes 490 – 492 or 496 or ICD - 10 - CM codes J40 – J44 . * * Urban - rural analyses were lim - ited to 335 , 102 ( 99 . 9 % ) hospital claims . * * International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Edition , Clinical Modification ( ICD - 9 - CM ) codes for COPD include 490 ( bronchitis , not specified as acute or chronic ) , 491 ( chronic bronchitis ) , 492 ( emphysema ) , or 496 ( chronic airway obstruction ) ; ICD - 10 - CM codes include J40 ( bronchitis , not specified as acute or chronic ) , J41 ( simple and mucopurulent chronic bronchitis ) , J42 ( unspecified chronic bronchitis ) , J43 ( emphysema ) , or J44 ( other COPD ) . Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report MMWR / February 23 , 2018 / Vol . 67 / No . 7 207 US Department of Health and Human Services / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Mortality data for all ages were analyzed using CDC WONDER , an interactive public - use Web - based tool . †† CDC WONDER mortality data from NVSS contain information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and DC . CDC WONDER queries generated numbers of deaths , age - adjusted death rates , 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) , and population denominators for groups defined by state and the 2013 NCHS urban - rural classification of decedents . Deaths caused by COPD were defined by ICD - 10 codes J40 – J44 , in which COPD was the underlying cause of death on the death certificate . CDC also obtained population estimates for 2015 from CDC WONDER to calculate the percentage of U . S . and state residents who lived in a rural county as classified by the NCHS 2013 urban - rural county classification .

For BRFSS analyses , statistical software was used to account for the complex sampling design . Differences in COPD preva - lence among rural respondents compared with those of other urban - rural subgroups were determined by t - tests . Urban - rural differences in Medicare hospitalizations and death rates were determined by the Z - test . All two - sided tests were considered statistically significant at a = 0 . 05 . In 2015 , approximately 15 . 5 million adults aged ≥18 years ( unadjusted prevalence = 6 . 3 % and age - adjusted preva - lence = 5 . 9 % ) had self - reported diagnosed COPD . County - level estimates of COPD prevalence ranged from 3 . 2 % to 15 . 6 % ( Figure ) . U . S . counties within the highest quartile of county - level estimates ( 8 . 5 % - 15 . 6 % ) tended to be located in nonmetropolitan areas of Alabama , Arizona , Arkansas , Georgia , Kentucky , Maine , Michigan , Missouri , Ohio , Oklahoma , Tennessee , and West Virginia ( Figure ) .

There was a consistent pattern for significantly higher estimates of COPD measures from all three independent data systems among adults living in rural areas than among those living in micropolitan or metropolitan areas . Overall 5 . 9 % of U . S . residents lived in rural counties in 2015 . State - specific percentages of rural residents ranged from zero percent in Connecticut , Delaware , District of Columbia , New Jersey , and Rhode Island to 34 . 7 % in Montana ( Table 2 ) . State - specific age - adjusted prevalence of COPD among adults aged ≥18 years in 2015 ranged from 3 . 8 % in Utah to 12 . 0 % in West Virginia .

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 210 MMWR / February 23 , 2018 / Vol . 67 / No . 7 US Department of Health and Human Services / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention addition to the major risk factors for COPD , which include tobacco smoke , environmental and occupational exposures , respiratory infections , and genetics , correlates include older ages , low socioeconomic status , and asthma history ( 5 , 6 ) . Rural populations might have higher COPD risk because these populations have a greater proportion with a history of smoking ( 3 ) , more secondhand smoke exposure but less access to smoking cessation programs , § § and higher proportions of uninsured or lower socioeconomic residents , which might have limited access to early diagnosis , treatment , and management of COPD . ¶¶ Rural respiratory exposures might include mold spores , organic toxic dust , and nitrogen dioxide , which are associated with COPD risk ( 7 ) . COPD management includes efforts to slow declining lung function , improve exercise tolerance , and prevent and treat exacerbations . Treatments include pulmonary rehabili - tation , oxygen therapy , and medications . Smoking cessation programs , routine influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations , regular physical activity , and reductions in occupational and environmental exposures are also important . Barriers to health care in rural areas include cultural perceptions about seeking care , travel distance , absence of services , and financial burden ( 8 ) . Access to early diagnosis , prompt treatment , and manage - ment of COPD by a pulmonologist is difficult for rural adults with COPD because of limited geographic accessibility to this COPD specialty ( 9 ) . Therefore , much of the COPD in rural areas is diagnosed and managed by primary care provid - ers ( 9 ) . Level of care and patient - physician communication might vary , given that 27 % of adults with COPD symptoms in 2016 reported that they had not talked with their physi - cian about these symptoms ( 10 ) . In a primary care physician survey , 71 % said that they would use spirometry to assess patients with COPD symptoms , but they also reported that important barriers to diagnosing COPD included patient failure to report COPD symptoms or smoking history , poor treatment adherence , more immediate competing health issues , and diagnostic procedure costs ( 10 ) . Whereas 68 % of primary care physicians were aware that pulmonary rehabilitation programs were available to their patients , only 38 % routinely prescribed this therapy for COPD patients ( 10 ) . However , rural areas might have limited availability to these programs . Provision of online health care services ( i . e . , telemedicine ) in rural areas could reduce some of these barriers by providing health education and support websites to patients and caregiv - ers , appointment assistance , and ability to check assessment results online ; however , lack of Internet access is still a barrier in some rural populations ( 8 ) . § § http : / / www . lung . org / assets / documents / research / cutting - tobaccos - rural - roots . pdf . ¶¶ http : / / www . countyhealthrankings . org / reports / key - findings - 2016 . The findings in this report are subject to at least eight limita - tions . First , self - reported diagnosed COPD in BRFSS cannot be validated with medical records and might be subject to recall and social desirability biases ; however , urban - rural variations in prevalence were similar to Medicare claims . Second , the BRFSS study population does not include adults who live in long - term care facilities , prisons , and other facilities ; thus , findings are not generalizable to those populations . Third , state BRFSS response rates were relatively low , and response rates cannot be obtained by urban - rural classification . This might have resulted in overestimates or underestimates of COPD prevalence ; however , a strength is that BRFSS provides large , stable sample sizes for all six urban - rural classifications . Fourth , the assumption that the six urban - rural classifications reflect consistent types of distinct populations and social environ - ments within and across each state could potentially be incor - rect . Fifth , county - level estimates are modeled and based on population characteristics such as distributions of older adults in the county ; furthermore , it is not known how previous or current local interventions ( e . g . , tobacco cessation policies and programs ) might have affected current COPD prevalence . Sixth , Medicare claims should not be interpreted as unique prevalent cases because some might reflect readmissions ; however , these COPD estimates do reflect the actual Medicare burden for hospital facilities , pulmonary rehabilitation services , health care providers , caregivers , and other resources . Seventh , both Medicare hospital claims and death certificates might be subject to reporting preferences for certain diseases as the first - listed or underlying cause if there is a consistent regional or urban - rural preference . Finally , although the data reported here show higher COPD hospitalization and death rates for rural populations , they do not assess whether hospitalization and death rates among patients with COPD vary by urbanicity . Higher burdens of COPD among rural U . S . residents highlight needs for continued tobacco cessation programs and policies to prevent COPD and improve pulmonary function among smokers . Known barriers to care in rural areas suggest a need for improved access for adults with COPD to treatment strategies ( pulmonary rehabilitation and oxygen therapy ) and comprehensive chronic disease self - management programs . Health care providers and community partners who serve rural residents can help adults with COPD increase access to and participation in health care interventions . Federal agencies are promoting collaborative and coordinated efforts to educate the public , providers , patients , and caregivers about COPD and improve the prevention , diagnosis , and treatment of COPD .

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report MMWR / February 23 , 2018 / Vol . 67 / No . 7 211 US Department of Health and Human Services / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Summary What is already known about this topic ? Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is a leading cause of death and has been diagnosed in 15 . 5 million adults in 2015 in the United States . Risk factors include tobacco expo - sure , occupational and environmental exposures , respiratory infections , and genetics . What is added by this report ? In 2015 , rural U . S . residents had higher age - adjusted prevalence of COPD , of Medicare hospitalizations , and deaths caused by COPD than did residents living in micropolitan or metropolitan areas . Several states with the highest percentages of rural populations also had the highest estimates for all three measures . What are the implications for public health practice ? Additional efforts are needed to prevent risk factors and overcome barriers to early diagnosis , and the appropriate treatment and management of COPD . Improving access to such health care might improve quality of life and reduce hospital readmissions among COPD patients and reduce COPD mortality . access to online communities , develop clinical decision tools for primary health care providers , and conduct research to improve access to care for COPD in hard - to - reach areas . Promoting these efforts has the potential to improve quality of life for COPD patients and reduce hospital readmissions and COPD mortality .
