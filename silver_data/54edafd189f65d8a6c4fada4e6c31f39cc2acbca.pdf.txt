We have examined the speciﬁcity and potency of the drug by assaying its effects on the actin - activated MgATPase assay of diverse members of the myosin superfamily . Blebbistatin potently inhibits several striated muscle myosins as well as vertebrate nonmuscle myosin IIA and IIB with IC 50 values ranging from 0 . 5 to 5 l M . Interestingly , smooth muscle which is highly homologous to vertebrate nonmuscle myosin is only poorly inhibited ( IC 50 ¼ 80 l M ) . The drug potently inhibits Dictyostelium myosin II , but poorly inhibits Acanthamoeba myosin II . Blebbistatin did not inhibit representative myosin superfamily members from classes I , V , and X . Introduction The human genome contains about 40 myosin genes representing 12 of the 18 described classes ( Berg et al . , 2001 ) . In addition to their role as force transducers in muscle contraction , myosins participate in a host of cellular functions including cytokinesis , endocytosis , movement of intracellular vesicles , maintenance of stereocelia or microvillar integrity and capping of surface receptors ( Sellers , 1999 ; Kieke and Titus , 2003 ) . Numerous myosin isoforms are linked to familial human diseases such as deafness , cardiomyopathy , nephritis , neurological dysfunction and blood disorders ( Avraham , 2003 ; Konhilas and Leinwand , 2003 ) . Most cells express numerous myosin isoforms with separate localizations and functions . Some myosins are expressed in most cell types while others are speciﬁc for specialized cells such as hair cells or photoreceptor cells . Cell permeable , high aﬃnity , small molecule inhibitors would be very useful to study the function of individual myosins in such a complex setting , especially if inhib - itors could be found that are speciﬁc for a particular myosin gene product or class . A screen of a chemical library has recently revealed an inhibitor of the nonmuscle myosin IIA ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) . This compound , termed blebbistatin , inhibits cytokinesis , alters the smooth movement of ﬁsh keratocytes and inhibits the spontaneous blebbing of a cell line lacking ﬁlamin . It is cell permeable and its eﬀects are reversible upon washout of the drug . Blebbistatin was shown to inhibit the MgATPase activ - ity and in vitro motility of nonmuscle myosin IIA . At 50 l M concentration , it dramatically inhibited the actin - activated MgATPase activity of nonmuscle myo - sin IIB and rabbit fast skeletal muscle subfragment one ( S1 ) ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) . Interestingly , it did not eﬀectively inhibit the actin activated MgATPase activity of smooth muscle heavy meromyosin ( HMM ) at this concentration showing that it did not inhibit the activity of all myosin II isoforms . There was little inhibition of the activity of several other myosin class members such as myosin I , myosin V or myosin X , even at 100 l M concentration . In the present study we have examined the dose dependency of inhibition of the actin - activated MgATPase activity of a greatly expanded pool of myosins and ﬁnd that blebbistatin is an effective inhibitor of some , but not all , class II myosins . No inhibition was found of other myosin class members tested . Experimental procedures Preparation of proteins Turkey gizzard smooth muscle myosin HMM was prepared as described ( Sellers , 1985 ) . Nonmuscle myo - sin IIA HMM ( Hu et al . , 2001 ) , nonmuscle myosin IIA S1 ( Kovacs et al . , 2003 ) , nonmuscle myosin IIB HMM ( Pato et al . , 1996 ) and myosin V S1 ( Wang et al . , 2000 ) * To whom correspondence should be addressed : Tel : 301 - 496 - 6887 ; Fax : 301 - 402 - 1542 ; E - mail : sellersj @ nhlbi . nih . gov Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility 25 : 337 – 341 , 2004 . 337 (cid:1) 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers .

Myosin X HMM was engineered from a bovine myosin X clone and expressed in baculovirus ( Chen et al . , manuscript in preparation ) . Phosphorylated Acantha - moeba myosin IC , dephosphorylated Acanthamoeba myosin II and RLC - phosphorylated Dictyostelium myo - sin II were a gift of Ed Korn ( NIH ) , porcine b - cardiac muscle myosin S1 was a gift of Richard Moss ( Univer - sity of Wisconsin ) , rat myosin Ib was a gift of Michael Ostap ( University of Pennsylvania ) and scallop muscle myosin S1 was a gift of Andrew Szent - Gyo¨rgyi ( Bran - deis University ) . Myosin light chain kinase ( Adelstein and Klee , 1981 ) , calmodulin ( Klee , 1977 ) and rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) were prepared as previously described . Actin - activated MgATPase assay Actin - activated MgATPase activity was measured using an NADH - coupled assay in a Beckman DU 640 spectro - photometer ( Wang et al . , 2003 ) . Blebbistatin [ a racemic mixture of the ( + ) and ( ) ) enantiomers ] was added from stocks dissolved in DMSO and the DMSO concentration was maintained at a constant concentration of 5 % in all samples . In Vitro Motility Assay In vitro motility assays were performed as described in a buﬀer consisting of 50 mM KCl , 20 mM MOPS , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP with 50 mM DTT , 2 . 5 mg / mL glucose , 0 . 05 mg / mL glucose oxidase and 2 l g / mL catalase added to retard photobleaching ( Sellers et al . , 1993 ) . Actin was labeled with either rhodamine phalloidin or with a mixture of rhodamine phalloidin and Alexa - 488 phalloidin as described ( Sellers et al . , 1993 ) . In vitro motility was measured using an Olympus IX70 microscope equipped for both epiﬂuorescence and total internal reﬂection ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Sakamoto et al . , 2003 ) . For examination of the movement of rhodamine phalloidin - labeled F - actin , the sample was illuminated by 532 nm light and the ﬂuorescence was observed in the epiﬂuorescence mode . Transient kinetic analysis of MantATP binding The rate of ATP binding to NMIIA S1 was measured in a Kintek stopped - ﬂow spectroﬂuorimeter at 25E . Results Blebbistatin has been shown to inhibit the enzymatic activities of HMM fragments of nonmuscle myosin IIA , nonmuscle myosin IIB and of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin S1 , but not smooth muscle myosin ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) . We examined the dose dependency of the inhibition of the actin activated MgATPase activity of these and other myosin II isoforms . Blebbistatin potently inhibited the activity of fast rabbit skeletal muscle S1 with a half maximal inhibition at 0 . 5 l M concentration ( Figure 1A ) . Two additional sarcomeric myosin II iso - forms were also assayed . Porcine b - cardiac myosin S1 and scallop striated muscle S1 were inhibited with slightly higher IC 50 values ( 1 . 2 and 2 . 3 l M , respectively ) ( Figure 1A ) . The effect of blebbistatin on inhibition of the actin activated MgATPase activity of nonsarcomeric myosin II isoforms were also studied . The IC 50 values for each of these nonmuscle myosin IIA and IIB HMM frag - ments were 5 . 1 and 1 . 8 l M , respectively ( Figure 1B ) . In contrast , the actin activated MgATPase of the closely related smooth muscle HMM required considerably higher blebbistatin concentrations for inhibition ( IC 50 of about 80 l M ) ( Figure 1B ) . Myosins from two lower eukaryotic amoebae , Acan - thamoeba castellani and Dictyostelium discoideum have been particularly well studied ( Brzeska and Korn , 1996 ) . Since the actin - activated MgATPase activity of both myosins is inhibited by phosphorylation of their heavy chains , myosins with unphosphorylated heavy chains were studied ( Brzeska et al . , 1996 ) . The regulatory light chain of Dictyostelium myosin was also phosphorylated in order to obtain maximally activated myosin . Blebb - istatin inhibited the actin - activated MgATPase activity of Dictyostelium myosin with an IC 50 of 4 . 9 l M , but only poorly inhibited the activity of Acanthamoeba myosin ( IC 50 ¼ 83 l M ) ( Figure 1C ) . The effect of blebbistatin on the actin - activated MgATPase activity of several unconventional ( nonclass II ) myosins was also measured . These include rat myosin 1b , Acanthamoeba myosin IC , mouse myosin Va S1 , and bovine myosin X S1 ( Figure 1D ) . No inhibition was observed with these myosins even at 100 l M blebbist - atin . Similarly , no signiﬁcant inhibition was detected with human myosin XV S1 ( data not shown ) . Blebbist - atin does not compete with ATP for binding to myosin as shown in Figure 2 . This ﬁgure shows the time course of the increase in MantATP ﬂuorescence that occurs when this nucleotide binds to NMIIA S1 . The rate of binding is not aﬀected by 50 l M blebbistatin . Blebbistatin also inhibited the in vitro motility activity of HMM fragments of skeletal muscle myosin , NMIIA . Table 1 .

This suggests that the blebbistatin - inhibited state of myosin does not result in the forma - tion of a strongly bound rigor - like molecule which would have a dominant slowing eﬀect on the movement of the actin ﬁlament by the other , uninhibited myosin molecules . Actin ﬁlaments remain attached to the surface in the fully inhibited state , indicating that the inhibited molecules still retain the ability to interact at least weakly with actin ﬁlaments . Similar behavior is seen with unphosphorylated smooth muscle myosin that does not move actin ﬁlaments , but tethers them to the surface through interactions of the weak binding M . ADP . Pi state with actin ( Cuda et al . , 1997 ) . This suggests that the blebbistatin inhibited myosin probably interacts only weakly with actin and does not interfere with the ongoing movement of the remaining uninhib - ited myosin at intermediate concentrations . Discussion Blebbistatin represents an effective inhibitor of some class II myosins with IC 50 values ranging from submi - cromolar to nearly 100 l M . The basis for the range of potency is not obvious from an evolutionary standpoint . Eﬃcient inhibitions of both vertebrate and molluscan striated muscle myosins were obtained , but potent inhibition was also observed with some nonmuscle myosin II class molecules . In contrast , smooth muscle myosin II was poorly inhibited by blebbistatin . Phylo - genetic analysis has shown that the heavy chain gene for smooth muscle myosin is more closely related to those of NMIIA and NMIIB than to any striated muscle myosin 0 20 0 20 40 60 80 100 nonmuscle myosin IIB nonmuscle myosin IIA smooth muscle myosin [ Blebbistatin ] , µ M 0 5 10 15 20 % M a x i m a l M g A T P a s e A c t i v i t y 0 20 40 60 80 100 % M a x i m a l M g A T P a s e A c t i v i t y % M a x i m a l M g A T P a s e A c t i v i t y % M a x i m a l M g A T P a s e A c t i v i t y β - cardiac myosin 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 0 20 40 60 80 100 Acanthamoeba myosin II Dictyostelium myosin II 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 myosin 1b myosin X myosin V myosin IC [ Blebbistatin ] , µ M [ Blebbistatin ] , µ M [ Blebbistatin ] , µ M skeletal muscle myosin scallop myosin 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 ( A ) ( B ) ( D ) ( C ) Fig . 1 .

The assays for NMIIA HMM , NMIIB HMM and smooth muscle HMM contained 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 l M calmodulin and 2 ng / mL myosin light chain kinase . NMIIB HMM was assayed at 37 (cid:2) C ; Dictyostelium myosin II and Acanthamoeba myosin II were assayed with 25 l M actin , 25 mM KCl , 4 mM MgCl 2 ; Acanthamoeba myosin IC was assayed at 3 l M actin . The data shown is from a single experiment with each myosin , but is representative of at least two independent experiments with each myosin . 339 heavy chain gene ( Berg et al . , 2001 ) . Vertebrate smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosin II isoforms are all regulated by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains in contrast to vertebrate striated muscle myosins ( Sellers , 1999 ) . Therefore it is interesting that blebbist - atin has only a weak inhibitory activity towards smooth muscle myosin . Smooth muscle tissue from a smooth muscle myosin knock - out mouse generates tension suggesting that nonmuscle myosin isoforms may paly some role in smooth muscle contraction ( Morano et al . , 2000 ) . Blebbistatin may be a useful tool to dissect the relative contributions of these two subclasses of myosin in smooth muscles . Two other inhibitors of myosin II class molecules are available . 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime ( BDM ) is a low afﬁnity reagent which inhibits skeletal muscle myosin II ( Higuchi and Takemori , 1989 ) , but is ineffective against several other myosins including nonmuscle myosin IIA and myosin V ( Ostap , 2002 ) and has effects on several nonmyosin molecules ( Sellin and Mcardle , 1994 ) . A screen for small molecule inhibitors of skeletal muscle myosin II uncovered N - benzyl - p - toluene sulphonamide ( BTS ) as an effective inhibitor ( Cheung et al . , 2002 ) . This molecule inhibits rabbit skeletal muscle myosin II much more potently than other myosin II molecules , but its aﬀects on other myosin classes have not been reported . Blebbistatin did not inhibit the activity of myosins from any other class of myosin assayed . This should be interpreted with caution , however , as we assayed a limited number of myosins from only a few of the 18 possible classes ( I , II , V , X , XV ) . Given the variable efﬁciency of inhibition of class II myosins , one should not rule out the possibility that blebbistatin might inhibit other myosins until further examination . The results of the in vitro motility assays suggest that blebbistatin - inhibited myosin is trapped in a weakly bound state , which does not resist the movement of actin ﬁlaments by uninihibited myosins , but still interacts weakly with actin . This implies that to stop a cellular process driven by myosin II , it will be necessary to inhibit most of the myosin interacting with the actin ﬁlament by using blebbistatin concentrations higher than the IC 50 values reported in this work .
