This Viewpoint of infectious aerosols is intended to inform appropriate infection control measures to protect health - care workers . Studies of cough aerosols and of exhaled breath from patients with various respiratory infections have shown striking similarities in aerosol size distributions , with a predominance of pathogens in small particles ( < 5 µm ) . These are immediately respirable , suggesting the need for personal respiratory protection ( respirators ) for individuals in close proximity to patients with potentially virulent pathogens . There is no evidence that some pathogens are carried only in large droplets . Surgical masks might offer some respiratory protection from inhalation of infectious aerosols , but not as much as respirators . However , surgical masks worn by patients reduce exposures to infectious aerosols to health - care workers and other individuals . The variability of infectious aerosol production , with some so - called super - emitters producing much higher amounts of infectious aerosol than most , might help to explain the epidemiology of super - spreading . Airborne infection control measures are indicated for potentially lethal respiratory pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 . Introduction The global pandemic of COVID - 19 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [ SARS - CoV - 2 ] ) has been associated with infections and deaths among health - care workers . 1 There have been conflicting recommendations from health authorities on the use of masks or respirators to protect health - care workers . 2 – 4 When I first reviewed personal respiratory protection against tuberculosis for health - care workers more than 20 years ago , 5 there was very little infor mation on infectious aerosols . Since then , colleagues in various disciplines have provided a wealth of data . The purpose of this Viewpoint is to review the scientific literature on the aerosols generated by individuals with respiratory infections , and to discuss how these data inform the optimal use of masks , respirators , and other infection - control measures to protect health - care workers from those aerosols . This is not a review of the literature on the use of surgical masks or respirators , as several have been done already . 6 – 11 Traditional view of infectious aerosols Current infection control policies are based on the premise that most respiratory infections are transmitted by large respiratory droplets—ie , larger than 5 µm— produced by coughing and sneezing , then deposited onto exposed fomite or mucosal surfaces . 12 Proximity has often been considered a proxy for respiratory droplets , 13 , 14 reflected by statements such as “Proximity to the index case was associated with transmission which is consistent with droplet spread . ” 15 Airborne transmission has often been attributed to infectious droplet nuclei produced by the desiccation of suspen - ded droplets , and defined as 5 µm or smaller in size . This has been thought to occur only for tuberculosis and a few other pathogens . Thus , surgical masks have been recommended for use against most respiratory infections . Particles and plumes Infectious aerosols are suspensions of pathogens in particles in the air , subject to both physical and biological laws . Particle size is the most important determinant of aerosol behaviour . Particles that are 5 µm or smaller in size can remain airborne indefinitely under most indoor conditions 16 unless there is removal due to air currents or dilution ventilation . This same size range of particles ( ie , < 5 µm ) deposits in the lower respiratory tract in humans 12 , 17 as well as in guinea pigs , mice , and monkeys . 18 Particles sized 6 – 12 µm deposit in the upper airways of the head and neck . 18 Sophisticated imaging studies have shown that plumes of aerosols are generated by sneezing or coughing ( appendix p 1 ) . 19 , 20 The aerosol plume contains the highest concentration of particles , which then dissipate in the air over time and distance . That distance is now much farther than previously appreciated , travelling up to 7 – 8 m . 19 A re - analysis 21 of the size of particles emitted by an average person that would fall to the ground within 2 m is 60 – 100 µm , and these can be carried more than 6 m away by sneezing . Obviously , health - care workers doing procedures close to a patient’s mouth , such as intubations , bronchoscopies , or dental work can easily be exposed to such aerosol plumes . There is a wide range of particle sizes within the plumes . 22 However , the most important questions are whether pathogens are in those plumes and whether their size is consistent with transmission . Studies of cough aerosols and exhaled breath offer answers to those questions . Cough aerosol studies Pathogens have been isolated in the aerosols generated by coughing from patients with various respiratory infections . Studies of those that included methods to measure particle sizes have consistently found pathogens in small particles ( ie , < 5 µm ; table 1 ) .

In the largest study 26 of cough aerosols in tuberculosis , almost half of the patients with drug - resistant - tuberculosis generated cough aerosols , and the highest counts of viable bacilli were in the 2·1 – 4·7 µm size range , consistent with previous studies . 24 , 25 Cystic fibrosis Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been collected from cough aerosols in patients with cystic fibrosis . 27 These patients generated a particle size distribution that was only slightly larger than that noted in patients with tuberculosis ( figure 1 ) . There were relatively few large particles containing bacteria on the settle plates ( median 6 CFU ) or in a wash of the connecting tubing ( 1120 CFU , 95 % CI 200 – 6060 ) . 27 In a follow - up study , the investigators found that viable P aeruginosa from cough aerosols could travel 4 m and remain culturable for up to 45 min . 28 Influenza and other viruses To study the effect of distance , cough aerosols were collected at distances of 1 ft , 3 ft , and 6 ft from 61 patients with influenza ( influenza A or influenza B ) . 31 Particles smaller than 4·7 µm were collected at all three sampling sites . At 6 ft ( 1·83 m ) , hardly any large particles Key messages • Infectious aerosols are particles with potentially pathogenic viruses , bacteria , and fungi suspended in the air , which are subject to the same physical laws as other airborne particulate matter . The biology of the pathogens predicts their airborne survival , infectivity , virulence , and other characteristics . • Particle size is the most important determinant of aerosol behaviour . • Small aerosol particles smaller than 5 µm in aerodynamic size are most likely to remain airborne for indefinite periods ( unless there is removal due to air currents or dilution ventilation ) , and to be deposited in the lower respiratory tract . • Infection control guidelines have stated that most respiratory infections are transmitted by respiratory droplets—ie , particles larger than 5 – 10 µm in size . Airborne transmission has been attributed to only a few pathogens , notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis , via infectious droplet nuclei that are particles sized 5 µm or smaller . The use of airborne infection isolation rooms and respirator masks has been recommended only to protect against airborne transmission . • These recommendations have been based on old data and inferences . Over the past two decades , investigators have collected and directly measured the particle sizes of infectious aerosols emitted from individuals with respiratory infections from aerosols generated by cough and from exhaled breath . • The studies reviewed in this paper consistently show that humans produce infectious aerosols in a wide range of particle sizes , but pathogens predominate in small particles ( < 5 µm that are immediately respirable by exposed individuals . • Data are accumulating that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , the virus that causes COVID - 19 , is transmitted by both small and large particle aerosols . • These data suggest that health - care workers should be protected from these potentially infectious aerosols when working in close proximity to patients . • Some surgical masks might offer respiratory protection compared with not wearing a mask . Filtering facepiece respirators offer more respiratory protection than surgical masks , and powered air purifying respirator ( PAPRs ) hoods offer the best protection for most health - care settings . • Face shields can help decrease exposures to and contamination from large particle aerosols , but they do not offer inhalation protection against small particle aerosols . • PAPRs have built - in eye protection . Surgical masks and other respirators require a face shield or goggles to protect the eyes to prevent infection . • Masking of patients can help to partly reduce infectious aerosol exposures to health - care workers , but are not a substitute for physical distancing and other infection control measures . • Aerosolisation of respiratory pathogens is highly variable , at least partly due to the log - normal distribution of infectious aerosols , consistent with so - called super - spreading . • Airborne infection isolation rooms and other infection control measures against airborne infection are indicated for virulent respiratory pathogens such as SARS - CoV - 2 .

The magnitude of the influenza aerosol output was log - normally distributed , again coherent with super - spreading ( figure 2 ) . In a separate study using a different bioaerosol sampler , 29 viral RNA was detected in cough aerosols in 38 ( 81 % ) of 47 patients with influenza . 35 % of the viral RNA was in particles larger than 4 µm , and 65 % was in particles sized 4 µm or smaller ( figure 2 ) . In children and adults with upper respiratory infections , PCR assays have detected various viruses . 32 During coughing , 82 % of participants produced small particles ( < 4·7 µm ) containing virus , versus 57 % who produced larger particles . Exhaled breath aerosol studies In studies of exhaled breath aerosols with particle size measurements , pathogens were consistently found in small particles ( < 5 µm ; table 2 ) . Other studies assayed exhaled breath condensates or filters , 38 , 48 or used other methods that cannot provide particle size distributions such as direct impaction onto a Petri dish 40 or into liquid media . 36 However , most particles in exhaled breath are smaller than 4 µm , with a median between 0·7 and 1·0 µm . 49 Several virus types have been detected in exhaled breath condensates using PCR , such as influenza , 50 – 52 human rhinovirus , 50 , 52 respiratory syncytial virus , 50 , 52 cytomegalo virus , 53 , 54 Epstein - Barr virus , 53 human papil - loma virus , 55 and Torque teno virus . 56 Bacteria have also been detected by PCR in exhaled breath condensates , especially Haemophilus influenzae , and also P aeruginosa , Escherichia coli , Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , meticillin - sensitive Staphylococcus aureus , and meticillin - resistant S aureus . 57 Viral and bacterial pathogens were isolated from exhaled breath condensates in the same patients , including influenza A , respiratory syncytial virus , S aureus , H influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , and Mycoplasma pneumoniae . 58 Cladosporium , Alternaria , and Penicillium species have been detected in the exhaled breath condensates of patients with asthma . 59 In a study of exposures to patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii colonies , the exhaled breath was positive by PCR in two ( 50 % ) of four critically ill patients and in two ( 22 % ) of nine exposed health - care workers with colonies . 60 Once direct measurement of particles containing viruses in exhaled breath was technically feasible , most particles ( 87 % ) with influenza viral RNA were found to be smaller than 1 µm . 44 Exhaled influenza viral generation rates were estimated to be from fewer than 3·2 to 20 virus particles per min . Further developments enabled detection of so - called fine versus coarse particles ( ie , ≤5 µm vs > 5 µm ) . 45 Influenza viral RNA was detected in the exhaled breath of 34 ( 92 % ) of 37 adults . 45 The fine particles contained 8·8 - times ( 95 % CI 4·1 – 19·0 ) more viral copies than did Pathogen , n / N ( % ) patients Containment method and sampling time Aerosol sampling method Small particle size range ( µm ; % of total aerosol ) Median CFU ( range ) Comment Denver , CO , USA ( Fennelly et al , 2004 ) 23 Mycobacterium tuberculosis , 4 / 16 ( 25 % ) Plexiglass box , 2 × 5 min Two Andersen cascade impactors Most < 4·7 NR ( 3 – 633 ) Development study : all MDR - TB ; no HIV Kampala , Uganda ( Fennelly et al , 2012 ) 24 M tuberculosis , 28 / 101 ( 28 % ) Stainless steel cylinder : 30 L , 2 × 5 min Two Andersen cascade impactors < 4·7 ( 96 % ) 16 ( 1 – 710 ) Feasibility study : 8 ( 8 % ) MDR - TB ; 49 / 84 ( 58 % ) HIV - positive Cape Town , South Africa ( Patterson et al , 2018 ) 25 M tuberculosis , 15 / 35 ( 43 % ) by culture ; 25 / 27 ( 93 % by PCR ) Custom chamber 1400 L Andersen cascade impactor and polycarbonate filter < 4·7 ( 59 % ) 2·5 ( 1 – 14 ) ·· Cape Town , South Africa ( Theron et al , 2020 ) 26 M tuberculosis , 142 / 452 ( 31 % ) 10 L polypropylene chamber ; 5 min One Andersen cascade impactor < 4·7 ( 60 % ) 2 – 4 ( 1 – 310 ) ·· Brisbane , QLD , Australia ( Wainwright et al , 2009 ) 27 Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 25 / 28 ( 89 % ) Stainless steel cylinder : 30 L , 2 × 5 min Andersen cascade impactor < 4·7 ( 72 % ) NR ( 0 – 13 485 ) ·· Brisbane , QLD , Australia ( Knibbs et al , 2014 ) 28 P aeruginosa , 17 / 18 ( 94 % ) at 4 m Stainless steel distance rig One Andersen cascade impactor < 4·7 ( 58 % ) at 4 m Mean 14·3 ( 95 % CI 10·9 – 18·7 ) for small fraction ·· Morgantown , WV , USA ( Lindsley et al , 2010 ) 29 Influenza A , 32 / 38 ( 84 % ) Mechanical spirometer ( 10 L ) NIOSH sampler < 4 ( 65 % ) ·· ·· Morgantown , WV , USA ( Lindsley et al , 2012 ) 30 Influenza , N = 9 Mechanical spirometer with HEPA filtered air Laser particle spectrometer Average count median diameter 0·63 ( SD 0·05 ) Average particles per cough 75 400 ( SD 97 300 ) No viable sampling Winston - Salem , NC , USA ( Bischoff et al , 2013 ) 31 Influenza A and B , 26 / 61 ( 43 % ) Inpatient rooms and emergency department Andersen cascade impactor < 4·7 ( more than 75 % at 1 ft ) ; almost 100 % at 6 ft 5 ( 19 % ) emitted 32 times more than others Sydney , NSW , Australia ( Gralton et al , 2013 ) 32 23 / 28 ( 80 % ) mixed viruses Custom unit Andersen cascade impactor < 4·7 Not measured HRV , RSV , influenza A , and parainfluenza CFU = colony - forming units .

Respiratory viruses have been found in both coughs ( 82 % of participants ) and exhaled breath ( 81 % of participants ) . 32 Similarly , influenza virus was found in similar amounts in coughs ( 53 % of participants ) and breath ( 42 % of participants ) . 36 Human rhinovirus was collected more frequently in exhaled breath than in cough aerosols using a filter method . 38 Findings from two studies with comparable particle size data showed that influenza virus in exhaled breath is contained in smaller particles than influenza virus in cough ( figure 3 ) . 29 , 44 Three studies did not detect M tuberculosis in exhaled breath condensates . 61 – 63 In a study of 16 patients with tuberculosis requiring mechanical ventilation , PCR assays of filters in the expired air were positive in 12 ( 75 % ) . 64 However , two studies 65 , 66 using face - mask sampling from patients with tuberculosis have detected M tuberculosis in exhaled breath . In the first , 65 a N95 respirator with a sampling membrane was worn for 5 min . Patients with tuberculosis were instructed to cough , talk , and breathe normally . M tuberculosis - specific RNA , suggesting viability , was detected in all 15 participants . In a more detailed 24 - h study of 78 patients with tuberculosis , M tuberculosis was detected more frequently in face - mask samples ( 86 % ) than in sputum ( 21 % ) . 66 The most probable mechanism to explain the presence of pathogens in exhaled breath is that the opening of collapsed bronchioles generates aerosols , but there are other theories such as vocal cord closure and vibration . 49 , 67 These mechanisms might explain transmission from asymptomatic individuals . 68 However , there are no data supporting transmission from infectious aerosols in exhaled breath , as most of these studies were focused on diagnostics . Room air and personal sampling studies Infectious aerosols have also been collected from room air , suggesting the potential for exposures to health - care workers . Varicella - zoster virus , known to be one of the most contagious viruses , was detected by PCR in the room air of 64 ( 82 % ) of 78 patients with varicella and in the room air of nine ( 70 % ) of 13 patients with herpes zoster , suggesting airborne transmission . 69 Measles is another very infectious virus . Aerosol sampling was done in the room of a young woman with measles at the head of her bed , and at 0·61 m and 0·91 m away from her head ( 0·91 m = foot of the bed ) . PCR assays were positive for measles RNA in the particles smaller than 4·7 µm collected at all locations ; however , particles larger than 4·7 µm were only positive for virus at the head of the bed . None of the samples were positive by tissue culture . 70 M tuberculosis has been detected in hospital air by PCR from settle plates 71 and filters . 64 , 72 , 73 In an outpatient clinic in South Africa , M tuberculosis was detected by PCR more frequently from personal air samplers worn by health - care workers ( in nine [ 36 % ] of 25 ) than by stationary samplers ( in two [ 8·3 % ] of 24 ) . 74 Influenza virus has been detected using PCR in personal samplers worn by health - care workers and in ambient air samples from an emergency department : 50 % of the airborne virus particles were 4 µm or smaller . 75 Influenza A was also detected by PCR in 19 % of personal samplers and 17 % of stationary samplers in an urgent care clinic . 76 In the same clinic , respiratory syncytial virus RNA was detected in 38 % of the personal samplers and 32 % of the stationary samplers ; 42 % of the particles containing influenza and 9 % of the particles containing respiratory syncytial virus were smaller than 4·1 µm . In a smaller study , 77 influenza A viral RNA was detected in five ( 50 % ) of ten sample collections . Most ( four of five ) were from particles larger than 4 µm , and one was from particles sized 1 – 4 µm . In another study , 78 six ( 37·5 % ) of 16 air samples near patients with influenza were positive by PCR in all particle size ranges tested—ie , smaller than 1 µm , 1 – 4 µm , and larger than 4 µm . In a large study 79 in a busy inner - city emergency department , influenza was detected in 53 ( 42 % ) of 125 personal samplers worn by 30 health - care workers , in 28 ( 43 % ) of 96 room air samples , in 23 ( 76 % ) of 30 surface samples , and on three ( 25 % ) of 12 respirators worn while exposed to a patient with confirmed influenza . In a separate study at a large hospital in China , 80 influenza was detected in 15 ( 79 % ) of 19 air samples in all particle size ranges ( < 1 µm , 1 – 4 µm , and > 4 µm ) . Total influenza virus ranged from 3715 to 119 371 copies per m³ .

In Toronto , air sampling with a slit sampler yielded two of ten samples that were positive for SARS - CoV by PCR but negative on viral culture . Both PCR and cultures were negative on 28 filter samples . 93 Retrospective analyses strongly suggested that airborne transmission probably occurred in Hong Kong . 94 – 96 The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) coronavirus was isolated from seven room air samples from dedicated MERS units in two South Korean hospitals . All seven were positive by PCR and four of seven were positive on viral culture . 97 Infectious aerosols of SARS CoV - 2 Since the outbreak of COVID - 19 , there has been a question over airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . Similar to that seen with SARS - CoV , there was only a mild reduction in viability over a 3 - h period in an experimental aerosol generated in a laboratory , consistent with a potential for airborne spread . 98 To date , there are no published reports of cough aerosol or exhaled breath sampling from patients with COVID - 19 , but SARS - CoV - 2 has been detected in the air of hospitals in China 99 and the USA . 100 The virus was detected in both surface and air samples in another hospital in Wuhan , China , with positive PCR tests on 14 ( 35 % ) of 40 air samples from the intensive care unit and two ( 12·5 % ) of 16 air samples from the general ward . 101 It appears that SARS - CoV - 2 has the potential to be spread by all modes of transmission : direct contact ( ie , person - to - person ) and indirect contact ( eg , via contaminated objects and aerosol ) . 100 It is not yet clear which mode occurs most frequently .

There is no evidence to support the concept that most respiratory infections are associated with primarily large droplet transmission . In fact , small particle aerosols are the rule , rather than the exception , contrary to current guidelines . 12 These small particles occur without a need for a prolonged time to allow for desiccation , and they are of a size that is immediately respirable . These data also add evidence that could update the current dichotomous infection control guidelines , as was proposed 9 years ago . 110 The logic that transmission within close proximity defines respiratory droplet spread is fallacious , as small particle aerosols are in the highest concentration close to patients and dissipate with distance . There is epidemio - logical evidence of an increased risk of tuberculosis transmission within close proximity . 111 – 113 Individuals sharing a bed with a source patient with tuberculosis are more likely to be infected than people sharing the same room ; in turn , people sharing the same room as the source case have a higher risk than individuals in a different room . 114 – 116 An outbreak associated with an aerosol - generating device used to clean a tuberculous abscess revealed a gradient of tuberculin reactivity , with higher rates among patients in rooms closest to the source case’s room . 117 Physical distancing decreases transmission potential from pathogens in small particles as well as in large particles , although small particles have a greater capacity to travel further . The variability of transmission among respiratory pathogens appears to be less dependent on the physical particle size emitted by the diseased person , as current guidelines suggest , but more by biological factors such as the size of the emitted inoculum , the ability of the pathogen to survive desiccation and other stresses of aerosolisation and airborne transport , and environmental factors such as air movement , temperature and humidity , and host defences . Implications of infectious aerosol data for infection control practice Because of the large number of patients in health - care settings , health - care workers are likely to have frequent exposures to highly infectious cases . They might also have more cumulative inhaled doses and infections , although it is unknown if this is involved in the pathogenesis of COVID - 19 . Infection control measures might not only reduce the probability of infection , but might also reduce the size of the inhaled inocu - lum , which has been associated with disease severity in influenza 118 , 119 and other diseases . 120 This might be especially important for small particle aerosols , as 1 µm aerosols of Bacillus anthracis caused higher mortality in animals than 12 µm aerosols in a seminal study . 121 Masks versus respirators Modelling studies 122 – 124 and simulated workplace protection studies 125 – 127 in the USA have shown benefits of various types of respirators and little to no protection from surgical masks . A study in the UK found that surgical masks could reduce inert aerosol exposure by two times , but filtering facepiece respirators reduced the exposure by a factor of 100 or higher . 128 In a study of influenza aerosols , surgical masks reduced exposure by an average of six times , but there was a wide range of reduction from 1·1 to 55 times , depending on the design of the mask . 129 Two randomised trials 130 , 131 did not show any benefit of N95 respirators over surgical masks in reducing respiratory illnesses , and two showed that the respirators were protective . 132 , 133 However , none of the trials used quantitative fit testing , and two had surprisingly low failure rates ( 1·1 – 2·6 % ) 132 , 133 compared with 60 % found in a panel study for the same N95 respirators . 134 The low failure rates suggest a problem with fit testing . Filtering facepiece respirators are only as effective as their fit , as the weak point of these respirators is the face - mask leak . 135 , 136 Unfortunately , there has been little operational research on the process of fit - testing respir - ators for health - care workers . There is wide variability among filtering facepiece respirators , and “it may be of more benefit…to wear a respirator model with good - fitting characteristics without fit testing than to wear a respirator model with poor - fitting characteristics after passing a fit - test . ” 134 Similarly , there are some surgical masks that offer good protection , but as they are not certified or regulated as devices for respiratory protection , it is difficult to know which is the best to use . There is a pressing need for research in this area . Face shields can decrease inhalation exposures to wearers and surface contamination of filtering facepiece respirators by aerosol particles of a median diameter of 8·5 µm by 96 % and 97 % , respectively , but they only reduce inhalation exposures to smaller particle aerosols of 3·4 µm by 23 % . 137 Masks to prevent transmission from the wearer Although surgical masks offer little protection from inhaled agents , they have a role in protecting health - care workers when worn by patients . Placing surgical masks on patients with multidrug - resistant tuberculosis Viewpoint 8 www . thelancet . com / respiratory Published online July 24 , 2020 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / S2213 - 2600 ( 20 ) 30323 - 4 decreased transmission to guinea pigs by 56 % , 138 and masking of patients with cystic fibrosis reduced P aeruginosa air contamination by 8 % . 139 Surgical masks reduced the quantity of influenza viral RNA by 2·8 times in small particles and by 25 times in large ones . 45 More recently , surgical masks effectively reduced large droplets ( > 5 µm ) of seasonal coronaviruses from three of ten patients to 0 of 11 ( p = 0·09 ) and small aerosols ( < 5 µm ) from four of ten patients to 0 of 11 ( p = 0·04 ) . 47 Similarly , surgical masks reduced droplets of influenza from six of 23 to one of 27 ( p = 0·04 ) . However , the reduction in influenza small aerosols ( < 5 µm ) was not significant . There is mounting evidence suggesting that the wearing of masks can reduce transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in community and health - care settings . 140 A major limitation to much of the data on infectious aerosols of viruses is the reliance on PCR findings ; few studies have evaluated viability using cell cultures or other methods . Viability itself can be difficult to assess . Aerosolisation from the respiratory tract produces multiple stresses on microbes that can decrease their viability , usually defined by the ability to be cultured . Indoors , desiccation predominates , but temperature , radiation , oxygen , ozone and its reaction products , and other exposures can also damage viral lipids , proteins , and nucleic acids . 141 Aerosol sampling itself can produce additional stresses , including mechanical trauma , add - itional desiccation , and injury in post - sampling pro - cesses and extraction . 142 PCR assays are usually easier to do logistically than using cell cultures for viral sampling . For example , our group was able to directly sample influenza virus onto monolayers of cell cultures in the laboratory , but this proved impractical for transport to and from clinical sites because of the sensitivity of the cells to spillage and pH stresses . 143 These multiple factors , as well as inherent physical inefficiencies of air samplers , suggest that most infectious aerosol data are probably underestimates of the exposures to health - care workers . Obviously , infectious individuals breathe continuously 24 h per day , but there are no data on possible circadian rhythms or variability in output . By contrast , coughing can be very paroxysmal and sporadic . Although 24 - h cough frequency can be measured , it has not been linked to aerosol production . There is only one study of the association between cough aerosol production by tuberculosis index cases and new infections in exposed contacts ; 34 however , no studies have documented trans - mission of any respiratory infections exclusively via large respiratory droplets or fomites . Although the data reviewed here indicate that there are small proportions of patients who are highly infectious and probably super - spreaders , 42 , 43 until a diagnostic test or other method is available to identify them , we must consider all patients with respiratory pathogens as potentially infectious . Discussion This Viewpoint suggests that infection control guidelines should be re - evaluated to account for the predominance of small particles within infectious aerosols . Protective devices available to health - care workers have a range of protection , increasing from surgical masks to filtering facepiece respirators to powered air - purifying respirators . Although these are indicated for close encounters , their limitations highlight the need for improved admini strative controls , such as more rapid diagnosis and isolation , and the development of vaccines and treatments . These data support calls for the recognition of aerosol ( ie , traditional airborne ) transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . 144 This could facilitate the use of enhanced dilution and directional ventilation and other environ mental control options—eg , air disinfection with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation , 145 which might be especially helpful in congregate settings such as nursing homes . Implementation of improved infection control measures could prevent future morbidity and mortality among health - care workers .
