October 2022 | ergonomics in design 29 PURPOSE AND POTENTIAL This article is Part 2 of a two - part series that addresses the pursuit of authentic diver - sity within the Human Factors and Ergo - nomics Society ( HFES ) , and how this work is essential to realizing its overarching goals ( HFES , n . d . - c ) . Part 1 began by articulating an informal framework for authentic diver - sity that defined the overall concept , differ - ent types of diversity , discussed benefits of authentic diversity , and considered factors that may support , threaten , or influence authentic diversity . In brief , authentic diversity refers to representation of different people and ideas that is accompanied by legitimate feelings and experiences of belonging , worth , and participation . The people who are present must also have power , value , and agency within the organization . Collectively , this authentic experience of being a valued part of the organization is referred to as inclusion ( Puritty et al . , 2017 ; Roberson , 2006 ; Sherbin & Rashid , 2017 ; Shore et al . , 2011 ; Tienda , 2013 ) . Moreover , authentic diversity further requires attention to equity , or working to ensure that peoples’ different needs and resources are not barriers to inclusion . Part 1 also addressed HFES demographics – as a relatively simple metric of authentic diversity – and reported disparities with respect to gender , race , and ethnicity . Beyond this simple metric , HFES has also demonstrated its commitment to authentic diversity through a variety of activities in recent years . Part 2 now addresses a brief history of relevant efforts in the HFES community , alongside recent scholarship in human factors and ergonomics ( HF / E ) , suggesting sustained interest in diversity issues . Following these assessments of authentic diversity , the article reflects on how HFES might continue to pursue authentic diversity . Efforts Supporting Authentic Diversity in HFES HFES has documented its progress in gender parity via a series of profiles on its first woman member ( Ruth Hoyt in 1958 ) , Fellow ( Dora Dougherty McKeown in 1968 ) , President ( Gloria L . Grace in 1978 ) , and Editor - in - Chief ( Nancy J . Cooke in 2005 ; see Durso , 2014 ) . Other efforts to address diver - sity within HFES include the establishment of the first HFES Diversity Task Force in 1994 . The Diversity Task Force was renewed yearly until 2015 – 2016 , when diversity and inclusion were officially added to the HFES Strategic Plan and the Diversity Task Force transitioned to a more permanent standing committee by then HFES President William S . Marras . The inaugural Diversity Commit - tee , led by Pascale Carayon , formed a charter to support diversity and inclusion efforts within the society . . . by continuing and initi - ating programming or policies . . . [ that ] foster a culture and atmosphere of mutual respect , to retain , attract , and promote outstanding , diverse human factors professionals . ( Chiou et al . , 2017 , p . 498 ) The Diversity Committee was recognized as a Council Committee in 2019 , the highest level in the committee hierarchy ( Chiou et al . , 2017 ; HFES , n . d . - b ) . In recent years , HFES annual meeting programming has consistently included topics on diversity and inclusion within HFES and the fields of HF / E . A search f e a t u r e FEATURE AT A GLANCE : This article is Part 2 of a two - part series reflecting on diversity within the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society ( HFES ) . Part 1 discussed what it means to pursue authentic diversity and reported recent demographic characteristics of HFES . Part 2 discusses a brief history of relevant efforts in HFES and recent scholarship that suggests sustained interest in diversity issues within human factors and ergonomics . Part 2 concludes with a discussion about how human factors and ergonomics professionals can continue to lead the design and implemen - tation of systemic change that benefits all by embracing human complexity .

Chiou & Rod D . Roscoe 30 ergonomics in d esign | October 2022 f e a t u r e | Assessing Authentic Diversity in the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society : Part 2 conducted on the HFES annual meeting programs from 2016 to 2019 identified items summarized in Table 1 . This list represents an incomplete selection of activities because it only considers what was documented through print ( HFES , 2016 , 2017 , 2018 , 2019 ) . However , these activities suggest an increasing awareness of , or sustained interest in , diversity and inclusion as part of HFES and HF / E culture and practice . Interest in diversity and inclusion is also demonstrated in the emergence of several “affinity groups , ” including the HFES Women’s Group , LGBTQ ( lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer or questioning ) Affinity Group , and People of Color Affinity Group ( HFES , n . d . - b ) . These affinity groups were either formed “bottom up” by members ( e . g . , Women’s Group activities go back to 2013 ; E . Blickensderfer , personal commu - nication , August 24 , 2020 ) , or formed “top down” by HFES leadership . In all cases , these groups were formed to support and represent the needs of those who identify as members of those groups or as active allies of those groups . A Leadership Development Committee was also established in 2018 by HFES President Kermit Davis to work toward making leadership roles in HFES more accessible to a diverse set of future leaders . This list of activities is not exhaustive , but collectively these contribute toward HFES’s authentic diversity in several ways . First , the proliferation of annual meeting panels and affinity groups provides a means of expressing observations , concerns , needs , and goals to be heard by HFES colleagues and leaders . Second , these activities provide a way for people – especially those from underrepresented groups – to gather , socialize , and be recognized . These activities increase the visibility of shared concerns and interests for current and prospective members . This visibility also helps form a foothold for representational diversity ( e . g . , the presence of diverse role models ) , as well as feelings of value , belonging , and power . Third , these activities communicate that HFES values diverse people and concerns . HFES already comprises numer - ous Technical Groups ( TGs ) that represent a wealth of exper - tise ( i . e . , functional and cognitive diversity ) . However , affinity groups and annual meeting events demonstrate growing attention to demographic or cultural diversity as well . Impor - tantly , both annual meeting events and affinity groups can only occur after review ( e . g . , peer review of panel submissions or Executive Council review of proposed affinity groups ) . That these activities occur with official sanction and approval by the HFES further demonstrates interest and commitment . Recent Scholarship Relevant to Authentic Diversity As suggested by several aforementioned activities ( e . g . , Wooldridge et al . , 2018 ) , efforts to be a more inclusive com - munity have paralleled attention to diversity , equity , and inclusion in research and practice .

October 2022 | ergonomics in design 3 1 f e a t u r e | Assessing Authentic Diversity in the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society : Part 2 themes from various TGs . These publications represent a small selection from the past several decades of proceedings papers ( e . g . , Carayon et al . , 2002 ; Newman , 2002 ; Perchonok & Montague , 2012 ; Sanders et al . , 2006 ; Smith et al . , 1994 ) . Across this body of work , there are generally three approaches to addressing diversity issues : addressing or discovering group disparities , demonstrating inclusive design or research practices , or demonstrating an intervention with societal impact . Notably , the selection from 2016 to 2019 covers diverse domains spanning product design , urban development , workforce development , education , and health care . This ongoing scholarly interest in diversity , equity , and inclusion reflects shifts in the HF / E profession since its World War II origins . The earliest HF / E work was much more isolated from studying or designing for intergroup differences ( Kuorinka , 2000 ; Lillie , 1950 ; Stuster , 2006 ; Taylor , 1993 ) . This may be why a selection of annual meeting papers from 2016 to 2019 still represent a small minority compared with other technical topics , and why related work published outside of HFES can be found ( e . g . , Gatehouse et al . , 2018 ; Hardy & Vargas , 2019 ; Harrington et al . , 2019 ; O’Leary et al . , 2019 ; Spiel et al . , 2018 ) . Given that published papers tend to represent a fraction of total submissions , it is reasonable to infer that others have tried to submit work related to diversity , equity , and inclusion but were not successful due to biases about what issues or populations HF / E addresses . However , published work ultimately shows that addressing these issues is an active area of interest for HFES . In compari - son with early years , the field of HF / E seems to have evolved to include broader representation and advocacy for vulnerable groups working or living within oppressive systems . Recog - nizing that diversity , equity , and inclusion are areas that HF / E can help address through publications and presentations contributes to authentic diversity . This recognition may demonstrate to students and to prospective HFES members how to productively engage as scholar - activists – that career success and community impact can go hand - in - hand . Much more could be written about how HF / E tools and methods could contribute to diversity , equity , and inclusion related efforts . Indeed , there is a longer history of related work that is not reviewed here ( e . g . , Moray , 1993 ; Roscoe et al . , 2020 ; Smith - Jackson et al . , 2013 ; Stephanidis , 1995 ; Ward , 1989 ) .

TG = Technical Group . 32 ergonomics in d esign | October 2022 f e a t u r e | Assessing Authentic Diversity in the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society : Part 2 However , the primary focus of this paper series is intentionally self - reflective . This self - reflection addresses whether the public , outward scholarship and advocacy of HF / E matches the internal stewardship and practices of HFES as assessed through its demographics in Part 1 , and through its networking activities and scholarship in this article , Part 2 . Indeed , assessing whether internal values match external functions is another hallmark of an organization’s authentic diversity . Overall , HFES appears to be on a positive trajectory regarding authentic diversity . This progress is suggested by recent organizational efforts to promote and to establish support for minority groups , and by recent annual meeting programming by individual members . Efforts that embrace authentic diversity – if they are sustained , well - supported , and mindfully implemented – should spur further growth of the society , as well as diversity of its growth in the long run ( Bourke & Dillon , 2018 ; Cedric , 2009 ; Nemeth , 1986 ; Sherbin & Rashid , 2017 ; van Knippenberg & Schippers , 2007 ) . DISCUSSION The framework for authentic diversity described in Part 1 provides structure for assessing HFES’s diversity health . Demographics , notable milestones ( e . g . , the “first women” ) , and activities ( e . g . , panels ) can be interpreted within this framework . The formation of the Diversity Committee and affinity groups are examples of organizational support that serve as both antecedents and indicators of authentic diversity . However , on their own , they may be insufficient . Further - more , publishing on topics that relate to diversity , inclusion , and equity shows intellectual interest and professional com - mitment to these topics , but does not necessarily mean that HFES is a diverse or inclusive group , as shown in Part 1 . HFES must recognize and internalize diversity , equity , and inclusion as fundamental values that guide the organization ( e . g . , operations , policies , recruitment , events , and outreach ) and the work of its members ( e . g . , research , practice , and service ) . Systemic change will require committed work at multiple levels and by multiple stakeholders – not just among special interest groups . This work includes understanding the following : 1 . To what extent HFES is an inclusive environment 2 . What HFES can do to be more inclusive as an organization 3 . How to do work on inclusion , or studying inclusion and equity as HF / E topics 4 . How to be inclusive as we work , in our work groups and in our methods Part 2 documented steps taken by individual leaders and members in each of these areas over the past several decades – but has this progress been enough ? An essential question that extends from this self - reflection is whether and how the HF / E profession defines and accepts societal problems – ineq - uities and injustice – as problems it can help address . Where does HF / E have the responsibility and capacity for problem - solving ? What motivates these questions is for HFES to have greater and more lasting impact on issues that some may describe as beyond its traditional focus . Self - assessments of HFES diversity to - date have focused primarily on demographic diversity . As an example of this , a revised set of demographics questions developed by the Diversity Committee was implemented on the new HFES website in the fall of 2020 . However , HFES’s instruments for assessing authentic diversity – including this paper series – are still very new , optional , and possibly lacking in some catego - ries . More important , these tools lack a standardized reporting process , and lack integration with day - to - day operations . HFES has implemented diversity as a strategic goal , but HFES is not currently systematically measuring progress toward this goal . Regarding recent activities and efforts ( e . g . , new Affinity Groups ) , HFES does not have any formal procedures for archiving , knowledge sharing , or transitioning efforts between task forces or committees . This means that successful transi - tions between parts of the organization currently rely on the goodwill or organizational skillset of individual volunteers . Although committees and task forces are expected to provide annual or semiannual updates to the Executive Council , it is unclear if and how these reports are stored , shared , or accessed . Except for a published proceedings paper ( Smith - Jackson et al . , 2016 ) , the 2014 Task Force survey results , and 2016 Diversity Committee Report ( Carayon , 2016 ) , only two additional Diversity Task Force reports from 1999 to 2000 were tracked down by the first author after searching for contact information and reaching out to all former Diversity Task Force Chairs ( HFES , n . d . - a ) . Without formalized tracking , archiving , and sharing of data and organizational knowledge , such metrics of HFES’s progress on diversity will be inaccessible to future generations . If future members do not have access to previous ideas , efforts , failures , and achievements , this severely limits the organization’s ability to learn , to celebrate milestones , and to progress . Just as this paper series – and its incomplete reporting – relied on historical documents compiled by individual members or leaders who served the Society ( Carayon , 2016 ; Durso , 2014 ; Smith - Jackson et al . , 2016 ; Stuster , 2006 ) , future members and leaders would benefit from having more systematic organizational knowledge transfer . This would allow for the tracking of efforts between cycles or generations of leadership , so that important lessons and achievements are not overlooked . FUTURE DIRECTION The potential for HFES to grow as a professional home for others , and the potential for HF / E to grow as a profession with societal impact , motivates this paper series . Research on inno - vation and economic productivity shows that social inequities involving groups that were historically targets of discrimina - tion and violence , hurts not only the members of those groups October 2022 | ergonomics in design 33 f e a t u r e | Assessing Authentic Diversity in the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society : Part 2 but also the broader population’s productivity and progress for generations ( Cook , 2014 , 2020 ) . Research also shows that defaults are powerful in guiding personal decisions , defaults like working within one’s own existing networks rather than reaching out to someone different or new , and such decisions can have consequential , population - level effects ( Johnson & Goldstein , 2003 ; Schelling , 1973 ) . HF / E as a field recognizes that systemic change requires a sociotechnical systems perspective and working across multiple levels of a system . Within HFES , these levels may look like its members , chapters , leadership , and global network . Importantly , HFES leaders , administrators , and members must internalize authentic diversity as a fundamental value of their work ( including in research , education , practice , and service ) . However , systemic change ultimately requires better measure - ment , tracking , and understanding of the extent that HFES is an authentically diverse organization . Some questions remain about HFES’s future that requires additional dialogue and actions within the HFES . For exam - ple , should a goal for diversity in HFES be to mirror the demographic composition of society ? Whatever the case , adopting a more inclusive approach allows HF / E professionals to leverage their substantial expertise , often involving an appreciation for human complexity , to develop better under - standing and more effective interventions that benefit the people within a system . Embracing this complexity , rather than rejecting it , may benefit vulnerable and disadvantaged groups the most – but in fact it benefits everyone . CONCLUSION In HFES’s “first 50 years” in review , an early contributor fondly recalled the days in which the membership of about 15 people “enjoyed monthly dinner sessions and were happy to not have bylaws , officers , or dues” ( Van Cott , 2006 ) . Creating such intimate and inclusive environments is undoubtedly critical for early career development and can result in the type of meaning - ful connections that propel a society forward for 63 years and counting , with 3 , 500 or more members . Indeed , HFES was known for its inclusivity early on in its history . As the American Psychological Association Division 21 , founded in 1956 , wrote , The Human Factors Society was from the very beginning a multi - disciplinary organization that accepted as members anyone who worked or even expressed interest in any of the multiple areas of human factors - area . . . . Although at its beginning between a third and a half of its members were psychologists , the Human Factors Society has never been viewed as a “psychological society , ” nor has it indicated any desire to be so perceived . ( Alluisi , 1993 , p . 17 ) Yet creating inclusive environments for all can be challenging to manage as organizations grow , especially without mindful and shared responsibility . The question for such organizations is whether or not this continued growth of the membership , and of the profession , is a goal . REFERENCES Alluisi , E . A . ( 1993 ) .
