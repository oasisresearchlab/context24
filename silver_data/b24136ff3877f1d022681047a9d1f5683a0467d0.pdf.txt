Contrary to the idea that a - catenin links the adhesion protein E - cadherin through b - catenin to the actin cy - toskeleton , in the accompanying paper we report that a - catenin does not bind simulta - neously to both E - cadherin - b - catenin and actin ﬁlaments . Here we demonstrate that a - catenin exists as a monomer or a homo - dimer with different binding properties . Mo - nomeric a - catenin binds more strongly to E - cadherin - b - catenin , whereas the dimer preferentially binds actin ﬁlaments . Differ - ent molecular conformations are associ - ated with these different binding states , in - dicating that a - catenin is an allosteric protein . Signiﬁcantly , a - catenin directly re - gulates actin - ﬁlament organization by sup - pressing Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymeri - zation , likely by competing with the Arp2 / 3 complex for binding to actin ﬁlaments . These results indicate a new role for a - cate - nin in local regulation of actin assembly and organization at sites of cadherin - mediated cell - cell adhesion . INTRODUCTION Epithelial cell - cell junctions are organized by adhesion pro - teins and the underlying actin cytoskeleton . They provide adaptable interfaces that can respond to signals for cell movement during convergent extension in gastrulation ( Keller , 2002 ) or changes in cell shape during tube formation ( Lubarsky and Krasnow , 2002 ) but also provide a constant permeability barrier between different biological compart - ments in the body . Analysis of how migrating cells initiate cell - cell adhesion has revealed dramatic changes in mem - brane dynamics and organization of the actin cytoskeleton . Migrating cellshavecharacteristic forward - moving lamellipo - dia produced by rapid Arp2 / 3 - nucleated assembly of a branched actin network perpendicular to the leading edge ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Upon cell - cell adhesion , la - mellipodial activity is reduced over the contacting area , and there is a concomitant reorganization of actin ﬁlaments ( Adams et al . , 1998 ; Ehrlich et al . , 2002 ; Omelchenko et al . , 2001 ; Vaezi et al . , 2002 ; Vasioukhin et al . , 2001 ) ; electron microscopy of simple epithelial cells indicates the formation of bundles of actin ﬁlaments parallel to the contacting mem - branes ( Hirokawa et al . , 1983 ) , an organization very different from that of branched actin in lamellipodia . It is unknown how engagement of cadherins between migrating cells causes these dramatic changes in actin - ﬁlament assembly and or - ganization . The intracellular domain of cadherins binds cytoplasmic proteins that are thought to recruit and organize actin ﬁla - ments ( Gumbiner , 2000 ; Jamora and Fuchs , 2002 ) . These molecular linkages ( Nagafuchi and Takeichi , 1988 ; Ozawa et al . , 1989 ) include high - afﬁnity binding of b - catenin to the cadherin cytoplasmic domain ( Huber et al . , 2001 ) and a lower - afﬁnity interaction between b - catenin and a - catenin ( Pokutta and Weis , 2000 ) . Since a - catenin can also bind actin ﬁlaments in vitro ( Pokutta et al . , 2002 ; Rimm et al . , 1995 ) , it is widely accepted that a - catenin bound to the cadherin - b - catenin complex bridges these components to actin . In addition , many actin binding proteins have been reported to bind a - catenin , including vinculin and a - actinin ( Kobielak and Fuchs , 2004 ) , suggesting that they could also link the cadherin - catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton . Furthermore , the Rho family of small GTPases ( Braga , 2002 ; Fukata and Kaibuchi , 2001 ) and the actin nucleators formin ( Kobielak et al . , 2004 ) and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Kovacs et al . , 2002 ) are involved in Cell 123 , 903 – 915 , December 2 , 2005 ª 2005 Elsevier Inc . 903 cell - cell adhesion and may regulate actin dynamics around the cadherin - catenin complex . In the accompanying paper ( Yamada et al . , 2005 [ this issue of Cell ] ) , experiments with puriﬁed proteins demon - strated that the ternary complex of cadherin - b - catenin - a - catenin does not bind directly to actin ﬁlaments or indirectly through vinculin or a - actinin . Moreover , live - cell imaging showed that the cadherin - catenin complex has dynamics that are very different from those of actin , consistent with the lack of a stable linkage between the cadherin - catenin complex and actin in cells . The inability of a - catenin to bind simultaneously to the cadherin - b - catenin complex and actin indicates that it may function as a molecular switch , whereby binding to one part - ner changes the ability to interact with the other . Here we provide evidence that these changes are associated with distinct conformational states of a - catenin and that dimer - ization of a - catenin inﬂuences its ability to selectively bind to b - catenin or actin . Given the highly dynamic properties of the actin network at cell - cell contacts , we further exam - ined the role of a - catenin in regulating actin assembly . We show that a - catenin suppresses actin polymerization by the Arp2 / 3 complex , suggesting that assembly and cluster - ing of the cadherin - catenin complex at cell - cell contacts may provide a pool of a - catenin that can locally regulate actin dy - namics and organization . RESULTS Native and Recombinant a - Catenin Exist as Monomer and Homodimer Puriﬁed a - catenin has been reported to be a homodimer in solution ( Koslov et al . , 1997 ) . The crystal structure of the N - terminal domain of a - catenin revealed that the dimeriza - tion domain overlaps the b - catenin binding domain ( Pokutta and Weis , 2000 ) . Since the stoichiometry of the a - catenin - b - catenin heterodimer is 1 : 1 , the a - catenin homodimer would have to dissociate before a - catenin could bind b - catenin ( Pokutta and Weis , 2000 ) . Thus , the molecular state of a - catenin ( monomer , homodimer , heterodimer with b - catenin ) appears to be critical for interactions with potential binding partners . A pool of a - catenin is found in MDCK cell cytoplasm , and another is associated with the E - cadherin - b - catenin com - plex at the plasma membrane ( Hinck et al . , 1994 ) . Fraction - ation of a 100 , 000 (cid:1) g cytosol supernatant by gel ﬁltration re - vealed two peaks of a - catenin ( Figure 1A ) with elution volumes similar to those of puriﬁed recombinant His - tagged a - catenin ( Figure 1B ) . The molecular mass of the two peaks of His - tagged a - catenin , determined by multiangle light scat - tering ( MALS ) , corresponded to an a - catenin monomer and homodimer , respectively ( Figure 1B ) . Data from several inde - pendent experiments indicated that 60 % – 75 % of cytosolic a - catenin in MDCK cells was monomeric ( Figure 1A ) , and the proportion of monomer was independent of the cell plat - ing density ( data not shown ) . Although the ﬁrst peak of a - catenin observed in the cyto - sol fractionation can be superimposed on the elution proﬁle of the recombinant a - catenin homodimer , we found that en - dogenous b - catenin also coeluted with this peak . Since re - combinant b - catenin elutes at a smaller apparent molecular weight ( e . g . , Figures 2A and 2B ) , the observed coelution of b - catenin and a - catenin may indicate that there is a b - / a - catenin heterodimer in MDCK cell cytosol . Indeed , a - catenin coimmunoprecipitated with b - catenin from the higher - molecular - weight peak ( Figure 1C ) . However , a b - / a - catenin heterodimer does not account for all a - catenin in this peak , as endogenous a - catenin can be coimmunoprecipitated with a green ﬂuorescent protein - a - catenin fusion protein ( GFP - a - catenin ) , indicating the presence of a - catenin homo - dimer in cytosol ( Figure 1C ) . Comparison of the amount of a - catenin in the pellet and supernatant after coimmunoprecipi - tation with b - catenin indicates that approximately 20 % of a - catenin inthe higher - molecular - weight fraction wasbound to b - catenin , withapproximately80 % an a - cateninhomodimer . Thus , in contrast to previous reports , puriﬁed a - catenin can exist as a monomer and homodimer in solution , and most ofendogenous a - catenininMDCKcellcytosolismonomeric . The concentration of a - catenin in the MDCK cell cytosol was estimated from a - catenin Western blots by comparing the intensities of bands from cytosol to those from known amounts of input recombinant a - catenin . The most intense monomer fractions had a concentration of 7 nM . Accounting for cell volume and dilution during cell lysis and column chro - matography , we obtain an estimate of 0 . 6 m M a - catenin in cytosol . Recombinant a - catenin appears as a mixture of monomer and dimer when run on gel ﬁltration columns at concentrations of 2 – 20 m M ( e . g . , Figure 1B ) . This places the homodimerization constant in the micromolar range , which is consistent with the observation that the majority of cytosolic a - catenin is monomeric . a - Catenin Monomer and Homodimer Show Preferential Binding to b - Catenin and Actin , Respectively Since a - catenin forms a 1 : 1 complex with b - catenin and the homodimerization and b - catenin binding domains of a - catenin overlap ( Pokutta and Weis , 2000 ) , we hypothe - sized that a - catenin monomer should bind more readily to b - catenin . Formation of the b - catenin - a - catenin complex was monitored in solution by gel ﬁltration chromatography . Mixtures of a - catenin and b - catenin were applied to an ana - lytical gel ﬁltration column at 26 m M , which then became di - luted approximately 10 - fold on the column . Under these conditions , a - catenin homodimer did not bind b - catenin , and both proteins eluted separately ( Figure 2A ) , whereas the majority of a - catenin monomer eluted in a 1 : 1 complex with b - catenin ( Figure 2B ) . We assessed whether the pres - ence of E - cadherin affects the relative afﬁnities of a - catenin monomer or homodimer for b - catenin . Pull - down assays wereestablishedusingglutathione - agarosebeadstocapture bacterially expressed GST - E - cadherin cytoplasmic domain ( GST - E cyto ) , full - length recombinant b - catenin , and increas - ing amounts of full - length His - tagged a - catenin monomer or homodimer ; note that recombinant GST - E cyto and b - catenin bind with 36 nM afﬁnity in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry in solution 904 Cell 123 , 903 – 915 , December 2 , 2005 ª 2005 Elsevier Inc . ( Huber et al . , 2001 ; Choi et al . , 2006 ) . The resulting bead bound complexes showed that the a - catenin monomer has a higher apparent afﬁnity for b - catenin than the homodimer ( saturationreachedatapproximately20 m Mmonomerversus 50 m M for the homodimer ) ( Figure 2C ) . Gel ﬁltration and pull - down assays using plakoglobin , a homolog of b - catenin that also binds E - cadherin and a - catenin , gave similar results ( see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online ) . We tested whether a - catenin monomer and homodimer have different apparent afﬁnities for actin ﬁlaments in an in vitro actin pelleting assay . Greater than 90 % of the a - catenin homodimer pelleted with actin ﬁlaments , whereas less than 40 % of the monomer bound ( Figure 2D ) . As a frac - tion of puriﬁed a - catenin monomer rapidly converts to the homodimer ( see above ) , it is impossible to obtain samples thatare100 % puremonomeric a - catenin . Therefore , itispos - sible that the a - catenin bound to actin ﬁlaments in this exper - imentisduetocontaminatinghomodimerandthatthemono - mer does not bind actin ﬁlaments under these conditions . In the accompanying paper ( Yamada et al . , 2005 ) , we showed that binding of a - catenin to b - catenin and actin is mutually exclusive . This was conﬁrmed by using the chimeric b - catenin - a - catenin protein , which mimics the interaction of the two proteins by covalently linking the a - catenin binding site of b - catenin to the b - catenin binding domain of a - catenin ( Pokutta and Weis , 2000 ) . Gel ﬁltration chroma - tography ( data not shown ) and MALS ( Figure 1D ) demon - strated that the b - catenin - a - catenin chimera is monomeric . Therefore , theinabilityofthechimeratobindtoactincouldbe Figure 1 . Oligomeric State of a - Catenin ( A ) Superdex 200 gel ﬁltration chromatography of MDCK cell cytosol .

Alternatively , binding of b - catenin induces a conformation of a - catenin that is unable to bind actin . The inability of a - catenin to bind both b - catenin and actin simultaneously suggests that the N - and C - terminal domains of a - catenin are allosterically coupled , whereby binding to one partner alters its ability to bind to the other . Interestingly , the homologous protein vinculin shows the opposite behav - ior : the head and tail regions of vinculin bind to talin and actin , respectively , only if an autoinhibitory head - tail interaction is relieved ( Bass et al . , 2002 ; Johnson and Craig , 1995 ) . Puri - ﬁed vinculin behaves as a globular protein on a sizing col - umn , whereas monomeric a - catenin displays a considerably larger apparent molecular mass ( Figure 3A ) , indicating a more extended , open conformation . Moreover , we could not detect an interaction between the N - and C - terminal do - mains of a - catenin ( S . P . , unpublished data ) . The ba - catenin chimera has a gel ﬁltration elution proﬁle similar to that of mo - nomeric a - catenin , implying that its inability to bind to actin is not due to an interaction between a - catenin N - and C - termi - nal domains . Furthermore , proteolytic - sensitivity experi - ments indicate that the a - catenin monomer has a conforma - tion different from that of the ba - catenin chimera ( Figure 3B ) . Thus , the inability of a - catenin to bind actin in the presence of b - catenin is probably due to conformational changes pro - duced when a - catenin monomer binds to the b - catenin - E - cadherin complex . Further structural studies will be needed to analyze these conformational changes in a - catenin . Figure 3 .

This was tested by incubating actin ﬁlaments with preassem - bled , gel ﬁltration - puriﬁed cadherin - catenin complex containing a 1 : 1 : 1 molar ratio of E - cadherin cytoplasmic do - main , b - catenin , and a - catenin at a series of concentrations ( Figure 4A ) or for different times ( Figure 4B ) . The actin ﬁla - ments were then pelleted , and bound proteins were identi - ﬁed . E - cadherin or b - catenin did not pellet above back - ground levels ( see also Yamada et al . , 2005 ) . However , a signiﬁcant fraction of a - catenin dissociated from the com - plex and pelleted with actin ﬁlaments independently of incu - bation time ( Figure 4B ) . The data obtained from the puriﬁed , recombinant proteins show that a - catenin can exchange between an E - cadherin - b - catenin complex and actin ﬁlaments in solution . We next tested whether this exchange occurs in cells . It was shown in the accompanying paper that GFP - labeled catenins dis - play signiﬁcant ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching at the membrane ( Yamada et al . , 2005 ) . Fluorescence recov - ery of peripheral membrane proteins can occur in two ways : lateral diffusion along the membrane surface in association with an integral membrane protein or exchange with the cytoplasmic pool . There is a signiﬁcant cytoplasmic pool of a - catenin that could exchange with membrane bound a - catenin ( Figure 4C ) . To test the extent of a - catenin ex - change between these pools , we measured the ﬂuores - cence loss of GFP - a - catenin at cell - cell contacts while con - tinuously photobleaching the cytoplasmic pool of GFP - a - catenin ( ﬂuorescence loss in photobleaching , FLIP ; Figure 4D and Movie S1 ) . The membrane bound pool of a - catenin , measured by subtracting the cytoplasmic ﬂuorescence in - tensity from that at cell - cell contacts , decreased by an aver - age of (cid:2) 10 % over a period of 9 min ( n = 15 ; Figures 4D and 4E ) , suggesting that a fraction of membrane bound a - cate - nin dissociated from b - catenin and entered the cytoplasm . Since the ﬂuorescence intensity of cytoplasmic GFP - b - cate - nin was near background levels ( see Yamada et al . , 2005 ) , as expected ( Na¨thke et al . , 1994 ) , we could not reliably mea - sure the dynamics of membrane bound GFP - b - catenin . It is possible that the observed exchange of a - catenin , as well as the recovery of GFP - tagged cadherins and catenins reported in the accompanying paper , is due to endocytosis of cadherin - catenin complexes from the membrane and fusion of cadherin - containing cytoplasmic vesicles at the Figure 4 .

However , novesiclefusion eventsthatcoincided with the ﬂuorescence recovery of E - cadherin or catenins were detected , although the temporal and spatial resolution of our microscope may not be sufﬁcient to reliably detect these events . Moreover , the half - life of E - cadherin in MDCK cells is (cid:2) 5 hr ( Shore and Nelson 1991 ) , which converts to a turnover of (cid:2) 1 % of E - cadherin over the period that the re - coverywasmeasured . Inaddition , theputative recycling pool of cadherin vesicles is < 2 % of total E - cadherin ( Le et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , these mechanisms may contribute to a small portion of a - catenin turnover , but direct exchange with the cytosolic pool is most likely to be the dominant mechanism . a - Catenin Suppresses Arp2 / 3 - Mediated Actin Polymerization The mobility of the cadherin - catenin complex is quantita - tively different from those of the membrane - associated and cytoplasmic pools of actin and several other actin binding proteins , observations consistent with in vitro binding experi - ments showing that the cadherin - catenin complex does not bind actin ( Yamada et al . , 2005 ) . Nevertheless , actin is asso - ciated with cell - cell contacts , and actin dynamics are impor - tant for induction of cell - cell adhesion ( Adams et al . , 1998 ; Ehrlich et al . , 2002 ; Vaezi et al . , 2002 ) , indicating that cad - herin - mediated cell - cell adhesion somehow induces changes in actin organization and dynamics . Therefore , we examined whether a - catenin can inﬂuence Arp2 / 3 com - plex - mediated actin assembly , which plays a central role in actin assembly and branching in lamellipodia ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) and is localized to sites of initiating cell - cell contact ( Kovacs et al . , 2002 ) . Actin polymerization in the presence of a - catenin , puriﬁed Arp2 / 3 complex , and the activation domain ( VCA ) of the Wis - kott - Aldrichsyndromeprotein ( WASp - VCA ) wasmeasuredin a standard pyrene - actin ﬂuorescence assay . As expected , Arp2 / 3 complex alone had little effect on actin polymeriza - tion , butitstronglyenhancedactinpolymerizationinthepres - ence of WASp - VCA ( Figure 5A ; Prehoda et al . , 2000 ) . The presence of a - catenin monomer or homodimer had little or no effect on actin polymerization ( data not shown ) . However , in the presence of the Arp2 / 3 complex and WASp - VCA , a - catenin monomer increased the initial lag phase of actin polymerization ( Figure 5B ) . This effect was signiﬁcantly re - duced by the addition of an equimolar amount of b - catenin ( Figure 5C ) ; b - catenin alone did not have an effect on actin polymerization in the presence of Arp2 / 3 - WASp ( Figure 5D ) . The ba - catenin chimera ( ba - cat ) , which mimics the b - catenin - a - catenin interaction and does not bind actin ﬁla - ments ( Yamada et al . , 2005 ) , also had no effect on actin polymerization induced by the Arp2 / 3 complex and WASp - VCA ( Figure 5E ) . In contrast to monomeric a - catenin , a - catenin homodimer completely suppressed actin polymerization in the presence of the Arp2 / 3 complex and WASp - VCA at 5 m M concentra - tion ( Figure 5F ) . The actin binding domain of a - catenin ( a - cat 671 – 906 ) , which is also a dimer ( S . P . , unpublished data ) , suppressedactinpolymerizationinducedbyArp2 / 3complex and WASp - VCA to an extent similar to that of the a - catenin homodimer ( Figure 5G ) . It is possible that bundling of actin ﬁl - aments by a - catenin homodimers ( Rimm et al . , 1995 ) steri - cally inhibited the Arp2 / 3 complex from binding to actin ﬁla - ments , thereby suppressing actin polymerization . However , addition of a - actinin , another actin - bundling protein , did not suppress actin polymerization induced by the Arp2 / 3 com - plex and WASp - VCA at 5 m M concentration ( Figure 5H ) . a - Catenin Competes with Arp2 / 3 for Binding to Actin Filaments at High Concentrations We sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which a - catenin suppresses Arp2 / 3 - WASp - VCA - stimulated actin polymerization . We ﬁrst tested whether a - catenin capped the growing barbed end of actin ﬁlaments or sequestered actin monomers by measuring the critical concentration for actin polymerization , which increases when the barbed end of actin ﬁlaments are capped . The critical concentration of actin in the presence and absence of 5 m M a - catenin was not signiﬁcantly different ( 0 . 1 m M and 0 . 07 m M , respectively ; Figure 6A ) . In the presence of a - catenin , the slope of the F - actin curve decreased , which is probably due to changes in pyrene ﬂuorescence when a - catenin binds to actin ﬁla - ments . The G - actin ﬂuorescence curve was not signiﬁcantly altered by the presence of a - catenin ( Figure 6A ) , and G - actin does not bind to GST - a - catenin in pull - down experiments ( data not shown ) . Finally , we asked whether suppression of actin polymerization in the presence of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex and WASp - VCA might be due to direct binding of a - cat - enin to , and sequestration of , the Arp2 / 3 complex . However , puriﬁed Arp2 / 3 complex did not bind to either a - catenin monomer or homodimer ( Figure 6B ) . Thus , a - catenin does not appear to cap the growing barbed end of actin ﬁlaments or sequester either G - actin or the Arp2 / 3 complex . The suppression of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization by a - catenin was concentration dependent ( Figure 6C ) and correlated with a - catenin binding to actin ﬁlaments ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . In the pyrene - actin polymerization assay , sup - pression began at 1 m M and 2 . 5 m M and reached full inhibi - tion at 7 . 5 m M and 15 m M for a - catenin homodimer and monomer , respectively . At intermediate concentrations ( 1 – 2 . 5 m M for homodimer ; 2 . 5 – 5 m M for monomer ) , a - catenin increased the lag phase of actin polymerization , but actin polymerization eventually proceeded rapidly . Although the concentration of a - catenin monomer and homodimer re - quired for complete suppression appears to differ only by a factor of two , we have to take into account that we are un - abletoisolate a - cateninmonomerwithoutsomecontaminat - ing homodimer . Therefore , the actual difference between the suppressive activities of a - catenin monomer and homodimer is likely to be more pronounced than that observed in these experiments . Addition of b - catenin reduced the inhibitory ef - fect of a - catenin ( Figure 5C ) ; since the a - catenin - b - catenin complex does not bind to actin ﬁlaments ( Yamada et al . , 2005 ) , the presence of b - catenin reduces the effective con - centration of a - catenin that can bind actin . In an actin cose - dimentation assay , the amount of Arp2 / 3 complex bound to actin ﬁlaments decreased as the concentration of a - catenin increased ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . Taken together , these results Cell 123 , 903 – 915 , December 2 , 2005 ª 2005 Elsevier Inc . 909 indicate that the suppressive effect of a - catenin on Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization is likely due to direct compe - tition with the Arp2 / 3 complex for binding to actin ﬁlaments . DISCUSSION Cell - cell contacts are considered to be stable structures that maintain the structural integrity of tissues and are thought to be formed by clustering of cell - adhesion proteins through binding between opposed extracellular domains and linkage through the cytoplasmic domain to the underlying actin cyto - skeleton ( Gumbiner , 2000 ; Jamora and Fuchs , 2002 ) . The cadherin cytoplasmic domain binds with high afﬁnity to b - catenin ( Huber et al . , 2001 ) , which in turn binds with weaker afﬁnity to a - catenin ( Pokutta and Weis , 2000 ) . Given that a - catenin binds to actin ﬁlaments ( Pokutta et al . , 2002 ; Figure 5 . a - Catenin Suppresses Arp2 / 3 - Mediated Actin Dynamics Effect of a - catenin , b - catenin , and a - actinin on Arp2 / 3 - mediatedactinpolymerizationmeasured by pyrene - actin assay .

However , direct tests of this model failed . In the accompanying paper , we showed that a - cate - nin does not bind simultaneously to the cadherin - catenin complex and actin ﬁlaments ( Yamada et al . , 2005 ) . These re - sults predict that interactions between the cadherin - catenin Figure 6 . a - Catenin Competes with Arp2 / 3 for Binding to Actin Filaments ( A ) Critical concentration of actin in the presence or absence of 5 m M a - catenin homodimer .

Although direct interactions between the cadherin com - plex and actin ﬁlaments were not veriﬁed experimentally , there is a considerable body of work concluding that some sort of interaction of actin ﬁlaments and the cadherin - catenin complex is important in cell - cell adhesion . Cytochalasin D and latrunculin A , which change the dynamic organization of the actin cytoskeleton , reduce adhesion and weaken cell - cell contacts ( Angres et al . , 1996 ; Chu et al . , 2004 ; Im - amura et al . , 1999 ; Matsuzaki et al . , 1990 ) . However , these drugs have global effects on actin organization that are not restricted to effects on only cell - cell contacts . Genetic dele - tion of a - catenin potentially provides a more direct approach to disrupt the putative cadherin - actin linkage . Cell - cell adhe - sion in a - catenin null cells is reduced and could be rescued by re - expression of a - catenin ( Bullions et al . , 1997 ; Hirano et al . , 1992 ; van Hengel et al . , 1997 ; Watabe et al . , 1994 ; Watabe - Uchida et al . , 1998 ) . However , it is noted that cell - cell adhesion occurred in some a - catenin null cells ( Maeno et al . , 1999 ) , presumably because there was sufﬁcient cadherin on the cell surface to initiate cell - cell adhesion . a - catenin null cells have also been used to express chimeras between a - catenin - E - cadherin ( Imamura et al . , 1999 ; Naga - fuchi et al . , 1994 ; Ozawa and Kemler , 1998 ) , a - catenin - vinculin ( Ozawa and Kemler , 1998 ; Watabe - Uchida et al . , 1998 ) , and a - catenin - formin - 1 ( Kobielak et al . , 2004 ) , all of which partially rescue cell - cell adhesion . However , no direct evidence was presented in those studies that these chimeric proteins bound actin ﬁlaments . Moreover , our ﬁndings that the molecular and functional properties of a - catenin are altered upon binding to b - catenin—in particular , that the a - catenin / b - catenin complex cannot bind actin—demonstrate that the use of E - cadherin - a - catenin chimeras cannot reca - pitulate the behavior of the cadherin - catenin complex at the membrane . It is possible that expression of some of these chimeric proteins could locally change actin dynamics or simply increase the amount of cadherin at the cell surface to a level that can partially rescue cell - cell adhesion . Although it is surprising that a stable linkage does not exist between cadherins and the underlying actin cytoskel - eton , cell - cell adhesion is a dynamic process during embry - onic development , wound healing , and cancer cell metas - tasis ( Takeichi , 1995 ; Thiery , 2002 ) . This may require a more dynamic interaction between cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton rather than the static , stable linkage proposed in previous models . In addition , it is noteworthy that , in most cell types , cadherins are not the only means of cell - cell adhesion . Many other adhesion proteins are expressed , including members of the nectin occludin / claudin , JAM , and desmosomal cadherin families ( Gestsios et al . , 2004 ; Takai and Nakanishi , 2003 ) , all of which are thought to interact directly or indirectly with the actin or intermediate ﬁlament cytoskeletons and thereby contribute to cell - cell adhesion . There are dramatic changes in membrane and actin dy - namics associated with the formation of cell - cell adhesions . Initial cell - cell contact formation is driven by overlapping membrane lamellipodia from contacting cells . These lamelli - podia are regulated by actin polymerization and branching induced by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Kovacs et al . , 2002 ) and lo - cal activation of the Rho family of small GTPases ( Braga , 2002 ; Fukata and Kaibuchi , 2001 ) . However , lamellipodial activity decays as the cadherin - catenin complex accumu - lates and the contacts mature into stable cell - cell junctions ( Ehrlich et al . , 2002 ; Vaezi et al . , 2002 ) . It is not known what regulates this contact - dependent decrease of mem - brane activity , which presumably depends upon a decrease in Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization . It is interesting to note , in this context , that decreased levels of a - catenin result in increased membrane activity in hippocampal neurons , while overexpression of a - catenin suppress membrane ac - tivity ( Abe et al . , 2004 ) , indicating that a - catenin directly reg - ulates membrane protrusive activity . Furthermore , keratino - cytes from a - catenin knockout mice are characterized by loss of contact inhibition and increased migratory activity ( Vasioukhin et al . , 2001 ) . How might changes in both actin assembly and organiza - tion ( from networks to bundles ; see Hirokawa et al . , 1983 ) that drive the transition from active lamellipodia to quiescent contacts ( see Ehrlich et al . , 2002 ) be coordinated during the formation of cell - cell adhesions ? Our ﬁnding that a - catenin suppresses Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization in a concentration - dependent manner , combined with the actin bundling activity of a - catenin ( Rimm et al . , 1995 ) , may pro - vide an explanation ( Figure 7 ) . The cytoplasmic a - catenin monomer concentration ( 0 . 6 m M ) is too low to bind actin sig - niﬁcantly and would need to be concentrated to bind actin and to dimerize . A signiﬁcant increase in the local concentra - tion of a - catenin at the membrane occurs upon accumula - tion of the cadherin - catenin complex at nascent contacts . This cadherin bound pool of a - catenin can exchange with the cytoplasmic pool ( Figure 4 ) ; note that we probably under - estimate the amount of exchange because we cannot di - rectly measure it locally at cell - cell contacts . Although the lo - cal concentrations of a - catenin and Arp2 / 3 immediately adjacent to contacting membranes are unknown , a 10 - fold increase in local concentration of a - catenin would be sufﬁ - cient for a - catenin to compete with the Arp2 / 3 complex for actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 7 ) . This would suppress formation of branched actin networks and inhibit lamellipodial activity and would also favor formation of a - catenin homodimers that bundle actin ﬁlaments ( Rimm et al . , 1995 ) , resulting in a reorganization of actin ﬁlaments and a change in mem - brane dynamics underneath the junction ( Figure 7 ) . It has also been proposed that formins , which promote formation of linear actin cables , are recruited to the adherens junc - tion by a - catenin ( Kobielak et al . , 2004 ) . If so , a - catenin would serve as a switch that turns off Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched - actin - network formation required for lamellipodial activity during the initiation of adhesion and turn on a - catenin - mediated bundling of actin ﬁlaments and formation of linear cables by formins during maturation of the adherens junction . While further work is needed to test speciﬁc tenets of this hypothesis , our results provide new mechanistic in - sights into many aspects of the local dynamics of actin and 912 Cell 123 , 903 – 915 , December 2 , 2005 ª 2005 Elsevier Inc . membranes associated with cell - cell contacts not ac - counted for in previous models . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation E - cadherin cytoplasmic domain , b - catenin , plakoglobin , a - catenin , and the b - catenin - a - catenin chimera were expressed and puriﬁed as de - scribed in the accompanying paper ( Yamada et al . , 2005 ) . Chromatography Analytical size exclusion chromatography was done in 20 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 1 mM DTT on a Superdex 200 column . Proteins were injected at a 25 . 6 m M concentration . For binding studies , proteins were mixed and incubated overnight at 4ºC . Multiangle Light Scattering a - catenin monomer and ba - catenin were analyzed on a Superdex 200 columnattachedtoaUVdetectorfollowedbyamultianglelightscattering ( MALS ) DAWN EOS ( Wyatt Technology , Santa Barbara ) and a refractive index ( RI ) detector . The system was equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 1 mM DTT , and the response of the light scattering detector was normalized by measuring the signal of monomeric bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) . A value of 0 . 185 ml / g was as - sumed for the dn / dc of BSA and a - catenin . Scattering intensities mea - sured at nine different angles ( detectors 7 – 15 ) were used for data analy - sis .

Actin Pelleting , Pyrene Polymerization , and Critical - Concentration Assay Actin was prepared from chicken pectoral muscle as described ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) and was further puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration . Pyrene - labeled actin was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc . Arp2 / 3 complex and WASp - VCA were generous gifts from Dr . M . J . Footer ( Stanford University ) . Actin polymerization rates were measured by the change of pyrene - actin ﬂuo - rescence upon incorporation into actin ﬁlaments using a Fluorolog3 Spectroﬂuorometer ( Jobin Yvon Horiba ) . The ﬁnal concentration of actin , a - catenin monomer / dimer , a - catenin tail domain , b - catenin , a - actinin , and ba - catenin was 5 m M ; the concentration of Arp 2 / 3 and VCA was 50nMintheassaysorasindicated . Thecriticalconcentration ofactinpo - lymerization was determined in F buffer ( 20 mM Tris [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 50 mM KCl , 2mMMgCl 2 , 0 . 2mMCaCl 2 , 0 . 5mMDTT ) orGbuffer ( 5mMTris [ pH8 . 0 ] , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) as described ( Mullins and Ma - chesky , 2000 ) . Samples from pyrene assays were collected , incubated for 2 hr at room temperature , and centrifuged at 435 , 000 (cid:1) g ( Beckman TL - 100 ) for 7 min . Supernatant and pellet were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting using mouse anti - a - catenin , rabbit anti - Arp3 , and mouse anti - actin , and the resulting blots were scanned with the Odyssey infrared imaging system ( LI - COR , Inc . ) .
