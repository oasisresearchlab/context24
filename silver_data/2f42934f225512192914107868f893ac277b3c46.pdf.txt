ATP binding by Arp2 and Arp3 was required for full Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation activity in vitro . Analysis of actin dynamics and endocytosis in mutants demonstrated that nucleotide - bound Arp3 is particularly important for Arp2 / 3 complex function in vivo . Severity of endocytic defects did not cor - relate with effects on in vitro nucleation activity , suggesting that a critical Arp2 / 3 complex function during endocytosis C may be structural rather than catalytic . A separate class of Arp2 and Arp3 NBP mutants suppressed phenotypes of mutants defective for actin nucleation . An Arp2 suppressor mutant increased Arp2 / 3 nucleation activity . Electron microscopy of Arp2 / 3 complex containing this Arp2 suppressor identiﬁed a structural change that also occurs upon Arp2 / 3 activation by nucleation promoting factors . These data demonstrate the importance of Arp2 and Arp3 nucleotide binding for nucleating activity , and Arp3 nucleotide binding for maintenance of cortical actin cytoskeleton cytoarchitecture . Introduction Spatial and temporal regulation of actin polymerization are criti - cal for cellular processes such as cell migration and endocytosis ( Welch and Mullins , 2002 ; Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ) . Because nucleation is rate limiting for actin polymeriza - tion , regulation of this step controls when and where actin is assembled in cells . An important nucleator of actin filaments is the Arp2 / 3 complex , a seven subunit complex that includes two actin - related proteins ( Arps ) 2 and 3 ( Welch and Mullins , 2002 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates actin filaments de novo , and from the sides of preexisting filaments , generating a branched filament array ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000 ) resembling those observed at the leading edge of certain motile cells ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . Nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) , such as members of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family of proteins , activate Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation activity , allowing regulated actin assembly that can generate forces in cells ( Welch and Mul - lins , 2002 ) . Elucidating the mechanisms that regulate Arp2 / 3 complex function is essential for understanding the dynamics of actin - based force generation . Nucleotide binding plays a critical role in regulation of actin dynamics . ATP binding by actin promotes actin filament assembly by closing the nucleotide - binding pocket ( NBP ) . ATP hydrolysis and P i release results in a transition from the “closed” to the “open” state , promoting actin filament disassembly ( Bel - mont et al . , 1999a ; Sablin et al . , 2002 ) . Similarly , Arp2 and Arp3 bind ATP , and the Arp2 / 3 complex requires ATP for nu - cleation ( Dayel et al . , 2001 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2001 ) . Arp2 ATP hydrolysis was linked to both the dissociation of actin fila - ment branches ( Le Clainche et al . , 2003 ) , and to nucleation ( Dayel and Mullins , 2004 ) . In the crystal structure of nucle - otide - free Arp2 / 3 complex , the Arp2 and Arp3 NBPs resemble that of actin in the “open” conformation ( Robinson et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , ATP binding may close the NBPs of Arp2 and Arp3 such that they can serve as a nucleus for actin polymerization . In addition to regulating the association of the Arp2 / 3 complex with actin , nucleotide binding by Arp2 / 3 complex is linked to NPF binding . ATP - bound Arp2 / 3 exhibits higher affinity for NPFs than ADP - bound complex ( Dayel et al . , 2001 ) . Furthermore , Arp2 ATP binding was reported to be enhanced by NPFs , and to be required for efficient Arp2 / 3 complex activation ( Le Clainche et al . , 2001 ) . Similar to ATP , actin filaments also enhance Arp2 / 3 complex affinity for NPFs ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) .

JCB • VOLUME 168 • NUMBER 2 • 2005 316 ( Robinson et al . , 2001 ) , it is possible that the cooperative binding of ATP , NPFs , and actin filaments bring Arp2 and Arp3 together to form a template dimer for nucleation . Cryo - electron micros - copy of the Arp2 / 3 complex in actin filament branches revealed that a large conformational change in the Arp2 / 3 complex repre - sented in the crystal model is required for Arp2 / 3 activation ( Volkmann et al . , 2001 ) . These conformational changes are likely to be influenced by the nucleotide state of Arp2 and Arp3 . Although ATP has been demonstrated to be important for Arp2 / 3 nucleation in vitro , the contributions of ATP - bound Arp2 or Arp3 to in vitro and in vivo function have not been de - termined individually . Here , we generated NPB mutations of S . cerevisiae Arp2 and Arp3 to explore the individual contribu - tions of nucleotide to the function of each protein . Results Identification of Arp2 and Arp3 mutants that affect nucleotide binding To test the function of ATP binding by Arp2 and Arp3 , we gen - erated 26 site - directed mutations that changed conserved resi - dues in the NBPs of these two proteins ( Fig . 1 ; Table S1 , avail - able at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200408177 / DC1 ) . We attempted to make mutations that would affect nucleotide affinity , hydrolysis , and exchange . Mutants were chosen based on previous mutations of actin ( Wertman et al . , 1992 ; Chen et al . , 1995 ; Belmont and Drubin , 1998 ; Belmont et al . , 1999b ) and on predictions based on the actin crystal structure ( Kabsch et al . , 1990 ; Vorobiev et al . , 2003 ) . Residue numbers used to refer to mutants correspond to the amino acid position in the yeast actin sequence . Mutants were integrated into the endoge - nous ARP2 and ARP3 chromosomal loci and were assessed for growth on different media ( Table S1 ) . Immunoblotting re - vealed that mutants expressed wild - type levels of Arp2 and Arp3 ( unpublished data ) . Although viable arp2 (cid:1) and arp3 (cid:1) mutant strains have been observed ( Winter et al . , 1999 ) , dele - tion of either gene resulted in lethality under our growth condi - tions . Surprisingly , all but one of the integrated Arp2 and Arp3 mutants were viable , suggesting that they retain partial func - tion , and allowing further characterization of their effects . Because ATP is required for Arp2 / 3 nucleation activity in vitro ( Dayel et al . , 2001 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2001 ) , we predicted that mutants affecting ATP binding would decrease Arp2 / 3 function in vivo . Two mutants predicted to lower nucleotide binding affinity , arp3 - D11A and arp3 - G302Y , showed growth defects at high temperature and high osmolarity ( Table S1 ) . The arp3 - D11A mutant was predicted to lower nucleotide affinity by removing an aspartic acid that interacts with divalent cation , Figure 1 . Arp2 and Arp3 residues chosen for mutagenesis .

GENETIC DISSECTION OF ATP BINDING BY ARP2 / 3 COMPLEX • MARTIN ET AL . 317 whereas the arp3 - G302Y mutant was predicted to prevent nucle - otide binding by introducing a tyrosine into the adenine - binding pocket . Interestingly , the analogous Arp2 mutations , arp2 - D11A and arp2 - G302Y , exhibited less severe growth phenotypes . To further analyze the effects of these mutants , we crossed arp3 - G302Y and arp2 - G302Y to several arp2 and arp3 alleles , re - spectively . In addition , we crossed these mutants to las17 - 11 , a temperature - sensitive allele of the gene encoding a yeast WASP - like NPF ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ) . arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y showed synthetic lethality with each other and with las17 - 11 ( Table I ) . In addition , arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y exhibited synthetic lethality with arp3 - D11A and arp2 - D11A , respectively ( Table I ) . Thus , the arp2 - D11A , arp3 - D11A , arp2 - G302Y , and arp3 - G302Y mutants impaired Arp2 / 3 function in vivo , possibly indicating a defect in nucleotide binding . Surprisingly , we identified two mutants , arp2 - D157E and arp2 - Y306A , that partially suppressed the arp3 - G302Y phenotype , with arp2 - Y306A being the stronger suppressor ( Table I ) . Suppression was not allele specific because arp2 - Y306A also partially suppressed arp3 - D11A and las17 - 11 ( Ta - ble I ) . In addition , arp2 - Y306A exhibited intragenic suppres - sion of arp2 - G13C ( Table I ) . The analogous Arp3 mutation , arp3 - F306A , suppressed both arp2 - D11A and arp3 - G15C ( Table I ) . Thus , arp2 - Y306A and arp3 - F306A represented a class of NBP mutant that appeared to increase the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex . ATP binding to Arp2 and Arp3 mutants To determine if the D11A , G302Y , and Y ( F ) 306A mutations af - fected nucleotide binding , we purified the Arp2 / 3 complex from these mutants ( Fig . 2 A ) . Similar amounts of purified pro - tein were obtained for each strain and most of these mutant complexes showed normal subunit compositions . However , we were unable to determine the stoichiometry of Arc40 due to its abnormal mobility on SDS - PAGE gels ( Pan et al . , 2004 ) . Inter - estingly , Arp2 / 3 complex from arp2 - D11A exhibited notice - able Arp3 degradation , indicating that Arp2 can contribute to the stability of Arp3 ( Fig . 2 A ) . The ability of mutant complexes to bind ATP was as - sessed using a photo - cross - linking assay previously used to ex - amine ATP binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Dayel et al . , 2001 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2001 ) . For wild - type yeast Arp2 / 3 complex , (cid:3) - [ 32 P ] ATP was cross - linked to Arp2 and Arp3 , and addition of the Arp2 / 3 - activating WCA domain of Las17 did not substan - tially affect this cross - linking , similar to what was observed for Acanthamoeba Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 2 B ; Dayel et al . , 2001 ) . The arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y mutations dramatically decreased ATP cross - linking to Arp2 and Arp3 , respectively , which is consistent with the prediction that this change steri - cally inhibits nucleotide binding ( Fig . 2 B ) . These mutations did not affect ATP cross - linking by the nonmutated Arp subunit , suggesting that ATP binding by Arp2 and Arp3 are indepen - dent , although we cannot rule out subtle effects on conforma - tion . Surprisingly , the arp2 - Y306A and arp3 - F306A mutations also decreased ATP cross - linking to Arp2 and Arp3 , respec - tively , despite their ability to suppress other mutants . However , Arp2 - Y306A ATP cross - linking was reproducibly increased to (cid:1) 70 % of wild type by Las17 WCA ( Fig . 2 B ) . The arp2 - D11A and arp3 - D11A mutations had a lesser effect on nucleotide cross - linking , suggesting that these mutants have milder effects on ATP binding ( Fig . 2 B ) . We confirmed the ATP binding defects of our mutants us - ing a fluorescent derivative of ATP , etheno - ATP , which in - creases in fluorescence upon binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex . Al - though this assay is more quantitative than the cross - linking assay , it cannot be used to distinguish between binding to Arp2 or Arp3 in the wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex . We found that wild - type yeast Arp2 / 3 complex binds to etheno - ATP with a K d of 2 . 3 (cid:4) M ( Fig . 2 C ) . Arp2 / 3 complex from arp3 - G302Y and arp3 - F306A was saturated with etheno - ATP at (cid:1) 25 % the fluo - rescence of wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex , further suggesting that Arp3 - G302Y and Arp3 - F306A did not bind ATP under these Table I .

JCB • VOLUME 168 • NUMBER 2 • 2005 318 conditions ( Fig . 2 C ) . The residual fluorescence increase is likely due to Arp2 etheno - ATP binding , with a calculated K d of (cid:1) 20 (cid:4) M . This value agrees with previous results showing a low af - finity of Arp2 for ATP in the absence of an NPF ( Le Clainche et al . , 2001 ) . arp3 - D11A Arp2 / 3 complex showed a greater fluores - cence increase , but exhibited a 15 - fold higher K d , suggesting that Arp3 - D11A bound etheno - ATP with lower affinity ( Fig . 2 C ) . In contrast , arp2 mutant complexes exhibited similar affinity to wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex and only moderately decreased the fluorescence at saturation ( Fig . 2 D ) . Thus , the fluorescence in - crease is mostly due to Arp3 etheno - ATP binding , with a calcu - lated K d of (cid:1) 2 (cid:4) M , similar to the previously determined value ( Dayel et al . , 2001 ) . Overall , the cross - linking and etheno - ATP binding experiments demonstrated that the D11A , G302Y , and Y ( F ) 306A mutants lower the affinity of Arp2 and Arp3 for ATP , with the G302Y mutant being most severely defective . Arp3 nucleotide binding is required for normal actin organization and endocytosis The Arp2 / 3 complex localizes to yeast cortical actin patches ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ; Winter et al . , 1997 ) , and Arp2 / 3 complex mutants show defects in actin patch polarity ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ; Madania et al . , 1999 ; Winter et al . , 1999 ) and in endocy - tosis ( Moreau et al . , 1996 , 1997 ) . To test the importance of Arp2 and Arp3 nucleotide binding in vivo , we first examined actin cytoskeleton organization in fixed cells using rhodamine phalloidin . At 25 (cid:5) C , actin patches in arp2 - D11A , arp3 - D11A , and arp3 - G302Y mutants were more depolarized than in wild - type cells ( Fig . 3 A , Table II ) . In addition , (cid:1) 10 – 20 % of arp3 - G302Y cells and a few percent of arp2 - D11A and arp3 - D11A cells exhibited cable - like actin aggregates , similar to those pre - viously observed in arp3 - 2 mutant cells ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) . Actin patches became almost completely depolarized when arp3 - D11A and arp3 - G302Y cells were shifted to the restric - tive temperature of 37 (cid:5) C for 1 h ( Fig . 3 A ) . Consistent with previous findings ( Winter et al . , 1999 ) , actin cables were present in all mutants at all temperatures . In contrast to arp3 - G302Y , actin patches in arp2 - G302Y were of normal size and were polarized at both 25 (cid:5) C and 37 (cid:5) C ( Fig . 3 A ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex localized to actin patches in both arp2 and arp3 mu - tants , although with slightly less intensity than in wild - type cells ( Fig . 3 B ) . We were unable to examine arp3 - G302Y local - ization because of synthetic sickness with HA - tagged ARC18 . Figure 2 . ATP binding of Arp2 and Arp3 mutants .

GENETIC DISSECTION OF ATP BINDING BY ARP2 / 3 COMPLEX • MARTIN ET AL . 319 Interestingly , actin organization and Arp2 / 3 localization in arp2 - Y306A and arp3 - F306A mutants were indistinguishable from wild type ( unpublished data ) , suggesting that these mu - tants did not decrease Arp2 / 3 activity . Because the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin patches have been implicated in yeast endocytosis ( Moreau et al . , 1996 , 1997 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) , we tested endocytic function by visualizing uptake of the fluid phase dye , Lucifer yellow ( LY ) at 25 (cid:5) C . The arp3 - D11A and arp3 - G302Y mutants showed a dramatic reduction in LY staining in the vacuole ( Fig . 3 C ) . However , the arp2 - Y306A and arp3 - F306A mutants showed similar LY internalization to wild - type cells ( Table II ) . The arp2 - Y306A mutant suppressed the LY internalization defect of arp3 - G302Y ( Fig . 3 C ) . Importantly , LY uptake was only moderately impaired in arp2 - G302Y and arp2 - D11A mutant cells , which is consistent with the more mild effect on growth and actin organization ( Fig . 3 C ) . Therefore , Arp3 nucleotide binding is more important compared with Arp2 nucleotide binding for endocytosis , the major function of cortical actin patches . Figure 3 .

JCB • VOLUME 168 • NUMBER 2 • 2005 320 Arp3 nucleotide binding is required for Abp1 and Sla1 internalization We next determined which steps in endocytic internalization are affected in Arp3 mutants . An endocytic pathway has been elucidated in which the behavior of yeast cortical patches is correlated with invariant changes in the protein composition of these patches over time ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Early compo - nents of this pathway , such as the endocytic adaptor Sla1 , as - semble as patches at the plasma membrane and remain stably associated with the membrane until they are internalized after (cid:1) 20 – 30 s . Late patch components , such as actin , Arp2 / 3 com - plex , and the actin filament binding protein , Abp1 , are re - cruited to Sla1 containing patches later , and movement of actin and Abp1 off the plasma membrane coincides with Sla1 inter - nalization . The Arp2 / 3 complex has previously been shown to be important for actin patch motility ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) , but its importance in the context of the recently defined endocytic pathway had not yet been investigated . Abp1 - GFP , a marker for filamentous actin , and Sla1 - GFP were crossed to the D11A , G302Y , and Y ( F ) 306A mu - tants to visualize the dynamics of these proteins in live mutant cells . Similar results were obtained using either Sac6 - GFP or Abp1 - GFP as a marker for actin ( unpublished data ) , demon - strating that Abp1 - GFP is a suitable marker for filamentous actin in these cells . The arp2 - D11A , arp3 - D11A , and arp3 - G302Y mutants significantly decreased internalization of both Abp1 and Sla1 patches at 25 (cid:5) C ( Fig . 4 , A and B ; Table II ; Vid - eos 1 and 2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200408177 / DC1 ) . This internalization defect resulted in significantly longer lifetimes for Sla1 cortical patches in these arp2 and arp3 mutants ( Table II ) . In contrast , internalization of Abp1 and Sla1 patches was only moderately reduced in the arp2 - G302Y mutant ( Fig . 4 , A and B , Videos 1 and 2 ) . Thus , Abp1 and Sla1 internalization defects correlated with endocy - tosis defects observed by LY uptake , which is consistent with the conclusion that patch internalization represents endocytic internalization ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . The arp2 - Y306A mu - tant , while exhibiting wild - type Abp1 and Sla1 patch inter - nalization , partially suppressed the internalization defects of arp3 - G302Y , which is consistent with its suppression of the LY internalization defect ( Fig . 4 A , Table II ) . The internalization defects of Arp3 mutants could have resulted from loss of spatial or temporal regulation of actin assembly at endocytic sites . Interestingly , the rate of Abp1 patch assembly was slightly decreased in both arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y ( Fig . 4 C ) , resulting in longer Abp1 patch lifetimes in these mutants ( Table II ) . In addition , the onset of actin assembly was significantly delayed in both arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y relative to the initial appearance of Sla1 patches ( Fig . 4 D ) . Thus , nucleotide - bound Arp2 and Arp3 are required to initiate actin polymerization at en - docytic sites with the proper timing . However , the internal - ization defects observed in arp3 - G302Y could not be explained by actin assembly defects . Arp2 and Arp3 mutants form defective actin comet tails in sla2 (cid:1) mutants To further investigate the basis for the Arp3 mutant internal - ization defect , we analyzed the effects of the arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y mutants on actin polymerization at endo - cytic sites by taking advantage of the sla2 (cid:1) mutant pheno - type . Deletion of the SLA2 gene blocks Sla1 internalization and results in the formation of actin comet tails that associate with Sla1 - containing patches at the plasma membrane ( Kak - sonen et al . , 2003 ) . Clusters of actin comet tails can be ob - served in sla2 (cid:1) cells expressing GFP - tagged actin , and the treadmilling rate can be measured by the directional FRAP ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Surprisingly , photo - bleaching of actin comet tails in sla2 (cid:1) arp2 - G302Y or sla2 (cid:1) arp3 - G302Y mutants revealed that Table II .

GENETIC DISSECTION OF ATP BINDING BY ARP2 / 3 COMPLEX • MARTIN ET AL . 321 the rate of actin treadmilling was only slightly reduced com - pared with the rate in wild - type cells ( Fig . 5 A ) . This was consistent with the relatively normal assembly of actin at en - docytic sites described above . Importantly , however , the con - tinuity of actin tails in sla2 (cid:1) arp3 - G302Y cells was se - verely disrupted . Whereas actin tails in sla2 (cid:1) mutants appeared smooth and continuous , all sla2 (cid:1) arp3 - G302Y actin tails ex - hibited a broken structure ( Fig . 5 B , Video 3 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200408177 / DC1 ) . In these mutants , clumps of actin appeared to separate from the plasma membrane and to move into the cytoplasm at a continuous rate ( Fig . 5 C ) .

JCB • VOLUME 168 • NUMBER 2 • 2005 322 arp2 - G302Y tails ( Fig . 5 B and C ) , although the remaining tails appeared similar to wild - type . Thus , the arp3 - G302Y mutant , which has an endocytic internalization defect , more severely affected the continuity of actin comet tails . In vitro nucleation activity of Arp2 and Arp3 mutants To determine whether the more severe endocytic defects of Arp3 mutants versus Arp2 mutants reflected lower Arp2 / 3 nucleation activity , we used the pyrene - actin assembly as - say . The in vitro nucleation activity of mutant Arp2 / 3 com - plexes activated by full - length Las17 ( Rodal et al . , 2003 ) was examined . Unless otherwise noted , we used 500 (cid:4) M ATP in our assays to approximate physiological conditions . Surprisingly , the Arp2 / 3 complex from arp2 - G302Y , which had only a subtle effect in cells , and the Arp2 / 3 complex from arp3 - G302Y and arp3 - D11A , which caused severe ef - fects in cells , exhibited a similar decrease in activity ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . The nucleation activity of these mutant Arp2 / 3 complexes was equivalent to that exhibited when the concen - tration of wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex was lowered 20 - fold ( Fig . 6 A ) . Arp2 / 3 complex from arp2 - D11A showed the lowest nucleation activity , which is consistent with this mu - tant affecting Arp3 stability as well as Arp2 nucleotide bind - ing ( Fig . 6 B ) . The nucleation activities of arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y Arp2 / 3 complex were similar to each other with different concentrations of NPF , nucleotide , and actin , as well as with the NPFs Pan1 and Abp1 ( Fig . 6 , B and C , not depicted ) . In addition , arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y Arp2 / 3 complexes exhibited a similar reduction in the number of Y - branches formed compared with wild - type Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( Fig . 6 D ) . Therefore , the endocytic defects of the arp3 - G302Y mutant did not correlate with effects on Arp2 / 3 nu - cleation or branch formation activities . Interestingly , we found that whereas wild - type Arp2 / 3 nu - cleation activity was saturated at 200 nM Las17 , arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y were not , suggesting that these mutants might decrease nucleation activity in part by lowering the affinity for NPF ( Fig . 6 B ) . To test this hypothesis , we pulled down Arp2 / 3 complex with various amounts of WCA - coated beads . Wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex bound Las17 WCA with a K d of (cid:1) 4 (cid:4) M , slightly higher than that reported for WCA from WASP and N - WASP ( 0 . 2 – 2 (cid:4) M ; Dayel et al . , 2001 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2001 ; Marchand et al . , 2001 ; Panchal et al . , 2003 ) . Surprisingly , both arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y Arp2 / 3 complexes bound Las17 WCA with similar affinity to the wild - type Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( Fig . 6 E ) . Furthermore , neither arp2 - G302Y nor arp3 - G302Y significantly affected Arp2 / 3 affinity for the sides of ac - tin filaments ( unpublished data ) . Thus , the low activity of these mutants was not due to reduced NPF affinity . Because arp2 - Y306A and arp3 - F306A suppressed Arp2 / 3 mutant phenotypes in vivo , we purified Arp2 / 3 complex from arp2 - Y306A and arp3 - F306A to determine the biochemical ba - sis for this suppression . Despite lowering affinity for ATP ( Fig . 2 ) , arp3 - F306A Arp2 / 3 complex exhibited wild - type nucleation activity , whereas the arp2 - Y306A Arp2 / 3 complex increased nucleation activity with the NPF Las17 , exhibiting an activ - ity equivalent to a fourfold higher concentration of wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 6 , B and F ) . In addition , arp2 - Y306A ex - hibited two - to fourfold higher activity in the absence of an NPF , similar to that of wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex activated with the less active Las17 WCA ( Fig . 6 G ) . Despite this increase in ac - tivity , the arp2 - Y306A mutant did not restore nucleation activity to Arp2 / 3 complex containing arp3 - G302Y ( Fig . 6 H ) , and it failed Figure 5 .

JCB • VOLUME 168 • NUMBER 2 • 2005 324 to rescue Arp3 nucleotide binding of arp3 - G302Y ( Fig . 2 C ) , suggesting that in vivo suppression by the arp2 - Y306A mutant does not simply restore nucleotide binding to Arp3 . The arp2 - Y306A suppressor results in a conformational change that mimics Arp2 / 3 complex activation We next used electron microscopy and image analysis to identify conformational changes that occur upon activation of wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex . In addition , because the Arp2 / 3 complex con - taining the arp2 - Y306A mutant exhibited constitutive activity similar to wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex activated by Las17 WCA ( Fig . 6 G ) , we tested whether the arp2 - Y306A mutation mimics the Arp2 / 3 complex activation step induced by NPF binding . Non - activated wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex , the arp2 - Y306A Arp2 / 3 mutant , and wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex bound to Las17 WCA , were imaged by electron microscopy in negative stain ( Fig . 7 ) . Single - particle analysis resulted in three reconstructions at (cid:1) 2 . 5 nm resolution ( Fig . 7 E ) , considerably higher than the 3 . 9 nm resolution previously reported for the yeast Arp2 / 3 complex ( Volkmann et al . , 2001 ) . Fitting the atomic model of the nonacti - vated bovine Arp2 / 3 complex ( Robinson et al . , 2001 ) into the three - dimensional maps revealed that the overall morphology of all three reconstructions resembles that of the crystal structure ( Fig . 7 A ) . However , differences in the density distribution be - tween the activated and the nonactivated wild - type Arp2 / 3 re - constructions are clearly visible in the Arp2 and Arc15 regions ( Fig . 7 , B and D ) . This observation shows for the first time a distinct structural change upon Arp2 / 3 complex activation by WCA . Interestingly , no significant differences were observed when the nonactivated arp2 - Y306A mutant reconstruction was compared with the activated wild - type Arp2 / 3 map . Thus , the structural changes induced by NPF binding in the wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex are similar to those observed in the mutant com - plex in the absence of NPF . These structural similarities explain the close resemblance of the nucleation activities of the mutant and the activated wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 6 G ) and sug - gest that arp2 - Y306A suppresses other mutants by causing the Arp2 / 3 complex to resemble the active conformation . Discussion We have generated mutants that affect either Arp2 or Arp3 nu - cleotide binding . Based on the effects of these mutants on en - Figure 7 .

GENETIC DISSECTION OF ATP BINDING BY ARP2 / 3 COMPLEX • MARTIN ET AL . 325 docytosis and in vitro nucleation activity , we present a model for the functions of nucleotide - bound Arp2 and Arp3 in Fig . 8 . First , ATP - bound Arp2 and Arp3 are both required for full acti - vation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by NPFs in vitro ( Fig . 8 A ) . Moreover , a structural change in Arp2 accompanies activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by an NPF , as observed by electron mi - croscopy . The resulting nucleation activity is important for ef - ficiently initiating actin polymerization at endocytic sites ( Fig . 8 B , i ) . Once actin filaments are nucleated , actin assembly can proceed , albeit more slowly , with minimal Arp2 / 3 nucleation activity . Finally , Arp2 / 3 complex , particularly nucleotide bind - ing by Arp3 , plays a yet to be defined role , possibly anchoring actin filaments to each other and to the plasma membrane , to allow polymerization forces to be harnessed for endocytic in - ternalization ( Fig . 8 , A and B , ii ) . The evidence supporting this model is discussed below . Importance of Arp2 and Arp3 nucleotide binding for actin filament nucleation Of the mutants we characterized , arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y most dramatically inhibited ATP binding to Arp2 and Arp3 , re - spectively . Previous studies reported that ATP binding is re - quired for Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation activity , but these stud - ies were unable to tease apart the individual contributions of ATP binding to Arp2 versus Arp3 ( Dayel et al . , 2001 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2001 ) . Here , we demonstrated using the G302Y mutants that ATP - bound Arp2 and Arp3 both contribute to Arp2 / 3 nucleation activity in vitro . Importantly , raising the ATP concentration to physiological levels did not increase the in vitro nucleation activity of these mutant complexes , suggest - ing that their nucleation activities in vivo resemble those of nu - cleotide - free Arp2 and Arp3 complexes . Previous studies suggested that nucleotide - bound Arp2 and Arp3 are important for WCA binding ( Dayel et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y Arp2 / 3 complexes bound WCA with similar affinity to the wild - type complex , demonstrating that the decreased activity of these mutants is not due to reduced NPF binding . A recent study probed confor - mational states of the human Arp2 / 3 complex using fluores - cence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) between fluorophores attached to different subunits of the complex ( Goley et al . , 2004 ) . Using increase in FRET to monitor WCA binding , it was demonstrated that the arp2 - D11A and arp3 - D11A mutants reduce the ability of WCA to induce conformational changes in the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Goley et al . , 2004 ) . Previous studies using mutations in WCA also suggested the existence of distinct WCA - binding and WCA - activation steps during Arp2 / 3 acti - vation ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ; Panchal et al . , 2003 ) . These re - sults support a model in which NPF - mediated Arp2 / 3 activa - tion requires ATP bound to Arp2 and Arp3 . Interestingly , the arp3 - D11A mutant , which was ex - pected to bind ATP in our nucleation assays , had a similar nu - cleation defect to the arp3 - G302Y mutant . This result sug - gested that the arp3 - D11A mutation caused structural changes in the Arp2 / 3 complex even when nucleotide was bound to Arp3 . Consistent with this interpretation , both the arp3 - D11A and arp3 - G302Y mutants prevented conformational changes in human Arp2 / 3 complex that occur upon Arp3 nucleotide bind - ing as assessed by FRET ( Goley et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , the arp3 - D11A mutant appears to uncouple conformational changes in the Arp2 / 3 complex from Arp3 nucleotide binding , mimicking the nucleotide - free arp3 - G302Y mutant . The similarity of the in vivo and in vitro phenotypes of the arp3 - D11A and arp3 - G302Y mutants suggests that defects in these mutants are spe - cifically related to Arp3 nucleotide binding . In addition , the dramatic endocytic phenotypes seen in arp3 - D11A and arp3 - G302Y demonstrate the importance of this conformational change to Arp2 / 3 function in vivo . Mechanism of Arp2 / 3 complex activation Using genetic crosses of our Arp2 and Arp3 mutants , we found that arp2 - Y306A and arp3 - F306A are suppressors of Arp2 / 3 complex defects . Interestingly , Arp2 / 3 complex purified from arp2 - Y306A , but not from arp3 - F306A , increased the nucle - ation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex with and without Las17 . This difference in activity was also seen in vivo , as arp2 - Y306A , but not arp3 - F306A , was able to suppress las17 - 11 , identifying a possible functional difference between Arp2 and Arp3 . Because the NBP is critical for regulating actin structure , Figure 8 . Model for nucleotide’s role in Arp2 / 3 complex function . ( A ) Proposed relative contributions of Arp2 and Arp3 nucleotide binding to actin filament nucleation and a yet to be determined structural activity . ( B ) Proposed steps in an endocytic pathway ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ; Kak - sonen et al . , 2003 ) affected by Arp2 and Arp3 nucleotide - binding mutants . Both Arp2 and Arp3 mutants affect the initiation and the rate of actin as - sembly at endocytic sites ( i ) , but Arp3 mutants more dramatically inhibit internalization of endocytic proteins as a consequence of defects in actin network structure and integrity ( ii ) . JCB • VOLUME 168 • NUMBER 2 • 2005 326 and because changes in the Arp2 region were visible in elec - tron microscopy reconstructions of wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex upon activation , we speculated that the arp2 - Y306A mutant causes a conformational change that increases activities of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Because arp2 - Y306A Arp2 / 3 complex exhibited similar nucleation activity to wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex activated by Las17 WCA , we examined the conformation of this mutant by comparing its structure to both inactive and WCA - bound wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex . Indeed , in three - dimensional reconstruc - tions , arp2 - Y306A Arp2 / 3 complex resembled wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex activated by Las17 WCA , showing a similar difference in the region corresponding to Arp2 . Previous evidence demon - strating that NPFs enhance Arp2 nucleotide binding support a conformational change in Arp2 upon NPF binding ( Le Clainche et al . , 2001 ) . Because it has been proposed that the Arp2 / 3 com - plex must undergo a large conformational change to bring Arp2 and Arp3 together to form a template dimer ( Robinson et al . , 2001 ; Volkmann et al . , 2001 ) , we suggest that a conformational change in Arp2 is a critical step in this process . It was surprising that a mutant that lowers affinity for ATP results in Arp2 / 3 activation . However , this lower affinity might indicate greater conformational flexibility of the NBP , allowing Arp2 to adopt an active conformation in the absence of an NPF . Interestingly , changing F306 in yeast actin to tyrosine increased the specificity of yeast actin for ATP versus GTP ( Wen et al . , 2002 ) , possibly indicating a more compact conformation . We also found that in addition to the arp2 - Y306A mutant , the arp2 - D157E mutant also suppressed arp3 mutants . In actin , this mu - tation has been shown to increase the nucleotide exchange rate ( Wolven et al . , 2000 ) , suggesting a more open conformation for the NBP . We speculate that the conformational changes ob - served in the arp2 - Y306A Arp2 / 3 complex result from greater conformational flexibility of the Arp2 NBP . Function of Arp2 and Arp3 nucleotide binding during endocytosis : general biological implications Analysis of actin organization and endocytosis in arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y demonstrated an important functional dif - ference between nucleotide binding by Arp2 versus Arp3 in vivo . The arp3 - G302Y mutant caused severe endocytic defects , whereas arp2 - G302Y showed only slight defects . However , the in vitro nucleation activities of these two mutants were indis - tinguishable . Importantly , the arp3 - G302Y mutant assembled actin filaments at endocytic sites as well as arp2 - G302Y , indi - cating that nucleation of actin filaments alone is not sufficient to drive endocytic internalization . We speculate that the struc - ture or integrity of the cortical actin network at endocytic sites is disrupted in Arp3 mutants . How might Arp3 contribute to actin cortical patch integ - rity and function ? Because Arp3 nucleotide binding influences the conformation of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Goley et al . , 2004 ) , Arp3 mutants are likely to affect multiple interactions of the Arp2 / 3 complex , possibly with one or several of the four known yeast NPFs , Las17 , Myo3 / 5 , Pan1 , and Abp1 . Interestingly , Myo5 appears in patches immediately preceding internalization , suggesting that its interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex plays an important role in vesicle formation ( Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ) . Although wild - type , arp2 - G302Y , and arp3 - G302Y Arp2 / 3 complexes bound Las17 WCA with similar affinity , conforma - tional changes upon actin filament binding and Arp2 ATP hydrolysis might alter interactions with NPFs subsequent to branch formation ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ; Volkmann et al . , 2001 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2003 ; Dayel and Mullins , 2004 ) . Con - nections between NPFs and the Arp2 / 3 complex in Y - branches might anchor branched actin filaments to the plasma membrane allowing forces to be applied for endocytic internalization . In addition , interactions with NPFs could be important for main - taining branched actin filament networks , such as those recently observed in actin structures isolated from yeast ( Young et al . , 2004 ) . The phenotype of arp3 - G302Y sla2 (cid:1) actin tails , in which clumps of actin appeared to separate from the plasma mem - brane , supports a defect in the integrity of plasma membrane at - tachment , actin network integrity , or both . Discontinuous actin comet tails have also been observed for NPF mutant “hopping” Listeria in vivo , and using a reconstituted motility system in vitro , although the molecular basis for this phenomenon is not understood ( Lasa et al . , 1997 ; Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ) . Further analysis of the molecular interactions of Arp2 and Arp3 mutants is required to determine the mechanism by which Arp3 mutants affect the functionality of actin patches . Because the arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y mutants af - fected in vitro nucleation activity indistinguishably , the simi - larities between these mutants provided insight into the func - tion of Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation . Both mutants exhibited a considerable delay in the onset of actin polymerization at en - docytic sites . This delay could have resulted from a lower nu - cleation rate or a delay in the recruitment of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex to endocytic sites . In addition , we cannot rule out the possibility of Arp2 / 3 - independent actin polymerization at these sites . Interestingly , once initiated , the rate of actin assembly at endocytic sites in arp2 - G302Y and arp3 - G302Y mutants was only slightly lower in otherwise normal cells or in sla2 (cid:1) cells . This observation was similar to the moderate decrease in motil - ity rates for Listeria ActA mutants that significantly decreased in vitro nucleation activity ( Skoble et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore , Arp2 / 3 nucleation activity in these contexts appears more im - portant for initiating actin polymerization than for sustaining it . In summary , we found that analysis of the yeast endocytic pathway provided a sensitive assay for distinguishing functions of the Arp2 / 3 complex . The similarity of the effects of our NBP mutants of the yeast Arp2 / 3 complex to the analogous mutants made in the human Arp2 and Arp3 ( Goley et al . , 2004 ) , and sim - ilarity in the recruitment of Arp2 / 3 complex to endocytic sites in yeast and mammalian cells ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Merrifield et al . , 2004 ) , suggest that our findings are directly applicable to the function of the Arp2 / 3 complex in multicellular eukaryotes .

GENETIC DISSECTION OF ATP BINDING BY ARP2 / 3 COMPLEX • MARTIN ET AL . 327 Construction of mutant and tagged strains An ARP2 : : URA3 integration construct obtained from a previous study ( Madania et al . , 1999 ) , pIMW18 - U , and an ARP3 : : LEU2 integration con - struct , pDD1698 , were mutagenized using QuikChange XL site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) . Mutants were integrated into DDY2918 and DDY2919 as described previously ( Wertman et al . , 1992 ) . Integration of the correct allele was confirmed by change in restriction site or sequenc - ing . ARC18 containing a COOH - terminal HA tag with a TEV protease site was generated using pBG265 ( a gift from B . Goode , Brandeis University , Waltham , MA ) and was integrated into the endogenous locus . Protein purification Arp2 / 3 complex was purified using an HA - tagged Arc18 subunit and was stored in HEKG 5 ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM KCl , 5 % glycerol ) buffer . Full - length Las17 was purified as described previously ( Rodal et al . , 2003 ) . GST - tagged Las17WCA was purified from bacteria using pDD1122 . Details of these purifications and actin purification proce - dures are provided in the supplemental materials . ATP binding assays ATP cross - linking was performed using 5 (cid:4) M ATP supplemented with 100 (cid:4) Ci (cid:3) - [ 32 P ] ATP . Purified Arp2 / 3 complex ( 0 . 43 (cid:4) M ) with or without WCA ( 10 (cid:4) M ) in KMEI ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imida - zole , pH 7 . 0 ) was equilibrated with ATP and irradiated at a 1 - cm distance with 254 nm UV light for 5 min using a hand - held Mineralight lamp . Sam - ples were subjected to SDS - PAGE and visualized / quantified using film or a Typhoon 9400 Phosphorimager ( Molecular Dynamics ) . Etheno - ATP bind - ing was measured at 18 (cid:5) C using excitation and emission wavelengths of 350 and 410 nm , respectively . Increasing amounts of etheno - ATP were added to 0 . 6 (cid:4) M Arp2 / 3 complex in KMEI (cid:2) 0 . 2 M acrylamide , and the background fluorescence of unbound etheno - ATP was subtracted , as de - scribed previously ( Dayel et al . , 2001 ) . K d values were calculated by fit - ting the data to a one - site binding equation using GraphPad Prism ( Graph - Pad Software , Inc . ) . Microscopy Phalloidin staining , immunofluorescence , and LY uptake were per - formed as described previously ( Belmont and Drubin , 1998 ) . For live cell imaging , log phase cells grown at 25 (cid:5) C were adhered to the sur - face of a Con A – coated coverslip , inverted onto a glass slide , and sealed with vacuum grease ( Dow Corning ) . All imaging was done at RT in synthetic media . Single fluorophore images ( Abp1 - GFP , Sla1 - GFP , and rhodamine phalloidin ) were obtained using a microscope ( model TE300 ; Nikon ) , 100 (cid:7) / NA 1 . 4 objective , and an Orca - 100 Camera ( Hamamatsu ) controlled by Image Pro Plus software ( Phase 3 Imaging ) . Dual fluorophore images ( Abp1 - GFP / Sla1 - CFP ) were obtained using a microscope ( model IX81 ; Olympus ) , 100 (cid:7) / NA 1 . 4 objective , and an Orca - ER Camera ( Hamamatsu ) , controlled by Slidebook 4 software ( In - telligent Imaging Innovations , Inc . ) . Dual fluorophore movies were ob - tained using a CFP - YFP filter set ( JP4 , Chroma ) and motorized excitation and emission filter wheels ( Sutter Instruments ) . Actin comet tails were ob - served using a confocal microscope ( model 510 ; Carl Zeiss MicroImag - ing , Inc . ) with a 63 (cid:7) / NA 1 . 4 objective . Photobleaching was per - formed by scanning a small region three times at full laser intensity at 488 nm , followed by continued image acquisition at low laser intensity . Images used to track individual Abp1 patches were smoothed by 3 (cid:7) 3 pixel averaging and then thresholded with an adaptive thresholding al - gorithm , which takes into account the local intensity level . Patch posi - tions were determined by calculating the center of fluorescence intensity for each patch . The patch positions of each frame were then connected to trace patch trajectories . Patch intensity represents the sum of the in - tensity of each pixel making up an individual Abp1 patch . Custom - made software was used for all patch tracking calculations . Processing of individual images and movies was performed using Image J software ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . Antibodies Arp2 and Arp3 were detected by immunoblotting using antibodies sc - 11968 and sc - 11973 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) . Anti - HA 12CA5 ( Roche ) was used for immunofluorescence with Arc18 - HA . Nucleation , branching , and WCA binding assays Actin assembly reactions were performed using 2 (cid:4) M actin ( 5 % pyrene la - beled ) as described previously ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ) . Barbed end concen - trations were calculated from the rate of actin assembly at 50 % polymeriza - tion using a rate constant of 11 . 6 (cid:4) M (cid:9) 1 s (cid:9) 1 ( Higgs et al . , 1999 ) . Branched filaments were observed by stabilizing actin filaments after polymerization was complete with equimolar rhodamine phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) and were processed for imaging as described previously ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ) . Branching was quantified by first calculating total filament length us - ing Fovea Pro 3 . 0 ( Reindeer Graphics , Inc . ) for Adobe Photoshop 7 . 0 ( Adobe Systems , Inc . ) , and then counting branches manually . More than 8 , 000 or 13 , 000 (cid:4) m of filaments were analyzed for wild - type or Arp2 / 3 mutants , respectively . WCA binding was measured using glutathione beads ( Sigma - Aldrich ) coated with GST - WCA . Binding was performed at RT for 30 min in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT ) supplemented with 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 5 mM ATP . Amounts of bound Arp3 were quantified by immunoblotting using a Typhoon 9400 Phosphorimager ( Molecular Dynamics ) and K d values were calculated using GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software , Inc . ) . Electron microscopy 50 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ( wild - type or arp2 - Y306A mutant ) was diluted in F buffer ( 2 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 0 . 02 % azide ) , applied to a carbon coated EM grid and stained with 2 % uranyl acetate . 500 nM Las17 WCA was mixed with the wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex for generating the acti - vated Arp2 / 3 samples . Images were obtained under low - dose conditions using a Tecnai 12 microscope ( FEI electron optics ) equipped with a Lab6 filament at 120 kV at a nominal magnification of 67 , 000 (cid:7) and at (cid:1) 1 - (cid:4) m defocus . The micrographs were digitized on a SCAI scanner ( Z / I Imaging ) at 7 - (cid:4) m raster and compressed to a final pixel size of 0 . 6 nm . Image processing Interactive selection from 16 , 17 , and 30 micrographs yielded 2 , 774 , 2 , 654 , and 2 , 330 particles from nonactivated wild - type Arp2 / 3 , nonacti - vated arp2 - Y306A mutant , and wild - type yeast Arp2 / 3 with WCA , re - spectively . The particles were processed and analyzed using the EMAN ( Ludtke et al . , 1999 ) and CoAn ( Volkmann and Hanein , 1999 ; Volkmann and Hanein , 2003 ) software packages . A correction for the contrast trans - fer function was applied for all images . Particles were first sorted into 89 classes according to their mutual similarity without the use of an external reference . Subsets of these views were used to generate initial references using a Fourier - based common - line approach . The initial models were iter - atively refined against the data . Convergence was achieved after 7 – 10 it - erations . In addition to these reference - free models , a density map calcu - lated from the bovine Arp2 / 3 crystal structure was used for separate refinements , which converged to the same reconstructions as the data - based models . To ensure the model independence of the differences be - tween activated and nonactivated complex , the final reconstruction of the activated complex was used as a starting model with the nonactivated data and vice versa . In both cases , the distinct features of the reconstruc - tions were recovered after a few rounds of refinement . A similar calcula - tion was performed with the nonactivated and the mutant complex , also with the result that the characteristic features were recovered after a few it - erations . The crystal structure of the nonactivated bovine Arp2 / 3 complex was docked into each of the reconstructions using CoAn . The correlation between the docked structure and the reconstructions was between 84 and 85 % at 2 . 5 - nm resolution .
