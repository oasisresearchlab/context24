Here we show that application of a selective Rho - associated kinase ( ROCK ) inhibitor 1 , 2 , Y - 27632 , to hES cells markedly diminishes dissociation - induced apoptosis , increases cloning efﬁciency ( from B 1 % to B 27 % ) and facilitates subcloning after gene transfer . Furthermore , dissociated hES cells treated with Y - 27632 are protected from apoptosis even in serum - free suspension ( SFEB ) culture 3 and form ﬂoating aggregates . We demonstrate that the protective ability of Y - 27632 enables SFEB - cultured hES cells to survive and differentiate into Bf1 + cortical and basal telencephalic progenitors , as do SFEB - cultured mouse ES cells . Differentiated cells produced from hES cells may be useful for treating degenerative diseases whose symptoms are caused by loss of a few particular cell types . With regard to neurological therapeutic research , speciﬁc types of neurons have been generated from mouse ES ( mES ) cells 3 – 7 , and similar selective differentiation methods have been applied to hES cells 8 – 12 . However , hES cells have been technically much harder to culture than mES cells , showing problematic proper - ties such as slow growth and insensitivity to leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) 13 , 14 . In addition , hES cells are vulnerable to apoptosis upon cellular detachment and dissociation . They undergo massive cell death particularly after complete dissociation , and the cloning efﬁciency of dissociated hES cells is generally r 1 % 13 – 16 . Thus , hES cells are difﬁcult , if not impossible , to use in dissociation culture , which is important for such procedures as clonal isolation following gene transfer 17 and differentiation induction . In an effort to circumvent the problem of apoptosis ( or anoikis 18 ) in hES cell culture , we examined the effects of several caspase inhibitors , growth factors , trophic factors and kinase inhibitors . Of the compounds tested , Y - 27632 , a selective inhibitor of p160 - Rho - associated coiled - coil kinase ( ROCK ) 2 , 19 , was the most potent inhi - bitor of apoptosis . The chemical structure and pharmacological properties of Y - 27632 are described in ref . 1 . Although the role of ROCK in apoptosis is not well understood 19 , recent reports indicate its possible involvement in certain cases of apoptosis , including chemically induced anoikis 20 and neuronal death in the embryonic motor column 21 . After a 1 - h pretreatment with Y - 27632 ( 10 m M , a commonly used working concentration 22 ) and complete dissociation , hES cells were plated on a mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast ( MEF ) feeder layer at low density ( 500 cells / well , 96 - well plates ) in maintenance medium containing Y - 27632 . By day 6 , untreated dissociated hES cells had generated very few colonies ( Fig . 1a ) . In contrast , Y - 27632 - treated dissociated hES cells produced many large colonies , which were almost all positive for alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ; Fig . 1b ) . The cloning efﬁciency ( based on the ratio of ALP + colonies formed per initially seeded hES cells ) was 26 . 6 ± 2 . 4 % and 1 . 0 ± 0 . 4 % in the presence and absence of Y - 27632 , respectively ( Fig . 1c ) . Y - 27632 - treated hES cells grown at low density were also positive for the undifferentiated - state markers E - cadherin , Oct3 / 4 and SSEA4 ( Fig . 1d – f ) . After ﬁve low - density passages , Y - 27632 - treated hES cells retained the competence to differentiate into neural cells ( see below ) , meso - dermal cells and endodermal precursors in vitro ( Fig . 1g – k ) . Even after 30 passages with low - density plating in the presence of Y - 27632 , hES cells continued to express the undifferentiated - state makers ( E - cadherin , Oct3 / 4 and SSEA4 ; Supplementary Fig . 1a – c online ) and formed teratomas after being grafted into the testes of severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice ( SCID ; Fig . 1l – n and Supplemen - tary Fig . 1d – g ) . At 30 passages the ability of the dissociated cells to form colonies was still dependent on Y - 27632 , indicating that Y - 27632 treatment was not simply selecting altered hES cells that have irreversibly acquired autonomous proliferation ability 23 , 24 in low - density culture ( Supplementary Fig . 1h , i ) . Treatment with another selective ROCK inhibitor ( 10 m M Fasudil / HA1077 ) promoted colony formation by undifferentiated hES cells in a manner similar to that of Y - 27632 ( Supplementary Fig . 1j ) . In contrast , no substantial increase in colony formation was observed with inhibitors of unrelated kinases at various concentrations : protein kinase A ( cAMP - Rp , 1 – 100 ( m M ; KT5720 , 5 – 500 nM ) , protein Received 1 March ; accepted 10 May ; published online 27 May 2007 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / nbt1310 1 Organogenesis and Neurogenesis Group and 2 Stem Cell Biology Group , Center for Developmental Biology , RIKEN , Kobe 650 - 0047 , Japan . 3 Department of Ophthalmology , National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology , Obu 474 - 8511 , Japan . 4 Department of Neurosurgery and Department of Neurology , Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine , Kyoto 606 - 8507 , Japan . 5 Present address : Division of Biology 216 - 76 , California Institute of Technology , Pasadena , California 91125 , USA .

Y - 27632 treatment increased colony formation of dissociated hES cells when they were cultured on MEF cells but not on collagen - coated dishes ( data not shown ) . It is unlikely that the effect of Y - 27632 was mediated by the MEF cells , as cloning efﬁciency was increased even in feeder - free culture 25 using Matrigel and MEF - conditioned medium ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Next we tested the protective effect of Y - 27632 on single hES cells seeded into each well of a 96 - well plate . Treatment with Y - 27632 substantially increased ALP + colony formation ( from 1 . 3 ± 0 . 6 % to 24 . 7 ± 6 . 5 % ; Fig . 2c , d ) . Thus , Y - 27632 treatment supports the maintenance of and colony formation by hES cells grown in single - cell culture . Y - 27632 promoted colony formation by dissociated hES cells at various cell densities ( Supplementary Fig . 1k ) . Y - 27632 treatment did not enhance chromosomal anomaly after long - term culture ( Supplementary Fig . 1l ) . Y - 27632 treatment also facilitated the selective subcloning of hES cells after gene transfer . In low - density dissociation culture , hES cells transfected with the drug - selectable vector ( pCAGGS - Venus - Hygro ) formed hygromycin - resistant colonies at a reasonable frequency ( 4 . 4 ± 3 . 2 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 5 colonies / initially seeded cell , ﬁve experiments ) with Y - 27632 treatment ( Fig . 2e ; strong expression of Venus - GFP , Fig . 2f ) , but rarely without it ( o 1 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 6 ) . We next studied the effects of Y - 27632 on cell growth . Dissociated hES cells were plated on MEF cells and treated with Y - 27632 either for the ﬁrst 12 h after dissociation only ( group 1 , blue ; Fig . 2g ) or for the entire culture period continuously ( group 2 , green ) . In both groups , a large number of cells survived and grew into colonies , whereas little survival was seen in cultures of dissociated hES cells grown without Y - 27632 treatment ( no Y - 27632 , purple ) . These observations suggest that the survival - promoting effect of Y - 27632 on dissociated hES cells in adhesion culture is largely attributable to the increase in cell survival during the ﬁrst half - day of the dissociation / replating procedure . After the ﬁrst half - day of culture with Y - 27632 , no signiﬁcant difference in the number of surviving cells was observed between groups 1 and 2 for the ﬁrst 3 d ( Fig . 2g ) . Interestingly , after day 3 , the cell number in group 2 cells was slightly ( but signiﬁcantly ) larger than in group 1 ( Fig . 2g ; the population doubling time during days 2 – 6 was 49 . 0 ± 2 . 0 h and 41 . 5 ± 1 . 4 h for groups 1 and 2 , respectively ; P o 0 . 01 ) . No substantial increase in the number of apoptotic cells was found in either groups on days 3 or 5 ( in all cases , o 1 % of cells were positive for active Caspase 3 ) . More than 96 % of the hES cells in both groups were positive for the cycling population marker Ki67 on days 3 and 5 ( Fig . 2h ) .

To determine whether Y - 27632 would block apoptosis under even more severe conditions , we subjected dissociated hES cells ( 2 . 5 (cid:1) 10 5 cells / 2ml on a nonadhesive 35 - mm culture plate ) to serum - free suspension culture and evaluated apoptosis . The majority ( 80 . 1 ± 4 . 9 % , n ¼ 3 ) of untreated dissociated hES cells became terminal dUTP nick - end labeling ( TUNEL ) + on day 2 ( Fig . 3a ) . In contrast , only a small portion ( 9 . 1 ± 7 . 1 % ) of hES cells treated with Y - 27632 was TUNEL + ( Fig . 3b , c ) . In comparison , only weak protection against apoptosis was observed when the cells were treated with the potent pan - caspase inhibitor I ( Z - VAD - fmk 26 , 10 m M ) or a cocktail of neurotro - phins ( BDNF / NT - 3 / NT - 4 , 50 ng each ) 15 in this suspension culture ( TUNEL + in 50 . 0 ± 13 . 4 % and 71 . 7 ± 7 . 0 % cells , respectively ; Fig . 3c ) . Consistent with these observations , Y - 27632 treatment signiﬁcantly ( P o 0 . 01 ) increased the numbers of surviving cells on day 2 of suspension culture ( 25 . 2 ± 6 . 8 % and 11 . 2 ± 5 . 6 % with and without Y - 27632 , respectively , of the initial number of seeded hES cells ) and day 6 ( 68 ± 3 . 2 % and 7 . 7 ± 1 . 6 % with and without Y - 27632 , respectively ; P o 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 3d ) . Y - 27632 - treated hES cells formed aggregates in suspension by day 2 and continued growing thereafter ( Fig . 3e , f ) . In contrast , treatment with the pan - caspase inhibitor increased the number of surviving hES cells on day 2 , but not on day 6 ( Fig . 3d ) . Z - VAD - fmk did not substantially support cell survival or aggregate formation on day 6 even at a high dose ( 100 m M ; data not shown ) . The neurotrophin treatment induced no obvious increase in cell survival on either day ( Fig . 3d ) , or of aggregate formation on day 6 ( data not shown ) .

SFEB ( serum - free culture of embryoid body - like aggregates ) 3 is a serum - free suspension culture method for mES cells , involving dis - sociation and reaggregation , that efﬁciently induces neural differentia - tion . We next applied Y - 27632 to SFEB culture of hES cells ( Fig . 3e , f ) . Dissociated hES cells were cultured until day 24 in suspension ( 2 (cid:1) 10 5 cells / ml , 4 ml / 60 - mm dish ) using a serum - free differentiation medium to which Y - 27632 was added for the ﬁrst 6 d . To enhance neural differentiation , we added three kinds of inhibitors of anti - neuralizing signals ( Wnt , Nodal and BMP ) 3 , 27 to the culture medium ( Dkk1 , LeftyA and BMPRIA - Fc , respectively ; Supplementary Fig . 2a online ) during days 0 – 24 . Under these conditions , the hES cells grew well as ﬂoating aggregates and the majority of cells expressed neural markers 9 such as Pax6 ( Fig . 3g and Supplementary Fig . 2b ) and Nestin ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) on day 24 . In contrast , the expression of the undifferentiated - state markers Oct3 / 4 and E - cadherin gradually decrea - sed during this culture period . Thus , dissociated hES cells treated with Y - 27632 efﬁciently differentiate into neural cells when cultured under the modiﬁed SFEB culture conditions ( SFEB - h culture , hereafter ) . A unique characteristic of SFEB culture observed with mES cells is the efﬁcient differentiation of telencephalic cells ( 30 – 40 % of total cells ) 3 , 12 . Bf1 ( Foxg1 ) is an early bona - ﬁde telencephalic marker and required for telencephalic development in the embryo 3 , 28 , 29 . Therefore , we next tested whether SFEB - h culture induced the differentiation of Bf1 + cells from hES cells as SFEB culture does for mES cells . On day 24 of SFEB - h culture , hES cell aggregates were plated onto dishes coated with poly - D - lysine , laminin and ﬁbronectin and cultured until day 35 ( Fig . 3h ) . On day 35 , hES cell - derived neural cells frequently expressed Bf1 ( 32 . 9 ± 2 . 6 % , Fig . 3i ) , indicating their telencephalic differentiation . The early embryonic telencephalon is subdivided into the pallial ( Bf1 + / Pax6 + cortical anlage ) and basal ( e . g . , Nkx2 . 1 + ) regions . The majority of Bf1 + cells derived from Y - 27632 - treated hES cells coex - pressed Pax6 ( 95 . 8 ± 0 . 7 % ; Fig . 3j , k ) , whereas Nkx2 . 1 was detected in only a few Bf1 + cells ( 1 % or less ; Fig . 3j , l ) . Consistent with a previous report on mES cells 3 , Shh treatment ( 30 nM ; days 15 – 35 ) decreased the Pax6 + population ( 23 . 2 ± 5 . 3 % ; Fig . 3j , m ) and increased the proportion of Nkx2 . 1 + cells among the Bf1 + cells ( 41 . 5 ± 14 . 5 % ; Fig . 3j , n ) . Thus , using Y - 27632 treatment , hES cells , just like mES cells , generate cells with pallial and basal telencephalic characteristics in this hSFEB culture . In summary , the use of the ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 enables hES cells to grow and differentiate as mES cells do under unfavorable Control Day 6 Day 6 Y - 27632 C on t r o l B D N F / N T - 3 / N T - 4 Y - 27632 C a s pa s e i nh i b i t o r T UN E L po s i t i v e c e ll s ( % ) 100 75 50 25 0 6 C e ll nu m be r ( × 10 5 c e ll s pe r 35 - mm d i s h ) Y - 27632 Caspase inhibitor Control BDNF / NT - 3 / NT - 4 Days after differentiation 2 2 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 4 E - CadOct3 / 4 Pax6 Days after differentiation 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 P e r c en t age ( po s i t i v e c e ll s / t o t a l c e ll s ) 0 25 50 75 100 Bf1 TuJ DAPI C on t r o l S hh 30 n M Pax6 Bf1 Nkx2 . 1 Bf1 Day : 0 6 15 24 35 Neural precursors Floating culture of ES cell aggregates Adherent culture LeftyA , Dkk1 , BMPRIA - Fc Pax6 Nkx2 . 1 Control Shh 0 100 75 50 25 P o s i t i v e c e ll s / B f 1 + c e ll s ( % ) 1 2 3 4 Y - 27632 Undifferentiated hES cells Telencephalic precursors * * * * * * * * * * * * C oun t s TUNEL - FITC TUNEL + Y - 27632 C oun t s TUNEL - FITC TUNEL + Control 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 20 30 40 0 50 10 20 30 40 0 Pax6 Bf1 Nkx2 . 1 Bf1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 a f g h i n m l k j b c d e Figure 3 Y - 27632 prevents apoptosis and promotes survival of dissociated hES cells ( KhES - 1 ) in suspension culture .

The improve - ment in cloning efﬁciency conferred by Y - 27632 may be particularly advantageous for isolating relatively rare clones ( e . g . , those for homologous recombination ) and also for recloning hES cells to obtain a uniform cell quality . So far , we have not observed obvious adverse effects of continuous Y - 27632 treatment on pluripotency ( Fig . 1l – n and Supplementary Fig . 1a – g ) or chromosomal stability ( Supple - mentary Fig . 1l ) in maintenance culture even after a substantial number of passages ( although more extensive future studies would be beneﬁcial ) . ROCK inhibitors such as Y - 27632 and Fasudil , are already used clinically in cardiovascular therapies 2 , suggesting that they are safe for use with hES cells . The mechanism of Y - 27632’s action in blocking apoptosis is an intriguing question that awaits future investigation . Given that Y - 27632 and another ROCK inhibitor ( Fasudil ) , but not inhibitors of other kinases , had similar protective effects at commonly used concentrations 1 , 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 1j ) , ROCK is a reasonable candidate target of the antiapoptotic activity of Y - 27632 . The upstream activation mechanism of ROCK is complex and involves both Rho - independent and dependent pathways ( e . g . , ROCK is also activated by Caspase - 3 cleavage 19 ) . Future studies of the mode of action of Y - 27632 may shed new light on why hES cells , unlike mES cells , are so prone to die upon dissociation . METHODS Maintenance culture of hES cells . The hES cells ( KhES - 1 , 2 and 3 ) were used following the hES cell research guidelines of the Japanese government . Undifferentiated hES cells were maintained as described previously 12 , 30 . Cells were cultured on a feeder layer of MEF cells ( Invitrogen ; inactivated with 10 m g / ml mitomycin C and seeded at 1 . 5 (cid:1) 10 5 per 10 - cm plate ) in DMEM / F12 ( Sigma ) supplemented with 20 % ( vol / vol ) Knockout Serum Replacement ( KSR , Invitrogen ) , 2 mM glutamine , 0 . 1 mM nonessential amino acids ( Invitrogen ) , 5 ng / ml recombinant human bFGF ( Upstate ) and 0 . 1 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ( 2 - ME ) under 2 % CO 2 . For passaging , hES cell colonies were detached and recovered en bloc from the feeder layer by treating them with 0 . 25 % trypsin and 0 . 1 mg / ml collagenase IV in PBS containing 20 % KSR and 1 mM CaCl 2 at 37 1 C for 7 min , followed by tapping the cultures and ﬂushing them with a pipette . Two volumes of culture medium were added , and the detached ES cell clumps were broken into smaller pieces ( 10 – 20 cells ) by gently pipetting them several times . The passages were done at a 1 : 4 split ratio . For storage , the ES cell colonies were recovered en bloc ( without further dissocia - tion ) from a 6 - cm culture dish , suspended in 1 ml of ice - cold culture medium supplemented with 2 M DMSO , 1 M acetamide and 3 M polypropylene glycol , and quickly frozen in a 2 - ml cryogenic tube ( BD Labware ) by directly submerging the tube in liquid N 2 . The day on which ES cells were seeded to start dissociation culture was deﬁned as day 0 . ROCK inhibitor treatment and transfection . First , hES cells were detached from the feeder layer and partially dissociated as described for the maintenance passage procedure . Next , contaminating MEF cells were removed by incubating the cell suspension on a gelatin - coated plate at 37 1 C for 2 h in the maintenance culture medium ( in this procedure , MEF cells adhere to the dish bottom , but the ES cells do not 12 ) . The hES cell clumps were recovered from the suspension by centrifugation , washed with PBS , incubated in 0 . 25 % ( wt / vol ) trypsin - EDTA ( Invitrogen ) at 37 1 C for 5 min , dissociated into single cells by pipetting and then passed through Cell Strainer ( BD Falcon ) . The dissociated cells were seeded onto an MEF feeder layer in ﬂat - bottomed 96 - well plates at low density ( 500 cells / well , 0 . 32 cm 2 ; three wells for one condition ) or at clonal density ( one cell / well ) . For ROCK inhibitor treatment , Y - 27632 ( Calbiochem ; water soluble ) was added to culture medium at 10 m M 1 h before detaching the cells from the feeder layer and also upon seeding the cells onto a new MEF layer . A single half - day treatment of Y - 27632 was sufﬁcient for enhanced survival of dissociated hES cells in low - density adhesion culture on MEF cells . In contrast , suspension culture of hES cells required Y - 27632 treatment for the ﬁrst 4 – 6 d to obtain the maximal effect ( Y - 27632 treatment for the ﬁrst 2 d only is less effective in promoting cell survival on day 6 and thereafter ) . Another ROCK inhibitor , Fasudil ( HA1077 ; Calbiochem ) , also promoted colony formation by dissociated hES cells in low - density culture to a similar extent as Y - 27632 . We mainly used Y - 27632 in this study because of its high speciﬁcity to ROCK 1 . Although the KhES - 1 line was mainly used in this study , Y - 27632 treatment also had similar promoting effects on the survival of three independent hES cell lines ( KhES - 1 , 2 and 3 ) 30 in both maintenance and differentiation cultures with dissociated cells . The cloning efﬁciencies of KhES - 1 are shown in Figure 1 ; those of KhES - 2 were 18 . 8 ± 4 . 4 % and 0 . 4 ± 0 . 2 % and those of KhES - 3 were 20 . 4 ± 2 . 6 % and 4 . 1 ± 1 . 5 % , with and without Y - 27632 , respectively . With respect to the cost , the use of the ROCK inhibitors at the indicated concentrations is comparable to or less expensive than the use of LIF at the working concentration for mES cell culture ( 1 , 000 U / ml ) . Furthermore , Y - 27632 is useful in even wider applications including the feeder - dependent differentiation 12 of dissociated hES cells ( unpublished observations ) . Transfection of hES cells with a drug - selectable plasmid , pCAGGS - Venus - Hygro , ( Venus - GFP and Hygro are driven by the CAG and GK promoters , respectively ) was performed with the ExGen 500 system ( Fermentas ) as described 17 ( Lipofectamine 2000 , Invitrogen , also worked ) . The following day , after pretreatment with Y - 27632 , cells were dissociated and replated onto MEF cells ( 10 - cm dish ) at various densities as described above . One day after replating , hygromycin ( ﬁnal concentration 50 m g / ml ) was added to the culture medium . Culture on Matrigel substrate ( BD Biosciences ) in MEF - conditioned medium was done as described previously 25 . TUNEL assay and FACS analyses . Dissociated hES cells ( 2 . 5 (cid:1) 10 5 cells ) prepared as above were seeded onto a 35 - mm nonadhesive bacterial - grade dish , and cultured in DMEM / F12 supplemented with 20 % KSR , 2 mM glutamine , 0 . 1 mM nonessential amino acids and 0 . 1 mM 2 - ME . After 2 d of culture , the cells were dissociated to single cells by trypsin digestion , ﬁxed in 4 % ( wt / vol ) paraformaldehyde , and subjected to TUNEL assay using the MEBSTAIN Apoptosis Kit Direct ( MBL ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Flow cytometrical analysis of TUNEL + cells was performed using BD ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) Aria as described 3 . Z - VAD - fmk and the neuro - trophins were purchased from Calbiochem and R & D , respectively . Flow - cytometrical proﬁling of DNA content with7 - AAD ( 7 - amino - actinomycin D ; BD Bioscience ) staining was analyzed using BD FACSCanto and FACSDiva . BrdU uptake ( 1 h ) was analyzed using the FITC BrdU Flow Kit ( BD Pharmin - gen ) . Before the single - cell dissociation for ﬂow - cytometric analysis , hES cell colonies were detached en bloc from feeder cells , and contaminating MEF cells were removed by incubating on a plastic dish in culture medium for 2 h . SFEB culture with Y - 27632 . SFEB culture was carried out as described previously 3 with a minor modiﬁcation . Dissociated hES cells ( prepared as above ; 2 (cid:1) 10 5 cells / ml ) were seeded onto a nonadhesive bacterial - grade dish and cultured in DMEM / F12 supplemented with 20 % KSR , 2 mM glutamine , 0 . 1 mM nonessential amino acids , 0 . 1 mM 2 - ME , 100 U / ml penicillin and 100 m g / ml streptomycin . Y - 27632 was added to the culture medium at 10 m M for the ﬁrst 6 d ( in addition to the 1 - h pretreatment ) in this study , although Y - 27632 did not interfere with neural differentiation even when it was added continuously during days 0 – 24 ( data not shown ) . The medium was changed every other day . Dkk1 ( 500 ng / ml ) , LeftyA ( 5 m g / ml ) , and soluble BMPRIA - Fc ( 1 . 5 m g / ml ; all from R & D ) were added to the culture from day 0 to day 24 . For long - term culture to induce telencephalic differentiation , ﬂoating SFEB aggre - gates were replated on day 25 onto a culture slide ( 8 - well CultureSlide , BD ) that was precoated with poly - D - lysine , laminin and ﬁbronectin , and cultured until day 35 in Neurobasal + B27 supplement ( without vitamin A ) + 2 mM L - glutamine . For ventralization experiments , Shh ( 30 nM , R & D ) was added during days 24 – 35 . Medium was changed every third day for the ﬁrst 6 d and every other day for the rest of the differentiation culture . Although neural differentiation ( Nestin + , Pax6 + ) could be also induced by suspension culture of large hES cell clumps ( detached en bloc from the feeder layer ) in the same differentiation culture medium without Y - 27632 , these aggregates survived only at a low frequency ( o 3 % ) and , in these few aggregates , the number of Bf1 + cells was generally low ( o 10 % of surviving cells on day 35 ) . Statistical analysis . The statistical signiﬁcance ( P values ) in mean values of two - sample comparison was determined with Student’s t - test ( Microsoft NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY VOLUME 25 NUMBER 6 JUNE 2007 685 L E T T E R S © 2007 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e b i o t ec hno l og y Excel ) . The statistical signiﬁcance in the comparison of multiple sample sets versus control ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) was analyzed with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test using the Instat program ( GraphPad ) . The statistical signiﬁcance in mean values among multiple sample groups was examined with Bonferroni’s ( Fig . 3c ) and Tukey - Kramer’s ( Supplementary Fig . 1k ) multiple comparisons test after one - way ANOVA test , or with two - way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post - hoc test ( Figs . 2g and 3d ) using the Prism 4 program ( GraphPad ) . Values shown on graphs represent the mean ± s . d . Alkaline phosphatase staining , immunostaining and chromosomal analysis . Alkaline phosphatase staining was performed using the Leukocyte Alkaline Phosphatase Kit ( Sigma ) . Immunostaining was performed as described pre - viously 3 . Brieﬂy , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde at 4 1 C for 15 min , and the staining was visualized using secondary antibodies conjugated with FITC , cy3 or cy5 . Floating aggregates were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , embedded in OCT , and sectioned at 10 m m on a cryostat . For immunostaining cells in large colonies in adhesion culture , confocal microscopy ( Zeiss LSM 510 ) was used to observe the cells inside the colony with good resolution . The total number of cells was counted by staining the nuclei with DAPI . For statistical analyses , 50 – 100 colonies were examined in each experiment . Experiments were performed at least three times . Commercial antibodies used for immunostaining were as follows : BD Bioscience Pharmingen ( Oct - 3 / mouse monoclonal / 611202 / 1 : 200 ) , Covance ( human Nestin / rabbit polyclonal / PRB - 570C / 1 : 1 , 000 , neuronal class III b - tubulin / rabbit polyclonal / PRB - 435P / 1 : 600 , neuronal class III b - tubulin / mouse monoclonal / MMS - 435P / 1 : 300 ) , R & D systems ( Pax6 / mouse monoclonal / MAB1260 / 1 : 500 ; Hnf3 b / goat polyclonal / AF2400 ; Brachyury / goat polyclonal / AF2085 ) , DAKO ( SMA / mouse monoclonal / M0851 ) , Zymed ( Nkx2 . 1 / mouse monoclonal / 18 - 0221 / 1 : 100 ) , Developmental Studies Hybrido - ma Bank ( SSEA - 4 / mouse monoclonal / MC - 813 - 70 / 1 : 200 ) and TAKARA ( E - cadherin / rat monoclonal / M108 / 1 : 50 ) . The staining for Bf1 was performed using rabbit - raised antibodies as described previously 3 . Chromosomal G - band analysis was done as described previously 30 by pretreating hES cells with 0 . 06 m g / ml colecemid for 4 h and incubating them in 0 . 075 M KCl for 10 min . Teratoma formation , in vitro mesoendodermal induction and RT - PCR . Teratoma formation experiments were done by injecting B 5 (cid:1) 10 5 hES cells ( maintained in the presence of Y - 27632 and detached from the feeder layer as cell clumps in the presence of Y - 27632 ) subcapsularly into the testes of 7 - week - old SCID mice using a Hamilton syringe . For in vitro differentiation into mesodermal progenitors ( Fig . 1g , i ) , hES cells were plated on a plastic dish coated with collagen IV , and cultured in DMEM / F12 supplemented with 10 % FCS , 2 mM glutamine , 0 . 1 mM nonessential amino acids and 0 . 1 mM 2 - ME under 2 % CO 2 for 6 d . On day 6 , 15 – 25 % of the cells were positive for Brachyury staining . For endodermal progenitors ( Fig . 1h , k ) , hES cells were cultured with 1 % FCS and 100 ng / ml activin ( the rest of the ingredients were the same as in Fig . 1g ) on a collagen IV - coated dish for 6 d . Hnf3 b expression was found in B 10 % of cells cultured with 10 % FCS on day 6 . RT - PCR was performed using the following primers : glyceldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydro - genase ( GAPDH ) ( forward , 5 ¢ - GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT - 3 ¢ ; reverse , 5 - TGTGGTCATGAGTCCTTCCA - 3 ¢ ; 513 - bp product ) , T ( brachyury ) ( forward , 5 ¢ - GCAAAAGCTTTCCTTGATGC - 3 ¢ ; reverse , 5 ¢ - ATGAGGATTTGCAGGTG GAC - 3 ¢ ; 144 - bp product ) , Sox17 ( forward , 5 ¢ - CGCACGGAATTTGAACAG TA - 3 ¢ ; reverse , 5 ¢ - CAGTAATATACCGCGGAGCTG - 3 ¢ ; 149 - bp product ) , and Meox1 ( forward , 5 ¢ - TGAAGTGGAAGCGTGTGAAG - 3 ¢ ; reverse , 5 ¢ - GGTAG GGGGCTCAGTCCTTA - 3 ¢ ; 139 - bp product ) .
