To elucidate the roles of individual Src family members in vivo , we generated transgenic mice expressing the neuronal form of c - Src ( n - Src ) , Fyn , and their constitutively active forms in cerebellar Purkinje cells using the L7 promoter . The expression of the constitutively active n - Src retarded the postnatal development of Purkinje cells and disrupted dendritic morphogenesis , whereas the wild - type n - Src had only moderate effects . Neither wild - type nor constitutively active Fyn over - expression signiﬁcantly affected Purkinje - cell morphology . The aberrant Purkinje cells in n - Src transgenic mice retained multiple dendritic shafts extending in non - polarized directions and were located heterotopically in the molecular layer . Ultrastructural observation of the dendritic shafts revealed that the microtubules of n - Src transgenic mice were more densely and irregularly arranged , and had structural deformities . In primary culture , Purkinje cells from n - Src transgenic mice developed abnormally thick dendritic shafts and large growth - cone - like structures with poorly extended dendrites , which could be rescued by treatment with a selective inhibitor of Src family kinases , PP2 . These results suggest that n - Src activity regulates the dendritic morphogenesis of Purkinje cells through affecting microtubule organization . # 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society .

Introduction Neural development is regulated by a variety of extracellular cues that are processed via speciﬁc receptors and downstream intracellular signaling pathways . The Src family of tyrosine kinases ( SFKs ) arenon - receptorprotein tyrosine kinases , that are abundantly expressed in the nervous system ( Maness , 1992 ) and have been implicated in diverse neural - cell signaling pathways that contribute to neurogenesis , differentiation , migration , neurite extension , and synaptic transmission ( Beggs et al . , 1994 ; Ignelzi et al . , 1994 ; Morgan et al . , 2000 ; Zhao et al . , 2003 ; Kalia et al . , 2004 ) . SFKs are membrane - localized via an amino - terminal fatty - acid modiﬁcation and functionally cooperate with variousmembranereceptors torelayextracellular signals intothe cells ( Thomas and Brugge , 1997 ) . Of the eight SFK members , c - Src , Fyn , c - Yes , Lyn , and Lck are highly expressed in the central nervoussystem and thereare neuralisoforms of c - Src ( n - Src ) and Fyn ( FynB ) ( Martinez et al . , 1987 ; Cooke and Perlmutter , 1989 ; Zhao et al . , 1991 ; Umemori et al . , 1992 ; Bare et al . , 1993 ; Chen et al . , 1996 ; Omri et al . , 1996 ) . The expression of n - Src is restricted to neuron and is temporally augmented at the onset of neural differentiation , implicating the role for n - Src in early stages of neuronal development . In contrast , Fyn is widely expressedinthenervoussystem andmaintainedatrelativelyhigh levels in mature tissues , suggesting that Fyn plays roles in maintenance and / or higher order function of the nervous system ( Sudol et al . , 1988 ; Wiestler and Walter , 1988 ) . However , despite the abundant expression of Src in developing neurons , Src - knockout mice show no overt nervous system phenotype ( Soriano et al . , 1991 ) .
