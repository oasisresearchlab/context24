P . Noguchi 3 , Keiko Hirose 2 , Yasushi Sako 1 & Taro Q . P . Uyeda 2 , 4 Mutation of the Lys - 336 residue of actin to Ile ( K336I ) or Asp ( K336E ) causes congenital myopathy . To understand the effect of this mutation on the function of actin filaments and gain insight into the mechanism of disease onset , we prepared and biochemically characterised K336I mutant actin from Dictyostelium discoideum . Subtilisin cleavage assays revealed that the structure of the DNase - I binding loop ( D - loop ) of monomeric K336I actin , which would face the adjacent actin - protomer in filaments , differed from that of wild type ( WT ) actin . Although K336I actin underwent normal salt - dependent reversible polymerisation and formed apparently normal filaments , interactions of K336I filaments with alpha - actinin , myosin II , and cofilin were disrupted . Furthermore , co - filaments of K336I and WT actins also exhibited abnormal interactions with cofilin , implying that K336I actin altered the structure of the neighbouring WT actin protomers such that interaction between cofilin and the WT actin protomers was prevented . We speculate that disruption of the interactions between co - filaments and actin - binding proteins is the primary reason why the K336I mutation induces muscle disease in a dominant fashion . Actin is involved in many crucially important cellular functions such as muscle contraction , cytokinesis , cell motility , intracellular transport , adhesion , cell signalling , endocytosis , and exocytosis 1 – 3 . To date , a number of dominant negative actin mutations have been identified from genetic screens in model organisms and genetic analyses of human diseases 4 – 11 , and some of them were biochemically characterised 12 – 14 . In general , however , purification and biochemical analyses of recombinant dominant negative actins are difficult , particularly when the mutation dominantly interferes with essential functions of actin in expression host cells 6 . To address this problem , we previously developed a fusion protein of actin and thymosin - β 15 . The thymosin - β moiety prevents recombinant mutant actin from copolymerising with endogenous actin in host cells so that the mutant actin does not exhibit toxicity . After extraction and purification of the fusion protein from host cells , recombinant mutant actin is separated from the thymosin - β moiety by chymotryptic digestion 15 . We have used this expression system to biochemically characterise several dominant negative mutant actins 16 – 18 . The Lys - 336 residue of actin is located near the ATP binding site ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) and is conserved among all known actins . It has been reported that mutation of Lys - 336 of alpha - actin to Ile or Glu in muscle cells causes congenital myopathy 8 , 9 . D’Amico et al . previously reported that dominant negative K336E actin , isolated from human muscle biopsy , impairs interactions between alpha - actinin and myosin II 19 . Their results also sug - gested that the weaker binding of K336E actin to alpha - actinin , which anchors actin filaments to the Z - line , leads to lower force generation and impaired force transmission in muscle cells , resulting in muscle disease . However , biochemical characterisation of the mutant actin was insufficient , probably due to the small amount of actin obtainable from human muscle biopsy . Using the thymosin - β expression system , we purified a Dictyostelium dis - coideum K336I mutant actin to further examine the effect of K336I mutation on the function of actin filaments at 1 Cellular Informatics Lab . , RIKEN , Wako , Saitama , 351 - 0198 , Japan . 2 Biomedical Research institute , national Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology ( AIST ) , Tsukuba , Ibaraki , 305 - 8562 , Japan . 3 national Institute of Technology , Miyakonojo College , Miyakonojo , Miyazaki , 885 - 8567 , Japan . 4 Department of Physics , Waseda University , Shinjuku , Tokyo , 169 - 8555 , Japan . 5 Present address : Advanced ict Research institute , national Institute of Information and Communications Technology ( NICT ) , Kobe , Hyogo , 651 - 2492 , Japan .

Our in vitro studies revealed that K336I actin forms apparently normal co - filaments with WT actin , but that interactions of co - filaments with alpha - actinin , cofilin , and myosin II are impaired . Most notably , K336I actin in co - filaments alters the structural properties of neighbouring WT actin protomers , and prevents them from interacting with cofilin . Results Expression and purification of recombinant K336I actin . K336I actin was expressed in Dictyostelium cells as a fusion protein with thymosin - β and a His - tag . After extraction and purification of the fusion protein , actin was separated from the thymosin - β and His - tag moieties by chymotryptic digestion , yielding a 42 - kDa actin band when subjected to SDS - PAGE ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . We further purified the recombinant K336I actin by Q - Sepharose column chromatography followed by a cycle of polymerisation and depolymerisation ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . The average yield of K336I actin was approximately 5 mg from 6 . 0 litres of culture ( 6 . 0 × 10 6 cells / litre ) , comparable to WT actin preparations . Properties of K336I mutant globular actin ( G - actin ) . We hypothesised that mutation of Lys - 336 to Ile would affect the conformation of the ATP binding site because the side chain of Lys - 336 indirectly contacts the nucleotide in the ATP binding pocket through a water molecule 20 ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . To test this , we measured the nucleotide exchange rate of K336I mutant G - actin using a fluorescent ATP analogue , ε - ATP , and compared it to that of WT G - actin ( Fig . 1A ) . The release rate of ε - ATP from K336I G - actin was lower than from WT G - actin ( Fig . 1A ) . This result suggests that conformation of the ATP binding site of K336I G - actin differs from that of WT G - actin . It is well known that the conformation of the ATP binding site influences the structure of D - loop ( residues 39 – 51 ) in subdomain 2 21 , 22 , which faces the adjacent actin subunit in filamentous actin ( F - actin ) and plays an important role in polymerisation 23 ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Previous reports showed that the cleavage rate of the D - loop by the serine protease subtilisin depends on its structure 12 , 17 , 24 . Therefore , we employed a subtilisin diges - tion assay to investigate the conformation of the D - loop of K336I G - actin . Consistent with previous reports 25 – 27 , subtilisin cleavage of G - actin , presumably between Met47 - Gly48 12 , 27 , yielded a 36 kDa fragment ( Fig . 1B , C and Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . Densitometric analysis revealed that K336I G - actin was less susceptible to subtilisin protease than WT G - actin ( Fig . 1C ) , suggesting that mutation of Lys - 336 to Ile also affects the conformation of D - loop . Polymerisation and depolymerisation of K336I actin . Because the structure of the D - loop of K336I G - actin differed from that of WT actin , we next investigated the effects of K336I mutation on polymerisation and depolymerisation . K336I actin was induced to polymerise and depolymerise by the addition of salt and Latrunculin A , respectively , and we observed changes in light scatter ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . Unexpectedly , changes in light scatter were similar between K336I and WT actin . Moreover , the critical concentration of K336I actin , estimated by the ultracentrifugation method , was 0 . 72 µ M , which was comparable to that of WT actin ( 0 . 58 µ M ) ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . These results suggest that mutation of the Lys - 336 residue does not sig - nificantly affects actin’s abilities to polymerise and depolymerise . Consistent with this , K336I actin filaments appeared normal when observed by electron microscopy ( Supplementary Fig . S6 ) and fluorescence microscopy ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . In patients with congenital myopathy who are heterozygous at the alpha - actin locus , K336I actin is likely to be present in muscle cells at the same concentration as WT actin . Thus , we next examined whether K336I actin formed co - filaments with WT actin when the two proteins were mixed in G - buffer and induced to polymerise by the addition of salt . Fluorescence microscopy of Alexa Fluor – labelled actins showed that K336I actin can form co - filaments with WT actin ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . Interactions of K336I actin filaments with alpha - actinin and myosin . A previous semi - quantitative study demonstrated that interactions of actin filaments with alpha - actinin and myosin II were significantly atten - uated by K336E mutation 19 . We examined the binding affinity of K336I actin and the actin - binding domain ( ABD ) of Dictyostelium alpha - actinin using quantitative co - sedimentation assays and found that the K336I muta - tion decreased the affinity between actin filaments and the alpha - actinin ABD . Binding affinity was decreased by 50 % for K336I homo - filaments and 16 % for K3336I / WT co - filaments as compared to WT homo - filaments ( Fig . 2 ) . We also performed in vitro motility assays to assess the interaction of K336I actin filaments with myosin . The velocities of K336I actin homo - filaments and K336I / WT co - filaments on surfaces coated with rabbit skel - etal muscle myosin II heavy meromyosin ( HMM ) were decreased by approximately 47 % and 18 % , respectively , compared to that of WT homo - filaments ( Fig . 3 ) . These results indicate that the K336I mutation significantly disturbs the interaction with myosin II as well . Interestingly , when we repeated the assay using human myosin V , motility was unaffected , suggesting that disruption of the actin – myosin interaction by the K336I mutation is myosin class - specific ( Fig . 3 ) . Effect of K336I mutation on cofilin binding . Cofilin is a major actin filament – severing protein 28 , 29 , but the dominant negative actin mutations D11Q / N and G146V prevent interaction with cofilin 5 , 17 . We exam - ined the effect of K336I mutation on cofilin binding using a co - sedimentation assay , which was performed under slightly acidic conditions to suppress actin - severing activity 30 . Although cofilin efficiently bound to 5 µ M WT homo - filaments under our experimental conditions , cofilin bound only very weakly to 5 µ M K336I homo - filaments ( Fig . 4 and Supplementary Fig . S8 ) . Interestingly , when 5 µ M WT actin was copolymerised with increasing concentrations ( 0 . 5 , 1 . 7 , and 5 . 0 µ M , resulting in the molar ratios of K336I : WT actin = 0 . 1 : 1 , 0 . 33 : 1 , and 1 : 1 , respectively , as shown in Fig . 4 ) of K336I actin , the amount of bound cofilin decreased 3 Scientific RepoRts | ( 2019 ) 9 : 5353 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 019 - 41795 - w www . nature . com / scientificreports www . nature . com / scientificreports / progressively , indicating that cofilin bound to WT protomers in the co - filaments less efficiently than to those in WT homo - filaments . The results suggest that K336I protomers in the co - filaments affect the structure of neigh - bouring WT protomers and reduce their affinity for cofilin . Recently , we reported that a cofilin – actin fusion protein is a useful tool for investigating cooperative conforma - tional changes of actin filaments 31 . By copolymerising this fusion protein with K336I actin , we were able to further investigate the effect of K336I on neighbouring actin protomers . It is known that the D - loop of actin in filaments is slowly cleaved by subtilisin , but when cofilin is bound , the cleavage reaction is significantly accelerated 24 . Consistent with our previous report 31 , in co - filaments of WT actin and cofilin – actin fusion protein , the D - loop of the fusion protein was rapidly digested by subtilisin ( Fig . 5B and Supplementary Fig . S8 ) . By contrast , when the fusion protein copolymerised with K336I actin , the cleavage rate of the D - loop in the fusion protein significantly decreased . This is consistent with the result of Fig . 4 and supports the conclusion that mutation of Lys - 336 to Ile affects the structure of neighbouring actin protomers in the filament and thereby reduces the affinity for cofilin . Pi release from K336I mutant actin . As mentioned above , cofilin does not bind K336I actin filaments well . Cofilin preferentially binds to ADP - actin protomers in filaments ; thus , this lack of binding might be due Figure 1 . Properties of purified K336I monomeric actin . ( A ) The release rate of ε - ATP from K336I and WT actin monomers was monitored by measuring the decrease in fluorescence intensity after the addition of regular ATP ( 1 mM ) to 20 µ M K336I or WT G - actin that had been incubated with ε - ATP . The dissociation rates of ε - ATP from K336I mutant actin and WT actin were 0 . 009 ± 0 . 001 s − 1 and 0 . 025 ± 0 . 005 s − 1 , respectively ( mean ± SE , N = 3 ) .

We measured the ATPase activity of actin during polymerisation and found that K336I actin homo - filaments have the ability to hydrolyse ATP and release Pi during polymerisation , and have slightly accelerated ATP hydrolysis activity compared to WT actin ( Supplementary Fig . S9 ) . This result suggests that inhibition of cofilin binding is not due to defects in ATP hydrol - ysis or Pi release . Figure 2 .

Our in vitro studies using recombinant K336I actin revealed that although K336I actin forms co - filaments with WT actin ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) , interactions of K336I / WT co - filaments with alpha - actinin ( Fig . 2 ) , myosin II ( Fig . 3 ) , and cofilin ( Fig . 4 ) were impaired . Most importantly , a structural change in K336I actin protomers affects neigh - bouring WT actin protomers in K336I / WT co - filaments ( Fig . 5 ) and allosterically reduces their affinity for cofilin ( Fig . 4 ) . The function and proper arrangement of actin filaments are critical for muscle contraction , and depend on interactions with a number of actin - binding proteins . For example , interactions of actin filaments with alpha - actinin , myosin II , and cofilin are required for achieving the assembly and maintenance of muscle fibres 33 , force - production 34 , and the turnover of sarcomeric actin 35 , respectively . Therefore , it is plausible that disruption of the interactions between these proteins and actin filaments induces muscle disease 36 – 38 . Previous molecular dynamics studies suggested that the Lys - 336 residue and several residues on the D - loop are involved in interactions with cofilin and myosin II 39 , 40 . Consistent with this , our studies showed that the K336I mutation impairs interactions with those proteins ( Figs 3 and 4 ) . However , this does not necessarily mean that the phenotype of affected muscle cells is solely caused by disruption of the binding site by substitution of the side chain of Lys - 336 . It is possible that the binding of an actin - binding protein induces a conformational change in an actin protomer and this conformational change may be propagated along the filament , recruiting additional actin - binding protein to neighbouring protomers 41 – 46 . Such cooperative binding may be important for achieving the cellular functions of actin 44 . For example , cofilin alters the twist of actin filaments , and this confor - mational change propagates to neighbouring actin protomers in the same filament 31 , 43 , 45 , 47 – 49 . This cooperative conformational change induces further binding of cofilin molecules that results in cooperative binding , and this may contribute to the severing function of cofilin 31 , 45 , 50 . Our data clearly indicated that K336I actin impairs the interaction of cofilin with WT actin protomers in K336I / WT co - filaments ( Fig . 4 ) , implying that K336I actin Figure 4 .

The amount of cofilin in each pellet was normalized to the amount in the pellet of WT homo - filaments . 6 Scientific RepoRts | ( 2019 ) 9 : 5353 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 019 - 41795 - w www . nature . com / scientificreports www . nature . com / scientificreports / protomers inhibit cofilin - induced cooperative conformational changes of the co - filaments , resulting in defective cooperative cofilin binding . Conformational freedom of the hinge region connecting the large and small domains of actin might be impor - tant for the conformational change of actin filaments and required for the binding of certain proteins 51 . We previ - ously reported that the G146V mutation , which is positioned in the hinge region ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) and is dominant lethal in yeast , also inhibits cooperative binding of cofilin 5 . Furthermore , motility and force generation of G146V actin filaments with myosin II are strongly impaired in vitro , even though motility and force generation with myosin V are normal 5 , 18 . These phenotypes of G146V actin are qualitatively very similar to those of K336I actin . Since the G146V mutation likely perturbs the structural change between the large and small domains of actin 52 , it is plausible that the interaction of G146V actin with cofilin and myosin II is impaired despite the fact that cofilin and myosin II do not interact directly with Gly - 146 . Because Lys - 336 is also in the hinge region 51 ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) and the biochemical properties of K336I actin are similar to those of G146V actin , we speculate that K336I mutation also perturbs the structural change between the large and small domains . Of particular interest is the fact that both G146V and K336I mutant actins show impaired motility with myo - sin II but not with myosin V , implying that the structural requirements of actin filaments are different for fast , non - processive myosin II and slow , processive myosin V motilities . These two mutations may impair structural requirements for myosin II through a common mechanism . Further studies are needed to understand the inhib - itory mechanism , with the ultimate goal of understanding the conformational requirements of actin for produc - tive interaction with myosin II . digested actin and / or digested cofilin - actin ( 36 kDa ) K336I WT + cofilin - actin + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + 0 4 11 20 35 reaction time ( min ) cofilin - actin ( intact , 66 kDa ) actin ( intact , 42 kDa ) B D - loop in the fusion protein A cofilin - actin fusion protein wild - type actin K336I actin cofilin moiety in the fusion protein protease accessibility subtilisin High Low cofilin - actin ( nicked ) digested cofilin - actin ( 30 kDa ) actin moiety ( wild - type ) in the fusion protein Figure 5 . Copolymerisation of cofilin – actin fusion protein with K336I actin affects cleavage of the D - loop in the fusion protein . As shown in our previous report 31 , the fusion protein polymerises and depolymerises normally in a salt - dependent manner , and the cofilin moiety in the fusion protein has a pH - sensitive depolymerisation and severing activities of actin filaments . These functional properties of the cofilin moiety are similar to that of normal cofilin . Thus , there is seems to be no steric problem between the actin and cofilin moieties in the fusion protein in terms of interaction with other actin molecules . ( A ) Schematic drawing showing the detection of structural changes of the actin moiety in the fusion protein when copolymerised with K336I actin . In a co - filament , when K336I actin protomers affect the structure of the WT actin moiety of the fusion protein , they reduce the affinity of that actin moiety for cofilin moiety , causing its D - loop to have reduced susceptibility to subtilisin cleavage . The D - loop of actin ( except for the actin moiety in the fusion protein ) is not shown . ( B ) Subtilisin digestions of K336I / cofilin – actin co - filaments or WT / cofilin – actin co - filaments . Cofilin – actin fusion protein with an intact D - loop became slightly smaller after treatment with subtilisin , presumably due to nicking in the cofilin moiety by subtilisin , as shown in our previous report 31 . Digestion of the D - loop in the cofilin – actin fusion protein yielded bands of approximately 30 and 36 kDa , and did not yield a 42 kDa band 31 . The amount of undigested D - loop of the fusion protein ( the sum of the 66 kDa band and the slightly smaller nicked band , marked by asterisks ) in the K336I / cofilin – actin co - filaments was greater than in the WT / cofilin – actin co - filaments when digested for the same length of time . Nicking of the cofilin moiety in the fusion protein was accelerated by copolymerisation with K336I actin , and was most evident after 11 minutes of subtilisin digestion . This is consistent with the results of co - sedimentation experiments ( Fig . 4 ) , and supports the model shown in ( A ) . Full - length gel image is shown in Supplementary Fig . S8 . 7 Scientific RepoRts | ( 2019 ) 9 : 5353 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 019 - 41795 - w www . nature . com / scientificreports www . nature . com / scientificreports / The side - chain of Lys - 336 indirectly contacts the nucleotide in the ATP binding pocket through a water mole - cule ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Our nucleotide exchange assay showed that the mutation of Lys - 336 to Ile increased the nucleotide - binding capability of actin ( Fig . 1A ) , which is difficult to explain by disruption of the ATP bind - ing interface . One possible explanation is that impairment of the conformational change between the large and small domains of actin by the K336I mutation indirectly affects the nucleotide - binding ability . We speculate that the abnormal conformational change induced by the mutation , rather than slower nucleotide exchange , causes impaired cellular function of K336I actin . In summary , our in vitro studies demonstrated that K336I mutant actin is able to form co - filaments with WT actin and disrupts interactions of these co - filaments with alpha - actinin , cofilin , and myosin II . K336I actin protomers in co - filaments alter the structure of neighbouring WT actin protomers and thereby allosterically and cooperatively reduce their affinity for cofilin . Methods Plasmid construction . pTIKL ART 15 contains an ART gene , which is the Dictyostelium act15 gene modified to carry four unique restriction sites ( the AR gene ) , followed by a Gly - based linker , a syn - thetic human thymosin - β gene , and a His - tag . The K336I mutation was synthesised using a PCR - based method and subcloned into pTIKL ART after confirmation by DNA sequencing . The mutated sequence is CCACCAGAACGTATTTACTCTGTCTGGA , with mutated nucleotides underlined . Dictyostelium alpha - ac - tinin ABD ( amino acids 6 – 250 ) cDNA was cloned between KpnI and PstI sites of the pCold I vector ( Takara Bio ) containing a TEV protease cleavage sequence between NdeI and KpnI sites 45 . Preparation of proteins . Recombinant WT and K336I actins were expressed and purified as described previously 16 . Briefly , Ax2 or KAx3 Dictyostelium discoideum cells were transfected by electroporation with the pTIKL - based plasmids described above and grown in HL5 medium containing 40 µ g / mL G418 . The cells were harvested , washed , resuspended , and disrupted in the extraction buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH7 . 4 , 0 . 5 M NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , 7 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 5 – 10 mM imidazole pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 , and protease inhibitors ) . After the cell lysates were centrifuged at 36 , 000 × g for 30 minutes at 4 °C , each ART in the superna - tants was enriched using a Ni 2 + - NTA affinity column ( Qiagen ) . The crude ARTs were dialysed against G - buffer ( 2 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM ATP , and 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) ) , and then digested with chymotrypsin . The digested proteins were further purified by Q - Sepharose column chromatography ( GE Healthcare ) . The purification of Dictyostelium cofilin and cofilin – actin fusion protein was performed as described pre - viously 31 . In brief , KAx3 wild type Dictyostelium cells were transfected with pTIKL cofilin – AR and grown in HL5 medium containing 40 μ g / mL G418 . After the cells were harvested and disrupted , cofilin – actin was purified from cell lysate using a Ni 2 + - NTA affinity column as described above . For further purification , the cofilin – actin solution was loaded onto an anti - FLAG M2 affinity agarose gel column ( Wako Chemicals ) . After the column was washed , cofilin – actin was eluted with 0 . 1 mg / ml FLAG peptide dissolved in buffer ( 0 . 4 M NaCl , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM ATP , and 7 mM β - mercaptoethanol ) and was dialysed against G - buffer containing 10 % sucrose . The recombinant Dictyostelium cofilin was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta cells and purified using a Ni 2 + - NTA affinity column ( Qiagen ) . Rabbit skeletal myosin II - HMM was prepared by limited digestion 53 , and recombinant truncated human myo - sin V ( myosin V - HMM ) was purified as described previously 18 . Briefly , SF9 cells were coinfected with two sep - arate viruses expressing the myosin V - HMM and calmodulin and were cultured at 28 °C . After 3 days , the cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in buffer ( 0 . 3 M KCl , 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mg / mL calmodulin , 7 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 2 mM ATP , and protease inhibitors ) . The cell lysate was ultracentrifuged , and then the resultant supernatant was loaded onto an anti - FLAG M2 affinity agarose gel column .

The recombinant alpha - actinin ABD was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta cells and purified using a Ni 2 + - NTA affinity column ( Qiagen ) . To remove the His - tag , the purified protein was treated with His - tagged TEV protease and passed through a Ni 2 + - NTA resin . Aliquots of these proteins were snap - frozen in liquid nitro - gen and stored at − 80 °C .
