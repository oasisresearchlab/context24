Beckerle In response to upstream signals , proteins in the Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASP ) family regulate actin nucleation via the Arp2 / 3 complex . Despite intensive study of the function of WASP family proteins in nucleation , it is not yet understood how their distinct structural organization contributes to actin - based motility . Herein , we analyzed the activities of WASP and Scar1 truncation derivatives by using a bead - based motility assay . The minimal region of WASP sufﬁcient to direct movement was the C - terminal WCA fragment , whereas the corresponding region of Scar1 was insufﬁcient . In addition , the proline - rich regions of WASP and Scar1 and the Ena / VASP homology 1 ( EVH1 ) domain of WASP independently enhanced motility rates . The contributions of these regions to motility could not be accounted for by their direct effects on actin nucleation with the Arp2 / 3 complex , suggesting that they stimulate motility by recruiting additional factors . We have identiﬁed proﬁlin as one such factor . WASP - and Scar1 - coated bead motility rates were signiﬁcantly reduced by depletion of proﬁlin and VASP and could be more efﬁciently rescued by a combination of VASP and wild - type proﬁlin than by VASP and a mutant proﬁlin that cannot bind proline - rich sequences . Moreover , motility of WASP WCA beads was not affected by the depletion or addback of VASP and proﬁlin . Our results suggest that recruitment of factors , including proﬁlin , by the proline - rich regions of WASP and Scar1 and the EVH1 domain of WASP stimulates cellular actin - based motility . INTRODUCTION For many cell types , the ability to move across a solid surface is fundamental to their biological function . Certain aspects of cell locomotion , such as the protrusion of the plasma membrane in lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia , are driven by the polymerization of actin ﬁlaments . To coordinate these behaviors , tight spatial and temporal control is exerted over several aspects of the polymerization cycle , including the nucleation of new actin ﬁlaments and the elongation of existing ones . Members of the Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASP ) family , including WASP , N - WASP , and at least three variants of Scar / WAVE , seem to play a central role in regulating these processes . However , speciﬁcally how these different WASP family proteins contribute to various aspects of actin - based motility is not well under - stood . WASP family proteins contain multiple regions ( Figure 1 ) , some of which bind to proteins involved in actin nucleation and elongation , and others to signaling molecules that reg - ulate these activities . A conserved carboxy - terminal segment functions to stimulate the nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Higgs et al . , 1999 ; Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Winter et al . , 1999 ) , an actin - nucleating factor in cells . This region , referred to as WCA , consists of a WASP - homology 2 domain ( W ) that binds to actin monomer ( Ma - chesky and Insall , 1998 ; Miki et al . , 1998b ) , along with a basic connector sequence ( C ) and an acidic stretch ( A ) that interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Mar - chand et al . , 2001 ) . Activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by the WCA region leads to actin nucleation and cross - linking of newly formed ﬁlaments into branched arrays ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000 ) . The activity of the WCA region of WASP family proteins is regulated by the central and amino - terminal regions . The central region consists of proline - rich sequences ( P ) that interact with the SH3 domains of adapter proteins ( Grb2 and Nck ) , kinases , phospholipase C (cid:1) , as well as WISH and IRSp53 ( Bear et al . , 2001 ; Takenawa and Miki , 2001 ) . Binding of several of these proteins , including Grb2 ( Carlier et al . , 2000 ) , Nck ( Rohatgi et al . , 2001 ) , WISH ( Fukuoka et al . , 2001 ) , and IRSp53 ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) , enhances actin nucleation by WASP family proteins and the Arp2 / 3 complex . The P region of WASP family proteins also interacts with proﬁlin ( Miki et al . , 1998b ; Suetsugu et al . , 1998 ) and VASP ( Castel - lano et al . , 2001 ; interaction only shown for WASP ) , actin - Article published online ahead of print .

DC1 Supplemental Material can be found at : binding proteins that regulate actin dynamics . VASP inﬂu - ences actin dynamics by protecting the barbed end of ﬁlaments from capping , by inhibiting the branching activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , and by contributing to nucleation with the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Skoble et al . , 2001 ; Bear et al . , 2002 ) . Proﬁlin binds to actin monomer and promotes actin polymerization at the barbed ends of ﬁlaments , inhibits actin polymerization at the pointed ends , and catalyzes the ex - change of ATP for ADP in actin monomers ( Sun et al . , 1995 ) . Moreover , proﬁlin potentiates actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP ( Yang et al . , 2000 ) . In contrast to the P and the WCA regions , the amino - terminal regions of WASP family proteins are more diver - gent . At their amino termini , WASP and N - WASP have an Ena / VASP homology 1 ( EVH1 ) domain that binds to WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) ( Ramesh et al . , 1997 ) and to phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) ( Miki et al . , 1996 ) . They also contain a basic stretch ( B ) that interacts with PIP 2 ( Prehoda et al . , 2000 ; Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ) and a G protein - binding domain ( G ) that binds the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 ( Symons et al . , 1996 ) . In their inactive , closed form , an in - tramolecular interaction between the G and the carboxy - terminal C region inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex - stimulating ac - tivity ( Miki et al . , 1998a ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Kim et al . , 2000 ) . Binding of Cdc42 and PIP 2 disrupts this interaction and facilitates Arp2 / 3 complex activation ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ; Prehoda et al . , 2000 ; Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ) . This mode of regulation is consistent with the cellular activities of WASP , which is involved in actin regulation downstream of Cdc42 ( Symons et al . , 1996 ) . Unlike WASP and N - WASP , the amino terminus of Scar proteins consists of a unique Scar homology domain ( SHD ) . The binding partners of the SHD are not yet well deﬁned , although they may contribute to the observed regulation of Scar down - stream of the Rho family GTPase Rac ( Miki et al . , 1998b , 2000 ) . Although WASP family proteins possess clear structural differences , how these variations contribute to their distinct functional and regulatory properties in cells is not under - stood . Moreover , despite numerous studies regarding the function of the regions of WASP family proteins in actin nucleation , the role of these regions in modulating actin - based motility has not been examined . To address these issues , we have devised a powerful in vitro motility system in which beads coated with WASP family proteins undergo actin - based motility in cytoplasmic extracts ( Yarar et al . , Figure 1 . N - terminal WASP and Scar1 truncation derivatives . ( A ) Schematic diagrams of WASP trun - cation and deletion derivatives . ( B ) Schematic dia - grams of Scar1 truncation derivatives . D . Yarar Molecular Biology of the Cell 4046 1999 ) . This bead - based assay recapitulates motile processes observed in cells and , due to the open nature of extracts , is amenable to experimental manipulation . Herein , we use this system together with a series of WASP and Scar1 truncation derivatives to deﬁne and differentiate the contributions of these protein domains to motility , and to test the role of interacting factors in this process . MATERIALS AND METHODS Generation of WASP and Scar1 Derivatives DNA encoding WASP tagged at its N terminus with both Met Arg Gly Ser ( MRGS ) 6xHis and FLAG epitopes was ampliﬁed by poly - merase chain reaction ( PCR ) from a human WASP cDNA ( a gener - ous gift of Arie Abo , PPD Discovery , Menlo Park , CA ) . The PCR product was subcloned into pFastBac1 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and pGEX4T - 1 ( Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ ) to generate the plasmids pDY10 - 1 and pDY7 , respectively . DNAs encoding WASP truncation derivatives BGPWCA , GPWCA , PWCA , and WCA were also ampliﬁed by PCR and were subcloned into pDY10 - 1 to generate plasmids pDY10 - 2 ( BPGWCA ) , pDY10 - 3 ( GP - WCA ) , pDY10 - 4 ( PWCA ) , and pDY10 - 5 ( WCA ) . DNA encoding WASP - CA was generated by PCR and subcloned into pDY7 to make plasmid pDY33 . WASP (cid:1) P was ampliﬁed by PCR from WASP (cid:1) P ( a generous gift of Arie Abo ) and subcloned into pDY10 - 1 . The DNA encoding Scar1 tagged at its N terminus with MRGS 6xHis and FLAG epitopes was ampliﬁed by PCR and subcloned into pDY10 - 1 to generate pTD9 and into pDY7 to generate pTD1 . The Scar1 truncation derivative PWCA was generated by PCR and subcloned into pTD9 to make pTD10 . The Scar1 WCA and CA derivatives were generated by PCR and subcloned into pTD1 to make pTD3 and pTD4 . Expression and Puriﬁcation of Recombinant Proteins Recombinant WASP and its truncation derivatives BGPWCA , GPWCA , PWCA , WCA , and WASP (cid:1) P , and recombinant Scar1 , its derivative PWCA , and VASP were expressed in Sf9 cells by using the baculovirus expression system . Baculovirus strains were gener - ated and used for infections according to the Bac - to - Bac baculovirus expression system ( Invitrogen ) . After 60 h of infection , cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500 (cid:2) g for 10 min at 25°C , resus - pended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 8 . 0 , 300 mM KCl ) with protease inhibitors and frozen in liquid N 2 . To prepare the lysate , cells were thawed and centrifuged at 200 , 000 (cid:2) g . To purify the recombinant proteins , Sf9 lysates were supple - mented with 20 mM imidazole , incubated wtih Ni 2 (cid:3) - NTA - agarose ( QIAGEN , Valencia , CA ) resin fo r 1 h at 4°C , washed with wash buffer ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 8 . 0 , 300 mM KCl , 20 mM imidazole ) , and eluted with elution buffer ( 200 mM imidazole , 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 8 . 0 , 300 mM KCl , and protease inhibitors ) . Eluted proteins were further puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration chromatography on a Superdex - 200 column ( Amersham Biosciences ) equilibrated with control buffer [ 20 mM 3 - ( N - morpholino ) propanesulfonic acid ( MOPS ) , pH 7 . 0 , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 10 % [ vol / vol ] glycerol ] . Recombinant GST - WASP WCA , WASP - CA , SCAR - WCA , and SCAR - CA proteins were expressed as glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusions in Escherichia coli BL21 - CodonPlus - RP cells ( Strat - agene , La Jolla , CA ) . Cells were grown to an OD 600 of 0 . 5 and induced with 0 . 4 mM isopropyl (cid:2) - d - thiogalactoside at 37°C for 3 h . Proteins were bound to glutathione - Sepharose ( Amersham Bio - sciences ) , washed with phosphate - buffered saline , and eluted with 10 mM glutathione . Eluted proteins were further puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration chromatography as described above . The GST tag was cleaved by incubation with thrombin ( (cid:4) 0 . 5 U / mg protein ) for 5 min at 25°C , and the cleavage reaction was stopped by incubation with benzamidine Sepharose ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) for 20 min at 4°C . WASP and Scar1 derivatives were isolated from GST by Ni 2 (cid:3) - NTA - agarose ( QIAGEN ) afﬁnity chromatography as described above and transferred into control buffer by using Nap5 spin col - umns ( Amersham Biosciences ) . All protein concentrations were de - termined by the Bio - Rad protein assay ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) with bovine serum albumin as a standard . Recombinant human GST - WT proﬁlin and GST - H133S proﬁlin ( plasmids kindly provided by Changsong Yang and Sally Zigmond , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA ) were expressed in E . coli strain BL21 ( DE ) , cleaved with thrombin , and puriﬁed as de - scribed previously ( Yang et al . , 2000 ) . Recombinant GST - Cdc42 V12 ( plasmid kindly provided by Arie Abo ) was expressed in E . coli strain BL21 ( DE ) . Protein was puriﬁed by glutathione afﬁnity and gel ﬁltration chromatography as described above and charged with guanosine - 5 (cid:5) - O - ( 3 - thio ) triphosphate ( GTP (cid:1) S ) as described previ - ously ( Ma et al . , 1998 ) . VASP was prepared as described previously ( Skoble et al . , 2001 ) . Pyrene - Actin Polymerization Assays Human platelet Arp2 / 3 complex ( Welch and Mitchison , 1998 ) , rab - bit skeletal muscle actin ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) , and pyrene - labeled actin ( Kouyama and Mihashi , 1981 ) were prepared as de - scribed previously . Pyrene - actin polymerization assays were performed as described previously ( Cooper et al . , 1983 ) with the following modiﬁcations . Pyrene - actin and unlabeled actin were thawed and transferred into fresh G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT ) by passing them over a 1 - ml Sepharose G25 ( Amersham Biosciences ) spin column and were then mixed to generate 3 (cid:3) M monomer solution with 10 % pyrene actin . Arp2 / 3 complex ( 10 nM ) or an equal volume of control buffer was mixed with initiation buffer ( 20 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , 5 mM ATP ) and 20 nM WASP / Scar1 derivatives in control buffer . This solution and the G actin solution ( ﬁnal concentration 2 (cid:3) M ) were incubated at room temperature for 1 min and then mixed to initiate actin polymerization . To measure the effects of GST Cdc42 - V12 and PIP 2 [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] on the activities of the WASP truncation derivatives , 10 nM Arp2 / 3 complex or control buffer was mixed with initiation buffer and 30 nM of each WASP derivative . To test the effect of PIP 2 alone , the premix was added to 2 mM PIP 2 ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) and Cdc42 buffer ( 14 mM MOPS , pH 7 . 0 , 68 mM KCl , 1 . 4 mM MgCl 2 , 22 . 4 mM EGTA , 0 . 14 mM ATP , 0 . 34 mM DTT , 7 % [ vol / vol ] glycerol , 1 mM GTP (cid:1) S , 20 . 7 mM MgCl 2 ) . To test the effect of Cdc42 alone , 10 (cid:3) l of 2 (cid:3) M GST Cdc42 - V12 and 1 (cid:3) l of control buffer were added to the premix . To test the effect of both PIP 2 and Cdc42 , 30 (cid:3) M PIP 2 and 300 nM GST Cdc42 - V12 in Cdc42 buffer were added to the premix . The premix (cid:6) Cdc42 - V12 , (cid:6) PIP 2 and 2 (cid:3) M G actin were incubated at room temperature for 1 min and then mixed to initiate actin polymerization . Assembly kinetics was monitored using a Fluorolog 3 ﬂuorometer ( Instruments S . A . ; excitation wavelength 365 nm , emission wavelength 407 nm ) maintained at a temperature of 25°C . Bead Motility Assays For coating beads with protein , 1 (cid:3) l of carboxylated polystyrene beads ( 0 . 5 (cid:3) m in diameter , 2 . 68 % solids ; Polysciences , Warrington , PA ) was incubated with various concentrations of puriﬁed proteins in 20 (cid:3) l ofﬁnal volume control buffer ( 20 mM MOPS , pH 7 . 0 , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 10 % [ vol / vol ] glycerol ) fo r 1 h atroom temperature , pelleted , and washed with XB ( 100 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 10 mM K - HEPES , pH 7 . 7 ) , and then resuspended in XB . The ﬁnal amount of protein on the beads was determined by Western blotting with an anti - FLAG antibody by using known amounts of the FLAG - tagged proteins as a standard . For motility assays , beads Motility Determinants in WASP Family Proteins Vol . 13 , November 2002 4047 were coated with a ﬁnal concentration of 10 – 20 pmol of protein bound to 1 (cid:3) l of bead slurry . For motility assays , beads were added to X . laevis egg extract ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ) supplemented with N - hydroxysuccinimidyl 5 - carboxytetramethyl rhodamine - labeled actin ( Kellogg et al . , 1988 ) and 20 (cid:2) ATP - regenerating mix ( 150 mM creatine phosphate , 20 mM ATP , 2 mM EGTA , pH 7 . 7 , 20 mM MgCl 2 ) . The extract was squashed between a slide and a coverslip and viewed after 5 - min incubation at room temperature for WASP / Scar1 derivative - coated beads or 1 - h incubation at room tempera - ture for ActA - coated beads . To determine rates of movement , dif - ferential interference contrast or ﬂuorescence images were recorded every 10 s , and rates of movement were determined by averaging the distance moved in a 60 - s time interval by using MetaMorph software ( Universal Imaging , Downington , PA ) . Statistical analysis was performed using MINITAB software . Mo - tility rates measured for the derivative - coated beads were compared using an analysis of variance test followed by a Tukey’s multiple comparison test ( set at 5 % ) . Proﬁlin Depletion / Addition Control resin ( glycine - Sepharose ) or poly - l - proline ( Sigma - Al - drich ) - Sepharose resin was blocked for at leas t 2 h in 30mg / ml bovine serum albumin and washed 3 (cid:2) with XB ( 100 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 10 mM K - HEPES , pH 7 . 7 ) . Resin was then added to X . laevis egg extract and incubated for 30 min at 4°C . The degree of depletion was determined by immuno - blotting with an anti - Xenopus proﬁlin antibody ( see below ) and comparing to known dilutions of control extract . Addback was done using 2 (cid:3) M recombinant human proﬁlin ( WT or H133S ) and / or 0 . 2 (cid:3) M recombinant human VASP or an equivalent volume of buffer ( 20 mM MOPS , pH 7 . 0 , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 10 % [ vol / vol ] glycerol ) . After addition of proﬁlin / VASP / buffer , the extract was incubated on ice for 20 min , and motility assays were performed as described above , except that slides were incubated for 20 min at room temperature before view - ing . For poly - l - proline ( PLP ) addition experiments , soluble 10 (cid:3) M PLP dissolved in XB , or XB alone was added to extract and incu - bated for 20 min . The extract was incubated on ice for 20 min and motility assays were performed as described above . To determine rates of movement , differential interference contrast or ﬂuorescence images were recorded every 5 s and rates of move - ment were determined by averaging the distance moved in 20 - s time intervals by using MetaMorph software . For PLP depletion experiments , statistical analysis was performed as described above . For PLP addition , statistical signiﬁcance was examined using a Student’s t test . WIP Pulldown Carboxylated polystyrene beads ( 3 (cid:3) l , 0 . 5 (cid:3) m in diameter , 2 . 68 % solids ; Polysciences ) were coated with 20 pmol of WASP or WASP GPWCA , and washed with control buffer ( 20 mM MOPS , pH 7 . 0 , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 10 % [ vol / vol ] glycerol ) . Coated beads were incubated with platelet extract , washed with control buffer , and proteins bound were de - termined by immunoblotting by using an anti - WIP antibody ( kindly provided by Ines Anton and Narayanaswamy Ramesh , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA ) . Antibody Preparation Proﬁlin was puriﬁed from Xenopus egg extract by poly - l - proline afﬁnity chromatography by using the procedures described in Jan - mey ( 1991 ) . Puriﬁed proﬁlin was used to immunize rabbits , and anti - Xenopus proﬁlin antibodies were puriﬁed from serum as de - scribed previously ( Harlow and Lane , 1999 ) . RESULTS Regions of WASP Family Proteins That Function in Motility To study the contribution of the regions of WASP family proteins to actin - based motility , we expressed and puriﬁed full - length WASP and Scar1 , as well as a series of truncation and deletion derivatives of both proteins ( Figure 1 ) . We named each sequential truncation derivative for the regions remaining in the molecule . WASP derivatives included WASP - BGPWCA , WASP - GPWCA , WASP - PWCA , WASP - WCA , and WASP - CA , and Scar1 derivatives included Scar1 - PWCA , Scar1 - WCA , and Scar1 - CA . We also generated a WASP deletion derivative missing the proline - rich region , which we called WASP (cid:1) P . The ability of each protein to direct motility was assessed using a bead - based assay . We showed previously that 1 - (cid:3) m - diameter beads coated with full - length WASP were motile in bovine brain extract and formed actin comet tails similar to those induced by the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes in infected cells ( Yarar et al . , 1999 ) . In this study , we used X . laevis egg extracts , which have been shown to support the locomotion of L . monocytogenes ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ) and of beads coated with ActA , the L . monocytogenes surface protein that func - tions like WASP ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ) . In addition , we used smaller diameter beads ( 0 . 5 (cid:3) m ) , which were shown to exhibit a higher frequency of movement in Xenopus egg extract when coated with ActA ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ) . Initially , we compared the relative capacities of WASP , Scar1 , and ActA to promote motility . Beads were coated with comparable concentrations of each protein ( supple - mental material , Figure S1 ) , introduced into Xenopus egg extract , and monitored for their abilities to promote actin polymerization and movement ( Figure 2 ) . Motility rates were measured and the distributions of rates ( Figure 3 ) were compared to determine whether they were statistically dis - tinct at the 95 % conﬁdence level by using an analysis of variance test followed by a Tukey’s multiple comparison test . Beads coated with full - length WASP moved at a rate of 8 . 3 (cid:6) 0 . 3 (cid:3) m / min ( mean (cid:6) 2 times SE ; 95 % conﬁdence interval ) in egg extracts , 42 - fold faster than the rate for 1 - (cid:3) m beads in bovine brain extract ( 0 . 2 (cid:3) m / min ) ( Yarar et al . , 1999 ) . This rate was signiﬁcantly faster than for ActA - and Scar1 - coated beads ( 6 . 5 (cid:6) 1 . 0 and 5 . 8 (cid:6) 0 . 4 (cid:3) m / min , respec - tively ) , which were statistically indistinguishable from each other . Although both WASP beads and Scar1 beads initiated movement immediately after introduction into the extract , ActA - coated beads required a 20 - to 30 - min incubation be - fore actin clouds were formed at the bead surfaces and 1 h before tail formation and motility were observed . This may be due to differences in the availability or function of factors that each protein recruits to stimulate actin polymerization . Next , to evaluate the functions of the different regions of WASP in actin - based motility , each WASP derivative was tested using the bead assay . Beads coated with WASP - BGPWCA , WASP - GPWCA , WASP - PWCA , WASP - WCA , and WASP (cid:1) P were able to polymerize actin , form tails , and move immediately after introduction into the extract ( Figure 2A ) . In contrast , WASP - CA – coated beads did not form tails , but were able to assemble a faint cloud of actin when coated with 20 - fold more protein . Thus , WASP - WCA is the mini - mum region that is sufﬁcient to direct motility in Xenopus D . Yarar Molecular Biology of the Cell 4048 egg extracts . The motility rates of these derivative - coated beads were also measured and compared with full - length WASP ( Figure 3 ) . In general , motility rates were propor - tional to the length of actin tails formed behind the moving beads , as was observed previously for moving L . monocyto - genes in infected cells ( Theriot et al . , 1992 ) . WASP - WCA , the minimal region required for motility , formed short tails and promoted slower movement ( 3 . 3 (cid:6) 0 . 3 (cid:3) m / min ) than any of the other derivatives tested . Derivatives containing the pro - line - rich region , including WASP - PWCA ( 6 . 2 (cid:6) 0 . 3 (cid:3) m / min ) , WASP - GPWCA ( 5 . 3 (cid:6) 0 . 4 (cid:3) m / min ) , and WASP - BGPWCA ( 5 . 9 (cid:6) 0 . 3 (cid:3) m / min ) , formed longer tails and promoted faster movement . Similarly , WASP (cid:1) P ( 5 . 2 (cid:6) 0 . 6 (cid:3) m / min ) , which lacks the P region but retains the WASP N terminus ( EVH1 - B - G ) , promoted faster motility than the WASP - WCA – coated beads . These four derivatives exhibited rate distributions that were statistically indistinguishable from one another and from ActA - and Scar1 - coated beads . All of the WASP truncation derivatives promoted move - ment at signiﬁcantly slower rates than did full - length WASP , which contains both the P region and the EVH1 domain . Taken together , these results indicate that the P region and the EVH1 domain of WASP make separate stim - ulatory contributions to motility . In a similar analysis of Scar1 derivatives , only Scar1 - PWCA was capable of directing actin polymerization , tail formation , and movement ( Figure 2B ) . Beads coated with the smaller Scar1 - WCA fragment polymerized actin but were not motile , and Scar CA - coated beads were only able to polymerize residual amounts of actin when coated with 20 - fold excess protein . Thus , unlike WASP , the minimum fragment of Scar1 that was sufﬁcient to direct motility was Scar1 - PWCA . The rate of motility of Scar1 - PWCA beads ( 6 . 6 (cid:6) 0 . 4 (cid:3) m / min ) was indistinguishable from the larger Figure 2 .

Motility Determinants in WASP Family Proteins Vol . 13 , November 2002 4049 WASP derivative - coated beads but was statistically faster than beads coated with full - length Scar1 or WASP - WCA ( Figure 3 ) . These results indicate that the central P region of Scar1 plays an essential stimulatory role in motility , whereas the N - terminal SHD exhibits a slight inhibitory effect . The observed differences in motility rates for WASP and Scar1 derivatives were not caused by small differences in the amount of protein coating the beads , as beads coated with amounts of each derivative varying over a ten - fold range moved at indistinguishable rates ( Table 1 ) . This is consistent with results found for beads coated with varying concentra - tions of ActA ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ) . All derivatives were able to direct motility when coated onto the beads at a concentration of 1 – 2 pmol of protein per microliter of bead slurry , with the exception of WASP - WCA beads , which only generated tails when coated with 10 – 20 pmol of protein per microliter bead slurry ( Table 1 ) . Similarly , beads coated with GST - WASP WCA also required 10 – 20 pmol of protein bound per microliter of bead slurry to initiate motility , and moved at rates that were indistinguishable from WASP - WCA beads . These results support the conclusion that WASP - WCA is less potent than the larger derivatives , and thus is required at higher surface concentrations to initiate motility . Factors Other Than the Arp2 / 3 Complex Contribute to Motility The EVH1 domain of WASP and the P regions of WASP and Scar could enhance motility by directly stimulating the ac - tin - nucleating activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , or by recruit - ing proteins that themselves stimulate actin polymerization . To distinguish between these possibilities , the activities of WASP and Scar1 derivatives were tested for Arp2 / 3 com - Figure 3 .

Motility Determinants in WASP Family Proteins Vol . 13 , November 2002 4051 plex - stimulating activity by using the pyrene - actin polymer - ization assay ( Figure 4 ) . Full - length WASP ( Yarar et al . , 1999 ) and Scar1 exhibited comparably robust activities , although native WASP from bovine thymus has been shown to be autoinhibited in the absence of Cdc42 or PIP 2 ( Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ) . The differences between recombinant and native WASP may reﬂect differences in posttranslational modiﬁcation or folding upon expression in insect cells . However , we found that recombinant WASP was still able to bind to the interacting protein WIP ( supplemental material , Figure S2 ) , indicating that improper folding of the EVH1 domain is not the cause of activation . In contrast to full - length WASP , the WASP - BGPWCA and WASP - GPWCA derivatives were virtually inactive in actin nucleation , con - sistent with the previously described role of the B and G regions in autoinhibition ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ; Kim et al . , 2000 ; Prehoda et al . , 2000 ; Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex stimulatory activities of these truncations were dramatically enhanced by the addition of PIP 2 and Cdc42 - GTP ( supplemental material , Figure S3 ) , as reported for full - length native WASP ( Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ) and N - WASP ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ; Kim et al . , 2000 ; Prehoda et al . , 2000 ; Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ) . Interestingly , although both truncations exhibited maximal stimulation with a combination of PIP 2 and Cdc42 - GTP , WASP - BGPWCA could be stimulated by either Cdc42 or PIP 2 alone , whereas WASP - GPWCA could only be stim - ulated by Cdc42 in the presence of PIP 2 , as previously shown for the regulation of native full - length WASP ( Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ) . These results suggest that PIP 2 can stim - ulate nucleation by binding to regions other than the previ - ously identiﬁed binding site in the B region ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ; Kim et al . , 2000 ; Prehoda et al . , 2000 ; Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ) . The smaller derivatives , which lack the inhibitory regions , exhibited a range of activities . WASP - PWCA was as active as full - length WASP and Scar1 , although minor differences between WASP and WASP - PWCA could be observed , sug - gesting that the EVH1 domain may have a subtle effect on actin polymerization . WASP - WCA and Scar1 - PWCA were less active , but were comparable with one another . Scar1 - WCA was signiﬁcantly less active than the other derivatives , in agreement with previous ﬁndings ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Yamaguchi et al . , 2000 ; Zalevsky et al . , 2001 ) , suggesting that the P region of Scar1 contributes to Arp2 / 3 complex activa - tion . WASP - CA and Scar1 - CA did not activate the Arp2 / 3 complex under the conditions tested , indicating that the W region is essential for activity . When we compared these ﬁndings with the results from the bead motility assay ( Table 2 ) , we found that the direct effects of the regions of WASP and Scar1 on Arp2 / 3 complex stimulation could not entirely account for their inﬂuence on motility rates . For example , although the nucleating activity of WASP , WASP - PWCA , and Scar1 were similar to one another , WASP promoted signiﬁcantly faster movement in the bead assay . This suggests that the EVH1 domain of WASP , which is absent in the other proteins , can stimulate motility through a mechanism that does not involve direct activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . In addition , although Scar1 - PWCA and WASP - WCA were comparable with one another in nucleation activity , Scar1 - PWCA beads moved signiﬁcantly faster than WASP - WCA beads . Thus , the P region of WASP family proteins also stimulates motility independently of its direct effect on Arp2 / 3 complex activ - ity . Taken together , these observations suggest that the EVH1 and P regions of WASP and Scar1 recruit cytoplasmic factors other than the Arp2 / 3 complex that enhance motility . Proﬁlin Recruitment Enhances Motility Mediated by WASP Family Proteins One appealing candidate for mediating the motility - promot - ing activity of the EVH1 and P regions of WASP family proteins is proﬁlin , which interacts directly with the P re - gions of WASP and Scar1 ( Miki et al . , 1998b ; Suetsugu et al . , 1998 ) and indirectly with the EVH1 domain of WASP through WIP ( Ramesh et al . , 1997 ) . A second candidate is VASP , an F - actin binding protein that binds directly to WASP and requires the P region for this interaction ( Castel - lano et al . , 2001 ) . To investigate whether proﬁlin and VASP play critical roles in WASP - and Scar1 - bead motility , we ﬁrst examined the capacity of WASP - and Scar1 - coated beads to form actin tails and move in egg extracts depleted of proﬁlin and VASP by using PLP . Treatment of egg extracts with PLP - Sepharose matrix resulted in the depletion of (cid:8) 90 % of the proﬁlin and VASP , but (cid:9) 5 % of the total Arp2 / 3 complex and actin ( our unpublished data ) . As a control , extracts were treated with N - terminally blocked Sepharose resin . In the control extract , WASP - and Scar1 - coated beads formed actin tails and moved through the extract ( Figures 5 and 6 ) , but at reduced rates compared with an untreated extract . In contrast , PLP depletion greatly compromised the motility of WASP - and Scar1 - coated beads . Although these beads were able to form short tails , motility was reduced to rates observed for GST - WASP WCA - coated beads . Motility rates were also slowed upon the direct addition of 10 (cid:3) M PLP to egg extracts ( Figure 6D ) . The separate addition of either recombinant wild - type ( wt ) proﬁlin ( 2 (cid:3) M ) or recombinant VASP ( 0 . 2 (cid:3) M ) to the depleted extract did not affect bead motility rates for WASP or Scar1 , although VASP addition increased overall tail length ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . In contrast , the simultaneous ad - Table 2 . Comparison of WASP / Scar1 derivatives ; bead motility rates vs .

Asterisk ( * ) indicates derivatives that are autoinhibited . D . Yarar Molecular Biology of the Cell 4052 dition of wt proﬁlin and VASP to the PLP - depleted extract signiﬁcantly increased motility rates of WASP and Scar1 beads ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . Even under these conditions , the rates were not fully restored to control levels , suggesting a technical limitation of the depletion experiment or a require - ment for other factors that may have been removed during the depletion . The addition of a mutant form of proﬁlin ( R74E ) that has a reduced afﬁnity for actin ( Korenbaum et al . , 1998 ) , alone or in combination with VASP , did not restore the bead motility rates ( our unpublished data ) , indicating that the actin - binding activity of proﬁlin is needed to en - hance WASP and Scar1 - bead motility rates . These results indicate that proﬁlin and VASP , perhaps in combination with other factors , enhance WASP - and Scar1 - bead motility in Xenopus egg extracts . To examine whether the recruitment of proﬁlin by the proline - rich sequences of WASP or Scar1 contributes to bead movement , we assessed the ability of another mutant form of proﬁlin ( H133S ) to restore actin tail formation in depleted extracts . Proﬁlin - H133S has a reduced afﬁnity for polypro - line sequences ( Bjorkegren - Sjogren et al . , 1997 ) such as those in WASP and Scar1 , but has a normal afﬁnity for actin ( Egile et al . , 1999 ; Yang et al . , 2000 ) . The addition of 2 (cid:3) M proﬁlin - H133S alone or in combination with VASP to depleted ex - tracts did not increase the motility rates of either WASP - or Scar1 - coated beads , indicating that binding of proﬁlin to its polyproline ligands is important for its ability to stimulate WASP - and Scar1 - bead motility . To further examine whether proﬁlin exerts its activity by interacting with the polyproline motifs within WASP and Scar1 , or instead has a general effect on actin dynamics in the extract , we examined the behavior of GST - WASP WCA beads in the depleted extract . We reasoned that if proﬁlin activity requires an interaction with WASP and Scar1 , the motility rates of WASP - WCA beads should be unaffected by PLP depletion . Alternatively , if proﬁlin exerts a global effect on actin dynamics , GST - WASP WCA bead movement should be compromised by PLP depletion . Strikingly , GST - WASP WCA bead motility was not affected by PLP deple - tion , PLP addition , or by the addback of VASP , wt proﬁlin , or H133S proﬁlin , separately or in combination ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . Thus , the effect of proﬁlin on WASP - and Scar1 - bead motility requires the EVH1 and P regions , which are absent from the WCA derivative . Interestingly , addition of VASP alone increased the length of actin tails formed behind the moving GST - WASP - WCA beads without affecting motility rates , indicating that VASP can exert an effect without di - rectly interacting with WASP family proteins . In summary , our results strongly implicate the P region and EVH1 do - main of WASP and Scar1 in enhancing actin - based motility by recruiting additional factors that include proﬁlin . DISCUSSION A Threshold of Actin - nucleating Activity Is Required to Initiate Motility The actin - nucleating and - branching activities of the Arp2 / 3 complex are critical for WASP - bead ( Yarar et al . , 1999 ) and L . monocytogenes motility ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ; May et al . , 1999 ; Yarar et al . , 1999 ) . However , the precise relationship between actin nucleation and actin - based motility is not well deﬁned . We have found that the smallest fragment of WASP that stimulates the nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , WASP - WCA , is also the minimal region that is sufﬁcient to support motility in egg extracts . Thus , it seems that the ability to stimulate the actin - nucleating and - branching ac - tivities of the Arp2 / 3 complex is sufﬁcient to induce motil - ity . In agreement with this conclusion , this region is also able to support actin - based bead motility in a reconstitution sys - tem consisting of puriﬁed proteins ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ) . Moreover , the corresponding N - terminal region of ActA , which contains similar functional regions ( Skoble et al . , 2000 ) , also supports the movement of L . monocytogenes ( Lasa et al . , 1995 ) . However , the N - WASP - WCA region is unable to support motility in bovine brain extract ( Suetsugu et al . , 2001b ) , most likely reﬂecting differences in the protein complement in brain and Xenopus eggs . Importantly , the WCA fragment of Scar1 , which was less active than WASP - WCA in stimulating nucleation with the Arp2 / 3 complex ( this report ; Yamaguchi et al . , 2000 ; Zalevsky et al . , 2001 ) , was unable to direct motility in Xenopus egg extract . This indicates that the WCA regions of different WASP family proteins are functionally distinct , and suggests that a thresh - old of nucleation activity must be achieved to initiate move - ment . Enhancement of Motility by the Proline - rich Region and EVH1 Domain Although the WASP - WCA fragment could direct move - ment , the presence of the P region and the EVH1 domain signiﬁcantly enhanced motility rates . Moreover , the P region of Scar1 was required to initiate movement . Thus , the P regions and EVH1 domain play critical stimulatory roles . In agreement with the critical role of the P region , deletion of this region of N - WASP results in a reduction in the size of microspikes formed in response to EGF stimulation ( Suet - sugu et al . , 1998 ) and an inhibition of actin polymerization by the bacterial pathogen Shigella ﬂexneri ( Mimuro et al . , 2000 ) , which recruits N - WASP to its surface to initiate mo - tility in infected cells ( Suzuki et al . , 1998 ) . Deletion of the N - WASP EVH1 domain has also been shown to reduce the rate of actin polymerization induced in bovine brain extract , as measured in a pyrene - actin assembly assay ( Suetsugu et al . , 2001a ) . Furthermore , missense mutations in the EVH1 domain of WASP result in (cid:8) 85 % of all known cases of Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( Schindelhauer et al . , 1996 ) . Our results indicate that the direct effects of the WASP EVH1 domain and the P regions of WASP and Scar1 on actin nucleation with the Arp2 / 3 complex is not sufﬁcient to account for the increased motility rates conferred by these regions in cell extracts . This suggests that the enhancement of motility by the P region and EVH1 domain is most likely mediated by proteins that bind to these regions . A number of binding partners for the P regions in WASP and Scar1 have been identiﬁed , including a variety of SH3 domain - containing proteins , such as Grb2 ( Carlier et al . , 2000 ) , IRSp53 ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) , WISH ( Fukuoka et al . , 2001 ) , and Nck ( Rohatgi et al . , 2001 ) . These proteins have been shown to increase the Arp2 / 3 complex - stimulating activity of WASP family proteins , suggesting one possible mechanism for en - hancing motility . The P region also binds to proﬁlin ( for WASP and Scar1 ) and to VASP ( binding only examined for WASP ) , actin - binding proteins whose functional properties are discussed below ( Miki et al . , 1998b ; Suetsugu et al . , 1998 ; Motility Determinants in WASP Family Proteins Vol . 13 , November 2002 4053 Figure 5 .

Images were taken after samples were incubated on the slide for 30 min . Bar , 2 (cid:3) m . D . Yarar Molecular Biology of the Cell 4054 Castellano et al . , 2001 ) . To date , the only identiﬁed EVH1 domain - binding protein is WIP ( Ramesh et al . , 1997 ) . Al - though the biochemical activity of WIP remains unclear , it acts in concert with N - WASP in cells to promote the forma - tion of ﬁlopodia ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2001 ) , making it a candidate stimulatory factor . Moreover , its binding partners Nck ( Anton et al . , 1998 ; Rohatgi et al . , 2001 ) and proﬁlin ( Yang et al . , 2000 ) enhance actin nucleation and ﬁlament polymerization and may mediate the stimulatory effect of the EVH1 domain on motility . Alternatively , factors other than WIP may be recruited to the EVH1 domain to enhance motility rates . Unlike the EVH1 domain , the SHD of Scar1 had only a slight effect on motility , suggesting that its primary function may be in regulating Scar1 activity or localization . This observation highlights the functional distinctions between the EVH1 and SHD domains and suggests that they serve as determinants for the different activities of WASP and Scar1 in cells . However , because the binding partners of the SHD are unknown , it is not yet clear how this domain contributes to Scar1 function . Similarly , the WASP B and G regions did not affect mo - tility in our assay . Although the G region allows truncations of WASP to be autoinhibited in solution and prevents them from stimulating the Arp2 / 3 complex , beads coated with WASP - BGPWCA or WASP - GPWCA polymerized puriﬁed actin in the presence of puriﬁed Arp2 / 3 complex , indicating that autoinhibition is relieved by binding to the beads ( D . Y . and M . D . W . , unpublished observations ) . This may explain our observation that activation or inhibition of G proteins in egg extracts by the addition of GTP (cid:1) S or of dominant neg - ative forms of Cdc42 and Rac had no effect on the formation of actin clouds or tails or on motility rates ( D . Y . and M . D . W . , unpublished observations ) . This also suggests that G pro - teins do not enhance motility of the coated beads once movement has been initiated . Role of Proﬁlin and VASP in Motility Mediated by WASP Family Proteins We found that removal of (cid:8) 90 % of both proﬁlin and VASP by treatment of Xenopus egg extracts with PLP dramatically slowed the motility of both WASP and Scar1 beads . Faster motility rates could be substantially restored by the addition of wild - type proﬁlin together with VASP , but not with the addition of a mutant form of proﬁlin that does not bind to proline - rich sequences . Importantly , the motility of GST - WASP - WCA beads was not affected either by PLP depletion or by the addback of VASP and proﬁlin . This demonstrates that proﬁlin exerts its effects by interacting with proline - rich sequences in WASP family proteins either directly , or indi - rectly through VASP or an unidentiﬁed factor . Consistent with the critical role of proﬁlin demonstrated herein , several studies have shown that proﬁlin enhances the motility rates of the bacterial pathogens L . monocytogenes and Shigella ﬂexneri in cell extracts and in a reconstitution system consisting of puriﬁed proteins ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ; Marchand et al . , 1995 ; Egile et al . , 1999 ; Loisel et al . , 1999 ; Mimuro et al . , 2000 ) . Although proﬁlin binds directly to the P regions of WASP family proteins ( Miki et al . , 1998b ; Suet - sugu et al . , 1998 ) and indirectly with the EVH1 domain of WASP via WIP ( Ramesh et al . , 1997 ) , the functional impor - tance of this binding interaction has been debated . Although some suggest that proﬁlin binding to the polyproline ligands is not required to enhance Shigella actin - based motility ( Egile et al . , 1999 ) , others have reported that the direct binding of proﬁlin to polyproline ligands is important for its stimula - tory role ( Mimuro et al . , 2000 ) . Our results strongly suggest that an interaction between proﬁlin and the P regions of WASP and Scar1 is vital for proﬁlin to enhance actin - based motility . In support of a role for proﬁlin binding to proline - rich sequences , this activity is important for its ability to stimulate Arp2 / 3 complex and WASP protein - mediated ac - tin nucleation in neutrophil extracts in response to activated Cdc42 ( Yang et al . , 2000 ) . However , we were unable to detect an effect of proﬁlin on actin nucleation by puriﬁed WASP / Scar1 and Arp2 / 3 complex ( D . Y . and M . D . W . , unpublished observations ) , suggesting that , if it affects actin nucleation , it only does so in the presence of other cytosolic factors . In addition to polyproline binding , we and others have found that the ability of proﬁlin to bind to actin is also required for its role in actin - based motility ( Egile et al . , 1999 ; Mimuro et al . , 2000 ; this study ) . Recruitment of proﬁlin may function in motility by enhancing actin nucleation with Arp2 / 3 com - plex , or by increasing the local concentration of polymeriza - tion competent actin through desequestration of actin from thymosin (cid:2) 4 ( Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ) . Although proﬁlin can bind directly to the P region of WASP and Scar1 , it also binds to the proline - rich motif in VASP ( Reinhard et al . , 1995 ) . Therefore , VASP may function in part by recruiting proﬁlin to WASP and Scar1 . Interest - ingly , Listeria move at reduced rates in cells expressing a derivative of VASP missing the proﬁlin binding site ( Geese et al . , 2002 ) , suggesting a role for the interaction between Ena / VASP proteins and proﬁlin in actin - based motility . VASP may also play a role in WASP and Scar1 - bead motility that is independent of its interaction with proﬁlin . This idea is supported by our observation that the addition VASP increases the length of actin tails formed by WASP - and Scar1 - coated beads , and by the ﬁnding that VASP can en - hance Listeria and WASP - bead motility in the absence of proﬁlin in a reconstitution system consisting of puriﬁed proteins ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ; Castellano et al . , 2001 ) . This effect may result from the ability of VASP to bundle F - actin ( Bach - mann et al . , 1999 ; Laurent et al . , 1999 ) , which may stabilize actin tails and protect them from depolymerization . VASP also enhances the nucleating activity of ActA and the Arp2 / 3 complex , reduces the branching frequency of the Arp2 / 3 complex , and protects the barbed end of actin ﬁla - ments from capping proteins ( Skoble et al . , 2001 ; Bear et al . , 2002 ) . Further experimentation will be required to clarify the contributions of each activity of VASP in actin - based bead motility mediated by WASP - family proteins and to deter - mine whether VASP exerts its effect on actin - based motility by binding to WASP and Scar1 . Although our results indicate that proﬁlin and VASP en - hance the rates of motility of WASP - and Scar1 - coated beads , it is notable that bead motility rates in PLP - treated extracts were not completely restored by the addition of puriﬁed proﬁlin and VASP . This suggests that other polyproline binding factors , for example SH3 or WW do - main containing proteins , may also contribute to motility . Based on our ﬁndings , we propose a model for the func - tion of the regions of WASP - family proteins in actin - based motility ( illustrated for WASP in Figure 7 ) .

Yarar Molecular Biology of the Cell 4056 region , the minimum region that stimulates actin nucleation with the Arp2 / 3 complex , is sufﬁcient to promote slow rates of actin - based bead motility . Full - length WASP and Scar1 , which possess additional functional regions , recruit other factors that promote more rapid rates of bead motility . Re - gions of WASP and Scar1 that enhance motility include the P region , which recruits proﬁlin , VASP ( only demonstrated for WASP ) , and SH3 - domain containing proteins , and the EVH1 domain of WASP , which recruits WIP and proﬁlin . These factors may enhance motility by stimulating the nu - cleating activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , or by stabilizing or promoting the elongation of newly formed ﬁlaments . Hence , the acceleration of both ﬁlament nucleation and elongation by factors recruited by the P regions of WASP and Scar1 and the EVH1 domain of WASP may regulate cellular actin - based motility .
