Recent studies have shown that microtubules and F - actin can assemble to form a composite structure where F - actin occupies the microtubule lumen . Whether these cytoskeletal hybrids exist in physiological settings and how they are formed is unclear . Here , we show that the short - crossover Class I actin filament previously identified inside microtubules in human HAP1 cells is cofilin - bound F - actin . Lumenal F - actin can be reconstituted in vitro , but cofilin is not essential . Moreover , actin filaments with both cofilin - bound and canonical morphologies reside within human platelet microtubules under physiological conditions . We propose that stress placed upon the microtubule network during motor - driven microtubule looping and sliding may facilitate the incorporation of actin into microtubules . Introduction Crosstalk between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons is essential for many cellular processes [ 1 , 2 ] . This is thought to be mediated by proteins that directly connect or signal between the two dynamic networks to coordinate their activities . However , recent studies have challenged this framework by showing that microtubules and F - actin can assemble to form an unanticipated composite structure where F - actin occupies the lumen of the cylindrical tubulin polymer [ 3 , 4 ] . Lumenal actin filaments were identified in human HAP1 cells treated with a small molecule that targets kinesin - 1 to induce the formation of thin , membrane bound , microtubule - based projections that are highly accessible to cryo - electron tomography ( cryoET ) [ 4 ] . In this system , microtubules form a dynamic bundle and lumenal actin filaments are highly abundant , with morphologies ( named Class I and Class II ) that are distinct from the canonical cytoplasmic / muscle form ; principally , the cross - over spacing between the two ‘long - pitch’ strands of the actin double helix is short ( at around 27 nm ) , compared to the canonical 35 – 37 nm [ 5 - 7 ] . This suggested that actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) which modify the twist of the filament may be present [ 8 , 9 ] . CryoET analysis of Drosophila S2 cells revealed similar filaments in microtubule - based projections in cells treated with the actin - targeting drug cytochalasin D , whose abundance was enhanced by additional treatment of cells with thapsigargin [ 3 ] . Sub - tomogram averaging and knockdown studies demonstrated that these filaments are composed of cofilin - bound F - actin ( cofilactin ) ; cofilin is known to change the twist of F - actin [ 9 , 10 ] . Together , these studies show that F - actin can occupy the microtubule lumen in chemically - induced microtubule - based projections emerging from both human and insect cells in culture . However , basic requirements for formation of these structures are unknown . Moreover , the impact of these small - molecule manipulations and the fact that these studies were performed on cultured cells , leaves the physiological occurrence of lumenal actin unclear . Here , we examine the composition of lumenal F - actin in human HAP1 cells and show that the Class I filament is composed of cofilin - bound F - actin . To explore the requirements for the formation of these structures , we utilise an in vitro reconstitution system which demonstrates that , although cofilin - bound F - actin can incorporate into microtubules , cofilin is not essential . A dynamic and bundled microtubule cytoskeleton is present in native human platelets [ 11 ] and Focussed - Ion - Beam ( FIB ) milling and cryoET reveals that actin filaments with both cofilin - bound and canonical morphologies are found within platelet microtubules , providing an unequivocal identification of lumenal F - actin in a physiological setting that is not modified by small - molecule treatment . Results and Discussion The cofilin - bound F - actin recently identified within the microtubule lumen in Drosophila S2 cells is morphologically similar to the Class I filament observed in human HAP1 cells [ 3 , 4 ] There are two shared features of particular note ; firstly , the short spacing of the ‘crossovers’ of the actin double helix that can be readily identified and directly measured in high - quality tomograms and are apparent as layer lines in their power spectra [ 4 ] ; and secondly , the smooth appearance of the filament that is distinct from the classic ‘beads on a string’ appearance of canonical F - actin [ 12 ] . To determine whether human Class I filaments are cofilin - bound F - actin , we treated HAP1 cells with the kinesin - 1 targeting small - molecule ‘kinesore’ to induce projections using our established protocol and imaged those projections with cryoET using a 300kV Titan Krios microscope ( Fig . 1A - C ) [ 4 , 13 ] . In this new dataset , we observed lumenal actin filaments corresponding to the Class I and Class II forms ( Fig . 1B and Fig . 1D , top left ) [ 4 ] . Class II filaments showed an F - actin - like power spectrum with short crossover spacing augmented with a prominent meridional layer line indicating a deviation from the typical F - actin helical morphology ( Fig . S1A ) . We also observed rarer examples of a morphologically distinct filament that we named Class III that did not display an F - actin - like power spectrum ( Fig . 1D , top right , Fig . S1B ) . Nonetheless , images showing transitions between filament classes through breaks or less well - defined intermediates suggest that each of these filaments are likely to be actin structures , perhaps undergoing disassembly or assembly , or with different binding partners ( Fig . 1D , middle and bottom ) . This opens the intriguing possibility that lumenal actin is dynamic . Of 51 lumenal filaments in this new dataset , 35 displayed the Class I morphology , with a crossover spacing ( measured directly from layer lines ) of 27 . 66 nm ( + / - 0 . 23 s . d . ) that contrasted with the long cross - over spacing of a canonical actin filament ( Fig . 1E , F ) . We performed helical reconstructions to generate 3D maps on the five highest quality images , and one representative example is shown ( Fig . 1G ) . Docking of a cryo - electron microscopy ( cryoEM ) structure of canonical F - actin ( light blue ) ( PDB : 8D17 ) [ 14 ] into the Class I helical reconstruction model was insufficient to explain the density . In contrast , when a cryoEM cofilin - actin structure ( dark blue and magenta ) ( PDB : 3J0S ) [ 15 ] was docked in , it fitted our model well ( cross correlation score 0 . 92 ) ( Fig . 1G ) . Similarly , our model fitted well with density of cofilin - actin filaments from the lumen of microtubules in S2 cells ( Fig . S1C ) [ 3 ] . Together , these data enable us to conclude that the Class I filament in HAP1 cells is cofilin - bound F - actin . To define basic requirements for the incorporation of F - actin into microtubules , we used an in vitro reconstitution system , taking advantage of the ‘TicTac’ buffer that allows dynamic assembly of both polymers [ 16 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . When purified actin and tubulin were polymerised together , both F - actin and microtubules could be observed using cryoET ( Fig . 2 A ) . In samples where cofilin was present , the short crossovers and distinct morphology of the actin filaments was readily apparent ( pink arrowheads ) [ 9 ] , confirming the proposition that these characteristics are a good proxy for the presence of high levels of bound cofilin in cryoET images of F - actin in situ ( Fig . 2B ) . Occasionally , F - actin and cofilin - bound filaments were found to run alongside microtubules , but most formed a lose mesh that was not microtubule associated . In both conditions , we were able to observe lumenal filaments in a minority of the microtubules ( ≈ 2 % for F - actin alone and ≈ 5 % for cofilin - actin ) ( Fig . 2 C , D ) . The appearance of these in vitro lumenal cofilin - actin filaments was indistinguishable from Class I filaments observed in situ in HAP1 cells . We also noted examples of actin / cofilin - actin filaments apparently associated with breaks in the microtubule lattice or emerging from microtubule ends ( Fig . 2E , F ) . Thus , both F - actin and cofilin - bound F - actin can incorporate into the microtubule lumen . Although cofilin - bound F - actin is the predominant form in HAP1 and S2 cells ( pointing to a functional or regulatory role for cofilin ) , addition of cofilin is not essential for F - actin incorporation in this simple in vitro system . We next sought to establish whether lumenal actin filaments exist in native or primary cells under physiological conditions without small - molecule treatments . We considered that one factor in common between systems where microtubule lumenal F - actin has been unambiguously observed is that microtubules are most likely under significant mechanical stress , as the formation of extended microtubule - based projections is driven by microtubule motors [ 4 , 17 ] . Indeed , projections in HAP1 cells form through the extrusion of tight microtubule loops that push against the plasma membrane [ 4 ] . CryoET analysis of the tips of these loops show evidence of extreme microtubule curvature , breakage and depolymerisation and the presence of all three filament classes ( both in and outside of the microtubule lumen ) , ( Fig . S2 ; Supplementary Movie 1 ) . Ostensibly similar motor - driven microtubule looping is important for extrusion in platelet biogenesis from mega - karyocytes [ 18 ] resulting in a dynamic circumferential bundle of microtubules within platelets themselves . This characteristic bundle , called the marginal band , mechanically maintains the platelet discoid shape during their resting state and rapidly remodels under platelet activation [ 11 , 19 - 21 ] . Because of the relative thickness of platelets ( compared to small - molecule induced projections ) , we turned to FIB - milling . Human platelets were put on EM grids , plunge frozen , thinned by FIB - milling and analysed using cryoET ( Fig . 3A ) . We observed bundled microtubule structures which are consistent with the marginal band [ 22 - 24 ] ( Fig . 3B , C ; Supplementary Movie 2 ) , as well as more isolated microtubules ( Fig . 3D , E ) . Within the microtubules , actin filaments were readily identified in 6 out of 25 tomograms with visible sections of microtubule lumen , from 2 independent platelet preparations . Consistent with previous observations in HAP1 and S2 cells , the majority had the distinctive Class I cofilin - bound F - actin morphology ( Fig . 3B , C , D insets ) , although we also observed less frequent examples of long - crossover filaments more closely resembling the canonical cofilin - free form , consistent with our in vitro reconstitution assays ( Fig . 3E , inset ) . We did not observe clear examples of Class II and Class III filaments in platelets or in vitro . This may reflect the relatively high abundance of lumenal filaments in the HAP1 cell system , or a missing component in the in vitro reconstitution system . In any case , the presence of these structures in HAP1 cell projections highlights the importance of considering intermediates on an assembly / disassembly pathway . This may be particularly important when examining morphologically diverse lumenal material in other cell types that has filamentous character but unknown composition [ 25 ] . Structural studies of Class II and Class III filaments are therefore a priority . In summary , we have characterised the form and composition of microtubule lumenal F - actin in situ , reconstituted cofilin - free and cofilin - bound forms in vitro , and demonstrated that lumenal F - actin is present in ex vivo primary human cells without chemical modification . Going forward , it will be useful to explore the effect of mutations in cytoskeletal genes that cause hereditary thrombocytopenias , including in the cofilin pathway , for effects on lumenal F - actin [ 26 - 28 ] . More broadly , this challenge to the textbook representation of cytoskeletal composition and crosstalk should lead to a sustained effort to understand the function and regulation of lumenal actin in platelets and determine its presence in other cell types . These latter efforts should focus on settings where microtubules are under structural and mechanical stress . Our findings suggest that a full understanding will require development of new models of single filament actin dynamics in confined environments and new experimental systems to explore the impact of lumenal F - actin on microtubule properties .

Material and Methods HAP1 cell culture and fluorescence imaging HAP1 cells were grown in Iscove - modified Dulbecco Media with 10 % FBS and penicillin / streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5 % CO2 incubator . For fluorescence imaging , cells were prepared by an established protocol in Paul et al . [ 4 ] and stained using TUB 2 . 1 monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 1000 , T4026 , Sigma - Aldrich ) detected with anti - mouse secondary antibody directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 ( 1 : 500 , A11004 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , and stained for β - actin using 13E5 rabbit monoclonal antibody directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 ( 1 : 500 , 8844 , Cell Signalling Technology ) . HAP1 cell culture and cryoET HAP1 cells were grown as above . For kinesore treatment , Quantifoil R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 gold 300 mesh grids ( Agar Scientific ) were coated with 1mg / ml of fibronectin in a 6 well plate overnight at 37 °C . Cells were then plated at 0 . 5x10 5 cells per well and incubated for 2 days at 37 °C . Cells were washed with Ringer’s buffer ( pH 6 . 8 ) and treated with kinesore ( Chembridge Corporation ) at 0 . 2 % concentration in DMSO ( 0 . 2 % DMSO for control ) , in Ringer’s buffer ( pH 6 . 8 ) for 1 hour , in a non - CO2 incubator . Grids were lifted out of the media and 10 nm gold fiducial markers were applied on the grids . Samples were blotted and plunge frozen in liquid ethane using a Leica EM GP plunge freezer . Cryo - EM grids were clipped and screened on Tecnai20 LaB6 TEM ( FEI ) at 200kV with a Gatan 626 cryo - transfer holder and sent to Diamond Light Source Electron Bio - Imaging Centre ( eBIC ) for tomography data collection at 64 , 000x magnification on a Titan Krios microscope with Falcon4 detector and a 5eV slit ( Thermo Fisher ) . Tomographic series were acquired using a dose symmetric scheme , with increments of 3 degrees . Sample shown in Fig . S2 of a projection tip were acquired as part of the dataset reported in [ 4 ] and processed as described there . Tomographic reconstruction of HAP1 projections The IMOD packages newstack and alignframes were used to order and motion correct the tilt series as part of a custom Bash script ( Dr Mathew McLaren , University of Exeter ) , and reconstructed into a tomogram using weighted back projection with 5 Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique like filter on Etomo ( IMOD ) . Reconstructions were performed using IMOD and its Etomo interface [ 29 ] . The tomogram presented in Fig . S2 was acquired as part of the dataset reported in [ 4 ] and processed as described there . Layer line analysis and helical reconstruction Fourier transforms of 2D projection of extracted filament volumes were performed and layer line positions were measured using Fiji ( ImageJ ) . Filaments of interest were extracted from 3dmod to ImageJ to straighten the filaments and invert densities . Real space helical reconstruction was performed using dimensions ( axial rise 27 . 5 Å and subunit rotation 162° ) calculated from the layer line analysis . Cofilin - actin ( PDB - 3J0S ) and actin ( PDB - 8D17 ) were docked into helical reconstruction models in UCSF Chimera . In vitro reconstitution and cryoET Tubulin ( Cytoskeleton Inc : HTS03 - A ) and actin ( Cytoskeleton Inc : APHL99 ) were co - polymerised at 4 mg / ml and 0 . 4 mg / ml respectively in a modified TicTac buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 80 mM PIPES ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 50 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM GTP , 2 . 7 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT ) [ 16 ] at 37°C for 1 hour . Cofilin ( Cytoskeleton Inc : CF01 - A ) was added to the mixture before polymerisation at 0 . 2 mg / ml . 5 µl of the polymerised mixture was pipetted onto Quantifoil R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 copper 300 mesh grids ( Agar Scientific ) and plunge frozen in liquid ethane using a Leica EM GP plunge freezer . CryoEM grids were clipped and imaged on Talos Arctica ( FEI ) at 63 , 000x and a dose symmetric scheme with increments of 3 degrees from - 60 to 60 degrees and reconstructed as above . Platelets isolation , FIB - milling , and cryoET Platelets were isolated as described previously [ 30 ] . Briefly blood from healthy drug - free volunteers was drawn into 3 . 2 % ( w / v ) trisodium citrate according to local NHS research ethics approval ( 20 / SC / 0222 ) and the Declaration of Helsinki . Blood was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 17 min at room temperature ( RCF = 180g ) and platelet - rich plasma ( PRP ) was collected and supplemented with acidified Acid Citrate Dextrose ( ACD ) 1 / 7 ( v / v ) and apyrase ( 0 . 02 U / ml ) . Platelets were subsequently pelleted ( 1700 rpm / 10 min ) and washed with CGS ( 13mM trisodium citrate , 30mM glucose , 120mM sodium chloride ) supplemented with 0 . 02 U / ml apyrase , before resuspension in modified Hepes - Tyrodes buffer ( 145 mM NaCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 3 mM KCl , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 3 ) supplemented with 5 . 5 mM D - glucose and 0 . 02 U / ml apyrase , at a concentration of 4x10 8 platelets / ml . Quantifoil R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 gold 300 mesh grids ( Agar Scientific ) were coated with Collagen Related Peptide at 50 µg / ml overnight at room temperature and blotted off or left uncoated . We did not observe a difference between uncoated and coated samples , and so data presented are pooled sets . 5 µl of isolated platelets were pipetted onto the grids and left for 5 minutes , blotted and plunge frozen in liquid ethane using a Leica EM GP plunge freezer . CryoEM grids were clipped and screened on a Talos Arctica ( FEI ) . Focused Ion Beam milling ( FIB - milling ) was performed at eBIC on an Aquilos cryoFIB / SEM ( Thermo Fisher ) to produce lamellae at 12 degree tilts . The samples were then imaged using a Titan Krios with a Falcon 4i detector at 300 keV at 53 , 000x with a dose symmetric scheme from - 45 degrees to 69 degrees . The tomograms were reconstructed on the eBIC processing pipeline using AreTomo [ 31 ] . References 1 . Dogterom , M . and G . H . Koenderink , Actin – microtubule crosstalk in cell biology .
