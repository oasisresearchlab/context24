Insufﬁcient understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms has hindered the development of pharmacologic therapies for CAVD . Recently , we described nitric oxide ( NO ) mediated S - nitrosylation as a novel mechanism for preventing the calciﬁc process . We demonstrated that NO donor or an S - nitrosylating agent , S - nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO ) , inhibits spontaneous calciﬁcation in porcine aortic valve interstitial cells ( pAVICs ) and this was supported by single - cell RNA sequencing ( scRNAseq ) that demonstrated NO donor and GSNO inhibited myoﬁbroblast activation of pAVICs . Here , we investigated novel signaling pathways that are critical for the calciﬁcation of pAVICs that are altered by NO and GSNO by performing an in - depth analysis of the scRNA - seq dataset . Transcriptomic analysis revealed 1 , 247 differentially expressed genes in pAVICs after NO donor or GSNO treatment compared to untreated cells . Pathway - based analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed an overrepresentation of the integrin signaling pathway , along with the Rho GTPase , Wnt , TGF - β , and p53 signaling pathways . We demonstrate that ITGA8 and VCL , two of the identiﬁed genes from the integrin signaling pathway , which are known to regulate cell - extracellular matrix ( ECM ) communication and focal adhesion , were upregulated in both in vitro and in vivo calciﬁc conditions . Reduced expression of these genes after treatment with NO donor suggests that NO inhibits calciﬁcation by targeting myoﬁbroblast adhesion and ECM remodeling . In addition , withdrawal of NO donor after 3 days of exposure revealed that NO - mediated transcriptional and translational regulation is a transient event Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 01 frontiersin . org fcvm - 09 - 742850 October 19 , 2022 Time : 15 : 29 # 2 Majumdar et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2022 . 742850 and requires continuous NO exposure to inhibit calciﬁcation . Overall , our data suggest that NO and S - nitrosylation regulate the integrin signaling pathway to maintain healthy cell - ECM interaction and prevent CAVD . KEYWORDS calciﬁc aortic valve disease , nitric oxide , S - nitrosylation , single cell RNA - sequencing , integrin signaling , extracellular matrix ( ECM ) Introduction Calciﬁc aortic valve disease ( CAVD ) is deﬁned by the thickening of the aortic valve leaﬂets with the deposition of calciﬁc nodules . The estimated global prevalence of CAVD is 12 . 6 million with greater than 100 , 000 deaths per year ( 1 ) . The Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 found that newly diagnosed cases of CAVD increased ∼ 3 . 5 - fold from 1990 , with nearly 600 , 000 cases in 2019 . ( 2 ) . Despite its correlation with aging , calciﬁcation has been demonstrated to be an active disease process and not a degenerative process ( 3 ) . However , the mechanisms underlying disease progression are not clearly understood and as a result , no eﬀective therapies have been developed to prevent or cure CAVD in humans ( 4 , 5 ) . A healthy aortic valve opens and closes to its full extent during each cardiac cycle to maintain proper unidirectional blood ﬂow and prevent regurgitation . The structure and composition of the leaﬂet allow the valve to withstand the oscillating hemodynamic forces associated with each cardiac contraction . Heart valves are composed of valve endothelial cells ( VECs ) , valve interstitial cells ( VICs ) , and extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . VICs are interspersed within the ECM , and the VICs and ECM are encapsulated by a single layer of VECs . Bidirectional communication between VECs , VICs , and ECM is important for the maintenance of a healthy valve . The present and previous studies have demonstrated that VEC - derived nitric oxide ( NO ) , a second messenger molecule , is important for the inhibition of calciﬁcation in VICs ( 6 – 9 ) . VECs modulate the proliferation and diﬀerentiation of VICs to maintain a quiescent VIC phenotype by reducing the expression of α - smooth muscle actin ( α SMA ) , while the osteogenic phenotype of VICs is deﬁned by the increased expression of RUNX2 ( 9 , 10 ) . Studies have shown that porcine aortic valve interstitial cells ( pAVICs ) when cultured on stiﬀ surfaces express increased α SMA , which can be inhibited by co - culturing with porcine aortic valve endothelial cells ( pAVECs ) ( 11 ) . The addition of L - NAME , a NO synthase ( NOS ) blocker , abrogates this VEC - dependent inhibition of α SMA expression ( 11 ) . Regulation by VECs is dependent on blood ﬂow and associated shear stress , which can also regulate NO production ( 12 , 13 ) . Exposure to L - arginine , a NOS substrate , can prevent lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced bone - related alkaline phosphatase expression and calciﬁcation of collagen matrix in bovine aortic valve interstitial cells ( AVICs ) ( 14 ) . Recently , we observed NO donor can suppress both α SMA and RUNX2 expression in pAVICs ( 7 ) . In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that NO can activate NOTCH1 signaling , and loss of function mutations in NOTCH1 are associated with CAVD in humans ( 6 , 15 ) . We have also demonstrated aortic valve thickening in Notch1 haploinsuﬃcient mice in a Nos3 − / − background ( 6 , 16 ) . Recently , we described a mechanism by which NO activates NOTCH1 signaling and prevents CAVD that requires S - nitrosylation , a NO - dependent post - translational modiﬁcation of target proteins ( 7 ) . Utilizing mass spectrometric screening , we identiﬁed USP9X , a deubiquitinase , as one of the S - nitrosylated targets that can activate NOTCH1 signaling . We further demonstrated that the deletion of Usp9x from VECs and VEC - derived VICs in mice leads to thickened , calciﬁed aortic valves which are stenotic ( 7 ) . Although the involvement of the NO - dependent sGC / cGMP pathway in the inhibition of calciﬁcation of VICs has been described by others , we did not observe activation of this pathway in pAVICs culture condition after NO donor treatment ( 9 , 17 – 19 ) . To understand the molecular mechanism of NO - dependent inhibition of CAVD , we utilized in vitro pAVICs ( 6 ) . We observed spontaneous calciﬁcation of pAVICs when cultured on the stiﬀ surface of tissue culture plastic plates . This calciﬁcation was prevented when cultured in presence of NO donor and the S - nitrosylating agent , S - nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO ) ( 7 ) . Therefore , the pAVICs , cultured in presence of NO donor or GSNO represent a healthy state , whereas , the untreated cells represent a disease condition . It has been previously reported that the myoﬁbroblast activation in pAVICs is initiated by increasing the stiﬀness of the culture conditions ( 20 , 21 ) . We demonstrated NO donor and GSNO can inhibit this stiﬀness associated myoﬁbroblast activation and subsequent calciﬁcation . VICs are surrounded by ECM in vivo , and the ECM functions to maintain the proper healthy environment for VICs . We previously reported the presence of disorganized ECM with increased deposition of proteoglycan in Usp9x mutant mice , an in vivo model of CAVD Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 02 frontiersin . org fcvm - 09 - 742850 October 19 , 2022 Time : 15 : 29 # 3 Majumdar et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2022 . 742850 ( 7 ) . However , the role of NO in the regulation of ECM is not well - understood . Communication between the valve cells and ECM is critical for the optimal function of the valve . In this context , cell surface receptors play critical roles in maintaining ECM homeostasis and reduced stiﬀness . Healthy VICs are responsible for the turnover of ECM and respond to extracellular mechanical and chemical stimuli ( 22 ) . VICs communicate with the ECM through integrins and non - integrin membrane receptors , which play a regulatory role in stiﬀness - dependent calciﬁcation ( 20 , 23 ) . Integrins are transmembrane proteins comprising heterodimers of α and β subunits . Dysregulation in this integrin speciﬁcity has been observed in CAVD along with multiple other diseases including cancer , atherosclerosis , and kidney , and liver diseases ( 24 , 25 ) . Integrin receptors bind to their speciﬁc ECM partner proteins by recognizing distinct peptide sequences and blocking of this interaction has been shown to lead to calciﬁc nodule formation ( 19 ) . This suggests that the ECM - inﬂuenced calciﬁcation may be regulated by integrin - ECM interactions ( 20 ) . For example , integrin α 5 β 1 and α v β 3 , which are both minimally expressed in quiescent VICs , bind to ﬁbronectin by recognizing RGD peptide motif , but with myoﬁbroblast activation , the expression and ECM binding of both of these receptors is increased ( 20 , 25 , 26 ) . On the other hand , the 67 - kD non - integrin protein receptor interacts with the laminin - derived YIGSR peptide motif . Blocking of this interaction leads to increase calciﬁc nodule formation in pAVICs , suggesting its inhibitory role in calciﬁcation ( 20 ) . Other integrin receptors , such as α 2 β 1 bind to collagen - derived DEGA peptide motif , important for force generation in the valve leaﬂets ( 27 , 28 ) . Blocking of α 2 β 1 integrins or actin polymerization abolished force generation that suggests VIC - collagen coupling via α 2 β 1 is necessary for force generation in the valve leaﬂet ( 28 ) . In addition , elevated expression of other collagen - binding integrin receptors α 1 β 1 and α 3 β 1 were also observed in diseased valves ( 25 , 29 ) . Certain integrin - ligand interactions play important role in the initiation of osteoblast diﬀerentiation and mineralization ( 30 ) . This interaction between ECM ligands and integrin receptors initiates downstream signaling pathways by activating Ras or MAPK ( 31 ) . After binding to ECM ligands , integrin receptors transmit extracellular mechano - signals inside the cells by recruiting focal adhesion proteins , which establish the connection to the actin cytoskeleton . In addition , α - smooth muscle actin ( α SMA ; ACTA2 ) , expressed in myoﬁbroblasts allows cells to generate enhanced cellular forces , which can also be transmitted back to the ECM via integrins ( 32 ) . These mechanical forces prompt VICs to be activated and to diﬀerentiate into myoﬁbroblasts , which then secrete growth factors and also ECM components . The role of transforming growth factors ( TGF ) has been implicated in valve development and calciﬁcation ( 33 – 37 ) . Our published analysis of single - cell RNA sequencing ( scRNAseq ) data from pAVICs demonstrates that NO donor and GSNO prevent the myoﬁbroblast activation and calciﬁcation by downregulating α SMA , Vimentin , Calponin , and Transgelin expression ( 7 ) . However , our previous analysis was limited to the examination of genes that are important for myoﬁbroblast activation . We did not examine the altered cellular signaling pathways , which are modulated by NO donor or GSNO to inhibit calciﬁcation . In this report , we have analyzed scRNAseq data to identify the altered cellular signaling pathways that prevent spontaneous myoﬁbroblast activation and calciﬁcation of pAVICs in response to NO signaling . We found an overrepresentation of the integrin signaling pathway in NO donor and GSNO - treated conditions . This ﬁnding was further conﬁrmed in our recently described murine model of calciﬁcation . We also have demonstrated that altered gene expression in pAVICs after NO donor and GSNO treatment is temporary and is dependent on continuous NO exposure . Overall , our data suggest that NO and S - nitrosylation of target proteins maintain healthy VIC - ECM interactions and prevent calciﬁcation by regulation of integrin signaling pathway members . Materials and methods Porcine aortic valve interstitial cell culture and treatments Valve interstitial cells were collected from juvenile pig valve leaﬂets as previously described ( 7 ) . Brieﬂy , valve leaﬂets were digested with collagenase ( Worthington Biochemical # LS004176 ) for 5 ◦ min at 37 ◦ C and the VEC layer was removed gently with a sterile swab . After VEC layer removal , valve leaﬂets were digested with collagenase for 15 h at 37 ◦ C to dislodge VICs . Isolated pAVICs were cultured in a VIC - speciﬁc medium as previously described ( 7 ) . pAVICs were passaged with trypsin - EDTA and only cells between passages three and seven were used in this study . pAVICs were cultured on a stiﬀ surface of plastic tissue culture plates in Media - 199 ( ThermoFisher , Waltham , MA , United States , # 11150059 ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) for 5 days or as otherwise noted . To expose pAVICs to the NO donor or S - nitrosylating agent , cell culture media was supplemented with either detaNONOate ( 150 µ m ) ( FisherScientiﬁc , Pittsburgh , PA , United States , # AC328651000 ) , or S - nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO : 200 µ m ) ( MilliporeSigma , Burlington , MA , United States , # N4148 ) and was refreshed daily . To test and validate whether the eﬀect of NO is long - lasting , pAVICs were cultured for 3 days with detaNONOate ( 150 µ m ) and then without detaNONOate either for additional 2 days ( scRNAseq ) or an additional 2 , 5 , and 8 days ( Western Blot ) . This pAVICs culture condition will be designated as “NO donor Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 03 frontiersin . org fcvm - 09 - 742850 October 19 , 2022 Time : 15 : 29 # 4 Majumdar et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2022 . 742850 withdrawal . ” In this experiment 5 days culture of pAVICs with and without detaNONOate , and GSNO were utilized as control . To culture pAVICs in osteogenic media , Media 199 was supplemented with ascorbate - 2 - phosphate ( 50 µ g / ml ; Sigma - Aldrich , Burlington , MA , United States , # 49752 ) , 10 nM dexamethasone ( Sigma - Aldrich , Burlington , MA , United States , # D4902 ) , and 10 µ m β - glycerol phosphate ( Sigma - Aldrich , Burlington , MA , United States , # G9422 ) . Single - cell RNA sequencing and analyses For this study , we examined published single - cell data ( GEO accession no : GSE161123 ) . The methods for single - cell sequencing were already described previously ( 7 ) . Brieﬂy , we utilized > 85 % viable pAVICs to generate 10 × Genomics 3 (cid:48) v2 chemistry - based libraries using 10 × Genomics Chromium controller ( ∼ 2 , 000 target cell recovery / group ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . All libraries were sequenced ( 150 bp paired - end ) in the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform and 10 × Genomics’ Cell Ranger pipeline was used to demultiplex and generate FASTQ ﬁles . Data was mapped to the pig genome Sscrofa11 with Y sequences from WTSI _ X _ Y _ pig V2 ( GCF _ 000003025 . 6 _ Sscrofa11 . 1 _ genomic . fna ) and gene annotation ( GCF _ 000003025 . 6 _ Sscrofa11 . 1 _ genomic _ genes . ﬁltered . gtf ) from NCBI . 1 Cell ranger aggregate was used to combine scRNA - seq data with diﬀerent treatments ( control , GSNO , NO donor , and NO donor withdrawal ) that yield a total of 7 , 037 cells ( control : 1 , 683 , GSNO : 1966 , NO donor : 1 , 485 , and NO donor withdrawal : 1 , 903 cells ) . We recovered an average expression of 3 , 397 genes per cell . Seurat ( version 3 . 0 ) was used for data processing , identiﬁcation , and normalization of genes with the highest variability . Common diﬀerentially expressed genes among NO donor and GSNO compared to control were selected using criteria p adjusted ≤ 0 . 05 and Log 2 FC ≥ 0 . 6 or ≤ – 0 . 6 ( at least 50 % up or down - regulated genes ) . For all of the samples , the base means cut - oﬀ of 100 was utilized to ﬁlter diﬀerentially expressed genes . The volcano plot was created using ggplot2 ( 3 . 2 . 1 ) package of R . Heatmap and violin plots were created using Ryabhatta App ( 38 ) . The chord diagram was generated using http : / / www . datasmith . org online tool . PANTHER pathway analysis was performed using the functional classiﬁcation of Homo sapiens PANTHER 16 . 0 release . In addition , we imported mouse ( P30 ) aortic valve data ( 39 ) from the Gene Expression Omnibus database ( GSE117011 ) . To compare the gene expression of mouse aortic valve and pAVICs , mouse gene names were replaced with corresponding porcine homolog’s gene names downloaded from BioMart ( Ensemble 2 ) as previously described ( 7 ) . To compare the trends 1 https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / assembly / GCF _ 000003025 . 6 / 2 https : / / useast . ensembl . org / info / data / biomart / index . html in the gene expression change across diﬀerent treatments , a normalized , average expression from the four treatments was used . Normalized , average expression values for each of the 1 , 247 genes were calculated using the “AverageExpression” function of Seurat . Spearman distances were calculated for each of the pairs of culture conditions using the “Dist” function in the R package “amap” ( version 0 . 8 . 18 ) . Heatmap was drawn using the R package Pheatmap ( version 1 . 0 . 12 ) based on the distance matrix output of the Dist function . RNA puriﬁcation and quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction RNA was isolated from pAVICs using TRIzol Reagent ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , United States , # 15596018 ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Approximately 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 µ g of RNA was used for reverse transcription using SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , United States , # 11754 - 050 ) . For the quantiﬁcation of gene expression , real - time PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7 , 500 real - time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . SYBR Green - based ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc # 4385612 ) quantitative real - time ( RT ) PCR was performed to calculate mean relative gene expression after normalization of C t values to glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) using the (cid:49)(cid:49) Ct method . GAPDH has previously been utilized as a control gene for normalization in aortic valve leaﬂets ( 40 ) . All primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Data 2 . Experimental mouse model Animal experiments using mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) at the Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital . Usp9x ﬂ / ﬂ mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories , Italy , originally generated by Ozgene Pty Ltd . , Australia . Usp9x ﬂ / ﬂ female mice were bred with Tie2 Cre male mice ( Jax # 008863 ) , to generate Cre + ( experimental ) and Cre − ( control ) male ( Usp9x ﬂ / Y ; Tie2 Cre ) mice as described previously ( 7 ) . Genotyping was performed at P10 for Cre . After 6 weeks , mice were fed a high - fat western diet ( Envigo , Indianapolis , IN , United States , # TD . 88137 ) until 24 weeks of age . Prior to euthanasia , female mice underwent echocardiograms following our previously described protocol ( 7 ) . Only male mice were utilized for subsequent studies . Mice were euthanized to collect hearts for immunohistological analyses . After euthanasia , hearts were perfused with phosphate - buﬀered saline ( PBS ) , removed , and ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) at 4 ◦ C overnight . After ﬁxation , the hearts were embedded in paraﬃn and sectioned for further analysis .

Results Nitric oxide transcriptionally regulates key signaling pathways for calciﬁcation in porcine aortic valve interstitial cells We previously reported that pAVICs calcify spontaneously when cultured on a stiﬀ surface . NO and GSNO can prevent this spontaneous calciﬁcation by inhibiting the activation of myoﬁbroblast genes . To further conﬁrm our observation , we cultured pAVICs in osteogenic media for 5 days in the presence and absence of NO donor and GSNO . We observed calciﬁcation of pAVICs in osteogenic media can also be inhibited by NO donor and GSNO ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Similar to this observation , we previously reported that NO reduces the protein expression of an osteogenic marker , RUNX2 in ratAVICs , cultured in osteogenic media ( 7 ) . These observations in diﬀerent in vitro calciﬁc conditions strengthen our hypothesis that NO can inhibit valve calciﬁcation . To evaluate the NO or S - nitrosylation - dependent transcriptional regulation of cultured pAVICs , scRNAseq analysis of NO donor - treated , GSNO - treated , and untreated pAVICs was performed ( 7 ) . Since , heart valves are composed of diﬀerent cell types including subpopulations of VECs , VICs , immune cells , and melanocytes , bulk RNAseq cannot diﬀerentiate the cellular response to NO donor and GSNO ( 39 , 42 ) . However , we did not observe VECs or immune cells , or melanocytes and any separate identity of VIC - subpopulations in our pAVICs culture ( 7 ) . Our transcriptomic analysis revealed activation of several myoﬁbroblast genes in absence of NO donor and GSNO , among which ACTA2 ( α SMA ) was found to be the most signiﬁcantly upregulated gene ( 7 ) . However , this analysis was limited to the identiﬁcation of myoﬁbroblast gene activation . In this report , we have analyzed the scRNAseq data to identify altered cellular signaling pathways that are responsive to NO . Unbiased clustering of the gene expression from all of these cells using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection ( UMAP ) demonstrated three distinct populations ( Figure 1A ) . NO donor and GSNO treated pAVIC populations were similar in their cellular transcriptomic proﬁles but distinctly separate from the untreated control pAVICs . This data suggests that the NO - dependent transcriptional regulation of pAVICs is predominantly via S - nitrosylation ( Figure 1A ) based on the chemical and biological aspects of GSNO , which is considered an S - nitrosylating agent ( 43 ) . Since NO exerts its cellular activity to a greater extent via S - nitrosylation , the eﬀects of GSNO and NO donors are overlapping ( Figure 1A ) . In addition , we previously demonstrated that GSNO produces an insigniﬁcant amount of NO in pAVICs culture ( 7 ) . This observation also reduces the possibility of NO - dependent tyrosine nitration , another protein modiﬁcation that is primarily associated with the oxidative stress - dependent generation of peroxynitrite , a highly reactive nitrogen species ( RNS ) ( 44 ) . To investigate the transcriptional changes involved in calciﬁcation using this in vitro system , we evaluated common diﬀerentially expressed genes after NO and GSNO treatment compared to untreated control with p adjusted ≤ 0 . 05 and Log 2 FC ≥ 0 . 6 or ≤ – 0 . 6 ( at least 50 % increase or decrease in fold change ) . We considered diﬀerentially expressed genes after ﬁltering the expression with a base mean cut - oﬀ of 100 for all of the samples . Using these ﬁlter criteria , we obtained 1 , 247 transcripts for protein - coding genes , among them 427 were upregulated and 820 were downregulated ( Figure 1B and Supplementary Data 1 ) . PANTHER pathway analysis of these 1 , 247 genes identiﬁed 15 pathways with at least > 10 genes ( Figure 1C ) . These pathways include integrin signaling ( ITGA8 , VCL , COL1A1 , COL1A2 , ACTA2 , ACTN1 , ACTG1 ) with the maximum number of aﬀected genes , followed by Rho GTPase , Wnt ( DVL1 ) , TGF - β ( TGFB2 , TGFB3 , TGFBR2 ) , and p53 signaling pathways . Interestingly , all of these pathways have been identiﬁed to be involved in the initiation and progression of calciﬁcation and this data suggests that these pathways are regulated by NO in the setting of CAVD ( 45 – 47 ) . NO - dependent regulation of the integrin signaling pathway that regulates ECM by modulating actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions has already been demonstrated in cancer and inﬂammatory conditions ( 48 – 51 ) . The formation of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions are also regulated by Rho family GTPases , which were also identiﬁed in the PANTHER analysis ( Figure 1C ) .

Nitric oxide and S - nitrosoglutathione alters the integrin signaling pathway in porcine aortic valve interstitial cells In addition to PANTHER pathway analysis , we utilized WebGestalt ( WEB - based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit ) to evaluate overrepresented pathways based on their false discovery rate ( FDR ) ( Supplementary Figures 2A , B ; 52 ) . Interestingly we observed that the Integrin signaling pathway was the top signiﬁcantly enriched pathway with eight upregulated and 24 downregulated genes after NO donor and GSNO treatment as shown in the heatmap ( Figure 2A ) . The altered gene expression pattern between the NO donor treated and untreated control was striking while the gene expression changes after GSNO treatment demonstrated an “intermediate” pattern between these two conditions . As both NO donor and GSNO equally prevented calciﬁcation in vitro ( 7 ) , this suggested Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 07 frontiersin . org fcvm - 09 - 742850 October 19 , 2022 Time : 15 : 29 # 8 Majumdar et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2022 . 742850 that a partial rescue of the gene expression proﬁle was suﬃcient to inhibit calciﬁcation . In addition to the integrin signaling pathway , the Rho GTPase pathway was also discovered as a signiﬁcantly altered pathway ( Supplementary Figure 2B ) . As described earlier , the Rho GTPase pathway functions together with the integrin signaling pathway to modulate the response of VICs to altered ECM and vice versa in CAVD ( 45 ) . Notably , among these 32 diﬀerentially expressed genes in the integrin signaling pathway , the protein products of nine genes were identiﬁed as S - nitrosylated in VICs either calciﬁc or non - calciﬁc conditions after NO treatment ( Figure 2B ; 7 ) . To validate the involvement of the integrin signaling pathway , we evaluated the expression of three out of eight upregulated and eight out of 24 downregulated genes . These genes represent at least one - third of the identiﬁed genes of the integrin signaling pathway using quantitative RT - PCR . Expression of these genes demonstrated similar and signiﬁcant transcriptional expression as observed by scRNAseq ( Figures 2A , C ) . These genes encode for ECM proteins ( e . g . , COL1A1 , COL1A2 : collagens ) , focal adhesion proteins ( e . g . , TLN1 : talin , VCL : vinculin ) , and also integrins ( ITGA5 , ITGA8 , ITGB5 : integrins α and β subunits ) . The heterodimer of integrin β 5 ( ITGB5 ) and α v ( integrin α v β 5 ) are expressed in ﬁbroblasts and endothelial cells , whereas integrin α 8 ( ITGA8 ) and β 1 ( integrin α 8 β 1 ) are expressed in smooth muscle cells ( SMC ) ( 24 ) . The role of ITGA8 has been linked to aortic calciﬁcation in a murine model of atherosclerosis ( 53 ) . Therefore , we were particularly interested in ITGA8 expression in this study as a critical gene altered by NO . We examined the expression of Integrin α 8 ( ITGA8 ) in cultured pAVICs using immunoﬂuorescence ( Figures 2D , E ) . We observed reduced expression of ITGA8 in pAVICs after NO donor and GSNO exposure compared to untreated control , following a similar trend observed in our scRNAseq data . Interestingly , we observed upregulation of ITGB5 and downregulation of ITGA8 after NO donor and GSNO treatment suggesting that NO and GSNO inhibit the expression of SMC genes in VICs and allow VICs to maintain a more , quiescent ﬁbroblast - like phenotype ( Figure 2A ) . Overall , our data suggest that NO and S - nitrosylation - mediated modulation of the integrin signaling pathway may be associated with the progression of CAVD . Expression of integrin signaling pathway members was perturbed in the murine calciﬁc aortic valve As discussed above , a heterodimeric combination of integrins receptors determines ECM binding speciﬁcity and downstream signal transduction . Integrins recruit focal adhesion proteins , such as VCL that mechanically connect the ECM and cytoskeleton , to balance a force between cellular stress ﬁbers and ECM ( 32 ) . The role of VCL has previously been reported in both valvular and vascular endothelial morphological alignment ( 54 ) . Endothelial cells sense the hemodynamics in their environment and contribute to calciﬁcation by responding to the shear stress experienced on the cells’ apical side ( 55 ) . To test the expression of these integrin pathway genes , we combined our data with previously published scRNAseq data of mouse adult aortic valves at P30 as described previously ( 7 , 39 ) . We did not observe signiﬁcant expression of ITGA8 and VCL in healthy aortic VICs in wild - type mice ( Figure 3A ) . However , both of these genes were highly expressed in pAVICs , cultured on the stiﬀ surface , and downregulated after treatment with NO donor and GSNO ( Figure 2C ) . To test whether this increase in integrin pathway genes is speciﬁc to pAVICs in vitro culture condition or it has any in vivo relevance , we utilized our newly described CAVD murine model in which Usp9x was deleted in endothelial and endothelial - derived cells ( 7 ) . Since Usp9x is located in X - chromosome , therefore conditional deletion of the gene from endothelial and endothelial - derived VICs will be homozygous in male ( Usp9x ﬂ / Y ; Tie2 Cre + ) , and heterozygous in female ( Usp9x ﬂ / Wt ; Tie2 Cre + ) mice . Aortic velocity was measured in female mice by echocardiography , and we observed incomplete penetrance of a stenotic phenotype in these 24 weeks old mice ( p = 0 . 4498 ) ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . Therefore , Usp9x ﬂ / Wt ; Tie2 Cre + female mice were not used in this study as a model of calciﬁcation . Notably in humans , males also develop calciﬁcation more often than females ( 56 , 57 ) . We examined the expression of ITGA8 and VCL in the aortic valve of Usp9x ﬂ / Y ; Tie2Cre + murine model in comparison to Cre − control ( Figures 3B , C ) . Immunoﬂuorescence imaging demonstrated increased expression of ITGA8 in calciﬁc valves ( Figure 3B ) . Immunohistochemistry also demonstrated increased VCL expression in the aortic valve of Usp9x ﬂ / Y ; Tie2Cre + mice ( Figure 3C ) . Interestingly , higher expression of ITGA8 was observed in the myocardium of Usp9x ﬂ / Y , Tie2Cre − , compared to Usp9x ﬂ / Y , Tie2Cre + mice ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . This data indicates that elevated expression of ITGA8 is valve speciﬁc in response to calciﬁcation signaling events . Therefore , both our in vivo and in vitro observation demonstrates altered expression of integrin signaling pathway members , which suggests perturbed cell - ECM communication during CAVD . Nitric oxide - dependent integrin pathway regulation is transient Our data suggest that the eﬀect of NO on the cellular signaling pathway is dependent on the NO - mediated post - translational modiﬁcation , S - nitrosylation . S - nitrosylation is a reversible protein modiﬁcation and can initiate or inhibit cellular signaling processes . To test whether the eﬀect of NO on these signaling pathways is long - lasting , pAVICs were cultured for 3 days in presence of a NO donor , followed by culturing Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 08 frontiersin . org fcvm - 09 - 742850 October 19 , 2022 Time : 15 : 29 # 9 Majumdar et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2022 . 742850 FIGURE2 Identiﬁcation and validation of differentially expressed genes involved in integrin signaling pathway in porcine aortic valve interstitial cells ( pAVICs ) exposed to nitric oxide ( NO ) donor or S - nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO ) .

Hereafter , this pAVICs culture condition will be designated as “NO donor withdrawal . ” The scRNAseq data after NO donor withdrawal was analyzed in comparison to the transcriptomic data in the presence and absence of NO donor and GSNO for 5 days . In this study , we considered 1 , 247 identiﬁed protein - coding genes based on P - value and fold changes ( Figure 1 ) . We examined the correlative distance between each culture condition and observed the expression pattern of these 1 , 247 genes after NO donor withdrawal was similar to untreated control [ Spearman distance ( SD ) = 2 . 3 × 10 8 ] ( Figures 4A , B ) . Not surprisingly , NO donor and GSNO treatment show similar expression proﬁles ( SD = 1 . 78 × 10 8 ) . This data again is consistent with the ﬁnding that the NO - dependent transcriptional regulation in pAVICs is predominantly exerted by S - nitrosylation and this eﬀect is transient . To validate this observation in protein level , we cultured pAVICs for 3 days in presence of NO donor and then Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 10 frontiersin . org fcvm - 09 - 742850 October 19 , 2022 Time : 15 : 29 # 11 Majumdar et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2022 . 742850 FIGURE4 Nitric oxide ( NO ) - dependent transcriptional responses in porcine aortic valve interstitial cells ( pAVICs ) are short - lived .

We examined the protein expression of ITGA8 and VCL by western blot after NO donor withdrawal in comparison to untreated control , NO donor , and GSNO - treated pAVICs ( Figure 4C ) . Both ITGA8 and VCL protein expression was reduced after NO donor and GSNO treatment but increased again after NO donor withdrawal ( Figures 4C , E , F ) . Interestingly , the restoration of the expression proﬁle of a gene after NO donor withdrawal appeared to be slower at the translational level compared to the transcriptional level ( Figures 4A , C ) . This is possibly due to the reversibility of S - nitrosylation modiﬁcation , which is removed slowly from the target proteins in the absence of NO . This observation indicates that the eﬀect of NO and subsequent S - nitrosylation on keeping VICs healthy is a temporary event . Continuous NO exposure , either from endogenous or external sources is necessary to keep VICs healthy and quiescent ﬁbroblast behavior . We previously demonstrated that pAVICs undergo myoﬁbroblast activation spontaneously and NO can inhibit this Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 11 frontiersin . org fcvm - 09 - 742850 October 19 , 2022 Time : 15 : 29 # 12 Majumdar et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2022 . 742850 activation by downregulation of ACTA2 ( SMA : smooth muscle actin ) and VIM ( Vimentin ) expression at the transcriptional level ( 7 ) . Here , we found the protein expression of SMA and VIM were also reduced after NO donor and GSNO treatment compared to untreated control . Similar to integrin pathway members , SMA and VIM expression was also increased after NO donor withdrawal ( Figures 4D , G , H ) . SMA and VIM are both structural proteins important for generating forces , which are transmitted to the ECM via integrins and focal adhesion proteins . NO , and GSNO can inhibit the altered expression of ECM remodeling genes , both at the transcriptional and translational levels . Discussion In this study , we evaluated the transcriptional changes of cultured pAVICs in the presence and absence of NO donor and GSNO . Diﬀerentially expressed genes from various signaling pathways were identiﬁed in presence of NO donor and GSNO compared to untreated control . We considered 1 , 247 signiﬁcantly ( P adjusted ≤ 0 . 05 ) expressed genes with at least 1 . 5 - fold up or down - regulation for pathway enrichment analysis . Our analysis revealed the involvement of integrin , Rho GTPase , Wnt , TGF - β , and p53 signaling pathways in the process of calciﬁcation . We detected the highest number of genes involved in the integrin signaling pathway were diﬀerentially expressed after NO donor and GSNO treatments . We veriﬁed the expression of integrin pathway members and their temporal regulation by NO donor utilizing both pAVICs culture and a murine model of calciﬁcation . Overall , our study suggests that NO regulates the cell - ECM interaction by modulating the integrin pathway , which subsequently leads to calciﬁcation via dysregulated cellular signaling . With analysis of our scRNAseq data from cultured pAVICs exposed to NO donor and GSNO , we identiﬁed eight upregulated and 24 downregulated genes that encode for important components of this signaling pathway , including diﬀerent integrins , collagens , and focal adhesion proteins ( Figure 1C ) . Interestingly , the expression of these genes after GSNO treatment was in between NO donor treated and untreated control ( Figure 2A ) . This observation generates a possibility of involvement of molecular pathways other than S - nitrosylation . It is important to note that we previously demonstrated that the NO - dependent sGC / cGMP pathway is not activated in pAVICs after NO donor treatment ( 7 ) . Possibly the diﬀerences in gene expression proﬁle between NO donors and GSNO are due to diﬀerential redox status , which was not investigated and is beyond the scope of this study . In addition to S - nitrosylation , another NO - dependent post - translational modiﬁcation is tyrosine nitration , which also plays an important role in regulating protein structure and activity ( 58 – 60 ) . Nitration of tyrosine residues is classically produced by peroxynitrite , generated by the reaction of NO and oxygen radicals , associated with oxidative stress . Traditionally , it was thought to be an irreversible , degenerative process that leads to protein degradation ( 61 – 63 ) . However , there is accumulating evidence demonstrating its reversible nature in certain conditions , qualifying this modiﬁcation as an inducer of cellular signaling , similar to phosphorylation - dephosphorylation or S - nitrosylation - denitrosylation ( 58 – 60 ) . The functional role of tyrosine nitration in the context of calciﬁcation needs to be studied further . On the other hand , S - nitrosylation is an established redox - dependent reversible protein modiﬁcation , important for various cellular signaling . However , aberrant production of ROS and RNS leads to alteration in protein folding and function via dysregulated S - nitrosylation and tyrosine nitration . Dysregulation of these protein modiﬁcations is already implicated in aging , cancer , diabetes , and also neurodegenerative , cardiovascular , pulmonary and musculoskeletal diseases ( 64 , 65 ) . Therefore , a regulated balance of NO production and cellular redox status is required to propagate healthy cell - ECM interaction . We veriﬁed similar changes in the expression of integrins ( e . g . , ITGA8 ) and focal adhesion proteins ( e . g . , VCL ) in the murine calciﬁed aortic valve , as observed in scRNAseq ( Figures 2 , 3 ) . Previously we described thickened and stenotic aortic valve with a disorganized matrix in Usp9x ﬂ / ﬂ ; Tie2 - Cre + mouse ( 7 ) . It is well - known that the production of NO by endothelial NOS is dependent on blood ﬂow ( 12 , 13 ) . It can be speculated that thickened valve leaﬂets would initiate disturbed blood ﬂow patterns across the valve , which would also lead to perturbed NO production . Since NO is a freely diﬀusible molecule , but short - lived , it cannot travel from the endothelial cells to the interstitial cells located far ( aortic side ) from the laminar shear ﬂow side ( ventricular side ) in the thickened valve . It is notable that the aortic side of the aortic valve experience oscillatory shear ﬂow ( 66 ) . We previously demonstrated that S - nitrosylation is predominantly present in the ventricular side of the aortic valve and the atrial side of the mitral valve , both of which experience the laminar shear ﬂow ( 7 ) . Therefore , we suggest that the perturbed blood ﬂow through the thickened and stenotic aortic valve in our murine model of CAVD leads to insuﬃcient NO production , followed by perturbation of the integrin signaling pathway and ECM turnover in VICs . Integrins demonstrate binding speciﬁcity toward various ECM proteins and transduce intracellular signals . This signaling is determined by the ECM composition and stiﬀness , which regulate cellular phenotypes ( 24 ) . We observed diﬀerential expression of integrin genes ( ITGA3 , 5 and 8 ) between control and NO - treated pAVICs ( Figure 1C ) . The protein product of these three genes heterodimerizes with integrin β 1 . All of these integrin heterodimers α 3 β 1 , α 5 β 1 , and α 8 β 1 play important roles in promoting myoﬁbroblast activation and developing ﬁbrotic conditions ( 67 – 70 ) . In addition , we observed diﬀerential expression of various collagens ( COL1A1 , COL1A2 , Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 12 frontiersin . org fcvm - 09 - 742850 October 19 , 2022 Time : 15 : 29 # 13 Majumdar et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2022 . 742850 COL15A1 , COL6A3 , COL5A1 ) ( Supplementary Figure 2A ) , which constitutes the largest fraction of the ECM , both in the valve and in the myocardium . After binding to ECM , integrins interact with the cytoskeleton via focal adhesion proteins , which were also diﬀerentially expressed ( VCL , TLN1 ) after NO and GSNO treatment ( Figure 1C ) . Interestingly , two collagens ( COL1A1 , COL1A2 ) , which were transcriptionally downregulated ( Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 2A ) were also S - nitrosylated in the non - calciﬁc condition after NO donor treatment ( Figure 2B ) . This data suggests a possible feedback inhibition of ECM genes at the transcriptional level by S - nitrosylation . However , the mechanism of this feedback regulation requires further investigation . In addition , changes in the expression of the cytoskeletal genes including ACTA2 , ACTN1 , and ACTG1 ( Figure 1C ) were observed after NO donor and GSNO treatment . The cytoskeletal response toward ECM is mediated by the Rho family of GTPases , which were also diﬀerentially expressed ( RHOB , RAC1 ) in NO donor and GSNO - treated cells ( Figure 1C ) . Intracellular forces generated by the actin cytoskeleton are transmitted back to the ECM to alter its organization . This triggers the activation of TGF - β , which can further promote myoﬁbroblast activation ( 71 ) . TGF - β also regulates the Wnt signaling pathway by repressing GSK3 β , which results in the degradation of cytoplasmic β - catenin in cooperation with disheveled ( DVL ) . We found diﬀerential expression of TGF - β and Wnt pathway genes ( TGFB2 , TGFB3 , TGFBR2 , DVL1 ) ( Figure 1C and Supplementary Data 1 ) , which have well - established roles in cardiac development and disease ( 47 , 72 ) . Overall , our scRNAseq analysis indicates that NO can globally regulate intracellular signaling pathways in VICs and its extracellular communication with ECM to maintain healthy VICs . Healthy VICs reﬂect a quiescent ﬁbroblast type which becomes activated to a myoﬁbroblast - like state when cultured on a stiﬀ surface of a tissue culture plate ( 20 , 21 , 73 ) . We have demonstrated that NO donor and GSNO can inhibit the myoﬁbroblast activation of pAVICs ( 7 ) . However , it is not clear whether activated pAVICs can diﬀerentiate back to a ﬁbroblast - like state . Interestingly , we observed increased expression of TCF21 , a cardiac ﬁbroblast marker after NO donor exposure ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . It has been demonstrated before that S - nitrosylation and TCF21 + cells are present predominantly in the laminar shear ﬂow side ( ventricular side ) of the healthy aortic valve ( 7 , 39 ) . This data indicates a possible correlation between NO - mediated S - nitrosylation and the maintenance of a healthy ﬁbroblast - type state deﬁned by TCF21 expression . An increase of TCF21 in presence of NO ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) also indicates that NO can reverse the myoﬁbroblast toward a ﬁbroblast - type state in an in vitro setting . Further studies are required to determine if there is a reduction of TCF21 + cells in the aortic valve of murine models of CAVD . Analysis of our scRNAseq data revealed that NO - dependent regulation of the integrin signaling pathway is important for the communication between cells and ECM . However , cultured pAVICs on tissue culture plates do not have a proper ECM . Therefore , the eﬀect of ECM remodeling during the progression of calciﬁcation cannot be identiﬁed in this in vitro condition , which is a major drawback of this model system . Although we veriﬁed the expression of some genes in vivo mouse model , the conclusion of this study is limited to the identiﬁcation of altered cellular signaling pathways and gene expression , which are related to cell - ECM interaction . It has previously been reported that myoﬁbroblast activation and calciﬁcation of pAVICs are inﬂuenced by the stiﬀness of the culture plates , which possibly mimics the very advanced stages of CAVD ( 21 , 74 , 75 ) . Interestingly , NO donor and GSNO can prevent this myoﬁbroblast activation and calciﬁcation of pAVICs , cultured on a stiﬀ surface . This eﬀect of NO donor and GSNO on the pAVICs is transcriptional and not inﬂuenced by the stiﬀness of its culture condition . This generates the possibility of therapeutic agents , which can continuously produce NO , and would have the potential to preserve the healthy status of VICs . This puts NO donors and GSNO as potential therapeutic agents which may ﬁx or decelerate the progression of CAVD by altering diseased VICs and ECM via regulation of integrin and other involved signaling pathways .

Insuﬃcient bioavailability of NO leads to dysregulated integrin signaling , ECM turnover , and remodeling , which generates mechanical forces both by ECM and VICs . These mechanical forces induce dysregulation of multiple downstream cellular pathways , including the TGF - β and Wnt pathways contributing to aortic valve calciﬁcation ( Figure 5 ) .
