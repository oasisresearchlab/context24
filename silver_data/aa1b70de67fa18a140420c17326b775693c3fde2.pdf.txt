Social contact data provide 3 information on the interaction of people in a population whereas the value of time use data lies in the 4 quantification of exposure patterns . Both have been used as proxies for transmission risks within in a 5 population and the combination of both sources has led to investigate which kind of social encounters are 6 most relevant to describe transmission risk . 7 Methods : We used social contact and time use data from 1707 participants from a survey conducted 8 in Flanders , Belgium in 2010 - 2011 . We calculated weighted exposure time and social contact matrices 9 to analyze age - and gender - specific mixing patterns and to quantify behavioral changes by distance from 10 home . We compared the value of both data sources , individually and combined , for explaining seropreva - 11 lence and incidence data on parvovirus - B19 , Varicella - Zoster virus ( VZV ) and influenza - like illnesses ( ILI ) , 12 respectively . 13 Results : Assortative mixing and inter - generational interaction is more pronounced in the exposure matrix 14 due to the high proportion of time spent at home . This pattern is less pronounced in the social contact 15 matrix , which is more impacted by the reported contacts at school and work . The average number of 16 contacts declined with distance , however on the individual - level , we observed an increase in the number of 17 contacts and the transmission potential by distance when travelling . 18 We found that both social contact data and time use data provide a good match with the seroprevalence 19 and incidence data at hand . When comparing the use of different combinations of both data sources , 20 we found that the social contact matrix based on close contacts of at least 4 hours appeared to be the 21 best proxy for parvovirus - B19 transmission . Social contacts and exposure time were both on their own 22 able to explain VZV seroprevalence data though combining both scored best . Compared with the contact 23 approach , the time use approach provided the better fit to the ILI incidence data . 24 Conclusions : Our work emphasises the common and complementary value of time use and social contact 25 data for analysing mixing behavior and infectious disease transmission . We derived spatial , temporal , age - , 26 gender - and distance - specific mixing patterns , which are informative for future modelling studies . 27 Keywords : Infectious disease dynamics , mixing patterns , exposure matrices , spatial dynamics , time use , 28 missing data , GAMLSS , SEIR model , POLYMOD . 29 1 .

Background 30 Infectious diseases have substantial impact on public health and economy and warrant constant monitoring 31 and follow - up . Initially , disease transmission models relied on untested assumptions about “at risk events” . 32 In recent years , the models have been informed by data from social contact surveys such as POLYMOD [ 1 ] in 33 which participants had to report about their contact behavior by age , gender , frequency , etc . Social contact 34 patterns have been successfully used as proxies for transmission of close - contact diseases , such as influenza 35 and mumps , under the so called social contact hypothesis [ 2 ] . The use of social contact data helps estimating 36 key epidemiological parameters [ 3 , 4 ] , behavioral changes [ 5 , 6 , 7 ] and demographic change [ 8 ] in the context 37 of disease transmission . The number of social contact surveys to collect empirical data on human contact 38 behavior has increased substantially over recent years [ 9 ] . 39 40 Time use data have also proven their value for explaining infectious disease data using the time use approach 41 in which mixing patterns can be estimated from the time spent at a given location [ 10 , 11 , 12 ] . The reported 42 presence over time at different locations during a day enables the estimation of the exposure time among age 43 groups [ 12 ] . The notion of co - presence is complementary to reported social contacts , hence time use data are 44 useful to capture “at risk events” that fall outside the definition of a social contact . 45 46 The integration of both the “time use approach” and the “social contact approach” has lead to estimation 47 of “suitable contacts” [ 11 ] . De Cao et al . [ 11 ] showed that the interplay between exposure time and social 48 contacts appeared to be important to study the transmission of Varicella - Zoster virus ( VZV ) whereas the 49 transmission dynamics of parvovirus - B19 was best captured using only exposure time . This study was based 50 on two independent surveys . 51 52 Contact dispersal is of essence to capture disease transmission dynamics , though a systematic review of social 53 contacts surveys [ 9 ] revealed that only a limited number of contact studies investigated the relationship be - 54 tween contacts and distance . Disease counts have been modeled using power law dispersal kernels [ 13 , 14 , 15 ] , 55 though questions remain whether this also holds for social mixing behavior . A study in Great Britain [ 16 ] 56 collected information on the distance from home for each contact and observed a decrease in contact duration 57 with increasing distance from home . In addition , age - specific contact patterns and temporal differences with 58 respect to weekdays and weekends have been described [ 9 ] , but gender - specific behavior in social mixing is less 59 reported , though could contribute to the parameterisation of mathematical transmission models [ 17 , 18 , 19 ] . 60 61 In this work , we use data from a comprehensive survey to compare the social contact , time use and suitable 62 contact approach . An important element in this survey [ 19 ] is the recording of the distance from home for 63 every reported location in the time use survey . In particular , we ( 1 ) compared mixing patterns based on 64 time use and social contact data , and explored covariates such as age , gender , location , etc . ; ( 2 ) analysed 65 social mixing patterns and estimated basic reproduction numbers by distance from home ; ( 3 ) evaluated the 66 value of time use and social contact data to explain seroprevalence data for VZV and parvovirus - B19 , and 67 influenza - like illness ( ILI ) incidence data in Belgium . 68 2 .

We first introduce each data set and continue with the methods to handle missing data and 71 uncertainty . Next , we describe how we analysed exposure time and social contact data and calculated mixing 72 matrices . We end with the integration and evaluation of different mixing patterns in epidemiological models 73 for VZV , parvovirus - B19 and ILI incidence data from Belgium . 74 Data 75 This study is based on a diary - based survey on social contacts and time use , which was conducted between 76 September 2010 and February 2011 in Flanders , Belgium . The general description of this data can be found in 77 [ 19 ] and the dataset is available online within the social contact data sharing initiative [ 20 ] and the SOCRATES 78 platform [ 21 ] . The final sample size used for the analysis in this work is 1707 participants , as in [ 19 ] . 79 80 To record time use , participants were asked to indicate for pre - defined time slots the location at which they 81 spent most of their time . Location types were pre - defined ( home , kindergarden , school , workplace , transport , 82 family , leisure and other ) and the options were adapted to the age of the participant . For example “kindergar - 83 den” was only used for surveying children and “workplace” only for adults . We also questioned the distance 84 from home for each location in four categories ( 0 - 1 km , 2 - 9 km , 10 - 74 km or 75 km or more ) . Time slots were 85 mostly of 1 - hour length , except in the morning ( 2 - 5h , 5 - 8h ) and in the evening ( 20 - 22h , 22 - 24h , 24h - 2h ) . With 86 respect to missing data , 1486 participants ( 87 % ) provided full information on their location and distance from 87 home for each time - slot , and 49 participants provided no time use data at all . 88 89 Seroprevalence data was used from the Belgian sero - survey in 2001 - 2003 on parvovirus - B19 and VZV . In total , 90 3080 sera were tested for parvovirus - B19 and 3256 sera were tested for VZV , from which 2975 sera were tested 91 for both VZV and parvovirus - B19 . The sero - survey involved participants ranging from 0 to 71 . 5 years of age . 92 More information is provided in Hens et al [ 22 ] . 93 94 The ILI incidence data were collected from a network of general practitioners ( GPs ) in Belgium . The GPs 95 in the network were asked to report the weekly number of ILI by 7 age groups : < 1 , 1 - 4 , 5 - 14 , 15 - 19 , 20 - 64 , 96 65 - 84 , ≥ 85 years . The data were provided by the Scientific Institute of Public health . More details of the 97 data are described in [ 23 ] and [ 24 ] . 98 Analysis 99 Missing data 100 Missing values in the time use data were treated as “Missing at Random” [ 25 ] . As such , we assumed a sys - 101 tematic relationship between the propensity of missing values and the observed data , but not with the missing 102 data . Missing data were imputed by using Multivariate Imputation via Chained Equations ( MICE ) [ 26 ] . The 103 list of variables included in the imputation model can be found in Additional file 1 Table S3 . By applying 104 MICE with different random number generator seeds , we obtained 10 imputed data sets . Please note that for 105 3 .

We created 1000 bootstrap replicates for each 111 imputed data set ( M = 10 ) , resulting in 10000 data sets [ 27 ] ( See Additional file 1 for more details ) . 112 Participant weights 113 Participant contributions to mixing patterns were weighted to account for sampling probabilities based on 114 the joint distribution of age , household size and day type ( holiday / regular periods and weekday / weekend ) . 115 We used census data for Belgium from 2011 ( http : / / epp . eurostat . ec . europa . eu ) as reference population and 116 weights were constrained to a maximum of 3 to reduce the impact of the corresponding observations . 117 Time use patterns 118 We explored time use patterns by calculating the proportion of time at each location as reported by partici - 119 pants . To limit data sparseness , we combined “kindergarten” with “school” , and also “family” and “leisure” 120 with “other” . Reported proportions were analysed in relationship with age , gender , weekday / weekend , period 121 ( regular / holiday ) , health state ( ill or not ill ) and family status . The latter was only relevant for adults be - 122 tween 25 and 65 years of age and defined as living with or without children less than 13 years old . We used 123 7 age categories in line with the Belgian education and employment system ; 0 - 2 years , 3 - 5 years , 6 - 11 years , 124 12 - 17 years , 18 - 44 years , 45 - 64 years and 65 - 90 years of age . We also performed an additional analysis of the 125 reported locations using 5 - year age groups to study gender - specific differences in time use ( refer to Additional 126 file 2 Figure 2 ) . 127 128 The proportion of time spent at different locations during one day can be analysed as compositional data . 129 This is a special type of multivariate data , with each proportion being non - negative and the total sum adding 130 up to one . A divergence based regression modelling technique is used to explore time use at each location [ 28 ] . 131 More specifically , we used Kullback - Leibler divergence to minimize the distance between the observed and 132 the fitted compositions with respect to the coefficients of the regression ( Additional file 3 ) . We used the 133 10000 datasets generated through MICE and bootstrapping to construct weighted confidence intervals for all 134 parameter estimates [ 29 ] . 135 136 Contact patterns taking into account time use and distance 137 We used a GAMLSS model [ 30 ] for analysing the determinants of social contact patterns , while taking into 138 account the time spent at each location as explanatory variables . To handle classification issues in this sub - 139 analysis , we aggregated all location types into “home” , “work” , “school” and “other” . 140 141 4 .

Participants were able to report multiple distances for one location type 143 over different time - slots in the time use part . For example , one could report “other” at 2 km and 10 km from 144 home , for shopping in the morning and sport activities in the evening . As such , we applied a probabilistic 145 link procedure between a social contact and the distance from home , based on the relative time spent at 146 each distance per location type . The interaction between travel and social contact patterns has been studied 147 unconditionally and conditionally upon presence at each distance , i . e . , the former presents the population 148 average and the latter is in line with the individual - level perspective . To elaborate on social contact dispersal , 149 we classified participants by age using a cutoff of 18 years ( child and adult ) , gender and type of day ( regular 150 weekday , weekend , holiday ) . We excluded the contacts with missing distance ( ± 7 % ) to calculate the weighted 151 average number of contacts by distance and by age , gender and day type . 152 Social contact matrices and R 0 153 The matrix M dt , representing the mean number of contacts at distance d during one day of type t , can be estimated by the following expression : m dtij = (cid:80) P i p = 1 w p y dtijp (cid:80) P i p = 1 w p , ( 1 ) where P i is the number of participants in age class i , w p the weight for participant p and y dtijp the reported number of contacts made by participant p of age class i with someone of age class j at distance d during one day of type t . The social contact matrix c ij , representing the per capita daily contact rate between age classes , was calculated as c ij = m ij N j ( 2 ) with N j the population size in age class j , obtained from census data . 154 155 The next generation matrix G with elements g ij indicates the average number of secondary infections in age class i through the introduction of a single infectious individual of age class j into a fully susceptible population [ 31 ] . Assuming a rectangular population age - distribution , the next generation matrix at distance d during one day of type t is defined by : G dt = ND L C dt q , ( 3 ) with N the population size , D the mean duration of infectiousness , L the life expectancy , C dt the contact 156 matrix at distance d during one day of type t and q the proportionality factor . The basic reproduction number 157 R 0 can be calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix . To enable the comparison of 158 transmission dynamics by distance , we needed to specify the disease - specific q parameter of equation ( 3 ) . As 159 such , we constrained the average R 0 for regular weekdays using all reported contacts from the bootstrapped 160 and imputed data sets to 2 . 161 162 5 .

As such , for one single location and time slot of the survey 165 day , we calculated the exposure time of a participant to the other participants proportionally to their relative 166 participation in that location . We used 17 categories ; 0 - 2 years , 3 - 5 years , 6 - 11 years , 12 - 17 years , 18 - 25 years , 167 5 - year age categories between 25 and 80 years of age , and a closing category of 80 - 90 years of age . Participants 168 had to report their household members in terms of age , gender and whether they were present at home during 169 the survey day . This allowed us to compute the time of exposure between members of the same household , 170 which is formalized in the matrix H . 171 172 For locations other than home , the exposure time between people in age group i and j at specific location l and time slot s , t lsij , can be computed under the PTM assumption as follows : t lsij = k lsi k lsj k ls . d s , ( 4 ) where k lsi and k lsj are the number of people present at location l during time slot s in age group i and j , respectively , k ls . is the sum over all age classes at location l during time slot s and d s is the duration of each time slot s in hours . From ( 4 ) , we can compute the time of exposure between people in age group i and in age group j , referred to as matrix T , as follows : t ij = S (cid:88) s = 1 L (cid:88) l = 1 k lsi k lsj k ls . d s , ( 5 ) The sum of T and H determines the overall exposure time matrix E , with elements e ij : e ij = t ij + h ij . ( 6 ) The response matrix E contains non - negative quantities that are considered to follow a mixed discrete - 173 continuous distribution , comprising value Y = 0 with probability p 0 and value Y = Y 1 ∈ ( 0 , ∞ ) with probability 174 ( 1 - p 0 ) . The R package gamlss . inf [ 32 ] was used to model E . For the discrete part ( zero or not ) , we created a 175 binary response variable to fit a binary logistic model . We explored different distributions for the continuous 176 part ( Y > 0 ) such as Gamma , Inverse Gaussian , Inverse Gamma , Log - normal , Weibull and Pareto . Partici - 177 pants weights were taken into account and model selection was based on the Akaike information criterion ( AIC ) . 178 179 Suitable contact matrices 180 The “suitable contact” approach assumes that not all social contacts are informative for disease transmission and that long duration and more intimate contacts are more likely to be relevant . To construct suitable contact matrices , we followed the procedure of De Cao et al . [ 11 ] , which considered contacts and exposure between age classes i and j ( c ij and e ij , respectively ) . Let u ij be a random variable representing the number 6 .

Then the expected number of suitable contacts is given by the product of the average number of contacts c ij and the proportion of these contacts that are relevant for transmission 1 − exp ( − e ij / c ij ) where exp ( − e ij / c ij ) is the Poisson probability that a contact is not suitable . Therefore the probability of infection β i , j is given by β ij = q 1 u ij , ( 7 ) where q 1 is a constant disease - specific transmission coefficient and 181 u ij = c ij ( 1 − exp ( − q 2 e ij / c ij ) ) , ( 8 ) with q 2 the fraction of total exposure time between age groups that is relevant for transmission . 182 183 Fitting mixing matrices to serological data for parvovirus - B19 and VZV 184 The social contact and the time use approach rely on the assumption that infectious disease transmission 185 between people in different age categories is proportional to their number and duration of their physical 186 encounters , respectively . To complement the age - specific social contact and exposure time matrices within a 187 transmission model framework , we estimated q 1 and q 2 from Equation 7 and 8 to capture the reported disease 188 prevalence under endemic equilibrium . We used a transmission model for VZV based on Maternally - derived 189 immunity , Susceptible , Infectious and Recovered infection states ( MSIR ) [ 3 , 11 , 33 ] . For parvovirus - B19 , we 190 used an MSIRWb model [ 33 ] , which is an MSIR model augmented with waning immunity and boosting in the 191 Recovered compartment . In both models , and without loss of generality , we assumed newborns to be fully 192 protected by maternal antibodies until 6 months of age [ 33 ] , after which they become susceptible . 193 Fitting mixing matrices to influenza - like illnesses ( ILI ) incidence data 194 We used an age - structured Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered ( SEIR ) model with different mixing 195 matrices to capture the Belgian ILI incidence in 2010 - 2011 . The weekly ILI incidence was recorded by the 196 general practitioners ( GPs ) network , which covered 1 . 75 % of the population in Belgium [ 23 , 24 ] . Because we 197 only considered one season ( 52 weeks from week 40 in 2010 to week 39 in 2011 ) , newborns and mortality are not 198 included in the model ( see Additional file 5 for more details of the model description and parameters ) . We used 199 an average latent period of 1 day and an average infectious period of 3 . 8 days based on the literature [ 34 , 35 ] . 200 We estimated the model parameters by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the observed ILI 201 incidence rate and the predicted incidence rates . The following parameters were estimated : age - specific and 202 proportionality factors q i based on the social contact hypothesis [ 2 ] and a scaling factor . The scaling factor is 203 used to align the predicted incidence rates to the observed incidence rates , which accounts for those individuals 204 with influenza who do not seek medical attention ( the consultation rate ) [ 34 , 35 , 36 ] . 205 7 .

People older than 45 years of age accounted for the highest proportion of missing 209 data for at least one time slot ( Table 1 ) . People spent on average about two thirds of their day at home . 210 The elderly over 65 years of age and children less than 6 years old reported the highest proportion of time 211 spent at home . For the active population , we observed that time at work is higher for males than for females , 212 hence the opposite is observed for time spent at home . Temporal factors such as day of the week and holiday 213 periods had a large impact on time use . 214 Health status was also linked to substantial changes in participants’ time use . Participants did report an 215 increase of 5 hours at home when feeling ill and almost no time at work . However , the time spent at other 216 locations is still substantial when people reported feeling ill . Adults between 25 to 65 years of age living with 217 children under 13 years of age reported more time spent at home compared to those without children . 218 219 We analysed the reported time at work more in detail and observed that the average time is similar for males 220 and females until the age of 30 years ( Additional file 2 Figure S1 ) . Differences emerge from the age of 30 221 years , in which females reported on average less time at work compared to males in the same age group . We 222 observed the highest differences in age groups [ 40 , 45 ) , [ 50 , 55 ) and [ 55 , 60 ) in which males reported 10 % more 223 time at work compared to females . The reported time at work declined after 65 years of age for both genders . 224 The time spent at “other” places was similar between males and females in general , except for the age cat - 225 egories [ 6 , 12 ) and [ 18 , 25 ) in which males reported 6 % more compared to females . The reported time for 226 transport was similar for males and females . 227 228 We analysed the time use patterns with a divergence - based regression model with multinomial logit link 229 function including gender , age , day type and period . Table 2 shows all parameter estimates and 95 % confidence 230 intervals . After controlling for age and temporal factors , time at work reported by males is significantly higher 231 compared to females . In reverse , females reported more time at home than males . The gender - specific 232 difference in time spent at school was not statistically significant . Age had a significant effect on presence at 233 home , school and work but not on the reported time at location category “other” . As expected , temporal 234 factors played a crucial role in the time use patterns , particularly on the presence at work and school . We also 235 observed a clear increase in the reported time in the “other” category during weekends vs . regular weekdays . 236 This denotes compensation behavior of people not at work or at school , which needs to be considered when 237 modeling weekend days . 238 Social contacts patterns taking into account time use 239 We analysed the number of reported social contacts with a zero - inflated negative binomial model and observed 240 that the overall number of contacts was inversely associated with the time spent at home , and positively 241 associated with the time spent at school or work ( Table 3 ) . The number of contacts at school or work tends to 242 increase with the time spent in these settings . We observed a gender effect , implying that males tend to have 243 on average fewer contacts compared to females per time - unit . However , there was no statistical difference in 244 8 .

With respect to age , the highest 245 overall number of contacts were observed among children up to 18 years of age and among people in the 246 working age ( 25 - 65 years of age ) . The age effect was not observed for the social contacts at home and school , 247 but observed for the social contacts at other places . 248 Household size was positively associated with the total number of contacts , contacts at home and other places , 249 however household size showed no significant effect on the social contacts at school and at work . The reported 250 class size did not have a clear effect on the number of school contacts . As expected , we observed an explicit 251 link between temporal factors and the number of school and work contacts . 252 253 Social contact dispersal 254 To explore social contact dispersal , we analyzed the social contact data by distance in combination with age , 255 gender and type of day ( Figure 1 ) . At population level , i . e . unconditional upon whether or not people travel , 256 we observed most contacts for children ( 0 - 18 years of age ) in the category 0 - 9 km from home during week - 257 days and very few contacts beyond 10 km from home . This pattern was the same for boys or girls . During 258 weekends , children reported a decline in the number of contacts by distance , but less so for girls . For adults 259 ( 18 + years of age ) , we observed an increase by distance on weekdays up to 10 - 75 km from home . On average , 260 people reported almost no contacts 75 + km from home . Females reported more contacts up to 9 km from 261 home compared to males , though the opposite holds for the category 10 - 74 km . For weekends , we observed a 262 decline in the number of contacts beyond 10 km from home , both for males and females . 263 264 The conditional results , i . e . looking at the number of contacts upon having traveled a certain distance , showed 265 a different result compared to the unconditional ( or population based ) results . For children , the conditional 266 results for weekdays show a clear maximum in the category 2 - 9 km from home . The number of contacts at 267 10 - 74 km from home equals the number of contacts close to home . During weekends , the reported number of 268 contacts for girls increased with distance though the social contact behavior for boys seemed indifferent with 269 distance up to 74 km . For adults , the number of social contacts during weekdays at 2 - 9 km and 10 - 74 km 270 from home was two and three times the number of reported contacts at home , respectively . Also for the last 271 distance category ( 75 + km from home ) , we observed an increase compared to the contacts at home but with 272 large uncertainty . If adults leave home during weekends , the reported number of contacts by adults seems 273 indifferent to the distance up to 74 km . Only at 75 + km from home , females reported fewer social contacts , 274 compared to males . In conclusion , the number of contacts decreased by distance at population level , though 275 if people made the effort to go somewhere , they made it count in terms of social encounters . 276 277 Transmission dispersal and R 0 278 The social contact dispersal as illustrated in Figure 1 induces distinct transmission potential by distance . 279 We calculated social contact matrices by distance for child / adult interactions for each bootstrapped data set 280 ( e . g . , Additional file 4 Figure S4 and S5 ) and corresponding R 0 values . We calibrated the disease - specific 281 proportionally factor q for a flu - like disease with median R 0 = 2 with the full set of social contact data from 282 regular weekdays . The successive R 0 values using distance - specific contact data should be interpreted as 283 9 .

On the population level , the transmission 284 potential slightly increased until 74 km from home during regular weekdays . This can be explained by the 285 strong assortative mixing 2 - 9 km from home and the work - related mixing between adults 10 - 74 km from home 286 ( Additional file 4 Figure S4 ) . The overall reduction in the transmission potential during weekends , can be 287 explained by the fewer number of contacts for the distance category 10 - 74 km from home . Social contacts at 288 75 + km from home had almost no impact on the unconditional transmission potential . 289 290 The transmission potential conditional upon presence showed a clear increase with distance from home during 291 regular weekdays ( Figure 2 ) . This effect was similar for weekends , however with a decrease of the estimated 292 R 0 for the last distance category . In general , the estimated transmission potential increased by distance from 293 an individual - based perspective . 294 Exposure time and social contact matrices 295 We used a zero - adjusted log - normal model on the time use data to estimate the age - specific exposure matrices . 296 The resulting exposure matrix reflected contributions from exposure at home , school , work , and other locations 297 ( Figure 3 ) . The main diagonal indicates that people tend to spend time with people of similar age . The two 298 sub - diagonals represent the mixing pattern between generations . We also calculated the corresponding social 299 contact matrix representing the weighted average number of contacts by age . Both matrices showed strong 300 assortative mixing by age , especially for young children and teenagers . Especially the exposure matrix showed 301 strong interaction among family members , as a result of the reported time at home . This pattern is very clear 302 in the location - specific exposure matrix at home ( Additional file 3 Figure S1 ) . 303 Time reported at home constituted on average up to ± 66 % of the total time per day , while contacts at home 304 only accounted for ± 18 % of the total number of contacts . In contrast , the impact of employment is higher 305 for the contact matrix compared to the exposure matrix ( ± 40 % of the total number of contacts though only 306 ± 9 % of total time per day ) . We observed more pronounced assortative mixing pattern in the same - gender 307 matrices for children and teenagers ( Figure 4 ) , though more different - gender exposure time for adults older 308 than 50 years of age . In addition , the interaction between mothers and daughters seemed more pronounced 309 compared to other child - adult interactions . 310 10 .

Model 313 estimations were compared to serological data and model selection was based on the AIC criterion . The over - 314 all time use matrix implied a better fit for both parvovirus - B19 and VZV compared to total social contact 315 matrix . When exploring different levels of intimacy , location and duration , the social contact matrix based on 316 close contacts lasting more than 4 hours , provided the best proxy for the transmission dynamics of parvovirus - 317 B19 ( Additional file 5 Table S2 and S3 ) . For VZV , the social contact matrix based on close contacts of at 318 least 1 hour did improve the contact approach , though the AIC was still higher compared to the time use 319 approach . 320 321 The suitable contact approach , which accounts for both the number of social contacts and exposure time , 322 scored slightly better for parvovirus - B19 compared to the contact approach , but not better in comparison 323 to the time use approach . For VZV , the application of suitable contact estimates provided the overall best 324 fit with the lowest AIC . The estimated proportionality factor q 2 of exposure data with respect to the overall 325 model prediction is much higher for VZV ( 0 . 94 ) than for parvovirus - B19 ( 0 . 13 ) , which implied a higher number 326 of suitable contacts for transmission of VZV . Our best - fitting models estimated a reproduction number of 1 . 9 327 [ 1 . 7 ; 2 . 1 ] and 7 . 8 [ 6 . 8 ; 8 . 5 ] for parvovirus - B19 and VZV , respectively . The estimated prevalence and force 328 of infection by the 3 approaches were quite similar ( Figure 5 ) . We did observe differences in the predicted 329 age - specific relative incidence by the time use and social contact approaches ( Figure 6 ) . The highest relative 330 incidence obtained by the social contact approach was among children in the age group [ 12 , 18 ) , while the 331 highest relative incidence obtained by the time use approach is among children of [ 6 - 12 ) years . The latter also 332 predicts a relatively higher incidence in adults between 35 and 50 years of age . 333 Fitting social contact and exposure time matrices to ILI incidence data 334 Social contact and exposure time matrices were used to compute transmission rates in the dynamic , differential - 335 equation SEIR model for ILI incidence data . The model comparison was based on the least square score , a 336 direct measure of goodness of fit with smaller values indicating a better fit to the ILI incidence data . The 337 intimacy and duration of contacts seemed to matter for the ILI transmission modelling , such that physical 338 contacts and contacts lasting at least 1 hour provided most information regarding transmission dynamics . 339 The exposure time matrices provided a better fit for ILI compared to the total contact matrix ( Additional 340 file 5 Table S4 ) . R 0 estimated from the Based on the best scoring model , we estimated the R 0 to be 1 . 43 341 with scaling factor of 0 . 266 . The combination of contact and exposure time matrices did not improve the fit . 342 Figure S1 ( Additional file 5 ) shows the fit of different matrices to ILI incidence rate . The estimated incidence 343 rates from models using suitable contact matrices and exposure time matrices are almost overlapping , with 344 only a slight difference at the seasonal peaks of transmission . 345 Figure 7 shows the fit of the models based on the contact and exposure time matrices for the total population 346 and different age groups . For each ( sub ) model , we present the least square value , the observed number and 347 modeled based estimates of ILI cases , their ratio , and the mean absolute error ( MAE ) . For the total population , 348 the estimated ILI cases captures quite well the weekly observed number of ILI cases . The contact matrices and 349 exposure time matrices provided quite similar results for the total population and most of age groups , except 350 11 .

More precisely , the use of exposure time captured the observed ILI 351 curve for this age group better compared to models informed by all social contact data . In general , the quality 352 of the fit does not differ substantially between age groups . The models tend to overestimate the number of 353 ILI cases for children and teenagers aged 0 – 19 years and adults aged 20 – 64 . 354 Discussion and conclusions 355 We analysed time use and social contact data and compared their use as proxy for effective contacts governing 356 disease transmission for disease transmitted through the respiratory route . Our data set is unique since it 357 provides both time use and social contact data from the same participants , avoiding possible differences due 358 to sample biases . In our analysis we identified the main drivers in shaping everyday time use and linked this 359 info to social contact patterns . 360 361 The reported time use patterns in Belgium are quite similar to the published patterns for Italy [ 37 ] , but dif - 362 ferent from the results from Zimbabwe [ 38 ] . In Zimbabwe , the working - age participants and children less than 363 6 years old reported much less time at work and school , respectively , compared with participants of the same 364 age group in Belgium and Italy . We found that males spent on average ± 2 hours more at work than females , 365 which is in line with previous work [ 39 , 40 ] . We also found that both males and females living with children 366 spend more time at home than people living without children , which is consistent with what was found in [ 39 ] . 367 The expected temporal patterns were observed , with more time spent at “other” locations during weekends 368 and holiday periods . The time spent at home seemed not to be affected by the type of day . Our gender - specific 369 analysis of the time use data indicated that participants were prone to spend more time with the same gender 370 when they are young , and more time with the other gender when they are older . This result differs from the 371 observed gender - specific contact rates as reported in [ 19 ] , where the assortativity is reported to be higher for 372 same - gender contacts . 373 374 Power law dispersal has been useful to model disease counts [ 13 , 14 , 15 ] , though questions remained whether 375 this also holds for social contact behavior , the driver of transmission dynamics [ 2 ] . Danon et al . [ 16 ] showed 376 a relation between clustering and distance from home , with high clustering within two miles , dominated by 377 home contacts , but the highest value of clustering occurring at a distance 50 miles or more from home . The 378 authors hypothesize that this might be due to differences in the purpose behind contacts made at various 379 distances . 380 In our study , we observed an increase in the number of contacts by distance during weekdays until an age - 381 specific distance - threshold . A large - scale study in Taiwan [ 41 ] reported that 52 . 7 % of contacts took place at 382 a distance less than 1 km from home , 29 . 2 % at a distance 1 - 9 km from home , 14 . 6 % at a distance 10 - 49 km 383 from home . In our study , this pattern was clearly age - specific . Half of our reported contacts during regular 384 weekdays for children between [ 0 - 18 ) years of age took place less than 1 km from home . During weekends , we 385 observed more contacts at + 10 km from home . In general , we observed that the average number of contacts 386 decreased by distance , while the individual - level pattern is reverse . As such , social contact patterns condi - 387 tional upon presence at each distance provided useful info to inform spatial transmission models . A study in 388 China quantified the distances from home based on the latitude and longitude of each reported contact and 389 12 .

( which was not certified by peer review ) The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 28 , 2022 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2022 . 01 . 25 . 22269385 doi : medRxiv preprint observed an increase in assortative mixing when contacts were made further from home [ 42 ] . We observed 390 similar patterns with the construction of conditional social contact matrices by distance . A study in the 391 United Kingdom [ 43 ] requested for infants to report the maximum distance travelled from home , but , to date , 392 did not report results thereof . Other survey designs ( e . g . , [ 38 ] ) included the distance between home and work 393 but did not report results related to this information , yet . 394 395 The age - specific social contact and time use patterns followed a similar trend of assortativeness , which stresses 396 once more the tendency for people to interact with people of a similar age . In addition to that , strong mixing 397 among generations ( parent - child ) was present in both the social contact and time use matrices . The inter - 398 generation mixing is mostly observed at home , and was more pronounced in the exposure time matrix than 399 in the contact matrix . With our unified survey , we can confirm the contrasting effect of the relative small 400 number of social contacts at home compared to the large amount of time spent at home , as observed in [ 10 , 38 ] . 401 402 Social contact matrices provide useful data to estimate disease transmission dynamics in terms of the transmis - 403 sion dynamics and relative incidence [ 1 , 2 ] . As such , we estimated the R 0 for each distance conditional upon 404 presence , and observed a clear increase by distance . This reflects an increasing transmission potential by dis - 405 tance from the individual - level perspective . The latter is of interest for meta - population and individual - based 406 models , were individuals join other sub - populations at distance . We found that a constant ( or decreased ) 407 social mixing behavior by distance conditional upon presence is likely to underestimate the transmission po - 408 tential . Some individual - based models handled this by the use of location - specific mixing patterns irrespective 409 of distance from home [ 44 ] . 410 411 We compared the value of different social contact features ( duration , physical / non - physical , etc . ) to inform 412 transmission models for parvovirus - B19 and VZV . By scoring the model - based prevalence with Belgian sero - 413 logical data , we found that physical contacts provided the best proxy for both parvovirus - B19 and VZV . In 414 terms of contact duration , the best model fit was obtained with physical contacts of long duration ( more than 415 4 hours ) for parvovirus - B19 and ( more than 1 hour ) for VZV . Goeyvaerts et al . [ 3 ] reported the best fit to 416 VZV with physical contacts of at least 15 minutes ; this result is also in line with the study of [ 4 ] . However , 417 the previous studies did not analysed all combinations in terms of contact duration and physical / non - physical 418 contacts , which explains the new “best estimate” in our study . 419 420 We also compared the results of the contact approach , the time use approach and the suitable contact approach 421 in fitting serological data of VZV and parvovirus - B19 . In the case of VZV , the suitable contact approach pro - 422 vided the best fit , while for parvovirus - B19 , the time use approach gave the best fit . Our results are consistent 423 with the findings of De Cao et al . [ 11 ] , although we observed much higher parameter estimates for q 2 ( 0 . 13 vs 424 0 . 001 for parvovirus - B19 and 0 . 94 vs 0 . 37 for VZV ) , but the confidence intervals of these parameter estimates 425 were overlapping . 426 427 We also tested the value of contact matrices and exposure time matrices in fitting the dynamic transmission 428 model to weekly ILI incidence data in the season 2010 - 2011 in Belgium . Exposure time matrices provided 429 a better fit to ILI than overall contact matrices and the integration of these two types of matrices did not 430 13 .

Within the social contact approach , physical contacts provided a better proxy for 431 the risks of influenza transmission than non - physical contacts . We found that R 0 of the best model is 1 . 43 , 432 this result is consistent with a systematic review of estimates of R 0 for different types of influenza [ 45 ] and 433 a study in UK [ 35 ] that also used contact matrices to fit to ILI incidence data . However , this value is lower 434 than the estimates in [ 34 ] , in which physical contact matrices from the Belgian POLYMOD data were used 435 to fit to ILI data over multiple influenza season from 2003 to 2009 . The difference in R 0 can be explained by 436 the relatively low number of ILI cases reported in the 2010 - 2011 season we used in this study . In addition , 437 note that small differences in model parametrization entail substantial differences between the estimates of 438 R 0 , which was also mentioned in [ 34 ] . 439 440 In our study , we combined information from time use and social contact data to gather information on human 441 mixing patterns . One of the main advantages with respect to previous work is that both sources of informa - 442 tion came from the same survey . To keep participants’ burden as low as possible , time use information was 443 collected with rather large time slots and participants were asked to fill in only one location for each time 444 slot . However , the comparison with more refined time use surveys performed in Flanders [ 39 , 40 ] confirms 445 that we were able to well characterize time use patterns at an aggregated level . Therefore , we expect that this 446 limitation did not substantially affect our results . 447 448 Our work emphasises the value of the unique and complementary information from time use and social contact 449 data for analysing behavior and informing disease transmission models . Depending on the disease , one of the 450 two data sources may be a better proxy for the transmission route of the pathogen . In particular , combining 451 social contact and time use data can provide an improved measure of risk events with respect to VZV . 452 Furthermore , our analysis based on data from the same survey is in line with studies that merged information 453 from different surveys [ 10 , 11 ] . This indicates that complementing social contact with independent time use 454 data is a viable choice for the analyses presented here . 455 Declarations 456 Ethics approval and consent to participate 457 The contact dataset used for the current study are available online within the social contact data sharing 458 initiative which is part of the ERC consolidator grant “TransMID” which received ethical approval from the 459 Hasselt University Medical Ethical Committee ( CME2016 / 618 ) . 460 The seroprevalence data are anonymous and openly available on the SIMID website ( https : / / www . simid . be / modeling - 461 infectious - disease - parameters - based - on - serological - and - social - contact - data / ) . 462 The Belgian National Reference Centre of Influenza ( BELNIC ) is responsible for the laboratory surveillance 463 of influenza in Belgium .
