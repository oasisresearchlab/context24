Implications for Myo5’s role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis are 19 discussed . 20 3 Abstract 21 Myosins are required for clathrin - mediated endocytosis , but their precise molecular roles 22 in this process are not known . This is , in part , because the biophysical properties of the 23 relevant motors have not been investigated . Myosins have diverse mechanochemical 24 activities , ranging from powerful contractility against mechanical loads to force - sensitive 25 anchoring . To better understand the essential molecular contribution of myosin to 26 endocytosis , we studied the in vitro force - dependent kinetics of the Saccharomyces 27 cerevisiae endocytic type I myosin called Myo5 , a motor whose role in clathrin - mediated 28 endocytosis has been meticulously studied in vivo . We report that Myo5 is a low - duty - ratio 29 motor that is activated ~ 10 - fold by phosphorylation , and that its working stroke and actin - 30 detachment kinetics are relatively force - insensitive . Strikingly , the in vitro 31 mechanochemistry of Myo5 is more like that of cardiac myosin than like that of slow 32 anchoring myosin - 1s found on endosomal membranes . We therefore propose that Myo5 33 generates power to augment actin assembly - based forces during endocytosis in cells . 34 4 Introduction 35 36 During clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , the plasma membrane invaginates and 37 undergoes scission to become a cytoplasmic vesicle . Coat proteins like clathrin can deform 38 membranes under low tension ( Dannhauser and Ungewickell , 2012 ; Busch et al . , 2015 ; Cail 39 et al . , 2022 ) , but when membrane bending is resisted by membrane tension ( Hassinger et 40 al . , 2017 ) , the actin cytoskeleton drives plasma membrane invagination ( Boulant et al . , 41 2011 ; Kaplan et al . , 2022 ) . In yeasts , including Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 42 Schizosaccharomyces pombe , turgor pressure opposes plasma membrane invagination , so 43 actin is required at every CME site ( Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ; Basu et al . , 44 2013 ) . 45 The actin cytoskeleton can produce pushing and pulling force , both of which are 46 required for CME in S . cerevisiae ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) . When actin filament ends grow against a 47 surface , they push the surface forward ( Mogilner and Oster , 1996 , 2003 ) . During CME , actin 48 filaments , bound by coat proteins , grow against the plasma membrane at the base the CME 49 site , driving invagination ( Picco et al . , 2015 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 , 2003 ; Skruzny et al . , 2012 , 50 Fig . 1 ) . Modeling of the homologous CME machinery in mammalian cells has demonstrated 51 that such actin networks generate sufficient power for CME ( Akamatsu et al . , 2020 ) , but 52 whether actin assembly alone can overcome turgor pressure in yeast cells is under debate 53 ( Nickaeen et al . , 2019 ; Carlsson , 2018 ) . 54 Additional power may be provided by myosins , which generate tension on actin 55 filaments . The myosins critical for CME , Myo3 and Myo5 in budding yeast , and Myo1e in 56 vertebrates , are type I myosins ( Geli and Riezman , 1996 ; Cheng et al . , 2012 ; Krendel et al . , 57 5 2007 ) . Some type I myosins are well - suited to generate power – i . e . , they carry out 58 mechanical work per unit time by consuming ATP to execute a power stroke . Other type I 59 myosins are ideally suited to serve as force - sensitive anchors – their ATPase cycle is easily 60 arrested by resistance , locking them in a state that maintains tension without completing the 61 ATPase cycle or powering movement ( Greenberg and Ostap , 2013 ) . The possible roles of 62 type I myosins in CME depend on whether endocytic myosins are power generators or force - 63 sensitive anchors . 64 If endocytic type I myosins are acutely force - sensitive , they might organize the actin 65 filaments of the endocytic actin network , while if they are less force sensitive , they could 66 power plasma membrane invagination ( Evangelista et al . , 2000 , Fig . 1 ) . Myosin - 1 motors 67 form a ring at the base of CME sites , where the invaginated membrane meets the plasma 68 membrane ( Mund et al . , 2018 , Fig . 1 ) . Yeast type I myosins serve at least one organizational 69 function as a membrane anchor for the actin assembly machinery , a function associated 70 with the non - motor tail of the molecules ( Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ) , but motor activity is 71 required in addition to membrane anchorage ( Pedersen and Drubin , 2019 ) . If endocytic 72 myosin - 1s are force sensitive anchors , they may serve a further organizational role by 73 holding growing filaments in an optimal orientation for force generation ( Fig . 1 , left ) . If the 74 myosins are power - generating motors , they may pull actin filament ends away from the 75 plasma membrane , deepening the plasma membrane invagination and creating space for 76 monomer addition and filament elongation ( Fig . 1 , right ) , a model supported by the 77 observation that the actin assembly rate at CME sites depends on type I myosin motors in a 78 dose - dependent manner ( Manenschijn et al . , 2019 ) . 79 6 To distinguish between these possibilities , we measured the force sensitivity of the 80 endocytic myosin Myo5 ( not to be confused with the vertebrate type V myosin ) . Myo5 is 81 insensitive to resistive force compared to related myosins . We therefore propose that Myo5 82 actively powers CME . Because actin and myosin collaborate in a variety of membrane 83 remodeling processes , we expect that these results will be instructive beyond CME . 84 7 Results and Discussion 85 86 Heavy Chain Phosphorylation Activates Myo5 ATPase Activity 87 To determine how force sensitive Myo5 is , we first needed to measure its unloaded 88 kinetics . We purified a Myo5 construct containing the motor and lever domains from S . 89 cerevisiae ( Fig . 2A ) . Because phosphorylation of Myo5 at the TEDS site is required for most 90 CME events and is thought to regulate Myo5’s motor activity ( Grosshans et al . , 2006 ; Sun et 91 al . , 2006 ; Bement and Mooseker , 1995 ) , we purified a phosphorylated version and an 92 unphosphorylated version of the protein separately ( See Materials and methods ) . p21 93 activated kinase was used to phosphorylate the myosin at the TEDS site ( S357 ) , as 94 determined by control experiments with an S357A mutant ( Fig . S1 ) . The phosphorylation 95 state of preparations was judged to be uniform when ATP - induced actoMyo5 dissociation 96 transients were well fit by single exponential functions ( see below ) . The yeast light chain 97 for Myo5 , calmodulin ( Cmd1 , Geli et al . , 1998 ) was purified from E . coli and included in 98 excess in all experiments ( Fig . 2A ) . 99 We measured the steady - state actin - activated ATPase activities of phosphorylated 100 and unphosphorylated Myo5 using the NADH - coupled assay ( De La Cruz and Ostap , 2009 ) 101 in the presence of 0 - 80 µM phalloidin - stabilized actin . Unphosphorylated Myo5 ATPase 102 activity was largely insensitive to actin : the ATPase rate for at 0 µM actin was 0 . 14 s - 1 , while 103 the maximum ATPase rate measured was 0 . 39 s - 1 at 40 µM actin . ( Fig . 2B ) . Phosphorylation 104 activated Myo5 ATPase activity by about 10 - fold ( Fig . 2B ) . The actin concentration 105 dependence of the phosphorylated Myo5 ATPase rate ( k obs ) was well fit by : 106 𝑘 ! " # = 𝑣 ! $ ! " # [ & ’ ( ) * ] , $ % & " ’ ( - [ & ’ ( ) * ] ( Equation 1 ) 107 8 From the fit , the actin concentration at half - maximum of the ATPase rate ( K ATPase ) was 108 determined to be 5 . 1 ± 0 . 88 µM , and the maximum ATPase rate ( V max ) was found to be 3 . 3 ± 109 0 . 15 s - 1 ( Fig , 2B ; Table 1 ) . 110 111 ATP Binding and ADP Release are Non - Rate Limiting for Myo5 ATPase Activity 112 Resistive force impacts the rate of myosin detachment from actin , and two biochemical 113 transitions , ADP release and subsequent ATP binding , determine the detachment rate . 114 Therefore , we used stopped - flow kinetics to measure ADP release from ( Fig . 2C , k + 5 ’ ) and 115 ATP binding to ( Fig . 2C , K 1 ’ and k + 2 ’ ) actoMyo5 . 116 We found that yeast Myo5 does not quench the fluorescence of actin labeled at cys - 374 117 with pyrene iodoacetamide , which is the probe most used to measure actomyosin 118 attachment and detachment ( De La Cruz and Ostap , 2009 ) . Thus , we measured actoMyo5 119 detachment by monitoring light scattering , which decreases as myosin unbinds actin . 120 To determine the rate constant for ATP binding , we mixed nucleotide - free actoMyo5 121 ( 100 nM ) with varying concentrations of ATP and monitored 90 ° light scattering in the 122 stopped - flow instrument . Light scattering time courses followed single exponential 123 functions ( Fig 2D ) . For phosphorylated Myo5 , the observed rates determined from the fits 124 increased linearly with ATP concentration ( Fig . 2E ) . At concentrations of > 1 mM ATP , the 125 actomyosin complex dissociated within the response time of the instrument , precluding 126 measurement . For unphosphorylated Myo5 , the observed rates fit a rectangular hyperbola 127 with increasing ATP concentration ( Fig . 2E ) . 128 9 The mechanism was modeled as ( De La Cruz and Ostap , 2009 ) : 129 𝐾 . / 𝑘 0 ′ 𝑘 1 ) # # 130 𝐴𝑀 + 𝐴𝑇𝑃 ⇌ 𝐴𝑀 ( 𝐴𝑇𝑃 ) ⟶ 𝐴𝑀 . 𝐴𝑇𝑃 ⟶ 𝐴 + 𝑀 . 𝐴𝑇𝑃 , ( Scheme 1 ) 131 where K 1 ’ is a rapid equilibrium binding step , k 2 ’ is a rate - limiting isomerization to the 132 AM . ATP state , and k diss is the rapid actin dissociation step . The apparent second order rate 133 constant for ATP binding to phosphorylated actoMyo5 was determined by a linear fit to the 134 data ( K 1’ k 2’ = 0 . 39 ± 0 . 017 µm - 1 s - 1 ) . The unphosphorylated actoMyo5 data were fit by : 135 𝑘 ! " # = 1 , ) * [ & 34 ] . - , ) * [ & 34 ] 2 𝑘 0 ′ , ( Equation 2 ) 136 and the maximum rate of isomerization ( k 2 ’ = 290 ± 24 s - 1 ) and ATP affinity ( K 1’ = 0 . 006 ± 137 0 . 0016 µM - 1 ) were determined . The apparent second - order rate constant for ATP binding 138 ( K 1 ’ k 2 ’ ) was determined from a linear fit of the observed rates below 100 µM ATP to be 1 . 1 139 ± 0 . 28 µM - 1 s - 1 ( Table 1 ) . 140 The rate constant for ADP dissociation ( k + 5 ’ ) was measured by preincubating 141 100 µM ADP with 200 nM actoMyo5 and then rapidly mixing with 2 . 5 mM ATP as shown in 142 scheme 2 : 143 𝑘 5 / 144 𝐴 . 𝑀 . 𝐴𝐷𝑃 ⇌ 𝐴 . 𝑀 + 𝐴𝑇𝑃 ⇌ 𝐴 . 𝑀 ( 𝐴𝑇𝑃 ) ⟶ 𝐴 + 𝑀 . 𝐴𝑇𝑃 , ( Scheme 2 ) 145 When myosin active sites are saturated with ADP , the rate of ATP - induced dissociation of 146 actomyosin is limited by ADP’s slow dissociation . Light scattering transients were fitted by 147 single exponential functions , yielding rates for ADP release for phosphorylated actoMyo5 148 ( k + 5 ’ = 74 ± 2 . 0s - 1 ) and for unphosphorylated actoMyo5 ( k + 5 ’ = 107 ± 5 . 9 s - 1 ) ( Fig . 2F and 149 Table 1 ) . The signal - to - noise ratio of the fast light scattering transients is low , resulting in 150 large uncertainties on these fits . However , these rates are substantially faster than the 151 10 steady - state ATPase values , but slower than the maximum rate of ATP - induced actomyosin 152 dissociation . ADP release for actoMyo5 ADP is much faster than ADP release for vertebrate 153 Myo1b and Myo1c ( Greenberg et al . , 2012 ; Lewis et al . , 2006 ) . It is more similar to the 154 vertebrate endocytic myosin - 1 , Myo1e ( El Mezgueldi et al . , 2002 ) . Because ADP release is 155 rate limiting for detachment of Myo5 and Myo1e from actin , fast ADP release by these 156 molecules mean that the unloaded actin - attachment lifetimes for endocytic type I myosins 157 are < 15 ms . This property may make these motors particularly well - suited to function in 158 dynamic actin networks like those at CME sites , where actin filaments elongate and 159 “treadmill” into the cytoplasm ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . 160 161 Actin gliding is dependent on Myo5 phosphorylation state 162 Our kinetic results suggest that both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Myo5 have 163 low duty ratios ( i . e . , the motor spends a small fraction of its ATPase cycle bound to actin ) . 164 Since ADP release limits the rate of phosphorylated Myo5 detachment from actin at 165 saturating ATP ( k + 5 ’ = 74 ± 2 . 0 s - 1 ) and since we have measured the overall ATPase rate 166 ( V max = 3 . 3 ± 0 . 15 s – 1 ) , we can estimate the duty ratio : 167 𝐷𝑢𝑡𝑦 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 = ( ) + * , ) ( ) - . / 0 ) , ( Equation 3 ) 168 The calculated duty ratio of phosphorylated Myo5 is 0 . 045 . Unphosphorylated Myo5 has a 169 lower duty ratio ( < 0 . 004 ) . 170 To assess the effect of phosphorylation on Myo5 motility , we performed in vitro 171 motility assays at 1 mM ATP . Motors were attached site - specifically to coverslips coated 172 with anti - His 6 antibody . Coverslips were incubated with a range of concentrations of 173 11 phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Myo5 , creating a titration series of surface 174 densities . At low Myo5 surface densities ( incubation with ≤ 30 nM phosphorylated Myo5 , 175 ≤ 150 nM unphosphorylated Myo5 ) , actin filaments failed to bind the coverslip ( Fig . 2G and 176 movies S1 and S2 ) . At higher concentrations , phosphorylated Myo5 moved actin filaments 177 at velocities ranging from 720 ± 40 nm / s ( 100 nM phosphorylated Myo5 ) to 880 ± 90 nm / s 178 ( 40 nM ) ( Fig . 2G and movie S1 ) . These gliding velocities are considerably higher than those 179 reported by Sun et al . , 2006 , possibly reflecting differences in the phosphorylation state of 180 the purified Myo5 protein ( see below ) or differences in other motility assay conditions , 181 such as light chain availability . Higher ( > 5 - fold ) surface densities of unphosphorylated 182 Myo5 were required to achieve smooth motility , but this motility occurred at a 183 substantially slower speed , ~ 120 nm / s ( Fig . 2G and movie S2 ) . While it is possible that 184 residual phosphorylated Myo5 in the unphosphorylated prep contributed to this motility , 185 Sun et al . , 2006 similarly reported that Myo5 harboring TEDS site mutations moved actin 186 filaments much more slowly . The slower actin gliding speed for unphosphorylated myosin 187 was unexpected given the similar rates of ADP release between phosphorylated and 188 unphosphorylated Myo5 ( Table 1 ) . It is possible that the our kinetics experiments have not 189 determined the rate limiting step for detachment , but it is more likely that motility of the 190 unphosphorylated myosin is limited by the slow attachment rate of the motor ( Stewart et 191 al . , 2021 ) , as suggested by the slow actin - activated ATPase rate . The activation of Myo5 192 motility by phosphorylation could explain why fast , cargo - induced endocytosis , which 193 involves rapid and dynamic actin turnover , requires phosphorylated Myo5 , while slower 194 constitutive endocytosis does not ( Grosshans et al . , 2006 ) . 195 196 12 Myo5’s working stroke comprises two substeps that are consistent with unloaded 197 kinetic measurements 198 The kinetics of actin attachment durations and mechanics of single myosin molecules were 199 measured using an optical trapping instrument that can detect sub - nanometer 200 displacements with millisecond temporal resolution ( Woody et al . , 2018 ; Snoberger et al . , 201 2021 ) . We used the three - bead optical trapping geometry in which a biotinylated actin 202 filament is held between two laser - trapped polystyrene beads coated with neutravidin , 203 creating a bead - actin - bead dumbbell ( Fig . 3A ) . Dumbbells were lowered onto pedestal 204 beads that were sparsely coated with phosphorylated Myo5 - His 9 bound to a surface - 205 adsorbed anti - His 6 tag antibody . The positions of trapped beads were detected via 206 quadrant photodiode detectors , and single actomyosin binding events were detected by the 207 decrease in covariance of the positions of the two dumbbell beads ( Fig . 3B - D ) . 208 Traces acquired at 1 , 10 , and 1000 µM ATP reveal displacements and drops in 209 covariance during actomyosin binding events . Individual points from covariance traces 210 were fit by double gaussian distributions , with the thresholds for event detection indicated 211 as dotted gray lines in Fig . 3 B - D . Event durations decreased with increasing ATP 212 concentrations ( Fig . 3 B - D , blue lines ) . 213 The myosin - 1 working stroke has been shown to occur in two discrete substeps , 214 with the first substep occurring with actin - activated phosphate release , and the second 215 occurring with ADP release ( Jontes et al . , 1995 ; Veigel et al . , 1999 , Fig . 3E ) . The substeps 216 can be characterized in optical trapping assays by ensemble averaging single interactions 217 ( Veigel et al . , 1999 ; Chen et al . , 2012 ; Laakso et al . , 2008 ) , where the detected events are 218 13 aligned at their beginnings and forward - averaged in time ( Fig 3F - H , left ) , or aligned at their 219 ends and reverse - averaged in time ( Fig 3F - H , right ) . 220 Ensemble averages of Myo5 interactions showed a two - step working stroke at the 221 three ATP concentrations , but the step - size was most accurately resolved at 10 µM ATP 222 ( see Materials and methods ) . In this condition , an initial substep of 4 . 8 nm was followed by 223 a second substep of 0 . 2 nm ( Fig . 3G ) . We determined the lifetimes of the substeps by fitting 224 the ensemble averages with single exponential functions . At 1 µM ATP ( Fig . 3F , left trace ) , 225 the measured rate ( > 30 s - 1 ) of the time - forward average was limited by the covariance 226 smoothing window , but at 10 and 1000 µM ATP ( Fig . 3 G - H , left traces ) , the rates were 49 ± 227 1 . 6 and 50 ± 0 . 2 s - 1 , respectively ( Fig . 3K ) which are similar to the measured ADP release 228 rate ( k + 5 ’ , 74 ± 2 . 0 s - 1 , Table 1 ) supporting the model that the transition from state - 1 to 229 state - 2 accompanies ADP release . 230 The kinetics of time - reversed averages reveal the lifetime of State 2 ( Fig . 3F - H , right 231 traces ) . Fitting single exponential functions to these traces reveals rates of 0 . 59 ± 0 . 003 and 232 7 . 34 ± 0 . 1 s - 1 at 1 and 10 µM ATP , respectively ( Fig . 3K ) . At 1000 µM ATP , the observed rate 233 ( > 187 s - 1 ) was limited by the size of the covariance smoothing window ( 5 . 25 ms ; Fig . 3K ) . 234 The observed rates at 1 and 10 µM ATP are consistent with the second order rate constant 235 for ATP binding of 0 . 39 ± 0 . 017 µM - 1 s - 1 measured by stopped - flow kinetics ( K 1 ’ k + 2 ’ , 236 Table 1 ) . 237 We determined the detachment rates of actomyosin events by plotting the 238 cumulative frequency of individual attachment durations and fitting a single exponential 239 function to the data by maximum likelihood estimation ( Fig . 3I ) . Data from 1 and 10 μM 240 ATP were well fit by single exponentials with rates of 0 . 88 and 6 . 87 s - 1 , respectively ( Fig . 3I , 241 14 Fig . 3K ) . These rates match well with the observed rate of ATP binding ( Table 1 ) , as well as 242 the fits for the reverse ensemble averages , indicating that at sub - saturating ATP ( 1 and 10 243 µM ) , detachment is limited by ATP binding ( Figure 3J , blue squares & gray diamonds , Fig . 244 3K ) . Data from 1000 μM ATP were best described as the sum of 2 exponentials , with the 245 major rate of 67 . 8 s - 1 comprising 92 . 1 % of the total , and a minor rate of 11 . 6 s - 1 comprising 246 7 . 9 % of the total ( Fig . 3I , Fig . 3K ) . The major rate is consistent with both the observed ADP 247 release rate and the measured forward ensemble average rates , indicating that at 248 saturating ATP , ADP release limits detachment of actomyosin interactions ( Fig . 3J , blue 249 square and black diamond , Fig . 3K ) . 250 251 Myo5 is a relatively force - insensitive motor 252 To elucidate the force sensitivity of Myo5 , we measured how its actin detachment rate was 253 affected by mechanical force opposing the power stroke using an isometric feedback 254 system that maintained the actin filament near its initial position ( Takagi et al . , 2006 ) . The 255 initial force applied to Myo5 in this system depends in part on where along the actin 256 filament Myo5 stochastically binds , so this approach allowed measurement of attachment 257 durations at a range of resistive forces ( Fig . 4A ) . Plotting attachment durations as a 258 function of force revealed a general trend of longer attachment durations at higher 259 resisting forces . At each interaction force , attachment durations are exponentially 260 distributed and , as expected based on prior isometric feedback experiments , the data 261 appear noisy when plotted this way ( Fig . 4A ) . Converting these data to detachment rates by 262 binning them by force at every ten points , averaging , and taking the inverse of the 263 attachment duration more clearly reveals the trend ( Fig . 4B ) . 264 15 The force dependence of the Myo5 detachment rate was fit by the Bell Equation : 265 𝑘 ( 𝐹 ) = 𝑘 8 ∙ 𝑒 12∙4 + 5∙6 ( Equation 4 ) 266 where k ( F ) is the detachment rate at force F , k 0 is the detachment rate in the absence of 267 load , d is the distance parameter ( the distance to the force - dependent transition state and a 268 measure of force sensitivity ) , k B is Boltzmann’s constant , and T is the temperature . Best fit 269 parameters for k 0 and d were determined by maximum likelihood estimation of the 270 unaveraged data from Fig . 4A , incorporating the instrument response time ( 15 - 30 ms , 271 Woody et al . , 2016 ) . The estimated detachment rate in the absence of force is 67 . 6 s - 1 , in 272 close agreement with the measured detachment rate under low load conditions at 1000 µM 273 ( saturating ) ATP ( 67 . 8 s - 1 , Fig . 3K ) . The best fit value for the distance parameter , d , was 274 1 . 14 nm . 275 To put Myo5’s force sensitivity in context , we re - plotted the function describing the 276 force - dependent actin detachment rate of Myo5 alongside the same curves for vertebrate 277 Myo1b , Myo1c , and b - cardiac myosin , which have previously been determined by the same 278 experimental approach ( Fig . 4C , Laakso et al . , 2010 ; Greenberg et al . , 2012 ; Woody et al . , 279 2018 ) . The mechanochemistry of Myo5 ( d = 1 . 14 nm ) is most like that of b - cardiac ( muscle ) 280 myosin ( d = 1 . 3 nm ) , suggesting that it is well - suited for generating power . The difference 281 between Myo5 and acutely force - sensitive Myo1b , a tension - sensitive anchor myosin ( d = 282 15 nm ) , is dramatic . From 0 to 2 pN of resistance , Myo1b attachment lifetimes slow from 283 ~ 600 ms to ~ 45 s , resulting in negligible power generation ( Fig . 4D ) . Over the same 284 interval , Myo5 attachment lifetimes slow very modestly from ~ 15 ms to ~ 25 ms , allowing 285 16 it to generate considerable power ( Fig . 4D ) . Thus , Myo5 is unlikely to act as a force - 286 sensitive anchor in cells and is more likely to power movements against a resisting load . 287 288 Proposed function of type I myosin in clathrin - mediated endocytosis 289 Myo5 is one of the best - studied myosin - 1 proteins in vivo . Quantitative live cell imaging 290 and electron microscopy have revealed that it is recruited to CME sites simultaneously with 291 initiation of actin assembly , where it concentrates at the base of the site as membrane 292 invagination proceeds ( Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ; Idrissi et al . , 2008 ) . Although it has long 293 been appreciated that the presence ( Geli and Riezman , 1996 ; Goodson et al . , 1996 ) and 294 mechanochemical activity ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) of type - 1 myosins are required for CME , the 295 mechanistic contribution of motor activity to the dynamic actin network was unknown . 296 When it was discovered that some type I myosins are acutely force sensitive ( Laakso et al . , 297 2008 ) , it became apparent that these motors could have mechanochemical activities that 298 range from force - dependent anchoring to power generation during CME . However , 299 distinguishing among these possibilities has been difficult in cells . Mutant Myo5 molecules 300 lacking the motor head or bearing mutations intended to lock the ATPase in low and high 301 actin affinity states each block CME , results that do not reveal the mechanochemical role of 302 Myo5 ( Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ; Idrissi et al . , 2012 ) . Perhaps the most informative finding in 303 cells has been the observation that varying the number of type I myosins at CME sites 304 results in differences in actin assembly rates ( Manenschijn et al . , 2019 ) . However , because 305 resistive load remodels growing branched actin networks in complex ways ( Bieling et al . , 306 2016 ) , even this finding did not clearly differentiate between the possible roles for 307 endocytic myosin - 1s . 308 17 Here we have shown that Myo5’s motor generates power rather than forming force - 309 sensitive catch bonds . The overall ATPase rate of Myo5 is slow relative to other power - 310 generating myosins , but its power stroke and detachment from actin are fast , and they slow 311 only modestly under load ( Fig . 4C ) . Myo5’s relative force insensitivity means it generates 312 steady power against resistance ( Fig . 4D ) . Because Myo3 and Myo5 can each support CME 313 in the absence of the other , we suspect that Myo3 is similarly force - insensitive . Given the 314 structural and functional homology between Myo5 and vertebrate Myo1e , together with 315 the close agreement of their unloaded kinetics ( El Mezgueldi et al . , 2002 ) , we also predict 316 the Myo1e generates biologically relevant power . 317 Our finding that Myo5’s kinetics are relatively force insensitive lead us to interpret 318 the previously described dose dependence of actin assembly on the number of myosin - 1s 319 at endocytic sites to mean that this motor moves actin filaments at CME sites to power 320 plasma membrane invagination and create space for new monomers to assemble 321 ( Manenschijn et al . , 2019 , Fig . 1 , right ) . On the order of 300 myosin molecules ( Myo3 and 322 Myo5 combined ) are present at CME sites , mostly where the invaginating membrane meets 323 the plasma membrane ( Mund et al . , 2018 ; Idrissi et al . , 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2019 ; Picco et al . , 324 2015 ) . A related myosin , Myo1c , also binds membranes and can generate and sustain sub - 325 piconewton forces parallel to the plane of the membrane , and greater forces when moving 326 actin filaments away from the membrane or when diffusion within the bilayer is impeded 327 ( Pyrpassopoulos et al . , 2016 ) . Myo5’s diffusion is likely to be impeded by the many proteins 328 at the base of CME sites , and it may move actin filaments at an angle to the membrane it is 329 bound to . Actin subunits “treadmill” towards the cytoplasm in endocytic actin networks at 330 ~ 50 - 100 nm / s ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 , 2003 ) , so Myo5’s motility rate of 700 - 900 nm / s ( Fig . 331 18 2G ) , which we would expect resistance to slow only modestly , is fast enough to do work on 332 the actin network as it assembles . We therefore expect that the myosins power membrane 333 invagination and relive load to accelerate actin assembly during CME . 334 Type I myosins are involved in a variety of membrane reshaping events in cells , 335 where they often interact with growing branched actin networks ( Sokac et al . , 2006 ; 336 Almeida et al . , 2011 ; Joensuu et al . , 2014 ; Krendel et al . , 2007 ; Cheng et al . , 2012 ) , but the 337 relative contributions of myosin motor activity and actin assembly have rarely been 338 resolved . Here , we demonstrated that a type I myosin critical for CME , a process well - 339 known to be driven by actin assembly , generates power . Implication of endocytic type I 340 myosin as a force - insensitive motor suggests that actin assembly and myosin power 341 generation can be coordinated to do coherent work in membrane remodeling processes . 342 19 Materials and methods 343 344 Reagents , proteins , and buffers 345 ATP concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically after each experiment by 346 absorbance at 259 nm , 𝜖 259 = 15 , 400 M - 1 cm - 1 . For all ATP solutions , one molar equivalent of 347 MgCl 2 was included to make MgATP . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared and gel 348 filtered ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) . Actin concentrations were determined 349 spectrophotometrically by absorbance at 290 nm , 𝜖 290 = 26 , 600 M - 1 cm - 1 . All actin was 350 stabilized with one molar equivalent of phalloidin ( Sigma ) . Steady - state , transient , and 351 single molecule experiments were performed at 20°C in KMg25 buffer ( 60 mM MOPS pH 7 , 352 25 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT ) . Apyrase VII was obtained from Sigma . 353 Purity and concentration of purified proteins were determined by comparing in - gel 354 Coomassie blue staining to staining of known amounts of bovine serum albumin ( Pierce ) . 355 356 Expression and Purification of Cmd1 357 The S . cerevisiae calmodulin gene CMD1 was cloned from genomic DNA into a bacterial 358 expression plasmid with a sequence encoding His 6 - TEV situated at the 5’ end to generate 359 pDD2743 . pDD2743 was transformed into Rosetta E . coli , optimized for expression 360 ( Novagen ) . A saturated overnight culture in LB ( 10 g / L Bacto tryptone , 5 g / L Bacto yeast 361 extract , 10 g / L NaCl ) was used to inoculate a 1 L culture in LB to OD 600 = 0 . 1 . Cells were 362 grown to OD 600 = 0 . 6 - 1 , induced with 0 . 5 mM IPTG for 5 hours at 37°C , pelleted at 4 , 225 x g 363 for 20 minutes at 4°C in a Sorvall SLA - 3000 ( fixed angle ) rotor , washed with cold 20 mM 364 HEPES pH 7 . 5 , and repelleted at 2 , 250 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C in a Jouan CR3i ( swinging 365 20 bucket ) centrifuge . Cell pellets were flash frozen in 45 mL lysis buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 366 7 . 5 , 1 M KCl , 20 mM Imidazole ) . Upon thawing , cells were lysed by sonication , 2 mg DNase I 367 ( Roche ) and triton X - 100 to 1 % were added , and the resulting lysate was incubated on ice 368 for 30 minutes , then spun at 92 , 000 x g for 25 minutes in a Beckman Type 70 Ti rotor . The 369 supernatant was loaded onto a 1 mL HisTrap HP column ( GE healthcare ) preequilibrated 370 with binding buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM KCl , 20 mM imidazole ) . The column 371 was washed with 20 mL binding buffer , and Cmd1 was eluted using a 30 mL linear gradient 372 from 0 - 100 % elution buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM KCl , 500 mM imidazole ) . 373 Fractions containing Cmd1 were pooled , Cmd1 was cleaved from His 6 with TEV protease 374 and dialyzed overnight at 4°C into low salt buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH 7 , 25 mM NaCl , 2 mM 375 MgCl 2 , 5 mM DTT ) . Following dialysis , purified , cleaved Cmd1 was bound to a MonoQ 376 column and eluted using a 10 mL linear gradient from 0 - 70 % high salt buffer ( 10 mM Tris 377 pH 7 , 1 M NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM DTT ) . Fractions containing Cmd1 were pooled , dialyzed 378 into KMg50 buffer ( 60 mM MOPS pH 7 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 379 5 % glycerol ) , and stored at - 80°C . 380 381 Expression and Purification of Myo5 382 Myo5 was coexpressed with the myosin chaperone She4 in S . cerevisiae . The MYO5 open 383 reading frame ( ORF ) from S . cerevisiae was cloned from genomic DNA and truncated at 384 Gly 763 , generating a construct containing the motor domain and both Cmd1 - binding IQ 385 motifs of the lever arm . The SHE4 ORF was cloned in its entirety from S . cerevisiae genomic 386 DNA . Both ORFs were ligated into a 2µ expression plasmid with a partially defective LEU2 387 gene ( leu2d ) to ensure high copy number , creating plasmid pDD2744 ( parent vector 388 21 described in Roy et al . , 2011 ) . The MYO5 ORF was situated with a sequence encoding 389 AviTag - TEV - His 9 at the 3’ end . Expression of the MYO5 and SHE4 ORFs was driven by a 390 bidirectional Gal 1 / 10 promotor . 391 pDD2744 was transformed into D1074 yeast ( Roy et al . , 2011 ) . Saturated overnight 392 cultures in synthetic minimal medium ( 1 . 5 g / L Difacto yeast nitrogen base , 5 g / L 393 ammonium sulfate , supplemented with 2 % glucose 20 µg / mL adenine , L - histadine , L - 394 methionine , and 30 µg / mL L - lysine ) were used to inoculate 1 . 5 L cultures in the same 395 media with raffinose substituted for glucose to OD 600 = 0 . 1 . After 18 hours of growth at 396 30°C , cultures were induced with 2 % galactose , Bacto yeast extract was added to 10 g / L , 397 and Bacto peptone to 20 g / L . After 8 hours of expression , the cells were harvested at 4 , 225 398 x g for 20 minutes at 4°C in a Sorvall SLA - 3000 rotor , washed with 25 mL cold Milli - Q 399 water , repelleted at 2 , 250 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C in a Jouan CR3i centrifuge , resuspended 400 in 0 . 2 volumes of cold Milli - Q water , and drop frozen into liquid nitrogen . Lysis was 401 achieved through cryomilling ( 10 cycles of 3 minutes grinding with one minute cooldown ) 402 in the large vials of a 6870 freezer / mill ( SPEX Sample Prep ) . 403 Cell powders were thawed in binding buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH 7 , 500 mM NaCl , 4 mM 404 MgCl 2 , 2 mM ATP , 20 mM imidazole , 5 mM DTT ) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF , 1 x 405 cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail without EDTA ( Roche ) , and 1 µM Cmd1 . For 406 purification of phosphorylated Myo5 , 1 µg Pak1 ( Sigma , Brzeska et al . , 1997 , Fig . S1 ) was 407 included in the lysis buffer and 10 mM β - glycerophosphate , 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 408 and 50 mM sodium fluoride were included in all purification buffers . For purification of 409 unphosphorylated Myo5 , 4000 units lambda phosphatase ( NEB ) and 1 mM MnCl 2 were 410 included in the lysis buffer . The lysate was then spun at 345 , 000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C 411 22 in a Beckman TLA100 . 3 rotor , filtered through a 0 . 22 µm filter , and loaded onto a 1 mL 412 HisTrap HP column . The column was washed with wash buffer ( Binding buffer with only 413 200 mM NaCl ) , and Myo5 was eluted using a 20 mL linear gradient from 0 - 100 % elution 414 buffer ( wash buffer with 1 M imidazole ) . 415 Fractions containing Myo5 were pooled and supplemented with Cmd1 to 1 µM . For 416 unphosphorylated Myo5 purification , a further 20 , 000 units lambda phosphatase were 417 added along with MnCl 2 to 1 mM and the fractions were incubated at 30°C for 30 minutes . 418 Purified protein was dialyzed through a 3 . 5 KDa MWCO membrane into 1 L storage buffer 419 ( KMg50 with 50 % glycerol ) overnight at 4°C and again into 500 mL of the same buffer for 2 420 hours at 4°C , then stored at - 20°C . 421 422 Kinetic measurements 423 Steady - state actin - activated ATPase activity was measured using the NADH enzyme - linked 424 assay in an Applied Photophysics ( Surrey , UK ) SX . 18 MV stopped - flow apparatus ( De La 425 Cruz and Ostap , 2009 ) . One reaction syringe contained the ATP mix ( 200 µM NADH , 20 426 U / mL lactic dehydrogenase , 100 U / mL pyruvate kinase , 500 µM phopho ( enol ) pyruvate , 2 427 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM ATP in KMg25 ) and the other syringe contained the mixture of actin ( 0 - 80 428 µM ) and myosin ( 100 nM ) in KMg25 . Concentrations above are post - mixing . After mixing , 429 the concentration of NADH loss due to ATP hydrolysis was monitored by absorbance at 340 430 nm ( 𝜖 340 = 6 , 220 M - 1 cm - 1 ) , and the linear regions of the curve were fitted to a straight line 431 to determine ATPase activity . 432 ATP - induced dissociation of actoMyo5 was measured and analyzed as described ( De 433 La Cruz and Ostap , 2009 ) . Briefly , one reaction syringe contained ATP ( 0 – 2 . 7 mM ) in 434 23 KMg25 and the other syringe contained 100nM Myo5 and 100 nM phalloidin - stabilized 435 actin . Reactants were rapidly mixed by the instrument , and light scattering at 90˚ was 436 acquired using a 450 nm excitation light and a 400 nm emission filter . Experimental 437 transients were fit by single exponentials using the software provided with the stopped - 438 flow apparatus . 1 - 7 traces were averaged together to generate each data point . 0 . 04 439 units / mL apyrase was added to solutions of actoMyo5 before mixing to remove 440 contaminating ADP and ATP . Unphosphorylated actoMyo5 required prolonged treatment 441 with apyrase to achieve sufficient signal , presumably because a larger fraction of the 442 population was bound to ATP left over from purification and because the actin - activated 443 ATPase rate of unphosphorylated Myo5 is slow . ADP release transients were acquired and 444 analyzed as above by preincubating 100 µM ADP with 200 nM actoMyo5 and then rapidly 445 mixing with 2 . 5 mM ATP . Concentrations reported are post - mixing . 446 447 Motility assays 448 Motility assays were carried out essentially as in ( Lin et al . , 2005 ) . Double - sided Scotch 449 tape and vacuum grease were used to create flow chambers from a clean glass coverslip 450 ( 22 mm x 40 mm , # 1 . 5 , Fisher ) and a glass coverslip coated with 20 µL nitrocellulose 451 ( Ernest F . Fullam , Inc . , catalog number 11180 ) . A mouse monoclonal antibody against His 6 452 ( Sigma ) , made 0 . 2 mg / mL in motility buffer ( 10 mM MOPS pH 7 , 25 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 453 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT ) , was first added to the flow chamber , and incubated there for 5 454 minutes to coat the nitrocellulose - coated coverslip with the antibody . The flow chamber 455 was then blocked for 2 minutes with 2 mg / mL casein . Blocking coverslips with bovine 456 serum albumin ( BSA ) led to inferior gliding . Phosphorylated or unphosphorylated Myo5 in 457 24 motility buffer with 2 mg / mL casein , diluted to a range of concentrations as indicated in 458 Fig . 2G , was added to the flow chamber and incubated for 2 minutes , then the chamber was 459 washed once with motility buffer containing 1 mM ATP and 5 µM Cmd1 and three more 460 times with the same buffer without ATP . Motility was initiated by loading the chambers 461 with 5 nM rhodamine phalloidin - labeled actin filaments in motility buffer with 1 µM ATP , 5 462 µM Cmd1 , 2 mg / mL casein , 0 . 4 mg / mL glucose oxidase , 0 . 08 mg / mL catalase , 5 mg / mL 463 glucose . Movies of actin motility in the flow chambers were recorded at room temperature 464 ( ~ 20˚C ) on a Leica DMI3000 B microscope outfitted with a 100x , 1 . 4 NA plan apo objective 465 and a Retiga R6 CCD camera ( Teledyne ) , controlled by Metamorph software . The rate of 466 actin filament gliding was determined using the manual tracking plugin in Fiji . 467 468 Optical trapping 469 Flow chambers for optical trapping were constructed with double - sided tape and vacuum 470 grease as previously described ( Snoberger et al . , 2021 ; Greenberg et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , the 471 coverslip was coated with a 0 . 1 % mixture of nitrocellulose and 2 . 47 μm diameter silica 472 beads . Coverslips were dried at least 30 minutes and were used within 24 hours of 473 preparation . To define the walls of the flow cell , 2 strips of double - sided tape were placed 474 ~ 5 mm apart , a 1 mm thick glass slide was placed on top , and carefully sealed with vacuum 475 grease after addition of final buffer . 476 Trapping buffer ( KMg25 with 1 mM DTT freshly added ) was used for all trapping 477 assays . A 100x stock of glucose oxidase + catalase ( GOC ) was freshly prepared by 478 centrifuging catalase ( Sigma , > 30000 U·mL - 1 ) at 15 , 000 x g for 1 minute , and adding 2 μl of 479 catalase supernatant to 20 μL of 19 . 1 U / μL glucose oxidase ( Sigma ) . 480 25 0 . 01 mg / mL anti - His 6 antibody ( Sigma ) was flowed in the chamber and incubated 481 between 30 seconds and 3 minutes , then immediately blocked with two , 3 - minute 482 incubations of 1 - 2 mg / mL BSA . Stocks of phosphorylated His 9 - tagged Myo5 were diluted 483 to 1 nM in trapping buffer with 300 mM added KCl and incubated in the flow cell for 2 484 minutes . The number of myosins bound to the surface was limited by the surface 485 concentration of anti - His 6 antibody , and the incubation time of anti - His 6 antibody was 486 adjusted daily between 30 seconds and 3 minutes such that 1 of 3 - 5 pedestals tested 487 showed clear myosin interactions with the actin dumbbell . 488 Following incubation with Myo5 , a second blocking step with two , 3 - minute 489 incubations of 1 - 2 mg / mL BSA was performed . Final buffer added to the flow cell 490 contained trapping buffer with indicated amount of ATP , 1 μL of GOC added immediately 491 prior to addition to chamber , and 0 . 1 - 0 . 25 nM rabbit skeletal muscle actin polymerized 492 with 15 % biotinylated actin ( Cytoskeleton ) stabilized by rhodamine - phalloidin ( Sigma ) at a 493 1 . 1 - 1 . 2 molar ratio with G - actin concentration . Neutravidin - coated beads were prepared by 494 incubating 0 . 4 ng of 0 . 8 μm diameter polystyrene beads ( Polysciences ) and coated with 5 495 mg / mL neutravidin ( Thermo Fisher ) . 3 μL of neutravidin - coated beads were added to one 496 side of the chamber prior to sealing . All trapping data were acquired within 90 minutes of 497 addition of the final buffer to the chamber . 498 Optical trapping experiments were performed at room temperature ( 20 ± 1 °C ) 499 using a dual beam 1064 nm trapping laser as described in ( Woody et al . , 2018 , 2017 ) . A 500 single laser beam was split into 2 beams using polarizing beam splitters and steered into a 501 60x water immersion objective ( Nikon ) . Laser light was projected through an oil 502 immersion condenser and into quadrant photodiodes ( JQ - 50P , Electro Optical Components , 503 26 Inc . ) , each of which were conjugate to the back focal plane of the objective . Direct force 504 detection from the quadrant photodiodes was achieved using a custom - built high - voltage 505 reverse bias and an amplifier . Data acquisition , beam position control output , and isometric 506 feedback calculations were controlled with custom - built virtual instruments ( Labview , 507 Matlab ) . 508 Individual 0 . 8 μm diameter neutravidin - coated bead were caught in the two traps 509 and held approximately 5 μm apart . Trap stiffnesses were adjusted to 0 . 05 – 0 . 1 pN / nm for 510 each trap . A biotinylated actin filament visualized by rhodamine phalloidin was bound to 511 the two trapped beads , creating a bead - actin - bead dumbbell . The dumbbell was 512 pretensioned ( 3 - 5 pN ) by steering one beam using a piezo controlled mirror conjugate to 513 the back focal plane of the objective , and the surface of pedestal beads were probed for 514 myosins . Putative myosin interactions were detected via drops in variance of the two 515 beads , and the 3 - dimensional position of the dumbbell relative to the myosin was refined 516 further by maximizing the rate and size of the observed power stroke deflections . Every 30 - 517 60 s , the dumbbell was moved axially along the actin filament in ~ 6 nm steps between 518 trace acquisition to ensure even accessibility of actin - attachment target zones . Stage drift 519 was corrected via a feedback system using a nano - positioning stage and imaging the 520 position of the pedestal bead with nm precision ( Woody et al . , 2017 ) . In experiments using 521 1 μM ATP , due to the longer actomyosin interactions , stage drift was still observed even 522 with the stage feedback engaged , leading to a presumed underestimation of the 523 displacement size . All data were acquired at a sampling rate of 250 kHz . 524 Isometric optical clamping experiments were performed as described in ( Woody et 525 al . , 2018 ; Takagi et al . , 2006 ) using a digital feedback loop and a 1 - D electro - optical 526 27 deflector ( EOD , LTA4 - Crystal , Conoptics ) to steer the beam position using input from a high 527 voltage source ( Conoptics , Model 420 Amplifier ) . Briefly , the position of one bead ( the 528 “transducer” bead ) was maintained at a constant position by adjusting the position of the 529 other bead ( referred to as the “motor” bead ) during actomyosin interactions . The response 530 time of the feedback loop during actomyosin interactions was ~ 15 - 30 ms . 531 532 Optical trap data analysis 533 Actomyosin interactions for non - isometric optical clamping experiments were detected 534 using the single - molecule computational tool SPASM ( Software for Precise Analysis of 535 Single Molecules , Blackwell et al . , 2021 ) , which uses a calculation of the dumbbell bead 536 covariances and a change - point algorithm . Data collected at 1000 μM ATP were analyzed at 537 250 kHz , while data collected at 1 and 10 μM ATP were downsampled to 2 kHz by 538 averaging every 125 points to enhance analysis speed . Events were detected by calculating 539 the covariance of the 2 beads using a smoothing window of 33 . 3 , 15 , and 5 . 25 ms and an 540 averaging window 60 , 36 , and 12 ms at 1 , 10 , and 1000 μM ATP , respectively . The 541 instrument deadtime was calculated to be 2 times the covariance averaging window . For 542 each 15 s trace , the detected covariance was plotted and fit to double gaussian 543 distributions , with the smaller mean gaussian corresponding to the actomyosin “bound” 544 portion and the larger mean gaussian corresponding to the “unbound” portion of events . A 545 putative event was defined as an event where the covariance starts above the unbound 546 peak mean , drops below the bound peak mean , and remains below the unbound peak mean 547 for at least the length of the instrument deadtime prior to returning back above unbound 548 peak mean . Event starts and ends were further refined using a changepoint algorithm as 549 28 described ( Blackwell et al . , 2021 ) . Attachment durations and ensemble averages of single 550 events were determined using built - in features in the SPASM software . Exponential fits for 551 forward and reverse ensemble averages were performed in Origin 2019 graphing & 552 analysis software ( OriginLab ) . 553 Events detected in isometric optical clamping experiments were detected as 554 described in ( Takagi et al . , 2006 ) using a zero crossing analysis via custom MATLAB scripts . 555 Briefly , when a myosin is actively engaged with the dumbbell , force is applied to the 556 transducer bead , a feedback loop is engaged and opposing force applied to the motor bead 557 until the position of the transducer bead is restored . Beginnings of events are defined at the 558 point at which the feedback signal increases from baseline in the motor bead , and ends of 559 events are defined when the feedback signal decreases back below the baseline in the 560 motor bead . 561 562 Online supplemental material 563 Figure S1 shows the results of a kinase assay demonstrating that Pak1 , used to in 564 purifications of phosphorylated Myo5 , specifically phosphorylates Myo5 serine - 357 . 565 29 Acknowledgements 566 567 We thank M .

The Coomassie - stained gel 856 was imaged on a standard photo scanner and the phosphor screen on a Typhoon gel imager 857 ( Amersham ) . Note that there are differences in baseline labeling in the absence of added 858 kinase between the two different protein preps , but addition of Pak1 clearly results in 859 radiolabeling of wild type but not mutant Myo5 . 860 861 Movie S1 : Motility assays with phosphorylated Myo5 862 Rhodamine phalloidin - labeled actin filaments gliding over coverslips coated with a 863 concentration series of phosphorylated Myo5 protein in motility buffer with 1 mM ATP . 864 Movies were collected at 1 frame per second and are played back at 16 frames per second . 865 866 867 Movie S2 : Motility assays with unphosphorylated Myo5 868 Rhodamine phalloidin - labeled actin filaments gliding over coverslips coated with a 869 concentration series of unphosphorylated Myo5 protein in motility buffer with 1 mM ATP . 870 43 Short movies of motility at 100 nM and 150 nM unphosphorylated Myo5 were collected 871 because no motility was observed . Movies at all other concentrations were collected at 1 872 frame every 4 seconds and are played back at 16 frames per second . The playback rate of 873 Movie S2 is four times faster than the playback rate of Movie S1 . 874 Arp2 / 3 F - actin Coat protein G - actin Power generation by Myo5 Anchoring of actin by Myo5 Figure 1 Type I Myosin Table 1 : Rate and equilibrium constants of the Myo5 ATPase cycle V max ( s - 1 ) K ATPase ( µM ) ATP binding K 1 ' ( µM - 1 ) k + 2 ' ( s - 1 ) K 1 ' k + 2 ' ( µM - 1 s - 1 ) a ADP release k + 5 ' ( s - 1 ) 3 . 3 ( ± 0 . 15 ) ND 5 . 1 ( ± 0 . 88 ) ND ND 0 . 006 ( ± 0 . 0016 ) ≥ 335 290 ( ± 24 ) 0 . 39 ( ± 0 . 017 ) b 1 . 1 ( ± 0 . 28 ) c 74 ( ± 2 . 0 ) 107 ( ± 5 . 9 ) Phosphorylated Myo5 Unphosphorylated Myo5 Steady - state actin - activated ATPase a Determined from a linear fit of the unbinding rates . b Linear fit of all data for Phosphorylated Myo5 in Fig . 2E . c Linear fit of observed rates below 100 µM ATP for Unphosphorylated Myo5 in Fig 2E .
