VAV1 is found predominantly in hematopoietic cells , whereas VAV2 and VAV3 are more broadly expressed . VAV proteins link the cell surface receptors like FCGR to the intracel - lular Rho GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton during phagocytosis ( Hall et al 2006 ) . Experiments using two - hybrid system suggest that VAV1 with its SH2 domain directly binds to the phosphorylated Y342 of SYK ( Deckert et al . 1996 ) . VAV proteins are also recruited to membrane through their PH domain by binding PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 produced by PI3K .

This folding is mediated through binding of tyrosines in the acidic domain to the DH domain and through binding of the CH domain to the C1 region . Activation of VAV may involve at least three dif - ferent events to relieve this auto - inhibition . Phosphorylation of the tyrosines in the acidic domain causes them to be displaced from the DH domain , binding of a ligand to the CH domain may cause it to release the C1 domain and binding of PIP3 to PH domain may alter its conformation . VAV1 is phosphorylated on Y174 in the acidic domain , and this is mediated by Syk and Src - family tyrosine kinases . Once activated , VAV1 is then involved in the activation of RAC and CDC42 downstream of FCGR . Followed by : Activation of RAC1 by VAV Literature references Xu , X . , Chong , AS . ( 1996 ) .

Specifically , RAC1 and CDC42 are known to be stimulated upon engage - ment of FCGR and are essential for the extension of the pseudopods that surround and engulf the phago - cytic particle ( Scott et al 2005 ) . RAC1 is known to regulate actin dynamics . It is active throughout the pha - gocytic cup and activated RAC1 is necessary to assemble F actin . However , closing the phagocytic cup requires RAC1 to be deactivated ( Naakaya et al 2007 ) . Deletion of RAC1 prevents FCGR mediated phago - cytosis ( Hall et al 2006 ) . RAC1 activation involves transition from an inactive GDP bound to an active GTP bound state catalysed by guanine exchanges factors ( GEFs ) . VAV has been implicated in the activation of RAC1 ( Patel et al 2002 ) .

DOCK180 , a member of GEFs , is found to be involved in the activation of RAC1 . DOCK180 associates with the adaptor protein CRKII and the complex is found to accumulate at the phagocytic cup . DOCK180 is recruited to the sites of phagocytosis by binding to SH3 domain of CRKII through its proline - rich motif ( Hasegawa et al 1996 ) . CRKII is likely recruited to the activated FCGR complex by binding phosphorylated ITAM tyrosines on the receptor or through other phosphotyrosines on ancillary proteins that are recruited to the recept - or complex ( Lee et al 2007 ) . Unlike the usual GEFs , DOCK180 does not contain the conserved Dbl homo - logy ( DH ) domain . Instead , it has a DHR - 2 or DOCKER domain capable of loading RAC with GTP ( Brug - nera et al 2002 ) . Binding of DOCK180 to RAC alone is insufficient for GTP loading , and a DOCK180 - ELMO interaction is required . ELMO1 , as well as ELMO2 , form a complex with DOCK180 and they function to - gether as a bipartite GEF to optimally activate RAC ( Gumienny et al 2001 , Brugnera et al 2002 ) .

The resulting actin polymerization mediates the projection of the plasma membrane in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles . WAVEs exist as a pentameric hetero - complex called WAVE Regulatory Complex ( WRC ) . The WRC consists of a WAVE family protein ( WASF1 , WASF2 or WASF3 - commonly known as WAVE1 , WAVE2 or WAVE3 ) , ABI ( Abelson - interacting protein ) , NCKAP1 ( NAP1 , p125NAP1 ) , CYFIP1 ( SRA1 ) or the closely related CYFIP2 ( PIR121 ) , and BRK1 ( HSPC300 , BRICK ) . Of the three structurally conserved WAVEs in mammals , the importance of WAVE2 in activation of the ARP2 / 3 complex and the consequent formation of branched actin filaments is best established . WAVEs in the WRC are intrinsically inactive and are stimulated by RAC1 GTPase and phosphatidylinosit - ols ( PIP3 ) . The C - terminal VCA domain of WAVE2 ( and likely WAVE1 and WAVE3 ) which can bind both the ARP2 / 3 complex and actin monomers ( G - actin ) is masked in the inactive state . After PIP3 binds to the polybasic region of WAVE2 ( and likely WAVE1 and WAVE3 ) and RAC1 : GTP binds to the CYFIP1 ( or CY - FIP2 ) subunit of the WRC , allosteric changes most likely occur which allow WAVEs to interact with the ARP2 / 3 complex . The interactions between WAVEs and RAC1 are indirect . BAIAP2 / IRSp53 , an insulin re - ceptor substrate , acts as a linker , binding both activated RAC1 and the proline - rich region of WAVE2 ( and likely WAVE1 and WAVE3 ) and forming a trimolecular complex . CYFIP1 ( or CYFIP2 ) in the WAVE regu - latory complex binds directly to RAC1 : GTP and links it to WAVE2 ( and likely WAVE1 and WAVE3 ) ( D - erivery et al . 2009 , Yamazaki et al . 2006 , Takenawa & Suetsugu 2007 , Chen et al . 2010 , Pollard 2007 , Lebensohn & Kirschner 2009 ) .

WAVE proteins can be phosphorylated by various kinases . Active ERK ( Mitogen activated protein kinase 3 ) phosphorylates the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) on multiple serine / threonine sites within the proline - rich domains ( PRDs ) of WAVE2 and ABI1 . Phosphorylation of the PRDs would disrupt their interaction with SH3 and PLP binding domains , potentially altering WRC activation . ERK phosphorylates both S343 and T346 in WAVE2 and S183 , S216 , S225 , S392 , and S410 in ABI1 . Cumulatively , the phosphorylation of both WAVE2 and ABI in the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) contributes to the RAC - induced WRC conformational change that exposes the VCA domain , lead - ing to binding and activation of ARP2 / 3 ( Mendoza et al . 2011 , Nakanishi et al . 2007 ) .

CDC42 activation is restricted at the advancing edge of the phagocytic cup , where actin is concentrated , and is deactivated at the base of the phagocytic cup ( Beemiller et al 2010 ) . The mechanism behind the recruitment and activation of CDC42 during FCGR pha - gocytosis is unknown . VAV regulates the activation of RAC1 but not CDC42 and the GEF responsible for CDC42 activation during FCGR - mediated phagocytosis remains unidentified ( Adam et al 2004 , Patel et al 2002 ) .

WASP and N - WASP possess a central GTPase binding domain ( GBD ) and an NH2 - terminal WASP homology domain 1 ( WH1 ) followed by a basic region ( B ) , and a C - terminal VCA region that con - tains : a V domain ( verprolin homology / WASP homology 2 ) , a C domain ( connecting ) , and an A motif ( acidic ) . The VCA region is responsible for binding to and activating the ARP2 / 3 complex ( Bompard & Caron 2004 , Callebaut et al 1998 ) . Under resting conditions , WASP and N - WASP are maintained in an autoinhibited state via interaction of the GBD and the VCA domains . This prevents access of the ARP2 / 3 complex and G - actin to the VCA region . Activated CDC42 binds to the GBD region of WASPs and this in - teraction releases the VCA region from autoinhibition , enabling binding of the ARP2 / 3 complex and stim - ulating actin polymerization ( Kim et al 2000 , Park & Cox 2009 ) .

The VCA module acts as a platform on which an actin monomer binds to the ARP2 / 3 complex to trigger actin polymerization ( Takenawa & Suetsugu 2007 ) .

These branched actin filaments push the cell membrane forward to form a pseudopod . The ARP2 / 3 complex is composed of two Arps ( actin - related proteins ) , ARP2 and ARP3 , and five unique pro - teins ARPC1 , ARPC2 , ARPC3 , ARPC4 and ARPC5 ( Gournier et al . 2001 ) . Both ARP2 and ARP3 subunits bind ATP . There are two proposed models to explain the process of actin nucleation by ARP2 / 3 complex : the barbed - end branching model and the dendritic nucleation / side branching model ( Le Clainche & Carlier 2008 ) . In barbed - end branching model , the branching / ternary complex ( G - actin - WASP / WAVE - Arp2 / 3 complex ) binds to the barbed end of the mother filament . G - actin bound to VCA domain or one of the Arp subunits incorporates into the mother filament at the barbed end , thus positioning ARP2 / 3 complex to initiate the daughter branch on the side of the mother filament . ARP2 / 3 nucleates the formation of new actin fila - ment branches , which elongate at the barbed ends ( Le Clainche & Carlier 2008 , Pantaloni et al 2000 , Le Clainche et al . 2003 , Egile et al . 2005 ) . In side branching model , the branching complex binds to the side of the mother actin filament mimicking an actin nucleus and initiates a lateral branch ( Le Clainche & Carlier 2008 , Amann & Pollard 2001 ) .

The kinase inhibitory ( KI ) domain of one PAK1 molecule binds to the C - terminal catalytic domain of the other and inhibits catalytic activity .

CFL1 is a member of the ADF ( actin - depolymerizing factor ) pro - tein family that is involved in regulating actin dynamics in the growth cone . It binds to actin in a one - to - one molar ratio , and stimulates both the severing of actin filaments and depolymerization of actin sub - units from the actin filament end . Activated LIMK phosphorylates CFL1 on the conserved serine 3 residue located near the actin - binding site . After phosphorylation , CFL1 is inactive , loses its affinity for actin and dissociates from G - actin monomers . Once freed , ADP - actin monomers can exchange ADP with cytoplasmic ATP , ready for reincorporation at the barbed end of a growing filament ( Gungabissoon & Bamburg 2003 ) .

It is recruited to the forming phagosome by bind - ing , through its second PH domain to membrane PIP3 , a major product of PI3 - kinase ( Cox et al . 2002 ) . Myosin - X may act as a motor to transport membrane cargo molecules to the forming pseudopods , influ - encing actin dynamics . It is not understood with certainty how myosin X contributes to the mechanism of pseudopod extension . It selectively binds to actin bundle such that each head may bind , in an ATP - sensitive manner , to two adjacent actin filaments within the actin bundle . Myosin X hydrolyze ATP and converts this chemical energy to mechanical energy moving toward the plus end / barbed end of the actin filament facing towards the tip of the growing pseudopods ( Araki 2006 , Chavrier 2003 , Watanabe et al 2010 ) .

Myosin motor proteins are the actin - binding proteins , with ATPase activity move along actin fibers , and produce the driving force for phagosome formation and transport . Several myosin motors including myosins IC , II , V , IXb are in - volved in FCGR - mediated phagocytosis as force generators and actin - based transport motors ( Swanson et al . 1999 ) . Nonmuscle myosin II , is a motor protein known to generate intracellular contractile forces and tension by associating with F - actin . It has been observed to localize around forming phagosomes and suggested a role in phagocytic - cup squeezing during FCGR - mediated phagocytosis . Each myosin II motor protein exists as a complex consisting of two copies each of myosin II heavy chain ( MHC ) , essential light chains ( ELC ) , and myosin regulatory light chain ( MRLC ) . Selective inhibition of myosin II by ML - 7 , a my - osin light - chain kinase ( MLCK ) inhibitor , prevents phagocytic cup closure , but not pseudopod extension for the formation of phagocytic cups in FCGR - mediated phagocytosis ( Grooves et al . 2008 , Araki 2006 ) . Tight ring of actin filaments within the elongating pseudopodia squeezes the deformable particles . In the classical zipper model for phagocytosis , the pseudopod extends over the IgG - coated particles , in which FCGRs in the phagocyte plasma membrane interact sequentially with Fc portions of IgG molecules zip - pering the membrane along the particle . This sequential IgG - FCGR binding might not occur by itself , but requires forced zipper closure , where myosin - II contractile activity may promote the binding between the FCGR and its ligands , to facilitate the efficient extension and subsequent closure of phagocytic cups ( Araki 2006 , ) . Myosin IC mediates the purse - string - like contraction that closes phagosomes . Myosin - V has been implicated in membrane trafficking events ( Swanson et al . 1999 ) .
