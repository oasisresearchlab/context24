S156814 nDrg3 facilitates colorectal cancer metastasis through activating src phosphorylation Ting li ruochuan sun Mingdian lu Jiacong chang Xiangling Meng * huo Wu * Department of general surgery , The First affiliated hospital of anhui Medical University , he Fei , 230222 , china * These authors contributed equally to this work Background : NDRG3 is an N - myc downregulated gene ( NDRG ) . The aim of this article was to identify the role of NDRG3 in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) and to determine the mechanism underlying its function . Methods : Using immunohistochemical staining , expression and clinicopathological variables of NDRG3 were analyzed in 170 CRC samples . Overexpression of NDRG3 was employed in SW1116 cells , downregulation of NDRG3 was achieved in RKO cells , then migration and invasion assays were performed in vitro , and a mouse model was constructed in vivo . Results : Increased expression of NDRG3 was observed in primary CRC tissues , and this expression was correlated with distant metastasis . Consistently , ectopic expression of NDRG3 in SW1116 cells enhanced cell migration and invasion , while knockdown of NDRG3 in RKO cells significantly suppressed CRC cell metastasis . The portal vein injection models suggested that NDRG3 overexpression facilitates liver metastasis . These events were associated with the phosphorylation of Src ( c - Src ) at Tyr 419 site . Conclusion : Our results showed that NDRG3 facilitates CRC migration and invasion by activating Src phosphorylation , suggesting the role of NDRG3 as a candidate oncogene . Keywords : NDRG3 , colorectal cancer , metastasis , Src Introduction Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , being the third most common cancer and the fourth most common cause of oncological death worldwide , is a disease of high morbidity and mortality . 1 In recent years , with the prevalence of westernized lifestyle , high CRC rates have been reported in the developing countries in which the risk was once low . 2 Despite noticeable improvements in early diagnosis and development of novel therapy , CRC causes a large number of deaths ascribed to metastatic events . 3 Therefore , it is of urgent need to elucidate the molecular mechanism that is involved in the progression of CRC for early detection and target treatment . Recently , the N - myc downregulated gene ( NDRG ) family has been discovered , which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation . 4 The NDRG family is composed of four members : NDRG1 , NDRG2 , NDRG3 , and NDRG4 , and they share a 57 % – 65 % amino acid identity to one another . 4 , 5 Phylogenetic analysis showed that NDRG1 and NDRG3 belong to one subfamily , whereas NDRG2 and NDRG4 belong to another . 5 NDRG1 was first discovered and can be activated by various conditions including androgens and hypoxia . 5 – 9 NDRG1 has been widely found to enhance differentiation , reduce proliferation rate , and suppress cancer metastasis of various types of cancer cells , indicating the important role of NDRG1 in tumor suppressing . 10 – 12 Interestingly , NDRG1 can upregulate transcrip - tion factor p53 and is necessary for p53 - mediated apoptosis . 13 NDRG2 is upregulated in Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) brains and is associated with AD pathogenesis . 14 NDRG2 can correspondence : huo Wu ; Xiangling Meng Department of general surgery , The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University , number 218 , JiXi road , he Fei , china email drwuhuo @ 163 . com ; xianglingmeng55 @ sina . com Journal name : OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation : Original Research Year : 2018 Volume : 11 Running head verso : Li et al Running head recto : Role of NDRG3 in colorectal cancer DOI : 156814 O n c o T a r ge t s and T he r ap y do w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / www . do v ep r e ss . c o m / b y 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 on 21 - A p r - 2019 F o r pe r s ona l u s e on l y .

NDRG3 is a critical gene that leads to homologous lethality in the early embryo development and regulates the male meiosis in mouse . 16 NDRG3 can be detected in multiple human tissues , with high expression in testis , prostate , and ovary and low expression in placenta , lung , liver , skeletal muscle , and so on . This expression pattern is very similar to that of NDRG1 . 16 , 17 To date , however , little is known about the exact role of NDRG3 involved in tumorigenesis . The aim of this study was to explore the expression of NDRG3 in CRC and investigate its role in cell pro - liferation , migration , and invasion both in vitro and in vivo . Materials and methods Tissue specimens and cell lines Colorectal tumor and adjacent non - tumor tissues of 170 CRC patients were obtained from Ruijin Hospital , School of Medi - cine , Shanghai Jiaotong University . All patients had under - gone radical surgery at Ruijin Hospital from January 2009 to January 2012 . The mean age of the patients was 65 . 6 years ( range : 30 – 79 years ) . None of them had received neoadjuvant therapy such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy prior to surgery . Clinicopathological data were collected and staged according to the UICC TNM classification . This study was approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai Ruijin Hospital , and written informed consent was obtained from all the patients . The human CRC cell lines SW1116 , CaCo 2 , HT - 29 , LoVo , HCT116 , SW480 , SW620 , and RKO were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA , USA ) and preserved in the Shanghai Digestive Surgery Institute .

Ninety - two ( 54 . 1 % ) of the CRC tissues showed NDRG3 - positive staining , whereas 78 of the cancer tissues showed a negative NDRG3 signal ( Figure 1B ) . Furthermore , a correlation analysis between NDRG3 expression and the clinicopathological features revealed that the expression of NDRG3 in the CRC tissues was significantly related to invasion depth ( p = 0 . 013 ) and TNM stage ( p = 0 . 015 ) but not to other factors ( Table 1 ) . construction of stable crc cell lines We explored the NDRG3 expression in a series of CRC cell lines and found that RKO exhibited relatively higher levels of NDRG3 expression and SW1116 exhibited low levels of NDRG3 expression ( Figure 2A ) . In order to explore the functions of NDRG3 in CRC cell lines , we generated a SW1116 cell line ectopically overexpressing NDRG3 and applied lentivirus - mediated shRNA to knockdown NDRG3 in RKO . The effect of overexpression and knockdown was determined by Western blotting ( Figure 2B ) . nDrg3 promotes crc tumor proliferation To investigate the effect of NDRG3 expression on CRC growth , we examined the in vitro cell growth rates by CCK - 8 and colony formation assays . Overexpression of NDRG3 increased the proliferation rate of the SW1116 cells , while depletion of NDRG3 reduced the proliferation rate of the RKO cells ( Figure 3A – C ) . Consistently , there was a greater increase in both tumor volume and tumor weight in animals injected with SW1116 / NDRG3 cells than in those injected with SW1116 / Vector cells ( Figure 4A – C ) . IHC analysis revealed that SW1116 / NDRG3 tumors displayed a higher Ki67 index when compared with SW1116 / Vector tumors ( Figure 4D ) . nDrg3 enhances wound healing , migration , and invasion of crc cells Wound healing assay was used to evaluate the influence of NDRG3 on cellular migration . After 48 hours of incubation , the distance between wound edges of SW1116 / NDRG3 cells was markedly shorter than those of SW1116 / Vector cells . In contrast , a longer distance was noticed in NDRG3 knockdown cells RKO compared with the negative control cells . The wound areas of the experimental group and controls were significantly different ( Figure 5A – C ) .

The amount of cells that migrated into the lower chamber was significantly increased in SW1116 / NDRG3 group compared with the vector control ( Figure 6A and C ) . In contrast , the RKO / KD group was moderately decreased compared with mock group ( Figure 6B and D ) . Similar data were obtained in invasion assays with SW1116 and RKO cells ( Figure 6A – D ) . Thus , together , these results implicate NDRG3 in the regula - tion of characteristic cellular behaviors found in CRC . nDrg3 facilitates tumor metastasis in vivo To determine the function of NDRG3 in liver metastasis , we applied the portal vein injection model . As shown in Figure 7 , there were significantly more visible liver metasta - sis nodules in mice injected with the SW1116 / NDRG3 cells compared with SW1116 / Vector control . These data sug - gested that NDRG3 expression facilitates tumor metastases in vivo . In accordance with these observations , we found that phosphorylation ( Tyr 419 ) of Src was dramatically activated in NDRG3 - overexpressing CRC cells compared (cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:23)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:13)(cid:13) (cid:38) (cid:82) (cid:79) (cid:82)(cid:81) (cid:92) (cid:3) (cid:81)(cid:88) (cid:80) (cid:69) (cid:72) (cid:85) (cid:53)(cid:46)(cid:50)(cid:18)(cid:86)(cid:75) (cid:53)(cid:46)(cid:50)(cid:18)(cid:49)(cid:38) (cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:24)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:23)(cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:13)(cid:13) (cid:38) (cid:82) (cid:79) (cid:82)(cid:81) (cid:92) (cid:3) (cid:81)(cid:88) (cid:80) (cid:69) (cid:72) (cid:85) (cid:54)(cid:58)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:49)(cid:39)(cid:53)(cid:42)(cid:22) (cid:54)(cid:58)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:57)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85) (cid:53)(cid:46)(cid:50)(cid:18)(cid:49)(cid:38) (cid:53)(cid:46)(cid:50)(cid:18)(cid:86)(cid:75) (cid:54)(cid:58)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:57)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85) (cid:54)(cid:58)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:49)(cid:39)(cid:53)(cid:42)(cid:22) (cid:19) (cid:19)(cid:17)(cid:19) (cid:19)(cid:17)(cid:24) (cid:20)(cid:17)(cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:17)(cid:24) (cid:20) (cid:21) (cid:13)(cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:55)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:92)(cid:86)(cid:12) (cid:36) (cid:69) (cid:86) (cid:82) (cid:85) (cid:69) (cid:68) (cid:81) (cid:70)(cid:72) (cid:3) (cid:11) (cid:50) (cid:39) (cid:3) (cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:19) (cid:3) (cid:81) (cid:80) (cid:12) (cid:22) (cid:23) (cid:53)(cid:46)(cid:50)(cid:18)(cid:86)(cid:75) (cid:53)(cid:46)(cid:50)(cid:18)(cid:49)(cid:38) (cid:19) (cid:19)(cid:17)(cid:19) (cid:19)(cid:17)(cid:24) (cid:20)(cid:17)(cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:17)(cid:24) (cid:20) (cid:21) (cid:13)(cid:13) (cid:13)(cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:55)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:92)(cid:86)(cid:12) (cid:36) (cid:69) (cid:86) (cid:82) (cid:85) (cid:69) (cid:68) (cid:81) (cid:70)(cid:72) (cid:3) (cid:11) (cid:50) (cid:39) (cid:3) (cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:19) (cid:3) (cid:81) (cid:80) (cid:12) (cid:22) (cid:23) (cid:54)(cid:58)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:57)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85) (cid:54)(cid:58)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:49)(cid:39)(cid:53)(cid:42)(cid:22) (cid:36) (cid:37) (cid:38) Figure 3 nDrg3 promotes cell proliferation and colony formation .

Discussion As an essential oncoprotein family member , myc partici - pates in the transcriptional program driving , including cell proliferation 20 , 21 and inhibiting cell differentiation . 22 Myc regulates cell proliferation and differentiation mainly through transcriptional regulation of its target genes . 23 Human N - myc down - regulated gene ( NDRG ) family members have been found intimately involved in cell proliferation and differ - entiation . The role of NDRG1 in suppressing metastatic progression has been reported in a series of studies . 24 – 26 Liu et al found that NDRG1 attenuates the downstream signaling of c - Src which involves in the p130Cas - CrkIIRac1 pathway , and this leads to suppression of cellular migration . 27 Mi et al 28 showed that NDRG reduces cav1 expression by promoting its ubiquitylation and degradation via the proteasome in CRC cells . In addition , cav1 mediates the suppressive function of NDRG1 in epithelial – mesenchymal transition , migration , and invasion . 28 NDRG3 has been classified in the same subfamily as NDRG1 and found to be expressed in multiple human tissues .

NDRG3 is upregulated when Raji cells are treated with Silurus asotus lectin ( SAL ) , suggesting that NDRG3 was regulated by signal transduction through the binding of SAL to globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3 ) . 31 These previous studies have led to the current investigation . In the present study , we showed that NDRG3 expression is substantially downregu - lated in CRC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues . This expression is significantly associated with invasion depth , indicating poor prognosis . These data suggest that NDRG3 may be associated with CRC tumorigenicity and metastasis . We performed CCK - 8 and colony formation assays to further determine the importance of NDRG3 in cell proliferation . The results presented in the present study showed that ectopic expression of NDRG3 in the SW1116 cells inhibited cell proliferation and impaired the capability of wound healing , migration , and invasion , while knockdown (cid:53)(cid:46)(cid:50)(cid:18)(cid:49)(cid:38) (cid:53)(cid:46)(cid:50)(cid:18)(cid:86)(cid:75) (cid:19) (cid:3) (cid:75) (cid:21)(cid:23) (cid:3) (cid:75) (cid:23) (cid:27) (cid:3) (cid:75) (cid:54)(cid:58)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:57)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85) (cid:19) (cid:3) (cid:75) (cid:21)(cid:23) (cid:3) (cid:75) (cid:23) (cid:27) (cid:3) (cid:75) (cid:54)(cid:58)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:49)(cid:39)(cid:53)(cid:42)(cid:22) (cid:19) (cid:53) (cid:72) (cid:79) (cid:68) (cid:87) (cid:76) (cid:89)(cid:72) (cid:3) (cid:90) (cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:71) (cid:3) (cid:71) (cid:76) (cid:86) (cid:87) (cid:68) (cid:81) (cid:70)(cid:72) (cid:19) (cid:24) (cid:20)(cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:24) (cid:21)(cid:19) (cid:21)(cid:24) (cid:23)(cid:27) (cid:21)(cid:23) (cid:13)(cid:13) (cid:13)(cid:13) (cid:19) (cid:53) (cid:72) (cid:79) (cid:68) (cid:87) (cid:76) (cid:89)(cid:72) (cid:3) (cid:90) (cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:71) (cid:3) (cid:71) (cid:76) (cid:86) (cid:87) (cid:68) (cid:81) (cid:70)(cid:72) (cid:19) (cid:20)(cid:19) (cid:21)(cid:19) (cid:22)(cid:19) (cid:23)(cid:27) (cid:21)(cid:23) (cid:54)(cid:58)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:57)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85) (cid:54)(cid:58)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:49)(cid:39)(cid:53)(cid:42)(cid:22) (cid:13)(cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:53)(cid:46)(cid:50)(cid:18)(cid:49)(cid:38) (cid:53)(cid:46)(cid:50)(cid:18)(cid:86)(cid:75) (cid:38) (cid:39) (cid:37) (cid:36) (cid:55)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:75)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:12) (cid:55)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:75)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:12) Figure 5 nDrg3 promotes wound healing of crc cells .

Src is a non - receptor tyrosine kinase whose expression and activity are involved in the regulation of oncogenic processes including proliferation , angiogenesis , differentiation , and survival motility . 32 , 33 Upon dephospho - rylation of Src at Tyr530 site , the molecular interactions are destabilized , thus resulting in the autophosphorylation Figure 7 ( Continued ) SW1116 / Vector A SW1116 / NDRG3 O n c o T a r ge t s and T he r ap y do w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / www . do v ep r e ss . c o m / b y 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 on 21 - A p r - 2019 F o r pe r s ona l u s e on l y .

This event allows the opening of SH2 and SH3 domains to interact with G - protein - coupled receptors , recep - tor tyrosine kinases , and focal adhesion kinase . 34 – 36 Evidence showed that Src orchestrates tumor progression through phosphorylating tyrosine residues mainly acting as the downstream of RTKs and integrins . 37 The results presented in the present study show that ectopic NDRG3 in SW1116 cells increased the phosphorylation of Src , while silencing of NDRG3 in RKO cells produced the opposite result . NDRG3 enhances CRC metastasis through the activation of c - Src at Tyr419 . However , how NDRG3 regulates Src remains unknown and is worth a next approach . Conclusion Our data show that NDRG3 promotes CRC cell proliferation , migration , and invasion , suggesting that NDRG3 may be an oncogene in CRC .
