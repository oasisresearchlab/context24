Bryant 1 , 2 Apical - basal polarization is essential for epithelial tissue formation , segregating cortical domains to perform distinct physiological functions . Cortical lipid asymmetry has emerged as a determinant of cell polarization . We report a network of phosphatidylinositol phosphate ( PIP ) - modifying enzymes , some of which are transcriptionally induced upon embedding epithelial cells in extracellular matrix , and that are essential for apical - basal polarization . Unexpectedly , we ﬁ nd that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 localization and function is distinct from the basolateral determinant PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 localizes to the apical surface , and Rab11a - positive apical recycling endosomes . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is produced by the 5 - phosphatase SHIP1 and Class - II PI3 - Kinases to recruit the endocytic regulatory protein SNX9 to basolateral domains that are being remodeled into apical surfaces . Perturbing PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 levels results in defective polar - ization through subcortical retention of apically destined vesicles at apical membrane initiation sites . We conclude that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is a determinant of apical membrane identity .

The simplest epithelium is a monolayer of cells lining a biolo - gical cavity , such as a lumen . To generate such tissue , epithelial cells must form distinct cortical domains 1 . In a proto - typical epithelium , the apical surface faces the lumen , the lateral surface interacts with neighboring cells , whereas the basal surface interacts with the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . The basal and lateral domains are contiguous and termed basolateral . The mechanisms controlling protein delivery to , and maintenance at , cortical domains in polarized cells have been extensively studied 2 . How epithelial cells become polarized and form a lumen de novo remains poorly understood , yet it is an outstanding problem in both development and disease . MDCK cells grown inside ECM to form three - dimensional ( 3D ) cysts have been widely used as a model system of polar - ization and lumen formation . In 3D , these undergo stereotyped morphogenesis , transitioning from a single cell to an apical - basal polarized monolayer radially organized around a central lumen 3 . During this process , each cell generates apical - basal polarization de novo . A number of polarization mechanisms ﬁ rst demon - strated in MDCK cysts are conserved in vivo 4 – 10 . Thus , MDCK cystogenesis is a powerful reductionist system to study epithelial polarization . Upon 3D plating , single - MDCK cells divide into doublets with inverted polarity ; some apical proteins , such as Podocalyxin / gp135 ( Podxl ) , are found at the ECM - abutting surface but excluded from cell – cell contacts 11 , 12 . Integrin - dependent ECM sensing triggers Podxl endocytosis and transcytosis to the apical membrane initiation site ( AMIS ) , a zone at doublet cell – cell contacts which remodels into the nascent lumen 13 . Remodeling involves conver - sion of a basolateral domain into an apical protein delivery zone . This stage is titled the pre - apical patch ( PAP ) 14 . The luminal space expands as the lumen matures . Delivery to the AMIS is regulated by the Rab11a GTPase . Rab11a in ﬂ uences molecular motors and vesicle docking and fusion machinery recruitment to ensure apical protein delivery to the AMIS 12 , 13 , 15 – 17 . Therefore , Rab11a - regulated exocytosis to the AMIS is crucial to generate apical polarity 1 . Phosphatidylinositol phosphate ( PIP ) asymmetry is essential for cell polarization 18 . PIPs can be modi ﬁ ed by reversible phos - phorylation of the 3 - , 4 - , or 5 - position of their inositol ring 19 . Asymmetric PIP production at the cortex , or in organelles , determines membrane identity by scaffolding distinct PIP - binding proteins at these locales . In MDCK cysts apical - basal polarization depends on cortical PIP asymmetry regulated by the 3 - phosphatase PTEN 11 : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is apically enriched , whereas PIP 3 is basolateral . This lead to a model proposing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 as an apical identity determinant ; this model is problematic , given that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is the precursor to PIP 3 and is also basolateral 11 , 18 . Whether alternate PIP species may ful ﬁ ll an apical - speci ﬁ c function is unknown . These advances focus attention on the key question of how existing cell surfaces are remodeled . Speci ﬁ cally , what controls cell – cell contact remodeling into an AMIS ? We elucidate a molecular mechanism of de novo polarization through cortical PIP conversion to promote apical identity . Results PIP distribution during de novo apical - basal polarization . De novo apical - basal polarization in MDCK cysts occurs via ste - reotyped stages ( Fig . 1a ) 11 , 12 . We examined PIP distribution during cystogenesis through ﬂ uorescent protein - fused PIP - bind - ing domains 20 . In cysts with an open lumen , reporters for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 were cortically distributed with apical enrichment , overlapping with apical Podxl ( Fig . 1b , Supplementary Fig . 1a , white arrowheads ) . In contrast , reporters for PIP 3 were basolateral ( Fig . 1b , Supplementary Fig . 1a , white arrows ) , con ﬁ rming pre - vious results 11 . The PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PIP 3 boundary was marked by Par3 / aPKC ( Fig . 1b , yellow arrowheads ) , the latter combination of which labels the AMIS during lumen initiation 12 . To determine when PIP 3 asymmetry emerges , we examined early lumenogenesis . At all stages , Par3 coincides with PIP 3 depletion . At the cell doublet stage , after initially peripheral Podxl internalized and transcytosed near cell – cell contacts , a single - Par3 punctum formed adjacent to each cell – cell contact ( Fig . 1c , blue arrowheads ) , associated with PIP 3 depletion ( white arrowheads ) . As the AMIS formed , the Par3 - positive / PIP 3 - depleted zone expanded . At the PAP , PIP 3 was further depleted and Par3 relocalized to the PIP 3 / apical boundary ( Fig . 1c , yellow arrow - heads ; Fig . 1b ) . This required the 3 - Phosphatase PTEN , which localizes to the AMIS during polarity formation 21 . PTEN depletion attenuated lumen formation via subcortically stalling apically destined Podxl vesicles ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ‒ d ) . Thus , a PTEN - regulated Par3 - positive / PIP 3 - depleted zone marks the AMIS , the site for apical vesicle delivery . We examined PIP content in transcytosing Podxl vesicles . While demonstrating different localizations , and some adja - cency to Podxl / Rab11a vesicles , none of PI ( 3 ) P , PI ( 4 ) P , PI ( 5 ) P , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , or PIP 3 showed strong localization to apically destined vesicles at the AMIS ( Fig . 1d , yellow arrowheads ) , using multiple reporters where possible ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , e - j ) . In contrast , whereas displaying some nuclear and cytoplasmic ﬂ uorescence , a probe for PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( EGFP - 2xPH - TAPP1 22 ) overlapped speci ﬁ cally with Podxl staining at the apical surface , transcytosing vesicles , and the AMIS ( Fig . 1e , white arrowheads ) . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 may therefore be a regulator of apical domain function . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 localizes to apical recycling endosome membranes . We validated EGFP - 2xPH - TAPP1 as a bona ﬁ de reporter of apical and recycling endosome PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . We developed a Pipe - line for semi - automated phosphoinositide intensity analysis ( PAPI ) , allowing robust identi ﬁ cation of differential PIP locali - zation across hundreds of cyst cultures ( Fig . 2a ) . EGFP - 2xPH - TAPP1 expression , but not a phosphoinositide binding - de ﬁ cient mutant ( Δ PIP , TAPP1 - 2xPH - R211L 22 ) , was signi ﬁ cantly apically enriched , and displayed nuclear recruitment ( Fig . 2b , c ) , though the latter was not signi ﬁ cant over nucleocytoplasmic protein GFP . In contrast , the PIP - mutant probe enriched basolaterally ( Fig . 2c ) . Antibody staining for endogenous PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 displayed similar apical and nuclear localization ( Fig . 2d , e ) , overlapping with the EGFP - 2xPH - TAPP1 probe at the lumen ( Fig . 2f ) , or periphery in cysts with inverted polarity ( Fig . 2g ) , and was asymmetric to basolateral PIP 3 ( Fig . 2h ) . We characterized PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 localization during polarization using the EGFP - 2xPH - TAPP1 probe which we will now refer to as PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . At all stages , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 nuclear labeling is observed , but it will no longer be mentioned for ease of description . In early cyst development , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 showed inverted localization , over - lapping with peripheral Podxl and with Rab11a underneath apical membranes ( Fig . 3a , b , white arrowheads ) . As Rab11a - positive vesicles rearranged towards the AMIS , these showed positivity for PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( Fig . 3a , white arrows , Supplementary Fig . 2a , Supple - mentary Movie 1 ) and Podxl ( Fig . 3b white arrowheads ) , displaying progressive PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 enrichment closer to the AMIS . As development proceeded from the PAP to open lumen , two PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 pools were apparent : Rab11a - positive endosomes ( Fig . 3a , PAP , white arrows ) , and the lumen , the latter marked by F - actin / Podxl ( Fig . 3a , b , white arrowhead ; Supplementary Fig . 2b , ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 07464 - 8 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 5041 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 07464 - 8 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications Supplementary Movie 2 ) . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is thus a component of apical membranes and recycling endosomes . As we saw progressive Rab11a / PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 enrichment in vesicles towards the AMIS , we examined whether transcytosing Podxl transited via other PIP - enriched compartments . While PI ( 3 ) P lacked apparent overlap with Rab11a once lumens formed ( Fig . 3c ) , PI ( 3 ) P - positive compartments ( yellow arrowheads ) closely apposed Podxl / Rab11a vesicles not yet clustered near the AMIS . In these locales occasional triple Rab11a / Podxl / PI ( 3 ) P positivity was observed ( white / red arrows ) . In contrast , PI ( 4 ) P was observed both at the cortex ( Supplementary Fig . 1f ‒ h ) and in Podxl - positive vesicular compartments ( Fig . 3c , yellow / magenta arrows ) , which were separated from Rab11a - / Podxl - positive endosomes ( white / red arrowheads ) . Instead , PI ( 4 ) P - positive structures were always adjacent to Rab11a . Podxl may pass through PI ( 3 ) P / PI ( 4 ) P - positive endosomes en route to the AMIS . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 has emerged as a regulator of clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis 23 – 25 . We observed that caveolin - 1 , but not clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) , co - localized extensively with PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 at the apical membrane at all stages ( Fig . 3d , white arrowheads ; Supplementary Fig . 2c , d ) , a site where the former overlaps with Cavin - 1 ( Supplementary Fig . 2e ) . Though intracel - lular caveolin - 1 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 puncta occurred , these did not overlap ( Fig . 3d , yellow arrowheads ) . These data reveal Rab11a and Caveolin - 1 , as markers of endosomal or apical pools of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , respectively . PIP - modifying enzyme networks control polarization . PIPs are made through combinatorial , reversible phosphorylation events 19 ( Fig . 4a ) . We examined known PIP - modifying enzyme expression during polarization ( Fig . 4b ) . 3D embedding of MDCK induces transcriptional reprogramming to express machinery required for 3D polarization 15 . We reasoned that this might extend to PIP - modifying enzymes . Comparison between monolayers ( 2D ) and 3D cysts ( 23 h , 48 h ) revealed extensive transcriptional changes to PIP - modifying networks , in a temporal fashion in 3D ( Fig . 4b , Supplementary Fig . 3a ) .

As neither OCRL or INPP5E localize at the AMIS or show overlap with Podxl , it is unclear how it controls PIP 3 > PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 conversion . We thus turned our attention to SHIP1 . SHIP1 converts a cell – cell contact into an AMIS . SHIP1 is a 5 - phosphatase that converts PIP 3 into PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 26 , thereby trig - gering PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - dependent fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis 23 . SHIP1 showed robust , early upregulation in 3D ( Fig . 4b ) . During polarization , SHIP1 - EGFP co - localized with β - catenin - positive basolateral domains ( Fig . 4c , blue arrowheads ) , becoming excluded from the forming lumen at the PAP stage ( yellow arrowheads ) . Unexpectedly , after lumen formation , SHIP1 - EGFP relocalized apically ( yellow arrowheads ) . SHIP1 dynamic relocalization thus coincides with cortical depletion of its substrate , PIP 3 . We inhibited SHIP1 by chemical and genetic means . To ensure robust polarity phenotype detection , we built a Pipeline for semi - automated polarity analysis , PAPA , quantifying hundreds to thousands of cysts per condition ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) , and performing comparably to manual quantitation ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . SHIP1 chemical inhibition 27 at the time of plating strongly disrupted lumen formation , causing subcortical apical vesicle retention ( Fig . 4d , Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . In contrast , chemical inhibition of SHIP1 after lumens formed failed to perturb cell polarity ( Fig . 4d ) , in line with requirement to convert basolateral PIP 3 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 only during AMIS formation . Endogenous SHIP1 depletion resulted in similar phenotypes ( Fig . 4e – g ) . Control cysts displayed luminal Podxl ( Fig . 4h , blue arrowheads ) , PIP 3 reporter or β - catenin at basolateral membranes , and Par3 at the boundary between these zones ( Fig . 4h , yellow arrowheads ) . SHIP1 depletion resulted in defective lumen formation and aberrant retention of PIP 3 , Par3 , and β - catenin adjacent to rudimentary lumens ( Fig . 4h , white arrowheads ) . SHIP1 PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - producing activity was required as only expression of RNAi - resistant WT , but not phosphatase - de ﬁ cient , SHIP1 reversed SHIP1 depletion phenotypes ( Fig . 4h , i ) . In contrast , ﬁ lter - grown 2D monolayers displayed no defects in apical - basal polarization upon SHIP1 depletion ( Supple - mentary Fig . 4a ) . SHIP1 is therefore a regulator of de novo apical membrane biogenesis in 3D . We utilized PAPI to examine cortical PIP [ PI ( 4 ) P , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and PIP 3 ] level and distribution after SHIP1 inhibition ( Fig . 5a – d ) . This con ﬁ rmed exclusive localization of apical PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , cortical with apical enrichment PI ( 4 ) P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and basolateral PIP 3 ( Fig . 5a – d ) . SHIP1 inhibition caused a signi ﬁ cant , localized response , increasing basolateral PIP 3 ( Fig . 5b ) . We examined whether attenuating PIP 3 generation ( Class - I PI3 - Kinase inhibition ) could reverse the effect of PIP 3 stabilization ( SHIP1 inhibition ) . PI3 - kinase inhibition ( PI3K - i ) has pleiotropic effects in 3D , as PIP 3 regulates growth and polarity orientation 28 – 31 , but also must be depleted at the AMIS . Class - I PI3K inhibition increases lumen formation in a popula - tion of cysts which display smaller size , and inversion of polarity in another pool ( Fig . 5e – h ) . Consistent with a role in stabilizing PIP 3 levels , SHIP1 inhibition ( SHIP1 - i ) signi ﬁ cantly increased cyst size , attenuated lumen formation and caused a mild , though signi ﬁ cant , increase in polarity inversion . Combined SHIP1 / PI3K inhibition failed to rescue polarity inversion , but completely rescued effects of SHIP1 on lumen formation and a signi ﬁ cant , partial rescue of size ( Fig . 5e – h ) . Regulation of basolateral PIP 3 levels , and its metabolism into PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , are therefore essential to form a lumen de novo . We examined whether exogenous PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 supply would promote lumen formation ( Fig . 5i ) . Strikingly , addition of exogenous PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 to cysts signi ﬁ cantly increased lumen formation without affecting polarity inversion , but only if SHIP1 was not inhibited . Thus , while AMIS - localized PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 generation promotes lumen formation , co - depletion of PIP 3 is essential . Class - II PI3 - kinases contribute to apical polarization . Follow - ing PIP 3 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 conversion at the AMIS , SHIP1 was dis - pensable for polarity ( Fig . 4d ) . We examined the contribution of the endosomal PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 pool to lumen formation . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 can also be generated from PI ( 4 ) P by Class - II PI3 - kinases 24 , 32 . We noted upregulation of PIK3C2G in 3D , and downregulation of PIK3C2A / B ( Fig . 4b ) . Unexpectedly , PIK3C2A and PIK3C2B depletion perturbed lumen formation , whereas depletion of PIK3C2G modestly promoted lumen formation ( Fig . 6a – c ) . PIK3C2A / B co - depletion robustly inhibited lumen formation ( Fig . 6a – c ) . Thus , PIK3C2A / B are non - redundant lumen forma - tion regulators . PIK3C2A / B displayed distinct localizations , though both overlapped with different pools of Rab11a . GFP - PIK3C2A was closely associated with Rab11a vesicles throughout polarization ( Fig . 6d ) . A pool of GFP - PIK3C2B was basolateral and Fig . 2 Validation of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 localization . a Schematic representation of a Pipeline for semi - automated phosphoinositide intensity analysis , PAPI .

GFP - PIK3C2B was initially at doublet cell – cell contacts , but became progressively removed from the forming AMIS ( Fig . 6f ) . In cysts with an open lumen , GFP - PIK3C2B could be seen both at the basolateral membrane and in vesicular compartments near Rab11a . Thus , PIK3C2A is constitutively Rab11a - endosome adjacent , while PIK3C2B may be involved in cortical Rab11a events controlling apical polarization .

Thus , PIK3C2A / B may promote lumen formation from different pools , with the Rab11a / PIK3C2A pool increasing de novo apical domain generation . INPP4A / B are negative regulators of apical polarization . As lumen formation ef ﬁ ciency could be both increased and decreased , we looked for potential tonic PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 regulators . The 4 - phosphatases INPP4A / B , which can convert PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 to PI ( 3 ) P 33 , were initially downregulated in 3D , with INPP4A re - induced at 48 h ( Fig . 4b ) . Ectopic expression of INPP4B signi ﬁ cantly attenuated single lumen formation , causing subcortical Podxl vesicle accumulation , in a phosphatase - dependent fashion ( Fig . 7a – c ) . Conversely , depletion of INPP4A / B alone or together increased lumen formation ( Fig . 7d – f ) , mirroring PIK3C2A overexpression ( Fig . 6g ) . Unlike PIK3C2A overexpression how - ever , INPP4A / B depletion alone or together failed to rescue the effect of SHIP1 inhibition ( Fig . 7f ) . Thus , transcriptional down - regulation of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - depleting enzymes is essential for de novo lumenogenesis . The apical Par complex is PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - independent . We aimed to identify the functional consequence of apical PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 genera - tion . The PTEN - mediated production of apical PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 from PIP 3 controls the function of the aPKC / Par6 / Cdc42 module in association with apical Annexin2 11 . In contrast , SHIP1 - mediated PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 production did not affect aPKC level or activation ( Fig . 8a ) , Annexin2 apical , cortical or apical - basal localization ratio ( Fig . 8b , c ) , recruitment of Cdc42 onto Podxl / Rab11a - positive vesicles ( Fig . 8d ) , activation levels of Cdc42 at the apical membrane ( Fig . 8e ) or recruitment of WT or mutationally active Cdc42 to the cortex , to the apical domain or the apical - basal ratio ( Fig . 8f ) . Thus , production of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 from PIP 3 at the AMIS by SHIP1 does not regulate the apical aPKC / Cdc42 / Par3 complex . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - SNX9 interaction is essential for lumen formation . To identify PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - interacting protein ( s ) regulating polariza - tion , we examined whether INPP4B overexpression disrupted known PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 interactor localization 24 . We focused on labeling endogenous proteins , to preclude counteraction of INPP4B overexpression by exogenous effector protein co - overexpression . We detected that endogenous SNX9 , a protein involved in PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - dependent endocytosis , was present in subapical puncta that were lost upon INPP4B overexpression ( Fig . 9a ) . Depletion of SNX9 phenocopied SHIP1 depletion or INPP4B overexpression , resulting in subcortical Podxl accumulation and defective lumen formation ( Fig . 9a – c ) . Unlike WT SNX9 expression , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 binding - de ﬁ cient SNX9 mutants 24 failed to reverse the effect of SNX9 depletion ( Fig . 9d – f ) . Combining SNX9 depletion with PIP - binding - de ﬁ cient SNX9 expression caused subcortical vesi - cular accumulation of non - overlapping pools of Podxl and β - catenin , but both of which did overlap with mutant SNX9 . Therefore , the formation of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 at the AMIS is essential for SNX9 to remodel basolateral components to form an apical domain de novo . Discussion We describe a transcriptionally regulated PIP - modifying enzyme network essential for lumen formation . Notably , the enzymes required in 2D and 3D are not interchangeable , though both conditions are apical - basal polarized . This revealed an unantici - pated role for the PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 as a determinant of 3D apical identity . Speci ﬁ c to the 3D context is basolateral cell – cell contact remo - deling into an apical domain 12 . Several PIP - modifying enzymes participate in this process . The doublet cell – cell contact contains a PI → PI ( 4 ) P → PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 → PIP 3 cascade that generates basolateral identity ( for model , see Fig . 10a – c ) . During polarity rearrangement , PTEN locally reverses the last step in the PIP 3 cascade , inducing a PIP 3 depletion zone : the AMIS 11 , 21 ( Fig . 10b ) . Due to this early apical enrichment , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was described as an apical targeting fac - tor 34 . However , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is also basolateral . Our current data suggest an updated model wherein lack of PIP 3 , rather than the mere presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , encodes part of apical identity . We report that the long - unidenti ﬁ ed apical domain identity determinant is PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , which is enriched apically and on recycling endosomes . That PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is asymmetric in localization and function to PIP 3 is unexpected . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 was considered as part of PIP 3 signaling cascades , given that both lipids bind the Akt PH domain in vitro 35 . Such studies have examined PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 in single or poorly polarized cells , where apical domains may not occur . The functions and asymmetry of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 may have been underappreciated in such contexts . How is PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 generated ? At least two pools of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 exist and these dynamically rearrange during polarization : Rab11a endosomes and apical surfaces . In early cell doublets ( Fig . 10a ) , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is enriched at the periphery with apical proteins . As polarity reorientation is triggered , Podxl - positive vesicles transcytosed to the AMIS . These vesicles initially contain PI ( 3 ) P / PI ( 4 ) P , before enriching with PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and Rab11a as Podxl clusters at the AMIS . The class - II PI3 - kinases PIK3C2A / B , which generate PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 from PI ( 4 ) P in other contexts 24 , 32 , may promote formation of endosomal PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , though acting in different locales : PIK3C2B localizes with Rab11a puncta close to the cortex , whereas PIK3C2A localizes closely opposed to trans - cytosing Rab11a . Rab11a and PIK3C2A likely co - operate to promote PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 as overexpression of either , or exogenous supply of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , increases lumen formation rates . Indeed , PIK3C2A controls Rab11a activation in other systems 36 . It is Fig . 3 PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is an apical - and recycling endosome - enriched lipid . a , b PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 localization during different stages of lumen formation ( 12 – 48 h ) in MDCK cells stably co - expressing EGFP - 2xPH - TAPP1 [ PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 sensor , green ] and either a TagRFPT - Rab11a WT ( red ) and stained for F - actin ( blue ) , or b Podxl ( red ) and stained for β - catenin ( blue ) .

Ectopic re - expression of INPP4B disrupts apical polarization in a phosphatase - dependent fashion . Con - comitant with transcytosing apically destined vesicles , tran - scriptionally upregulated SHIP1 is responsible for the initial conversion of basolateral PIP 3 at the AMIS into PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . Once this event occurs , SHIP1 is now dispensable for polarity , and the apical enrichment of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is likely reinforced by delivery of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - positive Rab11a vesicles . PTEN can also function as a PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 phosphatase 37 . Given that PTEN is enriched at the forming AMIS 21 , whether it is acting solely on PIP 3 or also on PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is unknown . If both are occurring , the AMIS localization of PIK3C2B may help to focally reverse this dual speci ﬁ city , leading to co - enrichment of apical PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . The exact function of PTEN at the AMIS thus warrants further attention .

In contrast to PTEN - mediated PIP 3 to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 conversion , SHIP1 - mediated PIP 3 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 conversion did not affect apical aPKC - Cdc42 activity . In cells in 2D , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 regulates cell motility , and both clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis 23 – 25 , 38 , 39 . In our system , apical PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 most closely overlapped with Caveolin - 1 , and not clathrin , suggest - ing a clathrin - independent pathway may remodel basolateral cargo proteins through endocytosis to allow the AMIS to form . Accordingly , perturbing PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 levels or its interaction with SNX9 results in the subcortical vesicular localization of both apical and basolateral cargoes . One function of cortical PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , in addition to promoting a zone for apical exocy - tosis , may be to promote endocytosis of basolateral proteins at the AMIS . The function of recycling endosome - localized PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is unknown , but may be to recruit other sorting nexins , such as the apical exocytosis - promoting SNX9 homologue , SNX18 17 . If PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is both in recycling endosomes and the apical domain , how can it be an apical determinant ? It may be that discrimination between these two PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - positive compart - ments is provided by the absence or presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , respectively . Such a combinatorial PIP code for membrane identity greatly expands the possible number of compartment identities than can be generated by the seven PIPs alone . In line with this , although exogenous addition of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 enhanced lumen formation ef ﬁ ciency , it could only do so when SHIP1 was functional . The apical identity code may therefore be the presence of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and the absence of PIP 3 . In support of this , exogenous PIP 3 addition to an apical membrane causes rapid conversion to basolateral identity 28 . The recycling endosome code may rather be PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 without PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Our studies underpin that whereas there are in theory multiple ways to make a PIP , these are transcriptionally and spatio - temporally regulated during development . What is important to note is that PIP production and morphogenesis go hand - in - hand : inhibiting SHIP1 - mediated PIP 3 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 conversion results in basolateral domains with more PIP 3 , but not with apical domains with less PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . Rather , an apical domain will not form if suf ﬁ cient apical PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is not generated , or if cortical PIP 3 is not removed . This represents a conceptual difference from 2D studies where the cortex is a constant structure where PIP levels can change . In multicellular 3D contexts , such changes in cortical PIP levels induces alternate morphogenesis , such as conferring apical or basolateral identity . In addition to their function in cell polarization , phosphoino - sitides participate in cell growth and survival pathways 18 , 40 . For instance , correct cell polarization may lay upstream to decisions of cell death or survival during morphogenesis . Likewise , per - turbation of PIP - modifying enzymes , such as the PTEN or INPP4B loss observed in cancer 40 , 41 , may be facilitative of the disrupted polarity and overgrowth of tumors . The extent to which these processes are distinct pathways or are intimately linked remains unclear . We describe an unappreciated function of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 in apical domain morphogenesis in MDCK cysts . Although an in vitro reductionist system , the molecular mechanisms elucidated in MDCK cysts have been demonstrated as conserved in a variety of other systems 4 – 9 . Yet , there are several developmental mechan - isms for lumen formation ; the polarized exocytosis and mem - brane remodeling we describe here can be bypassed by apoptotic cavitation of multicellular clusters or folding and joining of tissue sheets 1 , 42 . In these instances , we predict that apical PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is likely supplied by the endosomal pool , rather than conversion from basolateral PIP 3 by SHIP1 . In spite of differences in the way it can form , the apical domain is essential for exchange of pro - teins , nutrients , solutes and lipids . Given , for example , that the kidney lumen is an extremely active site of endocytosis in vivo , that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 has emerged as a regulator of rapid endocytosis aligns with such a physiological requirement 23 – 25 . It will thus now be important to determine the involvement and regulation of apical and recycling endosome PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 in development and disease . Methods Cell and cyst culture .

Primary and secondary anti - body incubation in blocking buffer were performed in the conditions speci ﬁ ed above , followed by three washes in blocking buffer . List of used antibodies , in Supplementary Table 1 . Image acquisition and analysis , PAPA and PAPI . Confocal images were acquired either on Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan confocal microscope , a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal , or an Opera Phenix Z9501 high - content imaging system ( PerkinElmer ) . 3D culture has the imaging challenge of sparsely positioned objects ( cysts ) that can be posi - tioned in different Z - planes . This has previously required manual imaging of each object , precluding large sample number analyses . We have overcome this by building two analysis pipelines to allow quantitation of cyst phenotypes or phos - phoinositide distribution from hundreds to thousands of 3D cysts per condition : ( 1 ) a Pipeline for semi - Automated Polarity Analysis , PAPA , and ( 2 ) a Pipeline for semi - Automated Phosphoinositide Intensity analysis , PAPI . PAPA and PAPI make use of an Opera Phenix Z9501 high - content imaging system ( PerkinElmer ) . To direct imaging only to cysts ( and not the surrounding non - cyst areas ) we used the PreciScan module ( PerkinElmer ) to scan entire wells to ﬁ nd cysts by performing z - stacks of each well at ×5 magni ﬁ cation , on - the - ﬂ y processing of images using user - de ﬁ ned rules to identify cysts , and then directing the microscope to perform high - resolution z - stacks of objects ( cysts ) . In the case of PAPI , this requires cysts to express GFP - tagged PIP probes above a baseline level de ﬁ ned as optimum for imaging . At this step , we perform at least 8 optical sections every 2 µM , imaging at least 25 ﬁ elds or objects ( ×20 and ×63 , respectively ) . For PAPA , cysts are stained for apical marker ( Podxl ) , the cortex ( Phalloidin ) , whole - cell stain ( cytoplasm ) , and nuclei ( Hoescht ) . For PAPI , GFP - tagged PIP reporters were imaged in place of whole cell stain . For PAPA , as lumens can occur in different Z - planes of a given cyst , a maximum projection of the medial Z - planes was applied . Using Harmony imaging analysis software ( PerkinElmer ) , user - de ﬁ ned phenotype classi ﬁ cation rules to detect polarity orientation based on the localization and intensity of apical markers and the detection and quanti ﬁ cation of number of lumens was applied to each cyst . For benchmarking of accuracy , PAPA was compared to manual imaging and counting of polarity phenotypes for control vs SHIP1 - inhibited cysts . PAPA produced concordant quantitation of phenotypes to expert manual quantitation . For PAPI , as maximum projection of different Z - planes could introduce quanti ﬁ cation artefacts , analyses were performed only on the most medial Z - plane , which was automatically calculated based on the maximal luminal area . To detect PIP probe intensity in different subcellular locales , cysts were ﬁ xed and stained with Podxl to mark the apical domain , Phalloidin to mark the cortex , and Hoescht to mark the nucleus . Combinations of these stainings were used to create masked regions to calculate mean total , cortical , apical , basolateral , cytoplasmic ( excludes nuclear region ) , and nuclear intensity per area in each region . For depiction of these regions , see Fig . 2a . Note that for all images taken at super - resolution for subcellular analysis , such as co - localization between Rab11 and PIPs or PIP - modifying enzymes , a Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan confocal microscope was used from a single plane only . Statistical analysis was performed to calculate percentages of polarity phenotypes , normalized to control , and the relative PIP intensity in different cellular regions . Data were processed using KNIME analytics platform , and GraphPad Prism to generate graphs . Statistics . Cyst phenotypes were binned into four categories : ( a ) single lumen , ( b ) multiple lumens / vesicular accumulation of Podxl , ( c ) inverted polarity , ( d ) other / no lumen . Relative percentages were normalized to control . For RNAi rescue experiments , only cysts expressing exogenous transgene were scored . Relative percentages from each category were normalized to control . Values are mean± S . D . from 3 to 9 replicate experiments , with n ≥ 300 cysts per replicate , unless otherwise indicated . For qPCR , expression was normalized as fold change ( log2 ) from the mean expression for all conditions . Signi ﬁ cance was calculated using a paired , two - tailed Student ' s t - test , Mann – Whitney test , one - way ANOVA or two - way ANOVA test . No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size . No ran - domizations were used . The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment . Statistical tests used are stated on every ﬁ gure legend with P - values as appropriate . Data distribution should meet the normal distribution requirements . No estimate of variation . Data were analyzed using KNIME analytics platform , Excel ( Microsoft ) or Prism ( Graphpad ) . Live cell dual - color imaging . Live imaging was performed on cysts in eight - well chamber slides ( Labtek II , Nunc ) . Cysts co - expressing EGFP - 2xPH - TAPP1 and either TagRFP - T - Rab11a or Membrane - tdTomato were imaged on an inverted spinning - disk confocal microscope system ( Yokogawa / Zeiss ) with a 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 controlled environment ( Zeiss ) and heated stage ( PECON ) through a 20× 1 . 49NA lens ( Zeiss ) , using 488 / 561 nm laser lines . Images were captured via an AxioCam Mrm ( Zeiss ) . A stack of three images at 5µm intervals was taken using an automated stage controlled via the ZEN software package ( Zeiss ) . As cysts develop and move during image acquisition , the optimal focal plane was manually chosen for each time point post - acquisition from the stacked images , before compilation of image series of each movie . Movies and images were processed using ImageJ ( NIH ) , as adapted from Stehbens et al . 45 . Brie ﬂ y , the functions ‘ Remove Outliers ’ ( radius , 2 ; threshold , 5 ) , and ‘ Unsharp Mask ’ ( radius , 7 ; mask , 0 . 5 ) were applied to improve image contrast . RNAi . Lentiviral shRNAs were used to stably deplete proteins , described in Virus production and transduction methods section . ShRNA sequences were generated using iRNA software , as per Addgene ( https : / / www . addgene . org / tools / protocols / plko / ) . RNAi target sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 2 . Knockdown was veri ﬁ ed by western blot or RT - qPCR procedures , normalized to GAPDH expression . Due to the canine origin of MDCK , shRNAs were custom - designed , and RNAi sequences chosen not to match human were utilized when rescuing with transgenes . RT - qPCR . For detection of phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases expression or for shRNA - mediated knockdown veri ﬁ cation , RT - qPCR was used . Primers were designed based on the canine genome using Primer3Plus software and are listed in Supplementary Table 3 . RT - qPCR was performed using EXPRESS One - Step SYBR ® GreenER ™ Universal ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) per manufacturer ’ s instructions . Virus production and transduction . All lentiviruses were derived from the pLKO backbone . Plasmids were either co - transfected with Virapower packaging mix ( Invitrogen ) or co - transfected with pSPAX2 and pVSVG packaging plas - mids , both using Lipofectamine 2000 into 293 - FT cells according to manufac - turer ' s instructions ( Invitrogen ) . Viral supernatants were collected 2 and 3 days after transfection , then clari ﬁ ed of cell debris using PES 0 . 45 µm syringe ﬁ lters ( Starlab ) and concentrated using Lenti - X concentrator ( Takara ) , following manufacturer ’ s instructions . For retroviruses , viral supernatants were collected daily from days 5 to 7 after transfection of 293 - GPG packaging cells . After centrifugation twice at 3500× g to remove cell debris , supernatants were snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen . For lentiviral transductions , MDCK cultures 18 h after plating were infected with viral supernatants for 12 – 16 h at 37 °C . Next , supernatants were diluted 1 : 1 with growth medium , cultured for a further 48 h at 37 °C , then passaged into appropriate antibiotic - containing medium . For retroviral transductions , cells 12 – 16 h post plating were incubated with viral supernatants supplemented with 10 μ g ml − 1 Polybrene ( Millipore ) for 24 h at Fig . 5 Regulation of PIP 3 basolateral levels is essential for de novo lumen formation . a Representative picture of cysts overexpressing speci ﬁ ed PIP reporters . b – d Quantitation of relative basolateral to total b , apical to cytoplasm c , or apical to basolateral d PIP reporter intensity .

Shortly after plating into 3D , single MDCK cells undergo morphogenesis to form a cell doublet with initially inverted polarity a , whereby the apical surface marked by Podxl abuts the ECM . At this stage , a PI ( 4 ) P > PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 > PIP 3 cascade de ﬁ nes the cell – cell contact , while PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is inverted . b To reorient polarity , peripheral Podxl internalizes into vesicles which are initially PI ( 3 ) P and / or PI ( 4 ) P positive , before progressively enriching to become PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 / Rab11a - positive . These vesicles target to the apical membrane initiation site ( AMIS ) . The PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - promoting Class - II PI3Ks PIK3C2A / B promote , whereas the PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - degrading phosphatases INPP4A / B inhibit , this process . Concomitantly , the AMIS is formed by two PIP phosphatases , PTEN and SHIP1 , which focally convert PIP 3 into , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , respectively to form this zone for apical vesicle delivery . c Upon delivery of transcytosing Podxl , de novo lumen formation is completed , leaving cortical PI ( 4 ) P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , basolateral PIP 3 , and apical and recycling endosome PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 07464 - 8 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 5041 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 07464 - 8 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 15 Immunoblotting . Protein blotting was adapted from previous protocols 13 . Ice - cold extraction buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2mM EGTA , and 1 % Triton X - 100 plus 50mM NaF , 1mM Na 3 VO 4 and complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablet ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) ) on ice for 5 min was used for cell solubilization . Cells were then scrapped and passed through a 27½ - gauge needle before extraction at 4°C for 25 min . Clari ﬁ cation of post - nuclear supernatants was performed by centrifugation at 14 , 000 × g at 4°C for 10 min . SDS - PAGE was used to separate samples , followed by transfer to PVDF mem - branes . Western analysis was performed using either chemiluminescence ( Super - Signal Chemiluminescence Kit ; Pierce , Rockford , IL ) or infrared ﬂ uorescent secondary antibodies and quantitative detection ( Odyssey CLx , Li - COR Bios - ciences ) . A BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit ( Pierce ) was used to determine protein concentration . Transfer and protein loading were monitored by staining 0 . 1 % Coomassie Brilliant Blue . Statistical analysis of western blots and generation of accompanying graphs were performed using Excel ( Microsoft ) or Prism ( Graph - pad ) . Uncropped membranes are presented in Supplementary Figure 5 . Delivery of exogenous PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . Exogenous PIP was delivered to cysts as pre - viously reported 11 with appropriate adaptations : PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and Histone carriers ( Shuttle PIP TM , Echelon , Salt Lake City , UT ) were freshly prepared in PIP solution ( 150mM NaCl , 4mM KCl , 20 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 2 ) to a ﬁ nal concentration of 300 or 100 µM , respectively . Complexes were combined for 10 min , and diluted 1 : 10 in Hank ’ s buffered salt solution , solution added for 30min to MDCK cysts that had previously been cultured in 3D for 48 h .
