Articles nAture methods | VOL . 10 NO . 12 | DECEMBER 2013 | 1213 We describe an assay for transposase - accessible chromatin using sequencing ( AtAc - seq ) , based on direct in vitro transposition of sequencing adaptors into native chromatin , as a rapid and sensitive method for integrative epigenomic analysis . AtAc - seq captures open chromatin sites using a simple two - step protocol with 500 – 50 , 000 cells and reveals the interplay between genomic locations of open chromatin , dnA - binding proteins , individual nucleosomes and chromatin compaction at nucleotide resolution . We discovered classes of dnA - binding factors that strictly avoided , could tolerate or tended to overlap with nucleosomes . using AtAc - seq maps of human cd4 + t cells from a proband obtained on consecutive days , we demonstrated the feasibility of analyzing an individual’s epigenome on a timescale compatible with clinical decision - making . Eukaryotic genomes are hierarchically packaged into chromatin 1 , and the nature of this packaging plays a central role in gene regu - lation 2 , 3 . Major insights into the epigenetic information encoded within the nucleoprotein structure of chromatin have come from high - throughput , genome - wide methods for separately assaying chromatin accessibility ( ‘open chromatin’ ) 4 , 5 , nucleosome posi - tioning 6 – 8 and transcription factor ( TF ) occupancy 9 . Though they are powerful , published protocols for existing methods require millions of cells as starting material , involve complex and time - consuming sample preparations , and cannot probe the interplay of nucleosome positioning , chromatin accessibility and TF binding simultaneously . These limitations give rise to three shortcomings . First , current methods can average over and ‘drown out’ hetero - geneity in cellular populations . Second , cells must often be grown ex vivo to obtain sufficient material , and such conditions perturb the in vivo context and modulate the epigenetic state in unknown ways . Third , input requirements often prevent application of these assays to well - defined clinical samples , thereby precluding generation of ‘personal epigenomes’ on diagnostic timescales . Here we report a robust and sensitive method for epigenomic profiling that can provide a multidimensional portrait of gene transposition of native chromatin for fast and sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin , dnA - binding proteins and nucleosome position Jason D Buenrostro 1 – 3 , Paul G Giresi 2 , 3 , Lisa C Zaba 2 , 3 , Howard Y Chang 2 , 3 & William J Greenleaf 1 regulation . We used ATAC - seq to identify regions of open chro - matin , identify nucleosome - bound and nucleosome - free positions in regulatory regions , and infer the positions of DNA - binding proteins using ‘footprinting’ in a B - cell line . We demonstrated that this method is compatible with clinical timescales and stand - ard blood draws by observing the open - chromatin landscape of a healthy volunteer . resultsAtAc - seq probes chromatin accessibility with transposomes Hyperactive Tn5 transposase 10 , 11 , loaded in vitro with adaptors for high - throughput DNA sequencing , can simultaneously frag - ment and tag a genome with sequencing adaptors ( previously described as “tagmentation” 11 ) . Because transposons have been shown to integrate into active regulatory elements in vivo 12 , we hypothesized that transposition by purified Tn5 , a prokaryotic transposase , on small numbers of unfixed eukaryotic nuclei would interrogate regions of accessible chromatin . In ATAC - seq , Tn5 transposase integrates its adaptor payload into regions of accessi - ble chromatin , whereas steric hindrance in less accessible chroma - tin makes such transposition less probable . Therefore , amplifiable DNA fragments suitable for high - throughput sequencing are pref - erentially generated at locations of open chromatin ( Fig . 1a ) . The entire assay and library construction can be carried out in a simple protocol involving Tn5 insertion followed by PCR . In contrast , published DNase - seq and formaldehyde - assisted isolation of regulatory elements with sequencing ( FAIRE - seq ) methods for assaying chromatin accessibility involve multistep protocols 13 , 14 and many potentially loss - prone steps , such as adaptor ligation , gel purification and cross - link reversal . We carried out ATAC - seq on sets of 50 , 000 and 500 unfixed nuclei isolated from the GM12878 human lymphoblastoid cell line ( Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ( ENCODE ) Tier 1 ; ref . 15 ) for comparison and validation with chromatin - accessibility data sets , including DNase - seq 13 and FAIRE - seq 16 , which were gen - erated from 1 – 50 million cells ( Fig . 1b ) . At a locus previously highlighted by others 5 ( Fig . 1c ) , ATAC - seq had a signal - to - noise 1 Department of Genetics , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , California , USA . 2 Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , California , USA . 3 Program in Epithelial Biology , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , California , USA .

Peak intensities were highly reproducible between technical replicates ( R = 0 . 98 ) and highly correlated between ATAC - seq and two different sources of DNase - seq data ( R = 0 . 79 and R = 0 . 83 ; Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , and the majority of reads within peaks came from intersections of DNase and ATAC - seq peaks ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We compared our data to DNase - hypersensitive sites identified in ENCODE DNase - seq data : receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated a similar sensitivity and specificity for ATAC - seq and DNase - seq ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . ATAC - seq peak intensi - ties also correlated well with markers of active chromatin and not with transposase sequence preference ( Supplementary Figs . 4 and 5 ) . Highly sensitive open - chromatin detection was main - tained even when using 5 , 000 or 500 human nuclei as starting material ( Supplementary Figs . 3 and 6 ) , although sensitivity was diminished for smaller numbers of input material . AtAc - seq insert sizes disclose nucleosome positions We found that ATAC - seq paired - end reads produced detailed information about nucleosome packing and positioning . The insert size distribution of sequenced fragments from human chro - matin had clear periodicity of approximately 200 bp , suggesting many fragments are protected by integer multiples of nucleo - somes ( Fig . 2a ) . This fragment size distribution also showed clear periodicity equal to the helical pitch of DNA 11 . By parti - tioning the insert size distribution according to functional classes of chromatin as defined by previous models 17 and normalizing to the global insert distribution ( Online Methods ) , we observed clear class - specific enrichments across this insert size distribution ( Fig . 2b ) . This result demonstrated that these functional states of chromatin have an accessibility fingerprint that can be read out with ATAC - seq . The differen - tial fragmentation patterns were consist - ent with the putative functional state of these classes : CCCTC - binding factor ( CTCF ) - bound regions were enriched for short fragments of DNA , whereas transcription start sites ( TSSs ) were dif - ferentially depleted for mono - , di - and trinucleosome – associated fragments . Transcribed and promoter - flanking regions were enriched for longer multinucleosomal frag - ments , a result suggesting that such regions represent a form of chromatin that is less accessible than that of TSSs .

Indeed we found that repressed , untranscribed regions ( as defined by the chromatin state model ) are depleted for short fragments and enriched for phased multinucleosomal inserts , which is consistent with their expected inaccessible state . These data suggest that ATAC - seq reveals differentially accessible forms of chromatin , which have been long hypothesized to exist in vivo 2 , 20 , 21 . To explore nucleosome positioning within accessible chroma - tin in the GM12878 cell line , we partitioned our data into reads generated from putative nucleosome - free regions of DNA and reads likely derived from nucleosome - associated DNA ( Online Methods and Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Using a simple heuristic that positively weights nucleosome - associated fragments and negatively weights nucleosome - free fragments ( Online Methods ) , we calculated a data track used to call nucleosome positions within regions of accessible chromatin 22 . An example locus ( Fig . 3a ) contains a putative bidirectional promoter with cap analysis of gene expression ( CAGE ) data showing two TSSs separated by ~ 700 bp . ATAC - seq revealed in fact two distinct nucleosome - free regions separated by a single well - positioned mononucleosome ( Fig . 3a ) . Compared to micrococcal nuclease digestion followed by sequencing ( MNase - seq ) 23 data , ATAC - seq data were more amenable to detecting nucleosomes within puta - tive regulatory regions , as the majority of reads were concentrated within accessible regions of chromatin ( Fig . 3b ) . By averaging signal across all active TSSs , we found that nucleosome - free frag - ments were enriched at a canonical nucleosome - free promoter region overlapping the TSS , whereas our nucleosome signal was Position ( bp ) a 82 % 18 % TSS NucleosomesNFR 35 % 65 % Distal Median NFR size : 239 bp Median NFR size : 86 bp c d ENCODE CAGE RefSeq genes ATAC - seq ; nucleosome - free reads ATAC - seq ; nucleosome signal MNase - seq DNase ( UW ) H3K27ac H3K4me3 H2A .

Because ATAC - seq reads are con - centrated at regions of open chromatin , we saw a strong nucleo - some signal at the + 1 nucleosome that decreased at the + 2 , + 3 and + 4 nucleosomes . In contrast , MNase - seq nucleosome signal increased at larger distances from the TSS , likely owing to overdi - gestion of more accessible nucleosomes . Additionally , MNase - seq ( 4 billion reads ) assays all nucleosomes , whereas reads generated from ATAC - seq ( 198 million paired reads ) are concentrated at regulatory nucleosomes ( Fig . 3b , c ) . Using our nucleosome calls , we further partitioned putative distal regulatory regions and TSSs into regions that were nucleosome free and regions that were predicted to be nucleosome bound . We note that TSSs were enriched for nucleosome - free regions when compared to distal elements , which tend to remain nucleosome rich ( Fig . 3d ) . These data suggest ATAC - seq can provide high - resolution readouts of nucleosome - associated and nucleosome - free regions in regula - tory elements genome wide . AtAc - seq reveals patterns of nucleosome - tF spacing Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) data , we plotted the position of a variety of DNA - binding factors with respect to the dyad of the nearest nucleosome derived from ATAC - seq data . Unsupervised hierarchical clustering ( Fig . 3e ) revealed major classes of binding with respect to the prox - imal nucleosome , including ( i ) a strongly nucleosome - avoiding group of factors with binding events stereotyped at ~ 180 bases from the nearest nucleosome dyad ( comprising C - FOS , NFYA and IRF3 ) , ( ii ) a class of factors that ‘nestle up’ next to the expected end of nucleosome DNA contacts , which notably includes chro - matin looping factor CTCF and cohesin - complex subunits RAD21 and SMC3 , ( iii ) a large class primarily of TFs that have gradations of nucleosome - avoiding or nucleosome - overlapping binding behavior and ( iv ) a class whose binding sites tend to overlap nucleosome - associated DNA . Interestingly , this final class includes chromatin - remodeling factors such as CHD1 and SIN3A as well as RNA polymerase II , which appears to be enriched at the nucleosome boundary 8 . The interplay between precise nucleo - some positioning and locations of DNA - binding factor immedi - ately suggests specific hypotheses for mechanistic studies . AtAc - seq footprints infer factor occupancy genome wide We reasoned that DNA sequences directly occupied by DNA - binding proteins are protected from transposition ; the resulting sequence ‘footprint’ reveals the presence of a DNA - binding pro - tein at each site , analogous to DNase digestion footprints 24 . At a specific CTCF - binding site on chromosome 1 , we observed a clear footprint ( a deep notch of ATAC - seq signal ) similar to footprints seen with DNase - seq 25 , 26 , at the precise location of the CTCF motif that coincides with the summit of the CTCF ChIP - seq signal in GM12878 cells ( Fig . 4a ) . We averaged ATAC - seq signal over all expected locations of CTCF within the genome and observed a well - stereotyped footprint ( Fig . 4b ) . Similar results were obtained for a variety of common TFs ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . We inferred the CTCF binding probability from motif consensus score , evo - lutionary conservation and ATAC - seq insertion data to generate a posterior probability of CTCF binding at all loci 27 ( Fig . 4c ) . Results using ATAC - seq closely recapitulated ChIP - seq binding data in this cell line and compared favorably to DNase - based fac - tor occupancy inference ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) , suggesting that factor occupancy data can be extracted from these ATAC - seq data , which would allow reconstruction of regulatory networks . AtAc - seq enables epigenomic analysis on clinical timescales Because ATAC - seq is rapid , information rich and compatible with small numbers of cells , we reasoned it may serve as a powerful tool to look at aspects of an individual’s epigenome on a time - scale that would make its application to the clinic feasible . We applied ATAC - seq to assay the epigenome of a healthy volunteer’s T cells obtained via standard serial blood draws . With rapid T - cell enrichment and sample handling protocols ( Online Methods ) , the total required time from blood draw to sequencing was approxi - mately 275 min ( Fig . 5a ) . We performed this procedure on three consecutive days ( Fig . 5b ) and investigated the ATAC - seq pro - file at the IL2 locus to show how regulatory information on an individual epigenome can be obtained . IL - 2 is a key cytokine that drives T - cell growth and functions in inflammatory and autoim - mune diseases 28 . Furthermore , distinct drugs 29 – 31 inhibit the activities of different TFs that bind putative IL2 enhancers in a context - dependent manner . One might wish to identify the causal TF pathway in order to rationally target inhibition without expos - ing the patient to drugs unlikely to serve the therapeutic goal of IL - 2 blockade . ATAC - seq showed that in the proband’s T cells , only nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , but not two other drug targets , engaged IL2 ( Fig . 5c ) . Thus , ATAC - seq was able to provide clinically relevant information on the regulatory state of this individual .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nAture methods | VOL . 10 NO . 12 | DECEMBER 2013 | 1217 Articles Using ATAC - seq footprints , we generated the occupancy profiles of 89 TFs in proband T cells , enabling systematic reconstruction of regulatory networks . With this personalized regulatory map , we compared the genomic distribution of the same 89 TFs between GM12878 and proband CD4 + T cells . TFs that exhibited large vari - ation in distribution between T cells and B cells were enriched for T cell – specific factors ( Fig . 5d ) . This analysis showed that NFAT was differentially regulating , whereas canonical CTCF occu - pancy was highly correlated within these two cell types ( Fig . 5d ) . Supporting this interpretation , we noted specific loci where NFAT was localized to known T cell – specific genes such as CD28 and the uncharacterized large intergenic noncoding RNA RP11 - 229C3 . 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Additionally , ATAC - seq of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and monocytes isolated by FACS from a single blood draw created a map of accessible chromatin and demonstrated that ATAC - seq is compatible with cellular enrichment using sur - face markers ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . Separately , allele - specific chromatin accessibility has been shown to be particularly relevant to our understanding of human disease 32 . As a proof of principle we also used ATAC - seq to identify candidate allele - specific open - chromatin regions within the GM12878 cell line ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . These results demonstrate the feasibility of generating detailed personalized gene regulatory networks from clinical samples , opening the door for future diagnostic applications . discussion ATAC - seq allows simultaneous interrogation of factor occupancy , nucleosome positions in regulatory sites , and chromatin accessibility genome wide by considering the position of insertion and the dis - tribution of insert lengths captured during the transposition reac - tion . Although extant methods such as DNase - seq and MNase - seq can also provide this information , they each require separate assays with large cell numbers . ATAC - seq also provides insert - size fingerprints of biologically relevant genomic regions , which sug - gests that it captures information on chromatin compaction . We expect ATAC - seq to have broad applicability , to considerably add to the genomics toolkit and to improve our understanding of gene regulation , particularly when integrated with other powerful rare - cell techniques such as FACS or laser - capture microdissection and recent advancements in RNA - seq 33 , 34 . One potentially exciting application of ATAC - seq is to gener - ate personal epigenomic profiles on a timescale compatible with clinical decision - making . We envision that when ATAC - seq is coupled with ongoing improvements to sequencing and analysis turnaround times , this technique will offer the possibility of a day - long turnaround time for a personal epigenomic map . Deeper analyses to generate global regulatory networks and other infer - ences will take additional time , and we anticipate that bioinfor - matic analyses—not the molecular biology or sequencing—will become the bottleneck of epigenomic studies in the future . As ATAC - seq is compatible with FACS , it may enable studies on care - fully sorted and rare subpopulations from primary tissues . We expect that ATAC - seq can also be applied to study select cellular subpopulations at different points during development and aging and during the progression of human diseases , including cancer , autoimmunity and neuropsychiatric disorders . methods Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 2688 nAture methods online methods ATAC - seq protocol . The ATAC - seq protocol has three major steps . 1 . Prepare nuclei . To prepare nuclei , we spun 50 , 000 cells at 500 g for 5 min , which was followed by a wash using 50 µ L of cold 1× PBS and centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min . Cells were lysed using cold lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 10 mM NaCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 1 % IGEPAL CA - 630 ) . Immediately after lysis , nuclei were spun at 500 g for 10 min using a refrigerated centrifuge . To avoid losing cells during the nuclei prep , we used a fixed - angle centrifuge and carefully pipetted away from the pellet after centrifugations . 2 . Transpose and purify . Immediately following the nuclei prep , the pellet was resuspended in the transposase reaction mix ( 25 µ L 2× TD buffer , 2 . 5 µ L transposase ( Illumina ) and 22 . 5 µ L nuclease - free water ) . The transposition reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C . Directly following transposition the sample was purified using a Qiagen MinElute kit . 3 . PCR . Following purification , we amplified library fragments using 1× NEBnext PCR master mix and 1 . 25 µ M of custom Nextera PCR primers 1 and 2 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , using the following PCR conditions : 72 °C for 5 min ; 98 °C for 30 s ; and thermocycling at 98 °C for 10 s , 63 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min . To reduce GC and size bias in our PCR , we monitored the PCR reaction using qPCR in order to stop amplification before satura - tion . To do this , we amplified the full libraries for five cycles , after which we took an aliquot of the PCR reaction and added 10 µ l of the PCR cocktail with Sybr Green at a final concentration of 0 . 6× . We ran this reaction for 20 cycles to determine the additional number of cycles needed for the remaining 45 - µ L reaction . The libraries were purified using a Qiagen PCR cleanup kit yielding a final library concentration of ~ 30 nM in 20 µ L . Libraries were amplified for a total of 10 – 12 cycles . Low – cell number protocol . To prepare the 500 - and 5 , 000 - cell reactions , we used the same protocol with some notable excep - tions : the transposition reaction was done in a 5 - µ L instead of 50 - µ L reaction . Also , we eliminated the Qiagen MinElute purification before PCR and instead took the 5 - µ L reaction imme - diately after transposition directly into the 50 - µ L PCR . Library QC and quantitation . During the ATAC - seq protocol , we chose to avoid a size - selection step to maximize the library complexity . The sequenced insert size is a distribution between 40 bp and 1 kb with a mean of ~ 120 bp . From the bioanalyzer and gels we observed fragments > 2 kb , which would make Qubit and other mass - based quantitation methods hard to interpret . For this reason we quantified our libraries using qPCR - based methods . CD4 + enrichment from peripheral blood . One green - top tube of whole blood was obtained from one normal volunteer three times over a 72 - h period , under a Stanford University IRB - approved protocol . Informed consent was obtained . 5 mL of blood at each time point was negatively selected for CD4 + cells using RosetteSep Human CD4 + T Cell Enrichment Cocktail ( StemCell Technologies ) . RosetteSep cocktail was incubated with the blood at 50 µ L / mL for 20 min , diluted in an equal volume of PBS with 2 % FBS and underlaid with 15 mL Ficol - Paque Plus ( GE ) . Blood was centrifuged for 20 min at 1 , 200 g without break , negatively selected cells were removed from the density medium – plasma interface and cells were washed twice in PBS with 2 % FBS . FACS of peripheral blood leukocytes and GM cells . GM 12878 cells were stained with DAPI NucBlue Fixed Cell Stain ( Molecular Probes ) , and live cells were sorted using a FACSAria ( BD Biosciences ) with a 100 - µ m nozzle . One peripheral blood sample ( buffy coat ) was stained with BD Bioscience antibodies CD14 - A - 488 ( M5E2 , diluted 1 : 20 ) , CD3 - PE - Cy7 ( SK7 , 1 : 20 ) , CD4 - APC - Cy7 ( RPA - T4 , 1 : 20 ) and CD8 ( RPA - T8 , 1 : 20 ) for 20 min in the dark at RT . Cells were lysed using BDpharmLyse at 1 : 10 dilution in diH 2 0 ( BD ) for 15 min , centrifuged for 5 min , washed with PBS 2 % FBS twice and resuspended in PBS with 2 % FBS . 50 , 000 CD3 + CD8 + , CD3 + CD4 + and CD14 + cell populations were sorted into PBS with 10 % FBS . Primary data processing . Data were collected using either 34 × 8 × 34 reads from a MiSeq or 50 × 8 × 50 reads on a HiSeq . Reads were aligned to hg19 using Bowtie 36 with the parameters - X2000 and - m1 . These parameters ensured that fragments up to 2 kb were allowed to align ( - X2000 ) and that only unique align - ing reads were collected ( - m1 ) . For all data files , duplicates were removed using Picard . For peak - calling and footprinting , we adjusted the read start sites to represent the center of the transposon binding event . Previous descriptions of the Tn5 transposase show that the trans - poson binds as a dimer and inserts two adaptors separated by 9 bp ( ref . 11 ) . Therefore , all reads aligning to the + strand were offset by + 4 bp , and all reads aligning to the – strand were offset −5 bp . ATAC - seq peak - calling . We used ZINBA to call all reported ATAC - seq peaks in this manuscript . ZINBA was run using a window size of 300 bp and an offset of 75 bp . Alignability was used to model the zero - inflated component , and the ATAC - seq read count for the background and enriched components . Enriched regions were identified as those with a posterior probability of > 0 . 8 . ATAC - seq insertion size enrichment analysis within chroma - tin annotations . First , the distribution of paired - end sequenc - ing fragment sizes overlapping each chromatin state ( http : / / www . ensembl . org / info / docs / funcgen / regulatory _ segmentation . html ) were computed . The distributions were then normalized to the percent maximal within each state , and enrichment was computed relative to the genome - wide set of fragment sizes . Nucleosome positioning . To generate the nucleosome - position data track , we chose to split reads into various bins . Reads below 100 bp were considered nucleosome free , reads between 180 and 247 bp were considered to be mononucleosomes , reads between 315 and 473 bp were considered to be dinucleosomes , and reads between 558 and 615 bp were considered to be trinucleosomes ( for determining cutoffs , see Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Dinucleosome reads were split into two reads , and trinucleosome reads were split into three reads . Reads were analyzed using Danpos and Dantools 22 using the parameters - p 1 , - a 1 , - d 20 , - clonalcut 0 . The background used was nucleosome - free reads ( reads less than 100 bp ) , allowing an effective negative weighting of these reads . n p g © 2013 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 2688 nAture methods This analysis allows calling multiple overlapping nucleosomes . Although generating nucleosome tracks using simple insert size cutoffs may yield false positives due to other nucleosome - sized features , i . e . , enhanceosomes , we observed that we faithfully recapitulated global features on nucleosome position genome wide ( Fig . 3c , d ) . ChIP - seq peak - calling and clustering . ChIP - seq data were down - loaded from the UCSC ENCODE repository ; for a complete list of data used , see Supplementary Table 2 . Peaks where called using GEM 37 , and the parameters used where - k _ min 6 - k _ max 20 . Inputs were used as a control for peak - calling . Binding events were annotated by distance to the nearest dyad in bins of 10 bps . Factors were then hierarchically clustered using Euclidean distance and normalized by gene and centered by mean 38 . Footprinting using CENTIPEDE . The genome - wide set of motifs was obtained from the ENCODE motif repository ( http : / / compbio . mit . edu / encode - motifs / ) . The input for Centipede ( ref . 27 ) included the PWM score , conservation ( PhyloP ) and ATAC - seq counts within ± 100 bp of each genomic region matching a motif . ChIP - seq data were obtained from the UCSC ENCODE repository . Comparison of transcription factor regulatory networks . Transcription factor regulatory networks were constructed by comparing the GENCODE v . 14 genes with the genome - wide set of posterior probabilities estimated by Centipede for the respec - tive cell types . The extent to which a transcription factor regu - lated each gene was determined by taking the sum of the weighed posterior probabilities for a given transcription factor mapping to the same chromosome . For each mapped motif , the posterior probability was weighted on the basis of the distance to the tran - scription start site for each gene . Comparison of transcription factor regulatory networks was computed as the correlation of each transcription factor in a given cell type with all transcription factors in the other cell type . The resulting correlation matrix was hierarchically clustered using the Pearson correlation coefficient and complete linkage 38 . Candidate IL2 enhancer analysis . We inspected ENCODE data on the UCSC genome browser to identify putative IL2 enhancers in one or more cell types that may be responsive to FDA - approved immunomodulatory drugs . We scanned the inter - genic region upstream of IL2 in hg19 for ( i ) enhancer - associated histone marks ( H3K4me1 and H3K27ac ) , ( ii ) binding by one or more TFs as confirmed by ChIP - seq and ( iii ) TF pathways targ - etable by a human therapeutic . This analysis identified IRF4 - and STAT3 - binding sites in addition to the known NFAT - responsive elements ( ref . 28 ) . 36 . Langmead , B . , Trapnell , C . , Pop , M . & Salzberg , S . L .
