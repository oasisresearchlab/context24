Therefore , the mechanics of blood ﬂow in microvessels controls selective distributions of blood to the tissues and largely inﬂuences material exchange in the circulatory system . In this review , we ﬁrst consider ﬂuid - mechanical characteristics of blood ﬂow in microvessels in Sec - tion 2 , and then consider material exchange across microvessel walls in Section 3 . Distinctive features of blood ﬂow and microvessel permeability are discussed mainly from mechanical aspects . Mathematical models describing their experimental evidences are illustrated , which elucidate individual roles of microvascular elements including mechanical properties of blood cells , surface properties of blood vessels , and ultrastructure of the vessel wall . Analyses based on these mathematical models help to understand the mechanism of phenomena , and then the hemodynamic and physiological function of the microcirculation . 2 . Blood ﬂow in microvessels 2 . 1 . Introduction In the ﬁrst part of this review , we consider the mechanics of blood ﬂow in microvessels and describe its characteristics obtained by in vitro and in vivo experiments , together with its current mathematical knowledge . To analyze hemodynamic functions in the complex in vivo vascular system , one must ﬁrst understand the ﬂow behavior of blood in tubes with simple geometry in vitro . Historically , accumulated in vitro data elucidated various characteristics of blood ﬂow in small tubes and most of them were well described by mathematical models . However , more recent experimental studies suggested that the ﬂow resistances in vivo are substantially higher than the corresponding values measured in vitro . Several mechanisms have been postulated to account for this discrepancy and each contribution has been examined for the past 15 years . The ﬁrst part of this paper describes this story from a ﬂuid - mechanical point of view , although causes for the discrepancy of ﬂow resistance have not been fully understood yet . We brieﬂy review rheological properties of blood in Section 2 . 2 , and then show characteristics of blood ﬂow in small tubes obtained in vitro in Section 2 . 3 and mathematical approach to them in Section 2 . 4 . Section 2 . 5 is devoted to demonstrate in vivo experimental results on the ﬂow resistance and to consider possible causes of the increased resistance to ﬂow in vivo compared to in vitro . Coverage of these topics is not comprehensive . In addition , we omit many important topics in the microcirculation , including the regulation of blood ﬂow and its variations in health and disease . We hope readers whose interest this paper may stimulate would read other excellent reviews ( Gaehtgens , 1980 ; Chien et al . , 1984 ; Zweifach and Lipowsky , 1984 ; Lipowsky , 1986 ; Cokelet , 1986 ; Goldsmith et al . , 1989 ; Skalak et al . , 1989 ; Secomb , 1991 ; Secomb and Hsu , 1995 ; Pries et al . , 1996 , Schmid - Schönbein , 1999 ; Kamm , 2002 ) . 2 . 2 . Rheological properties of blood Blood is a suspension of red blood cells , white blood cells ( leukocytes ) , and platelets in plasma . Blood plasma is an incompressible Newtonian ﬂuid with viscosity of about 1 . 2 cP at 37 ◦ C . Normal human blood has a hematocrit ( volume fraction of red cells ) of about 40 – 45 % . Thus , blood is a quite highly concentrated suspension and its rheological properties are strongly inﬂuenced by red cells . 84 M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 The human red blood cell has a biconcave discoid shape at rest with a major diameter of about 8 (cid:1) m and a thickness of 2 (cid:1) m . It has no nucleus , and consists of a thin membrane ﬁlled with a hemoglobin solution that is a Newtonian ﬂuid with viscosity of about 6 – 7 cP at normal conditions ( Cokelet and Meiselman , 1968 ) . The mechanical properties of the membrane have been well known . The membrane , consisting of a lipid bilayer and a cytoskeleton ( a network of protein molecules adjacent to and projecting through the bilayer ) , is a ﬂexible viscoelastic solid with surface viscosity of about 10 − 3 dyn s / cm ( Evans and Hochmuth , 1973 ; Chien et al . , 1978 ) . The elastic shear modulus of the membrane is about 6 × 10 − 3 dyn / cm . This value is several orders of magnitude lower than the modulus of isotropic areal dilation , which is about 5 × 10 2 dyn / cm , and so the membrane shears readily but resists area changes . The bending modulus of the membrane is about 1 . 8 × 10 − 12 dyn cm ( Evans , 1983 ) . The bending resistance is small unless very small radii of curvature are involved . The ﬂuid interior of a human red blood cell , the low resistance of its membrane to shear and bending deformations , and the presence of the excess surface area for its volume make it highly deformable , as long as changes in surface area or volume are not required . Thus , a red cell can easily pass through capillaries with diameters less than its resting diameter . The minimum diameter of a cylindrical tube that will permit a normal red cell to pass through intact is known to be as narrow as about 2 . 8 (cid:1) m ( Canham and Burton , 1968 ; Halpern and Secomb , 1989 ) . Leukocytes are generally spherical with a mean diameter of about 6 . 8 (cid:1) m , and have many ﬁne mem - brane folds on their surfaces . They are much less deformable than the red cells , and may be ﬁrst approx - imated by rigid spheres in mechanical aspects ( Skalak and Skalak , 1995 ) . The rheological properties of leukocytes have been reviewed in many articles ( e . g . Schmid - Schönbein , 1986 ; Hochmuth et al . , 1995 ) . Since leukocytes are about 1000 times less numerous than red cells in normal blood ( Schmid - Schönbein et al . , 1981 ; Schmid - Schönbein , 1990 ) , they have traditionally been neglected in many blood rheological considerations . This assumption of their insigniﬁcance may be appropriate for blood ﬂow in large vessels , but in the microcirculation , where the diameters of the blood vessels and cells are comparable , leukocytes can contribute signiﬁcantly to resistance to blood ﬂow ( Schmid - Schönbein et al . , 1981 ) , as will be shown in Section 2 . 5 . 3 . Human blood also contains platelets with round or oval discoid shapes with a maximum dimension of about 2 (cid:1) m . They are much smaller than red cells and occupy even less of the blood volume than the leukocytes . Although they play an important role in blood clotting , they are rheologically unimportant in normal blood . 2 . 3 . Characteristics of blood ﬂow in capillary tubes The rheological properties of blood ﬂowing in microvessels have been extensively studied by in vitro experiments , using a suspension of red cells ﬂowing through small tubes . There are two key parameters : the apparent viscosity and the hematocrit in small tubes . In vitro experiments indicate that the resistance to ﬂow through a small tube is smaller than the value that would be if the red cell suspension were a Newtonian ﬂuid with the viscosity obtained from bulk measurements ( Fahraeus – Lindqvist effect ) . The volume fraction of red cells in small tubes ( tube hematocrit , H T ) was found to be less than the hematocrit entering or leaving the tube ( discharge hematocrit , H D ) ( Fahraeus effect ) . In this section , we brieﬂy introduce these experimental results , starting by deﬁning the apparent viscosity . The term “tube” here is used for artiﬁcial tubes such as glass capillaries adopted in in vitro experiments or ideal tubes in numerical simulations , as distinguished from microvessels in living body . M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 85 For a steady ﬂow of a homogeneous Newtonian ﬂuid through a circular cylindrical tube , the volume ﬂow rate Q varies directly with the pressure drop (cid:2) p across the tube and the fourth power of the tube diameter D : Q = (cid:1) (cid:2) pD 4 / 128 (cid:2) L , ( 1 ) where L is the tube length and (cid:2) is the ﬂuid viscosity . The formula , which is usually called as Poiseuille’s law , can be also applied to blood ﬂow in the tube with diameters of about 500 (cid:1) m or more , with the bulk viscosity of blood as (cid:2) . The bulk viscosity of blood is approximately 4 cP at normal hematocrit for the shear rate larger than 100 s − 1 . In microvessels or narrow tubes , however , particulate nature of blood becomes important , and (cid:2) is not a known constant . Nevertheless , Eq . ( 1 ) is useful to deﬁne an apparent viscosity of blood (cid:2) a , in such a way that , if Q , (cid:2) p , D , L are all measured , then (cid:2) a = (cid:1) (cid:2) pD 4 / 128 QL . ( 2 ) The value of (cid:2) a represents the viscosity of a homogeneous Newtonian ﬂuid that would give the same ﬂow rate according to Poiseuille’s law for the same tube length , diameter , and pressure drop . The ratio of (cid:2) a / (cid:2) , where (cid:2) is the viscosity of the plasma , is referred to as the relative apparent viscosity , and is often used to represent the viscous property of blood ﬂowing through microvessels or narrow tubes . Another parameter called as the resistance to ﬂow may be useful to consider the ﬂow through a vascular bed as well as through a single vessel . The ﬂow resistance , R ∗ , is deﬁned as the ratio of the pressure drop and the volume ﬂow rate , so that it can be related to the apparent viscosity as R ∗ = (cid:2) p / Q = 128 (cid:2) a L / (cid:1) D 4 . ( 3 ) 2 . 3 . 1 . Fahraeus – Lindqvist effect Numerous in vitro experiments have been made to measure the apparent viscosity of blood in narrow glass tubes . Martini et al . ( 1930 ) as well as Fahraeus and Lindqvist ( 1931 ) were the ﬁrst to observe a signiﬁcant decrease of apparent blood viscosity in tubes with diameters less than 500 (cid:1) m . This is known as the Fahraeus – Lindqvist effect . The reduction of apparent blood viscosity with decreasing tube diameter was found to continue down to diameters of approximately 10 (cid:1) m . For even smaller diameters approaching the minimum diameter of 2 . 8 (cid:1) m , a steep increase of viscosity was observed ( Gaehtgens , 1980 ) . The increase of the blood viscosity with decreasing tube diameter in very narrow tubes is often called as the inverse Fahraeus – Lindqvist effect . Pries et al . ( 1992 ) compiled literature data on relative blood viscosity in tube ﬂow in vitro , and obtained the empirical relationship between the relative apparent viscosity and tube diameter for red cell suspensions with a hematocrit of 45 % in glass tubes ( Fig . 1 ( a ) ) : (cid:1) (cid:2) a (cid:2) (cid:2) 0 . 45 = 220e − 1 . 3 D + 3 . 2 − 2 . 44e − 0 . 06 D 0 . 645 . ( 4 ) The relative apparent viscosity depends on the hematocrit as well as the ﬂow velocity . Its variation with tube diameter D ( in (cid:1) m ) and discharge hematocrit H D for medium to high ﬂow velocities ( above 50 tube diameters / s ) are described as (cid:2) a (cid:2) = 1 + (cid:1)(cid:1) (cid:2) a (cid:2) (cid:2) 0 . 45 − 1 (cid:2) ( 1 − H D ) C − 1 ( 1 − 0 . 45 ) C − 1 , ( 5 ) 86 M .

( 6 ) The reduced apparent viscosity of blood in narrow tubes results mainly from the tendency that de - formable cells are displaced toward the tube axis so that a cell - depleted region is formed near the wall . For tubes of large diameter ( > 500 (cid:1) m ) the effect of the cell - depleted wall layer on viscosity is negligible , because its width is much smaller than the tube diameter . But for smaller tubes , the presence of the cell - depleted wall layer signiﬁcantly decreases the apparent viscosity . Typical ﬂow patterns of red cells in narrow tubes are shown in Fig . 2 . In the wall layer where the highest shear rates occur , the local viscosity M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 87 Fig . 2 .

Single - ﬁle ﬂow is always present in smaller tubes whereas transition to “zipper” or multi - ﬁle ﬂow may occur at higher hematocrit in tubes larger than approximately 7 (cid:1) m ( from Gaehtgens , 1980 ) . is close to the plasma viscosity ( ∼ 1 . 2 cP ) , which reduces the wall shear stress and so ﬂow resistance , as seen in Section 2 . 3 . 3 . 2 . 3 . 2 . Fahraeus effect The tendency of red cells to migrate away from the tube wall , creating a layer of zero or low hematocrit adjacent to the wall , results in higher mean velocity of red cells compared to the plasma , since the central core of red cells ﬂows faster than the cell - depleted wall layer . This leads to a reduction of the tube hematocrit compared to the discharge hematocrit , as follows . Here , we consider a steady ﬂow of suspension of cells through a tube from or to a reservoir ( see the left panel of Fig . 1 ) . The conservation of mass leads to the relationship : H T / H D = V / U C , ( 7 ) where H T and H D represent the volume concentration of the cells in the tube and in the reservoir , respectively , and U C and V are the mean velocity of the cells and the mean velocity of the suspension ( bulk velocity ) , respectively . Then , V < U C in narrow tubes results in H T < H D . A decrease in H T / H D with decreasing tube diameter is called as the Fahraeus effect and has been ﬁrst demonstrated by the classic work of Fahraeus ( Fahraeus , 1929 ; Barbee and Cokelet , 1971 ) . A further decrease in tube diameter below approximately 30 (cid:1) m or less was found to increase H T / H D , which is referred to as the inverse Fahraeus effect .

( 1990 ) for model simulation of blood ﬂow ( Fig . 1 ( b ) ) . We see H T / H D < 1 for the tube diameter smaller than 300 (cid:1) m . 2 . 3 . 3 . Theoretical basis for Fahraeus and Fahraeus – Lindqvist effects As previously noted , the Fahraeus – Lindqvist effect and Fahraeus effect result primarily from the pres - ence of the central core of red cells and the cell - depleted wall layer . Their qualitative explanation can be made by a most simple model for blood ﬂow , consisting of cell - rich core and cell - free wall layer in a tube , called as the “stacked - coins” or “axial - train” model ( Whitmore , 1968 ) . In this model , all red cells are assumed to lie in a cylindrical core region of diameter (cid:3) D ( 0 < (cid:3) < 1 ) on the axis of a tube of diameter D ( Fig . 3 ( a ) ) . Outside of the core there is a wall layer of plasma with viscosity (cid:2) , and the core is assumed to be another Newtonian ﬂuid with viscosity (cid:2) 0 . The continuity of the velocity and stresses at the outer edge of the core together with the no - slip condition on the tube wall leads to the velocity proﬁle of the ﬂuid in terms of the radial coordinate r as u =    (cid:4) 4 (cid:2) (cid:7)(cid:1) D 2 (cid:2) 2 − r 2 (cid:8) ( (cid:3) D / 2 (cid:1) r (cid:1) D / 2 ) , (cid:4) 4 (cid:2) 0 (cid:7)(cid:1) (cid:3) D 2 (cid:2) 2 − r 2 (cid:8) + (cid:4) 4 (cid:2) (cid:1) D 2 (cid:2) 2 ( 1 − (cid:3) 2 ) ( 0 (cid:1) r (cid:1) (cid:3) D / 2 ) , ( 9 ) M .

( 11 ) Then , the Fahraeus effect and Fahraeus – Lindqvist effects are evaluated as H T H D = V U c = 1 2 1 − (cid:3) 4 (cid:1) 1 − (cid:2) (cid:2) 0 (cid:2) 1 − (cid:3) 2 (cid:1) 1 − (cid:2) 2 (cid:2) 0 (cid:2) , (cid:2) a (cid:2) = (cid:1)(cid:4) D 4 128 (cid:2) Q = 1 1 − (cid:1) 1 − (cid:2) (cid:2) 0 (cid:2) (cid:3) 4 . ( 12a , b ) In the limit of (cid:3) approaching 0 , we have H T / H D → 1 / 2 and (cid:2) a / (cid:2) → 1 , and in the other limit of (cid:3) approaching 1 , we have H T / H D → 1 and (cid:2) a / (cid:2) → (cid:2) 0 / (cid:2) . Consider the ﬂow in a tube whose diameter is larger than ∼ 20 (cid:1) m . If the thickness of the wall layer d , that is deﬁned by d = ( D / 2 ) ( 1 − (cid:3) ) , is independent of the tube diameter , then (cid:2) a / (cid:2) increases up to (cid:2) 0 / (cid:2) with increasing diameter , and H T / H D also increases up to 1 . Then , adopting (cid:2) 0 / (cid:2) = 3 . 2 ( see Eq . ( 4 ) ) , we plot the curves of Eqs . ( 12a ) and ( 12b ) in Figs . 1 ( a ) and ( b ) , for the thickness of the wall layer d = 1 . 8 and 3 (cid:1) m . The curve of the relative apparent viscosity for d = 1 . 8 (cid:1) m in Fig . 1 ( a ) is very close to the experimental results at H D = 0 . 45 ( Secomb , 1991 ) , although the corresponding curve in Fig . 1 ( b ) does not give a good approximation . A limitation of this model is that the width of the cell - free layer is a ﬁtted parameter . In reality , it ought to be determined from the effect of the tube wall on red cells and mutual interaction between red cells . However , quantitative theories describing these interactions , taking into account the deformability and high concentration of red cells , are not currently available . In a tube of diameter D < ∼ 6 (cid:1) m , red cells are more likely to ﬂow in a single ﬁle . As shown in Fig . 2 , the red cells are typically deformed from their resting biconcave disk shape to parachute , slipper or bullet like shapes , which depend on the pressure difference across the cell , the tube diameter and hematocrit . The stresses exerted on the cells by the surrounding plasma deform the red cells into shapes that are narrower than the tube , and there exists a layer of plasma between the red cells and the tube wall . This situation may be better approximated by assuming that the central core of the stacked - coins model is a rigid body , i . e . (cid:2) 0 / (cid:2) = inﬁnity ( Fig . 3 ( b ) ) . In this case , we have H T H D = 1 + (cid:3) 2 2 , (cid:2) a (cid:2) = 1 1 − (cid:3) 4 . ( 13a , b ) As (cid:3) increases to 1 , both of H T / H D and (cid:2) a / (cid:2) increase , with H T / H D → 1 and (cid:2) a / (cid:2) → ∞ . As seen in Fig . 2 , as the tube diameter is decreased from 6 (cid:1) m , the ratio of the maximum diameter of deformed cells relative to the tube diameter generally increases , approaching 1 in the limit of the critical tube diameter ( ∼ 2 . 8 (cid:1) m ) . This implies that a decrease in tube diameter corresponds to an increase in 90 M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 (cid:3) of this model . Thus , Eqs . ( 13a ) and ( 13b ) qualitatively explain an increase in H T / H D and (cid:2) a / (cid:2) with decreasing tube diameter ( inverse Fahraeus effect and inverse Fahraeus – Lindqvist effect ) . For 2 . 8 (cid:1) m < D < 6 (cid:1) m , we calculated the values of (cid:3) that provide the same value of H T / H D as Eq . ( 8 ) at H D = 0 . 45 , or the same value of (cid:2) a / (cid:2) as Eq . ( 4 ) . From the values of (cid:3) thus obtained , we evaluated the gap width d . It is about 0 . 07 , 0 . 3 , 0 . 6 , 0 . 9 (cid:1) m at D = 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 (cid:1) m , respectively . Although these values may be useful as a ﬁrst approximation , the width of the plasma layer should be determined on the basis of the mechanics of cell deformation and plasma ﬂow . Theoretical treatments of red cell motion in narrow tubes will be considered in the next section . 2 . 4 . Mathematical models of blood cell motion in microvessels In this section , we describe some mathematical models of blood ﬂow in narrow tubes whose diameter is at most 10 (cid:1) m or so , where individual motions of blood cells in plasma are considered . A variety of models for blood cells have been proposed such as various rigid or ﬂexible particles . We here treat only red cells and show some of their representative models , to consider basic properties of cell motion through narrow tubes and to relate them to the Fahraeues – Lindqvist effect and Fahraeus effect . The Reynolds number of the blood ﬂow in microvessels is much less than unity , so that the inertial terms in the equation of motion describing the plasma ﬂow and the cell motion can be neglected . The plasma is known to be an incompressible Newtonian ﬂuid , and thus its motion is governed by the Stokes equation (cid:5) (cid:1) u (cid:1) t = −∇ p + (cid:2) ∇ 2 u ( 14 ) and the continuity equation , ∇ · u = 0 , ( 15 ) where u is the velocity vector , p is the pressure , and (cid:5) is the density and (cid:2) is the viscosity of the plasma . It is well approximated that the cells are neutrally buoyant and that there are no body forces . Then , the equations of motion for the cell require that the net force and the net moment on each blood cell be zero . In addition , the deformation of each cell must be compatible with the stresses and velocities of the plasma surrounding it . Before entering the detail of red cell models , we here introduce another rheological parameter that is useful for narrow tube ﬂow . If the tube considered is so narrow that red cells travel in a single ﬁle and effects of interactions between cells are assumed negligible , then the apparent viscosity depends linearly on the tube hematocrit H T . Thus , the relative apparent viscosity can be expressed in terms of a parameter K T as (cid:2) a (cid:2) = 1 + K T H T , ( 16 ) where K T is called as the intrinsic viscosity . Many theoretical and numerical studies have examined the values of K T , depending on the mechanical properties of cell membrane , red cell velocity and tube diameter . The assumption of neglecting the interaction between cells was shown to be valid as long as neighboring cells are separated more than one tube diameter ( Lew and Fung , 1969 ; Wang and Skalak , 1969 ; Sugihara - Seki and Skalak , 1988 ) . For shorter separation distances , the cell interaction generally decreases M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 91 the contribution of each cell to the apparent viscosity : i . e . the value of K T ( = ( (cid:2) a / (cid:2) − 1 ) / H T ) generally decreases with decreasing cell spacing in a manner depending on the geometry of cell arrangements and the tube diameter ( Sugihara - Seki and Skalak , 1988 ) . 2 . 4 . 1 . Axisymmetric ﬂows : ﬁnite element method A ﬁnite element method was applied to a single ﬁle ﬂow of red cells in narrow tubes when they are placed on the centerline of the tube with axisymmetric shapes ( Zarda et al . , 1977b ) . The membrane of a red cell was modeled as a thin shell , that is elastic in shear and in bending , but its area remains constant during any deformation . Zarda et al . ( 1977a , b ) considered a steady motion of red cells in a uniform cylindrical tube . We here brieﬂy outline their study . For axisymmetric shells , the equations of mechanical equilibrium are given by Timoshenko ( 1940 ) . The loading on the cell in this instance consists of the normal stress b , due to the difference of the pressure between the external and internal ﬂuids , and the tangential stress (cid:6) , by the viscous shear of the external ﬂuid . The equations for equilibrium of normal stress , tangential stress and bending moments in the membrane are respectively given , in the cylindrical coordinates ( r , (cid:7) , x ) moving with the cell , by K 1 T 1 + K 2 T 2 = b − cos (cid:7) r d ( qr ) d r , d d r ( T 1 r ) = T 2 + K 1 r cos (cid:7) q − r cos (cid:7) (cid:6) , q = cos (cid:7) r (cid:1) M 2 − d d r ( M 1 r ) (cid:2) . ( 17a , b , c ) Here , M 1 and M 2 are the bending moments , q is the shear force , T 1 and T 2 are membrane tensions per unit of ﬁnal length , and K 1 and K 2 are principal curvatures ( Fig . 4 ) . Subscript 1 denotes components in a plane containing the tube axis and subscript 2 denotes azimuthal components . The membrane considered is elastic so that a strain energy function exists . Then , assuming the mem - brane strain energy with respect to shear per unit of initial area as W m = E 8 ( (cid:3) 41 + (cid:3) 42 + 1 ) , ( 18 ) Skalak et al . ( 1973 ) suggested the membrane constitutive equations , T 1 = 1 (cid:3) 2 (cid:1) W m (cid:1) (cid:3) 1 + T , T 2 = 1 (cid:3) 1 (cid:1) W m (cid:1) (cid:3) 2 + T , ( 19 ) where (cid:3) 1 and (cid:3) 2 are the principal stretch ratios in the meridian and circumferential directions , respectively , and T is an isotropic membrane tension , which is the analog of pressure in an incompressible ﬂuid . The coefﬁcient E is the shear modulus of the red cell membrane . A constant area of the membrane requires (cid:3) 1 (cid:3) 2 = 1 . Similarly , the bending strain energy is assumed as W b = B 8 ( K 21 + 2 (cid:8) K 1 K 2 + K 22 ) ( 20 ) 92 M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M .

Stress resultants in an element of an axisymmetric shell . and the bending constitutive equations are M 1 = 1 (cid:3) 2 (cid:1) W b (cid:1) K 1 , M 2 = 1 (cid:3) 1 (cid:1) W b (cid:1) K 2 , ( 21 ) where (cid:8) is the Poisson’s ratio , and B is the bending modulus of the membrane . The interior of the red cell is assumed to be an incompressible Newtonian ﬂuid . But the viscous properties of the interior and the membrane play no role in the ﬁnal solution , because the shape of the red cell is constant and no ﬂow exists inside , for a steady ﬂow through a uniform tube . A ﬁnite element method was used in the numerical computation , based on a variational principle with a variational functional pertinent to the above equations . The deformation of the red cell and the ﬂow of the external ﬂuid were computed simultaneously in seeking the stationary point of the variational functional . A typical example of the numerical results is shown in Fig . 5 , which represents the converged shapes for red cells moving at constant velocities under several different pressure drops ( Zarda et al . , 1977a ) . These results are for a line of cells aligned in a periodic manner along the tube axis , with a hematocrit close to 26 % . In this case , the diameter ratio of the resting red cells relative to the tube is 0 . 95 . As the pressure drop across the cell is increased , the cell is more deformed to be longer and more convex at the front , starting from its resting concave shape . The rear of the cell is kept concave , as observed experimentally . For high - pressure drops , the rim bulges outward at the trailing edge of the cell , and the minimum gap width between the cell and the tube wall occurs at this point . It can be seen from the initial and ﬁnal node locations ( indicated by the black dots ) that the outer most rim node changes its radial position about 15 % at the highest pressure drop . The radial displacements of the other nodes are smaller than this value . Since the circumferential stretch ratio (cid:3) 2 is proportional to the radius and the azimuth stretch ratio (cid:3) 1 is (cid:3) 1 = 1 / (cid:3) 2 , the elastic part of the tensions ( the ﬁrst terms of Eq . ( 19 ) ) will be small compared to the isotropic tension T , in the present case . M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 93 26 20 10 3 1 . 2 0 Fig . 5 . Computed shapes of a red cell model ﬂowing axisymmetrically in a circular cylindrical tube . All cases shown have the same surface area and volume . The diameter ratio of the resting red cell relative to the tube is 0 . 95 . The numbers denote the dimensionless pressure drop across the cell ( redrawn based on Fig . 9 by Skalak , 1980 ) ( Zarda et al . , 1977a ) . 2 . 4 . 2 . Axisymmetric ﬂows : lubrication theory In vivo and in vitro observations indicate that the width of the gap between the red cell and the vessel wall is generally small compared to the length of the cell , for a single ﬁle ﬂow of red cell in narrow vessels , particularly if the vessel diameter is less than about 6 (cid:1) m ( see Fig . 2 ) . Thus , the analysis of plasma ﬂow in the gap may be simpliﬁed by using lubrication theory and it may be more tractable to analyze smaller tubes . In the lubrication approximation , the partial differential equations of ﬂuid motion in the lubrication region are replaced by a set of ordinary differential equations . The lubrication theory was ﬁrst applied to the analyses of red cell motion in narrow tubes by Lighthill ( 1968 ) and Barnard et al . ( 1968 ) . They adopted some different assumptions for the deformation of a red cell in the lubrication region . In subsequent studies , Secomb and his colleagues ( 1986 ) and Secomb ( 1991 ) made intensive studies based on the lubrication theory and predicted the values of apparent viscosity in narrow tubes that agree with experimental data in glass capillaries in vitro ( Eq . ( 4 ) ) . Here , we introduce the analyses using the lubrication theory . In the lubrication theory , it is assumed that radial ﬂuid velocities are small compared to axial velocities , and that the pressure in the lubrication region is independent of radial position . In cylindrical coordinates 94 M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 moving with the cell , the ﬂow is steady , and the pressure is p ( x ) , where the x - axis is taken along the tube centerline . Then , the axial velocity u ( r , x ) of plasma in the gap satisﬁes (cid:2) r (cid:1) (cid:1) r (cid:1) r (cid:1) u (cid:1) r (cid:2) = d p d x . ( 22 ) Boundary conditions are given by u = 0 on the cell r = r 0 ( x ) , and u = u 0 at the wall r = R , where − u 0 is the cell velocity , r 0 ( x ) is the radial position of the cell membrane and R is the radius of the tube . We deﬁne the “leakback” ( volume ﬂow rate of ﬂuid relative to the cell ) per unit circumference by q 0 = (cid:9) R r 0 u ( r , x ) r R d r . ( 23 ) Since the plasma is incompressible , q 0 is independent of x . Eqs . ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) may be solved for the pressure gradient in terms of r 0 ( x ) and q 0 as d p d x = g ( r 0 ) = 16 (cid:2) R 2 − r 20 (cid:7) u 0 (cid:7) R 2 2 + R 2 − r 20 4 log ( r 0 / R ) (cid:8) − Rq 0 (cid:8) (cid:10)(cid:7) R 2 + r 20 + R 2 − r 20 log ( r 0 / R ) (cid:8) . ( 24 ) The shear stress acting on the cell surface exerted by the plasma is given by (cid:6) = 1 4 g ( r 0 ) (cid:7) R 2 − r 20 r 0 log ( r 0 / R ) + 2 r 0 (cid:8) − (cid:2) u 0 r 0 log ( r 0 / R ) . ( 25 ) The equations governing the elastic response and mechanical equilibrium of the membrane , corre - sponding to Eqs . ( 17 ) – ( 21 ) , and the equations of lubrication theory , ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) , may be combined to give a system of ordinary differential equations . The solution is subject to the constraints that the surface area and volume of the cell are prescribed . Using this method , Secomb et al . ( 1986 ) examined the dependence of the cell shape on the velocity , and reported that at low velocities , the cell bulges outward , closely approaching the tube wall , while at higher velocities , the cell shape becomes more streamlined . For velocities of 0 . 1 cm / s or more , they made the above analysis without including the effects of bending resistance ( by setting B = q = 0 ) . The case of high - velocity limit was also analyzed by setting both bending resistance and shear resistance to zero where purely isotropic tension acts in the membrane . Their results of the apparent viscosity are summarized in Fig . 6 together with available experimental data . In Fig . 6 , a substantial increase in K T with decreasing velocity is apparent for diameters less than 8 (cid:1) m . The predictions are in general agreement with the experimental determinations , which were made using red cells in glass tubes and rubber model cells . Eq . ( 8 ) indicates that a typical tube hematocrit H T is 0 . 30 – 0 . 40 for tube diameter 3 . 5 – 8 (cid:1) m at H D = 0 . 45 ( see Fig . 1 ( b ) ) . Substituting this range of hematocrit into Eq . ( 16 ) , we see from Fig . 6 that K T is less than 2 . 5 for ﬂow velocities above 0 . 1 cm / s , so that the apparent viscosity of blood in small tubes is no more than twice the plasma viscosity in this condition . This represents the inverse Fahraeus – Lindqvist effect and the predicted values of the relative apparent viscosity at cell velocities = 0 . 1 cm / s are plotted in Fig . 1 ( a ) . The predictions agree fairly with the experimental data . M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M .

In Fig . 7 , K T values and hematocrit ratios H T / H D computed for different cell models are plotted as a function of cell - to - tube ﬁnal diameter ratio (cid:3) f . A cylindrical membrane model refers to the model considered in this section , without including bending resistance . For discocyte and sphere models , deformation is not considered . The closeness of the curves in Fig . 7 indicates that the inﬂuence of shape is not large if particles of the same maximum diameter are compared . The results of the stacked - coins model with rigid core are also plotted in Fig . 7 . The stacked - coins model generally underestimates K T and overestimates H T / H D , for given cell - to - tube diameter ratios compared to the other models , but provides useful information , which again suggests the importance of the gap width between the cell and the tube wall . 2 . 4 . 3 . Tank - treading motion and asymmetric ﬂows Experimental studies show that actual red cell shapes in ﬂow are not axisymmetric ( see Fig . 2 , Skalak and Branemark , 1969 ) . Observations of red cells in glass capillaries have indicated that an asymmetrically placed red cell may exhibit a continuous rotation of the membrane around the cell ( Gaehtgens , 1981 ) . 96 M .

( a ) Intrinsic viscosity and ( b ) hematocrit ratio , as a function of cell - to - tube ﬁnal diameter ratio (cid:3) f computed for various shaped axisymmetric red cell models . Data of the thin elastic shell , cylindrical membrane and discocyte models are taken from Ozkaya ( 1986 ) and Skalak et al . ( 1989 ) . This phenomenon , called as tank - treading motion , is enabled by the ﬂuid interior of the cell and its ﬂexible membrane . In microvessels or glass capillaries with diameter of 8 (cid:1) m or more , cells often travel in two rows to form a staggered , zipper - like pattern ( Gaehtgens , 1981 ) . In such arrays , each cell is offset from the centerline of the vessel , and so may undergo a tank - treading motion ( Gaehtgens and Schmid - Schönbein , 1982 ) . As seen in the preceding section , theoretical and numerical analyses based on axisymmetric red cell shapes in narrow tubes provide results compatible to in vitro measurements . Here , the question arises whether departures from axisymmetry affect the apparent viscosity signiﬁcantly . An initial study using a two - dimensional model for asymmetric , tank - treading red cell predicted a considerable reduction of the apparent viscosity compared to corresponding symmetric cells ( Secomb and Skalak , 1982 ) . However , the later analysis ( Hsu and Secomb , 1989 ) based on a three - dimensional model showed relatively small differences ( 3 – 15 % ) of apparent viscosity between asymmetric , tank - treading cells and corresponding axisymmetric cells for tube diameters from 5 to 7 (cid:1) m . We consider details of this difference below . In order to avoid difﬁculty in determining cell shape and ﬂow ﬁeld simultaneously in the three - dimensional analysis , Hsu and Secomb ( 1989 ) prescribed the cell shape and membrane motion , which is pertinent to the experimental observations and mechanical requirement that the membrane tank - treading motion is synchronous and area conserving . The motion of the cell and the tank - treading frequency were calculated using the lubrication theory . A key difference between the two - dimensional and three - dimensional studies was predicted values of the membrane velocity of the tank - treading motion . The tank - treading velocity was determined to satisfy the condition that the rate of energy input to the cell from the surrounding ﬂuid is equal to the rate of energy dissipation in the cell membrane and interior . M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 97 Fig . 8 . Flow ﬁelds inside and outside of tank - treading red cell models in a two - dimensional zipper - like arrangement . Each arrow represents the velocity of the ﬂuid relative to the axial velocity of the cells . The width of the channel is 8 . 4 (cid:1) m , the axial distance between the centers of neighboring cells is 7 (cid:1) m , and the viscosity ratio of the internal to external ﬂuids is 6 . In the three - dimensional model , the viscous dissipation associated with the three - dimensional mem - brane motion tends to inhibit tank - treading motion and the predicted membrane velocities of the tank - treading motion were much smaller than cell velocities , while in the two - dimensional model , relatively rapid tank - treading motion was predicted . This leads to difference in effects of tank - treading motion on the apparent viscosity between the two - and three - dimensional models . Experimentally observed tank - treading frequencies were higher than the predicted values of the three - dimensional model ( Gaehtgens and Schmid - Schönbein , 1982 ) . Then , a full analysis determining simultaneously the cell shape and ﬂow ﬁeld together may provide higher tank - treading frequencies compared to those by Hsu and Secomb ( 1989 ) . However , experimentally obtained tank - treading velocities are still not high enough to induce a signiﬁcant change in apparent viscosity ( Secomb , 1991 ) . In larger capillaries with diameter 8 (cid:1) m or more , or higher hematocrit , single ﬁle ﬂow of red cells is replaced by multiﬁle ﬂows of red cells . One of representative arrangements of red cells is a zipper - like pattern , as is evident in vivo and in vitro ( see Fig . 2 ) . A two - dimensional model for this zipper - like arrangement of red cells was developed by Sugihara - Seki et al . ( 1990 ) . They adopted a cell model that has a triangular shape , with a ﬂexible but inextensible membrane and a viscous ﬂuid inside . A similar but more realistic shaped model is shown in Fig . 8 , where the model cells are arranged in a spatially repeating staggered pattern . In this ﬁgure , the cells are stationary but the walls move from right to left . In the analysis , the cell shape is prescribed and the membrane of each cell is allowed to move along its circumference ( tank - treading ) with a velocity whose magnitude is determined under the condition that tangential component of ﬂuid force both inside and outside , integrated around the cell , must vanish . For a given position of the cell and its inclination relative to the wall , the cell motion ( axial and lateral velocities and angular velocity ) is determined from force - free and torque - free conditions together with the membrane velocity , and a steady equilibrium position is searched . Fig . 8 shows an example of such a stable , steady equilibrium conﬁguration of cells . The membrane adjacent to the wall moves from the front to the rear . This is the same direction as the wall , so that the membrane tank - treading motion decreases the velocity gradient of plasma in the gap region compared to 98 M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 that without the tank - treading if the cell velocity and cell conﬁguration are unchanged . In addition , the membrane adjacent to its neighboring cells moves from the rear to the front , i . e . with the same direction as its neighboring membranes . From these characteristics of the membrane motion , an increase in tank - treading velocity followed by a decrease in internal viscosity is expected to decrease the apparent viscosity . Numerical analyses showed that , as the internal viscosity of the cell was increased from zero to six times plasma viscosity ( corresponding to red cells ) , apparent viscosity for a steady conﬁguration increased , as expected . However , further increase in internal viscosity slightly decreased the apparent viscosity , which is due to shift of steady position of the cells relative to the wall ; as the internal viscosity increases the cells tend to move more apart from the wall , increasing the width of the plasma layer adjacent to the wall . When the internal viscosity is further increased above a certain critical value , a stable conﬁguration of the cells such as shown in Fig . 8 is lost . Instead , they exhibit an unsteady oscillatory motion . This transition of cell motion from stable steady motion to unsteady ﬂipping motion with increasing internal viscosity is similar to that found in unbounded simple shear ﬂow ( Keller and Skalak , 1982 ) . Thus , it was concluded that tank - treading motion tends to stabilize red cell motion in this two - ﬁle zipper - type ﬂow , but it does not greatly inﬂuence the apparent viscosity . Several attempts have been done to fully analyze asymmetric ﬂows of cells in small tubes where both of cell shape and ﬂow ﬁeld are solved simultaneously ( Coulliette and Pozrikidis , 1998 ) . In unbounded ﬂows , capsule models consisting of a liquid internal medium enclosed by a solid deformable interface have been developed ( Barthes - Biesel et al . , 2002 ; Pozrikidis , 2003 ) . 2 . 4 . 4 . Flow ﬁelds around cells and shear stress on the cell membrane The ﬂow structures inside and outside of blood cells are directly related to the apparent viscosity of blood . Fluid stresses exerted on the cells also play signiﬁcant roles in regulating their various functions . For instance , blood cells as well as the vascular endothelial cells have been widely recognized to exhibit changes in morphology , structure and functions , in response to ﬂuid stresses . In these aspects , we consider here the ﬂow ﬁeld around blood cells ﬂowing in microvessels and examine the ﬂuid stresses on the surface of blood cells . A most simple model for circulating blood cells is a rigid sphere moving freely in a circular cylindrical tube . For a sphere located on the tube centerline , the velocity ﬁeld of the suspending ﬂuid is plotted in Fig . 9 ( a ) , in the plane containing the tube centerline for the diameter ratio of the sphere to the tube equal to 0 . 8 . Each arrow shows the velocity vector relative to the axial velocity of the sphere . In this frame , the sphere is stationary and the wall of the tube moves from right to left . Far upstream and downstream from the sphere , a Poiseuille ﬂow is assumed . Solid curves showing the velocity proﬁles of the ﬂuid at the cross - sections approximately one tube diameter upstream and downstream from the sphere , indicate that the velocity proﬁles of those cross - sections are almost equal to the Poiseuille ﬂow . Since the velocity of the ﬂuid near the tube centerline is positive ( i . e . it is faster than the sphere velocity ) , but the velocity near the tube wall is negative ( i . e . it is slower than the sphere velocity ) , there are recirculating ﬂows both upstream and downstream of the sphere . In the gap regions between the sphere and the tube wall , shear ﬂow is observed . However , considerations of mass conservation through the gap region predict a convex velocity proﬁle in this frame of reference near the narrowest portion . Therefore , the pressure gradient is positive there . In fact , Fig . 9 ( b ) , which shows the distribution of the pressure along the tube wall , indicates a positive pressure gradient near x = 0 . The membrane of the cell experiences the stresses exerted by the surrounding ﬂuid . Fig . 9 ( c ) shows the distributions of the shear stress and pressure acting the surface of the sphere along a circumference in a M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M .

Reﬂecting the ﬂow ﬁeld seen in Fig . 9 ( a ) , the shear stress is positive in the gap region between the sphere and the tube wall , and it vanishes at the stagnation points at (cid:7) = 0 and (cid:1) , changing its sign twice between them . On the other hand , the pressure is generally positive at the upstream side , and negative at the downstream side . Its variation in the gap region is consistent with the pressure on the tube wall in Fig . 9 ( b ) . The distributions of stresses on the cell surface shown in Fig . 9 ( c ) are helpful to understand parachute - like deformation of red cell model considered in Sections 2 . 4 . 1 and 2 . 4 . 2 : convex and concave faces at the front and rear , respectively , and a rim bulging outward at the trailing edge . Along the deformed shape of the red cell model , the distribution of the ﬂuid stresses is shown in Fig . 10 . Due to the deformation , large variations of stresses are observed near the narrowest part in the gap region between the cell and the tube wall , although essential features of their distributions are the same as for a sphere shown in Fig . 9 ( c ) . When the spacing between neighboring cells becomes narrower , the interaction between the cells may be important . In such a case , plasma ﬂow between neighboring cells may have closed streamlines in 100 M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M .

This type of plasma ﬂow is called the bolus ﬂow ( Fig . 11 , Gaehtgens , 1980 ) . The presence of bolus ﬂow was , at ﬁrst , expected to promote the rate of oxygen transfer from red cells to vessel wall by convection . But such convective effect was found to be insigniﬁcant for the transport kinetics of rapidly diffusing substances such as the blood gases ( Aroesty and Gross , 1970 ) . M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M .

Flow ﬁeld and streamlines of the ﬂuid ﬂowing around periodic staggered arrangements of spheres , in a plane containing the centers of spheres and tube centerline . Each arrow represents the velocity of the ﬂuid relative to the axial velocity of the spheres . The spheres are freely ﬂoating at a radial position 0 . 2 of the tube radius from the tube centerline , with the diameter ratio of the sphere to the tube being 0 . 5 and the axial distance between neighboring spheres being 0 . 625 of the tube radius ( revised from Sugihara - Seki and Skalak , 1997a ) . When the red cell is placed off - center of the tube , an asymmetric distribution of the stresses on its membrane induces the tank - treading motion . The velocity ﬁeld for a zipper - like arrangement of red cells is already presented in Fig . 8 , which was computed for a two - dimensional model . As a similar example in the three - dimensional case , the ﬂow ﬁeld around staggered arrangements of spheres is shown in Fig . 12 , in a plane containing the center of the spheres and the tube centerline ( Sugihara - Seki and Skalak , 1997a ) . In the presence of the tank - treading motion of the cell membrane or the rotation of spheres , there are temporal variations of stresses exerted on every point of the cell membrane by the ﬂuid ﬂow , even when the motion of the cells is steady . The distribution of shear stresses acting on the cell membrane is plotted in Fig . 13 ( a ) , when the cell is modeled as a rigid sphere and placed off - center of the tube ( Sugihara - Seki and Schmid - Schönbein , 2003 ) . For comparison , the shear stress distribution when it is embedded in an unbounded simple ﬂow is also shown in Fig . 13 ( b ) , which represents for example a blood cell in a larger blood vessel away from its wall . In both cases , spatial and temporal variations of shear stresses are signiﬁcant on the membrane of circulating blood cells . Such a variation of stresses may be important as a mechanical stimulus to cell responses , and also may induce disorders of cell functions when it lasts for long time or with large magnitudes . 2 . 5 . Flow resistance in vivo Direct measurements of the apparent viscosity of blood in individual living microvessels have yielded apparent viscosities substantially higher than those observed in glass tubes with corresponding diameters 102 M .

( 1990 , 1994 ) compared observed distributions of ﬂow and hematocrit in microvascular networks of the rat mesentery with results of theoretical simulations , and concluded that apparent viscosities in microvessels are considerably higher than those in glass tubes . To ﬁt best to the in vivo data , they modiﬁed the curve of the apparent viscosity , Eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , obtained from in vitro experiments as (cid:1) (cid:2) a (cid:2) (cid:2) ∗ 0 . 45 = 6e − 0 . 085 D + 3 . 2 − 2 . 44e − 0 . 06 D 0 . 645 ( 26 ) and (cid:2) a (cid:2) = (cid:11) 1 + (cid:1)(cid:1) (cid:2) a (cid:2) (cid:2) ∗ 0 . 45 − 1 (cid:2) ( 1 − H D ) C − 1 ( 1 − 0 . 45 ) C − 1 (cid:1) D D − 1 . 1 (cid:2) 2 (cid:12) (cid:1) D D − 1 . 1 (cid:2) 2 ( 27 ) with C according to Eq . ( 6 ) . The in vivo law is illustrated in Fig . 14 , which clearly shows that in vivo viscosity is much higher than the corresponding in vitro viscosity ( dotted curve at H D = 0 . 45 ) , especially for the diameter smaller than 40 (cid:1) m ( Pries et al . , 1996 ) . To account for this discrepancy , several possible causes are postulated ( Pries et al . , 1990 , 1994 ) : ﬂow obstruction by leukocytes , a macromolecular lining ( glycocalyx ) on the interior of microvessels reducing the cross - section available for ﬂow , asymmetrical distribution of red cells within microvessels , additional pressure drop at bifurcations , and irregularity of microvessel lumens . The contribution of each mechanism to the higher apparent viscosity of blood in vivo has been studied from various aspects . Pries et al . ( 1996 ) has reviewed this topic before , including the effects of red cell aggregation and sedimentation as well as network architecture of microvessels . The presence of the M .

Relative apparent viscosity as a function of vessel diameter , determined by a network analysis based on in vivo data in the mesentery ( Eqs . ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) ) ( Pries et al . , 1994 , 1996 ) . For comparison , the curve shown in Fig . 1 ( a ) at H D = 0 . 45 obtained from in vitro experiments is plotted as a dotted curve . glycocalyx can largely account for this phenomenon and irregularity of vessel cross - sections may also contribute to it . In the present paper , therefore , we will discuss the effects of irregularities of the vessel lumen and the glycocalyx on the apparent viscosity of blood or ﬂow resistance in microvessels in vivo . Eqs . ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) were obtained from the observations in the rat mesentery . The effect of leukocytes on the mesentery microcirculation may be insigniﬁcant , because of the comparatively large size of mesenteric capillaries ( Pries et al . , 1994 ) . However , recent in vivo studies indicate their important role in organ blood ﬂow in skeletal muscle , where microvessels are narrower than in mesentery . Then , as a third mechanism , we will also consider the effect of leukocytes on blood ﬂow in microvessels in Section 2 . 5 . 3 . 2 . 5 . 1 . Irregularities of vessel lumen In contrast to uniform straight tubes used in typical in vitro studies , numerous anatomical studies have revealed that vessel lumens are non - circular in cross - section and non - uniform along the vessel axis ( Greensmith and Duling , 1984 ; Carlson et al . , 1982 ) . The lumen of microvessels is irregular , especially in the vicinity of endothelial cell nuclei . Cokelet and Sarelius ( 1992 ) pointed out the possibility that the assumption of circularity and uniformity of the vessel lumen could lead to signiﬁcant errors in hemodynamic relationships deduced from in vivo data . Several analyses have been made for blood ﬂow in contracting arterioles which have uniform but non - circular cross - sections , and showed that the vascular resistance of such vessels is constantly higher than that for tubes of the same area with circular cross - section ( Schmid - Schönbein and Murakami , 1985 ) . Theoretical estimates of the vascular resistance for non - uniform but circular cross - sections demonstrated that axial variations in vessel diameter could elevate vascular resistance in individual vessels , compared to uniform circular tubes with an average diameter ( Sugihara - Seki et al . , 1989 ) . 104 M .

Computational results of the ﬂow resistance for a model shown in Fig . 15 at (cid:9) ∗ = (cid:1) / 2 , relative to that for a uniform circular cylindrical tube with the same diameter ( Sugihara - Seki , 1995 ) . The inﬂuence of protrusions of endothelial cell nuclei into the vessel lumen has been examined by a numerical computation ( Sugihara - Seki , 1995 ) . Nuclei of endothelial cells are assumed to protrude regularly into the vessel lumen with a sinusoidal shape in both circumferential and longitudinal directions ( Fig . 15 ) , and the ﬂow resistance relative to that for a uniform circular cylindrical tube with the same diameter was evaluated ( Fig . 16 ) . With nuclear protrusions of 2 . 25 (cid:1) m high corresponding to in vivo observations ( Carlson et al . , 1982 ) , the relative resistance is predicted to increase about 10 % for 20 (cid:1) m microvessels and up to 40 % for 10 (cid:1) m microvessels , when the spacing between neighboring protrusions is approximately the vessel diameter . In the analyses hereto referred in this section , blood is assumed to be a uniform Newtonian ﬂuid . For smaller vessels where red cells ﬂow in a single ﬁle , Secomb and Hsu ( 1997 ) considered the effect of transient deformations experienced by red cells traversing nonuniform tubes . They included a mem - brane shear viscosity into the elastic model shown in Section 2 . 4 . 2 , and membrane viscoelasticity was represented by a Kelvin solid model , total membrane shear stress being the sum of viscous and elastic contributions . Their axisymmetric analysis showed that , when a red cell encounters a region of capil - lary narrowing , additional energy is dissipated , due to membrane viscosity and due to narrowing of the M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 105 lubrication layer , that increases the ﬂow resistance . The increase in resistance is much larger when blood cells are present than in the absence of blood cells . Predicted resistance to cell motion in a vessel with periodic constrictions ( diameter varying between 5 and 4 (cid:1) m ) is roughly twice that in a uniform vessel with diameter 4 . 5 (cid:1) m . The increase in resistance predicted here , while substantial , is not sufﬁcient to account for levels of ﬂow resistance observed in vivo compared to in vitro , which imply an approximately fourfold increase in resistance in vessels with diameter of 10 (cid:1) m and even larger increases at smaller diameters ( Secomb and Hsu , 1997 ) . 2 . 5 . 2 . Effects of glycocalyx It has long been known that the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium is lined with a glycocalyx , a layer of membrane bound macromolecules and adsorbed plasma proteins . Such a layer , the glycocalyx or the endothelial surface layer , is capable to impede plasma ﬂow . Thus , the presence of the glycocalyx decreases the effective cross - sectional area of the vessel available for plasma and red cell motion , so that it would possibly cause an increase in ﬂow resistance . The increase in ﬂow resistance would be negligible if the glycocalyx is thin compared to the vessel diameter . Conversely , if it is thick , the resistance increase would be signiﬁcant . The thickness of the glycocalyx has been debated and its experimental estimates have generated much controversy ( see Pries et al . , 2000 ; Weinbaum et al . , 2003 for references ) . Electron - microscopic studies have typically revealed a layer several tens of nanometers thick , much thinner than microvessel diameters . On the other hand , in vivo measurements of the width of the columns of red cells and labeled Dextran 70 in capillaries in the hamster cremaster muscle indicated the existence of a layer with a thickness of about 0 . 4 – 0 . 5 (cid:1) m adjacent to the endothelium ( Vink and Duling , 1996 ) , which can exclude red cells and some macromolecules . The summary of various experimental estimates of glycocalyx thickness was provided by Pries et al . ( 2000 ) . More recent observations indicated that it is 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 (cid:1) m thick in the frog mesentery ( Squire et al . , 2001 ) , and 0 . 2 – 0 . 5 (cid:1) m thick in the rat myocardial capillary ( Van den Berg et al . , 2003 ) . In the next , we will show by a simple analysis that the presence of a glycocalyx with 0 . 5 (cid:1) m thick would have a profound effect on the ﬂow resistance in microvessels . However , we note here that an impermeable layer of 1 . 5 (cid:1) m thick is necessary if the difference of ﬂow resistance between in vivo and in vitro is accounted for solely by the presence of a glycocalyx ( Pries et al . , 1997 ) . 2 . 5 . 2 . 1 . Brinkman medium model The effect of the presence of the glycocalyx on the ﬂow resistance in a microvessel can be understood easily by using a simple mathematical model . In the current model , we consider a circular cylindrical tube of radius R with a glycocalyx of constant thickness h lining on the interior surface of the tube wall . Assuming the glycocalyx as a porous material , Damiano et al . ( 1996 ) ﬁrst used the Brinkman equation to represent the ﬂow through the glycocalyx : (cid:5) (cid:1) u (cid:1) t = −∇ p + (cid:2) ∇ 2 u − K u , ( 28 ) where u and p are the velocity vector and the pressure of plasma , respectively , and (cid:5) and (cid:2) are the density and viscosity coefﬁcient . The last term on the right - hand side of Eq . ( 28 ) represents frictional force which obeys Darcy’s law , and K is the hydraulic resistivity . It is noteworthy that the Brinkman equation has a length scale of (cid:10) = √ (cid:2) / K , which represents a typical thickness of velocity varying layer . 106 M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 We consider a steady axisymmetric ﬂow through a tube driven by a pressure drop along the tube axis . Outside the glycocalyx , one has a classical unidirectional viscous ﬂow of an incompressible Newtonian ﬂuid with viscosity (cid:2) . Then , the equations of motion for the ﬂuid are expressed in cylindrical coordinates as − d p d x + (cid:2) r d d r (cid:1) r d u d r (cid:2) − Ku = 0 ( R − h (cid:1) r (cid:1) R ) , − d p d x + (cid:2) r d d r (cid:1) r d u d r (cid:2) = 0 ( r (cid:1) R − h ) , ( 29 ) where u represents the axial ( x - ) component of the ﬂuid velocity . Under the no - slip boundary condition at r = R , the solution of these equations together with a continuity equation is easily obtained as u ( r ) =    (cid:4) K ( AI 0 ( r / (cid:10) ) + BK 0 ( r / (cid:10) ) + 1 ) ( R − h (cid:1) r (cid:1) R ) , (cid:4) 4 (cid:2) ( − r 2 + C ) ( r (cid:1) R − h ) , ( 30 ) where (cid:4) is the pressure gradient , and I 0 and K 0 represent modiﬁed Bessel functions , and A = − ( ( R − h ) / 2 (cid:10) ) K 0 ( R / (cid:10) ) + K 1 ( ( R − h ) / (cid:10) ) I 0 ( R / (cid:10) ) K 1 ( ( R − h ) / (cid:10) ) + K 0 ( R / (cid:10) ) I 1 ( ( R − h ) / (cid:10) ) , B = ( ( R − h ) / 2 (cid:10) ) I 0 ( R / (cid:10) ) − I 1 ( ( R − h ) / (cid:10) ) I 0 ( R / (cid:10) ) K 1 ( ( R − h ) / (cid:10) ) + K 0 ( R / (cid:10) ) I 1 ( ( R − h ) / (cid:10) ) , C = ( R − h ) 2 + 4 (cid:10) 2 ( AI 0 ( ( R − h ) / (cid:10) ) + BK 0 ( ( R − h ) / (cid:10) ) + 1 ) . ( 31 ) Fig . 17 shows the velocity proﬁles of Eq . ( 30 ) for (cid:10) = 0 . 02 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , and 0 . 2 (cid:1) m , when the pressure gradient (cid:4) is kept constant at h = 0 . 5 (cid:1) m and R = 3 (cid:1) m . In this ﬁgure , the velocity is normalized by the centerline velocity of a Poiseuille ﬂow ( at K = 0 ) . The corresponding resistance to ﬂow relative to the Poiseuille ﬂow is 2 . 01 , 1 . 91 , 1 . 75 , and 1 . 48 for (cid:10) = 0 . 02 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 (cid:1) m , respectively . No direct measurements of the mechanical properties of the glycocalyx have been reported . However , observations of its functional behavior and theoretical considerations have given the estimate that the value of K for endothelium glycocalyx is at least 10 11 N s / m 4 ( Pries et al . , 2000 ) and 10 14 N s / m 4 ( Weinbaum et al . , 2003 ) , leading to (cid:10) ∼ 0 . 01 – 0 . 1 (cid:1) m . The thickness (cid:10) represents a typical distance that a ﬂow driven by an imposed velocity at the edge of the glycocalyx penetrates within the layer . The estimated value of (cid:10) for the glycocalyx is so small that the velocity of the ﬂuid at the outer edge of the glycocalyx u ( R − h ) is small ; it is only 7 . 8 % and 4 . 4 % of the centerline velocity for vessels of 6 and 10 (cid:1) m diameter , respectively , when (cid:10) = 0 . 1 (cid:1) m and h = 0 . 5 (cid:1) m . The typical velocity (cid:4) / K of the ﬂuid in the glycocalyx is much smaller ; it is less than 0 . 6 % and 0 . 2 % of the centerline velocity , corresponding to the above parameters . As (cid:10) decreases from 0 . 1 to 0 . 01 (cid:1) m , these velocities also decrease , implying that the ﬂuid is almost stationary in the glycocalyx layer . Then , the presence of the glycocalyx is nearly equivalent for the ﬂow resistance to narrowing the vessel radius from R to R − h , so that the relative ﬂow resistance becomes nearly equal to R 4 / ( R − h ) 4 ; it increases up to 2 for vessels of about 6 (cid:1) m diameter and 3 for 4 (cid:1) m diameter vessels , when h = 0 . 5 (cid:1) m . 2 . 5 . 2 . 2 . Effect of red blood cells For narrow vessels where red cells ﬂow in a single ﬁle , the effect of the presence of red cells can be treated theoretically in a fashion similar to Section 2 . 4 . 2 , with the cell M .

The solid curve represents the velocity proﬁle of Poiseuille ﬂow with the same pressure gradient . deformation included ( Secomb et al . , 1998 ) . The plasma ﬂow through the glycocalyx is governed by the Brinkman equation . A key assumption for the interaction between the glycocalyx and red cells is that , when the red cell penetrates the glycocalyx , the glycocalyx exerts a pressure on the red cell membrane resulting from the colloid osmotic forces generated by plasma proteins adsorbed to the glycocalyx . Secomb et al . ( 1998 ) estimated this colloidal osmotic pressure f = 200 dyn / cm 2 , and added this normal stress to the right - hand side of Eq . ( 17a ) . Their analysis indicated that a uniform layer of glycocalyx with width 1 (cid:1) m and resistivity 10 11 N s / m 4 leads to an increased ﬂow resistance , which is consistent with in vivo experimental observations in rat mesentery ( Eq . ( 26 ) , Fig . 14 ) . For example , the relative apparent viscosity of 6 (cid:1) m capillary is estimated to be ∼ 10 when H D = 45 % and the ﬂow velocity = 1 mm / s . Instead of colloidal osmotic pressure , Feng and Weinbaum ( 2000 ) proposed ﬂuid dynamics lubrication forces generated within the glycocalyx that act on the red cells . These forces become far greater than predicted by classical lubrication theory , and make red cells to “pop out” of the layer and to glide above the glycocalyx , akin to snowboarding on fresh snow powder . In their subsequent paper , Secomb et al . ( 2001 ) lowered the colloidal osmotic pressure to f = 20 dyn / cm 2 , which is comparable to a typical wall shear stress in microvessels . Their analysis showed that , if the glycocalyx is 0 . 7 (cid:1) m thick with hydraulic resistivity 2 × 10 11 N s / m 4 , then predicted variation with ﬂow velocity of the gap width between red cell and capillary wall agrees well with observations . Predicted ﬂow resistance was increased markedly at low velocities . At the cell velocity = 1 cm / s corre - sponding to the in vivo experiments shown in Fig . 14 , their ﬁgure ( Fig . 4 of Secomb et al . , 2001 ) indicates that predicted ﬂow resistance nearly accounts for the increased resistance in vivo , for the vessels of 6 (cid:1) m diameter . The combined effect of vessel irregularities and the glycocalyx has been considered recently by the same authors ( Secomb et al . , 2002 ) , and it was concluded that , with a glycocalyx layer , the increase in ﬂow resistance resulting from nonuniformity is less than twofold versus three - to fourfold without the glycocalyx in vessel geometries with the same glycocalyx - free luminal region . 108 M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 Experimentally , infusion of enzymes targeted at side chains of the glycocalyx into microvascular networks of the rat mesentery resulted in a sustained decrease in ﬂow resistance by 14 – 21 % in ﬂow pathways downstream of the infusion point ( Pries et al . , 1997 ) . This extent of resistance reduction may be smaller than expected if the above theoretical estimate of the glycocalyx contribution to the ﬂow resistance is applied . They mentioned that their experimental results may be underestimated inasmuch as the glycocalyx may have been only partially removed by the treatment . At present , intensive studies on the endothelial glycocalyx as a hydrodynamic exclusion layer have been continued . In addition , its other important roles such as a transport barrier , a mechanotransducer of ﬂuid shear stresses , an interface modulating interaction of molecules or cells , and so on have been recognized , and several new models have been proposed ( Damiano and Stace , 2002 ; Weinbaum et al . , 2003 ) . Its role as a molecular ﬁlter for the microvessel permeability will be reviewed in Section 3 . 5 . 2 . 5 . 3 . Effects of leukocytes Leukocytes are usually removed from blood samples used in most tube ﬂow studies in vitro . Since they constitute only less than 1 % of the total volume to blood cells in normal human blood , they were considered to exert little inﬂuence on the bulk rheological properties of blood . However , experimental studies indicated that leukocyte - endothelium adhesion and the subsequent obstruction of the microvessel lumen may raise intravascular resistance to blood ﬂow in microvessels , especially at low ﬂow states ( Schmid - Schönbein et al . , 1975 ; Zweifach and Lipowsky , 1984 ; Lipowsky , 1995 ; Skalak and Skalak , 1995 ) . Recent in vivo evidence suggested that leukocytes , in spite of their relatively small numbers , may have a disproportionate effect on organ blood ﬂow . At physiological hematocrit and leukocyte counts , the elevation of organ resistance in skeletal muscle in the presence of passive leukocytes is about 20 % . After activation of the same number of cells , this value may rise to more than 50 % ( Sutton and Schmid - Schönbein , 1992 , 1995 ) . Several mechanisms have been proposed whereby circulating leukocytes affect microvascular hemodynamics : ( i ) leukocyte deformation in capillaries ; ( ii ) leukocyte entrapment at the entrance to or within capillaries ; ( iii ) leukocyte margination and / or adherence in post - capillary venules ( Eppihimer and Lipowsky , 1996 ; Harris and Skalak , 1993 ; Worthen et al . , 1989 ) , and ( iv ) formation of red cell train upstream of a leukocyte in capillaries ( Thompson et al . , 1989 ; Helmke et al . , 1998 ) . With regard to ( i ) and ( ii ) , it is apparent from relatively large size and low deformability of leukocytes , that larger pressure drops are necessary across a cell for a leukocyte to traverse a capillary or enter it , compared to that for a red cell . However , modeling studies found that these may play a minimal role in increasing the resistance to ﬂow to the total ﬂow through the microvascular network ( Fentonm et al . , 1985 ; Warnke and Skalak , 1990 ) . The increase in network resistance is estimated to be about 1 – 2 % under normal physiologic conditions in skeletal muscle , and activation of leukocytes may result in 15 – 20 % increase ( Harris and Skalak , 1993 ; Warnke and Skalak , 1992 ) . In the following paragraphs , we consider the effects of ( iii ) and ( iv ) noted above , although a complete theoretical explanation of the resistance increase has not been found yet . 2 . 5 . 3 . 1 . Leukocyte endothelium adhesion Leukocyte function in immune response requires their ad - hesion to the endothelial cell lining of the blood vessel , extravasation between endothelial cells , and movement into the tissue . As circulating leukocytes exit the capillaries , ﬂuid forces give rise to an out - ward radial migration of leukocytes toward the endothelium of the small post - capillary venules , and they M .

Although there are a lot of ongoing studies to elucidate the details of these processes from molecular level as well as cellular level , we here focus on the effect of leukocyte adhesion on the ﬂow resistance from a ﬂuid - mechanical aspect . In vitro simulations using plexiglass tubes have suggested that fourfold increase in single - vessel resis - tance may occur when as few as four leukocytes marginate around the perimeter of small blood vessels . In vivo observations showed that the number of adhering leukocytes on venules of cat mesentery in - creases with decreasing wall shear rate , up to approximately 12 per 100 (cid:1) m at low ﬂow rates ( House and Lipowsky , 1987 ) . This increase in adherent leukocyte number induced an increase in ﬂow resistance by 81 % . A later in vivo study indicated that reduction in wall shear below 500 s − 1 allowed 5 – 16 adherent leukocytes per 100 (cid:1) m length in venules of 25 – 35 (cid:1) m diameter ( Perry and Granger , 1991 ) . Numerical studies have been done to evaluate the effects of leukocyte - endothelium adhesion on the blood ﬂow in microvessels , by modeling leukocytes as a rigid ellipsoidal or spherical particle ( Sugihara - Seki and Skalak , 1997b ; Chapman and Cokelet , 1998 ; Sugihara - Seki , 2000 , 2001 ) . For sim - plicity , the adherent leukocytes were assumed to be placed regularly in the ﬂow direction with equal spacings , in one row or two rows ( Fig . 19 ) , and the ﬂow around the adherent particles were computed by a ﬁnite element method . Predicted increase in ﬂow resistance is plotted in Fig . 20 , together with in vivo data by House and Lipowsky ( 1987 ) . The predicted values are consistent with in vivo measurements and demonstrate that the changes in ﬂow resistance are more pronounced in venules with smaller diam - 110 M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M .

Especially , Fig . 20 ( d ) suggests that , as the vessel diameter decreases below 25 (cid:1) m , the rate of the resistance rise per adherent leukocyte number increases steeply . For example , in postcapillary venules of about 10 (cid:1) m diameter where initial leukocyte attachment to the vessel wall may occur , the presence of one adherent leukocyte per 100 (cid:1) m length will produce an approximately threefold rise in the resistance to ﬂow . Correspondingly , two and three adherent leukocytes per 100 (cid:1) m length will produce more than ﬁvefold and sevenfold rises in the ﬂow resistance , respectively . These studies indicated that the effect of leukocyte adhesion on ﬂow resistance in venules is strongly dependent on the number of adherent leukocytes and the vessel diameter . The extent of this effect is considerable in the low - ﬂow state , and the presence of activated leukocytes may have a signiﬁcantly detrimental effect compared to normal leukocytes . 2 . 5 . 3 . 2 . Red cell train formation Due to their relatively large size and low cellular deformability , leuko - cytes in capillaries travel with a lower velocity than red cells . Consequently , leukocytes may alter the velocity and detailed motion of red cells in capillaries ( Braide et al . , 1984 , 1986 ; Schmid - Schönbein et al . , 1980 ; Thompson et al . , 1989 ) , thereby affecting the organ hemodynamic resistance ( Helmke et al . , 1997 ) .

Model conﬁguration for the formation of red cell train upstream of a leukocyte in capillaries . The skeletal muscle microcirculation of rat was perfused with different cell suspensions with and without leukocytes or red cells ( Helmke et al . , 1997 ) . Perfusion of the muscle with a pure red cell suspension with 39 % hematocrit induced a signiﬁcant increase in perfusion pressure compared to that during perfusion with the cell - free suspension . Addition of leukocytes to the red cell suspension led to a large additional pressure drop at each ﬂow rate . However , the pressure – ﬂow relationship during perfusion with the isolated leukocyte suspension was only slightly shifted compared to the cell - free suspension . These results suggest that the increase in the ﬂow resistance in skeletal muscle microcirculation in the presence of leukocytes is due to an interaction between leukocytes and red cells , and depends less on the resistance imposed by the leukocytes per se . To account for this measurement , a mechanism was proposed whereby leukocytes serve to elevate ﬂow resistance in the capillary network ( Helmke et al . , 1998 ; Thompson et al . , 1989 ) . The mechanism is as follows . Since leukocytes move at a lower velocity in capillaries than red cells , due to the difference in size and deformability , red cells ﬂowing behind a leukocyte in a capillary cannot pass it and accumulate upstream of the leukocyte to form a train of red cells . In the train , accumulated red cells are displaced from their preferred axial position into an eccentric off - axis position , so that they ﬂow at the same velocity of the slowly moving leukocyte . At this off - axis position they serve to elevate the ﬂow resistance , since the ﬂow resistance is minimum when red cells are ﬂowing on the vessel axis , and it increases for more off - axis positions . A numerical computation simulating this phenomenon has been performed with a train of red cells in off - axis positions following a single larger leukocyte in axisymmetric positions ( Fig . 21 ) . The pressure drop across the leukocyte and the red cell train was evaluated by summation of that for a single large sphere ( leukocyte ) and that for a two - row arrangement of small spheres ( red cells ) , under the condition that the velocities of the leukocyte and red cells are equal . The computation for a leukocyte followed by a train of about 200 red cells showed approximately 30 % increase in ﬂow resistance ( Helmke et al . , 1998 ) . This estimate agreed with the magnitude of the effect exerted by leukocytes in an in vivo skeletal muscle preparation ( Helmke et al . , 1997 ) . The proposed mechanism occurs whether a vasodilator is present or not . In addition , this mechanism does not require attachment of leukocytes to the endothelium . Thus , leukocytes inﬂuence the whole organ resistance in skeletal muscle to a signiﬁcant degree only in the presence of red cells . 3 .

The ultrastructural pathways and mechanisms whereby endothelial cells and the cleft between the cells modulate microvessel permeability to water and solutes have been a classical question in microvessel transport since the early 1950s . To bridge the gap between the ultra - structural data from serial section electron microscopy study about the cleft between endothelial cells ( structure ) and in vivo measurement of microvessel permeability to water and solutes ( function ) , a se - ries of mathematical models have been developed since 1950s . These models show that permeabilities to water and hydrophilic ( water - loving ) solutes in microvessels of different tissues can be accounted for by interendothelial cleft pathways with a surface ﬁber layer and junction strands with discontin - uous leakages ( Fig . 22 ) . The surface glycocalyx ( ﬁber matrix ) layer at the luminal entrance of the cleft serves as a molecular ﬁlter and is crucial for microvessel walls to maintain low permeability to macromolecules . We illustrate the transport pathways for water and solutes across microvessel walls in Section 3 . 2 , introduce the deﬁnition of microvessel permeability in Section 3 . 3 , summarize the one - and three - dimensional mathematical models for the interendothelial cleft in Section 3 . 4 , describe a particular role of endothelial surface glycocalyx in Section 3 . 5 and brieﬂy review the transport in the tissue space surrounding the microvessel in Section 3 . 6 . 3 . 2 . Transvascular pathways The endothelial cells lining microvessel walls provide the rate - limiting barrier to extravasation of plasma components of all sizes from electrolytes to proteins . So far , there are four primary pathways observed in the microvessel wall by using electron microscopy : intercellular clefts , transcellular pores , vesicles and fenestrae ( Fig . 23 ) . Microvessels of different types and in different tissues may have different primary transvascular pathways as well as under different physiological and pathological conditions ( Renkin , 1988 ) . M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 113 Fig . 23 . Schematic of various transvascular pathways in the microvessel wall ( Fu , 2001 ) . 3 . 2 . 1 . Interendothelial ( intercellular ) cleft The cleft between adjacent endothelial cells is widely believed to be the principal pathway for water and hydrophilic solute transport through the microvessel wall under normal physiological conditions . The interendothelial cleft is also suggested to be the pathway for the transport of high molecular weight plasma proteins , leukocytes and tumor cells across microvessel walls in disease . Direct and indirect evidence ( summarized in Fu et al . , 1994 ; Weinbaum et al . , 1992 ) indicates that there are tight junction strands with discontinuous leakages and ﬁber matrix components ( glycocalyx layer ) at the endothelial surface and within the cleft . These structural components of the microvessel wall form the barrier between the blood stream and body tissues , which maintains the normal microvessel permeability to water and solutes . Changes in permeability are caused by the changes in the structural components . Serial section electron microscopy study on frog mesenteric capillaries byAdamson and Michel ( 1993 ) demonstrated that the junction strand were interrupted by infrequent breaks that , on average , were 150 nm long , spaced 2 – 4 (cid:1) m apart along the strand , and accounted for up to 10 % of the length of the strand under control conditions . At these breaks , the space between adjacent endothelial cells ( average 20 nm ) was as wide as that in regions of the cleft between adjacent cells with no strands . A ∼ 2 nm translucent narrow slit along the outer leaﬂets in the tight junction was also revealed in the investigation of strand structure on a tilting stage . Using cationized ferritin , Adamson and Clough ( 1992 ) suggested that the surface glycocalyx layer is approximately 0 . 1 (cid:1) m thick in frog mesenteric capillaries . Adamson ( 1990 ) also reported that hydraulic conductivity ( L p in Eq . ( 33 ) ) increased 2 . 5 - fold after enzymatic degradation of this layer using a general protease ( pronase E ) . Applying a combined junction – oriﬁce – ﬁber entrance layer model , Fu et al . ( 1994 ) predicted that a ﬁber of 0 . 6 nm radius and a spacing of 7 nm between adjacent ﬁbers would provide an excellent ﬁt for permeability data obtained from frog mesenteric capillaries for water and solutes of size ranging from potassium ( 0 . 2 nm radius ) to albumin ( 3 . 5 nm radius ) . 3 . 2 . 2 . Vesicles Cytoplasmic vesicular exchange , which behaves like a shuttle bus , is the major pathway for transport of plasma proteins and large molecules under normal physiological conditions ( Renkin , 1988 ) . 3 . 2 . 3 . Fenestrae Fenestrae usually exist in fenestrated microvessel , such as in renal capillaries , instead of continuous microvessel endothelium . Fenestrated endothelia have higher hydraulic conductivities and are more per - meable to small ions and molecules than continuous endothelia . However , their permeabilities to plasma proteins are about the same ( Renkin , 1988 ) . 114 M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 3 . 2 . 4 . Transcellular pores In response to local tissue injury or inﬂammation , additional transport pathways for large molecules may be opened ( transcellular pores ) and existing pathways made less restrictive . The response is complex , and varies among different animals , organs , and tissues ( Michel and Neal , 1997 ) . 3 . 3 . Deﬁnitions of microvessel permeability to water and solutes Aforementioned ultrastructural study using electron microscopy and other permeability studies show that the microvessel wall behaves as a passive membrane for water and hydrophilic solute transport ( Crone and Levitt , 1984 ; Michel , 1984 ) . The membrane transport properties are often described by Kedem – Katchalsky equations derived from the theory of irreversible thermodynamics , J s = P R g T (cid:2) C + ( 1 − (cid:11) f ) CJ v , ( 32 ) J v = L p ( (cid:2) p − (cid:11) d R g T (cid:2) C ) , ( 33 ) where J s and J v are the solute and total volumetric ﬂuxes per unit area ; (cid:2) C and (cid:2) p are the concentration and pressure difference across the membrane . L p , the hydraulic conductivity , describes the membrane permeability to water . P , the diffusive permeability , describes the permeability to solutes . (cid:11) f is the solvent drag or ultraﬁltration coefﬁcient which describes the retardation of solutes due to membrane restriction , and (cid:11) d , the reﬂection coefﬁcient , describes the selectivity of membrane to solutes . For transendothelial transport , (cid:11) f is equal to (cid:11) d ( Curry , 1983 ) and thus we often use (cid:11) , the reﬂection coefﬁcient , to represent both of them . R g is the universal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature . 3 . 4 . Transport models for the interendothelial cleft 3 . 4 . 1 . One - dimensional models Prior to the late 1980s , there were two major one - dimensional theories : the pore – slit and the ﬁber matrix theory ( Fig . 24 ) , which attempted to correlate cleft structure with the large amount of experimental data for L p , P and (cid:11) . In microvessels with continuous endothelium , the principal pathway for water and solutes lies between the endothelial cells through the interendothelial cleft . The one - dimensional pore – slit models were developed in terms of the ultrastructure of the cleft . 3 . 4 . 1 . 1 . Pore – slit model In pore – slit theory , the permeability properties of the microvessel wall can be described in terms of ﬂow through water - ﬁlled cylindrical pores or rectangular slits through the vessel wall . The characteristic Reynolds number for the ﬂow is in the order of 10 − 8 . A Poiseuille - type viscous ﬂow was assumed in the pore / slit to describe the resistance to water ﬂow . The resistance to solute diffusion was described in terms of the additional drag on a spherical molecule moving within the pore relative to movement in free solution , and the selectivity of the membrane in terms of steric exclusion at the pore entrance ( Curry , 1983 ; Michel , 1992 ; Taylor and Granger , 1984 ; Wissig , 1979 ) . One - dimensional model for hydraulic conductivity L p and solute permeability P is , for a cylindrical pore , L p = N (cid:1) R 4 8 (cid:2) L , P = N (cid:1) R 2 D pore (cid:9) L , ( 34 ) M .

( 35 ) Here N is the number of pores per unit surface area of the microvessel wall . R is the pore radius . L jt is the total length of the cleft per unit vessel wall surface area , f is the fraction of the slit which is open . L is the thickness of the vessel wall or the depth of the cleft measured from the lumen to the tissue . (cid:2) is the water viscosity at experimental temperatures . D pore and D slit are the restricted solute diffusion coefﬁcients within the pore or slit . (cid:9) is the solute partition coefﬁcient at the pore / slit entrance . For a cylindrical pore of radius R ( Michel and Curry , 1999 ; Weinbaum et al . , 1992 ) , we have D pore D free = 1 − 2 . 10444 (cid:4) + 2 . 08877 (cid:4) 3 − 0 . 094813 (cid:4) 5 − 1 . 372 (cid:4) 6 , ( 36 ) (cid:9) pore = ( 1 − (cid:4) ) 2 , (cid:4) = a R . ( 37 ) For a long slit of width W ( Michel and Curry , 1999 ; Weinbaum et al . , 1992 ) , we have D slit D free = 1 − 1 . 004 (cid:12) + 0 . 418 (cid:12) 3 + 0 . 210 (cid:12) 4 − 0 . 1696 (cid:12) 5 , (cid:9) slit = 1 − (cid:12) , (cid:12) = 2 a W . ( 38 ) Here a is the solute radius and D free is the solute diffusion coefﬁcient in free solution . 116 M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 The osmotic reﬂection coefﬁcient of a membrane (cid:11) is a measure of the selectivity of the membrane to a particular solute that depends only on the pore size , not the number of pores or the membrane thickness . (cid:11) is given by ( Curry , 1983 ) (cid:11) = ( 1 − (cid:9) ) 2 . ( 39 ) When there are several pathways in parallel , the membrane reﬂection coefﬁcient is the sum of the indi - vidual coefﬁcients weighted by the fractional contribution of each pathway to the membrane hydraulic conductivity ( Michel and Curry , 1999 ) . Whereas , when there are several membranes in series , for example , two in series , the overall reﬂection coefﬁcient (cid:11) T is given by ( Kedem and Katchalsky , 1963 ) (cid:11) T = P T P ( 1 ) (cid:11) ( 1 ) + P T P ( 2 ) (cid:11) ( 2 ) , P T = P ( 1 ) P ( 2 ) P ( 1 ) + P ( 2 ) , ( 40 ) where P ( 1 ) and P ( 2 ) are solute permeabilities of membranes 1 and 2 , and (cid:11) ( 1 ) and (cid:11) ( 2 ) are corresponding reﬂection coefﬁcients . 3 . 4 . 1 . 2 . Fiber matrix model The principal hypothesis to describe the molecular ﬁlter of the transvascular pathway is the ﬁber matrix theory . On the luminal side of the cleft the presence of a glycocalyx layer on the endothelial cell surface was ﬁrst described based on staining experiments using ruthelium red and Alcian blue for cell surface glycoprotein ( Luft , 1966 ) . These experiments suggested that the layer extended into outer regions of the intercellular clefts . Electron micrographs of microvessels perfused with solutions containing native ferritin suggested that , while the luminal contents had been adequately ﬁxed , the ferritin concentration was greatly reduced close to the luminal surface of the endothelial cells . Quantitative evidence that ferritin was excluded from the endothelial surface was reported in Clough and Michel ( 1988 ) and Loudon et al . ( 1979 ) , and strengthened the idea that the glycocalyx could act as a barrier to the macromolecule diffusion . More accurate estimates of the possible thickness of the endothelial cell glycocalyx were provided by Adamson and Clough ( 1992 ) in frog mesenteric capillaries . Using cationized ferritin , they visualized the outer surface of the glycocalyx that was up to 100 nm from the endothelial cell surface when the vessel was perfused with plasma . Combining intravital brightﬁeld and ﬂuorescence microscopy for the capillary glycocalyx , Duling and co - workers ( Henry and Duling , 1999 ; Vink and Duling 1996 , 2000 ) have revealed that the in vivo thickness of the glycocalyx is ∼ 400 . 500 nm in capillaries of the hamster cremaster muscle . These observations were consistent with the hypothesis that plasma proteins were absorbed to the endothelial cell glycocalyx and form part of the structure comprising the molecular ﬁlter at the cell surface ( Curry , 1985 ; Michel , 1984 , 1992 ; Schneeberger and Hamelin , 1984 , Schneeberger et al . , 1990 ) . Adamson and Clough ( 1992 ) also demonstrated that enzymatic removal of the glycocalyx , using pronase , increased the hydraulic conductivity of frog mesenteric capillaries by 2 . 5 - fold . Although the nature of ﬁbers associated with the endothelial cell surface and the cleft entrance is not well understood , the side chains of glycosaminoglycans that are likely to form part of the cell glycocalyx have a characteristic molecular radius close to 0 . 6 nm . Absorption of plasma protein like albumin into the side chains of glycosaminoglycans ( GAG ) would form a ﬁber matrix with uniform gap spacing of roughly the diameter of albumin ( ∼ 7 nm ) between adjacent ﬁbers . Regularly arranged electron densities M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 117 have been demonstrated in this region by Schulze and Firth ( 1992 ) , and these could represent ﬁbers of a molecular ﬁlter . Recent studies ( Desjardins and Duling , 1990 ; Henry and Duling , 1999 ) suggested that the surface glycocalyx is mainly composed of heparan sulfate proteoglycan , chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan , and hyaluronic acid . These mucopolysaccharide structures are highly hydrated in an electrolytic solution and are rich in proteoglycan , glycoproteins , and glycosaminoglycans aggregates , which contain large numbers of solid - bound ﬁxed negative charges . The charge effect of the glycocalyx will be discussed in a later section . Using the stochastic theory of Ogston et al . ( 1973 ) , Curry and Michel ( 1980 ) described the solute partition coefﬁcient (cid:9) and the restricted solute diffusion coefﬁcient D ﬁber in terms of the fraction of the matrix volume occupied by ﬁber S f and the ﬁber radius r f . For a random ﬁber arrangement , they are expressed as (cid:9) = exp (cid:11) − ( 1 − (cid:13) ) (cid:7) 2 a r f + a 2 r 2f (cid:8)(cid:12) , D ﬁber D free = exp (cid:13) − ( 1 − (cid:13) ) 0 . 5 (cid:1) 1 + a r f (cid:2)(cid:14) , ( 41 ) whereas , for an ordered ﬁber arrangement , as (cid:9) = 1 − S f (cid:1) 1 + a r f (cid:2) 2 , D ﬁber D free = 1 − (cid:13) ( 1 − (cid:13) ) 0 . 5 (cid:1) 1 + 2 a (cid:1) 0 . 5 r f (cid:2)(cid:14) , ( 42 ) where a is the solute radius and (cid:13) = 1 − S f is void volume of the ﬁber matrix . Based on the solution for the ﬂow around parallel square array of inﬁnite cylindrical ﬁbers using hydrodynamic theory , Tsay and Weinbaum ( 1991 ) and Weinbaum et al . ( 1992 ) found the expressions for (cid:9) and D ﬁber for a conﬁned periodic ﬁber array in a rectangular slit as (cid:9) = 1 − b 1 S f ( 1 + a / r f ) 2 1 + b 1 S f ( 1 + a / r f ) 2 , D ﬁber D free = D slit D free (cid:11) 1 + a K 0 . 5 p + a 2 3 K p (cid:12) − 1 . ( 43 ) Here D slit is the restricted solute diffusion coefﬁcient in a slit , b 1 is the coefﬁcient of the leading term in a doubly periodic Wierstrasse expansion series used in Tsay and Weinbaum ( 1991 ) , and K p here is the Darcy hydraulic conductance for an unbounded ﬁber array . For a two - dimensional square ﬁber array , K p is given by ( Tsay and Weinbaum , 1991 ) K p = 0 . 0572 a 2 (cid:1) (cid:14) a (cid:2) 2 . 377 , ( 44 ) 118 M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 where (cid:14) = r f [ ( (cid:1) / S f ) 0 . 5 − 2 ] is the gap spacing between ﬁbers ( Fig . 25 ) . For a two - dimensional random array , a Carman - Kozeny approximation for K p is ( Weinbaum et al . , 1992 ) K p = ( 1 − S f ) 3 S 2f (cid:1) a 2 4 C (cid:2) , ( 45 ) where C is a ﬁber density correction factor . When the ﬁbers are circular cylinders perpendicular to the ﬂow , Happel ( 1959 ) obtained the approximation for C as C = 2 ( 1 − S f ) 3 S f (cid:11) ln (cid:1) 1 S f (cid:2) − ( 1 − S 2f ) ( 1 + S 2f ) (cid:12) − 1 . ( 46 ) When the ﬁber is conﬁned in a slit of width W , the effective Darcy permeability K eff is related to the value of unbounded K p by the relation ( Fu et al . , 1994 ; Weinbaum et al . , 1992 ) , K eff = K p (cid:11) 1 − tanh [ ( W / 2 ) / (cid:15) K p ] ( W / 2 ) / (cid:15) K p (cid:12) . ( 47 ) For a ﬁber matrix with partition coefﬁcient (cid:9) , the reﬂection coefﬁcient (cid:11) is the same as in pore – slit model ( Curry , 1983 ) , i . e . (cid:11) = ( 1 − (cid:9) ) 2 . ( 48 ) Recent work by Feng et al . ( 1998 ) and Sugihara - Seki ( 2003 ) have made more accurate estimations for the effective diffusion coefﬁcient and reﬂection coefﬁcient by employing an effective Brinkman medium . The hydraulic conductivity L p and solute permeability P of a ﬁbrous membrane are written as ( Michel and Curry , 1999 ) L p = A ﬁber L K p (cid:2) , P = A ﬁber L D ﬁber D free (cid:9) . ( 49 ) Here A ﬁber is the area of ﬁber ﬁlled pathway . Other parameters are the same as in previous sections . However , for a conﬁned ﬁber array in a rectangular slit of width W , K p in the expression for L p should be replaced by K eff shown earlier and (cid:2) is replaced by an effective (cid:2) eff ( Fu et al . , 1994 ; Weinbaum et al . , 1992 ) as (cid:2) eff = (cid:2) [ ( W / 2 ) / (cid:15) K p ] 3 3 (cid:16) ( W / 2 ) / (cid:15) K p − tanh [ ( W / 2 ) / (cid:15) K p ] (cid:17) . ( 50 ) Although the one - dimensional pore – slit and ﬁber matrix theories described above are unable to suc - cessfully explain the large body of experimental data for L p , P and (cid:11) , they provide a useful starting point to evaluate the possible cellular and molecular structures that actually determine the permeability properties of the microvessel walls . Results from the ﬁber matrix theory are also applied in recent three - dimensional models . M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M .

Three - dimensional models Previous one - dimensional models are based on the random section electron microscopy until 1984 . Bungaard ( 1984 ) was the ﬁrst to attempt to reconstruct the three - dimensional junction strand ultrastructure 120 M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 using serial section electron microscopy . In his study , rat heart capillaries were analyzed using conven - tional 40 – 60 nm thin and 12 nm ultra thin serial section electron microscopy . Large pores of 10 – 20 nm width and 20 – 80 nm length and small pores of 4 – 5 nm width and 5 – 30 nm length were observed . He sketched the latter pores as short discontinuities in the junction strands . In contrast to Bundgaard’s study , Ward et al . ( 1988 ) examined the three - dimensional features of the junction strands of rat cardiac cap - illaries by using a goniometric tilting technique . After considering the tilting effects , they claimed that more than 70 % of the random thin sections of the junction strands were actually open and concluded that the pathway for water , and small and intermediate - sized solutes were not formed by the interruption in continuous lines of membrane fusion but by continuous junctional regions with an approximate opening of 5 nm width . Based on the study of Bungaard ( 1984 ) and Ward et al . ( 1988 ) , Tsay and Weinbaum ( 1991 ) and Weinbaum et al . ( 1992 ) proposed a basic three - dimensional model for the interendothelial cleft . In their model , junctional pores were of three types : ( a ) a frequent circular pore of 5 . 5 nm radius , ( b ) a restricted rectangular slit of 44 – 88 nm length and 8 nm width , and ( c ) a large infrequent pore of 44 – 88 nm length and 22 nm width , which is the same gap width of the wide part of the cleft . The principal predictions of this model are : ( a ) infrequent larger breaks are most likely required to account for the measured L p and P to small and intermediate - sized solutes of radius from 0 . 5 to 2 . 0 nm , ( b ) these large breaks must be accompanied by a sieving matrix only partially occupying the depth of the cleft at the luminal surface , ( c ) neither junctional pore , restricted slit or ﬁber matrix models can by themselves satisfy the permeability and selectivity data , and ( d ) one - dimensional models are a poor description of a cleft with infrequent large breaks since the solute will be conﬁned to small wake - like regions on the downstream side of the junction strand discontinuities and thus not ﬁll the wide part of the cleft . The prediction in Weinbaum et al . ( 1992 ) as to the likely geometry of the large pores in the junction strand was conﬁrmed by the serial section electron microscopic study on frog mesenteric capillaries in Adamson et al . ( 1994 ) . These serial reconstructions revealed rather long breaks of typically 150 nm width and the same gap width as the wide part of the cleft . The spacing between adjacent breaks is from 2140 to 4450 nm with an average of 2460 nm . A continuous narrow slit of roughly 2 nm width , which runs along the junctional strand , was also suggested based on goniometric tilting of their sections . The about 2 nm continuous slit was suggested by Michel and Curry ( 1999 ) to be formed by the separation of the outer membrane leaﬂet due to the snug interlock loops of occludin molecules provided that these loops from adjacent cells remain entirely extracellular . The 64 kDa transmembrane protein , occludin , was identiﬁed to be associated with the tight junction strands ( Furuse et al . , 1993 ) . Evidence of surface glycocalyx at the luminal surface of the microvessel wall was also provided by several studies described in previous sections ( Adamson , 1990 ; Adamson and Clough , 1992 ; Luft , 1966 ; Vink and Duling , 1996 ) . According to these new experimental results , a modiﬁed combined junction – oriﬁce – ﬁber entrance layer model , which included a large oriﬁce - like junctional break , a ﬁnite region of ﬁber matrix components at the entrance of the cleft and very small pores or slits in the continuous part of the junction strand , was developed by Fu et al . ( 1994 ) . Fig . 25 ( a ) shows their three - dimensional model for the interendothelial cleft . This combined junction – oriﬁce – ﬁber entrance layer model predicted that for measured hydraulic conductivity to be achieved the ﬁber layer must be conﬁned to a relatively narrow region at the en - trance to the cleft where it serves as the primary molecular ﬁlter provided that the ﬁber matrix forms an ordered array . This model also provided an excellent ﬁt for the hydraulic conductivity and the diffusive M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 121 permeability data for solutes of size ranging from potassium to albumin for frog mesenteric capillaries provided that the junction strand contains at least two types of pores , infrequent large 150 × 20 nm large oriﬁce breaks and a continuous about 2 nm narrow slit or closely spaced 1 . 5 nm radius circular pores . Due to the similarity in morphological wall structure of microvessels in different tissues ( Michel and Curry , 1999 ) , this three - dimensional model can be easily adapted to explain the permeability data in other types of microvessels . Fu et al . ( 1995 ) in another work described a new approach to explore junction strand structure . Instead of observing the junctional strand structure directly , it was attempted to construct a detailed picture of the junctional strand as a transport barrier from a combined 3 - D theoretical and experimental analysis of the diffusive wake formed by the spreading of low molecular weight tracers ( such as lanthanum and sodium ﬂuorescein ) on the downstream side of the junction strand discontinuities . An important additional evidence in support of the small pore system proposed in Fu et al . ( 1994 ) was obtained from the time - dependent studies of the penetration of lanthanum in the cleft on the abluminal side of the junction strand , confocal microscopic measurements of the spread of sodium ﬂuorescein in the tissue surrounding a perfused microvessel and a theoretical model which describes the time - dependent labeling behavior observed in these experiments . The time - dependent diffusion wake model in Fu et al . ( 1995 ) provided a new interpretation of labeled tracer studies to deﬁne the permeability pathways for low molecular weight tracers , which depend on the time - dependent ﬁlling of the extravascular space . Another experimental difﬁculty is that the existence of ﬁber matrix components cannot be directly visualized in the wide part of the cleft , especially in in vivo experiments . For this reason , it has not been clear whether the junctional barrier or the ﬁber matrix is the primary structure in determining the selectivity of the capillary wall . In Fu et al . ( 1997 ) , a time - dependent convective – diffusion wake model for high molecular weight tracers was proposed to design experiments that can test for the location of the molecular ﬁlter . Horseradish peroxidase ( Stokes radius = 3 nm ) was the test solute in their model . For this size of molecule , most of the tracer concentration difference between the lumen and the tissue was developed across the matrix layer . This observation may explain the common ﬁnding in electron microscopy that no large tracer is found in the cleft . The result indicates that failure to ﬁnd tracer in the cleft does not necessarily mean that the tracer does not cross the cleft pathway , but that , under the experimental conditions of most tracer experiments , the tracer concentration downstream from the matrix is too low to be detected ( Fu et al . , 1997 ) . 3 . 5 . Role of surface glycocalyx 3 . 5 . 1 . Molecular ﬁlter The material compositions for endothelial surface glycocalyx have been described in Section 3 . 4 . 1 . The model in Fig . 25 ( Fu et al . , 1995 ) provides a quantitative description of ﬂows through a real endothelial barrier ( frog mesenteric capillary ) in terms of directly measured geometry of the junctional strand and reasonable estimates of glycocalyx structure . The primary effect of the ﬁber matrix at the cleft entrance is to modify the two - dimensional spread of water and solutes through the cleft . In the absence of matrix ( L f = 0 in Fig . 25 ) , the pressure and albumin concentration fall symmetrically about a break in the junctional strand located halfway between the lumen and the tissue ( not shown here ) . However , in the presence of the matrix , Fig . 26 shows that more than 90 % of the drop occurs across the surface ﬁber matrix layer when the thickness L f = 150 nm . 122 M . Sugihara - Seki , B .

Effect of ﬁber matrix on ( a ) pressure drop and ( b ) concentration drop from the luminal to abluminal side of an intercellular cleft centered on a discontinuity in junction strand . x = − L f is the luminal surface , L f = 150nm is the ﬁber layer thickness . x = 0 is the cleft entrance and x = 400nm is the cleft exit ( see Fig . 25 ) . y is distance along strand ( redrawn based on Fig . 4 by Hu and Weinbaum , 1999 ) . In contrast to the resistance of the matrix to water and large solutes such as albumin ( radius = 3 . 6 nm ) , the matrix acting as the macromolecular ﬁlter offers little resistance to small solutes of less than 1 nm radius ( Fu et al . , 1994 ) . 3 . 5 . 2 . Building of starling force across the capillary wall Nearly every contemporary physiology text has explained Starling’s hypothesis in terms of a classic Landis – Starling diagram in which there is net ﬁltration in the capillaries on the arterial side and a nearly equal reabsorption on the venous side due to osmotic forces leaving a small net positive ﬁltration that accounts for the lymph ﬂow . This widely accepted view was ﬁrst seriously challenged in the provocative review by Levick ( 1991 ) . Levick shows that if one uses the latest measurements of the local average interstitial oncotic pressure in calculating the isogravimetric pressure opposing ﬁltration , one ﬁnds that in nearly every tissue except the renal capillaries and the gut mucosa the pressure in the postcapillary venules signiﬁcantly exceeds the isogravimetric pressure and there should be net ﬁltration rather than reabsorption . This fundamental paradox was the focus of a recent review by Michel ( 1997 ) summarizing our latest understanding of microvascular ﬂuid exchange . Based on arguments presented in Michel ( 1997 ) , Hu and Weinbaum ( 1999 ) have proposed a new hypothesis which suggests that the oncotic force occurs primarily across the protein sieving layer at the endothelial surface , the surface glycocalyx . In contrast , the ﬁltration pressure drop occurs across both this protein sieving layer and the interendothelial cleft with its junction strands . This model showed that the paradox described by Levick ( 1991 ) can be resolved if the oncotic force across the surface matrix layer is determined by the local difference in protein concentration between the plasma and the ﬂuid on the tissue side of the matrix layer rather than the interstitial ﬂuid in the tissue itself . The results of Hu and Weinbaum ( 1999 ) show that coupling of water ﬂow to albumin ﬂux on the tissue side of the matrix could give rise to a nonuniform distribution of albumin concentration and a corresponding nonuniform distribution of effective osmotic pressure . The interaction of these osmotic forces with the hydraulic pressure difference across the matrix and the junctional strands distal to the matrix requires further investigation . M .

( 1988 ) showed that for similar size solutes , ribonuclease and (cid:4) - lactalbumin , the permeability of ribonuclease ( P ribonuclease ) with positive charge was twice of that of (cid:4) - lactalbumin ( P (cid:4) - lactalbumin ) with negative charge in frog mesenteric capillaries . Their experiments suggested that the transvascular pathways contain negative charges . Experiments by Curry et al . ( 1989 ) and Huxley et al . ( 1993 ) suggested that orosomucoid and plasma increase net negative charge of microvessel walls to further increase P ribonuclease and decrease P (cid:4) - lactalbumin . Previously , a simple Donnan - type model was proposed to describe the charge effect on microvessel permeability ( Adamson et al . , 1988 ; Curry et al . , 1989 ; Huxley et al . , 1993 ) . It was based on a Donnan equilibrium distribution of ions , which exists as a result of retention of negative charges on the capillary membrane . It was suggested ( Deen et al . , 1980 ; Friedman , 1986 ) that the steric and electrostatic exclusions be described in terms of an effective partition coefﬁcient ( (cid:15) eff ) , (cid:15) eff = (cid:15) steric exp ( − Z (cid:2) EF / R g T ) = (cid:15) steric exp ( − Z (cid:2) (cid:16) ) . ( 51 ) Here (cid:15) steric is the steric partition coefﬁcient describing the size selectivity of the membrane , (cid:2) E is the effective Donnan - electrical - potential difference across the membrane , Z is the charge on the solute , R g is the universal gas constant , F is the Faraday constant and T is the temperature . R g T / F is 25 . 2 mV at 20 ◦ C . (cid:2) (cid:16) = (cid:2) EF / R g T is the dimensionless electrical potential difference . To investigate this charge selectivity on microvessel permeability , Fu et al . ( 2003 ) extended the three - dimensional junction – oriﬁce – ﬁber matrix model developed by Fu et al . ( 1994 ) for the interendothe - lial cleft to include a negatively charged glycocalyx layer at the entrance of the interendothelial cleft ( Fig . 27 ) . Both electrostatic and steric exclusions on charged solutes are considered at the interfaces of the glycocalyx layer between the vessel lumen and between the endothelial cleft . The effect of electro - static interactions between charged solutes and the matrix on solute transport is also described within the glycocalyx layer . Their results showed that to account for the twofold difference in P ribonuclease and P (cid:4) - lactalbumin observed in Adamson et al . ( 1988 ) , the negative charge density in the glycocalyx layer would be ∼ 25 mEq / L . Increase in the charge density from ∼ 25 to ∼ 50 mEq / L would explain the change in P ribonuclease and P (cid:4) - lactalbumin by orosomucoid ( Curry et al . , 1989 ) . Change in P (cid:4) - lactalbumin by plasma observed in Huxley et al . ( 1993 ) could be accounted for if the density increases from ∼ 25 to ∼ 60 mEq / L . An electrochemical theory of the glycocalyx surface layer on capillary endothelial cells has re - cently been developed in Stace and Damiano ( 2001 ) to study the electrochemical dynamics of an - ionic molecular transport within capillaries . Combining a constitutive relationship for electrochemi - cal transport , derived from Fick’s and Ohm’s laws , with the conservation of mass and Gauss’s law from electrostatics , a system of three nonlinear , coupled , second - order , partial , integro - differential equa - tions is obtained for the concentrations of the diffusing anionic molecules and the cations and anions in the blood . These models incorporating charge effects of the endothelial surface glycocalyx can provide a more detailed quantitative analysis of various experimental results expected to be associated with negative charge in transvascular pathways . This will also help understand the physical mechanisms of glycocalyx selectivity and provide a new method for controlling transport rates of charged solutes in drug delivery . 124 M .

E (cid:15) ( x ) , E ( x ) ( x = − L f , 0 ) are corre - sponding electrical potentials at the interfaces ( Fu et al . , 2003 ) . 3 . 6 . Transport in tissue space ( interstitium ) The relationship between the structural components of the microvessel wall and its permeability co - efﬁcients to solutes of different sizes has been systematically studied in single perfused microvessels ( Adamson et al . , 1988 ; Curry , 1979 ; Curry et al . , 1983 ; Fu et al . , 1994 , 1995 , 1997 , 1998 ; Huxley et al . , 1993 ) . However , much less use has been made of single perfused capillaries to investigate , systematically , the relationship between the composition and physical – chemical properties of the interstitium and the in - terstitial solute diffusion coefﬁcients for probes with a range of molecular sizes . Fu et al . ( 1999 ) extended a method recently developed in Adamson et al . ( 1994 ) to measure both solute capillary permeability coefﬁcients and solute tissue diffusion coefﬁcients from the rate of tissue solute accumulation and the radial concentration gradients measured around individually perfused microvessels in frog mesentery . The unique feature of the experimental design was the use of a confocal microscope to scan the tissue and the microvessel lumen to measure the local concentration of test solute within a series of tissue slices that formed the entire depth of the mesentery . This approach overcomes many limitations of previous attempts to study local capillary and tissue transport because the relative solute concentration within small volume elements in the tissue is directly measured , allowing the solute concentration proﬁles at every depth within the tissue to be analyzed . Thus the concentration difference of the test solute across the microvessel wall is directly measured . Further the method enables comparison of tissue diffusion M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 125 coefﬁcients calculated using the detailed tissue concentration proﬁles with those based on average tissue concentrations estimated from the two - dimensional projection of the concentration gradients around mi - crovessels as recorded when a video camera focused on the tissue is used to investigate the spread of dye ( Aukland and Reed , 1993 ; Berk et al . , 1997 ; Chary and Jain , 1989 ; Fox et al . , 1980 ) . The measurements for small and intermediate - sized solute movement in the interstitium of frog mesen - tery present some interesting features . At 20 ◦ C , the free diffusion coefﬁcient of small solute sodium ﬂuorescein ( D sodium ﬂuorescein free ) is 5 . 40 × 10 − 6 cm 2 / s ( Fu et al . , 1995 ) and the free diffusion coefﬁcient of intermediate - sized solute FITC - (cid:4) - lactalbumin ( D FITC - (cid:4) - lactalbumin free ) is 1 . 07 × 10 − 6 cm 2 / s ( Fu et al . , 1998 ) . In Fu et al . ( 1999 ) , the corresponding effective interstitial diffusion coefﬁcients were D sodium ﬂuorescein t = 30 % D sodium ﬂuorescein free ( Adamson et al . , 1994 ; Fu et al . , 1995 ) . D FTTC - (cid:4) - lactalbumin t = 27 % D FTTC - (cid:4) - lactalbumin free . The ratio of D sodium ﬂuorescein t to D FTTC - (cid:4) - lactalbumin t , 5 . 6 , is about 1 / 4 of the ratio of the corrected capil - lary wall permeability P sodium ﬂuorescein to P FITC - (cid:4) - lactalbumin in paired measurements reported in Fu et al . ( 1998 ) . This result indicates that the structural components in the interendothelial cleft of the microvessel wall are more selective than those in the mesenteric interstitium . Once an (cid:4) - lactalbumin molecule crosses the microvessel wall , it can diffuse through the interstitial encountering structures which reduce its free diffusion coefﬁcient to the same extent as for a solute as small as sodium ﬂuorescein . The structural components of the interendothelial cleft are plasma membranes composing the cleft wall , the surface glycocalyx of endothelial cells and the tight junction strands inside the cleft . The structural elements of the interstitium are collagens , elastins , polysaccharides ( e . g . , hyaluronate , glycosaminoglycans ) , plasma proteins extravasated from the microvessel ( Aukland and Reed , 1993 ; Levick , 1987 , 1991 ) . Fu et al . ’s results conform to the hypothesis that , under the conditions of their experiments , the space between the ﬁbers in the endothelial cell glycocalyx forms the primary size selective structure to solutes up to the size of (cid:4) - lactalbumin between the lumen and the tissue . In other words , the glycocalyx has smaller inter - ﬁber distances and is likely to be more highly organized than ﬁbers in the interstitium . Why does the interstitial transport not strongly depend on the molecular weight while the permeability of the microvessel wall to small ions and serum albumin can be different by three orders of magnitude in frog mesentery ? While this question is far from being answered , one possible explanation is that the microvessel wall must maintain large differences in plasma protein osmotic pressure and these large differences can only be established by a barrier which is highly selective between small solutes and large solutes . 4 . Summary This paper has reviewed the mechanics of blood ﬂow in microvessels and microvessel permeability . In the ﬁrst part of this paper we have described rheological properties of microvascular blood ﬂow obtained by in vivo and in vitro experiments . Some mathematical models for red cell motion in narrow tubes are presented and possible causes for the discrepancy of ﬂow resistance in vivo and in vitro are examined . Although we have mainly considered the blood ﬂow in individual microvessels , their ﬂow behaviors are required to integrate in networks of microvessels . We need to consider ﬂow separations at branchings , mutual interaction of blood cells and their interaction with vascular endothelial cells , in order to understand the hemodynamics of the microcirculation . In the second part , we have considered the material exchange across microvessel walls . Although transport across endothelium is a classical problem that has been investigated for more than 50 years , the fundamental question related to structure – function of microvessel walls and properties of cells forming 126 M . Sugihara - Seki , B . M . Fu / Fluid Dynamics Research 37 ( 2005 ) 82 – 132 the wall still remains unclear . With the help from mathematical models for more accurate interpretations and predictions , new techniques involving ﬂuorescence , atomic force and electron microscopy and new developments in molecular biology and biochemistry will lead to more fascinating discoveries in this ﬁeld . The blood ﬂow in the microcirculation is exquisitely regulated to match the changing metabolic needs of tissues , by local adjustments through the intrinsic activity of arteriolar smooth muscle cells as well as by central controls such as nervous origin . At present , the regulation of blood ﬂow in the microcirculation has been intensively studied from various aspects , including cellular and molecular levels . Recent progresses in technology have enabled to visualize molecular events occurred in living cells . Incorporating these ﬁndings , there are many unexplored problems in the microcirculation which mechanical approach is necessary to address .
