Although recent studies have begun to 15 elucidate that enhancers can dictate whether , when , and at what rate a promoter will engage in 16 transcription , the complexity of endogenous enhancers calls for theoretical models with too many 17 free parameters to quantitatively dissect these regulatory strategies . To overcome this limitation , 18 we established a minimal synthetic enhancer system in embryos of the fruit ﬂy Drosophila 19 melanogaster . Here , a gradient of the Dorsal activator is read by a single Dorsal binding site . By 20 quantifying transcriptional activity using live imaging , our experiments revealed that this single 21 Dorsal binding site is capable of regulating whether promoters engage in transcription in a Dorsal 22 concentration - speciﬁc manner . By modulating binding - site aﬃnity , we determined that a gene’s 23 decision to engage in transcription and its transcriptional onset time can be explained by a simple 24 theoretical model where the promoter has to traverse multiple kinetic barriers before transcription 25 can ensue . The experimental platform developed here pushes the boundaries of live - imaging in 26 studying gene regulation in the early embryo by enabling the quantiﬁcation of the transcriptional 27 activity driven by a single transcription factor binding site , and making it possible to build more 28 complex enhancers from the ground up in the context of a dialogue between theory and 29 experiment . 30 31 1 Introduction 32 The adoption of distinct cellular identities in multicellular organisms relies on the formation of 33 spatial gene expression domains driven , in large part , by transcriptional regulatory programs . The 34 positional information giving rise to these mRNA patterns is typically provided by transcription 35 factor gradients ( Fig . 1A ) whose concentrations are interpreted by enhancer DNA sequences that , 36 in turn , regulate transcription of developmental genes ( Wolpert , 1969 ; Briscoe and Small , 2015 ) . A 37 long - standing goal in quantitative developmental biology is to precisely predict gene expression 38 from knowledge of the DNA regulatory sequence and morphogen concentration ( Garcia et al . , 39 1 of 41 2020 ; Vincent et al . , 2016 ) . Achieving this predictive understanding requires theoretical models 40 that calculate how DNA sequence dictates the functional relation between input morphogen con - 41 centration and output transcriptional activity , and calls for testing these predictions by measuring 42 input - output functions ( Garcia et al . , 2020 ) . Precise genetic manipulations ( Venken and Bellen , 43 2005 ; Bier et al . , 2018 ) and powerful imaging technologies ( Gregor et al . , 2005 ; Garcia et al . , 2013 ; 44 Mir et al . , 2017 ) have rendered the early embryo of the fruit ﬂy Drosophila melanogaster ( Drosophila ) 45 a prime model system for quantitatively dissecting these input - output functions in development . 46 In recent years , several studies have reported that Drosophila enhancers can control various , 47 potentially independent aspects of transcriptional dynamics in early embryonic development ( Fig . 1 ; 48 Lucas et al . ( 2013 ) ; Garcia et al . ( 2013 ) ; Fukaya et al . ( 2016a ) ; Lammers et al . ( 2020 ) ; Fuqua et al . 49 ( 2020 ) ; Eck et al . ( 2020 ) ; Berrocal et al . ( 2020 ) ; Fukaya ( 2021 ) ; Harden et al . ( 2021 ) ) . First , for a 50 given gene , a fraction of loci remain transcriptionally inactive throughout entire mitotic cycles in 51 development , even when exposed to the same activator concentration as active loci ( Fig . 1B ) —a 52 behavior usually quantiﬁed through the fraction of active nuclei or loci . This stochastic decision for 53 a locus to become active is a ubiquitous and potentially important regulatory feature for shaping 54 gene - expression patterns in the embryo ( Garcia et al . , 2013 ; Dufourt et al . , 2018 ; Lammers et al . , 55 2020 ; Harden et al . , 2021 ) . However , it remains unclear whether this feature constitutes a regulatory 56 ‘knob’ or whether inactive loci are artifacts of experimental detection thresholds . Second , the timing 57 of transcription onset ( and cessation , which is not addressed in the present investigation ) can 58 also be controlled by input transcription - factor dynamics ( Fig . 1C ; Desponds et al . ( 2016 ) ; Tran 59 et al . ( 2018 ) ; Dufourt et al . ( 2018 ) ; Eck et al . ( 2020 ) ; Lammers et al . ( 2020 ) ; Desponds et al . ( 2020 ) ; 60 Harden et al . ( 2021 ) ) . Finally , the rate of transcriptional initiation in active loci is under regulatory 61 control ( Fig . 1D ) and has been the focus of most studies to date ( e . g . , Garcia et al . ( 2013 ) ; Fukaya 62 et al . ( 2016b ) ; Park et al . ( 2019 ) ; Lammers et al . ( 2020 ) ; Berrocal et al . ( 2020 ) ; Fukaya ( 2021 ) ) . Thus , 63 multiple regulatory strategies together realize gene - expression patterns in space and time ( Fig . 1E ) . 64 time control of the transcriptionrate RN AP l oad i ng r a t e E control of the transcriptiononset time D control of the fraction of active loci C B RN AP l oad i ng r a t e A outputmRNA input transcription factor Figure 1 .

( RNAP , RNA polymerase II ) . Intense theoretical scrutiny ( Desponds et al . , 2016 ; Fakhouri et al . , 2010 ; Sayal et al . , 2016 ; 65 Estrada et al . , 2016 ; Scholes et al . , 2017 ; Dufourt et al . , 2018 ; Park et al . , 2019 ; Eck et al . , 2020 ; 66 Cheng et al . , 2021 ) has generated a compelling hypothesis : that the regulation of transcriptional 67 dynamics can be separated into two stages . First , a promoter must pass through a series of kinetic 68 barriers consisting of reactions catalyzed by transcription factors in order for for loci to engage in 69 transcription . Previous analyses of the mean and distribution in transcriptional onset times have 70 2 of 41 suggested that the number of inactive promoter states can range from one to three ( Dufourt et al . , 71 2018 ; Eck et al . , 2020 ; Harden et al . , 2021 ) . These reactions could be associated with , for example , 72 the stepwise unwrapping of DNA from nucleosomes ( Desponds et al . , 2016 ; Dufourt et al . , 2018 ; 73 Eck et al . , 2020 ) and / or the sequential recruitment of general transcriptional cofactors ( Zhou et al . , 74 1998 ) . Second , after initial promoter activation , the rate of mRNA production is proportional to 75 the probability of ﬁnding RNA polymerase II ( RNAP ) bound to the promoter . Statistical mechanical 76 ( also called thermodynamic ) models have been used to calculate this probability of ﬁnding RNAP 77 bound to the promoter , and have successfully use to predict mRNA production rates in bacteria 78 ( Razo - Mejia et al . , 2018 ) . However , whether they can be applied to the more complex context of 79 eukaryotic transcriptional regulation—let alone to the dynamical processes of cellular decision - 80 making in development—is still an open question ( Polach and Widom , 1995 ; Schulze and Wallrath , 81 2006 ; Lam et al . , 2008 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Kim and O’Shea , 2008 ; Levine , 2010 ; Fussner et al . , 2011 ; Bai 82 et al . , 2011 ; Li et al . , 2014 ; Hansen and O’Shea , 2015 ; Estrada et al . , 2016 ; Li and Eisen , 2018 ; Park 83 et al . , 2019 ; Eck et al . , 2020 ) . 84 One of the main challenges to systematically testing these models is the complexity of en - 85 dogenous regulatory regions ( Fakhouri et al . , 2010 ; Foo et al . , 2014 ; Sayal et al . , 2016 ; Dufourt 86 et al . , 2018 ; Park et al . , 2019 ; Eck et al . , 2020 ) . Because endogenous enhancers contain multiple 87 binding sites for diﬀerent transcription factors , accounting for these sites and their interactions 88 leads to a combinatorial explosion of model parameters ( Garcia et al . , 2016 , 2020 ) ; determin - 89 ing the values of these parameters from simple experiments constitutes a computational—and 90 conceptual—challenge ( Vincent et al . , 2016 ; Garcia et al . , 2016 , 2020 ) . To render complex transcrip - 91 tional regulatory systems tractable to theory , minimal synthetic enhancers have been engineered 92 in bacteria ( Garcia and Phillips , 2011 ; Brewster et al . , 2014 ; Razo - Mejia et al . , 2018 ; Phillips et al . , 93 2019 ) , eukaryotic cells ( Popp et al . , 2020 ) , and developing organisms ( Fakhouri et al . , 2010 ; Sayal 94 et al . , 2016 ) . In such experiments , a short , synthetic DNA sequence with only one to a few binding 95 sites for a single transcription factor drives the expression of a reporter gene . Measuring the 96 concentration of the transcription - factor input and reporter mRNA output makes it possible to test 97 models of transcriptional regulation and to infer molecular parameters that can be used to predict 98 the behavior of more complex regulatory architectures ( Phillips et al . , 2019 ) . 99 Here we sought to use synthetic minimal enhancers to challenge our integrated model of 100 transcriptional control using the dorsoventral patterning system in Drosophila embryos , in which 101 a concentration gradient of the Dorsal transcription factor speciﬁes spatial domains of transcrip - 102 tion , as a case study . To test the integrated model of transcriptional dynamics ( Fig . 2A , B ) , we 103 performed simultaneous quantitative live - cell measurements of Dorsal concentration ( input ) and 104 transcription ( output ) driven by minimal synthetic Dorsal - dependent enhancers in single nuclei . 105 By repurposing the parS - ParB DNA labeling technology ( Germier et al . , 2017 ; Chen et al . , 2018 ) to 106 quantify transcriptional activity independent of RNA detection , we determined that the inactive 107 loci described by our model constitute a distinct transcriptional state under regulatory control and 108 are not the result of detection artifacts . Further , our theoretical model predicted how , through 109 the Dorsal - mediated catalysis of reactions prior to transcriptional onset , regulatory architecture 110 dictates both the transcriptional onset time and the fraction of active loci . Finally , once promoters 111 turn on , we found that our measurements are compatible with an equilibrium model . Thus , the 112 present investigation provides quantitative evidence supporting a uniﬁed model of transcriptional 113 regulation in eukaryotes that accounts for whether loci become transcriptionally active , when this 114 activity ensues , and , once transcription ensues , at what rate nascent RNA molecules are produced . 115 More generally , our work demonstrates the feasibility of using minimal synthetic enhancers to 116 engage in a dialogue between theory and experiment in the context of transcriptional control in 117 development . 118 3 of 41 2 Results 119 2 . 1 An integrated model of transcriptional dynamics driven by a single activator 120 binding site 121 To probe the transcriptional regulatory strategies ( Fig . 1 ) of a minimal synthetic enhancer , we posit 122 a theoretical model that predicts the fraction of loci that will become active , their transcriptional 123 onset time , and RNAP loading dynamics once transcription ensues . Speciﬁcally , we consider a 124 simpliﬁed case in which only one activator is present and can only bind to one site only a few base 125 pairs away from the promoter ( Fig . 2 ) . 126 In order to explain the transcriptional onset dynamics of a locus and the probability of loci 127 becoming active , we invoke recent experiments leading to a ‘kinetic barrier’ model ( Desponds et al . , 128 2016 ; Dufourt et al . , 2018 ; Eck et al . , 2020 ) proposing that , after exiting mitosis , all promoters are in 129 an inactive state . In this state , labeled as ‘OFF 1 ’ in Figure 2A , transcription is not possible . Promoters 130 must then traverse a series of distinct inactive states ( labeled ‘OFF 2 ’ to ‘OFF 𝑛 ’ in Fig . 2A ) before 131 reaching an active state in which transcription proceeds ( labeled ON in Fig . 2A ) . 132 The temporal evolution of the enhancer - promoter system as it traverses the states shown in 133 Figure 2A can be simulated by computing the probability that the promoter occupies each state . 134 Here , the transition rates between states , 𝑘 , determines how the states probability spreads from 135 the initial condition where the promoter is in state OFF 1 to the active state as time passes ( see 136 Section S1 . 1 for details ) . 137 We propose that a transcriptional activator such as Dorsal can catalyze the transition between 138 states in an aﬃnity - dependent manner via binding to its cognate site in the enhancer . Because we 139 assume that Dorsal binding and unbinding is faster than the transition rate 𝑘 , we posit that 𝑘 is a 140 linear function of the equilibrium Dorsal occupancy at the enhancer such that 141 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑐 ⋅ [ 𝐷𝑙 ] ( 𝑡 ) 𝐾 𝐷 1 + [ 𝐷𝑙 ] ( 𝑡 ) 𝐾 𝐷 , ( 1 ) where 𝑐 is a rate constant , [ 𝐷𝑙 ] ( 𝑡 ) is the Dorsal concentration at time 𝑡 , and 𝐾 𝐷 is the Dorsal - DNA 142 dissociation constant . 143 Because Dorsal is time - varying , the model cannot be solved analytically . As a result , we numeri - 144 cally calculated the probability of the promoter being in each state as a function of time using a 145 particular set of model parameters ( see details in Section S1 . 1 ) . As seen in Figure 2C , because 146 individual loci must traverse a sequence of intermediate states before reaching the ON state , this 147 model introduces a delay in activation . 148 This kinetic barrier model accounts for loci that never transcribe during the nuclear cycle . 149 Speciﬁcally , if nuclear cycles lasted indeﬁnitely , all promoters would eventually reach the ON state 150 as shown in Figure 2C . However , due to the rapid mitotic cycles that characterize early embryonic 151 development in Drosophila , this duration is limited : transcription cannot initiate during mitosis 152 and thus is only permissible during a time window within interphase ( Fig . 2C , vertical dashed line ; 153 Shermoen and O’Farrell ( 1991 ) ; Garcia et al . ( 2013 ) ; Eck et al . ( 2020 ) ) . Consequently , if the time 154 it takes a promoter to reach the ON state is longer than the duration of this window , then this 155 hypothetical promoter will not initiate transcription at all during the nuclear cycle ( Fig . 2C , horizontal 156 dashed line ) . 157 The kinetic barrier model can be used to predict two of the three regulatory strategies , fraction 158 of active loci and transcription onset times , that we aim to dissect quantitatively ( Fig . 1 ) . First , the 159 model predicts how the fraction of active loci is determined by Dorsal nuclear concentration and 160 binding aﬃnity ( Fig . 2D , left y - axis ) . Second , this same model calculates the mean transcriptional 161 onset time of those loci that turn on as a function of these same Dorsal parameters ( Fig . 2D , right 162 y - axis ) . 163 To model a locus once it is active , we follow Eck et al . ( 2020 ) and propose a simple thermody - 164 namic model ( Bintu et al . , 2005b , a ) that assumes that the RNAP loading rate , 𝑅 , is proportional to 165 4 of 41 the probability of ﬁnding RNAP bound to the promoter 𝑝 𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 , such that 166 𝑅 = 𝑅 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ⋅ 𝑝 𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 , ( 2 ) where 𝑅 𝑚𝑎𝑥 is a constant coeﬃcient that dictates the maximum possible polymerase loading rate . 167 Thermodynamic models enable the calculation of 𝑝 𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 by assigning a statistical weight to each 168 possible state in which the regulatory system can be found . In the case of a minimal enhancer 169 with one activator binding site , the enhancer - promoter DNA can be empty , occupied by Dorsal , 170 occupied by RNAP , or simultaneously bound by Dorsal and RNAP ( Fig . 2B ) . The statistical weight 171 associated with each of these terms is shown in Figure 2B . Here , [ 𝐷𝑙 ] / [ 𝐾 𝐷 ] is the statistical weight 172 associated with ﬁnding Dorsal ( with concentration [ 𝐷𝑙 ] and binding dissociation constant 𝐾 𝐷 ) bound 173 to the promoter alone , while [ 𝑃 ] / [ 𝐾 𝑃 ] is the weight of ﬁnding RNAP ( with concentration [ 𝑃 ] and 174 binding dissociation constant 𝐾 𝑃 ) bound to the promoter alone . Note that the weight of having 175 both Dorsal and RNAP bound simultaneously includes an extra glue - like cooperativity coeﬃcient , 𝜔 , 176 that determines how strongly Dorsal recruits RNAP to the promoter . The value of 𝜔 is constrained 177 to be > 1 so that higher Dorsal occupancy leads to higher RNAP occupancy . 178 To calculate 𝑝 𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 , we divide the sum of the weights featuring a bound RNAP molecule by the 179 sum of all possible weights . Substituting this calculation into Equation 2 yields 180 𝑅 = 𝑅 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ⋅ 𝑝 𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 = 𝑅 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ⋅ [ 𝑃 ] 𝐾 𝑃 + [ 𝐷𝑙 ] 𝐾 𝐷 [ 𝑃 ] 𝐾 𝑃 𝜔 1 + [ 𝐷𝑙 ] 𝐾 𝐷 + [ 𝑃 ] 𝐾 𝑃 + [ 𝐷𝑙 ] 𝐾 𝐷 [ 𝑃 ] 𝐾 𝑃 𝜔 , ( 3 ) which is plotted in Figure 2E . As shown in the ﬁgure , increasing 𝐾 𝐷 shifts the concentration at which 181 the RNAP loading rate reaches half its maximum value toward higher Dorsal concentrations , but 182 does not change the overall shape of the curve . We also note the presence of a non - zero baseline 183 of RNAP loading rate due to the Dorsal - independent [ 𝑃 ] / [ 𝐾 𝑃 ] term in the numerator of Equation 3 . 184 This baseline suggests that it could be possible for a promoter in the ’ON’ state to produce low , 185 basal - level transcription in the absence of bound Dorsal . 186 Together , the kinetic barrier model outlined in Figure 2A and the thermodynamic model’s 187 Equation 3 deﬁne a comprehensive quantitative framework that predicts how the fraction of active 188 loci , the transcriptional onset time , and the RNAP loading rate as a function of Dorsal concentration 189 vary as model parameters such as the Dorsal dissociation constant 𝐾 𝐷 are modulated ( Fig . 2D , E ) . 190 These predictions constitute hypotheses that we experimentally tested throughout the remainder 191 of this work . 192 5 of 41 weight state 1 [ Dl ] K D [ P ] K P [ Dl ] K D [ P ] K P Dorsal Dorsal binding site RNAP promoter A 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 . 1 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 time since anaphase ( min ) f r a c t i on o f l o c i c u t o ff t i m e fraction of ON loci D OFF 1 OFF 2 OFF 3 ON state OFF 4 permissible transcriptional window nuclear cycle B E 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 m ean t r an sc r i p t i ona l on s e t ( m i n ) f r a c t i on o f O N l o c i D o r s a l b i nd i ng K D ( a . u . ) 10 1 10 2 10 3 Dorsal concentration ( a . u ) 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 Dorsal concentration ( a . u . ) RN AP l oad i ng r a t e ( R ) ( a . u . / m i n ) C transcription onset RNA polymerase II loading rate OFF 1 OFF 2 OFF n ON k ( [ Dl ] ) Dorsal . . . rate R max R max 0 0 k ( [ Dl ] ) k ( [ Dl ] ) k ( [ Dl ] ) D o r s a l b i nd i ng K D ( a . u . ) Figure 2 .

Dorsal is one of the best characterized transcription factors in Drosophila and a classic 196 example of a morphogen ( Roth et al . , 1989 ; Reeves et al . , 2012 ) . Dorsal is provided maternally and 197 forms a dorsoventral gradient of nuclear localization ( Fig . 3A ) ( Gilbert , 2010 ) , acting as an activator 198 by default ( Thisse et al . , 1991 ; Jiang et al . , 1991 ) and as a repressor in the presence of nearby 199 binding sites for corepressors ( Kirov et al . , 1993 ; Papagianni et al . , 2018 ) . Prior to activation of 200 the zygotic genome ( up to the 12th mitotic cycle ) , Dorsal is the only transcription factor with a 201 nuclear protein gradient across the dorsoventral axis ( Sandler and Stathopoulos , 2016 ; Dufourt 202 6 of 41 et al . , 2020 ) . Thus , the Dorsal nuclear concentration is the sole source of dorsoventral positional 203 information for developmental enhancers at this stage in development . These features , combined , 204 make Dorsal an ideal input transcription factor for activating a minimal synthetic reporter system . 205 In order to relate output transcriptional activity to the time - variant input Dorsal concentration 206 throughout development , we measured the instantaneous Dorsal concentration in live embryos 207 by creating a CRISPR knock - in Dorsal - mVenus fusion allele based on a previous Dorsal fusion 208 ( Reeves et al . , 2012 ) that rescues embryonic development ( Kremers et al . ( 2006 ) ; Gratz et al . ( 2015 ) ; 209 Materials and methods ) . Further , in order to increase the dynamic range of Dorsal concentration in 210 our experiments , we further combined this CRISPR allele with a Dorsal - mVenus transgene ( Reeves 211 et al . , 2012 ) , resulting in a line that will hereafter be referred to as 2x Dorsal ﬂies . This fusion 212 made it possible to quantify the concentration dynamics of the Dorsal protein input ( Fig . 3A , B ) in 213 individual nuclei ( Video S4 , left ; Materials and methods ) . Dorsal - mVenus nuclear ﬂuorescence 214 time traces quantiﬁed over nuclear cycle 12 conﬁrmed the dynamic nature of Dorsal concentration 215 and were quantitatively similar to previous measurements ( Fig . 3B ; Reeves et al . ( 2012 ) ; details of 216 Dorsal - mVenus quantiﬁcation in Fig . S5A , B ) . Nuclear cycle 12 nuclei in 2x Dorsal ﬂies experience a 217 Dorsal concentration gradient spanning multiple orders of magnitude , from less than 1 nM to ≈ 218 400 nM ( Fig . 3B ; details of Dorsal - mVenus calibration in Fig . S6 ) . 219 To visualize the dynamics of Dorsal - dependent transcription , we developed a reporter transgene 220 containing a minimal synthetic enhancer consisting of a single high aﬃnity , consensus binding site 221 for the Dorsal transcription factor ( Ip et al . , 1992 ; Jiang and Levine , 1993 ; Szymanski and Levine , 222 1995 ) ( Fig . 3C ) . Hereafter we refer to this strong site enhancer as as DBS _ 6 . 23 for Dorsal Binding 223 Site , followed by its binding aﬃnity score according to the Patser algorithm ( Stormo and Hartzell 224 ( 1989 ) ; Materials and methods ) . To quantify the transcriptional activity of this enhancer , we used 225 the MS2 - MCP system to ﬂuorescently label nascent RNA molecules in our reporter constructs , which 226 appear as nuclear ﬂuorescent puncta ( hereafter “transcription spots” ) in laser - scanning confocal 227 microscopy movies ( Video S4 , right ; Bertrand et al . ( 1998 ) ; Garcia et al . ( 2013 ) ; Lucas et al . ( 2013 ) . 228 We performed image analysis of the MS2 movies using a custom data analysis pipeline in Matlab 229 and Fiji ( Materials and methods ; ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ; Lammers et al . , 2020 ) . 230 To validate this minimal synthetic system , we determined that DBS _ 6 . 23 - MS2 drives detectable 231 and quantiﬁable levels of transcription , and that this transcriptional activity is mainly governed by 232 Dorsal . We compared the transcriptional activity of DBS _ 6 . 23 - MS2 in embryos laid by 2x Dorsal 233 females with the activity in embryos laid by females homozygous for a dorsal null allele . While 234 transcription spots were clearly present in the 2x Dorsal background ( Fig . 3D , left ) , they were 235 extremely rare in dorsal null embryos ( Fig . 3D , middle ) : not a single transcription spot was detected 236 during nuclear cycle 12 in any of 4 replicates containing > 60 nuclei in total . Dorsal is therefore 237 necessary for transcriptional activity in our reporter constructs . 238 We next sought to determine whether the detected transcriptional activation is solely due to 239 Dorsal interacting with the binding site explicitly engineered into the construct or whether there 240 are cryptic Dorsal binding sites contributing to gene expression . We generated a second reporter , 241 DBS _ 4 . 29 - MS2 in which the Dorsal binding site was strongly perturbed using known point mutations 242 ( Ip et al . , 1992 ) . Transcription was rarely detectable in DBS _ 4 . 29 - MS2 embryos ( Fig . 3D , right ) , with 243 the average transcriptional activity ( mean instantaneous ﬂuorescence ) per detected spot being less 244 than 10 % of the optimal DBS _ 6 . 23 enhancer at any Dorsal concentration ( Fig . S9 ) . Thus , the Dorsal 245 site placed within the synthetic enhancer is necessary for robust activation and is the main driver 246 of this transcriptional activity . 247 Next , we identiﬁed which observable features in the MS2 signal could be used as metrics for 248 quantifying Dorsal - dependent transcriptional activity . We collected DBS _ 6 . 23 - MS2 time traces of 249 MCP - mCherry ﬂuorescence from transcription spots during nuclear cycle 12 along with four metrics 250 of transcriptional activity ( Fig . 3E , F ) . First , the maximum spot ﬂuorescence corresponds to the 95th 251 percentile of intensity over time , which is proportional to the transcription rate ( Section S1 . 2 ) . 252 Second , the transcriptional onset time is deﬁned as the time since the previous mitosis at which a 253 7 of 41 transcription spot is ﬁrst detected ( Fig . S3 ) . Third , the integrated spot ﬂuorescence corresponds 254 to the time integral of the spot ﬂuorescence and is directly proportional to the amount of mRNA 255 produced by the locus ( Garcia et al . , 2013 ) ( Materials and methods ) . Finally , as previously observed 256 in other genes in ﬂies ( Garcia et al . , 2013 ; Dufourt et al . , 2018 ; Lammers et al . , 2020 ; Harden et al . , 257 2021 ) , not all nuclei exposed to the same average nuclear Dorsal concentration exhibited detectable 258 transcription ( Fig . 3F ) . As a result , we quantiﬁed the fraction of active loci—regardless of their level 259 of activity or temporal dynamics—by measuring the number of nuclei with observable transcription 260 signal in at least one movie frame throughout nuclear cycle 12 , divided by the total number of 261 nuclei in the ﬁeld of view . Thus , we have established quantitative metrics that enable us to engage 262 in a dialogue between experiment and a theory of Dorsal - driven transcriptional dynamics . 263 8 of 41 A B E C Dorsal binding site minimalenhancer 24xMS2 loops lacZ tubulin 3’UTR MS2 stem loop MCP - mCherry RNAP 14bp ventral dorsal ventral lateral 10 μm cross - section dorsal time ( min ) 0 40 80 120 160 200 0 2 4 6 8 onset time m a x i m u m f l uo r e sc en c e s po t f l uo r e sc en c e ( a . u . ) integrated fluorescence D time into nuclear cycle 12 ( min ) nu c l ea r m V enu s f l uo r e sc en c e ( a . u ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 lateralventraldorsal 10 µm F 5 10 15 time into nuclear cycle 12 ( min ) 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 nu c l eu s 50100150200250300 0 0 a c t i v e l o c i ( 56 % ) spot fluorescence ( a . u . ) i na c t i v e l o c i ( 44 % ) + Dorsal protein strong binding site – Dorsal protein strong binding site + Dorsal protein weak binding site even - skipped minimal promoter dorsoventral axis position [ Dl ] 0 100 200 300 nu c l ea r D l c on c en t r a t i on ( n M ho m od i m e r s ) Figure 3 .

( E ) Example ﬂuorescence time traces and quantitative metrics of transcriptional activity . ( F ) Fluorescence of all transcription spots in individual nuclei in the ﬁeld of view of one embryo as a function of time . If a transcription spot was detected within a nucleus at any point during the interphase of nuclear cycle 12 , then the locus was considered active ; otherwise , the locus was classiﬁed as inactive . 9 of 41 2 . 3 Transcriptionally active and inactive loci correspond to functionally distinct 264 populations 265 Before attempting to predict Dorsal - driven transcriptional dynamics , it is important to ensure 266 that the fact that only some loci engage in transcription is the result of Dorsal action and not of 267 limitations of our experimental setup . Transcriptionally silent loci that remain inactive throughout 268 interphase , such as those revealed by our experiment ( Fig . 3F ) , have been observed using MS2 ( and 269 its sister mRNA labeling tool , PP7 ) in live - imaging experiments in ﬂies ( Garcia et al . , 2013 ; Lammers 270 et al . , 2020 ; Berrocal et al . , 2020 ) , plants ( Alamos et al . , 2020 ) , and mammalian cells ( Hafner et al . , 271 2020 ) . However , it has not been possible to determine whether these inactive loci correspond to a 272 separate transcriptional state from active loci , or whether they are an artifact of the ﬂuorescence 273 detection thresholds associated with various microscopy techniques . 274 To answer this question , it is necessary to quantify MS2 ﬂuorescence at these inactive loci 275 and determine whether they diﬀer from loci not exposed to activators , which do not transcribe 276 ( Fig . 3F ) . However , to date this approach has not been feasible because most MS2 measurements 277 have relied on the presence of an MS2 signal itself to segment and quantify the ﬂuorescence of 278 transcription spots . We hypothesized that , if undetected loci correspond to a distinct and weaker , 279 Dorsal - independent state , then detected and undetected spots in embryos carrying wild - type 280 Dorsal would appear as two distinct populations . In this scenario , the mCherry ﬂuorescence of 281 undetected spots corresponding to inactive loci in wild - type Dorsal embryos would be similar to 282 that observed in Dorsal null embryos , and clearly distinct from the mCherry ﬂuorescence of active 283 loci in the presence of Dorsal . 284 To quantify MS2 ﬂuorescence independently of whether a MS2 spot was detected , we im - 285 plemented the parS - ParB DNA labeling system ( Germier et al . , 2017 ; Chen et al . , 2018 ) . Here , 286 ﬂuorescently labeled ParB proteins bind the parS DNA sequence resulting in a ﬂuorescence spot 287 appearing at the locus independently of the transcriptional state of the locus ( Fig . 4A ) . We created 288 ﬂies with and without functional Dorsal expressing ParB2 - eGFP ( subsequently referred to as ParB - 289 eGFP ) and MCP - mCherry to label our locus DNA and nascent RNA , respectively . We crossed ﬂies 290 containing parS - DBS _ 6 . 23 - MS2 to ﬂies carrying ParB - eGFP and MCP - mCherry to generate embryos 291 that have our locus of interest labeled with ParB - eGFP colocalized with the transcriptional signal in 292 the MCP - mCherry channel ( Fig . 4A , B ; Video S4 ) . 293 Guided by the spatial positions reported by ParB - eGFP , we measured the MCP - mCherry signal 294 at all DBS _ 6 . 23 reporter loci in embryos carrying wild - type Dorsal ( Fig . 4C ) or laid by mothers 295 homozygous for the dl 1 null allele ( Dorsal null embryos ) . We then classiﬁed loci from wild - type 296 Dorsal embryos into two categories , detected and undetected , depending on whether they were 297 identiﬁed as spots in the MCP - mCherry channel by our analysis pipeline ( Fig . 4B , C ; Section 4 . 5 ) . As 298 shown in the the examples presented in Figure 4D , there are clear qualitative diﬀerences between 299 MCP - mCherry ﬂuorescence time traces corresponding to detected or undetected transcriptional 300 spots from wild - type embryos . Thus , our analysis made it possible to quantify MS2 ﬂuorescence in 301 three populations : all loci in Dorsal null embryos , undetected loci in wild - type Dorsal embryos , and 302 detected loci in wild - type Dorsal embryos . 303 To compare these populations , we computed the 95th percentile value over each locus’ MCP - 304 mCherry ﬂuorescence time trace ( Fig . 4E ) . The distribution of mCherry ﬂuorescence from undetected 305 spots in wild - type Dorsal embryos largely overlapped with that of all spots in Dorsal - null embryos 306 ( Fig . 4F ) , consistent with these two populations corresponding to loci expressing Dorsal - independent 307 levels of activity . Moreover , both distributions were clearly distinct from the distribution of detected 308 spots in wild - type Dorsal embryos ( Fig . 4E , F ) . Thus , our results provide strong evidence that inactive 309 loci are not artifacts of the detection limit of our imaging techniques . Rather , loci can belong to 310 one of two distinct populations : those that transcribe at a high , Dorsal - dependent level and those 311 that are transcriptionally inactive ( or active at a low , undetectable level that is comparable to that of 312 embryos lacking Dorsal ) . We therefore conclude that the decision to transcribe made by each locus 313 10 of 41 is an additional regulatory strategy controlled by Dorsal . 314 From the observations in Figure 4E and F , we estimated our error in classifying loci as inactive . 315 This false - negative detection rate , corresponding to the area under the curve shaded in the inset 316 of Figure 4F , is estimated as 15 . 9 % . However , this false - negative rate is likely an underestimation . 317 For example , this rate may depend on Dorsal concentration , which cannot be controlled for in 318 this experiment . Additionally , the presence of ParB in the locus may itself aﬀect transcriptional 319 dynamics , impacting the false - negative rate . For these reasons , we do not attempt to correct our 320 measurements of the fraction of active loci using this estimated false - negative rate . 321 eGFP 24xMS2 enhancer + promoter parS site spacer . . .

Tuning transcription factor - DNA binding aﬃnity has been a powerful tool to test models 327 of transcriptional regulation in the past ( Meijsing et al . , 2009 ; Phillips et al . , 2019 ) . Inspired by 328 these previous works , we probed our model by adjusting the Dorsal - DNA interaction energy in our 329 minimal synthetic enhancer . 330 We constructed a series of enhancers containing a single binding site with varying aﬃnities for 331 Dorsal . Building on the optimal DBS _ 6 . 23 and the mutated DBS _ 4 . 29 sites ( Fig . 3D , left vs . right ) , we 332 created ﬁve additional enhancers of varying intermediate strengths by introducing point mutations 333 into the consensus Dorsal binding motif to obtain a range of predicted aﬃnities ( Fig . 5A , B ; Materials 334 and methods Section 4 . 1 ) . As described above , we refer to these enhancers as DBS , followed by 335 their corresponding Patser score . 336 For the purpose of quantifying output transcriptional activity as a function of Dorsal concentra - 337 tion , we assigned a single Dorsal concentration value to each nucleus corresponding to the mVenus 338 ﬂuorescence in the center of that nucleus at a ﬁducial time point halfway through each nucleus’s 339 lifetime , approximately in the middle of nuclear cycle 12 when Dorsal levels are relatively stable 340 ( Fig . S5A , B ) . We next grouped nuclei into 17 linearly spaced bins that span the dorsoventral axis 341 based on their ﬁducial ﬂuorescence ( Fig . S5B ) . 342 We assessed whether these point mutations were suﬃcient to generate a graded response to 343 Dorsal and to determine the dynamic range of gene expression aﬀorded by these enhancers . To 344 make this possible , we integrated the total mRNA output over nuclear cycle 12 of each enhancer as 345 a function of Dorsal concentration across all nuclei exposed to a given Dorsal concentration . The 346 integrated mRNA output of the four weakest enhancers changed little across the dorsoventral axis 347 ( Fig . 5C ) . However , an appreciable trend in integrated mRNA was observed for the three strongest 348 aﬃnities ( Fig . 5C ) . Further , plotting the total mRNA integrated across the entire dorsoventral axis of 349 the embryo as a function of Patser score revealed that binding - site aﬃnity ( as reported by Patser 350 score ) is strongly correlated with transcriptional output in our single binding site enhancers ( Fig . 5C , 351 inset ) . In the case of this measure , there was also a threshold aﬃnity : enhancers containing binding 352 sites with aﬃnities below that of DBS _ 5 . 13 showed no substantial diﬀerences in transcriptional 353 activity ( inset , Fig . 5C ) . 354 We used these constructs to measure mean transcriptional onset time as a function of Dorsal 355 concentration and binding aﬃnity , one of the key magnitudes predicted by our model ( Fig . 2D ) . The 356 measured mean onset time was relatively constant at ≈ 5 minutes across all Dorsal concentrations 357 and enhancer constructs ( Fig . 5D , dotted lines ) . This value is consistent with the measured onset 358 times of other early embryonic genes such as the minimal hunchback promoter P2P ( Garcia et al . , 359 2013 ; Lucas et al . , 2013 ; Eck et al . , 2020 ) . 360 We also determined that the fraction of active loci is highly sensitive to Dorsal concentrations 361 and Dorsal binding - site aﬃnity ( Fig . 5D , dashed lines ) . The strongest Dorsal binding sites showed 362 a large modulation of the fraction of active loci across Dorsal concentrations , while the weakest 363 drove a relatively constant and low fraction of active loci across all Dorsal concentrations ( Fig . 5D ) . 364 Our kinetic barrier model assumes that loci which fail to become active during the permissible 365 transcription time window will remain inactive during the rest of the nuclear cycle ( Fig . 2C ) . As a 366 result , to determine whether the kinetic barrier model recapitulates the observations in Figure 5D , it 367 was necessary to assign a value to this time window . We reasoned that the end of this time window 368 determines the time point at which new transcription spots can no longer appear , possibly due 369 to the onset of the next round of mitosis . To estimate the time point when nearly all spots have 370 turned on , we calculated the 95th percentile of the observed spot onset times across all aﬃnities : 371 12 of 41 ≈ 7 . 1 min after the previous anaphase ( Fig . 5E ) . 372 Using the measured time window of permissible transcription , we performed a simultaneous 373 ﬁt to the fraction of active loci and mean transcription onset times across all enhancers using 374 the kinetic barrier model from Section 2 . 1 ( Fig . 5D ) . Consistent with our model , we forced all 375 enhancers to share the same value for 𝑐 , and only letting the Dorsal dissociation constant , 𝐾 𝐷 , 376 vary for each enhancer separately . By systematically exploring models with diﬀerent numbers 377 of OFF states 𝑛 ( Fig . S10 , Fig . S11 ) , we determined that a biochemical cascade with at least 3 to 378 4 rate - limiting OFF states is capable of capturing the qualitative behavior of our observations : a 379 Dorsal concentration - and binding aﬃnity - dependent fraction of active loci ( dashed lines in Fig . 5D ) 380 and a mean transcription onset time that is mostly constant across Dorsal concentrations and 381 aﬃnities ( dotted lines in Fig . 5D ) . Interestingly , alternative functional forms for 𝑘 , such as modeling 382 this transition rate as depending linearly on Dorsal concentration , instead of depending on Dorsal 383 DNA occupancy , resulted in worse ﬁts to the fraction of active loci at saturating concentrations of 384 Dorsal ( Section S1 . 5 ; Fig . S4 ) . Thus , our observations can be explained by a model in which Dorsal , 385 through DNA binding , accelerates the promoter’s transition through a sequence of kinetic barriers 386 to a state of active transcription . 387 13 of 41 0 1 2 3 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 D 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 f r a c t i on o f a c t i v e l o c i f r a c t i on o f a c t i v e l o c i DBS _ 6 . 23 DBS _ 5 . 81 DBS _ 5 . 39 DBS _ 5 . 13 DBS _ 4 . 80 DBS _ 4 . 73 DBS _ 4 . 29 b i t s 2 1 0 G G G A A A A C C C A A G T G G DBS _ 6 . 23 G G G A A A A C C A A A G T G G DBS _ 5 . 39 A G G A A A A C C A A A G T G G DBS _ 4 . 29 A G A A A A A C C A A A G T G G DBS _ 4 . 73 Dorsal binding site A G G A A A A C C C A A G T G G DBS _ 5 . 13 G G G A A A T C C C A A G T G G DBS _ 5 . 81 C G G A A A A C C A A A G T G G DBS _ 4 . 80 4 5 6 Affinity ( Patser score ) B 0 1000 2000 3000 Dorsal concentration ( a . u . ) 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 1 . 2 1 . 6 t o t a l m RN A pe r e m b r y o ( a . u . ) C A NR m l a t o t ) . u . a ( o y r b m e r ep x 10 3 4 5 6 0 2 4 6 affinity ( Patser score ) A 6 . 23 5 . 81 5 . 39 5 . 13 4 . 80 4 . 73 4 . 29 x10 3 Patser score c u m u l a t i v e p r obab ili t y 95 % ~ 7 . 1 min E nuclear cycle observed transcription onset times ( min ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 1 permissible transcriptional window f r a c t i on o f a c t i v e l o c i f r a c t i on o f a c t i v e l o c i f r a c t i on o f a c t i v e l o c i t r an sc r i p t i on on s e t t i m e ( m i n ) t r an sc r i p t i on on s e t t i m e ( m i n ) t r an sc r i p t i on on s e t t i m e ( m i n ) f r a c t i on o f a c t i v e l o c i f r a c t i on o f a c t i v e l o c i t r an sc r i p t i on on s e t t i m e ( m i n ) t r an sc r i p t i on on s e t t i m e ( m i n ) t r an sc r i p t i on on s e t t i m e ( m i n ) t r an sc r i p t i on on s e t t i m e ( m i n ) Dorsal concentration ( x10 3 , a . u . ) Dorsal concentration ( x10 3 , a . u . ) Dorsal concentration ( x10 3 , a . u . ) 0 100 200 300 400 Dorsal concentration ( nM homodimers ) Figure 5 .

Typically , in MS2 experiments , the 391 loading rate is measured from the initial slope of spot ﬂuorescence traces ( Garcia et al . , 2013 ; Eck 392 et al . , 2020 ; Liu et al . , 2021 ) . However , due to the weak expression driven by our enhancers , it 393 was not possible to perform this analysis with conﬁdence ( Fig . S8 ) . In lieu of directly measuring 394 the transcription rate , we evaluated a related , more robust and readily observable quantity : the 395 maximum trace ﬂuorescence ( Fig . 3E ) . We approximately relate the RNAP loading rate predicted 396 by the simple activator model ( Equation 3 ) to the maximum ﬂuorescence by a constant factor 397 ( Appendix S1 . 2 ) , enabling direct comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental 398 data . 399 Measurements of the maximum spot ﬂuorescence over time as a function of Dorsal concentra - 400 tion for each of our seven minimal synthetic enhancers revealed that the maximum ﬂuorescence is 401 relatively constant across Dorsal concentration for most binding sites—particularly for the weakest 402 of them , DBS _ 5 . 13 , DBS _ 4 . 73 , and DBS _ 4 . 23 ( Fig . 6 ) . However , the sparse and noisy nature of our 403 data makes it challenging to draw conﬁdent conclusions from the ﬁts , even for the stronger binding 404 sites ( i . e . DBS _ 6 . 23 , DBS _ 5 . 81 , and DBS _ 5 . 39 ) . In the case of the lower aﬃnity binding sites , the 405 constant maximum ﬂuorescence suggests that the Dorsal concentration level in our embryos is far 406 below the Dorsal dissociation constant 𝐾 𝐷 , even after increasing the Dorsal dosage by a factor of 407 two as in our 2x Dorsal line . The eﬀect of very low Dorsal concentrations relative to their respective 408 𝐾 𝐷 values can be clearly seen in Equation 3 and in Figure 2 , where , for [ 𝐷𝑙 ] ∕ 𝐾 𝐷 ≪ 1 , the RNAP 409 loading rate , 𝑅 , adopts a basal level given by 410 𝑅 = 𝑅 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑃 𝐾 𝑃 1 + 𝑃 𝐾 𝑃 ( 4 ) that is independent of Dorsal concentration and binding aﬃnity . 411 As shown on the right y - axes in Figure 6 , this basal level corresponds to ≈ 20 RNAP molecules 412 actively transcribing the gene ( ≈ 15 % of the maximum number of RNAPs that can ﬁt on the gene , as 413 described in Section S1 . 3 ) . For ease of visual comparison to the thermodynamic model predictions , 414 we also plotted best - ﬁt theoretical curves on top of the data using dashed curves ( the insets in Fig . 6 415 show the same plots but zoomed into the measured data and plotted on a linear scale ) . These ﬁts 416 further underscore that our data do not explore a wide dynamic range with the precision necessary 417 to determine the magnitude of 𝐾 𝐷 for each construct and to thoroughly test the thermodynamic 418 model . 419 15 of 41 0 100 200 300 400 100200300400 100200300400 100200300400 10 3 10 4 10 5 100200300400 200300 400 200300 400 1 2 3x10 3 0 1 2 3x10 3 0 1 2 3x10 3 0 1 2 3x10 3 0 1 2 3 10 x 3 0 1 2 3 0 10 x 3 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 3 10 4 10 5 Dorsal concentration ( a . u . ) 10 3 10 4 10 5 m a x i m u m s po t f l uo r e sc en c e ( a . u . ) 0 100 200 300 400 Dorsal concentration ( a . u . ) DBS _ 6 . 23 DBS _ 5 . 81 DBS _ 5 . 39 DBS _ 5 . 13 DBS _ 4 . 80 DBS _ 4 . 73 mean maximum spot fluorescence ± SEM model fit ± 95 % confidence interval 200 300 400 10 x 3 1 2 3 0 10 3 10 4 10 5 DBS _ 4 . 29 10 20 30 40 50 10 20 30 40 50 nu m be r o f RN AP m o l e c u l e s nu m be r o f RN AP m o l e c u l e s m a x i m u m s po t f l uo r e sc en c e ( a . u . ) Figure 6 .

Synthetic minimal enhancers contain binding sites for one or 424 a handful of transcription factors , making them more amenable to theoretical dissection ( Fakhouri 425 et al . , 2010 ; Sayal et al . , 2016 ; Crocker and Ilsley , 2017 ) and revealing the complex interplay among 426 activators , repressors , and pioneer factors , as well as their contribution to mRNA transcript ac - 427 cumulation ( Fakhouri et al . , 2010 ; Sayal et al . , 2016 ; Crocker and Ilsley , 2017 ) . However , previous 428 synthetic - based eﬀorts to dissect enhancer function always involved ﬁxed - embryo measurements , 429 which cannot reveal the three inherently dynamical roles dictated by enhancer sequences ( Fig . 1 ) . 430 Here we augmented previous synthetic approaches by quantifying the real - time action of 431 minimal enhancers with one binding site for the Dorsal activator in single cells of living , developing 432 Drosophila embryos using the MS2 system . Contrary to theoretical speculations that single binding 433 sites within eukaryotic genomes lack enough information to be recognized by transcription factors 434 in the absence of other nearby binding sites ( Wunderlich and Mirny , 2009 ) , we demonstrated 435 that Dorsal can drive expression when bound to single binding sites ( Fig . 3D ) . Additionally , we 436 demonstrated that the fraction of active loci is a feature under regulatory control in our synthetic 437 system ( Fig . 3F ; Fig . 4F ) , conﬁrming the important role of this regulatory strategy in shaping the 438 expression dynamics of endogenous enhancers ( Garcia et al . , 2013 ; Dufourt et al . , 2018 ; Lammers 439 et al . , 2020 ; Harden et al . , 2021 ) . Thus , while the signal driven by our minimal synthetic constructs 440 16 of 41 is weak ( Fig . 6 ) , it can be quantiﬁed and recapitulates biologically relevant dynamic features of 441 transcription that are also at play in endogenous enhancers . 442 It is important to note that the uncovering of a fraction of inactive loci in many reporter systems 443 by us and others ( Garcia et al . , 2013 ; Dufourt et al . , 2018 ; Lammers et al . , 2020 ; Harden et al . , 444 2021 ) did not necessarily imply that this modulation of transcriptional engagement constitutes 445 a biological control variable . Indeed , because live cell imaging techniques typically lack single - 446 molecule resolution , it was unclear whether undetected loci in our study—and all previous studies— 447 corresponded to a distinct population or were a detection artifact . By simultaneously labeling 448 the locus with the transcription - independent reporter ParB - eGFP and nascent mRNA with MCP - 449 mCherry ( Fig . 4A ) , we demonstrated that a signiﬁcant number of loci categorized as inactive do not 450 constitute an experimental artifact and instead correspond to a distinct transcriptional state that is 451 comparable to that measured in the absence of Dorsal protein ( Fig . 4 ) . In the future , conducting all 452 live transcription measurements with DNA loci labeled by ParB could make it possible to conﬁdently 453 quantify the activity of all loci regardless of their activity . 454 Our minimal synthetic constructs and our validation of a distinct population of inactive loci 455 enabled us to test an emerging theoretical model of enhancer action in development : a kinetic 456 barrier model of transcriptional engagement ( Fig . 2A ; Fritzsch et al . ( 2018 ) ; Dufourt et al . ( 2018 ) ; 457 Eck et al . ( 2020 ) ) . Importantly , our model deviated from previous theoretical eﬀorts that assumed 458 that the transition rates between states preceding transcriptional engagement were either constant 459 ( Dufourt et al . , 2018 ) or depended linearly on activator concentration ( Eck et al . , 2020 ) . Instead , 460 in order to account for the eﬀects of Dorsal binding aﬃnity on transcriptional dynamics , we 461 assumed that this rate was proportional to Dorsal occupancy at its target DNA site . Thus , while the 462 mechanisms underlying several aspects of this model , such as the molecular identity of the various 463 OFF states , remain unknown , this model can generate predictions for how the fraction of active 464 loci and the transcriptional onset time are modulated by the Dorsal concentration and its binding 465 aﬃnity ( Fig . 2C - E ) . 466 We systematically challenged this model by generating a small collection of minimal synthetic 467 enhancers spanning a large range of aﬃnities for Dorsal ( Fig . 5A ) . Comparing the fraction of 468 active loci and the transcription onset times of these enhancers revealed that the kinetic barrier 469 model recapitulated our measurements ( Fig . 5D ) . In past studies probing transcription dynamics 470 in the Drosophila embryo ( Dufourt et al . , 2018 ; Eck et al . , 2020 ) , the pioneer factor Zelda was 471 found to be largely responsible for ensuring constant transcription factor onset times and for 472 determining the fraction of active loci . We cannot rule out the potential existence of distant or 473 low - aﬃnity Zelda binding sites ( Rushlow and Shvartsman , 2012 ) in our constructs . Alternatively , 474 as it was recently demonstrated for the Bicoid activator Hannon et al . ( 2017 ) , Dorsal could also 475 have a pioneering activity . Indeed , the Dorsal homolog NF - 𝜅 B has been recently shown to displace 476 nucleosomes ( Cheng et al . , 2021 ) . To further test the kinetic barrier model , it would be informative 477 to directly perturb the temporal dynamics of nuclear Dorsal concentration to aﬀect transcriptional 478 engagement . For example , several optogenetics systems have been successfully deployed in the 479 early ﬂy embryo to inactivate transcription factors during discrete time widows ( Huang et al . , 2017 ; 480 McDaniel et al . , 2019 ; Irizarry et al . , 2020 ) . In the future , a version of one of these systems may 481 dissect how the temporal dynamics of Dorsal concentration aﬀect transcriptional activation . 482 Although the kinetic barrier model predicted the fraction of active loci and onset times ( Fig . 5D ) 483 relatively well , we were unable to use our data to conclusively test the thermodynamic model’s 484 predictions of the rate of mRNA production ( Fig . 6 ) . Such limitation stemmed from the fact that only 485 a fraction of loci display detectable transcription that can be used to quantify the mRNA production 486 rate . Further , among these loci , the rate of transcription was found to be highly variable . As a 487 result , our statistics were limited such that it was not possible to perform an unequivocal test of the 488 thermodynamic model . 489 The apparent lack of substantial Dorsal concentration dependence observed in our measure - 490 ments of RNAP loading rate could be explained in two possible ways . First , it is possible that there 491 17 of 41 is a modulation of this rate in our measurements , but that this modulation is obscured by our 492 experimental noise . Second , the Dorsal concentrations accessed by our experiment could be below 493 the 𝐾 𝐷 of our binding sites . In this scenario , a modulation in the mRNA production rate would 494 become apparent only at Dorsal concentrations higher than those attainable by our experimental 495 system . While our embryos contained double the genetic dosage of Dorsal compared to wild type , 496 perhaps 5 - 10 times the wild - type Dorsal concentration could be needed to exceed the 𝐾 𝐷 and 497 modulate the rate of mRNA production . To express this high Dorsal concentration , which is certain 498 to aﬀect normal embryonic development , genetic approaches to increase Dorsal dosage in the 499 embryos similar to those recently applied to ﬂatten the Bicoid gradient might be necessary ( Hannon 500 et al . , 2017 ) . 501 It is important to note that , despite not seeing a modulation in the rate of mRNA production , we 502 do see a signiﬁcant change in the fraction of active loci as Dorsal concentration is varied ( Fig . 5 ) . 503 This seeming contradiction could be explained through the presence of two dissociation constants 504 in our model ( Fig . 2 ) : one dissociation constant for the ﬁrst part of the model governing the onset 505 of transcription , and a diﬀerent dissociation constant for the second part of the model dictating 506 the rate of RNAP loading once transcription has ensued . Interestingly , previous works quantifying 507 transcriptional dynamics of a minimal Bicoid - activated hunchback P2 enhancers also hint at the 508 existence of these two distinct dissociation constants ( Garcia et al . , 2013 ) . 509 Further , this model is consistent with our surprising observation of a basal level of transcription 510 in the presence of even extremely weak binding sites ( Fig . 6 ) despite the lack of detected transcrip - 511 tion in the absence of Dorsal protein ( Fig . 3D , middle ) . This observation could be explained if Dorsal 512 acted as both as a pioneer - like transcription factor triggering the onset of transcription , even at low 513 concentrations relative to its 𝐾 𝐷 , and as an activator of the transcription rate at high concentrations . 514 Going forward , synthetic minimal enhancers could constitute the foundation for exploring the 515 behavior of more complex regulatory regions . Independently inferring biophysical parameters 516 such as Dorsal - DNA binding and dissociation constants could help constrain models of Dorsal 517 participating in the activation of promoters with additional activators and repressors ( Fakhouri et al . , 518 2010 ; Sayal et al . , 2016 ) . Indeed , while Dorsal is the sole maternal nuclear - localized input specifying 519 dorsoventral position in Drosophila , it rarely acts alone in endogenous enhancers ( Hong et al . , 2008 ) . 520 For example , the interaction of Dorsal with Twist is a classic example of positive cooperativity in 521 development ( Szymanski and Levine , 1995 ) . Dorsal can also act as a repressor depending on the 522 presence of nearby Capicua binding sites ( Shin and Hong , 2014 ) . The minimal synthetic enhancers 523 presented here could be used as scaﬀolds for more complex minimal enhancers incorporating a 524 second binding site for Twist or Capicua , for example . 525 In conclusion , we have developed a minimal synthetic enhancer system that has shed light 526 on the fundamental assumptions about transcription in development . By engaging in a dialogue 527 between theory and experiment , we have advanced our understanding of how kinetic processes 528 give rise to important features of transcriptional dynamics in the embryo and made progress toward 529 predictive understanding of how regulatory DNA sequence dictates the functional relation between 530 input transcription factor dynamics and output transcriptional activity in development . 531 4 Methods and materials 532 4 . 1 Plasmids and reporter design 533 To design our minimal construct ( Fig . 3 ) , we placed the 10 bp consensus Dorsal binding site 534 ( Markstein et al . , 2002 ) upstream of the even - skipped core promoter . This enhancer - promoter 535 construct drives the expression of the MS2v5 sequence containing 24 nonrepetitive MS2 loops 536 ( Tutucci et al . , 2018 ) followed by the lacZ coding sequence and the tubulin 3’UTR . ( Garcia et al . , 537 2013 ) . 538 In addition to the consensus Dorsal binding site ( DBS _ 6 . 23 ) , we created six enhancers of varying 539 strength by introducing point mutations to the consensus Dorsal binding motif . Some of these 540 18 of 41 binding sites were taken from known validated Dorsal motifs ( Markstein et al . , 2002 ) , while others 541 were generated based on mutations known to decrease Dorsal binding ( Ip et al . , 1992 ; Jiang et al . , 542 1991 ) . To guide the design of these binding sites , we used an already existing position weight matrix 543 computed with the MEME algorithm ( Ivan et al . , 2008 ; Bailey et al . , 2006 ) using motifs generated 544 by DNAse I footprinting assays ( Bergman et al . , 2005 ) and quantiﬁed the information content of 545 each base pair using Patser ( Hertz and Stormo , 1999 ) . 546 All plasmid sequences used in this study are shown in Table 1 and can be accessed from a public 547 Benchling folder . Injections were carried out by Rainbow inc . or Bestgene inc . 548 4 . 2 Flies 549 Reporter plasmids were injected into BDSC ﬂy line 27388 containing a landing site in position 550 38F1 . Transgene orientation was conﬁrmed by PCR using primers 18 . 8 ( ggaacgaaggcagttagttgt ) and 551 Ori - Seq - F1 ( tagttccagtgaaatccaagcattttc ) binding outside of the 5’ 38F1 attP site and the even - skipped 552 promoter , respectively . All reporter lines were conﬁrmed to be in the same orientation . All ﬂies 553 used in this study can be found in Table 2 . 554 To generate the embryos used in the experiments shown in all ﬁgures except for Figure 4 , we 555 crossed 2x Dorsal or 1x Dorsal virgins to males carrying synthetic enhancers . The genotype of 556 2x Dorsal ﬂies is yw ; Dl - mVenus ( CRISPR ) , MCP - mCherry ; Dorsal - mVenus , MCP - mCherry , His2Av - iRFP . 557 The genotype of 1x Dorsal ﬂies is yw ; dl [ 1 ] , MCP - mCherry ; Dorsal - mVenus , MCP - mCherry , His2Av - iRFP . 558 Because there does not seem to be a diﬀerence in transcriptional activity between the CRISPR 559 knock - in and the transgene Dorsal - mVenus alleles ( Fig . S7 ) , we combined the 1x Dorsal and 2x 560 Dorsal data for some enhancers . 561 MCP - mCherry and His - iRFP were described before by ( Liu et al . , 2021 ) . The Dorsal - mVenus 562 transgene was developed by Reeves et al . ( 2012 ) . 563 To generate the Dorsal - Venus knock - in allele we used the CRISPR / Cas9 protocol described by 564 ( Gratz et al . , 2015 ) . We generated a donor plasmid containing the mVenus sequence followed 565 by a stop codon and a 3xP3 - dsRed marker ﬂanked by PiggyBac recombinase sites . This insert 566 was ﬂanked by two ≈ 1 kbp homology arms matching ≈ 2 kbp surrounding the Dorsal stop codon 567 ( plasmid Dl - mVenus - dsRed in Table 1 ) . The Cas9 expressing BDSC line 51324 was injected with 568 the donor plasmid in combination with a plasmid carrying a sgRNA targeting the sequence GTTGT - 569 GAAAAAGGTATTACG in the C - terminus of Dorsal ( plasmid pU6 - DlgRNA1 in in Table 1 ) . Survivors 570 were crossed to yw and the progeny was screened for dsRed eye ﬂuorescence . Several independent 571 lines were established and tested for rescue . The insertion was conﬁrmed by PCR using primers 572 ﬂanking the homology arms OutLHA ( ccattaaaacggaaccaagaggtgag ) and OutDlRHA ( tctaacaatggctc - 573 gatttttgcca ) . The dsRed eye marker cassette was ﬂipped out of rescuing lines via crossing with a 574 piggyBac recombinase line . The resulting Dorsal - mVenus locus was then resequenced using the 575 same primers . 576 The data shown in Figure 4 were obtained from embryos laid by yw ; ParB2 - eGFP , eNosx2 - MCP - 577 mCherry ; + ( wild - type Dorsal mothers ) or yw ; ParB2 - eGFP , eNosx2 - MCP - mCherry , dl [ 1 ] ; + ( Dorsal null 578 mothers ) . 579 4 . 3 Microscopy 580 Fly cages were allowed to lay for 90 to 120 minutes prior to embryo collection . Embryos were then 581 mounted on microscopy slides in Halocarbon 27 oil ( Sigma - Aldrich , H8773 ) in between a coverslip 582 and breathable membrane as described in ( Garcia et al . , 2013 ; Bothma et al . , 2014 ; Garcia and 583 Gregor , 2018 ) . 584 Confocal microscopy was performed on a Leica SP8 with HyD detectors and a White Light 585 Laser . We used a 63x oil objective , and scanned bidirectionally with a scan rate of 420 Hz and a 586 magniﬁcation of 3 . 4x zoom . We did not use line or frame accumulation . Time - lapse z - stacks were 587 collected with ∼ 10 s frame rate and 106 nm x - y pixel dimensions and 0 . 5 𝜇 m separation between 588 z - slices ( 7 𝜇 M range , 16 slices ) . x - y resolution was 512x512 pixels . Pinhole was set to 1 . 0 Airy units at 589 19 of 41 600 nm . mVenus was excited by a 510 nm laser line calibrated to 5 𝜇 W using the 10x objective and 590 detected in a 520 - 567 nm spectral window . mCherry was excited by a 585 nm laser line calibrated 591 to 25 𝜇 W and detected in a 597 - 660 nm spectral window . To image His2av - iRFP , the 700 nm laser 592 line was set to 10 % and detected in a 700 - 799 nm spectral window . In all channels , detection was 593 performed using the counting mode of the HyD detectors . 594 All movies were taken at ∼ 50 % along the anterior - posterior axis of the embryo . 595 4 . 4 ParB experiment ﬂy crosses and microscopy 596 We created ﬂies with and without functional Dorsal expressing ParB2 - eGFP maternally driven by 597 the nanos promoter and MCP - mCherry driven by two copies of a minimal nanos enhancer to label 598 our locus DNA and nascent mRNA , respectively . In addition , we added a parS sequence followed by 599 a 400 bp spacer ( created with SiteOut , Estrada et al . ( 2016 ) ) to our DBS _ 6 . 23 enhancer . We then 600 crossed male ﬂies containing parS - DBS _ 6 . 23 - MS2 to yw ; ParB2 - eGFP ; eNosx2 - MCP - mCherry ; + females 601 to create embryos that have our locus of interest labeled with eGFP colocalized with transcriptional 602 loci in the MCP - mCherry channel ( Fig . 4A and B ) . 603 After mounting embryos using the protocol described above in Section 4 . 3 , we used the sequen - 604 tial scanning mode on the Leica SP8 confocal microscope to eliminate bleedthrough from eGFP 605 into the mCherry channel , and imaged at approximately 20 s per stack , half the rate used in other 606 imaging experiments in this study . 607 4 . 5 Image and time - series analysis 608 Image analysis was performed in Matlab using the custom pipeline described in Garcia et al . ( 2013 ) 609 and Lammers et al . ( 2020 ) ( this pipeline can be found in the mRNA Dynamics Github repository ) . 610 Image segmentation was also aided by the Trainable Weka Segmentation plugin in FIJI ( Witten et al . , 611 2016 ; Arganda - Carreras et al . , 2017 ) . Further analysis of time - series and other data were likewise 612 performed in Matlab . Movies for publication were made in FIJI ( Schneider et al . , 2012 ; Schindelin 613 et al . , 2012 ) . 614 4 . 6 Measuring Dorsal - mVenus concentration 615 Dorsal - mVenus concentration was calculated as in ( Fig . S5 ) . As shown in the ﬁgure , we measured 616 the average mVenus ﬂuorescence intensity in a circle of 2 𝜇 m radius at the center of the nucleus in 617 every z - slice of each nucleus . This results in a z - proﬁle of ﬂuorescence values covering the nucleus 618 itself and the cytoplasm below and above it . The reported concentration corresponds to the value 619 at the middle z - plane of each nucleus . To ﬁnd this plane , we ﬁt a parabola to the ﬂuorescence 620 z - proﬁle . We use as the nuclear concentration the ﬂuorescence value at the plane corresponding to 621 the ﬁtted parabola’s vertex ( Fig . S5B ) . We then plotted this value over time and selected a single time 622 point for each trace corresponding to the middle of each nucleus’s observed trajectory ( Fig . S5B ) . 623 To determine the background ﬂuorescence in the mVenus channel we imaged ﬂies with the same 624 genotype as 2x Dorsal except for the Dorsal - Venus fusions . We calculated the average nuclear 625 ﬂuorescence in the mVenus channel across nuclear cycle 12 and subtracted this value from our 626 Dorsal - Venus measurements . 627 4 . 7 Curve ﬁtting and parameter inference 628 Curve ﬁtting and parameter inference were performed in Matlab using the MCMCSTAT Matlab 629 package using the DRAM Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm ( Haario et al . , 2006 ) . For simplicity , 630 uniform priors were assumed throughout . 631 5 Acknowledgments 632 We thank Greg Reeves for providing the Dorsal - mVenus and dl 1 ﬂy lines .

The problem posed in Figure 5A , namely the time evolution of the probability of nuclei occupying a discrete number of consecutive states , can be described by the following system of linear diﬀerential equations ( also known as the ‘master equation’ ) 𝑑⃖⃖⃗𝑃 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑲 ( 𝑡 ) ⃖⃖⃗𝑃 , ( S1 ) where ⃖⃖⃗𝑃 is a column vector containing the probability as a function of time of each of the states 901 that the system can be in . 𝑲 corresponds to the transition rate matrix containing the rates that 902 dictate the passage from each OFF state to the next and to the ﬁnal ON state . 903 For 𝑛 OFF states followed by a ON state connected by irreversible transitions with a rate of 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) , 904 Equation S1 can be written as 905 ⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ 𝑑𝑃 ( 𝑂𝐹𝐹 1 , 𝑡 ) 𝑑𝑡 𝑑𝑃 ( 𝑂𝐹𝐹 2 , 𝑡 ) 𝑑𝑡 . . . 𝑑𝑃 ( 𝑂𝐹𝐹 𝑛 , 𝑡 ) ) 𝑑𝑡 𝑑𝑃 ( 𝑂𝑁 , 𝑡 ) 𝑑𝑡 ⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ = ⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ − 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) 0 . . . 0 0 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) − 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) . . . 0 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 0 . . . − 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) 0 0 0 . . . 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) 0 ⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ × ⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ 𝑃 ( 𝑂𝐹𝐹 1 , 𝑡 ) 𝑃 ( 𝑂𝐹𝐹 2 , 𝑡 ) . . . 𝑃 ( 𝑂𝐹𝐹 𝑛 , 𝑡 ) 𝑃 ( 𝑂𝑁 , 𝑡 ) ⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ , ( S2 ) 906 where 𝑃 ( 𝑠 , 𝑡 ) indicates the probability of the system being in state 𝑠 at time 𝑡 . 907 As described in Section 2 . 4 , the transition rate matrix , 𝑲 , is a function of time as a consequence 908 of the assumption that the transition rate between states , 𝑘 , depends on the time - varying Dorsal 909 concentration . In our model , 𝑘 is given by 910 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑐 ⋅ [ 𝐷𝑙 ] ( 𝑡 ) 𝐾 𝐷 1 + [ 𝐷𝑙 ] ( 𝑡 ) 𝐾 𝐷 , ( S3 ) where 𝐾 𝐷 is the Dorsal binding dissociation constant and 𝑐 is a rate constant . If 𝑘 were a constant , 911 then the system of equations describing transcriptional dynamics could be solved analytically . 912 However , because 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) depends on the empirical Dorsal - mVenus ﬂuorescence dynamics , which 913 does not have a concrete functional form , solving the system in Equation S2 becomes analytically 914 intractable . Thus , in order to obtain the probability of each state as a function of time , ⃖⃖⃗𝑃 , and 915 calculate the fraction of active loci and the mean transcription onset times , we solve the system in 916 Equation S2 numerically for a given number of 𝑛 OFF states . Speciﬁcally , at each time step 𝑑𝑡 , we 917 calculated how the probability of each state changes with respect to the previous time step . 918 To calculate 𝑃 ( 𝑠 , 𝑡 ) we need to consider the previous time step 𝑡 − 1 and take into account three 919 possible scenarios : 920 1 . Loci that were already in state 𝑠 at time 𝑡 − 1 and stay in this state at time 𝑡 . 921 2 . Loci that were in state 𝑠 − 1 at 𝑡 − 1 that transition into state 𝑠 at time 𝑡 . 922 3 . Loci that were in state 𝑠 at time 𝑡 − 1 that leave this state by transitioning to the next state 𝑠 + 1 923 at time 𝑡 . 924 The likelihood of a locus jumping from one state to the next at time 𝑡 during an arbitrarily small 925 time window of 𝑑𝑡 is given by the transition rate 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) × 𝑑𝑡 . As a result , the probability of the promoter 926 locus being in state 𝑠 at time 𝑡 can be calculated as 927 𝑃 ( 𝑠 , 𝑡 ) ⏟⏟⏟ Probability of state 𝑠 at time 𝑡 = 𝑃 ( 𝑠 , 𝑡 − 1 ) ⏟⏞⏞⏟⏞⏞⏟ being in state 𝑠 at 𝑡 − 1 + 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑑𝑡𝑃 ( 𝑠 − 1 , 𝑡 − 1 ) ⏟⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏟⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏟ enter from state 𝑠 − 1 − 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑑𝑡𝑃 ( 𝑠 , 𝑡 − 1 ) ⏟⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏟⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏟ leave for state 𝑠 + 1 . ( S4 ) 28 of 41 It is clear that , for 𝑠 = 1 , 𝑃 ( 𝑠 − 1 , 𝑡 − 1 ) = 0 , since there is not a previous state from which loci can 928 enter the ﬁrst OFF state . Similarly , since promoters cannot leave the ﬁnal ON state once they have 929 entered it , 𝑃 ( 𝑛 + 2 , 𝑡 − 1 ) = 0 for 𝑛 OFF states . 930 To obtain the fraction of active loci , we initialize the system to 𝑃 ( 𝑠 = 1 , 𝑡 = 0 ) = 1 and calculate 𝑃 ( 𝑠 = 𝑛 + 1 , 𝑡 = 𝑇 ∕ 𝑑𝑡 ) , where 𝑇 is the duration of the transcriptional window such that Fraction of active loci = 𝑃 ( 𝑛 + 1 , 𝑇 ∕ 𝑑𝑡 ) . ( S5 ) To obtain the mean transcriptional onset time , we calculate the expected value 𝔼 [ 𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑡 ] of the time to reach the ﬁnal 𝑛 + 1 state before the end of the transcriptional time window at 𝑡 = 𝑇 . From the deﬁnition of expected value , 𝔼 [ 𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑡 ] = 𝑖 = 𝑇 ∑ 𝑖 = 1 𝑡 𝑖 × 𝑝 𝑖 , ( S6 ) where 𝑡 𝑖 indicates a given onset time and 𝑝 𝑖 the probability of loci having that speciﬁc onset time . Note that the sum only runs until the end of the transcription time window 𝑇 , as loci that will remain inactive for the duration of the nuclear cycle should not be considered in our calculation of the mean transcriptional onset time . This means that 𝑝 𝑖 is a normalized probability , calculated only amongst loci that turn on before time 𝑇 such that 𝑖 = 𝑇 ∑ 𝑖 = 1 𝑝 𝑖 = 1 . ( S7 ) In terms of the system described in Equation S4 , the probability 𝑝 𝑖 of loci reaching the ON state 𝑛 + 1 at time 𝑡 𝑖 is Probability of loci to turn on at time 𝑡 𝑖 = 𝑃 ( 𝑛 + 1 , 𝑡 𝑖 ) − 𝑃 ( 𝑛 + 1 , 𝑡 𝑖 − 1 ) . ( S8 ) And the normalized probability 𝑝 𝑖 of loci reaching the ON state 𝑛 + 1 at time 𝑡 𝑖 among loci that reach it before 𝑇 is Probability of loci to turn on at time 𝑡 𝑖 ( normalized ) = 𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑃 ( 𝑛 + 1 , 𝑡 𝑖 ) − 𝑃 ( 𝑛 + 1 , 𝑡 𝑖 − 1 ) ∑ 𝑖 = 𝑇 𝑖 = 1 [ 𝑃 ( 𝑛 + 1 , 𝑡 𝑖 ) − 𝑃 ( 𝑛 + 1 , 𝑡 𝑖 − 1 ) ] . ( S9 ) Replacing 𝑝 𝑖 in Equation S6 with its deﬁnition in Equation S9 , we arrive at the formula for the mean transcriptional onset time Mean transcriptionalonsettime = 𝔼 [ 𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑡 ] = 𝑖 = 𝑇 ∑ 𝑖 = 0 𝑡 𝑖 𝑃 ( 𝑛 + 1 , 𝑡 𝑖 ) − 𝑃 ( 𝑛 + 1 , 𝑡 𝑖 − 1 ) ∑ 𝑖 = 𝑇 𝑖 = 1 [ 𝑃 ( 𝑛 + 1 , 𝑡 𝑖 ) − 𝑃 ( 𝑛 + 1 , 𝑡 𝑖 − 1 ) ] . ( S10 ) Note that the solutions for the fraction of active loci ( Eqn . S5 ) and their mean transcription onset time 931 ( Eqn . S9 ) ultimately depend on the Dorsal concentration over time [ 𝐷𝑙 ] ( 𝑡 ) as they determine 𝑃 ( 𝑡 , 𝑛 ) . 932 Hence , to generate predictions that can be directly compared to our live - imaging measurements , 933 we need to solve these equations accounting for the Dorsal - mVenus ﬂuorescence dynamics that 934 determine [ 𝐷𝑙 ] ( 𝑡 ) . 935 S1 . 2 Relating MS2 signal to the statistical mechanical model 936 In order to understand how the maximum MCP - mCherry ﬂuorescence of a locus relates to the 937 average RNAP loading rate , a model for the ﬂuorescence trajectory during a nuclear cycle is required . 938 We start by assuming that RNAP molecules begin loading at a time 𝑡 0 into the nuclear cycle and 939 continue to load at a constant rate proportional to 𝑅 , as shown in Equation 2 ( 𝑅 = 𝑅 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ⋅ 𝑝 𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 ) and 940 step ( 1 ) in Figure S1 . The observed signal increases linearly until the ﬁrst polymerase terminates 941 transcription . At this point , the signal plateaus at the value 𝑓 𝑚𝑎𝑥 because polymerase molecules 942 continue to be loaded onto the gene at a constant rate while simultaneously terminating at the 943 same rate at the end of the gene ( Fig . S1 , step ( 2 ) ) . We note that , in this model , initiation halts at 944 29 of 41 s po t f l uo r e sc en c e first RNAP terminates loadingstops loading rate , R time into nc12 ( min ) promoter MS2 lacZ tub 3’UTR RNAP 1 2 3 1 2 3 B A loading = termination period of constrant RNAP loading Δt elongation Figure S1 . Trapezoid model of transcription dynamics during early embryonic nuclear cycles in Drosophila . ( A ) Depiction of a piece - wise linear approximation to average measured ﬂuorescence of loci as a function of time during nuclear cycle 12 . In step ( 1 ) , RNAP molecules are loaded on to the gene at an average constant rate , 𝑅 . After the ﬁrst RNAP terminates transcription at time Δ 𝑡 𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 , initiation and termination balance each other out , leading to a constant ﬂuorescence value ( step ( 2 ) ) . In step ( 3 ) , initiation ends , causing the observed ﬂuorescence to monotonically decrease . ( B ) Schematic of the RNAP loading behavior at each step in ( A ) . step ( 3 ) , leading to a decrease in ﬂuorescence as elongating polymerases ﬁnish transcribing . Note 945 that this step is not accounted for in any analyses or models in this study . 946 Given this model , the maximum ﬂuorescence observed in a trace is given by 947 𝑓 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ≈ 𝛼 ⋅ 𝑅 ⋅ Δ 𝑡 𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 , ( S11 ) , where 𝑅 is the loading deﬁned in Equation 2 , and 𝛼 is the instantaneous ﬂuorescence per mRNA 948 molecule that we estimate in Section S1 . 3 . As a result , the maximum ﬂuorescence is proportional 949 to the loading rate , namely 950 𝑓 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ∝ 𝛼 ⋅ 𝑅 . ( S12 ) Thus , we now have an expression for 𝑓 𝑚𝑎𝑥 that enables us to relate our measurements to the 951 thermodynamic model’s prediction for 𝑅 , the RNAP loading rate ( Fig . 2E ) . 952 S1 . 3 MS2 Calibration 953 To estimate the ﬂuorescence detection threshold in our system , we calibrated the MCP - mCherry 954 signal to single molecule ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ( smFISH ) data from Garcia et al . ( 2013 ) . 955 This calibration is based on the fact that , to produce one mRNA molecule , RNAP has to spend a 956 deﬁned amount of time on the reporter thus contributing to the integrated spot ﬂuorescence . We 957 deﬁne 𝛼 as the ﬂuorescence of one RNAP molecule bearing a labeled nascent RNA and Δ 𝑡 𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 as 958 the time RNAP spends on the reporter gene to synthesize one mRNA molecule ( Fig . S2A ) . Then , the 959 integrated spot ﬂuorescence corresponding to the production of one mRNA molecule , 𝛽 , is 960 𝛽 ( 𝑎 . 𝑢 . × 𝑚𝑖𝑛 × 𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑒 −1 ) = 𝛼 ( 𝑎 . 𝑢 . × 𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑒 −1 ) × Δ 𝑡 𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ( 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ) . ( S13 ) From the deﬁnition of 𝛽 above , it follows that the integrated ﬂuorescence of a spot over time 961 corresponds to the total number of mRNA molecules produced by that locus in that period ( Fig . S2A ) . 962 Using smFISH , Garcia et al . ( 2013 ) measured the mean number of mRNA molecules produced per 963 nucleus by a P2P - MS2 reporter transgene during nuclear cycle 13 as a function of anterior - posterior 964 position ( Fig . S2B ) . To compare these data with the measurements obtained from our imaging 965 30 of 41 setup , we imaged the same reporter using 2x Dorsal ﬂies and calculated the mean integrated spot 966 ﬂuorescence across all nuclei as a function of position along the anterior - posterior axis ( Fig . S2B ) . We 967 plotted these two measurements against each other and ﬁtted the data to a line going through the 968 origin ( Fig . S2C ) . The slope of this line indicates 𝛽 , the integrated spot ﬂuorescence corresponding 969 to a single produced mRNA molecule . 970 With this ﬂuorescence calibration factor in hand , we can now estimate 𝛼 , the spot ﬂuorescence 971 corresponding to a single RNAP molecule attached to one nascent mRNA molecule with 24 MS2 972 loops . We can estimate Δ 𝑡 𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 by invoking the elongation rate of RNAP in the ﬂy embryo , 𝑣 𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛 , 973 and the length of our reporter , 𝐿 , such that 974 Δ 𝑡 𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝐿 𝑣 𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛 . ( S14 ) Using this expression for Δ 𝑡 𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 , we can solve for 𝛼 in Equation S13 to obtain the ﬂuorescence of 975 a single RNAP molecule given by 976 𝛼 = 𝛽 × 𝑣 𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛 𝐿 . ( S15 ) We next replace 𝐿 by the length of our reporter transgene , 5 . 2 kbp . In addition we replace 𝑣 𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛 by a 977 previously experimentally measured value of 1 . 5 ± 0 . 14 kbp / min ( Garcia et al . , 2013 ) , and 𝛽 by the 978 calibration factor shown in Figure S2C . We then arrive at 979 𝛼 = 30 . 3 𝑎 . 𝑢 . ⋅ 𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑅𝑁𝐴𝑃 × 1 . 5 𝑘𝑏𝑝 𝑚𝑖𝑛 5 . 2 𝑘𝑏𝑝 = 8 . 837 a . u . per molecule . ( S16 ) Note that 𝑣 𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛 and 𝛽 have an associated error that leads to uncertainty in the calculation of 𝛼 . 980 Propagating these errors results in an uncertainty of 0 . 046 a . u . per RNAP , or approximately 14 % . 981 This uncertainty should be viewed as an underestimate since , for example , we are not accounting 982 for embryo - to - embryo variability in the accumulated mRNA measured by microscopy or smFISH . 983 Using this calibration factor , we can now determine the detection threshold of our experimental 984 setup in terms of absolute number of RNAP molecules . One way of determining this threshold is by 985 comparing the mean ﬂuorescence of the dimmest spots with the magnitude of their corresponding 986 background ﬂuctuations . If these values overlap , then it is not possible to determine with certainty 987 whether a spot correspond to actual signal or to background . This approach reveals a detection 988 threshold of ≈ 80 a . u . or ≈ 9 RNAP molecules ( Fig . S2D ) . A second strategy to determining the 989 detection threshold is looking at the ﬂuorescence of the dimmest detected spots . Their average 990 ﬂuorescence indicates the value under which no reliable detection is possible . This analysis reveals 991 a detection limit of ≈ 54 a . u . or ≈ 6 RNAP molecules ( Fig . S2E ) . These values for our detection limit 992 using MCP - mCherry are on the order of twice the limit determined for similar experiments that 993 used MCP - eGFP or PCP - eGFP ( Garcia et al . , 2013 ; Alamos et al . , 2020 ) , most likely due to mCherry 994 being a dimmer ﬂuorophore than eGFP ( Lambert , 2019 ) . 995 Finally , in the main text ( Section 2 . 5 ) , we estimated the maximum ﬂuorescence corresponding to 996 the basal level of RNAP molecules on our reporter constructs ( Section 2 . 5 ) . We include here details 997 of the calculation . Since the length of the coding region of our reporter constructs is 5 . 2 kbp , and 998 the footprint of RNA Polymerase II is 40 bp ( Selby et al . , 1997 ) , 130 RNAPs can ﬁt on the gene at any 999 given time . Since we estimate the maximum ﬂuorescence corresponding to basal transcription to 1000 be ≈ 20 RNAP molecules ( Section 2 . 5 ) , the reporter is 20 / 130 ≈ 15 % saturated by RNAPs . 1001 31 of 41 promoter MS2 lacZ 3’UTR RNAP RNAP position spot fluorescence v elon Δt elongation α time s po t f l uo r e sc en c e i n t en s i t y Δt elongation α • β = 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 0 2 4 6 8 0 50 100 150 200 250 ×10 3 position along the anterior - posterior axis ( % embryo length ) A C 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ln ( fluorescence ) ( a . u . ) 0 0 . 04 0 . 08 0 . 12 0 . 16 p r obab ili t y ln ( number of RNAP molecules ) - 1 0 1 2 3 4 error ( background fluctuations ) mean trace fluorescence ~ 9 RNAP 0 100 200 300 0 0 . 005 0 . 01 0 . 015 p r obab ili t y 0 10 20 30 number of RNAP molecules spot fluorescence ( a . u . ) ~ 6 RNAP D minimum fluorescence per trace Gamma distribution fit p r odu c ed m RN A ( f l uo r e sc en c e a . u . × m i n ) number of mRNA ( smFISH ) R 2 = 0 . 85 β 0 50 100 150 200 250 1 9 7 5 3 x10 3 B ~ 54 a . u . ~ 80 a . u .

( D ) Histograms of mean trace ﬂuorescence in all particles across all experiments and the error in the ﬂuorescence of these particles as reported by ﬂuctuations in the ﬂuorescence background . Because the spot ﬂuorescence was obtained by integrating over three slices , the corresponding error was propagated by multiplying the error from one slice ( using the method described in ( Garcia et al . , 2013 ) ) by √ 3 . The dashed line indicates the center of where the two distributions overlap , suggesting a detection limit of approximately 9 RNAP molecules .

A best ﬁt to a Gamma distribution is shown in red for ease of visualization . 32 of 41 S1 . 4 Measuring transcriptional onset times 1002 We measured the time at which each locus turns on by determining the ﬁrst time point where a spot 1003 was detected . To make this possible , we needed a reliable way to estimate t = 0 which corresponded 1004 to the beginning of the nuclear cycle . 1005 Typically , ﬂuorescently labeled histone is used to determine the timing of anaphase ( Garcia 1006 et al . , 2013 ) . However , only a small fraction of our embryos had measurable levels of visible 1007 Histone - iRFP , most likely due to embryo - to - embryo variability and the low density of DNA in the 1008 nucleus in nuclear cycle 12 ( compared to later nuclear cycles when His - iRFP is more visible ) . When 1009 the Histone - iRFP signal was insuﬃcient to determine anaphase , we relied on the Dorsal - mVenus 1010 channel . As we describe below , just like Histone - iRFP , the nuclear Dorsal ﬂuorescence also shows a 1011 characteristic pattern during mitosis . 1012 To precisely determine which features of the Dorsal - mVenus channel to use for mitosis timing , 1013 we imaged Dorsal - mVenus and Histone - RFP—which , as opposed to Histone - iRFP , can be consistently 1014 detected—simultaneously ( Fig . S3 ) . This exercise showed that the edges of nuclei become less well 1015 deﬁned as they enter mitosis and then elongate at the beginning of anaphase ( Fig . S3 ) . In this way , 1016 we could identify precise anaphase frames in movies with no visible Histone - iRFP . Despite using this 1017 method , we still estimate that there may be a 2 - 3 frame error ( i . e . 20 - 30 s ) in our determination of 1018 anaphase . Thus , this error is < 20 % of the measured period of transcriptional activity within nuclear 1019 cycle 12 ( ∼ 3 min ) . 1020 Dorsal - mVenus 20μm His - RFP Dorsal - mVenus His - RFP 10μm . . . . . .

S1 . 5 Kinetic barrier ﬁts with a diﬀerent functional form of the transition rate 𝑘 1021 In the main text , we hypothesize that the transition rate between OFF states and between the last 1022 OFF state and the ON state is proportional to Dorsal occupancy ( Eqn . 1 ) . Here , we show that another 1023 functional form for 𝑘 in the kinetic barrier model can only partially recapitulate the fraction of active 1024 loci and transcriptional onset times for each of our enhancers . This functional form is motivated 1025 by the idea that Dorsal could catalyze a change in the promoter ( e . g . opening of chromatin ) in 1026 a manner dependent on the speed of its ﬁrst occurrence of binding rather than its equilibrium 1027 occupancy . Speciﬁcally , inspired by ( Eck et al . , 2020 ) , we posit that 1028 𝑘 = 𝑐 ⋅ [ 𝐷𝑙 ] . ( S17 ) 33 of 41 In this alternate model , we assume that the Dorsal binding site aﬃnity dependence is wrapped 1029 up into the 𝑐 parameter . Thus , we ﬁt each enhancer using a distinct value of 𝑐 . As can be seen in 1030 Figure S4 , this alternate model cannot ﬁt the data as well as when 𝑘 is assumed to be proportional 1031 to the Dorsal occupancy as described in the main text and in Figure 5 . Speciﬁcally , this functional 1032 form is less capable of recapitulating the saturation plateau of the fraction of active loci at high 1033 Dorsal concentrations . 1034 0 2 4 0 0 . 5 1 0 5 0 0 . 5 1 0 5 0 0 . 5 1 0 5 0 0 . 5 1 0 5 0 0 . 5 1 0 5 0 0 . 5 1 0 5 0 0 . 5 1 0 5 f r a c t i on o f a c t i v e nu c l e i f r a c t i on o f a c t i v e l o c i f r a c t i on o f a c t i v e l o c i f r a c t i on o f a c t i v e l o c i f r a c t i on o f a c t i v e l o c i f r a c t i on o f a c t i v e l o c i f r a c t i on o f a c t i v e l o c i DBS _ 6 . 23 DBS _ 5 . 81 DBS _ 5 . 39 DBS _ 5 . 13 DBS _ 4 . 80 DBS _ 4 . 73 DBS _ 4 . 29 t r an sc r i p t i on on s e t t i m e ( m i n ) t r an sc r i p t i on on s e t t i m e ( m i n ) 0 2 4 0 2 4 0 2 4 0 2 4 0 2 4 0 2 4 t r an sc r i p t i on on s e t t i m e ( m i n ) t r an sc r i p t i on on s e t t i m e ( m i n ) t r an sc r i p t i on on s e t t i m e ( m i n ) t r an sc r i p t i on on s e t t i m e ( m i n ) t r an sc r i p t i on on s e t t i m e ( m i n ) Dorsal concentration ( x10 3 a . u . ) Dorsal concentration ( x10 3 a . u . ) Dorsal concentration ( x10 3 a . u . ) Figure S4 .

Measuring Dorsal - mVenus nuclear ﬂuorescence across the dorsoventral axis . ( A ) In each frame , the Dorsal - mVenus ﬂuorescence is measured in each z - slice across nuclei . This creates a series of ﬂuorescence values as a function of z - slice ( ﬁlled circles ) . z - slices at the top and the bottom correspond to cytoplasmic ﬂuorescence . Thus , in ventral nuclei , the brightest slice is the z - slice corresponding to the best estimate of the true nuclear ﬂuorescence ( magenta circles ) . On the other hand , dorsal nuclei have a lower Dorsal concentration than the cytoplasm , so the darkest slice is a better estimate of the true Dorsal concentration ( blue circles ) . In lateral nuclei , the nuclear ﬂuorescence is similar to that of the cytoplasm ( green circles ) . To identify which z - slice to use for nuclear ﬂuorescence calculations , we ﬁt the ﬂuorescence , 𝑓 , over z - slices , 𝑧 , to a quadratic equation , 𝑓 = 𝑎𝑧 2 + 𝑏𝑧 , where 𝑎 and 𝑏 are the coeﬃcients of this quadratic equation . Then , we use the value of 𝑎 to determine whether the nucleus is ventral ( 𝑎 < - 0 . 5 ) , lateral ( - 0 . 5 𝑎 < 0 . 5 ) , or dorsal ( 𝑎 > 0 . 5 ) . Next , in ventral nuclei , we take the brightest z - slice as the Dorsal - mVenus ﬂuorescence of that frame ( dashed horizontal magenta line ) . In lateral nuclei , we take the median of ﬂuorescence values over z - slices ( dashed horizontal green line ) . In dorsal nuclei , we take the darkest z - slice as the respective frame’s Dorsal - mVenus ﬂuorescence ( dashed horizontal blue line ) . ( B ) Representative time traces of nuclear Dorsal - mVenus ﬂuorescence . To calculate transcriptional activity as a function of Dorsal protein , we sort nuclei into Dorsal concentration bins based on the the Dorsal - mVenus ﬂuorescence at a single ﬁducial time point halfway through the respective lifetime of each nucleus . 35 of 41 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 AP position ( x / L ) 0 100 200 300 400 V enu s - B c d f l uo r e sc en c e ( a . u . ) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 e G F P - B c d c on c en t r a t i on ( n M ) Dl - mVenus CRISPR knock - in + Dl - mVenus transgene Dl - mVenus CRISPR knock - in 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 time since anaphase ( min ) 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 nu c l ea r D l c on c en t r a t i on ( a . u . ) ×10 3 B nu c l ea r D l c on c en t r a t i on ( n M ho m od i m e r s ) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 eGFP - Bcd concentration ( nM ) V enu s - B c d f l uo r e sc en c e ( a . u . ) A Gregor 2007 dataset 1 Gregor 2007 dataset 2 α = 4±0 . 43 ( a . u . / nM ) Venus - Bcd ventral - most dorsal - most C 0 40 80 120 160 0 100 200 300 400 Figure S6 .

( A ) Three embryos derived from yw ; Venus - Bicoid ; BcdE1 homozygous mothers were imaged in nuclear cycle 14 using the imaging conditions of our MS2 experiments . The nuclear ﬂuorescence was calculated 15 min into nuclear cycle 14 for cross - comparison with absolute eGFP - Bicoid concentration measurements from Figure 2B of Gregor et al . ( 2007 ) . We compare the ﬂuorescence values of Venus - Bicoid to the absolute concentration of eGFP - Bicoid along the anterior - posterior axis of the embryo .

Each data point corresponds to the mean ± standard deviation of the ﬂuorescence of all nuclei belonging to the same 1 % spatial window along the anterior - posterior axis . These data were compared to two diﬀerent absolute measurements of eGFP - Bicoid , shown in red and blue .

For the DBS _ 6 . 23 reporter construct , we imaged embryos laid by two diﬀerent mothers . 1x mothers ( red ) carry dl 1 ( a null Dorsal allele ) and a Dorsal - mVenus transgene created by Reeves et al . ( 2012 ) . 2x mothers ( blue ) carry a Dorsal - mVenus CRISPR knock - in and the aforementioned Dorsal - mVenus transgene . Nuclei from these diﬀerent mothers were binned according to their mVenus ﬂuorescence and diﬀerent activity metrics were measured for each bin . The two Dorsal - mVenus populations are not diﬀerent within error such that it is valid to treat embryos laid by these diﬀerent mothers as equivalent .
