Three yeast actin - binding proteins were identified using yeast actin filaments as an affinity ma - trix . One protein appears to be a yeast myosin heavy chain ; it is dissociated from actin filaments by ATP , it is similar in size ( 200 kD ) to other myosins , and anti - bodies directed against Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain bind to it . Immunofluorescence experiments show that a second actin - binding protein ( 67 kD ) co - localizes in vivo with both cytoplasmic actin cables and cortical actin patches , the only identifiable actin structures in yeast . The cortical actin patches are con - centrated at growing surfaces of the yeast cell where they might play a role in membrane and cell wall in - sertion , and the third actin - binding protein ( 85 kD ) is only detected in association with these structures . This 85 - kD protein is therefore a candidate for a deter - minant of growth sites . The in vivo role of this protein was tested by overproduction ; this overproduction causes a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton which in turn dramatically affects the budding pattern and spatial growth organization of the yeast cell . S CCHAROMYCE $ CEREVISIAE cells grow asymmetri - cally ; new cells form as buds on mother cells . Thus , a growing yeast cell faces several problems of spatial or - ganization . First , a bud site must be chosen on the surface of the unbudded yeast cell . Once this growth axis is estab - lished , transport of organelles and materials synthesized in the mother cell must be directed along the axis to the growing bud , and growth must be restricted to the bud . The actin cytoskeleton has been implicated , by its organization and by mutant phenotypes , as a key determinant of axis formation and growth organization in yeast . The disposition of actin within the yeast cell reflects the asymmetry of growth . When visualized by fluorescence mi - croscopy ( Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ; Adams and Pringle , 1984 ) , the actin in mother cells is seen as filamentous cables , while the actin in buds appears as cortical patches . Replace - merit of the single yeast actin gene ( Ng and Abelson , 1980 ; Gallwitz and Seidel , 1980 ) with a mutant actin gene ( Shortle et al . , 1984 ) results in loss of normal actin organization , and in multiple bud morphogenesis defects ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ) . At nonpermissive temperatures , 70 % of cells carry - ing the actl - 1 mutation accumulate in an unbudded state . At the same time , secretion , normally targeted to the growing bud , is defective , and vesicles accumulate : Furthermore , chitin , which in wild - type cells is deposited in a ring at the base of the bud , becomes aberrantly localized . The site of bud emergence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells is not randomly chosen . In haploid yeast , buds emerge D .

Actin might play a role in de - termining the bud emergence site . Early in the cell cycle cor - tical actin patches form a ring on the cortex of the unbudded yeast cell . This ring is an indicator of the precise site of bud emergence . The ring of actin patches also directly underlies the ring of chitin that forms around the bud neck ( Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ) . Actin organization in yeast suggests how the actin cyto - skeleton might function in morphogenesis ( Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ; Adams and Pringle , 1984 ) . Actin cables gen - erally are aligned along the axis of bud growth . These actin cables might mediate transport of membrane - bound vesicles from mother cells to growing buds . As mentioned above , vesicles accumulate in actin mutants . Actin - mediated organ - elle transport has been observed in other organisms ( Kachar and Reese , 1988 ; Kohno and Shimmen , 1988 ; Adams and Pollard , 1986 ) . In addition , cortical actin patches are con - centrated in regions actively involved in cell surface growth in yeasts ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ; Marks et al . , 1986 ) . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae these cortical patches are concentrated in the bud , which grows by insertion of plasma membrane and cell wall mate - rial at its tip ( Field and Schekman , 1980 ; Tkacz and Lam - pen , 1972 ; Cabib , 1975 ) , and the patches rearrange to a different region of surface growth , the region of septum for - mation , at cytokinesis . Thus , the cortical actin structures are well placed to be involved in membrane and cell wall inser - tion at growth sites .

The yeast actin polypeptide , though , is not likely to contain all of the information that specifies the spatial organi - zation and timing of actin filament assembly . First , yeast ac - tin and animal muscle actins are ' ~ 85 % identical in amino acid sequence , yet yeast actin is quite different in organiza - tion and function from animal muscle actin . Furthermore , the single yeast actin polypeptide assembles into two differ - ent structures in yeast : cortical structures and cytoplasmic cables . We therefore suppose that the organization of the yeast actin cytoskeleton is largely specified by actin - binding proteins . Yeast actin - binding proteins could , by virtue of their ability to organize the actin cytoskeleton , actually orga - nize the spatial pattern of yeast growth . Further understanding of how the actin cytoskeleton func - tions to organize the spatial pattern of yeast cell growth re - quires identification of the yeast proteins that interact with actin . Recently a method using phalloidin - stabilized actin filament affinity chromatography to identify actin - binding proteins was described by Miller , K . G . , and B . M . Alberts ( manuscript submitted for publication ) . We report here the use of this method to identify three yeast actin - binding pro - teins by virtue of their affinity for yeast actin filaments . One 200 - kD protein appears to be a yeast myosin , a type of pro - tein already known to interact with actin in vivo . Immu - nofluorescence experiments using affinity - purified antisera demonstrate that the two other actin - binding proteins interact with actin in yeast cells . A 67 - kD yeast actin - binding protein associates in vivo with both actin cables and cortical actin patches . An 85 - kD yeast actin - binding protein is a candidate for a protein that can organize actin at growing yeast sur - faces , and as a result , can determine the yeast growth pat - tern ; it interacts exclusively with the cortical actin structures found in actively growing regions of yeast cells . Overexpres - sion of the gene encoding this 85 - kD protein results in re - arrangement of the actin cytoskeleton , an altered spatial growth pattern , and failure to choose the proper site of bud emergence .

This SACI allele has a 2 . 6 - kb Barn HI - Barn HI fragment deleted . This work will be described by Novick et al . , 1988 . pRB393 contains the SACI gene ( Novick et al . , 1988 ) cloned on YEp24 ( Botstein et al . , 1979 ) . Materials and Methods Yeast Strains and Genetic Techniques The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I . The strain DBY - 877 was used for most biochemical work . For the particular experiment shown in Fig . 1 , DBY877 - derived strains with altered SACI ( SACI was iso - lated as a suppressor of an actin mutant ; Novick et al . , 1988 ) gene dosage were used ( see Table I ) , however , direct comparisons showed that identical results are obtained when DBY877 is used ( not shown ) . Standard genetic techniques of crossing , sporulation , and tetrad analysis were as described by Sherman et al . ( 1974 ) . YEPD medium contains 1 % yeast extract , 2 % bactopeptone , and 2 % glucose . Synthetic medium , plus required supplements , was prepared as described by Sherman et al . ( 1974 ) . Solid media contain 2 % agar . Isolation and Analysis of Yeast Actin - binding Proteins Yeast cells were disrupted using a Bead - Beater homogenizer ( Biospec Prod - ucts , Bartlesville , OK ) . All cell lysates were prepared in buffer supplement - ed immediately before lysis with a 10 - 3 dilution of aqueous protease inhib - itor cocktail ( 1 , 000× = 0 . 5 mg / ml of the following dissolved in water : antipain , leupeptin , pepstatin A , chymostatin , and aprotinin ) and a 10 - 2 dilution of ethanol protease inhibitor cocktail ( 100× = an ethanol solution containing 0 . 1 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 mM benzamidine HCI , and 0 . 1 mg / ml phenanthroline ) . Concentrated protease inhibitor cocktails were stored at - 20°C . For column buffers , the aqueous cocktail was used at 0 . 1 x and the ethanol cocktail was omitted . To maximize phenylmetbylsul - fonyl fluoride action , dithiothreitol was not added to lysates until 15 - 30 rain after cell lysis . Yeast actin for affinity columns was prepared by the Zechel ( 1980 ) DNase 1 affinity - purification procedure that was originally applied for yeast by Kil - martin and Adams ( 1984 ) . The actin isolated in this manner appeared homo - geneous when visualized on Coomassie Blue - stained SDS gels as was seen by Kilmartin and Adams ( 1984 ) , except for a very faint 70 - kD polypeptide occasionally seen on overloaded gels . DNasel was obtained from Boehr - inger Mannheim Biochemicals ( Indianapolis , IN ) . For large scale prepara - tions actin was isolated from fresh wet blocks of commercial Red Star baker ' s yeast ( Universal Foods , Randolf , MA ) . 0 . 5 - ml columns containing 0 . 4 mg of phalloidin - stabilized yeast actin filaments , or 0 . 4 mg of BSA , were constructed by coupling a solution of 2 mg / ml F - actin with 5 p , g / ml phalloidin or a solution of 3 mg / ml BSA ( a higher BSA concentration was used because the coupling efficiency was lower ) in coupling buffer ( 50 mM Hepes , pH Z5 , 0 . 2 mM ATE 0 . 2 mM CaC12 , 0 . 1 M KCI , 6 . 0 mM MgClz ) to a 1 : 1 mixture of Afli - Gel 10 ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Richmond , CA ) and Sepharose CL - 6B ( an inert resin that improved column flow properties ; Pharmacia , Inc . , Piscataway , NJ ) . The construction and use of F - actin columns was as described at length by Miller et al . ( 1985 ) wbo have shown that these columns can be used to isolate many well - characterized actin - binding proteins from lysates prepared from a vari - ety of cell types . Initially , the yeast actin filaments , formed in vitro for use on affinity columns , were shown by electron microscopy to be of the correct size ( 7 nm diam ) and structure . Subsequently , actin filament formation and phalloidin stabilization were monitored before column construction by fluor - escence microscopy visualization of filaments labeled with a molar excess of rhodamine phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Inc . , Eugene , OR ) . To identify yeast actin - binding proteins , yeast for each column were grown in 1 liter YEPD to " ~ 5 x 106 cells per milliliter . The cells were col - lected by centrifugation and washed twice in wash buffer ( 5 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM Na3 EDTA , 20 mM KCI ) . The cells from each l - liter culture were disrupted in 40 ml of lysis buffer ( 5 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM Na3 EDTA , 20 mM KCI , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol ) , minus dithiothrei - tol and supplemented with protease inhibitors ( see above ) . Disruption involved three l - min homogenizations in an ice - jacketed Bead - Beater ho - mogenizer ( Biospec Products ) , allowing several minutes between homoge - nizations for cooling . After 15 - 30 min on ice , the lysate was made 0 . 5 mM in dithiothreitol . After sedimentation at 60 , 000 g for 60 min , lysates were loaded in paral - lel over actin filament and BSA columns at (cid:127)3 ml / h . The columns were washed with 10 - 20 - column volumes of lysis buffer , then eluted stepwise at 6 ml / h with lysis buffer containing first 0 . 5 mM ATP , 3 mM MgCI2 , then 0 . 1 M KCI , and finally , 0 . 5 M KCI . 10 - column volumes were pooled for each elution condition . To analyze eluted proteins , one - fourth volume 50 % trichloroacetic acid , 2 mg / ml sodium deoxycholate , was added to each pooled aliquot .

Only cells with two or more scars were scored . Focusing up and down with the microscope was important because adjacent scars often were in different focal planes . ~ : Number of cells with scars scored as bipolar / total number of ceils scored ( % of cells with bipolar scars ) . resulting precipitate was washed once with 10 % trichloroacetic acid , and twice with acetone . Each precipitate was dissolved in SDS - polyacrylamide gel sample buffer , and one - fourth of each sample was loaded onto an 8 . 5 % polyacrylamide gel ( Laemmli , 1970 ) . Proteins were visualized by Coomas - sie Blue staining or using a silver staining kit ( Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp . , Westbury , NY ) . Preparation of Antisera To obtain sufficient amounts of actin - binding proteins to generate antisera , 200 ml lysates were prepared from 6 - liter haploid yeast cultures grown to 2 × l07 cells per milliliter . The lysates were passed first through a 10 - ml column containing l0 mg BSA to remove nonspecific proteins , then over a 2 - ml column containing 1 . 5 nag of yeast actin filaments . Actin - binding pro - teins were collected as above , but no concentration step was necessary to observe eluted proteins on Coomasie Blue - stained gels . Yeast actin and the 67 - and 85 - kD actin - binding proteins were excised from preparative SDS - polyacrylamide gels and the gel slices were equili - brated in PBS ( 0 . 13 M NaCl , 2 mM KCI , 8 mM Na2HPO4 , 2 mM KH2PO4 , pH 7 . 2 ) . The slices were crushed , mixed with PBS , then 2 vol of Freund ' s complete ( first two injections ) or incomplete ( all subsequent injec - tions ) adjuvant were added , and the samples were homogenized . Rabbits were immunized with about 50 I . tg ofactin , or 10 - 20 Ixg of the actin - binding proteins , and were boosted with similar amounts of protein at days 20 and 35 . At day 47 rabbits were test bled . Antisera were tested by immunoblot - ting , using nitrocellulose strips that contained total yeast cell lysates , or column fractions enriched for actin - binding proteins , that had been trans - ferred from SDS - polyacrylamide gels ( Burnette , 1981 ) . One out of three rabbits immunized with yeast actin , and two out of two rabbits immunized with either the 67 - or the 85 - kD actin - binding proteins tested positive . An - tisera were affinity purified and stored as described by Pfeffer et al . ( 1983 ) , and specificity was evaluated by immunoblotting ( see Fig . 2 ) . The Dic - tyostelium myosin antiserum ( Berlot et al . , 1985 ) was a generous gift of Kent Matlack and Catherine Berlot ( Stanford University , Stanford , CA ) . lmmunofluorescence and Calcofluor Staining Yeast were grown to early log phase : generally 2 × 106 ceils per milliliter . Fixation and immunofluorescence procedures were adapted from Kilmartin and Adams ( 1984 ) . Best results were obtained when cells were grown in syn - thetic medium and fixed by adding 0 . 67 ml of 37 % formaldehyde directly to a 5 - ml culture . After 60 min at room temperature , the cells were washed twice with 2 ml 1 . 2 M sorbitol , 0 . 1 M potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 5 . To re - move cell walls , the fixed cells were resuspended in 0 . 5 ml of the same buffer , then 1 lal I ~ - mercaptoethanol and I0 ltl of I mg / ml zymolyase 60 , 000 , were added . After 30 min at 37°C , 15 Ixl of the cell suspension was trans - ferred to a polylysine - coated well on a multiwell slide . After 60 s , the sus - pension was removed by aspiration , and the slide was immersed in - 20°C methanol for 6 min , and - 20°C acetone for 30 s . ( This step was essential for actin immunofluorescence , both using fixed yeast cells and actin fila - ments assembled from pure actin in vitro . ) After air drying the slide briefly , the cells were rehydrated with PBS containing 1 mg / ml BSA ( PBS - BSA ) . All antisera were diluted in PBS - BSA . Antibody incubations were 60 - min each , followed by five PBS - BSA washes . Slides were mounted in 90 % glycerol containing p - phenylenediamine as described by Kilmartin and Adams ( 1984 ) . The afffinity - purified antisera against yeast actin , and the 67 - and 85 - kD actin - binding proteins were used for immunofluorescence at 1 : 50 , 1 : 40 , and 1 : 40 dilutions , respectively . The afffinity - purified rat anti - yeast actin antise - rum ( a generous gift of Dr . John Kilmartin , Medical Research Council Labo - ratory of Molecular Biology , Cambridge , England ) was used in double - label experiments at 1 : 30 . Fluorescein - and rhodamine - conjugated anti - heavy and - light chain secondary antisera were obtained from Organon Teknika - Cappel ( Malvern , PA ) . For double - label experiments it is essential that the fluorochrome - conju - gated secondary antisera show absolute species specificity for the primary antisera used in the experiment . In control experiments , the rhodamine - con - jugated anti - rat antiserum showed no reactivity with rabbit primary antisera . However , the fluorescein - conjugated anti - rabbit antiserum reacted with rat primary antisera . To remove the rat - reactive component , the antiserum was absorbd against resin containing immobilized rat IgG ( Organon Teknika - Cappel ) . Control experiments demonstrated that the rat - reactive component was entirely removed . To label chitin , fixed and washed cells were incubated in 0 . 1 % calcofluor ( fluorescent brightener 28 ; Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) in water for 10 min , then washed , and resuspended in water . Figure 2 . Specificity of affinity - puri - fied antisera . Anti - yeast actin ( A ) , anti - 67 - kD actin - binding protein , and anti - 85 - kD actin - binding protein anti - sera were used at 1 : 200 , 1 : 50 , and 1 : 100 , respectively , to probe immuno - blots containing , - o5 I . tg each of total yeast cell lysates . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 107 , 1988 2554 Results Identification of Yeast Actin - binding Proteins Columns constructed from phalloidin - stabilized rabbit mus - cle actin filaments have been used previously to isolate both well - known and previously unidentified actin - binding pro - teins from both mammalian and nonmammalian cell lysates ( Miller , K . G . , and B . M . Alberts , manuscript submitted for publication ) . In the present study we used yeast actin fila - ments to identify yeast actin - binding proteins . Yeast cell ly - sates , prepared in a low ionic strength buffer that favors dis - assembly of actin filaments , were passed over columns containing yeast actin filaments stabilized with phalloidin , and actin - binding proteins were dissociated first with Mg + + - ATP , and then with steps of 0 . 1 M KC1 and 0 . 5 M KCI . At each step , a specific protein was found : Mg + + - ATP , 0 . 1 M KC1 , and 0 . 5 M KCI eluted proteins of 200 , 67 , and 85 kD , respectively . For the experiment shown in Fig . 1 A , independent lysates from two different yeast strains were passed in parallel over two actin filament columns and one BSA control column . The first four gel lanes show cell lysate fractions for compar - ison with lanes containing affinity - purified actin - binding proteins , and the fifth lane contains molecular mass stan - dards . The next three lanes show that little protein is detected with Coomassie Blue when Mg + + - ATP is used to dissociate proteins from the two yeast F - actin columns and the BSA control column , except for some actin that leaches off the ac - tin columns ( actin leaches off the columns continuously , be - ginning with the washes preceding the application of ex - tracts ) . However , silver staining reveals many proteins eluted by Mg÷ + - ATP ( Fig . 1 B ) . Proteins of 200 and 160 kD elute from actin columns but not from BSA control columns . Other differences between proteins eluted from actin and BSA columns seen in Fig . 1 B were not found to be reproduc - ible . The presence of the 160 - kD protein in the ATP eluate was somewhat variable ; this protein could be a proteolytic product of the 200 - kD protein . The 200 - kD protein has the size of a myosin heavy chain and , characteristic of myosins , is dissociated from actin fila - ments by ATP . Significantly , a Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain antibody binds to this protein in immunoblotting ex - periments ( Fig . 1 C ) , suggesting that it is a yeast myosin heavy chain . No light chain candidates were identified . The remaining six lanes in Fig . 1 A show proteins of 67 and 85 kD that are reproducibly dissociated from F - actin , but not BSA columns , by 0 . 1 M KC1 and 0 . 5 M KCI , respec - tively ( higher salt concentrations do not result in the release of additional actin - binding proteins , nor does boiling the resin in SDS ) . These two proteins do not correspond to any major proteins present in the cell lysate fractions ; in fact , we believe each represents ~ 0 . 01 % of soluble protein ( data not shown ) , so that they are each enriched in one affinity - purification step , ~ 5 , 000 - fold to ' ~ 50 % purity . Immunoblot - ting experiments using the affinity - purified antisera described in the next section , indicated that passage of cell lysates over yeast actin columns results in near quantitative binding of the 85 - kD actin - binding protein , and ~ 50 % binding of the 67 - kD actin - binding protein ( not shown ) . When rabbit actin fila - ments were used as an affinity matrix instead of yeast actin filaments , the 85 - and the 200 - kD actin - binding proteins were isolated , but the 67 - kD actin - binding protein was not ( not shown ) , despite the fact that rabbit muscle actin is 85 % identical in amino acid sequence to yeast actin . In Vivo Localization of Yeast Actin - binding Proteins The 85 - and the 67 - kD actin - binding proteins were localized in vivo by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy . To do this , polyclonal antisera were raised against these actin - bind - ing proteins and yeast actin , and the resulting antisera were affinity purified . The specificity of these affinity - purified an - tisera , when used to probe immunoblot strips containing total yeast cell lysates , is shown in Fig . 2 . For the immuno - fluorecence experiments described below , it is important to note that the antisera against the actin - binding proteins do not cross react with actin . These affinity - purified antisera were used to look for cross - reacting proteins in lysates pre - pared from Dictyostelium , Acanthamoeba , and a variety of vertebrate cells . The only proteins detected in these experi - ments were polypeptides of ' ~ 124 and 129 kD in Dic - tyostelium and Acanthamoeba , respectively , detected with the antiserum against the 85 - kD yeast actin - binding protein ( not shown ) . Subsequent experiments showed that this anti - serum does not react with either of two known actin - binding proteins of similar electrophoretic mobility found in Dic - tyostelium and Acanthamoeba ; no reaction was observed with Acanthamoeba myosin I isotypes A and B ( C6t6 et al . , 1985 ; kindly provided by Tom Lynch , National Institutes of Health ) or with the 120 - kD Dictyostelium actin - binding pro - tein ( Condeelis et al . , 1984 ; kindly provided by Anne Bres - nick , Albert Einstein College of Medicine , NY ) . Fig . 3 A shows yeast actin organization visualized by in - direct immunofluorescence microscopy using the affinity - purified yeast actin antiserum . As reported previously , actin cables , aligned along the yeast cell growth axis , and cortical actin patches , concentrated at growth sites ( particularly in buds ) , are observed . When the affinity - purified antiserum against the 67 - kD protein is used for indirect immunofluores - cence microscopy ( Fig . 3 B ) actin - like cables , aligned along the growth axis , and cortical patches , concentrated in buds , are seen . As shown in Fig . 3 C , the affinity - purified 85 - kD actin - binding protein antiserum detects actin - like cortical structures in growing bud regions of yeast cells , but even very long photographic exposures reveal no actin - like cable structures , despite the fact that the 85 - kD protein im - munofluorescence is brighter than the 67 - kD protein im - munofluorescence ( the mother cells are not visible in Fig . 3 C , the staining is restricted largely to buds ) . The im - munofluorescent images in Fig . 3 , A - C suggest that both the 85 - and the 67 - kD proteins associate with actin in vivo . Fur - ther support for this conclusion comes from the two experi - ments discussed below . A double - label immunofluorescence experiment is shown in Fig . 4 . The left panels ( Fig . 4 , A and C ) show anti - actin immunofluorescence using an affinity - purified rat antiserum ( Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ) and rhodamine - labeled sec - ondary antiserum . The right panels show anti - 67 - kD actin - binding protein ( Fig . 4 B ) and anti - 85 - kD actin - binding pro - tein ( Fig . 4 D ) immunofluorescence of the same cells shown in the corresponding left panels , using the affinity - purified rabbit antisera characterized in Fig . 2 , and a fluorescein - labeled secondary antiserum . Control experiments ( see Ma - terials and Methods ) demonstrated the specificity of the flu - orescein and rhodamine images for the appropriate primary Drubin et al .

Bar , 5 ~ tm . bars rather than arrays of actin cables , and cortical actin patches are less restricted to buds than is seen in wild - type cells ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ) . Anti - actin immunofluo - rescence of actl - 2 / actl - 2 cells is shown in Fig . 3 D ( the focal planes shown in Fig . 3 , D and F optimize visualization of the actin bars at the expense of the cortical actin patches ) . The anti - 67 - kD and anti - 85 - kD actin - binding protein immuno - fluorescence images of actl - 2 / actl - 2 cells are shown in Fig . 3 , E and F , respectively . The 67 - kD protein , which associates with patches and cables in wild - type cells , associates in the mutants with cortical actin patches found in buds and in mother cells , but not with the aberrant actin bars . The 85 - kD protein is associated with the cortical actin patches and with the heavy actin bars despite its apparent absence from nor - mal actin cables in wild - type cells . Consequences of 85 - kD Actin - binding Protein Overproduction The in vivo role of the 85 - kD actin - binding protein was tested by overproduction . This first required isolating the gene encoding this protein . The gene encoding the 85 - kD actin - binding protein ( designated ABPI ) was isolated by im - munoscreening a Lgtl 1 expression library ( a generous gift of R . Young , Massachusetts Institute of Technology ; Young and Davis , 1983 ) using the antiserum characterized in Fig . 2 . The cloning will be described in detail later ( Drubin , D . G . , Z . Zhu , and D . Botstein , manuscript in preparation ) . The identity of the clone was verified by demonstrating that in - troduction of a plasmid ( pRB1201 ) containing the cloned gene on a yeast episomal vector ( pRB307 ) into yeast , causes an approximately fivefold elevation in levels of the 85 - kD actin - binding protein , and by demonstration that expression of this protein in bacteria can be caused by transformation with pRB1201 ( Drubin , D . G . , Z . Zhu , and D . Botstein , manuscript in preparation ) . Overproduction of the 85 - kD protein is detrimental to yeast growth . The yeast strain DBY2055 was transformed with a high copy plasmid containing ABP1 ( pRB1201 ) , or with the same plasmid lacking the ABP1 insert ( pRB307 ) , creating the strains DBY5179 and DBY5178 , respectively ( see Table I ) . DBY5178 and DBY5179 were replica plated and grown at various temperatures under conditions selective for plasmid maintenance . DBY5178 , containing only the plasmid vector , grows normally at all temperatures , but DBY5179 , containing the plasmid carrying ABP1 , grows slowly below 35°C , and does not form colonies at 37°C . Loss of pRB1201 by growth on nonselective media allows normal colony for - mation at 37°C , and reverses all mutant phenotypes dis - cussed below . Since localization of the 85 - kD actin - binding protein to growing surfaces of a yeast cell ( Fig . 3 C ) suggests an in - volvement in cell surface growth , effect of overproduction of this protein on growth pattern and actin organization were evaluated . Anti - actin immunofluorescence of cells over - producing the 85 - kD protein ( strain DBY5179 ) , and grown Drubin et al . Actin - binding Proteins in Yeast 2557 at 21 ° or 37°C is shown in Fig . 5 . At 21°C ( Fig . 5 A ) cell mor - phology is generally normal , although cell size is increased and a few abnormally large cells can be found in the culture . As in wild - type cells , cortical actin patches are concentrated in the growing buds . However , (cid:127)10 % of the cells contain a single heavy actin bar , often emanating in the neck and ter - minating on the opposite side of the mother cell , in place of the network of actin cables normally seen in cells ( Fig . 3 A ) . Upon shift of DBY5179 cultures to 37°C for 30 or 180 min , cortical actin patches , normally concentrated in buds , be - come prominent in mother cells ( Fig . 5 , B and C , respec - tively ) . At the same time , mother cells , which normally show little growth , now enlarge , often at the expense of the buds ; the magnification is the same in all panels of Fig . 5 . These phenotypes due to overproduction of the 85 - kD actin - binding protein are similar in other haploid strains trans - formed with pRBI201 ( although temperature optima and severity of defects vary slightly ) ; however , effects on diploid cells are less severe than on haploids ( not shown ) . Shift of cells bearing pRB307 from 21 ° to 37°C has no effect on cell shape or actin organization ( not shown ) . Haploid and diploid yeast each have distinct budding pat - terns ; through successive cell cycles haploids tend to bud from one region of a yeast cell surface , while diploids bud successively from one of two opposite poles of the ellipsoid yeast cell . Budding leaves behind chitin - containing scars that can be visualized using the dye calcofluor ( Hayashibe and Katohda , 1973 ; Cabib and Bowers , 1975 ) . Fig . 6 , A and B show calcofluor - stained haploid and diploid cells , respec - tively . Overproduction of the 85 - kD actin - binding protein causes many cells cultured at 20°C to adopt aberrant pat - terns . As shown in Fig . 6 C , and quantitated in Table II , 41 % of the cells containing two or more bud scars , have scars at opposite ends . This effect appears to be quite sensitive to the temperature , being more prominent in several experiments at 20 ° than at 21°C . The cells in Fig . 6 C are distinct from the diploid cells shown in Fig . 6 B because the bud scars tend to be clustered at one end , as in normal haploid cells ( Fig . 6 A ) , however , buds occasionally form at the wrong end of the cell . In addition , many cells containing elevated levels of the 85 - kD protein stain uniformly with calcofluor at any tem - perature , and show no identifiable bud scars ( not shown ) . Discussion Yeast Actin Cytoskeleton We have identified three yeast actin - binding proteins by vir - tue of their affinity for immobilized yeast actin filaments . A 200 - kD protein appears to be a yeast myosin heavy chain ; it is dissociated from actin filaments by ATP , it has the correct size to be a myosin heavy chain , and a Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain antibody binds to it . Watts et al . ( 1985 , 1987 ) previously identified a Saccharomyces cerevisiae myosin heavy chain . The myosin identified by Watts et al . ( 1985 ) may not be identical to the 200 - kD protein identified here , because the C . elegans myosin antibody ( monoclonal 28 . 2 , kindly provided by Dr . H . Epstein , Baylor College of Medi - cine , Houston , TX ) used to identify that protein as myosin - like , did not react on immunoblots with the 200 - kD protein identified here by actin filament affinity chromatography , even though C . elegans myosin on the same blot was recog - nized with great sensitivity ( Drubin , D . G . , and D . Botstein , unpublished observation ) . Further experiments are needed to determine whether one or more yeast myosins exist . A second yeast actin - binding protein of 67 - kD was identi - fied . Immunofluorescence studies show that throughout the cell cycle this protein binds along the length of actin cables and is associated with cortical actin patches in yeast . This localization suggests that the 67 - kD protein is involved in Figure 5 . Effects of overproduction of the 85 - kD actin - binding protein on actin organization and cell morphology .

Cells were grown at 21°C . Bar , 5 gtm . multiple actin - mediated processes , a possibility supported by recent genetic findings ( Adams et al . , 1988 ; Adams and Botstein , 1988 ) . In contrast to the 67 - kD protein , the 85 - kD protein appears to associate with only a subset of actin structures , the cortical actin patches that are concentrated at the growing surfaces of yeast cells . It is a formal possibility that the 85 - kD protein associates with both actin cables and with cortical patches , but is only detected in association with patches . This possi - bility is not likely for the following reasons . First , the corti - cal patch staining by the anti - 85 - kD protein antiserum is brighter than the cortical patch staining by the anti - 67 - kD protein antiserum when viewed directly in the microscope , yet the anti - 67 - kD actin - binding protein antiserum very clear - ly stains cables , while the anti - 85 - kD actin - binding protein antiserum does not . Second , anti - 85 - kD protein antiserum stains actin bars brightly in cells containing the act1 - 2 mutant allele , making it unlikely that the 85 - kD protein can not be detected on normal actin cables due to fixation or antibody accessibility problems . We conclude that the 85 - kD protein is associated primarily with cortical actin patches . The identification of only three yeast actin - binding pro - teins by F - actin affinity chromatography may reflect a lack of protein complexity in the yeast actin cytoskeleton relative to higher cells . No additional actin - binding proteins were identified when gels containing salt - eluted fractions from ac - tin filament columns were silver stained , despite a 50 - 100 - fold increase in sensitivity ( not shown ) . This apparent low complexity could greatly simplify genetic and biochemical analyses , making possible a detailed understanding of the in - teractions within the yeast actin cytoskeleton . When extracts from a variety of other organisms are passed over rabbit F - actin columns , using similar conditions to those used in this study , 20 - 40 known and potential actin - binding proteins are identified in each case ( Miller , K . G . , and B . M . Alberts , manuscript submitted for publication ) . In the present study , Drubin et al . Actin - binding Proteins in Yeast 2559 actin was prepared from the same source as the extract ( yeast ) . Use of yeast actin should optimize the binding of yeast actin - binding proteins . Indeed , Acanthamoeba actin - binding proteins are less efficiently retained on rabbit actin columns than are mammalian actin - binding proteins ( Miller , K . G . , and B . M . Alberts , manuscript submitted for publica - tion ) . Also , the affinity of rabbit muscle myosin is 10 - fold higher for rabbit actin filaments than for yeast actin filaments ( Greet and Schekman , 1982 ) . Thus , it appears that the amino acid residues in actin that are important for interac - tions with actin - binding proteins can be significantly diverged despite the high overall actin sequence conserva - tion . Indeed , the 67 - kD yeast actin - binding protein appears to bind to yeast actin filaments , but not to rabbit actin fila - ments , while the 200 - and 85 - kD yeast actin - binding proteins bind to both rabbit and yeast actin filaments ( Drubin , D . G . , and K . G . Miller , unpublished observations ) . Our search for yeast actin - binding proteins is not exhaustive ; additional yeast actin - binding proteins may be identified by altering components of the column binding and elution buffers , such as Ca 2 + . Roles for the 85 - kD Protein in Actin Organization and Yeast Morphogenesis The association of the 85 - kD actin - binding protein exclu - sively with actin at actively growing cell surfaces suggests a role in organizing and mediating spatially localized yeast growth . As one in vivo test of function , the 85 - kD protein was overproduced in yeast . At 21°C cell morphology and cortical actin patch organization are not affected by overpro - duction of the 85 - kD protein , although the cells are slightly larger than normal . However , the actin cables that normally form an array aligned roughly along the axis of cell growth , are replaced often by a single heavy actin bar of similar align - ment . Perhaps the 85 - kD protein cross - links actin cables into bars . More experiments are needed to determine the detailed structure of these bars and to elucidate the biochemical ac - tivities of the 85 - kD protein . Also at 21°C , haploid yeast cells that overproduce the 85 - kD protein often bud aberrantly ; normally haploid Sac - charomyces cerevisiae cells bud successively from adjacent sites . The tendency for cells containing elevated levels of the 85 - kD protein , is to have clustered budding patterns like nor - mal haploids , but they appear to make mistakes occasionally and bud from the wrong pole . It is possible that the actin bar formation phenotype is functionally involved with the loss of the normal budding pattern . Perhaps the actin polarity is reversed in the bars , and organelle transport is directed to the wrong pole . Alternatively , increased levels of the 85 - kD yeast actin - binding protein could result in the formation of improperly localized cortical actin structures . This could cause membrane insertion in an abnormal position , ultimate - ly directing the formation of a bud in the wrong location . When cells containing elevated levels of the 85 - kD actin - binding protein are shifted from 21 ° to 37°C , cortical actin patches , normally restricted to buds , appear in mother cells . Coincident with this reorganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton is a reorganization of the surface growth pat - tern . This result demonstrates that the 85 - kD protein can affect the organization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton , and can affect the sites of cell surface growth . Determining what factors control the organization of the 85 - kD protein will provide additional insights into the mechanisms responsible for organizing the yeast cell . The association of cortical actin patches with regions of surface growth appears inviolate . When cdc24 , cdc42 , or cdc43 mutants are shifted to nonpermissive growth condi - tions , actin patches also appear in mother cells ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Adams , 1984 ) , and these mother cells begin to enlarge in a manner similar to that caused by overproduc - tion of the 85 - kD actin - binding protein , resulting in large un - budded cells ( Pringle et al . , 1984 ) . These three CDC genes appear to be involved in the same processes that the cortical complexes containing actin and the 85 - and 67 - kD actin - binding proteins are involved in . Interestingly , some cdc24 mutants affect budding pattern ; when they are grown under permissive conditions , bud site selection becomes random - ized ( Sloat et al . , 1981 ) . The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes a simple morphogenetic process to generate daughter cells . The actin cytoskeleton , which appears simple in composition by com - parison to the cytoskeletons of other organisms , plays a cen - tral role in yeast morphogenesis . The overall simplicity of the system , coupled with the genetics available in yeast , hold great promise for understanding in detail the interactions responsible for the morphogenesis of the organism . By iso - lating the proteins that comprise the actin cytoskeleton , and the genes that encode these proteins , we are defining these interactions and determining their in vivo importance .
