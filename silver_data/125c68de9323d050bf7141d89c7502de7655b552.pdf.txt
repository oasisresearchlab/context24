Molecular & Biochemical Parasitology 138 ( 2004 ) 67 – 77 Both of the Rab5 subfamily small GTPases of Trypanosoma brucei are essential and required for endocytosis Belinda Hall , Clare L . Allen , David Goulding , Mark C . Field ∗ Department of Biological Sciences , Imperial College , Exhibition Road , London SW7 2AY , UK Received 1 April 2004 ; received in revised form 15 July 2004 ; accepted 16 July 2004 Abstract Endocytosis is an essential process in Trypanosoma brucei and all evidence suggests it is exclusively clathrin - mediated . The trypanosome genome encodes two Rab5 proteins , small GTPases that play a role in very early stages of endocytosis . In the mammalian bloodstream stage TbRAB5A localises to compartments containing internalised antibody , variant surface glycoprotein ( VSG ) and transferrin , whilst TbRAB5B localises to compartments containing the transmembrane protein ISG 100 . Dominant - active forms of TbRAB5A stimulate endocytosis in procyclic forms and alter the kinetics of anti - VSG antibody and transferrin turnover in bloodstream stages . Similar mutants of TbRAB5B increase ﬂuid phase uptake in procyclic cells but do not signiﬁcantly affect endocytosis in bloodstream forms . Here , we use RNA interference to evaluate the relative importance of TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B and show that both GTPases are essential in the bloodstream form . Depletion of either TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B results in morphological abnormalities , including enlargement of the ﬂagellar pocket , consistent with a potent block to endocytosis . Also , RNAi compromises transferrin accumulation in both cases but induces distinct patterns of mislocalisation of endosomal markers . Finally , RNAi of either TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B results in a decrease in levels of clathrin . Taken together , these data indicate that both TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B are required for endocytosis in trypanosomes and demonstrate that there are multiple essential endocytic routes in this organism . © 2004 Elsevier B .

Introduction Trypanosoma brucei , the causative agent of African sleep - ing sickness in humans and Nagana in cattle , possesses a highly active endocytic system that has been implicated as important for uptake of nutrients ( lipoproteins and transfer - rin [ 1 , 2 ] ) , sensitivity to serum lytic factors [ 3 , 4 ] , turnover of the variant surface glycoprotein ( VSG ) coat [ 5 ] and also in removal of surface immune complexes [ 6 , 7 ] .

Field ) . the endocytic system is strongly developmentally regulated , being most active in the mammalian infective stage [ 8 ] , sug - gesting a speciﬁc role in this part of the life cycle . Recent work has identiﬁed a highly efﬁcient recycling system for VSG [ 9 , 10 ] ; the pathway involves a clathrin - dependent endocytic event followed by delivery to a sorting endosome , where VSG is negatively sorted by a second clathrin - dependent step , and ﬁnally recycling and delivery back to the surface via a TbRAB11 - containing transport structure . Additional data suggest that the sorting endosome contains at least one member of the trypanosomal Rab5 family [ 7 , 11 , 35 ] , which in higher eukaryotes mediate early endocytic transport processes as well as sorting events . A similar pathway is also taken for endocytosed anti - VSG immunoglobulin and transferrin , although kinetic measure - ments indicate the presence of potentially distinct aspects in recycling of VSG , antibody and transferrin [ 7 ] . 0166 - 6851 / $ – see front matter © 2004 Elsevier B .

Hall et al . / Molecular & Biochemical Parasitology 138 ( 2004 ) 67 – 77 The basis for the developmental regulation of endocytosis in trypanosomes is currently unknown . Neither the biologi - cal purpose of this highly active pathway , nor the molecular events underpinning the differential activity of the various life forms have been fully deﬁned . Several molecular alterations have been documented that correlate with endocytic activity ; speciﬁcally expression of both clathrin and TbRAB11 are greatly increased in the bloodstream form [ 8 , 12 ] . As both of these molecules are important mediators of the recycling sys - tem , it is likely that their expression proﬁle in some manner is used to control endocytic ﬂux . An additional alteration that accompanies increased en - docytic ﬂux in the bloodstream form is greater complexity of the Rab5 endosome population . The trypanosome genome encodes two Rab5 proteins , TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B [ 13 ] . These proteins have evolved independently of the multiple Rab5 isoforms present in other eukaryotic lineages , i . e . Sac - charomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens , suggesting that trypanosome Rab5 isoforms evolved to fulﬁll an organism speciﬁc function . In the procyclic stage , both TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B colocalise to perinuclear structures [ 13 ] , whilst in the bloodstream form the locations of these two proteins are distinct . Indeed , TbRAB5A colocalises with internalised antibody and transferrin , whilst TbRAB5B colocalises with ISG 100 , a polytopic membrane protein of unknown function [ 14 ] . These data suggest distinct roles for TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B . Overexpression of both wildtype or constitutively active forms of TbRAB5A in procyclic cells leads to an increase in endocytosis of low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) and Lucifer yellow [ 11 ] , and similar experiments in bloodstream stage cells indicate a role in intracellular transport of immunoglob - ulin and transferrin [ 7 ] . By contrast , whilst constitutively ac - tive TbRAB5B overexpression in procyclic cells is speciﬁ - cally associated with increased ﬂuid phase uptake , attempts to determine a function for TbRAB5B in BSF by these ap - proaches have been without success [ 7 ] , suggesting that ei - ther TbRAB5B has a role fully redundant and subservient to TbRAB5A in this life stage , or that the assays used were un - able to ascribe a function to TbRAB5B . Using RNA interfer - ence , we set out to determine if TbRAB5B had any detectable function . We show that TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B are both essential genes , and that each has a role in the trypanosome endocytic system . 2 . Methods and materials 2 . 1 . Maintenance of parasite cell lines The BSF90 - 13 Lister 427 bloodstream form cell line [ 15 ] was routinely cultured in HMI9 medium supplemented with 10 % tetracyclin - free foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Autogen Bioclear ) . To maintain the T7 responsive phenotype , cells were grown in the continuous presence of 5 (cid:1) g ml − 1 Hy - gromycin B and 2 . 5 (cid:1) g ml − 1 Geneticin ( Sigma ) . Cells were maintained at concentrations between 1 × 10 4 and 2 × 10 6 ml − 1 . PTT procyclic line cells ( gift of Philippe Bastin , Paris ) were cultured in SDM79 medium supplemented with 10 % FBS , 7 . 5 (cid:1) g ml − 1 haemin , 25 (cid:1) g ml − 1 Hygromycin B and 25 (cid:1) g ml − 1 Geneticin . For growth curves , triplicate cul - tures were initiated at 1 × 10 5 ml − 1 with or without tetracy - clin at a concentration of 1 (cid:1) g ml − 1 . Cell concentration was determined using a Z2 Coulter counter ( Beckman ) . 2 . 2 . RNAi constructs and transfections TbRAB5AandTbRAB5Bsequencescorrespondingtothe entire open reading frame ( ORF ) , were ﬁrst veriﬁed using RNAit to ensure lack of sufﬁcient homology to produce RNAi cross - suppression [ 16 ] , and then the ORFs excised from the plasmids pXS519 · TbRAB5A and pXS519 · TbRAB5B , respectively [ 11 ] , by digestion with Bam HI and Hin dIII , and inserted into p2T7Ti [ 17 ] . For transfection , plasmids were digested with Not I , ethanol precipitated and resus - pended in sterile water . The BSF90 - 13 and PTT lines were transfected by electroporation with 5 (cid:1) g DNA as described [ 11 ] . After electroporation , BSF cells were transferred to fresh medium and incubated for 166 h before addition of 2 . 5 (cid:1) g ml − 1 Zeocin ( Invitrogen ) . TransfectedBSF90 - 13cells were grown in the presence of the selective drug for 1 week and then cloned . PTT cells were selected with Zeocin for 4 weeks . 2 . 3 . Western blotting Cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in SDS sample buffer . Cells were loaded on 12 % SDS PAGE gels at 1 × 10 7 cell equivalents per lane . After separation , proteins were transferred onto Hybond nitrocellulose paper ( Amersham Biosciences ) . Blots were blocked with PBS / 5 % milk / 0 . 1 % Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature , then in - cubated overnight at 4 ◦ C in the presence of afﬁnity puri - ﬁed rabbit anti - TbRAB5A , mouse anti - TbRAB5B or rabbit anti - TbCLH antibodies at a concentration of approximately 1 (cid:1) g ml − 1 in blocking buffer [ 7 , 8 ] . Blots were washed in PBS / 0 . 1 % Tween 20 then incubated with peroxidase conju - gated goat anti - rabbit or anti - mouse IgG ( Sigma ) for 1 h . Pro - teins were visualised by ECL . To ensure equality of loading , blotswerestrippedandreprobedwithantibodytoTbBiP [ 18 ] . Band intensity was quantiﬁed using NIHimage software . 2 . 4 . Uptake of FM4 - 64 Microscopic analysis of FM4 - 64 uptake and recycling was carried out by a modiﬁcation of the assay described by Wiederkehr et al . [ 19 ] . Cells induced with 1 (cid:1) g ml − 1 tetracyclin for 18 h were harvested , washed twice in TES buffer ( 120 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 3 mM MgSO 4 , 16 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 5 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 30 mM TES , 10 mM glucose , 0 . 1 mM adenosine ) then resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 10 7 ml − 1 in TES . Cells were pre - equilibrated for 20 min B . Hall et al . / Molecular & Biochemical Parasitology 138 ( 2004 ) 67 – 77 69 at 4 ◦ C or 37 ◦ C , then 20 (cid:1) M FM4 - 64 ( Molecular Probes ) was added . Cells were incubated for 5 min in the presence of FM4 - 64 , then placed on ice , washed once in TES buffer and ﬁxed for 1 h at 4 ◦ C with 4 % paraformaldehyde . Fixed cells were washed in PBS , adhered to poly - l - lysine slides ( Sigma ) and mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI ( Vectalabs ) . 2 . 5 . Immunoﬂuorescence Cellswereﬁxedin4 % paraformaldehyde , adheredtopoly - l - lysine slides ( Sigma ) and permeabilised with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . Slides were blocked with 10 % goat serum in PBS . For staining of TbRABs , slides were incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C with anti - TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B antibodies diluted to 2 (cid:1) g ml − 1 in blocking buffer containing 0 . 02 % sodium azide . All other primary antibody incubations were carried out for 1 h at room temperature . After washing with PBS , slides were incubated with Texas - Red conjugated goat anti - rabbit or - mouse IgG ( Molecular Probes ) for 1 h at room tem - perature . Slides were washed and mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI ( Vector Laboratories ) . Cells were exam - ined under a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope and images were captured using a Photometrix Coolsnap FX camera con - trolled with Metamorph software ( Universal Imaging Corp . ) and assembled in Photoshop 7 . 0 . 1 ( Adobe Inc . ) . 2 . 6 . Uptake of transferrin and concanavalin A Cells were incubated for 18 h with 1 (cid:1) g ml − 1 tetracyclin , harvested and washed once in serum free HMI9 medium con - taining 1 % BSA . Cells were resuspended in HMI9 / BSA at a concentration of 1 × 10 7 ml − 1 and incubated at 4 ◦ C or 37 ◦ C for 20 min . Either FITC - transferrin ( 10 (cid:1) g ml − 1 ) ( Molecular Probes ) or FITC - Con A ( 10 (cid:1) g ml − 1 ) ( Vectalabs ) were added and the cells incubated for various times up to 30 min . Uptake was stopped by placing on ice . Labelled cells were washed in HMI9 / BSA at 4 ◦ C , then ﬁxed and adhered to slides as described above . Slides were either mounted immediately or counterstained with antibody . 2 . 7 . Electron microscopy For transmission electron microscopy , cells were ﬁxed in suspension by adding chilled 5 % glutaraldehyde ( TAAB ) and 8 % paraformaldehyde ( Sigma ) in PBS in a 1 : 1 ratio to the growth medium containing trypanosomes . The ﬁnal dilutions were therefore 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde and 4 % paraformalde - hyde . Cells were ﬁxed on ice for 10 min , centrifuged at 10 , 000 rpm for 5 min in 2 ml eppendorfs , the supernatant carefully replaced with fresh ﬁxative for a further 50 min without disturbing the pellet , rinsed in 0 . 1 M sodium cacody - late and post ﬁxed in 1 % osmium tetroxide ( TAAB ) in the same buffer at room temperature for 1 h . After rinsing in buffer , cells were then dehydrated in an ethanol series , adding 1 % uranyl acetate at the 30 % stage , followed by propylene oxide and then embedded in Epon / Araldite 502 ( TAAB ) and ﬁnally polymerized at 60 ◦ C for 48 h . Sections were cut on a Leica Ultracut T ultramicrotome at 70 nm using a diamond knife , contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and ex - amined on a Philips CM100 transmission electron micro - scope . 2 . 8 . Endocytosis of transferrin Bovine holo - transferrin ( Sigma ) was iodinated using IodoBeads reagent ( Pierce ) following the manufacturer’s in - structions . Endocytosis was monitored essentially as de - scribed previously [ 11 ] , but with the following modiﬁcations . Bloodstream form cells were induced for 18 – 24 h with tetra - cycline , harvested and washed with serum - free HMI9 / 1 % BSA . Aliquots of these cultures were taken for Western anal - ysis to conﬁrm knockdown of the relevant TbRAB5 isoform . Cells were resuspended in serum free HMI - 9 medium sup - plemented with 1 % bovine serum albumin at 2 × 10 7 cells / ml for 30 min at 37 ◦ C to empty transferrin receptors . Cells were then pulsed with 125 I - transferrin ( typically ∼ 2 (cid:1) g at a speciﬁc activity of 3 × 10 6 cpm / (cid:1) g ) , and aliquots ( 0 . 5 ml ) withdrawn at varying times . Aliquots were added to pre - cooledmicrocentrifugetubesinacoldblockonicecontaining0 . 5 ml HMI - 9 / 1 % BSA / 600 (cid:1) g ml − 1 unlabelled transferrin . Cells were washed twice by pelleting in a refrigerated mi - crofuge for 30 s at top speed and resuspending in PBS / 0 . 5 % BSA , and then accumulated radioactivity determined by γ - counter . Data are represented as the difference between cell - associated radioactivity at t = 0 and 40 min . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Both TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B are essential in bloodstream forms When RNAi was induced for either TbRAB5 isoform in bloodstream cells , a dramatic loss of viability was observed ( Fig . 1 ) . For TbRAB5A , protein expression became unde - tectable at 24 h , whilst residual protein could be detected for TbRAB5B . No change was observed in expression of the ER protein BiP or in expression of the related Rab proteins TbRAB4 and TbRAB11 ( data not shown ) , indicating that the loss of expression was speciﬁc ; hence both proteins are rapidly turned over and appear to be required for continued replication . A speciﬁc block in cell cycle progression could not be detected by analysis of nuclear and kinetoplast kary - otype ( data not shown ) . 3 . 2 . Depletion of TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B results in an enlarged ﬂagellar pocket Depletion of either TbRAB5 isoform resulted in the emer - gence of abnormal cells . At later times in induced cultures , these abnormal forms predominate ( data not shown ) . For TbRAB5A , theappearanceofaphase - lightvacuolarstructure 70 B . Hall et al . / Molecular & Biochemical Parasitology 138 ( 2004 ) 67 – 77 Fig . 1 . RNA interference of TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B results in growth ces - sation . Growth curves for cells transformed with the p2T7 RNAi constructs for TbRAB5A ( squares ) and TbRAB5B ( triangles ) in the presence ( closed ) and absence ( open ) of 1 (cid:1) gml − 1 tetracycline . Cell number was determined by Coulter counter at the indicated times of triplicate cultures . Induction was begun at time = 0 . Arrowhead indicates dilution of cultures to initial concentration to avoid overgrowth of uninduced cells . Lower panel shows suppression of TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B protein expression by RNAi . Cul - tures were sampled at 0 , 6 and 24h , cells were lysed and proteins separated by SDS - PAGE followed by Western blotting for TbRAB5A , TbRAB5B and for TbBiP as loading control . at the posterior end of the cell was observed at 12 h , with a progressively more pronounced morphology accumulating at later times of induction ( Fig . 2A ) . A similar , although less severe , morphology was observed with RNAi of TbRAB5B and in this case a vacuole appeared at ∼ 24 h . Electron mi - croscopy demonstrated that the vacuolar structure was the ﬂagellar pocket ( Fig . 2B ) , as evidenced by the presence of both a ﬂagellum cross - section and matrix material within the lumen of the structure . A rather more extreme and rapid en - largement of the pocket was obtained with the TbRAB5A RNAi compared to the TbRAB5B RNAi . At 18 h , approxi - mately 43 % of cells lacking TbRAB5A expression displayed an enlarged ﬂagellar pocket when examined by EM ( n = 150 ) , whilst in the case of TbRAB5B RNAi , only 15 % of the in - duced cells were positive for morphological defect ( n = 85 ) . As the ﬂagellar pocket is the sole site of endocytic and exo - cytic pathway interaction with the plasma membrane , these data are consistent with a major role in membrane transport for both of these proteins . The effect is broadly similar to the BigEye phenotype reported for RNAi of the trypanosome clathrin heavy chain [ 20 ] , where endocytosis , but not ex - ocytosis , was inhibited . However , unlike the BigEye cells the ﬂagellar pocket membrane is not perfectly circular , but folded and crenulated ; this is more apparent for TbRAB5B RNAi than TbRAB5A and may reﬂect the severity of the defect in membrane transport . The observation that deple - tion of either protein is lethal demonstrates that the respec - tive roles of TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B are non - redundant . This is in sharp contrast to studies in S . cerevisiae , where knockout of individual Rab5 homologues ( Ypt51 , Ypt52 and Ypt53 ) is non - lethal and suggestive of signiﬁcant redundancy [ 21 ] . 3 . 3 . Endocytosis is altered in TbRAB5 RNAi cells FM4 - 64 is a lipid - binding probe that can be used to fol - low endocytosis in T . brucei [ 20 ] . Cells were induced for 18 h and allowed to take up FM4 - 64 . In both lines , unin - duced cells showed clear labelling of multiple vesicles in the early endocytic compartment between the nucleus and ﬂag - ellar pocket , but after induction the dye appeared to enter the cell but was limited to regions close to the enlarged ﬂag - ellar pocket ( Fig . 3A ) . This suggests that both TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B play a role in the early stages of endocytic trafﬁcking and is the ﬁrst indication that TbRAB5B may be involved in bloodstream form endocytosis in addition to the role already established for TbRAB5A [ 7 , 11 ] . In order to conﬁrm that uptake is blocked in the induced cells and that the inhibition is a genuine effect of TbRAB5 RNAi on endocytosis rather than rearrangement of the endo - cytic compartment , cells were labelled with the mannose - binding lectin , concanavalin A ( Con A ) , a highly useful reagent for the analysis of general membrane protein en - docytosis [ 22 ] . At 4 ◦ C , Con A accumulates in the ﬂagellar pocket , but at 37 ◦ C the lectin is endocytosed , and accumu - lates within the lysosome , as deﬁned by antibody against p67 [ 23 ] . In induced TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B RNAi cells , Con A was localised to the ﬂagellar pocket at 4 ◦ C ( data not shown ) and whilst taken up at 37 ◦ C , did not appear to progress as efﬁciently as in the uninduced cells ( Fig . 3B ) . This was con - ﬁrmed by counterstaining cells that had internalised Con A at 37 ◦ C with antibody to p67 . In uninduced cells , the bulk of internalised Con A colocalised with p67 , but in induced TbRAB5A RNAi cells the majority of Con A failed to reach the lysosome as colocalisation was not obtained between Con A and p67 . A pronounced decrease in Con A lysosomal deliv - ery was also apparent for the TbRAB5B RNAi cells . Quanti - tation of the degree of Con A and p67 colocalisation revealed a profound block in transport in both cells ( Fig . 3C ) . These data suggest a partial block in endocytosis in cells lacking either Rab5 isoform . 3 . 4 . Transferrin endocytosis The analysis above is highly suggestive of a signiﬁcant defect in endocytic activity as a consequence of suppres - sion of TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B . However , neither FM4 - 64 nor Con A represent naturally transported ligands for try - panosomes . Therefore , the effect of TbRAB5 RNAi on BSF transferrinuptakewasdetermined .

Panel A : Phase and DAPI ﬂuorescence images for RNAi of TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B . For each set of images , “ + ” denotes induced , “ − ” denotes uninduced . For TbRAB5A , the leftmost pair of induced images is from cultures exposed to tetracycline for 12h , and the remainder for 24h . All induced images for TbRAB5B are from cultures induced for 24h . Panel B : Ultrastructural analysis by EM of wildtype 427 BSF and cells under RNAi for TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B for 18h . Note the presence of the enlarged ﬂagellar pocket in both cases . The severity of the morphological defect for TbRAB5A is somewhat greater and more rapid in onset than for TbRAB5B . F denotes ﬂagellum . FITC - transferrin was impaired in both cell lines after induc - tion , but the impact of TbRAB5A RNAi was more severe than for TbRAB5B RNAi ( Fig . 3D ) . To obtain a more quantitative indication of the inﬂuence of RAB5 RNAi on macromolecular uptake , we analysed accu - mulation of 125 I - radiolabelled transferrin . Cells were induced for 18 – 24 h and then subjected to analysis . Induction was monitored by Western blotting for the respective TbRAB5 protein and was suppressed as expected ( data not shown ) . From prior work , we selected a 40 min pulse period [ 11 ] for our analysis and compared transferrin accumulation in in - duced and uninduced cells with a nontransfected parental 427 bloodstream form cell line ( Fig . 3E ) . Accumulation of trans - ferrin by BSF cells under RNAi for TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B 72 B . Hall et al . / Molecular & Biochemical Parasitology 138 ( 2004 ) 67 – 77 was substantially decreased to less than 60 % of the wild - type level . IFA staining showed that induction of TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B RNAi does not appear to alter localisation of ESAG6 / 7 , the transferrin receptor ( data not shown ) . The re - duction in transferrin uptake is therefore likely to be the result of a blockade to endocytosis . 3 . 5 . Tomato lectin - binding proteins accumulate at the ﬂagellar pocket in TbRAB5 RNAi A number of proteins that are resident within endosomal compartments , including ISG 100 , have been shown to bind to Lycopersicon lycopersicum lectin [ 24 ] , presumably due to B .

In parental bloodstream form cells , tomato lectin staining is localised to the endosomal compartments ( Fig . 4 ) residing between the nucleus and kinetoplast . In cells with TbRAB5B RNAi , lectin - binding is found closely associated with the ﬂagellar pocket , whilst RNAi of TbRAB5A has less impact on distribution of tomato lectin reactive sites . This suggests that the trafﬁcking of tomato lectin - binding proteins in T . brucei depends on both Rab5 isoforms , but TbRAB5B may play a more signiﬁcant role . However , in neither case was the localisation to the enlarged ﬂagellar pocket complete , Fig . 3 . RNAi of TbRAB5 isoforms alters endocytosis .

Following induction , bloodstream form trypanosomes were washed and incubated in medium containing 125 I - transferrin . Aliquots were withdrawn at various times and cells washed to remove unbound transferrin and the amount accumulated by the cells determined by γ - counting . Data were normalised to 100 % for untransfected parental cell line , and are shown for a 40min uptake period .

Data are the mean of two duplicate determinations and the variance between replicates are shown by error bars . Data for TbRAB5A are shown in light bars and for TbRAB5B in dark bars . consistent with the partial inhibition observed with Con A as an endocytic tracer . 3 . 6 . Clathrin is expressed at decreased levels in TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B RNAi cells In order to determine if the effects of TbRAB5 suppression on morphology and endocytosis were mediated through inter - actions with components of the endocytic coat system , we ex - amined cells for clathrin expression levels . Western analysis indicated that clathrin expression was signiﬁcantly decreased by RNAi of TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B ( Fig . 5A ) . Depletion was much slower in onset than by direct RNAi of clathrin , as beﬁts a synthetic interaction as opposed to direct suppres - sion ( Fig . 5B ) . By immunoﬂuorescence there is an apparent accumulation of clathrin around the ﬂagellar pocket , most noticeably in the TbRAB5A depleted cells ( Fig . 5C ) . Immu - noEM conﬁrmed the continued presence of clathrin coats of membrane ﬁgures subtending the ﬂagellar pocket ( Fig . 5D ) , suggesting that the ability to initiate formation of clathrin - coated pits is not compromised in cells lacking expression of TbRAB5A . The apparent quantitative discrepancy between immunoblot and microscopic analysis is probably due to het - erogeneity in the population . We have previously observed that complete ablation of clathrin expression results in rapid cell death , hence biasing the observable population towards those cells still retaining some clathrin [ 20 ] . 4 . Discussion In higher eukaryotes , the Rab5 GTPase subfamily are in - volved in early events in endocytosis , including the very ﬁrst steps of membrane internalisation , in sorting in the early en - dosome and also in phagocytosis [ 25 ] . The complex function of Rab5 proteins is reﬂected in the large number of effector proteins with which these GTPases interact , including teth - ering factors , of which EEA1 is the best characterised exam - ple , components of the SNARE fusion machinery and phos - phatidylinositol kinases , e . g . [ 26 , 27 ] . Rab5 is present on both clathrin - coated vesicles and early endosomes and promotes fusion by coordinating the interactions of effector proteins 74 B .

Class I clathrin - coated vesicles budding from the ﬂagellar pocket ( left panel ) are clearly visible , as are class II sorting clathrin - coated structures associated with internal endosomal structures ( right panel ) [ 9 ] . FP : ﬂagellar pocket lumen . B . Hall et al . / Molecular & Biochemical Parasitology 138 ( 2004 ) 67 – 77 75 on the vesicle and acceptor membranes [ 28 ] . However , the requirement for cytosolic Rab5 - GDI for ligand sequestration into clathrin - coated pits in vitro and the ability of plasma membrane targeted mutants of Rab5 to interfere with inter - nalisation of the EGF receptor point to an additional role in clathrin - coated vesicle formation [ 29 , 30 ] . Despite the impressive degree of molecular characterisa - tion of Rab5 , it is still unclear as to what speciﬁc roles the three different members of the human or yeast Rab5 family play . In yeast , it has not been possible to dissect distinct func - tions for these proteins , whilst in mammals some speciﬁcity has been demonstrated . For example , activation of endocy - tosis via the EGF receptor requires Rab5a function , but not Rab5b or Rab5c [ 31 ] . The Rab5 isoforms also display differ - ences in their phosphorylation potential [ 32 ] and inducibil - ity by interferon - (cid:2) [ 33 ] . There are also subtle distinctions in the interactions between mammalian Rab5a and Rab5b with EEA1 that may underpin distinct functionality [ 34 ] . In T . brucei , the variation in sequence between the two Rab5 isoforms is much greater than that between the vari - ous mammalian forms and previous evidence has suggested distinct functions for the two enzymes [ 7 , 11 ] . This is based on differences in the kinetics of uptake in trypanosomes ex - pressing mutant Rab5 proteins and on the presence of a dif - ferent cargo set in the TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B endosome populations . Multiple and non - redundant routes through the early endosome is one potential interpretation of these data , and would indicate selection of distinct cargo molecules for speciﬁc routes . However , it is formally possible that these data reﬂect differences in the steady state distribu - tions of molecules transiting the endosomal system , rather than truly distinct pathways . This latter possibility would im - ply considerable redundancy in function between TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B . Interestingly , expression of dominant mu - tant forms of TbRAB5A ( GTP - or GDP - locked forms ) leads to alterations in receptor - mediated endocytosis in both pro - cyclic and bloodstream form , but mutant forms of TbRAB5B have no detectable transport phenotype in bloodstream forms and only alter ﬂuid phase uptake in procyclic trypanosomes [ 7 , 11 ] . Taken together , the data indicate at best a minor role for TbRAB5B in endocytosis . This study demonstrates that RNAi of either TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B is lethal in bloodstream forms , indicating es - sential and distinct functions for these two proteins . In ad - dition , the phenotype observed is consistent with a role in membrane uptake from the ﬂagellar pocket , as enlargement of the pocket , as observed here , can arise by ablation of en - docytosis by RNAi against clathrin [ 20 ] . Interestingly , the phenotype for TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B is less severe than for the clathrin RNAi suggesting that whilst the vast ma - jority of endocytosis from the pocket is clathrin - mediated , this transport may be dissected into more than one compo - nent utilising distinct TbRAB5 isoforms . As the TbRAB5A phenotype is the more rapid in onset , the TbRAB5A route may be quantitatively more important than the TbRAB5B route , consistent with previous data . Further , both TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B RNAi cells have a defect in concanavalin A delivery to the lysosome . Even more compelling is the de - tection of a signiﬁcant decrease in transferrin accumulation in cells suppressed for TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B . Taken to - gether , these data demonstrate a clear role for both TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B in endocytosis . The effect of TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B RNAi on the lo - cation of tomato lectin reactive proteins is intriguing , given that little effect is seen on the localisation of known TL - ligands , such as the transferrin receptor and ISG 100 and that TL staining has been shown to predominantly colocalise with TbRAB5A . However , the relative contributions of speciﬁc proteins to the TL signal and the mechanisms regulating their location are not known . The ability of TbRAB5B RNAi to induce a pattern of relocalisation of TL - binding sites absent in TbRAB5A RNAi suggests that TbRAB5B may regulate trafﬁcking of hitherto uncharacterised TL - reactive proteins , or of other proteins which control sorting of polylactosamine N - glycan - modiﬁed proteins . The surface coat of the T . brucei bloodstream form is subject to continuous , rapid turnover [ 10 ] . Recent work documenting endocytosis of VSG [ 9 ] indicates that the trypanosome endocytic system is dominated by clathrin - mediated pathways . The data presented here and in previ - ous work indicates that these pathways can be subdivided into at least two distinct routes , characterised by dependence on TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B . The appearance of an enlarged ﬂagellar pocket indicates a direct role for trypanosomal Rab5 proteins in the earliest stages of endocytosis , whilst the de - crease in the levels of clathrin also suggests a close inter - action between TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B and the clathrin coat system . The loss of the TbRAB5 proteins could lead to clathrin degradation through an increase in the protease sus - ceptible pool of clathrin when budding and fusion of clathrin - coated vesicles is blocked . A direct association between Rab5 and clathrin expression levels has not been observed in other systems , but Rab5 and its effectors do interact with coated pits and have been linked functionally to the early stages of clathrin - coated pit formation [ 28 – 30 ] . A more indirect ef - fect may also be responsible : recent work indicates Rab5 - dependent signal transduction regulates actin remodelling in mammalian cells , and actin RNAi in T . brucei induces very similar physical changes in cell morphology as clathrin loss and also inhibits endocytosis [ 36 , 37 ] . Interactions between Rab5 and the actin cytoskeleton are mediated by the GTPase activating protein , RN - Tre [ 36 ] . If TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B share similar such effectors , RNAi of either protein might trigger the same cellular response . Interaction with clathrin via actin thus provides an alternative potential mechanism for the effects of TbRAB5 RNAi on early endocytosis . It is not clear whether the effects of TbRAB5 RNAi on endocytosis and on cell morphology are attributable solely to the decrease in clathrin levels rather than being a direct result of Rab protein loss , or are due to a combination of the two phenomena . Unique features of the T . brucei endocytic ap - paratus , including rapid turnover rates , complete dependence 76 B . Hall et al . / Molecular & Biochemical Parasitology 138 ( 2004 ) 67 – 77 on clathrin - mediated uptake and lack of AP2 - like complexes may combine to make the system particularly vulnerable to disruption via Rab5 knockout . Unfortunately , the require - ment for both isoforms to maintain normal levels of clathrin limits further functional analysis of the two pathways using RNAi . However , the data show that the two TbRAB5 proteins are not redundant but are both essential to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and survival . The extreme sensitivity of the trypanosome to factors interfering with internalisation and trafﬁcking highlights the therapeutic potential of target - ing drugs against components of the endocytic system .
