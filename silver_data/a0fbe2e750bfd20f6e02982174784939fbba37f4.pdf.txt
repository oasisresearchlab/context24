Expression of esophageal cancer related gene 4 ( ECRG4 ) , a novel tumor suppressor gene , in esophageal cancer and its inhibitory effect on the tumor growth in vitro and in vivo Lin - Wei Li , (cid:1) Xi - Ying Yu , Yang Yang , Chun - Peng Zhang , Li - Ping Guo and Shih - Hsin Lu * State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Department of Etiology and Carcinogenesis , Cancer Institute & Hospital , Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College , Beijing , People’s Republic of China The ECRG4 gene was initially identiﬁed and cloned in our labora - tory from human normal esophageal epithelium ( GenBank acces - sion no . AF325503 ) . We revealed the expression of ECRG4 protein was downregulated in 68 . 5 % ( 89 / 130 ) ESCC samples using tissue microarray . The low ECRG4 protein expression was signiﬁcantly associated with regional lymph node metastasis , primary tumor size , and tumor stage in ESCC ( p < 0 . 05 ) . ECRG4 mRNA expres - sion was downregulated in ESCC due to the hypermethylation in the gene promoter . The treatment with 5 - aza - 2 0 - deoxycytidine , which is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor restored ECRG4 mRNA expression in ESCC cells . The result indicated that pro - moter hypermethylation may be 1 main mechanism leading to the silencing of ECRG4 . The high expression of ECRG4 in patients with ESCC was associated with longer survival compared with those with low ECRG4 expression by Kaplan - Meier survival anal - ysis ( p < 0 . 05 ) . ECRG4 protein was an independent prognostic fac - tor for ESCC by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regres - sion analysis ( p < 0 . 05 ) . The restoration of ECRG4 expression in ESCC cells inhibited cell proliferation , colony formation , anchor - age - independent growth , cell cycle progression and tumor growth in vivo ( p < 0 . 05 ) . The transfection of ECRG4 gene in ESCC cells inhibited the expression of NF - j B and nuclear translocation , in addition to the expression of COX - 2 , a NF - j B target gene , was attenuated . Taken together , ECRG4 is a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene in ESCC , and ECRG4 protein is a candidate prognostic marker for ESCC . ' 2009 UICC Key words : ECRG4 ; ESCC ; prognosis ; tumor suppressor Esophageal cancer ranks 7th and 6th , respectively , in terms of cancer incidence and mortality rate worldwide . 1 Moreover , 50 % of esophageal cancer cases in the world occurred in China . 2 Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) is the most common histological subtype , which accounts for (cid:1) 90 % of all esophageal carcinomas diagnosed in China each year . To date , the molecular pathogenesis of ESCC is still unclear . As a result , a major research effort has been directed at identify and cloning novel speciﬁc esophageal cancer related genes , which might play important roles in ESCC carcinogenesis . 3 , 4 The ECRG4 gene ( GenBank accession no . AF325503 ) was ini - tially identiﬁed and cloned in our laboratory from human normal esophageal epithelium . 5 , 6 We compared the differential genes expression between human normal esophageal epithelia and ESCCs from high incidence families in Linxian of Northern China through the effective mRNA differential display technique . Then we obtained a 772 - bp full - length cDNA of the ECRG4 gene by SMART TM RACE technique . The ECRG4 gene is located at chromosome 2q12 . 2 . It contains 4 exons , spans about 12 , 500 bp and has a 444 - bp open reading frame encoding a 148 - amino acid polypeptide with molecular weight of 17 kDa . Northern blot assay revealed that ECRG4 was expressed in various tissues including heart , brain , placenta , lung , liver , skeletal muscle , kidney and pancreas . 7 Our previous results demonstrated that ECRG4 mRNA level was highly expressed in adult esophageal epithelia , but it was downregulated in ESCC tis - sues and cell lines . 8 These ﬁndings suggest that the ECRG4 gene might be involved in ESCC carcinogenesis . However , the mecha - nism for loss of ECRG4 expression in ESCC remains unclear . In the present study , we investigated the mechanisms of ECRG4 inactivation in ESCC . Furthermore , we evaluated the clin - ical prognostic signiﬁcance of ECRG4 expression for ESCC patients and the correlation between downregulation of ECRG4 protein expression and clinicopathologic features using tissue microassay analysis . Then we examined the tumor - suppressing function of ECRG4 in ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo and explored the possible pathway in which ECRG4 might be involved . Material and methods Tissue specimens and cell lines Esophageal tumor tissue and adjacent normal epithelia speci - mens were collected by the Department of Pathology from 130 patients who underwent surgical resection with histologically con - ﬁrmed ESCC at Cancer Hospital , Chinese Academy of Medical Science , between 1999 and 2006 . None of the patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy , neo - adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy . Primary tumor tissues and the corresponding normal esophageal mucosa from the same patients were separated by experienced pathologists and immediately stored at 2 70 (cid:1) C until use . This study was approved by the institutional review board of Cancer Hospital , Chinese Academy of Medical Science . All the patients signed informed consent forms for sample collec - tion . After follow - up , the survival information of 73 patients after surgery was obtained . The human esophageal squamous cell line EC9706 was established and studied by Han et al . 9 The other 2 esophageal squamous cell lines NEC and EC109 were established and studied previously in our laboratory . 8 Construction of eukaryotic expression vector and stable transfection The coding region of ECRG4 cDNA was subcloned into consti - tutive mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 . 1 ( Invitrogen ) .

Int . J . Cancer : 125 , 1505 – 1513 ( 2009 ) ' 2009 UICC PublicationoftheInternationalUnionAgainstCancer introduced during the PCR ampliﬁcation . The resulting plasmid construct was named pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRG4 . EC9706 cells were seeded in 6 - cm dishes at 5 3 10 5 cells / dish and transfected with pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRG4 and pcDNA3 . 1 using lipofectamine TM 2000 ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer’s protocol . After cul - turing in medium containing 400 l g / ml of geneticin ( Invitrogen ) for 3 weeks , individual clones were isolated . Clones that expressed the ECRG4 cDNA coding region were maintained in medium con - taining 200 l g / ml of geneticin and used for further experiments . Puriﬁcation of ECRG4 fusion protein and production of polyclonal antibody A 688 - bp fragment of ECRG4 cDNA was excised from pGEM - T - ECRG4 and subcloned into the pET30a ( 1 ) plasmid , producing an inducible expression vector coding for His - tagged ECRG4 solu - ble protein . Subsequently , the recombinant plasmids were trans - formed into Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells to produce N - termi - nal His - tagged soluble ECRG4 protein . Fusion protein expression in Escherichia coli BL21 cells was induced with 0 . 3 mM isopro - pyl - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) , and the protein was puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography with nickel - nitrilotriacetic acid ( Ni - NTA ) resin ( Novagen ) , according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The puriﬁed fusion protein was dialyzed in phosphate - buffered sa - line ( PBS ; 0 . 1M sodium phosphate and 0 . 15M sodium chloride [ pH 7 . 4 ] ) to remove the denaturant . The ECRG4 soluble protein was used to produce polyclonal antibody in rabbit or for functional experiments . 10 Rabbit experiments were approved by the institu - tional review board of animal care of the Animal Center , Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences .

Western blot analysis Whole - cell lysates of EC9706 cells were prepared by incubating cells in RIPA buffer ( 1 % NP - 40 ; 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate ; 0 . 1 % SDS ; 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] ) containing protease inhibi - tors . Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 10 minutes at 4 (cid:1) C . The supernatant was collected , and the protein concentration was measured using the BCA TM Protein Assay Kit ( Pierce ) . Pro - teins ( 40 l g ) in cell lysates or culture media were separated by 10 – 15 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto PVDF membrane . The membranes were blocked in TBST ( 0 . 2 M NaCl ; 10 mM Tris pH7 . 4 ; 0 . 2 % Tween20 ) / 5 % skim milk for 2 hr at room temperature and then incubated with primary anti - bodies in TBST / 5 % skim milk . The primary antibodies used for Western blot analysis were polyclonal rabbit anti - ECRG4 ( 1 : 2 , 000 ) , monoclonal mouse anti - p65 ( 1 : 2 , 000 ) , polyclonal goat anti - COX - 2 ( 1 : 2 , 000 ) , monoclonal mouse anti - I j B a ( 1 : 2 , 000 ) , monoclonal mouse anti - b - tublin ( 1 : 4 , 000 ) and monoclonal mouse anti - b - actin ( 1 : 4 , 000 ) . The membranes were then washed 3 times with TBST , followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody ( 1 : 4 , 000 ) in TBST / 5 % skim milk . Bound antibody was visualized using ECL detection reagent . Nu - clear and cytoplasmic protein extraction from EC9706 were done by using commercially available kit ( Kit number 78833 , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc . , Rockford , IL ) . Cell proliferation assay Stable - transfected cells ( pcDNA3 . 1 and pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRGR4 ) were seeded into 96 - well plates ( 1 . 5 3 10 3 cells / well ) . After cul - turing for various durations , cell proliferation was evaluated by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay , according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Sigma - Aldrich Co . , St . Louis , MO ) . In brief , 10 l l MTT solution ( 5 mg / ml ) was added to each well , then the cells were cultured for another 4 hr at 37 (cid:1) C . DMSO ( 100 l l ) was added to each well and mix vigorously to solubilize colored crystals produced within the living cells . The absorbance at 570 nm was measured by using a multi - well scanning spectrophotome - ter Victor 3 . Colony formation assay Stable - transfected cells ( pcDNA3 . 1 and pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRG4 ) were seeded into six - well plates at 200 cells per well in RPMI - 1640 with 10 % FBS . Fourteen days later , formed colonies were ﬁxed in methanol and stained with 1 % crystal violet . Colonies that contained more than 50 cells were counted . Anchorage - independent growth in soft agar assay Six - well plates were precoated with 0 . 6 % soft agar in RPMI - 1640 with 10 % FBS , then stable - transfected cells ( pcDNA3 . 1 and pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRG4 ) were seeded at 500 cells per well in 0 . 3 % agar / RPMI - 1640 with 10 % FBS . The plates were incubated for 2 weeks at 37 (cid:1) C . Colonies that contained more than 50 cells were counted . 11 Tumor growth in vivo Six - week - old female BALB / c nude mice were housed at 4 mice per cage and fed ad libitum with autoclaved food . The ECRG4 - transfected ( pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRG4 ) or mock - transfected ( pcDNA3 . 1 ) cells ( 1 3 10 6 ) were incubated in Trypsin - EDTA ( Invitrogen ) , washed with PBS , centrifuged at 1 , 500 g for 5 minutes , resus - pended in PBS , and injected subcutaneously into the armpit region of nude mice . Injected mice were examined every 4 days for tu - mor appearance , and tumor sizes were estimated from length ( a ) and width ( b ) of tumors , as measured by calipers , using the for - mula V 5 ab 2 / 2 . 12 Mouse experiments were approved by the insti - tutional review board of animal care of the Animal Center , Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences . ESCC tissue microarray and immunohistochemical ( IHC ) staining Formalin - ﬁxed , parafﬁn - embedded esophageal tumors and the corresponding normal epithelia were placed on the tissue microar - ray . For immunohistochemical analysis , the slides were deparafﬁ - nized , rehydrated , immersed in 3 % hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes and cooled down at room temperature for 60 minutes . The slides were blocked by 10 % normal goat serum at 37 (cid:1) C for 30 minutes , and then incubated with anti - ECRG4 rabbit polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1 : 500 for 3 hr at 37 (cid:1) C . After washed with PBS , the slides were incubated with biotinylated secondary anti - body ( diluted 1 : 100 ) for 30 minutes at 37 (cid:1) C . Immunolabeling was visualized with a mixture of 3 , 3 0 - diaminobenzidine solution . Counter - staining was carried out with hematoxylin . Expression score was determined by staining intensity and percentage of im - munoreactive cells . Tissues with no staining were rated as 0 , with a faint staining or moderate to strong staining in < 25 % of cells as 1 , with moderate or strong staining in 25 – 50 % of cells as 2 , and strong staining in > 50 % of cells as 3 . Staining ( 25 % ) was used as cut - off point to deﬁne high ECRG4 expression and low ECRG4 expression . Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle The transfected cells ( pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRG4 and pcDNA3 . 1 ) were seeded at a density of 10 6 cssionells / 100 - mm dish in RPMI - 1640 medium with 10 % FBS for 48 hr . Then cells were washed with ice - cold PBS , harvested and ﬁxed in 70 % ethanol for 30 minutes . Cells were treated with RNase A and stained with 25 l g / ml propi - dium iodide ( PI ) .

Survival curve was obtained by the Kaplan - Meier method . Overall survival of patients with low versus high ECRG4 expression was analyzed using the log - rank test . Mul - tivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was per - formed with overall survival as the response variable . To verify the proportional hazards model assumption , we tested the hazard ratios for covariates changed with time ( including age , gender , grade , ECRG4 expression , primary tumor size , regional lymph node and tumor stage ) . p < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . Results ECRG4 protein expression was downregulated in ESCC Our previous study revealed that ECRG4 mRNA level was downregulated or undetectable in ESCC tissues and cell lines . 8 In this study , after the anti - ECRG4 polyclonal antibody was produced , the speciﬁcity of the antibody for the puriﬁed ECRG4 protein was tested by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay and western blot analysis ( Figs . 1 a and 1 b ) . We further evaluated the ECRG4 protein level in ESCC tissues and cell lines by Western blot . The result demonstrated that ECRG4 protein expression level was downregulated in 3 of 4 ESCC tumor samples , compared with adjacent normal tissues ( Fig . 1 c ) . All 3 ESCC cell lines ( NEC , EC109 and EC9706 ) showed no detectable ECRG4 protein expression ( data not shown ) . Then ECRG4 protein expression level was examined by ESCC tissue microarray immunohistochemical staining . We found that normal esophageal epithelia showed moderately or strong positive staining , yet cancer tissues demonstrated negative or weak immunoreactions ( Fig . 1 d ) . Totally , 89 of 130 ( 68 . 5 % ) ESCC specimens studied exhibited reduced ECRG4 protein expression . The ECRG4 protein was predominantly found in the cytoplasm and cell membrane .

There were signiﬁcant correlations between low ECRG4 protein expres - sion and primary tumor size , regional lymph node metastasis and clinicopathologic stage in ESCC ( Table I ) .

Promoter hypermethylation and ECRG4 transcriptional inactivation The expression of tumor suppressor gene is often downregu - lated in cancer tissues due to the hypermethylation in the gene promoter . Our previous study demonstrated that ECRG4 mRNA level was downregulated in ESCC accompanied with gene pro - moter hypermethylation . 8 In this study , we further treated ESCC cells with demethylation drug 5 - aza - 2 0 - deoxycytidine and found that demethylation treatment restored ECRG4 mRNA expression ( Fig . 2 ) .

ECRG4 protein expression and survival of ESCC patients After follow - up of total 73 ESCC patients , association between ECRG4 protein expression and overall survival was determined by using the log - rank test and multivariable Cox proportional haz - ards regression analysis . ESCC patients with high ECRG4 protein expression had survived longer than those with low ECRG4 pro - tein expression ( Fig . 3 ) , as shown by Kaplan - Meier survival analy - sis and log - rank test ( p 5 0 . 013 ) . Univariate analysis indicated that ECRG4 protein expression level and regional lymph node me - tastasis were statistically signiﬁcant prognostic factors ( Table II ) . Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indi - cated that ECRG4 protein expression was an independent prog - nostic factor for ESCC ( ESCC patients with high versus low ECRG4 expression , hazard ratio 5 0 . 115 , 95 % CI 5 0 . 014 – 0 . 917 , p 5 0 . 041 ; Table III ) . ECRG4 expression inhibited cell proliferation , colony formation , and anchorage - independent growth in soft agar Then we examined tumor - suppressing function of ECRG4 in vitro . The stable - transfected EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRG4 cells exhibited detectable protein expression compared with EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 cells ( Fig . 4 a ) . We observed that EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRG4 cells proliferated more slowly than EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 control group , as shown by MTT assay ( Fig . 4 b ) . After 2 week’s culture , EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRG4 group formed colonies smaller in size and fewer in number than EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 con - F IGURE 4 – C ONTINUED 1510 LI ET AL . trol group in both colony formation experiment ( Fig . 4 c ) and soft agar assay ( Fig . 4 d ) . ECRG4 expression suppressed tumor growth in vivo We further evaluated the effect of ECRG4 expression on tumor growth in vivo . EC976 / pcDNA3 . 1 and EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRG4 cells were subcutaneously injected into athymic nude mice ( 8 mice per group ) , respectively . When the mice were sacri - ﬁced 3 weeks after injection , the tumor weights of EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 control group were heavier than those of EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRG4 group ( p < 0 . 01 ; Fig . 4 e ) . Although both groups developed tumors when sacriﬁced , the formed tumors from EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 control group grew faster than those from EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRG4 group ( Fig . 4 f ) . ECRG4 expression blocked cell cycle progression Cell cycle examination was carried out by ﬂow cytometric anal - ysis in an attempt to explore the mechanism of growth - suppressing function of ECRG4 . The result suggested that ECRG4 expression could arrest ESCC cells at the G 1 - S checkpoint and delay cell cycle into S phase ( Fig . 4 g ) . Consequently , induced ECRG4 expression slowed down cell cycle progression and caused cell cycle G 1 arrest . ECRG4 may be involved in NF - j B pathway In exploring the molecular mechanism of ECRG4 tumor - sup - pressing function in ESCC , we found that restoration of ECRG4 expression in ESCC cells inhibited NF - j B expression and nuclear translocation and attenuated NF - j B target gene COX - 2 expression ( Fig . 5 ) . It indicated that ECRG4 may be involved in NF - j B path - way in ESCC . ECRG4 might induce COX - 2 downregulation through NF - j B pathway to inhibit tumor growth in ESCC . Discussion ECRG4 is a new gene cloned and identiﬁed in our laboratory , 5 , 6 and its biological function is still unclear . ECRG4 is highly con - served among various species , suggesting an important role for ECRG4 in eukaryotic cells . In our study , ECRG4 expression was downregulated in ESCC with promoter hypermethylation and deme - thylation treatment restored ECRG4 mRNA expression in ESCC cells . There were signiﬁcant correlations between ECRG4 expression downregulation and primary tumor size , regional lymph node metas - tasis and clinicopathologic stage in ESCC . ECRG4 high expression was associated with prolonged overall survival of ESCC patients ; res - toration of ECRG4 expression in ESCC cells inhibited cell prolifera - tion , colony formation , anchorage - independent growth in soft agar , cell cycle progression and tumor growth in vivo . Collectively , these results supported the idea that ECRG4 is a candidate tumor suppres - sor gene in ESCC and indicated that loss of ECRG4 function may play an important role in ESCC carcinogenesis . ESCC is a heterogeneous disease , thus , ESCC patients with similar clinical - pathologic features often have different prognostic outcomes . Consequently , it is urgently needed to identify those ESCC patients who are at high risk of treatment failure or recur - rence years later after surgical resection of tumor . However , the current clinical staging systems for ESCC have limitations in pre - dicting clinical prognosis . So , new prognostic markers will have important clinical implications in identifying ESCC patients at high risk of postsurgical recurrence or predicting the survival of ESCC patients . These speciﬁc prognostic molecular biomarkers for ESCC are particularly noteworthy in this regard for the clini - cians to evaluate patients and decide individually the best therapy plan . In our study , ESCC patients with high ECRG4 expression had survived longer than those with low ECRG4 expression . Moreover , ECRG4 protein was an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients in China . We speculate that ESCC with low ECRG4 expression may have growth advantage with a higher pro - liferative capability , which leads to poor prognosis . Consistent with our ﬁndings , Mori et al . 13 found that ECRG4 mRNA expres - sion level could also be a candidate prognostic factor for ESCC patients in Japan . Their work strongly supports our ﬁndings in Chinese population . In summary , the clinicians may individually select those ESCC patients with high risk of cancer recurrence for adjuvant therapy by utilizing ECRG4 alone or combined with other markers to improve the prognosis of high - risk patients and spare the low - risk patients from unnecessary overtreatment . In future , further studies are required to validate the clinical utility of ECRG4 protein as biomarker for ESCC prognosis . The downregulation of ECRG4 protein in ESCC could be caused by decreased stability of the protein due to mutation or reduced transcription of the gene and loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) or epigenetic mechanisms . In this study , we found no so - matic mutation in the coding region of ECRG4 gene through F IGURE 5 – ECRG4 may be involved in NF - j B pathway . ( a ) Analy - sis of cell’s total proteins by Western blot showed that NF - j B subunit p65 and NF - j B target gene COX - 2 expression were decreased in EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRG4 cells compared with EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 cells . No detectable difference in I j B a expression was seen between 2 groups . ( b ) Analysis of nuclear proteins by Western blot indicated that nuclear translocation of NF - j B subunit p65 was reduced in EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 - ECRG4 cells compared with EC9706 / pcDNA3 . 1 cells .

Moreover , no LOH locus has been reported at 2q1 in ESCC . 9 , 14 , 15 A growing body of evidence has indicated that in addition to mutational inactivation or deletion of tumor suppressor genes , epi - genetic gene silencing plays a signiﬁcant role in carcinogenesis of various human cancers . 16 – 19 Epigenetic events , which are impor - tant in normal cellular functions , are also critical factors during initiation and progression of cancer . 20 , 21 Although genetic abnor - malities in several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes fre - quently occur in tumorigenesis , 22 – 24 our previous study showed that ECRG4 mRNA was downregulated with gene promoter hy - permethylation in ESCC . 8 Tumor suppressor genes such as p14 , p15 , p16 , FHIT , CDH1 , MGMT , VHL , RASSF1A and E - cadherin are usually downregulated by gene promoter hypermethylation in ESCC . 22 , 25 – 29 In this study , we further discovered that the silenc - ing of ECRG4 was reversed by pharmacologic demethylation treatment in ESCC cells . This indicated that promoter hypermeth - ylation could be 1 of the reasons leading to the loss of ECRG4 expression in ESCC . Cell cycle analysis indicated that ECRG4 might act as a tumor suppressor gene in ESCC by inhibiting tumor cells growth through inducing cell cycle G 1 phase arrest . However , the detailed molecular mechanisms still remain unclear . ECRG4 is highly expressed in cer - tain inﬂammation and immune related diseases , 7 and it has high homology with mouse IgG . It appeared plausible that ECRG4 might play a role in tumor inﬂammation response in ESCC . It is now gen - erally accepted that NF - j B pathway plays a central role between inﬂammation and carcinogenesis , 30 – 32 and COX - 2 is 1 target gene of transcription factor NF - j B . 33 We speculated ECRG4 might be involved in NF - j B pathway in ESCC . Consistent with this hypo - thesis , our study revealed that restoration of ECRG4 expression in ESCC cells attenuated NF - j B expression and nuclear transloca - tion and reduced NF - j B target gene COX - 2 expression . Inhibition of NF - j B pathway within malignant cells could induce tumor regression . 34 Tumor suppressor ING4 suppressed brain tumor growth through NF - j B and COX - 2 pathway . 35 ECRG4 might induce COX - 2 downregulation through NF - j B pathway to inhibit tumor growth in ESCC . However , further investigation is necessary to determine the exact role played by ECRG4 in NF - j B pathway in ESCC . Taken together , ECRG4 is a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene in ESCC , and ECRG4 protein is a candidate prognostic bio - marker for ESCC .
