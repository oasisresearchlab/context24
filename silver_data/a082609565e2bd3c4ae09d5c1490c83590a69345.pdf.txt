USA Vol . 73 , No . 4 , pp . 1255 - 1259 , April 1976 Cell Biology Clathrin : A unique protein associated with intracellular transfer of membrane by coated vesicles ( brain / adrenal medulla / lymphoma cells / peptide mapping ) BARBARA M . F . PEARSE Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Hills Road , Cambridge CB2 2QH , England Communicated by F . Sanger , January 15 , 1976 ABSTRACT Coated vesicles have been purified from brain , adrenal medulla , and a nonsecreting Iymphoma cell line . A single major protein species , clathrin , with an appar - ent molecular weight of 180 , 000 , forms the coat of all these vesicles . Peptide mapping suggests that the amino acid se - quence of clathrin is conserved , irrespective of tissue or species studied . Coated vesicles of different sizes are found . The coats are constructed with variable numbers of clathrin subunits , arranged in closed networks of hexagons and penta - gons . The amount of clathrin in Iymphoma cells suggests that coated vesicles transfer substantial amounts of membrane within cells , not necessarily in association with a secretory process . Transfer of material between the different membranous or - ganelles of cells - the endoplasmic reticulum , Golgi appara - tus , specialized vacuoles , and plasma membrane - is be - lieved to be mediated by various type of vesicles ( 1 - 3 ) . One such class , known as " coated vesicles , " has been observed by electron microscopy in many different cells . These vesicles are remarkable for the lattice - like coats they have on their cytoplasmic surfaces . The biological role of coated vesicles seems to vary depending on the functions of the cell type . In the frog neuromuscular junction , the vesicles have been shown to resorb membrane from the presynaptic membrane for re - use , after secretion of acetylcholine by synaptic ves - icles ( 4 ) . In other cells , whose function is to absorb material , coated vesicles are believed to form from the plasma mem - brane , thereby endocytosing extracellular protein ( 5 , 6 ) . This type of vesicle also appears to transport noncytoplasmic en - zymes from the Golgi apparatus to their sites of action ( 6 , 7 ) . Having developed a procedure for the purification of coated vesicles from pig brain ( 8 ) , I found that their coats consisted essentially of a single protein with an apparent molecular weight of 180 , 000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electropho - resis . I named the protein " clathrin " to indicate the lattice - like structures which it forms . I have now purified coated vesicles from a different source , the adrenal medulla ( a se - cretory tissue ) of bullocks , and compared the major protein of these vesicles with clathrins from coated vesicles of bul - lock brain and pig brain . I have also isolated coated vesicles from a nonsecreting mouse lymphoma cell line , E . L . 4 . ( 9 ) . The major proteins from each of these different coated vesi - cle preparations are similar : this is shown by one - dimension - al fractionation of peptide fragments , obtained by chemical cleavage of these proteins , on 15 % sodium dodecyl sulfate / polyacrylamide gels . MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of Coated Vesicles from Different Sources . Pig and bullock brains and bullock adrenal medullas were Abbreviation : NaDodSO4 , sodium dodecyl sulfate . 1255 obtained from Garnham and Sons , Coldhams Lane , Cam - bridge , England . Homogenates of the different tissues were prepared essentially as described for pig brains ( 8 ) , using buffer solution containing 0 . 1 M MES [ 2 - ( N - morpholi - no ) ethane sulfonic acid ] pH 6 . 5 , 1 mM ethylene glycol - bis ( f - aminoethyl ether ) - NN ' - tetraacetic acid , 0 . 5 mM MgCl2 , and 0 . 02 % sodium azide . Cells of a lymphoma line , E . L . 4 ( 9 ) , were grown as ascites tumors in 20 mice [ strain B1O ( H - 2b ) ] for 12 days . This line was shown to be a nonsecretor since , when grown for one generation in vitro on L - [ 14Cjphenylalanine , less than 1 % of the total labelled protein was found in the medium . Ascites cells were harvested by centrifugation , resuspended in an equal volume of ice - cold preparation buffer , and lysed and homogenized in a Sorvall Omnimixer at full speed for 3 X 30 sec intervals . Homogenates were centrifuged at 20 , 000 X g for 30 min to remove debris , and then at 55 , 000 X g for 1 hr to obtain crude coated vesicles . These were further purified by three sucrose gradient centrifugation steps ( 8 ) . Purification was monitored with the electron microscope . A drop of sample was placed on a carbon coated grid , negatively stained with 1 % uranyl acetate ( 10 ) , air dried , and examined in a Philips EM 300 microscope . Particles shown here were photo - graphed either on the carbon film or suspended in stain over holes in the carbon film . Sodium dodecyl sulfate ( NaDodSO4 ) / polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as before ( 8 , 11 ) . For speed of monitoring samples during the purification , a micro - slab gel electrophoresis apparatus was used ( 12 ) . Protein Chemistry . For the following procedures protein from the coated vesicles was first separated from lipid by precipitation in chloroform : methanol : 0 . 1 M sodium acetate , at pH 4 . 0 ( 1 : 2 . 2 : 1 , vol / vol ) and pelleted by centrifugation ( 13 ) . Carboxymethylation of the reduced protein was carried out , using iodoacetate , in 6 . 0 M guanidinium hydrochloride , at pH 8 . 0 . Samples of the carboxymethylated protein were hydrolyzed in 6 M HCI containing 0 . 1 % phenol at 105Â° , for 24 , 48 , and 72 hr , respectively , and analyzed for amino acids and amino sugars on a Durrum amino acid analyzer , D - 500 . Average values over the time course were taken , except for serine and threonine - which were extrapolated to zero time , and for isoleucine and leucine - where the averages of the 48 hr and 72 hr values were used . Tryptophan was estimated by the method of Edelhoch ( 14 ) . For cyanogen bromide cleavage , protein was dissolved in 70 % formic acid and reacted with excess cyanogen bromide , overnight at room temperature . The resultant solution was diluted 5 - to 40 - fold with water and freeze dried . Samples were then examined by electrophoresis on 15 % NaDodSO4 / polyacrylamide gels . Proc . Nat . Acad . Sci .

After desalting , samples were examined by electrophore - sis on 15 % NaDodSO4 / polyacrylamide gels . Lipid Estimation . Phospholipids were extracted and esti - mated as before ( 8 ) .

Coated vesicles were isolated in yields of approxi - mately 30 % from pig and bullock brains , 3 - 4 mg being ob - tained from 100 g wet weight of brain . About 1 . 5 mg was purified from 100 g of adrenal medulla and 0 . 5 mg from 15 g of lymphoma cells . Electron micrographs of samples from these different sources all show the same striking lattice - coated structures but with different size distributions ( Fig . 1 ) .

About 12 distinct bands are visible for each sample , while 39 peptides would be expected from cleavage at the 38 methionine resi - dues in the coated vesicle proteins . However , short peptides would run at the buffer front and therefore not contribute to the number observed . Some of the larger fragments may represent partially cleaved products . The uncleaved protein does not enter the 15 % gels used for these comparisons . Apart from a few differences , clathrins from various sources show peptide bands which are similar in number and mobil - ity . These gel patterns are not complete protein maps , but they are sufficiently detailed to suggest similar amino acid sequences . 0 , ; . : . , fj : : , ! 4 - - , 4 v i , . f .

The maps are more complete and confirm the similarity of the proteins re - vealed by cyanogen bromide cleavage . About the correct number of peptides expected from the number of cysteine residues in the brain proteins was obtained . The patterns of bands given by the different samples are similar in number , position and relative intensity . Lipid Composition . The lipid composition of bullock brain coated vesicles was found to be phosphatidyl choline 42 % , phosphatidyl ethanolamine 33 % , phosphatidyl serine 4 % , sphingomyelin 8 % , and phosphatidyl inositides 10 % . This is similar to that determined previously for pig brain coated vesicles ( 8 ) . The molar ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid was esti - mated to be about 0 . 1 in brain coated vesicles and 0 . 3 in those from adrenal medulla . DISCUSSION The purification procedure described ( 8 ) for pig brain coat - ed vesicles is a general one which has been applied success - fully to other tissues and cells . All the coated vesicles studied , whether from brain , adrenal medulla , liver , a lymphoma cell line , or Krebs ascites cells , are characterized by a single major protein , having an apparent molecular weight of 180 , 000 , on NaDodSO4 / gel electrophoresis . When the pro - teins isolated from pure coated vesicles from different sources are analyzed , their amino acid compositions seem fairly invariant . More striking are the fragments obtained by chemical cleavage at methionine or cysteine residues : the one - dimensional maps of the protein are remarkably con - stant , irrespective of either tissue or species , which indicates that the major protein of all these coated vesicles , clathrin , may contain a highly conserved amino acid sequence . By contrast , similar techniques applied to myosin heavy chains ( which have a similar molecular weight , 200 , 000 ) give pat - 1258 Cell Biology : Pearse Proc . Nat . Acad . Sci . USA 73 ( 1976 ) 1259 terns characteristic of the tissues from which they were iso - lated ( 17 , 18 ) . The absence of amino sugars in clathrin suggests that carbohydrate is lacking . This would be expect - ed of a cytoplasmic protein which can associate with , and dissociate from , membranes in a cyclic fashion , if one func - tion of covalently bound carbohydrate is to " lock " protein irreversibly into a membrane ( 19 ) . The low level of choles - terol associated with the phospholipids is closer to that of in - ternal membranes than that of the plasma membrane ( 20 ) . Coated vesicles transfer membrane from one membranous organelle to another within the cell . Since different organ - elles are believed to contain different proteins and different proportions of lipids , some form of control must exist to en - sure that the compositions of the donor and receptor mem - branes are not randomized during transfer . The specificity involved here is likely to occur during the formation of the coated vesicles . The coated vesicles from a given tissue are not homoge - neous : the size of the particles is not uniform and some of the coats appear to be empty . In those from pig brain ( 23 ) the clathrin subunits form a closed network of hexagons and pentagons . The arrangement of clathrin in the most usual size of coat ( having 108 subunits ) is also not unique - at least two different species exist . Larger coats , which again are closed networks , are found in pig brain preparations but are more abundant in those from adrenal medulla and lympho - ma cells . The finding that the same protein covers large and small vesicles , coupled with the observation that large coated vesicles have a different function from smaller ones in rat vas deferens ( 6 ) , suggests that the size of coat around a vesi - cle is not determined by clathrin itself . Specific transfer of membrane from one location to another within a cell must involve specific recognition and therefore other proteins : it is presumably these other factors which determine what size the coated vesicle should be . Coated vesicles do not appear to have one simple function common to all cells . They have been seen most frequently in cells which are involved in secretory or absorption processes - for example , in nerve cells ( 21 , 22 ) , pancreatic exocrine cells ( 7 ) , the developing oocyte of the mosquito ( 5 ) , and rat vas deferens epithelium ( 6 ) . They are involved in resorption of plasma membrane ( 4 ) , ingestion of extracellular protein , which is accompanied by resorption of plasma membrane ( 5 , 6 ) and in less clear functions with the Golgi apparatus ( 6 , 7 ) . The finding that coated vesicles can be isolated from nonsecreting lymphoma cells in amounts comparable to those found in brain or adrenal medulla , suggests that their existence may be much more widespread than suspected . From the quantity of clathrin isolated from lymphoma cells , the number of coated vesicles in each cell can be estimated . Assuming a recovery of about one third of the vesicles dur - ing purification , there must be a few thousand of the larger ones per lymphoma cell , enough to transfer substantial amounts of membrane within the cell .
