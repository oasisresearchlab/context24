Spakowitz bc and Nicholas A . Melosh * ac Clathrin is a three - legged protein complex that assembles into lattice structures on the cell membrane and transforms into fullerene - like cages during endocytosis . This dynamic structural ﬂ exibility makes clathrin an attractive building block for guided assembly . The assembly dynamics and the mechanical properties of clathrin protein lattices are studied using rheological measurements and theoretical modelling in an e ﬀ ort to better understand two dynamic processes : protein adsorption to the interface and assembly into a network . We ﬁ nd that percolation models for protein network formation are insu ﬃ cient to describe clathrin network formation , but with Monte Carlo simulations we can describe the dynamics of network formation very well . Insights from this work can be used to design new bio - inspired nano - assembly systems . Introduction Nature creates a remarkable array of functional nanostructured architectures through self - and guided - assembly . The  delity inherent in biological assembly is attractive for a broad range of applications , including inorganic / organic materials based on biopolymer assemblies composed of DNA , 1 – 4 proteins , 5 – 8 bacte - rial membranes , 9 – 12 and virus particles . 13 – 21 Clathrin proteins are a fascinating system for examining biological assembly since these  exible units can adopt diverse structures ranging from 2 - dimensional hexagonal arrays 22 to 3 - dimensional shell - like structures . 23 – 25 Clathrin is a major player in endocytosis and exhibits highly dynamic behaviour within the cell , which potentially could be harnessed to create mate - rials with temporally tunable properties . The variety of nano - structures possible from this single subunit also makes it an ideal system to study the kinetic and thermodynamic driving forces that lead to assembly of speci  c nanoscale structures . Dynamic control over assembly and reorganization could potentially be extended to localized regions or vary over time , opening the door for a new class of biotemplate engineered structures featuring tunable designs and active functionalities . Characterization of clathrin protein  exibility 26 , 27 and cage assembly 28 , 29 has been examined with optical 26 , 27 and X - ray 30 techniques . However , large area clathrin networks have proven more di ﬃ cult to study . Spanning 2 - dimensional clathrin assemblies are formed in vivo on the cell membrane surface in the early steps of endocytosis . 31 In vitro , similar 2 - dimensional network formation can be recreated on lipid monolayers at air – water interfaces , and have been observed using transmission electron microscopy . 22 , 32 However , these static measurements miss the rich kinetics of clathrin absorption , recruitment , and assembly , which have recently proven more dynamic than previously thought . 33 While clathrin network assembly is complex , two of the critical steps are : ( 1 ) individual clathrin triskeles binding to PIP 2 ( phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ) lipids via an adaptor protein , 34 and ( 2 ) protein migration and self - association to form the hexagonal network . During large area network formation , these two steps largely occur simultaneously . Therefore , in order to properly study clathrin network assembly one must be able to separately measure and quantify both clathrin adsorp - tion and organization . Further environmental factors such as protein concentration , pH , and salt concentration must also be controlled . 28 Mechanical measurements are an e ﬀ ective means of moni - toring such network formation in situ , as the surface pressure and mechanical modulus are highly sensitive to the number density and intermolecular attachment of the individual units , respectively . Surface rheological techniques have been used to monitor protein assemblies at air – water interfaces , and have the potential to distinguish between di ﬀ erent degrees of orga - nization and defect density within the network with appropriate modelling .

These results reveal that traditional percolation models are insu ﬃ cient to describe clathrin networks , but a Brownian dynamics model accounting for molecular properties describes network growth well . Greater understanding of clathrin assembly under various conditions may allow better shape and kinetic control , o ﬀ ering a new and powerful platform for engi - neering nano - assembly systems . Results and discussion Network formation was measured from the mechanical prop - erties of clathrin assembling onto a lipid monolayer at an air – water interface using interfacial shear rheometry ( ISR ) . ISR is simultaneously sensitive to two di ﬀ erent surface properties , the surface pressure ( N m (cid:1) 1 ) and surface modulus ( N m (cid:1) 1 ) , which relate to the concentration of clathrin on the lipid and the degree of clathrin crosslinking , respectively . Through modeling , the measurements can be separated into these individual components , allowing a clear view into the steps of network formation . Experiments were conducted with a Langmuir monolayer of lipids as a model for the cytosolic cell membrane surface . 35 Using a Langmuir – Blodgett trough or a Te  on dish , a mixture of lipids and cholesterol meant to approximate a cell membrane ( 20 % PIP 2 , 35 % SOPC , 35 % SOPE , and 10 % cholesterol ) were dissolved in solvent ( 0 . 1 mg ml (cid:1) 1 in chloroform – methanol – water at 20 : 9 : 1 v / v ) and spread on a bu ﬀ ered subphase ( HKM bu ﬀ er , 25 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 125 mM potassium acetate , 5 mM magnesium acetate , 1 mM dithiothreitol ) , in accordance with protocols previously described elsewhere . 32 Lipids were spread dilutely onto the liquid surface on the Langmuir trough , and compressed to an initial surface pressure of 10 mN m (cid:1) 1 . Experiments were performed at constant surface area . A  er the lipids reached a stable surface pressure ( little or no surface pressure dri  ) , clathrin molecules ( (cid:3) 1 mg ml (cid:1) 1 plus associated adaptor proteins in HKM bu ﬀ er ) were injected into the subphase . These clathrin proteins were derived from bovine clathrin coated vesicles , and included their associated adaptor proteins . The subphase was stirred gently to promote clathrin motion without perturbing the lipid surface , increasing binding kinetics and minimizing experimental dri  . A  er injecting a mixture of clathrin and adaptor protein into the subphase , the proteins begin binding to the PIP 2 lipids in the monolayer , increasing both the surface pressure and surface modulus . The surface pressure was measured using a Wilhelmy plate of either  lter paper or platinum , while the surface modulus was measured with an ISR . The ISR consisted of a Langmuir – Blodgett trough with a pair of Helmholtz coils and a camera as previously described . 36 , 37 A magnetized needle , placed at the air – water interface , was oscillated back and forth using a magnetic  eld , while the movement of the needle was recorded with the camera . By observing the magnitude and phase of the needle oscillation in relation to the magnetic  eld oscillation the surface moduli of the interface can be determined . The needle oscillates in an open - ended glass channel , which creates well de  ned shear  elds , and makes the data obtained fully quantitative . Unless otherwise speci  ed , the ISR probing frequency and magnitude was 0 . 1 Hz and 0 . 5 % strain , respectively . The surface pressure of the lipid surface increased as a function of clathrin concentration in the subphase , Fig . 1 . Protein binding to a lipid monolayer increases the surface pressure in proportion to the concentration of bound protein . 38 This can be described by a Langmuir adsorption isotherm for ideal binding , or the Hill equation for molecules which undergo cooperative binding , such as clathrin . Fitting a Hill equation to our data yields a disassociation constant for the clathrin – lipid interaction , which was found to be 1 . 6 (cid:4) 10 (cid:1) 10 M , a typical value for protein – ligand interactions , and a Hill coe ﬃ cient of n ¼ 1 . 5 ( Fig . 1 ) . This shows positive cooperative binding , but the Hill coe ﬃ cients derived in our study were consistently smaller than others found for clathrin assembly in vivo ( n (cid:3) 3 ) . 39 However , since Hill coe ﬃ cients are very sensitive to pH , salt , and temperature , variation between the in vivo and in vitro conditions may lead to di ﬀ erent coe ﬃ cients . Additionally , as our in vitro environment contains only lipids , clathrin , and adaptor proteins , it is also possible that our experiment lacks some biological species that would synergistically increase the cooperative magnitude of binding . 39 As the surface concentration of clathrin triskelia increases , they will begin to attach to each other and form 2 - D protein networks . As these networks grow larger and more inter - connected , the surface modulus of the Langmuir  lm increases . Fig . 2 shows the elastic storage modulus as a function of time a  er injection of 100 nM of clathrin into the subphase . The modulus increases monotonically over 4 hours , a  er which evaporation and oxidative e ﬀ ects degrade the experiment . Cla - thrin injected under a lipid layer without the clathrin - binding lipid PIP 2 does not increase the surface modulus ( Fig . 2 ) , demonstrating that the increase in surface modulus is not due to non - speci  c protein adsorption or interaction , but rather speci  c clathrin – lipid binding . In order to minimize the e ﬀ ect of the lipids on the surface modulus , we used only unsaturated lipids with a transition temperature below 20 (cid:5) C ( SOPC , 1 - octadecanoyl - 2 - ( 9 Z - octade - cenoyl ) - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine , and SOPE , 1 - octadecanoyl - 2 - ( 9 Z - octadecenoyl ) - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ) . This prevents a lipid gel phase , which exhibits both a higher Fig . 1 Clathrin – lipid binding a ﬃ nity upon serial injection of clathrin into the subphase .

Furthermore , unsaturated lipids prevented phase separation of the PIP 2 , ensuring a homogenous lipid monolayer . 40 Fig . 3 shows the rise in surface modulus for a pure lipid monolayer during compression ( pressure - area isotherm ) , and during clathrin binding ( constant surface area ) . Clathrin binding alone causes the surface pressure to rise to almost 15 mN m (cid:1) 1 . Over this surface pressure range the modulus of the pure lipid  lm increased slightly above 10 mN m (cid:1) 1 ( Fig . 3 ) . This small increase indicated the increased modulus is almost entirely ( > 97 % ) from the clathrin network , and the lipid component is neglected in the remainder of the paper . Even without forming well - ordered , spanning networks , the surface adsorption of surface active polymers is known to require a critical concentration before inducing moduli changes . 41 This produces a modulus increase behaviour similar to percolation network formation . However , this is not due to bonding between polymer clusters , but due to packing e ﬀ ects . Isolated , non - interacting clusters can also increase the surface moduli , but only at high frequencies . 42 At lower frequencies , the clusters can rearrange themselves quickly enough to dissipate any energy that would a ﬀ ect a modulus increase . Only as the clusters begin to pack against each other do changes occur in the low frequency or quasi - static moduli . We do see some evidence of these changes during network formation and growth , as the modulus seems to grow a little faster when measured at higher frequencies ( Fig . S1 † ) . Because of these possible artifacts , we measured network formation at very low frequencies ( 0 . 1 Hz ) , ensuring that the measured modulus increase was from the formation of stable , long - term bond formation between smaller networks , and not from transient connections . The use of slow , quasi - static , measurements also allowed for better comparison to conventional elastic modulus data . Once the network is well - formed , the modulus was invariant with measurement frequency ( Fig . S2 † ) , which is consistent with a temporally robust network with stable bonds . In sum , these data show that the clathrin binding to the lipid surface greatly increases the surface modulus , and does so in a manner suggesting a percolation network . Furthermore , the network structure is dominated by stable bond formation between clusters , and not simply by packing e ﬀ ects . However , the nature of clathrin network is unclear at this point . A true percolation network assumes non - interacting species and random site occupancy , while previous work shows that local - ized clathrin recruitment coordination 39 and surface clustering occurs . 22 , 32 In order to better understand the nature of clathrin network interaction , we developed two models to compare against the experimental data , one based on a random percolation network , and the other based on a combined Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulation that accounts for clathrin clustering with molecular di ﬀ usion , binding , and unbinding events . In the  rst percolation model , changes in moduli at low , quasi - static frequencies can only occur when site occupancy rises above a critical threshold . The mechanical strength of a network above the critical percolation concentration increases following a power law relation . 43 From this relation , we can estimate the shear strength of a percolation network at site occupancy values above the percolation threshold as : G ¼ G max A ( r (cid:1) r c ) b , ( 1 ) where A and b are 8 . 38 and 1 . 98 , respectively , for hexagonal bond networks in shear , 44 with a critical percolation density , r c , for a hexagonal bond network of 0 . 6527 . 45 Here G max is the shear modulus of a perfect hexagonal network , and r is the site occupancy . Site occupancy was determined from the rise in surface pressure a  er protein injection , and surface modulus measured using ISR . For the ISR experiments , the lipid monolayer was spread on the liquid surface and compressed to 10 mN m (cid:1) 1 . Then an excess of clathrin ( 1 mM ) and adaptor proteins were injected into the subphase and gently mixed continuously with a peri - staltic pump . Within a few minutes of protein injection , the surface pressure began to rise , while the surface modulus did not begin to increase for almost an additional hour ( Fig . 4a ) , indicating protein adsorption but without formation of a percolating path . Adapting eqn ( 1 ) for ISR experiments results in G total ¼ G lipids þ G clathrin " A (cid:2) Dp Dp max (cid:1) r c (cid:3) b # ( 2 ) in this equation , A , b , and r c are mathematically derived percolation constants , and remain unchanged from eqn ( 1 ) . D p Fig . 2 Only lipid monolayer ﬁ lms with PIP 2 show a modulus increase after clathrin is injected into the subphase . Fig . 3 The surface modulus of a lipid ﬁ lm with bound clathrin proteins is much larger than that of lipid only ﬁ lms at comparable surface pressures .

View Article Online is the rise in surface pressure a  er protein injection ( Fig . 4a , orange line ) , and D p max is the estimated rise in surface pressure if the experiment was allowed to proceed inde  nitely . This value is estimated by  tting a double exponential to the surface pressure data and is estimated to be 12 . 25 mN m (cid:1) 1 . We assume this value represents complete site occupancy , as compared to previous work 32 we used an excess of PIP 2 in the monolayer and injected an excess of protein into the subphase . Therefore , we used D p / D p max to represent the site occupancy . The shear modulus for a lipid only interface , G lipids , is approximately zero ( Fig . 3 ) , and was neglected . G clathrin is the shear modulus of a perfect clathrin network , which was not able to be accurately estimated from the ISR data ( Fig . 4 , blue dots ) . Attempts to estimate G clathrin by  tting curves to contiguous parts of the data suggest a possible range for the maximum modulus between 2 . 3 and 3 . 3 mN m (cid:1) 1 . We used 2 . 5 mN m (cid:1) 1 in Fig . 4 ( black line ) , consistent with our hybrid Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulation results . The e ﬀ ects other values of G clathrin have on the percolation model are shown in Fig . S3 , † but they do not change the general shape or trend of the model , and thus do not a ﬀ ect any of our analyses or conclusions . The results of this analysis are shown in Fig . 4 . Below the critical percolation value , the modulus is zero . At p c ( D p (cid:3) 8 mN m (cid:1) 1 ) , the percolation model modulus rises sharply , before approaching the modulus of a perfect network . The data and models plotted in Fig . 4a as a function of time are plotted in Fig . 4b as a function of site occupancy , which is a more conventional way to view percolation data , and plots the simu - lation data against their independent variable . As the simula - tion data have no long - term temporal component , they are positioned on the abscissa in Fig . 4a such that the simulation and rheology data at each timepoint have equal site occupancy . Following clathrin injection , the surface pressure began to rise at the 14 . 5 minute mark ( Fig . 4a ) , while critical site occu - pancy ( 65 . 27 % ) occurs at the 70 minute mark , 55 minutes a  er the lipid surface pressure began to rise . At this point , the percolation model predicts the surface modulus should begin to rise ( Fig . 4a , black ) . However , the ISR data shows the modulus begins to increase at the 61 minute mark ( Fig . 4a , blue dots ) . Although this is only 9 minutes before the percolation model predicted , the site occupancy at this point is calculated to be only 55 % ( Fig . 4b , blue dots ) . However , the most dramatic di ﬀ erence between the percolation model and the empirical ISR data is in the shape and initial behavior of the increasing modulus . The pure percolation model predicts the surface modulus would rise sharply , while ISR data shows a much more gradual increase . The percolation model follows the overall behaviour reasonably , however misses the initial assembly period and the shape . These di ﬀ erences illustrate some short - comings in the percolation model , which makes several simplifying assumptions and does not consider clathrin recruitment , coordination , reorganization , or grain boundaries between clathrin clusters . In order to account for the clathrin assembly details ignored in the pure - percolation model and gain molecular - level insight into the measured modulus , we developed a coarse - grained clathrin model 46 that accounts for molecular  exibility and the dynamics of binding / unbinding of legs within the lattice . We simulate the clathrin lattice in 2 dimensions , ignoring out - of - plane motion that would lead to domes and cages . Assembly at the air – water interface involves interfacial tensions that exceed membrane tensions by several orders of magnitude . Therefore , we assume the out - of - plane motion of the lattice is negligible to the overall structure and mechanical properties . However , our model is amenable to addressing such e ﬀ ects . 47 Using Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulations , this model is capable of predicting large - scale mechanical proper - ties while accounting for rearrangements in the lattice consis - tent with the observed clathrin network properties . Several models have been developed to address a broad range of physical processes involving clathrin . Such models capture the structure of the clathrin triskelion and interactions between triskelia using patchy particles , 48 rigid triskelia with speci  c orientational interactions , 49 rigid triskelia with speci  c orientation interactions and varying pucker angle , 50 and tris - kelia composed of patchy particles with orientational Fig . 4 ( A ) ISR measurements of surface pressure change over time ( orange curve , left axis ) and surface modulus vs . time ( blue dots , right axis ) .

View Article Online interactions and  exibility . 51 , 52 In comparison , our model does not include many of the details in the clathrin representation that were the focus of these studies . Our approach in modeling these experiments is to use the simplest possible model with physical parameters that are set by separate experiments . In so doing , our model has only one  oating parameter that is used to set the maximum storage modulus ( see discussion below ) . The experiments occur over 4 hours in time , which is orders of magnitude larger than can be achieved by typical molecular simulation approaches . Thus , we perform a quasi - equilibrium assessment of the network elastic properties at varying occupancy to provide a bridge between the time - dependent experiments and the equilibrated coverage and network structure . In our model , the clathrin triskelion is described as a three - legged hub ( leg length of 24 nm ) that is capable of forming bonds with neighbouring triskelia . Bond formation occurs with binding a ﬃ nity 3 that captures the favorable interactions between the clathrin protein legs . Bonded legs resist stretch - ing and angles between bonded legs withstand bending deformation , which is captured by harmonic springs with stretching modulus k s and bending modulus k b ( Fig . 5a ) . Equilibrium con  gurations are found using Monte Carlo simulations 53 followed by Brownian dynamics simulations to address the dynamics of assembly and reorganization . 46 A detailed discussion of the bending , stretching , and binding energies is found in Appendix A of ref . 46 . The formulation of the Brownian dynamics simulations incorporates a dynamic Monte Carlo component for binding and unbinding processes which ensures thermodynamic equilibrium in the long - time limit . A single frequency parameter was chosen that is consistent with the local di ﬀ usion time of monomer motion , and is discussed in detail in Appendix B of ref . 46 . These parameters were chosen in a way that allows for quasi - static study of the system . Our computer simulation does not dynamically add clathrin triskelia to the system in a way that mimics adsorption to the lipid monolayer , rather , we preform clathrin assembly at various discrete densities in order to predict the e ﬀ ective storage modulus of clathrin networks at equivalent time points . For a given density the Monte Carlo simulations are initiated from a patch of perfect honeycomb lattice embedded in a periodic simulation box of 648 nm . Each Monte Carlo simula - tion is run for 2 (cid:4) 10 7 steps . The binding a ﬃ nity is set to 3 ¼ 5 . 5 k B T , where k B is Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature . One step of Monte Carlo simulation involves random selection of a pinwheel , moving it to a random position and making or breaking a bond of that pinwheel if possible . The binding and unbinding events are captured by a dynamic Monte Carlo algorithm embedded in the Brownian dynamics simulation . 46 In this approach , the pinwheel orientation is de  ned by its bonds . An unbound pinwheel is assumed to undergo rapid rotational di ﬀ usion in comparison to the time scale of bond formation . This assumption only a ﬀ ects fully unbound pinwheels , which are extremely rare in our simulations . Furthermore , our calculations of the mechanical properties of the lattice are una ﬀ ected by such dynamic issues . A  er each Monte Carlo simulation a Brownian dynamics simulation starting from the  nal Monte Carlo con  guration was performed . For each site occupancy density , the Brownian dynamics simulations were run for a total of 2000 time steps to account for pinwheel rearrangements and reorganizations on the surface . In our Brownian dynamics simulation one time step is equivalent to the di ﬀ usion time for a pinwheel to travel a distance equal to the leg length a . The integration time step is set to D t ¼ 0 . 0001 , which is su ﬃ ciently small to resolve local elastic relaxation processes and ensure stability of the simula - tion . This time step is approximately equal to 40 microseconds in real time , leading to the total simulation time of 80 milli - seconds in real time for each Brownian dynamics simulation a  er the Monte Carlo initialization . The  nal con  guration from the Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulations acts as input to determine the shear Fig . 5 Top panel : pinwheel model overview representing clathrin interactions .

To determine the shear modulus we impose ( i ) a uniform in - plane deformation to the network by applying constant displacement d (cid:3) 0 . 1 a along the edges of the simulation box in the horizontal and vertical directions , and ( ii ) subject the network to uniform extension in the x and y direction separately . A  er  nding the minimum - energy con  guration for each displacement , the minimized energy versus displacements provides a quadratic - order rela - tionship between energy and lattice strains , thus resulting in linear relationships between stresses and strains . The pro - portionality constants in these relationships give the storage and shear moduli . 54 The stretching modulus k s was varied to approximate the modulus magnitude range shown in Fig . 4 , while the bending modulus k b waschosenfromprevious clathrinnetworkstructure data . 46 A good  t is obtained using stretching modulus k B Ta 2 k s ¼ 268 and bending modulus k B T k b ¼ 36 . For each occupancy density , wecalculatedtheshearstoragemodulus ( reddiamonds ) shown in Fig . 4 by averaging over 10 simulations . To determine each of the occupancies the same method was employed for the pure - percolation model , D p / D p max ( eqn ( 2 ) ) . Fig . 4 demonstrates that the pinwheel model is capable of predicting the e ﬀ ective storage modulus of the clathrin network very well . It also illus - trates the onset of an elastic percolating network corresponding to the rise of e ﬀ ective storage modulus followed by saturation of the elastic modulus at the maximum site occupancy . Fig . 5b ( le  to right , top to bottom ) illustrates snapshots obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations a  er 2000 steps for various occupancy densities between r ¼ 0 . 20 and 0 . 98 . In these snapshots , red circles are the hubs of clathrin proteins modeled by the pinwheels , solid black lines are bound legs , dashed blue lines are free ( unbound ) legs , and dashed blue circles indicate free pinwheels which have not bound to any other pinwheel . Bond percolation theory states that above 65 % site occu - pancy for a hexagonal lattice should create a spanning network . This is clearly seen from the snapshot taken at an occupancy density r ¼ 0 . 7 ( Fig . 5b ) , which is slightly above the percolation threshold , demonstrating cluster spanning in both horizontal and vertical directions . The Monte Carlo simulation of depleted networks shows a gradual increase in network modulus , in contrast to the percolation model , but agrees with the experimental ISR data ( Fig . 4 ) . This gradual rise is due to the clustering of clathrin triskelia on the lipid surface into areas of concentrated clathrin density , which also causes the modulus to change slightly below 65 % percolation ( Fig . 4b ) . Below r ¼ 0 . 85 ( Fig . 4b ) , our model predicted the modulus increase to be slightly shallower than was measured . Between r ¼ 0 . 85 – 0 . 90 , however , we predicted a sharper modulus increase than occurred . This transition occurred when the clathrin modulus was rising at its fastest rate . Since our Monte Carlo model does not model dynamic network formation , but only steady - state networks at discrete percolation densities , it is possible that network growth is kinetically limited at this point . Similar networks are also known to require time to age and strengthen , even a  er surface adsorption is  nished . 55 We note that the experimental measurements of dynamic modulus versus frequency ( see Fig . S2 † ) suggest the network is composed of long - lived bonds over three decades on time for a mature lattice , which is consistent with the assembly being solid and una ﬀ ected by major reorganization processes at experimental time scales . Clathrin assembly in solution exhibits complex kinetic pathways for assembly marked by large scale reorganization of aggregates and cages over the course of hours to days . 33 However , these reorganization processes most likely in  uence 3D assembly due to the prevalence of aggregates and cages that arise under these conditions . The pair potentials and binding a ﬃ nities used in the model also a ﬀ ect the shape of the modulus curve , and tuning these parameters could result in a better  t to the ISR data , although these parameters were chosen to match the pattern of clathrin network bond struc - tures formed in vivo , 46 so large alterations could lead to unphysical results . Above r ¼ 0 . 90 the ISR data are no longer smooth and continuous due to the small oscillation amplitudes . This makes it di ﬃ cult to draw strong conclusions about the relationship between the ISR data and the Monte Carlo model , but the general trends continue to match quite well . It is worth noting that the modulus obtained from Monte Carlo model asymp - totically approaches its  nal modulus at very high densities , which contrasts with the pure percolation model ( Fig . 4b ) . In order to remove the kinetic issues associated with network growth , we also monitored clathrin adsorption and network growth during a series of discrete clathrin injections into the subphase , allowing the system to reach equilibrium between each injection . Using this procedure to test clathrin adsorption ( Fig . 1 ) , the  rst injection of protein resulted in the largest surface pressure increase , with each subsequent injection resulting in monotonically smaller surface pressure increases . However , serial clathrin injections do not produce a similar trend in modulus increase ( Fig . 6 , S4 † ) . Rather , increasing cla - thrin concentrations result in a sigmoidal modulus increase , where initial clathrin injections increase the surface modulus very little , additional injections increase it substantially , and further injections again result in small increases . This sequence of small – large – small surface pressure increases is visible in Fig . 6 The rise in surface modulus from serial clathrin injections follows a percolation type pattern . This contrasts with the pattern of surface pressure increase ( Fig . 1 , S4 † ) . Arrows indicate the times of clathrin injection into the subphase . 6224 | Soft Matter , 2014 , 10 , 6219 – 6227 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 Soft Matter Paper P ub li s h e d on 11 J u l y 2014 .

View Article Online Fig . 6 and is indicative of percolation network formation , where a critical surface density is required before a spanning network forms , and a global modulus change occurs . The data from Fig . 1 and 6 are directly compared in Fig . S4 , † where the rise in surface pressure is concave , and the rise in surface modulus is convex . These data demonstrate that kinetic limitations in network growth are not responsible for the percolation - like behaviour of the network modulus increase in Fig . 4 . Although the surface pressure can stabilize a few minutes a  er protein injection , a stable surface modulus can take many hours . Because of this , we were limited to only a few clathrin injections before experimental dri  a ﬀ ected the measurements too strongly . The large modulus variations in the ISR data are common when the clathrin networks gain rigidity , as the network is sensitive to strain , and measuring the network can damage it . Normally , the failure mode of adsorbed bio - interfaces in vitro is the slow desorption or oxidation of the agents . This occurs as a slow , continuous process , similar to the adsorption step . However , the failure mode of these clathrin networks is accompanied by sudden drops in the modulus , which is indicative of mechanical tearing , not protein desorption ( Fig . S5 † ) . Our inability to measure the stable formation of a complete clathrin network is directly related to our need to perturb it in order to measure it . Measuring at 0 . 5 % strain allowed network formation to advance much farther than measuring at 2 % strain before network tearing occurs ( Fig . S5 † ) . Strain sweeps on mature clathrin networks showed that network damage begins at strains approaching 0 . 2 % ( Fig . S6 † ) , below which the data signal is too noisy to be useful . This implies that despite our use of the ISR at its technical limits , we were likely damaging the clathrin network a  er it began to percolate . It is possible that other rheology measurement systems which exert a smaller force over a smaller strain range ( such as particle tracking based micro - rheology ) can extend the range of the rheology measurements presented here . In the absence of proteins that initiate endocytosis , clathrin seems to create large networks on a lipid monolayer , which acts as a cell membrane mimic . These clathrin networks appear to be temporally stable , but tear when exposed to shear strains above (cid:3) 2 % . The formation of the networks can be roughly approximated by simple percolation theory , but accurate modelling requires simulation , due to clathrin recruitment and self - association . Our Monte Carlo simulations seem to accu - rately track the growth of network mechanics , but further work still needs to be done to capture the kinetics of network formation and rearrangement . Conclusions We have demonstrated a method for monitoring the assembly of spanning , 2 - dimensional clathrin lattices on lipid mono - layers stabilized at the air – water interface . We used surface rheological techniques to follow the growth of the protein networks through mechanical changes of the lipid surface as the  lm forms . By using the increase in surface pressure to determine the amount of protein on the surface , and using Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulations to capture the growing strength of the protein network as it forms , we can separate adsorption and network formation . This is the  rst attempt to monitor dynamic 2 - dimensional clathrin network self - assembly , and is a step towards understanding assembly over a large parameter space , eventually developing a phase diagram for structural assembly based on mechanical models . These new insights into protein assembly can aid in the engi - neering of bio - inspired nano - assembly systems . Experimental Materials Lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL ) and all bu ﬀ ers and salts were from Sigma Aldrich . Solvents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich , were of at least ACS grade , and were used without further puri  cation , except for chloroform , which was distilled before use . Clathrin and adaptor proteins were isolated from bovine brain tissue using di ﬀ erential centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography as previously reported . 56 Bovine brain tissue was obtained from Harris Ranch ( Coalinga , CA ) and Innovative - Research ( Novi , MI ) . Lipids were handled only with glass , stainless steel , and PTFE . The subphase was HKM bu ﬀ er ( 25 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 125 mM potassium acetate , 5 mM magnesium acetate , 1 mM dithio - threitol ) and the lipid monolayer was 20 % PIP 2 , 10 % choles - terol , 35 % SOPC , and 35 % SOPE , and was used within one day of being prepared . All experiments were performed in either a cleanroom or a dust exclusion cabinet . Interfacial shear rheology All surface rheology experiments were performed in the lab of Gerry Fuller at Stanford University . Data for Fig . 2 , 6 , S1 , S3 and S4 † was obtained with a du No¨uy ring in conjunction with a custom milled PTFE double couette dish and an ARG2 rheom - eter ( TA Instruments , New Castle , DE ) following techniques and equipment previously developed . 57 The subphase for these experiments was not stirred . Protein injection was done with glass syringes ( Hamilton Company , Reno , NV ) , and a programmable syringe pump ( New Era Pump Systems Inc . , Farmingdale , NY ) . All other surface rheology data was obtained with a custom built Interfacial Shear Rheometer ( ISR ) built on a Langmuir – Blodgett trough ( KSV - NIMA , Finland ) . The trough subphase was mixed with a peristaltic pump . Data for Fig . 1 was obtained with a custom milled Te  on dish with a magnetically stirred subphase . Starting lipid surface pressures ( 10 mN m (cid:1) 1 ) were obtained by depositing the lipids in the gas phase and compressing the surface area for experiments using the ISR ( Fig . 3 , 4 , S2 , S5 , and S6 † ) . For other experimental setups ( Fig . 1 , 2 , 6 , S1 , S3 , and S4 † ) the initial lipid surface pressure was obtained by directly depositing the necessary amount of lipids needed to reach 10 mN m (cid:1) 1 , which was determined through pressure – area isotherm experiments . Protein was injected into the ISR subphase from behind the Langmuir – Blodgett trough barriers , This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 Soft Matter , 2014 , 10 , 6219 – 6227 | 6225 Paper Soft Matter P ub li s h e d on 11 J u l y 2014 .
