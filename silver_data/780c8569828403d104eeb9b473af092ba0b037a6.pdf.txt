However , the structural basis of ESCRT - III polymers stabilizing , constricting and 31 cleaving negatively curved membranes is yet unknown . Here we present cryo electron microscopy 32 structures of membrane - coated CHMP2A - CHMP3 filaments of two different diameters at 3 . 3 and 33 3 . 6 Å resolution . The structures reveal helical filaments assembled by CHMP2A - CHMP3 34 heterodimers in the open ESCRT - III conformation , which generates a partially positive charged 35 membrane interaction surface , positions short N - terminal motifs for membrane interaction and the 36 C - terminal VPS4 target sequence towards the tube interior . Inter - filament interactions are 37 electrostatic , which facilitate filament sliding upon VPS4 - mediated polymer remodeling . 38 Fluorescence microscopy as well as high speed atomic force microscopy imaging corroborate that 39 CHMP2A - CHMP3 polymers and VPS4 can constrict and cleave narrow membrane tubes , thus 40 acting as a minimal membrane fission machinery . 41 42 43 Introduction 44 The endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) machinery catalyzes 45 many divergent membrane remodeling processes including the formation of multivesicular 46 endosomes , cytokinesis , nuclear envelope reformation , membrane repair , autophagy , exosome 47 biogenesis , neuronal pruning , dendritic spine maintenance , enveloped virus budding , release of 48 peroxisomes and of recycling endosomes ( Allison et al . , 2013 ; Henne et al . , 2013 ; Loncle et al . , 49 2015 ; Mast et al . , 2018 ; Olmos and Carlton , 2016 ; Sadoul et al . , 2018 ; Scourfield and Martin - 50 Serrano , 2017 ; Votteler and Sundquist , 2013 ; Zhen et al . , 2021 ) . 51 Common to all ESCRT - catalyzed processes in eukaryotes , archaea and bacteria is the 52 recruitment of ESCRT - III proteins that polymerize to generate and / or to stabilize membranes with 53 either flat , negatively or positively curved geometries ( Bertin et al . , 2020 ; Caillat et al . , 2019 ; Gupta 54 et al . , 2021 ; Junglas et al . , 2021 ; Liu et al . , 2021 ; McCullough et al . , 2018 ; Moser von Filseck et 55 al . , 2020 ; Pfitzner et al . , 2021 ) . The principal function of the polymers is to induce membrane 56 constriction via outside - in fission of tubular structures with ESCRT - III protein coats on the outside 57 of a membrane tube or inside - out fission with ESCRT - III polymers assembled within membrane 58 neck / tube structures formed during vesicle and virus budding or at the cytokinetic midbody ( Caillat 59 et al . , 2019 ; Harker - Kirschneck et al . , 2022 ; McCullough et al . , 2018 ; Nguyen et al . , 2020 ; Pfitzner 60 et al . , 2021 ; Remec Pavlin and Hurley , 2020 ) . 61 3 Humans express eight ESCRT - III proteins that can comprise several isoforms per 62 member , corresponding to seven homologues in S . cerevisiae ( in parentheses ) named 63 CHMP1A / B ( Did2 ) , CHMP2A / B ( Vps2 ) , CHMP3 ( Vps24 ) , CHMP4A / B / C ( Snf7 ) , CHMP5 ( Vps60 ) , 64 CHMP6 ( Vps20 ) , CHMP7 and CHMP8 / IST1 ( Ist1 ) ( McCullough et al . , 2018 ) . S . cerevisiae 65 assembles two ESCRT - III subcomplexes , Vps20 / Snf7 that in turn recruits Vps24 / Vps2 ( Babst et 66 al . , 2002 ) consistent with CHMP4 recruiting CHMP3 and CHMP2A ( Morita et al . , 2011 ) . Notably , 67 Vps24 ( CHMP3 ) and Vps2 ( CHMP2 ) have been suggested to block Snf7 ( CHMP4 ) polymerization 68 and cap ESCRT - III assembly prior to recycling ( Saksena et al . , 2009 ; Teis et al . , 2008 ) . Consistent 69 with the idea of a core ESCRT - III , HIV - 1 budding can be catalyzed with a minimal set of one 70 CHMP4 and one CHMP2 isoform ( Morita et al . , 2011 ) . Although CHMP3 is not strictly required , 71 truncated versions thereof exert a potent dominant negative effect on HIV - 1 budding ( Zamborlini 72 et al . , 2006 ) and CHMP3 synergizes HIV - 1 budding efficiency with CHMP2A but not with CHMP2B 73 ( Effantin et al . , 2013 ) . Thus ESCRT - III CHMP4 , CHMP2 and CHMP3 constitute a minimal 74 machinery that together with VPS4 catalyzes membrane fission from within membrane necks as 75 suggested by in vitro reconstitution ( Schoneberg et al . , 2018 ) . 76 ESCRT - III proteins adopt a closed conformation in the cytosol ( Bajorek et al . , 2009 ; Muziol 77 et al . , 2006 ; Xiao et al . , 2009 ) . Membrane recruitment via ESCRT - I , ESCRT - II or Alix / Bro1 ( Im et 78 al . , 2009 ; McCullough et al . , 2008 ; Pineda - Molina et al . , 2006 ; Tang et al . , 2016 ) is thought to 79 induce ESCRT - III activation , which entails opening of the closed conformation ( Lata et al . , 2008a ; 80 Shim et al . , 2007 ; Zamborlini et al . , 2006 ) to an extended open polymerization - competent 81 conformation as first shown for CHMP1B ( McCullough et al . , 2015 ) . The CHMP1B polymer 82 stabilizes positively curved membranes and can co - polymerize with IST1 in the closed 83 conformation thereby forming an outer layer on top of the inner open conformation CHMP1B layer 84 ( McCullough et al . , 2015 ) , whose interplay leads to membrane tube thinning and cleavage ( Cada 85 et al . , 2022 ; Nguyen et al . , 2020 ) . 86 CHMP4 homologues , Snf7 and shrub , adopt similar open conformations within crystalline 87 polymers ( McMillan et al . , 2016 ; Tang et al . , 2015 ) . Notably in vitro CHMP4 polymers interact with 88 flat membranes , ( Chiaruttini et al . , 2015 ; Mierzwa et al . , 2017 ; Pires et al . , 2009 ) and stabilize 89 positively curved membranes in the presence of CHMP2A ( Vps2 ) and CHMP3 ( Vps24 ) ( Bertin et 90 al . , 2020 ; Moser von Filseck et al . , 2020 ) . Furthermore , CHMP4 was proposed to interact with 91 negatively curved membranes ( Lee et al . , 2015 ) and CHMP4 spirals have been imaged within 92 membrane tubes in vivo ( Cashikar et al . , 2014 ; Hanson et al . , 2008 ) leading to the model of 93 ESCRT - III spiral springs assembling on flat membranes driving membrane deformation 94 ( Chiaruttini et al . , 2015 ) . 95 4 The conservation of the structural principle of the open ESCRT - III conformation is further 96 underlined by the structures of plastid and bacterial membrane repair proteins Vipp1 and PspA , 97 which both stabilize positively curved membranes and corroborate the conservation of the 98 ESCRT - III machinery throughout all kingdoms of life ( Gupta et al . , 2021 ; Junglas et al . , 2021 ; Liu 99 et al . , 2021 ) . 100 While these structures demonstrate filament formation to stabilize positively curved 101 membranes only low resolution models of filaments stabilizing negatively curved membranes have 102 yet been imaged revealing single and multi - stranded polymers in vitro ( Bajorek et al . , 2009 ; Bertin 103 et al . , 2020 ; Chiaruttini et al . , 2015 ; Dobro et al . , 2013 ; Henne et al . , 2012 ; Lata et al . , 2008b ; 104 Mierzwa et al . , 2017 ; Moriscot et al . , 2011 ; Moser von Filseck et al . , 2020 ; Pires et al . , 2009 ) and 105 in vivo ( Bodon et al . , 2011 ; Cashikar et al . , 2014 ; Goliand et al . , 2018 ; Guizetti et al . , 2011 ; Hanson 106 et al . , 2008 ; Mierzwa et al . , 2017 ; Sherman et al . , 2016 ) . Consistent with their central role in 107 membrane fission catalyzed from within membrane necks , ESCRT - III CHMP2A and CHMP3 form 108 helical tubular structures with defined diameters in vitro , which have been suggested to stabilize 109 negative membrane curvature ( Effantin et al . , 2013 ; Lata et al . , 2008b ) . VPS4 constricts these 110 filaments producing dome - like end caps prior to complete polymer disassembly in vitro ( Maity et 111 al . , 2019 ) in agreement with permanent ESCRT - III turn - over in vivo ( Adell et al . , 2014 ; Adell et al . , 112 2017 ; Mierzwa et al . , 2017 ) . Notably , S . cerevisiae Vps2 and Vps24 form similar helical tubes that , 113 however , seem to require Snf7 for polymerization ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) . 114 Because most ESCRT - catalyzed processes act on negatively curved membranes to 115 catalyze inside - out membrane fission , we set out to determine the structural basis of ESCRT - III 116 stabilizing negatively curved membranes . We reconstituted CHMP2A - CHMP3 polymers within 117 membrane tubes , solved their structure by cryo electron microscopy and show that VPS4 can 118 indeed constrict CHMP2A - CHMP3 membrane tubes to the point of fission , corroborating that 119 CHMP2A and CHMP3 form a minimal membrane fission complex powered by VPS4 and ATP . 120 121 Results 122 Structure of the CHMP2A - CHMP3 polymer assembled within membrane tubes 123 CHMP3 full length ( residues 1 - 222 ) and C - terminally truncated CHMP2A ( residues 1 - 161 ) were 124 assembled into helical tubular structures as described ( Lata et al . , 2008b ) . After removal of the N - 125 terminal tags , the tubular structures were coated with lipid bilayer , which tightly associated with 126 the protein layer as shown by cryo electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) ( Figure S1A ) . 2D classification 127 of the manually picked tube - like structures generated a dataset composed of 5 different diameters 128 ranging from 380 Å to 490 Å , with the 410 Å ( 51 . 4 % ) and 430 Å ( 31 . 2 % ) diameters representing 129 5 the most populated classes ( Figure S1B ) . The power spectra of the segments of the class 130 averages of the two diameters ( Figures S1C and D ) were then employed to explore possible 131 helical symmetries and combined with helical real - space reconstruction ( He and Scheres , 2017 ) 132 to validate the symmetry parameters . This revealed that the 410 Å and 430 Å diameter tubes are 133 formed by elementary helices composed of respectively 6 . 3 and 6 . 6 units per turn with a small 134 pitch of 9 Å for the 410 Å diameter and 18 Å for the 430 Å diameter . The latter displays an 135 additional C2 symmetry around the helical axis , explaining the doubling of the pitch ( Figures S1C 136 and D ) . Although , the asymmetric units along the elementary helix are not biochemically 137 connected , they translate into filaments with extended interaction surfaces between subsequent 138 asymmetric units . The symmetry parameters of the filaments are relatively similar for both 139 diameters ( Rise / Twist of 8 . 227 Å / 16 . 877° and 8 . 641 Å / 17 . 701° for the 410 Å and 430 Å 140 diameters , respectively ) , and therefore likely represent the preferred polymerization mode of the 141 repeating unit , the CHMP2A - CHMP3 heterodimers ( Figures S1C and D ) . 142 Six filaments ( 2 * 3 in the case of the C2 symmetric helix ) form left - handed six - start helices 143 with helical pitches of ~ 175 Å for both diameters ( Figures 1A and B ) . The 430 Å filament is 144 composed of 21 . 33 units per turn ( Figures 1A and B ) and the 410 Å filament contains 20 . 33 units 145 per turn ( Figures 1C and D ) , indicating a helical repeat after three turns and similar inter - filament 146 interactions along the helical axis . Comparison of the 430 and 410 Å demonstrates that removal 147 of one heterodimer reduces the tube diameter by 20 Å . 148 The three - dimensional ( 3D ) helical reconstruction shows an overall resolution of 3 . 6 Å for 149 the 410 Å and 3 . 3 Å for the 430 Å diameter ( Figure 1 ; Figure S2 and Figure S3A ) with local 150 resolutions ranging from 3 . 3 Å to 4 . 6 Å for the 430 Å diameter and 3 . 6 to 5 . 2 Å for the 410 Å 151 diameter ( Figure S3B and C ) . The map of the 430 Å diameter was employed ( Figure 1E ) to build 152 the atomic model of the repeating unit of the filament , formed by the CHMP2A - CHMP3 153 heterodimer revealing both protomers in the open ESCRT - III conformation ( Figure 1F and Figure 154 S3D , Table S1 ) . 155 Comparison of the closed ( Bajorek et al . , 2009 ; Muziol et al . , 2006 ) and open CHMP3 156 conformations showed the conformational transitions upon CHMP3 activation , which involves 157 extension of the helical hairpin ( residues P12 - A101 ) that is identical in both conformations ( r . m . s . d . 158 of 1 . 082 Å ) by a linker and helix 3 ( L117 ) . The following short connection forms an elbow and 159 translates helix 4 by ~ 10 Å positioning helix 4 in a 140° angle with respect to the hairpin axis . Helix 160 4 is composed of the closed conformation helix 4 and most of the disordered linker connecting to 161 helix 5 via a 90° kink at positions M151 to D152 ( Figure 2A ) . The remaining CHMP3 residues 170 162 to 220 are flexible and disordered in the structure . Both CHMP3 and CHMP2A open conformations 163 6 are similar as superposition of their Cα atoms revealed an r . m . s . d . of 0 . 934 Å ( Figure S4A ) , 164 suggesting that CHMP2A can fold into the same closed conformation structure as CHMP3 . 165 The repeating unit of the filament is the CHMP2A - CHMP3 heterodimer formed by parallel 166 interaction of their hairpins with the CHMP2A hairpin tip shifted by six helical turns with respect to 167 CHMP3 ( Figure 2B ) . The heterodimer interaction covers 2026 Å 2 of CHMP2A and 1997 Å 2 of 168 CHMP3 surfaces involving 55 and 51 interface residues , respectively . The structure of the 169 heterodimer was further confirmed by mutagenesis . Introducing pairs of cysteine demonstrated 170 that CHMP2A _ D57C together with CHMP3 _ S75C and CHMP2A _ N18C together with 171 CHMP3 _ V110C ( Figure S5A ) assembled into disulfide - linked heterodimers upon polymerization 172 into tube - like structures as shown by SDS - PAGE analyses and negative staining EM ( Figure S5B 173 and C ) . Furthermore , mutagenesis of CHMP2A - CHMP3 interface residues ( Figure S5D ) 174 prevented polymerization as expected ( Figure S5E ) . The principle of the heterodimer hairpin 175 stacking is employed to assemble the filament , which is further stabilized by lateral interactions of 176 CHMP3i elbow helix 4 with CHMP2Ai , CHMP3i + 1 and CHMP2Ai + 1 . In addition , CHMP3i helix 5 177 interacts with the tip of the CHMP3i + 2 hairpin ( Figure 2B ) , as observed in the closed conformation 178 ( Figure 2A ) ( Bajorek et al . , 2009 ; Muziol et al . , 2006 ) . Similar to CHMP3 , CHMP2A helix 4 exerts 179 the same domain exchange interactions ( Figure 2B ) . C α superposition of the open CHMP3 180 conformation revealed the closest match with the S . cerevisiae Snf7 protomer ( Figure S4B ) and 181 considerable differences with CHMP1B , Vipp1 , PspA and Vps24 ( Gupta et al . , 2021 ; Huber et al . , 182 2020 ; Junglas et al . , 2021 ; Liu et al . , 2021 ; McCullough et al . , 2015 ) ( Figure S4C - F ) . Notably , 183 different hairpin interactions and orientations of the helical arms upon polymerization determine 184 the filament geometry that leads to positively curved membrane interaction by CHMP1B , Vipp1 185 and PspA ( Gupta et al . , 2021 ; Junglas et al . , 2021 ; Liu et al . , 2021 ; McCullough et al . , 2015 ) 186 underlining the extensive structural plasticity of ESCRT - III proteins . 187 188 CHMP2A - CHMP3 polymer interaction with membrane 189 The CHMP2A - CHMP3 polymer is tightly associated with the lipid bilayer ( Figure S1E ) and both 190 CHMP2A and CHMP3 expose the same regions to the membrane . The polymerization mode 191 positions the N - terminal regions of both CHMP2A and CHMP3 at the membrane interface . 192 Although CHMP3 residues 1 - 10 and CHMP2A residues 1 - 7 are disordered , they are both oriented 193 by conserved prolines towards the lipid bilayer ( Figure 3A ) consistent with previous suggestions 194 that short amphipathic N - terminal helices insert into the bilayer ( Bodon et al . , 2011 ; Buchkovich et 195 al . , 2013 ) . The main membrane interaction surfaces locate to the elbow formed by helices 3 and 196 4 ( residues K104 to R131 ) exposing six basic residues of CHMP2A ( K104 , K108 , R115 , K118 , 197 7 K124 , R131 ) and five basic residues of CHMP3 ( K106 , K112 , K119 , K132 , K136 ) prone to interact 198 with negative charges of the membrane ( Figure 3B ) . The electrostatic potential map shows in 199 addition to the stretch of basic surfaces some negative and non - charged regions of the outer 200 polymer surface ( Figure 3C ) . Most of the basic residues are conserved in S . cerevisiae Vps2 and 201 Vps24 ( Figure S6A ) . Notably , alanine mutagenesis of some CHMP3 basic residues within the 202 membrane interaction surface did not interfere with CHMP2A - CHMP3 polymerization in vitro 203 ( Figure S7A ) nor did they affect the dominant negative effect of C - terminally truncated CHMP3 204 on VLP release ( Figure S7B ) , indicating that membrane binding is complex and not only 205 electrostatic , consistent with plasma membrane localization of the CHMP3 mutant ( Figure S7C ) . 206 207 Inter - filament interactions 208 Conserved basic helix 1 residues of CHMP2A and CHMP3 ( Figure S6A ) are at the filament 209 interface opposed by a stretch of conserved acidic residues within helices 4 and 5 ( Figure S6A ) 210 of neighboring filaments ( Figure 3D ) , which indicate electrostatic inter - filament interactions 211 ( Figure 3C ) . Mutation of the helix 1 basic cluster within either CHMP2A or CHMP3 prevented 212 polymer formation in vitro ( Figure S7D ) , indicating that the basic charge of helix 1 is important for 213 filament polymerization , which is in line with mutagenesis of a similar cluster of basic residues 214 within helix 1 of CHMP3 abolishing its dominant negative effect on HIV - 1 budding ( Muziol et al . , 215 2006 ) . To further test the electrostatic inter - filament interactions , we exposed the helical tubular 216 CHMP2A - CHMP3 polymers to high ionic strength . This led to the partial unwinding of the filaments 217 producing single and multi - stranded filaments ( Figure S8A - E ) in agreement with the presence of 218 single and multi - start helices upon CHMP2A - CHMP3 polymerization in vitro ( Effantin et al . , 2013 ) . 219 We suggest that these electrostatic interactions between filaments enable filament sliding upon 220 VPS4 - catalyzed remodeling . The acidic cluster in helices 4 and 5 is conserved in CHMP4A , B , C , 221 CHMP5 and CHMP6 ( Figure S6B ) indicating potential similar involvement in inter - filament 222 interaction for the formation of mixed filaments . Notably , the acidic cluster is not conserved in 223 CHMP1A and B , which stabilizes positively curved membranes via basic charges present on the 224 inside of the protein tube - like polymer ( McCullough et al . , 2015 ) . We therefore suggest that the 225 acidic cluster is a hallmark of ESCRT - III stabilizing negatively curved membrane structures . 226 227 VPS4 remodels and cleaves CHMP2A - CHMP3 membrane tubes 228 We next tested whether VPS4B can remodel the CHMP2A - CHMP3 membrane coated tubes as 229 we have shown before for CHMP2A - CHMP3 tubes without membrane ( Maity et al . , 2019 ) . When 230 we incubated CHMP2A - CHMP3 and VPS4B containing membrane tubes ( Figure S9A ) with ATP 231 8 and Mg 2 + , complete disassembly of the tubes was observed ( Figure S9B and C ) . In order to image 232 tube remodeling by fluorescence microscopy , VPS4B and caged ATP were incorporated into the 233 tubes wrapped with fluorescently labelled membrane . Imaging of tubes containing either only 234 caged ATP ( Figures 4A and B ; movie 1 ; Figures S10A and B ; movie 2 ) or only VPS4B ( Figures 235 4C and D ; movie 3 ) demonstrated that photolysis used to uncage ATP did not affect the tube 236 structure . However , tubes containing both caged ATP and VPS4B revealed constriction and tube 237 cleavage upon ATP activation at different sites starting at 30s leading to complete disassembly 238 within 270s ( Figures 4E and F ; movie 4 ) or starting at 69s ( Figures S10C and D ; movie 5 ) or 239 50 s ( movie 6 ) . 240 Tube cleavage was further confirmed by high - speed AFM ( HS - AFM ) imaging . First , 241 CHMP2A - CHMP3 tubes with and without membrane were imaged ( Figures S11A - C ) . A 242 comparative height histogram showed an increase in tube height of ~ 8 nm for the membrane 243 coated tubes ( Figure S11D ) , as expected for an unilamellar membrane coating . Next , membrane - 244 coated tubes loaded with 10 µM caged ATP with and without UV exposure ( Figure S11E ; movie 245 7 ) were recorded by HS - AFM . In the absence of VPS4B , photolysis of the caged ATP did not 246 induce changes in tube morphology , consistent with the observations using fluorescence 247 microscopy . Further , no changes in tube morphology were observed without UV exposure for an 248 extended period of time of CHMP2A - CHMP3 tubes coated with membrane and loaded with 249 VPS4B and caged ATP ( Figure 5A , movie 8 ) . However , upon UV exposure , constriction and 250 cleavage of the membrane coated tubes was observed ( Figure 5B ; movie 9 ) . Kymographs along 251 the tube cross section ( Figure 5C ) and the evolution of the height at the constriction sites over 252 time ( Figure 5D ) reveal that complete cleavage of the membrane tube occurs within a time period 253 of ~ 200 s of UV exposure . We conclude that VPS4B can constrict the CHMP2A - CHMP3 filaments 254 bound to membranes that leads to membrane cleavage , reminiscent of membrane fission . 255 256 Discussion 257 The structure of the CHMP2A - CHMP3 heteropolymer demonstrates how ESCRT - III 258 filaments polymerize into rigid structures that can stabilize and / or shape negatively curved 259 membrane necks with diameters of approximately 50 nm . Such membrane structures are present 260 at many ESCRT - catalyzed processes including vesicle and virus budding or at later stages during 261 cytokinetic midbody constriction ( McCullough et al . , 2018 ; Vietri et al . , 2020 ) . Although the 262 structural principles of the open ESCRT - III conformation are highly conserved between 263 CHMP2A / CHMP3 and CHMP1B ( McCullough et al . , 2015 ) , Snf7 / Shrub ( CHMP4 ) ( McMillan et al . , 264 2016 ; Tang et al . , 2015 ) and bacterial PspA and Vipp1 ( Gupta et al . , 2021 ; Junglas et al . , 2021 ; 265 9 Liu et al . , 2021 ) , differences in helical hairpin stacking and orientations of the helical arms dictates 266 the geometry of the filaments that stabilize positively curved membrane or negatively curved 267 membrane as in case of CHMP2A - CHMP3 polymerization . Furthermore , assembly modes of 268 ESCRT - III monomers can vary as shown for CHMP2A , CHMP3 and CHMP4B , which can yet 269 adapt another filament geometry that stabilizes positively curved membranes ( Bertin et al . , 2020 ; 270 Moser von Filseck et al . , 2020 ) . Thus the plastic nature of ESCRT - III protein conformations can 271 lead to variable ESCRT - III filament geometries that can adapt a wide range of curvatures to 272 accommodate ESCRT function in different membrane remodeling processes ( Pfitzner et al . , 273 2021 ) . 274 A striking feature of the CHMP2A - CHMP3 polymer is the narrow range of tube diameters , 275 indicative of a late recruitment during the constriction process . During yeast MVB biogenesis , 276 Vps24 / Vps2 ( CHMP3 / CHMP2 ) is indeed recruited last prior to complete ESCRT - III disassembly 277 and probably completion of fission ( Babst et al . , 2002 ; Saksena et al . , 2009 ; Teis et al . , 2008 ) . 278 Likewise , CHMP4 isoforms recruit CHMP3 and CHMP2A to HIV - 1 budding sites ( Johnson et al . , 279 2018 ; Morita et al . , 2011 ; Prescher et al . , 2015 ) . The narrow range of diameters of the CHMP2A - 280 CHMP3 polymer structure suggests that recruitment of CHMP3 and CHMP2A molds membrane 281 necks into approximately 40 to 50 nm diameters , which sets the stage for further constriction . 282 Comparison of the 410 and 430 Å wide structures shows that removal of only one CHMP2A - 283 CHMP3 heterodimer per filament turn reduces the tube diameter by 20 Å , indicating how a 284 stepwise removal of heterodimers can successively induce membrane constriction . 285 Another feature of the tubular polymer is that it can assemble from single or multi - stranded 286 filaments ( Effantin et al . , 2013 ) the latter being the preferred assembly in vitro . Interaction between 287 filaments is driven by complementary positive and negative charges . However , surprisingly , high 288 ionic strength did not disassemble the tube consistently into individual filaments but partially 289 preserved the multi - strand architecture in vitro . The 17 . 5 nm width of the six - stranded helix present 290 in the structure fits the 17 nm wide helices imaged at the midbody ( Guizetti et al . , 2011 ) , 291 suggesting that such spirals contain six ESCRT - III filaments . Since inter - filament interactions are 292 electrostatic , different ESCRT - III filaments may contribute to the formation of mixed multi - stranded 293 filaments ( Mierzwa et al . , 2017 ; Pfitzner et al . , 2020 ) . In line , acidic residues within helix 4 and 294 basic residues within helix 1 have been implicated in S . cerevisiae Snf7 - Vps24 interaction 295 ( Banjade et al . , 2019 ) . Because basic and acidic charges within these regions are conserved in 296 CHMP6 , CHMP4A , B , C , CHMP2B and CHMP5 , filaments thereof may also form side by side via 297 homo - or hetero - filament assembly . The loose electrostatic inter - filament interactions likely 298 facilitate sliding of filaments upon ESCRT - III filament remodeling by VPS4 , which catalyzes 299 10 filament constriction prior to complete disassembly ( Maity et al . , 2019 ) . Notably , dynamic VPS4 - 300 mediated turnover of ESCRT - III has been proposed in different membrane remodeling processes 301 ( Adell et al . , 2014 ; Adell et al . , 2017 ; Mierzwa et al . , 2017 ) . 302 CHMP2A - CHMP3 polymers have been suggested to interact with negatively charged 303 membranes ( De Franceschi et al . , 2018 ; Lin et al . , 2005 ; Whitley et al . , 2003 ) , which is confirmed 304 by the cluster of basic residues within the membrane interaction surface . Furthermore , the 305 structure indicates that short N - terminal hydrophobic motifs , implicated in ESCRT - III function 306 ( Bodon et al . , 2011 ) ( Buchkovich et al . , 2013 ) are positioned to insert into the membrane . Although 307 this N - terminal motif is helical in a filament structure assembled by an intermediate Vps24 308 ( CHMP3 ) conformation ( Huber et al . , 2020 ) , the corresponding helices of CHMP2A and CHMP3 309 are not visible in the membrane - bound structure suggesting that the putative amphipathic helices 310 can adopt different membrane insertion angles . Polymer interaction with membrane is tight , which 311 excludes other membrane proteins thereby serving as a diffusion barrier ( De Franceschi et al . , 312 2018 ) . 313 CHMP3 is dispensable for HIV - 1 budding ( Morita et al . , 2011 ) and S . cerevisiae Vps24 can 314 be substituted by Vps2 overexpression restoring partial endosomal cargo sorting ( Banjade et al . , 315 2021 ) . Both processes depend on CHMP2A and Vps2 interaction with CHMP4 or Snf7 ( Teis et 316 al . , 2008 ) , ( Morita et al . , 2011 ) . The structure suggests that CHMP3 can be structurally replaced 317 by CHMP2A in the polymer , indicating that CHMP2A filaments on their own may form similar 318 helices . Although CHMP2A can polymerize into circular filaments with approximate diameters of 319 40 nm that often coil up , no regular CHMP2A tube - like structures have been yet imaged in vitro 320 ( Effantin et al . , 2013 ) . 321 VPS4B remodels CHMP2A - CHMP3 helical tubular structures in vitro ( Caillat et al . , 2015 ; 322 Lata et al . , 2008b ) inducing filament constriction and cleavage that generates dome - like end caps 323 prior to complete disassembly , which was proposed to drive membrane fission ( Fabrikant et al . , 324 2009 ; Maity et al . , 2019 ) . Here , we show that VPS4B constricts and cleaves CHMP2A - CHMP3 325 membrane - coated tubes via membrane fission likely via the formation of dome - like end - caps 326 ( Maity et al . , 2019 ) . Cleavage of membrane tubes pulled from GUVs has been reported previously 327 by employing a minimal system composed of S . cerevisiae Snf7 , Vps24 , Vps2 and Vps4 328 ( Schoneberg et al . , 2018 ) , while another model proposed sequential recruitment of S . cerevisiae 329 Snf7 , followed by Vps2 - Vps24 , Vps2 - Did2 and Did2 - Ist1 for final constriction ( Pfitzner et al . , 2020 ) . 330 Our data suggest that CHMP2A - CHMP3 filaments constitute together with VPS4 a minimal 331 ESCRT - III membrane fission machinery that can constrict membrane necks with 40 to 50 nm large 332 diameters to the point of fission . It is yet unclear how many helical turns are required for 333 11 constriction in vivo , although more than one , as estimated from imaging ( Adell et al . , 2017 ) , would 334 allow filament sliding powered by ATP - driven forces that can drive filament - induced membrane 335 constriction and cleavage . Finally , catalyzing membrane fission with a minimal machinery is well 336 in line with ancestral ESCRT - III function ( Caspi and Dekker , 2018 ; Ithurbide et al . , 2022 ) . 337 338 Methods 339 340 Expression and purification 341 CHMP2A∆C containing residues 1 to 161 was subcloned in a pMAL - c5X vector with an additional 342 TEV site at the amino terminal end and expressed as a MBP fusion protein in the C41 ( DE3 ) E . 343 coli bacterial strain ( Lucigen ) . Expression was induced for 1h at 37°C . Bacteria were lysed by 344 sonication in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 5 mM EDTA 345 and protease inhibitors . Cleared lysate was applied onto an amylose resin ( New England Biolabs ) , 346 washed with buffer A ( 25mM HEPES 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1mM DTT ) , then with Buffer B ( 25 mM 347 HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 1 M NaCl , 1 M KCl , 1mM DTT ) followed by a last wash with Buffer A . Finally , 348 protein was eluted with buffer C ( 25 mM HEPES 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM maltose ) . The most 349 concentrated fraction was directly applied to size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) Superdex 200 350 column ( GE Healthcare ) in buffer D ( 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl ) . 351 Full - length CHMP3 was subcloned in a pProEX - HTb vector ( Life Technologies , Thermo Fisher ) 352 and expressed in BL21Gold ( DE3 ) E . coli bacterial strain ( Agilent ) . Expression was induced for 3h 353 at 37°C and purified as described ( Lata et al . , 2008b ) with minor modifications . Bacteria were 354 lysed by sonication in buffer E ( 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 10mM imidazole ) containing 355 protease inhibitors and the cleared lysate was applied onto a Ni 2 + - chelating sepharose ( Cytivia ) , 356 washed extensively with lysis buffer E , and subsequently with buffer F ( 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 357 300 mM NaCl , 300 mM KCl , 20 mM imidazole ) and buffer G ( 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM 358 NaCl , 300 mM KCl , 50 mM imidazole ) . Finally , CHMP3 was eluted with buffer H ( 25 mM HEPES 359 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 350 mM imidazole ) and cleaved overnight at 4°C with Tobacco Etch Virus 360 ( TEV ) protease at 1 : 100 ( w / w ) ratio in the presence of 10 mM β - mercaptoethanol . Cleaved protein 361 was then applied on a second Ni 2 + - chelating sepharose in order to remove TEV , the His - tag and 362 uncleaved protein . The final step included size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) on a Superdex 363 75 column ( GE Healthcare ) in buffer D . CHMP3 concentrated at 300 µM was frozen for further 364 use . 365 CHMP2A∆C - mutants containing residues 9 to 161 and CHMP3 - mutants containing residues 9 to 366 183 were synthesized ( ThermoFisher ) , subcloned in a pETM40 vector ( PEPcore facility - EMBL 367 12 Heidelberg ) and the pProEX - HTb ( ThermoFisher ) vector , respectively . Mutants were expressed 368 and purified as described above for wild type sequences . 369 370 CHMP2A - CHMP3 membrane tube generation 371 For helical tube formation as described previously ( Lata et al . , 2008b ) , 10 µM CHMP2A∆C was 372 mixed with 20 µM full - length CHMP3 and incubated for 48 - 72h at 4°C . After incubation , tubes 373 were harvested by centrifugation at 20 , 000g for 30min and the pellet containing CHMP2A∆C - 374 CHMP3 tubes was resuspended in buffer D . In order to wrap the CHMP2A∆C - CHMP3 tubes with 375 a lipid bilayer , the following lipid film was produced containing 70 % Egg phosphatidyl choline ( Egg 376 PC ) , 10 % dioleoyl glycero phosphoserine ( DOPS ) , 10 % dioleoyl glycerol phosphoethanolamine 377 ( DOPE ) , 10 % brain phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) and 2µL of dioleoyl - sn - 378 glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl ) ( LISS - Rhodamin PE ) ( all 379 Avanti Polar lipids ) . The lipid film was resuspended in water at a final concentration of 5 mg / mL . 380 The CHMP2A∆C - CHMP3 tubes ( 25 µL ) were mixed with 25 µL of 2 % CHAPS , 25 µL of lipids and 381 0 . 1 mg / mL of TEV protease ( to remove the MBP from CHMP2A∆C ) and incubated at room 382 temperature for 2h . To remove free lipids / micelles and CHAPS , the tubes were dialyzed twice for 383 48 - 72h against buffer I ( 25mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 25 mM NaCl , 1 mM β - mercaptoethanol and 0 . 5 g of 384 Bio - Beads ( Biorad ) . After dialysis , CHMP2A∆C - CHMP3 tubes wrapped with bilayer were 385 incubated with Bio - Beads overnight at 4°C and removed by centrifugation . The quality of the 386 bilayer wrapped CHMP2A∆C - CHMP3 tubes was assessed by negative staining EM prior to cryo - 387 EM data collection , fluorescence microscopy imaging and HS - AFM analysis . 388 To test remodeling by VPS4 , CHMP2A - CHMP3 tubes were incubated with 10 to 20 µM VPS4B , 5 389 mM MgCl 2 and 5 or 10 mM caged ATP ( # A1048 Invitrogen ) prior to membrane wrapping , following 390 the protocol described above . Because deposition of the membrane onto the CHMP2A - CHMP3 391 protein coat requires extensive dialysis , the final VPS4 concentration present within the tubes can 392 be only estimated from SDS - PAGE ; however , the final concentration of caged ATP inserted into 393 the tubes cannot be determined . 394 395 CHMP2A - CHMP3 - VPS4 membrane tube imaging 396 Epifluorescence video microscopy of CHMP2A - CHMP3 membrane tubes containing VPS4B and 397 caged ATP was performed using an Olympus IX83 optical microscope equipped with a UPFLN 398 100X O - 2PH / 1 . 3 objective and an ORCA - Flash4 . 0 Digital sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu ) . A 5 μL 399 aliquot of ESCRT - III tube suspension was spread on a slide , covered with a glass coverslip ( # 1 ) 400 and sealed with twinsil speed 22 ( Picodent , ref 13001002 ) for imaging . Caged - ATP was uncaged 401 13 using a 10s 10 % 365 - nm LED illumination ( Figures 4A - F and movies S1 - 4 ) or using at each time 402 point a 100ms 30 % 365 - nm LED illumination ( Figure S10 and movies S5 and S6 ) . ESCRT tubes 403 were fluorescently imaged using a 550nm LED ( 10 % with an exposure time of 100ms ) at 1 frame / s . 404 Images were acquired using the Volocity software package . Images were analyzed , adjusted , and 405 cropped using ImageJ software . 406 407 HS - AFM analysis 408 The AFM images were acquired in amplitude modulation tapping mode in liquid , using high - speed 409 atomic force microscopes ( RIBM , Japan ) ( Maity et al . , 2019 ; Maity et al . , 2020 ) . The HS - AFM 410 imaging was performed using USC - F1 . 2 - k0 . 15 cantilevers ( NanoWorld , Switzerland ) , an 411 ultrashort cantilever with a nominal spring constant of 0 . 15 N / m and a resonance frequency ≈ 0 . 5 412 MHz . All HS - AFM recordings were done at room temperature and in buffer D . Uncaging of the 413 caged ATP was performed by directly irradiating 365 nm UV light at the AFM sample stage using 414 an optical fiber . The membrane coated tubes were immobilized at the surface using streptavidin 415 on top of a lipid bilayer ( DOPC ) on mica containing 0 . 01 % biotinylated lipid ( Keya et al . , 2017 ) . 416 HS - AFM images were analyzed using Igor Pro , and ImageJ with additional home written plugins 417 ( Maity et al . , 2022 ) . Height measurements were performed on raw images after tilt correction . 418 419 Dominant negative effect of CHMP3 ( 1 - 150 ) wild type and mutants 420 CHMP3 residues 1 - 150 wt or mutants were synthesized ( ThermoFisher ) and cloned into the 421 pEGFP - N1 vector using restriction sites Xho 1 - Hind III . To determine the effect of GFP - CHMP3 ( 1 - 422 150 ) on virus like particle ( VLP ) production upon HIV - 1 Gag expression , 293T cells were seeded 423 into 10mm dishes and transfected 24 hr later using a Jetprime ( Polyplus ) technique . The cultures 424 were co - transfected wit h 0 . 5 μg of Rev - independent HIV - 1 Gag construct and with 2 μg of either 425 pcDNA or wild type and mutant versions of GFP - CHMP3 ( 1 - 150 ) . Twenty - four hours post 426 transfection , VLPs released into the culture medium were pelleted through sucrose . HIV - 1 Gag 427 proteins in VLPs and cell lysates were detected by Western blotting with a mouse anti - p24 428 antibody ( 183 - H12 - 5C ) . For life cell imaging cells were seeded in glass bottomed μ - dishes and 429 co - transfected with 0 . 8 μg of Rev - independent HIV - 1 Gag construct , 0 . 2 μg of Gag - mCherry 430 ( Jouvenet et al . , 2008 ) and with 1 μg of either wild type or mutant GFP - CHMP3 ( 1 - 150 ) . ESCRT - 431 III and Gag protein localization was analyzed by spinning disc confocal microscopy 24 hr post 432 transfection in HeLA cells . 433 434 14 Cryo - EM sample preparation and data collection 435 Cryo - electron microscopy . 3 . 5 µL of sample were applied to glow discharged ( 45s 30 mA ) 1 . 2 / 1 . 3 436 Ultrafoil holey grids ( Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH , Germany ) and they were plunged frozen in 437 liquid ethane with a Vitrobot Mark IV ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) ( 100 % humidity , temperature 20°C , 438 6 s blot time , blot force 0 ) . The grids were pre - screened on the 200kV Glacios electron microscope 439 ( Thermo Fischer Scientific ) at the IBS ( Grenoble ) and data were collected at the beamline CM01 440 of the ESRF ( Grenoble , France ) ( Kandiah et al . , 2019 ) on a Titan Krios G3 ( Thermo Fischer 441 Scientific ) at 300 kV equipped with an energy filter ( Bioquantum LS / 967 , Gatan Inc , USA ) ( slit 442 width of 20 eV ) . 5028 movies were recorded automatically on a K2 summit direct detector ( Gatan 443 Inc . , USA ) with EPU ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for a total exposure time of 5 s and 200 ms per 444 frame resulting in 25 frame movies with a total dose of ~ 24 e − / Å 2 . The magnification was 130 , 000x 445 ( 1 . 052 Å / pixel at the camera level ) . The defocus of the images was adjusted between −0 . 5 and 446 −1 . 5 μm in 0 . 2 μm steps . For the high ionic strength unwinding of the CHMP2A - CHMPA filament 447 the same grid and freezing conditions have been used as described above and images have been 448 recorded on the Glacios electron microscope using a K2 direct electron detector . 449 450 EM image analysis and 3D reconstructions 451 The workflow of the image analysis is shown in Figure S2 . Electron beam - induced sample motion 452 on the recorded movie frames was corrected using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al . , 2017 ) and the 453 contrast transfer function ( CTF ) was estimated with CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff , 2015 ) . 454 9 , 207 filaments were manually picked from 5 , 027 micrographs using the EMAN2 program 455 e2helixboxer . py ( Tang et al . , 2007 ) . All subsequent data processing steps were carried out in 456 RELION3 ( Scheres , 2012 ; Zivanov et al . , 2018 ) unless mentioned otherwise . Initially , 89 , 122 457 overlapping segments were extracted with ~ 90 % overlap between boxes of 768 x 768 pixels and 458 down sampled to a pixel size of 2 . 104 for initial classification steps . Several rounds of 2D 459 classification resulted in class averages that could be classified into 5 main different groups based 460 on the filament diameter , without membrane ( 380 Å diameter ( 7 . 4 % ) , 410 Å diameter ( 51 . 4 % ) , 461 430 Å diameter ( 31 . 2 % ) , 470 Å diameter ( 1 . 9 % ) and 490 Å diameter ( 0 . 3 % ) ) . In order to 462 compensate for potential mis - assignment of diameters to the segments due to inaccuracies in 2D 463 classification , we assigned to each entire tube a diameter based on the class assignment of the 464 corresponding segments . If more than 80 % of segments of a particular tube were belonging to 465 classes assigned to a particular diameter , this entire tube would be assigned this diameter for the 466 subsequent steps . After re - extraction of segments with ~ 95 % overlap , another round of 2D 467 classification was performed for each diameter group . Most populated 2D classes with filament 468 15 diameter of 430 Å and 410 Å were chosen for further processing and analysis . For determination 469 of helical symmetry , the sum of power spectra from a smaller subset ( 1 , 904 and 3 , 993 segments 470 from one 2D class each for 430 Å and 410 Å respectively ) was calculated for both filament groups . 471 The resulting average power spectrum ( Figures S1C and D ) was analyzed for estimation of 472 helical symmetry parameters using the web tool helixplorer ( http : / / rico . ibs . fr / helixplorer / ) . Based 473 on a prior visual inspection of the PS , we made following hypotheses : the layer line with a 474 maximum seemingly on the meridian could be the helical rise or the pitch ( given the large diameter 475 of the tube and possibilities that selected 2D class averages contained a number of slightly out - 476 of - plane tilted segments ) . Given those two hypotheses , and allowing any cyclic symmetries , we 477 explored possible helical symmetries matching the experimental PS , giving a list of 20 and 15 478 symmetries to test for the 430 Å and 410 Å diameter classes , respectively . Those symmetries 479 were applied on the real - space 2D class - averages using SPRING program 480 segclassreconstruct . py ( Desfosses et al . , 2014 ) in order to generate initial models and narrowing 481 down possible symmetry solutions to 14 and 10 , by discarding those giving aberrant density 482 distribution . Using those initial models , each of the remaining symmetry solutions was tested for 483 3D refinement in RELION3 , and the resulting maps inspected for high - resolution features such as 484 clear secondary structures , allowing to determine the helical parameters to be 18 Å pitch , 2 . 72 Å 485 rise , 54 . 39° twist , 6 . 6 units / turn and C2 point symmetry for 430 Å , and 9 Å pitch , 1 . 43 Å rise , 57° 486 twist , 6 . 3 units / turn and C1 point symmetry for 410 Å diameter filaments . 487 In order to select a more homogeneous subset of segments , we applied 3D classification and the 488 classes ( containing 25 , 353 and 11 , 396 segments for diameters 430 and 410 Å ) were chosen for 489 a final round of 3D auto - refine reconstruction that converged to a 2 . 74 Å rise and 54 . 37° twist for 490 430 Å , and 1 . 44 Å rise and 57 . 04° twist for 410 Å diameter filaments . Using soft protein - only 491 masks , the final resolutions were estimated at 3 . 3 Å and 3 . 6 Å for the 430 Å and 410 Å diameter 492 filaments , at the FSC ( Fourier shell correlation ) 0 . 143 cutoff criterion ( Rosenthal and Henderson , 493 2003 ) . The maps were sharpened with bfactors of - 96 . 57 Å 2 ( 430 Å ) and - 101 . 52 Å 2 ( 410 Å ) . Local 494 resolution was estimated in RELION3 ( Scheres , 2012 ) and the density maps were rendered in 495 UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . The statistics of the EM map are summarized in Table 496 S1 . 497 498 Atomic modelling and validation 499 The SWISS - MODEL ( Waterhouse et al . , 2018 ) server was used to create homology models of 500 human CHMP3 and CHMP2A , using the open conformation of CHMP1B ( PDB ID 6TZ4 ) as a 501 reference model . Helices with residues 15 - 52 , 57 - 117 and 120 - 151 for CHMP3 and 14 - 51 , 56 - 116 502 16 and 119 - 150 for CHMP2A were initially fit into the EM density as separate rigid bodies using 503 Chimera and then adjusted in Coot ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) . Further , the rest of the N - terminal and 504 C - terminal residues , as well as the connecting loops were manually built and adjusted in Coot . 505 The CHMP2A - CHMP3 heterodimer model was then expanded by helical symmetry in each 506 direction in order to get 10 such dimers surrounding the central dimer . Thus , a total of 11 helical 507 symmetry - related dimers were again checked in Coot , before applying the first round of real - space 508 refinement in PHENIX ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) with non - crystallographic symmetry ( NCS ) restraints . 509 NCS , along with SS ( secondary structure ) restraints were then used for a second round of real - 510 space refinement . At last , the symmetry - related dimers were removed and the central CHMP2A - 511 CHMP3 dimer was saved as the final model . The statistics of the final models were tabulated 512 using MolProbity ( Williams et al . , 2018 ) and are summarized in Table S1 and map versus atomic 513 model FSC plots were computed in PHENIX ( Afonine et al . , 2018 ) . All structure figures were 514 generated with UCSF Chimera , ChimeraX ( Goddard et al . , 2018 ) and PyMOL ( W . Delano ; The 515 PyMOL Molecular Graphics System , Version 1 . 8 Schrödinger , LLC , http : / / www . pymol . org ) . 516 Sequence alignments were performed with Clustal Omega ( Goujon et al . , 2010 ) and ESPript 517 ( Robert and Gouet , 2014 ) . 518 519 Data Availability 520 Cryo - EM maps and models were deposited to the PDB and EMDB with the following codes : 521 membrane - bound CHMP2A - CHMP3 , 430 Å diameter ( PDB ID 7ZCG , EMD - 14630 ) and 522 membrane - bound CHMP2A - CHMP3 , 410 Å diameter ( PDB ID 7ZCH , EMD - 14631 ) . 523 524 Acknowledgement 525 This research was funded by the ANR ( ANR - 14 - CE09 - 0003 - 01 ; ANR - 19 - CE11 - 0002 - 02 ) ( W .
