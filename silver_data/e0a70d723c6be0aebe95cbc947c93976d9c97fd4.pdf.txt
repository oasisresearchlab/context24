Med . 2017 Vol . 214 No . 1 59 – 71 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1084 / jem . 20161228 59 IntroductIon The actin cytoskeleton is crucial for normal immune func - tion , and a growing number of primary immunodeficiencies are caused by mutations in actin - regulating genes ( Moulding et al . , 2013 ) . Autoinflammatory diseases ( AIDs ) are defined as diseases predominantly of the innate immune system resulting in abnormally increased inflammation ( Standing et al . , 2013 ) , and it is recognized that autoinflammation and immunodefi - ciency may coexist ( Frenkel , 2014 ) . Recently , a new AID has been described in mice ( WDR1 rd / rd mouse ) , caused by reces - sive mutation in WDR1 ( Kile et al . , 2007 ; Kim et al . , 2015 ) , a WD40 repeat protein that interacts with cofilin to promote F - actin severing and depolymerization ( Okada et al . , 1999 , 2002 ; Rodal et al . , 1999 ; Ono et al . , 2004 ) . Autoinflammation in the WDR1 rd / rd mouse is caused by excessive IL - 18 pro - duction by monocytes , and not by IL - 1 β . This dysregulated monocytic IL - 18 secretion requires caspase - 1 , apoptosis - as - sociated speck - like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain ( ASC ) , and pyrin ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) . In this study , we have identified a family with severe autoinflammatory disease with many features in common with the murine disease , and harboring a variant in WDR1 . results and dIscussIon Two Pakistani girls ( patients IV - 2 and IV - 4 ; Fig . 1 A ) born of consanguineous parents suffered from a severe AID begin - ning in the first weeks of life . Both had periodic fevers lasting 3 – 7 d , every 6 – 12 wk , with severe acute phase responses : C - reactive protein , > 270 mg / liter ( reference range [ RR ] < 20 ) ; serum Amyloid A , > 200 mg / liter ( RR < 10 ) ; leukocytosis , 32 × 10 9 / liter ( predominantly neutrophils ) ; hyperferritinaemia , 82 – 2 , 679 µg / ml ( RR 11 – 76 ) ; and thrombocytopenia , 24 – 90 × 10 9 / liter ; as well as normalization of these parameters in t he importance of actin dynamics in the activation of the inflammasome is becoming increasingly apparent . Il - 1 β , which is activated by the inflammasome , is known to be central to the pathogenesis of many monogenic autoinflammatory diseases . However , evidence from an autoinflammatory murine model indicates that Il - 18 , the other cytokine triggered by inflam - masome activity , is important in its own right . In this model , autoinflammation was caused by mutation in the actin regulatory gene Wdr1 . We report a homozygous missense mutation in Wdr1 in two siblings causing periodic fevers with immunodefi - ciency and thrombocytopenia . We found impaired actin dynamics in patient immune cells . Patients had high serum levels of Il - 18 , without a corresponding increase in Il - 18 – binding protein or Il - 1 β , and their cells also secreted more Il - 18 but not Il - 1 β in culture . We found increased caspase - 1 cleavage within patient monocytes indicative of increased inflammasome activity . We transfected HeK293t cells with pyrin and wild - type and mutated Wdr1 . Mutant protein formed aggregates that appeared to accumulate pyrin ; this could potentially precipitate inflammasome assembly . We have extended the findings from the mouse model to highlight the importance of Wdr1 and actin regulation in the activation of the inflammasome , and in human autoinflammation .

Both had severe recurrent oral inflam - mation , which caused scarring and acquired microstomia in patient IV - 2 ( Fig . 1 B ) , and recurrent perianal ulceration . Genetic screening for common AIDs ( TNF RSF1A , MVK , NLRP3 , and MEFV ) was negative . Frequent infections were also observed even before immunosuppression . Patient IV - 4 developed Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia at 5 mo of age ; and Staphylococcus aureus septic arthritis of the knee at 2 yr of age . Patient IV - 2 developed Streptococcus pneumonia nec - rotizing cellulitis 13 yr of age ( Fig . 1 C ) . Both developed severe inflammatory responses to ( presumed ) viral infec - tions , with moderate thrombocytopenia . Mean platelet vol - ume ( MPV ) was elevated in patient IV - 2 , but within normal range for IV - 4 ( Fig . 1 D ) . Bone marrow aspirate in patient IV - 4 revealed ultrastructural abnormalities of megakaryocytes by electron microscopy ( Fig . 1 E ) . Detailed immunological work - up of both children excluded autoimmunity , com - mon primary immunodeficiency syndromes , and primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( Table S1 ) . In patient IV - 4 , phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) stimulation of T cells was normal , but T cell activation in response to stimulation with anti - CD3 was diminished , implicating a defect in adaptive immunity . Patient IV - 2 had normal T cell activation to PHA , but T cell activation in response to anti - CD3 was not doc - umented . Neutrophil respiratory burst and phagocytosis of opsonized Escherichia coli ( in IV - 4 ) were normal . Figure 1 . clinical features and results of genetic analyses in the family . The family pedigree ( A ) shows the two affected female siblings , and their two unaffected siblings from consanguineous marriage of double first cousins ; segregation of the c . 877C > T WDR1 variant is also shown . Acquired microstomia ( B ) in patient IV - 2 aged 12 yr and 10 mo , the consequence of recurrent sterile oral inflammatory episodes . At 13 yr of age , patient IV - 2 developed a severe necrotizing cellulitis of the neck caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae ( C ) . ( D ) Mean platelet volume ( fl ) derived from a standard complete blood count using a Beckman Coulter counter . Normal reference range ( 7 . 8 – 11 fl ) is denoted by the gray shaded area . Data are 20 random measurements taken as routine clinical care ; horizontal lines denote mean and SEM . Patient IV - 2 had mean MPV consistently greater than the reference range ( with the exception of two measurements : mean MPV , 11 . 77 fl ; range , 10 . 6 – 13 . 10 ) , and significantly higher than her sibling both before and after HSCT ( P < 0 . 0001 , ANO VA ) . Patient IV - 4 had MPV consistently within normal range ( mean , 9 . 58 fl ; range , 8 . 50 – 11 . 00 ) . However , MPV was significantly lower after HSCT ( P = 0 . 0091 , nonpaired Student’s t test ) . Transmission electron microscopy of megakaryocytes in a bone marrow aspirate before allogeneic HSCT in patient IV - 4 ( E ) revealed oc - casional small , atypical megakaryocytes with no nucleus and failure of the demarcating membrane system to develop resulting in a large peripheral zone ( arrows ) devoid of organelles and granules . Developing platelets were located in the central area of the cell . 61 JEM Vol . 214 , No . 1 Both children partially responded to corticosteroids , and to colchicine , but poor growth and inflammatory attacks per - sisted . Patient IV - 2 failed several antiinflammatory and im - munosuppressive agents ( Table S1 ) . There was , however , some transient steroid sparing effect in response to anakinra ( 2 – 4 mg / kg s . c . daily ) . Ultimately , however , this did not control the episodes of autoinflammation , and this patient died at 14 yr of age from sterile systemic inflammation and multiorgan failure . Patient IV - 4 successfully underwent allogeneic hema - topoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) at age 8 , and re - mains well , off all medication , 3 yr later . We used exome sequencing combined with homo - zygosity mapping to investigate the genetic cause . Regions of homozygosity are provided in Table S2 . We confirmed that there were no further variants of interest in any known autoinflammatory genes in the INF EVE RS database ( Sar - rauste de Menthière et al . , 2003 ) or HLH genes ( Bode et al . , 2012 ) , including NLRC4 ( Canna et al . , 2014 ) , nor in genes that could generate increased IgA levels , such as CD40L or NEMO ( Allen et al . , 1993 ; Orange et al . , 2004 ) . On chromo - some 4 , a homozygous mutation was identified in WDR1 through exome sequencing , which has not been reported in dbSNP or the exome sequencing project databases . This mis - sense mutation affects both transcripts of the gene : transcript 1 exon 8 c . 877C > T , amino acid change L293F and transcript 2 exon 5 c . 457C > T , amino acid change L153F are predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen2 ( Adzhubei et al . , 2010 ) and MutationTaster ( Schwarz et al . , 2010 ) and segregated with disease ( Fig . 1 A ) . The protein comprises 14 WD40 repeats , which are organized into two propellers with seven blades each ( Fig . 2 A ; Mohri et al . , 2004 ) . The mutation is predicted to disrupt intramolecular hydrophobic interactions , which are important for maintaining protein structure ( Fig . 2 , B – E ) . The cofilin – WDR1 complex facilitates breakdown of existing filaments while promoting increased F - actin po - lymerization from newly created barbed ends , and is thus pivotal in the maintenance of cytoskeletal integrity and function ( Rodal et al . , 1999 ) . In the WDR1 rd / rd mouse , neu - trophils and macrophages showed increased levels of polym - erized actin compared with wild - type . Phalloidin staining and flow cytometry of monocyte - derived DCs ( moDCs ) , CD14 − lymphocytes , and Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) – trans - formed lymphoblasts from IV - 4 demonstrated increased levels of polymerized F - actin relative to control ( Fig . 3 A ) . Confocal microscopy confirmed more intense F - actin – rich podosome staining and abnormal intracellular aggregates of WDR1 in patient moDCs ( Fig . 3 B ) . Although the num - ber of podosomes was similar , the volume of patient IV - 4’s podosomes was greater than control ( Fig . 3 C ) . Podosomes are cellular adhesion structures involved in matrix degra - dation and invasion , containing an F - actin core and a ring of cytoskeletal adaptor proteins , including WDR1 ( Cervero et al . , 2012 ) . Increased podosome volumes observed here are consistent with diminished F - actin depolymerization caused by defective WDR1 . In an attempt to model this , we transduced the THP1 monocytic cell line with shRNA against WDR1 or with a scrambled control . We produced two cell lines with different shRNA sequences that showed negligible WDR1 expression compared with untransduced cells and scrambled control . However , these cells showed no difference in actin polymer - ization assessed by flow cytometry ( Fig . S2 F ) . This phenome - non has been reported previously ; depleted WDR1 levels may lead to up - regulation of caspase 11 and cofilin , to partially rescue the defect ( Li et al . , 2007 ; Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . Furthermore , In the WDR1 rd / rd mouse the protein is also misfolded ( Kile et al . , 2007 ) , thus mutant rather than absent WDR1 is likely required for the autoinflammatory phenotype . Autoinflammation in the WDR1 rd / rd mouse is driven by IL - 18 independently of IL - 1 β . IL - 1 β and IL - 18 are activated by inflammasomes , and have both overlapping and divergent roles ( Brydges et al . , 2013 ) . Sera from both patients taken at three to five time points over 5 – 7 mo ( preHSCT ) demon - strated no change in IL - 1 β compared with healthy childhood controls ( Fig . 4 A ) , but did have elevated IL - 18 levels , which were higher than levels detected in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( sJIA ) patients ( Fig . 4 B ; Chen et al . , 2013 ) . In contrast to the sJIA patients , however , levels of IL - 18 – binding protein ( IL - 18BP ) were not elevated ( Fig . 4 C ) . IL - 18BP neutralizes the proinflammatory activity of IL - 18 , thus the low levels ob - served may contribute to the autoinflammatory phenotype ( Chen et al . , 2013 ; Dinarello et al . , 2013 ) . IL - 18 levels mirrored SAA and C - reactive protein ( CRP ) levels in IV - 2 , who was on anakinra when samples were taken ( Fig . 4 D ) , and were per - sistently elevated in IV - 4 ( not on anakinra ; Fig . 4 E ) . Although there was partial efficacy of anakinra in IV - 2 that could suggest a role for IL - 1 β in the human disease , we are intrigued by recent suggestions that anakinra may also partially antagonize IL - 18 ( Brydges et al . , 2013 ; Vastert et al . , 2014 ) . IL - 1 β levels are usually low in serum , even in IL - 1 β – mediated diseases , as it often acts locally and degrades rapidly . Therefore we also investigated IL - 1 β and IL - 18 production from the cultured moDCs treated with LPS for 4 h . We detected elevated IL - 18 production , but not IL - 1 β , from patient cells ( Fig . 4 , G and H ) in response to LPS . As before , polymerized F - actin levels were assessed using flow cytometry . Untreated moDCs from patient IV - 4 had 1 . 3 - fold F - actin intensity versus control , rising to 1 . 8 - fold after LPS treatment ( Fig . 4 I ) . We also detected signifi - cantly increased IL - 18 production from cultured neutrophils from IV - 4 compared with control when stimulated with LPS , but not in response to other experimental conditions ( Fig . 4 J ) . The neutrophil defects in these patients appeared relatively mild , as respiratory burst and phagocytosis were normal ( Table S1 ) . We further assessed neutrophil migratory function from patient IV - 4 using a modified Dunn chamber , and found no significant difference in velocity or chemotactic index ( Fig . 5 , A – C ) . Thus , alteration in neutrophil function alone is unlikely to account for the full disease phenotype . Although neutrophil chemotaxis was reduced , the presence of functional immuno - deficiency was not fully evaluated in the WDR1 rd / rd mouse , PFIT caused by mutation in WDR1 | Standing et al . 62 as mice were kept in a relatively protected environment ( Kile et al . , 2007 ; Kim et al . , 2015 ) . The ability of moDCs from pa - tient IV - 4 to phagocytose and process uncapsulated Neisseria meningitidis ( an actin - mediated process ; Jones et al . , 2008 ) was reduced ( Fig . 5 D ) , suggesting that the phagocytic defect may not affect all phagocytic cell types to the same extent , and may reflect a defect in the subsequent processing of antigen for presentation in DCs ( Savina and Amigorena , 2007 ) . Immunodeficiency in these patients is likely to be mul - tifactorial , given the manifold roles that podosomes and actin play in the immune system . Similar to Wiskott - Aldrich syn - drome , we observed a diminished T cell proliferative response to aCD3 stimulation , but intact PHA response ( Dupré et al . , 2002 ; Sasahara et al . , 2002 ; Bouma et al . , 2011 ; Calvez et al . , 2011 ; Malinova et al . , 2016 ) . This may not be surprising , given the importance of force generation for T cell activa - tion , and thus expected involvement of the actin cytoskele - ton ( Hu and Butte , 2016 ) . Given that IL - 18 activation in the WDR1 rd / rd mouse is dependent on the pyrin inflammasome ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) , we hypothesize that pyrin also interacts with WDR1 through its CARD domain . Murine caspase 11 ( equivalent to human caspases 4 and 5 ) expression is induced by LPS and then binds WDR1 to recruit cofilin and trigger F - actin depolymeriza - tion through a CARD domain ( Li et al . , 2007 ) . Caspases 4 , 5 and 11 can be activated by binding LPS directly , again through the CARD domains ( Hagar et al . , 2013 ; Shi et al . , 2014 ) . Pyrin and the ASC complex have previously been reported to di - rectly interact with polymerized actin ( Waite et al . , 2009 ) , and pyrin detects the Rho GTPase , modifying activity of bacterial toxins through downstream changes in the actin cytoskeleton and subsequently activates the pyrin inflammasome ( Flanna - Figure 2 . Protein structure of Wdr1 and predicted effect of l293F mutation . The WDR1 pdb file was downloaded from exPASY , and protein was viewed and manipulated with the Swiss PDB viewer . ( A ) The protein chain is colored from blue at the initiation of the N terminus of the protein to red . The two pro - pellers are labeled N and C , and the blades are numbered 1 – 14 . ( B ) A close up of the N - ter - minal propeller showing the leucine residue side chain in red in blade 7 , close to blade 1 ; and ( C ) the residue mutated to phenylalanine . Predicted H bonds with neighboring residues are shown ( D ) for leucine and ( E ) for phenyl - alanine . The L293F amino acid change occurs in blade 7 close to the tail of the N - terminal propeller , where the protein strand feeds into the join with the C - terminal propeller . Hy - drophobic interactions between blade 1 and 7 are important for closing the circular pro - peller structure of this domain ( Mohri et al . , 2004 ) . Each propeller blade is composed of four anti - parallel β - sheets ; in the wild - type protein , the leucine residue at position 293 is predicted to form three hydrogen bonds sup - porting this structure ( D ) . Mutating this res - idue to a phenylalanine disrupts these bonds ( E ) , with predicted functional consequences , as the two propellers mediate protein – protein interactions . Residues in the N terminus are important for F - actin binding and disassembly ( Mohri et al . , 2004 ) , whereas the C terminus interacts with the CARD domain of murine caspase - 11 ( a homologue of human caspases 4 and 5 ; Li et al . , 2007 ) . 63 JEM Vol . 214 , No . 1 gan et al . , 2012 ; Gavrilin et al . , 2012 ; Rosales - Reyes et al . , 2012 ; Xu et al . , 2014 ) . We speculate that WDR1 protein may be part of the link between these events . To begin to assess this , we cloned WDR1 mRNA from IV - 4 or a healthy con - trol into a pmCherry - N1 vector and transfected HEK293T cells . Although WT - WDR1 - mCherry exhibited a uniform distribution , the L293F - WDR1 - mCherry formed abnormal intense aggregates ( Fig . 3 D ) similar to those we observed in the patient moDCs ( Fig . 3B ) . We then studied co - localiza - tion of mutant or WT WDR1 with pyrin by co - transfection with pyrin - GFP . When introduced in the presence of L293F - WDR1 - mCherry , we confirmed that pyrin co - localized with mutant WDR1 aggregates ( Fig . 3 E ) . We speculate that this interaction may trigger spontaneous ASC speck formation , Figure 3 . F - actin levels and Wdr1 expression in patient and HeK293t cells . ( A ) Representative phalloidin staining of polymerized F - actin of cells from patient IV - 4 ( blue ) and control cells ( red ) using flow cytometry revealed increased F - actin in moDCs ( n = 3 ) , CD14 − lymphocytes ( n = 1 ) , and immortalized lymphoblasts from patient IV - 4 compared with control ( measured three times , compared with three controls ) . ( B ) Confocal microscopy of moDCs from patient IV - 4 and a healthy control stained with phalloidin ( green ) , anti - vinculin ( red ) , and anti - WDR1 ( blue ) revealed aberrant localization of WDR1 and bright staining of podosomes in cells from patient IV - 4 , performed once as patients underwent HSCT . Additional images are provided in Fig . S1 A . ( C ) Analysis of the podo - somes with Volocity software indicated that although podo - some number did not differ significantly between patient IV - 4 and control ( P = 0 . 1145 , two - tailed unpaired Student’s t test ) , podosome volume was significantly larger in patient IV - 4 ( * * * , P < 0 . 001 ; two - tailed unpaired Student’s t test ; error bars rep - resent the SEM ) . ( D ) WDR1 mRNA was cloned from patient IV - 4 or control , fused to the mCherry reporter , and expressed in HEK293T cells . Mutant WDR1 produced from the patient mRNA formed aggregates with markedly different intracellu - lar appearance compared with cells transfected with healthy control WDR1 mRNA . ( E ) When cotransfected with GFP - pyrin , the pyrin also localized to these WDR1 aggregates . Additional images provided in Fig . S1 B .

( A ) IL1 β was not significantly elevated in either patient compared with sera from healthy pediatric controls when measured on three separate occasions over several months . ( B ) In contrast , IL - 18 was significantly increased in both patients ( * * * , P < 0 . 0001 , two - tailed unpaired Student’s t test for both ) . IL - 18 was also significantly elevated in the serum of sJIA patients ( n = 6 ) compared with controls ( * * , P = 0 . 0023 , two - tailed unpaired Student’s t test ) who also showed increased levels of IL - 18BP in the same samples ( P = 0 . 0343 , two - tailed unpaired Student’s t test ) , which was not observed in either patient ( C ) . ( D ) In patient IV - 2 , IL - 18 mirrored CRP and serum amyloid A ( SAA ) levels ; but was persistently elevated in IV - 4 , even when CRP and SAA were normal ( E ; IL - 18 measured by ELI SA ) . ( F ) Caspase - 1 activation , measured as the proportion of FLI CA + cells by flow cytometry was significantly elevated in CD14 + cells from both patients ( n = 2 ) compared with controls ( n = 4 ) and CAPS patients ( n = 5 ) at baseline and after stimulation with LPS and staurosporine ( * , P < 0 . 05 ; * * , P < 0 . 01 , two - tailed unpaired Student’s t tests ) . ( G ) IL - 1 β levels produced by moDCs after 4 h at baseline or upon treatment with LPS showed little difference between cells from control and patient IV - 4 , but IL - 18 levels in the same supernatant were much higher in patient IV - 4 ( H ) . Experiment was performed once , as patient cells were limited because this patient underwent HSCT . ( I ) In the moDCs from this same experiment , the relative amount of polymerized F - actin in these same moDCs from patient IV - 4 was higher compared with control moDCs , and increased even further upon stimulation with LPS ( error bars represent experimental replicates from reciprocal staining with CFSE ) .

We investigated heterozy - gous family members and found no increase in polymerized phalloidin levels , inflammasome activation , or IL - 18 produc - tion in their cells ( Fig . S2 ) . This confirms that the phenotype is recessive , even if this mutation has an activating component it cannot manifest without complete loss of wild - type pro - tein function . We also do not have data on the comparative binding kinetics of wild - type and mutated protein and how they interact when both are present . This warrants further study in the future . Because activation of the pyrin inflam - masome culminates in caspase - 1 activation , we measured this using the FLI CA assay and flow cytometry gating on CD14 + Figure 5 . Migratory capacity of neutrophils and phagocytosis of uncapsulated n . meningitidis by modcs . Neutrophils isolated from patient IV - 4 and control showed no significant difference in migratory capacity in regards to instantaneous angle of migration ( A ) , velocity ( B ) , or chemotactic index ( C ) . Experiment performed once as patients underwent HSCT . Example traces of migrating cells are shown in D . Bar , 100 µm . ( E ) Patient IV - 4 and control moDCs were incubated with FITC - labeled uncapsulated N . meningitidis ( FITC - nm ; green ) . After 4 h , cells were fixed and labeled with TOPR0 - 3 nuclear stain ( blue ) , and anti - P1 . 7 antibodies ( red ) which only labels the surface of any bacteria external to the cells , thus identifying bacteria that have not been phagocytosed . After 4 h , control cells had phagocytosed nearly all the FITC - nm and transported them adjacent to the nucleus , whereas fewer of the patient moDCs had completed this process . The mean proportion of control moDCs undergoing phagocytosis was 0 . 56 ( SD = 0 . 18 ) versus 0 . 22 ( SD = 0 . 11 ) , performed once on moDCs from patient IV - 4 ( P = 0 . 04 ; unpaired t test ) . PFIT caused by mutation in WDR1 | Standing et al . 66 cells from PBMCs , and found greater caspase - 1 activation in both patients at baseline and after stimulation compared with healthy controls and patients with cryopyrin - associated periodic syndrome ( CAPS ) , who are known to have sponta - neous NLRP3 - inflammasome activation and high caspase - 1 ( Fig . 4 F ) . Similar to the murine model , these results confirm that caspase - 1 activation and elevated IL - 18 are likely to be central to the pathogenesis of autoinflammation in humans caused by mutated WDR1 protein . We observed ultrastructural abnormalities of mega - karyocytes in patient IV - 4 ( Fig . 1 D ) , revealing occasional small , atypical megakaryocytes , with no nucleus and failure of the development of the demarcating membrane system . The thrombocytopenia we observed could thus be explained by dysfunctional platelet shedding , because WDR1 is required for megakaryocyte maturation and platelet shedding in the WDR1 rd / rd mouse ( Kile et al . , 2007 ) . In conclusion , homozygous missense L153F / L293F mutation in the actin regulatory gene WDR1 causes a new AID in humans , with periodic fevers , immunodeficiency , and intermittent thrombocytopenia ( PFIT ) . The human disease resembles the murine WDR1 rd / rd mouse model caused by hypomorphic recessive WDR1 mutations ( Kile et al . , 2007 ; Kim et al . , 2015 ) , and this highlights a potentially crucial link between the actin cytoskeleton and autoinflammation . New questions now arise regarding the precise molecular mecha - nisms governing WDR1 activity and the human PFIT phe - notype . Although we cannot yet conclude that PFIT is driven purely by IL - 18 , our data do suggest an important role for this proinflammatory cytokine , driven by caspase - 1 activation . Targeted IL - 18 blockade , if available , might have been a more effective strategy to treat the autoinflammatory component of the disease . In the WDR1 rd / rd mouse , transplant of bone mar - row cells from wild - type mice corrected the autoinflammatory phenotype and macrothrombocytopenia ; the same appears to be true in PFIT , as allogeneic HSCT cured patient IV - 4 . Given that severe autoinflammation coexists with immunodeficiency and thrombocytopenia in PFIT , for the time being , we suggest that HSCT is the most appropriate treatment . MaterIals and MetHods experiments This study was approved by the Bloomsbury ethics committee ( ethics number 08H071382 ) ; we obtained written informed consent from all the family members and controls who par - ticipated . In vitro studies were performed in CD14 + moDCs , CD14 − lymphocytes , neutrophils , and EBV immortalized B cells from patients and controls . Confocal microscopy was performed in HEK293T cells transfected with WDR1 cloned from the mRNA of patient IV - 4 or of a healthy WT control , and fused to the mCherry reporter ; and with GFP - pyrin . Granule release assay The granule release assay was performed according to Wheeler et al . ( 2010 ) . PBMCs were stimulated with IL - 2 overnight , and then incubated with FITC - conjugated anti - CD107a antibody alone , or with anti - CD3 antibody or PHA , for 2 h . Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry and gating on lymphocytes by forward / side scatter . CD107a expression was analyzed on cytotoxic T cells ( CD8 + and CD3 + ) and on NK cells ( CD56 + and CD3 − ) , and the increase in percent - age of CD107a + cells between unstimulated and stimulated samples was calculated . PHa and cd3 stimulation PHa stimulation . Whole blood was stimulated with PHA ( In - verness Medical ) , which preferentially stimulates T helper ( CD4 ) cells via the IL - 2 receptor , to assess an immune re - sponse . The blood was diluted 1 : 20 with RPMI - 1640 ( Life Technologies ) . 200 µl of cell suspension was pipetted into 10 wells . The first two wells were untreated ; the remaining eight wells had PHA added to duplicate wells in concentrations of 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 µg / ml . The plate was incubated at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 for 4 or 3 d . cd3 stimulation . Lymphocytes were separated from whole blood using lymphoprep ( Alere ) , and the cells were then cul - tured at a concentration of 10 6 / ml with 10 % AB serum in RPMI with and without anti - CD3 at a final concentration of 0 . 3 µg / ml ( eBioscience ) in triplicate , then incubated at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 for 4 d . For both assays to measure the proliferation , 10 µl ( 1 μ Cur ) of tritiated thymidine ( PerkinElmer ) was added to each of the wells , and the plate was returned to the incubator for 4 h . Any actively dividing cells incorporated the tritiated thymidine . The plates were then harvested ( FilterMate cell harvester ; PerkinElmer ) and the radioactivity was counted using the β counter ( TopCount β counter ; PerkinElmer ) . The amount of proliferation was demonstrated by the amount of tritiated thymidine incorporation into the cells measured by CPM on the β counter . Control samples were always set up alongside patient samples . For PHA stimulation , control results should be < 400 CPM for 0 µg / ml PHA and > 12 , 500 for the highest CPM . For CD3 stimulation , control results should be < 600 CPM without anti - CD3 and > 6 , 000 with anti - CD3 . neutrophil phagocytosis assay Neutrophil phagocytosis at 2 , 5 , and 10 min was analyzed in whole blood using the Glycotope Phagoburst Assay ( BD ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . A normal range was established using 50 healthy individuals , and a normal control was run with each sample . electron microscopy of bone marrow aspirate EDTA bone marrow samples were centrifuged to form buffy coat preparations . These were fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaral - dehyde in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer , followed by secondary fixation in 1 . 0 % osmium tetroxide . Samples were dehydrated in graded ethanol , transferred to propylene oxide , and then infiltrated and embedded in Agar 100 epoxy resin . Polym - 67 JEM Vol . 214 , No . 1 erization was at 60°C for 48 h . 90 - nm ultrathin sections were cut using a Diatome diamond knife on a Leica Ul - tracut UCT ultramicrotome . Sections were picked up on copper grids and stained with alcoholic uranyl acetate and lead citrate . The samples were examined in a JEOL 1400 transmission electron microscope and images recorded using an AMT XR80 digital camera . Genetic mapping and sequencing 200 ng genomic DNA from patients , siblings , and the parents was isothermally amplified and enzymatically fragmented before hybridization to Illumina Human610 - Quad arrays overnight . These were imaged using the Illumina iScan . The regions of homozygosity were identified using Illumina’s Beadstudio with the Loss of heterozygosity detector plug - in ( version 1 . 0 . 3 ) ; the minimum number of contiguous homo - zygous SNPs was set to 100 . Whole - exome sequencing was completed using the TruSeq exome kit ( version 2 ; Illumina ) and sequenced on the HiSeq2000 ( Illumina ) . The raw sequence data were aligned to the human reference genome using the Burrows - Wheeler Aligner ( BWA ) alignment algorithm . Variant calling was with the Genome Analysis ToolKit ( GATK ) . Variant annotation was with ANN OVAR and SNP EFF . The WDR1 variant was confirmed and familial seg - regation ascertained by PCR and Sanger sequencing using the following primers to amplify and sequence exon 8 for - ward : 5 ′ - ACT CTG GTC TCT TCC CTG TCC - 3 ′ and re - verse : 5 ′ - TTT GGG GTC TCT CTC CAG TC - 3 ′ . Sequencing was completed with the AB3730 using the BigDye v3 . 1 kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . The WDR1 pdb file was downloaded from ex - PASY , and protein was viewed and manipulated with Swiss PDB viewer . PBMc and neutrophil separation Blood was collected into Falcon tubes ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) containing 35 U preservative - free heparin ( CP Pharmaceuticals ) per 50 ml . 2 ml of a 5 % dextran - saline solution was added per 10 ml of blood and gently mixed by inversion before being left to sediment for 30 min . The plasma layer was collected and overlaid on an equal vol - ume of Ficoll - Paque reagent , and then centrifuged 800 g for 10 min with the brake off . The PBMC layer was taken for CD14 + cell selection , and the neutrophil pellet was re - suspended in distilled water for 20 s before addition of 2× saline solution to restore isotonicity . The neutrophils were then centrifuged at 1 , 200 rpm for 7 min and resuspended in warm RPMI with 10 % FCS . Monocyte and lymphocyte separation CD14 + cells were magnetically labeled and positively selected on LS columns ( Miltenyi Biotec ) . The CD14 − lymphoctyes were collected in column flow - through . CD14 + cells were eluted from the column for moDC generation . modc generation CD14 + cells were cultured in the presence of 10 ng / ml re - combinant human IL - 4 ( rhIL - 4 ) and 10 ng / ml recombinant human granulocyte - macrophage colony stimulating factor for 6 d . Cells were split on days 2 and 5 , with addition of fresh cytokines . On day 6 or 7 , both adherent and suspension cells were harvested for use . B - lymphoblastoid cell lines ( B - lcl ) generation EBV viral supernatant was produced from the B95 - 8 cell line , which releases high titers of transforming EBV . This virus was then used to establish human lymphoblastoid lines . In brief , on day 0 , 2 . 5 × 10 7 B95 - 8 cells were suspended in 15 ml ( 1 . 67 × 10 6 / ml ) of RF10 ( RPMI 1640 + 10 % FCS and pen / strep ) and added to the small compartment of a CL 1000 flask ( CELLine ) . The nutrient compartment was filled with 1 liter of nutrient medium ( RPMI 1640 ; 5 % FCS and pen / strep ) . After incubation for 1 wk at 37°C , cells were harvested , spun at 400 g for 5 min , and the supernatant was removed , before being resuspended in 15 ml RF10 and returned to the cell compartment after the removal of the nutrient medium . This was replaced with 1 liter of RPMI and pen / strep , and no serum was added to encourage the virus release . On day 16 , the cells were harvested and spun at 450 g for 20 min . The supernatant was collected and was spun again at 450 g for 20 min . The supernatant was then passed through a 0 . 45 - µm filter and stored at – 80°C . 5 × 10 6 PBMCs were pelleted and 200 µl of EBV viral supernatant was added , followed by 1 . 8 ml of RF10 with 1 µg / ml of ciclosporin to prevent cytotoxic T cell killing . 5 × 10 5 cells ( 200 µl ) were cultured in five wells of a 96 - well plate . An additional 1 ml of RF10 with ciclosporin was added to the remaining cells , and 200 µl was plated in 10 more wells . After 7 d , 100 µl of medium in each well was replaced with fresh RF10 . The culture was monitored and the medium replaced once it had turned yellow , until the point was reached where this was required every day and large cell clumps could be clearly seen . Then three wells were combined into one well of a 24 - well plate with 1 . 4 ml of RF10 . Again , these were expanded until the media needed to be replaced daily , and then transferred to a T25 with 5 ml RF10 and 100 µM acyclovir to kill any re - maining virus . RF10 and acyclovir was added every 4 – 5 d and after 1 – 2 wk , transferred to a T75 . These were split every 4 – 5 d . F - actin quantification by flow cytometry Flow cytometry of F - actin was performed in moDCs ; CD14 - negative lymphocytes ; and B - LCLs from patient IV - 4 , and healthy controls . Patient and control cells were stained concurrently to control for any potential differences aris - ing during the staining process . One population was labeled with a cell tracker ( carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester [ CFSE ] or Dichloro - Dimethylacridin - 2 - One succinimidyl ester [ DDAO - SE ] ; Molecular Probes ) for 15 min in RPMI at 37°C , whereas the other was incubated in RPMI alone . This was performed reciprocally . Cells were fixed in 4 % PFA for PFIT caused by mutation in WDR1 | Standing et al . 68 20 min , during which time the populations were mixed , then permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min . Cells were incubated with phalloidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor - 488 ( DDAO ) or Alexa Fluor - 647 ( CFSE ; Molecular Probes ) di - luted 1 / 200 in PBS for 45 min and analyzed using the CyAn ADP Analyzer ( Beckman Coulter ) . confocal microscopy of modcs 100 , 000 moDCs were seeded onto coverslips coated in poly L - lysine and allowed to settle for 45 min . These were fixed with 4 % PFA for 20 min , and then permeabilized with 0 . 5 % triton X for 5 min . After this , nonspecific binding was blocked with donkey serum for 1 h . Coverslips were then incubated with goat anti - WDR1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and rab - bit anti - vinculin ( Abcam ) for 45 min , and , subsequently , Alexa Fluor - 568 anti - rabbit and Alexa Fluor - 647 anti – goat sec - ondaries plus phalloidin - 488 ( Life Technologies ) . These were mounted with aquapolymount and imaged using the LSM 710 confocal microscope ( ZEI SS ) with 63× objective ( Plan - Apo - chromat ; numerical aperture , 1 . 4 ; working distance , 190 µm ; imaging medium , oil ) with Zen2009 software ( ZEI SS ) . Wdr1 mrna cloning RNA was extracted from control and patient IV - 4 B - LCL using TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) as per the manufacturer’s instruc - tions , and reverse transcribed with the high - capacity RNA to cDNA kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . WDR1 transcript was PCR amplified , and restriction sites were added using Phusion high fidelity polymerase ( NEB ) , and the following primers : for - ward ( XhoI ) 5 ′ - CGC TCG AGA TGC CGT ACG AGA TCA AG - 3 ′ ; and reverse ( BamHI ) 5 ′ - CCG GAT CCT CTG AGG TGA TTG TCC - 3 ′ . The resultant PCR product was digested with FastDigest BamHI and XhoI ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 15 min at 37°C . The pmCherry - N1 plasmid was also di - gested with BamHI and XhoI . The digests were size - selected on a 0 . 7 % TAE agarose gel and purified using the minelute gel extraction kit ( QIA GEN ) . 50 ng of plasmid was annealed with 60 ng PCR insert ( a molar ratio of 1 : 3 ) using T4 DNA ligase ( NEB ) . This was transformed into TOP10 ( Invitrogen ) chemically competent E . coli as per the manufacturer’s in - structions and plated onto Luria Broth ( LB ) plates containing 100 µg / ml ampicillin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and grown at 37°C overnight . Six colonies of control and patient sequence were grown overnight in 5 ml of LB containing ampicillin , and the plasmid was purified using QIAprep spin miniprep kit ( QIA GEN ) , as per the manufacturer’s instructions . One plasmid containing wild - type WDR1 sequence and one plasmid con - taining the WDR1 sequence from patient IV - 4 were selected for sequencing and grown in large culture for maxiprep using the GenElute HP maxiprep kit ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Each of these were transfected into HEK293T cells . reverse transfection of HeK293t cells 1 µg of the relevant WDR1 - containing plasmid was added per transfection to 50 µl of opti - MEM ( Gibco ) and 3 µl of FuGENE HD ( Promega ) , and incubated for 10 min before dispensing into a 24 - well plate . 100 , 000 HEK293T cells in 500 µl RPMI with 10 % FCS were then added and incu - bated for 24 h before imaging with a fluorescent microscope . For the double transfection , 1 µg of GFP - tagged pyrin in the pCMV6 - AC - GFP vector ( OriGene ) was included in the transfection . The cells were seeded on polylysine - coated coverslips , and , after 24 h , were fixed with 4 % PFA for 20 min and mounted with DAPI containing anti - fade mount - ing medium ( VEC TAS HIE LD ) . Z - stacks through cells were imaged using the LSM 710 ( ZEI SS ) confocal microscope as described for moDCs . Measurement of cytokines IL - 1 β and IL - 18 cytokine levels were measured in the serum of patients and controls , and in supernatants of in vitro exper - iments using the ready - set - go human IL - 1 β ELI SA kit ( eBio - science ) , and IL - 18 instant ELI SA kit ( eBioscience ) as per the manufacturer’s instructions . IL - 18 was also measured using a Meso Scale Discovery ( MSD ) multiplex kit ( Meso Scale Di - agnostics ) , as per the manufacturer’s instructions in patients , controls , and sJIA patients . IL - 18BP was measured using ELI SA ( R & D Systems ) following the manufacturer’s method . Control sera was obtained from healthy pediatric controls ob - tained for the development of diagnostic tests for primary im - munodeficiency ( REC reference 06 / Q0508 / 16 ; n = 22 ; 13 males ; median age , 5 yr ; range , 0 . 3 – 16 yr ) . Sera was obtained from six sJIA patients ( n = 6 ; three males ; median age , 11 . 5 yr ; range , 6 – 15 yr ; two with active disease , all on treatment ) . caspase - 1 activity PBMCs were obtained from patients CAPS ( n = 5 ; three males ; median age , 3 yr ; range , 2 . 5 – 7 . 3 yr ; 1 with chronic in - fantile neurological and cutaneous ( CIN CA ) syndrome ; and 4 with Muckle Wells Syndrome ; CAPS disease activity score median 1 / 20 , range 0 – 4 / 20 ; all treated with canakinumab ) ; and from four healthy adult controls . PBMCs were seeded in a 96 - well plate at a density of 1 . 6 × 10 5 cells / well ( 8 . 0 × 10 5 cells / ml ) . Relevant wells were primed with 100 ng / ml LPS for 4 h , and , if required , then stimulated with 5 mM ATP for 30 min . Additional wells were treated with 2 µM staurosporine for 4 h as positive control . Caspase - 1 activity was measured using FLI CA ( Im - munoChemistry Technologies ) , a cell - permeable fluorescent probe ( FAM - YVAD - FMK ) that binds active caspase - 1 . Cells were incubated for 1 h with FLI CA at 37°C and stained with PE - conjugated anti - CD14 ( BD ) to identify monocytes . The gating strategy consisted of including live CD14 + cells , which were subsequently analyzed for the frequency of FLI CA + cells . dc phagocytosis assay moDCs were resuspended at 5 × 10 5 / ml in RPMI and 10 % FCS . moDCs ( 100 µl ) were then co - cultured with an FITC - labeled unencapsulated mutant of N . meningitidis H44 / 76 ( siaD ) , at a multiplicity of infection of 100 . Cells 69 JEM Vol . 214 , No . 1 were then incubated for 4 h at 37°C , and then harvested after a series of PBS washes . The residual cell pellet was vortexed , and 20 µl was spotted onto adhesion slides ( VWR ) and left for 10 min to adhere , washed with PBS , and fixed for 10 min in 4 % PFA . Slides were stored at − 20°C until staining with 10 mg / ml P1 . 7 antibodies specific for N . meningitidis H44 / 76 ( NIB SC ) , followed by Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti – mouse IgG ( Life Technologies ) and TO - PRO - 3 ( Molecular Probes ; Jones et al . , 2007 ) . The proportion of moDCs that were undergoing phagocytosis was calculated from fields of cells containing at least eight nuclei . A phagocytic event was scored a FITC cluster near the nucleus in the absence of the red P1 . 7 signal . neutrophil migration assay Coverslips were coated with a 25 mg / ml fibrinogen for 1 h at 37°C , and then washed twice with PBS . 10 5 neutrophils were left to adhere to the coated coverslip for 30 min . The coverslip was then washed once with medium . A chemokine gradient was established within the Dunn chamber by filling the outside well with 80 µl of 1 % agarose gel containing 100 nM formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine chemokine and leaving it to polymerize for 2 min . The inner well was filled with 50 µl of the media without chemokine , and then the chamber was completed , placing the coverslip with the neu - trophils over the top . The chamber was then sealed with wax . Migration was imaged at 37°C on an Axiovert 135 micro - scope ( ZEI SS ) equipped with a motorized stage that captured one image per minute for 1 h . The movie was quantified by using ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health ) and Ibidi analysis software . Velocity is the mean of all the instantaneous veloc - ities ( ratio between the distance d and time t ) between two successive time points : v = 1 ( n − 1 ) Σ ( ( d ( pi , pi + 1 ) ) ∕ ( Δ t ) ) n − 1 i = 1 . Chemotactic index ( CI ) is the ratio between the net distance ( direct distance between the starting point and the ending point ) and the total distance ( sum of distances the cell traveled between two time points ) : CI = d ( p1 , pn ) Σ d ( n − 1 i = 1 pi ⁄ , pi + 1 ) . The instantaneous angle is the angle between the direction of the chemoattractant gradient and the direction traveled by the cell between two time points : α i = arc tan ( ( yi + 1 2 yi ) ( xi + 1 2 pi ) ) . shrna - mediated knock - down of Wdr1 in tHP1 cells Six lentiviral shRNAs against WDR1 were ordered from Open Biosystems pGIPZ shRNAmir library through the UCL RNAi core . Virus was produced in HEK293T cells and used to transduce into the THP1 monocytic cell line , as previously described ( Naldini et al . , 1996 ) . Stably transduced lines were obtained using selection with Puromycin . Knock - down of WDR1 was validated by Western blot . statistical analyses All statistics ( ANO VA and unpaired Student’s t tests ) and graphs were produced using Prism version 4 ( GraphPad ) . P > 0 . 05 was considered significant . online supplemental material Fig . S1 provides additional examples of microscopy images of moDCs and transfected 293T HEK cells shown in Fig . 3 . Fig . S2 shows the phenotype in heterozygous individuals and in THP1 cells with WDR1 knockdown did not differ from wild - type in several parameters . Table S1 elucidates in more detail the treatments and immunological tests received by the two patients . Regions of genetic homozygosity found in both of these patients and not in the siblings or parents are listed in Table S2 . acKnoWledGMents This work was funded by the Nuffield Foundation Oliver Bird program and the Rosetrees Trust ( A .
