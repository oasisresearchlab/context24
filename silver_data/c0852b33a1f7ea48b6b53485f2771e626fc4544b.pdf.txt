LETTERS Sleep and sensorimotor integration during early vocal learning in a songbird Sylvan S . Shank 1 & Daniel Margoliash 1 , 2 Behavioural studies widely implicate sleep in memory consolida - tion in the learning of a broad range of behaviours 1 – 4 . During sleep , brain regions are reactivated 5 , 6 , and specific patterns of neural activity are replayed 7 – 10 , consistent with patterns observed in previous waking behaviour . Birdsong learning is a paradigmatic model system for skill learning 11 – 14 . Song development in juvenile zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata ) is characterized by sleep - dependent circadian fluctuations in singing behaviour , with immediate post - sleep deterioration in song structure followed by recovery later in the day 15 . In sleeping adult birds , spontaneous bursting activity of forebrain premotor neurons in the robust nucleus of the arcopallium ( RA ) carries information about day - time singing 16 . Here we show that , in juvenile zebra finches , play - back during the day of an adult ‘tutor’ song induced profound and tutor - song - specific changes in bursting activity of RA neurons during the following night of sleep . The night - time neuronal changes preceded tutor - song - induced changes in singing , first observed the following day . Interruption of auditory feedback greatly reduced sleep bursting and prevented the tutor - song - specific neuronal remodelling . Thus , night - time neuronal activity is shaped by the interaction of the song model ( sensory template ) and auditory feedback , with changes in night - time activity preced - ing the onset of practice associated with vocal learning . We hypo - thesize that night - time bursting induces adaptive changes in premotor networks during sleep as part of vocal learning . By this hypothesis , adaptive changes driven by replay of sensory informa - tion at night and by evaluation of sensory feedback during the day interact to produce the complex circadian patterns seen early in vocal development . To explore the role of sleep in the early phases of song learning , we characterized the properties of single RA neurons in head - fixed , sleeping juvenile zebra finches during nights before and after the onset of tutor song exposure . Sleep was defined on the basis of beha - vioural and electroencephalographic criteria ( see Supplementary Information ) 17 . During sleep , RA neurons tended to discharge irre - gularly or ‘burst’ , as seen in distributions of inter - spike intervals ( ISIs ; Fig . 1a , black curve ) 16 . Starting on the night after the first day of exposure to the tutor song , there was a sharp increase in the amount of high - frequency spiking activity ( Fig . 1a , red curve ) . Across all birds , we quantified the effect of tutor song exposure as a normalized change in the percentage of ISIs # 40 ms , which showed a significant increase starting on the night after the first day of tutor song exposure and persisted thereafter ( Fig . 1b ) . A significant result was also obtained considering firing rates that were normalized by linearly scaling the ISIs for each cell ( P 5 0 . 02 , repeated measures analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) , a 5 0 . 05 ; Fig . 1b , open circles ) . This verified that the increase in high - frequency activity was not depen - dent on changes in mean spike rates after tutoring , but was the result of a specific increase in high - frequency activity including bursting . Within each bird there was some variation in the amount of high - frequency activity of RA cells on nights after the onset of song learn - ing , but the tendency towards shorter ISIs was apparent in most cells ( Fig . 1c ) . Emerging RA bursting activity , furthermore , was shaped by the specific tutor song that a bird heard . Nightly mean ISI distributions were calculated for all RA neurons recorded for each bird after tutor song exposure ( which showed little difference from night to night ; Fig . 2c ) , and nightly mean distributions were averaged together to generate one mean curve per bird . For the resulting post - exposure curves , within the high - frequency range ( ISIs # 40 ms ) , the shapes— as assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients—were more sim - ilar in birds hearing the same tutor song than in birds hearing dif - ferent tutor songs ( see Supplementary Information ) . This grouping of ISI distribution shapes by tutor song can be visualized by compar - ing the average ISI distributions for individual birds on nights before tutor song exposure to those on nights after tutor song exposure ( Fig . 2a , black and coloured lines , respectively ) . The differences between groups can be visualized by comparing global average ISI distributions—one for each group of birds hearing a given tutor song ( Fig . 2b ) . Once a bird was exposed to a tutor song , a prototypical post - exposure ISI distribution shape was quickly obtained and then main - tained . To quantify this , we compared ( using Pearson correlations ) the nightly ISI distributions ( # 40 ms ) for each bird before and after song exposure to the corresponding global mean curve ( Fig . 2b ) , excluding data from the bird being analysed from the global mean distributions . Before tutor song exposure , both the within - and between - group comparisons ( Fig . 2d , black and grey dots , respect - ively ) had large variability and were not significantly different from each other on any night ( P 5 0 . 25 to P 5 0 . 73 ) . By the first night after tutor song exposure , ISI distributions had already assumed their post - exposure shape , showing increased Pearson correlations with much lower variability ( Fig . 2d , red dots ) , whereas the across - group correlations did not increase ( Fig . 2d , pink dots ) . These differences were statistically significant starting from the first night ( P 5 0 . 0082 , two - tailed t - test , a 5 0 . 05 ) , and continued to show a significant dif - ference throughout the post - exposure period ( P , 0 . 05 for 8 out of 11 post - exposure nights ; see also Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , emphasizing that stable changes in ISI distributions were rapidly achieved and then maintained in the days after tutor song exposure . Zebra finches begin singing as early as 25 days of age 18 , so our , 40 - day - old birds had extensive sensorimotor experience before neural recordings were performed . To explore the influence of singing and auditory feedback on the structure of RA neuronal bursting , we performed two additional experiments . We prevented singing by surgically muting two birds ( a third bird , M2 , sang in spite of the surgery ) , and raised a second group of four birds in continuous 100 dB white noise environments to suppress auditory feedback . 1 Department of Psychology , 2 Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy , University of Chicago , Chicago , Illinois 60637 , USA .

All rights reserved ©2009 All seven birds cued tutor song playback ; for birds in the white noise environments , thisalso briefly eliminated themasking noise . Anoise - cancellation technique allowed us to qualitatively assess the amount of singing in white noise conditions ( Fig . 3e ) . The absence of auditory feedback had large effects on RA sleep bursting . Even before the onset of tutor song exposure , experimental birds showed notably reduced levels of bursting activity compared to birds with intact auditory feedback . ISI distributions showed suppressed short - duration ISIs for all six feedback - deprived birds ( that is , excluding M2 ; 14 nights , 65 cells ; Fig . 3a , lower black line ) compared to birds with normal feedback ( n 5 13 birds , 38 nights , 163 cells ; Fig . 3a , upper black line ) . Considering ISIs # 40 ms , these dif - ferences were significant ( P 5 0 . 03 , two - tailed t - test on arcsin - trans - formed data , a 5 0 . 05 ) . The absence of feedback also disrupted the changes in RA induced by sensory exposure . In feedback - deprived birds , tutor song exposure did not induce an increase in bursting activity ( comparing ISIs # 40 ms before to those after exposure , P 5 0 . 45 , two - tailed t - test on arcsin - transformed data , a 5 0 . 05 , n 5 6 birds , 31 nights , 151 cells ) . Furthermore , on the nights after tutor song exposure , high - frequency bursting was greatly suppressed in feedback - deprived birds ( n 5 6 birds , 18 nights , 98 cells ; Fig . 3b , lower red line ) com - pared with normal birds ( Fig . 3b , upper red line ; P 5 0 . 04 , two - tailed t - test on arcsin - transformed data , a 5 0 . 05 ) . Subsequent recovery of sensorimotor feedback released RA neurons to rapidly recover to normal patterns .

The white noise was turned off for a portion of the fourth day of tutor song exposure ( turned off for the first three hours , n 5 2 birds ; turned off for the last five hours , n 5 2 birds ) and then turned off completely starting on the fifth day . In two birds that sang robustly during white noise exposure ( one released from white noise at the start of the day , the other at the end of the day ) , during sleep on the night after the fourth day of exposure , the expected tutor - song - specific ISI distribu - tions were observed in the activity of RA neurons for the first time . A third robust singer also showed the expected shift , but only on the following night ( Fig . 3d ) . Singing was suppressed in the fourth bird ( white noise ( WN ) 4 ) throughout the period of white noise exposure and showed a robust increase only by the fourth day after white noise was turned off . Concomitantly , sleep bursting of RA neurons also remained suppressed for those three additional nights , and then on the night after that first day of singing RA neurons expressed bursting with an ISI distribution appropriate for song 1 ( r 5 0 . 92 1 0 . 04 , – 0 . 08 within - group on the two nights post - singing onset versus r 5 0 . 16 1 0 . 39 , – 0 . 46 for the three nights before singing onset ) . The mean ISI curve for all four birds ( n 5 17 nights , 84 cells ) , representing only the data collected after white noise was turned off ( n 5 3 birds ) or after white noise was turned off and singing had commenced ( for WN4 ) , was typical of birds exposed to song 1 with normal feedback ( Fig . 3c , upper red curve ) . Analysis of the fine structure of vocal development further demon - strated the tight temporal correlation between song development and night - time bursting . We examined the entropy variance—a measure of song complexity that shows an upward developmental trend track - ing song learning 15 —for all song segments each bird sang each day . By this measure , songs gained structure in a saltatory manner on the second day of tutor song exposure ( P 5 0 . 006 , repeated measures ANOVA , a 5 0 . 05 ; Fig . 4a ) 19 . The increase in entropy variance on the second day of training was not present with the first vocalizations of that day . Instead , the increase seen on the second day was achieved across singing in the early part of the day . On days before tutor song exposure and on the first day of exposure , there was no significant increase in entropy variance across morning singing ( Fig . 4b , c , see Supplementary Information for statistical analysis ) . However , start - ing on the second day of exposure and on the days thereafter , birds showed a clear increase in entropy variance across the early part of the day ( Fig . 4b , c ) , similar to what has been reported previously 15 , 20 , and this was significant ( see Supplementary Information ) . Because birds vocalized on the first day of song tutoring before and after they cued tutor song playback , however , this could confound the implications of changes in night - time RA bursting if the birds modified their songs on the first day but only after tutor song exposure , and this was not reflected in mean changes for that day . Analysis of singing at the end of the day , analysis of the most complex songs and analysis of singing immediately after tutoring , however , all failed to support this alterna - tive explanation ( Supplementary Information ) . In birdsong learning , memories of conspecific songs are acquired early in development and act as a referent to guide subsequent aud - itory - feedback - dependent sensorimotor learning 12 – 14 , 21 – 24 . In an influential account of this process , the acquired memory of song was envisioned to act as a ‘sensory template’ , directly matching aud - itory feedback arising from singing with the sensory representation of the memorised song guiding changes in vocal output 13 , 25 . We found that the effects of tutor song exposure were immediate , profound and distributed—expressed as rapid , fundamental and long - lasting changes in song - specific high - frequency spiking activity in a fore - brain nucleus one synapse from the motor nucleus innervating the syrinx . The isolation rearing our birds experienced before tutor song exposure is likely to have enhanced the magnitude of these effects beyond what would otherwise be seen in normally raised birds 26 . Nevertheless , the timing and song - type specificity of the changes are consistent with the action of a song ( sensory ) memory influ - encing the functional organization of a motor circuit 27 , although a causal link has yet to be established . The rapidity of changes in RA sleep activity and its subsequent stability bolsters the idea that the sensory representation was quickly established , opening a ‘gate’ or enabling a dormant circuit , and that song development proceeded with the sensory representation expressed at night guiding changes in daytime premotor patterns . This motivates a new hypothesis : sensory memories can act indirectly ( offline ) on sensorimotor performance by means of spontaneous activity . We speculate that during sleep , changes in the RA network ( ‘con - solidation’ ) reflect updating of sensory memories . Night - time changes would establish a new configuration in the RA network . The following morning , plastic responses released by singing subsequent to night - time reconfiguration might first drive the network away from stability before it recovers stability with additional iterations ; this could explain 0 8 kHz Call Song syllables Microphone recording Noise - cancelled signal a b c d e 1 s Cell number 0 . 04 0 . 02 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 20 30 l o g [ I S I ( m s ) ] Song training onset White noise turned off P r o b a b ili t y d e n s i t y P r o b a b ili t y d e n s i t y WN off ISI ( ms ) P r o b a b ili t y d e n s i t y No singing / auditory feedback No singing / auditory feedback WN on ISI ( ms ) 0 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 0 . 01 0 . 018 1 10 0 0 . 004 0 . 008 40 Intactbirds Intactbirds Intactbirds ISI ( ms ) 1 10 40 1 10 40 Pre - exposure Post - exposure Figure 3 | RAsleepactivityinabsenceofauditoryfeedback ( whitenoiseor muted ) . a , ISIdistributionsbeforetutorsongexposure , averagedacrosstwo muted birds and four birds raised in white noise ( lower black line ) , and averaged ( for comparison ) across 13 birds with normal feedback ( upper black line ) . b , Birds exposed to white noise and those that were muted fail to show tutor - song - specific ISI distributions after song exposure .

All rights reserved ©2009 the non - monotonic changes in singing observed each morning during development 15 . A larger magnitude of non - monotonic singing behaviour—which is positively correlated with the eventual degree of song copying 15 —would result from stronger or more accurate sensory influences on premotor networks . Because the differences between sensory ( night time ) and motor ( daytime ) network configurations decrease during development ( improved sensorimotor integration ) , the magnitude of the circadian singing patterns would decrease , as is actually observed 15 . The plastic changes that we have described are released by the confluence of two sensory signals : the model and feed - back . We further speculate this could occur at the level of RA itself , which receives inputs from the descending motor pathway and from the cortico - basal ganglia pathway . Spontaneous activity guides early development of the nervous system . Here , high - frequency burst - mode firing , a common feature of vertebrate forebrain neurons , is structured by sleep - mediated learning mechanisms , emerging strikingly late in development as the organism experiences appropriate environmental cues . It remains to be seen whether bursting sleep activity represents the activation of sensory traces in other forms of skill learning , and perhaps more generally . Structured spontaneous discharge is observed broadly in the forebrain during sleep 28 , and has been assoc - iated with recall 29 , 30 . METHODS SUMMARY Birds were bred in - house in sound - isolation boxes , and were female - raised to isolatethemfromadultmalesongbeginningonorbeforepost - hatch - day ( PHD ) 15 . Males ( n 5 21 ) were isolated in individual sound - isolation boxes between PHD30 and PHD35 , and received a preparatory surgery between PHD37 and PHD40 . Songwasrecordedcontinuouslystartingonorbeforethefirstdaypost - surgery until at least PHD90 , and neural recordings began two to three days later . Birds were permitted to self - elicit song playback by pulling a string in the cage after 3 . 3 6 1 . 6 nights of neuronal recordings . Burstingincrease . Wequantifiedtheincreaseinhigh - frequency neuronalactiv - ity as a normalized change in the percentage of the ISI distribution # 40ms , which captures short intervals associated with bursting in these juvenile birds and the difference in bursting before and after song exposure ( Fig . 1a ) . Nightly values were calculated by first taking the mean ISI distribution across cells for a given night for a given bird . The proportion of the mean distribution # 40ms wasfoundandnightlyvalueswerenormalizedwithinbirdsbythemeanfromthefournightsprecedingtutorsongexposureonset ( Fig . 1b ) . Wealsoperformedthe same calculation but first applying a linear transformation of ISIs so that the mean spike rate was the same for all cells before and after tutor song exposure , finding a similar increase in bursting after song exposure ( Fig . 1b , open circles ) . Correlation coefficients . For statistical analysis of Pearson correlation coeffi - cients , Fisher’s r - to - z transformation was performed on the correlation values . Wherethetransformeddataare plotted ( Fig . 2d ) , the r valueshaveasymmetrical standard deviations because the transformation yields values between 2 1 and 1 .

Around PHD38 , subjects received a single surgery , including implantation of a head - restraint pin and dural EEG electrodes , and , for some birds , muting . Neural recordings began two to three days after the surgery , in the same boxes that housed the birds . Birds were wrapped in a cloth and the head was immo - bilized , connectors were attached to EEG electrode leads , and a high - impedance electrode was lowered into the brain above RA . The box was then closed for the duration of the eight - hour night . Birds were illuminated with infrared light , and EEG signals and video were recorded for the duration of the night while single - cellrecordingsinRAwereobtained . Birdsexperiencednormallevelsofrapideye movement ( REM ) and non - REM sleep as that which has been reported in song - birds previously 17 , 31 , and brief periods of wakefulness . RA was identified stereo - taxically and by the readily identifiable activity patterns of RA neurons . After 3 . 3 6 1 . 6 nights in the recording apparatus ( range 1 – 6 nights ) , when sufficient pre - exposure data had been obtained ( 2 . 6 6 1 . 1 nights of successful recordings ; range 1 – 5 nights ) , birds were allowed to self - elicit playback of a song model by pulling a string , until PHD90 . Birds were limited to ten renditions of the tutor song during each morning and afternoon training session . Neuronal recordings were collected over 5 – 16 nights ( except one bird for which we only succeeded in collecting data for nights 2 2 , 2 1 and 1 relative to song exposure ) . Because clearly identifiable repeated syllables do not begin to emerge until several days after tutor song exposure onset 15 , rather than try to cluster song elements in proto - syllables , we examined the entropy variance of all song ele - ments produced to assess daily trends before and after the onset of tutor song exposure . Data collection and analysis used Sound Analysis Pro , Matlab , and in - house software . Surgical muting . For some birds , a muting procedure 32 was performed at the time of the surgery . A small opening was made into the interclavicular air sac . A smallfenestrawasmadeinthetracheajustrostraltothesyrinxandinthebronchiimmediatelycaudaltothesyrinxwithintheinterclavicularairsac . The external opening was sutured closed . This procedure probably eliminates the ability to generate pressure across the syrinx . Birds M1 and M3 were successfully muted but bird M2 continued to vocalize immediately after the surgery ( presumably , thevocaltractholessealed ) . Bothmutedbirdseventuallyrecoveredtheabilityto sing . On days 9 and 11 post - surgery , M1 and M3 began making very sparse , soft vocalizations composed of simple harmonic stacks of various length . Over the following few weeks , birds developed normal plastic song and both eventually achieved a final copy that showed learning in the range of the non - devocalized birds . White noise cancellation . White noise was played continuously , during the subjective day , starting on the day before the first night of neural recordings . To assess whether birds were singing , we used an active noise cancellation tech - nique 33 . Inbrief , probeauditorysignalswereplayedandrecordedtoestimatethe transfer function of the recording chamber . Using the known input to the speaker and the transfer function , the white noise signal broadcast from the speaker was subtracted from the overall signal reaching the microphone , allow - ingustoobservesong ( albeitwithlowfidelity ) . Onthebasisofthistechniquewe observed that birds WN1 , WN2 and WN3 sang frequently while exposed to continuous white noise ( and they also sang immediately after the white noise was turned off ) . Bird WN4 failed to sing in white noise and also only recovered singing four days after white noise exposure was terminated . Song similarity measures . The similarity of a bird’s song to its tutor song was computed as described previously 15 , 19 , 34 using Sound Analysis Pro software . In brief , means and variances of acoustic features , principally duration , pitch , Weiner entropy and mean frequency , were calculated for each syllable produced byeachbird . Similaritybetweena givensongandthetutorsonga birdheardwas computed by a quantitative comparison of this array of acoustic features . 31 . Rattenborg , N . C . et al .
