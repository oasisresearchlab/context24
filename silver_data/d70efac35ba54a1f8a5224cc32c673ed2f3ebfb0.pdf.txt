CYTOSKELETON Vinculin forms a directionally asymmetric catch bond with F - actin Derek L . Huang , 1 * Nicolas A . Bax , 2 * Craig D . Buckley , 3 William I . Weis , 1 , 2 , 4 † Alexander R . Dunn 1 , 3 , 5 † Vinculin is an actin - binding protein thought to reinforce cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesions . However , how mechanical load affects the vinculin – F - actin bond is unclear . Using a single - molecule optical trap assay , we found that vinculin forms a force - dependent catch bond with F - actin through its tail domain , but with lifetimes that depend strongly on the direction of the applied force . Force toward the pointed ( – ) end of the actin filament resulted in a bond that was maximally stable at 8 piconewtons , with a mean lifetime ( 12 seconds ) 10 times as long as the mean lifetime when force was applied toward the barbed ( + ) end . A computational model of lamellipodial actin dynamics suggests that the directionality of the vinculin – F - actin bond could establish long - range order in the actin cytoskeleton . The directional and force - stabilized binding of vinculin to F - actin may be a mechanism by which adhesion complexes maintain front - rear asymmetry in migrating cells . C adherin - and integrin - based protein assem - blies link cells to each other and to the ex - tracellular matrix ( ECM ) , respectively , and together provide the physical basis for the organization of multicellular tissues ( 1 ) . Both classes of adhesion complexes are highly sensitive to mechanical load and change rapidly in size and composition to maintain the physical integrity of living tissues ( 2 ) . These adhesions are also es - sential in defining the physical asymmetries that underlie both individual and collective cell mi - gration in the context of embryonic development ( 3 ) , wound healing ( 4 ) , and cancer metastasis ( 5 ) . However , the molecular basis of how cadherin - and integrin - based adhesions respond to me - chanical stimuli to regulate tissue cohesion and directional cell migration has thus far remained poorly understood . The protein vinculin is a component of both cadherin - and integrin - based adhesion complexes and is rapidly recruited to both types of adhe - sions in response to mechanical load through its interactions with a - catenin and talin , respectively ( 6 – 8 ) . Vinculin plays a key role in maintaining tis - sue integrity ( 9 , 10 ) ; for example , loss of vinculin in mice results in the death of the developing em - bryo owing to defects in neural tube closure and heart development ( 11 ) . Importantly , vinculin is required for persistent directional cell migration , suggestive of a role in generating a polarized connection between adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton ( 12 , 13 ) . Although vinculin is also re - cruited to cadherin - based adhesions in a force - dependent manner ( 6 , 14 ) , comparatively little is known about how it might regulate actin or - ganization and dynamics at those sites . Vinculin binds directly to filamentous actin ( F - actin ) through its actin - binding tail domain ( Vt ) ( 15 , 16 ) , but how and whether this bond may be regulated by mechanical load is not known . Defining this mechanism is critical to understand - ing the role of vinculin as a reinforcing link between adhesion complexes and the actin cy - toskeleton . We modified a previously developed optical trap ( OT ) – based assay ( 17 ) to define the load dependence of the binding interaction be - tween vinculin and F - actin ( Fig . 1A ) . Actin bind - ing to full - length , wild - type vinculin is blocked by autoinhibitory intramolecular interactions between the N - terminal head domain and Vt ( 15 ) . We thus used a well - characterized vinculin con - struct , termed T12 vinculin , bearing mutations that disrupt the autoinhibitory head - Vt interac - tion ( 18 ) . In the OT assay , the displacement of the microsphere ( 1 m m in diameter ) from the trap center typically decreased in several distinct steps ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) , indicative of the sequential re - lease of multiple vinculin molecules from the actin filament ( 17 ) . The last stair step in this se - ries likely reflects a state in which actin is bound by a single vinculin molecule ( 19 ) , allowing us to determine the effect of mechanical load on the kinetics of vinculin unbinding . The duration of vinculin - actin binding events depended on the level of mechanical load : Events were short ( < 1 s ) at low loads ( 0 to 3 pN ) , markedly longer ( ~ 10 s ) at intermediate loads ( 7 to 10 pN ) , and again short ( < 1 s ) at loads > 15 pN ( Fig . 1C ) .

Owing to the nature of the loaded OT assay , few binding events were observed at loads less than 2 pN , where catch and slip bond models differ greatly in their pre - dicted lifetimes . To measure lifetimes in this force range , we developed an alternative assay in which an actin filament was positioned near a platform oscillating at 200 Hz over 5 nm . Binding of vinculin to the actin filament was detected by a decrease in the amplitude of microsphere fluc - tuations ( fig . S1 ) . This alternative assay could not resolve sequential unbinding steps , which means that the mean binding lifetimes measured in this way may be overestimated . Nonetheless , the binding events observed near zero force were markedly shorter than those measured at loads higher than 2 pN [ P < 0 . 01 in a one - tailed two - sample Kolmogorov - Smirnov ( KS ) test ] , consistent with the idea that mechan - ical load increases the lifetime of the vinculin - actin bond . A vinculin binding event can displace a trapped actin filament in one of two directions , depending on which direction the platform is moving when binding occurs ( Fig . 1B ) . We noted that mechan - ical load applied in one direction resulted in longer mean bond lifetimes than when load was applied in the opposite direction . This result is unlikely to have been caused by a systematic error in the OT assay , because the direction yielding longer lifetimes switched when we physically rotated the filament by 180° . F - actin is polar , with a barbed ( + ) and pointed ( – ) end , so we tested whether the observed direc - tionality could arise from the asymmetric bind - ing interface between vinculin and the actin filament . To determine the polarity of a trapped actin filament , we used platforms that were Huang et al . , Science 357 , 703 – 706 ( 2017 ) 18 August 2017 2 of 4 Fig . 2 .

( B ) In our computational model , actin filaments ( orange ) undergo 2D Brownian diffusion with a drift velocity .

RESEARCH | REPORT coated with myosin VI ( fig . S2 ) . Myosin VI moves in a processive manner toward the pointed ( – ) end of the actin filament ( 22 ) , so the displace - ment of one of the microspheres from its OT allowed us to assign the polarity of the trapped actin filament ( fig . S3 ) . The same filament , now with known polarity , was moved to a vinculin - coated platform and tested as before . Over the range of loads tested ( 1 to 30 pN ) , the vinculin – actin filament bond exhibited a mean lifetime that was ~ 10 times as long when the force ex - perienced by vinculin was directed toward the pointed ( – ) as opposed to the barbed ( + ) end of the actin filament ( Fig . 1C and fig . S3 ) . To explain the observed distribution of bond lifetimes , we tested several kinetic models that have been used to describe how bond lifetimes depend on mechanical load ( 19 ) . Catch bond models that feature a single bound state ( 23 ) predict a single exponential distribution of lifetimes at any given force and thus do not accurately describe the mixture of short - and long - lived events that we observed ( fig . S4 ) . We therefore chose a two - bound - state model ( 24 , 25 ) in which the bond can transition between unbound ( 0 ) , weakly bound ( 1 ) , and strongly bound ( 2 ) states with load - dependent rates ( Fig . 2A , inset ) given by a modified Bell model k ij ð F Þ ¼ k 0 ij e j F j x ij = k B T where the transition rate k ij ( F ) between two states depends on x ij , which reflects both the physical distance between the initial state i and the peak of the energy barrier ( the transition state ) be - tween states i and j , as well as the extent to which the applied force F is aligned with this direction ( k B , Boltzmann constant ; T , temperature ) ( fig . S5A ) . Using maximum likelihood estimation , we found that this two - bound - state model best fit the data for displacements in both the pointed ( – ) and barbed ( + ) end directions ( Fig . 2 ) . To obtain accurate parameter estimates , we aug - mented the force - lifetime data set in which actin filament polarity was explicitly determined ( Fig . 1 and fig . S3B ) with a data set in which the actin polarity was inferred from a statistical test ( fig . S3 , C and D , and supplemental text ) . In the model fit , vinculin bound in the weak - binding state 90 % of the time and equilibrated with the strong - bindingstate . Importantly , mechanicalloadlowered the rate at which the strong - binding state transi - tioned back to the weak - binding state , thereby stabilizing the vinculin – actin filament bond ( fig . S6 ) . The direction of applied force determined the extent to which it stabilized the strongly bound state , whichisencodedinthedistance parameters x ij ( Table 1 ) . Thus , the two - bound - state catch bond model provides a kinetic basis for the direc - tionality of vinculin – actin filament binding . We next examined which domain ( s ) of vinculin were required for the formation of a directional catch bond to F - actin . We tested a protein con - struct containing only the Vt ( residues 879 to 1066 ) , which binds to F - actin . Similarly to the case of T12 vinculin , the Vt bond to F - actin was stabilized by mechanical load in either direction , and load directed toward the pointed ( – ) end resulted in higher stability ( fig . S3 , B and D ) . Thus , Vt alone is sufficient to form a directional catch bond with the actin filament ( Fig . 2B ) . The less pronounced directionality in Vt binding was reflected in differences in the distance parameter x 21 for the strong - to - weak transition ( Table 1 ) . This parameter is sensitive to the angle of ap - plied load , and the presence of the vinculin head might change the direction of force experienced by the Vt ( fig . S5 ) . Alternatively , the vinculin head may contain cryptic actin - binding site ( s ) that are revealed upon application of load . In any case , formation of a directionally asymmetric catch bond appears to be intrinsic to the interaction of the Vt with the actin filament . In migrating cells , actin filaments near the leading edge are almost all oriented with their barbed ( + ) ends facing the membrane , whereas filament orientation becomes increasingly iso - tropic toward the cell center ( 26 – 29 ) . We used computational modeling to investigate whether the directional interaction between vinculin and actin could potentially generate long - range order in the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 3A ) . In our model , actin filaments underwent two - dimensional ( 2D ) Brownian diffusion with a drift velocity that represented retrograde actin flow in a migrat - ing cell ( Fig . 3B ) . Vinculin binding was modeled as the attachment of a simple spring that resisted retrograde actin filament motion . The unbinding kinetics of the vinculin - actin bond were those obtained from the two - bound - state model of the OT data and thus captured both direction - ality and load - induced stabilization . An ensem - ble of randomly oriented actin filaments was subjected to a drift velocity , thermal fluctuations , and stochastic vinculin binding ( Fig . 3C ) . As the simulation progressed , these conditions resulted in the development of orientational asymmetry , with the majority of filaments closer to the starting position ( x = 0 m m ) oriented with their barbed ( + ) ends facing the leading edge ( Fig . 3D ) . Thus , directional asymmetry of the vinculin - actin bond can potentially establish a spatial asymmetry in F - actin polarity ( fig . S7 ) , an effect that may underlie the prior observation that vinculin is essential for generating persistent , directional cell migration ( 12 , 13 , 30 ) . The directionally asymmetric link - age of vinculin to actin may complement other mechanisms by which cells generate persistent migration , such as the signaling cascade that activates the barbed ( + ) end nucleators Arp2 / 3 ( 31 ) and formins ( 32 ) , which reinforce cell po - larity by promoting actin polymerization at the cell ’ s leading edge . We have shown that vinculin forms a direc - tionally asymmetric and force - stabilized linkage to F - actin . Directional asymmetry of this sort is not unknown ; the binding of kinesin with micro - tubules is destabilized by load , characteristic of a slip bond , but to a different extent depending on loading direction ( 33 ) , and the binding of the myosin V head with actin , and dynein with mi - crotubules , is asymmetrically stabilized by load , which may promote motor processivity ( 34 , 35 ) . The directional interaction between vinculin and actin may play a critical role in tissue patterning . Consistent with this idea , vinculin - null mouse embryos exhibit phenotypes suggestive of fail - ures not only in cell adhesion , but also in tissue patterning driven by cell migration , notably axon Huang et al . , Science 357 , 703 – 706 ( 2017 ) 18 August 2017 3 of 4 Table 1 .

RESEARCH | REPORT outgrowth ( 11 ) . Vinculin - deficient cells likewise exhibit defects in the formation of stable lamelli - podia and filopodia ( 36 ) and are more motile ( 37 ) but less directionally persistent ( 13 , 30 ) . Thus , vinculin does not appear to be required for ad - hesion or motility per se , but instead for stable protrusion and polarized migration . The observa - tion that vinculin forms a catch bond with actin in both directions of applied load ( Fig . 2 ) likely reflects its biological function as a reinforcing linker at adhesions , including those in which actin may not be polarized . A comparison be - tween actin binding by vinculin ( Fig . 2A ) and the E - cadherin / b - catenin / a E - catenin ( cadherin - catenin ) complex ( 17 ) — which vinculin is believed to mechanically reinforce — suggests that under barbed ( + ) end – directed load , vinculin binds with stability comparable to that of the cadherin - catenin complex , but that under pointed ( – ) end – directed load , vinculin stability is ~ 10 times as high . Within the limits of our assay , the binding of the cadherin - catenin complex to actin did not exhibit a directional response to force . We sug - gest that the asymmetric catch bond behavior of vinculin , in addition to enhancing overall re - sistance to mechanical load , could contribute to organizing the polarity of the actin cytoskeleton in response to internally and externally applied loads at cell - cell contacts .
