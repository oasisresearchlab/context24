SARS - CoV - 2 was detectable at all PCIS stages by PCR and was cultured from the section of the sampler collecting particles in the 0 . 25 to 0 . 50 (cid:0)μ m size range . .

There are now multiple epidemiology studies consistent with aerosol spread of SARS - CoV - 2 within closed spaces , 2 , 3 and the virus has been shown to remain infective in laboratory - generated aerosols for at least 16 hours . 4 Data from our group and others have documented the presence of the virus in aerosols in patient settings by RT - PCR . 5 - 7 However , molecular detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA does not necessarily correlate with risk of developing COVID - 19 , since only viable virions can cause disease . Subsequently , we have reported isolation of viable SARS - CoV - 2 from the air within the room of hospitalized COVID - 19 patients . 8 The current study was undertaken to assess SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in a “real life” setting , outside of a medical facility . In epidemiologic studies , public transportation vehicles have been identified as a risk factor for transmission by CDC , and studies from Singapore have reported an odds ratio for infection of 3 . 07 [ 95 % CI 1 . 55 - 6 . 08 ] for persons sharing a vehicle with an infected person . 9 In this setting , we were interested in documenting that viable virus could be isolated from the air of a car being driven by a person infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . We were also interested in determining the size distribution of airborne respiratory secretions that contain virions to provide some guide to the contribution of droplets and aerosols to transmission risk . To do this , we asked a COVID patient with minimal symptoms to drive her car for a short period of time with a Sioutas personal cascade impactor sampler ( PCIS ) 10 clipped onto the sun - visor above the passenger seat next to her . The Sioutas PCIS separates airborne particles in a cascading fashion and simultaneously collects the size - fractionated particles by impaction on polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) filters . It has collection filters on four impaction stages ( A – D ) , .

The PCIS separates and collects airborne particulate matter above the cut - point of five size ranges : > 2 . 5 (cid:0)μ m ( Stage A ) , 1 . 0 to 2 . 5 (cid:0)μ m ( Stage B ) , 0 . 50 to 1 . 0 (cid:0)μ m ( Stage C ) , 0 . 25 to 0 . 50 (cid:0)μ m ( Stage D ) , and < 0 . 25 (cid:0)μ m ( collected on an after - filter ) ( Figure 1 ) ; details of the instrumentation and laboratory methods are included in supplementary material . For the current study , a PCIS ( SKC , Inc . , catalog number 225 - 370 ) unit was used with a Leland Legacy pump ( SKC , Inc . , cat number 100 - 3002 ) and operated at a flow rate of 9 (cid:0) L / min . The patient , who was in her twenties , had initially presented to clinic with a one - day history of mild fatigue , nasal congestion , and sore throat , following exposure to a roommate who had a laboratory - confirmed diagnosis of COVID - 19 . The patient denied fever , cough , shortness of breath , or other symptoms , and had a normal physical exam . In testing performed by the UFHealth clinical laboratory , a nasopharyngeal swab collected at the time of presentation was positive by RT - PCR . The patient was advised to isolate at home for a 10 - day period of time , and appropriate contact tracing was initiated . Two days after the diagnostic sample was obtained , the patient agreed to have the PCIS placed on the passenger seat of her car ( an older model Honda Accord ) for the drive from the clinic to her home . Her symptoms at that time were minimal , with no cough . The PCIS was attached to the sun - visor on the passenger side of the car , approximately 3 feet from the patient’s face and with the intake port pointing toward the roof of the car . During the 15 - minute drive the patient was not wearing a mask . The air conditioner in the car was on : during the drive the temperature within the car’s cabin ranged from 24 . 2 to 22 . 8 °C and relative humidity fluctuated from 55 . 2 to 42 . 5 % ; outside temperature was 32 °C and relative humidity 99 % . Two hours after the patient’s arrival home , an investigator wearing personal protective equipment ( N95 mask , gloves , and a Tyvek laboratory coat ) opened the car and turned off the .

After removal from the car , the air sampling assembly was transported with appropriate biosafety precautions to a BSL2 - enhanced laboratory at the University of Florida . Within 30 minutes of the termination of air - sampling , the PCIS filters were individually immersed in 1 ml of recovery solution ( PBS with 0 . 5 % (cid:0) w / v BSA fraction V and 0 . 2 M surcose 11 ) for 30 minutes at room temperature , and then scraped with flocked swabs pre - wetted with recovery solution . Samples were concentrated by centrifugation and stored at - 80°C . After one thaw on ice , RNA was extracted from 140 µl of material extruded off the PCIS filters using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit . rRT - PCR to detect SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was performed using primer system Led - N - F , Led - N - R , and Led - N - probe . 11 The number of viral genome equivalents present in each sample was estimated from the measured quantification cycle ( Cq ) values , and was attained using 10 - fold dilutions of calibrated plasmids containing an insert of the SARS - CoV - 2 N - gene as previously described . 8 SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected on filters A to D , suggesting that the PCIS had collected a range of particle sizes containing SARS - CoV - 2 virions or other material ( possibly cell debris ) containing SARS - CoV - 2 RNA ( Table 1 ) . More of the SARS - CoV - 2 RNA material was collected on filter D than that on filters A – C and E combined . Filter material was subsequently inoculated onto Vero E6 cells as previously described . 8 Early cytopathic effects consistent with those caused by SARS - CoV - 2 were observable by 3 days in cells inoculated with material collected onto PCIS filter D ; by day 5 , foci of infection were apparent for cells inoculated with material from filter D ( Supplemental Figure 1C and D ) , with no signs of virus infection in cells inoculated with material collected by PCIS filters B , C , and E . The mock - infected cell monolayer remained intact ( Supplemental Figure 1A ) , fungus overgrowth was evident in cells inoculated with material from PCIS filter A ( Supplemental Figure 1B ) , and .

For further confirmation , an aliquot ( 20 µl ) of the virus collected 5 days post inoculation of material from filter D was passaged in Vero E6 cells , wherein an rRT - PCR Cq value of 12 . 46 was attained 3 days post - inoculation of the cells . Sanger sequencing was performed on RNA extracted from the cell growth medium corresponding to PCID filter D ; as a secondary check , NGS was also performed using an Illumina MiSeq platform . 8 Sequencing reactions were performed at different locations by different personnel . The virus isolated was designated as SARS - CoV - 2 / human / USA / UF - 29 / 2020 ( GenBank no . MW229264 . 1 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 UF - 29 has the following marker variants relative to reference strain Wuhan - Hu - 1 ( GenBank no . NC _ 045512 . 2 ) : C241T , C3037T , A23403G , G25563T , Spike protein D614G , and ORF3a protein Q57H . These markers identify it as a member of clade GH following Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data ( GISAID ) clade nomenclature . The air we breathe typically contains airborne particles of biological origin , including bacteria ( cells and spores ) , fungi ( mycelia and spores ) , and virions . Respiratory pathogens that are able to remain viable after aerosolization and air transport are potential causes of respiratory diseases , and they are often associated with other substances to form ‘complex particles . ’ 11 - 12 It should be noted that scanning electron microscopy of human specimens that contain SARS - CoV - 2 often depict clumps of virions and virions attached in a beads on a string manner ( example : see https : / / www . flickr . com / photos / 54591706 @ N02 / 49557785797 ) . Therefore , it is plausible that humans release different forms of the virus ( clumped , single particle , etc . ) , which affects how the virions are partitioned in different - sized airborne respiratory secretions . Our detection of vRNA in stages A to D of the impactor is consistent with the hypothesis that virions are present in different sized respiratory secretions . Remarkably , viable virus was only detected in stage D , corresponding to collection of airborne particles of the size range of 0 . 25 to 0 . 5 µm . .

The air flow in the impactor increases in velocity as it passes through stages A to E , imperiling virions collected at stage D to a greater extent than virions collected at earlier stages . Yet despite these potential adverse conditions , we isolated viable virus from stage D of the impactor . Taken together , our data highlight the potential risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission by minimally symptomatic persons in the closed space inside of a car ( with closed windows and air conditioning running ) , and suggest that a substantial component of that risk is via aerosolized virus . .

The PCIS separates and collects airborne particulate matter above the cut - point of five size ranges : > 2 . 5 (cid:0)μ m ( Stage A ) , 1 . 0 to 2 . 5 (cid:0)μ m ( Stage B ) , 0 . 50 to 1 . 0 (cid:0)μ m ( Stage C ) , 0 . 25 to 0 . 50 (cid:0)μ m ( Stage D ) , and < 0 . 25 (cid:0)μ m ( collected on an after - filter ) ( Figure 1 ) . PTFE filters ( Teflon filters ) can collect particles at high efficiency above the cut - points without the need for coatings , 1 and that is advantageous , as various coatings reduce the recovery efficiency of viable virus . For the collection of airborne viruses , the filters are not prewetted with methanol prior to use , which helps preserve virus viability . 3 For the current study , a PCIS ( SKC , Inc . , catalog number 225 - 370 ) unit was used with a Leland Legacy pump ( SKC , Inc . , cat number 100 - 3002 ) and operated at a flow rate of 9 (cid:0) L / min . PTFE filters ( 25 (cid:0) mm , 0 . 5 (cid:0)μ m pore , SKC , Inc . catalog number 225 - 2708 ) were used for the collection stages A to D , and a PTFE after - filter ( 37 (cid:0) mm , 2 . 0 (cid:0)μ m pore , SKC Inc . , catalog number 225 - 1709 ) for stage E . The pump ' s operating flow rate ( 9 L / min ) was calibrated by measuring volume displacement using a Defender Primary Standard Calibrator ( SKC , Inc . , catalog number 717 - 510H ) . The patient drove the car for 15 minutes with windows closed and the air - conditioner on , then parked it and exited , leaving the windows up and the air sampler running for an additional 120 minutes . A total collection time of 135 (cid:0) min was thus used to sample approximately 1 . 22 (cid:0) m 3 of air within the vehicle . .

The filters and fluid were then transferred to a sterile plastic petri dish , and the filters scraped with flocked swabs pre - wetted with recovery solution and residual fluid in each swab extruded into the liquid corresponding to each filter . The recovery solutions were concentrated by centrifugation in Amicon Ultra - 15 centrifugal filter units with Ultracel - 100 membranes with a molecular mass cutoff of 100 kDa ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) at 4 , 000 × g for 12 min to a volume of approximately < 400 μ L , and the concentrates adjusted to 400 µL by addition of recovery solution . They were then aseptically transferred to sterile plastic cryotubes with O - ring seals , and the tubes stored in a locked - 80°C freezer for subsequent analyses . After one thaw on ice , RNA was extracted from 140 µl of material extruded off the PCIS filters using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and the purified bound RNA eluted from the RNA - binding silicon columns in a volume of 80 µl . rRT - PCR was subsequently used to detect SARS - CoV - 2 RNA and was performed using primer system Led - N - F , Led - N - R , and Led - N - probe . 4 Briefly , vRNA was denatured for 5 (cid:0) min at 67°C in the presence of SUPERase - In RNase inhibitor ( Invitrogen Corp . ) , cooled rapidly , and 25 µl rtRT - PCR performed in a BioRad CFX96 Touch Real - Time PCR Detection System using 5 μ L of purified vRNA using the following parameters : 400 nM final concentration of forward and reverse primers and 100 nM final concentration of probe using SuperScript TM III One - Step RT - PCR system with Platinum TM Taq DNA Polymerase ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Cycling conditions were 20 minute at 50 °C for reverse transcription step , followed by 2 minutes at 95 °C for Taq polymerase activation step , then 44 cycles of 15 seconds at 95 °C of denaturing , 30 seconds at 57 °C for annealing , and 20 seconds at 68 °C for extension . 5 The number of viral genome equivalents present in each sample was estimated .
