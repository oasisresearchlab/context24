Internalization and degradation of EGFR after ligand binding limits the intensity of proliferative signaling , thereby helping to maintain cell integrity . In cancer cells , deregulation of EGFR traf ﬁ cking has a variety of effects on tumor progression . Here we report that sortilin is a key regulator of EGFR internalization . Loss of sortilin in tumor cells promoted cell proliferation by sustaining EGFR signaling at the cell surface , ultimately accelerating tumor growth . In lung cancer patients , sortilin expression decreased with increased pathologic grade , and expression of sortilin was strongly correlated with survival , especially in patients with high EGFR expression . Sortilin is therefore a regulator of EGFR intracellular traf ﬁ cking that promotes receptor internalization and limits signaling , which in turn impacts tumor growth .

TKRs relay the extracellular cues into the cell , leading to regulation of intracellular processes related to cell proliferation , migration , and survival 2 . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is the archetypal TKR 3 , 4 . EGFR signaling is triggered by binding of its growth factor ligands , such as epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , leading to the autopho - sphorylation of tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic tail and thereby inducing cell signaling . Subsequently , EGFR is internalized 5 , and both the endocytic route and the fate of EGFR are regulated by adaptor proteins that dock with the tyrosine kinase domain 6 . The rapid internalization and degradation of the EGFR are under tight spatiotemporal control to limit cell proliferation promoted by mitogen activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) 7 – 9 . This negative feedback mechanism , governed by ligand - induced lysosomal degradation of EGFR , ensures signal termination and counteracts the oncogenic and transforming role of EGFR 10 – 12 . Accordingly , high - EGFR expression is a common feature of multiple cancers . Furthermore , inactivation of sorting proteins , which regulate both the duration and the intensity of EGFR signaling , plays a causal role in EGFR - induced promotion of tumor growth by sustaining proliferative signaling , a hallmark of cancer 13 – 18 . Because multiple facets of EGFR traf ﬁ cking remain unre - solved 19 , and EGFR internalization represents a crucial step for signal termination , we investigated the role of sortilin 20 – 22 in EGFR regulation following EGF - induced EGFR internalization . Sortilin , a member of the vacuolar protein sorting 10 ( VPS10 ) protein family of sorting receptors 23 , shuttles between the plasma membrane and the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) 21 , 22 , 24 . The VPS10 domain constitutes the entire luminal domain of sortilin 25 , which is considered to be a multifaceted sorting receptor involved in neurotrophin TKR traf ﬁ cking in neurons 26 . In a previous report , we showed that sortilin also facilitates both the transport and loading of EGFR into extracellular vesicles containing exosome speci ﬁ c markers 27 . Because EGFR is not present in exosomes derived from sortilin - depleted cells , we focused on the function of sortilin in EGFR intracellular traf ﬁ cking . Our results reveal that sortilin regulates EGFR by controlling its internalization from the plasma membrane , thereby limiting proliferative signaling , an essential driving force behind tumor aggressiveness . Moreover , we found that low expression of sortilin is associated with more aggressive lung adenocarcinoma tumors . Hence , sortilin expression represents a favorable prognostic marker in lung adenocarcinoma patients . Results EGF stimulation promotes EGFR and sortilin interaction . Sortilin has been implicated in several protein sorting pathways between the plasma membrane , endosomes , and the TGN 28 . Based on ﬁ ndings from an earlier report in which we observed that sortilin participates in loading of EGFR into exosomes 27 , and because exosome synthesis depends on endosome traf ﬁ cking 29 , we speculated that sortilin is involved in sorting a pool of EGFR that increases upon ligand - induced EGFR internalization . To achieve complete EGFR endocytosis and avoid endosome arrest and EGFR recycling via EGFR - inhibited autophagy 30 , we stimulated A549 human non - small cell lung carcinoma cells with EGF under normal serum conditions , analyzed the canonical EGF - induced pathways of active EGFR in whole - cell lysate ( WCL ) , and investigated whether EGF stimulation promoted the interaction between EGFR and sortilin . As expected , EGFR activation induced MAP kinase signaling , as evidenced by elevated ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation downstream of EGFR activa - tion ( Fig . 1a , WCL panel ) . Furthermore , EGF stimulation promoted EGFR internalization , as re ﬂ ected by the reduction in EGFR levels following lysosomal degradation 31 . Consistent with the initial hypothesis , immunoprecipitation ( IP ) performed on the same lysates con ﬁ rmed that EGFR co - immunoprecipitated with sortilin under basal conditions , and that this interaction was strengthened following EGF stimulation ( Fig . 1a , IP panel ) . In addition , we used a proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) to con ﬁ rm the EGFR — sortilin interaction over a time course ( Fig . 1b , insets 1 – 1 to 5 – 2 ) . In the images , the red spots indicate sites of proximity ligation ampli ﬁ cation , re ﬂ ecting the interaction between EGFR and sortilin , which was signi ﬁ cantly strengthened after just 2 min of EGF stimulation ( Fig . 1c ) , suggesting that the EGFR — sortilin interaction occurs in the early stage of EGFR internalization . These results were further con ﬁ rmed by ﬂ uorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) assay ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , b ) . To determine where EGFR and sortilin interact , we ﬁ rst investigated the co - localization of EGFR and sortilin co - localization with various organelle markers , including the early endosome ( EE ) marker Rab5 ( Ras - related protein Rab5 ) , the late endosome / lysosome marker LAMP2 ( Lysosome - associated membrane glycoprotein 2 ) , and the TGN marker TGN46 , in the presence or absence of EGF ( Fig . 1d ) . Under basal conditions , EGFR is mainly localized at the cell membrane ( Fig . 1d , insets 1 – 3 ) . As expected , upon EGF stimulation , internalized EGFR overlapped primarily with the Rab5 and LAMP2 markers ( Fig . 1d , insets 7 , 8 ) , indicating that the majority of active EGFR resided in the endosomal and lysosomal degradation pathways , consistent with the initial results ( Fig . 1a ) . We also observed weak co - localization of EGFR with TGN46 ( Fig . 1d , inset 9 ) consistent with its translocation through the Golgi 16 . However , to determine the subcellular localization of sortilin , we transfected A549 cells with a sortilin - GFP fusion protein , thereby avoiding cross - reactivity with the secondary antibody ( Fig . 1d , insets 4 – 6 and 10 – 12 ) . Under basal conditions , sortilin - GFP overlapped primarily with TGN46 and Rab5 , in agreement with published reports that less than 10 % of the total sortilin pool is expressed at the plasma membrane before being recycled back to the TGN through endosomes 22 , 24 , 32 . Upon EGF stimulation , sortilin - GFP overlapped continuously with TGN46 , and sortilin - GFP signi ﬁ cantly co - localized with Rab5 - positive compartments ( Fig . 1d , insets 10 , 12 ) rather than with the lysosomal marker LAMP2 ( Fig . 1d , inset 11 ) . To rule out the possibility that EGF stimulation induces EGFR and sortilin interaction in the TGN after post - translational modi ﬁ cations , we used the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( CHX ) . PLA performed on EGF - stimulated cells in the presence of CHX revealed no signal variation ( Supplementary Fig . 1c – e ) . These results were also supported by the absence of variation in mRNA and protein levels of either EGFR or sortilin after EGF stimulation ( Supplementary Fig . 1f ) . Hence , we excluded the possibility of an interaction between EGFR and sortilin in the TGN , where the majority of the sortilin resides . These observa - tions were also supported by co - localization analysis based on Mander ’ s overlap coef ﬁ cients ( Fig . 1e ) and the co - localization of EGFR , Rab5 , and sortilin in sortilin - GFP - transfected cells following EGF stimulation ( Fig . 1f , insets 1 – 1 and 1 – 2 ) . Post - nuclear supernatants from A549 cells stimulated or not with EGF were separated onto a 0 – 30 % Iodixanol gradient and subjected to ultracentrifugation ( Supplementary Fig . 1g ) . In the absence of EGF stimulation , intracellular EGFR was distributed diffusely between the EE and the TGN enriched fractions , corresponding to EGFR turnover , whereas sortilin was mainly in the TGN fraction . Interestingly , upon EGF stimulation , EGFR and sortilin ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 01172 - 5 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 1182 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 01172 - 5 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications a IP : IB EGF + – + WCL IgG EGFR EGFR IgG P - EGFR ERK1 / 2 Actin Sortilin P - ERK1 / 2 Sortilin b PLA EGFR / sortilin + Nucleus ( DAPI ) 5 – 1 5 – 1 5 – 2 5 – 2 30 min Inset Inset 1 – 1 1 – 2 1 – 1 1 – 2 – EGF 2 – 1 2 – 2 Inset Inset Inset 3 – 1 3 – 2 4 – 2 4 – 1 2 min 5 min 15 min 2 – 2 4 – 2 3 – 2 4 – 1 3 – 1 2 – 1 + EGF Control c f EGFR Merge Sortilin - GFP Rab5 1 – 1 1 – 2 1 – 1 1 – 2 + EGF 0 1 2 5 15 30 0 20 40 60 80 100 Time ( min ) P L A ( D o t s / c e ll ) * * * * * * * * * * 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 M and e r ' s c oe ff i c i en t Rab5 TGN46 Lamp2 – EGF + EGF EGFR sortilin Rab5 Lamp2 TGN46 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * d e I n s e t M e r ge + N u c l eu s I n s e t M e r ge + N u c l eu s I n s e t – EGF – EGF 3 Fig . 1 EGF promotes the EGFR — sortilin interaction . a A549 cells grown in complete cell culture media were stimulated or not with EGF ( 50 ng / mL ) for 30 min .

Together , these results suggest that EGF strongly induces the EGFR — sortilin interaction following EGFR activation and internalization , and that sortilin interacts with EGFR during the early stage of EGFR internalization . EGFR interacts with sortilin at the plasma membrane . To determine whether the early stage of EGFR endocytosis promotes the EGFR — sortilin interaction , we inhibited endocy - tosis using Dynasore , a cell - permeable dynamin inhibitor 33 . Indeed , inhibition of dynamin prevents clathrin - mediated EGFR endocytosis 34 and endosome maturation in the early stage of endocytosis 35 . Thus , Dynasore inhibits both endosome maturation and endocytosis of newly formed endosomes . In non - stimulated or Dynasore - pretreated cells , EGFR was mainly localized at the cell surface ( Fig . 2a , insets 1 – 1 , 1 – 2 , 3 – 1 , and 3 – 2 ) . EGF stimulation elicited co - localization between EGFR and the early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) ( Fig . 2a , insets 2 – 1 and 2 – 2 ) , whereas dynamin inhibition impaired EGF - induced EGFR endocytosis , as con ﬁ rmed by the presence of EGFR clusters at the cell surface and a reduction in the overlap between the EGFR and EEA1 signals ( Fig . 2a ; insets 4 – 1 , 4 – 2 , and 4 – 3 ( bright - ﬁ eld ) ) . As expected , following plasma membrane retention of the EGFR upon Dynasore treatment , EGF - stimulated cells exhibited both sustained EGFR phosphorylation and reduced EGFR degradation ( Fig . 2b ) . Furthermore , Dynasore alone did not induce EGFR phosphorylation ( Fig . 2b ) . In A549 cells , we observed an overlap between EGFR and sortilin that co - localized poorly with EEA1 ( EEA1 - GFP ) , as revealed by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 2c , insets 1 – 1 and 1 – 2 ) and the co - localization pro ﬁ le ( Fig . 2d ) .

Therefore , we next performed PLA assays to investigate whether the EGFR — sortilin interactions were maintained by Dynasore treatment . Interestingly , Dynasore alone induced a robust EGFR — sortilin interaction that is signi ﬁ cantly stronger than the basal interaction in control cells or that induced by a pulse of EGF ( Fig . 2e , insets 1 – 1 to 3 – 2 and Fig . 2f ) . Furthermore , this interaction was still independent of EGFR activation , as observed in the results described above , and EGFR was not phosphorylated in the presence of Dynasore alone ( Fig . 2b ) . Surprisingly , addition of EGF to Dynasore – pretreated cells did not alter the EGFR — sortilin interaction in comparison to that in cells treated with Dynasore alone ( Fig . 2e , insets 4 – 1 to 4 – 4 and Fig . 2f ) .

These results suggest that sortilin participates in the internalization of unliganded EGFR , which is 10 - fold slower than that of EGF - stimulated receptor 36 . Together , these results indicate that in A549 cells , the EGFR — sortilin complex takes place at the plasma membrane . However , Dynasore could alter endosome maturation , TGN or other traf ﬁ cking intermediates driving to accumulated structures close to the plasma membrane . Hence , to better delineate the location of EGFR — sortilin , we used a version of sortilin that cannot be endocytosed , leading to accumulation of sortilin at the cell surface . Cell surface - enriched sortilin strongly interacts with EGFR . To investigate the mechanism underlying the EGFR — sortilin inter - action , we used the non - tumor cell line HEK293 , which expresses low levels of both endogenous EGFR and sortilin 37 , 38 . Because sortilin cycles from the plasma membrane to the TGN , and in light of our previous observation that Dynasore alone unveiled the EGFR — sortilin interaction , we overexpressed a sortilin mutant lacking the intracellular C - terminal domain ( Δ c - sortilin ) but containing the extracellular VPS10 sorting domain 23 . Because the C - terminal domain of sortilin controls its internalization , Δ c - sortilin cannot be recycled from the plasma membrane 24 , 39 . We transfected HEK293 cells with either full - length ( FL ) or truncated ( Δ c ) GFP - tagged sortilin , and then monitored co - localization of both proteins with TGN46 . As expected , FL - sortilin was largely localized to the perinuclear region , along with TGN46 , whereas Δ c - sortilin exhibited plasma membrane retention , as indicated by Mander ’ s overlap coef ﬁ cient ( Fig . 3a , insets 1 – 1 to 2 – 2 , Fig . 3b , c ) . Next , we overexpressed both EGFR and sortilin to evaluate the interactions between EGFR and FL - or Δ c - sortilin . Interestingly , EGFR immunostaining overlapped with GFP - tagged Δ c - sortilin signal at the cell surface ( Fig . 3d , insets 1 – 1 to 2 – 2 ) . Next , we transiently transfected cells with EGFR and FL - or a Δ c - v5 tagged sortilin . Without EGF stimulation , IP revealed a stronger interaction between EGFR and the Δ c - sortilin that accumulated at the cell surface ( Fig . 3e ) . We then generated HEK293 stable cell lines that overexpressed both GFP - tagged EGFR and untagged FL - or Δ c - sortilin . In both stable cell lines , the canonical pathway of EGF - induced EGFR activity was unaltered , as attested by the proper phosphorylation of MAPK ERK1 / 2 ( Fig . 3f , WCL panel ) . Interestingly , IP con ﬁ rmed the EGFR / Δ c - sortilin interaction , with an increase in the EGFR / FL - sortilin interaction occurring exclusively after EGF stimulation ( Fig . 3f , IB panel ) , as previously observed in A549 cells . Taken together , these data demonstrate that the EGFR — sortilin interaction occurs at the cell surface , and is strengthened when sortilin is enriched at the cell membrane regardless of EGF stimulation . Sortilin and EGFR interact by their extracellular domains . To further delineate the domain of interaction between EGFR and sortilin , we transiently co - transfected Δ c - sortilin with either the extracellular ( ECD ) or intracellular domain ( ICD ) of EGFR in HEK293 cells . Interestingly , EGFR - ECD mostly immunoprecipi - tated with sortilin ( Fig . 3g ) , indicating that this interaction involves the ECD of EGFR , and the sortilin VPS10 sorting domain , which constitutes the entire ECD of sortilin , is impli - cated in several intracellular sorting processes 22 , 23 , 40 . These results suggest that point mutations or deletion of the EGFR intracellular tyrosine kinase domain , frequently reported in lung adenocarcinoma , cannot prevent the EGFR — sortilin interaction . Indeed , mutant EGFR proteins are strongly tyrosine - phosphorylated even in the absence of ligand 41 . Consistent with the constitutive hyperphosphorylated state of EGFR , sortilin and EGFR interacted in H1650 ( delE746 - A750 ) , H3255 ( L858R ) , and H1975 ( L858R / T790M ) , as attested by immunoprecipitations and PLA ( Fig . 3h , j ) . Interestingly , in the absence of ligand stimula - tion , the EGFR — sortilin interaction remained stronger in EGFR - mutated cell lines ( Fig . 3i ) than in A549 cells , suggesting that the greater ability of the EGFR mutants to be internalized 42 , 43 facilitates their interaction with sortilin . Surprisingly , although EGF stimulation signi ﬁ cantly promoted the EGFR — sortilin interaction in H1650 , H3255 , and A549 cells , it had no such effect in H1975 cells ( Fig . 3i ) . Together , these results suggest that the VPS10 sorting domain of sortilin interacts with EGFR , and that sortilin acts as a sorting receptor for EGFR following its internalization . Sortilin depletion retains EGFR at the cell surface . Several lines of evidence indicate that sortilin is involved in EGFR traf ﬁ cking , independently of EGF - induced EGFR internalization . Consequently , the absence of sortilin could limit EGFR endocytosis from the plasma membrane . Interestingly , in sortilin - depleted A549 cells 27 , EGFR internalization was perturbed , as revealed by immunostaining showing EGFR clusters at the plasma membrane irrespective of EGF stimulation ( Fig . 4a , insets 1 – 1 to 2 – 2 ) . Confocal images showed that sortilin depletion signi ﬁ cantly altered the ratio of whole - cell EGFR vs . intracyto - plasmic EGFR ( Fig . 4b ) . These observations were supported by ﬂ uorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) analysis in which we measured the cell surface level of EGFR to monitor its Fig . 3 C - terminally truncated sortilin strongly interacts with EGFR at the cell surface independently of ligand stimulation . a HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with either full - length ( FL ) or C - terminally truncated ( Δ c ) sortilin - GFP .

Following EGF stimulation , control cells exhibited an increase of EGFR phosphorylation , followed by MAPK activation , as evidenced by elevated phosphorylation of both AKT and ERK1 / 2 ( Fig . 4e ) . Furthermore , whole - cell levels of EGFR decreased with increasing treatment time , consistent with the lysosomal degradation of the protein . Importantly , disruption of EGFR internalization delayed EGFR turnover and increased both the activity and amount of EGFR . Strikingly , sortilin depletion maintained EGFR in a constitutive hyperphosphorylated state , in agreement with its plasma membrane retention 14 ( Fig . 4d , e ) . Hence , EGFR - induced constitutive signaling , as attested by phosphorylation of the MAP kinases AKT and ERK1 / 2 ( Fig . 4d , e ) , suggesting that EGFR plasma membrane retention drives proliferative signaling in the absence of sortilin . As expected , silencing of EGFR in A549 sortilin - depleted cells decreased MAP kinase signaling ( Fig . 4f ) . Accordingly , sortilin depletion signi ﬁ cantly increased 5 - ethynyl - 2 ʹ - deoxyuridine ( EdU ) incorporation , re ﬂ ecting a higher rate of cell proliferation , in comparison with control cells ( Fig . 4g ) . However , EGF stimulation did not increase cell proliferation of sortilin - depleted cells , consistent with the basal hyper - activated status of both EGFR and its downstream network ( Fig . 4g ) . Interestingly , EGFR silencing signi ﬁ cantly decreased the prolif - eration of sortilin - depleted cells , supporting the idea that the higher proliferation rate of these cells is governed by sustained EGFR proliferative signaling . We reproduced these results in two other EGFR - ampli ﬁ ed cell lines , the human glioblastoma U87 - MG and the epidermoid squamous A431 cells ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 2b – g ) . However , to rule out the possibility that sortilin depletion impairs the EGFR degradative pathway , we individually inhibited the lysosome and proteasome . Ba ﬁ lomycin A1 , a lysosomal acidi ﬁ cation inhibitor , decreased EGFR degradation upon EGF stimulation in both control and sortilin - depleted cells ; by contrast , the proteasome inhibitor MG132 had no such effect . Conversely , sortilin degradation was limited upon proteasome inhibition ( Fig . 4h ) . These results suggest that sortilin is transiently associated with , and acts as a sorting receptor from the plasma membrane , and that the EGFR degradative pathway remains functional despite the absence of sortilin . Furthermore , sortilin depletion did not increase the EGFR mRNA level irrespective of the presence of EGF ( Fig . 4i ) , supporting the idea that EGFR accumulation in sortilin - depleted cells corresponds to mis - sorting of EGFR from the plasma membrane . Our results suggested that sortilin limits EGFR proliferative signaling . Interestingly , H1975 cells expressed a lower level of endogenous sortilin than other EGFR - mutated cell lines ( Fig . 4j ) . Because H1975 harbors the EGFR T790M point mutation , which is insensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) therapy , we transiently overexpressed sortilin in these cells . Transient sortilin overexpression in H1975 cells decreased both AKT and ERK phosphorylation under basal conditions ( Fig . 4k ) , as well as cell proliferation ( Fig . 4l ) , suggesting that sortilin alters the malignant behavior of these cells . Thus , despite the strong EGFR — sortilin interaction in the H1975 cell line ( Fig . 3i ) , the weak expression of endogenous sortilin seems insuf ﬁ cient to counteract the EGFR proliferative signaling pathway . Strikingly , sortilin overexpression reversed the ge ﬁ tinib - resistance phenotype of H1975 cells , as evidenced by reduced AKT and ERK phosphorylations in comparison with control cells ( Fig . 4m ) . Together , these results demonstrate that loss of sortilin impairs EGFR internalization and sustains its proliferative signaling . Sortilin depletion accelerates tumor growth in vivo . Previous studies show that sortilin is required for EGFR turnover in vitro , and that sortilin downregulation sustains EGFR proliferative signaling . To determine whether the loss of sortilin is important for tumor maintenance in vivo , we examined the effect of sortilin depletion on human adenocarcinoma xenografts . For this purpose , we subcutaneously engrafted A549 control or sortilin - depleted cells into nude immunode ﬁ cient mice , and then followed tumor growth . As expected , sortilin - depleted cells exhibited much faster tumor growth than control cells from the ﬁ fteenth day onward ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Consistent with this , tumors derived from sortilin - depleted cells were signi ﬁ cantly larger on day 25 ( Fig . 5a , b ) . To further assess the proportion of proliferative cells in each group of engrafted mice , we performed immunohistochemical ( IHC ) staining for Ki - 67 , a marker of proliferation . In agreement with their faster growth , sortilin - depleted cells had an elevated Ki - 67 proliferative index ( ~ 80 % ) relative to control cells ( ~ 25 % ) ( Fig . 5c , d ) . Together , these results show that loss of sortilin dramatically increases cell proliferation , and consequently tumor growth , in vivo . Sortilin downregulation is associated with poorer prognosis . Our results obtained on animal models reveal that loss of sortilin Fig . 4 Loss of sortilin greatly perturbs EGFR internalization and dramatically promotes EGFR signaling . a A549 cells expressing shRNA targeting sortilin and control cells ( pLKO ) were stimulated with EGF ( 50 ng / mL ) for 30 min , and then ﬁ xed and immunolabeled for EGFR .

To determine whether this phenomenon is also relevant to human cancer , we performed IHC analysis on 78 patients with non - small cell lung adenocarcinomas ( NSCLCs ) . We analyzed sortilin expression according to grade : grades I – III correspond to well - differentiated , moderately differentiated , and poorly differentiated pathology , respectively ; this grade increases with the tumor aggressiveness . We complemented this approach by calculating the percentage of Ki - 67 - positive nuclei . Interest - ingly , sortilin expression decreased signi ﬁ cantly with pathologic grade ( Fig 6a , b , insets 1 – 3 ) , whereas the percentage of positive nuclei was signi ﬁ cantly higher in grade III than in grades I and II ( Fig . 6c , d insets 4 – 6 ) . These results support the relationship between grade and aberrant cell proliferation , which is associated with poor prognosis and survival in patients with lung adeno - carcinomas 44 . These observations were further supported by the pattern of TTF - 1 expression . TTF - 1 is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinomas , but loss of TTF - 1 is associated with tumor aggressiveness and reduced median survival 45 , 46 ( Supplementary Fig . 3 : as with sortilin , expression of TTF - 1 decreases with grade ) . Thus , reduced expression of sortilin in NSCLC patients was correlated with increased cellular proliferation , accelerated tumor growth , and TTF - 1 – negative poorly differentiated tumors . Collectively , the phenotypes of sortilin - downregulated tumors were associated with an NSCLC subtype with poorer prognosis . In light of these results , we performed statistical analysis of publicly available adenocarcinoma data sets from the MSKCC cBioPortal database 47 , 48 , based on The Cancer Genome Atlas 1 ( TCGA ) and the gene expression omnibus ( GEO ) . We manually sorted datasets based on overall survival and expression of SORT1 , the gene encoding sortilin . The Kaplan − Meier method was used to plot the overall survival of adenocarcinoma patients ( n = 673 ) strati ﬁ ed by expression of SORT1 , and statistical signi ﬁ cance was assessed by log - rank test 49 , 50 . High expression of sortilin ( black curve ) was signi ﬁ cantly correlated ( log - rank p = 3 × 10 − 9 ) with better survival , in contrast to low expression ( orange curve ) ( Fig . 6e ) . From these results , we analyzed publicly available data to investigate whether sortilin expression could be affected by oncogenic drivers such as KRAS or EGFR ampli ﬁ ca - tion , as observed in lung adenocarcinoma . Although our statistical tests supported no signi ﬁ cance of KRAS mutations , they highlighted an increase in SORT1 expression in EGFR - overexpressing tumors ( Fig . 6f ) . Next , we investigated SORT1 expression in a cohort of patients with low or high - EGFR expression . Our analyses revealed that sortilin expression was signi ﬁ cantly higher in patients with EGFR ampli ﬁ cation ( Fig . 6g ) . Because EGFR ampli ﬁ cation is correlated with poor outcome , we sorted and curated patients ( n = 522 ) with high - EGFR expression ( n = 30 ) . Strikingly , Kaplan − Meier analysis revealed that high - SORT1 expression in EGFR - overexpressing patients signi ﬁ cantly increased overall survival ( Fig . 6h ) . Because 75 % of tumors with EGFR ampli ﬁ cation harbor EGFR mutations 51 , 52 , we analyzed the TCGA data to investigate sortilin expression in these patients . Interestingly , lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR TKI — sensitive mutations expressed high levels of SORT1 ( Fig . 6i ) . Given that EGFR is often associated with initiation and the progression of NSCLC 53 , 54 and sortilin attenuates EGFR proliferative signaling , as observed above in a TKI - resistant cell line ( Fig . 4k , i , m ) , sortilin expression in tumors potentially represents a useful predictive marker of patient outcome . a c Sortilin ShRNA Mice 1 Mice 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 Days A549 pLKO 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 T u m o r s i z e ( mm 3 ) b pLKO SortilinShRNA d 0 20 40 60 80 100 K i 67 po s i t i v e c e ll s ( % ) pLKO SortilinShRNA * * * Tumor size at day 15 0 200 400 600 T u m o r s i z e ( mm 3 ) * * pLKO SortilinShRNA Tumor size at day 25 0 20040060080010001200 1400 1600180020002200 * * * 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 A549 sortilin ShRNA pLKO Mice 1 Mice 2 Fig . 5 Sortilin depletion dramatically accelerates tumor growth in vivo . a Tumor growth curves showing evolution of the tumor volume after engraftment of 1 × 10 6 sortilin - depleted or control A549 cells ( pLKO ) . b Grouped column scatter shows the mean difference tumor volume between sortilin - depleted and control cells , 15 and 25 days after engraftment . c 25 days after engraftment , all mice were killed , and tumors were excised and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis .

Our ﬁ nding supports a model in which sortilin sorts EGFR , modulating its accumulation at the cell surface , and thereby prevents autocrine and sustained signaling , both of which are hallmarks of cancer . The role of sortilin in plasma membrane EGFR regulation and the putative underlying mechanism are summarized in Fig . 7 .

This inhibitory mechanism is of central importance to the control of signal duration and intensity . Several mechan - isms can result in activation of TKR pathways during initiation and progression of NSCLC , including TKR ampli ﬁ cation , upregulated autocrine signaling , and mutations 36 , 40 , 42 . Both histopathological and molecular genetics studies have shown that aberrant activation of TKRs is more frequent in lung adenocarcinomas than in other cancers 1 , 55 . EGFR plays key roles in processes related to tumorigenesis , including cell proliferation , cell survival , and metastasis . Because the EGFR downstream signaling network is one of the most frequently deregulated pathways in human cancer , and because multiple facets of EGFR traf ﬁ cking remain unresolved 19 , the roles played by sorting proteins such as sortilin in EGFR regulation have attracted increasing attention . At the cellular level , the EGFR — sortilin interaction is supported by the results of multilayered analysis of the EGFR interactome following ligand - induced EGFR traf ﬁ cking 56 . The initial site of the EGFR — sortilin interaction remains to be elucidated . Because sortilin resides mainly in the TGN , it was tempting to speculate that sortilin regulates the anterograde transport of EGFR signaling . Our observations made by inhibit - ing endocytosis or in cells expressing a recycling - defective variant of sortilin indicated that the two proteins interact primarily at the plasma membrane . Interestingly , the EGFR — sortilin interaction was independent of EGF - induced EGFR phosphorylation and endocytosis and did not trigger EGFR phosphorylation . In the absence of sortilin , almost all EGFR remained at the cell surface , supporting the idea that sortilin is not required to localize EGFR to the plasma membrane following post - translational modi ﬁ cation . Thus , these observations indicate that sortilin is not a ligand for EGFR , and is instead involved in turnover of EGFR at the plasma membrane . Downregulation of sortilin affected EGFR internalization and increased the proportion of the receptor localized to the cell surface . Plasma membrane retention of EGFR subjects the receptor to free ligands , and sustains both its proliferative and potential autocrine signaling . Therefore , loss of sortilin promotes EGFR proliferative signaling and accelerates tumor growth in vivo . Overexpression of sortilin in TKI - resistant cells resulted in strong decreases in cell proliferation and ge ﬁ tinib resistance . Sortilin in the mutant EGFR lung cancer context appears to be acting as a tumor suppressor or inhibiting malignant behavior , while in other cancers it appears to act as an oncogene or promote malignant behavior 57 – 59 . These differences will need to be resolved in future studies . Lung adenocarcinoma patients with weak expression of sortilin have poorly differ - entiated tumors with accelerated proliferation . Overall , the pathologic characteristics of sortilin - downregulated tumors correspond to a subtype of adenocarcinoma with poorer prog - nosis . Interestingly , in patients whose tumors express high levels of EGFR , which is associated with poor prognosis value , higher expression of SORT1 signi ﬁ cantly improved the overall survival . In summary , our ﬁ ndings describe for the ﬁ rst time the role of sortilin in limiting proliferative signaling by EGFR , and reveal a connection between sortilin expression and patient outcome . The striking role of sortilin in EGFR traf ﬁ cking should be investigated in the context of other TKRs that are involved in initiation and progression of lung adenocarcinoma . Methods Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation . For immunoblotting , cells were washed with ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS , Gibco , France ) , and then lysed in cell lysis buffer ( Cell Signaling ) containing 1 % protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , France ) and phosphatase inhibitor ( Sigma , France ) . Cell lysates were soni ﬁ ed ( Vibra - Cell Soni ﬁ er , set at 50 % amplitude ) three times ( 2s each , with at least 1min of rest on ice pulses ) and clari ﬁ ed by centrifugation at 18 , 000× g . Solubilized proteins ( 30 µ g ) were subjected to SDS - PAGE and western blot analysis using antibodies speci ﬁ c for sortilin ( BD Bioscience , # 612101 , 1 / 500 ) , P - EGFR ( Tyr 1068 , # 3777 , 1 / 1000 ; Cell Signaling , Ozyme , France ) , EGFR ( Cell Signaling , # 4267 , 1 / 1000 , Ozyme or Life Technologies , clone H11 # MA5 - 13070 , 1 / 500 , Fischer Scienti ﬁ c , France ) , pERK1 / 2 ( Thr202 / Thr204 , # 4370 , 1 / 1000 , Cell Signaling , Ozyme ) , ERK1 / 2 ( Cell Signaling , # 9102 , 1 / 1000 , Ozyme ) , pAKT ( Ser 473 , # 4060 1 / 1000 , Cell Signaling , Ozyme ) AKT ( Cell Signaling , # 4691 , 1 / 1000 , Ozyme ) , EEA1 ( Cell Signaling , # 3288 , 1 / 1000 , Ozyme ) , Rab5 ( Cell Signaling , # 3547 , 1 / 1000 , Ozyme ) , LAMP2 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 18822 , 1 / 200 , Tebu , France ) , TGN46 ( Sigma , 1 / 200 , # T7576 ) , v5 , GFP tag ( Life Technologies , respectively # MA5 - 15253 , 1 / 1000 , and # MA5 - 15256 , 1 / 1000 , Fischer Scienti ﬁ c ) , and actin ( Sigma , # A2066 , 1 / 10000 ) ( used as a loading control ) . Immunoreactive bands were detected with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Dako , 1 / 1000 , Agilent , France ) in the presence of enhanced chemiluminescence substrate . For IP , cells were washed with ice - cold PBS and lysed in IP lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 2 mM EDTA ; all reagents from Sigma ) containing 1 % protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) and phosphatase inhibitor ( Roche ) . Lysates were clari ﬁ ed by centrifugation at 18 , 000× g . Cell lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4°C with 10 % ( v / v ) cocktail from a non - protein A — producing Staphylococcus aureus strain ( Sigma ) . Precleared lysates were clari ﬁ ed by centrifugation for 5 min at 18 , 000× g . A volume of 1mL of Protein A Sepharose beads ( Sigma ) was washed three times with IP buffer and resuspended in 1mL of IP buffer . Then , 200 µ g protein lysate and 2 µ g antibody were solubilized in 1mL IP buffer and 50 µ L of previously prepared Protein A Sepharose beads were added to the suspension and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking . Control lysate was mixed with normal mouse - IgG or normal rabbit - IgG and beads . The next morning , immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1mL of IP lysis buffer at 4°C , and then boiled in loading buffer ( Bio - Rad ) at 95 °C for 5min . The beads were removed by centrifugation , and immunoprecipitated lysates were subjected to SDS - PAGE and western blot analysis ( Bio - Rad ) . Cell culture and treatments .

Sortilin is mainly localized at the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) , and the plasma membrane fraction of sortilin cycles continually between the cell surface and the TGN via the endosomes ( 1 ) . Sortilin binds both unstimulated and stimulated EGFR to allow their internalization ( 2 ) . Thus , EGFR undergoes intracellular traf ﬁ cking and sortilin mediates its loading in intraluminal vesicles ( 3 ) . This ultimately results either in EGFR release through exosomes ( 4 ) or receptor degradation ( 5 ) , thus ensuring signal termination . Conversely , sortilin downregulation impairs EGFR internalization ( 6 ) , and EGFR consequently retained at the cell surface . Moreover , in sortilin - downregulated cells , EGFR exists in a hyperphosphorylated state , and transduces a constitutive survival signal that promotes tumor growth ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 01172 - 5 12 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 1182 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 01172 - 5 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications Immuno ﬂ uorescence and confocal microscopy analysis . Cells grown on glass coverslips and were washed twice in ice - cold PBS before ﬁ xation in methanol or 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10min on ice . After ﬁ xation , the cells were washed with wash buffer solution , PBS containing 1 % ( w / v ) BSA , and blocked for 30min with PBS containing 3 % BSA ( IDbio ) . The cells were immunolabeled at 4°C overnight with the indicated primary antibody , anti - EGFR ( Cell Signaling , Ozyme , # 4267 , 1 / 100 ) , anti - sortilin ( Abcam , # ab16640 , 1 / 100 , France ) in blocking solution . The following morning , the cells were washed three times ( PBS , 1 % BSA ) , and primary antibodies were labeled either with Alexa Fluor 594 – conjugated anti - rabbit - IgG or Alexa Fluor 488 – conjugated anti - mouse - IgG antibodies ( 1 : 1000 ; Life Technologies ) for 2h at room temperature . The cells were washed three times ( PBS , 1 % BSA ) . Finally , the cells were mounted using Fluoroshield mounting media ( Sigma ) containing 4 ʹ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) to stain the nuclei . For endocytic assay , biotinylated EGF , complexed to Alexa Fluor 647 , was used following manufacturer ’ s instructions ( Life Technologies , France , # E35351 ) . Fluorescence images were obtained using epi ﬂ uorescence microscopes ( Zeiss Axiovert ) equipped with a laser - scanning confocal imaging system ( Zeiss LSM 510 META or LSM800 ) . Mander ’ s coef ﬁ cients were calculated using the Zeiss LSM 510 META or ZEN software ( Zeiss ) on non - saturated pictures with an optical slice of 0 . 8 µ m . At least 30 cells were acquired for each condition . Cell surface expression of either EGFR or sortilin ( calculated from the difference between the whole - cell and the intracellular means of ﬂ uorescence ) were analyzed using the ImageJ software ( ImageJ ) . For PLA , the cells were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10min , and then permeabilized for 30 min on ice in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma ) in PBS . Subsequently , the cells were washed with PBS , and blocking solution ( 2 % BSA in PBS ) was applied for 30min at 37°C in a humidi ﬁ ed chamber . Primary antibodies against EGFR ( mouse monoclonal , 1 : 100 , Life Technologies ) and sortilin ( rabbit polyclonal , 1 : 100 , Abcam ) diluted in blocking solution were added , and the sample was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C . The cells were then washed with buffer A of the Duolink II proximity ligation assay kit ( Olink Bioscience , Sigma ) . Subsequently , the Duolink II PLA probe anti - mouse Minus and the Duolink II PLA probe anti - rabbit Plus were added to the cells , and the sample was incubated for 60min at 37 °C . To link the two probes , the cells were washed in buffer A and incubated for 30min at 37°C in Duolink II ligation buffer diluted in ﬁ ltered distilled water containing ligase . Following ligation , the cells were washed in buffer A , and then incubated for 100 min at 37 °C with the Duolink II orange ampli ﬁ cation buffer containing polymerase . The cells were then washed three times in buffer B and mounted with in - situ mounting media containing DAPI . Quantitative analyses obtained from each independent sample were performed using the ImageJ software ( NIH , Bethesda ) based on the mean ﬂ uorescence values . At least 50 cells were acquired for each condition , and the results are presented as ratios relative to the control cells . Endosome / subcellular fractionation . Cells were washed with ice - cold PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) , rapidly swelled with osmotic buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl ( Sigma ) , pH 7 . 4 ) , and scraped into homogenization buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 1mM EGTA , 0 . 5mM , EDTA , 0 . 25 M sucrose ; all reagents from Sigma ) containing 1 % protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor . The disrupted cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer ( IKALabortechnik ) , and post - nuclear supernatants ( PNS ) were obtained by centrifugation of the homogenate for 10min at 1000 g . PNS were centrifuged at 10 , 000× g for 20 min at 4°C to pellet the plasma membrane , mitochondria , and rough endoplasmic reticulum . The PNS were then fractionated on a discontinuous 10 – 30 % ( w / v ) OptiPrep ( Sigma ) density gradient as described by Li and Donowitz 49 . A 50 % ( w / v ) OptiPrep working solution ( WS ) was prepared by mixing 5 volumes of OptiPrep with 1 volume of diluent solution ( 0 . 25M sucrose , 6mM EDTA , 60mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 ) . Then , the WS of 50 % OptiPrep was diluted in homogenization media ( HM ) ( 0 . 25 M sucrose , 1 mM EDTA , 10mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 ) to obtain nine solutions containing different percentages of OptiPrep ( 10 % , 12 . 5 % , 15 % , 17 . 5 % , 20 % , 22 . 5 % , 25 % , 27 . 5 % , and 30 % ) . The OptiPrep cushions were layered manually in an ultracentrifuge tube , with higher concentrations at the bottom and lower concentrations at the top . The PNS were diluted into the HM and loaded onto the top of the light cushion before to at ultracentrifugation at 100 , 000× g for 16h at 4°C . The following morning , 20 fractions of the 10 layers were collected , and the proteins were precipitated using 20 % ( w / v ) of trichloroacetic acid ( Sigma ) and 10 % ( w / v ) of ice - cold acetone ( Sigma ) . The precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 18 , 000× g for 30 min at 4°C , then washed twice in ice - cold acetone by repeated centrifugation of 18 , 000× g for 2min at 4°C . Protein pellets were solubilized in the loading buffer and boiled at 95°C for 5 min . Proteins were subjected to SDS − PAGE in the order of collection ( i . e . , from light to the heavy subcellular membrane vesicles ) , and western blot analysis was performed with the corresponding antibodies . Mice and in vivo tumor growth . Nude female mice were obtained from Janvier Labs ( France ) . Mice were housed in speci ﬁ c pathogen – free conditions , and experiments were done in accordance with the guidelines of the French Veterinary Department . Young mice ( 6 – 8 weeks of age ) were injected subcutaneously in the left thigh with 1 ×10 6 cells in 20 µ L of PBS . Tumor volume ( = Length ×Width × ( ( Length + Width ) / 2 ) ) was measured twice weekly . Mice were killed 25 days after injection . Tumors were collected , ﬁ xed with formaldehyde , embedded in paraf ﬁ n , and processed for IHC . Patients and immunohistochemistry . Lung adenocarcinoma tissue microarrays containing 48 cases of lung adenocarcinoma , with information about pathological grade and TTF - 1 IHC results , were provided by US Biomax ( BCS04017a ; US Biomax , United States ) . In addition , 30 lung adenocarcinoma tumors in paraf ﬁ n - embedded blocks were obtained from the Tumor Bank ( Biolim ) of Limoges University Hospital , under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board ( AC - 2013 - 1853 , DC - 2011 - 1264 ) of the Anatomo - Pathology department of CHU Dupuytren Limoges . All patients were informed of the use of their tissue samples in research studies . Immunohistochemical and hematoxylin / eosin staining was performed on 5 - μ m - thick consecutive sections . Antibodies against sortilin ( Alomone , Israël , 1 / 175 , # ANT - 009 ) , EGFR ( Cell Signaling , Ozyme , # 4267 , 1 / 25 ) , and Ki - 67 ( Dako , clone MIB - 1 , # M7240 , 1 / 200 ) were used for tissue labeling on a Leica Bond - Max using the Bond Polymer Re ﬁ ne Detection kit . For sortilin and EGFR labeling , samples were pretreated with ER1 for 5min ; for Ki - 67 labeling , samples were pretreated for 20min with ER2 . Labeling was performed with the same device ( Leica Bond - Max ) , and slides were mounted in a non - aqueous mounting medium . Images were acquired on a Hamamatsu slide scanner . Each image capture was visually quanti ﬁ ed by the adapted Hirsh score method 64 , performed in a triple - blind manner . To evaluate the percentage of Ki - 67 - positive nuclei , the publicly available software Immunoratio 65 was used . Bioinformatic analyses . Overall survival and vital status were obtained using the Kaplan − Meier Plotter for lung cancer ( kmplot ) , and computed as a function of sortilin expression using data extracted from GEO ( n = 673 patients ) data sets with accession numbers GSE14814 , GSE19188 , GSE29013 , GSE30219 , GSE31210 , GSE3141 , GSE31908 , GSE37745 , and GSE50081 . EGFR and sortilin expression data and corresponding overall patient survival and vital status data were extracted from the cBioPortal data set taken from TCGA archives ( TCGA , Nature 2014 ; Provisional TCGA ) , representing data from a total of 522 lung adenocarcinoma patients .
