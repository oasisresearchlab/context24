Introduction Several unconventional myosins , including myosin I , V , and VI , have been implicated in membrane traffic in the actin cortex ( Eichler et al . , 2006 ; Buss and Kendrick - Jones , 2008 ; Kim and Flavell , 2008 ) , which is generally found to be polarized , with the actin filament barbed ends being attached to the plasma membrane . Their role in these processes has been inferred from loss - of - function experiments in vivo ( Buss et al . , 2001 ; Varadi et al . , 2005 ; Krendel et al . , 2007 ) . Myosin VI has been impli - cated in moving vesicles from the cell surface to the interior of cells , through the cortical actin meshwork ( Buss et al . , 2001 ) , which is in keeping with its ability to move toward the pointed ends of actin filaments ( Wells et al . , 1999 ) . Cortical F - actin is generally organized as a thin ( < 0 . 5 µm ) dense network below the plasma membrane ( Mooseker , 1985 ) . There are many examples of using an exposed cellular cyto - skeleton for in vitro experiments ( Sawada and Sheetz , 2002 ; Sivaramakrishnan et al . , 2008a ; Brawley and Rock , 2009 ) . The choice of cell type that is used to obtain a native actin cytoskeleton is critical , depending on the type of informa - tion on myosin function one is interested in obtaining . Micro - dissection of Nitella axillaris to expose the polarized actin cytoskeleton was used to study movement of 1 - µm - sized micro - spheres coated with muscle myosin II ( Sheetz and Spudich , 1983 ) . The uniform polarity of the long actin bundles in N . axillaris enabled the establishment of the first quantitative in vitro motility assay with muscle myosin speeds comparable to those seen in muscle ( Sheetz and Spudich , 1983 ) . Detergent extraction is another way to reveal and maintain an intact cytoskeleton ( Svitkina et al . , 1995 ) . Brawley and Rock ( 2009 ) recently examined the movement of single dimeric forms of myosin V , VI , and X on detergent - extracted Drosophila S2 and mammalian COS - 7 and U2OS cells . They found that myosin V selectively moves toward the cell periphery , that myosin VI moves toward the cell center , and that myosin X is recruited to filopodia . These cell types have an actin cortical region that extends in toward the cell interior by < 1 µm . The goal of our study was to define quantitatively the behavior , on a cellular F - actin interlaced network , of nanospheres coated with mul - tiple copies of myosin VI in both monomeric and dimeric states , and to compare and contrast them . Thus , we needed a cell type with an extensive lamellipodial actin cortex . We chose the keratocyte lamellipodium , which has been characterized using light ( Schaub et al . , 2007 ) and electron microscopy ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1998 ) . It spans  30 × 10 µm , providing a large U nconventional myosins interact with the dense cortical actin network during processes such as membrane trafficking , cell migration , and mechanotransduction . Our understanding of unconven - tional myosin function is derived largely from assays that examine the interaction of a single myosin with a single actin filament . In this study , we have devel - oped a model system to study the interaction between multiple tethered unconventional myosins and a model F - actin cortex , namely the lamellipodium of a migrat - ing fish epidermal keratocyte . Using myosin VI , which moves toward the pointed end of actin filaments , we directly determine the polarity of the extracted kerato - cyte lamellipodium from the cell periphery to the cell nucleus . We use a combination of experimentation and simulation to demonstrate that multiple myosin VI mol - ecules can coordinate to efficiently transport vesicle - size cargo over 10 µm of the dense interlaced actin network . Furthermore , several molecules of monomeric myosin VI , which are nonprocessive in single molecule assays , can coordinate to transport cargo with similar speeds as dimers . Coupled myosin VI motors facilitate unidirectional movement on an F - actin network Sivaraj Sivaramakrishnan and James A .

Results and discussion Fig . 1 a shows a fluorescence image of the keratocyte actin cytoskeleton after extraction , displaying the characteristic densely packed interlaced actin network ( Schaub et al . , 2007 ) . High - resolution images obtained using the platinum replica technique ( Fig . 1 b ) confirm that the dense interlaced actin network after detergent extraction is maintained in the absence of fixatives . Although endocytosis may or may not occur in the keratocyte lamellipodium , this dense actin meshwork is likely to be similar to the smaller actin cortex found in other cells . To model the movement of endocytic vesicles on such a network , we use myosin VI coupled to 200 - nm - diameter fluorescent nanospheres . Nanospheres coated with a single myosin VI artificial dimer land on the keratocyte network , move a short distance ( < 1 µm ) , then detach and diffuse away ( Fig . 1 c ) . Myosin VI artificial dimers were created by the insertion of a GCN4 leucine zipper coiled - coil motif in its tail domain ( De La Cruz et al . , 2001 ) . Insertion of GCN4 ensures dimerization , as has been observed for artificial dimers in single molecule experiments ( Rock et al . , 2001 ; Okten et al . , 2004 ) . Fig . 1 d shows trajectories of these nanospheres , starting with their landing on ( top ) and ending with their detachment from ( bottom ) the keratocyte actin network . The short run lengths ( < 1 µm ) are consistent with previous mea - surements ( Sweeney et al . , 2007 ; Brawley and Rock , 2009 ) . Myosin VI heads release from the actin filament when bound to ATP . Occasionally , when both heads bind an ATP , the dimer releases from the actin and the nanosphere diffuses into solution , terminating the run . When multiple myosin VI dimers are coupled together through a nanosphere , the nanosphere will release from the actin network only when all the heads are bound to ATP . The frequency of this depends on the rate at which both heads of a dimer are simultaneously bound to ATP ( < 1 s  1 ) relative to the rate at which the myosin transitions back to a state when it surface for observing interaction of unconventional myosins . The actin polarity is thought to be uniform ( Small et al . , 1995 ) , with the pointed ends of the actin filaments pointing inward toward the nucleus . This widely held hypothesis is supported by the findings of our study . Myosin VI is necessary for timely transport of endocytic cargo such as transferrin to early endosomes ( Hasson , 2003 ) . Because actin filaments in the terminal web are polarized with their pointed ends away from the cell edge , myosin VI – based movement of early endosomes along actin filaments has been inferred to facilitate endocytosis ( Mooseker and Tilney , 1975 ) . However , individual myosin VI molecules isolated from cells are monomeric and therefore are nonprocessive ( Lister et al . , 2004 ) . Indeed , several unconventional myosins , including myosin I , VI , and VII , have been shown to be nonprocessive when isolated from cells , leading to questions about whether or how they can transport vesicles / organelles in vivo ( Loubéry and Coudrier , 2008 ) . Myosin VI , although monomeric as a pure pro - tein , binds to endosomes through adaptor proteins such as GIPC and Dab2 , which can dimerize on endocytic vesicles ( Lou et al . , 2001 ; Xu et al . , 1998 ) ; this suggests that myosin VI may func - tion as a dimer in vivo . This suggestion is supported by aniso - tropy Förster resonance energy transfer measurements in vivo that suggest that myosin VI molecules are precisely positioned in close proximity on endosomes ( Altman et al . , 2007 ) . How - ever , whether dimerization is required for processive movement of cargo is unclear . Complicating the issue , myosin VI and V spend most of their time bound to F - actin ( high duty ratio ) , whereas myosin I transitions from a low to high duty ratio motor under load ( De La Cruz et al . , 2001 ; Moore et al . , 2001 ; Laakso et al . , 2008 ) . Multiple myosin heads with high duty ratio could interfere with each other , preventing the movement of cargo bound to multiple motors along the cortical actin mesh . In this study , we examine the coordinated interaction of multiple copies of myosin VI molecules with the isolated kerato - cyte actin network . We address an outstanding question in the unconventional myosin field , namely the ability of multiple myosin Figure 1 .

Note that on occasion , a nanosphere coated with myosin VI lands on a retraction fiber at the rear end of the cell ( green trace at the bottom of Fig . 2 b ) and moves toward the nucleus . To understand how multiple motors coordinate to bring about linear directed motion of nanospheres , we used our detailed knowledge of myosin VI artificial dimer function , obtained from single molecule and kinetic studies , to simulate their move - ment on the keratocyte actin mesh . To capture the interlaced nature of the keratocyte lamellipodium , we digitized platinum replica electron micrographs of extracted keratocytes to obtain the actin tracks encountered by the myosin motors ( Fig . 3 a ) . We created a simplified model for movement of nanospheres brought about by two myosin VI dimers ( Fig . 3 b ) using the following steps : ( 1 ) each myosin VI dimer steps stochastically at a rate limited by the release of ADP from its rear head ( 5 s  1 ; De La Cruz et al . , 2001 ) ; ( 2 ) each myosin VI dimer takes 36 ± 4 - nm steps ( Rock et al . , 2001 ) ; ( 3 ) the next binding site of the lead head of the stepping dimer is constrained such that the distance between the points where myosin VI attaches to the nanospheres ( yellow circles in Fig . 3 b ) is conserved ; ( 4 ) the nanosphere constrains myosin movement such that more than one step by a dimer , before the movement of its counter - part , is not productive ; and ( 5 ) the rear head of a dimer always releases before the lead head . strongly binds to F - actin (  40 s  1 ; Sweeney et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , coupling multiple myosin VI motors is likely to keep a myosin VI – coated nanosphere in contact with the actin network longer before it diffuses away . However , the presence of multiple dimers may also interfere with movement , a result of one dimer trying to step while others are bound with both heads to F - actin . Inter - ference between dimers could prevent the nanosphere from moving along the network . Therefore , we studied the movement of myosin VI – coated nanospheres with multiple dimers to resolve whether they can coordinate movement along the actin network . We found that nanospheres coated with  10 artificial dimers , such that  2 dimers are able to interact with the keratocyte actin mesh ( Fig . S1 ) , move across the entire keratocyte lamellipodium ( Fig . 1 , e and f ) . They move in an almost linear pattern , starting from the cell edge and proceeding toward the cell center ( Fig . 1 g ) . All move - ment , without exception , is directed away from the cell edge toward the cell center ( Fig . 1 g and Video 1 , which is a sample video of Fig . 1 f ) . Platinum replica electron micrographs of the keratocyte lamellipodium acquired after movement of the nanospheres with  10 dimers do not indicate reorganization of or damage to the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 2 a ) . This suggests that the move - ment is brought about by the cooperative interaction between multiple dimers and the actin network and not by reorganiza - tion or reorientation of the lamellipodium , as could be possible with multiple myosin heads . This finding was confirmed by Figure 2 . Myosin VI – coated nanosphere movement on extracted keratocyte actin networks does not result in or require actin filament reorganization .

This model predicts two extremes , with very little distension (  1 nm ) resulting in an unproductive stroke of the myosin and hence no movement of the nanosphere ( Fig . 4 b ) . The second is for very large distensions of the springs (  50 nm ) comparable to the size of the nanosphere . Under these condi - tions , the elastic energy of each myosin VI stroke is stored in the system of springs . The full stroke from each of the four motors contributes to movement of the nanosphere , though with a cumulative dwell time that is considerably less than four times the dwell time of each motor . The net effect is a very large simu - lated speed (  450 nm / s ) , which exceeds the speed of a single myosin VI monomer ( 150 nm / s ) . We estimate a finite flexibility of  3 nm for the myosin VI monomer ( Sivaramakrishnan et al . , 2008b ) . This estimation results in a speed of  50 nm / s for the monomer - coated nanosphere . The simulated trajectories of the monomer - coated nanosphere , similar to the dimer , are linear and directed toward the nucleus ( Fig . 4 c ) . These model predictions were verified by experiments using the myosin VI monomer ( Fig . 4 , d and e ) . The distribution of speeds from the simulation overlaps well with that observed in the experiment ( Fig . 4 , f and g ) . Our simulation does not account for changes in kinetics of monomers when restrained by the finite distensibility of bound heads , which likely reduce the nanosphere speed and lead to broadening of the distribution , as observed in the experiment ( Fig . 4 f ) . The end – end speeds of dimer ( 65 ± 30 nm / s ; n = 156 ) - and monomer ( 47 ± 10 nm / s ; n = 157 ) - coated nanospheres are similar . Furthermore , the movement trajectories for dimer and monomer are qualitatively similar ( Fig . 1 , e – g com - pared with Fig . 3 , d and e ) . Thus , we infer that dimerization , which gates the two heads of an unconventional myosin and renders a single dimer processive in a single - molecule assay , is not essential for processive movement so long as multiple motor heads simulta - neously interact with the actin network . To gain insight into the effect of motor density on move - ment of vesicular cargo , we examined the interaction of nano - spheres with  100 dimers or  200 monomers on the actin network . Simulation and experimentation both confirm that nanospheres with large numbers of dimers or monomers are not stalled , but instead creep along at speeds of  2 - 3 nm / s . Thus , although there appears to be no limit to motor density for vesi - cle movement , large numbers of motors do impede efficiency of cargo transport . Our simplified simulation shows that coordinated move - ment of two myosin dimers on the keratocyte mesh is indeed possible and results in linear directed motion toward the cell center ( Fig . 3 c ) . This model also reproduces the quality of the tracks seen by myosin VI dimer - coated nanospheres seen in Fig . 1 ( e – g ) , and the end – end speed of the nanospheres ( ratio of distance between the ends of the trajectory to the time for cover - ing that distance ; Fig . 3 d ) . The end – end speed includes the lin - earity of the movement path , kinetics of the individual myosins , their step sizes , and their coordination , therefore suggesting that our simplified model captures the essential features of the myosin VI – nanosphere – network interaction . In addition to the end – end speed , our model accurately captures the frame – frame speed ( the ratio of the distance moved between two successive image acquisition frames to the time between frames acquired during imaging on an epifluorescent microscope ) distribution observed in the simulation ( Fig . 3 e ) . Occasional release of the lead head before release of the trailing head of a dimer results in nonproductive steps that slow down the nanosphere . However , occasional multiple steps by a single dimer increase the mean speed of the nanosphere . Effects such as these , which are not modeled in our simulation , likely explain the differences in the width of the end – end speed distributions ( Fig . 3 d ) . Despite the simplifying assumptions , our model veri - fies that the underlying coordinated movement of the two myo - sin dimer molecules enables the nanospheres to traverse the entire actin network . A similar simulation was used to predict the movement of a nanosphere with four bound myosin VI monomers across an interlaced actin network ( Fig . 4 a ) . Each monomer head releases stochastically from the actin network at a rate of 5 s  1 . After its release , it undergoes ATP hydrolysis and a search to find the next actin - binding site at random , although the structure of the head and the polarity of the actin filaments lead to heads binding forward in the pointed - end direction ( Fig . 4 a , middle ) . Upon binding to the actin filament , it strokes and attempts to move the nanosphere forward ( Fig . 4 a , right ) . We modeled the flexibility in the myosin molecule , between the nanosphere and the actin attachments , as an elastic spring that allows finite linear distension . The flexibility in the myosin molecule refers to the effective spring constant of all compliant elements in it . The compliant elements are modeled as linear Hookean springs ( fixed spring constant ) for small distensions with a transition to Figure 3 .

After wash - ing , the nanospheres were bath sonicated ( Branson Ultrasonics Sonifier ; Emerson Industrial Automation ) . Monodispersity was verified using an epifluorescence microscope ( 100× magnification ; Nikon ) . Concentration was determined using a Nanodrop at 400 nm ( Fig . S1 c ) . Coating nanospheres with myosin VI A known number of myosin VI monomer / dimer molecules were mixed with nanospheres and incubated at 22°C for 20 – 30 min . We used nanospheres coated with either 20 monomers or 10 dimers to compare movement with the same approximately four heads interacting with the keratocyte ( Fig . S1 d ) . To obtain nanospheres coated with a single dimer , nanosphere / myosin VI dimer concentrations were adjusted so there were 10 nanospheres for each dimer . Myosin VI : keratocyte interaction Myosin VI – coated nanospheres were mixed into motility buffer ( 25 mM imidazole HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 25 mM KCl , 4 . 5 µM calmodulin , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM DTT , 4 mM MgCl 2 , an oxygen - scavenging system to retard photo damage [ 25 µg / ml glucose oxidase , 45 µg / ml catalase , 31 mM  - mercaptoethanol , and 0 . 5 % glucose ] , an ATP regeneration system [ 0 . 1 mg / ml creatine phosphokinase and 1 mM creatine phosphate ] , 2 mM ATP , and 1 mg / ml BSA ) and transferred to extracted keratocytes . Nano - spheres were imaged at 10 Hz on an upright epifluorescence microsphere ( Nikon ) with a Coolsnap HQ camera ( Photometrics ) . Image analysis of moving myosin VI nanospheres A custom Matlab particle - tracking program ( The MathWorks , Inc . ) was used to identify and track the movement of individual nanospheres . Nano - sphere centers were found by least squares fit to a 2D elliptical Gaussian function with a background ( Churchman et al . , 2005 ) . To compensate for stage drift , fiducial ( stuck to the coverslip surface outside the keratocyte ) nanospheres were tracked and their movement was subtracted . Simulation of nanosphere movement Platinum replica images were digitized to obtain filament tracks using a custom Matlab program . Rotary shadowing with platinum / carbon results in progressively smaller quantities of platinum / carbon coating away from the apical surface of the keratocyte lamellipodium . This is reflected in actin filament darkness in the transmission electron microscope . Myosin VI mole - cules have a limited reach (  20 nm ) , hence we preferentially selected fila - ments , in the images , in the first 2 – 3 layers of the lamellipodium (  30 nm ; Fig . 3 a ) . Nanosphere movement was simulated as described in the text ( see the following section for details ) . Nanosphere simulation algorithm Dimer . Movement of each dimer is considered stochastic , with a single exponential dwell time distribution having a mean of 0 . 2 s ( derived from kinetic measurements ; De La Cruz et al . , 2001 ) . Based on the geometry of the nanosphere ( see Fig . S1 ) ,  2 out of 10 myosin VI dimers coupled to a nanosphere interact with the actin network . Two independent stochastic dwell time sequences for the two dimers were created , and the order of movement was determined based on the dwell times of successive events . Distance between the dimers at the start of the simulation varies randomly from 10 to 100 nm depending on the location of actin filaments at the top of the image . Movement of a dimer consisted of the following steps . ( 1 ) The trail - ing head ( determined by relative “y” location ) releases after a specified dwell time and samples a new binding site 32 ± 4 nm below the leading head , assuming uniform polarity from the cell periphery to the cell center . ( 2 ) A new binding site is selected such that the distance between the nano - spheres attachment point ( the attachment point is the midpoint between the two heads of a dimer ) of the moving dimer and its coupled partner is main - tained relative to its initial value at the start of the simulation . ( 3 ) Centroid of the nanosphere ( halfway between the attachment points of the two myosin VI dimers ) is updated . Release , stroke , and rebinding of the moving dimer are considered instantaneous , which is consistent with the high duty ratio of this motor ( > 0 . 8 ; De La Cruz et al . , 2001 ) . Upon completing its dwell time , the second dimer now moves as per the first three steps outlined above . We assume that in events when a dimer undergoes two or more steps while the other remains bound , only the first step is successful and this dimer has to wait for its partner to step . This is consistent with the finite flexibility of the coupling between the two dimers and the large step size of myosin VI (  36 nm ) . Speed statistics from the simulation are based on movement of the centroid of the nanosphere , as In summary , we used myosin VI to directly test the widely proposed hypothesis that the keratocyte lamellipodium is uni - formly polarized , with barbed ends pointed toward the leading edge of the cell . Our study demonstrates that the extracted keratocyte lamellipodium is a model polarized interlaced actin network with a large area (  10 × 30 µm ) to study the coupled function of unconventional myosins . We find that multiple myosin VI molecules , either artificial dimers or monomers , can cooperate to move endosome - sized nanospheres over the entire length of this model F - actin mesh . Using simplified simulations , we show that the known stroke size , duty ratio , and kinetics of myosin VI , combined with a digitized model of the keratocyte lamellipodium , is sufficient to explain the observed movement of nanospheres coupled to myosin molecules . In the context of multiple myosin VI motors interacting with multiple actin fila - ments in vivo , we find that dimerization of the myosin VI is not essential for processive movement of cargo vesicles under the low load conditions of the assay . The effect of external load on the movement of the dimeric myosin VI – bound nanospheres compared with the monomeric myosin VI – bound nanospheres will be an important future study . This model system will enable the characterization of the function of unconventional myosins , both in their purified form , as in this study , as well as isolated from cells , bound to their native cargo . Materials and methods Keratocyte preparation Keratocytes were isolated from the scales of the Central American cichlid Hypsophrys nicaraguensis ( Cooper and Schliwa , 1986 ; Kolega , 1986 ) . Keratocytes were washed gently with 85 % PBS solution before treatment with extraction buffer ( 50 mM imidazole , pH 6 . 8 , 50 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 4 % polyethylene glycol mol wt 40 , 000 , and 250 nM tetramethylrhodamine [ TMR ] - phalloidin [ Sigma - Aldrich ] ) for 3 – 4 min . Extracted cells were incubated with 85 % PBS with 250 nM TMR - phalloidin in the dark for 30 – 45 min before use in motility assays . Platinum replica electron microscopy Platinum replicas of the extracted cells were prepared as previously described ( Svitkina et al . , 1995 ) . In brief , cells were fixed before or after movement of nanospheres with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 100 mM sodium cacodylate , pH 7 . 3 , followed by sequential treatment with 0 . 1 % aqueous tannic acid and 0 . 2 % uranyl acetate . Cells were prepared for critical point drying by graded washes into 100 % ethanol . Critical point drying was per - formed in a Samdri critical point dryer ( Tousimis Research Corporation ) . Dried specimens were shadowed with platinum and carbon before transfer to formvar - coated grids for viewing on a transmission electron microscope ( JEOL 1230 ; JEOL Ltd . ) . Images were captured by a cooled charge - coupled device camera ( Gatan 967 ; Gatan ) . Myosin VI : constructs and protein preparation Artificial myosin VI dimer was prepared from porcine myosin VI cDNA trun - cated at Arg 992 followed by a leucine zipper ( GCN4 ) to induce artificial dimerization ( Trybus et al . , 1997 ; Altman et al . , 2004 ) . Myosin VI monomer was prepared from porcine myosin VI cDNA truncated at Arg 981 . Both sequences have C - terminal monomeric YFP to facilitate protein quantification and a biotin carboxy carrier protein ( bccp ) sequence , at which a biotin mol - ecule is attached in Sf9 cells ( Tyska et al . , 1999 ) .

We simulate the movement of  20 nano - spheres , thrice , over five separate digitized micrographs of the platinum replica network . Monomer . Similar to the dimer simulation , monomer movement is con - sidered stochastic , with a single exponential dwell time distribution with a mean of 0 . 2 s . Based on the geometry of the nanospheres ( Fig . S1 ) ,  4 out of the 20 monomers coupled to the nanosphere are properly positioned to interact with the F - actin network . Four independent stochastic dwell time sequences were created , and the order of movements was determined based on the dwell times of successive events . The distance between the monomers at the start of the simulation varies randomly , with a minimum separation of 10 nm and a maximum separation of 100 nm for a group of four monomers . The separation distances are based on the area of the nanosphere that can access the keratocyte surface actin network . Monomer movement consisted of the following steps . ( 1 ) The head detaches from the actin filament . Strain between the remaining myosins is now redistributed such that the forces between the remaining heads are balanced . The flexibility ( effective spring constant k eff ) of each head is the same , hence the value of k eff is not required for calculating the force balance . ( 2 ) The head rebinds below the nanosphere attachment point , assuming uniform F - actin polarity from the cell periphery to the cell center . ( 3 ) The head attempts to stroke through 30 ± 4 nm . The flexibility of all heads is identical , hence a force balance between all heads is used to cal - culate the net movement of each nanosphere attachment point and hence the movement of the bead centroid . ( 4 ) The strain in each head is moni - tored throughout the simulation . If the strain exceeds the permissible disten - sion ( variable , see Fig . 4 b ) , stiffness of that particular head – nanosphere attachment connection is set to infinity , and the strains in the system are calculated accordingly . This is consistent with the finite compliance in any head – nanosphere attachment being ironed out , leading to its nonlinear behavior . ( 5 ) After its stroke , the myosin head completes its subsequent dwell before releasing and continuing its stroke . ( 6 ) Unlike the two dimer case discussed above , where we assume steps between the two dimers are sequential , no explicit assumption of the order of strokes is made for the four monomers . The strain buildup in the system automatically adjusts the movement of successive strokes , either by the same myosin head stroking in succession or one head stroking after another . ( 7 ) To simplify our model , the only parameter we have introduced is the permissible distension in the heads . A stroking head that encounters a nonlinear distension of another head is assumed to complete a partial stroke and then release from the actin filament with a dwell time identical to what would occur in the absence of the load . This simplifying assumption , as stated in the text , causes differences between simulation and experimentation . However , in the absence of information on the kinetics of motors under these conditions , we have chosen no changes in kinetics as a first approximation . After this monomer stroke , the next monomer releases , rebinds , and strokes in exactly the same sequence , and the movement is continued . The centroid of a nanosphere is the centroid of the attachment points of the four monomers . Speed statistics from the simulation are based on movement of the centroid of the nanospheres , as observed under the microscope . We simulate the movement of 35 – 40 nanospheres over five separate digitized micrographs of the platinum replica network . Quantifying the number of myosin - binding sites per nanosphere Nanospheres were prepared as described in Nanosphere preparation . Nanosphere preparations were mixed with increasing amounts of d - biotin ( unlabeled ) for 20 min at 20°C . Subsequently , they were incubated with a constant amount of biotin - 4 - fluorescein ( B4F ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . Nanospheres were pelleted by centrifugation ( 35 , 000 g , 15 min ) , and the fluorescence in the supernatant was quantified using a Fluorolog fluorimeter ( Horiba Scientific ) . With increasing d - biotin in solution , fewer B4F molecules bind to the nanosphere , and hence B4F fluorescence in the supernatant in - creases with increasing d - biotin addition . When all of the binding sites on the nanosphere are saturated with d - biotin , B4F fluorescence is unaffected with further d - biotin addition . This can be used to compute the amount of d - biotin that can bind to the nanospheres and hence the number of biotin - binding sites per nanosphere . We estimated the number of biotin - binding sites per nanosphere to be 13 , 600 . From this , assuming there is no cooperative binding of biotin to neutravidin , we estimated that only one in 1 , 000 monomers are bound to the same neutravidin molecule on the surface of the nanosphere . Fluorescent images showing the actin filament organization in the extracted keratocyte lamellipodium were visualized using TMR phalloidin and taken on a microscope ( Eclipse 80 i ) with a Plan - Apochromat VC 60× , 1 . 40 NA oil immersion objective ( Nikon ) at 20°C .

Preparation of myosin VI – coated nanospheres . ( a ) UV - Vis absorbance spectrum of a myosin VI dimer preparation ( the monomer is similar ) showing the YFP absorbance peak at 514 nm , which is used to estimate the myosin VI concentration , based on the YFP extinction coefficient of 94 , 000 M  1 cm  1 .

Lane 2 , myosin VI without neutravidin runs as a single band of mol wt  150 kD . Lane 3 , myosin VI incubated with excess neutravidin for 15 min at 22°C . Myosin VI binding to neu - travidin ( a single neutravidin tetramer has a mol wt of  60 kD ) causes the myosin VI band to shift up on the gel . Identical amounts of myosin VI protein are present in both lanes , but almost all ( > 90 % as assessed by densitometry ) the protein is gel - shifted , confirming the biotinylation of the myosin VI . ( c ) 400 - nm absorbance as a function of known concentration of nanospheres ( 200 - nm diameter ) used in this study . This linear standard curve is used to quantitate the concentration of the nanospheres so that the ratio of myosin VI to nanospheres in each assay can be titrated . Final nanosphere concentration used in the assay was kept to  100 pM . ( d ) Estimation of the number of myosin VI molecules that interact with the actin network based on the geometry of the nano - sphere and the size of the myosin VI molecules . Two examples are depicted : ( left ) a nanosphere coated with  35 myosin VI artificial dimers and ( right ) a nanosphere coated with  15 myosin VI artificial dimers . We assumed that the dimers are distributed uniformly over the surface of the nanosphere . Myosin VI molecules ( both dimers and monomers ) have a large reach from the nanosphere attachment site to the actin - binding site by virtue of their large step size and stroke size ( Rock , R . S . , S . E . Rice , A . L . Wells , T . J . Purcell , J . A . Spudich , and H . L . Sweeney . 2001 . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA . 98 : 13655 – 13659 ; Sivaramakrishnan , S . , B . J . Spink , A . Y . Sim , S . Doniach , and J . A . Spudich . 2008 . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA . 105 : 13356 – 13361 ) . We estimate this reach to be  20 nm based on structural studies of myosin VI ( Ménétrey , J . , P . Llinas , M . Mukherjea , H . L . Sweeney , and A . Houdusse . 2007 . Cell . 131 : 300 – 308 ; Spink , B . J . , S . Sivaramakrishnan , J . Lipfert , S . Doniach , and J . A . Spudich . 2008 . Nat . Struct . Mol . Biol . 15 : 591 – 597 ) . Based on this estimate , we find that  20 % of the surface area of the nanosphere can access the actin network on the surface of the keratocyte . Therefore , for N myosin molecules coated on the nanosphere surface ,  N / 5 myosin molecules can access the actin network . For a nanosphere coated with  10 myosin VI dimers ,  2 dimers can access the actin network , and in a nanosphere coated with  20 myosin VI monomers ,  4 dimers can access the actin network . ( left ) For  35 myosins on the nanosphere ,  7 can interact with the actin network . ( right ) For  15 myosins on the nanosphere ,  3 can interact with the actin network . JCB S2 Video 1 .
