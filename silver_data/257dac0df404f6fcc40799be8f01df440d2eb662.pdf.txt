We have previously shown that activated microglia , through an ERK ( extracel - lular signal - regulated kinase ) - regulated PGE 2 ( prostaglandin E 2 ) signaling mechanism , maintain neuronal hyperexcitability in the lumbar dorsal horn . Here , we examined whether microglial cells in the thalamus contribute to the modulation of chronic pain after SCI , and whether microglial activation is governed by spinally mediated increases in the microglial activator cysteine – cysteine chemokine ligand 21 ( CCL21 ) . We report that CCL21 is upregulated in dorsal horn neurons , that tissue levels are increased in the dorsal horn and ventral posterolateral ( VPL ) nucleus of the thalamus 4 weeks after SCI , and that the increase can be differentially reduced by spinal blockade at T1 or L1 . In intact animals , electrical stimulation of the spinothalamic tract induces increases in thalamic CCL21 levels . Recombinant CCL21 injected into the VPL of intact animals transiently activates microglia and induces pain - related behaviors , effects that could be blocked with minocycline . After SCI , intra - VPL antibody - mediated neutralization of CCL21 decreases microglial activation and evoked hyperexcitability of VPL neurons , and restores nociceptive thresholds to near - normal levels . These data identify a novel pathway by which SCI triggers upregulation of the neuroimmune modulator CCL21 in the thalamus , which induces microglial activation in association with pain phenomena . Key words : thalamus ; microglia ; CCL21 ; pain ; spinal cord injury ; hypersensitivity Introduction Neuroimmune alterations contribute to maladaptive changes in nociceptive processing after nervous system injury . Microglia have been implicated in the initiation phase of peripheral injury - induced pain ( Coyle , 1998 ; Fu et al . , 1999 ; Watkins et al . , 2001 , 2007 ; Jin et al . , 2003 ; Ledeboer et al . , 2005 ; DeLeo et al . , 2006 ) and become activated via local release of factors such as interleukin - 1 (cid:1) ( IL - 1 (cid:1) ) , IL - 6 , tumor necrosis factor (cid:2) ( TNF (cid:2) ) , ATP , substance P , and fractalkine ( Ji and Strichartz , 2004 ; Marc - hand et al . , 2005 ; Tsuda et al . , 2005 ; Wieseler - Frank et al . , 2005 ; Moalem and Tracey , 2006 ) . Microglia also become activated in the spinal cord after clini - cal ( Chang , 2007 ) and experimental spinal cord injury ( SCI ) ( Popovich et al . , 1997 ; Hains et al . , 2003 ; Sroga et al . , 2003 ; Nesic et al . , 2005 ; Zai and Wrathall , 2005 ; Crown et al . , 2006 ; Hains and Waxman , 2006 ; Zhao et al . , 2007 ) . The identification of unique , injury - inducedregionalstimulatorsofmicrogliawillbecriticalto our understanding , as well as management , of signaling pathways underlying chronic pain after SCI . Microglia in the lumbar dorsal horn become activated and help to maintain hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons associated with pain - related behaviors ( Hains and Waxman , 2006 ) through an extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) - regulated microglia – neuron prostaglan - din E 2 ( PGE 2 ) signaling mechanism ( Zhao et al . , 2007 ) . Dorsal horn nociceptive neurons project rostrally to third - order neurons in the ventral posterolateral ( VPL ) nucleus of the thalamus , which is involved in sensory - discriminative aspects of pain processing ( Jones 1998 ) . VPL neurons become hyperexcit - able after SCI ( Hains et al . , 2005 , 2006 ) . In this new configura - tion , spinal and thalamic somatosensory circuitry amplify and generate abnormal nociceptive impulses , which are likely inter - preted by the brain as inappropriate or excessive pain ( Yezierski 2001 ; Waxman and Hains , 2006 ) . Thalamic changes have been associated with pain after SCI in humans ( Lenz et al . , 1989 ; Pat - tany et al . , 2002 ) , primates ( Weng et al . , 2000 ) , and rats ( Gerke et al . , 2003 ; Koyama et al . , 1993 ; Hubscher and Johnson , 2006 ) , but the molecular determinants of these changes are unclear . We considered the possibility that microglia contribute to al - terations in nociceptive processing within the VPL after SCI .

Indeed , CCL21 upregulation and vesicular packaging are observed in an in vitro model of neuronal injury ( de Jong et al . , 2005 ) . In this report , we demonstrate that microglia become acti - vated in the VPL after SCI , that remote transsynaptic microglial activation contributes to neuronal hyperexcitability and pain be - haviors after SCI , and that CCL21 plays an important role in this process . Materials and Methods Animal care . Experiments were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals ; all animal protocols were approved by the Yale University Institutional AnimalCareandUseCommittee . AdultmaleSpragueDawleyrats ( 200 – 275 g ) were used for this study . Animals were housed under a 12 h light / dark cycle in a pathogen - free area with ad libitum access to water and food . Spinal cord stimulation . Unilateral electrical stimulation of the spino - thalamic tract ( STT ) was performed at spinal segment L1 in intact rats . Under pentobarbital anesthesia ( 40 mg / kg , i . p . ) , a partial laminectomy was performed , and a platinum stimulating electrode was stereotaxically inserted into the ventrolateral funiculus corresponding to the location of the STT . Stimulation was performed ( 30 V ; 0 . 5 ms pulse duration ) at 10 Hz for 8 min ( Martin et al . , 1990 ; Yen et al . , 1991 ) , which is consistent with firing rates observed after SCI during painful stimulation ( Hains et al . , 2003 ) . Animals were decapitated 20 – 25 min after stimulation , and thalamic tissue was collected for histological or enzyme immunoassay . Spinal cord injury . Rats were deeply anesthetized with ketamine / xyla - zine ( 80 / 5 mg / kg , i . p . ) . Spinal contusion injury ( SCI ) was produced at spinal segment T9 using the MASCIS / NYU impact injury device ( Gruner , 1992 ) . A 10 g , 2 . 0 mm diameter rod was released from a 25 mm height onto the exposed spinal cord . For sham surgery , animals under - wentlaminectomyandplacementintothevertebralclipsoftheimpactorwithoutimpactinjury . After SCI or sham surgery , the overlying muscles and skin were closed in layers with 4 - 0 silk sutures and staples , respec - tively , and the animal was allowed to recover on a 30°C heating pad . Postoperative treatments included saline ( 2 . 0 cc , s . c . ) for rehydration , and Baytril ( 0 . 3 cc , 22 . 7 mg / ml , s . c . ; twice daily ) to prevent urinary tract infection . Bladdersweremanuallyexpressedtwicedailyuntilreflexblad - der emptying returned , typically by 10 d after injury . After surgery , ani - mals were maintained under the same preoperative conditions , and fed ad libitum . Blockade of spinal afferent barrage to the thalamus . Four weeks after SCI , under pentobarbital anesthesia ( 40 mg / kg , i . p . ) , the spinal cord was exposed by laminectomy either rostral to the SCI site at spinal segment T1 , or caudal to the site of injury ( but rostral to the lumbar enlargement ) at spinal segment L1 . A solution of 2 % lidocaine was topically applied to the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the spinal cord followed by complete cord transection with iridectomy scissors as established previously by us ( Hains et al . , 2005 ) . Tissue was collected 10 – 16 min after cord transec - tion for histological or enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) analysis . Intra - VPL drug delivery . Under ketamine / xylazine ( 80 / 5 mg / kg , i . p . ) or halothane ( 3 % induction , 1 . 5 % maintenance by facial mask , for (cid:2) CCL21 injections ) anesthesia , rats were placed into a stereotaxic frame and bilaterally injected according to coordinates corresponding to the VPL nucleus ( bregma , (cid:1) 3 . 14 mm ; lateral , 2 . 6 mm ; vertical , 4 . 8 mm ) . Injections were performed at 4 weeks after injury for SCI rats , and at age - matched time points for non - SCI animals . In a 1 . 0 (cid:3) l total volume slowly over a period of 6 min , animals received artificial CSF ( aCSF ) ( 1 . 3 m M CaCl 2 (cid:1) 2H 2 O , 2 . 6 m M KCl , 0 . 9 m M MgCl , 21 . 0 m M NaHCO 3 , 2 . 5 m M Na 2 HPO 4 (cid:1) 7H 2 O , 125 . 0 m M NaCl , prepared in sterile H 2 O ) ( Hains and Waxman , 2006 ) , recombinant mouse CCL21 ( rmCCL21 ) ( 1 . 2 ng ; R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) ( Elzaouk et al . , 2006 ) , goat anti - mouse CCL21 neutralizing antibody ( (cid:2) CCL21 ) ( 5 ng ; R & D Systems ) ( Liu et al . , 2005 ) , affinity - purifiednormalgoatIgG ( 13ng ; R & DSystems ) ( Milligan et al . , 2005 ) , and / or minocycline ( 10 (cid:3) g ; Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) ( Lede - boer et al . , 2005 ; Hains and Waxman , 2006 ) , which potently downregu - lates the activity of microglia in vivo ( Raghavendra et al . , 2003 ; Hua et al . , 2005 ; Ledeboer et al . , 2005 ) . A separate group of intact rats underwent identical intra - VPL injections of minocycline or (cid:2) CCL21 to test for injection - induced effects on microglial activation and nociceptive thresholds . Drug doses were predetermined and verified by our group . Injection locations were assessed histologically . Immunostaining and quantification . Immunostaining was performed at 4 weeks after injury for SCI rats , and at age - matched time points for controlanimals ( n (cid:2) 4 – 7sections / 4 – 8animals / group ) . Ratsweredeeply anesthetized with ketamine / xylazine ( 80 mg / 5 kg , i . p . ) and perfused in - tracardially with 0 . 01 M PBS followed by 4 % cold , buffered paraformal - dehyde . Tissue was postfixed for 15 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde PBS and cryopreserved overnight at 4°C in 30 % sucrose PBS . Coronal cyo - sections ( 12 (cid:3) m ) corresponding to the lumbar enlargement ( L4 ) or VPL were incubated at room temperature in the following : ( 1 ) blocking solu - tion ( PBS containing 5 % NGS , 2 % BSA , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 0 . 02 % sodium azide ) for 30 min ; ( 2 ) primary antibody : mouse anti - Cd11b / c clone OX - 42 raised against complement receptor 3 ( 1 : 250 ; BD Bio - sciences , San Jose , CA ) ( Hains and Waxman , 2006 ; Zhao et al . , 2007 ) , rabbit anti - CCL21 ( 1 : 250 ; Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) , mouse anti - neuron - specificnuclearproteinNeuN ( 1 : 500 ; Millipore , Temecula , CA ) , or mouse anti - glutamate ( 1 : 1000 ; Millipore ) overnight in blocking solu - tion at 4°C ; ( 3 ) PBS , six times for 5 min each ; and ( 4 ) appropriate sec - ondary antibodies in blocking solution for 2 h ; ( 5 ) PBS , six times for 5 min each . Control experiments were performed without primary or sec - ondaryantibodies , preabsorptiontreatments ( rmCCL21 ; 50ng / ml ; R & D Systems ; in the case of anti - CCL21 ) , and blocking substances ( peptides ) obtained from manufacturers . Quantification of cellular signal intensity of digitally captured images was performed by a blinded observer using IPLab Spectrum , version 3 . 0 , software ( Scanalytics , Fairfax , VA ) . Percentage of field analysis was per - formed using MetaMorph ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) to pro - vide a quantitative estimate ( proportional area ) of changes in the activa - tion state of microglial cells ( Popovich et al . , 1997 ; Hains and Waxman , 2006 ; Zhao et al . , 2007 ) in the VPL , ventral posteromedial ( VPM ) , and reticular ( Rt ) thalamic nuclei ( (cid:3) 0 . 50 mm 2 ) based on atlas boundaries , after subtraction of background signal . Resting glia were classified as having small compact somata bearing long thin ramified processes . Ac - tivatedgliaexhibitedmarkedcellularhypertrophy , andretractionofpro - cesses such that the process length was less than the somal diameter . Backgroundlevelsofsignalweresubtracted , andcontrolandexperimen - tal conditions were evaluated in identical manners . Enzyme immunoassays . From sham - operated and animals 4 weeks af - ter SCI and / or treatment , after microdissection of spinal cord segments T9andL4 , andventrobasalthalamus , tissuelevelsofCCL21 ( Quantikine Assay ; R & D Systems ) or proinflammatory cytokines and microglial acti - vators IL - 1 (cid:1) , IL - 6 , TNF (cid:2) , fractalkine , monocyte chemoattractant pro - tein 1 ( MCP - 1 ) ( CCL2 ) , macrophage - inflammatory protein 1 (cid:2) ( MIP - 1 (cid:2) ) , and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted ( RANTES ) ( CCL5 ) ( Pierce SearchLight Multiplex Assay ; Pierce Biotech - nology , Woburn , MA ) were assayed in triplicate using quantitative en - zyme immunoassay , from the following groups : intact and sham oper - ated ( age - matched ) , SCI ( all 4 weeks post - SCI ) , SCI plus rostral block , SCI plus caudal block , side ipsilateral to STT stimulation , side contralat - eral to STT stimulation . After decapitation , thalamic tissue was rapidly microdissected , rinsedfreeofbloodwithPBS , weighed , andflash - frozen . Tissue was not pooled . Tissue was homogenized in ice - cold lysis buffer ( 0 . 1 M phosphate , pH 7 . 4 , 1 m M EDTA ) containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) using a tube pestle , followed by centrifugation at 1500 (cid:4) g for 10 min . According to the manufacturer , the CCL21 assay demonstrates little cross - reactivity be - tween structurally related MCP - 1 , MCP - 5 , MIP - 1 (cid:2) , or RANTES that mayalsoeffectmicroglialactivation .

Thalamic unit recordings . Under constant pentobarbital ( 40 mg / kg , i . p . ) anesthesia , activity from multireceptive units with hindpaw recep - tive fields responding to both innocuous and noxious inputs were re - corded from the VPL ( bregma , (cid:1) 3 . 14 ; lateral , 2 . 6 ; vertical , 4 . 8 ) from intact , SCI plus IgG , and SCI plus (cid:2) CCL21 animals by established meth - ods ( Hains et al . , 2005 , 2006 ) . Recordings were obtained 4 weeks after injury and drug delivery for SCI rats . Rectal temperature was maintained at 37°C . The head was fixed in a stereotaxicapparatus ( KopfInstruments , Tujunga , CA ) andskinincision andalimitedcraniotomyexposedthebrainsurfaceverticaltotherecord - ing sites within the thalamus . Neuronal units were isolated from the VPL ( bregma , (cid:1) 3 . 14 mm ; lateral , 2 . 6 mm ; vertical , 4 . 8 mm ) . Extracellular single - unit recordings were made with a low - impedance 5 M (cid:5) tungsten insulated microelectrode ( A - M Systems , Carlsborg , WA ) . Electrical sig - nals were amplified and filtered at 300 – 3000 Hz ( DAM80 ; World Preci - sion Instruments , Sarasota , FL ) , processed by a data collection system ( CED1401 (cid:6) ; CambridgeInstruments , Cambridge , UK ) , andstoredona computer ( Pentium 4 PC ; Dell , Austin , TX ) to construct peristimulus time histograms or wavemarks . The stored digital record of individual unit activity was analyzed off - line with Spike2 software ( version 5 . 09 ; Cambridge Electronic Design , Cambridge , UK ) . Units were only sampled if they possessed hindpaw receptive fields . Once a cell was identified , its receptive field was mapped and stimulated . Background activity was measured followed by cutaneous receptive field mappingwithvonFreyfilamentsand / orbriefpinches . Threemechanical stimuli were routinely applied : ( 1 ) phasic brush , ( 2 ) pressure ( 144 g / mm 2 force arterial clip ) , and ( 3 ) pinch ( 583 g / mm 2 force arterial clip ) . Multireceptive units were identified by their responsiveness to brush , press , and pinch . Background activity was recorded for 10 s and stimuli applied serially for 10 s , separated by 10 s of baseline activity . Care was taken to ensure that the responses were maximal , that each stimulus was applied to the primary receptive field of the unit , and that isolated units remained intact and held for the duration of each experiment using template matching routines . Neurons responding mainly to joint move - ment or to probing subcutaneous tissue were excluded from analysis . Evoked responses were calculated by subtracting the prestimulus base - line activity to yield net number of spikes per response . Units were considered to be hyperre - sponsive if evoked discharge rates were (cid:7) 150 % of control levels . At the conclusion of each ex - periment , direct current ( 1 mA for 20 s ) was passed through the recording electrode to mark the recording site . Somatosensory behavioral testing . Baseline thresholds were established before sham sur - gery or 4 weeks after SCI , and then performed aftersurgeryand / ordruginjectionat8and24h intervals . Mechanical nociceptive thresholds weredeterminedbypawwithdrawaltoapplica - tion of a series of calibrated von Frey filaments ( Stoelting , Wood Dale , IL ) to the glabrous sur - face of the hindpaws . Before testing , animals were acclimatized to the testing area for 30 min . After application of von Frey filaments ( 0 . 4 – 26 g ) with enough force to cause buckling of the filament , a modification of the up – down method of Dixon ( 1980 ) was used to determine the value at which paw withdrawal occurred 50 % of the time ( Chaplan et al . , 1994 ) , inter - preted to be the mechanical nociceptive threshold . After acclimation to the test chamber , ther - mal nociceptive thresholds were assessed by measuring the latency of paw withdrawal in re - sponse to a radiant heat source ( Dirig et al . , 1997 ) . Animals were placed in Plexiglas boxes on an elevated glass plate ( 37°C ) under which a radiantheatsource ( 5 . 14amps ) wasappliedtotheglabroussurfaceofthe pawthroughtheglassplate . Theheatsourcewasturnedoffautomatically byaphotocellonlimb - lift , allowingthemeasurementofpawwithdrawal latency . If no response was detected , the heat source was automatically shut off at 20 s . Three minutes were allowed between each trial , and four trials were averaged for each limb . Statistical analysis . Data were evaluated at an (cid:2) level of 0 . 05 by two - tailedanalyses . Within - groupmeasuresweretestedforsignificanceusing one - way ANOVA , followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc analysis . Pairwise comparisonswereperformedwitheitherthepairedStudent’s t testorthe two - sample Student’s t test . Linear relationships were assessed using Pearson’scorrelationtest . Datamanagementandstatisticalanalyseswere performed with Jandel SigmaStat ( version 1 . 0 ) and graphed using Jandel SigmaPlot ( version 7 . 0 ) as mean (cid:8) SD . Results SCI - induced microglial activation in the VPL correlates with lowered nociceptive thresholds Immunostaining with antibodies against Cd11b / c revealed the presence of microglia in the VPL ( identified in Fig . 1 a ) of both intact and SCI animals ( n (cid:2) 4 / group / time point ) . Resting micro - glia in intact animals ( Fig . 1 b ) displayed small compact somata bearing long thin ramified processes and were the predominant morphotype . After SCI , activated microglia exhibited marked cellular hypertrophy and retraction of processes , which became progressivelymorepronouncedby4weeksintheVPL ( Fig . 1 c – f ) . We observed no signs of astroglial activation in the VPL after SCI ( data not shown ) . As measured by percentage of field analysis ( n (cid:2) 4 sections / animal ) , microglial activation was not observed in the adjacent VPM nucleus ( mean , 46 . 6 (cid:8) 8 . 1 arbitrary units ) or Rt nucleus ( mean , 46 . 5 (cid:8) 7 . 9 ) after SCI ( Fig . 1 g ) . Significant microglial activation in the VPL was observed starting at 2 weeks ( 71 . 2 (cid:8) 13 . 3 ; p (cid:2) 0 . 02 ) after SCI compared with sham - operated Figure1 .

For comparison , in sham - operated animals , mechanical paw with - drawal thresholds were 22 . 7 (cid:8) 3 . 4 g . Table 1 lists the results from enzyme immunoassay of microglial activators and proinflammatory cytokines in the ventro - basal thalamus in intact animals ( n (cid:2) 8 ) , and in animals 4 weeks after T9 SCI ( n (cid:2) 9 ) . Only IL - 6 was significantly elevated in the SCI group ( 182 . 9 (cid:8) 13 . 3 pg / mg tissue ; p (cid:2) 0 . 005 ) compared with intact ( 145 . 7 (cid:8) 7 . 6 pg / mg tissue ) . Multiple locations in the spinal cord regulate CCL21 levels in the VPL after SCI A low level of CCL21 signal is present in sham - operated animals ( Fig . 2 a ) . At 4 weeks after SCI , CCL21 signal is increased in lumbar dorsal horn neurons ( Fig . 2 b ) , which is eliminated by preabsorption with CCL21 ( Fig . 2 c ) . CCL21 signal colocalizes with large diameter ( 12 (cid:3) m diameter or greater ) NeuN - positive ( Fig . 2 d , e ) ( 19 . 5 (cid:8) 3 . 9 % of NeuN - positive cells ) and glutamate - positive ( Fig . 2 f , g ) cells . At these time points , EIA analysis revealed significantly elevated dorsal horn tissue levels of CCL21 in the T9 ( 75 . 3 (cid:8) 22 . 7 pg / mg ; n (cid:2) 6 ; p (cid:2) 0 . 003 ) and L4 ( 39 . 0 (cid:8) 11 . 3 pg / mg ; n (cid:2) 6 ; p (cid:2) 0 . 001 ) segments 4 weeks after SCI , when compared with T9 ( 8 . 3 (cid:8) 3 . 5 pg / mg ) and L4 ( 12 . 3 (cid:8) 2 . 1 pg / mg ) seg - ments in sham - operated animals ( Fig . 2 h ) . In the VPL of intact animals ( Fig . 3 a ) , low levels of CCL21 signal were observed in cell bodies exhibiting neuronal mor - phologies . After SCI , an increase in CCL21 signalwasobservedintheVPLwithinneu - ronal cell bodies and parenchyma ( Fig . 3 b ) . CCl21signalremainedlowinadjacent structures such as the VPM and Rt , and the internal capsule . To ascertain whether increased tissue levels of CCL21 after SCI could be triggered by increased afferent barrage from STT neurons at the site of injury , or from the lumbar enlargement , which serves as the site of origin of a large population of nocicep - tive afferent fibers projecting to the VPL , we analyzed CCL21 levels after application of 2 % lidocaine and subsequent transec - tion of the spinal cord at T1 or L1 spinal segments ( Fig . 3 c ) . After rostral blockade at T1 ( Fig . 3 d ) , CCL21 signal was markedly re - duced in the VPL , whereas after blockade caudal to the impact site ( but rostral to the lumbar enlargement ) at L1 , CCL21 signal was only slightly reduced ( Fig . 3 e ) . Tissue levels of CCL21 in the ventrobasal complex of the thal - amus , measured by EIA ( Fig . 3 f ) , showed a significant increase in CCL21 4 weeks after SCI ( 143 . 3 (cid:8) 32 . 6 pg / mg tissue ; n (cid:2) 9 ; p (cid:2) 0 . 001 ) compared with intact animals ( 6 . 7 (cid:8) 6 . 9 pg / mg ; n (cid:2) 8 ) .

Effect of STT stimulation on CCL21 levels in the thalamus To determine whether high - frequency stimulation of the STT can induce an increase in CCL21 within the thalamus after SCI , we performed supramaximal electrical stimulation of the STT in intact animals ( n (cid:2) 8 ) ( Fig . 4 ) . The frequency was equivalent to the firing frequency of STT units measured after SCI ( Hains et al . , 2003 ) . Unilateral STT stimulation at L1 resulted in a significant increase in thalamic levels of CCL21 on the ipsilateral side ( 86 . 6 (cid:8) 13 . 5 pg / mg tissue ; p (cid:2) 0 . 003 ) as measured by enzyme immunoassay ( n (cid:2) 4 ) 20 – 25 min after stimulation . Contralateral levels ( 10 . 2 (cid:8) 2 . 0 pg / mg ) were not different from levels observed in intact animals ( Fig . 3 f ) . Intra - VPL injection of CCL21 transiently induces microglial activation and pain - related behaviors Direct injections of rmCCL21 into the VPL of intact animals ( n (cid:2) 4 animals / time point ) ( Fig . 5 a ) led to activation of local micro - glia . Representative images from an intact animal ( Fig . 5 b ) im - munostained for Cd11b / c show typical resting morphologies . In contrast , as soon as 4 h after CCL21 injection ( Fig . 5 c ) , microglia exhibited morphologies consistent with the early phases of acti - vation , whereby somal compartments began to hypertrophy , and secondary and tertiary cellular process retracted . Morphological activation peaked at 8 h after injection ( Fig . 5 f ) , and by 48 h returned to baseline activation status ( Fig . 5 i ) . Analysis of per - centage of Cd11b / c field area revealed significant increases in activation after rmCCL21 injection compared with aCSF vehicle ( mean , 49 . 7 (cid:8) 9 . 8 arbitrary units ) at the 4 h ( 89 . 3 (cid:8) 16 . 1 ; p (cid:2) 0 . 002 ) , 8 h ( 96 . 9 (cid:8) 22 . 9 ; p (cid:2) 0 . 001 ) , 12 h ( 77 . 8 (cid:8) 12 . 5 ; p (cid:2) 0 . 002 ) , and 24 h ( 74 . 5 (cid:8) 15 . 5 ; p (cid:2) 0 . 005 ) time points ( Fig . 5 j ) . In a separate experiment , at 8 h after injection of vehicle , rmCCL21 , or rmCCL21 plus minocycline ( n (cid:2) 8 animals / group ) , mechan - ical and thermal nociceptive thresholds were tested ( Fig . 5 k ) . Paw withdrawal thresholds to stimulation of the glabrous surface of the paw with a graded series of calibrated von Frey filaments were unchanged in animals receiving injections of vehicle ( 21 . 3 (cid:8) 1 . 5 g ) , which were equivalent to intact animals ( 22 . 7 (cid:8) 2 . 3 g ) ( data not shown ) . In contrast , mechanical thresholds in animals receiving rmCCL21 were significantly decreased ( 2 . 7 (cid:8) 0 . 9 g ; p (cid:2) 0 . 001 ) compared with vehicle , implicating CCL21 in the devel - opment of mechanical allodynia . The pronociceptive effects of rmCCL21 were prevented by simultaneous delivery of the micro - glial inhibitor minocycline ( 18 . 6 (cid:8) 2 . 4 g ) . Paw withdrawal laten - cies to thermal stimulation of the hindpaw with a radiant heat source did not reveal a change in vehicle - injected animals ( 9 . 8 (cid:8) 1 . 3 s ; equivalent to 42 . 1°C ) compared with intact animals ( 10 . 3 (cid:8) 1 . 9 s ; 42 . 6°C ) ( data not shown ) . rmCCL21 injections , however , resulted in significantly reduced paw withdrawal latencies to thermal stimulation ( 4 . 4 (cid:8) 1 . 2 s ; 38 . 2°C ; p (cid:2) 0 . 006 ) , compared with vehicle . Reductions in withdrawal latency caused by rm - CCL21 were blocked with minocycline ( 9 . 1 (cid:8) 1 . 9 s ) . Neutralization of CCL21 abrogates post - SCI microglial activation , neuronal hyperexcitability , and pain behaviors To evaluate the effects of selective inhibition of CCL21 in SCI animals , we directly injected a neutralizing antibody generated against CCL21 ( (cid:2) CCL21 ) bilaterally into the VPL at 4 weeks after injury ( i . e . , at a time when microglial activation in the VPL was robust and correlated to reductions in behavioral nociceptive thresholds ) . Microglial activation was evaluated at 8 h ( n (cid:2) 4 animals ) and 24 h ( n (cid:2) 4 animals ) after injection based on be - havioral analysis of pain thresholds , which revealed increases in nociceptivethresholdsafter (cid:2) CCL21injection , thatpeakedat8h . Control IgG injections had no effect on microglial activation 8 h after administration ( Fig . 6 a ) . Eight hours after infusion of (cid:2) CCL21 , Cd11b / cstainingshowedmicrogliathatpredominantly exhibited a resting morphotype ( Fig . 6 b ) . At 24 h post - (cid:2) CCL21 , microglia demonstrated a combination of resting and activated states ( Fig . 6 c ) . Percentage of field area analysis for Cd11b / c showed a significant microglial deactivation at 8 h ( 44 . 8 (cid:8) 8 . 0 arbitrary units ; p (cid:2) 0 . 003 ) in animals that received (cid:2) CCL21 com - pared with IgG ( 80 . 6 (cid:8) 5 . 9 ) . At the 24 h time point , Cd11b / c field area remained significantly reduced for animals receiving (cid:2) CCL21 ( 53 . 7 (cid:8) 9 . 4 ; p (cid:2) 0 . 006 ) compared with IgG ( 77 . 4 (cid:8) 7 . 5 ) . Although we did not achieve the statistical power to demonstrate a significant increase in Cd11b / c field area between the 8 and 24 h time points for (cid:2) CCL21 , there was a trend toward significance . In intact animals , intra - VPL injections of (cid:2) CCL21 did not result in changes in microglial activation status at the 8 h ( 29 . 1 (cid:8) 5 . 1 ) or 24 h ( 32 . 4 (cid:8) 5 . 3 ) time points . Selective inhibition of activated microglia with intra - VPL injection of minocycline ( n (cid:2) 4 ) also significantly reduced Cd11b / c field area at 8 h ( 15 . 9 (cid:8) 10 . 4 ; p (cid:2) 0 . 009 ) and 24 h ( 39 . 4 (cid:8) 15 . 8 ; p (cid:2) 0 . 01 ) compared with vehicle , with a trend toward a decreased effect at the 24 h time point ( Fig . 6 d ) . In intact animals , intra - VPL injections of minocycline did not result in changes in microglial activation at the 8 h ( 24 . 3 (cid:8) 3 . 4 ) or 24 h ( 23 . 0 (cid:8) 5 . 2 ) time points . SCI resulted in the development of hyperexcitability and sen - sitization of VPL neurons as shown previously . Extracellular unit recordings obtained from multireceptive VPL units ( Fig . 6 e ) in intact animals ( n (cid:2) 4 animals , 4 U / animal ) showed low evoked discharge rates in response to stimulation of identified peripheral receptive fields in the hindpaw . Phasic brush ( PB ) stimulation resulted in a mean discharge rate of 32 . 8 (cid:8) 2 . 9 Hz , compressive press ( PR ) resulted in a mean firing rate of 21 . 1 (cid:8) 2 . 3 Hz , and compressive pinch ( PI ) , 24 . 2 (cid:8) 1 . 6 Hz . After SCI and IgG injec - tion ( n (cid:2) 4 animals , 4 – 6 U / animal ) , evoked discharge rates re - mained elevated ( between 90 and 300 % ) to all three natural stim - uli , PB ( 47 . 8 (cid:8) 3 . 9 Hz ) , PR ( 42 . 5 (cid:8) 3 . 5 Hz ) , and PI ( 57 . 3 (cid:8) 3 . 6 Hz ) , levels consistent with previous reports of post - SCI thalamic Figure4 .

Intra - VPL injection of (cid:2) CCL21 ( n (cid:2) 4 animals , 4 – 6 U / animal ) attenuated the evoked hyperex - citability and resulted in significantly decreased firing rates to BR ( 36 . 3 (cid:8) 2 . 1 Hz ; p (cid:2) 0 . 04 ) , PR ( 24 . 6 (cid:8) 2 . 5 Hz ; p (cid:2) 0 . 02 ) , and PI ( 31 . 4 (cid:8) 2 . 4 Hz ; p (cid:2) 0 . 007 ) at the 8 h time point compared with IgG ( Fig . 6 f ) . (cid:2) CCL21 did not have an appreciable effect on the rate of spontaneous background ( or possibly burst ) firing com - pared with SCI animals , which is required to occur above a cer - tain rate . Our data do not permit us to draw conclusions regard - ing the relationship of CCL21 levels to the discharge rate of VPL units . After SCI , mechanical and thermal nociceptive thresholds in response to hindpaw receptive field stimulation with von Frey filaments or radiant thermal stimulus were decreased ( n (cid:2) 6 – 8 animals / group ) . Mechanical thresholds ( Fig . 6 g ) were signifi - cantly reduced ( mean , 3 . 1 (cid:8) 1 . 9 g ; p (cid:2) 0 . 006 ) compared with intact animals ( 21 . 2 (cid:8) 1 . 6 g ) . By 4 h after injection ( data not shown ) , (cid:2) CCL21 resulted in a partial restoration of mechanical thresholds , whichpeakedat8h ( 11 . 0 (cid:8) 2 . 9g ; p (cid:2) 0 . 01 ) compared withIgGcontrol , butby24hthresholdshadreturnedtoallodynic levels ( 2 . 6 (cid:8) 0 . 7 g ) , and were not different from IgG ( 3 . 3 (cid:8) 1 . 2 g ) . IgG injection did not alter mechanical thresholds ( mean , 4 . 7 (cid:8) 1 . 3 g ) . Mechanical nociceptive thresholds were unchanged in in - tact animals that received intra - VPL injections of minocycline or (cid:2) CCL21 at 8 h ( 20 . 1 (cid:8) 1 . 2 and 21 . 3 (cid:8) 1 . 6 g , respectively ) , or 24 h ( 22 . 8 (cid:8) 2 . 7 and 21 . 8 (cid:8) 2 . 6 g , respectively ) , compared with base - line ( 21 . 3 (cid:8) 1 . 2 and 22 . 9 (cid:8) 1 . 3 g , respectively ) . Paw withdrawal latencies to thermal stimulation ( Fig . 6 h ) were significantly de - creased after SCI [ mean , 4 . 5 (cid:8) 1 . 0 s ( i . e . , withdrawal at 38 . 0°C ) ; p (cid:2) 0 . 001 ] compared with intact animals ( 11 . 5 (cid:8) 1 . 8 s ; with - drawal at 43 . 2°C ) . A significant increase in thermal threshold was observed at 4 h after injection of (cid:2) CCL21 . At the 8 h time point , the peak increase in thermal threshold was achieved with (cid:2) CCL21 ( 9 . 2 (cid:8) 1 . 5 s ; p (cid:2) 0 . 003 vs IgG ) . By 24 h after injection , latencies for the (cid:2) CCL2 group returned to hyperalgesic levels ( 5 . 5 (cid:8) 1 . 3 s ) that were not different from IgG - treated SCI ani - mals , which was not altered ( mean , 4 . 7 (cid:8) 1 . 2 s ) . Similarly , mino - cycline resulted in a partial restoration of mechanical ( 15 . 9 (cid:8) 2 . 5 g ; p (cid:2) 0 . 007 ) and thermal thresholds ( 10 . 2 (cid:8) 1 . 8 s ; p (cid:2) 0 . 001 ) after SCI compared with vehicle . Thermal nociceptive thresholds were unchanged in intact animals that received intra - VPL injec - tions of minocycline or (cid:2) CCL21 at 8 h ( 11 . 4 (cid:8) 1 . 2 s , 43 . 4°C , and 10 . 9 (cid:8) 1 . 8 s , 43 . 2°C , respectively ) , or 24 h ( 12 . 6 (cid:8) 1 . 9 s , 43 . 8°C , and 11 . 7 (cid:8) 1 . 8 s , 43 . 5°C , respectively ) , compared with baseline ( 12 . 0 (cid:8) 1 . 4 s , 43 . 6°C , and 12 . 8 (cid:8) 1 . 2 s , 43 . 8°C , respectively ) . Discussion SCI leads to changes in excitability of VPL neurons that contrib - ute to neuronal hyperexcitability and chronic pain ( Lenz et al . , 1989 ; Weng et al . , 2000 ; Gerke et al . , 2003 ; Hains et al . , 2005 , 2006 ; Hubscher and Johnson , 2006 ) .

The thalamus is critical in this regard because resultant pathological firing ( Hains et al . , 2006 ) more potently activates cortical circuits involved in pain percep - tion through an increased gain at the thalamocortical synapse ( Swadlow and Gusev , 2001 ) . The current study builds on these findings and sheds light on mechanisms underlying the reconfiguration of thalamic nocicep - tive processing . Our results demonstrate a previously unde - scribed role for thalamic microglia in post - SCI pain , and provide evidence for remote microglial activation in the thalamus by the chemokine CCL21 . CCL21 potently activates resident microglia within the VPL , which in turn pathologically modulate thalamic nociceptive neurons . Microglial activation in the VPL occurs over the course of several weeks after SCI . However , it is not known whether this correlates with the onset of allodynia and / or hyperalgesia , be - cause before the 4 week time point reliable somatosensory testing is not possible because of slowly resolving locomotor deficits that preclude testing of nociceptive thresholds . It is possible that mi - croglial activation in the VPL is a consequence of spinal hyperex - citability . Alternatively , it may be an autonomous process that is initiated by the injury itself ( thus injury dependent ) . As suggested previously by us ( Hains and Waxman , 2006 ) , in the case of cen - tral injuries such as SCI , microglial reactivity may differ in mech - anism , location , and influence , when compared with peripheral nerve injury where microglial activation is implicated in the ini - tiation phase of pain ( Raghavendra et al . , 2003 ; Hua et al . , 2005 ; Ledeboer et al . , 2005 ) . Chemokines activate receptors on macrophages and micro - glia to trigger migration and activation ( White et al . , 2005b ; Watkins et al . , 2007 ) . CCL21 elicits a chemotaxic response by microglia but not monocytes or neutrophils ( Gunn et al . , 1999 ) , which can be disrupted in CCL21 receptor knock - out mice ( Rap - pert et al . , 2004 ) . Diffusible CCL21 binds and activates the CCR7 and CXCR3 receptors expressed by microglia ( Soto et al . , 1998 ; Biber et al . , 2002 ; Rappert et al . , 2002 ; Dijkstra et al . , 2006 ) . Mi - crogliaactivatedbyLPSstimulation invitro ( Dijkstraetal . , 2006 ) , in multiple sclerosis lesions ( Serafini et al . , 2006 ) , and in models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis during symp - tom onset and progression ( Columba - Cabezas et al . , 2003 ; Dijk - stra et al . , 2006 ) , have been shown to upregulate the CCR7 recep - tor . MicrogliaalsorespondtoCCL21vialower - affinityactivation of the CXCR3 receptor ( Murphy et al . , 2000 ; Biber et al . , 2001 ; Rappert et al . , 2002 ; Dijkstra et al . , 2004 ) . CXCR3 is also ex - pressed by astrocytes and neurons ; however , CCL21 is not a func - tional ligand for CXCR3 in these cells ( Biber et al . , 2002 ; de Jong et al . , 2005 ) . Given the antigen - presenting capabilities of micro - glia , expression of these two CCL21 receptors may differ depend - ing on stimuli present in the local microenvironment and / or in - jury state ( Dijkstra et al . , 2006 ) . Future work should examine microglial CCL21 receptor populations in naive conditions , after peripheral or central injury , and in association with acute or chronic pain in different nociceptive structures . There are several possibilities regarding the source of thalamic CCL21 : CCL21 released from presynaptic ( putative STT ) termi - nals , and / or intrinsic VPL cells . In the first case , CCL21 could be synthesized by nociceptive neurons and by other cells in response to injury ( White et al . , 2005b ) . After SCI , CCL21 could be up - regulated in the cell bodies of damaged STT neurons , and then transported the VPL . This is predicted by in vitro studies showing that neurons exposed to high concentrations of glutamate [ which occurs surrounding the SCI epicenter ( McAdoo et al . , 1999 ) ] rapidly express and release the chemokine CCL21 , and that this CCL21 is packed in vesicles and transported throughout neuro - Figure6 .

Zhaoetal . • ThalamicModulationofPainbyMicrogliaafterSCI J . Neurosci . , August15 , 2007 • 27 ( 33 ) : 8893 – 8902 • 8899 nal processes to reach presynaptic structures ( de Jong et al . , 2005 ) . This possibility is supported by our data showing in - creased CCL21 signal in excitatory neurons of the dorsal horn , and in spinal parenchyma at both the T9 and L4 spinal segments after SCI ; however , it is not possible to know in our model whether vesicular packaging and transport occurs . Interruption of the spinal afferent barrage at several sites after SCI reduced CCL21 levels in the VPL , with the degree of reduction depending on the location of the spinal block , suggesting that activity within multiple spinal sites can influence CCL21 levels in the VPL , but to different degrees . The rapidity of the reduction in thalamic levels of CCL21 after cord blockade suggests that the spinal cord either directly or indirectly can modulate CCL21 levels . Alternate expla - nations for this finding are ( 1 ) that spinal transection produces a massive barrage of activation in VPL resulting in the local release and degradation of CCL21 causing the decrease in CCL21 as measured by EIA and immunostaining , and / or ( 2 ) that rostrally applied lidocaine diffuses through the ventricular system to the VPL , penetrates into the VPL , and effects CCL21 release , al - though studies of CSF flow dynamics and drug movement make this possibility unlikely ( Bernards , 1999 ) . Whether events occur - ring at the site of injury ( T9 ) or lumbar enlargement ( L3 – L5 ) contribute differentially to thalamic microglial activation is not known , but our data suggest that the influence is additive . It is possible that the site of injury may exert a greater influence be - cause en passant STT axons may be damaged by injury - induced events or by intermingling of damaged at - level STT fibers . More - over , intrathalamic microinjection of CCL21 neutralizing anti - bodies or the microglial inhibitor minocycline only transiently deactivated microglia ( and reversed neuronal hyperexcitability and pain - related behaviors ) , implicating a persistent activating drive . In the second case , because electrical stimulation of the STT in intact animals resulted in a rapid increase in CCL21 levels in the thalamus ( which would preclude vesicular packaging and trans - port along the STT ) , and because CCL21 levels were not com - pletelyabolishedbycordtransectionrostraltoboththeinjurysiteandlumbarenlargementafterSCI , it is likely that intrinsic neu - rons of the VPL produce at least some CCL21 . CCL21 signal was observed in cells exhibiting neuronal morphologies within the VPL after injury . An alternate explanation is that some CCL21 remained in presynaptic structures after cord transection . It cannot be determined whether CCL21 is released locally by these neurons , possibly as a result of STT stimulation , and / or whether CCL21 is being recycled by these neurons after release from pre - synaptic structures . Given our data , we hypothesize that increases in thalamic CCL21 after SCI might be dependent on both spinal and local factors , but future experiments should address these issues . Regardless of the source of the CCL21 increase in the thala - mus , our data identify a new neuron – microglia signaling mech - anism by which microglia can be activated in the context of ner - vous system injuries that produce pain . Thus far , fractalkine and MCP - 1 signaling mechanisms have been implicated in the initi - ation of pain . The chemokine fractalkine [ CX3CL1 ( C - X3 - C mo - tif ligand 1 ) ] is expressed in sensory afferents and intrinsic spinal cord neurons , and its receptor ( CX3CR1 ) is expressed primarily by microglia ( Verge et al . , 2004 ) . Fractalkine is a potent modula - tor that activates microglia after peripheral nerve injury and con - tributes to the induction phase of pain in the spinal cord ( Milli - gan et al . , 2004 ) . MCP - 1 ( CCL2 ) is upregulated in damaged dorsal root ganglion neurons ( White et al . , 2005a ) , and can be transported to sensory terminals in the spinal cord where it acti - vates microglia ( Zhang and De Koninck , 2006 ) . Through bio - chemical analysis , we did not observe elevations in fractalkine or MCP - 1 levels within the ventrobasal thalamus of animal exhibit - ing chronic pain VPL at a time when microglia were activated . Nor did we measure increases in the potential microglial activa - tors RANTES ( CCL5 ) or MIP - 1 (cid:2) . After SCI , levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL - 6 were elevatedinthethalamus . ThepreciseroleofIL - 6inthiscaseisnot known , however , given that IL - 6 possesses a dual role as a micro - glial activator as well as a neuromodulator ( produced by micro - glia ) ( Milligan et al . , 2005 ; Schoeniger - Skinner et al . , 2007 ) . That IL - 1 (cid:1) and TNF (cid:2) , which have been implicated in microglia – neu - ron pain signaling ( Milligan et al . , 2001 ; Ledeboer et al . , 2005 ) , were not significantly elevated in the thalamus after SCI does not lessen the potential influence of microglia on neuronal excitabil - ity . It is possible that microglia signal neurons through different cytokines at acute and chronic time points after SCI , and at loca - tions distant to the site of injury . We have recently shown that after SCI microglia use PGE 2 as a microglia – neuron signaling molecule , which is regulated by pERK1 / 2 , to induce hyperexcit - ability of lumbar dorsal horn neurons ( Zhao et al . , 2007 ) . PGE 2 may also act as a microglia – neuron signal in the VPL as well . In summary , these experiments identify a mechanism whereby SCI triggers a remote secondary pathology in the VPL that specifically contributes to the persistent amplification of ab - normal nociceptive signals and chronic pain .
