Opinion The Diverse Family of Arp2 / 3 Complexes Javier Pizarro - Cerdá , 1 , 2 , 3 , * Dror Shlomo Chorev , 4 , 5 Benjamin Geiger , 4 and Pascale Cossart 1 , 2 , 3 , * The Arp2 / 3 complex has so far been considered to be a single seven - subunit protein complex required for actin nucleation and actin ﬁ lament polymerization in diverse critical cellular functions including phagocytosis , vesicular traf ﬁ cking and lamellipodia extension . The Arp2 / 3 complex is also exploited by bacterial pathogens and viruses during cellular infectious processes . Recent studies suggest that some subunits of the complex are dispensable in speci ﬁ c cellular contexts , pointing to the existence of alternative ‘ hybrid Arp2 / 3 complexes ’ containing other components such as vinculin or a - actinin , as well as different isoforms or phosphorylation variants of canonical Arp2 / 3 subunits . Therefore , this diversity should be now considered when assigning speci ﬁ c Arp2 / 3 assem - blies to different actin - dependent cellular processes . Introduction The actin cytoskeleton is a main component of eukaryotic cells , that not only provides the molecular basis for cellular morphogenesis and migration , but also participates dynamically in mechanical resistance to deformation , uptake of extracellular material , intracellular vesicular transport and cell adhesion . The actin cytoskeleton also participates in the organization of complex cellular structures such as ﬁ lopodia , lamellipodia and podosomes [ 1 , 2 ] . Polymerization of actin monomers into actin ﬁ laments requires the activity of cellular actin nucleators . The Arp2 / 3 complex , the ﬁ rst nucleator identi ﬁ ed in eukaryotic cells , plays a central role in many cellular processes and is highly conserved from trypanosomes to the ﬁ ssion yeast and humans [ 3 – 5 ] . Other nucleators include formins , Spire , Cordon - bleu ( COBL ) and Leiomo - dins [ 6 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex is composed of seven subunits [ 7 ] and it has been traditionally considered as a single entity , associated with the vast majority of cellular processes in which its function is required and has been studied . Recent studies [ 8 – 10 ] in the same mammalian cell system reveal that diverse Arp2 / 3 complexes may regulate different cellular and pathogen - associated func - tions , raising the possibility that Arp2 / 3 complex compositions may have been overlooked , and paving the way for the identi ﬁ cation of novel complexes associated to different actin polymeri - zation - mediated processes . Discovery and Functions of the Classical Arp2 / 3 Complex The Arp2 / 3 complex was ﬁ rst isolated from Acanthamoeba castellanii during a search for ligands of the actin - binding protein pro ﬁ lin [ 11 ] . It contained seven proteins : the actin - related proteins Arp2 ( 44 - kD ) and Arp3 ( 47 - kD ) considered as ‘ unconventional actins ’ , together with a 40 kD protein similar to a WD40 b - propeller protein from Dictyostelium discoideum , and four additional proteins of 35 kD , 19 kD , 18 kD and 13 kD [ 11 ] . Subsequently , the Arp2 / 3 complex was also identi ﬁ ed and associated with actin - rich structures in the ﬁ ssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces Trends Massspectrometry analysis ofproteins extracted from focal adhesions identi - ﬁ ed two Arp2 / 3 hybrid complexes : the ﬁ rst is composed of Arp2 , Arp3 , ARPC2 and ARPC3 together with vin - culin ; thesecondiscomposed ofArp2 , Arp3 , ARPC2 and vinculin together with / - actinin . Functional studies of Arp2 / 3 complex subunits during Listeria monocyto - genes cell invasion and actin - based motility suggest that diverse com - plexes participate at each infection stage . The subunit ARPC1B is predo - minantly required forcellular entrywhile the subunit ARPC1A is predominantly required for intracellular actin polymer - ization . Moreover , the subunit ARPC5 is dispensable for both processes . Arp2 / 3 complexes containing the sub - units ARPC1B and ARPC5B are more ef ﬁ cient at promoting actin assembly by vaccinia virus than complexes con - taining ARPC1A and ARPC5A subunits . Post - translational modi ﬁ cations of dif - ferent subunits affect the ef ﬁ ciency of Arp2 / 3 complex activity . Phosphoryla - tion of Arp2 and ARPC1B enhances actin nucleation , while phosphorylation of Arp3 attenuates it . 1 Institut Pasteur , Unité des Interactions Bactéries Cellules , Paris F - 75015 , France 2 INSERM , U604 , Paris F - 75015 , France 3 INRA , USC2020 , Paris F - 75015 , France 4 The Weizmann Institute of Science , Department of Molecular Cell Biology , Rehovot 761001 , Israel 5 Department of Chemistry , University of Oxford , Physical and Theoretical TICB 1271 No . of Pages 8 Trends in Cell Biology , Month Year , Vol . xx , No . yy http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . tcb . 2016 . 08 . 001 1 © 2016 Elsevier Ltd .

In human cells , the Arp2 / 3 complex consists of Arp2 and Arp3 , together with the Arp complex subunits ARPC1 , ARPC2 , ARPC3 , ARPC4 and ARPC5 [ 14 ] . While consensus exists concerning the Arp2 and Arp3 nomenclature , different names have been used in the literature concerning other Arp2 / 3 complex subunits : a nomenclature update across species is presented in Table 1 . The function of the Arp2 / 3 complex was shown for the ﬁ rst time to be critical in triggering actin polymerization when it was isolated from a subcellular fraction of human platelets that sustained actin assembly by the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes ( see Glossary ) [ 15 ] . The L . monocytogenes surface protein ActA activates the Arp2 / 3 complex to initiate actin polymeriza - tion , and was the ﬁ rst actin nucleation promoting factor ( NPF ) to be identi ﬁ ed [ 16 , 17 ] . Several mammalian NPFs were subsequently identi ﬁ ed , including WASP [ 18 ] , N - WASP [ 19 ] , and Scar / WAVE [ 20 ] ( see Box 1 ) . The puri ﬁ ed A . castellanii Arp2 / 3 complex was shown to nucleate the formation of actin ﬁ laments at 70 8 from other ﬁ laments [ 21 ] . A series of elegant microscopy and biochemistry investigations then de ﬁ nitively established the key role of Arp2 / 3 in actin polymeri - zation and the formation of branched structures [ 21 – 23 ] ( see Box 2 ) . As mentioned above , the function of the Arp2 / 3 complex is subverted by bacterial pathogens at different stages of their infectious processes [ 24 ] . The Gram - positive pathogen L . monocyto - genes uses Arp2 / 3 not only to mediate intracellular and intercellular movements but also to trigger cellular invasion [ 25 – 27 ] . The Gram - negative pathogen Shigella ﬂ exneri also requires Arp2 / 3 function for actin - based motility [ 28 ] and for bacterial internalization within host cells [ 29 ] . Interestingly , S . ﬂ exneri does not express an ActA - like protein but instead recruits on its surface , via the protein IcsA / VirG , the NPF N - WASP which in turn activates Arp2 / 3 to mediate actin - based motility [ 28 , 30 ] . The Gram - negative bacteria Rickettsia conorii and Rickettsia parkerii activate Arp2 / 3 during early stages of bacterial intracellular motility via a protein called RickA [ 31 – 33 ] . Moreover , R . conorii and R . parkerii require Arp2 / 3 activity to invade diverse host cells [ 34 , 35 ] . Vaccinia virus is able to move at the surface of cells on actin - based structures that resembles pedestals [ 36 ] , which requires the function of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 37 ] . Other bacteria including Mycobacterium marinum [ 38 ] and Burkholderia thailandensis also move via an actin - based motility requiring Arp2 / 3 functions [ 39 – 42 ] . In S . pombe and S . cerevisiae , deletions of genes encoding each of the subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex cause severe growth defects or lethality [ 43 , 44 ] , suggesting a major role for all subunits in vivo . In particular , Arp2 / 3 had been shown to be important for the formation and function of cortical actin patches where clathrin - mediated endocytosis takes place [ 13 ] . Mammalian Arp2 / 3 complex was localized to regions of lamellipodial protrusion [ 14 , 45 ] and together with co ﬁ lin and other actin - binding proteins , was shown to control the organization and treadmilling of actin ﬁ laments in lamellipodia [ 22 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex has been associated to other cellular functions requiring actin polymerization including phagocytosis [ 46 ] , traf ﬁ cking within and from the Golgi apparatus [ 47 ] as well as formation of focal adhesions [ 48 ] . The critical role of Arp2 / 3 in humans is highlighted by the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) , a recessive X - linked genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the WAS protein ( WASP ) , which is characterized by defects in the actin - rich immunological synapse between T cells and antigen presenting cells , leading to severe defects in immunological responses [ 49 , 50 ] . Initial cryo - electron microscopy [ 51 ] , X - ray crystallography [ 52 ] and biochemical reconstitution [ 53 ] studies identi ﬁ ed major roles played by each subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex , which have been complemented by electron tomography of the branch junction [ 54 ] . Arp2 and Arp3 are folded like actin and form the ﬁ rst two subunits of the daughter ﬁ lament [ 51 , 52 ] . A dimer of ARPC2 and ARPC4 forms the structural backbone of the complex [ 52 , 54 ] which provides the main surface for interaction of the complex with the mother actin ﬁ lament [ 53 ] .

The protein network associated to integrin receptor that bridges between the extracellular matrix and the termini of actin stress ﬁ bers is called ‘ the adhesome ’ . Listeria monocytogenes : a Gram - positive bacterium responsible for a food - borne disease named listeriosis , which can lead to meningitis in newborns and abortions in pregnant women . L . monocytogenes is the prototype intracellular pathogen , inducing its internalization within nonphagocytic cells , lysing its phagosome and using an actin - based motility system to promote cell - to - cell spread . Nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) : factors that activate the Arp2 / 3 complex to polymerize actin above the basal nucleation rate threshold displayed by the native complex . The activities of the NPFs are regulated by signal transduction pathways that coordinate actin cytoskeleton polymerization in time and space . Vaccinia virus : a prototypic poxvirus closely related to variola virus , the causative agent of smallpox . Poxviruses are enveloped DNA viruses that have the particular ability to exist in two infectious forms : mature virions are viral particles contained within a single membrane , while extracellular virions are contained within two concentric membranes . Vaccinia virus particles are propelled on the tip of actin tails at the surface of infected host cells . proposed to form a bridge between Arp3 and the mother actin ﬁ lament [ 54 ] and increases the ef ﬁ ciency of nucleation [ 53 ] , but complexes lacking ARPC3 display minor functional defects [ 44 , 53 ] . While ARPC1 is supposed to make only minor contacts with the mother actin ﬁ lament [ 54 ] , complexes lacking this subunit are far less effective in actin nucleation , suggesting additional roles for ARPC1 including binding of NPFs [ 55 ] . ARPC5 was proposed to tether Arp2 to the rest of the complex [ 54 ] . Several reports also suggest a functional role played by phosphorylation of different subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex . ARPC1 phosphorylation by p21 - activated kinase ( Pak1 ) was reported to be crucial for mammalian cell motility [ 56 ] . It has been suggested that Arp2 phosphorylation is required and critical for Arp2 / 3 complex binding to the pointed end of actin ﬁ laments and actin nucleation in cultured Drosophila cells [ 57 ] , but mutation of the phosphorylated residues had only subtle effects on motility in Dictyostelium [ 58 ] . As shown recently , phosphorylation of Arp3 by the Legionella pneumophila kinase LegK2 inhibits actin polymerization at the surface of bacterial - containing phagosomes [ 59 ] . Several subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( i . e . Arp3 , ARPC1 and ARPC5 ) display more than one isoform [ 14 ] , but the functional signi ﬁ cance of these variants has not been investigated in detail . While the major subunit Arp3 is detected in all tissues , a gene encoding the isoform ARP3 b has been detected predominantly in brain neuronal cells and was proposed to play a role in the development and / or maintenance of nerve cells [ 60 ] . Two variants of ARPC1 presenting 70 % homology had been known for long [ 12 , 45 ] and a mutation in the gene ARPC1A was shown to impact cell migration and invasion in pancreatic cancer [ 61 ] . ARPC5 was also found to display a second isoform , named ARPC5B , [ 8 _ TD $ DIFF ] expressed [ 9 _ TD $ DIFF ] constitutively in many tissues but with the highest levels in the brain , while the original ARPC5A was found highly enriched in the spleen and thymus [ 62 ] . Diversity of Arp2 / 3 Complexes Focal Adhesions Association of the Arp2 / 3 complex to focal adhesions in human skin cells had previously been shown to require interactions with vinculin [ 48 ] . A recent native mass spectrometry analysis of proteins extracted from the dense plaques ( focal adhesion homologous structures ) of chicken smooth muscle detected Arp2 / 3 complexes consisting of a core composed of Arp2 , Arp3 and ARPC2 , together with / - actinin and vinculin , or Arp2 , Arp3 , ARPC2 , ARPC3 and vinculin , that is , ‘ hybrid complexes ’ [ 8 ] . This study therefore supported , for the ﬁ rst time , the notion that alternative Arp2 / 3 complexes that do not consist of the seven classical subunits are involved in speci ﬁ c cellular processes . Notably , these alternative complexes contain vinculin , which can mediate the recruitment of the complex to focal adhesions and compete with ARPC1B in HeLa cells . Accordingly , knock - down of ARPC1B had a positive effect on focal adhesion and stress ﬁ ber formation , in line with an equilibrium shifted towards formation of Arp2 / 3 - vinculin hybrid complexes [ 8 ] . Listeria monocytogenes Infection [ 10 _ TD $ DIFF ] L . monocytogenes , as mentioned above , uses the Arp2 / 3 complex for entry into cells and for actin - based motility . Speci ﬁ c roles for ARPC1A and ARPC1B were recently identi ﬁ ed in human genome - wide RNA interference ( RNAi ) screens investigating HeLa cell infection by L . mono - cytogenes [ 9 ] . Knockdown of ARPC1B but not of ARPC1A signi ﬁ cantly diminished bacterial entry , while inactivation of ARPC1A had a more profound impact on actin tail formation than inactivation of ARPC1B . The use of small interfering RNAs targeting the subunits ARPC5A ( the product of the ARPC5 gene ) and ARPC5B ( the product of the ARPC5L gene ) did not alter bacterial entry nor actin tail formation , suggesting that the ARPC5 subunits are dispensable for both cellular processes . ArpC4 was also shown to be dispensable for L . monocytogenes early Trends in Cell Biology , Month Year , Vol . xx , No . yy 3 T I CB 1271 N o . o f P a g e s 8 Table 1 .

Vaccinia Virus Mobility In a recent study of actin polymerization by vaccinia virus , speci ﬁ c roles for ARPC1B and ARPC5B have been found [ 10 ] . Indeed , it has been observed that Arp2 / 3 complexes containing ARPC1B and ARPC5B are signi ﬁ cantly more ef ﬁ cient at promoting actin assembly than those containing ARPC1A and ARPC5A . Interestingly , actin networks induced by complexes containing the subunits ARPC1B and ARPC5B were found more stable since in the presence of these speci ﬁ c subunits , cortactin stabilizes the Arp2 / 3 complexes against coronin - mediated disassembly [ 10 ] . Overall , these [ 52 _ TD $ DIFF ] three reports con ﬁ rm that the subunits Arp2 and Arp3 play a critical role as an actin nucleation core module , whereas the role of the other subunits is regulatory , determining the ef ﬁ ciency of actin nucleation as well as localization of the complex [ 8 , 53 , 54 ] . In the case of the L . monocytogenes model , it is interesting to mention that vinculin inactivation by siRNA did not perturb bacterial cellular invasion nor actin - based motility [ 9 ] , raising the possibility that other cellular molecule ( s ) not yet identi ﬁ ed participate in the localization / modulation of the Arp2 / 3 complex during L . monocytogenes infection - related processes . Concluding Remarks While the Arp2 / 3 complex has been classically considered as a single molecular entity for 20 years since its discovery , an emerging possibility from recent research suggests that multiple versions of the Arp2 / 3 complex may coexist in cells ( see Outstanding Questions ; Figure 1 , Key Figure , presents a summary of currently described complexes and their mode of regulation ) . Differential expression of the Arp2 / 3 complex subunits in various cells may drive this diversity . In the case of the L . monocytogenes system , in wild - type cells the subunit ARPC5 can be detected at both bacterial entry sites and actin comet tails by ﬂ uorescence microscopy , indicating that although ARPC5 is dispensable , Arp2 / 3 complexes containing this subunit may still be Outstanding Questions The regulation of the Arp2 / 3 complex diversity in cells is unclear at present . Available subunits could determine the composition of the complexes in some cellularcontexts . Noevidenceexistsfor subunit exchange in already formed Arp2 / 3 complexes , but this possibility can not be formally excluded . Which other molecules may be associ - ated with canonical subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex ? A future challenge will be to isolate and characterize the various Arp2 / 3 complexes , and assess their activity in vitro . Box 1 . Activation of the Arp2 / 3 Complex by NPFs The Arp2 / 3 complex is by itself an inef ﬁ cient actin nucleator , and requires the binding of nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) to stimulate its nucleation activity . While preformed actin ﬁ laments are also Arp2 / 3 complex activators [ 20 ] , the most ef ﬁ cient NPFs include the bacterial surface proteins ActA and RickA from L . monocytogenes and R . conorii respectively [ 15 , 33 , 61 ] as well as the eukaryotic WASP ( Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) [ 62 ] , SCAR / WAVE ( sup - pressor of cyclic AMP repressor / WASp - family verprolin - homologous protein ) [ 20 ] , WASH ( WASP and Scar homologue ) [ 63 ] , WHAMM ( WASP homolog associated with actin , membranes and microtubules ) [ 64 ] , and JMY ( junction mediating and regulatory protein , p53 cofactor ) [ 65 ] . These NPFs characteristically display a WCA domain ( W : WASP - homology 2 domain or WH2 , C : Connector , A : Acidic ; this domain is also known as VCA domain : Verprolin - Connector and Acidic - rich ) that increases the af ﬁ nity of Arp2 / 3 complex for the mother ﬁ lament , activating the complex [ 4 , 66 ] . NPFs like ActA and WASP dimerize to deliver actin monomers to the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 67 ] . NPFs dissociate from the Arp2 / 3 complex and may participate in multiple rounds of activation [ 68 ] . Box 2 . Actin Branching by the Arp2 / 3 Complex TheArp2 / 3complexgeneratesnewactin ﬁ lamentsthatbranch - offfromthesideofpre - existing ﬁ lamentsata70 8 angleto form a Y - branched network [ 23 ] . The use of electron tomography to reconstruct the branch junction suggested that the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits reorganize into a dimer , providing a template for elongation of the daughter ﬁ lament [ 52 ] . The remaining subunits , in particular ARPC2 and ARPC4 , were reported to make substantial contacts with the mother ﬁ lament and allow the anchoring of Arp3 as the ﬁ rst subunit of the daugther ﬁ lament [ 52 ] . Subsequent mutagenesis studies have con ﬁ rmed a role for ARPC2 and ARPC4 in providing an actin - ﬁ lament - binding interface which is critical for nucleation and branch stability [ 69 ] and suggest for the yeast Arc40 ( ARPC1 in mammalian cells , see nomenclature in Table 1 ) multiple essential roles , including suppression of spontaneous nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex and propagation of NPF activation signals [ 70 ] . Trends in Cell Biology , Month Year , Vol . xx , No . yy 5 TICB 1271 No . of Pages 8 functional during both processes [ 9 ] . It is possible that Arp2 / 3 complexes of different composition have overlapping functions during L . monocytogenes infection , but current data suggests that the precise composition ofdifferent Arp2 / 3 complexes playsa role in ﬁ ne - tuning actin rearrangements in both [ 53 _ TD $ DIFF ] cases . This hypothesis is supported by the observation that ARPC4 can be found predominantly early during bacterial actin comet tail formation and that knockdown of ARPC4 affects initial actin polymerization at the bacterial surface rather than actin tail elongation , indicating that different Arp2 / 3 complexes may be required in a sequential manner . The ﬁ ne - tuning of Arp2 / 3 complex actin polymerization activity depending on the subunit composition is also supported by results on the vaccinia virus system [ 10 ] [ 54 _ TD $ DIFF ] . It is highly anticipated that other examples of diverse Arp2 / 3 complexes in other systems will soon be reported .
