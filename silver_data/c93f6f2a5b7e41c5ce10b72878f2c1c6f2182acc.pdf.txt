Army Corps of Engineers Washington , DC 20314 - 1000 ERDC / EL SR - 15 - 1 ii Abstract The following methods provide a guide to measure mechanical properties of materials by means of an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) . Traditional nanoindentation measurements do not afford immediate complementary surface imaging to visualize the residual indent . This obstacle is overcome using AFM . By indenting a surface with a diamond - tipped , stiff cantilever , local nanoscopic materials properties may be deduced . Briefly , an appropriate AFM cantilever is calibrated to determine its deflection sensitivity and spring constant ; it is then used as both an imager and indenter at the surface of material of interest . The load applied by the cantilever is accurately controlled by knowledge of the deflection sensitivity . The maximum applied load is mediated by the cantilever spring constant . Following data collection , image and force curve analyses are completed to determine projected indent areas and load / unload profiles . This yields materials properties that include the material hardness and the Young’s modulus along with corresponding surface topography .

The primary goal of this Task was to develop robust SOPs for investigating the environmental health and safety ( EHS ) related properties of nanotechnologies including nanomaterials and products incorporating nanomaterials . This SOP describes how to determine the nanomechanical properties , hardness and Young’s modulus , at solid surfaces using atomic force microscopy . The present SOP combines best laboratory practices available from the literature and professional experience of ERDC research scientists . ERDC / EL SR - 15 - 1 1 1 Scope This SOP is used to investigate the mechanical properties of nanostructured materials or the properties of materials at the nanoscale . In particular , materials parameters including hardness and Young’s modulus are determined . This SOP is applicable to soft and semi - hard solid materials . Under the scope of this SOP , a diamond - tipped nanoindentation cantilever is used to indent gold as a reference for validation of the techniques . Figure 1 - 1 . Scientific operating procedure flow chart . ERDC / EL SR - 15 - 1 2 2 Background Nanomechanical characterization by means of atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) offers an advantageous route over other materials qualification methods as it provides an all - in - one testing / imaging / analysis approach . Nanoindentation , in particular , represents a versatile capability that may be realized using most modern AFM instrumentation . Nanoindentation is used to measure both the hardness and Young’s modulus at the nanoscale level . Accurate values for these parameters are dependent upon sufficient characterization of the indenter tip and an appropriate model describing the tip - surface interaction . The protocol presented here will outline the steps necessary to qualify the indenter tip and extract nanomechanical information from AFM - based force - curve analysis using a nanoindentation procedure . Tranchida and coworkers [ 1 ] described the preliminary determinations , calibrations , and analyses necessary to extract useful localized nanomechnical information from AFM force curves . The main points for consideration include : 1 . Sample properties 2 . Cantilever properties Contributions from an underlying substrate can obfuscate the nanomechanical properties of the sample of interest at large penetration depths of the AFM tip . Therefore , it is important that the analysis be confined to the sample itself . Generally , a penetration depth of no more than 10 % of the total sample thickness is recommended . Similarly , localized roughness of the sample can introduce distortions at the tip itself , such as a torsional force applied to the tip during approach . Thus , tip effects must be considered for even moderately rough samples ( i . e . , 1 - 3 nm RMS in a 1 um 2 area ) . Finally , it is critical that the cantilever be well - characterized to achieve reliable results . The applied load ( F ) is calculated from   sens thresh F kd kd t ( 1 ) where d represents the cantilever deflection and k the cantilever spring constant . Thus , the value k should be known with excellent accuracy ; this ERDC / EL SR - 15 - 1 3 value is generally supplied by the manufacturer for a specific tip and may be validated experimentally . In addition , the feedback loop for the cantilever / detection system must be calibrated . This involves determination of the cantilever deflection sensitivity ( d sens ; i . e . , the sensitivity of the optics to changing deflection ) . The deflection is calculated as the product of the deflection sensitivity and trigger threshold voltage ( t thresh ) as shown in Equation 1 . Tip shape is a third important factor ; this will influence the models chosen to investigate tip - surface interactions [ 2 ] . Tip shapes are generally known and provided by tip manufacturers and may be verified by electron microscopy imaging . ISO standard 14577 [ 3 ] provides an international standard for indentation testing using nanoindenters and hardness testers . The analyses of the load - depth curves obtained from the methodologies defined in ISO 14577 will be adapted for nanomechanical testing using AFM . In particular , the hardness value ( Hv ) will be calculated through Equation 2 , where F max is the maximum applied load and A is the projected area of contact based upon the tip shape .  max F Hv A ( 2 ) The sample indentation modulus ( E ) will be obtained through a model of tip - surface interaction appropriate for the tip shape . E is effectively analogous to the Young’s modulus at the nano scale . Although a wide range of models exist that describe various interactions and tip shapes , the Hertz or Sneddon models are generally employed . For isotropic samples , the Hertz model is a useful , simplified interaction descriptor . It is often used to describe indentation by a spherical indenter , and is applicable for shallow indentations , such as on a rigid film . The Hertz model is given in Equation 3 , where δ is the indenter penetration depth and ν is the sample Poisson’s ratio which can be estimated from tabulated values . Generally , for soft samples , or for unknown Poisson’s ratios , the value may be set to 0 . 5 . R is the radius of the spherical indenter .     3 2 2 4 3 1 / E R F δ v ( 3 ) ERDC / EL SR - 15 - 1 4 The Sneddon model [ 4 ] is applicable to a punch of conical profile and Equation 4 is used to determine E from an AFM force - curve , where α is the tip half angle .       2 2 2 1 tan E α F δ π v ( 4 ) ERDC / EL SR - 15 - 1 5 3 Terminology 3 . 1 Related Documents • ASTM STP 889 : Microindentation techniques in materials science and engineering • ISO 14577 - 1 : Metallic materials – instrumented indentation test for hardness and materials 3 . 2 Definitions • Aspect ratio , n—as applied to AFM cantilevers , the ratio of cantilever length to width . • Contact mode , n—the common method of AFM imaging , wherein a tip scans a surface of interest while remaining in close contact with the surface . • Deflection sensitivity , n—a conversion factor to translate voltage into cantilever deflection , obtained from the slope of a force curve at a hard surface ( i . e . , sapphire ) where indentation does not occur ( d sens ) . • Force curve , n—a plot of AFM cantilever deflection as a function of applied voltage .

In general , the stiffness of the cantilever should be close to the expected sample stiffness . Refer to § 5 . 1 for more detailed guidance on probe selection . 4 . 2 Apparatus An integrated atomic force microscope with nanoindentation capability shall be used for this SOP . Many modern instruments are equipped with the capability to perform indentation experiments and force curve measurements . The main requirements of the testing apparatus are that it be capable of applying and removing a known load ; and that it be capable of imaging the indented surface at a microscopic level without instrument reconfiguration . ERDC / EL SR - 15 - 1 8 5 Procedure • First , an appropriate tip is selected for the material to be investigated . • Next , the tip / cantilever is characterized to accurately determine its mechanical properties ( deflection sensitivity , spring constant ) . • Finally , the sample is scanned , nanoindented , and rescanned over the same area . 5 . 1 Probe Selection A suitable tapping mode tip should be selected for nanoindentation experiments to allow for indentation as well as high - resolution imaging that is not practical using standard indenters ( i . e . , Berkovich indenters ) . An appropriate spherical or conical tip shall be chosen . The ultimate choice of probe depends upon : ( 1 ) the maximum desired applied load and ( 2 ) the fragility of the sample to be indented . Many tips manufactured specifically for AFM nanoindentation are diamond with a sharp radius of curvature ( ~ 50 nm or less ) and well - defined angles . Cantilever stiffness is important to consider for the expected hardness of the sample to be indented . Fragile and soft materials ( i . e . , cells ) , for example , are prone to rupture if encumbered with too great a load or too sharp a tip , and should therefore not be analyzed using a very high spring constant probe . Generally , these guidelines are applicable to measurements made in a gaseous environment , at a solid surface . If measurements are to be conducted in liquid , specialized probes and cantilever holders are required , though the general principles still apply . The scope of this method is applicable to both spherical and conical tips ; although other shapes may be used for nanoindentation experiments , they will not be covered in the scope of this SOP . For indentation of cells and delicate biomaterials , cantilevers with spring constants in the range of mN / m should be suitable . For hard materials ( i . e . , bone ) , cantilevers with spring constants of > 100 N / m may be required . For soft and delicate materials , it is recommended to use a probe with a spherical tip to avoid rupture of the material . For harder samples , or for materials with extremely small dimensions ( i . e . , < tip radius , R ) , a conical indenter may be appropriate . A general guidance is provided in Table 5 - 1 .

Engage the indentation tip and collect a force curve . The plot should display deflection as a function of z - height / displacement . The slope of the curve in the contact region is the deflection sensitivity in V / nm ( Figure 5 - 1 ) . Figure 5 - 1 . Example force curve for nanoindenter tip interaction with a hard surface ( i . e . , sapphire ) for deflection sensitivity calibration . 5 . 2 . 2 Determine spring constant Several methods exist to calibrate the spring constant of AFM cantilevers , if these are not provided from a tip manufacturer . The recommended approaches are based on the availability of the techniques with particular instrumentation and the ratio of cantilever length , L , to width , b .

If this method is unavailable , it is suggested that the steps outlined in section 5 . 2 . 2 . 2 be used to estimate k regardless of cantilever aspect ratio . This method for spring constant determination treats the cantilever as a simple harmonic oscillator ( SHO ) . A power spectral density plot of the cantilever vertical deflection signal is generated by the instrument and is fit with an SHO model in fluid ( air ) to determine the mean square displacement of the cantilever [ 4 ] . This , in turn , is indirectly proportional to the cantilever spring constant . The ambient temperature should be recorded during the thermal tune . Ultimately , the approach results in an overall uncertainty of < 10 % in k [ 5 ] . 5 . 2 . 2 . 2 Sader method for cantilever calibration The Sader method [ 6 - 8 ] is a hydrodynamic predictive model for spring constant ( k ) calibration of a cantilever in fluid ( air ) . The governing equations for a rectangular cantilever are provided in Equations 5 - 7 . In Equation 5 , K 1 and K 0 represent modified Bessel functions of the second kind , and Re denotes the Reynolds number .

Alternatively , several web - based calculators and smartphone applications are dedicated to Sader - based calculations of spring constants for rectangular and arbitrarily - shaped cantilevers alike : • iPhone application : Sader Method [ http : / / itunes . apple . com / us / app / sader - method / id402544930 ] • Online : [ http : / / www . ampc . ms . unimelb . edu . au / afm / webapp . html ] 5 . 3 Sample Analysis Nanoindentation experiments should be carried out at ambient temperature ( i . e . , 25 °C ) and significant temperature fluctuations ( > ±5 °C ) during the course of the experiment should be avoided . The sample should be securely mounted such that it is stable for the duration of the experiment . If possible , the supported material should be vibrationally isolated . • Tune cantilever o Set drive frequency at center of resonant frequency peak o Adjust drive amplitude to achieve an RMS amplitude of ~ 240 mV • Locate a clean , uniform , level area at the sample surface o Area should be clear of debris and scratch marks / mars o Area should be representative of the sample • Engage the instrument in tapping mode • Scan a region approximately 3 x 3 μm 2 in area at a rate of < 1 Hz • Save scanned image • Following scan , collect force curves in the same area o Select a trigger threshold or range of trigger thresholds that will yield appropriate load ( s ) [ refer to Equation 1 ] o Perform a series of indents at different , representative locations within the imaged area ERDC / EL SR - 15 - 1 12 * Indents should be evenly spaced , with enough separation between them to avoid spillover from indentation pileup * Indents can be made in a matrix array ( i . e . , 3x3 or 5x5 ) for reproducibility analysis o Save force curves ( i . e . , deflection vs . z - sensor plots ) o Avoid penetration depths > ~ 80 % of the total film / material thickness so as to eliminate contributions from substrate * If penetration depths exceed the thickness of the material of interest , be sure to perform model fits to the data only in the region where the material of interest resides . • Return to image analysis and image the same area to reveal indentations o If indentations are not visible , it may be necessary to repeat with increasing trigger threshold values o If indentations overlap , repeat at a different location and use fewer indentations or a larger area • Save scanned image ERDC / EL SR - 15 - 1 13 6 Reporting 6 . 1 Analysis of Results The deflection sensitivity ( § 5 . 2 . 1 ) , spring constant ( § 5 . 2 . 2 ) , and trigger threshold ( § 5 . 3 ) are used to determine F for each indent using Equation 1 . 6 . 1 . 1 Determining nano hardness Hardness measurements at the nanoscale are made according to Equation 2 . Here , F max is determined in step 6 . 1 above . The projected area for each indent may be determined using image analysis software such as ImageJ . An example of area analysis for indents as a function of increasing force is provided in Figure 6 - 1 for < R > . Figure 6 - 1 . Indentations of increasing force ( from right to left in the image ) created using a diamond - tipped cantilever indenting a gold surface . The projected areas of the indentations are given in the inset . The maximum load applied at each indent was 41 . 1 , 31 . 6 , 22 . 1 , and 12 . 6 μN for ind ents 1 through 4 , respectively . Note that hardness values determined by this means are susceptible to error . This error arises due to microscopic contributions that cannot be neglected on the nanometer scale . Further reading on these phenomena may be perused in ASTM notes [ 9 ] . Increasing force 1 2 3 4 ERDC / EL SR - 15 - 1 14 6 . 1 . 2 Determining indentation modulus An analogous value to the Young’s modulus is derived from the shape of the extending force curves collected during indentation ( § 5 . 3 ) . Note that this value , E eff , contains information regarding the plastic deformation of both the surface ( E ) and the indenter tip ( E i ) , as in Equation 8 , where ν i is the Poisson’s ratio of the tip itself . Note that for comparative purposes , the trends in Young’s modulus for different materials indented by the same tip should be valid . In order to compare the Young’s modulus of materials analyzed by different AFM tips , it is necessary to determine the Poisson’s ratio and modulus of the tip material ( i . e . , diamond at 0 . 2 and 1220 GPa , respectively ) .     2 2 1 1 1 i eff i v v E E E ( 8 ) The value for the reduced modulus is obtained through a model that represents the interaction of the AFM tip with the flat surface of the material analyzed . In order to neglect tip - surface interaction effects , the approach or extend force curve must be analyzed , as the retract curve may contain artifacts of adhesion . To accurately model force curve data , it is necessary to ensure that the data are appropriately plotted . In particular , it is critical that the force curve represents the force vs . tip - sample separation rather than the cantilever height measured by the instrument ; this is the corrected force curve . The problem is depicted in Figure 6 - 2 for the approach . Once the force curve is plotted on the appropriate axes , the baseline should be flattened , if needed , to remove tilt in the non - contact region of the curve . Figure 6 - 2 . Deflection induced by tip - sample contact bends the cantilever by x . The instrument measures the piezo displacement , z . However , the penetration depth , δ , is required for analysis of the indentation modulus , and can be determined from z – x , given an accurate value of d sens . ERDC / EL SR - 15 - 1 15 The scope of this SOP covers the interaction of either a spherical tip probe or a conical tip probe with the surface . In either case , it is necessary to identify the contact point , or where the value of tip - sample separation is zero . This may be done using built - in analysis software on the nanoinden - tation AFM . For analysis of indents made using a spherical tip , proceed to § 6 . 1 . 2 . 1 ; to analyze results from a conical probe , proceed to § 6 . 1 . 2 . 2 . 6 . 1 . 2 . 1 Spherical tip – Hertz model The Hertz model is used to describe the interaction of a non - deformable , spherical - tipped probe indenting an infinitely - extending half space . It is applicable for indentations whose depths do not exceed that of the indenter radius . Equation 3 should be applied to corrected force curves obtained in § 5 . 3 . A fitting routine is commonly supplied in AFM force - curve analysis software . Several indentations of various depths should be analyzed for precision , but take care to analyze only those data for penetration depths < 10 % of the total film / material thickness to avoid confounding contributions from the underlying substrate . For more information on fitting force curves for indentations in the Hertzian regime , refer to [ 10 ] . 6 . 1 . 2 . 2 Conical tip – Sneddon model A modification of the Hertz model , the Sneddon model is applicable to conical indenters and should be employed when the penetration depth of the tip is greater than the tip radius . It is especially applicable to soft biological materials , such as cells , where the deformation depth imposed by indentation is often too deep to apply Hertz models . The Sneddon model is applied to the corrected force curve using Equation 4 . A fitting routine is commonly supplied in AFM force - curve analysis software . Several indentations of various depths should be analyzed for precision , but take care to analyze only those data for penetration depths < 10 % of the total film / material thickness to avoid confounding contributions from the underlying substrate . Fitting of the Sneddon model proceeds similarly to that of the Hertz model [ 10 ] . 6 . 2 Key Results Provided The results obtained from nanomechanical testing using AFM techniques are comparable to those gleaned from conventional nanoindentation measurements . There is an added benefit , however , in the ability to ERDC / EL SR - 15 - 1 16 directly image the indented area immediately after performing the indentation steps . This can yield information about material nano - hardness and elastic modulus . Both materials characteristics are relevant for assessing the durability of the material given its in - use exposure . 6 . 3 QA / QC Considerations After indentation in certain films / materials / surfaces / etc . , the indenter tip may become contaminated with undesired residue . This can result in skewed force curves and / or aberrations in AFM images . Should the tip become contaminated ( as evidenced by inconsistent force curves or streaking in AFM images ) , it may be necessary to remove the contaminant . In this case , indent a gold sample using a high force . It may be necessary to repeat the indentation on gold several times until the contaminant is removed . Note that the models presented herein ignore attractive and repulsive forces that may arise between the tip and surface even in the extend force curves . For a comprehensive approach to addressing intermolecular interactions during nanoindentation , one must consider more complicated interaction theories [ 11 ] . In most cases , ignoring these forces is acceptable . In light of the various sources of error that arise throughout the experimentation , from tip characterization to assumptions made regarding fitting models , to non - uniformities of examined surfaces , the expected error associated with the final reported Young’s modulus may reasonably exceed ±10 % . Strict adherence to tip qualifications and choice of the appropriate model will mitigate this error significantly . ERDC / EL SR - 15 - 1 17 References Tranchida , D . , Z . Kiflie , S .

ABSTRACT The following methods provide a guide to measure mechanical properties of materials by means of an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) . Traditional nanoindentation measurements do not afford immediate complementary surface imaging to visualize the residual indent . This obstacle is overcome using AFM . By indenting a surface with a diamond - tipped , stiff cantilever , local nanoscopic materials properties may be deduced . Briefly , an appropriate AFM cantilever is calibrated to determine its deflection sensitivity and spring constant ; it is then used as both an imager and indenter at the surface of material of interest . The load applied by the cantilever is accurately controlled by knowledge of the deflection sensitivity . The maximum applied load is mediated by the cantilever spring constant . Following data collection , image and force curve analyses are completed to determine projected indent areas and load / unload profiles . This yields materials properties that include the material hardness and the Young’s modulus along with corresponding surface topography . 15 .
