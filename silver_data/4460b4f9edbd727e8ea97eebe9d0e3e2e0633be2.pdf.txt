ABSTRACT Early surgical resection and chemotherapy of bone cancer are commonly used in the treatment of bone tumor , but it is still highly challenging to prevent recurrence and fill the bone defect caused by the resection site . In this work , we report a rational inte - gration of photonic - responsive two - dimensional ( 2D ) ultrathin niobium carbide ( Nb 2 C ) MXene nanosheets ( NSs ) into the 3D - printed bone - mimetic scaffolds ( NBGS ) for osteosar - coma treatment . The integrated 2D Nb 2 C - MXene NSs feature specific photonic response in the second near - infrared ( NIR - II ) biowindow with high tissue - penetrating depth , making it highly efficient in killing bone cancer cells . Importantly , Nb - based species released by the biodegradation of Nb 2 C MXene can obviously promote the neogenesis and migration of blood vessels in the defect site , which can transport more oxygen , vitamins and energy around the bone defect for the reparative process , and gather more immune cells around the defect site to accelerate the degradation of NBGS . The degradation of NBGS provides sufficient space for the bone remodeling . Besides , calcium and phosphate released during the degradation of the scaffold can promote the mineralization of new bone tissue . The intrinsic multifunctionality of killing bone tumor cell and promoting angiogenesis and bone regeneration makes the engineered Nb 2 C MXene - integrated composite scaffolds a distinctive implanting biomaterial on the efficient treatment of bone tumor .

Currently , surgical resection is the prevalent strategy to treat bone tumor [ 4 ] . However , the invasive nature of bone malignancies determines remnant tumor cell , which might induce local recurrence and surgical failure . Meanwhile , bone defect secondary to tumor resection is largely critical and skeletal repair is essential to anatomical reconstruction and functional recovery [ 4 , 5 ] . Although a substantial number of bone defects can be cured using the gold standard tech - nique of autologous bone grafting , the donor site is limited , and potential complications are the rising concerns following bone harvest [ 6 , 7 ] . Various bone defects contribute to heavy healthy and socioeconomic burdens worldwide [ 8 ] . The emerging bone tissue engineering and precision medicine have shed light on curing critical bone defect and tumor - targeted therapy in the past decade . On the one hand , biomaterials with high osteoconductivity , osteoin - ductivity and osseointegration are promising to repair bone defects , but few of them are qualified in tumor ablation [ 9 , 10 ] . On the other hand , the drug - loading and controlled - release system , especially the nanomaterials , can substan - tially improve the efficiency of targeted therapy of bone tumor [ 11 ] , but their therapeutic role may be effected by drug resistance after continuous chemotherapy . Multifunc - tional materials with tumor ablation and bone - remodeling capacities are expected to be developed for clinical bone tumor treatment [ 12 – 15 ] . Two - dimensional ( 2D ) MXene nanosheets ( NSs ) have emerged as the representative 2D layer structured materials comprised by carbides , nitrides or carbonitrides with abun - dant unique physiochemical properties [ 16 ] . In particular , 2D niobium carbide ( Nb 2 C ) MXene NSs are highly bio - compatible and biodegradable with intrinsic photoresponse Osteosarcoma cell ablation Osteosarcoma model 3D printing BGS 2D Nb 2 C NSs NBGS Bone defect model Angiogenesis Bone regeneration Photothermaltherapy Scheme 1 Schematic diagram of the process for photothermal ablation of osteosarcoma and bone regeneration by NBGS .

Very recently , we have demonstrated that Nb 2 C NSs acted as the photothermal conversion nanoagents for near - infrared ( NIR ) - triggered photonic hypothermia against breast cancer after intrave - nous administration [ 16 ] , making them highly applicable in the potential treatment of osteosarcoma . However , their therapeutic efficiency and biological effect in the sequential processes of photonic osteosarcoma ablation in the NIR - II biowindow and biomaterial - guided bone regeneration have not been achieved , which require further investigations for promoting 2D Nb 2 C MXene into tissue regeneration bio - medical field . Three - dimensional ( 3D ) - printed bioactive glass scaffolds ( BGS ) are featured with favorable degrada - tion rate [ 19 ] , stable drug release [ 20 ] , high biocompatibil - ity [ 21 ] and satisfactory osteoconductivity / osteoinductivity [ 22 ] . Therefore , the rational integration of 2D Nb 2 C MXenes into 3D porous BGS ( NBGS ) is expected to construct a mul - tifunctional scaffold with specific functionality of photonic bone tumor hyperthermia and improved bone regeneration . Herein , the ultrathin Nb 2 C MXene NSs were integrated into a 3D - printed bone - mimetic BGS , for vitalizing the compos - ite scaffolds with specific capability of photonic bone malig - nancy ablation in the NIR - II biowindow , while driving osse - ous regeneration by promoted neovascularization ( Scheme 1 ) . Noteworthy , the constructed NBGS are highly preferable for osteosarcoma treatment . Initially , the photothermal hyperther - mia was conducted after the implantation of multifunctional NBGS to kill bone tumor cells . Subsequently , the significant vascularization emerged to drive new osseous formation , and the coupled formation of blood vessels and bone structures were beneficial for the rapid repair of large bone defect fol - lowing the gradual degradation of the scaffolds . Therefore , the constructed multifunctional NBGS provides a distinctive bio - material scaffold for bone tumor treatment with simultaneous tumor therapeutic and bone tissue regeneration capabilities . 2 Experimental Section 2 . 1 Synthesis of NBGS The bioactive glass scaffolds ( BGS ) with bone - mimetic structure and the 2D Nb 2 C NSs were , respectively , prepared according to our previous reports [ 12 , 15 ] . Subsequently , the BGS were soaked in Nb 2 C NSs aqueous solution ( 10 min , at room temperature ) and then put in the drier ( 37 °C , 4 h ) . The above steps were repeated three times , and the Nb 2 C NS - modified BGS ( NBGS ) were obtained . BGS integrated with 0 . 5 mg mL −1 Nb 2 C NSs was denominated as 0 . 5 NBGS , and the other NBGS were also termed by this analogy . 2 . 2 Characterization Morphological images , energy - dispersive X - ray spectros - copy ( EDS ) and corresponding elemental mapping were obtained from a scanning electron microscopy ( SEM , field emission Magellan 400 ) . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) images were recorded by a transmission electron microscope ( JEM - 2100F transmission electron microscope , 200 kV ) . The elemental banding energy was analyzed by X - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS , ESCAlab250 , Thermo Scientific ) . Raman spectra of biomaterials were acquired by a Raman microscope ( HORIBA LabRAM HR800 ) . Phase analysis was calculated by X - ray diffrac - tometer ( XRD , Rigaku D / MAX - 2200PC ) . Mineralization function of the scaffolds was assessed in simulated body fluid ( SBF ) . BGS and NBGS were soaked in SBF for 24 h at 37 °C . Then they were dried at 60 °C for subsequent analy - sis of surface morphology and element with a SEM – EDS system . 2 . 3 In Vitro Photothermal Effect of NBGS BGS , 0 . 25 NBGS , 0 . 5 NBGS and 1 . 0 NBGS were irradiated by 1064 - nm laser , and corresponding temperature curves and thermal images were obtained by an infrared thermal imaging camera ( PLIR A325SC camera , USA ) . 1 . 0 NBGS were further exposed to laser irradiation at different power densities of 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 75 and 1 . 0 W cm −2 , 5 min , in phos - phate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . 2 . 4 In Vitro Cytotoxicity and Tumor cell Ablation Assays Saos - 2 cells ( human osteosarcoma tumor cells ) were cul - tured with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle media ( DMEM ) sup - plemented with 1 % penicillin / streptomycin and 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) . For in vitro cytotoxicity and cell abla - tion assay in NIR - II biowindow , Saos - 2 cells were inocu - lated into 48 - well plates ( 1 . 0 × 10 5 cells per well ) for 12 h to Nano - Micro Lett . ( 2020 ) 13 : 30 30 Page 4 of 18 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s40820 - 020 - 00547 - 6 © The authors ensure cellular attachment ; then , BGS and 1 . 0 NBGS were cultured with Saos - 2 cells for additional 24 h , respectively . According to the scheme , these samples were reasonably divided into six groups ( blank , laser only , BGS , BGS + laser , NBGS , NBGS + laser ; all lasers with 1064 nm wavelength irradiated at 1 . 0 W cm −2 power density for 5 min ; n = 6 ) . In order to investigate the effect of 1064 - nm laser irradiation on tumor cell ablation , irradiation durations ( 0 , 5 , 10 and 15 min ) , irradiation cycles ( 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 times ) and power densities ( 0 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 75 and 1 . 0 W cm −2 ) of photobased ther - mal ablation were further systematically evaluated . Eventu - ally , the OD value was detected by the Cell Counting Kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 ) assay after various treatments . 2 . 5 Live / dead Fluorescence Observation Saos - 2 cells were seeded into culture dishes ( 1 . 0 × 10 5 cells per dish ; NEST Biotechnology Co . LTD , Hong Kong , China ) for 24 h . Propidium iodide ( PI ) and calcein AM were added to the culture medium with Saos - 2 cells from different groups ( BGS , BGS + 1064 - nm laser , NBGS , NBGS + 1064 - nm laser ; all lasers were operated at 1 . 0 W cm −2 power den - sity for 5 min ) and the cell status was observed by a con - focal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM , Olympus BX53 , Olympus , Japan ) . 2 . 6 Vasculogenesis Assay The effect of BGS / NBGS on the capacity of cell migration and tube formation was assessed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) , which were originally purchased from Cell Bank of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai , China . Cells were cultured with endothelial cell medium ( ECM ) ( ScienCell , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . For wound healing assay , cells were seeded in a Culture - Insert ( ibidi GmbH , Gräfelfing , Ger - many ) . Four hours later , a cell - free gap was made , and cells were co - cultured with BGS / NBGS for 24 h to measure the migration of HUVECs . For transwell migration assay , cells were seeded into the upper chamber of 12 - well transwell plates , while BGS / NBGS were placed in the lower chamber with complete ECM plus 10 % FBS . After 24 h , HUVECs were stained with 0 . 5 % crystal violet and the migrated cells were imaged . For tube formation assay , polymerized Matrigel ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) was added to 48 - well plates and HUVECs were seeded on it . Images were obtained after 12 h and the total branching points and total tube length were evaluated using ImageJ . Additionally , vasculogenesis - related gene expression , including vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF - A ) , VEGF - B and fibroblast growth factor 2 ( FGF2 ) , was quantified by real - time PCR in HUVECs cul - tured with different scaffolds for 24 and 48 h [ 23 ] , with prim - ers as previously reported [ 24 ] . 2 . 7 In Vitro Osteogenesis‑Related Gene Expression of hBMSCs Human bone mesenchymal stem cells ( hBMSCs ) were origi - nally purchased from Cell Bank of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences . The mRNA expression of collagen 1 ( COL1 ) , Runt - related transcription factor 2 ( Runx2 ) , osteo - calcin ( OCN ) and , osteopontin ( OPN ) were quantified to assess the osteogenic differentiation of different scaffolds using real - time PCR . Cells were adhered in 6 - well plates and RNA were harvested after osteogenic induction for 7 days using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen ) . PrimeScript RT reagent kit ( Takara , Shiga , Japan ) was used for mRNA to be reversely transcribed into complementary DNA . ABI 7900 was used for quantitative analysis of the reverse transcrip - tion reaction . The data were normalized to glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) expression and ana - lyzed by the 2 −ΔΔCt method . 2 . 8 Alizarin Red S Staining Alizarin red S staining was used to evaluate the extracel - lular calcium deposition , revealing individual osteoinduc - tion capacity of different scaffolds . HBMSCs were seeded into 24 - transwell plates and co - cultured with BGS / NBGS in osteogenic differentiation medium for 21 days . After 21 days , cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then stained with Aliz - arin Red S ( 2 % aqueous , Sigma ) solution for 30 min . 2 . 9 In Vivo Photothermal Ablation Therapy All animal procedures were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Shanghai Sixth People’s Hospital . For in vivo photothermal therapy ( PTT ) evaluation , 1 × 10 5 Saos - 2 cells were injected subcutaneously into 4 - week - old healthy and Nano - Micro Lett . ( 2020 ) 13 : 30 Page 5 of 18 30 1 3 female nude BALB / c mice ( body weight ≈ 16 g ; Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co . , Ltd . ) to establish ectopic osteosarcoma model . 24 osteosarcoma - bearing mice were randomly divided into 4 groups ( BGS , BGS + NIR , NBGS , NBGS + NIR ; n = 6 ) when the tumor volume reached about 180 mm 3 . Small incisions around the edge tumor were made in the skin , and then , the capsule of the tumor was cut open . After BGS or NBGS scaffold ( 8 × 1 . 5 × 1 . 5 mm 3 ) was implanted into the center of the tumor , the wound was closed . Twenty - four hours after BGS / NBGS implantation , NIR irra - diation ( 1064 nm , 1 . 0 W cm −2 , 5 min ) was executed on the BGS + NIR and NBGS + NIR groups . A thermal imaging instrument ( FLIRTM A325SC camera , USA ) was used to col - lect the thermal images of the tumor site from all animals . The tumor tissues from one animal in each group were sectioned and stained with H & E , TUNEL and Ki - 67 one day after the osteosarcoma ablation for histological analysis . Major organs were also sectioned and stained with H & E to observe in vivo toxicity . Survival time of the mice ( n = 5 ) in different groups was recorded to draw survival curves . 2 . 10 Surgical Models of Calvarial Defect and Scaffold Implantation Twenty - four male Sprague – Dawley ( SD ) rats were used for surgical models of large calvarial defect and reparation with scaffold implantation . In detail , after anesthesia and steriliza - tion , the skin was incised to expose the calvarial sagittal suture . Then , 25 - mm - diameter defects were made in the frontal pari - etal bone using a slow speed electric trephine . The defects were implanted with BGS on the left side and NBGS on the con - tralateral side . Finally , the periosteum and skin were sutured separately to close the incision . Tetracycline hydrochloride , calcein AM and alizarin red were injected subcutaneously every 2 weeks after in vivo implantation of the scaffold . After another 3 weeks , half of the rats were executed and then per - fused with Microfil ( MV - 112 , Flow Tech , Inc . , Carver , MA ) after cardiac perfusion with heparinized saline and 4 % para - formaldehyde solution . The rats were kept at 4 °C overnight , and then , calvarial specimens were obtained and fixed with 4 % formalin . The rest of rats were successively executed by an overdose of anesthetic after 8 , 16 and 24 weeks . Peripheral blood and major organs were obtained for respective analysis . Craniums were harvested and then treated with 4 % paraform - aldehyde solution for 24 h before further analysis . 2 . 11 Micro‑CT Scanning and Analysis After fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde solution overnight , the newborn osseous regeneration surrounding the defect region were evaluated using the micro - CT - 80 system ( Sky - scan , Kontich , Belgium ) . The specimens were scanned at a resolution of 18 μm per voxel according to the estab - lished protocol [ 15 , 25 ] . After 3D reconstruction , bone mineral density ( BMD ) , bone volume ratio ( BV / TV ) and total porosity ( TOT ) were calculated to assess the new - born osseous tissue using the auxiliary software of the mCT - 80 system . After the scanning , half of the craniums were decalcified with a 10 % EDTA solution . The sam - ples were scanned again to reconstruct the vessels sur - rounding the calvarial defects using CTVol software after decalcification . 2 . 12 Histopathological Staining The rest craniums were dehydrated with graded ethanol and then embedded for histologic analysis to observe the newborn osseous tissue in the calvarial defects implanted with BGS / NBGS . The specimens were cut into 5 - mm - thick sections and then incubated at 60 °C for 1 . 5 h after decal - cification and paraffin . Hard tissue was sectioned to dem - onstrate newborn bone tissue and scaffold degradation in the defect using a CLSM . To evaluate the newborn osseous tissues , sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin , Masson trichrome and Goldner trichrome solutions . Photo - micrographs were acquired using a LEICA DM 4000 . For Goldner trichrome staining , sections were kept in Weigert’s hematoxylin for 30 min , washed in double - distilled water for 10 min and then stained with ponceau acid fuchsin , phosphomolybdic acid – orange G solution and light green stock solution sequentially . 2 . 13 Data Analysis Multivariate parametric data were analyzed using analy - sis of variance ( ANOVA ) with Tukey’s post hoc test . Statistical comparisons between two groups were based on Student’s two - sided t test as * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 ( sta - tistically significant ) . Quantitative data are reported as mean ± sd .

SEM images revealed that the niobium aluminum carbide ( Nb 2 AlC ) ceramics ( MAX phase ) , as prepared by solid - phase sintering , featured a densely layered microstruc - ture ( Fig . 1a ) . The SEM image and corresponding element content mapping exhibited that this MAX phase ceramic was ternary compounds including Nb , Al and C ( Fig . 1b ) . When the MAX phase solid was treated with HF acid , the multilayered structure was formed ( MXene , Fig . 1c , d ) and the content of Al was decreased obviously ( Fig . 1d ) . After further intercalated by TPAOH , the few - layered Nb 2 C NSs were obtained and observed by TEM ( Fig . 1e ) , showing that Nb 2 C NSs were almost transparent with an ultrathin ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( e ) ( f ) ( g ) Nb 2 C O 1s Al 2p 1000 800 I n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) R a m an i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) 600 400 Binding energy ( eV ) 200 0 100 200 300 400 Wavenumber ( cm −1 ) C 1s Nb 3d Nb 2 AlC ( d ) MAX phase MX phase Al C Nb Nb C Al Nb 2 C Nb 2 AlC ω3 ω4 Fig . 1 Fabrication and characterization of ultrathin 2D Nb 2 C MXene NSs . a , b SEM images of Nb 2 AlC ceramics with corresponding element mapping ( Nb , Al and C ) . c , d SEM images of multilayered Nb 2 C MXene and the corresponding element mapping ( Nb , Al and C ) . e TEM image of one - layered or few - layered Nb 2 C MXene NSs . f X - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) spectra of Nb 2 AlC bulk and Nb 2 C NSs . g Raman spectra of Nb 2 AlC bulk and Nb 2 C NSs .

It was demonstrated that compared with Nb 2 AlC , the signal strength of Nb element in Nb 2 C NSs was sig - nificantly enhanced , while that of Al element was reduced . In agreement with XPS data , Raman spectra revealed the element Al exhibited a significant loss in Nb 2 C NSs than in Nb 2 AlC powder ( Fig . 1g ) . After the treatment of HF and TPAOH , the typical vibration mode ω 3 was weakened or even disappeared , which implied that the Al layer was largely removed . The vibration mode ω 4 still existed , indi - cating the Nb 2 C NSs inherited the layered structure [ 26 ] .

In particular , NIR - II biowindow has attracted more interest for its higher spatial resolution and the deeper light penetration compared to the traditional NIR - I biowindow [ 27 , 28 ] . The previous studies [ 16 ] have demonstrated that the effective photothermal ablation based on NIR - II laser of subcutaneous xenograft tumor in nude mice could be achieved at the depth of ~ 4 mm . In addition , NIR - II laser achieved less attenuation of photothermal heat - ing compared to NIR - I laser penetrated through the same depth of the tissues . It has been suggested that Nb 2 C NSs have high potential for antitumor as a desirable PTT agent . To endow the 3D printing BGS the PTT capacity , Nb 2 C NSs were coated onto the surface of BGS via capillarity [ 29 ] . In this study , 3D printing bone - mimetic BGS were directly soaked in different concentrations of Nb 2 C NSs aqueous solution to obtain Nb 2 C - coated BGS . BGS coated by 0 . 5 mg mL −1 Nb 2 C NSs were termed as 0 . 5 NBGS , and other NBGS were nominated by the same analogy . Intuitively , from BGS , 0 . 25 NBGS , 0 . 5 NBGS to 1 . 0 NBGS , the color of different scaffolds gradually changed from white to black ( Figs . 2a – d ) , but their 3D well - defined microporous structures were not altered during Nb 2 C NSs modification ( Figs . 2e – h ) . Additionally , with the concen - tration of Nb 2 C NSs elevated , Nb 2 C NSs on the surface of NBGS increased accordingly ( Figs . 2i – l ) , while the micropores decreased ( Figs . 2m – p ) . Further , cross - sec - tional morphologies and enlarged interfacial SEM images of NBGS demonstrated the successful integration of Nb 2 C NSs and BGS ( Figs . S1e – g ) . The integration of NBGS was also validated by SEM - MAPPING on the surface of the composite scaffold , which revealed the co - localization of the two primary elements : Si from the BGS and Nb from Nb 2 C NSs ( Figs . S1a – d ) . The corresponding elemental dis - tribution tendencies of NBGS were detected by SEM – EDS ( Fig . S2a ) . Distinctly , from core to shell , Nb element con - tent increased , while Si and O elements content sharply decreased . XRD analysis ( Fig . 2q ) , XPS survey ( Figs . 2r and S2c – f ) and Raman spectra of BGS and NBGS ( Fig . 2s ) also provided solid evidences that Nb 2 C NSs were successfully integrated onto the surface of BGS . Reflected by XRD , there is a new peak at 20° for NBGS , in accordance with Nb 2 C NSs ( Fig . 2q ) . XPS peaks exhibited NBGS with an obvious peak of Nb 3d at ~ 200 eV binding energy compared with BGS ( Fig . 2r ) . Raman curves showed NBGS with an addi - tional peak at ~ 250 cm −1 ( Fig . 2s ) , which is consistent with the ω 4 vibration mode of Nb 2 C in Fig . 1g . 3 . 3 Photothermal Property and Antitumor Performance of NBGS Encouraged by the optical absorption property ( Fig . S2e ) and the previous demonstration that Nb 2 C NSs were prom - ising as the NIR - II laser - activated photothermal conversion nanoagents [ 30 ] , we explored the photothermal performance of the fabricated NBGS . As expected , NBGS induced a distinct temperature elevation when exposed to 1064 - nm laser irradiation ( Figs . S3a – d ) . The temperature was Nb 2 C concentration - dependent and laser power density depend - ent on both dry ( air ) and wet ( PBS ) environment . These data prompted us to explore the potential cytotoxicity and phototherapeutic effect on human osteosarcoma cell line of Saos - 2 . Hence , cell viabilities in six groups ( blank , BGS , NBGS , NIR only , BGS + NIR , NBGS + NIR group ) were assessed by a standard CCK - 8 assay ( Figs . 3b and S3e – g ) . On the one hand , the cell viabilities in the blank , BGS and NBGS groups are above 90 % , implying the low cytotoxicity and high biocompatibility of both BGS and NBGS . On the other hand , the NBGS + NIR group exhibited a higher cellular inhibition rate ( > 62 % ) , revealing highly efficient tumor cell ablation of NBGS as triggered by NIR laser . In addi - tion , Annexin V - FITC / PI staining was used to assess the apoptosis of Saos - 2 cells by flow cytometry ( Fig . S4 ) . The results demonstrated 50 . 6 % apoptotic cancer cells in the NBGS + NIR - treated group , remarkably higher than that in other control groups ( BGS , BGS + NIR , NBGS ) . Sub - sequently , Saos - 2 cells incubated with BGS / NBGS were stained by calcein acetoxymethyl ester ( calcein AM , green fluorescence ) and propidium iodide ( PI , red fluorescence ) following NIR irradiation or not for further in vitro live / dead cells assay . As distinctly displayed in the CLSM images ( Fig . 3c ) , the tumor cells in NBGS + NIR group presented conspicuously red signal , implying that the composite scaf - fold combined with NIR irradiation could effectively kill Nano - Micro Lett . ( 2020 ) 13 : 30 Page 9 of 18 30 1 3 tumor cells . In a distinct contrast , the Saos - 2 cells in BGS , BGS + NIR and NBGS groups revealed strong green flores - cence , demonstrating vital cells and rare cell death . The live / dead cell assay is completely in accordance with histological staining , CCK - 8 data and flow cytometry assay . Inspired by in vitro performance of killing osteosar - coma cells , in vivo antitumor experiment was performed to investigate the role of NBGS under NIR irradiation [ 31 – 34 ] . The phototriggered thermal ablation in NIR - II ( 1064 - nm laser ) was executed at the tumor site 24 h after the implan - tation of the scaffold . The temperature at the surface of xenograft was elevated to ~ 56 °C within 3 min of NIR irra - diation , which was considerably higher than control groups ( ~ 40 °C ) ( Figs . 3e and S6a ) .

( 2020 ) 13 : 30 Page 11 of 18 30 1 3 ablation efficacies were investigated by H & E , TUNEL and Ki - 67 staining on tumor specimen randomly harvested from each group ( Fig . 3d ) . TUNEL and H & E staining exhibited that there were fewer apoptotic tumor cells in three control groups ( BGS , BGS + NIR , NBGS ) . In contrast , apparent nuclear dissociation was observed in NBGS + NIR group , proving the death of Saos - 2 cells . Ki - 67 staining also sup - ported the findings by TUNEL and H & E staining . These results manifested that NBGS were excellent antitumor agents , with high performance of NIR - II laser - triggered pho - tothermal hyperthermia . Cytotoxicity of 2D materials and its complex interactions with systemic organs remain the issues of concern [ 35 ] . In order to evaluate the acute toxic effects of NBGS , the major organs of mice were harvested for H & E staining at 24 h post - laser irradiation . Obviously , there was no prominent inflammation infiltration or other pathological abnormalities in the treatment and control groups , imply - ing the desirable biosafety of NBGS for photothermal bone tumor ablation ( Fig . S6b ) . After photonic therapy , the body weight and tumor vol - ume of these mice were measured every two days , and the survival status was recorded simultaneously . NBGS plus laser irradiation effectively restrained the osteosarcoma growth , but protocols in control groups ( BGS ; BGS + NIR ; NBGS ) yielded ignorable therapeutic effects ( Fig . 3f ) . The body weight of all animals displayed no significant differ - ence within 14 days , suggesting the high biocompatibility and biosafety of NBGS ( Fig . 3g ) . The survival time of ani - mals in NBGS + NIR group was extended to 47 ± 4 . 5 days compared to 20 ± 2 . 1 days for BGS , 23 ± 1 . 3 days for BGS + NIR and 24 ± 2 . 2 days for NBGS group , suggest - ing that the tumor ablation by photothermal ablation could dramatically promote overall survival ( Fig . 3h ) . These successful therapeutic outcomes confirm that NBGS have potentially clinical application as a highly efficient NIR - II - induced PTT agent with excellent biosafety both in vitro and in vivo . 3 . 4 NBGS Stimulate Neovascularization both In Vitro and In Vivo Blood vessels play a crucial role in the entire process of skel - etal development and postnatal bone repair [ 36 , 37 ] . Neovas - cularization , including angiogenesis ( i . e . , formation of new capillaries from preexisting vessels ) and vasculogenesis ( i . e . , de novo vessel formation ) [ 38 ] , has an intimate relationship with bone formation to repair the large cranial defect [ 39 ] . When bone injury and defect occur , triggered inflammation and recruitment of precursor cells through peripheral blood vessels are essential for the formation of newborn bone [ 40 ] . Because prior studies rarely showed the function of Nb ele - ment in new vasculature formation during bone regenera - tion [ 41 , 42 ] , we evaluated and compared the exact effects of BGS and NBGS on local vasculogenesis using human umbilical endothelial vein cells ( HUVECs ) model in vitro and vascular formation using microvascular perfusion and reconstruction in vivo . In general , the HUVECs model was used to assess the migration , proliferation and tube forma - tion during vasculogenesis [ 43 ] . In detail , scratch wound healing assay ( Fig . 4a ) and transwell assay ( Fig . 4b ) were used to analyze the migration ability of endothelial cells co - cultured with BGS / NBGS . The results indicated that NBGS conspicuously accelerated the migration capacity of HUEVCs when compared with control and BGS group . The proliferation of HUEVCs was detected by CCK - 8 pro - tocol , showing no significant difference among three groups ( Fig . 4c ) . Moreover , tube formation , presented as honey - comb - like structures to reveal the vasculogenic potential , showed an obvious priority when HUVECs were co - cultured with NBGS for 24 h ( Fig . 4d ) . The capacity of tube forma - tion was quantified by the branch numbers and tube length assay , which showed more branch numbers and elongated tubelike structures in NBGS group ( Figs . 4e , f ) . In order to clarify the mechanism by which NBGS promotes a better angiogenesis , tube - related genes such as VEGF - A , VEGF - B and FGF2 were detected by QPCR . As shown in Fig . 4g – i , both BGS and NBGS could upregulate vasculogenesis - related genes expression after continuous culture for 1 and 2 days . Nevertheless , the NBGS could persistently promote the expression of VEGF - B and FGF2 when compared to BGS group , indicating a better performance to promote vasculogenesis . Taken together , these results demonstrated that the NBGS were non - cytotoxic to HUVECs and signifi - cantly strengthened vasculogenesis capacity of endothelial cells in vitro . In vivo angiogenic performance surrounding the scaffold was explored through Microfil perfusion and angiography using micro - CT scanning after 3 weeks of implantation . Particularly , 3D micro - CT reconstruction ( Figs . 4k – n ) and quantitative analysis of newborn vessels ( Fig . 4o ) directly exhibited denser vascular networks encircling the NBGS .

In addition , the blurry outlines of both scaffolds indicated their partial degradation . Therefore , the stimulatory vascularization by Nb released from NBGS , evidenced by both in vitro and in vivo findings , might become a desired companion for cou - pled osteogenesis , especially for the anatomical site with a poor circulation .

The Ca / P ratio which is closer to hydroxyapatite composi - tion indicated a better mineralization capacity . Therefore , the potential of bioactive scaffolds to form apatite in SBF is of high significance [ 44 , 45 ] . After immersed into SBF , the surface morphology of BGS changed from relatively smooth to rough with pronounced granular mineral deposition ( Figs . S7a , b ) . The Ca / P ratio of the surface minerals was approxi - mately 1 . 25 ( Fig . S7c ) . Compared with BGS group , NBGS had more minerals deposited on the surface ( Figs . S7d , e ) and the Ca / P ratio of surface minerals ( ~ 1 . 53 ) was closer to the typical Ca / P of hydroxyapatite ( = 1 . 67 ) ( Fig . S7f ) . The Ca / P ratio of NBGS is beneficial for osteogenic dif - ferentiation and bone mineralization , yielding a better per - formance in bone regeneration in vivo . Cell – biomaterial interactions play important roles for biocompatibility and bioactivity [ 46 – 49 ] . Human bone marrow stem cells ( hBM - SCs ) on NBGS and BGS attached tightly to the scaffolds , with well - spread morphology and many pseudopods pen - etrating into the 3D interconnected macropores of scaffolds ( Figs . S7g , h ) , indicating high cytocompatibility of both scaffolds . Meanwhile , the proliferation and cytoskeleton staining of hBMSCs on NBGS and BGS were observed by CLSM ( Fig . 5a ) . The cytoskeleton of hBMSCs was stained by rhodamine phalloidin and the nuclei were stained by DAPI ( blue ) . The relatively stronger fluorescence at the 7th day than the 1st day showed the gradual propagation of hBMSCs . Notably , the NBGS induced better results of cell proliferation , larger cells spreading areas and morphological changes , revealing a better participation of Nb 2 C NSs for cell attachment , growth and proliferation . Matrix mineralization is an essential process for the matu - ration of induced osteogenesis [ 50 ] . In the progress of osteo - genesis and matrix maturation , a cascade of osteogenesis - associated biomarkers , including RUNX2 , OPN , COL1 and OCN , are upregulated . In our study , with hBMSCs cultured for 3 days , it was found that the expression of COL1 , OCN and OPN in NBGS group were dramatically upregulated when compared with BGS group , reflecting an excellent bioactivity and osteoinductivity of NBGS ( Fig . 5b ) . The alizarin red S staining was performed , as another indica - tor of extracellular mineralization . 24 - transwell plates were used for alizarin red S staining with the scaffolds on the upper chamber co - cultured with hBMSCs for 3 weeks . The degree of extracellular calcium deposits in NBGS group was considerably more obvious than that of BGS and control groups ( Fig . 5c ) , which demonstrated the promoted miner - alization by NBGS . Therefore , the prepared NBGS , possess - ing excellent bioactivity , biocompatibility and osteoinductiv - ity , could be used as an optimal biomaterial in driving bone regeneration . The bone defect model in SD rats is the currently most common model for the research of bone defect regenera - tion . Very rare orthotopic osteosarcomatous model has been successfully established in the larger animals to evaluate the curative effect on tumor ablation and bone reconstruction simultaneously due to the intrinsic immu - nological rejection , which is the technical challenge and difficulty at current stage . Therefore , it is highly difficult to develop and establish osteosarcoma and bone defect in the same in vivo model . We established subcutaneous osteosarcoma model in nude mice to evaluate the pho - tothermal effect of NBGS on tumor therapy and investi - gated the in vivo osteogenic capability of the NBGS in Sprague – Dawley rats . This strategy has been extensively adopted and accepted for evaluating the performances of bone tumor therapy and bone defect regeneration [ 14 , 15 , 51 , 52 ] . In our experiments , we established a bone defect model on the both sides ( right and left ) of the crania of Sprague – Dawley rats , to implant NBGS and BGS into the defect site , respectively . The hyperthermia resulting from photothermal therapy may potentially damage the brain tissue next to the bone defect site . Therefore , the effect of NBGS combined with NIR - II laser on the outcomes of angiogenesis / neovascularization as well as osteogenesis , may not be recommended to be evaluated . Meanwhile , the previous related researches confirmed that the long - term bone regeneration process was not affected by the short - time NIR irradiation [ 12 , 14 ] . The efficacy of NBGS in pro - moting calvarial regeneration was evaluated by micro - CT scanning ( Figs . 5f – i ) . Bone regeneration capability of BGS and NBGS was evaluated by quantitative analysis of funda - mental parameters based on the histomorphometric micro - CT analysis . ( Figs . 5j – l ) . Bone volume / tissue volume ( BV / TV ) ( Fig . 5j ) , bone mineral density ( BMD ) ( Fig . 5k ) and total porosity ( TOT ) ( Fig . 5l ) revealed the prominent role of Nb released from NBGS . BV / TV showed that the per - centage of newborn bone tissue volume treated with NBGS Nano - Micro Lett . ( 2020 ) 13 : 30 30 Page 14 of 18 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s40820 - 020 - 00547 - 6 © The authors group was significantly higher than the BGS group . The average BMD in the region of interest manifested the bone regeneration process from the circular defect areas , while the lower TOT indicated a better interior structure of new - born bone tissue [ 53 ] . Much more calcified tissue around the defect area in NBGS group confirmed the better efficiency for newborn bone regeneration than BGS group ( Figs . 5d , e ) . Newborn osseous tissue of NBGS group almost filled up the defect area with few residual scaffolds left ( Figs . 5f – i ) . The NBGS itself exhibited a desirable degradation rate and reconstruc - tion rate of skeletal tissue , while more residual scaffold and fewer new osseous tissues were seen in BGS group . In addition , the peripheral blood was collected to investi - gate systemic toxicity of BGS / NBGS in vivo , and the major organs were obtained and sectioned for histological analy - sis after execution . Venous blood and organs from normal rats without any treatment were set as the control ( Fig . S8 ) . The results showed that both BGS and NBGS were featured with high biocompatibility , without significant pathological abnormalities in all animals . Confocal fluorescence images were conducted for fur - ther histological assessment . Different colors of newborn osseous represented dynamic bone formation ( Figs . 6a – e ) . Blue fluorescence revealed the osteogenesis process dur - ing week 2 – 4 , green fluorescence showed ossification from week 4 to 6 and red fluorescence reflected bone formation in the last 3 weeks . Compared with BGS , the newborn bone around NBGS exhibited excellent osteogenic performance ( Figs . 6b – e ) . Green and red fluorescence in NBGS group was much more obvious than BGS group , indicating a better bone formation capacity during the last 5 weeks . To evaluate the efficacy of NBGS and BGS for bone regeneration , a cascade of histological staining and analy - sis , including H & E staining ( Figs . 6f – h ) , Masson trichrome staining ( Figs . 6i – k ) and Goldner trichrome staining ( Figs . 6l – n ) , were further conducted to reveal microscopic reparation . A large amount of mineralized bone tissue ( yel - low arrows ) was found in the bone defect implanted with NBGS as evidenced by H & E staining and Masson tri - chrome staining ( Figs . 6g , h , j , k m and n ) and no obvious residual scaffold left ( Figs . 6g , j and m ) .

( 2020 ) 13 : 30 Page 15 of 18 30 1 3 trichrome staining showed that the defect region in BGS group displayed a mixture of new osteoid tissue ( red tis - sue ) surrounding the residual materials ( yellow arrows ) ( Fig . 6m ) . There was a great deal of mineralized bone tissue ( emerald green tissue ) filled in the defect region of NBGS group . The region of bone defect was fully filled with min - eralized bone at week 24 , without remnant NBGS scaffolds ( Fig . 6n ) . This result showed the desirable capacities of bone regeneration and scaffold degradation . CLSM images of the newborn osseous tissues in the cir - cular defect regions presented along the pores of the scaffold ( Figs . 7a – d ) . Corresponding to these results , the yellow dotted line ( Figs . 7e , f ) along the space of the NBGS and the cranial surface marked newborn osseous tissue , indicating an excellent material - guided bone regeneration in vivo . Figure 7g – i shows newborn bone tissue formation of the NBGS during differ - ent periods ( week 8 , 16 and 24 ) . Images at week 8 showed a myriad of fibroblasts distributed among the hierarchical space of scaffolds , similar to the early stage of bone formation . The osteoid in red color was gradually increased and intercon - nected around the biomaterials along with the scaffold bio - degradation at week 16 , demonstrating the fabulously synchro - nized processes of bone formation and scaffold degradation in NBGS group . The excellent therapeutic efficacy is attributed to the desirable connectivity of the porous scaffolds , with desired properties of conductivity and inductivity of vascularization , which is essential to promote bone regeneration and scaffold degradation [ 9 , 54 , 55 ] . Nb - based species released by the biodegradation of Nb 2 C MXene can obviously promote the blood vessel formation , gathering more immune cells around the defect site to accelerate the degradation of NBGS . Mean - while , large amount of nutrient substance , oxygen and BMSCs were transported through newborn vessels to the bone defect site to promote bone regeneration . Moreover , the degradation of NBGS provides sufficient space for the bone remodeling . In addition , calcium ( Ca 2 + ) and phosphate ( PO 43− ) released dur - ing the degradation of the scaffold can promote the mineraliza - tion of new bone tissue .

These make the process of scaffold degrada - tion and new bone formation coordinate with each other , and the new bone tissue immediately replaces the scaffold material to fill the bone defect . All these experiments both in vitro and in vivo indicated that Nb 2 C NSs integrated with BGS were highly biocom - patible , proangiogenic , osteoconductive and osteoinductive , which facilitate the repair of large bone defects , along with the photothermal therapy to ablate bone malignancy . 4 Conclusions In summary , we have constructed a multifunctional 3D bone - mimetic scaffolds , which holds high biocompatibility , intriguing photothermal property in NIR - II biowindow and specific performance of driving coupled angiogenesis and osteogenesis . Taking the advantage of photonic - responsive performance of 2D Nb 2 C NSs under NIR - II laser irradiation , NBGS acquires deeper tissue penetration during NIR - II - trig - gered photonic hyperthermia and benefits significantly to the therapy of osteosarcoma , prolonging the lifespan of tumor - bearing mice . Meanwhile , the introduction of Nb element in 2D Nb 2 C MXene enables NBGS with the capability of pro - moting angiogenesis , which substantially facilitates osseous regeneration to repair large bone defect . The interconnected capacities of vasculature formation and bone regeneration merit the rising concern in tissue engineering . This intriguing scaffold has markedly enriched the options of treating bone malignancy and defect . Therefore , it is envisioned that NBGS as promising multifunctional bioscaffolds hold high potential in bone tissue engineering and photonic - responsive therapeu - tic applications on combating osteosarcoma .
