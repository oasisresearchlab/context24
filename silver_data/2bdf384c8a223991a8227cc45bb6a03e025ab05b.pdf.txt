Some myosins - I have an additional C - terminal extension ( C ext ) that promotes Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin polymerization . The head and the tail are separated by a neck that binds calmodulin or calmodulin - related light chains . Myosins - I are known to participate in actin - dependent membrane remodelling . However , the molecular mechanisms controlling their recruitment and their biochemical activities in vivo are far from being understood . In this study , we provided evidence suggest - ing the existence of an inhibitory interaction between the TH1 domain of the yeast myosin - I Myo5 and its C ext . The TH1 domain prevented binding of the Myo5 C ext to the yeast WIP homologue Vrp1 , Myo5 C ext - induced actin poly - merization and recruitment of the Myo5 C ext to endocytic sites . Our data also indicated that calmodulin dissociation from Myo5 weakened the interaction between the neck and TH1 domains and the C ext . Concomitantly , calmodulin dissociation triggered Myo5 binding to Vrp1 , extended the myosin - I lifespan at endocytic sites and activated Myo5 - induced actin polymerization .

Besides the N - terminal actin - activated ATPase that trans - locates actin ﬁlaments , all myosins - I bear a Tail Homology 1 ( TH1 ) domain that binds acidic phospholipids in vitro ( Pollard et al , 1991 ) . The motor head and the TH1 domain are separated by an a helical neck that associates with calmodulin or calmodulin - related light chains ( Pollard et al , 1991 ) . In addition , the so - called long - tailed myosins - I bear a C - terminal extension ( C ext ) , which can trigger Arp2 / 3 com - plex - dependent actin polymerization . The C ext includes a Tail Homology 2 ( TH2 ) domain , which binds ﬁlamentous actin ( Pollard et al , 1991 ) and a Src Homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain , which associates with proline - rich motifs ( Kuriyan and Cowburn , 1997 ) . The fungal myosins - I also bear an acidic peptide , which directly participates in the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Evangelista et al , 2000 ; Lechler et al , 2000 , 2001 ; Lee et al , 2000 ; Idrissi et al , 2002 ; Sun et al , 2006 ) ( Figure 1B ) . The protozoal and the long - tailed mammalian myosins - I lack this acidic peptide but might indirectly activate the Arp2 / 3 complex through association with CARMIL ( Jung et al , 2001 ) . Myosins - I participate in a number of processes requiring actin - dependent remodelling or movement of cellular mem - branes . These include clathrin - dependent endocytic budding in yeast and mammals ( Geli and Riezman , 1996 ; Sun et al , 2006 ; Krendel et al , 2007 ) , vacuole contraction , cell motility , phagocytosis and pinocytosis in protozoa ( Jung and Hammer , 1990 ; Wessels et al , 1991 ; Doberstein et al , 1993 ; Titus et al , 1993 ; Novak et al , 1995 ; Novak and Titus , 1997 ) , and membrane trafﬁc along the endocytic and secretory pathways in protozoa and higher eukaryotes ( Fath et al , 1994 ; Durrbach et al , 1996 , 2000 ; Temesvari et al , 1996 ; Raposo et al , 1999 ; Huber et al , 2000 ; Neuhaus and Soldati , 2000 ; Cordonnier et al , 2001 ; Bose et al , 2002 ) . Thus , myosin - I function requires its precise targeting and / or activation at particular membrane subdomains . Despite intense research on these proteins , the mechanisms that spatially and temporally deﬁne their recruit - ment and / or regulate their biochemical activities in vivo are poorly understood . The yeast long - tailed myosin - I Myo5 , and its homologue Myo3 , are well - characterized members of the myosin - I family . Myo5 and Myo3 participate in the formation of endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane ( PM ) ( Geli and Riezman , 1996 ) . Myo5 is recruited to endocytic sites labelled with clathrin , stays anchored at the PM for 10 to 15s and disappears around the time the endocytic coat moves into the cytosol ( Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ; Sun et al , 2006 ) . During the transient association of the myosins - I with the endocytic sites , their mechanochemical activity and their actin polymerization promoting activity contribute to vesicle budding ( Sun et al , 2006 ; Galletta et al , 2008 ; Idrissi et al , 2008 ) .

Mutation of this domain or deletion of the SH3 interacting partners Vrp1 / WIP ( WASP - interacting protein ) or Las17 / WASP ( Wiskott – Aldrich syn - drome protein ) causes partial mislocalization of the myosin to the cytosol ( Anderson et al , 1998 ; Sun et al , 2006 ) . Intriguingly , Vrp1 and Las17 arrive signiﬁcantly earlier than the myosin at the endocytic sites , indicating that their asso - ciation with Myo5 might be regulated ( Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ; Sun et al , 2006 ) . On the other hand , domains other than the SH3 are involved in the cortical recruitment of Myo5 as the SH3 domain alone does not localize to endocytic patches ( Anderson et al , 1998 ) . In this study , we provided evidence indicating the exis - tence of an inhibitory interaction between the TH1 domain and the C ext , which prevented Myo5 binding to Vrp1 . Interestingly , we found that dissociation of Cmd1 from the Myo5 neck weakened the interaction between a fragment containing the neck and TH1 domain and the C ext . Concomitantly , Cmd1 dissociation promoted binding of Myo5 to Vrp1 . Consistent with previous observations indicat - ing that Vrp1 participates in Myo5 recruitment to cortical endocytic sites ( Anderson et al , 1998 ; Sun et al , 2006 ) and that Vrp1 is required to trigger Myo5 - induced actin polymeri - zation ( Geli et al , 2000 ; Lechler et al , 2001 ; Sun et al , 2006 ) , we found that Cmd1 dissociation from the myosin elongated A B GFP - Myo5 GFP GFP GFP GFP GFP GFP GFP GFP GFP - HnT GFP - Hn GFP - H GFP - nTC GFP - TC GFP - C GFP - HnC GFP - HTC GFP Head C - terminal extension TH1 Acidic peptide Neck TH2 SH3 IQ motifs GFP - HC GFP GFP - HnT GFP - Hn GFP - nTC GFP - TC GFP - H GFP - HTC GFP - Myo5 GFP - HC GFP - HnC GFP - C Figure 1 Subcellular localization of GFP - Myo5 constructs .

Results The Myo5 TH1 domain interacts with the C ext and negatively regulates association with Vrp1 and recruitment to endocytic sites To analyse the function of different domains in the recruit - ment of Myo5 to cortical patches , we investigated the loca - lization of GFP - tagged full - length or truncated Myo5 by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Figure 1 ) . As previously shown , full - length Myo5 ( GFP - Myo5 ) concentrated at cortical patches that partially colocalized with endocytic markers ( Figure 1A ; Supplementary Figure S1A ) ( Anderson et al , 1998 ; Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ; Sun et al , 2006 ) . In addition , a diffuse PM and a weak cytosolic staining were observed . Consistent with the observation that the SH3 domain is required for Myo5 localization ( Anderson et al , 1998 ) , truncation of the C ext ( GFP - HnT ) impaired cortical patch recruitment ( Figure 1A ) . On the other hand , we found that the complete C ext ( GFP - C ) was recruited to endocytic sites ( Figure 1A ; Supplementary Figure S1A ) , even though a strong cytosolic signal was also observed for this construct . The overexpression of GFP - C compared with GFP - Myo5 could account for the partial mislocalization of the C ext ( Supplementary Figure S1B ) . In addition , the absence of the TH1 lipid - binding domain , which targets other myosins - I to speciﬁc cellular membranes , could partially impair proper recruitment of Myo5 to the PM . However , we observed that addition of amino acids 774 to 996 of the TH1 domain to the C ext ( GFP - TC ) did not improve Myo5 localization but rather mistargeted the myosin to the cytosol and the nucleus ( Figure 1A ) . Interestingly , cortical patch localization was recovered with addition of the neck and 15 amino acids of the N - terminus of the TH1 domain ( GFP - nTC ) ( Figure 1A ; Supplementary Figure S1A ) . These results suggested that the Myo5 neck might be required to release an inhibitory interaction between the TH1 domain and the C ext . Consistent with this hypothesis , a GFP fusion protein lacking only the neck ( GFP - HTC ) lost the cortical patch localization , which was partially recovered by deletion of the TH1 ( GFP - HC ) ( Figure 1A ; Supplementary Figure S1A ) . Conversely , a GFP fusion protein missing only the TH1 domain ( GFP - HnC ) was still recruited to endocytic sites ( Figure 1A ; Supplementary Figure S1A ) , although the ab - sence of the TH1 domain again increased the cytosolic signal . Binding of the Myo5 C ext to Vrp1 participates in the myosin recruitment to endocytic patches ( Anderson et al , 1998 ; Sun et al , 2006 ) . Therefore , we next investigated whether the presence of the TH1 domain interfered with Myo5 binding to Vrp1 in the absence of the neck . Extracts of yeast cells expressing different Protein A ( PA ) - tagged Myo5 constructs and haemagglutinin ( HA ) - tagged Vrp1 ( Vrp1 - HA ) were sub - jected to IgG pull downs . The presence of Vrp1 - HA in the precipitates was detected by immunoblotting . As shown in Figures 1A and 2A , a correlation between the cortical patch localization and Vrp1 - HA binding was observed for the different constructs . Thus , a construct bearing the Myo5 C ext ( PA - C ) pulled down Vrp1 - HA but addition of a TH1 domain ( PA - TC ) blocked the interaction . Further , the pre - sence of the Myo5 neck and 15 amino acids of the N - terminus of the TH1 domain ( PA - nTC ) recovered Vrp1 - HA binding to levels similar to the wild - type ( wt ) myosin . Also consistent with our model , deletion of the TH1 domain ( PA - HnC ) signiﬁcantly increased binding of Myo5 to Vrp1 - HA , whereas deletion of the neck ( PA - HTC ) completely abolished the interaction . Deletion of the neck did not seem to grossly affect the structure of the tail as the PA - HTC construct still bound to Rvs167 similar to the wt protein ( Geli et al , 2000 ; Tong et al , 2002 ) ( Figure 2B ) . Previous results suggested an intramolecular interaction between the TH1 domain and the C ext of the protozoal long - tailed myosins - I ( Jontes et al , 1998 ; Lee et al , 1999 ; Ishikawa et al , 2004 ; Hwang et al , 2007 ) . We failed to express sig - niﬁcant amounts of the TH1 domain alone , but pull - down experiments using the C ext fused to GST ( GST - C ) and yeast extracts expressing PA - tagged Myo5 truncations bearing the H , Hn , HT and HnT fragments demonstrated a speciﬁc inter - action between the C ext and the TH1 domain , which seemed to be stabilized by the presence of the neck ( Figure 2C ) . The interaction between the nT fragment and the C ext was direct , as the nT fragment could be overlaid with GST - C puriﬁed from Escherichia coli ( Figure 2D ) . To analyse whether the nT fragment interfered with the C ext - dependent Myo5 / Vrp1 interaction , PA - C was pulled down from yeast expressing Vrp1 - HA and overexpressing LexA fused to the Myo5 neck and TH1 domains ( LexA - nT ) or LexA fused to Rvs167 as a control . As shown in Figure 2E , LexA - nT was pulled down with the C ext and signiﬁcantly interfered with the Myo5 / Vrp1 interaction when compared with LexA - Rvs167 . The Vrp1 - HA signal was reduced 6 . 57 ± 1 . 02 - fold ( n ¼ 3 ) in the pull downs from cells expres - sing LexA - nT with respect to those expressing LexA - Rvs167 . The inhibitory domain was contained within the TH1 domain as a LexA - n construct still interacted with PA - C but failed to interfere with Vrp1 - HA binding ( Figure 2E ) . Cmd1 dissociation from the Myo5 neck weakens the neck - TH1 / C ext interaction and promotes Myo5 binding to Vrp1 Our results suggested that the neck and the TH1 domains interact with the Myo5 C ext , that the TH1 domain interferes with Myo5 binding to Vrp1 and that the adjacent Myo5 neck modulates the release of the neck - TH1 / C ext interaction . To investigate whether calmodulin association / dissociation from the Myo5 neck might inﬂuence Myo5 binding to Vrp1 , PA - Myo5 was precipitated with IgG - Sepharose from an ex - tract of yeast expressing Vrp1 - HA in the absence or presence of 5 mM CaCl 2 . The Myo5 neck contains two IQ motifs , which bind calmodulin in the absence of Ca 2 þ . Addition of 5 mM CaCl 2 triggers dissociation of calmodulin ( Geli et al , 1998 ) . As shown in Figure 3A , addition of calcium signiﬁcantly reduced Cmd1 association to Myo5 and concomitantly increased the Myo5 / Vrp1 interaction . Vrp1 speciﬁcally bound PA - Myo5 as deletion of the C ext ( PA - HnT ) completely eliminated the Vrp1 - HA signal ( Figure 3A ) . To demonstrate that Cmd1 dissocia - tion and not the CaCl 2 treatment per se increased Vrp1 binding , we used myosin and calmodulin mutations that speciﬁcally disrupt the Cmd1 / Myo5 interaction in the ab - sence of calcium : myo5 - iq D and cmd1 - 226 ( Geli et al , 1998 ) . The IQ motifs required for Cmd1 binding ( IQRAWRRFLQR and IQRTIRERKEG ) are deleted in the Myo5 - iq D mutant . The mutant loses its capacity to interact with Cmd1 but , in contrast to the HTC construct , it retains a portion of the Calmodulin regulates Myo5 recruitment and function H Gro¨tsch et al & 2010 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 29 | NO 17 | 2010 2901 neck . The Cmd1 - 226 mutant bears an F92A substitution , which speciﬁcally disrupts the Cmd1 / Myo5 interaction ( Ohya and Botstein , 1994 ; Geli et al , 1998 ) . Consistent with our hypothesis , the cmd1 - 226 mutation signiﬁcantly de - creased association of PA - Myo5 with Cmd1 and concomi - tantly increased binding to Vrp1 , as compared with the wt CMD1 or with the cmd1 - 231 mutation , which does not affect the Myo5 / Cmd1 interaction ( Figure 3B ) ( Geli et al , 1998 ) . The Myo5 - iq D mutant did not bind Cmd1 and it coprecipi - tated signiﬁcant amounts of Vrp1 in the absence or presence of calcium ( Figure 3A ) . However , Myo5 - iq D bound slightly less Vrp1 - HA than the intact calmodulin - stripped Myo5 . The Vrp1 - HA signal appeared 3 ± 0 . 7 - fold increased in the Myo5 - iq D pull downs compared with the Cmd1 - bound Myo5 ( n ¼ 3 ) , whereas calmodulin stripping from the wt Myo5 resulted in a 9 ± 3 . 4 - fold increase of the Vrp1 - HA signal ( n ¼ 3 ) . The result suggested that an intact neck might be required to completely release the nT / C interaction . Deletion of individual IQ motifs did not seem to have a major inﬂuence in Myo5 binding to Vrp1 , suggesting that full activation required dissociation of Cmd1 from both IQ motifs ( Supplementary Figure S2A ) . To investigate whether association of Cmd1 to the myosin neck could inﬂuence the afﬁnity of the nT fragment and the C ext , puriﬁed PA - nTwas incubated with GST fused to the C ext ( GST - C ) , in the presence or absence of 5mM CaCl 2 ( Figure 3C ) . In the presence of 5 mM CaCl 2 Cmd1 dissociated from the nT fragment ( Figure 3C ) ( Geli et al , 1998 ) . Concomi - tantly , the presence of CaCl 2 triggered dissociation of PA - nT from the C ext ( Figure 3C ) . Dissociation of Cmd1 also dis - rupted the interaction between the PA - Hn and PA - HnT fragments and the C ext but did not have an inﬂuence on the PA - HT / C or the PA - HnT - iq D / C interactions ( Supplementary Figure S3A ) . To demonstrate that association of Cmd1 to the myosin neck could reversibly inﬂuence the afﬁnity between the Myo5 fragments , Cmd1 - free PA - nT was incubated with GST - C - coated beads , in the presence or absence of recombinant puriﬁed Cmd1 .

Under the experimental conditions used , no signiﬁcant endocytic defects are observed in the myo5 - iq D and cmd1 - 226 mutants ( Geli et al , 1998 ) and consistently , no signiﬁcant difference in the dynamics of the clathrin - coat component Sla1 - mCherry at cortical patches could be observed for the different mutants , as compared with the isogenic wts ( Table I , SCMIG1079 p GFP - MYO5 versus SCMIG1079 pGFP - myo5 - iq D and SCMIG1077 p GFP - MYO5 ver - sus SCMIG1078 p GFP - MYO5 , mCherry channel ) . In contrast , the lifespan of GFP - Myo5 signiﬁcantly increased in mutants that disrupted the Myo5 / Cmd1 interaction ( GFP - myo5 - iq D and cmd1 - 226 , Table I , GFP channel and Figure 4A and B ) . The average lifespan of GFP - Myo5 in different strain back - grounds expressing the wt Cmd1 was 12 to 13 . 1 s , whereas it was extended up to 19 . 5s in strains where the Myo5 / Cmd1 interaction was disrupted ( Table I , GFP channel and Figure 4A and B ) . A fraction of the GFP - Myo5 cortical patches still exhibited wt dynamics under conditions that disrupted the Myo5 / Cmd1 interaction . However , about 50 % of the patches had lifespans longer than 16s in the cmd1 - 226 mutant ( versus only o 8 % in the isogenic wts ) ( Figure 4C and D ) . Consistent with the observation that an intact neck was required to fully promote binding of Myo5 to Vrp1 , the Myo5 - iq D mutant was slightly less efﬁcient than the cmd1 - 226 mutant in extending the Myo5 lifespan at cortical sites ( Table I , the lifespan of Myo5 - iq D was 14 . 7s , versus 4 15 . 9s for the wt Myo5 in the cmd1 - 226 mutants ) .

Calmodulin regulates Myo5 recruitment and function H Gro¨tsch et al & 2010 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 29 | NO 17 | 2010 2903 the individual IQ motifs or the cmd1 - 231 mutation did not have any signiﬁcant effect on the Myo5 dynamics ( Table I ) . Next , we investigated whether Cmd1 dissociation pro - moted early arrival of Myo5 to the endocytic sites and / or slowed down its dissociation from the PM . For this purpose , we examined the dynamics of long - lived ( lifespan longer than 16s ) GFP - Myo5 patches relative to Sla1 , in the cmd1 - 226 mutant . The lifespan of the Sla1 - mCherry was unaltered in the subpopulation of long - lived GFP - Myo5 patches ( Table II , lifespan Sla1 - mCherry , SCMIG1077 p GFP - MYO5 versus SCMIG1078 p GFP - MYO5 ) . However , the myosin arrived on average 5 . 5s earlier in the cmd1 - 226 mutant , as compared with the CMD1 strain ( Table II , t a GFP - Myo5 and Figure 5 ) . This result indicated that Cmd1 dissociation increased the probability of Myo5 meeting available binding partners at cortical patches . Interestingly also , GFP - Myo5 remained at the PM for a longer time ( 5 . 7s on average ) after departure of the endocytic coat in the cmd1 - 226 mutant ( Table II , t d GFP - Myo5 and Figure 5 ) . This observation suggested that Cmd1 reassociation to Myo5 might contribute to bring back the cortical myosin to the cytosol after vesicle ﬁssion occurs . Cmd1 dissociation from Myo5 triggers actin polymerization in vitro and the assembly of actin at endocytic sites in vivo Vrp1 is required to drive Myo5 - induced actin polymerization ( Geli et al , 2000 ; Lechler et al , 2001 ; Sun et al , 2006 ) . Thus , we next investigated whether Cmd1 might also modulate the capacity of the Myo5 C ext to trigger the assembly of endocytic actin structures . We have previously demonstrated that the Myo5 C ext fused to GST and immobilized on the surface of glutathione - Sepharose beads induces the formation of com - plex actin structures in the presence of yeast extracts ( Geli et al , 2000 ; Idrissi et al , 2002 ) . The actin structures can be labelled with proteins involved in the endocytic uptake and its assembly requires the presence of Vrp1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Geli et al , 2000 ; Idrissi et al , 2002 ) . PA - tagged Myo5 fragments containing either the C ext alone ( PA - C ) or together with either the TH1 domain ( PA - TC ) or the neck and the TH1 domains ( PA - nTC ) were puriﬁed from yeast and immobilized on the surface of IgG - Sepharose beads . Similar to GST - C , PA - C induced assembly of actin structures , which could be visua - lized under the ﬂuorescence microscope using rhodamine - labelled actin ( Figure 6A ) . The structures could be labelled with the endocytic protein Abp1 ( Figure 6A ) , and their formation was dependent on the presence of functional Vrp1 and Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 6B ) . Consistent with the observation that the TH1 domain prevented binding of the C ext to Vrp1 ( Figure 2A ) , the presence of the TH1 domain ( PA - TC ) completely abolished the capacity of the Myo5 C ext to induce the formation of actin patches ( Figure 6C ) . Consistent with the hypothesis that Cmd1 dissociation might regulate this autoinhibitory interaction , we found that the construct bearing the neck ( PA - nTC ) could induce formation of the in vitro generated actin structures , only when it was puriﬁed under conditions that dissociated Cmd1 from the neck ( 5mM CaCl 2 ; Figure 6C ) . The neck was required to promote cal - cium - induced actin polymerization in the presence of the TH1 domain as the CaCl 2 treatment did not alter the actin polymerization promoting capacity of PA - TC ( Figure 6C ) . Finally , actin polymerization induced by Cmd1 dissociation was triggered by the C ext as PA - nT failed to trigger the formation of actin patches under any of the experimental conditions assayed ( Figure 6C ) . Live - cell imaging of Abp1 - RFP in strains bearing myosin - I mutations revealed that these molecular motors , together with Las17 , have an essential function in promoting the assembly of complex actin structures at endocytic sites ( Sun et al , 2006 ; Galletta et al , 2008 ) . To investigate whether Cmd1 dissociation from Myo5 might regulate the assembly of the Abp1 - containing actin structures in vivo , the dynamics of Abp1 - RFP was analysed under conditions that disrupted the Myo5 / Cmd1 interaction .

When considering the subpopulation of GFP - Myo5 patches with lifespans longer than 16s in the cmd1 - 226 mutant , no signiﬁcant differences were observed in the arrival time of GFP - Myo5 relative to Abp1 - RFP , as com - pared with the isogenic wt ( Table III , t a GFP - Myo5 and Figure 7 ) . Abp1 - RFP recruitment closely followed Myo5 recruitment in both strains ( Table III , t a GFP - Myo5 and Figure 7 ) . As Myo5 arrived earlier at the endocytic sites in the cmd1 - 226 mutant ( Table II , t a GFP - Myo5 and Figure 5 ) , the results indicated that Cmd1 dissociation from Myo5 favoured early arrival of Myo5 followed by early onset of actin polymerization . On the other hand , consistent with the observation that Abp1 travels into the cytosol together with the clathrin coat , Myo5 dissociation from the PM was delayed on average 5s after departure of Abp1 - RFP in the cmd1 - 226 strain ( Table III , t d GFP - Myo5 and Figure 7 ; and Table II , t d GFP - Myo5 and Figure 5 ) . Differential binding of cytosolic and PM - associated Myo5 to Cmd1 and Vrp1 Our data indicated that disruption of the Myo5 / Cmd1 inter - action promotes Myo5 binding to Vrp1 , expands the myosin lifespan at cortical patches and activates myosin - I - induced actin polymerization in vitro and in vivo .

If this hypothesis was correct , the PM - associated and cytosolic Myo5 should reciprocally bind Cmd1 and Vrp1 . To test our hypothesis , we prepared cytosolic ( C ) and PM fractions from yeast cells expressing PA - Myo5 and analysed the amount of Cmd1 coprecipitating with the myosin - I in IgG - Sepharose pull downs . The GPI - anchored protein Gas1 and hexokinase ( Hxk1 ) were used as PM and cytosolic markers , respectively ( Figure 8A and C ) . As shown in Figure 8B , the PM - associated Myo5 ( PM ) clearly coprecipitated much less Cmd1 than the cytosolic Myo5 ( C ) . The associated Cmd1 speciﬁcally bound to the Myo5 neck as the signal disappeared when PA - Myo5 - iq D was used instead of the wt ( Figure 8B ) . The lack of association of Myo5 with Cmd1 at the PM was not merely due to the low concentration of Cmd1 in this fraction ( Figure 8A ) , as a 1 to 10 dilution of the cytosol did not alter binding of the cytosolic Myo5 to Cmd1 ( C dil ; Figure 8B ) . We next precipitated PA - Myo5 with IgG - Sepharose from cytosolic and PM fractions of yeast cells expressing Vrp1 - HA ( Figure 8C ) . As shown in Figure 8D , the PM - associated Myo5 ( PM ) coprecipitated much more Vrp1 - HA than the cytosolic myosin ( C ) . Vrp1 speciﬁcally bound to the PM - associated Myo5 as deletion of the C ext ( PA - HnT ) completely eliminated Vrp1 from the precipitates ( Figure 8D ) . The experiments indicated that , compared with the cytosolic Myo5 , the PM - associated Myo5 is poorly bound to Cmd1 but strongly interacts with Vrp1 . Consistent also with previous immuno - localization results ( Brockerhoff and Davis , 1992 ) , which failed to demonstrate the presence of Cmd1 at actin patches , we did not observe colocalization of Cmd1 - mCherry and GFP - Myo5 at endocytic sites in live cells ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) . In contrast , Myo5 and Vrp1 overlap for 10 to 15s at endocytic patches in analogous experiments ( Sun et al , 2006 ) . Discussion On the basis of our observations and the available literature , we propose the model depicted in Figure 9 . According to this model , the cytosolic myosin bound to Cmd1 maintains a closed conformation where the TH1 domain interacts with the C ext preventing association with Vrp1 and Myo5 - induced actin polymerization . At the PM , a still unidentiﬁed mechan - ism releases the tight calmodulin / myosin - I interaction . As a consequence , the intramolecular inhibitory interaction is disrupted , allowing Myo5 binding to Vrp1 and local activa - tion of Myo5 - induced actin polymerization . Finally , Cmd1 reassociation to Myo5 contributes to dissociate it from the PM after vesicle ﬁssion .

Calmodulin regulates Myo5 recruitment and function H Gro¨tsch et al & 2010 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 29 | NO 17 | 2010 2907 Robust evidence for a direct intramolecular interaction between the myosin TH1 domain and the C ext was already present in the literature for the long - tailed protozoal myosins - I . Similar to what we found for Myo5 , pull - down experiments with puriﬁed components demonstrated such interaction for the Acanthamoeba castellanii myosin - IA ( Lee et al , 1999 ) . In addition , structural data on the A . castellanii myosin - IB and C showed a surprising globular structure of the tail , where the SH3 domain folds back on the TH1 domain ( Jontes et al , 1998 ; Ishikawa et al , 2004 ) . More recently , Hwang et al ( 2007 ) have provided NMR data supporting such an intra - molecular interaction . We have now revealed the physiologi - cal signiﬁcance of this interaction and described a molecular mechanism that might contribute to its modulation . We showed that the TH1 domain prevented interaction of the Myo5 C ext with Vrp1 in immunoprecipitation experi - ments . Consistent with the cellular function described for the Myo5 / Vrp1 interaction ( Anderson et al , 1998 ; Geli et al , 2000 ; Lechler et al , 2001 ; Sun et al , 2006 ) , we also found that the TH1 domain impairs recruitment of the Myo5 C ext to cortical patches in vivo and abrogated its activity as an actin polymerization promoting factor in vitro . The TH1 domain most likely exerted its inhibitory activity intramolecularly , as we failed to demonstrate oligomerization of the myosin GFP - Myo5 Abp1 - RFP CMD1 A B GFP - Myo5 Abp1 - RFP cmd1 - 226 Seconds 0 . 00 0 . 20 0 . 40 0 . 60 0 . 80 1 . 00 R F I 0 . 00 0 . 20 0 . 40 0 . 60 0 . 80 1 . 00 R F I 0 . 00 0 . 20 0 . 40 0 . 60 0 . 80 1 . 00 R F I Seconds 0 . 00 0 . 20 0 . 40 0 . 60 0 . 80 1 . 00 R F I GFP - Myo5 Abp1 - RFP CMD1 GFP - Myo5 Abp1 - RFP cmd1 - 226 0 . 00 0 . 20 0 . 40 0 . 60 0 . 80 1 . 00 R F I 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 Seconds Seconds 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 Seconds Seconds 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 0 . 00 0 . 20 0 . 40 0 . 60 0 . 80 1 . 00 R F I t a – t d – t a – t d – t a – t d t a t d t a t d – t a t d Figure 7 Cmd1 dissociation from Myo5 triggers actin assembly at endocytic sites .

Calmodulin regulates Myo5 recruitment and function H Gro¨tsch et al The EMBO Journal VOL 29 | NO 17 | 2010 & 2010 European Molecular Biology Organization 2908 under the same experimental conditions that showed the Myo5 / Vrp1 and Myo5 / Cmd1 interactions ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . An autoinhibitory activity contained within the TH1 do - main was not described before . On the contrary , the TH1 domain has been shown to bind acidic phospholipids ( Adams and Pollard , 1989 ; Hayden et al , 1990 ; Doberstein and Pollard , 1992 ) and to contribute to membrane targeting of different myosins - I ( Miyata et al , 1989 ; Lee et al , 2000 ; Yamashita et al , 2000 ; Oberholzer et al , 2004 ) . The TH1 domain of Myo5 also binds to acidic phospholipids ( data not shown ) and its deletion causes partial mislocalization of the myosin to the cytosol ( Figure 1 ; GFP - HnC ) . Thus , in addition to the autoinhibitory activity , the TH1 domain probably exerts a positive function by recruiting Myo5 to the inner leaﬂet of the PM . On the other hand , our work also revealed that Cmd1 dissociation promoted Myo5 binding to Vrp1 . Again in agree - ment with previously published data on the function of the Myo5 / Vrp1 interaction ( Anderson et al , 1998 ; Geli et al , 2000 ; Lechler et al , 2001 ; Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ; Sun et al , 2006 ) , we found that dissociation of Cmd1 from Myo5 signiﬁcantly extended the myosin lifespan at cortical patches , enhanced actin polymerization at endocytic sites and triggered Myo5 - induced actin polymerization in vitro . Concomitantly , Cmd1 dissociation weakened the interaction between a fragment containing the neck and TH1 domains and the C ext . Considering all the data , it is reasonable to propose that Cmd1 dissociation promotes Myo5 binding to Vrp1 by releas - ing the autoinhibitory interaction between the TH1 domain and the C ext . We made the novel observation that the Cmd1 - bound but not the Cmd1 - stripped Myo5 neck strongly interacts with the C ext and most likely contributes to stabilize the inhibitory α - Gas1 PAP α - Cmd1 α - Hxk1 PA - Myo5 A B C D PA - Myo5 - iq Δ 14 116 α - Gas1 PAP α - HA α - Hxk1 PA - Myo5 PA - HnT 200 97 116 PA - Myo5 I g G - pu ll - do w n PAP α - HA PA - HnT 200 97 PA - Myo5 PA - Myo5 - iq Δ I g G - pu ll - do w n 14 i npu t α - Cmd1 PAP α - Cmd1 14 200 200 PM C C dil PM C T C PM T C PM T PM C T PM C PM C PM C Figure 8 Differential binding of cytosolic and PM - associated Myo5 to Cmd1 and Vrp1 .

Cytosolic Myo5 interacts with Cmd1 , which stabilizes a conformation where the C ext ( C ) folds back and binds to the TH1 ( T ) domain . Under this circum - stance , the SH3 domain is not accessible for binding to Vrp1 . An intracellular signal at the PM causes Cmd1 dissociation from the Myo5 neck and releases the inhibitory interaction . SH3 - mediated binding of Myo5 to Vrp1 concentrates Myo5 at the cortical endocytic patches and triggers Myo5 - induced actin polymerization . Cmd1 reassociation to the Myo5 neck contributes to dissociate it from the PM . Calmodulin regulates Myo5 recruitment and function H Gro¨tsch et al & 2010 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 29 | NO 17 | 2010 2909 interaction between the adjacent TH1 domain and the C ext ( Figure 2C ; Supplementary Figure S3A ) . On the basis of the Myo5 IQ motifs sequences , it appears likely that Cmd1 is bound in an extended conformation ( Terrak et al , 2005 ) , with one lobe free to interact with the C ext . Thus , it is tempting to propose a simple model where Cmd1 works as a clamp that holds the TH1 domain folded onto the C ext . However , our results indicated that the activation mechanism might have a second level of complexity . On the one hand , we failed to detect a direct interaction between free Cmd1 and the C ext ( Supplementary Figure S3B and C ) . This raises the interesting possibility that Cmd1 might need to interact ﬁrst to the Myo5 neck in order to cross - link the nT and C fragments . On the other hand , our results suggested that the presence of an intact neck is important to release the autoinhibitory interac - tion when the TH1 is covalently linked to the C ext . This was inferred from the observation that deletion of the neck in the presence of the TH1 domain completely abolished C ext - dependent recruitment of Myo5 to cortical patches , Myo5 interaction with Vrp1 and Myo5 - induced actin polymeri - zation . Deletion of the neck might cause missfolding of the tail , thereby preventing Vrp1 association . However , this is probably not the case because the HTC construct binds to Rvs167 similar to the wt Myo5 ( Figure 2B ) and partial Trypsin digestion experiments indicated an analogous conformation for the Cmd1 - bound wt Myo5 and for the HTC mutant ( Supplementary Figure S6 , see below ) . Further evidence supporting the active function of the neck in releasing the autoinhibition derives from the Myo5 - iq D mutant . We found that this Myo5 mutant , which lacks a portion of the neck , was less efﬁcient than the cmd1 - 226 mutant in extending the Myo5 lifespan at cortical sites and in promoting Myo5 bind - ing to Vrp1 . Interestingly , a major conformational change induced in the TH1 domain of the short - tailed Brush Border myosin - I can be observed upon calmodulin dissociation from the myosin neck ( Whittaker and Milligan , 1997 ) . We hypothesize that dissociation of Cmd1 could transmit a conformational change from the neck to the TH1 domain , which could inﬂuence its afﬁnity for the C ext . Consistent with this view , we have found that Cmd1 dissociation was accompanied by the exposure of a Trypsin digestion site within the TH1 domain and that exposure of this additional site required the presence of an intact neck ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) . Thus , treatment of the wt Myo5 with 5mM CaCl 2 exposed a Trypsin digestion site that generated an N - terminal 116kDa fragment ( Supplementary Figure S6 , Myo5 Cmd1 , CaCl 2 ) . This fragment was also present after digestion of the wt Myo5 puriﬁed from the cmd1 - 226 mutant , independently of the presence of CaCl 2 ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) . The Trypsin digestion site seemed to be less exposed in the Myo5 - iq D mutant and it could not be detected in the HTC construct , which lacks the complete neck ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) . Alternatively or in addition to a putative con - formational change transmitted from the neck to the TH1 domain , the Cmd1 - stripped neck could bind other molecules that sterically hinder the TH1 / C ext interaction ( Swanljung - Collins and Collins , 1992 ; Cyr et al , 2002 ; Tang et al , 2002 ; Hirono et al , 2004 ; Phillips et al , 2006 ) or it might recruit enzymes that modify the Myo5 tail . Intramolecular interactions regulating protein localization and function of a number of factors that promote actin polymerization have been described before . An interaction between the N - and C - terminus of the mammalian formin formin - related gene in leukocytes a ( FRL a ) modulates its PM localization and actin assembly activity ( Seth et al , 2006 ) . Similarly , induction of Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin poly - merization by the C - terminal portion of neuronal WASP is autoinhibited by the N - terminal fragment ( Rohatgi et al , 2000 ) . Local activation of actin polymerization promoting factors can be achieved by direct interaction with signal transducers such as Cdc42 and PIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which release the autoinhibitory interactions ( Rohatgi et al , 2000 ; Seth et al , 2006 ) . Downregulating futile cycles of actin polymerization might be essential to prevent energy waste and the assembly of actin structures that could interfere with a number of cellular functions . A key question that follows from our work is the nature of the signal triggering Cmd1 release and activation of Myo5 at endocytic sites . Even though increasing evidence points to a function of calcium and calmodulin regulating endocytic uptake in mammals ( Wu et al , 2009 ) , we do not favour the idea that calcium triggers Cmd1 dissociation from Myo5 at endocytic sites because a Cmd1 mutant that does not bind calcium ( cmd1 - 3 ) ( Geiser et al , 1991 ) does not exhibit an uptake defect in yeast ( Kubler et al , 1994 ) . Nevertheless , further experiments would be required to rule out this possibility . On the contrary , a number of results indicate that local production of PIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at endocytic sites could contribute to trigger Cmd1 dissociation from Myo5 . First , it was recently shown that myosin - I mutants exhibit synthetic lethal interactions with mutations in the Mss4 PIns4P - 5 kinase responsible for the production of PIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at endo - cytic sites ( Audhya et al , 2004 ) . Further , the lifespan of Myo5 is signiﬁcantly expanded in a yeast synaptojanin mutant defective in PIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 consumption ( Sun et al , 2007 ) . Finally , Hayden et al ( 1990 ) demonstrated that association of the Brush Border myosin - I with liposomes containing PIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 displaces calmodulin from the myosin neck . In addition , other molecular mechanisms including protein kinase C - dependent phosphorylation of the myosin - I neck and / or actin and nucleotide binding to the motor head ( Lieto - Trivedi and Coluccio , 2008 ) might contribute to lower the tight myosin - I / calmodulin interaction . Further studies will now be required to investigate these possibilities . Materials and methods Strains and genetic techniques Yeast strains used are listed in Table IV .

GST - C and GST were detected by staining with Ponceau red and the PA - Myo5 constructs were detected using PAP . In all , 1 / 125 of the total protein extracts were loaded as input . Puriﬁcation of yeast PM and cytosol The isolation of PM and cytosolic fractions were performed based on ( Serrano , 1988 ) . For further detail see supplementary data . In vitro actin polymerization assay The rhodamine - actin polymerization assay on Sepharose beads was performed as described ( Idrissi et al , 2002 ) except that IgG - Sepharose beads coated with PA - tagged Myo5 constructs puriﬁed from yeast were used instead of the GST construct puriﬁed from E . coli . Fluorescence microscopy Fluorescence micrographs in Figure 1 were obtained with an Axiophot ﬂuorescence microscope ( Zeiss ) equipped with a GFP ﬁlter ( excitation 470 / 40 , LP520 ) and an Olympus DP70 camera . Cells were grown to mid - log phase , harvested , diluted in a small volume of SDC medium and visualized on poly - lysine - coated slides . Rhodamine - actin in the in vitro polymerization assay was observed using a rhodamine ﬁlter ( excitation BP545 / 30 , emission LP590 ) . For the time - lapse ﬂuorescence microscopy , yeast expressing GFP - Myo5 were grown to mid - log phase in SDC medium . Time - lapse videos were collected from cells immobilized in 0 . 8 % low - melt agarose prepared in complete synthetic medium . A Perkin Elmer UltraView ERS Spinning - Disk microscope , equipped with Argon ( 488 , 514nm ) , Argon / Krypton ( 568nm ) and HeNe ( 405 , 440 , 640nm ) Lasers , a 405 / 488 / 568 / 640 Dichroic and a Hamamatsu C9100 - 50 EMCCD camera was used to collect images . A (cid:3) 63 1 . 4NA Oil DIC Plan - Apochromat objective was used for all movies . Time - lapse microscopy images were taken every 2s and were acquired / processed using Volocity from Improvision ( Perkin Elmer ) . Volocity ﬁles were converted to multi - tiff for image processing and to csv for relative intensity ﬂuorescence analysis using Microsoft Excel . Average , standard deviation and P - values for the Student’s t - test were calculated with Microsoft Excel . All images were collected with identical sensitivity and exposure times of 600ms , 500ms and 1s for GFP - Myo5 , Abp1 - RFP and Sla1 - mCherry , respectively . Only bright , well - deﬁned patches were considered for further analysis . For analysis of arrival and departure times of GFP - Myo5 relative to Sla1 - mCherry or Abp1 - RFP , relative ﬂuorescence intensity ( RFI ) curves plotted against time ( s ) were calculated for each pair and the time point when Sla1 - mCherry or Abp1 - RFP reached RFI ¼ 0 . 5 was subtracted from the time point when GFP - Myo5 reached RFI ¼ 0 . 5 either before ( arrival ) or after ( departure ) the time point when Sla1 - mCherry or Abp1 - RFP reached RFI ¼ 1 ( see Figures 5 and 7 ) .
