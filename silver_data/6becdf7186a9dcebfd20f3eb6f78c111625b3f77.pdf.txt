Shu - Ling Peng National Cheng Kung Univeristy , Tainan , Taiwan , ROC Jon - Fan Hu National Cheng Kung Univeristy , Tainan , Taiwan , ROC Abstract : Remote associates problems ( RAP ) have been widely used to measure creative processes . However , studies have rarely explored the RAP processes . The main purpose of this study was to record eye movements while solving RAP . The results show that : ( 1 ) The mean ﬁxation duration increases throughout the problem - solving process , which indicates that more problem solvers encounter impasses . This result supports the “impasse encounter” phase of insight . ( 2 ) During the initial period of problem solving , individuals display more regression counts in the ﬁxation region than in the key region , which supports that the impasses are caused by inappropriate initial representation . ( 3 ) During the middle period of the process , the time individuals spend gazing at the key region increases , while the time spend at the ﬁxation region decreases . This supports the “impasse resolution and insight” phase of insight . 3735
