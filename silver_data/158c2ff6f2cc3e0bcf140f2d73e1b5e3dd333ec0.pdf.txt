Introduction Carefully controlled cell movement is essential for diverse bio - logical events such as embryogenesis , wound healing , and proper brain development , whereas aberrant cell migration underlies numerous pathological states such as inflammatory diseases and cancer metastasis . Directed cell migration requires changes in cell shape powered by dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton . Actin polymerization promotes protrusions at the cell edge ( Mitchison and Cramer , 1996 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Ponti et al . , 2004 ) , whereas actomyosin networks direct cellular contractility to provide traction force for cell body translocation ( Jay et al . , 1995 ; Lauffenburger and Horwitz , 1996 ; Mitchison and Cramer , 1996 ; Ridley et al . , 2003 ; de Rooij et al . , 2005 ; Gupton and Waterman - Storer , 2006 ) . These rearrangements are guided locally by extracellular cues that bind cell surface recep - tors to activate signaling pathways that control the actin cyto - skeletal machinery . Abelson ( Abl ) family kinases , which include the verte - brate Abl / Abl1 and Abl - related gene ( Arg ) / Abl2 proteins , are critical mediators of cytoskeletal rearrangements in response to growth factor or adhesion receptor engagement ( Plattner et al . , 1999 , 2003 , 2004 ; Woodring et al . , 2002 , 2004 ; Hernandez et al . , 2004 ; Miller et al . , 2004 ; Sini et al . , 2004 ; Moresco et al . , 2005 ) . Several studies indicate that Abl family kinases promote local - ized actin network assembly in response to cell – cell or cell – ECM adhesion . For example , Abl family kinases stimulate actin - based cell edge protrusions in fibroblasts ( Woodring et al . , 2002 ; Miller et al . , 2004 ) and neurite branching in neurons ( Woodring et al . , 2002 ; Moresco et al . , 2005 ) as they adhere and spread on ECM molecules . Abl family kinases also promote ac - tin assembly during immune synapse formation between B and T lymphocytes ( Huang et al . , 2008 ) and strengthen F - actin net - works that connect adherens junctions ( Zandy et al . , 2007 ) . Abl family kinases can phosphorylate diverse cytoskeletal effector proteins including the Dok ( downstream of the Tyr kinase ) family adapters ( Cong et al . , 1999 ; Master et al . , 2003 ; Woodring et al . , 2004 ) , Abl - interacting ( Abi ) family proteins ( Dai and Pendergast , 1995 ; Shi et al . , 1995 ; Biesova et al . , 1997 ) , Enabled / mammalian T he molecular mechanisms by which the Abelson ( Abl ) or Abl - related gene ( Arg ) kinases interface with the actin polymerization machinery to promote cell edge protrusions during cell – matrix adhesion are un - clear . In this study , we show that interactions between Arg and the Arp2 / 3 complex regulator cortactin are essential to mediate actin - based cell edge protrusion during fibro - blast adhesion to fibronectin . Arg - deficient and cortactin knockdown fibroblasts exhibit similar defects in adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusion , which can be restored via reexpression of Arg and cortactin . Arg interacts with cort - actin via both binding and catalytic events . The cortactin Src homology ( SH ) 3 domain binds to a Pro - rich motif in the Arg C terminus . Arg mediates adhesion - dependent phosphorylation of cortactin , creating an additional bind - ing site for the Arg SH2 domain . Mutation of residues that mediate Arg – cortactin interactions abrogate the abilities of both proteins to support protrusions , and the Nck adapter , which binds phosphocortactin , is also required . These results demonstrate that interactions between Arg , cortactin , and Nck1 are critical to promote adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusions .

In this study , we ret - rovirally expressed a functional cortactin - RFP fusion protein ( Boyle et al . , 2007 ) in arg  /  + Arg - YFP cells and observed the localization of both proteins in near simultaneous time - lapse imag - ing during fibroblast adhesion and spreading on glass coverslips coated with 10 µg / ml fibronectin . Arg - YFP and cortactin - RFP localize to protrusive lamellar structures at the cell periph - ery ( Fig . 1 , compare B with C [ enlarged in E and F ] ; and Video 1 ) . A portion of cortactin - RFP was also found associated with intracellular vesicular structures , which is consistent with a well - established role for cortactin in endocytosis and vesicle trafficking ( Cao et al . , 2003 ; Merrifield et al . , 2005 ) . Interest - ingly , both Arg - YFP and cortactin - RFP localize to the cell pe - riphery ( Fig . 1 , E and F , arrowheads ) just before the formation of a protrusion ( Fig . 1 , E and F , asterisks ) . We find that in 86 % ( 12 / 14 ) of the cases in which we observed newly formed areas of Arg – cortactin colocalization ( n = 4 cells ) , they were associ - ated with subsequent protrusion . These colocalization experi - ments suggest that Arg and cortactin may interact to promote adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusions . Cortactin knockdown ( KD ) abrogates adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusion Wild - type ( WT ) fibroblasts exhibit frequent dynamic cell edge protrusions as they adhere and spread on fibronectin - coated sur - faces . These protrusions occur much less frequently in arg  /  fibroblasts , a defect which can be repaired by Arg - YFP re - expression ( see Fig . 5 , B – D ; Miller et al . , 2004 ) . Similarly , we used kymography ( Hinz et al . , 1999 ) to determine whether cor - tactin is required for adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusion . During spreading on fibronectin , WT cells or WT cells express - ing an empty short hairpin RNA vector ( WT + vector ) exhibit frequent dynamic protrusions and retractions of the cell edge , yielding kymographs that resemble “rolling hills” ( Fig . 2 , B , C , I , and J ) . In contrast , cortactin KD cells , which retain only 20 % of endogenous cortactin ( Fig . S1 E ) , exhibit a significantly re - duced number of protrusions and retractions ( Fig . 2 D ) , yielding flat , “prairie - like” kymographs . This deficiency was restored via reexpression of a functional RNAi - resistant cortactin mono - meric RFP ( cortactin - RFP ) fusion ( Fig . 2 E ) . These data indi - cate that cortactin , like Arg , is required for dynamic cell edge protrusion during fibroblast adhesion on fibronectin . The cortactin SH3 domain binds to one of several PXXP motifs in Arg We used a bead affinity pull - down assay to characterize the inter - actions between Arg and cortactin . We incubated a constant concentration of cortactin - agarose beads with increasing Arg concentrations . After allowing binding to reach equilibrium , the amount of cortactin - bound Arg or Arg fragments was measured ( Fig . 3 A ) . Arg binds to cortactin and was retained on the beads in a concentration - dependent manner , but only trace amounts of Arg were recovered on the control beads ( Fig . 3 A ) . To identify the domains and motifs that mediate Arg bind - ing to cortactin , we next measured binding affinities of various Arg truncation mutants for cortactin ( Fig . 3 and Fig . S3 ) . Enabled ( Comer et al . , 1998 ; Juang and Hoffmann , 1999 ; Tani et al . , 2003 ) , neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASp ; Burton et al . , 2005 ) , WAVE2 ( Leng et al . , 2005 ; Stuart et al . , 2006 ) , and cortactin ( Boyle et al . , 2007 ) . The molecular mechanisms by which Abl family kinases act through these pro - teins to induce actin polymerization - dependent protrusions are largely unclear . The formation of cell edge protrusions requires actin polymerization nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex or formins ( Pollard , 2007 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex regulator cortactin local - izes to and promotes dynamic actin - rich protrusions of the cell membrane , including circular dorsal ruffles , lamellipodia , and invadopodia ( Weed et al . , 1998 , 2000 ; Bowden et al . , 1999 ; McNiven et al . , 2000 ; Head et al . , 2003 ; Bryce et al . , 2005 ; Boyle et al . , 2007 ) . An N - terminal acidic ( NTA ) region in cor - tactin binds the Arp3 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex and can weakly stimulate F - actin nucleation by this complex ( Weaver et al . , 2002 ) . Cortactin synergizes with N - WASp to stimulate robust F - actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2002 ; Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ; Kowalski et al . , 2005 ) . Cortactin can also stabilize Arp2 / 3 - mediated F - actin branches in vitro ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) , and this activity may be critical for the stability of F - actin – rich cellular protrusions in vivo ( Bryce et al . , 2005 ) . We recently used an unbiased high throughput screen to identify cortactin as an Abl and Arg substrate ( Boyle et al . , 2007 ) . Although other Tyr kinases ( e . g . , Src family kinases ) can also phosphorylate cortactin ( Wu et al . , 1991 ; Thomas et al . , 1995 ; Shah and Vincent , 2005 ) , Abl and Arg are unique in that they also bind stably to cortactin and the cortactin homologue HS1 ( Boyle et al . , 2007 ; Huang et al . , 2008 ) . In the case of HS1 , this interaction is at least partly mediated by binding of the Abl / Arg Src homology ( SH ) 2 domains to Tyr - phosphorylated HS1 ( Huang et al . , 2008 ) . These observations do not resolve how Abl / Arg interface initially with cortactin / HS1 to mediate the phosphorylation required for this binding interaction or what role cortactin phosphorylation plays in actin - based protrusion . In this study , we show that interactions between Arg , cor - tactin , and Nck1 are essential for efficient cell edge protrusion during fibroblast adhesion to fibronectin . We provide evidence that Arg interacts with cortactin via a series of binding and cata - lytic events . Mutations in Arg or cortactin that disrupt these interactions abrogate the ability of these proteins to support ad - hesion - dependent cell edge protrusion . Phosphorylation of cor - tactin reinforces Arg binding to cortactin and helps recruit the Nck1 adapter , which is required for protrusion . These results elucidate the molecular interactions between Arg , cortactin , and Nck1 that promote localized cell edge protrusion during cell – matrix adhesion . Results Arg and cortactin colocalize to adhesion - induced protrusive structures We have previously reexpressed Arg - YFP at endogenous levels in arg  /  fibroblasts ( arg  /  + Arg - YFP cells ) to demonstrate that Arg localizes to and promotes dynamic cell edge protrusions on J une 28 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published May 4 , 2009 505 ARG AND CORTACTIN REGULATE PROTRUSIONS • Lapetina et al . SH3 domain fusion protein binds Arg 557 - C with a similar af - finity as FL cortactin ( K d = 0 . 44 ± 0 . 14 µM ) , but mutation of a key binding residue in the cortactin SH3 domain ( W525A ) eliminates binding of cortactin to Arg 557 - C ( Fig . 3 E and Fig . S3 , E and F ) . Mutation of either all three PXXP motifs or just PXXP1 in Arg 557 - C ( Arg 557 - C mut1 ) disrupts its binding of the cortactin SH3 domain ( Fig . 3 G and Fig . S3 , G and H ) . It is important to note that the PXXP1 motif in Arg ( residues 567 – 576 ) is a tandem array of PXXP motifs ( PXXPXXPXXP ) . Only the central pair of Pro in this motif is conserved in Abl and other Abl family kinases . Mutation of all four Pro in this set ( e . g . , AXXAXXAXXA ) was required to disrupt the ability of Arg 557 - C to bind the cortactin SH3 domain or to support adhesion - dependent protrusions ( Fig . 3 G and Fig . S3 , G and H ; see Fig . 5 I ) . However , mutation of both PXXP2 ( P622A and P625A ) and PXXP3 ( P664A and P667A ; Arg 557 - C mut23 ) leads to only a modest reduction in binding of Arg 557 - C to the cortactin SH3 domain ( K d = 1 . 25 ± 0 . 25 µM ; Fig . 3 G and Fig . S3 I ) . Together , these data indicate that cortactin binds to the Arg PXXP1 motif via its SH3 domain . The Arg N - terminal half containing its SH3 , SH2 , and kinase domains ( Arg  C ) does not bind cortactin ( Fig . 3 C and Fig . S3 B ) . The Arg C - terminal half ( Arg 557 - C ) contains a series of three PXXP motifs located in the linker region between the kinase domain and cytoskeletal - binding domains that could serve as potential binding sites for cortactin’s C - terminal SH3 domain . Arg 557 - C binds to cortactin with submicromolar affinity ( K d = 0 . 85 ± 0 . 18 µM ; Fig . 3 , A – C ) . Although Arg 557 - C binds tightly to cortactin , a slightly smaller Arg fragment ( Arg 688 - C ) lack - ing the PXXP motifs does not bind cortactin ( Fig . 3 C and Fig . S3 D ) . We could not obtain full - length ( FL ) Arg at sufficient concentrations in solution to achieve binding saturation , and , thus , we can only place a lower limit ( K d ≥ 1 . 1 µM ) on this in - teraction ( Fig . 3 C and Fig . S3 A ) . The reduced affinity of Arg for cortactin relative to Arg 557 - C suggests that the Arg N - terminal half may restrict binding of cortactin to the Arg C - terminal half . Collectively , these data suggest that Arg residues 557 – 687 mediate cortactin binding . Cortactin contains a C - terminal SH3 domain that might interact with the PXXP motifs in Arg .

Tyr phosphorylation of cortactin threefold compared with cells held in suspension ( Fig . 4 A ) . Arg is required for this phosphor - ylation , as adhesion to fibronectin does not stimulate cortactin phosphorylation in arg  /  cells ( Fig . 4 B ) or in WT cells treated with the Abl / Arg kinase inhibitor STI - 571 ( Fig . 4 C ) , even though they adhere with similar kinetics to fibronectin - coated on J une 28 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published May 4 , 2009 JCB • VOLUME 185 • NUMBER 3 • 2009 508 Figure 4 .

Adhesion stimulates Tyr phosphor - ylation of cortactin - RFP expressed in cortactin KD cells 2 . 7 - fold , which is a similar induction observed for endogenous cortactin in WT cells ( Fig . 4 , E and F ) . However , the cortactin SH3 domain mutant ( W525A ) , which does not bind Arg , exhib - ited only minimal Tyr phosphorylation , and this was unaffected by adhesion ( Fig . 4 , E and F ) . Together with the data presented in Fig . 3 , these data suggest that interactions between the cor - tactin SH3 domain and Arg PXXP1 are essential for adhesion - dependent phosphorylation of cortactin . SH2 domains bind to phospho - Tyr – containing sequences in target proteins ( Cohen et al . , 1995 ) . We generated phosphor - ylated cortactin ( cortactin - P ) by coexpression of His - tagged cortactin with untagged Arg in insect cells . We next tested whether cortactin - P could bind the Arg SH2 domain . Mem - branes spotted with cortactin - P , a nonphosphorylatable cortac - tin mutant with Phe substitutions at its three phosphorylation sites ( cortactin 3F ) , a positive control of pervanadate - treated cell extract , which is enriched for phospho - Tyr – containing proteins , and a negative control of phosphatase - treated cell ex - tract ( Fig . 4 G ) were probed with a collection of GST - SH2 do - main fusion proteins ( Abl , Arg , and Grb2 ; Fig . 4 H ) . Each of the GST - SH2 domains binds to the pervanadate - treated cell ly - sate positive control , whereas none of the GST - SH2 domains binds to the phosphatase - treated cell lysate negative control ( Fig . 4 H ) . The Arg SH2 domain binds to cortactin - P , but not to cortactin 3F . We next measured the extent to which cortactin phosphor - ylation alters its affinity for Arg . Cortactin phosphorylation does not significantly alter its affinity for the Arg C - terminal half , Arg 557 - C . Cortactin - P binds to Arg 557 - C with an affinity ( K d = 0 . 57 ± 0 . 30 µM ) quite similar to that of cortactin binding to Arg 557 - C ( K d = 0 . 85 ± 0 . 18 µM ; Figs . 3 C and 4 I ) . However , in marked contrast to cortactin , which does not bind the Arg N - terminal half ( Arg  C ; Fig . 3 C ) , cortactin - P binds Arg  C with high affinity ( K d = 0 . 37 ± 0 . 07 µM ; Fig . 4 J ) . This interac - tion is mediated by the Arg SH2 domain , which binds cortactin with similar high affinity ( K d = 0 . 24 ± 0 . 07 µM ; unpublished data ) . Most notably , cortactin - P exhibits a greater than fivefold enhanced binding affinity for FL Arg ( K d = 0 . 21 ± 0 . 05 µM ) compared with cortactin ( K d > 1 . 1 µM ; Figs . 3 C and 4 K ) . To - gether , these experiments indicate that adhesion to fibronectin stimulates Arg - dependent cortactin phosphorylation , which cre - ates a high affinity binding surface for the Arg SH2 domain . Disruption of SH3 - mediated cortactin binding to Arg compromises adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusion The cell edge protrusion defects of arg  /  or cortactin KD cells can be quantitatively restored via reexpression of Arg - YFP ( Miller et al . , 2004 ) or cortactin - RFP ( Fig . 2 E ) , respectively . We used this complementation assay to explore whether Arg – cortactin inter - actions mediate adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusions in vivo . Each mutant was retrovirally expressed at levels similar to WT control cells ( See Fig . S1 and Fig . S2 for quantification and Fig . S2 and Fig . S4 for localization of Arg - YFP and cortactin - RFP fusion proteins ; Miller et al . , 2004 ; Peacock et al . , 2007 ) . Although they localize normally to the cell periphery ( Fig . S1 , A – D ) , cortac - tin mutants lacking the C - terminal SH3 domain (  SH3 ) or con - taining an inactivating point mutation in the SH3 domain ( WA ) that abrogates SH3 - mediated binding to Arg ( Fig . 3 E ) do not sup - port adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusions ( Fig . 2 , G – J ) . These data show that cortactin requires its Arg - binding SH3 domain to support adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusion . An Arg C - terminal half fragment ( Arg 557 - C – YFP ) can restore adhesion - dependent cell edge dynamics to arg  /  cells to 70 % of WT levels ( Fig . 5 G ; Miller et al . , 2004 ) . Interest - ingly , a C - terminal Arg fragment ( Arg 688 - C – YFP ) lacking the three PXXP motifs did not rescue adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusion ( Fig . 5 H ) , even though it undergoes normal adhe - sion - dependent localization to the cell periphery ( Fig . S4 , G and J ; Wang et al . , 2001 ) . Similarly , an Arg 557 - C – YFP mutant in which all Pro residues in the three PXXP motifs were mutated to Ala ( Arg 557 - C PXXP mut123 - YFP ) does not support adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusions ( Fig . S5 ) . Significantly , muta - tion of the first PXXP motif only ( Arg 557 - C PXXP mut1 - YFP ) was sufficient to reduce cell edge protrusions to levels observed in arg  /  + YFP cells ( Fig . 5 I ) . The Arg 557 - C mutant in which only PXXP1 was intact ( Arg 557 - C PXXP mut23 - YFP ) sup - ported adhesion - dependent protrusions to similar levels to Arg 557 - C – YFP ( Fig . 5 J ) . Coupled with the binding experiments presented in Fig . 3 , these data strongly suggest that Arg PXXP1 binding to the cortactin SH3 domain is required for adhesion - dependent cell edge dynamics . Disruption of cortactin phosphorylation reduces cell edge dynamics Having shown that Arg is required for cortactin phosphoryla - tion , which creates a binding site for the Arg SH2 domain , we Phospho - Tyr content of cortactin was normalized to the amount of cortactin immunoprecipitated at each time point .

The cortactin 3F phos - phorylation site mutant rescued cell edge dynamics to only  30 % of the rescue level observed with WT cortactin ( Fig . 2 , F , I , and J ) . The rare protrusions that did form in these cells did not extend as far ( 2 . 0 ± 0 . 3 µM ) as protrusions observed in WT cells ( 2 . 5 ± 0 . 2 µM ) . Similarly , an Arg SH2 domain – binding defective point mutant ( R176K ) could partially restore protru - sion to arg  /  cells ( Fig . 5 , A , F , K , and L ) but only to the in - termediate protrusion levels similar to those observed with Arg 557 - C – YFP . Together with the aforementioned binding experiments , these data demonstrate that cortactin phosphory - lation and its reinforcement of Arg – cortactin binding interac - tions are required to support robust adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusion . Abl can substitute for Arg kinase activity but not for a kinase - independent Arg scaffold function in supporting adhesion - dependent protrusions Surprisingly , when introduced into arg  /  cells , a kinase - inactive ( KI ) catalytic point mutant of Arg ( Arg KI - YFP ) fully restored the protrusion and retraction rate to WT levels ( Fig . 5 E ) . This observation seemed inconsistent with the requirements for Arg in adhesion - dependent cortactin phosphorylation ( Fig . 4 , A – C ) and for cortactin phosphorylation for cell edge protru - sion . We used serum - free conditions in adhesion - dependent phosphorylation assays to isolate the contribution of adhesion receptors . However , in contrast to the serum - free conditions of the adhesion - dependent phosphorylation assays , the cell edge protrusion assays must be performed in complete serum - containing medium to observe robust protrusion activity . We rea - soned that in this context , some other kinase ( e . g . , Abl ) may phosphorylate cortactin to allow cell edge protrusion . In support of this hypothesis , we find that the Abl / Arg inhibitor STI - 571 , which can block adhesion - dependent cortactin phosphorylation ( Fig . 4 C ) , inhibits adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusion ( Fig . 6 , A , B , and D ) . We noted a similar low level of adhesion - dependent cells edge protrusions in abl  /  arg  /  double knock - out ( dko ) mouse fibroblasts expressing YFP ( Fig . 6 , A , B , and E ; Koleske et al . , 1998 ) . Expression of Arg - YFP in dko cells re - stored adhesion - dependent protrusions nearly to levels observed in WT cells , whereas Abl - YFP does not support adhesion - dependent protrusions in dko cells ( Fig . 6 , A , B , F , and H ) . Although Arg KI - YFP could support adhesion - dependent pro - trusions in arg  /  cells ( Fig . 5 , E , K , and L ) , it does not restore adhesion - dependent protrusions to dko cells ( Fig . 6 , A , B , and G ) . These data indicate that Arg provides two functions in support - ing adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusion : a kinase activity that phosphorylates cortactin and a kinase - independent cortactin - binding scaffold function . Abl can substitute its kinase activity for that of Arg , but it is insufficient to supply the scaffold function . A cortactin - Arg fusion protein can rescue protrusion defects in both arg  /  and cortactin KD cells Mutations that disrupt Arg – cortactin interactions compromise the abilities of the respective proteins to support adhesion - dependent protrusions . We reasoned that covalent fusion of other - wise noninteracting Arg and cortactin fragments might restore the ability of these proteins to support protrusions . Like FL Arg , the Arg 688 - C fragment is targeted to the cell periphery via its interactions with F - actin and microtubules . However , because it lacks the PXXP motifs , Arg 688 - C does not bind cortactin ( Fig . 3 C , and Fig . S3 D ) and therefore cannot support adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusion ( Fig . 5 , A , H , K , and L ; Miller et al . , 2004 ) . Similarly , cortactin  SH3 neither binds Arg nor sup - ports protrusions ( Fig . 2 , A , G , I , and J ) . We tested whether fu - sion of these inert moieties could restore at least partial function to either arg  /  or cortactin KD cell types . A cortactin  SH3 – Arg 688 - C – RFP fusion protein was expressed at levels similar to endogenous Arg ( Fig . S2 F ) and localizes to the cell periphery and intracellular vesicles similarly to cortactin ( Fig . S2 , G and H ) . Interestingly , the cortactin  SH3 – Arg 688 - C – RFP fusion pro - tein restored adhesion - dependent protrusions to both arg  /  and cortactin KD cells , even though these levels were only 40 % or 45 % of the levels supported by WT Arg or cortactin , respec - tively ( Fig . 7 , A , B , D , F , and G ) . Importantly , mutations of Tyr 421 , 466 , and 482 in the cortactin portion of the fusion protein ( cortactin 3F  SH3 – Arg 688 - C ) abrogate its ability to rescue protrusions in either cell type ( Fig . 7 , A , C , and E – G ) . These data indicate that interactions between Arg and cortactin are necessary and at least partly sufficient to support protrusions in this context . These findings also further reinforce a model in which Arg acts as a scaffold to mediate downstream cortactin phosphorylation and function in the protrusion process . The cortactin - and Arg - binding protein Nck1 is critical for cell edge protrusions Cortactin phosphorylation enhances Arp2 / 3 complex – mediated actin nucleation in a purified recombinant system by potentiat - ing interactions between cortactin and the Nck1 adapter protein ( Tehrani et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , we also identified Nck1 in a high throughput screen for cortactin - P – binding proteins ( un - published data ) . We tested whether Nck1 is required for adhe - sion - dependent protrusions . Nck1 KD cells , in which > 80 % KD of Nck1 was achieved ( Fig . 8 G ) , exhibited significantly less adhesion - dependent protrusive activity than WT cells ( Fig . 8 , B , D , and E ) . Interestingly , protrusion levels in Nck1 KD cells are lower than those observed in arg  /  and cortactin KD cells . on J une 28 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published May 4 , 2009 JCB • VOLUME 185 • NUMBER 3 • 2009 512 Discussion Abl family kinases act downstream of adhesion receptors to pro - mote actin - based protrusions in a variety of contexts , but the molecular mechanisms by which they interface with the actin polymerization machinery are largely unclear .

Importantly , Nck1 - GFP local - izes with cortactin - RFP to protrusive areas at the cell periphery ( Fig . 8 F ) . These observations suggest that cortactin - P may recruit Nck1 to bridge interactions with the Arp2 / 3 complex during protrusion formation . Figure 6 .

Abl / Arg – cortactin interactions mediate actin assembly in diverse biological contexts We demonstrate that Arg – cortactin interactions promote adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusion . Abl family kinases appear to interact with cortactin to promote actin assembly in a grow - ing number of cellular contexts . For example , we showed previ - ously that Abl - or Arg - mediated cortactin phosphorylation was required for PDGF - induced F - actin – rich circular dorsal ruffles ( Boyle et al . , 2007 ) . Huang et al . ( 2008 ) have shown that Abl interacts with the hematopoietic cortactin homologue HS1 to regulate actin polymerization and lamellipodial spreading at the T cell immunological synapse . Both Abl family kinases and cortactin localize to epithelial adherens junctions where they may similarly interact to promote actin assembly critical to their stability ( Helwani et al . , 2004 ; Zandy et al . , 2007 ; Zandy and that Arg interacts functionally with the Arp2 / 3 complex activator cortactin to promote adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusions . The cortactin SH3 domain binds to a PXXP motif in the Arg C terminus , and both features are required for adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusion formation . Adhesion stimulates Arg to phos - phorylate cortactin , creating a novel high affinity binding site for the Arg SH2 domain and allowing Nck1 recruitment . Disruption of cortactin phosphorylation or Arg binding to phosphocortactin significantly impairs adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusion . Our data indicate that Arg acts as both a cortactin - binding scaf - fold and a cortactin kinase in the protrusion process . Under ap - propriate conditions , Abl can substitute for Arg to phosphorylate cortactin , but it cannot subserve the Arg scaffold function . Together , these data indicate that Arg and cortactin interact via both binding and catalytic events to promote cell edge protrusion during fibroblast adhesion and spreading . Figure 7 .

The binding of cortactin - P to the Arg SH2 domain would be expected to enhance Arg kinase activity by locking it in an active conformation ( Hantschel et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , cortactin binding to Arg could serve as a positive feedback loop for the phosphorylation of additional cortactin molecules or other sub - strates . Our data and work by Tehrani et al . ( 2007 ) suggest that cortactin phosphorylation also recruits the SH2 domain – containing Nck1 adapter protein to regulate actin polymeriza - tion at protrusion sites . Tehrani et al . ( 2007 ) demonstrate that the stimulation of Arp2 / 3 complex – mediated actin nucleation in a purified reconstituted system requires Nck1 . Having identified Nck1 as a cortactin - P – binding protein ( unpublished data ) , in this study , we show that Nck1 colocalizes with cortactin at the cell periphery , where it is required for protrusions . Antibody - induced Nck1 clustering is sufficient to trigger localized actin polymerization ( Rivera et al . , 2004 ) . Nck1 has also been shown to bind the third PXXP motif in Abl to promote filopodial pro - trusion in adhering fibroblasts , and this motif is conserved in Arg ( Antoku et al . , 2008 ) . Together , these data strongly suggest that Nck1 promotes formation of adhesion - dependent protru - sions by serving as a critical reinforcing bridge between Arg , cortactin - P , and other components of the actin polymerization apparatus , most likely N - WASp ( Rohatgi et al . , 2001 ) . Model We propose a model ( Fig . 9 ) for how Arg interacts with cortac - tin to promote adhesion - dependent cell edge protrusion . ( 1 ) Arg localizes to the cell periphery where it uses its PXXP1 motif to bind the cortactin SH3 domain . ( 2 ) Adhesion stimulates Arg ki - nase activity . Arg phosphorylates cortactin , creating an addi - tional high affinity binding site for Arg and possibly other proteins . In the absence of Arg , Abl is also capable of mediating cortactin phosphorylation in response to soluble cues . ( 3a ) Phosphorylation - dependent remodeling of the Arg – cortactin complex allows the SH3 domain of cortactin to interact with N - WASp , stimulating actin polymerization and leading to cell edge protrusion . ( 3b ) As an alternative or in addition , cortactin phosphorylation recruits other SH2 domain – containing proteins such as Nck1 . Nck1’s three SH3 domains bind and activate N - WASp to promote actin polymerization ( Rohatgi et al . , 2001 ; Rivera et al . , 2004 ) , leading to cell edge protrusions . Materials and methods Molecular cloning and purification of recombinant protein Murine Arg and Arg mutant cDNAs were cloned into pFastBac expression vectors ( QIAGEN ) , expressed , and purified as described previously ( Wang et al . , 2001 ) . Murine cortactin and cortactin mutants were expressed and purified as described previously ( Boyle et al . , 2007 ) . Cell culture and retroviral expression WT , arg  /  , and cortactin KD cells were maintained as previously de - scribed ( Miller et al . , 2004 ; Boyle et al . , 2007 ) . Arg KI - YFP and Arg 557 - C – YFP have been previously described ( Miller et al . , 2004 ) . Arg 688 - C – YFP was amplified by PCR from murine Arg using the amino acid numbering system for type IV myristoylated Arg and cloned into N1 - EYFP ( Clontech Laboratories , Inc . ) . The tagged sequence was then subcloned into the ret - roviral expression vector PK1 ( a gift from A . M . Pendergast ; Duke Univer - sity , Durham , NC ) . Arg PXXP point mutants were introduced by PCR and site - directed mutagenesis . For PXXP mut123 , we mutated P567A , P570A , P573A , and P576A ( PXXP1 ) , P622A and P625A ( PXXP2 ) , and P664A In addition to its cortactin - binding PXXP1 motif , the Arg 557 - C fragment contains both F - actin and microtubule - binding do - mains that mediate its proper localization to the cell periphery ( Wang et al . , 2001 ; Miller et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , the Arg C - terminal half serves as both a physical and functional bridge between the F - actin and microtubule cytoskeletons and the actin polym - erization machinery . Does cortactin act as a scaffold for the assembly of actin regulatory complexes ? The cortactin N - terminal half contains the NTA and cortactin repeats that mediate interactions with the Arp2 / 3 complex and F - actin , respectively ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ; for review see Weed and Parsons , 2001 ) . These cortactin features are sufficient to weakly activate the Arp2 / 3 complex and to stabilize the result - ing F - actin branch points ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . Bryce et al . ( 2005 ) have shown that cortactin enhances lamellipodial persistence in human fibrosarcoma cells , and this function requires just the NTA and cortactin repeats . Together , these findings strongly suggest that cortactin’s role in F - actin branch formation / stabilization contributes to overall lamellipo - dial persistence . The cortactin C - terminal half contains additional domains / motifs ( e . g . , phospho - Tyr residues , a Pro - rich region , and an SH3 domain ) that can potentially mediate interactions with sev - eral cytoskeletal effectors , including the Arp2 / 3 activator N - WASp and the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein – interacting protein ( Mizutani et al . , 2002 ; Kinley et al . , 2003 ; for reviews see Weed and Parsons , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2003 ; Daly , 2004 ; Cosen - Binker and Kapus , 2006 ) . In this study , we demonstrate that the cortactin SH3 domain binds Arg . It is unclear how cortactin can use its SH3 domain to interact with both Arg and N - WASp or other proteins simultaneously . One possibility is that initial cortactin SH3 binding to Arg is remodeled to allow subsequent cortactin SH3 domain binding to N - WASp . Alternatively , Arg and N - WASp could bind simultaneously to SH3 domains on different cortactin molecules within the same Arp2 / 3 regulatory complex . A role for cortactin as an actin regulatory scaffold may explain the ability of the C - terminal cortactin fragment lacking the NTA and cortactin repeats to enhance migration of mammary epi - thelial cells ( Kowalski et al . , 2005 ) . Cortactin phosphorylation reinforces Arg – cortactin interactions and may promote recruitment of additional cytoskeletal regulators We also show that the Arg SH2 domain can bind cortactin - P . This binding interaction significantly increases the overall affin - ity of Arg for cortactin by at least fivefold . Mutations that disrupt cortactin phosphorylation or Arg SH2 domain binding reduce protrusions to levels intermediate between WT and arg  /  or cortactin KD cells . Importantly , this protrusion level is similar to those supported by the Arg 557 - C C - terminal fragment . These data suggest that a core Arg – cortactin complex is able to sup - port low level protrusive activity but that Arg - mediated cortac - tin phosphorylation can significantly increase activity of this complex in vivo . on J une 28 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published May 4 , 2009 JCB • VOLUME 185 • NUMBER 3 • 2009 516 Openlab software ( PerkinElmer ) .

( Step 2 ) The kinase activity of Arg is activated upon adhesion . Arg phosphorylates cortactin , cre - ating an additional binding site to the Arg SH2 domain . In the absence of Arg , Abl can phosphorylate cortactin in the presence of soluble growth factors . ( Step 3a ) Cortactin phosphorylation leads to a remodeling of the Arg – cortactin complex , allowing the cortactin SH3 domain to interact with N - WASp . These interactions lead to actin remodeling and pro - trusion formation . ( Step 3b ) Alternatively or in addition , cortactin phosphorylation recruits other SH2 domain – containing proteins such as Nck1 . Nck1 contains three SH3 domains , which can interact with and activate N - WASp to promote actin polymerization .

NaCl , 0 . 01 % NP - 40 , and 5 % glycerol ) and stored as a 50 % slurry . Arg protein was diluted 1 : 3 in a serial fashion ; 20 µl was saved as input sample , and 490 µl of each dilution was added to Eppendorf tubes con - taining 50 µl of cortactin bead slurry or 50 µl of blank bead slurry blocked with an excess of ethanolamine . The reaction was incubated at 4°C while rotating for 2 h . The supernatant was removed , and the beads were rap - idly resuspended with 1 ml of ice - cold binding buffer . Bound material was recovered with 4× Laemmli sample buffer , analyzed on 8 % SDS - PAGE gels , stained with Coomassie blue R - 250 , and scanned using a densitome - ter ( ImageQuant 1 ; Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Intensity levels were adjusted using the auto - adjust feature in Quantity One software ( Bio - Rad Laborato - ries ) . Integrated density measurements were made of the band as well as an empty area of the cell immediately above the band . This background measurement was subtracted from the band density measurement . Binding curves were generated using GraphPad Prism software ( Bio - Rad Laborato - ries ) using the equation Y B X X NS X , d = × + + × max K where Y equals the specific binding signal , X equals the concentration of li - gand added to the cortactin beads , and NS equals the slope of the least - squares linear regression fit for the nonspecific binding as measured with the ethanolamine beads . For representative gels , the Photoshop auto - level function was used , and the gels were cropped to display the bands of in - teraction for each gel . Recombinant cortactin - P was generated by coexpressing His - tagged cortactin with untagged Arg using baculoviral vectors in insect cells . Cell lysates were incubated with nickel beads , and three high salt washes ( 0 . 5 M , 1 . 25 M , 0 . 5 M KCl , respectively ) were used to dislodge cortactin - bound Arg . Cortactin - P was eluted from the nickel column using 200 mM imidaz - ole , and its phosphorylation status was verified via Western blotting with a cocktail of anti – phosphor - Tyr antibodies . Recombinant SH2 domain binding was measured on cortactin af - fixed to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously ( Nollau and Mayer , 2001 ; Machida et al . , 2007 ) . In brief , 0 . 4 µg in 1 µl dots of cor - tactin - P , cortactin 3F , pervanadate - treated cell lysate rich in phosphor - Tyr – containing proteins , or phosphatase - treated cell lysate was spotted in duplicate on a nitrocellulose membrane and allowed to dry overnight at room temperature in a 6 - well culture dish . Membranes were soaked in transfer buffer ( 20 % MeOH , 12 . 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , and 100 mM Gly ) for 30 min , rinsed twice with TBST ( 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , and 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) , and blocked at room temperature for 1 h in TBST with 10 % nonfat milk , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , and 1 mM EDTA . Purified re - combinant GST - SH2 domains of Arg , Abl , and Grb2 conjugated to gluta - thione – horseradish peroxidase were added at a concentration of 1 µg / ml to separate chambers of the 6 - well culture dish and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h with constant orbital rotation . The membranes were then washed three times with TBST for 5 min each , dried , incubated with ECL , and exposed to film . Online supplemental material Fig . S1 shows the expression levels and localization of cortactin or cortactin mutants in cortactin KD cells . Fig . S2 shows the expression levels of Arg and Arg mutants in arg  /  cells . Fig . S3 shows that cor - tactin uses its SH3 domain to bind to the first PXXP region of Arg . Fig . S4 shows that Arg mutants colocalize with F - actin at the cell periphery . Fig . S5 shows that arg  /  cells expressing Arg 557 - C PXXP mut123 have reduced protrusion dynamics . Video 1 shows that Arg - YFP and cortac - tin - RFP colocalize to membrane protrusions in response to adhesion to fi - bronectin .

Expression levels and localization of cortactin or cortactin mutants in cortactin KD cells . ( A – D ) Representative video frames for the localization of FL cortactin – RFP ( A ) , cortactin 3F – RFP ( B ) , cortactin WA – RFP ( C ) , and cortactin D SH3 - RFP ( D ) reexpressed in cortactin KD cells . We carefully selected cells with similar signal intensity for time - lapse videos . ( E ) Quantification of cortactin levels . Cortactin KD resulted in 80 % reduction of cortactin levels relative to pSuper ( pS ) control cells . RNAi - resistant , RFP - tagged cortactin constructs were reexpressed in cortactin KD cells . Note that a significant amount of the RFP tag was clipped during cell lysate preparation ( compare cortactin signal in KD lane 3 with cortactin signal in lanes 3 – 7 ) . The level of cortactin expression of rescue constructs is indicated . Bars , 10 µm . JCB S2 Figure S2 . Expression levels of Arg and Arg mutants in arg 2 / 2 cells . ( A ) 12 . 5 ( first lane ) , 25 ( second lane ) , 50 ( third lane ) , or 100 µg ( fourth lane ) of protein extract from WT cell lysate and the indicated amounts of purified Arg ( fifth through eighth lanes ) were immunoblotted with antibodies against Arg . ( B – D ) 12 . 5 ( first lane ) , 25 ( second lane ) , or 50 µg ( third lane ) of protein extract from arg 2 / 2 cells reconstituted with Arg mutants – YFP and the indicated amounts of purified Arg ( B ) or YFP ( C and D ) were immunoblotted with antibodies against Arg ( B ) or YFP ( C and D ) . ( E ) 12 . 5 ( first lane ) , 25 ( second lane ) , or 50 µg ( third lane ) of protein extract from arg 2 / 2 cells recon - stituted with the cortactin D SH3 – Arg 688 - C – RFP fusion protein and the indicated amounts of purified Arg were immunoblotted with antibodies against Arg . ( F ) Summary of the Arg / Arg mutant expression level in each cell line . A calibration curve of signal intensity versus amount of purified protein was used as standard to estimate the amount of Arg mutant – YFPs / µg of cell extract . ( G and H ) Representative frames of time - lapse videos of arg 2 / 2 cells expressing cortactin D SH3 – Arg 688 C – RFP ( G ) or cortactin 3F D SH3 – Arg 688 - C – RFP ( H ) . Note the localization of the fusion proteins to the cell periphery and intracellular vesicles . Bars , 10 µm . S3 Figure S3 . Cortactin uses its SH3 domain to bind to the first PXXP region of Arg . ( A – I ) Representative SDS - PAGE gels showing binding of Arg and Arg mutants to cortactin beads . Each binding reaction was tested at least twice for nonbinding mutants and at least three times for binding combinations . Plots of concentration ( x axis ) versus the amount bound ( y axis ) were fitted to a rectangular hyperbola binding curve . ( A ) FL Arg binds to cortactin , although saturation was not reached . ( B ) Arg D C does not bind to cortactin . ( C ) Arg 557 - C binds cortactin ( K d = 0 . 85 6 0 . 18 µM ) . ( D ) Arg 688 - C does not bind cortactin . ( E ) Arg 557 - C does not bind to cortactin WA . ( F ) Arg 557 - C binds to the SH3 domain of cortactin ( K d = 0 . 44 6 0 . 14 µM ) . ( G and H ) Arg 557 - C PXXP mut123 and Arg 557 - C PXXP mut1 do not bind appreciably to the cortactin SH3 domain . ( I ) Arg 557 - C PXXP mut23 binds to the cortactin SH3 domain ( K d = 1 . 25 6 0 . 25 µM ) . JCB S4 Figure S4 . Arg mutants colocalize with F - actin at the cell periphery . ( A – R ) arg 2 / 2 cells were infected with the indicated Arg mutants , plated on fibronectin - coated coverslips , and fixed 1 h after plating . F - actin was visualized with Alexa Fluor 350 phalloidin . D – F , J – L , and P – R are enlargements of the boxed areas indicated in C , I , and O , respectively . Bars , 10 µm .
