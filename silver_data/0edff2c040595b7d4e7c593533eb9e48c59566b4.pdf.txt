Casting a semantic graph dataset as an edge - labeled , directed graph , this task can be built on the ability to mine frequent labeled subgraphs in edge - labeled , directed graphs . We begin by considering the enumerative combina - torics of subgraph motif structures in edge - labeled directed graphs . We identify frequent labeled , directed subgraph mo - tif patterns , and measure the signiﬁcance of the resulting motifs by the information gain relative to the expected value of the motif based on the empirical frequency distribution of the link types which compose them , assuming indepen - dence . We illustrate on a small test graph , and discuss re - sults obtained for small linear motifs ( link type bigrams and trigrams ) in the Billion Triple Challenge triplestore . 1 . INTRODUCTION As semantic graph databases ( SGD ) [ 10 ] grow , it is be - coming increasingly important to be able to understand their inherent semantic structure , whether codiﬁed in explicit on - tologies or not . Our research group is developing methods for descriptive semantic analysis of RDF triplestores , to serve purposes of analysis , interpretation , visualization , and optimization . We wish to identify the most prominent se - mantic structures and semantic constraints present in SGDs , ﬁrst simply to understand them , but then to exploit them to provide targeted inferential support , and to optimize search and visualization methods to the speciﬁc ontology , connec - tivity , and distributional statistics of datasets and queries . RDF 1 datasets are sets of triples h s , p , o i , interpreted as ∗ Corresponding author : PNNL / Battelle Suite 400 , 1100 Dexter Ave .

Some predicates indicate semantic meta - data about re - sources , such as their classes C ( s ) , C ( o ) . We have explored statistical representations of the structure of classes and predicates in semantic graph datasets [ 1 , 8 , 9 ] , deﬁning an extant ontology ( EO ) [ 8 ] as a class - predicate network over an entire RDF dataset , edge - weighted by predicate frequency . We also deﬁned ontological scaling [ 1 ] as the ability to “roll up” classes and predicates through an external ontol - ogy to achieve coarser , more meaningful representations . An EO is able to represent the individual link proper - ties among node classes . However , the joint semantic con - straints present amongst link types occurring in combina - tion likely carries much more of the semantic information in a dataset . So we additionally explored the identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant path type structures as vectors of their con - stituent link types , basically link type n - grams [ 8 , 9 ] . We now extend this work to address broader questions in graph data mining [ 4 ] . Methods in both network science and graph mining are aimed almost exclusively at unlabeled graphs , either directed or undirected [ 5 , 11 ] . But seman - tics are exactly carried by the label information in the link types p and classes C ( s ) and C ( o ) , in addition to the direc - tionality of the links ( triples are not generally symmetric ) . It may be valuable to know that two entities are connected by some path , but the exact nature of that path in terms of the intervening link types is critical . Similarly , query in graph databases is modeled as subgraph isomorphism down to matching the node and edge types of the query . We aim to identify signiﬁcant semantic structures by min - ing frequent typed , directed subgraphs as small motifs . We cast the typed link structure of an RDF dataset as an edge - labeled , directed graph , and deﬁne the combinatorial struc - ture of its subgraph motifs . We use the SUBDUE program from Washington State University [ 3 ] 2 to enumerate and count all such motifs . We then use an information gain mea - sure , comparing the empirical frequency of ( edge - labeled , directed ) motifs to their expected frequencies based on the empirical distribution of their sub - motifs , assuming inde - pendence , down to the distribution of the individual edge labels . We illustrate on a small graph , and then show re - sults for bigrams and trigrams of edge labels in paths of the 2 http : / / ailab . wsu . edu / subdue b d s e r 2 6 1 7 8 4 5 c 3 a b d s e r 2 f 6 g 1 f 7 g 8 f 4 g 5 h c 3 f a b d s e r 2 6 1 7 8 4 5 c 3 a b d s e r 2 f 6 g 1 f 7 g 8 f 4 g 5 h c 3 f a Figure 1 : ( Top ) A labeled , directed graph .

ORDERED SETS OF MOTIFS IN LABELED , DIRECTED GRAPHS We model an RDF triplestore as an edge - labeled , directed , connected graph G = h V , E , ψ , L i , where : V is a ﬁnite , non - empty set of nodes , E ⊆ V 2 is a set of directed edges , L is a set of labels and ψ : E → L is a label function mapping each edge (cid:15) ∈ E to a label ψ ( (cid:15) ) . 4 We will say that a graph has size N = | E | with η = | L | edge labels . An example is shown on the top of Fig . 1 , with nodes V = { a , b , c , d , e , r , s } , η = 3 labels L = { f , g , h } , and each of the N = | E | = 8 edges (cid:15) ∈ E identiﬁed in [ [ 8 ] ] , where [ [ x ] ] = { 1 , 2 , . . . , x } , in addition to its label ψ ( (cid:15) ) . G is an edge - labeled , directed graph . If we ignore direc - tion , each directed graph is a member of a class of directed graphs all equivalent to their underlying undirected form created by symmetric closure . This is shown on the center left side of Fig . 1 for G . Alternatively , if we ignore labeling , each labeled graph is a member of a class of labeled graphs all equivalent to their underlying unlabeled form , as shown in the center right side of Fig . 1 . Finally , the unlabeled , undirected form is shown on the bottom of Fig . 1 . We say that H ⊆ G is a subgraph of G if every edge in H is also in G , so that E H ⊆ E G . 5 We restrict ourselves only to connected subgraphs H ⊆ G of the connected graph G . A motif is then a collection of subgraphs which are equivalent by some criteria , and a k - motif is a motif all of whose subgraphs are of size k ≤ N . In this work , we consider motifs which are equivalent by graph structure ( directed or undirected ) , by labeling , and by both labeling and structure . 3 http : / / challenge . semanticweb . org 4 Technically , graphs G used in this paper are also node - labeled , but always with unique labels serving only as identi - ﬁers . We also assume edges are singly - labeled . Extensions to the case where nodes are ( properly ) labeled , and ψ : E → 2 L , so that G is an edge multigraph , can be considered . 5 Note that this edge - based deﬁnition means that it could be that V H = V G even if E H ⊂ E G . Fig . 2 enumerates the unlabeled ( directed and undirected ) motifs of size k = 2 , 3 , 4 . For k = 2 , 3 , all directed motifs are enumerated ; for k = 4 , only those directed motifs present in G are shown . Each directed motif is identiﬁed by a motif number m ∈ [ [ 31 ] ] . Each motif maps to a collection of sub - graphs H ⊆ G ; Fig . 2 also shows the number f ( M ) of those for both the directed and undirected ( unlabeled ) forms . But there are structural relationships between the motifs , in that certain motifs of size k are contained within others of size k + 1 , etc . The unlabeled , undirected case for our example is illustrated in Fig . 3 . Each graph in the diagram represents a motif M , in this case an unlabeled , undirected subgraph of the unlabeled , undirected form of G . Here we can now see more of the frequencies , ranging from just the edge count N = 8 for the single 1 - motif to 1 for the single N - motif ( the original graph ) . The structure in Fig . 3 is a graded partially ordered set ( poset ) , ordered by edge inclusion , ranked by k , and weighted by frequencies f . We recognize the unweighted form as a simplicial complex of subgraphs [ 2 , 6 , 7 ] , restricted to the connected subgraphs . Simplicial complexes are familar as the structure formed by enumerating the k - dimensional hyper - faces of an N - dimensional polytope ( multi - dimensional polygon ) for 1 ∈ [ [ N ] ] . The sub - graphs H ∈ M within each motif are thereby structurally ( homotopically ) equivalent . Fig . 4 illustrates the unlabeled , directed case for k ∈ [ [ 4 ] ] . Note that each motif graph in Fig . 3 now expands to an equivalence class of directed motifs , as identiﬁed in the ﬁg - ure . It can be veriﬁed that the frequencies in the blocks add up to the frequencies for the motifs in Fig . 3 , and indeed Fig . 3 is a sub - poset of Fig . 4 . Consider the motif identiﬁed as M ∗ at the top of Fig . 4 of size k = 3 and frequency f ( M ∗ ) = 3 . This motif alone is expanded to its full labeled , directed form in Fig . 5 , along with its ancestors and descendants for k ∈ [ [ 4 ] ] in the poset of labeled , directed motifs . As before , each motif in Fig . 4 is now expanded to its equivalence class . 3 . MOTIF FREQUENCIES Figure 2 : All motifs for k = 2 , 3 , 4 , both the undirected and directed forms in its equivalence class . For each motif ( undirected or directed ) , the right column shows its count , and for directed motifs the left column shows the motif # m . For k = 4 , only those motifs are shown which are actually present in the graph in Fig . 1 . . . . 15 16(cid:13) 10 1 9 16 3 5 1 8 1 . . . . . . . . . k = 1(cid:13) k = 2(cid:13) k = 3(cid:13) k = 4(cid:13) k = 7(cid:13) k = N = 8(cid:13) 1 1 1 1 Figure 3 : A portion of the unlabeled , undirected motif poset for our example . Edge Label Count p ( l ) l = ψ ( (cid:15) ) f 4 0 . 500 g 3 0 . 375 h 1 0 . 125 Table 1 : Edge label statistics for G . Consider now the motifs of size k = 1 in Fig . 5 . Of course , these are just the individual edge labels f , g , and h with frequencies 2 , 2 , and 1 respectively . Space does not allow showing the full poset for the labeled , directed case , Fig . 5 is restricted to expand only the unlabeled , directed motif M ∗ . Thus the frequencies for the motifs other than those of size k = 3 do not necessarily correspond to those of the classes shown in Fig . 4 , since those also have contributions from its siblings in Fig . 4 . So the frequencies for size k = 1 in Fig . 5 are actually those for the labels of edges which appear within the unlabeled , directed motif M ∗ . Removing this restriction , Table 1 shows the frequency distribution of the edge labels in the whole graph G , along with their relative frequencies p : L → [ 0 , 1 ] , where for l ∈ L , p ( l ) = f ( l ) / N , so that p ( f ) = . 5 , p ( g ) = . 375 , p ( h ) = . 125 . Any edge (cid:15) = h x , y i ∈ E individually maps to the k = 1 unlabeled , directed motif H = h { x , y } , { (cid:15) } i ⊆ G . So just as each edge (cid:15) ∈ E has its label ψ ( (cid:15) ) ∈ L , we seek to extend this concept to describe the motif label ψ ( H ) of a whole subgraph H ⊆ G . For linear motifs , that is , motifs which are just paths , it is suﬃcient to use the vector of edge labels for ψ ( H ) . For example , for the two motifs of type m = 1 in Fig . 5 , we have the vectors ψ ( M ) = h f , g i and ψ ( M ) = h f , h i respectively . In their undirected form , these would be sets ψ ( M ) = { f , g } and ψ ( M ) = { f , h } . But for non - linear motifs , ψ ( H ) needs to be eﬀectively the whole motif graph , indicating both the set of edge labels and their connections . Completion of this aspect awaits further work , but modulo these considerations , we can extend our notion of frequencies of edges p ( l ) = p ( ψ ( (cid:15) ) ) to frequencies of motifs p ( ψ ( H ) ) , or just p ( H ) when clear from context . In particular , all of the directed and undirected motifs H ⊆ G shown in Fig . 2 now break down into their labeled forms . Table 2 shows the frequency distribution p ( ψ ( H ) ) of the undirected motifs for k = 2 , appropriately as sets of edge labels of size k = 2 . In contrast , Table 3 shows the frequency Undirected motif label Count p ( ψ ( H ) ) ψ ( H ) { f , f } 2 0 . 13 { f , g } 7 0 . 47 { f , h } 2 0 . 13 { g , g } 1 0 . 07 { g , h } 3 0 . 20 { h , h } 0 0 . 00 Table 2 : Undirected motif label frequencies , k = 2 . distributions p ( ψ ( H ) | m ) of the three directed motif patterns m = 1 , 2 , 3 for k = 2 , appropriately as ordered pairs . Note the diﬀerences in the columns in Table 3 , as only non - isomorphic pairs are listed . For motif m = 1 , all η 2 = 9 combinations of edge labels are viable . But for motifs m = 2 , 3 , the patterns h f , g i and h g , f i are isomorphic , so that there are only η 2 − (cid:0) η 2 (cid:1) = 6 possibilities . 4 . INFORMATION GAIN OF MOTIFS Now consider a labeled graph motif H ⊆ G , directed or undirected . We can count the frequency p ( H ) as shown above . But we can also estimate how likely H is to occur at random given just the basic distribution p ( l ) over labels . Let ˆ p ( H ) be this estimate of the expected frequency of H ⊆ G . Then for a measure of the information gain of the motif H , we use the standard the logarithmic form − log ( p ) to measure the information content of a probability p 6 = 0 . Noting that p ≥ q → − log ( p ) ≤ − log ( q ) , we posit I ( H ) : = log ( p ( H ) ) − log ( ˆ p ( H ) ) = log p ( H ) ˆ p ( H ) , for both p ( H ) , ˆ p ( H ) 6 = 0 . I ( H ) measures the amount to which p ( H ) occurs above its expectation ˆ p ( H ) , so that then I ( H ) > 0 , and I ( H ) < 0 if it occurs less than expected . To estimate ˆ p ( H ) from p ( l ) for a directed linear motif H ⊆ G , it is suﬃcient to let ˆ p ( H ) = Q (cid:15) ∈ H p ( ψ ( (cid:15) ) ) , where we iterate over each of the edges (cid:15) which compose H . The results for the ﬁrst directed linear motif pattern m = 1 are shown in Table 4 . Note that Table 4 is restricted to only those motifs which occur in the graph . These are all we’re measuring , and this guarantees that p ( H ) , ˆ p ( H ) > 0 . For undirected ( linear ) motifs , calculating ˆ p ( H ) is more complicated . For k = 2 only , let H = { l 1 , l 2 } be the motif la - bel , consisting of its two distinct edge labels l 1 = ψ ( (cid:15) 1 ) , l 2 = Figure 4 : The unlabeled , directed motif poset set for our example for k ∈ [ [ 4 ] ] .

Then we have : ˆ p ( H ) = (cid:26) ( p ( l ) ) 2 , l = l 1 = l 2 2 · p ( l 1 ) · p ( l 2 ) , l 1 6 = l 2 ( 1 ) Table 5 shows the results for undirected motifs for k = 2 . The highest information gain is for the motif { g , h } , since it would be expected to occur 9 . 4 % of the time , when in fact it occurs 20 . 0 % of the time . Similarly , { f , f } is under - represented at 13 . 3 % compared to 25 . 0 % . For k > 2 , ( 1 ) becomes substantially more complicated Consider our target motifs M ∗ 1 , M ∗ 2 again from Fig . 5 , oc - curring with empirical frequencies of p ( H ( M ∗ 1 ) ) = 2 / 3 and p ( H ( M ∗ 2 ) ) = 1 / 3 respectively within their classes . Each is of motif type m = 9 , and is composed of types m = 1 , 2 . For example , M ∗ 1 is the union of m = 2 with label ψ = h f , f i and m = 1 with label ψ = h f , g i . Thus we can posit the estimated expected frequencies ˆ p ( H ( M ∗ 1 ) ) , ˆ p ( H ( M ∗ 2 ) ) as the product of those constituent frequencies , which are shown on Table 3 as ˆ p ( H ( M ∗ 1 ) ) = 1 / 2 · 1 / 3 = 1 / 6 and ˆ p ( H ( M ∗ 2 ) ) = 1 / 12 . The corresponding information gains are then I ( M ∗ 1 ) = log 6 = 0 . 78 , I ( M ∗ 2 ) = log 4 = 0 . 60 . 5 . BILLION TRIPLE CHALLENGE TRIGRAMS We now show information gains for some linear motifs from BTC10 [ 8 , 9 ] , an RDF graph with 1 . 4B unique h s , p , o i triples . Fig . 6 shows the top 16 of the 95 . 2K predicates , comprising 35 % of all 1 . 4B link instances , as shown by the cumulative percentage line . Fig . 7 shows the EO for the top 30 edge labels in BTC10 . For example we have about 70M triples with the predicate foaf : knows connecting subject and object of class foaf : Person , the highest count . Table 6 shows the distribution of the top 20 bigrams of the 1 . 3M consecutive link type pairs , comprising 53 . 0 % of all 17 . 0B consecutive link pairs present ; and Table 7 shows the distribution of the top 20 trigrams of the 72 . 7M consecutive predicate triples , comprising 7 . 54 % of all 1 . 04T link triples . Note that there is a subtle formal diﬀerence between the EO in Fig . 7 and our example in Fig . 1 . Both have node labels which are unique identiﬁers , in the EO these are the classes of resources . Edge labels in the EO are predi - cates . But the EO is additionally weighted by the counts of the edges , basically aggregating multiple edges of the form x f −→ y into one edge with the weight being its count . This would be equivalent to our Fig . 1 being a multi - graph . In any event , there is no diﬀerence once counts are made strictly on link types ( edge labels ) in both structures , these are just two diﬀerent mechanisms to add up counts of link types . Low - frequency predicates are prominent in both the bi - grams and trigrams . For example , consider the most fre - quent bigram h dgtwc : isPartOf , dgtwc : partial _ data i , with a frequency of 17 . 1 % . The constituent predicates have fre - quencies of 0 . 0038 % and 0 . 027 % respectively , far below the top 16 shown in Fig . 6 . If these were independent , the ex - pected joint frequency would be minuscule . For information gains , we have I = 7 . 22 . This pattern of a vast inﬂation of expected probability is a general phenomenon , indicating the powerful role that these small sequence motifs play in the semantics of BTC10 . Table 8 shows information gains for the top 7 link type tri - grams . Note that the third and fourth rows are structurally isomorphic ( trigram motifs h f , g , f i and h g , f , g i have the same decomposition into bigram motifs h f , g i and h g , f i ) , so their counts are combined into the third row of Table 8 . These initial results are insuﬃcient to draw conclusions , but we can see that there is a signiﬁcant variation in I for the diﬀerent trigrams , and a lack of obvious dependence be - tween I ( H ) values and base motif frequency p ( H ) . This is initial justiﬁcation in the value of I ( H ) to indicate additional information not present in the base frequencies . 6 . FURTHER WORK We have shown preliminary results on the use of infor - mation theoretical measures to assess the signiﬁcance of edge - labeled motifs in semantic graph databases . A num - ber of developments await immediate progress beyond this ﬁrst workshop paper : • We recognize that our mathematical objects have been explored in combinatorics and algebraic topology , and we seek results from simplicial complexes which we can bring to bear . We can see I as an objective function in a combinatorial search problem over these posets . In particular , we are interested in exploiting constraint relationships which exist on the frequencies f , p of par - ticular motifs in terms of the frequencies of their chil - dren and parents in the posets . • We also need to extend our understanding of the ex - pressions for the expected frequencies ˆ p ( H ) for non - linear motifs . Simply taking the product of constituents does not completely reﬂect the structural overlap . • Additional interaction between our EO approach and this measurement method is also in order . In par - ticular , in real RDF graphs nodes can have multiple types . Possible approaches then include making our in - put graph node - weighted , or multi - node - labeled . But there could be edges between diﬀerent nodes of the same type participating in diﬀerent motifs in the EO . We may seek to expand the EO to accommodate this , thus counting motifs at the instance level . • Finally , we are straining SUBDUE by using it for new purposes . Additional software development will be very useful , and there is active work underway by our team to scale SUBDUE to giga - scale levels . 7 .
