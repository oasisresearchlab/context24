We previously showed the uptake of anionic liposomes into the atheromas of Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits within lipid pools . However , the cellular distribution of anionic liposomes in atherosclerotic plaque remains undescribed . In addition , how anionic liposomes are absorbed into atherosclerotic plaque is unclear . We investigated the uptake and distribution of anionic liposomes in atherosclerotic plaque in aortic tissues from apolipoprotein E - deficient ( ApoE – / – ) mice . To facilitate the tracking of liposomes , we used liposomes containing fluorescently labeled non - silencing small interfering RNA . Confocal microscopy analysis showed the uptake of anionic liposomes into atherosclerotic plaque and colocalization with macrophages . Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed anionic liposomal accumu - lation in macrophages . To investigate how anionic liposomes cross the local endothelial barrier , we examined the role of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in human coronary artery endothelial cells ( HCAECs ) treated with or without the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - a . Pretreatment with amantadine , an inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , significantly decreased liposomal uptake in HCAECs treated with or without TNF - a by 77 % and 46 % , respectively . Immunoblot analysis showed that endogenous clathrin expression was signifi - cantly increased in HCAECs stimulated with TNF - a but was inhibited by amantadine . These studies indicated that clathrin - mediated endocytosis is partly responsible for the uptake of liposomes by endothelial cells . Our results suggest that anionic liposomes target macrophage - rich areas of vulnerable plaque in ApoE – / – mice ; this finding may lead to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for treating vulnerable plaque in humans . Keywords Atherosclerosis , endocytosis , human coronary artery endothelial cells , macrophage History Received 10 September 2013 Revised 18 October 2013 Accepted 25 October 2013 Published online 20 January 2014 Introduction Atherosclerosis , a chronic inflammatory disease , is the prin - cipal cause of heart attack and stroke and is responsible for 30 % of all deaths in the United States ( Hansson & Libby , 2006 ; Ross , 1993 ; Yusuf et al . , 2001 ) . Atherosclerosis is character - ized as a systemic , progressive disease process in which the arterial wall thickens through a process of inflammation ( Fuster et al . , 2005 ; Granada et al . , 2004 ; Jefferson & Topol , 2005 ; Ross , 1999b ) , oxidative stress and dyslipidemia ( Quinn et al . , 1987 ; Stocker & Keaney , 2004 ; Wang & Bennett , 2012 ) . This process leads to plaque formation and flow limitation in the vessel lumen . Early and intermediate - stage atherosclerotic plaque is characterized by thin fibrous caps , lipid - laden cores , inflammation and endothelial dysfunction ( Libby , 2002 ; Naghavi et al . , 2003 ) . As a result , local vascular permeability increases due to alterations in endothelial cell endocytosis ( Sluimer et al . , 2009 ) , damage to the glycocalyx layer ( Salmon et al . , 2009 ) and the loosening of gap junctions between cells ( Sluimer et al . , 2009 ) . The increase in vascular permeability leads to increases in paracellular transport of macromolecules and endothelial cell endocytosis . Similar alterations of vascular permeability occur during tumor growth in cancers ( Kisseleva et al . , 2006 ) . These increases in vascular and endothelial cell permeability may provide favorable conditions for the localized delivery of therapeutic agents to treat cancer and atherosclerosis . Liposomes have been used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer ( Chang et al . , 2009 ; Mangala et al . , 2009 ) and , to a lesser extent , cardiovascular disease ( Hamilton et al . , 2004 ; Landen et al . , 2005 ; Walton et al . , 2010 ) . Because liposomes can be manipulated , their size and external charge can be specified . The aqueous cores of liposomes have the ability to concentrate hydrophilic compounds for imaging ( Lopez - Berestein , 1987 , 1989 ; Lopez - Berestein et al . , 1984b ) . Liposomes are also considered less toxic than nonbiologic Address for correspondence : Brian L .

Moreover , liposomes have been used success - fully in molecular imaging such as single photon emission computed tomography ( Lopez - Berestein , 1987 , 1989 ; Lopez - Berestein et al . , 1984b ) and as nuclear isotope imaging agents to enhance local tissue imaging ( Lopez - Berestein et al . , 1984a ) . Therefore , if liposomes are capable of targeting select tissues and delivering sufficient quantities for imaging , then their malleable nature may allow for the local delivery of novel therapeutic compounds to atherosclerotic plaque . Liposome uptake by tumors is speculated to be the result of altered vascular permeability ; however , no definitive mechanism has been described . We have previously demon - strated the uptake of anionic liposomes into the atheromas of Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits within lipid pools , suggesting that anionic liposome uptake is associated with areas of metabolically active plaque ( Walton et al . , 2010 ) . Macrophages are the primary metabolically active component of atherosclerotic plaque ( Bhargava & Lee , 2012 ; Feig & Feig , 2012 ) . In addition , the strong negative charge of anionic liposomes may lead to the preferential phagocytosis of these liposomes by macrophages . The uptake of anionic liposomes into atherosclerotic plaque requires that the liposomes cross the local endothelial barrier ; however , the mechanism by which anionic liposomes are absorbed by endothelial cells is not understood . In a previous unpublished study conducted in domestic swine , we found that endothelial dysfunction that results in altered permeability may not alone be sufficient to facilitate the endothelial absorption of anionic liposomes , indicating that most anionic liposome uptake occurs through other pathways . Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) is an essential protein for the transport and metabolism of lipids . The lack of ApoE results in the rapid development of atherosclerotic lesions that are similar to those that occur in human atherosclerosis . The ApoE – / – mouse is a well - validated model for studying human atherosclerosis . These mice , which have a targeted deletion in the ApoE gene , develop severe hypercholester - olemia and atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root and throughout the aorta in a reproducible , time - dependent manner ( Breslow , 1996 ; Nakashima et al . , 1994 ; Piedrahita et al . , 1992 ; Plump et al . , 1992 ; Zaragoza et al . , 2011 ; Zhang et al . , 1992 ) . Importantly , ApoE – / – mice are the only genetically engineered mice that develop extensive athero - sclerotic lesions while consuming a chow diet , and they are the mice in which these lesions have been characterized most thoroughly ( Jawien , 2012 ) . In our study , we investi - gated the uptake and distribution of anionic liposomes in atherosclerotic plaque in aortic tissues from ApoE – / – mice . Furthermore , using human coronary artery endothelial cells ( HCAECs ) , we characterized the mechanism by which anionic liposomes are absorbed by endothelial cells under normal and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF - a ) - stimulated inflammatory conditions . Methods Liposome preparation Liposomes were prepared with 1 , 2 - dimyristoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine and 1 , 2 - dimyristoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - glycerol ( Avanti Polar Lipids , Inc . , Alabaster , AL ) in a 7 : 3 molar ratio . Lipids and a non - silencing small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) sequence tagged with Alexa Fluor 488 dye ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) were mixed in excess tertiary butanol , and Tween 20 was added . This mixture was then lyophilized and stored at (cid:2) 20 (cid:3) C until use . Before in vivo administration , this preparation was hydrated with 1 (cid:4) phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) at a concentration of 50 m g / ml to achieve the desired dose in a 100 m l injection . A non - silencing siRNA sequence tagged with Alexa Fluor 488 ( green ) , which does not share any sequence homology with any known human mRNA sequences , was incorporated into the liposomes and used as a label for the identification and quantification of uptake and distribution in tissues in vivo . Preliminary experiments were performed to determine that liposomal - encapsulated siRNA was efficient for in vivo siRNA delivery , which is consistent with findings from a previous study showing that the possibility of siRNA leakage is very low ( Landen et al . , 2005 ) . Animal procedure and delivery of liposomes ApoE – / – mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) . The animal experimental protocol was performed in compliance with institutional guidelines and was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee ( Permit number : AWC 11 - 069 ) at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston . Eleven ApoE – / – mice ( 9 – 11 weeks old , C57BL / 6 background ) were randomly divided into the control group ( n ¼ 5 ) and test group ( n ¼ 6 ) . The mice were fed a normal chow diet . The mice were anesthetized with 2 % isoflurane and placed in dorsal recumbency . A topical hair removal cream was applied to the femoral area and rinsed off once the hair was removed . Topical lidocaine was applied to the skin over the femoral vein as a vasodilator . A small incision was made to allow visualization of the femoral vein . A slow injection of 100 m L PBS ( control group ) or liposomes ( 5 m g in 100 m L PBS ; test group ) was administered . A small amount of GLUture ( Abbott Laboratories , Abbott Park , IL ) was applied to the incision for closure . While still anesthetized , the mice were euthanized by exsanguination via cardiac puncture 30 or 60 min ( n ¼ 3 per group ) later for the test group and 60 min ( n ¼ 5 ) later for the control group . The aorta of each mouse was collected for immuno - fluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) analyses . Tissue processing and atherosclerotic lesion detection Aortas were divided into two sections . One section was fixed for immunofluorescence staining in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) overnight at 4 (cid:3) C . The tissue was then rinsed in 15 % sucrose for 24 h at 4 (cid:3) C . The plaque tissues were identified , cut into 5 - mm segments , embedded in optimal cutting temperature ( OCT ) compound ( Tissue - Tek ; Sakura Finetek , Torrance , CA ) and stored at (cid:2) 80 (cid:3) C before slides were made . The second section of tissue was fixed for TEM analysis in 3 % glutaraldehyde in PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Slides containing 5 – 8 m m of thin sections of OCT - embedded ApoE – / – mouse aortic tissues were cut with a Leica CM1800 Cryostat ( Leica , Bensheim , Germany ) , placed on Fisherbrand # 15 Superfrost Plus positively charged slides and stored at (cid:2) 80 (cid:3) C overnight .

For assessment of the atherosclerotic lesions , the slides were stained with Oil Red O ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) , and images were observed with an Olympus IX71 brightfield microscope ( Tokyo , Japan ) . Confocal fluorescence microscopy To determine the uptake and distribution of anionic liposomes in atherosclerotic plaque in ApoE – / – mouse aortic tissue , the slides were washed with PBS and counterstained with 4 0 , 6 0 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) nucleic acid stain . Images were observed on a Leica SP5 confocal system with a Leica TCS SP5 II microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Mannheim , Germany ) , DAPI and fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) filters and LAS AF image acquisition software ( Leica Microsystems , Mannheim , Germany ) . For colocalization analysis , the slides were incubated in 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) / 10 % normal goat serum in 0 . 1 % PBS - Tween 20 for 1 h to permeabilize the tissue and block nonspecific protein – protein interactions . The slides were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti - CD68 ( sc - 9139 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ; 1 : 100 dilution ) at 4 (cid:3) C overnight , washed three times with 1 (cid:4) PBS and incubated with anti - rabbit Texas red conjugated secondary antibody ( # 6719 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ; 1 : 1000 dilution ) at room temperature for 60 min . Images were analyzed on a Leica SP5 confocal system with a Leica TCS SP5 II microscope as described above . To quantify the uptake of liposomal siRNA by macrophages relative to that by other cells in athero - sclerotic plaque , we calculated the percent of the ratio of the number of liposomal siRNA puncta that colocalized with macrophages over the total number of liposomal siRNA puncta in plaques . For each group , five random visual fields were analyzed . Transmission electron microscopy To further characterize the distribution of liposomes in atherosclerotic plaque , tissue sections were initially fixed with 3 % glutaraldehyde in PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) and post - fixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide . Dehydration was carried out in a series of graded alcohol washes ( 70 % , 80 % , 90 % and 100 % ethanol ) , followed by two acetone washes . The samples were infiltrated with Epon plastic resin , embedded and cut into 1 m m - thick sections with an RMC MTXL Ultra Microtome ( Boeckeler Instruments , Tucson , AZ ) for low - resolution images . Furthermore , the plaque sections were cut into 60 – 80 nm - thick sections for ultra - structure images . The thin sections were stained for uranyl acetate and lead citrate . Images were acquired with a JEOL JeM - 1230 transmission electron microscope ( JEOL , Tokyo , Japan ) . Cell culture and treatment HCAECs were purchased from Lonza Walkersville , Inc . ( Walkersville , MD ) . Cells were cultured in EBM - 2 ( Lonza ) medium . Liposomes were added to serum - free incubation medium at a final concentration of 150 m g / ml total lipids . To measure liposome uptake , medium was replaced by liposome - containing medium or medium without liposomes ( control ) and incubated for 30 min . In the TNF - a treatment experiment , cells were incubated with TNF - a ( Research and Diagnostic System , 100 ng / ml ) for one hour to analyze clathrin expres - sion . Then , the cells were washed and incubated with liposomes . To evaluate the uptake of liposomes by the clathrin - mediated pathway , cells were pretreated with 1 mM amantadine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 20 min before incubation with TNF - a , as described above . To evaluate the effects of amantadine on clathrin expression , cells treated with TNF - a or pretreated with amantadine followed by TNF - a were incubated with rabbit anti - clathrin primary antibody and anti - rabbit FITC - conjugated secondary antibody ( # 6717 , Abcam , 1 : 1000 dilution ) . The uptake of fluorescent liposomes and clathrin expression were visualized by using a Leica SP5 confocal system with a Leica TCS SP5 II microscope as described above . For the quantitative analysis of fluorescence , cells were trypsinized , resuspended in ice - cold PBS and analyzed by using a BD LSR II flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) with a blue laser ( 488 nm ) . Automated compensation was performed by using FACSDiva Version 6 . 1 . 3 software ( BD BioSciences , San Jose , CA ) . Immunoblotting assay To prepare total cellular extracts , cells were isolated after treatment and sonicated in radioimmunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) solution ( Thermo Scientific , Rockford , IL ) . Protein concentrations were measured by using the BCA protein assay reagent ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . Proteins were separated by using 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electro - phoresis ( 25 m g protein / lane ) and transferred to Immun - Blot PVDF membrane / filter paper ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) , which was then incubated with polyclonal anti - clathrin heavy - chain antibody ( # 2410 , Cell Signaling Technology Inc . , Danvers , MA ) . Subsequently , the blot was incubated with goat anti - rabbit horse radish peroxidase - labeled secondary antibody ( Bio - Rad ) . Proteins were detected by using Pierce enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting substrate . b - Actin ( A1978 , Sigma - Aldrich ) was used as loading control . Statistical analysis Data are representative of three experiments or replicates and are expressed as the mean (cid:5) standard error . Experimental groups were compared by using a Student t test . A p value of less than 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Results Liposomal uptake in atherosclerotic plaque Light microscopy analysis of Oil Red O - stained atheroscler - otic plaque ( Figure 1A ) revealed highly complex lesions . Furthermore , TEM analysis of atherosclerotic plaque showed the presence of foam cells and cholesterol monohydrate crystals ( Figure 1B and C ) . To examine the uptake and distribution of anionic liposomes in atherosclerotic plaque in the aortic tissue of ApoE – / – mice , we performed immuno - fluorescence staining after the injection of PBS ( Figure 2A ) or fluorescently labeled liposomes ( Figure 2B and C ) . At 30 min ( Figure 2B ) and 60 min ( Figure 2C ) after injection , a significant amount of fluorescently labeled liposome was seen in the atherosclerotic plaque of all ApoE – / – mice , whereas no fluorescence was detected in atherosclerotic plaque after the 184 S .

Liposomes were most abundant in lipid - rich areas of atherosclerotic plaque , as demonstrated by the absence of DAPI staining in these regions . Colocalization of macrophages and fluorescently labeled liposomes in atherosclerotic plaque It is generally believed that metabolically active components of atherosclerotic plaque , such as macrophages , preferentially uptake negatively charged particles . To determine whether atherosclerosis - associated macrophages expressing CD68 colocalized with fluorescently labeled liposomes in athero - sclerotic plaque , we performed confocal fluorescence imaging of atherosclerotic plaque in the aortic tissue of ApoE – / – mice . CD68 staining indicated the presence of macrophages in the plaque area , and fluorescently labeled liposomes were visible in the macrophage - rich area of plaque ( Figure 3A and B ) . Fluorescently labeled liposomes and CD68 þ macrophages colocalized primarily in the adventitia lipid - rich areas of plaque ( Figure 3A – C ) . Quantitative analysis showed that approximately 70 % of liposomal siRNA uptake in plaque colocalized with macrophages . To further confirm the distri - bution of anionic liposomes , we conducted TEM analysis . As shown in Figure 3D , liposomes accumulated within macro - phages in atherosclerotic plaque , suggesting an association between liposomal uptake and areas of metabolically active plaque . The role of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in liposome uptake by HCAECs To evaluate whether clathrin - mediated endocytosis is the pathway responsible for the uptake of liposomes by HCAECs , we studied the effects of amantadine , an independent inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Eckels et al . , 2009 ; Luttrell et al . , 1999 ) on liposome uptake in HCAECs . In addition , to examine the effects of amantadine under inflammatory conditions , we treated HCAECs with TNF - a , a key cytokine Figure 1 . Atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE – / – mice .

We first examined the cytotoxicity of amantadine and found that a concentration of 1 mM amantadine was not toxic to HCAECs ( 5 5 % of cell death ; data not shown ) ; thus , this concentration was used in subsequent experiments . Confocal microscopy analysis showed that the uptake of liposomes was greater in HCAECs treated with TNF - a for one hour than in untreated HCAECs ( liposomes only ) ( Figure 4A ) . Importantly , the pretreatment of HCAECs with amantadine reduced the uptake of liposomes in both TNF - a - treated or untreated HCAECs ( Figure 4A ) . The quantification of fluorescently labeled liposomes by flow cytometry ( expressed as the % of viable cells ) showed that the uptake of liposomes by HCAECs was 3 . 5 - fold higher in HCAECs treated with TNF - a for one hour than in untreated HCAECs ( liposomes only ) ( Figure 4B ) . Furthermore , in untreated HCAECs or HCAECs stimulated with TNF - a , pretreatment with amantadine significantly reduced liposome uptake by 46 % and 77 % , respectively ( Figure 4B ) . These results suggest that clathrin - mediated endocytosis is at least partially responsible for the uptake of liposomes by HCAECs . Analysis of clathrin expression in HCAECs We examined whether the TNF - a - induced increase in the uptake of liposomes was mediated by an increase in clathrin expression . Confocal microscopy analysis showed that the basal expression of endogenous clathrin in HCAECs was low ( Figure 5A ) . However , in cells stimulated with TNF - a for one hour , clathrin expression was significantly increased ( Figure 5B ) . Importantly , amantadine greatly inhibited clathrin expression in TNF - a - stimulated cells ( Figure 5C ) . The results of immunoblot analysis were fully consistent with the results of confocal microscopy ( Figure 5D ) . Together , our data Figure 2 .

Discussion In this study , we showed the uptake of anionic liposomes into atherosclerotic plaque in the aortic tissue of ApoE – / – mice and that these liposomes colocalize with and accumulate in macrophages . In addition , we showed that the uptake of anionic liposomes into HCAECs occurs through clathrin - mediated endocytosis .

Thus , our findings suggest that the liposomal drug delivery system may be a promising thera - peutic strategy for targeting the inhibition of macrophage infiltration in atherosclerotic plaque to promote plaque stabilization . In ApoE – / – mice , foam cell lesions develop as early as eight weeks ( Nakashima et al . , 1994 ) . Similarly , we found that atherosclerotic plaque in the aortas of ApoE – / – mice consisted of highly complex lesions and showed evidence of foam cell accumulation . Furthermore , we observed the accumulation of liposomes in macrophages within atherosclerotic plaque , suggesting that the strong negative charge of these liposomes may lead to preferential phagocytosis of the liposomes by macrophages via their scavenger receptors , which is in turn followed by conversion into macrophage - derived foam cells and lipid - rich area . Anionic liposomes have several advantages that positively charged liposomes do not . Namely , positively charged lipo - somes have been shown to be toxic as a carrier and tend to attach to arterial walls ( Filion & Phillips , 1997 ; Lonez et al . , 2008 ) . In contrast , anionic liposomes are passively absorbed through atherosclerotic areas of the arterial wall as a result of altered permeability caused by glycocalyx loss . For liposomes to be taken up into atherosclerotic plaque , they must first cross the local endothelial barrier . Clathrin - and caveolar - mediated endocytosis are the most commonly reported processes of cellular uptake ( Brodsky et al . , 2001 ; Filion & Phillips , 1997 ; Lonez et al . , 2008 ; Mellman , 1996 ; Pelkmans & Helenius , 2002 ) . Clathrin - coated vesicles are the best characterized of the vesicular carriers and provide a specific delivery system for the uptake of extracellular material ( McMahon & Boucrot , 2011 ) . In this study , we showed that the uptake of liposomes into HCAECs was low under normal conditions but was significantly increased in HCAECs stimulated with TNF - a . Furthermore , amantadine , an inde - pendent inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , signifi - cantly inhibited the uptake of liposomes . In addition , our immunoblot analysis showed that the endogenous expression of clathrin was low in HCAECs , but that TNF - a stimulation significantly increased the expression of clathrin ; this increase was inhibited by amantadine . These studies indicate that the clathrin - mediated pathway is at least partially responsible for the endocytosis of liposomes by endothelial cells . Furthermore , these results suggest that the presence of atherosclerosis , including the inflammation response , is essential for the increased uptake of liposomes into athero - sclerotic plaque . However , because the inhibition of endo - cytosis by amantadine was incomplete ( 77 % inhibition in TNF - a - treated HCAECs ) , some liposome uptake may occur through one or more other pathways . Interestingly , our unpublished data showed that the endogenous expression of HCAEC cavelolin - 1 is higher than that of clathrin , suggesting that caveolar - mediated endocytosis may also be involved in the uptake of liposomes by HCAECs . Conclusion Anionic liposomes appear to specifically target the macro - phage - rich area of atherosclerotic plaque in the aortic tissue of ApoE – / – mice .
