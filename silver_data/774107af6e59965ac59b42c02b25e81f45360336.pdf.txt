In the United States , laboratory - confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) is nationally notifiable . However , reported case counts are recognized to be less than the true number of cases because detection and reporting are incomplete and can vary by disease severity , geography , and over time . Methods . To estimate the cumulative incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) infections , symptomatic illnesses , and hospitalizations , we adapted a simple probabilistic multiplier model . Laboratory - confirmed case counts that were reported nationally were adjusted for sources of underdetection based on testing practices in inpatient and outpatient set - tings and assay sensitivity . Results . We estimated that through the end of September , 1 of every 2 . 5 ( 95 % uncertainty interval [ UI ] : 2 . 0 – 3 . 1 ) hospitalized in - fections and 1 of every 7 . 1 ( 95 % UI : 5 . 8 – 9 . 0 ) nonhospitalized illnesses may have been nationally reported . Applying these multipliers to reported SARS - CoV - 2 cases along with data on the prevalence of asymptomatic infection from published systematic reviews , we estimate that 2 . 4 million hospitalizations , 44 . 8 million symptomatic illnesses , and 52 . 9 million total infections may have occurred in the US population from 27 February – 30 September 2020 . Conclusions . These preliminary estimates help demonstrate the societal and healthcare burdens of the COVID - 19 pandemic and can help inform resource allocation and mitigation planning . Keywords . COVID - 19 ; disease burden ; pandemic . In the United States , the earliest known patients with coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , the disease caused by severe acute res - piratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) infection , were associated with travel to affected countries or known contact with other infected persons [ 1 ] . By February 2020 , persons with SARS - CoV - 2 infection in the United States and no known expo - sure were detected [ 2 ] . Between 27 February and 30 September 2020 , nearly 6 . 9 million laboratory - confirmed cases of domesti - cally acquired infections were detected and reported nationally . Persons with laboratory - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection reported through national surveillance do not represent all in - fected persons in the United States . Seroprevalence studies have shown a higher level of SARS - CoV - 2 infection than has been reflected by confirmed case counts [ 3 – 7 ] . Most unreported infections were asymptomatic or mildly ill people who recovered without seeking medical care or testing [ 8 – 10 ] . However , even persons with SARS - CoV - 2 infection in medical settings may not be tested or nationally reported as confirmed cases . Limited availability of tests , reagents , and laboratory capacity reduced case detection ; in addition , patients may have avoided medical care settings or presented with nonspecific symptoms and not been suspected to have SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Furthermore , not all infected persons will test positive because of assay sensi - tivity , timing of specimen collection , or specimen quality [ 11 ] . Factors involved in detecting and reporting cases may vary by age , geographically , over time , across healthcare settings , and by severity of disease . Finally , some people may be infected with SARS - CoV - 2 and never show clinical symptoms ; these asymp - tomatic persons would be even less likely to be detected [ 9 , 10 ] . To better estimate the US incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion since the beginning of the pandemic , we adapted a proba - bilistic multiplier model to adjust nationally reported counts of confirmed cases for various sources of underdetection [ 12 ] ; this model estimates total SARS - CoV - 2 infections , symptomatic illnesses , and hospitalized patients in the US population from 27 February 2020 to 30 September 2020 .

The NNDSS uses a standardized case report form , in - cluding state of residence , age , hospitalization admission , and other demographic and clinical characteristics . Given data entry delays and incomplete national reporting , jurisdictions reported aggregated counts daily for the previous day . Probable , asymptomatic , and travel - associated cases were excluded from counts of confirmed cases used in this analysis . Analytic Methods We applied a probabilistic multiplier model to adjust the reported numbers of confirmed symptomatic cases for factors affecting detection of persons with SARS - CoV - 2 infection , a method pre - viously used to estimate the incidence of H1N1pdm09 during the 2009 influenza pandemic [ 12 ] . This method uses confirmed cases and data on case detection and the asymptomatic fraction to estimate the cumulative number of hospitalized patients with SARS - CoV - 2 infection , the total number with symptomatic ill - ness , and the total number of infected persons ( Figure 1 ) . To account for variability in detection of SARS - CoV - 2 we strat - ified reported cases into hospitalized and nonhospitalized symp - tomatic cases , and further by age group ( 0 – 4 years , 5 – 17 years , 18 – 49 years , 50 – 64 years , ≥ 65 years ) , time period when the case was reported ( February – March , April – May , June – July , August – September ) , and US Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) region [ 15 ] . Age group was imputed for cases with missing birth date according to the age distribution within each HHS region and reporting time period . If hospitalization status was missing , we imputed the percentage of patients who were hospitalized based on reported cases with complete data by age group , HHS region , and reporting time period . More details on this process are available in the Supplementary Methods . We adjusted case counts for 3 factors that affected national case detection of symptomatic cases : if a patient is symptomatic , they may not have sought medical attention or testing for their illness ( parameter C ) ; if a patient sought medical care , they may not have had a SARS - CoV - 2 test completed ( parameter B ) ; or if a patient was tested , the SARS - CoV - 2 assay used may result in a false - negative result due to its sensitivity to detect SARS - CoV - 2 in the specimen ( parameter A ) . We used several data sources to describe these factors ( Table 1 ) , with underdetection multi - pliers calculated as an inverse of the product of factors A – C . Each multiplier was calculated within strata of hospitalization status , age group , and reporting time period , as data were avail - able , and applied to the relevant stratified cases counts to esti - mate the number of symptomatic cases within that strata . After adjustment , we summed the strata to a number of es - timated symptomatic cases and applied one more source of underdetection—a person infected with SARS - CoV - 2 may never show clinical symptoms ( parameter D ) —to estimate the number of total infections in the population .

Population rates were estimated using bridged - race population estimates from CDC Wonder [ 18 ] . Analyses were completed in R ( version 3 . 6 . 1 ; R Foundation for Statistical Computing ) . Sources of Underdetection of Cases Parameter A . SARS - CoV - 2 Assay Sensitivity Patients infected with SARS - CoV - 2 may not always test positive . Sensitivity of approved molecular diagnostic assays may be af - fected by the limits of detection of specific assays , specimen quality , source , handling , and timing of collection [ 11 ] . In a systematic review , 2 % – 21 % of patients ultimately confirmed to have SARS - CoV - 2 infection did not have a positive result unless multiple tests were performed over several days [ 16 ] . This review was used to estimate the probability that a specimen with SARS - CoV - 2 will test positive ( Table 1 ) . For simplicity , since reported assay specificity has been high with false - positive results ranging between 1 % and 4 % [ 19 , 20 ] , we did not adjust for potential false positives . Parameter B . SARS - CoV - 2 Assay Ordered and Test Completed Patients with SARS - CoV - 2 infection who are not tested with molecular assays are not included in confirmed case counts . To characterize testing probabilities , we used data from 2 sources on healthcare visits and SARS - CoV - 2 testing , and estimated this pa - rameter separately for hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients . To capture the variability in testing practices across data sources , we represented this parameter using a beta PERT distribution centered on the median value and ranging between the min - imum and maximum values reported across both data sources within each stratum of age ( Table 1 ) . The beta PERT distribution is a continuous probability distribution , which emphasizes the most likely values in an acceptable range of parameter values ( ie , more often drawing closer to the middle value of the interval with a smaller probability on the extremes of the interval ) . The first source of data was the IBM Watson Health Explorys electronic health record ( EHR ) database ( IBM Corporation , Armonk , NY ) , which includes more than 39 health system part - ners across the country . We identified visits with an International Classification of Diseases , 10th revision ( ICD - 10 ) , diagnosis or Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms ( SNOMED ) code that indicated an acute respiratory illness ( ARI ) ( Supplementary Table 7 ) and the number of those with evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 test results from Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes ( LOINC ) codes for SARS - CoV - 2 reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) tests ( Supplementary Table 8 ) . For each setting ( inpatient , outpatient , emergency department ) , visits and tests performed were aggre - gated into strata for time period and age group . We also included rates of testing in the COVID Near You ( CNY ) survey platform . CNY is a website application where participants can self - report symptoms , healthcare - seeking behaviors , and SARS - CoV - 2 testing information [ 21 – 23 ] . COVID - like illness ( CLI ) was defined using self - reported presence of shortness of breath or cough or 2 or more of self - reported fever , chills , sore throat , body ache , headache , or loss of taste or smell . Proportions of individuals who self - reported receiving a SARS - CoV - 2 test among those who sought care for CLI were estimated for each time period with available data by HHS region and age group ( Table 1 , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Parameter C . Symptomatic Patient Seeks Care / Testing A symptomatic person with SARS - CoV - 2 infection will not be included in confirmed case counts if they never sought medical Table 1 .

To estimate healthcare seeking , we used data obtained from both CNY and Flu Near You ( FNY ) [ 24 ] , which has conducted participatory surveillance for influenza - like illnesses since 2011 , to better capture the full time period and differences between participants of the 2 sys - tems . We considered a range of symptomatic illness including the following : ( 1 ) CLI as described above , but excluding loss of taste or smell for FNY , which was not captured in that platform ; ( 2 ) a more specific case definition of fever , and either cough or shortness of breath ; and ( 3 ) a broader case definition of at least 1 of fever , cough , or shortness of breath . Among patients who met the given case definition , we calculated the proportion who reported visiting a doctor’s office , urgent care clinic , out - patient clinic , emergency department , testing center , telemed - icine , or other healthcare setting for symptoms . Care - seeking proportions were included using a beta PERT distribution of the median and range of values across the 3 case definitions and 2 data sources , stratified by report date and age group ( Table 1 , Supplementary Table 2 ) . Parameter D . Patient Is Symptomatic if Infected With SARS - CoV - 2 Some people infected with SARS - CoV - 2 do not experience symptoms [ 25 ] . To estimate the number of infections in the population , we adjusted the sum of hospitalized and sympto - matic nonhospitalized cases based on the proportion of persons with confirmed COVID - 19 and no symptoms from a meta - analysis of available literature ( Table 1 ) [ 17 ] . RESULTS National Case Reporting During 27 February – 30 September 2020 , there were 6 891 764 confirmed cases of symptomatic COVID - 19 acquired domes - tically and reported nationally through individual or aggregate case counts . We estimated that approximately 14 % of these pa - tients had been hospitalized , with variation by age group , case report date , and HHS region ( Table 2 ) . Hospitalized Cases We estimated 2 . 5 ( 95 % UI : 2 . 0 – 3 . 1 ) SARS - CoV - 2 hospitaliza - tions in the population for each hospitalized case reported na - tionally , with variations by age group , HHS region , and report date . Underdetection multipliers decreased over time and were consistently highest among children ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Adjusting case counts by HHS region , age group , and report date , we estimated a total of 2 397 777 ( 95 % UI : 2 053 156 – 2 855 843 ) hospitalizations with SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( Table 3 ) , or 733 hospitalizations per 100 000 population . The highest rates of hospitalization were among patients aged 65 years and older ( 1950 / 100 000 ) and lowest among children 5 – 17 years of age ( 83 / 100 000 ) . Estimates varied geographically : 236 per 100 000 in HHS region 10 to 2440 per 100 000 in HHS region 2 . Nonhospitalized Symptomatic Illnesses We estimated 7 . 1 ( 95 % UI : 5 . 8 – 9 . 0 ) nonhospitalized symp - tomatic illnesses for every 1 nonhospitalized case reported Table 2 .

This indicates that 1 in 7 . 7 , or 13 % , of total infections were identified and reported . Detection varied by age , with lower detection rates among chil - dren , but with improvements over time ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . DISCUSSION We estimated that nearly 53 million SARS - CoV - 2 infections , including 45 million symptomatic illnesses and 2 . 4 million associated hospitalizations , may have occurred in the United States through 30 September 2020 , with variation by geographic region , age group , and time . These preliminary estimates dem - onstrate the large incidence of disease in the US population and better quantify the impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic on the healthcare system and society , and will be updated as more data on underdetection become available . From past experiences with influenza [ 26 ] , another respira - tory virus associated with a large proportion of mild illness and an overlapping clinical syndrome with COVID - 19 , laboratory - confirmed cases reported through surveillance systems un - derestimate total infections . We adapted our current approach from methods to estimate the influenza A / H1N1pdm09 preva - lence in the United States during the 2009 pandemic [ 12 ] . Our preliminary estimates indicate approximately 1 in 8 , or 13 % , of total SARS - CoV - 2 infections were recognized and reported through the end of September . Similarly , a recent serologic survey of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in 10 geographically diverse US sites from 23 March to 12 May of 2020 estimated that the total number of SARS - CoV - 2 infections was at least 10 ( range by US site : 6 – 24 ) for every reported case [ 3 ] , with improvements in this ratio by later time points . Severe cases were more likely to be detected and reported ; we estimated 2 . 5 hospitalized patients for each hospitalized case reported . In the Explorys EHR data , the proportion of intensive care unit patients tested for SARS - CoV - 2 was more than 90 % by the end of September , although testing remained lower among other inpatients with ARI , and even lower for ARI visits in outpatient settings ( Supplementary Figure 1 , Supplementary Table 6 ) . For comparison , the COVID - 19 – associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network ( COVID - NET ) is an active , population - based surveillance system for laboratory - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 – associated hospitalizations in defined areas of 14 states [ 27 ] . While direct comparisons with COVID - NET are imperfect due to the narrower geographic area of the surveillance sites , in 10 of the 14 sites our estimated hospitalization rates by region were 1 . 5 – 3 . 5 times higher than the reported rates from individual sites within those regions by the end of September , similar to the range of our estimated underdetection multiplier for confirmed hospi - talizations . Likewise , COVID - NET showed similar trends across age ; adults aged 65 years and older had 5 – 6 times higher rates of hospitalizations than younger adults aged 18 – 49 years [ 28 ] . Both also showed lower hospitalization rates among children [ 29 , 30 ] . Table 5 .

This is higher than seroprevalence esti - mates from a nationwide commercial laboratory seroprevalence survey , which found that 1 % – 22 % of various state populations had antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 by early August , although our estimates include 2 more months of circulation [ 31 ] . There re - main uncertainties in the interpretation of seroprevalence esti - mates , including how they vary by the population surveyed , the serologic assays used , the proportion of infected cases with a detectable antibody response , and how long antibody detection persists after infection . Additional studies and sources of data on population - based incidence will help resolve these concerns and provide better national estimates of illness and infection . We recognize that our model has limitations . From almost a decade of monitoring data on testing practices for influenza [ 32 , 33 ] , testing rates and the use of more sensitive molecular testing have varied by jurisdictions , care settings , age , and di - sease severity [ 34 ] . The availability and use of testing for SARS - CoV - 2 have changed rapidly over time ; thus far , data on the proportion of persons who are tested for COVID - 19 and how this varies across all the previously described factors remain limited . Although data on testing by time , healthcare setting , and age were available , they lacked the coverage to allow for geographic - specific model inputs . These data limitations could have resulted in overestimation of cases from areas with higher testing rates , including some hospitals that are performing uni - versal testing or have more outpatient testing facilities and ac - tive contact tracing . Likewise , we may have underestimated in areas with lower testing and contact tracing . Additionally , some infections , such as those among healthcare workers or from outbreaks in congregate residential settings , may be more likely to be tested and nationally reported compared with the general population , and could overestimate nonhospitalized cases and infections . We continue to seek information on the propor - tion of cases and testing rates in various settings to improve estimates . With limited but growing information regarding the spectrum of clinical manifestations from SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion , there could be a lower index of suspicion of COVID - 19 for patients who present with nonspecific and nonrespiratory symptoms ; these cases may be less likely to be detected and re - ported . All of this highlights the importance of having data to monitor the proportions of patients with different clinical syn - dromes who are being tested for SARS - CoV - 2 infection in a va - riety of healthcare and geographic settings , and not just total numbers of tests performed . Finally , in some heavily affected areas , the size of the outbreaks exceeded capacities to com - plete detailed case reporting , including patient age and hospi - talization status . For cases with missing hospitalization status , we imputed the proportion of reported cases who were hospi - talized from the subset with complete data , but it is unclear if age and hospitalization status were missing at random [ 35 ] . If not random , and the data were more complete for hospitalized patients , the true hospitalization rate would be lower than we imputed , and the number of hospitalized cases would be lower than we estimated . Furthermore , this was hospitalization status at the time of the case report and would miss those diagnosed as an outpatient but who became hospitalized after they were reported as a case ; thus , our estimates of hospitalization may be an underestimate . Despite these limitations , our model provides a relatively simple approach to illustrate why there are more persons who have had a SARS - CoV - 2 infection than the reported confirmed case counts at multiple levels of disease severity . We used data currently available to provide a preliminary estimate of the overall incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection , illness , and hos - pitalization in the United States . The CDC is actively working on refining methods to synthesize information across multiple data sources to better describe the national burden of SARS - CoV - 2 infection on an ongoing basis and will update estimates as data become available . In summary , we estimated that in the United States through 30 September 2020 there were approximately 53 million total SARS - CoV - 2 infections , including 45 million symptomatic illnesses and 2 . 4 million hospitalizations , with large variations by age group and geographic area . This indicates that approximately 84 % of the US population has not yet been infected and thus most of the country remains at risk , despite already high rates of hospitali - zation . Improved estimates of SARS - CoV - 2 infections , sympto - matic illnesses , and hospitalizations over time are critical to our understanding of the severity and burden of this new virus .
