This course is justiﬁed by the requirements of emerging technological and medical approaches attempting to effectively interact with central nervous system cells , as in the case of brain - machine interfaces or neuroprosthetic . In that regard , the remarkable cytocompatibility and ease of chemical functionalization characterizing surface - immobilized graphene - based nanomaterials ( GBNs ) make them increasingly appealing for these purposes . Here , we compared the ( morpho ) mechanical and functional adaptation of rat primary hippocampal neurons when interfaced with surfaces covered with pristine single - layer graphene ( pSLG ) and phenylacetic acid - functionalized single - layer graphene ( fSLG ) . Our results conﬁrmed the intrinsic ability of glass - supported single - layer graphene to boost neuronal activity highlighting , conversely , the downturn inducible by the surface insertion of phenylacetic acid moieties . fSLG - interfaced neurons showed a signiﬁcant reduction in spontaneous postsynaptic currents ( PSCs ) , coupled to reduced cell stiffness and altered focal adhesion organization compared to control samples . Overall , we have here demonstrated that graphene substrates , both pristine and functionalized , could be alternatively used to intrinsically promote or depress neuronal activity in primary hippocampal cultures . Keywords : hippocampal neurons , graphene , chemical functionalization , synaptic activity , cell stiffness INTRODUCTION Graphene is an atomically - thin carbon - based nanomaterial currently exploited in many research ﬁelds ( Randviir et al . , 2014 ) , as well as industrial sectors ( Zhou et al . , 2011 ; Torrisi et al . , 2012 ) , including advanced biomedical applications ( Ryoo et al . , 2010 ; Nayak et al . , 2011 ; Zhang et al . , 2011 ; Reina et al . , 2017 ) . In regard to the latter application , graphene unusual physicochemical properties , Frontiers in Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 1 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 811348 fnins - 15 - 811348 January 11 , 2022 Time : 10 : 24 # 2 Zummo et al . Graphene - Based Neuromodulation such as its high carrier mobility , optical transparency and ease of chemical functionalization , open to novel approaches in the design and fabrication of advanced neuronal tools as , for example , implanted brain sensors , smart stimulation electrodes or neuroprosthetic devices ( Lu et al . , 2016 ; Shin et al . , 2016 ; Franceschi Biagioni et al . , 2021 ) . In this framework , the possibility to layer graphene on virtually every surface and its ease of chemical functionalization ( Xu et al . , 2016 ) , drastically expands material capabilities making it possible , for example , to design devices able to tune cellular adhesion ( Jeong et al . , 2016 ) , reduce inﬂammatory responses ( Zhou et al . , 2016 ) , or introduce chemical moieties ( Karki et al . , 2020 ) . Among all chemical functionalization able to alter surface physicochemical properties , the amino ( - NH 2 ) and carboxyl groups ( - COOH ) have demonstrated to induce cell adhesion and promote cell growth ( Keselowsky et al . , 2004 ; Ren et al . , 2009 ; Deng et al . , 2015 ) , presumably through an improved cell wettability associated with surface charging and protein adsorption ( Arima and Iwata , 2007 ) . Unfortunately , despite hopes raised by recent development in graphene applications , the understanding of its functional interactions with brain tissue when chemically functionalized is still limited , particularly concerning the synergic eﬀect of chemical moieties and graphene eﬀect on neuronal excitability . Indeed , glass - supported single - layer graphene has demonstrated an intrinsic ability to induce a boost in the electrical activity of interfaced neuronal cells ( Tang et al . , 2013 ; Kitko et al . , 2018 ; Pampaloni et al . , 2018a ) . This eﬀect has been reconducted to the ability of graphene to perturb the distribution of extracellular ions at the interface with neurons giving rise to altered ion currents , associated with increased ﬁring rate . Apparently , the graphene – ion interactions responsible for the eﬀect occur when single - layer graphene is laid on electrically insulating substrates but vanish on electrically conductive ones ( Pampaloni et al . , 2018b ) . Other studies reconducted graphene - induced neurotransmission potentiation to an alteration in cholesterol homeostasis impacting the number , release probability , and recycling rate of synaptic vesicles ( Kitko et al . , 2018 ) . A common aspect of all these studies is the validation of the possibility to potentiate the spontaneous electrical activity of a neuronal network simply by facing it with graphene . This remarkable result allows the possible use of the material for neuromodulation . However , the limitation to induce only network excitation limits the eﬀectiveness of neuromodulation due to the lack of the ability to downregulate the electrical activity . In the present study , we attempted to respond to this need by culturing primary neurons from rat hippocampus above glass - supported pristine single - layer graphene ( pSLG ) and phenylacetic acid functionalized graphene ( fSLG ) , comparing their properties to those of cells plated on bare glass controls . The carboxyl group conveyed by the phenylacetic acid surface insertion , in particular , has already been demonstrated to allow eﬀective cell attachment and development with a very mild eﬀect on cell vitality and functionality ( Lee et al . , 2006 ; Ren et al . , 2009 ) . Indeed , this chemical group represents a valuable validation molecule to investigate the impact of chemical functionalization on graphene . We aimed at disclosing the synergic eﬀect of graphene and chemical groups on neuronal network development focusing , in particular , on its impact on neuronal cell electrical and biomechanical properties . To pursue the investigation , we directly plated cells on graphene substrates and evaluated network morphology and composition by immunoﬂuorescence , electrical activity by patch - clamping recordings , and cell stiﬀness by Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) force - spectroscopy experiments . MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of Single - Layer Graphene Substrates Single - layer graphene ( SLG ) was grown by chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) on ﬂat Cu foils and subsequently transferred onto supporting glass substrates . In brief , graphene was produced using a Black MagicPro 4 " reactor on a 25 µ m thick copper foil ( 99 . 8 % metal basis , Alfa Aesar , United Kingdom ) . Before the CVD process , copper foils were cut in 6 cm 2 × 5 cm 2 samples , cleaned in acetic acid and acetone , and ﬁnally rinsed in isopropyl alcohol ( IPA ) . The two - steps growth process consisted of a 10 min Cu surface reduction at 1 , 000 ◦ C by ﬂowing 400 standard cubic centimeters per minute ( sccm ) of H 2 , 600 sccm of Ar and 150 sccm of N 2 , followed by a 20 min graphene growth at 970 ◦ C using methane as carbon precursor ( 10 / 100 sccm CH 4 / H 2 ratio ) . A 700 nm thick sacriﬁcial layer of polymethyl methacrylate ( PMMA ) was spin - coated above the graphene ( 7 % 950k MW dissolved in anisole , Micro Resist Technology GmbH , DE ) . After a soft backing , specimens of about 10 mm 2 × 10 mm 2 in edge size were cut out . The graphene layer was separated from copper using an electrochemical delamination process ( De La Rosa et al . , 2013 ) and , after washing in deionized water , transferred onto supporting glass coverslips ( 12 mm 2 × 24 mm 2 , No . 1 , 0 . 13 – 0 . 16 mm in thickness , ORSAtec GmbH , DE ) . Before the transfer procedure , supporting substrates were ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropanol ( IPA ) to assure the required cleanness and activated with a UV - ozone treatment ( UVO , 5 min ) . After transfer , samples were let to dry and baked at 180 ◦ C for 2 min . The PMMA sacriﬁcial layer was removed by immersing samples in acetone and then in IPA , 30 min in each solvent . pSLG substrates were used as transferred while , in fSLG , phenyl acetic acid moieties were immobilized on the surface . The functionalization was accomplished by placing some of the pSLG substrates in a glass beaker with distilled water ( 10 mL ) . Then , a distilled water solution of 4 - ( carboxymethyl ) phenyl diazonium tetraﬂuoroborate ( 10 mg , 20 mM ﬁnal concentration , synthesized following a published diazotization procedure ( Franco et al . , 2020 ) was slowly added with a syringe pump ( 2 . 5 mL / h ) for 1 h at room temperature ( RT ) . Substrates were subsequently removed from the solution and cleaned by immersion ( 3 times ) in distilled water and dried over a stream of N 2 . The graphene materials were characterized by Raman spectroscopy and AFM . To evaluate the quality of graphene obtained and to quantify the functionalization degree , the ratio between the D ( ∼ 1 , 345 cm − 1 ) and G ( ∼ 1 , 589 cm − 1 ) Raman band intensities of graphene ( I D / I G ) were employed Frontiers in Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 2 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 811348 fnins - 15 - 811348 January 11 , 2022 Time : 10 : 24 # 3 Zummo et al . Graphene - Based Neuromodulation ( Bottari et al . , 2017 ) . Raman spectra were recorded with a Renishaw inVia TM Raman spectrometer equipped with a green laser ( λ = 532 nm ) and plotted after baseline correction using the Wire 4 . 4 software . An average defect density ( nD ) of 4 . 38 · 10 − 4 nm − 2 was obtained for fSLG samples . Defects were interpreted as changes in the graphene lattice C hybridization from sp 2 to sp 3 induced by the covalent modiﬁcation ( Cançado et al . , 2011 ) . Topographical changes of the surface of graphene were evaluated by performing AFM analysis ( see Atomic Force Microscopy section ) . Cell Cultures Preparation Dissociated hippocampal cells were derived from P0 – P3 old rats as described in the literature ( Lovat et al . , 2005 ; Cellot et al . , 2011 ; Pampaloni et al . , 2018b ; Rago et al . , 2019 ) . Brieﬂy , rat hippocampi were isolated and digested in trypsin and deoxyribonuclease ( 6 , 000 and 1 , 560 U / mL , respectively , both from Sigma Aldrich ) . After digestion , the cell suspension was centrifuged ( 800 rpm for 5 min ) , and the pellet was collected and resuspended in a fresh culture medium composed of Neurobasal - A medium ( Thermo - Fischer ) supplemented by B27 ( 2 % , Gibco ) and Glutamax R (cid:13) ( 10 mM , Gibco ) . Cells were plated on polyornithine - coated glass coverslips controls and on uncoated pSLG and fSLG substrates at a nominal concentration of 10 6 cells / mL ( 300 µ L for 45 min ) . Before cell plating , all substrates were sterilized for 30 min under UV light . Cultures were maintained in incubation conditions ( 37 ◦ C , 5 % CO 2 , 95 % RU ) in 35 mm petri dishes containing about 2 mL of culture medium . All the experiments were performed after 8 – 10 days in vitro ( DIV ) . All animal procedures were conducted following the indications of the National Institutes of Health and international and institutional standards for the care and use of animals in research . All experiments were performed in agreement with the Italian law ( decree 26 / 14 ) and the European Union ( EU ) guidelines ( 2007 / 526 / CE and 2010 / 63 / UE ) and were approved by the local authority veterinary service and by our institutional ( SISSA - ISAS ) ethical committee . All eﬀorts were made to minimize animal suﬀering and reduce the number of animals necessary to accomplish our studies . Immunoﬂuorescence Cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in phosphate buﬀered saline ( PBS ) for 20 min . Subsequently , samples were incubated for 1 h at RT in a PBS blocking solution containing 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 0 . 03 % Triton X - 100 to permeabilize cell membranes . After rinsing in PBS , primary antibodies were added for 1 h at RT and , after a PBS washing , secondary antibodies were added for 45 min in dark conditions ( Cellot et al . , 2016 ; Rago et al . , 2019 ) . As primary antibodies were used : mouse monoclonal anti - NeuN ( MAB377 , Sigma - Aldrich , 1 : 500 dilution ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - GFAP ( HPA056030 , Sigma - Aldrich , 1 : 500 dilution ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - β - tubulin III ( T2200 , Sigma - Aldrich , 1 : 250 dilution ) , and mouse monoclonal anti - GFAP ( G3893 , Sigma - Aldrich , 1 : 250 dilution ) . As secondary antibodies were instead used : AlexaFluor R (cid:13) 594 goat anti - mouse ( A11032 , Sigma - Aldrich , dilution 1 : 500 ) and anti - rabbit ( A11037 , Life Technologies , dilution 1 : 500 ) , and AlexaFluor R (cid:13) 488 goat anti - mouse ( A11029 , Life Technologies , dilution 1 : 500 ) and anti - rabbit ( A11034 , Sigma - Aldrich , dilution 1 : 500 ) . Unspeciﬁc cell - nuclei staining was performed using 4 (cid:48) , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI , D1306 , Thermo Fisher , dilution 1 : 200 ) . Samples were mounted on standard microscope glass slides ( Fisher Scientiﬁc ) using Fluoromount - G TM Mounting Medium ( Thermoﬁsher ) . NeuN and DAPI stainings were used to compute neuronal vs non - neuronal cell densities . Speciﬁcally , images 636 µ m × 636 µ m ( 1024 pixels × 1024 pixels ) were acquired with an epiﬂuorescence microscope ( DM6000 , Leica Microsystems ) using 20 × objective ( 0 . 5 N . A ) . Three visual ﬁelds per condition were randomly collected ( 2 samples per condition per session from three independent cell - culture series ) . The oﬄine analysis was conducted semi - automatically in Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) , using the cell - count plugin developed by Grishagin ( 2015 ) . Cell shape and network morphology were instead highlighted by immunolabeling neurons against β - tubulin III , and astrocytes against the glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) . Images were acquired using a confocal microscope ( Nikon eclipse C1 equipped with Ar / Kr and He / Ne lasers ) using a 60 × oil - immersion objective ( Plan Apo , 1 . 40 NA , Nikon Corporation ) . Images were recorded at 212 µ m × 212 µ m ( 1024 pixels × 1024 pixels ) collecting about 14 focal planes per ﬁeld ( 600 nm Z - stacks step - length ) . Electrophysiology All patch - clamp recordings were performed in voltage clamp mode in whole - cell conﬁguration at RT . The glass pipettes , thermally pulled to achieve a ﬁnal resistance of 4 – 8 M (cid:127) , were ﬁlled with an intracellular solution composed of 120 mM K - gluconate , 20 mM KCl , 10 mM HEPES , 10 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM Na 2 ATP ( pH 7 . 3 ; 300 mOsm in osmolarity , all compounds from Sigma Aldrich ) and immersed in an extracellular recording solution composed by 150 mM NaCl , 4 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES and 10 mM glucose ( pH 7 . 4 ; about 320 mOsm in osmolarity , all compounds from Sigma Aldrich ) . Data were collected using a Patch Clamp EPC 7 patch ampliﬁer ( HEKA Electronic , United States ) and digitized using a Digidata 1322A ( Molecular Devices LLC , United States ) at 10 kHz sampling frequency using the pClamp 8 . 2 acquisition software ( Molecular Devices LLC , United States ) . Cell membrane passive properties ( input resistance R m , and membrane capacitance C m ) , were measured by averaging the cell response to 80 voltage steps ( - 5 mV , 10 ms in duration ) in terms of currents through the Clampﬁt software ( pClamp 10 . 3 , Molecular Devices LLC , United States ) . Uncompensated series resistance was less than 11 M (cid:127) . Spontaneous post - synaptic currents ( PSCs ) were recorded by clamping the membrane voltage at - 56 mV holding potential ( value not corrected for the liquid junction potential , calculated to be equal to - 14 mV ) . Miniature post - synaptic currents ( mPSCs ) were instead recorded in the presence of 1 µ M Tetrodotoxin ( TTX , Latoxan ) , a speciﬁc blocker of fast - activating voltage - gated Na + channels . The analysis of synaptic events was performed oﬄine using the AxoGraph neuronal event detection software ( version 1 . 7 . 0 , Axon Scientiﬁc , United States ) . Speciﬁcally , for each recording all events detected were averaged Frontiers in Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 3 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 811348 fnins - 15 - 811348 January 11 , 2022 Time : 10 : 24 # 4 Zummo et al . Graphene - Based Neuromodulation and the peak amplitude and kinetic properties of the resulting mean current were measured . Atomic Force Microscopy Glass control , pSLG and fSLG substrate surfaces were characterized by AFM . A commercial Solver PRO AFM instrument ( NT - MDT Co . , RU ) was used in no - contact mode in air ( normal pressure and RT ) . Both topographic and phase signal images were acquired using silicon AFM tips ( Etalon R (cid:13) HA - NC rectangular cantilevers , spring constant 12 nN / nm , resonant frequency 235 kHz , probe tip radius 10 nm , NT - MDT Co . , RU ) . Images of 2 . 5 × 2 . 5 µ m 2 ( 512 × 512 pixels 2 ) were acquired at 1 lines / second scan speed . The open - source SPM analysis software Gwyddion ( Neˇcas and Klapetek , 2012 ) was used to process and analyze all AFM images . Root mean square line - roughness ( R RMS ) was deﬁned internally to the software and corresponds to the average of the height deviations from the mean line of the selected proﬁle . The stiﬀness of neuronal cells interfaced to glass , pSLG and fSLG substrates was evaluated through AFM force - indentation experiments . Measurements were carried out at RT in liquid environment ( PBS ) . Stiﬀness assessment was conducted taking advantage of the cell - mechanics analysis capability integrated into the AFM tool ( JPK NanoWizard R (cid:13) 3 , Bruker Nano Surfaces , United States ) . Experiments were performed using tip - less cantilevers with a nominal elastic constant of 0 . 03 nN / nm and a resonance frequency of 10 kHz ( CSG11 - B / tipless , NT - MDT Co . , Russia ) on which apex a glass bead ( 8 . 0 ± 0 . 4 µ m in diameter , No . 9008 , Duke Standards TM , Fremont , CA , United States ) was glued using a UV - curable glue ( Norland Optical Adhesive 61 , Norland Products , Inc . , United States ) . Cantilevers’ eﬀective elastic constants were determined by the software - integrated thermal method ( Lévy and Maaloum , 2002 ) . Neuronal cell stiﬀness has been evaluated after having ﬁxed cells in 4 % PFA in PBS and made them visible by NeuN staining . Although cell ﬁxation is known to increase cell stiﬀness , it has been shown that it is possible to use these values to perform a relative comparison of cell mechanical adaptation on the three diﬀerent substrates ( Jiang et al . , 2011 ; Grimm et al . , 2014 ; Ulloa et al . , 2021 ) . Indentation was conducted by manually placing the cantilever tip above the NeuN - stained cell soma . This strategy ensures high measurement reproducibility . Measurements were performed at a constant speed of 2 . 5 µ m / s and triggered to a maximum applied force of 5 nN and never exceeded an indentation depth of 250 nm , representing 5 % of the average measured cell height ( data not shown ) . Such maximum indentation avoided any contribution from the underneath substrate to the measured cell stiﬀness minimizing , at the same time , its susceptibility to cell nucleus stiﬀness . Cell stiﬀnesses were determined using the JPKSPM Data Processing R (cid:13) software by ﬁtting the obtained force - indentation curves with the integrated Hertzian model for a spherical indenter ( Sneddon , 1965 ) . Averaging values were computed from measurements performed on about 200 cells per condition from 3 independent experiments . Neuronal stiﬀness was reported in terms of Young’s Modulus ( E ) and expressed in kPa . Total Internal Reﬂection Fluorescence Total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) experiments were performed to evaluate the number and distribution of focal adhesions ( FAs ) in hippocampal cultures grown above glass , pSLG and fSLG substrates . Cellular samples were ﬁxed with 4 % PFA for 30 min at RT . After ﬁxation , samples were incubated for 1 h in a PBS blocking solution containing 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 0 . 03 % Triton X - 100 to block non - speciﬁc sites and permeabilized cells . Subsequently , they were incubated for 1 . 5 h at RT with a monoclonal mouse anti - vinculin antibody ( V9131 , Sigma - Aldrich , 1 : 400 dilution in blocking solution without Triton ) and a rabbit polyclonal anti - β - tubulin III ( T2200 , Sigma - Aldrich , 1 : 250 dilution in blocking solution without Triton ) . Then , samples , washed with PBS , were incubated for 1 h with a goat anti - mouse secondary antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor R (cid:13) 488 ( A11029 , Life Technologies , 1 : 500 dilution ) and Alexa Fluor R (cid:13) 594 goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( A11037 , Life Technologies , 1 : 500 dilution ) , diluted in blocking solution without Triton . Samples were mounted on standard microscope glass slides ( 7525M , J . Melvin Freed , United States ) using a liquid mounting medium ( Fluoromont - G TM , ThermoFisher ) , and then visualized using an inverted epi - ﬂuorescence microscope equipped with a TIRF module ( Nikon Eclipse - TiU , Nikon Corporation ) . Images were acquired in total reﬂection condition using a high aperture oil - immersion objective ( CFI Apochromat TIRF 100 × C Oil 1 . 49 N . A . , Nikon Corporation ) and a 488 nm laser ( OBIS 488 LS ; Coherent , Inc . , Santa Clara , CA , United States ) at a power suﬃcient to avoiding photo - bleaching . In our conditions , the penetration depth of the evanescent wave was about 150 nm . Samples were visualized using a CCD camera ( DS - Qi1 , Nikon Corporation ) acquiring for every ﬁeld of view a TIRF image of the vinculin staining and a conventional ﬂuorescence image of β - tubulin III positive regions ( 426 µ m 2 × 340 µ m 2 , 1280 × 1024 pixels 2 ) . FAs were quantiﬁed as vinculin - positive puncta exploiting a procedure developed within the Wolfram Mathematica software suite ( version 12 . 3 . 0 , Wolfram Research , Inc . , United States ) . Brieﬂy , vinculin signal was analyzed exclusively in β - tubulin positive regions . After image binarization , puncta were highlighted using a morphological - matching procedure based on disks of increasing radius ( from 300 nm to 3 µ m ) and segmented . For every condition , the area of every detected punctum was computed and averaged . FAs density was evaluated as the ratio between the total number of puncta and the area of β - tubulin positive regions . Statistical Analysis All the described experiments were repeated at least three times using cell cultures from independent experimental sessions . All statistical analysis was performed using the Prism software ( version 6 . 0 , GraphPad ) . Data distribution was evaluated by the Shapiro Wilk test of normality and , based on the result , a bar chart showing mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) or a box plot representation was chosen to graphically represent data . Box plots are plotted as median with boxes spanning from the 25th ( 1st quartile , Q1 ) to the 75th ( 3rd quartile , Q3 ) percentiles , with Frontiers in Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 4 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 811348 fnins - 15 - 811348 January 11 , 2022 Time : 10 : 24 # 5 Zummo et al . Graphene - Based Neuromodulation whiskers representing the 5th and 95th percentiles . Statistics between two independent samples were performed with t - test when the distribution was normal . For parametric data Student’s t - test was used to compare two independent conditions , while comparisons between more than two conditions were performed performing a one - way ANOVA analysis followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison post - hoc test . For non - parametric data , Mann Whitney for two groups comparison test or Kruskal - Wallis followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test were used . For the sake of clarity , all the values reported in the main text are expressed as mean ± SD . Statistical signiﬁcance was determined at P < 0 . 05 , unless otherwise indicated . Signiﬁcance was graphically indicated as follows : ∗ P < 0 . 05 , ∗∗ P < 0 . 01 , ∗∗∗ P < 0 . 001 . RESULTS Materials Fabrication and Characterization Single - layer graphene was grown on ﬂat Cu foils , separated from copper using an electrochemical delamination process , and subsequently transferred onto supporting glass substrates ( Figure 1A ) . The quality of CVD - grown pSLG and the eﬀectiveness of chemical functionalization of fSLG were assessed by Raman spectroscopy analysis ( Figure 1B ) . Speciﬁcally , the distinctive graphene Raman spectrum is characterized by the signature bands so - called D , G and 2D ( Reina et al . , 2009 ; Dong et al . , 2011 ; Nguyen et al . , 2013 ) . The D peak , localizes at about 1 , 345 cm − 1 , is more prominent when chemical or structural non - idealities are present , such as impurities or defects , but it can also be correlated with covalent chemical functionalization ( Criado et al . , 2015 ) . The G peak , placed at about 1 , 589 cm − 1 , is characteristic of sp 2 hybridization showing the structural order and purity in all graphitic materials whereas , the 2D peak , sited at about 2 , 689 cm − 1 , is characteristic of the atomically - thick 2D nature of graphene ﬁlms . For instance , peaks’ characteristics analysis allows the discrimination between single - versus multi - layered graphene , as reported in the literature ( Ferrari et al . , 2006 ; Faugeras et al . , 2009 ; Malard et al . , 2009 ) . Precisely , it is well - known that the ratio of the intensity of the 2D and G bands ( I 2 D / I G ) is indicative of the number of graphene layers . A 2 < I 2 D / I G < 3 ratio is indicative of monolayer graphene , 1 < I 2 D / I G < 2 of bilayer graphene , while I 2 D / I G < 1 is associated with the multilayer one . In addition , the presence of single - layer graphene can also be evinced by analyzing the shape of the 2D peak , where a full width at half maximum ( FWHM 2 D ) value of about 38 cm − 1 is indicative of a single - layer material , even in the presence of I 2 D / I G value falling between 1 and 2 . Based on measured I 2 D / I G and FWMH 2 D values , we can state that the graphene ﬁlms grown on the Cu foil at 970 ◦ C were mainly a monolayer with a contingent distribution of double - layer nucleation sites . Pristine SLG was chemically modiﬁed through a radical reaction employing 4 - ( carboxymethyl ) phenyl diazonium tetraﬂuoroborate ( Figure 1C ) . The diazonium salt reacts with graphene through a single electron transfer ( SET ) mechanism , resulting in a change in the hybridization of carbon atoms within the graphene lattice from sp 2 to sp 3 ( Paulus et al . , 2013 ) . Chemically modiﬁed SLG samples were also characterized by Raman spectroscopy ( Figure 1B , red line ) and AFM ( Figure 1E ) to conﬁrm and evaluate the chemical modiﬁcation . Based on Raman scattering , the successful chemical modiﬁcation was conﬁrmed by a signiﬁcant increment in the I D / I G ratio ( Figure 1D ) . The increased intensity of the D peak evidenced the change in the hybridization of carbon atoms , as defects in the structure of graphene , which would be purely sp 2 ( Figure 1B ) . The quantiﬁcation of the degree of chemical functionalization was carried out by evaluating the defect density ( nD ) ( Cançado et al . , 2011 ) using the following relation : nD (cid:0) cm − 2 (cid:1) = ( 1 . 8 ± 0 . 5 ) × 10 22 λ 4 L · (cid:18) I D I G (cid:19) where λ L is the excitation wavelength . It is worth noting that this equation is valid for Raman data obtained from graphene samples with distances between defects ≥ 10 nm . Thus , the fSLG samples showed a moderate average nD = 4 . 38 · 10 − 4 nm − 2 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . The morphology of pristine and phenylacetic acid functionalized SLG ﬁlms were characterized by AFM and compared to bare glass coverslips control substrates ( Figure 1E ) . Line proﬁle analysis revealed an increase in surface roughness compared to glass ( Ctrl ) , for both pSLG and fSLG ( Figure 1E , bottom ; R RMS = 0 . 18 nm for Ctrl , R RMS = 0 . 61 nm for pSLG , and R RMS = 1 . 24 nm for fSLG ) , as apparent in the three topographical reconstructions . The qualitative change in SLG surface morphology after the chemical modiﬁcation , quantiﬁed in terms of an increased roughness , can be correlated to the well - known oligomers derived from the generated phenyl radicals ( Hossain et al . , 2010 ) . Graphene Substrates Support the Development of Hippocampal Neuronal Networks Even though several reports have already demonstrated the successful development of hippocampal cell cultures interfaced with graphene substrates ( Tang et al . , 2013 ; Fabbro et al . , 2016 ; Kitko et al . , 2018 ; Pampaloni et al . , 2018a ; Rauti et al . , 2020b ) , this aspect has not been evaluated on chemically functionalized graphene yet . To explore the potential eﬀects of graphene and its chemical functionalization on cell development and network composition , we cultured primary hippocampal neurons on both pSLG and fSLG supports . Neurons plated directly on glass coverslips were used as control cultures ( Lovat et al . , 2005 ; Cellot et al . , 2009 ; Pampaloni et al . , 2018b ; Rago et al . , 2019 ) . Both graphene substrates , pSLG and fSLG , were able to sustain a similar growth and development of hippocampal cells with respect to the glass control condition . We qualitatively investigated the network size and phenotypical composition evaluating the density of neuronal and non - neuronal cells . Speciﬁcally , we marked the nuclei of all the cells of our cultures using 4 (cid:48) , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) and speciﬁcally highlighted neurons by immunolabelling them Frontiers in Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 5 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 811348 fnins - 15 - 811348 January 11 , 2022 Time : 10 : 24 # 6 Zummo et al .

An automatic procedure was used to binarize images and classify cells as neuronal or non - neuronal ( Figure 2A , inlets ) . The non - neuronal constituent of primary hippocampal cultures is neuroglia ( Jäkel and Dimou , 2017 ) which , in our experimental conditions , is mainly composed by astrocytes ( Lovat et al . , 2005 ; Cellot et al . , 2016 ; Rauti et al . , 2020a ) . No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were detected across all three substrates in terms of neuronal density ( Figure 2B ) or neuroglia density ( Figure 2C ) .

( D ) Bars plot highlighting the consistency of the neuronal / glial cells density ratio across the three conditions ( p > 0 . 05 ) . neuronal and glial cells appeared to be similar across all three conditions ( Figure 2D ) . Graphene Substrates Alter Neuronal Electrical Activity To assess the impact of graphene substrates on the cellular morphology of the interfaced networks , we revealed by immunoﬂuorescence the shape of neurons and astrocytes . For that purpose , we marked the neuronal cytoskeletal components β - tubulin III and the glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) , while cells nuclei were stained using DAPI ( Figure 3A ) . Confocal micrographs show that cells adopt a healthy morphology without any apparent diﬀerence across the three conditions . We further extended our investigation by performing a functional analysis of the spontaneous synaptic activity characterizing our neuronal networks interfaced to graphene and glass for 8 – 10 DIV . Voltage - clamp electrophysiological experiments were conducted by patching neurons within the three conditions and recording network spontaneous post - synaptic currents . Heterogeneous PSCs were detected as inward currents of variable amplitudes ( Lovat et al . , 2005 ) in all conditions , as shown by the three representative traces in Figure 3B . Plasma membrane passive properties , measured for each patched neuron , provided further indications about cell viability and membrane integrity in cells developed above pSLG and fSLG substrates . We compared the results with glass controls and no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were identiﬁed in terms of input resistance and membrane capacitance over the three experimental groups ( Figure 3C ; 519 ± 208 M (cid:127) and 54 . 8 ± 8 . 5 pF for Ctrl , n = 23 cells ; 438 ± 134 M (cid:127) and 51 . 7 ± 9 . 6 pF for pSLG , n = 16 ; 493 ± 188 M (cid:127) and 47 . 2 ± 9 . 1 pF for fSLG , n = 16 ) . The appearance of spontaneous post - synaptic events in all of our traces was both evidence of functional synaptic formation and an index of network eﬃcacy ( Lovat et al . , 2005 ; Pampaloni et al . , 2018a ) . Interestingly , the quantiﬁcation of the amplitude and frequency of PSCs in pSLG and fSLG interfaced neurons revealed a diﬀerent functional adaptation of these networks when compared to glass . Speciﬁcally , our data highlighted that while PSCs amplitudes of networks developed above glass and pSLG were almost identical , pSLG interfaced neuronal networks showed a signiﬁcant enhancement in the frequency of synaptic currents with respect to controls ( Figure 3D , gray and blue boxes ; 32 . 62 ± 7 . 65 pA and 1 . 31 ± 0 . 56 Hz for glass controls , n = 23 cells ; Frontiers in Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 7 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 811348 fnins - 15 - 811348 January 11 , 2022 Time : 10 : 24 # 8 Zummo et al . Graphene - Based Neuromodulation FIGURE 3 | Graphene - based substrates modulate neuronal network activity . ( A ) Representative confocal micrographs of hippocampal cells grown on glass control , pSLG and fSLG . Neurons were labeled against β - tubulin III ( red ) , astrocytes against GFAP ( green ) and nuclei with DAPI ( blue ) . Scale bars : 40 µ m . ( B ) Representative voltage - clamp current traces for controls ( in black , on the left ) , pSLG ( in blue , on the middle ) and fSLG ( in red , on the right ) . ( C ) Box plot summarizing neuronal cell membrane resistances ( R m , plain boxes ) and capacitances ( R c , striped boxes ) across the three supporting substrates . ( D ) Boxplot of PSCs amplitudes ( left ) and frequencies ( right ) . A signiﬁcant difference was detected only in fSLG PSCs amplitudes , while pSLG and fSLG oppositely modulated neuronal PSCs frequencies ( up - regulating and down - regulating , respectively ) . Signiﬁcance : * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 . 33 . 76 ± 5 . 11 pA and 2 . 33 ± 1 . 24 Hz for pSLG , n = 16 ) . In contrast , fSLG induced a signiﬁcant reduction in both PSCs amplitude and frequency in interfaced networks compared with pSLG and glass ( Figure 3D , red boxes ; 21 . 74 ± 8 . 4 pA and 0 . 48 ± 0 . 40 Hz for fSLG , n = 16 cells ) . To move through this phenomenon , we tested if the changes in synaptic activity detected in our experiments could result from a structural reassembling at the synaptic level . We measured miniature postsynaptic currents ( mPSCs ) by application of TTX ( Figure 4A ) . For each condition we evaluated the amplitude and frequency of mPSCs . The former gives an indication about the number of neurotransmitter receptors localized at the post - synaptic terminal , whereas the latter is mainly inﬂuenced by the pre - synaptic release probability and by the number of synaptic contacts ( Raastad et al . , 1992 ; Pampaloni et al . , 2018a ) . Interestingly , no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in amplitudes nor frequencies were detected across the three conditions ( Figure 4B ; 13 . 2 ± 6 . 2 pA and 1 . 1 ± 0 . 85 Hz for glass , n = 10 cells analyzed ; 13 . 9 ± 7 . 2 pA and 1 ± 0 . 5 Hz for pSLG , n = 10 ; 15 . 2 ± 6 . 8 pA and 0 . 8 ± 0 . 7 Hz for fSLG , n = 10 ) . Consequently , we can rule out that pristine or phenylacetic acid modiﬁed graphene substrates alter the structural functionality of synapses at pre - and post - synaptic level , excluding that such phenomenon stays behind the observed changes in network activity . Focal Adhesion Organization and Cell Stiffness To point out if the two graphene substrates may have had an impact on focal adhesions ( FAs ) , we attempted an evaluation of their distribution and size using total internal ﬂuorescence microscopy ( TIRF ) . For this purpose , we performed an immunostaining assay ﬂuorescently labeling vinculin , a cytoskeletal protein associated with the cytosolic protein complex of FAs , together with β - tubulin III ( highlighting neuronal cytoskeleton ) , after 8 – 9 DIV ( Figure 5A ; top and bottom rows , respectively ) . FAs analysis was conducted visualizing vinculin - positive regions by TIRF , conﬁning in this way the analysis to a volume extending just about a hundred of nanometers from the graphene surface ( see section “Materials and Methods” ) .

Graphene - Based Neuromodulation FIGURE 4 | Graphene - based substrates do not alter the structural functionality of synapses at pre - and post - synaptic levels . ( A ) Representative traces of mPSCs for the three conditions under investigation . ( B ) Box plots of mPSCs amplitudes ( left ) and frequencies ( right ) measured from neuronal networks developed above glass , pSLG and fSLG substrates . No signiﬁcant differences were detected across the three experimental groups regarding both mPSCs amplitudes nor frequencies ( p > 0 . 05 ) . This approach made it possible to exclude from the analysis the majority of the signal coming from cytosolic vinculin not associated with FAs . β - tubulin III signal was instead acquired as a normal epi - ﬂuorescence signal . We evaluated vinculin puncta density across the three kinds of substrates highlighting a signiﬁcant reduction in puncta densities in graphene substrates ( Figure 5B ; 0 . 49 ± 0 . 12 puncta / µ m 2 for glass controls , n = 12 ﬁelds analyzed ; 0 . 37 ± 0 . 05 puncta / µ m 2 for pSLG , n = 12 ; 0 . 31 ± 0 . 11 puncta / µ m 2 for fSLG , n = 12 ) . Interestingly , when we estimated the average size of vinculin puncta detected across the three conditions , we observed that pSLG and fSLG induced an opposite eﬀect when compared with glass controls . Neuronal cells interfaced with pSLG were characterized by larger puncta , while cells interfaced with fSLG presented signiﬁcantly smaller ones than controls ( Figure 5C ; 0 . 157 ± 0 . 015 µ m 2 for glass controls , n = 12 ﬁelds analyzed ; 0 . 173 ± 0 . 010 µ m 2 for pSLG , n = 12 ; 0 . 125 ± 0 . 011 µ m 2 for fSLG , n = 12 ) . These values allow us to assume that diﬀerent mechanisms were involved in FAs modulation by pSLG and fSLG . In order to evaluate if pSLG and fSLG substrates impacted the cellular mechanoadaptation of interfaced hippocampal neurons , we have evaluated cell stiﬀness across the three experimental conditions . The rigidity of a cell is determined by a complex tensional equilibrium established within the cell as an adaptation to the mechanical and chemical cues provided by the extracellular environment ( Azadi et al . , 2019 ) . In in vitro systems , this condition includes the compliance of the culturing substrate ( Byﬁeld et al . , 2009 ; Tee et al . , 2011 ) , its chemical functionalization ( Peyton et al . , 2006 ) , or micro and nano morphology ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) . All these factors could induce cell stiﬀening or softening through an alteration in cytoskeletal structure / organization eventually mediated by a reshaping of FAs number and dimensions too ( Saphirstein et al . , 2013 ; Gupta et al . , 2016 ) . In our study , we have probed cell stiﬀness values of cells interfaced with pSLG , fSLG and glass control by means of AFM force - indentation experiments ( Luo et al . , 2016 ) . We have described cell stiﬀness in terms of Young’s elastic modulus ( E ) , a parameter commonly accepted to qualitatively quantify the rigidity of a cell ( Ding et al . , 2017 ) . We discovered that pSLG did not aﬀect neuronal cell stiﬀness but , conversely , fSLG interfaced cells appeared signiﬁcantly softer than glass controls ( Figure 5A ; 6 . 2 ± 2 . 6 kPa for glass controls , n = 168 cells analyzed ; 6 . 2 ± 2 . 8 for pSLG , n = 203 ; 4 . 0 ± 4 . 0 kPa for fSLG , n = 140 ) . DISCUSSION Herein , we fabricated high - quality single - layer graphene ﬁlms by CVD on ﬂat Cu foils and subsequently transferred them on supporting glass coverslips . We chemically functionalized graphene substrates with carboxyl groups by surface insertion of phenylacetic acid moieties . Both pristine graphene ﬁlms ( pSLG ) and functionalized ones ( fSLG ) were characterized by high chemical and structural quality , and demonstrated to be nanometrically ﬂat on a length scale comparable with neuronal cells processes ( about 1 – 5 µ m ) . Indeed , from a surface morphology point of view , the two graphene substrates were perceived by the cells to be comparatively as even as control glass substrates ( Figure 1 ; Rajnicek et al . , 1997 ; Fan et al . , 2002 ; Baranes et al . , 2012 ) . The ability of graphene substrates to sustain proper cell adhesion and development was evaluated by interfacing them with primary cultures of rat hippocampus . We assessed the content of neuronal and glial cells above pristine and carboxyl - functionalized graphene substrates in comparison to glass controls and no signiﬁcative diﬀerences emerged between the cellular networks developed above the three substrates ( Figure 2 ) . This result conﬁrmed once again the extremely good cyto - compatibility of graphene - based materials ( Lee et al . , 2011 ; Li et al . , 2011 ; Pampaloni et al . , 2018a ) and , for the ﬁrst time , allowed us to state that a similar behavior is also found in the case of a covalent insertion of phenylacetic acid moieties on it . Subsequently , we moved to a multi - technique approach , combining immunoﬂuorescence , patch - clamping electrophysiology and scanning probe microscopy to evaluate the morphological and functional adaptation of the neuronal networks interfaced to graphene substrates for 8 – 9 DIV . Overall , our results demonstrate that the morphology of hippocampal cell networks developed above pSLG and fSLG substrates are almost identical to that of glass controls . Electrophysiology showed that also neuronal passive properties ( R m and C m ) were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent , an indication of similar plasma membrane condition and cellular dimensions ( Cellot et al . , 2011 ) .

Statistically signiﬁcant differences emerged between the three experimental groups . ( D ) Box plot depicting cell stiffnesses measured on neurons grown above the three examined substrates . A signiﬁcant reduction in cell stiffness was found in the case of fSLG - interfaced cells . Signiﬁcance : * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 . Interestingly , network spontaneous activity was signiﬁcantly higher in terms of frequency on pSLG - interfaced networks , but lower in fSLG - interfaced ones ( Figure 3 ) . This result highlighted an opposite modulation of neuronal cells electrical activity by the two graphene substrates , presumably indicating that two diﬀerent adaptation mechanisms are involved . In the attempt to shed some light on this aspect , we extended our investigation to the synaptic adaptation of the network by measuring the miniature PSCs of TTX - silenced networks across the three conditions . This study allowed to decouple within the network activity the contribution of dynamical components from structural components . We discovered that both graphene substrates have no eﬀect on both the amplitude and frequency of miniature events compared to controls ( Figure 4 ) . This result suggests that the alterations in the spontaneous postsynaptic activity described earlier in graphene - interfaced neurons do not involve any structural changes in the presynaptic release probability or the number of synaptic contacts , as well as on postsynaptic receptor sensitivity ( Raastad et al . , 1992 ) . To evaluate the possibility that graphene substrates alter the network electrical activity as a side eﬀect of a more complex , surface - mediated , tensional adaptation of the cell , we evaluated two cellular aspects connected to surface properties and mechanoadaptation : the focal adhesions organization and Frontiers in Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 10 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 811348 fnins - 15 - 811348 January 11 , 2022 Time : 10 : 24 # 11 Zummo et al . Graphene - Based Neuromodulation the cellular stiﬀness . In the ﬁrst case , compared to controls , we highlighted a reduction in FAs densities across graphene substrates , which are particularly signiﬁcative in fSLG - interfaced cells . Interestingly , FAs size was oppositely regulated by the two substrates : pSLG cells presented larger FAs while fSLG FAs were signiﬁcantly smaller . This result apparently underlines for cells on pSLG an adaptive mechanism where fewer FAs are compensated by their larger size . Conversely , in fSLG - interfaced cells , this compensation is not activated and both the number and the size of FAs were reduced . Because FAs represent the fundamental cellular structure responsible for cytoskeleton - mediated cellular mechanoadaptation , we evaluated through AFM force - indentations the stiﬀness of neuronal cells developed above graphene substrates . We pointed out that , while the stiﬀness of pSLG - interfaced neurons did not change compared to control cells , fSLG cells resulted signiﬁcantly softer than controls ( Figure 5 ) . Cell softening may be the eventual result of an impaired ability of the cell to adjust its internal tension through actomyosin - mediated cytoskeletal reorganization ( Lessey et al . , 2012 ) mainly due to the low density and size of the FAs that mechanically link the cell and the extracellular environment . Indeed , despite the fact further studies will be necessary to elucidate the electrophysiological impact of fSLG on neuronal ﬁring and excitability , we have demonstrated how the physicochemical properties of a carboxyl - functionalized graphene substrate could impact not only the electrical activity of interfaced cells , but also their mechanoadaptation . CONCLUSION This study compared the ( morpho ) mechanical and functional adaptation of rat primary hippocampal neurons when interfaced with surfaces covered with pristine single - layer graphene and functionalized graphene endowed with carboxylic functional groups . Our results conﬁrmed the intrinsic ability of single - layer graphene layered on glass to boost spontaneous neuronal activity highlighting , on the other hand , the reduction in the electrical activity inducible by the - COOH functionalization . On these substrates , neurons showed a signiﬁcant decrease in the frequency of spontaneous postsynaptic currents , coupled to a reduced average cell stiﬀness and altered focal adhesion organization in respect to controls . The reduced electrical activity observed in fSLG - interfaced neurons may be an indirect consequence of the altered mechanical properties of the cells or , instead , the result of an independent functional adaptation mechanism taking place in neurons . Further studies will be necessary to address this open question about neuronal mechanoadaptation as well as the speciﬁc role played by diﬀerent surface chemistries ( e . g . , amine and methyl functional groups ) . Overall , we have here demonstrated that two graphene substrates , pristine and carboxylic - functionalized , could be alternatively used to intrinsically promote or depress neuronal activity in primary hippocampal cultures . We believe that neuronal implants endowed with pSLG and fSLG may be applied in future as passive neuromodulation devices potentially able to treat CNS diseases associated with a local dysregulation in neuronal activity ( Edwards et al . , 2012 ; Sullivan et al . , 2021 ) .
