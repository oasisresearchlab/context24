This method is inappropriate and largely impacted by the pre - test variability as opposed to the variability in the intervention itself . Furthermore , the percentage change is often analyzed , but this is highly impacted by the baseline values and can be potentially misleading . Thus , the objective of this study was to illustrate the common misuse of the effect size and percent change measures . Design : Here we provide a realistic sample data set comparing two resistance training groups with the same pre - test to post - test change . Methods : Statistical tests that are commonly performed within the literature were computed . Results : Analyzing the within group effect size favors the control group , while the percent change favors the experimental group . The most appropriate way to present the data would be to plot the individual responses or , for larger samples , provide the mean change and 95 % confidence intervals of the mean change . This details the magnitude and variability within the response to the intervention itself in units that are easily interpretable . Conclusions : This manuscript demonstrates the common misuse of the effect size and details the importance for investigators to always report raw values , even when alternative statistics are performed . Keywords : Cohen’s d , muscle hypertrophy , muscle size , percentage change , statistics 3 Introduction The use of the effect size has been recommended as it expands upon significance testing by providing the magnitude of change 1 . A number of different methods can be used to calculate effect sizes including eta squared , omega squared and Cohen’s d . The eta and omega squared calculations are used to report the variance explained by an intervention when the data are analyzed via analysis of variance and are not commonly used within the exercise science literature . These studies commonly calculate the within subject Cohen’s d with the equation [ ( post - test score – pre - test score ) / pre - test standard deviation ] or [ ( post - test score – pre - test score ) / pooled pre - test and post - test standard deviation ) ] , with the majority of studies presumably using the [ ( post - test – pre - test ) / pre - test standard deviation ] calculation as they are simply calculating the effect of the intervention from pre - testing to post - testing within the same group . While Cohen’s d was originally proposed as an effect size for social and behavioral sciences , this calculation is often used within the exercise science literature . For example , the magnitude inference has been adjusted for the use within the resistance training literature 2 and is commonly used to assess changes in muscle size , strength , endurance and power 3 – 29 . This is important as the commonly adopted Cohen’s d benchmarks were developed for comparisons between unrestricted populations and using these benchmarks for repeated measures is not consistent with the considerations in which these thresholds were based . Application of such benchmarks , however , may serve some utility in novel studies where comparisons to other studies are not possible . Similar to Cohen’s d , the magnitude of an effect can also be expressed as a percentage change using the equation [ ( post - pre / pre ) * 100 ] 7 , 10 , 11 , 14 , 16 , 22 . The percentage change is similar to the within subject Cohen’s d effect size calculation except the pre - test to post - test change is divided by the pre - test value as opposed to the standard deviation . The use of effect size and percentage change are provided to illustrate the magnitude of an effect as opposed to just reporting the p - value , and may be useful for comparing results across studies using different measurement techniques ( e . g . ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging for muscle size ) and is therefore commonly used in meta - analyses 30 – 34 . 4 Importantly , although exercise science studies often compare results between groups ( e . g . experimental and control ) , these studies commonly perform within group effect sizes 3 – 27 and then compare these individual effect sizes amongst one another , which may not be appropriate 35 . While rarely performed appropriately 28 , using the between group Cohen’s d effect size with the equation [ ( mean change group 1 – mean change group 2 ) / pooled standard deviation of the change score ] appropriately illustrates the results in a manner capable of comparing groups . Even so , the effect size calculation should be a supplementary statistic and should only be reported in addition to the raw values as it may be difficult to interpret given it is expressed in arbitrary units . Therefore , the purpose of this current opinion to point out the incorrect use of the effect size and to also encourage authors to report raw data when choosing to use effect sizes and percentage change within original research , particularly in certain situations where measurement reliability and non - normality is a concern . For example , even when the between group effect size is appropriately used , an unreliable measure will likely render a greater standard deviation , which in turn will influence the effect size estimate . Below we will discuss how a change in the standard deviation can influence an effect size estimate , but bear in mind that the normality of the outcome variable across the groups can also drastically influence effect size estimation . For example , two groups with a normal distribution and a mean unit difference of “2” can have an effect size estimate of “1” , and similarly , two other groups that are not normally distributed can render an effect size estimate of “1” when their mean unit difference is much larger ( e . g . “5” ) . Effect Size The measure of a within group Cohen’s d effect size is expressed as a number detailing the magnitude of change relative to the standard deviation such that an effect size of 1 . 0 demonstrates the change in a variable to be equal to the standard deviation . The standard deviation of a sample illustrates the variability from the group mean . Similar to that of percentage change , multiplying the effect size by 100 illustrates the magnitude of change as a percentage . While expressed as a ratio , a within group effect size of 0 . 25 , 0 . 50 5 and 0 . 75 would represent changes of 25 , 50 and 75 % of the standard deviation . Thus a larger effect size can occur in one or two ways : ( 1 ) a larger magnitude of change and / or ( 2 ) a reduction in the standard deviation ( Table 1 ) . The within group Cohen’s d effect size calculation commonly used in the exercise science literature can be performed using the pre - test standard deviation or the pooled pre - test and post - test standard deviation . Either method will be highly reliant on the variability before the intervention ( pre - test standard deviation ) given that the pre - test standard deviation will not differ too much from the post - test standard deviation if all individuals respond to the intervention in a somewhat similar fashion . Using the pre - test standard deviation or pooled pre - test and post - test standard deviation for a specific variable does not explain the variability of the training effect , but rather the variability of the study population . Thus , even a wide array of training responses to a given stimulus can actually reduce the pooled standard deviation provided it brings most individuals toward the group mean . Therefore , assessing the variability in the change from baseline would likely be more advantageous as this shows whether the intervention produced similar results across individuals ( Figure 1 ) . This is feasible given that the majority of the studies interpreting effect sizes for variables in the exercise science field include < 15 individuals per group 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 9 – 12 , 14 , 16 , 17 , 20 – 27 . While the within group effect sizes are commonly used when assessing multiple groups 3 – 27 , the between group Cohen’s d calculation would be more appropriate and can be performed using the equation [ ( group 1 mean change – group 2 mean change ) / pooled standard deviation of change scores ] . Importantly , the between group effect size uses the standard deviation of the change score as opposed to the pre - test standard deviation , rendering this much more appropriate when comparing multiple groups ( e . g . experimental vs . control ) . Nonetheless , the majority of exercise science studies often employ within group effect sizes and then compare these effect sizes amongst one another . This technique of taking the difference between two separate within group effect sizes yields different results in comparison to calculating the between groups effect size . Specifically , this is detailed Table 2 where common practice within the exercise science 6 literature would suggest a 0 . 78 greater effect size ( 1 . 53 - . 75 ) in the control group when the appropriate between group effect size is actually 0 . 0 . Even so , this 0 . 0 effect size is expressed in arbitrary units subject to arbitrary cut points 2 and may be difficult to interpret as opposed to a 0 . 0 kg change in 1RM strength expressed in units that can be easily evaluated for scientific relevance while also taking into consideration measurement error . Additionally , and like other statistics , the effect size provides an inference on the average for the sample as a whole , and hence , provides no information at the individual - level . It is common in the exercise science literature to observe individual - level effects ( e . g . , responders vs . non - responders ) 36 , which underscores the importance of investigating data dynamics at the individual level , as opposed to merely computing summary statistics at the group - level . Percentage Change The percentage change calculation is often used to express the relative change for each individual . If the average of each individual’s percentage change is taken , the mean will be much higher if the individuals with lower baseline values respond to a greater extent than those with higher baseline values . For example , if two individuals each increase strength by 1 kg , this increase will be twice as large in an individual with a baseline of 10kg ( 10 % ) when compared to an individual with a baseline of 20kg ( 5 % ) . The wide range of trainability in response to resistance training 36 makes taking the percentage change an inappropriate way to analyze the data obtained within the same study in which all individuals undergo the same training protocol and testing procedures . Example of How Different Analyses May be Misleading To best detail how the use of the effect size and percentage change can be misinterpreted , we have created a sample data set to compare two groups performing elbow flexion exercise . We will assume we are comparing the effects of two different elbow flexion exercise protocols on 1RM strength . All of the raw values used for this hypothetical example can be viewed in Table 2 and the same data set was used for the calculation of the pre - test and post - test values , effect size and percentage change . The subheadings below 7 demonstrate the results of the statistical analysis and a brief conclusion that could be made based on the results . It must be noted that this example analyzes within group effect sizes because this is what is commonly done in the exercise science literature 3 – 27 . Since original studies do not provide all of the individual data as we have provided in this example ( Table 2 ) , there would be no way of running any additional analyses . We are in no way advocating that this is an appropriate way of illustrating the results , but are rather presenting the results in a manner that is commonly implemented within the exercise science literature . It should be noted that the between group effect size would not show any between group effect ( d = 0 . 0 ) given the same mean change between groups , but again this does not provide any information above what the raw values illustrate . Results Analyze the Raw Values A repeated measures ANOVA across time with a between subject factor of group was used to determine differences in elbow flexion strength ( using data in Table 2 ) . No differences were observed between the control [ pre : 8 . 8 ( 0 . 9 ) kg post : 10 . 3 ( 2 . 0 ) kg ] and experimental [ pre : 8 . 8 ( 2 . 0 ) kg post : 10 . 3 ( 1 . 4 ) ] groups ( p = 0 . 83 ) . When analyzing the variability in the responses to training , the control group increased 1 . 5 kg ( 95 % CI : 1 . 0 – 2 . 0 ) and the experimental group also increased 1 . 5 kg ( 95 % CI : 0 . 9 – 2 . 1 ) . Between group comparisons demonstrated that difference in change scores was 0 . 0 kg ( 95 % CI : - 0 . 9 – 0 . 8 ) . When collapsed across time both groups increased 1 . 5 kg ( 95 % CI : 1 . 1 - 1 . 9 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . The experimental protocol provided no greater effect above that of the control protocol . Analyze the Effect Size While the repeated measures ANOVA was not statistically significant ( p > 0 . 05 ) , Cohen’s d was used to calculate the effect size to detail the magnitude of change ( using data in Table 2 ) . According to the scale 8 proposed by Rhea 2 , individuals in the control group had an effect size of 1 . 53 illustrating a large effect , whereas the experimental group had an effect size of 0 . 75 demonstrating a moderate effect . While not statistically significant , the differences in effect size illustrate the magnitude of change was likely greater in the control group . Analyze the Relative Percentage Change While the repeated measures ANOVA was not statistically significant ( p > 0 . 05 ) , the experimental group ( 21 % ) appeared to increase to a greater extent than that of the control group ( 15 % ) ( using data in Table 2 ) . These results illustrate that the experimental protocol had a greater effect on muscle strength when compared to the control group itself . This data set demonstrates the potential issues with using percentage change and effect size to detail differences in original research . While the raw values demonstrate the exact pre - test to post - test change between groups with no statistical differences , the percentage change demonstrates a greater strength increase in the experimental group , while the effect size results favor the control group . As presented in the example , it is common for the effect size estimate to be emphasized despite a lack of statistical significance . When this approach is used , albeit rarely appropriate in the exercise science literature , the 95 % confidence intervals of the effect size should always be reported to illustrate the variability in the training response . Conclusion If effect sizes and percentage changes are calculated , they should simply be used as supplementary statistics accompanying raw values when calculated within original research studies examining resistance training interventions . Additionally , calculating and comparing multiple within group effect sizes should be avoided , and the more appropriate between group Cohnen’s d effect size should be used . Even so , studies within the exercise science field should primarily analyze the results by interpreting the raw values . Either the individual responses 37 or the 95 % CI of the change score 38 should be reported to look at patterns and 9 the variability of the intervention . This allows the author and the reader to make their own inference on the magnitude of change within the context of the measurement used , while also detailing the variability in response to the intervention . After all , it is much easier to make an assumption on the effectiveness of a squat protocol producing a 25 kg increase in squat strength as opposed to attempting to infer the effectiveness of an effect size of 0 . 6 , for example . Practical implications  Effect sizes and percentage change should be used as supplementary statistics as opposed to the primary method of reporting data  Making conclusions based solely on the effect size or percentage change can produce misleading results  When multiple groups are being compared between group ( as opposed to within group ) effect sizes should be used Funding source : none Conflicts of interest : none Acknowledgements : None 10 REFERENCES 1 Sullivan GM , Feinn R .

Examples of different effect size calculations Example 1 : When the standard deviations are held constant the effect size provides no added information Pre Post Change Effect Size Magnitude 20 ( 5 ) 22 . 5 ( 5 ) 2 . 5 0 . 50 Small 20 ( 5 ) 25 ( 5 ) 5 1 . 00 Moderate 20 ( 5 ) 27 . 5 ( 5 ) 7 . 5 1 . 5 Large Example 2 : The same pre to post change may produce different effect sizes based on the standard deviations present Pre Post Change Effect Size Magnitude 20 ( 5 ) 22 . 5 ( 5 ) 2 . 5 0 . 50 Small 20 ( 2 . 5 ) 22 . 5 ( 2 . 5 ) 2 . 5 1 . 00 Moderate 20 ( 1 . 7 ) 22 . 5 ( 1 . 7 ) 2 . 5 1 . 50 Large Example 3 : Different pre to post changes can produce the same effect sizes based on the standard deviations present Pre Post Change Effect Size Magnitude 20 ( 10 ) 25 ( 10 ) 5 0 . 50 Small 20 ( 5 ) 22 . 5 ( 5 ) 2 . 5 0 . 50 Small 20 ( 3 . 3 ) 21 . 6 ( 3 . 3 ) 1 . 6 0 . 50 Small Example 4 : Different post standard deviations can also alter the effect size when the pooled standard deviations are used Pre Post Change Effect Size Magnitude 20 ( 2 . 5 ) 20 ( 2 . 5 ) 22 . 5 ( 6 . 5 ) 22 . 5 ( 2 . 5 ) 2 . 5 2 . 5 0 . 50 1 . 00 Small Moderate All results are expressed in kg . Magnitude based inferences are based on those suggested by Rhea 2 for highly trained individuals . If the standard deviations are constant across groups , the effect size provides no additional information over what is detailed by the raw values themselves ( Example 1 ) . Aside from a larger magnitude of change , a greater effect size can be achieved by reducing the standard deviation ( Example 2 ) ; conversely , a larger standard deviation will reduce the magnitude of an effect size ( Example 3 ) . Additionally , the decision to use the pre - test standard deviation , or pooled pre - test and post - test standard deviation for the calculation of effect size can drastically impact the effect size ( Example 4 ) . 15 Table 2 .

Although the raw values demonstrate the same change , analyzing the percent change demonstrates a significantly greater effect in the experimental group , whereas the effect size favors the control group .
