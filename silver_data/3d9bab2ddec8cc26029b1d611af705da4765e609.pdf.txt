Plow 1 & Jun Qin 1 , 2 Dynamic communication between integrin - containing complexes ( focal adhesions , FAs ) and actin ﬁ laments is critical for regulating cell adhesion . Pseudokinase ILK plays a key role in this process but the underlying mechanism remains highly elusive . Here we show that by recruiting FA adaptors PINCH and Parvin into a heterotrimeric complex ( IPP ) , ILK triggers F - actin ﬁ lament bundling – a process known to generate force / mechanical signal to promote cytoskeleton reassembly and dynamic cell adhesion . Structural , biochemical , and functional analyses revealed that the F - actin bundling is orchestrated by two previously unrecognized WASP - Homology - 2 actin binding motifs within IPP , one from PINCH and the other from Parvin . Strikingly , this process is also sensitized to Mg - ATP bound to the pseudoactive site of ILK and its dysregulation severely impairs stress ﬁ bers formation , cell spreading , and migration .

The adhesion is mediated by hetero - dimeric ( α / β ) integrin transmembrane receptors that bind to ECM proteins . However , for cells to ﬁ rmly attach , ECM must physically connect to intracellular actin cytoskeleton via integrin - containing protein complexes called focal adhesions ( FAs ) 1 – 4 . Integrin - linked kinase ( ILK ) is one of the few evolutionarily conserved proteins found in FAs to critically control the FA assembly and integrin – actin connection 5 . Discovered two decades ago 6 , ILK was originally thought to act as a Ser / Thr kinase to phosphorylate integrin β cytoplasmic tail and other targets to promote the integrin – actin communication , regulating dynamic cell adhesion events such as cell spreading and migration 7 . However , sequence analysis suggested that despite containing kinase - like domain , ILK is a pseudokinase lacking several key active site residues 8 . This triggered extensive genetic 9 – 12 and structural 13 , 14 studies , which con ﬁ rmed that ILK is indeed a pseudokinase with distinct scaffolding ability to bind many pro - teins for regulating cell adhesion and migration 15 . Notably , ILK was found to form a tight obligate ternary complex with FA adaptors PINCH and Parvin ( termed IPP thereafter ) , which occurs early before the localization to FAs 16 . PINCH has two isoforms PINCH - 1 and PINCH2 , which both contain ﬁ ve LIM domains whereas Parvin has three isoforms , α - , β - , γ - Parvin , which all contain two calponin homology ( CH ) domains 5 , 7 , 15 . These isoforms form cell - type speci ﬁ c IPPs to regulate dynamic integrin – actin connection , dysfunctions of which were linked to many diseases including cancer , diabetes , and heart failure 5 , 7 , 15 , 17 , 18 . Detailed structural analyses revealed that the N - terminal ankyrin repeat domain ( ARD ) of ILK recognizes PINCH LIM1 19 – 22 , whereas C - terminal kinase - like domain ( KLD ) of ILK speci ﬁ cally binds Parvin CH2 ( Fig . 1a ) 13 , 14 , 22 , thereby allowing the tight IPP complex formation 13 . While ILK is now widely recognized as the pseudokinase 15 , 18 , 23 , a fundamental issue still remains unre - solved : without catalytic function , how could ILK mediate the integrin – actin communication to promote diverse cell adhesive processes ? ILK is clearly indispensable for this dynamic signaling event as evidenced by mounting genetic and cell biological data 5 , 7 , 15 , 17 , 23 . In this study , we have undertaken a combination of structural , biochemical , and cell biological studies to address this issue . Our results reveal that by recruiting FA adaptors PINCH and Parvin into a heterotrimeric complex ( IPP ) , ILK is able to trigger F - actin ﬁ lament bundling via two WASP - Homology - 2 actin - binding motifs , one from PINCH and the other from Parvin . We further show that this process is sensitized to Mg - ATP bound to the pseudoactive site of ILK and its dys - regulation severely impairs stress ﬁ bers formation , cell spreading , and migration . Our data identify a crucial mechanism for ILK , highlighting its uniqueness as a pseudokinase to transduce non - catalytic signal and regulate cell adhesion . Results IPP binds to F - actin via an unexpected manner . To address the above issues , we decided to focus on IPP — the major functional form of ILK crucial for the integrin – actin connection 5 , 7 , 15 , 17 , 18 . To begin with , we decided to examine a hypothesis that IPP physically connects integrin and actin ﬁ laments to promote mechanical regulation of integrin – actin linkage . This hypothesis was derived from the data suggesting that ILK KLD contains the integrin binding site 6 and Parvin contains putative F - actin - binding CHs 5 , 15 , 18 . However , while ILK KLD indeed binds integrin β cytoplasmic tails 6 , 13 , puri ﬁ ed CH1 – CH2 of α - Parvin had essentially no interaction with F - actin in our co - sedimentation assay ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) . CH domains in Parvin have sequences that diverge signi ﬁ cantly from typical F - actin binding CH domain 24 , suggesting that they may have evolved to become nonactin - binding modules , e . g . , Parvin CH2 was shown to bind paxillin and ILK 13 , 25 . Given the crucial role of IPP in actin cytoskeleton , we then wondered if IPP would engage F - actin via other regions of the complex . To test this possibility , 325 1 WH2 WH2 1 1 ILK CH1 CH2 372 452 Pseudokinase Ankyrin LIM5 LIM4 LIM3 LIM2 LIM1 PINCH a α - Parvin 300 – 670 K – 158 K – 44 K – 17 K 200 A 280 ( m A U ) 100 0 8 10 12 14 16 Elution volume ( mL ) 18 20 23 30 46 58 80 175kDa M ILK PINCH b α - Parvin 5 . 6 Concentration ( μ M ) ILK Parvin F - actin PINCH Concentration ( μ M ) ILKBSA Parvin F - actin PINCH P IPP S S S S S S M P P P P P P S S S S S S S M P P P P P P 2 . 8 1 . 4 0 . 7 – 4 . 2 5 . 6 Control 2 . 8 1 . 4 0 . 7 4 . 2 IPP + F - actin 75 46 25 kDa 135 75 46 25 kDa c α - Actinin Fig . 1 IPP interaction with F - actin . a Schematic organization of IPP based on structural data .

Size exclusion chro - matography revealed that the three proteins co - eluted at an expected molecular mass ( ~ 133 kDa ) corresponding to the tight ternary IPP complex with relatively elongated stokes radius ( Fig . 1b ) . Interestingly , intact IPP complex potently associated with F - actin ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Figure 1B ) . These data thus indicate that IPP binds to F - actin yet in a previously unrecognized manner . IPP binds F - actin via two WH2 motifs in PINCH and Parvin . To understand the molecular basis of the IPP - actin binding , we set out to perform systematic biochemical and structural analyses . We ﬁ rst carried out the standard co - sedimentation experiments on each IPP subunit to examine their individual F - actin - binding capacity . Full - length ILK exhibits no binding to F - actin ( Sup - plementary Figure 1C ) , but interestingly , both full - length PINCH - 1 ( Supplementary Figure 1D ) and α - Parvin bind to F - actin ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) . This result suggested that IPP engages F - actin via a dual binding mode involving PINCH and Parvin , respectively . To further examine this potential binding mode , we employed de ﬁ nitive NMR - based 1 H - 15 N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy ( HSQC ) to map the actin - binding domains within PINCH or Parvin . We ﬁ rst used nonpolymerizable G - actin mutant ( A204E / P243K , termed AP - actin hereafter ) 26 to examine the actin - binding properties of PINCH or Parvin . The nonpolymerizable AP - actin has the size of ~ 40 kDa suitable for NMR - based binding experiments whereas wild - type G - actin can readily polymerize into large F - actin polymer at concentrations ( > 10 μ M ) typically used in NMR experiments . We divided PINCH - 1 into three domain fragments : LIM1 - 2 , LIM3 - 4 , and LIM5 - T containing the C - terminal tail . 15 N - labeled PINCH - 1 LIM1 - 2 and LIM3 - 4 showed no spectral change upon addition of unlabeled AP - actin ( Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B ) , but 15 N - labeled PINCH LIM5 - T exhibited substantial spectral perturbation upon addition of unlabeled AP - actin , demonstrating that the G - actin - binding site is localized in LIM5 - T ( Fig . 2a ) . Next , we examined if LIM5 - T also binds F - actin . As expected , the co - sedimentation assay showed that LIM5 - T also bound to F - actin ( Fig . 2b ) . By contrast , LIM5 alone without the C - terminal tail did not interact with F - actin ( Fig . 2b ) , indicating that the major actin - binding site is localized in the PINCH - 1 C - terminal tail . To further examine the molecular details of the LIM5 - T / actin interaction , we determined the solu - tion NMR structure of LIM5 - T ( Table 1 ) . Figure 2c reveals a canonical LIM fold for LIM5 that contains two zinc ﬁ nger motifs followed by a short C - terminal helix ( H1 , K301 - K306 ) , which is very similar to other previously reported PINCH - 1 LIM1 ( PDB code 3F6Q , RMSD 3 . 5 Å between 49 equivalent C α atoms of LIM5 residues V251 - E305 and Lim1 A192 - Q246 ) and LIM4 ( PDB code 1U5S , RMSD 1 . 5 Å between 52 equivalent C α atoms of LIM5 residues V250 - E304 and LIM4 I192 - Q246 ) structures ( Supplementary Figure 2C ) . Interestingly , the C - terminal tail beyond LIM5 also contains a helix ( H2 , L309 - T321 ) that packs against both zinc ﬁ ngers of LIM5 , leading to a variant of the LIM fold ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Figure 2C ) . The residues that underwent signi ﬁ cant spectral changes are marked in Fig . 2a , which are all clustered on a surface encompassed by H2 and the loop ( F307 – P308 ) connecting to H1 in LIM5 . Mutation of four strongly perturbed residues F307A , L311A , K312A , and K313A ( termed PINCH - 4A ) in the PINCH - 1 C - terminal tail ( Fig . 2c ) substantially reduced the LIM5 - T binding to AP - actin ( Fig . 2d ) and F - actin ( Fig S2D vs . Supplementary Figure 2E ) , further demonstrating that the C - terminal tail is the major actin - binding site . Having determined the actin - binding capability of PINCH - 1 C - terminal tail , we next wondered if it belongs to any known actin - binding motifs . Interestingly , sequence comparison revealed that the PINCH tail falls into a loosely conserved WASP - Homology 2 ( WH2 ) motif that is known to sequester G - actin 27 , 28 . Depending on the copy number and speci ﬁ c biochemical conditions , WH2 was also known to regulate F - actin assembly , e . g . , promoting actin nucleation and elongation 27 , 28 and bundling 29 , 30 , probably by binding to the G - actin unit of F - actin ﬁ lament . WH2 motif was suggested to have a consensus sequence of R - ALL - - I - - G - - - - - LKKV based on 50 % of 100 representative WH2 domains 27 . The PINCH - 1 C - terminus contains a sequence Y304 ( hydrophobic ) - - F ( hydro - phobic ) - - - LKK similarly seen in the proposed WH2 consensus sequence ( Fig . 3a ) . Consistently , mutations of F307 - - - LKK in this WH2 - like motif to A - - - AAA signi ﬁ cantly reduced the G - actin binding ( Fig . 2d ) and F - actin binding ( Supplementary Figure 2E ) , suggesting that the PINCH - 1 WH2 - like motif binds to actin in a manner similar to known WH2s 27 . To further investigate this possibility , we performed HSQC experiments of 15 N - labeled known WH2 protein thymosin - β 4 in the absence and presence of G - actin , which revealed a well - folded thymosin - β 4 when bound to G - actin ( Supplementary Figure 3A ) . However , addition of unlabeled LIM5 - T into the thymosin - β 4 / G - actin mixture led to a spectrum that is nearly identical to the free form thymosin - β 4 ( Supplementary Figure 3A ) , indicating that thymosin - β 4 and LIM5 - T compete for binding to a shared G - actin - binding site due to the presence of WH2 motif in both proteins . We note that many residues of H1 - loop - H2 of LIM5 - T WH2 underwent dramatic line - broadening ( K306 , F307 , and L309 - K313 ) or chemical shift changes ( R314 – G323 ) upon addition of G - actin , indicating that this structural motif is signi ﬁ cantly involved in binding to G - actin ( Fig . 2a ) in a manner similar to other WH2 / G - actin complexes , e . g . , the recent high - resolution structure of Bud6 / G - actin complex , where Bud6 WH2 also has helix - loop - helix to interact with G - actin 31 . To map the actin - binding site on Parvin , we also performed the HSQC experiments on 15 N - labeled α - Parvin fragments in the absence and presence of AP - actin . Consistent with our earlier co - sedimentation analysis ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) where α - Parvin CH1 – CH2 exhibited little binding to F - actin , α - Parvin CH1 – CH2 had little interaction with G - actin ( Supplementary Figure 3B ) . Since full - length α - Parvin bound to F - actin ( Supplementary Figure 1A and also see ref . 32 ) , we wondered if N - terminal region 1 – 91 ( α - Parvin - N ) outside the Parvin CH1 – CH2 might be responsible for the actin binding . Figure 3b shows that 15 N - labeled α - Parvin - N underwent substantial spectral change on a selective set of residues upon addition of AP - actin ( Fig . 3b ) , indicating that α - Parvin - N does contain an actin - binding site . Co - sedimentation experiments showed that α - Parvin - N also associated with F - actin ( Fig . 3c ) . Remarkably , sequence analysis suggested that α - Parvin - N also contains a WH2 motif like PINCH - 1 LIM5 - T ( Fig . 3a ) . Mutation of the conserved residues L37 , R39 , R40 , K41 , and K42 into Ala ( named α - Parvin 5 A hereafter ) that contains the predicted actin - binding site 27 , 28 diminished the α - Parvin - N binding to AP - actin ( Fig . 3b ) , further con ﬁ rming the speci ﬁ c α - Parvin - N WH2 / G - actin interaction . Co - sedimentation assay showed that WT α - Parvin also binds F - actin at the K D ~ 21 μ M ( Supplementary Figure 3C ) , but as a comparison , the α - Parvin - N 5 A has signi ﬁ cantly reduced af ﬁ nity to F - actin ( K D ~ 49 μ M ) ( Supplementary Figure 3C ) . As expected , α - Parvin - N competes with PINCH LIM5 - T for binding to AP - actin ( Supplementary Figure 3E ) . Note that α - Parvin - N is largely NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06906 - 7 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 4465 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06906 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 3 unstructured based on its narrow chemical shift range ( Fig . 3b ) like thymosin β 4 ( Supplementary Figure 3A ) so its total structure determination was not pursued but the WH2 motif likely adopts helical conformation when bound to actin as shown by previous studies 27 , 28 . Indeed , the secondary structure prediction revealed that the α - Parvin - N WH2 ( Fig . 3a ) contains a helix - loop - helix structural motif ( Supplementary Figure 3F ) , which is similar to that of PINCH WH2 ( Figs . 2c and 3a ) . We note again that the WH2 sequences are loosely conserved , which exhibit a large range of actin - binding af ﬁ nities , e . g . , K D is ~ 52 nM for WAVE2 WH2 but ~ 53 μ M for Ciboulot D2 32 . WAVE2 WH2 is better aligned with the consensus sequence than Ciboulot D2 ( Fig . 3a ) , which appears to correlate with their actin af ﬁ nity strengths . Consis - tently , PINCH / Parvin WH2s are less well aligned with the consensus sequence and thus their actin - binding af ﬁ nities are closer to those of Ciboulot WH2s 32 . Different actin - binding af ﬁ nities may be required for regulation of actin assembly and dynamics . The sequences surrounding the WH2 motif in various WH2 - containing proteins may also contribute to their ability to bind G versus F - actin in an equilibrium fashion , which remains to be investigated . It also remains to be investigated whether the variable sequences in WH2s allow distinct regulatory functions of WH2 domains such as recognizing different proteins other than actin . 7 . 0 8 . 0 9 . 0 130 125 120 115 110 15 N , pp m 1H , ppm L315E320 K306 F307 R314 L309 T321 V292 F294 L322 G323 E310 L311 K313 K312 a 50 A A A A A B B B B B α - Actinin Actin Lim5 - T L i m 5 - T a l one L i m 5 - T + a c t i n α - A c t i n i n + a c t i n BSA + a c t i n L i m 5 + a c t i n 30 1510 b R314 K313 E310 L311 P308 F307 K312 C ter H1 H2 N ter c d 130 125 120 115 110 15 N , pp m 7 . 0 8 . 0 9 . 0 1H , ppm H1 H1 H1 H2 H2 C ter C ter N ter N ter Fig . 2 Mapping and structural analysis of the major actin binding site in PINCH - 1 . a Overall , 0 . 1 mM 1 H - 15 N HSQC of LIM5 - T in the absence ( black ) and presence ( red ) of 0 . 2 mM AP - actin showing that LIM5 - T binds to G - actin .

The data also suggest a structural basis as to how IPP binds to F - actin via a two - pronged mode . Sequence alignment of PINCH - 1 versus PINCH - 2 and major Parvin isoforms α - Parvin versus β - Parvin indicated that WH2 motif is present in these proteins ( Fig S3F ) , thus suggesting the conserved actin - binding mode by these IPP isoforms . γ - Parvin , which is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells 5 , lacks the N - terminal domain containing WH2 - like motif ( Supplementary Figure 3F ) . It remains to be investigated if γ - Parvin confers cell - speci ﬁ c function . IPP promotes formation of speci ﬁ c F - actin bundles via WH2s . Next , we wondered how the two - pronged IPP binding to F - actin ﬁ laments would regulate actin cytoskeleton assembly and cell adhesion dynamics . The WH2 motif is frequently found in tan - dem repeats , which can serve as seeding sites for initiating actin polymerization 27 , 28 . The scenario appears to be different for IPP where a single WH2 motif is located in both PINCH and Parvin , separated by ILK ( Fig . 1a ) . Nevertheless , to examine any potential effect of IPP on actin polymerization , we carried out standard pyrene - based actin polymerization assay ( Cytoskeleton , Inc ) . Supplementary Figure 4A shows that presence of IPP complex even in 1 : 1 ratio to G - actin did not have signi ﬁ cant effect on the actin polymerization . This contrasts to the extreme high potency of Arp2 / 3 to stimulate actin polymerization ( Arp2 / 3 : G - actin = 30 nM : 4 . 3 μ M = 1 : 143 ) ( Supplementary Figure 4A ) . Since both WH2 motifs of IPP complex interact with F - actin , we then wondered if both WH2 motifs can bind to different F - actin ﬁ laments simultaneously and hence induce the ﬁ lament bundling — a process well - known to generate force / mechanical signal for reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton and thereby triggering dynamic cell adhesion events such as cell spreading and migration 33 . To examine this possibility , we ﬁ rst used a low - speed sedimentation assay — a standard approach for examining F - actin bundles . Supplementary Figure 4B shows that IPP , but not the control buffer , indeed induced formation of F - actin bundles . However , such sedimentation experiments do not reveal mor - phology of the F - actin bundles and are also less effective for detecting small bundles . We therefore sought to use ﬂ uorescent microscopy to visualize and quantify the bundles . In this method , G - actin was polymerized in the absence and presence of IPP , and stained with Alexa488 - phalloidin . The sample was then placed on a 22 × 22 mm cover slip , and the area equal to 2 . 4 × 2 mm was scanned using a wide - ﬁ eld ﬂ uorescence microscope , which pro - vides a comprehensive view of F - actin bundles ( Supplementary Figure 4C ) . Figure 4a , b shows representative images of such scans . In the absence of IPP , the F - actin ﬁ laments network was uniform ( Fig . 4a ) . However , remarkably , in the presence of IPP , an abundant amount of F - actin bundles was observed ( Fig . 4b ) . A higher resolution image of a representative bundle by confocal microscopy is shown in Fig . 4c . By contrast , in the presence of either PINCH - 1 or α - Parvin alone , no F - actin bundles were observed ( Supplementary Figure 4D ) . These data demonstrate that IPP can utilize PINCH - 1 and α - Parvin WH2 motifs as two “ active hands ” to cross - link F - actin ﬁ laments and form the spe - ci ﬁ c bundles . To more de ﬁ nitively evaluate the importance of WH2 motifs in the IPP - induced F - actin bundling , we expressed and puri ﬁ ed IPP mutant ( IPP - 4A ) where PINCH - 1 LIM5 - T WH2 F307 , L311 , K312 , and K313 were mutated into Ala , which resulted in signi ﬁ cantly reduced binding of LIM5 - T to AP - actin ( Fig . 2d ) and F - actin ( Supplementary Figure 2E ) . Based on IPP - 4A , we also further expressed and puri ﬁ ed an IPP mutant ( IPP - 4A - 5A ) where α - Parvin WH2 L37 , R39 , R40 , K41 , and K42 were mutated to Ala ( Parvin - 5A ) to disrupt the binding of α - Parvin - N to G - actin ( Fig . 3b ) and F - actin ( Supplementary Figure 3C vs . Supplemen - tary Figure 3D ) . Thus , if we imagine PINCH and Parvin are two arms spatially separated by ILK , and the two WH2s in PINCH and Parvin are two hands that grab / cross - link F - actin ﬁ laments , IPP - 4A would impair one “ hand ” of IPP whereas IPP - 4A - 5A would impair both “ hands ” . As expected , IPP - 4A signi ﬁ cantly reduced F - actin bundling ( Fig . 4d ) as compared with WT IPP ( Fig . 4b ) . Figure 4e , f provides more quantitative illustration , showing that IPP - 4A led to the formation of less and smaller sized F - actin bundles than WT IPP . Suppementary Figure 4E shows IPP - 4A - 5A further reduced the effect as compared with IPP - 4A with essentially no F - actin bundles formed . These mutation - based data provide strong supporting evidence that the two WH2s in IPP cooperate to induce F - actin bundling . IPP regulates cellular stress ﬁ bers and adhesion dynamics . To evaluate the importance of the WH2 motifs in IPP - induced F - actin bundling in a cellular context , we ﬁ rst introduced EGFP - PINCH1 or the actin - binding defective EGFP - PINCH1 4 A mutant as well as EGFP alone into HEL cells , a well - established hematopoietic cell model to study integrin function and signaling 34 , 35 as regulated by ILK 36 . Transfected HEL cells were stimulated with 800 nM PMA for 10 min to induce integrin activation and plated onto immobilized ﬁ brinogen for 1 or 2 h . Cells were ﬁ xed and F - actin visualized with Alexa - 647 - phalloidin cells expressing EGFP - tagged constructs was identi ﬁ ed by EGFP ﬂ uorescence , and focal adhesions were identi ﬁ ed by vinculin staining . Cell area was determined by measuring 150 cells per each construct . Figure 5a , b shows that while the expression of WT PINCH1 promotes cell spreading , the expression of PINCH1 4A severely impaired it . PINCH1 4A likely competed with endogenous PINCH1 , replacing WT IPP with IPP - 4A that was Table 1 NMR and re ﬁ nement statistics for Lim5 - T Protein NMR distance and dihedral constraints 2375 Distance constraints 2263 Total NOE 2263 Intraresidue 422 InterresidueSequential ( | i – j | = 1 ) 627 Medium - range ( | i – j | < 4 ) 490 Long - range ( | i – j | > 5 ) 724 Intermolecular n / a Hydrogen bonds n / a Total dihedral angle restraints 112 ϕ 56 ψ 56 Structure statistics Violations ( mean and s . d . ) Distance constraints ( Å ) 0 . 01865 ±0 . 00162 Dihedral angle constraints ( ° ) 0 . 45826 ±0 . 05425 Max . dihedral angle violation ( ° ) 3 Max . distance constraint violation ( Å ) 0 . 3 Deviations from idealized geometry Bond lengths ( Å ) 0 . 00478 ± 0 . 00003 Bond angles ( ° ) 0 . 84656 ± 0 . 02087 Impropers ( ° ) 1 . 99750 ± 0 . 00512 Average pairwise r . m . s . deviation * * ( Å ) Heavy 1 . 013 ± 0 . 128 Backbone 0 . 590 ± 0 . 080 * * Pairwise r . m . s . deviation was calculated among 20 re ﬁ ned structures NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06906 - 7 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 4465 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06906 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 5 defective in F - actin - bundling activity and FA - actin connections , which then led to the disruption of stress ﬁ bers and inhibition of cell spreading . To elucidate this in more details and to also eliminate potential complication of endogenous PINCH1 on the PINCH1 4A effect , we created PINCH - 1 4A knock - in HeLa cells using the CRISPR / Cas9 technique ( Supplementary Figure 5A ) . The HeLa cells with PINCH - 1 4A exhibited dramatically impaired stress ﬁ bers and cell spreading ( Supplementary Fig - ure 5B , 5C ) . However , we noticed that the expression level of PINCH - 1 4A was very low as compared with that of WT HeLa cells ( Supplementary Figure 5E ) . Such low expression was also seen for a frame - shift - induced PINCH - 1 C - terminal deletion mutant ( stop codon after F307 , named as PINCH - Δ C ) ( Supple - mentary Figure 5F ) . We therefore transfected one PINCH - Δ C clone 2F5 with EGFP - PINCH constructs and sorted for cells with equal amount of GFP - WT PINCH1 and GFP - PINCH - 4A expression ( Supplementary Figure 5G ) . P1 fractions were then applied for 2 h cell spreading on ﬁ bronectin - coated coverslips . Figure 5c shows that expression of PINCH - 4A led to impaired FAs and stress ﬁ bers as compared with that of WT PINCH , although PINCH - 4A could still be recruited to FAs ( indicated by ILK staining ) as compared with the vector control . PINCH - 4A also led to the cell spreading defect ( Fig . 5d ) . We also generated α - Parvin knockout HeLa cell line using the CRISPR / Cas9 method . Expression of α - Parvin - 5A into the α - Parvin de ﬁ cient cells exhibited impaired stress ﬁ bers and cell spreading as com - pared with that of WT α - Parvin ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) .

Mg - ATP bound to ILK regulates IPP - mediated F - actin bund - ling . So far , we have shown that ILK speci ﬁ cally recruits PINCH and Parvin into the IPP machinery to trigger dynamic actin bundling . This is a quite signi ﬁ cant ﬁ nding since it provides a basis for understanding how ILK acts as a pseudokinase to pro - mote dynamic FA - actin communication and cytoskeleton reas - sembly . On the other hand , another major puzzle still remains unresolved , i . e . , what is the role of Mg - ATP bound to the ILK pseudoactive site ? Mg - ATP is known to be crucial for conven - tional kinase catalysis but was shown to have little effect either on the overall conformation of ILK or its interaction with Parvin 13 , 14 — a key step to form the IPP complex ( Fig . 1b ) . Point mutations such as K220M were previously made to disrupt ATP binding to ILK and cause cellular defects 12 , 37 but these mutations also par - tially impair the structural integrity / stability of ILK 14 , making it complicated to assess the role of Mg - ATP . To circumvent this problem , we carefully analyzed the ATP - binding residues in the pseudokinase domain of ILK structure and designed L207W mutation that does not affect the structural integrity but sterically occludes ATP binding to ILK . To validate our design , we ﬁ rst examined the propensity of the substitution by characterizing the recombinant ILK KLD L207W in complex with α - Parvin CH2 . The puri ﬁ ed ILK KLD L207W mutant complexed with α - Parvin CH2 was expressed in a soluble form similar to that of WT ILK / α - Parvin complex , as judged by its expression and gel ﬁ ltration pro ﬁ le ( Supplementary Figure 7A ) . Consistently , CD denatura - tion studies revealed that there was little change in the thermal melting temperature of the mutant ILK ( L207W ) complex ( Tm = 53 . 9 °C ) versus that of the wild - type complex ( Tm = 54 . 2 °C ) ( Supplementary Figure 7B ) , demonstrating that the L207W sub - stitution has little effect on the stability of ILK / Parvin complex . To further prove this , we solved the crystal structure of the ILK ( L207W ) / α - Parvin CH2 complex ( Table 2 ) , which showed that the mutant complex exhibits the same interface as the WT complex ( Supplementary Figure 7C ) , yet the substitution of L207 by more bulky side chain of tryptophan in the pseudokinase domain precluded the binding of ATP as well as Mg 2 + as expected ( Fig . 6a ) . The inability of the ATP binding by the mutant was further validated by ﬂ orescence - based measurement using MANT - ATP ( Supplementary Figure 7D ) . The mutation clearly abolished the ATP binding as well as Mg 2 + binding to ILK ( Supplementary Figure 7D ) .

Next , we examined the ability of IPP L207W mutant in affecting the F - actin bundle formation . Strikingly , as compared with WT IPP , loss of Mg - ATP in IPP L207W led to dramatically impaired F - actin bundling ( Fig . 6b vs . 6c ) with notable decrease in size of the formed F - actin bundles ( Fig . 6d ) . To examine the role of Mg - ATP bound to the ILK pseudoactive site on actin - dependent cellular functions , we expressed EGFP as a control , WT ILK or EGFP - ILK L207W in HEL cells ( Supplementary Figure 7E ) . Transfected HEL cells were treated and examined using the same conditions as we did for PINCH - 1 and PINCH - 1 4A mutants above . Figure 7a , b shows that the expression of ILK L207W signi ﬁ cantly impaired the cell spreading as compared with the WT ILK , which is consistent with the above biochemical data . We also examined how the L207W may affect cell migration that critically depends on actin cytos - keleton change . HeLa cells were transfected with EGFP vector , EGFP - ILK WT and EGFP - ILK L207W , respectively and then subjected to transwell migration assay . Figure 7c , d shows that while expression of WT ILK promotes cell migration , the expression of ILK L207W mutant led to signi ﬁ cantly reduced effect . To further elucidate the effect of this mutation in details and to also eliminate potential interference of endogenous ILK on the effect of ILK L207W mutation , we created ILK L207W knock - in mutation using the CRISPR / Cas9 method . Figure 8a shows that ILK L207W led to signi ﬁ cantly impaired stress ﬁ bers with no change in expression levels of WT ILK vs ILK L207W ( Fig . 8b ) , PINCH1 ( Fig . 8b ) , and Parvin ( Fig . 8b ) . The ILK L207W muta - tion also reduced FA number ( Fig . 8c ) while exerting no sig - ni ﬁ cant change on FA size ( Fig . 8d ) . Consequently , the mutation further reduced cell spreading ( Fig . 8e ) and migration ( Fig . 8f ) . It is important to note that like WT IPP , IPP L207W binds potently to F - actin ( Supplementary Figure 8A - C ) . By contrast , IPP L207W has dramatically reduced ability to bundle F - actin as compared with WT IPP ( Fig . 6b – d ) . These results suggest a crucial role of the Mg - ATP binding to ILK in regulating the F - actin bundling , which in turn controls the actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion dynamics .

Through a comprehensive set of biochemical , structural , microscopic , and cell biological experi - ments , we believe we have obtained important clues for addres - sing these fundamentally important questions . First , we found that by utilizing its pseudokinase domain to recognize Parvin and its ankyrin repeat domain to recognize PINCH , ILK forms the IPP complex to directly associate with F - actin ﬁ laments . This provides the de ﬁ nitive evidence of direct IPP - actin engagement . While IPP was previously widely hypo - thesized to engage F - actin via Parvin ’ s CH domains ( 5 , 15 , 18 ) , our results showed that it was not the case . Instead , the asso - ciation occurs in a two - pronged mode involving two previously unrecognized actin - binding WH2 motifs , one from PINCH and the other from Parvin . Remarkably , such two - pronged binding mode allows IPP to trigger the formation of speci ﬁ c F - actin bundles — a process well - known to generate force / mechanical signal for regulating cytoskeleton reassembly . WH2 is known to be a multifunctional actin - binding motif to sequester G - actin as well as promote F - actin assembly ( nucleation / elongation / bund - ling ) via distinct mechanisms 28 . In the case of IPP , the two WH2s each located in PINCH and Parvin likely bind G - actin unit of F - actin ﬁ laments to promote the F - actin cross - linking and bund - ling . Since IPP also binds integrin β cytoplasmic tail via the ILK pseudokinase domain without affecting the Parvin binding 13 , our data suggest a dynamic pathway by which ILK acts as the pseu - dokinase to uniquely engage two WH2s , thereby transducing non - catalytic mechanical force / signal from integrin - containing FAs to F - actin and leading to speci ﬁ c F - actin bundle formation . Such dynamic pathway allows the mechanistic understanding of extensive previous functional data 5 , 15 , 18 that had implicated the essential role of IPP to control cytoskeleton and diverse cytoskeleton - dependent cell adhesive processes such as cell shape change , cell migration , and proliferation . We note that there are several well characterized F - actin - bundling proteins in FAs such as talin , ﬁ lamin , and actinin , which also physically mediate integrin - FAs - actin linkage 1 – 4 . However , as we illustrated here , IPP has a distinct tripartite topology where ILK is sand - wiched by the WH2 - containing PINCH and Parvin , thereby allowing the formation of speci ﬁ c F - actin bundles to ﬁ ne - tune the stress ﬁ ber formation , cell shape , and cell motility . We also note that IPP binds to an array of other FA proteins , some of which may directly or indirectly bind to actin 15 , leading to more com - plex regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics . While such higher level regulation of the actin cytoskeleton remains to be further investigated , the results derived from this study have laid down a foundation for such investigation , signifying an important mile - stone for understanding ILK - mediated integrin – actin commu - nication and cell adhesion . Another major ﬁ nding of this study was that the IPP WH2 - mediated F - actin bundling is highly sensitized to Mg - ATP bound to the pseudoactive site of ILK . This was strongly demonstrated by our mutagenesis data at both biochemical and cellular levels . A large portion of pseudokinases binds ATP with largely unknown functional bases 38 . Previous studies have suggested that ATP might structurally stabilize a pseudokinase or induce its con - formational change , thereby altering the binding to and / or activity of its partner 38 . A de ﬁ nitive example is that ATP induces a conformational change of a pseudokinase STRAD - α ( no Mg 2 + involvement ) to activate downstream binding target LKB kinase 39 . However , Mg - ATP has little effect on the overall con - formation of ILK in complex with Parvin 13 , 14 . Thus , the Mg - ATP binding to ILK may adopt a totally different mechanism to reg - ulate the pseudokinase function , which remains to be determined . Nevertheless , our data at least unraveled an important phenomenon where the ILK bound Mg - ATP regulates the F - actin - ﬁ lament assembly , which in turn controls the actin cytos - keleton and diverse cytoskeleton - dependent cell adhesive and signaling events . In summary , we believe that our study marks a signi ﬁ cant advance for understanding the ILK function and many ILK - dependent physiological / pathological processes . Our data also shed light upon the ability of pseudokinases to evolve as distinct non - catalytic signal transducers . Since ILK or IPP is highly upregulated in multiple diseases , such as cancer , diabetes , and heart failure 5 , 7 , 15 , 17 , 18 , our ﬁ ndings also open the door for developing unique therapeutic inhibitors of ILK , not as a kinase , but as a pseudokinase , by targeting at its Mg - ATP site or its binding to other proteins .

The bacterially expressed and puri ﬁ ed ILK KLD ( either WT or L207W mutant ) in complex with α - Parvin CH2 was prepared at a ﬁ nal concentration of 1 μ M in the solution ( at a ﬁ nal volume of 80 μ L ) consisting of 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM either MgCl 2 or no cation , and 4 . 8 % glycerol in a 96 - well black ﬂ at - bottom microplate ( Greiner Bio - One ) . MANT - ATP ( Life Technologies ) was titrated in the reaction solution . The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature at 150rpm for 10 min , and the ﬂ uorescence intensity was measured on a 2300 EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader ( PerkinElmer ) with excitation ( 280nm ) and emission ( 430nm ) wave - lengths . The ﬂ uorescence signal was normalized by subtracting the background ﬂ uorescence of the MANT - ATP buffer , and plotted as a function of the con - centration of MANT - ATP . The binding constant of MANT - ATP to ILK KLD was estimated by one - site total binding ﬁ t model using the program GraphPad Prism . The binding results were obtained in two - independent experiments performed in duplicate . CD - based thermal shift assay . CD measurements were performed with AVIV - 215 equipped with a computer controller Peltier sample holder . All measurements were taken in a 1mm pathlength cell with sample concentration at 0 . 2 mg mL − 1 . The thermal stability of wild type and L207W mutant was monitored at 222 nm by heating samples at a rate of 60 °C h − 1 over the range of 10 – 70 °C . The ellipticity was recorded at 0 . 5 °C intervals with time constant of 16 s . The data were analyzed by Origin 2017 . F - actin co - sedimentation assay . The F - actin - binding experiments were per - formed according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol ( Cytoskeleton , Inc . ) .

Test proteins were precleared in the same way . Then G - actin was polymerized by addition of salts ( 50 mM KCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 1mM ATP ) and the actin solution was incubated at room temperature for 1h . The test proteins were added in the F - actin buffer only ( either with 5 % glycerol or no glycerol ) and the F - actin stock , and then incubated at room temperature for 30min . The reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 150 , 000xg at 4 °C for 1h in Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge ( Beckman ) , and the supernatants and the pellets were carefully fractionated . Both the pellets and the supernatants were analyzed by SDS - PAGE , and the gels were stained by Coomassie Brilliant . The densitometric quanti ﬁ cation of the bands in the pellets was performed by ImageJ software ( NIH ) . Normalized binding data with blank subtraction were obtained by dividing the values of pelleted fractions of a protein by the maximum value of the protein in the pellet at saturation , and plotted as a function of the protein concentration . Curve ﬁ tting and K D calculation were performed by GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Soft - ware , Inc ) . Pyrenyl - actin polymerization .
