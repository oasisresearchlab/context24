A stable - inducible cell line to study GPI - anchored protein quality control . ( A ) HEK293 - TRex cells containing either GFP - PrP or GFP - PrP * stably integrated at the same locus were induced to express the proteins with doxycycline for 48 hr prior to analysis by immunoblotting using anti - GFP antibody . Cultures without doxycycline induction were analyzed in parallel . Two exposures of the immunoblot are shown , along with a portion of the stained blot verifying equal loading . Unglycosylated ( ‘no glyc . ” ) , core - glycosylated ( ‘core’ ) , and complex - glycosylated ( ‘complex’ ) species of GFP - PrP are indicated . ( B ) Cells expressing GFP - PrP or GFP - PrP * were induced with doxycycline for 96 hr prior to analysis of GFP fluorescence by flow cytometry . The normalized histograms are shown . ( C ) Cells expressing GFP - PrP or GFP - PrP * were induced for 48 hr with doxycycline , washed to remove doxycycline , then analyzed 24 hr later by fluorescent microscopy . Doxycycline withdrawal for 24 hr limited the amount of reporter mRNA in cells to relatively moderate levels , and was employed in most of the experiments in this study . This minimized over - expression artifacts and improved reproducibility . ( D ) Cells expressing GFP - PrP or GFP - PrP * were treated with vehicle ( DMSO ) or the ER stressor thapsigargin ( Tg , at 100 nM ) for 3 hr in the presence of 100 m g / ml cycloheximide to suppress new protein synthesis . 250 nM bafilomycin A1 ( BafA1 ) was included in one set of samples .

Characterization of Nb surface staining and isolation . ( A ) Cells expressing GFP - PrP were incubated on ice with varying concentrations of Alexa647 - Nb , washed , and analyzed for Alexa647 fluorescence by flow cytometry . ( B ) GFP - PrP * on the cell surface was labeled on ice with Nb - FLAG , washed , and lysed under non - denaturing conditions . The lysate was then mixed with lysate from cells transfected with cytosolic GFP . The nanobody was subsequently immunoprecipitated ( IP ) via its FLAG epitope tag . The input , unbound and IP samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting using anti - GFP antibodies . No cytosolic GFP was recovered in the IP , illustrating that the Nb bound to surface GFP - PrP * does not exchange antigens after solubilization and during the IP . ( C ) GFP - PrP - expressing cells were incubated without or with extracellular trypsin to digest surface - localized proteins . The left panel shows the level of total GFP fluorescence analyzed by flow cytometry relative to uninduced cells . In the right panel , the trypsin - digested or undigested samples were surface labeled with fluorescent Nb and analyzed by flow cytometry . Note that surface GFP - PrP was quantitatively digested by trypsin as indicated by the fact that these cells show no detectable Nb fluorescence relative to cells that were not labeled with Nb . Thus , we can deduce that the remaining GFP fluorescence in the trypsin - digested cells seen in the left panel is due to the intracellular population of GFP - PrP .

Additional characterization of GFP - PrP * trafficking . ( A ) Cells expressing GFP - PrP * ( or uninduced controls ) were allowed to internalize Alexa546 - Nb for 3 hr , after which the cells were washed , put into Nb - free medium , and further cultured for the indicated times . Nb fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry at each time point and the median fluorescence intensity is plotted . Note that no appreciable Nb uptake is seen in uninduced cells expressing minimal amounts of GFP - PrP * , and that the fluorescence of internalized Nb does not change appreciably over the course of 3 hr . ( B ) GFP - PrP * - expressing cells were treated without or with siRNAs targeting TMED10 ( siTMED10 ) , and transfected with a control vector or one expressing siRNA - resistant HA - TMED10 .

A subset of knockdown cells was also transfected with siRNA - resistant HA - TMED10 ( rescue ) . Each of these cells , along with untreated HEK293T cells ( HEK ) were treated for 2 hr with 100 nM thapsigargin in the presence of extracellular Alexa546 - Nb . Fluorescent nanobody uptake was measured by flow cytometry . ( D ) The levels of TMED10 in unedited ( wild type ) and CRISPR - edited TMED10 - knockout ( TMED10 KO ) cells was assessed by immunoblotting ( using an antibody against the lumenal domain ) . The KO lysate was compared to serial dilutions of control lysate to verify that no TMED10 was detectable in the KO cells even with over - exposure of the blot . ( E ) WT and D TMED10 cells ( see panel D ) expressing GFP - PrP * were imaged by fluorescence microscopy at the indicated times after treatment with 100 nM thapsigargin to induce acute ER stress . Unlike in wild type cells , GFP - PrP * in D TMED10 cells remains in the ER over this time frame .

In addition , the KO cells were transiently transfected with HA - tagged TMED10 lacking its coiled - coil domain ( D CC ) and the transfected cells were analyzed in parallel . ( B ) RFP - tagged wild type ( WT ) TMED10 , or constructs lacking the GOLD domain ( residues 41 – 129 ; D GOLD ) or coiled - coil domain ( residues 130 – 183 ; D CC ) were transiently transfected into D TMED10 cells inducibly expressing GFP - PrP * . GFP - PrP * was either left uninduced or induced for 48 hr prior to analysis . GFP - PrP * was immunoprecipitated using sepharose - conjugated anti - GFP Nb and analyzed by immunoblotting for GFP and RFP relative to input lysates . All input samples are from the same blot and exposure , with the vertical line indicating where intervening lanes were removed . All of the IP samples are also from the same blot and exposure .

Despite a similar molecular weight , native TMED10 peaks in fraction five indicating its constitutive engagement in a higher molecular weight complex . For comparison , CNX ( ~ 90 kDa monomer ) peaks in fraction 4 , while the transferrin receptor ( TfnR , dimer of two 85 kDa polypeptides ) peaks in fractions 6 – 8 . This suggests that native TMED10 is part of a ~ 100 – 125 kD complex . ( B ) Wild type ( WT ) cells , TMED10 knockout ( KO ) cells , KO cells transiently transfected with RFP - tagged TMED10 , and HEK293 cells were assayed for their ability to internalize fluorescent nanobody for 1 hr in the presence of thapsigargin - induced ER stress . Nanobody fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry . RFP - tagged TMED10 is able to partially rescue nanobody internalization in D TMED10 cells . ( C ) GFP - PrP * - expressing cells lacking endogenous TMED10 ( KO ) were transiently transfected with myc - tagged TMED2 and assayed for their ability to internalize fluorescent nanobody for 2 hr in the presence of thapsigargin - induced ER stress . TMED2 cannot rescue the Nb - uptake deficiency of D TMED10 cells , and seems to even have a slight dominant - negative effect ( i . e . , further reduced Nb uptake ) . ( D ) Cells expressing GFP - PrP * were depleted of the indicated TMED family members using two independent siRNA oligonucleotides for 72 hr , and subsequently assayed for their ability to internalize fluorescent nanobody from the medium over a 100 min time period under non - stressed conditions . Although not shown here , no effect was seen for siRNA - treated TMED1 , TMED3 , TMED4 , and TMED6 . ( E ) Knockdown efficiencies for panel D were checked by immunoblotting for TMED2 , TMED7 , and TMED9 . We were unable to obtain a suitable antibody for TMED5 .

The x - axis orders proteins by relative abundance in the immunoprecipitation ( one being the most abundant ) , and the y - axis plots the Log 2 value of the WT / KO ratio of abundances . Proteins whose Log 2 ratios are > 0 . 5 in all three independent experiments are highlighted in red , and those > 0 . 5 in 2 of 3 independent experiments are highlighted in blue .

HEK293T cells lacking GFP - PrP * were used as a specificity control ( HEK ) . The positions of several abundant proteins identified by mass spectrometry are indicated . The portion of the gel showing the TMED family members is also shown at higher contrast . All eight IP samples ( not including the HEK control ) were subjected to quantitative tandem mass tagging ( TMT ) mass spectrometry ( Figure 5—source data 1 ) .

Cell surface PrP * is associated with ER - derived factors . ( A ) Cells expressing GFP - PrP and GFP - PrP * were labeled on ice with saturating levels of extracellular Nb - FLAG , lysed under non - denaturing conditions , and separated by size on a 5 – 25 % sucrose gradient . Fractions were immunoblotted with anti - GFP to detect total cellular GFP - PrP and GFP - PrP * , and anti - FLAG to detect surface - localized Nb complexes . Size standards are estimates based on migration of known proteins on such gradients , which migrate reproducibly from experiment to experiment . ( B ) GFP - PrP * - expressing cells and control HEK293T cells were surface labeled and lysed as in panel A and affinity purified via the FLAG epitope tag on the Nb . Elutions were separated by SDS - PAGE and stained with SYPRO - Ruby , with key proteins indicated on the right . ( C ) Cells expressing GFP - PrP and GFP - PrP * were surface labeled such that equal amounts of anti - GFP Nb - FLAG coated the surface of these two cells . This was accomplished by using saturating ( 200 nM ) Nb for GFP - PrP * cells and 2 nM Nb for GFP - PrP cells . These values were determined in preliminary titration experiments . Surface - localized GFP - PrP and GFP - PrP * were then affinity purified as in panel B , the samples were separated by SDS - PAGE , and subjected to immunoblotting as indicated .

Characterization of cell surface GFP - PrP * complexes . ( A ) Cells expressing GFP - PrP or GFP - PrP * were labeled on ice with saturating levels of Nb - FLAG , washed , and lysed under non - denaturing conditions . The Nb - FLAG complexes were immunopurified via the FLAG epitope tag , eluted under native conditions using FLAG peptide , and separated by size on a 5 – 25 % sucrose gradient . Fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and detected by SYPRO - Ruby stain . Size standards are estimates based on migration of known proteins on such gradients , which migrate reproducibly from experiment to experiment . An aliquot of the total IP is shown in the last lane , with key proteins and the Nb indicated . Asterisks represent the major contaminants found in both samples . As expected , far more GFP - PrP ( and associated Nb ) is recovered than GFP - PrP * , consistent with the former being present on the surface at ~ 20 fold higher levels . ( B ) Cells expressing GFP - PrP or GFP - PrP * were surface labeled with Nb - FLAG , washed , lysed under non - denaturing conditions , and affinity purified via the FLAG epitope tag . The elutions were separated by SDS - PAGE and detected with SYPRO - Ruby stain . The two lanes corresponding to GFP - PrP and GFP - PrP * are from the same gel and exposure , with the vertical line indicating where intervening lanes removed . ( C ) GFP - PrP * - expressing cells and control HEK293 cells were labeled on ice with saturating levels of Nb - FLAG and washed . In parallel , GFP - PrP * - expressing cells were radiolabelled with 35 S - methionine for 1 hr and collected . The Nb - labelled and radiolabelled cells were mixed 1 : 1 , lysed under non - denaturing conditions , and affinity purified via the FLAG epitope tag . Elutions were separated by SDS - PAGE and detected with SYPRO - Ruby stain ( top panel ) and autoradiography ( bottom panel ) . Note that recovery of radiolabeled proteins was very low and the pattern of radiolabelled proteins was identical in the two samples . This indicates that the unlabeled GFP - PrP * ( visible in the stained gel ) does not appear to bind radiolabeled proteins after lysis .

Cell lysates were analyzed for biotinylated proteins by blotting with streptavidin - HRP . The few prominent bands seen at the 0 time point are endogenous biotin - modified proteins .

The cells were then lysed and analyzed for biotinylated proteins by blotting with streptavidin - HRP .
