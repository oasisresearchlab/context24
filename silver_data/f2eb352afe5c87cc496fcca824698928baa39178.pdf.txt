Here , we report an unexpected function of this N - BAR domain protein BIN1 in filopodia formation . We demonstrated that BIN1 expression is necessary and sufficient to induce filopodia formation . BIN1 is present at the base of forming filopodia and all along filopodia , where it colocalizes with F - actin . We identify that BIN1 - mediated filopodia formation requires IRSp53 , which allows its localization at negatively - curved membrane topologies . Our results show that BIN1 bundles actin in vitro . Finally , we identify that BIN1 regulates the membrane - to - cortex architecture and functions as a molecular platform to recruit actin - binding proteins , dynamin and ezrin , to promote filopodia formation . 2 Introduction Cellular morphologies powered by the actin cytoskeleton are essential to support de - velopmental processes and cellular functions . Among the actin - driven structures pro - duced by cells , filopodia assist relevant processes such as axonal guidance , establi - shing neuronal synapses , zippering of epithelial sheets , or myoblast fusion ( Chen , 2011 ; Abmayr and Pavlath , 2012 ; Gallop , 2020 ) . Filopodia are specialized 60 - 200 nm diameter finger - like structures made of paired actin filaments of a few to hundred mi - crons in length ( Mattila and Lappalainen , 2008 ; Svitkina , 2018 ) . The remodeling of the membrane / actin interface plays a central role in the formation and shape mainte - nance of filopodia . This function is driven by modular proteins that connect actin mi - crofilaments with the plasma membrane , typically via phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bis - phosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) - rich interfaces , as in the case of ezrin - radixin - moesin ( ERM ) domain proteins ( Fievet et al . , 2004 ; Garbett et al . , 2013 ; Tsai et al . , 2018 ) , or the in - verse - Bin1 - Amphiphysin - Rvs ( I - BAR ) domain protein IRSp53 ( Disanza et al . , 2013 ; Prévost et al . , 2015 ) . Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) domain proteins are multi - functional effectors characte - rized by a modular architecture consisting of an intrinsically curved membrane - bin - ding BAR domain followed by auxiliary domains mediating protein - protein interac - tions and Rho GTPase signaling domains ( Itoh and Decamilli , 2006 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2010 ) . One of the most prevalent auxiliary domains is the Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) ( Carman and Dominguez , 2018 ) , and in many BAR domain proteins , it binds directly with cytoskeletal assembly factors and the dynamin GTPase ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Fergu - son et al . , 2009 ; Falcone et al . , 2014 ; D’Alessandro et al . , 2015 ) . Despite the role of dynamin in endocytosis ( Daumke et al . , 2014 ) , recent works support its central func - tion as a multi - filament actin - bundling protein that propels cellular protrusions during myoblast fusion ( Chuang et al . , 2019 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . Indeed , dense F - actin struc - tures at the myoblast fusion site facilitate the formation of protrusions , allowing cell membrane juxtaposition that powers the mechanical forces required for cell - cell fu - sion and undergo myoblast differentiation ( Sens et al . , 2010 ; Kim et al . , 2015 ) . Ho - wever , what precisely controls dynamin recruitment to initiate the formation of actin - rich protrusions at the plasma membrane remain unclear . 3 In skeletal muscle cells , the N - BAR domain protein BIN1 / Amphiphysin 2 is a major binding partner of dynamin ( Kojima et al . , 2004 ; Nicot et al . , 2007 ) , and its expres - sion appears highly induced during skeletal muscle differentiation ( Wechsler - Reya et al . , 1998 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ) . Indeed , the perturbed BIN1 - dynamin interaction is the cause of centronuclear myopathies ( CNMs ) , a heterogeneous group of inherited mus - cular disorders characterized by fiber atrophy and muscle weakness ( Nicot et al . , 2007 ; Fugier et al . , 2011 ) . Interestingly , the muscle - specific BIN1 isoform ( BIN1 iso - form 8 ) , in contrast to the other BIN1 / amphiphysin isoforms , displays a phosphoinosi - tide ( PI ) - binding motif responsible for its targeting to the plasma membrane , mainly by interacting with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) . We previously showed that BIN1 lo - cally increases the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density to recruit dynamin on membranes selectively ( Pi - cas et al . , 2014 ) . Moreover , the PI domain controls a conformational switch that facil - itates BIN1 SH3 domain interaction with dynamin ( Kojima et al . , 2004 ; Wu and Baumgart , 2014 ) , and to other BIN1 partners such as the neuronal Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( N - WASP ) protein that regulates actin polymerization through the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Yamada et al . , 2009 ; Falcone et al . , 2014 ; D’Alessandro et al . , 2015 ) . Fur - thermore , in vitro and in cellulo approaches have shown that neuronal and muscle - specific BIN1 isoforms directly bind F - actin ( D’Alessandro et al . , 2015 ; Dräger et al . , 2017 ) . However , it is unknown how BIN1 remodels the plasma membrane / actin inter - face and whether it fulfills a functional role in forming actin - rich protrusion . Here , we report that BIN1 is a multi - functional platform to promote filopodia forma - tion in myoblasts . Our results show that BIN1 assembles actin bundles in vitro . We also identified new BIN1 - binding partners , including IRSp53 and ezrin , during filo - podia formation . We show that BIN1 regulates the membrane - to - cortex mechanics , and it is required to recruit active phosphorylated ezrin at filopodia . Thus , we propose that BIN1 constitutes a functional membrane and actin - remodeling scaffold that , unexpectedly , as an N - BAR domain protein , orchestrates antagonistic membrane to - pologies at the cell cortex , such as the formation of filopodia . 4 Results BIN1 expression is necessary and sufficient for filopodia - like structure formation The association of different BIN1 / Amphiphysin2 isoforms with F - actin and actin reg - ulators such as the neuronal Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( N - WASP ) ( Falcone et al . , 2014 ; D’Alessandro et al . , 2015 ; Dräger et al . , 2017 ) , prompt us to investigate if BIN1 proteins participate in actin - rich structure formation . Therefore , we expressed in HeLa cells GFP and several GFP - tagged amphiphysin isoforms : amphiphysin1 ( typically associated with clathrin - coated structures ) ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) , the largest BIN1 isoform ( BIN1 iso1 , expressed in neurons ) , and the muscle - speciﬁc isoform BIN1 ( BIN1 iso8 ) , which contains the in - frame exon 11 encoding a polybasic motif binding phosphoinositides ( PIs ) ( Prokic et al . , 2014 ) , and stained F - actin . We ob - served that BIN1 iso8 drastically enhanced ﬁlopodia - like structure density , whereas BIN1 iso1 and Amphiphysin1 led to a low to null increase in ﬁlopodia - like structure density , respectively ( Fig . 1A ) . To inquiry into the molecular mechanisms of BIN1 - mediated filopodia - like structure formation , we turned out to myoblast cells because actin protrusions have been impli - cated in the adhesion and fusion of muscle cells ( Segal et al . , 2016 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ) and BIN1 expression increases during myoblast differentiation ( Fig . 1B ) ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) . To this end , we generated C2C12 myoblast expressing specific short in - terfering RNA ( shRNA ) against Bin1 or luciferase ( CTRL shRNA ) to ensure a ho - mogenous knock - down of Bin1 in the myoblast cell population . In undifferentiated Bin1 shRNA C2C12 cells , depletion of BIN1 expression was almost complete ( Fig . 1C ) . We then performed a detailed analysis of the cellular morphology of control and C2C12 Bin1 shRNA myoblasts by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) either under proliferative conditions and at 80 - 90 % conﬂuence to favor the formation of cell - cell junctions preceding myoblast differentiation and fusion . Furthermore , BIN1 depletion was associated with reduced membrane extensions between cells and a smoother dor - sal plasma membrane ( Fig . 1D - contacting cells and Fig . S1A - isolated cells ) . This phenotype was evident at the cell periphery and cell - cell junctions , indicating that BIN1 might participate in adjoining myoblasts ' intercellular zippering . Conversely , we observed a dense interface of ﬁlopodia - like membrane protrusions interconnecting two or more adjacent myoblasts in control cells . In Bin1 knock - down cells , the protru - 5 sion densities are signiﬁcantly decreased ( 3 . 6 - fold reduction in ﬁlopodia - like structure density , Fig . 1E ) . These results show that in myoblasts , BIN1 depletion affects the morphology and the number of ﬁlopodia - like structure at cell - cell junctions and at the cell periphery ( i . e . , away from intercellular junctions ) . Next , we analyzed BIN1 localization by multi - color life - cell imaging of C2C12 cells co - expressing Lifeact - mCherry and BIN iso8 . We showed that at the cell periphery BIN1 co - localized with actin at ﬁlopodia - like structures ( Fig . 1F ) . Furthermore , ky - mograph analysis of the GFP - BIN1 signal showed that it often precedes that of Life - act - mCherry ( blue arrowheads , Fig . 1F ) . Moreover , BIN1 signal is present during the initiation , extension , and retraction of ﬁlopodial actin ﬁlaments ( Fig . 1F ) . Altogether , these data show that BIN1 expression promotes ﬁlopodia - like structure formation and that BIN1 knockdown decreases these F - actin rich structures . Figure 1 .

BIN1 promotes actin bundling BIN1 iso1 was previously reported to bundle actin in vitro ( D’Alessandro et al . , 2015 ; Dräger et al . , 2017 ) and its N - BAR and SH3 domains share a strong homology with BIN1 iso8 ( Prokic et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , we sought to determine if the muscle - specific BIN1 iso8 also has the ability to associate and remodel F - actin . First , we performed a high - resolution analysis of BIN1 and F - actin using structured illumination mi - croscopy ( SIM ) imaging in C2C12 cells . The endogenous BIN1 staining ( Fig . 2A ) or expression of GFP - BIN1 iso8 ( Fig . 2B ) revealed that BIN1 is localized at the base of filopodia structures and displays a discontinuous labeling along these F - actin - rich structures . Consequently , we determined whether BIN1 localization in filopodia - like structures is related to its association with actin . Thus , we performed co - immunopre - cipitation experiments with GFP - tagged amphiphysin1 , BIN1 iso1 , and BIN1 iso8 ( Fig . 2C ) . Immuno - blotting showed that in cellulo , only BIN1 iso8 appears associated with actin . Next , we determined the contribution of the BIN1 N - terminal N - BAR and the C - terminal SH3 domain for its association with actin in cellulo ( Fig . 2D ) . To this end , we tested by co - immunoprecipitation the interaction with actin of the BIN1 D151N mutant , which carries a mutation in the N - BAR domain , which interferes with the curvature - sensing abilities and capacity to oligomerize ( Wu et al . , 2014 ) , and of 7 the BIN1 Δ SH3 mutant , which displays a truncated SH3 domain shown to prevent its interaction with cellular effectors ( Nicot et al . , 2007 ) or N - WASP ( Falcone et al . , 2014 ) . As shown in Fig . 2D , both mutants associate with actin in cellulo . The co - localization and association of BIN1 iso8 with actin in cellulo prompted us to determine the potential ability of BIN1 iso8 to remodel F - actin in vitro using an assay based on purified actin and BIN1 . We showed that BIN1 promotes actin filament - bundling ( Fig . 2E ) . Remarkably , the number of actin bundles increased with increas - ing BIN1 concentrations , although we already observed a bundling effect at 0 . 1 µ M of BIN1 with 1 µ M of actin , as compared to the actin - bundling activity reported for the BIN1 iso1 ( ≥ 0 . 25 µ Μ according to ( Dräger et al . , 2017 ) ) . Furthermore , we detected the similar actin - bundling activity by adding each of the BIN mutants separately ( Fig . 2F ) . Altogether , these data show that mutations at the N - BAR and SH3 domain trun - cation do not perturb the F - actin association and bundling ability of BIN1 . Next , we analyzed the effect of the N - BAR and SH3 domain of BIN1 on filopodia - like structure formation in cellulo ( Fig . 2G - I Fig . S1B ) . Therefore , GFP , GFP - BIN1 iso8 , or GFP - tagged BIN1 D151N and BIN1 Δ SH3 mutants were co - expressed with Lifeact - mCherry to monitor the density and lifetime of actin - rich protrusions . As ex - pected , expression of GFP - BIN1 iso8 in C2C12 cells increased filopodia density compared to control conditions ( GFP alone ) . However , we did not detect a significant increase in their density with the D151N or Δ SH3 BIN1 mutants ( Fig . 2G and H ) . Nevertheless , no significant differences were observed in the filopodia lifetime ( i . e . , the time until filopodia collapse ) between BIN1 wild - type expression ( ∼ 2 - fold in - crease in the filopodia lifetime ) and the two BIN1 mutants ( ∼ 1 . 5 - fold increase ) ( Fig . 2I ) , in agreement with their similar association to and bundling of F - actin ( Fig . 2D - F ) . These data indicate that the N - BAR and SH3 domains are likely to contribute to BIN1 - induced filopodia - like structure formation , possibly favoring the association with BIN1 - binding partners . 8 Figure 2 .

IRSp53 is required for BIN1 - mediated filopodia formation To evaluate the contribution of potential BIN1 partners in the formation of F - actin - rich structures , we performed a proteomic analysis using GFP - BIN1 iso8 to identify its binding partners ( Fig . S2A ) . We found already known BIN1 partners ( in grey Fig . S2A ) : dynamin 1 and 2 ( Lee et al . , 2002 ; Nicot et al . , 2007 ) and actin ( this study and D’Alessandro et al . , 2015 ) , and unknown partners ( in yellow Fig . S2A ) such as IR - Sp53 and ezrin . Interestingly , IRSp53 is involved in the Cdc42 - dependent formation of filopodia ( Scita et al . , 2008 ; Lim et al . , 2008 ; Disanza et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , we confirmed by immunofluorescence that endogenous IRSp53 and BIN iso8 colocalize at actin - rich filopodia - like structures on C2C12 myoblasts ( Fig . 3D ) . Next , we deter - mined the role of IRSp53 in BIN1 - mediated filopodia formation in C2C12 cells ( Fig . 3E - G ) . As expected , IRSp53 knock - down in C2C12 cells led to a decrease in filopo - dia - like structure density . While the expression of GFP - BIN1 iso8 in CTRL siRNA C2C12 promoted an increase in filopodia formation , this was not the case under IR - Sp53 knock - down ( Fig . 3G ) , therefore , suggesting that BIN1 - mediated filopodia - like structure formation requires the inverted - BAR ( I - BAR ) protein IRSp53 . The topology at the neck of filopodia is compatible with the binding of proteins with positive curvature BAR - domain sensors like BIN1 ( Suetsugu et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , we inquire whether BIN1 iso8 can be recruited to negatively - curved membranes in - duced by IRSp53 using an in vitro reconstituted assay and confocal microscopy ( Fig . 10 3E ) , as previously reported ( Inamdar et al . , 2021 ) . We generated 5 % mole PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) doped with Oregon Green 488 DHPE , as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is a central phosphoinositide for BIN1 and IRSp53 membrane interac - tions ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Picas et al . , 2014 ) . As expected , the addition of the full - length IRSp53 led to the formation of inward membrane tubes on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - GUVs . The addition of recombinant alexa fluor A647 - labeled BIN1 iso8 showed that it ac - cumulates to membrane indentations that are generated by IRSp53 ( Fig . 3E ) . To con - firm that the presence of IRSp53 mediates BIN1 localization to the base of inward membrane tubes , we generated dark PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing GUVs and monitored the co - localization of recombinant alexa fluor A488 - labeled IRSp53 and alexa fluor A647 - labeled BIN1 iso8 ( Fig . 3F ) . Our results confirmed that IRSp53 allows BIN1 recruitment at the base of negatively - curved membrane structures . Figure 3 . BIN1 associates with IRSp53 on membrane protrusions .

BIN1 - mediated recruitment of ezrin participates in filopodia formation Interestingly , our proteomic study identified novel BIN1 interactors , such as the members of the ezrin - radixin - moesin ( ERM ) protein family ( Fig . S2A ) , previously found to accumulate at the shaft of filopodia and to co - localize with IRSp53 on mi - crovilli ( Gandy et al . , 2013 ; Garbett et al . , 2013 ) . To study if specificity exists be - tween different BIN isoforms and the two ERM members ezrin and moesin , we per - formed co - immunoprecipitation experiments using several amphiphysin isoforms : amphiphysin1 , BIN1 iso1 and BIN1 iso8 . Our results showed that only BIN1 iso8 as - sociated with ezrin in cellulo ( Fig . 4A ) , while both BIN1 iso1 and iso8 isoforms as - sociate with moesin ( Fig . S2B ) . We also found that only the BIN1 D151N mutant , but not the Δ SH3 mutant , associates with ezrin ( Fig . 4B ) , suggesting that the SH3 - con - taining C - terminal domain of BIN1 mediates the interaction with ezrin . Next , we tested the association of BIN1 and ezrin during filopodia formation . We per - formed multi - color time - lapse live - cell imaging of C2C12 cells co - expressing mCher - ry - ezrin together with either GFP - BIN1 iso8 and the Δ SH3 mutant that , according to our biochemical assay does not associate with ezrin ( Fig . 4C and Fig . S2C ) . Spinning - disk images showed that BIN1 and ezrin co - localize at the cell periphery ( Fig . 4C - D ) . Detailed analysis of the dynamics of ezrin and BIN1 also showed that both proteins co - localized during filopodia formation ( Fig . 4D ) . In addition , co - expression of ezrin with BIN1 potentiated the formation of filopodia compared to BIN1 alone ( Fig . 4E ) , suggesting that BIN1 and ezrin might cooperate in this process . Conversely , an ab - sence of co - localization and of effect on filopodia density was observed between ezrin and the BIN1 Δ SH3 mutant , indicating that BIN1 - ezrin mediated filopodia - like struc - 12 ture formation might require ezrin association to BIN1 via the SH3 domain of BIN1 ( Fig . S2C ) . Ezrin displays different conformational states , including a cytosolic closed - conforma - tion , which results from the intramolecular interaction of the N - terminal FERM do - main with the C - terminal ERM - associated domain ( C - ERMAD ) , a membrane - bound opened - conformation , which requires a sequential activation through the interaction with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , a phosphorylated conformation , which displays a phosphorylation of a conserved threonine in the actin - binding site of the C - ERMAD ( T567 , in ezrin ) and finally , the interaction of the C - ERMAD with F - actin ( Fievet et al . , 2004 ) . Interesting - ly , we previously showed that BIN1 clusters PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to recruit PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - interacting downstream partners on membranes ( Picas et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , we analyzed if PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , a key phosphoinositide for the recruitment of actin regulatory proteins promoting actin polymerization and filopodia formation at the plasma membrane ( Senju et al . , 2017 ; Senju and Lappalainen , 2019 ) could participate in ezrin membrane recruitment by BIN1 . We confirmed that filopodia positive for BIN1 are highly en - riched in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . S2D ) . Next , using an in vitro reconstituted assay consisting of supported lipid bilayers doped with 5 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , we quantified the binding of re - combinant wild - type ezrin and its phospho - mimetic form ( ezrin - T567D ) in the pres - ence of recombinant BIN1 iso8 ( Fig . 4F ) . As a control we used amphiphysin 1 , a pro - tein that does not interact with ezrin , but that mediates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering ( Picas et al . , 2014 ) . We estimated the relative binding of ezrin , wild type or T567D , from the ratio between the intensity of ezrin proteins bound on membranes in the presence of BIN1 iso8 or of amphiphysin1 , normalized by the intensity of ezrin proteins in the absence of BIN1 or amphiphysin1 . We obtained a ~ 2 . 5 - fold and 1 . 5 - fold increase in the relative membrane binding of ezrin and ezrin - T567D , respectively , in the presence of BIN1 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 4F ) . In agreement with the results in Fig . 4A , amphiphys - in1 did not affect ezrin binding to membranes . Altogether these observations suggest that BIN1 - mediated ezrin recruitment on membranes is probably mediated by protein - protein interactions ( Fig . 4B ) on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interfaces . To further understand the molecular mechanisms of BIN1 / ezrin interaction at the cell cortex , we investigated the impact of Bin1 knock - down on ezrin and phosphorylated 13 ezrin ( phospho - ezrin ) expression ( Fig . 4G ) and localization ( Fig . 4H ) . We observed a two - fold increase of phosphorylated ezrin in Bin1 shRNA C2C12 cells , but no modi - fication of the total pool of ezrin ( Fig . 4G ) . In addition , we observed that phospho - ezrin appears enriched at filopodia in control C2C12 cells ( Fig . 4H ) . However , such enrichment was not observed in C2C12 Bin1 shRNA myoblasts . These results indi - cate that although the total level of phospho - ezrin is increased , the cellular organiza - tion of phospho - ezrin appears affected in Bin1 knock - down myoblasts . This suggests that BIN1 might regulate the localization and activation of ezrin at the plasma mem - brane . 14 Figure 4 . BIN1 regulates ezrin localization on membranes .

BIN1 regulates the cell cortex architecture of myoblast In myoblast cells , BIN1 expression increases during differentiation ( Fig . 5A ) ( Lee et al . , 2002 ; Nicot et al . , 2007 ) , and its inhibition is associated with impaired myotube formation ( Wechsler - Reya et al . , 1998 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ) , data that we also conﬁrmed ( Fig . S3 ) . Furthermore , we observed that the expression of different differentiation markers was not affected in Bin1 shRNA C2C12 ( Fig . S3 ) , suggesting a potential role of BIN1 during the fusion stages of myoblast cells . Previous works showed that the SH3 domain of BIN1 mediates the interaction with its downstream partner dynamin ( Kojima et al . , 2004 ; Royer et al . , 2013 ) , a GTPase well known to bundle actin ﬁla - ments and having an important role during ﬁlopodia formation promoting myoblast fusion in vivo ( Gu et al . , 2010 ; Yamada et al . , 2016 ; Chuang et al . , 2019 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , we conﬁrmed by immunoﬂuorescence that endogenous BIN1 co - localizes with GFP - dynamin2 at actin - rich structures on C2C12 cells ( Fig . 5A ) . In contrast , the density and morphology of dynamin2 - positive actin - rich protrusions ap - peared affected in C2C12 Bin1 shRNA myoblasts ( Fig . 5B - C ) . Collectively , suppor - ting that , in addition to their shared role in membrane remodeling , BIN1 and its part - ner dynamin2 can also interact on actin - rich protrusions . Interestingly , ezrin , one of our BIN1 - interacting partners during ﬁlopodia formation , was recently shown to be involved in myoblast differentiation and fusion ( Zhang et al . , 2023 ) . Therefore , to investigate if the association of BIN1 / ezrin on ﬁlopodia is 16 maintained during myoblast differentiation , we analyzed the expression ( Fig . 5D - E ) and co - localization of endogenous BIN1 and the active phosphorylated form of ezrin ( phospho - ezrin ) in proliferating C2C12 cells ( Day 0 ) , i . e . ≤ 80 - 90 % cell conﬂuency in growth medium , and at 1 day of differentiation ( Day 1 ) , i . e . 24h in differentiation medium . We observed that during differentiation BIN1 expression is conveyed with an increase in phospho - ezrin expression ( Fig . 5D - E ) . Furthermore , BIN1 appears co - localized with phospho - ezrin on ﬁlopodia both under proliferating and differentiation conditions ( Fig . 5F ) . Thus , pointing out that the expression and membrane localiza - tion of BIN1 and the active form of ezrin must be finely regulated during myoblasts differentiation . As a central protein linking the actin cytoskeleton to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane , ezrin is an important regulator of the mechanical cohesion of the mem - brane / actin interface ( Diz - Muñoz et al . , 2010 ; Sens and Plastino , 2015 ; Tsai et al . , 2018 ) . We thus assessed the cortex - to - membrane mechanics from the force required to form membrane tethers on myoblasts , as previously described ( Diz - Muñoz et al . , 2010 ) . To this end , we used atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) cantilevers coated with poly - L - lysine to pull membrane tethers from the plasma membrane of control and Bin1 knock - down C2C12 cells ( Fig . 5G ) . We measured the static tether force , f 0 , which is required to hold a membrane tether at a constant height . This force depends on the bending stiffness of the membrane ( κ ) , the in - plane membrane tension ( σ ) , and the energy density of the membrane - to - cortex attachments ( W 0 ) ( Sheetz , 2001 ) : We found that the apparent static tether force is decreased in Bin1 shRNA cells as compared to control conditions ( Fig . 5G ) . In agreement , we also observed , using time - lapse phase - contrast videomicroscopy , the presence of prolonged retraction fibers similar to membrane tethers behind migrating Bin1 knock - down cells ( Fig . 5H ) . Therefore , suggesting that BIN1 regulates , either directly or through its association with ezrin , the stability of the plasma membrane / actin interface . f 0 = 2 π ( 2 ( σ + W 0 ) κ ) 1 / 2 17 Figure 5 .

Discussion We unravel here an unexpected role of BIN1 in promoting filopodia formation in skeletal muscle cells , structures that play a crucial role in myoblast adhesion and fu - sion in mammalian cells and Drosophila ( Segal et al . , 2016 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . The sequence of events that can be envisioned for the BIN1 - mediated formation of filopo - dia at the myoblast cortex is presented in Fig . 6 . Whereas BIN1 was shown to promote positive membrane curvature ( Lee et al . , 2002 ; Picas et al . , 2014 ) , we show here that BIN1 could also regulate the formation of membrane protrusions that have a negatively curved membrane geometry . Indeed , BIN1 expression in skeletal muscle cells promotes filopodia formation , and , recipro - cally , its knock - down decreases their density at the cell surface , including at intercel - lular cell - cell contacts . High - resolution microscopy revealed that BIN1 is present at the base and all along the filopodia . Such an unexpected function was also reported in the case of PACSIN2 / Syndapin II , an F - BAR domain protein shown to be involved in cellular protrusion formation ( Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ) , presumably through the binding to the positively curved membrane at the base and the tip of filopodia ( Shi - mada et al . , 2010 ) . Our proteomic analysis revealed that BIN1 is associated with proteins having impor - tant functions during filopodia formation such as actin , dynamin , IRSp53 , and the ERM proteins . We demonstrated that the generation of these filopodia by BIN1 re - quires IRSp53 , an I - BAR protein that initiates the formation of filopodia ( Lim et al . , 2008 ; Disanza et al . , 2013 ; Prévost et al . , 2015 ) and is implicated in the generation and maintenance of filopodia during the fusion process in Drosophila ( Segal et al . , 2016 ) . IRSp53 acts as a membrane - curvature sensing platform for assembling protein complexes ( Bisi et al . , 2020 ) . Our in vitro data with purified IRSp53 , which is active in this condition in the absence of Cdc42 ( Tsai et al . , 2022 ) , show that IRSp53 allows BIN1 recruitment at the base of negatively - curved membranes . BAR domain proteins are well known to generate stable lipid membrane microdomains ( Zhao et al . , 2013 ; Picas et al . , 2014 ) . BIN1 has a PI domain that targets it to membrane domains , and we previously showed that BIN1 induces the clustering of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . IRSp53 directly 20 binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich membrane and deforms them ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ) , and might also promote the formation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clusters ( Zhao et al . , 2013 ) . We thus could envision a positive feedback loop with both proteins favoring their respective recruit - ment at specific membrane sites , where IRSp53 recruitment , in turn , assists BIN1 lo - calization at the base of filopodial structures . Moreover , these PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clusters might facilitate the recruitment of proteins having PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding motifs , such as actin regulators involved in protrusion formation ( Senju et al . , 2017 ; Senju and Lappalai - nen , 2019 ) . The recruitment of actin regulators could also be directly mediated by BIN1 and IRSp53 - dependent protein - protein interactions . Among the BIN1 partners known to regulate actin remodeling are WASP and dynamin ( Yamada et al . , 2009 ; Chuang et al . , 2019 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . Moreover , the SH3 domain of IRSp53 allows it to interact with VASP ( Disanza et al . , 2013 ) , N - WASP ( Lim et al . , 2008 ) , WAVE and mDia ( Goh et al . , 2012 ) or also EPS8 , an actin - filament bundling and capping protein ( Disanza et al . , 2006 ; Hertzog et al . , 2010 ) . Actin filament - bundling and membrane interactions are both essential features for the shape maintenance of filopodium ( Mattila and Lappalainen , 2008 ; Svitkina , 2018 ) . BIN1 could participate in F - actin bundling at least via two mechanisms . We discove - red through in vitro assays a direct role of BIN1 in F - actin bundling , that combined with its direct association with actin , explains why BIN1 is closely connected with F - actin along filopodia . Moreover , the interaction of BIN1 with its downstream partner dynamin ( Kojima et al . , 2004 ; Royer et al . , 2013 ) is likely to enhance the formation of actin - rich protrusions via its multifilament actin - bundling ability required for efficient myoblast fusion ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . Furthermore , our proteomic analysis of the BIN1 partners confirmed its association with dynamin and actin and , importantly , identified the ERM family proteins . BIN1 is the only amphiphysin member tested to associate with ezrin , to our knowledge . We focused on the BIN1 / ezrin interaction and function because ezrin is a membrane - actin linker that anchors F - actin to the plasma membrane at different types of membranes protrusions ( Fehon et al . , 2010 ) , and ap - pears enriched in filopodia ( Osawa et al . , 2009 ) . We showed that BIN1 and the phos - phorylated active version of ezrin are co - localized in filopodia , and in the absence of BIN1 , phosphorylated ezrin is no more enriched in filopodia . BIN1 could participate 21 in ezrin recruitment through several non - exclusive mechanisms . First , BIN1 SH3 do - main is crucial for its association with ezrin , suggesting direct protein - protein interac - tion . Secondly , ezrin binding could also be mediated by the IRSp53 protein which was shown to enrich ezrin on negatively curved membranes ( Tsai et al . , 2018 ) . Local de - pletion of ezrin from the plasma membrane is required to initiate actin - driven protru - sion formation ( Welf et al . , 2020 ) . Our study shows that BIN1 - mediated filopodia formation is likely to occur once the protrusion is initiated , as it requires IRSp53 for its localization at negatively - curved membrane indentations . Thus , BIN1 / ezrin asso - ciation might enhance the membrane / actin interaction at later stages of filopodia for - mation . This is in agreement with the described role of ezrin as a major regulator lin - king the plasma membrane to the cortical actin while allowing the rapid remodeling of both structures ( Diz - Muñoz et al . , 2010 ; Rouven Brückner et al . , 2015 ; Korkmaz - han and Dunn , 2022 ) . The membrane - to - cortex architecture is tightly tuned in dynamic processes such as membrane protrusion formation during cell migration or membrane fusion in myo - blasts ( Diz - Muñoz et al . , 2010 ; Kim et al . , 2015 ; Sens and Plastino , 2015 ; Chakrabor - ty et al . , 2022 ) . Using AFM , we identified that BIN1 regulates the apparent static te - ther force . The absence of BIN1 would contribute to a disorganization of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / ezrin interface at the plasma membrane and consequently , to a loose membrane - to - cortex attachment and a decrease in the formation of filopodia . Indeed , the long mem - brane tails in migrating cells that we observed upon BIN1 knock - down would reflect a loosening of membrane - cortex attachments . Furthermore , all the BIN1 - mediated processes here identified ( F - actin bundling ) and partners ( IRSp53 , dynamin ) are me - chanisms previously identified to participate in the formation of membrane protrusion required for myoblast fusion in mammals and insects ( Vasyutina et al . , 2009 ; Bach et al . , 2010 ; Sens et al . , 2010 ; Shilagardi et al . , 2013 ; Bothe et al . , 2014 ; Segal et al . , 2016 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . Accordingly , we confirmed that BIN1 is required for myo - blast fusion in C2C12 myoblasts , as previously reported in cellulo ( Wechsler - Reya et al . , 1998 ) and in vivo ( Lee et al . , 2002 ; Fernando et al . , 2009 ; Prokic et al . , 2020 ) . BIN1 isoform 8 appears dispensable for muscle development but is required for muscle regene - ration in adulthood ( Prokic et al . , 2020 ) and t he D151N or the Δ SH3 BIN1 mutants are 22 associated with the autosomal recessive form of centronuclear myopathies ( Nicot et al . , 2007 ; Royer et al . , 2013 ) . In conclusion , we discovered a novel and unexpected role for BIN1 in the formation of filopodia , adding complexity in the diversity of the molecular mechanisms leading to filopodia formation ( Dobramysl et al . , 2021 ) . Our study suggests a dual function of BIN1 both as a scaffold to recruit proteins , including ezrin , at the cell cortex and as an actin - bundling protein . We found a tandem role of IRSp53 and BIN1 , in filopodia formation . The association of IRSp53 with antagonistic BAR domain proteins was reported to participate in filopodia formation ( Galic et al . , 2014 ; Dobramysl et al . , 2021 ) or to assist endocytosis ( Veltman et al . , 2011 ; Bisi et al . , 2020 ) in different cell types and organisms . Why proteins with opposite curvature domains are required to enable distinct remodeling events at the plasma membrane is yet an open question but suggests that the spatio - temporal regulation of these events is a complex molecular process . Figure 6 . Model of BIN1 - mediated filopodia formation at the myoblast membrane . The following steps are shown : 1 ) formation of BIN1 - mediated filopodia - like structures requires an IRSp53 - based actin complex leading to the initial evagination of the plasma membrane ( Prévost et al . , 2015 ) . 2 ) Binding of BIN1 at the plasma mem - brane might led to the formation of a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich interface ( Picas et al . , 2014 ) . This PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 enrichment might , in turn , facilitate the accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - interacting proteins involved in the formation of actin - rich protru - sions such as IRSp53 , ezrin , and dynamin at the cell cortex . 3 ) The actin bundling ability of BIN1 and its associa - tion with phospho - ezrin , IRSp53 and dynamin ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ) facilitates its localization during filopodia for - mation . The different molecular players involved in this process are : IRSp53 in dark gray , BIN1 in magenta , dy - namin in orange , ezrin and phospho - ezrin in green , actin in yellow , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in red . 23 24 Methods Reagents Natural and synthetic phospholipids , including POPS , POPC , POPE , brain total lipid extract , brain L - α - phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate , and TopFluor - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are from Avanti Polar Lipids .

C2C12 mouse myoblasts ( ATCC CRL - 1772 ) were grown in DMEM / Ham ' s F - 12 ( 1 : 1 ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . To induce differentia - tion , the growth medium was replaced with differentiation medium consisting of DMEM / Ham ' s F - 12 supplemented with 2 % fetal calf serum ( Hyclone / Perbio Sci - ences , Brebieres , France ) . All cells were tested mycoplasma free . Co - immunoprecipitation , western blot experiments and proteomic assays To test the interaction between Amphiphysin isoforms and endogenous actin or ERM proteins , HeLa cells ( CCL2 from ATCC ) were seeded on 50 cm petri dishes over - night . Cells were then transfected for 24 h with either GFP , full - length GFP - BIN1 iso - form 8 , GFP - BIN1 isoform 1 and GFP - Amphiphysin1 using x - tremGENE9 ( Roche ) . Cells were then trypsinized , washed once in PBS , and incubated on ice for 60 min in a lysis buffer : 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 50 – 100 or 200 mM NaCl , and 0 . 1 % NP40 . Cells were then centrifuged 10 min at 10 , 000 × g to collect the supernatant . Extracts were processed for co - immunoprecipitation using GFPTrap beads ( Chromotek ) ( 20 µ l GFP - Trap beads per condition ) for 3h at 4°C in lysis buffer . Beads were washed four times in lysis buffer and then processed for western - blotting . To test the interaction of BIN1 and its mutated variants , C2C12 myoblasts were seed - ed overnight and transfected for 24h with either GFP , full - length GFP - BIN1 isoform 8 WT , Δ SH3 and D151N mutants using JetPEI ( Ozyme ) . Co - immunoprecipitation assay was performed as detailed above . For western - blot experiments cell lysis was performed in 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % NP40 , and a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma ) . The following primary antibodies were used : rabbit anti - ezrin ( from M . Arpin laboratory ( Algrain et al . , 1993 ) ; 1 : 1000 ) , mouse anti - actin ( Sigma ; 1 : 1000 ) , mouse anti - BIN1 ( clone C99D 27 from Millipore ; 1 : 1000 ) , phosphor - ezrin . Secondary Horseradish Peroxidase ( HRP ) - coupled antibodies were from Jackson Laboratories . For proteomic analysis , HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either GFP or GFP - BIN1 using X - tremeGENE 9 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . HeLa cells , with high transfection efficiency , were used because we pre - viously developed and set up proteomic analysis using this cell line and to ensure that cell type specificities would not bias the obtained BIN1 interactors . Cell lysis and co - immunoprecipitation using GFP - Trap ( Chromotek ) was performed as described above . Mass spectrometry analysis was performed at the Proteomic platform of Insti - tut Jacques Monod ( Paris , France ) . Positive hits binding to GFP - Bin1 were selected relatively to their corresponding Mascot score . Short interfering RNA ( shRNA ) shRNA constructs were engineered on a pSIREN retroviral vector ( Clontech ) . To de - plete the endogenous expression of BIN1 , the oligonucleotide 5’ - GATCCG CCT - G A T A T C A A G T C G C G C A T T T T C A A G A G A A A T G C G C - GACTTGATATCAGG CTTTTTTACGCGTG - 3’ was inserted into pSIREN . Bold letters correspond to exons 5 / 6’s junction of mouse Bin1 . As a control , we used the oligonucleotide 5’ - GTTGCGCCCGCGAATGATATATAATGttcaagagaCAT - TATATATCATTCGCGGGCGCAAC - 3’ sequence against luciferase . HEK293T cells expressing shRNA Bin1 or shRNA luciferase ( CTRL ) were cultured , and cell - free supernatants containing retrovirus were harvested . Two sequential trans - ductions of C2C12 myoblasts were performed , as previously described ( Meriane et al . , 2000 ) , by adding 2 mL of filtered supernatant ( 0 . 45 mm PES sterile syringe filter ) within a time window of 6h between transductions . Double transduced cells were kept for 72h in culture . After this time , cells were kept under puromycin at 1 µ g / ml for 72h before performing the experiments . For each cycle of double transient transduction , shRNA efficiency was determined by western blotting showing to ensure a complete depletion of the BIN1 protein . Under these experimental conditions , we did not ob - 28 serve significant cellular mortality due to puromycin selection , suggesting that the entire population of cells should be infected by the shRNA . To ensure that defects in cell proliferation and motility in the shRNA Bin1 cell line , shRNA BIN1 C2C12 were seeded at higher density ( i . e . , at the onset of differentia - tion ) . RNA interference ( siRNA ) The siRNA used in this study to IRSp53 was ON - TARGET plus siIRSp53 ( BAIAP2 ) mouse ( Horizon Discovery , Cat # J - 046696 - 11 ) ( Rodríguez - Pérez et al . , 2021 ) . The siRNA sequence targeting luciferase ( CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA ) was used as a control and was obtained from Sigma . siRNA delivery was performed using Lipo - fectamine RNAiMAX , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Time - lapse fluorescence microscopy C2C12 cells were seeded on FluoroDish ( WPI , France ) cell culture dishes overnight . Cells were then transfected for 12 h with either GFP - BIN1 , D151N or Δ SH3 mutants and Lifeact - mCherry ; GFP or GFP - BIN1 and its mutated variants and mCherry - ezrin using JetPEI ( Ozyme ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Live - cell imaging was performed on a Spinning disk microscope based on a CSU - X1 Yokogawa head mounted on an inverted Ti - E Nikon microscope equipped with a motorized XY Stage . Images were acquired through a 60x objective NA 1 . 4 Plan - Apo objective with a Pho - tometrics Coolsnap HQ2 CCD camera . Optical sectioning was performed using a piezo stage ( Mad City Lab ) . A dual Roper / Errol laser lounge equipped with 491 and 561 nm laser diodes ( 50 mW each ) and coupled to the spinning disk head through a single fiber was used . Multi - dimensional acquisitions were performed in streaming mode using Metamorph 7 software . Images were collected every second ( 500 msec exposure ) during 60s . Immunofluorescence microscopy Fixed cells were obtained after incubation with 3 . 2 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 10 min at room temperature , washed with PBS , incubated with PBS - 0 . 1 M NH 4 Cl for 5 29 min and then washed with PBS . Finally , cells were permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 3 min and blocked with 1 % BSA during 10 min . Fixed cells were mounted using mowiol mounting agent and visualized using a Leica DMRA and a CoolSnap - HQ2 camera , 100x objective NA 1 . 25 oil Ph 3 CS ( HCX PL APO ) and analyzed with the Metamorph software . 3D stacks were acquired and deconvolved to build a projec - tion on one plane using Image J . For myotube imaging , images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM880 Airyscan confocal microscope ( MRI facility , Montpellier ) . Excitations sources used were : 405 nm diode laser , an Argon laser for 488 nm and 514 nm and a Helium / Neon laser for 633 nm . Acquisitions were performed on a 63x / 1 . 4 objective . Multidimensional acquisitions were performed via an Airyscan detector ( 32 - channel GaAsP photomultiplier tube ( PMT ) array detector ) . Images are presented as a z - projection of all planes . Tether pulling experiments Tether pulling experiments were performed on a JPK Nanowizard III mounted on an inverted Zeiss wide - field microscope . Olympus Biolevers ( k = 6 mN · m - 1 ) were cleaned in acetone for 5 minutes and then plasma - cleaned for 10 min . Then , can - tilevers were soaked briefly in 0 . 1 M of NaHCO 3 ( pH 9 . 0 ) , air dried and immersed in 0 . 01 % poly - L - lysin overnight at 4ºC in a humid chamber . Before the measurements , cantilevers were rinsed three times in PBS and mounted on the AFM cantilever hold - er . The cantilever spring constant was determined by the thermal noise method , as de - tailed in ( Schillers et al . , 2017 ) . For the measurement , cells seeded for 24h on Fluo - roDish cell culture dishes were kept on DMEM - F12 medium at 37ºC and not used longer than 1 h for data acquisition . Static tether force measurements were performed by retracting the cantilever for 6 µ m at a speed of 10 µ m · s - 1 , and the position was kept constant for 30 s . Resulting force – time curves were analyzed using the JPK analysis software . Tether force values represent the average value obtained from teth - er pulling maps performed over the whole apical membrane of adherent C2C12 cells after applying 3 x 3 grids of 10 µ m 2 . Protein purification and fluorescent labelling 30 Recombinant human full - length BIN1 isoform 8 , Amphiphysin 1 , ezrin wild - type and ezrin T567D were expressed in Rosetta 2 bacteria and purified by affinity chromatog - raphy using glutathione Sepharose 4B beads as previously published ( Picas et al . , 2014 ; Tsai et al . , 2018 ) . Recombinant proteins were labelled by conjugation with ei - ther Alexa Fluor 488 or 647 following maleimide chemistry ( Invitrogen ) , as in ( Picas et al . , 2014 ; Tsai et al . , 2018 ) . Recombinant human full - length IRSp53 ( Uniprot # Q9UQB8 ) was purified and la - beled with Alexa Fluor 488 as previously described ( Tsai et al . , 2022 ) . Muscle actin was purified from rabbit muscle and isolated in monomeric form in G - buffer ( 5 mM Tris - Cl - , pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 01 % NaN3 ) as previously described ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) . Lipid bilayer experiments Supported lipid bilayers were prepared as described in ( Braunger et al . , 2013 ) . The lipid mixture consisted of : 60 % POPC , 20 % POPE , 10 - 15 % POPS and 5 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The amount of total negatively charged lipids was kept to 20 % for any of the mixtures containing PIs at the expenses of brain - phosphatidylserine . Fluorescent TopFluor - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was added to 0 . 1 % . Experiments were performed by injecting 15 µ L of buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl and 0 . 5 mg · ml - 1 of casein ) . Supported lipid bilayers were imaged on a Zeiss LSM880 Airyscan confocal microscope ( MRI facility , Montpellier ) . Excitations sources used were : Argon laser for 488 nm and 514 nm and a Helium / Neon laser for 633 nm . Acquisitions were performed on a 63x / 1 . 4 objective . GUV preparation and observation The lipid mixture used contain total brain extract supplemented with 5 mol % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at 0 . 5 mg / mL in chloroform . If needed , the lipid mixture is further supple - mented with 0 . 5 mol % BODIPY TR ceramide or 0 . 5 mol % OG - DHPE . GUVs were prepared by the polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA ) gel - assisted formation method as previously described ( Weinberger et al . , 2013 ) . Briefly , a PVA gel solution ( 5 % , w / w , dissolved in 280 mM sucrose and 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 ) warmed up to 50 °C was spread on clean coverslips ( 20mm × 20mm ) . The coverslips were cleaned by ethanol 31 and then ddH 2 O twice . The PVA - coated coverslips were incubated at 50 °C for 30 min . Then , around 5 µ l of the lipid mixture was spread on the PVA - coated coverslips , followed by placing them under vacuum at room temperature for 30 min . The covers - lips were then placed in a petri dish and around 500 µ l of the inner buffer was pipetted on the top of the coverslips . The inner buffer contains 50 mM NaCl , 20 mM sucrose and 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 . The coverslips were kept at room temperature for at least 45 min , allowing GUVs to grow . Once done , we gently “ticked” the bottom of the petri dish to detach GUVs from the PVA gel . The GUVs were collected using a 1 ml pipette tip with its tip cut to prevent breaking the GUVs . For all experiments , coverslips were passivated with a β - casein solution at a concen - tration of 5 g . L - 1 for at least 5 min at room temperature . Experimental chambers were assembled by placing a silicon open chamber on a coverslip . GUVs were first incubated with IRSp53 in the outer buffer ( 60 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 ) for at least 15 min at room temperature before adding BIN1 into the GUV - IRSp53 mixture . The final GUV - protein mixture was then incubated at least 15 min at room temperature before observation . Samples were observed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope equipped with Yokogawa CSU - X1 spinning disk confocal head , 100X CFI Plan Apo VC objective ( Nikon ) and a sCMOS camera Prime 95B ( Photometrics ) . F - actin bundling assay Actin ( 1 µ M , non - labeled ) was polymerized 1 hour in a buffer containing 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 10 mM DTT , 1 mM DABCO , 5 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 and 0 . 01 % NaN3 in the presence of BIN1 at different concentrations . Then , 5 µ l of the protein mixtures was diluted 20 times ( i . e . , 50 nM of filamentous actin in the presence of BIN1 ) in the same buffer supplemented with 0 . 3 % methylcel - lulose and 660 nM of Alexa Fluor 546 - phalloidin . Samples were observed using TIRF microscopy ( Eclipse Ti inverted microscope , 100x TIRF objectives , Quantem 512SC camera ) . 32 Image processing and analysis Protein binding was quantified by measuring the mean grey value of still confocal im - ages of either AlexaFluor 488 ezrin , WT or T567D , in the absence of BIN1 or Am - phiphysin 1 . The obtained average intensity was then used to estimate the fold in - crease in the binding of ezrin , WT or T567D , in the presence of 0 . 1 µ M of BIN1 or Amphiphysin 1 tagged with AlexaFluor 647 . Each data set was performed using the same supported lipid bilayer preparation and confocal parameters were kept constant between experiments and samples . Mean gray values were measured once the steady - state of protein binding was reached , which was estimated to be ≥ 600 s . Mean gray values were measured using Image J ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . To obtain actin fluorescence intensities on a filament or bundles , we manually defined a ROI , a 6 pixel - width line perpendicularly to the filament or bundle . We then ob - tained the intensity profile of the line in which the x - axis of the profile is the length of the line and the y - axis is the averaged pixel intensity along the width of the line . The actin intensity was the maximum intensity value in the intensity profile . Filopodia density , morphology and dynamics were analyzed by a custom written pro - gram allowing the semi - automatic tracking the Life - actin signal of time - lapse movies using Image J . Statistical analyses Results are shown as a mean ± standard deviation ( s . d . ) . Unless stated otherwise , av - erage values represent at least three technical replicates in the case of in vitro experi - ments and biological replicates in the case of cellular studies . Statistical significance was assessed by Welch’s t test , unless stated otherwise . References Abmayr , S . M . , and G . K . Pavlath . 2012 . Myoblast fusion : lessons from flies and mice .
