Gly146 is situated at the hinge between the two domains , and we previously showed that a G146V mutation leads to severe motility defects in skeletal myosin but has no effect on motility of myosin V . The present study tested the hypothesis that G146V mutation impaired rotation between the two domains , leading to such functional defects . First , our study showed that depolymer - ization of G146V filaments was slower than that of wild - type filaments . This result is consis - tent with the distinction of structural states of G146V filaments from those of the wild type , considering the recent report that stabilization of actin filaments involves rotation of the two domains . Next , we measured intramolecular FRET efficiencies between two fluorophores in the two domains with or without skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin or the heavy meromyo - sin equivalent of myosin V in the presence of ATP . Single - molecule FRET measurements showed that the conformations of actin subunits of control and G146V actin filaments were different in the presence of skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin . This altered conformation of G146V subunits may lead to motility defects in myosin II . In contrast , distributions of FRET efficiencies of control and G146V subunits were similar in the presence of myosin V , consistent with the lack of motility defects in G146V actin with myosin V . The distribution of FRET efficiencies in the presence of myosin V was different from that in the presence of skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin , implying that the roles of actin conformation in myosin motility depend on the type of myosin .

Introduction The actin molecule consists of two major domains ( the small and large domains ) separated by a deep cleft that binds ATP or ADP . The cleft has been demonstrated to open or close depend - ing on the nucleotide state [ 1 – 3 ] . This conformational change regulates the binding of certain actin - binding proteins . For example , profilin has lower affinity for the ADP — actin monomer than for the ATP — actin monomer [ 4 , 5 ] and binds astride the small and large domains . Thus , profilin may distinguish conformational differences between these two major domains ac - cording to the nucleotide state . The relative positions of the two major domains of the monomeric form and of the subunits within filaments are also different . Accompanying poly - merization , the two major domains rotate in a propeller - like manner , with the actin subunits adopting a flatter conformation . Oda et al . ( 2009 ) suggested that this flat conformation con - tributes to the stability of filaments [ 6 ] . Nonetheless , actin subunits in filaments do not always take one state [ 7 – 10 ] . The conformational variation of actin subunits within a filament may play an important role in the regulation of interactions with various actin - binding proteins in the cells . Propeller rotation within the actin subunit to the flat structure occurs with a certain lag after incorporation into filaments [ 8 ] . Before the rotation , the two domains in the actin subunits are tilted relative to each other , and the actin subunits in the twisted conformation dissociate from the filaments more readily than does the flat form ( discussed in a review [ 11 ] ) . Interestingly , among the possible conformational states of actin subunits in filaments [ 12 ] , one state is stabi - lized by cofilin . The state stabilized by cofilin has two twisted major domains , disrupting con - tacts with neighboring subunits within a filament [ 13 ] . This characteristic of cofilin may contribute to its function in severing actin filaments . Conformational changes in actin fila - ments may also be involved in myosin motility , since modifications of actin filaments by pro - teolytic cleavage or chemical cross - linking impairs the motility of myosin without significantly affecting the binding affinity and the ability to stimulate myosin ATPase activity [ 14 – 16 ] . These results indicate that the flexibility of or conformational changes in actin filaments are important for force generation by myosin . However , conformational states of actin subunits in - duced by or appropriate for interaction with myosin are not well understood . Transitions between different conformational states of actin subunits in a filament have been hypothesized to occur cooperatively . For example , depolymerization of a single actin fila - ment proceeds at one rate during release of a few thousand actin subunits and then switches to a different rate [ 17 ] . Furthermore , cofilin binds cooperatively to actin filaments [ 12 , 18 – 20 ] , involving cooperative conformational changes in the filaments ( described in a review [ 21 ] ) . Cofilin - induced cooperative conformational changes in actin subunits accompany significant supertwisting of the helical pitch , which propagates to neighboring subunits [ 22 ] . Myosin also induces cooperative conformational changes in actin filaments [ 10 , 23 – 25 ] and binds coopera - tively to actin filaments [ 26 , 27 ] . Thus , myosin - induced cooperative conformational changes in actin filaments may also involve propeller rotation between the two major domains . The absolutely conserved Gly146 ( in the Dictyostelium Act15 sequence without the removed first Met ) of actin sits at the hinge between the two domains . We previously reported that the G146V mutation of actin dominantly inhibits the growth of yeast cells [ 28 ] and impairs the in vitro gliding motility by skeletal myosin II but not of myosin V [ 29 ] . We speculated that the G146V mutation somehow affects the propeller rotation between the two major domains , which in turn impairs the motility of myosin II but not that of myosin V . In the present study , we performed filament depolymerization assays and single - molecule intramolecular FRET measurements to test this hypothesis . We used a newly developed FRET - probed actin with donor and acceptor fluorophores attached to the tips of the two domains .

Materials and Methods Protein preparation Skeletal heavy meromyosin ( sk MII HMM ) and the heavy meromyosin equivalent of cyto - plasmic myosin V ( MV HMM ) were prepared as described previously [ 30 , 31 ] . Mutant Dictyos - telium act15 genes for FRET analysis , T41Q / S239C / C374A and T41Q / G146V / S239C / C374A , were generated by PCR - based methods . Wild - type ( WT ) and mutant actins were purified as described previously [ 32 ] . G146V and WT actins for the depolymerization assays were labeled with N - ( 1 - pyrene ) iodoacetamide ( Invitrogen , Tokyo , Japan ) , as described previously [ 33 ] . Biotin - labeled actin was prepared as follows . Solutions of polymerized WT or G146V actin dissolved in 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM KCl , and fivefold molar excess of biotin — PEAC5 – maleimide ( Dojin , Kumamoto , Japan ) were mixed and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature . The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 mM DTT . Labeled F - actin was ultracentrifuged at 300 , 000×g for 15 min at room temperature , and the resultant pellet was dis - solved and dialyzed against G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) . The supernatant after ultracentrifugation was used as biotin - labeled actin . Polymerization and depolymerization assays Before polymerization , actin ( 20 % , pyrene - labeled ) in G - buffer was supplemented with 1 mM EGTA and 50 μ M MgCl 2 to convert Ca — actin to Mg — actin and then incubated on ice for 10 min [ 34 ] . Polymerization was induced by adding 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 5 mM ATP . After polymerization for 12 min or overnight at 22°C , 30 μ M latrunculin A ( Sigma , Tokyo , Japan ) was added to induce depolymerization . Rates of polymerization and depolymer - ization were monitored by measuring the fluorescence intensity of pyrene . The critical concentrations of WT and G146V actins were measured by sedimentation as - says . Different concentrations of actin ( 0 . 5 μ M ~ 3 . 0 μ M ) were polymerized in F - buffer ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) for 3 hr at 21°C , and were ultracentrifuged . Amounts of protein in pellets were determined by Advanced Protein Assay Reagent ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) . Labeling of actin with FRET probes Purified T41Q / S239C / C374A and T41Q / G146V / S239C / C374A mutant actins were dialyzed against LG - buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 4 mM ATP , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ) and then diluted to 30 μ M with the same buffer . One - twentieth volume of 30 mM Alexa Fluor 647 C2 maleimide ( Invitrogen ) dissolved in DMSO was added to these actin solutions , and the mix - tures were incubated on ice overnight . The reaction was stopped by adding 3 mM DTT . Actins labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 were further labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 cadaverine ( Invitrogen ) via a transglutaminase reaction using a modification of a reported method [ 35 ] . In brief , Alexa Fluor 647 labeled actin , 150 μ M Alexa Fluor 555 cadaverine and 0 . 3 unit / ml transglutaminase ( Sigma ) were combined , and the resulting mixture was incubated overnight at 4°C . The labeled actins were polymerized by adding 1 / 10 vol of 10×F - buffer ( 100 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 1 M KCl ) . After incubation for 1 hr at room temperature , they were ultracentrifuged at 300 , 000×g for 15 min . The resultant pellets were dissolved and dialyzed against G - buffer and then re - ultracentrifuged . The doubly labeled mutant actins were rapidly frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen . The concentration of doubly labeled actin was measured from its band density in SDS - PAGE using skeletal actin of known concentration as standard . Concentrations of Alexa Fluor 555 and Alexa Fluor 647 were measured by using the extinction coefficients of each fluorescent dye ( Alexa Fluor 555 : 150 , 000 M - 1 cm - 1 at 555 nm ; Alexa Fluor 647 : 239 , 000 Structural Dynamics of Actin PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0126262 May 6 , 2015 3 / 13 M - 1 cm - 1 at 650 nm ) ( Invitrogen ) . The Förster distance of this FRET pair is 5 . 1 nm ( Invitrogen , http : / / www . lifetechnologies . com / jp / ja / home / references / molecular - probes - the - handbook / tables / r0 - values - for - some - alexa - fluor - dyes . html ) . FRET measurement system Control or G146V FRET actin was copolymerized with the corresponding unlabeled and biotin - labeled WT or G146V actins at a molar ratio of 10 : 100 : 1 in buffer at room temperature for 1 hr . The buffer contained 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 8 ) , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM ATP , and 1 . 2 - fold molar excess of phalloidin ( Sigma ) . Phalloidin has no effect on the motility defect of sk MII HMM with G146V mutation [ 29 ] . Two coverslips of different sizes and double - sided adhesive tape were used to construct a flow cell . To immobilize the FRET actin filaments , 2 mg / ml BSA containing 0 . 2 mg / ml biotiny - lated BSA ( Sigma ) was introduced into the flow cell , which was then incubated for 2 min . Un - bound BSA was washed away with FRET buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 8 , 1 mM EGTA , 25 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 ) . Subsequently , 1 mg / ml streptavidin was added , and the cell was incubated for 4 min . After extensive washing with FRET buffer , FRET actin filaments were introduced into the flow cell , which was then incubated for 5 min and then washed with FRET buffer . Fi - nally , M - buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 8 , 1 mM EGTA , 25 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM DTT , 1 mM ATP , oxygen scavenger system [ 36 ] , and ATP regeneration system [ 37 ] ) containing either 2 . 5 μ M sk MII HMM or 30 nM MV HMM and 0 . 2 mg / ml calmodulin was introduced . FRET was monitored by using a custom - made total internal reflection fluorescence micro - scope [ 37 ] equipped with a 100 X objective lens . The donor was excited by a diode laser at 532 nm . Fluorescence of the donor and acceptor was accumulated for 0 . 1 s and stored successively by using an electron multiplying CCD camera ( Ixon , Andor Technologies , Belfast , UK ) . Data analysis Fluorescence spots , which had fluorophores bleached in one step , were used in the calculation of FRET efficiency ( E ) . Light intensities after both fluorophores were bleached ( background ) were subtracted from the fluorescence intensities of donor and acceptor , and the FRET efficien - cy was calculated by using the expression I a / ( I d (cid:129) γ + I a ) . The γ - value , which is a correction factor for fluorescence , accounts for the ratio of donor and acceptor quantum yields and detection ef - ficiencies . We adopted the γ - value from our previous report [ 37 ] , which used the same fluores - cent dyes and FRET measurement system . Individual data series of FRET efficiency were then smoothed by using a moving average of five frames . Fluorescence spots , of which one - third of smoothed FRET efficiencies were over 1 . 0 , were excluded from further analysis . The resultant data series of FRET efficiencies from multiple fluorescence spots were combined to construct a distribution histogram . Each FRET efficiency distribution was then fitted with Gaussian mod - els through the Mclust package in the R software ( R Development Core Team , 2005 , website : www . r - project . org ) . Optimal fits were selected through the Bayesian information criterion ( BIC ) that determines the best parameterization of the model and the optimal number of clusters based on the likelihood of the data [ 38 ] . In a separate analysis , we calculated the means of the FRET efficiencies to compare overall FRET efficiencies under different experimental conditions .

Thus , Dictyostelium actin filaments polymerized for 12 min or overnight were depolymerized by adding excess latrunculin A ( Fig 1 ) . The depolymerization rate of G146V filaments was significantly slower than that of WT filaments , regardless of the Fig 1 . Polymerization and depolymerization of G146V and WT filaments . A 2 μ M solution of monomeric actin ( 20 % labeled with pyrene ) was polymerized for 12 min ( A ) or overnight ( B ) at 22°C . Depolymerization was then induced by adding 30 μ M latrunculin A . Data were fitted with a double - exponential equation , I ( t ) = f sexp ( - t / τ s ) + ( 1 − f s ) exp ( - t / τ f ) [ 17 ] . The parameters f s and τ s respectively give the fraction and depolymerization rate of the slow - depolymerization population , and τ f gives the depolymerization rate of the fast - depolymerization population .

Depolymerization rates of both WT and G146V filaments polymerized for 12 min were higher than those for overnight incubation . As depolymerization process consists of two components [ 17 ] , we fitted each set of depolymerization data with a double - exponential equation ( Table 1 ) . Overall , the lower depolymerization rate of the G146V filaments was due to a larger fraction of slowly depolymerizing component . After aging , the slow component of WT filaments increased about twofold , while that of the G146V filaments increased about fourfold . On the other hand , depolymerization rates of the slow component of WT and G146V filaments did not differ significantly . These results suggest that the G146V subunits favor the conformational state similar to the slowly depolymerizing state of the WT filaments . Thus , G146V mutation may stabilize one of the native states of actin subunits . A global conformational change in the actin molecule involving rotation between the small and large domains has been implicated in stabilization of filaments [ 6 ] . In the flat conformation , the hydrogen side - chain of Gly146 is oriented inward [ 39 ] . The environment around this hy - drogen is hydrophobic , surrounded by side - chains of 142Leu , 152Val , 298Val and 330Ile . Modeling suggested that the introduced Val residue at the 146 th position fits in this space with - out steric clash and interacts with these hydrophobic residues ( S1 Fig ) . In contrast , in the tilted state , the hydrogen side - chain of Gly146 is oriented outward , so that the side - chain of Val resi - due at the 146 th position would be exposed to the surrounding water in this conformation . Thus it is plausible that the flat conformation of G146V actin is more stable than the tilted con - formation , due to the hydrophobic interaction , resulting abundance of the slowly depolymeriz - ing fraction in G146V filaments . The lower critical concentration of G146V actin ( Fig 1D , WT actin vs G146V actin = 1 . 1 μ M vs 0 . 51 μ M ) also suggests that G146V actin is predisposed to take the flat conformation . It should be noted , however , that the hydrogen side - chain of Gly 146 is pointing outward in other structures of actin in the flat conformation [ 6 , 40 ] . The polymerization rate of G146V actin during the initial 12 min incubation was higher than that of WT actin ( Fig 1C ) . This is consistent with the rapid change in G146V subunits to the flat conformation immediately upon their incorporation into filaments , which stabilizes the fila - ment structure . Alternatively , monomeric G146V actin may tend to take a conformation that is incorporated into the filaments more readily than the WT monomers . This latter possibility is consistent with the result of our previous study , which showed that monomeric actin under po - lymerization conditions shift the conformational equilibrium to a polymerization - competent in - termediate state [ 37 ] . Importance of structural dynamics of actin to myosin motility Cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) studies and ensemble biophysical measurements demon - strated that binding of certain actin - binding proteins changes the structure of actin subunits , Table 1 .

However , analysis of the dynamics of actin structure has been difficult because cryo - EM obser - vation requires freezing of actin filaments , and ensemble measurements average out heteroge - neous structural states . Thus , we used single - molecule intramolecular FRET measurement to observe the dynamic behavior of actin structures during myosin motility . By resolving the distribution of FRET efficiencies of individual actin molecules to multiple Gaussian distributions , Kozuka et al . [ 9 ] and Morimatsu et al . [ 37 ] revealed that actin mole - cules take two or more different structural states . These studies demonstrated the unique use - fulness of this approach in the detection of the structural dynamics of actin subunits . However , these studies introduced both acceptor and donor fluorophores into the small domain . This ap - proach is inappropriate for detecting propeller rotation between the small and large domains that the G146V mutation is expected to affect . Thus , we selected the 41st and the 239th residues of actin for fluorescent labeling , because these residues are located near the tips of the small and large domains , respectively ( Fig 2A ) , and because the side - chains of these two residues are oriented outward in the monomeric form [ 41 ] and are therefore accessible from the solvent . Furthermore , labeling of Gln41 in skeletal actin with dansyl cadaverine does not affect interac - tion with myosin II [ 35 ] , and Ser239 is not located in the binding site for myosin [ 42 ] . On the basis of this design , WT and G146V Dictyostelium actin molecules were engineered to carry Gln and Cys residues in place of Thr41 and Ser239 , respectively . WT actin has four Cys residues , but only one of them ( Cys374 ) is highly reactive [ 43 ] . Thus , we replaced Cys374 with Ala to produce T41Q / S239C / C374A and T41Q / G146V / S239C / C374A mutant actins . These actins were sequentially labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 – maleimide and Alexa Fluor 555 – cadaverine . Typical labeling efficiencies with Alexa Fluor 647 – maleimide and Alexa Fluor 555 – cadaverine were approximately 80 % and 20 % , respectively . These double - labeled actins are hereafter referred to as control FRET actin and G146V FRET actin , respectively . The FRET ac - tins were copolymerized with unlabeled and biotin - labeled WT or G146V actins at a molar ratio of 10 : 100 : 1 , and they were stabilized with phalloidin . These filaments were then subjected to single - molecule intramolecular FRET assays . All experiments were performed in the pres - ence of 1 mM ATP . We observed fluorescence from single actin subunits within filaments , as evidenced by bleaching of each fluorophore in one step ( Fig 2C and 2D ) . In this case , we observed inverse relationships between donor and acceptor emission intensities , as well as transition between distinct FRET states ( S2 Fig ) . Each histogram of FRET efficiencies , combined from 63 – 102 fluorescent spots in the absence or presence of either myosin , was fitted with multiple Gauss - ian distributions . The appropriate number of Gaussian distributions was determined from the BIC for each histogram . All of the FRET distributions were well fitted with the sum of three to five Gaussian models ( Fig 3A ) . These results suggest that both WT subunits and G146V sub - units took multiple distinct conformational states , each of which had a unique distance be - tween tips of the two major domains . However , we could not determine whether resolving the distributions to four or five distinct populations , suggested as appropriate by the BIC , is meaningful . Mean values of each Gaussian distribution of FRET efficiencies of control FRET subunits in the absence of myosin were 0 . 049 , 0 . 52 , 0 . 69 , and 0 . 88 ( Table 2 ) . The distances between fluoro - phores in these FRET states , as calculated from the equation R = R 0 ( 1 / E − 1 ) 1 / 6 under the as - sumption of random orientations of the two fluorophores , were 8 . 4 , 5 . 0 , 4 . 5 , and 3 . 7 nm . Distance of 8 . 4 nm is much larger than the size of an actin molecule ( ~ 5 nm ) , which means that this minor fraction of FRET represents inter - molecular FRET . Results of a recent electron microscopic analysis of skeletal actin filaments suggest that there are at least six different con - formations [ 7 ] .

To interpret the FRET data in a fitting - independent manner , we compared mean values of overall FRET efficiencies in each experimental condition . The mean value of FRET efficiency of G146V FRET actin in the absence of myosin was significantly lower than that of control FRET actin ( Fig 3B ) . This conformational difference should be correlated with the altered po - lymerization properties ( Fig 1 ) . However , the lower overall FRET efficiencies is opposite to what is expected from mutant actin ’ s slower depolymerization rate and lower critical concen - tration , and hence abundance of the flat conformation . Furthermore , they are not consistent with the prediction of the structural modeling ( S1 Fig ) . We suggest that this is presumably re - lated to the orientation of the fluorophores , which also affects FRET efficiencies . This is be - cause Gln41 can be labeled with Alexa 555 Fluor cadaverine when actin is in the monomeric Fig 2 . Intramolecular FRET measurement system .

These results suggest that an increase in the higher FRET state ( s ) is necessary for the motility of myosin II . The minor , very low FRET distribution in the control FRET actin disappeared , suggesting that myosin II also affects relationships between actin subunits . MV HMM decreased the FRET efficiencies of both the control and G146V FRET actins ( Fig 3A ) . Means of FRET efficiencies of control and G146V FRET actins were different , but the dif - ference was smaller than that in the presence of sk MII ( Fig 3B ) . Difference between requirements for actin conformation associated with motilities of myosins II and V It is well established that during the ATPase cycle , actin and myosin alternate between the strongly bound state and the weakly bound or detached state . Furthermore , the strongly bound state consists of several chemical states , including A (cid:129) M (cid:129) ADP (cid:129) Pi , A (cid:129) M (cid:129) ADP , and A (cid:129) M states [ 44 ] . Each actin subunit may undergo a cyclic conformational change concurrently with this mechanochemical cycle . However , the duration of the strongly bound state is on the order of milliseconds in the presence of saturating concentrations of ATP [ 45 ] , and it does not occupy a significant fraction of the 100 ms accumulation time to acquire one fluorescence image . There - fore , one may argue that even if the strongly bound state or its substate has a higher FRET effi - ciency , this hypothetical high FRET state is unlikely to change the FRET intensity averaged over 100 ms and thus unlikely to affect the distribution of the observed FRET efficiencies . This conclusion is consistent with the fact that very few of the observed fluorescent spots cyclically alternated between two distinct FRET efficiencies in the presence of sk MII HMM . However , the conformational change in an actin subunit induced by strong binding of a sin - gle sk MII HMM molecule might affect multiple neighboring actin subunits in the filaments in a cooperative manner [ 10 , 23 – 25 ] . If so , our FRET measurement might be able to detect the conformational changes induced by strongly bound sk MII HMM when the sk MII HMM con - centration was sufficiently high . It is also possible that , once transient strong interaction with a single sk MII HMM molecule had changed the conformation of an actin subunit , the new con - formation persisted after the HMM molecule had dissociated . This scenario is consistent with our earlier observation that spontaneous conformational switching of actin subunits was slow [ 37 ] . In either case , effects on the filament may be detectable even if the duration of each strong - binding event was very short . In contrast , the duration of the weakly bound state may be on the order of several hundred milliseconds under our conditions . This would be long enough to cover several consecutive data points and would affect the distribution of FRET intensities if the weakly bound cross - bridges increase the fraction of a particular conformation of actin . The preferred conformation may be either a new conformation absent in the control FRET actin without MII HMM or one of the four distinct distributions observed . One can interpret these latter possibilities from a different point of view , assuming that actin had at least two functionally distinct conformations in relation to interaction with sk MII HMM . One conformation is an off or refractory state , which binds only slowly to sk MII HMM carrying ADP and Pi , and / or does not produce large displacement and force even after it binds to sk MII HMM . The other conformation is an on state , which interacts with sk MII HMM and produces force and displacement efficiently . In this scenario , the on state has a higher FRET ef - ficiency than the off state , and the G146V mutant actin does not easily take the on state , either kinetically or thermodynamically . Consistent with this hypothesis , our earlier biochemical study suggests that the motility defect of G146V actin filaments with myosin II derives from Structural Dynamics of Actin PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0126262 May 6 , 2015 10 / 13 two defects ; i . e . , slower transition from the weakly bound state to the strongly bound state and the lower affinity during the strongly bound state [ 29 ] . The interaction of G146V actin filaments with myosin V produced normal velocity and force [ 29 ] , even though mean values of the FRET efficiencies during interaction with MV HMM were somewhat different between control and G146V actins ( Fig 3B ) . Similarly , Kubota et al . reported that M47A mutation of actin halved both gliding velocity and force due to myo - sin II , while it increased these parameters due to myosin V [ 46 ] . These results suggest the possi - bility that the mechanism for motility is qualitatively different between processive myosin V ( reviewed in [ 47 ] ) and non - processive myosin II , and accordingly , the roles of actin filaments in the motilities of myosin II and V are not identical . In this case , the conformation of actin fil - aments impaired by the G146V mutation is important only in the motility of myosin II . This view is consistent with a study by Prochniewicz et al . on transient phosphorescence anisotropy [ 10 ] , which showed that conformational states of actin induced by myosins II and V are differ - ent . However , an alternative , more conservative explanation is also possible . Because myosin V motor domains remain bound to actin filaments much longer than myosin II motor domains do , they may have the larger potential to cause the off state G146V actin subunits to switch to the on state . Nonetheless , it should be noted that conformational changes induced by MII and MV were distinct ( Fig 3A ) . Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the roles that actin conformations play in myosin motilities . Supporting Information S1 Fig . Environment around Val 146 .
