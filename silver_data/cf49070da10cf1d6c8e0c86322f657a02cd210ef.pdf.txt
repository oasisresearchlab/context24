Sunney Xie 1 In a living cell , gene expression—the transcription of DNA to messenger RNA followed by translation to protein—occurs stochastically , as a consequence of the low copy number of DNA and mRNA molecules involved 1 – 6 . These stochastic events of protein production are difﬁcult to observe directly with measure - ments on large ensembles of cells owing to lack of synchroniza - tion among cells . Measurements so far on single cells lack the sensitivity to resolve individual events of protein production . Here we demonstrate a microﬂuidic - based assay that allows real - time observation of the expression of b - galactosidase in living Escherichia coli cells with single molecule sensitivity . We observe that protein production occurs in bursts , with the number of molecules per burst following an exponential distri - bution . We show that the two key parameters of protein expression—the burst size and frequency—can be either deter - mined directly from real - time monitoring of protein production or extracted from a measurement of the steady - state copy number distribution in a population of cells . Application of this assay to probe gene expression in individual budding yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrates its generality . Many important proteins are expressed at low levels 7 , 8 , and are thus inaccessible by current genomic and proteomic techniques . This microﬂuidic single cell assay opens up possibilities for system - wide characterization of the expression of these low copy number proteins . b - galactosidase ( b - gal ) has been the standard reporter for gene expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells 9 – 12 . Only active as a tetramer , a single molecule of b - gal can produce a large number of ﬂuorescent product molecules by hydrolysing a synthetic ﬂuorogenic substrate ( Fig . 1b ) , leading to ampliﬁcation of the ﬂuorescent signal , as was ﬁrst demonstrated in 1961 ( ref . 13 ) . However , given its potential as a high - sensitivity cellular reporter , b - gal has an Achilles’ heel : its ﬂuorescent products are not retained in the cell 10 , because efﬂux pumps on the cell membrane actively and efﬁciently expel LETTERS Figure 1 | Single reporter molecule sensitivity in a microﬂuidic device . a , Schematic diagram of the microﬂuidic chamber used for the enzymatic assay .

As the ﬂuorescent product molecules are pumped to the surrounding medium and rapidly diffuse away , the advantage of enzymatic ampliﬁcation is lost . To circumvent the efﬂux problem , we trap cells in closed micro - ﬂuidic chambers , such that the ﬂuorescent product expelled from the cells can accumulate in the small volume of the chambers , recovering the ﬂuorescence signal due to enzymatic ampliﬁcation . The fast efﬂux rate and short mixing time of the ﬂuorescent molecules in the miniature chambers guarantee that the ﬂuorescence signal outside the cells accurately reﬂects the enzymatic activity inside . The microﬂuidic device is made of a soft polymer , polydimethyl - siloxane ( PDMS ) , and consists of a ﬂow layer that contains the cells and a top control layer ( Fig . 1a ) 15 , 16 . Actuation of two adjacent valves in the control layer forms an enclosure of dimensions 100 £ 100 £ 10 m m 3 ( 100 pl ) in which cells can be trapped and cultured 17 , 18 ( Fig . 1c , d ; see also Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . The micro - ﬂuidic chip is mounted on an inverted ﬂuorescence microscope and translated by a motorized stage , allowing multiplexing of data acquisition by repeatedly scanning the chambers . Typically , 100 chambers can be scanned within less than 2 min . Fluorescence is excited with a tightly focused laser beam ( Fig . 1a ) that does not directly illuminate the cell , avoiding cellular autoﬂuorescence and photo - damage to the cell . We ﬁrst show the ability to detect single enzyme molecules using this technique by injecting a diluted solution of puriﬁed b - gal enzyme and 300 m M of the ﬂuorogenic substrate ﬂuorescein - di - b - D - galactopyranoside ( FDG ) into the chambers 19 . Fluorescence sig - nals from different chambers increase with time , and the slopes give the rates of hydrolysis ( Fig . 1e ) . The distribution of hydrolysis rates measured in the different chambers shows quantized and evenly spaced peaks ( Fig . 1f ) . We attribute these discrete peaks to integer numbers of b - gal molecules . The spacing between the peaks is 60 pM min 2 1 , which gives a calibration for the rate of increase in ﬂuorescein concentration corresponding to one enzyme molecule in a chamber . Another challenge for using b - gal to monitor gene expression in live cells is that the cell wall acts as a barrier for FDG inﬂux . We quantify this effect in E . coli by measuring the hydrolysis rate for live cells compared to cells treated with chloroform , which completely permeabilizes cell membrane ( Supplementary Fig . S4a ) . The ratio of hydrolysis rates between these two cases is deﬁned as the permeability ratio , and is measured to be R ¼ 13 at 300 m m FDG . To increase FDG inﬂux , we transformed E . coli cells with a plasmid conferring ampicillin resistance and grew the cells in media with b - lactam antibiotics ( see Methods ) . Under these conditions , cell wall synthesis is partially inhibited , making the cells more permeable to FDG , as evident by a lower value of R ¼ 2 ^ 0 . 3 ( Supplementary Fig . S4b ) . In determining the number of enzyme molecules in live cells below , R ¼ 2 is used as a correction factor to the in vitro calibration ( Fig . 1f ) . We then monitored gene expression in live E . coli cells in real time . b - gal is expressed from the lacZ gene on the chromosomal DNA , which is under the control of the lac promoter . Cells are grown in glucose - containing medium without inducer to exponential phase ; hence the expression level is highly repressed 20 . We observed abrupt changes in hydrolysis rates in chambers with dividing cells , as shown in Fig . 2a , b . These step - wise increases in the rates indicate the stochastic burst - like expression of new b - gal molecules . We attribute the bursts to stochastic and transient dissociation events of the Lac repressor from the promoter , followed by transcription of mRNA , which is then translated into a few copies of the reporter protein before the mRNA is degraded . The expression of proteins from a given gene can be characterized by two key parameters : the average frequency of expression bursts per cell cycle , a ; and the average number of protein molecules per burst , b . Under conditions of exponential growth in minimal medium , the burst frequency for protein expression from the repressed E . coli lacZ gene is measured to be a ¼ 0 . 11 ^ 0 . 03 bursts per cell cycle . The average burst size is measured to be b ¼ 5 ^ 2 enzymes , or 20 ^ 8 monomers per burst , which is consistent with biochemical estimates of 25 – 30 b - gal monomers per mRNA 21 , 22 . This real - time assay also allows us to measure the distribution of the number of enzymes produced per burst ( Fig . 2c ) . It can be well ﬁtted with an exponential distribution , P ð n Þ ¼ C exp ð 2 n = b Þ , where n is the number of b - gal molecules per burst and C is a normalization constant . We attribute this distribution to the fact that the cellular lifetime of the mRNA is exponentially distributed 21 , 23 . Previously only theoretically predicted 1 , 24 , the exponential P ( n ) can be accounted for by the competition between mRNA degradation by Figure 2 | Quantitative real - time measurement of individual protein expression events in live E . coli cells . b - gal is under the control of a repressed lac promoter . a , Trace of a chamber containing dividing cells shows abrupt changes in hydrolysis rates ( arrows on black curve ) .

Our single - molecule experi - ment demonstrates the ability to provide quantitative real - time information on gene expression in a live cell . Stochasticity of gene expression is exhibited not only in the temporal evolution of protein production in a single cell , but also in the distribution of protein copy number in a population of cells at a particular time . Such distributions have been measured using ﬂow cytometry 3 , 4 or ﬂuorescence microscopy 2 , 5 , 6 , but have been limited to only high expression levels . Our method allows measurements of the reporter’s distribution in a cell population with single copy sensitivity . To do this , we treated E . coli cells with chloroform , which completely permeabilizes cell membrane and stops protein pro - duction , while keeping existing b - gal molecules active inside the cell ( Fig . 3b , inset ) . The treated cells are immediately injected into the microﬂuidic device together with FDG and the hydrolysis rate is measured . We ﬁrst demonstrate the detection of single enzyme molecules inside those chloroform - treated cells . The histogram of hydrolysis rates of all chambers shows quantized peaks ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . S12 ) . The spacing between peaks is in agreement with that measured in vitro ( Fig . 1f ) . We compiled a histogram of the number of b - gal molecules in chambers containing only a single cell ( Fig . 3b ) for cells cultured under the same repressed condition as in the real - time experiment . The mean of this distribution is m ¼ 1 . 2 ^ 0 . 4 copies of b - gal molecules per cell , and the standard deviation is j ¼ 3 . 3 . The mean agrees with the ensemble measurement of 1 ^ 0 . 5 b - gal per cell , as well as the observation that the average number of b - gal molecules per chamber increases with the number of cells trapped in a chamber with a slope of 0 . 9 enzymes per cell ( Fig . 3b inset ) . We created a model to relate the measured steady - state protein copy number distributions to the parameters a and b that are deﬁned above . We used a continuous form of the master equation 25 to analytically describe that distribution given the burst dynamics of protein production . We assume that : ( 1 ) distribution of protein molecules produced per expression event is exponential ; ( 2 ) expression events are temporally uncorrelated ; and ( 3 ) protein molecule copy numbers are halved at cell division . At steady - state , protein production is balanced by protein dilution due to cell growth and division . We found that the steady - state probability distribution of protein number per cell , p ( x ) , is a gamma distribution , which is uniquely determined by the parameters a and b ( Supplementary Information ) : p ð x Þ ¼ x a 2 1 e 2 x = b b a G ð a Þ ð 1 Þ where G denotes the gamma function . The parameters a and b are related to the mean , m , and standard deviation , j , by a ¼ m 2 / j 2 and b ¼ j 2 / m . Figure 3b shows that the data ﬁts well with equation ( 1 ) , with b ¼ 7 . 8 ^ 2 . 6 reporters per burst and a ¼ 0 . 16 ^ 0 . 05 bursts per cell cycle , which are consistent with the real - time data above within error bars . This demonstrates that the information about the underlying dynamic process , namely the values of a and b , is preserved in both the temporal ﬂuctuations in a single cell and the instantaneous variability within a population . Notably , the proﬁle of p ( x ) with a , 1 that we measured for the repressed lac operon is distinct from p ( x ) with a . 1 that was measured previously for the induced lac operon 2 . These correspond to two different regimes of equation ( 1 ) , schematically illustrated in Fig . 4 . For a , 1 , p ( x ) peaks at zero and a large fraction of cells contains no b - gal regardless of the burst size b ( Fig . 4a ) ; however , for Figure 4 | Two regimes of stochasticity in protein expression . Protein molecules are produced in bursts ( red ) , in addition to existing molecules ( blue ) , and diluted upon cell division , leading to a steady - state distribution , p ( x ) , of protein copy number , x , in the cell population . a , With a , 1 , p ( x ) peaks at x ¼ 0 and a large fraction of cells do not contain a single copyof the protein regardless of the burst size , b . The repressed lac operon is well described by this regime . b , With a . 1 , most cells contain the protein at some level . Both regimes can be described by the gamma distribution ( equation ( 1 ) ) .

LETTERS NATURE | Vol 440 | 16 March 2006 360 © 2006 Nature Publishing Group a . 1 , p ( x ) peaks at a non - zero x and most cells contain b - gal ( Fig . 4b ) . The proﬁle of p ( x ) for a , 1 may be signiﬁcant for the response of a population of E . coli cells to an increase in lactose concentration , which is transported into the cell by Lac permease . Because b - gal and Lac permease are expressed from the same operon , the large sub - population of cells containing no b - gal would generally have no Lac permease . These cells cannot respond to a rise of lactose concen - tration in the environment , and thus are distinct from cells contain - ing permease , which can respond and induce further expression of the lac operon by way of positive feedback . Thus , a , 1 provides a mechanism for ‘all - or - none’ induction responses that cells exhibit under suboptimal inducer concentrations 11 , 26 . This microﬂuidic assay can be applied to other cell types expres - sing b - gal as a reporter . We demonstrate applicability by measuring low - level expression from repressed promoters in yeast and mam - malian cells . Figure 3c shows the distribution of reporter number in a population of chloroform - treated Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( yKT32 ) cells expressing b - gal from the repressed GAL1 promoter . Here , the promoter – reporter fusion is carried on a low copy number plasmid . Cells were grown in the presence of glucose , such that the promoter is expected to be highly repressed . The average expression level is measured to be 0 . 4 ^ 0 . 07 reporters per cell , with j ¼ 0 . 6 . Using the above model ( equation ( 1 ) ) we can extract a and b from the measured mean and j : a ¼ 0 . 2 ^ 0 . 08 bursts per cell cycle and b ¼ 1 . 7 ^ 0 . 4 reporters per burst . This is consistent with our real - time experiments with permeable mutant yeast strain ( pdr1 2 pdr3 2 ) in which we do not observe abrupt large jumps as seen with E . coli . The low burst size inthis case may reﬂect thenon - optimalcodon usage of the bacterial reporter gene in yeast . Finally , we measured b - gal expression also from the ROSA26 promoter in embryonic mouse stem cells ( ES 54A ) . The average expression level was 425 ^ 80 enzymes per cell with j ¼ 375 ( Supplementary Information ) . The single cell version of the b - gal assay 9 presented here exhibits single molecule sensitivity for single prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells . This method , together with other newly developed single cell and single molecule techniques at the mRNA 27 , 28 and protein 29 levels , opens up possibilities for studying low - level gene expression in single cells of diverse cell types ( for example , transcription factors involved in gene regulation , or the leakiness of supposedly silenced promoters in differentiated cells ) . The ease of scaling up the microﬂuidic assay will enable characterization of gene expression on a whole - genome scale , especially in the unexplored regime of low expression levels . METHODS Cell strains and growth conditions . E . coli K12 ( MG1655 ) cells are transformed with a medium copy number plasmid , pBR293 . 3 , which confers ampicillin resistance . Cells were cultured in M9 media supplemented with amino acids and vitamins . Experiments were performed at 30 8 C . Under these conditions cells growwithacellcycletimeofabout145min ( SupplementaryFig . S1 ) . S . cerevisiae cells ( yKT0032 ) express b - gal from the GAL1 promoter , carried on a low - copy 2 m m plasmid ( pYES2 - lacZ ) . Cells were cultured in SD glucose – ura medium ( BD Bioscience ) at 30 8 C . Mouse embryonic stem cells ES54A ( Smo þ / 2 , Rosa26 lacZ þ ) and ES17 ( lacZ 2 ) from a 129SVJ background were cultured in a deﬁned medium to prevent differentiation . Single cell suspension is derived by adding trypsin to the cell culture and resuspending . Microﬂuidic chip fabrication . The master mould for the bottom channels is made by spin - coating positive photoresist ( Shipley SPR 220 - 7 , MicroChem ) ontoa siliconwafer ( UniversityWafer ) to a height of 7 m m . After patterning with high - resolution transparency mask ( PageWorks ) , the features are rounded by heating 15 , 16 . The control layer master is patterned with negative photoresist at 40 m m height . PDMS ( 10 : 1 Dow Corning Sylgard 184 A : B , Ellsworth Adhesives ) is spun onto the bottom master at 2 , 000r . p . m . for 1min and partially cured . Control layer PDMS mould is also partially cured and baked at the thickness of 5mm . The two PDMS pieces are aligned and cured overnight . The two - layer device is cut out , plasma oxidized for 3min and bonded permanently to a coverslip . Fluorescence detection . Fluorescence was excited by a tightly focused beam of a 488 - nm Ar - ion laser ( Melles Griot ) , with a power of 27 m W . A high NAobjective lens ( Nikon 60 £ Plan Apo NA ¼ 1 . 4 ) was used in an inverted ﬂuorescence microscope ( Nikon ) for excitation and collection of the ﬂuorescence signal . A CCD camera ( Andor Technology ) with on - chip ampliﬁcation and a large dynamic range was used for detection . Filters used were : excitation , 488nm narrow bandpass ; emission , 535nm / 50 bandpass ; dichroic , 495nm high pass ( Chroma Corp ) . Measurement of signals from multiple chambers was multiplexed by scanning the microﬂuidic chip using a motorized stage , ASI MS2000 XY ( ASI ) . Data analysis . Analysis of the ﬂuorescent signal was performed using Matlab ( Mathworks ) . Signal was averaged over the 100 brightest pixels from each image , and background was subtracted . The measured ﬂuorescence time traces F ( t ) were corrected for photobleaching and time derivative was taken to obtain the number of enzymes in a chamber as a function of time . A median ﬁlter of length 11 was used to smooth F ( t ) . With a sampling rate of once every 20s per chamber , the effective time resolution is about 4min . The error in calculating the parameters a and b from the copy number distribution was estimated with bootstrap analysis 30 . The original data set was re - sampled 1 , 000 times . The a and b parameters were calculated for each of those re - sampled data sets , from which the error was estimated . Additional details are provided in the Supplementary Information .
