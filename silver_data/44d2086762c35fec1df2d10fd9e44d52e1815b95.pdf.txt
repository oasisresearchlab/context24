During skin wound healing , a shift in keratin isoform expres - sion alters the composition of keratin filaments . How this change modulates cellular function to support epi - dermal remodeling remains unclear . We report an un - expected effect of keratin isoform variation on kinase signal transduction . Increased expression of wound - associated keratin 6A , but not of steady - state keratin 5 , potentiated keratinocyte migration and wound clo - sure without compromising epidermal stability by ac - tivating myosin motors . This pathway depended on isoform - specific interaction between intrinsically dis - ordered keratin head domains and non - filamentous vi - mentin shuttling myosin - activating kinases . These re - sults substantially expand the functional repertoire of intermediate filaments from their canonical role as me - chanical scaffolds to include roles as signaling scaf - folds that spatiotemporally organize signal transduc - tion cascades depending on isoform composition . Introduction Effective tissue barrier formation depends on keratin inter - mediate filaments 1 . Joined through desmosomes , keratin filaments form strong trans - cellular networks , which func - tion as mechanical scaffolds 2 . Fifty - four different keratin isoforms are expressed in an intricate pattern depending on issue , anatomic site , and differentiation state 3 . Ker - atin filaments are particularly important in the skin , where their disruption causes epidermal fragility in a number of diseases 4 . However , epidermal stability must be balanced with plasticity 1 . Too much stability relative to plasticity can limit remodeling , resulting , for example , in non - healing wounds 5 . Too much plasticity relative to stability can result in uncontrolled or abnormal remodeling , a feature of numer - ous skin diseases ranging from cancer to psoriasis 6 , 7 . The molecular mechanisms underlying the balance between epi - dermal stability and plasticity largely remain to be uncov - ered . During wound healing , the required balance between epi - dermal stability and plasticity shifts , as keratinocytes change shape , migrate into the wound area , and reform the epider - mal architecture 1 . These tissue - level processes are accom - panied at the cellular scale by increased expression of five wound - associated keratin isoforms : keratin 6A ( K6A ) , K6B , K6C , K16 , and K17 8 - 10 . Expression of wound - associated keratins also increases in other situations with elevated epi - dermal remodeling , including psoriasis 11 , 12 , squamous cell carcinoma 13 , hypertrophic scars 14 , and following tissue ex - pander placement 15 . While the selective expression of wound - associated ker - atins implies specialized functions in epidermal remodeling , identifying the roles individual keratin isoforms play in spe - cific cellular processes has been experimentally and con - ceptually challenging . Depleting or mutating individual ker - atins frequently disrupts keratin filament architecture and the more general mechanical scaffold function 16 . Partial re - dundancy between keratin isoforms further complicates the interpretation of monogenic models 17 . Wound - associated keratin knock - out mice often demonstrate prominent de - fects in epidermal integrity and keratinocyte cell - cell ad - hesion , but lack generalized wound - healing defects 18 - 21 . Similarly , disease - causing mutations in human wound - associated keratin genes broadly disrupt epidermal stability where the affected isoform is expressed 22 , 23 . Thus , while wound - associated keratins contribute to the canonical inter - mediate filament mechanical scaffold , it is less clear if addi - tional functions of these isoforms specifically promote plas - ticity during epidermal remodeling . In order to disentangle the specific contributions of wound - associated keratins to epidermal remodeling from the general function of keratin mechanical scaffolds , we took a gain - of - function rather than a loss - of - function ap - proach . We found that increased expression of wound - associated K6A , but not steady - state K5 , potentiated ker - atinocyte migration without compromising cell - cell adhesion . Rather than altering the mechanical response to external force , K6A expression increased cellular force generation via activation of actomyosin contractility . This role in sig - nal transduction was mediated by preferential interaction of the K6A intrinsically disordered head domain with non - filamentous vimentin . K6A - enriched keratin filaments and non - filamentous vimentin transiently anchored a signaling complex , spatially organizing regulatory kinases and myosin subunits to promote myosin activation . Thus , by wound - induced keratin isoform switching , epidermal cells amplify Nanes et al . | | May 4 , 2023 | 1 – 31 200 μ m H & E 500 μ m K5DAPI 200 μ m Human skin wound A B K17DAPI 200 μ m K6DAPI 200 μ m wound bed wound bed dermis epidermis migration front migration clot clot ep i de r m i s ep i de r m i s ep i de r m i s ep i de r m i s ◀ migration ◀ ◀ migration ◀ ◀ wound edge wound edge ▶ BS C intact epidermis intact epidermis intact epidermis ◀ migration ◀ ◀ migration ◀ V I M K R T 17 K R T 6 C K R T 16 K R T 6 B K R T 6 A K R T 2 K R T 5 K R T 14 K R T 1 K R T 10 DFU01DFU02DFU03DFU04DFU05DFU06FS01FS02FS03FS04FS05FS06 Krt U l ce r Krt Basal Diff .

These results highlight the complex interplay between the cytoskeleton and apparently diffuse pools of cytoplasmic proteins to spatiotemporally structure biochemical reactions . Results Wound - induced keratin switching in an epidermal cul - ture model Keratin expression change following wounding has been ob - served in animal models and humans 8 - 10 . We reproduced these findings in a human skin excision specimen , where we detected increased expression of wound - associated K6 and K17 at healing wound edges ( Figure 1A ) . We also reanalyzed published transcriptomics data of acute 24 and chronic wounds 25 with a focus on intermediate filament ex - pression and found strongly increased expression of all five wound - associated keratin genes ( Figure 1B ) . However , wound - induced keratin switching has not previously been observed in cultured keratinocytes . Furthermore , cultured keratinocytes often express wound - associated keratins at baseline 26 , possibly reflecting the increased proliferative rate of keratinocytes in culture 27 . This has complicated ef - forts to understand the implications of keratin switching at the cellular and subcellular levels . Consistent with prior reports 28 , 29 , we found that an hTERT and Cdk - 4 immortalized human keratinocyte cell line grown in submerged monolayer culture expressed steady - state basal level keratins K5 and K14 and wound - associated K6 and K17 ( Figure S1A ) . Steady - state differentiated keratins K1 and K10 were barely detectable ( Figure S1A ) , as ex - pected for a basal keratinocyte phenotype . Immunofluo - rescence of monolayer scratch wounds did not show any change in expression of K6 or K17 relative to K5 at the wound edge ( Figure 2A - B ) . Similarly , bulk qRT - PCR did not show any change in wound - associated keratin transcript lev - els in scratched keratinocyte monolayers compared to un - wounded controls ( Figure 2C ) . While keratin expression remained stable in submerged monolayer culture , keratinocytes at an air - liquid interface formed a multilevel structure undergoing differentiation , with increased expression of K10 in the upper layers ( Figure 2D - E ) , closely resembling the stratified squamous architecture of the epidermis 30 . We leveraged these stratified epidermal cultures to create a three - dimensional wound model . Cul - tures were grown within a barrier mold , followed by barrier removal to allow keratinocyte migration ( Figure 2F ) . In stark contrast to monolayer scratch wounds , wound - associated K6 and K17 expression was notably increased at the mi - grating edge of stratified cultures ( Figure 2F ) . The presence of wound - induced keratin switching in the epidermal culture model prompted us to more closely examine the function of wound - associated keratins in this system .

Prior attempts to knock down or delete keratin genes have resulted in prominent loss of cell - cell adhesion and decreased mechanical integrity 31 - 34 . To circumvent such global effects , we took a gain - of - function approach and co - expressed fluorescently tagged K6A , a wound - associated keratin , and K5 , the closest steady - state paralog to K6A , and used fluorescence activated cell sorting to isolate cell populations with different relative keratin expression ( Figure 3A ) . We created K5 high / K6A low ( K5 high ) and K5 low / K6A high ( K6A high ) cell lines with moderately increased ( approxi - mately 35 % ) levels of each keratin ( Figures 3B and S1B ) . Increasing K5 or K6A protein levels did not change endoge - nous protein or transcript levels of other keratins ( Figure S1C - D ) or affect cell proliferation ( Figure 3C ) . Importantly , K5 high and K6A high cells maintained equivalent cell - cell ad - hesion capacity , with similar junction morphology and thick - ness on transmission electron microscopy ( Figure 3D ) , sim - ilar numbers of desmosomes and adherens junctions ( Fig - ure 3E ) , and similar monolayer strengths as measured by dispase fragmentation assays ( Figure 3F ) . We then proceeded to test the migration potential of K5 high and K6A high keratinocytes . In three - dimensional epi - dermal migration assays , K6A high epidermal cultures mi - grated farther than K5 high epidermal cultures over a 12 - hour period ( Figure 3G ) . We further took advantage of the bright fluorescence signals from the tagged keratins to en - able live imaging of paired K5 high and K6A high epidermal cul - tures following removal of a separating barrier ( Figure 3H ) . While the partially translucent polycarbonate filter limited im - age quality , the fluorescence signal was sufficient to iden - tify and track the migration edges using custom software ( Figure 3H and Video 1 ) 35 . We observed that K6A high epi - dermal cultures moved faster into the gap than their K5 high counterparts , and K6A high cultures maintained their migra - tion advantage over a 20 - hour migration period ( Figure 3I - Nanes et al . | Keratin isoforms modulate motility signals | 3 K ) . Therefore , increased expression of wound - associated K6A offers a significant benefit to wound closure in three - dimensional epidermal cultures . Wound - associated K6A supports migration in monolay - ers and individual cells In order to perform high - resolution imaging of potential differences in cytoskeletal organization and dynamics be - tween K5 high and K6A high cells , we turned to a monolayer wound healing assay . However , in contrast to the three - dimensional epidermal wound model , we were initially un - able to identify a clear difference in migration speed be - tween K5 high and K6A high monolayers ( Figure S2A - D and Video 2 ) . Since the monolayer migration assay had sig - nificant wound - to - wound variability ( Figure S2B ) , we won - dered whether subtle but systematic differences in migration behavior between individual K6A high and K5 high cells were missed in the coarser population level analysis . To test this possibility , we created a mosaic population of keratinocytes including K5 high , K6A high , K5 high / K6A high , and K5 low / K6A low cells and performed live imaging of the lentiviral transduction K5 - mNG K6A - mRb fluorescently - tagged keratin constructs keratinocytes K5 high K6A high K5 hi K6A hi K5 lo K6A lo K5 K6 β - actin wt K5 high K6A high K5 - G K6 - R 50kD 75kD 50kD 75kD 37kD A B C F D E G H I J K5 high K6A high P r e - s h ea r P o s t - s h ea r 0 5 10 15 K5 high K6A high Cell line F r ag m en t s K5 high K6A high 50 μ m 50 μ m 12h migration P < . 01 0 100 200 300 400 K 5 h i g h K 6 A h i g h Cell line G ap w i d t h ( µ m ) K6A 6hr 12hr 18hr 24hr 150 μ m K5 25µm 50µm 100µm 150µm 0 300 600 900 0 300 600 900 0 300 600 900 0 300 600 900 0 300 600 900 K5 high side ( min ) K 6 A h i gh s i de ( m i n ) Paired cultures K5 faster K6A faster Time to reach distance P < 10 - 6 P < 10 - 6 P < 10 - 6 P < 10 - 5 0 5 10 15 K 5 h i g h K 6 A h i g h Cell line S peed ( µ m / h r ) P < 10 - 3 − 100 0 100 200 0 500 1000 1500 Time ( min ) K 6 A h i gh d i s t . − K 5 h i gh d i s t .

We applied particle image velocimetry to track local mi - gration throughout the monolayer ( Figure 4B , bottom; Video 3 , right ) 35 and segmented the monolayers into different ker - atin expression regions ( Figure 4B , top; Video 3 , left ) , per - mitting comparison of migration speeds between keratin ex - pression regions within the same wound and controlling for between - wound variability . All wounds followed a similar pattern . After scratching the monolayer with a pipette tip , the overall migration speed rapidly increased to a peak followed by slow deceleration , though the height and timing of the peak varied between ex - perimental repeats ( Figure 4C ) . Around the time of the over - all migration speed peak , K6A high regions exhibited a small , but consistent , migration advantage ( Figure 4D ) . In the large majority ( 31 of 36 ) of wounds , K6A high regions had higher speeds than K5 high regions ( Figure 4E ) . K6A high regions also had higher speeds than K5 high / K6A high and K5 low / K6A low re - gions , and K5 high / K6A high regions had higher speeds than K5 high regions , indicating a dose - dependent effect ( Figure 4E ) . Interestingly , the K6A high migration advantage was transient . By 2 hours after the migration peak , K5 high region speeds began to approach those of the K6A high regions ( Fig - ure 4F and Video 4 ) . Consistent with these results , K6A high cells were modestly enriched near the wound edge of a mo - saic population monolayer fixed after 18 - hours of migration ( Figure S2E ) . Given that K5 high and K6A high keratinocytes retain sim - ilar cell - cell adhesion properties ( Figure 3D - F ) , we asked whether the K6A high migration advantage was solely an emergent property of collective migration or if it could also be detected in individual keratinocytes . To address this ques - tion , we seeded K5 high and K6A high cells at low density and tracked their movement over 12 - hours using live imaging ( Figure 4G and Video 5 ) . Much like in the monolayer mi - gration assays , K6A high cells displayed a small advantage in migration speed and displacement , which peaked 4 to 8 - hours after seeding ( Figure 4G - I ) . Also similar to monolayer migration , the migration advantage was temporary , with the differences between K5 high and K6A high cells becoming less apparent by 8 to 12 - hours after seeding ( Figure 4G - I ) . Thus , wound - associated K6A transiently potentiates keratinocyte migration at least in part through a cell autonomous effect . Wound - associated K6A alters keratin filament dynam - ics To address how the relative levels of keratin isoforms affect migration , we examined possible differences in keratin fil - ament organization between K5 high and K6A high cells . We imaged keratin filaments over time and used a computer vi - sion pipeline to segment the filament networks ( Figure 5A - B and Video 6 ) 36 . In snapshots , the K5 high and K6A high fila - ment networks were similar . K5 high filament networks ap - peared to contain a somewhat higher number of very short filaments ( Figure S3A ) , and an associated slight increase in overall filament density ( Figure S3B ) , compared to K6A high networks , possibly reflecting a slight difference in the imag - ing properties of the two fluorescent tags . Filament curva - ture was indistinguishable between K5 high and K6A high cells ( Figure S3C - E ) . However , when analyzed over time , K5 high filaments displayed larger intracellular displacements than K6A high filaments ( Figure 5A - B ) . To quantify differences in filament network dynamics , we created a metric reflecting changes in position and orientation of filaments between timepoints at one - minute intervals 36 . Each point on the filament network at baseline is scored by the distance and difference in orientation of the nearest filament in the next considered timepoint ( Figure 5C ) . We then smoothed the local scores to generate contin - uous filament dynamics score maps and averaged over indi - vidual cells ( Figure 5D ) . Comparing K5 high to K6A high cells , we found that K6A systematically decreased intracellular dynamics of keratin filaments ( Figure 5E ) . We confirmed that the difference in filament dynamics between K5 high and K6A high cells could not be explained by the small differences in number of very short filaments or filament density ( Figure S3F - G ) . We further extended this approach using two - color live imaging of K5 high , K6A high , and K5 high / K6A high cells , allow - ing us to segment and calculate filament dynamics scores Previous page : Figure 3 .

Cultured keratinocytes were transduced with lentivirus to express tagged K5 and K6A , then divided by fluorescence activated cell sorting into different populations including those with high levels of K5 ( K5 high ) , high levels of K6A ( K6A high ) , high levels of both keratins ( K5 hi K6A hi ) , and low levels of both keratins ( K5 lo K6A lo ) .

We found a dose - dependent effect of K6A on filament dynamics , with the highest dynamics scores for K5 high cells , the lowest dynamics for K6A high cells , and intermediate dy - namics for K5 high / K6A high cells ( Figure S3L ) . Furthermore , we could compare filament segmentations and dynamics scores between the K5 and K6A channels in K5 high / K6A high cells . Given the known propensity for individual keratins to intermix within filament networks 37 , K5 and K6A network segmentations overlapped considerably , as expected ( Fig - ure S3H and Video 6 ) . Additionally , K5 and K6A dynamics scores for K5 high / K6A high cells were highly correlated , with - out evidence of bias between detection channels ( Figure S3M ) . Taken together , these results establish a direct rela - tionship between the mixture of keratin isoforms assembled into filaments and the dynamics of the networks that those filaments form . The filament dynamics score is a composite measure of both intrinsic properties of the filaments , such as stiffness , and extrinsic interactions between the filament network and other cellular components , such as motor proteins .

Keratin proteins are composed of a central alpha helical rod domain flanked by intrinsically disordered head and tail domains 38 , 39 . To determine which domain was responsible for the difference in filament dynamics , we created chimeric keratin constructs composed of the head and tail domains of K5 or K6A fused to the rod domain from the opposite ker - atin ( K5 h 6 r 5 t and K6 h 5 r 6 t ) . Upon expressing each of these chimeras in cultured keratinocytes , we found that K6 h 5 r 6 t decreased filament dynamics compared to K5 h 6 r 5 t ( Figure 5F ) . We further created chimeric keratins containing only the head or tail domain of K6A fused to the remainder of K5 ( K6A h 5 rt and K5 hr 6A t ) and determined that the K6A head domain alone was sufficient to decrease filament dynamics ( Figure 5G ) , while the K6A tail domain had no effect ( Fig - ure 5H ) . Thus , the intrinsically disordered K6A head domain , rather than the structural rod domain , is responsible for de - creasing keratin filament dynamics . Because the head domain has not been directly impli - cated in keratin filament structure 39 , this result turned our at - tention to potential interactions between keratins and other cellular components . One such interaction implicates the actomyosin force - generating machinery , which could drive both keratin filament dynamics and cell migration . We rea - soned that if a difference in actomyosin contractility was re - sponsible for the difference between K5 high and K6A high fil - ament dynamics , inhibiting actomyosin contractility would reduce that effect . Indeed , we found that myosin inhibitor Blebbistatin completely eliminated the difference between K5 high and K6A high filament dynamics ( Figure S4A ) , while two upstream ROCK inhibitors had smaller effects ( Figure S4B ) . This result led us to investigate potential interde - pendence between keratin filament composition and acto - myosin force generation . Wound - associated K6A increases cellular force gener - ation by activating myosin To directly test whether changing keratin filament composi - tion affects cellular force generation , we compared the abil - ity of K5 high and K6A high cells to deform an elastic substrate using traction force microscopy 40 . We found that K6A high cells generated increased traction forces and strain energy compared to K5 high cells ( Figures 6A and S4C ) . Further - more , this effect was reproduced by a cell line expressing the K6A h 5 rt chimera ( Figure 6B and S4D ) , indicating that , as with filament dynamics , traction force generation was mod - ulated by differences in keratin head domains . Importantly , the increased strain energy , which measures the total work of contraction executed by the cell , cannot be explained by changes in mechanical properties such as filament elastic - ity or differences in organization of cell - matrix adhesions . This finding directly links shifts in the abundance of wound - associated K6A to cellular force generation . Keratin filaments are not known to directly generate force . Rather , contractile forces are generated by myosin motor proteins linked to the actin cytoskeleton 41 . Non - muscle myosin activation occurs through phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain ( pRLC ) 42 , 43 . To directly compare pRLC between K5 high and K6A high cells , we employed a proximity ligation assay , which uses two primary antibod - ies raised in different species , oligonucleotide - conjugated secondary antibodies , and rolling - circle amplification to de - tect colocalization between two antigens ( Figure 6C ) 44 . We probed for colocalization of myosin heavy chain ( MYH9 ) and pRLC in a mosaic culture of K5 high and K6A high ker - atinocytes . Consistent with the finding of increased contrac - tility of K6A high cells , we measured increased colocalization of pRLC with MYH9 , indicating increased myosin activation , in K6A high cells compared to K5 high cells ( Figure 6D ) . We further probed for colocalization of pRLC with keratin filaments using either antibodies against K5 or K17 . In both cases , we detected increased colocalizations in K6A high cells compared to K5 high cells ( Figure 6E - F ) , suggesting that myosin motors in the neighborhood of keratin filaments are more frequently activated when the relative amount of K6A is increased . Importantly , the colocalization between to - tal regulatory light chain and K5 or K17 was similar or de - creased in K6A high cells compared to K5 high cells ( Figure 6G - H ) , confirming that increased detection of pRLC near K6A high filaments reflects an increase in myosin activation , not merely a higher amount of total myosin near keratin fil - aments . Keratin filament composition influences keratin filament - associated proteins We next asked how changing keratin filament composition could alter myosin activation . We hypothesized that ker - atin filaments might serve as a platform to spatially organize components of a signaling pathway leading to RLC phos - phorylation . If this was the case , changing keratin filament composition might alter the affinity of keratin filaments for components of such a signaling pathway , increasing or de - creasing signal transduction . Reliable identification of ker - atin filament binding partners has been difficult for two rea - sons .

Second , epidermal keratin filaments are highly insoluble; the harsh , high - salt buffers capable of completely solubilizing keratin filaments likely disrupt inter - actions between keratins and other proteins 46 . While meth - ods have been developed to immunoprecipitate epidermal keratins using milder detergents 46 , 47 , it remains unclear if they reliably capture filamentous keratin versus soluble ker - atin monomers or smaller aggregates . To overcome this challenge , we created keratinocyte cell lines expressing K5 or K6A fused to a promiscuous biotin ligase 48 . This allowed us to perform a proteomics screen comparing biotinylated proteins from each cell line 49 , iden - tifying in a differential manner proteins preferentially asso - ciated with keratin filaments in K5 high cells versus K6A high cells ( Figure 7A ) . These hits were implicated in a variety of functional processes , including cytoskeletal organization ( Figure S5 ) . Wound - associated K6A recruits non - filamentous vi - mentin to keratin filaments To our great surprise , among the proteins with overall high keratin filament association , vimentin showed the high - est differential association between K6A high and K5 high cells ( Figure 7A - B ) . Vimentin , a type III intermediate fila - ment protein , is the principal intermediate filament com - ponent in mesenchymal cells , and its expression in ep - ithelial cells is associated with an epithelial to mesenchy - mal transition 50 . While vimentin expression is increased at migration edges in some non - keratinocyte 51 , 52 and cul - tured keratinocyte models 53 , 54 , vimentin expression is not reliably induced in skin wounds where wound - induced ker - atin switching is clearly detectable ( Figure 1B ) . Furthermore , Nanes et al . | Keratin isoforms modulate motility signals | 9 isoform - specific interactions between keratin filaments and vimentin have not previously been reported . We first confirmed that our keratinocyte cell lines did ex - press low levels of vimentin , with relatively increased vi - mentin in K6A high cells compared to K5 high cells ( Figure 7C ) . However , by immunofluorescence , vimentin filaments could be detected only in a very small fraction of keratinocytes ( Figure S6 ) .

The large majority of keratinocytes displayed no distinct vi - mentin structures at all , only a diffuse or speckled pattern ( Figure S6 ) . Vimentin filaments were somewhat more easily found at wound edges , ( Figure S6A ) but they could also be found in monolayer interiors ( Figure S6B ) . Given the rarity of keratinocytes with vimentin filaments , we were not able to quantify their frequency precisely . However , there was no obvious difference in vimentin pattern between K5 high and K6A high cells . Notably , when vimentin filaments were iden - tified , they did not form along keratin filaments ( Figure S6 ) , and in some cases formed in a distinct vertical plane from the keratin filament network ( Figure S6B ) . Consistent with the proteomic screen , we identified in - creased association between vimentin and keratins in K6A high cells compared to K5 high cells by a proximity liga - tion assay , regardless of whether K5 or K17 was used as the bait ( Figure 7D - E ) . Furthermore , the increased associa - tion between vimentin and keratin filaments in K6A high cells was a population effect , not driven by a small number of outlier cells which might represent those with vimentin fila - ments ( Figures 7D - E and S6 ) . Together , these data led us to the conclusion that a non - filamentous pool of vimentin in - teracts with keratin filaments , preferentially with the wound - associated keratin isoform K6A . Non - filamentous vimentin shuttles myosin - activating kinases to K6A - contianing keratin filaments How could association between non - filamentous vimentin and keratin promote actomyosin contractility through phos - phorylation of myosin regulatory light chain ? We considered the possibility that non - filamentous vimentin operates as a shuttle for kinases , bringing them into the proximity of ker - atin filaments , with a bias toward filaments with high K6A content . Vimentin was previously identified as a phosphory - lation target for ROCK 56 , which also targets RLC 57 , imply - ing at least transient ROCK - vimentin binding . While we de - tected only infrequent colocalization between vimentin and ROCK by proximity ligation ( Figure 7F ) , we did detect fre - quent colocalization between vimentin and MLCK ( Figure 7G ) , another RLC activator 42 . Neither ROCK nor MLCK were differentially associated with vimentin in K5 high com - pared to K6A high cells ( Figure 7F - G ) . However , once dif - ferentially shuttled to keratin filaments by vimentin , these kinases would be positioned near other keratin - associated proteins . Myosin subunits were previously shown to bind keratins 32 , a finding recapitulated in our proteomics screen regardless of keratin isoform composition ( Figure 7B ) . Thus , increasing the amount of K6A in keratin filaments would in - crease recruitment of regulatory kinases to activate myosin ( Figure 7H ) . This model implies a central role for vimentin mediat - ing the activation of myosin and increased force genera - tion with increased expression of wound - associated K6A . To test this , we knocked down vimentin in K5 high and K6A h 5 rt keratinocyte cell lines using lentiviral shRNA vectors ( Fig - ures 7I and S7A ) . Vimentin knockdown was poorly toler - ated , with decreased proliferation and increased cell death within one week of shRNA expression ( Figure 7J - K ) , con - sistent with previously reported findings in primary human keratinocytes 58 , 59 . Thus , we were unable to establish stable vimentin - depleted cell lines . However , by transient shRNA expression , we could perform traction force microscopy on vimentin knockdown keratinocytes and confirmed that vimentin depletion decreased traction force generation in K6A h 5 rt cells ( Figure 7L ) . Vimentin depletion only slightly decreased traction force generation in K5 high cells , likely re - flecting the lower baseline contractility of K5 high cells com - Previous page : Figure 7 .

Nanes et al . | Keratin isoforms modulate motility signals | 11 pared to K6A h 5 rt cells ( Figure 7M ) . Consistent with this , vi - mentin knockdown decreased myosin activation in K6A high cells to a level similar to that of K5 high cells ( Figures 7N and S7B ) . Furthermore , vimentin knockdown reversed the effect of K6A on keratin filament dynamics . Compared to a scrambled shRNA control , vimentin shRNA increased fila - ment dynamics in K6A h 5 rt cells nearly to the level seen in K5 high cells ( Figures 7O and S7C ) . Filament dynamics were little changed by vimentin knockdown in K5 high cells ( Figures 7O and S7C ) . Altogether , these results show that increased traction force generation and decreased filament dynamics caused by wound - associated K6A both depend on the non - filamentous vimentin pool acting as a shuttle for kinases . Discussion Our data reveal an unexpected role for keratin filaments as signaling scaffolds in addition to their canonical role as mechanical scaffolds . Increasing expression of wound - associated K6A supports epidermal remodeling not by alter - ing the cell’s mechanical capacity for force resistance , but by organizing molecular signals that activate force generation to drive migration . This signal transduction cascade relies on an isoform - preferential interaction between the intrinsi - cally disordered K6A head domain and non - filamentous vi - mentin shuttling myosin activating kinases . As the amount of K6A incorporated into keratin filaments increases , more kinase is shuttled to keratin filaments where it phosphory - lates nearby RLC , leading to myosin activation . The proposed pathway establishes functional coupling between the cellular machinery of force resistance and force generation during epidermal remodeling , exactly the context where the balance between epidermal stability and plas - ticity needs to shift . Importantly , keratin isoform switching modulates signaling scaffold function without disrupting me - chanical scaffold function . During wound healing , the epi - dermis remains subject to mechanical stress , both from the usual external insults and directly resulting from tissue re - modeling , so the keratin mechanical scaffold remains es - sential . Our finding that increased K6A expression does not impair epidermal stability fits with this requirement , as do prior studies demonstrating increased keratinocyte fragility during wound healing when all K6 isoforms are deleted 18 , 31 . Increased cellular force generation necessarily increases cell exposure to mechanical stress . Thus , the ability of keratins to functionally couple force resistance and force generation could be broadly important . One possibility is that an actomyosin - activating signaling cascade dependent on keratin filaments restricts force generation in cells lack - ing a keratin filament network sufficient to maintain struc - tural integrity under stress . A second intriguing hypothesis comes from our seemingly paradoxical observation that el - evated K6A expression decreases intracellular movement of keratin filaments yet increases force generation . We of - fer as a plausible explanation that non - filamentous vimentin acts not only as a kinase shuttle , but also as a cytoplas - mic glue , sticking keratin filaments to other cellular compo - nents such as actomyosin stress fibers 60 , 61 , thus decreas - ing K6A - enriched keratin filament dynamics under a given force . Wound - associated keratins might then function both to activate actomyosin contractility and to stabilize otherwise brittle actin structures 62 . Expansive additional investigation will be needed to evaluate these possibilities . Our results also highlight an underappreciated role of vimentin in epithelial tissues . In contexts such as devel - opment and cancer metastasis , vimentin expression is a marker of epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) 63 , but in stable epithelia vimentin has been thought to be irrele - vant . Wound healing can be considered a reversible forme fruste of EMT 63 , and defective wound healing is among the most prominent phenotypes of a vimentin knock - out mouse 64 . Although this has been attributed to defects in der - mal fibroblasts 65 , our results suggest that the keratinocytes themselves may significantly contribute to the phenotype because of their dependence on vimentin as a shuttle for molecular signals . Furthermore , our finding that vimentin knockdown compromises keratinocyte growth in culture de - spite the absence of vimentin filaments , consistent with pre - viously reported findings 58 , 59 , underscores the importance of non - filamentous vimentin 66 for cellular homeostasis , even in epithelial cells . Given the intricate pattern of keratin isoform expres - sion depending on tissue , anatomic site , and differentiation state 3 , keratin isoform differences are very likely to support signal transduction cascades in additional contexts . No - tably , the structural rod domain is highly conserved between keratin isoforms , suggesting little opportunity to influence the mechanical scaffold 38 . However , the intrinsically disor - dered head and tail domains are highly variable between isoforms 38 . Recent reports that intermediate filament head and tail domains interact through labile cross - β - strand poly - merization establish a thus far undiscussed potential for cell regulation through complex interaction networks between the intermediate filament cytoskeleton and other cytoplas - mic proteins and subcellular structures 67 , 68 . Such interac - tions could allow intermediate filaments to spatiotemporally organize a variety of biochemical processes , akin to the sig - naling pathway leading to actomyosin activation by wound - associated K6A identified here . Thus , this study sets the stage for investigations of the diversity of intermediate fila - ment interactions as a new regulatory motif in the adaptive control of cell function .

Jerry Shay ( UT Southwestern Medical Center ) . This cell line was de - veloped from human foreskin keratinocytes through expression of HTERT and CDK4 1 , 2 . Unless otherwise specified , keratinocytes were cultured on tissue - culture treated plastic coated with bovine type I collagen ( PureCol , Advanced Biomatrix # 5005 ) by pre - incubating dishes in a 100 μg / mL colla - gen solution for 30 minutes . Cells were maintained in Keratinocyte serum - free medium ( K - SFM; Gibco # 17005042 ) with the included 5 ng / mL hu - man recombinant epidermal growth factor and 50 mg / mL bovine pituitary extract supplements according to the manufacturer’s instructions in a hu - midified incubator at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . K - SFM contains a low calcium concentration which supports keratinocyte growth without inducing differ - entiation , but which also limits desmosome formation 3 . To induce desmo - some formation and support differentiation for certain experiments , we de - veloped a keratinocyte differentiation medium based on a simplification of the classic Rheinwald and Green formula 4 , 5 . This medium was com - posed of fully - supplemented K - SFM mixed in equal parts with DMEM / F12 ( Gibco # 11320033 ) and additionally supplemented with 2 % fetal bovine serum ( Sigma F0926 ) . HEK293 cells ( a gift from H . Choe ) used for gener - ation of lentiviral particles were maintained in DMEM ( Gibco # 11995 - 065 ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Sigma F0926 ) and antibiotic – antimycotic reagent ( Gibco # 15240 - 062 ) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . All cell lines were periodically tested for mycoplasma using a PCR - based Genlantis Mycoscope Detection Kit ( MY01100 ) . Plasmids Primer and synthetic DNA sequences ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) used to assemble the following constructs are provided in Table S1 . Keratin sequences were cloned by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) from pBabe - RFP1 - KRT5 - hygro ( Addgene # 58493 ) and pDONR22 - KRT6A ( DNASU clone HsCD00039474 ) and inserted into pLVX - IRES - Puro or pLVX - IRES - Neolentiviralexpressionvectors ( Clontech ) withC - terminalflu - orescent tags using seamless cloning ( HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix , New England Biolabs ) . The pLVX - KRT5 - mNG - IRES - Puro construct in - cludes an mNeonGreen ( Allele Biotechnology ) 6 sequence in - frame with the KRT5 sequence separated by a short peptide linker ( DPAFLY ) . Similarly , the pLVX - KRT6A - mRb - IRES - Neo construct includes an mRuby2 ( Addgene # 40260 ) 7 sequence in - frame with the KRT6A sequence separated by the same linker . Keratin head / tail domain chimera constructs were assembled using seamless cloning into pLVX - IRES - Puro , with keratin domains cloned from the above pLVX - KRT5 - mNG - IRES - Puro and pLVX - KRT6A - mRb - IRES - Neo constructs by PCR . Keratin domains were defined based on NCBI Ref - erence Sequence annotations ( NP _ 000415 . 2 , NP _ 005545 . 1 ) . Specifically , the K5 head and tail domains included amino acids 1 - 167 and 478 - 590 re - spectively; the K6A head and tail domains included amino acids 1 - 162 and 473 - 564 respectively . For proximity biotin labeling experiments , the sequence of miniTurbo , a small promiscuous biotin ligase 8 , was synthesized with a C - terminal Flag tag and flanking XbaI and BamHI restriction sites . This fragment was then inserted into pLVX - IRES - Puro using the XbaI and BamHI sites . Finally , the KRT5 and KRT6A sequences were amplified by PCR from the above pLVX - KRT5 - mNG - IRES - Puro and pLVX - KRT6A - mRb - IRES - Neo constructs and inserted in - frame and N - terminal to the biotin ligase with a short peptide linker ( DPAFSR ) using seamless cloning . To create a marker construct for these experiments , EGFP from pEGFP - C1 ( Clontech ) was inserted into pLVX - IRES - Puro using the SnaBI and BamHI restriction sites . For shRNA experiments , pLKO . 1 - Scrambled ( Addgene # 136035 ) 9 was modified to express H2B - mRuby3 for visual identification of trans - duced cells based on a nuclear fluorescence signal 10 . The H2B - mRuby3 sequence was synthesized and inserted into pLKO . 1 in place of the existing PuroR sequence using BamHI and KpnI restriction sites . Vimentin targeting sequences for shRNA constructs were se - lected from the Genetic Perturbation Platform Web Portal ( Broad Insti - tute; https : / / portals . broadinstitute . org / gpp / ) . Complementary primers were synthesized and annealed , then cloned into pLKO1 - H2B - mRuby3 us - ing AgeI and EcoRI restriction sites . The clones selected for shVim # 1 ( TRCN0000029120 ) and shVim # 2 ( TRCN0000029119 ) have , respectively , moderate and high predicted knockdown performance . Lentivirus transduction and cell line selection Lentiviral particles were generated using the pLVX system ( Clontech ) with packaging vectors psPAX2 and pMD2 . G ( Addgene plasmids # 12260 and # 12259 ) . HEK293 cells were transfected with expression and packing plasmids following standard calcium phosphate or polyethylenimine ( Poly - sciences # 23966 ) protocols . Supernatant was collected two days after transfection , filtered through 0 . 45 - μm mixed cellulose esters membrane sy - ringe filters ( Fisher Scientific # 09 - 720 - 005 ) and incubated on target cells overnight . After multiple days of culture and cell expansion , cells express - ing the relevant fluorescent marker were collected on FACS Aria II SORP flow cytometer equipped with 405 nm , 488 nm , 561 nm , and 633 nm lasers ( Beckton Dickinson ) and returned to culture . Western blotting Cells were grown to confluence and switched to differentiation medium 24 hours prior to sample collection . Because keratin filaments are highly in - soluble , a high - ionic - strength urea buffer was used in place of a standard lysis buffer 11 . The 6 . 5 M urea lysis buffer also contained 50 mM tris , 1 mM EGTA , 2 mM DTT , 50 mM sodium fluoride , 1 mM sodium vanadate , and Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( ThermoFisher # 78430 ) , and was ad - justed to pH 7 . 5 . After washing twice with PBS , cells were collected into urea lysis buffer using a cell scraper , then incubated at 4 °C for 20 min - utes on a shaker . The lysates were then sonicated using a Fisherbrand Model 505 Sonic Dismembrator ( ThermoFisher ) twice for 10 seconds at 20 % power with a 10 second intervening rest . Any remaining insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 16 . 1×10 3 g for 20 minutes at 4 °C , and the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube . Protein concentra - tions were measured using a BCA assay ( ThermoFisher # 23228 ) . Laemmli sample buffer ( BioRad # 161 - 0747 ) with 2 - mercaptoethanol ( ThermoFisher # BP176 ) was added to the samples , which were then heated to 95 °C for 5 minutes . Samples were run on 4 - 20 % Mini - PROTEAN pre - cast gels ( Biorad ) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( ThermoFisher # 88018 ) . Once membranes were blocked with 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA; Equitech - Bio BAH65 - 0500 ) in Tris buffered saline ( TBS ) with 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ( TBST; ThermoFisher BP337 ) for 1 hour at room temperature , they were incu - bated in primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C ( Table S2 ) . Membranes were washed with TBST and probed with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase ( Table S2 ) . Once they were washed again , bands were detected through enhanced chemiluminescence using freshly pre - pared substrate solution based on 100 mM Tris ( ThermoFisher BP152 ) ad - justed to pH 8 . 5 with hydrochloric acid ( ThermoFisher A144S - 212 ) , 1 . 2 mM luminol ( Sigma A8511 ) , 2 . 5 mM p - coumaric acid ( Sigma C9008 ) and 0 . 04 % hydrogen peroxide ( w / v , Alpha Aesar L14000 ) on a Syngene G : BOX im - ager equipped with a Synoptics 4 . 2 - megapixel camera and controlled with Syngene Genesys software . Quantitative reverse transcription PCR Keratinocytes were grown to confluence in 6 - well tissue culture plates . For comparison between cell lines ( Figure S1D ) , medium was switched from K - SFM to differentiation medium 24 hours before sample collection . For scratch wound experiments ( Figure 2C ) , culture medium was switched from K - SFM to differentiation medium , then treatment samples were scratched with a 1000 mL pipette tip in a cross - hatch pattern . The scratch proce - dure was repeated every other day for 10 days . Samples were collected one day following the last scratch procedure . RNA was isolated from the samples using RNeasy spin column kits ( Qiagen # 74004 ) and reverse tran - scription was performed using SuperScript IV First - Strand Synthesis Sys - tem with oligo ( dT ) 20 primers ( Invitrogen # 18091050 ) . Real - time PCR using a C1000 thermal cycler with a CFX96 optical reaction module ( Bio - Rad ) , iTaq Universal SYBER Green Supermix ( Bio - Rad ) , and transcript - specific primers ( Table S1 ) was performed to quantify transcript levels . The 2 −ΔΔCT method 12 was used to compare each individual keratin to the mean level of all keratins measured . Keratinocyte monolayer fragmentation assay We adopted the commonly used dispase - based fragmentation assay to verify the ability of our keratinocyte cell lines to form stable monolayer barriers 13 . Keratinocytes were seeded into collagen - coated 12 - well tissue culture plates and grown to confluence . Upon reaching confluence , culture medium was changed from K - SFM to differentiation medium with additional 0 . 5 mM calcium chloride . After an additional 48 - hour incubation , the mono - layers were washed twice with PBS then incubated in dispase solution ( 5 Nanes et al . | Keratin isoforms modulate motility signals | 15 units / mL in HBSS , Stemcell Technologies # 07913 ) for 80 minutes at 37 °C to detach the monolayers from the plate . The detached monolayers were then exposed to mechanical shear stress by slow passage through a 1000μL pipette tip 10 times . Each plate was then imaged twice with an Ap - ple iPhone 13 mini with gentle rocking between the image pairs to displace the monolayer fragments . Monolayer fragments were manually annotated and counted . If a different number of fragments was counted in each of the image pairs for a given well , the higher value was used . Electron microscopy Glow - discharged carbon - film gold EM grids ( EMS CF200 - Au ) were coated with bovine type I collagen ( PureCol , Advanced Biomatrix # 5005 ) by adding one drop of a 100 μg / mL collagen solution to each grid and incubating at 37 °C for 30 minutes . The collagen solution was then removed by absorption onto a strip of filter paper . Keratinocyte cell suspensions were prepared with 10 4 cells / mL in differentiation medium , and one drop of cell suspen - sion was added to each grid . After 24 hours , the grids were processed as follows 14 : grids were washed by dipping into 4 droplets of ‘cytoskeleton buffer’ ( CB ) 15 , after wicking off the last droplet , the grids were lightly fixed and extracted in CB containing 0 . 25 % glutaraldehyde and 0 . 5 % Triton - X 100 for 1 minute . Grids were washed by dipping into 1 droplet of CB . The grids were then fixed for 10 minutes in CB containing 2 % glutaraldehyde . After washing in 3 water droplets for 2 minutes each , the grids were stained with 1 % uranyl acetate for 2 minutes; washed twice in water droplets for 2 minutes each , then air dried . Imaging was done on a JEM - 1400 Plus transmission electron microscope equipped with a LaB6 source operated at 120 kV using an AMT - BioSprint 16M CCD camera . Cell junction widths were measured using ImageJ by manually drawing line regions of interest across the thickest portion of electron - dense intercellular bridges parallel to the cell - cell border . Live imaging of monolayer migration Sorted or mixed populations of keratinocytes were prepared depending on the experiment and seeded into collagen - coated 6 - well tissue culture plates . Cells were grown to confluence , then the culture medium was changed from K - SFM to differentiation medium . After 24 hours , a lin - ear scratch was created in each monolayer using a 1000 μL pipette tip . Monolayers were washed three times with PBS , which was then replaced with fresh differentiation medium . Samples were imaged using an in - verted phase - contrast and epifluorescence Nikon ECLIPSE Ti microscope equipped with a motorized and programmable stage , a Nikon Perfect Focus System , a Hamamatsu Orca - Flash4 . 0 scientific CMOS camera , a SOLA solid state white - light excitation system , an OKO lab custom - built environ - mental chamber with temperature control and CO2 stage incubator , and Nikon Elements acquisition software . The environment was maintained at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 during the imaging period . Beginning 30 minutes after wounding , phase - contrast and fluorescence images were acquired every 6 minutes using a Plan Fluor 10× 0 . 3NA objective . Analysis of migration images was based on a previously established computer vision pipeline for migration velocity estimation and wound edge detection 16 . In brief , velocity measurements were computed from the phase - contrast images using a particle image velocimetry ( PIV ) - based method with a 15 - μm square patch size . The pipeline includes a correction for possible microscope stage drift . Monolayer contours were then deter - mined by segmentation of the velocity map , based on the intuition that while the cells are moving , there should be no motion in the empty wound area . The algorithm imposes two additional constraints to increase robustness of the segmentation . First , the monolayer is assumed to be a continuous region . Second , the monolayer contour is assumed to move monotonically in one direction . The second condition means that the pipeline will fail if the monolayer edge retracts . Monolayers where this occurred were excluded from the analysis . While the pipeline is robust to the presence of stationary debris or irregularities in the surface of the wound area , floating debris may interfere with velocity estimation and identification of the monolayer con - tour . Therefore , images with floating debris were also excluded from the analysis . Downstream analysis steps were performed using custom MATLAB scripts . For uniform cell populations , two measures of migration were cal - culated . First , local migration speed , as estimated by particle image ve - locimetry , was averaged over an area between 10 - μm and 200 - μm from the monolayer contour . Because the monolayer contour as estimated from 15 - μm PIV patches is necessarily imprecise , the 10 - μm closest to the mono - layer contour was excluded . Average local migration speed followed a con - sistent pattern , quickly increasing to a peak speed , then gradually declining over the course of the experiment ( Figures S2B and 4C ) . However , the tim - ing of this peak varied between individual scratch wounds . For more robust comparisons , migration speeds traces were aligned in time based on the time of peak migration speed for each wound . Second , area closed was calculated based on advancement of the monolayer contour . This measure was not adjusted for differences in timing of peak migration speed . For mixed cell populations , monolayers were additionally segmented into regions with different keratin expression patterns . To accomplish this , each of the fluorescence images corresponding to tagged keratins were segmented using the Rosin thresholding method 17 . These masks were then used to define high and low expression regions for each keratin . Av - erage local migration speeds were calculated separately for each keratin expression region in the 10 - μm to 200 - μm band from the monolayer con - tour , as well as for the band as a whole . As with the analysis for uniform cell populations , migration speed traces were aligned in time based on the time of peak migration speed . Since area closed is an overall measure that does not allow comparisons between different keratin expression regions , it was not considered in analysis of the mixed population monolayers . Fixed imaging of monolayer migration Sorted or mixed populations of keratinocytes were prepared and seeded onto collagen - coated 18 mm - diameter # 1 . 5 coverslips in tissue culture dishes . After cells were grown to confluence , the culture medium was switched from K - SFM to differentiation medium . After 4 hours , a line scratch was created in each coverslip using a 1000 μL pipette tip . The cultures were then returned to the incubator for 24 hours to allow migration to occur . After that period , coverslips were removed from the incubator , washed 3 times with PBS , incubated in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences # 15713 ) in PBS for 10 minutes , incubated in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 8 minutes , and washed 3 more times with PBS . For experiments involving immunofluorescence labeling , samples were incu - bated in primary antibody diluted in PBS for 30 minutes at 37 °C ( Table S2 ) , washed 3 times with PBS , incubated in fluorophore - conjugated secondary antibody diluted in PBS for 30 minutes at 37 °C ( Table S2 ) , and washed 3 more times with PBS . Finally , coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Fluoromount - G with DAPI ( ThermoFisher 00 - 4959 - 52 ) . For analysis of relative enrichment of cells from a mixed population with different keratin expression levels at the monolayer edge ( Figure S2E ) , slides were imaged using an inverted epifluorescence Nikon ECLIPSE Ti microscope equipped with a Zyla sCMOS camera ( Andor ) , SOLA solid state white - light excitation system , and μManager acquisition software 18 . Partially overlapping images were acquired using a Plan Fluor 40× 1 . 3NA objective , then stitched together pairwise using the Fiji Image Stitching Plugin 19 . Analysis was performed on the composite stitched images . Monolayer edges were manually segmented using ImageJ . Individual cells were segmented using Cellpose version 1 . 0 with the pretrained “cyto” model 20 . A normalized sum of the tagged keratin fluorescence signals was used as input for the cytoplasm channel , and DAPI signal was used as in - put for the nuclear channel . Segmentations were manually reviewed , and any image areas with grossly incorrect cell segmentations were excluded from analysis . A custom Python script was used for downstream analysis . The median tagged keratin fluorescence signal was calculated for each cell . Cells were annotated as expressing high or low levels of each keratin using a linear discriminator function developed based on thresholds set between bimodal peaks in the fluorescence signal distributions . The fraction of cells expressing a high level of each keratin was then compared between the first 100 - μm from the monolayer edge and the next 400 - μm . For immunofluorescence imaging of endogenous keratin expression in migrating monolayers ( Figure 2A - B ) , slides were imaged using an inverted epifluorescence Nikon ECLIPSE Ti microscope equipped with a Zyla sC - MOS camera ( Andor ) , SOLA solid state white - light excitation system , and μManager acquisition software 18 . Images were acquired using Plan Apo 20× 0 . 75NA and Plan Apo 40× 1 . 3NA objectives . For immunofluorescence imaging of vimentin expression ( Figure S6 ) , slides were imaged using an in - verted phase - contrast and epifluorescence Nikon ECLIPSE Ti microscope equipped with a motorized and programmable stage , a Nikon Perfect Focus System , a Hamamatsu Orca - Flash4 . 0 scientific CMOS camera , a SOLA solid state white - light excitation system , an OKO lab custom - built environ - mental chamber with temperature control and CO2 stage incubator , and Nikon Elements acquisition software . Images were acquired using a Plan Apo 60× 1 . 4NA objective . Nanes et al . | Keratin isoforms modulate motility signals | 16 Live imaging of single - cell migration Keratinocytes were sparsely seeded onto collagen - coated # 1 . 5 glass - bottom culture dishes ( Cellvis D35 - 20 - 1 . 5 - N ) . Cells were imaged using an inverted phase - contrast and epifluorescence Nikon ECLIPSE Ti micro - scope equipped with a motorized and programmable stage , a Nikon Per - fect Focus System , a Hamamatsu Orca - Flash4 . 0 scientific CMOS camera , a SOLA solid state white - light excitation system , an OKO lab custom - built environmental chamber with temperature control and CO2 stage incuba - tor , and Nikon Elements acquisition software . The environment was main - tained at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 during the imaging period . Beginning 22 - minutes , 35 - minutes , or 6 - hours after seeding , fluorescence images were acquired every 3 minutes for 6 to 18 - hours using a Plan Fluor 10× 0 . 3NA objective . Images were analyzed using the TrackMate plugin for Fiji 21 . Cells were identified using the Laplacian of Gaussian detector , and tracks were iden - tified using the sparse linear assignment problem tracker 22 . Downstream analysis was performed using custom R scripts . Two complementary mea - sures of migration speed were considered . First , mean velocity of a track was defined as the length of the track divided by the track duration . Sec - ond , mean squared displacement ( MSD ) rate was defined as the square of track displacement ( linear distance from start to end positions ) divided by the track duration , averaged over the set of tracks . For freely diffusing particles , MSD increases linearly with time at a rate proportional to the dif - fusion coefficient 23 . Since sparsely seeded cells migrating in the absence of a directional que do not fully resemble freely diffusing particles , we do not estimate a diffusion coefficient , and instead use the MSD rate as an approximation to aggregate information from multiple tracks of potentially different lengths . Stratified epidermal migration model We adapted an epidermal culture model from existing protocols 24 , 25 . While epidermal equivalent cultures lack the fibroblast - containing dermal equiva - lent present in skin equivalent cultures 5 , their simplified design allowed us to prepare them in removable barrier molds to model epidermal migration . To prepare epidermal cultures , polycarbonate filters with 0 . 4μm pore size ( 3 . 14cm 2 area , Nunc # 140640 ) were placed in larger tissue culture dishes . Two silicone inserts , each with two chambers separated by a 500μm gap ( Ibidi # 80209 ) , were then pressed firmly into place on each filter using ster - ile forceps . On day 0 , a cell suspension of 2 . 5×10 5 keratinocytes in 70μL of K - SFM was added into each chamber , and additional K - SFM was added to the cul - ture dish to reach the level of the filter . Throughout the procedure , medium in the culture dish was refreshed every two to three days , and we verified that culture medium did not leak to the top surface of the filter outside of the silicone inserts . On day 3 , culture medium was aspirated from above the filter within the silicone inserts , effectively lifting the epidermal culture to an air - liquid interface . At the same time , medium in the culture dish was changed from K - SFM to differentiation medium . On day 7 , an additional 0 . 5 mM calcium chloride was added to the differentiation medium in the culture dish . For migration experiments , the silicone inserts were removed on day 9 by grasping the insert and filter housing with sterile forceps and gently lifting the insert while holding the filter in place . The filter was then returned to the culture dish , maintaining epidermal cultures at an air - liquid interface during the migration period . This time point , 6 days after exposure of the culture to an air - liquid interface , corresponded with development of clear basal and suprabasal keratinocyte layers and an early cornified layer , but precedes the formation of a thick cornified layer , which was more easily disrupted during removal of the silicone inserts ( Figure 2D ) . Cultures were either imaged live during migration or fixed at the appropriate timepoint . Fixation , staining , and imaging of epidermal cultures Prior to fixation , medium was aspirated from the tissue culture dish and the top and bottom surfaces of the filters were washed twice with PBS , taking care not to dislodge the epidermal cultures from the top surface of the fil - ters . The filters were then removed from the culture dishes and incubated overnight in 4 % paraformaldehyde solution at 4 °C ( Electron Microscopy Sciences # 15713 ) . In preparation for paraffin embedding and sectioning , the filters were cut out from their plastic housing using a # 15 scalpel blade ( GF Health Products 2976 # 15 ) , bisected perpendicularly to the migration edge , and embedded in a 2 . 5 % agarose gel ( Lonza SeaKem LE Agarose # 50000 ) . Samples were submitted to the UT Southwestern Histo Pathol - ogy Core Facility for paraffin embedding , sectioning , and preparation of hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) stained and unstained slides . In preparation for immunofluorescence staining , unstained paraffin - embedded tissue sections on glass slides were deparaffinized by 3 suc - cessive 5 - minute incubations in xylene followed by rehydration in 3 suc - cessive 3 - minute incubations in 100 % ethanol and 2 successive 2 - minute incubations in deionized water . For antigen retrieval , slides were placed in Tris - EDTA buffer ( 10 mM Tris base , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , pH 9 ) , heated to 95 °C in a microwave oven , and incubated until the buffer cooled to room temperature , approximately 45 minutes . Slides were rinsed three times in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution ( HBSS ) for 5 minutes each , and a PAP pen was used to circle the tissue sections . Slides were then incubated in blocking solution [ 5 % goat serum ( Abcam ab7481 ) , 5 % bovine serum al - bumin ( Equitech - Bio BAH65 - 0500 ) , and 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma X100 ) in PBS ] for 1 hour . Primary antibodies ( Table S2 ) were diluted in PBS and incubated on the tissue sections overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber . Following primary antibody incubation , slides were washed 3 times with HBSS for 10 minutes each . Secondary antibodies ( Table S2 ) were diluted in PBS and incubated on the tissue sections for 60 minutes . Finally , the slides were washed 3 times with HBSS for 10 minutes each , and a small amount of Fluoromount - G with DAPI ( ThermoFisher 00 - 4959 - 52 ) was used to affix coverslips to the slides . H & E slides were imaged using an Olympus BX53 upright microscope with brightfield illumination , an Olympus DP21 2 . 01 megapixel color CCD camera , and Plan N 4× 0 . 1NA , 10× 0 . 25NA , 20× 0 . 4NA , and 40× 0 . 65NA objectives . For migration assays , the gap width between epidermal culture pairs was measured using ImageJ by manually drawing polyline regions of interest along the filter in the gap . Immunofluorescence slides were imaged using an inverted epifluorescence Nikon ECLIPSE Ti microscope equipped with a Zyla sCMOS camera ( Andor ) , SOLA solid state white - light excitation system , and μManager acquisition software 18 . Partially overlapping im - ages were acquired using a Plan Fluor 40× 1 . 3NA objective , then stitched together pairwise using the Fiji Image Stitching Plugin 19 . Live imaging of epidermal culture migration Epidermal cultures were imaged using an inverted phase - contrast and epi - fluorescence Nikon ECLIPSE Ti microscope equipped with a motorized and programmable stage , a Nikon Perfect Focus System , a Hamamatsu Orca - Flash4 . 0 scientific CMOS camera , a SOLA solid state white - light excitation system , an OKO lab custom - built environmental chamber with temperature control and CO2 stage incubator , and Nikon Elements acquisition software . With epidermal cultures on filters sitting in tissue culture dishes placed on the stage of the inverted microscope , images were acquired from below , through the semi - translucent filter ( Figure 3H ) . The environment was main - tained at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 during the imaging period . Beginning 15 min - utes after barrier removal , fluorescence images were acquired every 12 minutes using a Plan Fluor 10× 0 . 3NA objective . Although resolution was limited by imaging through the filters , bright flu - orescence signals from the tagged keratin constructs allowed us to identify cell locations . To analyze the resulting fluorescence images , we modified the monolayer migration analysis pipeline described above 16 as follows : First , all images were smoothed using a Gaussian filter with a 3 . 25 - μm ( 5 pixel ) standard deviation to decrease the influence of the filter mesh pattern on the PIV calculations . Second , since the initial texture - based segmentation seed frequently failed with fluorescence images instead of phase - contrast images , we used Otsu thresholding as an alternative 26 . Fi - nally , because interpretation of the PIV - based local velocity estimates was complicated by potential differences in cell motion at different vertical lev - els within the three - dimensional epidermal culture , migration distance and speed calculations were based only on the distance travelled by the mono - layer contour . Keratin filament network segmentation and analysis Keratinocyte cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged keratins were seeded onto collagen - coated # 1 . 5 glass - bottom culture dishes ( Cellvis D35 - 20 - 1 . 5 - N ) . For knockdown experiments , cells were transduced with lentivirus to express targeting shRNA ( Table S1 ) or a scrambled control 72 hours before analysis . Once cells grew to discrete colonies , but be - fore reaching confluence , the culture medium was switched from K - SFM to differentiation medium . After 8 hours , cells were imaged using an in - verted phase - contrast and epifluorescence Nikon ECLIPSE Ti microscope equipped with a motorized and programmable stage , a Nikon Perfect Focus System , a Hamamatsu Orca - Flash4 . 0 scientific CMOS camera , a SOLA solid state white - light excitation system , an OKO lab custom - built environ - mental chamber with temperature control and CO2 stage incubator , and Nanes et al . | Keratin isoforms modulate motility signals | 17 Nikon Elements acquisition software . The environment was maintained at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 during the imaging period . Images were acquired every 1 minute for 4 minutes using a Plan Apo 60× 1 . 4NA objective , generating an effective pixel size in object space of 108 nm . For applicable experiments , 30 μM blebbistatin ( Sigma B0560 ) , 5 μM Y27632 ( Selleckchem S1049 ) , 1 μM GSK 269962A ( Selleckchem S7687 ) , or DMSO ( Fisher BP231 ) con - trol were added 1 hour ( blebbistatin ) or 2 hours ( other inhibitors ) prior to imaging . Images were analyzed using the previously published Filament Network Analysis package written in MATLAB 27 . In brief , the pipeline segments the filament network using a multi - scale steerable filter and iterative graph matching to connect fragments into complete filaments . The pipeline also calculates the local structural similarity of two filament networks based on the distance and orientation of individual filament pixels in the networks . Each pixel in the first network is matched to the closest pixel in the second network within a defined radius , and vice versa . A radius of 2 . 2 μm was used for all studies here . For each matched pair , the difference in position and filament orientation are calculated and used to create distance and angle maps , which are spatially smoothed by a Gaussian filter , combined , and scaled so the final similarity score decreases monotonically from 1 to 0 as the distance increases to the search radius or the angle increases to π / 3 . The dynamics score is defined as 1 minus the combined similarity score . The final dynamics score is 0 for identical networks and increases to 1 with increasing local differences in filament position or orientation . To measure the effect of keratin filament composition on filament net - work dynamics within cells , the keratin filament images at baseline were compared to images 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 minutes later ( Figure 5A ) . Because this analysis cannot reliably distinguish movement of filaments within cells from movement of the cells themselves , all image sequences were pre - screened to ensure that only stationary cells were included in the analysis . Cells were manually segmented using ImageJ , and the Filament Network Analy - sis Package was run to segment the keratin filament networks and calculate dynamics score maps ( Figure 5B - D ) . The dynamics score map was then averaged over each cell area mask , excluding regions without a filament match . As a check , a quality score was computed for each cell , defined as the fraction of the cell mask area with a filament match , which was typically higher than 0 . 9 . Image sequences of cells with low quality scores were reviewed by visual inspection . They tended to show failed filament seg - mentation due to low signal - to - noise ratio , debris , or cell movement , which was missed in the initial screen; these cells were excluded from subsequent analysis . For the filament dynamics analysis of keratinocytes expressing different levels of multiple keratins , the quality score on each channel also served as a robust marker of high versus low expression of each keratin , with clear bimodal distributions ( Figure S3I ) . In addition to the dynamics score , the Filament Network Analysis pack - age was used to calculate additional keratin filament network properties from the baseline keratin filament segmentation . Filament density was de - fined as the fraction of cell area pixels segmented as filaments . Filament straightness was defined as the ratio of the linear start to end distance to the filament length . Filament curvature was defined as the mean curvature of a polynomial fit at each pixel along the filament . The median filament length , straightness , and curvature were calculated for each cell . An alter - nate cell summary measure of filament curvature was also calculated as the median curvature of each pixel in all filaments in the cell . Traction force microscopy Silicone gel substrates for traction force microscopy ( TFM ) were prepared in # 1 . 0 glass - bottom 35 - mm tissue culture dishes ( Cellvis D35 - 14 - 1 . 0 - N ) . Prepolymers for high - refractive index ( n = 1 . 49 ) 8 - kPa gels were prepared by mixing components A and B of QGel 920 ( Quantum Silicones ) in a 1 : 1 . 15 ratio as previously described 28 , 29 . The prepolymers were spread onto the coverglass bottoms of the dishes by spinning at 1 , 250 r . p . m for 30 seconds in a spin - coater ( Laurell Technologies WS - 650Mz - 23NPPB ) , then cured at 100 °C for 2 hours , producing gels approximately 35 - μm thick . The gels were then treated with 5 % ( 3 - aminopropyl ) triethoxysilane ( APTES ) in ethanol to functionalize their surfaces . To allow for visualization and track - ing of substrate deformation , 40 - nm carboxylate far - red fluorescent beads were covalently linked to the gel surfaces by incubating the gels under a suspension of the beads ( 1 : 5 , 000 dilution from the 5 % stock suspension ) in 40 - mM HEPES , pH 8 , with 0 . 01 % 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) car - bodiimide ( EDC ) as a catalyst . To facilitate cell adhesion during cell seed - ing , the substrates were coated with fibronectin by incubation with 50 - μg / ml of fibronectin and 1 mg / ml EDC in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature . The coated dishes were washed three times with PBS and filled with cell culture medium before cell seeding . To measure keratinocyte traction force generation , 4×10 4 cells were seeded onto a substrate in differentiation medium , then returned to the in - cubator for 4 . 5 hours to allow attachment to occur . For knockdown exper - iments , cells were transduced with lentivirus to express targeting shRNA or a scrambled control 72 hours before seeding onto TFM substrates . Fol - lowing attachment , cells were imaged using a GE DeltaVision OMX SR inverted microscope equipped with a motorized and programmable stage , three PCO sCMOS cameras , solid state lasers ( 405nm , 488nm , 568nm , and 640nm ) , and environment control . Images of the substrate beads and keratin tags were acquired in Ring - TIRF mode with a U Plan Apo 60× 1 . 49NA objective ( generating an effective pixel size in object space of 80 nm ) , with imaging performed at 37 °C . Following initial imaging , during which cell positions were recorded , a prewarmed solution of dilute bleach was added to remove cells from the substrate , thereby allowing repeat imaging of the same locations with the substrate in its relaxed , strain - free state . Image analysis was performed using the previously published TFM package written in MATLAB 29 , 30 . Briefly , the substrate deformation field was determined by tracking the displacement of each bead between the deformed and relaxed images using cross - correlation analysis . The dis - placement field , after outlier removal and stage drift correction , was then used to estimate the traction field over areas of interest surrounding each cell . Traction fields were estimated using the boundary element method 29 . While more computationally intensive than the more commonly used Fourier transform traction cytometry method , the boundary element method allows L1 - norm rather than L2 - norm regularization , which resolves force variation at shorter length scales 29 . A regularization parameter of 0 . 05 was selected based on L - curve analysis of a subset of images 29 . This param - eter value was applied to all images analyzed to permit comparison of the resulting force fields . Cell area was segmented based on the tagged keratin signal . Since this signal did not always clearly extend to the cell boundary ( for example , Figure 6A ) , masks were dilated by 1 . 6 μm ( 20 pixels ) , al - though we verified that the precise amount of dilation did not meaningfully affect the results ( Figure S4C ) . Strain energy , which represents the me - chanical work of the cell on the elastic substrate , was calculated as ½ × ( displacement ꞏ traction ) , integrated over the segmented cell area 31 . Proximity ligation assay Mixed populations of keratinocytes were prepared and seeded onto 8 - chamber glass slides with removable wells ( Lab - Tek , ThermoFisher # 154534 ) . Cells were grown to approximately 50 % confluence , then cul - ture medium was switched from K - SFM to differentiation medium for 24 hours . For knockdown experiments , cells were transduced with lentivirus to express targeting shRNA ( Table S1 ) or a scrambled control 72 hours before processing . Slides were removed from the incubator and washed three times with PBS . For experiments using antibodies against keratins , the slides were incubated in methanol for 2 minutes . For other experiments , the slides were incubated in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes , then incubated in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 8 minutes . Slides were then washed twice with PBS and processed using Duolink Proximity Liga - tion Assay ( PLA ) reagents ( In - Situ PLA Probe Anti - Mouse MINUS , Sigma DUO92004; In - Situ PLA Probe Anti - Rabbit PLUS , Sigma DUO92002; In - Situ Detection Reagents FarRed , Sigma DUO92013 ) according to the man - ufacturer’s in situ fluorescence protocol . Briefly , slides were incubated in theprovidedBlockingSolutionfor60minutes , incubatedinprimaryantibod - ies diluted in the provided Antibody Dilutant solution for 30 minutes ( Table S2 ) , incubated in PLA probe solution for 60 minutes , incubated in the lig - ation solution for 30 minutes , and incubated in the amplification solution for 100 minutes , with washes in the provided buffers between each step . Finally , a # 1 . 5 cover glass was affixed to the slide using Duolink In - Situ Mounting Medium with DAPI ( Sigma DUO82040 ) . Slides were imaged using an inverted phase - contrast and epifluores - cence Nikon ECLIPSE Ti microscope equipped with a motorized and pro - grammable stage , a Nikon Perfect Focus System , a Hamamatsu Orca - Flash4 . 0 scientific CMOS camera , a SOLA solid state white - light excitation system , an OKO lab custom - built environmental chamber with temperature control and CO2 stage incubator , and Nikon Elements acquisition software . Images were acquired on the tagged keratin , PLA reaction , and DAPI chan - nels using a Plan Apo 60× 1 . 4NA objective ( generating an effective pixel size in object space of 110 nm ) . Image analysis was performed using cus - tom Python and MATLAB scripts . Individual cells were segmented using Nanes et al . | Keratin isoforms modulate motility signals | 18 Cellpose version 1 . 0 with the pretrained “cyto” model 20 . A normalized sum of the tagged keratin fluorescence signals was used as input for the cyto - plasm channel , and DAPI signal was used as input for the nuclear channel . The median tagged keratin fluorescence signal was calculated for each cell . Cells were annotated as expressing high or low levels of each keratin using an empiric linear discriminator function developed based on review of the distribution of median signals . Segmentations and classifications were manually reviewed , and any incorrectly segmented or classified cells were excluded from analysis . Cells that were poorly adhered to the slide or out of focus were also excluded . Next , individual local intensity clusters in the scaled PLA image were detected using previously published MAT - LAB code combining wavelet denoising and multiscale products of wavelet coefficients 32 , 33 . Finally , PLA detections were counted within each seg - mented cell mask , and the density of PLA detections was compared be - tween cells with different keratin expression levels . Proximity biotin labeling screen Keratinocytes were transduced with lentivirus to express K5 or K6A linked to a small promiscuous biotin ligase 8 . Because these constructs lack a se - lection marker , a mixed - population lentivirus was prepared by combining the tagged keratin constructs with an EGFP marker construct ( see “Plas - mids , ” above ) at a molar ratio of 100 : 1 . Cells were selected by fluorescence activated cell sorting as described above . Each cell line was then grown to confluence in collagen - coated 10 cm tissue culture plates and switched from K - SFM to differentiation medium for 24 hours before beginning the experiment . Two independent experimental replicates were performed . Cells were incubated with 100 µM biotin for 1 hour and lysed in JS buffer ( 50 mM Tris HClpH7 . 5 , 150mMNaCl , 5mMEGTA , 1 . 5mMMgCl 2 , 1 % Glyceroland1 % Triton X - 100 ) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor , Thermo ) . Cleared lysates were incu - bated with Protein A Sepharose beads to remove proteins with nonspecific binding to the beads . The resulting supernatant ( 1 mg ) was incubated with 100 µl of streptavidin - coated magnetic beads ( Dynabeads MyOne Strepta - vidin T1 beads , Invitrogen ) overnight at 4 °C with rotation to enrich for bi - otinylated proteins . Beads were washed three times with ice - cold JS buffer and in - gel digested for Mass Spectrometry analysis . Proteomics data was analyzed using the DEP package for differen - tial enrichment analysis of proteomics data in R 34 . Only proteins with no missing values in at least one of the two cell lines were included in the analysis . Abundance data was background - corrected and normalized by variance stabilizing transformation 35 , and any remaining missing values were imputed as draws from a Gaussian distribution centered on quan - tile 0 . 005 of the observed values with standard deviation equal to the me - dian standard deviation of the observed values 36 . Differential enrichment was estimated based on protein - wise linear models and empirical Bayes statistics 37 , and local false discovery rates were estimated using the fdrtool package 38 , 39 . Functional analysis was then performed using the cluster - Profiler package 40 . We searched for overrepresentation of proteins with at least 3 - fold enrichment and adjusted P < . 05 in the Gene Ontology Biolog - ical Process annotation set 41 , 42 using Fisher’s exact test , with adjustment for multiple comparisons 43 . Because the small size of the screen limited our statistical power , we restricted our search to high - level labels with be - tween 750 and 5 , 000 annotated genes . Analysis of cell - cell junction density Cells were prepared and seeded onto collagen - coated 18 - mm - diameter # 1 . 5 coverslips in tissue culture dishes . After reaching 25 % confluence , the culture medium was switched from K - SFM to differentiation medium . Af - ter 5 hours , coverslips were removed from the incubator , washed 3 times with PBS , incubated in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sci - ences # 15713 ) in PBS for 10 minutes , incubated in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 8 minutes , and washed 3 more times with PBS . Coverslips were then incubated in either Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin ( ThermoFisher A12379 ) or Alexa Fluor 555 phalloidin ( ThermoFisher A34055 ) diluted 1 : 400 in PBS for 30 minutes at 37 °C . Finally , coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Fluoromount - G with DAPI ( ThermoFisher 00 - 4959 - 52 ) . Slides were imaged using an inverted Nikon Ti - Eclipse microscope equipped with a pco . edge sCMOS camera with 6 . 5 - μm pixel size ( PCO ) , an Andor Diskovery illuminator coupled to a Yokogawa CSU - X1 confocal spinning disk head with 100 nm pinholes , and an Apo TIRF 60× 1 . 49NA objective ( Nikon ) with an additional 1 . 8× tube lens ( yielding a final mag - nification of 108×; Andor Technology ) . This setup generated an effec - tive pixel size in object space of 120 nm . Actin and keratin filament net - works were segmented using the Filament Network Analysis package as described above in the section “Keratin filament network segmentation and analysis” based on images of phalloidin and tagged keratins respectively 27 . Approximate cell - cell boundaries were manually annotated using ImageJ . Adherens junctions and desmosomes , defined as segmented actin and ker - atin filaments crossing annotated cell - cell boundaries , were counted using the SlideSet plugin with a custom analysis plugin written in Java 44 . Junction density was defined as the number of junctions detected along a cell - cell boundary divided by the length of the boundary . To account for potential inconsistency in the start and end positions of the manually annotated cell - cell boundaries , boundary length was trimmed by the outermost junctions . Junction density was then compared between cell lines with different ker - atin expression levels . Cell death assay Cells were prepared and 5 . 5×10 4 cells were seeded onto collagen - coated 35 - mm # 1 . 5 glass - bottom culture dishes ( Cellvis D35 - 20 - 1 . 5 - N ) . After 4 hours of incubation , cells were transduced with lentivirus to express target - ing shRNA or a scrambled control . Cells were cultured with shRNA expres - sion for 120 hours with regular culture medium changes . H2B - mCherry3 co - expression from the shRNA constructs allowed us to confirm an infec - tion efficiency close to 100 % ( see “Plasmids” above ) . Following the growth period , cells were incubated in SYTOX Deep Red Nucleic Acid Stain dis - solved in K - SFM ( 0 . 5 μM final concentration; ThermoFisher S11381 ) for 30 minutes at 37 °C , then washed twice with PBS . Cells were imaged us - ing an inverted epifluorescence Nikon ECLIPSE Ti microscope equipped with a motorized and programmable stage , a Nikon Perfect Focus Sys - tem , a Hamamatsu Orca - Flash4 . 0 scientific CMOS camera , a SOLA solid state white - light excitation system , an OKO lab custom - built environmental chamber with temperature control and CO2 stage incubator , and Nikon El - ements acquisition software . Images of the SYTOX dye , tagged keratins , and tagged H2B were acquired with a Plan Apo 60× 1 . 4NA objective , gen - erating an effective pixel size in object space of 108 nm . Individual cells were segmented using Cellpose version 1 . 0 with the pre - trained “cyto” model 20 . First , the tagged keratin fluorescence signal was used as input for the cytoplasm channel , and no input was provided for the nuclear channel . Second , the tagged H2B signal was used as input for the “cytoplasm” channel , and no input was provided for the “nuclear” channel . This produced whole cell and nuclear masks respectively . Segmentations were manually reviewed , and any image areas with grossly incorrect cell segmentations were excluded from analysis . A custom Python script was used for downstream analysis . The median SYTOX signal within the nu - clear mask was calculated for each whole cell mask . Cells were annotated as either SYTOX - negative ( live ) or SYTOX - positive ( dead ) based on com - parison of the median SYTOX signal to a threshold set between bimodal peaks in the SYTOX signal distribution . Cell proliferation assay Cells were prepared and seeded into collagen - coated 12 - well tissue culture plates , 4×10 4 cells per well . For knockdown experiments , cells were trans - duced with lentivirus to express targeting shRNA or a scrambled control after 4 hours , then analyzed after 96 hours with regular changes of cul - ture medium . H2B - mCherry3 co - expression from the shRNA constructs allowed us to confirm an infection efficiency close to 100 % ( see “Plas - mids” above ) . For direct cell line comparisons without shRNA knockdown , cells were analyzed after 4 days in standard culture conditions . Following the growth period , cells were incubated in 5 - ethynyl - 2’ - deoxyuridine ( EdU; ThermoFisher A10044 ) dissolved in K - SFM ( 20 mM final concentration ) for 60 minutes at 37 °C . Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS , in - cubated in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences # 15713 ) in PBS for 10 minutes , incubated in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 8 min - utes , and washed 3 more times with PBS . To detect EdU incorporation into nuclear DNA , cells were incubated in a reaction mixture containing 20 mg / mL L - ascorbic acid ( Sigma A92902 ) , 0 . 5 mg / mL anhydrous copper ( II ) sulfate ( Acros # 42287 ) , and 1 μM Cy5 - azide ( Sigma # 777323 ) in PBS for 30 minutes at 37 °C . Cells were washed 3 times with PBS , then incubated in DAPI ( ThermoFisher D1306 ) diluted 1 : 5 , 000 in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature to provide a nuclear counter - stain . After 3 final washes in PBS , cells were imaged using an inverted phase - contrast and epifluo - rescence Nikon ECLIPSE Ti microscope equipped with a motorized and programmable stage , a Nikon Perfect Focus System , a Hamamatsu Orca - Flash4 . 0 scientific CMOS camera , a SOLA solid state white - light excitation Nanes et al . | Keratin isoforms modulate motility signals | 19 system , an OKO lab custom - built environmental chamber with temperature control and CO2 stage incubator , and Nikon Elements acquisition software . DAPI and Cy5 images were acquired using a Plan Fluor 10× 0 . 3NA objec - tive , generating an effective pixel size in object space of 650 nm . Images were segmented using Cellpose version 1 . 0 with the pretrained “cyto” model 20 . The DAPI signal was used as input for the “cytoplasm” channel , and no input was provided for the “nuclear” channel , producing cell nucleus masks . The median Cy5 signal was calculated for each mask , and cells were annotated as EdU - positive ( Cy5 - high , proliferating ) or EdU - negative ( Cy5 - low , quiescent ) based on comparison of the median Cy5 sig - nal to a threshold set between bimodal peaks in the Cy5 signal distribution . Imaging of clinical wound samples Routine skin biopsies performed for diagnostic purposes result in epider - mal wounds , which typically heal over 2 to 6 weeks . If a malignant lesion is identified in the biopsy , an excision may be recommended to ensure that the malignancy is completely removed . If an excision is performed before the biopsy wound has completely healed , the resulting specimen will inci - dentally contain the re - epithelializing biopsy wound edges . We obtained anonymized H & E stained and unstained tissue sections from an excision specimen in which the re - epithelizing biopsy wound edges were visible , but no residual carcinoma was present . Unstained slides were processed for immunofluorescence and imaged using the procedures describe above in “Fixation , staining , and imaging of epidermal cultures . ” This study was approved by the UT Southwestern Institutional Review Board . Clinical sample transcriptomics analysis Two previously published transcriptomics datasets comparing wounded to intact skin were reanalyzed for keratin expression using custom R scripts . Iglesias - Bartolome and colleagues collected serial punch biopsy speci - mens from the arm and buccal mucosa , extracted RNA from the samples , and performed RNA sequencing 45 . Unwounded skin was represented by the initial samples , and wounded skin was represented by follow - up sam - ples taken from the same locations . We downloaded the expression data ( Gene Expression Omnibus GSE97615 ) for the arm skin samples and plot - ted keratin transcript levels ( log - transformed RPKM ) as a heatmap . Statis - tical analysis was not performed . Ramirez and colleagues collected tissue samples from diabetic foot ulcers and non - ulcerated foot skin , extracted RNA from the samples , and profiled transcripts using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 2 . 0 ST microarrays 46 , 47 . We downloaded the expression data ( Gene Expression Omnibus GSE80178 ) and used the “oligo” R pack - age to import , annotate , and preprocess the microarray data , including background - correction and normalization using the RMA algorithm 48 . Ker - atin expression intensity values for wound and control samples were plotted as a heatmap , and statistical analysis was not performed . Statistical analysis All statistical analysis was performed using R ( R Foundation for Statistical Computing ) . The Kruskal - Wallis rank sum test was used to evaluate non - parametric scaled data , with Dunn’s method for multiple comparisons used for experiments involving more than two groups 49 . Two - tailed P values less than 0 . 05 are considered to be significant , and are shown in figures or indicated in legends .
