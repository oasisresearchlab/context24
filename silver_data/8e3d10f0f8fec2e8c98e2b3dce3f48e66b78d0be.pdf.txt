Depletion of cellular cholesterol levels caused a reversible block of immature secretory granule biogenesis at the level of the trans - Golgi - network , whereas increased cholesterol levels pro - moted immature secretory granule formation . Choles - terol depletion also blocked the formation of constitutive secretory vesicles , but did not inhibit the transport be - tween the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex . Our results indicate that the assembly of cholesterol - based lipid microdomains is required for the biogenesis of both regulated and constitutive secretory vesicles from the trans - Golgi - network in neuroendocrine cells . Key words : Cholesterol , trans - Golgi network , secretory vesicles , membrane curvature , lipid rafts Received 28 August 2000 , revised and accepted for publi - cation 29 September 2000 Protein secretion is a common feature of virtually all eukary - otic cells . Certain cells such as neurons , endocrine and ex - ocrine cells secrete proteins not only via the ubiquitous constitutive pathway , but also in a stimulus - dependent man - ner via the regulated pathway ( 1 ) . Regulated secretory proteins ( RSPs ) , destined to the regulated pathway , are pack - aged at the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) into immature secre - tory granules ( ISGs ) , which mature to the secretory granules , the organelles mediating regulated protein secretion ( 2 – 6 ) . The assembly of ISGs involves several steps – cargo segre - gation , cargo - membrane recognition and selection of certain integral membrane constituents into the nascent secretory granule membrane – all of which are only partially under - stood . The segregation of regulated from constitutive secre - tory proteins is accomplished by the selective aggregation of regulated secretory proteins in the TGN ; this process is induced by the lumenal milieu of the TGN ( 7 ) and continues during maturation of ISGs ( 3 , 8 ) . Recognition between the secretory cargo and membrane constituents that enter the forming ISG is thought to involve speciﬁc structures on RSPs , often referred to as ‘sorting signals’ . Sorting signals have been identiﬁed for several RSPs ( 9 – 11 ) , but their inter - action partners and mechanism of action remain controver - sial ( 5 , 8 , 12 ) . The assembly of the ISG membrane also includes sorting processes . Analogous to the self - aggregation of the regu - lated secretory cargo , lateral self - organization of membrane constituents , induced by the phase separation of lipids that occurs in membranes rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids ( 13 ) , has been proposed to contribute to the formation of ISGs ( 14 ) . Such cholesterol - dependent organization of mem - branes into lipid rafts plays an important role in several pathways of membrane trafﬁc , including polarized secretion ( 15 , 16 ) and endocytosis ( 17 , 18 ) . In addition , a speciﬁc inter - action between cholesterol and a transmembrane protein ( synaptophysin ) was suggested to be essential for the gener - ation of synaptic vesicles at the plasma membrane ( 19 ) . As the formation of lipid rafts critically depends on choles - terol levels , raft - dependent membrane trafﬁc pathways can be discriminated from raft - independent pathways by their sensitivity to experimental reductions of cellular cholesterol levels ( 15 ) . In this study , we show that the biogenesis of secretory vesicles from the TGN , and RSP packaging into immature secretory granules , critically depend on the cellular cholesterol level . Cholesterol effects on the trafﬁc of RSPs are reversible and act speciﬁcally at the level of the TGN . Results Cholesteroldepletionreversiblyinhibitstheformation ofsecretoryvesiclesfromtheTGN We examined the consequences of altering cellular choles - terol levels on secretory granule biogenesis in the neuroen - docrine cell line AtT - 20 . AtT - 20 cells were grown in cholesterol - free medium in the presence of the inhibitor of endogenous cholesterol synthesis , Lovastatin ( 20 ) , followed by analysis of the endogenous RSP pro - opiomelanocoertin ( POMC ) . After 35 h of treatment with 10 m M Lovastatin , the cholesterol level relative to that of the phospholipids PC and PE was reduced to 50 % of the control value , i . e . the choles - terol level of AtT - 20 cells grown in medium supplemented with 15 % delipidated serum ( Table 1 ) .

The latter was identiﬁed by immunostaining for GLUMEN , a Golgi - resident 29 kDa transmembrane protein whose lumenal domain corresponds to NESP55 ( 21 ) and which is encoded by the XL2 exon of the XL a s gene ( 22 ) ( Y . Wang , R . Kehlenbach , M . J . Hannah and W . B . Huttner , unpublished data ) . Lovastatin treatment for 35 h resulted in ( i ) the accumulation of POMC immunoreactivity in the Golgi complex and ( ii ) the disappearance of secretory vesicles immunoreactive for POMC and : or processing prod - ucts derived therefrom ( Figure 1 , 35 h LS ) . This disappear - ance presumably reﬂected POMC secretion without concomitant replenishment of the secretory vesicle pool due to a block of secretory vesicle formation from the Golgi complex . Two observations demonstrated that the block of secretory vesicle formation from the Golgi complex upon Lovastatin treatment , which blocks the synthesis of all mevalonate - derived lipids , was due to a decrease in the level of cellular cholesterol rather than another lipid . First , no effect of Lovas - tatin was seen in AtT - 20 cells grown in non - delipidated medium ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the relevant mevalonate - derived lipid was present in serum . Second , the observed accumulation of POMC in the Golgi complex was readily reversed by addition of 0 . 25 mM cholesterol ( com - plexed to cyclodextrin ) in the continued presence of Lovas - tatin , in parallel with a replenishment of the cellular cholesterol level ( Table 1 ) . Punctate immunoreactive struc - tures in the vicinity of the Golgi complex , likely to represent newly formed secretory vesicles , were observed already 15 min after addition of cholesterol ( data not shown ) . Two hours after addition of cholesterol , the subcellular pattern of POMC immunoreactivity was similar to that of control cells , i . e . with immunoreactivity being observed in both the Golgi complex and secretory vesicles ( Figure 1 ; 37 h LS , 2 h CH ) . Four hours after addition of cholesterol ( Figure 1 ; 39 h LS , 4 h CH ) , the Golgi complex was largely cleared of POMC immunoreactiv - ity , which now was observed in secretory vesicles dis - tributed throughout the cytoplasm and concentrated in the tips of the cellular processes where secretory granules are known to accumulate ( 23 ) . Compared to control cells , less POMC immunoreactivity was retained in the Golgi complex after cholesterol readdition , suggesting that an elevated cellular cholesterol level might promote the packaging of secretory cargo at the TGN . Raisingthecellularcholesterollevelpromotes packagingofchromograninBintopost - Golgivesicles We next examined the effects of manipulating cholesterol levels on the subcellular distribution of chromogranin B ( CgB ) , an RSP found in a wide variety of endocrine cells and neurons ( 24 ) . In AtT - 20 cells grown in normal medium ( i . e . in the presence of 15 % non - delipidated serum ) , only some CgB immunoreactivity was found in punctate structures likely to be secretory granules , whereas the majority of CgB colocal - ized with the Golgi complex ( Figure 2 , control ) . The fact that the CgB - containing vesicle population appears to be smaller than the one containing POMC at least partially reﬂects a higher sorting efﬁciency of CgB relative to POMC . Incubation of AtT - 20 cells in the presence of cycloheximide ( to prevent replenishing the Golgi pool of CgB ) resulted in the clearance of CgB from the Golgi complex into secretory vesicles ( data not shown ) , demonstrating the transient nature of the accu - mulation of CgB in the Golgi complex . We explored the possibility that this transient accumulation was due to limit - ing levels of cholesterol , i . e . that addition of cholesterol might increase the packaging of CgB into TGN - derived vesi - cles . While little change in the subcellular distribution of CgB was observed 1 h after addition of 0 . 25 mM cholesterol ( complexed to cyclodextrin ) ( Figure 2 , 1 h ) , 2 h after choles - terol addition , the Golgi localization of CgB was shifted to an almost completely vesicular localization ( Figure 2 , 2 h ) , which often was concentrated in the tips of the cellular processes ( data not shown ) . We conclude that efﬁcient formation of secretory granules containing CgB strongly depends on an adequate cellular cholesterol level and that the AtT - 20 cells under the present growth conditions did not reach this level . We used electron microscopy to determine at which level within the Golgi complex secretory protein trafﬁc was af - fected by cholesterol depletion . AtT - 20 cells treated with Lovastatin in delipidated medium for 35 h ( Figure 3C (cid:27) C % ) showed a marked vacuolation of the TGN compared to con - trol cells ( Figure 3A (cid:27) A % , Table 2 ) , whereas the cisternae at the cis - face of the Golgi complex were unaffected . Fre - quently , the TGN vacuoles were found to contain electron - dense material , presumably condensed regulated secretory cargo , which usually was in contact with the membrane ( Figure 3D (cid:27) C % , asterisks ) . In the periphery of the cell , secre - tory granules were found to accumulate in control cells ( Figure 3B ) but not in cholesterol - depleted cells ( not shown ) , consistent with the lack of peripheral immunoreactive puncta in immunoﬂuorescence ( compare Figure 1 ) .

After ﬁxation , cells were immunostained for the Golgi marker GLUMEN ( green ) and POMC ( red ) . The pictures shown are composites of nine confocal sections encompassing the entire thickness of the cells to ensure that the Golgi complex and secretory vesicles , which are found in different horizontal planes , are equally represented in the pictures . Scale bar : 10 m m . the vacuolation of the TGN and lack of peripheral secretory granules , were found to be reversible upon treatment of cholesterol - depleted cells with cholesterol ( complexed to cy - clodextrin ) . Figure 3E and E % and Table 2 show the lack of vacuolated TGN in a cell replenished with cholesterol for 2 h ; the accumulation of secretory granules in the periphery of a cholesterol - replenished cell is shown in Figure 3F . These observations suggested that the block of RSP trafﬁc upon cholesterol depletion occurred at the level of the TGN . Cholesteroldepletiondoesnotinhibitmembranetrafﬁc betweentheERandtheGolgicomplex As was the case in control cells ( Figure 3A , small arrow - heads ) , numerous small vesicles associated with the Golgi complex were observed in Lovastatin - treated cells ( Figure 3C , small arrowheads ) . These vesicles presumably are the carriers mediating transport between Golgi cisternae and between the ER and the Golgi complex , implying that choles - terol depletion resulted in a speciﬁc block of secretory vesi - 954 Traffic 2000 : 1 : 952 – 962 Formation of Vesicles from the TGN cle formation from the TGN rather than a general defect in vesicular transport . To investigate this directly , we used the drug brefeldin A , which is known to cause the retrograde trafﬁc to the ER of membrane constituents of the cis - , medial - and trans - Golgi , but not the TGN ( 25 , 26 ) . Double immunoﬂuorescence of Lovastatin - treated AtT - 20 cells indi - cated that upon treatment for 30 min with brefeldin A in the continued presence of Lovastatin ( Figure 4 , BFA ) , the Golgi membrane marker GLUMEN became diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm , indicative of its redistribution to the ER . In contrast , POMC immunoreactivity remained in a clustered perinuclear location in a pattern very similar to that observed for Lovastatin - treated cells not exposed to brefeldin A ( Figure 4 , control ) . Three hours after wash - out of brefeldin A in the continued presence of Lovastatin , GLU - MEN was again found in the typical location of the Golgi complex , apparently colocalized with POMC ( Figure 4 , wash - out ) . Both the diffuse redistribution of GLUMEN upon brefeldin A treatment as well as its reclustering in the perin - uclear region upon brefeldin A wash - out were indistinguish - able between Lovastatin - treated and untreated AtT - 20 cells ( data not shown ) . These observations demonstrate that both retrograde and anterograde membrane trafﬁc between the Golgi complex and the ER still operate in cholesterol - de - pleted cells . Hence , the block of secretory vesicle formation upon cholesterol depletion reﬂects a speciﬁc effect on the TGN rather than on the entire ER – Golgi complex system . Cholesterolisessentialfortheformationofboth constitutiveandregulatedsecretoryvesiclesfromthe TGN To corrobarate these morphological ﬁndings with biochemi - cal evidence , we used [ 35 S ] sulfate pulse - chase labeling fol - lowed by subcellular fractionation ( 27 ) to investigate the effects of cholesterol depletion on secretory vesicle forma - tion from the TGN . Control cells ( grown in delipidated medium in the absence of Lovastatin ) were pulse - labeled with [ 35 S ] sulfate for 5 min and the postnuclear supernatant ( PNS ) was analyzed by velocity sucrose gradient centrifuga - tion for the distribution of the constitutive secretory protein Figure 2 : Addition of cholesterol promotes packaging of CgB into secretory granules .

Electron microscopy of AtT - 20 cells grown ( i ) in normal growth medium ( A , A % and B ) , ( ii ) for 35 h in delipidated medium containing 10 m M Lovastatin ( C , C % and D ) , and ( iii ) for 35 h in delipidated medium containing 10 m M Lovastatin followed by addition of 5 mg : ml choles - terol - cyclodextrin complex and further incubation for 2 h ( E , E % and F ) . Perinuclear regions containing the Golgi complex are shown in A , C and E . The cis - and trans - faces of the Golgi complex are labeled with c and t , respectively . Large arrowheads in A and E point to nascent immature secretory granules at the trans - face of the Golgi complex ; small arrowheads in A , C and E point to smaller vesicles that are found close to the Golgi stack and are likely to mediate vesicular transport between Golgi cisternae . Note that trans - Golgi cisternae in choles - terol - depleted cells ( C , C % ) are signiﬁcantly enlarged compared to both control cells ( A , A % ) and cholesterol - replenished cells ( E , E % ) . Another trans - Golgi region of a cholesterol - depleted cell is shown in D ; the enlarged cisternae contain condensed material ( asterisks ) in contact with the membrane , partially surrounded by a coat ( small arrows ) . Sections through the periphery of the cell , containing large dense - core secretory granules , are shown in B and F . A % , C % , E % show lower magniﬁcations giving a better impression of overall changes in Golgi organization . Equal magniﬁcations are shown in A , C and E ; in A % , C % and E % ; and in B and F ; bars represent 200 nm , the bar in E % represents 1 m m . p97 ( 28 ; 29 ) and POMC , which in AtT - 20 cells is processed to the regulated secretory peptide ACTH . Consistent with previ - ous observations ( 30 ) , both sulfated p97 and sulfated POMC ( as identiﬁed by immunoprecipitation ; see Figure 5 , top left panel ) were found to peak in fractions 7 and 8 , deﬁning the position of the TGN in the gradient ( Figure 5A ) . Upon a 15 - min chase , the majority of both sulfated proteins were recovered in the upper half of the gradient , and POMC was partially proteolytically processed , with p97 peaking in frac - tion 2 , POMC in fractions 2 – 4 , and the sulfated ACTH - con - taining processing products of POMC in fractions 3 and 4 ( Figure 5C ) . The differential distribution of p97 and the sul - fated ACTH - containing processing products of POMC in the top fractions of the gradient indicated that two populations of TGN - derived secretory vesicles were formed , i . e . constitutive secretory vesicles and immature secretory granules . The 956 Traffic 2000 : 1 : 952 – 962 Formation of Vesicles from the TGN Figure 3 : observationthatthepeakofPOMCcomprisedthepeakofboth p97 and the POMC processing products is consistent with previous observations that in AtT - 20 cells , POMC exits from the TGN in both constitutive secretory vesicles and immature secretory granules but is processed only in the latter ( 28 , 29 ) . As was the case with control AtT - 20 cells , in cells treated for 35 h with Lovastatin in delipidated medium , both p97 and POMC were found in the TGN position of the gradient after a 5 min [ 35 S ] sulfate pulse ( Figure 5B ) . However , both p97 and POMC remained in the TGN position of the gradient during a 15 - min chase indicating that the formation of constitutive secretory vesicles and immature secretory granules was blocked in the Lovastatin - treated cells ( Figure 5D ) . A small up - shift in the gradient of low molecular weight processing products probably does not reﬂect formation of 957 Traffic 2000 : 1 : 952 – 962 Wang et al . secretory vesicles but fragmentation of the TGN during cell homogenization . Consistent with the immunoﬂuorescence observations ( Figure 1 ) , the inhibitory effect of Lovastatin on the formation of both types of vesicles was reversed by the addition of 0 . 13 mM cholesterol ( in the continued presence of Lovastatin ) to the medium 2 . 5 h before the pulse - chase Table 2 : Effects of cholesterol removal and replenishment on the morphology of the AtT - 20 Golgi complex Growth condition Dilated trans Cisternae per TGN vacuoles stack per stack cisternae per stack 5 . 3 9 0 . 8 0 . 16 9 0 . 4 n . d .

No block of TGN - derived vesi - cle formation by Lovastatin was observed in cells grown in normal medium ( data not shown ) . Discussion We have shown that cholesterol is an essential component for secretory granule formation from the TGN , with choles - terol addition promoting and cholesterol depletion inhibiting this process . The inhibitory effect of cholesterol depletion is not conﬁned to the regulated pathway of secretion but also concerns the formation of constitutive secretory vesicles in neuroendocrine cells , consistent with previous observations on the apical transport vesicle in MDCK cells ( 15 ) and the axonal transport vesicle in neurons ( 16 ) . However , choles - terol depletion does not inhibit membrane trafﬁc more proxi - mal in the secretory pathway since neither the retrograde transport from the Golgi complex to the ER in the presence of brefeldin A nor the anterograde ER - to - Golgi transport upon brefeldin A wash - out was blocked in cholesterol - depleted cells . Similarly , biosynthetic ER - to - Golgi transport in MDCK cells has been found to be unaffected by cholesterol deple - tion ( 15 ) . Hence , cholesterol depletion does not perturb vesicular transport from , and to , the Golgi complex in an unspeciﬁc manner , but selectively blocks secretory vesicle formation from the TGN . Which step of secretory vesicle biogenesis is inhibited by cholesterol depletion ? As revealed by electron microscopy , ISG buds at the TGN containing aggregated : condensed secretory cargo and partial clathrin coats were frequently present in cholesterol - depleted cells . Hence , cholesterol de - pletion does not perturb lumenal parameters required for aggregation : condensation , notably TGN acidiﬁcation ( 31 , 32 ) , and allows the initiation of the budding process . However , ISG buds ready to pinch - off from the TGN were not ob - served . This suggests that cholesterol depletion blocks the last steps of the budding process and the ﬁssion step . These steps are characterized by the generation of negative curva - ture in the lumenal membrane leaﬂet . It is interesting to note that the formation of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane is also arrested upon cholesterol depletion at the transition from shallow to deeply invaginated clathrin - coated pits ( 17 , 18 ) . 959 Traffic 2000 : 1 : 952 – 962 Wang et al . Why would cholesterol depletion interfere with the genera - tion of negative membrane curvature in the lumenal leaﬂet of secretory vesicles budding from the TGN ? A feature that distinguishes such vesicles from those more proximal in the secretory pathway is their higher contents of glycosphin - golipids ( e . g . the ganglioside GM3 in secretory granules ( 33 ) ) , whose synthesis is completed in the TGN and which are conﬁned to the lumenal membrane leaﬂet ( 34 ) . Glycosphin - golipids are characterized by bulky polar headgroups , satu - rated fatty acyl chains and the trans - unsaturated sphingosine , all of which contribute to an inverted - cone shape that is better compatible with positive than negative membrane curvature . We propose that in order to be incor - porated into the lumenal leaﬂet of secretory vesicles , glyco - sphingolipids need to interact with cone - shaped lipids that favor negative membrane curvature . Cholesterol is such a lipid ( 35 ) . Cholesterol and glycosphingolipids are the key components of lipid rafts ( 13 , 36 ) . A characteristic feature of lipid rafts is their insolubility in certain detergents such as Triton X - 100 ( 37 ) . The membrane of secretory granules , like the mem - branes of constitutive secretory vesicles ( 15 ) , contain deter - gent - insoluble complexes ( 38 ) that ﬂoat in density gradients and hence can be considered lipid rafts ( 19 ) . Our observation that cholesterol is essential for the biogenesis of secretory vesicles from the TGN therefore suggests that this process requires the formation of lipid rafts . In other words , assembly of glycosphingolipids together with cholesterol into lipid rafts may be a means of packaging glycosphingolipids into the negatively curved lumenal leaﬂet of secretory vesicles . In this context , it should be noticed that the cholesterol require - ment for both the generation of vesicle curvature and lipid raft assembly might also be differential for the various types of vesicles formed at the TGN , with lipid raft assembly being more important for one vesicle type and curvature generation for the other . The proposal that assembly of cholesterol - based lipid rafts overcomes the lack - of - negative - curvature problem intrinsic to glycosphingolipids is consistent with several observations . First , glycolipids are preferentially delivered to the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells ( 39 ) , and the apical secre - tory pathway is more sensitive to cholesterol depletion than the basolateral pathway ( 15 ) . Second , synaptic vesicles con - tain very low levels of glycosphingolipids , in contrast to the presynaptic plasma membrane from which they originate ( 40 ) . In fact , given that synaptic vesicles are the smallest membrane vesicles known , both the exclusion of glycosphin - golipids during , and the cholesterol dependence of , their biogenesis ( 19 ) may reﬂect the need of generating the ex - treme negative curvature of their lumenal membrane leaﬂet . Third , the lumenal leaﬂet of the secretory granule membrane contains a remarkably high concentration of lyso - phos - phatidylcholine ( 41 ) , which , although not a glycosphingolipid , nonetheless is an inverted - cone - shaped lipid that , alone , would induce positive membrane curvature . Interestingly , lyso - phosphatidylcholine , like glycosphingolipids , forms com - plexes with cholesterol ( 42 , 43 ) . As a corollary to this , one would expect that the coalescence of lipid rafts within the TGN membrane segment that forms the future vesicle should coincide with secretory vesicle formation . Indeed , this is precisely what has been observed in the case of apical constitutive secretory vesicles ( 44 ) . It is interesting to note that none of the coats mediating the formation of vesicles in the early secretory system ( COPI and COPII ) ( 45 – 47 ) and in the endocytic pathway ( clathrin ) ( 48 ) appear to be involved in secretory vesicle formation from the TGN . ( The partial clathrin coats found on ISGs are thought to play a role in ISG maturation rather than ISG formation from the TGN ( 5 , 6 ) . ) Perhaps the coalescence of lipid rafts , i . e . a phase separation occurring in the TGN membrane , con - tributes to the driving force for the formation of secretory vesicles , parallel to the aggregation of secretory cargo in the lumen of the nascent ISG ( 14 ) . Materials and Methods AtT - 20cellculture AtT - 20 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 12 . 5 % horse serum and 2 . 5 % fetal calf serum in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . If indicated , sera were delipidated by solvent extraction as follows . Serum was mixed with an equal volume of a 2 : 1 mixture of diiso - propyl ether : n - butanol , stirred at room temperature for 30 min , and phases were separated by centrifugation at 5000 (cid:29) gfor 30 min . The aqueous phase was re - extracted as above except that only diiso - propyl ether was used , and extensively dialyzed against PBS . This treatment resulted in the reduction of the cholesterol content to B 5 % of untreated serum , as determined using a colorimetric assay kit ( Boehringer - Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) . In some experiments , AtT - 20 cells were grown in the presence of Lovastatin ( a kind gift of Merck , Sharp and Dome , Munich , Germany ) as indicated . Choles - terol complexed to methyl - b - cyclodextrin ( from Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) was prepared as described ( 49 ) . Cholesterol complexed to methyl - b - cyclodextrin was added to cells without and with prior Lovastatin treatment ; in the latter case , the presence of Lovastatin was continued . Pulse - chaselabelingofAtT - 20cellsfollowedbysubcellular fractionation Pulse - chase labeling of AtT - 20 cells was performed following estab - lished protocols ( 27 , 30 ) . Brieﬂy , AtT - 20 cells were grown to 50 % conﬂuency in normal growth medium . The medium was replaced by DMEM supplemented with delipidated sera , without or with 10 m M Lovastatin , and the cells were grown for further 36 h . The cells were washed with labeling medium ( sulfate - free DMEM supplemented with 6 . 25 % delipidated horse serum and 1 . 25 % delipidated fetal calf serum ) , equilibrated in 5 ml labeling medium for 5 min , and then pulse - labeled in this medium for 5 min by the addition of 5 mCi carrier - free [ 35 S ] sulfate . When indicated , the cells were chased for 15 min in 10 ml labeling medium lacking [ 35 S ] sulfate and containing 3 . 2 mM Na 2 SO 4 . Pulse - chase labeling of cells grown in the presence of Lovastatin was performed in the continued presence of 10 m M Lovastatin . The cells were harvested , a PNS was prepared and subjected to velocity sucrose gradient centrifugation ( 0 . 3 – 1 . 4 M sucrose ) as described ( 27 ) . The gradients were fractionated ( 12 fractions plus pellet ) and [ 35 S ] sulfate - labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE followed by phosphoimaging . Immunoprecipitation of ACTH - containing peptides from the PNS of [ 35 S ] sulfate - labeled AtT - 20 cells was performed as described ( 29 ) . 960 Traffic 2000 : 1 : 952 – 962 Formation of Vesicles from the TGN Doubleimmunoﬂuorescenceconfocalmicroscopy Double immunoﬂuorescence of paraformaldehyde - ﬁxed AtT - 20 cells on coverslips was performed according to standard procedures ( 50 ) , using either mAb219 . 6 against rat CgB ( 50 ) or mAb1E4 ( Biogenesis , Poole , UK ) against the 50 N - terminal residues of human POMC and afﬁnity - puriﬁed rabbit antibody against GLUMEN , a Golgi - resident 29 kDa transmembrane protein whose lumenal domain corresponds to NESP55 ( 21 ) and which is encoded by the XL2 exon of the rat XL a s gene ( 22 ) ( Y . Wang , R . Kehlenbach , M . J . Hannah and W . B . Huttner , unpublished results ) . The immunostaining pattern for the latter protein was very similar to , if not indistinguishable from , that for the established Golgi marker GM130 ( 51 ) ( data not shown ) . The primary antibodies were detected by LRSC - conjugated goat antibody against mouse IgG ( Dianova , Hamburg , Germany ) and FITC - conjugated goat antibody against rabbit IgG ( ICN , Costa Mesa , CA ) . The coverslips were mounted in Moviol and observed with a Leica ( Mannheim , Germany ) TCS 4D confocal laser scanning microscope . The confocal microscope settings were such that the photomultipliers were within their linear range . The images shown were prepared from the confo - cal data ﬁles using Adobe ( Mountain View , CA ) photoshop software . Electronmicroscopy AtT - 20 cells were washed with 100 mM cacodylate buffer pH 7 . 4 , ﬁxed with 1 % glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer , postﬁxed in 1 % ( w : v ) OsO 4 : 1 . 5 % ( w : v ) magnesium ferricyanide , and contrasted with 1 . 5 % ( w : v ) magnesium uranyl acetate . Samples were then dehy - drated in ethanol and embedded in Epon . Ultrathin sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed in a Zeiss EM 10 CR electron microscope . Cholesterolandphospholipiddetermination Aliquots of pelleted membranes were extracted with chloroform : methanol using a modiﬁed version of the Wessel - Fluegge protocol ( 52 ) , and the lipids in the chloroform phase were separated by thin - layer chromatography using silica gel 60 ( Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) and chloroform : methanol : water 65 : 25 : 4 . Lipids were visu - alized by spraying the plate with 20 % sulfuric acid followed by heating to 140°C . Cholesterol appeared as a red spot and phospho - lipids as yellow - green spots . The spots were scanned and quantiﬁed using the MacBas software package . Acknowledgments We thank Andrea Hellwig for performing the electron microscopy and Dr .
