Interaction of BiP with the J - domain of the Sec63p Component of the Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein Translocation Complex * ( Received for publication , April 8 , 1999 ) Benjamin Misselwitz , Oliver Staeck , Kent E . S . Matlack , and Tom A . Rapoport‡ From the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Cell Biology , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Proteins of the Hsp70 family of ATPases interact with a conserved domain of their J - protein partners , the J - domain , to function in numerous cellular processes . We have studied the interaction of BiP , an Hsp70 family member in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum , with the J - domain of Sec63p , a component of the Sec complex involved in post - translational protein translo - cation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane . In a real - time solid phase binding assay , BiP binds to the immobilized Sec complex or to a fusion protein of the J - domain and glutathione S - transferase in a reaction that requires ATP hydrolysis . In the final complex , BiP is bound in the ADP form with its peptide binding pocket occupied . An intact peptide binding pocket is required for this interaction . Our experiments suggest that the activation of BiP by the J - domain involves a transient contact between these components , and that in the absence of physiological substrates , J - activated BiP binds even to the J - proteins themselves . Hsp70s exist in most cellular compartments . They partici - pate in many different processes , including protein folding , assembly and disassembly of protein complexes , uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles , and transport of proteins across mem - branes ( for review , see Refs . 1 – 4 ) . Hsp70s are able to perform these apparently different tasks because of their ability to reversibly bind polypeptides . Hsp70s bind peptides through a peptide binding pocket which is regulated by the NH 2 - terminal ATPase domain ( for review , see Ref . 4 ) . With ATP bound to the ATPase domain , the peptide binding pocket is open and pep - tides can rapidly bind and dissociate . In the presence of ADP , the pocket is closed and covered by a lid domain ( 5 ) , and association and dissociation of peptides are much slower ( 6 , 7 ) . To bind substrates under physiological conditions Hsp70s cooperate with their co - factors , the J - proteins ( for review , see Ref . 8 ) . J - proteins are a ubiquitous family defined by a con - served domain of about 70 amino acids , the J - domain . In addi - tion , they contain other , nonconserved domains which are re - sponsible for association of the J - proteins with different polypeptide substrates . It is believed that the J - domain inter - acts with Hsp70 molecules and stimulates their ATPase activ - ity ( 9 ) . The ensuing rapid closure of the peptide binding pocket would trap the substrate within the closed pocket of the ADP form of the Hsp70 molecule . The J - domain would thus stimu - late peptide binding by Hsp70s ( 10 , 11 ) . Release of the bound Hsp70 molecule from the peptide substrate would occur when exchange of ADP for ATP re - opens the peptide binding pocket ( 11 ) . Under equilibrium conditions , an isolated Hsp70 has a preference for peptide sequences of at least seven mostly hy - drophobic amino acids ( 12 – 14 ) . Activation by the J - domain causes a steady - state situation which allows an Hsp70 to bind even polar peptides ( 11 ) . Two models have been proposed for how the J - domain inter - acts with an Hsp70 . In one model , the ATP form of the Hsp70 would bind to the J - domain , the nucleotide would be hydro - lyzed , and the Hsp70 would be stably bound in its ADP form to the J - domain . This would represent an activated form of the Hsp70 which could subsequently be transferred to a peptide substrate ( 15 – 17 ) . This mechanism is supported by experi - ments in which eukaryotic Hsp70s were found to be bound in their ADP form to fusion proteins of a J - domain to glutathione S - transferase ( GST - J ) 1 ( 16 , 17 ) . However , it was not demon - strated that the GST - J z Hsp70 z ADP complex represented a pre - cursor for the Hsp70 - peptide substrate interaction . In an alter - native model , the interaction of the Hsp70 with the J - domain would be extremely transient , even in the absence of a peptide substrate ( see Ref . 4 , and references therein ) . In the presence of a substrate , the Hsp70 would immediately be transferred from the J - domain to the peptide , resulting in a stable peptide z Hsp70 z ADP complex . This view is supported by experiments involving DnaK , the bacterial Hsp70 , and its J - partner DnaJ ( 10 ) . It is possible that the different results reflect fundamental differences between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic Hsp70 systems . A well studied system in which an Hsp70 family member plays an essential role is the post - translational transport of proteins across the membrane of the yeast endoplasmic retic - ulum ( for review , see Refs . 18 and 19 ) . The lumenal Hsp70 family member BiP ( Kar2p ) is required to transport proteins through a channel in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane formed by the Sec complex ( 20 – 23 ) . The J - partner for BiP is a lumenal domain of the Sec63p component of the Sec complex ( 15 , 17 , 24 , 25 ) . Upon interaction with the J - domain of Sec63p , BiP binds to the translocation substrate and prevents its back - wards movement through the channel , thus acting as a molec - ular ratchet . 2 Whether BiP also actively “pulls” on the sub - strate is unclear ( 26 ) . In the present study , we have investigated the binding of yeast BiP to GST - J and to the Sec complex .

BiP appears to interact with the J - domain only very transiently , but this brief interaction is sufficient to induce nucleotide hydrolysis and activate BiP for peptide binding . Thus , BiP does not “wait” for the substrate while bound to the J - domain . Our data indicate that the tran - sient nature of the Hsp70 - J interaction is conserved between eukaryotes and prokaryotes . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cloning and Purification of GST - J— DNA encoding the J - domain of SEC63 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using 5 9 - primer , CGCGGGGATCCCCACAAAATTATTTGATCCTTATG , and 3 9 - primer , CGCGGAATTCCCGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGTGGATGACCGT - ATTTCAAAT . The product was cloned into pGEX - 3x ( Pharmacia ) . The GST - J fusion protein was purified essentially as described in Ref . 17 , using its affinity to a GSH column ( Pharmacia ) and a Ni - NTA column ( Qiagen ) , extensively dialyzed against buffer A ( 150 m M KCl , 50 m M Hepes , pH 7 . 0 , 5 m M MgCl 2 ) , and frozen in aliquots . Purification of BiP and BiP Mutants— The plasmid pMR2606 encod - ing wild type BiP was a kind gift from Mark Rose . The plasmids encoding BiP mutants T249G , G247D , and T59G have been described ( 27 , 28 ) . Plasmids encoding the BiP peptide binding mutants G488D , G445D , V519R , and T448R were made with the P - Alter system ( Pro - mega ) . The proteins were purified as described ( 22 ) and gel filtered with a PD10 column ( Pharmacia ) equilibrated in buffer A . All protein con - centrations were determined , using the method described in Ref . 29 . SPR Experiments— Experiments were done on a BIAcore upgrade machine , using CM5 research grade chips ( BIAcore ) at 25 °C . Buffer A was used as the running buffer at a flow rate of 5 – 7 m l / min . GST - J was immobilized in a sodium acetate buffer , pH 4 – 5 , via NH 2 - specific cross - linking following the instructions of the manufacturer ( BIAcore ) . The chip was first activated using EDC and N - hydroxysuccinimide , followed by the immobilization of GST - J and quenching of excess reagent with ethanolamine . If not otherwise indicated , the chip was first equilibrated with buffer A containing 1 m g / ml leupeptin , 0 . 5 m g / ml chymostatin , 0 . 25 m g / ml elastatinal , and 0 . 1 m g / ml pepstatin A as protease inhibitors and 2 m M nucleotide , followed by the injection of BiP in an otherwise identical buffer . The chip was regenerated by a brief injection of 1 % Triton and 1 m M ATP in buffer A . The chip did not loose more then 10 % of its BiP binding activity after 12 rounds of BiP injections . For the dissociation experiments , BiP in buffer A including 2 m M ATP and protease inhibitors was injected first , followed by injection of 2 m M nucleotide , with or without 2 m M peptide P5 in an otherwise identical buffer lacking BiP . For the peptide inhibition studies , the chip was equilibrated as described , in the presence of peptide followed by the injection of BiP in an otherwise identical buffer . Peptide binding studies were done as described previously ( 11 ) . The chip was first equilibrated in buffer with nucleotide and protease inhibitors as described above with or without GST - J , followed by injection of BiP in an otherwise identical buffer . Binding of BiP to the Sec Complex— The Sec complex was purified as described previously ( 22 ) from a wild type or a sec63 - 1 strain . For experiments with the Sec complex , streptavidin chips ( BIAcore ) were used with buffer B ( 150 m M KCl , 50 m M Hepes , pH 7 . 0 , 5 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M MnCl 2 , 5 m M CaCl 2 , 7 m M b - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 5 % digitonin ( Merck ) ) . The Sec complex was immobilized by first injecting saturating amounts of biotinylated protein A , followed by a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide epitope at the cytosolic part of Sec62p , and finally the Sec complex . By this procedure , approximately 1200 RU Sec complex could be immobilized . For the injection of BiP , the chip was first equilibrated in a buffer identical to buffer B , except instead of digitonin the detergent Deoxy - Big - Chap ( Calbiochem ) was used in the presence of 1 m M ADP or ATP , followed by an injection of BiP in an otherwise identical buffer . BiP also bound specifically to the Sec com - plex in the presence of the detergent digitonin ( data not shown ) , al - though somewhat more weakly , most likely because the larger micelles of the detergent digitonin are able to shield parts of the J - domain of Sec63p . ATPase Experiments— BiP ( 32 m M ) was incubated either with or without peptide P5 at 1 m M and the indicated concentration of J - GST in buffer A at room temperature in a final volume of 20 m l . The reactions were started by adding a mixture of 4 m M ATP and [ a - 32 P ] ATP and incubated for 120 min . At different time points , samples were taken and applied to polyethyleneimide - cellulose . The cellulose sheets were devel - oped by thin layer chromatography in a 0 . 5 M LiCl , 0 . 5 M formic acid buffer , and analyzed using a Fujix PhosphorImager . If not otherwise indicated , chemicals were purchased from Sigma . Release of pp a F from the Sec Complex— Experiments were done exactly as described previously . ( 28 ) . RESULTS BiP Binds to GST - J— In previous experiments stable interactions between Hsp70 family members and fusion proteins of their J - protein partners with GST were observed ( 16 , 17 ) , but the nature of these complexes remained unclear . To further investigate this interaction , we used recombinant BiP and a fusion of the J - domain of Sec63p with GST ( GST - J ) in a surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) assay ( 30 ) . In an SPR assay , one component is immobilized on a surface , and the interaction partner is in a solution which is passed over it . Binding between the two increases the refractive index at the surface . The signal ( given in response units , RU ) is directly proportional to the mass of protein bound to the surface . This assay makes it possible to follow the association and dissociation of proteins in real time . GST - J was immobilized via NH 2 - specific cross - linking and binding of BiP was tested in the presence of ATP or ADP . In ATP , BiP was bound with fast kinetics , while in ADP the response was as low as in the absence of GST - J ( Fig . 1 A , see also Ref . 17 ) . In agreement with previous results ( 17 ) , the GST - J z BiP complex could also be isolated with GSH beads ( data not shown ) . Previous experiments have demonstrated that BiP binds neither to GST alone nor to a GST - J molecule containing the sec63 - 1 point mutation in its J - domain ( 17 ) . To determine the apparent affinity of BiP for GST - J , we measured the time course of binding for different BiP concentrations in the pres - ence of ATP . The dependence of the plateau values on the BiP concen - tration could not be fitted with a single binding constant ; the half - maximum concentration was approximately 5 m M ( Fig . 1 B ) . In the F IG . 1 . Binding of BiP to GST - J . A , 1000 RU of GST - J were immo - bilized . At time 0 , a solution containing 10 m M BiP and either 2 m M ADP or ATP was introduced ( arrow , “ BiP ” ) . “ Buffer” indicates the point at which the BiP solution was replaced with buffer alone ( arrow ) . The dashed curve gives the background binding of BiP with ATP but in the absence of GST - J ( background ) . B , 1200 RU of GST - J were immobilized . Different concentrations of BiP were introduced in the presence of either 2 m M ADP ( circles ) or ATP ( triangles ) . The response was followed with time and the maximum values were plotted versus the BiP concentration . Interaction of BiP with J - proteins 20111 b y gue s t , on O c t obe r 11 , 2010 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m presence of ADP only negligible binding of BiP to GST - J was observed . Since the signal of the SPR assay is directly proportional to the mass of protein on the surface , we were able to determine the stoichiometry of the GST - J z BiP complex . Taking into account the different molecular weights of BiP and GST - J , we estimate that at the highest BiP concen - tration an average of approximately two BiP molecules are bound to each GST - J molecule . Binding of BiP to GST - J Requires ATP Hydrolysis— Since the bind - ing of BiP to GST - J is strictly dependent on ATP , the ATP - bound form of BiP is likely to make the initial interaction with the J - domain . To determine whether ATP hydrolysis is required for the binding of BiP to GST - J , we employed BiP mutants with single amino acid changes in their ATPase domain ( 27 , 28 ) . The mutants are trapped at different stages of the ATPase cycle . BiP G247D is unable to bind ATP , BiP T59G binds ATP , but is unable to undergo a conformational change following ATP binding , and BiP T249G binds ATP and undergoes the conforma - tional change , but fails to hydrolyze the bound nucleotide ( Ref . 27 , and data not shown ) . As shown in Fig . 2 , none of these mutants interacted with GST - J , demonstrating that ATP hydrolysis is required . Previous experiments with nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP led to the same conclusion ( 17 ) , but protease protection and peptide binding experi - ments indicate that , in contrast to the mutation T249G , the analogs do not induce the genuine ATP conformation of BiP ( data not shown ) . ATP hydrolysis during binding of GST - J is also supported by pull - down experiments with GSH beads which demonstrated that the nucleotide bound to GST - J - BiP is ADP ( data not shown , see also Refs . 16 and 17 ) . Effects of a Hydrophobic Peptide— We next tested whether the GST - J z BiP complex was an activated precursor for BiP’s interaction with peptides as has been suggested ( 16 , 17 ) or whether it represented a subsequent state with GST - J bound to the peptide binding pocket of BiP . To distinguish between these two models we investigated the effects of the hydrophobic peptide P5 ( ALLLSAPRR ; Ref . 31 ) . This peptide binds BiP well in ADP ( K d about 20 m M ) , but much more weakly in ATP ( 11 ) . We first tested whether the pre - binding of P5 would inhibit BiP’s interaction with GST - J . As shown in Fig . 3 A , peptide P5 in solution competed with immobilized GST - J for BiP binding . At the highest peptide concentration used , binding of BiP was reduced to approximately 15 % of the original value . We estimate an inhibition constant of approximately 500 m M for the peptide . To investigate the effect of peptide on the dissociation of BiP from GST - J , BiP was prebound to GST - J with or without ATP , and its dissociation was followed in ATP or ADP in the absence or presence of 2 m M peptide P5 ( Fig . 3 B ) . The dissociation in ADP was relatively slow ( estimated half - life approximately 100 s , see also Ref . 16 ) and biphasic , probably due to the different dissociation rates of the multiple BiP molecules bound to GST - J . The peptide had no effect on the dissociation rate . In ATP the release of BiP was significantly faster ( half - life ap - proximately 12 s ) , and the peptide had a small effect , most likely by preventing the re - binding of dissociated BiP to GST - J . The inhibitory effect of the peptide on the formation of the GST - J z BiP complex ( Fig . 3 A ) is therefore not due to an increased off - rate of BiP . In addition , the dissociation kinetics of BiP from GST - J in ADP and ATP are very similar to those for the dissociation of BiP from a synthetic peptide ( 11 ) . These data therefore suggest that GST - J is bound to BiP as a peptide substrate , arguing that the complex represents the final BiP - substrate interaction , rather than a precursor to it . GST - J and Peptide P5 Stimulate BiP’s ATPase Activity— To exclude the possibility that the peptide prevents BiP from interacting with the J - domain , we tested whether GST - J could stimulate the ATPase activ - ity of BiP in the presence of peptide . BiP’s ATPase activity was followed with or without peptide P5 and GST - J , allowing each BiP molecule to hydrolyze many molecules of ATP ( Fig . 3 C ) . BiP alone hydrolyzed ATP at a rate of approximately 0 . 1 mol / mol / min . GST - J stimulated this basal rate approximately 5 - fold ( see also Ref . 17 ) with maximal stimulation reached at stoichiometric amounts of GST - J relative to BiP . In the absence of GST - J , peptide P5 stimulated BiP’s ATPase activity approx - imately 2 - fold . Addition of GST - J resulted in further stimulation . At saturating amounts of GST - J , BiP’s ATPase activity with and without peptide was indistinguishable . We conclude that even though the pep - tide inhibited the stable binding of BiP to GST - J ( Fig . 3 A ) , it did not prevent a transient interaction which led to the stimulation of BiP’s ATPase activity . These data are consistent with the view that the J - domain of GST - J activates BiP to bind GST - J as a peptide substrate . Effect of GST - J on BiP’s Peptide Binding Activity— If BiP binds GST - J as a peptide substrate , its peptide binding pocket should be occupied in the GST - J z BiP complex and unable to bind other peptides . To test this prediction , we investigated the binding of BiP to the hydro - phobic peptide P5 , immobilized via a 6 - amino acid spacer , in the ab - sence or presence of GST - J . As reported before , BiP binds to the peptide more strongly in ADP than in ATP ( Fig . 3 D , solid curves ; Ref . 11 ) . The on - and off - rates are relatively slow in ADP and significantly faster in ATP , consistent with closed and open peptide binding pockets of BiP , respectively ( 7 , 11 ) . Next , we mixed GST - J in solution with BiP and ATP before passing the mixture over the peptide surface . As discussed above , GST - J rapidly stimulates the ATPase activity of BiP , thereby converting BiP - ATP into GST - J z BiP z ADP . However , when compared with BiP - ADP , the binding was drastically reduced ( Fig . 3 D , broken curves ) . Thus , the complex of GST - J z BiP z ADP cannot interact with the peptide because BiP’s peptide binding pocket is already occupied . We conclude that this complex is not an activated precursor for subsequent peptide binding but , to the contrary , prevents such an interaction . BiP Mutants Defective in Peptide Binding— We next tested whether BiP’s peptide binding activity is required for the formation of the GST - J z BiP complex . Point mutations were introduced into BiP’s peptide binding pocket to render it nonfunctional . The mutations G445D and G488D were chosen because analogous mutations were found in a genetic screen for mutations in the peptide - binding domain of DnaK in Escherichia coli ( 32 ) . The mutations V519R and T448R should fill the binding pocket with a bulky residue ( 5 ) , and therefore might inhibit peptide binding . Indeed , none of these BiP mutants was able to bind the hydrophobic peptide P5 ( Fig . 4 A ) . They were , however , able to hydrolyze ATP efficiently ( data not shown ) and were thus clearly different from the three ATPase mutants described above , which can bind peptides ( data not shown ) , but fail to hydrolyze ATP . None of the peptide - binding mutants was able to bind GST - J ( Fig . 4 B ) . A similar mutant in DnaK was also unable to bind to DnaJ ( 33 ) . Furthermore , a truncation mutant of BiP containing only the ATPase domain was unable to bind GST - J ( data not shown ) . On the other hand , a mutant lacking the COOH - terminal lid domain but maintaining the ATPase and peptide - binding domains was still able to bind GST - J ( data not shown , see also Refs . 11 , 34 , and 35 ) . Taken together , BiP’s peptide binding activity appears to be required for the generation of a stable GST - J z BiP complex . All peptide binding mutants were tested for their ability to move the translocation substrate pre - pro - a - factor ( pp a F ) through the channel formed by the Sec complex ( 28 ) . While wild type BiP releases pp a F from the preformed complex of pp a F and Sec complex , the peptide - binding mutants were much less active ( Fig . 4 C ) . Previous experiments had demonstrated that the release reaction reflects transport of pp a F through the channel ( 28 ) . We conclude that BiP’s peptide binding ac - tivity is required for protein transport into the endoplasmic reticulum . In testing a large number of mutants , we have found a perfect correla - tion between the decrease in BiP binding to GST - J and defects in BiP’s activity in a translocation assay . In addition , our data indicate that the functions of both the ATPase and peptide - binding domain are required for J - activated peptide binding . Binding of BiP to the Sec Complex— Based on the experiments with GST - J , we reasoned that , in the absence of a translocation substrate , BiP might bind to the Sec complex itself . In fact , in previous experi - ments stable complexes of BiP with the J - protein Sec63p could be isolated from yeast microsomal membranes ( 15 ) . We immobilized the soluble , purified Sec complex via an antibody against the Sec62p component . BiP was passed over it in a detergent - containing buffer with either ATP or ADP . As with GST - J , the binding of BiP to the Sec complex was significantly stronger in ATP than in ADP ( Fig . 5 , solid curves ) . The lower level of binding in ADP is probably due to the presence of hydrophobic domains of the Sec complex . Binding was specific for the Sec complex since in its absence only the residual response due to changes caused by the presence of BiP in solution was F IG . 2 . ATP hydrolysis mutants of BiP do not bind GST - J . 600 RU of GST - J were immobilized . At time 0 a solution containing 2 m M ATP and either 15 m M wild type BiP ( wt ) or mutants carrying point mutations in their ATPase domain were introduced . Mutant G247D is unable to bind nucleotide , T59G is unable to undergo a conformational change after ATP binding , and T249G fails to hydrolyze the bound ATP . Interaction of BiP with J - proteins 20112 b y gue s t , on O c t obe r 11 , 2010 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m observed ( Fig . 5 , lower dashed curves ) . To further test the specificity of the interaction , we used the Sec complex purified from the sec63 - 1 mutant , containing a point mutation in the J - domain of Sec63p ( 36 ) which makes it defective in translocation ( 37 ) . This protein was inactive since binding of BiP in the presence of ATP was identical to that in the presence of ADP ( Fig . 5 , upper dashed curves , see also Ref . 15 ) . ATP - dependent binding was also observed with a subcomplex of the Sec complex ( 38 ) , containing Sec62p , Sec63p , Sec71p , and Sec72p ( data not shown ) . Taken together , these data indi - cate that the J - domain of Sec63p can activate BiP to bind to the Sec complex in a manner that is analogous to the interaction observed with the GST - J fusion protein . DISCUSSION Our experiments discriminate between two models proposed for the interaction of an Hsp70 molecule with its J - protein partner . Our data are inconsistent with a model in which , in the absence of a substrate , Hsp70 forms an activated , stable J z Hsp70 z ADP complex , from which the bound Hsp70 is subse - quently transferred to a peptide ( 15 – 17 ) . Rather , they suggest that Hsp70 interacts only very transiently with the J - domain and is immediately transferred to a peptide substrate , be it the natural substrate or the J - protein itself ( 4 , 10 ) . Although we confirm the generation of a stable J - protein z Hsp70 z ADP com - plex in an ATP - dependent reaction , we demonstrate that the Hsp70 is bound to the J - protein as if it were a peptide sub - strate . The complex therefore represents the final , rather than an intermediate , state of the peptide binding reaction . The following observations support our conclusion . 1 ) A hy - drophobic peptide in solution competes with GST - J for the formation of the GST - J z BiP z ADP complex . The peptide does not accelerate the dissociation of BiP from GST - J , nor does it pre - vent the interaction of GST - J with BiP that is required for ATPase stimulation . We therefore conclude that the peptide exerts its inhibitory effect by occupying the same peptide - binding domain to which GST - J is ultimately bound . In addi - tion , in agreement with other results ( 4 , 10 , 33 , 35 , 39 ) , these data show that peptide and J - domain interact with BiP at different sites . 2 ) Since the GST - J z BiP z ADP complex binds a hydrophobic peptide much more weakly than BiP z ADP , GST - J must block BiP’s peptide binding pocket . 3 ) The fact that two BiP molecules are bound per GST - J molecule and the biphasic dissociation kinetics argue against the existence of a stable , defined J - domain - BiP interaction . Rather , these data indicate that BiP molecules are bound to at least two distinct regions of GST - J . 4 ) The kinetics of dissociation of BiP from GST - J re - sembles that of BiP from peptide substrates . In both cases dissociation is fast in ATP and slow in ADP , as expected from open and closed peptide binding pockets , respectively ( 7 , 11 ) . 5 ) Binding of BiP to peptide when co - immobilized with the J - domain ( 11 ) is strikingly similar to BiP’s interaction with im - mobilized GST - J . The kinetics of association and dissociation are very similar , ATP hydrolysis is required for the binding reaction , and the final complex contains ADP . We therefore conclude that formation of the GST - J z BiP z ADP complex in - volves the activation of BiP by the J - domain . 6 ) BiP mutants whose peptide binding activity is altered by point mutations or deletions fail to bind GST - J . 7 ) Similarly to the results with GST - J , BiP can be transferred in a J - domain - and ATP - depend - ent manner to the Sec complex itself . Limited availability of the purified Sec complex and its dissociation from the surface dur - ing subsequent SPR experiments have made it impossible to demonstrate directly that the peptide binding pocket of BiP is involved in this interaction . However , the analogy between GST - J and the Sec complex strongly suggests that BiP binds both in an identical manner . Our results suggest that a J - domain z BiP z ATP complex , which is too short - lived to be detected in conventional binding exper - iments , is transiently formed . The short half - life is caused by the J - protein inducing rapid ATP hydrolysis by BiP . Upon ATP hydrolysis , BiP binds to peptides in close proximity to the J - domain ( 11 ) . The final complex contains BiP , ADP , and pep - tide , but lacks the J - domain . BiP is rather promiscuous follow - ing J - activation and can therefore bind to essentially any sub - F IG . 3 . Influence of a hydrophobic peptide on BiP’s interaction with GST - J . A , 1200 RU of GST - J were immobilized . A solution containing both 2 m M ATP and the indicated concentrations of peptide P5 was introduced , and at time 0 10 m M BiP was added . B , 600 RU of GST - J were immobilized . BiP was pre - bound to GST - J in the presence of ATP . Dissociation was followed in the presence of 2 m M ADP or ATP , without ( solid curves ) or with ( dashed curves ) 2 m M peptide P5 . C , a steady state ATPase experiment was performed by incubating 32 m M BiP with different concentrations of GST - J , either without ( circles ) or with ( triangles ) 1 m M peptide P5 . The reactions were started by adding a mixture of [ a - 32 P ] ATP and ATP to a final concentration of 4 m M . At the indicated time points the amount of hydrolyzed nucleotide was determined by thin layer chromatography . The hydrolysis rate is plotted versus the molar ratio GST - J : BiP . D , 1300 RU of peptide P5 were immobilized using a 6 - amino acid spacer . A buffer containing either 2 m M ADP or ATP ( solid curves ) or 2 m M ATP and the indicated concentrations of GST - J ( dashed curves ) was introduced and , at time 0 , 10 m M BiP was added . Interaction of BiP with J - proteins 20113 b y gue s t , on O c t obe r 11 , 2010 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m strate ( 11 ) , including polypeptide parts of the J - protein itself . The peptide motifs in the J - proteins to which BiP is bound are unknown , but they are probably outside the J - domain . Our data argue against a previously proposed model in which BiP in its ADP form would wait for the translocation substrate while bound to the J - domain at the lumenal end of the channel ( 15 ) . Although we have confirmed that BiP associ - ates with the Sec complex or the Sec62 / 63p subcomplex in a J - and ATP - dependent manner , this complex is likely not a pre - cursor for peptide interaction . Rather , in the absence of a translocation substrate , BiP appears to bind to polypeptide segments of the Sec complex , as observed with the GST - J protein . During translocation , the translocating polypeptide would emerge from the channel close to the J - domain of Sec63p and J - activated BiP would be transferred to the substrate . Once bound , BiP would prevent backwards movements of the polypeptide chain , thus acting as a molecular ratchet . 2 BiP was also proposed to pull on the translocation substrate ( 26 ) . How - ever , this would require a conformational change of BiP while bound simultaneously to the J - domain and the polypeptide substrate , which seems unlikely given the transient nature of the BiP - J interaction . Simultaneous binding is also rendered unlikely by our finding that more than one BiP molecule could bind to GST - J . Moreover , since the addition of peptide does not stimulate the dissociation of BiP from its complex with GST - J , a complex containing BiP , J - domain , and translocation sub - strate would be stable , preventing any movement of the polypeptide chain . J - activated binding of BiP to polypeptide segments of the Sec complex in the absence of a translocation substrate may have physiological significance . Mammalian BiP was proposed to seal the lumenal end of the channel to small ions ( 40 ) . In an analogous manner , BiP may serve to seal the channel in the post - translational pathway . J - activated BiP would continu - ously associate with and dissociate from the Sec complex , pro - viding a dynamic lid for the channel , and would switch to binding of a translocation substrate as soon as it emerges from the lumenal end of the channel . “Futile” ATP hydrolysis would not be excessively high because the steady state ATPase activ - ity is only stimulated 5 - fold by the J - protein . On the other hand , it is possible that the J - domain is only exposed for BiP interaction once a translocation substrate is bound to the channel . Our results may also have relevance for studies on the im - port of proteins into mitochondria ( 26 , 41 – 44 ) . There , a stable complex of mitochondrial Hsp70 with its partner protein of the inner membrane , Tim44p , is formed following ATP hydrolysis ( 45 ) . In light of our results , it appears questionable whether it represents a precursor for substrate binding . A dimeric complex between Hsp70 and peptide appears to be F IG . 4 . Mutants defective in peptide binding . A , 1000 RU of peptide P5 were immobilized using a 6 - amino acid spacer . A buffer containing 2 m M ADP was introduced and , at time 0 , 20 m M wild type BiP ( wt ) or BiP mutants carrying point mutations in their peptide - binding domain were added . B , as in A , except that 1300 RU of GST - J were immobilized and binding was tested in the presence of 2 m M ATP . C , a soluble complex between radiolabeled pp a F and the Sec complex was generated and incubated with increasing concentrations of either wild type ( wt , squares ) BiP or of BiP mutants containing a defective peptide binding pocket : BiP G445D ( diamonds ) , BiP V519R ( triangles ) , BiP T448R ( circles ) , or BiP G488D ( crosses ) , respectively . The Sec complex was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Sec62p and the amount of co - precipitated pp a F determined . The data are normalized to the amount of pp a F bound to the Sec complex in the absence of added BiP . F IG . 5 . BiP binds to the Sec complex . The Sec complex was im - mobilized via its affinity to an anti - Sec62p antibody . At time 0 30 m M BiP was added to the buffer containing either 1 m M ADP or ATP , which was passing continuously over the surface . At the time point where the curves begin to fall , the BiP solution was replaced by buffer . Controls were performed in the absence of Sec complex ( lower dashed curves ) or with the Sec complex from the sec63 - 1 mutant , carrying a point muta - tion in the J - domain ( upper dashed curves ) . Interaction of BiP with J - proteins 20114 b y gue s t , on O c t obe r 11 , 2010 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m the general end product in many Hsp70 systems , such as the auxilin - Hsc70 system responsible for the uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles ( 16 , 46 ) . Our data indicate that such complexes only form efficiently in the presence of a J - domain , despite the presence of high concentrations of Hsp70s in the cell . Previ - ously it has been observed that in the presence of ATP the yeast J - protein Ydj1p releases an unfolded protein from the cytosolic Hsp70 homolog Ssa1p ( 47 ) . In light of our data it seems possible that , under these conditions , Ydj1p competes with the unfolded protein for binding of activated Ssa1p , thus apparently stimu - lating peptide dissociation . In the bacterial system a transient interaction between DnaK and the J - domain of DnaJ has been demonstrated ( 4 , 10 , 48 ) . The J - domain alone did not stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK , in contrast to either the J - domain plus a following domain ( G / F - domain ) ( 49 ) , the full - length DnaJ , or the J - do - main plus a separately added hydrophobic peptide ( 10 ) . It is therefore possible that with the longer J - protein constructs DnaK is targeted to segments COOH - terminal of the J - domain ( 10 ) . The ATP - dependent formation of a complex between DnaK and DnaJ ( 33 , 35 , 50 ) is thus likely to be similar to that between GST - J and BiP , with a peptide segment occupying the peptide - binding domain of the Hsp70 . Recently , the binding site for the J - domain has been mapped to a region in the ATPase domain of DnaK ( 33 , 35 ) . In addition , using NMR a nucleotide - independent interaction between the J - domain of DnaJ and the ATPase domain of DnaK was found ( 39 ) , pre - sumably reflecting the transient interaction that escapes de - tection in other experiments . Taken together , it appears that the interaction between a J - domain and Hsp70 is highly con - served in evolution . Acknowledgments— We thank T . Kirchhausen and W .
