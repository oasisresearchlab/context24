In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , formins and the actin - monomer - binding protein profilin are specifically required to assemble linear actin structures called ‘actin cables’ . These structures seem to be assembled independently of the Arp2 / 3 complex , the only well characterized cellular mediator of actin nucleation . Here , an activated yeast formin was purified and found to promote the nucleation of actin filaments in vitro . Formin - dependent actin nucle - ation was stimulated by profilin . Thus , formin and profilin mediate actin nucleation by an Arp2 / 3 - independent mechanism . These findings suggest that distinct actin nucleation mechanisms may underlie the assembly of dif - ferent actin cytoskeletal structures . T he mechanisms that govern the assembly of different actin cytoskeletal structures are poorly defined . Actin cytoskeletal structures are composed of actin filaments that can be assem - bled into different types of array : for example , networks of branched actin filaments or bundles of linear actin filaments . Actin filaments have structurally distinct ends , termed the barbed and pointed ends 1 . New actin filaments are generated by severing old filaments or by nucleation , where two to three actin monomers associate to form a short filament 1 – 3 . The Arp2 / 3 complex is the only known nucleator of actin filaments whose in vivo nucleating role is well established . The Arp2 / 3 complex , when activated by regulators , promotes barbed - end actin assembly , capping the pointed end . The Arp2 / 3 complex also binds to the sides of actin filaments and promotes the formation of branched filaments . This branching activity may be an important element in ‘templating’ the morphology of certain actin structures 1 – 3 . Recent experiments suggest that the Arp2 / 3 complex may nucle - ate actin filaments for only a subset of actin cytoskeletal struc - tures 4 – 8 . One actin structure that seems to be assembled independ - ently of the Arp2 / 3 complex is the actin cables of budding yeast 4 , 7 , 8 . Yeast actin cables are linear actin structures that function as tracks for the directional transport of materials required for polarized cell growth . Yeast actin cables are assembled in vivo by a mechanism that requires formins 4 , 7 , 9 . Cells that lack functional formins do not assemble actin cables , whereas cells that express activated formins assemble a dense network of supernumerary actin cables 4 , 7 . Formins , such as Bni1 ( bud neck involved ) , have been proposed to function as scaffold proteins that regulate actin , microtubules and intracellular signalling directly downstream of Rho - type GTPases ( Fig . 1a ) 6 , 10 . However , the molecular function of formins is not known . All formins tested interact with the actin - monomer - bind - ing protein profilin , and in yeast , profilin is also required for the assembly of actin cables 4 , 11 . These genetic experiments suggest that formins and profilin could be components of an Arp2 / 3 - independ - ent actin assembly mechanism that is required for the formation of a subset of actin cytoskeletal structures . As a first step towards characterizing the biochemical function of formins , a minimal domain of Bni1 was defined as sufficient for actin cable assembly . Different truncations of Bni1 were expressed in a yeast strain that is conditional for formin function ( bni1 - FH2 # 1 bnr1 ∆ ) 7 . Expression of a short Bni1 fragment , consisting of amino acids 1215 – 1750 ( hereafter referred to as Bni1 - mini ; Fig . 1a ) , restored actin cables in the bni1 - FH2 # 1 bnr1 ∆ strain at the non - permissive temperature ( Fig . 1b ) . As previously shown for other Bni1 truncations 4 , 7 , the ability of Bni1 - mini to restore the assembly of actin cables required both its formin homology 1 ( FH1 ) and FH2 domains ( Fig . 1b ) . The FH1 domain contains polyproline motifs that mediate binding of formins to profilin ; the molecular function of the FH2 domain is not known . Expression of Bni1 - mini also suppressed the lethality of a bni1 ∆ bnr1 ∆ strain ( Fig . 1c ) . Moreover , in wild - type cells , Bni1 - mini induced the assembly of supernumerary actin cables , in common with other activated yeast formins ( Fig . 1d ) 4 , 7 . Taken together , these findings demonstrate that Bni1 - mini is sufficient for the assembly of at least some actin cables . Although full - length Bni1 is localized to the site of polarized growth 12 , Bni1 - mini lacks the domain required for polarized local - ization and is diffusely localized throughout the cell ( Fig . 1e ) . This suggests that the polarization of yeast formins , although clearly required for optimal growth , is not essential for cell division and bud formation . Thus , it is unlikely that the only function of formins is to tether actin cables to the sites of polarized growth . We next determined if purified Bni1 - mini affected the kinetics of actin polymerization . Epitope - tagged Bni1 - mini was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified ( Fig . 2a ) . The kinetics of actin assembly in the presence or absence of Bni1 - mini was monitored in an assay containing pyrene – actin . In this assay , pyrene fluorescence increases when monomeric actin is assembled into filaments . Actin alone had typical assembly kinetics , with a lag period preceding a phase of rapid assembly ( Fig . 2b ) . After addition of Bni1 - mini to the reaction , there was a dosage - dependent increase in the rate of actin assembly and a reduction in the lag phase ( Fig . 2b ) . In con - trast to the branched networks of filaments induced by activated Arp2 / 3 complex , electron microscopy demonstrated that the actin filaments induced by Bni1 - mini were not branched ( Fig . 2c ) . Although the unbranched actin filaments induced by Bni1 - mini could in principle result from debranching of branched filaments , we think this is unlikely for the following reasons : first , Bni1 - mini - induced actin filaments are unbranched at both the 150 - s and 250 - s time points in the polymerization reaction ; second , there is robust branching of actin filaments from parallel reactions containing activated Arp2 / 3 complex at both of these time points ( Fig . 2c and data not shown ) . © 2002 Nature Publishing Group brief communications NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 4 AUGUST 2002 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 627 The FH2 domains of yeast formins are required for the assem - bly of actin cables in vivo 4 , 7 . We therefore tested whether the FH2 domain of Bni1 - mini is required to promote actin filament assem - bly in vitro . Derivatives of Bni1 - mini , containing either a deletion of the FH2 domain ( Bni1 - mini - ∆ FH2 ) or inactivating point muta - tions in the FH2 domain ( Bni1 - mini - FH2 # 1 ) 7 , were constructed and purified ( Fig . 2a ) . Both Bni1 - mini derivatives failed to activate actin assembly in vitro ( Fig . 2d ) . Thus , similar to the assembly of actin cables in vivo , the activation of actin assembly by Bni1 - mini in vitro requires a functional FH2 domain . In cells , the assembly of actin filaments is thought to proceed primarily from the barbed end . To determine if Bni1 - mini , similar - ly to the Arp2 / 3 complex 1 , promotes barbed - end actin assembly , polymerization reactions were performed with or without cytocha - lasin D ( CD ) . 100 nM CD inhibits actin assembly selectively at the barbed end 13 and , as shown in Fig . 3a , 100 nM CD inhibits actin assembly induced by Bni1 - mini . Similarly , we found that actin assembly promoted by Bni1 - mini was inhibited by cytochalasin B , which also inhibits barbed - end actin assembly ( data not shown ) 14 . Furthermore , Bni1 - mini , in common with the activated Arp2 / 3 complex , promotes actin assembly in the presence of 10 µ M profil - in ( Fig . 3b ) . This high concentration of profilin blocks pointed end actin polymerization 15 , confirming that Bni1 - mini promotes barbed - end actin assembly . In principal , the acceleration of actin assembly by Bni1 - mini could reflect actin nucleation or the severing of actin filaments 1 – 3 . Two observations suggest that Bni1 - mini does not promote actin assembly by severing actin filaments : first , the kinetics of actin polymerization induced by Bni1 - mini are not characteristic of those obtained with known severing proteins 16 ; second , unlike the severing protein cofilin 2 , Bni1 - mini did not increase the rate of dis - assembly of preformed actin filaments ( Fig . 3c ) . Together , our data suggest that Bni1 - mini promotes the nucleation of actin filaments . Next , we tested if there was a functional interaction between Bni1 - mini and the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro . Addition of Bni1 - mini and yeast Arp2 / 3 complex to the reaction seemed to have an addi - tive , not synergistic , effect on the initial rate of actin assembly ( Fig . 3d ) . This suggests that Bni1 - mini and Arp2 / 3 independently promote actin assembly in vitro . Whether these two mechanisms can be integrated in vivo remains to be determined .

There are several potential explanations for this observation . First , we do not know if Bni1 - mini functions as a monomer or as a multimer ; second , we have characterized a recombinant fragment of Bni1 that might not have the same activity as the native protein or protein complex . Because all formins tested interact with profilin through pro - line - rich motifs in the FH1 domain 10 , we tested whether purified yeast profilin affected actin assembly in the presence of Bni1 - mini . As expected , profilin inhibited spontaneous actin nucleation and nucleation mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3b ) 17 . In contrast to its inhibitory effect on Arp2 / 3 - complex - mediated actin assem - bly , profilin induced a dose - dependent stimulation of actin assem - bly in the presence of Bni1 - mini ( Fig . 4a ) . In addition , at a fixed concentration of profilin ( 500 nM ) , there was a dose - dependent stimulation of actin assembly with increasing concentrations of Bni1 - mini ( Fig . 4b ) . The main effect of profilin was to shorten the lag phase of polymerization ( Fig . 4a , also see inset ) . In contrast to the stimulation of actin nucleation observed with 10 – 500 nM pro - filin , a high concentration of profilin ( 10 µ M ) had a small net inhibitory effect on actin assembly induced by Bni1 - mini ( Fig . 3b ) . This is likely to be caused by the inhibitory effect of high concen - trations of profilin on actin nucleation , as discussed above . The abilities of profilin to bind actin and polyproline are the only profilin functions known to be essential in vivo 11 , 18 , 19 . However , the cellular function of binding to polyproline is unclear . Therefore , we tested if the ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae profil - in ( Pfy1 ) to bind polyproline , and therefore its ability to bind formins , was required for profilin to stimulate actin nucleation through Bni1 - mini . The Schizosaccharomyces pombe profilin mutant Y120D folds properly , binds actin with similar affinity to the wild - type protein and exhibits normal nucleotide exchange activity on actin , but its affinity for poly - L - proline is significantly reduced ( 3 % of wild type ) 18 .

As expected , the ability of Pfy1 - 19 to bind Bni1 - mini is at least tenfold reduced by comparison with wild - type profilin ( Fig . 4c ) . Similarly to wild - type profilin , Pfy1 - 19 inhibited spontaneous actin nucleation ( Fig . 4d ) , indicating that it binds normally to actin monomers . However , unlike wild - type profilin , Pfy1 - 19 failed to enhance Bni1 - mini - stimulated actin assembly ( Fig . 4d ) . In fact , the rate of Bni1 - mini - induced actin assembly is slower in the presence of Pfy1 - 19 , an effect most apparent at high concentrations of Pfy1 - 19 ( Fig . 4e ) . Therefore , Pfy1 - 19 uncouples the two opposing effects that we observed for wild - type profilin : stimulation of Bni1 - mini’s ability to nucleate actin filaments versus suppression of spontaneous actin polymerization . Together , our data suggest that maximal actin nucleation by Bni1 - mini requires the formation of a Bni1 - mini – profilin complex . Next , we tested if the binding of profilin to actin was required to enhance Bni1 - mini - dependent actin nucleation . To accomplish this , we used a profilin mutant that binds normally to polyproline but does not have detectable actin binding ( Pfy1 - 4 ) 19 . As previous - ly described , Pfy1 - 4 did not inhibit spontaneous actin assembly 19 , and unlike wild - type profilin , Pfy1 - 4 failed to stimulate Bni1 - mini - induced actin assembly ( Fig . 4d ) . Thus , the activities that are essential for profilin function in vivo , that is , actin and polyproline binding , are both required to enhance formin - dependent actin nucleation in vitro . The experiments described here identify a new mechanism for actin filament nucleation that is mediated by the formin Bni1 , and profilin . Formins are required for cytokinesis , cell polarity and morphogenesis in many cell types .

As previously shown for the Arp2 / 3 complex 1 – 3 , we demon - strate that Bni1 is a nucleator of actin filaments with a clear role in promoting actin assembly in vivo . However , the kinetics of actin assembly induced by Bni1 - mini are distinct from those induced by activated Arp2 / 3 complex . Activated Arp2 / 3 complex both short - ens the lag phase of polymerization and produces a sharp rise in the slope of actin polymerization curves ( Fig . 3b ) 1 , 3 , 20 , 21 . These kinetics reflect the fact that the Arp2 / 3 complex seems to leave the barbed ends of new filaments free , and that Arp2 / 3 complex activ - ity is stimulated by binding to the sides of actin filaments during the course of polymerization . By contrast , the maximal rate of actin filament assembly induced by Bni1 - mini is reached early in the time course , and then slowly diminishes ( Figs 2 and 3b ) . We do not yet know the underlying mechanism that accounts for these differences . However , a recent study reported the localization of a Bni1 fragment containing the FH1 and FH2 domains to the barbed ends of actin filaments 22 . This study also reported a decrease in the elongation rate of preformed actin filaments in the presence of the Bni1 fragment . We have observed that Bni1 - mini slightly reduces the rate of disassembly of preformed actin fila - ments when actin filament depolymerization is induced by latrun - culin A ( data not shown ) . Together , these findings suggest that Bni1 might partially cap the barbed end of actin filaments . Our kinetic data are consistent with this model , but are also consistent with a model in which Bni1 binds along the sides of actin filaments during nucleation . Whatever the specific mechanism , the most pronounced effect of Bni1 is to shorten the lag phase , suggesting that Bni1 - mini either directly stabilizes polymerization intermedi - a b c 0 500 1000 0 0 . 5 2 . 5 3 2 1 . 5 1 Actin alone 500 nM Pfy1 500 nM Pfy1 + 50 nM Bni1 - mini 500 nM Pfy1 + 250 nM Bni1 - mini 500 nM Pfy1 + 500 nM Bni1 - mini 500 nM Pfy1 + 670 nM Bni1 - mini Time ( sec ) 0 . 5 2 . 5 3 2 1 . 5 1 3 . 5 4 4 . 5 00 Time ( sec ) Actin alone 100 nM Bni1 - mini 100 nM Bni1 - mini + 10 nM Pfy1 100 nM Bni1 - mini + 100 nM Pfy1 100 nM Bni1 - mini + 500 nM Pfy1 500 1000 1 . 8 2 . 0 1 . 6 1 . 4 1 . 2 1 100 200 0 0 . 8 d e 0 Time ( sec ) 0 500 1000 0 0 . 5 2 . 5 3 2 1 . 5 1 3 . 5 Actin alone 5 µ M Pfy1 - 19 5 µ M Pfy1 200 nM Bni1 - mini 200 nM Bni1 - mini + 5 µ M Pfy1 200 nM Bni1 - mini + 5 µ M Pfy1 - 19 Actin alone 500 nM Pfy1 - 19 500 nM Pfy1 500 nM Pfy1 - 4 200 nM Bni1 - mini 200 nM Bni1 - mini + 500 nM Pfy1 200 nM Bni1 - mini + 500 nM Pfy1 - 19 200 nM Bni1 - mini + 500 nM Pfy1 - 4 0 . 6 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 2 1 0 . 8 1 . 8 2 2 . 2 0 0 . 4 Time ( sec ) 250 500 2 . 4 2 . 6 Coomassie Anti - Pfy1 Anti - Pfy1 Load IP IP – Bni1 - mini + Bni1 - mini P f y 1 P f y 1 - 19 P f y 1 P f y 1 - 19 F l uo r e sc en c e ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s × 10 3 ) F l uo r e sc en c e ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s × 10 3 ) F l uo r e sc en c e ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s × 10 3 ) F l uo r e sc en c e ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s × 10 3 ) Figure 4 Profilin enhances Bni1 - mini - induced actin assembly . a , Dose - depend - ent stimulation of Bni1 - mini - induced actin assembly by profilin .

The in vivo role of profilin binding to proline - rich ligands , such as formins , has not been defined . However , binding of profilin to these ligands is suggested to promote actin assembly at specific mem - brane sites 10 . Here , we provide biochemical evidence for this model by showing that profilin stimulates Bni1 - mini - induced actin nucle - ation . Our analysis of profilin mutants suggests that this stimulatory effect requires the ability of profilin to bind to actin and polyproline motifs in Bni1 - mini . Addition of actin monomers to the free barbed end is a diffusion - limited process 23 . However , if Bni1 - mini partially caps the barbed - end during elongation , then diffusion may no longer be limiting and Bni1 - mini binding to profilin may be important for the recruitment of actin monomers to the barbed end for assembly . Alternatively , binding to a profilin – actin complex may induce a con - formational change in Bni1 - mini that favours nucleation . It is interesting to consider why cells would need more than one mechanism for actin nucleation . Genetic experiments suggest that different actin assembly systems are dedicated to the construction of distinct actin structures 4 – 8 . Whereas the assembly of yeast actin patch - es specifically requires activated Arp2 / 3 complex , the assembly of actin cables specifically requires formins and profilin 6 . Intriguingly , the mammalian formin mDia promotes the formation of actin stress fibres that are linear structures , similar to yeast actin cables 24 – 26 . Thus , formins may have a specific role in the assembly of linear actin struc - tures . Our finding that Bni1 - mini induces the assembly of linear , not branched , actin filaments in vitro supports this idea . The Arp2 / 3 com - plex may nucleate actin for structures primarily composed of branched filaments , whereas the formin – profilin complex nucleates actin for structures primarily composed of linear filaments . Thus , dis - tinct actin nucleation mechanisms might provide a basis for assem - bling differently shaped actin cytoskeletal structures .

PY4315 ( MATahis3 ∆ 1 leu2 ∆ 0 ura3 ∆ 0 met15 ∆ 0 bni1 : : KanR bnr1 : : HIS3 { URA3 2µ BNI1 } ) is a derivative of the Research Genetics strain number1173 . The details of plasmid and strain constructions are available on request . Imaging Alexa - 568 – phalloidin staining , imaging and three - dimensional reconstruction of fixed cells were per - formed as previously described 7 . The preparation of samples for transmission electron microscopy was performed as previously described 27 . Biochemical methods For biochemical characterization , the coding sequence of Flag - tagged Bni1 - mini and the FH2 domain mutants , were cloned into pET11 - d ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . Bni1 - mini FH2 # 1 contains the amino acid substitutions R313A and R315A ( corresponding to substitutions R1528A and R1530A in Bni1 ( ref . 7 ) ) . These constructs were overexpressed in E . coli BL21 - CodonPlus ( DE3 ) - RP ( Stratagene ) . Cells were suspended in HEK buffer ( 20mM Hepes at pH7 . 5 , 1mM EDTA and 50mM potassium chlo - ride ) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) and lysed by sonication . A high - speed supernatant was generated and incubated with an Anti - Flag M2 affinity gel ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) . Elution was performed with 200 µ gml − 1 Flag Peptide ( Sigma ) . The recombi - nant proteins were further purified by fractionation on a 1 - ml Mono - Q column ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) . Fractions containing either Bni1 - mini or the FH2 domain mutants were then dialysed against HEK buffer supplemented with 5 % glycerol . Yeast Arp2 / 3 complex , recombinant WA ( WASp homology 2 domain and acidic domain ) fragment of Las17 / Bee1 , and yeast profilins were purified as described 19 , 28 , 29 For immunoprecipitation , high - speed supernatants of crude E . coli extracts were incubated for 2h at 4 ° C with Anti - Flag M2 Affinity Gel in HEK buffer containing 250mM potassium chloride in the pres - ence of 10 µ M Pfy1 or Pfy1 - 19 . After extensive washes , the proteins bound to beads were eluted with 200 µ gml − 1 Flag peptide . To detect profilin , guinea pig antibodies against yeast profilin ( kindly provided by D . Drubin ) were used at a final dilution of 1 : 250 before incubation with secondary peroxidase - cou - pled anti - guinea pig antibodies ( Sigma ) and detection by ECL ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Actin polymerization assays Actin polymerization was monitored by the increase in fluorescence of 1 % pyrenyl - labelled rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( 50 µ M ; Cytoskeleton ) in G - buffer ( 10mM Tris - HCl at pH7 . 5 , 0 . 2mM calcium chloride , 0 . 2mM dithiothreitol and 0 . 2mM ATP ) was thawed overnight at 4 ° C , diluted to 22 . 5 µ M in G - buffer and pre - cleared by centrifugation at 350 , 000 g for 45min at 4 ° C in a TLA100 rotor . Actin was mixed with test proteins and the reaction was initiated by transfer to a quartz fluorometer cuvette ( 3 - mm light path ) containing 20 × initiation mix ( 40mM magnesium chloride , 1M potassium chloride and 10mM ATP ) . Pyrene fluorescence was recorded at 407nm with an excitation at 365nm at a constant temperature of 25 ° C . For actin disas - sembly assays , Bni1 - mini or yeast cofilin were incubated for 5min in the presence of pre - assembled actin filaments ( 3 . 5 µ M ) . Disassembly was induced by dilution in F - buffer ( G - buffer containing 1 × initiation mix ) to a final concentration of 0 . 35 µ M .
