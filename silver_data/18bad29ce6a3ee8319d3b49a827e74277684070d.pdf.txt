Editor’s Note . This article is the JBES 1999 Invited Lecture at the Joint Statistical Meetings , August 1999 , in Baltimore , Maryland . Estimation of Limited Dependent Variable Models With Dummy Endogenous Regressors : Simple Strategies for Empirical Practice Joshua D . Angrist Department of Economics , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , MA 02142 - 1347 , and National Bureau of Economic Research , Cambridge , MA ( angrist @ mit . edu ) Applied economists have long struggled with the question of how to accommodate binary endogenous regressors in models with binary and nonnegativeoutcomes . Iargue here that much of the dif(cid:142) culty with limited dependent variables comes from a focus on structural parameters , such as index coef(cid:142) cients , instead of causal effects . Once the object of estimation is taken to be the causal effect of treatment , several simple strategies are available . These include conventionaltwo - stage least squares , multiplicative models for conditional means , linear approximation of nonlinear causal models , models for distribution effects , and quantile regression with an endogenous binary regressor . The estimation strategies discussed in the article are illustrated by using multiple births to estimate the effect of childbearing on employment status and hours of work . KEY WORDS : Instrumental variables ; Labor supply ; Sample selection ; Semiparametric methods ; Tobit . Econometric models with dummy endogenous regressors capture the causal relationship between a binary regressor and an outcome variable . A canonical example is the evaluation of training programs , in which the binary regressor is an indica - tor for those who were trained and outcomes are earnings and employment status . Other examples include treatment effects in epidemiology and health economics , effects of union sta - tus , and the effects of teen childbearing on schooling or labor - market outcomes . All of these problems have a treatment - control (cid:143) avor . The notion that treatment status is “endoge - nous” re(cid:143) ects the fact that simple comparisons of treated and untreated individuals are unlikely to have a causal interpreta - tion . Instead , the dummy endogenous - variable model is meant to allow for the possibility of joint determination of outcomes and treatment status or omitted variables related to both treat - ment status and outcomes . The principal challenge facing empirical researchers con - ducting studies of this type is identi(cid:142) cation . Successful identi(cid:142) cation in this context usually means (cid:142) nding an instru - mental variable ( IV ) that affects outcomes solely through its impact on the binary regressor of interest . For better or worse , however , the formal discipline of econometrics is not much concerned with the “(cid:142) nding instruments problem” ; this is a job left to the imagination of empirical researchers . This divi - sion of responsibility reminds me a little of Steve Martin’s old joke about “how to make a million dollars and never pay taxes . ” First , Martin blandly suggests , “get a million dollars . ” In the same spirit , once you have solved the dif(cid:142) cult prob - lem of (cid:142) nding an instrument , then the tasks of estimation and inference—typically using two - stage least squares ( 2SLS ) — look relatively straightforward . But perhaps there is reason to worry about estimation and inference in this context after all . Even with a plausible instru - ment , the dummy endogenous - variables model still seems to raise some special econometric problems . For one thing , the endogenous regressor is binary , so perhaps a nonlinear (cid:142) rst stage is in order . Second , and more importantly , in many cases the outcome of interest is also binary . Examples include employment status in the evaluation of training programs and survival status in health research . In other cases , the depen - dent variable has limited support , most often being nonnega - tive with a mass point at 0 . Examples of this sort of outcome include earnings , hours worked , and expenditure on health care . The analysis of such limited dependent variables ( LDV’s ) seems to call for nonlinear models like probit and tobit . This generates few stumbling blocks when the regressors are exoge - nous , but , with endogenous regressors , LDV models appear to present special challenges . This article argues that dif(cid:142) culties with endogenous vari - ables in nonlinear LDV models are usually more apparent than real . For binary endogenous regressors , at least , the techni - cal challenges posed by LDV models come primarily from what I see as a counterproductive focus on structural param - eters such as latent index coef(cid:142) cients or censored regression coef(cid:142) cients , instead of directly interpretable causal effects . In my view , the problem of causal inference with LDV’s is not © 2001 American Statistical Association Journal of Business & Economic Statistics January 2001 , Vol . 19 , No . 1 2 Angrist : Estimation of Limited Dependent Variables Models With Dummy Endogenous Regressors 3 fundamentally different from causal inference with continuous outcomes . Section 1 begins by discussing identi(cid:142) cation strategies in LDV models with dummy endogenous regressors . I show that the auxiliary assumptions associated with structural model - ing are largely unnecessary for causal inference . There is one important exception to this claim , however , and that is when attention focuses on conditional - on - positive effects , as in sample - selection models . For example , labor economists sometimes study the effect of an endogenous treatment on hours worked for those who work . Identi(cid:142) cation of such effects turns heavily on an underlying structural framework . On the other hand , the motivation for estimating this sort of effect is often unclear ( to me ) . Moreover , claims for identi(cid:142) - cation in this context typically strike me as overly ambitious because even an ideal randomized experiment fails to identify conditional - on - positive causal effects . Setting aside the conceptual problems inherent in conditional - on - positive effects , a focus on causal effects instead of , say , censored regression parameters or latent index coef(cid:142) cients has a major practical payoff . First and most basic is the observation that if there are no covariates or the covari - ates are sparse and discrete , linear models and associated esti - mation techniques like 2SLS are no less appropriate for LDV’s than for other kinds of dependent variables . This is because conditional expectation functions with discrete covariates can be parameterized as linear using a saturated model , regardless of the support of the dependent variable . Of course , relation - ships involving continuous covariates or a less - than - saturated parameterization for discrete covariates are usually nonlin - ear ( even if the outcome variable has continuous support ) . In such cases , however , it still makes sense to ask whether nonlinear modeling strategies change inferences about causal effects . If nonlinearity does seem important , it can be incorpo - rated into models for conditional means using two new semi - parametric estimators . The (cid:142) rst , due to Mullahy ( 1997 ) , is based on a multiplicative model that can be estimated using a simple nonlinear IV estimator . The second , developed by Abadie ( 1999 ) , allows (cid:143) exible nonlinear approximation of the causal response function of interest . In addition to new strategies for estimating effects on means , I also discuss estimates of the effect of treatment on distribution ordi - nates and quantiles using an approach developed by Abadie , Angrist , and Imbens ( 1998 ) . This provides an alternative to the estimation of conditional - on - positive effects . Two advan - tages of these new approaches are their computational sim - plicity and weak identi(cid:142) cation requirements relative to other semiparametric approaches . Another advantage is the fact that they estimate causal effects directly and are not tied to a latent - index / censored - regression framework . The new estima - tors are illustrated by estimating the effect of childbearing on women’s employment status and hours of work using multi - ple births as an instrument . This “twins instrument” was used to estimate the labor - supply consequences of childbearing by Rosenzweig and Wolpin ( 1980 ) , Bronars and Grogger ( 1994 ) , Gangadharan and Rosenbloom ( 1996 ) , and Angrist and Evans ( 1998 ) . 1 . CAUSAL EFFECTS AND STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS 1 . 1 The Effects of Interest The relationship between fertility and labor supply is of longstanding interest in labor economics and demography . For a recent discussion and references to the literature , see Angrist and Evans ( 1998 ) , which is the basis of the empirical work in Section 4 . The Angrist – Evans application is concerned with the effect of going from a family size of two children to more than two children . Let D i be an indicator for women with more than two children in a sample of women with at least two children . The reasons for focusing on the transition from two to more than two are both practical and substantive . First , on the practical side , there are plausible instruments available for this fertility increment . Second , recent reductions in martial fertility have been concentrated in the 2 – 3 child range . What is the object of interest in an application like this ? Sometimes the purpose of research is merely descriptive , in which case we might simply compare the outcomes of women who have D i D 1 with those of women who have D i D 0 . For this descriptive agenda , no special issues are raised by the fact that the dependent variable is limited , beyond the obvi - ous consideration that if Y i is binary , then one need only look at means . In contrast , if Y i is a variable like earnings with a skewed distribution , the mean may not capture everything about labor - supply behavior that is of interest . In fact , a com - plete description would probably look at the entire distribution of outcomes , or at least at selected quantiles . A major problem with descriptive analyses is that they may have little predictive value . Part of the motivation for studying labor supply and fertility is interest in how changes in gov - ernment policy and the environment affect childbearing and labor supply . For example , we might be interested in the con - sequences of changes in contraceptive technology or costs , a motivation for studying the twins experiment mentioned by Rosenzweig and Wolpin ( 1980 , p . 347 ) . Similarly , one of the questions addressed in the labor - supply literature is to what extent declines in fertility have been a causal factor increas - ing female employment rates or reducing poverty . In contrast with descriptive analyses , causal relationships answer counter - factual questions and are therefore more likely to be of value for predicting the effects of changing policies or changing cir - cumstances or understanding the past ( e . g . , see Manski 1996 ) . Causal relationships can be described most simply using explicit notation for counterfactuals or potential outcomes . This approach to causal inference goes back at least to R . A . Fisher , but the modern version is usually attributed to Rubin ( 1974 , 1977 ) . Let Y 1 i denote the labor - market behavior of mother i if she has a third child , and let Y 0 i denote labor - market behavior otherwise for the same mother . The average effect of childbearing on mothers who have a third child is E6Y 1 i — D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y 0 i — D i D 1 7 D E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — D i D 1 70 ( 1 ) Note that the (cid:142) rst term on the left side is observed , but the second term is an unobserved counterfactual average that we assume is meaningful . The right side of ( 1 ) is often called the effect of treatment on the treated , and is widely discussed in the evaluation literature 4 Journal of Business & Economic Statistics , January 2001 ( e . g . , Rubin 1977 ; Heckman and Robb 1985 ; Angrist 1998 ) . In the context of social - program evaluation , the effect of treat - ment on the treated tells us whether the program was bene(cid:142) cial for participants . This is not the only average effect of interest ; we might also care about the unconditional average effect or the effect in some subpopulation de(cid:142) ned by covariates ( i . e . , E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — X7 for covariates , X ) . Ultimately , of course , we are also likely to want to extrapolate from the experiences of the treated to as - yet - untreated groups . Such extrapolation makes little sense , however , unless average causal effects in existing populations can be reliably assessed . Simple comparisons of outcomes by D i generally fail to identify causal effects . Rather , a comparison between treated and untreated individuals equals the effect of treatment on the treated plus a bias term : E6Y i — D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y i — D i D 1 7 D E6Y 1 i — D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y 0 i — D i D 0 7 D E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — D i D 1 7 C 8E6Y 0 i — D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y 0 i — D i D 0 790 ( 2 ) The bias term disappears in the childbearing example if child - bearing is determined in a manner independent of a woman’s potential labor - market behavior if she does not have children . In that case , 8E6Y 0 i — D i D 0 7 ƒ E6Y 0 i — D i D 1 79 D 0 , and simple comparisons identify the effect of treatment on the treated . But this independence assumption seems unrealistic because childbearing decisions are made in light of information about earnings potential and career plans . 1 . 2 Structural Models What connects the causal parameters discussed in the pre - vious section with the parameters in structural economet - ric models ? Suppose that , instead of potential outcomes , we begin with a labor - supply model for hours worked , along the lines of many second - generation labor - supply studies ( see Killingsworth 1983 for a survey ) . In this setting , childbearing is determined by comparing the utility of having a child and not having a child . We can model this process as D i D 1 4X 0 i ƒ > ‡ i 51 ( 3a ) where X i is a K (cid:128) 1 vector of observed characteristics that determine utility and ‡ i is an unobserved variable re(cid:143) ecting a person - speci(cid:142) c utility contrast . In a simple static model , labor supply is given by the com - bination of the participation decision and hours determination for workers . Workers chose their latent hours 4y i 5 by equat - ing offered wages , w i , with the marginal rate of substitution of goods for leisure , m i 4y i 5 . Participation is determined by the relationship between w i and the marginal rate of substitu - tion at zero hours , m i 4 0 5 . Since offered wages are unobserved for nonworkers and reservation wages are never observed , we decompose these variables into a linear function of observable characteristics and regression error terms ( denoted v wi 1 v mi ) , as in the article by Heckman ( 1974 ) and many others : w i D X 0 i „ w C (cid:157) w D i C v wi ( 3b ) and m i 4y i 5 D X 0 i „ m C – y i C (cid:157) m D i C v mi 0 ( 3c ) Equating ( 3b ) and ( 3c ) and relabeling parameters and the error term , we can solve for observed hours : Y i D X 0 i „ C (cid:157)D i C ˜ i if w i > m i 4 0 5 Y i D 0 otherwise 0 Equivalently , Y i D 1 4X 0 i „ C (cid:157)D i > ƒ ˜ i 54X 0 i „ C (cid:157)D i C ˜ i 50 ( 4 ) Childbearing is said to be endogenous if the unobserved error determining D i depends on the unobserved error in the partic - ipation and hours equations . Since the structural equations tell us what a woman would do under alternative values of D i , they describe the same sort of potential outcomes referred to in the previous model . The explicit link is Y i D Y 0 i 4 1 ƒ D i 5 C Y 1 i D i 1 ( 5 ) where Y 0 i D 1 4X 0 i „ > ƒ ˜ i 54X 0 i „ C ˜ i 5 ( 6a ) and Y 1 i D 1 4X 0 i „ C (cid:157) > ƒ ˜ i 54X 0 i „ C (cid:157) C ˜ i 50 ( 6b ) Once the structural parameters are known , we can use these relationships to write down expressions for causal effects . For example , the effect of treatment on the treated is E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — D i D 1 7 D E 1 4X 0 i „ C (cid:157) > ƒ ˜ i 54X 0 i „ C (cid:157) C ˜ i 5 ƒ 1 4X 0 i „ > ƒ ˜ i 54X 0 i „ C ˜ i 5 — X 0 i ƒ > ‡ i 90 ( 7 ) Note , however , that knowledge of the parameters on the right side of ( 7 ) is still not enough to evaluate this expression . The following lemma outlines the identi(cid:142) cation possibilities in this context : Lemma . Assume that the covariates 4X i 5 are independent of continuously distributed latent errors , 4‡ i 1˜ i 5 . Then 1 . If ‡ i is not independent of ˜ i , and the probability of treatment is always nonzero , the effect of treatment on the treated is not identi(cid:142) ed without further assumptions ( Heckman 1990 ) . 2 . If ‡ i is independent of ˜ i , the effect of treatment on the treated is identi(cid:142) ed ( exogenous treatment ) . Angrist : Estimation of Limited Dependent Variables Models With Dummy Endogenous Regressors 5 3 . Suppose there is a covariate , denoted Z i , with coef(cid:142) cient ƒ 1 in ( 3a ) , which is excluded from ( 3b ) and ( 3c ) . Without loss of generality , assume ƒ 1 > 0 . Then the local average treatment effect ( LATE ) given by E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — X 0 i ƒ C ƒ 1 > ‡ i > X 0 i ƒ7 is identi(cid:142) ed ( Imbens and Angrist 1994 ) . 4 . Suppose that LATE is identi(cid:142) ed as in 3 and that P6D i D 1 — Z i D 0 7 D 0 . Then LATE equals the effect of treatment on the treated , E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — D i D 1 7 . Similarly , if P6D i D 1 — Z i D 1 7 D 1 , LATE equals E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — D i D 0 7 ( Angrist and Imbens 1991 ) . This set of results can easily be summarized using non - technical language . First , without additional assumptions , the effect of treatment on the treated is not identi(cid:142) ed in latent - index models . Second , the three positive identi(cid:142) cation results in the lemma , for exogeneous treatment , the LATE result , and the specialization of LATE to effects on the treated or nontreated , require no information about the structural model other than the distribution of D and Z . On the other hand , the LATE result for endogenous treatments in part 3 does not gen - erally refer to the effect of treatment on the treated , so here the role played by the structural model in identifying causal effects merits further discussion . The treatment effect captures the effect of treatment on the treated for those whose treatment status is changed by the instrument , Z i . The data are informative about the effect of treatment on these people because the instrument changes their behavior . Thus , an exclusion restriction is enough to identify causal effects for a group directly affected by the “experi - ment” at hand . ( Angrist , Imbens , and Rubin 1996 called these people compliers . ) In some cases this is the set of all treated individuals , while in other cases this is only a subset . In any case , however , this result provides a foundation for credible causal inference because the assumptions needed for this nar - row “identi(cid:142) cation - in - principle” can be separated from mod - eling assumptions required for smoothing and extrapolation to other groups of interest . The quality of this extrapolation is , of course , an open question and undoubtedly differs across appli - cations . In my experience , however , often estimates of LATE differ little from estimates based on the stronger assumptions invoked to identify effects on the entire treated population . ( Of course , I have to admit that , when simple and sophisticated estimation strategies do differ , I invariably prefer the simple ! For an illustration of why this is , see the example that fol - lows . ) Although extrapolation is an important part of what empir - ical researchers do , parameters like LATE and the effect of treatment on the treated provide a minimum - controversy jumping - off point for inference and prediction . Structural parameters are sometimes more closely linked to economic theory than average causal effects . But the ultimate goal of theory - motivated structural estimation seems to differ little from the causal agenda . For example , Keane and Wolpin ( 1997 , p . 111 ) used structural models to “forecast the behavior of agents given any change in the state of the world that can be characterized as a change in their constraints . ” A prereq - uisite for this is credible assessment of causal effects of past changes . Structural parameters that are not linked to causal effects are not useful for this basic purpose [ Mullahy ( 1998 ) made a similar point ] . The rest of my discussion is therefore limited to models in which the effects of interest are de(cid:142) ned directly in terms of potential outcomes . 2 . CAUSAL EFFECTS ON LDV’s 2 . 1 Average Effects in Experimental Data Does the fact that a dependent variable is binary or non - negative have any implications for empirical causal analysis ? A useful starting point for this discussion is the analysis of randomized experiments , since some of the issues raised by the presence of LDV’s have nothing to do with endogeneity . Suppose that D i was randomly assigned , or at least assigned by some mechanism that ensures independence between D i and Y 0 i . In this case , a simple difference in means between those with D i D 1 and with D i D 0 identi(cid:142) es the effect of treat - ment on the treated : E6Y i — D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y i — D i D 0 7 D E6Y 1 i — D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y 0 i — D i D 0 7 D E6Y 1 i — D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y 0 i — D i D 1 7 4 by independence of Y 0 i and D i 5 D E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — D i D 1 7 4 by linearity of conditional means 50 ( 8 ) If D i is also independent of Y 1 i , as would be likely in an exper - iment , then E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — D i D 1 7 D E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i 7 , the uncondi - tional average treatment effect . ( Usually this “unconditional” average still refers to a subpopulation eligible to participate in the experiment . ) Equation ( 8 ) shows that the estimation of causal effects in experiments presents no special challenges whether Y i is binary , nonnegative , or continuously distributed . If Y i is binary , then the difference in means on the left side of ( 8 ) cor - responds to a difference in probabilities , while if Y i has a mass point at 0 , the difference in means is the difference in E6Y i — Y i > 0 1D i 7P6Y i > 0 — D i 7 . But these facts have no bearing on the causal interpretation of estimates or , in the absence of further assumptions or restrictions , the choice of estimators . 2 . 2 Conditional - on - Positive Effects In many studies with nonnegative dependent variables , researchers are interested in effects in a subset of the popula - tion with positive outcomes . Interest in conditional - on - positive effects is sometimes motivated by the following decompo - sition of differences in means , discussed by McDonald and Mof(cid:142) t ( 1980 ) : E6Y i — D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y i — D i D 0 7 D 8P6Y i > 0 — D i D 1 7 ƒ P6Y > 0 — D i D 0 79 (cid:128) E6Y i — Y i > 0 1D i D 1 7 C 8E6Y i — Y i > 0 1D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y i — Y i > 0 1 D i D 0 79 (cid:128) P6Y > 0 — D i D 0 70 ( 9 ) 6 Journal of Business & Economic Statistics , January 2001 This decomposition describes how much of the overall treatment - control difference is due to participation effects ( i . e . , the impact on 1 6Y i > 0 7 ) and how much is due to an increase in intensity for those with Y i > 0 . For a recent example of this distinction , see Evans , Farrelly , and Montgomery ( 1999 ) , who analyzed the impact of workplace smoking restrictions on smoking participation and intensity . In an experimental setting , the interpretation of the (cid:142) rst part of ( 9 ) as giving the causal effect of treatment on participation is straightforward . Does the conditional - on - positive difference in the second part also have a straightforward interpretation ? The large literature constrasting two - part and sample - selection models for LDV’s suggests not . ( See , for example , Duan , Manning , Morris , and Newhouse 1984 ; Hay and Olsen 1984 ; Hay , Leu , and Roher 1987 ; Leung and Yu 1996 ; Maddala 1985 ; Manning , Duan , and Rogers 1987 ; Mullahy 1998 . ) To analyze the conditional - on - positive comparison further , it is useful to write the mean difference by treatment status as follows ( still assuming Y 0 i and D i are independent ) : E6Y i — Y i > 0 1D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y i — Y i > 0 1 D i D 0 7 D E6Y 1 i — Y 1 i > 0 1D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y 0 i — Y 0 i > 0 1D i D 0 7 D E6Y 1 i — Y 1 i > 0 1D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y 0 i — Y 0 i > 0 1D i D 1 7 D E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — Y 1 i > 0 1D i D 1 7 ( 10a ) C 8E6Y 0 i — Y 1 i > 0 1D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y 0 i > 0 1D i D 1 790 ( 10b ) On one hand , ( 10a ) suggests that the conditional contrast estimates a potentially interesting effect , since this clearly amounts to a statement about the impact of treatment on the distribution of potential outcomes ( in fact , this is something like a comparison of hazard rates ) . On the other hand , from ( 10b ) , it is clear that a conditional - on - working comparison does not tell us how much of the overall treatment effect is due to an increase in work among treated workers . The prob - lem is that the conditional contrast involves different groups of people—those with Y 1 i > 0 and those with Y 0 i > 0 . Suppose , for example , that the treatment effect is a positive constant , say , Y 1 i D Y 0 i C (cid:129) . Since the second term in ( 10b ) must then be negative , the observed difference , E6Y i — Y i > 0 7 ƒ E6Y i — Y i > 0 7 , is clearly less than the causal effect on treated workers , which is (cid:129) in the constant - effects model . This is the selectivity - bias problem (cid:142) rst noted by Gronau ( 1974 ) and Heckman ( 1974 ) . In principle , tobit and sample - selection models can be used to eliminate selectivity bias in conditional - on - positive com - parisons . These models depict Y i as the censored observation of an underlying continuously distributed latent variable . Sup - pose , for example , that Y i D 1 6Y i > 0 7Y ü i 1 where Y ü i D Y ü 01 C 4Y ü 1 i ƒ Y ü 0 i 5D i D Y ü 0 i C D i (cid:129)0 ( 11 ) Recent studies with this type of censoring in a female labor - supply model are those of Blundell and Smith ( 1989 ) and Lee ( 1995 ) , both of which include endogeneous regressors . Note that in this context the constant - effects causal model is applied to the latent variable , not the observed outcome . Under a variety of distributional assumptions [ e . g . , normal - ity , as in Heckman ( 1974 ) or weaker assumptions like sym - metry , as in Powell ( 1986a ) ] , the parameter (cid:129) is identi(cid:142) ed . But what is the interpretation of (cid:129) in a causal model ? One possible answer is that (cid:129) is the causal effect of D i on Y ü i 1 though Y ü i is not observed , so this is not usually of intrinsic interest . However , a direct calculation using ( 11 ) shows that (cid:129) is also a conditional - on - positive causal effect ( for details , see the appendix ) . In particular , (cid:129) D E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — Y 1 i > 0 7 if (cid:129) < 0 ( 12a ) and (cid:129) D E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — Y 1 i > 0 7 if (cid:129) > 0 0 ( 12b ) Thus , the censored - regression model does succeed in sepa - rating causal effects from selection effects in conditional - on - positive comparisons . [ We do not know a priori whether (cid:129) is the effect in ( 12a ) or ( 12b ) , but it seems reasonable to use the sign of the estimated (cid:129) to decide . ] Although ( 11 ) provides an elegant resolution of the selection - bias dilemma , in practice I (cid:142) nd the use of censored - regression models to accomplish this unattractive . One prob - lem is conceptual . Although a censored - regression model seems natural for arti(cid:142) cially censored data ( e . g . , topcoded variables in the Current Population Survey ) , the notion of a latent labor - supply equation that can take on negative values is less clear cut . The censoring in this case comes about because some people choose to work zero hours and not because of measurement problems [ Maddala ( 1985 ) made a similar com - ment regarding Tobin’s original application ] . Here , an under - lying structural model seems essential to the interpretation of empirical results . For example , in the labor - supply model from Section 1 , the censored latent variable is the difference between unobserved offered wages and marginal rates of sub - stitution . But even assuming the effect of regressors on this difference is of interest , the latent index coef(cid:142) cients alone have no predictive value for observable quantities . Second , even if we adopt a theoretical framework that makes the latent structure meaningful , identi(cid:142) cation of a censored - regression model requires assumption beyond those needed for indenti(cid:142)cation of unconditional causal effects of the type described by ( 8 ) . Semiparametric estimators that do not rely on distributional assumptions fail here because the regressor is discrete and there are no exclusion restrictions on the selection equation ( see Chamberlain 1986 ) . Moreover , in addition to requiring distributional assumptions , identi(cid:142) cation of (cid:129) in ( 12 ) turns heavily on the additive , constant - effects model in ( 11 ) . This is because E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — Y 1 i > 0 7 involves the joint distribution of Y 1 and Y 0 . The constant - effects assump - tion nails this joint distribution down , but the data contain information on marginal distributions only ( which is why even randomized trials fail to answer the causal question that moti - vates samples - selection models ) . These concerns , echoed by many applied researchers , stim - ulated investigation of alternative strategies for the analysis of nonnegative outcomes ( e . g . , see Mof(cid:142) t’s 1999 survey ) . Angrist : Estimation of Limited Dependent Variables Models With Dummy Endogenous Regressors 7 The two - part model ( 2PM ) , introduced by Cragg ( 1971 ) , and widely used in health economics , seems to provide a less demanding framework for the analysis of LDV’s than sample - selection models . The two parts of the 2PM are P6Y i > 0 — D i 7 and E6Y i — Y i > 0 1 D i 7 . Researchers using this model simply pick a functional form for each part . For example , probit or a linear probability model might be used for the (cid:142) rst part and a linear or log - linear model might be used for the second part . Log - linearity for the second part may be desirable since this imposed nonnegativity of (cid:142) tted values ( e . g . , see Mullahy 1998 ) . One attraction of the 2PM is that it (cid:142) ts a nonlinear func - tional form to the conditional expectation function ( CEF ) for LDV’s even if both parts are linear . On the other hand , tobit - type sample - selection models (cid:142) t a nonlinear CEF as well , pro - vided there are covariates other than D i . For example , the CEF implied by ( 11 ) , with latent - index Y ü 0 i D X 0 i Œ C D i (cid:129) C ˜ i and a Normal homoscedastic error , is E6Y i — X i 1D i 7 D ê64X 0 i Œ C D i (cid:129)5 = ‘76X 0 i Œ C D i (cid:129)7 C ‘(cid:157)64X 0 i Œ C D i (cid:129)5 = ‘71 ( 13 ) where (cid:157)4 ¡ 5 and ê4 ¡ 5 are the standard Normal density and distribution functions and ‘ is the standard deviation of ˜ i ( e . g . , see McDonald and Mof(cid:142) t 1980 ) . The derivative of this CEF with respect to D i is ê64X 0 i Œ C D i (cid:129)5 = ‘7(cid:129) . The nonlinearity of ( 13 ) notwithstanding , at (cid:142) rst blush the 2PM seems to provide a more (cid:143) exible nonlinear speci(cid:142) cation than tobit or other sample - selection models . The latter imposes restrictions tied to the latent - index structure , while the two parts of the 2PM can be speci(cid:142) ed in whatever form seems convenient and (cid:142) ts the data well ( a point made by Lin and Schmidt 1984 ) . A signal feature of the 2PM , however , and the main point of contrast with sample - selection models , is that the 2PM does not attempt to solve the sample - selection problem in ( 10b ) . Thus , the second part of the 2PM does not have a clear - cut causal interpretation even if D i is randomly assigned . Similarly , and of particular relevance here , is the point that instrumental variables that are valid for estimating the effect of D i on Y i are not valid for estimating the effect of D i on Y i conditional on Y i > 0 . The 2PM therefore seems ill suited for causal inference . 2 . 3 Effects on Distributions Conditional - on - positive effects and sample - selection models are sometimes motivated by interest in the consequence of D i beyond the impact on average outcomes [ e . g . , see Eichner , McClellan , and Wise’s ( 1997 ) analysis of insurance effects on health expenditure ] . Are there schemes for estimating effects on distributions that are less demanding than sample - selection models ? Once the basic problem of identifying causal effects is resolved , the impact of D i on the distribution of outcomes is identi(cid:142) ed and can be easily estimated . To see this for the experimental ( exogenous D i ) case , note that , given the assumed independence of D i of Y 0 i , the follow - ing relationship holds for any point , c , in the support of Y i : E6 1 4Y i µ c5 — D i D 1 7 ƒ E6 1 4Y i µ c5 — D i D 0 7 D P6Y 1 i µ c — D i D 1 7 ƒ P6Y 0 i µ c — D i D 1 70 In fact , the entire marginal distributions of Y 1 i and Y 0 i are iden - ti(cid:142) ed for those with D i D 1 . So it is easy to check whether D i has an impact on the probability that Y i D 0 , as in the (cid:142) rst part of the 2PM , or whether there is a change in the distribution of outcomes at any positive value . This information is enough to make social - welfare comparisons , as long as the comparisons of interest involve marginal distributions only . 2 . 4 Covariates and Nonlinearity The conditional expectation of Y i given D i is inherently linear , as are other conditional relationships involving D i alone . Suppose , however , that identi(cid:142) cation is based on a “selection - on - observables” assumption instead of presumed random assignment . This means that causal inference is based on the presumption that Y 0 i q D i — X i 1 and causal effects must be estimated after conditioning on X i . For example , the effect of treatment on the treated can be expressed as E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — D i D 1 7 D E8E6Y 1 i — X i 1 D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y 0 i — X i 1D i D 1 7 — D i D 1 9 D Z 8E6Y 1 i — X i 1D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y 0 i — X i 1D i D 0 79 (cid:128) P4X i D x — D D 1 5dx1 ( 14 ) where P4X D x — D D 1 5 is a distribution of density . Estima - tion using the sample analog of ( 14 ) is straightforward if X i has discrete support with many observations per cell ( e . g . , see Angrist 1998 ) . Otherwise , some sort of smoothing ( model - ing ) is required to estimate the CEF’s E6Y 1 i — X i 1 D i D 1 7 and E6Y 0 i — X i 1 D i D 0 7 . Regression provides a (cid:143) exible and computationally attrac - tive smoothing device . A conceptual justi(cid:142) cation for regres - sion smoothing is that population regression coef(cid:142) cients provide the best ( minimum mean squared error ) linear approx - imation to E6Y i — X i 1D i 7 ( e . g . , see Goldberger 1991 ) . This “approximation property” holds regardless of the distribution of Y i . Separate regressions can be used to approximate E6Y 1 i — X i 1D i D 1 7 and E6Y 0 i — X i 1D i D 1 7 , though this leaves the problem of estimating P4X i D x — D D 1 5 to compute the average difference in CEF’s using ( 14 ) . On the other hand , a simple additive model—say E6Y i — X i 1 D i 7 D X 0 i ‚ r C (cid:129) r D i — sometimes works well , in the sense that (cid:129) r —the “regression estimand”—is close to average effects derived from models that allow for nonlinearity and interactions between D i and X i . With discrete covariates and a saturated model for X i , the additive model can be thought of as implicitly producing a weighted average of covariate - speci(cid:142)c contrasts . Although the regression weighting scheme differs from that in ( 14 ) , in prac - tice , treatment - effect heterogeneity may be limited enough that alternative weighting schemes have little impact on the over - all estimate ( see Angrist and Krueger 1999 for more on this point ) . 8 Journal of Business & Economic Statistics , January 2001 3 . ENDOGENOUS REGRESSORS : TRADITIONAL SOLUTIONS LDV models with endogenous regressors were (cid:142) rst esti - mated using distributional assumptions and maximum likeli - hood ( ML ) . An early and in(cid:143) uential work in this mold is that of Heckman ( 1978 ) . This approach is not wedded to ML ; Heckman ( 1978 ) , Amemiya ( 1978 , 1979 ) , Newey ( 1986 , 1987 ) , and Blundell and Smith ( 1989 ) discussed two - step procedures , minimum - distance estimators , generalized least squares ( GLS ) estimators , and other variations on the tradi - tional ML framework . Semiparametric estimators based on weaker distributional assumptions were discussed by , among others , Newey ( 1985 ) and Lee ( 1996 ) . The basic idea behind these strategies can be described as follows . Take the censored - regression model from ( 11 ) and add a latent (cid:142) rst stage with instrumental variables , Z i . So the complete model is Y i D 1 6Y i > 0 7Y ü i Y ü i D Y ü 0 i C 4Y 1 i ƒ Y ü 0 i 5D i D Y ü 0 i C D i (cid:129) D Œ C D i (cid:129) C ˜ i D i D 1 6ƒ 0 C ƒ 1 Z i > ‡ i 70 ( 15 ) The principal identifying assumption here is 4Y 0 i 1 ‡ i 5 q Z i 0 ( 16 ) Parametric schemes use two - step estimators or ML to esti - mate (cid:129) . Semiparametric estimators typically work by substi - tuting an estimated conditional expectation , ¹ E6D i — Z i 7 , for D i and then using a nonparametric or semiparametric procedure to estimate the pseueo reduced - form [ e . g . , Manski’s ( 1975 ) maximum score estimator for binary outcomes ] . The problems I see with this approach are the same as listed for censored regression models with exogenous regressors . First , latent index coef(cid:142) cients are not causal effects . If the out - come is binary , semiparametric methods estimate scaled index coef(cid:142) cients and not average causal effects . Similarly , censored regression parameters alone are not enough to determine the causal effect of D i on the observed Y i . [ I should note that this criticism does not apply to parametric estimators , where dis - tributional assumptions can be used to recover causal effects , or to a recently developed semiparametric method by Blundell and Powell ( 1999 ) for continuous endogenous variables . ] Sec - ond , this approach turns heavily on the latent - index setup . We can add to these points the fact that even weak distributional assumptions like conditional symmetry fail for the reduced - form error term , 4D i ƒ ¹ E6D i — Z i 75 ƒ ˜ i , since D i is binary ( a point made by Lee 1996 ) . A (cid:142) nal observation is that , given assumption ( 16 ) , this whole setup is unnecessary for causal inference . The effect of treatment on the observed Y i is identi(cid:142) ed for those women whose childbearing behavior is affected by the instrument . The twins instrument , for example , identi(cid:142) es the effect of D i on mothers who would not have had a third child without a mul - tiple second birth ( see result 4 in the earlier lemma ) . It may be of interest to extrapolate from this group’s experiences to those of other women , but the extrapolation problem is distinct from the problem of identifying the causal effect of childbear - ing in the “twins experiment . ” 4 . NEW ECONOMETRIC METHODS Conditional moments and other probability statements involving D i alone are necessarily linear , but causal relation - ships involving covariates are likely to be nonlinear unless the covariates are discrete and the model is saturated . LDV mod - els like probit and tobit are often used because of a concern that , unless the model is saturated , LDV’s lead to nonlinear CEF’s . The 2PM is sometimes also motivated this way ( e . g . , see Duan et al . 1984 ) . The headaches induced by nonlinearity notwithstanding , there are simple schemes for estimating causal effects in LDV models with endogenous regressors and covariates . In this section , I discuss three strategies for estimating effects on means and two for estimating effects on distributions . All but the (cid:142) rst are based on new models and methods . None are tied to an underlying structural model . The simplest option for estimating effects on means is undoubtedly to “punt” by using a linear , constant - effects model to describe the relationship of interest : E6Y 0 i — X i 7 D X 0 i ‚ ( 17a ) and Y 1 i D Y 0 i C (cid:129)0 ( 17b ) The assumptions lead a linear causal model , Y i D X 0 i ‚ C (cid:129)D i C ˜ i 1 ( 18 ) easily estimated by 2SLS . Although the constant - effects assumption is clearly unreal - istic , in practice , more general estimation strategies often lead to similar average effects . A second issue that arises in this setting is that , because D i is binary , a nonlinear (cid:142) rst - stage such as probit or logit may seem appropriate for 2SLS estimation of ( 18 ) . But the resulting second - stage estimates are inconsis - tent , unless the model for the (cid:142) rst - stage CEF is actually cor - rect . On the other hand , conventional 2SLS estimates using a linear probability model are consistent whether or not the (cid:142) rst - stage CEF is linear . So it is generally safer to use a linear (cid:142) rst - stage . Alternatively , consistent estimates can be obtained by using a linear or nonlinear estimate of E6D i — X i 1 Z i 7 as an instrument . ( This is the same as the plug - in - (cid:142) tted - values method when the (cid:142) rst - stage is linear . ) See Kelejian ( 1971 ) or Heckman ( 1978 , pp . 946 – 947 ) for a discussion of this point and additional references . ( It is also worth noting that a probit (cid:142) rst - stage cannot even be estimated for the twins instrument because P6D i D 1 — X i 1 Z i D 1 7 D 1 for twins . ) 4 . 1 IV for an Exponential Conditional Mean A linear model like ( 18 ) is obviously unrealistic for binary outcomes and fails to incorporate natural restrictions on the CEF for nonnegative LDV’s . This motivated Mullahy ( 1997 ) to estimate causal effects on nonnegative LDV’s using a multi - plicative model similar to that used by Wooldridge ( 1999 ) for panel data . The Mullahy ( 1997 ) model can be written in my notation as follows . Let X i be a vector of observed covariates Angrist : Estimation of Limited Dependent Variables Models With Dummy Endogenous Regressors 9 as before , and let — i be an unobserved covariate correlated with D i and Y 0 i . The fact that this covariate is unobserved is the reason we need to instrument . Let Z i be a candidate instrument . Conditional on observed and unobserved covariates , both treatment status and the instrument are assumed to be independent of potential out - comes : Y 0 i q 4D i 1Z i 5 — X i 1— i ( 19a ) Moreover , conditional on observed covariates , the candidate instrument is independent of the unobserved covariate : Z i q — i — X i 1 ( 19b ) though — i and D i are not conditionally independent . The CEF for Y 0 i is constrained to be nonnegative using an exponential model and ( 19a ) : E6Y 0 i — D i 1 Z i 1 X i 1— i 7 D exp 4X 0 i ‚ C (cid:143) — i 5 D — ü i exp 4X 0 i ‚51 ( 19c ) where we also assume that the unobservable covariate has been de(cid:142) ned so that E6— ü i — X i 7 D 1 ( this is a normalization because we can de(cid:142) ne — D (cid:143) ƒ 1 6“ ƒ ln 4E6e “ — X757 , where “ is unrestricted . ) Finally , the conditional - on - X - and - — average treatment effect is assumed to be proportionally constant , again using an exponential model that ensures nonnegative (cid:142) tted values : E6Y 1 i — D i 1Z i 1X i 1— i 7 D e (cid:129) E6Y 0 i — D i 1Z i 1X i 1— i 7 D e (cid:129) E6Y 0 i — X i 1 — i 70 ( 19d ) Combining ( 19c ) and ( 19d ) , we can write Y i D exp 4X 0 i ‚ C (cid:129)D i C (cid:143) — i 5 C ˜ i , where E6˜ i — D i 1 Z i 1 X i 1 — i 7 ² 0 . These assumptions imply E8 exp 4 ƒ X 0 i ‚ ƒ (cid:129)D i 5Y i ƒ 1 — X i 1Z i 9 D 0 1 ( 20 ) so ( 20 ) can be used for estimation provided Z i has an impact on D i . The proportional average treatment effect in this model is e (cid:129) ƒ 1 , or approximately (cid:129) for small values of (cid:129) . Estimation based on ( 20 ) guarantees nonnegative (cid:142) tted values , without dropping zeros as a traditional log - linear regression model would . The price for this is a constant - proportional - effects setup and the need for nonlinear estima - tion . It is interesting to note , however , that with a binary instrument and no covariates ( 20 ) generates a simple closed - form solution for (cid:129) . In the appendix , I show that with - out covariates the proportional treatment effect in Mullahy’s model can be written e (cid:129) ƒ 1 D E6Y i — Z i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y i — Z i D 0 7 ƒ 8E64 1 ƒ D i 5Y i — Z i D 1 7 ƒ E64 1 ƒ D i 5Y i — Z i D 0 79 0 ( 21 ) In light of this simpli(cid:142) cation , it seems worth asking if the right side of ( 21 ) has an interpretation that is not tied to the constant - proportional - effects model . To develop this inter - pretation , let D 0 i and D 1 i denote potential treatment assign - ments indexed against the binary instrument . For example , an assignment mechanism such as ( 15 ) determines D 0 i as fol - lows : D 0 i D 1 6ƒ 0 > ‡ i 7 and D 1 i D 1 6ƒ 0 C ƒ 1 > ‡ i 7 . Using this notation , Imbens and Angrist ( 1994 ) showed that E6Y i — Z i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y i — Z i D 0 7 D E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — D 1 i > D 0 i 7 (cid:128) 8E6D i — Z i D 1 7 ƒ E6D i — Z i D 0 790 ( 22 ) The term E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — D 1 i > D 0 i 7 is the LATE parameter men - tioned in Lemma 1 . The same argument used to establish ( 22 ) can also be used to show a similar result for the average of Y 0 i [ i . e . , instead of the average of Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i ; see Abadie ( 2000a ) for details ] . In particular , E64 1 ƒ D i 5Y i — Z i D 1 7 ƒ E64 1 ƒ D i 5Y i — Z i D 0 7 D ƒ E6Y 0 i — D 1 i > D 0 i 7 (cid:128) 8E6D i — Z i D 1 7 ƒ E6D i — Z i D 0 790 ( 23 ) Substituting ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) for the numerator and denominator in ( 21 ) , we have e (cid:129) ƒ 1 D E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — D 1 i > D 0 i 7 = E6Y 0 i — D 1 i > D 0 i 70 ( 24 ) Thus , Mullahy’s procedure estimates a proportional LATE parameter in models with no covariates . The resulting esti - mates therefore have a causal interpretation under much weaker assumptions than ( 19a ) – ( 19d ) . Moreover , the exponen - tial model used for covariates in ( 19c ) seems natural for non - negative dependent variables and has a semiparametric (cid:143) avor similar to proportional hazard models for duration data . 4 . 2 Approximating Causal Models Suppose that the additive , constant - effects assump - tions ( 17a ) and ( 17b ) do not hold but we estimate ( 18 ) by 2SLS anyway . It seems reasonable to imagine that the result - ing 2SLS estimates can be interpreted as providing some sort of “best linear approximation” to an underlying nonlinear causal relationship , just as regression provides the best linear predictor ( BLP ) for any CEF . Perhaps surprisingly , however , 2SLS does not provide this sort of linear approximation in general . On the other hand , in a recent article Abadie ( 2000b ) introduced a Causal - IV estimator that does have this property . Causal - IV is based on the assumptions used by Imbens and Angrist ( 1994 ) to estimate average treatment effects . Under these assumptions , it can be shown that treatment is indepen - dent of potential outcomes conditional on being in the group whose treatment status is affected by the instrument ( i . e , those with D 1 i > D 0 i , the group of “compliers” mentioned earlier ) . This independence can be expressed as Y 0 i 1Y 1 i q D i — X i 1D 1 i > D 0 i 0 ( 25 ) A consequence of ( 25 ) is that , for compliers , comparisons by treatment status have a causal interpretation : E6Y i — X i 1D i D 1 1D 1 i > D 0 i 7 ƒ E6Y i — X i 1D i D 0 1 D 1 i > D 0 i 7 D E6Y 1 i ƒ Y 0 i — X i 1D 1 i > D 0 i 70 10 Journal of Business & Economic Statistics , January 2001 For this reason , Abadie ( 2000b ) called E6Y i — X i 1 D i 1D 1 i > D 0 i 7 the Complier Causal Response Function ( CCRF ) . Now , consider choosing parameters b and a to minimize E64E6Y i — X i 1D i 1 D 1 i > D 0 i 7 ƒ X 0 i b ƒ aD i 5 2 — D 1 i > D 0 7 , or equiv - alently E64Y i ƒ X 0 i b ƒ aD i 5 2 — D 1 i > D 0 7 . This choice of b and a provides the minimum mean squared error ( MMSE ) approx - imation to the CCRF . Since the set of compliers is not iden - ti(cid:142) ed , this minimization problem is not feasible as written . However , it can be shown that E6Š i 4E6Y i — X i 1 D i 1D 1 i > D 0 i 7 ƒ X 0 i b ƒ aD i 5 2 7 = P6D 1 i > D 0 i 7 D E64E6Y i — X i 1D i 1 D 1 i > D 0 i 7 ƒ X 0 i b ƒ aD i 5 2 — D 1 i > D 0 71 where Š i D 1 ƒ D i 4 1 ƒ Z i 5 = 4 1 ƒ E6Z i — X i 75 ƒ 4 1 ƒ D i 5 š Z i = E6Z i — X i 7 . Since Š i can be estimated , the MMSE linear approximation to the CCRF can also be estimated . The result is a weighted least squares estimation problem with weights given by the estimated Š i . It is also worth noting that , although the preceding discus - sion focuses on linear approximation of the CCRF , any func - tion can be used for the approximation . For binary outcomes , for example , we might use ê6X 0 i b C aD i 7 and choose param - eters to minimize E6Š i 4Y i ƒ ê6X 0 i b ƒ aD i 75 2 7 . Similarly , for nonnegative outcomes , it seems sensible to use an exponential model , exp 6X 0 i b C aD i 7 , and choose parameters to minimize E6Š i 4Y i ƒ exp 6X i 0 b ƒ aD i 75 2 7 . Abadie’s framework allows (cid:143) ex - ible approximation of the CCRF using any functional form the researcher (cid:142) nds appealing and convenient . The resulting estimates have a robust causal interpretation , regardless of the shape of the actual CEF for potential outcomes . 4 . 3 Distribution and Quantile Treatment Effects If Y i has a mass point at 0 , the conditional mean pro - vides an incomplete picture of the causal impact of D i on Y i . We might like to know , for example , how much of the aver - age effect is due to changes in participation and how much involves changes elsewhere in the distribution . This sometimes motivates separate analyses of participation and conditional - on - positive effects . In Section 2 . 3 , I argued that questions regarding the effect of treatment on the distribution of out - comes are better addressed by comparing distributions . Simply comparing distributions is (cid:142) ne for the analysis of experimental data , but what if covariates are involved ? As with the analy - sis of mean outcomes , the simplest strategy is 2SLS , in this case using linear probability models for distribution ordinates : 1 6Y i µ c7 D X i 0 ‚ c C (cid:129) c D i C ˜ ci . Of course , the linear model is not literally correct for conditional distribution except in spe - cial cases ( e . g . , a saturated regression parameterization ) . Here too , the Abadie ( 2000b ) weighting scheme can be used to generate estimates that provide an MMSE error approxima - tion to the underlying distribution function ( see Imbens and Rubin 1997 for a related approach to this problem ) . The esti - mator in this case chooses b c and a c to minimize the sample analog of the following population minimand : E6Š i 4 1 6Y i µ c7 ƒ X 0 i b c ƒ a c D i 5 2 70 ( 26 ) The resulting estimates provide the BLP for P6Y i µ c — X i 1D i 1D 1 i > D 0 i 7 . The latter quantity has a causal interpre - tation because P6Y i µ c — X i 1D i D 1 1D 1 i > D 0 i 7 ƒ P6Y i µ c — X i 1 D i D 0 1 D 1 i > D 0 i 7 D P6Y 1 i µ c — X i 1D 1 i > D 0 i 7 ƒ P6Y 0 i µ c — X i 1D 1 i > D 0 i 70 Since the outcome is binary , nonlinear models such as probit or logit might also be used to approximate P6Y i µ c — X i 1D i 1D 1 i > D 0 i 7 . Likewise , it is equally straightforward to use Abadie’s weighting scheme to approximate the probability that the outcome falls into an interval instead of the cumula - tive distribution function . An alternative to estimation based on ( 26 ) postulates a linear model for quantiles instead of distribution ordinates . Conven - tional quantile regression ( QR ) models for exogenous regres - sors begin with a linear speci(cid:142) cation : Q ˆ 6Y i — X i 1D i 7 D X 0 i Œ ˆ 0 C Œ ˆ 1 D i . The parameters 4Œ ˆ 0 1Œ ˆ 1 5 can be shown to minimize E6(cid:144) ˆ 4Y i ƒ X 0 i m 0 ƒ m 1 D i 057 , where (cid:144) ˆ 4u i 5 D ˆu C i C 4 1 ƒ ˆ5u ƒ i is called the “check function” ( see Koenker and Basset 1978 ) . This minimization is computationally straightforward since it can be written as a linear programming problem . The analysis of quantiles has two advantages . First , quantiles like the median , quartiles , and deciles provide benchmarks that can be used to summarize and compare conditional distributions for different outcomes . In contrast , the choice of c for the analysis of distribution ordinates is application - speci(cid:142)c . Second , since nonnegative LDV’s are often ( virtually ) continuously distributed away from any mass points , linear models are likely to be more accurate for condi - tional quantiles than for conditional probabilities . [ For quan - tiles close to the censoring point , Powell’s ( 1986b ) censored QR model may be more appropriate . ] Abadie , Angrist , and Imbens ( 1998 ) developed a QR estimator for models with a binary endogeneous regres - sor . Their quantile treatment effects ( QTE ) procedure begins with a linear model for conditional quantiles for compliers : Q ˆ 6Y i — X i 1D i 1 D 1 i > D 0 i 7 D X 0 i ‚ ˆ C (cid:129) ˆ D i . The coef(cid:142) cient (cid:129) ˆ has a causal interpretation because D i is independent of potential outcomes conditional on X i , and the event D 1 i > D 0 i . There - fore , (cid:129) ˆ D Q ˆ 6Y 1 i — X i 1 D 1 i > D 0 i 7 ƒ Q ˆ 6Y 0 i — X i 1 D 1 i > D 0 i 7 . In other words , (cid:129) ˆ is the difference in ˆ quantiles for compliers . QTE parameters are estimated by minimizing a sample analog of the following weighted check - function minimand : E6Š i (cid:144) ˆ 4Y i ƒ X 0 i b ƒ aD i 57 . As with the Causal - IV estimators , weighting by Š i transforms the conventional QR minimand into a problem for compliers only . For computational rea - sons , however , it is useful to rewrite this as E6 Q Š i (cid:144) ˆ 4Y i ƒ X 0 i b ƒ aD i 057 , where Q Š i D E6Š i — X i 1 D i 1Y i 7 . It is possible to show that E6Š i — X i 1D i 1 Y i 7 D P6D 1 i > D 0 i — X i 1D i 1Y i 7 > 0 . This modi(cid:142) ed estimation problem has a linear programming representation similar to conventional quantile regression , since the weights are positive . Thus , QTE estimates can be computed using existing QR software , though this approach requires (cid:142) rst - step Angrist : Estimation of Limited Dependent Variables Models With Dummy Endogenous Regressors 11 estimation of Q Š i . In the following example , I use the fact that Q Š i D E6Š i — X i 1 D i 1Y i 7 D 1 ƒ D i 4 1 ƒ E6Z i — Y i 1D i 1X i 75 4 1 ƒ E6Z i — X i 75 ƒ 4 1 ƒ D i 5E6Z i — Y i D i 1X i 7 E6Z i — X i 7 ( 27 ) and estimate E6Z i — Y i 1D i 1X i 7 and E6Z i — X i 7 with a probit (cid:142) rst step . Since Q Š i is theoretically supposed to be positive , negative estimates of Q Š i are set to 0 . 5 . APPLICATION : LABOR – SUPPLY CONSEQUENCES OF A THIRD CHILD The estimation uses a sample of roughly 250 , 000 married women aged 21 – 35 with at least two children drawn from the 1980 Census 5 % (cid:142) le . About 53 % of the women in this sample worked in 1979 . Overall ( i . e . , including zeros ) , women in the sample worked about 17 hours per week . This can be seen in the (cid:142) rst column of Table 1 , which reports descriptive statis - tics and repeats some of the OLS and 2SLS estimates from Angrist and Evans ( 1998 ) . Roughly 38 % of women in this sample had a third child , an event indicated by the variable Morekids . The OLS estimates in column ( 2 ) show that women with Morekids D 1 were about 17 percentage points less likely to have worked in 1979 and worked about 6 hours fewer per week than women with Morekids D 0 . The covariates in this regression are age , age at (cid:142) rst birth , a dummy for male (cid:142) rst - born , a dummy for male secondborn , and Black , Hispanic , and other race indicators . Table 1 also reports estimates of average effects computed using nonlinear models , still treating Morekids as exogenous . These average effects are approximations to effects of treat - ment on the treated , evaluated using derivatives to simplify computations . A detailed description of the average - effects calculations appears in the appendix . Probit estimates of the average impact on employment , shown in column ( 3 ) , are almost identical to the OLS estimates . Similarly , the tobit esti - mate of the average effect of D i on hours worked , shown in column ( 4 ) , is ƒ 6 0 01 , remarkably close to the OLS estimate of ƒ 6 0 02 . ( Note , however , that the tobit coef(cid:142)cient is ƒ 11 0 7 . ) Column ( 5 ) of Table 1 reports estimated average effects from a two - part model in which both parts of the model are linear .

The instrument is an indicator for multiple births . The mean of the endogenous regressor is . 381 . The probability of a multiple birth is . 008 . The model includes as covariates age , age at rst birth , boy rst , boy second , and race indicators . Standard deviations are shown in parentheses in column 1 . Standard errors are shown in parentheses in other columns . The 2PM estimate is virtually identical to the tobit and OLS estimates . Roughly 8 / 10 of 1 % of women in the extract had a twin second birth ( multiple births are identi(cid:142) ed in the 1980 Cen - sus using age and quarter of birth ) . Reduced - form estimates of the effect of a twin birth are reported in columns ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) . The reduced forms show that women who had a multiple birth were 63 percentage points more likely to have had a third child than women who had a singleton second birth . Mothers of twins were also 5 . 5 percentage points less likely to be work - ing ( standard error D 0 01 ) and worked 2 . 2 fewer hours per week ( standard error D 0 37 ) . The 2SLS estimates derived from these reduced forms , reported in column 8 , show an impact of about ƒ 0 09 ( standard error D 0 02 ) on employment rates and ƒ 3 0 6 ( standard error D 0 6 ) on weekly hours . These estimates are just over half as large as the OLS estimates , suggesting that the latter exaggerate the causal effects of childbearing . Of course , the twins instrument is not perfect , and the 2SLS estimates may also be biased . For example , twinning probabil - ities are slightly higher for certain demographic groups . But Angrist and Evans ( 1998 ) found that 2SLS estimates using twins instruments are largely insensitive to the inclusion of controls for mothers’ personal characteristics . Two variations on linear models generate estimates iden - tical or almost identical to the conventional 2SLS estimates . This can be seen in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of Table 2 , which report 2SLS estimates of a 2PM for hours worked and Abadie ( 2000b ) Causal - IV estimates of linear models for employment and hours . The Causal - IV estimates use probit to estimate E [ Z | X ] and plug this into the formula for Š i . The second step in Causal - IV estimation is a weighted least squares problem , with some negative weights . Since use of negative weights is nonstandard for statistical packages ( e . g . , Stata does not cur - rently allow this ) , I used a MATLAB program available from Alberto Abadie to compute the estimates . The 2PM estimates in Table 3 were constructed from 2SLS estimates of a linear probability model for participation and 2SLS estimates of a linear model for hours worked conditional on working . In prin - ciple , the 2PM estimates do not have a causal interpretation because the instruments are not valid conditional on working . In practice , however , 2SLS estimates of the 2PM differ little from conventional 2SLS estimates . The estimates of nonlinear = nonstructural models for mean effects are mostly similar to each other and to conventional 12 Journal of Business & Economic Statistics , January 2001 Table 2 .

Standard errors are shown in parentheses . 2SLS estimates . Results from nonlinear models are again reported as marginal effects that approximate average effects on the treated : For example , a causal probit model for employ - ment status generates an average effect of ƒ 0 088 , identical ( up to the reported accuracy ) to the 2SLS estimate . Causal - IV esti - mation of an exponential model for hours worked , the result of a procedure that minimizes E6 Q Š i 4Y i ƒ exp 6X 0 i b ƒ aD i 75 2 7 , generates an estimate of ƒ 3 0 21 . This too differs little from the conventional 2SLS estimate of ƒ 3 0 55 . Similarly , the Mullahy estimate of ƒ 3 0 82 in column ( 4 ) is less than 8 % larger than conventional 2SLS in absolute value . It is noteworthy , how - ever , that the Mullahy model generates results that change markedly ( falling by about 20 % ) when the covariates are dropped . Since the covariates are not highly correlated with the twins instrument , this lack of robustness to the inclusion of covariates seems undesirable . On the other hand , with - Table 3 .

The sample and covariates are the same as in Panel A of Table 2 . Causal - IV estimates are based on a procedure discussed by Abadie ( 1999 ) . Quantile treatments are based on a procedure discussed by Abadie et al . ( 1998 ) . Standard errors are shown in parentheses . The standard errors in columns ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) are bootstrapped . out covariates , the Mullahy estimates are close to those from Causal - IV with an exponential model . The bivariate probit estimate of the effect of childbear - ing on employment status , reported in column 7 , is ƒ 0 12 , roughly a third larger in absolute value than the conventional 2SLS estimate . Interestingly , in another application , Abadie ( 2000b ) also found that bivariate probit estimates are larger than Causal - IV . The gap between bivariate probit and Causal - IV estimates of effects on labor supply appears to be a conse - quence of the probit model for exogenous covariates . Without covariates , bivariate probit generates estimates that are very close to the results from the other estimators . It should be noted , however , that bivariate probit is not really appropriate for twins instruments because the probability Morekids D 1 is equal to 1 for twins . The probit ML estimator does not exist in this case . Therefore , to compute all of the estimates using a Angrist : Estimation of Limited Dependent Variables Models With Dummy Endogenous Regressors 13 probit (cid:142) rst - stage ( bivariate probit , endogenous tobit , and Mills ratio ) , I randomly recoded 1 % of D i observations to 0 . In principle , measurement error in a binary endogenous regressor biases 2SLS estimates ( see Kane , Rouse , and Staiger 1999 ) . In this case , however , column ( 10 ) shows that 2SLS estimates with the randomly recoded data differ little from 2SLS esti - mates using the original data . Column ( 8 ) of Table 2 reports estimates of a structural tobit model with endogeneous regressors . These estimates were computed using a two - step estimator that approximates the MLE , again with recoded data . The two - step procedure adds a Mills - ratio type endogeneity correction to a censored regression and then applies tobit to the censored regres - sion model with the correction term . [ The correction term is (cid:144)‘ ˜ 6D i 4 ƒ (cid:157) i = ê i 5 C 4 1 ƒ D i 5(cid:157) i = 4 1 ƒ ê i 57 , where (cid:144) is the corre - lation between the latent error determining treatment assign - ment and the outcome residual ; ‘ ˜ is the standard deviation of the outcome residual and (cid:157) i and ê i are Normal density and distribution functions evaluated at the probit (cid:142) rst - stage (cid:142) tted values ; see Heckman and Robb ( 1985 ) . ] As with the bivariate probit estimate , the endogenous tobit estimate is somewhat larger in magnitude than conventional 2SLS . This may be because of the Mills - ratio procedure for controlling for the endogeneity of D i , more than the tobit correction for nonnegative outcomes . To see this , note that the Mills - ratio estimate ignoring censoring , reported in col - umn ( 9 ) , is considerably larger than the corresponding conven - tional 2SLS estimates . Interestingly , both the probit and tobit structural estimators generate results that are more sensitive to the inclusion of covariates than any of the other estimators except Mullahy’s . In fact , Panel B of the table shows that , without covariates , all estimation techniques give very simi - lar results . This is not surprising since , without covariates , the parametric assumptions used in these models are weaker . The last set of results shows that childbearing is associ - ated with marked changes in the distribution of hours worked , beyond the changes in participation already seen . This is apparent in the (cid:142) rst columns of Table 3 , which report the distribution of hours worked by interval , along with linear probability estimates of the relationship between childbearing and the probability of falling into each interval ( these mod - els include the same covariates used for Table 2 ) . The largest entry in column ( 1 ) is for the probability of working zero hours . There is also a large negative effect on the probability of working 31 – 40 hours per week , which shows that women who have a third child are much less likely to work full - time . Once again , probit average effects , reported in column 2 , are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding OLS estimates . Estimates from an ordered probit model , reported in column ( 3 ) , differ from OLS somewhat more but still gen - erate a very similar pattern . Like the 2SLS estimates for average outcomes , 2SLS esti - mates of linear probability models for the probability of falling into each interval show that models that treat childbearing as exogenous exaggerate the negative impact on labor supply . 2SLS estimates for the probability of working zero hours are identical ( by construction ) to those for employment in Table 1 . The 2SLS estimates of the impact of childbearing on fulltime work are also considerably less than the corresponding OLS estimates . Nonstructural Causal - IV models treating Morekids as endogenous generate estimates very close to 2SLS estimates for effects on the probabilities of hours falling into each inter - val . Columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) show that the results are also remark - ably insensitive to whether a linear or probit model is used to approximate the distribution function . The estimates again indicate that childbearing changes the distribution of hours by raising the probability of nonparticipation and by reducing the probability of fulltime work . Finally , the QTE estimator provides useful summary statis - tics for causal effects of childbearing on changes in the distri - bution of hours worked . These estimates were computed as the solution to a weighted quantile regression problem using ( 27 ) to construct weights , and the reported standard errors are from a bootstrap . Quantile regression estimates treating childbear - ing as exogenous show an estimated 9 - hour decline in median hours worked , but the QTE estimator suggests that the causal effect of childbearing on median hours worked is only about (cid:142) ve hours . Estimates at higher quantiles are similarly reduced when childbearing is treated as endogenous . 6 . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Structural parameters may be of theoretical interest but must ultimately be converted into causal effects if they are to be of use for policy evaluation or determining whether a trend association is causal . The problem of estimating causal effects for LDV’s does not differ fundamentally from the analogous problem for continuously distributed outcomes . The key dif - ferences seem to me to be the increased likelihood of inter - est in distributional outcomes and the inherent nonlinearity of CEF’s for LDV’s in models with covariates . Without covari - ates , conventional 2SLS estimates capture both distributional effects and effects on means . Simple IV strategies devel - oped by Mullahy ( 1997 ) and Abadie ( 2000b ) can be used to estimate average effects in nonlinear models with covariates , while IV strategies for probability models and quantile regres - sion can be used to estimate effects on distributions . These approaches are illustrated here using twin births to estimate the labor - supply consequences of childbearing . Alternative nonstructural approaches to the estimation of causal effects using twins instruments generate similar aver - age effects , whether or not the model is nonlinear . Structural estimates tend to be somewhat larger than nonstructural esti - mates when exogenous covariates are included , even though the covariates are not strongly related to the twins instru - ment . Since the structural models impose additional distribu - tional and functional form assumptions , I see no reason to prefer them . Finally , the various IV estimates of the effect of childbear - ing on the distribution of hours worked show that the impact of childbearing is characterized by substantially increased non - participation and by an almost equally large shift away from fulltime work . Estimates that treat childbearing as exogenous exaggerate the causal effect of childbearing on changes in dis - tribution , as well as on average hours worked . These (cid:142) ndings appear in results from both probability models and quantile models with endogenous regressors . Both types of models provide an interesting look at the impact of childbearing on 14 Journal of Business & Economic Statistics , January 2001 the distribution of hours worked , without the conceptual prob - lems inherent in conditional - on - positive comparisons .

Subtract 1 and rearrange to get Equation ( 21 ) . A . 3 Average Treatment Effects and Standard Errors for Nonlinear Models Average treatment effects were calculated with the aid of derivative approximations so that all reported effects have the form “coef(cid:142) cient times scaling factor . ” Probit . Note that ê6X 0 i ‚ C (cid:129)7 ƒ ê6X 0 i ‚7 (cid:157)6X 0 i ‚ C (cid:129)D i 7 š (cid:129)1 so the average effect on the treated can be approximated as 84 1 = N 1 5 P i D i (cid:157)6X 0 i ‚ C (cid:129)D i 79 š (cid:129)1 where N 1 D P i D i . This turns out to be accurate to three decimal places for the esti - mates in Table 1 . Standard errors were calculated treating the scaling factor as nonrandom . This follows the convention for reporting marginal effects in programs like Stata ; in practice , any correction for estimation of the scaling factor is likely to be minor . A similar approach was used for ordered probit . Tobit . Tobit average treatment effects were approximated using a derivative formula that can be found , for exam - ple , in the work of Greene ( 1999 ) : E6Y i — X i 1D i D 1 7 ƒ E6Y i — X i 1 D i D 0 7 ¡E6Y i — X i 1D i 7 = ¡D D ê6X 0 i ‚ C (cid:129)D i 7 š (cid:129)0 Average effects on the treated can therefore be approximated using 84 1 = N 1 5 P i D i ê6X 0 i ‚ C (cid:129)D i 79 š (cid:129)0 Standard errors were again calculated treating the scaling factor as nonrandom . 2PM . Let the part - 1 coef(cid:142) cient be (cid:129) 1 and the part - 2 coef(cid:142) - cient be (cid:129) 2 . Since the model multiplies parts and both parts are linear , the average effect is approximated using derivatives as (cid:129) 1 E6Y i — D i D 1 1Y i > 0 7 C (cid:129) 2 P6D i D 1 — Y > 0 70 Standard errors were calculated treating the scaling factors E6Y — D i D 1 1Y i > 0 7 and P6D i D 1 — Y > 0 7 as nonrandom , and using the fact that the estimates of (cid:129) 1 and (cid:129) 2 are uncorrelated . Mullahy . Note that E6Y i — X i 1D i 1— ü i 7 D — ü i exp 6X 0 i ‚ C D i (cid:129)7 , where this CEF has a causal interpretation . Again , using derivatives , we have — ü i exp 6X 0 i ‚ C (cid:129)7 ƒ — ü i exp 6X 0 i ‚7 — ü i exp 6X 0 i ‚ C (cid:129)D i 7 š (cid:129) . The model is such that E6— ü i — X i 7 equals 1 , but E6— ü i — X i 1D i 7 is unrestricted . I ignore this prob - lem and approximate the average effect on the treated as 84 1 = N 1 5 P i D i exp 6X 0 i ‚ C (cid:129)D i 79 š (cid:129) . Standard errors were cal - culated treating the scaling factor as nonrandom . Bivariate Probit . This is the same as probit , using param - eters from the latent index equation for outcomes . Endogenous Tobit . This is the same as tobit but using coef(cid:142) cients and predicted probability positive from the model with the compound Mills - ratio term included . Mills Ratio . Standard errors were calculated treating the compound Mills - ratio term as known . Angrist : Estimation of Limited Dependent Variables Models With Dummy Endogenous Regressors 15 Causal - IV ( nonlinear ) . Average effects were calculated as described previously for the probit and Mullahy ( exponential ) functional form . The (cid:142) rst - stage estimates of E6Z i — X i 7 needed to construct Š i were estimated using probit . Standard errors for (cid:129) were calculated using the same bootstrap procedure described for QTE . Abadie ( 2000b ) also gave analytic formu - las that take account of the (cid:142) rst - step estimation of E6Z i — X i 7 . An assumption implicit in this scheme for reporting Causal - IV results is that it makes sense to convert conditional - on - X effects for compliers into overall average effects on the treated . A . 4 Computation of Quantile Treatment Effects and Standard Errors QTE’s were computed by plugging (cid:142) rst - step estimates of Q Š i D E6Š i — X i 1D i 1Y i 7 into a weighted quantile regression calculation performed by Stata . Nonnegative estimates of E6Š i — X i 1 D i 1Y i 7 were constructed by separately estimating E6Z i — X i 7 and E6Z i — Y i 1D i 1X i 7 using probit and then trimming . In principle , standard errors should take account of this (cid:142) rst - step estimation . An additional complication is that the analytic standard errors for QTE involve a conditional error density . In this case , I sidestepped messy analytic calculations by using a bootstrap procedure that repeats both the (cid:142) rst - stage estima - tion of Q Š i and the second - step estimation of the parameters of interest in 100 replicate samples of 2 , 500 observations each . The 100 replicate samples were sampled without replacement using the Stata command bsample . The reported standard errors were calculated as 4N = N ü 5 1 = 2 bse N , where bse N is the standard deviation of the 100 replicate estimates , N D 2 1 500 , and N ü is the full sample size .

Comment : Binary Regressors in Nonlinear Panel - Data Models With Fixed Effects Jinyong H ahn Department of Economics , Brown University , Providence , RI 02912 ( jinyong hahn @ brown . edu ) Angrist notes in his abstract that “much of the dif(cid:142) culty with limited dependent variables comes from a focus on struc - tural parameters , such as index coef(cid:142) cients , instead of causal effects . Once the object of estimation is taken to be the causal effect of treatment , several simple strategies are available” ( p . 2 ) . I examine the consequence of such a perspective for inference in nonlinear panel - data models with (cid:142) xed effects . I argue that ( a ) the “dif(cid:142) culty” indeed disappears sometimes and ( b ) structure of treatment assignment plays a crucial role for his strategy to be successful . It is instructive to begin with a dif(cid:142) cult nonlinear panel - data model with (cid:142) xed effects . Consider a panel probit model with (cid:142) xed effects : Pr 6y it D 1 — c i 1 x i 1 1x i 2 7 D ê4c i C ˆ x it 51 i D 1 1 : : : 1n3 t D 1 1 2 0 ( 1 ) It is assumed that y i 1 and y i 2 are independent of each other given 4c i 1x i 1 1x i 2 5 . Here , c i denotes the unobserved (cid:142) xed effects , and x it denotes a binary treatment variable . We will assume that 4x i 1 1 x i 2 5 D 4 0 1 1 5 for all i . The index coef(cid:142) cient of interest is ˆ . Therefore , traditional econometric analysis would focus on whether ˆ is identi(cid:142) ed and / or p n - consistently estimable . Estimation of the index coef(cid:142) cient ˆ is dif(cid:142) cult for a num - ber of reasons : 1 . So far , no consistent estimator for ˆ has been developed for probit with a nonparametric speci(cid:142) cation of the conditional distribution of c i given 4x i 1 1x i 2 5 . 2 . It is not even clear whether ˆ is identi(cid:142) ed or not . Manski’s ( 1987 ) identi(cid:142) cation result requires in(cid:142) nite support for x it , which cannot be satis(cid:142) ed due to the binary nature of x it . 3 . It is not clear whether the semiparametric information bound for ˆ is positive or not . It is quite possible that the information is actually 0 . For example , Chamberlain ( 1992 ) showed that the information for ˆ is 0 for models with time dummies . 4 . Chamberlain’s ( 1984 ) conditional maximum likelihood estimator is applicable only to logit models . Now , to assess whether changing the object of estimation simpli(cid:142) es statistical analysis , consider the average treatment effects , which in this particular case can be easily shown to be equal to ‚ D E6y i 2 ƒ y i 1 70 ( 2 ) It is not dif(cid:142) cult to see that a simple estimator O ‚ D 1 = n P ni D 1 4y i 2 ƒ y i 1 5 is p n - consistent . As Angrist argues , a focus on average causal effects dramatically reduces the dif(cid:142) - culty of estimation . The secret is that 4x i 1 1 x i 2 5 D 4 0 1 1 5 for all i , which effectively ensures that c i is independent of 4x i 1 1x i 2 5 . Dif(cid:142) culty of the index estimation listed previously is because © 2001 American Statistical Association Journal of Business & Economic Statistics January 2001 , Vol . 19 , No . 1 Imbens : Comment 17 the independence between 4x i 1 1x i 2 5 and c i cannot be exploited within the (cid:142) xed - effects framework . Unfortunately , the addi - tional information that 4x i 1 1 x i 2 5 and c i are independent of each other does not reduce dif(cid:142) culty in estimating the index ˆ : It is not yet clear whether ˆ can be p n - consistently estimated even with the random - effects assumption when the random effects are nonparametrically speci(cid:142) ed . On the other hand , estimating ‚ becomes easier as a result of the constancy of the general - ized propensity score Pr 6x i 1 1x i 2 — c i 7 : Presence of unobserved c i in the model was rendered irrelevant due to the constancy of the generalized propensity score . [ See Imbens ( 1999 ) for a discussion on the generalized propensity score . ] It is interesting to note that , in the panel probit model ( 1 ) , estimation of ‚ is not necessarily simple unless the index structure is discarded altogether . It is useful to note that the new target parameter ‚ could be estimated consistently using index structure if consistent estimators of ˆ and ¬ are given . Here , ¬ denotes the distribution of c i . We may alternatively write ( 2 ) as Z 4ê4c C ˆ5 ƒ ê4c55d ¬ 4c51 ( 3 ) which can in principle be estimated by using consistent esti - mators of ˆ and ¬ . Estimation of ‚ using the alternative characterization ( 3 ) requires consistent estimation of an addi - tional parameter ¬ , a parameter that was not given too much attention in the past . The problem is that not many consis - tent estimators of ¬ are available . It is not yet clear whether the model satis(cid:142) es the primitive conditions for consistency of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator ( NPMLE ) as discussed by Heckman and Singer ( 1984 ) . The dif(cid:142) culty in estimating the target parameter using the expression ( 3 ) , which is based on the index structure , is in sharp contrast to the ease of the estimation strategy using the expression ( 2 ) , for which the index structure is irrelevant . The preceding discussion suggests that the success of Angrist’s perspective critically hinges on the structure of treat - ment assignment and careful reexpression of the new target parameter . If the joint distribution of c i and 4x i 1 1 x i 2 5 is com - pletely unknown , it is clear that changing the target parameter does not ease the dif(cid:142) culty of estimation . Angrist’s perspective therefore requires substantial effort in modeling such joint distribution . Whether such a modeling effort will be successful in dealing with nonlinear panel problems remains to be seen . ADDITIONAL REFERENCES Chamberlain , G .

I mbens Department of Economics , University of California at Los Angeles , Los Angeles , CA 90095 ( imbens @ econ . ucla . edu ) It is a pleasure to comment on this article by Joshua Angrist , whose applications of instrumental - variables methods ( Angrist 1989 ; Angrist and Krueger 1991 ) have been a source of inspiration for my own work in this area . As with Angrist’s previous work on instrumental variables , the current article raises some controversial issues and makes a number of impor - tant points . Here I offer some comments on three of them . First , I shall discuss the issues raised in Section 1 , “Causal Effects and Structural Parameters , ” concerning the goals of statistical inference . Angrist argues that many questions of interest are most easily formulated in terms of comparisons between realized and potential outcomes , the latter de(cid:142) ned as outcomes that would have been observed under alternative states of nature . I shall explore some of the implications of this view for empirical practice and econometric theory . Second , I shall offer some remarks on the role of economic theory in speci(cid:142) cation and identi(cid:142) cation of econometric models , again reinforcing Angrist’s point regarding the importance of for - mulating the key assumptions in terms of potential outcomes . Third , I shall discuss some of the issues related to the limited dependent nature of outcome variables for empirical practice , in particular in the presence of covariates . Partly motivated by the widespread perception of fundamental dif(cid:142) culties in applying instrumental - variables methods to data with limited dependent outcome variables , Angrist argues that standard lin - ear model techniques are generally applicable . I agree with Angrist’s position that most of these perceived problems are exaggerated but suggest that principled inference should nev - ertheless take account of the limited dependent nature of the outcome variables and use nonlinear models . 1 . CAUSAL ESTIMANDS In his textbook discussion of the difference between structural and reduced - form estimates , Goldberger ( 1997 ) wrote , following Marshak ( 1953 ) , that the ultimate goal of © 2001 American Statistical Association Journal of Business & Economic Statistics January 2001 , Vol . 19 , No . 1 18 Journal of Business & Economic Statistics , January 2001 econometrics is to provide predictions . More speci(cid:142) cally , in my view , the goal is to provide predictions of policy interven - tions . Using both economic theory and data , economists wish to inform policy discussions by providing predictions of states of the world under different policy choices . Based on com - parisons of such predictions , policy makers can then choose among the different policies using some social welfare mea - sure as objective function ( e . g . , Heckman and Smith 1997 ) . Angrist argues that such questions are most easily formulated in terms of potential outcomes . Here I want to elaborate on that view . Consider , as an example the problem faced by a policy maker contemplating a new tax in a market . To evaluate this policy , the policy maker wishes to take into account the effect of the tax on the quantity traded . Economic theory sug - gests that this effect depends on the slope of the supply and demand functions . The (cid:142) rst step is therefore the estimation of these slopes , and in the remainder of this discussion I shall focus on this component of the policy - evaluation problem . In principle the policy maker may be interested in the entire dis - tribution of the quantity traded under various taxes . Let us assume , however , that for purposes of evaluation of the poli - cies it is suf(cid:142) cient to know the average effect of the policy on the quantity traded . If there are only two values for the policy—for example , no tax or a tax—the difference between these two averages is the key quantity of interest . Following Rubin ( 1974 ) I will refer to this as the estimand . Note that the choice of estimand is distinct from the sta - tistical question of the speci(cid:142) cation of the model . Often the statistical model is speci(cid:142) ed in such a way that a single param - eter corresponds to the estimand . For example , in a structural interpretation of the linear regression model , the coef(cid:142) cients correspond to the effect of changing the covariates by a single unit . Such one - to - one correspondence , however , is the excep - tion rather than the rule . Wooldridge ( 1992 ) made this point in the context of Box – Cox regression models . Such models are often used when a linear representation for E6Y — X7 is inappro - priate . The Box – Cox regression model generalizes this linear form to E6Y 4‹5 — X7 D X 0 ‚ , where Y 4‹5 D ( 4Y ‹ ƒ 1 5 = ‹ ‹ 6D 0 1 ln Y ‹ D 0 0 Although consistent estimators for ‚ exist under these assump - tions , Wooldridge stressed that because ( a ) the interpretation of ‚ changes with the value of ‹ and ( b ) knowledge of ‚ and ‹ is not suf(cid:142) cient for recovering E6Y — X7 , there is no reason for economists to be interested in estimates of ‚ under these assumptions . In other words , ‚ cannot be the sole focus of the researcher because the question it answers changes with the value of nuisance parameters . Wooldridge then suggested an alternative speci(cid:142) cation that always allows the researcher to recover the conditional expectation E6Y — X7 . In empirical work this distinction between the estimand and the parameters of the statistical model is consistent with the now common practice of reporting estimates of average derivatives in binary response models rather than reporting estimates of the logit or probit coef(cid:142) cients . Unlike a linear regression model , there is no direct link from one of the coef - (cid:142) cients in the logit or probit model to average causal effects , and thus there is no intrinsic interest in such coef(cid:142) cients . This view is at odds , however , with a large part of the semi - parametric literature . An exception is the work by Stoker ( e . g . , Stoker 1986 ) , who focused on estimation of index coef(cid:142) cients in settings where these are proportional to average derivatives and thus directly linked to changes in predictions . Consider , for example , the work on semiparametric estimation of binary response models . In this literature , such models are esti - mated without making logistic or probit assumptions , instead only making conditional mean or median assumptions in a latent index interpretation ( e . g . , Manski 1985 ) . This literature , however , has begged the question of why economists should be interested in the coef(cid:142) cient estimates in these models in the absence of a direct link between these coef(cid:142) cients and the choice probabilities or their derivatives . Similarly , some of the models with (cid:142) xed effects in panel data with limited dependent variables have focused on estimation of parameters that in themselves do not allow for estimation of conditional expectations or their derivatives and thus do not allow for esti - mation of causal effects . See Arellano and Honoré ( in press ) for a survey of many of these methods . 2 . IDENTIFICATION After deciding on the estimand , the next step is to make substantive assumptions on the process that generated the data . This is where economic , as opposed to statistical , theory plays a key role . Theoretical considerations may suggest that certain variables have no direct causal effect on others because they do not enter into agents’ utility function , nor do they affect the constraints these agents face . For example , in some mar - kets it may be reasonable to postulate the existence of demand and supply function and assume that their intersection deter - mines observed prices and quantities . In that case it may be argued that certain variables—for example , weather conditions in agricultural markets—affect supply at (cid:142) xed prices but not demand because weather conditions do not affect utility of the buyers nor do they constrain their choices given prices . Similarly , theoretical considerations may suggest which vari - ables , determine agents’ fertility choices and which variables , are excluded from such choices , as in the structural models described in Section 1 . 2 of Angrist . For the purpose of considering such exclusion restrictions , as well as other assumptions , it is important to formulate them in a way that economic theory can be brought to bear on them . This makes the formulation in terms of counterfactuals or potential outcomes that Angrist advocates particularly appro - priate . The potential outcomes describe outcomes in differ - ent environments , and as such are the primitives of economic analyses , as well as choices under different sets of constraints , which are the result of agents solving constrained optimization problems . Since economic theory studies such optimization problems , it is therefore well equipped to assess assumptions formulated directly in terms of these potential outcomes . An example of the formulation of the critical assumptions in terms of such potential outcomes is Angrist , Imbens , and Rubin ( 1996 , AIR from here on ) . In contrast , latent index models , although under some conditions mathematically equivalent to Imbens : Comment 19 the potential outcome framework ( e . g . , Vytlacil 1999 ) , formu - late the critical assumptions in terms of associations between observed variables and unobserved residuals , which appears more dif(cid:142) cult to contemplate [ see Imbens ( 1997 ) for a dis - cussion of the confusion such formulations have caused in the statistics literature ] . It is rare that economic theory is speci(cid:142) c enough to deter - mine the exact value of the estimand . More typical is that the theory is consistent with a range of values for the esti - mand . Observations on agents’ choices and outcomes may be helpful in narrowing down this range . The econometrician’s task is to link the data to the estimand . Typically a num - ber of additional assumptions are made at this stage . Almost always it is assumed that there is only limited dependence , or no dependence at all , between choices made by different agents , and identi(cid:142) cation focuses on the link between the joint distribution of the observables , estimable in large samples , and the estimand . Two possibilities arise at this stage . Some - times the estimand can be expressed as a functional of the joint distribution of the observables , in which case the esti - mand is identi(cid:142) ed . A leading example is where the estimand is the average treatment effect and theory suggests that assign - ment to treatment is random , or at least random conditional on a set of observed covariates ( unconfounded assignment , selection on observables ) . Alternatively , the assumptions sug - gested by economic theory do not allow for the direct link between the distribution of observables and the estimand . In that case the researcher faces some choices . One option , advo - cated in a series of papers by Manski ( see , for a general dis - cussion , Manski 1995 ) , is to estimate the range of values of the estimand consistent with the data given the substantive assumptions . Another option , followed in the current article by Angrist , is the local average - treatment - effect approach devel - oped by Imbens and Angrist ( 1994 ) to consider what aspects of the estimand are identi(cid:142) ed given data and assumptions . In instrumental - variables settings , the population average treat - ment effect is often not identi(cid:142) ed , but the average effect for a speci(cid:142) c subpopulation may be . In that case one may choose to estimate the average treatment effect for this subpopula - tion and leave the extrapolation to the principal estimand to the researcher , possibly aided by theoretical considerations . As Heckman wrote , “It is a great virtue of the LATE parameter that it makes the investigator stick to the data at hand , and sep - arate out the aspects of an estimation that require out of sam - ple extrapolation or theorizing from aspects of an estimation that are based on observable data” ( Heckman 1999 , p . 832 ) . Let us consider the case studied by Angrist , with its focus on the effect of having more than two children on labor sup - ply . Angrist argues that the second birth being a multiple birth ( e . g . , twins ) is a valid instrument for this effect . In terms of the AIR formulation , this requires a multiple birth to be as good as randomly assigned , and the absence of a systematic direct effect on labor supply other than through its effect on the number of children . Such assumptions may be contro - versial . For example , fertility treatments may lead to a sys - tematic association between multiple births and choices made by couples , violating the (cid:142) rst assumption . Even if we accept these assumptions , however , they only imply that the aver - age causal effect of more kids on labor supply is identi(cid:142) ed for women who had a third child solely because their sec - ond birth was a multiple birth ( compliers in the AIR termi - nology ) . In my view it is unlikely that this is the population of primary interest . Nevertheless , it is the only subpopulation the data are informative about in the sense of point identi(cid:142) ca - tion under the substantive assumptions , and it would appear to offer some guidance regarding the population average causal effect to policy makers similar to the way in the medical world results from clinical trials in homogenous subpopulations are regarded as useful because they are viewed as indicative of population average causal effects . 3 . LIMITED DEPENDENT VARIABLES Typically economic theory offers some guidance concern - ing the determinants of certain outcomes without specifying the exact form or strength of their relationship . In that case statistical modeling is required to complete the speci(cid:142) cation . Consider the example Angrist studies with binary outcome , binary endogenous regressor , a binary instrument , and covari - ates . Angrist suggests as one possible approach estimating the average treatment effect through a linear probability model with instrumenting for an endogenous regressor . The bene(cid:142) ts of the linear probability approach stemming from the linear - ity and robustness against misspeci(cid:142) cation of the (cid:142) rst stage appear to me largely illusory . At this point the statistical mod - eling is only intended to provide (cid:143) exible approximations to the underlying conditional distributions . This is a fundamentally different role from that played by the substantive assumptions that are essential for identi(cid:142) cation . Appeals to consistency under speci(cid:142) c parameterizations therefore appear irrelevant— in a larger sample one may well wish to use a more (cid:143) exible speci(cid:142) cation because less smoothing is required . In addition to (cid:142) nding the alleged bene(cid:142) ts of the linear probability model unpersuasive , I (cid:142) nd its disadvantages troubling . Within small subpopulations characterized by extreme values of the covari - ates , the smoothing implicit in linear probability models is likely to lead to unattractive predictions compared to pre - dictions based on nonlinear models that respect the limited - dependent - variable nature of the outcomes . An alternative approach is followed in the study of the effect of (cid:143) u shots on hospitalization rates using randomized incen - tives for vaccination by Hirano , Imbens , Rubin , and Zhou ( 2000 , HIRZ from here on ) . Given their assumptions , exten - sions of those made by AIR to the case with exogenous covari - ates , there are three subpopulations—compliers ( units who change treatment status in response to a change in the value of the instrument ) , always - takers ( who always take the treat - ment , irrespective of the value of the instrument ) , and never - takers ( who never take the treatment , irrespective of the value of the instrument ) . HIRZ modeled the conditional distribution of these three “types” conditional on covariates as a trinomial distribution : Pr 4 Type i D c — X i D x5 D exp 4x 0 – c 5 1 C exp 4x 0 – c 5 C exp 4x 0 – a 51 Pr 4 Type i D a — X i D x5 D exp 4x 0 – a 5 1 C exp 4x 0 – c 5 C exp 4x 0 – a 51 20 Journal of Business & Economic Statistics , January 2001 and Pr 4 Type i D n — X i D x5 D 1 ƒ Pr 4 Type i D c — X i D x5 ƒ Pr 4 Type i D a — X i D x50 Now compare this setup to the selection models Angrist describes in Section 3 . In the selection models , the equation describing the endogenous regressor is D i D 1 8ƒ 0 C ƒ 1 Z i C ƒ 0 2 X i > ‡ i 9 . Suppose that the instrument is binary and that ƒ 1 is positive . Then the two models are very similar , with units with ƒ 0 C ƒ 1 C ƒ 0 2 X i > ‡ i in the selection model classi(cid:142) ed as always - takers in the potential outcome framework ( because , irrespec - tive of the value of the instrument , D i D 1 for such units ) , units with ƒ 0 C ƒ 0 2 X i < ‡ i classi(cid:142) ed as never - takers ( because , irre - spective of the value of the instrument , D i D 0 for such units ) , and the units with ƒ 0 C ƒ 0 2 X i < ‡ i < ƒ 0 C ƒ 1 C ƒ 0 2 X i classi(cid:142) ed as compliers . One advantage of the trinomial model is that it easily gen - eralizes to provide an arbitrarily good (cid:142) t to any conditional trinomial distribution by including higher - order terms and interactions in the covariates . If there are no substantive rea - sons to impose additional restrictions one should not impose them implicitly in the speci(cid:142) cation of the statistical model . In particular , in the selection model it is not suf(cid:142) cient to add higher - order terms to the covariate vector to provide an arbi - trarily good (cid:142) t to the trinomial distribution . Such an approxi - mation would have to involve heteroscedasticity and other dis - tributionalextensions that are not straightforward to implement in the selection model . Conditional on the individual’s type , HIRZ speci(cid:142) ed the outcome distributions given covariates as logistic regression models . Again the aim is to provide a (cid:143) exible approxima - tion to the conditional distribution in a manner that does not impose any implicit restrictions . Given that for a binomial distribution the logistic regression model can be thought of as providing a linear approximation to the log odds ratio , this choice is again an appealing one . An alternative is the probit model , which also provides a good approximation . Less attractive here is the linear probability model since it requires inequality restrictions on the parameters if the implicit esti - mates of the probabilities are to be bounded between 0 and 1 . In cases with other limited dependent variables , alternative nonlinear models may be appropriate . For example , if the out - comes are durations , subject to censoring , models speci(cid:142) ed in terms of hazard functions ( e . g . , Lancaster 1979 ) may be con - venient for dealing with such data .

Although the article by Angrist ranges across a number of issues , much of the discussion , and the article title , suggests that the problem of concern is that instru - mental variables ( IV ) cannot be used in one of three common models . Let the (cid:142) rst model be y D (cid:129) C ‚d C x„ C … , where y is an absolutely continuous variable but d is binary , and where x is independent of … but d is not . Then ‚ can be consistently estimated with IV ( Heckman and Robb 1985 ) . Let the second model be y ü D (cid:129) C ‚d ü C x„ C … , where y ü and d ü are contin - uous and where y D 1 4y ü > 0 5 and d D d ü are the observed variables . The parameters of this model can likewise be esti - mated by IV with some auxiliary assumptions ( Newey 1986 ; see Blundell and Smith 1993 for a review of alternative meth - ods ) . But let the third model be y ü D (cid:129) C ‚d C x„ C … , where © 2001 American Statistical Association Journal of Business & Economic Statistics January 2001 , Vol . 19 , No . 1 Moftt : Comment 21 again y D 1 4y ü > 0 5 but now d is binary . The parameters of this model cannot be estimated by standard IV . Many of the examples in the Angrist article involve the censored regres - sion model rather than the binary choice model , but this and the other main points in the article apply to both . The Angrist Solution . The Angrist solution to the problem posed by the third of these models , where IV is not applica - ble , is to declare ‚ an uninteresting parameter and not worthy of estimation [ or , in his words , to “punt” ( p . 8 ) ] . This is remi - niscent of the solution to the Vietnam War suggested by some 1960s commentators : The United States should have simply declared victory , quickly withdrawn , and hoped that no one noticed that they had in fact lost . If ‚ is uninteresting , what is interesting , according to Angrist ? His answer is that interest should center on least squares approximations with y as the dependent variable and d and x as regressors . If endogeneity of d is a problem , linear IV should be applied , with linear IV given a LATE interpre - tation . He provides an empirical illustration . I will comment on three questions raised by the Angrist article : ( 1 ) Is ‚ an interesting parameter ? ( 2 ) Is the Linear IV estimator using observed y and d , which Imbens and Angrist ( 1994 ) relabeled the LATE , an interesting quantity ? ( 3 ) Is the illustrative application given in the Angrist article interesting ? Is ‚ an Interesting Parameter ? As Angrist notes , many of the issues raised by his solution have nothing to do with the endogeneity of d . Whether ‚ is an interesting parame - ter is one of these , at least in part . Given Angrist’s prefer - ence for linear projections , his position necessarily implies that all nonlinear models , of which the latent index model ( LIM ) is just one example , are uninteresting ( Angrist is not com - pletely consistent in his position because he does propose a nonlinear model with an exponential conditional mean func - tion in one section of his article , that model is subject to the same objections that he subjects the LIM to—arbitrary non - linearities , etc . ) . Thus his position boils down to a preference , in the binary dependent - variable case , for the linear proba - bility model ( LPM ) over the LIM and other nonlinear mod - els . This issue has been discussed for many years , even in a simultaneous - equations context [ e . g . , Heckman and MaCurdy ( 1985 ) , which Angrist does not reference ] . The dif(cid:142) culty with Angrist’s polar position on this issue— that the LPM is the only model of interest—is that it is funda - mentally untenable . The LPM is attractive because it is easy to interpret , providing parameter estimates that do not require transformation to learn the effects of a regressor on the mean of the dependent variable . It has a role to play in empirical work in summarizing the data as regards the conditional mean function and for initial explorations of the data , and virtu - ally all practitioners use it for this purpose . But beyond this it has no defense . Either it is equivalent to the latent - variable model if the model is saturated or , if the model is not satu - rated , imposes functional form restrictions that may not hold and may (cid:142) t the data worse than the latent - variable model . Thus , if the model is y D 1 4(cid:129) C ‚d C … > 0 5 , where d is a single dummy variable regressor independent of … , the probit ( say ) estimates of (cid:129) and ‚ map one - to - one onto the least squares intercept and coef(cid:142) cient on d in the LPM , and hence there is no gain to estimating the model either way because the estimators are equivalent . The same point extends to the case of a multinomial d . If the model is y D 1 4(cid:129) C ‚d C x„ C … > 0 5 , where x and „ are vectors of exogenous covariates and coef(cid:142) cients , respectively , the LPM estimate of the effect of d on E4y5 conditional on x may be demonstrably worse than the probit estimator of the same effect , even for the object of estimating E4y — d1 x5 at points 8d1 x9 observed in the data ( Angrist falls back on the weak principle that least squares estimates provide best linear approximations , but the issue is that the true model might be nonlinear ) . Nothing in Angrist’s article provides evidence that the probitor any other latent index formulation provides an inferior estimate of 6E4y — d 1 1 x5 ƒ E4y — d 0 1x57 compared to the LPM , for the two estimators smooth the joint response function with respect to d and x in different ways . Although the latent - variable model has no necessary claim for superiority in the class of all nonlinear models , its pop - ularity rests on its ability to generate a wide variety of non - linearities with a relatively parsimonious speci(cid:142) cation , arising from the convolution of the latent index with the cdf of … . Expansion of the LPM to incorporate equivalent nonlinearities is cumbersome and inef(cid:142) cient . The possible inferiority of the LPM in capturing nonlinear - ities in nonsaturated models is also important for interpolation and extrapolation to points not in the observed data . Getting the nonlinearities right in the observed data is important in interpolation and extrapolation if the true model is nonlinear , as the binary choice model necessarily is ( since y is bounded by 0 and 1 ) . Although Angrist at one point does mention prediction—stating that the linearized models he proposes are a good “jumping - off point for any prediction exercise , ” a state - ment without support—he is , for the most part , not interested in prediction so much as summarizing the observed data . This is (cid:142) ne but , unfortunately , prediction outside the observed , his - torical data is the pervasive concern of the policy makers who are the ultimate consumers of applied economic research , for they must make predictions of new policies in new environ - ments on a daily basis as part of their jobs . The methods pro - posed in Angrist’s article are therefore not very useful for the formulation of new policy . It should be noted that some make the argument that theory and economic models must play a role in guiding the formu - lation of empirical relationships used for prediction outside the range of the observed data . That position is not taken here because it is not necessary to establish the potential superior - ity of the LIM over the LPM in nonsaturated models and for prediction ; Occam’s razor makes it unnecessary . It should also be noted that these issues have nothing to do with causal effects because d is assumed exogenous . Thus the opposition that Angrist poses between LIM’s and “causal effects” models is a false one , at least in general . If a “causal effect” is de(cid:142) ned as the true effect of a variable d on only the (cid:142) rst moment of a variable y ( a rather restricted de(cid:142) nition of causal effect ) , that causal effect can be derived from the latent - variable model just as well . The issue is instead merely nonlinearity of the function E4y — d1 x5 . Angrist also states that the LIM requires “constant coef - (cid:142) cient” and “distributional assumptions” for identi(cid:142) cation , 22 Journal of Business & Economic Statistics , January 2001 unlike the LPM . Angrist does not make suf(cid:142) cient quali(cid:142) ca - tions to these assertions , and they are indeed false for the LIM . A random coef(cid:142) cient ‚ in the LIM is permissible with - out distributional assumption ( Ichimura and Thompson 1998 ) and the coef(cid:142) cients in the standard constant - coef(cid:142)cient LIM are identi(cid:142) ed semiparametrically ( i . e . , under unknown distri - bution of … ) under the restriction that d and … are independent , an assumption generally made for causal interpretation of the LPM model as well ( Manski 1988 ; Horowitz 1993 ; Powell 1994 ) . In addition , as already noted , in a fully saturated model the LPM and the LIM are equivalent in any case . Is the LATE an Interesting Statistic ? The Angrist assertion that LATE is the only interesting statistic if d is endogenous , or perhaps the only statistic worth bothering about because it is the only one identi(cid:142) ed by the data , has the same partial validity as his preference for the LPM over the LIM . IV is one of the most popular techniques in applied econometrics and has a natural intuition , indeed , one that does not require the LATE interpretation per se . It is one of the most useful tools in the applied economist’s kit . The simple IV estimator discussed by Angrist makes minimal assumptions and gives minimal information back to the analyst as a result . But to say that it produces the only statistic of interest does not have defense , both because it is equivalent to an LIM that is fully saturated and may (cid:142) t the data worse than an LIM if not satu - rated and because it implies that there is no value to making additional assumptions to obtain additional information . The limiting nature of the LATE statistic is , again , in its inattention to nonlinearities , interpolation , and extrapolation . That nonlinearities can be important is as true in this case as it was in the exogenous case just discussed when there are additional x covariates and when the model is not satu - rated . As for interpolation and extrapolation , the LATE statis - tic 6 N y4z D z 1 5 ƒ N y4z D z 0 57 = 6 N d4z D z 1 5 ƒ N d4z D z 0 57 denotes the effect on a change in z from value z 0 to z 1 on E4y5 , scaled by the change in the E4d5 . It does not have implications for the effect on E4y5 of any other change in z or for a change in any other policy variable . Thus it is not particularly useful for policy changes other than a change of z 0 to z 1 in the same environment ( i . e . , conditioned on the same x ) . This stands in contrast to an LIM for E4d — x1z5 —or any parametric model for d , for that matter—that allows for the change from z 0 to z 1 to inform policy makers and others of the likely changes of other values of z and of other variables x . In fact , the LATE statistic , which is not a parameter in the usual sense of the word , can always be expressed as a nonlinear combi - nation of parameters of a latent - variable model but not vice versa ; hence the latter model is more general than the former . [ See Heckman and Vytlacil ( 1999 ) for a discussion of how to express the LATE in terms of an LIM ; see also Angrist and Imbens ( 1999 ) and Heckman ( 1997 , 1999 ) for a discussion of some of these issues . ] In addition , Angrist’s focus on the advantages of the LATE for model - free estimation of the effect of a change in z from z 0 to z 1 on y reveals a philosophical weakness in his posi - tion . This is because the effect of a change in z from z 0 to z 1 on y can be estimated from the reduced form ; the struc - tural form is not needed . It is not explained why the statistic 6E4y — z D z 1 5 ƒ E4y — z D z 0 57 is not the only quantity of inter - est . The answer that most economists would give is to say that structural coef(cid:142) cients are of interest because they can be used to extrapolate the effects of changes in d on y to other changes in z than from z 0 to z 1 in the same environment ; indeed , this is the basic rationale for structural estimation given in the famous essay by Marschak [ 1953 ; see also Christ ( 1994 ) and Heckman ( 2000 ) for discussions ; Marschak’s argument was more subtle than this , arguing that restrictions on struc - tural parameters are needed for out - of - sample prediction , but this translates into restrictions on the reduced form as well ] . However , by ruling out the possibility of learning about any of the effects of changes in z or d other than those induced by a change in z from z 0 to z 1 , Angrist removes the need to do structural estimation in the (cid:142) rst place . Angrist implicitly assumes that a structural coef(cid:142) cient of interest exists on the variable d in the y equation and that that coef(cid:142) cient has mean - ing independent of a particular change in z , but the rest of his discussion contravenes that interest . A reduced - form research program , which is where the Angrist position leads , is of considerable value . There is noth - ing wrong with a research program to collect a large body of information on the effects of a wide variety of changes in dif - ferent policy variables 4z5 from particular values ( z 0 ) to other particular values ( z 1 ) , each taking place in particular environ - ments ( x ) . But if the research program stops there , very little useful has been learned other than a collection of facts about the effects of particular policies in particular environments . Is the Application in the Angrist Article Interesting ? The Angrist article uses a recently popular exclusion restriction , or natural experiment , to identify the effect of fertility on labor supply and to illustrate his preferred methods—namely , the use of twins . The use of twins as an exclusion restriction stands in contrast to variations in a government policy or law , which are often used as exclusion restrictions both in recent work on natural experiments as well as a much older litera - ture that uses cross - sectional and overtime variation in state - or country - speci(cid:142)c taxes and transfer rules to identify model parameters . However , although it can be of interest to estimate reduced - form policy effects , 6E4y — z D z 1 5 ƒ E4y — z D z 0 57 , as just discussed , it is not so obvious that there is any interest in estimating the effects of having twins on the expected value of y . Creating twins is not a variable directly subject to policy manipulation . The dif(cid:142) culty in the use of twins arises for the same reason already discussed—namely , that the preference for model - free estimation of policy effects leads to a lack of interest in the function E4d — z1 x5 and hence to a lack of interest in what can be learned from a study of twins about the effects of some other , more relevant policy variable that might be manipulated . A model for the E4d — z1 x5 is needed to make that connection and hence to make a study of twins of any interest , yet that is intentionally eschewed in the approach proposed by Angrist . Once again , this leads to an uninteresting and quite limiting set of exercises . Conclusions . The set of methods laid out in the Angrist article , at least if a more relevant instrument were used , yields a set of model - free statistics that are suitable for exploratory work on a research question prior to the ( possibly nonlinear ) Mullahy : Comment 23 structural estimation and prediction that should be the ultimate object of applied economics research .

Comment John M ullahy Departments of Preventive Medicine and Economics , University of Wisconsin , Madison , WI 53705 , and National Bureau of Economic Research , Cambridge , MA ( jmullahy @ facstaff . wisc . edu ) Articles bearing titles containing phrases like “Simple Strategies for Empirical Practice” are often wolves masquerad - ing as sheep , the methodologies they devise being far from “simple” and far removed from what most humble practition - ers perceive in the realm of “empirical practice . ” Not so here . Joshua Angrist has written a tight , comprehensive article that is stimulating and important , yet also eminently useful . As typi(cid:142) es much of Angrist’s work , the main concern in this article is on how to elicit interesting characterizations of causal effects from microdata , with the particular twist here being a focus on outcomes measured as “limited dependent variables” ( LDV’s ) . The main take - away message I glean from this arti - cle is that applied analysts working on causal effect or struc - tural analyses in LDV contexts—traditionally vexing contexts insofar as consistent estimation and inference are concerned— have considerable grounds for optimism . Angrist lays out and interprets systematically a set of issues and methods that pro - vide practitioners with a variety of implementable strategies that might be brought to bear on such empirical problems . A corollary take - away message is that in some respects “this stuff is not really as hard as we’ve tended to make it , ” with Angrist demonstrating , for instance , the potential merits of simple linear instrumental variable ( IV ) methods for estimat - ing causal effects in a variety of LDV contexts . In no event can applied analysts escape the requirement of (cid:142) nding theo - retically sound instruments , but Angrist exposits compellingly a broad description of how such instruments might be used to elicit interesting causal inferences in LDV contexts . I have no real quibbles with any of the substance of Angrist’s arguments . Rather , I will devote my commentary mainly to amplifying and expanding several of the themes he develops throughout the article . 1 . FOCUS ON CAUSAL OR PARTIAL EFFECTS VERSUS FOCUS ON CONDITIONAL EXPECTATIONS FUNCTIONS It seems fair to suggest that much of applied microecono - metrics is concerned primarily with understanding the signs and magnitudes of quantities like ¡E6Y — X1 D7 = ¡4X1 D5 or ¡E6Y — X7 = ¡X0 Yet much of the actual dirty work in under - taking causal analysis in LDV contexts seems to result from decisions to undertake analyses in settings where E6Y — X1D7 or E6Y — X7 are restricted to be positive without a priori restric - tions on parameter values [ thus the tradition of using tobit - class conditional expectations functions ( CEF’s ) , two - step selection models , exponential CEF’s , etc . ] . As practitioners , however , we should pause to assess whether speci(cid:142) cations akin to E6Y — X1D7 D exp 4X‚ C (cid:129)D5 > © 2001 American Statistical Association Journal of Business & Economic Statistics January 2001 , Vol . 19 , No . 1 24 Journal of Business & Economic Statistics , January 2001 0 are ultimately buying anything important with respect to the (cid:142) rst - order questions being explored . It is only com - mon sense that analysts should spend relatively more energy working on understanding quantities of primary interest ( e . g . , ¡E6Y — X1D7 = ¡4X1 D5 ) and worrying relatively less about the formulation and implications of assumptions ( e . g . , E6Y — X1 D7 > 0 ) that may have little or no ultimate bearing on the particular questions being addressed . This is espe - cially so when the latter effort ( restricting via functional form choice E6Y — X1D7 > 0 ) will tend to complicate rather than facilitate the former effort ( understanding the partial or causal effects ) . This is not to suggest that quantities like E6Y — X7 and E6Y — X1 D7 may not themselves be interesting to estimate ( e . g . , modeling conditional mean health care expenditures for use in forecasting future expenditure levels ) , but whether E6Y — X1D7 is parametrically and parsimoniously better approximated by exp 4X‚ C (cid:129)D5 or by X‚ C (cid:129)D or by some other g4X‚ C (cid:129)D5 or h4X1D1 ƒ5 is—even in LDV settings—ultimately an empir - ical matter to be assessed by goodness of (cid:142) t ( e . g . , via condi - tional moment tests ) . I note this important angle somewhat sheepishly since in both articles of mine that Angrist cites ( Mullahy 1997 , 1998 ) there is considerable emphasis on the use of exponen - tial CEF speci(cid:142) cations as enforcers of positive conditional mean “requirements . ” In fact , the main motivation for the earlier article was to (cid:142) nd a general approach to obtaining consistent estimators of structural parameters in parametric settings less distribution - bound than tobit - class models when the key requirement or side constraint is E6Y — X1 D7 > 0 , with the resulting strategy a more or less brute - force method for accomplishing this in a nonlinear IV setting . Angrist’s arti - cle takes this idea quite a bit further and demonstrates how ( and with the addition of a further normalization ) the struc - tural parameter estimation approach I discussed can be devel - oped into a model to analyze causal effects when the latter are characterized as “proportional treatment effects . ” Whether a proportional , as opposed to an additive , treatment effect is interesting ( it may or may not be ) remains to be seen in any particular application . Wooldridge’s recent work on average causal effects ( ACE’s ; Wooldridge 1999 ) would seem pertinent in contexts in which the role of the X covariates is more “intrusive” than in the simple additive / linear treatment - effect setup . As a general matter , the extent to which infer - ences about causal effects—however formulated—hinge on the inclusion of particular covariates as conditioning regres - sors is an interesting and potentially important angle that Angrist’s article begins to explore and is one that likely to merit additional research . For the particular issues at hand , the very nature of proportional treatment effects brings into focus explicitly the role of the X ’s , so how their correlation with the treatment indicators 4D5 in(cid:143) uences inferences about the causal impacts of the latter would seem to be a (cid:142) rst - order consideration . 2 . TWO - PART MODELS I found Angrist’s analysis of the interpretation of causal effects in two - part models to be extremely illuminating . In a reduced - form setting , I argued ( Mullahy 1998 ) that , amid all the concerns about zeros , robustness , outliers , transforma - tion , retransformation , and such that have typically attended modeling efforts involving two - part models , it would be sur - prising in a well - structured empirical investigation if there were not stated or lurking concerns about partial effects ¡E6Y — X7 = ¡X and / or CEF’s E6Y — X7 themselves . It may be in some cases that such concerns are not articulated , and it may even be in less well - structured problems that they are not obvi - ous to analysts themselves . Yet , for instance , unless robustly estimated ‚ ’s from a log - linear part - 2 speci(cid:142) cation of a two - part model could inform a (cid:142) rst - order question about a par - tial effect or a CEF , of what practical use were they likely to be ? My rather modest and rather obvious argument was just that the concerns about the ¡E6Y — X7 = ¡X or the E6Y — X7 — if they are the reason the analysis is being conducted in the (cid:142) rst place—should enjoy (cid:142) rst - order prominence in the estima - tion exercise and that concerns about zeros , outliers , and such should be relegated in some sense to second - order status . In some cases , two - part models will serve nicely to address such (cid:142) rst - order concerns—at least in reduced - form settings—but in others they will not . Angrist appears to have some sympathy with such argu - ments , but more importantly he provides a valuable service to users of two - part models by unearthing one major limi - tation in the analysis of causal effects . The problem is not with part 1 ( i . e . , the logit , probit , or linear probability com - ponent ) because part 1 of the two - part model falls within the main lines of Angrist’s LDV analysis . Rather , the complication arises with part 2 of the two - part model in which the additional “ Y > 0” conditioning arises . In the standard ( reduced - form ) two - part model , quantities like E6Y — X1Y > 0 7 are prominent and identi(cid:142) ed readily . But in the counterfactual settings in which causal effects are manifested , wherein the realized Y arises from self - selection into or out of treatment , such selec - tion effects introduce an ambiguity [ Eq . ( 12 ) ] and thereby confound the ability to glean causal effects from part - 2 esti - mates ( unless , as Angrist notes , censored regression methods are used , but Angrist also offers some compelling arguments against blind reliance on censored regression approaches ) . As such , if estimation of and inference about causal effects are the primary analytical concerns in data settings with Y ¶ 0 and Pr 4Y D 0 5 > 0 1 analysts may be well advised to avoid two - part modeling strategies and pursue some of the more direct linear and nonlinear estimation approaches discussed by Angrist in which one - part estimation approaches—zeros and all ! —yield estimates of causal effects that will be directly interpretable . 3 . BEYOND CEF’S One noteworthy feature of the methods Angrist discusses— with the main results attributed to Abadie ( 1999 ) —are their applicability to estimation of causal effects for characteristics of the conditional distribution ”4Y — X1D5 beyond just CEF’s . Estimation of causal or treatment effects for conditional quan - tiles ( QTE’s ) and conditional distribution function ordinates ( “distiles” ) , Pr 4Y < c — X1D5 , is demonstrated to (cid:142) t properly within the weighting strategies advanced by Abadie . Since Todd : Comment 25 quantile and distile analyses may be more relevant in address - ing particular analytical questions or policy issues than CEF’s , the ability to extend the mechanisms of causal - effect esti - mation strategies in such directions should be welcomed by applied researchers . I might suggest that Angrist’s claim about an advantage of quantile causal analysis over distile causal analysis , being that the latter relies on application - speci(cid:142)c values of ordinates ( c ) , is perhaps oversold or underdeveloped . In many interesting and policy - relevant applications , focus on the application - speci(cid:142) c ordinates is fundamental : What factors cause employ - ers to offer more than one health insurance plan to employees ? What factors cause consumers of alcoholic beverages to drink more than two drinks per day ? What factors cause elderly individuals to utilize more than one prescription drug prod - uct ? What factors cause second earners to work more than 17 hours per week ? Each of these concerns an important real - world causal question for which the application - speci(cid:142)c ordinate—whether for institutional , legal , physiological , or other reasons—is a fundamental “pivot point” for the analysis . Analysis of such distile relationships—whether in causal or in reduced - form settings—is a potentially powerful method for informing decision makers , and it seems to me that its mer - its relative to quantile analyses would have to be judged on a case - by - case basis . 4 . CONCLUSIONS Practitioners of applied microeconometrics will (cid:142) nd that the time invested in a careful reading of Angrist’s article has sizable returns , not merely because of the analytical and con - ceptual insights it offers but ultimately also because it sug - gests a variety of important practical innovations that applied researchers can exploit empirically to more clearly understand the nature of causal relationships in their data . Applied micro researchers in areas like health , labor , development , public (cid:142) nance , and such work commonly with data wherein ( a ) out - come measures are limited—often most importantly because they are nonnegative with mass points at 0—and ( b ) the roles of conditioningcovariates ( X ’s ) are most convenientlysumma - rized via regression methods . Angrist’s article provides applied researchers so endowed with a set of powerful tools for elic - iting causal inferences from such data . Of course , the punch line is familiar and inevitable : All bets are off without theo - retically solid instruments . But with such instruments in hand , the strategies exposited by Angrist offer analysts a rich set of perspectives on estimation . ADDITIONAL REFERENCE Wooldridge , J . M . ( 1999 ) , “Estimating Average Partial Effects Under Con - ditional Moment Independence Assumptions , ” mimeo , Michigan State University , Dept . of Economics . Comment Petra T odd Department of Economics , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA 19104 ( petra @ athona . sas . upenn . edu ) This article considers ways of estimating the effect of binary , endogenous regressors in models with limited depen - dent variables . It questions the usefulness of conventional estimation strategies aimed at recovering structural model parameters and advocates the use of simple instrumental vari - ables ( IV ) estimators as an alternative , on the grounds that these estimators invoke weaker assumptions and often suf(cid:142) ce to answer questions of interest in empirical studies . In the author’s view , the main challenge facing empirical researchers is the problem of identi(cid:142) cation of “treatment effects” through IV . Here , I expand the discussion by considering two ques - tions : ( 1 ) What are the limitations of the causal model as a paradigm for policy analysis ? ( 2 ) When simple estimators are suitable for answering a question of interest , what are the trade - offs that need to be considered in using them ? 1 . WHEN IS THE “CAUSAL MODEL“A USEFUL PARADIGM FOR POLICY ANALYSIS ? The article gives the impression that most interesting ques - tions in economics can be answered within the context of the “causal model” [ variously attributed to Neyman ( 1923 ) , Fisher ( 1935 ) , Cox ( 1958 ) , Roy ( 1951 ) , and Rubin ( 1978 ) ] . The causal model is a very general framework that assumes that there are potential outcome states , associated with having received some treatment and having received no treatment ( or possibly a different treatment ) . For each individual , only one of the potential outcome states is observed , which leads to a missing - data problem in attempting to draw inferences about aspects of the treatment effect distribution . The language of potential outcomes is very general , so almost any economic problem could be formulated in these terms . However , this does not mean that estimators proposed in the literature for the causal model are useful for all or even most economic problems . A major limitation of the model is that it assumes that the state “with treatment” has been observed for at least a subset of people . In medical trials or biological experiments , this assumption is probably reason - able , but in economics we often are interested in evaluating effects of treatments that have not yet been implemented . For example , we might be interested in predicting the effect of raising the age receiving Social Security bene(cid:142) ts to a new age or the effect of introducing new term limits on welfare par - ticipation . An implicit assumption needed to apply any of the identi(cid:142) cation results described in this article is that both Y 1 © 2001 American Statistical Association Journal of Business & Economic Statistics January 2001 , Vol . 19 , No . 1 26 Journal of Business & Economic Statistics , January 2001 and Y 0 are observed , which would not be satis(cid:142) ed in many cases . Thus , the causal model and the estimators developed for it are inadequate when it comes to any economic question involving a state of the world that has not been observed . Despite these limitations , treatment effect estimates are sometimes used to predict consequences of new treatments or of existing treatments for new populations . When the policy change being considered is very close to changes observed in the data and is to be applied to similar individuals , then extrapolation may be reasonable . But if the policy change is ( a ) of a magnitude outside the range of experience , ( b ) along a new dimension , or ( c ) intended for a new population , then it is an open question as to how reliable the estimates would be . Treatment impact estimates are not intended to capture any - thing invariant to changing conditions . The assumptions that would be required to justify extrapolations or generalizations are often quite strong . To some extent , it is an illusion that these estimators allow for general kinds of inference under weak assumptions because the assumptions required to justify their application for particular purposes are often not made explicit . Angrist argues that the identi(cid:142) cation results for the local average treatment effect ( LATE ) estimator provide a “founda - tion for credible causal inference” ( p . 5 ) and a “minimum con - troversy jumping - off point for any prediction exercise” ( p . 5 ) . But as discussed previously , the causal model maintains such a high level of generality that it offers little guidance for many kinds of problems . It is important to recognize when and when not the LATE estimator is likely to be useful . This article claims that “in practice , estimates of LATE differ little from estimates based on the stronger assumptions invoked to iden - tify effects on the entire treated population” ( p . 5 ) . But such an extrapolation is not justi(cid:142) ed under the theory and is surely unlikely to hold in all circumstances . As shown in a num - ber of works by various authors , LATE provides the average effect of treatment for the group of “compliers , ” who are peo - ple induced by the instrument to receive treatment . This group does not , except under very special circumstances , correspond to the group of treated persons and may , in fact , represent only a small fraction of persons receiving treatment . So , not only does LATE not suf(cid:142) ce for answering problems of the sort described by ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , it also does not generally pro - vide the average effect of treatment on the treated—the most common parameter of interest in analyzing social programs . Another not - so - attractive feature of the estimator is that the population of “compliers” is usually not identi(cid:142) able , so we cannot say exactly whose treatment impact is being estimated . Applying the LATE parameter estimate to the full population of treated persons would generally require ruling out certain types of heterogeneity in individual responses to treatment , as discussed by Heckman ( 1997 ) . The explicit assumptions that could justify this type of extrapolation were shown by Heckman and Vytlacil ( 2000 , in press ) . 2 . ESTIMATORS SHOULD BE TAILORED TO THEIR APPLICATION A general theme throughout the article is that whenever possible researchers should restrain from imposing paramet - ric restrictions in estimation because the structure they impose may be wrong , resulting in biased estimates . This view is expressed , for example , in the discussion of the two - part model . The article advocates the use of a two - part approach instead of a conventional selection - model approach , maintain - ing that the two - part approach is less likely to lead to biased parameter estimates because it does not impose cross - equation restrictions as a conventional tobit estimator would . How do researchers decide whether or not to impose restric - tions across estimating equations that are structurally linked ? The most agnostic approach would be to estimate both equa - tions completely nonparametrically , but this approach is rarely practical . Nonparametric estimators are consistent under the most general conditions , but in conventional size samples the standard errors would be so large that the estimates would for practical purposes be useless . Researchers impose structure because they are willing to restrict the class of models under which their estimators are consistent in exchange for greater precision . These ef(cid:142) ciency considerations would also apply in the deciding whether or not to impose cross - equation restric - tions in estimating simultaneous - equations models . If we are right about the structure , there is an ef(cid:142) ciency gain from imposing the restrictions . If we are wrong , imposing them may lead to bias . When there are overidentifying restrictions , it is at least possible to develop tests of the model speci(cid:142) cation that can serve as a guide in choosing a structural model that is sup - ported by the data . This article presents a dichotomy between the two - part model and a fully parametric , traditional selec - tion speci(cid:142) cation , but there are many other modeling choices , ranging from fully nonparametric to semiparametric to fully parametric . In modest size samples , ef(cid:142) ciency is an impor - tant consideration and a parametric model may be the most appropriate one . For very large samples , fewer parametric approaches are feasible . Both the probability - of - working and the hours - worked equations could , for example , be estimated by a semiparametric method , such as semiparametric least squares ( Ichimura 1993 ) . Which estimation method is most appropriate ultimately depends on how much data is avail - able and how many parameters are to be estimated . It does not make sense to criticize the use of structured approaches in favor of more (cid:143) exible modeling approaches without regard to the context in which they are being applied . 3 . ON THE GAP BETWEEN THEORY AND EMPIRICAL PRACTICE Finally , another recurring emphasis in the article is on the value of shortcuts in empirical practice . In the author’s view , there is a gap between the econometric theory and what is feasible in practice , and shortcuts and approximations help to bridge this gap . To this end , the article extols , for example , the virtues of ordinary least squares ( OLS ) as a way of approx - imating any unknown conditional expectation function , with - out much concern as to whether a best linear approximation is a good approximation . If the model has discrete regressors and is fully saturated , it is well known that OLS is equivalent to a nonparametric estimator . But in other cases , a linear approxi - mation could be highly biased and the bias will not go away as the sample size gets large . There are a variety of alterna - tive asymptotically unbiased estimators . Along similar lines , Angrist : Reply 27 the article suggests that , in implementing a “selection - on - observables” estimator , it may be all right simply to ignore the weighting scheme . Such claims seem to me fairly outrageous because failure to take into account weighting could lead to very different estimates and would not provide a consistent estimator of the parameter of interest . Heckman , Ichimura , and Todd ( 1998 ) discussed alternative estimators that are not dif(cid:142) - cult to implement and take into account the weighting scheme . Finally , the appendix presents a variety of shortcuts for obtaining estimates and standard errors—some of which lead to inconsistent estimates . When shortcuts lead to very crude approximations or inconsistent estimates , I question their use - fulness . I do think it unreasonable to expect that estimates based on simple IV estimators be accompanied by correct standard errors that correctly take into account the in(cid:143) uence of estimated parameters of estimated regressors . I see little value in reporting incorrect standard - errors estimates on the grounds that it saves time in computation , especially when there are several works long available in the literature that develop sim - ple ways of solving these kinds of problems ( e . g . , see Newey 1984 ) . Although there is surely a gap between the estimators developed in the theoretic econometric literature and the esti - mators used in the empirical literature , the gap is not as great as this article supposes .

A ngrist I thank the discussants and the session organizer , outgoing JBES editor Jeff Wooldridge , who will be missed by associate editors and JBES authors alike . The comments in this session offer a variety of viewpoints , some sympathetic , others more critical . I am pleased to be part of this stimulating and con - structive exchange and look forward to more interaction of this type in the future . Hahn . My article starts by suggesting that a focus on treatment effects simpli(cid:142) es the problem of causal inference in limited dependent variable ( LDV ) models with endoge - nous regressors . Endogeneity’s half - sister is the assumption of unobserved individual effects , since the omitted - variables motivation for (cid:142) xed effects in panel data is similar . Hahn asks whether a shift in focus from index parameters to aver - age causal effects might also simplify the notoriously dif(cid:142) - cult problem of working with nonlinear models for binary panel data ( e . g . , as in Card and Sullivan 1988 ) . Hahn shows that here too the causal - effects framework pays off , demon - strating that average causal effects are easily estimated in a (cid:142) xed - effects probit model with a binary regressor even though the probit coef(cid:142) cient is not . A second noteworthy feature of Hahn’s comment is his observation that identi(cid:142) cation in this framework turns on careful modeling of the relationship between the assignment variable and the (cid:142) xed effects . Tradi - tional econometric models are primarily concerned with the stochastic process generating outcomes . A shift of attention toward modeling the assignment mechanism is consistent with the notion that observational studies should try to mimic the sort of controlled comparisons generated by experiments . Imbens . Imbens begins by endorsing the view that the sub - stantive goals of empirical research are better served by the potential outcomes / causal framework than by structural mod - eling . Going one step further , Imbens notes that the problems with “model - (cid:142) rst econometrics” are not limited to LDV’s . In the same spirit , he sensibly wonders ( as did Wooldridge 1992 ) why so much attention has been devoted to estimating the Box – Cox transformation model , which does not actually iden - tify E6Y — X7 without a distributional assumption . Imbens also nicely articulates the rationale for looking at the twins exam - ple and notes that this is similar to the rationale for extrap - olating from clinical trials in narrow subpopulations . And , in fact , I believe the “twins experiment” is likely to have pre - dictive value in a variety of situations , though any extrapo - lation will probably be improved by control for demographic characteristics . In spite of ( or perhaps because of ! ) our years of discussion and collaboration , Imbens and I still do not agree on certain things . He feels strongly that inference with discrete outcomes should use models and procedures that respect inherent non - © 2001 American Statistical Association Journal of Business & Economic Statistics January 2001 , Vol . 19 , No . 1 28 Journal of Business & Economic Statistics , January 2001 linearities . The HIRZ procedure discussed in his comment is an intriguing way to do this , and my article discusses others . I remain unconvinced , however , that nonlinearity is of major substantive importance in empirical work with binary regres - sors . The proof of the pudding , I suppose , would be to show that HIRZ or some of the methods I discuss in the article lead to better predictions or decisions than the linear workhorse . Mof(cid:142)tt . Mof(cid:142) t provides a valuable counterpoint . He begins by arguing that latent - index models have more predictive power than reduced - form causal models . Such claims seem hard to establish a priori , though I do not doubt that in some cases this may be true . But empirical strategies in which the bulk of the research effort goes into estimating index coef(cid:142) - cients may fail to answer the most basic question in empirical work : What happened here ? Causal models and local aver - age treatment effect ( LATE ) answer this question , while index coef(cid:142) cients alone are not suf(cid:142) cient for causal inference . I agree , however , that structural modeling can be useful for going beyond basic questions , and I have used index and other structural models for this purpose . Mof(cid:142) t is right , however , in suggesting that I (cid:142) nd the model - free analysis he refers to as “exploratory” more interesting than structural extrapolation . This seems to me to be where the potential for real discovery lies . Mof(cid:142) tt asks tough but fair questions about the twins appli - cation . He is correct to point out that twinning is not a manip - ulable policy instrument . That is one reason I do not limit the analysis to reduced - form effects of multiple births . Yet , to my mind , the best evidence we have on the controversial question of the consequences of out - of - wedlock childbearing comes from the twins experiment ( Bronars and Grogger 1994 ) . And the economic consequences of childbearing are of interest in many other contexts . As noted in the introduction to my arti - cle , the twins experiment can help determine whether fertility reductions are responsible for trend increases in female labor supply . Beyond this sort of question , the twins results seem useful for assessing the economic consequences of increased abortion access in the United States , the dissemination of con - traceptive implants in developing countries ( e . g . , see Kane , Farr , and Janowitz 1990 ) , and various programs to encour - age or require implant use by welfare mothers ( Haveman and Wolfe 1993 ) . Finally , it is fair to question the external validity of twins estimates , as Mof(cid:142) t does toward the end of his comment . Angrist and Evans ( 1998 ) showed that the labor - supply con - sequences of twinning can be reconciled with estimates of the labor - supply consequences of childbearing resulting from a very different natural experiment induced by preferences for mixed - sex sibling pairs . This suggests that results from both experiments may be quite robust and may even be “structural” in the sense that they tell us something general about the eco - nomic response to childbearing . Mullahy . Mullahy brings a welcome health economist’s perspective to the discussion . Health economists have long grappled with the issues discussed in my article and , as I hope I made clear , I drew ideas and inspiration from Mullahy’s work on models with nonnegative dependent vari - ables . Mullahy’s comment further highlights exactly the sort of utilitarian trade - off that underlies the choice of empirical strategy . On one hand , we would like our models to be con - sistent with any functional form restrictions known to be true . On the other , attempts at this may complicate estimation and inference , for little payoff . Worst of all , the technical complex - ity of nonlinear models seems to cause authors to “wax econo - metric , ” an effort that may come at the expense of attention to substantive issues of importance ( an example here is the long series of papers discussing exactly how data from the RAND health - insurance experiment should be analyzed ) . Mullahy’s heretical discussions of “one - part models , ” here and in earlier work , represent a refreshing effort to keep the empirical train on track . Mullahy’s point that application - speci(cid:142)c distribution ordinates can provide more useful summary information than quantiles is also clearly worth thinking about . Todd . Todd provides a useful and clear overview of the causal framework , which she suggests is better suited for medical questions than economic questions . The thrust of her argument is that there is too much heterogeneity in economic interventions and outcomes for the causal approach to be very useful for economists . But my perception is that medical research is even more explicitly concerned with heterogene - ity than economics . This is evidenced by the many quali(cid:142) ca - tions regarding patient characteristics , conditions , and inter - actions in medical treatment protocols . A difference between the prevailing medical research paradigm and the traditional econometric perspective , however , is whether the question of heterogeneous response is to be addressed by better theory or more evidence . Of course , theory helps us decide where to look for heterogeneity , but as Rosenbaum ( 1999 , p . 301 ) put it : “If a treatment has substantially different effects in dif - ferent types of people , then we need to discover this ( ital - ics mine ) . Rosenbaum also noted that “randomized clinical trials routinely look for heterogeneous treatment effects , and they do this without representative samples from national populations . ” On the technical side , Todd suggests I advocated use of the two - part model because it (cid:143) exibly approximates nonlinear functional forms for nonnegative outcomes . Although I noted the (cid:143) exibility , the upshot of my discussion was that the two - part model is poorly suited to causal inference because of the dif(cid:142) culty of interpreting part 2 . Finally , Todd points out the failure to allow for sampling variance in the scaling factors used to generate effects for nonlinear models . This is indeed a hard - to - defend shortcut , though I shall take a stab at defense by noting that randomness of the scaling factor , which typi - cally estimates a sample average , is likely to be a minor source of sampling uncertainty .
