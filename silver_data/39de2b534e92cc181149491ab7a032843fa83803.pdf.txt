Dynamic Shaping of Cellular Membranes by Phospholipids and Membrane - Deforming Proteins .

Subcellular structures , including clathrin - coated pits , caveolae , ﬁlopodia , lamellipodia , podosomes , and other intracellular membrane systems , are molded into their speciﬁc submicron - scale shapes through various mechanisms . Cells construct their micro - structures on plasma membrane and execute vital functions for life , such as cell migration , cell division , endocytosis , exocytosis , and cytoskeletal regulation . The plasma membrane , rich in anionic phospholipids , utilizes the electrostatic nature of the lipids , speciﬁcally the phosphoinositides , to form interactions with cytosolic proteins . These cytosolic proteins have three modes of interaction : 1 ) electrostatic interaction through unstructured polycationic regions , 2 ) through structured phosphoinositide - speciﬁc binding domains , and 3 ) through structured domains that bind the membrane without speciﬁcity for particular phospholipid . Among the structured domains , there are several that have membrane - deforming activity , which is essential for the formation of concave or convex membrane curvature . These domains include the amphipathic helix , which deforms the membrane by hemi - insertion of the helix with both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions , and / or the BAR domain superfamily , known to use their positively charged , curved structural surface to deform mem - branes . Below the membrane , actin ﬁlaments support the micro - structures through interactions with several BAR proteins as well as other scaffold proteins , resulting in outward and inward membrane micro - structure formation . Here , we describe the characteristics of phospholipids , and the mechanisms utilized by phosphoinositides to regulate cellular events . We then summarize the precise mechanisms underlying the construction of membrane micro - structures and their involve - ments in physiological and pathological processes . I . INTRODUCTION 1219 II .

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTSTANDING . . . 1239 I . INTRODUCTION Life on earth emerged through the appearance of self - seal - ing , curved , semipermeable membranes , which separate the inside of a structure from the outside environment . Cells are separated from the exterior by membrane envelopes , and thus need to uptake nutrients and excrete wastes through these barriers to sustain the dynamic activities necessary for life . Furthermore , cells have to recognize changes in the surrounding environment and communicate signals across their membranes , which is especially important for multi - cellular organisms . To consistently execute these vital func - tions under variable conditions , cells regulate the shape of their membranes in a way that reﬂects the speciﬁc needs of the cell in that environment and / or cellular event ( e . g . , cell migration , cell division , endocytosis , exocytosis , and cyto - skeletal regulation ) . Our current knowledge of these cellu - lar structures has been pioneered by using electron micros - copy , which enables the visualization of the membrane mi - cro - structures of individual cells . Recently , evidence concerning the molecular mechanisms underlying the for - mation of these ﬁne micro - membrane structures has been revealed . Eukaryotic cells contain intracellular membrane systems , whereas most noneukaryotic cell types only have a plasma membrane and no intracellular membranes . The internal membranes of eukaryotic cells generally contain numerous bends , resulting in high levels of membrane curvature . On Physiol Rev 94 : 1219 – 1248 , 2014 doi : 10 . 1152 / physrev . 00040 . 2013 1219 0031 - 9333 / 14 Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 5 on A p r il 2 0 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m the other hand , the plasma membrane ( PM ) by itself is a large , relatively ﬂat structure but contains multiple ﬁne mi - cro - membrane structures , that add high levels of curvature to the ﬂat PM . These PM structures include outward pro - trusions , such as ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia , as well as in - vaginations , such as clathrin - coated pits and caveolae , all of which occur through the deformation of a limited area of the PM . The process of shaping the membrane is generally thought to be initialized by the generation of concave ( pos - itive ) or convex ( negative ) membrane curvature , resulting in invaginations and protrusions , respectively . It is increas - ingly recognized that the formation of these areas of mem - brane curvature is induced by a variety of protein - driven mechanisms ( 3 , 140 , 174 , 184 , 255 , 258 , 274 ) . Most PM curvature studies have focused on the cytosolic proteins that utilize electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to interface with the negatively charged phospholipids ( 3 , 17 ) . The phospholipids that form cellular membranes consist of a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head group . Major phospholipids possessing the negatively charged head group include phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) , and its phosphorylated de - rivatives , phosphoinositides . PS and PA are thought to be constitutive components of membranes . PI is also present in high amounts at the cellular membrane . However , the head group of PI contains electrically neutral myo - inositol , and thus PI is not generally considered to contribute to the mod - ulation of cellular functions . In contrast , phosphoinositides are generated enzymatically by the phosphorylation of PI through various PI kinases such as PI 3 - kinases , and down - regulated by PI phosphatases such as PTEN , processes de - pendent on intracellular signaling in response to extracellu - lar stimuli . The inositol ring of PI can be phosphorylated on the hydroxyl groups at C - 3 , C - 4 , and C - 5 positions in dif - ferent combinations , generating seven different phosphoi - nositides . The presence of multiple phosphate groups in the inositol ring results in much stronger negative charges , (cid:2) 2 per one phosphate , than that for PS and PA , both of which contain net charge of (cid:2) 1 at neutral pH ( FIGURE 1 A ) . With these characteristics and dynamic production dependent on stimuli , phosphoinositides are considered to be fundamen - tal lipid species for regulation of cellular processes . These phosphate modiﬁcations of inositol allow speciﬁc recognition by phosphoinositide - binding proteins . The structural folds of these proteins provide pockets for vari - ous patterns of inositol ring phosphorylation , which allow them to recognize speciﬁc phosphoinositides ( FIGURE 1 B ) . These domains that recognize speciﬁc phosphoinositides in - clude pleckstrin homology ( PH ) , Phox ( PX ) , and epsin NH 2 - terminal homology ( ENTH ) and are found in proteins that act for signal transduction cascades ( 10 , 23 , 50 , 292 ) . In contrast , there are proteins with structural fold , but without speciﬁc recognition of phosphoinositides . The Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) domain superfamily , which include proteins containing BAR , N - BAR , FCH - BAR ( F - BAR ) , and inverse - BAR ( I - BAR ) domains , bind phospho - inositides without strict recognition of the phosphate at the inositol ring . The structural fold of BAR domains is rather used to sense and / or to generate tubule - like structures of phosphoinositide - containing liposomes and cellular mem - branes ( 3 , 174 , 255 ) . However , the structural fold of the proteins is not always necessary for the binding of proteins to phosphoinositide or anionic lipids . Some proteins have the clusters of basic amino acid residues lacking a structural fold ( poly - cationic motif ) that are responsible for lipid binding through nonspeciﬁc electrostatic interactions ( 155 , 291 ) . When we observed the cellular membrane , the PM is sup - ported and stabilized by the cortical actin cytoskeleton , which is formed and recycled through regulated polymerization and depolymerization processes . Interestingly , the lipid - binding proteins provide the connection between membrane curvature and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . For example , the BAR domain superfamily proteins , which sense and / or induce the curvature of the membrane , often interact with proteins that regulate actin reorganization ( 280 , 293 ) . Thus the forma - tion of ﬁne micro - membrane structures is thought to be orga - nized by the binding of membrane - deforming proteins to neg - atively charged lipids , which leads to the interaction and con - centration of actin polymerization regulators . In this review , we describe the characteristics of membrane phospholipids , with an emphasis on phosphoinositides , and then the mechanisms utilized by phosphoinositides to reg - ulate a variety of cellular events through their binding mo - tifs and domains . We also discuss the relationship between phospholipids and the mechanisms underlying the organi - zation of membrane curvature and micro - membrane struc - ture formation , mainly focusing on the PM . II . MEMBRANE PHOSPHOLIPIDS A . Localization of Various Phospholipids in the PM The PM is mainly constructed of phospholipids . The phos - pholipids form a bilayer ( (cid:3) 5 nm in thickness ) by utilizing their amphipathic characteristics , with the polar head groups facing the water and the hydrophobic fatty acyl chains facing each other on the interior of the bilayer . Many different types of phospholipids can be accommodated into a single bilayer , and the lipid composition is expected to inﬂu - ence the physiological functions of the membrane ( FIGURE 1 ) . The four primary phospholipids found in eukaryotic mem - branes are phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) , phosphatidylethano - lamine ( PE ) , PS , and sphingomyelin ( SM ) . In addition , two less abundant species , PI and PA , can also exist in the mem - branes . We still cannot exclude the existence of trace amount of other phospholipids , of which function is less SUETSUGU ET AL . 1220 Physiol Rev (cid:129) VOL 94 (cid:129) OCTOBER 2014 (cid:129) www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 5 on A p r il 2 0 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m characterized ( 246 ) . In addition , PI is used as a source of various trace amounts of “phosphorylated phosphatidyl - inositol , ” known as phosphoinositide ( 10 ) . The various types of lipids show asymmetric distribution in the inner and outer leaﬂets of the PM lipid bilayer . PC and SM are predominantly localized in the outer membrane , whereas PE is primarily found in the inner membrane ( 64 , 136 ) . Fur - thermore , PS is exclusively found in the inner leaﬂet of the PM along with PI and several phosphoinositides , including PI 4 - phosphate [ PI ( 4 ) P ] , PI 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] , and PI 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate [ PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ] ( 23 , 50 ) . The phospholipid composition also varies in each cell type and membrane ( 155 , 308 ) . In eukaryotic cells , PC , PE , and SM comprise 45 – 55 , 15 – 25 , and 5 – 10 % of the total quantity of lipids , respectively ( 308 ) , while PS and PA only account for 2 – 10 and 1 – 2 % , respectively . On the other hand , PI represents (cid:3) 10 – 15 % , while phosphoinositides are only present as trace amounts and are generally less abundant by one order of magnitude . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is the most abundant phosphoinositide and com - prises (cid:3) 0 . 5 – 1 % of the total quantity of lipids , while the amounts of other phosphoinositides are even lower . Although the number of phosphoinositides present in the membrane is very low , they nonetheless play important roles in receptor - activated signal transduction as they are generated ( phosphorylated ) and degraded ( dephosphory - lated ) in a signal - dependent manner . It is well known that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is hydrolyzed by phospholipase C to generate two second messengers , inositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) and – – P P – – P P – – P P – – P P – – P P + + – – – – PPP A B – Flat bilayer Electrostatic interaction e . g . , poly - cationic region Lipid - binding domain e . g . , PH domain , PX domain , ENTH domain , etc .

Phospholipid shape and the associated mechanism of membrane recognition and deformation . A : the shape of a lipid molecule is classiﬁed into three categories : cylindrical , conical , and inverted conical . Alone , each type of lipid will form a unique membrane structure ; however , actual membranes , such as lipid bilayers , are composed of a mixture of these three types of lipids . Even taking into account the different lipid shapes , biological membranes are , overall , relatively ﬂat when compared with the submicron scale structures , such as clathrin - coated pits . B : the protein domains that recognize and bind to lipids are currently classiﬁed into four categories : 1 ) simple , charge - driven interactions without recognition of speciﬁc lipid species ; 2 ) lipid species recognition by the protein structure ; 3 ) membrane recognition and deformation with the insertion of an amphipathic helix or a hydrophobic loop ; and 4 ) protein structure - based deformation of the membrane ( e . g . , BAR domains ) . SHAPING OF CELLULAR MEMBRANES 1221 Physiol Rev (cid:129) VOL 94 (cid:129) OCTOBER 2014 (cid:129) www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 5 on A p r il 2 0 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m diacylglycerol ( DAG ) ( 13 ) , in response to receptor activa - tion . Furthermore , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 acts as a key player in PI 3 - kinase signaling through PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - binding domains ( 309 ) . Other phosphoinositides also regulate a wide variety of membrane functions and interact with multiple cytosolic proteins , which are described in detail below . Although phosphoinositides may play major roles in a wide range of cellular events , PA has also been shown to bind the polyca - tionic motifs of Rac and DOCK2 , a Rac GTP - exchange factor , leading to Rac activation ( 23 , 192 ) . The distribution of PS and phosphoinositides causes the elec - trostatic properties of the membrane to vary ( 17 ) . Membranes of the early secretory pathway [ e . g . , endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and cis - Golgi ] have a weakly charged cytosolic leaﬂet due to the scarcity of PS and phosphoinositides . In contrast , mem - branes of the late secretory pathway ( e . g . , endosome and PM ) have a highly charged cytosolic leaﬂet because of their abun - dance of PS and phosphoinositides ( 17 ) . The electrostatic na - ture of PS allows it to act as a partial substitute for phosphoi - nositides in membranes , especially during the interaction with cationic motifs . Membrane - deforming domains , such as BAR , F - BAR , and I - BAR , are one such example of cationic motifs that adapt to curved anionic membrane surfaces using electro - static interactions ( 3 ) . However , these domains seem to prefer PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PS ( 173 , 174 ) . Therefore , phosphoinositides , rather than PS , are the preferred phospholipids for many pro - teins , likely owing to their stronger charge . This preferential interaction has made phosphoinositide a major player in con - trolling the construction of ﬁne membrane structures utilized for a variety of cellular functions , including cell migration , membrane trafﬁcking , and cell proliferation ( 50 , 173 ) . B . Roles of the Phospholipid Head Group and Fatty Acid Tail Phospholipids constituting the majority of lipid bilayers have a variety of polar head groups , differing in size and charge . For example , the polar heads of PE are smaller than those of PS , PC , and SM , whereas phosphoinositides have very large polar heads because of the presence of the phos - phate - bearing inositol ring ( FIGURE 1 A ) . The size of the polar head group causes each of these lipid types to form different structures ( 127 ) . PE is deﬁned as a conical - shaped lipid and by itself forms a structure with negative curvature , similar to the inverted hexagonal phase of tubes , with the head groups on the inside and the hydrophobic tails on the outside ( FIGURE 1 A ) . In contrast , PI and phosphoinositides have an inverted conical shape and form structures with positive curvatures . PC , PS , and SM are cylindrical - shaped lipids , which preferentially form ﬂat bilayer structures . In the eukaryotic PM , PC and PS are the most common con - stituents of the outer and inner leaﬂets , respectively . PC and PS alone form ﬂat or gently curved planar membranes in vitro , but PE , cholesterol , and phosphoinositides cannot form bilayers without other lipids . Furthermore , the pres - ence of these lipids causes destabilization of the planar membranes formed by PC and PS , which seems to be re - quired for vesicle budding , fusion , and other shape changes involving biological membranes ( 127 ) . Therefore , local ac - cumulation of these lipids in specialized areas of the PM can modulate the membrane shape with their physical proper - ties , electrostatic nature , and through the recruitment of membrane - binding proteins . Lipid geometry also depends on the acyl chains , particularly the presence of double bonds that produce a kink in the middle of the chain ( 17 ) . For example , the oleoyl chain consists of 18 carbons with one double bond ( C18 : 1 ) and occupies a larger volume than a palmitoyl chain ( C16 : 0 ) that consists of 16 carbons without any double bond . Thus the size of the polar heads and species of acyl chain inﬂuence the lipid packing of membranes . Furthermore , cholesterol , while not a phospholipid , is also abundant in the PM and is a particularly unique component because it is amphipathic , with a polar hydroxyl group and a hydrophobic planar steroid ring . These properties allow it to intercalate between the phospholipids , with its hydroxyl group near the polar head groups and its steroid ring parallel to the acyl chains of the phospholipids , thus improving lipid packing . The PM contains phospholipids with relatively high - saturated fatty acids as well as high levels of cholesterol allowing for tight lipid packing . In contrast , the ER is characterized by loose lipid packing due to the abundance of unsaturated phos - pholipids and scarcity of cholesterol . PI and phosphoinositides contain high levels of polyunsat - urated fatty acids , predominantly consisting of 1 - stealyl and 2 - arachidonyl acyl chains . An arachidonyl chain ( C20 : 4 ) has four double bonds , and therefore , its acyl chain bends sharply . The large polar head group and abundance of arachidonic acid in phosphoinositides cause them to dis - turb lipid membrane packing and , in regions of the mem - brane where phosphoinositides are concentrated , larger spots of lipid - packing defects may be formed . Indeed , brain PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ dominantly 1 - stearyl - 2 - arachidonyl PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] was found to be a potent modiﬁer of lipid bilayer when gramicidin A channels’ sensitivity to changes in lipid bi - layer properties was measured ( 233 ) . Furthermore , cyto - solic proteins seem to interact electrostatically with loosely packed lipids more easily than closely packed lipids ( 16 , 18 , 170 , 178 ) . In contrast to the loose - packing nature of individual phosphoinositide molecule , phos - phoinositides mixed with other phospholipids in a global cellular membrane are known to form phosphoinositide - enriched microdomains ( 156 , 226 ) . These microdomains are thought to be further stabilized or reinforced in the presence of phosphoinositide - clustering proteins ( 173 , 234 ) . Thus cytosolic proteins are probably more apt to access and interact with phosphoinositides that are con - centrated at these “hot spots . ” SUETSUGU ET AL . 1222 Physiol Rev (cid:129) VOL 94 (cid:129) OCTOBER 2014 (cid:129) www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 5 on A p r il 2 0 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m C . Speciﬁc Localization of Each Phosphoinositide There are seven phosphoinositides found in mammalian cells ( FIGURE 2 A ) : PI 3 - phosphate [ PI ( 3 ) P ] , PI ( 4 ) P , PI 5 - phosphate [ PI ( 5 ) P ] , PI 3 , 4 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ] , PI 3 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ] , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . The type of phosphoinositide can be identiﬁed by determin - ing the combination of phosphate groups at three sites ( po - sitions 3 , 4 , and 5 ) in the inositol ring . These phosphoi - nositides are synthesized from PI and localize at the re - stricted membranes ( 50 ) . Main phosphoinositides found at the PM are PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and less abundant PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , but each has its own speciﬁc localization pattern within the PM ( FIGURE 2 B ) .

PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 are exclusively localized at the PM . The most abundant phosphoinositide , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , is mainly syn - thesized by PIP5K from PI ( 4 ) P , which is synthesized from PI by PI 4 - kinase . The formed PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is further synthesized to PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 by type I PI 3 - kinase or de - graded to two second messengers , DAG and IP 3 , by phospholipase C in response to extracellular stimuli . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is formed from PI ( 4 ) P by types I and II PI ( 4 ) P 3 - ki - nases or from PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 by PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 5 - phosphatases , such as SHIP1 , SHIP2 , and SKIP .

PI ( 3 ) P , PI ( 4 ) P , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 were detected with the Fyve domain of Hrs and the PH domains of Fapp1 , PLC (cid:2) 1 , Tapp1 , and Grp1 , respec - tively .

Recently , the role of PI ( 4 ) P at the plasma mem - brane as a pool of anionic phospholipid was discovered ( 99 ) . The least characterized PI ( 5 ) P is found on the PM , in endosomes , and in the nucleus ( 263 ) . It is noteworthy that each phosphoinositide can be found outside of its well - known subcellular location . For example , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is found in the nucleus and is thought to regulate gene expres - sion ( 177 ) . The different localization of phosphoinositides in each organelle assists in the targeting of particular pro - teins to distinct membranes through the speciﬁc binding domains unique to each type of phosphoinositide . This sub - cellular localization of each phosphoinositide is mostly de - termined by its lipid kinases and phosphatases that are spa - tially restricted to speciﬁc membranes ( 119 , 243 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is mainly synthesized from PI ( 4 ) P by PI ( 4 ) P 5 - ki - nase ( PIP5K ) , which consists of three isoforms , PI ( 4 ) P5K (cid:4) , PI ( 4 ) P5K (cid:5) , and PI ( 4 ) P5K (cid:6) ( 243 ) . Although there is a syn - thetic pathway to form PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 from PI ( 5 ) P , PI ( 5 ) P is very rare . Therefore , most PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is generally considered to be generated from PI ( 4 ) P . Degradation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is known to produce two second messengers , IP 3 and DAG , when cells are activated by extracellular stimuli ( 13 ) and is an important step in the inositol lipid signaling system . In this reaction , receptor - activated phospholipase C is used to hy - drolyze PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to IP 3 and DAG . On the other hand , there are two types of phosphatases , 5 - phosphatase and 4 - phos - phatase , that dephosphorylate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to mainly control steady - state levels . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is the most abundant phospho - inositide and presumably plays a pivotal role in cytoskele - ton remodeling , endocytosis , and membrane deformation , which are induced by the interaction between the PM and certain cytosolic proteins ( 23 , 50 , 52 , 83 , 234 ) . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is formed from PI ( 4 ) P by class I and II PI 3 - kinases or through the dephosphorylation of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 by PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 5 - phosphatases , such as SHIP1 , SHIP2 , and SKIP . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is hydrolyzed to PI ( 3 ) P or PI ( 4 ) P by 4 - phos - phatases , such as INPP4A and INPP4B , or the 3 - phospha - tase PTEN ( FIGURE 2 A ) . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 serves as a localization signal for the construction of podosome / invadopodia and as a regulator for the circular dorsal rufﬂe formation on the membrane ( 105 , 193 , 195 ) . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is present in negligible levels under resting con - ditions , but in response to various extracellular stimuli , it is synthesized at the PM from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by class I PI 3 - kinases ( 72 , 221 , 309 ) . Interestingly , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is selectively pres - ent at the leading edge of the cells . In polarized epithelial cells , it is abundant in the basolateral membrane , but absent in the apical membrane ( 167 ) . Furthermore , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 re - cruits cytosolic proteins to the PM through interaction with speciﬁc PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - binding domains , particularly those containing PH domains . The aberrant accumulation of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , which can be caused by loss of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 3 - phosphatase activity or an elevation in PI 3 - kinase activity , causes a variety of diseases . For example , PTEN mutant mice develop several types of cancer ( 49 ) , and disruption of the SHIP2 gene causes these mice to develop modiﬁed insulin signaling ( 268 ) . The pre - cise mechanisms causing these diseases are not yet clear , but based on these data , it is hypothesized that the development of each disease occurs through the altered functions of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in different cellular compartments . III . PHOSPHOINOSITIDE - BINDING PROTEINS A . Electrostatic Interactions Between Phosphoinositides and Cytoskeletal Proteins Phosphoinositide binding at cationic - charged regions rich in basic amino acid residues has been observed for a variety of cytoskeletal proteins ( 253 ) . Importantly , a lot of actin regulatory proteins contain basic amino acid residues that can in fact interact with phosphoinositides , mainly PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Although the net charge of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is less than that of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , the contribution of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to the surface charge of the membrane is presumably low because of the lower amount of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 found in the membrane compared with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has been shown to in - teract with multiple actin regulatory proteins , including vinculin ( 79 , 89 ) , talin ( 106 , 296 ) , (cid:4) - actinin ( 79 , 80 ) , coﬁlin ( 327 ) , gelsolin ( 126 ) , Ezrin - Radixin - Moesin ( ERM ) ( 111 ) , and other actin regulatory proteins . The binding of phos - phoinositides to the actin regulatory proteins regulates the rearrangement of cortical actin ﬁlaments , which support the membrane deformation to construct ﬁlopodia and la - mellipodia . Furthermore , this binding also activates G - actin nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) , including neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) and WASP - homologous verprolin homology protein 2 ( WAVE2 ) , both of which are known to be ubiquitously expressed in the cell ( 293 ) . These data suggest that inositol lipid signaling inﬂu - ences the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and mem - brane morphology through changes in the levels of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the PM . Indeed , increased expression of PI ( 4 ) P5K (cid:4) induces massive actin ﬁlament formation ( 257 ) , while expression of synaptojanin , a phosphoinositide phos - phatase , causes disruption of actin ﬁlaments ( 240 ) . Taken together , it appears that an increase in the level of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 tends to promote actin ﬁlament formation , whereas a de - crease in the level of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 leads to actin depolymeriza - tion ( 125 ) . Notably , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is unexpectedly concentrated in lipid rafts ( 90 , 114 , 210 ) , where Rho - and ADP - ribosylation fac - tor ( Arf ) - GTPases facilitate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - synthesizing PI 5 - ki - SUETSUGU ET AL . 1224 Physiol Rev (cid:129) VOL 94 (cid:129) OCTOBER 2014 (cid:129) www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 5 on A p r il 2 0 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m nases by inducing the recruitment of these kinases to these sites in the PM . Thus actin assembly can be initiated with remarkable efﬁciency at these PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich rafts through the enhanced recruitment and activation of WASP and ERM proteins , leading to the promotion of the actin polym - erization and actin ﬁlament assembly ( 92 ) . Thus PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - regulated rearrangement of actin ﬁlaments in compartmen - tally restricted areas of the PM seems to concentrate all of the factors necessary for micro - structure formation . B . NPFs , N - WASP and WAVEs , Are Activated by Phosphoinositides in Combination With Other Factors When cells start to migrate in response to chemoattractants , rapid actin polymerization is induced at the leading edge to form ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia . Such rapid actin polymer - ization is also necessary for forming other micro - membrane structures , such as endocytic pits . In resting cells , the barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments are capped by large redundant pro - teins to prevent spontaneous elongation of the ﬁlaments . Therefore , to trigger rapid new actin polymerization during the rearrangement of the cortical cytoskeleton in response to extracellular stimuli , cells must form actin nuclei from which new ﬁlaments can be polymerized . Thus actin polym - erization takes place through two steps : actin nucleation and polymerization . First , the actin monomer ( G - actin ) forms an actin trimer , which serves as a seed or nucleation site for the polymerization . This step is time - consuming and is the rate - limiting step in de novo actin polymerization . Once a trimer is formed , the actin ﬁlament elongates from the barbed end depending on the concentration of G - actin . However , to induce quick actin polymerization at the lead - ing edge of migrating cells in response to a stimulus , the time required for the nucleation step has to be shortened ( 200 , 212 , 283 ) . NPFs that shorten the time required for a trimer formation have been discovered ( 231 , 293 ) and in - clude two WASP family proteins , WASP ( 286 ) and N - WASP ( 179 , 180 ) , and three WAVE family proteins , WAVE1 , - 2 , and - 3 ( 181 , 282 ) . Importantly , these proteins are also phosphoinositide - binding proteins . N - WASP is anchored and activated by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the PM in the presence of Cdc42 , inducing quick actin polymeriza - tion using the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 228 ) . N - WASP also has several multifunctional domains , including a WASP homol - ogy 1 ( WH1 ) domain , a basic region , a GDB / CRIB motif , a proline - rich region , and a verprolin - homology , coﬁlin - like , and acidic domain ( VCA ) region ( 293 ) . The WH1 region is essential for association with WIP / CR16 / WICH ( or WIRE ) proteins , which are important for stabilization of N - WASP or WASP ( 134 , 168 , 222 , 279 ) . The basic region of N - WASP is the domain used to bind to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which serves as an anchor point on the membrane . The VCA region , in which the V region binds to actin monomers and the CA region binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex , is the domain that plays an important role in shortening nucleation time . The Arp2 / 3 complex includes actin - like proteins , Arp2 and Arp3 ( 212 ) . Therefore , when two Arps of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex and one actin monomer are gathered on the platform of VCA in N - WASP , the time - consuming nucleation pro - cess is skipped . However , it has been shown that full - length N - WASP does not activate the Arp2 / 3 complex as strongly as the VCA domain does alone , suggesting that the VCA region is masked in inactive N - WASP . Interest - ingly , the addition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and Cdc42 appears to unmask the VCA region , which consequently leads to the binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex to N - WASP , resulting in fast actin nucleation ( 137 , 180 , 228 ) . The Arp2 / 3 com - plex further assembles actin ﬁlaments from the sides of already existing ﬁlaments , thus forming branched , mesh - like actin ﬁlaments ( 22 , 77 ) . However , N - WASP forms straight actin ﬁlaments , such as ﬁlopodia and actin rods , in cells . Therefore , it is thought that actin bundling proteins probably reform the branched ﬁlaments into straight ﬁlaments after the branched - actin ﬁlaments are generated by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 21 , 310 ) . It is interesting that ﬁlopodia - like structures can be reconsti - tuted with N - WASP and Toca - 1 or other BAR proteins , which have membrane - deforming abilities ( 152 ) . It is likely that Toca - 1 is recruited to the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - enriched area and then activates N - WASP by its membrane - deforming activity ( 287 ) . In muscle , N - WASP can form unbranched ﬁlaments by using the multiple actin monomer - binding sites of Nebu - lin , the SH3 - containing protein that binds to N - WASP . In this case , trimer assembly is thought to be mediated by the V region and Nebulin in forming the straight ﬁlaments ( 288 ) . Unlike N - WASP , WAVE is anchored and activated by PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in the presence of Rac , forming lamellipodia - like actin ﬁlaments ( 196 , 281 ) . There are three isoforms of WAVE : WAVE1 , - 2 , and - 3 . All WAVEs also have a VCA region through which they activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 293 ) . However , WAVEs are activated differently than N - WASP . Activation occurs by PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and Rac binding , inducing lamellipodia and membrane rufﬂe formation . WAVE1 – 3 can form a pentameric protein complex with HSPC300 / BRICK , Abi1 , Nap1 , and Sra1 / PIR121 ( 34 , 120 ) . When cells are activated by chemoattractants or growth factors , they form lamellipodia at the leading edge where PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is concentrated ( 112 ) , indicating that the WAVE proteins , particularly the abundantly and ubiqui - tously expressed WAVE2 isoform , are essential for lamelli - podia formation in this context ( 325 ) . WASP and WAVE family proteins play crucial roles in membrane deformation during endocytosis and formation of outward protrusions by supporting the structures and generating force by de novo actin polymerization . In addi - tion to these NPFs , other NPFs have been recently discov - SHAPING OF CELLULAR MEMBRANES 1225 Physiol Rev (cid:129) VOL 94 (cid:129) OCTOBER 2014 (cid:129) www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 5 on A p r il 2 0 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m ered , but mainly function in intracellular trafﬁcking . These NPFs include WASP and SCAR homolog ( WASH ) , WASP homolog associated with actin , membranes , and microtu - bules ( WHAMM ) , and junction - mediating and regulatory protein ( JMY ) . Currently , it is unclear whether these pro - teins are related to the membrane - deforming proteins , though WASH complex is found to associate with dynamin and endosomal BAR protein , sorting nexin 1 / 2 ( SNX 1 / 2 ) ( 47 , 93 ) . These new NPFs are discussed in further detail in other reviews ( 69 , 230 ) . C . Phosphoinositide - Binding Domains A variety of membrane - associated proteins have phospho - inositide - binding domains with binding pockets for partic - ular phospholipids . These domains recognize phospho - inositides with structural speciﬁcity ( 9 , 291 ) . Among them , the PH domain was the ﬁrst phosphoinositide - binding do - main reported and is conserved among a large number of proteins in the human proteome ( 103 ) . The other phospho - inositide - binding domains are PX ( 31 , 133 , 323 ) , Fab1 , YOTB , Vac1p , and EEA1 ( FYVE ) ( 84 , 202 ) , ENTH ( 71 , 125 ) , AP180 NH 2 - terminal homology ( ANTH ) ( 154 , 275 ) , some of PDZ such as those found in Syntenin , PTP - BL , CASK , and Tiam - 1 ( 335 ) , Tubby ( 242 ) , Dock homology region 1 ( DHR - 1 ) ( 41 ) , GOLPH3 ( 51 , 321 ) , some of C2 such as those found in synaptotagmin and PLAs ( 37 , 38 , 45 ) , band 4 . 1 , Ezrin , Radixin , and Moesin ( FERM ) ( 111 , 191 ) , and glucosyltransferase , Rab - like GTPase activator , and myotubularin ( GRAM ) domains ( 12 , 301 ) . Some of these phosphoinositide - binding domains show spe - ciﬁc and high - afﬁnity binding to a particular phosphoino - sitide . For example , PLC (cid:2) 1 PH domain speciﬁcally binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 as well as its head group IP 3 ( 103 ) . The PH do - main of Grp1 binds exclusively to PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , while that of Akt / PKB binds both PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( 73 , 143 ) . Tapp1 and Fapp1 PH domains speciﬁcally bind to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PI ( 4 ) P , respectively ( 54 ) . The PH domain speciﬁcity has enabled the construction of probes used to detect the local - ization of these phosphoinositides ( FIGURE 2 B ) ( 122 , 193 ) . Other than PH domain , GOLPH3 , which consists of only one domain , speciﬁcally binds to PI ( 4 ) P ( 51 , 321 ) . How - ever , the lipid recognition of the PH domains is generally less strict compared with that of other domains discussed here . The PH domains that recognize PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , or PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 are involved in functions important during a va - riety of events in the PM . For example , once the PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 hot spots are formed in the PM by the activation of PI 3 - kinase , Akt / PKB is recruited to the PM through the PH domain and is activated . Akt / PKB is a serine / threonine ki - nase that binds to PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 through its NH 2 - terminal PH domain ( 73 , 298 ) and is activated by phosphorylation at Thr - 308 and Ser - 473 . Furthermore , activated Akt / PKB modulates a wide range of cellular functions , such as cell survival , proliferation , polarity formation , cortical actin regulation , and glucose metabolism . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 also mod - ulates the activities of Cdc42 and Rac through the PH do - mains of their guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , such as Tiam1 ( 241 ) and Vav ( 100 ) , leading to membrane rufﬂe formation . Lipid speciﬁcity is also observed for the other phospho - inositide - binding domains . The ENTH domain speciﬁcally binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 125 ) . PI ( 3 ) P is enriched in early endo - somes and acts as a recruiter of PI ( 3 ) P - binding proteins to this site , and the FYVE domains of early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) and hepatocyte growth factor - regulated tyrosine kinase substrate ( Hrs ) show exclusive , high - afﬁnity binding to PI ( 3 ) P . However , the FYVE domain of protrudin local - izes to endosome and binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( 87 , 262 ) . The PX domains of SNX3 , NADPH oxidase component , and p40 phox also bind to PI ( 3 ) P rather than PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( 31 , 56 , 133 , 319 , 323 ) . On the other hand , the p47 phox PX domain binds both lipids , but binds more strongly to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . A new lipid - binding domain , SH3YL1 , Ysc84p / Lsb4p , Lsb3p , and plant FYVE protein ( SYLF ) domain , was re - cently identiﬁed in SH3YL1 protein ( 104 ) . This domain preferentially binds to PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . Furthermore , this do - main contains an amphipathic (cid:4) - helix in the NH 2 terminus , which has the capability to deform liposomes into vesicles ( 104 ) . The role of amphipathic helices in membrane defor - mation is described in further detail in a later section . The SYLF domain has been found to play an important role in forming circular dorsal rufﬂes ( CDRs ) , which are charac - terized by short - lived , dynamic , ring - shaped F - actin - en - riched structures thought to be involved in motile cell po - larity formation , macropinocytosis , and the internalization of cell surface receptors . Interestingly , the formation of mi - cro - membrane structures , such as CDRs and podosomes / invadopodia , has been shown to require PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 in com - mon ( 104 , 193 ) . In CDR formation , SH3YL1 is recruited to the dorsal PM region where PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is newly generated in response to receptor stimulation . Then , Arf - GTPase ac - tivating protein ( GAP ) with a Rho - GAP domain , an ankyrin repeat , and a PH domain 1 ( ARAP1 ) is gathered to PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - enriched sites through its PH domain , and its Arf GAP activity is activated . Since SH3YL1 forms a pro - tein complex with the PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 5 - phosphatase SHIP2 , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 at CDRs is hydrolyzed to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . These data indicate that ARAP1 is ﬁrst activated by the increase in PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and then becomes inactivated by its hydrolysis to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . Thus this phosphoinositide conversion leads to the transition of the nucleotide - binding state of Arfs from a GDP - bound ( CDR expansion ) to a GTP - bound form ( CDR closure ) , which controls the size of the CDRs through the regulation of ARAP1 substrates , Arf1 and Arf5 ( 105 ) . Therefore , conversion of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is not only SUETSUGU ET AL . 1226 Physiol Rev (cid:129) VOL 94 (cid:129) OCTOBER 2014 (cid:129) www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 5 on A p r il 2 0 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m required for CDR formation but also regulates the dynamic movement of CDRs . Furthermore , Rac is suggested to be activated by Tiam1 ( Rac GEF ) , which is known to be acti - vated by PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , at the early endosome and is then delivered to the CDRs ( 198 ) where it is involved in the rearrangement of actin ﬁlaments during CDR formation . It is clear that several of the phosphoinositide - binding do - mains have the capability to deform liposomes into tubules and small vesicles . For example , the ENTH domain de - forms PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing liposomes to small vesicles by inserting its NH 2 - terminal amphipathic helix into the mem - brane . Furthermore , the BAR , F - BAR , and I - BAR domains preferentially bind to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , allowing them to deform PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - enriched membranes into vesicles and tubular - like structures , although they can generally bind negative - charged phospholipids , such as PS . As discussed later , some BAR and F - BAR domain - contain - ing proteins are accompanied by an extra lipid - binding do - main , such as PH and PX domains . The presence of neigh - boring PH and PX domains may help to target the protein to sites where a particular phosphoinositide exists . The membrane deforming activity of BAR , F - BAR , and I - BAR domains is highly dependent on lipid - binding ability , and lipid - binding deﬁcient mutants lose membrane - deforming activity . IV . GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEMBRANE CURVATURE FORMATION The mechanisms of membrane deformation can be classi - ﬁed into three categories : lipid metabolism , protein scaf - folding , and binding protein insertion / interaction ( 174 ) . The representative proteins that are involved in membrane deformation are summarized in TABLE 1 . A . Lipid Metabolism The shape of each lipid molecule , cylindrical , conical , or inverted conical , is different ( FIGURE 1 A ) . Enrichment of inverted conical or conical lipids is thought to drive mem - brane deformation . This enrichment can be achieved by increased lipid metabolism , which is mediated by the syn - thesis and / or transport of new lipid molecules to the mem - brane . The metabolism - mediated mechanisms include the enzymatic conversion of precursor lipids to usable forms as well as the addition of the head group onto the lipid back - bone . The production of phosphoinositides with relatively large head groups might by itself be enough to induce mem - brane curvature , but the low concentration of phosphoi - nositides in the PM indicates that this is not the primary method used to alter global membrane curvature . However , phosphoinositides do appear to afford such effects locally in concentrated areas of the PM , such as clathrin - coated pits , caveolae , and near membrane receptors . Another metabolic mechanism employed to alter membrane curvature utilizes the hydrolysis of the acyl chain , which removes one of the two acyl chains in the lipid molecule . For example , PA is normally a conical lipid , but lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) is an inverted conical lipid . Therefore , conversion of PA to LPA is assumed to induce curvature formation . It was pro - posed that PA - hydrolyzing activity of endophilin was one of such example . However , the activity was the contaminant from the source of the protein puriﬁcation , and indeed the membrane deformation was mediated by the BAR domain of endophilin described later ( 82 ) . The transport of lipid molecules to induce membrane curva - ture can be mediated by ﬂippases , which induce lipid asymme - try between hemi - layers during cytokinesis and cell migration ( 57 , 58 ) . During apoptosis , type IV P - type ATPases ( P4 - ATPases ) and CDC50 family proteins form a putative phos - pholipid ﬂippase complex used for the translocation of PS and PE ( 135 ) , exposing PS to the outer leaﬂet of the PM , which normally does not contain PS . Furthermore , the lipid scramblase , transmembrane protein 16F ( TMEM16F ) , can also perform Ca 2 (cid:4) - dependent scrambling of membrane phospholipids , resulting in the exposure of PS to the cell surface leading to apoptosis ( 285 ) . However , the full mech - anism of such enzymatic regulation and its precise effects on membrane curvature are still unclear . B . Indirect Protein Scaffolding Membrane deformation using the scaffold - mediated mech - anism was ﬁrst found for caged vehicles , such as clathrin - coated pits , which can be pinched off to form clathrin - coated vesicles . Clathrin coats are involved in clathrin - me - diated endocytosis from the PM to form endosomes . Clathrin coats are not membrane - binding proteins , but they are connected to the membrane through adaptor proteins ( APs ) or cargo proteins ( 3 , 50 ) . On the other hand , COPI / II coats are involved in vesicle transport between the ER and the Golgi apparatus . Some components of COPI / II coats directly bind to the membrane , but GTPases such as Arf play important roles for COPI / II assembly on the mem - brane ( 3 , 50 ) . In both cases , the formation of rigid lattice scaffolds , involving both the APs / cargo proteins as well as the secondary binding proteins , is thought to be the struc - tural determinant of such caged vesicles . The membrane curvature formation can also be just trig - gered by the assembly of proteins on the membrane without speciﬁc membrane binding properties . This mechanism is recently proposed as protein “crowding” for curvature for - mation ( 140 , 246 , 273 ) . In this case , the assembly of pro - teins on the membrane with some anchoring to the mem - brane can bend the membrane . However , the existence of crowding mechanism in vivo is still unclear . The protein assembly of , for example , AP protein complex at the clath - rin - coated pit might be considered to be such example ( 273 ) .

The actin ﬁlaments exist in high den - sity beneath the plasma membrane , and thus can be thought to be a mechanism for indirect protein scaffolding for mem - brane curvature formation . The elongating barbed ends of polymerizing actin ﬁlaments are thought to push membrane by their ﬁlling of the space between the ﬁlaments and ﬂuc - tuating membrane , where the ﬁlling by actin ﬁlaments func - tions as “ratchet” for membrane protrusion ( 68 , 174 , 273 ) . C . Binding Protein Insertion / Interaction There are two mechanisms of membrane deformation that occur through the direct binding of the proteins to the mem - brane . One utilizes the electrostatic interactions between the lipid - binding domains on the protein surface and the negatively charged lipids at the membrane . Two well - known classes of proteins with structural folds conducive to this type of electrostatic interaction are the BAR domain - containing proteins ( BAR proteins ) and the endosomal sort - ing complexes required for transport ( ESCRT ) proteins . The recently identiﬁed BAR proteins are thought to deform membranes primarily by electrostatic interaction followed by the recruitment of other membrane - modifying proteins . The ESCRT proteins utilize their electrostatic interactions with the membrane to function in membrane budding , which is essential for releasing virus vesicles to the outside of the cells as well as the biogenesis of membrane organelles containing vesicles , otherwise known as the multivesicular body ( 8 , 108 , 188 ) . The details of ESCRT - mediated mem - brane changes are described in depth in other reviews ( 118 , 219 ) . Direct protein insertion into the membrane is another mechanism used to alter membrane curvature . This mech - anism of membrane deformation was ﬁrst characterized for proteins containing an amphipathic helix , whereby the cy - lindrical helix is laid down on the membrane , exposing the hydrophilic surface to the cytosol ( 3 ) ( FIGURE 1 B ) . Although the exposure of this surface prevents the penetration of the helix into the membrane , like that of a transmembrane pro - tein , the hydrophobic surface alone is still inserted into the hemilayer of the membrane , thereby enlarging the area of the inner leaﬂet of the bilayer and causing membrane defor - mation . If the hydrophilic surface is positively charged , the helix interacts with anionic phospholipids in the cytosolic layer of the membrane , while inserting the other side into the hydrophobic interior , which is the case for the ENTH domain of epsin and the N - BAR domain of amphiphysin and endophilin ( FIGURE 3 ) . The positively charged , unstruc - tured amino acids in the NH 2 - terminal region of the ENTH domain , in combination with the structure region of the domain , interact speciﬁcally with the head group of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The interaction of ENTH domain and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membrane then turns the last 17 residues into an amphipathic helix , which is then inserted into the mem - brane ( FIGURE 3 ) ( 32 , 71 , 125 , 328 ) . Furthermore , if the hydrophilic surface of the helix does not have a strong charge , then the helix has a tendency to func - tion as a sensor for membrane curvature , capturing the vesicles for intracellular vesicle transport . Such a sensor function has been found in the amphipathic lipid packing sensor ( ALPS ) motif of the ArfGAP1 , which is involved in COPI coat disassembly ( 19 , 55 ) . ALPS motifs have been found in proteins associated with the nuclear envelope ( Nup133 ) , the ER ( Atg14L ) , and the cis - Golgi ( ArfGAP1 , GMAP - 210 ) and thus seem to be involved in the events of the early secretory pathway ( 3 ) . The ALPS motif of Arf - GAP1 is unstructured in solution , but inserts its bulky hy - drophobic residues between loosely packed lipids , and forms an amphipathic helix on highly curved membranes . This helix appears to favor insertion at sites of lipid packing defects that arise in the external leaﬂet of a liposome when its curvature increases . Furthermore , the ALPS / ArfGAP1 helix differs from classical amphipathic helices , as there is an abundance of serine and threonine residues on its polar face . Thus ALPS motifs favor curvature and lipid - packing defects rather than curvature and electrostatic interactions . These ALPS motifs are characterized by their secondary amphipathic helix structures and are not related to a speciﬁc amino acid sequence ( 19 , 55 ) . In addition to amphipathic helices , proteins with stretches of hydrophobic residues are also known to form loop / wedge - shaped insertions into the membrane , inducing de - formation . Caveolins and reticulons are examples of such membrane - embedded proteins that , after interacting with the membrane , undergo oligomerization to generate curva - ture . Furthermore , self - assembly of caveolin and reticulon can induce membrane remodeling to create plasma mem - brane invaginations and tubulate the ER ( 52 , 255 , 259 , 273 , 312 ) . A similar protein structure is also found in ﬂo - tilin , which is a scaffold protein involved in a less - charac - terized clathrin - independent endocytic pathway ( 52 , 255 , 312 ) . There are two additional important examples for mem - brane deformation mediated by membrane insertion . One is the eps15 homology ( EH ) domain - containing proteins 2 ( EHD2 ) protein . The EHD2 protein is known to oligomer - ize , and this oligomerization and the insertion appear to be essential for membrane deformation ( 43 ) . The C2 domain from several proteins , such as synaptotagmin , Doc2a / b , and group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A 2 ( cPLA 2 (cid:4) ) , induces and / or senses membrane curvature likely through mem - brane insertion , which occurs in Ca 2 (cid:4) - dependent manner ( 117 , 166 , 317 , 331 ) . The roles and mechanisms of C2 domain - mediated membrane deformation are discussed in other reviews ( 155 , 175 ) .

THE BAR DOMAIN SUPERFAMILY A . Identiﬁcation of BAR Proteins BAR proteins are classiﬁed as having a BAR ( N - BAR ) , F - BAR , or I - BAR domain depending on their sequence ( TABLE 1 ) . However , all BAR proteins are composed of a helix bundle , where three helices of one monomer form into a dimer , producing a six - helix bundle that displays various degrees of intrinsic curvature ( FIGURE 3 ) . Thus the struc - tural classiﬁcation of these three BAR domain subfamilies is less important . However , the important distinction be - tween BAR proteins is in the degree of curvature innate to each BAR domain , which allows a cell to generate a large range of varying curvature when utilizing a scaffolding mech - anism . In all BAR domains , the positively charged residues are enriched at a particular surface of the dimer , identifying it as the membrane contact site ( 280 ) . With the exception of the I - BAR proteins , the membrane contact surface is found on the concave side ( or the inside of the arc - shaped protein dimer ) . Considering only the dimer of the BAR domains , most BAR domains are thought to ﬁt with negatively charged lipid membranes through their positive concave face ( FIGURES 1 B AND 3 ) . Furthermore , they induce mem - brane tubulation in vitro . Importantly , the membrane tu - bules formed by the BAR proteins in these experiments are topologically the same as those found in the membrane invaginations of in vivo plasma membranes . It is still unclear whether BAR domains actually deform the membrane in cells directly or rather sense the mem - brane and then recruit other membrane - deforming pro - teins . However , membrane deformation and membrane sensing cannot be distinguished in cells . The sensing and deformation would be inherently linked processes , and one may be the other under different conditions . It has been experimentally shown that puriﬁed BAR proteins can deform the membrane in vitro , but it seems that the concentration of the BAR proteins appears to distinguish its deforming and sensing activities ( 271 ) . Furthermore , in a model experiment where a nanofabricated pattern was applied onto the plasma membrane , the BAR pro - teins appeared to be recruited upon membrane deforma - tion , thus supporting the curvature sensing ability of the BAR proteins ( 81 ) . Interestingly , the BAR domains from amphiphysin and Rvs161 / 167 have putative amphipathic helices at both ends of the dimer units of the BAR domain and are thus called N - BAR domains ( 208 ) . The amphipathic helix , in conjugation with the concave structure , is important for its ability to sense and induce membrane curvature . Hence , the N - BAR module plays a dual role in regulating membrane curvature . Insertion of NH 2 - terminal amphi - pathic helices into membranes causes changes in lipid packing and effectively creates local membrane curva - ture . Thus the NH 2 - terminal amphipathic stretch plays pivotal roles in membrane tubulation and shallow helical fold insertion into the membrane . The scaffolding and loop / wedge insertion mechanism are independent of each other ; however , both are thought to work simultaneously to induce membrane curvature . In addition , the amphi - pathic helix can also function as a sensor for membrane curvature as it acts as an anchor for the membrane and can sense high levels of positive curvature as in case of ALPS motif . Thus N - BAR proteins also could sense curved membrane domains by probing the surface for lipid packing defects . Other than that found in am - phiphysin , there are only a small number of other BAR domains that have such insertions . For example , the en - dophilin BAR domain has a similar amphipathic helix at the end of its dimer , but also has a helix at the middle of its dimer ( FIGURE 3 ) ( 169 ) . The PACSIN1 / Syndapin I and PACSIN2 / Syndapin II F - BAR domains also have the membrane insertion loops at the membrane interacting surface ( FIGURE 4 A ) ( 261 , 315 ) . The missing - in - metasta - sis ( MIM ) I - BAR domain also causes the membrane in - sertion ( 234 ) . However , the other BAR domain has not been reported to have such a membrane insertion mech - anism . Epsin ENTH domain , which has a hydrophobic insertion , is apt to form small vesicles and extremely narrow tubules . In contrast , BAR domain scaffolds generally induce mem - brane tubulation . However , N - BAR domains , which have both insertions and BAR domain scaffolds , can generate a mixture of vesicles and tubules . In fact , an increased num - ber of amphipathic helices on a BAR domain correlates with increased vesiculation and smaller vesicle size , driving membrane scission ( 24 ) . Moreover , a high concentration of BAR domains with amphipathic insertions has been shown to induce vesiculation of liposomes ( 24 , 91 ) . In terms of physical chemistry , each lipid molecule is thought to adapt itself to an energetically lower state . It might be reasonable to assume that the lower state is achieved by the vesicula - tion of the tubulated membrane . It is likely that the high degree of membrane curvature generated by a hydrophobic insertion can make phase separation of membrane lipids by clustering speciﬁc lipids , which probably leads to the for - mation of boundaries between lipid clusters on the mem - brane ( 232 , 267 ) . This boundary might function as cutting line for vesiculation or scission of the membrane ( 4 , 11 , 158 , 232 ) . It is proposed that shallow hydrophobic inser - tions are sufﬁcient for vesicle formation , driving membrane ﬁssion , whereas crescent - like protein scaffolds , such as BAR domains without amphipathic helix or loop insertion sup - port formation of membrane tubules , hence disfavoring ﬁs - sion . B . Clathrin - Mediated Endocytosis The most extensively studied function of BAR domains in - volves clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) ( 23 , 161 ) .

It is hypothesized that ﬁrst , an F - BAR protein with shallow curvature , FCHo1 / 2 , is re - cruited , which initiates the assembly of the clathrin - coated pits ( FIGURE 4 A ) ( 107 , 305 ) . Then , F - BAR proteins , such as FBP17 and PACSINs , are recruited , followed by BAR do - mains with signiﬁcant curvature , such as endophilin and amphiphysin ( 23 , 142 , 295 ) . The FCHo1 / 2 proteins are unique among the BAR proteins because they do not have the SH3 domain found in other BAR proteins , but instead , FHCo1 / 2 has a motif for binding to epsin and other mole - Lamellipodia Filopodia Clathrin coated pit formation ( in mammals ) Dynamin Plasma membrane FCHo2 FBP17 SNX9 Amphiphysin Endophilin PACSIN2 Clathrin Transverse section actin and the Arp2 / 3 actin IRSp53 Lamellipodia Filopodia Clathrin coated pits Epsin B B B B P P P P B p l a s m a m embrane A B C D time actin B P B p l a s m a m e m b r a n e P P P P P B BB BB B BB BB Arp2 / 3 complex NPF ( e . g .

The other BAR pro - teins , including those recruited at the clathrin - coated pits after FCHo1 / 2 , have the SH3 domain that can bind to dy - namin and N - WASP . Dynamin is an essential protein that causes the mechanical scission of the clathrin - coated pits into clathrin - coated vesicles and has been shown to coop - erate with BAR proteins during membrane scission ( FIGURE 4 A ) ( 176 , 190 ) . Furthermore , the sequential recruitment of BAR proteins at the clathrin - coated pits is also observed in yeast ( 131 ) , and while a dynamin - like molecule does exist in yeast , it is not essential for scission of clathrin - coated pits . Instead , WASP - homolog - mediated actin polymerization plays an essential role during this process ( 272 ) . However , detailed understanding of how this sequential recruitment is regulated is currently limited . It is known that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 plays a crucial role in CME . Clathrin - coated pit formation is initiated in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - en - riched membranes , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is essential for the early steps in CME , namely , nucleation , cargo selection , and coat assembly , whereas the latter steps , such as scission and un - coating , depend on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 elimination . A lot of proteins associated with clathrin - coated pits bind directly to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , but clathrin does not . The clathrin - binding pro - teins , such as epsin and AP180 , have ENTH and ANTH domains , respectively , that interact with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Classi - cal BAR domain - containing proteins , such as endophilin and amphiphysin , also bind to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and can deform PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membranes ( 329 ) . However , it should be noted that BAR domains generally do not recognize PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 speciﬁcally , rather bind to membrane with elec - trostatic interactions . Furthermore , dynamin also binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through its PH domain . After the early steps of CME are complete , endophilin is thought to recruit the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphatase synaptojanin , which depletes PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 from the clathrin - coated pits , thereby inducing clathrin uncoating and scission ( 207 , 249 ) . Thus the CME process is closely regulated by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Furthermore , the BAR proteins appear to ﬁnely regulate actin polymerization during CME , depending on the mem - brane size and structure . The ﬁrst example , demonstrating the dependency of actin polymerization on the size of the membrane , indicated that actin polymerization by Toca - 1 and FBP17 in combination with N - WASP was affected by the diameter of the liposome ( 287 ) . The curvature - depen - dent formation of actin ﬁlaments was also observed when actin polymerization was induced by the BAR - PX domain of SNX 9 on phosphoinositide - coated silica beads of a de - ﬁned curvature ( 83 ) . In this case , the actin ﬁlaments were found to be elongated toward the neck of constricting clath - rin - coated pits ( FIGURE 4 C ) ( 40 , 277 ) . Therefore , actin po - lymerization was found to push the membrane in analogous ways during both ﬁlopodia , lamellipodia , and clathrin - coated pit formation , presumably under the regulation of a diverse set of BAR domain proteins ( FIGURE 4 , B AND D ) ( 280 ) . Along with the BAR proteins , N - WASP is thought to induce actin polymerization at the clathrin - coated pits , as indicated in the several examples described above ( FIGURE 4 , A , C , AND D ) ( 40 ) . However , N - WASP - mediated actin polymerization by itself is not required for endocytosis in cultured cells under normal conditions without mem - brane tension . Notably , this actin polymerization is re - quired for endocytosis under membrane tension , presum - ably to support the membrane during scission ( 25 , 67 , 322 ) , indicating a context speciﬁc need for N - WASP - mediated polymerization . In addition to N - WASP , other actin regu - latory proteins , such as WAVE , formin , VASP , and Cobl , can also function downstream of the BAR proteins ( 74 , 78 , 94 , 150 , 250 , 326 ) . C . Other Invagination / Endocytotic Structures The involvement of BAR domain proteins in the formation of other membrane structures is less clear . Caveolae are ﬂask - shaped invaginations that are enriched in cholesterol , sphingolipids , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 76 , 258 ) . The major structural component of caveolae is the integral membrane protein caveolin , a membrane - embedded protein that undergoes oligomerization to generate curvature ( 229 ) . Caveolins have transmembrane domains that contain an amphipathic helix inserted into the bilayer ( 201 ) . This helix also binds cholesterol and could cause the raftlike lipid composition of the caveolae ( 61 ) . Recent work has identiﬁed a protein fam - ily associated with caveolae , which includes cavin1 – 4 . Cavin proteins interact with caveolin in mature caveolae , and the deletion of cavin results in the loss of caveolae ( 101 , 110 ) . Thus this cavin complex may function as a scaffold for caveolin and other components of caveolae . With regard to F - BAR - domain proteins , PACSIN2 was shown to be present in caveolae and appears to be impor - tant for morphogenesis of the caveolae structure ( 102 , 146 , 254 ) . Indeed , depletion of PACSIN2 results in the loss of morphologically deﬁned caveolae . Similar to the BAR pro - teins in the clathrin - coated pits , PACSIN2 binds to dynamin and N - WASP through its SH3 domain ( 102 , 254 ) . There is an Asn - Pro - Phe ( NPF ) motif in PACSIN2 that can bind to EHD2 ( 43 , 186 ) , which is thought to stabilize the caveolae through the association with actin ﬁlaments ( 276 ) , likely induced by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( FIGURE 3 ) ( 76 , 266 ) . Thus it is clear that PACSIN2 plays an important role in the formation of caveolae . Another F - BAR protein , NOSTRIN , is also re - ported to be localized at caveolae , although it is not clear speciﬁcally how NOSTRIN functions in this membrane structure ( 244 ) .

The clathrin - independent carriers ( CLIC ) and GPI - enriched endocytic compartments ( GEEC ) pathways play major roles in such uptake ( 141 , 235 ) . GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion ki - nase - 1 ( GRAF1 ) protein , which contains an NH 2 - terminal BAR domain , a PH domain , a Rho - GAP domain , a proline - rich domain , and a COOH - terminal SH3 domain , is shown to be important in coordinating small G protein signaling and membrane remodeling to facilitate internalization of CLIC / GEEC pathway cargoes ( 162 ) . In this pathway , GRAF1 localizes to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - enriched sites in the mem - brane via its NH 2 - terminal BAR and PH domains , and de - forms the membrane to facilitate endocytic intermediate formation . D . Intracellular Organelles The membranes of intracellular organelles have also emerged as a site of BAR domain function . For example , the PX - BAR domain of SNX18 is shown to function in au - tophagosome formation ( 144 ) . Furthermore , the endosome contains SNX1 , - 4 , - 8 , - 9 , and - 18 , all of which have BAR domains , and appear to be important during the formation of tubular networks and in endosome trafﬁcking ( 98 , 299 , 306 , 307 ) . Endosomes also contain adaptor protein con - taining a PH domain , phosphotyrosine - binding domain , and leucine zipper motif 1 ( APPL1 ) , which contains an NH 2 - terminal BAR domain , a central PH domain , and a COOH - terminal phosphotyrosine - binding ( PTB ) domain ( FIGURE 3 ) . The crystal structure of the BAR domain dimer of APPL1 revealed that it contains two four - helical bundles ( FIGURE 3 ) , whereas other BAR domain dimers have only three helices in each bundle ( 157 , 334 ) . The PH domain is located at the ends of the BAR domain dimer , and all of the BAR , PH , and PTB domains have shown preferential bind - ing to PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . The BAR - PH domain has also been shown to fold together , forming the binding site for the small GTP - binding protein Rab5 . The Golgi network also contains BAR proteins , such as Arfaptin , which is the BAR domain only protein and mod - ulates small GTPases , such as Arl and Arf , for Golgi traf - ﬁcking ( 86 , 294 ) . For example , Arfaptin 2 binds to Arl1 through its BAR domain ( FIGURE 3 ) and is then recruited to the Golgi membrane , where it induces membrane tubules . Interestingly , the Arl1 in complex with the BAR domain of Arfaptin 2 resides at a similar position as the PX domain in the PX - BAR unit of SNX9 ( FIGURE 3 ) ( 189 ) , suggesting a similar mechanism underlying BAR domain targeting to speciﬁc organelle membranes . E . Membrane Protrusions The protrusive structures found on membrane surfaces had previously been believed to be organized solely by the power of actin polymerization ( 160 ) . Therefore , it was sur - prising that membrane deformation was found to be , at least in part , mediated by BAR proteins . Currently , there are two classes of BAR proteins with protrusion forming ability , proteins containing an I - BAR , and some of the F - BAR domain - containing proteins , which comprise only a small population of the entire BAR protein superfamily . The I - BAR domain , which has a kink in the helix , was ﬁrst found in IRSp53 and then later discovered in MIM ( 172 , 284 ) . The kink produces the surface of the inverted mem - brane , to the opposite direction than do classical BAR do - mains . The I - BARs can deform membranes in vitro into protrusion - like shapes , consequently clarifying the role of I - BAR domain in negative curvature formation ( FIGURE 3 ) . However , it is still uncertain whether such membrane de - formations are actually taking place in vivo , although sev - eral researchers have concluded that I - BAR proteins are localized at and involved in the formation of ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia ( 1 , 20 , 251 ) ( FIGURE 4 B ) . In other words , it is still unknown whether protrusions forming independently from actin ﬁlaments actually exist in the natural cellular environment . As Ahmed et al . ( 1 ) pointed out , the artiﬁcial ﬁlopodia induced by the I - BAR domain in cell culture and the “genuine” ﬁlopodia observed in vivo show distinctively different dynamics : the former is relatively stable and less motile with a lifetime of more than 10 min , compared with the latter with a lifetime of 79 – 142 s . Importantly , the full - length IRSp53 has the scaffolding ability to generate actin - mediated forces , which may explain the differences in the ﬁlopodia dynamics . The relative contribution of curva - ture - sensing , - generating , and scaffolding is currently un - known , and further studies are necessary to provide addi - tional insight into the mechanism of IRSp53 - mediated ﬁlopodium formation . Recently , another I - BAR function has been proposed in Drosophila , where I - BAR proteins indirectly help protru - sion formation by preventing invagination for endocytosis from occurring at these membrane sites ( 218 ) . In addition , Pinkbar , a relative of IRSp53 , has more ﬂat surface for membrane interaction and functions in generating planar membrane sheets in intestinal cells ( FIGURE 3 ) ( 213 ) . Another class of BAR domains with protrusion - forming activity was found in srGAP proteins that were classically called as Slit - Robo GTPase activating proteins . The srGAP family of proteins consists of four family members , srGAP1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , which have from the NH 2 terminus an F - BAR domain , a Rho - GAP , and an SH3 domain . Although each family member contains a GAP domain , there are differ - ences in GTPase activity between the proteins . The Rho - GAP domain of srGAP1 has been shown to promote GTP hydrolysis of Cdc42 and RhoA ( 320 ) , whereas the GAP domains of srGAP2 and srGAP3 are both speciﬁc for Rac1 ( 97 , 269 ) , and srGAP4 can act on both Cdc42 and Rac1 ( 311 ) . All four family members display spatially and tem - SUETSUGU ET AL . 1234 Physiol Rev (cid:129) VOL 94 (cid:129) OCTOBER 2014 (cid:129) www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 5 on A p r il 2 0 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m porally distinct patterns of expression in the central nervous system ( 5 , 70 ) and have been shown to regulate cell migra - tion and neuronal morphology in mammalian cells . Surpris - ingly , the overexpression of the F - BAR of srGAP2 did not cause invagination , but instead led to outward protrusions along the cell surface ( 29 , 42 , 59 , 97 ) . As well , srGAP1 and srGAP3 induce ﬁlopodia formation , although they are less potent than srGAP2 . And incubating this domain with li - posomes caused deformations of the membrane similar to those created by the IRSp53 I - BAR domain in vitro . These data were unexpected because F - BAR domains , in general , had been believed to induce positive membrane curvature . However , it is plausible that the F - BAR domain of srGAP functions like I - BAR , although there is no reported struc - ture for the F - BAR domain of those proteins to corroborate this hypothesis . Thus this family of Rho - GAP is now de - ﬁned as inverse F - BAR ( IF - BAR ) , which is functionally dis - tinct from other F - BAR domains . Recent studies show that the F - BAR - containing srGAP fam - ily of proteins can regulate dendritic spine morphogenesis . Dendritic spines , small bulbous protrusions found on neu - ronal dendrites , are postsynaptic structures that receive in - puts from axons . Spine formation , remodeling , and shape change are associated with the brain’s ability to store and process information in response to an experience . With the use of primary cultures of neurons , both srGAP2 and sr - GAP3 were shown to promote dendritic spine maturation , presumably by facilitating dendritic ﬁlopodia formation at the site of developing spines ( 29 , 30 ) . The overexpression of the GAS7 F - BAR domain has also been reported to induce cellular protrusions , which are suggested to be related to neurite extension ( 330 ) . However , the mechanisms of these relationships remain unclear because the structures have not been solved yet . The Fes or Fer proteins had ﬁrst been characterized as mem - bers of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases , which play important roles for intracellular signal transduction for cell adhesion and migration ( 95 ) . The Fes or Fer proteins have the F - BAR domain , SH2 domain , and tyrosine kinase do - main . The Fes or Fer has a recently characterized neighbor - ing FX domain . Whereas the F - BAR domain of Fer alone is not sufﬁcient for membrane binding , the FX domain is found to be required for efﬁcient binding . Furthermore , the FX domain speciﬁcally binds to PA , but not PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and functions in concert with the F - BAR domain ( 124 ) . Indeed , the addition of PA seems to enhance the tyrosine kinase activity of Fer in vitro , and phospholipase D ( PLD ) - gener - ated PA appears to serve as an activator in response to extracellular stimuli , since tyrosine kinase activation was suppressed by the addition of PLD inhibitors . Furthermore , the FX domain may be important for targeting the F - BAR domain of Fer to the lamellipodia formation sites in the membrane as the F - BAR - FX domain was found to be nec - essary for lamellipodia formation by Fer . F . How Is the BAR Domain Superfamily Regulated ? The BAR domain superfamily is unique in its structural characteristics and its structure - membrane curvature inter - actions . Therefore , because of their numerous biological functions , it is important to understand how the BAR do - main superfamily is regulated . A large number of cytosolic proteins are known to be activated and transduce signals upon phosphorylation or the addition of a charge to the protein . Recently , the BAR domains of ACAP4 have been reported to be activated by phosphorylation during mem - brane association in a manner dependent on epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) stimulation ( 333 ) . However , when we consider the increase of negative charge brought by phos - phorylation , the consequence might be the opposite , be - cause an addition of negative charge may enhance repulsion from anionic lipids of the membrane . Drosophila syndapin / PACSIN is also reported to be phosphorylated , but in this case , the phosphorylation inactivates the membrane tubu - lation ability ( 289 ) . Mammalian PACSIN1 and PACSIN2 are also reported to be phosphorylated , which results in defective neuronal morphologies and / or functions ( 2 , 217 ) . Because phosphorylation introduces a strong negative charge , it is assumed that the electrostatic membrane inter - actions are destroyed , thereby leading to weaker membrane afﬁnity . Autoinhibition is a widely used mechanism for the regula - tion of multidomain proteins . For example , N - WASP is regulated by the intramolecular interaction between the VCA and the CRIB motif ( 228 ) . This interaction is released by the binding of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and Cdc42 , thereby freeing the VCA to associate with the Arp2 / 3 complex . WAVE is also regulated by protein complex formation , where the VCA region is exposed through phosphorylation and binding of the small GTPase Rac ( 197 ) . However , among the BAR proteins , such autoinhibition has not been reported . Only one curious example is PACSIN1 , in which the SH3 domain is proposed to interact with the F - BAR domain intramo - lecularly ; however , the lack of a 1 : 1 stoichiometry for the F - BAR and the SH3 domains in the crystal structure indi - cates that this is a weak interaction ( 224 ) . It would not be surprising if the regulation of BAR proteins depended on molecule - molecule interactions ( i . e . , interac - tions with other proteins or lipids ) . This type of mechanism is known to be utilized in the regulation of SH3 binding proteins . In this process , if IRSp53 is phosphorylated by Par1b kinase or an unidentiﬁed kinase downstream of GSK3 (cid:5) , then the binding of the SH3 domain is hindered by the binding of 14 – 3 - 3 protein ( 39 , 130 , 227 ) . However , to date , no regulatory mechanism controlling the membrane deforming ability of the BAR proteins has been discovered . So far , it is not clear how BAR domain assembly , which is required for forming a stable membrane micro - structures , is SHAPING OF CELLULAR MEMBRANES 1235 Physiol Rev (cid:129) VOL 94 (cid:129) OCTOBER 2014 (cid:129) www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 5 on A p r il 2 0 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m regulated . Membrane bending due to thermal ﬂuctuation may be sufﬁcient for triggering BAR domain assembly . This initial BAR assembly likely results in the assembly of several additional molecules , which may lock the membrane into the conformational structure formed by the protein do - mains . In this case , BAR proteins are pure sensors of mem - brane curvatures , of which no particular regulation might be required . However , this theory has not yet been tested directly . If BAR proteins are actively engaged in the forma - tion of membrane curvature , then it is still unclear how the membrane deforming ability of the BAR proteins is regu - lated , even 9 years after the structural determination of the amphiphysin BAR domain . G . Higher Order Structure Assembly When we consider how proteins with positively charged surfaces and / or amphipathic helices deform membranes , it is not likely that a single molecule or single dimer could act alone to deform the membrane in such a speciﬁc and effec - tive manner . Instead , the assembly of many molecules at the same place of the membrane is certainly required for mem - brane deformation . For such assembly , it is quite reasonable to expect that the enzymatic production of phosphoinositi - des , such as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , would recruit membrane - deforming proteins . The assembly of several of these molecules may trigger the “polymerization” of membrane deforming pro - teins necessary for deﬁnite curvature generation ( 123 , 260 ) . In such a scenario , the concentration of the membrane - deforming protein will need to be fairly high , presumably in the micromolar range . When the structures of BAR , F - BAR , and I - BAR proteins were discovered , it was obvious that a dimer structure of the BAR domains was responsible for binding the protein to the curved membranes . However , BAR domains not only bind to membranes of the appropriate curvature to stabilize them , but can also act to deform membranes into such a shape ( 75 , 183 ) . Therefore , it is reasonable to suggest that major curvature deformations ( e . g . , protrusions , invagina - tions , etc . ) might be formed by the assembly of the BAR domains into chains , sheets , and / or spirals . Thus the shape of membrane contact surface is determined by not only the dimer unit structure , but also the assembly of higher order structures on the surface of the membrane . The ﬁrst example of higher order assembly formation found in nature was the putative ﬁlament formed by the F - BAR domains of CIP4 and FBP17 , where tightly packed F - BAR spirals were observed on the surface of the tubules ( FIGURE 3 ) ( 260 ) . Subsequent research has identiﬁed spiral forma - tion by endophilin and has further revealed some unique spacing patterns among the spirals of this endophilin assem - bly on the membrane tubules ( FIGURE 3 ) ( 183 ) . However , this ﬁlament formation was not clearly observed for other BAR domains . With regard to PACSIN1 and Pinkbar , the higher ordered structure is proposed to function for forma - tion of membrane curvature ( 213 , 224 ) . Especially , Trp141 of Pinkbar is shown to be involved in lateral contact for formation of planar sheet of the I - BAR domain . It is impor - tant to note that such insights into the assembly of BAR proteins into higher order structures are typically based on the protein packing observed in the crystalized form . In a crystal , the proteins must interact with each other to form a stabilized crystal structure , and the contact sites between molecules can be determined from the spatial organization of the proteins in these structures . However , it is still un - clear whether such higher order structures actually exist for the membrane - deforming proteins . Furthermore , the localization of the BAR protein is also expected to affect its ability to form higher order structures , and , importantly , proteins with similar structures do not necessarily localize in the same areas of the cellular mem - brane . For example , the F - BAR protein FBP17 is reported to localize at clathrin - coated pits ( 260 ) , while its homolog , CIP4 , can localize to lamellipodia ( 163 , 236 , 297 ) . In addi - tion , although the three PACSIN isoforms have a similar structure , PACSIN2 and - 3 were localized at caveolae , while PACSIN1 was not ( 254 ) . PACSIN2 is also involved in EGF receptor internalization , presumably through clathrin - coated pits ( 46 , 295 ) . These data suggest that the BAR domain is not the only determinant of BAR protein local - ization . Rather , the formation of a protein complex might be more important than the BAR domain - membrane inter - action for the localization of the protein . The exploration of BAR protein localization and assembly formation is limited by the current methods used to visual - ize live cells ( e . g . , microscope resolution and membrane / protein visualization methods ) . Furthermore , the diffrac - tion limit of a live cell also causes difﬁculties , as most of the membrane structures formed by BAR proteins are below this limit , thus preventing the use of conventional micros - copy to examine BAR protein - mediated deformation . Re - cently , superresolution microscopy , such as stochastic op - tical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) , photo - activated localization microscopy ( PALM ) , and structured illumina - tion microscopy ( SIM ) , has been used to try to overcome such limitations , and preliminary studies have been initi - ated to reveal how membrane structure is built up by cyto - solic proteins ( 14 , 116 ) . However , superresolution micros - copy is not without its own limitations , and although the membrane micro - structure probes can be rapidly devel - oped , the signal density still needs to be increased to effec - tively observe the shape of the membrane . However , this methodology represents a large step toward visualizing pro - tein expression and localization , as accomplished with con - ventional microscopy , in an electron microscopy - grade im - age of the cellular structures . This type of detailed visual - ization of proteins and membranes will be indispensable to SUETSUGU ET AL . 1236 Physiol Rev (cid:129) VOL 94 (cid:129) OCTOBER 2014 (cid:129) www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 5 on A p r il 2 0 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m increase understanding of the function and regulation of BAR proteins during membrane morphogenesis . VI . BAR PROTEINS AND DISEASE The members of the BAR protein superfamily play crucial roles in the formation of ﬁne membrane micro - structures , such as membrane protrusions , ﬁlopodia , lamellipodia , and endocytotic invaginations . Therefore , defects in the func - tion of these proteins are likely related to a variety of dis - eases . Cell culture and animal model knockout studies are powerful tools used to determine the physiological role of a protein in vivo . Here , we describe several BAR protein mu - tations connected to disease pathology as well as the phe - notypic consequences of lacking one or more BAR protein in a mouse model . A . Cancer Cancer cells have different morphology compared with the parental normal cells . Although the relationships between shape formation by BAR proteins and cancer formation is not clear , several reports showed the involvement of BAR proteins in cancer . The amphiphysin - like protein Bin1 has been reported to contribute to the Myc and Raf pathways which play a crucial role in apoptosis and senescence ( 214 ) , and one isoform appears to act as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting c - Myc . Loss of Bin1 in mosaic mice was also associated with overall organ tissue inﬂammation and an increased occurrence of lung and liver carcinomas ( 33 ) . De - letion of Bin3 has also been associated with increased lym - phomas in aging animals as well as juvenile cataract forma - tion , with a near total loss of F - actin in the lens ﬁber cells ( 220 ) . Numerous BAR proteins are known to be involved in po - dosome / invadopodia formation in cancer cells . Formation of these F - actin - rich ﬁngerlike membrane protrusions drives cell migration and invasion into the extracellular ma - trix ( ECM ) ( 185 ) . Podosomes / invadopodia were initially discovered in cells transformed with the Rous sarcoma virus as well as in monocyte - derived cells , such as osteoclasts and macrophages ( 44 , 164 , 165 ) . The BAR protein CIP4 has been shown to be localized at the leading edge and podo - somes and may be involved in ECM invasion ( 115 , 209 ) . In addition to CIP4 , FBP17 is also localized and appears to function in the podosomes ( 300 ) . Furthermore , both pro - teins have been shown to be involved in invadopodia for - mation in invasive breast and bladder cancer cells , respec - tively ( 209 , 324 ) , and CIP4 are expressed at high levels in the invasive breast cancer cell line MDA - MB 231 , while lower levels are found in the less invasive cell line MCF - 7 . It has been suggested that CIP4 expression promotes breast cancer cell invasion and invadopodia formation through the activation of N - WASP ( 209 ) . CIP4 is also expressed at abnormally high levels in chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) cells compared with normal B cells or other subtypes of B - cell malignancies . Experimental CIP4 knockdown in CLL cell lines causes decreased activa - tion of WASP , but increased activation of PAK1 and p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , resulting in im - paired lamellipodium assembly and loss of directional mi - gration ( 163 ) . In addition , overexpression of CIP4 in CLL patients seems to be associated with aggressiveness of the disease and a shorter survival . However , the inconsistent evidence is also reported . According to that report , CIP4 may function as a suppressor of Src - induced invadopodia and invasion in breast tumor cells by promoting endocyto - sis of MT1 - MMP ( 115 ) . Therefore , it is likely that CIP4 plays different roles dependent on the types of cancer cells . As well , CIP4 gene knockout mice only cause delayed and decreased endocytosis ( 65 ) . Although such partial suppres - sion of endocytosis probably implicates the redundancy of these proteins and limitation of knockout studies , CIP4 - mediated endocytosis might be involved in some forms of cancer progression . The BAR and GAP protein , ASAP1 , as well as the I - BAR protein IRSp53 are also involved in cancer cell podosome / invadopodia formation ( 15 , 194 ) . ASAP1 is an Arf - GAP known to regulate membrane trafﬁcking and actin cytoskel - eton organization ( 121 , 223 ) . It contains an NH 2 - terminal BAR domain , followed by a PH domain , an Arf GAP do - main , an ankyrin repeat , a proline - rich region , and an SH3 domain . On the membrane surface , ASAP1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP bound to Arf family GTP - binding pro - teins ( Arfs ) , preferably to Arf6 . Arf6 is localized at the PM where it functions in a wide range of processes , such as endocytosis , cytokinesis , and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , possibly through the action of increasing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis and Rho family G protein regulation ( 88 ) . The BAR domain of ASAP1 is critical for in vivo function of ASAP1 , and the PH domain selectively binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 129 ) . The PH domain is functionally integrated with the GAP domain , raising the possibility that the BAR domain affects GAP activity through the PH - BAR folding mechanism . It has also been reported that ASAP1 is a sub - strate of the tyrosine kinase Src and binds to a variety of actin regulatory proteins , including cortactin , which is a required component for podosome formation ( 15 ) . Indeed , ASAP1 , particularly the BAR domain was found to be re - quired for podosome formation in breast cancer cells and NIH 3T3 expressing active c - Src . Furthermore , such podo - some formation was inhibited by the overexpression of the BAR - PH domain ( 15 ) . These results suggest that the recog - nition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by the BAR - PH domains trigger subse - quent signaling events in podosome formation including the regulation of Rho family G proteins , the reorganization of actin ﬁlaments , and possibly the membrane curvature gen - eration . SHAPING OF CELLULAR MEMBRANES 1237 Physiol Rev (cid:129) VOL 94 (cid:129) OCTOBER 2014 (cid:129) www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 5 on A p r il 2 0 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Another phosphoinositide , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , is required for podo - some / invadopodia formation in a unique way . Tks5 / FISH , a scaffold protein , has been shown to play an essential role in invadopodia formation and is upregulated in invasive forms of cancer ( 252 ) . This protein consists of one PX do - main and ﬁve SH3 domains and binds through PX domain to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( 193 , 195 ) . Tks5 is essential for podosome / invadopodia formation in many different cell types ( 38 , 193 , 252 , 321 ) . However , it is not clear yet how Tks5 plays a role in the podosome / invadopodia formation . Recently , a new sequential model of invadopodia assembly is presented ( 242 ) based on high - resolution spatiotemporal live cell im - aging . According to that model , cortactin , N - WASP , coﬁlin , and actin arrive together to form the invadopodia precur - sor , followed by Tks5 recruitment . Tks5 then forms a com - plex with N - WASP , cortactin , coﬁlin , and actin . Next , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 gets enriched in a ring around the precursor core . SHIP2 , a PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 5 - phosphatase , also localizes at the invadopodia core and hydrolyzes PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 which anchors the Tks5 complex to the precursor core and stabilizes the invadopodia ( FIGURE 2 ) . The I - BAR domain - containing protein IRSp53 , which can produce negative curvature , may also act as a scaffold pro - tein , rather than a membrane - deforming protein , during podosome formation , although its full function is still un - clear ( 194 ) . IRSp53 consists of an I - BAR domain , a CRIB motif , and an SH3 domain . The CRIB motif binds to Cdc42 and the SH3 domain binds to Eps8 , N - WASP , WAVE2 , MENA , and VASP ( 251 ) , solidifying its potential as a scaf - fold protein , on which a variety of actin regulatory proteins can be assembled for inducing actin polymerization . Some BAR family proteins act as tumor suppressors . F - BAR - only protein , PSTPIP2 , antagonizes actin polymeriza - tion in the podosome by competing with FBP17 at the mem - brane ( 302 ) . Furthermore , the I - BAR containing protein MIM is present in normal tissues , but is missing in several metastatic cell lines , and this downregulation is associated with the progression of bladder transitional carcinomas ( 316 ) . Thus MIM has been proposed as a suppressor of metastasis genes in bladder cancer ( 153 ) . These accumulating evidences clearly indicate the involve - ment of BAR proteins in cancer . However , how the mem - brane morphology generated by the BAR protein relates to cancer formation remains unclear . B . Immune System Disorders Multiple F - BAR proteins affect immune cell function through their effects on membrane cytoskeleton remodel - ing . For example , an alternatively spliced form of CIP4 localizes in the phagocytic cup of RAW murine macrophage cells , indicating a potential function in phagocytosis ( 53 ) . Furthermore , CIP4 is necessary for integrin - dependent T cell trafﬁcking , and CIP4 - deﬁcient T lymphocytes cause im - paired T - cell - dependent antibody response , impaired con - tact hypersensitivity , and defective adhesion to immobilized VCAM1 and ICAM1 in endothelial cells , leading to im - paired transendothelial migration ( 148 ) . Two additional F - BAR proteins , PSTPIP1 and PSTPIP2 , containing an F - BAR and SH3 domain and a sole F - BAR domain , respectively , are also involved in immune function . PSTPIP1 recruits PTP - PEST to immune synapses where it negatively regulates the antigen - dependent activation of T cells . Point mutations of PSTPIP1 are found in conjunction with pyogenic sterile arthritis , pyoderma gangrenosum , and acne ( PAPA ) syndrome ( 318 ) , where the binding to PTP - PEST was markedly reduced . In contrast , the interaction of the mutated PSTPIP1with pyrin protein , which mediates the inﬂammatory response and is responsible for the famil - ial Mediterranean fever protein , was markedly increased ( 264 ) . PSTPIP2 also appears to be a negative regulator of the immune system as it antagonizes FBP17 by competing for membrane binding sites , resulting in the suppression of immune system hyperactivation ( 302 ) . PSTPIP2 point mu - tations and protein deﬁciency in mice in fact induce auto - inﬂammatory disease and exhibit a similar phenotype to chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis ( 35 , 66 , 96 ) . C . Muscle Disorders The membrane - deforming ability of the BAR proteins was pioneered by the study of amphiphysin with mutation de - fective in muscle formation . Amphiphysin is necessary for the organization of the excitation - contraction coupling ma - chinery ( t tubule ) , which is long invagination in muscles , but it is not necessary for synaptic vesicle endocytosis in Drosophila ( 225 ) . In mammals , mutation of amphiphysin 2 ( Bin1 ) causes autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy by interfering with the remodeling of t tubules and / or en - docytic membranes ( 152 , 225 ) . In this case , two missense mutations affecting the BAR domain disrupt the membrane tubulation properties in transfected cells ( 206 ) . Bin3 , consisting only of an N - BAR domain , is known to be required for proper formation of multinucleated muscles both in vitro and in vivo . During early myogenesis , Bin3 promotes migration of differentiated muscle cells , where it colocalizes with F - actin in lamellipodia . Importantly , Bin3 forms a complex with Rho GTPases , such as Rac1 and Cdc42 , which are essential for myotube formation ( 265 ) . Bin3 knockout mice showed the delayed muscle regenera - tion ( 265 ) . Interestingly , lack of Bin3 in differentiated mus - cle cells prior to myotube formation led to defects in lamel - lipodia formation and cell migration in addition to signiﬁ - cantly decreased levels of active Rac1 and Cdc42 . These data suggest a major role for a Bin3 - dependent signaling pathway in regulating Rac1 - and Cdc42 - dependent pro - cesses during myotube formation ( 265 ) .

Neuronal Diseases The endocytosis and exocytosis of neurotransmitters and their receptors are crucial for a large number of neuronal functions . Dynamin , endophilin , and PACSIN1 / Syndapin I are essentially involved in such processes , presumably through their functions in scission , subsequent uncoating of cargo , and / or recycling . PACSIN1 is crucially involved in the morphogenesis of neuronal cells in cooperation with N - WASP and dynamin ( 48 ) . Furthermore , PACSIN1 knockout mice suffer from seizures , a phenotype consistent with excessive hippocampal network activity ( 145 ) as well as defects in presynaptic membrane trafﬁcking processes . At the molecular level , it appears that PACSIN1 plays an important role in the recruitment of all dynamin isoforms and is a central player in vesicle - membrane ﬁssion reactions ( 145 , 216 ) . Thus PACSIN1 acts as a pivotal membrane - anchoring factor for the dynamins during regeneration of synaptic vesicles . Unlike PACSIN1 , triple knockout of all three mouse endo - philin proteins did not cause defects in endocytotic vesicle scission , but led to defects in the uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles , thereby reducing the dynamics of synapse transmission ( 182 ) . This defect is likely caused by the loss of the ability of endophilin to bind to and recruit synaptoja - nin , the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphatase that functions to uncoat these vesicles ( 207 , 249 ) . However , further studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms involved in this process ( 6 , 145 , 171 , 182 , 290 ) . Interestingly , CIP4 appears to function in the formation of neurite , although it is unclear how CIP4 functions in endo - cytosis or other processes in neurons . CIP4 - null neurons are speciﬁcally precocious in forming neurites ( stage 1 – 2 tran - sition ) , but not in polarization ( stage 2 – 3 transition ) , indi - cating that CIP4 expression inhibits neuritogenesis . If CIP4 is a negative regulator of neuritogenesis , then the CIP4 - null neurons would be expected to form longer neurites than those of the wild - type controls , and this is indeed the case . The CIP4 - null cortical neurons extend axons 1 . 5 times lon - ger than the controls at 1 day in vitro ( 236 ) . One additional link between CIP4 and neuronal health is through the hun - tingtin gene , which CIP4 can bind to , thus potentially af - fecting the symptoms and progression of Huntington’s dis - ease ( 113 ) . As described above , srGAPs which have Rho - GAP activities are important multifunctional adaptor proteins involved in various aspects of neuronal development , including axon guidance , neuronal migration , spine maturation , and syn - aptic plasticity . Therefore , the defects of srGAP genes are thought to link to some neurodevelopmental disorders , such as mental retardation , schizophrenia , and seizure . The srGAP3 protein , alternative name of mental - disorder asso - ciated GAP protein ( MEGAP ) , is reported to be disrupted and functionally inactivated by a translocation breakpoint in a patient who shares some characteristic clinical features , such as hypotonia and severe mental retardation , with the 3p (cid:2) syndrome ( caused by deletions affecting many genes at the terminal end of chromosome 3p ) ( 60 ) . Loss of srGAP3 was found to result in reduced density of spines and be linked to impaired learning and memory ( 29 ) . Its knockout mice lead to mismigration of postnatal neural progenitors and blockage of the cerebral aqueduct , inducing lethal hy - drocephalus ( 139 ) or schizophrenia - related behaviors ( 313 ) . On the other hand , srGAP2 is implicated in a severe neurodevelopmental syndrome causing early infantile epi - leptic encephalopathy ( 239 ) . Interestingly , there are human speciﬁc splicing isoforms of srGAP2 , which might be in - volved in human speciﬁc brain development ( 30 ) . Intriguingly , the role of PACSIN1 / Syndapin I also extends to cilia formation in the sensory hair cells of the inner ear in zebraﬁsh , where it is required for formation of both micro - tubule - dependent kinocilia and F - actin - rich stereocilia ( 247 ) . Furthermore , two less characterized F - BAR domain - containing proteins , FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 , are also re - ported to be involved in hair cell stereocilia function through regulation of actin polymerization ( 28 ) . VII . CONCLUSIONS AND OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS All cellular organelles have a membrane separating it from the rest of the cell , with the cell itself being surrounded by the PM . Although the development of the electron micro - scope has helped to reveal many of the micro - structures present on these membranes , these structures are often com - plex , difﬁcult to visualize , and short - lived . Thus we only have a fragmented understanding of how these membrane structures are generated . Many of these structures are thought to be generated through protein - lipid interactions , and numerous factors in the genome appear to encode pro - teins for such functions . Recently , noncoding RNAs have been shown to function in various aspects of membrane biochemistry / morphology , mainly through manipulation of transcription . However , RNA and other nucleic acids do have a strong negative charge , making it possible , albeit at high concentrations , for them to affect the interactions be - tween the anionic membrane lipids and the cationic residues of membrane deforming proteins . However , it is not clear whether RNA and other nucleic acids interact with mem - brane - deforming proteins . Although we have a basic understanding of the membrane - binding proteins at present , there are no genome - wide stud - ies identifying the whole list of proteins with lipid - binding abilities . Several attempts have been made to begin the membrane - binding domain screening process ( 138 ) ; how - ever , few membrane - binding gene families have been found to date . When we consider the total number of human pro - teins , then the total number of known membrane curvature - SHAPING OF CELLULAR MEMBRANES 1239 Physiol Rev (cid:129) VOL 94 (cid:129) OCTOBER 2014 (cid:129) www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 5 on A p r il 2 0 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m related proteins might be small in percentage . The occur - rence of the proteins containing an ALPS motif in the whole genome is totally 385 among the 14 , 049 human proteins analyzed , suggesting 2 . 7 % of the total number of human proteins according to the prediction program ( 55 ) . Further - more , the total number of BAR domain - containing proteins in the human genome , including BAR , F - BAR , and I - BAR , is (cid:3) 70 ( 238 ) , while the number of ENTH domain - contain - ing proteins is only 21 , according to the SMART database ( 248 ) . With such a low percentage of proteins being able to interact with the membrane , the functional loss of just one can lead to any number of cellular defects or diseases . How - ever , we know that the cluster of the basic - charged amino acid residues is sufﬁcient for membrane binding , and there are thought to be a lot of proteins with such amino acid sequence . Therefore , we can assume that we only know a part of the whole list of the membrane binding protein . Thus it is increasingly important to determine the possible membrane - binding ability of all of the proteins to under - stand how proteins are regulating membrane morphology in a particular organism , such as humans . Our ability to study membrane - protein interactions is en - tirely dependent on the methodology used to visualize this relationship . The structural determination of protein do - mains , combined with superresolution microscopy ( which enables resolution as high as 10 nm , corresponding to the size of a single protein ) , will likely revolutionize the ﬁeld , pushing our understanding of membrane structure forma - tion forward . With these techniques , we may eventually be able to map individual proteins , molecule by molecule , to determine their speciﬁc location in the cell . With the ability to identify protein localization in such nanoscale structures , we are conﬁdent that the next generation of cell biology inquiry will begin . These new techniques should be applied to study the assembly of BAR proteins and their binding proteins , as well as the localization of phosphoinositides . At present , we do not have a lot of examples of ordered assem - bly of proteins in vivo . The new techniques might unravel unexpected ordered assembly of the BAR proteins as we have already observed in in vitro reconstitution experi - ments . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS S . Suetsugu and T .
