Community Resilience : Quantifying the Disruptive Effects of Sudden Spikes in Activity within Online Communities Jackie Chan jackiec3 @ illinois . edu University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign Urbana , Illinois , USA Aditi Atreyasa aditiatreyasa @ u . northwestern . edu Northwestern University Evanston , Illinois , USA Stevie Chancellor steviec @ umn . edu University of Minnesota Minneapolis , Minnesota , USA Eshwar Chandrasekharan eshwar @ illinois . edu University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign Urbana , Illinois , USA ABSTRACT Online communities often experience some form of crisis . Regard - less of whether these communities are small groups or entire plat - forms , the ability to handle disruptions during volatile periods sig - nifies the resilience of a community . In this paper , we analyze the effects of a specific type of crisis event on Reddit : sudden spikes in attention received by a community due to a post from the subreddit hitting r / popular—the default feed that aggregates the most popular content on Reddit . Our results show that r / popular is a source of po - tential disruptions due to the higher number of comments , authors , and especially removed comments found compared to threads that do not reach r / popular . When looking at r / popular’s effects across subreddits , large communities’ commenting and posting behav - iors were less impacted by r / popular threads compared to smaller communities . However , similar - sized subreddits had substantial variations in how their commenting and posting activities were influenced by an r / popular thread . Understanding the causal factors behind these differences has implications for online governance , as well as fostering resilient and healthy communities .

Given the rising popularity of virtual spaces , it is especially important to under - stand what makes an online community successful as well as how to reach that level of success . When evaluating what makes a suc - cessful online community , the first things we often think about are metrics like growth and quality of content [ 24 ] . However , taking a deeper look into the literature we find other important , but more subjective features like the ability to integrate new users [ 16 , 17 ] and maintain communal norms [ 7 ] . Even though we know that these traits are valuable , communities of all sizes still experience crises : events that severely disrupt the activities of an online com - munity [ 16 , 21 ] . These crises can be the result of organized trolling campaigns [ 10 , 18 ] , prominent moderator interventions [ 6 , 21 ] , and sudden spikes in activity [ 16 ] . No matter the origin , the perva - siveness of crises across the web illustrates how crucial it is for a community to be able to withstand the impact of crises . In this paper , we examine multiple Reddit communities and their respective ability to withstand crises to develop a concept called community resilience . Based on prior work [ 3 , 8 , 20 ] , we define re - silience as the ability to reduce the impact of disruptions during crises . Understanding community resilience and the factors that influence it has practical implications for how platforms and moderators gov - ern their communities and provide stability for their users . Instead of relying solely on reactive approaches to combat disruptive and antisocial behavior after they occur , communities can adopt pre - ventative approaches to foster resilience in a proactive manner [ 14 ] . Moreover , the notion of community resilience serves as a natural extension to prior work on defining , identifying , and facilitating successful online communities [ 16 , 17 , 19 , 24 ] . For example , the lack of antisocial behavior does not necessarily indicate a thriving and successful community . Instead , a successful community might be characterised by its ability to withstand disruptive behavior , and bounce back in the face of adversity . To examine the resilience of communities , we look towards Red - dit and “crises” generated by appearing or “hitting” its default ( i . e . , popular ) feed called r / popular . Reddit is a forum - based social me - dia platform that hosts communities , called subreddits , that are often regulated by volunteer moderators . Based on a ranking algo - rithm that combines high - volume of upvotes and recency , Reddit CHI ’22 Extended Abstracts , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Chan , et al . compiles a dynamic collection of “popular” threads from across dif - ferent subreddits and these popular threads collectively appear on r / popular . Threads on r / popular—and subsequently the subreddits that generated these threads—are exposed to millions of new users browsing the popular feed . These new sets of eyes , often unfamiliar to the rules that govern the space , have the potential to discuss and contribute within these subreddits leading to disruptions if not properly integrated [ 16 , 17 ] . The popular feed will serve as the origin for crises that we analyze in this work because it can lead to substantial spikes in activity within subreddits . Examining how sub - reddits react to such spikes in activity will allow us to understand community - level differences in response and resilience when faced with disruptions . More specifically , we ask the following research questions about hitting r / popular and how it impacts subreddits : ( RQ1 ) What impact does hitting r / popular have on Reddit posts ? ( RQ2 ) How are different communities affected when their posts hit r / popular ? ( RQ3 ) What are causal factors that affect the intensity and longevity of r / popular’s impacts on communities ? We answer these questions by collecting posts ( referred to by threads here on ) and comments from subreddits that hit r / popular between February 23 , 2020 and July 30 , 2020 . Our final dataset com - prises of a total of 7 , 139 r / popular threads from 30 study subreddits with varying number of subscribers , along side hundreds of thou - sands of control threads ( i . e . , threads that did not hit r / popular ) and millions of comments generated within these communities . Using this dataset , we employ statistical methods , including Wilcoxon signed - rank tests using matched pairs ( Section 4 . 1 ) and linear mod - els ( specifically Poisson regressions in Section 4 . 2 ) to estimate the thread - level and community - level effects of hitting r / popular within the study subreddits . Through our analysis , we find that at a thread - level , threads that hit r / popular receive higher levels of activity , newcomer participation and comment removals ( Section 4 . 1 ) . At the community - level , we find spill - over effects caused by an individ - ual thread from a subreddit hitting r / popular , observing significant spikes in overall activity levels and newcomer influx within the subreddit . We find that not all communities are affected in the same way : the number of comments and threads from large subreddits are less impacted by individual r / popular threads when compared to small and medium subreddits . Likewise , similar - sized subreddits exhibit differential effects from r / popular threads ( Section 4 . 2 ) . Ex - amining the causal factors leading to such variations in intensity and longevity of impacts from sudden spikes in activity will allow us to understand what makes communities resilient to crises . Next , we review existing work , and then present our empirical investigation into answering RQ1 and RQ2 . Finally , we reflect on some of the opportunities introduced by findings from our empirical work so far ( e . g . , RQ3 ) , and conclude by discussing our plans to address these questions . 2 BACKGROUND To situate this work , we will highlight some relevant literature in three areas : ( 1 ) understanding what online community success means , ( 2 ) measuring crises in online communities , and ( 3 ) defining community resilience . Community Success . There has been extensive literature that discusses what makes successful online communities [ 9 , 17 , 24 ] . Kraut and Resnick [ 17 ] is a particularly seminal work in the area as it highlights numerous challenges that come with building suc - cessful online communities . This includes encouraging content contributions , membership commitment , and integrating newcom - ers . Despite their work , a significant portion of the literature in community success often focuses on growth metrics [ 11 , 15 , 16 , 26 ] . Cunha et al . [ 9 ] serves as a recent deviation from this paradigm as it highlights additional avenues for communities to be successful ; avenues that are distinct in that they are not highly correlated . Not only are there different success pathways , Weld et al . [ 24 ] found that community members and moderators differ in what they con - sider community improvements ( e . g . , community members valued democracy more than moderators ) . Additionally , there have been other articles that focus on attributes like membership overlap [ 26 ] , content quality [ 19 ] , and sense of community [ 16 ] . All of these examples illustrate the complexity of community success because it incorporates multiple different features and perspectives . Our work builds upon the community success literature by analyzing a community’s ability to withstand crises ( i . e . , community resilience ) . Community Crisis . All of this work in understanding commu - nity success is in part trying to reduce instability and antisocial behavior that communities experience , whether those communities are small groups [ 16 ] or entire platforms like Reddit [ 6 , 10 , 18 , 21 – 23 ] and Twitter [ 13 , 25 ] . These papers often analyze antisocial behavior through detection [ 4 ] and prevention through moderator interventions and tools [ 5 , 6 , 13 ] . In contrast to antisocial behavior , community health is often viewed in the negative sense of avoiding bad behavior in online communities [ 2 ] . However , we believe that focusing on developing prosocial measures and strategies have sub - stantial potential in curbing these negative behaviors . Bao et al . [ 1 ] also shares this interest in their work analyzing prosocial aspects of conversations online . With sufficient development , we believe that community resilience will also belong in the category of prosocial metrics . Community Resilience . A significant inspiration for our work comes from Butler et al . [ 3 ] where they defined community re - silience as the ability for community membership to be stable in spite of topical changes . Although important , we modify it to in - stead focus on crises which are often sudden , unexpected , and highly disruptive . This viewpoint matches the definition specified in Cohen et al . [ 8 ] , but there are a variety of other ways to interpret community resilience as it encompasses factors like community adaptability , agency , vulnerability , and so on . Those variations and distinctions are described thoroughly in Matarrita - Cascante et al . [ 20 ] . For the rest of this paper , we will only focus on crisis manage - ment when discussing community resilience . 3 DATA As mentioned earlier , we are interested in examining the impact of a community thread reaching r / popular 1 —the default feed that aggre - gates the most popular ( i . e . , the most highly voted ) content across subreddits . Similar to other subreddits , r / popular is a dynamic feed that updates over time to display the most voted - on and active 1 https : / / www . reddit . com / r / popular / Community Resilience : Quantifying the Disruptive Effects of Sudden Spikes in Activity within Online Communities CHI ’22 Extended Abstracts , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA content on the platform . The feed updates in real time and serves only as a content aggregator , thus no records exist for r / popular . As a result , the data needed to be collected in real time . To do this , we collected the top 100 r / popular threads every six hours from Febru - ary 23 , 2020 to July 30 , 2020 using the Python Reddit API Wrapper ( PRAW ) . 23 The resulting dataset contained 43 , 557 r / popular threads spanning across 883 subreddits . For tractability , the 883 subreddits observed were split into three equal - sized groups ( large , medium , and small subreddits ) based on the number of subscribers each com - munity had . For each group , we collected comments and threads from ten randomly - selected subreddits totaling to 30 study subred - dits . The subreddit comment and thread data were collected during the same date range as the r / popular dataset , in addition to a few months prior to the initial date ( i . e . , July 30 , 2019 to July 30 , 2020 ) using the Python Pushshift . io API Wrapper ( PSAW ) . 4 A summary of the dataset we analyzed is provided in Table 1 . 4 ANALYSIS & FINDINGS Here we will present the statistical methods , analysis , and interpre - tation for each research question , starting with the most fundamen - tal research question that establishes that the differences between r / popular threads and threads that do not reach r / popular . 4 . 1 Thread - Level Effects of Hitting r / popular ( RQ1 ) Wilcoxon Signed - Rank Test . To determine whether r / popular had effects on individual subreddits , we used a one - way Wilcoxon signed - rank test using matched pairs to test whether r / popular threads ( i . e . , treatment threads ) had ( 1 ) a greater number of com - ments , ( 2 ) a higher percentage of removed comments , and ( 3 ) a greater number of distinct authors compared to threads that did not make it to r / popular ( i . e . , control threads ) . We examined these three metrics because spikes in these measures are often disruptive if not handled properly [ 16 , 22 , 23 ] . Additionally , we used a Wilcoxon signed - rank test because we could not assume that these three met - rics fell on a normal distribution—hence a non - parametric test was used to be conservative . The small subreddits were omitted from this test due to insufficient r / popular threads , so further conclusions only apply to medium and large subreddits . Propensity Score Matching . To generate treatment - control pairs for the Wilcoxon signed - rank test , we used propensity score matching [ 12 ] to find control threads that were most similar to the treatment thread so that the comparisons were more valid than picking a random thread . The propensity score matching algorithm used the following covariates to pair treatment and control threads : ( 1 ) the Unix timestamp of when the thread was created ; ( 2 ) the domain of the link attached on the thread ; ( 3 ) whether the thread contains media hosted on Reddit ; ( 4 ) whether the thread contains a video ; ( 4 ) whether the thread contains content restricted to adults ( i . e . , over 18 ) ; ( 5 ) the length of the text contained in the thread ( 0 if no thread text ) ; and ( 6 ) the length of the title . These features were selected over others because they can be used to represent a thread’s 2 https : / / praw . readthedocs . io / en / stable / 3 During collection , there was a three - day down period from April 14 , 2020 to April 16 , 2020 . 4 https : / / psaw . readthedocs . io / en / latest / Subreddit # popular # comments # threads politics 896 12 , 520 , 845 197 , 384 pics 818 4 , 610 , 057 281 , 361 aww 748 3 , 008 , 561 462 , 008 funny 707 4 , 238 , 608 425 , 158 worldnews 666 6 , 059 , 124 225 , 099 todayilearned 660 2 , 795 , 024 71 , 573 nextfuckinglevel 615 2 , 062 , 885 45 , 186 interestingasfuck 610 2 , 421 , 460 63 , 198 news 603 5 , 160 , 540 363 , 689 gaming 596 3 , 418 , 176 303 , 337 ( a ) Large Subreddits Subreddit # popular # comments # threads suicidebywords 22 53 , 844 6 , 219 FunnyandSad 19 60 , 395 8 , 518 DesignPorn 19 52 , 977 3 , 461 thatHappened 19 180 , 547 16 , 288 witcher 19 230 , 560 18 , 839 Competitiveoverwatch 19 536 , 046 12 , 645 lgbt 19 475 , 919 57 , 293 community 18 162 , 293 18 , 098 cyberpunkgame 18 266 , 438 12 , 912 PraiseTheCameraMan 18 50 , 908 2 , 771 ( b ) Medium Subreddits Subreddit # popular # comments # threads tattoos 3 113 , 323 22 , 765 PersonalFinanceCanada 3 475 , 299 31 , 221 oddlyspecific 3 48 , 552 7 , 207 Instantregret 3 68 , 635 4 , 330 thisismylifenow 3 18 , 113 1 , 717 Baking 3 179 , 305 37 , 872 startrek 3 261 , 830 10 , 436 BattlefieldV 3 371 , 947 30 , 111 comicbooks 3 188 , 877 17 , 843 OldPhotosInRealLife 3 27 , 226 1 , 361 ( c ) Small Subreddits Table 1 : Number of popular threads , comments , and threads collected for each subreddit between February 23 , 2020 to July 30 , 2020 . characteristics at the time of posting and remain static ( i . e . , they do not change over time ) . From inspection , the algorithm heavily prioritized temporal proximity so the pairs were often posted within the same day or hour . An example of a matched pair can be found in Appendix A2 . Findings from Wilcoxon Signed - Rank Test . The Wilcoxon signed - rank tests showed that r / popular threads have a greater num - ber of comments and unique authors compared to threads from the same subreddit that did not reach r / popular . This result holds for all large and medium subreddits analyzed . The differences , expressed by the resulting coefficients , were especially drastic for the large subreddits compared to medium subreddits . That makes intuitive CHI ’22 Extended Abstracts , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Chan , et al . sense as the large subreddits often have threads reach higher levels of peak activity compared to medium subreddits . Regarding the rate of comment removals , all of the large subreddits’ r / popular threads had a higher percentage of removed comments compared to control threads , but there were non - statistically significant re - sults for some of the medium subreddits . A potential explanation could be that having smaller moderation teams leads to a lack of comment removals within medium subreddits . Although these tests conclude that r / popular threads and control threads are different in these measures , it does not tell us whether hitting r / popular was the cause for these differences . Nevertheless , these differences show that r / popular threads can be a source of disruption due to the high levels of activity generated . 4 . 2 Variations in Subreddit - Level Effects of Reaching r / popular ( RQ2 ) Poisson Regression Analysis . To estimate subreddit - level effects of hitting r / popular , we computed the daily number of r / popular threads within a subreddit and examined its relation to six com - munity metrics that were also computed daily : ( 1 ) the number of comments , ( 2 ) the number of unique comment authors , ( 3 ) the num - ber of new comment authors who have not posted before on the subreddit—we looked back as far as July 30 , 2019 , ( 4 ) the number of removed comments , ( 5 ) the number of threads , ( 6 ) the number of unique thread authors each day . Essentially , these six daily commu - nity metrics form a time series ( an example is shown in Appendix A1 ) that can be compared to the aggregate number of r / popular threads to estimate the relationship between daily aggregate num - ber of r / popular threads and the metrics described above . We used these six easy - to - interpret community metrics to explore the poten - tial impacts of hitting r / popular on communities . These metrics are not exhaustive , and future work should explore other , more com - plex community metrics—for example , daily toxicity levels provided by the Perspective API 5 and so on . With the generated community metrics , we ran pairwise tests with generalized linear models , specifically Poisson regressions given that our outcome variables of interest were raw counts . The Poisson regression analyses give us the ability to compute the percentage change an r / popular thread has on a subreddit’s daily number of comments as well as the other five metrics we calculated . Table 2 displays the results from our regression analyses . Findings from Regression Analyses . Results from our re - gression analysis demonstrates the spill - over effects of individual r / popular threads on overall activity within subreddits . Almost all study subreddits had significant , positive associations between hitting r / popular and community metrics like activity levels , new - comer influx , and comment removals . For instance , we found that an increase in the number of r / popular threads on a given day within all study subreddits—large , medium and small— resulted in a significant increase in the number of newcomers posting within the subreddit . With the exception of two medium and two small subreddits , we also observed that an increase in r / popular threads corresponds to an increase in the number of comment removals within the subreddits . In other words , hitting r / popular generates significant spikes in activity levels and newcomer participation 5 https : / / www . perspectiveapi . com / within subreddits , thereby having the potential leading to more comment removals and other undesirable behavior . Differences in Effects Across Subreddit Groups . We found that large subreddits are less impacted by a single r / popular thread compared to medium and small communities ( as observed through percent changes in metrics shown in Table 2 ) . One potential reason for this trend could be the sheer number of r / popular threads in these large subreddits making any one individual thread have minimal impacts on the overall community . Another explanation could be that such crises are commonplace within larger subreddits , thereby reducing the impact of individual r / popular threads . This indicates that increased exposure to crises in the past could play a role in a community’s resilience to the impacts of a new crisis . Differences in Effects Within Subreddit Groups . Despite not hav - ing massive percentage changes when compared to medium and small subreddits , large subreddits do exhibit variations in how they are affected by individual r / popular threads . When looking within the group of large subreddits , r / pics and r / news stand out from the rest , experiencing larger increases in activity levels upon hit - ting r / popular . The characteristics that led to these within - group differences have yet to be explored , but understanding these rea - sons could lead to recommendations for communities to handle the impacts of elevated levels of activity and new user influx . This is especially important because r / pics and r / news also exhibited a higher percentage of removed comments because of r / popular threads—indicating that there was an increase in the number of norm violations caused by threads hitting r / popular . Similar within - group differences are observed in the case of medium and small subreddits as well—for example , r / lgbt ( least increase in # comments ) and r / cyberpunkgame ( most increase in # comments ) compared to the rest of the subreddits in the group ( as shown in Table 2 ) . Another potential reason for communities exhibit varying levels of effects from hitting r / popular could be the nature of content and discussions ( e . g . , how accessible is the subreddit’s topic of discussion to newcomers ) . Let us consider the case of r / PersonalFinanceCanada which is a small subreddit , so we would expect r / popular to have a substantial impact on activity lev - els within the subreddit . However through our analysis , we found that is not really the case , specifically with regards to increase in number of comments ( 14 . 79 % ) and authors ( 11 . 41 % ) . The reason for these small spikes ( when compared to other small subreddits ) could be the expertise required to contribute within this commu - nity or perhaps the moderation team mandating ( and enforcing ) certain guidelines on comments posted within the subreddit , thus making r / PersonalFinanceCanada more resilient to sudden spikes in attention . Contextual Differences . However , some variations ( within and across subreddit groups ) may not necessarily be indicative of com - munity resilience , but rather contextual differences . For example , the variation between r / community and r / cyberpunkgame , both similar - sized communities , is drastic—r / community sees a 56 . 02 % in - crease in the number of comments compared to r / cyberpunkgame’s 152 % increase , when a post hits r / popular . The most likely rea - son for this difference is the following : the growth in activity on r / community ( a subreddit dedicated to a television show ) lasted throughout the show’s airtime whereas r / cyberpunkgame ( a sub - reddit dedicated to a video game ) rose rapidly with the release of Community Resilience : Quantifying the Disruptive Effects of Sudden Spikes in Activity within Online Communities CHI ’22 Extended Abstracts , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Table 2 : The pairwise Poisson regression results comparing daily r / popular threads for each subreddit to the community metrics described in Section 4 . 2 converted to percentage change . For example , each r / popular thread results in a 3 . 3 % increase in comments in r / politics . This table highlights the variations in r / popular thread impacts across different - sized communities and the overall trend is that larger subreddits are less affected by r / popular threads . Empty cells were not statistically significant ( α = 0 . 05 ) . Bonferroni corrections were applied .

This contrast can be seen in Appendix A3 . An example where context might not matter as much would be r / worldnews and r / news which share similar types of content , but r / news had 17 . 04 % increase in comments for each r / popular thread compared to r / worldnews with 3 . 48 % . The differences between r / worldnews and r / news extends to the other metrics as well ( excluding the non - significant association for number of threads on r / worldnews ) . Overall , we found that threads hitting r / popular had a less intense impact on r / worldnews when compared to r / news—indicating that r / worldnews might be more resilient than r / news based on the intensity of effects following a crisis . 4 . 3 Factors that Affect the Intensity and Longevity of Community - level Effects ( RQ3 ) As seen in Table 2 , there is a significant amount of variation in the disruptive , spillover effects of r / popular threads on subreddits , both within and across groups . Additionally , our previous regressions were unable to capture the variations between r / popular threads within the same subreddit . In other words , what causes certain r / popular threads to result in more drastic effects compared to others ? To investigate this question , we will examine differences between the community - level effects of r / popular threads through two lens : longevity and intensity . To do so , we will estimate the magnitude of the effects of r / popular threads on the community ( i . e . , intensity ) and how long these effects last ( i . e . , longevity ) . To illustrate , consider the example of newcomer influx ( or # new authors in Table 2 ) to a community as a result of threads hitting CHI ’22 Extended Abstracts , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Chan , et al . r / popular . We plan to estimate intensity by measuring the magni - tude of change in the number of newcomers brought into a commu - nity resulting from a given r / popular thread— # new authors posting within the popular thread . Next , we plan to estimate how long the newcomers brought into the community through the r / popular thread continue to post on other parts of the subreddit . Specifi - cally , at what time interval t after the r / popular thread “ends” ( i . e . , timestamp when the last comment was made within the popular thread ) , do the majority of newcomers stop participating within the community ? This example demonstrates how we plan to exam - ine the longevity and intensity of newcomer influx resulting from threads hitting r / popular . Using similar formulations , we will ex - amine a range of community - level effects beyond newcomer influx , including activity levels , norm violations , and removal rates . We plan to use statistical methods to explore correlations be - tween longevity and intensity of effects caused by r / popular threads and features of r / popular threads ( e . g . , content type , topic , and con - troversiality ) , authors ( e . g . , karma , account age , and posting history of the authors of r / popular threads ) , and subreddits ( e . g . , subscriber counts , average activity and removal rates , size of moderation team ) to answer RQ3 . These subreddit - , thread - , and author - level associations will shed light onto what characteristics impact the community - level effects of threads hitting r / popular , and thereby identify factors that contribute to community resilience in the face of sudden spikes in activity . 5 DISCUSSION To recall , our goal was to understand how communities handle crises—in the form of sudden spikes in external attention and activity—when threads hit r / popular . By examining variations in community - level impacts of such crises we presented a notion of community resilience , thus building upon prior definitions of suc - cessful online communities . In this paper , we performed exploratory analyses on the effects of hitting r / popular and established that r / popular threads received a higher number of comments , authors as well as a higher percentage of removed comments when com - pared to threads that do not reach r / popular . From a community perspective , r / popular threads impacted not only the number of comments and threads , but other features like new users and comment removals . When looking across different - sized communities , we found that large subreddits are impacted less by individual r / popular threads compared to smaller communi - ties . Despite this overall trend , there still exists some unexplained variations between similar - sized communities ( e . g . , r / news and r / worldnews ) that have the potential to be attributed to the re - silience of communities . The resilience exhibited by a community in the face of adversity ( measured in terms of longevity and in - tensity of effects ) could be the result of a range of factors like exposure to crises in the past , existence of community guidelines and moderators , topics of discussion , and so on . In future work , we plan to examine potential causal factors that influence a community’s resilience and ability to rebound from crisis events . We can start by examining the features highlighted by prior work discussing how an online community managed a surge of newcomers [ 16 ] , namely : a strong moderation team , a collective sense of community , and usage of moderation tools . Additional community - characteristics we plan to explore are the accessibility of content mentioned in Section 4 . 2 , how prevalent rules are ( i . e . , are the rules posted somewhere easy to find ) , reputation thresholds for contributors ( i . e . , requiring a certain amount of karma on Reddit to post within a subreddit ) , requiring user verification to participate ( e . g . , r / Conservative requires users to prove they are conservative before participating ) , and nature of subreddit content ( i . e . , does a community primarily share text , images , or other media ) . Under - standing these causal factors is our primary focus for the future as it has practical implications for governing online communities and their ability to withstand crises . We consider this paper to be the first - step towards developing a conceptual framework for com - munity resilience . Though limited and exploratory , evidence from our analyses demonstrates the promise in this line of research and its implications for broadening our understanding of resilient and successful online communities . 6 CONCLUSION In this paper , we examined thread - level and community - level ef - fects of threads hitting r / popular ( the default feed on Reddit ) in order to study how different communities handle sudden spikes in attention . We found that r / popular threads were disruptive due to the elevated number of comments , authors , and comment re - movals . Additionally , we observed trends relating subreddit size to the impacts of individual r / popular threads measured through six community - level metrics . There were also significant variations found between similar - sized subreddits and subreddits containing similar types of content . These variations present an opportunity for future work to explore causal factors influencing a commu - nity’s ability to withstand spikes in disruptive activity during crisis events—the concept we referred to as community resilience . Further investigation into these causal factors has practical implications for online governance and fostering resilient and healthy communities . We believe that resilience is another pillar in the success metrics for online communities , similar to how stability and ability to rebound from crises are desirable in offline communities .
