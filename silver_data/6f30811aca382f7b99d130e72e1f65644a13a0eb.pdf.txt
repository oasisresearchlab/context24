When binding to glycolipids , multivalent lectins can affect their distribution and alter membrane shapes . Neolectins have now been designed with controlled number and position of binding sites to decipher the role of multivalency on avidity to a glycosylated surface and on membrane dynamics of glyco - lipids . A monomeric hexavalent neolectin has been first engineered from a trimeric hexavalent bacterial lectin , From this neolectin template , 13 different neolectins with a valency ranging from 0 to 6 were designed , produced , and analyzed for their ability to bind fucose in solution , to attach to a glycosy - lated surface and to invaginate glycolipid - containing giant liposomes . Whereas the avidity only depends on the presence of at least two binding sites , the ability to bend and invaginate membranes critically depends on the distance between two adjacent binding sites . B y deciphering the glycocode , lectins play crucial roles in many biological or pathological processes . [ 1 ] Whereas indi - vidual lectin binding sites have rather low affinity for glycans , multivalency results in high avidity for carbohydrates pre - sented in several copies on glycoconjugates at the cell surface . [ 2 ] Moreover , multivalency also triggers the clustering of glycoproteins or glycolipids on cell surfaces . [ 3 ] Shiga and cholera toxin B - subunits as well as capsid lectins from SV40 and norovirus have been demonstrated to cluster glycosphin - golipids , resulting in negative membrane curvature and formation of membrane invaginations . [ 4 ] Multivalency of carbohydrates has been extensively studied , but not that of lectins , mainly because of the difficulty to control the number and location of binding sites in oligomeric proteins . An alternative approach is to use lectins presenting internal repeats such as b - propellers that are built on the cyclic repetition of 5 to 7 b - sheets . [ 5 ] The bacterial lectin , RSL from Ralstonia solanacearum , is an ancestor of this fold , as it consists of a tandem repeat of two b - sheets that trimerizes as a six - bladed b - propeller ( Fig - ure 1a , b ) . [ 6 ] The resulting hexavalent trimer has the capacity to invaginate lipid membranes containing fucosylated glyco - lipids . [ 7 ] Reducing the valency from six to three resulted in a trivalent lectin that lost the capacity to induce membrane invaginations in giant liposomes . [ 7 ] However , the influence of topology , that is , repartition of binding sites in space and the distance between them , has not been investigated . We therefore propose herein a novel approach for controlling valency . The “neolectin” concept consists in the Figure 1 . a ) Overall structure of wt - RSL complexed with a MeFuc dis - played as spheres ( PDB code : 2BT9 ) .

Engineering was performed at the genomic level by linking three divalent RSL monomers with a SSTVPGD peptide linker ( Figure 1c ) . Differences introduced in gene design insure that all sites can be individually mutated in order to inactivate them , and allowed thereafter to control the number and position of the active binding sites . First , the monomeric neolectin with six active binding sites ( referred to as neoRSL _ VI ) was designed and led to a 273 amino acids protein , with six blades and two engineered linkers ( Figure 1 ; Supporting Information , Fig - ure S1 and Table S1 ) . The resulting recombinant protein has the expected MW of 30 kDa and a denaturation temperature of 66 8 ( Table 1 ; Supporting Information , and Figure S2 ) that is stabilized in the presence of fucose ( T m 88 8 C ) , which is indicative of correct refolding with conserved ligand binding properties . NeoRSL _ VI was tested for its ability to bind to carbohy - drates in solution and to glycosylated surfaces . Using ITC , titrating neoRSL _ VI with the monosaccharide ligand a - methyl fucoside ( a MeFuc ) ( Figure 2b ; Supporting Informa - tion , Figure S3 and Table S2 ) confirmed that all six binding sites of the neolectin were active ( n = 5 . 6 ) . The affinity for a MeFuc was in the micromolar range ( K d = 1 . 04 m m ) , with no significant difference to wt - RSL ( K d = 1 . 23 m m ) . Surface plasmon resonance data were measured using a surface of polyacrylamide ( PAA ) - decorated with a - fucose residues ( Figure 2c ; Supporting Information , Figure S4 and Table S3 ) with different concentrations of lectins . Because of multi - valent attachment , the binding curves were analyzed as a function of concentration ( Supporting Information , Fig - ure S4 ) using a two sites model that separates the affinity value at each site ( K d _ aff ) and the bulk avidity for the surface ( K d _ av ) . [ 8 ] NeoRSL _ VI has single site affinity in the micro - molar range ( K d _ aff = 0 . 9 m m ) , which is in excellent agreement with ITC data above , and a strong avidity for the glycosylated surface in nanomolar range ( K d _ av = 5 n m ) . This 180 - fold increase between the affinity for a single fucose and the avidity for multivalent fucose surface is the result of the clustering effect and is in the same range than previously obtained for wt - RSL ( K d _ aff = 0 . 7 m m and K d _ av = 9 n m ) [ 7 ] confirming the integrity of neoRSL . NeoRSL _ VI has been cocrystallized with a MeFuc and the resulting crystal diffracted to 1 . 35 (cid:2) resolution ( Supporting Information , Table S4 ) . NeoRSL _ VI folded as the expected six - bladed b - propeller with six occupied fucose binding sites , indicating that the engineering approach has been successful ( Figure 3a ) . Electron density of one of the linker engineered between blades 4 and 5 could be clearly identified ( Figure 3b ) and it adopted roughly the same shape as the natural linker ( Supporting Information , Figure S5 ) . The second linker is more flexible , but superimposition demonstrates that the engineered linker connects two b - strands while maintaining the position they adopt in the wild - type protein . Using the differences in gene sequence introduced in the binding site , it was possible to mutate each of them independently . Taking into account the circular symmetry of the protein , 13 different architectures can be produced , Table 1 : Comparison of wild - type RSL and neoRSL _ VI .

Individual sites were inactivated by mutating the Arg residue previously demon - strated as crucial : [ 6 , 7 ] R17A , R62A , R108A , R153A , R199A , and R244A , for site 1 to 6 , respectively . Double to sextuple Arg to Ala mutants were also prepared to obtain the 13 neolectins ( Figure 2a ) . For nomenclature , NeoRSL _ II 24 is a divalent lectin with site 2 and 4 active , and site 1 , 3 , 5 and 6 inactivated by Arg to Ala mutation ( Supporting Information , Figure S2 ) . Denaturation temperature of neolectins varied from 66 8 C for neoRSL _ VI to 50 . 5 8 C for neoRSL _ II 24 , and stabilization by bound fucose ligand has been always observed . The stoichiometry of all purified neolectins was verified by ITC ( Figure 2 ; Supporting Information , Figure S3 ) . Affin - ity for a MeFuc in solution displayed limited variations , with K d values between 0 . 85 m m for neoRSL _ V 12456 and 4 . 67 m m for neoRSL _ II 14 ( Supporting Information , Table S2 ) . All neo - lectins with valency ranging from 1 to 6 maintained the same high affinity towards fucose in solution and no correlation could be observed as a function of the number or the location of the active binding sites . As expected , the neolectin with all sites inactivated by the Arg to Ala mutation , neoRSL _ 0 , does not bind fucose efficiently anymore . However , a weak residual binding activity ( K d = 4 m m ) was observed , at the limit of the detection method . Since residual affinity is 2000 weaker than the normal one , it does not interfere with the characterization of the other mutants . From SPR experiments ( Figure 2 ; Supporting Informa - tion , Figure S3 and Table S3 ) , the local affinity for fucose , K d _ aff , did not present significant variations as a function of valency with values ranging from 0 . 8 m m for neoRSL V 12456 to 4 m m for neoRSL _ II 14 , in excellent agreement with those determined by ITC ( Figure 2e ) . The avidity constant , K d _ av , displayed more significant variations , with an almost linear decrease from 5 n m to 30 n m when the valency is varied from 6 to 2 . Surprisingly , the variation was only rather limited . Only the monovalent receptor , that is , neoRSL _ I , displayed a sharp drop in binding with a micromolar affinity ( K d = 13 . 4 m m ) , corresponding to the loss of any avidity effect . Neolectins with controlled valency and topology were then assayed in a synthetic membranous environment in order to test their potential to induce membrane invaginations . For this , the fucosylated glycolipid DOPE - Lewis a ( DOPE - Le a ) was reconstituted in giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) with a typical diameter between 10 and 30 m m ( Supporting Information , Figure S6 ) . As demonstrated previously , wt - RSL bound to Lewis a epitope ( 100 % ) on GUV surface and induced membrane invaginations in 93 % of the cases ( n = 280 ) . [ 7 ] NeoRSL _ VI displayed the same properties with formation of invaginations in 90 % of liposomes ( n = 100 ) ( Figure 4 ; Supporting Information , Figure S6 ) . When the valency is decreased to 5 or 4 ( Supporting Information , Figure S6 and Table S5 ) , the neolectins still bound efficiently to Le a epitope and induced invaginations . For trivalent RSL , different results were observed . NeoRSL _ III 246 only induced invaginations in 1 % of studied liposomes , as previously observed with trivalent RSL mutant R17A . [ 7 ] However , other trivalent neolectins such as neoRSL _ III 234 and neoRSL _ III 124 with at least two neighboring binding sites were still able to induce invaginations in 88 % and 70 % of liposomes , respec - tively . The topology of binding sites therefore appears to have a crucial effect on glycolipid clustering and dynamics within membranes . Analyzing divalent neolectins with two binding sites confirmed this observation ( Figure 4 ) . Among the three possible topologies , only neoRSL _ II 23 was able to induce membrane invaginations ( 80 % ) whereas neoRSL _ II 24 ( 4 % ) and neoRSL _ II 14 ( 0 % ) were not at all efficient . To sum up , all Alexa488 - labeled neolectins bound efficiently to GUVs , with the exception of neoRSL _ 0 , which has only residual affinity for fucose , but only the ones that present adjacent binding sites were able to induce invaginations . The process by which membrane glycosphingolipids trigger the internalization of bacterial and plant toxins and viruses through glycan binding has been the subject of few studies . Several pathways have been described and relevant biological functions were proposed to relate to cell internal - ization through vesicles formation . [ 9 ] The origin of the energy required for this physical process is not clear but has been proposed to arise from line tension generated by the Figure 3 . a ) Overall structure of the neoRSL VI complexed with a MeFuc displayed as spheres .

[ 10 ] In the present study such mechanisms would imply that upon DOPE - Le a binding , the neolectins cluster on the membrane surface , triggering the formation of lipid domains . This would be in agreement with the patches observed on liposomes when lectin binds . We demonstrated herein that hexavalent to trivalent and even divalent lectins are able to cluster glycolipids and alter membrane shape , providing that the binding sites are close enough ( Figure 5 ) . The hypothesis that close proximity of carbohydrate binding sites is a prerequisite for membrane curvature by bringing lipids close to each other is in agree - ment with the topologies of RSL ( distance of 15 (cid:2) ) . However the minimum distance for bending membrane may differ with the shape and curvature of the binding protein , as exemplified with viral capsids . [ 4a , d ] Our work has demonstrated that the capacity of multi - valent lectins to induce membrane invagination is not directly correlated with avidity to the glycosylated surface . This may shed light on the evolution of these proteins , resulting from oligomerization or duplication as tandem repeat . [ 11 ] Finally , these considerations would be of high importance for engineering cargo proteins designed for importing drugs through the binding to glycosphingolipids , as already pio - neered for Shiga toxins .
