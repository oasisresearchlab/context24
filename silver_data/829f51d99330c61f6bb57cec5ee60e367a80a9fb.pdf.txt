Germany 3Centre de Recherches Paris Saint - Antoine , 184 , rue du Faubourg Saint - Antoine , 75571 Paris Cedex 12 , France Received 9 August 1995 , revised 15 November 1995 Using immunochemical and immunohistochemical methods , the binding site of Anguilla anguilla agglutinin ( AAA ) was characterized and compared with the related fucose - specific lectin from Ulex europaeus ( UEA - I ) . In solid - phase enzyme - linked immunoassays , the two lectins recognized Fuccd - 2Gall3 - HSA . AAA additionally cross - reacted with neoglycolipids bearing lacto - N - fucopentaose ( LNFP ) I [ H type 1 ] and lI [ Le a ] and lactodifucotetraose ( LDFT ) as glycan moieties . UEA - I , on the other hand , bound to a LDFT - derived neoglycolipid but not to the other neoglycolipids tested . Binding of AAA to gastric mucin was competitively neutralized by Lea - specific monoclonal antibodies . UEA - I binding , on the other hand , was reduced after co - incubation with H type 2 - and LeY - specific monoclonal antibodies . According to our results , AAA reacts with fucosylated type 1 chain antigens , whereas UEA - I binds only to the cd - 2 - fucosylated LDFT - derived neoglycolipid . In immunohistochemical studies , the reactivity of AAA and UEA - I in normal pyloric mucosa from individuals with known Lewis and secretor status was analysed . AAA showed a broad reaction in the superficial pyloric mucosa from secretors and non - secretors , but AAA reactivity was more pronounced in Le ( a + b - ) individuals . On the other hand , UEA - I stained the superficial pyloric mucosa only from secretor individuals . A staining of deep mucous glands by the lectins was found in all specimens . Both reacted with most human carcinomas of different origin . Slight differences in their binding pattern were observed and may be explained by the different fine - specificities of the lectins . Keywords : lectin , Anguilla anguilla agglutinin , carbohydrate antigen , mmour - associated antigen Introduction Various ' fucose - specific ' lectins derived from different sources are important reagents in glycobiology , histo - and cytochemistry [ 1 - 3 ] . In 1952 , Watkins and Morgan demonstrated [ 4 ] that the agglutination of blood group O and A2 erythrocytes exerted by a substance derived from the serum of Anguilla anguilla can be inhibited by a - methyl - L - fucopyranoside and L - fucose . Contrasting this finding , other monosaccharides , especially D - and L - glucose , D - and L - galactose and N - acetyl - D - galactosa - * To whom correspondence should be adressed . 0282 - 0080 © 1996 Chapman & Hall mine failed to inhibit this reaction . Further studies regarding its binding to fucose and corresponding derivatives followed [ 5 - 7 ] . An additional capacity to detect terminal L - galactose residues could be shown by the use of various galactan polysaccharides [ 8 ] . However , a further characterization of its fine specificity , i . e . affinity towards al - 2fucosylated type 1 or type 2 back - bones and related Lewis antigens was not performed . On the other hand , related ' fucose - specific ' lectins like Ulex europaeus agglutinin I ( UEA - I ) [ 9 - 12 ] and Lotus tetra - gonolobus agglutinin ( LTA ) [ 13 , 14 ] were extensively characterized by immunochemical methods . According to these studies , UEA - I preferentially binds to Fucal - 586 Baldus et al . 2Gal / 31 - 4GlcNAc ( H type 2 blood group antigen ) with a cross - reactivity to Fuco ~ l - 2Gal / 31 - 4 ( Fuco ~ l - 3 ) GlcNAc / 3 ( Lewis y antigen ) , but not to internal c ~ - L - fucose units . LTA , on the other hand , is most strongly inhibited by Fuco ~ l - 6GlcNAc , followed by Fucc ~ l - 2Gal / B1 - 4 ( Fuco ~ l - 3 ) GlcNAc / 3 . We recently observed striking differences in the cyto - and histochemical reaction to human megakaryo - cytes exerted by UEA - I on the one side and AAA and LTA on the other hand [ 15 ] . Similar discrepancies were also reported by Ito et al . in their study [ 16 ] on lectin binding to ABH antigens in other human tissues . There - fore , the purpose of this study was : ( 1 ) to characterize the binding specificity of AAA by immunochemical analysis in comparison to the well - investigated lectin UEA - I ; and ( 2 ) to evaluate their immunohistochemical staining pattern in gastric tissues defined by secretor and Lewis status as well as carcinomas originating from various organs . Materials and methods MATERIALS Biotinylated Anguilla anguilla agglutinin ( AAA ) as well as biotinylated and unlabelled Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 ( UEA - I ) were purchased from E - Y Laboratories ( San Mateo , California , USA ) . Monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) 12 - 4LE [ 17 ] , 19 - 0LE ( cross - reacting between H type 2 and Le y ) [ 18 , 19 ] , 7 - LE ( anti - Le a ) [ 19 ] and 121 - SLE ( anti - sialosyl - Le a ) were generated in the laboratory of J . Bara . Their specificities were extensively studied previously [ 20 ] . Mab Bw494 detecting a terminal Gal / 31 - 3HexNAc unit and cross - reacting between Le a and T / 3 antigen [ 21 ] was a kind gift from Behringwerke ( Marburg , Germany ) . Monoclonal antibody LeuM1 ( anti - Le x ) was from Becton - Dickinson ( Heidelberg , Germany ) . Fucc ~ I - 2Gal / 31 - 0 ( CONH ) 30 - HSA was a kind gift from Dr Kolar ( Behringwerke , Marburg , Germany ) . The following oligo - saccharides derived from human milk were purchased from Oxford Glycosystems ( Abingdon , Oxon , United Kingdom ) : 1 . Fucod - 2Gall31 - 3GlcNAc / 31 - 3Gal ] 31 - 4Glc ( LNFP I ) [ H type 1 ] , 2 . GallB1 - 3 ( Fucod - 4 ) GlcNAcl31 - 3GatlB1 - 4Glc ( LNFP II ) [ Lea ] , 3 .

Gastric juice was collected and pooled according to the secretor and Lewis phenotype of the donors . Mucus glycoproteins were isolated following previously published procedures [ 22 ] by extraction with 90 % phenol . Preparation of neoglycolipids Neoglycolipids of LNFP I , LNFP II , LNFP III , LNDFH I and LDFT were prepared according to Stoll et al . [ 23 ] by coupling to dipalmitoylglycerophosphoethanolamine via reductive amination . Immunochemical analysis Antigens diluted in 0 . 1M carbonate buffer , pH 9 . 6 ( glycoproteins ) or in 40 % aqueous methanol ( neoglycoli - pids ) were coated to 96 - well polystyrene microtitre plates ( Nunc , Wiesbaden , Germany ) at 37 °C overnight . After blocking of unspecific binding sites with PBS ( 20 mM phosphate , 0 . 15 M NaC1 , pH 7 . 2 ) containing 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA , Sigma , Munich , Germany ) for 1 h at 37 °C , biotinylated lectins were incubated for 2 h at room temperature . All washing steps and lectin dilutions ( to 10 / xgm1 - 1 ) were performed with PBS / 0 . 5 % BSA . Streptavidin - alkaline - phosphatase conjugate , diluted 1 : 5000 , was incubated for 30rain at room temperature . The reaction was developed with p - nitrophenylphosphate ( 1 mgm1 - 1 ) in 50ram diethanolamine buffer pH 9 . 8 containing 0 . 5 mM MgC12 ( 30 min , 22 °C ) . Competition assays with mabs 12 - 4LE , 19 - 0LE , 7 - LE , 121 - LE , Bw494 and LeuM1 and untabelled UEA - I were carried out on gastric mucins pooled from Le ( a ~ b - ) individuals ( 25 / xgm1 - 1 ) with AAA and UEA - I in a dilution of 10 / xgm1 - 1 Mabs were used as undiluted cell culture supernatants ( 12 - 4LE , 19 - 0LE , 7 - LE , 121 - SLE ) , at 50 / , gm1 - 1 ( Bw494 ) or 1 : 10 ( by vol ) ( LeuM1 ) , respectively . Non - biotinylated UEA - I was employed at 50 / xgm1 - 1 . AAA and mabs were co - incubated for 1 h at 37 °C . Immunohistochemical labelling Human carcinoma tissues were derived from the files of the Institute of Pathology at the University of Cologne . Normal pyloric tissues were obtained from kidney donors with proven brain death and provided from the Centre de Recherches Paris Saint - Antoine . These specimens were fixed with 95 % ethanol and defined with regard to their secretor and Lewis status [ 20 ] . Human tissues were fixed in 5 % neutral - phosphate buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin . Five / zm thick sections were cut and deparaffinized following staladard histological techniques . After blocking of endogenous peroxidase using 1 % H202 in methanol for 30min , slides were incubated with biotin , elated lectins ( 100 / xg per ml TBS per 2 . 5 % BSA ) for 1 h . Specimens were incubated with streptavidin - peroxidase complex P396 ( Dakopatts , Copenhagen , Den - mark , diluted 1 : 400 in TBS per 2 . 5 % BSA ) for 1 h . Between all steps , which were performed at room temperature , the slides were threefold washed in TBS . The reaction was developed by 200 / xgm1 - 1 ( w / v ) 3 - amino - 9 - ethyl - carbazole ( Sigma , Munich , Germany ) in Characterization of AAA binding site 0 . 05 M sodium acetate buffer containing 5 % dimethylfor - mamide and 0 . 01 % 1 - { 202 for 30 min at room temperature . After counterstaining with Hematoxylin ( 5 rain ) , the slides were mounted in glycerol jelly . Binding specificity of AAA and UEA - I was controlled by co - incubation with 100 mM oz - L - fucose . Results and discussion lmmunochemical characterization In direct binding studies , AAA and UEA - I strongly bound to Fucod - 2Gal / 3 - HSA ( Fig . 1 ) . Binding of AAA and UEA - I to various neoglycolipids derived from milk oligosac - charides showed marked differences in the corresponding patterns of these lectins : AAA detected LNFP I ( bearing H type 1 antigen ) , more weakly also LNFP II , i . e . Le a antigen , but did not react with LNFP III or LNT ( Fig . 2a ) . Such a binding pattern implies a reactivity with particular type 1 oligosaccharide structures . The od - 2 - fucosylated LDFT , which is structurally modified by reductive amination , was bound by AAA and UEA - I . All other neoglycolipids failed to display a significant reactivity with the latter lectin ( Fig . 2b ) . This finding corresponds to the observation that UEA - I exerts a strong reactivity only with H type 2 and Le y antigen [ 10 - 12 , 19 ] , but not with type 1 oligosaccharides . Our results suggest the conclu - sion that AAA differs from UEA - I by a strong binding to H type 1 as well as Le ~ . Binding to gastric mucins from Le ( a + b - ) and Le ( a - b + ) individuals revealed further characteristic differences : AAA showed the same strength of reactivity towards both , whereas UEA - I exhibited a clear preference for the Le ( a - b + ) - derived mucin , i . e . od - 2 - fucosylated glycoprotein ( Fig . 3a , b ) . When the competitory activity of mabs and UEA - I towards AAA and UEA - I binding to gastric mucin from Le ( ~ + b - ) individuals was tested , AAA reactivity was markedly reduced by LeLspecific mabs 7 - LE [ 19 ] and BW494 [ 22 ] ( Table 1 ) . UEA - I binding , on the other hand , was strongly inhibited competitively by UEA - I and mabs 550 500 g 450 400 a 350 O 300 250 ~ J , i . . . . 110 i i i 2 3 5 20 30 50 Antigen concentration ( gg / ml ) AAA UEA - I O Figure 1 .

All the other mabs tested exerted only minimal competitive effects . Our immunochemical investigation reveals that AAA binds to particular type 1 antigens ( H type 1 , Le a ) in direct binding assays . A significant competitive effect on lectin binding to gastric mucins is only exerted by Le a - specific mabs . Opposed to this finding , like UEA - I , as has been described in previous reports [ 11 ] and in this study , neither LTA nor Galactia tenuiflora agglutinin [ 19 ] showed any binding to Le a . The latter differs from UEA - I since it has a certain affinity to H type I , but does not bind difucosylated structalres [ 19 , 24 , 25 ] . UEA - I and LTA , on the other hand , did not exert a relevant reactivity with H type 1 antigen [ 11 , 19 ] . Such differ - ences may be interpreted by the dependence of lectin binding to antigenic determinants from certain chemical conformations [ 26 ] . In conclusion , AAA has a carbo - hydrate binding specificity which is distinct from other ' fucose - specific ' lectins . Immunohistochemical studies Immunohistochemical characterization of AAA and UEA - I was performed on malignant and benign epithelial tissues from different organ sites . The reactivity of normal pyloric mucosa with known secretor and Lewis status was tested ( Table 2 ) . Briefly , AAA stained the surface epithelium in all specimens under study ( Fig . 4a ) . However , the binding was more intense in those derived from Le ( a + b - ) individuals . On the other hand , binding of UEA - I towards surface epithelium was only seen in specimens derived from individuals expressing the secretor gene ( Le ( a - b + ) ) . Pyloric mucous glands were stained by AAA and UEA - I without correlation to the secretor or Lewis properties ( Fig . 4b ) . These observations fit in well with the results of Mollicone et al . [ 27 , 28 ] , who established that biosynthesis of ozl - 2 - fucosylated antigens in the surface epithelium can only be observed in secretors , whereas such antigens are expressed in pyloric mucous glands independent from secretor status .

Carcinomas of the stomach , colorectum , pancreas , lung and mammary gland were tested to obtain data on the possible alterations of lectin binding sites in malignant tissues . AAA and UEA - I reacted with the vast majority of these carcinomas . The results are summarized in Table 3 . Membraneous as well as cytoplasmic and secretion - bound staining was observed ( Fig . 4c - e ) . Comparison of the binding patterns in the individual carcinomas revealed differences between the two lectins . As could be expected when taking into account the immunochemical analysis , UEA - I binding was more distinct compared to AAA binding . It had to be expected that most carcinomas are reactive with fucose - specific lectins , since the expression of ABH and Lewis antigens is a typical event in carcinogenesis [ 29 - 31 ] . However , immunochemical analy - sis as well as immunohistochemical demonstration of carbohydrate antigens in situ depend on the exact knowledge of the fine specificities of the lectins or monoclonal antibodies used .
