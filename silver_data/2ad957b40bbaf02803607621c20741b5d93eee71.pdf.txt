Fundamental limits of cellular morphodynamics such as how fast or how much cellular shapes can change without harm to a living cell remain poorly understood . Here we describe hyper - extensibility in the single - celled protist Lacrymaria olor , a 40 µ m cell which is capable of reversible and repeatable extensions ( neck - like protrusions ) up to 1500 µ m in 30 seconds . We discover that a unique and intricate organization of cortical cytoskeleton and membrane enables these hyper - extensions that can be described as the first cellular scale curved crease origami . Furthermore , we show how these topological singularities including d - cones and twisted domain walls provide a geometrical control mechanism for the deployment of membrane and microtubule sheets as they repeatably spool thousands of time from the cell body . We lastly build physical origami models to understand how these topological singularities provide a mechanism for the cell to control the hyper - extensile deployable structure . This new geometrical motif where a cell employs curved crease origami to perform a physiological function has wide ranging implications in understanding cellular morphodynamics and direct applications in deployable micro - robotics . Keywords : Active filaments , Protists , Cell - behavior , Biophysics , Non - linear dynamics , curved crease origami Significance statement Here we present the discovery of curved crease origami at the scale of a single cell . We show how topological singularities in the origami ( d - cones ) and twist walls in microtubule ribbons control deployment of a hyper - extensile neck in a single - celled protist . Our work establishes a direct link between geometry and cell behavior , connecting form and function of cellular morphodynamics . 2 1 Introduction 1 Unicellular protists are mesmerizing to observe as they perform dramatic morphological 2 changes in real time . Large physical transformations in cell architecture have been well - 3 studied during division [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , or in motility , such as when cells crawl through narrow 4 pores [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] . Many dynamic behaviors of cells within multi - cellular systems can also be 5 attributed to dramatic contractile and extensile properties , such as that of cardiac fibroblasts 6 in the heart [ 7 ] , peristalsis in the gut [ 8 ] , or the extreme stretchability without rupture of the 7 lung epithelium [ 9 ] . Individual cells must undergo large strains and strain rates to accomplish 8 these behaviors [ 10 ] . 9 What sets the fundamental limits of cellular morphodynamics remains unknown . Here 10 we use hyper - extension in a predatory ciliate Lacrymaria olor [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ] to establish 11 a system to study the limits of morphodynamics in single cells . To the amusement of an 12 observer , a small 40 µ m single cell is capable of extending a neck - like protrusion up to 1500 13 µ m in less than 30 seconds , then retracting this neck as quickly as it was extended [ 16 , 17 , 18 , 14 19 , 20 , 21 ] . Our previous work established the role of these extensions in comprehensively 15 searching its surroundings for prey [ 15 , 22 ] . As opposed to passive cellular deformations 16 [ 23 , 24 ] , L . olor actively extends and retracts its neck - like protrusion [ 15 , 22 ] via ciliary 17 dynamics . It is a remarkable feat of large scale deformations of a single cell that L . olor 18 repeats more than 20 , 000 times in its lifetime without failure . While cells can have many 19 different types of subcellular protrusions such as cilia , flagella , microvilli , axons , and more 20 [ 25 ] , the reversible , rapid , hyper - extensible protrusion of L . olor is unique , and the underlying 21 mechanisms which produce the cell’s extreme morphing behavior remain unknown . Previous 22 attempts to explain shape change in protists explored the role of shear amongst filaments 23 to modulate Gaussian curvature [ 26 , 27 ] . Although relevant to Euglena , an extension of 30 24 times the body length , as we report here in L . olor , is not feasible via pure shear alone . 25 Our current work aims to link form and function in a dynamic shape - shifting protist 26 highlighting the role of geometry in programming unicellular behavior [ 28 ] . Piecing together 27 3 data from multiple imaging modalities including real - time imaging and TEM ultra - structure 28 characterization , we discover a novel “curved crease origami” architecture within ultra long 29 helical microtubule ribbons that support hyper - extensibility . We demonstrate using scaled - 30 up physical models that this unique origami architecture of the cell directly enables ultra - long 31 reversible strains and large strain rates via geometrical transformations driven by ciliary ac - 32 tivity . Curved crease origami further creates a readily - deployable mechanism by controlling a 33 sharp transition in cell geometry between folded and unfolded zones using well known d - cone 34 and twisted domain wall singularities . This deeper understanding of how cortical cytoskele - 35 ton enables transformable material properties has the potential to expand our capacity to 36 build micro - scale living machines and deployable structures [ 25 ] . 37 2 Results 38 2 . 1 Comparative Single Cell Extensibility 39 Long thin protrusions are a common motif in biological cells . The largest strains recorded 40 at the cellular level often occur in thin extensile protrusions [ 25 ] . For example , spinal motor 41 neuron axons can grow up to 1 m in humans , compared to their cell body size of 10 µ m 42 [ 29 , 30 ] . Similarly , the highest strain rate recorded in a single cell also occurs in an extensile 43 protrusion in ultra - fast discharges of nematocysts that occur at speeds up to 18 . 6 m / s [ 31 ] . 44 We compiled published data on a variety of extensile protrusion dynamics in single cells 45 ( Fig . 1 , Supplementary Table 1 ) to observe the diversity of strain and extension rates 46 across the eukaryotic tree of life . At one extreme are ultra - fast single - shot extensions such 47 as in Microsporidia which use eversion of tube geometry to enable fast extrusion of tube - 48 like structures [ 32 , 33 , 34 ] . Conversely , several cell types such as neuronal cells are able to 49 extend to great lengths but only on longer developmental timescales [ 35 ] . Additionally , most 50 cellular protrusions are often irreversible [ 25 ] . One cell that stands out with both reversible 51 and fast extensile protrusions is Vorticella , a single cell filter feeder with a long contractile 52 4 stalk [ 36 , 37 ] . Though fast , the reversibility is still limited since extension is orders of 53 magnitude slower than contraction . Additionally , the total extension length is significantly 54 limited compared to other types of extensile protrusions [ 36 ] . Comparing this data set to 55 both wild type and lab cultures of the ciliate L . olor , we find rapid reversible “neck - like” 56 protrusions that can reach lengths 30 times the size of the cell ( 40 µ m ) at extension and 57 contraction speeds of 1000 µ m / s . This is a remarkable reversible extension of a single cell and 58 immediately raises many questions about how a cell can generate that much membrane and 59 cortical cytoskeleton to support such a large extension . Our current work directly addresses 60 this question . 61 2 . 2 Hyper - extensibility in a single cell 62 Lacrymaria olor is a unicellular ciliate in the family Lacrymariidae . This predatory ciliate 63 presents a unique morphology with a bulbous body often attached to substrates and an active 64 neck - like protrusion that searches for prey . As the neck extends and retracts , cytoplasm 65 containing small granules can be seen rushing in and out of the neck while a majority of 66 the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus remain anchored in the main cell body [ 15 ] . The body 67 and neck are uniformly covered with cilia which enable motility and neck length dynamics 68 [ 22 , 15 ] . Additionally , the oral apparatus at the anterior “head” contains specialized longer 69 cilia which collectively beat or pause regularly . In case of encounter with prey , the neck 70 behavior changes dramatically leading to remodelling of the neck [ 38 , 39 ] . Formation of a 71 food cavity in the neck once prey is captured leads to a bulge which is supported by the 72 cortical cytoskeleton as the prey is reeled in towards the cell body [ 38 , 39 , 15 ] . 73 Previously , we reported on analysis of neck extension / contraction dynamics in lab cul - 74 tures [ 15 ] . Surprisingly , wild collected cells show hyper - extension on a regular basis . During 75 the search for prey , the neck - like protrusion in wild - type cells demonstrates hyper - extension 76 [ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ] ) . For example , a single cell is capable of an extension reaching 1210 77 µ m in under 7 seconds while maintaining a constant cell body size of 40 µ m ( Fig . 1 , Fig . 78 5 2A - C , [ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ] ) . L . olor can then fully retract this protrusion as quickly as 79 extended and re - extend immediately ( Fig . 2A - C , [ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ] ) . We have recently 80 linked these extension / contraction dynamics directly to the search cloud observed in L . olor 81 [ 22 ] . After a burst of extension / contraction activity , the cell neck fully retracts and the cell 82 becomes “dormant” for a few minutes , remaining in this state until its next hunting event 83 [ 15 ] . 84 Tracking cell shape as a function of time ( Fig . 2A - C , [ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ] ) reveals fast 85 extension dynamics ( 1200 microns in 7 seconds ) with almost equally fast retraction speeds 86 ( Fig . 2D - F ) . Such a fast , reversible extension has never been reported for any other living 87 material , let alone a single cell . This raises the question of how a single cell can achieve such 88 extension and retraction rates . 89 2 . 3 Cortical cytoskeleton as a base for non - affine cellular exten - 90 sions 91 To understand the mechanics underlying this ultra - fast extension and contraction , we utilized 92 high speed DIC imaging to directly observe the neck extension process in live organisms 93 ( Phantom v1210 , 200fps , see methods for details ) ( Fig . 2H , Supplementary Movie 1 ) . When 94 undergoing the transition from a dormant state to an active hunting state , the cell elongates 95 to its longest neck lengths through a piece - wise process with pauses coinciding with ciliary 96 reversals ( Fig . 2G , H , Supplementary Movie 1 ) . The cell’s initial extension from dormancy 97 is a slow extension into a transition state , where the neck is only partially elongated ( Fig . 98 2G ) . Once in this state , the neck can then elongate rapidly , and the cell can easily traverse 99 morphologically between an active contracted state and an active elongated state . It is 100 important to note that although a dramatic extension of the cell has occurred during this 101 transition , much of the main cell body is hardly transformed . Thus this neck extension is not 102 a classical Hookean extension , but instead a non - affine extension where the neck elongates 103 without any extension observed in the cell body . 104 6 Since ciliates are defined classically by their cortical cytoskeleton structures which also 105 provide a map for surface cilia [ 40 ] , we next mapped the cortical cytoskeleton structure of L . 106 olor . During these extensions captured using high speed DIC imaging , the underlying cortical 107 cytoskeleton is also visible ( Fig . 2H ) . The neck and cell body of L . olor are structurally 108 supported by a cortical cytoskeleton primarily consisting of microtubule bundles ( Fig . 2I ) 109 and centrin ( Fig . 3H ) [ 14 , 15 ] . Microtubule filaments in an extended cell weave a left handed 110 helical structure , forming continuous bands from the tail of the cell body to the apical tip of 111 the neck ( Fig . 2I , 3A ) . The presence of filaments even in long necks and their continuation 112 into the body of the cell provides the first hint that the cortical cytoskeleton might play a 113 role in enabling long neck extensions . 114 Next we label cortical cytoskeleton of a broader range of ciliates with similar shape as L . 115 olor . We find that other single - celled ciliates with similar cellular morphologies have dramat - 116 ically different cortical cytoskeleton architectures and dramatically different cell behaviors . 117 Dileptus , for example , has a tear - drop shaped cell body and a neck - like protrusion which 118 the cell is not able to elongate or contract . The cortical cytoskeleton primarily consisting of 119 microtubule filaments is aligned along the long axis of the cell ( Fig . S1 ) . Tracheloraphis , on 120 the other hand , does not have a neck - like protrusion , but does exhibit whole cell contrac - 121 tion and elongation . This cell similarly has a cortical cytoskeleton composed of microtubule 122 filaments which again align with the long axis of the cell ( Fig . S1 ) . The different architec - 123 tures and behaviors in morphologically similar cells further supports our initial hypothesis 124 that the cortical cytoskeleton architecture in L . olor plays a role in the rapid , reversible 125 hyper - extension observed . 126 We next search for what allows microtubule filaments to be present in the extended neck 127 of L . olor . Although microtubule filaments are known to undergo dynamic instability , the 128 growth and catastrophe rates ( 10 µ m / min ) of those microtubule polymerization processes are 129 too slow to account for the 1000 µ m / s neck elongation in L . olor [ 41 , 15 ] . If not polymerized 130 and depolymerized during rapid extension and contraction cycles , pre - existant microtubule 131 7 filaments must be deployed and recovered for extension events . For an extension similar 132 to the one in Figure 2A , this would require storage up to 1400 µ m of microtubule filaments 133 within the cell . To understand the upper bounds of this as a possibility , we estimated the 134 total amount of microtubules which could be wrapped around a cylinder whose dimensions 135 are roughly equivalent to a contracted L . olor ( Supplementary Methods , Fig . S5 ) . Assuming 136 a maximum surface packing of a helical rod , we found that a single layer spool of microtubule 137 filament is capable of storing over 100 times more microtubule length than the maximum 138 neck length observed ( see SI for details ) . This simple calculation points towards potential 139 helical spooling as a mechanism for cytoskeleton storage . 140 In addition to cortical cytoskeleton , the rapid elongation - retraction cycles also require 141 cell surface area to increase rapidly . Since increasing the surface area of the cell through 142 membrane synthesis occurs too slowly [ 42 ] to account for real time neck elongation and 143 contraction in L . olor , extra membrane must be present in the cell body prior to extension . 144 The most likely possibility is storage of extra membrane via membrane folding [ 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 ] . 145 To approximate how much membrane would need to be stored when in the contracted state , 146 we estimated the surface area of a 1400 µ m neck to be 22 , 000 µ m 2 ( Supplementary Methods ) . 147 However , the surface area of the cell body with a 40 µ m diameter has a much smaller surface 148 area of about 5000 µ m 2 . This would indicate that roughly 22 , 000 µ m 2 or at least four - fold 149 extra membrane would need to be stored in the cell when the neck is fully contracted in our 150 current membrane - storage hypothesis . 151 2 . 4 Multi - layered storage of microtubule bundles in the cortical 152 cytoskeleton 153 To learn how the microtubules might be stored within the cell , we observed the cortical 154 cytoskeleton in L . olor using confocal fluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 3 ) . While all ciliates 155 have a cortical cytoskeleton with low - angle helices ( i . e . Paramecium , Stentor , Dileptus , 156 Spirostomum ) [ 47 ] , L . olor has a a unique helical cortical cytoskeleton architecture which 157 8 varies in helix angle and radius both along the length of the cell and across contracted and 158 elongated states ( Fig . 3A - C , Fig . S2 ) [ 14 , 15 ] . By tracing filaments from experimental data 159 ( see methods ) , we directly measure this helix angle which increases with the cell diameter 160 from 20 º at the tail up to 60 º at the cell body ( Fig . 3B , C ) . In elongated cells , the helix 161 angle again increases starting at the tail up to 80 º and then drops rapidly to 20 º in the 162 neck continuing through to the oral apparatus ( Fig . 3B , C ) . This decrease in helix angle at 163 the base of the neck similarly coincides with the decrease in axi - symmetric diameter of the 164 cell from 40 µ m to 10 µ m ( Fig . 3B , C ) . How microtubules are able attain such high helix 165 angles remains an open question given their large persistence length [ 48 ] due to high stiffness . 166 Potentially , the source of bending in L . olor is assisted by microtubule associated proteins 167 similar to those in microtubule bundles or cilia [ 49 , 50 ] . 168 We term the zone of dramatic change in cell morphology and cytoskeleton as the “tran - 169 sition zone” of the cell , where the Gaussian curvature of the cell transitions from positive 170 over cell body to negative during transition and zero over the cylindrical neck . As the neck 171 elongates , the microtubule filaments which transition from the body to the neck undergo a 172 large geometrical transformation from high - angle helicity and a large helix radius to low - 173 angle helicity and a small helix radius . For the rest of the work , we focus specifically on 174 this transformation and the “transition zone” as both membrane and microtubule network 175 change confirmation via this zone . 176 Higher resolution three dimensional imaging further reveals that what appeared to be a 177 single filament at low magnification is actually a pair of filaments , and that these pairs of 178 filaments are present in multiple layers ( spools , Fig . 3D ) . This layering was most apparent 179 in the cell body ( Fig . 3E - F ) , and is no longer present in the neck of elongated cells ( Fig . 180 3E ) . We confirmed this observation by rotating confocal z - stack data - sets to look head on 181 into the cell . In both the body and the transition zone from the body to the neck two layers 182 of filament pairs were visible ( Fig . 3F , Supplementary Movie 2 ) . The lack of microtubule 183 layering in the neck of an elongated cell , and the presence in the body and transition zone 184 9 of both cells ( Fig . 3E , F ) suggests that the layering is likely a mechanism of microtubule 185 spooling within the cell . We also observed that the microtubule bundles pair together with 186 ciliary pits lining between them ( Fig . 3D - E ) , anchoring ciliary basal bodies to the helical 187 architecture . Thus the pitch and hence the cilia beat force change dramatically as the 188 cytoskeleton geometry evolves with an extending neck . For a higher helical pitch , much of 189 the ciliary beat is aligned along the radial axis while lower helical pitch aligns ciliary beats 190 along the long axis of the cell . This geometrical feedback between cell architecture and 191 surface activity couples hydrodynamic forces generated by individual cilia in the direction 192 of neck extension . Thus the number of cilia involved in neck extension increases and scales 193 with neck length . 194 To the best of our knowledge multi - layer spooling of microtubules has never been re - 195 ported in a cellular context before . A simple three layer spooling of microtubules can easily 196 triple the total length that can be stored in a cell body ( See SI for details ) , allowing the 197 microtubules to be ready for deployment during extensions . The presence of multi - layered 198 microtubules removes the need for filament growth , allowing the cell to store a sufficient 199 length of microtubules filaments to account for the longest neck length extensions observed 200 ( See SI for details , Supplementary Movie 2 ) . 201 Furthermore , since centrin , a calcium - binding protein , is often found in the cortical cy - 202 toskeleton of many ciliates [ 51 , 52 , 53 ] , we further looked for centrin distribution in the 203 cortical cytoskeleton of L . olor . As shown in Figure 3H , centrin forms a highly networked 204 cross - linked ( mesh - like ) structure following the same distribution as microtubules described 205 above ( Fig . 3H ) . The driving force for neck contraction has been hypothesized to be centrin 206 [ 15 , 22 ] which is known to have a calcium - dependent contractile phenotype in a mesh - like 207 form [ 52 , 53 , 51 ] . Beyond it’s potential role in contraction processes for the neck , such 208 a linked cortical cytoskeleton is conducive to inelastic and inextensible sheet - like behavior 209 by allowing for both in - plane rigidity and out - of - plane bending stiffness . As shown in the 210 imaging datasets , the centrin architecture deforms due to extension but is not disrupted 211 10 by repeated cyclic extension and contraction of the neck ( Fig . 3H ) . Inextensibility of the 212 membrane in this context will become relevant in the next few sections . 213 2 . 5 Membrane storage in pleats at the transition zone 214 To understand how the membrane might be stored and redeployed within the cell , we ini - 215 tially performed Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM ) on a fixed cell in an extended state 216 and observed the presence of membrane folds in the body of the organism . These folds 217 correlate exactly to the previously mapped cortical cytoskeleton ( Fig . 3G ) . Next , we per - 218 formed fluorescence imaging using FM4 - 64 ( a membrane marker ) on fixed cells and found 219 that the membrane folds follow a similar helical trajectory as we described previously for 220 microtubules ( Fig . S3 ) . 221 To further quantify the degree of membrane storage and geometry of these membrane 222 folds , next we performed Transmission Electron Microscopy ( TEM ) on fixed cells ( see meth - 223 ods section for details ) . We found clearly defined membrane pleats as opposed to disorganized 224 ruffles seen in many eukaryotic cells ( Fig . 4A - B ) [ 43 , 54 ] . The pleats are uniform and periodic 225 in the contracted cell , with the depth of pleats ranging from 3 µ m in the tail to 2 µ m in the 226 transition zone ( Fig . 4C ) . Remarkably , we also saw a clear transition from a pleated to flat - 227 tened geometry roughly the depth of 1 µ m exactly at the “transition zone” in an elongated 228 cell ( Fig . 4B , D ) . 1 µ m is also the minimal depth of the ciliary pits in the organism ( Fig . 229 4C - D ) . 230 The structure and localization of these membrane pleats allow us to create a more quan - 231 titative definition of the transition zone . We had previously defined the transition zone as 232 the region of slight neck elongation in the active , contracted state of the cell . This new data 233 allows us to define the transition zone as the region where the membrane transitions from 234 pleated ( folded ) to straight ( unfolded ) in an elongated cell , which is highlighted in gray in 235 Figures 4C - D . This transition from folded to unfolded membrane pleats rapidly provides the 236 much needed membrane for long extensions in real - time ( See Supplementary Movie 1 ) . 237 11 2 . 6 Integrated ultrastructure of the membrane and the cortical 238 cytoskeleton 239 Looking more closely at the TEM sections , we additionally observe that the membrane pleats 240 harbor individual cilia ( Fig . 4E ) . The basal bodies are at the bottom of these pleats , with 241 cilia visibly extending from them ( Fig . 4E ) . Additionally , we observed bundles of microtubule 242 filaments lining these membrane pleats ( Fig . 4E , highlighted in orange ) . A closer look at 243 one of these bundles in Figure 4F shows that these bundles are each actually a ribbon of 244 microtubule filaments , and they are localized and anchored with the membrane ( Fig . 4F ) . 245 In both contracted and elongated cells the median width of these microtubule ribbons is 246 386 nm and 408 nm , respectively . Since these are projections of 3D microtubule helices 247 wound around axi - symmetric structures , TEM cross - sections depict projections that show 248 variation which is an artifact of the sectioning . Knowing the diameter of a single microtubule 249 filament [ 55 ] , we estimate that the ribbons roughly contain 14 microtubule filaments ( Fig . 250 4G ) . We further noticed that the microtubule ribbons remain in the same tangential plane 251 of the membrane at all times , providing evidence that they are structurally anchored into 252 the membrane , also seen in other cortical cytoskeleton structures for well studied ciliates 253 [ 40 , 56 ] . The cortical cytoskeleton is normally also linked to the membrane through basal 254 body linkages which mediate translation of force generation from the ciliary activity to the 255 cortical cytoskeleton [ 56 , 57 ] ( Fig . 4D - E ) . 256 The localization of the microtubule ribbons inside the membrane pleats further explains 257 the prior observation of multi - layered microtubules . The association with membrane pleats 258 allows for the microtubule ribbons to spool in a layered architecture and unspool when the 259 pleats unfold in the transition zone as the neck extends . This is further supported by the 260 observation that in contracted cells , the number of microtubule ribbons observed in a mem - 261 brane pleat decreases as the pleat depth decreases in the neck region ( Fig . 4H ) . Correlating 262 structures we observe both in TEM and confocal data , we identify 15 contiguously wrapped 263 pleats which contain 2 - 6 microtubule ribbons ( depending on the depth of the pleat ) of 14 264 12 microtubule filaments . 265 Carefully looking at the pleat structure of the membrane across the whole cell , the ar - 266 chitecture can be mapped to an axi - symmetric curved crease origami . This unique curved , 267 pleated membrane architecture and its associated guiding microtubule ribbons simultane - 268 ously resolve the issue of membrane and cortical cytoskeleton storage necessary for real time 269 “deployment” of a neck - like extension . This integrated membrane / cytoskeleton architecture 270 is unique and to the best of our knowledge has never been seen before . By establishing 271 this static architecture both in contracted and extended states , we next explore how this 272 transition can occur as a function of neck extension . 273 2 . 7 Transition zones as energy barriers for neck deployment 274 We now have a geometrical view of how both membrane and microtubules are stored within 275 the cell enabling large extensions and retractions in short periods of time . However , since 276 microtubule filaments , ribbons and bundles are also known to have large bending and twist 277 energies [ 48 , 58 , 59 , 60 ] , we anticipate that these tightly curved folds of microtubule ribbons 278 should have energetic consequences . To better understand these potential consequences , 279 we began by characterizing the stored energy in a microtubule ribbon ( as described Fig 280 2 , 3 , 4 ) arranged in the helical geometry of L . olor ( Fig . S4 ) . We used the exact curves of the 281 microtubule filaments from 3D confocal fluorescence data . We input these curves to compute 282 both the bending and twisting energies of the microtubule ribbons using discrete forms of 283 bend energy ( E bend = (cid:82) L 0 ( EI x k 21 + EI y k 22 ) ds ) and twist energy ( E twist = (cid:82) L 0 GJk 23 ds ) ( Fig . 284 4I , J , Fig . S4 , see supplementary methods for details ) . Interestingly , we observed a peak in 285 locally stored energy right at the transition zone both in bending and twisting energies of 286 filament ribbons in elongated cells , with a second smaller peak in the bend energy near the 287 base of the cell where the radius of the cell decreases rapidly ( Fig . 4I - J ) . Furthermore , in 288 contracted cells , there is a larger peak in bend energy in the transition zone , yet almost no 289 peak in the twist energy ( Fig . 4I - J ) . 290 13 This calculation , purely based on microtubule geometry , reveals that an energy barrier 291 exists that the microtubule ribbons must pass through as they transition from the spooled 292 ( stored state in a contracted cell ) to extended state in an elongated cell via the transition 293 zone . We now can also view this zone as the site of an energy barrier which the microtubule 294 ribbons must pass through . Similarly , the same energy barrier needs to be crossed for the 295 unspooled microtubules to be spooled again when the cell contracts . This geometrical feature 296 at the point of transition zone thus creates a control anchor point which spatially separates 297 the spooled and unspooled states of the elastic ( membrane - microtubule complex ) system . 298 2 . 8 Curved crease origami provides a framework for understand - 299 ing hyper - extensions at cellular scales 300 Next we examine the role of the “curved crease” pleated origami structure as a control 301 mechanism for deployment of the neck into hyper - extensile states . Although explored as an 302 art form and inspiration for engineering structures and architecture [ 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 , 65 , 66 ] , 303 curved crease origami [ 63 ] remains the lesser known cousin of traditional origami , where 304 folds are made along straight lines . Starting with work by Huffman [ 67 ] , a number of key 305 papers have focused on potential developability of curved crease origami structures [ 64 ] in 306 inextensible thin sheets of paper [ 64 , 68 , 69 , 61 , 70 ] . Additionally , various computational and 307 analytical methods have been established to pleat complex curved surfaces [ 71 ] . However , 308 only a few studies include mechanical responses of curved crease structures , focusing primar - 309 ily on simple geometrical shapes and multi - stable systems [ 69 , 72 , 73 ] . Here we open a new 310 realm in curved crease origami and present a unique hyper - extensile origami architecture at 311 “cellular scale” . 312 As opposed to wrinkled membranes which are disordered and where fold patterns sponta - 313 neously emerge [ 74 ] , the curved creases in the pleated structure of L . olor are specifically pre - 314 scribed by the pattern of microtubule ribbons . Membrane pleats wrap contiguously around 315 the rotationally symmetric cell body , leading to a helicoidal wrapped curved crease pleated 316 14 structure , as is drawn in Figure 5A . This occurs since stiff microtubules define a “fold line” 317 where the inextensible membrane can only bend along the microtubule ribbon , creating a 318 pleat dictated by microtubule placements . 319 Since origami has not been introduced as a paradigm in a cellular context , we first high - 320 light the unique properties of the combined cortical cytoskeleton and membrane architecture 321 which allow us to model the cell using origami . Traditionally , cell membranes are modeled 322 as thin bilayer sheets which can easily bend but cannot stretch ( inextensible ) [ 75 ] . More 323 importantly , cell membranes also show two - dimensional flow due to in - plane shear on the 324 surface of the cell [ 76 ] . In eukaryotic cells , much of this in - plane shear and membrane flu - 325 idity is suppressed due to the presence of a cortical cytoskeleton which adheres to the cell 326 membrane [ 47 , 77 , 78 ] . The presence of both microtubule and centrin mesh networks makes 327 the cell membrane in L . olor much more like a thin inextensible sheet with very low bend - 328 ing rigidity . This conceptual similarity in properties across thin sheets such as paper and 329 the cytoskeleton - coupled membrane of a cell allows us to explore origami as a conceptual 330 framework to mimic the structure of the membrane folds in L . olor . 331 As the neck elongates , the pleats unfold and smooth out in the neck ( Fig . 4 ) providing 332 the extra membrane needed for real - time deployment of the neck . We schematically depict 333 this unfolding in Figure 5A , where pleats are present in the body of the cell but not in the 334 neck with a sharp change at the transition zone . But how does the cell control where the 335 pleats will open and where they remain folded ? In order to better understand this transition , 336 we explore how a helicoidal , pleated , curved crease origami unfolds when stretched . 337 We created a physical model of membrane storage which mimics that of L . olor by scoring 338 a sheet of origami paper at various angles ( 15 º , 30 º , 45 º , 60 º , 75 º ) ( Fig . 5B , C ) . We then 339 wrapped these sheets into a cylindrical , helical geometry . Here we note that the chirality 340 of the paper origami ( seen in Fig . 5B , C , right handed ) is opposite of that of the cell ( left 341 handed ) , but that has no impact on the mechanics of this structure . To make clear the 342 stored membrane , we colored the sections between the pleats to represent the membrane 343 15 that folds and unfolds from the groove . Thus the total colored surface area of the cylinder in 344 this barber - pole - like - origami represents new membrane that is deployed when the cylinder 345 is extended ( Fig . 5C , Supplementary Movie 4 ) . 346 As we unfolded the cylinders , we note that for a single pleat to unfold both the mountain 347 and valley folds have to open ( Fig . 5B ) . Thus , by definition , a single pleat has two associated 348 singularities where the crease goes sharply from folded to unfolded state . These singularities , 349 classically known as d - cones in origami literature [ 68 , 79 ] , travel as the pleat unfolds in the 350 transition zone as a function of time ( Fig . 5B ) . Here we use the word travel in material 351 frame of reference of the cell while the singularity remains stationary in the transition zone 352 in lab frame of reference . 353 The particular singularity we find at the pleat was first described in context of crumpled 354 paper : a developable cone ( d - cone ) [ 79 , 80 , 81 , 68 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 ] . This is the simplest of all 355 topological crumpling deformations , where energy focusing introduces a very sharp curvature 356 and much of the strain localizes at the tip . Although the dynamics and interactions of d - 357 cones have been described in literature [ 84 ] , they have not been studied in the context of 358 pleat folding or unfolding . 359 Moreover , since these singularities are needed for all pleats to open , each of the 15 pleated 360 grooves along the cross - sectional radius of the cell must have two d - cone singularities in 361 the transition zone . Since d - cone singularities on a surface are coupled by an inextensible 362 material they are known to interact on the surface of a sheet . This unique constraint provides 363 a symmetric neck extension and does not allow one pleat to open without the other 15 pleats 364 also opening synchronously . Any runaway singularity will not be geometrically compatible 365 with the symmetry of the extension , and will slow down to catch up with other d - cone 366 singularities lagging behind . Although it is believed that d - cone singularities coordinate and 367 interact in the classical example of crumpled paper , this coordination of d - cones has not 368 been previously observed [ 83 ] in the context of curved crease origami . We directly visualize 369 this process in our high - speed origami unfolding experiments by seeding the initial d - cones 370 16 and keeping one side of the cylinder ( right ) open during extension . Because of the nature 371 of the singularity , it is more costly to generate a new singularity at a location further down 372 the helix as compared to just moving the d - cone along the helical path . The singularities in 373 our experiment travel helically in a synchronized manner as the serial unfolding takes place , 374 controlling the extension process ( Fig . 5C , Supplementary Movie 4 , high speed ) . Since 375 d - cone propagation requires a critical threshold force [ 84 ] , this geometrical feature further 376 adds to the energy barrier that controls the deployment of microtubules in the neck . Thus 377 for spooling or deployment to occur , the critical threshold force of extension must be higher 378 than the critical propagation force for all the coupled d - cones . 379 It is useful to contrast this helical barber - pole - like curved crease origami structure with 380 another classical curved crease pleated origami on a cylinder : a flexible drinking straws [ 86 ] , 381 where the pleats are concentric rings transverse to the cylinder . These pleats can also store 382 extra membrane and deploy a linear structure while being pulled along the axis of symmetry . 383 However , distinct from the “barber pole curved crease origami” in L . olor where singularities 384 control sequential deployment at the transition zone , the pleats here open stochastically and 385 “pop” spontaneously anywhere along the cylinder as the structure is pulled via extension 386 ( Fig . S6 ) . This comparison highlights the role of helicoidal geometry in a pleated setting 387 where geometrical singularities control sequential deployment of the spooled membrane and 388 microtubule network during neck deployment . 389 We additionally observed that there is a chirality induced asymmetry in the cylinders 390 ( Fig . 5E ) . When unconstrained , the helical curved crease origami also shows a unique 391 asymmetry based on chirality of the fold pattern . When the target origami cylinders are 392 observed from the front or from the back end , we observed that there is an asymmetry 393 associated with the ends ( Fig . 5E ) . However , we do not have a mechanistic understanding 394 yet of how this asymmetry emerges . 395 17 2 . 9 Twist singularity in microtubule ribbons at the transition zone 396 To further incorporate elastic structures in the context of curved crease origami of membrane 397 pleats seen in L . olor , we next explore the unique role of microtubule ribbons that follow and 398 template the membrane pleats along the grooves . As shown in Figure 4 , with each pleat we 399 observed in both TEM and confocal data there were microtubule ribbons on either side of the 400 basal body , which would be on both sides of the fold line in our curved crease origami . Since 401 microtubules are significantly stiffer compared to the membrane ( 1 . 2 GPa Young Modulus of 402 microtubules , and by convention a membrane bending rigidity of 20 k b T ) [ 48 ] , microtubules 403 seed and guide the pleat formation . D - cones moving along the helix can not cross these 404 guiding microtubule tracks . 405 However , careful observation of this unique ribbon - sheet geometry reveals another cou - 406 pled singularity during transition of a pleat from folded to unfolded state . Microtubule 407 ribbons present on the inner side of the folded pleat undergo a unique transformation when 408 a d - cone traverses the geometry to unfold the pleats . In order for the pleat to open , one set 409 of microtubule ribbons on the inner pleat must twist 180 degrees , flipping it’s orientation 410 in order to maintain the same face of attachment towards the membrane ( Fig . 5H ) . To 411 depict this geometrical transformation , we made “barber pole” curved crease origami out of 412 transparent mylar and embedded elastic bamboo filaments across the pleat ( Fig . 5H ) . As 413 the cylinder transitions from a folded to an unfolded state , we observed the twist from the 414 uncolored to the colored side of one of the filaments as the d - cones traveled down the curved 415 pleat ( Fig . 5G ) . The twist in the bamboo filaments creates a very large energy barrier , resist - 416 ing this reorientation due to a twist domain wall singularity . We had previously identified a 417 twist energy barrier of these microtubule ribbons purely from the congruent geometry of the 418 membrane and microtubules ( Fig . 4I - J ) . The discovery of this domain wall is an additional 419 180 degree twist ( occuring in the region bounded by the two d - cones ) that increases the 420 contribution of twist energy barrier 10 - fold ( Fig . 5F , ribbon twist ) in the transition zone . 421 Previously , twist in cytoskeletal filaments has been explored in the context of membrane 422 18 adhesion energy [ 87 , 88 ] . This work in bacterial cells led to discovery of unique couplings 423 between the cytoskeleton , membrane curvature , and geometry [ 87 , 88 ] . In our work , we find 424 that the microtubule ribbon remains attached to the membrane and hence has to twist as 425 pleats open . The above described twist is bounded by the two d - cones which define pleat 426 opening , as shown in Fig . 5H ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . The creases along which the d - cones travel as the 427 pleat unfolds from left to right are labeled as B - B’ and C - C’ . Ribbon 2 undergoes twist , while 428 ribbons 1 and 3 remain in the same plane . The strength of the coupled d - cones defines the 429 length scale of the opening pleats and hence the rate of twist in the microtubule ribbon . This 430 coupling further ensures that this geometry propagates backwards in the material frame of 431 reference of the cell , while remaining stationary in the lab frame of reference ( at the transition 432 zone ) . The constancy of this region in the lab frame during deployment of our physical models 433 also reflects a quasi - static force balance . The cilia - driven pull force is balanced by the energy 434 dissipation of the coupled d - cones and twisting ribbons . Microtubule and membrane pass 435 through the transition zone synchronously while unspooling during deployment ( and spooling 436 during recovery ) , the rate of which is controlled by the singularities and the twisted ribbon . It 437 is important to note , unlike a symmetrical propagation of a d - cone [ 84 ] , our unique geometry 438 forces d - cones to travel and the ribbons to twist along curved creases , a geometrical case 439 that is yet to be explored . We will further analyze this unique coupled membrane - ribbon 440 geometry and its associated physical properties in a future publication . 441 2 . 10 Poisson ratio of a deployable curved crease origami 442 As we observed the extension of cylinders with varying helix angle θ , we noticed that in 443 all of the origami experiments the diameter of the cylinder increased post - extension , giving 444 the extensions a negative poisson ratio ( Fig . 5C , D ) . However , during elongation , the neck 445 decreases its net diameter . This can be explained by adding limited shear that a cortical cy - 446 toskeletal decorated membrane can support . The models for origami experiment are made of 447 a thin sheets of paper which are incompressible and do not support shear . A thin membrane 448 19 with bound centrin and microtubules as in L . olor is incompressible in 2d as well , but does 449 support limited shear which is driven by ciliary activity . Evidence of this shear extension is 450 present in our cell manipulation experiment . 451 In order to demonstrate this , we hold a live cell under micro - pipettes both at the neck 452 ( oral apparatus ) and its tail . Next , we gently extend this cell systematically by application of 453 extension force ( see methods ) . During the neck extension of 47 . 45 µ m , from 126 . 23 to 173 . 68 454 µ m in 4 . 063s , the cell rotates 128 . 28 ◦ , rotating at a speed of 31 . 57 ◦ / s ( Fig . 5I , Supplementary 455 Movie 3 ) , also confirming the chiral nature of the microtubule structure . 456 Thus hyper - extensibility in L . olor is primarily driven by spooling and unspooling of 457 microtubule and membrane architecture along the long axis . A secondary shear provides 458 further yet limited extension along the pull axis . Initially , d - cone propagation generates 459 sequential deployment of microtubule and membrane through the transition zone and into 460 the neck . The d - cone and microtubule unspooling from the pleats give more surface area 461 ( membrane storage ) and microtubule cytoskeleton during extension . The associated singu - 462 larities from folded to unfolded states control an organized deployment of the membrane 463 and microtubule network . Initially , this leads to a negative poisson ratio in the cylinder . 464 As the neck is pulled further , a limited shear - induced extension of the neck . During this 465 final extension the neck decreases in diameter , achieving the positive poisson ratio we have 466 observed in L . olor . 467 3 Discussion and Outlook 468 In our work , we share a new mechanism of cellular morphological dynamics which are based 469 on the storage , rapid deployment , and recovery of a neck - like protrusion , and which are 470 harnessed by a cell to create a deployable neck - like structure utilized in capturing prey . In 471 order to understand this hyper - extension in a single cell , we demonstrated a new curved 472 crease origami architecture at the cellular scale . We found 15 curved pleats present in the 473 20 cell , always folding in a left - handed helix . The pleats connect to the oral grove at the tip 474 of the neck , seeding the d - cone defects that move along the helix during deployment . We 475 mark the key features of our model , including a coupled d - cone and twist singularity that 476 defines the transition zone shown in Fig . 6 . Repeatable extension and contraction of this 477 hyper - extensile neck is controlled by the exact synchronized singularities at the transition 478 zone . This property creates a non - affine extensible structure which deploys linearly from the 479 transition zone instead of extending like a simple spring . This further preserves the overall 480 shape of the cell and protects the sub - cellular components in the cell body . The mechanism 481 we describe is reversible , thus the unspooled membrane and microtubule filaments can be 482 spooled back , over and over again . The shapes of many protists are highly dynamic and 483 require fast morphological changes . The principles identified in L . olor which enable its 484 unique rapid , reversibile , hyper - extensions can also help us understand the behaviors of other 485 cells or biological systems . Microtubules , for example , are found in the cortical cytoskeleton 486 of all ciliates [ 89 , 47 ] , and the membranes can adopt complex structures which may aid in 487 cellular morphology . Unique centrin architectures have previously been described in other 488 ciliates [ 51 , 52 , 53 ] , further adding geometrical constraints on the membrane . Combinations 489 of other types of filaments such as actin with membranous thin sheets can further expand the 490 repertoire of shape dynamics in protists , a rarely studied genre of cells . As high resolution 491 volumetric imaging for a broad range of cells continues to grow , our approach for linking 492 cytoskeletal and membrane geometry to cell function will be broadly applicable . 493 The work presented here also has implications in the design of macro , micro or nanorobotics . 494 The stability and geometrical control of the barber pole architecture we described can be used 495 for linear deployable structures , with applications ranging from space to medical robotics . It 496 is remarkable to contemplate that L . olor undergoes repeated extreme morphological varia - 497 tion tests ( 20k + runs for a single cell ) , and is able to continually perform its desired function 498 robustly . With our discovery of curved crease origami in a living cell , we intend to inspire 499 similar robust , multi - stable abiotic structures where geometrical singularities encoded in 500 21 origami patterns control unique kinetic behavior . 501 Data Availability 502 All datasets are deposited at ( DOI : 10 . 5061 / dryad . 4xgxd25g0 ) . 503 Acknowledgements 504 We thank all members of the Prakash lab ( past and present ) for helpful discussions .

( E ) In the final , most - elongated cell , we highlight the 3 regimes which are required for hyper - extension : the transition zone where the membrane is pleated , the zone where singularities propagate and the pleats sequentially unfold , and the last zone where the neck undergoes limited shear , resulting in thin hyper - extensions . In the neck of this last cell , inset ( 3 ) shows that the microtubule ribbons and the basal bodies are now most visible as the pleats are unfolded . 33 References 520 [ 1 ] Remedios , C . G .
