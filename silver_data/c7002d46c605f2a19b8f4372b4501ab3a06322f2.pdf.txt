We have shown that these two chemokines are activated by the mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) and p38 for IL - 8 , and Jun - terminal kinase ( JNK ) for MCP - 1 . It is also well established that transcription of each of these chemokines is tightly controlled by the nuclear factor kappa B ( NFκB ) transcription factor family . Therefore , we sought to better understand the differential regulation of chemokine expression by NFκB in adenoviral infection of the cornea . Methods : Primary keratocytes derived from human donor corneas were treated with signaling inhibitors and small interfering RNA specific to MAPKs , and infected with adenovirus for different time periods before analysis . Activation of specific NFκB subunits was analyzed by western blot , confocal microscopy , electromobility shift assay , and chromatin immunoprecipitation , and chemokine expression was quantified by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay . Results : Upon adenoviral infection , NFκB p65 , p50 , and cREL subunits translocate to the nucleus . This translocation is blocked by inhibitors of specific MAPK signaling pathways . Confocal microscopy showed that inhibitors of the p38 , JNK , and ERK pathways differentially inhibited NFκB nuclear translocation , while PP2 , an inhibitor of Src family kinases , completely inhibited NFκB nuclear translocation . Western blot analysis revealed that activation of specific NFκB subunits was time dependent following infection . Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that binding of NFκB p65 and p50 subunits to the IL - 8 promoter upon viral infection was differentially reduced by chemical inhibitors of MAPKs . Electromobility shift assay and luciferase assay analysis revealed that transactivation of IL - 8 occurred with binding by the NFκB p65 homodimer or NFκB p65 / p50 heterodimer as early as 1 h post infection , whereas MCP - 1 expression was dependent upon the NFκB cREL but not the p65 subunit , and occurred 4 h after IL - 8 induction . Finally , knockdown of NFκB p65 by short interfering RNA abrogated IL - 8 but not MCP - 1 expression after adenoviral infection . Conclusion : The kinetics of NFκB subunit activation are partly responsible for the observed pattern of acute inflammation in the adenoviral - infected cornea . MAPKs differentially regulate chemokine expression in adenoviral keratitis by differential and time - dependent activation of specific NFκB subunits . An acute inflammatory response to infection or injury occurs in stereotyped stages irrespective of invading organism or mechanism of injury , with neutrophils being the first cells to infiltrate the tissue or body cavity , followed shortly by monocytes [ 1 ] . This pattern appears to be the result of the specific induction and activity of chemokines , proteins elicited by cells that induce the directed migration of leukocytes into tissue sites of inflammation [ 2 ] , by infected or injured cells . Possible molecular mechanisms at play in the tightly controlled pattern of acute inflammation include transcriptional induction , transcriptional repression , and mRNA stability . In particular , it has been shown that AU - rich elements in mRNA contribute stability to the molecule and in part serve to control the kinetics of gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines [ 3 ] .

Interleukin - 8 ( IL - 8 ) is one of the earliest chemokines to be expressed in infection and acts as a first line of defense via its capacity to elicit neutrophil chemotaxis , and to a lesser degree monocyte and T - cell chemotaxis [ 4 - 6 ] . IL - 8 induction following viral infection has been shown by many independent research groups [ 7 - 10 ] , and a wide variety of cells produce IL - 8 , including microglia and astrocytes [ 11 - 13 ] . However , in the corneal stroma the molecular mechanisms that regulate IL - 8 expression following adenoviral infection remain unclear . Our study focuses on the kinetics of transcription of IL - 8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP - 1 ) , another key chemokine in adenoviral keratitis , and on the role of the NFκB transcription factor family in chemokine activation . The nuclear factor - κB ( NFκB ) family of transcription factors controls expression of well over one hundred genes , the majority of which participate in regulating innate and adaptive immunity [ 14 , 15 ] . Activation of NFκB occurs within minutes after an appropriate stimulus and leads to strong Molecular Vision 2009 ; 15 : 2879 - 2889 < http : / / www . molvis . org / molvis / v15 / a304 > Received 13 October 2009 | Accepted 18 December 2009 | Published 25 December 2009 © 2009 Molecular Vision 2879 transcriptional stimulation of both viral and cellular genes [ 7 , 16 - 18 ] . Analysis of the transcriptional regulation of chemokines induced by viral infection is critical to understanding the pathogenesis of viral keratitis . However , the mechanisms that connect viral infection to chemokine expression by infected stromal cells are poorly understood [ 7 , 19 - 22 ] . In general , chemokine gene expression is controlled by the NFκB transcription factor family , p65 , RELB , cREL , NFκB1 ( p50 / 100 ) , and NFκB2 ( p52 / 105 ) . These proteins form specific homo - or heterodimers for transcriptional activation of target genes in a cell - specific manner . NFκB subunit activation can be achieved through two main pathways : canonical ( classical ) , characterized by the activation of the IκB kinase ( IKK ) complex , including both IKKα and IKKβ ; and non - canonical ( non - classical ) , characterized by activation of NFκB - inducing kinase and IKKα , but not IKKβ [ 23 - 28 ] . Therefore , it is the specific activation of upstream IKKs that represents the point of divergence for NFκB activation . Activation of these pathways has been determined to be both cell and stimulus specific [ 26 - 28 ] . The canonical pathway is the route most commonly activated by pathogens , and is stimulated by pathogen - associated molecular patterns and cytokines . The non - canonical pathway has been described particularly in B lymphocytes , and is stimulated by B - cell activating factor , lymphotoxin β , and CD40L [ 27 , 29 ] . Lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella enterica was shown to activate both canonical and non - canonical pathways in primary B cells with activation of both NFκB p50 / RELA and p52 / RELB heterodimers [ 26 ] . Herpes simplex virus type 1 ICP27 protein was shown to activate NFκB via the canonical pathway [ 30 ] . While the role of NFκB in apoptosis following adenoviral infection has been explored [ 31 ] , its role in cytokine regulation due to viral infection has been less fully addressed . We have earlier shown that NFκB p65 is activated upon adenoviral infection in conjunction with the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase / protein kinase B ( PI3K / AKT ) pathway for cell survival during viral replication [ 31 ] , but activation of NFκB p65 as a possible mechanism for chemokine induction in adenoviral infection has not been explored . Our prior studies in a mouse model of adenoviral keratitis have shown expression of KC ( a homologue of IL - 8 in the mouse ) within 4 h of infection , followed by MCP - 1 at 16 h post infection [ 32 ] . In this report we address the role of specific NFκB subunit activation in the kinetics of IL - 8 and MCP - 1 expression in adenoviral - infected human corneal cells . METHODS Materials : Antibodies to p38 , IKKα / β , NFκB p65 , NFκB p50 , IκB , cREL , and their phosphorylated counterparts were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology ( Beverly , MA ) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Delaware , CA ) . The anti - human IL - 8 and MCP - 1 antibodies and biotin - conjugated anti - human IL - 8 and MCP - 1 antibodies were obtained from BD PharMingen ( San Diego , CA ) . Inhibitors to p38 ( SB203580 ) , JNK ( SP600125 ) , ERK ( PD98059 ) , and Src ( PP2 ) were purchased from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , CA ) . NFκB p65 - specific and jumbled control siRNA were purchased from Imgenex ( San Diego , CA ) . The IL - 8 luciferase construct was a kind gift from Dr . R . Natarjan ( Virginia Commonwealth Univ ) . The luciferase measuring kit and Renilla constructs were purchased from Promega , ( Madison , WI ) , and the LightShift Chemiluminescent kit from Pierce ( Rockford , IL ) . Cell culture and viruses : Primary keratocytes were derived from donor corneas as previously described [ 33 ] . Briefly , after mechanical debridement of the corneal epithelium and endothelium , corneas were cut into 2 mm diameter sections , and each section placed in individual wells of 6 - well Falcon Tissue Culture Plates ( Fisher Scientific , Pittsburgh , PA ) with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) , containing 10 % heat inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , penicillin G sodium , and streptomycin sulfate . Corneal fragments were removed prior to monolayer confluence . Cells were grown and maintained at 37 o C in 5 % CO 2 . Cells from multiple donors were pooled , and the cell monolayers used at passage three . For inhibitor analysis , cells were pretreated with SB203580 ( 10 µM ) , SP600125 ( 25 µM ) , PD98059 ( 25 µM ) , and PP2 ( 10 µM ) at 37 °C for 3 h before infection , and were exposed to the inhibitors at the same concentrations throughout the infection process . The protocol for use of corneas from deceased human donors was approved by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Human Studies Committee , and conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki . Human adenovirus species D type 19 ( HAdV - D19 ) used in this study was cultured directly from the cornea of a patient with EKC [ 33 ] , and purified by cesium chloride gradient . The virus was grown in human lung carcinoma cells ( A549 cells , CCL 185 ; American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD ) in Minimum Essential Media ( MEM ) with 2 % FBS , penicillin G sodium , streptomycin sulfate , and amphotericin B . The State of Oklahoma Department of Health confirmed the viral serotype . Typical adenoviral cytopathic effect , positive immunofluorescent staining for adenovirus hexon proteins , and increasing titers of virus within one week after infection of human corneal cells were seen ( data not shown ) . Viral infection : Monolayer cell cultures were grown to 95 % confluence , serum starved overnight , inhibitor treated for 3 h in Opti - MEM ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 50 or mock infected with virus - free dialysis buffer as a control . Transfection : Transient transfections were done in 6 well plates using FuGENE 6 ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) as per the manufacturer’s instructions . A total of 2 μg DNA was transfected , including NFκB p65 or control siRNA ( Imgenex , San Diego , CA ) , IL - 8 luciferase construct , and pRL - TK Molecular Vision 2009 ; 15 : 2879 - 2889 < http : / / www . molvis . org / molvis / v15 / a304 > © 2009 Molecular Vision 2880 construct , the latter to measure renilla luciferase activity as an internal control . The transfection mixture was prepared by mixing 3 μl of FuGENE 6 in 47 μl of serum - free DMEM , incubated at room temperature for 5 min , the DNA added , and further incubated for 15 min , prior to transfection of 70 – 80 % confluent cells . Viral infections were carried out 48 h post - transfection , and supernatants and cell lysates collected at various time points after infection for enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) and luciferase assay , respectively . Immunoblot analysis : Adenoviral - and mock - infected keratocytes were lysed with chilled cell lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 2 . 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 1 mM β - glycerolphosphate , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 μg / ml leupeptin , and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride [ PMSF ] ) , and incubated at 4 ºC for 5 min . The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 21 , 000× g for 15 min . The protein concentration of each supernatant was measured by bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) analysis ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) and equalized . Twenty micrograms of cell lysates were subsequently separated by 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes ( BioRad , Hercules , CA ) . The bands were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . Luciferase assay : Short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) transfected , viral - or mock - infected cells were lysed with 500 μl of 1× partial lysis buffer by rocking at room temperature for 15 min . For the assay , 20 μl cleared cell lysate was added to 100 μl luciferase assay reagent ( Promega , Madison , WI ) , followed by 100 μl Stop and Glo reagent ( Promega ) to measure renilla luciferase activity as an internal control . IL - 8 luciferase activity was then normalized against renilla luciferase activity and analyzed by one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with preplanned contrasts , with α = 0 . 05 . Enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) : The cell supernatants were collected at various time points up to 4 h post infection , and the levels of IL - 8 and MCP - 1 quantified by sandwich ELISA . The detection limit was 30 pg / ml . Plates were read on a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) and analyzed with SOFTmax analysis software ( Molecular Devices ) . The means of triplicate ELISA values for each of the viral - and mock - infected wells were compared by one - way ANOVA with preplanned contrasts , with α = 0 . 05 . Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay ( EMSA ) : Nuclear extracts from adenoviral - or mock - infected keratocytes were prepared using Nucbuster ( Novagen , Madison , WI ) , and binding and supershift assays done using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit ( Pierce ) , according to the manufacturers’ instructions . Briefly , chemokine sense and antisense oligonucleotides encoding specific binding sites for NFκB were synthesized ( IDT , Coralville , IA ) . Oligonucleotides were then labeled using Biotin - ddUTP and terminal transferase for 15 min at 37 ° C in the labeling buffer and then annealed . For the assay , 10 μg of nuclear extract , labeled oligonucleotide , poly ( dI - dC ; 1 μg ) , and poly L - lysine ( 0 . 1 μg ) were mixed in the binding buffer and incubated at room temperature for 15 min . For comparison , 100 molar excess of unlabelled probe was added to the reactions 15 min before the addition of labeled probe . For the supershift assay , 1 or 2 μg antibody to NFκB p65 , p50 , or cREL was added to the binding reaction and incubated on ice for 30 min . Protein - DNA complexes were resolved in 5 % pre - electrophoresed polyacrylamide gel in 0 . 5× TBE running buffer and then transferred to a nylon membrane ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) . The membrane was then probed for anti - biotin and the bands were detected by chemiluminescence using Kodak films and developed in a QCP X - Ray film processor in which each film is exposed for a preset time . Densitometric analysis of EMSA was performed using ImageQuant 5 . 2 ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) in the linear range of detection , and absolute values then normalized to binding in mock - infected cells . The means of normalized replicate EMSA values for each condition were compared by one - way ANOVA with preplanned contrasts , with α = 0 . 05 . Confocal microscopy : Keratocytes grown on chamber slides ( Nunc , Rochester , NY ) were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide or inhibitor for 3 h and then infected with adenovirus or dialysis buffer for 20 min . Cells were partially fixed in 0 . 05 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min , washed in PBS containing 2 % FBS , and permeabilized in solution containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min . After 30 min blocking in 3 % FBS - PBS , the cells were incubated in 5 μg / ml of NFκB p65 , p50 , and cREL primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature , washed , and incubated in Alexafluor - 594 and Alexafluor - 488 conjugated secondary antibody ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) for 1 h more at room temperature . Cells were then washed , fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde , and mounted using Vectashield ( Vector labs , Burlingame , CA ) mounting medium containing DAPI . Images were taken with an Olympus FluoView 500 confocal microscope using a 60× water immersion objective . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) : For ChIP , inhibitor treated and viral - or mock - infected cells were subjected to cross - linking for 10 min in 1 % formaldehyde at 37 °C , incubated with 0 . 125 M glycine for 5 min , and then washed twice in cold PBS containing protease inhibitors before resuspension in sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) lysis buffer ( 1 % SDS , 10 mM EDTA , 50 mM Tris ; pH 8 ) , also containing protease inhibitors . After incubation on ice for 10 min , the suspension was sonicated to reduce the DNA lengths to 200 – 1 , 000 bp , centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min , and the supernatant used for immunoprecipitation . Sonicated extracts were precleared with protein A / G beads ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) plus 50 μg salmon sperm DNA for 30 min at 4 °C before incubation with either anti - Molecular Vision 2009 ; 15 : 2879 - 2889 < http : / / www . molvis . org / molvis / v15 / a304 > © 2009 Molecular Vision 2881 NFκB p65 , p50 , cREL or control rabbit IgG overnight at 4 °C . Immunocomplexes were precipitated with blocked protein A / G beads for 1 h . The beads were washed once in low - salt buffer ( 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 2 mM EDTA , 20 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl ; pH 8 ) , once in high - salt buffer ( containing 500 mM NaCl ) , once in LiCl buffer ( 0 . 25 M LiCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 mM EDTA , 10 mM Tris ; pH 8 ) , and twice in Tris - EDTA buffer . DNA - protein complexes were eluted with 0 . 1 M NaHCO 3 and 0 . 2 % SDS , and cross - linking was reversed by incubation at 65 °C for 4 h . Proteinase K ( 10 μg ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and 2 μl of DNase - free RNase A ( 10 mg / ml ; Roche ) were added for 2 h at 50 °C . The remaining immunoprecipitated DNA was phenol - chloroform purified and subjected to PCR using specific IL - 8 and MCP - 1 primers . Of the total lysate , 5 % was used as a loading control . RESULTS Activation of NFκB subunits and their inhibitory kinase ( IκB ) in adenoviral infection : In the absence of stimulation , NFκB components are sequestered in the cytoplasm by a tight association with inhibitory proteins of the IκB family . Upon stimulation , IκB is phosphorylated by IKK - containing complexes , releasing NFκB subunits and leading ultimately to the degradation of IκB via the ubiquitin - proteosome pathway [ 27 ] , and translocation of NFκB to the nucleus for specific transcriptional activity . We infected human keratocytes for 1 and 4 h and performed immunoblot analysis for phosphorylation of specific NFκB subunits , IKKα / β , and IκB . After 1 h , adenoviral infection induced phosphorylation of NFκB p65 and p50 , IKKα / β , and IκB but not cREL ( Figure 1A ) . Phosphorylation of p65 , IKKα / β , and IκB was reduced by inhibitors of p38 MAPK ( SB203580 ) , ERK ( PD ) , and Src ( PP2 ; Figure 1A ) . However , the JNK inhibitor ( SP600125 ) only partially reduced the activation of NFκB p65 , IKKα / β , and IκB , consistent with our previous observation that these MAPK have different downstream targets in adenoviral - infected cells [ 7 , 8 , 34 ] , possibly because JNK is not involved in IL - 8 induction . At 4 h post infection , we observed increased cREL phosphorylation in viral - infected cells as compared to mock - treated cells ( Figure 1B ) . These results indicate that IκB and members of the NFκB family are activated rapidly upon adenoviral infection , and that their activation is dependent on upstream kinases shown previously to be important to chemokine expression by adenoviral - infected cells [ 7 , 8 ] . IL - 8 and MCP - 1 promoter binding activity of NFκB subunits in adenoviral infection : In general , NFκB transcription factors are activated rapidly after exposure to viral infection , resulting in a strong transcriptional regulation of a multitude of early viral and cellular genes [ 35 ] . We previously reported the activation of NFκB p65 in a PI3K / AKT dependent manner upon adenoviral infection that ensured delayed cell death and promoted viral replication [ 31 ] . EMSA performed on adenoviral - infected keratocytes at 1 h post infection showed NFκB binding to the IL - 8 promoter as distinguished from Figure 1 . Activation of NFκB subunits upon adenoviral infection in keratocytes is shown . Whole cell extracts from 1 h post viral - infected ( V ) or mock - treated ( M ) cells , pretreated with signaling inhibitors SB203580 ( SB : p38 ) , SP600125 ( SP : JNK ) , PD98059 ( PD : ERK ) , or PP2 ( Src ) were run on a 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted using anti - phospho - NFκB p65 , NFκB p50 , cREL , IKKα / β and IκB antibodies . Viral - infected cells showed increased activation of NFκB p65 , NFκB p50 , IKKα / β and IκB both at ( A ) 1 h and ( B ) 4 h after infection . cREL phosphorylation was unchanged at 1 h , but increased at 4 h post infection . Actin levels to determine equivalent protein loading are shown . Phosphorylation of p65 , IKKα / β , and IκB was reduced by SB , PD , and PP2 but SP only partially reduced the activation of NFκB p65 , IKKα / β , and IκB ( A ) . At 4 h post infection , cREL phosphorylation in viral - infected cells was reduced by all inhibitors used ( B ) .

In viral - infected cells , antibody specific to each NFκB subunit appeared to reduce binding , as indicated by reduced density of the primary band , demonstrating the possible involvement of NFκB homodimers or heterodimers in the activation of IL - 8 gene expression . Specificity of probe binding was shown by use of 100 molar excess of unlabelled probe ( data not shown ) . We have previously shown that chemical inhibition of JNK has no effect on IL - 8 expression by adenoviral - infected keratocytes . Similarly , the JNK inhibitor appeared to have no effect on NFκB binding to the IL - 8 promoter , while inhibitors of p38 , ERK , and Src reduced NFκB binding ( Figure 2A ) . Statistically , overall binding was significantly greater in viral - infected cells as compared to mock - infected cells ( Figure 2B , p < 0 . 0001 , ANOVA ) . IL - 8 promoter binding of NFκB subunits was significantly reduced by all four inhibitors ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Antibody binding / shift on the IL - 8 promoter was not observed in mock - treated cells or in cells treated with any inhibitor prior to infection ( Figure 2B , p > 0 . 05 ) . These data correlated with our western blots ( Figure 1 ) and our previous observation that JNK regulates expression of MCP - 1 but not IL - 8 [ 34 ] . At 1 h after infection , we did not observe significant binding of NFκB subunits to the MCP - 1 promoter ( Figure 2C ) . However , at 4 h post infection , NFκB subunit binding to the MCP - 1 promoter was significantly greater in viral - infected cells as compared to mock - infected cells ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . All 3 subunits , but in particular cREL , bound to the MCP - 1 promoter at 4 h after infection ( Figure 2C ) , indicating that IL - 8 and MCP - 1 may be regulated at different time points and by different NFκB dimers . We occasionally but not consistently observed low levels of NFκB p65 binding to the MCP - 1 promoter ( data not shown ) . By graphical analysis of multiple EMSA experiments , for MCP - 1 , only the JNK inhibitor reduced binding , consistent with a JNK - specific activation pathway for MCP - 1 ( Figure 2D , p < 0 . 05 ) . For the MCP - 1 Figure 2 . IL - 8 promoter binding activity of NFκB subunits is reduced by specific inhibitors . A : EMSA was done using 10 μg nuclear extracts after 1 h of viral ( V ) or mock ( M ) treatment in cells pretreated with signaling inhibitors SB203580 ( SB : p38 ) , SP600125 ( SP : JNK ) , PD98059 ( PD : ERK ) , or PP2 ( Src ) . Binding of p65 to the IL - 8 promoter appeared greater in viral - infected cells ( lane 1 ) as compared to mock - treated cells ( lane 5 ) , and was reduced in cells pretreated with SB ( lane 9 ) and PP2 ( lane 21 ) , but not with SP ( lane 13 ) or PD ( lane 17 ) . Supershift assays with NFκB p65 , p50 and cREL revealed more shift in viral - infected and SP - treated cells ( lanes 2 – 4 and 14 – 16 ) , but reduced shift or no shift in mock - treated ( lanes 6 – 8 ) or other inhibitor - treated cells : SB ( lanes 10 – 12 ) , PD ( lanes 18 – 20 ) , and PP2 ( lanes 22 – 24 ) . B : Graphic representation of five independent EMSA experiments . Overall binding was significantly greater in viral - infected cells as compared to mock - treated cells ( p < 0 . 0001 , ANOVA ) . IL - 8 promoter binding of NFκB subunits was significantly reduced by all four inhibitors ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Antibody binding / shift on the IL - 8 promoter was not observed in mock - treated cells or in cells treated with any inhibitor prior to infection ( p > 0 . 05 ) . C : EMSA done for MCP - 1 at both 1 and 4 h post infection . Viral infection induced binding / shift relative to mock infection only at 4 h post infection ( lanes 1 and 5 ) . Binding at 4 h post infection was reduced in mock - treated and inhibitor - pretreated groups ( lanes 5 – 24 ) . At 4 h post infection , antibody to p50 and cREL reduced binding ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , but antibody to p65 ( lane 2 ) did not . D : Graphical representation of five independent EMSA experiments for MCP - 1 at 4 h post infection . Overall binding was significantly greater in viral - infected cells as compared to mock - treated cells at 4 h post infection ( p < 0 . 0001 , ANOVA ) . Binding was reduced in viral - infected cells only by SP ( p < 0 . 05 ) . No shift was seen in mock - infected cells due to addition of antibody . In viral - infected cells , a statistically significant shift was seen with p50 and cREL ( p < 0 . 05 ) , but not with p65 . In viral - infected inhibitor - treated cells only SP reduced binding ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Molecular Vision 2009 ; 15 : 2879 - 2889 < http : / / www . molvis . org / molvis / v15 / a304 > © 2009 Molecular Vision 2883 promoter , a binding / shift was seen with p50 and cREL ( p < 0 . 05 ) , but not with p65 ( p > 0 . 05 ) , suggesting that NFκB p65 does not participate in MCP - 1 transcription . In light of our in vivo data showing that KC , an IL - 8 homolog , is the first chemokine to be induced upon adenoviral - infection , and that MCP - 1 expression is delayed , these results indicate that in adenoviral infection , IL - 8 is transactivated by NFκB p65 / p65 homodimers and / or NFκB p65 / p50 heterodimers , while MCP - 1 gene expression is delayed and uses predominantly cREL and NFκB p50 . Cellular localization of NFκB subunits in adenoviral infection : NFκB and IκB shuttle continually between the cytoplasm and nucleus in steady state conditions , resulting in a basal level of NFκB activity [ 36 ] . We previously demonstrated increased nuclear localization of NFκB p65 upon adenoviral infection [ 7 ] . Now , using confocal microscopy , we confirmed increased nuclear localization of Figure 3 . Nuclear translocation of NFκB subunits upon viral infection . Confocal microscopy shows cellular localization of NFκB subunits . A : Cytoplasmic localization of NFκB p65 ( yellow ) is compared to nuclei ( blue , DAPI stain ) in mock - infected keratocytes ( M ) . Adenoviral - infected ( V ) keratocytes demonstrate nuclear localization of NFκB p65 and p50 . Nuclear translocation of NFκB p65 was reduced in the presence of inhibitors of p38 ( SB ) and ERK ( PD ) . The nuclear localization of both NFκB p65 and p50 was partially reduced upon pretreatment with an inhibitor of JNK ( SP ) and completely blocked with an inhibitor of Src ( PP2 ) . Isotype control is shown ( Ctrl ) . Viral infection also induced nuclear translocation of cREL ( B ) , while all signaling inhibitors tested reduced the nuclear translocation of cREL .

MAPK inhibitors partially impaired the nuclear localization of NFκB p65 , p50 , and cREL in viral - infected cells ( Figure 3A ) . Interestingly , SP600125 had less inhibitory effect on nuclear localization compared to other MAPK inhibitors , indicating that the JNK pathway does not mediate NFκB p65 activation . The Src inhibitor PP2 completely suppressed NFκB p65 and p50 nuclear translocation ( Figure 3A ) , suggesting a broad upstream role of Src in these pathways , while downstream MAPKs collaborate in the activation and translocation of NFκB . Confocal microscopy was also performed for the cREL subunit of NFκB . In these experiments , cREL and p65 were both translocated into the nucleus upon viral infection ( Figure 3B ) as compared to mock - treated cells ( Figure 3B ) . Pretreatment with signaling inhibitors of Src and MAPK reduced both p65 and cREL nuclear translocation , except for SP600125 ( Figure 3B ) . Specific NFκB subunits bind to the IL - 8 and MCP - 1 promoters upon viral infection in a time - dependent fashion : The presence of NFκB in the nucleus is not by itself a direct indication of transcriptional activity [ 36 ] . To confirm whether translocated NFκB p65 is transcriptionally active upon viral infection , we analyzed the binding of NFκB p65 and p50 to the IL - 8 or MCP - 1 promoter using a ChIP technique . Binding of both NFκB p65 and p50 on the IL - 8 promoter was considerably increased with adenoviral infection , well above the basal levels seen in mock - treated cells at 1 and 4 h post infection ( Figure 4A ) . As expected , inhibitors of Src and MAPKs dramatically reduced NFκB p65 and p50 binding . Anti - mouse serum control demonstrated the specificity of NFκB p65 and p50 antibody binding , as the control antibodies did not pull down IL - 8 DNA . IL - 8 promoter binding appeared similar at 1 and 4 h post infection . cREL binding to the IL - 8 promoter was negligible . Interestingly , no NFκB p65 was bound to the MCP - 1 promoter at 1 or 4 h post infection ( Figure 4B ) . NFκB p50 binding to the MCP - 1 promoter was equivalent at both 1 and 4 h after infection and was unaffected by MAPK inhibitors . A marginal increase in cREL binding to the MCP - 1 promoter was apparent at 1 h post infection , increasing dramatically at 4 h after infection . cREL binding at 4 h was reduced by all inhibitors utilized . Figure 4 . Analysis of promoter binding activity by NFκB subunits using ChIP assay . ChIP was performed with 200 μg lysate . A : Binding of NFκB p65 and p50 was observed at both 1 and 4 h post infection on the IL - 8 promoter ( left and right panels , respectively ) . A negligible amount of cREL bound to the IL - 8 promoter at 1 and 4 h . Inhibitor pretreatment reduced the binding of p65 , p50 , and cREL on the IL - 8 promoter at both time points post infection . For ChIP , 5 % of the total lysate was used as a loading control ( Load ) to show that an equivalent amount of extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation . Isotype control is shown ( Ctrl ) . B : p 65 binding to the MCP - 1 promoter was not observed at 1 or 4 h post infection . p 50 bound but showed no apparent change across the pretreatment groups at 1 or 4 h . Binding of cREL on the MCP - 1 promoter was apparent at 1 h but increased dramatically at 4 h post infection .

We used NFκB p65 - specific or scrambled control siRNA for these experiments . Figure 5A shows successful knockdown of NFκB p65 expression in keratocytes to 70 – 80 % in repeat experiments ( data not shown ) . When co - transfected with IL - 8 luciferase construct , NFκB p65 specific siRNA reduced IL - 8 luciferase activity to basal levels at all time points tested post infection ( Figure 5B , p < 0 . 0001 ) , while scrambled control siRNA demonstrated no such effect . Interestingly , MCP - 1 ELISA performed on supernatants from the same experiments ( Figure 5C ) showed no reduction in MCP - 1 protein expression in p65 siRNA treated cells , indicating that NFκB p65 is dispensable for MCP - 1 induction . MCP - 1 expression became significantly elevated in viral - infected cells only at 4 h post infection ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . siRNA against p65 did not significantly alter MCP - 1 protein expression in viral - infected cells at any time post infection . DISCUSSION The observed difference in the kinetics of IL - 8 and MCP - 1 chemokine expression after adenoviral infection , in the studies herein , correlates well with the pattern of leukocyte infiltration in vivo [ 32 ] , but in general , the mechanisms for differential expression of proinflammatory cytokines in infection are not well understood . The stepwise order and timely expression of various inflammatory mediators seem to be preset as a part of a master gene activation program . For example , the consistent differential in time between the expression of interferon gamma and IL - 17 during active experimental autoimmune encephalitis in DA rats suggests different roles for these cytokines in the pathogenesis of the disease [ 37 ] . Our data is consistent with the idea that the kinetics of cytokine expression in inflammation are due in large part to the interplay between elements that regulate transcriptional induction , transcriptional repression , and perhaps mRNA stability [ 3 ] . Two decades after the initial discovery of NFκB , new functions for this ubiquitous transcription factor family continue to emerge . Recent progress in understanding how the immune system senses and responds to pathogens has drawn new attention to NFκB as a key effector of inflammatory responses to infection [ 27 ] . Its multiple actions , redundancy in function , and cell specificity have made building a picture of the molecular mechanisms by which NFκB activates cytokine genes in infection a complex undertaking . Viruses that have been previously shown to activate NFκB include human immunodeficiency virus [ 38 ] , hepatitis B virus [ 39 ] , hepatitis C virus [ 40 , 41 ] , Epstein Barr virus [ 42 ] , herpes simplex virus [ 43 ] , and influenza virus [ 44 ] . The K13 protein of human herpes virus - 8 was shown to mediate IL - 8 via NFκB p65 , p50 and cREL [ 10 ] . Most prior studies of the influence of adenoviral infection on NFκB activation used either recombinant adenoviruses [ 45 ] , adenovirus vectors [ 46 , 47 ] , or isolated adenovirus proteins [ 7 , 45 , 48 , 49 ] . The possible roles of NFκB binding kinetics and subunit specificity in chemokine expression by primary keratocytes Figure 5 . NFκB p65 is indispensable for IL - 8 but dispensable for MCP - 1 induction . A : A representative western blot showed knockdown of NFκB p65 . B : A luciferase assay demonstrates reduction of IL - 8 transcription to mock levels at all times post infection by p65 siRNA treatment ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . C : MCP - 1 ELISA revealed statistically increased expression at 4 h post infection ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , but transfected siRNA specific to p65 did not alter MCP - 1 expression , as compared to scrambled control siRNA .

Many previous reports demonstrate IL - 8 induction through various MAPK pathways converging on NFκB [ 11 , 41 ] , and binding of NFκB p65 to the IL - 8 promoter [ 7 , 50 - 53 ] . In our studies , adenoviral - infected cells showed increased nuclear translocation and IL - 8 promoter binding for NFκB p65 and p50 . Interestingly , we demonstrated by confocal microscopy , EMSA , and western blot that the JNK inhibitor ( SP600125 ) had a minimal effect on NFκB p65 and p50 binding to IL - 8 promoter . These data correlate with our earlier reports showing that inhibition of JNK activity in adenoviral - infected cells did not reduce IL - 8 expression [ 34 ] or inhibit NFκB p65 translocation to the nucleus [ 7 ] . However , the ChIP data did appear to show an effect of SP600125 on p65 . Also , cREL binding to IL - 8 promoter by ChIP assay was negligible , but our supershift assay with cREL on the IL - 8 promoter was significant . Further studies will be necessary to resolve these apparent discrepancies . Our confocal microscopy data demonstrated increased nuclear translocation of NFκB p65 , cREL , and p50 in adenoviral - infected cells , whereas no such translocation was observed in mock - treated cells . By confocal microscopy , inhibitors to various MAPKs reduced but did not completely inhibit NFκB subunit translocation to the nucleus , suggesting that NFκB nuclear translocation represents a summation of upstream activity by numerous kinases . Our earlier studies demonstrated that inhibition of Src fully blocked activation of p38 MAPK , ERK , and JNK ( 32 , 35 , and 52 ) , suggesting that Src kinases are linearly upstream to all 3 MAPKs . By confocal microscopy , inhibition of Src also effectively blocked NFκB nuclear translocation . Although IL - 8 is one of the best - studied chemokines in host – pathogen interactions , the specific signaling and molecular mechanism underlying the kinetics of its induction remain to be fully elucidated . IL - 8 contributes to the chemotaxis of neutrophils but also other leukocytes [ 11 - 13 ] , and has become a paradigm chemokine for translational studies of anti - chemokine therapy . Monoclonal antibody to IL - 8 was recently utilized successfully as a treatment for localized pustular psoriasis [ 54 ] . Our data clearly show that NFκB p65 is critical for IL - 8 expression , as knockdown of p65 reduced IL - 8 luciferase activity to mock levels at multiple time points post infection . Reduced p65 did not inhibit expression of MCP - 1 , suggesting again that MCP - 1 expression is not NFκB p65 dependent . We suggest that NFκB p65 and cREL play a role in the kinetics of IL - 8 and MCP - 1 gene regulation , respectively , in adenoviral - infected primary keratocytes . Further studies are needed to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying MCP - 1 induction and how other transcription factors such as Sp1 may regulate chemokine induction in adenoviral infection .
