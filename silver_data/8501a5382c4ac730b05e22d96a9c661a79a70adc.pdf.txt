INTRODUCTION Cholera toxin ( CT ) , produced by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae , is an activator of adenylyl cyclase in eukaryotic cells . The toxin consists of ﬁve identical binding subunits ( CTB ) and a single A - chain , which after proteolytic cleavage gives rise to the enzymatically active A 1 - peptide , which catalyses ADP - ribosylation of the a subunit of the heterotrimeric GTP - binding protein Gs ( Ganguly and Kaur , 1996 ) . This renders adenylyl cyclase constitutively active , thereby increasing the intracellular level of cAMP . The B - chains of the toxin pentamer bind speciﬁcally to the glycosphingolipid GM1 in the outer leaﬂet of the plasma membrane . The distribution pattern of GM1 in the plasma membrane is not clear . Visualized by CT , CTB or via biotin - labeling of GM1 , GM1 has been reported to be evenly distributed in the plasma membrane ( Kenworthy et al . , 2000 ) , but also to be concentrated in caveolae ( Möbius et al . , 1999 ; Parton , 1994 ; Montesano et al . , 1982 ) , specialized plasma membrane invaginations rich in the protein caveolin , cholesterol and glycolipids . GM1 has also been visualized in DIGs ( detergent - insoluble glycosphingolipid rich domains ) ( Möbius et al . , 1999 ) , membrane patches with a similar cholesterol and glycolipid composition as caveolae , and in clathrin - coated pits ( Möbius et al . , 1999 ; Montesano et al . , 1982 ; Parton , 1994 ) , although to a much lesser extent than in caveolae . It is generally accepted that intoxication of cells with CT requires endocytosis of the holotoxin before further intracellular transport and translocation to the cytosol . In certain cell types caveolae are reported to be involved in the internalization process ( Schnitzer et al . , 1996 ; Henley et al . , 1998 ; Montesano et al . , 1982 ; Tran et al . , 1987 ) . This has led to the notion that CT is a good marker for caveolae - mediated endocytosis . By using 125 I - or gold - labeled CT it has been reported that CT clusters in caveolae at low temperature and , after raising the incubation temperature , labeled CT is visualized in non - coated vesicles or multivesicular bodies ( Schnitzer et al . , 1996 ; Montesano et al . , 1982 ; Tran et al . , 1987 ) . In addition , it has been reported that 125 I - CT labeled vesicles are released from isolated membranes in a cell - free system after raising the temperature ( Gilbert et al . , 1999 ) . However , clustering of CT in caveolae is no direct evidence that the toxin is taken in via these structures . The molecules might be trapped in the invaginations , facilitating detection . Conversely , the fact that little CT is detected in clathrin - coated pits ( Parton , 1994 ; Montesano et al . , 1982 ) does not exclude the possibility that the toxin is rapidly endocytosed via these structures , and is therefore more difficult to visualize . It should be noted that clathrin - coated pits have a half - life of only 1 minute at the cell surface ( Marsh and McMahon , 1999 ) . In fact , two recent studies have indicated partial involvement of clathrin - dependent endocytosis in the uptake of CT in COS - 7 cells ( Nichols et al . , 2001 ) and in hippocampal neurons ( Shogomori and Futerman , 2001 ) . In addition , CT is internalized in cells without caveolae . For example , lymphocytes lack detectable levels of caveolin - 1 and do not 3737 The mechanism of cholera toxin ( CT ) internalization has been investigated using Caco - 2 cells transfected with caveolin to induce formation of caveolae , HeLa cells with inducible synthesis of mutant dynamin ( K44A ) and BHK cells in which antisense mRNA to clathrin heavy chain can be induced . Here we show that endocytosis and the ability of CT to increase the level of cAMP were unaltered in caveolin - transfected cells grown either in a non - polarized or polarized manner . Treatment of Caco - 2 cells with ﬁlipin reduced CT - uptake by less than 20 % , suggesting that caveolae do not play a major role in the uptake . Extraction of cholesterol by methyl - b - cyclodextrin , which removes caveolae and inhibits uptake from clathrin - coated pits , gave 30 - 40 % reduction of CT - endocytosis . Also , CT - uptake in HeLa K44A cells was reduced by 50 - 70 % after induction of mutant dynamin , which inhibits both caveolae - and clathrin - dependent endocytosis . These cells contain few caveolae , and nystatin and ﬁlipin had no effect on CT - uptake , indicating major involvement of clathrin - coated pits in CT - internalization . Similarly , in BHK cells , where clathrin - dependent endocytosis is blocked by induction of antisense clathrin heavy chain , the CT - uptake was reduced by 50 % in induced cells . In conclusion , a large fraction of CT can be endocytosed by clathrin - dependent as well as by caveolae - and clathrin - independent endocytosis in different cell types .

DIGs have been proposed to act as the vehicle for CT entry in Jurkat T lymphoma cells ( Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ) , but there are no data indicating how DIGs might be internalized . Whether the uptake resembles what happens with caveolae is not at all obvious , since caveolin is not present . In addition to clathrin - dependent endocytosis and possible uptake by caveolae , there are also clathrin - and caveolae - independent forms of endocytosis ( Lamaze and Schmid , 1995 ; Sandvig and van Deurs , 1994 ; van Deurs et al . , 1989 ; Lamaze , 2001 ) , and both dynamin - dependent and - independent forms have been described . These mechanisms might contribute to the internalization of CT . Further quantitative studies on the endocytic mechanisms of CT are clearly needed to fully understand how this protein toxin is internalized . In the present study we have investigated the importance of different endocytic mechanisms for CT uptake in a CaCo - 2 cell line transfected with caveolin - 1 ( Vogel et al . , 1998 ) , in which caveolae are expressed basolaterally after transfection . Both the endocytosis and the effect of the toxin were investigated after transfection , and since caveolin has been shown to interact directly with GM1 ( Fra et al . , 1995a ) , also the polarized distribution of GM1 in the cells was studied . The role of dynamin in CT - uptake was investigated using the HeLa K44A cell line which , in an inducible manner , produce mutant dynamin ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) . Finally , the involvement of clathrin - coated pits in CT - internalization was speciﬁcally investigated using a BHK cell line that can be induced to produce antisense clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) , with a subsequent block in clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Llorente et al . , 2001 ; Iversen et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , the uptake of CT by different endocytic mechanisms are not affected to the same extent by actin depolymerization and by tyrosine kinase inhibition . Together , the experiments rule out that CT is exclusively internalized via caveolae or glycosphingolipid - rich domains . Clathrin - dependent and caveolae - and clathrin - independent endocytosis are major pathways involved in the uptake of CT in the cell types studied . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Cholera toxin was purchased from Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA . Hepes , BSA , MESNa ( 2 - mercaptoethanesulfonic acid , sodium salt ) , tetracycline , methyl - b - cyclodextrin , IBMX , cytochalasin D , genistein , nystatin and ﬁlipin III were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co . , St Louis , MO . Geniticin was obtained from Life Technologies Inc . , Gaithersburg , MD . [ 3 H ] - labeled arachidonic acid ( AA ) and Na 125 I were obtained from NEN Life Science Products , Boston , MA . Transferrin was labeled with 125 I as described ( Fraker and Speck , 1978 ) . Cells CaCo - 2 cells transfected with caveolin - 1 ( clone 33 - 2 ) and control vector ( clone 12 - 2 ) ( Vogel et al . , 1998 ) were grown in DMEM ( Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s MEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , nonessential amino acids , 2 mM L - glutamine , 100 units / ml penicillin , 100 m g / ml streptomycin and 0 . 65 mg / ml geneticin . The cells were seeded out on Transwell ﬁlters ( Costar ; pore size 0 . 4 m m , diameter 12 mm ) 4 days prior to experiments at a density of 1 . 6 · 10 5 cells / ﬁlter . The transepithelial resistance of the monolayer was measured with a Millicell - ERS equipment ( Millipore Corporation , Bedford , MA ) at the beginning of the experiments . Filters with a transepithelial resistance higher than 300 W cm 2 were used . In the experiments , 0 . 25 ml of Hepes buffered MEM medium was added to the apical side and 0 . 5 ml was added to the basolateral side . HeLa K44A mutant dynamin cells ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS , 2 mM L - glutamine , 100 units / ml penicillin , 100 m g / ml streptomycin , 0 . 2 m g / ml puromycin , 0 . 4 mg / ml geneticin and 1 m g / ml tetracycline . Two days prior to experiments the cells were seeded with and without tetracycline in 24 - well plates at a density of 2 · 10 4 cells / well . BHK21 - tTA cells transfected with antisense CHC ( Llorente et al . , 2001 ; Iversen et al . , 2001 ) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 7 . 5 % FCS , 2 mM L - glutamine , 100 units / ml penicillin , 100 m g / ml streptomycin , 1 m g / ml puromycin , 0 . 2 mg / ml geneticin and 2 m g / ml tetracycline . Two days prior to experiments the cells were seeded with and without tetracycline in 24 - well plates at a density of 2 · 10 4 cells / well . Measurement of endocytosis of TAG - labeled CT and 125 I - labeled transferrin Endocytosis of CT was performed essentially as previously described ( Skretting et al . , 1999 ) . Brieﬂy , CT was labeled with tris ( bipyridine ) - chelated ruthenium ( II ) ( TAG - label ) ( IGEN Inc . , Rockville , MD ) and biotinylated with the reducible ImmunoPure NHS - SS - Biotin ( Pierce ) . Biotinylation of CT has previously been used and does not inﬂuence the toxin molecule ( Lencer et al . , 1995 ) . The cells were washed once with Hepes medium and incubated with TAG - and biotin - labeled CT ( 9 - 12 . 5 ng / ml ) in Hepes buffered MEM medium in the presence of BSA ( 2 mg / ml ) for 2 - 20 minutes at 37 (cid:176) C . Half of the wells were then treated with 0 . 1 M MESNa at 0 (cid:176) C for 1 hour to reduce the SS - linked biotin in cell surface - bound toxin ( Smythe et al . , 1992 ) . Only toxin that is TAG - labeled and still biotinylated is detected in the cell lysate using streptavidin beads ( Dynal , Oslo , Norway ) and ORIGEN Analyzer ( IGEN Inc . ) . Cells treated with MESNa give the amount of endocytosed toxin , while untreated cells give the total amount of toxin associated with the cells . In this assay there is a background of 2 . 5 % after MESNA - treatment , which is subtracted from all endocytosis values given in this paper . The background is constant from 2 to 20 minutes of endocytosis and is similar in all the cells studied . The cells were preincubated with the various drugs for 30 minutes at the concentration stated in the ﬁgure legend , and then the endocytosis of CT was determined in the presence of the drug . Endocytosis of 125 I - transferrin was performed as previously described ( Rodal et al . , 1999 ) . Measurement of cAMP , arachidonic acid metabolite release and proliferation For the determination of cAMP , polarized CaCo - 2 cells were washed in Hepes medium , Hepes medium with IBMX ( 0 . 5 mM ) was added , and the cells were incubated at 37 (cid:176) C for 1 hour with CT ( 10 m g / ml ) added apically or basolaterally . The content of cAMP in the cells was measured by a cyclic AMP - [ 3 H ] assay system from Amersham Corp . , as previously described ( Sandvig et al . , 1994 ) . The generation of cAMP in response to cholera toxin was extremely low in both the HeLa K44A and the BHK antisense CHC cells used here . The release of arachidonic acid ( AA ) metabolites after incubation with CT was measured by preincubating CaCo - 2 cells grown in 24 - well plates with 0 . 25 m Ci / ml of [ 3 H ] - labeled AA for 24 hours , and then incubating the cells with 10 m g / ml CT for 1 hour after two washes with Hepes . Free cells were removed from the incubation medium by centrifugation , and the amount of [ 3 H ] - labeled material released into the medium was measured . For measurement of proliferation , CaCo - 2 cells were seeded out in 24 - well plates , and 1 and 10 m g / ml CT were added after 8 hours , 1 day or 2 days . After 3 days of incubation , the cells were washed in JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE 114 ( 20 ) 3739 Endocytosis of cholera toxin PBS and lysed with 0 . 1 M KOH . The amount of protein was measured using BCA Protein Assay Reagent ( Pierce ) . Electron microscopy BHK antisense CHC cells and HeLa K44A cells were incubated with a conjugate of CTB - chain coupled covalently to HRP ( Sigma type IV ) at 0 (cid:176) C to visualize binding of CT and at 37 (cid:176) C for endocytosis experiments . After 30 minutes of incubation with the conjugate ( 10 m g / ml ) , the cells were washed with PBS and ﬁxed with 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer , pH 7 . 2 , for 1 hour at room temperature . The cells were then washed with PBS ( 5 times ) before incubation with 0 . 5 m l / ml of a 30 % H 2 O 2 solution and 0 . 5 mg / ml diaminobenzidine in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature . The cells were then washed , scraped off the ﬂasks , pelleted , and post - ﬁxed with OsO 4 , contrasted en bloc with 1 % uranyl acetate , dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol , and embedded in Epon . Sections were contrasted with lead citrate and uranyl acetate , before examination in a Phillips CM 100 electron microscope ( Phillips , Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) . RESULTS Introduction of caveolae basolaterally in CaCo - 2 cells does not alter the endocytosis of CT To what extent caveolae represent dynamic structures in different cell types is not clear . We have therefore investigated the endocytic uptake of CT in a cell line without caveolae , and measured whether introduction of these specialized structures would alter the uptake of the toxin . As a model we chose a CaCo - 2 cell line in which caveolae are formed basolaterally after transfection with caveolin - 1 ( Vogel et al . , 1998 ) . Wild type CaCo - 2 cells and CaCo - 2 cells transfected with control plasmid ( clone 12 - 2 ) have nearly undetectable levels of caveolin - 1 and few , if any caveolae , whereas transfected cells ( clone 33 - 2 ) express high levels of caveolin - 1 , and caveolae are observed at the basolateral surface . To assess the endocytosis of CT in cells transfected with caveolin - 1 and control plasmid , TAG - and biotin - labeled CT was added apically or basolaterally to polarized CaCo - 2 cells grown on ﬁlters . As shown in Table 1 , the introduction of caveolae basolaterally does not alter the endocytosis of CT apically nor basolaterally . The uptake of CT was measured after a short time since longer incubations might be inﬂuenced by recycling , transcytosis or degradation of the toxin . It has previously been published that GM1 interacts directly with caveolin - 1 ( Fra et al . , 1995a ) . It was therefore an interesting question whether transfection of CaCo - 2 cells with caveolin - 1 and introduction of caveolae basolaterally could lead to an altered distribution of GM1 . To investigate this question , we measured the binding of TAG - and biotin - labeled CT to the apical and basolateral membrane of CaCo - 2 cells transfected with caveolin - 1 and control plasmid . There was no change in CT - binding neither apically nor basolaterally after transfection of the cells with caveolin - 1 and introduction of caveolae basolaterally ( data not shown ) . Biological activity of CT in CaCo - 2 cells transfected with caveolin - 1 is unchanged Although the endocytosis of CT in CaCo - 2 cells transfected with caveolin - 1 was unchanged , it could not be excluded that overexpression of caveolin - 1 might lead to altered intracellular transport and action of CT . We therefore measured the amount of cAMP generated when CT was added either apically or basolaterally to cells transfected with caveolin - 1 and control plasmid . As shown in Table 2 , transfection with caveolin - 1 did not increase the amount of cAMP generated in response to CT when the toxin is added either apically or basolaterally . Similar results were obtained also when the cells were incubated with lower amounts of CT ( 0 . 1 and 1 m g / ml ) before cAMP measurements ( data not shown ) . In addition to CT - induced activation of adenylyl cyclase , the toxin stimulates arachidonic acid ( AA ) metabolism in some cells . It is known that the toxin can activate phospholipase A 2 ( Burch et al . , 1988 ; Peterson et al . , 1999 ) , and thereby increase hydrolysis of AA from membrane phospholipids . To investigate whether the AA metabolism was altered after transfection of the CaCo - 2 cells with caveolin - 1 , the amount Time ( minutes ) 0 5 10 15 20 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 C T e ndo c y t o s i s ( % o f t o t a l ce ll - a ss o c i a t e d t ox i n ) Fig . 1 .

The amount of total cell - associated CT at 2 and 20 minutes was 0 . 11 and 0 . 38 ng / 40 , 000 cells , respectively . Equal amounts of CT were bound to non - induced and induced cells . Table 1 .

Then the cells were washed , and the incubation continued for 10 minutes at 37 (cid:176) C in the same medium . Bound and endocytosed toxin was quantiﬁed after 10 minutes of internalization at 37 (cid:176) C as described in Materials and Methods , and the results shown are the mean values±s . d . ( n = 4 ) . The amount of total cell - associated CT after 10 minutes of endocytosis from the apical or the basolateral side was approximately 9 and 12 pg / ﬁlter , respectively . 3740 of released [ 3 H ] - labeled AA - metabolites was measured after addition of CT to cells transfected with control plasmid and caveolin - 1 and preincubated with [ 3 H ] AA . The results revealed no signiﬁcant differences between control and caveolin - transfected cells . CT has also been found to have a proliferative effect on several cell types , an effect that is not mediated via the increasing cAMP concentration , but rather via increased levels of intracellular Ca 2 + ( Spiegel and Fishman , 1985 ; Okada et al . , 1982 ; Yamaoka and Imamura , 1998 ; Uhal et al . , 1998 ) . To investigate whether this effect of CT was altered after transfection of the CaCo - 2 cells with caveolin - 1 , the proliferation of the cells was measured after incubation with CT for 1 - 3 days . The results did not show signiﬁcant proliferative effect of CT on the control CaCo - 2 cells , and transfection with caveolin - 1 did not induce any proliferative effect ( data not shown ) . Cytochalasin D and nocodazole have no effect on the endocytosis of CT in CaCo - 2 cells transfected with caveolin - 1 It has previously been shown that the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules can be important for endocytic mechanisms . Both actin - depolymerizing drugs and the microtubule - disrupting drug nocodazole , have been reported to inhibit clathrin - dependent endocytosis in some cell types , but not in others ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ; Subtil and Dautry - Varsat , 1997 ; Fujimoto et al . , 2000 ) . To investigate whether the basolateral internalization of CT in CaCo - 2 cells is dependent on actin ﬁlaments or microtubules , and to test whether transfection with caveolin - 1 might induce a difference with respect to this requirement , we treated both control cells and caveolin - 1 - expressing cells with cytochalasin D and nocodazole before measuring CT - endocytosis .

Thus , there is no evidence for the involvement of either actin or microtubules in basolateral endocytosis of CT in these cells . Effects of ﬁlipin and M b CD on basolateral CT - endocytosis The drug ﬁlipin is known to bind cholesterol in the plasma membrane and impair the invagination of caveolae , thereby inhibiting caveolae internalization ( Rothberg et al . , 1990 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1994 ; Rothberg et al . , 1992 ) . Here , we have investigated the effect of ﬁlipin on CT - endocytosis on the basolateral side in both our control CaCo - 2 cells and in the caveolin - transfected cells . As shown in Table 3 , the basolateral endocytosis of CT was reduced by only 13 - 17 % after ﬁlipin treatment , and there was no signiﬁcant difference in CT - uptake between control and caveolin - transfected cells with respect to the effect of ﬁlipin . This supports the idea that CT is not endocytosed via the newly introduced caveolae in the transfected cells . Also , since treatment of the CaCo - 2 cells with ﬁlipin gave only a slight reduction in CT - uptake , we wanted to investigate whether M b CD , which extracts cholesterol from the membrane and inhibits both caveolae - and clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Rodal et al . , 1999 ; Ohtani et al . , 1989 ; Klein et al . , 1995 ; Subtil et al . , 1999 ) , would give a stronger reduction in CT - uptake . As shown in Table 3 , M b CD treatment of control and caveolin - 1 transfected cells resulted in a 30 - 40 % reduction of basolateral CT internalization . As with ﬁlipin treatment , there was little difference between the control and caveolin - transfected cells . Endocytosis of CT is reduced in HeLa cells expressing mutant dynamin CT has been visualized both in clathrin - coated pits and in caveolae , and vesicle formation from both types of structures has been reported to be dependent on the GTP - ase dynamin ( Oh et al . , 1998 ; Henley et al . , 1998 ) . Our quantiﬁcation of CT uptake in CaCo - 2 cells suggested that CT could enter cells by Fig . 4 . Electron micrographs of HeLa K44A cells incubated with a CTB - HRP conjugate . In A - D the cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 0 (cid:176) C before ﬁxation and processing for EM . The CTB - HRP conjugate labeling is shown on the cell surface and both in caveolae ( A , C ) and clathrin - coated pits ( B , D ) . Incubation of the cells with CTB - HRP for 30 minutes at 37 (cid:176) C also labels both caveolae ( E ) and clathrin - coated pits ( F ) , whereas the labeling of the non - specialized cell surface is strongly reduced . In G - J the cells were induced for mutant dynamin expression before incubation with CTB - HRP for 30 minutes at 37 (cid:176) C . Both caveolae ( G , I ) and particularly clathrin - coated pits , which were frequent ( two - to threefold increase compared with controls ) , were distinctly labeled ( H - J ) . Bar , 100 nm .

Bound and endocytosed CT was quantiﬁed as described in Materials and Methods . The results shown are the mean values±s . d . ( n = 4 - 6 ) . 3742 clathrin - and caveolae - independent endocytosis as well as by clathrin - dependent endocytosis . To investigate this question in more detail we chose HeLa K44A cells , which express mutant dynamin in an inducible manner , as a model . The K44A mutant of dynamin has impaired binding of GTP and is known to inhibit receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) , and the similar K44E mutant was found to inhibit caveolae budding in cells expressing caveolin - 1 ( Oh et al . , 1998 ) . The HeLa K44A cells have a very low level of caveolin - 1 and few distinguishable caveolae on the plasma membrane ( Skretting et al . , 1999 ) . Further , a possible uptake from the few caveolae that might be present should be inhibited by mutant dynamin . Thus , the CT - endocytosis obtained upon expression of mutant dynamin is likely to reﬂect the amount of CT taken up by clathrin - and caveolae - independent endocytosis . The HeLa K44A cells were incubated with TAG - and biotin - labeled CT after 2 days of induction of mutant dynamin . Fig . 1 shows the kinetics of CT endocytosis in cells with wild - type and mutant dynamin . Overexpression of mutant dynamin reduced the endocytosis of CT to 32 - 50 % of control cells , indicating that a relatively large fraction of CT can be taken up by a dynamin - independent process . Since neither nystatin nor ﬁlipin had any signiﬁcant effect on CT - endocytosis in these cells , the dynamin - dependent uptake most likely reﬂects clathrin - dependent endocytosis of CT . In cells incubated with and without tetracycline , uptake of CT in the presence of nystatin ( 25 m g / ml ) was 102±3 % and 101±6 % , respectively ( mean values ± s . d . , n = 4 ) . In the presence of ﬁlipin ( 5 m g / ml ) , corresponding numbers were 108±11 % and 108±11 % . The binding of CT to HeLa cells expressing mutant dynamin was unchanged ( data not shown ) . Uptake of CT in BHK cells with selective inhibition of clathrin - dependent endocytosis Since the investigations of HeLa cells with mutant dynamin indicated that a large fraction of CT is taken up from clathrin - coated pits , we further investigated the role of clathrin - coated pits in the internalization of CT by using BHK cells with inducible expression of antisense CHC . Expression of antisense CHC leads to non - functional clathrin - coated pits ( Llorente et al . , 2001 ; Iversen et al . , 2001 ) . To investigate the initial CT - uptake , the cells were induced for antisense CHC expression for two days , then TAG - and biotin - labeled CT was added and internalized for 2 to 20 minutes . The percent endocytosis of CT with increasing time is shown in Fig . 2A . Inhibition of clathrin - dependent endocytosis resulted in approximately 60 % reduction in CT - internalization throughout the time period studied . To verify that the clathrin - dependent endocytosis was inhibited after two days of induction of antisense CHC expression , the internalization of transferrin was measured in parallel with the CT experiments . As shown in Fig . 2B , the endocytosis of transferrin was reduced to background levels in induced cells . Clathrin is important for several intracellular transport routes ( Jackson , 1998 ; Le Borgne and Hoﬂack , 1998 ) in addition to uptake from the cell surface . Thus , the possibility existed that inhibition of CHC expression could affect the amount of GM1 at the cell surface . To assess whether the level of GM1 was altered after induction , the binding of CT was measured , and revealed a slight increase in CT - binding in induced cells ( data not shown ) . These cells have , like the HeLa K44A cells , relatively few caveolae on the plasma membrane ( Skretting et al . , 1999 ) , and ﬁlipin ( 5 m g / ml ) had little effect on CT endocytosis ( Fig . 3 ) . The possibility existed that CT was endocytosed via different mechanisms depending on surface occupancy and receptor crosslinking . This was investigated by measuring the CT - uptake at a high toxin concentration in both HeLa K44A and BHK antisense CHC cells . Endocytosis of TAG - and biotin labeled CT ( 9 ng / ml ) was measured with or without the simultaneous addition of 0 . 5 m g / ml unlabeled CT in both cell types . In BHK antisense CHC cells , the ratio of CT endocytosis at high to low toxin concentration for cells grown in the presence and absence of tetracycline was 1 . 0±0 . 2 and 0 . 9±0 . 1 , respectively ( mean values ± s . d . , n = 4 ) . In HeLa K44A cells , corresponding values were 1 . 1±0 . 1 and 0 . 9±0 . 1 . Thus , there was no difference in CT - JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE 114 ( 20 ) Fig . 5 .

Importance of actin disruption and tyrosine kinase inhibition for clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis in BHK antisense CHC cells To further characterize the internalization mechanisms employed by CT , we treated BHK antisense CHC cells with different inhibitors before measuring CT - uptake . Actin has been shown to be involved in endocytosis in several cell types ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ; Durrbach et al . , 1996 ; Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ; Sandvig and van Deurs , 1990 ) , although the effect of the different drugs interfering with actin polymerization seems to be dependent on the cell line and also the experimental protocol . In this study , BHK antisense CHC cells were treated with cytochalasin D ( 10 m g / ml ) before endocytosis of CT in both non - induced and induced cells . The results showed a 22 % reduction in endocytosis of CT in non - induced cells , while the induced cells were inhibited by 44 % ( Fig . 3 ) , indicating that actin is more involved in the clathrin - independent uptake of CT than in the clathrin - dependent uptake of the toxin . The mechanisms behind uptake of CT by different endocytic processes are not known , but somehow phosphorylation of membrane components might be involved ( Friant et al . , 2000 ; Lamaze et al . , 1993 ) . Interestingly , as shown in Fig . 3 , when BHK antisense CHC cells were incubated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein ( 100 m g / ml ) , the uptake of CT was reduced by 35 % in non - induced control cells , while the uptake was unaltered in induced cells . This indicates that tyrosine kinase activity is selectively involved in clathrin - dependent uptake of CT , whereas it does not seem to play a role in the clathrin - independent uptake of CT . Labeling of membrane domains and endocytic vesicles in HeLa K44A and BHK antisense CHC cells with a CTB - HRP conjugate To study , at the ultrastructural level , the ability of CT to label various membrane domains in HeLa K44A and BHK antisense CHC cells , these cells were incubated with a CTB - HRP conjugate at 0 (cid:176) C and 37 (cid:176) C and analyzed by EM . The CT - labeling of HeLa K44A cells is shown in Fig . 4 . After 30 minutes incubation at 0 (cid:176) C , the CT - conjugate strongly labeled the entire cell surface , including caveolae ( Fig . 4A , C ) and clathrin - coated pits ( Fig . 4B , D ) . After 30 minutes of incubation at 37 (cid:176) C , the labeling of the cell surface was signiﬁcantly reduced owing to internalization ; however , the toxin conjugate could still be found in both caveolae ( Fig . 4E ) and clathrin - coated pits ( Fig . 4F ) . Also , when dynamin - mediated endocytosis was inhibited by expression of mutant dynamin , the surface labeling was reduced due to internalization after incubation at 37 (cid:176) C . Moreover , both caveolae ( Fig . 4G , I ) and particularly clathrin - coated pits ( Fig . 4H - J ) , were distinctly labeled . In addition , there was a two - to threefold increase in the number of clathrin - coated pits on the cell surface compared with numbers in non - induced control cells . Fig . 5 shows electron micrographs of CTB - HRP - treated BHK cells with inducible expression of antisense CHC . As for the HeLa K44A Fig . 6 .

The CTB - HRP labeling was seen in an endosome ( En ) and surrounding tubulo - vesicular structures . In B , C , BHK antisense CHC cells were similarly incubated with CTB - HRP conjugate for 30 minutes at 37 (cid:176) C . Labeling was seen in an endosome ( En ) and surrounding tubulo - vesicular structures ( B ) as well as in a cistern ( arrow ) of a Golgi complex ( Go ) ( C ) .

However , as for the HeLa cells , the toxin conjugate could still be found in both caveolae ( Fig . 5C ) and clathrin - coated pits ( Fig . 5D ) . Also , after inhibition of clathrin - dependent endocytosis by expression of antisense CHC , the toxin conjugate was distinctly present in caveolae ( Fig . 5E ) and particularly in clathrin - coated pits ( Fig . 5F ) , which were frequent ( two - to ﬁvefold increase compared with non - induced cells ) . Fig . 6 shows electron micrographs of internalized CTB - HRP after 30 minutes of endocytosis at 37 (cid:176) C in HeLa K44A ( Fig . 6A ) and BHK antisense CHC cells ( Fig . 6B , C ) . CTB - HRP could be seen in endosomes and surrounding tubulo - vesicular structures even after expression of mutant dynamin ( Fig . 6A ) or antisense CHC ( Fig . 6B ) . Furthermore , CTB - HRP could be visualized in the Golgi apparatus ( Fig . 6C ) after expression of antisense CHC . DISCUSSION In this study we have investigated pathways for the internalization of CT in three different cell types . We show that both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytosis , which is caveolae - and dynamin - independent , constitute major routes for CT - uptake in the cell types studied . Overexpression of caveolin - 1 has previously been shown to induce formation of caveolae in several cell types ( Engelman et al . , 1997 ; Fra et al . , 1995b ; Hatanaka et al . , 1998 ) . CaCo - 2 cells express undetectable levels of caveolin - 1 and show few , if any invaginated caveolae on the plasma membrane , while transfection with caveolin - 1 induces formation of caveolae that localizes preferentially to the basolateral surface ( Vogel et al . , 1998 ) , like caveolae normally present in MDCK cells ( Mora et al . , 1999 ) . Since internalization of CT has previously been reported to be mediated by caveolae , and CT is often regarded as a marker for this endocytic mechanism , it was of interest to investigate whether introduction of caveolae would alter the endocytosis of CT or the ability of the toxin to increase the amount of cAMP in the CaCo - 2 cells . As shown here , formation of caveolae neither increased the uptake of CT nor the effect of the toxin , suggesting that CT is not endocytosed via the newly formed caveolae to any signiﬁcant extent . Treatment of both control - and caveolin - 1 - transfected CaCo - 2 cells with the cholesterol - binding drug ﬁlipin ( Rothberg et al . , 1990 ; Rothberg et al . , 1992 ) resulted in only a slight reduction in CT - uptake , indicating that neither caveolae nor DIGs , which have been proposed to be involved in CT - uptake in cells without caveolae ( Fra et al . , 1994 ; Fra et al . , 1995b ; Harder and Simons , 1997 ) , are of any major importance for CT - uptake in these cells . By contrast , treatment of the control CaCo - 2 cells with M b CD , which not only removes caveolae , but also inhibits clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Klein et al . , 1995 ; Ohtani et al . , 1989 ; Rodal et al . , 1999 ; Subtil et al . , 1999 ) , resulted in a 30 - 40 % reduction in CT - uptake , suggesting that clathrin - dependent endocytosis is involved in CT - uptake in these cells . The fact that M b CD extracts cholesterol from the plasma membrane whereas ﬁlipin forms a complex with the lipid in the membrane might be the reason for the lack of effect of ﬁlipin on clathrin - dependent endocytosis . The results shown here are apparently not in agreement with previously published results ( Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ) , where CT seemed to be taken in mainly by caveolae or caveolae - like domains in CaCo - 2 cells , since ﬁlipin - treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction ( 58 % ) of CT - uptake . The apparent discrepancy might be due to methodological differences . In this study we have used TAG - and biotin - SS - labeled CT to differentiate between truly pinched off endocytic vesicles and surface - connected structures . Labeled toxin molecules on the plasma membrane that are clustered in invaginations , even with narrow necks , become undetectable in our assay after treatment with the reducing agent MESNa . Surface connections of invaginated membrane are in some cases so narrow that the membrane - bound molecules in the invagination may not be reached by antibodies ( Smythe et al . , 1992 ) . The principle of different neck openings has in fact previously been used to determine the different steps in budding of clathrin - coated pits ( Smythe et al . , 1992 ; van der Bliek et al . , 1993 ) . Narrowing of the neck opening results in reduced antibody detection of transferrin , but unaltered reduction of a biotin - SS - label on transferrin . Only complete budding of the coated pit prevents reduction of the SS - biotin . The reported caveolae - mediated endocytosis of CT has been measured as loss of surface - associated CT detectable by an anti - CT - A 1 antibody ( Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ) . One might speculate that CT is clustered in caveolae with different diameters in the neck openings . This could exclude the anti - CT - A 1 antibody from some of the caveolae , and the results would be interpreted as endocytosis of CT , although no budding of caveolae had occurred . Treatment with ﬁlipin might somehow alter the diameter of the openings , leaving the caveolae more open and susceptible to antibody - detection , which in turn would indicate a reduction in CT - uptake . The apparent discrepancy in results could also be explained by cell differences . CaCo - 2 cells grown in different laboratories vary , and moreover , the reported studies of CT were performed on non - polarized CaCo - 2 cells , while in this paper we use polarized cells grown on ﬁlters . Several important changes occur in the cells during the polarization process ( Massey - Harroche , 2000 ) , changes that might explain the apparent discrepancy . Although CT - uptake in the non - polarized CaCo - 2 cells was reported to occur via caveolae and caveolae - like domains ( Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ) , the role of dynamin in the uptake was not investigated . Whether clathrin - independent endocytosis occurs independently of dynamin , might be used to differentiate between mechanistically different processes . Finally , the CaCo - 2 cells ( Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ) were suggested to have caveolae on the plasma membrane based on the fact that the cells express small amounts of caveolin - 1 . However , the structures were not visualized by electron microscopy and there might be a threshold value of caveolin - 1 that determines the generation of functional caveolae . Consequently , the uptake of CT in these cells might be mediated via other internalization mechanisms . It was an interesting question whether transfection of the CaCo - 2 cells with caveolin - 1 would lead to an altered distribution of GM1 , since a direct interaction between caveolin - 1 and GM1 has been reported ( Fra et al . , 1995a ) . Caveolin is found along several transport routes ( Scheiffele JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE 114 ( 20 ) 3745 Endocytosis of cholera toxin et al . , 1998 ; Smart et al . , 1996 ) , thus interaction of the overexpressed caveolin with GM1 could alter the intracellular transport of the glycosphingolipid . Furthermore , caveolin binds directly to cholesterol , which is important for regulation of intracellular transport ( Smart et al . , 1996 ) . However , the results showed that overexpression of caveolin - 1 in the CaCo - 2 cells did not alter the distribution of GM1 or the effects of CT . Inhibition of actin polymerization with cytochalasin D has been shown to inhibit receptor - mediated and ﬂuid - phase endocytosis at the apical , but not the basolateral side of polarized MDCK cells ( Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ) and CaCo - 2 cells ( Jackman et al . , 1994 ) . The importance of cytoskeletal elements in CT - uptake is less clear . The results presented here suggest that neither actin nor microtubules are required for basolateral endocytosis of CT in polarized CaCo - 2 cells , regardless of the presence of caveolae . This ﬁnding is in accordance with data from other cell types studied ( Jackman et al . , 1994 ; Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ; Schapiro et al . , 1998 ) . To further elucidate the role of dynamin and clathrin in the uptake of CT we have used two different cell lines , HeLa K44A , which can express dominant negative dynamin , and BHK , which can express antisense CHC upon induction . It has recently been reported that the GTPase dynamin , known to mediate the scission of clathrin - coated pits , is also involved in the budding of caveolae ( Oh et al . , 1998 ; Henley et al . , 1998 ) . HeLa K44A mutant dynamin cells have relatively few caveolae on the plasma membrane ( Skretting et al . , 1999 ) but , as shown here , still endocytose signiﬁcant amounts of CT . The results show a marked reduction in CT - uptake when mutant dynamin was expressed , implying the involvement of dynamin - dependent pathways in CT - uptake . Owing to the fact that these cells express few caveolae on the plasma membrane , the inhibitory effect observed upon overexpression of mutant dynamin most likely reﬂects the involvement of clathrin - coated pits in the CT - uptake . This notion is supported by the ﬁnding that neither nystatin nor ﬁlipin had any effect on the uptake of CT in K44A cells , and is in agreement with recent reports indicating that clathrin - dependent endocytosis is involved in the uptake of CT in neurons ( Shogomori and Futerman , 2001 ) and in the uptake of CT - B in COS - 7 cells transiently transfected with an eps 15 mutant ( Nichols et al . , 2001 ) . Remarkably , a relatively large fraction ( 30 - 50 % ) of the CT was taken in via dynamin - independent pathways . The existence of dynamin - independent endocytosis in these cells has previously been observed using the plant toxin ricin ( Llorente et al . , 1998 ) , the GPI - linked diphteria toxin receptor ( Skretting et al . , 1999 ) and by studies of ﬂuid uptake ( Damke et al . , 1995 ) . The involvement of clathrin - coated pits in CT - uptake was documented even more directly using BHK antisense CHC cells . Clathrin - dependent endocytosis was essentially abrogated after two days induction of antisense CHC in these cells , as shown by complete inhibition of transferrin - uptake . This resulted in approximately 60 % reduction in CT - uptake throughout the time period , clearly implying clathrin - coated pits in rapid CT - uptake in these cells , but also other , clathrin - independent , mechanisms since the inhibition was not complete . In addition , there was no evidence in these cells of involvement of caveolae or DIGs in CT - uptake , since ﬁlipin - treatment gave only a slight reduction in CT - uptake ( Fig . 3 ) . Electron micrographs of HeLa K44A cells and BHK antisense CHC cells treated with a CTB - HRP conjugate at 0 (cid:176) C show a strong labeling of the entire cell surface , including clathrin - coated pits and the relatively few caveolae present . This distribution of CT supports the notion that different endocytic mechanisms can be involved in uptake of CT . However , as mentioned above , the visualization of a ligand in one type of membrane invagination cannot be used to evaluate the role of this structure in the uptake . Importantly , the EM studies support the biochemical data showing that CT is internalized even when the dominant negative mutant of dynamin and antisense CHC are expressed . Inhibition of clathrin - dependent endocytosis in both K44A mutant dynamin cells and in BHK antisense CHC cells leads to increased surface - binding of transferrin ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) ( data not shown ) . This is as expected since transferrin - receptors are aggregated in coated pits even in the absence of ligand , and the endocytic uptake seems to be inhibited without any concomitant effect on recycling . By contrast , there was no signiﬁcant increase in binding of CT , suggesting that the GM1 are not preclustered in coated pits . The efficient uptake of CT by clathrin - dependent endocytosis suggests that there might be a toxin - induced translocation of receptors to clathrin - coated pits . A similar translocation to clathrin - coated pits has previously been shown for another glycolipid - binding toxin , Shiga toxin ( Sandvig and van Deurs , 1996 ) . It is not known how these toxins enter clathrin - coated pits , but there might be interactions with proteins entering by this route . The fact that the tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitor genistein counteracts CT uptake from clathrin - coated pits suggests involvement of phosphorylation . Interestingly , Shiga toxin has been found to activate tyrosine kinases ( Katagiri et al . , 1999 ; Mori et al . , 2000 ) . In conclusion , our results demonstrate that CT in several cell types are endocytosed by different endocytic mechanisms , both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent mechanisms that do not require dynamin , and that caveolae , although they contain GM1 , may not necessarily be mobile structures actively involved in endocytosis of CT .
