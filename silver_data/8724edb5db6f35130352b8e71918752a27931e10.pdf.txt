Methods : We used the largest contact tracing data in China thus far to estimate the mean contacts over time by age groups and contact settings . We used bootstrap with replacement to quantify the uncertainty of contact matrixes . The Pearson correlation was performed to demonstrate the number of contacts over time in relation to the evolution of restrictions . In addition , we analyzed the index cases with a high number of contacts and index cases that produced a high number of secondary cases . Results : Rapidly adapted PHSMs can reduce the mean contact rates in public places while increasing the mean contact rates within households . The mean contact rates were 11 . 81 ( 95 % conﬁdence interval , 11 . 61 - 12 . 01 ) for asymptomatic ( at the time of investigation ) cases and 6 . 70 ( 95 % conﬁdence interval , 6 . 54 - 6 . 87 ) for symptomatic cases . The percentage of asymptomatic cases ( at the time of investigation ) meeting > 50 close contacts make up more than 65 % of the overall cases . The percentage of asymptomatic cases producing > 10 secondary cases account for more than 80 % of the overall cases . Conclusion : PHSMs may increase the contacts within the household , necessitating the need for pertinent prevention strategies at home . Asymptomatic cases can contribute signiﬁcantly to Omicron transmission . By making asymptomatic people aware that they are already contagious , hence limiting their social con - tacts , it is possible to lower the transmission risk . © 2023 The Author ( s ) .

We estimated the mean number of contacts and their evolution in the ﬁrst week before the epidemic curve reached its peak , during which , the government’s rapid response issued con - tainment orders . In addition , we analyzed all the conﬁrmed cases connected to close contacts and compared the asymptomatic and symptomatic cases from varied perspectives . This study aimed to provide differentiated parameters for infectious disease modeling and add information about public health and social measures . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . ijid . 2023 . 03 . 025 1201 - 9712 / © 2023 The Author ( s ) .

International Journal of Infectious Diseases 131 ( 2023 ) 46 – 49 Figure 1 . Mean contacts by settings and by age group over time in Quanzhou City , China during an Omicron outbreak . The uncertainty of mean contacts was calculated using bootstrap with replacement on the original contact tracing dataset . We assigned weights based on the Quanzhou population stratiﬁed by age . Pearson correlation was employed to examine the correlation between the stringent index and mean contacts over time . The red colors signify positive correlation , the blue pieces signify negative correlation , the coeﬃcients and P - values of each subgroup were annotated in gray on the upper right of each cell . The time series of the stringency index is represented by the brown lines on the left , which map to the second y - axis of the settings for all age groups combined . Methods The contact tracing database was compiled during an epidemi - ology ﬁeld investigation that responded to an Omicron outbreak in Quanzhou City , China between March 13 , 2022 and April 14 , 2022 . All the cases were traced in this outbreak and conﬁrmed by reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction positive results . Close contacts include people who have contacted within proxim - ity in the 2 days before the identiﬁcation of index cases but have not taken effective protection . The detailed identiﬁcation criteria of close contacts are provided in the Appendix . A total of 66 , 583 close contacts linked to 2036 unique index cases were included . The demographic information and contact settings were obtained for both . In addition , the date of case identiﬁcation , date of isola - tion , the severest clinical outcomes , and occupations were obtained for the infected individuals . We analyzed the index case and close contact pairs . We calcu - lated the mean number of contacts in school , workplace , house - hold , and overall settings . The uncertainty of contact matrixes was quantiﬁed using a 100 - times bootstrap , with replacement on the original contact dataset . We calculated the mean , smoothed over the 1 - week intervals to give a larger number of index cases per estimate . The index cases identiﬁed on each day and 3 days before and after and their close contacts were included per estimate . The Pearson correlation coeﬃcient was used to demonstrate the cor - relation between the mean contact and the stringency index col - lected by the Oxford COVID - 19 Government Response Tracker [ 5 ] . The analyses and generated ﬁgures were conducted using R version 4 . 2 . 1 . Results and discussion At the very beginning of the outbreak in Quanzhou City , coun - termeasures , such as increasing lockdown areas , suspension of public events , strict control of gatherings in schools , and traﬃc re - strictions were promptly taken by the government ( Figure 1 ) . The number of daily new conﬁrmed cases peaked within the ﬁrst week , and the most stringent control was achieved on the third day af - ter the outbreak . As shown in Figure 1 , the mean contacts within households tended to increase over this period , but those in school , at the workplace , and in overall tended to decline . Strong nega - tive correlations can be seen across most age groups in school , at the workplace , and in overall settings . However , positive correla - tions were found within household circumstances . The 15 - 20 years age group population in school settings likewise showed a posi - tive correlation ; this might relate to a sense of urgency heightened by the fact that the gaokao ( one of the most inﬂuential examina - tions in China ) will be completed in less than 100 days . Thus , se - nior students and high school teachers were reluctant to switch to online teaching . In addition , because of the residential system , high school students stayed in school 5 - 6 days a week despite so - cial constraints and maintained regular contact in the school set - ting . In the overall setting , the elderly aged > 60 years also showed a propensity for mean contacts to rise as the stringency index in - creased . The elderly might be able to meet more family members than usual when the city advocates or requires people not to leave their homes . Studies have shown that households remain impor - tant venues for transmission [ 3 , 6 , 7 ] , and it is essential to imple - ment multicomponent prevention strategies , including up - to - date 47 Y .

( a ) The estimated number of contacts made by asymptomatic and symptomatic infections with 95 % conﬁdence intervals . ( b , c ) Age - mixing patterns of index cases and their close contacts . The age was categorized into 16 age groups . Each cell of the matrix represents the mean number of daily contacts produced by a member in each age group with other individuals . The color intensity represents the number of daily contacts . ( d ) Proportions by severity for cases with high numbers of contacts . The number of contacts attributed to the two days of contact tracing . ( e ) Proportions by severity for cases caused high numbers of secondary cases . The number of secondary cases is calculated by counting the infected individuals that occur among close contacts after exposure to an index case . vaccination , isolation of infected persons , and mask use at home [ 8 ] . The mean contacts were 11 . 81 ( 95 % conﬁdence interval , 11 . 61 - 12 . 01 ) for asymptomatic cases and 6 . 70 ( 95 % conﬁdence inter - val , 6 . 54 - 6 . 87 ) for symptomatic cases ( Figure 2 a ) . Then , we fur - ther explored the index cases with high contacts and cases that produced a high number of secondary infections . More than 65 % of cases who had > 50 close contacts were asymptomatic ( at the time of investigation ) ( Figure 2 d ) , and among cases with a high transmissibility that caused secondary infections in > 10 people , given that the average basic reproduction number of Omicron is around 9 . 5 [ 9 ] , the asymptomatic cases ( at the time of investiga - tion ) accounted for greater than 80 % ( Figure 2 e ) . Symptomatic pa - tients typically alter their behavioral patterns when they develop symptoms , such as reducing the frequency of having close contacts or paying greater attention to self - protection . In contrast , asymp - tomatic cases lack the self - awareness to restrict social events be - fore testing positive . Notably , of all conﬁrmed cases linked to close contacts in this outbreak , the proportion of asymptomatic cases made up 64 . 86 % . In this case , emphasis should be placed on broad screenings with high eﬃcacy . Rapid antigen testing has a relatively low detection sensitivity [ 10 , 11 ] , but if it is widely used , it may help a signiﬁcant number of asymptomatic people become aware of their infection , hence limiting their social interactions with oth - ers . Consequently , the likelihood of ongoing transmission through crowds can be decreased . Conclusion By summarizing and comparing the contact patterns , this study draws the conclusion that rapidly adapted public health and so - cial measures can reduce the mean contacts in public places in a timely manner before the epidemic curve peaks . However , these measures also increase contacts within households , necessitating the need for pertinent prevention strategies . We also saw that asymptomatic cases contribute signiﬁcantly to Omicron transmis - sion . By making asymptomatic people aware that they are already contagious and thus modifying their behavioral patterns , lowering the risk of spreading the disease is possible .
