Cellular entry of the causative agent SARS - CoV - 2 is mediated by its spike protein interacting with cellular receptor - human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) . Here , we used lentivirus based pseudotypes bearing spike protein to demonstrate that entry of SARS - CoV - 2 into host cells is dependent on clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and phosphoinositides play essential role during this process . In addition , we showed that the intracellular domain and the catalytic activity of ACE2 is not required for efficient virus entry . These results provide new insights into SARS - CoV - 2 cellular entry and present potential targets for drug development . Introduction Since the beginning of this century , there have been three beta - coronaviruses crossed the species barrier to cause severe respiratory diseases . In 2002 - 2003 , sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) infected 8096 people and caused 774 deaths ( 1 ) . In 2012 , Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) was discovered as causative agent of a severe respiratory syndrome in the middle east area and as of January 2020 , more than 2500 people was diagnosed with MERS , with 866 associated deaths ( WHO ) . In late 2019 , a novel coronavirus , named SARS - CoV - 2 emerged and soon transmitted to cause a globally pandemic . As of January 2021 , there were over 100 million confirmed cases of COVID - 19 worldwide , resulting in more than 2 million deaths ( coronavirus . jhu . edu ) . All three coronaviruses are believed to originate from bats but zoonotic transmission involved different intermediate hosts . With numerous coronaviruses in bats , it is likely that coronavirus crises will continue to occur in the foreseeable future ( 2 ) . Cellular entry of coronavirus is mediated by its spike glycoprotein ( S ) by interacting with cellular receptors . The sequences of SARS - CoV and SARS - CoV - 2 S protein are conserved and numerous studies have shown that they exploited the same receptor , angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) ( 3 - 6 ) . Different from SARS - CoV , the S protein of SARS - CoV - 2 was efficiently processed into two subunits , S1 and S2 , which mediates attachment and membrane fusion , respectively ( 3 , 6 ) . Structural analysis showed that S protein formed trimer with the receptor - binding domain exposed up for easy receptor accessibility ( 5 , 6 ) . ACE2 is a type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain with homology to ACE and a short cytoplasmic tail ( 7 , 8 ) . ACE2 is a Zinc metalloprotease that catalyzes the cleavage of Ang I to Ang1 - 9 , but its catalytic activity is not required for spike induced syncytia formation ( 9 ) . The entry of enveloped viruses into cells is known to occur via two primary pathways , i . e . direct membrane fusion at the cell surface , or endocytosis , with the latter being a pH - sensitive process ( 10 ) . The endocytic pathways exploited by animal viruses to gain entry into host cells include clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , caveolae - dependent endocytosis , as well as poorly characterized routes such as clathrin - and caveolae - independent endocytosis ( 11 ) . SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV S can be triggered to fuse either at the plasma membrane or the endosomal membrane depending on protease availability ( 12 ) . In addition , SARS - CoV has been shown to enter host cells via direct membrane fusion , clathrin - mediated endocytosis or non - clathrin , non - caveolae - mediated endocytosis ( 13 - 15 ) , suggesting the virus might employ various strategies to expand its cellular tropism . The specific endocytic pathways SARS - CoV - 2 exploited have not been fully characterized . Phosphoinositides ( PI ) are known to be involved in the whole process of endocytosis ( 16 ) , of note , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has long been thought to be the most important PI during CME ( 17 - 21 ) . A recent study demonstrated that a successive PI molecular conversions accompanies the clathrin - coated pit assembly , budding and uncoating with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI4P , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 function at different stages of CME ( 22 ) . Interestingly , SARS - CoV has been reported to require PI4KIII  for cell entry and depletion of PI4P by Sac1 inhibited viral entry ( 23 ) , suggesting a role of PI4P during viral entry . In contrast , inhibitors targeting PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 blocked SARS - CoV - 2 viral entry ( 4 ) . Whether other PI molecules are required for SARS - CoV - 2 entry is still unknown . Here we demonstrated that SARS - CoV - 2 entered cells via clathrin - mediated endocytosis , but independent of caveolae - mediated endocytosis . Distinct from SARS - CoV , SARS - CoV - 2 did not seem to require lipid rafts for infection . In addition , phosphatidylinositol molecules PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 also played essential roles during virus entry . Finally , we showed that the cytoplasmic domain and the enzymatic activity of ACE2 were not required for SARS - CoV - 2 entry . Our data provided new insights into SARS - CoV - 2 cellular entry and presented potential targets for drug development . Results Incorporation of S protein into pseudovirus and infection of pseudovirus on different cells . Pseudovirus has been widely used to mimic the entry of real virus and is a powerful tool for studying early events in the life cycle of a virus . We here employed a lentivirus - based pseudovirus to study the entry of SARS - CoV - 2 . To facilitate the incorporation of SARS - CoV - 2 S protein into pseudovirus , we employed a method similar as previously reported in ( 4 ) . A codon - optimized cDNA encoding the S protein was synthesized and the C - terminal last 19 amino acids , which contains an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal was replaced with FLAG tag ( Fig S1A ) . Immunoblotting showed that codon - optimized S cDNA expressed at a much higher level than that of native spike in 293T cells ( Fig S1B ) . In addition , consistent with previous reports ( 3 , 4 , 6 ) , the S protein was processed and two major bands were observed , reflecting the full - length and cleaved S proteins respectively ( Fig S1B ) . To confirm S protein was efficiently incorporated into the pseudovirus , spike and VSV - G protein - bearing pseudoviruses were pelleted by ultracentrifugation and tested against anti - spike antibody and anti - HIV - p24 antibody ( Fig 1A ) . The results showed that the majority of S proteins on pseudovirus were cleaved , suggesting the S protein was efficiently processed in host cells . Next , we tested whether these Spike - bearing pseudoviruses ( S pseudovirus ) were able to transduce host cells . For this purpose , we infected 293T , Vero E6 , Huh 7 and 293T cells overexpressing ACE2 with S or VSV - G protein pseudovirus containing a luciferase reporter gene . As expected , VSV - G pseudovirus transduced all four cell types efficiently . Compared to 293T cells , overexpression of ACE2 enhanced S pseudovirus infection , suggesting SARS - CoV - 2 utilized ACE2 as a receptor . In addition , although both Vero E6 and Huh 7 cells can be transduced by S pseudovirus , Huh 7 gave more than two - fold increase in luciferase activity than Vero E6 cells ( Figure 1B ) . Thus , Huh 7 was chosen for the following viral entry studies . Similarly , GFP - expressing pseudoviruses also transduced the above cells lines successfully ( Fig 1C ) , further suggesting that the S pseudovirus we prepared can be used for viral entry studies . S pseudovirus enters cells via clathrin - mediated endocytosis We next tested whether SARS - CoV - 2 enters cells via endocytosis or direct membrane fusion at plasma membrane . In contrast to direct membrane fusion , endocytosis is thought to be pH - dependent ( 24 ) . When Huh 7 cells were pretreated with lysosomotropic agents , like chloroquine , ammonium chloride or bafilomycin A1 , significant decreases of transduction were observed for both VSV - G and SARS - CoV - 2 S pseudovirus ( Fig 2A ) , suggesting that SARS - CoV - 2 entry of Huh 7 cells is pH - dependent . Consistent with this , dual immunostaining of S protein and early endosome marker EEA1 showed colocalization ( Fig 2B ) , supporting that S pseudovirus infected Huh 7 cells via endocytosis . Importantly , we observed that S pseudovirus transduction correlated with higher EEA1 expression in cells ( Fig . S2 ) and immunoblotting showed that S pseudovirus transduction up - regulated EEA1 expression in Huh 7 cells ( Fig 2B ) . All these suggested that SARS - CoV - 2 enters cells via pH - dependent endocytosis . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is the best documented mode of endocytosis , to test whether SARS - CoV - 2 gain entry into cells via CME , we first pretreated cells with clathrin inhibitor , pitstop ( 25 ) . Pitstop inhibited the entry of SARS - CoV - 2 in Huh 7 cells in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig 2C ) . Similarly , chlorpromazine ( CPZ ) , which prevents the assembly of coated pits at the cell surface , also inhibited the entry of SARS - CoV - 2 in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig 2D ) . To overcome any nonspecific effect the chemical compounds may have , we also carried out an orthogonal CRISPR / Cas9 knockout experiment . Huh 7 cells stably transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding the sgRNA targeting clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) and Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 were first validated of gene targeting ( Fig 2E ) and then transduced with luciferase encoding S pseudovirus . The magnitude of luciferase activity correlated with the expression of CHC ( Fig 2F ) , suggesting SARS - CoV - 2 entry is dependent on clathrin . S pseudovirus infection does not require caveolae - mediated endocytosis Caveolae are small , flask - shaped invaginations in the plasma membrane composed of high levels of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids as well as the integral membrane protein caveolin ( 26 ) . To determine whether SARS - CoV - 2 enters cells through a caveolae - mediated pathway , we first treated cells with filipin or methyl -  - cyclodextrin ( M  CD ) , both of which could disrupt the integrity of cholesterol - enriched membrane microdomains ( 27 ) . Compared to control cells , uptake of cholera toxin subunit B ( CTB ) , which has been reported to be internalized via caveolae - mediated endocytosis ( 28 - 30 ) , was blocked at cell surface when cells were treated with filipin or M  CD ( Fig S2 ) , suggesting these drugs can block caveolae - mediated endocytosis . However , neither drug inhibited the huh 7 transduction of S pseudovirus ( Fig 3A , 3B ) , indicating that SARS - CoV - 2 entry of Huh 7 cells was independent of cholesterol - enriched membrane microdomains . To further study whether the caveolae - dependent pathway was involved in the endocytosis of this virus , we knocked out the expression of caveolin - 1 ( CAV - 1 , Figure 3C ) , which is the main scaffolding protein of the caveolae membranes in most cell types ( 31 ) . Figure 3D showed that S pseudovirus could infect Huh 7 cells in the absence of CAV - 1 , suggesting the viral entry is independent of caveolae . This finding was further corroborated by the immunostaining experiment . The infected cells immune - labelled for SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein and for caveolin - 1 showed little colocalization ( Figure 3E ) . Taken together , these results indicated that SARS - CoV - 2 is able to enter cells in a caveolae - independent manner . PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are crucial for SARS - CoV - 2 entry Phosphoinositides ( PI ) are known to be involved throughout the process of endocytosis . Of note , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI4P and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 are essential molecules in endocytosis . We found that overexpression of either inositol polyphosphate - 5 - phosphatase E ( INPP5E ) , which converts PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PI4P , or the sac1 phosphatase , which dephosphorylates PI4P ( Fig . 4A , Fig . S4 ) , inhibited S pseudovirus transduction of 293 - hACE2 cells ( Fig . 4B ) , suggesting that PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are involved in SARS - CoV - 2 entry . Importantly , SARS - CoV entry has been reported to be dependent on phosphatidylinositol 4 - kinase III  ( PI4KB ) ( 23 ) , and pretreating Huh 7 cells with phosphatidylinositol kinase inhibitors , PIK93 or wortmannin , inhibited S pseudovirus transduction at concentrations that effectively inhibited PI4 - kinase activity ( Fig . 4C ) , suggesting that PI4 kinase is also involved in SARS - CoV - 2 infection . To better characterize the role of PI4KB in virus entry , we use shRNAs to knockdown PI4KB expression and found decreased virus infection in PI4KB knockdown cells ( Fig . 4D ) , indicating the role of PI4KB during viral entry . SARS - CoV - 2 entry does not require the intracellular domain and catalytic sites of ACE2 Receptor - mediated endocytosis involves the interaction of the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor proteins with intracellular proteins to initiate internalization ( 32 - 34 ) , and studies have shown that cytoplasmic domain of cell surface receptors could control endocytosis ( 35 , 36 ) . ACE2 is a type I transmembrane protein with a short cytoplasmic tail ( 7 , 8 ) . We therefore tested whether the cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 is required for SARS - CoV - 2 entry . 293T cells overexpressing ACE2 mutant lacking the intracellular tail could be infected by SARS - CoV - 2 pseudovirus as efficiently as wild - type ACE2 ( Figure 5A - C ) . We further examined the receptor activity of ACE2 mutants with either the transmembrane domain of EGFR or the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of human ACE , the close homologue of ACE2 which could not support virus infection . Both mutants could support infection of SARS - CoV - 2 ( Figure 5A - C ) . These results suggested that the cytoplasmic domain of ACE2 is not required for its SARS - CoV - 2 infection and that there is no specificity of the transmembrane domain for its receptor activity . We next tested whether the enzyme activity of ACE2 is required for SARS - CoV - 2 infection . ACE2 is a Zinc metalloprotease with a single HEXXH zinc - binding motif ( 37 , 38 ) . In addition , ACE2 structure modeling and site - directed mutagenesis analysis showed that His505 plays an essential role in the catalysis of ACE2 ( 39 - 41 ) ( Fig 5D ) . To test whether enzymatic activity of ACE2 is required for SARS - CoV - 2 entry , 293T cells overexpressing ACE2 that bears two zinc - binding histidine mutations ( H374N & H378N , CM1 ) were transduced with S pseudovirus . Figure 5F showed that this mutant support viral infection equally well to wild type ACE2 . Similarly , 293T cells overexpressing ACE2 catalytic site histidine mutation ( H505L , CM2 ) , or the combination of all three histidine mutations ( H374N & H378N & H505L , CM3 ) could be transduced by S pseudovirus as efficiently ( Fig . 5D - F ) . These results suggested that the enzymatic activity of ACE2 is not required for SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Discussion Viral entry represents the first step of virus - host interaction and glycoprotein - bearing pseudoviruses have been wildly used for viral entry studies . Here we generated Spike protein bearing pseudoviruses that had either a luciferase or GFP reporter gene . These viruses could transduce host cells expressing ACE2 receptor and therefore could be used for viral entry studies . For enveloped viruses , the viral envelop must fuse with host membranes either at cell surface or in endosomes before the successful release of viral genome into host cells . SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV have been reported to utilize both pathways depending on the availability of exogenous and membrane bound proteases ( 12 ) . The entry of SARS - CoV - 2 has been reported to require cell surface protease TMPRSS2 ( 3 ) , suggesting direct membrane at cell surface is possible . In addition , several studies have demonstrated that lysosomotropic agents could block SARS - CoV - 2 entry ( 3 , 4 ) , indicating the virus may also enter via endocytosis . Here we got similar results when cells were treated with lysosomotropic agents . In addition , we found colocalization of spike protein with early endosome marker EEA1 , further proved that this virus could enter cells via pH - dependent endocytosis . As the best characterized endocytosis pathways , clathrin - mediated endocytosis has been reported to be involved in various viral infection , including SARS - CoV ( 14 ) . Here by using different chemical inhibitors and CRISPR / Cas9 targeting the major protein in clathrin coat formation , we demonstrated that SARS - CoV - 2 entry also was dependent on clathrin . While we are preparing this manuscript , Bayati et al . reported that the Spike protein of SARS - CoV - 2 endocytosis is dependent on clathrin and S pseudovirus can be blocked by CHC siRNA treatment ( 42 ) . Consistently , we also showed that SARS - CoV - 2 pseudovirus enters cell via CME , in addition , we also showed that this process is independent of caveolae - mediated endocytosis , another common endocytosis pathway . The fact that Caco2 cells , which do not express caveolin ( 43 ) , could support SARS - CoV - 2 infection efficiently ( 44 ) also suggested that this virus could infect cells independent of caveolae . PI4P and PI4KB have been reported to be essential for SARS - CoV infection ( 23 ) and a recent report showed that PIKfyve inhibitors could block S pseudovirus infection ( 4 ) , which all suggested that phosphoinositides pathways are important for coronavirus infection . Here we further demonstrated that PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are essential molecules for SARS - CoV - 2 infection and PI4KB is also required for SARS - CoV - 2 entry . The role of cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 in SARS - CoV infection is controversial ( 14 , 45 ) . We found that the cytoplasmic domain as well as the enzymatic activity of ACE2 are not required for efficient virus entry , which are consistent with the facts that the receptor - binding domain of S interacts with the N - terminal peptidase domain of ACE2 and the enzymatic sites are not in direct contacts with spike as revealed by the S - ACE2 complex structure ( 46 , 47 ) . In summary , we demonstrated that SARS - CoV - 2 pseudovirus infects cells via pH - dependent endocytosis , which is dependent on clathrin , but not caveolae . Phosphoinositides pathways , particularly , PI4KB is required for efficient virus infection . In addition , we showed that the intracellular domain and the catalytic activity of ACE2 are not required for viral infection . Overall , these results provided new insights into SARS - CoV - 2 cellular entry and present more precise targets for antiviral drug development .
