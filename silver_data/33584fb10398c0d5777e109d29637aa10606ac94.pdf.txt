We describe practices associated with dealing with inherited family archives ; the creation of new artefacts , such as scrapbooks and collections of letters , out of repurposed archived materials ; and the recording of one’s memoirs . Our analysis leads us to emphasise a distinction between ‘personal’ memory and memory ‘for family’ , noting that while memory is used in the construction of a sense of one’s own history , and in enabling personal reflection on the past , the work that is bound up with processing archives and producing new artefacts is heavily influenced by a desire to make them accessible and relevant to children and grandchildren , both now and in the future . The tending to , and crafting of , these materials can be understood as a means of creating a ‘joint’ past and reinforcing a wider family narrative . We conclude that through these practices , memory was used as a resource for self , but also for future family life . - 3 - CONTENTS Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 1 .

INTRODUCTION The past is salient for all sorts of action . Workplaces need it ; organisations act on it ; legal institutions investigate it . For persons too the past is vital . The past is not simply something one has but is something one uses . It can be drawn upon in the construction of one’s own history , and it can be shared with others , becoming a vehicle for family and friendship . It is no wonder then that the means by which the past is brought to life , memory , is at once a topic of great appeal to HCI ( Human - Computer Interaction ) and a source of huge interest to the social sciences . In this paper , we report findings from a study of persons who considered themselves to be ‘recording their memories for posterity’ , focusing in particular on the “processing” of inherited family archives , the creation of new artefacts out of repurposed archived materials , and the recording of one’s memoirs . In doing so , we consider a tension that emerges in the data between memory as ‘personal’ and memory ‘for family’ , and highlight this in considering opportunities for design . First though , we consider literature related to this topic , including theories of memory as personal , studies that position it as a resource for action in a social context , research that shows how it is bound up with material practices at home , and the relationship between personal memories and family stories . 2 . BACKGROUND 2 . 1 Memory as Personal The notion of memory as ‘personal’ is well - established in the field of Psychology and , as the theme of this special issues attests , is also highly influential within HCI . Memories of one’s own past are often referred to within Psychology as ‘autobiographical’ memory , and although approaches to this concept vary ( see e . g . Rubin , 1999 ) , one of the more prominent models is Conway and Pleydell - Pearce ( 2000 ) ’s description of autobiographical memory as part of a ‘self - memory system’ . In this model , autobiographical memories are understood as transitory , dynamic mental constructions , which are generated from an underlying knowledge base . The knowledge base is proposed to be highly sensitive to cues , with the result that patterns of activation continuously arise and dissipate across it in response to prompts such as sights , sounds and smells . To prevent the constant intrusion of memories , they are only constructed and consciously experienced if they are consistent with the current goals of ‘the self’ . This notion of the self is central to Conway and Pleydell - Pearce’s concept , and is used to explain a bias for memory of self - relevant and self - formative events . Indeed , several researchers have noted the privileged status in memory of ‘self - defining moments’ ( Singer & Salovey , 1993 ) and events that matter to an evolving life story ( Nelson , 1993 ) . McAdams and Adler ( 2010 ) propose a life story model of adult identity , arguing that people draw on key events in working to transform the past into something they can make sense of today , and Pillemer ( 1998 ) suggests that salient and memorable episodes provide a framework for the narrative representation of a person’s life . Drawing these arguments together , we can surmise that memories are not retrieved but are formed ; narratives are actively reconstructed ( and co - constructed with others ) ; a life story is interpreted and retrospectively re - interpreted ; and narrative truth ( following Spence , - 5 - 1982 , cited in Pillemer , 1998 ) and belief , rather than objective truth , is bound up with identity . This view of memory has been influential in informing the design of a number of prototype technologies in HCI . For example , van den Hoven and Eggen ( 2008 ) explicitly draw on Conway and Pleydell - Pearce’s model in suggesting guidelines for an augmented memory system . They note the importance of cueing , and use this in the development of a Digital Photo Browser , in which souvenirs serve to cue recollections whilst also linking to digital photos . The notion of cueing memory is also drawn upon widely and implicitly in explorations of audio as a trigger for revisiting the past ( Oleksik et al . , 2008 ) , the production of ‘audiophotographs’ ( Frohlich , 2004 ) , and the augmentation of objects with sound clips ( Frohlich and Murphy , 2000 ) . Interestingly , the effectiveness of technology in supporting recall tends to be assumed rather than evaluated , although Sellen et al . ( 2007 ) demonstrate that photos captured with a lifelogging device , SenseCam , often support a sense of knowing that something happened rather that a full recollection ( or re - living ) of the experience , and van den Hoven and Eggen ( 2009 ) show that a simple prompt to write down one’s memories elicited more detailed accounts than audio , video , photography , objects , or odour - based cues . Sellen and Whittaker ( 2010 ) suggest that it is essential to avoid the assumption that memories can be ‘captured’ with technology , and to instead focus on the benefits that such technologies might provide . While their critique is of lifelogging technologies , their argument can be applied more broadly , raising the question of what we are designing for when we design to support ‘personal memory’ . One area of research within HCI that does clearly aim to support what memory ‘does’ is the body of work on technologies for users with cognitive impairment . For example , Alm et al . ( 2004 ) explore the use of images and audio relating to local history as a way of triggering the long - term memories of persons with dementia , thus supporting interest and participation in conversations with their caregivers . A similar but more personalised approach is taken in Multimedia Biographies ( Damianakis et al . , 2009 ; Smith et al . , 2009 ) , in which ‘video life stories’ were developed by researchers , in conjunction with participants and family caregivers , for persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and mild cognitive impairment . Again , the format is intended to provide a shared space for conversation although , in this project , the work of producing personalised biographies was additionally noted as providing a reflective experience and a sense of accomplishment ( Smith et al . , 2009 ) . Relatedly , Biography Theatre ( Massimi et al . , 2008 ) presents a digital life history as an ambient slideshow . A deployment in the home of Mr H , a man with Alzheimer’s Disease , did not result in any improvement in memory , but was noted as altering the way memory was factored into family life . Importantly , the system provided an occasion for remembering , enabled Mr H to talk about the past , and seemed to result in an improved sense of identity . Following Harper et al . ( 2008 ) , Massimi et al . note that the Biography Theatre was a ‘resource for action’ . Indeed , in all of these projects , technology is used in service of memory . It provides a focus for conversation , the chance to reflect , and the opportunity to consider the past . - 6 - 2 . 2 Beyond ‘Personal’ Memories The work discussed above highlights the role that memory plays in social interaction with others and touches on the idea that memory has ramifications beyond the ‘personal’ . Indeed , social interaction models , which highlight the interpersonal nature of memory , have been proposed . Hirst and Manier ( 1999 ) argue that memories emerge out of forms of discourse and cannot be understood as distinct from these , and Tversky ( 2004 ) has demonstrated that omissions and exaggerations , done in the spirit of telling a story , can become conflated with and distort memories of the event talked about . Further , it has been shown that the form that narratives take are shaped by interactions during childhood ( Nelson , 1993 ) , with children learning how to formulate their memories as narratives from their parents . The context of remembering also impacts the form that memory narratives take . Webster et al . , ( 2010 ) suggest that reminiscing differs in personal and interpersonal contexts , and with respect to cultural and familial boundaries . This framing of memory as interpersonal and sociocultural is also bound up with theories of what memory ‘does’ . Nelson ( 1993 ) suggests that the functional significance of autobiographical memory is that of sharing it with others , and Tannen ( 1990 ) theorises that the details that are conveyed in talk about the past are a way of conveying intimacy , especially among women . Fivish et al . ( 1999 ) argue that joint remembering creates interpersonal bonds based on a sense of shared history , and Bruner and Feldman ( 1999 ) contend that any group that wants to constitute itself has to develop shared stories that define identity and guide discovery of meaning . In addition to this positioning of memory as beyond ‘personal’ , objects that somehow represent memories , even if just for oneself , are also bound up with social relationships and the maintenance of intimacy . Research into family archiving practices demonstrates how mementos are integrated into living spaces and everyday life ( Petrelli et al . , 2008 ) , and how objects , as vehicles of narrative excursion , are used not only to define the self and connect with the past , but also to honour others , frame the family , fulfil a duty , and enable forgetting ( Kirk & Sellen , 2010 ) . Kirk and Sellen argue that material practices make manifest the social relationships of the home , and this includes the ‘putting away’ and ‘keeping safe’ of objects . For example , a significant other could be honoured through display of a photograph or use of an artefact they once owned ( ladles and recipe books are good examples of this ) , or through the deep and secure storage of an object that represents them in some way . These notions of putting away and safekeeping have also been highlighted by Odom et al . ( in press ) , specifically in relation to heirlooms . Relatedly , Finch and Mason ( 2000 ) note that the ‘cherishing’ of inherited objects is what distinguishes ‘keepsakes’ , which are treasured in the context of a relationship and enable those not present to be incorporated into family life , from ‘heirlooms’ , which are ‘just kept’ . 2 . 3 Memories for ‘the Family’ Central to Finch and Mason’s ( 2000 ) argument is that inheritance is relational ; moral decisions are manifest in who inherits what , with the status of an object as a ‘keepsake’ being dependent on it being inherited by the ‘right’ person . This discussion of objects by which one can be remembered can be contrasted with the possibility to document one’s - 7 - memories , to be ‘passed on’ to others . In this section , we consider two guides that give advice on the writing ( Spence , 1997 ) and recording ( Rosenbluth , 1997 ) of memoirs and life stories . In both cases the anticipated audience is family , including unknown future family members , and the importance of doing this before it is ‘too late’ is noted . However , there are some interesting contrasts in these two texts . While Spence places control in the hands of the writer , advising that they reflect on their experiences and convey what they have learnt with age , Rosenbluth places the adult children in an ‘interviewer’ role , and positions interviewing a parent as a way of ‘honouring’ them . Interestingly , she also suggests that the interview format can enable the asking of ‘difficult’ questions by redefining the parent - child relationship , and addresses the question , “who has the right to tell a secret ? ” ( p . 92 ) . In Rosenbluth’s account , the tapes are implicitly owned by the family , and the account is explicitly co - constructed rather than ‘told’ . If necessary , she advises that the tape can be re - wound and the interview backtracked . There has been little attention in HCI to the deliberate crafting of legacy objects , although Sandhaus et al . ’s ( 2010 ) ‘My Life Photo Book’ is designed for people at the end of their lives to collate photos and accompanying information . However , some of the work on home archiving does consider the notion of future audiences . Kirk and Sellen ( 2010 ) report instances of parents keeping items from their offspring’s childhood to be given to them once they are grown , and Stevens et al . ( 2003 ) designed the Living Memory Box with scenario of parents “preserving memories” of their children in mind . Petrelli et al . ( 2009 ) consider more broadly the ‘intentional capture of future memories’ through a study in which participants were asked to create time capsules to be opened in 25 years by grandchildren . Participants sought out and created a variety of items to offer a ‘sample of life’ , taking photos of people or places that were not commonly recorded and even writing about memories that they wished to preserve . Perhaps the most striking aspect of Petrelli et al . ’s findings was the nature of the time capsules as a communication to the future . Participants included family jokes , objects to make opening the time capsule more fun , and messages to their future selves ( such as lists of things a 12 year old hoped to have done , which could then be checked off ) . The notion of opening the time capsule , with family , on some future occasion , clearly influenced what was included . Petrelli et al . conclude that technologies to support memory should support active selection , creativity and meaning making , rather than the passive capture that is typical of current lifelogging devices . 2 . 4 Summary The above discussion highlights a number of tensions and blurring of the lines between ‘personal’ memories and memories ‘for family’ . Firstly , we have seen that memories are ‘constructed’ rather than ‘retrieved’ , and this construction is a resource in social interaction . Secondly , we have explored the role of memory in social interaction , noting that shared narratives influence how groups define themselves , play a role in reinforcing bonds , and serve as an expression of intimacy . Thirdly , we have seen that home archiving practices connect people with the past , but also serve as a way of honouring others in the present , and play a role in framing and constituting the family . Finally , we have explored the notion that personal memories can become ‘family stories’ - 8 - or ‘future memories’ , by being documented in a format that enables their passing on , or their opening up and ‘reconstruction’ at a later date . 3 . RECORDING MEMORIES FOR POSTERITY : A FIELD STUDY In this paper , we examine some of the ways in which people attempt to ‘record their memories for posterity’ , with the aim of understanding what this can entail , what motivates it , and what outcomes are hoped for . In doing so , we unpack a distinction between ‘personal’ memory and memory ‘for family’ , and begin to explore what this could mean for design . 3 . 1 Method Eight participants were recruited from a stall at an Age Concern ( a UK age - related charity ) event and from an advert placed in a newsletter aimed at people aged 50 and above in the local area . We specified no criteria other than that we were looking to interview people who were ‘recording their memories for posterity’ , however , all participants were grandparents living in the South - East of England . They were engaging in a number of activities that they considered to fit the idea of recording memories for posterity , including managing family archives , creating new artefacts such as scrapbooks and edited collections of old letters , and writing their memoirs . Details are given in Figure 1 . Pseudonyms are used throughout this paper to preserve anonymity . [ Figure 1 about here ] This is a small sample and was not intended to be representative . Instead , in - depth interviews and iterative data analyses were conducted to enable the reaching of a rich understanding of the practices that participants engaged in and the values that were bound up with this . Participants were interviewed at home so that archived materials and documents that had been created , such as memoirs , could be viewed and used to ground the discussion . The interviews were semi - structured and flexible in order to accommodate the different activities that were encountered and the role of technology within them . Questions were asked regarding what the different activities involved , the motivation behind them , the intended audiences for any artefacts that were produced , whether help had been solicited or provided , whether any barriers to the process had been encountered or overcome , and if any next steps were planned . The sessions were audio - recorded and transcribed , and artefacts such as archived materials and manuscripts that had been produced were photographed . A £20 gift voucher was offered for participation . 3 . 2 Data Analyses Transcripts of the interviews were analysed using grounded theory techniques , as described by Strauss and Corbin ( 2008 ) , so as to allow themes to emerge from the data in a bottom - up manner . This approach was adopted because of the broad and open - ended nature of the research questions . Initial data analyses comprised of ascribing open codes ; iteration during this phase involved an exploration of the relationships between these ( axial coding ) . Higher - level themes ( categories ) were then identified by examining - 9 - properties that were shared across codes . Further iterations were undertaken centring on the core concept of ‘narrative through time’ ; this ultimately resulted in the identification of four overarching themes . An example of how some of these data are interlinked is presented in Figure 2 . [ Figure 2 about here ] In the following two sections , two sets of activities described by participants are detailed . The first , in Section 4 , relates to dealing with inherited family archives , and the second , in Section 5 , relates to creating new records about one’s personal memories . In Section 6 , broader conceptual themes are used to position a discussion of opportunities for design . 4 . FINDINGS : DEALING WITH INHERITED ARCHIVES In this section we explore a set of activities that entailed looking after “the archive” ( Lisa ) or “the family archive” ( Edward ) . These were collections of content , related in some way to the extended family ( both past and present ) , and representing family history . Materials tended to be mixed , comprising , for example , photo albums , letters , family trees and funeral notices . The archives themselves were often described in terms that emphasised passivity , giving a sense that they could lie dormant ( “there they lay” , Lisa ) ) , be received rather than deliberately acquired ( “it came to me” , Edward ) ) , and simply needed to be “preserved” ( Lisa ) or kept safe . Perhaps most importantly , they were bound up with a sense of permanence ; they were expected to outlast whoever was currently looking after them , being kept with the view that they would be eventually passed on to someone else . The role of archivist was therefore seen as temporary , adopted in the context of wider family and undertaken with the expectation that it would eventually be fulfilled by someone else . However , a deeper exploration of archiving revealed practices that were anything but passive and materials that were understood as being potentially vulnerable rather than permanent . First of all , archives did not exist or ‘come to one’ as a neatly packaged set . They needed to be identified and stored , especially when obtained in the context of another family member having died , and this entailed making decisions about what to add , maintain and discard . The passing of a family member meant the incorporation of new material into the family archive , which would previously have been understood as ‘personal’ . For example , a series of early love letters between the now deceased mother and father of Lisa , which had not been read by anyone else whilst they were alive , were now considered part of the family archive . The fact that “what I am referring to as the archive is what my parents decided not to chuck out” was viewed as an implicit form of consent for this change in status . Interestingly , ownership did not transfer to Lisa , who considered herself to be giving them “house room” . Instead , they were understood to be owned by ‘the family’ , and this was clearly apparent in the permission she sought from her sisters before repurposing them ( a topic we return to in section 5 ) . Thus the role of family archivist was bound up with certain responsibilities but ( and in contrast to the way one might view one’s own personal artefacts ) did not entitle ownership . In what follows , - 10 - we highlight three of the activities associated with the role : guarding against loss , making artefacts accessible , and making new discoveries . Guarding against loss . Having delineated the contents of the archive , many of the participants described a set of “processing” ( Lisa ) activities that came with it . For example , Brenda was engaged in the activity of taking photos out of albums with acidic pages , and Lisa was digitising photos . The duplication that is made possible through digitisation was seen to offer a safeguard against dangers such as fire , but in this case a further reason was offered : future generations may lose contact with one another : “There will be some people who don’t know that it was in my cupboard that it all rested , I suppose in a sense that was the point of this , that these books will lie around in a lot of families , a lot of households , giving a clue to where they could find out more” ( Lisa ) Rosie also commented that a DVD would be more accessible to future generations because “it’s much more what they’re used to” . Thus guarding against loss pertained not only to loss of the content itself , but also the possibility of losing touch with it . The notion of guarding against loss also motivated processing as a reworking of archived materials for the benefit of future generations , driven by the concern that materials would no longer be meaningful to the family in the future . For instance , in the case of photos , it was believed that future generations would not know who the people in them were . Supplementing the images with knowledge ‘in the head’ was therefore viewed as essential . As an example of this , Lisa was producing a word document to detail who was depicted in a selection of the family photos . Family trees were also kept up to date , there being no sense that archived materials should not be tampered with ; the mix of biro and ink in Figure 3 illustrates this nicely . Thus , participants worked to avoid a loss of meaningfulness regarding the content they were housing . [ Figure 3 about here ] Making artifacts accessible . Archived materials could also be repurposed as a way of making them accessible to others within the family . Participants produced scrapbooks about specific family members , DVD “life stories” compiled out of photos and video clips , and edited collections of letters . These could be picked up and flicked through or , in the case of the DVD , played ; this was not a collection of files , but a DVD that could be watched . Bound up with the finished nature of these artefacts was the fact that they told a story . To some extent the artefacts that were repurposed lent themselves to a narrative structure ( as in the case of letters ) but this was also predicated on the careful selection of content . As Brenda said of the scrapbook shown in Figure 4 , “less is more” . [ Figure 4 about here ] In most cases , there was a sense that these artefacts were produced in honour of a person , most commonly a parent . Lisa’s collection of letters , sent between her parents , was described as a “tribute” to them , and Brenda was producing a DVD about her mother using video - editing tools , as a way of drawing together video clips and photos that she - 11 - had of her . In this case , the DVD was played to Brenda’s granddaughter , as a way of underpinning a relationship between them . Relatedly , Lisa chose to self - publish her parents’ letters , printing a limited number of editions and giving a personalised copy to each one of their descendants ( “even the babies” ) . In these examples we see practices that turn archived materials into accessible , standalone objects that convey a clear narrative . Further , the repurposing of materials in this way was used as a way of continuing to incorporate great - grandparents , who had since passed away , into family life . Making new discoveries . The final set of activities we encountered may be better described as a hobbyist activity than an obligation of family archiving , but it is sufficiently bound up with archived materials to be worth noting here . A number of participants were using materials within their archives to make new discoveries about their families . This was especially associated with family trees , which enabled the locating of ‘new’ family members , who could then provide further information about the family and , in some cases , deliver their own version of the family tree : “Now this Catherine , I think it was , got in touch with me . . and so through her and her knowledge of her Aunt Penelope they produced an up - to - date tree … I have just sort of written to these people I f I had an address and asked . . can they tell me , you know , their later generations and their family trees” ( Edward ) . In a related example , Brenda had recently acquired a set of “cards” ( see Figure 5 ) from an elderly relative whom she had come into contact with , which she was trying to date by undertaking research on fashions from the past . She noted , “it’s quite exciting when I get a new find” . However , it was important to retain control over one’s ‘own’ content . Steven reported his frustration at being matched with a distant relative through the website ‘Genes Reunited’ , whose family tree he felt to be incorrect , but which was merged with his own . He eventually disassociated himself from the match to preserve the integrity of his own tree , saying “I just deleted the lot” . [ Figure 5 about here ] 5 . FINDINGS : CREATING RECORDS ABOUT THE PAST Processing inherited archives and creating new artefacts out of them can be contrasted with another set of activities : recording a record of the past by drawing on memory . Attempts at this typically took the form of written accounts , although one couple ( Rosie and Eugene ) expressed the wish to create a spoken version of their memoirs . Like artefacts made from repurposed archived materials , memoirs were intended to be accessible and had relational qualities . However , their creation was bound up with a different set of values , described below , which highlight a tension between ‘personal’ memory and memory ‘for family’ . Conveying a perspective on what is important . While participants had the option of drawing on source materials such as private journals in writing their memoirs , reliance on memory , or information “largely from my head” ( Edward ) was noted as being a natural - 12 - way of identifying important life events and expressing character . That this fed into a decision to rely on memory was in some cases explicitly articulated : “I ' ve done it all from memory , because one of the things I ' ve put in the introduction is that memory actually decides who we think we are , and so by doing all from memory and not researching anything I have actually , hopefully put over some of my character and some of the reasons why I might have done certain things certain ways . ” ( Katie ) “You edit , don’t you ? In your memory … And that’s what’s interesting . If two people write an account of the same happening , it might be very different . ” ( Rosie ) Memoirs embody a unique perspective bound up with time and place . They were organized in terms of themes that participants deemed relevant , or life stages considered important when looking back , with an emphasis on “specific events and how they influenced me” ( Katie ) , “huge marks” ( Eugene ) , “the interesting bits” ( Edward ) , “magical” experiences ( Nicola ) and the newsworthy ( “This made the national papers” , Steven ) . Interestingly , reliance on memory was also noted as a valid reason for omitting certain topics ( “I’ve got a total blank of quite a number of years as a child because of nasty things that were going on at the time” Katie ) . Writing from memory meant that things that are better ‘forgotten’ , even if there remains some awareness of them , could justifiably be excluded . Contributing to a wider family narrative . The above demonstrates an awareness that an account drawn from memory is bound up with a unique perspective , which may differ from that of other family members . Thus , a second , related , value associated with recording memoirs was the positioning of one’s own account within , or against , a wider ‘family’ narrative . As Rosie noted , “you know things you want your children to know” . Indeed , in one case , the writing of memoirs was partly motivated by a wish to put across one’s own version of events : “My retirement party , my daughters did a quiz . . and they’d remembered things slightly different than I had , and I thought mmm , how important is this ? Well it obviously was to me , so I decided to write down as much as I could remember . ” ( Katie ) More generally , recording memoirs was seen as a potential means of enriching children’s understandings of their early years , conveying the details of the family history , and helping them , and grandchildren , know “where they come from” ( Edward ) : “Because my son doesn’t live here ; he lives in the Middle East – in Jordan . So mixed Arab - English parentage , so I wanted him to know more about my side of the family ; he knows a lot about his father’s side of the family . ” ( Rosie ) “I thought it would be nice for the grandchildren because we have got quite a family history you know . ” ( Steven ) This topic was mentioned by participants with family abroad , but also surfaced for participants who had local family ; it was a matter of changing times as well as changing places . As a way of aiding understanding of what was being written about , Steven sought - 13 - out images online of scenes relating to everyday life ( such as old tractors , lorries and farms ) with which to illustrate his memoirs , and Katie included mundane details to offer context and describe what was “normal” . Relatedly , talking about the past was seen as an opportunity to pass on “values” ( Nicola ) and continue family traditions , with the act of storytelling in itself being part of this . Nicola commented , “I’m trying to do what my mother did for me . She told me the stories . ” Thus , recording memoirs was not just about recording memories ; it was about creating a family narrative and doing the ‘work’ of family . Connecting with family in the present . This emphasis on storytelling placed writing about the past firmly in the present for some participants : it was a resource for now . Lisa was writing a series of ‘letters to my grandchildren’ , which would form her memoirs but that were also sent to them on a monthly basis , and Edward had produced a bound manuscript of extracts from letters , sketches and maps about his time in India : “Part of the motivation . . was this daughter . . she took all her family , her husband and four children to India and they travelled around India by train . . part of the idea was that they might compare their experiences of travel in India with mine . ” ( Edward ) In both cases , participants aimed to create engaging and accessible accounts for a specific audience , to be read in the present . This influenced content as well as form ; Edward noted that “I really picked out the travel” in forming his manuscript , and Lisa spoke of the need to keep the letters short enough for a child to read , and selected topics explicitly with children in mind : “I started by writing about the war because at a certain stage in key stage two they do a project about the war , and the older girls had asked me , they had sort of interviewed me on the phone to help with their homework project questions , so I knew that the younger ones would at some stage be doing something about the war , so I wrote first of all my memories of the war . ” ( Lisa ) Thus memoirs were created on the one hand as a way of leaving a personal legacy , but on the other hand were shaped by the perceived wishes and needs of their intended audience . Leaving a legacy . Thus we find a blurring between conveying what is personally important , the need to pass on what is important in the context of family , and the wish to forge and enrich current family relationships . These three non - mutually exclusive values tie into the fact that memoirs were expected to be a vehicle for ‘passing on’ memories that would otherwise be lost , and doing the work of parenting and grandparenting when this could no longer be done . If children or grandchildren were not presently interested in the history of their family or the formative experiences of their grandparents , recording these could preserve them for later . Indeed , in some cases , the need to write was explicitly linked to a sense of mortality and the notion of being remembered in a particular way . Nicola described how “I wasn’t always fat like this , you know” , and noted that she wanted “to edit it , I want to be in control of it , don’t I ? ” . The motivation to write was associated with a clear sense of “leaving something” ( Rosie ) . Nicola also commented : - 14 - “Because I’ll probably have another stroke . I’ve had strokes , so this is on the cards , whatever I do . You know ? I’m two things , one blindness and one strokes . Both in the family , my mother’s side of the family . So I feel I have to get something down before that happens . ” Evidently though , being remembered requires someone to do the remembering . For the participants we interviewed , memoirs were written with family in mind ( Steven had also called his documents ‘Granddad’s Memoirs’ ) and were created as a way of engaging that audience . We have already noted Lisa’s tailoring of the content of her memoirs to her grandchildren , and this was seen widely ; for example , Eugene and Rosie ( who were married to one another ) were open to the idea of creating a spoken record in the form of an interview with their children , so as to allow their offspring to select the topics of interest . Eugene commented , “the important thing is to find out what your offspring wants from it all . . it’s no use to ourselves so much . We might occasionally look at it but it’s something , as it were , for posterity” . These records were documents to engage , and sustain a relationship with , one’s children and grandchildren . 6 . OVERARCHING THEMES AND DESIGN OPPORTUNITIES In this section , we consider four broad themes that emerged in the grounded theory analysis of accounts of the practices described above , and use them as a starting point to consider opportunities for design . We consider how memory was used as a resource for both personal and family action , and how meaning making in the future may be built upon a sense of identifying the characteristics of this family from a wider body of information . First , we explore in more depth the process of alteration that was bound up with preservation of archives . 6 . 1 Preserving Archives through the Process of Change Implicit in participants’ accounts of their archiving practices was the notion of a ‘core’ , singular archive , which was understood as a constant and passed from family member to family member . However , as we have noted , archives were not held constant . The obligations of the family archivist were tied to the alteration of content , in order to keep it accessible and relevant to future generations who would not otherwise find it meaningful . This included digitising archived materials and adding semantic metadata known only to older generations of the family . Thus , a view of archiving in the context of extended family needs to position preservation as bound up with change , rather than through the fixing of content . This suggests that there is considerable value in designing malleability into archived materials . Indeed , Odom et al . ( in press ) suggest that ‘tending’ to digital heirlooms could form part of the moral work of ensuring their safekeeping , and Banks ( 2011 ) notes that layering annotations onto digital content over time could be a means of enriching heirlooms . There is good reason to suppose that , in the context of an archive for extended family , associating these annotations with particular family members could add further meaning to the archive . Kirk and Sellen ( 2010 ) provide examples of the evocative nature of handwritten notes that augment inherited artefacts ( e . g . in the case of a recipe book ) , and digital materials could be designed to support prominent and personal annotations , allowing family members to leave their ( digital ) - 15 - mark . Indeed , Odom et al . ( 2011 ) suggest that media on social networking sites acquire a ‘digital patina’ through the comments and tags that they acquire , and such a model could also be applied in an archiving context , allowing family members to tag and comment on content , resulting in a richer tapestry of information . While alteration of content to support meaningfulness was part of the ‘work’ of the family archivist , repurposing archived materials in personal projects was not necessarily permissible . Housing an archive did not imply the right to do as one wished with it , and this was made explicit when aspects of an archive were to be modified or used in some creative project . For example , when Lisa planned to create an edited collection of her parents’ letters , she “consulted my sisters” . This contrasts with Edward’s creation of a manuscript from his own letters , and the importance of control over one’s own legacy that was expressed in relation to writing one’s own memoirs . There is a distinction here between ‘family’ and ‘personal’ content ; indeed , memories were talked about as things that one ‘had’ , owned , and could pass on to others ( “I have some actual memories of the war” , Lisa ) . We argue against explicating ‘permissions’ in relation to archived digital materials ; it seems that this is best negotiated between family members . However , a means of undoing actions and demarcating boundaries does seem essential . Kirk et al . ( 2010 ) note tensions regarding who had the right , and competence , to manage content within their Family Archive systems during a field deployment , and in this study we saw Steven disassociate himself from an extended family member to preserve the perceived accuracy of his family tree . We suggest that the possibility to demarcate boundaries and retain control over one’s own content becomes increasingly important in an extended family context , as materials spread wider and become less meaningful . It is tempting to build on the metaphor of a core archive expressed above , and suggest that digital archives should follow the model of a container for heterogeneous materials . Indeed , the idea of a single , standalone system underpins various family archiving systems within HCI , including the Living Memory Box ( Stevens et al . , 2003 ) and the Family Archive ( Kirk et al . , 2010 ) . However , a second characteristic of ‘the archives’ we encountered here was the blurriness of their boundaries . They were added to when family members passed away or ‘new’ family members discovered , and new content could be incorporated and also rejected if it was felt to be inaccurate . Further , archives were interleaved with other content , including that hosted online such as on genealogy websites , and that dispersed within the home . Finally , efforts were made to duplicate them , as a way of making content accessible to multiple future branches of the family . This suggests that creating digital links between an array of artefacts might better support the idea of a “family archive” than a standalone system that serves as some form of container . Further , these links might be sustained across a family network ; for example , multiple CDs containing scanned pictures could all be linked to the photo album from which they came . Duplication and annotation would then support the development of unique family narratives for each branch of the family , but also allow these to be drawn back together and potentially enable the making of new discoveries in the future , in the same way that family trees allowed participants to find ‘new’ family members . Banks ( 2011 ) points to Tales of Things ( a means of linking objects directly to ‘video memories’ stored online ) and BookCrossing ( a service that allows people to - 16 - follow the location of books that are ‘released’ , as they change hands from reader to reader ) as examples of how such digital links might be used in practice . 6 . 2 Memory as a Resource for Personal Action Findings from this study suggest that the past is , one the one hand , bound up with individuality ; talking about personal memories conveys character and allows a focus on formative events . On the other hand , the past is a resource for social action ; it is drawn upon to underpin bonds with family , both in the present and in the future . We might then conceptualise memory as a resource for both personal and family action and , following Sellen and Whittaker ( 2010 ) and van den Hoven and Eggen ( 2008 ) , consider the ‘benefits’ or ‘functions’ that technology could provide in either case . In this section we consider memory as a resource for personal action , in terms of firstly , allowing one to construct a sense of one’s own history , and secondly , underpinning reflection on personal experience . Where memory was explicitly noted as being ‘personal’ was in the writing of memoirs . Here there was a sense that reliance on memory , as opposed to use of source material , could enable one to construct a personal history , focusing on what is understood to be interesting or formative with hindsight , and allowing one to put across one’s one account . This type of reminiscing resonates with accounts of personal memory that position memory as constructed in relation to ‘the self’ ( Conway and Pleydell - Pearce , 2000 ) , and momentous events as being retrospectively causal ( Pillemer , 1998 ) . If one is expressing an account of the past , support for the formation of narrative , rather than specific attempts to cue memory , may be of most benefit . Indeed , van den Hoven and Eggen ( 2009 ) note that providing cues to memory can restrict narratives about the past , rather than encourage detailed accounts . However , in the same way that CIRCA ( Alm et al . , 2004 ) , Multimedia Biographies ( Damianakis et al . 2009 , Smith et al . , 2009 ) and Biography Theatre ( Massimi et al . , 2008 ) enable persons with cognitive impairments to draw on the past by creating a space to do so , so might technologies be designed to create a space for remembering and reflection . Spence’s ( 1997 ) guide to writing one’s personal history presents general questions as prompts to writing ( such as ‘Tell about a time when someone was there for you when you needed them’ , p . 56 ) , and in this study , Katie wrote a ‘reflection’ chapter as part of her memoirs . This approach has some similarities with the notion of engaging in a life review , a more structured form of reminiscing that has been argued to be associated with older age ( Butler , 1963 ) . Technologies to support writing , or simply reminiscing about the past , could take a related approach , encouraging recall of formative and memorable experiences , rather than cueing specific memories . This might be combined with templates that help underpin a narrative , in a manner akin to offering scrapbooking templates . The idea that memories are constructed rather than retrieved , coupled with the fact that remembering is guided by present ways of understanding ( Robinson , 1999 ) , has previously been noted as potentially problematic in the design of memory technologies . van den Hoven and Eggen ( 2008 ) have suggested that it may be disadvantageous to present information that contrasts with how events are remembered , and have argued that systems should not position records as offering a sole or ‘correct’ account of events . - 17 - However , here we posit that this difference between events as recorded and events as remembered could provide an interesting set of opportunities to design for reflection . Work by Harper et al . ( 2008 ) and Lindley et al . ( 2011 ) has shown that viewing photos taken whilst wearing a SenseCam provides a different perspective on the past , and in so doing can underpin reflection on personal experience . In this study , we also saw examples of how memoir writing and dealing with archived materials enabled the reaching of new understandings of the past . Lisa noted that reading her parents’ letters had helped her know the younger people they had been , as well as refreshing her own memory of what they had been like when she was younger , and Katie highlighted the iteration associated with writing her memoirs as allowing her to reach new understandings of herself : “Then I started looking through from a more scholarly , grammatical point of view , and trying to get some structure out of it . And so I was reading it more objectively then , and that ' s when I started to see , ah that ' s why I do that . [ laughs ] That’s why I ' ve always wanted to do that , and it all started to , well not all started to fit into place , but a lot of things started to fit in place then because I could see where they ' d come from . ” Technologies such as cameras place an emphasis on capturing what is felt to be important , or photoworthy ( Van House et al . , 2005 ) at the time , and ‘conversational’ photos ( Frohlich , 2004 ) offer a means of revisiting the meanings previously associated with photos , by capturing the conversations that have unfolded around them . Technologies like these this provide a way of revisiting past understandings , which may contrast in interesting ways to one’s current perspective . Thus , we suggest that ways of revisiting the past from different perspectives , if done sensitively , can underpin reflection and enable new understandings to be reached . 6 . 3 Memory as a Resource for Family Action The above points to the role of memory in underpinning the construction of one’s own personal history and reflection on past experience . However , in this study we have also seen how archives , memoirs and artefacts created from archived materials have relational qualities . They are produced to be shared with specific others , namely family members , and their form and content is shaped with that audience in mind . This tailoring to one’s audience resonates with the idea of memory as co - constructed and mediated by family ( e . g . Hirst and Manier , 1999 ; Webster et al . , 2010 ) . Morgan ( 1996 ) has argued that “Part of what family living means is the sharing , not necessarily harmoniously or consensually , of memories … they . . constitute or reconstitute themselves in the process . ” ( p . 144 ) . We can build on this argument here , noting that through recording their memoirs and repurposing archived materials , participants were contributing to a wider family narrative . Finch and Mason ( 2000 ) take this argument further , suggesting that inheritance is a means through which family is constituted , providing an opportunity for ‘active parenting’ ( e . g . by dividing money equally between children ) , and for the enactment of relationships by bequeathing keepsakes to the ‘right’ people . Combining these ideas with findings from this study suggests an opportunity to design for ‘active grandparenting’ . - 18 - We have discussed how passing on family stories , and even enacting the tradition of storytelling , is bound up with grandparenting . Further , guides such as The Long Distance Grandmother ( Wasserman , 2001 ) point to a general interest in remote grandparenting , and the creation of artefacts to be read in the future seems similarly motivated ; in both cases the aim is to build a relationship when this cannot be done in the here and now . Wasserman suggests that by conveying the traditions of the past , a grandparent is weaving generations together , and providing not only stories , but also offering an expression of love . Guides to recording life stories also highlight the fact that some readers may not have known you ( Rosenbluth , 1997 ) , and suggest that the records that are created may provide the “next best thing to having a wise grandparent on call” ( p . 83 , Spence , 1997 ) . In this study , Lisa’s plan to turn her letters to her grandchildren into a book that could be used in the future is a nice example of how grandparenting might be done across space as well as time : “I’m not really doing it for them now , but I’m putting it on record . . I’m relating it to them now because I won’t be alive in the future , when there might be some more grandchildren and they won’t know me , but they can have the letters as well . ” Petrelli and Whittaker ( 2010 ) have suggested that digital conversations may provide a compelling means of revisiting the past , and Lisa’s efforts suggest that this can be successful in the context of grandparenting . However , the real opportunity here may be in achieving what participants in this study spent considerable time doing : producing standalone , accessible artefacts that convey a clear narrative . Drawing these out of digital archives automatically represents a considerable challenge , which is likely to require the involvement of a family member . As a final observation , memoirs occasionally highlighted a tension between one’s own version of events and that of others . This echoes Smith et al . ’s ( 2009 ) description of the creation of video life stories ( also noted to feature ‘rose - tinted glasses’ ) , and also Rosenbluth’s ( 1997 ) addressing of the question , ‘who has the right to tell a secret ? ’ However , our study does demonstrate that participants wanted to be able to tell their own version of events , and exercise control over their legacy . Memoirs were often produced in limited numbers , in printed form , and given to specific individuals ; their content , as well as their distribution , was carefully managed . Further , and in contrast to Finch and Mason ( 2000 ) , who report that grandchildren were rarely considered in matters of inheritance , here we see grandchildren cited as the intended recipients for memoirs , scrapbooks and collections of letters . By specifically publishing enough copies for the grandchildren , and naming memoirs with grandchildren specifically in mind , participants were demarcating the boundaries of ‘family’ as they saw it and exercising some control over their audience ( interestingly , friends were never cited as a potential audience for the artefacts that were created ) . In passing these artefacts on , the opportunity arises for that version of events to be incorporated into the wider ‘family history’ , or not . As Katie said of her memoirs , “the ownership is my daughters’ and I hope that they’ll pass them on to their partners and children , but that’s entirely up to them . ” We suggest that the production of digital memoirs and family artefacts might have similar rights ascribed as physical versions ; ownership can be passed on , but content cannot be easily edited or duplicated . - 19 - 6 . 4 Meaning in the Future : The Distinctive and the Mundane From their study of time capsules , Petrelli et al . ( 2009 ) conclude that supporting meaning - making is a central tenet in design for ‘future memories’ , and note that participants focused on providing a ‘sample of life’ , to support this at a later time . Content relating to the mundane was also found to be valuable in this study , with participants detailing everyday life in their memoirs as a way of offering context , and searching for photos of typical scenes to illustrate them . These participants , like Petrelli et al . ’s , were aiming to communicate with a future audience . In this context , designing for understanding , rather than memory , is key , and so detailing the mundane is important . As we have also noted , writing about one’s own memories often entailed an emphasis on the distinctive and formative : “It’s getting across how special it was . . I stayed up all night . . I went home , took off the red dress . . and worked all day . . I mean now it probably is a sort of in - thing to do . ” ( Nicola ) This example illustrates how what was then ‘normal’ is essential for the distinctive to be understood . Some participants deliberately included details of the mundane , for example Katie wrote about the games that she played , stating “I think that’s quite important for grandchildren today , because they don’t play the same games we did” . We suggest that , when designing technologies to support meaning making by a future audience , knowing what is ‘normal’ can serve as a backdrop to what is distinctive , and so support understanding . Interestingly though , distinctive patterns can also be seen when dealing with large volumes of information about mundane details . For example , occupations that different generations had in common were made evident through family trees ( “All her side seem to work on the railways” , Steven ) and participants noted family resemblances in photos ( “he is just like his Dad , his Dad whenever his photo taken would put his hand up in the air” , Steven ) . Such abstractions seem to underscore a sense of the qualities that characterise this family . The possibility to abstract across large volumes of data could become increasingly important as technologies that capture details of the everyday become adopted . Shifts in technologies have had huge ramifications for what is considered photoworthy ( Van House et al . , 2005 ) , with people taking increasing numbers of digital photos . Further , and as discussed by Banks ( 2011 ) , a range of other services that support social networking and location tracking could potentially produce information that could be looked back on . Creating meaning out of such large collections may well rely on abstracting across them . Drawing out high - level patterns , emphasising family resemblances , and highlighting information that pertains to the present day ( e . g . known places or shops that are still in business ) , could enable meaning to be made out of such collections . This might be done by applying pattern recognition technologies to sets of family photos , matching location tags to places that current generations are familiar with , or using content found online to illustrate how places have changed over time . - 20 - 7 . CONCLUSION Researchers in HCI have explored the topic of memory through avenues as diverse as how it is called upon in the telling of stories , how it can be triggered by objects ranging from the mundane to the poignant , and how it is associated with reflection and reminiscing with others . Implicit in much of this work is the notion that memories are personal , precious and worthy of preservation , but little has been done to explore what it means to ‘capture’ memories for the future ( although we have noted contributions by Petrelli et al . ( 2000 ) and Sandhaus et al . ( 2010 ) ) . In this paper we have explored various activities that people undertake with the intention of ‘recording their memories for posterity’ , focusing in particular on dealing with inherited family archives , the creation of new artefacts out of repurposed archived materials , and recording memoirs . We have seen that memory can be considered a resource for ‘personal’ action in the context of these activities ; events as remembered are drawn upon in constructing a sense of one’s history , and revisiting the past from a different perspective can underpin personal reflection and the making of new meanings . However , we have also noted a tension between memory as ‘personal’ and memory ‘for family’ . The activities that our participants reported , although drawing on personal memory , were heavily influenced by a desire to make their accounts accessible and relevant to a specific audience : family . The tending to , and crafting of , these materials can be understood as a means of creating a ‘joint’ past and reinforcing a wider family narrative . In conclusion , while this practice drew heavily on a ‘personal’ past , it was future - facing . It was a means of making the past a resource for action in future family life . - 21 - NOTES Acknowledgments .
