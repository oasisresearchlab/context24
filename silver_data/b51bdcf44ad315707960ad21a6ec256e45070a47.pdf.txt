The HIV - 1 accessory protein Nef hijacks clathrin adaptors to degrade or mislocalize host proteins involved in antiviral defenses . Here , we investigate the interaction between Nef and clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , a major pathway for membrane protein internalization in mammalian cells , using quantitative live - cell microscopy in genome - edited Jurkat cells . Nef is recruited to CME sites on the plasma membrane , and this recruitment correlates with an increase in the recruitment and lifetime of CME coat protein AP - 2 and late - arriving CME protein dynamin2 . Furthermore , we find that CME sites that recruit Nef are more likely to recruit dynamin2 , suggesting that Nef recruitment to CME sites promotes CME site maturation to ensure high efficiency in host protein downregulation . Introduction Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) depends on accessory viral proteins for its efficient replication and spread ( Collins & Collins , 2014 ) . HIV accessory proteins , including Nef , Vpu , Vif , Vpr , and Vpx , counteract host defenses by redirecting cellular pathways for the benefit of the virus ( Collins & Collins , 2014 ; Malim & Bieniasz , 2012 ) . Here , we focus on the protein Nef , a non - enzymatic accessory protein encoded in the HIV genome ( Allan et al . , 1985 ) . A major function of Nef is to downregulate host transmembrane proteins involved in antiviral restriction and immune response by modulating the trafficking routes of these membrane proteins ( Pereira & daSilva , 2016 ; Buffalo , Iwamoto , et al . , 2019 ) . HIV - 1 Nef downregulates specific host proteins , including CD3 , CD4 , CD28 , MHC - I and SERINC5 , by acting as an adaptor to physically bridge the target protein with the AP - 1 and AP - 2 adaptor complexes ( Pereira & daSilva , 2016 ; Buffalo , Iwamoto , et al . , 2019 ) . The activities of Nef include internalizing surface proteins from the plasma membrane by clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , directing membrane proteins to lysosomal compartments for degradation , and sequestering membrane proteins at the Golgi ( Pereira & daSilva , 2016 ; Buffalo , Iwamoto , et al . , 2019 ) . Nef function in the host cell is relatively well understood in a qualitative sense . While advances in live - cell imaging have made it possible to quantitatively follow CME with a high level of spatial and temporal precision ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ; Mettlen et al . , 2018 ; Dambournet et al . , 2018 ; Pedersen et al . , 2020 ) , these powerful techniques have yet to be deployed to the study of Nef . Studies described here focus on Nef’s interaction with the clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) pathway , the major pathway for plasma membrane protein internalization in mammalian cells ( Bitsikas et al . , 2014 ) . Nef has been shown to downregulate the CD4 receptor ( Guy et al . , 1987 ; Inoue et al . , 1993 ; Aiken et al . , 1994 ) and the restriction factors SERINC3 / 5 ( Usami et al . , 2015 ; Rosa et al . , 2015 ) and tetherin ( in SIV but not HIV ) ( Zhang et al . , 2009 ; Jia et al . , 2009 ; Serra - Moreno et al . , 2013 ) , from the plasma membrane in a CME - dependent manner . AP - 2 , the major adaptor complex for CME ( Jackson , COSB 2012 ; Traub & Bonifacino , CSHL 2013 ) , is required for Nef downregulation of target proteins . Nef binds to AP - 2 directly through a dileucine motif in a flexible disordered loop ( Ren et al . , 2014 ) . In addition , structures of Nef complexed with AP - 2 and the Nef - binding cytosolic tail of downregulated host factors have been solved ( Buffalo , Sturzel , et al . , 2019 ; Kwon et al . , 2020 ) . In cells , colocalization of clathrin / AP - 2 , Nef , and Nef - downregulated host factors has been reported through live - cell and immunofluorescence microscopy , and was found to be dependent on a Nef dileucine motif ( Greenberg et al . , 1997 ; Greenberg et al . , 1998 ; Burtey et al . , 2007 ) . Clathrin and Nef dynamics have been visualized in HeLa cells , where Nef was shown to be internalized from the plasma membrane together with clathrin ( Burtey et al . , 2007 ) . These findings support a model in which Nef interacts with AP - 2 to recruit its target proteins to CME sites for internalization from the plasma membrane . However , the quantitative details of how Nef affects CME dynamics , and how efficiently Nef recruits its target proteins to CME sites , have yet to be investigated in a living , physiologically relevant cell line . Such an analysis promises to provide novel insights into the mechanism of Nef action in CME . In this study , we employ Jurkat cells , which are immortalized human T cells ( Schwenk & Schneider , 1975 ; Abraham & Weiss , 2004 ) , that were genome - edited to express fluorescent protein - tagged CME proteins AP - 2 ( AP2M1 ) and dynamin 2 ( DNM2 ) at endogenous levels for faithful investigation of CME dynamics through live - cell microscopy . We selected the HIV - 1 NA7 Nef patient isolate because it has been shown to potently promote CD4 internalization ( Mariani & Skowronski , 1993 ; Mariani et al . , 1996 ) . Our quantitative analysis of CME dynamics revealed Nef - dependent changes in CME dynamics . Lastly , productivity of CME sites with or without Nef recruitment was assessed , revealing a Nef enhancement of the efficiency of target downregulation through the CME pathway . Results CME dynamics in genome - edited Jurkat cells HIV Nef causes several different cell surface host factors to be removed from the cell surface by CME , but whether Nef affects CME dynamics is not known . To develop a cell line that would allow us to investigate whether HIV Nef affects CME dynamics , we genome - edited Jurkat cells , a T - cell leukemia cell line that resembles natural HIV hosts ( Schwenk & Schneider , 1975 ; Abraham & Weiss , 2004 ) . The resulting line expresses fluorescent protein - tagged endocytic proteins at endogenous levels . These cells were engineered to express the endocytic adapter protein AP - 2 labeled with tagRFPt , and the late arriving scission factor dynamin 2 ( DNM2 ) labeled with EGFP ( Figure S1A and S1B ) ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ; Hong et al . , 2015 ) . AP - 2 is both the direct target of Nef and an established marker for clathrin - coat assembly ( Boucrot et al . , 2010 ; Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) . DNM2 serves as marker for vesicle scission ( Grassart et al . , 2014 ; Cocucci et al . , 2014 ; Antonny et al . , 2016 ; Merrifield et al . , 2002 ) ( Figure S1F ) . Two imaging modalities were used to observe CME and Nef . The first was TIRF microscopy , which allows quantitative and sensitive imaging within ~ 250 nm of the cell - substrate interface , facilitating the selective visualization of CME at a cell’s basal membrane ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ) . However , CME dynamics at the cell - substrate interface could be affected by factors such as substrate adhesion and membrane tension ( Batchelder & Yarar , 2010 ) . To measure CME at non - adhered surfaces , we also employed a complementary imaging method , HiLo microscopy ( Tokunaga et al . , 2008 ) , to image the medial focal plane of cells , similar to what is done commonly with yeast ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . We opted for HiLo microscopy over conventional confocal microscopy for this purpose due to the high signal - to - noise ratio and low photobleaching offered by the method ( Tokunaga et al . , 2008 ) . Together , these two imaging modalities allowed us to quantitatively analyze CME dynamics in Jurkat cells . As in other cell types analyzed previously , AP - 2 and DNM2 colocalized at cortical endocytic patches ( Figure 1A and 1C ) . Nef is specifically recruited to CME sites in Jurkat cells Nef contains an AP - 2 - binding dileucine motif shown previously by both live cell imaging and fixed - cell immunostaining to be required for efficient recruitment to CME sites ( Greenberg et al . , 1997 ; Burtey et al . , 2007 ) . To test whether this motif is also required for Nef recruitment to CME sites in Jurkat cells , we transfected the genome - edited Jurkat cells with either WT Nef or the dileucine motif LLAA mutant Nef . To examine Nef recruitment at the membrane , Nef localization was assessed through both TIRF and HiLo microscopy ( Figure 1A and 1C , Movie 2 - 5 ) . TIRF microscopy results indicated that WT Nef shows 31  15 % colocalization with AP - 2 while LLAA Nef shows only 9 + / - 5 % colocalization ( Figure 1B ) . Random colocalization between Nef and AP - 2 was estimated by rotating the AP - 2 image 90 degrees and quantifying colocalization with its corresponding Nef image . Both WT and LLAA Nef show greater colocalization in non - rotated images compared to random colocalization in the rotated images ( Figure 1B ) . For CME events on the portion of membrane not attached to the cover glass , WT Nef colocalized with AP - 2 23  30 % of the time while LLAA Nef only colocalized with AP - 2 8  17 % of the time ( Figure 1D ) . The measured colocalization value for Nef and AP - 2 was lower when assessed by HiLo microscopy on the portion of membrane not attached to the cover glass due to their lower fraction of persistent AP - 2 events ( Figure 1E ) . Persistent AP - 2 events , lasting throughout the entire 5 minute movie , was mostly only present in TIRF movies and exhibited increased dileucine dependent colocalization with Nef at a much higher 60  31 % ( Figure 1F ) . Both approaches confirm that Nef localizes to CME sites in a dileucine motif - dependent manner across all of the plasma membrane . Furthermore , these results suggest that Nef localization to CME sites is affected by contact between substrate and the plasma membrane , since increased colocalization between Nef and AP - 2 was observed at persistent AP - 2 events on the portion of membrane attached to the cover glass . Unexpectedly , we also observed Nef and AP - 2 colocalization at intracellular structures . These structures likely reflect at least two types of Nef - AP - 2 interactions . Some such structures appear to be recently internalized clathrin - coated vesicles that have not been uncoated , since we were able to observe Nef and AP - 2 internalize from plasma membrane together after DNM2 disassembly ( Figure S2A ) . Intracellular structures exhibiting Nef - AP - 2 colocalization were also observed in cells expressing LLAA Nef ( Figure S2B ) . The nature of this second class of structure is presently unknown and may represent interactions between AP - 2 and one of several organelles that recruit Nef ( Pereira & daSilva , 2016 ) . Nef recruitment increases AP - 2 lifetime at CME sites We classified CME events into three categories . The control category represents CME dynamics measured in untransfected AP - 2 - RFP DNM2 - GFP Jurkat cells . The Nef + and Nef - categories refer to CME sites in Nef expressing cells that do and do not recruit Nef , respectively . Since substrate adhesion may alter CME dynamics , we chose to first analyze the effect of Nef on CME dynamics via HiLo microscopy . To quantify CME dynamics at many CME sites , we generated kymographs around the circumference of these imaged through their medial focal planes ( Figure 2A right ) . We quantified the lifetime that the fluorescent proteins resided on the cell periphery by measuring the length of each endocytic event on these kymographs ( Figure 2A left ) . The lifetime analysis revealed that CME sites in untransfected cells or at sites of transfected cells that lack detectable Nef exhibited similar AP - 2 lifetimes of 66  21 and 64  19 seconds , respectively , while Nef + CME sites exhibited longer AP - 2 lifetimes averaging 87  23 seconds ( Figure 2B ) . The LLAA Nef + and Nef - CME sites displayed very similar lifetimes of 66  28 and 65  24 seconds , respectively , showing no statistically significant change in AP - 2 lifetime correlated with Nef recruitment . These results show that recruitment of WT Nef to a CME site increases its lifetime . Increased AP - 2 and DNM2 recruitment and lifetimes observed at Nef - positive CME sites by TIRF microscopy We turned to TIRF imaging for higher throughput lifetime and intensity analysis . We validated our analysis pipeline for CME events and Nef colocalization in TIRF movies by confirming that the analysis reported a similar amount of colocalization between WT Nef and AP - 2 at dynamic CME sites as seen through HiLo microscopy , while exhibiting reduced colocalization between LLAA Nef and AP - 2 ( Figure S3A ) . We focused our analysis on dynamic events since persistent events were not often seen on the portion of membrane not attached to the cover glass . We determined that 15 % of basal CME sites were Nef positive in WT Nef transfected cells , while only 1 . 6 % were Nef positive in LLAA Nef transfected cells . The Nef positive events in LLAA showed reduced Nef lifetime and recruitment ( Figure S3B and S3C ) . We further improved our approach by stably integrating an inducible form of HIV - Nef - HALO into the genome - engineered Jurkat cells to gain control over the duration and amount of Nef expression ( Figure 3A , Figure S5 , Movie 6 ) . We chose to analyze the effects of Nef on CME dynamics by inducing Nef expression for four hours , which was the earliest time point that showed marked increase in Nef expression levels by fluorescence microscopy compared to uninduced cells ( Figure S4A and S4D ) . We first reproduced results from HiLo imaging that CME sites that recruit Nef exhibit increased AP - 2 lifetimes ( Figure 3C ) . Control CME sites had an AP - 2 lifetime of 72  40 seconds , Nef negative sites had an AP - 2 lifetime of 68  37 seconds , and Nef positive sites showed an increased AP - 2 lifetime of 105  51 seconds . Additionally , Nef positive CME sites showed increased AP - 2 recruitment compared to Nef negative and control CME sites ( control 586 . 7  439 . 1 au , Nef - 588 . 7  470 . 4 au , Nef + 877 . 2  536 . 4 au ) ( Figure 3D ) . LLAA Nef + sites showed little to no change compared to control or LLAA Nef - CME sites in AP - 2 lifetime and recruitment ( Figure S3D and S3E ) . Interestingly , similar increases in lifetime and recruitment at Nef + sites were also observed for DNM2 ( Figure 3E and 3F ) . Next we determined the dynamics of Nef at CME sites ( Figure 3B and 3G ) . Kymograph analysis from both HiLo and TIRF images showed that Nef tends to be recruited to CME sites shortly after AP - 2 , and persists until AP - 2 disappears ( Figure 2A and 3B ) . The cohort plot for CME also qualitatively matched the observations from the kymographs ( Figure 3G ) . The AP - 2 and DNM2 intensity profiles matched those of other cell lines ( Hong et al . , 2015 ; Dambournet et al . , 2018 ) . The intensity changes of Nef closely matched those of AP - 2 , further supporting the model that Nef affects CME through AP - 2 interaction . Nef lifetime was measured to be 45  30 seconds ( Figure 3H ) . In summary , Nef + sites show increased AP - 2 and DNM2 recruitment and lifetime . Neither the number of Nef molecules at a CME site nor the total expression induction time predict AP - 2 lifetime or amount To gain further insight into how Nef affects CME dynamics , we asked whether the amount of Nef recruited to a CME site predicts the magnitude of the observed phenotypes . Using the Nef inducible cell line , Nef expression was induced for 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , and 24h to vary the amount of Nef recruitment to CME sites . Nef expression increased with longer induction time ( Figure S4A and S4B ) , as did the amount of Nef recruited to Nef positive sites and the percent of Nef positive sites ( Figure S4C and S4D ) . However , there was no detectable difference in the magnitude of AP - 2 lifetime or AP - 2 amount recruited at different times of Nef induction ( Figure S4E and S4F ) . These results suggest that the threshold for the full effect of Nef recruitment on CME site lifetime is low . Nef positive CME sites show increased productivity Previous studies concluded that to varying degrees in different cell types , initiated CME events do not always proceed to productive vesicle formation . Characteristics of productive CME events include longer AP - 2 lifetimes , higher AP - 2 recruitment levels , and DNM2 recruitment in a sharp peak just before its disappearance ( Loerke et al . , 2009 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ; Hong et al . , 2015 ; Aguet et al . , 2013 ; Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ) . We sought to determine whether the effects of Nef on CME protein recruitment levels and lifetime might reflect increased productivity of Nef + CME events . One distinguishing feature of non - productive , or abortive , CME events is that their AP - 2 lifetimes are often less than ~ 20 seconds in length ( Hong et al . , 2015 ) . Another is that CME events that are not completed fail to recruit DNM2 in a sharp peak prior to site disappearance . To this end , we first analyzed differences in AP - 2 lifetimes of Nef + and Nef - events through generation of histograms for all CME events , regardless of whether these events recruited DNM2 ( Figure 4A ) . Strikingly , the histogram for Nef - events reveals predominantly short - lived AP - 2 events , while the histogram for Nef + events reveals a much larger fraction of CME events with longer AP - 2 lifetimes . Such short - lived CME events have been attributed to abortive events that do not recruit late - arriving endocytic factors such as DNM2 and GAK / Auxilin , which mark vesicle scission and uncoating , respectively ( Loerke et al . , 2009 ; Aguet et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ; He et al . , 2020 ) . Furthermore , control CME events showed a similar AP - 2 lifetime distribution as Nef - events , while LLAA Nef + events showed an intermediate AP - 2 lifetime distribution ( Figure 4B ) . Together , these observations indicate Nef + events are much less likely to exhibit reduced AP - 2 lifetimes , and that this effect is partially dependent on the interaction between Nef and AP - 2 . If Nef is involved in determining CME site productivity , we reasoned that it should arrive at CME sites within the lifetime of abortive events . We determined that , on average , Nef is recruited around 18 seconds after AP - 2 in Nef + events . Since early recruitment of DNM2 has also been proposed to serve as a checkpoint in determining CME productivity , we measured the arrival of DNM2 in relation to AP - 2 to further probe whether Nef is recruited at a sufficiently early time to influence CME productivity ( Loerke et al . , 2009 ) . DNM2 was detected 26 seconds after AP - 2 on average for Nef + sites ( Figure 3I ) . Thus , Nef is recruited during a time window when it could influence CME site productivity ( Loerke et al . , 2009 ; Aguet et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , we assessed the productivity of Nef + events by comparing the fraction of Nef + events that recruited DNM2 to the Nef - and control events that recruited DNM2 . DNM2 was recruited to 78 % of Nef + events and only 31 % and 23 % of control and Nef - events , respectively ( Figure 4C ) . DNM2 was recruited to 53 % of LLAA Nef + events , showing an intermediate value that is consistent with the intermediate value of the AP - 2 lifetime increase observed for LLAA Nef + events ( Figure 4C ) . This partial activity of LLAA Nef , along with the reduced but significant colocalization of LLAA Nef and AP - 2 ( Figure 1B ) , suggests that there might be additional factors of presently unknown identity that contribute to the interaction between Nef and CME machinery . In summary , these results suggest Nef + CME sites are more productive than control or Nef - sites , and are consistent with the possibility that Nef arrives at CME sites early to increase productivity in an AP - 2 dependent manner ( Figure 4D ) . Discussion Current literature supports a model in which HIV Nef downregulates CD4 , SERINC5 , and other membrane proteins from the cell surface by acting as an adaptor to connect AP - 2 to the target protein . Here , we closely examined the kinetic aspect of this model in a cell line that resembles the natural biological host of HIV and expresses endogenously tagged fluorescent derivatives of CME proteins AP - 2 and dynamin2 . Nef localized to CME sites in a dileucine motif - dependent manner in the genome - edited Jurkat cells , consistent with previous findings . We noticed that in the region of the plasma membrane that was not attached to the cover glass almost all CME sites were dynamic , appearing and disappearing . However , 7 % of CME events on regions of plasma membrane not attached to the cover glass persisted for the entirety of our 5 - minute movies . These persistent sites showed greatly increased Nef recruitment compared to dynamic sites . Together , these observations indicate that Nef recruitment to CME sites may be sensitive to contact between the infected - host cell and the extracellular environment . Additionally , we also observed colocalization between Nef and AP - 2 away from the plasma membrane , in the cell interior . Some of these structures appear to be newly released endocytic vesicles that have not yet been uncoated . However , colocalization was also observed to a similar degree when the Nef dileucine motif was mutated , suggesting that at least those colocalization events were not recently released clathrin - coated vesicles . Such interactions between clathrin - coated vesicles and Nef positive endosomal organelles might therefore represent a previously unappreciated site at which Nef can modulate cellular traffic . AP - 2 and dynamin2 lifetimes were greater at Nef positive CME sites compared to Nef negative sites in the same cells . Therefore , the increased lifetime appears to be a direct consequence of Nef presence at a CME site rather than to changes in the overall cellular environment . The upper limit of observed AP - 2 recruitment and lifetime was comparable across control , Nef - , and Nef + sites , suggesting that the magnitude of change in these parameters of Nef + CME sites could be restricted to a pre - existing range within the control CME population ( Figure S4E and S4F ) . While the upper end of the Nef effect on AP - 2 and dynamin2 recruitment and dynamics can be explained by constraints on the CME site , the lack of correlation between the amount of Nef recruited and AP - 2 recruitment / lifetime was unexpected . An intriguing possibility is that there is a local amplification of Nef effects at the CME site such that only a small amount of Nef is necessary to saturate the effect . Outside of its trafficking functions , Nef has been shown to modulate signaling through interaction with various kinases , such as activating Src family kinases through binding of Nef’s proline - rich domain to the negative regulatory SH3 domains of Src family kinases ( Saksela et al . , 1995 ) . On the other hand , Nef mutations in the proline rich domain involved in binding the SH3 domains of Src family kinases do not interfere with downregulation of CD4 through CME ( Saksela et al . , 1995 ) . Many CME proteins such as dynamin2 also interact through a multivalent SH3 and proline - rich domain network at the CME site , raising the possibility that the observed Nef - dependent changes might involve this network as well ( Li et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2017 ) . A third explanation for the lack of correlation between Nef levels and effects is the possibility that HIV Nef functions in a target sensitive manner . The closely related SIV Nef has been shown to form a tripartite complex consisting of the AP - 2 complex , the cytoplasmic tail of the target host protein , and itself . Whether the interaction between Nef and AP - 2 alone is sufficient to effect CME dynamics is not clear ( Buffalo , Sturzel , et al . , 2019 ; Kwon et al . , 2020 ) . A mixed population of target - bound Nef and target - free Nef can explain the lack of strong correlation between Nef’s levels and the magnitude of its effect on CME . Finally , we observed that Nef increases CME site productivity . Non - productive or abortive events are characterized by low accumulation of endocytic coat proteins and lack of late CME protein recruitment , such as the final burst of dynamin2 recruitment and subsequent arrival of uncoating factors ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Aguet et al . , 2013 ; Hong et al . , 2015 ; He et al . , 2020 ) . Here , we showed that Nef - positive CME sites have significantly increased AP - 2 lifetimes and recruitment levels , and are around 50 % more likely to recruit detectable dynamin2 in a late peak . The majority of Nef is recruited to CME sites within 18 seconds of AP - 2 recruitment , meaning that Nef is present within the lifetime of both abortive and productive events , the time window when it could influence CME site productivity . WT Nef - positive CME sites recruited more dynamin2 than LLAA Nef - positive CME sites , suggesting that the dileucine motif interaction between Nef and AP - 2 plays a role in regulating CME productivity . Importantly , the dileucine motif interaction between Nef and AP - 2 is similar to how some membrane receptors interact with AP - 2 to be internalized ( Ren et al . , 2014 ; Kelly et al . , 2008 ) . Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression or increase in local concentration of membrane proteins harboring the tyrosine motif , a different AP - 2 binding motif , can increase CME productivity ( Loerke et al . , 2009 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ; Kadlecova et al . , 2017 ) . An analogous mechanism where the Nef dileucine motif mimics membrane protein binding with AP - 2 might increase CME productivity . Intriguingly , it was reported that overexpression of tyrosine motif - containing membrane proteins can increase the nucleation of CME events while overexpression of dileucine motif harboring membrane proteins cannot ( Kadlecova et al . , 2017 ) . HIV Nef appears to have lost a tyrosine motif that is present in SIV Nef , and lacks the ability to downregulate CD3 from the cell surface via CME ( Manrique et al . , 2017 ) . The differences in how AP - 2 binding motifs influence CME dynamics and Nef target protein internalization may have played a role in Nef evolution . In conclusion , we report that Nef increases the recruitment and lifetimes of CME proteins AP - 2 and dynamin2 to CME sites . The effects of Nef on the AP - 2 protein recruitment and lifetime were dependent on the dileucine motif of Nef . Finally , we observed that Nef - positive CME sites exhibit increased productivity . Given these observations , we propose that Nef promotes membrane protein downregulation at least in part by increasing CME site productivity through AP - 2 stabilization . Methods Cloning . The donor vector for endogenously tagging the dynamin2 gene was generated by fusing the pCR8 backbone , 5’ DNM2 homology arm , GTSGGS linker , tagGFP2 , and 3’ DNM2 homology arm via Gibson assembly . The donor vector for endogenously tagging the AP2M1 gene was generated by fusing the pCR8 backbone , 5’ AP - 2 homology arm , GTSGGS linker , tagRFPt , GMDELYKASGSGT linker , and 3’ AP - 2 homology arm via Gibson assembly . Homology arms of genes were obtained from genomic PCR . NA7 - Nef - HALO was generated by fusing the pcDNA5 backbone with the codon - optimized coding sequence of the NA7 Nef ( protein ID : ABB51086 . 1 ) , SGGTG linker , and HALO tag via Gibson assembly . The pcDNA5 NA7 - Nef - HALO LLAA construct was generated by mutating L164 and L165 into alanines via site - directed mutagenesis from the pcDNA5 NA7 - Nef - HALO construct . The pInducer20 NA7 - Nef - HALO was generated by cloning the NA7 - Nef - HALO insert into the pENTR1A vector , followed by gateway assembly of the insert into the pInducer20 packaging vector ( Meerbrey et al . 2011 ) . Cell culture Experiments were conducted using Jurkat E6 - 1 cells , originally obtained from the UCB Cell Culture Facility . The cells were cultured in RPMI - 1640 Media supplemented with 10 % FBS , Pen - Strep , and Sodium Pyruvate and grown at 37°C and 5 % CO2 . Cells were maintained at densities below 2e6 cells / ml during passaging and experiments were conducted within 20 passages from the generation of the cell line . Stable cell lines inducibly expressing Nef were selected with G418 concentration of 800  g / ml and maintained with concentration of 400  g / ml . MDA - MB - 231 cells were cultured in DMEM F12 Glutamax supplemented with 10 % FBS and Pen - Strep .

The settings for the electroporation used were voltage of 180 , pulse length of 10ms , and single pulse . Genome editing Jurkat cells were genome - edited by electroporation of the Cas9 - crRNAtracrRNA complex using the Amaxa Nucleofector 2b electroporator . Donor vectors for genome - editing have homology arms ranging from 700 - 1000 bp , and were electroporated with the Cas9 complex . The gRNA sequence TTGCTTCCCGCTGCAAGCAG was used to target AP2M1 , and the gRNA sequence CCTGCTCGACTAGGCCTCGA was used to target DNM2 . Jurkat cells were cultured for 3 days after electroporation and sorted into 96 - well plates for clonal expansion using fluorescent signal to isolate edited clones using the BD Bioscience Influx sorter ( BD Bioscience ) . Both alleles of AP - 2 and one allele of DNM2 were tagged in the final cell line . The S . Pyogenes NLS - Cas9 was purified in the University of California Berkeley QB3 Macrolab . Sorting was conducted in the University of California Berkeley CRL flow cytometry facility . Lentiviral production and infection The pInducer20 - NA7 - Nef - Halo vector was packaged into lentiviruses in HEK293T cells by co - transfection with 2 nd generation lentiviral packaging plasmids ( Addgene 182993 and 244397 ) using TransIT - LT1 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Mirus 2304 ) . Viral supernatants were collected for 3 days and filtered through a 0 . 45μm PES filter . The collected supernatant was concentrated with LentiX concentrator following the manufacturer’s instructions ( Takara 631232 ) . The virus containing pellet was then resuspended in 1ml of the supernatant and stored in 100  l aliquots at - 80°C . To generate stable Jurkat cell lines , Jurkat cells were sub - cultured in a well of a 6 - well plate . An aliquot of the concentrated virus was directly pipetted into the well and cells were incubated with virus overnight . The following day , the media was replaced with media containing 800  g / ml G418 for selection . The infected Jurkat cells were selected in G418 for 2 weeks before use in experiments . After 2 weeks , the stable Jurkat cell lines were cultured in 400  g / ml G418 . Live - cell microscopy Jurkat cells were incubated with 100nM JF635 dye at least 1 hour prior to imaging if expressing or being compared to cell lines expressing HALO - tagged proteins . NA7 Nef expression was induced by treating cells with 0 . 1  g / ml Doxycycline for the desired duration . AP - 2 - RFP DNM2 - GFP and the uninduced AP - 2 - RFP DNM2 - GFP NA7 - Nef - HALO Jurkat cell lines were incubated with an equal volume of DMSO instead for 24 hours . All imaging was conducted on 8 well chambered glass slides ( Cellvis C8 - 1 . 5H - N ) , coated with 1mg / ml Poly - L - Lysine . Plates were coated for 10 min and washed 3 times with PBS . Jurkat cells were transferred to imaging media ( growth media without phenol red ) and allowed to adhere on the well for 10 minutes prior to imaging . Images were acquired through total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy using a Nikon Ecliplse Ti2 inverted microscope . The TIRF scope was equipped with a LUNF 4 - line laser launch ( Nikon Instruments ) and an iLas2 RING - TIRF module ( Gataca Systems ) . The CFI60 60x Apo TIRF objective and a Hamamatsu Orca Fusion Gen III sCMOS camera were used to capture images . All movies were acquired at 37°C sequentially over 5 min at 2 second intervals and 100ms exposure for each channel . The system was controlled with NIS - Elements software . For HiLo microscopy , Jurkat cells were prepared as described and the excitation laser was angled at 55 degrees . The plane chosen for imaging was the focal plane closest to the bottom of the coverslip where fluorescence from the bottom surface of the cell could not be observed . The incubation condition and other imaging parameters were the same as in TIRF . All datasets consist of three movies per condition per day , taken on three separate days . For Hilo imaging , at least 30 cells and 85 CME events were analyzed for each condition . For TIRF imaging , at least 39 cells were analyzed for each condition in transfection experiments . 2147 , 1074 , and 1356 CME events were analyzed in control , WT - NA7 expressing , and LLAA - NA7 - Nef expressing Jurkat cells , respectively . At least 141 cells were analyzed for each condition in induction experiments . 3010 , 4577 , 3332 , 2684 , 2611 , and 2510 CME events were analyzed in control , 0h , 2h , 4h , 6h , and 24h Nef induced Jurkat cells . Cell lysis and Western blot 1e6 – 2e6 Jurkat cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 24  l of lysis buffer , consisting of 50 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1 % NP40 , phosSTOP ( Roche 4906845001 ) , and protease inhibitor ( Roche 1183617001 ) . Cells were lysed for 15 minutes on ice with gentle agitation every 5 minutes . Lysed cells were then centrifuged at 4°C and 13 , 000rpm for 15 minutes . 18  l of the supernatant was collected as lysate . The lysate was mixed with Laemmeli reducing buffer with 5 % β - mercaptoethanol . 10  l of the final solution was loaded onto a 10 % acrylamide gel for SDS - PAGE analysis . Proteins resolved on the SDS - PAGE gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting via wet transfer . Blots were blocked with 5 % milk in tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) and incubated with primary antibody . The antibodies used for western blotting were : anti - HALO ( 1 : 1000 in 0 . 5 % milk TBST , 4°C o / n , Promega G9211 ) , anti - GAPDH ( 1 : 10000 in TBST , RT 1 hr , ab9485 ) , anti - AP - 2M1 ( 1 : 500 in 0 . 5 % milk TBST , 4°C o / n , Abcam , ab75995 ) , and anti - Tag ( CGY ) FP ( 1 : 2000 in 0 . 5 % milk TBST , 4°C o / n , Evrogen AB121 ) . Blots were then incubated with IRDye 800 / 680 conjugated antibodies ( 1 : 10000 in 5 % milk TBST , RT 1hr , 926 - 32212 926 - 68071 ) and imaged on the LICOR Odyssey scanner . Image Processing Prior to kymograph and colocalization analysis through imageJ , images were background subtracted ( subtract mean value of box outside cell from all pixels ) , corrected for photobleaching if applicable ( Fiji bleach correction , exponential fitting method ) , and cytoplasmic background subtracted ( Median filter , r = 6px , was subtracted from image ) to clearly visualize punctate structures . Kymograph Analysis of endocytic events To create kymographs of mid - focal plane imaging movies an average intensity Z - projection of these movies was generated and a drawing a 20 pixel wide line around circumference of cells . Intensity change of the movie within the line was projected across time . Lifetime measurements were made by drawing a horizontal line over the observed CME events in imageJ and measuring its length . The beginning and end of events were determined by when intensity levels were at least 3x background levels . Events were categorized as persistent if the AP - 2 signal was present throughout the entire 5 minute movie . Events were categorized as dynamic if the AP - 2 signal appeared and disappeared within the 5 minute movie . Colocalization Analysis Colocalization was evaluated using three different methods . For HiLo images , colocalization was manually assessed through kymograph analysis . For TIRF images , colocalization analysis for all events was conducted through imageJ . Individual cells were segmented into square regions and separately assessed for colocalization . After processing , average intensity projections were generated for each channel . Masks for punctate structures were generated using the imageJ “Find Maxima” function ( prominence setting of 10 , with tolerance ) . The pixel overlap of the resulting masks was assessed for pairs of channels to test for colocalization . As a negative control , the mask generated from the AP - 2 coat channel was rotated 90 degrees and compared to masks from other channels , establishing a baseline for chance colocalization . Particle tracking analysis For particle tracking analysis , cells were cropped individually and separated into cell specific folders for analysis using the cmeAnalysis MATLAB package . For tracking , gaussian PSF model fitting detection with a gap length of 2 , tracking minimum radius of 3 , and tracking maximum radius of 6 . Tracks that showed an AP - 2 lifetime greater than 20 seconds , mean squared displacement < 0 . 02μm 2 , and at least 3 consecutive significant ( pval < 0 . 01 ) detections of DNM2 were considered valid tracks . Tracks that showed at least 4 consecutive significant ( pval < 1e - 25 ) detections of Nef that averaged within < 1 . 25 pixels away from AP - 2 were considered to be Nef positive tracks . These parameters for assessing Nef colocalization were determined by manually examining montages of detected Nef colocalization events , and by comparing the number of detected Nef positive events in WT Nef and LLAA Nef transfected samples . Dynamic events and persistent events were filtered by analyzing category 1 and 4 tracks in the CME analysis software , respectively . Lifetimes of DNM2 and Nef were calculated with a tolerable gap length of 2 . For figure 4 , tracks were considered to be DNM2 positive if there were at least 3 consecutive significant detections of DNM2 as well as a DNM2 maximum intensity higher than the 75th percentile of CME events that are shorter than 20 seconds . Scripts used for imaging analysis ( Code Availability ) All user - made scripts for imageJ , MATLAB , and python can be accessed here : https : / / github . com / yuichiro - iwamoto / Nef - CME - analysis Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed by using the python package sciPy or with Prism 9 . Non - parametric statistical tests were used to evaluate significance so no assumption about data distributions were made . Specifically , Mann Whitney U test was used to evaluate significance of two groups and the Kruskal - Wallis test was used to evaluate significance when multiple comparisons were made . Data were visualized using the python package seaborn and Prism 9 . All reported values are indicated as mean  standard deviation .

Points represent fraction of events that recruit DNM2 from separate biological replicates . D . Model for how Nef recruitment modifies CME kinetics . At Nef + sites , Nef increases AP - 2 recruitment . The Nef + CME sites show increased productivity , meaning that more sites mature to vesicles with more AP - 2 and presumably more cargo , resulting in more efficient internalization of Nef target proteins through CME .
